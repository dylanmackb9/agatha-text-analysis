    "TOWARDS ZERO\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fPrologue November 19th\n\nThe group round the fireplace was nearly all composed of lawyers or\nthose who had an interest in the law.",
    "There was Martindale the\nsolicitor Rufus Lord K.C.",
    "young Daniels who had made a name for\nhimself in the Carstairs case a sprinkling of other barristers Mr.\nJustice Cleaver Lewis of Lewis and Trench and old Mr. Treves.",
    "Mr.\nTreves was dose on eighty a very ripe and experienced eighty.",
    "He was\na member of a famous firm of solicitors and the most famous member\nof that firm.",
    "He had settled innumerable delicate cases out of court he\nwas said to know more of backstairs history than any man in England\nand he was a specialist on criminology.",
    "Unthinking people said Mr. Treves ought to write his memoirs.",
    "Mr.\nTreves knew better.",
    "He knew that he knew too much.",
    "Though he had long retired from active practice there was no man in\nEngland whose opinion was so respected by the members of his own\nfraternity.",
    "Whenever his thin precise little voice was raised there was\nalways a respectful silence.",
    "The conversation now was on the subject of a much talkedof case\nwhich had finished that day at the Old Bailey.",
    "It was a murder case and\nthe prisoner had been acquitted.",
    "The present company was busy\ntrying the case over again and making technical criticisms.",
    "The prosecution had made a mistake in relying on one of its witnesses\n old Depleach ought to have realised what an opening he was giving to\nthe defence.",
    "Young Arthur had made the most of that servant girls\nevidence.",
    "Bentmore in his summingup had very rightly put the\nmatter in its correct perspective but the mischief was done by then the jury had believed the girl.",
    "Juries were funny  you never knew what\ntheyd swallow and what they wouldnt.",
    "But let them once get a thing\ninto their heads and no one was ever going to get it out again.",
    "They\nbelieved that the girl was speaking the truth about the crowbar and\nthat was that.",
    "The medical evidence had been a bit above their heads.",
    "All those long terms and scientific jargon  damned bad witnesses\nthese scientific johnnies always hemmed and hawed and couldnt say\nyes or no to a plain question always in certain circumstances that\nmight take place  and so on\n\nThey talked themselves out little by little and as the remarks became\nmore spasmodic and disjointed a general feeling grew of something\nlacking.",
    "One head after another turned in the direction of Mr. Treves.",
    "For Mr. Treves had as yet contributed nothing to the discussion.",
    "Gradually it became apparent that the company was waiting for a final\nword from its most respected colleague.",
    "Mr. Treves leaning back in his chair was absentmindedly polishing\nhis glasses.",
    "Something in the silence made him look up sharply.",
    "Eh he said.",
    "What was that You asked me something\n\nYoung Lewis spoke.",
    "We were talking sir about the Lamorne case.",
    "He paused expectantly.",
    "Yes yes said Mr. Treves.",
    "I was thinking of that.",
    "There was a respectful hush.",
    "But Im afraid said Mr. Treves still polishing that I was being\nfanciful.",
    "Yes fanciful.",
    "Result of getting on in years I suppose.",
    "At my\nage one can claim the privilege of being fanciful if one likes.",
    "Yes indeed sir said young Lewis but he looked puzzled.",
    "I was thinking said Mr. Treves not so much of the various points of\nlaw raised  though they were interesting  very interesting  if the\nverdict had gone the other way there would have been good grounds\nfor appeal I rather think but I wont go into that now.",
    "I was thinking as\nI say not of the points of law but of the  well of the people in the\ncase.",
    "Everybody looked rather astonished.",
    "They had considered the people\nin the case only as regarding their credibility or otherwise as\nwitnesses.",
    "No one had even hazarded a speculation as to whether the\nprisoner had been guilty or as innocent as the court had pronounced\nhim to be.",
    "Human beings you know said Mr. Treves thoughtfully.",
    "Human\nbeings.",
    "All kinds and sorts and sizes and shapes of em.",
    "Some with\nbrains and a good many more without.",
    "Theyd come from all over the\nplace Lancashire Scotland  that restaurant proprietor from Italy and\n\n\fthat schoolteacher woman from somewhere out Middle West.",
    "All\ncaught up and enmeshed in the thing and finally all brought together in\na court of law in London on a grey November day.",
    "Each one\ncontributing his little part.",
    "The whole thing culminating in a trial for\nmurder.",
    "He paused and gently beat a delicate tattoo on his knee.",
    "I like a good detective story he said.",
    "But you know they begin in\nthe wrong place They begin with the murder.",
    "But the murder is the\nend.",
    "The story begins long before that  years before sometimes  with\nall the causes and events that bring certain people to a certain place\nat a certain time on a certain day.",
    "Take that little maidservants\nevidence  if the kitchenmaid hadnt pinched her young man she\nwouldnt have thrown up her situation in a huff and gone to the\nLamornes and been the principal witness for the defence.",
    "That\nGuiseppe Antonelli  coming over to exchange with his brother for a\nmonth.",
    "The brother is as blind as a bat.",
    "He wouldnt have seen what\nGuiseppes sharp eyes saw.",
    "If the constable hadnt been sweet on the\ncook at No.",
    "48 he wouldnt have been late on his beat ...",
    "He nodded his head gently All converging towards a given spot ...\nAnd then when the time comes  over the top Zero Hour.",
    "Yes all of\nthem converging towards zero ...",
    "He repeated.",
    "Towards zero ... Then gave a quick little shudder.",
    "Youre cold sir come nearer the fire.",
    "No no said Mr. Treves.",
    "Just someone walking over my grave as\nthey say.",
    "Well well I must be making my way homewards.",
    "He gave an affable little nod and went slowly and precisely out of the\nroom.",
    "There was a moment of dubious silence and then Rufus Lord K.C.",
    "remarked that poor old Treves was getting on.",
    "Sir William Cleaver said An acute brain  a very acute brain  but\nAnno Domini tells in the end.",
    "Got a groggy heart too said Lord.",
    "May drop down any minute I\nbelieve.",
    "He takes pretty good care of himself said young Lewis.",
    "At that moment Mr. Treves was carefully stepping into his smoothrunning Daimler.",
    "It deposited him at a house in a quiet square.",
    "A\nsolicitous butlervalet helped him off with his coat.",
    "Mr. Treves walked\ninto his library where a coal fire was burning.",
    "His bedroom lay\nbeyond for out of consideration for his heart he never went upstairs.",
    "He sat down in front of the fire and drew his letters towards him.",
    "His\nmind was still dwelling on the fancy he had outlined at the Club.",
    "Even now thought Mr. Treves to himself some drama  some\nmurder to be is in course of preparation.",
    "If I were writing one of these\namusing stories of blood and crime I should begin now with an elderly\ngentleman sitting in front of the fire opening his letters  going unbeknownst to himself  towards zero ...",
    "He slit open an envelope and gazed down absently at the sheet he\nabstracted from it.",
    "Suddenly his expression changed.",
    "He came back from romance to\nreality.",
    "Dear me said Mr. Treves.",
    "How extremely annoying Really how\nvery vexing After all these years This will alter all my plans.",
    "Open the Door and Here Are the People\n\nJanuary 11th.",
    "The man in the hospital bed shifted his body slightly and stifled a\ngroan.",
    "The nurse in charge of the ward got up from her table and came down\nto him.",
    "She shifted his pillows and moved him into a more comfortable\nposition.",
    "Angus MacWhirter only gave a grunt by way of thanks.",
    "He was in a\nstate of seething rebellion and bitterness.",
    "By this time it ought all to have been over.",
    "He ought to have been out of\nit all Curse that damned ridiculous tree growing out of the cliff Curse\nthose officious sweethearts who braved the cold of a winters night to\nkeep a tryst on the cliff edge.",
    "But for them and the tree it would have been over  a plunge into the\ndeep icy water a brief struggle perhaps and then oblivion  the end of\na misused useless unprofitable life.",
    "And now where was he Lying ridiculously in a hospital bed with a\nbroken shoulder and with the prospect of being hauled up in a police\ncourt for the crime of trying to take his own life.",
    "Curse it it was his own life wasnt it\n\nAnd if he had succeeded in the job they would have buried him piously\nas of unsound mind\n\nUnsound mind indeed Hed never been saner And to commit suicide\nwas the most logical and sensible thing that could be done by a man in\nhis position.",
    "Completely down and out with his health permanently affected with a\nwife who had left him for another man.",
    "Without a job without affection\nwithout money health or hope surely to end it all was the only\npossible solution\n\nAnd now here he was in this ridiculous plight.",
    "He would shortly be\nadmonished by a sanctimonious magistrate for doing the commonsense thing with a commodity which belonged to him and to him only his life.",
    "He snorted with anger.",
    "A wave of fever passed over him.",
    "The nurse was beside him again.",
    "She was young redhaired with a\nkindly rather vacant face.",
    "Are you in much pain\n\n\fNo Im not.",
    "Ill give you something to make you sleep.",
    "Youll do nothing of the sort.",
    "But \n\nDo you think I cant bear a bit of pain and sleeplessness\n\nShe smiled in a gentle slightly superior way.",
    "Doctor said you could have something.",
    "I dont care what doctor said.",
    "She straightened the covers and set a glass of lemonade a little nearer\nto him.",
    "He said slightly ashamed of himself Sorry if I was rude.",
    "Oh thats all right.",
    "It annoyed him that she was so completely undisturbed by his bad\ntemper.",
    "Nothing like that could penetrate her nurses armour of\nindulgent indifference.",
    "He was a patient  not a man.",
    "He said Damned interference  all this damned interference ...\n\nShe said reprovingly Now now that isnt very nice.",
    "Nice he demanded.",
    "Nice My God\n\n\fShe said calmly Youll feel better in the morning.",
    "He swallowed.",
    "You nurses.",
    "You nurses Youre inhuman thats what\nyou are\n\nWe know whats best for you you see.",
    "Thats whats so infuriating About you.",
    "About a hospital.",
    "About the\nworld.",
    "Continual interference Knowing whats best for other people.",
    "I\ntried to kill myself.",
    "You know that dont you\n\nShe nodded.",
    "Nobodys business but mine whether I threw myself off a bloody cliff\nor not.",
    "Id finished with life.",
    "I was down and out\n\nShe made a little clicking noise with her tongue.",
    "It indicated abstract\nsympathy.",
    "He was a patient.",
    "She was soothing him by letting him blow\noff steam.",
    "Why shouldnt I kill myself if I want to he demanded.",
    "She replied to\nthat quite seriously.",
    "Because its wrong.",
    "She looked at him doubtfully.",
    "She was not disturbed in her own belief\nbut she was much too inarticulate to explain her reaction.",
    "Well I mean  its wicked to kill yourself.",
    "Youve got to go on living\nwhether you like it or not.",
    "Why have you\n\nWell there are other people to consider arent there\n\nNot in my case.",
    "Theres not a soul in the world whod be the worse for\nmy passing on.",
    "Havent you got any relations No mother or sisters or anything\n\nNo.",
    "I had a wife once but she left me  quite right too She saw I was\nno good.",
    "But youve got friends surely\n\nNo I havent.",
    "Im not a friendly sort of man.",
    "Look here nurse Ill tell\nyou something.",
    "I was a happy sort of chap once.",
    "Had a good job and a\ngoodlooking wife.",
    "There was a car accident.",
    "My boss was driving the\ncar and I was in it.",
    "He wanted me to say he was driving under thirty at\nthe time of the accident.",
    "He wasnt.",
    "He was driving nearer fifty.",
    "Nobody was killed nothing like that he just wanted to be in the right\nfor the insurance people.",
    "Well I wouldnt say what he wanted.",
    "It was a\nlie.",
    "I dont tell lies.",
    "The nurse said Well I think you were quite right.",
    "Quite right.",
    "You do do you That pigheadedness of mine cost me my job.",
    "My\nboss was sore.",
    "He saw to it that I didnt get another.",
    "My wife got fed up\nseeing me much about unable to get anything to do.",
    "She went off with\na man who had been my friend.",
    "He was doing well and going up in the\nworld.",
    "I drifted along going steadily down.",
    "I took to drinking a bit.",
    "That\n\n\fdidnt help me to hold down jobs.",
    "Finally I came down to hauling strained my inside  the doctor told me Id never be strong again.",
    "Well\nthere wasnt much to live for then.",
    "Easiest way and the cleanest way\nwas to go right out.",
    "My life was no good to myself or anyone else.",
    "The little nurse murmured You dont know that.",
    "He laughed.",
    "He was bettertempered already.",
    "Her naive obstinacy\namused him.",
    "My dear girl what use am I to anybody\n\nShe said confusedly You dont know.",
    "You may be  some day \n\nSome day There wont be any some day.",
    "Next time I shall make\nsure.",
    "She shook her head decidedly.",
    "Oh no she said.",
    "You wont kill yourself now.",
    "Why not They\nnever do.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "They never do.",
    "He was one of a class of wouldbe\nsuicides.",
    "Opening his mouth to protest energetically his innate\nhonesty suddenly stopped him.",
    "Would he do it again Did he really mean to do it\n\n\fHe knew suddenly that he didnt.",
    "For no reason.",
    "Perhaps the right\nreason was the one she had given out of her specialised knowledge.",
    "Suicides didnt do it again.",
    "All the more he felt determined to force an admission from her on the\nethical side.",
    "At any rate Ive got a right to do what I like with my own life.",
    "No  no you havent.",
    "But why not my dear girl why\n\nShe flushed.",
    "She said her fingers playing with the little gold cross that\nhung round her neck You dont understand.",
    "God may need you.",
    "He stared  taken aback.",
    "He did not want to upset her childlike faith.",
    "He said mockingly I suppose that one day I may stop a runaway\nhorse and save a goldenhaired child from death  eh Is that it\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "She said with vehemence and trying to express\nwhat was so vivid in her mind and so halting on her tongue It may be\njust by being somewhere  not doing anything  just by being at a\ncertain place at a certain time  oh I cant say what I mean but you\nmight just  just walk along a street some day and just by doing that\naccomplish something terribly important perhaps even without\nknowing what it was.",
    "The redhaired little nurse came from the west coast of Scotland and\nsome of her family had the sight.",
    "Perhaps dimly she saw a picture of a man walking up a road on a\nnight in September and thereby saving a human being from a terrible\ndeath ...\n\nFebruary 14th.",
    "There was only one person in the room and the only sound to be heard\nwas the scratching of that persons pen as it traced line after line\nacross the paper.",
    "There was no one to read the words that were being traced.",
    "If there\nhad been they would hardly have believed their eyes.",
    "For what was\nbeing written was a clear carefully detailed project for murder.",
    "There are times when a body is conscious of a mind controlling it when it bows obedient to that alien something that controls its actions.",
    "There are other times when a mind is conscious of owning and\ncontrolling a body and accomplishing its purpose by using that body.",
    "The figure sitting writing was in the lastnamed state.",
    "It was a mind a\ncool controlled intelligence.",
    "This mind had only one thought and one\npurpose  the destruction of another human being.",
    "To the end that this\npurpose might be accomplished the scheme was being worked out\nmeticulously on paper.",
    "Every eventuality every possibility was being\ntaken into account.",
    "The thing had got to be absolutely foolproof.",
    "The\nscheme like all good schemes not absolutely cut and dried.",
    "There\nwere certain actions at certain points.",
    "Moreover since the mind was\nintelligent it realised that there must be intelligent provision left for\n\n\fthe unforeseen.",
    "But the main lines were clear and had been closely\ntested.",
    "The time the place the method the victim ...",
    "The figure raised its head.",
    "With its hand it picked up the sheets of\npaper and read them carefully through.",
    "Yes the thing was crystal\nclear.",
    "Across the serious face a smile came.",
    "It was a smile that was not quite\nsane.",
    "The figure drew a deep breath.",
    "As man was made in the image of his Maker so there was now a\nterrible travesty of a creators joy.",
    "Yes everything planned  everyones reaction foretold and allowed for\nthe good and evil in everybody played upon and brought into harmony\nwith one evil design.",
    "There was one thing lacking still...\n\nWith a smile the writer traced a date  a date in September.",
    "Then with a laugh the paper was torn in pieces and the pieces carried\nacross the room and put into the heart of the glowing fire.",
    "There was\nno carelessness.",
    "Every single piece was consumed and destroyed.",
    "The plan was now only existent in the brain of its creator.",
    "March 8th.",
    "Superintendent Battle was sitting at the breakfast table.",
    "His jaw was\nset in a truculent fashion and he was reading slowly and carefully a\n\n\fletter that his wife had just tearfully handed to him.",
    "There was no\nexpression visible on his face for his face never did register any\nexpression.",
    "It had the aspect of a face carved out of wood.",
    "It was solid\nand durable and in some way impressive.",
    "Superintendent Battle had\nnever suggested brilliance he was definitely not a brilliant man but\nhe had some other quality difficult to define that was nevertheless\nforceful.",
    "I cant believe it said Mrs. Battle sobbing.",
    "Sylvia\n\nSylvia was the youngest of Superintendent and Mrs.",
    "Battles five\nchildren.",
    "She was sixteen and at school near Maidstone.",
    "The letter was from Miss Amphrey headmistress of the school in\nquestion.",
    "It was a clear kindly and extremely tactful letter.",
    "It set out in\nblack and white that various small thefts had been puzzling the school\nauthorities for some time that the matter had been at last cleared up\nthat Sylvia Battle had confessed and that Miss Amphrey would like to\nsee Mr. and Mrs. Battle at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss\nthe position.",
    "Superintendent Battle folded up the letter put it in his pocket and\nsaid You leave this to me Mary.",
    "He got up walked round the table patted her on the cheek and said\nDont worry dear it will be all right.",
    "He went from the room leaving comfort and reassurance behind him.",
    "That afternoon in Miss Amphreys modern and individualistic drawingroom Superintendent Battle sat very squarely on his chair his large\nwooden hands on his knees confronting Miss Amphrey and managing\nto look far more than usual every inch a policeman.",
    "Miss Amphrey was a very successful headmistress.",
    "She had\npersonality  a great deal of personality she was enlightened and up to\ndate and she combined discipline with modern ideas of selfdetermination.",
    "Her room was representative of the spirit of Meadway.",
    "Everything was\nof a cool oatmeal colour  there were big jars of daffodils and bowls of\ntulips and hyacinths.",
    "One or two good copies of the antique Greek two\npieces of advanced modern sculpture two Italian primitives on the\nwalls.",
    "In the midst of all this Miss Amphrey herself dressed in a deep\nshade of blue with an eager face suggestive of a conscientious\ngreyhound and clear blue eyes looking serious through thick lenses.",
    "The important thing she was saying in her clear wellmodulated\nvoice is that this should be taken the right way.",
    "It is the girl herself\nwe have to think of Mr. Battle.",
    "Sylvia herself It is most important most important  that her life should not be crippled in any way.",
    "She\nmust not be made to assume a burden of guilt blame must be very\nvery sparingly meted out if at all.",
    "We must arrive at the reason behind\nthese quite trivial pilferings.",
    "A sense of inferiority perhaps She is not\ngood at games you know  an obscure wish to shine in a different\nsphere the desire to assert her ego We must be very very careful.",
    "That is why I wanted to see you alone first  to impress upon you to be\nvery very careful with Sylvia.",
    "I repeat again its very important to get\nat whats behind this.",
    "That Miss Amphrey said Superintendent Battle is why I have come\ndown.",
    "His voice was quiet his face unemotional his eyes surveyed the\nschoolmistress appraisingly.",
    "I have been very gentle with her said Miss Amphrey.",
    "Battle said laconically.",
    "Good for you Mam.",
    "You see I really love and understand these young things.",
    "Battle did not reply directly.",
    "He said Id like to see my girl now if you\ndont mind.",
    "Miss Amphrey.",
    "With renewed emphasis Miss Amphrey admonished him to be careful to go slow  not to antagonise a child just budding into womanhood.",
    "Superintendent Battle showed no signs of impatience.",
    "He just looked\nblank.",
    "She took him at last to her study.",
    "They passed one or two girls in the\npassages.",
    "They stood politely to attention but their eyes were full of\ncuriosity.",
    "Having ushered Battle into a small room not quite so\nredolent of personality as the one downstairs Miss Amphrey withdrew\nand said she would send Sylvia to him.",
    "Just as she was leaving the room.",
    "Battle stopped her.",
    "One minute Mam how did you come to pitch upon Sylvia as the one\nresponsible for these  er  leakages\n\nMy methods Mr. Battle were psychological.",
    "Miss Amphrey spoke with dignity.",
    "Psychological Hm.",
    "What about the evidence Miss Amphrey\n\nYes yes I quite understand Mr. Battle  you would feel that way.",
    "Your\n er profession steps in.",
    "But psychology is beginning to be recognised\nin criminology.",
    "I can assure you that there is no mistake  Sylvia freely\nadmits the whole thing.",
    "Battle nodded.",
    "Yes yes I know that.",
    "I was just asking how you came to pitch upon\nher to begin with.",
    "Well Mr. Battle this business of things being taken out of the girls\nlockers was on the increase.",
    "I called the school together and told them\nthe facts.",
    "At the same time I studied their faces unobtrusively.",
    "Sylvias\nexpression struck me at once.",
    "It was guilty  confused.",
    "I knew at that\nmoment who was responsible.",
    "I wanted not to confront her with her\nguilt but to get her to admit it herself.",
    "I set a little test for her  a word\ntest association.",
    "Battle nodded to show he understood.",
    "And finally the child admitted it all.",
    "Her father said I see.",
    "Miss Amphrey hesitated a minute then went out.",
    "Battle was standing looking out of the window when the door opened\nagain.",
    "He turned round slowly and looked at his daughter.",
    "Sylvia stood just inside the door which she had closed behind her.",
    "She\nwas tall dark angular.",
    "Her face was sullen and bore marks of tears.",
    "She said timidly rather than defiantly Well here I am.",
    "Battle looked at her thoughtfully for a minute or two.",
    "He sighed.",
    "I should never have sent you to this place he said.",
    "That womans a\nfool.",
    "Sylvia lost sight of her own problems in sheer amazement.",
    "Miss Amphrey Oh but shes wonderful.",
    "We all think so.",
    "Hm said Battle.",
    "Cant be quite a fool then if she sells the idea of\nherself as well as that.",
    "All the same Meadway wasnt the place for you\n although I dont know  this might have happened anywhere.",
    "Sylvia twisted her hands together.",
    "She looked down.",
    "She said Im Im sorry father.",
    "I really am.",
    "So you should be said Battle shortly.",
    "Come here.",
    "She came slowly and unwillingly across the room to him.",
    "He took her\nchin in his great square hand and looked closely into her face.",
    "Been through a good deal havent you he said gently.",
    "Tears started\ninto her eyes.",
    "Battle said slowly You see Sylvia Ive known all along with you that\nthere was something.",
    "Most people have got a weakness of some kind\nor another.",
    "Usually its plain enough.",
    "You can see when a childs\ngreedy or badtempered or got a streak of the bully in him.",
    "You were\na good child very quiet  very sweettempered  no trouble in any way and sometimes Ive worried.",
    "Because if theres a flaw you dont see\nsometimes it wrecks the whole show when the article is tried out.",
    "Like me said Sylvia.",
    "Yes like you.",
    "Youve cracked under strain  and in a damned queer\nway too.",
    "Its a way oddly enough Ive never come across before.",
    "The girl said suddenly and scornfully I should think youd come\nacross thieves often enough\n\nOh yes I know all about them.",
    "And thats why my dear  not because\nIm your father fathers dont know much about their children but\nbecause Im a policeman I know well enough youre not a thief You\nnever took a thing in this place.",
    "Thieves are of two kinds the kind that\nyields to sudden and overwhelming temptation and that happens\ndamned seldom  its amazing what temptation the ordinary normal\n\n\fhonest human being can withstand  and theres the kind that just\ntakes what doesnt belong to them almost as a matter of course.",
    "You\ndont belong to either type.",
    "Youre not a thief.",
    "Youre a very unusual\ntype of liar.",
    "Sylvia began But  He swept on.",
    "Youve admitted it all Oh yes I know that.",
    "There was a Saint once went out with bread for the poor.",
    "Husband didnt like it.",
    "Met her and\nasked what there was in her basket.",
    "She lost her nerve and said it was\nroses  he tore open her basket and roses it was  a miracle Now if\nyoud been Saint Elizabeth and were out with a basket of roses and\nyour husband had come along and asked you what youd got youd\nhave lost your nerve and said Bread.",
    "He paused and then said gently Thats how it happened isnt it\nThere was a longer pause and then the girl suddenly bent her head.",
    "Battle said Tell me child.",
    "What happened exactly\n\nShe had us all up.",
    "Made a speech.",
    "And I saw her eyes on me and I\nknew she thought it was me I felt myself getting red  and I saw some\nof the girls looking at me.",
    "It was awful.",
    "And then the others began\nlooking at me and whispering in corners.",
    "I could see they all thought\nso.",
    "And then the Amp had me up here with some of the others one\nevening and we played a sort of wordgame  she said words and we\ngave answers \n\nBattle gave a disgusted grunt.",
    "And I could see what it meant  and  and I sort of got paralysed.",
    "I tried\nnot to give the wrong word I tried to think of things quite outside  like\nsquirrels or flowers  and the Amp was there watching me with eyes\nlike gimlets  you know sort of boring inside one.",
    "And after that  oh it\ngot worse and worse and one day the Amp talked to me quite kindly\nand so  so understandingly  and  and I broke down and said I had\ndone it  and oh Daddy the relief\n\nBattle was stroking his chin.",
    "I see.",
    "You do understand\n\nNo Sylvia I dont understand because Im not made that way.",
    "If\nanyone tried to make me say Id done something I hadnt Id feel more\nlike giving them a sock on the jaw.",
    "But I see how it came about in your\ncase  and that gimleteyed Amp of yours has had as pretty an example\nof unusual psychology shoved under her nose as any halfbaked\nexponent of misunderstood theories could ask for.",
    "The thing to do now\nis to clear up this mess.",
    "Wheres Miss Amphrey\n\nMiss Amphrey was hovering tactfully near at hand.",
    "Her sympathetic\nsmile froze on her face as Superintendent Battle said bluntly In\njustice to my daughter I must ask that you call in your local police over\nthis.",
    "But Mr. Battle Sylvia herself \n\n\fSylvia has never touched a thing that didnt belong to her in this\nplace.",
    "I quite understand that as a father \n\nIm not talking as a father but as a policeman.",
    "Get the police to give\nyou a hand over this.",
    "Theyll be discreet.",
    "Youll find the things hidden\naway somewhere and the right set of fingerprints on them I expect.",
    "Petty pilferers dont think of wearing gloves.",
    "Im taking my daughter\naway with me now.",
    "If the police find evidence  real evidence  to\nconnect her with the thefts Im prepared for her to appear in court and\ntake whats coming to her but Im not afraid.",
    "As he drove out of the gate with Sylvia beside him some five minutes\nlater he asked Whos a girl with fair hair rather fuzzy very pink\ncheeks and a spot on her chin blue eyes far apart I passed her in the\npassage.",
    "That sounds like Olive Parsons.",
    "Ah well I shouldnt be surprised if she were the one.",
    "Did she look frightened\n\nNo looked smug Calm smug look Ive seen in the police court\nhundreds of times Id bet good money shes the thief  but you wont\nfind her confessing not much\n\n\fSylvia said with a sigh Its like coming out of a bad dream.",
    "Oh Daddy\nI am sorry Oh I am sorry How could I be such a fool such an utter\nfool I do feel awful about it.",
    "Ah well said Superintendent Battle patting her on the arm with a\nhand he disengaged from the wheel and uttering one of his pet forms\nof trite consolation.",
    "Dont you worry.",
    "These things are sent to try us.",
    "Yes these things are sent to try us.",
    "At least I suppose so.",
    "I dont see\nwhat else they can be sent for ...\n\nApril 19th.",
    "The sun was pouring down on Nevile Stranges house at Hindhead.",
    "It was an April day such as usually occurs at least once in a month\nhotter than most of the June days to follow.",
    "Nevile Strange was coming down the stairs.",
    "He was dressed in white\nflannels and held four tennis racquets under his arm.",
    "If a man could have been selected from amongst other Englishmen as\nan example of a lucky man with nothing to wish for a Selection\nCommittee might have chosen Nevile Strange.",
    "He was a man well\nknown to the British public a firstclass tennis player and allround\nsportsman.",
    "Though he had never reached the finals at Wimbledon he\nhad lasted several of the opening rounds and in the mixed doubles had\ntwice reached the semifinals.",
    "He was perhaps too much of an allround athlete to be a champion tennis player.",
    "He was scratch at golf a\nfine swimmer and had done some good climbs in the Alps.",
    "He was\nthirtythree had magnificent health good looks plenty of money an\n\n\fextremely beautiful wife whom he had recently married and to all\nappearances no cares or worries.",
    "Nevertheless as Nevile Strange went downstairs this fine morning a\nshadow went with him.",
    "A shadow perceptible perhaps to no eyes but\nhis.",
    "But he was aware of it the thought of it furrowed his brow and\nmade his expression troubled and indecisive.",
    "He crossed the hall squared his shoulders as though definitely\nthrowing off some burden passed through the livingroom and out on\nto a glassenclosed verandah where his wife Kay was curled up\namongst cushions drinking orange juice.",
    "Kay Strange was twentythree and unusually beautiful.",
    "She had a\nslender but subtly voluptuous figure dark red hair such a perfect skin\nthat she used only the slightest makeup to enhance it and those dark\neyes and brows which so seldom go with red hair and which are so\ndevastating when they do.",
    "Her husband said lightly Hullo Gorgeous whats for breakfast\n\nKay replied Horribly bloodylooking kidneys for you  and mushrooms\n and rolls of bacon.",
    "Sounds all right said Nevile.",
    "He helped himself to the aforementioned viands and poured out a cup\nof coffee.",
    "There was a companionable silence for some minutes.",
    "Oo said Kay voluptuously wriggling bare toes with scarlet\nmanicured nails.",
    "Isnt the sun lovely Englands not so bad after all.",
    "They had just come back from the South of France.",
    "Nevile after a bare glance at the newspaper headlines had turned to\nthe sports page and merely said Um ...\n\nThen proceeding to toast and marmalade he put the paper aside and\nopened his letters.",
    "There were a good many of these but most of them he tore across and\nchucked away.",
    "Circulars advertisements printed matter.",
    "Kay said I dont like my colour scheme in the livingroom.",
    "Can I have\nit done over Nevile\n\nAnything you like Beautiful.",
    "Peacock blue said Kay dreamily and ivory satin cushions.",
    "Youll have to throw in an ape said Nevile.",
    "You can be the ape said Kay.",
    "Nevile opened another letter.",
    "Oh by the way said Kay.",
    "Shirty has asked us to go to Norway on\nthe yacht at the end of June.",
    "Rather sickening we cant.",
    "She looked\ncautiously sideways at Nevile and added wistfully I would love it so.",
    "Something some cloud some uncertainty seemed hovering on\nNeviles face.",
    "Kay said rebelliously Have we got to go to dreary old\nCamillas Nevile frowned.",
    "Of course we have.",
    "Look here Kay weve had this out before.",
    "Sir\nMatthew was my guardian.",
    "He and Camilla looked after me.",
    "Gulls\nPoint is my home as far as any place is home to me.",
    "Oh all right all right said Kay.",
    "If we must we must.",
    "After all we\nget all that money when she dies so I suppose we have to suck up a\nbit.",
    "Nevile said angrily Its not a question of sucking up Shes no control\nover the money.",
    "Sir Matthew left it in trust for her during her lifetime\nand to come to me and my wife afterwards.",
    "Its a question of affection.",
    "Why cant you understand that\n\nKay said after a moments pause I do understand really.",
    "Im just\nputting on an act because  well because I know Im only allowed there\non sufferance as it were.",
    "They hate me Yes they do Lady Tressilian\nlooks down that long nose of hers at me and Mary Aldin looks over my\nshoulder when she talks to me.",
    "Its all very well for you.",
    "You dont see\nwhat goes on.",
    "They always seem to be very polite to you.",
    "You know very well I\nwouldnt stand for it if they werent.",
    "Kay gave him a curious look from under her dark lashes.",
    "Theyre polite enough.",
    "But they know how to get under my skin all\nright.",
    "Im the interloper thats what they feel.",
    "Well said Nevile after all I suppose  thats natural enough isnt\nit\n\nHis voice had changed slightly.",
    "He got up and stood looking out at the\nview with his back to Kay.",
    "Oh yes I dare say its natural.",
    "They were devoted to Audrey werent\nthey Her voice shook a little.",
    "Dear wellbred cool colourless\nAudrey Camillas not forgiven me for taking her place.",
    "Nevile did not turn.",
    "His voice was lifeless dull.",
    "He said After all\nCamillas old past seventy.",
    "Her generation doesnt really like divorce\nyou know.",
    "On the whole I think shes accepted the position very well\nconsidering how fond she was of  of Audrey.",
    "His voice changed just a little as he spoke the name.",
    "They think you treated her badly.",
    "So I did said Nevile under his breath but his wife heard.",
    "Oh Nevile  dont be so stupid.",
    "Just because she chose to make such\na frightful fuss.",
    "She didnt make a fuss.",
    "Audrey never made fusses.",
    "Well you know what I mean.",
    "Because she went away and was ill and\nwent about everywhere looking brokenhearted.",
    "Thats what I call a\nfuss Audreys not what I call a good loser.",
    "From my point of view if a\nwife cant hold her husband she ought to give him up gracefully You\ntwo had nothing in common.",
    "She never played a game and was as\nanaemic and washed up as  as a dishrag.",
    "No life or go in her If she\nreally cared about you she ought to have thought about your\nhappiness first and been glad you were going to be happy with\nsomeone more suited to you.",
    "Nevile turned.",
    "A faintly sardonic smile played round his lips.",
    "What a\nlittle sportsman How to play the game in love and matrimony\n\nKay laughed and reddened.",
    "Well perhaps I was going a bit too far.",
    "But at any rate once the thing\nhad happened there it was.",
    "Youve got to accept these things\n\nNevile said quietly Audrey accepted it.",
    "She divorced me so that you\nand I could marry.",
    "Yes I know  Kay hesitated.",
    "Nevile said Youve never understood Audrey.",
    "No I havent.",
    "In a way Audrey gives me the creeps.",
    "I dont know what\nit is about her.",
    "You never know what shes thinking ... Shes  shes a\nlittle frightening.",
    "Oh nonsense Kay.",
    "Well she frightens me.",
    "Perhaps its because shes got brains.",
    "My lovely nitwit.",
    "Kay laughed.",
    "You always call me that\n\nBecause its what you are\n\nThey smiled at each other.",
    "Nevile came over to her and bending down\nkissed the back of her neck.",
    "Lovely lovely Kay he murmured.",
    "Very good Kay said Kay.",
    "Giving up a lovely yachting trip to go and\nbe snubbed by her husbands prim Victorian relations.",
    "Nevile went back and sat down by the table.",
    "You know he said.",
    "I dont see why we shouldnt go on that trip with\nShirty if you really want to so much.",
    "Kay sat up in astonishment.",
    "And what about Saltcreek and Gulls Point\n\nNevile said in a rather unnatural voice I dont see why we shouldnt\ngo there early in September.",
    "Oh but Nevile surely   She stopped.",
    "We cant go in July and August because of the Tournaments said\nNevile.",
    "But wed finish up at St. Loo the last week in August and it\nwould fit in very well if we went on to Saltcreek from there.",
    "Oh it would fit in all right  beautifully.",
    "But I thought  well she always\ngoes there for September doesnt she\n\nAudrey you mean\n\nYes.",
    "I suppose they could put her off but \n\nWhy should they put her off\n\nKay stared at him dubiously.",
    "You mean wed be there at the same time What an extraordinary\nidea\n\nNevile said irritably I dont think its at all an extraordinary idea.",
    "Lots\nof people do it nowadays.",
    "Why shouldnt we all be friends together It\nmakes things so much simpler.",
    "Why you said so yourself only the\nother day.",
    "I did\n\n\fYes dont you remember We were talking about the Howes and you\nsaid it was the sensible civilised way to look at things and that\nLeonards new wife and his Ex were the best of friends.",
    "Oh I wouldnt mind.",
    "I do think its sensible.",
    "But  well I dont think\nAudrey would feel like that about it.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "It isnt nonsense.",
    "You know Nevile Audrey really was terribly fond of\nyou ...",
    "I dont think shed stand it for a moment.",
    "Youre quite wrong Kay.",
    "Audrey thinks it would be quite a good\nthing.",
    "Audrey  what do you mean Audrey thinks How do you know what\nAudrey thinks\n\nNevile looked slightly embarrassed.",
    "He cleared his throat a little selfconsciously.",
    "As a matter of fact I happened to run into her yesterday when I was\nup in London.",
    "You never told me.",
    "Nevile said irritably Im telling you now.",
    "It was absolute chance.",
    "I was\nwalking across the Park and there she was coming towards me.",
    "You\nwouldnt want me to run away from her would you\n\n\fNo of course not said Kay staring.",
    "Go on.",
    "I  we  well we stopped of course and then I turned round and\nwalked with her.",
    "I I felt it was the least I could do.",
    "Go on said Kay.",
    "And then we sat down on a couple of chairs and talked.",
    "She was very\nnice  very nice indeed.",
    "Delightful for you said Kay.",
    "And we got talking you know about one thing and another.",
    "She was\nquite natural and normal  and  and all that.",
    "Remarkable said Kay.",
    "And she asked how you were \n\nVery kind of her\n\nAnd we talked about you for a bit.",
    "Really Kay she couldnt have been\nnicer.",
    "Darling Audrey\n\nAnd then it sort of came to me  you know  how nice it would be if  if\nyou two could be friends  if we could all get together.",
    "And it occurred\nto me that perhaps we might manage it at Gulls Point this summer.",
    "Sort of place it could happen quite naturally.",
    "You thought of that\n\nI  well  yes of course.",
    "It was all my idea.",
    "Youve never said anything to me about having any such idea.",
    "Well I only happened to think of it just then.",
    "I see.",
    "Anyway you suggested it and Audrey thought it was a\nmarvellous brainwave\n\nFor the first time something in Kays manner seemed to penetrate to\nNeviles consciousness.",
    "He said Is anything the matter Gorgeous\n\nOh no nothing Nothing at all It didnt occur to you or Audrey\nwhether I should think it a marvellous idea\n\nNevile stared at her.",
    "But Kay why on earth should you mind\n\nKay bit her lip.",
    "Nevile went on You said yourself  only the other day \n\nOh dont go into all that again I was talking about other people  not\nus.",
    "But thats partly what made me think of it.",
    "More fool me.",
    "Not that I believe that.",
    "Nevile was looking at her with dismay.",
    "But Kay why should you mind I mean theres nothing for you to\nmind about\n\nIsnt there\n\nWell I mean  any jealousy or that  would be on the other side.",
    "He\npaused his voice changed.",
    "You see Kay you and I treated Audrey\ndamned badly.",
    "No I dont mean that.",
    "It was nothing to do with you.",
    "I\ntreated her very badly.",
    "Its no good just saying that I couldnt help\nmyself.",
    "I feel that if this could come off Id feel better about the whole\nthing.",
    "It would make me a lot happier.",
    "Kay said slowly So you havent been happy\n\nDarling idiot what do you mean Of course Ive been happy radiantly\nhappy.",
    "But \n\nKay cut in.",
    "But  thats it Theres always been a but in this house.",
    "Some damned\ncreeping shadow about the place.",
    "Audreys shadow.",
    "Nevile stared at her.",
    "You mean to say youre jealous of Audrey he said.",
    "Im not jealous of her.",
    "Im afraid of her ... Nevile you dont know what\nAudreys like.",
    "Not know what shes like when Ive been married to her for over eight\nyears\n\nYou dont know Kay repeated what Audrey is like.",
    "April 30th.",
    "Preposterous said Lady Tressilian.",
    "She drew herself up on her\npillow and glared fiercely round the room.",
    "Absolutely preposterous Nevile must be mad.",
    "It does seem rather\nodd said Mary Aldin.",
    "Lady Tressilian had a strikinglooking profile with a slender bridged\nnose down which when so inclined she could look with telling effect.",
    "Though now over seventy and in frail health her native vigour of mind\nwas in no way impaired.",
    "She had it is true long periods of retreat from\nlife and its emotions when she would lie with halfclosed eyes but from\nthese semicomas she would emerge with all her faculties sharpened\nto the uttermost and with an incisive tongue.",
    "Propped up by pillows in\na large bed set across one corner of her room she held her court like\nsome French Queen.",
    "Mary Aldin a distant cousin lived with her and\nlooked after her.",
    "The two women got on together excellently.",
    "Mary was\nthirtysix but had one of those smooth ageless faces that change little\n\n\fwith passing years.",
    "She might have been thirty or fortyfive.",
    "She had a\ngood figure an air of breeding and dark hair to which one lock of\nwhite across the front gave a touch of individuality.",
    "It was at one time a\nfashion but Marys white lock of hair was natural and she had had it\nsince her girlhood.",
    "She looked down now reflectively at Nevile Stranges letter which\nLady Tressilian had handed to her.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "It does seem rather odd.",
    "You cant tell me said Lady Tressilian that this is Neviles own idea\nSomebody put it into his head.",
    "Probably that new wife of his.",
    "Kay.",
    "You think it was Kays idea\n\nIt would be quite like her.",
    "New and vulgar.",
    "If husbands and wives\nhave to advertise their difficulties in public and have recourse to\ndivorce then they might at least part decently.",
    "The new wife and the\nold wife making friends is quite disgusting to my mind.",
    "Nobody has\nany standards nowadays\n\nI suppose it is just the modern way said Mary.",
    "It wont happen in my house said Lady Tressilian.",
    "I consider Ive\ndone all that could be asked of me having that scarlettoed creature\nhere at all.",
    "She is Neviles wife.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Therefore I felt that Matthew would have wished it.",
    "He was\ndevoted to the boy and always wanted him to look on this as his home.",
    "Since to refuse to receive his wife would have made an open breach I\ngave way and asked her here.",
    "I do not like her  shes quite the wrong\nwife for Nevile  no background no roots\n\nShes quite well born said Mary placatingly.",
    "Bad stock said Lady Tressilian.",
    "Her father as Ive told you had to\nresign from all his clubs after that card business.",
    "Luckily he died\nshortly after.",
    "And her mother was notorious on the Riviera.",
    "What a\nbringingup for the girl Nothing but hotel life  and that mother Then\nshe meets Nevile on the tennis courts makes a dead set at him and\nnever rests until she gets him to leave his wife  of whom he was\nextremely fond  and go off with her I blame her entirely for the whole\nthing\n\nMary\n\nsmiled\n\nfaintly.",
    "Lady\n\nTressilian\n\nhad\n\nthe\n\noldfashioned\n\ncharacteristic of always blaming the woman and being indulgent\ntowards the man in the case.",
    "I suppose strictly speaking Nevile was equally to blame she\nsuggested.",
    "Nevile was very much to blame agreed Lady Tressilian.",
    "He had a\ncharming wife who had always been devoted  perhaps too devoted to him.",
    "Nevertheless if it hadnt been for that girls persistence I am\nconvinced he would have come to his senses.",
    "But she was determined\nto marry him Yes my sympathies are entirely with Audrey.",
    "I am very\nfond of Audrey.",
    "Mary sighed.",
    "It has all been very difficult she said.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "One is at a loss to know how to act in such difficult\ncircumstances.",
    "Matthew was fond of Audrey and so am I and one\ncannot deny that she was a very good wife to Nevile though perhaps it\nis a pity that she could not have shared his amusements more.",
    "She\nwas never an athletic girl.",
    "The whole business was very distressing.",
    "When I was a girl these things simply did not happen.",
    "Men had their\naffairs naturally but they were not allowed to break up married life.",
    "Well they happen now said Mary bluntly.",
    "Exactly.",
    "You have so much common sense dear.",
    "It is of no use\nrecalling bygone days.",
    "These things happen and girls like Kay\nMortimer steal other womens husbands and nobody thinks the worse\nof them\n\nExcept people like you Camilla\n\nI dont count.",
    "That Kay creature doesnt worry whether I approve of\nher or not.",
    "Shes too busy having a good time.",
    "Nevile can bring her\nhere when he comes and Im even willing to receive her friends though I do not much care for that very theatricallooking young man\nwho is always hanging round her  what is his name\n\nTed Latimer\n\nThat is it.",
    "A friend of her Riviera days  and I should very much like to\nknow how he manages to live as he does.",
    "By his wits suggested Mary.",
    "One might pardon that.",
    "I rather fancy he lives by his looks.",
    "Not a\npleasant friend for Neviles wife I disliked the way he came down last\nsummer and stayed at the Easterhead Bay Hotel while they were\nhere.",
    "Mary looked out of the open window.",
    "Lady Tressilians house was\nsituated on a steep cliff overlooking the river Tern.",
    "On the other side of\nthe river was the newly created summer resort of Easterhead Bay\nconsisting of a big sandy bathing beach a cluster of modern\nbungalows and a large hotel on the headland looking out to sea.",
    "Saltcreek itself was a straggling picturesque fishing village set on the\nside of a hill.",
    "It was oldfashioned conservative and deeply\ncontemptuous of Easterhead Bay and its summer visitors.",
    "The Easterhead Bay Hotel was nearly exactly opposite Lady\nTressilians house and Mary looked across the narrow strip of water\nat it now where it stood in its blatant newness.",
    "I am glad said Lady Tressilian closing her eyes that Matthew\nnever saw that vulgar building.",
    "The coastline was quite unspoilt in his\ntime.",
    "Sir Matthew and Lady Tressilian had come to Gulls Point thirty years\nago.",
    "It was nine years since Sir Matthew an enthusiastic sailing man\nhad capsized his dinghy and been drowned almost in front of his wifes\neyes.",
    "Everybody had expected her to sell Gulls Point and leave Saltcreek\nbut Lady Tressilian had not done so.",
    "She had lived on in the house and\nher only visible reaction had been to dispose of all the boats and do\naway with the boathouse.",
    "There were no boats available for guests at\nGulls Point.",
    "They had to walk along to the ferry and hire a boat from\none of the rival boatmen there.",
    "Mary said hesitating a little Shall I write then to Nevile and tell him\nthat what he proposes does not fit in with our plans\n\nI certainly shall not dream of interfering with Audreys visit.",
    "She has\nalways come to us in September and I shall not ask her to change her\nplans.",
    "Mary said looking down at the letter You did see that Nevile says\nAudrey  er approves of the idea  that she is quite willing to meet\nKay\n\nI simply dont believe it said Lady Tressilian.",
    "Nevile like all men\nbelieves what he wants to believe\n\nMary persisted He says he has actually spoken to her about it.",
    "What a very odd thing to do No  perhaps after all it isnt.",
    "Mary looked at her inquiringly.",
    "Like Henry the Eighth said Lady Tressilian.",
    "Mary looked puzzled.",
    "Lady Tressilian elaborated her last remark.",
    "Conscience you know Henry was always trying to get Catherine to\nagree that the divorce was the right thing.",
    "Nevile knows that he has\nbehaved badly  he wants to feel comfortable about it all.",
    "So he has\nbeen trying to bully Audrey into saying everything is all right and that\nshell come and meet Kay and that she doesnt mind at all.",
    "I wonder said Mary slowly.",
    "Lady Tressilian looked at her sharply.",
    "Whats in your mind my dear\n\nI was wondering  She stopped then went on It  it seems so unlike\nNevile this letter You dont think that for some reason Audrey wants\nthis  this meeting\n\nWhy should she said Lady Tressilian sharply.",
    "After Nevile left her\nshe went to her aunt Mrs. Royde at the Rectory and had a complete\nbreakdown.",
    "She was absolutely like a ghost of her former self.",
    "Obviously it hit her terribly hard.",
    "Shes one of those quiet selfcontained people who feel things intensely.",
    "Mary moved uneasily.",
    "Yes she is intense.",
    "A queer girl in many ways ...\n\n\fShe suffered a lot ... Then the divorce went through and Nevile\nmarried the girl and little by little Audrey began to get over it.",
    "Now\nshes almost back to her old self.",
    "You cant tell me she wants to rake up\nold memories again.",
    "Mary said with gentle obstinacy Nevile says she does.",
    "The old lady\nlooked at her curiously.",
    "Youre extraordinarily obstinate about this Mary.",
    "Why Do you want\nto have them here together\n\nMary Aldin flushed.",
    "No of course not.",
    "Lady Tressilian said sharply Its not you who have been suggesting\nall this to Nevile\n\nHow can you be so absurd\n\nWell I dont believe for a minute its really his idea.",
    "Its not like\nNevile.",
    "She paused a minute then her face cleared.",
    "Its the 1st of\nMay tomorrow isnt it Well on the 3rd Audrey is coming to stay with\nthe Darlingtons at Esbank.",
    "Its only twenty miles away.",
    "Write and ask\nher to come over and lunch here.",
    "May 5th.",
    "Mrs.",
    "Strange mlady.",
    "Audrey Strange came into the big bedroom crossed the room to the\nbig bed stooped down and kissed the old lady and sat down in the\nchair placed ready for her.",
    "Nice to see you my dear said Lady Tressilian.",
    "And nice to see\nyou said Audrey.",
    "There was a quality of intangibility about Audrey Strange.",
    "She was of\nmedium height with very small hands and feet.",
    "Her hair was ash\nblonde and there was very little colour in her face.",
    "Her eyes were set\nwide apart and were a clear pale grey.",
    "Her features were small and\nregular a straight little nose set in a small oval pale face.",
    "With such\ncolouring with a face that was pretty but not beautiful she had\nnevertheless a quality about her that could not be denied nor ignored\nand that drew your eyes to her again and again.",
    "She was a little like a\nghost but you felt at the same time that a ghost might be possessed of\nmore reality than a live human being ...\n\nShe had a singularly lovely voice soft and clear like a small silver bell.",
    "For some minutes she and the old lady talked of mutual friends and\ncurrent events.",

    "He asked the\nquestion it seemed more from politeness than because he had any\ndesire for the information.",
    "It was a manner particularly soothing to\nMary Aldin.",
    "She wanted badly to talk to someone  but she much\npreferred to talk to someone who was not too much interested.",
    "She said Well  weve got rather a difficult position.",
    "Audrey is here as\nyou probably know\n\nShe paused questioningly and Thomas Royde nodded.",
    "And Nevile and his wife also.",
    "Thomas Roydes eyebrows went up.",
    "He said after a minute or two Bit\nawkward  what\n\nYes it is.",
    "It was all Neviles idea.",
    "She paused.",
    "Royde did not speak but as though aware of some\ncurrent of disbelief issuing from him assertively It was Neviles\nidea.",
    "Why\n\nShe raised her hands for a moment from the steeringwheel.",
    "Oh some modern reaction All sensible and friends together.",
    "That\nidea.",
    "But I dont think you know its working very well.",
    "Possibly it mightnt.",
    "He added Whats the new wife like\n\nKay Goodlooking of course.",
    "Really very goodlooking.",
    "And quite\nyoung.",
    "And Neviles keen on her\n\nOh yes.",
    "Of course theyve only been married a year.",
    "Thomas Royde turned his head slowly to look at her.",
    "His mouth smiled\na little.",
    "Mary said hastily I didnt mean that exactly.",
    "Come now Mary.",
    "I think you did.",
    "Well one cant help seeing that theyve really got very little in\ncommon.",
    "Their friends for instance \n\nShe came to a stop.",
    "Royde asked He met her didnt he on the Riviera I dont know much\nabout it.",
    "Only just the bare facts that the mater wrote.",
    "Yes they met first at Cannes.",
    "Nevile was attracted but I should\nimagine hed been attracted before  in a harmless sort of way.",
    "I still\nthink myself that if hed been left to himself nothing would have come\nof it.",
    "He was fond of Audrey you know.",
    "Thomas nodded.",
    "Mary went on I dont think he wanted to break up his marriage  Im\nsure he didnt.",
    "But the girl was absolutely determined.",
    "She wouldnt\nrest until shed got him to leave his wife  and whats a man to do in\nthose circumstances It flatters him of course.",
    "Head over ears in love with him was she\n\nI suppose it may have been like that.",
    "Marys tone sounded doubtful.",
    "She met his inquiring glance with a\nflush.",
    "What a cat I am Theres a young man always hanging about  goodlooking in a gigolo kind of way  an old friend of hers  and I cant help\nwondering sometimes whether the fact that Nevile is very well off and\ndistinguished and all that didnt have something to do with it.",
    "The girl\nhadnt a penny of her own I gather.",
    "She paused looking rather ashamed.",
    "Thomas Royde merely said\nUm hum in a speculative voice.",
    "However said Mary thats probably plain cat The girl is what one\nwould call glamorous  and that probably rouses the feline instincts of\nmiddleaged spinsters.",
    "Royde.",
    "looked thoughtfully at her but his poker face showed no\nrecognisable reaction.",
    "He said after a minute or two But what\nexactly is the present trouble about\n\n\fReally you know I havent the least idea Thats whats so odd.",
    "Naturally we consulted Audrey first  and she seemed to have no\nfeeling against meeting Kay she was charming about it all.",
    "She has\nbeen charming.",
    "No one could have been nicer.",
    "Audrey of course in\neverything she does is always just right.",
    "Her manner to them both is\nperfect.",
    "Shes very reserved as you know and one never has any idea\nof what she is really thinking or feeling  but honestly I dont believe\nshe minds at all.",
    "No reason why she should said Thomas Royde.",
    "He added rather\nbelatedly After all its three years ago.",
    "Do people like Audrey forget She was very fond of Nevile.",
    "Thomas Royde shifted in his seat.",
    "Shes only thirtytwo.",
    "Got her life in front of her.",
    "Oh I know.",
    "But she did take it hard.",
    "She had quite a bad nervous\nbreakdown you know.",
    "I know.",
    "The mater wrote me.",
    "In a way said Mary I think it was good for your mother to have\nAudrey to look after.",
    "It took her mind off her own grief  about your\nbrothers death.",
    "We were so sorry about that.",
    "Yes.",
    "Poor old Adrian.",
    "Always did drive too fast.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Mary stretched out her hand as a sign she was\ntaking the turn that led down the hill to Saltcreek.",
    "Presently as they\nwere slipping down the narrow twisting road she said Thomas  you\nknow Audrey very well\n\nSo so.",
    "Havent seen much of her for the last ten years.",
    "No but you knew her as a child.",
    "She was like a sister to you and\nAdrian\n\nHe nodded.",
    "Was she  was she at all unbalanced in any way Oh I dont mean that\nquite the way it sounds.",
    "But Ive a feeling that there is something very\nwrong with her now.",
    "Shes so completely detached her poise is so\nunnaturally perfect  but I wonder sometimes what is going on behind\nthe facade.",
    "Ive a feeling now and then of some really powerful\nemotion.",
    "And I dont quite know what it is But I do feel that she isnt\nnormal.",
    "Theres something It worries me.",
    "I do know that theres an\natmosphere in the house that affects everybody.",
    "Were all nervous and\njumpy.",
    "But I dont know what it is.",
    "And sometimes Thomas it frightens\nme.",
    "Frightens you His slow wondering tone made her pull herself\ntogether with a little nervous laugh.",
    "It sounds absurd ...",
    "But thats what I meant just now  your arrival will\nbe good for us  create a diversion.",
    "Ah here we are.",
    "They had slipped round the last corner.",
    "Gulls Point was built on a\nplateau of rock overlooking the river.",
    "On two sides it had sheer cliff\ngoing down to the water.",
    "The gardens and tennis court were on the left\nof the house.",
    "The garage a modern afterthought was actually farther\nalong the road on the other side of it.",
    "Mary said Ill put the car away now and come back.",
    "Hurstall will look\nafter you.",
    "Hurstall the aged butler was greeting Thomas with the pleasure of an\nold friend.",
    "Very glad to see you Mr. Royde after all these years.",
    "And so will her\nladyship be.",
    "Youre in the east room sir.",
    "I think youll find everyone in\nthe garden unless you want to go to your room first.",
    "Thomas shook his head.",
    "He went through the drawingroom to the\nwindow which opened on to the terrace.",
    "He stood there a moment\nwatching unobserved himself.",
    "Two women were the only occupants of the terrace.",
    "One was sitting on\nthe corner of the balustrade looking out over the water.",
    "The other\nwoman was watching her.",
    "The first was Audrey  the other he knew must be Kay Strange.",
    "Kay\ndid not know she was being overlooked and she took no pains to\ndisguise her expression.",
    "Thomas Royde was not perhaps a very\nobservant man where\n\n\fwomen were concerned but he could not fail to notice that Kay\nStrange disliked Audrey Strange very much.",
    "As for Audrey she was looking out across the river and seemed\nunconscious of or indifferent to the others presence.",
    "It was seven years since Thomas had seen Audrey Strange.",
    "He studied\nher now very carefully.",
    "Had she changed and if so in what way\n\nThere was a change he decided.",
    "She was thinner paler altogether\nmore ethereallooking  but there was something else something he\ncould not quite define.",
    "It was as though she were holding herself\ntightly in leash watchful over every movement  and yet all the time\nintensely aware of everything going on round her.",
    "She was like a\nperson he thought who had a secret to hide.",
    "But what secret He\nknew a little of the events that had befallen her in the last few years.",
    "He had been prepared for lines of sorrow and loss  but this was\nsomething else.",
    "She was like a child who by a tightly clenched hand\nover a treasure calls attention to what it wants to hide.",
    "And then his eyes went to the other woman  the girl who was now\nNevile Stranges wife.",
    "Beautiful yes.",
    "Mary Aldin had been right.",
    "He\nrather fancied dangerous too.",
    "He thought I wouldnt like to trust her\nnear Audrey if she had a knife in her hand ... And yet why should she\nhate Neviles first wife All that was over and done with.",
    "Audrey had no\npart or parcel in their lives nowadays.",
    "Footsteps rang out on the terrace as Nevile came round the corner of\nthe house.",
    "He looked warm and was carrying a picture paper.",
    "Heres\nthe Illustrated Review he said.",
    "Couldnt get the other \n\n\fThen two things happened at precisely the same minute.",
    "Kay said Oh good give it to me and Audrey without moving her\nhead held out her hand almost absentmindedly.",
    "Nevile had stopped halfway between the two women.",
    "A dawn of\nembarrassment showed in his face.",
    "Before he could speak Kay said\nher voice rising with a slight note of hysteria I want it.",
    "Give it me\nGive it me Nevile\n\nAudrey Strange started turned her head withdrew her hand and\nmurmured with just the slightest air of confusion  Oh sorry.",
    "I thought\nyou were speaking to me Nevile.",
    "Thomas Royde saw the colour come up brickred in Nevile Stranges\nneck.",
    "He took three quick steps forward and held out the picture\npaper to Audrey.",
    "She said hesitating her air of embarrassment growing Oh but \n\nKay pushed back her chair with a rough movement.",
    "She stood up\nthen turning she made for the drawingroom window.",
    "Royde had no\ntime to move before she had charged into him blindly.",
    "The shock made her recoil she looked at him as he apologised.",
    "He\nsaw then why she had not seen him her eyes were brimming with\ntears  tears he fancied of anger.",
    "Hullo she said.",
    "Who are you Oh of course the man from Malaya\nYes said Thomas.",
    "Im the man from Malaya.",
    "I wish to God I was in Malaya said Kay.",
    "Anywhere but here I loathe\nthis beastly lousy house I loathe everyone in it\n\nEmotional scenes always alarmed Thomas.",
    "He regarded Kay warily\nand murmured nervously Ah  hum.",
    "Unless theyre very careful said Kay I shall kill someone Either\nNevile or that wheyfaced cat out there\n\nShe brushed past him and went out of the room banging the door.",
    "Thomas Royde stood stock still.",
    "He was not quite sure what to do next\nbut he was glad that young Mrs.",
    "Strange had gone.",
    "He stood and\nlooked at the door that she had slammed so vigorously.",
    "Something of a\ntiger cat the new Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "The window was darkened as Nevile Strange paused in the space\nbetween the trench windows.",
    "He was breathing rather fast.",
    "He greeted Thomas vaguely.",
    "Oh  er  hullo Royde didnt know youd arrived.",
    "I say have you seen\nmy wife\n\nShe passed through about a minute ago.",
    "said the other.",
    "Nevile in his turn went out through the drawingroom door.",
    "He was\nlooking annoyed.",
    "Thomas Royde went slowly through the open window.",
    "He was not a\nheavy walker.",
    "Not until he was a couple of yards away did Audrey turn\nher head.",
    "Then he saw those wideapart eyes open wider saw her lips part.",
    "She\nslipped\n\ndown from\n\nthe wall and\n\ncame towards him hands\n\noutstretched.",
    "Oh Thomas she said.",
    "Dear Thomas How glad I am youve come\n\nAs he took the two small white hands in his and bent down to her Mary\nAldin in her turn arrived at the French windows.",
    "Seeing the two on the\nterrace she checked herself watched them for a moment or two then\nslowly turned away and went back into the house.",
    "II\n\nUpstairs Nevile had found Kay in her bedroom.",
    "The only large doublebedroom in the house was Lady Tressilians.",
    "A married couple was\nalways given the two rooms with communicating door and a small\nbathroom beyond on the west side of the house.",
    "It was a small isolated\nsuite.",
    "Nevile passed through his own room and on into his wifes.",
    "Kay had\nflung herself down on her bed.",
    "Raising a tearstained face she cried\nout angrily So youve come About time too\n\n\fWhat is all this fuss about Have you gone quite crazy Kay\n\nNevile spoke quietly but there was a dent at the corner of his nostril\nthat registered restrained anger.",
    "Why did you give that Illustrated Review to her and not to me\n\nReally Kay you are a child.",
    "All this fuss about a wretched little\npicture paper.",
    "You gave it to her and not to me repeated Kay obstinately.",
    "Well why not What does it matter\n\nIt matters to me.",
    "I dont know whats wrong with you.",
    "You cant behave in this\nhysterical fashion when youre staying in other peoples houses.",
    "Dont\nyou know how to behave in public\n\nWhy did you give it to Audrey Because she wanted it.",
    "So did I\nand Im your wife.",
    "All the more reason in that case for giving it to an older woman and\none who technically is no relation.",
    "She scored off me She wanted to and she did.",
    "You were on her side\n\nYoure talking like an idiotic jealous child.",
    "For goodness sake\ncontrol yourself and try and behave properly in public\n\n\fLike she does I suppose\n\nNevile said coldly At any rate Audrey can behave like a lady.",
    "She\ndoesnt make an exhibition of herself.",
    "Shes turning you against me She hates me and shes getting her\nrevenge.",
    "Look here Kay will you stop being melodramatic and completely\nfoolish Im fed up\n\nThen lets go away from here Lets go tomorrow.",
    "I hate this place\nWeve only been here four days.",
    "Its quite enough Do lets go\nNevile.",
    "Now look here Kay.",
    "Ive had enough of this.",
    "We came here for a\nfortnight and Im going to stay for a fortnight.",
    "If you do said Kay youll be sorry.",
    "You and your Audrey You think\nshes wonderful\n\nI dont think Audrey is wonderful.",
    "I think shes an extremely nice and\nkindly person whom Ive treated very badly and who has been most\ngenerous and forgiving.",
    "Thats where youre wrong said Kay.",
    "She got up from the bed.",
    "Her\nfury had died down.",
    "She spoke seriously  almost soberly.",
    "Audrey hasnt forgiven you Nevile.",
    "Once or twice Ive seen her\nlooking at you ...",
    "I dont know what is going on in her mind but\nsomething is ... Shes the kind that doesnt let anyone know what\ntheyre thinking.",
    "Its a pity said Nevile that there arent more people like that.",
    "Kays face went very white.",
    "Do you mean that for me There was a dangerous edge to her voice.",
    "Well  you havent shown much reticence have you Every bit of illtemper and spite that comes into your mind you blurt straight out.",
    "You\nmake a fool of yourself and you make a fool of me\n\nAnything more to say Her voice was icy.",
    "He said in an equally cold tone Im sorry if you think that was unfair.",
    "But its the plain truth.",
    "Youve no more selfcontrol than a child.",
    "You never lose your temper do you Always the selfcontrolled\ncharmingmannered little pukka sahib I dont believe youve got any\nfeelings.",
    "Youre just a fish  a damned coldblooded fish Why dont you\nlet yourself go now and then Why dont you shout at me swear at me\ntell me to go to Hell\n\nNevile sighed.",
    "His shoulders sagged.",
    "Oh Lord he said.",
    "Turning on his heel he left the room.",
    "III\n\nYou look exactly as you did at seventeen Thomas Royde said Lady\nTressilian.",
    "Just the same owlish look.",
    "And no more conversation now\nthan you had then.",
    "Why not\n\nThomas said vaguely I dunno.",
    "Never had the gift of the gab.",
    "Not like\nAdrian.",
    "Adrian was a very clever and witty talker.",
    "Perhaps thats\nwhy.",
    "Always left the talking to him.",
    "Poor Adrian.",
    "So much promise.",
    "Thomas nodded.",
    "Lady Tressilian changed the subject.",
    "She was granting an audience to\nThomas.",
    "She usually preferred her visitors one at a time.",
    "It did not tire\nher and she was able to concentrate her attention on them.",
    "Youve been here twentyfour hours she said.",
    "What do you think of\nour Situation\n\nSituation\n\nDont look stupid.",
    "You do that deliberately.",
    "You know quite well what I\nmean.",
    "The eternal triangle which has established itself under my roof.",
    "Thomas said cautiously Seems a bit of friction.",
    "Lady Tressilian\nsmiled rather diabolically.",
    "I will confess to you Thomas I am rather enjoying myself.",
    "This came\nabout through no wish of mine  indeed I did my utmost to prevent it.",
    "Nevile was obstinate.",
    "He would insist on bringing these two together and now he is reaping what he has sown\n\nThomas Royde shifted a little in his chair.",
    "Seems funny he said.",
    "Elucidate snapped Lady Tressilian.",
    "Shouldnt have thought Strange was that kind of chap.",
    "Its interesting your saying that.",
    "Because it is what I felt.",
    "It was\nuncharacteristic of Nevile.",
    "Nevile like most men is usually anxious to\navoid any kind of embarrassment or possible unpleasantness.",
    "I\nsuspected that it wasnt originally Neviles idea  but if not I dont see\nwhose idea it can have been.",
    "She paused and said with only the\nslightest upward inflexion It wouldnt be Audreys\n\nThomas said promptly No not Audreys.",
    "And I can hardly believe it was that unfortunate young woman Kays\nidea.",
    "Not unless she is a really remarkable actress.",
    "You know I have\nalmost felt sorry for her lately.",
    "You dont like her much do you\n\nNo.",
    "She seems to me emptyheaded and lacking in any kind of poise.",
    "But as I say I do begin to feel sorry for her.",
    "She is blundering about\nlike a daddylonglegs in lamplight.",
    "She has no idea of what weapons\n\n\fto use.",
    "Bad temper bad manners childish rudeness  all things which\nhave a most unfortunateeffect upon a man like Nevile.",
    "Thomas said quietly I think Audrey is the one who is in a difficult\nposition.",
    "Lady Tressilian gave him a sharp glance.",
    "Youve always been in love with Audrey havent you Thomas\n\nHis reply was quite imperturbable.",
    "Suppose I have.",
    "Practically from the time you were children together\n\nHe nodded.",
    "And then Nevile came along and carried her off from under your\nnose\n\nHe moved uneasily in his chair.",
    "Oh well I always knew I hadnt a chance.",
    "Defeatist said Lady Tressilian.",
    "I always have been a dull dog.",
    "Dobbin\n\nGood old Thomas  thats what Audrey feels about me.",
    "\u2018True Thomas said Lady Tressilian.",
    "That was your nickname\nwasnt it\n\nHe smiled as the words brought back memories of childish days.",
    "Funny I havent heard that for years.",
    "It might stand you in good stead now said Lady Tressilian.",
    "She met\nhis glance clearly and deliberately.",
    "Fidelity she said is a quality that anyone who has been through\nAudreys experience might appreciate.",
    "The doglike devotion of a\nlifetime Thomas does sometimes get its reward.",
    "Thomas Royde looked down his fingers fumbled with a pipe.",
    "That he said is what I came home hoping.",
    "IV\n\nSo here we all are said Mary Aldin.",
    "Hurstall the old butler wiped his forehead.",
    "When he went into the\nkitchen Mrs. Spicer the cook remarked upon his expression.",
    "I dont think I can be well and thats the truth said Hurstall.",
    "If I can\nso express myself everything thats said and done in this house lately\nseems to me to mean something thats different from what it sounds\nlike  if you know what I mean.",
    "Mrs. Spicer did not seem to know what he meant so Hurstall went on\nMiss Aldin now as they all sat down to dinner  she says So here we\nall are  and just that gave me a turn Made me think of a trainer whos\ngot a lot of wild animals into a cage and then the cage door shuts.",
    "I\nfelt all of a sudden as though we were all caught in a trap.",
    "Lor Mr. Hurstall said Mrs. Spicer you must have eaten something\nthats disagreed.",
    "Its not my digestion.",
    "Its the way everyones strung up.",
    "The front door\nbanged just now and Mrs.",
    "Strange  our Mrs.",
    "Strange Miss Audrey she jumped as though she had been shot.",
    "And theres the silences\ntoo.",
    "Very queer they are.",
    "Its as though all of a sudden everybodys\nafraid to speak.",
    "And then they all break out at once just saying the\nthings that first come into their heads.",
    "Enough to make anyone embarrassed said Mrs. Spicer.",
    "Two Mrs.\nStranges in the house.",
    "What I feel is it isnt decent.",
    "In the diningroom one of those silences that Hurstall had described\nwas proceeding.",
    "It was with quite an effort that Mary Aldin turned to Kay and said I\nasked your friend Mr. Latimer to dine tomorrow night\n\nOh good said Kay.",
    "Nevile said Latimer Is he down here\n\nHes staying at the Easterhead Bay Hotel said Kay.",
    "Nevile said We might go over and dine there one night.",
    "How late does\nthe ferry go\n\nUntil halfpast one said Mary.",
    "I suppose they dance there in the\nevenings Most of the people are about a hundred said Kay.",
    "Not\nvery amusing for your friend said Nevile to Kay.",
    "Mary said quickly We might go over and bathe one day at Easterhead\nBay.",
    "Its quite warm still and its a lovely sandy beach.",
    "Thomas Royde said in a low voice to Audrey I thought of going out\nsailing tomorrow.",
    "Will you come\n\nId like to.",
    "We might all go sailing said Nevile.",
    "I thought you said you were going to play golf said Kay.",
    "I did think of going over to the links.",
    "I was right off my wooden shots\nthe other day.",
    "What a tragedy said Kay.",
    "Nevile said goodhumouredly Golfs a tragic game.",
    "Mary asked Kay if she played.",
    "Yes  after a fashion.",
    "Nevile said Kay would be very good if she took a little trouble.",
    "Shes\ngot a natural swing.",
    "Kay said to Audrey You dont play any games do you\n\n\u2018\u2018Not really.",
    "I play tennis after a fashion  but Im a complete rabbit.",
    "Do you still play the piano Audrey asked Thomas.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "Not nowadays.",
    "You used to play rather well said Nevile.",
    "I thought you didnt like music Nevile said Kay.",
    "I dont know much about it said Nevile vaguely.",
    "I always wondered\nhow Audrey managed to stretch an octave her hands are so small.",
    "He was looking at them as she laid down her dessert knife and fork.",
    "She flushed a little and said quickly Ive got a very long little finger.",
    "I\nexpect that helps.",
    "You must be selfish then said Kay.",
    "If youre unselfish you have a\nshort little finger.",
    "Is that true asked Mary Aldin.",
    "Then I must be unselfish.",
    "Look my\nlittle fingers are quite short.",
    "I think you are very unselfish said Thomas Royde eyeing her\nthoughtfully.",
    "She went red  and continued quickly Whos the most unselfish of\nus Lets compare little fingers.",
    "Mine are shorter than yours Kay.",
    "But\nThomas I think beats me.",
    "I beat you both said Nevile.",
    "Look.",
    "He stretched out a hand.",
    "Only one hand though said Kay.",
    "Your lefthand little finger is short\nbut your righthand one is much finger.",
    "And your left hand is what you\nare born with and the right hand is what you make of your life.",
    "So that\nmeans that you were born unselfish and have become more selfish as\ntime goes on.",
    "Can you tell fortunes Kay asked Mary Aldin.",
    "She stretched out her\nhand palm upward.",
    "A fortuneteller told me I should have two\nhusbands and three children.",
    "I shall have to hurry up\n\nKay said Those little crosses arent children theyre journeys.",
    "That\nmeans youll take three journeys across water.",
    "That seems unlikely too said Mary Aldin.",
    "Thomas Royde asked her Have you travelled much\n\nNo hardly at all.",
    "He heard an undercurrent of regret in her voice.",
    "You would like to\n\nAbove everything.",
    "He thought in his slow reflective way of her life.",
    "Always in attendance\non an old woman.",
    "Calm tactful an excellent manager.",
    "He asked\ncuriously Have you lived with Lady Tressilian long\n\nFor nearly fifteen years.",
    "I came to be with her after my father died.",
    "He\nhad been a helpless invalid for some years before his death.",
    "And then answering the question she felt to be in his mind Im thirtysix.",
    "Thats what you wanted to know wasnt it\n\nI did wonder he admitted.",
    "You might be  any age you see.",
    "Thats rather a twoedged remark\n\nI suppose it is.",
    "I didnt mean it that way.",
    "That sombre thoughtful gaze of his did not leave her face.",
    "She did not\nfind it embarrassing.",
    "It was too free from selfconsciousness for that a genuine thoughtful interest.",
    "Seeing his eyes on her hair she put up\nher hand to the one white lock.",
    "Ive had that she said since I was very young.",
    "I like it said\nThomas Royde simply.",
    "He went on looking at her.",
    "She said at last in a slightly amused tone of\nvoice Well what is the verdict\n\nHe reddened under his tan.",
    "Oh I suppose it is rude of me to stare.",
    "I was wondering about you what you are really like.",
    "Please she said hurriedly and rose from the table.",
    "She said as she\nwent into the drawingroom with her arm through Audreys Old Mr.\nTreves is coming to dinner tomorrow too.",
    "Whos he asked Nevile.",
    "He brought an introduction from the Rufus Lords.",
    "A delightful old\ngentleman.",
    "Hes staying at the Balmoral Court.",
    "Hes got a weak heart\nand looks very frail but his faculties are perfect and he has known a\nlot of interesting people.",
    "He was a solicitor or a barrister I forget\nwhich.",
    "Everybody down here is terribly old said Kay discontentedly.",
    "She was standing just under a tall lamp.",
    "Thomas was looking that way\nand he gave her that same slow interested attention that he gave to\nanything that was immediately occupying his line of vision.",
    "He was struck suddenly with her intense and passionate beauty.",
    "A\nbeauty of vivid colouring of abundant and triumphant vitality.",
    "He\n\n\flooked across from her to Audrey pale and mothlike in a silvery grey\ndress.",
    "He smiled to himself and murmured Rose Red and Snow White.",
    "What It was Mary Aldin at his elbow.",
    "He repeated the words.",
    "Like the old fairy story you know \n\nMary Aldin said Its a very good description \n\nV\n\nMr. Treves sipped his glass of port appreciatively.",
    "A very nice wine.",
    "A\nvery nice wine.",
    "And an excellently cooked and served dinner.",
    "Clearly\nLady Tressilian had no difficulties with her servants.",
    "The house was well managed too in spite of the mistress of it being an\ninvalid.",
    "A pity perhaps that the ladies did not leave the diningroom when the\nport went round.",
    "He preferred the oldfashioned routine  But these\nyoung people had their own ways.",
    "His eyes rested thoughtfully on that brilliant and beautiful young\nwoman who was the wife of Nevile Strange.",
    "It was Kays night tonight.",
    "Her vivid beauty glowed and shone in the\ncandlelit room.",
    "Beside her Ted Latimers sleek dark head bent to hers.",
    "He was playing up to her.",
    "She felt triumphant and sure of herself.",
    "The mere sight of such radiant vitality warmed Mr. Treves old bones.",
    "Youth  there was really nothing like youth\n\nNo wonder the husband had lost his head and left his first wife.",
    "Audrey\nwas sitting next to him.",
    "A charming creature and a lady  but then that\nwas the kind of woman who invariably did get left in Mr. Treves\nexperience.",
    "He glanced at her.",
    "Her head was bent down and she was staring at her\nplate.",
    "Something in the complete immobility of her attitude struck Mr.\nTreves.",
    "He looked at her more keenly.",
    "He wondered what she was\nthinking about.",
    "Charming the way the hair sprang up from that small\nshelllike ear ...\n\nWith a little start Mr. Treves came to himself as he realised that a\nmove was being made.",
    "He got hurriedly to his feet.",
    "In the drawingroom Kay Strange went straight to the gramophone and\nput on a record of dance music.",
    "Mary Aldin said apologetically to Mr. Treves Im sure you hate jazz.",
    "Not at all said Mr. Treves untruly but politely.",
    "Later perhaps we might have some bridge she suggested.",
    "But it\nis no good starting a rubber now as I know Lady Tressilian is looking\nforward to having a chat with you.",
    "That will be delightful.",
    "Lady Tressilian never joins you down here\n\n\fNo she used to come down in an invalid chair.",
    "That is why we had a\nlift put in.",
    "But nowadays she prefers her own room.",
    "There she can talk\nto whomsoever she likes summoning them by a kind of Royal\nCommand.",
    "Very aptly put.",
    "Miss Aldin.",
    "I am always sensible of the Royal touch in\nLady Tressilians manner.",
    "In the middle of the room Kay was moving in a slow dance step.",
    "She said Just take that table out of the way Nevile.",
    "Her voice was autocratic assured.",
    "Her eyes were shining her lips\nparted.",
    "Nevile obediently moved the table.",
    "Then be took a step towards her\nbut she turned deliberately towards Ted Latimer.",
    "Come on Ted lets dance.",
    "Teds arm went round her immediately.",
    "They danced swaying\nbending their steps perfectly together.",
    "It was a lovely performance to\nwatch.",
    "Mr. Treves murmured Er  quite professional.",
    "Mary Aldin winced slightly at the word  yet surely Mr. Treves had\nspoken in simple admiration.",
    "She looked at his little wise nutcracker\nface.",
    "It bore she thought an absentminded look as though he were\nfollowing some train of thought of his own.",
    "Nevile stood hesitating a moment then he walked to where Audrey\nwas standing by the window.",
    "Dance Audrey\n\nHis tone was formal almost cold.",
    "Mere politeness you might have\nsaid inspired his request.",
    "Audrey Strange hesitated a minute before\nnodding her head and taking a step towards him.",
    "Mary Aldin made some commonplace remarks to which Mr. Treves did\nnot reply.",
    "He had so far shown no signs of deafness and his courtesy\nwas punctilious  she realised that it was absorption that held him\naloof.",
    "She could not quite make out if he was watching the dancers or\nwas staring across the room at Thomas Royde standing alone at the\nother end.",
    "With a little start Mr. Treves said Excuse me my dear lady you were\nsaying\n\nNothing.",
    "Only that it was an unusually fine September.",
    "Yes indeed  rain is badly needed locally so they tell me at my hotel.",
    "You are comfortable there I hope\n\nOh yes though I must say I was vexed when I arrived to find \n\nMr. Treves broke off.",
    "Audrey had disengaged herself from Nevile.",
    "She said with an\napologetic little laugh Its really too hot to dance.",
    "She went towards the open window and out on to the terrace.",
    "Oh Go after her you fool murmured Mary.",
    "She meant the remark to\nbe under her breath but it was loud enough for Mr. Treves to turn and\nstare at her in astonishment.",
    "She reddened and gave an embarrassed laugh.",
    "Im speaking my\nthoughts aloud she said ruefully.",
    "But really he does irritate me so.",
    "Hes so slow.",
    "Mr.",
    "Strange Oh no not Nevile.",
    "Thomas Royde.",
    "Thomas Royde was just preparing to move forward but by now Nevile\nafter a moments pause had followed Audrey out of the window.",
    "For a moment Mr. Treves eye interestedly speculative rested on the\nwindow then his attention returned to the dancers.",
    "A beautiful dancer young Mr.  Latimer did you say the name was\n\nYes.",
    "Edward Latimer.",
    "Ah yes Edward Latimer.",
    "An old friend I gather of Mrs.",
    "Strange\n\nYes.",
    "And what does this very  er  decorative young gentleman do for a\nliving\n\n\fWell really I dont quite know.",
    "Indeed said Mr. Treves managing to put a good deal of\ncomprehension into one harmless word.",
    "Mary went on He is staying at the Easterhead Bay Hotel.",
    "A very\npleasant situation said Mr. Treves.",
    "He added dreamily after a moment or two Rather as interesting\nshaped head a curious angle from the crown to the neck  rendered\nless noticeable by the way he has his hair cut but distinctly unusual.",
    "After another pause he went on still more dreamily The last man I\nsaw with a head like that got ten years penal servitude for a brutal\nattack on an elderly jeweller.",
    "Surely exclaimed Mary you dont mean \n\nNot at all not at all said Mr. Treves.",
    "You mistake me entirely.",
    "I am\nsuggesting no disparagement of a guest of yours.",
    "I was merely\npointing out that a hardened and brutal criminal can be in appearance\na most charming and personable young man.",
    "Odd but so it is.",
    "He smiled gently at her.",
    "Mary said You know Mr. Treves I think I am\na little frightened of you.",
    "Nonsense dear lady.",
    "But I am.",
    "You are  such a very shrewd observer.",
    "My eyes said Mr. Treves complacently are as good as ever they\nwere.",
    "He paused and added Whether that is fortunate or\nunfortunate I cannot at the moment decide.",
    "How could it be unfortunate\n\nMr. Treves shook his head doubtfully.",
    "One is sometimes placed in a position of responsibility.",
    "The right\ncourse of action is not always easy to determine.",
    "Hurstall entered bearing the coffee tray.",
    "After taking it to Mary and the old lawyer he went down the room to\nThomas Royde.",
    "Then by Marys directions he put the tray on a low\ntable and left the room.",
    "Kay called over Teds shoulder Well finish out this tune.",
    "Mary said\nIll take Audreys out to her.",
    "She went to the trench windows cup in hand.",
    "Mr. Treves accompanied\nher.",
    "As she paused on the threshold he looked out over her shoulder.",
    "Audrey was sitting on the corner of the balustrade.",
    "In the bright\nmoonlight her beauty came to life  a beauty born of line rather than\ncolour.",
    "The exquisite line from the jaw to the ear the tender modelling\nof chin and mouth and the really lovely bones of the head and the\nsmall straight nose.",
    "That beauty would be there when Audrey Strange\nwas an old woman  it had nothing to do with the covering flesh  it was\nthe bones themselves that were beautiful.",
    "The sequinned dress she\n\n\fwore accentuated the effect of the moonlight.",
    "She sat very still and\nNevile Strange stood and looked at her.",
    "Nevile took a step towards her.",
    "Audrey he said you \n\nShe shifted her position then sprang lightly to her feet and clapped a\nhand to her ear Oh my earring I must have dropped it\n\nWhere Let me look \n\nThey both bent down awkward and embarrassed  and collided in\ndoing so.",
    "Audrey sprang away.",
    "Nevile exclaimed  Wait a sec  my cuff\nbutton  its caught in your hair.",
    "Standstill.",
    "She stood quite still as he fumbled with the button.",
    "Oo  youre pulling it out by the roots  how clumsy you are Nevile do\nbe\n\nquick.",
    "Sorry I I seem to be all thumbs.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe moonlight was bright enough for the two onlookers to see what\nAudrey could not see the trembling of Neviles hands as he strove to\nfree the strand of fair silvery hair.",
    "But Audrey herself was trembling too  as though suddenly cold.",
    "Mary Aldin jumped as a quiet voice said behind her Excuse me \n\n\fThomas Royde passed between them and out.",
    "Shall I do that Strange he asked.",
    "Nevile straightened up and he and Audrey moved apart.",
    "Its all right.",
    "Ive done it.",
    "Neviles face was rather white.",
    "Youre cold said Thomas to Audrey.",
    "Come in and have coffee.",
    "She came back with him and Nevile turned away staring out to sea.",
    "I was bringing it out to you said Mary.",
    "But perhaps youd better\ncome in.",
    "Yes said Audrey I think Id better come in.",
    "They all went back into the drawingroom.",
    "Ted and Kay had stopped\ndancing.",
    "The door opened and a tall gaunt woman dressed in black came in.",
    "She said respectfully Her ladyships compliments and she would be\nglad to see Mr. Treves up in her room.",
    "VI\n\nLady Tressilian received Mr. Treves with evident pleasure.",
    "He and she were soon deep in an agreeable flood of reminiscences\nand a recalling of mutual acquaintances.",
    "At the end of half an hour Lady Tressilian gave a deep sigh of\nsatisfaction.",
    "Ah she said Ive enjoyed myself Theres nothing like exchanging\ngossip and remembering old scandals.",
    "A little malice agreed Mr. Treves adds a certain savour to life.",
    "By the way said Lady Tressilian what do you dunk of our example\nof the eternal triangle\n\nMr. Treves looked discreetly blank.",
    "Er  what triangle\n\nDont tell me you havent noticed it Nevile and his wives.",
    "Oh that The present Mrs.",
    "Strange is a singularly attractive young\nwoman.",
    "So is Audrey said Lady Tressilian.",
    "Mr. Treves admitted  She has charm  yes.",
    "Lady Tressilian exclaimed Do you mean to tell me you can\nunderstand a man leaving Audrey who is a  a person of rare quality\nfor  for a Kay\n\n\fMr. Treves replied calmly Perfectly.",
    "It happens frequently.",
    "Disgusting.",
    "I should soon grow tired of Kay if I were a man and wish I\nhad never made such a fool of myself\n\nThat also happens frequently.",
    "These sudden passionate infatuations\nsaid Mr. Treves looking very passionless and precise himself are\nseldom of long duration.",
    "And then what happens demanded Lady Tressilian.",
    "Usually said Mr. Treves the  er  parties adjust themselves.",
    "Quite\noften there is a second divorce.",
    "The man then marries a third party someone of a sympathetic nature.",
    "Nonsense Nevile isnt a Mormon  whatever some of your clients may\nbe\n\nThe remarriage of the original parties occasionally takes place.",
    "Lady Tressilian shook her head.",
    "That no Audrey has too much pride.",
    "You think so\n\nI am sure of it.",
    "Do not shake your head in that aggravating fashion\n\n\fIt has been my experience said Mr. Treves that women possess\nlittle or no pride where love affairs are concerned.",
    "Pride is a quality\noften on their lips but not apparent in their actions.",
    "You dont understand Audrey.",
    "She was violently in love with Nevile.",
    "Too much so perhaps.",
    "After he left her for this girl though I dont\nblame him entirely  the girl pursued him everywhere and you know\nwhat men are she never wanted to see him again.",
    "Mr. Treves coughed gently.",
    "And yet he said she is here\n\nOh well said Lady Tressilian annoyed.",
    "I dont profess to\nunderstand these modern ideas.",
    "I imagine that Audrey is here just to\nshow that she doesnt care and that it doesnt matter\n\nVery likely.",
    "Mr. Treves stroked his jaw.",
    "She can put it to herself that\nway certainly.",
    "You mean said Lady Tressilian that you think she is still hankering\nafter Nevile and that  oh no I wont believe such a thing\n\nIt could be said Mr. Treves.",
    "I wont have it said Lady Tressilian.",
    "I wont have it in my house.",
    "You are already disturbed are you not asked Mr. Treves shrewdly.",
    "There is tension.",
    "I have felt it in the atmosphere.",
    "So you feel it too said Lady Tressilian sharply.",
    "Yes I am puzzled I must confess.",
    "The true feelings of the parties\nremain obscure but in my opinion there is gunpowder about.",
    "The\nexplosion may come any minute.",
    "Stop talking like Guy Fawkes and tell me what to do said Lady\nTressilian.",
    "Mr. Treves held up his hands.",
    "Really I am at a loss to know what to suggest.",
    "There is I feel sure a\nfocalpoint.",
    "If we could isolate that  but there is so much that remains\nobscure.",
    "I have no intention of asking Audrey to leave said Lady Tressilian.",
    "As far as my observation goes she has behaved perfectly in a very\ndifficult situation.",
    "She has been courteous but aloof.",
    "I consider her\nconduct irreproachable.",
    "Oh quite said Mr. Treves.",
    "Quite.",
    "But its having a most marked\neffect on young Nevile Strange all the same.",
    "Nevile said Lady Tressilian is not behaving well.",
    "I shall speak to\nhim about it.",
    "But I couldnt turn him out of the house for a moment.",
    "Matthew regarded him as practically his adopted son.",
    "I know.",
    "Lady Tressilian sighed.",
    "She said in a lowered voice You know that\nMatthew was drowned here\n\nYes.",
    "So many people have been surprised at my remaining here.",
    "Stupid of\nthem.",
    "I have always felt Matthew near to me here.",
    "The whole house is\nfull of him.",
    "I\n\nshould feel lonely and strange anywhere else.",
    "She paused and went\non.",
    "I hoped at first that it might not be very long before I joined him.",
    "Especially when my health began to fail.",
    "But it seems I am one of these\ncreaking gates  these perpetual invalids who never die.",
    "She thumped\nher pillow angrily.",
    "It doesnt please me I can tell you I always hoped that when my time\ncame it would come quickly  that I should meet Death face to face not feel him gradually creeping along behind me always at my\nshoulder  gradually forcing me to sink to one indignity after another of\nillness.",
    "Increasing helplessness increasing dependence on other\npeople\n\nBut very devoted people I am sure.",
    "You have a faithful maid\n\nBarrett The one who brought you up.",
    "The comfort of my life A grim\nold battleaxe absolutely devoted.",
    "Shes been with me for years.",
    "And you are lucky I should say in having Miss Aldin.",
    "You are right.",
    "I am lucky in having Mary.",
    "She is a relation\n\nA distant cousin.",
    "One of those selfless creatures whose lives are\ncontinually being sacrificed to those of other people.",
    "She looked after\nher father  a clever man  but terribly exacting.",
    "When he died I begged\nher to make her home with me and I have blessed the day she came to\nme.",
    "Youve no idea what horrors most companions are.",
    "Futile boring\n\n\fcreatures.",
    "Driving one mad with their inanity.",
    "They are companions\nbecause they are fit for nothing better.",
    "To have Mary who is a wellread intelligent woman is marvellous.",
    "She has really a firstclass\nbrain  a mans brain.",
    "She has read widely and deeply and there is\nnothing she cannot discuss.",
    "And she is as clever domestically as she\nis intellectually.",
    "She runs the house perfectly and keeps the servants\nhappy  she eliminates all quarrels and jealousies I dont know how\nshe does it  just tact I suppose.",
    "She has been with you long\n\nTwelve years  no more than that.",
    "Thirteen  fourteen  something like\nthat.",
    "She has been a great comfort.",
    "Mr. Treves nodded.",
    "Lady Tressilian watching him through halfclosed lids said suddenly\nWhats the matter Youre worried about something\n\nA trifle said Mr. Treves.",
    "A mere trifle.",
    "Your eyes are sharp.",
    "I like studying people said Lady Tressilian.",
    "I always knew at once if\nthere was anything on Matthews mind.",
    "She sighed and leaned back\non her pillows.",
    "I must say good night to you now  it was a Queens\ndismissal nothing discourteous about it  I am very tired.",
    "But it has\nbeen a great great pleasure.",
    "Come and see me again soon.",
    "You may depend upon my taking advantage of those kind words.",
    "I\nonly hope I have not talked too long.",
    "Oh no.",
    "I always tire very suddenly.",
    "Ring my bell for me will you\nbefore you go\n\nMr. Treves pulled gingerly at a large oldfashioned bellpull that ended\nin a huge tassel.",
    "Quite a survival he remarked.",
    "My bell Yes.",
    "No newfangled electric bells for me.",
    "Half of the time\ntheyre out of order and you go on pressing away This thing never\nfails.",
    "It rings in Barretts room upstairs  the bell hangs over her bed.",
    "So theres never any delay in answering it.",
    "If there is I pull it again\npretty quickly.",
    "As Mr. Treves went out of the room he heard the bell pulled a second\ntime and heard the tinkle of it somewhere above his head.",
    "He looked\nup and noticed the wires that ran along the ceiling.",
    "Barrett came\nhurriedly down a flight of stairs and passed him going to her mistress.",
    "Mr. Treves went slowly downstairs not troubling with the little lift on\nthe downward journey.",
    "His face was drawn into a frown of uncertainty.",
    "He found the whole party assembled in the drawingroom and Mary\nAldin at once suggested bridge but Mr. Treves refused politely on the\nplea that he must very shortly be starting for home.",
    "My hotel he said is oldfashioned.",
    "They do not expect anyone to be\nout after midnight.",
    "Its a long time from that  only halfpast ten said Nevile.",
    "They dont\nlock you out I hope\n\nOh no.",
    "In fact I doubt if the door is locked at all at night.",
    "It is shut at\nnine oclock but one has only to turn the handle and walk in.",
    "People\nseem very haphazard down here but I suppose they are justified in\ntrusting to the honesty of the local people.",
    "Certainly no one locks their door in the daytime here said Mary.",
    "Ours stands wide open all day long  but we do lock it up at night.",
    "Whats the Balmoral Court like asked Ted Latimer.",
    "It looks a queer\nhigh Victorian atrocity of a building.",
    "It lives up to its name said Mr. Treves.",
    "And has good solid Victorian\ncomfort.",
    "Good beds good cooking  roomy Victorian wardrobes.",
    "Immense baths with mahogany surrounds.",
    "Werent you saying you were annoyed about something at first\nasked Mary.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "I had carefully reserved by letter two rooms on the ground\nfloor.",
    "I have a weak heart you know and stairs are forbidden me.",
    "When I arrived I was vexed to find the rooms were not available.",
    "Instead I was allotted two rooms very pleasant rooms I must admit\non the top floor.",
    "I protested but it seems that an old resident who had\nbeen going to Scotland this month was ill and had been unable to\nvacate the rooms.",
    "Mr. Lucan I expect said Mary.",
    "I believe that is the name.",
    "Under the circumstances I had to make the\nbest of things.",
    "Fortunately there is a good automatic lift  so that I\nhave really suffered no inconvenience.",
    "Kay said Ted why dont you come and stay at the Balmoral Court\nYoud be much more accessible.",
    "Oh I dont think it looks my kind of place.",
    "Quite right Mr. Latimer said Mr. Treves.",
    "It would not be at all in\nyour line of country.",
    "For some reason or other Ted Latimer flushed.",
    "I dont know what you\nmean by that he said.",
    "Mary Aldin sensing constraint hurriedly made a remark about a\nnewspaper sensation of the moment.",
    "I see theyve detained a man in the Kentish Town trunk case   she\nsaid.",
    "Its the second man theyve detained said Nevile.",
    "I hope theyve got\nthe right one this time.",
    "They may not be able to hold him even if he is said Mr. Treves.",
    "Insufficient evidence asked Royde.",
    "Yes said Kay I suppose they always get the evidence in the end.",
    "Not always Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "Youd be surprised if you knew how many\nof the people who have committed crimes are walking about the\ncountry free and unmolested.",
    "Because theyve never been found out you mean\n\nNot that only.",
    "There is a man  he mentioned a celebrated case of\ntwo years back  the police know who committed those child murders\n know it without a shadow of doubt  but they are powerless.",
    "That man\nhas been given an alibi by two people and though that alibi is false\nthere is no proving it to be so.",
    "Therefore the murderer goes free.",
    "How dreadful said Mary.",
    "Thomas Royde knocked out his pipe and said in his quiet reflective\nvoice That confirms what I have always thought  that there are times\nwhen one is justified in taking the law into ones own hands.",
    "What do you mean Mr. Royde\n\nThomas began to refill his pipe.",
    "He looked thoughtfully down at his\nhands as he spoke in jerky disconnected sentences.",
    "Suppose you knew  of a dirty piece of work  knew that the man who\ndid it isnt accountable to existing laws  that hes immune from\npunishment.",
    "Then I hold that one is justified in executing sentence\noneself.",
    "Mr. Treves said warmly A most pernicious doctrine Mr. Royde Such\nan action would be quite unjustifiable\n\n\u2018\u2018Dont see it.",
    "Im assuming you know that the facts are proved  its\njust that the law is powerless\n\nPrivate action is still not to be excused.",
    "Thomas smiled  a very\ngentle smile.",
    "I dont agree he said.",
    "If a man ought to have his neck wrung I\nwouldnt mind taking the responsibility of wringing it for him\n\nAnd in turn would render yourself liable to the laws penalties\n\nStill smiling Thomas said Id have to be careful of course ...",
    "In fact\none would have to go in for a certain amount of low cunning ...\n\nAudrey said in her clear voice Youd be found out Thomas.",
    "Matter\nof fact said Thomas I dont think I should.",
    "I knew a case once began Mr. Treves and stopped.",
    "He said\napologetically Criminology is rather a hobby of mine you know.",
    "Please go on said Kay.",
    "I have had a fairly wide experience of criminal cases said Mr.\nTreves.",
    "Only a few of them have held any real interest.",
    "Most\nmurderers have been lamentably uninteresting and very shortsighted.",
    "However I could tell you of one interesting example.",
    "Oh do said Kay  I like murders.",
    "Mr. Treves spoke slowly apparently choosing his words with great\ndeliberation and care.",
    "The case concerned a child.",
    "I will not mention that childs age or sex.",
    "The facts were as follows Two children were playing with bows and\narrows.",
    "One child sent an arrow through the other child in a vital spot\nand death resulted.",
    "There was an inquest the surviving child was\ncompletely distraught and the accident was commiserated and\nsympathy expressed for the unhappy author of the deed.",
    "He paused.",
    "Was that all asked Ted Latimer.",
    "That was all.",
    "A regrettable accident.",
    "But there is you see another\nside to the story.",
    "A farmer some time previously happened to have\npassed up a certain path in a wood nearby.",
    "There in a little clearing\nbe had noticed a child practising with a bow and arrow.",
    "He paused  to let his meaning sink in.",
    "You mean said Mary Aldin incredulously that it was not an accident\n that it was intentional\n\nI dont know said Mr. Treves.",
    "I have never known.",
    "It was stated at\nthe inquest that the children were unused to bows and arrows and in\nconsequence shot wildly and ignorantly.",
    "And that was not so\n\n\fThat in the case of one of the children was certainly not so What\ndid the farmer do said Audrey breathlessly.",
    "He did nothing.",
    "Whether he acted rightly or not I have never been\nsure.",
    "It was the future of a child that was at stake.",
    "A child he felt\nought to be given the benefit of a doubt.",
    "Audrey said But you yourself have no doubt about what really\nhappened\n\nMr. Treves said gravely Personally I am of opinion that it was a\nparticularly ingenious murder  a murder committed by a child and\nplanned down to every detail beforehand.",
    "Ted Latimer asked Was there a reason\n\nOh yes there was a motive.",
    "Childish teasings unkind words  enough\nto foment hatred.",
    "Children hate easily \n\nMary exclaimed But the deliberation of it Mr. Treves nodded.",
    "Yes the deliberation of it was bad.",
    "A child keeping that murderous\nintention in its heart quietly practising day after day and then the final\npiece of acting the awkward shooting  the catastrophe the pretence\nof grief and despair.",
    "It was all incredible  so incredible that probably it\nwould not have been believed in court.",
    "What happened to  to the child asked Kay curiously.",
    "Its name was\nchanged I believe said Mr. Treves.",
    "After the publicity of the inquest that was deemed advisable.",
    "That\nchild is a grownup person today  somewhere in the world.",
    "The\nquestion is has it still got a murderers heart\n\nHe added thoughtfully It is a long time ago but I would recognise my\nlittle murderer anywhere.",
    "Surely not objected Royde.",
    "Oh yes there was a certain physical peculiarity  well I will not dwell\non the subject.",
    "It is not a very pleasant one.",
    "I must really be on my way\nhome.",
    "He rose.",
    "Mary said You will have a drink first\n\nThe drinks were on a table at the other end of the room.",
    "Thomas\nRoyde who was near them stepped forward and took the stopper out\nof the whisky decanter.",
    "A whisky and soda Mr. Treves Latimer what about you\n\nNevile said to Audrey in a low voice Its a lovely evening.",
    "Come out\nfor a little.",
    "She had been standing by the window looking out at the moonlit\nterrace.",
    "He stepped past her and stood outside waiting.",
    "She turned\nback into the room shaking her head quickly.",
    "No Im tired.",
    "I I think Ill go to bed.",
    "She crossed the room and went out.",
    "Kay gave a wide yawn.",
    "Im sleepy too.",
    "What about you Mary\n\nYes I think so.",
    "Good night Mr. Treves.",
    "Look after Mr. Treves\nThomas.",
    "Good night.",
    "Miss Aldin.",
    "Good night Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "Well be over for lunch tomorrow Ted said Kay.",
    "We could bathe if\nits still like this.",
    "Right.",
    "Ill be looking for you.",
    "Good night.",
    "Miss Aldin.",
    "The two women left the room.",
    "Ted Latimer said agreeably to Mr. Treves Im coming your way sir.",
    "Down to the ferry so I pass the hotel.",
    "Thank you Mr. Latimer.",
    "I shall be glad of your escort.",
    "Mr. Treves although he had declared his intention of departing\nseemed in no hurry.",
    "He sipped his drink with pleasant deliberation and\ndevoted himself to the task of extracting information from Thomas\nRoyde as to the conditions of life in Malaya.",
    "Royde was monosyllabic in his answers.",
    "The everyday details of\nexistence might have been secrets of national importance from the\n\n\fdifficulty with which they were dragged from him.",
    "He seemed to be lost\nin some abstraction of his own out of which he roused himself with\ndifficulty to reply to his questioner.",
    "Ted Latimer fidgeted.",
    "He looked bored impatient anxious to be gone.",
    "Suddenly interrupting he exclaimed I nearly forgot.",
    "I brought Kay\nover some gramophone records she wanted.",
    "Theyre in the hall.",
    "Ill get\nthem.",
    "Will you tell her about them tomorrow Royde\n\nThe other man nodded.",
    "Ted left the room.",
    "That young man has a restless nature murmured Mr. Treves.",
    "Royde grunted without replying.",
    "A friend I think of Mrs. Stranges pursued the old lawyer.",
    "Of Kay Stranges said Thomas.",
    "Mr. Treves smiled.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "I meant that.",
    "He would be a friend of the first Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "Royde said emphatically No he wouldnt.",
    "Then catching the others quizzical eye he said flushing a little\nWhat I mean is\n\n\fOh I quite understand what you meant Mr. Royde.",
    "You yourself are a\nfriend of Mrs. Audrey Strange are you not\n\nThomas Royde slowly filled his pipe from his tobacco pouch.",
    "His eyes\nbent to his task he said or rather mumbled M  yes.",
    "More or less\nbrought up together.",
    "She must have been a very charming young girl\n\nThomas Royde said something that sounded like Um  yum.",
    "A little awkward having two Mrs. Stranges in the house\n\nOh yes  yes rather.",
    "A difficult position for the original Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "Thomas Roydes face flushed.",
    "Extremely difficult.",
    "Mr. Treves leaned forward.",
    "His question popped out sharply.",
    "Why did she come Mr. Royde\n\nWell I suppose  the others voice was indistinct she  didnt like to\nrefuse.",
    "To refuse whom\n\n\fRoyde shifted awkwardly.",
    "Well as a matter of fact I believe she always comes this time of year beginning of September.",
    "And Lady Tressilian asked Nevile Strange and his new wife at the\nsame time The old gentlemans voice held a nice note of polite\nincredulity.",
    "As to that I believe Nevile asked himself.",
    "He was anxious then for this  reunion\n\nRoyde shifted uneasily.",
    "He replied avoiding the others eye I\nsuppose so.",
    "Curious said Mr. Treves.",
    "Stupid sort of thing to do said Thomas Royde goaded into longer\nspeech.",
    "Somewhat embarrassing one would have thought said Mr. Treves.",
    "Oh well  people do that sort of thing nowadays said Thomas Royde\nvaguely.",
    "I wondered said Mr. Treves if it had been anybody elses idea\n\nRoyde stared.",
    "Who elses could it have been\n\n\fMr. Treves sighed.",
    "There are so many kind friends about in the world  always anxious to\narrange other peoples lives for them  to suggest courses of action\nthat are not in harmony   He broke off as Nevile Strange strolled back\nthrough the French windows.",
    "At the same moment Ted Latimer\nentered by the door from the hall.",
    "Hullo Ted what have you got there asked Nevile.",
    "Gramophone\nrecords for Kay.",
    "She asked me to bring them over.",
    "Oh did she She didnt tell me.",
    "There was just a moment of\nconstraint between the two then Nevile strolled over to the drink tray\nand helped himself to a whisky and soda.",
    "His face looked excited and\nunhappy and he was breathing deeply.",
    "Someone in Mr. Treves hearing had referred to Nevile as that lucky\nbeggar Strange  got everything in the world anyone could wish for.",
    "Yet he did not look at this moment at all a happy man.",
    "Thomas Royde with Neviles reentry seemed to feel that his duties as\nhost were over.",
    "He left the room without attempting to say good night\nand his walk was slightly more hurried than usual.",
    "It was almost an\nescape.",
    "A delightful evening said Mr. Treves politely as he set down his\nglass.",
    "Most er  instructive.",
    "Instructive Nevile raised his eyebrows slightly.",
    "Information re the Malay States suggested Ted smiling broadly.",
    "Hard work dragging answers out of Taciturn Thomas.",
    "Extraordinary fellow Royde said Nevile.",
    "I believe hes always been\nthe same.",
    "Just smokes that awful old pipe of his and listens and says\nUm and Ah occasionally and looks wise like an owl.",
    "Perhaps he thinks the more said Mr. Treves.",
    "And now I really must\ntake my leave.",
    "Come and see Lady Tressilian again soon said Nevile as he\naccompanied the two men to the hall.",
    "You cheer her up enormously.",
    "She has so few contacts now with the outside world.",
    "Shes wonderful\nisnt she\n\nYes indeed.",
    "A most stimulating conversationalist.",
    "Mr. Treves dressed himself carefully with overcoat and muffler and\nafter renewed good nights he and Ted Latimer set out together.",
    "The Balmoral Court was actually only about a hundred yards away\naround one curve of the road.",
    "It loomed up grim and forbidding the\nfirst outpost of the straggling country street.",
    "The ferry where Ted Latimer was bound was two or three hundred\nyards farther down at a point where the river was at its narrowest.",
    "Mr. Treves stopped at the door of the Balmoral Court and held out his\nhand.",
    "Good night Mr. Latimer.",
    "You are staying down here much\nlonger\n\n\fTed smiled with a flash of white teeth.",
    "That depends Mr. Treves.",
    "I\nhavent had time to be bored  yet.",
    "No  no so I should imagine.",
    "I suppose like most young people\nnowadays boredom is what you dread most in the world and yet I can\nassure you there are worse things.",
    "Such as\n\nTed Latimers voice was soft and pleasant but it held an undercurrent\nof something else  something not quite so easy to define.",
    "Oh I leave it to your imagination Mr. Latimer.",
    "I would not presume to\ngive you advice you know.",
    "The advice of such elderly fogeys as myself\nis invariably treated with scorn.",
    "Rightly so perhaps who knows But\nwe old buffers like to think that experience has taught us something.",
    "We have noticed a good deal you know in the course of a lifetime.",
    "A cloud had come over the face of the moon.",
    "The street was very\ndark.",
    "Out of the darkness a mans figure came towards them walking\nup the hill.",
    "It was Thomas Royde.",
    "Just been down to the ferry for a bit of a walk he said indistinctly\nbecause of the pipe clenched between his teeth.",
    "This your pub he asked Mr. Treves.",
    "Looks as though you were\nlocked out.",
    "Oh I dont think so said Mr. Treves.",
    "He turned the big brass doorknob and the door swung back.",
    "Well see you safely in said Royde.",
    "The three of them entered the hall.",
    "It was dimly lit with only one\nelectric light.",
    "There was no one to be seen and an odour of bygone\ndinner rather dusty velvet and good furniture met their nostrils.",
    "Suddenly Mr. Treves gave an exclamation of annoyance.",
    "On the lift in\nfront of them was a notice LIFT OUT OF ORDER\n\nDear me said Mr. Treves.",
    "How extremely vexing I shall have to\nwalk up all those stairs.",
    "Too bad said Royde.",
    "Isnt there a service lift  luggage  all that\n\nIm afraid not.",
    "This one is used for all purposes.",
    "Well I must take it\nslowly that is all.",
    "Good night to you both.",
    "He started slowly up the wide staircase.",
    "Royde and Latimer wished\nhim good night then let themselves out into the dark street.",
    "There was a moments pause then Royde said abruptly Well good\nnight.",
    "Good night.",
    "See you tomorrow.",
    "Yes.",
    "Ted Latimer strode lightly down the hill towards the ferry.",
    "Thomas\nRoyde stood looking after him for a moment then he walked slowly in\nthe opposite direction towards Gulls Point.",
    "The moon came out from behind the cloud and Saltcreek was once\nmore bathed in silvery radiance.",
    "VII\n\nJust like summer murmured Mary Aldin.",
    "She and Audrey were sitting on the beach just below the imposing\nedifice of the Easterhead Bay Hotel.",
    "Audrey wore a white swimsuit\nand looked like a delicate ivory figurine.",
    "Mary had not bathed.",
    "A little\nway along from them Kay lay on her face exposing her bronzed limbs\nand back to the sun.",
    "Ugh She sat up.",
    "The waters horribly cold she said accusingly.",
    "Oh well it is September said Mary.",
    "Its always cold in England said Kay discontentedly.",
    "How I wish we were in the South of France That really is hot.",
    "Ted Latimer from beyond her murmured This sun here isnt a real\nsun.",
    "Arent you going in at all Mr. Latimer asked Mary.",
    "Kay laughed.",
    "Ted never goes in the water.",
    "Just suns himself like a lizard.",
    "She stretched out a toe and prodded him.",
    "He sprang up.",
    "Come and walk Kay.",
    "Im cold.",
    "They went off together along the beach.",
    "Like a lizard Rather an unfortunate comparison murmured Mary\nAldin looking after them.",
    "Is that what you think of him asked Audrey.",
    "Mary Aldin frowned.",
    "Not quite.",
    "A lizard suggests something quite tame.",
    "I dont think he is\ntame.",
    "No said Audrey thoughtfully I dont think so either.",
    "How well they look together said Mary watching the retreating pair.",
    "They match somehow dont they\n\nI suppose they do.",
    "They like the same things went on Mary.",
    "And have the same\nopinions and and use the same language.",
    "What a thousand pities it is\nthat  She stopped.",
    "Audrey said sharply That what\n\nMary said slowly I suppose I was going to say what a pity it was that\nNevile and she ever met.",
    "Audrey sat up stiffly.",
    "What Mary called to herself Audreys frozen\nlook had come over her face.",
    "Mary said quickly Im sorry Audrey.",
    "I\nshouldnt have said that.",
    "Id so much rather  not talk about it if you dont mind.",
    "Of course of course.",
    "It was very stupid of me.",
    "I I hoped youd got\nover it I suppose.",
    "Audrey turned her head slowly.",
    "With a calm expressionless face she\nsaid I assure you there is nothing to get over.",
    "I I have no feeling of\nany kind in the matter.",
    "I hope I hope with all my heart that Kay and\nNevile will always be very happy together.",
    "Well thats very nice of you Audrey.",
    "It isnt nice.",
    "It is  just true.",
    "But I do think it is  well  unprofitable to\nkeep on going back over the past.",
    "Its a pity this happened  that It is\nall over now.",
    "Why rake it up Weve got to go on living our lives in the\npresent.",
    "I suppose said Mary simply that people like Kay and Ted are\nexciting to me because  well they are so different from anything or\nanyone that I have ever come across.",
    "Yes I suppose they are.",
    "Even you said Mary with sudden bitterness have lived and had\nexperiences that I shall probably never have.",
    "I know youve been\nunhappy  very unhappy but I cant help feeling that even that is better\nthan  well  nothing.",
    "Emptiness\n\nShe said the last word with a fierce emphasis.",
    "Audreys wide eyes looked a little startled.",
    "I never dreamt you ever\nfelt like that.",
    "Didnt you Mary Aldin laughed apologetically.",
    "Oh just a\nmomentary fit of discontent my dear.",
    "I didnt really mean it.",
    "It cant be very gay for you said Audrey slowly.",
    "Just living here with\nCamilla dear thing though she is.",
    "Reading to her managing the\nservants never going away.",
    "Im well fed and housed said Mary.",
    "Thousands of women arent\neven that.",
    "And really Audrey I am quite contented.",
    "I have  a smile\nplayed for a moment round her lips  my private distractions.",
    "Secret vices asked Audrey smiling also.",
    "Oh I plan things said Mary vaguely.",
    "In my mind you know.",
    "And I\nlike experimenting sometimes  upon people.",
    "Just seeing you know if\nI can make them react to what I say in the way I mean.",
    "You sound almost sadistic Mary.",
    "How little I really know you Oh\nits all quite harmless.",
    "Just a childish little amusement.",
    "Audrey asked\ncuriously Have you experimented on me\n\nNo.",
    "Youre the only person I have always found quite incalculable.",
    "I\nnever know you see what you are thinking.",
    "Perhaps said Audrey gravely that is just as well.",
    "She shivered and Mary exclaimed Youre cold.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think I will go and dress.",
    "After all it is September.",
    "Mary Aldin remained alone staring at the reflection on the water.",
    "The\ntide was going out.",
    "She stretched herself out on the sand closing her\neyes.",
    "They had had a good lunch at the hotel.",
    "It was still quite full although it\nwas past the height of the season.",
    "A queer mixedlooking lot of people.",
    "Oh well it had been a day out.",
    "Something to break the monotony of\nday following day.",
    "It had been a relief too to get away from that sense\nof tension that strungup atmosphere that there had been lately at\nGulls Point.",
    "It hadnt been Audreys fault but Nevile \n\nHer thoughts broke up abruptly as Ted Latimer plumped himself down\non the beach beside her.",
    "What have you done with Kay Mary asked.",
    "Ted replied briefly Shes been claimed by her legal owner.",
    "Something in his tone made Mary Aldin sit up.",
    "She glanced across the\nstretch of shining golden sands to where Nevile and Kay were walking\nby the waters edge.",
    "Then she glanced quickly at the man beside her.",
    "She had thought of him as nerveless as queer as dangerous even.",
    "Now for the first time she got a glimpse of someone young and hurt.",
    "She thought He was in love with Kay  really in love with her  and\nthen Nevile came and took her away....\n\nShe said gently I hope you are enjoying yourself down here.",
    "They were conventional words.",
    "Mary Aldin seldom used any words but\nconventional ones  that was her language.",
    "But her tone was an offer for the first time  of friendliness Ted Latimer responded to it.",
    "As much probably as I should enjoy myself anywhere.",
    "Mary said\nIm sorry.",
    "But you dont care a damn really Im an outsider  and what does it\nmatter what outsiders feel and think\n\nShe turned her head to look at this bitter and handsome young man.",
    "He returned her look with one of defiance.",
    "She said slowly as one who makes a discovery I see.",
    "You dont like\nus.",
    "He laughed shortly.",
    "Did you expect me to\n\nShe said thoughtfully I suppose you know that I did expect just that.",
    "One takes of course too much for granted.",
    "One should be more\nhumble.",
    "Yes it would not have occurred to me that you would not like\nus.",
    "We have tried to make you welcome  as Kays friend\n\nYes as Kays friend\n\nThe interruption came with a quick venom.",
    "Mary said with disarming sincerity I wish you would tell me  really I\nwish it just why you dislike us What have we done What is wrong\nwith us\n\nTed Latimer said with a blistering emphasis on the one word Smug\n\nSmug Mary queried it without rancour examining the charge with\njudicial appraisement.",
    "Yes she admitted.",
    "I see that we could seem like that.",
    "You are like that.",
    "You take all the good things of life for granted.",
    "Youre happy and superior in your little ropedoff enclosure shut off\nfrom the common herd.",
    "You look at people like me as though I were\none of the animals outside\n\nIm sorry said Mary.",
    "Its true isnt it\n\n\fNo not quite.",
    "We are stupid perhaps and unimaginative  but not\nmalicious.",
    "I myself am conventional and superficially I dare say what\nyou call smug.",
    "But really you know Im quite human inside.",
    "Im very\nsorry this minute because you are unhappy and I wish I could do\nsomething about it.",
    "Well  if thats so  its nice of you.",
    "There was a pause then Mary said gently Have you always been in\nlove with Kay\n\nPretty well.",
    "And she\n\nI thought so  until Strange came along.",
    "Mary said gently And youre still in love with her\n\nI should think that was obvious.",
    "After a moment or two Mary said quietly Hadnt you better go away\nfrom here\n\nWhy should I\n\nBecause you are only letting yourself in for more unhappiness.",
    "He looked at her and laughed.",
    "Youre a nice creature he said.",
    "But you dont know much about the\nanimals prowling about outside your little enclosure.",
    "Quite a lot of\nthings may happen in the near future.",
    "What sort of things said Mary sharply.",
    "He laughed.",
    "Wait and see.",
    "VIII\n\nWhen Audrey had dressed she went along the beach and out along a\njutting point of rocks joining Thomas Royde who was sitting there\nsmoking a pipe\n\nexactly opposite to Gulls Point which stood white and serene on the\nopposite side of the river.",
    "Thomas turned his head at Audreys approach but he did not move.",
    "She sat down beside him without speaking.",
    "They were silent with the\ncomfortable silence of two people who know each other very well\nindeed.",
    "How near it looks said Audrey at last breaking the silence.",
    "Thomas\nlooked across at Gulls Point.",
    "Yes we could swim home.",
    "Not at this tide.",
    "There was a housemaid Camilla had once.",
    "She was an\nenthusiastic bather used to swim across and back whenever the tide\nwas right.",
    "It has to be high or low  but when its running out it sweeps\nyou right down to the mouth of the river.",
    "It did that to her one day  only\nluckily she kept her head and came ashore all right on Easter Point only very exhausted.",
    "It doesnt say anything about its being dangerous here.",
    "It isnt this side.",
    "The current is the other side.",
    "Its deep there under\nthe cliffs.",
    "There was a wouldbe suicide last year  threw himself off\nStark Head  but he was caught by a tree halfway down the cliff and\nthe coastguards got to him all right.",
    "Poor devil said Thomas.",
    "I bet he didnt thank them.",
    "Must be\nsickening to have made up your mind to get out of it all and then be\nsaved.",
    "Makes a fellow feel a fool.",
    "Perhaps hes glad now suggested Audrey dreamily.",
    "She wondered vaguely where the man was now and what he was\ndoing.",
    "Thomas puffed away at his pipe.",
    "By turning his head very slightly he\ncould look at Audrey.",
    "He noted her grave absorbed face as she stared\nacross the water.",
    "The long brown lashes that rested on the pure line of\nthe cheek the small shelllike ear.",
    "That reminded him of something.",
    "Oh by the way Ive got your earring  the one you lost last night.",
    "His\nfingers delved into his pocket.",
    "Audrey stretched out a hand.",
    "Oh\ngood where did you find it On the terrace\n\nNo.",
    "It was near the stairs.",
    "You must have lost it as you came down to\ndinner.",
    "I noticed you hadnt got it at dinner.",
    "Im glad to have it back.",
    "She took it.",
    "Thomas reflected that it was rather a large barbaric earring for so small an ear.",
    "The ones she had on today were large too.",
    "He remarked You wear your earrings even when you bathe.",
    "Arent\nyou afraid of losing them\n\nOh these are very cheap things.",
    "I hate being without earrings\nbecause of this.",
    "She touched her left ear.",
    "Thomas remembered.",
    "Oh\nyes that time old Bouncer bit you Audrey nodded.",
    "They were silent reliving a childish memory.",
    "Audrey Standish as she\nthen was a long spindlelegged child putting her face down on old\nBouncer who had had a sore paw.",
    "A nasty bite he had given her.",
    "She\nhad had to have a stitch put in it.",
    "Not that there was much to show now\n just the tiniest little scar.",
    "My dear girl he said you can hardly see the mark.",
    "Why do you\nmind\n\nAudrey paused before answering with evident sincerity Its because because I just cant bear a blemish.",
    "Thomas nodded.",
    "It fitted in with his knowledge of Audrey  of her\ninstinct for perfection.",
    "She was in herself so perfectly finished an\narticle.",
    "He said suddenly Youre far more beautiful than Kay.",
    "She turned quickly.",
    "Oh no Thomas.",
    "Kay  Kay is really lovely.",
    "On the outside.",
    "Not underneath.",
    "Are you referring said Audrey with faint amusement to my\nbeautiful soul\n\nThomas knocked out the ashes of his pipe.",
    "No he said.",
    "I think I mean your bones.",
    "Audrey laughed.",
    "Thomas packed a new pipeful of tobacco.",
    "They were silent for quite\nfive minutes but Thomas glanced at Audrey more than once though\nhe did it so unobtrusively that she was unaware of it.",
    "He said at last quietly Whats wrong Audrey\n\nWrong What do you mean by wrong\n\nWrong with you.",
    "Theres something.",
    "No theres nothing.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "But there is.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "Wont you tell me\n\nTheres nothing to tell.",
    "I suppose Im being a chump  but Ive got to say it   He paused.",
    "Audrey cant you forget about it Cant you let it all go\n\nShe dug her small hands convulsively into the rock.",
    "You dont\nunderstand  you cant begin to understand.",
    "But Audrey my dear I\ndo.",
    "Thats just it.",
    "I know.",
    "She turned a small doubtful face to him.",
    "I know exactly what youve been through.",
    "And  and what it must have\nmeant to you.",
    "She was very white now white to the lips.",
    "I see she said.",
    "I didnt think  anyone knew.",
    "Well I do.",
    "I  Im not going to talk about it.",
    "But what I want to impress\nupon you is that its all over  its past and done with.",
    "She said in a low voice Some things dont pass.",
    "Look here Audrey its no good brooding and remembering.",
    "Granted\nyouve been through Hell.",
    "It does no good to go over and over a thing\nin your mind.",
    "Look forward  not back.",
    "Youre quite young.",
    "Youve got\nyour life to live and most of that life is in front of you.",
    "Think of tomorrow not of yesterday.",
    "She looked at him with a steady wideeyed gaze that was singularly\nunrevealing of her real thoughts.",
    "And supposing she said that I cant do that But you must.",
    "Audrey said gently I thought you didnt understand.",
    "Im  Im not quite\nnormal about  some things I suppose.",
    "He broke in roughly Rubbish.",
    "You  He stopped.",
    "I  what\n\nI was thinking of you as you were when you were a girl  before you\nmarried Nevile.",
    "Why did you marry Nevile\n\nAudrey smiled.",
    "Because I fell in love with him.",
    "Yes yes I know that.",
    "But why did you fall in love with him What\nattracted you to him so much\n\nShe crinkled her eyes as though trying to see through the eyes of a girl\nnow dead.",
    "I think she said it was because he was so positive.",
    "He was so\nmuch the opposite of what I was myself.",
    "I always felt shadowy  not\nquite real.",
    "Nevile was very real.",
    "And so happy and sure of himself and\nso  everything that I was not.",
    "She added with a smile And very\ngoodlooking.",
    "Thomas Royde said bitterly Yes the ideal Englishman  good at sport\nmodest goodlooking always the little pukka sahib  getting\neverything he wanted all along the line.",
    "Audrey sat very upright and stared at him.",
    "You hate him she said slowly.",
    "You hate him very much dont you\n\nHe avoided her eyes turning away to cup a match in his hands as he\nrelit the pipe that had gone out.",
    "Wouldnt be surprising if I did would it he said indistinctly.",

    "Dead\n\nYes isnt it terrible So sudden.",
    "Apparently he didnt even get\nundressed last night.",
    "He must have collapsed as soon as he got\nhome.",
    "Oh dear I am sorry.",
    "One knows of course that he was delicate.",
    "A weak heart.",
    "I hope\nnothing happened while he was here to overstrain it There was\nnothing indigestible for dinner\n\nI dont think so  no I am sure there wasnt.",
    "He seemed quite well and\nin good spirits.",
    "I am really very distressed.",
    "I wish Mary that you would go to the\nBalmoral Court and make a few inquiries of Mrs. Rogers.",
    "Ask her if\nthere is anything we can do.",
    "And then the funeral.",
    "For Matthews sake I\nwould like to do anything we could.",
    "These things are so awkward at a\nhotel.",
    "Mary spoke firmly.",
    "Dear Camilla you really must not worry.",
    "This has been a shock to\nyou.",
    "Indeed it has.",
    "I will go to the Balmoral Court at once and then come back and tell\nyou all about things.",
    "Thank\n\nyou\n\nMary\n\ndear\n\nyou\n\nare\n\nalways\n\nso\n\npractical\n\nand\n\nunderstanding.",
    "Please try and rest now.",

    "Good afternoon Dr. Lazenby.",
    "This is Mr. Royde.",
    "We came round with\na message from Lady Tressilian to know if there is anything we can\ndo.",
    "Thats very kind of you Miss Aldin said the hotel proprietress.",
    "Come into my room wont you\n\nThey all went into the small comfortable sittingroom and Dr. Lazenby\nsaid Mr. Treves was dining at your place last night wasnt he\n\nYes.",
    "How did he seem Did he show any signs of distress\n\nNo he seemed very well and cheerful.",
    "The doctor nodded.",
    "Yes thats the worst of these heart cases.",
    "The end is nearly always\nsudden.",
    "I had a look at his prescriptions upstairs and it seems quite\nclear that he was in a very precarious state of health.",
    "I shall\ncommunicate with his London doctor of course.",
    "He was very careful of himself always said Mrs. Rogers.",
    "And Im\nsure he had every care here we could give him.",
    "Im sure of that Mrs. Rogers said the doctor tactfully.",
    "It was just\nsome tiny additional strain no doubt.",
    "Such as walking upstairs suggested Mary.",
    "Yes that might do it.",
    "In fact almost certainly would  that is if he ever\nwalked up those three flights  but surely he never did anything of that\nkind\n\nOh no said Mrs. Rogers.",
    "He always used the lift.",
    "Always.",
    "He was\nmost particular.",
    "I mean said Mary that with the lift being out of order last night  \n\nMrs. Rogers was staring at her in surprise.",
    "But the lift wasnt out of order at all yesterday.",
    "Miss Aldin.",
    "Excuse me said Royde.",
    "I came home with Mr. Treves last night.",
    "There was a placard on the lift saying Out of order.",
    "Mrs. Rogers stared.",
    "Well thats an odd thing.",
    "Id have declared there was nothing wrong\nwith the lift  in fact Im sure there wasnt.",
    "Id have heard about it if\nthere was.",
    "We havent had anything go wrong with the lift touching\nwood since  oh not for a good eighteen months.",
    "Very reliable it is.",
    "Perhaps suggested the doctor some porter or hallboy put that\nnotice up when he was off duty\n\nIts an automatic lift doctor it doesnt need anyone to work it.",
    "Ah\nyes so it is.",
    "I was forgetting.",
    "Ill have a word with Joe said Mrs. Rogers.",
    "She bustled out of the\nroom calling Joe  Joe.",
    "Dr. Lazenby looked curiously at Thomas.",
    "Excuse me youre quite\nsure Mr.  er  Royde put in Mary.",
    "Quite sure said Thomas.",
    "Mrs. Rogers came back with the porter.",
    "Joe was emphatic that nothing\nwhatever had been wrong with the lift on the preceding night.",
    "There\nwas such a placard as Thomas had described  but it was tucked away\nunder the desk and hadnt been used for over a year.",
    "They all looked at each other and agreed it was a most mysterious\nthing.",
    "The doctor suggested some practical joke on the part of one of\nthe hotel visitors and perforce they left it at that.",
    "In reply to Marys inquiries Dr. Lazenby explained that Mr. Treves\nchauffeur had given him the address of Mr. Treves solicitors and he\nwas communicating with them and that he would come round and see\nLady Tressilian and tell her what was going to be done about the\nfuneral.",
    "Then the busy cheerful doctor hurried off and Mary and Thomas\nwalked slowly back to Gulls Point.",
    "Mary said Youre quite sure you saw that notice Thomas\n\nBoth Latimer and I saw it.",
    "What an extraordinary thing said Mary.",
    "X\n\nIt was the 12th of September.",
    "Only two more days said Mary Aldin.",
    "Then she bit her lip and flushed.",
    "Thomas Royde looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "Is that how you feel about\nit\n\nI dont know whats the matter with me said Mary.",
    "Never in all my\nlife have I been so anxious for a visit to come to an end.",
    "And usually we\nenjoy having Nevile so much.",
    "And Audrey too.",
    "Thomas nodded.",
    "But this time went on Mary one feels as though one were sitting on\ndynamite.",
    "At any minute the whole thing may explode.",
    "Thats why I said\nto myself first thing this morning Only two days more.",
    "Audrey goes\non Wednesday and Nevile and Kay on Thursday.",
    "And I go on Friday said Thomas.",
    "Oh Im not counting you.",
    "Youve been a tower of strength.",
    "I dont\nknow what I should have done without you.",
    "The human buffer\n\nMore than that.",
    "Youve been so kind and so  so calm.",
    "That sounds\nrather ridiculous but it really does express what I mean.",
    "Thomas looked pleased though slightly embarrassed.",
    "I dont know why weve all been so het up said Mary reflectively.",
    "After all if there were an  an outburst  it would be awkward and\nembarrassing but nothing more.",
    "But theres been more to your feeling than that.",
    "Oh yes there has.",
    "A definite feeling of apprehension.",
    "Even the\nservants feel it.",
    "The kitchenmaid burst into tears and gave notice this\nmorning  for no reason at all.",
    "The cooks jumpy  Hurstall is all on edge\n even Barrett who is usually as calm as a  a battleship  has shown\nsigns of nerves.",
    "And all because Nevile had this ridiculous idea of\nwanting his former and his present wife to make friends and so soothe\nhis own conscience.",
    "In which ingenious idea he has singularly failed remarked Thomas.",
    "Yes.",
    "Kay is  is getting quite beside herself.",
    "And really Thomas I\ncant help sympathising with her.",
    "She paused.",
    "Did you notice the way Nevile looked after Audrey as she\nwent up the stairs last night He still cares about her Thomas.",
    "The\nwhole thing has been the most tragic mistake.",
    "Thomas started filling his pipe.",
    "He should have thought of that before he said in a hard voice.",
    "Oh I know.",
    "Thats what one says.",
    "But it doesnt alter the fact that the\nwhole thing is a tragedy.",
    "I cant help feeling sorry for Nevile.",
    "People like Nevile  began Thomas and then stopped.",
    "Yes\n\nPeople like Nevile think they can always have everything their own\nway  and have everything they want too.",
    "I dont suppose Nevile has\never had a setback over anything in his life till he came up against this\nbusiness of Audrey.",
    "Shes out of his reach.",
    "No good his making a song\nand dance about it.",
    "Hes just got to lump it.",
    "I suppose youre quite right.",
    "But you do sound hard.",
    "Audrey was so\nmuch in love with Nevile when she married him  and they always got\non together so well.",
    "Well shes out of love with him now.",
    "I wonder murmured Mary under her breath.",
    "Thomas was going on And Ill tell you something else.",
    "Nevile had\nbetter look out for Kay.",
    "Shes a dangerous kind of young woman really dangerous.",
    "If she got her temper up shed stop at nothing.",
    "Oh dear Mary sighed and returning to her original remarks said\nhopefully Well its only two days more.",
    "Things had been very difficult for the last four or five days.",
    "The death\nof Mr. Treves had given Lady Tressilian a shock which had told\nadversely on her health.",
    "The funeral had taken place in London for\nwhich Mary was thankful since it enabled the old lady to take her mind\noff the sad event more quickly than she might have been able to do\notherwise.",
    "The domestic side of the household had been very nervy\nand difficult and Mary really felt tired and dispirited this morning.",
    "Its partly the weather she said aloud.",
    "Its unnatural.",
    "It had indeed been an unusually hot and fine spell for September.",
    "On\nseveral days the thermometer had registered 70 in the shade.",
    "Nevile strolled out of the house and joined them as she spoke.",
    "Blaming the weather he asked with a glance up at the sky.",
    "It is\nrather incredible.",
    "Hotter than ever today.",
    "And no wind.",
    "Makes one feel\njumpy somehow.",
    "However I think well get rain before very long.",
    "Today is just a bit too tropical to last.",
    "Thomas Royde had moved very gently and aimlessly away and now\ndisappeared round the corner of the house.",
    "Departure of gloomy Thomas said Nevile.",
    "Nobody could say he\nshows any enjoyment of my company.",
    "Hes rather a dear said Mary.",
    "I disagree.",
    "Narrowminded prejudiced sort of chap.",
    "He always hoped to marry Audrey I think.",
    "And then you came along\nand cut him out.",
    "It would have taken him about seven years to make up his mind to ask\nher to marry him.",
    "Did he expect the poor girl to wait about while he\nmade up his mind\n\nPerhaps said Mary deliberately it will all come right now.",
    "Nevile\nlooked at her and raised an eyebrow.",
    "True love rewarded Audrey marry that wet fish Shes a lot too good\nfor that.",
    "No I dont see Audrey marrying gloomy Thomas.",
    "I believe she is really very fond of him Nevile.",
    "What matchmakers you women always are Cant you let Audrey\nenjoy her freedom for a bit\n\nIf she does enjoy it certainly.",
    "Nevile said quickly You think shes not happy\n\nI really havent the least idea.",
    "No more have I said Nevile slowly.",
    "One never does know what\nAudrey is feeling.",
    "He paused and then added But Audrey is one\nhundred per cent thoroughbred.",
    "Shes white all through.",
    "Then he said more to himself than to Mary God what a damned fool\nIve been\n\nMary went into the house a little worried.",
    "For the third time she\nrepeated to herself the comforting words Only two days more.",
    "Nevile wandered restlessly about the garden and terraces.",
    "Right at the end of the garden he found Audrey sitting on the low wall\nlooking down at the water below.",
    "It was high tide and the river was full.",
    "She got up at once and came towards him.",
    "I was just coming back to the house.",
    "It must be nearly teatime.",
    "She spoke quickly and nervously without looking at him.",
    "He walked beside her without speaking.",
    "Only when they reached the terrace again did he say Can I talk to\nyou Audrey\n\n\fShe said at once her fingers gripping the edge of the balustrade I\nthink youd better not.",
    "That means you know what I want to say.",
    "She did not answer.",
    "What about it Audrey Cant we go back to where we were Forget\neverything that has happened\n\nIncluding Kay\n\nKay said Nevile will be sensible.",
    "What do you mean by sensible\n\nSimply this.",
    "I shall go to her and tell her the truth.",
    "Fling myself on her\ngenerosity.",
    "Tell her what is true that you are the only woman I ever\nloved.",
    "You loved Kay when you married her.",
    "My marriage to Kay was the biggest mistake I ever made.",
    "I \n\nHe stopped.",
    "Kay had come out of the drawingroom window.",
    "She\nwalked towards them and before the fury in her eyes even Nevile\nshrank a little.",
    "Sorry to interrupt this touching scene said Kay.",
    "But I think its\nabout time I did.",
    "Audrey moved away.",
    "Ill leave you alone she said.",
    "Her face and\nvoice were colourless.",
    "Thats right said Kay.",
    "Youve done all the mischief you wanted to\ndo havent you Ill deal with you later.",
    "Just now Id rather have it out\nwith Nevile.",
    "Look here Kay Audrey has absolutely nothing to do with this.",
    "Its not\nher fault.",
    "Blame me if you like \n\nAnd I do like said Kay.",
    "Her eyes blazed at Nevile.",
    "What sort of a\nman do you think you are\n\nA pretty poor sort of man said Nevile bitterly.",
    "You leave your wife come bullheaded after me get your wife to give\nyou a divorce.",
    "Crazy about me one minute tired of me the next Now I\nsuppose you want to go back to that wheyfaced mewling doublecrossing little cat \n\nStop that Kay\n\nWell what do you want\n\nNevile was very white.",
    "He said Im every kind of a worm you like to\ncall me.",
    "But its no good Kay I cant go on.",
    "I think  really I must have\nloved Audrey all the time.",
    "My love for you was  was a kind of madness.",
    "But its no good my dear you and I dont belong.",
    "I shouldnt be able to\nmake you happy in the long run.",
    "Believe me Kay its better to cut our\nlosses.",
    "Lets try and part friends.",
    "Be generous.",
    "Kay said in a deceptively quiet voice What exactly are you\nsuggesting\n\nNevile did not look at her.",
    "His chin took on a dogged angle.",
    "We can\nget a divorce.",
    "You can divorce me for desertion.",
    "Not for some time.",
    "Youll have to wait for it.",
    "Ill wait said Nevile.",
    "And then after three years or whatever it is youll ask dear sweet\nAudrey to marry you all over again\n\nIf shell have me.",
    "Shell have you all right said Kay viciously.",
    "And where do I come\nin\n\nYoull be free to find a better man than I am.",
    "Naturally I shall see\nyoure well provided for \n\nCut out the bribes Her voice rose as she lost control of herself\nListen to me Nevile.",
    "You cant do this thing to me Ill not divorce you.",
    "I married you because I loved you.",
    "I know when you started turning\nagainst me.",
    "It was after I let you know I followed you to Estoril.",
    "You\nwanted to think it was all Fate.",
    "It upset your vanity to think it was me.",
    "Well Im not ashamed of what I did.",
    "You fell in love with me and\nmarried me and Im not going to let you go back to that sly little cat\nwhos got her hooks into you again.",
    "She meant this to happen  but\nshes not going to bring it off Ill kill you first.",
    "Do you hear Ill kill you.",
    "Ill kill her too.",
    "Ill see you both dead.",
    "Ill \n\n\fNevile took a step forward and caught her by the arm.",
    "Shut up Kay.",
    "For goodness sake.",
    "You cant make this kind of scene\nhere.",
    "Cant I Youll see.",
    "Ill \n\nHurstall stepped out on the terrace.",
    "His face was quite impassive.",
    "Tea is served in the drawingroom he announced.",
    "Kay and Nevile walked slowly towards the drawingroom window.",
    "Hurstall stood aside to let them pass in.",
    "Up in the sky the clouds were\ngathering.",
    "XI\n\nThe rain started falling at a quarter to seven.",
    "Nevile watched it from\nthe window of his bedroom.",
    "He had no further conversation with Kay.",
    "They had avoided each other after tea.",
    "Dinner that evening was a stilted difficult meal.",
    "Nevile was sunk in\nabstraction Kays face had an unusual amount of makeup for her\nAudrey sat like a frozen ghost.",
    "Mary Aldin did her best to keep some\nkind of a conversation going and was slightly annoyed with Thomas\nRoyde for not playing up to her better.",
    "Hurstall was nervous and his hands trembled as he handed the\nvegetables.",
    "As the meal drew to a close Neville said with elaborate casualness\nThink I shall go over to Easterhead after dinner and look up Latimer.",
    "We might have a game of billiards.",
    "Take the latchkey said Mary.",
    "In case youre back late.",
    "Thanks I will.",
    "They went into the drawingroom where coffee was served.",
    "The turning on of the wireless and the news was a welcome diversion.",
    "Kay who had been yawning ostentatiously ever since dinner said she\nwould go up to bed.",
    "She had a headache she said.",
    "Have you got any aspirin asked Mary.",
    "Yes thank you.",
    "Kay left the room.",
    "Nevile turned the wireless on to a programme with music.",

    "Nevile glanced at the clock.",
    "It was already ten oclock.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders and went upstairs and along the corridor to\nLady Tressilians room and tapped on the door.",
    "While he waited for her\nto say come in he heard the voices of the others in the hall down\nbelow.",
    "Everybody was going to bed early tonight it seemed.",

    "Nevile went in shutting\nthe door behind him.",
    "Lady Tressilian was all ready for the night.",

    "Lady Tressilian did not\nsmile.",
    "There are certain things Nevile that I will not permit in my house.",
    "I\nhave no wish to listen to anybodys private conversations but if you\nand your wife insist on shouting at each other exactly under my\nbedroom windows I can hardly fail to hear what you say.",
    "I gather that\nyou were outlining a plan whereby Kay was to divorce you and in due\ncourse you would remarry Audrey.",
    "That Nevile is a thing you simply\ncannot do and I will not hear of it for a moment.",
    "Nevile seemed to be making an effort to control his temper.",
    "I apologise for the scene he said shortly.",
    "As for the rest of what you\nsay surely that is my business\n\nNo it is not.",
    "You have used my house in order to get into touch with\nAudrey  or else Audrey has used it \n\nShe has done nothing of the sort.",
    "She \n\nLady Tressilian stopped him with upraised hand.",
    "Anyway you cant do this thing Nevile.",

    "She has\ncertain rights of which you cannot deprive her.",
    "In this matter I am\nentirely on Kays side.",
    "You have made your bed and must lie upon it.",
    "Your duty now is to Kay and Im telling you so plainly \n\nNevile took a step forward.",
    "His voice rose This is nothing whatever to\ndo with you \n\nWhat is more Lady Tressilian swept on regardless of his protest\nAudrey leaves this house tomorrow \n\n\fYou cant do that I wont stand for it \n\nDont shout at me Nevile.",
    "I tell you I wont have it \n\nSomewhere along the passage a door shut ...\n\nXII\n\nAlice Bentham the gooseberryeyed housemaid came to Mrs. Spicer\nthe cook in some perturbation.",

    "I\n\nSuperintendent battle had enjoyed his holiday.",
    "There were still three\ndays of it to run and he was a little disappointed when the weather\nchanged and the rain fell.",
    "Still what else could you expect in England\nAnd hed been extremely lucky up to now.",
    "He was breakfasting with Inspector James Leach his nephew when\nthe telephone rang.",
    "Ill come right along sir.",
    "Jim put the receiver back.",
    "Serious asked Superintendent Battle.",
    "He noted the expression on\nhis nephews face.",
    "Weve got a murder.",
    "Lady Tressilian.",
    "An old lady very well known\ndown here an invalid.",
    "Has that house at Saltcreek that hangs right\nover the cliff.",
    "Battle nodded.",
    "Im going along to see the old man thus disrespectfully did Leach\nspeak of his Chief Constable.",
    "Hes a friend of hers.",
    "Were going along\ntogether.",
    "As he went to the door he said pleadingly Youll give me a hand wont\nyou uncle over this First case of this kind Ive had.",
    "As long as Im here I will.",
    "Case of robbery and housebreaking is it\n\nI dont know yet.",
    "II\n\nHalf an hour later Major Robert Mitchell the Chief Constable was\nspeaking gravely to uncle and nephew.",
    "Its early to say as yet he said but one thing seems clear.",
    "This\nwasnt an outside job.",
    "Nothing taken no signs of breaking in.",
    "All the\nwindows and doors found shut this morning.",
    "He looked directly at Battle.",
    "If I were to ask Scotland Yard do you think theyd put you on the job\nYoure on the spot you see.",
    "And then theres your relationship with\nLeach here.",
    "That is if youre willing.",
    "It means cutting the end of your\nholiday.",
    "Thats all right said Battle.",
    "As for the other sir youll have to put it\nup to Sir Edgar Sir Edgar Cotton was Assistant Commissioner but I\nbelieve hes a friend of yours\n\nMitchell nodded.",
    "Yes I think I can manage Edgar all right.",
    "Thats settled then Ill get\nthrough right away.",
    "He spoke into the telephone Get me the Yard.",
    "You think its going to be an important case sir asked Battle.",
    "Mitchell said gravely Its going to be a case where we dont want the\npossibility of making a mistake.",
    "We want to be absolutely sure of our\nman  or woman of course.",
    "Battle nodded.",
    "He understood quite well that there was something\nbehind the words.",
    "Thinks he knows who did it he said to himself.",
    "And doesnt relish\nthe prospect.",
    "Somebody well known and popular or Ill eat my boots\n\n\fIII\n\nBattle and Leach stood in the doorway of the wellfurnished handsome\nbedroom.",
    "On the floor in front of them a police officer was carefully\ntesting for fingerprints the handle of a golf club  a heavy niblick.",
    "The\nhead of the club was bloodstained and had one or two white hairs\nsticking to it.",
    "By the bed Dr. Lazenby who was police surgeon for the district was\nbending over the body of Lady Tressilian.",
    "He straightened up with a sigh.",
    "Perfectly straightforward.",
    "She was hit from in front with terrific force.",
    "First blow smashed in the bone and killed her but the murderer struck\nagain to make sure.",
    "I wont give you fancy terms  just the plain horse\nsense of it.",
    "How long has she been dead asked Leach.",
    "Id put it between ten\noclock and midnight.",
    "You cant go nearer than that\n\nId rather not.",
    "All sorts of factors to take into account.",
    "We dont hang\npeople on rigor mortis nowadays.",
    "Not earlier than ten not later than\nmidnight.",
    "And she was hit with this niblick The doctor glanced over at it.",
    "Presumably.",
    "Luck though that the murderer left it behind.",
    "I couldnt\nhave deduced a niblick from the wound.",
    "As it happens the sharp end\n\n\fof the club didnt touch the head  it was the angled back of the club\nthat must have hit her.",
    "Wouldnt that have been rather difficult to do asked Leach.",
    "If it had been done on purpose yes agreed the doctor.",
    "I can only\nsuppose that by a rather odd chance it just happened that way.",
    "Leach was raising his hands instinctively trying to reconstruct the\nblow.",
    "Awkward he commented.",
    "Yes said the doctor thoughtfully.",
    "The whole thing was awkward.",
    "She was struck you see on the right temple  but whoever did it must\nhave stood on the righthand side of the bed  facing the head of the\nbed  theres no room on the left the angle from the wall is too small.",
    "Leach pricked up his ears.",
    "Lefthanded he queried.",
    "You wont get me to commit myself on that point said Lazenby.",
    "Far\ntoo many snags.",
    "Ill say if you like that the easiest explanation is that\nthe murderer was lefthanded  but there are other ways of accounting\nfor it.",
    "Suppose for instance the old lady had turned her head slightly\nto the left just as the man hit.",
    "Or he may have previously moved the\nbed out stood on the left of it and afterwards moved the bed back.",
    "Not very likely that last.",
    "Perhaps not but it might have happened.",
    "Ive had some experience in\nthese things and I can tell you my boy deducing that a murderous\nblow was struck lefthanded is full of pitfalls.",
    "Detective Sergeant Jones from the floor remarked This golf club is\nthe ordinary righthanded kind.",
    "Leach nodded.",
    "Still it maynt have belonged to the man who used it.",
    "It\nwas a man I suppose doctor\n\nNot necessarily.",
    "If the weapon was that heavy niblick a woman could\nhave landed a terrible swipe with it.",
    "Superintendent Battle said in his quiet voice But you couldnt swear\nthat that was the weapon could you doctor\n\nLazenby gave him a quick interested glance.",
    "No.",
    "I can only swear that it might have been the weapon and that\npresumably it was the weapon.",
    "Ill analyse the blood on it make sure\nthat its the same blood group  also the hairs.",
    "Yes said Battle approvingly.",
    "Its always as well to be thorough.",
    "Lazenby asked curiously Got any doubts about that golf club\nyourself.",
    "Superintendent\n\nBattle shook his head.",
    "Oh no no.",
    "Im a simple man.",
    "Like to believe the things I see with my\neyes.",
    "She was hit with something heavy  thats heavy.",
    "It has blood and\nhair on it therefore presumably her blood and hair.",
    "Ergo  that was the\nweapon used.",
    "Leach asked Was she awake or asleep when she was hit\n\nIn my opinion awake.",
    "Theres astonishment on her face.",
    "Id say  this\nis just a private personal opinion  that she didnt expect what was\ngoing to happen.",
    "Theres no sign of any attempt to fight  and no horror\nor fear.",
    "Id say offhand that either she had just woken up from sleep\nand was hazy and didnt take things in  or else she recognised her\nassailant as someone who could not possibly wish to harm her.",
    "The bedside lamp was on and nothing else said Leach thoughtfully.",
    "Yes that cuts either way.",
    "She may have turned it on when she was\nsuddenly woken up by someone entering her room.",
    "Or it may have\nbeen on already.",
    "Detective Sergeant Jones rose to his feet.",
    "He was smiling\nappreciatively.",
    "Lovely set of prints on that club he said.",
    "Clear as\nanything Leach gave a deep sigh.",
    "That ought to simplify things.",
    "Obliging chap said Dr. Lazenby.",
    "Left the weapon  left his\nfingerprints on it wonder he didnt leave his visiting card\n\nIt might be said Superintendent Battle that he just lost his head.",
    "Some do.",
    "The doctor nodded.",
    "True enough.",
    "Well I must go and look after my other patient.",
    "What patient Battle sounded suddenly interested.",
    "I was sent for by the butler before this was discovered.",
    "Lady\nTressilians maid was found in a coma this morning.",
    "What was wrong with her\n\nHeavily doped with one of the barbiturates.",
    "Shes pretty bad but\nshell pull round.",
    "The maid said Battle.",
    "His rather oxlike eyes went heavily to the big\nbellpull the tassel of which rested on the pillow near the dead\nwomans hand.",
    "Lazenby nodded.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Thats the first thing Lady Tressilian would have done if shed\ncause to feel alarm  pull that bell and summon the maid.",
    "Well she\ncould have pulled it till all was blue.",
    "The maid wouldnt have heard.",
    "That was taken care of was it said Battle.",
    "Youre sure of that She\nwasnt in the habit of taking sleeping draughts\n\nIm positive she wasnt.",
    "Theres not a sign of such a thing in her room.",
    "And Ive found out how it was given to her.",
    "Senna pods.",
    "She drank off a\nbrew of senna pods every night.",
    "The stuff was in that.",
    "Superintendent Battle scratched his chin.",
    "Hm he said.",
    "Someone knew all about this house.",
    "You know doctor\nthis is a very odd sort of murder.",
    "Well said Lazenby thats your business.",
    "Hes a good man our doctor said Leach when Lazenby had left the\nroom.",
    "The two men were alone now.",
    "The photographs had been taken and\nmeasurements recorded.",
    "The two police officers knew every fact that\nwas to be known about the room where the crime had been committed.",
    "Battle nodded in answer to his nephews remark.",
    "He seemed to be\npuzzling over something.",
    "Do you think anyone could have handled that club  with gloves on\nsay after those fingerprints were made\n\nLeach shook his head.",
    "I dont and no more do you.",
    "You couldnt grasp that club  not use it I\nmean without smearing those prints.",
    "They werent smeared.",
    "They\nwere as clear as clear.",
    "You saw for yourself.",
    "Battle agreed.",
    "And now we ask very nicely and politely if everyone will allow us to\ntake their fingerprints  no compulsion of course.",
    "And everyone will\nsay yes  and then one of two things will happen.",
    "Either none of these\nfingerprints will agree or else \n\n\fOr else well have got our man\n\nI suppose so.",
    "Or our woman perhaps.",
    "Leach shook his head.",
    "No not a woman.",
    "Those prints on the club\nwere a mans.",
    "Too big for a womans.",
    "Besides this isnt a womans\ncrime.",
    "No agreed Battle.",
    "Quite a mans crime.",
    "Brutal masculine rather\nathletic and slightly stupid.",
    "Know anybody in the house like that\n\nI dont know anyone in the house yet.",
    "Theyre all together in the\ndiningroom.",
    "Battle moved towards the door.",
    "Well go and have a look at them.",
    "He glanced over his shoulder at the\nbed shook his head and remarked I dont like that bellpull.",
    "What about it\n\nIt doesnt fit.",
    "He added as he opened the door Who wanted to kill her I wonder A\nlot of cantankerous old ladies about just asking for a tap on the skull.",
    "She doesnt look that sort.",
    "I should think she was liked.",
    "He paused a\nminute and then asked Well off wasnt she Who gets her money\n\nLeach answered the implication of the words Youve hit it That will\nbe the answer.",
    "Its one of the first things to find out.",
    "As they went downstairs together Battle glanced at the list in his hand.",
    "He read out Miss Aldin Mr. Royde Mr.",
    "Strange Mrs.",
    "Strange Mrs.\nAudrey Strange.",
    "Hm seems a lot of the Strange family.",
    "Those are his two wives I understand.",
    "Battles eyebrows rose and he murmured Bluebeard is he\n\nThe family were assembled round the diningroom table where they\nhad made a pretence of eating.",
    "Superintendent Battle glanced keenly at the faces turned to him.",
    "He\nwas sizing them up after his own peculiar methods.",
    "His view of them\nmight have surprised them had they known it.",
    "It was a sternly biased\nview.",
    "No matter what the law pretends as to regarding people as\ninnocent until they are proved guilty Superintendent Battle always\nregarded everyone connected with a murder case as a potential\nmurderer.",
    "He glanced from Mary Aldin sitting upright and pale at the head of the\ntable to Thomas Royde filling a pipe beside her to Audrey sitting with\nher chair pushed back a coffee cup and saucer in her right hand a\ncigarette in her left to Nevile looking dazed and bewildered trying\nwith a shaking hand to light a cigarette to Kay with her elbows on the\ntable and the pallor of her face showing through her makeup.",
    "These were Superintendent Battles thoughts Suppose thats Miss\nAldin.",
    "Cool customer  competent woman I should say.",
    "Wont catch\nher off her guard easily.",
    "Man next to her is a dark horse  got a groggy\narm  poker face  got an inferiority complex as likely as not.",
    "Thats\n\n\fone of these wives I suppose  shes scared to death  yes shes\nscared all right.",
    "Funny about that coffee cup.",
    "Thats Strange Ive seen\nhim before somewhere.",
    "Hes got the jitters all right  nerves shot to\npieces.",
    "Redheaded girls a tartar  devil of a temper.",
    "Brains as well as\ntemper though.",
    "Whilst he was thus sizing them up Inspector Leach was making a stiff\nlittle speech.",
    "Mary Aldin mentioned everyone present by name.",
    "She ended up It has been a terrible shock to us of course but we are\nanxious to help you in any way we can.",
    "To begin with said Leach holding it up does anybody know\nanything about this golf club\n\nWith a little cry Kay said How horrible Is that what  and stopped.",
    "Nevile Strange got up and came round the table.",
    "Looks like one of mine.",
    "Can I just see\n\nIts quite all right now said Inspector Leach.",
    "You can handle it.",
    "That little significant now did not seem to produce any reaction in\nthe onlookers.",
    "Nevile examined the club.",
    "I think its one of the niblicks out of my bag he said.",
    "I can tell you for\nsure in a minute or two.",
    "If you will just come with me.",
    "They followed\nhim to a big cupboard under the stairs.",
    "He flung open the door of it and\nto Battles confused eyes it seemed literally crowded with tennis\n\n\fracquets.",
    "At the same time he remembered where he had seen Nevile\nStrange before.",
    "He said quickly Ive seen you play at Wimbledon\nsir.",
    "Nevile half turned his head.",
    "Oh yes have you\n\nHe was throwing aside some of the racquets.",
    "There were two golf\nbags in the cupboard leaning up against fishing tackle.",
    "Only my wife and I play golf explained Nevile.",
    "And thats a mans\nclub.",
    "Yes thats right  its mine.",
    "He had taken out his bag which contained at least fourteen clubs.",
    "Inspector Leach thought to himself These athletic chaps certainly\ntake themselves seriously.",
    "Wouldnt like to be his caddy.",
    "Nevile was saying Its one of Walter Hudosns niblicks from St.\nEsberts.",
    "Thank you Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "That settles one question.",
    "Nevile said What beats me is that nothing was taken.",
    "And the house\ndoesnt seem to have been broken into His voice was bewildered but it was also frightened.",
    "Battle said to himself Theyve been thinking it out all of them ...",
    "The\nservants said Nevile are absolutely harmless.",
    "I shall talk to Miss Aldin about the servants said Inspector Leach\nsmoothly.",
    "In the meantime I wonder if you could give me any idea\nwho Lady Tressilians solicitors are\n\n\fAskwith  Trelawny replied Nevile promptly.",
    "St. Loo.",
    "Thank you Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "We shall have to find out from them all about\nLady Tressilians property.",
    "Do you mean asked Nevile who inherits her money Thats right\nsir.",
    "Her will and all that.",
    "I dont know about her will said Nevile.",
    "She had not very much of\nher own to leave so far as I know.",
    "I can tell you about the bulk of her\nproperty.",
    "Yes Mr.",
    "Strange\n\nIt comes to me and my wife under the will of the late Sir Matthew\nTressilian.",
    "Lady Tressilian only had a life interest in it.",
    "Indeed is that so Inspector Leach looked at Nevile with the\ninterested attention of someone who spots a possibly valuable addition\nto his pet collection.",
    "The look made Nevile wince nervously.",
    "Inspector\nLeach went on and his voice was impossibly genial Youve no idea of\nthe amount Mr.",
    "Strange\n\nI couldnt tell you offhand.",
    "In the neighbourhood of a hundred\nthousand pounds I believe.",
    "Indeed.",
    "To each of you No divided between us.",
    "I see.",
    "A very\nconsiderable sum.",
    "Nevile smiled.",
    "He said quietly Ive got plenty to live on of my own you\nknow without hankering to step into dead peoples shoes.",
    "Inspector Leach looked shocked at having such ideas attributed to\nhim.",
    "They went back into the diningroom and Leach said his next little\npiece.",
    "This was on the subject of fingerprints  a matter of routine elimination of those of the household in the dead womans bedroom.",
    "Everyone expressed willingness  almost eagerness  to have their\nfingerprints taken.",
    "They were shepherded into the library for that\npurpose where Detective Sergeant Jones was waiting for them with\nhis little roller.",
    "Battle and Leach began on the servants.",
    "Nothing very much was to be got from them.",
    "Hurstall explained his\nsystem of locking up the house and swore that he had found it\nuntouched in the morning.",
    "There were no signs of any entry by an\nintruder.",
    "The front door he explained had been left on the latch.",
    "That\nis to say it was not bolted but could be opened from outside with a\nkey.",
    "It was left like that because Mr. Nevile had gone over to\nEasterhead Bay and would be back late.",
    "Do you know what time he came in\n\nYes sir.",
    "I think it was about halfpast two.",
    "Someone came back with\nhim I think.",
    "I heard voices and then a car drive away and then I heard\nthe door close and Mr. Nevile come upstairs.",
    "What time did he leave here last night for Easterhead Bay About\ntwenty past ten.",
    "I heard the door close.",
    "Leach nodded.",
    "There did not seem to be much more to be got from\nHurstall at the moment.",
    "He interviewed the others.",
    "They were all\ndisposed to be nervous and frightened but no more so than was\nnatural under the circumstances.",
    "Leach looked questioningly at his uncle as the door closed behind the\nslightly hysterical kitchenmaid who had tailed the procession.",
    "Battle said Have the housemaid back  not the popeyed one  the tall\nthin bit of vinegar.",
    "She knows something.",
    "Emma Wales was clearly uneasy.",
    "It alarmed her that this time it was\nthe big square elderly man who took upon himself the task of\nquestioning her.",
    "Im just going to give you a bit of advice.",
    "Miss Wales he said\npleasantly.",
    "It doesnt do you know to hold anything back from the\npolice.",
    "Makes them look at you unfavourably if you understand what I\nmean \n\nEmma Wales protested indignantly but uneasily Im sure I never \n\nNow now.",
    "Battle held up a large square hand.",
    "You saw something\nor else you heard something  what was it\n\n\fI didnt exactly hear it I mean I couldnt help hearing it  Mr. Hurstall\nhe heard it too.",
    "And I dont think not for a moment I dont that it had\nanything to do with the murder.",
    "Probably not probably not.",
    "Just tell us what it was.",
    "Well I was going up to bed.",
    "Just after ten it was  and Id slipped\nalong first to put Miss Aldins hotwater bottle in her bed.",
    "Summer or\nwinter she always has one and so of course I had to pass by her\nladyships door.",
    "Go on said Battle.",
    "And I heard her and Mr. Nevile going at it hammer and tongs.",
    "Voices\nright up.",
    "Shouting he was.",
    "Oh it was a proper quarrel\n\nRemember exactly what was said\n\nWell I wasnt really listening as you might say.",
    "No.",
    "But still you must have heard some of the words.",
    "Her ladyship was saying as she wouldnt have something or other\ngoing on in her house and Mr. Nevile was saying Dont you dare say\nanything against her.",
    "All worked up he was.",
    "Battle with an expressionless face tried once more but he could get\nno more out of her.",
    "In the end he dismissed the woman.",
    "He and Jim looked at each other.",
    "Leach said after a minute or two\nJones ought to be able to tell us something about those prints by\nnow.",
    "Battle asked Whos doing the rooms\n\nWilliams.",
    "Hes a good man.",
    "He wont miss anything.",
    "Youre keeping the occupants out of them\n\nYes until Williams has finished.",
    "The door opened at that minute and young Williams put his head in.",
    "Theres something Id like you to see.",
    "In Mr. Nevile Stranges room.",
    "They got up and followed him to the suite on the west side of the\nhouse.",
    "Williams pointed to a heap on the floor.",
    "A dark blue coat trousers and\nwaistcoat.",
    "Leach said sharply Where did you find this\n\nBundled down into the bottom of the wardrobe.",
    "Just look at this sir.",
    "He picked up the coat and showed the edges of the dark blue cuffs.",
    "See those dark stains Thats blood sir or Im a Dutchman.",
    "And see\nhere its spattered all up the sleeve.",
    "Hm.",
    "Battle avoided the others eager eyes.",
    "Looks bad for young\nNevile I must say.",
    "Any other suit in the room\n\nDark grey pinstripe hanging over a chair.",
    "Lot of water on the floor\nhere by the washbasin.",
    "Looking as though he washed the blood off himself in the devil of a\nhurry Yes.",
    "Its near the open window though and the rain has come\nin a good deal.",
    "Not enough to make those pools on the floor sir.",
    "Theyre not dried up\nyet.",
    "Battle was silent.",
    "A picture was forming itself before his eyes.",
    "A man\nwith blood on his hands and sleeves flinging off his clothes bundling\nthe bloodstained garments into the cupboard sluicing water furiously\nover his hands and bare arms.",
    "He looked across at the door in the other wall.",
    "Williams answered the look.",
    "Mrs. Stranges room sir.",
    "The door is locked.",
    "Locked On this side\n\nNo.",
    "On the other.",
    "On her side eh\n\n\fBattle was reflective for a minute or two.",
    "He said at last Lets see that\nold butler again.",
    "Hurstall was nervous.",
    "Leach said crisply Why didnt you tell us\nHurstall that you overheard a quarrel between Mr.",
    "Strange and Lady\nTressilian last night\n\nThe old man blinked.",
    "I really didnt think twice about it sir.",
    "I dont imagine it was what youd\ncall a quarrel  just an amicable difference of opinion.",
    "Resisting the temptation to say Amicable difference of opinion my\nfoot Leach went on What suit was Mr.",
    "Strange wearing last night at\ndinner\n\nHurstall hesitated.",
    "Battle said quietly Dark blue suit or grey\npinstripe I dare say someone else can tell us if you dont remember.",
    "Hurstall broke his silence.",
    "I remember now sir.",
    "It was his dark blue.",
    "The family he added\nanxious not to lose prestige have not been in the habit of changing\ninto evening dress during the summer months.",
    "They frequently go out\nafter dinner  sometimes in the garden sometimes down to the quay.",
    "Battle nodded.",
    "Hurstall left the room.",
    "He passed Jones in the doorway.",
    "Jones looked excited.",
    "He said Its a cinch sir.",
    "Ive got all their prints.",
    "Theres only one lot\nfits the bill.",
    "Of course Ive only been able to make a rough comparison\nas yet but Ill bet theyre the right ones.",
    "Well said Battle.",
    "The prints on that niblick handle sir were made by Mr. Nevile\nStrange.",
    "Battle leant back in his chair.",
    "Well he said that seems to settle it doesnt it\n\nIV\n\nThey were in the Chief Constables office  three men with grave\nworried faces.",
    "Major Mitchell said with a sigh Well I suppose theres nothing to be\ndone but arrest him\n\nLeach said quietly Looks like it sir.",
    "Mitchell looked across at Superintendent Battle.",
    "Cheer up.",
    "Battle he said kindly.",
    "Your best friend isnt dead.",
    "Superintendent Battle sighed.",
    "I dont like it he said.",
    "I dont think any of us like it said Mitchell.",
    "But weve ample\nevidence I think to apply for a warrant.",
    "More than ample said Battle.",
    "In fact if we dont apply for one anybody might ask why the dickens\nnot\n\nBattle nodded an unhappy head.",
    "Lets go over it said the Chief Constable.",
    "Youve got motive Strange and his wife come into a considerable sum of money at the old\nladys death.",
    "Hes the last person known to have seen her alive  he\nwas heard quarrelling with her.",
    "The suit he wore that night had\nbloodstains on it of course most damning of all his fingerprints were\nfound on the actual weapon  and no one elses.",
    "And yet sir said Battle you dont like it either.",
    "Im damned if I do.",
    "What is it exactly you dont like about it sir\n\nMajor Mitchell rubbed his nose.",
    "Makes the fellow out a bit too much of\na fool perhaps he suggested.",
    "And yet sir they do behave like fools sometimes.",
    "Oh I know I\nknow.",
    "Where would we be if they didnt Battle said to Leach What\ndont you like about it Jim Leach stirred unhappily.",
    "Ive always liked Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Seen him on and off down here for\nyears.",
    "Hes a nice gentleman  and hes a sportsman.",
    "I dont see said Battle slowly why a good tennis player shouldnt be\na murderer as well.",
    "Theres nothing against it.",
    "He paused.",
    "What I\ndont like is the niblick.",
    "The niblick asked Mitchell slightly puzzled.",
    "Yes sir or alternatively the bell.",
    "The bell or the niblick  not both.",
    "He went on in his slow careful voice.",
    "What do we think actually happened Did Mr.",
    "Strange go to her room\nhave a quarrel lose his temper and hit her over the head with a\nniblick.",
    "If so and it was unpremeditated how did he happen to have a\nniblick with him Its not the sort of thing you carry about with you in\nthe evenings.",
    "He might nave been practising swings  something like that.",
    "He might  but nobody says so.",
    "Nobody saw him doing it.",
    "The last time\nanybody saw him with a niblick in his hand was about a week\npreviously when he was practising sand shots down on the sands.",
    "As I\nlook at it you see you cant have it both ways.",
    "Either there was a\nquarrel and he lost his temper  and mind you Ive seen him on the\ncourts and in one of these tournament matches these tennis stars are\nall het up and a mass of nerves and if their tempers fray easily its\ngoing to show.",
    "Ive never seen Mr.",
    "Strange ruffled.",
    "I should say hes\n\n\fgot an excellent control over his temper  better than most  and yet\nwere suggesting that he goes berserk and hits a frail old lady over the\nhead.",
    "Theres another alternative Battle said the Chief Constable.",
    "I know sir.",
    "The theory that it was premeditated.",
    "He wanted the old\nladys money.",
    "That fits in with the bell  which entailed the doping of the\nmaid  but it doesnt fit in with the niblick and the quarrel If hed made\nup his mind to do her in hed be very careful not to quarrel with her.",
    "He could dope the maid creep into her room in the night  crack her\nover the head and stage a nice little robbery wiping the niblick and\nputting it carefully back where it belonged Its all wrong sir  its a\nmixture of cold premeditation and unpremeditated violence and the\ntwo dont mix\n\nTheres something in what you say.",
    "Battle  but  whats the\nalternative Its the niblick that takes my fancy sir.",
    "Nobody could have hit her over the head with that niblick without\ndisturbing Neviles prints  thats quite certain.",
    "In that case said Battle she was hit over the head with something\nelse.",
    "Major Mitchell drew a deep breath.",
    "Thats rather a wild\nassumption isnt it\n\nI think its common sense sir.",
    "Either Strange hit her with that niblick\nor nobody did.",
    "I plump for nobody.",
    "In that case that niblick was put\nthere deliberately and blood and hair smeared on it.",
    "Dr. Lazenby\ndoesnt like the niblick much  had to accept it because it was the\n\n\fobvious thing and because he couldnt say definitely that it hadnt been\nused.",
    "Major Mitchell leaned back in his chair.",
    "Go on.",
    "Battle he said.",
    "Im giving you a free hand.",
    "Whats the next\nstep\n\nTake away the niblick said Battle and what is left First motive.",
    "Had Nevile Strange really got a motive for doing away with Lady\nTressilian He inherited money  a lot depends to my mind on whether\nhe needed that money.",
    "He says not.",
    "Id suggest we verify that.",
    "Find out\nthe state of his finances.",
    "If hes in a hole financially and needs money\nthen the case against him is very much strengthened.",
    "If on the other\nhand he was speaking the truth and his finances are in a good state\nwhy then \n\nWell what then\n\nWhy then we might have a look at the motives of the other people in\nthe house.",
    "You think then that Nevile Strange was framed Superintendent\nBattle screwed up his eyes.",
    "Theres a phrase I read somewhere that tickled my fancy.",
    "Something\nabout a fine Italian hand.",
    "Thats what I seem to see in this business.",
    "Ostensibly its a blunt brutal straightforward crime but it seems to\nme I catch glimpses of something else  of a fine Italian hand at work\nbehind the scenes ...",
    "There was a long pause while the Chief Constable looked at Battle.",
    "You may be right he said at last.",
    "Dash it all theres something\nfunny about the business.",
    "Whats your idea now of our plan of\ncampaign\n\nBattle stroked his square jaw.",
    "Well sir he said.",
    "Im always in favour of going about things the\nobvious way.",
    "Everythings been set to make us suspicious of Mr. Nevile\nStrange.",
    "Lets go on being suspicious of him.",
    "Neednt go so far as\nactually to arrest him but hint at it question him put the wind up him and observe everybodys reactions generally.",
    "Verify his statements\ngo over his movements that night with a toothcomb.",
    "In fact show our\nhand as plainly as may be.",
    "Quite Machiavellian said Major Mitchell with a twinkle.",
    "Imitation of a\nheavyhanded policeman by star actor Battle.",
    "The Superintendent smiled.",
    "I always like doing whats expected of me sir.",
    "This time I mean to be a\nbit slow about it  take my time.",
    "I want to do some nosing about.",
    "Being\nsuspicious of Mr. Nevile Strange is a very good excuse for nosing\nabout.",
    "Ive an idea you know that something rather odd has been\ngoing on in that house.",
    "Looking for the sex angle\n\nIf you like to put it that way sir.",
    "Handle it your own way Battle.",
    "You and Leach carry on between\nyou.",
    "Thank you sir.",
    "Battle stood up.",
    "Nothing suggestive from the\nsolicitors\n\nNo.",
    "I rang them up.",
    "I know Trelawny fairly well.",
    "Hes sending me a\ncopy of Sir Matthews will and also of Lady Tressilians.",
    "She had about\nfive hundred a year of her own  invested in giltedged securities.",
    "She\nleft a legacy to Barrett and a small one to Hurstall the rest to Mary\nAldin.",
    "Thats three we might keep an eye on said Battle.",
    "Mitchell looked\namused.",
    "Suspicious fellow arent you\n\nNo use letting oneself be hypnotised by fifty thousand pounds said\nBattle stolidly.",
    "Many a murder has been done for less than fifty\npounds.",
    "It depends on how much you want the money.",
    "Barrett got a\nlegacy  and maybe she took the precaution to dope herself so as to\navert suspicion.",
    "She very nearly passed out.",
    "Lazenby hasnt let us question her yet.",
    "Overdid it out of ignorance perhaps.",
    "Then Hurstall may have been in\nbad need of cash for all we know.",
    "And Miss Aldin if shes no money of\nher own might have fancied a bit of life on a nice little income before\nshes too old to enjoy it.",
    "The Chief Constable looked doubtful.",
    "Well he said its up to you two.",
    "Get on with the job.",
    "V\n\nBack at Gulls Point the two police officers received Williams and\nJones reports.",
    "Nothing of a suspicious or suggestive nature had been found in any of\nthe bedrooms.",
    "The servants were clamouring to be allowed to get on\nwith the housework.",
    "Should he give them the word\n\nMight as well I suppose said Battle.",
    "Ill just have a stroll myself first\nthrough the two upper floors.",
    "Rooms that havent been done very often\ntell you something about their occupants thats useful to know.",
    "Sergeant Jones put down a small cardboard box on the table.",
    "From Mr. Nevile Stranges dark blue coat he announced.",
    "The red\nhairs were on the cuff blonde hairs on the inside of the collar and the\nright shoulder.",
    "Battle took out the two long red hairs and the halfdozen blonde ones\nand looked at them.",
    "He said with a faint twinkle in his eye\nConvenient.",
    "One blonde one redhead and one brunette in this\nhouse.",
    "So we know where we are at once.",
    "Red hair on the cuff blonde\non the collar Mr. Nevile Strange does seem to be a bit of a Bluebeard.",
    "His arm round one wife and the other ones head on his shoulder.",
    "The blood on the sleeve has gone for analysis sir.",
    "Theyll ring us up\nas soon as they get the result.",
    "Leach nodded.",
    "What about the servants\n\nI followed your instructions sir.",
    "None of them is under notice to leave\nor seems likely to have borne a grudge against the old lady.",
    "She was\nstrict but well liked.",
    "In any case the management of the servants lay\nwith Miss Aldin.",
    "She seems to have been popular with them.",
    "Thought she was an efficient woman the moment I laid eyes on her\nsaid Battle.",
    "If shes our murderess she wont be easy to hang.",
    "Jones looked startled.",
    "But those prints on that niblick sir were \n\nI know I know said Battle.",
    "The singularly obliging Mr. Stranges.",
    "Theres a general belief that athletes arent overburdened by brains\nnot at all true by the way but I cant believe Nevile Strange is a\ncomplete moron.",
    "What about those senna pods of the maids\n\nThey were always on the shelf in the servants bathroom on the\nsecond floor.",
    "She used to put em in to soak midday and they stood\nthere until the evening when she went to bed.",
    "So that absolutely anybody could get at them Anybody inside the\nhouse that is to say.",
    "Leach said with conviction Its an inside job all right\n\nYes I think so.",
    "Not that this is one of those closed circle crimes.",
    "It\nisnt.",
    "Anyone who had a key could have opened the front door and\nwalked in.",
    "Nevile Strange had that key last night  but it would probably\nbe a simple matter to have got one cut or an old hand could do it with\na bit of wire.",
    "But I dont see any outsider knowing about the bell and\nthat Barrett took senna at night Thats local inside knowledge\n\nCome along Jim my boy.",
    "Lets go up and see this bathroom and all\nthe rest of it.",
    "They started on the top floor.",
    "First came a boxroom full of old broken\nfurniture and junk of all kinds.",
    "I havent looked through this sir said Jones.",
    "I didnt know \n\nWhat you were looking for Quite right.",
    "Only waste of time.",
    "From the\ndust on the floor nobody has been in here for at least six months.",
    "The servants rooms were all on this floor also two unoccupied\nbedrooms with a bathroom and Battle looked into each room and gave\nit a cursory glance noticing that Alice the popeyed housemaid slept\nwith her window shut that Emma the thin one had a great many\nrelations photographs of whom were crowded on her chest of\ndrawers and that Hurstall had one or two pieces of good though\ncracked Dresden and Crown Derby porcelain.",
    "The cooks room was severely neat and the kitchenmaids chaotically\nuntidy.",
    "Battle passed on into the bathroom which was the room\nnearest to the head of the stairs.",
    "Williams pointed out the long shelf\nover the washbasin on which stood tooth glasses and brushes\nvarious unguents and bottles of salts and hair lotion.",
    "A packet of senna\npods stood open at one end.",
    "No prints on the glass or packet\n\nOnly the maids own.",
    "I got hers from her room.",
    "He didnt need to handle the glass said Leach.",
    "Hed only have to\ndrop the stuff in.",
    "Battle went down the stairs followed by Leach.",
    "Halfway down this top\nflight was a rather awkwardly placed window.",
    "A pole with a hook on\nthe end stood in a corner.",
    "You draw down the top sash with that explained Leach.",
    "But theres\na burglar screw.",
    "The window can be drawn down only so far.",
    "Too\nnarrow for anyone to get in that way.",
    "I wasnt thinking of anyone getting in said Battle.",
    "His eyes were\nthoughtful.",
    "He went in the first bedroom on the next floor which was Audrey\nStranges.",
    "It was neat and fresh ivory brushes on the dressingtable no clothes lying about.",
    "Battle looked into the wardrobe.",
    "Two plain\ncoats and skirts a couple of evening dresses one or two summer\n\n\ffrocks.",
    "The dresses were cheap the tailormades well cut and\nexpensive but not new.",
    "Battle nodded.",
    "He stood at the writing table a minute or two fiddling\nwith the pen tray on the left of the blotter.",
    "Williams said Nothing of any interest on the blotting paper or in the\nwastepaper basket.",
    "Your words good enough said Battle.",
    "Nothing to be seen here.",
    "They went on to the other rooms.",
    "Thomas Roydes was untidy with the clothes lying about.",
    "Pipes and\npipe ash on the tables and beside the bed where a copy of Kiplings\nKim lay half open.",
    "Used to native servants clearing up after him said Battle.",
    "Likes\nreading old favourites.",
    "Conservative type.",
    "Mary Aldins room was small but comfortable.",
    "Battle looked at the\ntravel books on the shelves and the oldfashioned dented silver\nbrushes.",
    "The furnishings and colouring in the room were more modern\nthan the rest of the house.",
    "Shes not so conservative said Battle.",
    "No photographs either.",
    "Not\none who lives in the past.",
    "There were three or four empty rooms all well kept and dusted ready\nfor occupation and a couple of bathrooms.",
    "Then came Lady\nTressilians big double room.",
    "After that reached by going down three\n\n\flittle steps came the two rooms and bathroom occupied by the\nStranges.",
    "Battle did not waste much time in Neviles room.",
    "He glanced out of the\nopen casement window below which the rocks fell sheer to the sea.",
    "The view was to the west towards Stark Head which rose wild and\nforbidding out of the water.",
    "Gets the afternoon sun he murmured.",
    "But rather a grim morning\noutlook.",
    "Nasty smell of seaweed at low tide too.",
    "And that headland\nhas got a grim look.",
    "Dont wonder it attracts suicides\n\nHe passed into the larger room the door of which had been unlocked.",
    "Here everything was in wild confusion.",
    "Clothes lay about in heaps filmy underwear stockings jumpers tried on and discarded  a\npatterned summer frock thrown sprawling over the back of a chair.",
    "Battle looked inside the wardrobe.",
    "It was full of furs evening dresses\nshorts tennis frocks playsuits.",
    "Battle shut me doors again almost reverently.",
    "Expensive tastes he remarked.",
    "She must cost her husband a lot of\nmoney.",
    "Leach said darkly Perhaps thats why  He left the sentence\nunfinished.",
    "Why he needed a hundred  or rather fifty thousand pounds Maybe.",
    "Wed better see I think what he has to say about it.",
    "They went down to the library.",
    "Williams was despatched to tell the\nservants they could get on with the housework.",
    "The family were free to\nreturn to their rooms if they wished.",
    "They were to be informed of that\nfact and also that Inspector Leach would like an interview with each of\nthem separately starting with Mr. Nevile Strange.",
    "When Williams had gone out of the room Battle and Leach established\nthemselves behind a massive Victorian table.",
    "A young policeman with\nnotebook sat in the corner of the room his pencil poised.",
    "Battle said You carry on for a start Jim.",
    "Make it impressive.",
    "As the\nother nodded his head.",
    "Battle rubbed his chin and frowned.",
    "I wish I knew what keeps putting Hercule Poirot into my head.",
    "You\nmean that old chap  the Belgian  comic little guy\n\nComic my foot said Superintendent Battle.",
    "About as dangerous as\na black mamba and a sheleopard  thats what he is when he starts\nmaking a mountebank of himself I wish he was here  this sort of thing\nwould be right up his street.",
    "In what way\n\nPsychology said Battle.",
    "Real psychology  not the halfbaked stuff\npeople hand out who know nothing about it.",
    "His memory dwelt\nresentfully on Miss Amphrey and his daughter Sylvia.",
    "No  the real\ngenuine article  knowing just what makes the wheels go round.",
    "Keep\na murderer talking  thats one of his lines.",
    "Says everyone is bound to\nspeak whats true sooner or later  because in the end its easier than\n\n\ftelling lies.",
    "And so they make some little slip they dont think matters and thats when you get them.",
    "So youre going to give Nevile Strange plenty of rope\n\nBattle gave an absentminded assent.",
    "Then he added in some\nannoyance and perplexity But whats really worrying me is  what put\nHercule Poirot into my head Upstairs  thats where it was.",
    "Now what\ndid I see that reminded me of that little guy\n\nThe conversation was put to an end by the arrival of Nevile Strange.",
    "He looked pale and worried but much less nervous than he had done\nat the breakfast table.",
    "Battle eyed him keenly.",
    "Incredible that a man\nwho knew  and he must know if he were capable of any thought\nprocesses at all  that he had left his fingerprints on the instrument of\nthe crime  and who had since had his fingerprints taken by the police should show neither intense nervousness nor elaborate brazening of it\nout.",
    "Nevile Strange looked quite natural  shocked worried grieved  and\njust slightly and healthily nervous.",
    "Jim Leach was speaking in his pleasant West Country voice.",
    "We\nwould like you to answer certain questions Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Both as to\nyour movements last night and in reference to particular facts.",
    "At the\nsame time I must caution you that you are not bound to answer these\nquestions unless you like and that if you prefer to do so you may have\nyour solicitor present.",
    "He leaned back to observe the effect of this.",
    "Nevile Strange looked\nquite plainly bewildered.",
    "He hasnt the least idea what were getting at or else hes a damned\ngood actor Leach thought to himself.",
    "Aloud he said as Nevile did not\nanswer Well Mr.",
    "Strange\n\nNevile said Of course ask me anything you like.",
    "You realise said Battle pleasantly that anything you say will be\ntaken down in writing and may subsequently be used in a court of law\nin evidence.",
    "A flash of temper showed on Stranges face.",
    "He said sharply Are you\nthreatening me\n\nNo no Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Warning you.",
    "Nevile shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I suppose all this is part of your routine.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "You are ready to make a statement\n\nIf thats what you call it.",
    "Then will you tell us exactly what you did last night.",
    "From dinner\nonwards shall we say\n\n\fCertainly.",
    "After dinner we went into the drawingroom.",
    "We had\ncoffee.",
    "We listened to the wireless  the news and so on.",
    "Then I\ndecided to go across to Easterhead Bay Hotel and look up a chap who\nis staying there  a friend of mine.",
    "That friends name is Latimer.",
    "Edward Latimer.",
    "An intimate\nfriend\n\nOh soso.",
    "Weve seen a good deal of him since hes been down here.",
    "Hes been over to lunch and dinner and weve been over there.",
    "Battle said Rather late wasnt it to go off to Easterhead Bay Oh\nits a gay spot  they keep it up till all hours.",
    "But this is rather an\nearlytobed household isnt it\n\nYes on the whole.",
    "However I took the latchkey with me.",
    "Nobody had\nto sit up.",
    "Your wife didnt think of going with you\n\nThere was a slight change a stiffening in Neviles tone as he said No\nshe had a headache.",
    "Shed already gone up to bed.",
    "Please go on Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "I was just going up to change \n\nLeach interrupted Excuse me Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Change into what Into\nevening dress or out of evening dress\n\nNeither.",
    "I was wearing a blue suit  my best as it happened and as it\nwas raining a bit and I proposed to take the ferry and walk the other\n\n\fside  its about half a mile as you know  I changed into an older suit a grey pinstripe if you want me to go into every detail.",
    "We do like to get things clear said Leach humbly.",
    "Please go on.",
    "I was going upstairs as I say when Barrett came and told me Lady\nTressilian wanted to see me so I went along and had a  a jaw with her\nfor a bit.",
    "Battle said gently You were the last person to see her alive I think\nMr.",
    "Strange\n\nNevile flushed.",
    "Yes  yes I suppose I was.",
    "She was quite all right then.",
    "How long were you with her\n\nAbout twenty minutes to half an hour I should think then I went to my\nroom changed my suit and hurried off.",
    "I took the latchkey with me.",
    "What time was that\n\nAbout halfpast ten I should think.",
    "I hurried down the hill just caught\nthe ferry starting and went across to the Easterhead side.",
    "I found\nLatimer at the hotel we had a drink or two and a game of billiards.",
    "The\ntime passed so quickly that I found Id lost the last ferry back.",
    "It goes at\nonethirty.",
    "So Latimer very decently got out his car and drove me\nback.",
    "That as you know means going all the way round by Saltington sixteen miles.",
    "We left the hotel at two oclock and got back here\n\n\fsomewhere around halfpast I should say.",
    "I thanked Ted Latimer\nasked him in for a drink but he said hed rather get straight back so I\nlet myself in and went straight up to bed.",
    "I didnt see or hear anything\namiss.",
    "The house seemed all asleep and peaceful.",
    "Then this morning I\nheard that girl screaming and \n\nLeach stopped him.",
    "Quite quite.",
    "Now to go back a little  to your conversation with Lady\nTressilian was she quite normal in her manner\n\nOh absolutely.",
    "What did you talk about\n\nOh one thing and another.",
    "Amicably\n\nNevile flushed.",
    "Certainly.",
    "You didnt for instance went on Leach smoothly have a violent\nquarrel\n\nNevile did not answer at once.",
    "Leach said You had better tell the\ntruth you know.",
    "Ill tell you frankly some of your conversation was\noverheard.",
    "Nevile said shortly We had a bit of a disagreement.",
    "It was nothing.",
    "What was the subject of the disagreement\n\nWith an effort Nevile recovered his temper.",
    "He smiled.",
    "Frankly he said she ticked me off.",
    "That often happened.",
    "If she\ndisapproved of anyone she let them have it straight from the shoulder.",
    "She was oldfashioned you see and she was inclined to be down on\nmodern ways and modern lines of thought  divorce  all that.",
    "We had\nan argument and I may have got a bit heated but we parted on\nperfectly friendly terms  agreeing to differ.",
    "He added with some\nheat I certainly didnt bash her over the head because I lost my\ntemper over an argument  if thats what you think\n\nLeach glanced at Battle.",
    "Battle leaned forward ponderously across the\ntable.",
    "He said You recognised that niblick as your property this\nmorning.",
    "Have you any explanation for the fact that your fingerprints\nwere found upon it\n\nNevile stared.",
    "He said sharply I  but of course they would be  its my\nclub  Ive often handled it.",
    "Any explanation I mean for the fact that your fingerprints show that\nyou were the last person to have handled it.",
    "Nevile sat quite still.",
    "The colour had gone out of his face.",
    "Thats not true he said at last.",
    "It cant be.",
    "Somebody could have\nhandled it after me  someone wearing gloves.",
    "No Mr.",
    "Strange  nobody could have handled it in the sense you mean\n by raising it to strike  without blurring your own marks.",
    "There was a pause  a very long pause.",
    "Oh God said Nevile convulsively and gave a long shudder.",
    "He put\nhis hands over his eyes.",
    "The two policemen watched him.",
    "Then he took away his hands.",
    "He sat up straight.",
    "It isnt true he said quietly.",
    "It simply isnt true.",
    "You think I killed her\nbut I didnt.",
    "I swear I didnt.",
    "Theres some horrible mistake.",
    "Youve no explanation to offer about these fingerprints\n\nHow can I have Im dumbfounded.",
    "Have you any explanation for the fact that the sleeves and cuffs of\nyour dark blue suit are stained with blood.",
    "Blood   It was a horrorstruck whisper.",
    "It couldnt be You didnt\nfor instance cut yourself  No.",
    "No of course I didnt.",
    "They waited a\nlittle while.",
    "Nevile Strange his forehead creased seemed to be thinking.",
    "He\nlooked up at them at last with frightened horrorstricken eyes.",
    "Its fantastic he said.",
    "Simply fantastic.",
    "Its none of it true.",
    "Facts\nare true enough said Superintendent Battle.",
    "But why should I do such a thing Its unthinkable  unbelievable Ive\nknown Camilla all my life.",
    "Leach coughed.",
    "I believe you told us yourself Mr.",
    "Strange that you come into a good\ndeal of money upon Lady Tressilians death\n\nYou think thats why  But I dont want money I dont need it That\nsaid Leach with his little cough is what you say Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Nevile\nsprang up.",
    "Look here thats something I can prove.",
    "That I didnt need money.",
    "Let\nme ring up my bank manager  you can talk to him yourself.",
    "The call was put through.",
    "The line was clear and in a very few minutes\nthey were through to London.",
    "Nevile spoke That you Ronaldson\nNevile Strange speaking.",
    "You know my voice.",
    "Look here will you give\nthe police  theyre here now  all the information they want about my\naffairs  yes  yes please.",
    "Leach took the phone.",
    "He spoke quietly.",
    "It went on question and\nanswer.",
    "He replaced the phone at last.",
    "Well said Nevile eagerly.",
    "Leach said impassively You have a substantial credit balance and\nthe bank have charge of all your investments and report them to be in\na favourable condition.",
    "So you see its true what I said\n\n\fIt seems so  but again Mr.",
    "Strange you may have commitments\ndebts payment of blackmail  reasons for requiring money of which we\ndo not know.",
    "But I havent I assure you I havent.",
    "You wont find anything of that\nkind.",
    "Superintendent Battle shifted his heavy shoulders.",
    "He spoke in a kind\nfatherly voice.",
    "Weve sufficient evidence as Im sure youll agree Mr.",
    "Strange to ask\nfor a warrant for your arrest.",
    "We havent done so  as yet.",
    "Were giving\nyou the benefit of the doubt you see.",
    "Nevile said bitterly You mean dont you that youve made up your\nminds I did it but you want to get at the motive so as to clinch the\ncase against me\n\nBattle was silent.",
    "Leach looked at the ceiling.",
    "Nevile said desperately Its like some awful dream.",
    "Theres nothing I\ncan say or do.",
    "Its like  like being in a trap and you cant get out.",
    "Superintendent Battle stirred.",
    "An intelligent gleam showed between\nhis halfclosed lids.",
    "Thats very nicely put he said.",
    "Very nicely put indeed.",
    "It gives me\nan idea ... VI\n\n\fSergeant Jones adroitly got rid of Nevile through the hall and then\nbrought Kay in by the trench window so that husband and wife did not\nmeet.",
    "All the better said Battle.",
    "Its only this one I want to deal with whilst\nshes still in the dark.",
    "The day was overcast with a sharp wind.",
    "Kay was dressed in a tweed\nskirt and a purple sweater above which her hair looked like a\nburnished copper bowl.",
    "She looked half frightened half excited.",
    "Her\nbeauty and vitality bloomed against the dark Victorian background of\nbooks and saddleback chairs.",
    "Leach led her easily enough over her\naccount of the previous evening.",
    "She had had a headache and gone to bed early  about quarterpast\nnine she thought.",
    "She had slept heavily and heard nothing until the\nnext morning when she was wakened by hearing someone screaming.",
    "Battle took up the questioning.",
    "Your husband didnt come in to see how you were before he went off\nfor the evening\n\nNo.",
    "You didnt see him from the time you left the drawingroom until the\nfollowing morning.",
    "Is that right\n\nKay nodded.",
    "Battle stroked his jaw.",
    "Mrs.",
    "Strange the door between your room and that of your husband\nwas locked.",
    "Who locked it\n\nKay said shortly I did.",
    "Battle said nothing  but he waited  waited like an elderly fatherly cat for a mouse to come out of the hole he was watching.",
    "His silence did what questions might not have accomplished.",
    "Kay\nburst out impetuously Oh I suppose youve got to have it all That old\ndoddering Hurstall must have heard us before tea and hell tell you if I\ndont.",
    "Hes probably told you already.",
    "Nevile and I had had a row  a\nflaming row I was furious with him I went up to bed and locked the\ndoor because I was still in a flaming rage with him\n\nI see I see said Battle at his most sympathetic.",
    "And what was the\ntrouble all about\n\nDoes it matter Oh I dont mind telling you.",
    "Nevile has been behaving\nlike a perfect idiot.",
    "Its all that womans fault though.",
    "What woman\n\nHis first wife.",
    "She got him to come here in the first place.",
    "You mean  to meet you\n\n\fYes.",
    "Nevile thinks it was all his own idea  poor innocent But it wasnt.",
    "He never thought of such a thing until he met her in the Park one day\nand she got the idea into his head and made him believe hed thought\nof it himself.",
    "He quite honestly thinks it was his idea but Ive seen\nAudreys fine Italian hand behind it from the first.",
    "Why should she do such a thing asked Battle.",
    "Because she wanted to get hold of him again said Kay.",
    "She spoke\nquickly and her breath came fast.",
    "Shes never forgiven him for going\noff with me.",
    "This is her revenge.",
    "She got him to fix up that wed all be\nhere together and then she got to work on him.",
    "Shes been doing it\never since we arrived.",
    "Shes clever you know.",
    "Knows just how to look\npathetic and elusive  yes and how to play up another man too.",
    "She\ngot Thomas Royde a faithful old dog whos always adored her to be\nhere at the same time and she drove Nevile mad by pretending she\nwas going to marry him.",
    "She stopped breathing angrily.",
    "Battle said mildly I should have thought hed be glad for her to  er find happiness with an old friend.",
    "Glad Hes as jealous as Hell\n\nThen he must be very fond of her.",
    "Oh he is said Kay bitterly.",
    "Shes seen to that\n\nBattles finger still ran dubiously over his jaw.",
    "You might have objected to this arrangement on coming here he\nsuggested.",
    "How could I It would have looked as though I were jealous\n\nWell said Battle after all you were werent you\n\nKay flushed.",
    "Always Ive always been jealous of Audrey.",
    "Right from the beginning\n or nearly the beginning.",
    "I used to feel her there in the house.",
    "It was as\nthough it were her house not mine.",
    "I changed the colour scheme and\ndid it all up but it was no good Id feel her there like a grey ghost\ncreeping about.",
    "I knew Nevile worried because he thought hed\ntreated her badly.",
    "He couldnt quite forget about her she was always\nthere  a reproachful feeling at the back of his mind.",
    "There are people\nyou know who are like that.",
    "They seem rather colourless and not very\ninteresting  but they make themselves felt.",
    "Battle nodded thoughtfully.",
    "He said Well thank you Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "Thats all at present.",
    "We have to ask  er  a good many questions especially with your husband inheriting so much money from Lady\nTressilian  fifty thousand pounds \n\nIs it as much as that We get it from old Sir Matthews will dont we\nYou know all about it\n\nOh yes.",
    "He left it to be divided between Nevile and Neviles wife after\nLady Tressilians death.",
    "Not that Im glad the old thing is dead.",
    "Im not.",
    "I didnt like her very much  probably because she didnt like me  but\nits too horrible to think of some burglar coming along and cracking\nher head open.",
    "She went out on that.",
    "Battle looked at Leach.",
    "What do you think of her Goodlooking bit of goods I will say.",
    "A man\ncould lose his head over her easy enough.",
    "Leach agreed.",
    "Doesnt seem to me quite a lady though he said\ndubiously.",
    "They arent nowadays said Battle.",
    "Shall we see No.",
    "1 No I think\nwell have Miss Aldin next and get an outside angle on this matrimonial\nbusiness.",
    "Mary Aldin came in composedly and sat down.",
    "Beneath her outward\ncalmness her eyes looked worried.",
    "She answered Leachs questions clearly enough confirming Neviles\naccount of the evening.",
    "She had come up to bed about ten oclock.",
    "Mr.",
    "Strange was then with Lady Tressilian Yes I could hear them\ntalking.",
    "Talking Miss Aldin or quarrelling\n\nShe flushed but answered quietly Lady Tressilian you know was\nfond of discussion.",
    "She often sounded acrimonious when she was\nreally nothing of the kind.",
    "Also she was inclined to be autocratic and\nto domineer over people  and a man doesnt take that kind of thing as\neasily as a woman does.",
    "As you do perhaps thought Battle.",
    "He looked at her intelligent face.",
    "It was she who broke the silence.",
    "I dont want to be stupid  but it really seems to me incredible quite\nincredible that you should suspect one of the people in this house.",
    "Why shouldnt it be an outsider\n\nFor several reasons Miss Aldin.",
    "For one thing nothing was taken and\nno entry was forced.",
    "I neednt remind you of the geography of your\nown house and grounds but just bear this in mind.",
    "On the west is a\nsheer cliff down to the sea to the south are a couple of terraces with a\nwall and a drop to the sea on the east the garden slopes down almost\nto the shore but it is surrounded by a high wall.",
    "The only ways out are\na small door leading through on to the road which was found bolted\ninside as usual this morning and the main door to the house which is\nset on the road.",
    "Im not saying no one could climb that wall nor that\nthey could not have got in by using a spare key to the front door or\neven a skeleton key  but Im saying that as far as I can see no one did\nanything of the sort.",
    "Whoever committed this crime knew that Barrett\ntook senna pod decoction every night and doped it  that means\nsomeone in the house.",
    "The niblick was taken from the cupboard under\nthe stairs.",
    "It wasnt an outsider Miss Aldin.",
    "It wasnt Nevile Im sure it wasnt Nevile\n\nWhy are you so sure\n\nShe raised her hands hopelessly.",
    "It just isnt like him  thats why He wouldnt kill a defenceless old\nwoman in bed  Nevile\n\nIt doesnt seem very likely said Battle reasonably but youd be\nsurprised at the things people do when theyve got a good enough\nreason.",
    "Mr.",
    "Strange may have wanted money very badly.",
    "Im sure he didnt.",
    "Hes not an extravagant person  he never has\nbeen.",
    "No but his wife is.",
    "Kay Yes perhaps  but oh its too ridiculous.",
    "Im sure the last thing\nNevile has been thinking of lately is money.",
    "Superintendent Battle coughed.",
    "Kay told you I suppose Yes it really has been rather difficult.",
    "Still\nits nothing to do with this dreadful business.",
    "Probably not but all the same Id like to hear your version of the\naffair Miss Aldin.",
    "Mary said slowly Well as I say it has created a difficult  situation.",
    "Whosoevers idea it was to begin with \n\nHe interrupted her deftly.",
    "I understood it was Mr. Nevile Stranges idea\n\nHe said it was.",
    "But you yourself didnt think so\n\nI  no  it isnt like Nevile somehow.",
    "Ive had a feeling all along that\nsomebody else put the idea into his head.",
    "Mrs. Audrey Strange perhaps\n\nIt seems incredible that Audrey should do such a thing.",
    "Then who else could it have been\n\nMary raised her shoulders helplessly.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Its just  queer.",
    "Queer said Battle thoughtfully.",
    "Thats what I feel about this case.",
    "Its queer.",
    "Everythings been queer.",
    "Theres been a feeling I cant describe it.",
    "Something in the air.",
    "A menace.",
    "Everybody strung up and on edge\n\nYes just that ... Weve all suffered from it.",
    "Even Mr. Latimer  She\nstopped.",
    "I was just coming to Mr. Latimer.",
    "What can you tell me Miss Aldin\nabout Mr. Latimer Who is Mr. Latimer\n\n\fWell really I dont know much about him.",
    "Hes a friend of Kays.",
    "Hes Mrs. Stranges friend.",
    "Known each other a long time\n\nYes she knew him before her marriage.",
    "Mr.",
    "Strange like him\n\nQuite well I believe.",
    "No  trouble there\n\nBattle put it delicately.",
    "Mary replied at once and emphatically\nCertainly not\n\nDid Lady Tressilian like Mr. Latimer\n\nNot very much.",
    "Battle took warning from the aloof tone of her voice and changed the\nsubject.",
    "This maid now Jane Barren she has been with Lady Tressilian a\nlong time You consider her trustworthy\n\nOh absolutely.",
    "She was devoted to Lady Tressilian.",
    "Battle leaned\nback in his chair.",
    "In fact you wouldnt consider for a moment the possibility that Barrett\nhit Lady Tressilian over the head and then doped herself to avoid being\nsuspected\n\nOf course not.",
    "Why on earth should she\n\nShe gets a legacy you know.",
    "So do I said Mary Aldin.",
    "She looked at him steadily.",
    "Yes said Battle.",
    "So do you.",
    "Do you know how much\n\nMr. Trelawny has just arrived.",
    "He told me.",
    "You didnt know about it beforehand\n\nNo.",
    "I certainly assumed from what Lady Tressilian occasionally let\nfall that she had left me something.",
    "I have very little of my own you\nknow.",
    "Not enough to live on without getting work of some kind.",
    "I\nthought that Lady Tressilian would leave me at least a hundred a year but she has some cousins and I did not at all know how she proposed\nto leave that money which was hers to dispose of.",
    "I knew of course\nthat Sir Matthews estate went to Nevile and Audrey.",
    "So she didnt know what Lady Tressilian was leaving her Leach said\nwhen Mary Aldin had been dismissed.",
    "At least thats what she says.",
    "Thats what she says agreed Battle.",
    "And now for Bluebeards first\nwife.",
    "VII\n\nAudrey was wearing a pale grey flannel coat and skirt.",
    "In it she looked\nso pale and ghostlike that Battle was reminded of Kays words A grey\nghost creeping about the house.",
    "She answered his questions simply and without any signs of emotion.",
    "Yes she had gone to bed at ten oclock the same time as Miss Aldin.",
    "She had heard nothing during the night.",
    "Youll excuse me butting into your private affairs said Battle but\nwill you explain just how it comes about that you are here in the\nhouse\n\nI always come to stay at this time.",
    "This year my  my late husband\nwanted to come at the same time and asked me if I would mind.",
    "It was his suggestion\n\nOh yes.",
    "Not yours\n\nOh no.",
    "But you agreed\n\n\fYes I agreed ...",
    "I didnt feel  that I could very well refuse.",
    "Why not Mrs.",
    "Strange\n\nBut she was vague.",
    "One doesnt like to be disobliging.",
    "You were the injured party\n\nI beg your pardon\n\nIt was you who divorced your husband\n\nYes.",
    "Do you  excuse me  feel any rancour against him\n\nNo not at all.",
    "178\n\nYou have a very forgiving nature Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "She did not answer.",
    "He tried silence  but Audrey was not Kay to be\nthus goaded into speech.",
    "She could remain silent without any hint of\nuneasiness.",
    "Battle acknowledged himself beaten.",
    "You are sure it was not your idea  this meeting\n\nQuite sure.",
    "You are on friendly terms with Ihe present Mrs.",
    "Strange\n\nI dont think she likes me very much.",
    "Do you like her\n\nYes.",
    "I think she is very beautiful.",
    "Well  thank you I think that is all.",
    "She got up and walked towards the door.",
    "Then she hesitated and came\nback.",
    "I would just like to say  She spoke nervously and quickly.",
    "You think\nNevile did this  that he killed her because of the money.",
    "Im quite sure\nthat isnt so.",
    "Nevile has never cared much about money.",
    "I do know\nthat.",
    "I was married to him for eight years you know.",
    "I just cant see him\nkilling anyone like that for money  it it  isnt Nevile.",
    "I know my saying\nso isnt of any value as evidence  but I do wish you would believe it.",
    "She turned and hurried out of the room.",
    "And what do you make of her asked Leach.",
    "Ive never seen anyone\nso  so devoid of emotion.",
    "She didnt show any said Battle.",
    "But its there.",
    "Some very strong\nemotion.",
    "And I dont know what it is ...\n\nVIII\n\n\fThomas Royde came last.",
    "He sat solemn and stiff blinking a little like\nan owl.",
    "He was home from Malaya  first time for eight years.",
    "Had been in the\nhabit of staying at Gulls Point ever since he was a boy.",
    "Mrs. Audrey\nStrange was a distant cousin  and had been brought up by his family\nfrom the age of nine.",
    "On the preceding night he had gone to bed just\nbefore eleven.",
    "Yes he had heard Mr. Nevile Strange leave the house\nbut had not seen him.",
    "Nevile had left at about twentypast ten or\nperhaps a little later.",
    "He himself had heard nothing during the night.",
    "He was up and in the garden when the discovery of Lady Tressilians\nbody had been made.",
    "He was an early riser.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Miss Aldin has told us that there was a state of tension in the house.",
    "Did you notice this too\n\nI dont think so.",
    "Dont notice things much.",
    "Thats a lie thought Battle to himself.",
    "You notice a good deal I\nshould say more than most.",
    "No he didnt think Nevile Strange had been short of money in any way.",
    "He certainly had not seemed to.",
    "But he knew very little about Mr.\nStranges affairs.",
    "How well did you know the second Mrs.",
    "Strange I met her here for\nthe first time.",
    "Battle played his last card.",
    "You may know Mr. Royde that weve found Mr. Nevile Stranges\nfingerprints on the weapon.",
    "And weve found blood on the sleeve of the\ncoat he wore last night.",
    "He paused.",
    "Royde nodded.",
    "He was telling us he muttered.",
    "Im asking you frankly Do you think he did it\n\nThomas Royde never liked to be hurried.",
    "He waited for a minute which is a very long time  before he answered Dont see why you ask\nme.",
    "Not my business.",
    "Its yours.",
    "Should say myself  very unlikely.",
    "Can you think of anyone who seems to you more likely\n\nThomas shook his head.",
    "Only person I think likely cant possibly have\ndone it.",
    "So thats that.",
    "And who is that\n\nBut Royde shook his head more decidedly.",
    "Couldnt possibly say.",
    "Only my private opinion.",
    "Its your duty to assist the police.",
    "Tell you any facts.",
    "This isnt facts.",
    "Just an idea.",
    "And its impossible\nanyway.",
    "We didnt get much out of him said Leach when Royde had gone.",
    "Battle agreed.",
    "No we didnt.",
    "Hes got something in his mind  something quite\ndefinite.",
    "Id like to know what it is.",
    "This is a very peculiar sort of crime\nJim my boy \n\nThe telephone rang before Leach could answer.",
    "He took up the\nreceiver and spoke.",
    "After a minute or two of listening he said Good\nand slammed it down.",
    "Blood on the coat sleeve is human he announced.",
    "Same blood group as Lady Ts.",
    "Looks as though Nevile Strange is for\nit \n\nBattle had walked over to the window and was looking out with\nconsiderable interest.",
    "A beautiful young man out there he remarked.",
    "Quite beautiful and a\ndefinite wrong un I should say.",
    "Its a pity Mr. Latimer  for I feel that\nthats Mr. Latimer was over at Easterhead Bay last night.",
    "Hes the type\nthat would smash in his own grandmothers head if he thought he\ncould get away with it and if he knew hed make something out of it.",
    "Well there wasnt anything in it for him said Leach.",
    "Lady Ts death\ndoesnt benefit him in any way whatever.",
    "The telephone bell rang\nagain.",
    "Damn this phone whats the matter now\n\n\fHe went to it.",
    "Hullo.",
    "Oh its you doctor.",
    "What Come round has she What\nWhat\n\nHe turned his head.",
    "Uncle just come and listen to this.",
    "Battle came over and took the phone.",
    "He listened his face as usual\nshowing no expression.",
    "He said to Leach Get Nevile Strange Jim.",
    "When Nevile came in Battle was just replacing the phone on its hook.",
    "Nevile looking white and spent stared curiously at the Scotland Yard\nsuperintendent trying to read the emotion behind the wooden mask.",
    "Mr.",
    "Strange said Battle.",
    "Do you know anyone who dislikes you very\nmuch Nevile stared and shook his head.",
    "Sure Battle was impressive.",
    "I mean sir someone who does more\nthan dislike you  someone who  frankly  hates your guts\n\nNevile sat bolt upright.",
    "No.",
    "No certainly not.",
    "Nothing of the kind.",
    "Think Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Is there no one youve injured in any way  Nevile\nflushed.",
    "Theres only one person I can be said to have injured and shes not\nthe kind who bears rancour.",
    "Thats my first wife when I left her for\nanother woman.",
    "But I can assure you that she doesnt hate me.",
    "Shes shes been an angel.",
    "The Superintendent leaned forward across the table.",
    "Let me tell you Mr.",
    "Strange youre a very lucky man.",
    "I dont say I\nliked the case against you I didnt.",
    "But it was a case It would have\nstood up all right and unless the jury happened to have liked your\npersonality it would have hanged you.",
    "You speak said Nevile as though all that were past.",
    "It is past said Battle.",
    "Youve been saved Mr.",
    "Strange by pure\nchance.",
    "Nevile still looked inquiringly at him.",
    "After you left her last night said Battle Lady Tressilian rang the bell\nfor her maid.",
    "He watched whilst Nevile took it in.",
    "After.",
    "Then Barrett saw her \n\nYes.",
    "Alive and well.",
    "Barrett also saw you leave the house before she\nwent in to her mistress.",
    "Nevile said But the niblick  my fingerprints \n\n\fShe wasnt hit with that niblick.",
    "Dr. Lazenby didnt like it all the time.",
    "I\nsaw that.",
    "She was killed with something else.",
    "That niblick was put\nthere deliberately to throw suspicion on you.",
    "It may be by someone\nwho overheard the quarrel and so selected you as a suitable victim or\nit may be because \n\nHe paused arid then repeated his question Who is there in this\nhouse that hates you Mr.",
    "Strange\n\nIX\n\nIve got a question for you doctor said Battle.",
    "They were in the doctors house after returning from the nursing home\nwhere they had had a short interview with Jane Barrett.",
    "Barrett was weak and exhausted but quite clear in her statement.",
    "She had just been getting into bed after drinking her senna when Lady\nTressilians bell had wrung.",
    "She had glanced at the dock and seen the\ntime twentyfive minutes past ten.",
    "She had put on her dressinggown and come down.",
    "She had heard a\nnoise in the hall below and had looked over the balusters.",
    "It was Mr. Nevile just going out.",
    "He was taking his raincoat down from\nthe hook.",
    "What suit was he wearing\n\n\fHis grey pinstripe.",
    "His face was very worried and unhappylooking.",
    "He shoved his arms into his coat as though he didnt care how he put it\non.",
    "Then he went out and banged the front door behind him.",
    "I went on\nin to Her Ladyship.",
    "She was very drowsy poor dear and couldnt\nremember why she had rung for me  she couldnt always poor lady.",
    "But I beat up her pillows and brought her a fresh glass of water and\nsettled her comfortably.",
    "She didnt seem upset or afraid of anything\n\nJust tired thats all.",
    "I was tired myself.",
    "Yawning.",
    "I went up and went\nright off to sleep.",
    "That was Barretts story and it seemed impossible to doubt her\ngenuine grief and horror at the news of her mistresss death.",
    "They went back to Lazenbys house and it was then that Battle\nannounced that he had a question to ask.",
    "Ask away said Lazenby.",
    "What time do you think Lady Tressilian died\n\nIve told you.",
    "Between ten oclock and midnight.",
    "I know thats what you said.",
    "But it wasnt my question.",
    "I asked you\nwhat you personally thought.",
    "Off the record eh\n\n\fYes.",
    "All right.",
    "My guess would be in the neighbourhood of eleven oclock.",
    "Thats what I wanted you to say said Battle.",
    "Glad to oblige.",
    "Why\n\nNever did like the idea of her being killed before tentwenty.",
    "Take\nBarretts sleepingdraught  it wouldnt have got to work by then.",
    "That\nsleepingdraught shows that the murder was meant to be committed a\ngood deal later  during the night.",
    "Id prefer midnight myself.",
    "Could be.",
    "Eleven is only a guess.",
    "But it definitely couldnt be later than midnight\n\nNo.",
    "It couldnt be after 2.30\n\nGood heavens no.",
    "Well that seems to let Strange out all right.",
    "Ill just have to check up\non his movements after he left the house.",
    "If hes telling the truth hes\nwashed out and we can go on to our other suspects.",
    "The other people who inherit money suggested Leach.",
    "Maybe said Battle.",
    "But somehow I dont think so.",
    "Someone with a\nkink Im looking for.",
    "A kink\n\nA nasty kink.",
    "When they left the doctors house they went on to the ferry.",
    "The ferry\nconsisted of a rowing boat operated by two brothers Will and George\nBarnes.",
    "The Barnes brothers knew everybody in Saltcreek by sight\nand most of the people who came over from Easterhead Bay.",
    "George\nsaid at once that Mr.",
    "Strange from Gulls Point had gone across at\n10.30 on the preceding night.",
    "No he had not brought Mr.",
    "Strange back\nagain.",
    "Last ferry had gone at 1.30 from the Easterhead side and Mr.",
    "Strange wasnt on it.",
    "Battle asked him if he knew Mr. Latimer.",
    "Latimer Latimer Tall handsome young gentleman Comes over\nfrom the hotel up to Gulls Point Yes I know him.",
    "Didnt see him at all\nlast night though.",
    "Hes been over this morning.",
    "Went back last trip.",
    "They crossed on the ferry and went up to the Easterhead Bay Hotel.",
    "Here they found Mr. Latimer newly returned from the other side.",
    "He\nhad crossed on the ferry before theirs.",
    "Mr. Latimer was very anxious to do all he could to help.",
    "Yes old Nevile came over last night.",
    "Looked very blue over\nsomething.",
    "Told me hed had a row with the old lady.",
    "I hear hed fallen\nout with Kay too but he didnt tell me that of course.",
    "Anyway he was\na bit down in the mouth.",
    "Seemed quite glad of my company for once in\na way.",
    "He wasnt able to find you at once I understand\n\nLatimer said sharply Dont know why.",
    "I was sitting in the lounge.",
    "Strange said he looked in and didnt see me but he wasnt in a state to\nconcentrate.",
    "Or I may have strolled out into the gardens for five\nminutes or so.",
    "Always get out when I can.",
    "Beastly smell in this hotel.",
    "Noticed it last night in the bar.",
    "Drains I think Strange mentioned it\ntoo We both smelt it.",
    "Nasty decayed smell.",
    "Might be a dead rat under\nthe billiardroom floor.",
    "You played billiards and after your game\n\nOh we talked a bit had another drink or two.",
    "Then Nevile said Hullo\nIve missed the ferry\u2019 so I said Id get out my car and drive him back\nwhich I did.",
    "We got there about 2.30.",
    "And Mr.",
    "Strange was with you all the evening\n\nOh yes.",
    "Ask anybody.",
    "Theyll tell you.",
    "Thank you Mr. Latimer.",
    "We have to be so careful.",
    "Leach said as they left the smiling selfpossessed young man Whats\nthe idea of checking up so carefully on Nevile Strange\n\n\fBattle smiled.",
    "Leach got it suddenly.",
    "Good Lord its the other one youre checking up on.",
    "So thats your\nidea.",
    "Its too soon to have ideas said Battle.",
    "Ive just got to know exactly\nwhere Mr. Ted Latimer was last night.",
    "We know that from quarterpast\neleven say  to after midnight  he was with Nevile Strange.",
    "But where\nwas he before that when Strange arrived and couldnt find him\n\nThey pursued their inquiries doggedly  with bar attendants waiters\nlift boys.",
    "Latimer had been seen in the lounge between nine and ten.",
    "He had been in the bar at a quarterpast ten.",
    "But between that time\nand eleventwenty he seemed to have been singularly elusive.",
    "Then\none of the maids was found who declared that Mr. Latimer had been in\none of the small writing rooms with Mrs. Beddoes thats the fat North\nCountry lady.",
    "That tears it said Battle gloomily.",
    "He was here all right.",
    "Just didnt\nwant attention drawn to his fat and no doubt rich lady friend.",
    "That\nthrows us back on those others  the servants Kay Strange Audrey\nStrange Mary Aldin and Thomas Royde.",
    "One of them killed the old\nlady but which If we could find the real weapon \n\nHe stopped then slapped his thigh.",
    "Got it Jim my boy I know now what made me think of Hercule Poirot.",
    "Well have a spot of lunch and go back to Gulls Point and Ill show you\nsomething.",
    "X\n\nMary Aldin was restless.",
    "She went in and out of the house picked off a\ndead dahlia head here and there went back into the drawingroom\nand shifted flower vases in an unmeaning fashion.",
    "From the library came a vague murmur of voices.",
    "Mr. Trelawny was in\nthere with Nevile.",
    "Kay and Audrey were nowhere to be seen.",
    "Mary went out in the garden again.",
    "Down by the wall she spied Thomas\nRoyde placidly smoking.",
    "She went and joined him.",
    "Oh dear.",
    "She sat down beside him with a deep perplexed sigh.",
    "Anything the matter Thomas asked.",
    "Mary laughed with a slight note of hysteria in the laugh.",
    "Nobody but you would say a thing like that.",
    "A murder in the house and\nyou just say Is anything the matter\n\nLooking a little surprised Thomas said I meant anything fresh\n\nOh I know what you meant.",
    "Its really a wonderful relief to find anyone\nso gloriously justthesameasusual as you are\n\nNot much good is it getting all het up over things 188\n\n\fNo no.",
    "Youre eminently sensible.",
    "Its how you manage to do it beats\nme.",
    "Well I suppose Im an outsider.",
    "Thats true of course.",
    "You cant fed the relief all the rest of .us do that\nNevile is cleared.",
    "Im very pleased he is of course said Royde.",
    "Mary shuddered.",
    "It was a very near thing.",
    "If Camilla hadnt taken it into her head to ring\nthe bell for Barrett after Nevile had left her \n\nThen old Nevile would have been for it all right.",
    "He spoke with a certain grim satisfaction then shook his head with a\nslight smile as he met Marys reproachful gaze.",
    "Im not really heartless but now that Neviles all right I cant help\nbeing pleased he had a bit of a shaking up.",
    "Hes always so damned\ncomplacent.",
    "He isnt really Thomas.",
    "Perhaps not.",
    "Its just his manner.",
    "Anyway he was looking scared as\nHell this morning\n\nWhat a cruel streak you have\n\nAnyway its all right now.",
    "You know Mary even here Nevile has had\nthe devils own luck.",
    "Some other poor beggar with all that evidence\npiled up against him mightnt have had such a break.",
    "Mary shivered again.",
    "Dont say that.",
    "I like to think the innocent are protected.",
    "Do you my dear His voice was gentle.",
    "Mary burst out suddenly Thomas Im worried.",
    "Im frightfully\nworried.",
    "Yes.",
    "Its about Mr. Treves.",
    "Thomas dropped his pipe on the stones.",
    "His voice changed as he bent\nto pick it up.",
    "What about Mr. Treves\n\nThat night he was here  that story he told  about a little murderer\nIve been wondering Thomas ... Was it just a story Or did he tell it\nwith a purpose\n\nYou mean said Royde deliberately was it aimed at someone who\nwas in the room\n\nMary whispered Yes.",
    "Thomas said quietly Ive been wondering too.",
    "As a matter of fact\nthat was what I was thinking about when you came along just now.",
    "Mary halfclosed her eyes.",
    "Ive been trying to remember ...",
    "He told it you know so very\ndeliberately.",
    "He almost dragged it into the conversation.",
    "And he said\nhe would recognise the person anywhere.",
    "He emphasised that.",
    "As\nthough he had recognised him.",
    "Mm said Thomas.",
    "Ive been through all that.",
    "But why should he do it What was the point\n\nI suppose said Royde it was a kind of warning.",
    "Not to try anything\non.",
    "You mean that Mr. Treves knew that Camilla was going to be\nmurdered\n\nNo  o. I think thats too fantastic.",
    "It may have been just a general\nwarning.",
    "What Ive been wondering is do you think we ought to tell the police\nTo that Thomas again gave his thoughtful consideration.",
    "I think not he said at last.",
    "I dont see that its relevant in any way.",
    "Its not as though Treves were alive and could tell them anything.",
    "No said Mary.",
    "Hes dead She gave a quick shiver.",
    "Its so odd\nThomas the way he died.",
    "Heart attack.",
    "He had a bad heart.",
    "I mean that curious business about the lift being out of order.",
    "I dont\nlike it.",
    "I dont like it very much myself said Thomas Royde.",
    "XI\n\nSuperintendent Battle looked round the bedroom.",
    "The bed had been\nmade.",
    "Otherwise the room was unchanged.",
    "It had been neat when\nthey first looked round it.",
    "It was neat now.",
    "Thats it said Superintendent Battle pointing to the oldfashioned\nsteel fender.",
    "Do you see anything odd about that fender\n\nMust take some cleaning said Jim Leach.",
    "Its well kept.",
    "Nothing\nodd about it that I can see except  yes the lefthand knob is brighter\nthan the righthand one.",
    "Thats what put Hercule Poirot into my head said Battle.",
    "You know\nhis fad about things not being quite symmetrical  gets him all worked\nup.",
    "I suppose I thought unconsciously \u2018That would worry old Poirot\nand then I began talking about him.",
    "Get your fingerprint kit Jones\nwell have a look at those two knobs.",
    "Jones reported presently.",
    "There are prints on the righthand knob\nsir none on the left.",
    "Its the left one we want then.",
    "Those other prints are the housemaids\nwhen she last cleaned it.",
    "The lefthand one has been cleaned since.",
    "There was a bit of screwedup emery paper in this wastepaper\nbasket volunteered Jones.",
    "I didnt think it meant anything.",
    "Because you didnt know what you were looking for then.",
    "Gently now\nIll bet anything you like that knob unscrews  yes I thought so.",
    "Presently Jones held the knob up.",
    "Its a good weight he said weighing it in his hands.",
    "Leach bending over it said Theres something dark  on the screw.",
    "Blood as likely as not said Battle.",
    "Cleaned the knob itself and\nwiped it and that little stain on the screw wasnt noticed.",
    "Ill bet\nanything you like thats the weapon that caved the old ladys skull in.",
    "But theres more to find.",
    "Its up to you Jones to search the house\nagain.",
    "This time youll know exactly what youre looking for.",
    "He gave a few swift detailed instructions.",
    "Going to the window he put\nhis head out.",
    "Theres something yellow tucked into the ivy.",
    "That may be another\npiece of the puzzle.",
    "I rather think it is.",
    "XII\n\nCrossing the hall.",
    "Superintendent Battle was waylaid by Mary Aldin.",
    "Can I speak to you a minute.",
    "Superintendent\n\n\fCertainly Miss Aldin.",
    "Shall we come in here\n\nHe threw open the diningroom door.",
    "Lunch had been cleared away by\nHurstall.",
    "I want to ask you something Superintendent.",
    "Surely you dont you\ncant still think that this  this awful crime was done by one of us It\nmust have been someone from outside Some maniac\n\nYou may not be far wrong there.",
    "Miss Aldin.",
    "Maniac is a word that\ndescribes this criminal very well if Im not mistaken.",
    "But not an\noutsider.",
    "Her eyes opened very wide.",
    "Do you mean that someone in this house is  is mad\n\nYoure thinking said the Superintendent of someone foaming at the\nmouth and rolling their eyes.",
    "Mania isnt like that.",
    "Some of the most\ndangerous criminal lunatics have looked as sane as you or I.",
    "Its a\nquestion usually of having an obsession.",
    "One idea preying on the\nmind gradually distorting it.",
    "Pathetic reasonable people who come up\nto you and explain how theyre being persecuted and how everyone is\nspying on them  and you sometimes feel it must all be true.",
    "Im sure nobody here has any idea of being persecuted.",
    "I only gave that as an instance.",
    "There are other forms of insanity.",
    "But I\nbelieve whoever committed this crime was under the domination of\n\n\fone fixed idea  an idea on which they had brooded until literally\nnothing else mattered or had any importance.",
    "Mary shivered.",
    "She said Theres something I think you ought to\nknow.",
    "Concisely and clearly she told him of Mr. Treves visit to dinner and of\nthe story he had told.",
    "Superintendent Battle was deeply interested.",
    "He said he could recognise this person Man or woman  by the way\n\nI took it that it was a boy the story was about  but its true Mr. Treves\ndidnt actually say so  in fact I remember now  he distinctly stated he\nwould not give any particulars as to sex or age.",
    "Did he Rather significant perhaps.",
    "And he said there was a definite\nphysical peculiarity by which he could be sure of knowing this child\nanywhere\n\nYes.",
    "A scar perhaps  has anybody here got a scar\n\nHe noticed the faint hesitation before Mary Aldin replied Not that I\nhave noticed.",
    "Come now.",
    "Miss Aldin he smiled.",
    "You have noticed something.",
    "If\nso dont you think that I shall be able to notice it too\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "I I havent noticed anything of the kind.",
    "But he saw that she was startled and upset.",
    "His words had obviously\nsuggested a very unpleasant train of thought to her.",
    "He wished he\nknew just what it was but his experience made him aware that to\npress her at this minute would not yield any result.",
    "He brought the conversation back to old Mr. Treves.",
    "Mary told him of\nthe tragic sequel to the evening.",
    "Battle questioned her at some length.",
    "Then he said quietly Thats a\nnew one on me.",
    "Never come across that before.",
    "What do you mean\n\nIve never come across a murder committed by the simple expedient\nof hanging a placard on a lift.",
    "She looked horrified.",
    "You dont really think \n\nThat it was murder Of course it was Quick resourceful murder.",
    "It\nmight not have come off of course  but it did come off.",
    "Just because Mr. Treves knew \n\nYes.",
    "Because he would have been able to direct our attention to one\nparticular person in this house.",
    "As it is weve started in the dark.",
    "But\nweve got a glimmer of light now and every minute the case is getting\nclearer.",
    "Ill tell you this.",
    "Miss Aldin this murder was very carefully\n\n\fplanned beforehand down to the smallest detail.",
    "And I want to impress\none thing on your mind  dont let anybody know that youve told me\nwhat you have.",
    "That is important.",
    "Dont tell anyone mind.",
    "Mary nodded.",
    "She was still looking dazed.",
    "Superintendent Battle went out of the room and proceeded to do what\nhe had been about to do when Mary Aldin intercepted him.",
    "He was a\nmethodical man.",
    "He wanted certain information and a new and\npromising hare did not distract him from the orderly performance of\nhis duties however tempting this new hare might be.",
    "He tapped on the library door and Nevile Stranges voice called\nCome in.",
    "Battle was introduced to Mr. Trelawny a tall distinguishedlooking\nman with a keen dark eye.",
    "Sorry if I am butting in said Superintendent Battle apologetically.",
    "But theres something I havent got clear.",
    "You Mr.",
    "Strange inherit\nhalf the late Sir Matthews estate but who inherits the other half\n\nNevile looked surprised.",
    "I told you.",
    "My wife.",
    "Yes.",
    "But  Battle coughed in a deprecating manner which wife Mr.",
    "Strange\n\n\fOh I see.",
    "Yes I expressed myself badly.",
    "The money goes to Audrey\nwho was my wife at the time the will was made.",
    "Thats right Mr.\nTrelawny\n\nThe lawyer assented.",
    "The bequest is quite clearly worded.",
    "The estate is to be divided\nbetween Sir Matthews ward Nevile Henry Strange and his wife\nAudrey Elizabeth Strange nee Standish.",
    "The subsequent divorce\nmakes no difference whatever.",
    "Thats clear then said Battle.",
    "I take it Mrs. Audrey Strange is fully\naware of these facts\n\nCertainly said Mr. Trelawny.",
    "And the present Mrs.",
    "Strange\n\nKay Nevile looked slightly surprised.",
    "Oh I suppose so.",
    "At least Ive never talked much about it with her \n\nI think youll find said Battle that shes under a misapprehension.",
    "She thinks that the money on Lady Tressilians death comes to you and\nyour present wife.",
    "At least thats what she gave me to understand this\nmorning.",
    "Thats why I came along to find out how the position really\nlay.",
    "How extraordinary said Nevile.",
    "Still I suppose it might have\nhappened quite easily.",
    "She has said once or twice now that I think\nabout it \u2018We come into that money when Camilla dies\u2019 but I suppose I\nassumed that she was just associating herself with me in my share of\nit.",
    "Its extraordinary said Battle the amount of misunderstandings\nthere are even between two people who discuss a thing quite often both of them assuming different things and neither of them discovering\nthe discrepancy.",
    "I suppose so said Nevile not sounding very interested.",
    "It doesnt\nmatter much in this case anyway.",
    "Its not as though were short of\nmoney at all.",
    "Im very glad for Audrey.",
    "She has been very hard up and\nthis will make a big difference to her.",
    "Battle said bluntly But surely sir at the time of the divorce she was\nentitled to an allowance from you\n\nNevile flushed.",
    "He said in a constrained voice There is such a thing\nas  as pride.",
    "Superintendent.",
    "Audrey has always persistently refused\nto touch a penny of the allowance I wished to make her.",
    "A very generous allowance put in Mr. Trelawny.",
    "But Mrs.",
    "Strange\nhas always returned it and refused to accept it.",
    "Very interesting said Battle and went out before anyone could ask\nhim to elaborate that comment.",
    "He went out and found his nephew.",
    "On its face value he said theres a nice monetary motive for nearly\neverybody in this case.",
    "Nevile Strange and Audrey Strange get a cool\nfifty thousand each.",
    "Kay Strange thinks shes entitled to fifty thousand.",
    "Mary Aldin gets an income that frees her from having to earn her living.",
    "Thomas Royde Im bound to say doesnt gain.",
    "But we can include\nHurstall and even Barrett if we admit that shed take the risk of\nfinishing herself off to avoid suspicion.",
    "Yes as I say there are no lack\nof money motives.",
    "And yet if Im right money doesnt enter into this at\nall.",
    "If theres such a thing as a murder for pure hate this is it.",
    "And if no\none comes along and throws a spanner into the works Im going to get\nthe person who did it\n\nXIII\n\nAngus MacWhirter sat on the terrace of the Easterhead Bay Hotel and\nstared across the river to the frowning height of Stark Head opposite.",
    "He was engaged at the moment in a careful stocktaking of his thoughts\nand emotions.",
    "He hardly knew what it was that had made him choose to spend his\nlast few days of leisure where he now was.",
    "Yet something had drawn\nhim there.",
    "Perhaps the wish to test himself  to see if there remained in\nhis heart any of the old despair.",
    "Mona How little he cared now She was married to the other man.",
    "He\nhad passed her in the street one day without feeling any emotion.",
    "He\ncould remember his grief and bitterness when she left him but they\nwere past now and gone.",
    "He was recalled from these thoughts by an impact of wet dog and the\nfrenzied appeal of a newlymade friend.",
    "Miss Diana Brinton aged\nthirteen.",
    "Oh come away Don.",
    "Come away.",
    "Isnt it awful Hes rolled on some\nfish or something down on the beach.",
    "You can smell him yards away.",
    "The fish was awfully dead you know\n\nMacWhirters nose confirmed this assumption.",
    "In a sort of crevice on the rocks said Miss Brinton.",
    "I took him into\nthe sea and tried to wash it off but it doesnt seem to have done much\ngood.",
    "MacWhirter agreed.",
    "Don a wirehaired terrier of amiable and loving\ndisposition was looking hurt by the tendency of his friends to keep him\nfirmly at arms length.",
    "Sea waters no good said MacWhirter.",
    "Hot water and soaps the\nonly thing.",
    "I know.",
    "But thats not so jolly easy in a hotel.",
    "We havent\ngot a private bath.",
    "In the end MacWhirter and Diana surreptitiously entered by the side\ndoor with Don on a lead and smuggling him up to MacWhirters\nbathroom a thorough cleansing took place and both MacWhirter and\nDiana got very wet.",
    "Don was very sad when it was all over.",
    "That\ndisgusting smell of soap again  just when he had found a really nice\nperfume such as any other dog would envy.",
    "Oh well it was always the\nsame with humans  they had no decent sense of smell.",
    "The little incident had left MacWhirter in a more cheerful mood.",
    "He\ntook the bus into Saltington where he had left a suit to be cleaned.",
    "The girl in charge of the 24Hour Cleaners looked at him vacantly.",
    "MacWhirter did you say Im afraid it isnt ready yet.",
    "It should be.",
    "He had been promised that suit the day before and\neven that would have been 48 and not 24 hours.",
    "A woman might have\nsaid all this.",
    "MacWhirter merely scowled.",
    "Theres not been time yet said the girl smiling indifferently.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "The girl stopped smiling.",
    "She snapped Anyway its not done.",
    "Then Ill take it away as it is said MacWhirter.",
    "Nothings been done to it the girl warned him.",
    "Ill take it away.",
    "I dare say we might get it done by tomorrow as a special favour.",
    "Im not in the habit of asking for special favours.",
    "Just give me the suit\nplease.",
    "Giving him a badtempered look the girl went into the back room.",
    "She\nreturned with a clumsily doneup parcel which she pushed across the\ncounter.",
    "MacWhirter took it and went out.",
    "He felt quite ridiculously as though he had won a victory.",
    "Actually it\nmerely meant that he would have to have the suit cleaned elsewhere\n\nHe threw the parcel on his bed when he returned to the hotel and\nlooked at it with annoyance.",
    "Perhaps he could get it sponged and\npressed in the hotel.",
    "It was not really too bad  perhaps it didnt\nactually need cleaning\n\nHe undid the parcel and gave vent to an expression of annoyance.",
    "Really the 24Hour Cleaners were too inefficient for words.",
    "This\nwasnt his suit.",
    "It wasnt even the same colour It had been a dark blue\nsuit he had left with them.",
    "Impertinent inefficient muddlers.",
    "He glanced irritably at the label.",
    "It had the name MacWhirter all right.",
    "Another MacWhirter Or some stupid interchange of labels\n\nStaring down vexedly at the crumpled heap he suddenly sniffed.",
    "Surely he knew that smell  a particularly unpleasant smell ...\nconnected somehow with a dog.",
    "Yes that was it.",
    "Diana and her dog.",
    "Absolutely and literally stinking fish\n\nHe bent down and examined the suit.",
    "There it was a discoloured patch\non the shoulder of the coat.",
    "On the shoulder \n\nNow that thought MacWhirter is really very curious ...",
    "Anyway next day he would have a few grim words with the girl at the\n24Hour Cleaners.",
    "Gross mismanagement\n\n\fXIV\n\nAfter dinner he strolled out of the hotel and down the road to the ferry.",
    "It was a clear night but cold with a sharp foretaste of winter.",
    "Summer\nwas over.",
    "MacWhirter crossed in the ferry to the Saltcreek side.",
    "It was the\nsecond time that he was revisiting Stark Head.",
    "The place had a\nfascination for him.",
    "He walked slowly up the hill passing the Balmoral\nCourt Hotel and then a big house set on the point of a cliff.",
    "Gulls Point he read the name on the painted door.",
    "Of course that was where the\nold lady had been murdered.",
    "There had been a lot of talk in the hotel\nabout it his chambermaid had insisted on telling him all about it and\nthe newspapers had given it a prominence which had annoyed\nMacWhirter who preferred to read worldwide affairs and who was not\ninterested in crime.",
    "He went on downhill again to skirt a small beach and some oldfashioned fishing cottages that had been modernised.",
    "Then up again\ntill the road ended and petered out into the track that led on up Stark\nHead.",
    "It was grim and forbidding on Stark Head.",
    "MacWhirter stood on the\ncliff edge looking down to the sea.",
    "So he had stood on that other night.",
    "He tried to recapture some of the feeling he had had then  the\ndesperation anger weariness  the longing to be out of it all.",
    "But there\nwas nothing to recapture.",
    "All that had gone.",
    "There was instead a cold\nanger.",
    "Caught on that tree rescued by coastguards fussed over like\na naughty child in hospital a series of indignities and affronts.",
    "Why\ncouldnt he have been let alone He would rather a thousand times\n\n\frather be out of it all.",
    "He still felt that.",
    "The only thing he had lost was\nthe necessary impetus.",
    "How it had hurt him then to think of Mona He could think of her quite\ncalmly now.",
    "She had always been rather a fool.",
    "Easily taken in by\nanyone who flattered her or played up to her idea of herself.",
    "Very\npretty.",
    "Yes very pretty  but no mind not the kind of woman he had\nonce dreamed about.",
    "But that was beauty of course  Some vague fancied picture of a\nwoman flying through the night with white draperies streaming out\nbehind her ... Something like the figurehead of a ship  only not so\nsolid ... not nearly so solid ...\n\nAnd then with dramatic suddenness the incredible happened Out of\nthe night came a flying figure.",
    "One minute she was not there the next\nminute she was  a white figure running  running  to the cliffs edge.",
    "A\nfigure beautiful and desperate driven to destruction by pursuing\nFuries Running with a terrible desperation ...",
    "He knew that\ndesperation.",
    "He knew what it meant ...",
    "He came with a rush out of the shadows and caught her just as she\nwas about to go over the edge\n\nHe said fiercely No you dont ...",
    "It was just like holding a bird.",
    "She struggled  struggled silently and\nthen again like a bird was suddenly still.",
    "He said urgently Dont throw yourself over Nothings worth it.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Even if you are desperately unhappy \n\nShe made a sound.",
    "It was perhaps a faroff ghost of a laugh.",
    "He said sharply Youre not unhappy What is it then\n\nShe answered him at once with the low softlybreathed word\nAfraid.",
    "Afraid He was so astonished that he let her go standing back a\npace to see her better.",
    "He realised then the truth of her words.",
    "It.",
    "was fear that had lent that\nurgency to her footsteps.",
    "It was fear that made her small white\nintelligent face blank and stupid.",
    "Fear that dilated those wideapart\neyes.",
    "He said incredulously What are you afraid of\n\nShe replied so low that he hardly heard it Im afraid of being hanged\n...",
    "Yes she had said just that.",
    "He stared and stared.",
    "He looked from her\nto the cliffs edge.",
    "So thats why\n\nYes.",
    "A quick death instead of \n\n\fShe closed her eyes and shivered.",
    "She went on shivering.",
    "MacWhirter was piecing things together logically in his mind.",
    "He said at last Lady Tressilian The old lady who was murdered.",
    "Then accusingly Youll be Mrs.",
    "Strange  the first Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "Still shivering she nodded her head.",
    "MacWhirter went on in his slow careful voice trying to remember all\nthat he had heard.",
    "Rumour had been incorporated with fact.",
    "They detained your husband  thats right isnt it A lot of evidence\nagainst him  and then they found that the evidence had been faked by\nsomeone ...",
    "He stopped and looked at her.",
    "She wasnt shivering any longer.",
    "She\nwas just standing looking at him like a docile child.",
    "He found her\nattitude unendurably affecting.",
    "His voice went on I see ...",
    "Yes I see how it was ...",
    "He left you for\nanother woman didnt he And you loved him ... Thats why  He\nbroke off.",
    "He said I understand.",
    "My wife left me for another man ...\n\nShe flung out her arms.",
    "She began stammering wildly hopelessly Its\nnnnot its nnnot llike that.",
    "Nnot at all \n\nHe cut her short.",
    "His voice was stern and commanding Go home.",
    "You\nneednt be afraid any longer.",
    "Dyou hear Ill see that youre not\nhanged\n\n\fXV\n\nMary Aldin was lying on the drawingroom sofa.",
    "Her head ached and\nher whole body felt worn out.",
    "The inquest had taken place the day before and after formal evidence\nof identification had been adjourned for a week.",
    "Lady Tressilians funeral was to take place on the morrow.",
    "Audrey and\nKay had gone into Saltington in the car to get some black clothes.",
    "Ted\nLatimer had gone with them.",
    "Nevile and Thomas Royde had gone for a\nwalk so except for the servants Mary was alone in the house.",
    "Superintendent Battle and Inspector Leach had been absent today\nand that too was a relief.",
    "It seemed to Mary that with their absence a\nshadow had been lifted.",
    "They had been polite quite pleasant in fact\nbut the ceaseless questions that quiet deliberate probing and sifting\nof every fact was the sort of thing that wore hardly on the nerves.",
    "By\nnow that woodenfaced Superintendent must have learned of every\nincident every word every gesture even of the past ten days.",
    "Now with their going there was peace.",
    "Mary let herself relax.",
    "She\nwould forget everything  everything.",
    "Just lie back and rest.",
    "Excuse me Madam \n\nIt was Hurstall in the doorway looking apologetic.",
    "A gentleman wishes to see you.",
    "I have put him in the study.",
    "Mary looked at him in astonishment and some annoyance.",
    "Who is it\n\nHe gave his name as Mr. MacWhirter Miss.",
    "Ive never heard of him.",
    "No Miss.",
    "He must be a reporter.",
    "You shouldnt have let him in Hurstall.",
    "Hurstall coughed.",
    "I dont think he is a reporter Miss.",
    "I think he is a friend of Miss\nAudreys.",
    "Oh thats different.",
    "Smoothing her hair Mary went wearily across the hall and into the\nsmall study.",
    "She was somehow a little surprised as the tall man\nstanding by the window turned.",
    "He did not look in the least like a friend\nof Audreys.",
    "However she said pleasantly Im sorry Mrs.",
    "Strange is out.",
    "You\nwanted to see her.",
    "He looked at her in a thoughtful considering way.",
    "Youll be Miss Aldin be said.",
    "Yes.",
    "I dare say you can help me just as well.",
    "I want to find some rope.",
    "Rope said Mary in lively amazement.",
    "Yes rope.",
    "Where would you be likely to keep a piece of rope\n\nAfterwards Mary considered that she had been halfhypnotised.",
    "If this\nstrange man had volunteered any explanation she might have resisted.",
    "But Andrew MacWhirter unable to think of a plausible explanation\ndecided very wisely to do without one.",
    "He just stated quite simply\nwhat he wanted.",
    "She found herself semidazed leading MacWhirter in\nsearch of rope.",
    "What kind of rope she had asked.",
    "And he had replied Any rope will do.",
    "She said doubtfully Perhaps in the potting shed \n\nShall we go there\n\nShe led the way.",
    "There was twine and an odd bit of cord but\nMacWhirter shook his head.",
    "He wanted rope  a goodsized coil of rope.",
    "Theres the boxroom\nsaid Mary hesitatingly.",
    "Ay that might be the place.",
    "They went indoors and upstairs.",
    "Mary threw open the boxroom door.",
    "MacWhirter stood in the doorway looking in.",
    "He gave a curious sigh of\ncontentment.",
    "There it is he said.",
    "There was a big coil of rope lying on a chest just inside the door in\ncompany with old fishing tackle and some motheaten cushions.",
    "He\nlaid a hand on her arm and impelled Mary gently forward until they\nstood looking down on the rope.",
    "He touched it and said Id like you to\ncharge your memory with this.",
    "Miss Aldin.",
    "Youll notice that everything\nround about is covered with dust.",
    "Theres no dust on this rope.",
    "Just\nfeel it.",
    "She said It feels slightly damp in a surprised tone.",
    "Just so.",
    "He turned to go out again.",
    "But the rope I thought you wanted it said Mary in surprise.",
    "MacWhirter smiled.",
    "I just wanted to know it was there.",
    "Thats all.",
    "Perhaps you wouldnt\nmind locking this door.",
    "Miss Aldin  and taking the key out Yes.",
    "Id be\nobliged if youd hand the key to Superintendent Battle or Inspector\nLeach.",
    "It would be best in their keeping.",
    "As they went downstairs Mary made an effort to rally herself.",
    "She protested as they reached the main hall But really I dont\nunderstand.",
    "MacWhirter said firmly Theres no need for you to understand.",
    "He\ntook her hand and shook it heartily.",
    "Im very much obliged to you for\nyour cooperation.",
    "Whereupon he went straight out of the front door.",
    "Mary wondered if\nshe had been dreaming.",
    "Nevile and Thomas came in presently and the car arrived back shortly\nafterwards and Mary Aldin found herself envying Kay and Ted for\nbeing able to look quite cheerful.",
    "They were laughing and joking\ntogether.",
    "After all why not she thought.",
    "Camilla Tressilian had been\nnothing to Kay.",
    "All this tragic business was very hard on a bright\nyoung creature.",
    "They had just finished lunch when the police came.",
    "There was\nsomething\n\nscared\n\nin\n\nHurstalls\n\nvoice\n\nas\n\nhe\n\nannounced\n\nthat\n\nSuperintendent Battle and Inspector Leach were in the drawingroom.",
    "Superintendent Battles face was quite genial as he greeted them.",
    "Hope I havent disturbed you all he said apologetically.",
    "But there\nare one or two things Id like to know about.",
    "This glove for instance\nwho does it belong to\n\nHe held it out a small yellow chamois leather glove.",
    "He addressed Audrey.",
    "Is this yours Mrs.",
    "Strange\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "No  no it isnt mine.",
    "Miss Aldin\n\nI dont think so.",
    "I have none of that colour.",
    "May I see Kay held out her hand.",
    "No.",
    "Kay tried but the glove was too small.",
    "Miss Aldin\n\nMary tried in her turn.",
    "Its too small for you also said Battle.",
    "He turned back to Audrey.",
    "I\nthink youll find it fits you all right.",
    "Your hand is smaller than either of\nthe other ladies.",
    "Audrey took it from him and slipped it on over her right hand.",
    "Nevile Strange said sharply Shes already told you Battle that it isnt\nher glove.",
    "Ah well said Battle perhaps she made a mistake.",
    "Or forgot.",
    "Audrey said It may be mine  gloves are so alike arent they\n\nBattle said At any rate it was found outside your window Mrs.",
    "Strange pushed down into the ivy  with its fellow.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Audrey opened her mouth to speak then closed it\nup again.",
    "Her eyes fell before the Superintendents steady gaze.",
    "Nevile sprang forward.",
    "Look here.",
    "Superintendent \n\nPerhaps we might have a word with you Mr.",
    "Strange privately\nBattle said gravely.",
    "Certainly Superintendent.",
    "Come into the library.",
    "He led the way and the two police officers followed him.",
    "As soon as the door had closed Nevile said sharply Whats this\nridiculous story about gloves outside my wifes window\n\nBattle said quietly Mr.",
    "Strange weve found some very curious things\nin this house.",
    "Nevile frowned.",
    "Curious What do you mean by curious\n\nIll show you.",
    "In obedience to a nod.",
    "Leach left the room and came back holding a\nvery strange implement.",
    "Battle said This consists as you see sir of a steel ball taken from a\nVictorian fender  a heavy steel ball.",
    "Then the head has been sawn off\na tennis racquet and the ball has been screwed into the handle of the\nracquet.",
    "He paused.",
    "I think there can be no doubt that this is what was used to\nkill Lady Tressilian.",
    "Horrible said Nevile with a shudder.",
    "But where did you find this this nightmare\n\nThe ball had been cleaned and put back on the fender.",
    "The murderer\nhad however neglected to clean the screw.",
    "We found a trace of blood\non that.",
    "In the same way the handle and the head of the racquet were\njoined together again by means of adhesive surgical plaster.",
    "It was\nthen thrown carelessly back into the cupboard under the stairs where\nit would probably have remained quite unnoticed amongst so many\nothers if we hadnt happened to be looking for something of that kind.",
    "Smart of you Superintendent.",
    "Just a matter of routine.",
    "No fingerprints I suppose\n\nThat racquet which belongs by its weight I should say to Mrs. Kay\nStrange has been handled by her and also by you and both your\nprints are on it.",
    "But it also shows unmistakable signs that someone\nwearing gloves handled it after you did.",
    "There was just one other\n\n\ffingerprint  left this time in inadvertence I think.",
    "That was on the\nsurgical strapping that had been applied to bind the racquet together\nagain.",
    "Im not going for the moment to say whose print that was.",
    "Ive\ngot some other points to mention first.",
    "Battle paused then he said I want you to prepare yourself for a\nshock Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "And first I want to ask you something.",
    "Are you\nquite sure that it was your own idea to have this meeting here and that\nit was not actually suggested to you by Mrs. Audrey Strange\n\nAudrey did nothing of the sort.",
    "Audrey \n\nThe door opened and Thomas Royde came in.",
    "Sorry to butt in he said but I thought Id like to be in on this.",
    "Nevile turned a harassed face towards him.",
    "Do you mind old fellow This is all rather private.",
    "Im afraid I dont care about that.",
    "You see I heard a name outside.",
    "He\npaused.",
    "Audreys name.",
    "And what the hell has Audreys name got to do with you demanded\nNevile his temper rising.",
    "Well what has it to do with you if it comes to that I havent said\nanything definite to Audrey but I came here meaning to ask her to\nmarry me and I think she knows it.",
    "Whats more I mean to marry her.",
    "Superintendent Battle coughed.",
    "Nevile turned to him with a start.",
    "Sorry Superintendent.",
    "This interruption \n\nBattle said It doesnt matter to me Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Ive got one more\nquestion to ask you.",
    "That dark blue coat you wore at dinner the night\nof the murder its got fair hairs inside the collar and on the shoulders.",
    "Do you know how they got there\n\nI suppose theyre my hairs.",
    "Oh no theyre not yours sir.",
    "Theyre a ladys hairs and theres a red\nhair on the sleeve.",
    "I suppose thats my wifes  Kays.",
    "The others you are suggesting are\nAudreys Very likely they are.",
    "I caught my cuff button in her hair one\nnight outside on the terrace.",
    "I remember.",
    "In that case murmured Leach the fair hair would be on the cuff.",
    "What the devil are you suggesting cried Nevile.",
    "Theres a trace of powder too inside the coat collar said Battle.",
    "Primavera Naturelle No.",
    "1  a very pleasantscented powder and\nexpensive  but its no good telling me that you use it Mr.",
    "Strange\nbecause I shant believe you.",
    "And Mrs. Kay Strange uses Orchid Sun\nKiss.",
    "Mrs. Audrey Strange does use Primavera Naturelle No.",
    "1.",
    "What are you suggesting repeated Nevile.",
    "Battle leaned forward.",
    "Im suggesting that  on some occasion Mrs. Audrey Strange wore\nthat coat.",
    "Its the only reasonable way the hair and the powder could\n\n\fget where it did.",
    "Then youve seen that glove I produced just now Its\nher glove all right.",
    "That was the right hand heres the left.",
    "He drew it\nout of his pocket and put it down on the table.",
    "It was crumpled and\nstained with rusty brown patches.",
    "Nevile said with a note of fear in his voice Whats that on it\n\nBlood Mr.",
    "Strange said Battle firmly.",
    "And youll note this its the\nleft hand.",
    "Now Mrs. Audrey Strange is lefthanded.",
    "I noted that first\nthing when I saw her sitting with her coffee cup in her right hand and\nher cigarette in her left at the breakfast table.",
    "And the pen tray on her\nwritingtable had been shifted to the lefthand side.",
    "It all fits in.",
    "The\nknob from her grate the gloves outside her window the hair and\npowder on the coat.",
    "Lady Tressilian was struck on the right temple but the position of the bed made it impossible for anyone to have stood\non the other side of it.",
    "It follows that to strike Lady Tressilian a blow\nwith the right hand would be a very awkward thing to do  but its the\nnatural way to strike for a lefthanded person ...\n\nAre you suggesting that Audrey  Audrey would make all these\nelaborate preparations and strike down an old lady whom she had\nknown for years in order to get her hands on that old ladys money\n\nBattle shook his head.",
    "Im suggesting nothing of the sort.",
    "Im sorry Mr.",
    "Strange youve got\nto understand just how things are.",
    "This crime first last and all the\ntime was directed against you.",
    "Ever since you left her Audrey\nStrange has been brooding over the possibilities of revenge.",
    "In the end\nshe has become mentally unbalanced.",
    "Perhaps she was never\n\n\fmentally very strong.",
    "She thought perhaps of killing you but that\nwasnt enough.",
    "She thought at last of getting you hanged for murder.",
    "She chose an evening when she knew you had quarrelled with Lady\nTressilian.",
    "She took the coat from your bedroom and wore it when she\nstruck the old lady down so that it should be bloodstained.",
    "She put\nyour niblick on the floor knowing we would find your fingerprints on it\nand smeared blood and hair on the head of the club.",
    "It was she who\ninstilled into your mind the idea of coming here when she was here.",
    "And the thing that saved you was the one thing she couldnt count on the fact that Lady Tressilian rang her bell for Barrett and that Barrett\nsaw you leave the house.",
    "Nevile had buried his face in his hands.",
    "He said now Its not true.",
    "Its\nnot true Audreys never borne a grudge against me.",
    "Youve got the\nwhole thing wrong.",
    "Shes the straightest truest creature  without one\nthought of evil in her heart.",
    "Its not my business to argue with you Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "I only wanted to\nprepare you.",
    "I shall caution Mrs.",
    "Strange and ask her to accompany\nme.",
    "Ive got the warrant.",
    "Youd better see about getting a solicitor for\nher.",
    "Its preposterous.",
    "Absolutely preposterous.",
    "Love turns to hate more easily than you think Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "I tell you its all wrong  preposterous.",
    "Thomas Royde broke in.",
    "His voice was quiet and pleasant.",
    "Do stop repeating that its preposterous Nevile.",
    "Pull yourself\ntogether.",
    "Dont you see that the only thing that can help Audrey now is\nfor you to give up all your ideas of chivalry and come out with the\ntruth\n\nThe truth You mean \n\nI mean the truth about Audrey and Adrian.",
    "Royde turned to the\npolice officers.",
    "You see Superintendent youve got the facts wrong.",
    "Nevile didnt leave Audrey.",
    "She left him.",
    "She ran away with my brother\nAdrian.",
    "Then Adrian was killed in a car accident.",
    "Nevile behaved with\nthe utmost chivalry to Audrey.",
    "He arranged that she should divorce\nhim and that he would take the blame.",
    "Didnt want her name dragged through the mud muttered Nevile\nsulkily.",
    "Didnt know anyone knew.",
    "Adrian wrote out to me just before explained Thomas briefly.",
    "He\nwent on Dont you see Superintendent that knocks your motive out\nAudrey has no cause to hate Nevile.",
    "On the contrary she has every\nreason to be grateful to him.",
    "Hes tried to get her to accept an\nallowance which she wouldnt do.",
    "Naturally when he wanted her to\ncome and meet Kay she didnt feel she could refuse.",
    "You see Nevile put in eagerly  that cuts out her motive.",
    "Thomas is\nright.",
    "Battles wooden face was immovable.",
    "Motives only one thing he said.",
    "I may have been wrong about that.",
    "But facts are another.",
    "All the facts show that shes guilty.",
    "Nevile said meaningly All the facts showed that I was guilty two days\nago Battle seemed a little taken aback.",
    "Thats true enough.",
    "But look here Mr.",
    "Strange at what youre asking\nme to believe.",
    "Youre asking me to believe that theres someone who\nhates both of you  someone who if the plot against you failed had laid\na second trail to lead to Audrey Strange.",
    "Now can you think of anyone\nMr.",
    "Strange who hates both you and your former wife\n\nNeviles head had dropped into his hands again.",
    "When you say it like that you make it all sound fantastic\n\nBecause it is fantastic.",
    "Ive got to go by the facts.",
    "If Mrs.",
    "Strange has\nany explanation to offer \n\nDid I have any explanation asked Nevile.",
    "Its no good Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Ive got to do my duty.",
    "Battle got up abruptly.",
    "He and Leach left the room first.",
    "Nevile and\nRoyde came close behind them.",
    "They went on across the hall into the drawingroom.",
    "There they\nstopped.",
    "Audrey Strange got up.",
    "She walked forward to meet them.",
    "She looked\nstraight at Battle her lips parted in what was very nearly a smile.",
    "She said very softly You want me dont you Battle became very\nofficial.",
    "Mrs.",
    "Strange I have a warrant here for your arrest on the charge of\nmurdering Camilla Tressilian on Monday last September 12th.",
    "I must\ncaution you that anything you say will be written down and may be\nused in evidence at your trial.",
    "Audrey gave a sigh.",
    "Her small clearcut face was peaceful and pure as\na cameo.",
    "Its almost a relief.",
    "Im glad its  over\n\nNevile sprang forward.",
    "Audrey  dont say anything  dont speak at all.",
    "She smiled at him.",
    "But why not Nevile Its all true  and Im so tired.",
    "Leach drew a deep breath.",
    "Well that was that.",
    "Mad as a hatter of\ncourse but it would save a lot of worry He wondered what had\nhappened to his uncle.",
    "The old boy was looking as though he had seen\na ghost.",
    "Staring at the poor demented creature as though he couldnt\nbelieve his eyes.",
    "Oh well it had been an interesting case.",
    "Leach\nthought comfortably.",
    "And then an almost grotesque anticlimax Hurstall opened the\ndrawingroom door and announced Mr. MacWhirter.",
    "MacWhirter strode in purposefully.",
    "He went straight up to Battle.",
    "Are\nyou the police officer in charge of the Tressilian case he asked.",
    "I am.",
    "Then I have an important statement to make.",
    "I am sorry not to have\ncome forward before but the importance of something I happened to\nsee on the night of Monday last has only just dawned on me.",
    "He gave a quick glance round the room.",
    "If I can speak to you\nsomewhere\n\nBattle turned to Leach.",
    "Will you stay here with Mrs.",
    "Strange\n\nLeach said officially Yes sir.",
    "Then he leant forward and whispered something into the others ear.",
    "Battle turned to MacWhirter.",
    "Come this way.",
    "He led the way into the library.",
    "Now then whats all this My colleague tells me that hes seen you\nbefore  last winter\n\nQuite right said MacWhirter.",
    "Attempted suicide.",
    "Thats part of my\nstory.",
    "Go on Mr. MacWhirter.",
    "Last January I attempted to kill myself by throwing myself off Stark\nHead.",
    "This year the fancy took me to revisit the spot.",
    "I walked up there\non Monday night.",
    "I stood there for some time.",
    "I looked down at the sea\nand across to Easterhead Bay and I then looked to my left.",
    "That is to\nsay I looked across towards this house.",
    "I could see it quite plainly in\nthe moonlight.",
    "Yes.",
    "Until today I had not realised that that was the night when a murder\nwas committed.",
    "He leant forward.",
    "Ill tell you what I saw.",
    "XVI\n\nIt was really only about five minutes before Battle returned to the\ndrawingroom but to those there it seemed much longer.",
    "Kay had suddenly lost control of herself.",
    "She had cried out to Audrey\nI knew it was you.",
    "I always knew it was you.",
    "I knew you were up to\nsomething \n\nMary Aldin said quickly Please Kay.",
    "Nevile said sharply Shut up\nKay for Gods sake.",
    "Ted Latimer came over to Kay who had begun to\ncry.",
    "Get a grip on yourself he said kindly.",
    "He said to Nevile angrily You dont seem to realise that Kay has been\nunder a lot of strain Why dont you look after her a bit.",
    "Strange\n\nIm all right said Kay.",
    "For two pins said Ted Id take you away from the lot of them\n\nInspector Leach cleared his throat.",
    "A lot of injudicious things were\nsaid at times like these as he well knew.",
    "The unfortunate part was that\nthey were usually remembered most inconveniently afterwards.",
    "Battle came back into the room.",
    "His face was expressionless.",
    "He said Will you put one or two things together Mrs.",
    "Strange Im\nafraid Inspector Leach must come upstairs with you.",
    "Mary Aldin said Ill come too.",
    "When the two women had left the room with the Inspector Nevile said\nanxiously Well what did that chap want\n\nBattle said slowly Mr. MacWhirter tells a very odd story.",
    "Does it\nhelp Audrey Are you still determined to arrest her Ive told you Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Ive got to do my duty.",
    "Nevile turned away the eagerness\ndying out of his face.",
    "He said Id better telephone Trelawny I\nsuppose.",
    "Theres no immediate hurry for that Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "Theres a certain\nexperiment I want to make first as a result of Mr. MacWhirters\nstatement.",
    "Ill just see that Mrs.",
    "Strange gets off first.",
    "Audrey was coming down the stairs Inspector Leach beside her.",
    "Her\nface still had that remote detached composure.",
    "Nevile came towards her his hands outstretched.",
    "Audrey \n\n\fHer colourless glance swept over him.",
    "She said Its all right Nevile.",
    "I\ndont mind.",
    "I dont mind anything.",
    "Thomas Royde stood by the front door almost as though he would bar\nthe way out.",
    "A very faint smile came to her lips.",
    "\u2018True Thomas she murmured.",
    "He\nmumbled If theres anything I can do  No one can do anything\nsaid Audrey.",
    "She went out with her head high.",
    "A police car was waiting outside with\nSergeant Jones in it.",
    "Audrey and Leach got in.",
    "Ted Latimer murmured appreciatively Lovely exit\n\nNevile turned on him furiously.",
    "Superintendent Battle dexterously\ninterposed his bulk and raised a soothing voice As I said Ive got an\nexperiment to make.",
    "Mr. MacWhirter is waiting down at the ferry.",
    "Were to join him there in ten minutes time.",
    "We shall be going out in a\nmotorlaunch so the ladies had better wrap up warmly.",
    "In ten minutes\nplease.",
    "He might have been a stage manager ordering a company on to the\nstage.",
    "He took no notice at all of their puzzled faces.",
    "Zero Hour\n\nI\n\n\fIt was chilly on the water and Kay hugged the little fur jacket she was\nwearing closer round her.",
    "The launch chugged down the river below Gulls Point and then swung\nround into the little bay that divided Gulls Point from the frowning\nmass of Stark Head.",
    "Once or twice a question began to be asked but each time\nSuperintendent Battle held up a large hand rather like a cardboard\nham intimating that the time had not come yet.",
    "So the silence was\nunbroken save for the rushing of the water past them.",
    "Kay and Ted\nstood together looking down into the water.",
    "Nevile was slumped down\nhis legs stuck out.",
    "Mary Aldin and Thomas Royde sat up in the bows.",
    "And one and all glanced from time to time curiously at the tall aloof\nfigure of MacWhirter by the stern.",
    "He looked at none of them but stood\nwith his back turned and his shoulders hunched up.",
    "Not until they were under the frowning shadow of Stark Head did\nBattle throttle down the engine and begin to speak his piece.",
    "He spoke\nwithout selfconsciousness and in a tone that was more reflective than\nanything else.",
    "This has been a very odd case  one of the oddest Ive ever known\nand Id like to say something on the subject of murder generally.",
    "What\nIm going to say is not original  actually I overheard young Mr. Daniels\nthe K.C.",
    "say something of the kind and I wouldnt be surprised if hed\ngot it from someone else  hed a trick of doing that\n\nIts this When you read the account of a murder  or say a fiction\nstory based on murder  you usually begin with the murder itself.",
    "Thats all wrong.",
    "The murder begins a long time beforehand.",
    "A murder\nis the culmination of a lot of different circumstances all converging at\na given moment at a given point.",
    "People are brought into it from\ndifferent parts of the globe and for unforeseen reasons.",
    "Mr. Royde is\nhere from Malaya.",
    "Mr. MacWhirter is here because he wanted to revisit\na spot where he once tried to commit suicide.",
    "The murder itself is the\nend of the story.",
    "Its Zero Hour\n\nHe paused.",
    "Its Zero Hour now.",
    "Five faces were turned to him  only five for MacWhirter did not turn\nhis head.",
    "Five puzzled faces.",
    "Mary Aldin said You mean that Lady Tressilians death was the\nculmination of a long train of circumstances\n\nNo Miss Aldin not Lady Tressilians death.",
    "Lady Tressilians death\nwas only incidental to the main object of the murderer.",
    "The murder I\nam talking of is the murder of Audrey Strange.",
    "He listened to the sharp indrawing of breath.",
    "He wondered if\nsuddenly someone was afraid ...",
    "This crime was planned quite a long time ago  probably as early as\nlast winter.",
    "It was planned down to the smallest detail.",
    "It had one\nobject and one object only that Audrey Strange should be hanged by\nthe neck till she was dead ...",
    "It was very cunningly planned by someone who thought themselves\nvery clever.",
    "Murderers are usually vain.",
    "There was first the superficial\n\n\funsatisfactory evidence against Nevile Strange which we were meant\nto see through.",
    "But having been presented with one lot of faked\nevidence it was not considered likely that we should consider a\nsecond edition of the same thing.",
    "And yet if you come to look at it all\nthe evidence against Audrey Strange could be faked.",
    "The weapon\ntaken from her fireplace her gloves  the lefthand glove dipped in\nblood  hidden in the ivy outside her window.",
    "The powder she uses\ndusted on the inside of a coat collar and a few hairs placed there too.",
    "Her own fingerprint occurring quite naturally on a roll of adhesive\nplaster taken from her room.",
    "Even the lefthanded nature of the blow.",
    "And there was the final damning evidence of Mrs.",
    "Strange herself I\ndont believe theres one of you except the one who knows who can\ncredit her innocence after the way she behaved when we took her into\ncustody.",
    "Practically admitted her guilt didnt she I mightnt have\nbelieved in her being innocent myself if it hadnt been for a private\nexperience of my own ...",
    "Struck me right between the eyes it did\nwhen I saw and heard her  because you see Id known another girl\nwho did that very same thing who admitted guilt when she wasnt\nguilty  and Audrey Strange was looking at me with that other girls\neyes ...\n\nId got to do my duty.",
    "I knew that.",
    "We police officers have to act on\nevidence not on what we feel and think.",
    "But I can tell you that at that\nminute I prayed for a miracle  because I didnt see that anything but a\nmiracle was going to help that poor lady.",
    "Well I got my miracle.",
    "Got it right away\n\nMr. MacWhirter here turned up with his story.",
    "He paused.",
    "Mr. MacWhirter will you repeat what you told me up at the house\n\nMacWhirter turned.",
    "He spoke in short sharp sentences that carried\nconviction just because of their conciseness.",
    "He told of his rescue from the cliff the preceding January and of his\nwish to revisit the scene.",
    "He went on I went up there on Monday\nnight.",
    "I stood there lost in my own thoughts.",
    "It must have been I\nsuppose in the neighbourhood of eleven oclock.",
    "I looked across at\nthat house on the point  Gulls Point as I know it now to be.",
    "He paused and then went on There was a rope hanging from a\nwindow of that house into the sea.",
    "I saw a man climbing up that rope\n...\n\nJust a moment elapsed before they took it in.",
    "Mary Aldin cried out\nThen it was an outsider after all It was nothing to do with any of us.",
    "It\nwas an ordinary burglar\n\nNot quite so fast said Battle.",
    "It was someone who came from the\nother side of the river yes since he swam across.",
    "But someone in the\nhouse had to have the rope ready for him therefore someone inside\nmust have been concerned.",
    "He went on slowly And we know of someone who was on the other\nside of the river that night  someone who wasnt seen between tenthirty and a quarterpast eleven and who might have been swimming\n\n\fover and back.",
    "Someone who might have had a friend on this side of\nthe water.",
    "He added Eh Mr. Latimer\n\nTed took a step backward.",
    "He cried out shrilly But I cant swim\nEverybody knows I cant swim.",
    "Kay tell them I cant swim.",
    "Of course Ted cant swim Kay cried.",
    "Is that so asked Battle\npleasantly.",
    "He moved along the boat as Ted moved in the other direction.",
    "There\nwas some clumsy movement and a splash.",
    "Dear me said Superintendent Battle in deep concern.",
    "Mr. Latimers\ngone overboard.",
    "His hand closed like a vice on Neviles arm as the latter was preparing\nto jump in after him.",
    "No no Mr.",
    "Strange.",
    "No need for you to get yourself wet.",
    "There are\ntwo of my men handy  fishing in the dinghy there.",
    "He peered over the\nside of the boat.",
    "Its quite true he said with interest.",
    "He cant swim.",
    "Its all right.",
    "Theyve got him.",
    "Ill apologise presently but really\ntheres only one way to make quite sure that a person cant swim and\nthats to throw them in and watch.",
    "You see Mr.",
    "Strange I like to be\nthorough.",
    "I had to eliminate Mr. Latimer first.",
    "Mr. Royde here has got\na groggy arm he couldnt do any ropeclimbing.",
    "Battles voice took on a purring quality.",
    "So that brings us to you doesnt it Mr.",
    "Strange A good athlete a\nmountain climber a swimmer and all that.",
    "You went over on the 10.30\nferry all right but no one can swear to seeing you at the Easterhead\nHotel until a quarterpast eleven in spite of your story of having been\nlooking for Mr. Latimer then.",
    "Nevile jerked his arm away.",
    "He threw back his head and laughed.",
    "You\nsuggest that I swam across the river and climbed op a rope  Which\nyou had left ready hanging from your window said Battle.",
    "Killed Lady Tressilian and swam back again Why should I do such a\nfantastic thing And who laid all those clues against me I suppose I\nlaid them against myself\n\nExactly said Battle.",
    "And not half a bad idea either.",
    "And why\nshould I want to kill Camilla Tressilian\n\nYou didnt said Battle.",
    "But you did want to hang the woman who left\nyou for another man.",
    "Youre a bit unhinged mentally you know.",
    "Have\nbeen ever since you were a child  Ive looked up that old bow and\narrow case by the way.",
    "Anyone who does you an injury has to be\npunished  and death doesnt seem to you an excessive penalty for\nthem to pay.",
    "Death by itself wasnt enough for Audrey  your Audrey\nwhom you loved  oh yes you loved her all right before your love\nturned to hate.",
    "You had to think of some special kind of death some\nlongdrawnout specialised death.",
    "And when youd thought of it the\nfact that it entailed the killing of a woman who had been something like\na mother to you didnt worry you in the least ...\n\n\fNevile said and his voice was quite gentle All lies All lies And Im\nnot mad.",
    "Im not mad.",
    "Battle said contemptuously Flicked you on the raw didnt she when\nshe went off and left you for another man Hurt your vanity To think\nshe should walk out on you.",
    "You salved your pride by pretending to the\nworld at large that youd left her and you married another girl who was\nin love with you just to bolster up that belief.",
    "But underneath you\nplanned what youd do to Audrey.",
    "You couldnt think of anything worse\nthan this  to get her hanged.",
    "A fine idea  pity you hadnt the brains to\ncarry it out better\n\nNeviles\n\ntweedcoated\n\nshoulders\n\nmoved\n\na\n\nqueer\n\nwriggling\n\nmovement.",
    "Battle went on Childish  all that niblick stuff Those crude trails\npointing to you Audrey must have known what you were after She\nmust have laughed up her sleeve Thinking I didnt suspect you You\nmurderers are funny little fellows So puffed up.",
    "Always thinking youve\nbeen clever and resourceful and really being quite pitifully childish ...",
    "It was a strange queer scream that came from Nevile.",
    "It was a clever idea  it was.",
    "Youd never have guessed.",
    "Never Not if it\nhadnt been for this interfering jackanapes this pompous Scotch fool.",
    "Id thought out every detail  every detail I cant help what went wrong.",
    "How was I to know Royde knew the truth about Audrey and Adrian\nAudrey and Adrian ... Curse Audrey  she shall hang  youve got to\nhang her I want her to die afraid  to die  to die ...",
    "I hate her.",
    "I tell you I\nwant her to die ...",
    "The high whinnying voice died away.",
    "Nevile slumped down and began\nto cry quietly.",
    "Oh God said Mary Aldin.",
    "She was white to the lips.",
    "Battle said gently in a low voice Im sorry but I had to push him over\nthe edge ...",
    "There was precious little evidence you know.",
    "Nevile was still whimpering.",
    "His voice was like a childs.",
    "I want her to be hanged.",
    "I do want her to be hanged ...\n\nMary Aldin shuddered and turned to Thomas Royde.",
    "He took her hands in his.",
    "II\n\nI was always frightened said Audrey.",
    "They were sitting on the terrace.",
    "Audrey sat close to Superintendent\nBattle.",
    "Battle had resumed his holiday and was at Gulls Point as a\nfriend.",
    "Always frightened  all the time said Audrey.",
    "Battle said nodding his head I knew you were dead scared first\nmoment I saw you.",
    "And youd got that colourless reserved way people\n\n\fhave who are holding some very strong emotion in check.",
    "It might\nhave been love or hate but actually it was fear wasnt it\n\nShe nodded.",
    "I began to be afraid of Nevile soon after we were married.",
    "But the\nawful thing is you see that I didnt know why.",
    "I began to think that I\nwas mad.",
    "It wasnt you said Battle.",
    "Nevile seemed to me when I married him so particularly sane and\nnormal always delightfully goodtempered and pleasant.",
    "Interesting said Battle.",
    "He played the part of the good sportsman\nyou know.",
    "Thats why he could keep his temper so well at tennis.",
    "His\nrole as a good sportsman was more important to him than winning\nmatches.",
    "But it put a strain upon him of course playing a part always\ndoes.",
    "He got worse underneath.",
    "Underneath whispered Audrey with a shudder.",
    "Always underneath.",
    "Nothing you could get hold of.",
    "Just sometimes a word or a look and\nthen Id fancy Id imagined it ... Something queer.",
    "And then as I say I\nthought I must be queer.",
    "And I went on getting more and more afraid the kind of unreasoning fear you know that makes you sick\n\nI told myself I was going mad.",
    "That I couldnt help it I felt Id do\nanything in the world to get away And then Adrian came and told me\nhe loved me and I thought it would be wonderful to go away with him\nand he said ...\n\n\fShe stopped.",
    "You know what happened I went off to meet Adrian  he never came\n... he was killed ...",
    "I felt as though Nevile had managed it somehow.",
    "Perhaps he did said Battle.",
    "Audrey turned a startled face to him.",
    "Oh do you think so\n\nWell never know now.",
    "Motor accidents can be arranged.",
    "Dont brood\non it though Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "As likely as not it just happened naturally.",
    "I I was all broken up.",
    "I went back to the Rectory  Adrians home.",
    "We\nwere to have written to his mother but as she didnt know about us I\nthought I wouldnt tell her and give her pain.",
    "And Nevile came almost\nat once.",
    "He was very nice and kind  and all the time I talked to him I\nwas quite sick with fear He said no one need know about Adrian that I\ncould divorce him on evidence he would send me and that he was\ngoing to remarry afterwards.",
    "I felt so thankful.",
    "I knew he had thought\nKay attractive and I hoped that everything would turn out right and\nthat I should get over this queer obsession of mine.",
    "I still thought it\nmust be me.",
    "But I couldnt get rid of it  quite.",
    "I never felt Id really escaped.",
    "And\nthen I met Nevile in the Park one day and he explained that he did so\nwant me and Kay to be friends and suggested that we should all come\nhere in September.",
    "I couldnt refuse  how could I After all the kind\nthings hed done.",
    "Will you walk into my parlour Said the spider to the fly remarked\nSuperintendent Battle.",
    "Audrey shivered.",
    "Yes just that ...",
    "Very clever he was about that said Battle.",
    "Protested so loudly to\neveryone that it was his idea that everyone at once got the impression\nthat it wasnt.",
    "Audrey said And then I got here  and it was like a kind of nightmare.",
    "I\nknew something awful was going to happen I knew Nevile meant it to\nhappen  and that it was to happen to me.",
    "But I didnt know what it was.",
    "I think you know that I nearly did go off my head I was just paralysed\nwith fright  like you are in a dream when somethings going to happen\nand you cant move ...\n\nIve always thought said Superintendent Battle that Id like to have\nseen a snake fascinate a bird so that it cant fly away  but now Im not\nso sure.",
    "Audrey went on.",
    "Even when Lady Tressilian was killed I didnt realise what it meant.",
    "I\nwas puzzled.",
    "I didnt even suspect Nevile.",
    "I knew he didnt care about\nmoney  it was absurd to think hed kill her in order to inherit fifty\nthousand pounds.",
    "I thought over and over again about Mr. Treves and the story he had\ntold that evening.",
    "Even then I didnt connect it with Nevile.",
    "Treves had\nmentioned some physical peculiarity by which he could recognise the\n\n\fchild of long ago.",
    "Ive got a scar on my ear but I dont think anyone\nelse has any sign that youd notice.",
    "Battle said Miss Aldin has a lock of white hair.",
    "Thomas Royde has a\nstiff right arm which might not have been only the result of an\nearthquake.",
    "Mr. Ted Latimer has rather an oddshaped skull.",
    "And\nNevile Strange \n\nHe paused.",
    "Surely there was no physical peculiarity about Nevile\n\nOh yes there was.",
    "His lefthand little finger is shorter than his right.",
    "Thats very unusual Mrs.",
    "Strange  very unusual indeed.",
    "So that was it\n\nThat was it.",
    "And Nevile hung that sign on the lift\n\nYes.",
    "Nipped down there and back whilst Royde and Latimer were\ngiving the old boy drinks.",
    "Clever and simple  doubt if we could ever\nprove that was murder.",
    "Audrey shivered again.",
    "Now now said Battle.",
    "Its all over now my dear.",
    "Go on talking.",
    "Youre very clever ...",
    "I havent talked so much for years\n\n\fNo thats whats been wrong.",
    "When did it first dawn on you what\nMaster Neviles game was\n\nI dont know exactly.",
    "It came to me all at once.",
    "He himself had been\ncleared and that left all of us.",
    "And then suddenly I saw him looking at\nme  a sort of gloating look.",
    "And I knew That was when  She stopped\nabruptly.",
    "That was when what  \n\nAudrey said slowly When I thought a quick way out would be  best.",
    "Superintendent Battle shook his head.",
    "Never give in.",
    "Thats my motto.",
    "Oh youre quite right.",
    "But you dont know what it does to you being so\nafraid for so long.",
    "It paralyses you  you cant think  you cant plan you just wait for something awful to happen.",
    "And then when it does\nhappen  she gave a sudden quick smile  youd be surprised at the\nrelief No more waiting and fearing  its come.",
    "Youll think Im quite\ndemented I suppose if I tell you that when you came to arrest me for\nmurder I didnt mind at all.",
    "Nevile had done his worst and it was over.",
    "I\nfelt so safe going off with Inspector Leach.",
    "Thats partly why we did it said Battle.",
    "I wanted you out of that\nmadmans reach.",
    "And besides if I wanted to break him down I wanted\nto be able to count on the shock of the reaction.",
    "Hed seen his plan\ncome off as he thought  so the jolt would be all the greater.",
    "If he hadnt broken down would there have been any evidence\n\nNot too much.",
    "There was MacWhirters story of seeing a man climb up\na rope in the moonlight.",
    "And there was the rope itself confirming his\nstory coiled up in the attic and still faintly damp.",
    "It was raining that\nnight you know.",
    "He paused and stared hard at Audrey as though he were expecting her\nto say something.",
    "As she merely looked interested he went on And there was the\npinstripe suit.",
    "He stripped of course in the dark on that rocky point on\nthe Easterhead Bay side and thrust his suit into a niche in the rock.",
    "As\nit happened he put it down on a decayed bit of fish washed up by the\nflood tide.",
    "It made a stained patch on the shoulder  and it smelt.",
    "There\nwas some talk I found out about the drains being wrong in the hotel.",
    "Nevile himself put that story about.",
    "Hed got his raincoat on over his\nsuit but the smell was a pervasive one.",
    "Then he got the wind up about\nthat suit afterwards and at the first opportunity he took it off to the\ncleaners and like a fool didnt give his own name.",
    "Took a name at\nrandom actually one hed seen in the hotel register.",
    "Thats how your\nfriend got hold of it and having a good head on him he linked it up with\nthe man climbing up the rope.",
    "You step on decayed fish but you dont\nput your shoulder down on it unless you have taken your clothes off to\nbathe at night and no one would bathe for pleasure on a wet night in\nSeptember.",
    "He fitted the whole thing together.",
    "Very ingenious man\nMr. MacWhirter.",
    "More than ingenious said Audrey.",
    "Mm well perhaps.",
    "Like to know about him I can tell you something\nof his history.",
    "Audrey listened attentively.",
    "Battle found her a good listener.",
    "She said\nI owe a lot to him  and to you.",
    "Dont owe very much to me said Superintendent Battle.",
    "If I hadnt\nbeen a fool Id have seen the point of that bell.",
    "Bell What bell\n\nThe bell in Lady Tressilians room.",
    "Always did feel there was\nsomething wrong about that bell.",
    "I nearly got it too when I came down\nthe stairs from the top floor and saw one of those poles you open\nwindows with.",
    "That was the whole point of the bell see  to give Nevile Strange an\nalibi.",
    "Lady T. didnt remember what she had rung for  of course she\ndidnt because she hadnt rung at all Nevile rang the bell from outside\nin the passage with that long pole the wires ran along the ceiling.",
    "So\ndown comes Barrett and sees Mr. Nevile Strange go downstairs and\nout and she finds Lady Tressilian alive and well.",
    "The whole business of\nthe maid was fishy.",
    "Whats the good of doping her for a murder thats\ngoing to be committed before midnight Ten to one she wont have\ngone off properly by then.",
    "But it fixes the murder as an inside job and\nit allows a little time for Nevile to play his role of first suspect  then\nBarrett speaks and Nevile is so triumphantly cleared that no one is\ngoing to inquire very closely as to exactly what time he got to the hotel.",
    "We know he didnt cross back by ferry and no boats had been taken.",
    "There remained the possibility of swimming.",
    "He was a powerful\nswimmer but even then the time must have been short.",
    "Up the rope\nhes left hanging into his bedroom and a good deal of water on the\nfloor as we noticed but without seeing the point Im sorry to say.",
    "Then into his blue coat and trousers along to Lady Tressilians room we wont go into that wouldnt have taken more than a couple of\nminutes hed fixed up that steel ball beforehand  then back out of his\nclothes down the rope and back to Easterhead.",
    "Suppose Kay had come in\n\nShed been mildly doped Ill bet.",
    "She was yawning from dinner on so\nthey tell me.",
    "Besides hed taken care to have a quarrel with her so\nthat shed lock her door and keep out of his way.",
    "Im trying to think if I noticed the ball was gone from the fender.",
    "I dont\nthink I did.",
    "When did he put it back\n\nNext morning when all the hullabaloo arose.",
    "Once he got back in Ted\nLatimers car he had all night to clear up his traces and fix things\nmend the tennis racquet etc.",
    "By the way he hit the old lady\nbackhanded you know.",
    "Thats why the crime appeared to be lefthanded.",
    "Stranges backhand was always his strong point remember\n\nDont  dont  Audrey put up her hands.",
    "I cant bear any more.",
    "He\nsmiled at her.",
    "All the same its done you good to talk it all out.",
    "Mrs.",
    "Strange may I\nbe impertinent and give you some advice\n\n\fYes please.",
    "You lived for eight years with a criminal lunatic  thats enough to sap\nany womans nerves.",
    "But youve got to snap out of it now Mrs.",
    "Strange.",
    "You dont need to be afraid any more  and youve got to make\nyourself realise that.",
    "Audrey smiled at him.",
    "The frozen look had gone from her face it was a\nsweet rather timid but confiding face with the wideapart eyes full of\ngratitude.",
    "She said hesitating a little You told the others there was a girl  a girl\nwho acted as I did\n\nBattle slowly nodded his head.",
    "My own daughter he said.",
    "So you see my dear that miracle had to\nhappen.",
    "These things are sent to teach us\n\nIII\n\nAndrew MacWhirter was packing.",
    "He laid three shirts carefully in his suitcase and then that dark blue\nsuit which he had remembered to fetch from the cleaners.",
    "Two suits\nleft by two different MacWhirters had been too much for the girl in\ncharge.",
    "There was a tap on the door and he called Come in.",
    "Audrey Strange walked in.",
    "She said Ive come to thank you  are you\npacking\n\nYes.",
    "Im leaving here tonight.",
    "And sailing the day after tomorrow.",
    "For South America\n\nFor Chile.",
    "She said Ill pack for you.",
    "He protested but she overbore him.",
    "He watched her as worked deftly\nand methodically.",
    "There she said when she had finished.",
    "You did that well said\nMacWhirter.",
    "There was a silence.",
    "Then Audrey said You saved my life.",
    "If you\nhadnt happened to see what you did see \n\nShe broke off.",
    "Then she said Did you realise at once that night on the cliff when you\n you stopped me going over  when you said Go home Ill see that\nyoure not hanged  did you realise then that youd got some important\nevidence\n\nNot precisely said MacWhirter.",
    "I had to think it out.",
    "Then how\ncould you say  what you did say\n\n\fMacWhirter always felt annoyed when he had to explain the intense\nsimplicity of his thought processes.",
    "I meant just precisely that  that I intended to prevent you from being\nhanged.",
    "The colour came up in Audreys cheeks.",
    "Supposing I had done it\n\nThat would have made no difference.",
    "Did you think I had done it then\n\nI didnt speculate on the matter overmuch.",
    "I was inclined to believe\nyou were innocent but it would have made no difference to my course\nof action.",
    "And then you remembered the man on the rope\n\nMacWhirter was silent for a few moments.",
    "Then he cleared his throat.",
    "You may as well know I suppose I did not actually see a man\nclimbing up a rope  indeed I could not have done so for I was up on\nStark Head on Sunday night not on Monday.",
    "I deduced what must\nhave happened from the evidence of the suit and my suppositions\nwere confirmed by the finding of a wet rope in the attic.",
    "From red Audrey had gone white.",
    "She said incredulously Your story\nwas all a lie\n\n\fDeductions would not have carried weight with the police.",
    "I had to say\nI saw what happened.",
    "But  you might have had to swear to it at my trial.",
    "Yes.",
    "You would have done that\n\nI would.",
    "Audrey cried incredulously And you  you are the man who lost his\njob and came down to throwing himself off a cliff because he wouldnt\ntamper with the truth\n\nI have a great regard for the truth.",
    "But Ive discovered there are\nthings that matter more.",
    "Such as\n\nYou said MacWhirter.",
    "Audreys eyes dropped.",
    "MacWhirter cleared his throat in an\nembarrassed manner.",
    "Theres no need for you to feel under a great obligation or anything of\nthat kind.",
    "Youll never hear of me again after today.",
    "The police have\ngot Stranges confession and theyll not need my evidence.",
    "In any\ncase I hear hes so bad hell maybe not live to come to trial.",
    "Im glad of that said Audrey.",
    "You were fond of him once Of the\nman I thought he was.",
    "MacWhirter nodded.",
    "Weve all felt that way maybe.",
    "He went on\nEverythings turned out well.",
    "Superintendent Battle was able to act\nupon my story and break down the man \n\nAudrey interrupted.",
    "She said He worked upon your story yes.",
    "But I\ndont believe you fooled him.",
    "He deliberately shut his eyes.",
    "Why do you say that\n\nWhen he was talking to me he mentioned it was lucky you saw what\nyou did in the moonlight and then added something  a sentence or\ntwo later  about it being a rainy night.",
    "MacWhirter was taken aback.",
    "Thats true.",
    "On Monday night I doubt if\nId have seen anything at all.",
    "It doesnt matter said Audrey.",
    "He knew that what you pretended to have seen was what had really\nhappened.",
    "But it explains why he worked on Nevile to break him down.",
    "He suspected Nevile as soon as Thomas told him about me and Adrian.",
    "He knew then that if he was right about the kind of crime  he had fixed\non the wrong person  what he wanted was some kind of evidence to\nuse on Nevile.",
    "He wanted as he said a miracle  you were\nSuperintendent Battles prayer.",
    "Thats a curious thing for him to say said MacWhirter dryly.",
    "So you\nsee said Audrey you are a miracle.",
    "My special miracle.",
    "MacWhirter said earnestly Id not like you to feel youre under an\nobligation to me.",
    "Im going right out of your life \n\nMust you said Audrey.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "The colour came up flooding her ears and temples.",
    "She said Wont you take me with you\n\nYou dont know what youre saying\n\nYes I do.",
    "Im doing something very difficult  but that matters to me\nmore than life or death.",
    "I know the time is very short.",
    "By the way Im\nconventional I should like to be married before we go\n\nNaturally said MacWhirter deeply shocked.",
    "You dont imagine Id\nsuggest anything else\n\nIm sure you wouldnt said Audrey.",
    "MacWhirter said Im not your kind.",
    "I thought youd marry that quiet\nfellow whos cared for you so long.",
    "Thomas Dear true Thomas.",
    "Hes too true.",
    "Hes faithful to the image\nof a girl he loved years ago.",
    "But the person he really cares for is Mary\nAldin though he doesnt know it yet himself.",
    "MacWhirter took a step towards her.",
    "He spoke sternly.",
    "Do you mean\nwhat youre saying\n\nYes ...",
    "I want to be with you always never to leave you.",
    "If you go I\nshall never find anybody like you and I shall go lonely all my days.",
    "MacWhirter sighed.",
    "He took out his wallet and carefully examined its\ncontents.",
    "He murmured A special licence comes expensive.",
    "Ill need to go to\nthe bank first thing tomorrow.",
    "I could lend you some money murmured Audrey.",
    "Youll do nothing of the kind.",
    "If I marry a woman I pay for the licence.",
    "You understand\n\nYou neednt said Audrey softly look so stern.",
    "He said gently as he came towards her Last time I had my hands on\nyou you felt like a bird  struggling to escape.",
    "Youll never escape now\n...\n\nShe said I shall never want to escape."
