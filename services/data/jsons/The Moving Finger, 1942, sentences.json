    "THE MOVING FINGER\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nI have often recalled the morning when the first of the anonymous\nletters came.",
    "It arrived at breakfast and I turned it over in the idle way one does\nwhen time goes slowly and every event must be spun out to its full\nextent.",
    "It was I saw a local letter with a typewritten address.",
    "I\nopened it before the two with London postmarks since one of them\nwas clearly a bill and on the other I recognised the handwriting of\none of my more tiresome cousins.",
    "It seems odd now to remember that Joanna and I were more\namused by the letter than anything else.",
    "We hadnt then the\nfaintest inkling of what was to come  the trail of blood and violence\nand suspicion and fear.",
    "One simply didnt associate that sort of thing with Lymstock.",
    "I see that I have begun badly.",
    "I havent explained Lymstock.",
    "When I took a bad crash flying I was afraid for a long time in spite\nof soothing words from doctors and nurses that I was going to be\ncondemned to lie on my back all my life.",
    "Then at last they took me\n\n\fout of the plaster and I learned cautiously to use my limbs and\nfinally Marcus Kent my doctor clapped me on my back and told me\nthat everything was going to be all right but that Id got to go and\nlive in the country and lead the life of a vegetable for at least six\nmonths.",
    "Go to some part of the world where you havent any friends.",
    "Get\nright away from things.",
    "Take an interest in local politics get excited\nabout village gossip absorb all the local scandal.",
    "Small beer  thats\nthe prescription for you.",
    "Absolute rest and quiet.",
    "Rest and quiet It seems funny to think of that now.",
    "And so Lymstock  and Little Furze.",
    "Lymstock had been a place of importance at the time of the Norman\nConquest.",
    "In the twentieth century it was a place of no importance\nwhatsoever.",
    "It was three miles from a main road  a little provincial\nmarket town with a sweep of moorland rising above it.",
    "Little Furze\nwas situated on the road leading up to the moors.",
    "It was a prim\nlow white house with a sloping Victorian veranda painted a faded\ngreen.",
    "My sister Joanna as soon as she saw it decided that it was the\nideal spot for a convalescent.",
    "Its owner matched the house a\ncharming little old lady quite incredibly Victorian who explained to\nJoanna that she would never have dreamed of letting her house if\nthings had not been so different nowadays  this terrible taxation.",
    "So everything was settled and the agreement signed and in due\ncourse Joanna and I arrived and settled in while Miss Emily Barton\nwent into rooms in Lymstock kept by a former parlourmaid my\nfaithful Florence and we were looked after by Miss Bartons\npresent maid Partridge a grim but efficient personage who was\nassisted by a daily girl.",
    "As soon as we had been given a few days to settle down Lymstock\ncame solemnly to call.",
    "Everybody in Lymstock had a label  rather\nlike happy families as Joanna said.",
    "There was Mr. Symmington the lawyer thin and dry with his\nquerulous bridgeplaying wife.",
    "Dr. Griffith  the dark melancholy\ndoctor  and his sister who was big and hearty.",
    "The vicar a\nscholarly absentminded elderly man and his erratic eagerfaced\nwife.",
    "Rich dilettante Mr. Pye of Priors End and finally Miss Emily\nBarton herself the perfect spinster of village tradition.",
    "Joanna fingered the cards with something like awe.",
    "I didnt know she said in an awestruck voice that people really\ncalled with cards\n\nThat I told her is because you know nothing about the country.",
    "Joanna is very pretty and very gay and she likes dancing and\ncocktails and love affairs and rushing about in highpowered cars.",
    "She is definitely and entirely urban.",
    "At any rate said Joanna I look all right.",
    "I studied her critically and was not able to agree.",
    "Joanna was dressed by Mirotin for le sport.",
    "The effect was quite\ncharming but a bit startling for Lymstock.",
    "No I said.",
    "Youre all wrong.",
    "You ought to be wearing an old\nfaded tweed skirt with a nice cashmere jumper matching it and\nperhaps a rather baggy cardigan coat and youd wear a felt hat\nand thick stockings and old wellworn brogues.",
    "Your face is all\nwrong too I added.",
    "Whats wrong with that Ive got on my Country Tan MakeUp No.",
    "2.",
    "Exactly I said.",
    "If you lived here you would have just a little\npowder to take the shine off the nose and you would almost\ncertainly be wearing all your eyebrows instead of only a quarter of\nthem.",
    "Joanna laughed and said that coming to the country was a new\nexperience and she was going to enjoy it.",
    "Im afraid youll be terribly bored I said remorsefully.",
    "No I shant.",
    "I really was fed up with all my crowd and though you\nwont be sympathetic I really was very cut up about Paul.",
    "It will take\nme a long time to get over it.",
    "I was skeptical over this.",
    "Joannas love affairs always run the same\ncourse.",
    "She has a mad infatuation for some completely spineless\nyoung man who is a misunderstood genius.",
    "She listens to his\nendless complaints and works to get him recognition.",
    "Then when\nhe is ungrateful she is deeply wounded and says her heart is\nbroken  until the next gloomy young man comes along which is\nusually about three weeks later.",
    "I did not take Joannas broken heart very seriously but I did see\nthat living in the country was like a new game to my attractive\nsister.",
    "She entered with zest into the pastime of returning calls.",
    "We\nduly received invitations to tea and to bridge which we accepted\nand issued invitations in our turn.",
    "To us it was all novel and entertaining  a new game.",
    "And as I say when the anonymous letter came it struck me at\nfirst as amusing too.",
    "For a minute or two after opening the letter I stared at it\nuncomprehendingly.",
    "Printed words had been cut out and pasted on\na sheet of paper.",
    "The letter using terms of the coarsest character expressed the\nwriters opinion that Joanna and I were not brother and sister.",
    "Hullo said Joanna.",
    "What is it\n\nIts a particularly foul anonymous letter I said.",
    "I was still suffering from shock.",
    "Somehow one didnt expect that\nkind of thing in the placid backwater of Lymstock.",
    "Joanna at once displayed lively interest.",
    "No What does it say\n\nIn novels I have noticed anonymous letters of a foul and disgusting\ncharacter are never shown if possible to women.",
    "It is implied that\nwomen must at all cost be shielded from the shock it might give\ntheir delicate nervous systems.",
    "I am sorry to say it never occurred to me not to show the letter to\nJoanna.",
    "I handed it to her at once.",
    "She vindicated my belief in her toughness by displaying no emotion\nbut that of amusement.",
    "What an awful bit of dirt Ive always heard about anonymous\nletters but Ive never seen one before.",
    "Are they always like this\n\nI cant tell you I said.",
    "Its my first experience too.",
    "Joanna began to giggle.",
    "You must have been right about my makeup Jerry.",
    "I suppose they\nthink I just must be an abandoned female\n\n\fThat I said coupled with the fact that our father was a tall dark\nlanternjawed man and our mother a fairhaired blueeyed little\ncreature and that I take after him and you take after her.",
    "Joanna nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Yes were not a bit alike.",
    "Nobody\nwould take us for brother and sister.",
    "Somebody certainly hasnt I said with feeling.",
    "Joanna said she thought it was rightfully funny.",
    "She dangled the\nletter thoughtfully by one corner and asked what we were to do\nwith it.",
    "The correct procedure I believe I said is to drop it into the fire\nwith a sharp exclamation of disgust.",
    "I suited the action to the word and Joanna applauded.",
    "You did that beautifully she said.",
    "You ought to have been on the\nstage.",
    "Its lucky we still have fires isnt it\n\nThe wastepaper basket would have been much less dramatic I\nagreed.",
    "I could of course have set light to it with a match and\nslowly watched it burn  or watched it slowly burn.",
    "Things never burn when you want them to said Joanna.",
    "They go\nout.",
    "Youd probably have had to strike match after match.",
    "She got up and went toward the window.",
    "Then standing there she\nturned her head sharply.",
    "I wonder she said who wrote it\n\nWere never likely to know I said.",
    "No  I suppose not.",
    "She was silent a moment and then said I\ndont know when I come to think of it that it is so funny after all.",
    "You\nknow I thought they  they liked us down here.",
    "So they do I said.",
    "This is just some halfcrazy brain on the\nborderline.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "Ughnasty\n\nAs she went out into the sunshine I thought to myself as I smoked\nmy afterbreakfast cigarette that she was quite right.",
    "It was nasty.",
    "Someone resented our coming here  someone resented Joannas\nbright young sophisticated beauty  someone wanted to hurt.",
    "To\ntake it with a laugh was perhaps the best way  but deep down it\nwasnt funny.",
    "Dr. Griffith came that morning.",
    "I had fixed up for him to give me a\nweekly overhaul.",
    "I liked Owen Griffith.",
    "He was dark ungainly with\nawkward ways of moving and deft very gentle hands.",
    "He had a\njerky way of talking and was rather shy.",
    "He reported progress to be encouraging.",
    "Then he added\n\nYoure feeling all right arent you Is it my fancy or are you a bit\nunder the weather this morning\n\n\fNot really I said.",
    "A particularly scurrilous anonymous letter\narrived with the morning coffee and its left rather a nasty taste in\nthe mouth.",
    "He dropped his bag on the floor.",
    "His thin dark face was excited.",
    "Do\nyou mean to say that youve had one of them\n\nI was interested.",
    "Theyve been going about then\n\nYes.",
    "For some time.",
    "Oh I said.",
    "I see.",
    "I was under the impression that our presence as\nstrangers was resented here.",
    "No no its nothing to do with that.",
    "Its just  He paused and then\nasked What did it say At least  he turned suddenly red and\nembarrassed  perhaps I oughtnt to ask\n\nIll tell you with pleasure I said.",
    "It just said that the fancy tart Id\nbrought down with me wasnt my sister  not half And that I may\nsay is a shortened version.",
    "His dark face flushed angrily.",
    "How damnable Your sister didnt  shes not upset I hope\n\n\fJoanna I said looks a little like the angel off the top of the\nChristmas tree but shes eminently modern and quite tough.",
    "She\nfound it highly entertaining.",
    "Such things havent come her way\nbefore.",
    "I should hope not indeed said Griffith warmly.",
    "And anyway I said firmly thats the best way to take it I think.",
    "As something utterly ridiculous.",
    "Yes said Owen Griffith only \n\nHe stopped and I chimed in quickly.",
    "Quite so I said.",
    "Only is the word\n\nThe trouble is he said that this sort of thing once it starts\ngrows.",
    "So I should imagine.",
    "Its pathological of course.",
    "I nodded.",
    "Any idea whos behind it I asked.",
    "No I wish I had.",
    "You see the anonymous letter pest arises from\none of two causes.",
    "Either its particular  directed at one person or\nset of people that is to say its motivated its someone whos got a\ndefinite grudge or thinks he has and who chooses a particularly\nnasty and underhand way of working it off.",
    "Its mean and disgusting\n\n\fbut its not necessarily crazy and its usually fairly easy to trace the\nwriter  a discharged servant a jealous woman and so on.",
    "But if its\ngeneral and not particular then its more serious.",
    "The letters are sent indiscriminately and serve the purpose of\nworking off some frustration in the writers mind.",
    "As I say its\ndefinitely pathological.",
    "And the craze grows.",
    "In the end of course\nyou track down the person in question  its often someone\nextremely unlikely and thats that.",
    "There was a bad outburst of that\nkind over the other side of the county last year  turned out to be the\nhead of the millinery department in a big drapers establishment.",
    "Quiet refined woman  had been there for years.",
    "I remember something of the same kind in my last practice up\nnorth.",
    "But that turned out to be purely personal spite.",
    "Still as I say\nIve seen something of this kind of thing and quite frankly it\nfrightens me\n\nHas it been going on long I asked.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "Hard to say of course because people who get\nthese letters dont go round advertising the fact.",
    "They put them in\nthe fire.",
    "He paused.",
    "Ive had one myself.",
    "Symmington the solicitor hes had one.",
    "And\none or two of my poorer patients have told me about them.",
    "All much the same sort of thing\n\n\fOh yes.",
    "A definite harping on the sex theme.",
    "Thats always a\nfeature.",
    "He grinned.",
    "Symmington was accused of illicit relations\nwith his lady clerk  poor old Miss Ginch whos forty at least with\npincenez and teeth like a rabbit.",
    "Symmington took it straight to the\npolice.",
    "My letters accused me of violating professional decorum\nwith my lady patients stressing the details.",
    "Theyre all quite\nchildish and absurd but horribly venomous.",
    "His face changed\ngrew grave.",
    "But all the same Im afraid.",
    "These things can be\ndangerous you know.",
    "I suppose they can.",
    "You see he said crude childishspite though it is sooner or\nlater one of these letters will hit the mark.",
    "And then God knows\nwhat may happen Im afraid too of the effect upon the slow\nsuspicious uneducated mind.",
    "If they see a thing written they\nbelieve its true.",
    "All sorts of complications may arise.",
    "It was an illiterate sort of letter I said thoughtfully written by\nsomebody practically illiterate I should say.",
    "Was it said Owen and went away.",
    "Thinking it over afterward I found that Was it rather disturbing.",
    "I am not going to pretend that the arrival of our anonymous letter\ndid not leave a nasty taste in the mouth.",
    "It did.",
    "At the same time it\nsoon passed out of my mind.",
    "I did not you see at that point take it\nseriously.",
    "I think I remember saying to myself that these things\n\n\fprobably happen fairly often in outoftheway villages.",
    "Some\nhysterical woman with a taste for dramatising herself was probably\nat the bottom of it.",
    "Anyway if the letters were as childish and silly\nas the one we had got they couldnt do much harm.",
    "The next incident if I may put it so occurred about a week later\nwhen Partridge her lips set tightly together informed me that\nBeatrice the daily help would not be coming today.",
    "I gather sir said Partridge that the girl has been upset.",
    "I was not very sure what Partridge was implying but I diagnosed\nwrongly some stomach trouble to which Partridge was too\ndelicate to allude more directly.",
    "I said I was sorry and hoped she\nwould soon be better.",
    "The girl is perfectly well sir said Partridge.",
    "She is upset in her\nfeelings.",
    "Oh I said rather doubtfully.",
    "Owing went on Partridge to a letter she has received.",
    "Making I\nunderstand insinuations.",
    "The grimness of Partridges eye made me apprehensive that the\ninsinuations were concerned with me.",
    "Since I could hardly have\nrecognised Beatrice by sight if I had met her in the town so\nunaware of her had I been I felt a not unnatural annoyance.",
    "An\ninvalid hobbling about on two sticks is hardly cast for the role of\ndeceiver of village girls.",
    "I said irritably\n\nWhat nonsense\n\nMy very words sir to the girls mother said Partridge.",
    "Goingson in this house I said to her there never have been and never will\nbe while I am in charge.",
    "As to Beatrice I said girls are different\nnowadays and as to goingson elsewhere I can say nothing.",
    "But\nthe truth is sir that Beatrices friend from the garage as she walks\nout with got one of them nasty letters too and he isnt acting\nreasonable at all.",
    "I have never heard anything so preposterous in my life I said\nangrily.",
    "Its my opinion sir said Partridge that were well rid of the girl.",
    "What I say is she wouldnt take on so if there wasnt something she\ndidnt want found out.",
    "No smoke without fire thats what I say.",
    "I had no idea how horribly tired I was going to get of that particular\nphrase.",
    "That morning by way of adventure I was to walk down to the\nvillage.",
    "The sun was shining the air was cool and crisp with the\nsweetness of spring in it.",
    "I assembled my sticks and started off\nfirmly refusing to permit Joanna to accompany me.",
    "It was arranged that she should pick me up with the car and drive\nme back up the hill in time for lunch.",
    "That ought to give you time to pass the time of day with everyone\nin Lymstock.",
    "I have no doubt I said that I shall have seen anybody who is\nanybody by then.",
    "For morning in the High Street was a kind of rendezvous for\nshoppers when news was exchanged.",
    "I did not after all walk down to the town unaccompanied.",
    "I had\ngone about two hundred yards when I heard a bicycle bell behind\nme then a scrunching of brakes and then Megan Hunter more or\nless fell off her machine at my feet.",
    "Hullo she said breathlessly as she rose and dusted herself off.",
    "I rather liked Megan and always felt oddly sorry for her.",
    "She\n\nwas\n\nSymmington\n\nthe\n\nlawyers\n\nstepdaughter\n\nMrs.\n\nSymmingtons daughter by a first marriage.",
    "Nobody talked much\nabout Mr. or Captain Hunter and I gathered that he was\nconsidered best forgotten.",
    "He was reported to have treated Mrs.\nSymmington very badly.",
    "She had divorced him a year or two after\nthe marriage.",
    "She was a woman with means of her own and had\nsettled down with her little daughter in Lymstock to forget and\nhad eventually married the only eligible bachelor in the place\nRichard Symmington.",
    "There were two boys of the second marriage to whom their parents\nwere devoted and I fancied that Megan sometimes felt oddman in\nthe establishment.",
    "She certainly did not resemble her mother who\nwas a small anaemic woman fadedly pretty who talked in a thin\nmelancholy voice of servant difficulties and her health.",
    "Megan was a tall awkward girl and although she was actually\ntwenty she looked more like a schoolgirlish sixteen.",
    "She had a\nshock of untidy brown hair hazelgreen eyes a thin bony face and\nan unexpectedly charming onesided smile.",
    "Her clothes were drab\nand unattractive and she usually had on lislethread stockings with\nholes in them.",
    "She looked I decided this morning much more like a horse than a\nhuman being.",
    "In fact she would have been a very nice horse with a\nlittle grooming.",
    "She spoke as usual in a kind of breathless rush\n\nIve been up to the farm  you know Lashers  to see if theyd got\nany duck eggs.",
    "Theyve got an awfully nice lot of little pigs.",
    "Sweet\nDo you like pigs I do.",
    "I even like the smell.",
    "Wellkept pigs shouldnt smell I said.",
    "Shouldnt they They all do around here.",
    "Are you walking down to\nthe town I saw you were alone so I thought Id stop and walk with\nyou only I stopped rather suddenly.",
    "Youve torn your stocking I said.",
    "Megan looked rather ruefully at her right leg.",
    "So I have.",
    "But its got two holes already so it doesnt matter very\nmuch does it\n\nDont you ever mend your stockings Megan\n\nRather.",
    "When Mummie catches me.",
    "But she doesnt notice awfully\nwhat I do  so its lucky in a way isnt it\n\nYou dont seem to realize youre grown up I said.",
    "You mean I ought to be more like your sister All dolled up\n\nI rather resented this description of Joanna.",
    "She looks clean and tidy and pleasing to the eye I said.",
    "Shes awfully pretty said Megan.",
    "She isnt a bit like you is she\nWhy not\n\nBrothers and sisters arent always alike.",
    "No.",
    "Of course Im not very like Brian or Colin.",
    "And Brian and Colin\narent like each other.",
    "She paused and said Its very rum isnt\nit\n\nWhat is\n\n\fMegan replied briefly\n\nFamilies.",
    "I said thoughtfully\n\nI suppose they are.",
    "I wondered just what was passing in her mind.",
    "We walked on in\nsilence for a moment or two then Megan said in a rather shy voice\n\nYou fly dont you\n\nYes.",
    "Thats how you got hurt\n\nYes I crashed.",
    "Megan said Nobody down here flies.",
    "No I said I suppose not.",
    "Would you like to fly Megan\n\nMe Megan seemed surprised.",
    "Goodness no.",
    "I should be sick.",
    "Im sick in a train even.",
    "She paused and then asked with that directness which only a child\nusually displays\n\n\fWill you get all right and be able to fly again or will you always be\na bit of a crock\n\nMy doctor says I shall be quite all right.",
    "Yes but is he the kind of man who tells lies\n\nI dont think so I replied.",
    "In fact Im quite sure of it.",
    "I trust him.",
    "Thats all right then.",
    "But a lot of people do tell lies.",
    "I accepted this undeniable statement of fact in silence.",
    "Megan said in a detached judicial kind of way Im glad.",
    "I was\nafraid you looked badtempered because you were crocked up for\nlife  but if its just natural its different.",
    "Im not badtempered I said coldly.",
    "Well irritable then.",
    "Im irritable because Im in a hurry to get fit again  and these\nthings cant be hurried.",
    "Then why fuss\n\nI began to laugh.",
    "My dear girl arent you ever in a hurry for things to happen\n\n\fMegan considered the question.",
    "She said No.",
    "Why should I be\nTheres nothing to be in a hurry about.",
    "Nothing ever happens.",
    "I was struck by something forlorn in the words.",
    "I said gently\n\nWhat do you do with yourself down here\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.",
    "What is there to do\n\nHavent you any hobbies Dont you play games Havent you got\nfriends around about\n\nIm stupid at games.",
    "There arent many girls around here and the\nones there are I dont like.",
    "They think Im awful.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Why should they\n\nMegan shook her head.",
    "We were now entering the High Street.",
    "Megan said sharply\n\nHeres Miss Griffith coming.",
    "Hateful woman.",
    "Shes ways at me to\njoin her foul Guides.",
    "I hate Guides.",
    "Why dress up and go about in\nclumps and put badges on yourself for something you havent really\nlearned to do properly.",
    "I think its all rot.",
    "On the whole I rather agreed with Megan.",
    "But Miss Griffith had\ndescended upon us before I could voice my assent.",
    "The doctors sister who rejoiced in the singularly inappropriate\nname of Aim\u0439e had all the positive assurance her brother lacked\nShe was a handsome woman in a masculine weatherbeaten way\nwith a deep voice.",
    "Hullo you two she bayed at us.",
    "Gorgeous morning isnt it\nMegan youre just the person I want to see.",
    "I want some help.",
    "Addressing envelopes for the Conservative Association.",
    "Megan muttered something elusive propped up her bicycle against\nthe curb and dived in a purposeful way into the International\nStores.",
    "Extraordinary child said Miss Griffith looking after her.",
    "Bone lazy.",
    "Spends her time mooning about.",
    "Must be a great trial to\npoor Mrs. Symmington.",
    "I know her mothers tried more than once to\nget her to take up something  shorthandtyping you know or\ncookery or keeping Angora rabbits.",
    "She needs an interest in life.",
    "I thought that was probably true but felt that in Megans place I\nshould have withstood firmly any of Aim\u0439e Griffiths suggestions for\nthe simple reason that her aggressive personality would have put\nmy back up.",
    "I dont believe in idleness went on Miss Griffith.",
    "And certainly\nnot for young people.",
    "Its not as though Megan was pretty or\nattractive or anything like that.",
    "Sometimes I think the girls halfwitted.",
    "A great disappointment to her mother.",
    "The father you\n\n\fknow she lowered her voice slightly was definitely a wrong un.",
    "Afraid the child takes after him.",
    "Painful for her mother.",
    "Oh well it\ntakes all sorts to make a world thats what I say.",
    "Fortunately I responded.",
    "Aim\u0439e Griffith gave a jolly laugh.",
    "Yes it wouldnt do if we were all made to one pattern.",
    "But I dont\nlike to see anyone not getting all he can out of life.",
    "I enjoy life myself\nand I want everyone to enjoy it too.",
    "People say to me you must be\nbored to death living down there in the country all the year around.",
    "Not a bit of it I say.",
    "Im always busy always happy Theres always\nsomething going on in the country.",
    "My times taken up what with\nmy Guides and the Institute and various committees  to say\nnothing of looking after Owen.",
    "At this minute Miss Griffith saw an acquaintance on the other side\nof the street and uttering a bay of recognition she leaped across\nthe road leaving me free to pursue my course to the bank.",
    "I always found Miss Griffith rather overwhelming.",
    "My business at the bank transacted satisfactorily I went on to the\noffices of Messrs. Galbraith Galbraith and Symmington.",
    "I dont\nknow if there were any Galbraiths extant.",
    "I never saw any.",
    "I was\nshown into Richard Symmingtons inner office which had the\nagreeable mustiness of a longestablished legal firm.",
    "Vast numbers of deed boxes labeled Lady Hope Sir Everard Carr\nWilliam YatesbyHoares Esq.",
    "Deceased etc.",
    "gave the required\natmosphere of decorous county families and legitimate longestablished business.",
    "Studying Mr. Symmington as he bent over the documents I had\nbrought it occurred to me that if Mrs. Symmington had\nencountered disaster in her first marriage she had certainly played\nsafe in her second.",
    "Richard Symmington was the model of calm\nrespectability the sort of man who would never give his wife a\nmoments anxiety.",
    "A long neck with a pronounced Adams apple a\nslightly cadaverous face and a long thin nose.",
    "A kindly man no doubt a good husband and father but not one to\nset the pulses madly racing.",
    "Presently Mr. Symmington began to speak.",
    "He spoke clearly and\nslowly delivering himself of much good sense and shrewd acumen.",
    "We settled the matter in hand and I rose to go remarking as I did\nso\n\nI walked down the hill with your stepdaughter.",
    "For a moment Mr. Symmington looked as though he did not know\nwho his stepdaughter was then he smiled.",
    "Oh yes of course  Megan.",
    "She  er  has been back from school\nsome time.",
    "Were thinking about finding her something to do  yes\nto do.",
    "But of course shes very young still.",
    "And backward for her\nage so they say.",
    "Yes so they tell me.",
    "I went out.",
    "In the outer office was a very old man on a stool writing\nslowly and laboriously a small cheekylooking boy and a middleaged woman with frizzy hair and pincenez who was typing with\nsome speed and dash.",
    "If this was Miss Ginch I agreed with Owen Griffith that tender\npassages between her and her employer were exceedingly\nunlikely.",
    "I went into the bakers and said my piece about the currant loaf.",
    "It\nwas received with the exclamations and incredulity proper to the\noccasion and a new currant loaf was thrust upon me in\nreplacement  fresh from the oven this minute  as its indecent\nheat pressed against my chest proclaimed to be no less than truth.",
    "I came out of the shop and looked up and down the street hoping to\nsee Joanna with the car.",
    "The walk had tired me a good deal and it\nwas awkward getting along with my sticks and the currant loaf.",
    "But there was no sign of Joanna as yet.",
    "Suddenly my eyes were held in glad and incredulous surprise.",
    "Along the pavement toward me there came floating a goddess.",
    "There is really no other word for it.",
    "The perfect features the crisply\ncurling golden hair the tall exquisitely shaped body.",
    "And she\nwalked like a goddess without effort seeming to swim nearer and\nnearer.",
    "A glorious an incredible a breathtaking girl\n\n\fIn my intense excitement something had to go.",
    "What went was the\ncurrant loaf.",
    "It slipped from my clutches.",
    "I made a dive after it and\nlost my stick which clattered to the pavement and I slipped and\nnearly fell myself.",
    "It was the strong arm of the goddess that caught and held me.",
    "I began to stammer Ththanks awfully Im fffrightfully sorry.",
    "She had retrieved the currant loaf and handed it to me together\nwith the stick.",
    "And then she smiled kindly and said cheerfully\n\nDont mention it.",
    "No trouble I assure you and the magic died\ncompletely before the flat competent voice.",
    "A nice healthylooking well setup girl no more.",
    "I fell to reflecting what would have happened if the gods had given\nHelen of Troy exactly those flat accents.",
    "How strange that a girl\ncould trouble your inmost soul so long as she kept her mouth shut\nand that the moment she spoke the glamor could vanish as though\nit had never been.",
    "I had known the reverse happen though.",
    "I had seen a little sad\nmonkeyfaced woman whom no one would turn to look at twice.",
    "Then she had opened her mouth and suddenly enchantment had\nlived and bloomed and Cleopatra had cast her spell anew.",
    "Joanna had drawn up at the curb beside me without my noticing\nher arrival.",
    "She asked if there was anything the matter.",
    "Nothing I said pulling myself together.",
    "I was reflecting on Helen\nof Troy and others.",
    "What a funny place to do it said Joanna.",
    "You looked most odd\nstanding there clasping currant bread to your breast with your\nmouth wide open.",
    "Ive had a shock I said.",
    "I had been transplanted to Ilium and\nback again.",
    "I added indicating a retreating back that was swimming gracefully\naway\n\nDo you know who that is\n\nPeering after the girl Joanna said that it was Elsie Holland the\nSymmingtons nursery governess.",
    "Is that what struck you all of a heap she asked.",
    "Shes goodlooking but a bit of a wet fish.",
    "I know I said.",
    "Just a nice kind girl.",
    "And Id been thinking her\nAphrodite.",
    "Joanna opened the door of the car and I got in.",
    "Its funny isnt it she said.",
    "Some people have lots of looks and\nabsolutely no S. A.",
    "That girl hasnt.",
    "It seems such a pity.",
    "I said that if she was a nursery governess it was probably just as\nwell.",
    "That afternoon we went to tea with Mr. Pye.",
    "Mr. Pye was an extremely ladylike plump little man devoted to his\npetit point chairs his Dresden shepherdesses and his collection of\nperiod furniture.",
    "He lived at Priors Lodge in the grounds of which\nwere the ruins of the old Priory dissolved at the Reformation.",
    "It was hardly a mans house.",
    "The curtains and cushions were of\npastel shades in the most expensive silks.",
    "Mr. Pyes small plump hands quivered with excitement as he\ndescribed and exhibited his treasures and his voice rose to a\nfalsetto squeak as he narrated the exciting circumstances in which\nhe had brought his Italian bedstead home from Verona.",
    "Joanna and I both being fond of antiques met with approval.",
    "It is really a pleasure a great pleasure to have such an acquisition\nto our little community.",
    "The dear good people down here you\nknow so painfully bucolic  not to say provincial.",
    "Vandals  absolute\nvandals And the insides of their houses  it would make you weep\ndear lady I assure you it would make you weep.",
    "Perhaps it has\ndone so\n\nJoanna said she hadnt gone quite as far as that.",
    "The house you have taken went on Mr. Pye Miss Emily Bartons\nhouse.",
    "Now that is charming and she has some quite nice pieces.",
    "Quite nice.",
    "One or two of them are really firstclass.",
    "And she has\ntaste too  although Im not quite so sure of that as I was.",
    "Sometimes I am afraid I think its really sentiment.",
    "She likes to\nkeep things as they were  but not for le bon motif  not because of\nthe resultant harmony  but because it is the way her mother had\nthem.",
    "He transferred his attention to me and his voice changed.",
    "It altered\nfrom that of the rapt artist to that of the born gossip\n\nYou didnt know the family at all No quite so  yes through house\nagents.",
    "But my dears you ought to have known that family When I\ncame here the old mother was still alive.",
    "An incredible person quite incredible A monster if you know what I mean.",
    "Positively a\nmonster.",
    "The oldfashioned Victorian monster devouring her\nyoung.",
    "Yes thats what it amounted to.",
    "She was monumental you\nknow must have weighed seventeen stone and all the five\ndaughters revolved around her.",
    "The girls Thats how she always\nspoke of them.",
    "The girls And the eldest was well over sixty then.",
    "Those stupid girls she used to call them sometimes.",
    "Black\nslaves thats all they were fetching and carrying and agreeing with\nher.",
    "Ten oclock they had to go to bed and they werent allowed a\nfire in their bedroom and as for asking their own friends to the\nhouse that would have been unheard of.",
    "She despised them you\nknow for not getting married and yet so arranged their lives that it\nwas practically impossible for them to meet anybody.",
    "I believe\nEmily or perhaps it was Agnes did have some kind of affair with a\n\n\fcurate.",
    "But his family wasnt good enough and Mamma soon put a\nstop to that\n\nIt sounds like a novel said Joanna.",
    "Oh my dear it was.",
    "And then the dreadful old woman died but of\ncourse it was far too late then.",
    "They just went on living there and\ntalking in hushed voices about what poor Mamma would have\nwished.",
    "Even repapering her bedroom they felt to be quite\nsacrilegious.",
    "Still they did enjoy themselves in the parish in a quiet\nway...",
    "But none of them had much stamina and they just died off\none by one.",
    "Influenza took off Edith and Minnie had an operation\nand didnt recover and poor Mable had a stroke  Emily looked after\nher in the most devoted manner.",
    "Really that poor woman has done\nnothing but nursing for the last ten years.",
    "A charming creature\ndont you think Like a piece of Dresden.",
    "So sad for her having\nfinancial\n\nanxieties\n\n\n\nbut\n\nof\n\ncourse\n\nall\n\ninvestments\n\nhave\n\ndepreciated.",
    "We feel rather awful being in her house said Joanna.",
    "No no my dear young lady.",
    "You mustnt feel that way.",
    "Her dear\ngood Florence is devoted to her and she told me herself how happy\nshe was to have got such nice tenants.",
    "Here Mr. Pye made a little bow.",
    "She told me she thought she had\nbeen most fortunate.",
    "The house I said has a very soothing atmosphere.",
    "Mr. Pye\ndarted a quick glance at me.",
    "Really You feel that Now thats very interesting.",
    "I wondered you\nknow.",
    "Yes I wondered.",
    "What do you mean Mr. Pye asked Joanna.",
    "Mr. Pye spread out his plump hands.",
    "Nothing nothing.",
    "One wondered that is all.",
    "I do believe in\natmosphere you know.",
    "Peoples thoughts and feelings.",
    "They give\ntheir impression to the walls and the furniture.",
    "I did not speak for a moment or two.",
    "I was looking around me and\nwondering how I would describe the atmosphere of Priors Lodge.",
    "It\nseemed to me that the curious thing was that it hadnt any\natmosphere That was really very remarkable.",
    "I reflected on this point so long that I heard nothing of the\nconversation going on between Joanna and her host.",
    "I was recalled\nto\n\nmyself\n\nhowever\n\nby\n\nhearing\n\nJoanna\n\nuttering\n\nfarewell\n\npreliminaries.",
    "I came out of my dream and added my quota.",
    "We all went out into the hall.",
    "As we came toward the front door a\nletter came through the box and fell on the mat.",
    "Afternoon post murmured Mr. Pye as he picked it up.",
    "Now my dear young people you will come again wont you Such\na pleasure to meet some broader minds if you understand me in\nthis peaceful backwater where nothing ever happens.",
    "Shaking hands with us twice over he helped me with exaggerated\ncare into the car.",
    "Joanna took the wheel she negotiated with some\ncare the circular sweep around a plot of unblemished grass then\nwith a straight drive ahead she raised a hand to wave goodbye to\nour host where he stood on the steps of the house.",
    "I leaned forward\nto do the same.",
    "But our gesture of farewell went unheeded.",
    "Mr. Pye had opened his\nmail.",
    "He was standing staring down at the open sheet in his hand.",
    "Joanna had described him once as a plump pink cherub.",
    "He was\nstill plump but he was not looking like a cherub now.",
    "His face was a dark congested purple contorted with rage and\nsurprise.",
    "Yes and fear too.",
    "And at that moment I realized that there had been something\nfamiliar about the look of that envelope.",
    "I had not realized it at the\ntime  indeed it had been one of those things that you note\nunconsciously without knowing that you do note them.",
    "Goodness said Joanna whats bitten the poor pet\n\nI rather fancy I said that its the Hidden Hand again.",
    "She turned an astonished face toward me and the car swerved.",
    "Careful wench I said.",
    "Joanna refixed her attention on the road.",
    "She was frowning.",
    "You mean a letter like the one you got.",
    "Thats my guess.",
    "What is this place asked Joanna.",
    "It looks the most innocent\nsleepy harmless little bit of England you can imagine.",
    "Where to quote Mr. Pye nothing ever happens I cut in.",
    "He chose the wrong minute to say that.",
    "Something has happened.",
    "Jerry said Joanna.",
    "I dont think I like this.",
    "For the first time there was a note of fear in her voice.",
    "I did not answer for I too did not like it...",
    "Such a peaceful smiling happy countryside  and down underneath\nsomething evil...",
    "It was as though at that moment I had a premonition of all that was\nto come...",
    "The days passed.",
    "We went and played bridge at the Symmingtons\nand Mrs. Symmington annoyed me a good deal by the way she\nreferred to Megan.",
    "The poor childs so awkward.",
    "They are at that age when theyve\nleft school and before they are properly grown up.",
    "Joanna said sweetly\n\nBut Megans twenty isnt she\n\nOh yes yes.",
    "But of course shes very young for her age.",
    "Quite a\nchild still.",
    "Its so nice I think when girls dont grow up too quickly.",
    "She laughed.",
    "I expect all mothers want their children to remain babies.",
    "I cant think why said Joanna.",
    "After all it would be a bit awkward if one had a child who remained\nmentally six while his body grew up.",
    "Mrs. Symmington looked annoyed and said Miss Burton mustnt\ntake things so literally.",
    "I was pleased with Joanna and it occurred to me that I did not\nreally much care for Mrs. Symmington.",
    "That anaemic middleaged\nprettiness concealed I thought a selfish grasping nature.",
    "Joanna asked maliciously if Mrs. Symmington were going to give a\ndance for Megan.",
    "A dance Mrs. Symmington seemed surprised and amused.",
    "Oh no we dont do things like that down here.",
    "I see.",
    "Just tennis parties and things like that.",
    "Our tennis court has not been played on for years.",
    "Neither Richard\nnor I play.",
    "I suppose later when the boys grow up  oh Megan will\nfind plenty to do.",
    "Shes quite happy just pottering about you know.",
    "Let me see did I deal Two no trumps.",
    "As we drove home Joanna said with a vicious pressure on the\naccelerator pedal that made the car leap forward\n\nI feel awfully sorry for that girl.",
    "Megan\n\nYes.",
    "Her mother doesnt like her.",
    "Oh come now Joanna its not as bad as that.",
    "Yes it is.",
    "Lots of mothers dont like their children.",
    "Megan I should\nimagine is an awkward sort of creature to have about the house.",
    "She disturbs the pattern  the Symmington pattern.",
    "Its a complete\nunit without her  and thats a most unhappy feeling for a sensitive\ncreature to have  and she is sensitive.",
    "Yes I said I think she is.",
    "I was silent a moment.",
    "Joanna suddenly laughed mischievously.",
    "Bad luck for you about\nthe governess.",
    "I dont know what you mean I said with dignity.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Masculine chagrin was written on your face every time\nyou looked at her.",
    "I agree with you it is a waste.",
    "And I dont see\nwho else there is here for you.",
    "Youll have to fall back upon Aim\u0439e\nGriffith.",
    "God forbid I said with a shudder.",
    "And anyway I added why all this concern about my love life\nWhat about you my girl Youll need a little distraction down here if\nI know you.",
    "No unappreciated genius knocking about here.",
    "Youll\nhave to fall back on Owen Griffith.",
    "Hes the only unattached male in\nthe place.",
    "Joanna tossed her head.",
    "Dr. Griffith doesnt like me.",
    "Hes not seen much of you.",
    "Hes seen enough apparently to make him cross over if he sees me\ncoming along the High Street\n\nA most unusual reaction I said sympathetically.",
    "And one youre\nnot used to.",
    "Joanna drove in silence through the gate of Little Furze and around\nto the garage.",
    "Then she said\n\nThere may be something in that idea of yours.",
    "I dont see why any\nman should deliberately cross the street to avoid me.",
    "Its rude\napart from everything else.",
    "I see I said.",
    "Youre going to hunt the man down in cold blood.",
    "Well I dont like being avoided.",
    "I got slowly and carefully out of the car and balanced my sticks.",
    "Then I offered my sister a piece of advice\n\nLet me tell you this girl.",
    "Owen Griffith isnt any of your tame\nwhining artistic young men.",
    "Unless youre careful youll stir up a\nhornets nest about your ears.",
    "That man could be dangerous.",
    "Oh do you think so demanded Joanna with every symptom of\npleasure at the prospect.",
    "Leave the poor devil alone I said sternly.",
    "How dare he cross the street when he saw me coming\n\nAll you women are alike.",
    "You harp on one theme.",
    "Youll have sister\nAim\u0439e gunning for you too if Im not mistaken.",
    "She dislikes me already said Joanna.",
    "She spoke meditatively but\nwith a certain satisfaction.",
    "We have come down here I said sternly for peace and quiet\nand I mean to see we get it.",
    "But peace and quiet were the last things we were to have.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nIt was about a week later that I came back to the house to find\nMegan sitting on the veranda steps her chin resting on her knees.",
    "She greeted me with her usual lack of ceremony.",
    "Hullo she said.",
    "Do you think I could come to lunch\n\nCertainly I said.",
    "If its chops or anything difficult like that and they wont go round\njust tell me shouted Megan as I went around to apprise Partridge\nof the fact that there would be three to lunch.",
    "I fancy that Partridge sniffed.",
    "She certainly managed to convey\nwithout saying a word of any kind that she didnt think much of that\nMiss Megan.",
    "I went back to the veranda.",
    "Is it all right asked Megan anxiously.",
    "Quite all right I said.",
    "Irish stew.",
    "Oh well thats rather like dogs dinner anyway isnt it I mean its\nmostly potato and flavour.",
    "Quite I said.",
    "We were silent while I smoked my pipe.",
    "It was quite a\ncompanionable silence.",
    "Megan broke it by saying suddenly and violently I suppose you\nthink Im awful like everyone else.",
    "I was so startled that my pipe fell out of my mouth.",
    "It was a\nmeerschaum just colouring nicely and it broke.",
    "I said angrily to\nMegan\n\nNow see what youve done.",
    "That most unaccountable of children instead of being upset\nmerely grinned broadly.",
    "I do like you she said.",
    "It was a most warming remark.",
    "It is the remark that one fancies\nperhaps erroneously that ones dog would say if he could talk.",
    "It\n\n\foccurred to me that Megan for all she looked like a horse had the\ndisposition of a dog.",
    "She was certainly not quite human.",
    "What did you say before the catastrophe I asked carefully\npicking up the fragments of my cherished pipe.",
    "I said I supposed you thought me awful said Megan but not at all\nin the same tone she had said it before.",
    "Why should I\n\nMegan said gravely Because I am.",
    "I said sharply Dont be stupid.",
    "Megan shook her head.",
    "Thats just it.",
    "Im not really stupid.",
    "People think I am.",
    "They dont\nknow that inside I know just what theyre like and that all the time\nIm hating them.",
    "Hating them\n\nYes said Megan.",
    "Her eyes those melancholy unchildlike eyes stared straight into\nmine without blinking.",
    "It was a long mournful gaze.",
    "You would hate people if you were like me she said.",
    "If you\nwerent wanted.",
    "Dont you think youre being rather morbid I asked.",
    "Yes said Megan.",
    "Thats what people always say when youre\nsaying the truth.",
    "And it is true.",
    "Im not wanted and I can quite see\nwhy.",
    "Mummie doesnt like me a bit.",
    "I remind her I think of my\nfather who was cruel to her and pretty dreadful from all I can hear.",
    "Only mothers cant say they dont want their children and just go\naway.",
    "Or eat them.",
    "Cats eat the kittens they dont like.",
    "Awfully\nsensible I think.",
    "No waste or mess.",
    "But human mothers have to\nkeep their children and look after them.",
    "It hasnt been so bad while\nI could be sent away to school  but you see what Mummie would\nreally like is to be just herself and my stepfather and the boys.",
    "I said slowly I still think youre morbid Megan but accepting some\nof what you say as true why dont you go away and have a life of\nyour own\n\nShe gave me an odd unchildlike smile.",
    "You mean take up a career.",
    "Earn my living\n\nYes.",
    "What at\n\nYou could train for something I suppose.",
    "Shorthand typing\nbookkeeping.",
    "I dont believe I could.",
    "I am stupid about doing things.",
    "And besides\n\n\n\fWell\n\nShe had turned her head away now she turned it slowly back\nagain.",
    "It was crimson and there were tears in her eyes.",
    "She spoke now with all the childishness back in her voice\n\nWhy should I go away And be made to go away They dont want\nme but Ill stay.",
    "Ill stay and make everyone sorry.",
    "Ill make them all\nsorry.",
    "Hateful pigs I hate everyone here in Lymstock.",
    "They all think\nIm stupid and ugly.",
    "Ill show them Ill show them Ill \n\nIt was a childish oddly pathetic rage.",
    "I heard a step on the gravel around the corner of the house.",
    "Get up I said savagely.",
    "Go into the house through the drawing\nroom.",
    "Go up to the bathroom.",
    "Wash your face.",
    "Quick.",
    "She sprang awkwardly to her feet and darted through the window\nas Joanna came around the corner of the house.",
    "I told her Megan had come to lunch.",
    "Good said Joanna I like Megan though I rather think shes a\nchangeling.",
    "Something left on a doorstep by the fairies.",
    "But shes\ninteresting.",
    "I see that so far I have made little mention of the Reverend and Mrs.\nCalthrop.",
    "And yet both the vicar and his wife were distinct personalities.",
    "Dane Calthrop himself was perhaps a being more remote from\neveryday life than anyone I have ever met.",
    "His existence was in his\nbooks and in his study.",
    "Mrs. Dane Calthrop on the other hand was\nquite terrifyingly on the spot.",
    "Though she seldom gave advice and\nnever interfered yet she represented to the uneasy consciences of\nthe village the Deity personified.",
    "She stopped me in the High Street the day after Megan had come to\nlunch.",
    "I had the usual feeling of surprise because Mrs. Dane\nCalthrops progress resembled coursing more than walking thus\naccording with her startling resemblance to a greyhound and as\nher eyes were always fixed on the distant horizon you felt sure that\nher real objective was about a mile and a half away.",
    "Oh she said.",
    "Mr. Burton\n\nShe said it rather triumphantly as someone might who had solved a\nparticularly clever puzzle.",
    "I admitted that I was Mr. Burton and Mrs.\nDane Calthrop stopped focusing on the horizon and seemed to be\ntrying to focus on me instead.",
    "Now what she said did I want to see you about\n\nI could not help her there.",
    "She stood frowning deeply perplexed.",
    "Something rather nasty she said.",
    "Im sorry about that I said startled.",
    "Ah cried Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "Anonymous letters Whats this\nstory youve brought down here about anonymous letters\n\nI didnt bring it I said it was here already.",
    "Nobody got any until you came though said Mrs. Dane Calthrop\naccusingly.",
    "But they did Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "The trouble had already\nstarted.",
    "Oh dear said Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "I dont like that.",
    "She stood there her eyes absent and far away again.",
    "She said\n\nI cant help feeling its all wrong.",
    "Were not like that here.",
    "Envy of\ncourse and malice and all the mean spiteful little sins  but I didnt\nthink there was anyone who would do that.",
    "No I really didnt.",
    "And it\ndistresses me you see because I ought to know.",
    "Her fine eyes came back from the horizon and met mine.",
    "They were worried and seemed to hold the honest bewilderment of\na childs.",
    "Why ought you to know I said.",
    "I usually do.",
    "Ive always felt thats my function.",
    "Caleb preaches\ngood sound doctrine and administers the sacraments.",
    "Thats a\npriests duty but if you admit marriage at all for a priest then I think\nhis wifes duty is to know what people are feeling and thinking even\nif she cant do anything about it.",
    "And I havent the least idea whose\nmind is \n\nShe broke off adding absently They are such silly letters too.",
    "Have you  er  had any yourself\n\nI was a little diffident of asking but Mrs. Dane Calthrop replied\nperfectly naturally her eyes opening a little wider\n\nOh yes two  no three.",
    "I forget exactly what they said.",
    "Something\nvery silly about Caleb and the schoolmistress I think.",
    "Quite absurd\nbecause Caleb has absolutely no taste for flirtation.",
    "He never has\nhad.",
    "So lucky being a clergyman.",
    "Quite I said oh quite.",
    "Caleb would have been a saint said Mrs. Dane Calthrop if he\nhadnt been just a little too intellectual.",
    "I did not feel qualified to answer this criticism and anyway Mrs.\nDane Calthrop went on leaping back from her husband to the\nletters in rather a puzzling way.",
    "There are so many things the letters might say but dont.",
    "Thats\nwhat is so curious.",
    "I should hardly have thought they erred on the side of restraint I\nsaid bitterly.",
    "But they dont seem to know anything.",
    "None of the real things.",
    "You mean\n\nThose fine vague eyes met mine.",
    "Well of course.",
    "Theres plenty of wrongdoing here  any amount of\nshameful secrets.",
    "Why doesnt the writer use those\n\nShe paused and then asked abruptly What did they say in your\nletter\n\nThey suggested that my sister wasnt my sister.",
    "And she is\n\nMrs. Dane Calthrop asked the question with unembarrassed\nfriendly interest.",
    "Certainly Joanna is my sister.",
    "Mrs. Dane Calthrop nodded her head.",
    "That just shows you what I\nmean.",
    "I daresay there are other things \n\n\fHer clear uninterested eyes looked at me thoughtfully and I\nsuddenly understood why Lymstock was afraid of Mrs. Dane\nCalthrop.",
    "In everybodys life there are hidden chapters which they hope may\nnever be known.",
    "I felt that Mrs. Dane Calthrop knew them.",
    "For once in my life I was positively delighted when Aim\u0439e Griffiths\nhearty voice boomed out\n\nHullo Maud.",
    "Glad Ive just caught you.",
    "I want to suggest an\nalteration of date for the Sale of Work.",
    "Morning Mr. Burton.",
    "She went on\n\nI must just pop into the grocers and leave my order then Ill come\nalong to the Institute if that suits you\n\nYes yes that will do quite well said Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "Aim\u0439e\nGriffith went into the International Stores.",
    "Mrs. Dane Calthrop said Poor thing.",
    "I was puzzled.",
    "Surely she could not be pitying Aim\u0439e\n\nShe went on however You know Mr. Burton Im rather afraid \n\nAbout this letter business\n\nYes you see it means  it must mean \n\n\fShe paused lost in thought her eyes screwed up.",
    "Then she said\nslowly as one who solves a problem Blind hatred... yes blind\nhatred.",
    "But even a blind man might stab to the heart by pure\nchance... And what would happen then Mr. Burton\n\nWe were to know that before another day had passed.",
    "Partridge who enjoys calamity came into Joannas room at an\nearly hour the following morning and told her with considerable\nrelish that Mrs. Symmington had committed suicide on the\npreceding afternoon.",
    "Joanna who had been lost in the mists of sleep sat up in bed\nshocked wide awake.",
    "Oh Partridge how awful.",
    "Awful it is Miss.",
    "Its wickedness taking your own life.",
    "Not but what\nshe was drove to it poor soul.",
    "Joanna had an inkling of the truth then.",
    "She felt rather sick.",
    "Not   Her eyes questioned Partridge and Partridge nodded.",
    "Thats right Miss.",
    "One of them nasty letters.",
    "How beastly said Joanna.",
    "How absolutely beastly All the same\nI dont see why she should kill herself for a letter like that.",
    "Looks as though what was in the letter was true Miss.",
    "What was in it\n\nBut that Partridge couldnt or wouldnt say.",
    "Joanna came in to me\nlooking white and shocked.",
    "It seemed worse somehow that Mrs.\nSymmington was not the kind of person you associated with\ntragedy.",
    "Joanna suggested that we might ask Megan to come to us for a day\nor two.",
    "Elsie Holland she said would be all right with the children\nbut was the kind of person who would almost certainly drive\nMegan half mad.",
    "I agreed.",
    "I could imagine Elsie Holland uttering platitude after\nplatitude and suggesting innumerable cups of tea.",
    "A kindly creature but not the right person for Megan.",
    "We drove\ndown to the Symmingtons house after breakfast.",
    "We were both of us a little nervous.",
    "Our arrival might look like sheer\nghoulish curiosity.",
    "Luckily we met Owen Griffith just coming out.",
    "He\ngreeted me with some warmth his worried face lighting up.",
    "Oh hullo Burton Im glad to see you.",
    "What I was afraid would\nhappen sooner or later has happened.",
    "A damnable business\n\nGood morning Dr. Griffith said Joanna using the voice she\nkeeps for one of our deafer aunts.",
    "Griffith started and flushed.",
    "Oh  oh good morning Miss Burton.",
    "I thought perhaps said Joanna that you didnt see me.",
    "Owen Griffith got redder still.",
    "His shyness enveloped him like a\nmantle.",
    "Im  Im so sorry  preoccupied  I didnt.",
    "Joanna went on mercilessly.",
    "After all I am lifesize.",
    "Merely kitkat I said in a stern aside to her.",
    "Then I went on\n\nMy sister and I Griffith wondered whether it would be a good\nthing if the girl came and stopped with us for a day or two What do\nyou think I dont want to butt in  but it must be rather grim for the\npoor child.",
    "What would Symmington feel about it do you think\n\nGriffith turned the idea over in his mind for a moment or two.",
    "I think it would be an excellent thing he said at last.",
    "Shes a queer nervous sort of girl and it would be good for her to\nget away from the whole thing.",
    "Miss Holland is doing wonders shes an excellent head on her shoulders but she really has quite\nenough to do with the two children and Symmington himself.",
    "Hes\nquite broken up  bewildered.",
    "It was  I hesitated  suicide\n\nGriffith nodded.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "No question of accident.",
    "She wrote I cant go on on a\nscrap of paper.",
    "The letter must have come by yesterday afternoons\npost.",
    "The envelope was down on the floor by her chair and the\nletter itself was screwed up into a ball and thrown into the\nfireplace.",
    "What did \n\nI stopped rather horrified at myself.",
    "I beg your pardon I said.",
    "Griffith gave a quick unhappy smile.",
    "You neednt mind asking.",
    "That letter will have to be read at the\ninquest.",
    "No getting out of it mores the pity.",
    "It was the usual kind of\nthing  couched in the same foul style.",
    "The specific accusation was\nthat the second boy Colin was not Symmingtons child.",
    "Do you think that was true I exclaimed incredulously.",
    "Griffith shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Ive no means of forming a judgement.",
    "Ive only been here five\nyears.",
    "As far as Ive ever seen the Symmingtons were a placid\n\n\fhappy couple devoted to each other and their children.",
    "Its true that\nthe boy doesnt particularly resemble his parents  hes got bright\nred hair for one thing  but a child often throws back in appearance\nto a grandfather or grandmother.",
    "That lack of resemblance might have been what prompted the\nparticular accusation.",
    "A foul and quite uncalledfor blow at a\nventure.",
    "But it happened to hit the bullseye said Joanna.",
    "After all she\nwouldnt have killed herself otherwise would she\n\nGriffith said doubtfully\n\nIm not quite sure.",
    "Shes been ailing in health for some time neurotic hysterical.",
    "Ive been treating her for a nervous condition.",
    "Its possible I think that the shock of receiving such a letter\ncouched in those terms may have induced such a state of panic\nand despondency that she may have decided to take her life.",
    "She\nmay have worked herself up to feel that her husband might not\nbelieve her if she denied the story and the general shame and\ndisgust might have worked upon her so powerfully as to unbalance\nher judgement temporarily.",
    "Suicide while of unsound mind said Joanna.",
    "Exactly.",
    "I shall be quite justified I think in putting forward that\npoint of view at the inquest.",
    "Joanna and I went on into the house.",
    "The front door was open and it seemed easier than ringing the bell\nespecially as we heard Elsie Hollands voice inside.",
    "She was talking to Mr. Symmington who huddled in a chair was\nlooking completely dazed.",
    "No but really Mr. Symmington you must take something.",
    "You\nhavent had any breakfast not what I call a proper breakfast and\nnothing to eat last night and what with the shock and all youll be\ngetting ill yourself and youll need all your strength.",
    "The doctor\nsaid so before he left.",
    "Symmington said in a toneless voice Youre very kind Miss\nHolland but \n\nA nice cup of hot tea said Elsie Holland thrusting the beverage\non him firmly.",
    "Personally I should have given the poor devil a stiff whiskyandsoda.",
    "He looked as though he needed it.",
    "However he accepted the\ntea and looking up at Elsie Holland\n\nI cant thank you for all youve done and are doing Miss Holland.",
    "Youve been perfectly splendid.",
    "The girl flushed and looked pleased.",
    "Its nice of you to say that Mr. Symmington.",
    "You must let me do all\nI can to help.",
    "Dont worry about the children  Ill see to them and\n\n\fIve got the servants calmed down and if theres anything I can do\nletterwriting or telephoning dont hesitate to ask me.",
    "Youre very kind Symmington said again.",
    "Elsie Holland turning caught sight of us and came hurrying out\ninto the hall.",
    "Isnt it terrible she said in a hushed whisper.",
    "I thought as I looked at her that she was really a very nice girl.",
    "Kind competent practical in an emergency.",
    "Her magnificent blue\neyes were just faintly rimmed with pink showing that she had been\nsofthearted enough to shed tears for her employers death.",
    "Can we speak to you a minute asked Joanna.",
    "We dont want to disturb Mr. Symmington.",
    "Elsie Holland nodded comprehendingly and led the way into the\ndining room on the other side of the hall.",
    "Its been awful for him she said.",
    "Such a shock.",
    "Who ever would\nhave thought a thing like this could happen But of course I do\nrealize now that she had been queer for some time.",
    "Awfully nervous\nand weepy.",
    "I thought it was her health though Dr. Griffith always\nsaid there was nothing really wrong with her.",
    "But she was snappy\nand irritable and some days you wouldnt know just how to take\nher.",
    "What we really came for said Joanna was to know whether we\ncould have Megan for a few days  that is if shed like to come.",
    "Elsie Holland looked rather surprised.",
    "Megan she said doubtfully.",
    "I dont know Im sure.",
    "I mean its\never so kind of you but shes such a queer girl.",
    "One never knows\nwhat shes going to say or feel about things.",
    "Joanna said rather vaguely We thought it might be a help\nperhaps.",
    "Oh well as far as that goes it would.",
    "I mean Ive got the boys to\nlook after theyre with cook just now and poor Mr. Symmington he really needs looking after as much as anyone and such a lot to\ndo and see to.",
    "I really havent had time to say much to Megan.",
    "I\nthink shes upstairs in the old nursery at the top of the house.",
    "She\nseems to want to get away from everyone.",
    "I dont know if \n\nJoanna gave me the faintest of looks.",
    "I slipped quickly out of the\nroom and upstairs.",
    "The old nursery was at the top of the house.",
    "I opened the door and\nwent in.",
    "The room downstairs had given on to the garden behind\nand the blinds had not been down there.",
    "But in this room which\nfaced the road they were decorously drawn down.",
    "Through a dim gray gloom I saw Megan.",
    "She was crouching on a\ndivan set against the far wall and I was reminded at once of some\nterrified animal hiding.",
    "She looked petrified with fear.",
    "Megan I said.",
    "I came forward and unconsciously I adopted the tone one does\nadopt when you want to reassure a frightened animal.",
    "Im really surprised I didnt hold out a carrot or a piece of sugar.",
    "I\nfelt like that.",
    "She stared at me but she did not move and her expression did not\nalter.",
    "Megan I said again.",
    "Joanna and I have come to ask you if you\nwould like to come and stay with us for a little.",
    "Her voice came hollowly out of the dim twilight\n\nStay with you In your house\n\nYes.",
    "You mean youll take me away from here\n\nYes my dear.",
    "Suddenly she began to shake all over.",
    "It was frightening and very\nmoving.",
    "Oh do take me away Please do.",
    "Its so awful being here and\nfeeling so wicked.",
    "I came over to her and her hands fastened on my coat sleeve.",
    "Im an awful coward.",
    "I didnt know what a coward I was.",
    "Its all right funnyface I said.",
    "These things are a bit shattering.",
    "Come along.",
    "Can we go at once Without waiting a minute\n\nWell youll have to put a few things together I suppose.",
    "What sort of things Why\n\nMy dear girl I said.",
    "We can provide you with a bed and a bath\nand the rest of it but Im darned if I lend you my toothbrush.",
    "She gave a very faint weak little laugh.",
    "I see.",
    "I think Im stupid today.",
    "You mustnt mind.",
    "Ill go and pack\nsome things.",
    "You  you wont go away Youll wait for me\n\nIll be on the mat.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "Im sorry Im so stupid.",
    "But you\nsee its rather dreadful when your mother dies.",
    "I know I said.",
    "I gave her a friendly pat on the back and she flashed me a grateful\nlook and disappeared into a bedroom.",
    "I went on downstairs.",
    "Ifound Megan I said.",
    "Shes coming.",
    "Oh now that is a good thing exclaimed Elsie Holland.",
    "It will take her out of herself.",
    "Shes rather a nervy girl you know.",
    "Difficult.",
    "It will be a great relief to feel I havent got her on my mind\nas well as everything else.",
    "Its very kind of you Miss Burton.",
    "I hope\nshe wont be a nuisance.",
    "Oh dear theres the telephone.",
    "I must go\nand answer it.",
    "Mr. Symmington isnt fit.",
    "She hurried out of the room.",
    "Joanna said Quite the ministering angel\n\nYou said that rather nastily I observed.",
    "Shes a nice kind girl\nand obviously most capable.",
    "Most.",
    "And she knows it.",
    "This is unworthy of you Joanna I said.",
    "Meaning why shouldnt the girl do her stuff\n\nExactly.",
    "I never can stand seeing people pleased with themselves said\nJoanna.",
    "It arouses all my worst instincts.",
    "How did you find Megan\n\nCrouching in a darkened room looking rather like a stricken\ngazelle.",
    "Poor kid.",
    "She was quite willing to come\n\nShe leaped at it.",
    "A series of thuds out in the hall announced the descent of Megan\nand her suitcase.",
    "I went out and took it from her.",
    "Joanna behind me said urgently Come on.",
    "Ive already refused\nsome nice hot tea twice.",
    "We went out to the car.",
    "It annoyed me that Joanna had to sling the\nsuitcase in.",
    "I could get along with one stick now but I couldnt do\nany athletic feats.",
    "Get in I said to Megan.",
    "She got in I followed her.",
    "Joanna started the car and we drove off.",
    "We got to Little Furze and went into the drawing room.",
    "Megan\ndropped into a chair and burst into tears.",
    "She cried with the hearty\nfervour of a child  bawled I think is the right word.",
    "I left the room\nin search of a remedy.",
    "Joanna stood by feeling rather helpless I\nthink.",
    "Presently I heard Megan say in a thick choked voice Im sorry for\ndoing this.",
    "It seems idiotic.",
    "Joanna said kindly Not at all.",
    "Have another handkerchief.",
    "I gather she supplied the necessary article.",
    "I reentered the room\nand handed Megan a brimming glass.",
    "What is it\n\nA cocktail I said.",
    "Is it Is it really Megans tears were instantly dried.",
    "Ive never\ndrunk a cocktail.",
    "Everything has to have a beginning I said.",
    "Megan sipped her drink gingerly then a beaming smile spread over\nher face she tilted her head back and gulped it down at a draught.",
    "Its lovely she said.",
    "Can I have another\n\nNo I said.",
    "Why not\n\nIn about ten minutes youll probably know.",
    "Oh\n\n\fMegan transferred her attention to Joanna.",
    "I really am awfully sorry for having made such a nuisance of myself\nhowling away like that.",
    "I cant think why.",
    "It seems awfully silly when\nIm so glad to be here.",
    "Thats all right said Joanna.",
    "Were very pleased to have you.",
    "You cant be really.",
    "Its just kindness on your part.",
    "But I am\ngrateful.",
    "Please dont be grateful said Joanna it will embarrass me.",
    "Youre our friend and were glad to have you here.",
    "Thats all there is\nto it... \n\nShe took Megan upstairs to unpack.",
    "Partridge came in looking sour and said she had made two cup\ncustards for lunch and what should she do about it\n\nThe inquest was held three days later.",
    "The time of Mrs. Symmingtons death was put at between three and\nfour oclock.",
    "She was alone in the house Symmington was at his\noffice the maids were having their day out Elsie Holland and the\nchildren were out walking and Megan had gone for a bicycle ride.",
    "The letter must have come by the afternoon post.",
    "Mrs. Symmington\nmust have taken it out of the box read it  and then in a state of\n\n\fagitation she had gone to the potting shed fetched some of the\ncyanide kept there for taking wasps nests dissolved it in water and\ndrunk it after writing those last agitated words I cant go on...\n\nOwen Griffith gave medical evidence and stressed the view he had\noutlined to us of Mrs. Symmingtons nervous condition and poor\nstamina.",
    "The coroner was suave and discreet.",
    "He spoke with bitter condemnation of people who write those\ndespicable things anonymous letters.",
    "Whoever had written that\nwicked and lying letter was morally guilty of murder he said.",
    "He\nhoped the police would soon discover the culprit and take action\nagainst him or her.",
    "Such a dastardly and malicious piece of spite\ndeserved to be punished with the utmost rigour of the law.",
    "Directed\nby him the jury brought in the inevitable verdict Suicide while\ntemporarily insane.",
    "The coroner had done his best  Owen Griffith also but afterward\njammed in the crowd of eager village women I heard the same\nhateful sibilant whisper I had begun to know so well\n\nNo smoke without fire thats what I say... Must a been something\nin it for certain sure.",
    "She wouldnt never have done it otherwise... \n\nJust for a moment I hated Lymstock and its narrow boundaries and\nits gossipping whispering women.",
    "Outside Aim\u0439e Griffith said with a sigh\n\n\fWell thats over.",
    "Bad luck on Dick Symmington its all having to\ncome out.",
    "I wonder whether hed ever had any suspicion.",
    "I was startled.",
    "But surely you heard him say most emphatically that there wasnt a\nword of truth in that lying letter\n\nOf course he said so.",
    "Quite right.",
    "A mans got to stick up for his\nwife.",
    "Dick would.",
    "She paused and then explained\n\nYou see Ive known Dick Symmington a long time.",
    "Really I said surprised.",
    "I understood from your brother that he\nonly bought this practice a few years ago.",
    "Yes but Dick Symmington used to come and stay in our part of the\nworld up north.",
    "Ive known him for years.",
    "I looked at Aim\u0439e curiously.",
    "She went on still in that softened tone\nI know Dick very well... Hes a proud man and very reserved.",
    "But\nhes the sort of man who could be very jealous.",
    "That would explain I said deliberately why Mrs. Symmington\nwas afraid to show him or tell him about the letter.",
    "She was afraid\nthat being a jealous man he might not believe her denials.",
    "Miss Griffith looked at me angrily and scornfully.",
    "Good Lord she\nsaid.",
    "Do you think any woman would go and swallow a lot of cyanide of\npotassium for an accusation that wasnt true\n\nThe coroner seemed to think it was possible.",
    "Your brother too \n\nAim\u0439e interrupted me\n\nMen are all alike.",
    "All for preserving the decencies.",
    "But you dont\ncatch me believing that stuff.",
    "If an innocent woman gets some foul\nanonymous letter she laughs and chucks it away.",
    "Thats what I \nshe paused suddenly and then finished  would do.",
    "But I had noticed the pause.",
    "I was almost sure that what she had\nbeen about to say was Thats what I did.",
    "I decided to take the war into the enemys country.",
    "I see I said pleasantly.",
    "So youve had one too\n\nAim\u0439e Griffith was the type of woman who scorns to lie.",
    "She paused a minute  flushed then said Well yes.",
    "But I didnt let\nit worry me\n\nNasty I inquired sympathetically as a fellow sufferer.",
    "Naturally.",
    "These things always are.",
    "The ravings of a lunatic I read\na few words of it realized what it was and chucked it straight into\nthe wastepaper basket.",
    "You didnt think of taking it to the police\n\nNot then.",
    "Least said soonest mended  thats what I felt.",
    "An urge came over me to say solemnly No smoke without fire\nbut I restrained myself.",
    "I asked her if she had any idea how her mothers death would affect\nMegan financially.",
    "Would it be necessary for the girl to earn her\nown living\n\nI believe she has a small income left her by her grandmother and\nof course Dick would always give her a home.",
    "But it would be much\nbetter for her to do something  not just slack about the way she\ndoes.",
    "I should have said Megan is at the age when a girl wants to enjoy\nherself  not to work.",
    "Aim\u0439e flushed and said sharply Youre like all men  you dislike the\nidea of women competing.",
    "It is incredible to you that women should\nwant a career.",
    "It was incredible to my parents.",
    "I was anxious to\nstudy for a doctor.",
    "They would not hear of paying the fees.",
    "But they\npaid them readily for Owen.",
    "Yet I should have made a better doctor\nthan my brother.",
    "Im sorry about that I said.",
    "It was tough on you.",
    "If one wants to\ndo a thing \n\nShe went on quickly.",
    "Oh Ive got over it now.",
    "Ive plenty of willpower.",
    "My life is busy and\nactive.",
    "Im one of the happiest people in Lymstock.",
    "Plenty to do.",
    "But\nI go up in arms against the silly oldfashioned prejudice that\nwomans place is always the home.",
    "Im sorry if I offended you I said.",
    "I had had no idea that Aim\u0439e\nGriffith could be so vehement.",
    "Chapter 3\n\nI met Symmington in the town later in the day.",
    "Is it quite all right for Megan to stay on with us for a bit I asked.",
    "Its company for Joanna  shes rather lonely sometimes with none\nof her own friends.",
    "Oh  er  Megan Oh yes very good of you.",
    "I took a dislike to Symmington then which I never quite overcame.",
    "He had so obviously forgotten all about Megan.",
    "I wouldnt have\nminded if he had actively disliked the girl  a man may sometimes be\njealous of a first husbands child  but he didnt dislike her he just\nhardly noticed her.",
    "He felt toward her much as a man who doesnt\ncare much for dogs would feel about a dog in the house.",
    "You notice\nit when you fall over it and swear at it and you give it a vague pat\nsometimes when it presents itself to be patted.",
    "Symmingtons\ncomplete indifference to his stepdaughter annoyed me very much.",
    "I said What are you planning to do with her\n\nWith Megan He seemed rather startled.",
    "Well shell go on living\nat home.",
    "I mean naturally it is her home.",
    "My grandmother of whom I had been very fond used to sing oldfashioned songs to her guitar.",
    "One of them I remember ended\nthus\n\nOh maid most dear I am not here\n\nI have no place no part\n\nNo dwelling more by sea nor shore\n\nBut only in your heart.",
    "I went home humming it.",
    "Emily Barton came just after tea had been cleared away.",
    "I wanted\nto talk about the garden.",
    "We talked garden for about half an hour.",
    "Then we turned back\ntoward the hothouse.",
    "It was then that lowering her voice she murmured I do hope that\nthat child  that she hasnt been too much upset by all his dreadful\nbusiness\n\nHer mothers death you mean\n\nThat of course.",
    "But I really meant the  the unpleasantness\nbehind it.",
    "I was curious.",
    "I wanted Miss Bartons reaction.",
    "What do you think about that Was it true\n\nOh no no surely not.",
    "Im quite sure that  Mrs. Symmington never\n that he wasnt  little Emily Barton was pink and confused \n\nI mean its quite untrue  although of course it may have been a\njudgement.",
    "Judgement I said staring.",
    "Emily Barton was very pink very Dresdenchinashepherdesslike.",
    "I cannot help feeling that all these dreadful letters all the sorrow\nand pain they have caused may have been sent for a purpose.",
    "They were sent for a purpose certainly I said grimly.",
    "No no Mr. Burton you misunderstand me.",
    "Im not talking of the\nmisguided creature who wrote them  someone quite abandoned\n\n\fthat must be.",
    "I mean that they have been permitted  by Providence\nTo awaken us to a sense of our shortcomings.",
    "Surely I said the Almighty could choose a less unsavoury\nweapon.",
    "Miss Emily murmured that God moved in a mysterious way.",
    "No I said.",
    "Theres too much tendency to attribute to God the\nevils that man does of his own free will.",
    "I might concede you the\nDevil.",
    "God doesnt really need to punish us Miss Barton.",
    "Were so\nvery busy punishing ourselves.",
    "What I cant make out is why should anyone want to do such a\nthing\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.",
    "A warped mentality.",
    "It seems very sad.",
    "It doesnt seem to me sad.",
    "It seems to me just damnable.",
    "And I\ndont apologise for the word.",
    "I mean just that.",
    "The pink had gone out of Miss Bartons cheeks.",
    "They were very\nwhite.",
    "But why Mr. Burton why What pleasure can anyone get out of\nit\n\n\fNothing you and I can understand thank goodness.",
    "Emily Barton lowered her voice\n\nNothing of this kind has ever happened before  never in my\nmemory.",
    "It has been such a happy little community.",
    "What would my\ndear mother have said Well one must be thankful that she has\nbeen spared.",
    "I thought from all I had heard that old Mrs. Barton had been\nsufficiently tough to have taken anything and would probably have\nenjoyed this sensation.",
    "Emily went on It distresses me deeply.",
    "Havent you rerereceived anything\n\nShe went red again.",
    "Oh no no.",
    "That would have been awful.",
    "I hastened to apologise but she withdrew seeming a bit annoyed.",
    "I went into the house.",
    "Joanna was standing in front of the fireplace\nin the living room that she had just lit for the evenings were still\ncool.",
    "In her hands there was an open letter.",
    "When I came in she turned her head quickly.",
    "Jerry I found this in the mailbox.",
    "It begins thus You shameless\nwhore...\n\nWhat else\n\nJoanna made a face\n\nThe usual filth.",
    "She threw the letter into the fire.",
    "With a quick dash that hurt my\nback I was able to retrieve it before it hit the flames.",
    "Dont do this.",
    "I said.",
    "We might need it.",
    "Need it\n\nFor the police.",
    "Superintendent Nash came to see me the next morning.",
    "I liked him\nat first sight.",
    "He was a top quality criminal investigator.",
    "Tall with a\nmilitary way he looked tranquil and objective besides being very\nsimple.",
    "Good morning Mr. Burton he said.",
    "I expect you know why I am\ncalling.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "The letter.",
    "He nodded his head.",
    "You got one right\n\nYes immediately after we arrived here.",
    "What did it say exactly\n\nI thought a minute then conscientiously repeated the wording of\nthe letter as closely as possible.",
    "The superintendent listened with an immovable face showing no\nsigns of any kind of emotion.",
    "When I had finished he said I see.",
    "You didnt keep the letter Mr.\nBurton\n\nIm sorry I didnt.",
    "You see I thought it was just an isolated\ninstance of spite against newcomers to the place.",
    "The superintendent inclined his head comprehendingly.",
    "A pity he said briefly.",
    "However I said my sister got one yesterday.",
    "I just stopped her\nbutting it in the fire.",
    "Thank you Mr. Burton that was thoughtful of you.",
    "I went across to the desk and unlocked the drawer in which I had\nput it.",
    "It was just I thought very suitable for Partridges eyes.",
    "I\ngave it to Nash.",
    "He read it through.",
    "Then he looked up and asked\n\nIs this the same appearance as the last one\n\nI think so  as far as I can remember.",
    "The same difference between the envelope and the text\n\nYes I said.",
    "The envelope was typed.",
    "The letter itself had printed words pasted\nonto a sheet of paper.",
    "Nash folded and put it in his pocket.",
    "Then he said\n\nI wonder Mr. Burton if you would mind coming down to the station\nwith me We could have a conference there and it would save a\ngood deal of tire and overlapping.",
    "Certainly I said.",
    "You would like me to come now\n\nIf you dont mind.",
    "There was a police car at the door.",
    "We drove down in it.",
    "I said Do you think youll be able to get to the bottom of this\n\nNash nodded with easy confidence.",
    "Oh yes well get to the\nbottom of it all right.",
    "Its a question of time and routine.",
    "Theyre\nslow these cases but theyre pretty sure.",
    "Its a matter of narrowing\nthings down.",
    "Elimination I said.",
    "Yes.",
    "And general routine.",
    "Watching post boxes examining typewriters fingerprints all\nthat\n\nHe smiled.",
    "As you say.",
    "At the police station I found Symmington and Griffith were already\nthere.",
    "I was introduced to a tall lanternjawed man in plain clothes\nInspector Graves.",
    "Inspector Graves explained Nash has come down from London\nto help us.",
    "Hes an expert on anonymous letter cases.",
    "Inspector Graves smiled mournfully.",
    "I reflected that a life spent in\nthe pursuit of anonymous letter writers must be singularly\ndepressing.",
    "Inspector Graves however showed a kind of\nmelancholy enthusiasm.",
    "Theyre all the same these cases he said in a deep lugubrious\nvoice like a depressed bloodhound.",
    "Youd be surprised.",
    "The\nwording of the letters and the things they say.",
    "We had a case just on two years ago said Nash.",
    "Inspector\nGraves helped us then.",
    "Some of the letters I saw were spread out on the table in front of\nGraves.",
    "He had evidently been examining them.",
    "Difficulty is said Nash to get hold of the letters.",
    "Either people\nput them in the fire or they wont admit to having received anything\nof the kind.",
    "Stupid you see and afraid of being mixed up with the\npolice.",
    "Theyre a backward lot here.",
    "Still weve got a fair amount to get on with said Graves.",
    "Nash took the letter I had given him from the pocket and tossed it\nover to Graves.",
    "The latter glanced through it laid it with the others and observed\napprovingly Very nice very nice indeed...",
    "It was not the way I should have chosen to describe the epistle in\nquestion but experts I suppose have their own point of view.",
    "I was\nglad that that piece of paper with obscene abuse gave somebody\npleasure.",
    "Weve got enough I think to go on with said Inspector Graves\nand Ill ask all you gentlemen if you receive any more letters to\n\n\fbring them along at once.",
    "Also if you should know of someone who\nhas received them you in particular Doctor among your patients\ndo your best to get them to come to us.",
    "Ive got here for example\none to Mr. Symmington received two months ago one to Dr.\nGriffith one to Miss Ginch one written to Mrs. Mudge the butchers\nwife one to Jennifer Clark barmaid at the Three Crowns the one\nreceived by Mrs. Symmington this one now to Miss Burton and one\nto the bank manager.",
    "Quite a representative collection I remarked.",
    "And there isnt one case that is very different from the others.",
    "This\none is very similar to the one written by that girl from the hat shop.",
    "That\n\none\n\nis\n\npractically the same\n\nas the one\n\nwritten in\n\nNorthumberland by a student.",
    "Believe me gentlemen sometimes\nId like something new instead of this boring routine.",
    "There is nothing new under the Sun I observed.",
    "Nash sighed and said How true.",
    "You would know that in our\nprofession.",
    "Symmington asked\n\nHave you come to some conclusion about the author\n\nGraves cleared his throat and delivered a small lecture\n\nThere are certain similarities shared by all these letters.",
    "I shall\nenumerate them gentlemen in case they suggest any thing to your\n\n\fminds.",
    "The text of the letters is composed of words made up from\nindividual letters cut out of a printed book.",
    "Its an old book printed\nI should say about the year 1830.",
    "This has obviously been done to\navoid the risk of recognition through handwriting which is as most\npeople know nowadays a fairly easy matter... the socalled\ndisguising of a hand not amounting to much when faced with expert\ntests.",
    "There are no fingerprints on the letters and envelopes of a\ndistinctive character.",
    "That is to say they have been handled by the\npostal authorities the recipient and there are other stray\nfingerprints but no set common to all showing therefore that the\nperson who put them together was careful to wear gloves.",
    "The envelopes are typewritten by a Windsor 7 machine well worn\nwith the a and the t out of alignment.",
    "Most of them have been\nposted locally or put in the box of a house by hand.",
    "It is therefore\nevident that they are of local provenance.",
    "They were written by a\nwoman and in my opinion a woman of middle age or over and\nprobably though not certainly unmarried.",
    "We maintained a respectful silence for a minute or two.",
    "Then I said The typewriters your best bet isnt it That oughtnt to\nbe difficult in a little place like this.",
    "Inspector Graves shook his head sadly and said Thats where\nyoure wrong sir.",
    "The typewriter said Superintendent Nash is unfortunately too\neasy.",
    "It is an old one from Mr. Symmingtons office given by him to\n\n\fthe Womens Institute where I may say its fairly easy of access.",
    "The ladies here all often go into the Institute.",
    "Cant you tell something definite from the  er  the touch dont you\ncall it\n\nAgain Graves nodded.",
    "Yes that can be done  but these envelopes\nhave all been typed by someone using one finger.",
    "Someone then unused to the typewriter\n\nNo I wouldnt say that.",
    "Someone perhaps who can type but\ndoesnt want us to know the fact.",
    "Whoever writes these things has been very cunning I said slowly.",
    "She is sir she is said Graves.",
    "Up to every trick of the trade.",
    "I shouldnt have thought one of these bucolic women down here\nwould have had the brains I said.",
    "Graves coughed.",
    "I havent made myself plain Im afraid.",
    "Those\nletters were written by an educated woman.",
    "What by a lady\n\nThe word slipped out involuntarily.",
    "I hadnt used the term lady for\nyears.",
    "But now it came automatically to my lips reechoed from\ndays long ago and my grandmothers faint unconsciously arrogant\nvoice saying Of course she isnt a lady dear.",
    "Nash understood at once.",
    "The word lady still meant something to\nhim.",
    "Not necessarily a lady he said.",
    "But certainly not a village\nwoman.",
    "Theyre mostly pretty illiterate down here cant spell and\ncertainly cant express themselves with fluency.",
    "I was silent for I had had a shock.",
    "The community was so small.",
    "Unconsciously I had visualised the writer of the letters as a Mrs.\nCleat or her like some spiteful cunning halfwit.",
    "Symmington put my thoughts into words.",
    "He said sharply But that\nnarrows it down to about half a dozen to a dozen people in the\nwhole place I cant believe it.",
    "Then with a slight effort and looking straight in front of him as\nthough the mere sound of his own words was distasteful he said\n\nYou have heard what I stated at the inquest.",
    "In case you may have\nthought that that statement was actuated by a desire to protect my\nwifes memory I should like to repeat now that I am firmly\nconvinced that the subject matter of the letter my wife received was\nabsolutely false.",
    "I know it was false.",
    "My wife was a very sensitive\nwoman and  er  well you might call it prudish in some respects.",
    "Such a letter would have been a great shock to her and she was in\npoor health.",
    "Graves responded instantly\n\n\fThats quite likely to be right sir.",
    "None of these letters show any\nsigns of intimate knowledge.",
    "Theyre just blind accusations.",
    "Theres\nbeen no attempt to blackmail.",
    "And there doesnt seem to be any\nreligious bias  such as we sometimes get.",
    "Its just sex and spite\nAnd thats going to give us quite a good pointer toward the writer.",
    "Symmington got up.",
    "Dry and unemotional as the man was his lips\nwere trembling.",
    "I hope you find the devil who writes these soon.",
    "She murdered my\nwife as surely as if shed put a knife into her.",
    "He paused.",
    "How does she feel now I wonder\n\nHe went out leaving that question unanswered.",
    "How does she feel Griffith I asked.",
    "It seemed to me the answer\nwas in his province.",
    "God knows.",
    "Remorseful perhaps.",
    "On the other hand it may be\nthat shes enjoying her power.",
    "Mrs. Symmingtons death may have\nfed her mania.",
    "I hope not I said with a slight shiver.",
    "Because if so shell \n\nI hesitated and Nash finished the sentence for me Shell try it\nagain That Mr. Burton would be the best thing that could happen\nfor us.",
    "The pitcher goes to the well once too often remember.",
    "Shed be mad to go on with it I exclaimed.",
    "Shell go on said Graves.",
    "They always do.",
    "Its a vice you know\nthey cant let it alone.",
    "I shook my head with a shudder.",
    "I asked if they needed me any\nlonger I wanted to get out into the air.",
    "The atmosphere seemed\ntinged with evil.",
    "Theres nothing more Mr. Burton said Nash.",
    "Only keep your\neyes open and do as much propaganda as you can  that is to say\nurge on everyone that theyve got to report any letter they receive.",
    "I nodded.",
    "I should think everyone in the place has had one of the foul things\nby now I said.",
    "I wonder said Graves.",
    "He put his sad head a little on one side and\nasked You dont know definitely of anyone who didnt have a\nletter\n\nWhat an extraordinary question The population at large isnt likely\nto take me into their confidence.",
    "No no Mr. Burton I didnt mean that.",
    "I just wondered if you knew\nof any one person who quite definitely to your certain knowledge\nhas not received an anonymous letter.",
    "Well as a matter of fact I hesitated I do in a way.",
    "And I repeated my conversation with Emily Barton and what she\nhad said.",
    "Graves received the information with a wooden face and said\nWell that may come in useful.",
    "Ill note it down.",
    "I went out into the afternoon sunshine with Owen Griffith.",
    "Once in\nthe street I swore aloud.",
    "What kind of place is this for a man to come to to lie in the sun and\nheal his wounds Its full of festering poison this place and it looks\nas peaceful and as innocent as the Garden of Eden.",
    "Even there said Owen drily there was one serpent.",
    "Look here Griffith do they know anything Have they got any\nidea\n\nI dont know.",
    "Theyve got a wonderful technique the police.",
    "Theyre seemingly so frank and they tell you nothing.",
    "Yes.",
    "Nash is a nice fellow.",
    "And a very capable one.",
    "If anyones batty in this place you ought to know it I said\naccusingly.",
    "Griffith shook his head.",
    "He looked discouraged.",
    "But he looked more\nthan that  he looked worried.",
    "I wondered if he had an inkling of\nsome kind.",
    "We had been walking along the High Street.",
    "I stopped at the door of\nthe houseagents.",
    "I believe my second installment of rent is due  in advance.",
    "Ive got\na good mind to pay it and clear out with Joanna right away.",
    "Forfeit\nthe rest of the tenancy.",
    "Dont go said Owen.",
    "Why not\n\nHe didnt answer.",
    "He said slowly after a minute or two\n\nAfter all  I dare say youre right.",
    "Lymstock isnt healthy just now.",
    "It\nmight  it might harm you or  or your sister.",
    "Nothing harms Joanna I said.",
    "Shes tough.",
    "Im the weakly one.",
    "Somehow this business makes me sick.",
    "It makes me sick said Owen.",
    "I pushed the door of the house agents place half open.",
    "But I shant go I said.",
    "Vulgar curiosity is stronger than\npulsilanimity.",
    "I want to know the solution.",
    "I went in.",
    "A woman who was typing got up and came toward me.",
    "She had\nfrizzy hair and simpered but I found her more intelligent than the\nspectacled youth who had previously held sway in the outer office.",
    "A minute or two later something familiar about her penetrated\nthrough\n\nto\n\nmy\n\nconsciousness.",
    "It\n\nwas\n\nMiss\n\nGinch\n\nlately\n\nSymmingtons lady clerk.",
    "I commented on the fact.",
    "You used to be with Galbraith Galbraith and Symmington werent\nyou I said.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "But I thought it was better to leave.",
    "This is quite\na good post though not quite so well paid.",
    "But there are things that\nare more valuable than money dont you think so\n\nUndoubtedly.",
    "Those awful letters breathed Miss Ginch in a sibilant whisper.",
    "I\ngot a dreadful one.",
    "About me and Mr. Symmington  oh terrible it\nwas saying the most awful things I knew my duty and I took it to\nthe police though of course it wasnt exactly pleasant for me was\nit\n\nNo no most unpleasant.",
    "But they thanked me and said I had done quite right.",
    "But I felt that\nafter that if people were talking  and evidently they must have\nbeen or where did the writer get the idea from  then I must avoid\neven the appearance of evil though there has never been anything\nat all wrong between me and Mr. Symmington.",
    "I felt rather embarrassed.",
    "No no of course not.",
    "But people have such evil minds.",
    "Yes alas such evil minds\n\nNervously trying to avoid it I nevertheless met her eye and I made\na most unpleasant discovery.",
    "Miss Ginch was thoroughly enjoying herself.",
    "Already once today I had come across someone who reacted\npleasurably to anonymous letters.",
    "Inspector Graves enthusiasm\nwas\n\nprofessional.",
    "Miss\n\nGinchs\n\nenjoyment\n\nI\n\nfound\n\nmerely\n\nsuggestive and disgusting.",
    "An idea flashed across my startled mind.",
    "Had Miss Ginch written these letters herself\n\nWhen I got home I found Mrs. Dane Calthrop sitting talking to\nJoanna.",
    "She looked I thought gray and ill.",
    "This has been a terrible shock to me Mr. Burton she said.",
    "Poor\nthing poor thing.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "Its awful to think of someone being driven to the\nstage of taking their own life.",
    "Oh you mean Mrs. Symmington\n\nDidnt you\n\nMrs. Dane Calthrop shook her head.",
    "Of course one is sorry for her\nbut it would have been bound to happen anyway wouldnt it\n\nWould it said Joanna drily.",
    "Mrs. Dane Calthrop turned to her.",
    "Oh I think so dear.",
    "If suicide is your idea of escape from trouble\nthen it doesnt very much matter what the trouble is.",
    "Whenever\nsome very unpleasant shock had to be faced shed have done the\nsame thing.",
    "What it really comes down to is that she was that kind\nof woman.",
    "Not that one would have guessed it.",
    "She always seemed\nto me a selfish rather stupid woman with a good firm hold on life.",
    "Not the kind to panic you would think  but Im beginning to realize\nhow little I really know about anyone.",
    "Im still curious as to whom you meant when you said Poor thing\nI remarked.",
    "She stared at me.",
    "The woman who wrote the letters of course.",
    "I dont think I said drily I shall waste sympathy on her.",
    "Mrs. Dane Calthrop leaned forward.",
    "She laid a hand on my knee.",
    "But dont you realise cant you feel Use your imagination.",
    "Think\nhow desperately violently unhappy anyone must be to sit down and\nwrite these things.",
    "How lonely how cut off from humankind.",
    "Poisoned through and through with a dark stream of poison that\nfinds its outlet in this way.",
    "Thats why I feel so selfreproachful.",
    "Somebody in this town has been racked with that terrible\nunhappiness and Ive had no idea of it.",
    "I should have had.",
    "You cant\ninterfere with actions  I never do.",
    "But that black inward\nunhappiness  like a septic arm physically all black and swollen.",
    "If\nyou could cut it and let the poison out it would flow away\nharmlessly.",
    "Yes poor soul poor soul.",
    "She got up to go.",
    "I did not feel like agreeing with her.",
    "I had no sympathy for our\nanonymous letter writer whatsoever.",
    "But I did ask curiously\n\nHave you any idea at all Mrs. Calthrop who this woman is\n\nShe turned her fine perplexed eyes on me.",
    "Well I can guess she\nsaid.",
    "But then I might be wrong mightnt I\n\n\fShe went swiftly out through the door popping her head back to\nask Do tell me why have you never married Mr. Burton\n\nIn anyone else it would have been impertinence but with Mrs. Dane\nCalthrop you felt that the idea had suddenly come into her head and\nshe had really wanted to know.",
    "Shall we say I said rallying that I have never met the right\nwoman\n\nWe can say so said Mrs. Dane Calthrop but it wouldnt be a very\ngood answer because so many men have obviously married the\nwrong woman.",
    "This time she really departed.",
    "Joanna said You know I really do think shes mad.",
    "But I like her.",
    "The people in the village here are afraid of her.",
    "So am I a little.",
    "Because you never know whats coming next\n\nYes.",
    "And theres a careless brilliancy about her guesses.",
    "Joanna said slowly Do you really think whoever wrote these\nletters is very unhappy\n\nI dont know what the damned hag is thinking or feeling And I\ndont care.",
    "Its her victims Im sorry for.",
    "It seems odd to me now that in our speculations about Poison Pens\nframe of mind we missed the most obvious one.",
    "Griffith had\npictured her as possibly exultant.",
    "I had envisaged her as\nremorseful  appalled by the result of her handiwork.",
    "Mrs. Dane\nCalthrop had seen her as suffering.",
    "Yet the obvious the inevitable reaction we did not consider  or\nperhaps I should say I did not consider.",
    "That reaction was Fear.",
    "For with the death of Mrs. Symmington the letters had passed out\nof one category into another.",
    "I dont know what the legal position\nwas  Symmington knew I suppose but it was clear that with a\ndeath resulting the position of the writer of the letters was much\nmore serious.",
    "There could now be no question of passing it off as a\njoke if the identity of the writer was discovered.",
    "The police were\nactive a Scotland Yard expert was called in.",
    "It was vital now for the\nanonymous author to remain anonymous.",
    "And granted that Fear was the principal reaction other things\nfollowed.",
    "Those possibilities also I was blind to.",
    "Yet surely they\nshould have been obvious.",
    "Joanna and I came down rather late to breakfast the next morning.",
    "That is to say late by the standards of Lymstock.",
    "It was ninethirty\nan hour at which in London Joanna was just unclosing an eyelid\nand mine would probably be still tight shut.",
    "However when Partridge had said Breakfast at half past eight or\nnine oclock neither Joanna nor I had had the nerve to suggest a\nlater hour.",
    "To my annoyance Aim\u0439e Griffith was standing on the doorstep\ntalking to Megan.",
    "She gave tongue with her usual heartiness at the sight of us\n\nHullo there slackers Ive been up for hours.",
    "That of course was her own business.",
    "A doctor no doubt has to\nhave early breakfast and a dutiful sister is there to pour out his tea\nor coffee.",
    "But it is no excuse for coming and butting in on ones\nmore somnolent neighbours.",
    "Ninethirty is not the time for a\nmorning call.",
    "Megan slipped back into the house and into the dining room where\nI gathered she had been interrupted in her breakfast.",
    "I said I wouldnt come in said Aim\u0439e Griffith  though why it is\nmore of a merit to force people to come and speak to you on the\ndoorstep than to talk to them inside the house I do not know.",
    "Just\nwanted to ask Miss Burton if shed any vegetables to spare for our\nRed Cross stall on the main road.",
    "If so Id get Owen to call for them\nin the car.",
    "Youre out and about very early I said.",
    "The early bird catches the worm said Aim\u0439e.",
    "You have a better\nchance of finding people in this time of day.",
    "Im off to Mr. Pyes next.",
    "Got to go over to Brenton this afternoon.",
    "Guides.",
    "Your energy makes me quite tired I said and at that moment the\ntelephone rang and I retired to the back of the hall to answer it\nleaving Joanna murmuring rather doubtfully something about\nrhubarb and French beans and exposing her ignorance of the\nvegetable garden.",
    "Yes I said into the telephone mouthpiece.",
    "A confused noise of deep breathing came from the other end of the\nwire and a doubtful female voice said Oh\n\nYes I said again encouragingly.",
    "Oh said the voice again and then it inquired adenoidally Is thatwhat I mean  is that Little Furze\n\nThis is Little Furze.",
    "Oh This clearly a stock beginning to every sentence.",
    "The voice inquired cautiously Could I speak to Miss Partridge just\na minute\n\nCertainly I said.",
    "Who shall I say is calling\n\nOh.",
    "Tell her its Agnes would you Agnes Waddle.",
    "Agnes Waddle\n\nThats right.",
    "Resisting the temptation to say Donald Duck to you I put down\nthe telephone receiver and called up the stairs to where I could\nhear the sound of Partridges activities overhead.",
    "Partridge Partridge\n\nPartridge appeared at the head of the stairs a long mop in one\nhand and a look of What is it now clearly discernible behind her\ninvariably respectful manner.",
    "Yes sir\n\nAgnes Waddle wants to speak to you on the telephone.",
    "I beg your pardon sir\n\nI raised my voice Agnes Waddle.",
    "I have spelled the name as it presented itself to my mind.",
    "But I will\nnow spell it as it was actually written\n\nAgnes Woddell  whatever can she want now\n\n\fVery much put out of countenance Partridge relinquished her mop\nand rustled down the stairs her print dress crackling with\nagitation.",
    "I beat an unobtrusive retreat into the dining room where Megan was\nwolfing down kidneys and bacon.",
    "Megan unlike Aim\u0439e Griffith was\ndisplaying no glorious morning face.",
    "In fact she replied very\ngruffly to my morning salutations and continued to eat in silence.",
    "I opened the morning paper and a minute or two later Joanna\nentered looking somewhat shattered.",
    "Whew she said.",
    "Im so tired.",
    "And I think Ive exposed my utter\nignorance of what grows when.",
    "Arent there runner beans this time\nof year\n\nAugust said Megan.",
    "Well one has them any time in London said Joanna defensively.",
    "Tins sweet fool I said.",
    "And cold storage on ships from the farflung limits of Empire.",
    "Like ivory apes and peacocks asked Joanna.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Id rather have peacocks said Joanna thoughtfully.",
    "Id like a monkey of my own as a pet said Megan.",
    "Meditatively peeling an orange Joanna said I wonder what it\nwould feel like to be Aim\u0439e Griffith all bursting with health and\nvigour and enjoyment of life.",
    "Do you think shes ever tired or\ndepressed or  or wistful\n\nI said I was quite certain Aim\u0439e Griffith was never wistful and\nfollowed Megan out of the open French window onto the veranda.",
    "Standing there filling my pipe I heard Partridge enter the dining\nroom from the hall and heard her voice say grimly\n\nCan I speak to you a minute Miss\n\nDear me I thought.",
    "I hope Partridge isnt going to give notice.",
    "Emily Barton would be very annoyed with us if so.",
    "Partridge went on I must apologise Miss for being rung up on the\ntelephone.",
    "That is to say the young person who did so should have\nknown better.",
    "I have never been in the habit of using the telephone\nor of permitting my friends to ring me up on it and Im very sorry\nindeed that it should have occurred and the master taking the call\nand everything.",
    "Why thats quite all right Partridge said Joanna soothingly why\nshouldnt your friends use the phone if they want to speak to you\n\nPartridges face I could feel though I could not see it was more\ndour than ever as she replied coldly\n\n\fIt is not the kind of thing that has ever been done in this house.",
    "Miss Emily would never permit it.",
    "As I say I am sorry it occurred\nbut Agnes Woddell the girl who did it was upset and shes young\ntoo and doesnt know whats fitting in a gentlemans house.",
    "Thats one for you Joanna I thought gleefully.",
    "This Agnes who rung me up Miss went on Partridge she used\nto be in service here under me.",
    "Sixteen she was then and come\nstraight from the orphanage.",
    "And you see not having a home or a\nmother or any relations to advise her shes been in the habit of\ncoming to me.",
    "I can tell her whats what you see.",
    "Yes said Joanna and waited.",
    "Clearly there was more to follow.",
    "So I am taking the liberty of asking you Miss if you would allow\nAgnes to come here to tea this afternoon in the kitchen.",
    "Its her day\nout you see and shes got something on her mind she wants to\nconsult me about.",
    "I wouldnt dream of suggesting such a thing in\nthe usual way.",
    "Joanna said bewildered But why shouldnt you have anyone to tea\nwith you\n\nPartridge drew herself up at this so Joanna said afterward and\nreally looked most formidable as she replied\n\nIt has never been the custom of this house Miss.",
    "Old Mrs. Barton\nnever allowed visitors in the kitchen excepting as it should be our\nown day out in which case we were allowed to entertain friends\n\n\fhere instead of going out but otherwise on ordinary days no.",
    "And\nMiss Emily keeps to the old ways.",
    "Joanna is very nice to servants and most of them like her but she\nhas never cut any ice with Partridge.",
    "Its no good my girl I said when Partridge had gone and Joanna\nhad joined me outside.",
    "Your sympathy and leniency are not\nappreciated.",
    "The good old overbearing ways for Partridge and\nthings done the way they should be done in a gentlemans house.",
    "I never heard of such tyranny as not allowing them to have their\nfriends to see them said Joanna.",
    "Its all very well Jerry but they\ncant like being treated like black slaves.",
    "Evidently they do I said.",
    "At least the Partridges of this world\ndo.",
    "I cant imagine why she doesnt like me.",
    "Most people do.",
    "She probably despises you as an inadequate housekeeper.",
    "You\nnever draw your hand across a shelf and examine it for traces of\ndust.",
    "You dont look under the mats.",
    "You dont ask what happened\nto the remains of the chocolate souffle and you never order a nice\nbread pudding.",
    "Ugh said Joanna.",
    "She went on sadly Im a failure all around\ntoday.",
    "Despised by our Aim\u0439e for ignorance of the vegetable\nkingdom.",
    "Snubbed by Partridge for being a human being.",
    "I shall\nnow go out into the garden and eat worms.",
    "Megans there already I said.",
    "For Megan had wandered away a few minutes previously and was\nnow standing aimlessly in the middle of a patch of lawn looking not\nunlike a meditative bird waiting for nourishment.",
    "She came back however toward us and said abruptly I say I\nmust go home today.",
    "What I was dismayed.",
    "She went on flushing but speaking with nervous determination\n\nIts been awfully good of you having me and I expect Ive been a\nfearful nuisance but I have enjoyed it awfully only now I must go\nback because after all well its my home and one cant stay away\nforever so I think Ill go this morning.",
    "Both Joanna and I tried to make her change her mind but she was\nquite adamant and finally Joanna got out the car and Megan went\nupstairs and came down a few minutes later with her belongings\npacked up again.",
    "The only person pleased seemed to be Partridge who had almost a\nsmile on her grim face.",
    "She had never liked Megan much.",
    "I was standing in the middle of the lawn when Joanna returned.",
    "She\nasked me if I thought I was a sundial.",
    "Why\n\nStanding there like a garden ornament.",
    "Only one couldnt put on\nyou the motto of only marking the sunny hours.",
    "You looked like\nthunder\n\nIm out of humour.",
    "First Aim\u0439e Griffith   Gracious murmured\nJoanna in parentheses I must speak about those vegetables and then Megan beetling off.",
    "Id thought of taking her for a walk up\nto Legge Tor.",
    "With a collar and lead I suppose said Joanna.",
    "What\n\nJoanna repeated loudly and clearly as she moved off around the\ncorner of the house to the kitchen garden\n\nI said With a collar and lead I suppose Masters lost his dog\nthats whats the matter with you\n\nChapter 4\n\nI was annoyed I must confess at the abrupt way in which Megan\nhad left us.",
    "Perhaps she had suddenly got bored with us.",
    "After all it wasnt a very amusing life for a girl.",
    "At home she had the\nkids and Elsie Holland.",
    "I heard Joanna returning and hastily moved in case she should\nmake more rude remarks about sundials.",
    "Owen Griffith called in his car just before lunchtime and the\ngardener was waiting for him with the necessary garden produce.",
    "While Old Adams was stowing it in the car I brought Owen indoors\nfor a drink.",
    "He wouldnt stay to lunch.",
    "When I came in with the sherry I found Joanna had begun doing her\nstuff.",
    "No signs of animosity now.",
    "She was curled up in the corner of\nthe sofa and was positively purring asking Owen questions about\nhis work if he liked being a G.P.",
    "if he wouldnt rather have\nspecialized She thought doctoring is one of the most fascinating\nthings in the world.",
    "Say what you will of her Joanna is a creature capable of listening\nattentively to anyone.",
    "After hearing the outpourings of so many\nyoung misunderstood geniuses telling her how they had been\nunapreciated all their lives Owen Griffith was easy money.",
    "By the\ntime we got to the third glass of sherry Griffith was telling her\nabout an obscure reaction or leson in such scientific terms nobody\ncould have understood a word of it except a medico.",
    "Joanna was looking intelligent and deeply interested.",
    "I felt a moments qualm.",
    "It was really to bad.",
    "Griffith was too good a\nchap to be played fast with.",
    "Women really were devils.",
    "Then I caught a sideways view of Griffith his powerful chin and the\nthin set of his lips and I doubted that Joanna was going to have it\nher own way.",
    "Anyway a man has no business to let himself be led\nby a woman.",
    "Its his own lookout if he does.",
    "Then Joanna said\n\nDo change your mind and stay to lunch Dr. Griffith and Griffith\nflushed a little and said that only his sister would be expecting him\nback...\n\nWell ring her up and explain said Joanna quickly went out into\nthe hall and did so.",
    "I thought Griffith looked a little uneasy and it crossed mind that he\nwas probably a little afraid of his sister.",
    "Joanna came back smiling and said that that was all.",
    "And Owen Griffith stayed to lunch and seemed to enjoy himself.",
    "We\ntalked about books and plays and world politics and about music\nand painting and modern architecture.",
    "We didnt talk about Lymstock at all or about anonymous letters or\nMrs. Symmingtons suicide.",
    "We got right away from everything and I think Owen Griffith was\nhappy.",
    "His dark sad face lighted up and he revealed an interesting\nmind.",
    "When he had gone I said to Joanna That fellows too good for your\ntricks.",
    "Thats what you say Joanna said.",
    "You men all stick together\n\nWhy are you out after his hide Joanna Wounded vanity\n\nPerhaps said my sister.",
    "That afternoon we were to go to tea with Miss Emily Barton at her\nrooms in the village.",
    "We strolled down there on foot for I felt strong enough now to\nmanage the hill back again.",
    "We must actually have allowed too much time and got there early\nfor the door was opened to us by a tall rawboned fiercelooking\nwoman who told us that Miss Barton wasnt in yet.",
    "But shes expecting you I know so if youll come up and wait\nplease.",
    "This was evidently faithful Florence.",
    "We followed her up the stairs and she threw open a door and\nshowed us into what was quite a comfortable sitting room though\nperhaps a little overfurnished.",
    "Some of the things I suspected had\ncome from Little Furze.",
    "The woman was clearly proud of her room.",
    "Its nice isnt it she demanded.",
    "Very nice said Joanna warmly.",
    "I make her as comfortable as I can.",
    "Not that I can do for her as Id\nlike to and in the way she ought to have.",
    "She ought to be in her own\nhouse properly not turned out into rooms.",
    "Florence who was clearly a dragon looked from one to the other of\nus reproachfully.",
    "It was not I felt our lucky day.",
    "Joanna had been\nticked off by Aim\u0439e Griffith and Partridge and now we were both\nbeing ticked off by the dragon Florence.",
    "Parlourmaid I was for nine years there she added.",
    "Joanna goaded by injustice said Well Miss Barton wanted to let\nthe house.",
    "She put it down at the house agents.",
    "Forced to it said Florence.",
    "And she living so frugal and careful.",
    "But even then the government cant leave her alone Has to have\nits pound of flesh just the same.",
    "I shook my head sadly.",
    "Plenty of money there was in the old ladys time said Florence.",
    "And then they all died off one after another poor dears.",
    "Miss Emily\nnursing of them one after the other.",
    "Wore herself out she did and\nalways so patient and uncomplaining.",
    "But it told on her and then to\n\n\fhave worry about money on top of it all Shares not bringing in what\nthey used to so she says and why not I should like to know They\nought to be ashamed of themselves.",
    "Doing down a lady like her\nwhos got no head for figures and cant be up to their tricks.",
    "Practically everyone has been hit that way I said but Florence\nremained unsoftened.",
    "Its all right for some as can look after themselves but not for her.",
    "She needs looking after and as long as shes with me Im going to\nsee no one imposes on her or upsets her in any way.",
    "Id do anything\nfor Miss Emily.",
    "And glaring at us for some moments in order to drive that point\nthoroughly home the indomitable Florence left the room carefully\nshutting the door behind her.",
    "Do you feel like a bloodsucker Jerry inquired Joanna.",
    "Because I do.",
    "Whats the matter with us\n\nWe dont seem to be going down very well I said.",
    "Megan gets\ntired of us Partridge disapproves of you faithful Florence\ndisapproves of both of us.",
    "Joanna murmured I wonder why Megan did leave\n\nShe got bored.",
    "I dont think she did at all.",
    "I wonder  do you think Jerry it could\nhave been something that Aim\u0439e Griffith said\n\nYou mean this morning when they were talking on the doorstep\n\nYes.",
    "There wasnt much time of course but \n\nI finished the sentence But that womans got the tread of a cow\nelephant She might have \n\nThe door opened and Miss Emily came in.",
    "She was pink and a little\nout of breath and seemed excited.",
    "Her eyes were very blue and\nshining.",
    "She chirruped at us in quite a distracted manner\n\nOh dear Im so sorry Im late.",
    "Just doing a little shopping in the\ntown and the cakes at the Blue Rose didnt seem to me quite fresh\nso I went on to Mrs. Lygons.",
    "I always like to get my cakes the last\nthing then one gets the newest batch just out of the oven and one\nisnt put off with the day befores.",
    "But I am so distressed to have\nkept you waiting  really unpardonable \n\nJoanna cut in\n\nIts our fault Miss Barton.",
    "Were early.",
    "We walked down and Jerry\nstrides along so fast now that we arrive everywhere too soon.",
    "Never too soon dear.",
    "Dont say that.",
    "One cannot have too much of\na good thing you know.",
    "And the old lady petted Joanna affectionately on the shoulder.",
    "Joanna brightened up.",
    "At last so it seemed she was being a\nsuccess.",
    "Emily Barton extended her smile to include me but with a\nslight timidity in it rather as one might approach a maneating tiger\nguaranteed for the moment harmless.",
    "Its very good of you to come to such a feminine meal as tea Mr.\nBurton.",
    "Emily Barton I think has a mental picture of men as interminably\nconsuming whiskyandsodas and smoking cigars and in the\nintervals dropping out to do a few seductions of village maidens or\nto conduct a liaison with a married woman.",
    "When I said this to Joanna later she replied that it was probably\nwishful thinking that Emily Barton would have liked to come across\nsuch a man but alas had never done so.",
    "In the meantime Miss Emily was fussing around the room\narranging Joanna and myself with little tables and carefully\nproviding ashtrays and a minute later the door opened and\nFlorence came in bearing a tray of tea with some fine Crown Derby\ncups on it which I gathered Miss Emily had brought with her.",
    "The\ntea was China and delicious and there were plates of sandwiches\nand thin bread and butter and a quantity of little cakes.",
    "Florence was beaming now and looked at Miss Emily with a kind of\nmaternal pleasure as at a favorite child enjoying a dolls tea party.",
    "Joanna and I ate far more than we wanted to our hostess pressed\nus so earnestly.",
    "The little lady was clearly enjoying her tea party\nand I perceived that to Emily Barton Joanna and I were a big\nadventure two people from the mysterious world of London and\nsophistication.",
    "Naturally our talk soon dropped into local channels.",
    "Miss Barton\nspoke warmly of Dr. Griffith his kindness and his cleverness as a\ndoctor.",
    "Mr. Symmington too was a very clever lawyer and had\nhelped Miss Barton to get some money back from the Income Tax\nwhich she would never have known about.",
    "He was so nice to his\nchildren too devoted to them and to his wife she caught herself up.",
    "Poor Mrs. Symmington its so dreadfully sad with those young\nchildren left motherless.",
    "Never perhaps a very strong woman and her health had been bad of late.",
    "A brainstorm that is what it must have been.",
    "I read about such a\nthing in the paper.",
    "People really do not know what they are doing\nunder those circumstances.",
    "And she cant have known what she\nwas doing or else she would have remembered Mr. Symmington\nand the children.",
    "That anonymous letter must have shaken her up very badly said\nJoanna.",
    "Miss Barton flushed.",
    "She said with a tinge of reproof in her voice\n\nNot a very nice thing to discuss do you think dear I know there\nhave been  er  letters but we wont talk about them.",
    "Nasty things.",
    "I\nthink they are better just ignored.",
    "Well Miss Barton might be able to ignore them but for some people\nit wasnt so easy.",
    "However I obediently changed the subject and we\ndiscussed Aim\u0439e Griffith.",
    "Wonderful quite wonderful said Emily Barton.",
    "Her energy and\nher organizing powers are really splendid.",
    "Shes so good with girls\ntoo.",
    "And shes so practical and up to date in every way.",
    "She really\nruns this place.",
    "And absolutely devoted to her brother.",
    "Its very nice\nto see such devotion between brother and sister.",
    "Doesnt he ever find her a little overwhelming asked Joanna.",
    "Emily Barton stared at her in a startled fashion.",
    "She has sacrificed a great deal for his sake she said with a touch\nof reproachful dignity.",
    "I saw a touch of Oh Yeah in Joannas eye and hastened to divert\nthe conversation to Mr. Pye.",
    "Emily Barton was a little dubious about Mr. Pye.",
    "All she could say was repeated rather doubtfully that he was very\nkind  yes very kind.",
    "Very well off too and most generous.",
    "He had\nvery strange visitors sometimes but then of course he had\ntraveled a lot.",
    "We agreed that travel not only broadened the mind but\noccasionally resulted in the forming of strange acquaintances.",
    "I have often wished myself to go on a cruise said Emily Barton\nwistfully.",
    "One reads about them in the papers and they sound so\nattractive.",
    "Why dont you go asked Joanna.",
    "This turning of a dream into a reality seemed to alarm Miss Emily.",
    "Oh no no that would be quite impossible.",
    "But why Theyre fairly cheap.",
    "Oh its not only the expense.",
    "But I shouldnt like to go alone.",
    "Traveling alone would look very peculiar dont you think\n\nNo said Joanna.",
    "Miss Emily looked at her doubtfully.",
    "And I dont know how I would manage about my luggage  and\ngoing ashore at foreign ports  and all the different currencies \n\nInnumerable pitfalls seemed to rise up before the little ladys\naffrighted gaze and Joanna hastened to calm her by a question\nabout an approaching garden f\u043ate and sale of work.",
    "This led us\nquite naturally to Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "A faint spasm showed for a minute on Miss Bartons face.",
    "You know dear she said she is really a very odd woman.",
    "The\nthings she says sometimes.",
    "I asked what things.",
    "Oh I dont know.",
    "Such very unexpected things.",
    "And the way she\nlooks at you as though you werent there but somebody else was Im expressing it badly but it is so hard to convey the impression I\nmean.",
    "And then she wont  well interfere at all.",
    "There are so many\ncases where a vicars wife could advise  perhaps admonish.",
    "Pull\npeople up you know and make them mend their ways.",
    "Because\npeople would listen to her Im sure of that theyre all quite in awe\nof her.",
    "But she insists on being aloof and far away and has such a\ncurious habit of feeling sorry for the most unworthy people.",
    "Thats interesting I said exchanging a quick glance with Joanna.",
    "Still she is a very wellbred woman.",
    "She was a Miss Farroway of\nBellpath very good family but these old families sometimes are a\nlittle peculiar I believe.",
    "But she is devoted to her husband who is a\nman of very fine intellect  wasted I am sometimes afraid in this\ncountry circle.",
    "A good man and most sincere but I always find his\nhabit of quoting Latin a little confusing.",
    "Hear hear I said fervently.",
    "Jerry had an expensive public school education so he doesnt\nrecognize Latin when he hears it said Joanna.",
    "This led Miss Barton to a new topic.",
    "The schoolmistress here is a most unpleasant young woman she\nsaid.",
    "Quite Red Im afraid.",
    "She lowered her voice over the word\nRed.",
    "Later as we walked home up the hill Joanna said to me.",
    "Shes\nrather sweet.",
    "At dinner that night Joanna said to Partridge that she hoped her tea\nparty had been a success.",
    "Partridge got rather red in the face and held herself even more\nstiffly.",
    "Thank you Miss but Agnes never turned up after all.",
    "Oh Im sorry.",
    "It didnt matter to me said Partridge.",
    "She was so swelling with grievance that she condescended to pour\nit out to us\n\nIt wasnt me who thought of asking her She rang up herself said\nshed something on her mind and could she come here it being her\nday off.",
    "And I said yes subject to your permission which I\nobtained.",
    "And after that not a sound or sign of her And no word of\napology either though I should hope Ill get a postcard tomorrow\n\n\fmorning.",
    "These girls nowadays  dont know their place  no idea of\nhow to behave.",
    "Joanna attempted to soothe Partridges wounded feelings\n\nShe mightnt have felt well.",
    "You didnt ring up to find out\n\nPartridge drew herself up again.",
    "No I did not Miss No indeed.",
    "If Agnes likes to behave rudely\nthats her lookout but I shall give her a piece of my mind when we\nmeet.",
    "Partridge went out of the room still stiff with indignation and\nJoanna and I laughed.",
    "Probably a case of Advice from Aunt Nancys Column I said.",
    "My boy is very cold in his manner to me what shall I do about it\nFailing Aunt Nancy Partridge was to be applied to for advice but\ninstead there has been a reconciliation and I expect at this minute\nthat Agnes and her boy are one of those speechless couples locked\nin each others arms that you come upon suddenly standing by a\ndark hedge.",
    "They embarrass you horribly but you dont embarrass\nthem.",
    "Joanna laughed and said she expected that was it.",
    "We began talking of the anonymous letters and wondered how\nNash and the melancholy Graves were getting on.",
    "Its a week today exactly said Joanna since Mrs. Symmingtons\nsuicide.",
    "I should think they must have got on to something by now.",
    "Fingerprints or handwriting or something.",
    "I answered her absently.",
    "Somewhere behind my conscious mind a\nqueer uneasiness was growing.",
    "It was connected in some way with\nthe phrase that Joanna had used a week exactly.",
    "I ought I dare say to have put two and two together earlier.",
    "Perhaps unconsciously my mind was already suspicious.",
    "Anyway\nthe leaven was working now.",
    "The uneasiness was growing  coming\nto a head.",
    "Joanna noticed suddenly that I wasnt listening to her spirited\naccount of a village encounter.",
    "Whats the matter Jerry\n\nI did not answer because my mind was busy piecing things\ntogether.",
    "Mrs. Symmingtons suicide... She was alone in the house that\nafternoon Alone in the house because the maids were having their\nday out.",
    "A week ago exactly...\n\nJerry what \n\nI interrupted\n\nJoanna maids have days out once a week dont they\n\n\fAnd alternate Sundays said Joanna.",
    "What on \n\nNever mind Sundays.",
    "They go out the same day every week\n\nYes.",
    "Thats the usual thing.",
    "Joanna was staring at me curiously.",
    "Her mind had not taken the\ntrack mine had.",
    "I crossed the room and rang the bell.",
    "Partridge came.",
    "Tell me I said this Agnes Woddell.",
    "Shes in service\n\nYes sir.",
    "At Mrs. Symmingtons.",
    "At Mr. Symmingtons I should say\nnow.",
    "I drew a deep breath.",
    "I glanced at the clock.",
    "It was half past ten.",
    "Would she be back now do you think\n\nPartridge was looking disapproving.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "The maids have to be\nin by ten there.",
    "Theyre oldfashioned.",
    "I said Im going to ring up.",
    "I went out to the hall.",
    "Joanna and Partridge followed me.",
    "Partridge\nwas clearly furious.",
    "Joanna was puzzled.",
    "She said as I was trying to\nget the number What are you going to do Jerry\n\nId like to be sure that the girl has come in all right.",
    "Partridge sniffed.",
    "Just sniffed nothing more.",
    "But I did not care\ntwopence about Partridges sniffs.",
    "Elsie Holland answered the telephone from the other end.",
    "Sorry to ring you up I said.",
    "This is Jerry Burton speaking.",
    "Is has  your maid Agnes come in\n\nIt was not until after I had said it that I suddenly felt a bit of a fool.",
    "For if the girl had come in and it was all right how on earth was I\ngoing to explain my ringing up and asking.",
    "I would have been better\nif I had let Joanna ask the question though even that would need a\nbit of explaining.",
    "I foresaw a new trail of gossip started in Lymstock\nwith myself and the unknown Agnes Woddell as its center.",
    "Elsie Holland sounded not unnaturally very much surprised\n\nAgnes Oh shes sure to be in by now.",
    "I felt a fool but I went on with it\n\nDo you mind just seeing if she has turned in Miss Holland\n\n\fThere is one thing to be said for a nursery governess she is used to\ndo when told.",
    "Hers not to reason why Elsie Holland put down the\nreceiver and went off obediently.",
    "Two minutes later I heard her voice Are you there Mr. Burton\n\nYes.",
    "Agnes isnt in yet as a matter of fact.",
    "I knew then that my hunch had been right.",
    "I heard a sound of voices vaguely from the other end then\n\nSymmington himself spoke\n\nHullo Burton whats the matter\n\nYour maid Agnes isnt back yet.",
    "No.",
    "Mrs. Holland has just been to see.",
    "Whats the matter Theres\nnot been an accident has there\n\nNot an accident properly.",
    "Do you have reason to believe something has happened\n\nI said grimly\n\nI shouldnt be surprised.",
    "I slept badly that night.",
    "I think that even then there were pieces of the puzzle floating about\nin my mind.",
    "I believe that if I had given my mind to it I would have\nsolved the whole thing then and there.",
    "Otherwise why did those\nfragments tag along so persistently\n\nHow much do we know at any time Much more or so I believe\nthan we know we know But we cannot break through to that\nsubterranean knowledge.",
    "Its there but we cannot reach it.",
    "I lay on my bed tossing uneasily and only vague bits of the puzzle\ncame to torture me.",
    "There was a pattern if only I could get hold of it.",
    "I ought to know\nwho wrote those damned letters.",
    "There was a trail somewhere if\nonly I could follow it...\n\nAs I dropped off to sleep words danced irritatingly through my\ndrowsy mind\n\nNo smoke without fire.",
    "No fire without smoke.",
    "Smoke...",
    "Smoke\nSmoke screen... No that was the war  a war phrase.",
    "War.",
    "Scrap of\npaper... Only a scrap of paper.",
    "Belgium  Germany...",
    "I fell asleep.",
    "I dreamed that I was taking Mrs. Dane Calthrop who\nhad turned into a greyhound for a walk with a collar and lead.",
    "It was the ringing of the telephone that roused me.",
    "A persistent\nringing.",
    "I sat up in bed glanced at my watch.",
    "It was half past seven.",
    "I had\nnot yet been called.",
    "The telephone was ringing in the hall\ndownstairs.",
    "I jumped out of bed pulled on a dressing gown and raced down.",
    "I\nbeat Partridge coming through the back door from the kitchen by a\nshort head.",
    "I picked up the receiver.",
    "Hullo\n\nOh  It was a sob of relief.",
    "Its you Megans voice.",
    "Megans voice\nindescribably forlorn and frightened.",
    "Oh please do come  do\ncome.",
    "Oh please do Will you\n\nIm coming at once I said.",
    "Do you hear At once.",
    "I took the stairs two at a time and burst in on Joanna.",
    "Look here Jo Im going off to the Symmingtons.",
    "Joanna lifted a curly blond head from the pillow and rubbed her\neyes like a small child.",
    "Why  whats happened\n\nI dont know.",
    "It was the child  Megan.",
    "She sounded all in.",
    "What do you think it is\n\nThe girl Agnes unless Im very much mistaken.",
    "As I went out of the door Joanna called after me Wait.",
    "Ill get up\nand drive you down.",
    "No need.",
    "Ill drive myself.",
    "You cant drive the car.",
    "Yes I can.",
    "I did too.",
    "It hurt but not too much.",
    "Id washed shaved dressed\ngot the car out and driven to the Symmingtons in half an hour.",
    "Not\nbad going.",
    "Megan must have been watching for me.",
    "She came out of the house\nat a run and clutched me.",
    "Her poor little face was white and\ntwitching.",
    "Oh youve come  youve come\n\nHold up funnyface I said.",
    "Yes Ive come.",
    "Now what is it\n\nShe began to shake.",
    "I put my arm around her.",
    "I  I found her.",
    "You found Agnes Where\n\n\fThe trembling grew.",
    "Under the stairs.",
    "Theres a cupboard there.",
    "It has fishing rods and\ngolf clubs and things.",
    "You know.",
    "I nodded.",
    "It was the usual cupboard.",
    "Megan went on\n\nShe was there  all huddled up  and  and cold  horribly cold.",
    "She\nwas  she was dead you know\n\nI asked curiously What made you look there\n\nI  I dont know.",
    "You telephoned last night.",
    "And we all began\nwondering where Agnes was.",
    "We waited up some time but she\ndidnt come in and at last we went to bed.",
    "I didnt sleep very well\nand I got up early.",
    "There was only Rose the cook you know about.",
    "She was very cross about Agnes not having come back.",
    "She said\nshed been before somewhere when a girl did a flit like that.",
    "I had\nsome milk and bread and butter in the kitchen  and then suddenly\nRose came in looking queer and she said that Agnes outdoor\nthings were still in her room.",
    "Her best ones that she goes out in.",
    "And I began to wonder if  if shed ever left the house and I started\nlooking around and I opened the cupboard under the stairs and and she was there...\n\nSomebodys rung up the police I suppose\n\n\fYes theyre here now.",
    "My stepfather rang them up straightaway.",
    "And then I  I felt I couldnt bear it and I rang you up.",
    "You dont\nmind\n\nNo said.",
    "I dont mind.",
    "I looked at her curiously.",
    "Did anybody give you some brandy or some coffee or some tea\nafter  after you found her\n\nMegan shook her head.",
    "I cursed the whole Symmington m\u0439nage.",
    "That stuffed shirt\nSymmington thought of nothing but the police.",
    "Neither Elsie\nHolland nor the cook seemed to have thought of the effect on the\nsensitive child who had made that gruesome discovery.",
    "Come on slabface I said.",
    "Well go to the kitchen.",
    "We went around the house to the back door and into the kitchen.",
    "Rose a plump puddingfaced woman of forty was drinking strong\ntea by the kitchen fire.",
    "She greeted us with a flow of talk and her\nhand to her heart.",
    "Shed come all over queer she told me awful the palpitations were\nJust think of it it might have been her it might have been any of\nthem murdered in their beds they might have been.",
    "Dish out a good strong cup of that tea for Miss Megan I said.",
    "Shes had a shock you know.",
    "Remember it was she who found the\nbody.",
    "The mere mention of a body nearly sent Rose off again but I quelled\nher with a stern eye and she poured out a cup of inky fluid.",
    "There you are young woman I said to Megan.",
    "you drink that\ndown.",
    "You havent got any brandy I suppose Rose\n\nRose said rather doubtfully that there was a drop of cooking brandy\nleft over from the Christmas puddings.",
    "Thatll do I said and put a dollop of it into Megans cap.",
    "I saw by Roses eye that she thought it a good idea.",
    "I told Megan to stay with Rose.",
    "I can trust you to look after Miss Megan I said and Rose replied\nin a gratified way Oh yes sir.",
    "I went through into the house.",
    "If I knew Rose and her kind she\nwould soon find it necessary to keep her strength up with a little\nfood and that would be good for Megan too.",
    "Confound these\npeople why couldnt they look after the child\n\nFuming inwardly I ran into Elsie Holland in the hall.",
    "She didnt seem\nsurprised to see me.",
    "I suppose that the gruesome excitement of the\n\n\fdiscovery made one oblivious of who was coming and going.",
    "The\nconstable Bert Rundle was by the front door.",
    "Elsie Holland gasped out Oh Mr. Burton isnt it awful Whoever\ncan have done such a dreadful thing\n\nIt was murder then\n\nOh yes.",
    "She was struck on the back of the head.",
    "Its all blood and\nhair  oh its awful  and bundled into that cupboard.",
    "Who can have\ndone such a wicked thing And why Poor Agnes Im sure she\nnever did anyone any harm.",
    "No I said.",
    "Somebody saw to that pretty promptly.",
    "She stared at me.",
    "Not I thought a quickwitted girl.",
    "But she had\ngood nerves.",
    "Her color was as usual slightly heightened by\nexcitement and I even fancied that in a macabre kind of way and in\nspite of a naturally kind heart she was enjoying the drama.",
    "She said apologetically I must go up to the boys.",
    "Mr. Symmington\nis so anxious that they shouldnt get a shock.",
    "He wants me to keep\nthem right away.",
    "Megan found the body I hear I said.",
    "I hope somebody is looking\nafter her.",
    "I will say for Elsie Holland that she looked consciencestricken.",
    "Oh dear she said.",
    "I forgot all about her.",
    "I do hope shes all right.",
    "Ive been so rushed you know and the police and everything  but it\nwas remiss of me.",
    "Poor girl she must be feeling bad.",
    "Ill go and look\nfor her at once.",
    "I relented.",
    "Shes all right I said.",
    "Rose is looking after her.",
    "You get along to\nthe kids.",
    "She thanked me with a flash of white tombstone teeth and hurried\nupstairs.",
    "After all the boys were her job and not Megan Megan\nwas nobodys job.",
    "Elsie was paid to look after Symmingtons\nblinking brats.",
    "One could hardly blame her for attending to it.",
    "As she flashed around the corner of the stairs I caught my breath.",
    "For a minute I caught a glimpse of a Winged Victory deathless and\nincredibly beautiful instead of a conscientious nursery governess.",
    "Then a door opened and Superintendent Nash stepped out into the\nhall with Symmington behind him.",
    "Oh Mr. Burton he said I was just going to telephone you.",
    "Im\nglad you are here.",
    "He didnt ask me  then  why I was here.",
    "He turned his head and said to Symmington Ill use this room if I\nmay.",
    "It was a small morning room with a window on the front of the\nhouse.",
    "Certainly certainly.",
    "Symmingtons poise was pretty good but he looked desperately\ntired.",
    "Superintendent Nash said gently\n\nI should have some breakfast if I were you Mr. Symmington.",
    "You\nand Miss Holland and Miss Megan will feel much better after coffee\nand eggs and bacon.",
    "Murder is a nasty business on an empty\nstomach.",
    "He spoke in a comfortable familydoctor kind of way.",
    "Symmington gave a faint attempt at a smile and said Thank you\nSuperintendent Ill take your advice.",
    "I followed Nash into the little morning room and he shut the door.",
    "He said then Youve got here very quickly How did you hear\n\nI told him that Megan had rung me up.",
    "I felt welldisposed toward\nSuperintendent Nash.",
    "He at any rate had not forgotten that\nMegan too would be in need of breakfast.",
    "I hear that you telephoned last night Mr. Burton asking about this\ngirl Why was that\n\n\fI suppose it did seem odd.",
    "I told him about Agnes telephone call to\nPartridge and her nonappearance.",
    "He said Yes I see.",
    "He said it slowly and reflectively rubbing his chin.",
    "Then he sighed.",
    "Well he said.",
    "Its murder now right enough.",
    "Direct physical\naction.",
    "The question is what did the girl know Did she say\nanything to this Partridge Anything definite\n\nI dont think so.",
    "But you can ask her.",
    "Yes I shall come up and see her when Ive finished here.",
    "What happened exactly I asked.",
    "Or dont you know yet\n\nNear enough.",
    "It was the maids day out \n\nBoth of them\n\nYes it seems that there used to be two sisters here who liked to go\nout together so Mrs. Symmington arranged it that way.",
    "Then when\nthese two came she kept to the same arrangement.",
    "They used to\nhave cold supper laid out in the diningroom and Miss Holland used\nto get tea.",
    "I see.",
    "Its pretty clear up to a point.",
    "The cook Rose comes from Nether\nMickford and in order to get there on her day out she has to catch\nthe halfpasttwo bus.",
    "So Agnes has to finish clearing up lunch\nalways Rose used to wash up the supper things in the evenings to\neven things up.",
    "Thats what happened yesterday Rose went off to catch the bus at\ntwotwentyfive Symmington left for his office at twentyfive to\nthree.",
    "Elsie Holland and the children went out at a quarter to three.",
    "Megan Hunter went out on her bicycle about five minutes later.",
    "Agnes would then be alone in the house.",
    "As far as I can make out\nshe normally left the house between three oclock and half past\nthree.",
    "The house being then left empty\n\nOh they dont worry about that down here.",
    "Theres not much\nlocking up done in these parts.",
    "As I say at ten minutes to three\nAgnes was alone in the house.",
    "That she never left it is clear for she\nwas in her cap and apron still when we found her body.",
    "I suppose you can tell roughly the time of death\n\nDoctor Griffith wont commit himself.",
    "Between two oclock and\nfourthirty is his official medical verdict.",
    "How was she killed\n\n\fShe was first stunned by a blow on the back of the head.",
    "Afterward\nan ordinary kitchen skewer sharpened to a fine point was thrust\ninto the base of the skull causing instantaneous death.",
    "I lit a cigarette.",
    "It was not a nice picture.",
    "Pretty coldblooded I said.",
    "Oh yes yes that was indicated.",
    "I inhaled deeply.",
    "Who did it I said.",
    "And why\n\nI dont suppose said Nash slowly that we shall ever know\nexactly why.",
    "But we can guess.",
    "She knew something\n\nShe knew something.",
    "She didnt give anyone here a hint\n\nAs far as I can make out no.",
    "Shes been upset so the cook says\never since Mrs. Symmingtons death and according to this Rose\nshes been getting more and more worried and kept saying she\ndidnt know what she ought to do.",
    "He gave a short exasperated sigh.",
    "Its always the way.",
    "They wont come to us.",
    "Theyve got that deepseated prejudice against being mixed up with the police.",
    "If shed\ncome along and told us what was worrying her shed be alive\ntoday.",
    "Didnt she give the other women any hint\n\nNo or so Rose says and Im inclined to believe her.",
    "For if she had\nRose would have blurted it out at once with a good many fancy\nembellishments of her own.",
    "Its maddening I said not to know.",
    "We can still guess Mr. Burton.",
    "To begin with it cant be anything\nvery definite.",
    "Its got to be the sort of thing that you think over and\nas you think it over your uneasiness grows.",
    "You see what I mean\n\nYes.",
    "Actually I think I know what it was.",
    "I looked at him with respect.",
    "Thats good work Superintendent.",
    "Well you see Mr. Burton I know something that you dont.",
    "On the\nafternoon that Mrs. Symmington committed suicide both maids\nwere supposed to be out.",
    "It was their day out.",
    "But actually Agnes\ncame back to the house.",
    "You know that\n\nYes.",
    "Agnes has a boyfriend  young Rendell from the fish shop.",
    "Wednesday is early closing and he comes along to meet Agnes and\nthey go for a walk or to the pictures if its wet.",
    "That Wednesday\nthey had a row practically as soon as they met.",
    "Our letter writer\nhad been active suggesting that Agnes had other fish to fry and\nyoung Fred Rendell was all worked up.",
    "They quarreled violently and\nAgnes bolted back home and said she wasnt coming out unless\nFred said he was sorry.",
    "Well\n\nWell Mr. Burton the kitchen faces the back of the house but the\npantry looks out where we are looking now.",
    "Theres only one\nentrance gate.",
    "You come through it and either up to the front door\nor else along the path at the side of the house to the back door.",
    "He paused.",
    "Now Ill tell you something That letter that came to Mrs.\nSymmington that afternoon didnt come by post.",
    "It had a used\nstamp affixed to it and the postmark faked quite convincingly in\nlamp black so that it would seem to have been delivered by the\npostman with the afternoon letters.",
    "But actually it had not been\nthrough the post.",
    "You see what that means\n\nIt means I said slowly that it was left by hand pushed through\nthe letter box some time before the afternoon post was delivered\nso that it should be among the other letters.",
    "Exactly.",
    "The afternoon post comes around about a quarter to four.",
    "My theory is this The girl was in the pantry looking through the\nwindow its masked by shrubs but you can see through them quite\nwell watching out for her young man to turn up and apologise.",
    "I said And she saw whoever it was delivered that note\n\nThats my guess Mr. Burton.",
    "I may be wrong of course.",
    "I dont think you are... Its simple and convincing  and it means\nthat Agnes knew who the anonymous letter writer was.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nYes.",
    "Nash said.",
    "Agnes knew who wrote those letters.",
    "But then why didnt she  I paused frowning.",
    "Nash said quickly As I see it the girl didnt realize what she had\nseen.",
    "Not at first.",
    "Somebody had left a letter at the house yes  but\nthat somebody was nobody she would dream of connecting with the\nanonymous letters.",
    "It was somebody from that point of view quite\nabove suspicion.",
    "But the more she thought about it the more uneasy she grew.",
    "Ought she perhaps to tell someone about it In her perplexity she\nthinks of Miss Bartons Partridge who I gather is a somewhat\n\n\fdominant personality and whose judgement Agnes would accept\nunhesitatingly.",
    "She decides to ask Partridge what she ought to do.",
    "Yes I said thoughtfully.",
    "It fits well enough.",
    "And somehow or\nother\n\nPoison\n\nPen\n\nfound\n\nout.",
    "How\n\ndid\n\nshe\n\nfind\n\nout\n\nSuperintendent\n\nYoure not used to living in the country Mr. Burton.",
    "Its a kind of\nmiracle how things get around.",
    "First of all theres the telephone\ncall.",
    "Who overheard it on your end\n\nI reflected.",
    "I took the call originally.",
    "I called up to Partridge.",
    "Mentioning the girls name\n\nYes  yes I did.",
    "Did anyone overhear you\n\nMy sister or Miss Griffith might have done so.",
    "Ah Miss Griffith.",
    "What was she doing up there\n\nI explained.",
    "Was she going back to the village\n\nShe was going to Mr. Pye first.",
    "Superintendent Nash sighed.",
    "Thats two ways it could have gone\nall over the place.",
    "I was incredulous.",
    "Do you mean that either Miss Griffith or Mr. Pye\nwould bother to repeat a meaningless little bit of information like\nthat\n\nAnythings news in a place like this.",
    "Youd be surprised.",
    "If the\ndressmakers mother has got a bad corn everybody hears about it\nAnd then there is this end.",
    "Miss Holland Rose  they could have\nheard what Agnes said.",
    "And theres Fred Rendell.",
    "It may have got\naround through him that Agnes went back to the house that\nafternoon.",
    "I gave a slight shiver.",
    "I was looking out of the window.",
    "In front of me\nwas a neat square of grass and a path and the low prim gate.",
    "Someone had opened the gate had walked very correctly and\nquietly up to the house and had pushed a letter through the letter\nbox.",
    "I saw hazily in my minds eye that vague womans shape.",
    "The\nface was blank  but it must be a face that I knew...",
    "Superintendent Nash was saying\n\nAll the same this narrows things down.",
    "Thats always the way we\nget em in the end.",
    "Steady patient elimination.",
    "There arent so very\nmany people it could be now.",
    "You mean \n\n\fIt knocks out any women clerks who were at their work all the\nafternoon.",
    "It knocks out the schoolmistress.",
    "She was teaching.",
    "And\nthe district nurse.",
    "I know where she was yesterday.",
    "Not that I ever\nthought it was any of them but now were sure.",
    "You see Mr.\nBurton weve got two definite times now on which to concentrate yesterday afternoon and the week before.",
    "On the day of Mrs.\nSymmingtons death from say a quarter past three the earliest\npossible time at which Agnes could have been back in the house\nafter her quarrel and four oclock when the post must have come\nbut I can get that fixed more accurately with the postman.",
    "And\nyesterday from ten minutes to three when Miss Megan Hunter left\nthe house until half past three or more probably a quarter past\nthree as Agnes hadnt begun to change.",
    "What do you think happened yesterday\n\nNash made a grimace.",
    "What do I think I think a certain lady walked up to the front door\nand rang the bell quite calm and smiling the afternoon caller...\nMaybe she asked for Miss Holland or for Miss Megan or perhaps\nshe had brought a parcel.",
    "Anyway Agnes turns around to get a\nsalver for cards or to take the parcel in and our ladylike caller bats\nher on the back of her unsuspecting head.",
    "What with\n\nNash said The ladies around here usually carry large sizes in\nhandbags.",
    "No saying what mightnt be inside it.",
    "And then stabs her through the back of the neck and bundles her\ninto the cupboard Wouldnt that be a hefty job for a woman\n\nSuperintendent Nash looked at me with rather a queer expression.",
    "The woman were after isnt normal  not by a long way  and that\ntype of mental instability goes with surprising strength.",
    "Agnes\nwasnt a big girl He paused and then asked What made Miss\nMegan Hunter think of looking in that cupboard\n\nSheer instinct I said.",
    "Then I asked Why drag her out of the way What was the point\n\nThe longer it was before the body was found the more difficult it\nwould be to fix the time of death accurately.",
    "If Miss Holland for\ninstance fell over the body as soon as she came in a doctor might\nbe able to fix it within ten minutes or so  which might be awkward\nfor our lady friend.",
    "I said frowning But if Agnes was suspicious of this person \n\nNash interrupted me She wasnt.",
    "Not to this pitch.",
    "She just\nthought it queer shall we say She was a slowwitted girl I\nimagine and she was only vaguely suspicious with a feeling that\nsomething was wrong.",
    "She certainly didnt suspect that she was up\nagainst a woman who would do murder.",
    "Did you suspect that I asked.",
    "Nash shook his head.",
    "He said with feeling\n\nI ought to have known.",
    "That suicide business you see frightened\nPoison Pen.",
    "She got the wind up.",
    "Fear Mr. Burton is an\nincalculable thing.",
    "Yes fear.",
    "That was the thing we ought to have foreseen.",
    "Fear  in a\nlunatic brain...\n\nYou see said Superintendent Nash and somehow his words\nmade the whole thing seem absolutely horrible.",
    "Were up against\nsomeone whos respected and thought highly of  someone in fact\nof good social position\n\nPresently Nash said that he was going to interview Rose once\nmore.",
    "I asked him rather diffidently if I might come too.",
    "Rather to\nmy surprise he assented cordially.",
    "Im very glad of your cooperation Mr. Burton if I may say so.",
    "That sounds suspicious I said.",
    "In books when a detective\nwelcomes someones assistance that someone is usually the\nmurderer.",
    "Nash laughed shortly.",
    "He said Youre hardly the type to write\nanonymous letters Mr. Burton.",
    "He added Frankly you can be\nuseful to us.",
    "Im glad but I dont see how.",
    "Youre a stranger down here thats why.",
    "Youve got no\npreconceived ideas about the people here.",
    "But at the same time\nyouve got the opportunity of getting to know things in what I may\ncall a social way.",
    "The murderer is a person of good social position I murmured.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Im to be the spy within the gates\n\nHave you any objection\n\nI thought it over.",
    "No I said frankly I havent.",
    "If theres a\ndangerous lunatic about driving inoffensive women to suicide and\nhitting miserable little maidservants on the head then Im not\naverse to doing a bit of dirty work to put that lunatic under\nrestraint.",
    "Thats sensible of you sir.",
    "And let me tell you the person were\nafter is dangerous.",
    "Shes about as dangerous as a rattlesnake and\na cobra and a black mamba rolled into one.",
    "I gave a slight shiver.",
    "I said In fact weve got to make haste\n\nThats right.",
    "Dont think were inactive in the force.",
    "Were not.",
    "Were working on several different lines.",
    "He said it grimly.",
    "I had a vision of a fine farflung spiders web...\n\nNash wanted to hear Roses story again so he explained to me\nbecause she had already told him two different versions and the\nmore versions he got from her the more likely it was that a few\ngrains of truth might be incorporated.",
    "We found Rose washing up breakfast and she stopped at once and\nrolled her eyes and clutched her heart and explained again how\nshed been coming over queer all the morning.",
    "Nash was patient with her but firm.",
    "Hed been soothing the first\ntime so he told me and peremptory the second and he now\nemployed a mixture of the two.",
    "Rose enlarged pleasurably on the details of the past week of how\nAgnes had gone about in deadly fear and had shivered and said\nDont ask me when Rose had urged her to say what was the\nmatter.",
    "It would be death if she told me thats what she said\nfinished Rose rolling her eyes happily.",
    "Had Agnes given no hint of what was troubling her No except\nthat she went in fear of her life.",
    "Superintendent Nash sighed and\nabandoned the theme contenting himself with extracting an exact\naccount of Roses own activities the preceding afternoon.",
    "This put baldly was that Rose had caught the 230 bus and had\nspent the afternoon and evening with her family returning by the\n840 bus from Nether Mickford.",
    "The recital was complicated by the\nextraordinary presentiments of evil that Rose had had all the\n\n\fafternoon and how her sister had commented on it and how she\nhadnt been able to touch a morsel of seed cake.",
    "From the kitchen we went in search of Elsie Holland who was\nsuperintending the childrens lessons.",
    "As always Elsie Holland was competent and obliging.",
    "She rose and\nsaid Now Colin you and Brian will do these three sums and have\nthe answers ready for me when I come back.",
    "She then led us into\nthe night nursery.",
    "Will this do I thought it would be better not to talk before the\nchildren.",
    "Thank you Miss Holland.",
    "Just tell me once more are you quite\nsure that Agnes never mentioned to you being worried over\nanything  since Mrs. Symmingtons death I mean\n\nNo she never said anything.",
    "She was a very quiet girl you know\nand didnt talk much.",
    "A change from the other one then\n\nYes Rose talks much too much.",
    "I have to tell her not to be\nimpertinent sometimes.",
    "Now will you tell me exactly what happened yesterday afternoon\nEverything you can remember.",
    "Well we had lunch as usual.",
    "One oclock and we hurried just a\nlittle.",
    "I dont let the boys dawdle.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Mr. Symmington went\nback to the office and I helped Agnes by laying the table for supper\n the boys ran out in the garden till I was ready to take them.",
    "Where did you go\n\nToward Combe Acre by the field path  the boys wanted to fish.",
    "I\nforgot their bait and had to go back for it.",
    "What time was that\n\nLet me see we started about twenty to three  or just after.",
    "Megan\nwas coming but changed her mind.",
    "She was going out on her\nbicycle.",
    "Shes got quite a craze for bicycling.",
    "I mean what time was it when you went back for the bait Did you\ngo into the house\n\nNo.",
    "Id left it in the conservatory at the back.",
    "I dont know what\ntime it was then  about ten minutes to three perhaps.",
    "Did you see Megan or Agnes\n\nMegan must have started I think.",
    "No I didnt see Agnes.",
    "I didnt\nsee anyone.",
    "And after that you went fishing\n\n\fYes we went along by the stream.",
    "We didnt catch anything.",
    "We\nhardly ever do but the boys enjoy it.",
    "Brian got rather wet.",
    "I had to\nchange his things when we got in.",
    "You attend to tea on Wednesdays\n\nYes.",
    "Its all ready in the drawing room for Mr. Symmington.",
    "I just\nmake the tea when he comes in.",
    "The children and I have ours in the\nschoolroom  and Megan of course.",
    "I have my own tea things and\neverything in the cupboard up there.",
    "What time did you get in\n\nAt ten minutes to five.",
    "I took the boys up and started to lay tea.",
    "Then when Mr. Symmington came in at five I went down to make his\nbut he said he would have it with us in the schoolroom.",
    "The boys\nwere so pleased.",
    "We played Animal Grab afterward.",
    "It seems so\nawful to think of now  with that poor girl in the cupboard all the\ntime.",
    "Would anybody go to that cupboard normally\n\nOh no its only used for keeping junk.",
    "The hats and coats hang in\nthe little cloakroom to the right of the front door as you come in.",
    "No\none might have gone to the other cupboard for months.",
    "I see.",
    "And you noticed nothing unusual nothing abnormal at all\nwhen you came back\n\n\fThe blue eyes opened very wide.",
    "Oh no Inspector nothing at all.",
    "Everything was just the same as usual.",
    "Thats what was so awful\nabout it.",
    "And the week before\n\nYou mean the day Mrs. Symmington \n\nYes.",
    "Oh that was terrible  terrible\n\nYes yes I know.",
    "You were out all that afternoon also\n\nOh yes I always take the boys out in the afternoon  if its fine\nenough.",
    "We do lessons in the morning.",
    "We went up on the moor I\nremember  quite a long way.",
    "I was afraid I was late back because\nas I turned in at the gate I saw Mr. Symmington coming from his\noffice at the other end of the road and I hadnt even put the kettle\non but it was just ten minutes to five.",
    "You didnt go up to Mrs. Symmington\n\nOh no.",
    "I never did.",
    "She always rested after lunch.",
    "She had attacks\nof neuralgia  and they used to come on after meals.",
    "Dr. Griffith had\ngiven her some powders to take.",
    "She used to lie down and try to\nsleep.",
    "Nash said in a casual voice So no one would take her up the\npost\n\n\fThe afternoon post No Id look in the letter box and put the letters\non the hall table when I came in.",
    "But very often Mrs. Symmington\nused to come down and get it herself.",
    "She didnt sleep all the\nafternoon.",
    "She was usually up again by four.",
    "You didnt think anything was wrong because she wasnt up that\nafternoon\n\nOh no I never dreamed of such a thing.",
    "Mr. Symmington was\nhanging up his coat in the hall and I said Teas not quite ready but\nthe kettles nearly boiling and he nodded and called out Mona\nMona  and then as Mrs. Symmington didnt answer he went\nupstairs to her bedroom and it must have been the most terrible\nshock to him.",
    "He called me and I came and he said Keep the\nchildren away and then he phoned Dr. Griffith and we forgot all\nabout the kettle and it burned the bottom out Oh dear it was\ndreadful and shed been so happy and cheerful at lunch.",
    "Nash said abruptly What is your own opinion of that letter she\nreceived Miss Holland\n\nElsie Holland said indignantly Oh I think it was wicked  wicked\n\nYes yes I dont mean that.",
    "Did you think it was true Elsie\nHolland said firmly\n\nNo indeed I dont.",
    "Mrs. Symmington was very sensitive  very\nsensitive indeed.",
    "She had to take all sorts of things for her nerves.",
    "And she was very  well particular.",
    "Elsie flushed.",
    "Anything of that\nsort  nasty I mean  would have given her a great shock.",
    "Nash was silent for a moment then he asked Have you had any of\nthese letters Miss Holland\n\nNo.",
    "No I havent had any.",
    "Are you sure Please  he lifted a hand  dont answer in a hurry.",
    "Theyre not pleasant things to get I know.",
    "And sometimes people\ndont like to admit theyve had them.",
    "But its very important in this\ncase that we should know.",
    "Were quite aware that the statements in\nthem are just a tissue of lies so you neednt feel embarrassed.",
    "But I havent Superintendent.",
    "Really I havent.",
    "Not anything of the\nkind.",
    "She was indignant almost tearful and her denials seemed genuine\nenough.",
    "When she went back to the children Nash stood looking out of the\nwindow.",
    "Well he said thats that She says she hasnt received any of\nthese letters.",
    "And she sounds as though shes speaking the truth.",
    "She did certainly.",
    "Im sure she was.",
    "Hm said Nash.",
    "Then what I want to know is why the devil hasnt\nshe\n\n\fHe went on rather impatiently as I stared at him\n\nShes a pretty girl isnt she\n\nRather more than pretty.",
    "Exactly.",
    "As a matter of fact shes uncommonly goodlooking.",
    "And\nshes young.",
    "In fact shes just the meat an anonymous letter writer\nwould like.",
    "Then why has she been left out I shook my head.",
    "Its interesting you know.",
    "I must mention it to Graves.",
    "He asked if\nwe could tell him definitely of anyone who hadnt had one.",
    "Shes the second person I said.",
    "Theres Emily Barton\nremember.",
    "Nash gave a faint chuckle.",
    "You shouldnt believe everything youre\ntold Mr. Burton.",
    "Miss Barton had one all right  more than one.",
    "How do you know\n\nThat devoted dragon shes lodging with told me  her late\nparlourmaid or cook.",
    "Florence Elford.",
    "Very indignant she was about\nit.",
    "Would like to have the writers blood.",
    "Why did Miss Emily say she hadnt had any\n\nDelicacy.",
    "Their language isnt nice.",
    "Little Miss Barton has spent\nher life avoiding the coarse and unrefined.",
    "What did the letter say\n\nThe usual.",
    "Quite ludicrous in her case.",
    "And incidentally insinuated\nthat she poisoned off her old mother and most of her sisters\n\nI said incredulously Do you mean to say theres really this\ndangerous lunatic going about and we cant spot her right away\n\nWell spot her said Nash and his voice was grim.",
    "Shell write\njust one letter too many.",
    "But my goodness man she wont go on writing these things  not\nnow.",
    "He looked at me.",
    "Oh yes she will.",
    "You see she cant stop now.",
    "Its a morbid\ncraving.",
    "The letters will go on make no mistake about that.",
    "I went and found Megan before leaving the house.",
    "She was in the\ngarden and seemed almost back to her usual self.",
    "She greeted me\nquite cheerfully.",
    "I suggested that she should come back to us again for a while but\nafter a momentary hesitation she shook her head.",
    "Its nice of you  but I think Ill stay here.",
    "After all it is  well I\nsuppose its my home.",
    "And I dare say I can help with the boys a bit.",
    "Well I said its as you like.",
    "Then I think Ill stay.",
    "I could  I could \n\nYes I prompted.",
    "If  if anything awful happened I could ring you up couldnt I and\nyoud come.",
    "I was touched.",
    "Of course.",
    "But what awful thing do you think might\nhappen\n\nOh I dont know.",
    "She looked vague.",
    "Things seem rather like that\njust now dont they\n\nStop it I said.",
    "And dont go nosing out any more bodies Its not\ngood for you.",
    "She gave me a brief flash of a smile.",
    "No it isnt.",
    "It made me feel\nawfully sick.",
    "I didnt much like leaving her there but after all as she had said it\nwas her home.",
    "And I fancied now that Elsie Holland would feel more\nresponsible for her.",
    "Nash and I went up together to Little Furze.",
    "While I gave Joanna an\naccount of the mornings doings Nash tackled Partridge.",
    "He\nrejoined us looking discouraged.",
    "Not much help there.",
    "According to this woman the girl only said\nshe was worried about something and didnt know what to do and\nthat shed like Miss Partridges advice.",
    "Did Partridge mention the fact to anyone asked Joanna.",
    "Nash\nnodded looking grim.",
    "Yes she told Mrs. Emory  your daily woman  on the lines as far\nas I can gather that there were some young women who were\nwilling to take advice from their elders and didnt think they could\nsettle everything for themselves offhand Agnes mightnt be very\nbright but she was a nice respectful girl and knew her manners.",
    "Partridge preening herself in fact murmured Joanna.",
    "And Mrs. Emory could have passed it around the town\n\nThats right Miss Burton.",
    "Theres one thing rather surprises me I said.",
    "Why were my\nsister and I included We were strangers down here  nobody could\nhave had a grudge against us.",
    "Youre failing to allow for the mentality of a Poison Pen  all is grist\nthat comes to their mill.",
    "Their grudge you might say is against\nhumanity.",
    "I suppose said Joanna thoughtfully that that is what Mrs. Dane\nCalthrop meant.",
    "Nash looked at her inquiringly but she did not enlighten him.",
    "The superintendent said\n\nI dont know if you happened to look closely at the envelope of the\nletter you got Miss Burton.",
    "If so you may have noticed that it was\nactually addressed to Miss Barton and the a altered to a u\nafterward.",
    "That remark properly interpreted ought to have given us a clue to\nthe whole business.",
    "As it was none of us saw any significance in it.",
    "Nash went off and I was left with Joanna.",
    "She actually said You\ndont think that letter can really have been meant for Miss Emily do\nyou\n\nIt would hardly have begun You painted trollop I pointed out\nand Joanna agreed.",
    "Then she suggested that I should go down to the town.",
    "You ought to hear what everyone is saying.",
    "It will be the topic this\nmorning\n\nI suggested that she should come too but rather to my surprise\nJoanna refused.",
    "She said she was going to mess about in the\ngarden.",
    "I paused in the doorway and said lowering my voice I suppose\nPartridge is all right.",
    "Partridge\n\nThe amazement in Joannas voice made me feel ashamed of my\nidea.",
    "I said apologetically I just wondered.",
    "Shes rather queer in some\nways  a grim spinster  the sort of person who might have religious\nmania.",
    "This isnt religious mania  or so you told me Graves said.",
    "Well sex mania.",
    "Theyre very closely tied up together I\nunderstand.",
    "Shes repressed and respectable and has been shut\nup here with a lot of elderly women for years.",
    "What put the idea into your head\n\nWell I said slowly weve only her word for it havent we as to\nwhat the girl Agnes said to her Suppose Agnes asked Partridge to\ntell her why Partridge came and left a note that day  and Partridge\nsaid shed call around that afternoon and explain.",
    "And then camouflaged it by coming to us and asking if the girl\ncould come here\n\nYes.",
    "But she never went out that afternoon.",
    "You dont know that.",
    "We were out ourselves remember.",
    "Yes thats true.",
    "Its possible I suppose.",
    "Joanna turned it over in\nher mind.",
    "But I dont think so all the same.",
    "I dont think Partridge\nhas the mentality to cover her tracks over the letters.",
    "To wipe off\nfingerprints and all that.",
    "It isnt only cunning you want  its\nknowledge.",
    "I dont think shes got that.",
    "I suppose  Joanna\nhesitated then said slowly they are sure it is a woman arent\nthey\n\nYou dont think its a man I exclaimed incredulously.",
    "Not  not an ordinary man  but a certain kind of man.",
    "Im thinking\nreally of Mr. Pye.",
    "So Pye is your selection\n\nDont you feel yourself that hes a possibility Hes the sort of\nperson who might be lonely  and unhappy  and spiteful.",
    "Everyone\nyou see rather laughs at him.",
    "Cant you see him secretly hating all\nthe normal happy people and taking a queer perverse artistic\npleasure in what he was doing\n\nGraves said a middleaged spinster.",
    "Mr. Pye said Joanna is a middleaged spinster.",
    "A misfit I said slowly.",
    "Very much so.",
    "Hes rich but money doesnt help.",
    "And I do feel he\nmight be unbalanced.",
    "He is really rather a frightening little man.",
    "He got a letter himself remember.",
    "We dont know that Joanna pointed out.",
    "We only thought so.",
    "And anyway he might have been putting on an act.",
    "For our benefit\n\nYes.",
    "Hes clever enough to think of that  and not to overdo it.",
    "He must be a firstclass actor.",
    "But of course Jerry whoever is doing this must be a firstclass\nactor.",
    "Thats partly where the pleasure comes in.",
    "For heavens sake Joanna dont speak so understandingly You\nmake me feel that you  that you understand the mentality.",
    "I think I do.",
    "I can  just  get into the mood.",
    "If I wasnt Joanna\nBurton if I wasnt young and reasonably attractive and able to have\na good time if I was  how shall I put it  behind bars watching\nother people enjoy life would a black evil tide rise in me making\nme want to hurt to torture  even to destroy\n\nJoanna I took her by the shoulders and shook her.",
    "She gave a\nlittle sigh and shiver and smiled at me.",
    "I frightened you didnt I Jerry But I have a feeling that thats the\nright way to solve this problem.",
    "Youve got to be the person\nknowing how they feel and what makes them act and then  and\nthen perhaps youll know what theyre going to do next.",
    "Oh gee I said.",
    "And I came down here to be a vegetable and get\ninterested in all the dear little local scandals.",
    "Dear little local\nscandals Libel vilification obscene language and murder\n\nJoanna was quite right.",
    "The High Street was full of interesting\ngroups.",
    "I was determined to get everyones reactions in turn.",
    "I met Griffith first.",
    "He looked terribly ill and tired.",
    "So much so that I\nwondered.",
    "Murder is not certainly all in the days work to a doctor\nbut his profession does equip him to face most things including\nsuffering the ugly side of human nature and the fact of death.",
    "You look all in I said.",
    "Do I He was vague.",
    "Oh Ive had some worrying cases lately.",
    "Including our lunatic at large\n\nThat certainly.",
    "He looked away from me across the street.",
    "I saw\na fine nerve twitching in his eyelid.",
    "Youve no suspicions as to  who\n\nNo.",
    "No.",
    "I wish I had.",
    "He asked abruptly after Joanna and said hesitatingly that he had\nsome photographs shed wanted to see.",
    "I offered to take them to her.",
    "Oh it doesnt matter.",
    "I shall be passing that way actually later in\nthe morning.",
    "I began to be afraid that Griffith had got it badly.",
    "Curse Joanna\nGriffith was too good a man to be dangled as a scalp.",
    "I let him go\nfor I saw his sister coming and I wanted for once to talk to her.",
    "Aim\u0439e Griffith began as it were in the middle of conversation.",
    "Absolutely shocking she boomed.",
    "I hear you were there  quite\nearly\n\nThere was a question in the words and her eyes glinted as she\nstressed the word early.",
    "I wasnt going to tell her that Megan had\nrung me up.",
    "I said instead You see I was a bit uneasy last night.",
    "The girl was due to tea at our house and didnt turn up.",
    "And so you feared the worst Very smart of you\n\nYes I said.",
    "Im quite the human bloodhound.",
    "Its the first murder weve ever had in Lymstock.",
    "Excitement is\nterrific.",
    "Hope the police can handle it all right.",
    "I shouldnt worry I said.",
    "Theyre an efficient body of men.",
    "Cant even remember what the girl looked like although I suppose\nshes opened the door to me dozens of times.",
    "Quiet insignificant\nlittle thing.",
    "Knocked on the head and then stabbed through the\nback of the neck so Owen tells me.",
    "Looks like a boyfriend to me.",
    "What do you think\n\nThats your solution\n\nSeems the most likely one.",
    "Had a quarrel I expect.",
    "Theyre very\ninbred around here  bad heredity a lot of them.",
    "She paused and\nthen went on I hear Megan Hunter found the body Must have\ngiven her a bit of a shock.",
    "I said shortly It did.",
    "Not too good for her I should imagine.",
    "In my opinion shes not too\nstrong in the head  and a thing like this might send her completely\noff her onion.",
    "I took a sudden resolution.",
    "I had to know something.",
    "Tell me Miss Griffith was it you who persuaded Megan to return\nhome yesterday\n\nWell I wouldnt say exactly persuaded.",
    "I stuck to my guns.",
    "But you did say something to her\n\n\fAim\u0439e Griffith planted her feet firmly and stared me in the eyes.",
    "She\nwas just slightly on the defensive.",
    "She said\n\nIts no good  that young woman shirking her responsibility.",
    "Shes\nyoung and she doesnt know how tongues wag so I felt it my duty to\ngive her a hint.",
    "Tongues  I broke off because I was too angry to go on.",
    "Aim\u0439e\nGriffith continued with that maddeningly complacent confidence in\nherself which was her chief characteristic Oh I dare say you dont\nhear all the gossip that goes around.",
    "I do I know what people are\nsaying.",
    "Mind you I dont for a minute think theres anything in it  not\nfor a minute But you know what people are  if they can say\nsomething illnatured they do And its rather hard lines on the girl\nwhen shes got her living to earn.",
    "Her living to earn I said puzzled.",
    "Aim\u0439e went on\n\nIts a difficult position for her naturally.",
    "And I think she did the\nright thing.",
    "I mean she couldnt go off at a moments notice and\nleave the children with no one to look after them.",
    "Shes been\nsplendid  absolutely splendid.",
    "I say so to everybody But there it is\nits an invidious position and people will talk.",
    "Who are you talking about I asked.",
    "Elsie Holland of course said Aim\u0439e Griffith impatiently.",
    "In my\nopinion shes a thoroughly nice girl and has only been doing her\nduty.",
    "And what are people saying\n\nAim\u0439e Griffith laughed.",
    "It was I thought rather an unpleasant\nlaugh.",
    "Theyre saying that shes already considering the possibility of\nbecoming Mrs. Symmington No.",
    "2  that shes all out to console the\nwidower and make herself indispensable.",
    "But I said shocked Mrs. Symmingtons only been dead a\nweek\n\nAim\u0439e Griffith shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Of course.",
    "Its absurd But you know what people are The Holland\ngirl is young and shes goodlooking  thats enough.",
    "And mind you\nbeing a nursery governess isnt much of a prospect for a girl.",
    "I\nwouldnt blame her if she wanted a settled home and a husband and\nwas playing her cards accordingly.",
    "Of course she went on.",
    "Poor Dick Symmington hasnt the least\nidea of all this Hes still completely knocked out by Mona\nSymmingtons death.",
    "But you know what men are If the girl is\nalways there making him comfortable looking after him being\nobviously devoted to the children  well he gets to be dependent on\nher.",
    "I said quietly So you do think that Elsie Holland is a designing\nhussy\n\nAim\u0439e Griffith flushed.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Im sorry for the girl  with people saying nasty things\nThats why I more or less told Megan that she ought to go home.",
    "It\nlooks better than having Dick Symmington and the girl alone in the\nhouse.",
    "I began to understand things.",
    "Aim\u0439e Griffith gave her jolly laugh.",
    "Youre shocked Mr. Burton at\nhearing what our gossipping little town thinks.",
    "I can tell you this they always think the worst\n\nShe laughed and nodded and strode away.",
    "I came upon Mr. Pye by the church.",
    "He was talking to Emily Barton\nwho looked pink and excited.",
    "Mr. Pye greeted me with every evidence of delight\n\nAh Burton good morning good morning How is your charming\nsister\n\nI told him that Joanna was well.",
    "But not joining our village Parliament We are all agog over the\nnews.",
    "Murder Real Sunday newspaper murder in our midst Not\nthe most interesting of crimes I fear.",
    "Somewhat sordid.",
    "The brutal\nmurder of a little serving maid.",
    "No finer points about the crime but\nstill undeniably news.",
    "Miss Barton said tremulously It is shocking  quite shocking.",
    "Mr. Pye turned on her But you enjoy it dear lady you enjoy it.",
    "Confess it now.",
    "You disapprove you deplore but there is the thrill.",
    "I\ninsist there is the thrill\n\nSuch a nice girl said Emily Barton.",
    "She came to me from St.\nClotildes Home.",
    "Quite a raw girl.",
    "But most teachable.",
    "She turned\ninto such a nice little maid.",
    "Partridge was very pleased with her.",
    "I said quickly She was coming to tea with Partridge yesterday\nafternoon.",
    "I turned to Pye I expect Aim\u0439e Griffith told you.",
    "My tone was quite casual.",
    "Pye responded apparently quite\nunsuspiciously\n\nShe did mention it yes.",
    "She said I remember that it was\nsomething quite new for servants to ring up on their employers\ntelephones.",
    "Partridge would never dream of doing such a thing said Miss\nEmily and I am really surprised at Agnes doing so.",
    "You are behind the times dear lady said Mr. Pye.",
    "My two terrors\nuse the telephone constantly and smoked all over the house until I\nobjected.",
    "But one darent say too much.",
    "Prescott is a divine cook\nthough temperamental and Mrs. Prescott is an admirable houseparlor maid.",
    "Yes indeed we all think youre very lucky.",
    "I intervened since I did not want the conversation to become\npurely domestic.",
    "The news of the murder has got around very quickly I said.",
    "Of course of course said Mr. Pye.",
    "The butcher the baker the\ncandlestick maker.",
    "Enter Rumor painted full of tongues Lymstock\nalas is going to the dogs.",
    "Anonymous letters murders any amount\nof criminal tendencies.",
    "Emily Barton said nervously They dont think  theres no idea that  that the two are connected\n\nMr. Pye pounced on the idea.",
    "An interesting speculation.",
    "The girl\nknew something therefore she was murdered.",
    "Yes yes most\npromising.",
    "How clever of you to think of it.",
    "I  I cant bear it.",
    "Emily Barton spoke abruptly and turned away walking very fast.",
    "Pye looked after her.",
    "His cherubic face was pursed up quizzically.",
    "He turned back to me and shook his head gently.",
    "A sensitive soul.",
    "A charming creature dont you think Absolutely\na period piece.",
    "Shes not you know of her own generation shes of\nthe generation before that.",
    "The mother must have been a woman of\nvery strong character.",

    "What do you really think about all this business I asked.",
    "Meaning by that\n\nAnonymous letters murder...\n\nOur local crime wave What do you\n\nI asked you first I said pleasantly.",
    "Mr. Pye said gently\n\nIm a student you know of abnormalities.",
    "They interest me.",
    "Such\napparently unlikely people do the most fantastic things.",
    "Take the\ncase of Lizzie Borden.",
    "Theres not really a reasonable explanation\nof that.",
    "In this case my advice to the police would be  study\ncharacter.",
    "Leave your fingerprints and your measuring of\nhandwriting and your microscopes.",
    "Notice instead what people do\n\n\fwith their hands and their little tricks of manner and the way they\neat their food and if they laugh sometimes for no apparent reason.",
    "I raised my eyebrows.",
    "Mad I said.",
    "Quite quite mad said Mr. Pye and added but youd never know\nit\n\nWho\n\nHis eyes met mine.",
    "He sighed.",
    "No no Burton that would be slander.",
    "We cant add slander to all\nthe rest of it.",
    "He fairly skipped off down the street.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nAs I stood staring after Mr. Pye the church door opened and the\nRev.",

    "But something  something as yes that poor unfortunate child\nwho was in service at the Symmingtons.",
    "I find it hard to believe I\nmust confess that we have a murderer in our midst Mr. erBurton.",

    "He leaned toward me.",
    "I learn that there have been anonymous letters going about.",
    "Have\nyou heard any rumor of such things\n\nI have heard I said.",
    "Cowardly and bastardly things.",
    "He paused and quoted an\nenormous stream of Latin.",
    "Those words of Horace are very\napplicable dont you think he said.",
    "Absolutely I said.",
    "There didnt seem anyone more I could profitably talk to so I went\nhome dropping in for some tobacco and for a bottle of sherry so\nas to get some of the humbler opinions on the crime.",
    "A narsty tramp seemed to be the verdict.",
    "Come to the door they do and whine and ask for money and then\nif its a girl alone in the house they turn narsty.",
    "My sister Dora over\nto Combe Acre she had a narsty experience one day  drunk he\nwas and selling those little printed poems...",
    "The story went on ending with the intrepid Dora courageously\nbanging the door in the mans face and taking refuge and\nbarricading herself in some vague retreat which I gathered from\nthe delicacy in mentioning it must be the lavatory.",
    "And there she stayed till her lady came home\n\nI reached Little Furze just a few minutes before lunch time.",
    "Joanna\nwas standing in the drawingroom window doing nothing at all and\nlooking as though her thoughts were miles away.",
    "What have you been doing with yourself I asked.",

    "Nothing particular.",
    "I went out on the veranda.",
    "Two chairs were drawn up to an iron\ntable and there were two empty sherry glasses.",
    "On another chair\nwas an object at which I looked with bewilderment for some time.",
    "What on earth is this\n\nOh said Joanna I think its a photograph of a diseased spleen or\nsomething.",
    "Dr. Griffith seemed to think Id be interested to see it.",
    "I looked at the photograph with some interest.",
    "Every man has his\nown ways of courting the female sex.",
    "I should not myself choose to\ndo it with photographs of spleens diseased or otherwise.",
    "Still no\ndoubt Joanna had asked for it\n\nIt looks most unpleasant I said.",
    "Joanna said it did rather.",
    "How was Griffith I asked.",
    "He looked tired and very unhappy.",
    "I think hes got something on\nhis mind.",
    "A spleen that wont yield to treatment\n\nDont be silly.",

    "Joanna whirled angrily out of the room.",
    "The diseased spleen was beginning to curl up in the sun.",
    "I took it by\none corner and brought it in to the drawing room.",
    "I had no affection\nfor it myself but I presumed it was one of Griffiths treasures.",
    "I stooped down and pulled out a heavy book from the bottom shelf\nof the bookcase in order to press the photograph flat between its\nleaves.",
    "It was a ponderous volume of somebodys sermons.",
    "The book came open in my hand in rather a surprising way.",
    "In another minute I saw why.",
    "From the middle of it a number of\npages had been neatly cut out.",
    "I stood staring at it.",
    "I looked at the title page.",
    "It had been published\nin 1840.",
    "There could be no doubt at all.",
    "I was looking at the book from the\npages of which the anonymous letters had been put together.",
    "Who\nhad cut them out\n\nWell to begin with it could be Emily Barton herself.",
    "She was\nperhaps the obvious person to think of.",
    "Or it could have been\nPartridge.",
    "But there were other possibilities.",
    "The pages could have been cut\nout by anyone who had been alone in this room any visitor for\n\n\finstance who had sat there waiting for Miss Emily.",
    "Or even anyone\nwho called on business.",
    "No that wasnt so likely.",
    "I had noticed that when one day a clerk\nfrom the bank had come to see me Partridge had shown him into\nthe little study at the back of the house.",
    "That was clearly the house\nroutine.",

    "They were elated at the find and I was patted on the back for what\nwas after all the sheerest piece of luck.",
    "Graves was not there but Nash was and rang up the other man.",

    "Mr. Symmington thought at first she had not left the office at all\nthat afternoon.",
    "He had Sir Henry Lushington with him all the\nafternoon and rang several times for Miss Ginch.",
    "I find however\nthat she did leave the office between three and four.",
    "She went out\nto get some high denomination of stamp of which they had run\nshort.",
    "The office boy could have gone but Miss Ginch elected to go\nsaying she had a headache and would like the air.",
    "She was not\ngone long.",
    "But long enough\n\nYes long enough to hurry along to the other end of the village slip\nthe letter in the box and hurry back.",
    "I must say however that I\ncannot find anybody who saw her near the Symmingtons house.",
    "Would they notice\n\n\fThey might and they might not.",
    "Who else is in your bag\n\nNash looked very straight ahead of him.",
    "Youll understand that we\ncant exclude anybody  anybody at all.",
    "No I said.",
    "I see that.",
    "He said gravely Miss Griffith Went to Brenton for a meeting of Girl\nGuides yesterday.",
    "She arrived rather late.",
    "You dont think...\n\nNo I dont think.",
    "But I dont know.",
    "Miss Griffith seems an eminently\nsane healthyminded woman  but I say I dont know.",
    "What about the previous week Could she have slipped the letter\nin the box\n\nIts possible.",
    "She was shopping in the town that afternoon.",
    "He\npaused.",
    "The same applies to Miss Emily Barton.",
    "She was out\nshopping early yesterday afternoon and she went for a walk to see\nsome friends on the road past the Symmingtons house the week\nbefore.",
    "I shook my head unbelievingly.",
    "Finding the cut book in Little Furze\nwas bound I knew to direct attention to the owner of that house\nbut when I remembered Miss Emily coming in yesterday so bright\n\n\fand happy and excited...",
    "Damn it all  excited...",
    "Yes excited  pink\ncheeks  shining eyes  surely not because  not because \n\nI said thickly This business is bad for one One sees things  one\nimagines things \n\nNash nodded sympathetically.",
    "Yes it isnt very pleasant to look\nupon these fellow creatures one meets as possible criminal\nlunatics.",
    "He paused for a moment then went on And theres Mr. Pye \n\nI said sharply Do you have considered him Nash smiled.",
    "Oh\nyes weve considered him all right.",
    "A very curious character  not I\nshould say a very nice character.",
    "He has no alibi.",
    "He was in his garden alone on both occasions.",
    "So youre not only suspecting women\n\nI dont think men wrote the letters  in fact Im sure of it  always\nexcepting our Mr. Pye that is to say whos got an abnormally\nfemale streak in his character.",
    "But weve checked up on everybody\nfor yesterday afternoon.",
    "Thats a murder case you see.",
    "Youre all\nright he grinned and sos your sister and Mr. Symmington didnt\nleave his office after he got there and Dr. Griffith was on a round in\nthe other direction and Ive checked up on his visits.",
    "He paused smiled again and said You see we are thorough.",
    "I said slowly So your case is eliminated down to those three Mr.\nPye Miss Griffith little Miss Barton\n\nOh no weve got a couple more  besides the vicars lady.",
    "Youve thought of her\n\nWeve thought of everybody but Mrs. Dane Calthrop is a little too\nopenly mad if you know what I mean.",
    "Still she could have done it.",
    "She was in a wood watching birds yesterday afternoon  and the\nbirds cant speak for her.",
    "He turned sharply as Owen Griffith came into the police station.",
    "Hullo Nash.",
    "I heard you were around asking for me this morning.",
    "Anything important\n\nInquest On Friday if that suits you Dr. Griffith.",
    "Right.",
    "Moresby and I are doing the P.M. tonight.",
    "Nash said\nTheres just one other thing Dr. Griffith.",
    "Mrs. Symmington was\ntaking some powders or something that you prescribed to her \n\nHe paused.",
    "Owen Griffith said interrogatively Yes\n\nWould an overdose of those powders have been fatal\n\n\fCertainly not Griffith said drily.",
    "Not unless shed taken about\ntwentyfive of them\n\nBut you once warned her about exceeding the dose so Miss\nHolland tells me.",
    "Oh that yes.",
    "Mrs. Symmington was the sort of woman who would\ngo and overdo anything she was given  fancy that to take twice as\nmuch would do her twice as much good and you dont want anyone\nto overdo even phenacetin or aspirin  bad for the heart.",
    "And\nanyway theres absolutely no doubt about the cause of death.",
    "It was\ncyanide.",
    "Oh I know that  you dont get my meaning.",
    "I only thought that\nwhen committing suicide youd prefer to take an overdose of a\nsoporific rather than to feed yourself prussic acid.",
    "Oh quite.",
    "On the other hand prussic acid is more dramatic and is\npretty certain to do the trick.",
    "With barbiturates for instance you\ncan bring the victim around if only a short time has elapsed.",
    "I see thank you Dr. Griffith.",
    "Griffith departed and I said goodbye to Nash.",
    "I went slowly up the\nhill home.",
    "Joanna was out  at least there was no sign of her and\nthere was an enigmatical memorandum scribbled on the telephone\nblock presumably for the guidance of either Partridge or myself\n\nIf Dr. Griffith rings up I cant go on Tuesday but could manage\nWednesday or Thursday.",
    "I raised my eyebrows and went into the drawing room.",
    "I sat down in\nthe most comfortable armchair  none of them were very\ncomfortable they tended to have straight backs and were\nreminiscent of the late Mrs. Barton  stretched out my legs and\ntried to think the whole thing out.",
    "With sudden annoyance I remembered that Owens arrival had\ninterrupted my conversation with the inspector and that he had\nmentioned two other people as being possibilities.",
    "I wondered who they were.",
    "Partridge perhaps for one After all the cut book had been found\nin this house.",
    "And Agnes could have been struck down quite\nunsuspectingly by her guide and mentor.",
    "No you couldnt eliminate\nPartridge.",
    "But who was the other\n\nSomebody perhaps that I didnt know Mrs. Cleat The original\nlocal suspect\n\nI closed my eyes.",
    "I considered the four people these strangely\nunlikely people in turn Gentle frail little Emily Barton What points\nwere there actually against her A starved life Dominated and\nrepressed from early childhood Too many sacrifices asked of her\nHer curious horror of discussing anything not quite nice Was\nthat actually a sign of inner preoccupation with just these themes\nWas I getting too horribly Freudian I remembered a doctor once\n\n\ftelling me that the mutterings of gentle maiden ladies when going\noff under an anesthetic were a revelation.",
    "You wouldnt think they\nknew such words\n\nAim\u0439e Griffith\n\nSurely nothing repressed or inhibited about her.",
    "Cheery\nmannish successful.",
    "A full busy life.",
    "Yet Mrs. Dane Calthrop had\nsaid Poor thing\n\nAnd there was something  something  some remembrance... Ah\nId got it.",
    "Owen Griffith saying something like We had an outbreak\nof anonymous letters up north where I had a practice.",
    "Had that been Aim\u0439e Griffiths work too Surely rather a\ncoincidence.",
    "Two outbreaks of the same thing.",
    "Stop a minute theyd tracked down the author of those.",
    "Griffith had\nsaid so.",
    "A schoolgirl.",
    "Cold it was suddenly  must be a draft from the window.",
    "I turned\nuncomfortably in my chair.",
    "Why did I suddenly feel so queer and\nupset\n\nGo on thinking... Aim\u0439e Griffith Perhaps it was Aim\u0439e Griffith not\nthat other girl And Aim\u0439e had come down here and started her\ntricks again.",
    "And that was why Owen Griffith was looking so\nunhappy and hagridden.",
    "He suspected.",
    "Yes he suspected...\n\n\fMr. Pye Not somehow a very nice little man.",
    "I could imagine him\nstaging the whole business laughing...\n\nThat telephone message on the telephone pad in the hall  why did I\nkeep thinking of it Griffith and Joanna  he was falling for her.",
    "No\nthat wasnt why the message worried me.",
    "It was something else...\n\nMy senses were swimming sleep was very near.",
    "I repeated\nidiotically to myself No smoke without fire.",
    "No smoke without\nfire... Thats it... it all links up together... \n\nAnd then I was walking down the street with Megan and Elsie\nHolland passed.",
    "She was dressed as a bride and people were\nmurmuring Shes going to marry Dr. Griffith at last.",
    "Of course\ntheyve been engaged secretly for years...",
    "There we were in the church and Dane Calthrop was reading the\nservice in Latin.",
    "And in the middle of it Mrs. Dane Calthrop jumped up and cried\nenergetically Its got to be stopped I tell you.",
    "Its got to be\nstopped\n\nFor a minute or two I didnt know whether I was asleep or awake.",
    "Then my brain cleared and I realized I was in the drawing room of\nLittle Furze and that Mrs. Dane Calthrop had just come through the\nwindow and was standing in front of me saying with nervous\nviolence\n\n\fIt has got to be stopped I tell you.",
    "I jumped up.",
    "I beg your pardon I said.",
    "Im afraid I was asleep.",
    "What did you say\n\nMrs. Dane Calthrop beat one fist fiercely on the palm of her other\nhand.",
    "Its got to be stopped.",
    "These letters Murder You cant go on\nhaving poor innocent children like Agnes Woddell killed\n\nYoure quite right I said.",
    "But how do you propose to set about\nit\n\nMrs. Dane Calthrop said Weve got to do something\n\nI smiled perhaps in rather a superior fashion.",
    "And what do you\nsuggest that we should do\n\nGet the whole thing cleared up I said this wasnt a wicked place.",
    "I\nwas wrong.",
    "It is.",
    "I felt annoyed.",
    "Yes my dear woman I said not too politely but\nwhat are you going to do\n\nMrs. Dane Calthrop said Put a stop to it all of course.",
    "The police are doing their best.",
    "If Agnes could be killed yesterday their best isnt good enough.",
    "So you know better than they do\n\nNot at all.",
    "I dont know anything at all.",
    "Thats why Im going to call\nin an expert.",
    "I shook my head.",
    "You cant do that.",
    "Scotland Yard will only take\nover on a demand from the chief constable of the county.",
    "Actually\nthey have sent Graves.",
    "I dont mean that kind of an expert.",
    "I dont mean someone who\nknows about anonymous letters or even about murder.",
    "I mean\nsomeone who knows people.",
    "Dont you see We want someone who\nknows a great deal about wickedness\n\nIt was a queer point of view.",
    "But it was somehow stimulating.",
    "Before I could say anything more Mrs. Dane Calthrop nodded her\nhead at me and said in a quick confident tone\n\nIm going to see about it right away.",
    "And she went out of the window again.",
    "The next week I think was one of the queerest times I have ever\npassed through.",
    "It had an odd dream quality.",
    "Nothing seemed real.",
    "The inquest on Agnes Woddell was held and the curious of\nLymstock attended en masse.",
    "No new facts came to light and the\nonly possible verdict was returned Murder by person or persons\nunknown.",
    "So poor little Agnes Woddell having had her hour of limelight was\nduly buried in the quiet old churchyard and life in Lymstock went on\nas before.",
    "No that last statement is untrue.",
    "Not as before...",
    "There was a halfscared halfavid gleam in almost everybodys eye.",
    "Neighbor looked at neighbor.",
    "One thing had been brought out\nclearly at the inquest  it was most unlikely that any stranger had\nkilled Agnes Woddell.",
    "No tramps or unknown men had been noticed\nor reported in the district.",
    "Somewhere then in Lymstock walking\ndown the High Street shopping passing the time of day was a\nperson who had cracked a defenseless girls skull and driven a\nsharp skewer home to her brain.",
    "And no one knew who that person was.",
    "As I say the days went on in a kind of dream.",
    "I looked at everyone I\nmet in a new light the light of a possible murderer.",
    "It was not an\nagreeable sensation\n\nAnd in the evenings with the curtain drawn Joanna and I sat\ntalking talking arguing going over in turn all the various\npossibilities that still seemed so fantastic and incredible.",
    "Joanna held firm to her theory of Mr. Pye.",
    "I after wavering a little\nhad gone back to my original suspect Miss Ginch.",
    "But we went over the possible names again and again\n\n\fMr. Pye\n\nMiss Ginch\n\nMrs. Dane Calthrop\n\nAim\u0439e Griffith\n\nEmily Barton\n\nPartridge\n\nAnd all the time nervously apprehensively we waited for\nsomething to happen.",
    "But nothing did happen.",
    "Nobody so far as we knew received any\nmore letters.",
    "Nash made periodic appearances in the town but\nwhat he was doing and what traps the police were setting I had no\nidea.",
    "Graves had gone again.",
    "Emily Barton came to tea.",
    "Megan\ncame to lunch.",
    "Owen Griffith went about his practice.",
    "We went and\ndrank sherry with Mr. Pye.",
    "And we went to tea at the vicarage.",
    "I was glad to find that Mrs. Dane Calthrop displayed none of the\nmilitant ferocity she had shown on the occasion of our last meeting.",
    "I think she had forgotten all about it.",
    "She seemed now principally concerned with the destruction of\nwhite butterflies so as to preserve cauliflower and cabbage plants.",
    "Our afternoon at the vicarage was really one of the most peaceful\nwe had spent.",
    "It was an attractive old house and had a big shabby\ncomfortable drawing room with faded rose cretonne.",
    "The Dane\nCalthrops had a guest staying with them an amiable elderly lady\nwho was knitting something with white fleecy wool.",
    "We had very\ngood hot scones for tea the vicar came in and beamed placidly on\nus while he pursued his gentle erudite conversation.",
    "It was very\npleasant.",
    "I dont mean that we got away from the topic of the murder\nbecause we didnt.",
    "Miss Marple the guest was naturally thrilled by the subject.",
    "As she\nsaid apologetically\n\nWe have so little to talk about in the country She had made up\nher mind that the dead girl must have been just like her Edith.",
    "Such a nice little maid and so willing but sometimes just a little\nslow to take in things.",
    "Miss Marple also had a cousin whose nieces sisterinlaw had had a\ngreat deal of annoyance and trouble over some anonymous letters\nso that too was very interesting to the charming old lady.",
    "But tell me dear she said to Mrs. Dane Calthrop what do the\nvillage people  I mean the townspeople  say What do they think\n\nMrs. Cleat still I suppose said Joanna.",
    "Oh no said Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "Not now.",
    "Miss Marple asked who Mrs. Cleat was.",
    "Joanna said she was the village witch.",
    "Thats right isnt it Mrs. Dane Calthrop\n\nThe vicar murmured a long Latin quotation about I think the evil\npower of witches to which we all listened in respectful and\nuncomprehending silence.",
    "Shes a very silly woman said his wife.",
    "Likes to show off.",
    "Goes\nout to gather herbs and things at the full of the moon and takes care\nthat everybody in the place knows about it.",
    "And silly girls go and consult her I suppose said Miss Marple.",
    "I saw the vicar getting ready to unload more Latin on us and I asked\nhastily But why shouldnt people suspect her of the murder now\nThey thought the letters were her doing.",
    "Miss Marple said firmly\n\nOh But the girl was killed with a skewer so I hear.",
    "Very\nunpleasant Well naturally that takes all suspicion away from this\nMrs. Cleat.",
    "Because you see she could illwish her so that the girl\nwould waste away and die from natural causes.",
    "Strange how those old beliefs linger said the vicar.",
    "In early\nChristian times local superstitions were wisely incorporated with\nChristian doctrines and their most unpleasant attributes gradually\neliminated.",
    "It isnt superstition weve got to deal with here said Mrs. Dane\nCalthrop but facts.",
    "And very unpleasant facts I said.",
    "As you say Mr. Burton said Miss Marple.",
    "Now you  excuse me if\nI am being too personal  are a stranger here and have a\nknowledge of the world and of various aspects of life.",
    "It seems to\nme that you ought to be able to find a solution to this distasteful\nproblem.",
    "I smiled.",
    "The best solution I have had was a dream.",
    "In my dream it all fitted\nin and panned out beautifully.",
    "Unfortunately when I woke up the\nwhole thing was nonsense\n\nHow interesting though.",
    "Do tell me how the nonsense went.",
    "Oh it all started with the silly phrase No smoke without fire.",
    "People have been saying that ad nauseam.",
    "And then I got it mixed\nup with war terms.",
    "Smoke screen scrap of paper telephone\nmessages  no that was another dream.",
    "And what was that dream\n\n\fThe old lady was so eager about it that I felt sure she was a secret\nreader of Napoleons Book of Dreams which had been the great\nstandby of my old nurse.",
    "Oh Only Elsie Holland  the Symmingtons nursery governess you\nknow was getting married to Dr. Griffith and the vicar here was\nreading the service in Latin Very appropriate dear murmured\nMrs. Dane Calthrop to her spouse and then Mrs. Dane Calthrop got\nup and forbade the banns and said it had got to be stopped\n\nBut that part I added with a smile was true.",
    "I woke up and found\nyou standing over me saying it.",
    "And I was quite right said Mrs. Dane Calthrop but quite mildly I\nwas glad to note.",
    "But where did a telephone message come in asked Miss Marple\ncrinkling her brows.",
    "Im afraid Im being rather stupid.",
    "That wasnt in the dream.",
    "It was\njust before it.",
    "I came through the hall and noticed Joanna had\nwritten down a message to be given to someone if they rang up.",
    "Miss Marple leaned forward.",
    "There was a pink spot in each cheek.",
    "Will you think me very inquisitive and very rude if I ask just what\nthat message was She cast a glance at Joanna.",
    "I do apologise\nmy dear.",
    "Joanna however was highly entertained.",
    "Oh I dont mind she assured the old lady.",
    "I cant remember\nanything about it myself but perhaps Jerry can.",
    "It must have been\nsomething quite trivial.",
    "Solemnly I repeated the message as best I could remember it\nenormously tickled at the old ladys rapt attention.",
    "I was afraid the actual words were going to disappoint her but\nperhaps she had some sentimental idea of a romance for she\nnodded her head and smiled and seemed pleased.",
    "I see she said.",
    "I thought it might be something like that.",
    "Mrs. Dane Calthrop said sharply Like what Jane\n\nSomething quite ordinary said Miss Marple.",
    "She looked at me thoughtfully for a moment or two then she said\nunexpectedly I can see you are a very clever young man  but with\nnot quite enough confidence in yourself.",
    "You ought to have\n\nJoanna gave a loud hoot.",
    "For goodness sake dont encourage him\nto feel like that.",
    "He thinks quite enough of himself as it is.",
    "Be quiet Joanna I said.",
    "Miss Marple understands me.",
    "Miss\nMarple had resumed her fleecy knitting.",
    "You know she observed\npensively to commit a successful murder must be very much like\nbringing off a conjuring trick.",
    "The quickness of the hand deceives the eye\n\nNot only that.",
    "Youve got to make people look at the wrong thing\nand in the wrong place  misdirection they call it I believe.",
    "Well I remarked so far everybody seems to have looked in the\nwrong place for our lunatic at large.",
    "I should be inclined myself said Miss Marple to look for\nsomebody very sane.",
    "Yes I said thoughtfully thats what Nash said.",
    "I remember he\nstressed respectability too.",
    "Yes agreed Miss Marple.",
    "Thats very important.",
    "Well we all seemed to agree.",
    "I addressed Mrs. Calthrop.",
    "Nash thinks I said that there will be\nmore anonymous letters.",
    "What do you think\n\nThere may be she said slowly I suppose.",
    "If the police think that there will have to be no doubt said Miss\nMarple.",
    "I went on doggedly to Mrs. Dane Calthrop Are you still sorry for\nthe writer\n\nShe flushed.",
    "Why not\n\n\fI dont think I agree with you dear said Miss Marple.",
    "Not in this\ncase.",
    "I said hotly Theyve driven one woman to suicide and caused\nuntold misery and heartburnings\n\nHave you had one Miss Burton asked Miss Marple of Joanna.",
    "Joanna gurgled Oh yes It said the most frightful things.",
    "Im afraid said Miss Marple that the people who are young and\npretty are apt to be singled out by the writer.",
    "Thats why I certainly think its odd that Elsie Holland hasnt had\nany I said.",
    "Let me see said Miss Marple.",
    "Is that the Symmingtons nursery\ngoverness  the one you dreamed about Mr. Burton\n\nYes.",
    "Shes probably had one and wont say so said Joanna.",
    "No I said I believe her.",
    "So does Nash.",
    "Dear me said Miss Marple.",
    "Now thats very interesting.",
    "Thats\nthe most interesting thing Ive heard yet.",
    "As we were going home Joanna told me that I ought not to have\nrepeated what Nash said about more letters coming.",
    "Why not\n\nBecause Mrs. Dane Calthrop might be it.",
    "You dont really believe that\n\nIm not sure.",
    "Shes a queer woman.",
    "We began our discussion of probables all over again.",
    "It was two nights later that I was coming back in the car from\nExhampton.",
    "I had had dinner there and then started back and it was\nalready dark before I got into Lymstock.",
    "Something was wrong with the car lights and after slowing up and\nswitching on and off I finally got out to see what I could do.",
    "I was\nsome time fiddling but I managed to fix them up finally.",
    "The road was quite deserted.",
    "Nobody in Lymstock is about after\ndark.",
    "The first few houses were just ahead among them the ugly\ngabled building of the Womens Institute.",
    "It loomed up in the dim\nstarlight and something impelled me to go and have a look at it.",
    "I\ndont know whether I had caught a faint glimpse of a stealthy figure\nflitting through the gate  if so it must have been so indeterminate\nthat it did not register in my conscious mind but I did suddenly feel\na kind of overwhelming curiosity about the place.",
    "The gate was slightly ajar and I pushed it open and walked in.",
    "A\nshort path and four steps led up to the door.",
    "I stood there a moment hesitating.",
    "What was I really doing there I\ndidnt know and then suddenly just near at hand I caught the\nsound of a rustle.",
    "It sounded like a womans dress.",
    "I took a sharp turn and went around the corner of the building\ntoward where the sound had come from.",
    "I couldnt see anybody.",
    "I went on and again turned a corner.",
    "I was\nat the back of the house now and suddenly I saw only two feet\naway from me an open window.",
    "I crept up to it and listened.",
    "I could hear nothing but somehow or\nother I felt convinced that there was someone inside.",
    "My back wasnt too good for acrobatics as yet but I managed to\nhoist myself up and drop over the sill inside.",
    "I made rather a noise\nunfortunately.",
    "I stood just inside the window listening.",
    "Then I walked forward my\nhands outstretched.",
    "I heard then the faintest sound ahead of me to\nmy right.",
    "I had a torch in my pocket and I switched it on.",
    "Immediately a low\nsharp voice said Put that out.",
    "I obeyed instantly for in that brief second I had recognized\nSuperintendent Nash.",
    "I felt him take my arm and propel me through a door and into a\npassage.",
    "Here where there was no window to betray our presence\nto anyone outside he switched on a lamp and looked at me more in\nsorrow than in anger.",
    "You would have to butt in just that minute Mr. Burton.",
    "Sorry I apologized.",
    "But I got a hunch that I was on to\nsomething.",
    "And so you were probably.",
    "Did you see anyone\n\nI hesitated.",
    "Im not sure I said slowly.",
    "Ive got a vague feeling I saw someone\nsneak in through the front gate but I didnt really see anyone.",
    "Then I\nheard a rustle around the side of the house.",
    "Nash nodded.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Somebody came around the house\nbefore you.",
    "He  or she  hesitated by the window then went on\nquickly  heard you I expect.",
    "I apologized again.",
    "Whats the big idea I asked.",
    "Nash said\n\nIm banking on the fact that an anonymous letter writer cant stop\nwriting letters.",
    "She may know its dangerous but shell have to do\nit.",
    "Its like a craving for drink or drugs.",
    "I nodded.",
    "Now you see Mr. Burton I fancy whoever it is will want to keep the\nletters looking the same as much as possible.",
    "Shes got the cutout\npages of that book and can go on using letters and words cut out of\nthem.",
    "But the envelopes present a difficulty.",
    "Shell want to type\nthem on the same machine.",
    "She cant risk using another typewriter\nor her own handwriting.",
    "Do you really think shell go on with the game I asked\nincredulously.",
    "Yes I do.",
    "And Ill bet you anything you like shes full of confidence.",
    "Theyre always vain as hell these people Well then I figured out\nthat whoever it was would come to the Institute after dark so as to\nget at the typewriter.",
    "Miss Ginch I said.",
    "Maybe.",
    "You dont know yet\n\nI dont know.",
    "But you suspect\n\nYes.",
    "But somebodys very cunning Mr. Burton.",
    "Somebody knows\nall the tricks of the game.",
    "I could imagine some of the network that Nash had spread abroad.",
    "I\nhad no doubt that every letter written by a suspect and posted or\nleft by hand was immediately inspected.",
    "Sooner or later the\ncriminal would slip up would grow careless.",
    "For the third time I apologized for my zealous and unwanted\npresence.",
    "Oh well said Nash philosophically it cant be helped.",
    "Better\nluck next time.",
    "I went out into the night.",
    "A dim figure was standing beside my car.",
    "To my astonishment I recognized Megan.",
    "Hullo she said.",
    "I thought this was your car.",
    "What have you been\ndoing\n\nWhat are you doing is much more to the point I said.",
    "Im out for a walk.",
    "I like walking at night.",
    "Nobody stops you and\nsays silly things and I like the stars and things smell better and\neveryday things look all mysterious.",
    "All of that I grant you freely I said.",
    "But only cats and witches\nwalk in the dark.",
    "Theyll wonder about you at home.",
    "No they wont.",
    "They never wonder where I am or what Im doing.",
    "How are you getting on I asked.",
    "All right I suppose.",
    "Miss Holland look after you and all that\n\nElsies all right.",
    "She cant help being a perfect fool.",
    "Unkind  but probably true I said.",
    "Hop in and Ill drive you\nhome.",
    "It was not quite true that Megan was never missed.",
    "Symmington\nwas standing on the doorstep as we drove up.",
    "He peered toward\nus.",
    "Hullo is Megan there\n\nYes I said.",
    "Ive brought her home.",
    "Symmington said sharply You mustnt go off like this without\ntelling us Megan.",
    "Miss Holland has been quite worried about you.",
    "Megan muttered something and went past him into the house.",
    "Symmington sighed.",
    "A grownup girl is a great responsibility with\nno mother to look after her.",
    "Shes too old for school I suppose.",
    "He looked toward me rather suspiciously.",
    "I suppose you took her\nfor a drive\n\nI thought it best to leave it like that.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nOn the following day I went mad.",
    "Looking back on it that is really\nthe only explanation I can find.",
    "I was due for my monthly visit to Marcus Kent...",
    "I went up by train.",
    "To my intense surprise Joanna elected to stay behind.",
    "As a rule she\nwas eager to come and we usually stayed up for a couple of days.",
    "This time however I proposed to return the same day by the\nevening train but even so I was astonished at Joanna.",
    "She merely\nsaid enigmatically that shed got plenty to do and why spend hours\nin a nasty stuffy train when it was a lovely day in the country\n\nThat of course was undeniable but sounded very unlike Joanna.",
    "She said she didnt want the car so I was to drive it to the station\nand leave it parked there against my return.",
    "The station of Lymstock is situated for some obscure reason\nknown to railway companies only quite half a mile from Lymstock\nitself.",
    "Halfway along the road I overtook Megan shuffling along in an\naimless manner.",
    "I pulled up.",
    "Hullo what are you doing\n\nJust out for a walk.",
    "But not what is called a good brisk walk I gather.",
    "You were\ncrawling along like a dispirited crab.",
    "Well I wasnt going anywhere particular.",
    "Then youd better come and see me off at the station.",
    "I opened\nthe door of the car and Megan jumped in.",
    "Where are you going she asked.",
    "London.",
    "To see my doctor.",
    "Your backs not worse is it\n\nNo its practically all right again.",
    "Im expecting him to be very\npleased about it.",
    "Megan nodded.",
    "We drew up at the station.",
    "I parked the car and went in and bought\nmy ticket at the booking office.",
    "There were very few people on the\nplatform and nobody I knew.",
    "You wouldnt like to lend me a penny would you said Megan.",
    "Then Id get a bit of chocolate out of the slot machine.",
    "Here you are baby I said handing her the coin in question.",
    "Sure you wouldnt like some clear gums or some throat pastilles as\nwell\n\nI like chocolate best said Megan without suspecting sarcasm.",
    "She went off to the chocolate machine and I looked after her with a\nfeeling of mounting irritation.",
    "She was wearing troddenover shoes and coarse unattractive\nstockings and a particularly shapeless jumper and skirt.",
    "I dont\nknow why all this should have infuriated me but it did.",
    "I said angrily as she came back Why do you wear those disgusting\nstockings\n\nMegan looked down at them surprised.",
    "Whats the matter with\nthem\n\nEverythings the matter with them.",
    "Theyre loathsome.",
    "And why\nwear a pullover like a decayed cabbage\n\nIts all right isnt it Ive had it for years.",
    "So I should imagine.",
    "And why do you \n\nAt this minute the train came in and interrupted my angry lecture.",
    "I got into an empty firstclass carriage let down the window and\nleaned out to continue the conversation.",
    "Megan stood below me her face upturned.",
    "She asked me why I was\nso cross.",
    "Im not cross I said untruly.",
    "It just infuriates me to see you so\nslack and not caring how you look.",
    "I couldnt look nice anyway so what does it matter\n\nCut it I said.",
    "Id like to see you turned out properly.",
    "Id like to\ntake you to London and outfit you from tip to toe.",
    "I wish you could said Megan.",
    "The train began to move.",
    "I looked down into Megans upturned\nwistful face.",
    "And then as I have said madness came upon me.",
    "I opened the door grabbed Megan with one arm and fairly hauled\nher into the carriage.",
    "There was an outraged shout from a porter but all he could do was\ndexterously to bang shut the door again.",
    "I pulled Megan up from the\nfloor where my impetuous action had landed her.",
    "What on earth did you do that for she demanded rubbing one\nknee.",
    "Shut up I said.",
    "Youre coming to London with me and when Ive\ndone with you you wont know yourself.",
    "Ill show you what you can\n\n\flook like if you try.",
    "Im tired of seeing you mouch about down at heel\nand all anyhow.",
    "Oh said Megan in an ecstatic whisper.",
    "The ticket collector came along and I bought Megan a return ticket.",
    "She sat in her corner looking at me in a kind of awed respect.",
    "I say she said when the man had gone.",
    "You are sudden arent\nyou\n\nVery I said.",
    "It runs in our family.",
    "How explain to Megan the impulse that had come over me  She\nhad looked like a wistful dog being left behind.",
    "She now had on her\nface the incredulous pleasure of the dog who has been taken on the\nwalk after all.",
    "I suppose you dont know London very well I said to Megan.",
    "Yes I do said Megan.",
    "I always went through it to school.",
    "And\nIve been to the dentist there and to a pantomime.",
    "This I said darkly will be a different London.",
    "We arrived with half an hour to spare before my appointment in\nHarley Street.",
    "I took a taxi and we drove straight to Mirotin Joannas dressmaker.",
    "Mirotin is in the flesh an unconventional and breezy woman of\n\n\ffortyfive Mary Grey.",
    "She is a clever woman and very good\ncompany.",
    "I have always liked her.",
    "I said to Megan Youre my cousin.",
    "Why\n\nDont argue I said.",
    "Mary Grey was being firm with a stout woman who was enamored\nof a skintight powderblue evening dress.",
    "I detached her and took\nher aside.",
    "Listen I said.",
    "Ive brought a little cousin of mine along.",
    "Joanna\nwas coming up but was prevented.",
    "But she said I could leave it all\nto you.",
    "You see what the girl looks like now\n\nI most certainly do said Mary Grey with feeling.",
    "Well I want her turned out right in every particular from head to\nfoot.",
    "Carte blanche.",
    "Stockings shoes undies everything By the\nway the man who does Joannas hair is close around here isnt\nhe\n\nAntoine Around the corner.",
    "Ill see to that too.",
    "Youre a woman in a thousand.",
    "Oh I shall enjoy it  apart from the money  and thats not to be\nsneezed at in these days  half my damned brutes of women never\npay their bills.",
    "But as I say I shall enjoy it.",
    "She shot a quick professional glance at Megan standing a little way\noff.",
    "Shes got a lovely figure.",
    "You must have Xray eyes I said.",
    "She looks completely\nshapeless to me.",
    "Mary Grey laughed.",
    "Its these schools she said.",
    "They seem to take a pride in turning\nout girls who preen themselves on looking like nothing on earth.",
    "They call it being sweet and unsophisticated.",
    "Sometimes it takes a\nwhole season before a girl can pull herself together and look\nhuman.",
    "Dont worry leave it all to me.",
    "Right I said.",
    "Ill come back and fetch her about six.",
    "Marcus Kent was pleased with me.",
    "He told me that I surpassed his\nwildest expectations.",
    "You must have the constitution of an elephant he said to make a\ncomeback like this.",
    "Oh well wonderful what country air and no late\nhours or excitement will do for a man if he can only stick it.",
    "I grant you your first two I said.",
    "But dont think that the country\nis free from excitement.",
    "Weve had a good deal in my part.",
    "What sort of excitement\n\nMurder I said.",
    "Marcus Kent pursed up his mouth and whistled.",
    "Some bucolic love\ntragedy Farm lad kills his lass\n\nNot at all.",
    "A crafty determined lunatic killer.",
    "I havent read anything about it When did they lay him by the\nheels\n\nThey havent and its a she\n\nWhew Im not sure that Lymstocks quite the right place for you\nold boy.",
    "I said firmly Yes it is.",
    "And youre not going to get me out of it.",
    "Marcus Kent has a low mind.",
    "He said at once So thats it Found a\nblonde\n\nNot at all I said with a guilty thought of Elsie Holland.",
    "Its merely\nthat the psychology of crime interests me a good deal.",
    "Oh all right.",
    "It certainly hasnt done you any harm so far but just\nmake sure that your lunatic killer doesnt obliterate you\n\nNo fear of that I said.",
    "What about dining with me this evening You can tell me all about\nyour revolting murder.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Im booked.",
    "Date with a lady  eh Yes youre definitely on the mend.",
    "I suppose you could call it that I said rather tickled at the idea of\nMegan in the role.",
    "I was at Mirotins at six oclock when the establishment was\nofficially closing.",
    "Mary Grey came to meet me at the top of the stairs\noutside the showroom.",
    "She had a finger to her lips.",
    "Youre going to have a shock If I say it myself Ive put in a good bit\nof work.",
    "I went on into the big showroom.",
    "Megan was standing looking at\nherself in a long mirror.",
    "I give you my word I hardly recognized her\nFor the minute it took my breath away.",
    "Tall and slim as a willow with\ndelicate ankles and feet shown off by sheer silk stockings and wellcut shoes.",
    "Yes lovely feet and hands small bones  quality and\ndistinction in every line of her.",
    "Her hair had been trimmed and\nshaped to her head and it was glowing like a glossy chestnut.",
    "Theyd had the sense to leave her face alone.",
    "She was not made up\nor if she was it was so slight and delicate that it did not show.",
    "Her\nmouth needed no lipstick.",
    "Moreover there was about her something that I had never seen\nbefore a new innocent pride in the arch of her neck.",
    "She looked at\nme gravely with a small shy smile.",
    "I do look  rather nice dont I said Megan.",
    "Nice I said.",
    "Nice isnt the word Come on out to dinner and if\nevery second man doesnt turn round to look at you Ill be\nsurprised.",
    "Youll knock all the other girls into a cocked hat.",
    "Megan was not beautiful but she was unusual and strikinglooking.",
    "She had personality.",
    "She walked into the restaurant ahead of me\nand as the head waiter hurried toward us I felt the thrill of idiotic\npride that a man feels when he has got something out of the\nordinary with him.",
    "We had cocktails first and lingered over them.",
    "Then we dined.",
    "And\nlater we danced.",
    "Megan was keen to dance and I didnt want to\ndisappoint her but for some reason or other I hadnt thought she\nwould dance well.",
    "But she did.",
    "She was light as a feather in my\narms and her body and feet followed the rhythm perfectly.",
    "Gosh I said.",
    "You can dance\n\nShe seemed a little surprised.",
    "Well of course I can.",
    "We had dancing class every week at school.",
    "It takes more than dancing class to make a dancer I said.",
    "We\nwent back to our table.",
    "Isnt this food lovely said Megan.",
    "And everything\n\nShe heaved a delighted sigh.",
    "Exactly my sentiments I said.",
    "It was a delirious evening.",
    "I was still mad.",
    "Megan brought me down\nto earth when she said doubtfully Oughtnt we to be going home\n\nMy jaw dropped.",
    "Yes definitely I was mad.",
    "I had forgotten\neverything I was in a world divorced from reality existing in it with\nthe creature I had created.",
    "Good Lord I said.",
    "I realized that the last train had gone.",
    "Stay there I said.",
    "Im going to telephone.",
    "I rang up the Llewellyn Hire people and ordered their biggest and\nfastest car to come around as soon as possible.",
    "I came back to Megan.",
    "The last train has gone I said.",
    "So were going home by car.",
    "Are we What fun\n\n\fWhat a nice child she was I thought.",
    "So pleased with everything so\nunquestioning accepting all my suggestions without fuss or bother.",
    "The car came and it was large and fast but all the same it was very\nvery late when we came into Lymstock.",
    "Suddenly consciencestricken I said Theyll have been sending\nout search parties for you\n\nBut Megan seemed in an equable mood.",
    "Oh I dont think so she\nsaid vaguely.",
    "I often go out and dont come home for lunch.",
    "Yes my dear child but youve been out for tea and dinner too.",
    "However Megans lucky star was in the ascendant.",
    "The house was\ndark and silent.",
    "On Megans advice we went around to the back\nand threw stones at Roses window.",
    "In due course Rose looked out\nand with many suppressed exclamations and palpitations came\ndown to let us in.",
    "Well now and I saying you were asleep in your bed.",
    "The master\nand Miss Holland  slight sniff after Miss Hollands name  had\nearly supper and went for a drive.",
    "I said Id keep an eye to the boys.",
    "I thought I heard you come in when I was up in the nursery trying to\nquiet Colin who was playing up but you werent about when I came\ndown so I thought youd gone up to bed.",
    "And thats what I said when\nthe master came in and asked for you.",
    "I cut short the conversation by remarking that that was where\nMegan had better go now.",
    "Good night said Megan and thank you awfully.",
    "Its been the\nloveliest day Ive ever had.",
    "I drove home slightly lightheaded still and tipped the chauffeur\nhandsomely offering him a bed if he liked.",
    "But he preferred to drive\nback through the night.",
    "The hall door had opened during our colloquy and as he drove away\nit was flung wide open and Joanna said So its you at last is it\n\nWere you worried about me I asked coming in and shutting the\ndoor.",
    "Joanna went into the drawing room and I followed her.",
    "There was a\ncoffeepot on the trivet and Joanna made herself coffee while I\nhelped myself to a whiskyandsoda.",
    "Worried about you No of course not.",
    "I thought youd decided to\nstay in town and have a binge.",
    "Ive had a binge  of a kind.",
    "I grinned and then began to laugh.",
    "Joanna asked what I was laughing at and I told her.",
    "But Jerry you must have been mad  quite mad\n\nI suppose I was.",
    "But my dear boy you cant do things like that  not in a place like\nthis.",
    "It will be all around Lymstock tomorrow.",
    "I suppose it will.",
    "But after all Megans only a child.",
    "She isnt.",
    "Shes twenty.",
    "You cant take a girl of twenty to London\nand buy her clothes without a most frightful scandal.",
    "Good\ngracious Jerry youll probably have to marry the girl.",
    "Joanna was\nhalf serious half laughing.",
    "It was at that moment that I made a very important discovery.",
    "Damn it all I said.",
    "I dont mind if I do.",
    "In fact  I should like it.",
    "A very funny expression came over Joannas face.",
    "She got up and\nsaid drily as she went toward the door Yes Ive known that for\nsome time... \n\nShe left me standing glass in hand aghast at my new discovery.",
    "I dont know what the usual reactions are of a man who goes to\npropose marriage.",
    "In fiction his throat is dry and his collar feels too tight and he is in a\npitiable state of nervousness.",
    "I didnt feel at all like that.",
    "Having thought of a good idea I just\nwanted to get it all settled as soon as possible.",
    "I didnt see any\nparticular need for embarrassment.",
    "I went along to the Symmingtons house about eleven oclock.",
    "I rang the bell and when Rose came I asked for Miss Megan.",
    "It was the knowing look that Rose gave me that first made me feel\nslightly shy.",
    "She put me in the little morning room and while waiting there I\nhoped uneasily that they hadnt been upsetting Megan.",
    "When the door opened and I wheeled around I was instantly\nrelieved.",
    "Megan was not looking shy or upset at all.",
    "Her head was still like a glossy chestnut and she wore that air of\npride and selfrespect that she had acquired yesterday.",
    "She was in her old clothes again but she had managed to make\nthem look different.",
    "Its wonderful what knowledge of her own\nattractiveness will do for a girl.",
    "Megan I realized suddenly had\ngrown up.",
    "I suppose I must really have been rather nervous otherwise I\nshould not have opened the conversation by saying affectionately\n\nHullo catfish It was hardly in the circumstances a loverlike\ngreeting.",
    "It seemed to suit Megan.",
    "She grinned and said Hullo\n\nLook here I said.",
    "You didnt get into a row about yesterday I\nhope\n\nMegan said with assurance Oh no and then blinked and said\nvaguely Yes I believe I did.",
    "I mean they said a lot of things and\nseemed to think it had been very odd but then you know what\npeople are and what fusses they make all about nothing.",
    "I was relieved to see that shocked disapproval had slipped off\nMegan like water off a ducks back.",
    "I came around this morning I said because Ive a suggestion to\nmake.",
    "You see I like you a lot and I think you like me \n\nFrightfully said Megan with rather disquieting enthusiasm.",
    "And we get on awfully well together so I think it would be a good\nidea if we got married.",
    "Oh said Megan.",
    "She looked surprised.",
    "Just that.",
    "Not startled.",
    "Not shocked.",
    "Just\nmildly surprised.",
    "You mean you really want to marry me she asked with the air of\none getting a thing perfectly clear.",
    "More than anything in the world I said  and I meant it.",
    "You mean youre in love with me\n\nIm in love with you.",
    "Her eyes were steady and grave.",
    "She said I think youre the nicest\nperson in the world  but Im not in love with you.",
    "Ill make you love me.",
    "That wouldnt do.",
    "I dont want to be made.",
    "She paused and then\nsaid gravely Im not the sort of wife for you.",
    "Im better at hating\nthan at loving.",
    "She said it with a queer intensity.",
    "I said Hate doesnt last.",
    "Love does.",
    "Is that true\n\nIts what I believe.",
    "Again there was a silence.",
    "Then I said So its no is it\n\nYes its no.",
    "And you dont encourage me to hope\n\nWhat would be the good of that\n\n\fNone whatever I agreed.",
    "Quite redundant in fact  because Im\ngoing to hope whether you tell me to or not.",
    "Well that was that.",
    "I walked away from the house feeling slightly dazed but irritatingly\nconscious of Roses passionately interested gaze following me.",
    "Rose had had a good deal to say before I could escape.",
    "That shed\nnever felt the same since that awful day That she wouldnt have\nstayed except for the children and being sorry for poor Mr.\nSymmington.",
    "That she wasnt going to stay unless they got another\nmaid quick  and they wouldnt be likely to do that when there had\nbeen a murder in the house That it was all very well for that Miss\nHolland to say shed do the housework in the meantime.",
    "Very sweet and obliging she was  oh yes but it was mistress of the\nhouse that she was fancying herself going to be one fine day Mr.\nSymmington poor man never saw anything  but one knew what a\nwidower was a poor helpless creature made to be the prey of a\ndesigning woman.",
    "And that it wouldnt be for want of trying if Miss\nHolland didnt step into the dead mistresss shoes\n\nI assented mechanically to everything yearning to get away and\nunable to do so because Rose was holding firmly on to my hat while\nshe indulged in her flood of spite.",
    "I wondered if there was any truth in what she said.",
    "Had Elsie\nHolland envisaged the possibility of becoming the second Mrs.\nSymmington Or was she just a decent kindhearted girl doing her\nbest to look after a bereaved household\n\nThe result would quite likely be the same in either case.",
    "And why\nnot Symmingtons young children needed a mother  Elsie was a\ndecent soul  besides being quite indecently beautiful  a point\nwhich a man might appreciate  even such a stuffed fish as\nSymmington\n\nI thought all this I know because I was trying to put off thinking\nabout Megan.",
    "You may say that I had gone to ask Megan to marry me in an\nabsurdly complacent frame of mind and that I deserved what I got but it was not really like that.",
    "It was because I felt so assured so\ncertain that Megan belonged to me  that she was my business\nthat to look after her and make her happy and keep her from harm\nwas the only natural right way of life for me that I had expected her\nto feel too  that she and I belonged to each other.",
    "But I was not giving up.",
    "Oh no Megan was my woman and I was\ngoing to have her.",
    "After a moments thought I went to Symmingtons office.",
    "Megan\nmight pay no attention to strictures on her conduct but I would like\nto get things straight.",
    "Mr. Symmington was disengaged I was told and I was shown into\nthe room.",
    "By a pinching of the lips and an additional stiffness of manner I\ngathered that I was not exactly popular at the moment.",
    "Good morning I said.",
    "Im afraid this isnt a professional call but\na personal one.",
    "Ill put it plainly.",
    "I dare say youll have realized that\nIm in love with Megan.",
    "Ive asked her to marry me and she has\nrefused.",
    "But Im not taking that as final.",
    "I saw Symmingtons expression change and I read his mind with\nludicrous ease.",
    "Megan was a disharmonious element in his house.",
    "He was I felt sure a just and kindly man and he would never have\ndreamed of not providing a home for his dead wifes daughter.",
    "But\nher marriage to me would certainly be a relief.",
    "The frozen halibut\nthawed.",
    "He gave me a pale cautious smile.",
    "Frankly do you know Burton I had no idea of such a thing.",
    "I know\nyouve taken a lot of notice of her but weve always regarded her\nas such a child.",
    "Shes not a child I said shortly.",
    "No no not in years.",
    "She can be her age any time shes allowed to be I said still\nslightly angry.",
    "Shes not of age I know but she will be in a month\nor two.",
    "Ill let you have all the information about myself you want.",
    "Im well off and have led quite a decent life.",
    "Ill look after her and do\nall I can to make her happy.",
    "Quite  quite.",
    "Still its up to Megan herself.",
    "Shell come round in time I said.",
    "But I just thought Id like to get\nstraight with you about it.",
    "He said he appreciated that and we parted amicably.",
    "I ran into Miss Emily Barton outside.",
    "She had a shopping basket on\nher arm.",
    "Good morning Mr. Burton I hear you went to London yesterday.",
    "Yes she had heard all right.",
    "Her eyes were I thought kindly but\nfull of curiosity too.",
    "I went to see my doctor I said.",
    "Miss Emily smiled.",
    "That smile made little of Marcus Kent.",
    "She murmured I hear\nMegan nearly missed the train.",
    "She jumped in when it was going.",
    "Helped by me I said.",
    "I hauled her in.",
    "How very lucky you were there.",
    "Otherwise there might have been\nan accident.",
    "It is extraordinary how much of a fool one gentle inquisitive old\nmaiden lady can make a man feel\n\nI was saved further suffering by the onslaught of Mrs. Dane\nCalthrop.",
    "She had her own tame elderly maiden lady in tow but she\nherself was full of direct speech.",
    "Good morning she said.",
    "I hear youve made Megan buy herself\nsome decent clothes Very sensible of you.",
    "It takes a man to think\nof something really practical like that.",
    "Ive been worried about that\ngirl for a long time.",
    "Girls with brains are so liable to turn into\nmorons arent they\n\nWith which remarkable statement she shot into the fish shop.",
    "Miss Marple left standing by me twinkled a little and said Mrs.\nDane Calthrop is a very remarkable woman you know.",
    "Shes nearly\nalways right.",
    "It makes her rather alarming I said.",
    "Sincerity has that effect said Miss Marple.",
    "Mrs. Dane Calthrop shot out of the fish shop again and rejoined us.",
    "She was holding a large red lobster.",
    "Have you ever seen anything so unlike Mr. Pye she said.",
    "Very\nvirile and handsome isnt it\n\n\fI was a little nervous of meeting Joanna but I found when I got home\nthat I neednt have worried.",
    "She was out and she did not return for\nlunch.",
    "This aggrieved Partridge a good deal who said sourly as she\nproffered two loin chops in an entr\u0439e dish\n\nMiss Burton said specially as she was going to be in.",
    "I ate both chops in an attempt to atone for Joannas lapse.",
    "All the\nsame I wondered where my sister was.",
    "She had taken to being\nvery mysterious about her doings of late.",
    "It was half past three when Joanna burst into the drawing room.",
    "I\nhad heard a car stop outside and I half expected to see Griffith but\nthe car drove on and Joanna came in alone.",
    "Her face was very red and she seemed upset.",
    "I perceived that\nsomething had happened.",
    "Whats the matter I asked.",
    "Joanna opened her mouth closed it again sighed plumped herself\ndown in a chair and stared in front of her.",
    "She said Ive had the most awful day.",
    "Whats happened\n\nIve done the most incredible things.",
    "It was awful \n\nBut what \n\n\fI just started out for a walk an ordinary walk  I went up over the\nhill and on to the moor.",
    "I walked miles  I felt like it.",
    "Then I dropped\ndown into a hollow.",
    "Theres a farm there  a Godforsaken lonely\nsort of spot.",
    "I was thirsty and I wondered if they had any milk or\nsomething.",
    "So I wandered into the farmyard and then the door\nopened and Owen came out.",
    "Yes\n\nHe thought it might be the district nurse.",
    "There was a woman in\nthere having a baby.",
    "He was expecting the nurse and hed sent\nword to her to get hold of another doctor.",
    "It  things were going\nwrong.",
    "Yes\n\nSo he said  to me Come on youll do  better than nobody.",
    "I said I\ncouldnt and he said what did I mean I said Id never done\nanything like that that I didnt know anything \n\nHe asked me what the hell that mattered.",
    "And then he was awful.",
    "He turned on me.",
    "He said Youre a woman arent you I suppose\nyou can do your darnedest to help another woman And he went\non at me  said Id talked as though I was interested in doctoring\nand had said I wished I was a nurse.",
    "All pretty talk I suppose You\ndidnt mean anything real by it but this is real and youre going to\nbehave like a decent human being and not a useless ornamental\nnitwit\n\n\fIve done the most indiscernible things Jerry.",
    "Held instruments\nand boiled them and handed things.",
    "Im so tired I can hardly stand\nup.",
    "It was dreadful.",
    "But he saved her  and the baby.",
    "It was born\nalive.",
    "He didnt think at one time he could save it.",
    "Oh dear\n\nJoanna covered her face with her hands.",
    "I contemplated her with a certain amount of pleasure and mentally\ntook my hat off to Owen Griffith.",
    "Hed brought Joanna slap up\nagainst reality for once.",
    "I said Theres a letter for you in the hall.",
    "From Paul I think.",
    "Eh She paused for a minute and then said Id no idea Jerry\nwhat doctors had to do.",
    "The nerve theyve got to have\n\nI went out into the hall and brought Joanna her letter.",
    "She opened\nit glanced vaguely at its contents and let it drop.",
    "He was  really rather wonderful.",
    "The way he fought  the way he wouldnt be\nbeaten He was rude and horrible to me  but he was wonderful.",
    "I observed Pauls disregarded letter with some pleasure.",
    "Plainly\nJoanna was cured of Paul.",
    "Things never come when they are expected.",
    "I was full of Joannas and my personal affairs and was quite taken\naback the next morning when Nashs voice said over the telephone\n\n\fWeve got her Mr. Burton\n\nI was so startled I nearly dropped the receiver.",
    "You mean the \n\nHe interrupted Can you be overheard where you are\n\nNo I dont think so  well perhaps \n\nIt seemed to me that the baize door to the kitchen had swung open\na trifle.",
    "Perhaps youd care to come down to the station\n\nI will.",
    "Right away.",
    "I was at the police station in next to no time.",
    "In an inner room Nash\nand Sergeant Parkins were together.",
    "Nash was wreathed in smiles.",
    "Its been a long chase he said.",
    "But were there at last.",
    "He flicked a letter across the table.",
    "This time it was all typewritten.",
    "It was of its kind fairly mild\n\nIts no use thinking youre going to step into a dead womans\nshoes.",
    "The whole town is laughing at you.",
    "Get out now.",
    "Soon it will\nbe too late.",
    "This is a warning.",
    "Remember what happened to that\nother girl.",
    "Get out and stay out.",
    "It finished with some mildly obscene language.",
    "That reached Miss Holland this morning said Nash.",
    "Thought it was funny she hadnt had one before said Sergeant\nParkins.",
    "Who wrote it I asked.",
    "Some of the exultation faded out of Nashs face.",
    "He looked tired and concerned.",
    "He said soberly\n\nIm sorry about it because it will hit a decent man hard but there it\nis.",
    "Perhaps hes had his suspicions already.",
    "Who wrote it I reiterated.",
    "Miss Aim\u0439e Griffith.",
    "Nash and Parkins went to the Griffiths house that afternoon with a\nwarrant.",
    "By Nashs invitation I went with them.",
    "The doctor he said is very fond of you.",
    "He hasnt many friends\nin this place.",
    "I think if it is not too painful to you Mr. Burton that you\nmight help him to bear up under the shock.",
    "I said I would come.",
    "I didnt relish the job but I thought I might be\nsome good.",
    "We rang the bell and asked for Miss Griffith and we were shown into\nthe drawing room.",
    "Elsie Holland Megan and Symmington were\nthere having tea.",
    "Nash behaved very circumspectly.",
    "He asked Aim\u0439e if he might have a few words with her privately.",
    "She got up and came toward us.",
    "I thought I saw just a faint hunted\nlook in her eye.",
    "If so it went again.",
    "She was perfectly normal and\nhearty.",
    "Want me Not in trouble over my car lights again I hope\n\nShe led the way out of the drawing room and across the hall into a\nsmall study.",
    "As I closed the drawingroom door I saw Symmingtons head jerk\nup sharply.",
    "I supposed his legal training had brought him in contact\nwith police cases and he had recognized something in Nashs\nmanner.",
    "He half rose.",
    "That is all I saw before I shut the door and followed the others.",
    "Nash was saying his piece.",
    "He was very quiet and correct.",
    "He\ncautioned her and then told her that he must ask her to accompany\nhim.",
    "He had a warrant for her arrest and he read out the charge.",
    "I forget now the exact legal term.",
    "It was the letters not murder yet.",
    "Aim\u0439e Griffith flung up her head and bayed with laughter.",
    "She\nboomed out\n\nWhat ridiculous nonsense As though Id write a packet of indecent\nstuff like that.",
    "You must be mad.",
    "Ive never written a word of the\nkind.",
    "Nash had produced the letter to Elsie Holland.",
    "He said Do you\ndeny having written this Miss Griffith\n\nIf she hesitated it was only for a split second.",
    "Of course I do.",
    "Ive never seen it before.",
    "Nash said quietly\n\nI must tell you Miss Griffith that you were observed to type that\nletter on the machine at the Womens Institute between eleven and\neleventhirty P.M. on the night before last.",
    "Yesterday you entered\nthe post office with a bunch of letters in your hand.",
    "I never posted this.",
    "No you did not.",
    "While waiting for stamps you dropped it\ninconspicuously on the floor so that somebody should come along\nunsuspectingly and pick it up and post it.",
    "I never \n\nThe door opened and Symmington came in.",
    "He said sharply\n\nWhats going on Aim\u0439e if there is anything wrong you ought to\nbe legally represented.",
    "If you wish me \n\nShe broke then.",
    "Covered her face with her hands and staggered to\na chair.",
    "She said Go away Dick go away.",
    "Not you Not you\n\nYou need a solicitor my dear girl.",
    "Not you.",
    "I  I  couldnt bear it.",
    "I dont want you to know  all this.",
    "He understood then perhaps.",
    "He said quietly Ill get hold of\nMildmay of Exhampton.",
    "Will that do\n\nShe nodded.",
    "She was sobbing now.",
    "Symmington went out of the room.",
    "In the doorway he collided with\nOwen Griffith.",
    "Whats this said Owen violently.",
    "My sister \n\nIm sorry Dr. Griffith.",
    "Very sorry.",
    "But we have no alternative.",
    "You think she  was responsible for those letters\n\nIm afraid there is no doubt of it sir said Nash  he turned to\nAim\u0439e You must come with us now please Miss Griffith  you\nshall have every facility for seeing a solicitor you know.",
    "Owen cried Aim\u0439e\n\nShe brushed past him without looking at him.",
    "She said Dont talk to me.",
    "Dont say anything.",
    "And for heavens\nsake dont look at me\n\nThey went out.",
    "Owen stood like a man in a dream.",
    "I waited a bit then I came up to him.",
    "If theres anything I can do Griffith tell me.",
    "He said like a man in a dream Aim\u0439e I dont believe it.",
    "It may be a mistake I suggested feebly.",
    "He said slowly She wouldnt take it like that if it were.",
    "But I would\nnever have believed it.",
    "I cant believe it.",
    "He sank down on a chair.",
    "I made myself useful by finding a stiff\ndrink and bringing it to him.",
    "He swallowed it down and it seemed to\ndo him good.",
    "He said I couldnt take it in at first.",
    "Im all right now.",
    "Thanks\nBurton but theres nothing you can do.",
    "Nothing anyone can do.",
    "The door opened and Joanna came in.",
    "She was very white.",
    "She came over to Owen and looked at me.",
    "She said Get out Jerry.",
    "This is my business.",
    "As I went out of the door I saw her kneel down by his chair.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nI cant tell you coherently the events of the next twentyfour hours.",
    "Various incidents stand out unrelated to other incidents.",
    "I remember Joanna coming home very white and drawn and of how\nI tried to cheer her up saying\n\nNow whos being a ministering angel\n\nAnd of how she smiled in a pitiful twisted way and said He says he\nwont have me Jerry.",
    "Hes very very proud and stiff\n\nAnd I said My girl wont have me either... \n\nWe sat there for a while Joanna saying at last The Burton family\nisnt exactly in demand at the moment\n\n\fI said Never mind my sweet we still have each other and\nJoanna said Somehow or other Jerry that doesnt comfort me\nmuch just now... \n\nOwen came the next day and rhapsodized in the most fulsome way\nabout Joanna.",
    "She was wonderful marvelous\n\nThe way shed come to him the way she was willing to marry him at once if he liked.",
    "But he wasnt going to let her do that.",
    "No  she\nwas too good too fine to be associated with the kind of muck that\nwould start as soon as the papers got hold of the news.",
    "I was fond of Joanna and knew she was the kind whos all right\nwhen standing by in trouble but I got rather bored with all this\nhighfalutin stuff.",
    "I told Owen rather irritably not to be so damned\nnoble.",
    "I went down to the High Street and found everybodys tongue\nwagging nineteen to the dozen.",
    "Emily Barton was saying that she\nhad never really trusted Aim\u0439e Griffith.",
    "The grocers wife was\nsaying with gusto that shed always thought Miss Griffith had a\nqueer look in her eye.",
    "They had completed the case against Aim\u0439e so I learned from\nNash.",
    "A search of the house had brought to light the cut pages of\nEmily Bartons book  in the cupboard under the stairs of all places\nwrapped up in an old roll of wallpaper.",
    "And a jolly good place too said Nash appreciatively.",
    "You never\nknow when a prying servant wont tamper with a desk or a locked\ndrawer  but those junk cupboards full of last years tennis balls and\nold wallpaper are never opened except to shove something more\nin.",
    "The lady would seem to have had a penchant for that particular\nhiding place I said.",
    "Yes.",
    "The criminal mind seldom has much variety.",
    "By the way\ntalking of the dead girl weve got one fact to go upon Theres a\nlarge heavy pestle missing from the doctors dispensary.",
    "Ill bet\nanything you like thats what she was stunned with.",
    "Rather an awkward thing to carry about I objected.",
    "Not for Miss Griffith.",
    "She was going to the Guides that afternoon\nbut she was going to leave flowers and vegetables at the Red Cross\nstall on the way so shed got a whopping great basket with her.",
    "You havent found the skewer\n\nNo and I shant.",
    "The poor devil may be mad but she wasnt mad\nenough to keep a bloodstained skewer just to make it easy for us\nwhen all shed got to do was to wash it and return it to a kitchen\ndrawer.",
    "I suppose I conceded that you cant have everything.",
    "The vicarage had been one of the last places to hear the news.",
    "Old\nMiss Marple was very much distressed by it.",
    "She spoke to me very\nearnestly on the subject\n\nIt isnt true Mr. Burton.",
    "Im sure it isnt true.",
    "Its true enough Im afraid.",
    "They were lying in wait you know.",
    "They actually saw her type that letter.",
    "Yes yes  perhaps they did.",
    "Yes I can understand that.",
    "And the printed pages from which the letters were cut were found\nwhere shed hidden them in her house.",
    "Miss Marple stared at me.",
    "Then she said in a very low voice But\nthat is horrible  really wicked.",
    "Mrs. Dane Calthrop came up with a rush and joined us and said\nWhats the matter Jane\n\nMiss Marple was murmuring helplessly Oh dear oh dear what\ncan one do\n\nWhats upset you Jane\n\nMiss Marple said There must be something.",
    "But I am so old and so\nignorant and I am afraid so foolish.",
    "I felt rather embarrassed and was glad when Mrs. Dane Calthrop\ntook her friend away.",
    "I was to see Miss Marple again that afternoon however.",
    "Much later\nwhen I was on my way home.",
    "She was standing near the little bridge at the end of the village\nnear Mrs. Cleats cottage and talking to Megan of all people.",
    "I wanted to see Megan.",
    "I had been wanting to see her all day.",
    "I\nquickened my pace.",
    "But as I came up to them Megan turned on her\nheel and went off in the other direction.",
    "It made me angry and I would have followed her but Miss Marple\nblocked my way.",
    "I wanted to speak to you she said.",
    "No dont go after Megan\nnow.",
    "It wouldnt be wise.",
    "I was just going to make a sharp rejoinder when she disarmed me\nby saying That girl has great courage  a very high order of\ncourage.",
    "I still wanted to go after Megan but Miss Marple said Dont try and\nsee her now.",
    "I do know what I am talking about.",
    "She must keep her\ncourage intact.",
    "There was something about the old ladys assertion that chilled me.",
    "It was as though she knew something that I didnt.",
    "I was afraid and didnt know why I was afraid.",
    "I didnt go home.",
    "I went back into the High Street and walked up\nand down aimlessly.",
    "I dont know what I was waiting for nor what I\nwas thinking about...",
    "I got caught by that awful old bore Colonel Appleby.",
    "He asked after\nmy pretty sister as usual and then went on\n\nWhats all this about Griffiths sister being mad as a hatter They\nsay shes been at the bottom of this anonymous letter business\nthats been such a confounded nuisance to everybody Couldnt\nbelieve it at first but they say its quite true.",
    "I said it was true enough.",
    "Well well  I must say our police force is pretty good on the whole.",
    "Give em time thats all give em time.",
    "Funny business this\nanonymous letter stunt  these desiccated old women are always\nthe ones who go in for it  though the Griffith woman wasnt badlooking even if she was a bit long in the tooth.",
    "But there arent any\ndecentlooking girls in this part of the world  except that governess\ngirl of the Symmingtons.",
    "Shes worth looking at.",
    "Pleasant girl too.",
    "Grateful if one does any little thing for her.",
    "Came across her having a picnic or something with those kids not\nlong ago.",
    "They were romping about in the heather and she was\nknitting  ever so vexed shed run out of wool.",
    "Well I said like me\nto run you into Lymstock Ive got to call for a rod of mine there.",
    "I\nshant be more than ten minutes getting it then Ill run you back\nagain.",
    "She was a bit doubtful about leaving the boys.",
    "Theyll be all\nright I said.",
    "Whos to harm them Wasnt going to have the boys\n\n\falong no fear So I ran her in dropped her at the wool shop picked\nher up again later and that was that.",
    "Thanked me very prettily.",
    "Grateful and all that.",
    "Nice girl.",
    "I managed to get away from him.",
    "It was after that that I caught sight of Miss Marple for the third time.",
    "She was coming out of the police station.",
    "Where do ones fears come from Where do they shape\nthemselves Where do they hide before coming out into the open\n\nJust one short phrase.",
    "Heard and noted and never quite put aside\n\nTake me away  Its so awful being here  feeling so wicked...\n\nWhy had Megan said that What had she to feel wicked about\n\nThere could be nothing in Mrs. Symmingtons death to make Megan\nfeel wicked.",
    "Why had the child felt wicked Why Why\n\nCould it be because she felt responsible in any way Megan\nImpossible Megan couldnt have had anything to do with those\nletters  those foul obscene letters.",
    "Owen Griffith had known a case\nup north  a schoolgirl...\n\nWhat had Inspector Graves said\n\n\fSomething about an adolescent mind...\n\nInnocent middleaged ladies on operating tables babbled words\nthey hardly knew.",
    "Little boys chalking up things on walls.",
    "No no not Megan.",
    "Heredity Bad blood An unconscious inheritance of something\nabnormal Her misfortune not her fault a curse laid upon her by a\npast generation\n\nIm not the wife for you.",
    "Im better at hating than loving.",
    "Oh my Megan my little child.",
    "Not that Anything but that.",
    "And that\nold Tabby is after you she suspects.",
    "She says you have courage.",
    "Courage to do what\n\nIt was only a brainstorm.",
    "It passed.",
    "But I wanted to see Megan  I\nwanted to see her badly.",
    "At half past nine that night I left the house and went down to the\ntown and along to the Symmingtons.",
    "It was then that an entirely new idea came into my mind.",
    "The idea of\na woman whom nobody had considered for a moment.",
    "Or had Nash considered her\n\n\fWildly unlikely wildly improbable and I would have said up to today\nimpossible too.",
    "But that was not so.",
    "No not impossible.",
    "I redoubled my pace.",
    "Because it was now even more imperative\nthat I should see Megan straightaway.",
    "I passed through the Symmingtons gate and up to the house.",
    "It was\na dark overcast night.",
    "A little rain was beginning to fall.",
    "The\nvisibility was bad.",
    "I saw a line of light from one of the windows.",
    "The little morning\nroom\n\nI hesitated a moment or two then instead of going up to the front\ndoor I swerved and crept very quietly up to the window skirting a\nbig bush and keeping low.",
    "The light came from a chink in the curtains which were not quite\ndrawn.",
    "It was easy to look through and see.",
    "It was a strangely peaceful and domestic scene.",
    "Symmington in a\nbig armchair and Elsie Holland her head bent busily patching a\nboys torn shirt.",
    "I could hear as well as see for the window was open at the top.",
    "Elsie Holland was speaking\n\n\fBut I do think really Mr. Symmington that the boys are quite old\nenough to go to boarding school.",
    "Not that I shant hate leaving them\nbecause I shall.",
    "Im ever so fond of them both.",
    "Symmington said I think perhaps youre right about Brian Miss\nHolland.",
    "Ive decided that he shall start next term at Winhays  my\nold prep school.",
    "But Colin is a little young yet.",
    "Id prefer him to wait\nanother year.",
    "Well of course I see what you mean.",
    "And Colin is perhaps a little\nyoung for his age \n\nQuiet domestic talk  quiet domestic scene  and a golden head bent\nover needlework.",
    "Then the door opened and Megan came in.",
    "She stood very straight in the doorway and I was aware at once of\nsomething tense and strung up about her.",
    "The skin of her face was\ntight and drawn and her eyes bright and resolute.",
    "There was no\ndiffidence about her tonight and no childishness.",
    "She said addressing Symmington but giving him no title and I\nsuddenly reflected that I never had heard her call him anything.",
    "Did\nshe address him as father or as Dick or what\n\nI would like to speak to you please.",
    "Alone.",
    "Symmington looked surprised and I fancied not best pleased.",
    "He\nfrowned but Megan carried her point with a determination unusual\nin her.",
    "She turned to Elsie Holland and said Do you mind Elsie\n\nOh of course.",
    "Elsie Holland jumped up.",
    "She looked startled and a\nlittle flurried.",
    "She went to the door and Megan came farther in so that Elsie\npassed her.",
    "Just for a minute Elsie stood motionless in the doorway looking\nover her shoulder.",
    "Her lips were closed she stood quite still one hand stretched out\nthe other clasping her needlework to her.",
    "I caught my breath overwhelmed suddenly by her beauty.",
    "When I\nthink of her now I always think of her like that  in arrested motion\nwith that matchless deathless perfection that belonged to ancient\nGreece.",
    "Then she went out shutting the door.",
    "Symmington said rather fretfully Well Megan what is it What do\nyou want\n\nMegan had come right up to the table.",
    "She stood there looking\ndown at Symmington.",
    "I was struck anew by the resolute\n\n\fdetermination of her face and by something else  a hardness new\nto me.",
    "Then she opened her lips and said something that startled me to the\ncore.",
    "I want some money she said.",
    "The request didnt improve Symmingtons temper.",
    "He said sharply\nCouldnt you have waited until tomorrow morning Whats the\nmatter do you think your allowance is inadequate\n\nA fair man I thought even then open to reason though not to\nemotional appeal.",
    "Megan said I want a good deal of money.",
    "Symmington sat up straight in his chair.",
    "He said coldly\n\nYou will come of age in a few months time.",
    "Then the money left\nyou by your grandmother will be turned over to you by the Public\nTrustee.",
    "Megan said\n\nYou dont understand.",
    "I want money from you.",
    "She went on\nspeaking faster Nobodys ever talked much to me about my\nfather.",
    "Theyve not wanted me to know about him.",
    "But I do know\nthat he went to prison and I know why.",
    "It was for blackmail\n\n\fShe paused.",
    "Well Im his daughter.",
    "And perhaps I take after him.",
    "Anyway Im\nasking you to give me money because  if you dont  She stopped\nand then went on very slowly and evenly  if you dont  shall say\nwhat I saw you doing to the cachet that day in my mothers room.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Then Symmington said in a completely\nemotionless voice I dont know what you mean.",
    "Megan said I think you do.",
    "And she smiled.",
    "It was not a nice smile.",
    "Symmington got up.",
    "He went over to the writing desk.",
    "He took a\ncheckbook from his pocket and wrote out a check.",
    "He blotted it\ncarefully and then came back.",
    "He held it out to Megan.",
    "Youre grown up now he said.",
    "I can understand that you may\nfeel you want to buy something rather special in the way of clothes\nand all that.",
    "I dont know what youre talking about.",
    "I didnt pay\nattention.",
    "But heres a check.",
    "Megan looked at it then she said Thank you.",
    "That will do to go on\nwith.",
    "She turned and went out of the room.",
    "Symmington stared after her\nand at the closed door then he turned around and as I saw his face\nI made a quick uncontrolled movement forward.",
    "It was checked in\n\n\fthe most extraordinary fashion.",
    "The big bush that I had noticed by\nthe wall stopped being a bush.",
    "Superintendent Nashs arms went around me and Superintendent\nNashs voice just breathed in my ear\n\nQuiet Burton.",
    "For Gods sake.",
    "Then with infinite caution he beat a retreat his arm impelling me to\naccompany him.",
    "Around the side of the house he straightened himself and wiped his\nforehead.",
    "Of course he said.",
    "You would have to butt in\n\nThat girl isnt safe I said urgently.",
    "You saw his face Weve got\nto get her out of here.",
    "Nash took a firm grip of my arm.",
    "Now look here Mr. Burton youve got to listen.",
    "Well I listened.",
    "I didnt like it but I gave in.",
    "But I insisted on being on the spot and I swore to obey orders\nimplicitly.",
    "So that is how I came with Nash and Parkins into the house by the\nback door which was already unlocked.",
    "And I waited with Nash on the upstairs landing behind the velvet\ncurtain masking the window alcove until the clocks in the house\nstruck two and Symmingtons door opened and he went across the\nlanding and into Megans room.",
    "I did not stir or make a move for I knew that Sergeant Parkins was\ninside masked by the opening door and I knew that Parkins was a\ngood man and knew his job and I knew that I couldnt have trusted\nmyself to keep quiet and not break out.",
    "And waiting there with my heart thudding I saw Symmington come\nout with Megan in his arms and carry her downstairs with Nash and\nmyself a discreet distance behind him.",
    "He carried her through to the kitchen and he had just arranged her\ncomfortably with her head in the gas oven and had turned on the\ngas when Nash and I came through the kitchen door and switched\non the light.",
    "And that was the end of Richard Symmington.",
    "He collapsed.",
    "Even\nwhile I was hauling Megan out and turning off the gas I saw the\ncollapse.",
    "He didnt even try to fight.",
    "He knew hed played and lost.",
    "Upstairs I sat by Megans bed waiting for her to come around and\noccasionally cursing Nash.",
    "How do you know shes all right It was too big a risk.",
    "Nash was\nvery soothing.",
    "Just a soporific in the milk she always had by her bed.",
    "Nothing\nmore.",
    "It stands to reason he couldnt risk her being poisoned.",
    "As\nfar as hes concerned the whole business is closed with Miss\nGriffiths arrest.",
    "He cant afford to have any mysterious death.",
    "No\nviolence no poison.",
    "But if a rather unhappy type of girl broods over\nher mothers suicide and finally goes and puts her head in the gas\noven  well people just say that she was never quite normal and the\nshock of her mothers death finished her.",
    "I said watching Megan Shes a long time coming around.",
    "You heard what Dr. Griffith said Heart and pulse quite all right shell just sleep and wake naturally.",
    "Stuff he gives a lot of his\npatients he says.",
    "Megan stirred.",
    "She murmured something.",
    "Superintendent Nash unobtrusively left the room.",
    "Presently Megan opened her eyes.",
    "Jerry.",
    "Hullo sweet.",
    "Did I do it well\n\n\fYou might have been blackmailing ever since your cradle\n\nMegan closed her eyes again.",
    "Then she murmured\n\nLast night  I was writing to you  in case anything went  went\nwrong.",
    "But I was too sleepy to finish.",
    "Its over there.",
    "I went across to the writing table.",
    "In a shabby little blotter I found\nMegans unfinished letter.",
    "My dear Jerry it began primly\n\nI was reading my school Shakespeare and the sonnet that begins\n\nSo are you to my thoughts as food to life\n\nOr as sweetseasond showers are to the ground\n\nand I see that I am in love with you after all because that is what I\nfeel...",
    "So you see said Mrs. Dane Calthrop I was quite right to call in\nan expert.",
    "I stared at her.",
    "We were all at the vicarage.",
    "The rain was pouring\ndown outside and there was a pleasant log fire and Mrs. Dane\n\n\fCalthrop had just wandered around beat up a sofa cushion and put\nit for some reason of her own on the top of the grand piano.",
    "But did you I said surprised.",
    "Who was it What did he do\n\nIt wasnt a he said Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "With a sweeping gesture she indicated Miss Marple.",
    "Miss Marple\nhad finished the fleecy knitting and was now engaged with a\ncrochet hook and a ball of cotton.",
    "Thats my expert said Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "Jane Marple.",
    "Look at\nher well.",
    "I tell you that woman knows more about the different\nkinds of human wickedness than anyone Ive ever known.",
    "I dont think you should put it quite like that dear murmured Miss\nMarple.",
    "But you do.",
    "One sees a good deal of human nature living in a village all the\nyear around said Miss Marple placidly.",
    "Then seeming to feel it was expected of her she laid down her\ncrochet and delivered a gentle oldmaidish dissertation on murder.",
    "The great thing in these cases is to keep an absolutely open mind.",
    "Most crimes you see are so absurdly simple.",
    "This one was.",
    "Quite\nsane and straightforward  and quite understandable  in an\nunpleasant way of course.",
    "Very unpleasant\n\nThe truth was really so very obvious.",
    "You saw it you know Mr.\nBurton.",
    "Indeed I did not.",
    "But you did.",
    "You indicated the whole thing to me.",
    "You saw\nperfectly the relationship of one thing to the other but you just\nhadnt enough selfconfidence to see what those feelings of yours\nmeant.",
    "To begin with that tiresome phrase No smoke without fire.",
    "It irritated you but you proceeded quite correctly to label it for\nwhat it was  a smoke screen.",
    "Misdirection you see  everybody\nlooking at the wrong thing  the anonymous letters but the whole\npoint was that there werent any anonymous letters\n\nBut my dear Miss Marple I can assure you that there were.",
    "I had\none.",
    "Oh yes but they werent real at all.",
    "Dear Maud here tumbled on\nthat.",
    "Even in peaceful Lymstock there are plenty of scandals and I\ncan assure you any woman living in the place would have known\nabout them and used them.",
    "But a man you see isnt interested in\ngossip in the same way  especially a detached logical man like Mr.\nSymmington.",
    "But a genuine woman writer of those letters would\nhave made her letters much more to the point.",
    "So you see that if you disregard the smoke and come to the fire\nyou know where you are.",
    "You just come down to the actual facts of\n\n\fwhat happened.",
    "And putting aside the letters just one thing\nhappened  Mrs. Symmington died.",
    "So then naturally one thinks of who might have wanted Mrs.\nSymmington to die and of course the very first person one thinks of\nin such a case is I am afraid the husband.",
    "And one asks oneself is\nthere any reason  any motive  for instance any other woman\n\nAnd the very first thing I hear is that there is a very attractive\nyoung governess in the house.",
    "So clear isnt it Mr. Symmington a\nrather dry repressed unemotional man tied to a querulous and\nneurotic wife and then suddenly this radiant young creature comes\nalong.",
    "Im afraid you know that gentlemen when they fall in love at a\ncertain age get the disease very badly.",
    "Its quite a madness.",
    "And\nMr. Symmington as far as I can make out was never actually a\ngood man  he wasnt very kind or very affectionate or very\nsympathetic  his qualities were all negative  so he hadnt really the\nstrength to fight his madness.",
    "And in a place like this only his wifes\ndeath would solve his problem.",
    "He wanted to marry the girl you\nsee.",
    "Shes very respectable and so is he.",
    "And besides hes devoted\nto his children and didnt want to give them up.",
    "He wanted\neverything his home his children his respectability and Elsie.",
    "And\nthe price he would have to pay for that was murder.",
    "He chose I do think a very clever way.",
    "He knew so well from his\nexperience of criminal cases how soon suspicion falls on the\nhusband if a wife dies unexpectedly  and the possibility of\nexhumation in the case of poison.",
    "So he created a death which\n\n\fseemed only incidental to something else.",
    "He created a nonexistent\nanonymous letter writer.",
    "And the clever thing was that the police\nwere certain to suspect a woman  and they were quite right in a\nway.",
    "All the letters were a womans letters he copied them very\ncleverly from the letters in the case last year and from a case Dr.\nGriffith told him about.",
    "I dont mean that he was so crude as to\nreproduce\n\nany\n\nletter\n\nverbatim\n\nbut\n\nhe\n\ntook\n\nphrases\n\nand\n\nexpressions from them and mixed them up and the net result was\nthat the letters definitely represented a womans mind  a halfcrazy\nrepressed personality.",
    "He knew all the tricks that the police use handwriting typewriting\ntests etc.",
    "Hes been preparing his crime for some time.",
    "He typed all\nthe envelopes before he gave away the typewriter to the Womens\nInstitute and he cut the pages from the book at Little Furze\nprobably quite a long time ago when he was waiting in the drawing\nroom one day.",
    "People dont open books of sermons much\n\nAnd finally having got his false Poison Pen well established he\nstaged the real thing.",
    "A fine afternoon when the governess and the\nboys and his stepdaughter would be out and the Servants having\ntheir regular day out.",
    "He couldnt foresee that the little maid Agnes\nwould quarrel with her boyfriend and come back to the house.",
    "Joanna asked But what did she see Do you know that\n\nI dont know.",
    "I can only guess.",
    "My guess would be that she didnt\nsee anything.",
    "That it was all a mares nest\n\n\fNo my dear I mean that she stood at the pantry window all the\nafternoon waiting for the young man to come and make it up and\nthat quite literally she saw nothing.",
    "That is no one came to the\nhouse at all not the postman nor anybody else.",
    "It would take her some time being slow to realize that that was\nvery odd  because apparently Mrs. Symmington had received an\nanonymous letter that afternoon.",
    "Didnt she receive one I asked puzzled.",
    "But of course not As I say this crime is so simple.",
    "Her husband\njust put the cyanide in the top cachet of the ones she took in the\nafternoon when her sciatica came on after lunch.",
    "All Symmington\nhad to do was to get home before or at the same time as Elsie\nHolland call his wife get no answer go up to her room drop a spot\nof cyanide in the plain glass of water she had used to swallow the\ncachet toss the crumpledup anonymous letter into the grate and\nput by her hand the scrap of paper with I cant go on written on it.",
    "Miss Marple turned to me.",
    "You were quite right about that too Mr. Burton.",
    "A scrap of paper\nwas all wrong.",
    "People dont leave suicide notes on small torn\nscraps of paper.",
    "They use a sheet of paper  and very often an\nenvelope too.",
    "Yes the scrap of paper was wrong and you knew it.",
    "You are rating me too high I said.",
    "I knew nothing.",
    "But you did you really did Mr. Burton.",
    "Otherwise why were you\nimmediately impressed by the message your sister left scribbled on\nthe telephone pad\n\nI repeated slowly Say that I cant go on FridayI see I cant go\non\n\nMiss Marple beamed on me.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Mr. Symmington came across such a message and saw its\npossibilities.",
    "He tore off the words he wanted for when the time\ncame  a message genuinely in his wifes handwriting.",
    "Was there any further brilliance on my part I asked.",
    "Miss Marple twinkled at me.",
    "You put me on the track you know.",
    "You assembled those facts\ntogether for me  in sequence  and on top of it you told me the most\nimportant thing of all  that Elsie Holland had never received any\nanonymous letters.",
    "Do you know I said last night I thought that she was the letter\nwriter and that that was why there had been no letters written to\nher\n\nOh dear me no...",
    "The person who writes anonymous letters\npractically always sends them to herself as well.",
    "Thats part of the well the excitement I suppose.",
    "No no the fact interested me for\nquite another reason.",
    "It was really you see Mr. Symmingtons one\n\n\fweakness.",
    "He couldnt bring himself to write a foul letter to the girl\nhe loved.",
    "Its a very interesting sidelight on human nature  and a\ncredit to him in a way  but its where he gave himself away.",
    "Joanna said And he killed Agnes But surely that was quite\nunnecessary\n\nPerhaps it was but what you dont realize my dear not having\nkilled anyone is that your judgement is distorted afterward and\neverything seems exaggerated.",
    "No doubt he heard the girl\ntelephoning to Partridge saying shed been worried ever since Mrs.\nSymmingtons death that there\n\nwas something she\n\ndidnt\n\nunderstand.",
    "He cant take any chances  this stupid foolish girl has\nseen something knows something.",
    "Yet apparently he was at his office all that afternoon\n\nI should imagine he killed her before he went.",
    "Miss Holland was in\nthe dining room and kitchen.",
    "He just went out into the hall opened\nand shut the front door as though he was going out then slipped\ninto the little cloakroom.",
    "When only Agnes was left in the house he probably rang the\nfrontdoor bell slipped back into the cloakroom came out behind\nher and hit her on the head as she was opening the front door and\nthen after thrusting the body into the cupboard he hurried along to\nhis office arriving just a little late if anyone had happened to notice\nit but they probably didnt.",
    "You see no one was suspecting a man.",
    "Abominable brute said Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "Youre not sorry for him Mrs. Dane Calthrop I inquired.",
    "Not in the least.",
    "Why\n\nIm glad to hear it thats all.",
    "Joanna said\n\nBut why Aim\u0439e Griffith I know that the police have found the\npestle taken from Owens dispensary  and the skewer too.",
    "I\nsuppose its not so easy for a man to return things to kitchen\ndrawers.",
    "And guess where they were Superintendent Nash only\ntold me just now when I met him on my way here.",
    "In one of those\nmusty old deed boxes in his office.",
    "Estate of Sir Jasper HarringtonWest deceased.",
    "Poor Jasper said Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "He was a cousin of mine.",
    "So a correct old boy.",
    "He would have had a fit\n\nWasnt it madness to keep them I asked.",
    "Probably madder to throw them away said Mrs. Dane Calthrop.",
    "No one had any suspicions about Symmington.",
    "He didnt strike her with the pestle said Joanna.",
    "There was a\nclock weight there too with hair and blood on it.",
    "He pinched the\npestle the thing on the day Aim\u0439e was arrested and hid the book\npages in her house.",
    "And that brings me back to my original\n\n\fquestion.",
    "What about Aim\u0439e Griffith The police actually saw her\nwrite that letter.",
    "Yes of course said Miss Marple.",
    "She did write that letter.",
    "But why\n\nOh my dear surely you have realized that Miss Griffith had been\nin love with Symmington all her life\n\nPoor thing said Mrs. Dane Calthrop mechanically.",
    "Theyd always\nbeen good friends and I daresay she thought after Mrs.\nSymmingtons death that someday perhaps  well \n\nMiss Marple coughed delicately.",
    "And then the gossip began\nspreading about Elsie Holland and I expect that upset her badly.",
    "She thought of the girl as a designing minx worming her way into\nSymmingtons affections and quite unworthy of him.",
    "And so I think\nshe succumbed to temptation.",
    "Why not add one more anonymous\nletter and frighten the girl out of the race It must have seemed\nquite safe to her and she took as she thought every precaution.",
    "Well said Joanna.",
    "Finish the story.",
    "I should imagine said Miss Marple slowly that when Miss\nHolland showed that letter to Symmington he realized at once who\nhad written it and he saw a chance to finish the case once and for\nall and make himself safe.",
    "Not very nice  no not very nice but he\nwas frightened you see.",
    "The police wouldnt be satisfied until\ntheyd got the anonymous letter writer.",
    "When he took the letter\n\n\fdown to the police and he found theyd actually seen Aim\u0439e writing\nit he felt hed got a chance in a thousand of finishing the whole\nthing.",
    "He took the family to tea there that afternoon and as he came from\nthe office with his attache case he could easily bring the tornout\nbook pages to hide under the stairs and clinch the case.",
    "Hiding\nthem under the stairs was a neat touch.",
    "It recalled the disposal of\nAgnes body and from the practical point of view it was very easy\nfor him.",
    "When he followed Aim\u0439e and the police just a minute or\ntwo in the hall passing through would be enough.",
    "All the same I said theres one thing I cant forgive you for Miss\nMarple  roping in Megan.",
    "Miss Marple put down her crochet which she had resumed.",
    "She looked at me over her spectacles and her eyes were stern.",
    "My dear young man something had to be done.",
    "There was no\nevidence against this very clever and unscrupulous man.",
    "I needed\nsomeone to help me someone of high courage and good brains.",
    "I\nfound the person I needed.",
    "It was very dangerous for her.",
    "Yes it was dangerous but we are not put into this world Mr.\nBurton to avoid danger when an innocent fellow creatures life is at\nstake.",
    "You understand me\n\n\fI understood.",
    "It was morning in the High Street.",
    "Miss Emily Barton came out of the grocers with her shopping bag.",
    "Her cheeks were pink and her eyes were excited.",
    "Oh dear Mr. Burton I really am in such a flutter.",
    "To think I really\nam going on a cruise at last\n\nI hope youll enjoy it.",
    "Oh Im sure I shall.",
    "I should never have dared to go by myself.",
    "It\ndoes seem so providential the way everything has turned out.",
    "For a\nlong time Ive felt that I ought to part with Little Furze that my\nmeans were really too straitened but I couldnt bear the idea of\nstrangers there.",
    "But now that you have bought it and are going to live there with\nMegan  it is quite different.",
    "And then dear Aim\u0439e after her terrible\nordeal not quite knowing what to do with herself and her brother\ngetting married how nice to think you have both settled down with\nus and agreeing to come with me.",
    "We mean to be away quite a\nlong time.",
    "We might even  Miss Emily dropped her voice  go\naround the world And Aim\u0439e is so splendid and so practical.",
    "I\nreally do think  dont you  that everything turns out for the best.",
    "Just for a fleeting moment I thought of Mrs. Symmington and Agnes\nWoddell in their graves in the churchyard and wondered if they\n\n\fwould agree and then I remembered that Agnes boyfriend hadnt\nbeen very fond of her and that Mrs. Symmington hadnt been very\nnice to Megan and what the hell Weve all got to die sometime\nAnd I agreed with happy Miss Emily that everything was for the best\nin the best of possible worlds.",
    "I went along the High Street and in at the Symmingtons gate and\nMegan came out to meet me.",
    "It was not a romantic meeting because an outsize old english\nsheep dog came out with Megan and nearly knocked me over with\nhis illtimed exuberance.",
    "Isnt he adorable said Megan.",
    "A little overwhelming.",
    "Is he ours\n\nYes hes a wedding present from Joanna.",
    "We have had nice\nwedding presents havent we That fluffy woolly thing that we dont\nknow what its for from Miss Marple and the lovely Crown Derby tea\nset from Mr. Pye and Elsie has sent me a toast rack\n\nHow typical I interjected.",
    "And shes got a post with a dentist and is very happy.",
    "And  where\nwas I\n\nEnumerating wedding presents.",
    "Dont forget if you change your\nmind youll have to send them all back.",
    "I shant change my mind.",
    "What else have we got Oh yes Mrs.\nDane Calthrop has sent an Egyptian scarab.",
    "Original woman I said.",
    "Oh Oh But you dont know the best.",
    "Partridge has actually sent\nme a present.",
    "Its the most hideous tea cloth youve ever seen.",
    "But I\nthink she must like me now because she says she embroidered it all\nwith her own hands.",
    "In a design of sour grapes and thistles I suppose\n\nNo true lovers knots.",
    "Dear dear I said Partridge is coming on.",
    "Megan had dragged me into the house.",
    "She said\n\nTheres just one thing I cant make out.",
    "Besides the dogs own\ncollar and lead Joanna has sent an extra collar and lead.",
    "What do\nyou think thats for\n\nThat I said is Joannas little joke."
