    "The Clocks\nAgatha Christie\n1963\n\n\fTo my old friend Mario\nwith happy memories of delicious food\nat the Caprice.",
    "2\n\n\fPrologue\nThe afternoon of the 9th of September was exactly like any other afternoon.",
    "None of\nthose who were to be concerned in the events of that day could lay claim to having had a\npremonition of disaster.",
    "With the exception that is of Mrs Packer of 47 Wilbraham\nCrescent who specialized in premonitions and who always described at great length\nafterwards the peculiar forebodings and tremors that had beset her.",
    "But Mrs Packer at\nNo.",
    "47 was so far away from No.",
    "19 and so little concerned with the happenings there\nthat it seemed unnecessary for her to have had a premonition at all.",
    "At the Cavendish Secretarial and Typewriting Bureau Principal Miss K. Martindale\nSeptember 9th had been a dull day a day of routine.",
    "The telephone rang typewriters\nclicked the pressure of business was average neither above nor below its usual volume.",
    "None of it was particularly interesting.",
    "Up till 2.35 September 9th might have been a day\nlike any other day.",
    "At 2.35 Miss Martindale\u2019s buzzer went and Edna Brent in the outer office answered it in\nher usual breathy and slightly nasal voice as she manoeuvred a toffee along the line of her\njaw.",
    "\u2018Yes Miss Martindale\u2019\n\u2018Now Edna\u2014that is not the way I\u2019ve told you to speak when answering the telephone.",
    "Enunciate clearly and keep your breath behind your tone.\u2019\n\u2018Sorry Miss Martindale.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s better.",
    "You can do it when you try.",
    "Send Sheila Webb in to me.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s not back from lunch yet Miss Martindale.\u2019\n\u2018Ah.\u2019 Miss Martindale\u2019s eye consulted the clock on her desk.",
    "2.36.",
    "Exactly six minutes late.",
    "Sheila Webb had been getting slack lately.",
    "\u2018Send her in when she comes.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Miss Martindale.\u2019\nEdna restored the toffee to the centre of her tongue and sucking pleasurably resumed\nher typing of Naked Love by Armand Levine.",
    "Its painstaking eroticism left her\nuninterested\u2014as indeed it did most of Mr Levine\u2019s readers in spite of his efforts.",
    "He was a\nnotable example of the fact that nothing can be duller than dull pornography.",
    "In spite of\nlurid jackets and provocative titles his sales went down every year and his last typing bill\nhad already been sent in three times.",
    "The door opened and Sheila Webb came in slightly out of breath.",
    "\u2018Sandy Cat\u2019s asking for you\u2019 said Edna.",
    "Sheila Webb made a face.",
    "3\n\n\f\u2018Just my luck\u2014on the one day I\u2019m late back\u2019\nShe smoothed down her hair picked up pad and pencil and knocked at the Principal\u2019s\ndoor.",
    "Miss Martindale looked up from her desk.",
    "She was a woman of forty\u2010odd bristling with\nefficiency.",
    "Her pompadour of pale reddish hair and her Christian name of Katherine had\nled to her nickname of Sandy Cat.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re late back Miss Webb.\u2019\n\u2018Sorry Miss Martindale.",
    "There was a terrific bus jam.\u2019\n\u2018There is always a terrific bus jam at this time of day.",
    "You should allow for it.\u2019 She referred\nto a note on her pad.",
    "\u2018A Miss Pebmarsh rang up.",
    "She wants a stenographer at three\no\u2019clock.",
    "She asked for you particularly.",
    "Have you worked for her before\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t remember doing so Miss Martindale.",
    "Not lately anyway.\u2019\n\u2018The address is 19 Wilbraham Crescent.\u2019 She paused questioningly but Sheila Webb shook\nher head.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t remember going there.\u2019\nMiss Martindale glanced at the clock.",
    "\u2018Three o\u2019clock.",
    "You can manage that easily.",
    "Have you any other appointments this\nafternoon Ah yes\u2019 her eye ran down the appointment book at her elbow.",
    "\u2018Professor\nPurdy at the Curlew Hotel.",
    "Five o\u2019clock.",
    "You ought to be back before then.",
    "If not I can\nsend Janet.\u2019\nShe gave a nod of dismissal and Sheila went back to the outer office.",
    "\u2018Anything interesting Sheila\u2019\n\u2018Just another of those dull days.",
    "Some old pussy up at Wilbraham Crescent.",
    "And at five\nProfessor Purdy\u2014all those awful archaeological names How I wish something exciting\ncould sometimes happen.\u2019\nMiss Martindale\u2019s door opened.",
    "\u2018I see I have a memo here Sheila.",
    "If Miss Pebmarsh is not back when you arrive you are to\ngo in the door will not be latched.",
    "Go in and go into the room on the right of the hall and\nwait.",
    "Can you remember that or shall I write it down\u2019\n\u2018I can remember it Miss Martindale.\u2019\nMiss Martindale went back into her sanctum.",
    "4\n\n\fEdna Brent fished under her chair and brought up secretly a rather flashy shoe and a\nstiletto heel that had become detached from it.",
    "\u2018However am I going to get home\u2019 she moaned.",
    "\u2018Oh do stop fussing\u2014we\u2019ll think of something\u2019 said one of the other girls and resumed\nher typing.",
    "Edna sighed and put in a fresh sheet of paper \u2018Desire had him in its grasp.",
    "With frenzied\nfingers he tore the fragile chiffon from her breasts and forced her down on the soap.\u2019\n\u2018Damn\u2019 said Edna and reached for the eraser.",
    "Sheila picked up her handbag and went out.",
    "Wilbraham Crescent was a fantasy executed by a Victorian builder in the 1880\u2019s.",
    "It was a\nhalf\u2010moon of double houses and gardens set back to back.",
    "This conceit was a source of\nconsiderable difficulty to persons unacquainted with the locality.",
    "Those who arrived on\nthe outer side were unable to find the lower numbers and those who hit the inner side\nfirst were baffled as to the whereabouts of the higher numbers.",
    "The houses were neat\nprim artistically balconied and eminently respectable.",
    "Modernization had as yet barely\ntouched them\u2014on the outside that is to say.",
    "Kitchens and bathrooms were the first to\nfeel the wind of change.",
    "There was nothing unusual about No.",
    "19.",
    "It had neat curtains and a well\u2010polished brass\nfront\u2010door handle.",
    "There were standard rose trees each side of the path leading to the\nfront door.",
    "Sheila Webb opened the front gate walked up to the front door and rang the bell.",
    "There\nwas no response and after waiting a minute or two she did as she had been directed and\nturned the handle.",
    "The door opened and she walked in.",
    "The door on the right of the small\nhall was ajar.",
    "She tapped on it waited and then walked in.",
    "It was an ordinary quite\npleasant sitting\u2010room a little over\u2010furnished for modern tastes.",
    "The only thing at all\nremarkable about it was the profusion of clocks\u2014a grandfather clock ticking in the corner\na Dresden china clock on the mantelpiece a silver carriage clock on the desk a small fancy\ngilt clock on a whatnot near the fireplace and on a table by the window a faded leather\ntravelling clock with ROSEMARY in worn gilt letters across the corner.",
    "Sheila Webb looked at the clock on the desk with some surprise.",
    "It showed the time to be\na little after ten minutes past four.",
    "Her gaze shifted to the chimney piece.",
    "The clock there\nsaid the same.",
    "Sheila started violently as there was a whir and a click above her head and from a wooden\ncarved clock on the wall a cuckoo sprang out through his little door and announced loudly\nand definitely Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo The harsh note seemed almost menacing.",
    "The\ncuckoo disappeared again with a snap of his door.",
    "5\n\n\fSheila Webb gave a half\u2010smile and walked round the end of the sofa.",
    "Then she stopped\nshort pulling up with a jerk.",
    "Sprawled on the floor was the body of a man.",
    "His eyes were half open and sightless.",
    "There\nwas a dark moist patch on the front of his dark grey suit.",
    "Almost mechanically Sheila bent\ndown.",
    "She touched his cheek\u2014cold\u2014his hand the same... touched the wet patch and\ndrew her hand away sharply staring at it in horror.",
    "At that moment she heard the click of a gate outside her head turned mechanically to the\nwindow.",
    "Through it she saw a woman\u2019s figure hurrying up the path.",
    "Sheila swallowed\nmechanically\u2014her throat was dry.",
    "She stood rooted to the spot unable to move to cry\nout... staring in front of her.",
    "The door opened and a tall elderly woman entered carrying a shopping bag.",
    "She had wavy\ngrey hair pulled back from her forehead and her eyes were a wide and beautiful blue.",
    "Their gaze passed unseeingly over Sheila.",
    "Sheila uttered a faint sound no more than a croak.",
    "The wide blue eyes came to her and\nthe woman spoke sharply \u2018Is somebody there\u2019\n\u2018I\u2014it\u2019s\u2014\u2019 The girl broke off as the woman came swiftly towards her round the back of the\nsofa.",
    "And then she screamed.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t... you\u2019ll tread on it\u2014him... And he\u2019s dead...\u2019\n\n6\n\n\fChapter 1\nColin Lamb\u2019s Narrative\nI\nTo use police terms at 2.59 p.m. on September 9th I was proceeding along Wilbraham\nCrescent in a westerly direction.",
    "It was my first introduction to Wilbraham Crescent and\nfrankly Wilbraham Crescent had me baffled.",
    "I had been following a hunch with a persistence becoming more dogged day by day as the\nhunch seemed less and less likely to pay off.",
    "I\u2019m like that.",
    "The number I wanted was 61 and could I find it No I could not.",
    "Having studiously\nfollowed the numbers from 1 to 35 Wilbraham Crescent then appeared to end.",
    "A\nthoroughfare uncompromisingly labelled Albany Road barred my way.",
    "I turned back.",
    "On\nthe north side there were no houses only a wall.",
    "Behind the wall blocks of modern flats\nsoared upwards the entrance of them being obviously in another road.",
    "No help there.",
    "I looked up at the numbers I was passing.",
    "24 23 22 21.",
    "Diana Lodge presumably 20 with\nan orange cat on the gate post washing its face 19\u2014\nThe door of 19 opened and a girl came out of it and down the path with what seemed to\nbe the speed of a bomb.",
    "The likeness to a bomb was intensified by the screaming that\naccompanied her progress.",
    "It was high and thin and singularly inhuman.",
    "Through the gate\nthe girl came and collided with me with a force that nearly knocked me off the pavement.",
    "She did not only collide.",
    "She clutched\u2014a frenzied desperate clutching.",
    "\u2018Steady\u2019 I said as I recovered my balance.",
    "I shook her slightly.",
    "\u2018Steady now.\u2019\nThe girl steadied.",
    "She still clutched but she stopped screaming.",
    "Instead she gasped\u2014deep\nsobbing gasps.",
    "I can\u2019t say that I reacted to the situation with any brilliance.",
    "I asked her if anything was the\nmatter.",
    "Recognizing that my question was singularly feeble I amended it.",
    "\u2018What\u2019s the matter\u2019\nThe girl took a deep breath.",
    "\u2018In there\u2019 she gestured behind her.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s a man on the floor... dead... She was going to step on him.\u2019\n\u2018Who was Why\u2019\n7\n\n\f\u2018I think\u2014because she\u2019s blind.",
    "And there\u2019s blood on him.\u2019 She looked down and loosened\none of her clutching hands.",
    "\u2018And on me.",
    "There\u2019s blood on me.\u2019\n\u2018So there is\u2019 I said.",
    "I looked at the stains on my coat sleeve.",
    "\u2018And on me as well now\u2019 I\npointed out.",
    "I sighed and considered the situation.",
    "\u2018You\u2019d better take me in and show me\u2019\nI said.",
    "But she began to shake violently.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t...",
    "I won\u2019t go in there again.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps you\u2019re right.\u2019 I looked round.",
    "There seemed nowhere very suitable to deposit a\nhalf\u2010fainting girl.",
    "I lowered her gently to the pavement and sat her with her back against\nthe iron railings.",
    "\u2018You stay there\u2019 I said \u2018until I come back.",
    "I shan\u2019t be long.",
    "You\u2019ll be all right.",
    "Lean forward\nand put your head between your knees if you feel queer.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2014I think I\u2019m all right now.\u2019\nShe was a little doubtful about it but I didn\u2019t want to parley.",
    "I gave her a reassuring pat on\nthe shoulder and strode off briskly up the path.",
    "I went in through the door hesitated a\nmoment in the hallway looked into the door on the left found an empty dining\u2010room\ncrossed the hall and entered the sitting\u2010room opposite.",
    "The first thing I saw was an elderly woman with grey hair sitting in a chair.",
    "She turned her\nhead sharply as I entered and said \u2018Who\u2019s that\u2019\nI realized at once that the woman was blind.",
    "Her eyes which looked directly towards me\nwere focused on a spot behind my left car.",
    "I spoke abruptly and to the point.",
    "\u2018A young woman rushed out into the street saying there was a dead man in here.\u2019\nI felt a sense of absurdity as I said the words.",
    "It did not seem possible that there should be\na dead man in this tidy room with this calm woman sitting in her chair with her hands\nfolded.",
    "But her answer came at once.",
    "\u2018Behind the sofa\u2019 she said.",
    "I moved round the angle of the sofa.",
    "I saw it then\u2014the outflung arms\u2014the glazed eyes\u2014\nthe congealing patch of blood.",
    "\u2018How did this happen\u2019 I asked abruptly.",
    "8\n\n\f\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\u2018But\u2014surely.",
    "Who is he\u2019\n\u2018I have no idea.\u2019\n\u2018We must get the police.\u2019 I looked round.",
    "\u2018Where\u2019s the telephone\u2019\n\u2018I have not got a telephone.\u2019\nI concentrated upon her more closely.",
    "\u2018You live here This is your house\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Can you tell me what happened\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.",
    "I came in from shopping\u2014\u2019 I noted the shopping bag flung on a chair near the\ndoor.",
    "\u2018I came in here.",
    "I realized at once there was someone in the room.",
    "One does very\neasily when one is blind.",
    "I asked who was there.",
    "There was no answer\u2014only the sound of\nsomeone breathing rather quickly.",
    "I went towards the sound\u2014and then whoever it was\ncried out\u2014something about someone being dead and that I was going to tread on him.",
    "And then whoever it was rushed past me out of the room screaming.\u2019\nI nodded.",
    "Their stories clicked.",
    "\u2018And what did you do\u2019\n\u2018I felt my way very carefully until my foot touched an obstacle.\u2019\n\u2018And then\u2019\n\u2018I knelt down.",
    "I touched something\u2014a man\u2019s hand.",
    "It was cold\u2014there was no pulse...",
    "I got\nup and came over here and sat down\u2014to wait.",
    "Someone was bound to come in due\ncourse.",
    "The young woman whoever she was would give the alarm.",
    "I thought I had better\nnot leave the house.\u2019\nI was impressed with the calm of this woman.",
    "She had not screamed or stumbled panic\u2010\nstricken from the house.",
    "She had sat down calmly to wait.",
    "It was the sensible thing to do\nbut it must have taken some doing.",
    "Her voice inquired \u2018Who exactly are you\u2019\n\u2018My name is Colin Lamb.",
    "I happened to be passing by.\u2019\n\u2018Where is the young woman\u2019\n9\n\n\f\u2018I left her propped up by the gate.",
    "She\u2019s suffering from shock.",
    "Where is the nearest\ntelephone\u2019\n\u2018There is a call\u2010box about fifty yards down the road just before you come to the corner.\u2019\n\u2018Of course.",
    "I remember passing it.",
    "I\u2019ll go and ring the police.",
    "Will you\u2014\u2019 I hesitated.",
    "I didn\u2019t know whether to say \u2018Will you remain here\u2019 or to make it \u2018Will you be all right\u2019\nShe relieved me from my choice.",
    "\u2018You had better bring the girl into the house\u2019 she said decisively.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know that she will come\u2019 I said doubtfully.",
    "\u2018Not into this room naturally.",
    "Put her in the dining\u2010room the other side of the hall.",
    "Tell her\nI am making some tea.\u2019\nShe rose and came towards me.",
    "\u2018But\u2014can you manage\u2014\u2019\nA faint grim smile showed for a moment on her face.",
    "\u2018My dear young man.",
    "I have made meals for myself in my own kitchen ever since I came to\nlive in this house\u2014fourteen years ago.",
    "To be blind is not necessarily to be helpless.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry.",
    "It was stupid of me.",
    "Perhaps I ought to know your name\u2019\n\u2018Millicent Pebmarsh\u2014Miss.\u2019\nI went out and down the path.",
    "The girl looked up at me and began to struggle to her feet.",
    "\u2018I\u2014I think I\u2019m more or less all right now.\u2019\nI helped her up saying cheerfully \u2018Good.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2014there was a dead man in there wasn\u2019t there\u2019\nI agreed promptly.",
    "\u2018Certainly there was.",
    "I\u2019m just going down to the telephone box to report it to the police.",
    "I\nshould wait in the house if I were you.\u2019 I raised my voice to cover her quick protest.",
    "\u2018Go\ninto the dining\u2010room\u2014on the left as you go in.",
    "Miss Pebmarsh is making a cup of tea for\nyou.\u2019\n\u2018So that was Miss Pebmarsh And she\u2019s blind\u2019\n10\n\n\f\u2018Yes.",
    "It\u2019s been a shock to her too of course but she\u2019s being very sensible.",
    "Come on I\u2019ll\ntake you in.",
    "A cup of tea will do you good whilst you are waiting for the police to come.\u2019\nI put an arm round her shoulders and urged her up the path.",
    "I settled her comfortably by\nthe dining\u2010room table and hurried off again to telephone.",
    "II\nAn unemotional voice said \u2018Crowdean Police Station.\u2019\n\u2018Can I speak to Detective Inspector Hardcastle\u2019\nThe voice said cautiously \u2018I don\u2019t know whether he is here.",
    "Who is speaking\u2019\n\u2018Tell him it\u2019s Colin Lamb.\u2019\n\u2018Just a moment please.\u2019\nI waited.",
    "Then Dick Hardcastle\u2019s voice spoke.",
    "\u2018Colin I didn\u2019t expect you yet awhile.",
    "Where are you\u2019\n\u2018Crowdean.",
    "I\u2019m actually in Wilbraham Crescent.",
    "There\u2019s a man lying dead on the floor of\nNumber 19 stabbed I should think.",
    "He\u2019s been dead approximately half an hour or so.\u2019\n\u2018Who found him.",
    "You\u2019\n\u2018No I was an innocent passer\u2010by.",
    "Suddenly a girl came flying out of the house like a bat\nout of hell.",
    "Nearly knocked me down.",
    "She said there was a dead man on the floor and a\nblind woman was trampling on him.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re not having me on are you\u2019 Dick\u2019s voice asked suspiciously.",
    "\u2018It does sound fantastic I admit.",
    "But the facts seem to be as stated.",
    "The blind woman is\nMiss Millicent Pebmarsh who owns the house.\u2019\n\u2018And was she trampling on the dead man\u2019\n\u2018Not in the sense you mean it.",
    "It seems that being blind she just didn\u2019t know he was there.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll set the machinery in motion.",
    "Wait for me there.",
    "What have you done with the girl\u2019\n\u2018Miss Pebmarsh is making her a cup of tea.\u2019\nDick\u2019s comment was that it all sounded very cosy.",
    "11\n\n\f12\n\n\fChapter 2\nAt 19 Wilbraham Crescent the machinery of the Law was in possession.",
    "There was a\npolice surgeon a police photographer fingerprint men.",
    "They moved efficiently each\noccupied with his own routine.",
    "Finally came Detective Inspector Hardcastle a tall poker\u2010faced man with expressive\neyebrows godlike to see that all he had put in motion was being done and done\nproperly.",
    "He took a final look at the body exchanged a few brief words with the police\nsurgeon and then crossed to the dining\u2010room where three people sat over empty tea\u2010\ncups.",
    "Miss Pebmarsh Colin Lamb and a tall girl with brown curling hair and wide\nfrightened eyes.",
    "\u2018Quite pretty\u2019 the inspector noted parenthetically as it were.",
    "He introduced himself to Miss Pebmarsh.",
    "\u2018Detective Inspector Hardcastle.\u2019\nHe knew a little about Miss Pebmarsh though their paths had never crossed\nprofessionally.",
    "But he had seen her about and he was aware that she was an ex\u2010school\nteacher and that she had a job connected with the teaching of Braille at the Aaronberg\nInstitute for handicapped children.",
    "It seemed wildly unlikely that a man should be found\nmurdered in her neat austere house\u2014but the unlikely happened more often than one\nwould be disposed to believe.",
    "\u2018This is a terrible thing to have happened Miss Pebmarsh\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m afraid it must have\nbeen a great shock to you.",
    "I\u2019ll need to get a clear statement of exactly what occurred from\nyou all.",
    "I understand that it was Miss\u2014\u2019 he glanced quickly at the note\u2010book the constable\nhad handed him \u2018Sheila Webb who actually discovered the body.",
    "If you\u2019ll allow me to use\nyour kitchen Miss Pebmarsh I\u2019ll take Miss Webb in there where we can be quiet.\u2019\nHe opened the connecting door from the dining\u2010room to the kitchen and waited until the\ngirl had passed through.",
    "A young plain\u2010clothes detective was already established in the\nkitchen writing unobtrusively at a Formica\u2010topped small table.",
    "\u2018This chair looks comfortable\u2019 said Hardcastle pulling forward a modernized version of a\nWindsor chair.",
    "Sheila Webb sat down nervously staring at him with large frightened eyes.",

    "Her name is Mrs Curtin.\u2019\nDetective Inspector Hardcastle was taken aback.",
    "There was a positive assurance a\nbriskness in Miss Pebmarsh\u2019s tone that carried conviction.",

    "When I\nsay I would like to see those clocks I mean I would like to examine and feel them with my\nown fingers.\u2019\nFollowed by Miss Pebmarsh Hardcastle went out of the kitchen crossed the small hall and\ninto the sitting\u2010room.",
    "The fingerprint man looked up at him.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve about finished in here sir\u2019 he said.",

    "She felt it over carefully.",
    "\u2018It seems an ordinary travelling clock\u2019 she said \u2018the leather folding kind.",

    "Then she\nshook her head.",
    "\u2018It must be a charming clock\u2019 she said \u2018but it\u2019s not mine.",

    "\u2018Yes\u2019 said Hardcastle \u2018there is a candlestick there but it\u2019s been pushed to the end.\u2019\n\u2018You say there was still another clock\u2019\n\u2018Two more.\u2019\nHardcastle took back the Dresden china clock and gave her the small French gilt ormolu\none.",
    "She felt it over rapidly then handed it back to him.",
    "\u2018No.",
    "That is not mine either.\u2019\nHe handed her the silver one and that too she returned.",
    "\u2018The only clocks ordinarily in this room are a grandfather clock there in that corner by the\nwindow\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Quite right.\u2019\n\u2018\u2014and a cuckoo on the wall near the door.\u2019\nHardcastle found it difficult to know exactly what to say next.",
    "He looked searchingly at the\nwoman in front of him with the additional security of knowing that she could not return\nhis survey.",
    "There was a slight frown as of perplexity on her forehead.",

    "The contents of the pockets are on the table.\u2019\nBy an indication of his head he drew attention to a small pile of things on a table.",

    "\u2018Of course the shops\nare nearer that way and there\u2019s a post office in Albany Road\u2014\u2019\n\u2018But perhaps Miss Pebmarsh usually passed your gate about that time\u2019\n\u2018Well really I don\u2019t know what time Miss Pebmarsh usually went out or in which\ndirection.",
    "I\u2019m not really given to watching my neighbours in any way Inspector.",
    "I\u2019m a busy\nwoman and have far too much to do with my own affairs.",
    "Some people I know spend their\nentire time looking out of the window and noticing who passes and who calls on whom.",
    "That is more a habit of invalids or of people who\u2019ve got nothing better to do than to\nspeculate and gossip about their neighbours\u2019 affairs.\u2019\n53\n\n\fMiss Waterhouse spoke with such acerbity that the inspector felt sure that she had some\none particular person in mind.",
    "He said hastily \u2018Quite so.",
    "Quite so.\u2019 He added \u2018Since Miss\nPebmarsh passed your front gate she might have been going to telephone might she not\nThat is where the public telephone box is situated\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "It\u2019s opposite Number 15.\u2019\n\u2018The important question I have to ask you Miss Waterhouse is if you saw the arrival of\nthis man\u2014the mystery man as I\u2019m afraid the morning papers have called him.\u2019\nMiss Waterhouse shook her head.",
    "\u2018No I didn\u2019t see him or any other caller.\u2019\n\u2018What were you doing between half past one and three o\u2019clock\u2019\n\u2018I spent about half an hour doing the crossword in The Times or as much of it as I could\nthen I went out to the kitchen and washed up the lunch.",
    "Let me see.",
    "I wrote a couple of\nletters made some cheques out for bills then I went upstairs and sorted out some things I\nwanted to take to the cleaners.",
    "I think it was from my bedroom that I noticed a certain\namount of commotion next door.",
    "I distinctly heard someone screaming so naturally I\nwent to the window.",
    "There was a young man and a girl at the gate.",
    "He seemed to be\nembracing her.\u2019\nSergeant Lamb shifted his feet but Miss Waterhouse was not looking at him and clearly\nhad no idea that he had been that particular young man in question.",
    "\u2018I could only see the back of the young man\u2019s head.",
    "He seemed to be arguing with the girl.",
    "Finally he sat her down against the gate post.",
    "An extraordinary thing to do.",
    "And he strode\noff and went into the house.\u2019\n\u2018You had not seen Miss Pebmarsh return to the house a short time before\u2019\nMiss Waterhouse shook her head.",
    "\u2018No.",
    "I don\u2019t really think I had looked out the window at\nall until I heard this extraordinary screaming.",
    "However I didn\u2019t pay much attention to all\nthis.",
    "Young girls and men are always doing such extraordinary things\u2014screaming pushing\neach other giggling or making some kind of noise\u2014that I had no idea it was anything\nserious.",
    "Not until some cars drove up with policemen did I realize anything out of the\nordinary had occurred.\u2019\n\u2018What did you do then\u2019\n\u2018Well naturally I went out of the house stood on the steps and then I walked round to the\nback garden.",
    "I wondered what had happened but there didn\u2019t seem to be anything much\nto see from that side.",
    "When I got back again there was quite a little crowd gathering.",
    "Somebody told me there\u2019d been a murder in the house.",
    "It seemed to me most\nextraordinary.",
    "Most extraordinary\u2019 said Miss Waterhouse with a great deal of\ndisapproval.",
    "\u2018There is nothing else you can think of That you can tell us\u2019\n54\n\n\f\u2018Really I\u2019m afraid not.\u2019\n\u2018Has anybody recently written to you suggesting insurance or has anybody called upon\nyou or proposed calling upon you\u2019\n\u2018No.",

    "\u2018No.",
    "I really don\u2019t think it should\u2019 he said.",

    "\u2018We can\u2019t say that till we have evidence to prove it.\u2019\n\u2018Of course not of course not.",
    "You\u2019ve got to be careful.",

    "\u2018Not like some of the people around here.",
    "They\u2019d say anything.",
    "I wonder some aren\u2019t had\nup for libel all the time.\u2019\n\u2018Slander\u2019 corrected Sergeant Lamb speaking for the first time.",

    "\u2018I\u2019m sorry too\u2019 said Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018A person of your intelligence and judgement with a faculty\nof observation would have been a very useful witness to have.\u2019\n\u2018I wish I had seen something\u2019 said Miss Waterhouse.",
    "For a moment her tone was as wistful as a young girl\u2019s.",
    "\u2018Your brother Mr James Waterhouse\u2019\n55\n\n\f\u2018James wouldn\u2019t know anything\u2019 said Miss Waterhouse scornfully.",
    "\u2018He never does.",
    "And\nanyway he was at Gainsford and Swettenhams in the High Street.",
    "Oh no James wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to help you.",
    "As I say he doesn\u2019t come back to lunch.\u2019\n\u2018Where does he lunch usually\u2019\n\u2018He usually has sandwiches and coffee at the Three Feathers.",
    "A very nice respectable\nhouse.",
    "They specialize in quick lunches for professional people.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you Miss Waterhouse.",
    "Well we mustn\u2019t keep you any longer.\u2019\nHe rose and went out into the hall.",

    "\u2018Nice club this\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Plenty of weight in the head.\u2019 He weighed it up and down in his\nhand.",
    "\u2018I see you are prepared Miss Waterhouse for any eventualities.\u2019\nMiss Waterhouse was slightly taken aback.",
    "\u2018Really\u2019 she said \u2018I can\u2019t imagine how that club came to be there.\u2019\nShe snatched it from him and replaced it in the golf bag.",
    "\u2018A very wise precaution to take\u2019 said Hardcastle.",
    "Miss Waterhouse opened the door and let them out.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 said Colin Lamb with a sigh \u2018we didn\u2019t get much out of her in spite of you\nbuttering her up so nicely all the time.",
    "Is that your invariable method\u2019\n\u2018It gets good results sometimes with a person of her type.",
    "The tough kind always respond\nto flattery.\u2019\n\u2018She was purring like a cat that has been offered a saucer of cream in the end\u2019 said Colin.",

    "Miss Pebmarsh went out to the post office\nand the shops but she turned left instead of right and that telephone call according to\nMiss Martindale was put through about ten minutes to two.\u2019\nColin looked at him curiously.",
    "\u2018You still think that in spite of her denial she might have made it She was very positive.\u2019\n56\n\n\f\u2018Yes\u2019 said Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018She was very positive.\u2019\nHis tone was non\u2010committal.",

    "Diana Lodge did not run to neatness or to flower\u2010beds.",
    "Tangled and overgrown shrubbery was its most salient point together with a strong catty\nsmell of ammonia.",
    "The house seemed in a rather tumbledown condition with gutters that\ncould do with repairing.",
    "The only sign of any recent kind of attention being paid to it was a\nfreshly painted front door whose colour of bright azure blue made the general unkempt\nappearance of the rest of the house and garden even more noticeable.",
    "There was no\nelectric bell but a kind of handle that was clearly meant to be pulled.",
    "The inspector pulled\nit and a faint sound of remote jangling was heard inside.",
    "\u2018It sounds\u2019 said Colin \u2018like the Moated Grange.\u2019\nThey waited for a moment or two then sounds were heard from inside.",
    "Rather curious\nsounds.",
    "A kind of high crooning half singing half speaking.",
    "\u2018What the devil\u2014\u2019 began Hardcastle.",
    "The singer or crooner appeared to be approaching the front door and words began to be\ndiscernible.",

    "Gently Sunbeam gently doodleums.\u2019\nIt was then that the inspector perceived that the orange fur was really a cat.",
    "It was not the\nonly cat.",
    "Three other cats appeared along the hall two of them miaowing.",
    "They took up\ntheir place gazing at the visitors twirling gently round their mistress\u2019s skirts.",

    "\u2018Oh no not that room.",

    "The atmosphere here was even more pungent.",
    "\u2018Come on my pretties come on.\u2019\nIn the room various brushes and combs with cat hairs in them lay about on chairs and\ntables.",
    "There were faded and soiled cushions and there were at least six more cats.",

    "\u2018They understand every word I say to them.\u2019\nInspector Hardcastle walked in manfully.",
    "Unfortunately for him he was one of those men\nwho have cat allergy.",
    "As usually happens on these occasions all the cats immediately made\nfor him.",
    "One jumped on his knee another rubbed affectionately against his trousers.",

    "You have probably heard about\nit.\u2019\n\u2018Next door You mean Mr Joshua\u2019s dog\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 said Hardcastle \u2018I do not.",
    "I mean at Number 19 where a man was found murdered\nyesterday.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed\u2019 said Mrs Hemming with polite interest but no more.",
    "Her eyes were still straying\nover her pets.",
    "\u2018Were you at home yesterday afternoon may I ask That is to say between half past one\nand half past three\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes indeed.",

    "I tried to\ntempt her with a saucer of fish but she was frightened poor little thing.",
    "I had to give up in\nthe end and come back into the house.",
    "And would you believe it just as I went through\nthe door down she came and followed me in.\u2019 She looked from one man to the other as\nthough testing their powers of belief.",
    "\u2018Matter of fact I would believe it\u2019 said Colin unable to keep silence any more.",
    "\u2018I beg your pardon\u2019 Mrs Hemming looked at him slightly startled.",
    "\u2018I am much attached to cats\u2019 said Colin \u2018and I have therefore made a study of cat nature.",
    "What you have told me illustrates perfectly the pattern of cat behaviour and the rules they\nhave made for themselves.",
    "In the same way your cats are all congregating round my friend\nwho frankly does not care for cats they will pay no attention to me in spite of all my\nblandishments.\u2019\nIf it occurred to Mrs Hemming that Colin was hardly speaking in the proper role of\nsergeant of police no trace of it appeared in her face.",
    "She merely murmured vaguely\n\u2018They always know the dear things don\u2019t they\u2019\nA handsome grey Persian put two paws on Inspector Hardcastle\u2019s knees looked at him in\nan ecstasy of pleasure and dug his claws in hard with a kneading action as though the\ninspector was a pincushion.",

    "In Colin\u2019s opinion both he and Hardcastle were wasting\ntheir time.",
    "There was a solid barrage of laurels trees and shrubs through which nothing of\nMiss Pebmarsh\u2019s garden could possibly be seen.",

    "From the point of view of its inhabitants it might have had no\nneighbours.",
    "\u2018Number 19 did you say\u2019 said Mrs Hemming pausing irresolutely in the middle of her\nback garden.",

    "I was clearing away a\nlot of stuff adding to the compost heap and all that.\u2019\n\u2018Wonderful thing a compost heap\u2019 said Hardcastle solemnly.",
    "Mr McNaughton brightened immediately.",
    "\u2018Absolutely.",
    "Nothing like it.",
    "Ah The number of people I\u2019ve converted.",
    "Using all these\nchemical manures Suicide Let me show you.\u2019\n83\n\n\fHe drew Hardcastle eagerly by the arm and trundling his barrow went along the path to\nthe edge of the fence that divided his garden from that of No.",
    "19.",
    "Screened by lilac\nbushes the compost heap was displayed in its glory.",
    "Mr McNaughton wheeled the\nwheelbarrow to a small shed beside it.",
    "Inside the shed were several nicely arranged tools.",
    "\u2018Very tidy you keep everything\u2019 remarked Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018Got to take care of your tools\u2019 said McNaughton.",
    "Hardcastle was looking thoughtfully towards No.",
    "19.",
    "On the other side of the fence was a\nrose pergola which led up to the side of the house.",
    "\u2018You didn\u2019t see anyone in the garden at Number 19 or looking out of the window in the\nhouse or anything like that while you were at your compost heap\u2019\nMcNaughton shook his head.",

    "\u2018I didn\u2019t either.\u2019\n\u2018That woman would say she\u2019d seen anything\u2019 Hardcastle growled when they were back in\nthe car.",

    "When I pinned her down to it she couldn\u2019t give chapter or\nverse could she\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\n\u2018Of course she may have sat opposite him in a bus or something.",
    "I\u2019ll allow you that.",

    "What do you think\u2019\n\u2018I think the same.\u2019\n\u2018We didn\u2019t get much\u2019 Hardcastle sighed.",
    "\u2018Of course there are things that seem queer.",
    "For\ninstance it seems almost impossible that Mrs Hemming\u2014no matter how wrapped up in\nher cats she is\u2014should know so little about her neighbour Miss Pebmarsh as she does.",
    "And also that she should be so extremely vague and uninterested in the murder.\u2019\n\u2018She is a vague kind of woman.\u2019\n\u2018Scatty\u2019 said Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018When you meet a scatty woman\u2014well fires burglaries murders\ncan go on all round them and they wouldn\u2019t notice it.\u2019\n84\n\n\f\u2018She\u2019s very well fenced in with all that wire netting and that Victorian shrubbery doesn\u2019t\nleave you much of a view.\u2019\nThey had arrived back at the police station.",
    "Hardcastle grinned at his friend and said\n\u2018Well Sergeant Lamb I can let you go off duty now.\u2019\n\u2018No more visits to pay\u2019\n\u2018Not just now.",
    "I must pay one more later but I\u2019m not taking you with me.\u2019\n\u2018Well thanks for this morning.",
    "Can you get these notes of mine typed up\u2019 He handed\nthem over.",

    "I\u2019ll be back for it.\u2019\n\u2018Are you going away\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve got to go up to London tomorrow\u2014make my report up to date.\u2019\n\u2018I can guess who to.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to do that.\u2019\nHardcastle grinned.",
    "\u2018Give the old boy my love.\u2019\n\u2018Also I may be going to see a specialist\u2019 said Colin.",
    "\u2018A specialist What for What\u2019s wrong with you\u2019\n\u2018Nothing\u2014bar thick\u2010headedness.",

    "One in your line.\u2019\n\u2018Scotland Yard\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "A private detective\u2014a friend of my Dad\u2019s\u2014and a friend of mine.",
    "This fantastic\nbusiness of yours will be just down his street.",
    "He\u2019ll love it\u2014it will cheer him up.",

    "I thought he was dead.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s not dead.",
    "But I have a feeling he\u2019s bored.",
    "That\u2019s worse.\u2019\n85\n\n\fHardcastle looked at him curiously.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re an odd fellow Colin.",
    "You make such unlikely friends.\u2019\n\u2018Including you\u2019 Colin said and grinned.",
    "86\n\n\fChapter 12\nHaving dismissed Colin Inspector Hardcastle looked at the address neatly written in his\nnote\u2010book and nodded his head.",
    "Then he slipped the book back in his pocket and started\nto deal with the routine matters that had piled up on his desk.",
    "It was a busy day for him.",
    "He sent out for coffee and sandwiches and received reports\nfrom Sergeant Cray\u2014no helpful lead had come up.",
    "Nobody at the railway station or buses\nhad recognized the photograph of Mr Curry.",
    "The laboratory reports on clothing added up\nto nil.",
    "The suit had been made by a good tailor but the tailor\u2019s name had been removed.",
    "Desire for anonymity on the part of Mr Curry Or on the part of his killer.",
    "Details of\ndentistry had been circulated to the proper quarters and were probably the most helpful\nleads\u2014it took a little time\u2014but it got results in the end.",
    "Unless of course Mr Curry had\nbeen a foreigner Hardcastle considered the idea.",
    "There might be a possibility that the\ndead man was French\u2014on the other hand his clothes were definitely not French.",
    "No\nlaundry marks had helped yet.",
    "Hardcastle was not impatient.",
    "Identification was quite often a slow job.",
    "But in the end\nsomeone always came forward.",
    "A laundry a dentist a doctor a landlady.",
    "The picture of\nthe dead man would be circulated to police stations would be reproduced in newspapers.",
    "Sooner or later Mr Curry would be known in his rightful identity.",
    "In the meantime there was work to be done and not only on the Curry case.",
    "Hardcastle\nworked without a break until half past five.",
    "He looked at his wrist\u2010watch again and decided\nthe time was ripe for the call he wanted to make.",
    "Sergeant Cray had reported that Sheila Webb had resumed work at the Cavendish Bureau\nand that at five o\u2019clock she would be working with Professor Purdy at the Curlew Hotel\nand that she was unlikely to leave there until well after six.",
    "What was the aunt\u2019s name again Lawton\u2014Mrs Lawton.",
    "14 Palmerston Road.",
    "He did not\ntake a police car but chose to walk the short distance.",
    "Palmerston Road was a gloomy street that had known as is said better days.",
    "The houses\nHardcastle noted had been mainly converted into flats or maisonettes.",
    "As he turned the\ncorner a girl who was approaching him along the sidewalk hesitated for a moment.",
    "His\nmind occupied the inspector had some momentary idea that she was going to ask him the\nway to somewhere.",
    "However if that was so the girl thought better of it and resumed her\nwalk past him.",
    "He wondered why the idea of shoes came into his mind so suddenly.",
    "Shoes... No one shoe.",
    "The girl\u2019s face was faintly familiar to him.",
    "Who was it now\u2014\nsomeone he had seen just lately... Perhaps she had recognized him and was about to\nspeak to him\nHe paused for a moment looking back after her.",
    "She was walking quite fast now.",
    "The\ntrouble was he thought she had one of those indeterminate faces that are very hard to\nrecognize unless there is some special reason for doing so.",
    "Blue eyes fair complexion\nslightly open mouth.",
    "Mouth.",
    "That recalled something also.",
    "Something that she\u2019d been\ndoing with her mouth Talking Putting on lipstick No.",
    "He felt slightly annoyed with\n87\n\n\fhimself.",
    "Hardcastle prided himself on his recognition of faces.",
    "He never forgot he\u2019d been\napt to say a face he had seen in the dock or in the witness\u2010box but there were after all\nother places of contact.",
    "He would not be likely to remember for instance every waitress\nwho had ever served him.",
    "He would not remember every bus conductress.",
    "He dismissed\nthe matter from his mind.",
    "He had arrived now at No.",
    "14.",
    "The door stood ajar and there were four bells with names\nunderneath.",
    "Mrs Lawton he saw had a flat on the ground floor.",
    "He went in and pressed\nthe bell on the door on the left of the hall.",
    "It was a few moments before it was answered.",
    "Finally he heard steps inside and the door was opened by a tall thin woman with\nstraggling dark hair who had on an overall and seemed a little short of breath.",
    "The smell of\nonions wafted along from the direction of what was obviously the kitchen.",
    "\u2018Mrs Lawton\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 She looked at him doubtfully with slight annoyance.",
    "She was he thought about forty\u2010five.",
    "Something faintly gypsyish about her appearance.",
    "\u2018What is it\u2019\n\u2018I should be glad if you could spare me a moment or two.\u2019\n\u2018Well what about I\u2019m really rather busy just now.\u2019 She added sharply \u2018You\u2019re not a\nreporter are you\u2019\n\u2018Of course\u2019 said Hardcastle adopting a sympathetic tone \u2018I expect you\u2019ve been a good\ndeal worried by reporters.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed we have.",
    "Knocking at the door and ringing the bell and asking all sorts of foolish\nquestions.\u2019\n\u2018Very annoying I know\u2019 said the inspector.",
    "\u2018I wish we could spare you all that Mrs Lawton.",
    "I am Detective Inspector Hardcastle by the way in charge of the case about which the\nreporters have been annoying you.",
    "We\u2019d put a stop to a good deal of that if we could but\nwe\u2019re powerless in the matter you know.",
    "The Press has its rights.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s a shame to worry private people as they do\u2019 said Mrs Lawton \u2018saying they have to\nhave news for the public.",
    "The only thing I\u2019ve ever noticed about the news that they print is\nthat it\u2019s a tissue of lies from beginning to end.",
    "They\u2019ll cook up anything so far as I can see.",
    "But come in.\u2019\nShe stepped back and the inspector passed over the doorstep and she shut the door.",
    "There were a couple of letters which had fallen on the mat.",
    "Mrs Lawton bent forward to\npick them up but the inspector politely forestalled her.",
    "His eyes swept over them for half\na second as he handed them to her addresses uppermost.",
    "\u2018Thank you.\u2019\n88\n\n\fShe laid them down on the hall table.",
    "\u2018Come into the sitting\u2010room won\u2019t you At least\u2014if you go in this door and give me just a\nmoment.",
    "I think something\u2019s boiling over.\u2019\nShe beat a speedy retreat to the kitchen.",
    "Inspector Hardcastle took a last deliberate look\nat the letters on the hall table.",
    "One was addressed to Mrs Lawton and the two others to\nMiss R. S. Webb.",
    "He went into the room indicated.",
    "It was a small room rather untidy\nshabbily furnished but here and there it displayed some bright spot of colour or some\nunusual object.",
    "An attractive probably expensive piece of Venetian glass of moulded\ncolours and an abstract shape two brightly coloured velvet cushions and an earthenware\nplatter of foreign shells.",
    "Either the aunt or the niece he thought had an original streak in\nher make\u2010up.",
    "Mrs Lawton returned slightly more breathless than before.",
    "\u2018I think that\u2019ll be all right now\u2019 she said rather uncertainly.",
    "The inspector apologized again.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve called at an inconvenient time\u2019 he said \u2018but I happened to be in this\nneighbourhood and I wanted to check over a few further points about this affair in which\nyour niece was so unfortunately concerned.",
    "I hope she\u2019s none the worse for her\nexperience It must have been a great shock to any girl.\u2019\n\u2018Yes indeed\u2019 said Mrs Lawton.",
    "\u2018Sheila came back in a terrible state.",
    "But she was all right\nby this morning and she\u2019s gone back to work again.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes I know that\u2019 said the inspector.",
    "\u2018But I was told she was out doing work for a\nclient somewhere and I didn\u2019t want to interrupt anything of that kind so I thought it would\nbe better if I came round here and talked to her in her own home.",
    "But she\u2019s not back yet\nis that it\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019ll probably be rather late this evening\u2019 said Mrs Lawton.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s working for a\nProfessor Purdy and from what Sheila says he\u2019s a man with no idea of time at all.",
    "Always\nsays \u201cthis won\u2019t take more than another ten minutes so I think we might as well get it\nfinished\u201d and then of course it takes nearer to three\u2010quarters of an hour.",
    "He\u2019s a very nice\nman and most apologetic.",
    "Once or twice he\u2019s urged her to stay and have dinner and\nseemed quite concerned because he\u2019s kept her so much longer than he realized.",
    "Still it is\nrather annoying sometimes.",
    "Is there something I can tell you Inspector In case Sheila is\ndelayed a long time.\u2019\n\u2018Well not really\u2019 said the inspector smiling.",
    "\u2018Of course we only took down the bare\ndetails the other day and I\u2019m not sure really whether I\u2019ve even got those right.\u2019 He made a\nshow of consulting his note\u2010book once more.",
    "\u2018Let me see.",
    "Miss Sheila Webb\u2014is that her\nfull name or has she another Christian name We have to have these things very exact\nyou know for the records at the inquest.\u2019\n89\n\n\f\u2018The inquest is the day after tomorrow isn\u2019t it She got a notice to attend.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but she needn\u2019t let that worry her\u2019 said Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018She\u2019ll just have to tell her story\nof how she found the body.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t know who the man was yet\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s early days for that.",
    "There was a card in his pocket and we thought at\nfirst he was some kind of insurance agent.",
    "But it seems more likely now that it was a card\nhe\u2019d been given by someone.",
    "Perhaps he was contemplating insurance himself.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I see\u2019 Mrs Lawton looked vaguely interested.",
    "\u2018Now I\u2019ll just get these names right\u2019 said the inspector.",
    "\u2018I think I\u2019ve got it down as Miss\nSheila Webb or Miss Sheila R. Webb.",
    "I just couldn\u2019t remember what the other name was.",
    "Was it Rosalie\u2019\n\u2018Rosemary\u2019 said Mrs Lawton \u2018she was christened Rosemary Sheila but Sheila always\nthought Rosemary was rather fanciful so she\u2019s never called anything but Sheila.\u2019\n\u2018I see.\u2019 There was nothing in Hardcastle\u2019s tone to show that he was pleased that one of his\nhunches had come out right.",
    "He noted another point.",
    "The name Rosemary occasioned no\ndistress in Mrs Lawton.",
    "To her Rosemary was simply a Christian name that her niece did\nnot use.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve got it straight now all right\u2019 said the inspector smiling.",
    "\u2018I gather that your niece came\nfrom London and has been working for the Cavendish Bureau for the last ten months or\nso.",
    "You don\u2019t know the exact date I suppose\u2019\n\u2018Well really I couldn\u2019t say now.",
    "It was last November some time.",
    "I think more towards the\nend of November.\u2019\n\u2018Quite so.",
    "It doesn\u2019t really matter.",
    "She was not living with you here previously to taking the\njob at the Cavendish Bureau\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "She was living in London before that.\u2019\n\u2018Have you got her address in London\u2019\n\u2018Well I\u2019ve got it somewhere\u2019 Mrs Lawton looked round her with the vague expression of\nthe habitually untidy.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve got such a short memory\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Something like Allington\nGrove I think it was\u2014out Fulham way.",
    "She shared a flat with two other girls.",
    "Terribly\nexpensive rooms are in London for girls.\u2019\n\u2018Do you remember the name of the firm she worked at there\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes.",
    "Hopgood and Trent.",
    "They were estate agents in the Fulham Road.\u2019\n90\n\n\f\u2018Thank you.",
    "Well all that seems very clear.",
    "Miss Webb is an orphan I understand\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Mrs Lawton.",
    "She moved uneasily.",
    "Her eyes strayed to the door.",
    "\u2018Do you mind if I\njust go into the kitchen again\u2019\n\u2018Of course.\u2019\nHe opened the door for her.",
    "She went out.",
    "He wondered if he had been right or wrong in\nthinking that his last question had in some way perturbed Mrs Lawton.",
    "Her replies had\ncome quite readily and easily up to then.",
    "He thought about it until Mrs Lawton returned.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u2019 she said apologetically \u2018but you know what it is\u2014cooking things.",
    "Everything\u2019s quite all right now.",
    "Was there anything else you want to ask me I\u2019ve\nremembered by the way it wasn\u2019t Allington Grove.",
    "It was Carrington Grove and the\nnumber was 17.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you\u2019 said the inspector.",
    "\u2018I think I was asking you whether Miss Webb was an\norphan.\u2019\n\u2018Yes she\u2019s an orphan.",
    "Her parents are dead.\u2019\n\u2018Long ago\u2019\n\u2018They died when she was a child.\u2019\nThere was something like defiance just perceptible in her tone.",
    "\u2018Was she your sister\u2019s child or your brother\u2019s\u2019\n\u2018My sister\u2019s.\u2019\n\u2018Ah yes.",
    "And what was Mr Webb\u2019s profession\u2019\nMrs Lawton paused a moment before answering.",
    "She was biting her lips.",
    "Then she said \u2018I\ndon\u2019t know.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t know\u2019\n\u2018I mean I don\u2019t remember it\u2019s so long ago.\u2019\nHardcastle waited knowing that she would speak again.",
    "She did.",
    "\u2018May I ask what all this has got to do with it\u2014I mean what does it matter who her father\nand mother were and what her father did and where he came from or anything like that\u2019\n\u2018I suppose it doesn\u2019t matter really Mrs Lawton not from your point of view that is.",
    "But\nyou see the circumstances are rather unusual.\u2019\n91\n\n\f\u2018What do you mean\u2014the circumstances are unusual\u2019\n\u2018Well we have reason to believe that Miss Webb went to that house yesterday because\nshe had been specially asked for at the Cavendish Bureau by name.",
    "It looks therefore as\nthough someone had deliberately arranged for her to be there.",
    "Someone perhaps\u2014\u2019 he\nhesitated \u2018\u2014with a grudge against her.\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t imagine that anyone could have a grudge against Sheila.",
    "She\u2019s a very sweet girl.",
    "A\nnice friendly girl.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Hardcastle mildly.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s what I should have thought myself.\u2019\n\u2018And I don\u2019t like to hear anybody suggesting the contrary\u2019 said Mrs Lawton belligerently.",
    "\u2018Exactly.\u2019 Hardcastle continued to smile appeasingly.",
    "\u2018But you must realize Mrs Lawton\nthat it looks as though your niece has been deliberately made a victim.",
    "She was being as\nthey say on the films put on the spot.",

    "But not involving murder surely.\u2019\nIt was a shrewd appreciation and Hardcastle noted that Mrs Lawton was by no means a\nfool.",
    "92\n\n\fHe said quickly \u2018I know it all sounds most unlikely but then this whole business is\nunlikely.\u2019\n\u2018It must have been someone mad\u2019 said Mrs Lawton.",

    "Highly respected and everything else.",
    "The last person you\u2019d\never think would\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019 said the inspector tactfully \u2018it often happens that way.",

    "It was conceivable he thought that she might feel like that about the child.",
    "But what\nabout her sister He said mildly \u2018It seems odd that she did not at least keep in touch with\nyou by letter did not want to know how the child was progressing\u2019\n94\n\n\fMrs Lawton shook her head.",
    "\u2018Not if you knew Ann\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018She was always very clear\u2010cut in her decisions.",
    "And then\nshe and I weren\u2019t very close.",
    "I was younger than she was by a good deal\u2014twelve years.",
    "As\nI say we were never very close.\u2019\n\u2018And what did your husband feel about this adoption\u2019\n\u2018I was a widow then\u2019 said Mrs Lawton.",

    "They\u2019re very pleasant people.\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019 said Hardcastle rising to his feet \u2018thank you very much Mrs Lawton for your\nfrankness in what you have told me.\u2019\n\u2018And you won\u2019t say a word of it to Sheila\u2019\n\u2018Not unless it should become necessary and that would only happen if some\ncircumstances out of the past proved to have been connected with this murder at 19\nWilbraham Crescent.",
    "And that I think is unlikely.\u2019 He took the photograph from his pocket\nwhich he had been showing to so many people and showed it to Mrs Lawton.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve no\nidea who this man could be\u2019\n\u2018They\u2019ve shown it me already\u2019 said Mrs Lawton.",

    "\u2018No.",
    "I\u2019m sure quite sure I\u2019ve never seen this man before.",
    "I don\u2019t think he belonged round\nhere or I might have remembered seeing him about.",
    "Of course\u2014\u2019 she looked closely.",
    "She\npaused a moment before adding rather unexpectedly \u2018He looks a nice man I think.",
    "A\ngentleman I\u2019d say wouldn\u2019t you\u2019\nIt was a slightly outmoded term in the inspector\u2019s experience yet it fell very naturally from\nMrs Lawton\u2019s lips.",
    "\u2018Brought up in the country\u2019 he thought.",
    "\u2018They still think of things that\nway.\u2019 He looked at the photograph again himself reflecting with faint surprise that he had\nnot thought of the dead man in quite that way.",
    "Was he a nice man He had been assuming\njust the contrary.",
    "Assuming it unconsciously perhaps or influenced perhaps by the fact\nthat the man had a card in his pocket which bore a name and an address which were\nobviously false.",
    "But the explanation he had given to Mrs Lawton just now might have been\nthe true one.",
    "It might have been that the card did represent some bogus insurance agent\nwho had pressed the card upon the dead man.",
    "And that he thought wryly would really\nmake the whole thing even more difficult.",
    "He glanced at his watch again.",
    "95\n\n\f\u2018I mustn\u2019t keep you from your cooking any longer\u2019 he said \u2018since your niece is not home\nyet\u2014\u2019\nMrs Lawton in turn looked at the clock on the mantelpiece.",

    "\u2018Yes she is late\u2019 she remarked.",
    "\u2018Surprising really.",
    "It\u2019s a good thing Edna didn\u2019t wait.\u2019\nSeeing a slightly puzzled expression on Hardcastle\u2019s face she explained.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s just one of the girls from the office.",
    "She came here to see Sheila this evening and she\nwaited a bit but after a while she said she couldn\u2019t wait any longer.",
    "She\u2019d got a date with\nsomeone.",
    "She said it would do tomorrow or some other time.\u2019\nEnlightenment came to the inspector.",
    "The girl he had passed in the street He knew now\nwhy she\u2019d made him think of shoes.",
    "Of course.",
    "It was the girl who had received him in the\nCavendish Bureau and the girl who when he left had been holding up a shoe with a\nstiletto heel torn off it and had been discussing in unhappy puzzlement how on earth she\nwas going to get home like that.",
    "A nondescript kind of girl he remembered not very\nattractive sucking some kind of sweet as she talked.",
    "She had recognized him when she\npassed him in the street although he had not recognized her.",
    "She had hesitated too as\nthough she thought of speaking to him.",
    "He wondered rather idly what she had wanted to\nsay.",
    "Had she wanted to explain why she was calling on Sheila Webb or had she thought he\nwould expect her to say something He asked \u2018Is she a great friend of your niece\u2019s\u2019\n\u2018Well not particularly\u2019 said Mrs Lawton.",

    "Not very bright and she and Sheila aren\u2019t particular friends.",
    "In\nfact I wondered why she was so keen to see Sheila tonight.",
    "She said it was something she\ncouldn\u2019t understand and that she wanted to ask Sheila about it.\u2019\n\u2018She didn\u2019t tell you what it was\u2019\n\u2018No she said it would keep and it didn\u2019t matter.\u2019\n\u2018I see.",
    "Well I must be going.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s odd\u2019 said Mrs Lawton \u2018that Sheila hasn\u2019t telephoned.",
    "She usually does if she\u2019s late\nbecause the professor sometimes asks her to stay to dinner.",
    "Ah well I expect she\u2019ll be\nhere any moment now.",
    "There are a lot of bus queues sometimes and the Curlew Hotel is\nquite a good way along the Esplanade.",

    "As he went out he asked \u2018By the way who chose your niece\u2019s Christian names Rosemary\nand Sheila Your sister or yourself\u2019\n96\n\n\f\u2018Sheila was our mother\u2019s name.",
    "Rosemary was my sister\u2019s choice.",
    "Funny name to choose\nreally.",
    "Fanciful.",
    "And yet my sister wasn\u2019t fanciful or sentimental in any way.\u2019\n\u2018Well good night Mrs Lawton.\u2019\nAs the inspector turned the corner from the gateway into the street he thought\n\u2018Rosemary\u2014hm... Rosemary for remembrance.",

    "The distance between bookshelves was so narrow\nthat you could only get along with great difficulty.",
    "There were piles of books perched on\nevery shelf or table.",
    "On a stool in a corner hemmed in by books was an old man in a pork\u2010\npie hat with a large flat face like a stuffed fish.",
    "He had the air of one who has given up an\nunequal struggle.",
    "He had attempted to master the books but the books had obviously\nsucceeded in mastering him.",

    "The happenings in them are highly improbable.",
    "The long arm of coincidence is far too\nfreely employed.",

    "Then\nperhaps she forgets all about it.\u2019\n\u2018But you don\u2019t think that she would do murder\u2019\n\u2018I never suggested murder or anything of that kind.",

    "No.",

    "Dentists had not helped nor laundries\nnor cleaners.",
    "The dead man remained a \u2018mystery man\u2019 And yet Hardcastle felt he was\nnot really a \u2018mystery man\u2019.",
    "There was nothing spectacular or dramatic about him.",
    "He was\njust a man whom nobody had been able to come forward and recognize.",
    "That was the\npattern of it he was sure.",
    "Hardcastle sighed as he thought of the telephone calls and\nletters that had necessarily poured in after the publication in the public press of the\nphotograph with the caption below it DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN Astonishing the amount\nof people who thought they did know this man.",
    "Daughters who wrote in a hopeful vein of\nfathers from whom they\u2019d been estranged for years.",
    "An old woman of ninety was sure\nthat the photograph in question was her son who had left home thirty years ago.",
    "Innumerable wives had been sure that it was a missing husband.",
    "Sisters had not been\nquite so anxious to claim brothers.",
    "Sisters perhaps were less hopeful thinkers.",
    "And of\ncourse there were vast numbers of people who had seen that very man in Lincolnshire\nNewcastle Devon London on a tube in a bus lurking on a pier looking sinister at the\ncorner of a road trying to hide his face as he came out of the cinema.",
    "Hundreds of leads\nthe more promising of them patiently followed up and not yielding anything.",

    "Merlina Rival.",
    "He didn\u2019t like the Christian name very much.",
    "Nobody in their senses\nhe thought could christen a child Merlina.",
    "No doubt it was a fancy name adopted by the\nlady herself.",
    "But he liked the feel of the letter.",
    "It was not extravagant or over\u2010confident.",
    "It\nmerely said that the writer thought it possible that the man in question was her husband\nfrom whom she had parted several years ago.",

    "No hat medium height and build wearing a dark\ncoat and skirt and a white blouse.",
    "Carrying a large tartan bag.",
    "A jingly bracelet or two\nseveral rings.",

    "Nice town.",

    "I never thought about it much to begin with\u2014\u2019\n\u2018But later\u2019\nShe did not answer at once then she said \u2018Can\u2019t we get on with it After all if it isn\u2019t\nHarry...\u2019\nHe wondered what exactly she was thinking.",
    "There was strain in her voice possibly\nemotion He was not sure.",

    "We\u2019ll go now.\u2019\nHe rose and escorted her out of the room to the waiting car.",
    "Her nervousness when they\ngot to where they were going was no more than the nervousness of other people he had\ntaken to this same place.",
    "He said the usual reassuring things.",

    "Nothing distressing.",
    "It will only take a minute or two.\u2019\nThe tray was rolled out the attendant lifted the sheet.",

    "Good class.",

    "Then after we were married he told me about some\nwonderful opportunity he\u2019d got.",
    "I said \u201cNothing doing.\u201d It wasn\u2019t only because I didn\u2019t\ntrust him but I\u2019d often heard men say they\u2019re on to something wonderful and then it\nturned out that they\u2019d been had for a mug themselves.\u2019\n\u2018Had your husband ever been in trouble with the police\u2019\n\u2018No fear\u2019 said Mrs Rival.",

    "Whether it was only the money\u2014a way of getting a living as you might\nsay\u2014or whether he was the kind of man who just had to have women and he saw no\nreason why they shouldn\u2019t pay the expenses of his fun.\u2019 There was no bitterness now in\nher voice.",

    "He indulges that master He too boasts of his master boasts of his\nmaster\u2019s sagacity and intelligence.",
    "And as a man will rouse himself when he does not\nreally want to go out and take his dog for a walk because the dog enjoys the walk so\nmuch so will the dog endeavour to give his master what that master pines to have.",
    "\u2018It was so with my kind young friend Colin here.",
    "He came to see me not to ask for help\nwith his own problem that he was confident that he could solve for himself and has I\ngather done so.",
    "No he felt concern that I was unoccupied and lonely so he brought to me\na problem that he felt would interest me and give me something to work upon.",
    "He\nchallenged me with it\u2014challenged me to do what I had so often told him it was possible to\ndo\u2014sit still in my chair and\u2014in due course\u2014resolve that problem.",
    "It may be I suspect it\nis that there was a little malice just a small harmless amount behind that challenge.",
    "He\nwanted let us say to prove to me that it was not so easy after all.",
    "Mais oui mon ami it is\ntrue that You wanted to mock yourself at me\u2014just a little I do not reproach you.",
    "All I\nsay is you did not know your Hercule Poirot.\u2019\nHe thrust out his chest and twirled his moustaches.",
    "I looked at him and grinned affectionately.",
    "\u2018All right then\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Give us the answer to the problem\u2014if you know it.\u2019\n\u2018But of course I know it\u2019\nHardcastle stared at him incredulously.",
    "\u2018Are you saying you know who killed the man at 19 Wilbraham Crescent\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.\u2019\n\u2018And also who killed Edna Brent\u2019\n\u2018Of course.\u2019\n\u2018You know the identity of the dead man\u2019\n\u2018I know who he must be.\u2019\nHardcastle had a very doubtful expression on his face.",
    "Mindful of the chief constable he\nremained polite.",
    "But there was scepticism in his voice.",
    "\u2018Excuse me M. Poirot you claim that you know who killed three people.",
    "And why\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n214\n\n\f\u2018You\u2019ve got an open and shut case\u2019\n\u2018That no.\u2019\n\u2018All you mean is that you have a hunch\u2019 I said unkindly.",
    "\u2018I will not quarrel with you over a word mon cher Colin.",
    "All I say is I know\u2019\nHardcastle sighed.",
    "\u2018But you see M. Poirot I have to have evidence.\u2019\n\u2018Naturally but with the resources you have at your disposal it will be possible for you I\nthink to get that evidence.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u2019\n\u2018Come now Inspector.",
    "If you know\u2014really know\u2014is not that the first step Can you not\nnearly always go on from there\u2019\n\u2018Not always\u2019 said Hardcastle with a sigh.",
    "\u2018There are men walking about today who ought\nto be in gaol.",
    "They know it and we know it.\u2019\n\u2018But that is a very small percentage is it not\u2014\u2019\nI interrupted.",
    "\u2018All right.",
    "All right.",
    "You know... Now let us know too\u2019\n\u2018I perceive you are still sceptical.",
    "But first let me say this To be sure means that when the\nright solution is reached everything falls into place.",
    "You perceive that in no other way\ncould things have happened.\u2019\n\u2018For the love of Mike\u2019 I said \u2018get on with it I grant you all the points you\u2019ve made.\u2019\nPoirot arranged himself comfortably in his chair and motioned to the inspector to\nreplenish his glass.",
    "\u2018One thing mes amis must be clearly understood.",
    "To solve any problem one must have\nthe facts.",
    "For that one needs the dog the dog who is a retriever who brings the pieces\none by one and lays them at\u2014\u2019\n\u2018At the feet of the master\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Admitted.\u2019\n\u2018One cannot from one\u2019s seat in a chair solve a case solely from reading about it in a\nnewspaper.",
    "For one\u2019s facts must be accurate and newspapers are seldom if ever\naccurate.",
    "They report something happened at four o\u2019clock when it was a quarter past four\nthey say a man had a sister called Elizabeth when actually he had a sister\u2010in\u2010law called\n215\n\n\fAlexandra.",
    "And so on.",
    "But in Colin here I have a dog of remarkable ability\u2014an ability I\nmay say which has taken him far in his own career.",
    "He has always had a remarkable\nmemory.",
    "He can repeat to you even several days later conversations that have taken\nplace.",
    "He can repeat them accurately\u2014that is not transposing them as nearly all of us do\nto what the impression made on him was.",
    "To explain roughly\u2014he would not say \u201cAnd at\ntwenty past eleven the post came\u201d instead of describing what actually happened namely\na knock on the front door and someone coming into the room with letters in their hand.",
    "All this is very important.",
    "It means that he heard what I would have heard if I had been\nthere and seen what I would have seen.\u2019\n\u2018Only the poor dog hasn\u2019t made the necessary deductions\u2019\n\u2018So as far as can be I have the facts\u2014I am \u201cin the picture\u201d.",
    "It is your war\u2010time term is it\nnot To \u201cput one in the picture\u201d.",
    "The thing that struck me first of all when Colin\nrecounted the story to me was its highly fantastic character.",
    "Four clocks each roughly an\nhour ahead of the right time and all introduced into the house without the knowledge of\nthe owner or so she said.",
    "For we must never must we believe what we are told until\nsuch statements have been carefully checked\u2019\n\u2018Your mind works the way that mine does\u2019 said Hardcastle approvingly.",
    "\u2018On the floor lies a dead man\u2014a respectable\u2010looking elderly man.",
    "Nobody knows who he\nis or again so they say.",
    "In his pocket is a card bearing the name of Mr R. H. Curry 7\nDenvers Street.",
    "Metropolis Insurance Company.",
    "But there is no Metropolis Insurance\nCompany.",
    "There is no Denvers Street and there seems to be no such person as Mr Curry.",
    "That is negative evidence but it is evidence.",
    "We now proceed further.",
    "Apparently at about\nten minutes to two a secretarial agency is rung up a Miss Millicent Pebmarsh asks for a\nstenographer to be sent to 19 Wilbraham Crescent at three o\u2019clock.",
    "It is particularly asked\nthat a Miss Sheila Webb should be sent.",
    "Miss Webb is sent.",
    "She arrives there at a few\nminutes before three goes according to instructions into the sitting\u2010room finds a dead\nman on the floor and rushes out of the house screaming.",
    "She rushes into the arms of a\nyoung man.\u2019\nPoirot paused and looked at me.",
    "I bowed.",
    "\u2018Enter our young hero\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018You see\u2019 Poirot pointed out.",
    "\u2018Even you cannot resist a farcical melodramatic tone when\nyou speak of it.",
    "The whole thing is melodramatic fantastic and completely unreal.",
    "It is the\nkind of thing that could occur in the writings of such people as Garry Gregson for\ninstance.",
    "I may mention that when my young friend arrived with this tale I was embarking\non a course of thriller writers who had plied their craft over the last sixty years.",
    "Most\ninteresting.",
    "One comes almost to regard actual crimes in the light of fiction.",
    "That is to say\nthat if I observe that a dog has not barked when he should bark I say to myself \u201cHa A\nSherlock Holmes crime\u201d Similarly if the corpse is found in a sealed room naturally I say\n\u201cHa A Dickson Carr case\u201d Then there is my friend Mrs Oliver.",
    "If I were to find\u2014but I will\nsay no more.",
    "You catch my meaning So here is the setting of a crime in such wildly\nimprobable circumstances that one feels at once \u201cThis book is not true to life.",
    "All this is\n216\n\n\fquite unreal.\u201d But alas that will not do here for this is real.",
    "It happened.",
    "That gives one to\nthink furiously does it not\u2019\nHardcastle would not have put it like that but he fully agreed with the sentiment and\nnodded vigorously.",
    "Poirot went on \u2018It is as it were the opposite of Chesterton\u2019s \u201cWhere\nwould you hide a leaf In a forest.",
    "Where would you hide a pebble On a beach.\u201d Here\nthere is excess fantasy melodrama When I say to myself in imitation of Chesterton\n\u201cWhere does a middle\u2010aged woman hide her fading beauty\u201d I do not reply \u201cAmongst\nother faded middle\u2010aged faces.\u201d Not at all.",
    "She hides it under make\u2010up under rouge and\nmascara with handsome furs wrapped round her and with jewels round her neck and\nhanging in her ears.",
    "You follow me\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2014\u2019 said the inspector disguising the fact that he didn\u2019t.",
    "\u2018Because then you see people will look at the furs and the jewels and the coiffure and the\nhaute couture and they will not observe what the woman herself is like at all So I say to\nmyself\u2014and I say to my friend Colin\u2014Since this murder has so many fantastic trappings to\ndistract one it must really be very simple.",
    "Did I not\u2019\n\u2018You did\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018But I still don\u2019t see how you can possibly be right.\u2019\n\u2018For that you must wait.",
    "So then we discard the trappings of the crime and we go to the\nessentials.",
    "A man has been killed.",
    "Why has he been killed And who is he The answer to\nthe first question will obviously depend on the answer to the second.",
    "And until you get the\nright answer to these two questions you cannot possibly proceed.",
    "He could be a\nblackmailer or a confidence trickster or somebody\u2019s husband whose existence was\nobnoxious or dangerous to his wife.",
    "He could be one of a dozen things.",
    "The more I heard\nthe more everybody seems to agree that he looked a perfectly ordinary well\u2010to\u2010do\nreputable elderly man.",
    "And suddenly I think to myself \u201cYou say this should be a simple\ncrime Very well make it so.",
    "Let this man be exactly what he seems\u2014a well\u2010to\u2010do\nrespectable elderly man.\u201d\u2019 He looked at the inspector.",
    "\u2018You see\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2014\u2019 said the inspector again and paused politely.",
    "\u2018So here is someone an ordinary pleasant elderly man whose removal is necessary to\nsomeone.",
    "To whom And here at last we can narrow the field a little.",
    "There is local\nknowledge\u2014of Miss Pebmarsh and her habits of the Cavendish Secretarial Bureau of a\ngirl working there called Sheila Webb.",
    "And so I say to my friend Colin \u201cThe neighbours.",
    "Converse with them.",
    "Find out about them.",
    "Their backgrounds.",
    "But above all engage in\nconversation.",
    "Because in conversation you do not get merely the answers to questions\u2014in\nordinary conversational prattle things slip out.",
    "People are on their guard when the subject\nmay be dangerous to them but the moment ordinary talk ensues they relax they\nsuccumb to the relief of speaking the truth which is always very much easier than lying.",
    "And so they let slip one little fact which unbeknown to them makes all the difference.\u2019\n\u2018An admirable exposition\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Unfortunately it didn\u2019t happen in this case.\u2019\n\u2018But mon cher it did.",
    "One little sentence of inestimable importance.\u2019\n217\n\n\f\u2018What\u2019 I demanded.",
    "\u2018Who said it When\u2019\n\u2018In due course mon cher.\u2019\n\u2018You were saying M. Poirot\u2019 The inspector politely drew Poirot back to the subject.",
    "\u2018If you draw a circle round Number 19 anybody within it might have killed Mr Curry.",
    "Mrs\nHemming the Blands the McNaughtons Miss Waterhouse.",
    "But more important still\nthere are those already positioned on the spot.",
    "Miss Pebmarsh who could have killed him\nbefore she went out at 1.35 or thereabouts and Miss Webb who could have arranged to\nmeet him there and killed him before rushing from the house and giving the alarm.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said the inspector.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re coming down to brass tacks now.\u2019\n\u2018And of course\u2019 said Poirot wheeling round \u2018you my dear Colin.",
    "You were also on the\nspot.",
    "Looking for a high number where the low numbers were.\u2019\n\u2018Well really\u2019 I said indignantly.",
    "\u2018What will you say next\u2019\n\u2018Me I say anything\u2019 declared Poirot grandly.",
    "\u2018And yet I am the person who comes and dumps the whole thing in your lap\u2019\n\u2018Murderers are often conceited\u2019 Poirot pointed out.",
    "\u2018And there too it might have amused\nyou\u2014to have a joke like that at my expense.\u2019\n\u2018If you go on you\u2019ll convince me\u2019 I said.",
    "I was beginning to feel uncomfortable.",
    "Poirot turned back to Inspector Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018Here I say to myself must be essentially a simple crime.",
    "The presence of irrelevant\nclocks the advancing of time by an hour the arrangements made so deliberately for the\ndiscovery of the body all these must be set aside for the moment.",
    "They are as is said in\nyour immortal \u201cAlice\u201d like \u201cshoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings\u201d.",
    "The\nvital point is that an ordinary elderly man is dead and that somebody wanted him dead.",
    "If\nwe knew who the dead man was it would give us a pointer to his killer.",
    "If he was a well\u2010\nknown blackmailer then we must look for a man who could be blackmailed.",
    "If he was a\ndetective then we look for a man who has a criminal secret if he is a man of wealth then\nwe look among his heirs.",
    "But if we do not know who the man is\u2014then we have the more\ndifficult task of hunting amongst those in the surrounding circle for a man who has a\nreason to kill.\u2019\n\u2018Setting aside Miss Pebmarsh and Sheila Webb who is there who might not be what they\nseem to be The answer was disappointing.",
    "With the exception of Mr Ramsay who I\nunderstood was not what he seemed to be\u2019 Here Poirot looked inquiringly at me and I\nnodded \u2018everybody\u2019s bona fides were genuine.",
    "Bland was a well\u2010known local builder\n218\n\n\fMcNaughton had had a Chair at Cambridge Mrs Hemming was the widow of a local\nauctioneer the Waterhouses were respectable residents of long standing.",
    "So we come\nback to Mr Curry.",
    "Where did he come from What brought him to 19 Wilbraham\nCrescent And here one very valuable remark was spoken by one of the neighbours Mrs\nHemming.",
    "When told that the dead man did not live at Number 19 she said \u201cOh I see.",
    "He just came there to be killed.",
    "How odd.\u201d She had the gift often possessed by those who\nare too occupied with their own thoughts to pay attention to what others are saying to\ncome to the heart of the problem.",
    "She summed up the whole crime.",
    "Mr Curry came to 19\nWilbraham Crescent to be killed.",
    "It was as simple as that\u2019\n\u2018That remark of hers struck me at the time\u2019 I said.",
    "Poirot took no notice of me.",
    "\u2018\u201cDilly dilly dilly\u2014come and be killed.\u201d Mr Curry came\u2014and he was killed.",
    "But that was\nnot all.",
    "It was important that he should not be identified.",
    "He had no wallet no papers the\ntailor\u2019s marks were removed from his clothes.",
    "But that would not be enough.",
    "The printed\ncard of Curry Insurance Agent was only a temporary measure.",
    "If the man\u2019s identity was\nto be concealed permanently he must be given a false identity.",
    "Sooner or later I was sure\nsomebody would turn up recognize him positively and that would be that.",
    "A brother a\nsister a wife.",
    "It was a wife.",
    "Mrs Rival\u2014and the name alone might have aroused suspicion.",
    "There is a village in Somerset\u2014I have stayed near there with friends\u2014the village of Curry\nRival\u2014Subconsciously without knowing why those two names suggested themselves\nthey were chosen.",
    "Mr Curry\u2014Mrs Rival.\u2019\n\u2018So far\u2014the plan is obvious but what puzzled me was why our murderer took for granted\nthat there would be no real identification.",
    "If the man had no family there are at least\nlandladies servants business associates.",
    "That led me to the next assumption\u2014this man\nwas not known to be missing.",
    "A further assumption was that he was not English and was\nonly visiting this country.",
    "That would tie in with the fact that the dental work done on his\nteeth did not correspond with any dental records here.\u2019\n\u2018I began to have a shadowy picture both of the victim and of the murderer.",
    "No more than\nthat.",
    "The crime was well planned and intelligently carried out\u2014but now there came that\none piece of sheer bad luck that no murderer can foresee.\u2019\n\u2018And what was that\u2019 asked Hardcastle.",
    "Unexpectedly Poirot threw his head back and recited dramatically\n\u2018For want of a nail the shoe was lost\nFor want of a shoe the horse was lost\nFor want of a horse the battle was lost\nFor want of a battle the Kingdom was lost\nAnd all for the want of a horse shoe nail.\u2019\nHe leaned forward.",
    "219\n\n\f\u2018A good many people could have killed Mr Curry.",
    "But only one person could have killed or\ncould have had reason to kill the girl Edna.\u2019\nWe both stared at him.",
    "\u2018Let us consider the Cavendish Secretarial Bureau.",
    "Eight girls work there.",
    "On the 9th of\nSeptember four of those girls were out on assignments some little distance away\u2014that is\nthey were provided with lunch by the clients to whom they had gone.",
    "They were the four\nwho normally took the first lunch period from 12.30 to 1.30.",
    "The remaining four Sheila\nWebb Edna Brent and two girls Janet and Maureen took the second period 1.30 to 2.30.",
    "But on that day Edna Brent had an accident quite soon after leaving the office.",
    "She tore\nthe heel off her shoe in the grating.",
    "She could not walk like that.",
    "She bought some buns\nand came back to the office.\u2019\nPoirot shook an emphatic finger at us.",
    "\u2018We have been told that Edna Brent was worried about something.",
    "She tried to see Sheila\nWebb out of the office but failed.",
    "It has been assumed that that something was\nconnected with Sheila Webb but there is no evidence of that.",
    "She might only have wanted\nto consult Sheila Webb about something that had puzzled her\u2014but if so one thing was\nclear.",
    "She wanted to talk to Sheila Webb away from the bureau.\u2019\n\u2018Her words to the constable at the inquest are the only clue we have as to what was\nworrying her She said something like \u201cI don\u2019t see how what she said can have been true.\u201d\nThree women had given evidence that morning.",
    "Edna could have been referring to Miss\nPebmarsh.",
    "Or as it has been generally assumed she could have been referring to Sheila\nWebb.",
    "But there is a third possibility\u2014she could have been referring to Miss Martindale.\u2019\n\u2018Miss Martindale But her evidence only lasted a few minutes.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly.",
    "It consisted only of the telephone call she had received purporting to be from\nMiss Pebmarsh.\u2019\n\u2018Do you mean that Edna knew that it wasn\u2019t from Miss Pebmarsh\u2019\n\u2018I think it was simpler than that.",
    "I am suggesting that there was no telephone call at all.\u2019\nHe went on \u2018The heel of Edna\u2019s shoe came off.",
    "The grating was quite close to the office.",
    "She came back to the bureau.",
    "But Miss Martindale in her private office did not know that\nEdna had come back.",
    "As far as she knew there was nobody but herself in the bureau.",
    "All\nshe need do was to say a telephone call had come through at 1.49.",
    "Edna does not see the\nsignificance of what she knows at first.",
    "Sheila is called in to Miss Martindale and told to go\nout on an appointment.",
    "How and when that appointment was made is not mentioned to\nEdna.",
    "News of the murder comes through and little by little the story gets more definite.",
    "Miss Pebmarsh rang up and asked for Sheila Webb to be sent.",
    "But Miss Pebmarsh says it\nwas not she who rang up.",
    "The call is said to have come through at ten minutes to two.",
    "But\nEdna knows that couldn\u2019t be true.",
    "No telephone call came through then.",
    "Miss Martindale\nmust have made a mistake\u2014But Miss Martindale definitely doesn\u2019t make mistakes.",
    "The\n220\n\n\fmore Edna thinks about it the more puzzling it is.",
    "She must ask Sheila about it.",
    "Sheila will\nknow.\u2019\n\u2018And then comes the inquest.",
    "And the girls all go to it.",
    "Miss Martindale repeats her story of\nthe telephone call and Edna knows definitely now that the evidence Miss Martindale gives\nso clearly with such precision as to the exact time is untrue.",
    "It was then that she asked\nthe constable if she could speak to the inspector.",
    "I think probably that Miss Martindale\nleaving the Cornmarket in a crowd of people overheard her asking that.",
    "Perhaps by then\nshe had heard the girls chaffing Edna about her shoe accident without realizing what it\ninvolved.",
    "Anyway she followed the girl to Wilbraham Crescent.",
    "Why did Edna go there I\nwonder\u2019\n\u2018Just to stare at the place where it happened I expect\u2019 said Hardcastle with a sigh.",
    "\u2018People\ndo.\u2019\n\u2018Yes that is true enough.",
    "Perhaps Miss Martindale speaks to her there walks with her\ndown the road and Edna plumps out her question.",
    "Miss Martindale acts quickly.",
    "They are\njust by the telephone box.",
    "She says \u201cThis is very important.",
    "You must ring up the police at\nonce.",
    "The number of the police station is so and so.",
    "Ring up and tell them we are both\ncoming there now.\u201d It is second nature for Edna to do what she is told.",
    "She goes in picks\nup the receiver and Miss Martindale comes in behind her pulls the scarf round her neck\nand strangles her.\u2019\n\u2018And nobody saw this\u2019\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018They might have done but they didn\u2019t It was just on one o\u2019clock.",
    "Lunch time.",
    "And what\npeople there were in the Crescent were busy staring at 19.",
    "It was a chance boldly taken by\na bold and unscrupulous woman.\u2019\nHardcastle was shaking his head doubtfully.",
    "\u2018Miss Martindale I don\u2019t see how she can possibly come into it.\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "One does not see at first.",
    "But since Miss Martindale undoubtedly killed Edna\u2014oh\nyes\u2014only she could have killed Edna then she must come into it.",
    "And I begin to suspect\nthat in Miss Martindale we have the Lady Macbeth of this crime a woman who is ruthless\nand unimaginative.\u2019\n\u2018Unimaginative\u2019 queried Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018Oh yes quite unimaginative.",
    "But very efficient.",
    "A good planner.\u2019\n\u2018But why Where\u2019s the motive\u2019\nHercule Poirot looked at me.",
    "He wagged a finger.",
    "221\n\n\f\u2018So the neighbours\u2019 conversation was no use to you eh I found one most illuminating\nsentence.",
    "Do you remember that after talking of living abroad Mrs Bland remarked that\nshe liked living in Crowdean because she had a sister here.",
    "But Mrs Bland was not\nsupposed to have a sister.",
    "She had inherited a large fortune a year ago from a Canadian\ngreat\u2010uncle because she was the only surviving member of his family.\u2019\nHardcastle sat up alertly.",
    "\u2018So you think\u2014\u2019\nPoirot leaned back in his chair and put his fingertips together.",
    "He half closed his eyes and\nspoke dreamily.",
    "\u2018Say you are a man a very ordinary and not too scrupulous man in bad financial\ndifficulties.",
    "A letter comes one day from a firm of lawyers to say that your wife has\ninherited a big fortune from a great\u2010uncle in Canada.",
    "The letter is addressed to Mrs Bland\nand the only difficulty is that the Mrs Bland who receives it is the wrong Mrs Bland\u2014she is\nthe second wife\u2014not the first one\u2014Imagine the chagrin The fury And then an idea\ncomes.",
    "Who is to know that it is the wrong Mrs Bland Nobody in Crowdean knows that\nBland was married before.",
    "His first marriage years ago took place during the war when\nhe was overseas.",
    "Presumably his first wife died soon afterwards and he almost\nimmediately remarried.",
    "He has the original marriage certificate various family papers\nphotographs of Canadian relations now dead\u2014It will be all plain sailing.",
    "Anyway it is\nworth risking.",
    "They risk it and it comes off.",
    "The legal formalities go through.",
    "And there the\nBlands are rich and prosperous all their financial troubles over\u2014\u2018\n\u2018And then\u2014a year later\u2014something happens.",
    "What happens I suggest that someone was\ncoming over from Canada to this country\u2014and that this someone had known the first Mrs\nBland well enough not to be deceived by an impersonation.",
    "He may have been an elderly\nmember of the family attorneys or a close friend of the family\u2014but whoever he was he\nwill know.",
    "Perhaps they thought of ways of avoiding a meeting.",
    "Mrs Bland could feign\nillness she could go abroad\u2014but anything of that kind would only arouse suspicion.",
    "The\nvisitor would insist on seeing the woman he had come over to see\u2014\u2019\n\u2018And so\u2014to murder\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "And here I fancy Mrs Bland\u2019s sister may have been the ruling spirit.",
    "She thought up\nand planned the whole thing.\u2019\n\u2018You are taking it that Miss Martindale and Mrs Bland are sisters\u2019\n\u2018It is the only way things make sense.\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Bland did remind me of someone when I saw her\u2019 said Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018They\u2019re very\ndifferent in manner\u2014but it\u2019s true\u2014there is a likeness.",
    "But how could they hope to get\naway with it\u2019 The man would be missed.",
    "Inquiries would be made\u2014\u2019\n\n222\n\n\f\u2018If this man were travelling abroad\u2014perhaps for pleasure not for business his schedule\nwould be vague.",
    "A letter from one place\u2014a postcard from another\u2014it would be a little\ntime before people wondered why they had not heard from him.",
    "By that time who would\nconnect a man identified and buried as Harry Castleton with a rich Canadian visitor to the\ncountry who has not even been seen in this part of the world If I had been the murderer\nI would have slipped over on a day trip to France or Belgium and discarded the dead man\u2019s\npassport in a train or a tram so that the inquiry would take place from another country.\u2019\nI moved involuntarily and Poirot\u2019s eyes came round to me.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Bland mentioned to me that he had recently taken a day trip to Boulogne\u2014with a blonde\nI understand\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Which would make it quite a natural thing to do.",
    "Doubtless it is a habit of his.\u2019\n\u2018This is still conjecture\u2019 Hardcastle objected.",
    "\u2018But inquiries can be made\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "He took a sheet of hotel notepaper from the rack in front of him and handed it to\nHardcastle.",
    "\u2018If you will write to Mr Enderby at 10 Ennismore Gardens S.W.7 he has promised to make\ncertain inquiries for me in Canada.",
    "He is a well\u2010known international lawyer.\u2019\n\u2018And what about the business of the clocks\u2019\n\u2018Oh The clocks.",
    "Those famous clocks\u2019 Poirot smiled.",
    "\u2018I think you will find that Miss\nMartindale was responsible for them.",
    "Since the crime as I said was a simple crime it was\ndisguised by making it a fantastic one.",
    "That Rosemary clock that Sheila Webb took to be\nrepaired.",
    "Did she lose it in the Bureau of Secretarial Studies Did Miss Martindale take it as\nthe foundation of her rigmarole and was it partly because of that clock that she chose\nSheila as the person to discover the body\u2014\u2019\nHardcastle burst out \u2018And you say this woman is unimaginative When she concocted all\nthis\u2019\n\u2018But she did not concoct it.",
    "That is what is so interesting.",
    "It was all there\u2014waiting for her.",
    "From the very first I detected a pattern\u2014a pattern I knew.",
    "A pattern familiar because I had\njust been reading such patterns.",
    "I have been very fortunate.",
    "As Colin here will tell you I\nattended this week a sale of authors\u2019 manuscripts.",
    "Among them were some of Garry\nGregson\u2019s.",
    "I hardly dared hope.",
    "But luck was with me.",
    "Here\u2014\u2019 Like a conjuror he whipped\nfrom a drawer in the desk two shabby exercise books \u2018\u2014it is all here Among the many\nplots of books he planned to write.",
    "He did not live to write this one\u2014but Miss Martindale\nwho was his secretary knew all about it.",
    "She just lifted it bodily to suit her purpose.\u2019\n223\n\n\f\u2018But the clocks must have meant something originally\u2014in Gregson\u2019s plot I mean.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes.",
    "His clocks were set at one minute past five four minutes past five and seven\nminutes past five.",
    "That was the combination number of a safe 515457.",
    "The safe was\nconcealed behind a reproduction of the Mona Lisa.",
    "Inside the safe\u2019 continued Poirot with\ndistaste \u2018were the Crown jewels of the Russian Royal Family.",
    "Un tas de b\u00eatises the whole\nthing And of course there was a story of kinds\u2014a persecuted girl.",
    "Oh yes it came in very\nhandy for la Martindale.",
    "She just chose her local characters and adapted the story to fit in.",
    "All these flamboyant clues would lead\u2014where Exactly nowhere Ah yes an efficient\nwoman.",
    "One wonders\u2014he left her a legacy\u2014did he not How and of what did he die I\nwonder\u2019\nHardcastle refused to be interested in past history.",
    "He gathered up the exercise books and\ntook the sheet of hotel paper from my hand.",
    "For the last two minutes I had been staring at\nit fascinated.",
    "Hardcastle had scribbled down Enderby\u2019s address without troubling to turn\nthe sheet the right way up.",
    "The hotel address was upside down in the left\u2010hand bottom\ncorner.",
    "Staring at the sheet of paper I knew what a fool I had been.",
    "\u2018Well thank you M. Poirot\u2019 said Hardcastle.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve certainly given us something to think\nabout.",
    "Whether anything will come of it\u2014\u2019\n\u2018I am most delighted if I have been of any assistance.\u2019\nPoirot was playing it modestly.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll have to check various things\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Naturally\u2014naturally\u2014\u2019\nGoodbyes were said.",
    "Hardcastle took his departure.",
    "Poirot turned his attention to me.",
    "His eyebrows rose.",
    "\u2018Eh bien\u2014and what may I ask is biting you\u2014you look like a man who has seen an\napparition.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve seen what a fool I\u2019ve been.\u2019\n\u2018Aha.",
    "Well that happens to many of us.\u2019\nBut presumably not to Hercule Poirot I had to attack him.",
    "\u2018Just tell me one thing Poirot.",
    "If as you said you could do all this sitting in your chair in\nLondon and could have got me and Dick Hardcastle to come to you there why\u2014oh why\ndid you come down here at all\u2019\n224\n\n\f\u2018I told you they make the reparation in my apartment.\u2019\n\u2018They would have lent you another apartment.",
    "Or you could have gone to the Ritz you\nwould have been more comfortable there than in the Curlew Hotel.\u2019\n\u2018Indubitably\u2019 said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u2018The coffee here mon dieu the coffee\u2019\n\u2018Well then why\u2019\nHercule Poirot flew into a rage.",
    "\u2018Eh bien since you are too stupid to guess I will tell you.",
    "I am human am I not I can be\nthe machine if it is necessary.",
    "I can lie back and think.",
    "I can solve the problem so.",
    "But I am\nhuman I tell you.",
    "And the problems concern human beings.\u2019\n\u2018And so\u2019\n\u2018The explanation is as simple as the murder was simple.",
    "I came out of human curiosity\u2019\nsaid Hercule Poirot with an attempt at dignity.",

    "\u2018May I come in and speak to you\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.\u2019\nShe preceded me into the sitting\u2010room.",
    "\u2018You seem to spend a lot of time down here Mr Lamb.",
    "I understood that you were not\nconnected with the local police\u2014\u2019\n\u2018You understood rightly.",
    "I think really you have known exactly who I am from the first day\nyou spoke to me.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure quite what you mean by that.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve been extremely stupid Miss Pebmarsh.",
    "I came to this place to look for you.",
    "I found\nyou the first day I was here\u2014and I didn\u2019t know I had found you\u2019\n\u2018Possibly murder distracted you.\u2019\n\u2018As you say.",
    "I was also stupid enough to look at a piece of paper the wrong way up.\u2019\n\u2018And what is the point of all this\u2019\n\u2018Just that the game is up Miss Pebmarsh.",
    "I\u2019ve found the headquarters where all the\nplanning is done.",
    "Such records and memoranda as are necessary are kept by you on the\nmicro dot system in Braille.",
    "The information Larkin got at Portlebury was passed to you.",

    "I thought it might be like that.\u2019\n\u2018And why are you telling me all this It seems unusual.\u2019\nI looked at my watch.",
