    "\fAt Bertrams Hotel\n\n\n\fChapter 1\nIn the heart of the West End there are many quiet pockets unknown to\nalmost all but taxi drivers who traverse them with expert knowledge and\narrive triumphantly thereby at Park Lane Berkeley Square or South Audley\nStreet.",
    "If you turn off on an unpretentious street from the Park and turn left and\nright once or twice you will find yourself in a quiet street with Bertrams\nHotel on the righthand side.",
    "Bertrams Hotel has been there a long time.",
    "During the war houses were demolished on the right of it and a little farther\ndown on the left of it but Bertrams itself remained unscathed.",
    "Naturally it\ncould not escape being as house agents would say scratched bruised and\nmarked but by the expenditure of only a reasonable amount of money it was\nrestored to its original condition.",
    "By 1955 it looked precisely as it had looked\nin 1939  dignified unostentatious and quietly expensive.",
    "Such was Bertrams patronized over a long stretch of years by the higher\nechelons of the clergy dowager ladies of the aristocracy up from the country\ngirls on their way home for the holidays from expensive finishing schools.",
    "\u201cSo few places where a girl can stay alone in London but of course it is quite\nall right at Bertrams.",
    "We have stayed there for years.\u201d\nThere had of course been many other hotels on the model of Bertrams.",
    "Some still existed but nearly all had felt the wind of change.",
    "They had had\nnecessarily to modernize themselves to cater for a different clientele.",
    "Bertrams too had had to change but it had been done so cleverly that it was\nnot at all apparent at the first casual glance.",
    "Outside the steps that led up to the big swing doors stood what at first\nsight appeared to be no less than a field marshal.",
    "Gold braid and medal\nribbons adorned a broad and manly chest.",
    "His deportment was perfect.",
    "He\nreceived you with tender concern as you emerged with rheumatic difficulty\nfrom a taxi or a car guided you carefully up the steps and piloted you through\nthe silently swinging doorway.",
    "Inside if this was the first time you had visited Bertrams you felt almost\nwith alarm that you had reentered a vanished world.",
    "Time had gone back.",
    "You were in Edwardian England once more.",
    "There was of course central heating but it was not apparent.",
    "As there\nhad always been in the big central lounge there were two magnificent coal\nfires beside them big brass coal scuttles shone in the way they used to shine\nwhen Edwardian housemaids polished them and they were filled with exactly\nthe rightsized lumps of coal.",
    "There was a general appearance of rich red\nvelvet and plushy coziness.",
    "The armchairs were not of this time and age.",
    "They\n\n\fwere well above the level of the floor so that rheumatic old ladies had not to\nstruggle in an undignified manner in order to get to their feet.",
    "The seats of the\nchairs did not as in so many modern highpriced armchairs stop halfway\nbetween the thigh and the knee thereby inflicting agony on those suffering\nfrom arthritis and sciatica and they were not all of a pattern.",
    "There were\nstraight backs and reclining backs different widths to accommodate the\nslender and the obese.",
    "People of almost any dimension could find a\ncomfortable chair at Bertrams.",
    "Since it was now the tea hour the lounge hall was full.",
    "Not that the lounge\nhall was the only place where you could have tea.",
    "There was a drawing room\nchintzy a smoking room by some hidden influence reserved for gentlemen\nonly where the vast chairs were of fine leather two writing rooms where\nyou could take a special friend and have a cozy little gossip in a quiet corner and even write a letter as well if you wanted to.",
    "Besides these amenities of the\nEdwardian age there were other retreats not in any way publicized but\nknown to those who wanted them.",
    "There was a double bar with two bar\nattendants an American barman to make the Americans feel at home and to\nprovide them with bourbon rye and every kind of cocktail and an English\none to deal with sherries and Pimms No.",
    "1 and to talk knowledgeably about\nthe runners at Ascot and Newbury to the middleaged men who stayed at\nBertrams for the more serious race meetings.",
    "There was also tucked down a\npassage in a secretive way a television room for those who asked for it.",
    "But the big entrance lounge was the favourite place for the afternoon tea\ndrinking.",
    "The elderly ladies enjoyed seeing who came in and out recognizing\nold friends and commenting unfavourably on how these had aged.",
    "There\nwere also American visitors fascinated by seeing the titled English really\ngetting down to their traditional afternoon tea.",
    "For afternoon tea was quite a\nfeature of Bertrams.",
    "It was nothing less than splendid.",
    "Presiding over the ritual was Henry a\nlarge and magnificent figure a ripe fifty avuncular sympathetic and with the\ncourtly manners of that long vanished species the perfect butler.",
    "Slim youths\nperformed the actual work under Henrys austere direction.",
    "There were large\ncrested silver trays and Georgian silver teapots.",
    "The china if not actually\nRockingham and Davenport looked like it.",
    "The Blind Earl services were\nparticular favourites.",
    "The tea was the best Indian Ceylon Darjeeling\nLapsang etc.",
    "As for eatables you could ask for anything you liked  and get\nit\nOn this particular day November the 17th Lady Selina Hazy sixtyfive\nup from Leicestershire was eating delicious wellbuttered muffins with all an\nelderly ladys relish.",
    "Her absorption with muffins however was not so great that she failed to\nlook up sharply every time the inner pair of swing doors opened to admit a\n\n\fnewcomer.",
    "So it was that she smiled and nodded to welcome Colonel Luscombe erect soldierly race glasses hanging round his neck.",
    "Like the old autocrat that\nshe was she beckoned imperiously and in a minute or two Luscombe came\nover to her.",
    "\u201cHello Selina what brings you up to Town\u201d\n\u201cDentist\u201d said Lady Selina rather indistinctly owing to muffin.",
    "\u201cAnd I\nthought as I was up I might as well go and see that man in Harley Street\nabout my arthritis.",
    "You know who I mean.\u201d\nAlthough Harley Street contained several hundreds of fashionable\npractitioners for all and every ailment Luscombe did know whom she meant.",
    "\u201cDo you any good\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cI rather think he did\u201d said Lady Selina grudgingly.",
    "\u201cExtraordinary\nfellow.",
    "Took me by the neck when I wasnt expecting it and wrung it like a\nchicken.\u201d She moved her neck gingerly.",
    "\u201cHurt you\u201d\n\u201cIt must have done twisting it like that but really I hadnt time to know.\u201d\nShe continued to move her neck gingerly.",
    "\u201cFeels all right.",
    "Can look over my\nright shoulder for the first time in years.\u201d\nShe put this to a practical test and exclaimed.",
    "\u201cWhy I do believe thats old Jane Marple.",
    "Thought she was dead years\nago.",
    "Looks a hundred.\u201d\nColonel Luscombe threw a glance in the direction of Jane Marple thus\nresurrected but without much interest Bertrams always had a sprinkling of\nwhat he called fluffy old pussies.",
    "Lady Selina was continuing.",
    "\u201cOnly place in London you can still get muffins.",
    "Real muffins.",
    "Do you\nknow when I went to America last year they had something called muffins on\nthe breakfast menu.",
    "Not real muffins at all.",
    "Kind of teacake with raisins in\nthem.",
    "I mean why call them muffins\u201d\nShe pushed in the last buttery morsel and looked round vaguely.",
    "Henry\nmaterialized immediately.",
    "Not quickly or hurriedly.",
    "It seemed that just\nsuddenly he was there.",
    "\u201cAnything further I can get you my lady Cake of any kind\u201d\n\u201cCake\u201d Lady Selina thought about it was doubtful.",
    "\u201cWe are serving very good seed cake my lady.",
    "I can recommend it.\u201d\n\u201cSeed cake I havent eaten seed cake for years.",
    "It is real seed cake\u201d\n\u201cOh yes my lady.",
    "The cook has had the receipt for years.",
    "Youll enjoy it\nIm sure.\u201d\nHenry gave a glance at one of his retinue and the lad departed in search\nof seed cake.",
    "\u201cI suppose youve been at Newbury Derek\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes.",
    "Darned cold I didnt wait for the last two races.",
    "Disastrous day.",
    "That filly of Harrys was no good at all.\u201d\n\u201cDidnt think she would be.",
    "What about Swanhilda\u201d\n\u201cFinished fourth.\u201d Luscombe rose.",
    "\u201cGot to see about my room.\u201d\nHe walked across the lounge to the reception desk.",
    "As he went he noted\nthe tables and their occupants.",
    "Astonishing number of people having tea here.",
    "Quite like old days.",
    "Tea as a meal had rather gone out of fashion since the\nwar.",
    "But evidently not at Bertrams.",
    "Who were all these people Two canons\nand the Dean of Chislehampton.",
    "Yes and another pair of gaitered legs over in\nthe corner a Bishop no less Mere Vicars were scarce.",
    "Have to be at least a\ncanon to afford Bertrams he thought.",
    "The rank and file of the clergy certainly\ncouldnt poor devils.",
    "As far as that went he wondered how on earth people\nlike old Selina Hazy could.",
    "Shed only got twopence or so a year to bless\nherself with.",
    "And there was old Lady Berry and Mrs Posselthwaite from\nSomerset and Sybil Kerr  all poor as church mice.",
    "Still thinking about this he arrived at the desk and was pleasantly greeted\nby Miss Gorringe the receptionist.",
    "Miss Gorringe was an old friend.",
    "She\nknew everyone of the clientele and like royalty never forgot a face.",
    "She\nlooked frumpy but respectable.",
    "Frizzled yellowish hair oldfashioned tongs\nit suggested black silk dress a high bosom on which reposed a large gold\nlocket and a cameo brooch.",
    "\u201cNumber fourteen\u201d said Miss Gorringe.",
    "\u201cI think you had fourteen last\ntime Colonel Luscombe and liked it.",
    "Its quiet.\u201d\n\u201cHow you always manage to remember these things I cant imagine Miss\nGorringe.\u201d\n\u201cWe like to make our old friends comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cTakes me back a long way coming in here.",
    "Nothing seems to have\nchanged.\u201d\nHe broke off as Mr Humfries came out from an inner sanctum to greet\nhim.",
    "Mr Humfries was often taken by the uninitiated to be Mr Bertram in\nperson.",
    "Who the actual Mr Bertram was or indeed if there ever had been a\nMr Bertram was now lost in the mists of antiquity.",
    "Bertrams had existed since\nabout 1840 but nobody had taken any interest in tracing its past history.",
    "It\nwas just there solid a fact.",
    "When addressed as Mr Bertram Mr Humfries\nnever corrected the impression.",
    "If they wanted him to be Mr Bertram he\nwould be Mr Bertram.",
    "Colonel Luscombe knew his name though he didnt\nknow if Humfries was the manager or the owner.",
    "He rather fancied the latter.",
    "Mr Humfries was a man of about fifty.",
    "He had very good manners and\nthe presence of a junior minister.",
    "He could at any moment be all things to all\npeople.",
    "He could talk racing shop cricket foreign politics tell anecdotes of\nroyalty give motor show information knew the most interesting plays on at\n\n\fpresent advise on places Americans ought really to see in England however\nshort their stay.",
    "He had knowledgeable information about where it would suit\npersons of all incomes and tastes to dine.",
    "With all this he did not make\nhimself too cheap.",
    "He was not on tap all the time.",
    "Miss Gorringe had all the\nsame facts at her fingertips and could retail them efficiently.",
    "At brief intervals\nMr Humfries like the sun made his appearance above the horizon and\nflattered someone by his personal attention.",
    "This time it was Colonel Luscombe who was so honoured.",
    "They\nexchanged a few racing platitudes but Colonel Luscombe was absorbed by\nhis problem.",
    "And here was the man who could give him the answer.",
    "\u201cTell me Humfries how do all these old dears manage to come and stay\nhere\u201d\n\u201cOh youve been wondering about that\u201d Mr Humfries seemed amused.",
    "\u201cWell the answers simple.",
    "They couldnt afford it.",
    "Unless \u201d\nHe paused.",
    "\u201cUnless you make special prices for them Is that it\u201d\n\u201cMore or less.",
    "They dont really know usually that they are special prices\nor if they do realize it they think its because theyre old customers.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it isnt just that\u201d\n\u201cWell Colonel Luscombe I am running a hotel.",
    "I couldnt afford actually\nto lose money.\u201d\n\u201cBut how can that pay you\u201d\n\u201cIts a question of atmosphere...",
    "Strangers coming to this country Americans in particular because they are the ones who have the money have their own rather queer ideas of what England is like.",
    "Im not talking you\nunderstand of the rich business tycoons who are always crossing the Atlantic.",
    "They usually go to the Savoy or the Dorchester.",
    "They want modern decor\nAmerican food all the things that will make them feel at home.",
    "But there are\na lot of people who come abroad at rare intervals and who expect this country\nto be  well I wont go back as far as Dickens but theyve read Cranford and\nHenry James and they dont want to find this country just the same as their\nown So they go back home afterwards and say Theres a wonderful place in\nLondon Bertrams Hotel its called.",
    "Its just like stepping back a hundred\nyears.",
    "It just is old England And the people who stay there People youd\nnever come across anywhere else.",
    "Wonderful old duchesses.",
    "They serve all\nthe old English dishes theres a marvellous oldfashioned beefsteak pudding\nYouve never tasted anything like it and great sirloins of beef and saddles of\nmutton and an oldfashioned English tea and a wonderful English breakfast.",
    "And of course all the usual things as well.",
    "And its wonderfully comfortable.",
    "And warm.",
    "Great log fires.\u201d\nMr Humfries ceased his impersonation and permitted himself something\nnearly approaching a grin.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d said Luscombe thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThese people decayed aristocrats\nimpoverished members of the old county families they are all so much mise\nen scene\u201d\nMr Humfries nodded agreement.",
    "\u201cI really wonder no one else has thought of it.",
    "Of course I found Bertrams\nready made so to speak.",
    "All it needed was some rather expensive restoration.",
    "All the people who come here think its something that theyve discovered for\nthemselves that no one else knows about.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose\u201d said Luscombe \u201cthat the restoration was quite expensive\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "The place has got to look Edwardian but its got to have the\nmodern comforts that we take for granted in these days.",
    "Our old dears  if you\nwill forgive me referring to them as that  have got to feel that nothing has\nchanged since the turn of the century and our travelling clients have got to\nfeel they can have period surroundings and still have what they are used to\nhaving at home and cant really live without\u201d\n\u201cBit difficult sometimes\u201d suggested Luscombe.",
    "\u201cNot really.",
    "Take central heating for instance.",
    "Americans require  need I\nshould say  at least ten degrees Fahrenheit higher than English people do.",
    "We\nactually have two quite different sets of bedrooms.",
    "The English we put in one\nlot the Americans in the other.",
    "The rooms all look alike but they are full of\nactual differences  electric razors and showers as well as tubs in some of the\nbathrooms and if you want an American breakfast its there  cereals and\niced orange juice and all  or if you prefer you can have the English\nbreakfast.\u201d\n\u201cEggs and bacon\u201d\n\u201cAs you say  but a good deal more than that if you want it.",
    "Kippers\nkidneys and bacon cold grouse York ham.",
    "Oxford marmalade.\u201d\n\u201cI must remember all that tomorrow morning.",
    "Dont get that sort of thing\nany more at home.\u201d\nHumfries smiled.",
    "\u201cMost gentlemen only ask for eggs and bacon.",
    "Theyve well theyve got out of the way of thinking about the things there used to be.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes...",
    "I remember when I was a child... Sideboards groaning with\nhot dishes.",
    "Yes it was a luxurious way of life.\u201d\n\u201cWe endeavour to give people anything they ask for.\u201d\n\u201cIncluding seed cake and muffins  yes I see.",
    "To each according to his\nneed  I see... Quite Marxian.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon\u201d\n\u201cJust a thought Humfries.",
    "Extremes meet.\u201d\nColonel Luscombe turned away taking the key Miss Gorringe offered\nhim.",
    "A page boy sprang to attention and conducted him to the elevator.",
    "He\nsaw in passing that Lady Selina Hazy was now sitting with her friend Jane\nSomething or other.",
    "OceanofPDF.com\n\n\fAt Bertrams Hotel\nOceanofPDF.com\n\n\fChapter 2\n\u201cAnd I suppose youre still living at that dear St Mary Mead\u201d Lady\nSelina was asking.",
    "\u201cSuch a sweet unspoiled village.",
    "I often think about it.",
    "Just\nthe same as ever I suppose\u201d\n\u201cWell not quite.\u201d Miss Marple reflected on certain aspects of her place of\nresidence.",
    "The new housing developments.",
    "The additions to the Village Hall\nthe altered appearance of the High Street with its uptodate shop fronts... She\nsighed.",
    "\u201cOne has to accept change I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cProgress\u201d said Lady Selina vaguely.",
    "\u201cThough it often seems to me that it\nisnt progress.",
    "All these smart plumbing fixtures they have nowadays.",
    "Every\nshade of colour and superb what they call finish  but do any of them really\npull Or push when theyre that kind.",
    "Every time you go to a friends house\nyou find some kind of a notice in the Loo  Press sharply and release Pull to\nthe left Release quickly.",
    "But in the old days one just pulled up a handle any\nkind of way and cataracts of water came at once.",
    "Theres the dear Bishop of\nMedmenham\u201d Lady Selina broke off to say as a handsome elderly cleric\npassed by.",
    "\u201cPractically quite blind I believe.",
    "But such a splendid militant\npriest.\u201d\nA little clerical talk was indulged in interspersed by Lady Selinas\nrecognition of various friends and acquaintances many of whom were not the\npeople she thought they were.",
    "She and Miss Marple talked a little of \u201cold\ndays\u201d though Miss Marples upbringing of course had been quite different\nfrom Lady Selinas and their reminiscences were mainly confined to the few\nyears when Lady Selina a recent widow of severely straitened means had\ntaken a small house in the village of St Mary Mead during the time her second\nson had been stationed at an airfield nearby.",
    "\u201cDo you always stay here when you come up Jane Odd I havent seen\nyou here before.\u201d\n\u201cOh no indeed.",
    "I couldnt afford to and anyway I hardly ever leave home\nthese days.",
    "No it was a very kind niece of mine who thought it would be a\ntreat for me to have a short visit to London.",
    "Joan is a very kind girl  at least\nperhaps hardly a girl.\u201d Miss Marple reflected with a qualm that Joan must\nnow be close on fifty.",
    "\u201cShe is a painter you know.",
    "Quite a wellknown\npainter.",
    "Joan West.",
    "She had an exhibition not long ago.\u201d\nLady Selina had little interest in painters or indeed in anything artistic.",
    "She regarded writers artists and musicians as a species of clever performing\nanimals she was prepared to feel indulgent towards them but to wonder\nprivately why they wanted to do what they did.",
    "\u201cThis modern stuff I suppose\u201d she said her eyes wandering.",
    "\u201cTheres\n\n\fCicely Longhurst  dyed her hair again I see.\u201d\n\u201cIm afraid dear Joan is rather modern.\u201d\nHere Miss Marple was quite wrong.",
    "Joan West had been modern about\ntwenty years ago but was now regarded by the young arriviste artists as\ncompletely oldfashioned.",
    "Casting a brief glance at Cicely Longhursts hair Miss Marple relapsed\ninto a pleasant remembrance of how kind Joan had been.",
    "Joan had actually\nsaid to her husband \u201cI wish we could do something for poor old Aunt Jane.",
    "She never gets away from home.",
    "Do you think shed like to go to\nBournemouth for a week or two\u201d\n\u201cGood idea\u201d said Raymond West.",
    "His last book was doing very well\nindeed and he felt in a generous mood.",
    "\u201cShe enjoyed her trip to the West Indies I think though it was a pity she\nhad to get mixed up in a murder case.",
    "Quite the wrong thing at her age.\u201d\n\u201cThat sort of thing seems to happen to her.\u201d\nRaymond was very fond of his old aunt and was constantly devising treats\nfor her and sending her books that he thought might interest her.",
    "He was\nsurprised when she often politely declined the treats and though she always\nsaid the books were \u201cso interesting\u201d he sometimes suspected that she had not\nread them.",
    "But then of course her eyes were failing.",
    "In this last he was wrong.",
    "Miss Marple had remarkable eyesight for her\nage and was at this moment taking in everything that was going on round her\nwith keen interest and pleasure.",
    "To Joans proffer of a week or two at one of Bournemouths best hotels\nshe had hesitated murmured \u201cIts very very kind of you my dear but I really\ndont think \u201d\n\u201cBut its good for you Aunt Jane.",
    "Good to get away from home\nsometimes.",
    "It gives you new ideas and new things to think about.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes you are quite right there and I would like a little visit\nsomewhere for a change.",
    "Not perhaps Bournemouth.\u201d\nJoan was slightly surprised.",
    "She had thought Bournemouth would have\nbeen Aunt Janes Mecca.",
    "\u201cEastbourne Or Torquay\u201d\n\u201cWhat I would really like \u201d Miss Marple hesitated.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cI dare say you will think it rather silly of me.\u201d\n\u201cNo Im sure I shant.\u201d Where did the old dear want to go\n\u201cI would really like to go to Bertrams Hotel  in London.\u201d\n\u201cBertrams Hotel\u201d The name was vaguely familiar.",
    "Words came from\nMiss Marple in a rush.",
    "\u201cI stayed there once  when I was fourteen.",
    "With my\nuncle and aunt Uncle Thomas that was he was Canon of Ely.",
    "And Ive never\nforgotten it.",
    "If I could stay there  a week would be quite enough  two weeks\n\n\fmight be too expensive.\u201d\n\u201cOh thats all right.",
    "Of course you shall go.",
    "I ought to have thought that\nyou might want to go to London  the shops and everything.",
    "Well fix it up  if\nBertrams Hotel still exists.",
    "So many hotels have vanished sometimes\nbombed in the war and sometimes just given up.\u201d\n\u201cNo I happen to know Bertrams Hotel is still going.",
    "I had a letter from\nthere  from my American friend Amy McAllister of Boston.",
    "She and her\nhusband were staying there.\u201d\n\u201cGood then Ill go ahead and fix it up.\u201d She added gently \u201cIm afraid you\nmay find its changed a good deal from the days when you knew it.",
    "So dont\nbe disappointed.\u201d\nBut Bertrams Hotel had not changed.",
    "It was just as it had always been.",
    "Quite miraculously so in Miss Marples opinion.",
    "In fact she wondered.",
    "It really seemed too good to be true.",
    "She knew quite well with her usual\ncleareyed common sense that what she wanted was simply to refurbish her\nmemories of the past in their old original colours.",
    "Much of her life had\nperforce to be spent recalling past pleasures.",
    "If you could find someone to\nremember them with that was indeed happiness.",
    "Nowadays that was not easy\nto do she had outlived most of her contemporaries.",
    "But she still sat and\nremembered.",
    "In a queer way it made her come to life again  Jane Marple\nthat pink and white eager young girl...",
    "Such a silly girl in many ways... now\nwho was that very unsuitable young man whose name  oh dear she couldnt\neven remember it now How wise her mother had been to nip that friendship\nso firmly in the bud.",
    "She had come across him years later  and really he was\nquite dreadful At the time she had cried herself to sleep for at least a week\nNowadays of course  she considered nowadays...",
    "These poor young\nthings.",
    "Some of them had mothers but never mothers who seemed to be any\ngood  mothers who were quite incapable of protecting their daughters from\nsilly affairs illegitimate babies and early and unfortunate marriages.",
    "It was\nall very sad.",
    "Her friends voice interrupted these meditations.",
    "\u201cWell I never.",
    "Is it  yes it is  Bess Sedgwick over there Of all the\nunlikely places \u201d\nMiss Marple had been listening with only half an ear to Lady Selinas\ncomments on her surroundings.",
    "She and Miss Marple moved in entirely\ndifferent circles so that Miss Marple had been unable to exchange scandalous\ntidbits about the various friends or acquaintances that Lady Selina recognized\nor thought she recognized.",
    "But Bess Sedgwick was different.",
    "Bess Sedgwick was a name that almost\neveryone in England knew.",
    "For over thirty years now Bess Sedgwick had\nbeen reported by the press as doing this or that outrageous or extraordinary\nthing.",
    "For a good part of the war she had been a member of the French\n\n\fResistance and was said to have six notches on her gun representing dead\nGermans.",
    "She had flown solo across the Atlantic years ago had ridden on\nhorseback across Europe and fetched up at Lake Van.",
    "She had driven racing\ncars had once saved two children from a burning house had several\nmarriages to her credit and discredit and was said to be the second bestdressed woman in Europe.",
    "It was also said that she had successfully smuggled\nherself aboard a nuclear submarine on its test voyage.",
    "It was therefore with the most intense interest that Miss Marple sat up and\nindulged in a frankly avid stare.",
    "Whatever she had expected of Bertrams Hotel it was not to find Bess\nSedgwick there.",

    "Just ideas.",
    "One wants to know what the facts really are.\u201d\n\u201cYoure not thinking of the Mafia  or something like that\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh no.",
    "That would be silly.",

    "It depends on the wording of the trust.",
    "But\nyoure not married so why worry\u201d\nElvira did not reply.",
    "She seemed lost in thought.",
    "Finally she came out of\nher trance and asked\n\u201cDo you ever see my mother\u201d\n\u201cSometimes.",
    "Not very often.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is she now\u201d\n\u201cOh  abroad.\u201d\n\u201cWhere abroad\u201d\n\u201cFrance  Portugal.",

    "He didnt know what to reply.",
    "Was this a moment\nfor truth Or for vagueness Or for a good thumping lie What could you say\nto a girl who asked a question of such simplicity when the answer was of\ngreat complexity\n\u201cI dont know\u201d he said unhappily.",

    "The girl must wonder  clearly was wondering.",
    "Any girl would.",
    "He said \u201cYou mustnt think  I mean its difficult to explain.",
    "Your mother\nis well rather different from \u201d Elvira was nodding energetically.",
    "\u201cI know.",
    "Im always reading about her in the papers.",
    "Shes something\nrather special isnt she In fact shes rather a wonderful person.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d agreed the colonel.",
    "\u201cThats exactly right.",
    "Shes a wonderful\nperson.\u201d He paused and then went on.",
    "\u201cBut a wonderful person is very often\n\u201d He stopped and started again.",
    "\u201cIts not always a happy thing to have a\nwonderful person for a mother.",
    "You can take that from me because its the\ntruth.\u201d\n\u201cYou dont like speaking the truth very much do you But I think what\nyouve just said is the truth.\u201d\nThey both sat staring towards the big brassbound swing doors that led to\nthe world outside.",
    "Suddenly the doors were pushed open with violence  a violence quite\nunusual in Bertrams Hotel  and a young man strode in and went straight\nacross to the desk.",
    "He wore a black leather jacket.",
    "His vitality was such that\nBertrams Hotel took on the atmosphere of a museum by way of contrast.",
    "The\npeople were the dustencrusted relics of a past age.",
    "He bent towards Miss\nGorringe.",
    "\u201cIs Lady Sedgwick staying here\u201d he asked.",
    "Miss Gorringe on this occasion had no welcoming smile.",
    "Her eyes were\nflinty.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d she said.",

    "\u201cI only wanted to be sure this was the right hotel.\u201d There might have been\nsome slight incredulity in his voice as he looked round him then turned back\ntowards the entrance.",
    "His eyes passed indifferently over the people sitting\nround him.",
    "They passed over Luscombe and Elvira in the same way and\nLuscombe felt a sudden unsuspected anger.",
    "Dammit all he thought to\nhimself Elviras a pretty girl.",
    "When I was a young chap Id have noticed a\npretty girl especially among all these fossils.",
    "But the young man seemed to\nhave no interested eyes to spare for pretty girls.",
    "He turned back to the desk\nand asked raising his voice slightly as though to call Miss Gorringes\nattention\n\u201cWhats the telephone number here  1129 isnt it\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Miss Gorringe \u201c3925.\u201d\n\u201cRegent\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Mayfair.\u201d\nHe nodded.",
    "Then swiftly he strode across to the door and passed out\nswinging the doors to behind him with something of the same explosive\nquality he had shown on entering.",
    "Everybody seemed to draw a deep breath to find difficulty in resuming\ntheir interrupted conversations.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Colonel Luscombe rather inadequately as if at a loss for\nwords.",
    "\u201cWell really These young fellows nowadays.\u201d\nElvira was smiling.",
    "\u201cYou recognized him didnt you\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou know who he is\u201d She\nspoke in a slightly awed voice.",
    "She proceeded to enlighten him.",
    "\u201cLadislaus\nMalinowski.\u201d\n\u201cOh that chap.\u201d The name was indeed faintly familiar to Colonel\nLuscombe.",
    "\u201cRacing driver.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "He was world champion two years running.",
    "He had a bad crash a\nyear ago.",
    "Broke lots of things.",
    "But I believe hes driving again now.\u201d She\nraised her head to listen.",
    "\u201cThats a racing car hes driving now.\u201d\nThe roar of the engine had penetrated through to Bertrams Hotel from the\nstreet outside.",
    "Colonel Luscombe perceived that Ladislaus Malinowski was\none of Elviras heroes.",
    "Well he thought to himself better that than one of\nthose pop singers or crooners or longhaired Beatles or whatever they called\nthemselves.",
    "Luscombe was oldfashioned in his views of young men.",
    "The swing doors opened again.",
    "Both Elvira and Colonel Luscombe looked\nat them expectantly but Bertrams Hotel had reverted to normal.",
    "It was merely\na whitehaired elderly cleric who came in.",
    "He stood for a moment looking\nround him with a slightly puzzled air as of one who fails to understand where\nhe was or how he had come there.",
    "Such an experience was no novelty to\nCanon Pennyfather.",
    "It came to him in trains when he did not remember where\nhe had come from where he was going or why It came to him when he was\nwalking along the street it came to him when he found himself sitting on a\ncommittee.",
    "It had come to him before now when he was in his cathedral stall\nand did not know whether he had already preached his sermon or was about\nto do so.",
    "\u201cI believe I know that old boy\u201d said Luscombe peering at him.",
    "\u201cWho is\nhe now Stays here fairly often I believe.",
    "Abercrombie Archdeacon\nAbercrombie  no its not Abercrombie though hes rather like\nAbercrombie.\u201d\nElvira glanced round at Canon Pennyfather without interest.",
    "Compared\nwith a racing driver he had no appeal at all.",
    "She was not interested in\necclesiastics of any kind although since being in Italy she admitted to a mild\nadmiration for cardinals whom she considered as at any rate properly\npicturesque.",
    "Canon Pennyfathers face cleared and he nodded his head appreciatively.",
    "He had recognized where he was.",
    "In Bertrams Hotel of course where he was\ngoing to spend the night on his way to  now where was he on his way to\nChadminster No no he had just come from Chadminster.",

    "Its still there.",
    "In fact weve\nincreased your capital considerably by investments.\u201d\n\u201cHow much will I have\u201d\n\u201cAt the age of twentyone or upon your marriage you will come into a\nsum which at a rough estimate would amount to six or seven hundred\nthousand pounds.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a lot\u201d said Elvira impressed.",
    "\u201cYes it is a lot.",
    "Probably it is because it is such a lot that nobody has ever\ntalked to you about it much.\u201d\nHe watched her as she reflected upon this.",
    "Quite an interesting girl he\nthought.",
    "Looked an unbelievably milkandwater Miss but she was more than\nthat.",
    "A good deal more.",
    "He said with a faintly ironic smile \u201cDoes that satisfy\nyou\u201d\nShe gave him a sudden smile.",
    "\u201cIt ought to oughtnt it\u201d\n\u201cRather better than winning the pools\u201d he suggested.",
    "She nodded but her mind was elsewhere.",
    "Then she came out abruptly\nwith a question.",
    "\u201cWho gets it if I die\u201d\n\u201cAs things stand now it would go to your next of kin.\u201d\n\u201cI mean  I couldnt make a will now could I Not until I was twentyone.",
    "Thats what someone told me.\u201d\n\u201cThey were quite right.\u201d\n\u201cThats really rather annoying.",
    "If I was married and died I suppose my\nhusband would get the money\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I wasnt married my mother would be my next of kin and get it.",

    "How he\n\n\fgets away with it I dont know Fellow isnt a scholar at all.",

    "\u201cWell I didnt really.",

    "You see his room was let\non from the twentythird and when I realized  I didnt at first  that he hadnt\ncome back from Lugano \u201d\n\u201cIve got Lucerne here in my notes\u201d said Campbell.",
    "\u201cYes yes I think it was Lucerne.",

    "The Honourable Mrs Saunders who lives at Lyme Regis.",

    "Do you know her\u201d\n\u201cNot personally no but I have spoken to her on the telephone once or\ntwice.",
    "She is I think a very reliable woman and has been with Canon\nPennyfather for some years.",
    "She was worried naturally.",
    "I believe she and\nArchdeacon Simmons got in touch with near friends and relations but they\nknew nothing of Canon Pennyfathers movements.",
    "And since he was\nexpecting the archdeacon to stay with him it certainly seemed very odd  in\nfact it still does  that the canon should not have returned home.\u201d\n\u201cIs this canon usually as absentminded as that\u201d asked Father.",
    "Miss Gorringe ignored him.",
    "This large man presumably the\naccompanying sergeant seemed to her to be pushing himself forward a little\ntoo much.",
    "\u201cAnd now I understand\u201d continued Miss Gorringe in an annoyed voice\n\u201cand now I understand from Archdeacon Simmons that the canon never even\nwent to this conference in Lucerne.\u201d\n\u201cDid he send any message to say he wouldnt go\u201d\n\u201cI dont think so  not from here.",
    "No telegram of anything like that.",

    "In the baggage room.",
    "If he didnt go to Lucerne have you\nconsidered the possibility of his being run over Something like that\u201d\n\u201cNothing like that has happened to him.\u201d\n\u201cIt really does seem very very curious\u201d said Miss Gorringe a faint\nflicker of interest appearing in her manner to replace the annoyance.",
    "\u201cI mean\nit does make one wonder where he could have gone and why\u201d\nFather looked at her comprehendingly.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYouve only\nbeen thinking of it from the hotel angle.",
    "Very natural.\u201d\n\u201cI understand\u201d said Inspector Campbell referring once more to his notes\n\u201cthat Canon Pennyfather left here about sixthirty on the evening of Thursday\nthe nineteenth.",
    "He had with him a small overnight bag and he left here in a\ntaxi directing the commissionaire to tell the driver to drive to the Athenaeum\nClub.\u201d\nMiss Gorringe nodded her head.",
    "\u201cYes he dined at the Athenaeum Club Archdeacon Simmons told me that that was the place he was last seen.\u201d\nThere was a firmness in Miss Gorringes voice as she transferred the\nresponsibility of seeing the canon last from Bertrams Hotel to the Athenaeum\nClub.",
    "\u201cWell its nice to get the facts straight\u201d said Father in a gentle rumbling\nvoice.",
    "\u201cWeve got em straight now.",

    "bag or whatever hed got with him  it was a blue B.O.A.C.",
    "bag yes He went\noff and he didnt come back and thats that.\u201d\n\u201cSo you see really I cannot help you\u201d said Miss Gorringe showing a\ndisposition to rise to her feet and get back to work.",
    "\u201cIt doesnt seem as if you could help us\u201d said Father \u201cbut someone else\nmight be able to\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cSomeone else\u201d\n\u201cWhy yes\u201d said Father.",
    "\u201cOne of the staff perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cI dont think anyone knows anything or they would certainly have\nreported it to me.\u201d\n\u201cWell perhaps they might.",
    "Perhaps they mightnt.",
    "What I mean is theyd\nhave told you if theyd distinctly known anything.",
    "But I was thinking more of\nsomething he might have said.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of thing\u201d said Miss Gorringe looking perplexed.",
    "\u201cOh just some chance word that might give one a clue.",
    "Something like\nIm going to see an old friend tonight that I havent seen since we met in\nArizona.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Or Im going to stay next week with a niece of\nmine for her daughters confirmation.",
    "With absentminded people you know\nclues like that are a great help.",
    "They show what was in the persons mind.",
    "It\nmay be that after his dinner at the Athenaeum he gets into a taxi and thinks\nNow where am I going and having got  say  the confirmation in his mind \n\n\fthinks hes going off there.\u201d\n\u201cWell I see what you mean\u201d said Miss Gorringe doubtfully.",
    "\u201cIt seems a\nlittle unlikely.\u201d\n\u201cOh one never knows ones luck\u201d said Father cheerfully.",
    "\u201cThen there are\nthe various guests here.",
    "I suppose Canon Pennyfather knew some of them\nsince he came here fairly often.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u201d said Miss Gorringe \u201cLet me see now.",

    "They come from the same part of the world.",
    "Oh yes quite a lot of\npeople.\u201d\n\u201cYou see\u201d said Father \u201che might have talked to one of them.",
    "He might\nhave just mentioned some little thing that would give us a clue.",
    "Is there\nanyone staying here now that the canon knew fairly well\u201d\nMiss Gorringe frowned in thought.",
    "\u201cWell I think General Radley is here\nstill.",
    "And theres an old lady who came up from the country  who used to stay\nhere as a girl so she told me.",
    "Let me see I cant remember her name at the\nmoment but I can find it for you.",
    "Oh yes Miss Marple thats her name.",
    "I\nbelieve she knew him.\u201d\n\u201cWell we could make a start with those two.",

    "\u201cHe never told me.\u201d\nChief Inspector Davy smiled at her.",
    "\u201cYou mean youre not going to tell\nNever mind.",
    "I dare say well be able to find out quite all right without your\nhelp if it should really matter.",
    "But why should you think that this young man\nwho was presumably fond of you should want to kill you\u201d\n\u201cOh because he used to threaten things like that.",
    "I mean we used to have\nrows now and then.",
    "Hed bring some of his friends with him and Id pretend\nto like them better than him and then hed get very very wild and angry.",
    "He\nsaid Id better be careful what I did.",
    "I couldnt give him up just like that That\nif I wasnt faithful to him hed kill me I just thought he was being\nmelodramatic and theatrical.\u201d Elvira smiled suddenly and unexpectedly.",
    "\u201cBut\nit was all rather fun.",
    "I didnt think it was real or serious.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Chief Inspector Davy \u201cI dont think it does seem very likely\nthat a young man such as you describe would really poison chocolates and\nsend them to you.\u201d\n\u201cWell I dont think so really either\u201d said Elvira \u201cbut it must have been\nhim because I cant see that theres anyone else.",
    "It worried me.",

    "Yes\nvery curious.",
    "And it worried you.",
    "You were frightened\u201d\n\u201cYes.",

    "Nobody wants to kill you.",
    "Why should they\u201d\n\u201cThen who shot at me tonight\u201d\n\u201cIn that fog\u201d said Bess Sedgwick \u201cyou might have been mistaken for\nsomeone else.",

    "\u201cYes I think it might be quite possible\u201d said Chief Inspector Davy.",
    "Bess Sedgwick was looking at him very intently.",
    "He almost fancied the\nmotion of her lips saying \u201clater.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d he said cheerfully \u201cwed better get down to some more facts now.",
    "Where had you come from tonight What were you doing walking along\nPond Street on such a foggy evening\u201d\n\u201cI came up for an art class at the Tate this morning.",

    "\u201cAnd then the fog seemed lighter suddenly.",
    "You know how patchy fogs\nare.",

    "I said goodbye to Bridget\nand started off.",

    "I didnt like it very\nmuch.",
    "I ran into a very thick patch of it and I lost my way and I didnt know\nwhere I was.",

    "At first I thought Id go back\nto Bridgets but then I remembered how Id lost my way already.",
    "And then I\nrealized that I was quite close to this nice hotel where Uncle Derek took me\nwhen I came back from Italy and I thought Ill go there and Im sure they can\nfind me a room.",
    "That was fairly easy I found a place to leave the car and then\nI walked back up the street towards the hotel.\u201d\n\u201cDid you meet anyone or did you hear anyone walking near you\u201d\n\u201cIts funny you saying that because I did think I heard someone walking\nbehind me.",
    "Of course there must be lots of people walking about in London.",
    "Only in a fog like this it gives you a nervous feeling.",
    "I waited and listened\nbut I didnt hear any footsteps and I thought Id imagined them.",
    "I was quite\nclose to the hotel by then.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then\u201d\n\u201cAnd then quite suddenly there was a shot.",
    "As I told you it seemed to go\nright past my ear.",
    "The cornmissionaire man who stands outside the hotel came\nrunning down towards me and he pushed me behind him and then  then  the\nother shot came...",
    "He  he fell down and I screamed.\u201d She was shaking now.",

    "\u201cSteady girl\u201d said Bess in a low firm voice.",
