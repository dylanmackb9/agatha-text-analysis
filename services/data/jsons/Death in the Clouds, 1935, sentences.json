    "DEATH IN THE CLOUDS\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nThe September sun beat down hotly on Le Bourget aerodrome as the\npassengers crossed the ground and climbed into the air liner\nPrometheus due to depart for Croydon in a few minutes time.",

    "16.",
    "Some\nof the passengers had already passed on through the center door past\nthe tiny pantry kitchen and the two wash rooms to the front car.",
    "Most\npeople were already seated.",
    "On the opposite side of the gangway\nthere was a good deal of chatter  a rather shrill highpitched womans\nvoice dominating it.",
    "Janes lips twisted slightly.",
    "She knew that\nparticular type of voice so well.",
    "My dear its extraordinary  no idea... Where do you say... Juan les\nPins... Oh yes... No Le Pinet...",
    "Yes just the same old crowd...",
    "But of\ncourse lets sit together... Oh cant we... Who... Oh I see.",
    "And then a mans voice foreign polite\n\nWith the greatest of pleasure madame.",
    "Jane stole a glance out of the corner of her eye.",
    "A little elderly man with large mustaches and an eggshaped head was\npolitely\n\nmoving\n\nhimself\n\nand\n\nhis\n\nbelongings\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nseat\n\ncorresponding to Janes on the opposite side of the gangway.",
    "Jane turned her head slightly and got a view of the two women whose\nunexpected meeting had occasioned this polite action on the\nstrangers part.",
    "The mention of Le Pinet had stimulated her curiosity\nfor Jane also had been at Le Pinet.",
    "She remembered one of the women perfectly  remembered how she\nhad seen her last at the baccarat table her little hands clenching and\nunclenching themselves her delicately madeup Dresdenchina face\nflushing and paling alternately.",
    "With a little effort Jane thought she\ncould have remembered her name.",
    "A friend had mentioned it had\nsaid Shes a peeress she is.",
    "But not one of the proper ones she was\nonly some chorus girl or other.",
    "Deep scorn in the friends voice.",
    "That had been Maisie who had a firstclass job as a masseuse taking off flesh.",
    "The other woman Jane thought in passing was the real thing.",
    "The\nhorsey county type thought Jane and forthwith forgot the two\nwomen and interested herself in the view obtainable through the\nwindow of Le Bourget aerodrome.",
    "Various other machines were\nstanding about.",
    "One of them looked like a big metallic centipede.",
    "The one place she was obstinately determined not to look was straight\nin front of her where on the seat opposite sat a young man.",
    "He was wearing a rather bright periwinkleblue pullover.",
    "Above the\npullover Jane was determined not to look.",
    "If she did she might catch\nhis eye.",
    "And that would never do\n\nMechanics shouted in French the engine roared relaxed roared\nagain obstructions were pulled away the plane started.",
    "Jane caught her breath.",
    "It was only her second flight.",
    "She was still\ncapable of being thrilled.",
    "It looked  it looked as though they must run\ninto that fence thing  no they were off the ground rising rising\nsweeping round there was Le Bourget beneath them.",

    "It contained twentyone\npassengers  ten in the forward carriage eleven in the rear one.",
    "It had\ntwo pilots and two stewards.",
    "The noise of the engines was very\nskillfully deadened.",
    "There was no need to put cotton wool in the ears.",
    "Nevertheless there was enough noise to discourage conversation and\nencourage thought.",
    "As the plane roared above France on its way to the Channel the\npassengers in the rear compartment thought their various thoughts.",
    "Jane Grey thought I wont look at him  I wont.",
    "Its much better not.",
    "Ill go on looking out of the window and thinking.",
    "Ill choose a definite\nthing to think about thats always the best way.",
    "That will keep my mind\nsteady.",
    "Ill begin at the beginning and go all over it.",
    "Resolutely she switched her mind back to what she called the\nbeginning  that purchase of a ticket in the Irish Sweep.",
    "It had been an\nextravagance but an exciting extravagance.",
    "A lot of laughter and teasing chatter in the hairdressing establishment\nin which Jane and five other young ladies were employed\n\nWhatll you do if you win it dear\n\nI know what Id do.",
    "Plans castles in the air a lot of chaff.",
    "Well she hadnt won it  it being the big prize.",
    "But she had won a\nhundred pounds.",
    "A hundred pounds\n\nYou spend half of it dear and keep the other half for a rainy day.",
    "You\nnever know.",
    "Id buy a fur coat if I was you  a real tiptop one.",
    "What about a cruise\n\nJane had wavered at the thought of a cruise but in the end she had\nremained faithful to her first idea.",
    "A week at Le Pinet.",
    "So many of her\nladies had been going to Le Pinet or just come back from Le Pinet.",
    "Jane  her clever fingers patting and manipulating the waves her\ntongue uttering mechanically the usual clich\u00e9s Let me see.",
    "How long\nis it since you had your perm madam...",
    "Your hairs such an\nuncommon color madam... What a wonderful summer it has been\n\n\fhasnt it madam  had thought to herself Why the devil cant I go to\nLe Pinet Well now she could\n\nClothes presented small difficulty.",
    "Jane like most London girls\nemployed in smart places could produce a miraculous effect of\nfashion for a ridiculously small outlay.",
    "Nails makeup and hair were\nbeyond reproach.",
    "Jane went to Le Pinet.",
    "Was it possible that now in her thoughts ten days at Le Pinet had\ndwindled down to one incident\n\nAn incident at the roulette table.",
    "Jane allowed herself a certain amount\neach evening for the pleasures of gambling.",
    "That sum she was\ndetermined not to exceed.",
    "Contrary to the prevalent superstition\nJanes beginners luck had been bad.",
    "This was her fourth evening and\nthe last stake of that evening.",
    "So far she had staked prudently on color\nor on one of the dozens she had won a little but lost more.",
    "Now she\nwaited her stake in her hand.",
    "There were two numbers on which nobody had staked.",
    "Five and six.",
    "Should she put this her last stake on one of those numbers If so\nwhich of them Five or six Which did she feel\n\nFive  five was going to turn up.",

    "Blue eyes.",
    "Crisp short hair.",

    "Was it true She felt a\nlittle muddled herself.",
    "Perhaps she had put her counters on five.",
    "She\nlooked doubtingly at the stranger and he smiled easily back.",
    "Thats right he said.",
    "Leave a thing lying there and somebody else\nwill grab it who has got no right to it.",
    "Thats an old trick.",
    "Then with a friendly little nod of the head he had moved away.",
    "That\ntoo had been nice of him.",
    "She might have suspected otherwise that he\nhad not let her take his winnings in order to scrape acquaintance with\nher.",
    "But he wasnt that kind of man.",
    "He was nice.",
    "And here he was\nsitting opposite to her.",
    "And now it was all over the money spent a last two days  rather\ndisappointing days  in Paris and now home on her return air ticket.",
    "And what next\n\nStop said Jane in her mind.",
    "Dont think of whats going to happen\nnext.",
    "Itll only make you nervous.",
    "The two women had stopped talking.",
    "She looked across the gangway.",
    "The Dresdenchina woman exclaimed\npetulantly examining a broken finger nail.",

    "Ill keep it here.",
    "The maid went out again.",
    "Lady Horbury opened the case and from the\nbeautifully fitted interior she extracted a nail file.",
    "Then she looked long\nand earnestly at her face in a small mirror and touched it up here and\nthere  a little powder more lip salve.",
    "Janes lips curled scornfully her glance traveled farther down the car.",
    "Behind the two women was the little foreigner who had yielded his seat\nto the county woman.",
    "Heavily muffled up in unnecessary mufflers he\nappeared to be fast asleep.",

    "He\nhad a flute case open in front of him and was polishing the flute with\nloving care.",
    "Funny Jane thought he didnt look like a musician  more\nlike a lawyer or a doctor.",
    "Behind these two were a couple of Frenchmen one with a beard and\none much younger  perhaps his son.",
    "They were talking and\ngesticulating in an excited manner.",
    "On her own side of the car Janes view was blocked by the man in the\nblue pullover  the man at whom for some absurd reason she was\ndetermined not to look.",

    "The hell of a mess.",
    "Theres only one way out that I can see.",
    "If\nonly I had the nerve  Can I do it Can I bluff it out My nerves are all to\npieces Thats the coke.",

    "The steward said Excuse me ladies no smoking.",
    "Cicely Horbury said Hell\n\nM. Hercule Poirot thought She is pretty that little one over there.",
    "There is determination in that chin.",
    "Why is she so worried over\nsomething Why is she so determined not to look at the handsome\nyoung man opposite her She is very much aware of him and he of\nher.",

    "Doctor Bryant was glad he himself became neither trainsick\nnor seasick nor airsick.",
    "M. Dupont p\u00e9re turned excitedly in his seat and shouted at M. Dupont\nfils sitting beside him\n\nThere is no doubt about it They are all wrong  the Germans the\nAmericans the English They date the prehistoric pottery all wrong\nTake the Samarra ware \n\nJean Dupont tall fair with a false air of indolence said\n\nYou must take the evidences from all sources.",
    "There is Tall Halaf and\nSakje Geuze \n\nThey prolonged the discussion.",
    "Armand Dupont wrenched open a battered attach\u00e9 case.",
    "Take these Kurdish pipes such as they make today.",
    "The decoration\non them is almost exactly similar to that on the pottery of 5000 b.c.",
    "An eloquent gesture almost swept away the plate that a steward was\nplacing in front of him.",
    "Mr Clancy writer of detective stories rose from his seat behind\nNorman Gale and padded to the end of the car extracted a Continental\nBradshaw from his raincoat pocket and returned with it to work out a\ncomplicated alibi for professional purposes.",
    "Mr Ryder in the seat behind him thought Ill have to keep my end up\nbut its not going to be easy.",
    "I dont see how Im going to raise the dibs\nfor the next dividend.",
    "If we pass the dividend the fats in the fire... Oh\nhell\n\nNorman Gale rose and went to the wash room.",
    "As soon as he had\ngone Jane drew out a mirror and surveyed her face anxiously.",

    "She neither spoke nor thought.",
    "Madame Giselle was dead.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nHenry Mitchell the senior of the two stewards passed swiftly from\ntable to table depositing bills.",
    "In half an hours time they would be at\nCroydon.",
    "He gathered up notes and silver bowed said Thank you\nsir...Thank you madam.",
    "At the table where the two Frenchmen sat\nhe had to wait a minute or two they were so busy discussing and\ngesticulating.",
    "And there wouldnt be much of a tip anyway from them\nhe thought gloomily.",
    "Two of the passengers were asleep  the little\nman with the mustaches and the old woman down at the end.",
    "She was\na good tipper though he remembered her crossing several times.",
    "He\nrefrained therefore from awaking her.",
    "The little man with the mustaches woke up and paid for the bottle of\nmineral water and the thin captains biscuits which was all he had\nhad.",
    "Mitchell left the other passenger as long as possible.",
    "About five\nminutes before they reached Croydon he stood by her side and leaned\nover her.",
    "Pardon madam your bill.",
    "He laid a deferential hand on her shoulder.",
    "She did not wake.",
    "He\nincreased the pressure shaking her gently but the only result was an\nunexpected slumping of the body down in the seat.",
    "Mitchell bent over\nher then straightened up with a white face.",
    "Albert Davis second steward said\n\nCoo You dont mean it.",
    "I tell you its true.",
    "Mitchell was white and shaking.",
    "You sure Henry\n\nDead sure.",
    "At least  well I suppose it might be a fit.",
    "Well be at\nCroydon in a few minutes.",
    "If shes just taken bad \n\nThey remained a minute or two undecided then arranged their course\nof action.",
    "Mitchell returned to the rear car.",
    "He went from table to table\nbending his head and murmuring confidentially\n\nExcuse me sir you dont happen to be a doctor\n\nNorman Gale said Im a dentist.",
    "But if theres anything I can do  He\nhalf rose from his seat.",
    "Im a doctor said Doctor Bryant.",
    "Whats the matter\n\nTheres a lady at the end there  I dont like the look of her.",
    "Bryant rose to his feet and accompanied the steward.",
    "Unnoticed the\nlittle man with the mustaches followed them.",
    "Doctor Bryant bent over the huddled figure in Seat No.",
    "2  the figure of\na stoutish middleaged woman dressed in heavy black.",
    "The doctors examination was brief.",
    "He said Shes dead.",
    "Mitchell said What do you think it was Kind of fit\n\nThat I cant possibly say without a detailed examination.",
    "When did you\nlast see her  alive I mean\n\nMitchell reflected.",
    "She was all right when I brought her coffee along.",
    "When was that\n\nWell it might have been threequarters of an hour ago  about that.",
    "Then when I brought the bill along I thought she was asleep.",
    "Bryant said Shes been dead at least half an hour.",
    "Their consultation was beginning to cause interest heads were\ncraned round looking at them.",
    "Necks were stretched to listen.",
    "I suppose it might have been a kind of fit like suggested Mitchell\nhopefully.",
    "He clung to the theory of a fit.",
    "His wifes sister had fits.",
    "He felt that fits\nwere homely things that any man might understand.",
    "Doctor Bryant had no intention of committing himself.",
    "He merely shook\nhis head with a puzzled expression.",
    "A voice spoke at his elbow  the voice of the muffledup man with the\nmustaches.",
    "There is he said a mark on her neck.",
    "He spoke apologetically with a due sense of speaking to superior\nknowledge.",
    "True said Doctor Bryant.",
    "The womans head lolled over sideways.",
    "There was a minute puncture\nmark on the side of her throat with a circle of red round it.",
    "Pardon the two Duponts joined in.",
    "They had been listening for the\nlast few minutes.",
    "The lady is dead you say and there is a mark on the\nneck\n\nIt was Jean the younger Dupont who spoke\n\n\fMay I make a suggestion There was a wasp flying about.",
    "I killed it.",
    "He exhibited the corpse in his coffee saucer.",
    "Is it not possible that the\npoor lady has died of a wasp sting I have heard such things happen.",
    "It is possible agreed Bryant.",
    "I have known of such cases.",
    "Yes that\nis certainly quite a possible explanation.",
    "Especially if there were any\ncardiac weakness.",
    "Anything Id better do sir asked the steward.",
    "Well be at Croydon\nin a minute.",
    "Quite quite said Doctor Bryant as he moved away a little.",
    "Theres\nnothing to be done.",
    "The  er  body must not be moved steward.",
    "Yes sir I quite understand.",
    "Doctor Bryant prepared to resume his seat and looked in some\nsurprise at the small muffledup foreigner who was standing his\nground.",
    "My dear sir he said the best thing to do is to go back to your seat.",
    "We shall be at Croydon almost immediately.",
    "Thats right sir said the steward.",
    "He raised his voice Please\nresume your seats everybody.",
    "Pardon said the little man.",
    "There is something \n\nSomething\n\n\fMais oui something that has been overlooked.",
    "With the tip of a pointed patentleather shoe he made his meaning\nclear.",
    "The steward and Doctor Bryant followed the action with their\neyes.",
    "They caught the glint of orange and black on the floor half\nconcealed by the edge of the black skirt.",
    "Another wasp said the doctor surprised.",
    "Hercule Poirot went down on his knees.",
    "He took a small pair of\ntweezers from his pocket and used them delicately.",
    "He stood up with\nhis prize.",
    "Yes he said it is very like a wasp but it is not a wasp.",
    "He turned the object about this way and that so that both the doctor\nand the steward could see it clearly  a little knot of teased fluffy silk\norange and black attached to a long peculiarlooking thorn with a\ndiscolored tip.",
    "Good gracious Good gracious me The exclamation came from little\nMr Clancy who had left his seat and was poking his head desperately\nover the stewards shoulder.",
    "Remarkable  really very remarkable absolutely the most remarkable thing I have ever come across in my\nlife.",
    "Well upon my soul I should never have believed it.",
    "Could you make yourself just a little clearer sir asked the steward.",
    "Do you recognize this\n\n\fRecognize it Certainly I recognize it.",
    "Mr Clancy swelled with\npassionate pride and gratification.",
    "This object gentlemen is the\nnative thorn shot from a blowpipe by certain tribes  er  I cannot be\nexactly certain now if it is South African tribes or whether it is the\ninhabitants of Borneo which I have in mind.",
    "But that is undoubtedly a\nnative dart that has been aimed by a blowpipe and I strongly suspect\nthat on the tip \n\n is the famous arrow poison of the South American Indians finished\nHercule Poirot.",
    "And he added Mais enfin Estce que cest possible\n\nIt is certainly very extraordinary said Mr Clancy still full of blissful\nexcitement.",
    "As I say most extraordinary.",
    "I am myself a writer of\ndetective fiction but actually to meet in real life \n\nWords failed him.",
    "The aeroplane heeled slowly over and those people who were\nstanding up staggered a little.",
    "The plane was circling round in its\ndescent to Croydon aerodrome.",
    "Chapter 3\n\nThe steward and the doctor were no longer in charge of the situation.",
    "Their place was usurped by the rather absurdlooking little man in the\n\n\fmuffler.",
    "He spoke with an authority and a certainty of being obeyed\nthat no one thought of questioning.",
    "He whispered to Mitchell and the latter nodded and  pushing his way\nthrough the passengers  he took up his stand in the doorway leading\npast the wash rooms to the front car.",
    "The plane was running along the ground now.",
    "When it finally came to a\nstop Mitchell raised his voice\n\nI must ask you ladies and gentlemen to keep your seats and remain\nhere until somebody in authority takes charge.",
    "I hope you will not be\ndetained long.",
    "The reasonableness of this order was appreciated by most of the\noccupants of the car but one person protested shrilly.",
    "Nonsense cried Lady Horbury angrily.",
    "Dont you know who I am I\ninsist on being allowed to leave at once\n\nVery sorry my lady.",
    "Cant make exceptions.",
    "But its absurd  absolutely absurd.",
    "Cicely tapped her foot angrily.",
    "I\nshall report you to the company.",
    "Its outrageous that we should be shut\nup here with a dead body.",
    "Really my dear Venetia Kerr spoke with her wellbred drawl too\ndevastating but I fancy well have to put up with it.",
    "She herself sat\ndown and drew out a cigarette case.",
    "Can I smoke now steward\n\n\fThe harassed Mitchell said I dont suppose it matters now miss.",
    "He glanced over his shoulder.",
    "Davis had disembarked the passengers\nfrom the front car by the emergency door and had now gone in search\nof orders.",
    "The wait was not a long one but it seemed to the passengers as\nthough half an hour at least had passed before an erect soldierly\nfigure in plain clothes accompanied by a uniformed policeman came\nhurriedly across the aerodrome and climbed into the plane by the door\nthat Mitchell held open.",
    "Now then whats all this demanded the newcomer in brisk official\ntones.",
    "He listened to Mitchell and then to Doctor Bryant and he flung a quick\nglance over the crumpled figure of the dead woman.",
    "He gave an order to the constable and then addressed the\npassengers\n\nWill you please follow me ladies and gentlemen\n\nHe escorted them out of the plane and across the aerodrome but he\ndid not enter the usual customs department.",
    "Instead he brought them\nto a small private room.",
    "I hope not to keep you waiting any longer than is unavoidable ladies\nand gentlemen.",
    "Look here inspector said Mr James Ryder.",
    "I have an important\nbusiness engagement in London.",
    "Sorry sir.",
    "I am Lady Horbury.",
    "I consider it absolutely outrageous that I should\nbe detained in this manner\n\nIm sincerely sorry Lady Horbury.",
    "But you see this is a very serious\nmatter.",
    "It looks like a case of murder.",
    "The arrow poison of the South American Indians murmured Mr\nClancy deliriously a happy smile on his face.",
    "The inspector looked at him suspiciously.",
    "The French archaeologist spoke excitedly in French and the inspector\nreplied to him slowly and carefully in the same language.",
    "Venetia Kerr said All this is a most crashing bore but I suppose you\nhave your duty to do inspector to which that worthy replied Thank\nyou madam in accents of some gratitude.",
    "He went on\n\nIf you ladies and gentlemen will remain here I want a few words with\nDoctor  er  Doctor \n\nBryant my name is.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Just come this way with me doctor.",
    "May I assist at your interview\n\nIt was the little man with the mustaches who spoke.",
    "The inspector turned on him a sharp retort on his lips.",
    "Then his face\nchanged suddenly.",
    "Sorry M. Poirot he said.",
    "Youre so muffled up I didnt recognize\nyou.",
    "Come along by all means.",
    "He held the door open and Bryant and Poirot passed through followed\nby the suspicious glances of the rest of the company.",
    "And why should he be allowed out and we made to stay here cried\nCicely Horbury.",
    "Venetia Kerr sat down resignedly on a bench.",
    "Possibly one of the French police she said.",
    "Or a customs spy.",
    "She lit a cigarette.",
    "Norman Gale said rather diffidently to Jane\n\nI think I saw you at  er  Le Pinet.",
    "I was at Le Pinet.",
    "Norman Gale said Its an awfully attractive place.",
    "I like the pine\ntrees.",
    "Jane said Yes they smell so nice.",
    "And then they both paused for a minute or two uncertain what to say\nnext.",
    "Finally Gale said\n\nI  er  recognized you at once in the plane.",
    "Jane expressed great surprise.",
    "Did you\n\nGale said Do you think that woman was really murdered\n\nI suppose so said Jane.",
    "Its rather thrilling in a way but its rather\nnasty too  and she shuddered a little and Norman Gale moved just a\nlittle nearer in a protective manner.",
    "The Duponts were talking French to each other.",
    "Mr Ryder was making\ncalculations in a little notebook and looking at his watch from time to\ntime.",
    "Cicely Horbury sat with her foot tapping impatiently on the floor.",
    "She lit a cigarette with a shaking hand.",
    "Against the door on the inside leaned a very large blueclad\nimpassivelooking policeman.",
    "In a room near by Inspector Japp was talking to Doctor Bryant and\nHercule Poirot.",
    "Youve got a knack of turning up in the most unexpected places M.\nPoirot.",
    "Isnt Croydon aerodrome a little out of your beat my friend asked\nPoirot.",
    "Ah Im after rather a big bug in the smuggling line.",
    "A bit of luck my\nbeing on the spot.",
    "This is the most amazing business Ive come across\nfor years.",
    "Now then lets get down to it... First of all doctor perhaps\nyoull give me your full name and address.",
    "Roger James Bryant.",
    "I am a specialist on diseases of the ear and\nthroat.",
    "My address is 329 Harley street.",
    "A stolid constable sitting at a table took down these particulars.",
    "Our own surgeons will of course examine the body said Japp but\nwe want you at the inquest doctor.",
    "Quite so quite so.",
    "Can you give us any idea of the time of death\n\nThe woman must have been dead at least half an hour when I\nexamined her  that was a few minutes before we arrived at Croydon.",
    "I\ncant go nearer than that but I understand from the steward that he\nhad spoken to her about an hour before.",
    "Well that narrows it down for all practical purposes.",
    "I suppose its no\ngood asking you if you observed anything of a suspicious nature\n\nThe doctor shook his head.",
    "And me I was asleep said Poirot with deep chagrin.",
    "I suffer almost\nas badly in the air as on the sea.",
    "Always I wrap myself up well and try\nto sleep.",
    "Any idea as to the cause of death doctor\n\nI should not like to say anything definite at this stage.",
    "This is a case\nfor postmortem examination and analysis.",
    "Japp nodded comprehendingly.",
    "Well doctor he said I dont think we need detain you now.",
    "Im\nafraid youll  er  have to go through certain formalities  all the\npassengers will.",
    "We cant make exceptions.",
    "Doctor Bryant smiled.",
    "I should prefer you to make sure that I have no  er  blowpipes or\nother lethal weapons concealed upon my person he said gravely.",
    "Rogers will see to that Japp nodded to his subordinate.",
    "By the way\ndoctor have you any idea what would be likely to be on this \n\n\fHe indicated the discolored thorn which was lying in a small box on\nthe table in front of him.",
    "Doctor Bryant shook his head.",
    "Difficult to say without an analysis.",
    "Curare is the usual poison\nemployed by the South American natives I believe.",
    "Would that do the trick\n\nIt is a very swift and rapid poison.",
    "But not very easy to obtain eh\n\nNot at all easy for a layman.",
    "Then well have to search you extra carefully said Japp who was\nalways fond of his joke... Rogers\n\nThe doctor and the constable left the room together.",
    "Japp tilted back his chair and looked at Poirot.",
    "Rum business this he said.",
    "Bit too sensational to be true.",
    "I mean\nblowpipes and poisoned darts in an aeroplane  well it insults ones\nintelligence.",
    "That my friend is a very profound remark said Poirot.",
    "A couple of my men are searching the plane said Japp.",
    "Weve got a\nfingerprint man and a photographer coming along.",
    "I think wed better\nsee the stewards next.",
    "He strode to the door and gave an order.",
    "The two stewards were\nushered in.",
    "The younger steward had recovered his balance.",
    "He\nlooked more excited than anything else.",
    "The other steward still looked\nwhite and frightened.",
    "Thats all right my lads said Japp.",
    "Sit down.",
    "Got the passports\nthere... Good.",
    "He sorted through them quickly.",
    "Ah here we are.",
    "Marie Morisot French passport.",
    "Know anything\nabout her\n\nIve seen her before.",
    "She crossed to and fro from England fairly\noften said Mitchell.",
    "Ah in business of some kind.",
    "You dont know what her business\nwas\n\nMitchell shook his head.",
    "The younger steward said I remember her\ntoo.",
    "I saw her on the early service  the eight oclock from Paris.",
    "Which of you was the last to see her alive\n\nHim.",
    "The younger steward indicated his companion.",
    "Thats right said Mitchell.",
    "Thats when I took her her coffee.",
    "How was she looking then\n\nCant say I noticed.",
    "I just handed her the sugar and offered her milk\nwhich she refused.",
    "What time was that\n\nWell I couldnt say exactly.",
    "We were over the Channel at the time.",
    "Might have been somewhere about two oclock.",
    "Thereabouts said Albert Davis the other steward.",
    "When did you see her next\n\nWhen I took the bills round.",
    "What time was that\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later.",
    "I thought she was asleep... Crikey\nShe must have been dead then The stewards voice sounded awed.",
    "You didnt see any signs of this  Japp indicated the little wasplike\ndart.",
    "No sir I didnt.",
    "What about you Davis\n\n\fThe last time I saw her was when I was handing the biscuits to go with\nthe cheese.",
    "She was all right then.",
    "What is your system of serving meals asked Poirot.",
    "Do each of you\nserve separate cars\n\nNo sir we work it together.",
    "The soup then the meat and vegetables\nand salad then the sweet and so on.",
    "We usually serve the rear car\nfirst and then go out with a fresh lot of dishes to the front car.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Did this Morisot woman speak to anyone on the plane or show any\nsigns of recognition asked Japp.",
    "Not that I saw sir.",
    "You Davis\n\nNo sir.",
    "Did she leave her seat at all during the journey\n\nI dont think so sir.",
    "Theres nothing you can think of that throws any light on this business\n either of you\n\nBoth the men thought then shook their heads.",
    "Well that will be all for now then.",
    "Ill see you again later.",
    "Henry Mitchell said soberly\n\nIts a nasty thing to happen sir.",
    "I dont like it  me having been in\ncharge so to speak.",
    "Well I cant see that youre to blame in any way said Japp.",
    "Still I\nagree its a nasty thing to happen.",
    "He made a gesture of dismissal.",
    "Poirot leaned forward.",
    "Permit me one little question.",
    "Go ahead M. Poirot.",
    "Did either of you two notice a wasp flying about the plane\n\nBoth men shook their heads.",
    "There was no wasp that I know of said Mitchell.",
    "There was a wasp said Poirot.",
    "We have its dead body on the plate\nof one of the passengers.",
    "Well I didnt see it sir said Mitchell.",
    "No more than did I said Davis.",
    "No matter.",
    "The two stewards left the room.",
    "Japp was running his eye rapidly over\nthe passports.",
    "Got a countess on board he said.",
    "Shes the one whos throwing her\nweight about I suppose.",
    "Better see her first before she goes right off\nthe handle and gets a question asked in the House about the brutal\nmethods of the police.",
    "You will I suppose search very carefully all the baggage  the hand\nbaggage  of the passengers in the rear car of the plane\n\nJapp winked cheerfully.",
    "Why what do you think M. Poirot Weve got to find that blowpipe  if\nthere is a blowpipe and were not all dreaming Seems like a kind of\nnightmare to me.",
    "I suppose that little writer chap hasnt suddenly gone\noff his onion and decided to do one of his crimes in the flesh instead of\non paper This poisoneddart business sounds like him.",
    "Poirot shook his head doubtfully.",
    "Yes continued Japp everybodys got to be searched whether they\nkick up rough or not and every bit of truck they had with them has got\nto be searched too  and thats flat.",
    "A very exact list might be made perhaps suggested Poirot.",
    "A list of\neverything in these peoples possession.",
    "Japp looked at him curiously.",
    "That can be done if you say so M. Poirot.",
    "I dont quite see what youre\ndriving at though.",
    "We know what were looking for.",
    "You may perhaps mon ami.",
    "But I am not so sure.",
    "I look for\nsomething but I know not what it is.",
    "At it again M. Poirot You do like making things difficult dont you\nNow for her ladyship before shes quite ready to scratch my eyes out.",
    "Lady Horbury however was noticeably calmer in her manner.",
    "She\naccepted a chair and answered Japps questions without the least\nhesitation.",
    "She described herself as the wife of the Earl of Horbury\ngave her address as Horbury Chase Sussex and Grosvenor Square\nLondon.",
    "She was returning to London from Le Pinet and Paris.",
    "The\ndeceased woman was quite unknown to her.",
    "She had noticed nothing\nsuspicious during the flight over.",
    "In any case she was facing the other\nway  towards the front of the plane  so had had no opportunity of\nseeing anything that was going on behind her.",
    "She had not left her seat\nduring the journey.",
    "As far as she remembered no one had entered the\nrear car from the front one with the exception of the stewards.",
    "She\ncould not remember exactly but she thought that two of the men\npassengers had left the rear car to go to the wash rooms but she was\nnot sure of this.",
    "She had not observed anyone handling anything that\ncould be likened to a blowpipe.",
    "No  in answer to Poirot  she had not\nnoticed a wasp in the car.",
    "Lady Horbury was dismissed.",
    "She was succeeded by the Honorable\nVenetia Kerr.",
    "Miss Kerrs evidence was much the same as that of her friend.",
    "She\ngave her name as Venetia Anne Kerr and her address as Little\nPaddocks Horbury Sussex.",
    "She herself was returning from the south\nof France.",
    "As far as she was aware she had never seen the deceased\nbefore.",
    "She had noticed nothing suspicious during the journey.",
    "Yes\nshe had seen some of the passengers farther down the car striking at\na wasp.",
    "One of them she thought had killed it.",
    "That was after\nluncheon had been served.",
    "Exit Miss Kerr.",
    "You seem very much interested in that wasp M. Poirot.",
    "The wasp is not so much interesting as suggestive eh\n\nIf you ask me said Japp changing the subject those two\nFrenchmen are the ones in this They were just across the gangway\nfrom the Morisot woman theyre a seedylooking couple and that\nbattered old suitcase of theirs is fairly plastered with outlandish\nforeign labels.",
    "Shouldnt be surprised if theyd been to Borneo or South\nAmerica or whatever it is.",
    "Of course we cant get a line on the motive\nbut I dare say we can get that from Paris.",
    "Well have to get the S\u044bret\u00e9\nto collaborate over this.",
    "Its their job more than ours.",
    "But if you ask me\nthose two toughs are our meat.",
    "Poirots eyes twinkled a little.",
    "What you say is possible certainly but as regards some of your\npoints you are in error my friend.",
    "Those two men are not toughs or\n\n\fcutthroats as you suggest.",
    "They are on the contrary two very\ndistinguished and learned archaeologists.",
    "Go on Youre pulling my leg\n\nNot at all.",
    "I know them by sight perfectly.",
    "They are M. Armand Dupont\nand his son M. Jean Dupont.",
    "They have returned not long ago from\nconducting some very interesting excavations in Persia at a site not far\nfrom Susa.",
    "Go on\n\nJapp made a grab at a passport.",
    "Youre right M. Poirot he said but you must admit they dont look\nup to much do they\n\nThe worlds famous men seldom do I myself  moi qui vous parle  I\nhave before now been taken for a hairdresser\n\nYou dont say so said Japp with a grin.",
    "Well lets have a look at\nyour distinguished archaeologists.",
    "M. Dupont p\u00e8re declared that the deceased was quite unknown to him.",
    "He had noticed nothing of what had happened on the journey over as\nhe had been discussing a very interesting point with his son.",
    "He had\nnot left his seat at all.",
    "Yes he had noticed a wasp towards the end of\nlunch.",
    "His son had killed it.",
    "M. Jean Dupont confirmed this evidence.",
    "He had noticed nothing of\nwhat went on round about him.",
    "The wasp had annoyed him and he had\nkilled it.",
    "What had been the subject of the discussion The prehistoric\npottery of the Near East.",
    "Mr Clancy who came next came in for rather a bad time.",
    "Mr Clancy\nso felt Inspector Japp knew altogether too much about blowpipes and\npoisoned darts.",
    "Have you ever owned a blowpipe yourself\n\nWell I  er  well yes as a matter of fact I have.",
    "Indeed Inspector Japp pounced on the statement.",
    "Little Mr Clancy fairly squeaked with agitation\n\nYou mustnt  er  misunderstand.",
    "My motives are quite innocent.",
    "I can\nexplain \n\nYes sir perhaps you will explain.",
    "Well you see I was writing a book in which the murder was\ncommitted that way.",
    "Indeed.",
    "Again that threatening intonation.",
    "Mr Clancy hurried on\n\n\fIt was all a question of fingerprints  if you understand me.",
    "It was\nnecessary to have an illustration illustrating the point I meant  I mean\nthe fingerprints  the position of them  the position of them on the\nblowpipe if you understand me and having noticed such a thing  in\nthe Charing Cross Road it was  at least two years ago now  and so I\nbought the blowpipe and an artist friend of mine very kindly drew it for\nme with the fingerprints to illustrate my Point.",
    "I can refer you to the\nbook  The Clue of the Scarlet Petal  and my friend too.",
    "Did you keep the blowpipe\n\nWhy yes  why yes I think so  I mean yes I did.",
    "And where is it now\n\nWell I suppose  well it must be somewhere about.",
    "What exactly do you mean by somewhere about Mr Clancy\n\nI mean  well somewhere  I cant say where.",
    "I  I am not a very tidy\nman.",
    "It isnt with you now for instance\n\nCertainly not.",
    "Why I havent seen the thing for nearly six months.",
    "Inspector Japp bent a glance of cold suspicion on him and continued\nhis questions\n\nDid you leave your seat at all in the plane\n\n\fNo certainly not  at least  well yes I did.",
    "Oh you did.",
    "Where did you go\n\nI went to get a Continental Bradshaw out of my raincoat pocket.",
    "The\nraincoat was piled with some rugs and suitcases by the entrance at\nthe end.",
    "So you passed close by the deceaseds seat\n\nNo  at least  well yes I must have done so.",
    "But this was long before\nanything could have happened.",
    "Id only just drunk my soup.",
    "Further questions drew negative answers.",
    "Mr Clancy had noticed\nnothing suspicious.",
    "He had been absorbed in the perfecting of his\ncrossEurope alibi.",
    "Alibi eh said the inspector darkly.",
    "Poirot intervened with a question about wasps.",
    "Yes Mr Clancy had noticed a wasp.",
    "It had attacked him.",
    "He was afraid\nof wasps...",
    "When was this... Just after the steward had brought him\nhis coffee.",
    "He struck at it and it went away.",
    "Mr Clancys name and address were taken and he was allowed to\ndepart which he did with relief on his face.",
    "Looks a bit fishy to me said Japp.",
    "He actually had a blowpipe and\nlook at his manner.",
    "All to pieces.",
    "That is the severity of your official demeanor my good Japp.",
    "Theres nothing for anyone to be afraid of if theyre only telling the\ntruth said the Scotland Yard man austerely.",
    "Poirot looked at him pityingly.",
    "In verity I believe that you yourself honestly believe that.",
    "Of course I do.",
    "Its true.",
    "Now then lets have Norman Gale.",
    "Norman Gale gave his address as Shepherds Avenue Muswell Hill.",
    "By\nprofession he was a dentist.",
    "He was returning from a holiday spent at\nLe Pinet on the French coast.",
    "He had spent a day in Paris looking at\nvarious new types of dental instruments.",
    "He had never seen the deceased and had noticed nothing suspicious\nduring the journey.",
    "In any case he had been facing the other way towards the front car.",
    "He had left his seat once during the journey  to\ngo to the wash room.",
    "He had returned straight to his seat and had\nnever been near the rear end of the car.",
    "He had not noticed any wasp.",
    "After him came James Ryder somewhat on edge and brusque in\nmanner.",
    "He was returning from a business visit to Paris.",
    "He did not\nknow the deceased.",
    "Yes he had occupied the seat immediately in\nfront of hers.",
    "But he could not have seen her without rising and looking\nover the back of his seat.",
    "He had heard nothing  no cry or\nexclamation.",
    "No one had come down the car except the stewards.",
    "Yes\n\n\fthe two Frenchmen had occupied the seats across the gangway from\nhis.",
    "They had talked practically the whole journey.",
    "The younger of the\ntwo had killed a wasp at the conclusion of the meal.",
    "No he hadnt\nnoticed the wasp previously.",
    "He didnt know what a blowpipe was like\nas hed never seen one so he couldnt say if hed seen one on the\njourney or not.",
    "Just as this point there was a tap on the door.",
    "A police constable\nentered subdued triumph in his bearing.",
    "The sergeants just found this sir he said.",
    "Thought youd like to\nhave it at once.",
    "He laid his prize on the table unwrapping it with care from the\nhandkerchief in which it was folded.",
    "No fingerprints sir so far as the sergeant can see but he told me to\nbe careful.",
    "The object thus displayed was an undoubted blowpipe of native\nmanufacture.",
    "Japp drew his breath in sharply.",
    "Good Lord then it is true Upon my soul.",
    "I didnt believe it\n\nMr Ryder leaned forward interestedly.",
    "So thats what the South Americans use is it Read about such\nthings but never seen one.",
    "Well I can answer your question now.",
    "I\ndidnt see anyone handling anything of this type.",
    "Where was it found asked Japp sharply.",
    "Pushed down out of sight behind one of the seats sir.",
    "Which seat\n\nNo.",
    "9.",
    "Very entertaining said Poirot.",
    "Japp turned to him.",
    "Whats entertaining about it\n\nOnly that No.",
    "9 was my seat.",
    "Well that looks a bit odd for you I must say said Mr Ryder.",
    "Japp frowned.",
    "Thank you Mr Ryder that will do.",
    "When Ryder had gone he turned to Poirot with a grin.",
    "This your work old bird\n\n\fMon ami said Poirot with dignity when I commit a murder it will not\nbe with the arrow poison of the South American Indians.",
    "It is a bit low agreed Japp.",
    "But it seems to have worked.",
    "That is what gives one so furiously to think.",
    "Whoever it was must have taken the most stupendous chances.",
    "Yes\nby Jove they must Lord the fellow must have been an absolute\nlunatic.",
    "Who have we got left Only one girl.",
    "Lets have her in and get it\nover.",
    "Jane Grey  sounds like a history book.",
    "She is a pretty girl said Poirot.",
    "Is she you old dog So you werent asleep all the time eh\n\nShe was pretty  and nervous said Poirot.",
    "Nervous eh said Japp alertly.",
    "Oh my dear friend when a girl is nervous it usually means a young\nman not crime.",
    "Oh well I suppose youre right...",
    "Here she is.",
    "Jane answered the questions put to her clearly enough.",
    "Her name was\nJane Grey and she was employed at Messrs. Antoines hairdressing\nestablishment in Bruton Street.",
    "Her home address was 10 Harrogate\nStreet N.W.5.",
    "She was returning to England from Le Pinet.",
    "Le Pinet hm\n\nFurther questions drew the story of the sweep ticket.",
    "Ought to be made illegal those Irish Sweeps growled Japp.",
    "I think theyre marvelous said Jane.",
    "Havent you ever put half a\ncrown on a horse\n\nJapp blushed and looked confused.",
    "The questions were resumed.",
    "Shown the blowpipe Jane denied\nhaving seen it at any time.",
    "She did not know the deceased but had\nnoticed her at Le Bourget.",
    "What made you notice her particularly\n\nBecause she was so frightfully ugly said Jane truthfully.",
    "Nothing else of any value was elicited from her and she was allowed\nto go.",
    "Japp fell back into contemplation of the blowpipe.",
    "It beats me he said.",
    "The crudest detectivestory dodge coming out\ntrumps What have we got to look for now A man whos traveled in the\npart of the world this thing comes from And where exactly does it\ncome from Have to get an expert on to that.",
    "It may be Malayan or\nSouth American or African.",
    "Originally yes said Poirot.",
    "But if you observe closely my friend\nyou will notice a microscopic piece of paper adhering to the pipe.",
    "It\nlooks to me very much like the remains of a tornoff price ticket.",
    "I fancy\nthat this particular specimen has journeyed from the wilds via some\ncurio dealers shop.",
    "That will possibly make our search more easy.",
    "Just one little question.",
    "Ask away.",
    "You will still have that list made  the list of the passengers\nbelongings\n\nWell it isnt quite so vital now but it might as well be done.",
    "Youre\nvery set on that\n\nMais oui I am puzzled  very puzzled.",
    "If I could find something to help\nme \n\nJapp was not listening.",
    "He was examining the torn price ticket.",
    "Clancy let out that he bought a blowpipe.",
    "These detectivestory\nwriters always making the police out to be fools and getting their\nprocedure all wrong.",
    "Why if I were to say the things to my super that\ntheir inspectors say to superintendents I should be thrown out of the\nforce tomorrow on my ear.",
    "Set of ignorant scribblers This is just the\nsort of fool murder that a scribbler of rubbish would think he could get\naway with.",
    "Chapter 4\n\nThe inquest on Marie Morisot was held four days later.",
    "The sensational\nmanner of her death had aroused great public interest and the\ncoroners court was crowded.",
    "The first witness called was a tall elderly Frenchman with a gray\nbeard  Ma\u043etre Alexandre Thibault.",
    "He spoke English slowly and\nprecisely with a slight accent but quite idiomatically.",
    "After the preliminary questions the coroner asked You have viewed\nthe body of the deceased.",
    "Do you recognize it\n\nI do.",
    "It is that of my client Marie Ang\u00e9lique Morisot.",
    "That is the name on the deceaseds passport.",
    "Was she known to the\npublic by another name\n\nYes that of Madame Giselle.",
    "A stir of excitement went round.",
    "Reporters sat with pencils poised.",
    "The\ncoroner said Will you tell us exactly who this Madame Morisot or\nMadame Giselle was\n\nMadame Giselle  to give her her professional name the name under\nwhich she did business  was one of the bestknown money lenders in\nParis.",

    "Did her\nbusiness extend to this country\n\nYes.",
    "Many of her clients were English people.",
    "She was very well\nknown amongst a certain section of English society.",
    "How would you describe that section of society\n\nHer clientele was mostly among the upper and professional classes in cases where it was important that the utmost discretion should be\nobserved.",
    "She had the reputation of being discreet\n\nExtremely discreet.",
    "May I ask if you have an intimate knowledge of  er  her various\nbusiness transactions\n\nNo.",
    "I dealt with her legal business but Madame Giselle was a firstclass woman of business thoroughly capable of attending to her own\naffairs in the most competent manner.",
    "She kept the control of her\nbusiness entirely in her own hands.",
    "She was if I may say so a woman\nof very original character and a wellknown public figure.",
    "To the best of your knowledge was she a rich woman at the time of\nher death\n\nShe was an extremely wealthy woman.",
    "Had she to your knowledge any enemies\n\nNot to my knowledge.",

    "What was the first that you knew of the tragedy\n\nMr Mitchell sir told me that he was afraid something had happened\nto one of the passengers.",
    "Have you ever seen this before\n\nThe blowpipe was handed to Davis.",
    "No sir.",
    "You did not observe it in the hands of any of the passengers\n\nNo sir.",
    "Did anything at all happen on the journey that you think might throw\nlight on this affair\n\nNo sir.",
    "Very good.",
    "You may stand down.",
    "Dr Roger Bryant.",
    "Doctor Bryant gave his name and address and described himself as a\nspecialist in ear and throat diseases.",
    "Will you tell us in your own words Doctor Bryant exactly what\nhappened on Tuesday last the eighteenth\n\nJust before getting into Croydon I was approached by the chief\nsteward.",
    "He asked me if I was a doctor.",
    "On my replying in the\naffirmative he told me that one of the passengers had been taken ill.",
    "I\nrose and went with him.",
    "The woman in question was lying slumped\ndown in her seat.",
    "She had been dead some time.",
    "What length of time in your opinion Doctor Bryant\n\nI should say at least half an hour.",
    "Between half an hour and an hour\nwould be my estimate.",
    "Did you form any theory as to the cause of death\n\nNo.",
    "It would have been impossible to say without a detailed\nexamination.",
    "But you noticed a small puncture on the side of the neck\n\nYes.",
    "Thank you... Dr James Whistler.",
    "Doctor Whistler was a thin scraggy little man.",
    "You are the police surgeon for this district\n\nI am.",
    "Will you give your evidence in your own words\n\nShortly after three oclock on Tuesday last the eighteenth I received\na summons to Croydon aerodrome.",
    "There I was shown the body of a\nmiddleaged woman in one of the seats of the air liner Prometheus.",
    "She was dead and death had occurred I should say about an hour\npreviously.",
    "I noticed a circular puncture on the side of the neck\ndirectly on the jugular vein.",
    "This mark was quite consistent with having\nbeen caused by the sting of a wasp or by the insertion of a thorn which\nwas shown to me.",
    "The body was removed to the mortuary where I was\nable to make a detailed examination.",
    "What conclusions did you come to\n\n\fI came to the conclusion that death was caused by the introduction of\na powerful toxin into the blood stream.",
    "Death was due to acute\nparalysis of the heart and must have been practically instantaneous.",
    "Can you tell us what that toxin was\n\nIt was a toxin I had never come across before.",
    "The reporters listening attentively wrote down Unknown poison.",
    "Thank you... Mr Henry Winterspoon.",
    "Mr Winterspoon was a large dreamylooking man with a benignant\nexpression.",
    "He looked kindly but stupid.",
    "It came as something of a\nshock to learn that he was chief government analyst and an authority\non rare poisons.",
    "The coroner held up the fatal thorn and asked Mr Winterspoon if he\nrecognized it.",
    "I do.",
    "It was sent to me for analysis.",
    "Will you tell us the result of that analysis\n\nCertainly.",
    "I should say that originally the dart had been dipped in a\npreparation of native curare  an arrow poison used by certain tribes.",
    "The reporters wrote with gusto.",
    "You consider then that death may have been due to curare\n\nOh no said Mr Winterspoon.",
    "There was only the faintest trace of\nthe original preparation.",
    "According to my analysis the dart had\nrecently been dipped in the venom of Dispholidus Typus better known\nas the Boomslang or Tree Snake.",
    "A boomslang What is a boomslang\n\nIt is a South African snake  one of the most deadly and poisonous in\nexistence.",
    "Its effect on a human being is not known but some idea of\nthe intense virulence of the venom can be realized when I tell you that\non injecting the venom into a hyena the hyena died before the needle\ncould be withdrawn.",
    "A jackal died as though shot by a gun.",
    "The poison\ncauses acute hemorrhage under the skin and also acts on the heart\nparalyzing its action.",
    "The reporters wrote Extraordinary story.",
    "Snake poison in air drama.",
    "Deadlier than the cobra.",
    "Have you ever known the venom to be used in a case of deliberate\npoisoning\n\nNever.",
    "It is most interesting.",
    "Thank you Mr Winterspoon.",
    "Detective Sergeant Wilson deposed to the finding of the blowpipe\nbehind the cushion of one of the seats.",
    "There were no fingerprints on\n\n\fit.",

    "What\nyou might call the range of it was fairly accurate up to about ten yards.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "There was a little stir of interest but M. Poirots evidence was very\nrestrained.",
    "He had noticed nothing out of the way.",
    "Yes it was he who\nhad found the tiny dart on the floor of the car.",

    "The Countess of Horbury.",
    "The reporters wrote Peers wife gives evidence in air death mystery.",
    "Some of them put in snakepoison mystery.",
    "Those who wrote for womens papers put Lady Horbury wore one of\nthe new collegian hats and fox furs or Lady Horbury who is one of\nthe smartest women in town wore black with one of the new collegian\nhats or Lady Horbury who before her marriage was Miss Cicely\nBland was smartly dressed in black with one of the new hats.",

    "You were sitting in Seat No.",
    "4.",
    "From that seat you had a view of practically everyone in the\ncompartment.",
    "No I hadnt.",
    "I couldnt see any of the people on my side of the thing.",
    "The seats have got high backs.",
    "But if one of those people had stepped out into the gangway into\nsuch a position as to be able to aim the blowpipe at the deceased you\nwould have seen them then\n\nCertainly.",
    "And you saw no such thing\n\nNo.",
    "Did any of the people in front of you move from their seats\n\nWell the man two seats ahead of me got up and went to the washroom compartment.",
    "That was in a direction away from you and from the deceased\n\nYes.",
    "Did he come down the car towards you at all\n\nNo he went straight back to his seat.",

    "You will be heard presently...",
    "Proceed Mr Ryder.",
    "Did you notice if this gentleman had anything in his\nhands\n\nI think he had a fountain pen.",
    "When he came back he had an orangecolored book in his hand.",
    "Is he the only person who came down the car in your direction Did\nyou yourself leave your seat\n\nYes I went to the washroom compartment  and I didnt have any\nblowpipe in my hand either.",

    "And he produced the blowpipe with a triumphant flourish.",
    "The reporters wrote Second blowpipe in court.",
    "The coroner dealt severely with Mr Clancy.",
    "He was told that he was\nhere to assist justice not to rebut totally imaginary charges against\nhimself.",
    "Then he was questioned about the occurrences on the\nPrometheus but with very little result.",
    "Mr Clancy as he explained at\ntotally unnecessary length had been\n\ntoo\n\nbemused with the\n\neccentricities of foreign train services and the difficulties of the\ntwentyfourhour times to have noticed anything at all going on round\nabout him.",

    "There was no getting away from that fact and a very\nterrible and awful one it was.",
    "One of the persons present had been\nlying in a desperate and abandoned manner.",
    "The manner of the crime was one of unparalleled audacity.",
    "In the full\nview often  or twelve counting the stewards  witnesses the\nmurderer had placed a blowpipe to his lips and sent the fatal dart on\nits murderous course through the air and no one had observed the\nact.",
    "It seemed frankly incredible but there was the evidence of the\nblowpipe of the dart found on the floor of the mark on the deceaseds\nneck and of the medical evidence to show that incredible or not it had\nhappened.",
    "In the absence of further evidence incriminating some particular\nperson he could only direct the jury to return a verdict of murder\nagainst a person or persons unknown.",
    "Everyone present had denied\nany knowledge of the deceased woman.",
    "It would be the work of the\npolice to find out how and where a connection lay.",

    "The jury retired.",
    "They returned after five minutes and the foreman\nhanded a piece of paper to the coroner.",
    "Whats all this The coroner frowned.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "I cant accept this\nverdict.",
    "A few minutes later the amended verdict was returned We find that\nthe deceased came to her death by poison there being insufficient\nevidence to show by whom the poison was administered.",

    "The couple turned to look into the twinkling eyes of M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "It was a verdict said the little man of willful murder against me.",
    "Oh surely  cried Jane.",

    "Mais oui.",
    "As I came out I heard one man say to the other That little\nforeigner  mark my words  he done it The jury thought the same.",
    "Jane was uncertain whether to condole or to laugh.",
    "She decided on\nthe latter.",
    "Poirot laughed in sympathy.",

    "Jane and Norman stared after his retreating figure.",
    "What an extraordinarily rum little beggar said Gale.",
    "Calls himself a\ndetective.",
    "I dont see how he could do much detecting.",
    "Any criminal\ncould spot him a mile off.",
    "I dont see how he could disguise himself.",
    "Havent you got a very oldfashioned idea of detectives asked Jane.",
    "All the falsebeard stuff is very out of date.",
    "Nowadays detectives just\nsit and think out a case psychologically.",
    "Rather less strenuous.",
    "Physically perhaps.",
    "But of course you need a cool clear brain.",
    "I see.",
    "A hot muddled one wont do.",
    "They both laughed.",
    "Look here said Gale.",
    "A slight flush rose in his cheeks and he spoke\nrather fast Would you mind  I mean it would be frightfully nice of you\n\n\f its a bit late  but how about having some tea with me I feel comrades in misfortune and \n\nHe stopped.",
    "To himself he said\n\nWhat is the matter with you you fool Cant you ask a girl to have a\ncup of tea without stammering and blushing and making an utter ass of\nyourself What will the girl think of you\n\nGales confusion served to accentuate Janes coolness and selfpossession.",
    "Thank you very much she said.",
    "I would like some tea.",
    "They found a tea shop and a disdainful waitress with a gloomy manner\ntook their order with an air of doubt as of one who might say Dont\nblame me if youre disappointed.",
    "They say we serve teas here but I\nnever heard of it.",
    "The tea shop was nearly empty.",
    "Its emptiness served to emphasize the\nintimacy of tea drinking together.",
    "Jane peeled off her gloves and\nlooked across the table at her companion.",
    "He was attractive  those\nblue eyes and that smile.",
    "And he was nice too.",
    "Its a queer show this murder business said Gale plunging hastily\ninto talk.",
    "He was still not quite free from an absurd feeling of\nembarrassment.",
    "I know said Jane.",
    "Im rather worried about it  from the point of view\nof my job I mean.",
    "I dont know how theyll take it.",
    "Yees.",
    "I hadnt thought of that.",
    "Antoines maynt like to employ a girl whos been mixed up in a murder\ncase and had to give evidence and all that.",
    "People are queer said Norman Gale thoughtfully.",
    "Lifes so  so\nunfair.",
    "A thing like this isnt your fault at all.",
    "He frowned angrily.",
    "Its\ndamnable\n\nWell it hasnt happened yet Jane reminded him.",
    "No good getting\nhot and bothered about something that hasnt happened.",
    "After all I\nsuppose there is some point in it I might be the person who murdered\nher And when youve murdered one person they say you usually\nmurder a lot more and it wouldnt be very comfortable having your\nhair done by a person of that kind.",
    "Anyones only got to look at you to know you couldnt murder\nanybody said Norman gazing at her earnestly.",
    "Im not sure about that said Jane.",
    "Id like to murder some of my\nladies sometimes  if I could be sure Id get away with it Theres one in\nparticular  shes got a voice like a corn crake and she grumbles at\neverything.",
    "I really think sometimes that murdering her would be a\ngood deed and not a crime at all.",
    "So you see Im quite criminally\nminded.",
    "Well you didnt do this particular murder anyway said Gale.",
    "I can\nswear to that.",
    "And I can swear you didnt do it said Jane.",
    "But that wont help you if\nyour patients think you have.",
    "My patients yes.",
    "Gale looked rather thoughtful.",
    "I suppose youre\nright I hadnt really thought of that.",
    "A dentist who might be a homicidal\nmaniac  no its not a very alluring prospect.",
    "He added suddenly and impulsively\n\nI say you dont mind my being a dentist do you\n\nJane raised her eyebrows.",
    "I Mind\n\nWhat I mean is theres always something rather  well comic about a\ndentist.",
    "Somehow its not a romantic profession.",
    "Now a doctor\neveryone takes seriously.",
    "Cheer up said Jane.",
    "A dentist is decidedly a cut above a\nhairdressers assistant.",
    "They laughed and Gale said I feel were going to be friends.",
    "Do you\n\nYes I think I do.",
    "Perhaps youll dine with me one night and we might do a show\n\nThank you.",
    "There was a pause and then Gale said\n\nHow did you like Le Pinet\n\nIt was great fun.",
    "Had you ever been there before\n\nNo you see \n\nJane suddenly confidential came out with the story of the winning\nsweep ticket.",
    "They agreed together on the general romance and\ndesirability of sweeps and deplored the attitude of an unsympathetic\nEnglish government.",
    "Their conversation was interrupted by a young man in a brown suit\nwho had been hovering uncertainly near by for some minutes before\nthey noticed him.",
    "Now however he lifted his hat and addressed Jane with a certain glib\nassurance.",
    "Miss Jane Grey he said.",
    "Yes.",
    "I represent the Weekly Howl Miss Grey.",
    "I wondered if you would care\nto do us a short article on this airdeath murder.",
    "Point of view of one of\nthe passengers.",
    "I think Id rather not thanks.",
    "Oh come now.",
    "Miss Grey.",
    "Wed pay well for it.",
    "How much asked Jane.",
    "Fifty pounds or  well perhaps wed make it a bit more.",
    "Say sixty.",
    "No said Jane.",
    "I dont think I could.",
    "I shouldnt know what to say.",
    "Thats all right said the young man easily.",
    "You neednt actually\nwrite the article you know.",
    "One of our fellows will just ask you for a\nfew suggestions and work the whole thing up for you.",
    "It wont be the\nleast trouble to you.",
    "All the same said Jane Id rather not.",
    "What about a hundred quid Look here I really will make it a hundred.",
    "And give us a photograph.",
    "No said Jane.",
    "I dont like the idea.",
    "So you may as well clear out said Norman Gale.",
    "Miss Grey doesnt\nwant to be worried.",
    "The young man turned to him hopefully.",
    "Mr Gale isnt it he said.",
    "Now look here Mr Gale.",
    "If Miss Grey feels\na bit squeamish about it what about your having a shot Five hundred\nwords.",
    "And well pay you the same as I offered Miss Grey  and thats a\n\n\fgood bargain because a womans account of another womans\nmurder is better news value.",
    "Im offering you a good chance.",
    "I dont want it.",
    "I shant write a word for you.",
    "Itll be good publicity apart from the pay.",
    "Rising professional man brilliant career ahead of you  all your patients will read it.",
    "That said Norman Gale is mostly what Im afraid of\n\nWell you cant get anywhere without publicity in these days.",
    "Possibly but it depends on the kind of publicity.",
    "Im hoping that just\none or two of my patients may not read the papers and may continue in\nignorance of the fact that Ive been mixed up in a murder case.",
    "Now\nyouve had your answer from both of us.",
    "Are you going quietly or have\nI got to kick you out of here\n\nNothing to get annoyed about said the young man quite\nundisturbed by this threat of violence.",
    "Good evening and ring me up\nat the office if you change your mind.",
    "Heres my card.",
    "He made his way cheerfully out of the tea shop thinking to himself as\nhe did so Not too bad.",
    "Made quite a decent interview.",
    "And in truth the next issue of the Weekly Howl had an important\ncolumn on the views of two of the witnesses in the airmurder mystery.",
    "Miss Jane Grey had declared herself too distressed to talk about the\nmatter.",
    "It had been a terrible shock to her and she hated to think about\nit.",
    "Mr Norman Gale had expressed himself at length on the effect upon\n\n\fa professional mans career of being mixed up in a criminal case\nhowever innocently.",
    "Mr Gale had humorously expressed the hope that\nsome of his patients only read the fashion columns and so might not\nsuspect the worst when they came for the ordeal of the chair.",
    "When the young man had departed Jane said\n\nI wonder why he didnt go for the more important people.",
    "Leaves that to his betters probably said Gale grimly.",
    "Hes probably\ntried there and failed.",
    "He sat frowning for a minute or two.",
    "Then he said\n\nJane  Im going to call you Jane you dont mind do you  Jane who\ndo you think really murdered this Giselle woman\n\nI havent the faintest idea.",
    "Have you thought about it Really thought about it\n\nWell no I dont suppose I have.",
    "Ive been thinking about my own part\nin it and worrying a little.",
    "I havent really wondered seriously which which of the others did it.",
    "I dont think Id realized until today that one\nof them must have done it.",
    "Yes the coroner put it very plainly.",
    "I know I didnt do it and I know you\ndidnt do it because  well because I was watching you most of the\ntime.",
    "Yes said Jane.",
    "I know you didnt do it  for the same reason.",
    "And of\ncourse I know I didnt do it myself So it must have been one of the\nothers  but I dont know which.",
    "I havent the slightest idea.",
    "Have you\n\nNo.",
    "Norman Gale looked very thoughtful.",
    "He seemed to be puzzling out\nsome train of thought.",
    "Jane went on\n\nI dont see how we can have the least idea either.",
    "I mean we didnt\nsee anything  at least I didnt.",
    "Did you\n\nGale shook his head.",
    "Not a thing.",
    "Thats what seems so frightfully odd.",
    "I dare say you wouldnt have\nseen anything.",
    "You werent facing that way.",
    "But I was.",
    "I was looking\nright along the middle.",
    "I mean I could have been \n\nJane stopped and flushed.",
    "She was remembering that her eyes had\nbeen mostly fixed on a periwinkleblue pullover and that her mind far\nfrom being receptive to what was going on around her had been\nmainly concerned with the personality of the human being inside the\nperiwinkleblue pullover.",
    "Norman Gale thought\n\nI wonder what makes her blush like that... Shes wonderful... Im going\nto marry her.",
    "Yes I am...",
    "But its no good looking too far ahead.",
    "Ive got\n\n\fto have some good excuse for seeing her often.",
    "This murder business\nwill do as well as anything else...",
    "Besides I really think it would be as\nwell to do something  that whippersnapper of a reporter and his\npublicity \n\nAloud he said\n\nLets think about it now.",
    "Who killed her Lets go over all the people.",
    "The stewards\n\nNo said Jane.",
    "I agree.",
    "The women across the aisle from us\n\nI dont suppose anyone like Lady Horbury would go killing people.",
    "And the other one  Miss Kerr  well shes far too county.",
    "She wouldnt\nkill an old Frenchwoman Im sure.",
    "Only an unpopular M.F.H.",
    "I expect youre not far wrong Jane.",
    "Then\ntheres mustachios but he seems according to the coroners jury to\nbe the most likely person so that washes him out.",
    "The doctor That\ndoesnt seem very likely either.",
    "If hed wanted to kill her he could have used something quite\nuntraceable and nobody would ever have known.",
    "Yees said Norman doubtfully.",
    "These untraceable tasteless\nodorless poisons are very convenient but Im a bit doubtful if they\nreally exist.",
    "What about the little man who owned up to having a\nblowpipe\n\n\fThats rather suspicious.",
    "But he seemed a very nice little man and he\nneednt have said he had a blowpipe so that looks as though he were\nall right.",
    "Then theres Jameson  no whats his name  Ryder.",
    "Yes it might be him.",
    "And the two Frenchmen\n\nThats the most likely of all.",
    "Theyve been to queer places.",
    "And of\ncourse they may have had some reason we know nothing about.",
    "I\nthought the younger one looked very unhappy and worried.",
    "You probably would be worried if youd commited a murder said\nNorman Gale grimly.",
    "He looked nice though said Jane.",
    "And the old father was rather a\ndear.",
    "I hope it isnt them.",
    "We dont seem to be getting on very fast said Norman Gale.",
    "I dont see how we can get on without knowing a lot of things about\nthe old woman who was murdered.",
    "Enemies and who inherits her\nmoney and all that.",
    "Norman Gale said thoughtfully\n\nYou think this is mere idle speculation\n\n\fJane said coolly Isnt it\n\nNot quite.",
    "Gale hesitated then went on slowly I have a feeling it\nmay be useful.",
    "Jane looked at him inquiringly.",
    "Murder said Norman Gale doesnt concern the victim and the\nguilty only.",
    "It affects the innocent too.",
    "You and I are innocent but the\nshadow of murder has touched us.",
    "We dont know how that shadow is\ngoing to affect our lives.",
    "Jane was a person of cool common sense but she shivered suddenly.",
    "Dont she said.",
    "You make me feel afraid.",
    "Im a little afraid myself said Gale.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nHercule Poirot rejoined his friend Inspector Japp.",
    "The latter had a\ngrin on his face.",
    "Hullo old boy he said.",
    "Youve had a pretty near squeak of being\nlocked up in a police cell.",
    "I fear said Poirot gravely that such an occurrence might have\ndamaged me professionally.",
    "Well said Japp with a grin detectives do turn out to be criminals\nsometimes  in storybooks.",
    "A tall thin man with an intelligent melancholy face joined them and\nJapp introduced him.",
    "This is Monsieur Fournier of the S\u044bret\u00e9.",
    "He has come over to\ncollaborate with us about this business.",
    "I think I have had the pleasure of meeting you once some years ago\nM. Poirot said Fournier bowing and shaking hands.",
    "I have also\nheard of you from M. Giraud.",
    "A very faint smile seemed to hover on his lips.",
    "And Poirot who could\nwell imagine the terms in which Giraud  whom he himself had been in\nthe habit of referring to disparagingly as the human foxhound  had\nspoken of him permitted himself a small discreet smile in reply.",
    "I suggest said Poirot that both you gentlemen should dine with me\nat my rooms.",
    "I have already invited Ma\u043etre Thibault.",
    "That is if you and\nmy friend Japp do not object to my collaboration.",
    "Thats all right old cock said Japp slapping him heartily on the\nback.",
    "Youre in on this on the ground floor.",
    "We\n\nshall\n\nbe\n\nindeed\n\nhonored\n\nmurmured\n\nthe\n\nFrenchman\n\nceremoniously.",
    "You see said Poirot as I said to a very charming young lady just\nnow I am anxious to clear my character.",
    "That jury certainly didnt like the look of you agreed Japp with a\nrenewal of his grin.",
    "Best joke Ive heard for a long time.",
    "By common consent no mention of the case was made during the very\nexcellent meal which the little Belgian provided for his friends.",
    "After all it is possible to eat well in England murmured Fournier\nappreciatively as he made delicate use of a thoughtfully provided\ntoothpick.",
    "A delicious meal M. Poirot said Thibault.",
    "Bit Frenchified but damn good pronounced Japp.",
    "A meal should always lie lightly on the estomac said Poirot.",
    "It\nshould not be so heavy as to paralyze thought.",
    "I cant say my stomach ever gives me much trouble said Japp.",
    "But I\nwont argue the point.",
    "Well wed better get down to business.",
    "I know\nthat M. Thibault has got an appointment this evening so I suggest that\nwe should start by consulting him on any point that seems likely to be\nuseful.",
    "I am your service gentlemen.",
    "Naturally I can speak more freely here\nthan in a coroners court.",
    "I had a hurried conversation with Inspector\nJapp before the inquest and he indicated a policy of reticence  the\nbare necessary facts.",
    "Quite right said Japp.",
    "Dont ever spill the beans too soon.",
    "But now\nlets hear all you can tell us of this Giselle woman.",
    "To speak the truth I know very little.",
    "I know her as the world knew her\n as a public character.",
    "Of her private life as an individual I know very\nlittle.",
    "Probably M. Fournier here can tell you more than I can.",
    "But I will\nsay to you this Madame Giselle was what you call in this country a\ncharacter.",
    "She was unique.",
    "Of her antecedents nothing is known.",
    "I\nhave an idea that as a young woman she was goodlooking.",
    "I believe\nthat as a result of smallpox she lost her looks.",
    "She was  I am giving\nyou my impressions  a woman who enjoyed power  she had power.",
    "She was a keen woman of business.",
    "She was the type of hardheaded\nFrenchwoman who would never allow sentiment to affect her business\ninterests but she had the reputation of carrying on her profession with\nscrupulous honesty.",
    "He looked for assent to Fournier.",
    "That gentleman nodded his dark\nmelancholic head.",
    "Yes he said she was honest according to her lights.",
    "Yet the law\ncould have called her to account if only evidence had been\nforthcoming but that  He shrugged his shoulders despondently.",
    "It is\ntoo much to ask  with human nature what it is.",
    "You mean\n\n\fChantage.",
    "Blackmail echoed Japp.",
    "Yes blackmail of a peculiar and specialized kind.",
    "It was Madame\nGiselles custom to lend money on what I think you call in this country\nnote of hand alone.",
    "She used her discretion as to the sums she lent\nand the methods of repayment but I may tell you that she had her own\nmethods of getting paid.",
    "Poirot leaned forward interestedly.",
    "As Ma\u043etre Thibault said today Madame Giselles clientele lay\namongst the upper and professional classes.",
    "Those classes are\nparticularly vulnerable to the force of public opinion.",
    "Madame Giselle\nhad her own intelligence service.",
    "It was her custom before lending\nmoney  that is in the case of a large sum  to collect as many facts as\npossible about the client in question and her intelligence system I\nmay say was an extraordinarily good one.",
    "I will echo what our friend\nhas said  according to her lights Madame Giselle was scrupulously\nhonest.",
    "She kept faith with those who kept faith with her.",
    "I honestly\nbelieve that she has never made use of her secret knowledge to obtain\nmoney from anyone unless that money was already owed to her.",
    "You mean said Poirot that this secret knowledge was her form of\nsecurity\n\nExactly.",
    "And in using it she was perfectly ruthless and deaf to any\nfiner shades of feeling.",
    "And I will tell you this gentlemen Her system\n\n\fpaid Very very rarely did she have to write off a bad debt.",
    "A man or\nwoman in a prominent position would go to desperate lengths to obtain\nthe money which would obviate a public scandal.",
    "As I say we knew of\nher activities but as for prosecution  he shrugged his shoulders that is a more difficult matter.",
    "Human nature is human nature.",
    "And supposing said Poirot that she did as you say happened\noccasionally have to write off a bad debt What then\n\nIn that case said Fournier slowly the information she held was\npublished or was given to the person concerned in the matter.",
    "There was a moments silence.",
    "Then Poirot said\n\nFinancially that did not benefit her\n\nNo said Fournier.",
    "Not directly that is.",
    "But indirectly\n\nIndirectly said Japp it made the others pay up eh\n\nExactly said Fournier.",
    "It was valuable for what you call the moral\neffect.",
    "Immoral effect I should call it said Japp.",
    "Well  he rubbed his nose\nthoughtfully  it opens up a very pretty line in motives for murder  a\nvery pretty line.",
    "Then theres the question of who is going to come into\nher money.",
    "He appealed to Thibault.",
    "Can you help us there at all\n\n\fThere was a daughter said the lawyer.",
    "She did not live with her\nmother indeed I fancy that her mother has never seen her since she\nwas a tiny child.",
    "But she made a will many years ago now leaving\neverything with the exception of a small legacy to her maid to her\ndaughter Anne Morisot.",
    "As far as I know she has never made\nanother.",
    "And her fortune is large asked Poirot.",
    "The lawyer shrugged his shoulders.",
    "At a guess eight or nine million francs.",
    "Poirot pursed his lips to a whistle.",
    "Japp said Lord she didnt look it\nLet me see.",
    "Whats the exchange  thats  why that must be well over\na hundred thousand pounds Whew\n\nMademoiselle Anne Morisot will be a very wealthy young woman\nsaid Poirot.",
    "Just as well she wasnt on that plane said Japp dryly.",
    "She might\nhave been suspected of bumping off her mother to get the dibs.",
    "How\nold would she be\n\nI really cannot say.",
    "I should imagine about twentyfour or five.",
    "Well there doesnt seem anything to connect her with the crime.",
    "Well\nhave to get down to this blackmailing business.",
    "Everyone on that plane\ndenies knowing Madame Giselle.",
    "One of them is lying.",
    "Weve got to find\n\n\fout which.",
    "An examination of her private papers might help eh\nFournier\n\nMy friend said the Frenchman immediately the news came\nthrough after I had conversed with Scotland Yard on the telephone I\nwent straight to her house.",
    "There was a safe there containing papers.",
    "All those papers had been burned.",
    "Burned Who by Why\n\nMadame Giselle had a confidential maid \u00c9lise.",
    "\u00c9lise had instructions\nin the event of anything happening to her mistress to open the safe\nthe combination of which she knew and burn the contents.",
    "What But thats amazing Japp stared.",
    "You see said Fournier Madame Giselle had her own code.",
    "She kept\nfaith with those who kept faith with her.",
    "She gave her promise to her\nclients that she would deal honestly with them.",
    "She was ruthless but\nshe was also a woman of her word.",
    "Japp shook his head dumbly.",
    "The four men were silent ruminating on\nthe strange character of the dead woman.",
    "Ma\u043etre Thibault rose.",
    "I must leave you messieurs.",
    "I have to keep an appointment.",
    "If there is\nany further information I can give you at any time you know my\naddress.",
    "He shook hands with them ceremoniously and left the apartment.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nWith the departure of Ma\u043etre Thibault the three men drew their chairs\na little closer to the table.",
    "Now then said Japp lets get down to it.",
    "He unscrewed the cap of\nhis fountain pen.",
    "There were eleven passengers in that Plane  in rear\ncar I mean  the other doesnt come into it  eleven passengers and\ntwo stewards  thats thirteen people weve got.",
    "One of those thirteen\ndid the old woman in.",
    "Some of the passengers were English some\nwere French.",
    "The latter I shall hand over to M. Fournier.",
    "The English\nones Ill take on.",
    "Then there are inquiries to be made in Paris  thats\nyour job too Fournier.",
    "And not only in Paris said Fournier.",
    "In the summer Giselle did a lot\nof business at the French watering places  Deasuville Le Pinet\nWimereux.",
    "She went down south too to Antibes and Nice and all\nthose places.",
    "A good point  one or two of the people in the Prometheus mentioned\nLe Pinet I remember.",
    "Well thats one line.",
    "Then weve got to get down\nto the actual murder itself  prove who could possibly be in a position\nto use that blowpipe He unrolled a sketch plan of the aeroplane and\nplaced it in the center of the table.",
    "Now then were ready for the\npreliminary work.",
    "And to begin with lets go through the people one by\n\n\fone and decide on the probabilities and  even more important  the\npossibilities.",
    "To begin with we can eliminate M. Poirot here.",
    "That brings the\nnumber down to eleven.",
    "Poirot shook his head sadly.",
    "You are of too trustful a nature my friend.",
    "You should trust nobody nobody at all.",
    "Well well leave you in if you like said Japp goodtemperedly.",
    "Then\nthere are the stewards.",
    "Seems to me very unlikely it should be either of\nthem from the probability point of view.",
    "Theyre not likely to have\nborrowed money on a grand scale and theyve both got a good record\n decent sober men both of them.",
    "It would surprise me very much if\neither of them had anything to do with this.",
    "On the other hand from the\npossibility point of view weve got to include them.",
    "They were up and\ndown the car.",
    "They could actually have taken up a position from which\nthey could have used the blowpipe  from the right angle I mean though I dont believe that a steward could shoot a poisoned dart out\nof a blowpipe in a car full of people without someone noticing him do it.",
    "I know by experience that most people are blind as bats but there are\nlimits.",
    "Of course in a way the same thing applies to every blessed\nperson.",
    "It was madness  absolute madness  to commit a crime that\nway.",
    "Only about a chance in a hundred that it would come off without\nbeing spotted.",
    "The fellow that did it must have had the luck of the devil.",
    "Of all the damn fool ways to commit a murder \n\n\fPoirot who had been sitting with his eyes down smoking quietly\ninterposed a question\n\nYou think it was a foolish way of committing a murder yes\n\nOf course it was.",
    "It was absolute madness.",
    "And yet it succeeded.",
    "We sit here we three we talk about it but we\nhave no knowledge of who committed the crime That is success\n\nThats pure luck argued Japp.",
    "The murderer ought to have been\nspotted five or six times over.",
    "Poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.",
    "Fournier looked at him curiously.",
    "What is it that is in your mind M. Poirot\n\nMon ami said Poirot my point is this An affair must be judged by its\nresults.",
    "This affair has succeeded.",
    "That is my point.",
    "And yet said the Frenchman thoughtfully it seems almost a\nmiracle.",
    "Miracle or no miracle there it is said Japp.",
    "Weve got the medical\nevidence weve got the weapon  and if anyone had told me a week\nago that I should be investigating a crime where a woman was killed\nwith a poisoned dart with snake venom on it  well Id have laughed in\nhis face Its an insult  thats what this murder is  an insult.",
    "He breathed deeply.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "It is perhaps a murder committed by a person with a perverted\nsense of humor said Fournier thoughtfully.",
    "It is most important in a\ncrime to get an idea of the psychology of the murderer.",
    "Japp snorted slightly at the word psychology which he disliked and\nmistrusted.",
    "Thats the sort of stuff M. Poirot likes to hear he said.",
    "I am very interested yes in what you both say.",
    "You dont doubt that she was killed that way I suppose Japp asked\nhim suspiciously.",
    "I know your tortuous mind.",
    "No no my friend.",
    "My mind is quite at ease on that point.",
    "The poisoned\nthorn that I picked up was the cause of death  that is quite certain.",
    "But nevertheless there are points about this case \n\nHe paused shaking his head perplexedly.",
    "Japp went on\n\nWell we get back to our Irish stew we cant wash out the stewards\nabsolutely but I think myself its very unlikely that either of them had\nanything to do with it.",
    "Do you agree M. Poirot\n\n\fOh you remember what I said.",
    "Me I would not wash out  what a term\nmon Dieu  anybody at this stage.",
    "Have it your own way.",
    "Now the passengers.",
    "Lets start up at the end\nby the stewards pantry and the wash rooms.",
    "Seat No.",
    "16.",
    "He jabbed\na pencil on the plan.",
    "Thats the hairdressing girl Jane Grey.",
    "Got a\nticket in the Irish Sweep  blewed it at Le Pinet.",
    "That means the girls a\ngambler.",
    "She might have been hard up and borrowed from the old\ndame doesnt seem likely either that she borrowed a large sum or\nthat Giselle could have a hold over her.",
    "Seems rather too small a fish\nfor what were looking for.",
    "And I dont think a hairdressers assistant\nhas the remotest chance of laying her hands on snake venom.",
    "They\ndont use it as a hair dye or for face massage.",
    "In a way it was rather a mistake to use snake venom it narrows\nthings down a lot.",
    "Only about two people in a hundred would be likely\nto have any knowledge of it and be able to lay hands on the stuff.",
    "Which makes one thing at least perfectly clear said Poirot.",
    "It was Fournier who shot a quick glance of inquiry at him.",
    "Japp was busy with his own ideas.",
    "I look at it like this he said.",
    "The murderer has got to fall into one of\ntwo categories.",
    "Either hes a man whos knocked about the world in\nqueer places  a man who knows something of snakes and of the more\ndeadly varieties and of the habits of the native tribes who use the\nvenom to dispose of their enemies.",
    "Thats Category No.",
    "1.",
    "And the other\n\nThe scientific line.",
    "Research.",
    "This boomslang stuff is the kind of thing\nthey experiment with in highclass laboratories.",
    "I had a talk with\nWinterspoon.",
    "Apparently snake venom  cobra venom to be exact  is\nsometimes used in medicine.",
    "Its used in the treatment of epilepsy with\na fair amount of success.",
    "Theres a lot being done in the way of\nscientific investigation into snake bite.",
    "Interesting and suggestive said Fournier.",
    "Yes.",
    "But lets go on.",
    "Neither of those categories fits the Grey girl.",
    "As\nfar as shes concerned motive seems unlikely chances of getting the\npoison poor.",
    "Actual possibility of doing the blowpipe act very doubtful\nindeed  almost impossible.",
    "See here.",
    "The three men bent over the plan.",
    "Heres No.",
    "16 said Japp.",
    "And heres No.",
    "2 where Giselle was\nsitting with a lot of people and seats intervening.",
    "If the girl didnt move\nfrom her seat  and everybody says she didnt  she couldnt possibly\nhave aimed the thorn to catch Giselle on the side of the neck.",
    "I think\nwe can take it shes pretty well out of it.",
    "Now then No.",
    "12 opposite.",
    "Thats the dentist Norman Gale.",
    "Very\nmuch the same applies to him.",
    "Small fry.",
    "I suppose hed have a slightly\nbetter chance of getting hold of snake venom.",
    "It is not an injection favored by dentists murmured Poirot gently.",
    "It\nwould be a case of kill rather than cure.",
    "A dentist has enough fun with his patients as it is said Japp\ngrinning.",
    "Still I suppose he might move in circles where you could get\naccess to some funny business in drugs.",
    "He might have a scientific\nfriend.",
    "But as regards possibility hes pretty well out of it.",
    "He did leave\nhis seat but only to go to the wash room  thats in the opposite\ndirection.",
    "On his way back to his seat he couldnt be farther than the\ngangway here and to shoot off a thorn from a blowpipe so as to catch\nthe old lady in the neck hed have to have a kind of pet thorn that\nwould do tricks and make a rightangle turn.",
    "So hes pretty well out of\nit.",
    "I agree said Fournier.",
    "Let us proceed.",
    "Well cross the gangway now.",
    "No.",
    "17.",
    "That was my seat originary said Poirot.",
    "I yielded it to one of the\nladies since she desired to be near her friend.",
    "Thats the Honorable Venetia.",
    "Well what about her Shes a big bug.",
    "She might have borrowed from Giselle.",
    "Doesnt look as though she had\nany guilty secrets in her life but perhaps she pulled a horse in a point\nto point or whatever they call it.",
    "Well have to pay a little attention to\nher.",
    "The positions possible.",
    "If Giselle had got her head turned a little\nlooking out of the window the Honorable Venetia could take a sporting\nshot  or do you call it a sporting puff  diagonally across down the\ncar it would be a bit of a fluke though.",
    "I rather think shed have to\nstand up to do it.",
    "Shes the sort of woman who goes out with the guns\nin the autumn.",
    "I dont know whether shooting with a gun is any help to\nyou with a native blowpipe.",
    "I suppose its a question of eye just the\n\n\fsame.",
    "Eye and practice.",
    "And shes probably got friends  men  whove\nbeen biggame hunters in odd parts of the globe.",
    "She might have got\nhold of some queer native stuff that way.",
    "What balderdash it all\nsounds though It doesnt make sense.",
    "It does indeed seem unlikely said Fournier.",
    "Mademoiselle Kerr  I\nsaw her at the inquest today.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "One does not\nreadily connect her with murder.",
    "Seat 13 said Japp.",
    "Lady Horbury.",
    "Shes a bit of a dark horse.",
    "I\nknow something about her Ill tell you presently.",
    "I shouldnt be\nsurprised if she had a guilty secret or two.",
    "I happen to know said Fournier that the lady in question has been\nlosing very heavily at the baccarat table at Le Pinet.",
    "Thats smart of you.",
    "Yes shes the type of pigeon to be mixed up with\nGiselle.",
    "I agree absolutely.",
    "Very well then so far so good.",
    "But how did she do it She didnt\nleave her seat either you remember.",
    "Shed have had to have knelt up\nin her seat and leaned over the top  with eleven people looking at her.",
    "Oh hell lets get on.",
    "Numbers 9 and 10 said Fournier moving his finger on the plan.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot and Doctor Bryant said Japp What has M. Poirot\nto say for himself\n\n\fPoirot shook his head sadly.",
    "Mon estomac he said pathetically.",
    "Alas that the brain should be\nthe servant of the stomach.",
    "I too said Fournier with sympathy.",
    "In the air I do not feel well.",
    "He closed his eyes and shook his head expressively.",
    "Now then Doctor Bryant.",
    "What about Doctor Bryant Big bug in\nHarley Street.",
    "Not very likely to go to a Frechwoman money lender but\nyou never know.",
    "And if any funny business crops up with a doctor hes\ndone for life Heres where my scientific theory comes in.",
    "A man like\nBryant at the top of the tree is in with all the medicalresearch people.",
    "He could pinch a test tube of snake venom as easy as winking when he\nhappens to be in some swell laboratory.",
    "They check these things my friend objected Poirot.",
    "It would not be\njust like plucking a buttercup in a meadow.",
    "Even if they do check em.",
    "A clever man could substitute something\nharmless  it could be done.",
    "Simply because a man like Bryant would\nbe above suspicion.",
    "There is much in what you say agreed Fournier.",
    "The only thing is Why did he draw attention to the thing Why not say\nthe woman died from heart failure  natural death\n\n\fPoirot coughed.",
    "The other two looked at him inquiringly.",
    "I fancy he said that that was the doctors first  well shall we say\nimpression After all it looked very like natural death  possibly as the\nresult of a wasp sting.",
    "There was a wasp remember.",
    "Not likely to forget that wasp put in Japp.",
    "Youre always harping on\nit.",
    "However continued Poirot I happened to notice the fatal thorn on\nthe ground and picked it up.",
    "Once we had found that everything\npointed to murder.",
    "The thorn would be bound to be found anyway.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "There is just a chance that the murderer might have been able to pick\nit up unobserved.",
    "Bryant\n\nBryant or another.",
    "Hm rather risky.",
    "Fournier disagreed.",
    "You think so now he said because you know that it is murder.",
    "But\nwhen a lady dies suddenly of heart failure if a man is to drop his\n\n\fhandkerchief and stoop to pick it up who will notice the action or think\ntwice about it\n\nThats true agreed Japp.",
    "Well I fancy Bryant is definitely on the list\nof suspects.",
    "He could lean his head round the corner of his seat and do\nthe blowpipe act  again diagonally across the car.",
    "But why nobody\nsaw him  However I wont go into that again.",
    "Whoever did it wasnt\nseen\n\nAnd for that I fancy there must be a reason said Fournier.",
    "A\nreason that by all I have heard  he smiled  will appeal to M. Poirot.",
    "I\nmean a psychological reason.",
    "Continue my friend said Poirot.",
    "It is interesting what you say\nthere.",
    "Supposing said Fournier that when traveling in a train you were to\npass a house in flames.",
    "Everyones eyes would at once be drawn to the\nwindow.",
    "Everyone would have his attention fixed on a certain point.",
    "A\nman in such a moment might whip out a dagger and stab a man and\nnobody would see him do it.",
    "That is true said Poirot.",
    "I remember a case in which I was\nconcerned  a case of poison where that very point arose.",
    "There was\nas you call it a psychological moment.",
    "If we discover that there was\nsuch a moment during the journey of the Prometheus \n\nWe ought to find that out by questioning the stewards and the\npassengers said Japp.",
    "True.",
    "But if there was such a psychological moment it must follow\nlogically that the cause of that moment must have originated with the\nmurderer.",
    "He must have been able to produce the particular effect\nthat caused that moment.",
    "Perfectly perfectly said the Frenchman.",
    "Well well note down that as a point for questions said Japp.",
    "Im\ncoming now to Seat No.",
    "8  Daniel Michael Clancy.",
    "Japp spoke the name with a certain amount of relish.",
    "In my opinion hes the most likely suspect weve got.",
    "Whats easier\nthan for a mystery author to fake up an interest in snake venom and\nget some unsuspecting scientific chemist to let him handle the stuff\nDont forget he went down past Giselles seat  the only one of the\npassengers who did.",
    "I assure you my friend said Poirot that I have not forgotten that\npoint.",
    "He spoke with emphasis.",
    "Japp went on\n\nHe could have used that blowpipe from fairly close quarters without\nany need of a psychological moment as you call it.",
    "And he stood quite\na respectable chance of getting away with it.",
    "Remember he knows all\nabout blowpipes he said so.",
    "Which makes one pause perhaps.",
    "Sheer artfulness said Japp.",
    "And as to this blowpipe he produced\ntoday  who is to say that its the one he bought two years ago The\nwhole thing looks very fishy to me.",
    "I dont think its healthy for a man to\nbe always brooding over crime and detective stories.",
    "Reading up all\nsorts of cases.",
    "It puts ideas into his head.",
    "It is certainly necessary for a writer to have ideas in his head agreed\nPoirot.",
    "Japp returned to his plan of the plane.",
    "No.",
    "4 was Ryder  the seat slap in front of the dead woman.",
    "Dont think\nhe did it.",
    "But we cant leave him out.",
    "He went to the wash room he\ncould have taken a pot shot on the way back from fairly close quarters.",
    "The only thing is hed be right up against the archaeologist fellows\nwhen he did so.",
    "Theyd notice it  couldnt help it.",
    "Poirot shook his head thoughtfully.",
    "You are not perhaps acquainted with many archaeologists If these\ntwo were having a really absorbing discussion on some point at issue eh bien my friend their concentration would be such that they could\nbe quite blind and deaf to the outside world.",
    "They would be existing\nyou see in 5000 or so b.c.",
    "Nineteen hundred and thirtyfour a.d. would\nhave been nonexistent for them.",
    "Japp looked a little skeptical.",
    "Well well pass on to them.",
    "What can you tell us about the Duponts\nFournier\n\nM. Armand Dupont is one of the most distinguished archaeologists in\nFrance.",
    "Then that doesnt get us anywhere much.",
    "Their position in the car is\npretty good from my point of view  across the gangway but slightly\nfarther forward than Giselle.",
    "And I suppose that theyve knocked about\nthe world and dug things up in a lot of queer places they might easily\nhave got hold of some native snake poison.",
    "It is possible yes said Fournier.",
    "But you dont believe its likely\n\nFournier shook his head doubtfully.",
    "M. Dupont lives for his profession.",
    "He is an enthusiast.",
    "He was\nformerly an antique dealer.",
    "He gave up a flourishing business to\ndevote himself to excavation.",
    "Both he and his son are devoted heart\nand soul to their profession.",
    "It seems to me unlikely  I will not say\nimpossible since the ramifications of the Stavisky business I will\nbelieve anything  unlikely that they are mixed up in this business.",
    "All right said Japp.",
    "He picked up the sheet of paper on which he had been making notes\nand cleared his throat.",
    "This is where we stand Jane Grey.",
    "Probability poor.",
    "Possibility\npractically nil.",
    "Gale.",
    "Probability poor.",
    "Possibility again practically nil.",
    "Miss Kerr.",
    "Very improbable.",
    "Possibility doubtful.",
    "Lady Horbury.",
    "Probability good.",
    "Possibility practically nil.",
    "M. Poirot almost certainly\nthe criminal the only man on board who could create a psychological\nmoment.",
    "Japp enjoyed a good laugh over his little joke and Poirot smiled\nindulgently and Fournier a trifle diffidently.",
    "Then the detective\nresumed\n\nBryant.",
    "Probability and possibility both good.",
    "Clancy.",
    "Motive\ndoubtful probability and possibility very good indeed.",
    "Ryder.",
    "Probability uncertain possibility quite fair.",
    "The two Duponts.",
    "Probability poor as regards motive good as to means of obtaining\npoison.",
    "Possibility good.",
    "Thats a pretty fair summary I think as fair as we can go.",
    "Well have\nto do a lot of routine inquiry.",
    "I shall take on Clancy and Bryant first find\nout what theyve been up to if theyve been hard up at any time in the\npast if theyve seemed worried or upset lately their movement in the\nlast year  all that sort of stuff.",
    "Ill do the same for Ryder.",
    "Then it wont\ndo to neglect the others entirely.",
    "Ill get Wilson to nose round there.",
    "M.\nFournier here will undertake the Duponts.",
    "The man from the S\u044bret\u00e9 nodded.",
    "Be well assured that will be attended to.",
    "I shall return to Paris\ntonight.",
    "There may be something to be got out of \u00c9lise Giselles maid\nnow that we know a little more about the case.",
    "Also I will check up\n\n\fGiselles movements very carefully.",
    "It will be well to know where she\nhas been during the summer.",
    "She was I know at Le Pinet once or\ntwice.",
    "We may get information as to her contacts with some of the\nEnglish people involved.",
    "Ah yes there is much to do.",
    "They both looked at Poirot who was absorbed in thought.",
    "You going to take a hand at all M. Poirot asked Japp.",
    "Poirot roused himself.",
    "Yes I think I should like to accompany M. Fournier to Paris.",
    "Enchant\u00e9 said the Frenchman.",
    "What are you up to I wonder asked Japp.",
    "He looked at Poirot\ncuriously.",
    "Youve been very quiet over all this.",
    "Got some of your little\nideas eh\n\nOne or two  one or two  but it is very difficult.",
    "Lets hear about it.",
    "One thing that worries me said Poirot slowly is the place where the\nblowpipe was found.",
    "Naturally It nearly got you locked up.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "I do not mean that.",
    "It is not because it was found pushed down beside\nmy seat that it worries me  it was its being pushed down behind any\nseat.",
    "I dont see anything in that said Japp.",
    "Whoever did it had got to\nhide the thing somewhere.",
    "He couldnt risk its being found on him.",
    "\u00c9videmment.",
    "But you may have noticed my friend when you\nexamined the plane that although the windows cannot be opened\nthere is in each of them a ventilator  a circle of small round holes in\nthe glass which can be opened or closed by turning a fan of glass.",
    "These holes are of a sufficient circumference to admit the passage of\nour blowpipe.",
    "What could be simpler than to get rid of the blowpipe\nthat way It falls to the earth beneath and it is extremely unlikely that it\nwill ever be found.",
    "I can think of an objection to that  the murderer was afraid of being\nseen.",
    "If he pushed the blowpipe through the ventilator someone might\nhave noticed.",
    "I see said Poirot.",
    "He was not afraid of being seen\nplacing the blowpipe to his lips and dispatching the fatal dart but he\nwas afraid of being seen trying to push the blowpipe through the\nwindow\n\nSounds absurd I admit said Japp but there it is.",
    "He did hide the\nblowpipe behind the cushion of a seat.",
    "We cant get away from that.",
    "Poirot did not answer and Fournier asked curiously\n\nIt gives you an idea that\n\n\fPoirot bowed his head assentingly.",
    "It gives rise to say a speculation in my mind.",
    "With absentminded fingers he straightened the unused inkstand that\nJapps impatient hand had set a little askew.",
    "Then lifting his head sharply he asked\n\n\u0410 propos have you that detailed list of the belongings of the\npassengers that I asked you to get me\n\nChapter 8\n\nIm a man of my word I am said Japp.",
    "He grinned and dived his hand into his pocket bringing out a mass of\nclosely typewritten paper.",
    "Here you are.",
    "Its all here down to the minutest detail And Ill admit\nthat there is one rather curious thing in it.",
    "Ill talk to you about it when\nyouve finished reading the stuff.",

    "On the face of it he said it seems to point very plainly to one\nperson as having committed the crime.",
    "And yet I cannot see why or\neven how.",

    "Are you pulling my leg Moosior Poirot\n\nNo no.",
    "Quelle id\u00e9e\n\nThe Frenchman in his turn laid down the sheets.",
    "What about you Fournier\n\nThe Frenchman shook his head.",
    "I may be stupid he said but I cannot see that this list advances us\nmuch.",
    "Not by itself said Poirot but taken in conjunction with certain\nfeatures of the case... No Well it may be that I am wrong  quite\nwrong.",
    "Well come out with your theory said Japp.",
    "Ill be interested to hear\nit at all events.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "No as you say it is a theory  a theory only.",
    "I hoped to find a certain\nobject on that list.",
    "Eh bien I have found it.",
    "It is there.",
    "But it seems to\npoint in the wrong direction.",

    "You do not\nfind it so No I see you do not.",
    "Let us then each work to his own idea.",
    "I have no certainty I tell you only a certain suspicion.",
    "I believe youre just talking through your hat said Japp.",
    "He rose.",
    "Well lets call it a day.",
    "I work the London end you return to Paris\nFournier  and what about our M. Poirot\n\nI still wish to accompany M. Fournier to Paris  more than ever now.",
    "More than ever Id like to know just what kind of maggot youve got in\nyour brain.",
    "Maggot Ce nest pas joli \u0437a\n\nFournier shook hands ceremoniously.",
    "I wish you good evening with many thanks for your delightful\nhospitality.",
    "We will meet then at Croydon tomorrow morning\n\nExactly.",
    "\u0410 demain.",
    "Let us hope said Fournier that nobody will murder us en route.",
    "The two detectives departed.",
    "Poirot remained for a time as in a dream.",
    "Then he rose cleared away\nany traces of disorder emptied the ash trays and straightened the\nchairs.",
    "He went to a side table and picked up a copy of the Sketch.",
    "He turned\nthe pages until he came to the one he sought.",
    "Two Sun Worshippers it was headed.",
    "The Countess of Horbury and\nMr Raymond Barraclough at Le Pinet.",
    "He looked at the two laughing\nfigures in bathing suits their arms entwined.",
    "I wonder said Hercule Poirot.",
    "One might do something along those\nlines.",
    "Yes one might.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nThe weather on the following day was of so perfect a nature that even\nHercule Poirot had to admit that his estomac was perfectly peaceful.",
    "On this occasion they were traveling by the 845 air service to Paris.",
    "There were seven or eight travelers besides Poirot and Fournier in the\ncompartment and the Frenchman utilized the journey to make some\nexperiments.",
    "He took from his pocket a small piece of bamboo and\n\n\fthree times during the journey he raised this to his lips pointing it in a\ncertain direction.",
    "Once he did it bending himself round the corner of\nhis seat.",
    "Once with his head slightly turned sideways.",
    "Once when he\nwas returning from the wash room.",
    "And on each occasion he caught\nthe eye of some passenger or other eying him with mild astonishment.",
    "On the last occasion indeed every eye in the car seemed to be fixed\nupon him.",
    "Fournier sank in his seat discouraged and was but little cheered by\nobserving Poirots open amusement.",
    "You are amused my friend But you agree one must try the\nexperiments\n\n\u00c9videmment In truth I admire your thoroughness.",
    "There is nothing\nlike ocular demonstration.",
    "You play the part of the murderer with\nblowpipe.",
    "The result is perfectly clear.",
    "Everybody sees you\n\nNot everybody.",
    "In a sense no.",
    "On each occasion there is somebody who does not see\nyou.",
    "But for a successful murder that is not enough.",
    "You must be\nreasonably sure that nobody will see you.",
    "And that is impossible given ordinary conditions said Fournier.",
    "I\nhold then to my theory that there must have been extraordinary\nconditions.",
    "The psychological moment There must have been a\npsychological moment when everyones attention was mathematically\ncentered elsewhere.",
    "Our friend Inspector Japp is going to make minute inquiries on that\npoint.",
    "Do you not agree with me M. Poirot\n\nPoirot hesitated a minute then he said slowly\n\nI agree that there was  that there must have been a psychological\nreason why nobody saw the murderer.",
    "But ideas are running in a\nslightly different channel from yours.",
    "I feel that in this case mere\nocular facts may be deceptive.",
    "Close your eyes my friend instead of\nopening them wide.",
    "Use the eyes of the brain not of the body.",
    "Let the\nlittle grey cells of the mind function.",
    "Let it be their task to show you\nwhat actually happened.",
    "Fournier stared at him curiously.",
    "I do not follow you M. Poirot.",
    "Because you are deducing from things that you have seen.",
    "Nothing\ncan be so misleading as observation.",
    "Fournier shook his head again and spread out his hands.",
    "I give it up.",
    "I cannot catch your meanings.",
    "Our friend Giraud would urge you to pay no attention to my vagaries.",
    "Be up and doing he would say.",
    "To sit still in an armchair and think that is the method of an old man past his prime.",
    "But I say that a young\nhound is often so eager upon the scent that he overruns it.",
    "For him is\n\n\fthe trail of the red herring.",
    "There it is a very good hint I have given you\nthere.",
    "And leaning back Poirot closed his eyes it may have been to think but\nit is quite certain that five minutes later he was fast asleep.",
    "On arrival in Paris they went straight to No.",
    "3 Rue Joliette.",
    "The Rue Joliette is on the south side of the Seine.",
    "There was nothing to\ndistinguish No.",
    "3 from the other houses.",
    "An aged concierge admitted\nthem and greeted Fournier in a surly fashion.",
    "So we have the police here again Nothing but trouble.",
    "This will give\nthe house a bad name.",
    "He retreated grumbling into his apartment.",
    "We will go to Giselles office said Fournier.",
    "It is on the first floor.",
    "He drew a key from his pocket as he spoke and explained that the\nFrench police had taken the precaution of locking and sealing the door\nwhilst awaiting the result of the English inquest.",
    "Not I fear said Fournier that there is anything here to help us.",
    "He detached the seals unlocked the door and they entered.",
    "Madame\nGiselles office was a small stuffy apartment.",
    "It had a somewhat oldfashioned type of safe in a corner a writing desk of businesslike\n\n\fappearance and several shabbily upholstered chairs.",
    "The one window\nwas dirty and it seemed highly probable that it had never been\nopened.",
    "Fournier shrugged his shoulders as he looked round.",
    "You see he said.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "Poirot passed round behind the desk.",
    "He sat down in the chair and\nlooked across the desk at Fournier.",
    "He passed his hand gently across\nthe surface of the wood then down underneath it.",
    "There is a bell here he said.",
    "Yes it rings down to the concierge.",
    "Ah a wise precaution.",
    "Madames clients might sometimes become\nobstreperous.",
    "He opened one or two of the drawers.",
    "They contained stationery a\ncalendar pens and pencils but no papers and nothing of a personal\nnature.",
    "Poirot merely glanced into them in a cursory manner.",
    "I will not insult you my friend by a close search.",
    "If there were\nanything to find you would have found it I am sure.",
    "He looked across\nat the safe.",
    "Not a very efficacious pattern that.",
    "Somewhat out of date agreed Fournier.",
    "It was empty\n\nYes.",
    "That cursed maid had destroyed everything.",
    "Ah yes the maid.",
    "The confidential maid.",
    "We must see her.",
    "This room\nas you say has nothing to tell us.",
    "It is significant that do you not think\nso\n\nWhat do you mean by significant M. Poirot\n\nI mean that there is in this room no personal touch.",
    "I find that\ninteresting.",
    "She was hardly a woman of sentiment said Fournier dryly.",
    "Poirot rose.",
    "Come he said.",
    "Let us see this maid  this highly confidential maid.",
    "\u00c9lise Grandier was a short stout woman of middle age with a florid\nface and small shrewd eyes that darted quickly from Fourniers face to\nthat of his companion and then back again.",
    "Sit down Mademoiselle Grandier said Fournier.",
    "Thank you monsieur.",
    "She sat down composedly.",
    "M. Poirot and I have returned today from London.",
    "The inquest  the\ninquiry that is into the death of madame  took place yesterday.",
    "There\nis no doubt whatsoever.",
    "Madame was poisoned.",
    "The Frenchwoman shook her head gravely.",
    "It is terrible what you say there monsieur.",
    "Madame poisoned.",
    "Who\nwould ever have dreamed of such a thing\n\nThat is perhaps where you can help us mademoiselle.",
    "Certainly monsieur I will naturally do all I can to aid the police.",
    "But I\nknow nothing  nothing at all.",
    "You know that madame had enemies said Fournier sharply.",
    "That is not true.",
    "Why should madame have enemies\n\nCome come Mademoiselle Grandier said Fournier dryly.",
    "The\nprofession of a money lender  it entails certain unpleasantnesses.",
    "It is true that sometimes the clients of madame were not very\nreasonable agreed \u00c9lise.",
    "They made scenes eh They threatened her\n\nThe maid shook her head.",
    "No no you are wrong there.",
    "It was not they who threatened.",
    "They\nwhined they complained they protested they could not pay  all that\nyes.",
    "Her voice held a very lively contempt.",
    "Sometimes perhaps mademoiselle said Poirot they could not\npay.",
    "\u00c9lise Grandier shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Possibly.",
    "That is their affair They usually paid in the end.",
    "Her tone held a certain amount of satisfaction.",
    "Madame Giselle was a hard woman said Fournier.",
    "Madame was justified.",
    "You have no pity for the victims\n\nVictims  victims.",
    "\u00c9lise spoke with impatience.",
    "You do not\nunderstand.",
    "Is it necessary to run into debt To live beyond your\nmeans To run and borrow and then expect to keep the money as a\ngift It is not reasonable that Madame was always fair and just.",
    "She\nlent and she expected repayment.",
    "That is only fair.",
    "She herself had no\ndebts.",
    "Always she paid honorably what she owed.",
    "Never never were\nthere any bills outstanding.",
    "And when you say that madame was a hard\nwoman it is not the truth Madame was kind.",
    "She gave to the Little\nSisters of the Poor when they came.",
    "She gave money to charitable\ninstitutions.",
    "When the wife of Georges the concierge was ill madame\npaid for her to go to a hospital in the country.",
    "She stopped her face flushed and angry.",
    "She repeated You do not understand.",
    "No you do not understand\nmadame at all.",
    "Fournier waited a moment for her indignation to subside and then\nsaid\n\nYou made the observation that madames clients usually managed to\npay in the end.",
    "Were you aware of the means madame used to compel\nthem\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.",
    "I know nothing monsieur  nothing at all.",
    "You knew enough to burn madames papers.",
    "I was following her instructions.",
    "If ever she said she were to meet\nwith an accident or if she were taken ill and died somewhere away\nfrom home I was to destroy her business papers.",
    "The papers in the safe downstairs asked Poirot.",
    "That is right.",
    "Her business papers.",
    "And they were in the safe downstairs\n\nHis persistence brought the red up in \u00c9lises cheeks.",
    "I obeyed madames instructions she said.",
    "I know that said Poirot smiling.",
    "But the papers were not in the\nsafe.",
    "That is so is it not That safe it is far too oldfashioned quite an\namateur might have opened it.",
    "The papers were kept elsewhere.",
    "In\nmadames bedroom perhaps\n\n\u00c9lise paused a moment and then answered\n\nYes that is so.",
    "Madame always pretended to clients that papers were\nkept in the safe but in reality the safe was a blind.",
    "Everything was in\nmadames bedroom.",
    "Will you show us where\n\n\u00c9lise rose and the two men followed her.",
    "The bedroom was a fairsized\nroom but was so full of ornate heavy furniture that it was hard to move\nabout freely in it.",
    "In one corner was a large oldfashioned trunk.",
    "\u00c9lise\nlifted the lid and took out an oldfashioned alpaca dress with a silk\nunderskirt.",
    "On the inside of the dress was a deep pocket.",
    "The papers were in this monsieur she said.",
    "They were kept in a\nlarge sealed envelope.",
    "You told me nothing of this said Fournier sharply when I\nquestioned you three days ago\n\n\fI ask pardon monsieur.",
    "You asked me where were the papers that\nshould be in the safe I told you I had burned them.",
    "That was true.",
    "Exactly where the papers were kept seemed unimportant.",
    "True said Fournier.",
    "You understand Mademoiselle Grandier that\nthose papers should not have been burned.",
    "I obeyed madames orders said \u00c9lise sullenly.",
    "You acted I know for the best said Fournier soothingly.",
    "Now I\nwant you to listen to me very closely mademoiselle.",
    "Madame was\nmurdered.",
    "It is possible that she was murdered by a person or persons\nabout whom she held certain damaging knowledge.",
    "That knowledge\nwas in those papers you burned.",
    "I am going to ask you a question\nmademoiselle and do not reply too quickly without reflection.",
    "It is\npossible  indeed in my view it is probable and quite understandable that you glanced through those papers before committing them to the\nflames.",
    "If that is the case no blame will be attached to you for so\ndoing.",
    "On the contrary any information you have acquired may be of\nthe greatest service to the police and may be of material service in\nbringing the murderer to justice.",
    "Therefore mademoiselle have no\nfear in answering truthfully.",
    "Did you before burning the papers\nglance over them\n\n\u00c9lise breathed hard.",
    "She leaned forward and spoke emphatically.",
    "No monsieur she said I looked at nothing.",
    "I read nothing.",
    "I burned\nthe envelope without undoing the seal.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nFournier stared hard at her for a moment or two.",
    "Then satisfied that\nshe was speaking the truth he turned away with a gesture of\ndiscouragement.",
    "It is a pity he said.",
    "You acted honorably mademoiselle but it is a\npity.",
    "I cannot help it monsieur.",
    "I am sorry.",
    "Fournier sat down and drew a notebook from his pocket.",
    "When I questioned you before you told me mademoiselle that you\ndid not know the names of madames clients.",
    "Yet just now you speak\nof them whining and asking for mercy.",
    "You did therefore know\nsomething about these clients of Madame Giselles\n\nLet me explain monsieur.",
    "Madame never mentioned a name.",
    "She\nnever discussed her business.",
    "But all the same one is human is one\nnot There are ejaculations comments.",
    "Madame spoke to me\nsometimes as she would to herself.",
    "Poirot leaned forward.",
    "If you would give us an instance mademoiselle  he said.",
    "Let me see  ah yes  say a letter comes.",
    "Madame opens it.",
    "She\nlaughs  a short dry laugh.",
    "She says You whine and you snivel my fine\nlady.",
    "All the same you must pay.",
    "Or she would say to me What fools\nWhat fools To think I would lend large sums without proper security.",
    "Knowledge is security \u00c9lise.",
    "Knowledge is power.",
    "Something like that\nshe would say.",
    "Madames clients who came to the house  did you ever see any of\nthem\n\nNo monsieur  at least hardly ever.",
    "They came to the first floor only\nyou understand.",
    "And very often they came after dark.",
    "Had Madame Giselle been in Paris before her journey to England\n\nShe returned to Paris only the afternoon before.",
    "Where had she been\n\nShe had been away for a fortnight  to Deauville Le Pinet Paris Plage and Wimereaux  her usual September round.",
    "Now think mademoiselle.",
    "Did she say anything  anything at all  that\nmight be of use\n\n\u00c9lise considered for some moments.",
    "Then she shook her head.",
    "No monsieur she said I cannot remember anything.",
    "Madame was\nin good spirits.",
    "Business was going well she said.",
    "Her tour had been\nprofitable.",
    "Then she directed me to ring up Universal Air Lines and\n\n\fbook a passage to England for the following day.",
    "The earlymorning\nservice was booked but she obtained a seat on the twelveoclock\nservice.",
    "Did she say what took her to England Was there any urgency about\nit\n\nOh no monsieur.",
    "Madame journeyed to England fairly frequently.",
    "She usually told me the day before.",
    "Did any clients come to see madame that evening\n\nI believe there was one client monsieur but I am not sure.",
    "Georges\nperhaps would know.",
    "Madame said nothing to me.",
    "Fournier took from his pockets various photographs  mostly\nsnapshots taken by reporters of various witnesses leaving the\ncoroners court.",
    "Can you recognize any of these mademoiselle\n\n\u00c9lise took them and gazed at each in turn.",
    "Then she shook her head.",
    "No monsieur.",
    "We must try Georges then.",
    "Yes monsieur.",
    "Unfortunately Georges has not very good eyesight.",
    "It\nis a pity.",
    "Fournier rose.",
    "Well mademoiselle we will take our leave.",
    "That is if you are quite\nsure that there is nothing  nothing at all  that you have omitted to\nmention\n\nI What  what could there be\n\n\u00c9lise looked distressed.",
    "It is understood then... Come M. Poirot...",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "You are\nlooking for something\n\nPoirot was indeed wandering round the room in a vague searching\nway.",
    "It is true said Poirot.",
    "I am looking for something I do not see.",
    "What is that\n\nPhotographs.",
    "Photographs of Madame Giselles relations  of her\nfamily.",
    "\u00c9lise shook her head.",
    "She had no family madame.",
    "She was alone in the world.",
    "She had a daughter said Poirot sharply.",
    "Yes that is so.",
    "Yes she had a daughter.",
    "\u00c9lise sighed.",
    "But there is no picture of that daughter Poirot persisted.",
    "Oh monsieur does not understand.",
    "It is true that madame had a\ndaughter but that was long ago you comprehend.",
    "It is my belief that\nmadame had never seen that daughter since she was a tiny baby.",
    "How was that demanded Fournier sharply.",
    "\u00c9lises hands flew out in an expressive gesture.",
    "I do not know.",
    "It was in the days when madame was young.",
    "I have\nheard that she was pretty then.",
    "Pretty and poor.",
    "She may have been\nmarried.",
    "She may not.",
    "Myself I think not.",
    "Doubtless some arrangement\nwas made about the child.",
    "As for madame she had the smallpox she\nwas very ill she nearly died.",
    "When she got well her beauty was gone.",
    "There were no more follies no more romance.",
    "Madame became a\nwoman of business.",
    "But she left her money to this daughter\n\nThat is only right said \u00c9lise.",
    "Who should one leave ones money to\nexcept ones own flesh and blood Blood is thicker than water.",
    "And\nmadame had no friends.",
    "She was always alone.",
    "Money was her\npassion.",
    "To make more and more money.",
    "She spent very little.",
    "She had\nno love for luxury.",
    "She left you a legacy.",
    "You know that\n\n\fBut yes I have been informed.",
    "Madame was always generous.",
    "She\ngave me a good sum every year as well as my wages.",
    "I am very\ngrateful to madame.",
    "Well said Fournier we will take our leave.",
    "On the way out I will have\nanother word with old Georges.",
    "Permit me to follow you in a little minute my friend said Poirot.",
    "As you wish.",
    "Fournier departed.",
    "Poirot roamed once more round the room then sat down and fixed his\neyes on \u00c9lise.",
    "Under his scrutiny the Frenchwoman got slightly restive.",
    "Is there anything more monsieur requires to know\n\nMademoiselle Grandier said Poirot do you know who murdered\nyour mistress\n\nNo monsieur.",
    "Before the good God I swear it.",
    "She spoke very earnestly Poirot looked at her searchingly then bent\nhis head.",
    "Bien he said.",
    "I accept that.",
    "But knowledge is one thing suspicion is\nanother.",
    "Have you any idea  an idea only  who might have done such\na thing\n\nI have no idea monsieur.",
    "I have already said so to the agent of\npolice.",
    "You might say one thing to him and another thing to me.",
    "Why do you say that monsieur Why should I do such a thing\n\nBecause it is one thing to give information to the police and another\nthing to give it to a private individual.",
    "Yes admitted \u00c9lise that is true.",
    "A look of indecision came over her face.",
    "She seemed to be thinking.",
    "Watching her very closely Poirot leaned forward and spoke\n\nShall I tell you something.",
    "Mademoiselle Grandier It is part of my\nbusiness to believe nothing I am told  nothing that is that is not\nproved.",
    "I do not suspect first this person and then that person I\nsuspect everybody.",
    "Anybody connected with a crime is regarded by\nme as a criminal until that person is proved innocent.",
    "Elsie Grandier scowled at him angrily.",
    "Are you saying that you suspect me  me  of having murdered\nmadame It is too strong that Such a thought is of a wickedness\nunbelievable\n\n\fHer large bosom rose and fell tumultuously.",
    "No \u00c9lise said Poirot I do not suspect you of having murdered\nmadame.",
    "Whoever murdered madame was a passenger in the\naeroplane.",
    "Therefore it was not your hand that did the deed.",
    "But you\nmight have been an accomplice before the act.",
    "You might have passed\non to someone the details of madames journey.",
    "I did not.",
    "I swear I did not.",
    "Poirot looked at her again for some minutes in silence.",
    "Then he\nnodded his head.",
    "I believe you he said.",
    "But nevertheless there is something that\nyou conceal... Oh yes there is Listen I will tell you something.",
    "In\nevery case of a criminal nature one comes across the same\nphenomena when questioning witnesses.",
    "Everyone keeps something\nback.",
    "Sometimes  often indeed  it is something quite harmless\nsomething perhaps quite unconnected with the crime but  I say it\nagain  there is always something.",
    "That is so with you.",
    "Oh do not deny\nI am Hercule Poirot and I know.",
    "When my friend M. Fournier asked you\nif you were sure there was nothing you had omitted to mention you\nwere troubled.",
    "You answered unconsciously with an evasion.",
    "Again\njust now when I suggested that you might tell me something which you\nwould not care to tell the police you very obviously turned the\nsuggestion over in your mind.",
    "There is then something.",
    "I want to\nknow what that something is.",
    "It is nothing of importance.",
    "Possibly not.",
    "But all the same will you not tell me what it is\nRemember he went on as she hesitated I am not of the police.",
    "That is true said \u00c9lise Grandier.",
    "She hesitated and went on\nMonsieur I am in a difficulty.",
    "I do not know what madame herself\nwould have wanted me to do.",
    "There is a saying that two heads are better than one.",
    "Will you not\nconsult me Let us examine the question together.",
    "The woman still looked at him doubtfully.",
    "He said with a smile\n\nYou are a good watch dog \u00c9lise.",
    "It is a question I see of loyalty to\nyour dead mistress\n\nThat is quite right monsieur.",
    "Madame trusted me.",
    "Ever since I\nentered her service I have carried out her instructions faithfully.",
    "You were grateful were you not for some great service she had\nrendered you\n\nMonsieur is very quick.",
    "Yes that is true.",
    "I do not mind admitting it.",
    "I\nhad been deceived monsieur my savings stolen and there was a\nchild.",
    "Madame was good to me.",
    "She arranged for the baby to be\nbrought up by some good people on a farm  a good farm monsieur\nand honest people.",
    "It was then at that time that she mentioned to me\nthat she too was a mother.",
    "Did she tell you the age of her child where it was any details\n\n\fNo monsieur she spoke as of a part of her life that was over and\ndone with.",
    "It was best so she said.",
    "The little girl was well provided for\nand would be brought up to a trade or profession.",
    "It would also inherit\nher money when she died.",
    "She told you nothing further about this child or about its father\n\nNo monsieur but I have an idea \n\nSpeak Mademoiselle \u00c9lise.",
    "It is an idea only you understand.",
    "Perfectly perfectly.",
    "I have an idea that the father of the child was an Englishman.",
    "What exactly do you think gave you that impression\n\nNothing definite.",
    "It is just that there was a bitterness in madames\nvoice when she spoke of the English.",
    "I think too that in her business\ntransactions she enjoyed having anyone English in her power.",
    "It is an\nimpression only.",
    "Yes but it may be a very valuable one.",
    "It opens up possibilities...",
    "Your\nown child.",
    "Mademoiselle \u00c9lise Was it a girl or a boy\n\nA girl monsieur.",
    "But she is dead  dead these five years now.",
    "Ah all my sympathy.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "And now Mademoiselle \u00c9lise said Poirot what is this something\nthat you have hitherto refrained from mentioning\n\n\u00c9lise rose and left the room.",
    "She returned a few minutes later with a\nsmall shabby black notebook in her hand.",
    "This little book was madames.",
    "It went with her everywhere.",
    "When she\nwas about to depart for England she could not find it.",
    "It was mislaid.",
    "After she had gone I found it.",
    "It had dropped down behind the head of\nthe bed.",
    "I put it in my room to keep until madame should return.",
    "I\nburned the papers as soon as I heard of madames death but I did not\nburn the book.",
    "There were no instructions as to that.",
    "When did you hear of madames death\n\n\u00c9lise hesitated a minute.",
    "You heard it from the police did you not said Poirot.",
    "They came\nhere and examined madames papers.",
    "They found the safe empty and\nyou told them that you had burned the papers but actually you did not\nburn the papers until afterwards.",
    "It is true monsieur admitted \u00c9lise.",
    "Whilst they were looking in the\nsafe I removed the papers from the trunk.",
    "I said they were burned\nyes.",
    "After all it was very nearly the truth.",
    "I burned them at the first\nopportunity.",
    "I had to carry out madames orders.",
    "You see my difficulty\n\n\fmonsieur You will not inform the police It might be a very serious\nmatter for me.",
    "I believe Mademoiselle \u00c9lise that you acted with the best intentions.",
    "All the same you understand it is a pity  a great pity.",
    "But it does no\ngood to regret what is done and I see no necessity for communicating\nthe exact hour of the destruction to the excellent M. Fournier.",
    "Now let\nme see if there is anything in this little book to aid us.",
    "I do not think there will be monsieur said \u00c9lise shaking her head.",
    "It is madames private memorandums yes but there are numbers\nonly.",
    "Without the documents and files these entries are meaningless.",
    "Unwillingly she held out the book to Poirot.",
    "He took it and turned the\npages.",
    "There were penciled entries in a sloping foreign writing.",
    "They\nseemed to be all of the same kind.",
    "A number followed by a few descriptive details such as\n\nCX 265.",
    "Colonels wife.",
    "Stationed Syria.",
    "Regimental funds.",
    "GF 342.",
    "French Deputy Stavisky connection.",
    "There were perhaps twenty entries in all.",
    "At the end of the book were\npenciled memoranda of dates or places such as\n\n\fLe Pinet Monday.",
    "Casino 1030.",
    "Savoy Hotel 5 oclock.",
    "A.B.C.",
    "Fleet\nStreet 11 oclock.",
    "None of these were complete in themselves and seemed to have been\nput down less as actual appointments than as aids to Giselles\nmemory.",
    "\u00c9lise was watching Poirot anxiously.",
    "It means nothing monsieur or so it seems to me.",
    "It was\ncomprehensible to madame but not to a mere reader.",
    "Poirot closed the book and put it in his pocket.",
    "This may be very valuable mademoiselle.",
    "You did wisely to give it to\nme.",
    "And your conscience may be quite at rest.",
    "Madame never asked\nyou to burn this book.",
    "That is true said \u00c9lise her face brightening a little.",
    "Therefore having no instructions it is your duty to hand this over to\nthe police.",
    "I will arrange matters with M. Fournier so that you shall not\nbe blamed for not having done so sooner.",
    "Monsieur is very kind.",
    "Poirot rose.",
    "I will go now and join my colleague.",
    "Just one last question When you\nreserved a seat in the aeroplane for Madame Giselle did you ring up\nthe aerodrome at Le Bourget or the office of the company\n\nI rang up the office of Universal Air Lines monsieur.",
    "And that I think is in the Boulevard des Capucines\n\nThat is right monsieur Boulevard des Capucines.",
    "Poirot made a note in his little book then with a friendly nod he left\nthe room.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nFournier was deep in conversation with old Georges.",
    "The detective\nwas looking hot and annoyed.",
    "Just like the police the old man was grumbling in his deep hoarse\nvoice.",
    "Ask one the same question over and over again What do they\nhope for That sooner or later one will give over speaking the truth and\ntake to lies instead Agreeable lies naturally lies that suit the book of\nces messieurs.",
    "It is not lies I want but the truth.",
    "Very well it is the truth that I have been telling you.",
    "Yes a woman did\ncome to see madame the night before she left for England.",
    "You show\nme those photographs you ask me if I recognize the woman among\nthem.",
    "I tell you what I have told you all along  my eyesight is not good\nit was growing dark I did not look closely.",
    "I did not recognize the lady.",
    "If I saw her face to face I should probably not recognize her.",
    "There\nYou have it plainly for the fourth or fifth time.",
    "And you cannot even remember if she was tall or short dark or fair\nyoung or old It is hardly to be believed that.",
    "Fournier spoke with irritable sarcasm.",
    "Then do not believe it.",
    "What do I care A nice thing  to be mixed up\nwith the police I am ashamed.",
    "If madame had not been killed high up\nin the air you would probably pretend that I Georges had poisoned\nher.",
    "The police are like that.",
    "Poirot forestalled an angry retort on Fourniers part by slipping a\ntactful arm through that of his friend.",
    "Come mon vieux he said.",
    "The stomach calls.",
    "A simple but\nsatisfying meal that is what I prescribe.",
    "Let us say omelette aux\nchampignons Sole \u0430 la Normande a cheese of Port Salut.",
    "And with it\nred wine.",
    "What wine exactly\n\nFournier glanced at his watch.",
    "True he said.",
    "It is one oclock.",
    "Talking to this animal here  He\nglared at Georges.",
    "Poirot smiled encouragingly at the old man.",
    "It is understood he said.",
    "The nameless lady was neither tall nor\nshort fair nor dark thin nor fat but this at least you can tell us Was\nshe chic\n\nChic said Georges rather taken aback.",
    "I am answered said Poirot.",
    "She was chic.",
    "And I have a little idea\nmy friend that she would look well in a bathing dress.",
    "George stared at him.",
    "A bathing dress What is this about a bathing dress\n\nA little idea of mine.",
    "A charming woman looks still more charming in a\nbathing dress.",
    "Do you not agree See here\n\nHe passed to the old man a page torn from the Sketch.",
    "There was a moments pause.",
    "The old man gave a very slight start.",
    "You agree do you not asked Poirot.",
    "They look well enough those two said the old man handing the\nsheet back.",
    "To wear nothing at all would be very nearly the same\nthing.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "That is because nowadays we have discovered the\nbeneficial action of sun on the skin.",
    "It is very convenient that.",
    "Georges condescended to give a hoarse chuckle and moved away as\nPoirot and Fournier stepped out into the sunlit street.",
    "Over the meal as outlined by Poirot the little Belgian produced the\nlittle black memorandum book.",
    "Fournier was much excited though distinctly irate with \u00c9lise.",
    "Poirot\nargued the point\n\nIt is natural  very natural.",
    "The police  it is always a word frightening\nto that class.",
    "It embroils them in they know not what.",
    "It is the same\neverywhere in every country.",
    "That is where you score said Fournier.",
    "The private investigator\ngets more out of witnesses than you ever get through official channels.",
    "However there is the other side of the picture.",
    "We have official\nrecords the whole system of a big organization at our command.",
    "So let us work together amicably said Poirot smiling...",
    "This omelet\nis delicious.",
    "In the interval between the omelet and the sole Fournier turned the\npages of the black book.",
    "Then he made a penciled entry in his\nnotebook.",
    "He looked across at Poirot.",
    "You have read through this Yes\n\nNo I have only glanced at it.",
    "You permit\n\nHe took the book from Fournier.",
    "When the cheese was placed before them Poirot laid down the book\non the table and the eyes of the two men met.",
    "There are certain entries began Fournier.",
    "Five said Poirot.",
    "I agree.",
    "Five.",
    "He read out from the notebook\n\nCL 52.",
    "English Peeress.",
    "Husband.",
    "RT 362.",
    "Doctor.",
    "Harley Street.",
    "MR 24.",
    "Forged Antiquities.",
    "XVB 724.",
    "English.",
    "Embezzlement.",
    "GF 45.",
    "Attempted Murder.",
    "English.",
    "Excellent my friend said Poirot.",
    "Our minds march together to a\nmarvel.",
    "Of all the entries in that little book those five seem to me to be\n\n\fthe only ones that can in any way bear a relation to the persons\ntraveling in the aeroplane.",
    "Let us take them one by one.",
    "English Peeress.",
    "Husband said Fournier.",
    "That may conceivably\napply to Lady Horbury.",
    "She is I understand a confirmed gambler.",
    "Nothing could be more likely than that she should borrow money from\nGiselle.",
    "Giselles clients are usually of that type.",
    "The word husband\nmay have one of two meanings.",
    "Either Giselle expected the husband to\npay up his wifes debts or she had some hold over Lady Horbury a\nsecret which she threatened to reveal to the ladys husband.",
    "Precisely said Poirot.",
    "Either of those two alternatives might apply.",
    "I\nfavor the second one myself especially as I would be prepared to bet\nthat the woman who visited Giselle the night before the aeroplane\njourney was Lady Horbury.",
    "Ah you think that do you\n\nYes and I fancy you think the same.",
    "There is a touch of chivalry I\nthink in our concierges disposition.",
    "His persistence in remembering\nnothing at all about the visitor seems rather significant.",
    "Lady Horbury\nis an extremely pretty woman.",
    "Moreover I observed his start  oh a\nvery slight one  when I handed him a reproduction of her in bathing\ncostume from the Sketch.",
    "Yes it was Lady Horbury who went to\nGiselles that night.",
    "She followed her to Paris from Le Pinet said Fournier slowly.",
    "It\nlooks as though she were pretty desperate.",
    "Yes yes I fancy that may be true.",
    "Fournier looked at him curiously.",
    "But it does not square with your private ideas eh\n\nMy friend as I tell you I have what I am convinced is the right clue\npointing to the wrong person.",
    "i am very much in the dark.",

    "MR 24.",
    "Forged Antiquities read Fournier.",
    "Farfetched perhaps but\nit is just possible that that might apply to the Duponts.",
    "I can hardly\ncredit it.",
    "M. Dupont is an archaeologist of worldwide reputation.",
    "He\nbears the highest character.",
    "Which would facilitate matters very much for him said Poirot.",
    "Consider my dear Fournier how high has been the character how\n\n\flofty the sentiments and how worthy of admiration the life of most\nswindlers of note  before they are found out\n\nTrue  only too true agreed the Frenchman with a sigh.",
    "A high reputation said Poirot is the first necessity of a swindlers\nstock in trade.",

    "Good.",
    "I will accompany you.",
    "Afterwards I have a little investigation of\nmy own to make in which perhaps you will assist me.",
    "At the S\u044bret\u00e9 Poirot renewed acquaintance with the chief of the\ndetective force whom he had met some years previously in the course\nof one of his cases.",
    "M. Gilles was very affable and polite.",
    "Enchanted to learn that you are interesting yourself in this case M.\nPoirot.",
    "My faith my dear M. Gilles it happened under my nose.",
    "It is an insult\nthat you agree Hercule Poirot to sleep while murder is committed\n\nM. Gilles shook his head tactfully.",

    "He is most zealous.",
    "His energy is untiring.",
    "It always was said Poirot.",
    "He ran to and fro.",
    "He crawled on all\nfours.",

    "Ah M. Poirot that is your little foible.",

    "Exactly You hit the nail upon the head.",
    "You\nplace a finger unerringly  Ah here is our good Fournier.",
    "You have\nnews I see.",
    "The melancholyfaced Fournier was looking quite eager and excited.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "A Greek antique dealer Zeropoulos has reported the\nsale of a blowpipe and darts three days before the murder.",
    "I propose\nnow monsieur  he bowed respectfully to his chief  to interview this\nman.",
    "By all means said Gilles.",
    "Does M. Poirot accompany you\n\n\fIf you please said Poirot.",
    "This is interesting.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "The shop of M. Zeropoulos was in the Rue St. Honor\u00e9.",
    "It was by way of\nbeing a highclass antique dealers shop.",
    "There was a good deal of\nRhages ware and other Persian pottery.",
    "There were one or two\nbronzes from Luristan a good deal of inferior Indian jewelry shelves\nof silks and embroideries from many countries and a large proportion\nof perfectly worthless beads and cheap Egyptian goods.",
    "It was the\nkind of establishment in which you could spend a million francs on an\nobject worth half a million or ten francs on an object worth fifty\ncentimes.",
    "It was patronized chiefly by tourists and knowledgeable\nconnoisseurs.",
    "M. Zeropoulos himself was a short stout little man with beady black\neyes.",
    "He talked volubly and at great length.",
    "The gentlemen were from the police He was delighted to see them.",
    "Perhaps they would step into his private office.",
    "Yes he had sold a blowpipe and darts  a South American curio.",
    "You\ncomprehend gentlemen me I sell a little of everything I have my\nspecialties.",
    "Persia is my specialty.",

    "I\nhave my collection  my valuable collection that all connoisseurs know\n and also I have  Well frankly messieurs let us call it junk Foreign\njunk that is understood a little bit of everything  from the South Seas\nfrom India from Japan from Borneo.",
    "No matter Usually I have no\n\n\ffixed price for these things.",
    "If anyone takes an interest I make my\nestimate and I ask a price and naturally I am beaten down and in the\nend I take only half.",
    "And even then  I will admit it  the profit is good\nThese articles I buy them from sailors usually at a very low price.",
    "M. Zeropoulos took a breath and went on happily delighted with\nhimself his importance and the easy flow of his narration.",
    "This blowpipe and darts I have had it for a long time  two years\nperhaps.",
    "It was in that tray there with a cowrie necklace and a red\nIndian headdress and one or two crude wooden idols and some\ninferior jade beads.",
    "Nobody remarks it nobody notices it till there\ncomes this American and asks me what it is.",
    "An American said Fournier sharply.",
    "Yes yes an American  unmistakably an American  not the best type\nof American either.",
    "The kind that knows nothing about anything and\njust wants a curio to take home.",
    "He is of the type that makes the\nfortune of bead sellers in Egypt  that buys the most preposterous\nscarabs ever made in Czechoslovakia.",
    "Well very quickly I size him up.",
    "I tell him about the habits of certain tribes the deadly poisons they\nuse.",
    "I explain how very rare and unusual it is that anything of this kind\ncomes into the market.",
    "He asks the price and I tell him.",
    "It is my\nAmerican price not quite so high as formerly... Alas They have had\nthe depression over there...",
    "I wait for him to bargain but straightaway\nhe pays my price.",
    "I am stupefied.",
    "It is a pity.",
    "I might have asked more I\ngive him the blowpipe and the darts wrapped up in a parcel and he\ntakes them away.",
    "It is finished.",
    "But afterwards when I read in the\n\n\fpaper of this astounding murder I wonder  yes I wonder very much.",
    "And I communicate with the police.",
    "We are much obliged to you M. Zeropoulos said Fournier politely.",
    "This blowpipe and dart  you think you would be able to identify them\nAt the moment they are in London you understand but an opportunity\nwill be given you of identifying them.",
    "The blowpipe was about so long  M. Zeropoulos measured a space\non his desk.",
    "And so thick  you see like this pen of mine.",
    "It was of a\nlight color.",
    "There were four darts.",
    "They were long pointed thorns\nslightly discolored at the tips with a little fluff of red silk on them.",
    "Red silk asked Poirot keenly.",
    "Yes monsieur.",
    "A cerise red somewhat faded.",
    "That is curious said Fournier.",
    "You are sure that there was not one\nof them with a blackandyellow fluff of silk\n\nBlack and yellow No monsieur.",
    "The dealer shook his head.",
    "Fournier glanced at Poirot.",
    "There was a curious satisfied smile on the\nlittle mans face.",
    "Fournier wondered why.",
    "Was it because Zeropoulos was lying Or was\nit for some other reason\n\n\fFournier said doubtfully It is very possible that this blowpipe and dart\nhave nothing whatever to do with the case.",
    "It is just one chance in fifty\nperhaps.",
    "Nevertheless I should like as full a description as possible of\nthis American.",
    "Zeropoulos spread out a pair of Oriental hands.",
    "He was just an American.",
    "His voice was in his nose.",
    "He could not\nspeak French.",
    "He was chewing the gum.",
    "He had tortoiseshell glasses.",
    "He was tall and I think not very old.",
    "Fair or dark\n\nI could hardly say.",
    "He had his hat on.",
    "Would you know him again if you saw him\n\nZeropoulos seemed doubtful.",
    "I could not say.",
    "So many Americans come and go.",
    "He was not\nremarkable in any way.",
    "Fournier showed him the collection of snapshots but without avail.",
    "None of them Zeropoulos thought was the man.",
    "Probably a wildgoose chase said Fournier as they left the shop.",
    "It is possible yes agreed Poirot.",
    "But I do not think so.",
    "The price\ntickets were of the same shape and there are one or two points of\ninterest about the story and about M. Zeropoulos remarks.",
    "And now\n\n\fmy friend having been upon one wildgoose chase indulge me and\ncome upon another.",
    "Where to\n\nTo the Boulevard des Capucines.",
    "Let me see.",
    "That is \n\nThe office of Universal Air Lines.",
    "Of course.",
    "But we have already made perfunctory inquiries there.",
    "They could tell us nothing of interest.",
    "Poirot tapped him kindly on the shoulder.",
    "Ah but you see an answer depends on the questions.",
    "You did not\nknow what questions to ask.",
    "And you do\n\nWell I have a certain little idea.",
    "He would say no more and in due course they arrived at the Boulevard\ndes Capucines.",
    "The office of Universal Air Lines was quite small.",
    "A smartlooking dark\nman was behind a highly polished wooden counter and a boy of about\nfifteen was sitting at a typewriter.",
    "Fournier produced his credentials and the man whose name was\nJules Perrot declared himself to be entirely at their service.",
    "At Poirots suggestion the typewriting boy was dispatched to the\nfarthest corner.",
    "It is very confidential what we have to say he explained.",
    "Jules Perrot looked pleasantly excited.",
    "Yes messieurs\n\nIt is this matter of the murder of Madame Giselle.",
    "Ah yes I recollect.",
    "I think I have already answered some questions\non the subject.",
    "Precisely.",
    "Precisely.",
    "But it is necessary to have the facts very exactly.",
    "Now Madame Giselle reserved her place  when\n\nI think that point has already been settled.",
    "She booked her seat by\ntelephone on the seventeenth.",
    "That was for the twelveoclock service on the following day\n\nYes monsieur.",
    "But I understand from her maid that it was on the 845 a.m. service\nthat madame reserved a seat\n\n\fNo no at least this is what happened.",
    "Madames maid asked for the\n845 service but that service was already booked up so we gave her a\nseat on the twelve oclock instead.",
    "Ah I see.",
    "I see.",
    "Yes monsieur.",
    "I see.",
    "I see.",
    "But all the same it is curious.",
    "Decidedly it is curious.",
    "The clerk looked at him inquiringly.",
    "It is only that a friend of mine deciding to go to England at a\nmoments notice went to England on the 845 service that morning\nand the plane was half empty.",
    "M. Perrot turned over some papers.",
    "He blew his nose.",
    "Possibly your friend has mistaken the day.",
    "The day before or the day\nafter \n\nNot at all.",
    "It was the day of the murder because my friend said that if\nhe had missed that plane as he nearly did he would have actually\nbeen one of the passengers in the Prometheus.",
    "Ah indeed.",
    "Yes very curious.",
    "Of course sometimes people do not\narrive at the last minute and then naturally there are vacant places.",
    "And then sometimes there are mistakes.",
    "I have to get in touch with Le\nBourget they are not always accurate.",
    "The mild inquiring gaze of Hercule Poirot seemed to be upsetting to\nJules Perrot.",
    "He came to a stop.",
    "His eyes shifted.",
    "A little bead of\nperspiration came out on his forehead.",
    "Two quite possible explanations said Poirot.",
    "But somehow I fancy\nnot the true explanation.",
    "Dont you think it might perhaps be better to\nmake a clean breast of the matter\n\nA clean breast of what I dont understand you.",
    "Come come.",
    "You understand me very well.",
    "This is a case of murder murder M. Perrot.",
    "Remember that if you please.",
    "If you withhold\ninformation it may be very serious for you  very serious indeed.",
    "The\npolice will take a very grave view.",
    "You are obstructing the ends of\njustice.",
    "Jules Perrot stared at him.",
    "His mouth fell open.",
    "His hands shook.",
    "Come said Poirot.",
    "His voice was authoritative autocratic.",
    "We want\nprecise information if you please.",
    "How much were you paid and who\npaid you\n\nI meant no harm  I had no idea  I never guessed \n\nHow much And who by\n\nFfive thousand francs.",
    "I never saw the man before.",
    "I  this will ruin\nme.",
    "What will ruin you is not to speak out.",
    "Come now we know the worst.",
    "Tell us exactly how it happened.",
    "The perspiration rolling down his forehead Jules Perrot spoke rapidly\nin little jerks\n\nI meant no harm.",
    "Upon my honor I meant no harm.",
    "A man came in.",
    "He\nsaid he was going to England on the following day.",
    "He wanted to\nnegotiate a loan from  from Madame Giselle.",
    "But he wanted their\nmeeting to be unpremeditated.",
    "He said it would give him a better\nchance.",
    "He said that he knew she was going to England on the\nfollowing day.",
    "All I had to do was to tell her the early service was full\nup and to give her Seat No.",
    "2 in the Prometheus.",
    "I swear messieurs\nthat I saw nothing very wrong in that.",
    "What difference could it make that is what I thought.",
    "Americans are like that  they do business in\nunconventional ways.",
    "Americans said Fournier sharply.",
    "Yes this monsieur was an American.",
    "Describe him.",
    "He was tall stooped had gray hair hornrimmed glasses and a little\ngoatee beard.",
    "Did he book a seat himself\n\nYes monsieur.",
    "Seat No.",
    "1.",
    "Next to  to the one I was to keep for\nMadame Giselle.",
    "In what name\n\nSilas  Silas Harper.",
    "Poirot shook his head gently.",
    "There was no one of that name traveling and no one occupied Seat\nNo.",
    "1.",
    "I saw by the paper that there was no one of that name.",
    "That is why I\nthought there was no need to mention the matter.",
    "Since this man did\nnot go by the plane \n\nFournier shot him a cold glance.",
    "You have withheld valuable information from the police he said.",
    "This is a very serious matter.",
    "Together he and Poirot left the office leaving Jules Perrot staring\nafter them with a frightened face.",
    "On the pavement outside Fournier removed his hat and bowed.",
    "I salute you M. Poirot.",
    "What gave you this idea\n\nTwo separate sentences.",
    "One this morning when I heard a man in our\nplane say that he had crossed on the morning of the murder in a nearly\nempty plane.",
    "The second sentence was that uttered by \u00c9lise when she\nsaid that she had rung up the office of Universal Air Lines and that\n\n\fthere was no room on the earlymorning service.",
    "Now those two\nstatements did not agree.",
    "I remembered the steward on the\nPrometheus saying that he had seen Madame Giselle before on the\nearly service so it was clearly her custom to go by the 845 a.m. plane.",
    "But somebody wanted her to go on the twelve oclock  somebody\nwho was already traveling by the Prometheus.",
    "Why did the clerk say\nthat the early service was booked up A mistake Or a deliberate lie I\nfancied the latter.",
    "I was right.",
    "Every minute this case gets more puzzling cried Fournier.",
    "First we\nseem to be on the track of a woman.",
    "Now it is a man.",
    "This American \n\nHe stopped and looked at Poirot.",
    "The latter nodded gently.",
    "Yes my friend he said.",
    "It is so easy to be an American here in\nParis A nasal voice the chewing gum the little goatee the hornedrimmed spectacles  all the appurtenances of the stage American.",
    "He took from his pocket the page he had torn from the Sketch.",
    "What are you looking at\n\nAt a countess in her bathing suit.",
    "You think  But no she is petite charming fragile she could not\nimpersonate a tall stooping American.",
    "She has been an actress yes\n\n\fbut to act such a part is out of the question.",
    "No my friend that idea\nwill not do.",
    "I never said it would said Hercule Poirot.",
    "And still he looked earnestly at the printed page.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nLord Horbury stood by the sideboard and helped himself absentmindedly to kidneys.",
    "Stephen Horbury was twentyseven years of age.",
    "He had a narrow\nhead and a long chin.",
    "He looked very much what he was  a sporting\noutofdoor kind of man without anything very spectacular in the way\nof brains.",
    "He was kindhearted slightly priggish intensely loyal and\ninvincibly obstinate.",
    "He took his heaped plate back to the table and began to eat.",
    "Presently\nhe opened a newspaper but immediately with a frown he cast it\naside.",
    "He thrust aside his unfinished plate drank some coffee and\nrose to his feet.",
    "He paused uncertainly for a minute then with a slight\nnod of the head he left the dining room crossed the wide hall and\nwent upstairs.",
    "He tapped at a door and waited for a minute.",
    "From\ninside the room a clear high voice cried out Come in\n\n\fLord Horbury went in.",
    "It was a wide beautiful bedroom facing south.",
    "Cicely Horbury was in\nbed  a great carvedoak Elizabethan bed.",
    "Very lovely she looked too\nin her rosechiffon draperies with the curling gold of her hair.",
    "A\nbreakfast tray with the remains of orange juice and coffee on it was on\na table beside her.",
    "She was opening her letters.",
    "Her maid was moving\nabout the room.",
    "Any man might be excused if his breath came a little faster when\nconfronted by so much loveliness but the charming picture his wife\npresented affected Lord Horbury not at all.",
    "There had been a time three years ago when the breathtaking\nloveliness of his Cicely had set the young mans senses reeling.",
    "He had\nbeen madly wildly passionately in love.",
    "All that was over.",
    "He had\nbeen mad.",
    "He was now sane.",
    "Lady Horbury said in some surprise\n\nWhy Stephen\n\nHe said abruptly Id like to talk to you alone.",
    "Madeleine Lady Horbury spoke to her maid.",
    "Leave all that.",
    "Get\nout.",
    "The French girl murmured Tr\u00e8s bien mlady shot a quick interested\nlook out of the corner of her eye at Lord Horbury and left the room.",
    "Lord Horbury waited till she had shut the door then he said\n\nId like to know Cicely just exactly what is behind this idea of coming\ndown here\n\nLady Horbury shrugged her slender beautiful shoulders.",
    "After all why not\n\nWhy not It seems to me there are a good many reasons.",
    "His wife murmured Oh reasons.",
    "Yes reasons.",
    "Youll remember that we agreed that as things were\nbetween us it would be as well to give up this farce of living together.",
    "You were to have the town house and a generous  an extremely\ngenerous  allowance.",
    "Within certain limits you were to go your own\nway.",
    "Why this sudden return\n\nAgain Cicely shrugged her shoulders.",
    "I thought it better.",
    "You mean I suppose that its money\n\nLady Horbury said How I hate you Youre the meanest man alive.",
    "Mean Mean you say when its because of you and your senseless\nextravagance that theres a mortgage on Horbury.",
    "Horbury  Horbury  thats all you care for Horses and hunting and\nshooting and crops and tiresome old farmers.",
    "What a life for a\nwoman\n\nSome women enjoy it.",
    "Yes women like Venetia Kerr whos half a horse herself.",
    "You ought to\nhave married a woman like that.",
    "Lord Horbury walked over to the window.",
    "Its a little late to say that.",
    "I married you.",
    "And you cant get out of it said Cicely.",
    "Her laugh was malicious\ntriumphant.",
    "Youd like to get rid of me but you cant.",
    "He said Need we go into all this\n\nVery much God and the old school arent you Most of my friends\nfairly laugh their heads off when I tell them the kind of things you say.",
    "They are quite welcome to do so.",
    "Shall we get back to our original\nsubject of discussion Your reason for coming here.",
    "But his wife would not follow his lead.",
    "She said\n\nYou advertised in the papers that you wouldnt be responsible for my\ndebts.",
    "Do you call that a gentlemanly thing to do\n\n\fI regret having had to take that step.",
    "I warned you you will\nremember.",
    "Twice I paid up.",
    "But there are limits.",
    "Your insensate\npassion for gambling  well why discuss it But I do want to know what\nprompted you to come down to Horbury Youve always hated the\nplace been bored to death here.",
    "Cicely Horbury her small face sullen said I thought it better just\nnow.",
    "Better just now He repeated the words thoughtfully.",
    "Then he asked\na question sharply Cicely had you been borrowing from that old\nFrench money lender\n\nWhich one I dont know what you mean.",
    "You know perfectly what I mean.",
    "I mean the woman who was\nmurdered on the plane from Paris  the plane on which you traveled\nhome.",
    "Had you borrowed money from her\n\nNo of course not.",
    "What an idea\n\nNow dont be a little fool over this Cicely.",
    "If that woman did lend you\nmoney youd better tell me about it.",
    "Remember the business isnt over\nand finished with.",
    "The verdict at the inquest was willful murder by a\nperson or persons unknown.",
    "The police of both countries are at work.",
    "Its only a matter of time before they come on the truth.",
    "The womans\nsure to have left records of her dealings.",
    "If anything crops up to\nconnect you with her we should be prepared beforehand.",
    "We must\nhave Ffoulkes advice on the matter.",
    "Ffoulkes Ffoulkes Wilbraham \n\n\fFfoulkes were the family solicitors who for generations had dealt\nwith the Horbury estate.",
    "Didnt I give evidence in that damned court and say I had never heard\nof the woman\n\nI dont think that proves very much said her husband dryly.",
    "If you\ndid have dealings with this Giselle you can be sure the police will find\nit out.",
    "Cicely sat up angrily in bed.",
    "Perhaps you think I killed her.",
    "Stood up there in that plane and puffed\ndarts at her from a blowpipe.",
    "Of all the crazy businesses\n\nThe whole thing sounds mad Stephen agreed thoughtfully.",
    "But I do\nwant you to realize your position.",
    "What position There isnt any position.",
    "You dont believe a word I\nsay.",
    "Its damnable.",
    "And why be so anxious about me all of a sudden A\nlot you care about what happens to me.",
    "You dislike me.",
    "You hate me.",
    "Youd be glad if I died tomorrow.",
    "Why pretend\n\nArent you exaggerating a little In any case oldfashioned though\nyou think me I do happen to care about my family name.",
    "An outofdate sentiment which you will probably despise.",
    "But there it is.",
    "Turning abruptly on his heel he left the room.",
    "A pulse was beating in his temple.",
    "Thoughts followed each other\nrapidly through his head\n\nDislike Hate Yes thats true enough.",
    "Should I be glad if she died\ntomorrow Id feel like a man whos been let out of prison... What a\nqueer beastly business life is When I first saw her  in Do It Now what a child what an adorable child she looked So fair and so lovely...\nYoung fool I was mad about her  crazy.",
    "She seemed everything that\nwas adorable and sweet.",
    "And all the time she was what she is now vulgar vicious spiteful emptyheaded...",

    "Have you seen that twoyearold of mine I bought at\nChattisleys sale\n\nThey talked horses for some minutes.",
    "Then he said\n\nBy the way Cicelys here.",
    "Here at Horbury\n\nIt was against Venetias code to show surprise but she could not quite\nkeep the undertone of it out of her voice.",
    "Yes.",
    "Turned up last night.",
    "There was a silence between them.",
    "Then Stephen said\n\nYou were at that inquest Venetia.",
    "How  how  er  did it go\n\nShe considered a moment.",
    "Well nobody was saying very much if you know what I mean.",
    "Police werent giving anything away\n\n\fNo.",

    "Stephen Shed always loved Stephen  always since the old days of\ndancing classes and cubbing and birds nesting.",
    "And Stephen had\nbeen fond of her but not fond enough to prevent him from falling\ndesperately wildly madly in love with a clever calculating cat of a\nchorus girl.",
    "Stephen said We could have a marvelous life together.",
    "Pictures floated before his eyes  hunting tea and muffins the smell of\nwet earth and leaves children.",
    "All the things that Cicely could never\nshare with him that Cicely would never give him.",
    "A kind of mist came\nover his eyes.",
    "Then he heard Venetia speaking still in that flat\nemotionless voice\n\nStephen if you care what about it If we went off together.",
    "Cicely\nwould have to divorce you.",
    "He interrupted her fiercely\n\nDo you think Id let you do a thing like that\n\nI shouldnt care.",

    "I wouldnt like him to be different.",
    "Aloud she said Well Stephen Ill be getting along.",

    "Half of her mind searched through the summer days at Juan\nles Pins while the other half thought of Stephen.",
    "Only just as she reached home did memory suddenly pull her halfdreaming brain up with a jerk\n\nThe little man who gave me his seat in the aeroplane.",
    "They said at the\ninquest he was a detective.",
    "And hard on that came another thought\n\nWhat is he doing down here\n\nChapter 13\n\nJane presented herself at Antoines on the morning after the inquest\nwith some trepidation of spirit.",
    "The person who was usually regarded as M. Antoine himself and\nwhose real name was Andrew Leech greeted her with an ominous\nfrown.",
    "It was by now second nature to him to speak in broken English once\nwithin the portals of Bruton Street.",
    "He upbraided Jane as a complete imbecile.",
    "Why did she wish to travel\nby air anyway What an idea Her escapade would do his\nestablishment infinite harm.",

    "I suppose shell be in seventeen\ntantrums as usual.",
    "I hope she hasnt brought that lap dog with her.",
    "A moment later Gladys voice could be heard with its faint faraway\nnotes\n\nGood morning madam.",
    "Not brought your sweet little Pekingese with\nyou Shall we get on with the shampoo and then well be all ready for\nM. Henri.",
    "Jane had just entered the adjoining cubicle where a hennahaired\nwoman was sitting waiting examining her face in the glass and saying\nto a friend\n\n\fDarling my face is really too frightful this morning it really is.",
    "The friend who in a bored manner was turning over the pages of a\nthree weeks old Sketch replied uninterestediy\n\nDo you think so my sweet It seems to me much the same as usual.",
    "On the entrance of Jane the bored friend stopped her languid survey\nof the Sketch and subjected Jane to a piercing stare instead.",
    "Then she said It is darling.",
    "Im sure of it.",
    "Good morning madam said Jane with that airy brightness expected\nof her and which she could now produce quite mechanically and\nwithout any effort whatsoever.",
    "Its quite a long time since weve seen\nyou here.",
    "I expect youve been abroad.",
    "Antibes said the hennahaired woman who in her turn was staring\nat Jane with the frankest interest.",
    "How lovely said Jane with false enthusiasm.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Is it a\nshampoo and set or are you having a tint today\n\nMomentarily diverted from her scrutiny the hennahaired woman\nleaned toward and examined her hair attentively.",
    "I think I could go another week.",
    "Heavens what a fright I look\n\n\fThe friend said Well darling what can you expect at this time of the\nmorning\n\nJane said Ah wait until M. Georges has finished with you.",
    "Tell me  the woman resumed her stare  are you the girl who gave\nevidence at the inquest yesterday The girl who was in the\naeroplane\n\nYes madam.",
    "How too terribly thrilling Tell me about it.",
    "Jane did her best to please\n\nWell madam it was all rather dreadful really.",
    "She plunged into\nnarration answering questions as they came.",
    "What had the old woman\nlooked like Was it true that there were two French detectives aboard\nand that the whole thing was mixed up with the French government\nscandals Was Lady Horbury on board Was she really as goodlooking as everyone said Who did she Jane think had actually done\nthe murder They said the whole thing was being hushed up for\ngovernment reasons and so on and so on.",
    "This first ordeal was only a forerunner of many others all on the same\nlines.",
    "Everyone wanted to be done by the girl who was on the plane.",
    "Everyone was able to say to her friends My dear positively too\nmarvelous.",

    "Yes I should go\nthere if I were you they do your hair very well... Jeanne her name is \n\n\frather a little thing  big eyes.",
    "Shell tell you all about it if you ask her\nnicely.",
    "By the end of the week Jane felt her nerves giving way under the\nstrain.",
    "Sometimes she felt that if she had to go through the recital once\nagain she would scream or attack her questioner with the dryer.",
    "However in the end she hit upon a better way of relieving her feelings.",
    "She approached M. Antoine and boldly demanded a raise of salary.",
    "You ask that You have the impudence When it is only out of\nkindness of heart that I keep you here after you have been mixed up in\na murder case.",
    "Many men less kindhearted than I would have\ndismissed you immediately.",
    "Thats nonsense said Jane coolly.",
    "Im a draw in this place and you\nknow it.",
    "If you want me to go Ill go.",
    "Ill easily get what I want from\nHenris or the Maison Richet.",
    "And who is to know you have gone there Of what importance are you\nanyway\n\nI met one or two reporters at that inquest said Jane.",
    "One of them\nwould give my change of establishment any publicity needed.",
    "Because he feared that this was indeed so grumblingly M. Antoine\nagreed to Janes demands.",
    "Gladys applauded her friend heartily.",
    "Good for you dear she said.",
    "Iky Andrew was no match for you that\ntime.",
    "If a girl couldnt fend for herself a bit I dont know where wed all\nbe.",

    "Ive had to all my life.",
    "Hard lines dear said Gladys.",
    "But keep your end up with Iky\nAndrew.",
    "He likes you all the better for it really.",
    "Meekness doesnt pay\nin this life but I dont think were either of us troubled by too much of\nthat.",
    "Thereafter Janes narrative repeated daily with little variation sank\ninto the equivalent of a part played on the stage.",
    "The promised dinner and theater with Norman Gale had duly come off.",
    "It was one of those enchanting evenings when every word and\nconfidence exchanged seemed to reveal a bond of sympathy and\nshared tastes.",
    "They liked dogs and disliked cats.",

    "It seemed almost miraculous that two people should have so many\npoints of agreement.",
    "One day at Antoines opening her bag Jane let a letter from Norman\nfall out.",
    "As she picked it up with a slightly heightened color Gladys\npounced upon her\n\nWhos your boy friend dear\n\nI dont know what you mean retorted Jane her color rising.",
    "Dont tell me I know that letter isnt from your mothers greatuncle.",
    "I\nwasnt born yesterday.",
    "Who is he Jane\n\nIts someone  a man  that I met at Le Pinet.",
    "Hes a dentist.",
    "A dentist said Gladys with lively distaste.",
    "I suppose hes got very\nwhite teeth and a smile.",
    "Jane was forced to admit that this was indeed the case.",
    "Hes got a very brown face and very blue eyes.",
    "Anyone can have a brown face said Gladys.",
    "It may be the seaside\nor it may be out of a bottle  two and eleven pence at the chemists.",
    "Handsome Men are Slightly Bronzed.",

    "And to think said Jane to herself that I was worrying so that day\ncoming over in the aeroplane.",
    "Everythings turned out beautifully.",
    "Life\nis really too marvelous.",
    "So full of exuberance did she feel that she decided to be extravagant\nand lunch at the Corner House and enjoy the accompaniment of music\nto her food.",
    "She seated herself at a table for four where there were already a\nmiddleaged woman and a young man sitting.",
    "The middleaged woman\nwas just finishing her lunch.",
    "Presently she called for her bill picked up\na large collection of parcels and departed.",
    "Jane as was her custom read a book as she ate.",
    "Looking up as she\nturned a page she noticed the young man opposite her staring at her\nvery intently and at the same moment realized that his face was\nvaguely familiar to her.",
    "Just as she made these discoveries the young man caught her eye\nand bowed.",
    "Excuse me mademoiselle.",
    "You do not recognize me\n\n\fJane looked at him more attentively.",
    "He had a fair boyishlooking face\nattractive more by reason of its extreme mobility than because of any\nactual claim to good looks.",
    "We have not been introduced it is true went on the young man.",
    "Unless you call murder an introduction and the fact that we both gave\nevidence in the coroners court.",
    "Of course said Jane.",
    "How stupid of me I thought I knew your face.",
    "You are \n\nJean Dupont said the man and gave a funny rather engaging little\nbow.",
    "A remembrance flashed into Janes mind of a dictum of Gladys\nexpressed perhaps without undue delicacy\n\nIf theres one fellow after you theres sure to be another.",
    "Seems to be\na law of Nature.",
    "Sometimes its three or four.",
    "Now Jane had always led an austere hardworking life  rather like the\ndescription after the disappearance of girls who were missing  She\nwas a bright cheerful girl with no men friends and so on.",
    "Jane had\nbeen a bright cheerful girl with no men friends.",
    "Now it seemed that\nmen friends were rolling up all round.",
    "There was no doubt about it\nJean Duponts face as he leaned across the table held more than mere\ninterested politeness.",
    "He was pleased to be sitting opposite Jane.",
    "He\nwas more than pleased he was delighted.",
    "Jane thought to herself with a touch of misgiving\n\nHes French though.",
    "Youve got to look out with the French they\nalways say so.",
    "Youre still in England then said Jane and silently cursed herself\nfor the extreme inanity of her remark.",
    "Yes.",
    "My father has been to Edinburgh to give a lecture there and we\nhave stayed with friends also.",
    "But now  tomorrow  we return to\nFrance.",
    "I see.",
    "The police they have not made an arrest yet said Jean Dupont.",
    "No.",
    "Theres not even been anything about it in the papers lately.",
    "Perhaps theyve given it up.",
    "Jean Dupont shook his head.",
    "No no they will not have given it up.",
    "They work silently  he made an\nexpressive gesture  in the dark.",
    "Dont said Jane uneasily.",
    "You give me the creeps.",
    "Yes it is not a very nice feeling  to have been so close when a murder\nwas committed.",
    "He added And I was closer than you were.",
    "I was\nvery close indeed.",
    "Sometimes I do not like to think of that.",
    "Who do you think did it asked Jane.",
    "Ive wondered and wondered.",
    "Jean Dupont shrugged his shoulders.",
    "It was not I.",
    "She was far too ugly\n\nWell said Jane I suppose you would rather kill an ugly woman than\na goodlooking one\n\nNot at all.",
    "If a woman is goodlooking you are fond of her she treats\nyou badly she makes you jealous mad with jealousy.",
    "Good you say\nI will kill her.",
    "It will be a satisfaction.",
    "And is it a satisfaction\n\nThat mademoiselle I do not know.",
    "Because I have not yet tried.",
    "He\nlaughed then shook his head.",
    "But an ugly old woman like Giselle who would want to bother to kill her\n\nWell thats one way of looking at it said Jane.",
    "She frowned.",
    "It\nseems rather terrible somehow to think that perhaps she was young\nand pretty once.",
    "I know I know.",
    "He became suddenly grave.",
    "It is the great tragedy of\nlife  that women grow old.",
    "You seem to think a lot about women and their looks said Jane.",
    "Naturally.",
    "It is the most interesting subject possible.",
    "That seems\nstrange to you because you are English.",
    "An Englishman thinks first of\nhis work  his job he calls it  and then of his sport and last  a good\nway last  of his wife.",
    "Yes yes it is really so.",
    "Why imagine in a little\nhotel in Syria was an Englishman whose wife had been taken ill.",
    "He\nhimself had to be somewhere in Iraq by a certain date.",
    "Eh bien would\nyou believe it he left his wife and went on so as to be on duty in time\nAnd both he and his wife thought that quite natural they thought him\nnoble unselfish.",
    "But the doctor who was not English thought him a\nbarbarian.",
    "A wife a human being  that should come first.",
    "To do ones\njob  that is something much less important.",
    "I dont know said Jane.",
    "Ones work has to come first I suppose.",
    "But why You see you too have the same point of view.",
    "By doing\nones work one obtains money by indulging and looking after a woman\none spends it so the last is much more noble and ideal than the first.",
    "Jane laughed.",
    "Oh well she said I think Id rather be regarded as a mere luxury\nand selfindulgence than be regarded sternly as a first duty.",
    "Id rather\na man felt that he was enjoying himself looking after me than that he\nshould feel I was a duty to be attended to.",
    "No one mademoiselle would be likely to feel that with you.",
    "Jane blushed slightly at the earnestness of the young mans tone.",
    "He\nwent on talking quickly\n\nI have only been in England once before.",
    "It was very interesting to me\nthe other day at the  inquest you call it  to study three young and\ncharming women all so different from one another.",
    "What did you think of us all asked Jane amused.",
    "That Lady Horbury  bah I know her type well.",
    "It is very exotic very\nvery expensive  you see it sitting round the baccarat table  the soft\nface the hard expression  and you know  you know so well what it will\nbe like in say fifteen years.",
    "She lives for sensation that one.",
    "For high\nplay perhaps for drugs.",
    "Au fond she is uninteresting\n\nAnd Miss Kerr\n\nAh she is very very English.",
    "She is the kind that any shopkeeper on\nthe Riviera will give credit to  they are very discerning our\nshopkeepers.",
    "Her clothes are very well cut but rather like a mans.",
    "She walks about as though she owns the earth she is not conceited\nabout it she is just an Englishwoman.",
    "She knows which department of\nEngland different people come from.",
    "It is true I have heard ones like\nher in Egypt.",
    "What The Etceteras are here The Yorkshire Etceteras\nOh the Shropshire Etceteras.",
    "His mimicry was good.",
    "Jane laughed at the drawling wellbred tones.",
    "And then me she said.",
    "And then you.",
    "And I say to myself How nice how very nice it would\nbe if I were to see her again one day.",
    "And here I am sitting opposite\nyou.",
    "The gods arrange things very well sometimes.",
    "Jane said Youre an archaeologist arent you You dig up things.",
    "And she listened with keen attention while Jean Dupont talked of his\nwork.",
    "Jane gave a little sigh at last.",
    "Youve been in so many countries.",
    "Youve seen so much.",
    "It all sounds\nso fascinating.",
    "And I shall never go anywhere or see anything.",
    "You would like that To go abroad To see wild parts of the earth\nYou would not be able to get your hair waved remember.",
    "It waves by itself said Jane laughing.",
    "She looked up at the clock and hastily summoned the waitress for her\nbill.",
    "Jean Dupont said with a little embarrassment\n\nMademoiselle I wonder if you would permit  as I have told you I\nreturn to France tomorrow  if you would dine with me tonight.",
    "Im so sorry.",
    "I cant.",
    "Im dining with someone.",
    "Ah I am sorry  very sorry.",
    "You will come again to Paris soon\n\n\fI dont expect so.",
    "And me I do not know when I shall be in London again It is sad\n\nHe stood a moment holding Janes hand in his.",
    "I shall hope to see you again very much he said and sounded as\nthough he meant it.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nAt about the time that Jane was leaving Antoines Norman Gale was\nsaying in a hearty professional tone\n\nJust a little tender Im afraid.",
    "Tell me if I hurt you.",
    "His expert hand guided the electric drill.",
    "There.",
    "Thats all over... Miss Ross.",
    "Miss Ross was immediately at his elbow stirring a minute white\nconcoction on a slab.",
    "Norman Gale completed his filling and said\n\n\fLet me see its next Tuesday youre coming for those others\n\nHis patient rinsing her mouth ardently burst into a fluent explanation\nShe was going away  so sorry  would have to cancel the next\nappointment.",
    "Yes she would let him know when she got back.",
    "And she escaped hurriedly from the room.",
    "Well said Gale thats all for today.",
    "Miss Ross said Lady Higginson rang up to say she must give up her\nappointment next week.",
    "She wouldnt make another.",
    "Oh and Colonel\nBlunt cant come on Thursday.",
    "Norman Gale nodded.",
    "His face hardened.",
    "Every day was the same.",
    "People ringing up.",
    "Canceled appointments.",
    "All varieties of excuses  going away going abroad got a cold may not\nbe here.",
    "It didnt matter what reason they gave.",
    "The real reason Norman had\njust seen quite unmistakably in his last patients eye as he reached for\nthe drill.",
    "A look of sudden panic.",
    "He could have written down the womans thoughts on paper\n\nOh dear.",
    "Of course he was in that aeroplane when that woman was\nmurdered...",
    "I wonder... You do hear of people going off their heads and\ndoing the most senseless crimes.",
    "It really isnt safe.",
    "The man might be\na homicidal lunatic.",
    "They look the same as other people Ive always\n\n\fheard.",
    "I believe I always felt there was rather a peculiar look in his\neye.",
    "Well said Gale it looks like being a quiet week next week.",
    "Miss\nRoss.",
    "Yes a lot of people have dropped out.",
    "Oh well you can do with a\nrest.",
    "You worked so hard earlier in the summer.",
    "It doesnt look as though I were going to have a chance of working\nvery hard in the autumn does it\n\nMiss Ross did not reply.",
    "She was saved from having to do so by the\ntelephone ringing.",
    "She went out of the room to answer it.",
    "Norman dropped some instruments into the sterilizer thinking hard.",
    "Lets see how we stand.",
    "No beating about the bush.",
    "This business has\nabout done for me professionally.",
    "Funny.",
    "Its done well for Jane.",
    "People come on purpose to gape at her.",
    "Come to think of it thats\nwhats wrong here.",
    "They have to gape at me and they dont like it\nNasty helpless feeling you have in a dentists chair.",
    "If the dentist were\nto run amuck \n\nWhat a strange business murder is Youd think it was a perfectly\nstraightforward issue and it isnt.",
    "It affects all sorts of queer things\nyoud never think of... Come back to facts.",
    "As a dentist I seem to be\nabout done for... What would happen I wonder if they arrested the\nHorbury woman Would my patients come trooping back Hard to say.",
    "Once the rots set in... Oh well what does it matter I dont care.",
    "Yes I\n\n\fdo because of Jane... Janes adorable.",
    "I want her.",
    "And I cant have her\nyet... A damnable nuisance.",
    "He smiled.",
    "I feel its going to be all right.",
    "She cares.",
    "Shell wait...",
    "Damn it I shall\ngo to Canada  yes thats it  and make money there.",
    "He laughed to himself.",

    "Shes sorry \n\n but she may be going to Timbuctoo finished Norman.",
    "Vive les\nrats Youd better look out for another post Miss Ross.",
    "This seems to\nbe a sinking ship.",
    "Oh Mr Gale I shouldnt think of deserting you.",
    "Good girl.",
    "Youre not a rat anyway.",
    "But seriously I mean it.",
    "If\nsomething doesnt happen to clear up this mess Im done for.",
    "Something ought to be done about it said Miss Ross with energy.",
    "I\nthink the police are disgraceful.",
    "Theyre not trying.",
    "Norman laughed.",
    "I expect theyre trying all right.",
    "Somebody ought to do something.",
    "Quite right.",
    "Ive rather thought of trying to do something myself\nthough I dont quite know what.",
    "Oh Mr Gale I should.",
    "Youre so clever.",
    "Im a hero to that girl all right thought Norman Gale.",
    "Shed like to\nhelp me in my sleuth stuff but Ive got another partner in view.",
    "It was that same evening that he dined with Jane.",
    "Half unconsciously he pretended to be in very high spirits but Jane\nwas too astute to be deceived.",
    "She noted his sudden moments of\nabsentmindedness the little frown that showed between his brows\nthe sudden strained line of his mouth.",
    "She said at last\n\nNorman are things going badly\n\nHe shot a quick glance at her then looked away.",
    "Well not too frightfully well.",
    "Its a bad time of year.",
    "Dont be idiotic said Jane sharply.",
    "Jane\n\nI mean it.",
    "Dont you think I can see that youre worried to death\n\n\fIm not worried to death.",
    "Im just annoyed.",
    "You mean people fighting shy \n\nOf having their teeth attended to by a possible murderer.",
    "Yes.",
    "How cruelly unfair\n\nIt is rather.",
    "Because frankly Jane Im a jolly good dentist.",
    "And Im\nnot a murderer.",
    "Its wicked.",
    "Somebody ought to do something.",
    "Thats what my secretary Miss Ross said this morning.",
    "Whats she like\n\nMiss Ross\n\nYes.",
    "Oh I dont know.",
    "Big lots of bones nose rather like a rocking horse\nfrightfully competent.",
    "She sounds quite nice said Jane graciously.",
    "Norman rightly took this as a tribute to his diplomacy.",
    "Miss Ross\nbones were not really quite as formidable as stated and she had an\n\n\fextremely attractive head of red hair but he felt and rightly that it\nwas just as well not to dwell on the latter point to Jane.",
    "Id like to do southing he said.",
    "If I was a young man in a book Id\nfind a clue or Id shadow somebody.",
    "Jane tugged suddenly at his sleeve.",
    "Look theres Mr Clancy  you know the author.",
    "Siting over there by\nthe wall by himself.",
    "We might shadow him.",
    "But we were going to the flicks\n\nNever mind the flicks.",
    "I feel somehow this might be meant.",
    "You said\nyou wanted to shadow somebody and heres somebody to shadow.",
    "You never know.",
    "We might find out something.",
    "Janes enthusiasm was infectious.",
    "Norman fell in with the plan readily\nenough.",
    "As you say one never knows he said.",
    "Whereabouts has he got to in\nhis dinner I cant see properly without turning my head and I dont\nwant to stare.",
    "Hes about level with us said Jane.",
    "Wed better hurry a bit and get\nahead and then we can pay the bill and be ready to leave when he\ndoes.",
    "They adopted this plan.",
    "When at last little Mr Clancy rose and passed\nout into Dean Street Norman and Jane were fairly close on his heels.",
    "In case he takes a taxi Jane explained.",
    "But Mr Clancy did not take a taxi.",
    "Carrying an overcoat over one arm\nand occasionally allowing it to trail on the ground he ambled gently\nthrough the London streets.",
    "His progress was somewhat erratic.",
    "Sometimes he moved forward at a brisk trot sometimes he slowed\ndown till he almost came to a stop.",
    "Once on the very brink of crossing\na road he did come to a standstill standing there with one foot\nhanging out over the curb and looking exactly like a slowmotion\npicture.",
    "His direction too was erratic.",
    "Once he actually took so many rightangle turns that he traversed the same streets twice over.",
    "Jane felt her spirits rise.",
    "You see she said excitedly.",
    "Hes afraid of being followed.",
    "Hes\ntrying to put us off the scent.",
    "Do you think so\n\nOf course.",
    "Nobody would go round in circles otherwise.",
    "Oh\n\nThey had turned a corner rather quickly and had almost cannoned into\ntheir quarry.",
    "He was standing staring up at a butchers shop.",
    "The shop\nitself was naturally closed but it seemed to be something about the\nlevel of the first floor that was riveting Mr Clancys attention.",
    "He said aloud\n\nPerfect.",
    "The very thing.",
    "What a piece of luck\n\nHe took out a little book and wrote something down very carefully.",
    "Then he started off again at a brisk pace humming a little tune.",
    "He was now heading definitely for Bloomsbury.",
    "Sometimes when he\nturned his head the two behind could see his lips moving.",
    "There is something up said Jane.",
    "Hes in great distress of mind.",
    "Hes talking to himself and he doesnt know it.",
    "As he waited to cross by some traffic lights Norman and Jane drew\nabreast.",
    "It was quite true Mr Clancy was talking to himself.",
    "His face looked\nwhite and strained.",
    "Norman and Jane caught a few muttered words\n\nWhy doesnt she speak Why There must be a reason.",
    "The lights went green.",
    "As they reached the opposite pavement Mr\nClancy said\n\nI see now.",
    "Of course.",
    "Thats why shes got to be silenced\n\nJane pinched Norman ferociously.",
    "Mr Clancy set off at a great pace now.",
    "The overcoat dragged\nhopelessly.",
    "With great strides the little author covered the ground\napparently oblivious of the two people on his track.",
    "Finally with disconcerting abruptness he stopped at a house opened\nthe door with a key and went in.",
    "Norman and Jane looked at each other.",
    "Its his own house said Norman.",
    "Fortyseven Cardington Square.",
    "Thats the address he gave at the inquest.",
    "Oh well said Jane.",
    "Perhaps hell come out again by and by.",
    "And\nanyway we have heard something.",
    "Somebody  a woman  is going to\nbe silenced.",
    "And some other woman wont speak.",
    "Oh dear it sounds\ndreadfully like a detective story.",
    "A voice came out of the darkness.",
    "Good evening it said.",
    "The owner of the voice stepped forward.",
    "A pair of magnificent\nmustaches showed in the lamplight.",
    "Eh bien said Hercule Poirot.",
    "A fine evening for the chase is it not\n\nChapter 15\n\n\fOf the two startled young people it was Norman Gale who recovered\nhimself first.",
    "Of course he said.",
    "Its Monsieur  Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Are you still\ntrying to clear your character M. Poirot\n\nAh you remember our little conversation And it is the poor Mr\nClancy you suspect\n\nSo do you said Jane acutely or you wouldnt be here.",
    "He looked at her thoughtfully for a moment.",
    "Have you ever thought about murder mademoiselle Thought about\nit I mean in the abstract  coldbloodedly and dispassionately\n\nI dont think Ive ever thought about it at all until just lately said Jane.",
    "Hercule Poirot nodded.",
    "Yes you think about it now because a murder has touched you\npersonally.",
    "But me I have dealt with crime for many years now.",
    "I have\nmy own way of regarding things.",
    "What should you say the most\nimportant thing was to bear in mind when you are trying to solve a\nmurder\n\nFinding the murderer said Jane.",
    "Norman Gale said Justice.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "There are more important things than finding the murderer.",
    "And\njustice is a fine word but it is sometimes difficult to say exactly what\none means by it.",
    "In my opinion the important thing is to clear the\ninnocent.",
    "Oh naturally said Jane.",
    "That goes without saying.",
    "If anyone is\nfalsely accused \n\nNot even that.",
    "There may be no accusation.",
    "But until one person is\nproved guilty beyond any possible doubt everyone else who is\nassociated with the crime is liable to suffer in varying degrees.",
    "Norman Gale said with emphasis\n\nHow true that is.",
    "Jane said\n\nDont we know it\n\nPoirot looked from one to the other.",
    "I see.",
    "Already you have been finding that out for yourselves.",
    "He became suddenly brisk\n\n\fCome now I have affairs to see to.",
    "Since our aims are the same we\nthree let us combine together I am about to call upon our ingenious\nfriend Mr Clancy.",
    "I would suggest that mademoiselle accompanies me\nin the guise of my secretary.",
    "Here mademoiselle is a notebook and a\npencil for the shorthand.",
    "I cant write shorthand gasped Jane.",
    "But naturally not.",
    "But you have the quick wits the intelligence.",
    "You\ncan make plausible signs in pencil in the book can you not Good.",
    "As\nfor Mr Gale I suggest that he meets us in say an hours time.",
    "Shall we\nsay upstairs at Monseigneurs Bon We will compare notes then.",
    "And forthwith he advanced to the bell and pressed it.",
    "Slightly dazed Jane followed him clutching the notebook.",
    "Gale opened his mouth as though to protest then seemed to think\nbetter of it.",
    "Right he said.",
    "In an hour.",
    "At Monseigneurs.",
    "The door was opened by a rather forbiddinglooking elderly woman\nattired in severe black.",
    "Poirot said.",
    "Mr Clancy\n\nShe drew back and Poirot and Jane entered.",
    "What name sir\n\n\fMr Hercule Poirot.",
    "The severe woman led them upstairs and into a room on the first floor.",
    "Mr Air Kule Prott she announced.",
    "Poirot realized at once the force of Mr Clancys announcement at\nCroydon to the effect that he was not a tidy man.",
    "The room a long one\nwith three windows along its length and shelves and bookcases on the\nother walls was in a state of chaos.",
    "There were papers strewn about\ncardboard files bananas bottles of beer open books sofa cushions\na trombone miscellaneous china etchings and a bewildering\nassortment of fountain pens.",
    "In the middle of this confusion Mr Clancy was struggling with a\ncamera and a roll of films.",
    "Dear me said Mr Clancy looking up as the visitors were announced.",
    "He put the camera down and the roll of films promptly fell on the floor\nand unwound itself.",
    "He came forward with outstretched hand.",
    "Very\nglad to see you Im sure.",
    "You remember me I hope said Poirot.",
    "This is my secretary Miss\nGrey.",
    "How dyou do Miss Grey.",
    "He shook her by the hand and then turned\nback to Poirot.",
    "Yes of course I remember you  at least  now where\nwas it exactly Was it at the Skull and Crossbones Club\n\n\fWe were fellow passengers on an aeroplane from Paris on a certain\nfatal occasion.",
    "Why of course said Mr Clancy.",
    "And Miss Grey too Only I hadnt\nrealized she was your secretary.",
    "In fact I had some idea that she was\nin a beauty parlor  something of that kind.",
    "Jane looked anxiously at Poirot.",
    "The latter was quite equal to the situation.",
    "Perfectly correct he said.",
    "As an efficient secretary Miss Grey has\nat times to undertake certain work of a temporary nature you\nunderstand\n\nOf course said Mr Clancy.",
    "I was forgetting.",
    "Youre a detective  the\nreal thing.",
    "Not Scotland Yard.",
    "Private investigation... Do sit down Miss\nGrey... No not there I think theres orange juice on that chair...",
    "If I\nshift this file... Oh dear now everythings tumbled out.",
    "Never mind...\nYou sit here M. Poirot... Thats right isnt it Poirot...",
    "The backs not\nreally broken.",
    "It only creaks a little as you lean against it.",
    "Well\nperhaps its best not to lean too hard...",
    "Yes a private investigator like\nmy Wilbraham Rice.",
    "The public have taken very strongly to Wilbraham\nRice.",
    "He bites his nails and eats a lot of bananas.",
    "I dont know why I\nmade him bite his nails to start with its really rather disgusting but\nthere it is.",
    "He started by biting his nails and now he has to do it in every\nsingle book.",
    "So monotonous.",
    "The bananas arent so bad you get a bit\nof fun out of them  criminals slipping on the skin.",
    "I eat bananas myself\n thats what put it into my head.",
    "But I dont bite my nails... Have some\nbeer\n\n\fI thank you no.",
    "Mr Clancy sighed sat down himself and gazed earnestly at Poirot.",
    "I can guess what youve come about.",
    "The murder of Giselle.",
    "Ive\nthought and thought about that case.",
    "You can say what you like its\namazing  poisoned darts and a blowpipe in an aeroplane.",
    "An idea I\nhave used myself as I told you both in book and shortstory form.",
    "Of\ncourse it was a very shocking occurrence but I must confess M.\nPoirot that I was thrilled  positively thrilled.",
    "I can quite see said Poirot that the crime must have appealed to\nyou professionally Mr Clancy.",
    "Mr Clancy beamed.",
    "Exactly.",
    "You would think that anyone even the official police could\nhave understood that But not at all.",
    "Suspicion  that is all I got.",
    "Both\nfrom the inspector and at the inquest.",
    "I go out of my way to assist the\ncourse of justice and all I get for my pains is palpable thickheaded\nsuspicion\n\nAll the same said Poirot smiling it does not seem to affect you very\nmuch.",
    "Ah said Mr Clancy.",
    "But you see I have my methods Watson.",
    "If\nyoull excuse my calling you Watson.",
    "No offense intended.",
    "Interesting\nby the way how the technic of the idiot friend has hung on.",
    "Personally\nI myself think the Sherlock Holmes stories greatly overrated.",
    "The\n\n\ffallacies  the really amazing fallacies  that there are in those stories But what was I saying\n\nYou said that you had your methods.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "Mr Clancy leaned forward.",
    "Im putting that inspector  what\nis his name Japp Yes Im putting him in my next book.",
    "You should\nsee the way Wilbraham Rice deals with him.",
    "In between bananas as one might say.",
    "In between bananas  thats very good that.",
    "Mr Clancy chuckled.",
    "You have a great advantage as a writer monsieur said Poirot.",
    "You\ncan relieve your feelings by the expedient of the printed word.",
    "You\nhave the power of the pen over your enemies.",
    "Mr Clancy rocked gently back in his chair.",
    "You know he said I begin to think this murder is going to be a really\nfortunate thing for me.",
    "Im writing the whole thing exactly as it\nhappened  only as fiction of course and I shall call it The Air Mail\nMystery.",
    "Perfect pen portraits of all the passengers.",
    "It ought to sell\nlike wild fire if only I can get it out in time.",
    "Wont you be had up for libel or something asked Jane.",
    "Mr Clancy turned a beaming face upon her.",
    "No no my dear lady.",
    "Of course if I were to make one of the\npassengers the murderer  well then I might be liable for damages.",
    "But that is the strong part of it all  an entirely unexpected solution is\nrevealed in the last chapter.",
    "Poirot leaned forward eagerly.",
    "And that solution is\n\nAgain Mr Clancy chuckled.",
    "Ingenious he said.",
    "Ingenious and sensational.",
    "Disguised as the\npilot a girl gets into the plane at Le Bourget and successfully stows\nherself away under Madame Giselles seat.",
    "She has with her an ampul\nof the newest gas.",
    "She releases this everybody becomes unconscious\nfor three minutes she squirms out fires the poisoned dart and makes\na parachute descent from the rear door of the car.",
    "Both Jane and Poirot blinked.",
    "Jane said Why doesnt she become unconscious from the gas too\n\nRespirator said Mr Clancy.",
    "And she descends into the Channel\n\nIt neednt be the Channel.",
    "I shall make it the French coast.",
    "And anyway nobody could hide under a seat there wouldnt be\nroom.",
    "There will be room in my aeroplane said Mr Clancy firmly.",
    "\u00c9patant said Poirot.",
    "And the motive of the lady\n\nI havent quite decided said Mr Clancy meditatively.",
    "Probably\nGiselle ruined the girls lover who killed himself.",
    "And how did she get hold of the poison\n\nThats the really clever part said Mr Clancy.",
    "The girls a snake\ncharmer.",
    "She extracts the stuff from her favorite python.",
    "Mon Dieu said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He said\n\nYou dont think perhaps it is just a little sensational\n\nYou cant write anything too sensational said Mr Clancy firmly.",
    "Especially when youre dealing with the arrow poison of the South\nAmerican Indians.",
    "I know it was snake juice really but the principle is\nthe same.",
    "After all you dont want a detective story to be like real life\nLook at the things in the papers  dull as ditch water.",
    "Come now monsieur would you say this little affair of ours is dull as\nditch water\n\nNo admitted Mr Clancy.",
    "Sometimes you know I cant believe it\nreally happened.",
    "Poirot drew the creaking chair a little nearer to his host.",
    "His voice\nlowered itself confidentially\n\nMr Clancy you are a man of brains and imagination.",
    "The police as\nyou say have regarded you with suspicion they have not sought your\nadvice.",
    "But I Hercule Poirot desire to consult you.",
    "Mr Clancy flushed with pleasure.",
    "Im sure thats very nice of you.",
    "He looked flustered and pleased.",
    "You have studied the criminology.",
    "Your ideas will be of value.",
    "It would\nbe of great interest to me to know who in your opinion committed the\ncrime.",
    "Well  Mr Clancy hesitated reached automatically for a banana and\nbegan to eat it.",
    "Then the animation dying out of his face he shook his\nhead You see M. Poirot its an entirely different thing.",
    "When youre\nwriting you can make it anyone you like but of course in real life there\nis a real person.",
    "You havent any command over the facts.",
    "Im afraid\nyou know that Id be absolutely no good as a real detective.",
    "He shook his head sadly and threw the banana skin into the grate.",
    "It might be amusing however to consider the case together\nsuggested Poirot.",
    "Oh that yes.",
    "To begin with supposing you had to make a sporting guess who\nwould you choose\n\nOh well I suppose one of the two Frenchmen.",
    "Now why\n\nWell she was French.",
    "It seems more likely somehow.",
    "And they were\nsitting on the opposite side not too far away from her.",
    "But really I dont\nknow.",
    "It depends said Poirot thoughtfully so much on motive.",
    "Of course of course.",
    "I suppose you tabulate all the motives very\nscientifically\n\nI am oldfashioned in my methods.",
    "I follow the old adage Seek whom\nthe crime benefits.",
    "Thats all very well said Mr Clancy.",
    "But I take it thats a little difficult\nin a case like this.",
    "Theres a daughter who comes into money so Ive\nheard.",
    "But a lot of the people on board might benefit for all we know that is if they owed her money and havent got to pay it back.",
    "True said Poirot.",
    "And I can think of other solutions.",
    "Let us suppose\nthat Madame Giselle knew of something  attempted murder shall we\nsay  on the part of one of those people.",
    "Attempted murder said Mr Clancy.",
    "Now why attempted murder\nWhat a very curious suggestion.",
    "In cases such as these said Poirot one must think of everything.",
    "Ah said Mr Clancy.",
    "But its no good thinking.",
    "Youve got to know.",
    "You have reason  you have reason.",
    "A very just observation.",
    "Then he said\n\nI ask your pardon but this blowpipe that you bought \n\nDamn that blowpipe said Mr Clancy.",
    "I wish Id never mentioned it.",
    "You bought it you say at a shop in the Charing Cross Road Do you\nby any chance remember the name of that shop\n\nWell said Mr Clancy it might have been Absoloms  or theres\nMitchell  Smith.",
    "I dont know.",
    "But Ive already told all this to that\npestilential inspector.",
    "He must have checked up on it by this time.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "But I ask for quite another reason.",
    "I desire to\npurchase such a thing and make a little experiment.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "But I dont know that youll find one all the same.",
    "They dont\nkeep sets of them you know.",
    "All the same I can try... Perhaps Miss Grey you would be so obliging\nas to take down those two names\n\n\fJane opened her notebook and rapidly performed a series of  she\nhoped  professionallooking squiggles.",
    "Then she surreptitiously wrote\nthe names in longhand on the reverse side of the sheet in case these\ninstructions of Poirots should be genuine.",
    "And now said Poirot I have trespassed on your time too long.",
    "I will\ntake my departure with a thousand thanks for your amiability.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Not at all said Mr Clancy.",
    "I wish you would have had a\nbanana.",
    "You are most amiable.",
    "Not at all.",
    "As a matter of fact Im feeling rather happy tonight.",
    "Id\nbeen held up in a short story I was writing  the thing wouldnt pan out\nproperly and I couldnt get a good name for the criminal.",
    "I wanted\nsomething with a flavor.",
    "Well just a bit of luck I saw just the name I\nwanted over a butchers shop.",
    "Pargiter.",
    "Just the name I was looking\nfor.",
    "Theres a sort of genuine sound to it  and about five minutes later I\ngot the other thing.",
    "Theres always the same snag in stories.",
    "Why wont\nthe girl speak The young man tries to make her and she says her lips\nare sealed.",
    "Theres never any real reason of course why she\nshouldnt blurt out the whole thing at once but you have to try and\nthink of something thats not too definitely idiotic.",
    "Unfortunately it has\nto be a different thing every time\n\nHe smiled gently at Jane.",
    "The trials of an author\n\n\fHe darted past her to a bookcase.",
    "One thing you must allow me to give you.",
    "He came back with a book in his hand.",
    "The Clue of the Scarlet Petal.",
    "I think I mentioned at Croydon that that\nbook of mine dealt with arrow poison and native darts.",
    "A thousand thanks.",
    "You are too amiable.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I see said Mr Clancy suddenly to Jane that you dont use\nthe Pitman system of shorthand.",
    "Jane flushed scarlet.",
    "Poirot came to her rescue\n\nMiss Grey is very uptodate.",
    "She uses the most recent system\ninvented by a Czechoslovakian.",
    "You dont say so What an amazing place Czechoslovakia must be.",
    "Everything seems to come from there  shoes glass gloves and now a\nshorthand system.",
    "Quite amazing.",
    "He shook hands with them both.",
    "I wish I could have been more helpful.",
    "They left him in the littered room smiling wistfully after them.",
    "Chapter 16\n\nFrom Mr Clancys house they took a taxi to the Monseigneur where\nthey found Norman Gale awaiting them.",
    "Poirot ordered some consomm\u00e9 and a chaudfroid of chicken.",
    "Well said Norman how did you get on\n\nMiss Grey said Poirot has proved herself the supersecretary.",
    "I dont think I did so very well said Jane.",
    "He spotted my stuff when\nhe passed behind me.",
    "You know he must be very observant.",
    "Ah you noticed that This good Mr Clancy is not quite so absentminded as one might imagine.",
    "Did you really want those addresses asked Jane.",
    "I think they might be useful yes.",
    "But if the police \n\nAh the police I should not ask the same questions as the police have\nasked.",
    "Though as a matter of fact I doubt whether the police have\n\n\fasked any questions at all.",
    "You see they know that the blowpipe\nfound in the plane was purchased in Paris by an American.",
    "In Paris An American But there wasnt any American in the\naeroplane.",
    "Poirot smiled kindly on her.",
    "Precisely.",
    "We have here an American just to make it more difficult.",
    "Voil\u0430 tout.",
    "But it was bought by a man said Norman.",
    "Poirot looked at him with rather an odd expression.",
    "Yes he said it was bought by a man.",
    "Norman looked puzzled.",
    "Anyway said Jane it wasnt Mr Clancy.",
    "Hed got one blowpipe\nalready so he wouldnt want to go about buying another.",
    "Poirot nodded his head.",
    "That is how one must proceed.",
    "Suspect everyone in turn and then\nwipe him or her off the list.",
    "How many have you wiped off so far asked Jane.",
    "Not so many as you might think mademoiselle said Poirot with a\ntwinkle.",
    "It depends you see on the motive.",
    "Has there been  Norman Gale stopped and then added\napologetically I dont want to butt in on official secrets but is there\nno record of this womans dealings\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "All the records are burned.",
    "Thats unfortunate.",
    "\u041avidemment But it seems that Madame Giselle combined a little\nblackmailing with her profession of money lending and that opens up\na wider field.",
    "Supposing for instance that Madame Giselle had\nknowledge of a certain criminal offense  say attempted murder on the\npart of someone.",
    "Is there any reason to suppose such a thing\n\nWhy yes said Poirot slowly there is.",
    "One of the few pieces of\ndocumentary evidence that we have in this case.",
    "He looked from one to the other of their interested faces and gave a\nlittle sigh.",
    "Ah well he said.",
    "That is that.",
    "Let us talk of other matters  for\ninstance of how this tragedy has affected the lives of you two young\npeople.",
    "It sounds horrible to say so but Ive done well out of it said Jane.",
    "She related her rise of salary.",
    "As you say mademoiselle you have done well but probably only for\nthe time being.",
    "Even a nine days wonder does not last longer than nine\ndays remember.",
    "Jane laughed.",
    "Thats very true.",
    "Im afraid its going to last more than nine days in my case said\nNorman.",
    "He explained the position.",
    "Poirot listened sympathetically.",
    "As you say he observed thoughtfully it will take more than nine\ndays or nine weeks or nine months.",
    "Sensationalism dies quickly fear\nis longlived.",
    "Do you think I ought to stick it out\n\nHave you any other plan\n\nYes.",
    "Chuck up the whole thing.",
    "Go out to Canada or somewhere and\nstart again.",
    "Im sure that would be a pity said Jane firmly.",
    "Norman looked at her.",
    "Poirot tactfully became engrossed with his chicken.",
    "I dont want to go said Norman.",
    "If I discover who killed Madame Giselle you will not have to go said\nPoirot cheerfully.",
    "Do you really think you will asked Jane.",
    "Poirot looked at her reproachfully.",
    "If one approaches a problem with order and method there should be\nno difficulty in solving it none whatever said Poirot severely.",
    "Oh I see said Jane who didnt.",
    "But I should solve this problem quicker if I had help said Poirot.",
    "What kind of help\n\nPoirot did not speak for a moment or two.",
    "Then he said\n\nHelp from Mr Gale.",
    "And perhaps later help from you also.",
    "What can I do asked Norman.",
    "Poirot shot a sideways glance at him.",
    "You will not like it he said warningly.",
    "What is it repeated the young man impatiently.",
    "Very delicately so as not to offend English susceptibilities Poirot used\na toothpick.",
    "Then he said\n\nFrankly what I need is a blackmailer.",
    "A blackmailer exclaimed Norman.",
    "He stared at Poirot as a man\ndoes who cannot believe his ears.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Precisely he said.",
    "A blackmailer.",
    "But what for\n\nParbleu To blackmail.",
    "Yes but I mean who Why\n\nWhy said Poirot is my business.",
    "As to who  He paused for a\nmoment then went on in a calm businesslike tone\n\nHere is the plan I will outline for you.",
    "You will write a note  that is to\nsay I will write a note and you will copy it  to the Countess of Horbury.",
    "You will mark it Personal.",
    "In the note you will ask for an interview.",
    "You\nwill recall yourself to her memory as having traveled to England by air\n\n\fon a certain occasion.",
    "You will also refer to certain business dealings\nof Madame Giselles having passed into your hands.",
    "And then\n\nAnd then you will be accorded an interview.",
    "You will go and you will\nsay certain things  in which I will instruct you.",
    "You will ask for  let me\nsee  ten thousand pounds.",
    "Youre mad\n\nNot at all said Poirot.",
    "I am eccentric possibly but mad no.",
    "And suppose Lady Horbury sends for the police.",
    "I shall go to prison.",
    "She will not send for the police.",
    "You cant know that.",
    "Mon cher practically speaking I know everything\n\nAnd anyway I dont like it.",
    "You will not get the ten thousand pounds  if that makes your\nconscience any clearer said Poirot with a twinkle.",
    "Yes but look here M. Poirot this is the sort of wildcat scheme that\nmight ruin me for life.",
    "Tatata.",
    "The lady will not go to the police  that I assure you.",
    "She may tell her husband.",
    "She will not tell her husband.",
    "I dont like it.",
    "Do you like losing your patients and ruining your career\n\nNo but \n\nPoirot smiled at him kindly.",
    "You have the natural repugnance yes That is very natural.",
    "You have\ntoo the chivalrous spirit.",
    "But I can assure you that Lady Horbury is not\nworth all this fine feeling to use your idiom she is a very nasty piece of\ngoods.",
    "All the same she cant be a murderess.",
    "Why\n\nWhy Because we should have seen her.",
    "Jane and I were sitting just\nopposite.",
    "You have too many preconceived ideas.",
    "Me I desire to straighten\nthings out and to do that I must know.",
    "I dont like the idea of blackmailing a woman.",
    "Ah mon Dieu what there is in a word There will be no blackmail.",
    "You\nhave only to produce a certain effect.",
    "After that when the ground is\nprepared I will step in.",
    "Norman said\n\nIf you land me in prison \n\nNo no no.",
    "I am very well known at Scotland Yard.",
    "If anything should\noccur I will take the blame.",
    "But nothing will occur other than what I\nhave prophesied.",
    "Norman surrendered with a sigh.",
    "All right.",
    "Ill do it.",
    "But I dont half like it.",
    "Good.",
    "This is what you will write.",
    "Take a pencil.",
    "He dictated slowly.",
    "Voil\u0430 he said.",
    "Later I will instruct you as to what you are to say...\nTell me mademoiselle do you ever go to the theater\n\nYes fairly often said Jane.",
    "Good.",
    "Have you seen for instance a play called Down Under\n\nYes.",
    "I saw it about a month ago.",
    "Its rather good.",
    "An American play is it not\n\n\fYes.",
    "Do you remember the part of Harry played by Mr Raymond\nBarraclough\n\nYes.",
    "He was very good.",
    "You thought him attractive Yes\n\nFrightfully attractive.",
    "Ah il est sex appeal\n\nDecidedly said Jane laughing.",
    "Just that or is he a good actor as well\n\nOh I think he acts well too.",
    "I must go and see him said Poirot.",
    "Jane stared at him puzzled.",
    "What an odd little man he was hopping from subject to subject like a\nbird from one branch to another.",
    "Perhaps he read her thoughts.",
    "He smiled.",
    "You do not approve of me mademoiselle Of my methods\n\n\fYou jump about a good deal.",
    "Not really.",
    "I pursue my course logically with order and method.",
    "One\nmust not jump wildly to a conclusion.",
    "One must eliminate.",
    "Eliminate said Jane.",
    "Is that what youre doing She thought a\nmoment.",
    "I see.",
    "Youve eliminated Mr Clancy.",
    "Perhaps said Poirot.",
    "And youve eliminated us and now youre going perhaps to eliminate\nLady Horbury... Oh\n\nShe stopped as a sudden thought struck her.",
    "What is it mademoiselle\n\nThat talk of attempted murder Was that a test\n\nYou are very quick mademoiselle.",
    "Yes that was part of the course I\npursue.",
    "I mention attempted murder and I watch Mr Clancy I watch\nyou I watch Mr Gale  and in neither of you three is there any sign not\nso much as the flicker of an eyelash.",
    "And let me tell you that I could not\nbe deceived on that point.",
    "A murderer can be ready to meet any attack\nthat he foresees.",
    "But that entry in a little notebook could not have been\nknown to any of you.",
    "So you see I am satisfied.",
    "What a horrible tricky sort of person you are M. Poirot said Jane.",
    "I\nshall never know why you are saying things.",
    "That is quite simple.",
    "I want to find out things.",
    "I suppose youve got very clever ways of finding out things\n\nThere is only one really simple way.",
    "What is that\n\nTo let people tell you.",
    "Jane laughed.",
    "Suppose they dont want to\n\nEveryone likes talking about themselves.",
    "I suppose they do admitted Jane.",
    "That is how many a quack makes a fortune.",
    "He encourages patients\nto come and sit and tell him things  how they fell out of the\nperambulator when they were two and how their mother ate a pear\nand the juice fell on her orange dress and how when they were one\nand a half they pulled their fathers beard and then he tells them that\nnow they will not suffer from the insomnia any longer and he takes two\nguineas and they go away having enjoyed themselves oh so much and perhaps they do sleep.",
    "How ridiculous said Jane.",
    "No it is not so ridiculous as you think.",
    "It is based on a fundamental\nneed of human nature  the need to talk to reveal oneself.",
    "You\n\n\fyourself mademoiselle do you not like to dwell on your childhood\nmemories On your mother and your father\n\nThat doesnt apply in my case.",
    "I was brought up in an orphanage.",
    "Ah that is different.",
    "It is not gay that.",
    "I dont mean that we were the kind of charity orphans who go out in\nscarlet bonnets and cloaks.",
    "It was quite fun really.",
    "It was in England\n\nNo in Ireland near Dublin.",
    "So you are Irish.",
    "That is why you have the dark hair and the bluegray\neyes with the look \n\n as though they had been put in with a smutty finger Norman\nfinished with amusement.",
    "Comment What is that you say\n\nThat is a saying about Irish eyes  that they have been put in with a\nsmutty finger.",
    "Really It is not elegant that.",
    "And yet it expresses it well.",
    "He bowed\nto Jane.",
    "The effect is very good mademoiselle.",
    "Jane laughed as she got up.",
    "Youll turn my head M. Poirot.",
    "Good night and thank you for supper.",
    "Youll have to stand me another if Norman is sent to prison for\nblackmail.",
    "A frown came over Normans face at the reminder.",
    "Poirot bade the two young people good night.",
    "When he got home he unlocked a drawer and took out a list of eleven\nnames.",
    "Against four of these names he put a light tick.",
    "Then he nodded his\nhead thoughtfully.",
    "I think I know he murmured to himself but I have got to be sure.",
    "Il\nfaut continuer.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nMr Henry Mitchell was just sitting down to a supper of sausage and\nmash when a visitor called to see him.",
    "Somewhat to the stewards astonishment the visitor in question was\nthe fullmustachioed gentleman who had been one of the passengers\non the fatal plane.",
    "M. Poirot was very affable very agreeable in his manner.",
    "He insisted\non Mr Mitchells getting on with his supper paid a graceful compliment\nto Mrs Mitchell who was standing staring at him openmouthed.",
    "He accepted a chair remarked that it was very warm for the time of\nyear and then gently came round to the purpose of his call.",
    "Scotland Yard I fear is not making much progress with the case he\nsaid.",
    "Mitchell shook his head.",
    "It was an amazing business sir  amazing.",
    "I dont see what theyve got\nto go on.",
    "Why if none of the people on the plane saw anything its\ngoing to be difficult for anyone afterwards.",
    "Truly as you say.",
    "Terribly worried.",
    "Henrys been over it put in his wife.",
    "Not able to\nsleep of nights.",
    "The steward explained\n\nIts lain on my mind sir something terrible.",
    "The company had been\nvery fair about it.",
    "I must say I was afraid at first I might lose my job.",
    "Henry they couldnt.",
    "It would have been cruelly unfair.",
    "His wife sounded highly indignant.",
    "She was a buxom highly\ncomplexioned woman with snapping dark eyes.",
    "Things dont always happen fairly Ruth.",
    "Still it turned out better than\nI thought.",
    "They absolved me from blame.",
    "But I felt it if you understand\nme.",
    "I was in charge as it were.",
    "I understand your feelings said Poirot sympathetically.",
    "But I assure\nyou that you are overconscientious.",
    "Nothing that happened was your\nfault.",
    "Thats what I say sir put in Mrs Mitchell.",
    "Mitchell shook his head.",
    "I ought to have noticed that the lady was dead sooner.",
    "If Id tried to\nwake her up when I first took round the bills \n\nIt would have made little difference.",
    "Death they think was very\nnearly instantaneous.",
    "He worries so said Mrs Mitchell.",
    "I tell him not to bother his head so.",
    "Whos to know what reason foreigners have for murdering each other\nand if you ask me I think its a dirty trick to have done it in a British\naeroplane.",
    "She finished her sentence with an indignant and patriotic snort.",
    "Mitchell shook his head in a puzzled way.",
    "It weighs on me so to speak.",
    "Every time I go on duty Im in a state.",
    "And then the gentleman from Scotland Yard asking me again and again\n\n\fif nothing unusual or sudden occurred on the way over.",
    "Makes me feel\nas though I must have forgotten something and yet I know I havent.",
    "It\nwas a most uneventful voyage in every way until  until it happened.",
    "Blowpipes and darts  heathen I call it said Mrs Mitchell.",
    "You are right said Poirot addressing her with a flattering air of\nbeing struck by her remarks.",
    "Not so is an English murder committed.",
    "Youre right sir.",
    "You know Mrs Mitchell I can almost guess what part of England you\ncome from\n\nDorset sir.",
    "Not far from Bridport.",
    "Thats my home.",
    "Exactly said Poirot.",
    "A lovely part of the world.",
    "It is that.",
    "London isnt a patch on Dorset.",
    "My folk have been settled at\nDorset for over two hundred years and Ive got Dorset in the blood as\nyou might say.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "He turned to the steward again.",
    "Theres one thing Id\nlike to ask you Mitchell.",
    "The mans brow contracted.",
    "Ive told all that I know indeed I have sir\n\n\fYes yes this is a very trifling matter.",
    "I only wondered if anything on\nthe table  Madame Giselles table I mean  was disarranged\n\nYou mean when  when I found her\n\nYes.",
    "The spoons and forks the saltcellar  anything like that\n\nThe man shook his head.",
    "There wasnt anything of that kind on the tables.",
    "Everything was\ncleared away bar the coffee cups.",
    "I didnt notice anything myself.",
    "I\nshouldnt though.",
    "I was much too flustered.",
    "But the police would know\nthat sir they searched the plane through and through.",
    "Ah well said Poirot it is no matter.",
    "Sometime I must have a word\nwith your colleague Davis.",
    "Hes on the early 845 a.m. service now sir.",
    "Has this business upset him much\n\nOh well sir you see hes only a young fellow.",
    "If you ask me hes\nalmost enjoyed it all.",
    "The excitement And everyone standing him\ndrinks and wanting to hear about it.",
    "Has he perhaps a young lady asked Poirot.",
    "Doubtless his\nconnection with the crime would be very thrilling to her.",
    "Hes courting old Johnsons daughter at the Crown and Feathers\nsaid Mrs Mitchell.",
    "But shes a sensible girl got her head screwed on\nthe right way.",
    "She doesnt approve of being mixed up with a murder.",
    "A very sound point of view said Poirot rising.",
    "Well thank you Mr\nMitchell  and you Mrs Mitchell  and I beg of you my friend do not let\nthis weigh upon your mind.",
    "When he had departed Mitchell said The thick heads in the jury at\nthe inquest thought hed done it.",
    "But if you ask me hes secret\nservice.",
    "If you ask me said Mrs Mitchell theres Bolshies at the back of it.",
    "Poirot had said that he must have a word with the other steward\nDavis sometime.",
    "As a matter of fact he had it not many hours later in\nthe bar of the Crown and Feathers.",
    "He asked Davis the same question he had asked Mitchell.",
    "Nothing disarranged no sir.",
    "You mean upset That kind of thing\n\nI mean  well shall we say something missing from the table or\nsomething that would not usually be there\n\nDavis said slowly\n\nThere was something.",
    "I noticed it when I was clearing up after the\npolice had done with the place.",
    "But I dont suppose that its the sort of\nthing you mean.",
    "Its only that the dead lady had two coffee spoons in\n\n\fher saucer.",
    "It does sometimes happen when were serving in a hurry.",
    "I\nnoticed it because theres a superstition about that they say two\nspoons in a saucer means a wedding.",
    "Was there a spoon missing from anyone elses saucer\n\nNo sir not that I noticed.",
    "Mitchell or I must have taken the cup and\nsaucer along that way  as I say one does sometimes what with the\nhurry and all.",
    "I laid two sets of fish knives and forks only a week ago.",
    "On the whole its better than laying the table short for then you have\nto interrupt yourself and go and fetch the extra knife or whatever it is\nyouve forgotten.",
    "Poirot asked one more question  a somewhat jocular one\n\nWhat do you think of French girls Davis\n\nEnglish is good enough for me sir.",
    "And he grinned at a plump fairhaired girl behind the bar.",
    "Chapter 18\n\nMr James Ryder was rather surprised when a card bearing the name\nof M. Hercule Poirot was brought to him.",
    "He knew that the name was familiar but for the moment he could not\nremember why.",
    "Then he said to himself\n\nOh that fellow And told the clerk to show the visitor in.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot was looking very jaunty.",
    "In one hand he carried a\ncane.",
    "He had a flower in his buttonhole.",
    "You will forgive my troubling you I trust said Poirot.",
    "It is this affair\nof the death of Madame Giselle.",
    "Yes said Mr Ryder.",
    "Well what about it Sit down wont you Have\na cigar\n\nI thank you no.",
    "I smoke always my own cigarettes.",
    "Perhaps you will\naccept one\n\nRyder regarded Poirots tiny cigarettes with a somewhat dubious eye.",
    "Think Ill have one of my own if its all the same to you.",
    "Might swallow\none of those by mistake.",
    "He laughed heartily.",
    "The inspector was round here a few days ago said Mr Ryder when\nhe had induced his lighter to work.",
    "Nosey thats what those fellows\nare.",
    "Cant mind their own business.",
    "They have I suppose to get information said Poirot mildly.",
    "They neednt be so offensive about it said Mr Ryder bitterly.",
    "A\nmans got his feelings and his business reputation to think about\n\n\fYou are perhaps a little oversensitive.",
    "Im in a delicate position I am said Mr Ryder.",
    "Sitting where I did just in front of her  well it looks fishy I suppose.",
    "I cant help where I\nsat.",
    "If Id known that woman was going to be murdered I wouldnt have\ncome by that plane at all.",
    "I dont know though perhaps I would.",
    "He looked thoughtful for a moment.",
    "Has good come out of evil asked Poirot smiling.",
    "Its funny your saying that.",
    "It has and it hasnt in a manner of\nspeaking.",
    "I mean Ive had a lot of worry.",
    "Ive been badgered.",
    "Things\nhave been insinuated.",
    "And why me  thats what I say.",
    "Why dont they\ngo and worry that Doctor Hubbard  Bryant I mean.",
    "Doctors are the\npeople who can get hold of highfaluting undetectable poisons.",
    "Howd I\nget hold of snake juice I ask you\n\nYou were saying said Poirot that although you had been put to a lot\nof inconvenience \n\nAh yes there was a bright side to the picture.",
    "I dont mind telling you\nI cleaned up a tidy little sum from the papers.",
    "Eyewitness stuff  though\nthere was more of the reporters imagination than of my eyesight but\nthats neither here nor there.",
    "It is interesting said Poirot how a crime affects the lives of people\nwho are quite outside it.",
    "Take yourself for example you make\n\n\fsuddenly a quite unexpected sum of money  a sum of money perhaps\nparticularly welcome at the moment.",
    "Moneys always welcome said Mr Ryder.",
    "He eyed Poirot sharply.",
    "Sometimes the need of it is imperative.",
    "For that reason men\nembezzle they make fraudulent entries  he waved his hands  all\nsorts of complications arise.",
    "Well dont lets get gloomy about it said Mr Ryder.",
    "True.",
    "Why dwell on the dark side of the picture This money was\ngrateful to you since you failed to raise a loan in Paris.",
    "How the devil did you know that asked Mr Ryder angrily.",
    "Hercule Poirot smiled.",
    "At any rate it is true.",
    "Its true enough.",
    "But I dont particularly want it to get about.",
    "I will be discretion itself I assure you.",
    "Its odd mused Mr Ryder how small a sum will sometimes put a\nman in Queer Street.",
    "Just a small sum of ready money to tide him over\na crisis.",
    "And if he cant get hold of that infinitesimal sum to hell with\n\n\fhis credit.",
    "Yes its odd.",
    "Moneys odd.",
    "Credits odd.",
    "Come to that life is\nodd\n\nVery true.",
    "By the way what was it you wanted to see me about\n\nIt is a little delicate.",
    "It has come to my ears  in the course of my\nprofession you understand  that in spite of your denials you did have\ndealings with this woman Giselle.",
    "Who says so Its a lie  a damned lie  I never saw the woman\n\nDear me that is very curious\n\nCurious Its a damned libel.",
    "Poirot looked at him thoughtfully.",
    "Ah he said.",
    "I must look into the matter.",
    "What do you mean What are you getting at\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "Do not enrage yourself.",
    "There must be a mistake.",
    "I should think there was.",
    "Catch me getting myself mixed with these\nhightoned society money lenders.",
    "Society women with gambling\ndebts  thats their sort.",
    "Poirot rose.",
    "I must apologize for having been misinformed.",
    "He paused at the\ndoor.",
    "By the way just as a matter of curiosity what made you call\nDoctor Bryant Doctor Hubbard just now\n\nBlessed if I know.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Oh yes I think it must have been the\nflute.",
    "The nursery rime you know.",
    "Old Mother Hubbards dog But\nwhen she came back he was playing the flute.",
    "Odd thing how you mix\nup names.",
    "Ah yes the flute.",
    "These things interest me you understand\npsychologically.",
    "Mr Ryder snorted at the word psychologically.",
    "It savored to him of\nwhat he called that tomfool business psychoanalysis.",
    "He looked at Poirot with suspicion.",
    "Chapter 19\n\nThe Countess of Horbury sat in her bedroom at 115 Grosvenor Square\nin front of her toilet table.",
    "Gold brushes and boxes jars of face cream\nboxes of powder dainty luxury all around her.",
    "But in the midst of the\n\n\fluxury.",
    "Cicely Horbury sat with dry lips and a face on which the rouge\nshowed up in unbecoming patches on her cheeks.",
    "She read the letter for the fourth time.",
    "The Countess of Horbury\n\nDear Madam Re Madame Giselle deceased.",
    "I am the holder of certain documents formerly in the possession of the\ndeceased lady.",

    "Or perhaps you would prefer me to deal with your husband in the\nmatter\n\nYours truly\n\nJohn Robinson.",
    "Stupid to read the same thing over and over again.",
    "As though the\nwords might alter their meaning.",
    "She picked up the envelope  two envelopes  the first with Personal on\nit.",
    "The second with Private and Very Confidential.",
    "Private and Very Confidential.",
    "The beast  the beast.",
    "And\n\nthat\n\nlying\n\nold\n\nFrenchwoman\n\nwho\n\nhad\n\nsworn\n\nthat\n\nAll\n\narrangements were made to protect clients in case of her own\nsudden demise.",
    "Damn her.",
    "Life was hell  hell\n\nOh God my nerves thought Cicely.",
    "It isnt fair.",
    "It isnt fair.",
    "Her shaking hand went out to a goldtopped bottle.",
    "It will steady me.",
    "Pull me together.",
    "She snuffed the stuff up her nose.",
    "There.",
    "Now she could think\n\nWhat to do\n\n\fSee the man of course.",
    "Though where she could raise any money perhaps a lucky flutter at that place in Carios Street \n\nBut time enough to think of that later.",
    "See the man find out what he\nknows.",
    "She went over to the writing table dashed off in her big unformed\nhandwriting\n\nThe Countess of Horbury presents her compliments to Mr John\nRobinson and will see him if he calls at eleven oclock tomorrow\nmorning.",
    "Will I do asked Norman.",
    "He flushed a little under Poirots startled gaze.",
    "Name of a name said Hercule Poirot what kind of a comedy is it\nthat you are playing\n\nNorman Gale flushed even more deeply.",
    "He mumbled You said a slight disguise would be as well.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "Then he took the young man by the arm and marched\nhim to the lookingglass.",
    "Regard yourself he said.",
    "That is all I ask of you  regard yourself\nWhat do you think you are A Santa Claus dressed up to amuse the\nchildren I agree that your beard is not white  no it is black the color\nfor villains.",
    "But what a beard  a beard that screams to heaven A\ncheap beard my friend and most imperfectly and amateurishly\nattached Then there are your eyebrows  but it is that you have the\nmania for false hair The spirit gum one smells it several yards away\nand if you think that anyone will fail to perceive that you have a piece of\nsticking plaster attached to a tooth you are mistaken.",
    "My friend it is\nnot your metier  decidedly not  to play the part.",
    "I acted in amateur theatricals a good deal at one time said Norman\nGale stiffly.",
    "I can hardly believe it.",
    "At any rate I presume they did not let you\nindulge in your own ideas of makeup.",
    "Even behind the footlights your\nappearance would be singularly unconvincing.",
    "In Grosvenor Square in\nbroad daylight \n\nPoirot gave an eloquent shrug of the shoulders by way of finishing the\nsentence.",
    "No mon ami he said.",
    "You are a blackmailer not a comedian.",

    "But I will if you please attach it to you\nmyself...",
    "There... And now we will part the hair differently...",
    "So.",
    "That is\nquite enough.",
    "Now let me see if you at least know your lines.",
    "He listened with attention then nodded.",
    "That is good.",

    "He must not  positively must not  show that\nhe was new to this business.",
    "Mr Robinson said Cicely.",
    "At your service said Norman and bowed.",
    "Damn it all Just like a shopwalker he thought disgustedly.",
    "Thats\nfright.",
    "I had your letter said Cicely.",
    "Norman pulled himself together.",
    "The old fool said I couldnt act he\nsaid to himself with a mental grin.",
    "Aloud he said rather insolently\n\nQuite so.",
    "Well what about it.",
    "Lady Horbury\n\nI dont know what you mean.",
    "Come come.",
    "Must we really go into details Everyone knows how\npleasant a  well call it a weekend at the seaside  can be but\nhusbands seldom agree.",
    "I think you know Lady Horbury just exactly\nwhat the evidence consists of.",
    "Wonderful woman old Giselle.",
    "Always\nhad the goods.",
    "Hotel evidence and so on is quite first class.",
    "Now the\nquestion is who wants it most  you or Lord Horbury Thats the\nquestion.",
    "She stood there quivering.",
    "Im a seller said Norman his voice growing commoner as he threw\nhimself more wholeheartedly into the part of Mr Robinson.",
    "Are you a\nbuyer Thats the question.",
    "How did you get hold of this evidence\n\nNow really.",
    "Lady Horbury thats rather beside the point.",
    "Ive got it thats the main thing.",
    "I dont believe you.",
    "Show it to me.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Norman shook his head with a cunning leer.",
    "I didnt bring\nanything with me.",
    "Im not so green as that.",
    "If we agree to do business\nthats another matter.",
    "Ill show you the stuff before you hand the money\nover.",
    "All fair and aboveboard.",
    "How  how much\n\nTen thousand of the best  pounds not dollars.",
    "Impossible.",
    "I could never lay my hands on anything like that amount.",
    "Its wonderful what you can do if you try.",
    "Jewels arent fetching what\nthey did but pearls are still pearls.",
    "Look here to oblige a lady Ill\nmake it eight thousand.",
    "Thats my last word.",
    "And Ill give you two days\nto think it over.",
    "I cant get the money I tell you.",
    "Norman sighed and shook his head.",
    "Well perhaps its only right Lord Horbury should know whats been\ngoing on.",
    "I believe Im correct in saying that a divorced woman gets no\nalimony and Mr Barracloughs a very promising young actor but hes\nnot touching big money yet.",
    "Now not another word.",
    "Ill leave you to\nthink it over and mind what I say  I mean it.",
    "He paused and then added\n\nI mean it just as Giselle meant it.",
    "Then quickly before the wretched woman could reply he had left the\nroom.",
    "Ouch said Norman as he reached the street.",
    "He wiped his brow.",
    "Thank goodness thats over.",
    "It was a bare hour later when a card was brought to Lady Horbury.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "She thrust it aside.",
    "Who is he I cant see him\n\nHe said mlady that he was here at the request of Mr Raymond\nBarraclough.",
    "Oh.",
    "She paused.",
    "Very well show him in.",
    "The butler departed reappeared.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "Exquisitely dressed in the most dandiacal style M. Poirot entered\nbowed.",
    "The butler closed the door.",
    "Cicely took a step forward.",
    "Mr Barraclough sent you\n\nSit down madame His tone was kindly but authoritative.",
    "Mechanically she sat.",
    "He took a chair near her.",
    "His manner was\nfatherly and reassuring.",
    "Madame I entreat you look upon me as a friend.",
    "I come to advise\nyou.",
    "You are I know in grave trouble.",
    "She murmured faintly I dont \n\n\u041acoutez madame.",
    "I do not ask you to give away your secrets.",
    "It is\nunnecessary.",
    "I know them beforehand.",
    "That is the essence of being a\ngood detective  to know.",
    "A detective.",
    "Her eyes widened.",
    "I remember.",
    "You were on the plane\nit was you \n\n\fPrecisely.",
    "It was me.",
    "Now madame let us get to business.",
    "As I said\njust now I do not press you to confide in me.",
    "You shall not start by\ntelling me things I will tell them to you.",
    "This morning not an hour ago\nyou had a visitor.",
    "That visitor  his name was Brown perhaps.",
    "Robinson said Cicely faintly.",
    "It is the same thing  Brown Smith Robinson  he uses them in turn.",
    "He came her to blackmail you madame.",
    "He has in his possession\ncertain proofs of shall we say indiscretion Those proofs were once\nin the keeping of Madame Giselle.",
    "Now this man has them.",
    "He offers\nthem to you for perhaps seven thousand pounds.",
    "Eight.",
    "Eight then.",
    "And you madame will not find it easy to get that sum very\nquickly\n\nI cant do it  I simply cant do it.",
    "Im in debt already.",
    "I dont know what\nto do.",
    "Calm yourself madame.",
    "I come to assist you.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "How do you know all this\n\nSimply madame because I am Hercule Poirot.",
    "Eh bien have no\nfears.",
    "Place yourself in my hands I will deal with this Mr Robinson.",
    "Yes said Cicely sharply.",
    "And how much will you want\n\nHercule Poirot bowed.",
    "I shall ask only a photograph signed of a very beautiful lady.",
    "She cried out Oh dear I dont know what to do My nerves Im going\nmad\n\nNo no all is well.",
    "Trust Hercule Poirot.",
    "Only madame I must have\nthe truth  the whole truth.",
    "Do not keep anything back or my hands will\nbe tied.",
    "And youll get me out of this mess\n\nI swear to you solemnly that you will never hear of Mr Robinson\nagain.",
    "She said All right.",
    "Ill tell you everything.",
    "Good.",
    "Now then you borrowed money from this woman Giselle\n\nLady Horbury nodded.",
    "When was that When did it begin I mean\n\nEighteen months ago.",
    "I was in a hole.",
    "Gambling\n\n\fYes I had an appalling run of luck.",
    "And she lent you as much as you wanted\n\nNot at first.",
    "Only a small sum to begin with.",
    "And she lent you as much as you wanted\n\nNot at first.",
    "Only a small sum to begin with.",
    "Who sent you to her\n\nRaymond  Mr Barraclough told me that he had heard she lent money\nto society women.",
    "But later she lent you more\n\nYes as much as I wanted.",
    "It seemed like a miracle at the time.",
    "It was Madame Giselles special kind of miracle said Poirot dryly.",
    "I\ngather that before then you and Mr Barraclough had become  er friends\n\nYes.",
    "But you were very anxious that your husband should not know about\nit\n\nCicely cried angrily\n\n\fStephens a prig Hes tired of me He wants to marry someone else.",
    "Hed have jumped at the thought of divorcing me.",
    "And you did not want divorce\n\nNo.",
    "I  I \n\nYou liked your position and also you enjoyed the use of a very ample\nincome.",
    "Quite so.",
    "Les femmes naturally they must look after\nthemselves.",
    "To proceed there arose the question of repayment\n\nYes.",
    "And I  I couldnt pay back the money.",
    "And then the old devil\nturned nasty.",
    "She knew about me and Raymond.",
    "Shed found out\nplaces and dates and everything.",
    "I cant think how.",
    "She had her methods said Poirot dryly.",
    "And she threatened I\nsuppose to send all this evidence to Lord Horbury.",
    "Yes unless I paid up.",
    "And you couldnt pay\n\nNo.",
    "So her death was quite providential\n\nCicely Horbury said earnestly\n\nIt seemed too too wonderful.",
    "Ah precisely  too too wonderful.",
    "But it made you a little nervous\nperhaps\n\nNervous\n\nWell after all madame you alone of anyone on the plane had a\nmotive for desiring her death.",
    "She drew in her breath sharply.",
    "I know.",
    "It was awful.",
    "I was in an absolute state about it.",
    "Especially since you had been to see her in Paris the night before and\nhad had something of a scene with her\n\nThe old devil She wouldnt budge an inch.",
    "I think she actually enjoyed\nit.",
    "Oh she was a beast through and through I came away like a rag.",
    "And yet you said at the inquest that you had never seen the woman\nbefore\n\nWell naturally what else could I say\n\nPoirot looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "You madame could say nothing else.",
    "Its been too ghastly  nothing but lies lies lies.",
    "That dreadful\ninspector man has been here again and again badgering me with\n\n\fquestions.",
    "But I felt pretty safe.",
    "I could see he was only trying it on.",
    "He\ndidnt know anything.",
    "If one does guess one should guess with assurance.",
    "And then continued Cicely pursuing her own line of thought I\ncouldnt help feeling that if anything were to leak out it would have\nleaked out at once.",
    "I felt safe till that awful letter yesterday.",
    "You have not been afraid all this time\n\nOf course Ive been afraid\n\nBut of what Of exposure Or of being arrested for murder\n\nThe color ebbed away from her cheeks.",
    "Murder But I didnt  Oh you dont believe that I didnt kill her.",
    "I\ndidnt\n\nYou wanted her dead.",
    "Yes but I didnt kill her... Oh you must believe me  you must.",
    "I never\nmoved from my seat.",
    "I \n\nShe broke off.",
    "Her beautiful blue eyes were fixed on him imploringly.",
    "Hercule Poirot nodded soothingly.",
    "I believe you madame for two reasons  first because of your sex\nand secondly because of a wasp.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "A wasp\n\nExactly.",
    "That does not make sense to you I see.",
    "Now then let us\nattend to the matter ir hand.",
    "I will deal with this Mr Robinson.",
    "I pledge\nyou my word that you shall never see or hear of him again.",
    "I will settle\nhis  his  I have forgotten the word  his bacon No his goat.",
    "Now in\nreturn for my services I will ask you two little questions.",
    "Was Mr\nBarraclough in Paris the day before the murder\n\nYes we dined together.",
    "But he thought it better I should go and see\nthe woman alone.",
    "Ah he did did he Now madame one further question Your stage\nname before you were married was Cicely Bland.",
    "Was that your real\nname\n\nNo my real name is Martha Jebb.",
    "But the other \n\n made a better professional name.",
    "And you were born  where\n\nDoncaster but why \n\nMere curiosity.",
    "Forgive me.",
    "And now Lady Horbury will you permit\nme to give you some advice Why not arrange with your husband a\ndiscreet divorce\n\n\fAnd let him many that woman\n\nAnd let him marry that woman.",
    "You have a generous heart madame.",
    "And besides you will be safe  oh so safe and your husband he will\npay you an income.",
    "Not a very large one.",
    "Eh bien once you are free you will marry a millionaire.",
    "There arent any nowadays.",
    "Ah do not believe that madame.",
    "The man who had three millions\nperhaps now he has two million  it is still enough.",
    "Cicely laughed.",
    "Youre very persuasive M. Poirot.",
    "And are you really sure that\ndreadful man will never bother me again\n\nOn the word of Hercule Poirot said that gentleman solemnly.",
    "Chapter 20\n\n\fDetective Inspector Japp walked briskly up Harley Street stopped at a\ncertain door and asked for Doctor Bryant.",
    "Have you an appointment sir\n\nNo Ill just write a few words and on an official card he wrote\n\nShould be much obliged if you could spare me a few moments.",
    "I wont\nkeep you long.",
    "He sealed up the card in an envelope and gave it to the butler.",
    "He was shown into a waiting room.",
    "There were two women there and a\nman.",
    "Japp settled down with an elderly copy of Punch.",
    "The butler reappeared and crossing the floor said in a discreet voice\n\nIf you wouldnt mind waiting a short time sir the doctor will see you\nbut hes very busy this morning.",
    "Japp nodded.",
    "He did not in the least mind waiting  in fact he rather\nwelcomed it.",
    "The two women had begun to talk.",
    "They had obviously a\nvery high opinion of Doctor Bryants abilities.",
    "More patients came in.",
    "Evidently Doctor Bryant was doing well in his profession.",
    "Fairly coining money thought Japp to himself.",
    "That doesnt look like\nneeding to borrow but of course the loan may have taken place a long\ntime ago.",
    "Anyway hes got a fine practice a breath of scandal would\nbust it to bits.",
    "Thats the worst of being a doctor.",
    "A quarter of an hour later the butler reappeared and said\n\nThe doctor will see you now sir.",
    "Japp was shown into Doctor Bryants consulting room  a room at the\nback of the house with a big window.",
    "The doctor was sitting at his\ndesk.",
    "He rose and shook hands with the detective.",
    "His finelined face showed fatigue but he seemed in no way disturbed\nby the inspectors visit.",
    "What can I do for you inspector he said as he resumed his seat and\nmotioned Japp to a chair opposite.",
    "I must apologize first for calling in your consulting hours but I shant\nkeep you long sir.",
    "That is all right.",
    "I suppose it is about the aeroplane death\n\nQuite right sir.",
    "Were still working on it.",
    "With any result\n\n\fWere not so far on as wed like to be.",
    "I really came to ask you some\nquestions about the method employed.",
    "Its this snakevenom business\nthat I cant get the hang of.",
    "Im not a toxicologist you know said Doctor Bryant smiling.",
    "Such\nthings arent in my line.",
    "Winterspoons your man.",
    "Ah but you see its like this doctor Winterspoons an expert  and\nyou know what experts are.",
    "They talk so that the ordinary man cant\nunderstand them.",
    "But as far as I can make out theres a medical side\nto this business.",
    "Is it true that snake venom is sometimes injected for\nepilepsy\n\nIm not a specialist in epilepsy either said Doctor Bryant.",
    "But I\nbelieve that injections of cobra venom have been used in the treatment\nof epilepsy with excellent results.",
    "But as I say thats not really my line\nof country.",
    "I know  I know.",
    "What it really amounts to is this I felt that youd take\nan interest having been on the aeroplane yourself.",
    "I thought it\npossible that youd have some ideas on the subject yourself that might\nbe useful to me.",
    "Its not much good my going to an expert if I dont\nknow what to ask him\n\nDoctor Bryant smiled.",
    "There is something in what you say inspector.",
    "There is probably no\nman living who can remain entirely unaffected by having come in close\ncontact with murder.",
    "I am interested I admit.",
    "I have speculated a good\ndeal about the case in my quiet way.",
    "And what do you think sir\n\nBryant shook his head slowly.",
    "It amazes me.",
    "The whole thing seems almost unreal if I might put it\nthat way.",
    "An astounding way of committing a crime.",
    "It seems a chance\nin a hundred that the murderer was not seen.",
    "He must be a person\nwith a reckless disregard of risks.",
    "Very true sir.",
    "The choice of poison is equally amazing.",
    "How could a wouldbe\nmurderer possibly get hold of such a thing\n\nI know.",
    "It seems incredible.",
    "Why I dont suppose one man in a\nthousand has ever heard of such a thing as a boomslang much less\nactually handled the venom.",
    "You yourself sir  now youre a doctor\nbut I dont suppose youve ever handled the stuff.",
    "There are certainly not many opportunities of doing so.",
    "I have a friend\nwho works at tropical research.",
    "In his laboratory there are various\nspecimens of dried snake venoms  that of the cobra for instance  but\nI cannot remember any specimen of the boomslang.",
    "Perhaps you can help me.",
    "Japp took out a piece of paper and\nhanded it to the doctor.",
    "Winterspoon wrote down these three names\nsaid I might get information there.",
    "Do you know any of these men\n\n\fI know Professor Kennedy slightly Heidler I knew well mention my\nname and Im sure hell do all he can for you.",
    "Carmichaels an\nEdinburgh man I dont know him personally but I believe theyve done\nsome good work up there.",
    "Thank you sir Im much obliged.",
    "Well I wont keep you any longer.",
    "When Japp emerged into Harley Street he was smiling to himself in a\npleased fashion.",
    "Nothing like tact he said to himself.",
    "Tact does it.",
    "Ill be bound he\nnever saw what I was after.",
    "Well thats that.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nWhen Japp got back to Scotland Yard he was told that M. Hercule\nPoirot was waiting to see him.",
    "Japp greeted his friend heartily.",
    "Well M. Poirot and what brings you along Any news\n\nI came to ask you for news my good Japp.",
    "If that isnt just like you.",
    "Well there isnt much and thats the truth.",
    "The dealer fellow in Paris has identified the blowpipe all right.",
    "Fourniers been worrying the life out of me from Paris about his\nmoment psychologique.",
    "Ive questioned those stewards till Im blue in\nthe face and they stick to it that there wasnt a moment psychologique.",
    "Nothing startling or out of the way happened on the voyage.",
    "It might have occurred when they were both in the front car.",
    "Ive questioned the passengers too.",
    "Everyone cant be lying.",
    "In one case I investigated everyone was\n\nYou and your cases To tell the truth.",
    "M. Poirot Im not very happy.",
    "The more I look into things the less I get.",
    "The chiefs inclined to look on\nme rather coldly.",
    "But what can I do Luckily its one of those semiforeign cases.",
    "We can put it on the Frenchmen over here and in Paris\nthey say it was done by an Englishman and that its our business.",
    "Do you really believe the Frenchman did it\n\nWell frankly I dont.",
    "As I look at it an archaeologist is a poor kind of\nfish.",
    "Always burrowing in the ground and talking through his hat about\nwhat happened thousands of years ago and how do they know I\nshould like to know Whos to contradict them They say some rotten\nstring of beads is five thousand three hundred and twentytwo years\nold and whos to say it isnt Well there they are liars perhaps though they seem to believe it themselves  but harmless.",
    "I had an old\nchap in here the other day whod had a scarab pinched.",
    "Terrible state\nhe was in  nice old boy but helpless as a baby in arms.",
    "No between\nyou and me I dont think for a minute that pair of French\narchaeologists did it.",
    "Who do you think did it\n\nWell theres Clancy of course.",
    "Hes in a queer way.",
    "Goes about\nmuttering to himself.",
    "Hes got something on his mind.",
    "The plot of a new book perhaps.",
    "It may be that  and it may be something else.",
    "But try as I may I cant\nget a line on motive.",
    "I still think CL 52 in the black book is Lady\nHorbury but I cant get anything out of her.",
    "Shes pretty hardboiled I\ncan tell you.",
    "Poirot smiled to himself.",
    "Japp went on\n\nThe stewards  well I cant find a thing to connect them with Giselle.",
    "Doctor Bryant\n\nI think Im on to something there.",
    "Rumors about him and a patient.",
    "Pretty woman  nasty husband  takes drugs or something.",
    "If hes not\ncareful hell be struck off by the medical council.",
    "That fits in with RT\n362 well enough and I dont mind telling you that Ive got a pretty\nshrewd idea where he could have got the snake venom from.",
    "I went to\nsee him and he gave himself away rather badly over that.",
    "Still so far it\nis all surmise no facts.",
    "Facts arent any too easy to get at in this case.",
    "Ryder seems all square and aboveboard says he went to raise a loan\nin Paris and couldnt get it gave names and addresses all checked up.",
    "Ive found out that the firm was nearly in Queer Street about a week or\n\n\ftwo ago but they seem to be just pulling through.",
    "There you are again\nunsatisfactory.",
    "The whole thing is a muddle.",
    "There is no such thing as muddle  obscurity yes but muddle can\nexist only in a disorderly brain.",
    "Use any word you choose.",
    "The results the same.",
    "Fourniers stumped\ntoo.",
    "I suppose youve got it all taped out but youd rather not tell\n\nYou mock yourself at me.",
    "I have not got it all taped out.",
    "I proceed a\nstep at a time with order and method but there is still far to go.",
    "I cant help feeling glad to hear that.",
    "Lets hear about these orderly\nsteps.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "I make a little table so.",
    "He took a paper from his pocket.",
    "My idea is\nthis A murder is an action performed to bring about a certain result.",
    "Say that again slowly.",
    "It is not difficult.",
    "Probably not but you make it sound so.",
    "No no.",
    "it is very simple.",
    "Say you want money you get it when an aunt\ndies.",
    "Bien.",
    "You perform an action  this is to kill the aunt  and get the\nresult  inherit the money.",
    "I wish I had some aunts like that sighed Japp.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "I see your\nidea.",
    "You mean theres got to be a motive.",
    "I prefer my own way of putting it.",
    "An action is performed  the action\nbeing murder.",
    "What now are the results of that action By studying the\ndifferent results we should get the answer to our conundrum.",
    "The\nresults of a single action may be very varied that particular action\naffects a lot of different people.",
    "Eh bien I study today  three weeks\nafter the crime  the result in eleven different cases.",
    "He spread out the paper.",
    "Japp leaned forward with some interest and read over Poirots\nshoulder.",
    "Miss Grey.",
    "Result  temporary improvement.",
    "Increased salary.",
    "Mr Gale.",
    "Result  bad.",
    "Loss of practice.",
    "Lady Horbury.",
    "Result  good if shes CL 52.",
    "Miss Kerr.",
    "Result  bad since Giselles death makes it more unlikely\nLord Horbury will get the evidence to divorce his wife.",
    "Hm.",
    "Japp interrupted his scrutiny.",
    "So you think shes keen on his\nlordship You are a one for nosing out love affairs.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "Japp bent over the chart once more.",
    "Mr Clancy.",
    "Result  good.",
    "Expects to make money by book dealing with\nthe murder.",
    "Doctor Bryant.",
    "Result  good if RT 362.",
    "Mr Ryder.",
    "Result  good owing to small amount of cash obtained\nthrough articles on murder which tided firm over delicate time.",
    "Also\ngood if Ryder is XVB 724.",

    "Result  the same.",
    "Mitchell.",
    "Result  unaffected.",
    "Davis.",
    "Result  unaffected.",
    "And you think thats going to help you asked Japp skeptically.",
    "I\ncant see that writing down I dont know.",
    "I dont know.",
    "I cant tell\nmakes it any better.",
    "It gives one a clear classification explained Poirot.",
    "In four cases Mr Clancy Miss Grey Mr Ryder and I think I may say Lady Horbury \n\n\fthere is a result on the credit side.",
    "In the cases of Mr Gale and Miss\nKerr there is a result on the debit side in four cases there is no result\nat all so far as we know and in one  Doctor Bryant  there is either no\nresult or a distinct gain.",
    "And so asked Japp.",
    "And so said Poirot we must go on seeking.",
    "With precious little to go upon said Japp gloomily.",
    "The truth of it is\nthat were hung up until we can get what we want from Paris.",
    "Its the\nGiselle side that wants going into.",
    "I bet I could have got more out of\nthat maid than Fournier did.",
    "I doubt it my friend.",
    "The most interesting thing about this case is the\npersonality of the dead woman.",
    "A woman without friends without\nrelations  without as one might say any personal life.",
    "A woman who\nwas once young who once loved and suffered and then with a firm\nhand pulled down the shutter  all that was over Not a photograph not\na souvenir not a knickknack.",
    "Marie Morisot became Madame Giselle\nmoney lender.",
    "Do you think there is a clue in her past\n\nPerhaps.",
    "Well we could do with it There arent any clues in this case.",
    "Oh yes my friend there are.",
    "The blowpipe of course.",
    "No no not the blowpipe.",
    "Well lets hear your ideas of the clues in the case.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "I will give them titles like the names of Mr Clancys stories The Clue\nof the Wasp.",
    "The Clue in the Passengers Baggage.",
    "The Clue of the\nExtra Coffee Spoon.",
    "Youre potty said Japp kindly.",
    "And added\n\nWhats this about a coffee spoon\n\nMadame Giselle had two spoons in her saucer.",
    "Thats supposed to mean a wedding.",
    "In this case said Poirot it meant a funeral.",
    "Chapter 22\n\n\fWhen Norman Gale Jane and Poirot met for dinner on the night after\nthe blackmailing incident Norman was relieved to hear that his\nservices as Mr Robinson were no longer required.",
    "He is dead the good Mr Robinson said Poirot.",
    "He raised his glass.",
    "Let us drink to his memory.",
    "R.I.P.",
    "said Norman with a laugh.",
    "What happened asked Jane of Poirot.",
    "He smiled at her.",
    "I found out what I wanted to know.",
    "Was she mixed up with Giselle\n\nYes.",
    "That was pretty clear from my interview with her said Norman.",
    "Quite so said Poirot.",
    "But I wanted a full and detailed story.",
    "And you got it\n\nI got it.",
    "They both looked at him inquiringly but Poirot in a provoking manner\nbegan to discuss the relationship between a career and a life.",
    "There are not so many round pegs in square holes one might think.",
    "Most people in spite of what they tell you choose the occupation that\nthey secretly desire.",
    "You will hear a man say who works in an office I\nshould like to explore to rough it in far countries.",
    "But you will find that\nhe likes reading the fiction that deals with that subject but that he\nhimself prefers the safety and moderate comfort of an office stool.",
    "According to you said Jane my desire for foreign travel isnt\ngenuine.",
    "Messing about with womens heads is my true vocation.",
    "Well\nthat isnt true.",
    "Poirot smiled at her.",
    "You are young still.",
    "Naturally one tries this that and the other but\nwhat one eventually settles down into is the life one prefers.",
    "And suppose I prefer being rich\n\nAh that it is more difficult\n\nI dont agree with you said Gale.",
    "Im a dentist by chance not\nchoice.",
    "My uncle was a dentist he wanted me to come in with him but\nI was all for adventure and seeing the world.",
    "I chucked dentistry and\nwent off to farm in South Africa.",
    "However that wasnt much good I\nhadnt had enough experience.",
    "I had to accept the old mans offer and\ncome and set up business with him.",
    "And now you are thinking of chucking dentistry again and going off to\nCanada.",
    "You have a Dominion complex\n\n\fThis time I shall be forced to do it.",
    "Ah but it is incredible how often things force one to do the thing one\nwould like to do.",
    "Nothings forcing me to travel said Jane wistfully.",
    "I wish it would.",
    "Eh bien I make you an offer here and now.",
    "I go to Paris next week.",
    "If\nyou like you can take the job of my secretary.",
    "I will give you a good\nsalary.",
    "Jane shook her head.",
    "I mustnt give up Antoines.",
    "Its a good job.",
    "So is mine a good job.",
    "Yes but its only temporary.",
    "I will obtain you another post of the same kind.",
    "Thanks but I dont think Ill risk it.",
    "Poirot looked at her and smiled enigmatically.",
    "Three days later he was rung up.",
    "M. Poirot said Jane is that job still open\n\nBut yes.",
    "I go to Paris on Monday.",
    "You really mean it I can come\n\nYes but what has happened to make you change your mind\n\nIve had a row with Antoine.",
    "As a matter of fact I lost my temper with\na customer.",
    "She was an  an absolute  Well I cant say just what she\nwas through the telephone.",
    "I was feeling nervy and instead of doing\nmy soothingsirup stuff I just let rip and told her exactly what I thought\nof her.",
    "Ah the thought of the great wideopen spaces.",
    "Whats that you say\n\nI say that your mind was dwelling on a certain subject.",
    "It wasnt my mind it was my tongue that slipped.",
    "I enjoyed it.",
    "Her eyes\nlooked just like her beastly Pekingeses  as though they were going to\ndrop out  but here I am thrown out on my ear as you might say.",
    "I must\nget another job sometime I suppose but Id like to come to Paris first.",
    "Good it is arranged.",
    "On the way over I will give you your\ninstructions.",
    "Poirot and his new secretary did not travel by air for which Jane was\nsecretly thankful.",
    "The unpleasant experience of her last trip had\nshaken her nerve.",
    "She did not want to be reminded of that lolling figure\nin rusty black.",
    "On their way from Calais to Paris they had the compartment to\nthemselves and Poirot gave Jane some idea of his plans.",
    "There are several people in Paris that I have to see.",
    "There is the\nlawyer  Ma\u043etre Thibault.",
    "There is also M. Fournier of the S\u044bret\u00e9  a\nmelancholy man but intelligent.",
    "And there are M. Dupont p\u00e9re and M.\nDupont fils.",
    "Now Mademoiselle Jane whilst I am taking on the father I\nshall leave the son to you.",
    "You are very charming very attractive.",
    "I\nfancy that M. Dupont will remember you from the inquest.",
    "Ive seen him since then said Jane her color rising slightly.",
    "Indeed And how was that\n\nJane her color rising a little more described their meeting in the\nCorner House.",
    "Excellent better and better.",
    "Ah it was a famous idea of mine to bring\nyou to Paris with me.",
    "Now listen carefully Mademoiselle Jane.",
    "As far\nas possible do not discuss the Giselle affair but do not avoid the\nsubject if Jean Dupont introduces.",
    "It might be well if without actually\nsaying so you could convey the impression that Lady Horbury is\nsuspected of the crime.",
    "My reason for coming to Paris you can say is\nto confer with M. Fournier and to inquire particularly into any dealings\nLady Horbury may have had with the dead woman.",
    "Poor Lady Horbury.",
    "You do make her a stalking horse\n\nShe is not the type I admire.",
    "Eh bien let her be useful for once.",
    "Jane hesitated for a minute then said\n\nYou dont suspect young M. Dupont of the crime do you\n\nNo no no.",
    "I desire information merely.",
    "He looked at her sharply.",
    "He\nattracts you eh this young man Il est sex appeal\n\nJane laughed at the phrase.",
    "No thats not how I would describe him.",
    "Hes very simple but rather a\ndear.",
    "So that is how you describe him  very simple\n\nHe is simple.",
    "I think its because hes led a nice unworldly life.",
    "True said Poirot.",
    "He has not for instance dealt with teeth.",
    "He has\nnot been disillusioned by the sight of a public hero shivering with fright\nin the dentists chair.",
    "Jane laughed.",
    "I dont think Normans roped in any public heroes yet as patients.",
    "It would have been a waste since he is going to Canada.",
    "Hes talking of New Zealand now.",
    "He thinks Id like the climate\nbetter.",
    "At all events he is patriotic.",
    "He sticks to the British Dominions.",
    "Im hoping said Jane that it wont be necessary.",
    "She fixed Poirot with an inquiring eye.",
    "Meaning that you put your trust in Papa Poirot Ah well I will do the\nbest I can that I promise you.",
    "But I have the feeling very strongly\nmademoiselle that there is a figure who has not yet come into the\nlimelight  a part as yet unplayed.",
    "He shook his head frowning.",
    "There is mademoiselle an unknown factor in this case.",
    "Everything\npoints to that.",
    "Two days after their arrival in Paris M. Hercule Poirot and his\nsecretary dined in a small restaurant and the two Duponts father and\nson were Poirots guests.",
    "Old M. Dupont Jane found as charming as his son but she got little\nchance of talking to him.",
    "Poirot monopolized him severely from the\nstart.",
    "Jane found Jean no less easy to get on with than she had done in\nLondon.",
    "His attractive boyish personality pleased her now as it had\nthen.",
    "He was such a simple friendly soul.",
    "All the same even while she laughed and talked with him her ear was\nalert to catch snatches of the two older mens conversation.",
    "She\nwondered precisely what information it was that Poirot wanted.",
    "So far\n\n\fas she could hear the conversation had never touched once on the\nmurder.",
    "Poirot was skillfully drawing out his companion on the subject\nof the past.",
    "His interest in archaeological research in Persia seemed\nboth deep and sincere.",
    "M. Dupont was enjoying his evening\nenormously.",
    "Seldom did he get such an intelligent and sympathetic\nlistener.",
    "Whose suggestion it was that the two young people should go to a\ncinema was not quite clear but when they had gone Poirot drew his\nchair a little closer to the table and seemed prepared to take a still\nmore practical interest in archaeological research.",
    "I comprehend he said.",
    "Naturally it is a great anxiety in these\ndifficult days to raise sufficient funds.",
    "You accept private donations\n\nM. Dupont laughed.",
    "My dear friend we sue for them practically on bended knees But our\nparticular type of dig does not attract the great mass of humanity.",
    "They demand spectacular results Above all they like gold  large\nquantities of gold It is amazing how little the average person cares for\npottery.",
    "Pottery  the whole romance of humanity can be expressed in\nterms of pottery.",
    "Design texture \n\nM. Dupont was well away.",
    "He besought Poirot not to be led astray by\nthe specious publications of B the really criminal misdating of L\nand the hopelessly unscientific stratification of G. Poirot promised\nsolemnly not to be led astray by any of the publications of these\nlearned personages.",
    "Then he said\n\nWould a donation for instance of five hundred pounds \n\nM. Dupont nearly fell across the table in his excitement\n\nYou  you are offering that To me To aid our researches But it is\nmagnificent Stupendous The biggest private donation we have had\n\nPoirot coughed.",
    "I will admit there is a favor \n\nAh yes a souvenir  some specimen of pottery.",
    "No no you misunderstand me said Poirot quickly before M. Dupont\ncould get well away again.",
    "It is my secretary  that charming young\ngirl you saw tonight  if she could accompany you on your expedition\n\nM. Dupont seemed slightly taken aback for a moment.",
    "Well he said pulling his mustache it might possibly be arranged.",
    "I\nshould have to consult my son.",
    "My nephew and his wife are to\naccompany us.",
    "It was to have been a family party.",
    "However I will\nspeak to Jean.",
    "Mademoiselle Grey is passionately interested in pottery.",
    "The past has\nfor her an immense fascination.",
    "It is the dream of her life to dig.",
    "Also\nshe mends socks and sews on buttons in a manner truly admirable.",
    "A useful accomplishment.",
    "Is it not And now you were telling me about the pottery of Susa.",
    "M. Dupont resumed a happy monologue on his own particular theories\nof Susa I and Susa II.",
    "Poirot reached his hotel to find Jane saying good night to Jean Dupont\nin the hall.",
    "As they went up in the lift Poirot said I have obtained for you a job of\ngreat interest.",
    "You are to accompany the Duponts to Persia in the\nspring.",
    "Jane stared at him.",
    "Are you quite mad\n\nWhen the offer is made to you you will accept with every\nmanifestation of delight.",
    "I am certainly not going to Persia.",
    "I shall be in Muswell Hill or New\nZealand with Norman.",
    "Poirot twinkled at her gently.",
    "My dear child he said it is some months to next March.",
    "To express\ndelight is not to buy a ticket.",
    "In the same way I have talked about a\ndonation but I have not actually signed a check By the way I must\nobtain for you in the morning a handbook on prehistoric pottery of the\n\n\fNear East.",
    "I have said that you are passionately interested in the\nsubject.",
    "Jane sighed.",
    "Being secretary to you is no sinecure is it Anything else\n\nYes.",
    "I have said that you sew on buttons and darn socks to\nperfection.",
    "Do I have to give a demonstration of that tomorrow too\n\nIt would be as well perhaps said Poirot if they took my word for it.",
    "Chapter 23\n\nAt half past ten on the following morning the melancholy M. Fournier\nwalked in to Poirots sitting room and shook the little Belgian warmly\nby the hand.",
    "His own manner was far more animated than usual.",
    "Monsieur he said there is something I want to tell you.",
    "I have I\nthink at last seen the point of what you said in London about the\nfinding of the blowpipe.",
    "Ah Poirots face lighted up.",
    "Yes said Fournier taking a chair.",
    "I pondered much over what you\nhad said.",
    "Again and again I say to myself Impossible that the crime\nshould have been committed as we believe.",
    "And at last  at last I see a\nconnection between that repetition of mine and what you said about\nthe finding of the blowpipe.",
    "Poirot listened attentively but said nothing.",
    "That day in London you said Why was the blowpipe found when it\nmight so easily have been passed out through the ventilator And I\nthink now that I have the answer The blowpipe was found because the\nmurderer wanted it to be found.",
    "Bravo said Poirot.",
    "That was your meaning then Good.",
    "I thought so And I went on a step\nfurther.",
    "I ask myself Why did the murderer want the blowpipe to be\nfound And to that I got the answer Because the blowpipe was not\nused.",
    "Bravo Bravo My reasoning exactly.",
    "I say to myself The poisoned dart yes but not the blowpipe.",
    "Then\nsomething else was used to send that dart through the air  something\nthat a man or woman might put to their lips in a normal manner and\nwhich would cause no remark.",
    "And I remembered your insistence on a\ncomplete list of all that was found in the passengers luggage and upon\ntheir persons.",
    "There were two things that especially attracted my\n\n\fattention  Lady Horbury had two cigarette holders and on the table in\nfront of the Duponts were a number of Kurdish pipes.",
    "M. Fournier paused.",
    "He looked at Poirot.",
    "Poirot did not speak.",
    "Both those things could have been put to the lips naturally without\nanyone remarking on it.",
    "I am right am I not\n\nPoirot hesitated then he said\n\nYou are on the right track yes but go a little further.",
    "And do not\nforget the wasp.",
    "The wasp Fournier stared.",
    "No there I do not follow you.",
    "I cannot\nsee where the wasp comes in.",
    "You cannot see But it is there that I \n\nHe broke off as the telephone rang.",
    "He took up the receiver.",
    "All\u0444.",
    "All\u0444... Ah good morning...",
    "Yes it is I myself Hercule Poirot.",
    "In\nan aside to Fournier he said It is Thibault...",
    "Yes yes indeed...",
    "Very well.",
    "And you... M. Fournier... Quite right...",
    "Yes he has arrived.",
    "He is here at this moment.",
    "Lowering the receiver he said to Fournier\n\n\fHe tried to get you at the S\u044bret\u00e9.",
    "They told him that you had come to\nsee me here.",
    "You had better speak to him.",
    "He sounds excited.",
    "Fournier took the telephone.",
    "All\u0444.",
    "All\u0444...",
    "Yes it is Fournier speaking...What What...",
    "In verity is\nthat so...",
    "Yes indeed...",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I am sure he will.",
    "We will come\nround at once.",
    "He replaced the telephone on its hook and looked across at Poirot.",
    "It is the daughter.",
    "The daughter of Madame Giselle.",
    "What\n\nYes she has arrived to claim her heritage.",
    "Where has she come from\n\nAmerica I understand.",
    "Thibault has asked her to return at half past\neleven.",
    "He suggests we should go round and see him.",
    "Most certainly.",
    "We will go immediately.",
    "I will leave a note for\nMademoiselle Grey.",
    "He wrote\n\n\fSome developments have occurred which force me to go out.",
    "If M.\nJean Dupont should ring up or call be amiable to him.",
    "Talk of buttons\nand socks but not as yet of prehistoric pottery.",
    "He admires you but he\nis intelligent\n\nAu revoir.",
    "Hercule Poirot.",
    "And now let us come my friend he said rising.",
    "This is what I have\nbeen waiting for  the entry on the scene of the shadowy figure of\nwhose presence I have been conscious all along.",
    "Now soon I ought to\nunderstand everything.",
    "Ma\u043etre Thibault received Poirot and Fournier with great affability.",
    "After an interchange of compliments and polite questions and\nanswers the lawyer settled down to the discussion of Madame\nGiselles heiress.",
    "I received a letter yesterday he said.",
    "And this morning the young\nlady herself called upon me.",
    "What age is Mademoiselle Morisot\n\n\fMademoiselle Morisot  or rather Mrs Richards for she is married  is\nexactly twentyfour years of age.",
    "She brought documents to prove her identity said Fournier.",
    "Certainly.",
    "Certainly.",
    "He opened a file at his elbow.",
    "To begin with there is this.",
    "It was a copy of a marriage certificate between George Leman\nbachelor and Marie Morisot both of Quebec.",
    "Its date was 1910.",
    "There\nwas also the birth certificate of Anne Morisot Leman.",
    "There were\nvarious other documents and papers.",
    "This throws a certain light on the early life of Madame Giselle said\nFournier.",
    "Thibault nodded.",
    "As far as I can piece it out he said Marie Morisot was nursery\ngoverness or sewing maid when she met this man Leman.",
    "He was I gather a bad lot who deserted her soon after the marriage\nand she resumed her maiden name.",
    "The child was received in the Institut de Marie at Quebec and was\nbrought up there.",
    "Marie Morisot or Leman left Quebec shortly\n\n\fafterwards  I imagine with a man  and came to France.",
    "She remitted\nsums of money from time to time and finally dispatched a lump sum of\nready money to be given to the child on attaining the age of twentyone.",
    "At that time Marie Morisot or Leman was no doubt living an\nirregular life and considered it better to sunder any personal\nrelations.",
    "How did the girl realize that she was the heiress to a fortune\n\nWe have inserted discreet advertisements in various journals.",
    "It\nseems one of these came to the notice of the principal of the Institut de\nMarie and she wrote or telegraphed to Mrs Richards who was then in\nEurope but on the point of returning to the States.",
    "Who is Richards\n\nI gather he is an American or Canadian from Detroit by profession a\nmaker of surgical instruments.",
    "He did not accompany his wife\n\nNo he is still in America.",
    "Is Mrs Richards able to throw any light upon a possible reason for her\nmothers murder\n\nThe lawyer shook his head.",
    "She knows nothing about her.",
    "In fact although she had once heard\nthe principal mention it she did not even remember what her mothers\nmaiden name was.",
    "It looks said Fournier as though her appearance on the scene is\nnot going to be of any help in solving the murder problem.",
    "Not I must\nadmit that I ever thought it would.",
    "I am on quite another tack at\npresent.",
    "My inquiries have narrowed down to a choice of three\npersons.",
    "Four said Poirot.",
    "You think four\n\nIt is not I who say four.",
    "But on the theory that you advanced to me you\ncannot confine yourself to three persons.",
    "He made a sudden rapid\nmotion with his hands.",
    "The two cigarette holders the Kurdish pipes\nand a flute.",
    "Remember the flute my friend.",
    "Fournier gave an exclamation but at that moment the door opened\nand an aged clerk mumbled\n\nThe lady has returned.",
    "Ah said Thibault.",
    "Now you will be able to see the heiress for\nyourself... Come in madame.",
    "Let me present to you M. Fournier of the\nS\u044bret\u00e9 who is in charge in this country of the inquiries into your\nmothers death.",
    "This is M. Hercule Poirot whose name may be familiar\nto you and who is kindly giving us his assistance.",
    "Madame Richards.",
    "Giselles daughter was a dark chiclooking young woman.",
    "She was\nvery smartly though plainly dressed.",
    "She held out her hand to each of the men in turn murmuring a few\nappreciative words.",
    "Though I fear messieurs that I have hardly the feeling of a daughter\nin the matter.",
    "I have been to all intents and purposes an orphan all my\nlife.",
    "In answer to Fourniers questions she spoke warmly and gratefully of\nM\u00e8re Ang\u00e9lique the head of the Institut de Marie.",
    "She has always been kindness itself to me.",
    "You left the Institut  when madame\n\nWhen I was eighteen monsieur.",
    "I started to earn my living.",
    "I was for a\ntime a manicurist.",
    "I have also been in a dressmakers establishment.",
    "I\nmet my husband in Nice.",
    "He was then just returning to the States.",
    "He\ncame over again on business to Holland and we were married in\nRotterdam a month ago.",
    "Unfortunately he had to return to Canada.",
    "I\nwas detained but I am now about to rejoin him.",
    "Anne Richards French was fluent and easy.",
    "She was clearly more\nFrench than English.",
    "You heard of the tragedy  how\n\n\fNaturally I read of it in me papers.",
    "But I did not know  that is I did\nnot realize  that the victim in the case was my mother.",
    "Then I received\na telegram here in Paris from M\u00e8re Ang\u00e9lique giving me the address of\nMa\u043etre Thibault and reminding me of my mothers maiden name.",
    "Fournier nodded thoughtfully.",
    "They talked a little further but it seemed clear that Mrs Richards could\nbe of little assistance to them in their search for the murderer.",
    "She\nknew nothing at all of her mothers life or business relations.",
    "Having elicited the name of the hotel at which she was staying Poirot\nand Fournier took leave of her.",
    "You are disappointed mon vieux said Fournier.",
    "You have some\nidea in your brain about this girl Did you suspect that she might be an\nimpostor Or do you in fact still suspect that she is an impostor\n\nPoirot shook his head in a discouraged manner.",
    "No I do not think she is an impostor.",
    "Her proofs of identity sound\ngenuine enough.",
    "It is odd though I feel that I have either seen her\nbefore or that she reminds me of someone.",
    "A likeness to the dead woman suggested Fournier doubtfully.",
    "Surely not.",
    "No it is not that.",
    "I wish I could remember what it was.",
    "I am sure her\nface reminds me of someone.",
    "Fournier looked at him curiously.",
    "You have always I think been intrigued by the missing daughter.",
    "Naturally said Poirot his eyebrows rising a little.",
    "Of all the people\nwho may or may not benefit by Giselles death this young woman does\nbenefit very definitely in hard cash.",
    "True but does that get us anywhere\n\nPoirot did not answer for a minute or two.",
    "He was following the train of\nhis own thoughts.",
    "He said at last\n\nMy friend a very large fortune passes to this girl.",
    "Do you wonder that\nfrom the beginning I speculated as to her being implicated There\nwere three women on that plane.",
    "One of them.",
    "Miss Venetia Kerr was\nof wellknown and authenticated family.",
    "But the other two Ever since\n\u00c9lise Grandier advanced the theory that the father of Madame Giselles\nchild was an Englishman I have kept it in my mind that one of the two\nother women might conceivably be this daughter.",
    "They were both of\napproximately the right age.",
    "Lady Horbury was a chorus girl whose\nantecedents were somewhat obscure and who acted under a stage\nname.",
    "Miss Jane Grey as she once told me had been brought up in an\norphanage.",
    "Ahha said the Frenchman.",
    "So that is the way your mind has been\nrunning\n\nOur\n\noveringenious.",
    "friend\n\nJapp\n\nwould\n\nsay\n\nthat\n\nyou\n\nwere\n\nbeing\n\n\fIt is true that he always accuses me of preferring to make things\ndifficult.",
    "You see\n\nBut as a matter of fact it is not true.",
    "I proceed always in the simplest\nmanner imaginable And I never refuse to accept facts.",
    "But you are disappointed You expected more from this Anne\nMorisot\n\nThey were just entering Poirots hotel.",
    "An object lying on me reception\ndesk recalled Fourniers mind to something Poirot had said earlier in\nthe morning.",
    "I have not thanked you he said for drawing my attention to the\nerror I had committed.",
    "I noted the two cigarette holders of Lady\nHorbury and the Kurdish pipes of the Duponts.",
    "I was unpardonable on\nmy part to have forgotten the flute of Doctor Bryant.",
    "Though I do not\nseriously suspect him.",
    "You do not\n\nNo.",
    "He does not strike me as the kind of man to \n\nHe stopped.",
    "The man standing at the reception desk talking to the\nclerk turned his hand on the flute case.",
    "His glance fell on Poirot and\nhis face lit up in grave recognition.",
    "Poirot went forward Fournier\ndiscreetly withdrew into the background.",
    "As well that Bryant should\nnot see him.",
    "Doctor Bryant said Poirot bowing.",
    "M. Poirot.",
    "They shook hands.",
    "A woman who had been standing near Bryant\nmoved away toward the lift.",
    "Poirot sent just a fleeting glance after her.",
    "He said Well M. le docteur are your patients managing to do without\nyou for a little\n\nDoctor Bryant smiled  that melancholy attractive smile that the other\nremembered so well.",
    "He looked tired but strangely peaceful.",
    "I have no patients now he said.",
    "Then moving toward a little table he said\n\nA glass of sherry M. Poirot Or some other aperitif\n\nI thank you.",
    "They sat down and the doctor gave the order.",
    "Then he said slowly\n\nNo I have no patients now.",
    "I have retired.",
    "A sudden decision\n\nNot so very sudden.",
    "He was silent as the drinks were set before them.",
    "Then raising his\nglass he said\n\nIt is a necessary decision.",
    "I resign of my own free will before I am\nstruck off the register.",
    "He went on speaking in a gentle faraway\nvoice There comes to everyone a turning point in their lives M.\nPoirot.",
    "They stand at the crossroads and have to decide.",
    "My\nprofession interests me enormously it is a sorrow  a very great\nsorrow  to abandon it.",
    "But there are other claims.",
    "There is M. Poirot\nthe happiness of a human being.",
    "Poirot did not speak.",
    "He waited.",
    "There is a lady  a patient of mine  I love her very dearly.",
    "She has a\nhusband who causes her infinite misery.",
    "He takes drugs.",
    "If you were a\ndoctor you would know what that meant.",
    "She has no money of her\nown so she cannot leave him.",
    "For some time I have been undecided but now I have made up my\nmind.",
    "She and I are now on our way to Kenya to begin a new life.",
    "I hope\nthat at last she may know a little happiness.",
    "She has suffered so long.",
    "Again he was silent.",
    "Then he said in a brisker tone\n\nI tell you this M. Poirot because it will soon be public property and\nthe sooner you know the better.",
    "I understand said Poirot.",
    "After a minute he said You take your\nflute I see.",
    "Doctor Bryant smiled.",
    "My flute M. Poirot is my oldest companion.",
    "When everything else\nfails music remains.",
    "His hand ran lovingly over the flute case then with a bow he rose.",
    "Poirot rose also.",
    "My best wishes for your future M. le docteur and for that of\nmadame said Poirot.",
    "When Fournier rejoined his friend Poirot was at the desk making\narrangements for a trunk call to Quebec.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nWhat now cried Fournier.",
    "You are still preoccupied with this girl\nwho inherits Decidedly it is the id\u00e9e fixe you have there.",
    "Not at all  not at all said Poirot.",
    "But there must be in all things\norder and method.",
    "One must finish with one thing before proceeding to\nthe next.",
    "He looked round.",
    "Here is Mademoiselle Jane.",
    "Suppose that you commence dejeuner.",
    "I\nwill join you as soon as I can.",
    "Fournier acquiesced and he and Jane went into the dining room.",
    "Well said Jane with curiosity.",
    "What is she like\n\nShe is a little over medium height dark with a matte complexion a\npointed chin \n\nYoure talking exactly like a passport said Jane.",
    "My passport\ndescription is simply insulting I think.",
    "Its composed of mediums and\nordinary.",
    "Nose medium mouth ordinary.",
    "How do they expect you to\ndescribe a mouth Forehead ordinary chin ordinary.",
    "But not ordinary eyes said Fournier.",
    "Even they are gray which is not a very exciting color.",
    "And who has told you mademoiselle that it is not an exciting color\nsaid the Frenchman leaning across the table.",
    "Jane laughed.",
    "Your command of the English language she said is\nhighly efficient.",
    "Tell me more about Anne Morisot.",
    "Is she pretty\n\nAssez bien said Fournier cautiously.",
    "And she is not Anne Morisot.",
    "She is Anne Richards.",
    "She is married.",
    "Was the husband there too\n\n\fNo.",
    "Why not I wonder\n\nBecause he is in Canada or America.",
    "He explained some of the circumstances of Annes life.",
    "Just as he was\ndrawing his narrative to a close Poirot joined them.",
    "He looked a little dejected.",
    "Well mon cher inquired Fournier.",
    "I spoke to the principal  to M\u043are Ang\u00e9lique herself.",
    "It is romantic you\nknow the transatlantic telephone.",
    "To speak so easily to someone\nnearly halfway across the globe.",
    "The telegraphed photograph  that too is romantic.",
    "Science is the\ngreatest romance there is.",
    "But you were saying\n\nI talked with M\u043are Ang\u00e9lique.",
    "She confirmed exactly what Mrs\nRichards told us of the circumstances of her having been brought up\nat the Institut de Marie.",
    "She spoke quite frankly about the mother who\nleft Quebec with a Frenchman interested in the wine trade.",
    "She was\nrelieved at the time that the child would not come under her mothers\ninfluence.",
    "From her point of view Giselle was on the downward path.",
    "Money was sent regularly but Giselle never suggested a meeting.",
    "In fact your conversation was a repetition of what we heard this\nmorning.",
    "Practically except that it was more detailed.",
    "Anne Morisot left the\nInstitut de Marie six years ago to become a manicurist afterwards she\nhad a job as a ladys maid and finally left Quebec for Europe in that\ncapacity.",
    "Her letters were not frequent but M\u043are Ang\u00e9lique usually\nheard from her about twice a year.",
    "When she saw an account of the\ninquest in the paper she realized that this Marie Morisot was in all\nprobability the Marie Morisot who had lived in Quebec.",
    "What about the husband asked Fournier.",
    "Now that we know\ndefinitely that Giselle was married the husband might become a\nfactor\n\nI thought of that.",
    "It was one of the reasons for my telephone call.",
    "George Leman Giselles blackguard of a husband was killed in the\nearly days of the war.",
    "He paused and then remarked abruptly\n\nWhat was it that I just said  not my last remark the one before I have\nan idea that without knowing it I said something of significance.",
    "Fournier repeated as well as he could the substance of Poirots\nremarks but the little man shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.",
    "No no it was not that.",
    "Well no matter.",
    "He turned to Jane and engaged her in conversation.",
    "At the close of the meal he suggested that they should have coffee in\nthe lounge.",
    "Jane agreed and stretched out her hand for her bag and gloves which\nwere on the table.",
    "As she picked them up she winced slightly.",
    "What is it mademoiselle\n\nOh its nothing laughed Jane.",
    "Its only a jagged nail.",
    "I must file it.",
    "Poirot sat down again very suddenly.",
    "Nom dun nom dun nom he said quietly.",
    "The other two stared at him in surprise.",
    "M. Poirot cried Jane.",
    "What is it\n\nIt is said Poirot that I remember now why the face of Anne Morisot\nis familiar to me.",
    "I have seen her before.",
    "In the aeroplane on the day of\nthe murder.",
    "Lady Horbury sent for her to get a nail file.",
    "Anne Morisot\nwas Lady Horburys maid.",
    "Chapter 25\n\n\fThis sudden revelation had an almost stunning effect on the three\npeople sitting round the luncheon table.",
    "It opened up an entirely new\naspect of the case.",
    "Instead of being a person wholly remote from the tragedy Anne\nMorisot was now shown to have been actually present on the scene of\nthe crime.",
    "It took a minute or two for everyone to readjust his ideas.",
    "Poirot made a frantic gesture with his hand his eyes were closed his\nface contorted in agony.",
    "A little minute  a little minute he implored them.",
    "I have got to think\nto see to realize how this affects my ideas of the case.",
    "I must go back\nin mind.",
    "I must remember.",
    "A thousand maledictions on my unfortunate\nstomach.",
    "I was preoccupied only with my internal sensations\n\nShe was actually on the plane then said Fournier.",
    "I see.",
    "I begin to\nsee.",
    "I remember said Jane.",
    "A tall dark girl.",
    "Her eyes half closed in an\neffort of memory.",
    "Madeleine Lady Horbury called her.",
    "That is it  Madeleine said Poirot.",
    "Lady Horbury sent her along to the end of the plane to fetch a case  a\nscarlet dressing case.",
    "You mean said Fournier that this girl went right past the seat\nwhere her mother was sitting\n\n\fThat is right.",
    "The motive said Fournier.",
    "He gave a great sigh.",
    "And the\nopportunity.",
    "Yes it is all there.",
    "Then with a sudden vehemence most unlike his usual melancholy\nmanner he brought down his hand with a bang on the table.",
    "But parbleu he cried.",
    "Why did no one mention this before Why\nwas she not included amongst the suspected persons\n\nI have told you my friend  I have told you said Poirot wearily.",
    "My\nunfortunate stomach.",
    "Yes yes that is understandable.",
    "But there were other stomachs\nunaffected.",
    "The stewards the other passengers.",
    "I think said Jane that perhaps it was because it was so very early\nthis happened.",
    "The plane had only just left Le Bourget.",
    "And Giselle\nwas alive and well an hour or so after that.",
    "It seemed as though she\nmust have been killed much later.",
    "That is curious said Fournier thoughtfully.",
    "Can there have been a\ndelayed action of the poison Such things happen.",
    "Poirot groaned and dropped his head into his hands.",
    "I must think.",
    "I must think.",
    "Can it be possible that all along my ideas\nhave been entirely wrong\n\n\fMon vieux said Fournier such things happen.",
    "They happen to me it\nis possible that they have happened to you.",
    "One has occasionally to\npocket ones pride and readjust ones ideas.",
    "That is true agreed Poirot.",
    "It is possible that all along I have\nattached too much importance to one particular thing.",
    "I expected to\nfind a certain clue.",
    "I found it and I built up my case from it.",
    "But if I have\nbeen wrong from the beginning  if that particular article was where it\nwas merely as the result of an accident  why then  yes I will admit\nthat I have been wrong  completely wrong.",
    "You cannot shut your eyes to the importance of this turn of events\nsaid Fournier.",
    "Motive and opportunity  what more can you want\n\nNothing.",
    "It must be as you say.",
    "The delayed action of the poison is\nindeed extraordinary  practically speaking one would say impossible.",
    "But where poisons are concerned the impossible does happen.",
    "One\nhas to reckon with idiosyncrasy.",
    "His voice tailed off.",
    "We must discuss a plan of campaign said Fournier.",
    "For the\nmoment it would I think be unwise to arouse Anne Morisots\nsuspicions.",
    "She is completely unaware that you have recognized her.",
    "Her bona fides has been accepted.",
    "We know the hotel at which she is\nstaying and we can keep in touch with her through Thibault.",
    "Legal\nformalities can always be delayed.",
    "We have two points established opportunity and motive.",
    "We have still to prove that Anne Morisot had\nsnake venom in her possession.",
    "There is also the question of the\nAmerican who bought the blowpipe and bribed Jules Perrot.",
    "It might\n\n\fcertainly be the husband Richards.",
    "We have only her word for it that\nhe is in Canada.",
    "As you say the husband  yes the husband.",
    "Ah wait  wait.",
    "Poirot pressed his hands upon his temples.",
    "It is all wrong he murmured.",
    "I do not employ the little gray cells of\nthe brain in an orderly and methodical way.",
    "No I leap to conclusions.",
    "I\nthink perhaps what I am meant to think.",
    "No that is wrong again.",
    "If my\noriginal idea were right I could not be meant to think \n\nHe broke off.",
    "I beg your pardon said Jane.",
    "Poirot did not answer for a moment or two.",
    "Then he took his hands\nfrom his temples sat very upright and straightened two forks and a\nsaltcellar which offended his sense of symmetry.",
    "Let us reason he said.",
    "Anne Morisot is either guilty or innocent of\nthe crime.",
    "If she is innocent why has she lied Why has she concealed\nthe fact that she was ladys maid to Lady Horbury\n\nWhy indeed said Fournier.",
    "So we say Anne Morisot is guilty because she has lied.",
    "But wait.",
    "Suppose my first supposition was correct.",
    "Will that supposition fit in\nwith Anne Morisots guilt or with Anne Morisots lie Yes yes it might \n\n\fgiven one premise.",
    "But in that case and if that premise is correct then\nAnne Morisot should have not been on the plane at all.",
    "The others looked at him politely if with perhaps a rather perfunctory\ninterest.",
    "Fournier thought\n\nI see now what the Englishman Japp meant.",
    "He makes difficulties\nthis old one.",
    "He tries to make an affair which is now simple sound\ncomplicated.",
    "He cannot accept a straightforward solution without\npretending that it squares with his preconceived ideas.",
    "Jane thought\n\nI dont see in the least what he means.",
    "Why couldnt the girl be in the\nplane She had to go wherever Lady Horbury wanted her to go.",
    "I think\nhes rather a mountebank really.",
    "Suddenly Poirot drew in his breath with a hiss.",
    "Of course he said.",
    "It is a possibility And it ought to be very simple\nto find out.",
    "He rose.",
    "What now my friend asked Fournier.",
    "Again the telephone said Poirot.",
    "The transatlantic to Quebec\n\nThis time it is merely to call to London.",
    "To Scotland Yard\n\nNo to Lord Horburys house in Grosvenor Square.",
    "If only I have the\ngood fortune to find Lady Horbury at home.",
    "Be careful my friend if any suspicion gets round to Anne Morisot that\nwe have been making inquiries about her it would not suit our affair.",
    "Above all we must not put her upon her guard.",
    "Have no fears.",
    "I will be discreet.",
    "I ask only one little question.",
    "A\nquestion of a most harmless nature.",
    "He smiled.",
    "You shall come with\nme if you like.",
    "No no.",
    "But yes.",
    "I insist.",
    "The two men went off leaving Jane in the lounge.",
    "It took some little time to put the call through.",
    "But Poirots luck was in.",
    "Lady Horbury was lunching at home.",
    "Good.",
    "Will you tell Lady Horbury that it is Mr Hercule Poirot speaking\nfrom Paris.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "That is you Lady Horbury... No no\nall is well.",
    "I assure you all is well.",
    "It is not that matter at all.",
    "I want you\nto answer me a question...",
    "Yes...",
    "When you go from Paris to England\n\n\fby air does your maid usually go with you or does she go by train...\nBy train.",
    "And so on that particular occasion...",
    "I see... You are sure...\nAh she has left you...",
    "I see.",
    "She left you very suddenly at a moments\nnotice... Mais oui base ingratitude.",
    "It is too true.",
    "A most ungrateful\nclass...",
    "Yes yes exactly... No no you need not worry.",
    "Au revoir.",
    "Thank you.",
    "He replaced the receiver and turned to Fournier his eyes green and\nshining.",
    "Listen my friend Lady Horburys maid usually traveled by train and\nboat.",
    "On the occasion of Giselles murder Lady Horbury decided at\nthe last moment that Madeleine had better go by air too.",
    "He took the Frenchman by the arm.",
    "Quick my friend he said.",
    "We must go to her hotel.",
    "If my little idea is\ncorrect  and I think it is  there is no time to be lost.",
    "Fournier stared at him.",
    "But before he could frame a question Poirot\nhad turned away and was heading for the revolving doors leading out\nof the hotel.",
    "Fournier hastened after him.",
    "But I do not understand What is all this\n\nThe commissionaire was holding open the door of a taxi.",
    "Poirot jumped\nin and gave the address of Anne Morisots hotel.",
    "And drive quickly but quickly\n\nFournier jumped in after him.",
    "What fly is this that has bitten you Why this mad rush this haste\n\nBecause my friend if as I say my little idea is correct Anne Morisot\nis in imminent danger.",
    "You think so\n\nFournier could not help a skeptical tone creeping into his voice.",
    "I am afraid said Poirot.",
    "Afraid.",
    "Bon Dieu how this taxi crawls\n\nThe taxi at the moment was doing a good forty miles an hour and\ncutting in and out of traffic with a miraculous immunity due to the\nexcellent eye of the driver.",
    "It crawls to such an extent that we shall have an accident in a\nminute said Fournier dryly.",
    "And Mademoiselle Grey we have left her\nplanted there awaiting our return from the telephone and instead we\nleave the hotel without a word.",
    "It is not very polite that\n\nPoliteness or impoliteness what does it matter in an affair of life and\ndeath\n\nLife or death Fournier shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He thought to himself\n\n\fIt is all very well but this obstinate madman may endanger the whole\nbusiness.",
    "Once the girl knows that we are on her track \n\nHe said in a persuasive voice\n\nSee now M. Poirot be reasonable.",
    "We must go carefully.",
    "You do not understand said Poirot.",
    "I am afraid  afraid.",
    "The taxi drew up with a jerk at the quiet hotel where Anne Morisot was\nstaying.",
    "Poirot sprang out and nearly collided with a young man just leaving the\nhotel.",
    "Poirot stopped dead for a moment looking after him.",
    "Another face that I know.",
    "But where... Ah I remember.",
    "It is the\nactor Raymond Barraclough.",
    "As he stepped forward to enter the hotel Fournier placed a restraining\nhand on his arm.",
    "M. Poirot I have the utmost respect the utmost admiration for your\nmethods but I feel very strongly that no precipitate action must be\ntaken.",
    "I am responsible here in France for the conduct of this case.",
    "Poirot interrupted him\n\n\fI comprehend your anxiety.",
    "But do not fear any precipitate action on\nmy part.",
    "Let us make inquiries at the desk.",
    "If Madame Richards is here\nand all is well then no harm is done and we can discuss together our\nfuture action.",
    "You do not object to that\n\nNo no of course not.",
    "Good.",
    "Poirot passed through the revolving door and went up to the reception\ndesk.",
    "Fournier followed him.",
    "You have a Mrs Richards staying here I believe said Poirot.",
    "No monsieur.",
    "She was staying here but she left today.",
    "She has left demanded Fournier.",
    "Yes monsieur.",
    "When did she leave\n\nThe clerk glanced up at the clock.",
    "A little over half an hour ago.",
    "Was her departure unexpected Where has she gone\n\n\fThe clerk stiffened at the questions and was disposed to refuse to\nanswer.",
    "But when Fourniers credentials were produced the clerk\nchanged his tone and was eager to give any assistance in his power.",
    "No the lady had not left an address.",
    "He thought her departure was the\nresult of a sudden change of plans.",
    "She had formerly said she was\nmaking a stay of about a week.",
    "More questions.",
    "The concierge was\nsummoned the luggage porters the lift boys.",
    "According to the concierge a gentleman had called to see the lady.",
    "He\nhad come while she was out but had awaited her return and they had\nlunched together.",
    "What kind of gentleman An American gentleman.",
    "Very American.",
    "She had seemed surprised to see him.",
    "After lunch the\nlady gave orders for her luggage to be brought down and put on a taxi.",
    "Where had she driven to She had driven to the Gare du Nord  at least\nthat was the order she had given to the taximan.",
    "Did the American\ngentleman go with her No she had gone alone.",
    "The Gare du Nord said Fournier.",
    "That means England on the face\nof it.",
    "The twooclock service.",
    "But it may be a blind.",
    "We must telephone\nto Boulogne and also try and get hold of that taxi.",
    "It was as though Poirots fears had communicated themselves to\nFournier.",
    "The Frenchmans face was anxious.",
    "Rapidly and efficiently he set the machinery of the law in motion.",
    "It was five oclock when Jane sitting in the lounge of the hotel with a\nbook looked up to see Poirot coming toward her.",
    "She opened her mouth reproachfully but the words regained\nunspoken.",
    "Something in his face stopped her.",
    "What is it she said.",
    "Has anything happened\n\nPoirot took both her hands in his.",
    "Life is very terrible mademoiselle he said.",
    "Something in his tone made Jane feel frightened.",
    "What is it she said again.",
    "Poirot said slowly\n\nWhen the boat train reached Boulogne they found a woman in a firstclass carriage dead.",
    "The color ebbed from Janes face.",
    "Anne Morisot\n\nAnne Morisot.",
    "In her hand was a little blue glass bottle which had\ncontained prussic acid.",
    "Oh said Jane.",
    "Suicide\n\nPoirot did not answer for a moment or two.",
    "Then he said with the air of\none who chooses his words carefully\n\nYes the police think it was suicide.",
    "And you\n\nPoirot slowly spread out his hands in an expressive gesture.",
    "What else is there to think\n\nShe killed herself Why Because of remorse or because she was\nafraid of being found out\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "Life can be very terrible he said.",
    "One needs much courage.",
    "To kill oneself Yes I suppose one does.",
    "Also to live said Poirot one needs courage.",
    "Chapter 26\n\n\fThe next day Poirot left Paris.",
    "Jane stayed behind with a list of duties\nto perform.",
    "Most of these seemed singularly meaningless to her but\nshe carried them out to the best of her powers.",
    "She saw Jean Dupont\ntwice.",
    "He mentioned the expedition which she was to join and Jane\ndid not dare to undeceive him without orders from Poirot so she\nhedged as best she could and turned the conversation to other\nmatters.",
    "Five days later she was recalled to England by a telegram.",
    "Norman met her at Victoria and they discussed recent events.",
    "Very little publicity had been given to the suicide.",
    "There had been a\nparagraph in the papers stating that a Canadian lady a Mrs Richards\nhad committed suicide in the ParisBoulogne express but that was all.",
    "There had been no mention of any connection with the aeroplane\nmurder.",
    "Both Norman and Jane were inclined to be jubilant.",
    "Their troubles\nthey hoped were at an end.",
    "Norman was not so sanguine as Jane.",
    "They may suspect her of doing her mother in but now that shes\ntaken this way out they probably wont bother to go on with the case.",
    "And unless it is proved publicly I dont see what good it is going to be\nto all of us poor devils.",
    "From the point of view of the public we shall\nremain under suspicion just as much as ever.",
    "He said as much to Poirot whom he met a few days later in Piccadilly.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "You are like all the rest.",
    "You think I am an old man who accomplishes\nnothing Listen you shall come tonight to dine with me.",
    "Japp is\ncoming and also our friend Mr Clancy.",
    "I have some things to say that\nmay be interesting.",
    "The dinner passed off pleasantly.",
    "Japp was patronizing and goodhumored Norman was interested and little Mr Clancy was nearly as\nthrilled as when he had recognized the fatal thorn.",
    "It seemed clear that Poirot was not above trying to impress the little\nauthor.",
    "After dinner when coffee had been drunk Poirot cleared his throat in\na slightly embarassed manner not free from selfimportance.",
    "My friends he said Mr Clancy here has expressed interest in what\nhe would call my methods Watson Cest \u0437a nestce pas I propose\nif it will not bore you all \n\nHe paused significantly and Norman and Japp said quickly No no\nand Most interesting.",
    "to give you a little r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of my methods in dealing with this case.",
    "He paused and consulted some notes.",
    "Japp whispered to Norman\n\nFancies himself doesnt he Conceits that little mans middle name.",
    "Poirot looked at him reproachfully and said.",
    "Ahem\n\n\fThree politely interested faces were turned to him and he began\n\nI will start at the beginning my friends.",
    "I will go back to the air liner\nPrometheus on its illfated journey from Paris to Croydon.",
    "I am going\nto tell you my precise ideas and impressions at the time passing on to\nhow I came to confirm or modify them in the light of future events.",
    "When just before we reached Croydon Doctor Bryant was\napproached by the steward and went with him to examine the body I\naccompanied him.",
    "I had a feeling that it might  who knows  be\nsomething in my line.",
    "I have perhaps too professional a point of view\nwhere deaths are concerned.",
    "They are divided in my mind into two\nclasses  deaths which are my affair and deaths which are not my affair\n and though the latter class is infinitely more numerous nevertheless\nwhenever I come in contact with death I am like the dog who lifts his\nhead and sniffs the scent.",
    "Doctor Bryant confirmed the stewards fear that the woman was\ndead.",
    "As to the cause of death naturally he could not pronounce on\nthat without a detailed examination.",
    "It was at this point that a\nsuggestion was made  by Mr Jean Dupont  that death was due to\nshock following on a wasp sting.",
    "In furtherance of this hypothesis he\ndrew attention to a wasp that he himself had slaughtered shortly\nbefore.",
    "Now that was a perfectly plausible theory and one quite likely to be\naccepted.",
    "There was the mark on the dead womans neck closely\nresembling the mark of a sting and there was the fact that a wasp had\nbeen in the plane.",
    "But at that moment I was fortunate enough to look down and espy\nwhat might at first have been taken for the body of yet another wasp.",
    "In actuality it was a native thorn with a little teased yellowandblack\nsilk on it.",
    "At this point Mr Clancy came forward and made the statement that it\nwas a thorn shot from a blowpipe after the manner of some native\ntribe.",
    "Later as you all know the blowpipe itself was discovered.",
    "By the time we reached Croydon several ideas were working in my\nmind.",
    "Once I was definitely on the firm ground my brain began to work\nonce more with its normal brilliance.",
    "Go it M. Poirot said Japp with a grin.",
    "Dont have any false\nmodesty.",
    "Poirot threw him a look and went on\n\nOne idea presented itself very strongly to me  as it did to everyone\nelse  and that was the audacity of a crime being committed in such a\nmanner and the astonishing fact that nobody noticed its being done\n\nThere were two other points that interested me.",
    "One was the\nconvenient presence of the wasp.",
    "The other was the discovery of the\nblowpipe.",
    "As I remarked after the inquest to my friend Japp why on\nearth did the murderer not get rid of it by passing it out through the\nventilating hole in the window The thorn itself might be difficult to\ntrace or identify but a blowpipe which still retained a portion of its\nprice label was a very different matter.",
    "What was the solution Obviously that the murderer wanted the\nblowpipe to be found.",
    "But why Only one answer seemed logical.",
    "If a poisoned dart and a\nblowpipe were found it would naturally be assumed that the murder\nhad been committed by a thorn shot from a blowpipe.",
    "Therefore in\nreality the murder had not been committed that way.",
    "On the other hand as medical evidence was to show the cause of\ndeath was undoubtedly the poisoned thorn.",
    "I shut my eyes and asked\nmyself What is the surest and most reliable way of placing a poisoned\nthorn in the jugular vein And the answer came immediately By\nhand.",
    "And that immediately threw light on the necessity for the finding of\nthe blowpipe.",
    "The blowpipe inevitably conveyed the suggestion of\ndistance.",
    "If my theory was right the person who killed Madame Giselle\nwas a person who went right up to her table and bent over her.",
    "Was there such a person Yes there were two people.",
    "The two\nstewards.",
    "Either of them could go up to Madame Giselle lean toward\nher and nobody would notice anything unusual.",
    "Was there anyone else\n\nWell there was Mr Clancy.",
    "He was the only person in the car who had\npassed immediately by Madame Giselles seat  and I remember that it\nwas he who had first drawn attention to the blowpipeandthorn\ntheory.",
    "Mr Clancy sprang to his feet.",
    "I protest he cried.",
    "I protest This is an outrage\n\nSit down said Poirot.",
    "I have not finished yet.",
    "I have to show you all\nthe steps by which I arrived at my conclusion.",
    "I had now three persons as possible suspects.",
    "Mitchell Davis and Mr\nClancy.",
    "None of them at first sight appeared like murderers but there\nwas much investigation to be done.",
    "I next turned my mind to the possibilities of the wasp.",
    "It was\nsuggestive that wasp.",
    "To begin with no one had noticed it until about\nthe time coffee was served.",
    "That in itself was rather curious.",
    "I\nconstructed a certain theory of the crime.",
    "The murderer presented to\nthe world two separate solutions of the tragedy.",
    "On the first or\nsimplest Madame Giselle was stung by a wasp and had succumbed to\nheart failure.",
    "The success of that solution depended on whether or not\nthe murderer was in a position to retrieve the thorn.",
    "Japp and I agreed\nthat that could be done easily enough  so long as no suspicion of foul\nplay had arisen.",
    "There was the particular coloring of the silk which I\nhad no doubt was deliberately substituted for the original cerise so as\nto simulate the appearance of a wasp.",
    "Our murderer then approaches the victims table inserts the thorn\nand releases the wasp The poison is so powerful that death would\noccurr almost immediately.",
    "If Giselle cried out it would probably not\nbe heard owing to the noise of the plane.",
    "If it was just noticed well\n\n\fthere was a wasp buzzing about to explain the cry.",
    "The poor woman\nhad been stung.",
    "That as I say was Plan No.",
    "1.",
    "But supposing that as actually\nhappened the poisoned thorn was discovered before the murderer\ncould retrieve it.",
    "In that case the fat is in the fire.",
    "The theory of natural\ndeath is impossible.",
    "Instead of getting rid of the blowpipe through the\nwindow it is put in a place where it is bound to be discovered when the\nplane is searched.",
    "And at once it will be assumed that the blowpipe\nwas the instrument of the crime.",
    "The proper atmosphere of distance\nwill be created and when the blowpipe is traced it will focus suspicion\nin a definite and prearranged direction.",
    "I had now my theory of the crime and I had three suspects with a\nbarely possible fourth  M. Jean Dupont who had outlined the Deathbyawaspsting theory and who was sitting on the gangway so near\nGiselle that he might just possibly have moved from his seat without\nbeing noticed.",
    "On the other hand I did not really think he would have\ndared to take such a risk.",
    "I concentrated on the problem of the wasp.",
    "If the murderer had\nbrought the wasp onto the plane and released it at the psychological\nmoment he must have had something in the nature of a small box in\nwhich to keep it.",
    "Hence my interest in the contents of the passengers pockets and\nhand luggage.",
    "And here I came up against a totally unexpected development.",
    "I found\nwhat I was looking for  but as it seemed to me on the wrong person.",
    "There was an empty smallsized Bryant  Mays match box in Mr\nNorman Gales pocket.",
    "But by everybodys evidence Mr Gale had\nnever passed down the gangway of the car.",
    "He had only visited the\nwashroom compartment and returned to his own seat.",
    "Nevertheless although it seems impossible there was a method by\nwhich Mr Gale could have committed the crime  as the contents of his\nattach\u00e9 case showed.",
    "My attach\u00e9 case said Norman Gale.",
    "He looked amused and puzzled.",
    "Why I dont even remember now what was in it.",
    "Poirot smiled at him amiably.",
    "Wait a little minute.",
    "I will come to that.",
    "I am telling you my first ideas.",
    "To proceed I had four persons who could have done the crime  from\nthe point of view of possibility.",
    "The two stewards Clancy and Gale.",
    "I now looked at the case from the opposite angle  that of motive if a\nmotive were to coincide with a possibility  well I had my murderer\nBut alas I could find nothing of the kind.",
    "My friend Japp has accused\nme of liking to make things difficult.",
    "On the contrary I approached this\nquestion of motive with all the simplicity in the world.",
    "To whose benefit\nwould it be if Madame Giselle were removed Clearly to her unknown\ndaughters benefit since that unknown daughter would inherit a\nfortune.",
    "There were also certain persons who were in Madame\nGiselles power  or shall we say who might be in Giselles power for\naught we knew That then was a task of elimination.",
    "Of the\n\n\fpassengers in the plane I could only be certain of one who was\nundoubtedly mixed up with Giselle.",
    "That one was Lady Horbury.",
    "In Lady Horburys case the motive was clear.",
    "She had visited Giselle\nat her house in Paris the night before.",
    "She was desperate and she had\na friend a young actor who might easily have impersonated the\nAmerican who bought the blowpipe and might also have bribed the\nclerk in Universal Air Lines to insure that Giselle traveled by the twelve\noclock service.",
    "I had as it were a problem in two halves.",
    "I did not see how it was\npossible for Lady Horbury to commit the crime.",
    "And I could not see for\nwhat motive the stewards Mr Clancy or Mr Gale should want to\ncommit it.",
    "Always in the back of my mind I considered the problem of Giselles\nunknown daughter and heiress.",
    "Were any of my four suspects married\nand if so could one of the wives be this Anne Morisot If her father was\nEnglish the girl might have been brought up in England.",
    "Mitchells wife\nI soon dismissed  she was of good old Dorset country stock.",
    "Davis\nwas courting a girl whose father and mother were alive.",
    "Mr Clancy was\nnot married.",
    "Mr Gale was obviously head over ears in love with Miss\nJane Grey.",
    "I may say that I investigated the antecedents of Miss Grey very\ncarefully having learned from her in casual conversation that she had\nbeen brought up in an orphanage near Dublin.",
    "But I soon satisfied\nmyself that Miss Grey was not Madame Giselles daughter.",
    "I made out a table of results.",
    "The stewards had neither gained nor lost\nby Madame Giselles death except that Mitchell was obviously\nsuffering from shock.",
    "Mr Clancy was planning a book on the subject by\nwhich he hoped to make money Mr Gale was fast losing his practice.",
    "Nothing very helpful there.",
    "And yet at that time I was convinced that Mr Gale was the murderer there was the empty match box the contents of his attach\u00e9 case.",
    "Apparently he lost not gained by the death of Giselle.",
    "But those\nappearances might be false appearances.",
    "I determined to cultivate his acquaintance.",
    "It is my experience that no\none in the course of conversation can fail to give themselves away\nsooner or later.",
    "Everyone has an irresistible urge to talk about\nthemselves.",
    "I tried to gain Mr Gales confidence.",
    "I pretended to confide in him and\nI even enlisted his help.",
    "I persuaded him to aid me in the fake\nblackmailing of Lady Horbury.",
    "And it was then that he made his first\nmistake.",
    "I had suggested a slight disguise.",
    "He arrived to play his part with a\nridiculous and impossible outfit The whole thing was a farce.",
    "No one I\nfelt sure could play a part as badly as he was proposing to play one.",
    "What then was the reason for this Because his knowledge of his own\nguilt made him chary of showing himself to be a good actor.",
    "When\nhowever I had adjusted his ridiculous makeup his artistic skill\nshowed itself.",
    "He played his part perfectly and Lady Horbury did not\nrecognize him.",
    "I was convinced then that he could have disguised\n\n\fhimself as an American in Paris and could also have played the\nnecessary part in the Prometheus.",
    "By this time I was getting seriously worried about Mademoiselle Jane.",
    "Either she was in this business with him or else she was entirely\ninnocent and in the latter case she was a victim.",
    "She might wake up\none day to find herself married to a murderer.",
    "With the object of preventing a precipitate marriage I took\nMademoiselle Jane to Paris as my secretary.",
    "It was whilst we were there that the missing heiress appeared to\nclaim her fortune.",
    "I was haunted by a resemblance that I could not\nplace.",
    "I did place it in the end but too late.",
    "At first the discovery that she had actually been in the plane and had\nlied\n\nabout\n\nit\n\nseemed\n\nto\n\noverthrow\n\nall\n\nmy\n\ntheories.",
    "Here\n\noverwhelmingly was the guilty person.",
    "But if she were guilty she had an accomplice  the man who bought\nthe blowpipe and bribed Jules Perrot.",
    "Who was that man Was it conceivably her husband\n\nAnd then suddenly I saw the true solution.",
    "True that is if one point\ncould be verified.",
    "For my solution to be correct Anne Morisot ought not to have been on\nthe plane.",
    "I rang up Lady Horbury and got my answer.",
    "The maid Madeleine\ntraveled in the plane by a lastminute whim of her mistress.",
    "He stopped.",
    "Mr Clancy said\n\nAhem  but Im afraid Im not quite clear.",
    "When did you stop pitching on me as the murderer asked Norman.",
    "Poirot wheeled round on him.",
    "I never stopped.",
    "You are the murderer...",
    "Wait.",
    "I will tell you\neverything.",
    "For the last week Japp and I have been busy.",
    "It is true that\nyou became a dentist to please your uncle John Gale.",
    "You took his\nname when you came into partnership with him but you were his\nsisters son not his brothers.",
    "Your real name is Richards.",
    "It was as\nRichards that you met the girl Anne Morisot at Nice last winter when\nshe was there with her mistress.",
    "The story she told us was true as the\nfacts of her childhood but the later part was edited carefully by you.",
    "She did know her mothers maiden name.",
    "Giselle was at Monte Carlo\nshe was pointed out and her real name was mentioned.",
    "You realized\nthat there might be a large fortune to be got.",
    "It appealed to your\ngamblers nature.",
    "It was from Anne Morisot that you learned of Lady\nHorburys connection with Giselle.",
    "The plan of the crime formed itself\nin your head.",
    "Giselle was to be murdered in such a way that suspicion\nwould fall on Lady Horbury.",
    "Your plans matured and finally fructified.",
    "You bribed the clerk in Universal Air Lines so that Giselle should travel\non the same plane as Lady Horbury.",
    "Anne Morisot had told you that\n\n\fshe herself was going to England by train you never expected her to\nbe on the plane and it seriously jeopardized your plans.",
    "If it was once\nknown that Giselles daughter and heiress had been on the plane\nsuspicion would naturally have fallen upon her.",
    "Your original idea was\nthat she should claim the inheritance with a perfect alibi since she\nwould have been on a train or a boat at the time of the crime And then\nyou would have married her.",
    "The girl was by this time infatuated with you.",
    "But it was money you\nwere after not the girl herself.",
    "There was another complication to your plans.",
    "At Le Pinet you saw\nMademoiselle Jane Grey and fell madly in love with her.",
    "Your passion\nfor her drove you on to play a much more dangerous game.",
    "You intended to have both the money and the girl you loved.",
    "You were\ncommitting a murder for the sake of money and you were in no mind to\nrelinquish the fruits of the crime.",
    "You frightened Anne Morisot by\ntelling her that if she came forward at once to proclaim her identity\nshe would certainly be suspected of the murder.",
    "Instead you induced\nher to ask for a few days leave and you went together to Rotterdam\nwhere you were married.",
    "In due course you primed her how to claim the money.",
    "She was to say\nnothing of her employment as ladys maid and it was very clearly to be\nmade plain that she and her husband had been abroad at the time of\nthe murder.",
    "Unfortunately the date planned for Anne Morisot to go to Paris and\nclaim her inheritance coincided with my arrival in Paris where Miss\n\n\fGrey had accompanied me.",
    "That did not suit your book at all.",
    "Either\nMademoiselle Jane or myself might recognize in Anne Morisot the\nMadeleine who had been Lady Horburys maid.",
    "You tried to get in touch with her in time but failed.",
    "You finally arrived\nin Paris yourself and found she had already gone to the lawyer.",
    "When\nshe returned she told you of her meeting with me.",
    "Things were\nbecoming dangerous and you made up your mind to act quickly.",
    "It had been your intention that your newmade wife should not survive\nher accession to wealth very long.",
    "Immediately after the marriage\nceremony you had both made wills leaving all you had one to the\nother A very touching business.",
    "You intended I fancy to follow a fairly leisurely course.",
    "You would\nhave gone to Canada  ostensibly because of the failure of your\npractice.",
    "There you would have resumed the name of Richards and\nyour wife would have rejoined you.",
    "All the same I do not fancy it would\nhave been very long before Mrs Richards regrettably died leaving a\nfortune to a seemingly inconsolable widower.",
    "You would then have\nreturned to England as Norman Gale having had the good fortune to\nmake a lucky speculation in Canada But now you decided that no time\nmust be lost.",
    "Poirot paused and Norman Gale threw back his head and laughed.",
    "You are very clever at knowing what people intend to do You ought to\nadopt Mr Clancys profession His tone deepened to one of anger I\nnever heard such a farrago of nonsense.",
    "What you imagined M.\nPoirot is hardly evidence\n\n\fPoirot did not seem put out.",
    "He said\n\nPerhaps not.",
    "But then I have some evidence.",
    "Really sneered Norman.",
    "Perhaps you have evidence as to how I\nkilled old Giselle when everyone in the aeroplane knows perfectly well\nI never went near her\n\nI will tell you exactly how you committed the crime said Poirot.",
    "What about the contents of your dispatch case You were on a\nholiday.",
    "Why take a dentists linen coat That is what I asked myself.",
    "And the answer is this Because it resembled so closely a stewards\ncoat.",
    "This is what you did When coffee was served and the stewards had\ngone to the other compartment you went to the wash room put on\nyour linen coat padded your cheeks with cottonwool rolls came out\nseized a coffee spoon from the box in the pantry opposite hurried\ndown the gangway with the stewards quick run spoon in hand to\nGiselles table.",
    "You thrust the thorn into her neck opened the match\nbox and let the wasp escape hurried back into the wash room\nchanged your coat and emerged leisurely to return to your table.",
    "The\nwhole thing took only a couple of minutes.",
    "Nobody notices a steward particularly.",
    "The only person who might\nhave recognized you was Mademoiselle Jane but you know women\nAs soon as a woman is left alone  particularly when she is traveling\nwith an attractive young man  she seizes the opportunity to have a\n\n\fgood look in her hand mirror powder her nose and adjust her makeup.",
    "Really sneered Gale a most interesting theory but it didnt\nhappen.",
    "Anything else\n\nQuite a lot said Poirot.",
    "As I have just said in the course of\nconversation a man gives himself away.",
    "You were imprudent enough\nto mention that for a while you were on a farm in South Africa.",
    "What\nyou did not say but what I have since found out is that it was a snake\nfarm.",
    "For the first time Norman Gale showed fear.",
    "He tried to speak but the\nwords would not come.",
    "Poirot continued\n\nYou were there under your own name of Richards a photograph of\nyou transmitted by telephone has been recognized.",
    "That same\nphotograph has been identified in Rotterdam as the man Richards who\nmarried Anne Morisot.",
    "Again Norman Gale tried to speak and failed.",
    "His whole personality\nseemed to change.",
    "The handsome vigorous young man turned into a\nratlike creature with furtive eyes looking for a way of escape and\nfinding none.",
    "It was haste ruined your plan said Poirot.",
    "The superior of the\nInstitut de Marie hurried things on by wiring to Anne Morisot.",
    "It would\nhave looked suspicious to ignore that wire.",
    "You had impressed it upon\n\n\fyour wife that unless she suppressed certain facts either she or you\nmight be suspected of murder since you had both unfortunately been\nin the plane when Giselle was killed.",
    "When you met her afterwards and\nyou learned that I had been present at the interview you hurried\nthings on.",
    "You were afraid I might get the truth out of Anne.",
    "Perhaps\nshe herself was beginning to suspect you.",
    "You hustled her away out of\nthe hotel and into the boat train.",
    "You administered prussic acid to her\nby force and you left the empty bottle in her hand.",
    "A lot of damned lies\n\nOh no.",
    "There was a bruise on her neck.",
    "Damned lies.",
    "I tell you\n\nYou even left your fingerprints on the bottle.",
    "You lie I wore \n\nAh.",
    "You wore gloves I think monsieur that little admission cooks\nyour gander.",
    "You damned interfering little mountebank Livid with passion his\nface unrecognizable Gale made a spring at Poirot.",
    "Japp however\nwas too quick for him.",
    "Holding him in a capable unemotional grip.",
    "Japp\nsaid\n\nJames Richards alias Norman Gale.",
    "I hold a warrant for your arrest\non the charge of willful murder.",
    "I must warn you that anything you say\nwill be taken down and used in evidence.",
    "A terrible shudder shook the man.",
    "He seemed on the point of collapse.",
    "A couple of plainclothes men were waiting outside.",
    "Norman Gale was\ntaken away.",
    "Left alone with Poirot little Mr Clancy drew a deep breath of ecstasy.",
    "M. Poirot he said that has been absolutely the most thrilling\nexperience of my life.",
    "You have been wonderful\n\nPoirot smiled modestly.",
    "No no.",
    "Japp deserves as much credit as I do.",
    "He has done wonders\nin identifying Gale as Richards.",
    "The Canadian police want Richards.",
    "A\ngirl he was mixed up with there is supposed to have committed\nsuicide but facts have come to light which seem to point to murder.",
    "Terrible Mr Clancy chirped.",
    "A killer said Poirot.",
    "And like many killers attractive to women.",
    "Mr Clancy coughed.",
    "That poor girl Jane Grey.",
    "Poirot shook his head sadly.",
    "Yes as I said to her life can be very terrible.",
    "But she has courage.",
    "She will come through.",
    "With an absentminded hand he arranged a pile of picture papers that\nNorman Gale had disarranged in his wild spring.",
    "Something arrested his attention  a snapshot of Venetia Kerr at a race\nmeeting talking to Lord Horbury and a friend.",
    "He handed it to Mr Clancy.",
    "You see that In a years time there will be an announcement A\nmarriage is arranged and will shortly take place between Lord\nHorbury and the Hon.",
    "Venetia Kerr.",
    "And do you know who will have\narranged that marriage Hercule Poirot There is another marriage\nthat I have arranged too.",
    "Lady Horbury and Mr Barraclough\n\nAh no in that matter I take no interest.",
    "He leaned forward.",
    "No I\nrefer to a marriage between M. Jean Dupont and Miss Jane Grey.",
    "You\nwill see.",
    "It was a month later that Jane came to Poirot.",
    "I ought to hate you M. Poirot.",
    "She looked pale and fine drawn with dark circles round her eyes.",
    "Poirot said gently\n\n\fHate me a little if you will.",
    "But I think you are one of those who would\nrather look truth in the face than live in a fools paradise.",
    "And you\nmight not have lived in it so very long.",
    "Getting rid of women is a vice\nthat grows.",
    "He was so terribly attractive said Jane.",
    "She added\n\nI shall never fall in love again.",
    "Naturally agreed Poirot.",
    "That side of life is finished for you.",
    "Jane nodded.",
    "But what I must do is to have work  something interesting that I could\nlose myself in.",
    "Poirot tilted back his chair and looked at the ceiling.",
    "I should advise you to go to Persia with the Duponts.",
    "That is\ninteresting work if you like.",
    "But  but I thought that was only camouflage on your part\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "On the contrary I have become so interested in archaeology and\nprehistoric pottery that I sent the check for the donation I had\n\n\fpromised.",
    "I heard this morning that they were expecting you to join the\nexpedition.",
    "Can you draw at all\n\nYes I was rather good at drawing at school.",
    "Excellent.",
    "I think you will enjoy your season.",
    "Do they really want me to come\n\nThey are counting on it.",
    "It would be wonderful said Jane to get right away.",
    "A little color rose in her face.",
    "M. Poirot  she looked at him suspiciously  youre not  youre not\nbeing kind\n\nKind said Poirot with a lively horror at the idea.",
    "I can assure you\nmademoiselle that where money is concerned I am strictly a man of\nbusiness.",
    "He seemed so offended that Jane quickly begged his pardon.",
    "I think she said that Id better go to some museums and look at\nsome prehistoric pottery.",
    "A very good idea.",
    "At the doorway Jane paused and then came back.",
    "You maynt have been kind in that particular way but you have been\nkind to me.",
    "She dropped a kiss on the top of his head and went out again.",
    "Ca cest tr\u00e9s gentil said Hercule Poirot."
