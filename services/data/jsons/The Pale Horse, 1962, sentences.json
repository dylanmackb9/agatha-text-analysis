    "THE PALE HORSE\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fForeword by Mark Easterbrook\n\nThere are two methods it seems to me of approaching this strange\nbusiness of the Pale Horse.",
    "In spite of the dictum of the White King\nit is difficult to achieve simplicity.",
    "One cannot that is to say Begin\nat the beginning go on to the end and then stop.",
    "For where is the\nbeginning\n\nTo a historian that always is the difficulty.",
    "At what point in history\ndoes one particular portion of history begin\n\nIn this case you can begin at the moment when Father Gorman set\nforth from his presbytery to visit a dying woman.",
    "Or you can start\nbefore that on a certain evening in Chelsea.",
    "Perhaps since I am writing the greater part of this narrative myself\nit is there that I should begin.",
    "Chapter 1\n\nThe Espresso machine behind my shoulder hissed like an angry\nsnake.",
    "The noise it made had a sinister not to say devilish\n\n\fsuggestion about it.",
    "Perhaps I reflected most of our contemporary\nnoises carry that implication.",
    "The intimidating angry scream of jet\nplanes as they flash across the sky the slow menacing rumble of a\ntube train approaching through its tunnel the heavy road transport\nthat shakes the very foundations of your house... even the minor\ndomestic noises of today beneficial in action though they may be\nyet carry a kind of alert.",
    "The dishwashers the refrigerators the\npressure cookers the whining vacuum cleaners.",
    "Be careful they\nall seem to say.",
    "I am a genie harnessed to your service but if your\ncontrol of me fails...\n\nA dangerous world  that was it a dangerous world.",
    "I stirred the foaming cup placed in front of me.",
    "It smelled pleasant.",
    "What else will you have Nice banana and bacon sandwich\n\nIt seemed an odd juxtaposition to me.",
    "Bananas I connected with my\nchildhood  or occasionally flamb\u0439 with sugar and rum.",
    "Bacon in\nmy mind was firmly associated with eggs.",
    "However when in\nChelsea eat as Chelsea does.",
    "I agreed to a nice banana and bacon\nsandwich.",
    "Although I lived in Chelsea  that is to say I had had a furnished flat\nthere for the last three months  I was in every other way a stranger\nin these parts.",
    "I was writing a book on certain aspects of Mogul\narchitecture but for that purpose I could have lived in Hampstead\nor Bloomsbury or Streatham or Chelsea and it would have been all\nthe same to me.",
    "I was oblivious of my surroundings except for the\n\n\ftools of my trade and the neighbourhood in which I lived was\ncompletely indifferent to me I existed in a world of my own.",
    "On this particular evening however I had suffered from one of\nthose sudden revulsions that all writers know.",
    "Mogul architecture Mogul emperors the Mogul way of life  and all\nthe fascinating problems it raised became suddenly as dust and\nashes.",
    "What did they matter Why did I want to write about them\n\nI flicked back various pages rereading what I had written.",
    "It all\nseemed to me uniformly bad  poorly written and singularly devoid\nof interest.",
    "Whoever had said History is bunk Henry Ford had\nbeen absolutely right.",
    "I pushed back my manuscript with loathing got up and looked at\nmy watch.",
    "The time was close on eleven p.m.",
    "I tried to remember if I\nhad had dinner.",
    "From my inner sensations I thought not.",
    "Lunch\nyes at the Athenaeum.",
    "That was a long time ago.",
    "I went and looked into the refrigerator.",
    "There was a small remnant\nof desiccated tongue.",
    "I looked at it without favor.",
    "So it was that I\nwandered out into the Kings Road and eventually turned into an\nEspresso coffee bar with the name Luigi written in red neon light\nacross its window and was now contemplating a bacon and\nbanana sandwich while I reflected on the sinister implications of\npresentday noises and their atmospheric effects.",
    "All of them I thought had something in common with my early\nmemories of pantomime.",
    "Davy Jones arriving from his locker in\n\n\fclouds of smoke Trapdoors and windows that exuded the infernal\npowers of evil challenging and defying a Good Fairy Diamond or\nsome such name who in turn waved an inadequatelooking wand\nand recited hopeful platitudes as to the ultimate triumph of good in\na flat voice thus prefacing the inevitable song of the moment\nwhich never had anything to do with the story of that particular\npantomime.",
    "It came to me suddenly that evil was perhaps necessarily always\nmore impressive than good.",
    "It had to make a show It had to startle\nand challenge It was instability attacking stability.",
    "And in the end I\nthought stability will always win.",
    "Stability can survive the triteness\nof Good Fairy Diamond the flat voice the rhymed couplet even the\nirrelevant vocal statement of Theres a winding road runs down\nthe hill To the olde world town I love.",
    "All very poor weapons it\nwould seem and yet those weapons would inevitably prevail.",
    "The\npantomime would end in the way it always ended.",
    "The staircase\nand the descending cast in order of seniority with Good Fairy\nDiamond practising the Christian virtue of humility and not seeking\nto be first or in this case last but arriving about halfway through\nthe procession side by side with her late opponent now seen to be\nno longer the snarling Demon King breathing fire and brimstone\nbut just a man dressed up in red tights.",
    "The Espresso hissed again in my ear.",
    "I signalled for another cup of\ncoffee and looked round me.",
    "A sister of mine was always accusing\nme of not being observant not noticing what was going on.",
    "You\nlive in a world of your own she would say accusingly.",
    "Now with a\nfeeling of conscious virtue I took note of what was going on.",
    "It was\nalmost impossible not to read about the coffee bars of Chelsea and\n\n\ftheir patrons every day in the newspapers this was my chance to\nmake my own appraisal of contemporary life.",
    "It was rather dark in the Espresso so you could not see very\nclearly.",
    "The clientele were almost all young people.",
    "They were I\nsupposed vaguely what was called the offbeat generation.",
    "The\ngirls looked as girls always did look to me nowadays dirty.",
    "They\nalso seemed to be much too warmly dressed.",
    "I had noticed that\nwhen I had gone out a few weeks ago to dine with some friends.",
    "The\ngirl who had sat next to me had been about twenty.",
    "The restaurant\nwas hot but she had worn a yellow wool pullover a black skirt and\nblack woollen stockings and the perspiration poured down her\nface all through the meal.",
    "She smelled of perspirationsoaked wool\nand also strongly of unwashed hair.",
    "She was said according to\nmy friends to be very attractive.",
    "Not to me My only reaction was a\nyearning to throw her into a hot bath give her a cake of soap and\nurge her to get on with it Which just showed I suppose how out of\ntouch with the times I was.",
    "Perhaps it came of having lived abroad\nso much.",
    "I recalled with pleasure Indian women with their\nbeautifully coiled black hair and their saris of pure bright colours\nhanging in graceful folds and the rhythmic sway of their bodies as\nthey walked...",
    "I was recalled from these pleasant thoughts by a sudden\naccentuation of noise.",
    "Two young women at the table next to me\nhad started a quarrel.",
    "The young men who were with them tried to\nadjust things but without avail.",
    "Suddenly they were screaming at each other.",
    "One girl slapped the\nothers face the second dragged the first from her chair.",
    "They\n\n\ffought each other like fishwives screaming abuse hysterically.",
    "One was a tousled redhead the other a lankhaired blonde.",
    "What the quarrel was about apart from terms of abuse I did not\ngather.",
    "Cries and catcalls arose from other tables.",
    "Attagirl Sock her Lou\n\nThe proprietor behind the bar a slim Italianlooking fellow with\nsideburns whom I had taken to be Luigi came to intervene in a\nvoice that was pure cockney London.",
    "Nah then  break it up  break it up  Youll ave the whole street in\nin a minute.",
    "Youll ave the coppers here.",
    "Stop it I say.",
    "But the lank blonde had the redhead by the hair and was tugging\nfuriously as she screamed\n\nYoure nothing but a manstealing bitch\n\nBitch yourself.",
    "Luigi and the two embarrassed escorts forced the girls apart.",
    "In the\nblondes fingers were large tufts of red hair.",
    "She held them aloft\ngleefully then dropped them on the floor.",
    "The door from the street was pushed open and Authority dressed\nin blue stood on the threshold and uttered the regulation words\nmajestically.",
    "Whats going on here\n\nImmediately a common front was presented to the enemy.",
    "Just a bit of fun said one of the young men.",
    "Thats all said Luigi.",
    "Just a bit of fun among friends.",
    "With his foot he kicked the tufts of hair adroitly under the nearest\ntable.",
    "The contestants smiled at each other in false amnesty.",
    "The policeman looked at everybody suspiciously.",
    "Were just going now said the blonde sweetly.",
    "Come on Doug.",
    "By a coincidence several other people were just going.",
    "Authority\nwatched them go grimly.",
    "His eye said that he was overlooking it this\ntime but hed got his eye on them.",
    "He withdrew slowly.",
    "The redheads escort paid the check.",
    "You all right said Luigi to the girl who was adjusting a headscarf.",
    "Lou served you pretty bad tearing out your hair by the roots like\nthat.",
    "It didnt hurt said the girl nonchalantly.",
    "She smiled at him.",
    "Sorry\nfor the row Luigi.",
    "The party went out.",
    "The bar was now practically empty.",
    "I felt in my\npocket for change.",
    "Shes a sport all right said Luigi approvingly watching the door\nclose.",
    "He seized a floor brush and swept the tufts of red hair behind\nthe counter.",
    "It must have been agony I said.",
    "Id have hollered if it had been me admitted Luigi.",
    "But shes a\nreal sport Tommy is.",
    "You know her well\n\nOh shes in here most evenings.",
    "Tuckerton thats her name\nThomasina Tuckerton if you want the whole set out.",
    "But Tommy\nTuckers what shes called round here.",
    "Stinking rich too.",
    "Her old\nman left her a fortune and what does she go and do Comes to\nChelsea lives in a slummy room halfway to Wandsworth Bridge\nand mooches around with a gang all doing the same thing.",
    "Beats\nme half of that crowds got money.",
    "Could have any mortal thing\nthey want stay at the Ritz if they liked.",
    "But they seem to get a kick\nout of living the way they do.",
    "Yes  it beats me.",
    "It wouldnt be your choice\n\nAr Ive got sense said Luigi.",
    "As it is I just cash in.",
    "I rose to go and asked what the quarrel was about.",
    "Oh Tommys got hold of the other girls boyfriend.",
    "Hes not worth\nfighting about believe me\n\n\fThe other girl seemed to think he was I observed.",
    "Oh Lous very romantic said Luigi tolerantly.",
    "It was not my idea of romance but I did not say so.",
    "II\n\nIt must have been about a week later that my eye was caught by a\nname in the Deaths column of The Times.",
    "Tuckerton.",
    "On October 2nd at Fallowfield Nursing Home Amberley\nThomasina Ann aged twenty only daughter of the late Thomas\nTuckerton Esq.",
    "of Carrington Park Amberley Surrey.",
    "Funeral\nprivate.",
    "No flowers.",
    "No flowers for poor Tommy Tucker and no more kicks out of life\nin Chelsea.",
    "I felt a sudden fleeting compassion for the Tommy\nTuckers of today.",
    "Yet after all I reminded myself how did I know\nthat my view was the right one Who was I to pronounce it a wasted\nlife Perhaps it was my life my quiet scholarly life immersed in\nbooks shut off from the world that was the wasted one.",
    "Life at\nsecondhand.",
    "Be honest now was I getting kicks out of life A very\nunfamiliar idea The truth was of course that I didnt want kicks.",
    "But there again perhaps I ought to An unfamiliar and not very\nwelcome thought.",
    "I dismissed Tommy Tucker from my thoughts and turned to my\ncorrespondence.",
    "The principal item was a letter from my cousin Rhoda Despard\nasking me to do her a favor.",
    "I grasped at this since I was not\nfeeling in the mood for work this morning and it made a splendid\nexcuse for postponing it.",
    "I went out into Kings Road hailed a taxi and was driven to the\nresidence of a friend of mine a Mrs Ariadne Oliver.",
    "Mrs Oliver was a wellknown writer of detective stories.",
    "Her maid\nMilly was an efficient dragon who guarded her mistress from the\nonslaughts of the outside world.",
    "I raised my eyebrows inquiringly in an unspoken question.",
    "Milly\nnodded a vehement head.",
    "Youd better go right up Mr Mark she said.",
    "Shes in a mood this\nmorning.",
    "You may be able to help her snap out of it.",
    "I mounted two flights of stairs tapped lightly on a door and walked\nin without waiting for encouragement.",
    "Mrs Olivers workroom was a\ngoodsized room the walls papered with exotic birds nesting in\ntropical foliage.",
    "Mrs Oliver herself in a state apparently bordering\non insanity was prowling round the room muttering to herself.",
    "She\nthrew me a brief uninterested glance and continued to prowl.",
    "Her\n\n\feyes unfocused swept round the walls glanced out of the window\nand occasionally closed in what appeared to be a spasm of agony.",
    "But why demanded Mrs Oliver of the universe why doesnt the\nidiot say at once that he saw the cockatoo Why shouldnt he He\ncouldnt have helped seeing it But if he does mention it it ruins\neverything.",
    "There must be a way... there must be...\n\nShe groaned ran her fingers through her short grey hair and\nclutched it in a frenzied hand.",
    "Then looking at me with suddenly\nfocused eyes she said Hallo Mark.",
    "Im going mad and resumed\nher complaint.",
    "And then theres Monica.",
    "The nicer I try to make her the more\nirritating she gets... such a stupid girl... smug too Monica...\nMonica I believe the names wrong.",

    "Susan Ive had\na Susan.",
    "Lucia Lucia Lucia I believe I can see a Lucia.",
    "Red\nhaired.",
    "Polonecked jumper... lack tights Black stockings\nanyway.",
    "This momentary gleam of good cheer was eclipsed by the memory\nof the cockatoo problem and Mrs Oliver resumed her unhappy\nprowling picking up things off tables unseeingly and putting them\ndown again somewhere else.",
    "She fitted with some care her\nspectacle case into a lacquered box which already contained a\nChinese fan and then gave a deep sigh and said\n\nIm glad its you.",
    "Thats very nice of you.",
    "It might have been anybody.",
    "Some silly woman who wanted me to\nopen a bazaar or the man about Millys insurance card which Milly\nabsolutely refuses to have  or the plumber but that would be too\nmuch good fortune wouldnt it.",
    "Or it might be someone wanting\nan interview  asking me all those embarrassing questions which\nare always the same every time.",
    "What made you first think of taking\nup writing How many books have you written How much money\ndo you make Etc.",
    "etc.",
    "I never know the answers to any of them and\nit makes me look such a fool.",
    "Not that any of that matters because I\nthink I am going mad over this cockatoo business.",
    "Something that wont jell I said sympathetically.",
    "Perhaps Id\nbetter go away.",
    "No dont.",
    "At any rate youre a distraction.",
    "I accepted this doubtful compliment.",
    "Do you want a cigarette Mrs Oliver asked with vague hospitality.",
    "There are some somewhere.",
    "Look in the typewriter lid.",
    "Ive got my own thanks.",
    "Have one.",
    "Oh no you dont smoke.",
    "Or drink said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I wish I did.",
    "Like those American\ndetectives that always have pints of rye conveniently in their desk\ndrawers.",
    "It seems to solve all their problems.",
    "You know Mark I\nreally cant think how anyone ever gets away with a murder in real\n\n\flife.",
    "It seems to me that the moment youve done a murder the\nwhole thing is so terribly obvious.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Youve done lots of them.",
    "Fiftyfive at least said Mrs Oliver.",
    "The murder part is quite easy\nand simple.",
    "Its the covering up thats so difficult.",
    "I mean why\nshould it be anyone else but you You stick out a mile.",
    "Not in the finished article I said.",
    "Ah but what it costs me said Mrs Oliver darkly.",
    "Say what you\nlike its not natural for five or six people to be on the spot when B is\nmurdered and all to have a motive for killing B  unless that is B is\nabsolutely madly unpleasant and in that case nobody will mind\nwhether hes been killed or not and doesnt care in the least whos\ndone it.",
    "I see your problem I said.",
    "But if youve dealt with it successfully\nfiftyfive times you will manage to deal with it once again.",
    "Thats what I tell myself said Mrs Oliver over and over again\nbut every single time I cant believe it and so Im in agony.",
    "She seized her hair again and tugged it violently.",
    "Dont I cried.",
    "Youll have it out by the roots.",
    "Nonsense said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Hairs tough.",
    "Though when I had\nmeasles at fourteen with a very high temperature it did come out \n\n\fall round the front.",
    "Most shaming.",
    "And it was six whole months\nbefore it grew properly again.",
    "Awful for a girl  girls mind so.",
    "I\nthought of it yesterday when I was visiting Mary Delafontaine in that\nnursing home.",
    "Her hair was coming out just like mine did.",
    "She said\nshed have to get a false front when she was better.",
    "If youre sixty it\ndoesnt always grow again I believe.",
    "I saw a girl pull out another girls hair by the roots the other night\nI said.",
    "I was conscious of a slight note of pride in my voice as of one\nwho has seen life.",
    "What extraordinary places have you been going to asked Mrs\nOliver.",
    "This was in a coffee bar in Chelsea.",
    "Oh Chelsea said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Everything happens there I\nbelieve.",
    "Beatniks and sputniks and squares and the beat\ngeneration.",
    "I dont write about them much because Im so afraid of\ngetting the terms wrong.",
    "Its safer I think to stick to what you\nknow.",
    "Such as\n\nPeople on cruises and in hostels and what goes on in hospitals\nand on parish councils  and sales of work  and music festivals and\ngirls in shops and committees and daily women and young men\nand girls who hike round the world in the interests of science and\nshop assistants \n\n\fShe paused out of breath.",
    "That seems fairly comprehensive to be getting on with I said.",
    "All the same you might take me out to a coffee bar in Chelsea\nsome time just to widen my experience said Mrs Oliver wistfully.",
    "Any time you say.",
    "Tonight\n\nNot tonight.",
    "Im too busy writing or rather worrying because I cant\nwrite.",
    "Thats really the most tiresome thing about writing  though\neverything is tiresome really except the one moment when you get\nwhat you think is going to be a wonderful idea and can hardly wait\nto begin.",
    "Tell me Mark do you think it is possible to kill someone by\nremote control\n\nWhat do you mean by remote control Press a button and set off a\nradioactive death ray\n\nNo no not science fiction.",
    "I suppose she paused doubtfully I\nreally mean black magic.",
    "Wax figures and pins in them\n\nOh wax figures are right out said Mrs Oliver scornfully.",
    "But\nqueer things do happen  in Africa or the West Indies.",
    "People are\nalways telling you so.",
    "How natives just curl up and die.",
    "Voodoo  or\njuju... anyway you know what I mean.",
    "I said that much of that was attributed nowadays to the power of\nsuggestion.",
    "Word is always conveyed to the victim that his death\nhas been decreed by the medicine man  and his subconscious\ndoes the rest.",
    "Mrs Oliver snorted.",
    "If anyone hinted to me that I had been doomed to lie down and die\nId take a pleasure in thwarting their expectations\n\nI laughed.",
    "Youve got centuries of good Occidental sceptical blood in your\nveins.",
    "No predispositions.",
    "Then you think it can happen\n\nI dont know enough about the subject to judge.",
    "What put it into\nyour head Is your new masterpiece to be Murder by Suggestion\n\nNo indeed.",
    "Good oldfashioned rat poison or arsenic is good\nenough for me.",
    "Or the reliable blunt instrument.",
    "Not firearms if\npossible.",
    "Firearms are so tricky.",
    "But you didnt come here to talk to\nme about my books.",
    "Frankly no  The fact is that my cousin Rhoda Despard has got a\nchurch f\u043ate and \n\n\fNever again said Mrs Oliver.",
    "You know what happened last\ntime I arranged a Murder Hunt and the first thing that happened\nwas a real corpse.",
    "Ive never quite got over it\n\nIts not a Murder Hunt.",
    "All youd have to do would be to sit in a tent\nand sign your own books  at five bob a time.",
    "Weelll said Mrs Oliver doubtfully.",
    "That might be all right.",
    "I\nshouldnt have to open the f\u043ate Or say silly things Or have to wear\na hat\n\nNone of these things I assured her would be required of her.",
    "And it would only be for an hour or two I said coaxingly.",
    "After\nthat therell be a cricket match  no I suppose not this time of year.",
    "Children dancing perhaps.",
    "Or a fancy dress competition \n\nMrs Oliver interrupted me with a wild scream.",
    "Thats it she cried.",
    "A cricket ball Of course He sees it from the\nwindow... rising up in the air... and it distracts him  and so he never\nmentions the cockatoo What a good thing you came Mark.",
    "Youve\nbeen wonderful.",
    "I dont quite see \n\nPerhaps not but I do said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Its all rather complicated\nand I dont want to waste time explaining.",
    "Nice as its been to see\nyou what Id really like you to do now is to go away.",
    "At once.",
    "Certainly.",
    "About the f\u043ate \n\nIll think about it.",
    "Dont worry me now.",
    "Now where on earth did I\nput my spectacles Really the way things just disappear...\n\nChapter 2\n\nMrs Gerahty opened the door of the presbytery in her usual sharp\npouncing style.",
    "It was less like answering a bell than a triumphant\nmaneuver expressing the sentiment Ive caught you this time\n\nWell now and what would you be wanting she demanded\nbelligerently.",
    "There was a boy on the doorstep a very negligible looking boy  a\nboy not easily noticeable nor easily remembered  a boy like a lot of\nother boys.",
    "He sniffed because he had a cold in his head.",
    "Is this the priests place\n\nIs it Father Gorman youre wanting\n\nHes wanted said the boy.",
    "Who wants him and where and what for\n\n\fBenthall Street.",

    "How\nmuch of it was born of delirium and high fever Some of it was true\nof course  but how much Anyway it was important to make a note\nof certain names while they were fresh in his memory.",
    "The St\nFrancis Guild would be assembled when he got back.",
    "He turned\nabruptly into a small caf\u0439 ordered a cup of coffee and sat down.",
    "He\nfelt in the pocket of his cassock.",
    "Ah Mrs Gerahty  hed asked her\nto mend the lining.",
    "As usual she hadnt His notebook and a loose\npencil and the few coins he carried about him had gone through to\nthe lining.",
    "He prised up a coin or two and the pencil but the\n\n\fnotebook was too difficult.",
    "The coffee came and he asked if he\ncould have a piece of paper.",
    "This do you\n\nIt was a torn paper bag.",
    "Father Gorman nodded and took it.",
    "He\nbegan to write.",
    "The names  it was important not to forget the\nnames.",
    "Names were the sort of thing he did forget.",
    "The caf\u0439 door opened and three young lads in Edwardian dress\ncame in and sat down noisily.",
    "Father Gorman finished his memorandum.",
    "He folded up the scrap\nof paper and was about to shove it into his pocket when he\nremembered the hole.",
    "He did what he had often done before\npressed the folded scrap down into his shoe.",
    "A man came in quietly and sat down in a far corner.",
    "Father Gorman\ntook a sip or two of the weak coffee for politeness sake called for\nhis bill and paid.",
    "Then he got up and went out.",
    "The man who had just come in seemed to change his mind.",
    "He\nlooked at his watch as though he had mistaken the time got up and\nhurried out.",
    "The fog was coming on fast.",
    "Father Gorman quickened his steps.",
    "He knew his district very well.",
    "He took a shortcut by turning down\nthe small street which ran close by the railway.",
    "He may have been\nconscious of steps behind him but he thought nothing of them.",
    "Why\nshould he\n\n\fThe blow from the cosh caught him completely unaware.",
    "He heeled\nforward and fell.",
    "III\n\nDr Corrigan whistling Father OFlynn walked into the D.D.I.s\nroom and addressed Divisional DetectiveInspector Lejeune in a\nchatty manner.",
    "I ve done your padre for you he said.",
    "And the result\n\nWell save the technical terms for the coroner.",
    "Well and truly\ncoshed.",
    "First blow probably killed him but whoever it was made\nsure.",
    "Quite a nasty business.",
    "Yes said Lejeune.",
    "He was a sturdy man dark haired and grey eyed.",
    "He had a\nmisleadingly quiet manner but his gestures were sometimes\nsurprisingly graphic and betrayed his French Huguenot ancestry.",
    "He said thoughtfully\n\nNastier than would be necessary for robbery\n\n\fWas it robbery asked the doctor.",
    "One supposes so.",
    "His pockets were turned out and the lining of his\ncassock ripped.",
    "They couldnt have hoped for much said Corrigan.",
    "Poor as a rat\nmost of these parish priests.",
    "They battered his head in to make sure mused Lejeune.",
    "One\nwould like to know why.",
    "Two possible answers said Corrigan.",
    "One it was done by a\nviciousminded young thug who likes violence for violences sake there are plenty of them about these days mores the pity.",
    "And the other answer.",
    "The doctor shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Somebody had it in for your Father Gorman.",
    "Was that likely\n\nLejeune shook his head.",
    "Most unlikely.",
    "He was a popular man well loved in the district.",
    "No\nenemies as far as one can hear.",
    "And robberys unlikely.",
    "Unless \n\nUnless what asked Corrigan.",
    "The police have a clue Am I\nright\n\n\fHe did have something on him that wasnt taken away.",
    "It was in his\nshoe as a matter of fact.",
    "Corrigan whistled.",
    "Sounds like a spy story.",
    "Lejeune smiled.",
    "Its much simpler than that.",
    "He had a hole in his pocket.",
    "Sergeant\nPine talked to his housekeeper.",
    "Shes a bit of a slattern it seems.",
    "Didnt keep his clothes mended in the way she might have done.",
    "She admitted that now and again Father Gorman would thrust a\npaper or a letter down the side of his shoe to prevent it from going\ndown into the lining of his cassock.",
    "And the killer didnt know that\n\nThe killer never thought of that Assuming that is that this piece\nof paper is what he may have been wanting rather than a miserly\namount of small change.",
    "What was on the paper\n\nLejeune reached into a drawer and took out a flimsy piece of\ncreased paper.",
    "Just a list of names he said.",
    "Corrigan looked at it curiously.",
    "Ormerod\n\nSandford\n\nParkinson\n\nHeskethDubois\n\nShaw\n\nHarmondsworth\n\nTuckerton\n\nCorrigan\n\nDelafontaine\n\nHis eyebrows rose.",
    "I see Im on the list\n\nDo any of the names mean anything to you asked the inspector.",
    "None of them.",
    "And youve never met Father Gorman\n\n\fNever.",
    "Then you wont be able to help us much.",
    "Any ideas as to what this list means  if anything\n\nLejeune did not reply directly.",
    "A boy called at Father Gormans about seven oclock in the\nevening.",
    "Said a woman was dying and wanted the priest.",
    "Father\nGorman went with him.",
    "Where to If you know\n\nWe know.",
    "It didnt take long to check up.",
    "Twentythree Benthall\nStreet.",
    "House owned by a woman named Coppins.",
    "The sick woman\nwas a Mrs Davis.",
    "The priest got there at a quarter past seven and\nwas with her for about half an hour.",
    "Mrs Davis died just before the\nambulance arrived to take her to hospital.",
    "I see.",
    "The next we hear of Father Gorman is at Tonys Place a small\ndownatheel caf\u0439.",
    "Quite decent nothing criminal about it serves\nrefreshment of poor quality and isnt much patronized.",
    "Father\nGorman asked for a cup of coffee.",
    "Then apparently he felt in his\npocket couldnt find what he wanted and asked the proprietor\nTony for a piece of paper.",
    "This  he gestured with his finger is the\npiece of paper.",
    "And then\n\nWhen Tony brought the coffee the priest was writing on the paper.",
    "Shortly afterwards he left leaving his coffee practically untasted\nfor which I dont blame him having completed this list and shoved\nit into his shoe.",
    "Anybody else in the place\n\nThree boys of the Teddyboy type came in and sat at one table and\nan elderly man came in and sat at another.",
    "The latter went away\nwithout ordering.",
    "He followed the priest\n\nCould be.",
    "Tony didnt notice when he went.",
    "Didnt notice what he\nlooked like either.",
    "Described him as an inconspicuous type of man.",
    "Respectable.",
    "The kind of man that looks like everybody else.",
    "Medium height he thinks dark blue overcoat  or could be brown.",
    "Not very dark and not very fair.",
    "No reason he should have had\nanything to do with it.",
    "One just doesnt know.",
    "He hasnt come\nforward to say he saw the priest in Tonys place  but its early days\nyet.",
    "Were asking for anyone who saw Father Gorman between a\nquarter to eight and eightfifteen to communicate with us.",
    "Only two\npeople so far have responded a woman and a chemist who had a\nshop nearby.",
    "Ill be going to see them presently.",
    "His body was\nfound at eightfifteen by two small boys in West Street  you know\nit Practically an alleyway bounded by the railway on one side.",
    "The\nrest  you know.",
    "Corrigan nodded.",
    "He tapped the paper.",
    "Whats your feeling about this\n\nI think its important said Lejeune.",
    "The dying woman told him something and he got these names\ndown on paper as soon as he could before he forgot them The only\nthing is  would he have done that if hed been told under seal of the\nconfessional\n\nIt neednt have been under a seal of secrecy said Lejeune.",
    "Suppose for instance these names have a connection of  say\nblackmail.",
    "Thats your idea is it\n\nI havent any ideas yet.",
    "This is just a working hypothesis.",
    "These\npeople were being blackmailed.",
    "The dying woman was either the\nblackmailer or she knew about the blackmail.",
    "Id say that the\ngeneral idea was repentance confession and a wish to make\nreparation as far as possible.",
    "Father Gorman assumed the\nresponsibility.",
    "And then\n\nEverything else is conjectural said Lejeune.",
    "Say it was a paying\nracket and someone didnt want it to stop paying.",
    "Someone knew\n\n\fMrs Davis was dying and that shed sent for the priest.",
    "The rest\nfollows.",
    "I wonder now said Corrigan studying the paper again.",
    "Why do\nyou think theres an interrogation mark after the last two names\n\nIt could be that Father Gorman wasnt sure hed remembered\nthose two names correctly.",
    "It might have been Mulligan instead of Corrigan agreed the\ndoctor with a grin.",
    "Thats likely enough.",
    "But Id say that with a\nname like Delafontaine either youd remember it or you wouldnt  if\nyou know what I mean.",
    "Its odd that there isnt a single address.",
    "He\nread down the list again.",
    "Parkinson  lots of Parkinsons.",
    "Sandford not uncommon HeskethDubois  thats a bit of a mouthful.",
    "Cant be many of them.",
    "On a sudden impulse he leaned forward and took the telephone\ndirectory from the desk.",
    "E to L. Lets see.",
    "Hesketh Mrs A... John and Company Plumbers...\nSir Isidore.",
    "Ah here we are HeskethDubois Lady.",
    "Fortynine\nEllesmere Square S.W.I.",
    "What say we just ring her up\n\nSaying what\n\nInspiration will come said Doctor Corrigan airily.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "said Lejeune.",
    "What Corrigan stared at him.",
    "I said go ahead Lejeune spoke mildly.",
    "Dont look so taken\naback.",
    "He himself picked up the receiver.",
    "Give me an outside\nline.",
    "He looked at Corrigan.",
    "Number\n\nGrosvenor 64578.",
    "Lejeune repeated it then handed the receiver over to Corrigan.",
    "Enjoy yourself.",
    "he said.",
    "Faintly puzzled Corrigan looked at him as he waited.",
    "The ringing\ntone continued for some time before anyone answered.",
    "Then\ninterspersed with heavy breathing a womans voice said\n\nGrosvenor 64578.",
    "Is that Lady HeskethDubois house\n\nWell  well yes  I mean \n\nDoctor Corrigan ignored these uncertainties.",
    "Can I speak to her please\n\nNo that you cant do Lady HeskethDubois died last April.",
    "Oh Startled.",
    "Dr Corrigan ignored the Who is it speaking\nplease and gently replaced the receiver.",
    "He looked coldly at Inspector Lejeune.",
    "So thats why you were so ready to let me ring up.",
    "Lejeune smiled maliciously.",
    "We dont really neglect the obvious he pointed out.",
    "Last April said Corrigan thoughtfully.",
    "Five months ago.",
    "Five\nmonths since blackmail or whatever it was has failed to worry her.",
    "She didnt commit suicide or anything like that\n\nNo.",
    "She died of a tumour on the brain.",
    "So now we start again said Corrigan looking down at the list.",
    "Lejeune sighed.",
    "We dont really know that list had anything to do with it he\npointed out.",
    "It may have been just an ordinary coshing on a foggy\nnight  and precious little hope of finding who did it unless we have\na piece of luck...\n\nDr Corrigan said\n\nDo you mind if I continue to concentrate on this list\n\n\fGo ahead.",
    "I wish you all the luck in the world.",
    "Meaning Im not likely to get anywhere if you havent Dont be too\nsure.",
    "I shall concentrate on Corrigan.",
    "Mr or Mrs or Miss Corrigan with a big interrogation mark.",
    "Chapter 3\n\nWell really Mr Lejeune I dont see what more I can tell you I told\nit all before to your sergeant.",
    "I dont know who Mrs Davis was or\nwhere she came from.",
    "Shed been with me about six months.",
    "She\npaid her rent regular and she seemed a nice quiet respectable\nperson and what more you expect me to say Im sure I dont know.",
    "Mrs Coppins paused for breath and looked at Lejeune with some\ndispleasure.",
    "He gave her the gentle melancholy smile which he\nknew by experience was not without its effect.",
    "Not that I wouldnt be willing to help if I could she amended.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thats what we need  help.",
    "Women know  they feel\ninstinctively  so much more than a man can know.",
    "It was a good gambit and it worked.",
    "Ah said Mrs Coppins.",
    "I wish Coppins could hear you.",
    "So hoitytoity and offhand he always was.",
    "Saying you know things when you\n\n\fhavent anything to go on hed say and snort.",
    "And nine times out of\nten I was right.",
    "Thats why Id like to hear what ideas you have about Mrs Davis.",
    "Was she  an unhappy woman do you think\n\nNow as to that  no I wouldnt say so.",
    "Businesslike.",
    "Thats what\nshe always seemed.",
    "Methodical.",
    "As though shed got her life\nplanned and was acting accordingly.",
    "She had a job I understood\nwith one of these consumer research associations.",
    "Going around\nand asking people what soap powder they used or flour and what\nthey spend on their weekly budget and how its divided up.",
    "Of\ncourse Ive always felt that sort of thing is snooping really  and why\nthe Government or anyone else wants to know beats me All you\nhear at the end of it is only what everybody has known perfectly\nwell all along but there theres a craze for that sort of thing\nnowadays.",
    "And if youve got to have it I should say that poor Mrs\nDavis would do the job very nicely.",
    "A pleasant manner not nosy\njust businesslike and matteroffact.",
    "You dont know the actual name of the firm or association that\nemployed her\n\nNo.",
    "I dont Im afraid.",
    "Did she ever mention relatives\n\nNo.",
    "I gathered she was a widow and had lost her husband many\nyears ago.",
    "A bit of an invalid hed been but she never talked much\nabout him.",
    "She didnt mention where she came from  what part of the\ncountry\n\nI dont think she was a Londoner.",
    "Came from somewhere up north\nI should say.",
    "You didnt feel there was anything  well mysterious about her\n\nLejeune felt a doubt as he spoke.",
    "If she was a suggestible woman But Mrs Coppins did not take advantage of the opportunity offered\nto her.",
    "Well I cant say really that I did.",
    "Certainly not from anything she\never said.",
    "The only thing that perhaps might have made me wonder\nwas her suitcase.",
    "Good quality it was but not new.",
    "And the initials\non it had been painted over.",
    "I.D.",
    "Jessie Davis.",
    "But originally it had\nbeen something else.",
    "H I think.",
    "But it might have been an A.",
    "Still I\ndidnt think anything of that at the time.",
    "You can often pick up a\ngood piece of luggage secondhand ever so cheap and then its\nnatural to get the initials altered.",
    "She hadnt a lot of stuff  only the\none case.",
    "Lejeune knew that.",
    "The dead woman had had curiously few\npersonal possessions.",
    "No letters had been kept no photographs.",
    "She had had apparently no insurance card no bank book no check\nbook.",
    "Her clothes were of good everyday serviceable quality\nnearly new.",
    "She seemed quite happy he asked.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "He pounced on the faint doubtful tone in her voice.",
    "You only suppose so\n\nWell its not the kind of thing you think about is it I should say\nshe was nicely off with a good job and quite satisfied with her life.",
    "She wasnt the bubbling over sort.",
    "But of course when she got ill \n\nYes when she got ill he prompted her.",
    "Vexed she was at first.",
    "When she went down with flu I mean.",
    "It\nwould put all her schedule out she said.",
    "Missing appointments and\nall that.",
    "But flus flu and you cant ignore it when its there.",
    "So she\nstopped in bed and made herself tea on the gas ring and took\naspirin.",
    "I said why not have the doctor and she said no point in it.",
    "Nothing to do for flu but stay in bed and keep warm and Id better\nnot come near her to catch it.",
    "I did a bit of cooking for her when she\ngot better.",
    "Hot soup and toast.",
    "And a rice pudding now and again.",
    "It\ngot her down of course flu does  but not more than whats usual\nId say.",
    "Its after the fever goes down that you get the depression and she got that like everyone does.",
    "She sat there by the gas fire I\nremember and said to me I wish one didnt have so much time to\nthink.",
    "I dont like having time to think.",
    "It gets me down.",
    "Lejeune continued to look deeply attentive and Mrs Coppins\nwarmed to her theme.",
    "Lent her some magazines I did.",
    "But she didnt seem able to keep\nher mind on reading.",
    "Said once I remember If things arent all they\nshould be its better not to know about it dont you agree And I\nsaid Thats right dearie.",
    "And she said I dont know  Ive never\nreally been sure.",
    "And I said that was all right then.",
    "And she said\nEverything Ive done has always been perfectly straightforward\nand aboveboard.",
    "Ive nothing to reproach myself with.",
    "And I said\nOf course you havent dear.",
    "But I did just wonder in my own mind\nwhether in the firm that employed her there mightnt have been\nsome funny business with the accounts maybe and shed got wind\nof it  but had felt it wasnt really her business.",
    "Possible agreed Lejeune.",
    "Anyway she got well again  or nearly so and went back to work.",
    "I\ntold her it was too soon.",
    "Give yourself another day or two I said.",
    "And there how right I was Come back the second evening she\ndid and I could see at once shed got a high fever.",
    "Couldnt hardly\nclimb the stairs.",
    "You must have the doctor I says but no she\nwouldnt.",
    "Worse and worse she got all that day her eyes glassy\nand her cheeks like fire and her breathing terrible.",
    "And the next\nday in the evening she said to me hardly able to get the words out\nA priest.",
    "I must have a priest.",
    "And quickly... or it will be too late.",
    "But it wasnt our vicar she wanted.",
    "It had to be a Roman Catholic\npriest.",
    "I never knew she was a Roman never any crucifix about or\nanything like that.",
    "But there had been a crucifix tucked away at the bottom of the\nsuitcase.",
    "Lejeune did not mention it.",
    "He sat listening.",
    "I saw young Mike in the street and I sent him for that Father\nGorman at St Dominics.",
    "And I rang the doctor and the hospital on\nmy own account not saying nothing to her.",
    "You took the priest up to her when he came\n\nYes I did.",
    "And left them together.",
    "Did either of them say anything\n\nWell now I cant exactly remember.",
    "I was talking myself saying\nhere was the priest and now shed be all right trying to cheer her\nup but I do call to mind now as I closed the door I heard her say\nsomething about wickedness.",
    "Yes  and something too about a\nhorse  horse racing maybe.",
    "I like a halfcrown on myself\noccasionally but theres a lot of crookedness goes on in racing so\nthey say.",
    "Wickedness said Lejeune.",
    "He was struck by the word.",
    "Have to confess their sins dont they Romans before they die So\nI suppose that was it.",
    "Lejeune did not doubt that that was it but his imagination was\nstirred by the word used.",
    "Wickedness...\n\nSomething rather special in wickedness he thought if the priest\nwho knew about it was followed and clubbed to death.",
    "II\n\nThere was nothing to be learned from the other three lodgers in the\nhouse.",
    "Two of them a bank clerk and an elderly man who worked in\na shoe shop had been there for some years.",
    "The third was a girl of\ntwentytwo who had come there recently and had a job in a nearby\ndepartment store.",
    "All three of them barely knew Mrs Davis by sight.",
    "The woman who had reported having seen Father Gorman in the\nstreet that evening had no useful information to give.",
    "She was a\nCatholic who attended St Dominics and she knew Father Gorman\nby sight.",
    "She had seen him turn out of Benthall Street and go into\nTonys Place about ten minutes to eight.",
    "That was all.",
    "Mr Osborne\nthe proprietor of the chemists shop on the corner of Barton Street\nhad a better contribution to make.",
    "He was a small middleaged man with a bald domed head a round\ningenuous face and glasses.",
    "Good evening Chief Inspector.",
    "Come behind will you He held\nup the flap of an oldfashioned counter.",
    "Lejeune passed behind and\nthrough a dispensing alcove where a young man in a white overall\nwas making up bottles of medicine with the swiftness of a\nprofessional conjurer and so through an archway into a tiny room\nwith a couple of easy chairs a table and a desk.",
    "Mr Osborne pulled\nthe curtain of the archway behind him in a secretive manner and\nsat down in one chair motioning to Lejeune to take the other.",
    "He\nleaned forward his eyes glinting in pleasurable excitement.",
    "It just happens that I may be able to assist you.",
    "It wasnt a busy\nevening  nothing much to do the weather being unfavourable.",
    "My\nyoung lady was behind the counter.",
    "We keep open until eight on\nThursday always.",
    "The fog was coming on and there werent many\npeople about.",
    "Id gone to the door to look at the weather thinking to\nmyself that the fog was coming up fast.",
    "The weather forecast had\nsaid it would.",
    "I stood there for a bit  nothing going on inside that my\nyoung lady couldnt deal with  face creams and bath salts and all\nthat.",
    "Then I saw Father Gorman coming along on the other side of\nthe street.",
    "I know him quite well by sight of course.",
    "A shocking\nthing this murder attacking a man so well thought of as he is.",
    "Theres Father Gorman I said to myself.",
    "He was going in the\ndirection of West Street its the next turn on the left before the\nrailway as you know.",
    "A little way behind him there was another\nman.",
    "It wouldnt have entered my head to notice or think anything of\nthat but quite suddenly this second man came to a stop  quite\nabruptly just when he was level with my door.",
    "I wondered why hed\nstopped  and then I noticed that Father Gorman a little way ahead\nwas slowing down.",
    "He didnt quite stop.",
    "It was as though he was\nthinking of something so hard that he almost forgot he was walking.",
    "Then he started on again and this other man started to walk too rather fast.",
    "I thought  inasmuch as I thought at all that perhaps it\nwas someone who knew Father Gorman and wanted to catch him\nup and speak to him.",
    "But in actual fact he could simply have been following him\n\nThats what Im sure he was doing now  not that I thought anything\nof it at the time.",
    "What with the fog coming up I lost sight of them\nboth almost at once.",
    "Can you describe this man at all\n\nLejeunes voice was not confident.",
    "He was prepared for the usual\nnondescript characteristics.",
    "But Mr Osborne was made of different\nmettle from Tony of Tonys Place.",
    "Well yes I think so he said with complacency.",
    "He was a tall\nman \n\nTall How tall\n\nWell  five eleven to six feet at least Id say.",
    "Though he might have\nseemed taller than he was because he was very thin.",
    "Sloping\nshoulders he had and a definite Adams apple.",
    "Grew his hair rather\nlong under his Homburg.",
    "A great beak of a nose.",
    "Very noticeable.",
    "Naturally I couldnt say as to the colour of his eyes.",
    "I saw him in\nprofile as youll appreciate.",
    "Perhaps fifty as to age.",
    "Im going by the\nwalk.",
    "A youngish man moves quite differently.",
    "Lejeune made a mental survey of the distance across the street\nthen back again to Mr Osborne and wondered.",
    "He wondered very\nmuch...\n\nA description such as that given by the chemist could mean one of\ntwo things.",
    "It could spring from an unusually vivid imagination  he\nhad known many examples of that kind mostly from women.",
    "They\nbuilt up a fancy portrait of what they thought a murderer ought to\nlook like.",
    "Such fancy portraits however usually contained some\ndecidedly spurious details  such as rolling eyes beetle brows ape\n\n\flike jaws snarling ferocity.",
    "The description given by Mr Osborne\nsounded like the description of a real person.",
    "In that case it was\npossible that here was the witness in a million  a man who\nobserved accurately and in detail and who would be quite\nunshakable as to what he had seen.",
    "Again Lejeune considered the distance across the street.",
    "His eyes\nrested thoughtfully on the chemist.",
    "He asked Do you think you would recognize this man if you saw\nhim again\n\nOh yes Mr Osborne was supremely confident.",
    "I never forget a\nface.",
    "Its one of my hobbies.",
    "Ive always said that if one of these wife\nmurderers came into my place and bought a nice little package of\narsenic Id be able to swear to him at the trial.",
    "Ive always had my\nhopes that something like that would happen one day.",
    "But it hasnt happened yet\n\nMr Osborne admitted sadly that it hadnt.",
    "And not likely to now he added wistfully.",
    "Im selling this\nbusiness.",
    "Getting a very nice price for it and retiring to\nBournemouth.",
    "It looks a nice place youve got here.",
    "Its got class said Mr Osborne a note of pride in his voice.",
    "Nearly a hundred years weve been established here.",
    "My\n\n\fgrandfather and my father before me.",
    "A good oldfashioned family\nbusiness.",
    "Not that I saw it that way as a boy.",
    "Stuffy I thought it.",
    "Like\nmany a lad I was bitten by the stage.",
    "Felt sure I could act.",
    "My father\ndidnt try to stop me.",
    "See what you can make of it my boy he said.",

    "Oh but just think said David.",
    "Its rather like madness.",
    "If you\nhave someone who raves and staggers about with straws in their\nhair and looks mad its not frightening at all But I remember being\nsent once with a message to a doctor at a mental home and I was\nshown into a room to wait and there was a nice elderly lady there\nsipping a glass of milk.",

    "Afterwards the medium sits up pats her hair and\ngoes home to a meal of fish and chips just an ordinary quite jolly\nwoman.",
    "So your idea of the witches I said is three old Scottish crones\nwith second sight  who practise their arts in secret muttering their\nspells round a cauldron conjuring up spirits but remaining\nthemselves just an ordinary trio of old women.",
    "Yes  it could be\nimpressive.",
    "If you could ever get any actors to play it that way said Hermia\ndryly.",
    "You have something there admitted David.",
    "Any hint of madness\nin the script and an actor is immediately determined to go to town\non it The same with sudden deaths.",

    "How convenient it must have been in\nthose times he went on to be able to call up a handy murderer\nwhenever you wanted a little job done.",
    "Fun if one could do it\nnowadays.",
    "But it is done protested Hermia.",
    "Gangsters.",
    "Hoods or whatever\nyou call them.",
    "Chicago and all that.",
    "Ah said David.",
    "But what I meant was not gangsterdom not\nracketeers or Crime Barons.",
    "Just ordinary everyday folk who want\nto get rid of someone.",
    "That business rival Aunt Emily so rich and\nso unfortunately longlived that awkward husband always in the\nway.",
    "How convenient if you could ring up Harrods and say Please\nsend along two good murderers will you\n\nWe all laughed.",
    "But one can do that in a way cant one said Poppy.",
    "We turned towards her.",
    "What way poppet asked David.",
    "Well I mean people can do that if they want to... People like us as\nyou said.",
    "Only I believe its very expensive.",
    "Poppys eyes were wide and ingenuous her lips were slightly\nparted.",
    "What do you mean asked David curiously.",
    "Poppy looked confused.",
    "Oh  I expect  Ive got it mixed.",
    "I meant the Pale Horse.",
    "All that sort\nof thing.",
    "A pale horse What kind of a pale horse\n\nPoppy flushed and her eyes dropped.",
    "Im being stupid.",
    "Its just something someone mentioned  but I\nmust have got it all wrong.",
    "Have some lovely Coupe Nesselrode said David kindly.",
    "II\n\nOne of the oddest things in life as we all know is the way that when\nyou have heard a thing mentioned within twentyfour hours you\nnearly always come across it again.",
    "I had an instance of that the\nnext morning.",
    "My telephone rang and I answered it.",
    "Flaxman 73841.",
    "A kind of gasp came through the phone.",
    "Then a voice said\nbreathlessly but defiantly\n\n\fIve thought about it and Ill come\n\nI cast round wildly in my mind.",
    "Splendid I said stalling for time.",
    "Er  is that \n\nAfter all said the voice lightning never strikes twice.",

    "People coming up to me\nand saying am I writing something just now  when youd think they\ncould see Im drinking ginger ale or tomato juice and not writing at\nall.",
    "And saying they like my books  which of course is pleasing but\nIve never found the right answer.",
    "If you say Im so glad it sounds\nlike Pleased to meet you.",
    "A kind of stock phrase.",
    "Well it is of\n\n\fcourse.",
    "And you dont think theyll want me to go out to the Pink\nHorse and have drinks\n\nThe Pink Horse\n\nWell the Pale Horse.",
    "Pubs I mean.",

    "This time it was Mr Soames White a distinguished solicitor who\nrang up to remind me that under the will of my godmother Lady\nHeskethDubois I was entitled to choose three of her pictures.",
    "There is nothing outstandingly valuable of course said Mr\nSoames White in his defeatist melancholy tones.",
    "But I understand\nthat at some time you expressed admiration of some of the pictures\nto the deceased.",
    "She had some very charming watercolors of Indian scenes I said.",
    "I believe you already have written to me about this matter but Im\nafraid it slipped my memory.",
    "Quite so said Mr Soames White.",
    "But probate has now been\ngranted and the executors of whom I am one are arranging for the\nsale of the effects of her London house.",
    "If you could go round to\nEllesmere Square in the near future \n\nIll go now I said.",
    "It seemed an unfavourable morning for work.",
    "III\n\nCarrying the three watercolors of my choice under my arm I\nemerged from Fortynine Ellesmere Square and immediately\ncannoned into someone coming up the steps to the front door.",

    "And some of these vewy vewy special leaves with them\n\nI looked dubiously at the special leaves which appeared to be in an\nadvanced state of decay.",
    "Instead I chose some bright green\nasparagus fern which choice obviously lowered me in Poppys\nestimation.",
    "There was something I wanted to ask you I reiterated as Poppy\nwas rather clumsily draping the asparagus fern round the roses.",
    "The other evening you mentioned something called the Pale\nHorse.",
    "With a violent start Poppy dropped the roses and the asparagus\nfern on the floor.",

    "Theyve been very clever in\nmaking it comfortable without spoiling its character.",
    "Ill ring up Thyrza tomorrow morning said Rhoda.",
    "I must admit that I went to bed with a slight feeling of deflation.",
    "The Pale Horse which had loomed in my mind as a symbol of\nsomething unknown and sinister had turned out to be nothing of the\nsort.",
    "Unless of course there was another Pale Horse somewhere else\n\nI considered that idea until I fell asleep.",

    "Its very sad for him because up to then he was a great traveller I\nbelieve.",
    "Of course hes rolling in money and as I say hes done up\n\n\fthe house in a wonderful way  it was an absolute ruin falling to\npieces.",
    "Its full of the most gorgeous stuff.",
    "The sale rooms are his\nprincipal interest nowadays I believe.",

    "Oh I enjoy that kind of thing.",
    "Part of English rural life isnt it I\ncame home clasping a most terrible Kewpie doll from the hoopla\nand had a splendid but unrealistic future prophesied me by Our\nSybil all dressed up in a tinsel turban with about a ton of fake\nEgyptian beads slung over her torso.",
    "Good old Sybil said Colonel Despard.",

    "I\nalways feel that that place had had a mysterious and unusually\nwicked past history.",
    "It cant have been smuggling were not near\nenough to the sea for that.",
    "A resort for highwaymen perhaps Or\nrich travellers spent the night there and were never seen again.",
    "It\nseems somehow rather tame to have turned it into a desirable\nresidence for three old maids.",
    "Oh  I never think of them like that cried Rhoda.",
    "Sybil\nStamfordis perhaps with her saris and her scarabs and always\nseeing auras round peoples heads  she is rather ridiculous.",
    "But\ntheres something really aweinspiring about Thyrza dont you\nagree You feel she knows just what youre thinking.",
    "She doesnt\ntalk about having second sight  but everyone says that she has got\nit.",
    "And Bella far from being an old maid has buried two husbands\nadded Colonel Despard.",

    "With sinister interpretations of the deaths from the neighbours\nadded Despard.",
    "Its said they displeased her so she just turned\nher eyes on them and they slowly sickened and pined away\n\nOf course I forgot she is the local witch\n\nSo Mrs Dane Calthrop says.",
    "Interesting thing witchcraft said Venables thoughtfully.",
    "All over\nthe world you get variations of it  I remember when I was in East\nAfrica \n\nHe talked easily and entertainingly on the subject He spoke of\nmedicine men in Africa of little known cults in Borneo.",
    "He promised\nthat after lunch he would show us some West African sorcerers\nmasks.",
    "Theres everything in this house declared Rhoda with a laugh.",

    "Just for a moment there was a sudden bitterness in his voice.",
    "He\ngave a swift glance downwards towards his paralyzed legs.",
    "The world is so full of a number of things he quoted.",

    "She asked because she wanted to know.",
    "And her frank\ncuriosity restored the lighthearted atmosphere.",
    "Venables looked towards her inquiringly.",
    "I mean said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Why did you come to live here in this\nneighbourhood So far away from things that are going on.",
    "Was it\nbecause you had friends here\n\nNo.",
    "I chose this part of the world since you are interested\nbecause I had no friends here.",
    "A faint ironical smile touched his lips.",
    "How deeply I wondered had his disability affected him Had the\nloss of unfettered movement of liberty to explore the world bitten\ndeep into his soul Or had he managed to adapt himself to altered\ncircumstances with comparative equanimity  with a real greatness\nof spirit.",
    "As though Venables had read my thoughts he said\n\nIn your article you questioned the meaning of the term greatness\n you compared the different meanings attached to it  in the East\nand the West.",
    "But what do we all mean nowadays here in England\nwhen we use the term a great man\n\n\fGreatness of intellect certainly I said and surely moral\nstrength as well\n\nHe looked at me his eyes bright and shining.",
    "Is there no such thing as an evil man then who can be described\nas great he asked.",
    "Of course there is cried Rhoda.",
    "Napoleon and Hitler and oh lots\nof people.",
    "They were all great men.",
    "Because of the effect they produced said Despard.",
    "But if one\nhad known them personally I wonder if one would have been\nimpressed.",
    "Ginger leaned forward and ran her fingers through her carroty mop\nof hair.",
    "Thats an interesting thought she said.",
    "Mightnt they perhaps\nhave\n\nseemed\n\npathetic\n\nundersized\n\nlittle\n\nfigures.",
    "Strutting\n\nposturing feeling inadequate determined to be someone even if\nthey pulled the world down round them\n\nOh no said Rhoda vehemently.",
    "They couldnt have produced\nthe results they did if they had been like that\n\nI dont know said Mrs Oliver.",
    "After all the stupidest child can set\na house on fire quite easily.",
    "Come come said Venables.",
    "I really cant go along with this\nmodern playing down of evil as something that doesnt really exist.",
    "There is evil.",
    "And evil is powerful.",
    "Sometimes more powerful than\ngood.",
    "Its there.",
    "It has to be recognised  and fought.",
    "Otherwise \nhe spread out his hands.",
    "We go down to darkness.",
    "Of course I was brought up on the devil said Mrs Oliver\napologetically.",
    "Believing in him I mean.",
    "But you know he always\ndid seem to me so silly.",
    "With hoofs and a tail and all that.",
    "Capering\nabout like a ham actor.",
    "Of course I often have a master criminal in\nmy stories  people like it  but really he gets harder and harder to\ndo.",
    "So long as one doesnt know who he is I can keep him\nimpressive.",
    "But when it all comes out he seems somehow so\ninadequate.",
    "A kind of anticlimax.",
    "Its much easier if you just have a\nbank manager whos embezzled the funds or a husband who wants\nto get rid of his wife and marry the childrens governess.",
    "So much\nmore natural  if you know what I mean.",
    "Everyone laughed and Mrs Oliver said apologetically\n\nI know I havent put it very well  but you do see what I mean\n\nWe all said that we knew exactly what she meant.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nIt was after four oclock when we left Priors Court.",

    "Youre lucky to have such a neighbour.",
    "Dont we know it said Rhoda.",
    "Most of the people down here are\nnice enough  but definitely on the dull side.",
    "Mr Venables is\npositively exotic by comparison.",
    "How did he make his money asked Mrs Oliver.",
    "Or has he always\nhad it\n\nDespard remarked wryly that nobody nowadays could boast of\nsuch a thing as a large inherited income.",
    "Death duties and taxation\nhad seen to that.",
    "Someone told me he added that he started life as a stevedore\nbut it seems most unlikely.",
    "He never talks about his boyhood or his\nfamily.",
    "He turned towards Mrs Oliver.",
    "A Mystery Man for you.",
    "Mrs Oliver said that people were always offering her things she\ndidnt want \n\nThe Pale Horse was a halftimbered building genuine halftimbering not faked.",

    "Here you are at last she said in a hearty bass voice.",
    "Thought\nyoud all got lost.",
    "Behind her tweedclad shoulder I became aware of a face peering\nout from the shadows of the dark hall.",
    "A queer rather formless\nface like something made in putty by a child who had strayed in to\nplay in a sculptors studio.",
    "It was the kind of face I thought that you\nsometimes see amongst a crowd in an Italian or Flemish primitive\npainting.",
    "Rhoda introduced us and explained that we had been lunching with\nMr Venables at Priors Court.",
    "Ah said Miss Grey.",
    "That explains it Fleshpots.",

    "She peered at the inn sign.",
    "A lot more would\ncome up.",
    "The horse may even have a rider.",
    "I joined her to stare into the picture.",
    "It was a crude painting with\nlittle merit except the doubtful one of old age and dirt.",
    "The pale\n\n\ffigure of a stallion gleamed against a dark indeterminate\nbackground.",
    "Hi Sybil cried Thyrza.",
    "The visitors are crabbing our Horse\ndamn their impertinence\n\nMiss Sybil Stamfordis came through a door to join us.",

    "She wore a plain\ndark green overall.",
    "The impression of a head made crudely from\nPlasticine by a child was borne out on closer inspection.",
    "It was a\n\n\fwitless primitive face but I could not imagine why I had thought it\nsinister.",
    "Suddenly I felt angry with myself.",
    "All this nonsense about a\nconverted inn and three middleaged women\n\nThank you Bella said Thyrza.",
    "Got all you want\n\nIt came out almost as a mumble.",
    "Yes thanks.",
    "Bella withdrew to the door.",
    "She had looked at nobody but just\nbefore she went out she raised her eyes and took a speedy glance\nat me.",
    "There was something in that look that startled me  though it\nwas difficult to describe why.",

    "I told then as simply as I could with an\neconomy of words of the murder of Father Gorman and of the\ncasual mention in the night club of the Pale Horse.",
    "Then I took from\nmy pocket the list of names I had copied from the paper Dr\nCorrigan had shown me.",
    "Mrs Dane Calthrop looked down at it frowning.",
    "I see she said.",
    "And these people What have they all in\ncommon\n\nWere not sure.",
    "It might be blackmail  or dope \n\nNonsense said Mrs Dane Calthrop.",
    "Thats not whats worrying\nyou.",
    "What you really believe is  that theyre all dead\n\nI gave a deep sigh.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "Thats what I believe.",
    "But I dont really know that that\nis so.",
    "Three of them are dead.",
    "Minnie HeskethDubois Thomasina\nTuckerton Mary Delafontaine.",
    "All three died in their beds from\nnatural causes.",
    "Which is what Thyrza Grey claims would happen.",
    "You mean she claims she made it happen\n\nNo no.",
    "She wasnt speaking of any actual people.",
    "She was expounding what she believes to be a scientific\npossibility.",
    "Which appears on the face of it to be nonsense said Mrs Dane\nCalthrop thoughtfully.",
    "I know.",
    "I would just have been polite about it and laughed to\nmyself if it hadnt been for that curious mention of the Pale Horse.",
    "Yes said Mrs Dane Calthrop musingly.",
    "The Pale Horse.",
    "Thats\nsuggestive.",
    "She was silent a moment.",
    "Then she raised her head.",
    "Its bad she said.",
    "Its very bad.",
    "Whatever is behind it its got to\nbe stopped.",
    "But you know that.",
    "Well yes... but what can one do\n\nThat youll have to find out.",
    "But theres no time to be lost.",
    "Mrs\nDane Calthrop rose to her feet a whirlwind of activity.",
    "You must\nget down to it  at once.",
    "She considered.",
    "Havent you got some\nfriend who could help you\n\nI thought.",
    "Jim Corrigan A busy man with little time and already\nprobably doing all he could.",

    "Youve thought of someone Good.",
    "Mrs Dane Calthrop was brisk and businesslike.",
    "Ill keep an eye on the three witches.",
    "I still feel that they are somehow  not really the answer.",
    "Its like when the Stamfordis\nwoman dishes out a lot of idiocy about Egyptian mysteries and\n\n\fprophecies from the Pyramid texts.",
    "All she says is plain balderdash\nbut there are pyramids and texts and temple mysteries.",
    "I cant help\nfeeling that Thyrza Grey has got hold of something found out about\nit or heard it talked about and is using it in a kind of wild\nhodgepodge to boost her own importance and control of occult\npowers.",
    "People are so proud of wickedness.",
    "Odd isnt it that\npeople who are good are never proud of it Thats where Christian\nhumility comes in I suppose.",
    "They dont even know they are good.",
    "She was silent for a moment and then said\n\nWhat we really need is a link of some kind.",
    "A link between one of\nthese names and the Pale Horse.",
    "Something tangible.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nDetectiveInspector Lejeune heard the wellknown tune Father\nOFlynn being whistled outside in the passage and raised his head\nas Dr Corrigan came in.",
    "Sorry to disoblige everybody said Corrigan but the driver of\nthat Jaguar hadnt any alcohol in him at all.",
    "What P.C.",
    "Ellis smelled\non his breath must have been Elliss imagination or halitosis.",
    "But Lejeune at the moment was uninterested in the daily run of\nmotorists offences.",
    "Come and take a look at this he said.",
    "Corrigan took the letter handed to him.",
    "It was written in a small neat\nscript.",
    "The heading was Everest Glendower Close Bournemouth.",
    "Dear Inspector Lejeune\n\nYou may remember that you asked me to get in touch with you if I\nshould happen to see the man who was following Father Gorman on\nthe night that he was killed.",
    "I kept a good lookout in the\nneighbourhood of my establishment but never caught a glimpse of\nhim again.",
    "Yesterday however I attended a church f\u043ate in a village about\ntwenty miles from here.",
    "I was attracted by the fact that Mrs Oliver\nthe\n\nwellknown\n\ndetective\n\nwriter\n\nwas\n\ngoing\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nthere\n\nautographing her own books.",
    "I am a great reader of detective\nstories and I was quite curious to see the lady.",
    "What I did see to my great surprise was the man I described to you\nas having passed my shop the night Father Gorman was killed.",
    "Since then it would seem he must have met with an accident as\non this occasion he was propelling himself in a wheelchair.",
    "I made\nsome discreet inquiries as to who he might be and it seems he is a\nlocal resident of the name of Venables.",
    "His place of residence is\nPriors Court Much Deeping.",
    "He is said to be a man of considerable\nmeans.",
    "Hoping these details may be of some service to you\n\n\fYours truly\n\nZachariah Osborne\n\nWell said Lejeune.",
    "Sounds most unlikely said Corrigan dampingly.",
    "On the face of it perhaps.",
    "But Im not so sure.",
    "This Osborne fellow  he couldnt really have seen anyones face\nvery clearly on a foggy night like that.",
    "I expect this is just a chance\nresemblance.",
    "You know what people are.",
    "Ring up all over the\ncountry to say theyve seen a missing person and nine times out of\nten theres no resemblance even to the printed description\n\nOsbornes not like that said Lejeune.",
    "What is he like\n\nHes a respectable dapper little chemist oldfashioned quite a\ncharacter and a great observer of persons.",
    "One of the dreams of\nhis life is to be able to come forward and identify a wife poisoner\nwho has purchased arsenic at his shop.",
    "Corrigan laughed.",
    "In that case this is clearly an example of wishful thinking.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "Corrigan looked at him curiously.",
    "So you think there may be something in it What are you going to\ndo about it\n\nThere will be no harm in any case in making a few discreet\ninquiries about this Mr Venables of  he referred to the letter  of\nPriors Court Much Deeping.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nWhat exciting things happen in the country said Hermia lightly.",
    "We had just finished dinner.",
    "A pot of black coffee was in front of us.",
    "I looked at her.",
    "The words were not quite what I had expected.",
    "I had\nspent the last quarter of an hour in telling her my story.",
    "She had\nlistened intelligently and with interest.",
    "But her response was not at\nall what I had expected.",
    "The tone of her voice was indulgent  she\nseemed neither shocked nor stirred.",
    "People who say that the country is dull and the towns full of\nexcitement dont know what they are talking about she went on.",

    "Why dont you\ntry your hand\n\nI dont think you really understand what Ive been telling you\nHermia.",
    "But I do Mark I think its all tremendously interesting.",
    "Its a page\nout of history all the lingering forgotten lore of the Middle Ages.",
    "Im not interested historically I said irritably.",
    "Im interested in\nthe facts.",
    "In a list of names on a sheet of paper.",
    "I know what has\nhappened to some of those people.",
    "Whats going to happen or has\nhappened to the rest\n\nArent you letting yourself get rather carried away\n\nNo I said obstinately.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "I think the menace is real.",
    "And Im not alone in thinking so.",
    "The vicars wife agrees with me.",
    "Oh the vicars wife Hermias voice was scornful.",
    "No not the vicars wife like that Shes a very unusual woman.",
    "This whole thing is real Hermia.",
    "Hermia shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Perhaps.",

    "Good everyday sensible light the electric\nlight bulb firmly fixed in its socket illuminating all the dark corners.",
    "Nothing there  nothing at all  just the everyday objects you always\nfind in a room.",
    "But yet  but yet  Hermias light clear as it might\nmake things seem was after all an artificial light.",

    "I want to look into it all Hermia.",
    "Get to the bottom of whats going\non.",
    "I agree.",
    "I think you should.",

    "Thats it.",

    "I left a message however that Id be in between six and\nseven if he could come for a drink.",
    "He was a busy man I knew and\nI doubted if he would be able to come at such a short notice but he\nturned up all right at about ten minutes to seven.",
    "While I was getting\nhim a whisky he wandered round looking at my pictures and books.",
    "He remarked finally that he wouldnt have minded being a Mogul\nemperor himself instead of a hardpressed overworked police\nsurgeon.",

    "At least I\nescape that.",
    "Youre not married then\n\nNo fear.",
    "And no more are you I should say from the comfortable\nmess in which you live.",
    "A wife would tidy all that up in next to no\ntime.",

    "What was that  oh of course.",
    "The Father Gorman business.",
    "Yes  But first does the phrase The Pale Horse mean anything to\nyou\n\nThe Pale horse... the Pale horse... no I dont think so  why\n\nBecause I think its possible that it might have a connection with\nthat list of names you showed me.",
    "Ive been down in the country\nwith friends at a place called Much Deeping and they took me to\nan old pub or what was once a pub called the Pale Horse.",
    "Wait a bit Much Deeping Much Deeping.",
    "It is anywhere near\nBournemouth\n\nIts about fifteen miles or so from Bournemouth.",
    "I suppose you didnt come across anyone called Venables down\nthere\n\nCertainly I did.",
    "You did Corrigan sat up in some excitement.",
    "You certainly have\na knack of going places What is he like\n\nHes a most remarkable man.",
    "He is is he Remarkable in what way\n\nPrincipally in the force of his personality.",
    "Although hes completely\ncrippled by polio \n\nCorrigan interrupted me sharply.",
    "What\n\nHe had polio some years ago.",
    "Hes paralyzed from the waist\ndown.",
    "Corrigan threw himself back in his chair with a look of disgust.",
    "That tears it I thought it was too good to be true.",
    "I dont understand what you mean\n\nCorrigan said Youll have to meet the D.D.I.",
    "Divisional DetectiveInspector Lejeune.",
    "Hell be interested in what you have to say.",
    "When Gorman was killed Lejeune asked for information from\nanyone who had seen him in the street that night.",
    "Most of the\nanswers were useless as is usual.",
    "But there was a pharmacist\nname of Osborne who has a shop in those parts.",
    "He reported\nhaving seen Gorman pass his place that night and he also saw a\nman who followed close after him  naturally he didnt think anything\nof it at that time.",
    "But he managed to describe this chap pretty\nclosely  seemed quite sure hed know him again.",
    "Well a couple of\ndays ago Lejeune got a letter from Osborne.",
    "Hes retired and living\n\n\fin Bournemouth.",
    "Hed been over to some local f\u043ate and he said hed\nseen the man in question there.",
    "He was at the f\u043ate in a wheelchair.",
    "Osborne asked who he was and was told his name was Venables.",
    "He looked at me questioningly.",
    "I nodded.",
    "Quite right I said.",
    "It was Venables.",
    "He was at the f\u043ate.",
    "But he\ncouldnt have been the man who was walking along a street in\nPaddington following Father Gorman.",
    "Its physically impossible.",
    "Osborne made a mistake.",
    "He described him very meticulously.",
    "Height about six feet a\nprominent beaked nose and a noticeable Adams apple.",
    "Correct\n\nYes.",
    "It fits Venables.",
    "But all the same \n\nI know.",
    "Mr Osborne isnt necessarily as good as he thinks he is at\nrecognising people.",
    "Clearly he was misled by the coincidence of a\nchance resemblance.",
    "But its disturbing to have you come along\nshooting your mouth off about that very district  talking about some\npale horse or other.",
    "What is this pale horse Lets have your story.",
    "You wont believe it I warned him.",
    "I dont really believe it\nmyself.",
    "Come on.",
    "Lets have it.",
    "I told him of my conversation with Thyrza Grey.",
    "His reaction was\nimmediate.",

    "Sacrifices I suppose A medium the local witch and a middleaged\ncountry spinster who can send out a death ray guaranteed lethal.",
    "Its mad man absolutely mad\n\nYes its mad I said heavily.",
    "Oh stop agreeing with me Mark.",
    "You make me feel theres\nsomething in it when you do that.",
    "You believe theres something in\nit dont you\n\nLet me ask you a question first.",
    "This stuff about everybody having\na secret urge or wish for death.",
    "Is there any scientific truth in that\n\nCorrigan hesitated for a moment.",
    "Then he said\n\nIm not a psychiatrist.",
    "Strictly between you and me I think half\nthese fellows are slightly barmy themselves.",
    "Theyre punch drunk\non theories.",
    "And they go much too far.",
    "I can tell you that the police\narent at all fond of the expert medical witness whos always being\ncalled in for the defence to explain away a mans having killed some\nhelpless old woman for the money in the till.",
    "You prefer your glandular theory\n\nHe grinned.",
    "All right.",
    "All right.",
    "Im a theorist too.",
    "Admttted.",
    "But theres a good\nphysical reason behind my theory  if I can ever get at it.",
    "But all this\nsubconscious stuff Pah\n\nYou dont believe in it\n\nOf course I believe in it.",
    "But these chaps take it much too far.",
    "The\nunconscious death wish and all that theres something in it of\ncourse but not nearly so much as they make out.",
    "But there is such a thing I persisted.",
    "Youd better go and buy yourself a book on psychology and read\nall about it.",
    "Thyrza Grey claims that she knows all there is to know.",
    "Thyrza Grey he snorted.",
    "What does a halfbaked spinster in a\ncountry village know about mental psychology\n\nShe says she knows a lot.",
    "As I said before balderdash\n\nThat I remarked is what people have always said about any\ndiscovery that doesnt accord with recognized ideas.",
    "Iron ships\nBalderdash Flyingmachines Balderdash Frogs twitching their\nlegs on railings \n\n\fHe interrupted me.",
    "So youve swallowed all this hook line and sinker\n\nNot at all I said.",
    "I just wanted to know if there is any scientific\nbasis for it.",
    "Corrigan snorted.",
    "Scientific basis my foot\n\nAll right.",
    "I just wanted to know.",
    "Youll be saying next shes the Woman with the Box.",
    "What Woman with a Box\n\nJust one of the wild stories that turn up from time to time  by\nNostradamus out of Mother Shipton.",
    "Some people will swallow\nanything.",
    "You might at least tell me how you are getting on with that list of\nnames.",
    "The boys have been hard at work but these things take time and a\nlot of routine work.",
    "Names without addresses or Christian names\narent easy to trace or identify.",
    "Lets take it from a different angle.",
    "Id be willing to bet you one\nthing.",
    "Within a fairly recent period  say a year to a year and a half \n\n\fevery one of those names has appeared on a death certificate.",

    "Youre right  for what its worth.",
    "Thats the thing they all have in common  death.",
    "Yes but that maynt mean as much as it sounds Mark.",
    "Have you\nany idea how many people die every day in the British Isles And\nsome of those names are quite common  which doesnt help.",
    "Delafontaine I said.",
    "Mary Delafontaine.",
    "Thats not a very\ncommon name is it The funeral was last Tuesday I understand.",
    "He shot me a quick glance.",
    "How do you know that Saw it in the paper I suppose.",
    "I heard it from a friend of hers.",
    "There was nothing fishy about her death.",
    "I can tell you that.",
    "In fact\ntheres been nothing questionable about any of the deaths the\npolice have been investigating.",
    "If they were accidents it might be\nsuspicious.",
    "But the deaths are all perfectly normal deaths.",
    "Pneumonia cerebral hemorrhage tumour on the brain gallstones\none case of polio  nothing in the least suspicious.",
    "I nodded.",
    "Not accident I said.",
    "Not poisoning.",
    "Just plain illnesses leading\nto death.",
    "Just as Thyrza Grey claims.",
    "Are you really suggesting that that woman can cause someone\nshes never seen miles away to catch pneumonia and die of it\n\nIm not suggesting such a thing.",
    "She did.",
    "I think its fantastic and\nId like to think its impossible.",
    "But there are certain curious factors.",
    "Theres the casual mention of a Pale Horse  in connection with the\nremoval of unwanted persons.",
    "There is a place called the Pale\nHorse  and the woman who lives there practically boasts that such\nan operation is possible.",
    "Living in that neighbourhood is a man who\nis recognized very positively as the man who was seen following\nFather Gorman on the night that he was killed  the night when he\nhad been called to a dying woman who was heard to speak of great\nwickedness.",
    "Rather a lot of coincidences dont you think\n\nThe man couldnt have been Venables since according to you\nhes been paralyzed for years.",
    "It isnt possible from the medical point of view that that paralysis\ncould be faked\n\nOf course not.",
    "The limbs would be atrophied.",
    "That certainly seems to settle the question I admitted.",
    "I sighed.",
    "A pity.",
    "If there is a  I dont know quite what to call it  an\norganization that specializes in Removals  Human Venables is the\nkind of brain I can see running it.",
    "The things he has in that house of\n\n\fhis represent a fantastic amount of money.",
    "Where does that money\ncome from\n\nI paused  and then said\n\nAll these people who have died  tidily  in their beds of this that\nand the other  were there people who profited by their deaths\n\nSomeone always profits by a death  in greater or lesser degree.",
    "There were no notably suspicious circumstances if that is what you\nmean\n\nIt isnt quite.",
    "Lady HeskethDubois as you probably know left about fifty\nthousand net.",

    "Several people in high places must\nbe greatly relieved that he is no more.",
    "What youre saying in effect is  that all these deaths were\nconvenient deaths.",
    "What about Corrigan\n\nCorrigan grinned.",
    "Corrigan is a common name.",
    "Quite a lot of Corrigans have died but not to the particular advantage of anyone in particular so far as\nwe can learn.",

    "On recognizing his visitor an additional\nflush of pleasure rose to his already flushed face.",
    "Mr Osborne in the\ncountry was looking very much the same as Mr Osborne in his shop\nin London.",
    "He wore stout country shoes and was in his shirt\n\n\fsleeves but even this deshabille detracted little from the dapper\nneatness of his appearance.",

    "I attend local sales\nwhenever possible.",
    "There is good stuff to be picked up that way at\na quarter of the cost one would have to pay in a shop.",
    "Now what\ncan I offer you A glass of sherry Beer A cup of tea I could have\nthe kettle on in a jiffy\n\nLejeune expressed a preference for beer.",

    "Ah I confess I am disappointed.",
    "Though really there is I realise\nno reason to suppose that a gentleman proceeding in the same\ndirection as Father Gorman should necessarily be his murderer.",
    "That was really too much to hope for.",
    "And this Mr Venables is welltodo and much respected locally I understand moving in the best\nsocial circles.",
    "The point is said Lejeune that it could not have been Mr\nVenables that you saw on that particular evening.",
    "Mr Osborne sat up sharply.",
    "Oh but it was.",
    "I have absolutely no doubt in my own mind.",
    "I am\nnever mistaken about a face.",
    "Im afraid you must have been this time said Lejeune gently.",
    "You\nsee Mr Venables is a victim of polio.",
    "For over three years he has\nbeen paralyzed from the waist down and is unable to use his legs.",
    "Polio ejaculated Mr Osborne.",
    "Oh dear dear... that does seem to\nsettle the matter.",
    "And yet  Youll excuse me Inspector Lejeune.",
    "I\nhope you wont take offence.",
    "But that really is so I mean you have\ndefinite medical evidence as to that\n\nYes Mr Osborne.",
    "We have.",
    "Mr Venables is a patient of Sir William\nDugdale of Harley Street a most eminent member of the medical\nprofession.",
    "Of course of course.",
    "F.R.C.P.",
    "A very wellknown name Oh dear I\nseem to have fallen down badly.",
    "I was so very sure.",
    "And to trouble\nyou for nothing.",
    "You mustnt take it like that said Lejeune quickly.",
    "Your\ninformation is still very valuable.",
    "It is clear that the man you saw\nmust bear a very close resemblance to Mr Venables  and since Mr\nVenables is a man of distinctly unusual appearance that is\nextremely valuable knowledge to have.",
    "There cannot be many\npersons answering to that description.",
    "True true.",
    "Mr Osborne cheered up a little.",
    "A man of the criminal\nclasses resembling Mr Venables in appearance.",
    "There certainly\ncannot be many such.",
    "In the files at Scotland Yard \n\nHe looked hopefully at the inspector.",
    "It may not be quite so simple as that said Lejeune slowly.",
    "The\nman may not have a record.",
    "And in any case as you said just now\nthere is as yet no reason to assume that this particular man had\nanything to do with the attack on Father Gorman.",
    "Mr Osborne looked depressed again.",
    "You must forgive me.",
    "Wishful thinking.",
    "I am afraid on my part...",
    "I\nshould so like to have been able to give evidence at a murder trial...\nand they would not have been able to shake me I assure you of\nthat.",
    "Oh no I should have stuck to my guns\n\nLejeune was silent considering his host thoughtfully.",
    "Mr Osborne\nresponded to the silent scrutiny.",
    "Yes\n\nMr Osborne why would you have stuck to your guns as you put\nit\n\nMr Osborne looked astonished.",
    "Because I am so certain  oh  oh yes I see what you mean.",
    "The\nman was not the man.",
    "So I have no business to feel certain.",
    "And yet\nI do.",
    "Lejeune leaned forward.",
    "You may have wondered why I have come\nto see you today.",
    "Having received medical evidence that the man\nseen by you could not have been Mr Venables why am I here\n\n\fQuite.",
    "Quite.",
    "Well then Inspector Lejeune why did you come\n\nI came said Lejeune because the very positiveness of your\nidentification impressed me.",
    "I wanted to know on what grounds\nyour certainty was based.",
    "It was a foggy night remember.",
    "I have\nbeen to your shop.",
    "I have stood where you stood in your doorway\nand looked across the street.",
    "On a foggy night it seemed to me that\na figure at that distance would be very insubstantial that it would\nbe almost impossible to distinguish features clearly.",
    "Up to a point of course you are quite right.",
    "Fog was setting in.",
    "But\nit came if you understand me in patches.",
    "It cleared for a short\nspace every now and then.",
    "It did so at the moment that I saw Father\nGorman walking fast along the opposite pavement.",
    "That is why I\nsaw him and the man who followed shortly after him so clearly.",
    "Moreover just when the second man was abreast of me he flicked\non a lighter to relight his cigarette.",
    "His profile at that moment was\nvery clear  the nose the chin the pronounced Adams apple.",
    "Thats a strikinglooking man I thought.",
    "Ive never seen him about\nbefore.",
    "If hed ever been into my shop Id have remembered him I\nthought.",
    "So you see \n\nMr Osborne broke off.",
    "Yes I see said Lejeune thoughtfully.",
    "A brother suggested Mr Osborne hopefully.",
    "A twin brother\nperhaps Now that would be a solution.",
    "The identical twin solution Lejeune smiled and shook his head.",
    "So very convenient in fiction.",
    "But in real life he shook his head\nit doesnt happen you know.",
    "It really doesnt happen.",
    "No... no I suppose not.",
    "But possibly an ordinary brother.",
    "A close\nfamily resemblance  Mr Osborne looked wistful.",
    "As far as we can ascertain Lejeune spoke carefully Mr\nVenables has not got a brother.",
    "As far as you can ascertain Mr Osborne repeated the words.",
    "Though of British nationality he was born abroad his parents only\nbrought him to England when he was eleven years old.",
    "You dont know very much about him really then About his family\nI mean\n\nNo said Lejeune thoughtfully.",
    "It isnt easy to find out very much\nabout Mr Venables  without that is to say going and asking him\nand weve no grounds for doing that.",
    "He spoke deliberately.",
    "There were ways of finding out things\nwithout going and asking but he had no intention of telling Mr\nOsborne so.",
    "So if it wasnt for the medical evidence he said getting to his feet\nyoud be sure about the identification\n\n\fOh yes said Mr Osborne following suit.",
    "Its quite a hobby of\nmine you know memorizing faces.",
    "He chuckled.",
    "Many a\ncustomer Ive surprised that way.",
    "Hows the asthma Id say to\nsomeone and shed look quite surprised.",
    "You came in last March\nId say with a prescription.",
    "One of Dr Hargreavess.",
    "And wouldnt\nshe look surprised Did me a lot of good in business.",
    "It pleases\npeople to be remembered though I wasnt as good with names as\nwith faces.",
    "I started making a hobby of the thing quite young.",
    "If\nRoyalty can do it I used to say to myself you can do it Zachariah\nOsborne After a while it becomes automatic.",
    "You hardly have to\nmake an effort.",
    "Lejeune sighed.",
    "Id like to have a witness like you in the box he said.",
    "Identification is always a tricky business.",
    "Most people cant tell\nyou anything at all.",
    "Theyll say things like Oh tallish I think.",
    "Fair\nhaired  well not very fair sort of middling.",
    "Ordinary sort of face.",
    "Eyes blue  or grey  or perhaps brown.",
    "Grey mackintosh  or it may\nhave been dark blue.",
    "Mr Osborne laughed.",
    "Not much good to you that sort of thing.",
    "Frankly a witness like you would be a godsend\n\nMr Osborne looked pleased.",
    "Its a gift he said modestly.",
    "But mind you Ive cultivated my gift.",
    "You know the game they play at childrens parties  a lot of objects\nbrought in on a tray and a few minutes given to memorize them.",
    "I\ncan score a hundred percent every time.",
    "Quite surprises people.",
    "How wonderful they say.",
    "Its not wonderful.",
    "Its a knack.",
    "Comes\nwith practice.",
    "He chuckled.",
    "Im not a bad conjurer either.",
    "I do a\nbit to amuse the kiddies at Christmas time.",
    "Excuse me Mr Lejeune\nwhat have you got in your breast pocket\n\nHe leaned forward and extracted a small ashtray.",
    "Tut tut sir and you in the police force\n\nHe laughed heartily and Lejeune laughed with him.",
    "Then Mr\nOsborne sighed.",
    "Its a nice little place Ive got here sir.",
    "The neighbours seem\npleasant and friendly.",
    "Its the life Ive been looking forward to for\nyears but Ill admit to you Mr Lejeune that I miss the interest of my\nown business.",
    "Always someone coming in and out.",
    "Types you\nknow lots of types to study.",
    "Ive looked forward to having my little\nbit of garden and Ive got quite a lot of interests.",
    "Butterflies as I\ntold you and a bit of bird watching now and again.",
    "I didnt realise\nthat Id miss what I might call the human element so much.",
    "Id looked forward to going abroad in a small way.",
    "Well Ive taken\none weekend trip to France.",
    "Quite nice I must say  but I felt very\nstrongly that Englands really good enough for me.",
    "I didnt care for\nthe foreign cooking for one thing.",
    "They havent the least idea as\nfar as I can see how to do eggs and bacon.",
    "He sighed again.",
    "Just shows you what human nature is.",
    "Looked forward no end to\nretiring I did.",
    "And now do you know Ive actually played with the\nidea of buying a small share in a pharmaceutical business here in\nBournemouth  just enough to give me an interest no need to be\ntied to the shop all the time.",
    "But Id feel in the middle of things\nagain.",
    "It will be the same with you I expect.",
    "Youll make plans\nahead but when the time comes youll miss the excitement of your\npresent life.",
    "Lejeune smiled.",
    "A policemans life is not such a romantically exciting one as you\nthink Mr Osborne.",
    "Youve got the amateurs view of crime.",
    "Most of\nit is dull routine.",
    "Were not always chasing down criminals and\nfollowing up mysterious clues.",
    "It can be quite a dull business\nreally.",
    "Mr Osborne looked unconvinced.",
    "You know best he said.",
    "Goodbye Mr Lejeune and Im sorry\nindeed that I havent been able to help you.",
    "If there was anything any time \n\nIll let you know Lejeune promised him.",
    "That day at the f\u043ate it seemed such a chance Osborne murmured\nsadly.",
    "I know.",
    "A pity the medical evidence is so definite but one cant get\nover that sort of thing can one\n\nWell  Mr Osborne let the word linger but Lejeune did not notice\nit.",
    "He strode away briskly.",
    "Mr Osborne stood by the gate looking\nafter him.",
    "Medical evidence he said.",
    "Doctors indeed If he knew half what I\nknow about doctors  innocents thats what they are Doctors\nindeed\n\nChapter 11\n\nFirst Hermia.",
    "Now Corrigan.",
    "All right then I was making a fool of myself I was accepting\nbalderdash as solid truth.",
    "I had been hypnotized by that phony\nwoman Thyrza Grey into accepting a farrago of nonsense.",
    "I was a\ncredulous superstitious ass.",
    "I decided to forget the whole damned business.",
    "What was it to do\nwith me anyway\n\nThrough the mist of disillusionment I heard the echoes of Mrs Dane\nCalthrops urgent tones.",
    "Youve got to do something\n\n\fAll very well  to say things like that.",
    "You need someone to help you...",
    "I had needed Hermia.",
    "I had needed Corrigan.",
    "But neither of them\nwould play.",
    "There was no one else.",
    "Unless \n\nI sat  considering the idea.",
    "On an impulse I went to the telephone and rang Mrs Oliver.",
    "Hallo.",
    "Mark Easterbrook here.",
    "Yes\n\nCan you tell me the name of that girl who was staying in the house\nfor the f\u043ate\n\nI expect so.",
    "Let me see... yes of course Ginger.",
    "That was her\nname.",
    "I know that.",
    "But her other name.",
    "What other name\n\nI doubt if she was christened Ginger.",
    "And she must have a\nsurname.",
    "Well of course.",
    "But Ive no idea what it is.",
    "One never seems to\nhear any surnames nowadays.",
    "Its the first time Id ever met her.",
    "There was a slight pause and then Mrs Oliver said Youll have to\nring up Rhoda and ask her.",
    "I didnt like that idea.",
    "Somehow I felt shy about it.",
    "Oh I cant do that I said.",
    "Its perfectly simple said Mrs Oliver encouragingly.",
    "Just say\nyouve lost her address and cant remember her name and youd\npromised to send her one of your books or the name of a shop that\nsells cheap caviare or to return a handkerchief which she lent you\nwhen your nose bled one day or the address of a rich friend who\nwants a picture restored.",
    "Any of those do I can think of lots more if\nyoud like.",
    "One of those will do beautifully I assured her.",
    "I rang off dialed\n100 and presently was speaking to Rhoda.",
    "Ginger said Rhoda.",
    "Oh she lives in a mews.",
    "Calgary Place.",
    "Fortyfive.",
    "Wait a minute.",
    "Ill give you her telephone number.",
    "She\nwent away and returned a minute later.",
    "Its Capricorn 35987.",
    "Got\nit\n\nYes thanks.",
    "But I havent got her name.",
    "I never heard it.",
    "Her name Oh her surname you mean.",
    "Corrigan.",
    "Katherine\nCorrigan.",
    "What did you say\n\n\fNothing.",
    "Thanks Rhoda.",
    "It seemed to me an odd coincidence.",
    "Corrigan.",
    "Two Corrigans.",
    "Perhaps it was an omen.",
    "I dialed Capricorn 35987.",
    "II\n\nGinger sat opposite me at a table in the White Cockatoo where we\nhad met for a drink.",
    "She looked refreshingly the same as she had\nlooked at Much Deeping  a tousled mop of red hair an engagingly\nfreckled face and alert green eyes.",
    "She was wearing her London\nartistic livery of skintight pants a Sloppy Joe jersey and black\nwoollen stockings  but otherwise she was the same Ginger.",
    "I liked\nher very much.",
    "Ive had to do a lot of work to track you down I said.",
    "Your\nsurname and your address and your telephone number  all\nunknown.",
    "Ive got a problem.",
    "Thats what my daily always says.",
    "It usually means that I have to\nbuy her a new saucepan scourer or a carpet brush or something\ndull.",
    "You wont have to buy anything I assured her.",
    "Then I told her.",
    "It didnt take quite so long as the story I had told to\nHermia because she was already familiar with the Pale Horse and\nits occupants.",
    "I averted my eyes from her as I finished the tale.",
    "I\ndidnt want to see her reaction.",
    "I didnt want to see indulgent\namusement or stark incredulity.",
    "The whole thing sounded more\nidiotic than ever.",
    "No one except Mrs Dane Calthrop could possibly\nfeel about it as I felt.",
    "I drew patterns on the plastic tabletop with a\nstray fork.",
    "Gingers voice came briskly.",
    "Thats all is it\n\nThats all I admitted.",
    "What are you going to do about it\n\nYou think  I should do something about it\n\nWell of course Someones got to do something You cant have an\norganization going about bumping people off and not do anything.",
    "But what can I do\n\nI could have fallen on her neck and hugged her.",
    "She was sipping Pernod and frowning.",
    "Warmth spread over me.",
    "I\nwas no longer alone.",
    "Presently she said musingly\n\n\fYoull have to find out what it all means.",
    "I agree.",
    "But how\n\nThere seem to be one or two leads.",
    "Perhaps I can help.",
    "Would you But theres your job.",
    "Plenty could be done out of office hours.",
    "She frowned again as\nshe thought.",
    "That girl she said at last.",
    "The one at supper after the Old Vic.",
    "Poppy or something.",
    "She knows about it  she must  to say what\nshe did.",
    "Yes but she got frightened and sheered off when I tried to ask her\nquestions.",
    "She was scared.",
    "She definitely wouldnt talk.",
    "Thats where I can help said Ginger confidently.",
    "Shed tell me\nthings she wouldnt tell you.",
    "Can you arrange for us to meet Your\nfriend and her and you and me A show or dinner or something\nThen she looked doubtful.",
    "Or is that too expensive\n\nI assured her that I could support the expense.",
    "As for you  Ginger thought a minute.",
    "I believe she said slowly\nthat your best bet would be the Thomasina Tuckerton angle.",
    "But how Shes dead.",
    "And somebody wanted her dead if your ideas are correct And\narranged it with the Pale Horse.",
    "There seem two possibilities.",
    "The\nstepmother or else the girl she had the fight with at Luigis and\nwhose young man she had pinched.",
    "She was going to marry him\nperhaps.",
    "That wouldnt suit the stepmothers book  or the girls if\nshe was crazy enough about the young man.",
    "Either of them might\nhave gone to the Pale Horse.",
    "We might get a lead there.",
    "What was\nthe girls name or dont you know\n\nI think it was Lou.",
    "Ash blonde dank hair medium height rather bosomy\n\nI agreed with the description.",
    "I think Ive met her about.",
    "Lou Ellis.",
    "Shes got a bit of money\nherself.",
    "She didnt look like it.",
    "They dont  but she has all right.",
    "Anyway she could afford to pay\nthe Pale Horses fees.",
    "They dont do it for nothing I suppose.",
    "One would hardly imagine so.",
    "Youll have to tackle the stepmother.",
    "Its more up your street than\nmine.",
    "Go and see her \n\nI dont know where she lives or anything.",
    "Luigi knows something about Tommys home.",
    "Hell know what\ncounty she lived in I should imagine.",
    "A few books of reference\nought to do the rest.",
    "But what idiots we are We saw the notice in\nThe Times of her death.",
    "Youve only got to go and look in their files.",
    "Ill have to have a pretext for tackling the stepmother I said\nthoughtfully.",
    "Ginger said that that would be easy.",
    "Youre someone you see she pointed out.",
    "A historian and you\nlecture and youve got letters after your name.",
    "Mrs Tuckerton will\nbe impressed and probably tickled to death to see you.",
    "And the pretext\n\nSome feature of interest about her house suggested Ginger\nvaguely.",
    "Sure to have something if its an old one.",
    "Nothing to do with my period I objected.",
    "She wont know that said Ginger.",
    "People always think that\nanything over a hundred years old must interest a historian or an\narcheologist.",
    "Or how about a picture There must be some old\npictures of some kind.",
    "Anyway you make an appointment and you\narrive and you butter her up and be charming and then you say you\nonce met her daughter  her stepdaughter  and say how sad etc...\nAnd then bring in quite suddenly a reference to the Pale Horse.",
    "Be a little sinister if you like.",
    "And then\n\nAnd then you observe the reaction.",
    "If you mention the Pale Horse\nout of the blue and she has a guilty conscience I defy anyone not\nto show some sign.",
    "And if she does  what next\n\nThe important thing is that well know were on the right track.",
    "Once were sure we can go full steam ahead.",
    "She added thoughtfully\n\nTheres something else.",
    "Why do you think the Grey woman told you\nall she did tell you Why was she so forthcoming\n\nThe commonsense answer is because shes potty.",
    "I dont mean that.",
    "I mean  why you You in particular I just\nwondered if there might be some kind of tie up\n\nTie up with what\n\nWait just a moment  while I get my ideas in order.",
    "I waited.",
    "Ginger nodded twice emphatically and then spoke.",
    "Supposing  just supposing  it went like this.",
    "The Poppy girl knows\nall about the Pale Horse in a vague kind of way  not through\n\n\fpersonal knowledge but by hearing it talked about.",
    "She sounds the\nsort of girl that wouldnt be noticed much by anyone when they\nwere talking  but shed quite likely take in a lot more than they\nthought she did.",
    "Rather silly people are often like that.",
    "Say she was\noverheard talking to you about it that night and someone ticks her\noff.",
    "Next day you come and ask her questions and shes been\nscared so she wont talk.",
    "But the fact that youve come and asked\nher also gets around.",
    "Now what would be the reason for your\nasking questions Youre not police.",
    "The likely reason would be that\nyoure a possible client.",
    "But surely \n\nIts logical I tell you.",
    "Youve heard rumours of this thing  you want\nto find out about it  for your own purposes.",
    "Presently you appear at\nthe f\u043ate in Much Deeping.",
    "You are brought to the Pale Horse presumably because youve asked to be taken there  and what\nhappens Thyrza Grey goes straight into her sales talk.",
    "I suppose its a possibility.",
    "I considered... Do you think she can\ndo what she claims to do Ginger\n\nPersonally Id be inclined to say of course she cant But odd things\ncan happen.",
    "Especially with things like hypnotism.",
    "Telling someone\nto go and take a bite out of a candle the next afternoon at four\noclock and they do it without having any idea why.",
    "That sort of\nthing.",
    "And electric boxes where you put in a drop of blood and it\ntells you if youre going to have cancer in two years time.",
    "It all\nsounds rather bogus  but perhaps not entirely bogus.",
    "About Thyrza\n I dont think its true  but Im terribly afraid it might be\n\n\fYes I said somberly that explains it very well.",
    "I might put in a bit of work on Lou said Ginger thoughtfully.",
    "I\nknow lots of places where I can run across her.",
    "Luigi might know a\nfew things too.",
    "But the first thing she added is to get in touch with Poppy.",
    "The latter was arranged fairly easily.",
    "David was free three nights\nahead we settled on a musical show and he arrived with Poppy in\ntow.",
    "We went to the Fantasie for supper and I noticed that Ginger\nand Poppy after a prolonged retirement to powder their noses\nreappeared on excellent terms with each other.",
    "No controversial\nsubjects were raised during the party on Gingers instructions.",
    "We\nfinally parted and I drove Ginger home.",
    "Not much to report said she cheerfully.",
    "Ive been on to Lou.",
    "The\nman they quarrelled about was Gene Pleydon by the way.",
    "A nasty\nbit of goods if you ask me.",
    "Very much on the make.",
    "The girls all\nadore him.",
    "He was making quite a play for Lou and then Tommy\ncame along.",
    "Lou says he didnt care for her a bit he was after her\nmoney  but shed probably want to think that.",
    "Anyway he dropped\nLou like a hot coal and she was naturally sore about it.",
    "According to\nher it wasnt much of a row  just a few girlish high spirits.",
    "Girlish high spirits She tugged Tommys hair out by the roots.",
    "Im just telling you what Lou told me.",
    "She seems to have been very forthcoming.",
    "Oh they all like talking about their affairs.",
    "Theyll talk to anyone\nwho will listen.",
    "Anyway Lou has got another boyfriend now another dud Id say but shes already crazy about him.",
    "So it\ndoesnt look to me as though shed been a client of the Pale Horse.",
    "I\nbrought the term up but it didnt register.",
    "I think we can wash her\nout.",
    "Luigi doesnt think there was much in it either.",
    "On the other\nhand he thinks Tommy was serious about Gene.",
    "And Gene was\ngoing for her in a big way.",
    "What have you done about the\nstepmother\n\nShe was abroad.",
    "She comes back tomorrow.",
    "Ive written her a\nletter  or rather I got my secretary to write it asking for an\nappointment.",
    "Good.",
    "Were getting things moving.",
    "I hope everything doesnt\npeter out.",
    "If it gets us anywhere\n\nSomething will said Ginger enthusiastically.",
    "That reminds me.",
    "To go back to the beginning of all this the theory is that Father\nGorman was killed after being called out to a dying woman and that\nhe was murdered because of something she told him or confessed\nto him.",
    "What happened to that woman Did she die And who was\nshe There ought to be some lead there.",
    "She died.",
    "I dont really know much about her.",
    "I think her name was\nDavis.",
    "Well couldnt you find out more\n\nIll see what I can do.",
    "If we could get at her background we might find out how she knew\nwhat she did know.",
    "I see your point.",
    "I got Jim Corrigan on the telephone early the next morning and put\nmy query to him.",
    "Let me see now.",
    "We did get a bit further but not much.",
    "Davis\nwasnt her real name thats why it took a little time to check up on\nher.",
    "Half a moment I jotted down a few things... oh yes here we\nare.",
    "Her real name was Archer and her husband had been a smalltime crook.",
    "She left him and went back to her maiden name.",
    "What sort of a crook was Archer And where is he now\n\nOh very small stuff.",
    "Pinched things from department stores.",
    "Unconsidered trifles here and there.",
    "He had a few convictions.",
    "As\nto where be is now hes dead.",
    "Not much there.",
    "No there isnt.",
    "The firm Mrs Davis was working for at the time of\nher death the C.R.C.",
    "Customers Reactions Classified apparently\ndidnt know anything about her or her background.",
    "I thanked him and rang off.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nThree days later Ginger rang me up.",
    "Ive got something for you she said.",
    "A name and address.",
    "Write\nit down.",
    "I took out my notebook.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "Bradley is the name and the address is Seventyeight Municipal\nSquare Buildings Birmingham.",
    "Well Im damned what is all this\n\nGoodness knows I dont.",
    "I doubt if Poppy does really\n\nPoppy Is this \n\nYes.",
    "Ive been working on Poppy in a big way.",
    "I told you I could get\nsomething out of her if I tried.",
    "Once I got her softened up it was\neasy.",
    "How did you set about it I asked curiously.",
    "Ginger laughed.",
    "Girlstogether stuff.",
    "You wouldnt understand.",
    "The point is that if a\ngirl tells things to another girl it doesnt really count.",
    "She doesnt\nthink it matters.",
    "All in the trade union so to speak\n\nYou could put it like that.",
    "Anyway we lunched together and I\nyapped a bit about my love life  and various obstacles  married\nman with impossible wife  Catholic  wouldnt divorce him  made\nhis life hell.",
    "And how she was an invalid always in pain but not\nlikely to die for years.",
    "Really much better for her if she could die.",
    "Said Id a good mind to try the Pale Horse but I didnt really know\nhow to set about it and would it be terribly expensive And Poppy\nsaid yes she thought it would.",
    "Shed heard they charged the earth.",
    "And I said Well I have expectations.",
    "Which I have you know  a\ngreatuncle  a poppet and Id hate him to die but the fact came in\nuseful.",
    "Perhaps I said theyd take something on account But how\ndid one set about it And then Poppy came across with that name\nand address.",
    "You had to go to him first she said to settle the\nbusiness side.",
    "Its fantastic I said.",
    "It is rather.",
    "We were both silent for a moment.",
    "I said incredulously She told you this quite openly She didnt\nseem scared\n\n\fGinger said impatiently You dont understand.",
    "Telling me didnt\ncount And after all Mark if what we think is true the business has\nto be more or less advertised hasnt it I mean they must want new\nclients all the time.",
    "Were mad to believe anything of the kind.",
    "All right.",
    "Were mad.",
    "Are you going to Birmingham to see Mr\nBradley\n\nYes I said.",
    "Im going to see Mr Bradley.",
    "If he exists.",
    "I hardly believed that he did.",
    "But I was wrong.",
    "Mr Bradley did exist.",
    "Municipal Square Buildings was an enormous honeycomb of\noffices.",
    "Seventyeight was on the third floor.",
    "On the groundglass\ndoor was neatly printed in black C.R.",
    "Bradley Commission Agent.",
    "And below in smaller letters Please Enter.",
    "I entered.",
    "There was a small outer office empty and a door marked Private\nhalf ajar.",
    "A voice from behind it said\n\nCome in please.",
    "The inner office was larger.",
    "It had a desk one or two comfortable\nchairs a telephone a stack of box files and Mr Bradley sitting\nbehind the desk.",
    "He was a small dark man with shrewd dark eyes.",
    "He wore a dark\nbusiness suit and looked the acme of respectability.",
    "Just shut the door will you he said pleasantly.",
    "And sit down.",
    "That chairs quite comfortable.",
    "Cigarette No Well now what can I\ndo for you\n\nI looked at him.",
    "I didnt know how to begin.",
    "I hadnt the least idea\nwhat to say.",
    "It was I think sheer desperation that led me to attack\nwith the phrase I did.",
    "Or it may have been the small beady eyes.",
    "How much I said.",
    "It startled him a little I was glad to note but not in the way that he\nought to have been startled.",
    "He did not assume as I would have\nassumed in his place that someone not quite right in the head had\ncome into his office.",
    "His eyebrows rose.",
    "Well well well he said.",
    "You dont waste much time do you\n\nI held to my line.",
    "Whats the answer\n\nHe shook his head gently in a slightly reproving manner.",
    "Thats not the way to go about things.",
    "We must proceed in the\nproper manner.",
    "I shrugged my shoulders.",
    "As you like.",
    "Whats the proper manner\n\nWe havent introduced ourselves yet have we I dont know your\nname.",
    "At the moment I said I dont really think I feel inclined to tell it to\nyou.",
    "Cautious.",
    "Cautious.",
    "An admirable quality  though not always practicable.",
    "Now who\nsent you to me Whos our mutual friend\n\nAgain I cant tell you.",
    "A friend of mine has a friend who knows a\nfriend of yours.",
    "Mr Bradley nodded his head.",
    "Thats the way a lot of my clients come he said.",
    "Some of the\nproblems are rather  delicate.",
    "You know my profession I\npresume\n\n\fHe had no intention of waiting for my reply.",
    "He hastened to give me\nthe answer.",
    "Turf Commission Agent he said.",
    "Youre interested perhaps in horses\n\nThere was just the faintest pause before the last word.",
    "Im not a racing man I said noncommittally.",
    "There are many aspects of the horse.",
    "Racing hunting hacking.",
    "Its the sporting aspect that interests me.",
    "Betting.",
    "He paused for a\nmoment and then asked casually  almost too casually\n\nAny particular horse you had in mind\n\nI shrugged my shoulders and burnt my boats.",
    "A pale horse...\n\nAh very good excellent.",
    "You yourself if I may say so seem to be\nrather a dark horse.",
    "Ha ha You mustnt be nervous.",
    "There really is\nno need to be nervous.",
    "Thats what you say I said rather rudely.",
    "Mr Bradleys manner\nbecame even more bland and soothing.",
    "I can quite understand your feelings.",
    "But I can assure you that you\nneednt have any anxiety.",
    "Im a lawyer myself  disbarred of\ncourse he added parenthetically in what was really almost an\n\n\fengaging way.",
    "Otherwise I shouldnt be here.",
    "But I can assure you\nthat I know my law.",
    "Everything I recommend is perfectly legal and\naboveboard.",
    "Its just a question of a bet.",
    "A man can bet on anything\nhe pleases whether it will rain tomorrow whether the Russians can\nsend a man to the moon or whether your wifes going to have twins.",
    "You can bet whether Mr B. will die before Christmas or whether\nMrs C. will live to be a hundred.",
    "You back your judgment or your\nintuition or whatever you like to call it.",
    "Its as simple as that.",
    "I felt exactly as though I were being reassured by a surgeon before\nan operation.",
    "Mr Bradleys consultingroom manner was perfect.",
    "I said slowly\n\nI dont really understand this business of the Pale Horse.",
    "And that worries you Yes it worries a lot of people.",
    "More things in\nheaven and earth Horatio and so on and so on.",
    "Frankly I dont\nunderstand it myself.",
    "But it gets results.",
    "It gets results in the most\nmarvellous way.",
    "If you could tell me more about it \n\nI had settled on my role now  cautious eager  but scared.",
    "It was\nobviously an attitude with which Mr Bradley had frequently had to\ncope.",
    "Do you know the place at all\n\nI made a quick decision.",
    "It would be unwise to lie.",
    "I  well  yes  I was with some friends.",
    "They took me there.",
    "Charming old pub.",
    "Full of historical interest.",
    "And theyve done\nwonders in restoring it.",
    "You met her then.",
    "My friend Miss Grey I\nmean\n\nYes  yes of course.",
    "An extraordinary woman.",
    "Isnt she Yes isnt she Youve hit it exactly.",
    "An extraordinary\nwoman.",
    "And with extraordinary powers.",
    "The things she claims Surely quite  well  impossible\n\nExactly.",
    "Thats the whole point.",
    "The things she claims to be able to\nknow and do are impossible Everybody would say so.",
    "In a court of\nlaw for instance \n\nThe black beady eyes were boring into mine.",
    "Mr Bradley repeated\nthe words with designed emphasis.",
    "In a court of law for instance  the whole thing would be ridiculed\nIf that woman stood up and confessed to murder murder by remote\ncontrol or will power or whatever nonsensical name she likes to\nuse that confession couldnt be acted upon Even if her statement\nwas true which of course sensible men like you and I dont believe\nfor one moment it couldnt be admitted legally.",
    "Murder by remote\ncontrol isnt murder in the eyes of the law.",
    "Its just nonsense.",
    "Thats\nthe whole beauty of the thing  as youll appreciate if you think for a\nmoment.",
    "I understood that I was being reassured.",
    "Murder committed by\noccult powers was not murder in an English court of law.",
    "If I were to\nhire a gangster to commit murder with a cosh or a knife I was\ncommitted with him  an accomplice before the fact  I had\nconspired with him.",
    "But if I commissioned Thyrza Grey to use her\nblack arts those black arts were not admissible.",
    "That was what\naccording to Mr Bradley was the beauty of the thing.",
    "All my natural scepticism rose up in protest.",
    "I burst out heatedly.",
    "But damn it all its fantastic I shouted.",
    "I dont believe it.",
    "Its\nimpossible.",
    "I agree with you.",
    "I really do.",
    "Thyrza Grey is an extraordinary\nwoman and she certainly has some extraordinary powers but one\ncant believe all the things she claims for herself.",
    "As you say its too\nfantastic.",
    "In this age one really cant credit that someone can send\nout thought waves or whatever it is either oneself or through a\nmedium sitting in a cottage in England and cause someone to\nsicken and die of a convenient disease out in Capri or somewhere\nlike that.",
    "But that is what she claims\n\nOh yes.",
    "Of course she has powers  she is Scottish and what is\ncalled second sight is a peculiarity of that race.",
    "It really does exist.",
    "What I do believe and believe without a doubt is this he leaned\nforward wagging a forefinger impressively Thyrza Grey does\n\n\fknow  beforehand  when someone is going to die.",
    "Its a gift.",
    "And\nshe has it.",
    "He leaned back studying me.",
    "I waited.",
    "Lets assume a hypothetical case.",
    "Someone yourself or another\nwould like very much to know when  lets say GreatAunt Eliza  is\ngoing to die.",
    "Its useful you must admit to know something like\nthat.",
    "Nothing unkind in it nothing wrong  just a matter of business\nconvenience.",
    "What plans to make Will there be shall we say a\nuseful sum of money coming in by next November If you knew that\ndefinitely you might take up some valuable option.",
    "Death is such a\nchancy matter.",
    "Dear old Eliza might live pepped up by doctors for\nanother ten years.",
    "Youd be delighted of course youre fond of the\ndear old girl but how useful it would be to know.",
    "He paused and then leaned a little farther forward.",
    "Now thats where I come in.",
    "Im a betting man.",
    "Ill bet on anything naturally on my own terms.",
    "You come to me.",
    "Naturally you wouldnt\nwant to bet on the old girls passing out.",
    "That would be repulsive to\nyour finer feelings.",
    "So we put it this way.",
    "You bet me a certain sum\nthat Aunt Eliza will be hale and hearty still next Christmas I bet you\nthat she wont.",
    "The beady eyes were on me watching...",
    "Nothing against that is there Simple.",
    "We have an argument on\nthe subject.",
    "I say Aunt E. is lined up for death you say she isnt.",
    "We\ndraw up a contract and sign it.",
    "I give you a date.",
    "I say that a\n\n\ffortnight either way from that date Auntie E.s funeral service will\nbe read.",
    "You say it wont.",
    "If youre right I pay you.",
    "If youre wrong\nyou  pay me\n\nI looked at him.",
    "I tried to summon up the feelings of a man who\nwants a rich old lady out of the way.",
    "I shifted it to a blackmailer.",
    "Easier to throw oneself into that part.",
    "Some man had been bleeding\nme for years.",
    "I couldnt bear it any longer.",
    "I wanted him dead.",
    "I\nhadnt the nerve to kill him myself but Id give anything  yes\nanything.",
    "I spoke  my voice was hoarse.",
    "I was acting the part with some\nconfidence.",
    "What terms\n\nMr Bradleys manner underwent a rapid change.",
    "It was gay almost\nfacetious.",
    "Thats where we came in isnt it Or rather where you came in ha\nha.",
    "How much you said.",
    "Really quite startled me.",
    "Never heard\nanyone come to the point so soon.",
    "What terms\n\nThat depends.",
    "It depends on several different factors.",
    "Roughly it\ndepends on the amount there is at stake.",
    "In some cases it depends\non the funds available to the client.",
    "An inconvenient husband  or a\nblackmailer or something of that kind  would depend on how much\nmy client could afford to pay.",
    "I dont  let me make that clear  bet\n\n\fwith poor clients except in the kind of case I have just been\noutlining.",
    "In that case it would depend on the amount of Aunt Elizas\nestate.",
    "Terms are by mutual agreement.",
    "We both want something\nout of it dont we The odds however work out usually at five\nhundred to one.",
    "Five hundred to one Thats pretty steep.",
    "My wager is pretty steep.",
    "If Aunt Eliza were pretty well booked for\nthe tomb youd know it already and you wouldnt come to me.",
    "To\nprophesy somebodys death to within two weeks means pretty long\nodds.",
    "Five thousand pounds to one hundred isnt at all out of the\nway.",
    "Supposing you lose\n\nMr Bradley shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Thats just too bad.",
    "I pay up.",
    "And if I lose I pay up.",
    "Supposing I dont\n\nMr Bradley leaned back in his chair.",
    "He half closed his eyes.",
    "I shouldnt advise that he said softly.",
    "I really shouldnt.",
    "Despite the soft tone I felt a faint shiver pass over me.",
    "He had\nuttered no direct menace.",
    "But the menace was there.",
    "I got up.",
    "I said\n\n\fI  I must think it over.",
    "Mr Bradley was once more his pleasant and urbane self.",
    "Certainly think it over.",
    "Never rush into anything.",
    "If you decide to do\nbusiness come back and we will go into the matter fully.",
    "Take your\ntime.",
    "No hurry in the world.",
    "Take your time.",
    "I went out with those words echoing in my ears.",
    "Take your time...\n\nChapter 13\n\nI approached my task of interviewing Mrs Tuckerton with the\nutmost reluctance.",
    "Goaded to it by Ginger I was still far from\nconvinced of its wisdom.",
    "To begin with I felt myself unfitted for the\ntask I had set myself.",
    "I was doubtful of my ability to produce the\nneeded reaction and I was acutely conscious of masquerading\nunder false colours.",
    "Ginger with the almost terrifying efficiency which she was able to\ndisplay when it suited her had briefed me by telephone.",
    "It will be quite simple.",
    "Its a Nash house.",
    "Not the usual style one\nassociates with him.",
    "One of his nearGothic flights of fancy.",
    "And why should I want to see it\n\nYoure considering writing an article or a book on the influences\nthat cause fluctuation of an architects style.",
    "That sort of thing.",
    "Sounds very bogus to me I said.",
    "Nonsense said Ginger robustly.",
    "When you get on to learned\nsubjects or arty ones the most incredible theories are propounded\nand written about in the utmost seriousness by the most unlikely\npeople.",
    "I could quote you chapters of tosh.",
    "Thats why you would really be a much better person to do this\nthan I am.",
    "Thats where you are wrong Ginger told me.",
    "Mrs T. can look you\nup in Whos Who and be properly impressed.",
    "She cant look me up\nthere.",
    "I remained unconvinced though temporarily defeated.",
    "On my return from my incredible interview with Mr Bradley Ginger\nand I had put our heads together.",
    "It was less incredible to her than\nit was to me.",
    "It afforded her indeed a distinct satisfaction.",
    "It puts an end to whether were imagining things or not she\npointed out.",
    "Now we know that an organization does exist for\ngetting unwanted people out of the way.",
    "By supernatural means\n\n\fYoure so hidebound in your thinking.",
    "Its all that wispiness and the\nfalse scarabs that Sybil wears.",
    "It puts you off.",
    "And if Mr Bradley had\nturned out to be a quack practitioner or a pseudoastrologer youd\nstill be unconvinced.",
    "But since he turns out to be a nasty downtoearth little legal crook  or thats the impression you give me \n\nNear enough I said.",
    "Then that makes the whole thing come into line.",
    "However phony it\nmay sound those three women at the Pale Horse have got hold of\nsomething that works.",
    "If youre so convinced then why Mrs Tuckerton\n\nExtra check said Ginger.",
    "We know what Thyrza Grey says she\ncan do.",
    "We know how the financial side is worked.",
    "We know a little\nabout three of the victims.",
    "We want to know more about the client\nangle.",
    "And suppose Mrs Tuckerton shows no signs of having been a\nclient\n\nThen well have to investigate elsewhere.",
    "Of course I may boob it I said gloomily.",
    "Ginger said that I must think better of myself than that.",
    "So here I was arriving at the front door of Carraway Park.",
    "It\ncertainly did not look like my preconceived idea of a Nash house.",
    "In\nmany ways it was a near castle of modest proportions.",
    "Ginger had\npromised to supply me with a recent book on Nash architecture\nbut it had not arrived in time so I was here somewhat inadequately\nbriefed.",
    "I rang the bell and a rather seedylooking man in an alpaca coat\nopened the door.",
    "Mr Easterbrook he said.",
    "Mrs Tuckertons expecting you.",
    "He showed me into an elaborately furnished drawing room.",
    "The\nroom made a disagreeable impression upon me.",
    "Everything in it\nwas expensive but chosen without taste.",
    "Left to itself it could have\nbeen a room of pleasant proportions.",
    "There were one or two good\npictures and a great many bad ones.",
    "There was a great deal of\nyellow brocade.",
    "Further cogitations were interrupted by the arrival\nof Mrs Tuckerton herself.",
    "I arose with difficulty from the depths of a\nbright yellow brocade sofa.",
    "I dont know what I had expected but I suffered a complete reversal\nof feeling.",
    "There was nothing sinister here merely a completely\nordinary young to middleaged woman.",
    "Not a very interesting\nwoman and not I thought a particularly nice woman.",
    "The lips in\nspite of a generous application of lipstick were thin and badtempered.",
    "The chin receded a little.",
    "The eyes were pale blue and\ngave the impression that she was appraising the price of\neverything.",
    "She was the sort of woman who undertipped porters\nand cloakroom attendants.",
    "There are a lot of women of her type to\n\n\fbe met in the world though mainly less expensively dressed and\nnot so well madeup.",
    "Mr Easterbrook She was clearly delighted by my visit.",
    "She even\ngushed a little.",
    "Im so pleased to meet you.",
    "Fancy your being\ninterested in this house.",
    "Of course I knew it was built by John Nash\nmy husband told me so but I never realised that it would be\ninteresting to a person like you\n\nWell you see Mrs Tuckerton its not quite his usual style and that\nmakes it interesting to  er \n\nShe saved me the trouble of continuing.",
    "Im afraid Im terribly stupid about that sort of thing  architecture I\nmean and archeology and all that.",
    "But you mustnt mind my\nignorance \n\nI didnt mind at all.",
    "I preferred it.",
    "Of course all that sort of thing is terribly interesting said Mrs\nTuckerton.",
    "I said that we specialists on the contrary were usually terribly dull\nand very boring on our own particular subject.",
    "Mrs Tuckerton said she was sure that that wasnt true and would I\nlike to have tea first and see the house afterwards or see round the\nhouse and then have tea.",
    "I hadnt bargained for tea  my appointment had been for threethirty but I said that perhaps the house first.",
    "She showed me round chattering vivaciously most of the time and\nthus relieving me of uttering any architectural judgments.",
    "It was lucky she said that Id come now.",
    "The house was up for sale\n Its too big for me since my husbands death  and she believed\nthere was a purchaser already though the agents had only had it\non their books for just over a week.",
    "I wouldnt have liked you to see it when it was empty.",
    "I think a\nhouse needs to be lived in if one is really to appreciate it dont you\nMr Easterbrook\n\nI would have preferred this house unlived in and unfurnished but\nnaturally I could not say so.",
    "I asked her if she was going to remain\nin the neighbourhood.",
    "Really Im not quite sure.",
    "I shall travel a little first.",
    "Get into the\nsunshine.",
    "I hate this miserable climate.",
    "Actually I think I shall winter\nin Egypt.",
    "I was there two years ago.",
    "Such a wonderful country but I\nexpect you know all about it.",
    "I knew nothing about Egypt and said so.",
    "I expect youre just being modest she said gaily and vaguely.",
    "This is the dining room.",
    "Its octagonal.",
    "Thats right isnt it No\ncorners.",
    "I said she was quite right and praised the proportions.",
    "Presently the tour completed we returned to the drawing room\nand Mrs Tuckerton rang for tea.",
    "It was brought in by the seedylooking manservant.",
    "There was a vast Victorian silver teapot which\ncould have done with a clean.",
    "Mrs Tuckerton sighed as he left the room.",
    "Servants are really impossible nowadays she said.",
    "After my\nhusband died the married couple he had had for nearly twenty\nyears insisted on leaving.",
    "They said they were retiring but I heard\nafterwards that they took another post.",
    "A very highly paid one.",
    "I\nthink its absurd myself to pay these high wages.",
    "When you think\nwhat servants board and lodging costs  to say nothing of their\nlaundry.",
    "Yes I thought mean.",
    "The pale eyes the tight mouth  avarice was\nthere.",
    "There was no difficulty in getting Mrs Tuckerton to talk.",
    "She liked\ntalking.",
    "She liked in particular talking about herself.",
    "Presently by\nlistening with close attention and uttering an encouraging word\nnow and then I knew a good deal about Mrs Tuckerton.",
    "I knew too\nmore than she was conscious of telling me.",
    "I knew that she had\nmarried Thomas Tuckerton a widower five years ago.",
    "She had\nbeen much much younger than he was.",
    "She had met him at a big\nseaside hotel where she had been a bridge hostess.",
    "She was not\naware that that last fact had slipped out.",
    "He had had a daughter at\n\n\fschool near there  so difficult for a man to know what to do with a\ngirl when he takes her out.",
    "Poor Thomas he was so lonely... his first wife had died some years\nback and he missed her very much.",
    "Mrs Tuckertons picture of herself continued.",
    "A gracious kindly\nwoman taking pity on this aging lonely man.",
    "His deteriorating health\nand her devotion.",
    "Though of course in the last stages of his illness I couldnt really\nhave any friends of my own.",
    "Had there been I wondered some men friends whom Thomas\nTuckerton had thought undesirable It might explain the terms of\nhis will.",
    "Ginger had looked up the terms of his will for me at Somerset\nHouse.",
    "Bequests to old servants to a couple of godchildren and then\nprovision for his wife  sufficient but not unduly generous.",
    "A sum in\ntrust the income to be enjoyed during her lifetime.",
    "The residue of\nhis estate which ran into a sum of six figures to his daughter\nThomasina Ann to be hers absolutely at the age of twentyone or\non her marriage.",
    "If she died before twentyone unmarried the\nmoney was to go to her stepmother.",
    "There had been it seemed no\nother members of the family.",
    "The prize I thought had been a big one.",
    "And Mrs Tuckerton liked\nmoney... it stuck out all over her.",
    "She had never had any money of\nher own I was sure till she married her elderly widower.",
    "And then\nperhaps it had gone to her head.",
    "Hampered in her life with an\ninvalid husband she had looked forward to the time when she\nwould be free still young and rich beyond her wildest dreams.",
    "The will perhaps had been a disappointment.",
    "She had dreamed of\nsomething better than a moderate income.",
    "She had looked forward\nto expensive travel to luxury cruises to clothes jewels  or\npossibly to the sheer pleasure of money itself  mounting up in the\nbank.",
    "Instead the girl was to have all that money The girl was to be a\nwealthy heiress.",
    "The girl who very likely had disliked her\nstepmother and shown it with the careless ruthlessness of youth.",
    "The girl was to be the rich one  unless...",
    "Unless... Was that enough Could I really believe that the blondehaired meretricious creature talking platitudes so glibly was\ncapable of seeking out the Pale Horse and arranging for a young\ngirl to die\n\nNo I couldnt believe it...",
    "Nevertheless I must do my stuff.",
    "I said rather abruptly\n\nI believe you know I met your daughter  stepdaughter  once\n\nShe looked at me in mild surprise though without much interest.",
    "Thomasina Did you\n\nYes in Chelsea\n\nOh Chelsea Yes it would be... She sighed.",
    "These girls\nnowadays.",
    "So difficult.",
    "One doesnt seem to have any control over\nthem.",
    "It upset her father very much.",
    "I couldnt do anything about it\nof course.",
    "She never listened to anything I said.",
    "She sighed again.",
    "She was nearly grownup you know when we married.",
    "A\nstepmother  she shook her head.",
    "Always a difficult position I said sympathetically.",
    "I made allowances  did my best in every way.",
    "Im sure you did.",
    "But it was absolutely no use.",
    "Of course Tom wouldnt allow her to\nbe actually rude to me but she sailed as near the wind as she\ncould.",
    "She really made life quite impossible.",
    "In a way it was a relief\nto me when she insisted on leaving home but I could quite\nunderstand how Tom felt about it.",
    "She got in with a most\nundesirable set.",
    "I  rather gathered that I said.",
    "Poor Thomasina.",
    "said Mrs Tuckerton.",
    "She adjusted a stray lock of\nblonde hair.",
    "Then she looked at me.",
    "Oh but perhaps you dont\n\n\fknow.",
    "She died about a month ago.",
    "Encephalitis  very sudden.",
    "Its\na disease that attacks young people I believe  so sad.",
    "I did know she was dead I said.",
    "I got up.",
    "Thank you Mrs Tuckerton very much indeed for showing me your\nhouse.",
    "I shook hands.",
    "Then as I moved away I turned back.",
    "By the way I said.",
    "I think you know the Pale Horse dont you\n\nThere wasnt any doubt of the reaction.",
    "Panic sheer panic showed\nin those pale eyes.",
    "Beneath the makeup her face was suddenly\nwhite and afraid.",
    "Her voice came shrill and high\n\nPale Horse What do you mean by the Pale Horse I dont know\nanything about the Pale Horse.",
    "I let mild surprise show in my eyes.",
    "Oh my mistake.",
    "Theres a very interesting old pub in Much\nDeeping.",
    "I was down there the other day and was taken to see it.",
    "Its been charmingly converted keeping all the atmosphere.",
    "I\ncertainly thought your name was mentioned  but perhaps it was\n\n\fyour stepdaughter who had been down there  or someone else of\nthe same name.",
    "I paused.",
    "The place has got  quite a reputation.",
    "I enjoyed my exit line.",
    "In one of the mirrors on the wall I saw Mrs\nTuckertons face reflected.",
    "She was staring after me.",
    "She was very\nvery frightened and I saw just how she would look in years to come.",
    "It was not a pleasant sight.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nSo now were quite sure said Ginger.",
    "We were sure before.",
    "Yes  reasonably so.",
    "But this does clinch it.",
    "I was silent for a moment or two.",
    "I was visualizing Mrs Tuckerton\njourneying to Birmingham.",
    "Entering the Municipal Square Buildings\n meeting Mr Bradley.",
    "Her nervous apprehension... his reassuring\nbonhomie.",
    "His skilful underlining of the lack of risk.",
    "He would have\nhad to underline that very hard with Mrs Tuckerton.",
    "I could see her\ngoing away not committing herself.",
    "Letting the idea take root in her\nmind.",
    "Perhaps she went to see her stepdaughter or her\nstepdaughter came home for a weekend.",
    "There could have been\ntalk hints of marriage.",
    "And all the time the thought of the money not just a little money not a miserly pittance  but lots of money big\nmoney money that enabled you to do everything you had ever\nwanted And all going to this degenerate illmannered girl\n\n\fslouching about in the coffee bars of Chelsea in her jeans and her\nsloppy jumpers with her undesirable degenerate friends.",
    "Why\nshould a girl like that a girl who was no good and would never be\nany good have all that beautiful money\n\nAnd so another visit to Birmingham.",
    "More caution more\nreassurance.",
    "Finally a discussion on terms.",
    "I smiled involuntarily.",
    "Mr Bradley would not have had it all his own way.",
    "She would have\nbeen a hard bargainer.",
    "But in the end the terms had been agreed\nsome document duly signed and then what\n\nThat was where imagination stopped.",
    "That was what we didnt\nknow.",
    "I came out of my meditation to see Ginger watching me.",
    "She asked Got it all worked out\n\nHow did you know what I was doing\n\nIm beginning to know the way your mind works.",
    "You were working\nit out werent you following her  to Birmingham and all the rest of\nit\n\nYes.",
    "But I was brought up short.",
    "At the moment when she had\nsettled things in Birmingham  What happens next\n\nWe looked at each other.",
    "Sooner or later said Ginger someone has got to find out exactly\nwhat happens at the Pale Horse.",
    "How\n\nI dont know... it wont be easy.",
    "Nobody whos actually been there\nwhos actually done it will ever tell.",
    "At the same time theyre the\nonly people who can tell.",
    "Its difficult...",
    "I wonder...\n\nWe could go to the police I suggested.",
    "Yes.",
    "After all weve got something fairly definite now.",
    "Enough to\nact upon do you think\n\nI shook my head doubtfully.",
    "Evidence of intent.",
    "But is that enough Its this deathwish\nnonsense.",
    "Oh I forestalled her interruption it maynt be\nnonsense but it would sound like it in court.",
    "Weve no idea even of\nwhat the actual procedure is.",
    "Well then weve got to know.",
    "But how\n\nOne would have to see  or hear  with ones own eyes and ears.",
    "But theres absolutely no place one could hide oneself in that great\nbarn of a room  and I suppose thats where it  whatever it is must take place.",
    "Ginger sat up very straight gave her head a kind of toss rather like\nan energetic terrier and said\n\n\fTheres only one way to find out what does really happen.",
    "Youve\ngot to be a genuine client.",
    "I stared at her.",
    "A genuine client\n\nYes.",
    "You or I it doesnt matter which has got to want somebody\nput out of the way.",
    "One of us has got to go to Bradley and fix it up.",
    "I dont like it I said sharply.",
    "Why\n\nWell  it opens up dangerous possibilities.",
    "For us\n\nPerhaps.",
    "But I was really thinking about the victim.",
    "Weve got to\nhave a victim  weve got to give him a name.",
    "It cant be just\ninvention.",
    "They might check up  in fact theyd almost certainly\ncheck up dont you agree\n\nGinger thought a minute and then nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "The victims got to be a real person with a real address.",
    "Thats what I dont like I said.",
    "And weve got to have a real reason for getting rid of him.",
    "We were silent a moment considering this aspect of the situation.",
    "The person whoever it was would have to agree I said slowly.",
    "Its a lot to ask.",
    "The whole setup has got to be good said Ginger thinking it out.",
    "But theres one thing you were absolutely right in what you were\nsaying the other day.",
    "The weakness of the whole thing is that\ntheyre in a cleft stick.",
    "This business has got to be secret  but not\ntoo secret.",
    "Possible clients have got to be able to hear about it.",
    "What puzzles me I said is that the police dont seem to have\nheard about it.",
    "After all theyre usually aware of what kind of\ncriminal activities are going on.",
    "Yes but I think that the reason for that is that this is in every\nsense of the word an amateur show.",
    "Its not professional.",
    "No\nprofessional criminals are employed or involved.",
    "Its not like hiring\ngangsters to bump people off.",
    "Its all  private.",
    "I said that I thought she had something there.",
    "Ginger went on\n\nSuppose now that you or I well examine both possibilities are\ndesperate to get rid of someone.",
    "Now who is there that you and I\ncould want to do away with Theres my dear old Uncle Mervyn  Ill\ncome into a very nice packet when he pops off.",
    "I and some cousin in\n\n\fAustralia are the only ones left of the family.",
    "So theres a motive\nthere.",
    "But hes over seventy and more or less gaga so it would\nreally seem more sensible for me to wait for natural causes  unless\nI was in some terrible hole for money  and that really would be\nquite difficult to fake.",
    "Besides hes a pet and Im very fond of him\nand gaga or not gaga he quite enjoys life and I wouldnt want to\ndeprive him of a minute of it  or even risk such a thing What about\nyou Have you got any relatives who are going to leave you\nmoney\n\nI shook my head.",
    "No one at all.",
    "Bother.",
    "It could be blackmail perhaps That would take a lot of\nfixing though.",
    "Youre not really vulnerable enough.",
    "If you were an\nM.P.",
    "or in the Foreign Office or an upandcoming Minister it would\nbe different.",
    "The same with me.",
    "Fifty years ago it would have been\neasy.",
    "Compromising letters or photographs in the altogether but\nreally nowadays who cares One can be like the Duke of\nWellington and say Publish and be damned Well now what else is\nthere Bigamy She fixed me with a reproachful stare.",
    "What a\npity it is youve never been married.",
    "We could have cooked\nsomething up if you had.",
    "Some expression on my face must have given me away.",
    "Ginger was\nquick.",
    "Im sorry she said.",
    "Have I raked up something that hurts\n\n\fNo I said.",
    "It doesnt hurt.",
    "It was a long time ago.",
    "I rather doubt if\ntheres anyone now who knows about it.",
    "You married someone\n\nYes.",
    "While I was at the University.",
    "We kept it dark.",
    "She wasnt well my people would have cut up rough.",
    "I wasnt even of age.",
    "We\nlied about our ages.",
    "I was silent a moment or two reliving the past.",
    "It wouldnt have lasted I said slowly.",
    "I know that now.",
    "She was\npretty and she could be very sweet... ut...\n\nWhat happened\n\nWe went to Italy in the long vacation.",
    "There was an accident  a car\naccident.",
    "She was killed outright.",
    "And you\n\nI wasnt in the car.",
    "She was  with a friend.",
    "Ginger gave me a quick glance.",
    "I think she understood the way it\nhad been.",
    "The shock of my discovery that the girl I had married was\nnot the kind who makes a faithful wife.",
    "Ginger reverted to practical matters.",
    "You were married in England\n\n\fYes.",
    "Registry office in Peterborough.",
    "But she died in Italy\n\nYes.",
    "So there will be no record of her death in England\n\nNo.",
    "Then what more do you want Its an answer to prayer Nothing\ncould be simpler Youre desperately in love with someone and you\nwant to marry her  but you dont know whether your wife is still\nalive.",
    "Youve parted years ago and never heard from her since.",
    "Dare you risk it While youre thinking it out sudden reappearance\nof the wife She turns up out of the blue refuses to give you a\ndivorce and threatens to go to your young woman and spill the\nbeans.",
    "Whos my young woman I asked slightly confused.",
    "You\n\nGinger looked shocked.",
    "Certainly not.",
    "Im quite the wrong type  Id probably go and live in\nsin with you.",
    "No you know quite well who I mean  and shell be\nexactly right I should say.",
    "That statuesque brunette you go around\nwith.",
    "Very highbrow and serious.",
    "Hermia Redcliffe\n\n\fThats right.",
    "Your steady.",
    "Who told you about her\n\nPoppy of course.",
    "Shes rich too isnt she\n\nShes extremely well off.",
    "But really \n\nAll right all right.",
    "Im not saying youre marrying her for her\nmoney.",
    "Youre not the kind.",
    "But nasty minds like Bradleys could\neasily think so... very well then.",
    "Heres the position.",
    "You are about\nto pop the question to Hermia when up turns the unwanted wife\nfrom the past.",
    "She arrives in London and the fats in the fire.",
    "You\nurge a divorce  she wont play.",
    "Shes vindictive.",
    "And then  you\nhear of the Pale Horse.",
    "Ill bet anything you like that Thyrza and\nthat halfwitted peasant Bella thought that that was why you came\nthat day.",
    "They took it as a tentative approach and thats why\nThyrza was so forthcoming.",
    "It was a sales talk they were giving\nyou.",
    "It could have been I suppose.",
    "I went over that day in my mind.",
    "And your going to Bradley soon after fits in perfectly.",
    "Youre\nhooked Youre a prospect.",
    "She paused triumphantly.",
    "There was something in what she said but I didnt quite see...",
    "I still think I said that theyll investigate very carefully.",
    "Sure to Ginger agreed.",
    "Its all very well to invent a fictitious wife resurrected from the\npast  but theyll want details  where she lives  all that.",
    "And when I\ntry to hedge \n\nYou wont need to hedge.",
    "To do the thing properly the wife has got\nto be there  and she will be there\n\nBrace yourself said Ginger.",
    "Im your wife\n\nII\n\nI stared at her.",
    "Goggled I suppose would be a better term.",
    "I\nwonder really that she didnt burst out laughing.",
    "I was just recovering myself when she spoke again.",
    "Theres no need to be so taken aback she said.",
    "Its not a\nproposal.",
    "I found my tongue.",
    "You dont know what youre saying.",
    "Of course I do.",
    "What Im suggesting is perfectly feasible  and it\nhas the advantage of not dragging some innocent person into\npossible danger.",
    "Its putting yourself in danger.",
    "Thats my lookout.",
    "No it isnt.",
    "And anyway it wouldnt hold water for a moment.",
    "Oh yes it would.",
    "Ive been thinking it out.",
    "I arrive at a furnished\nflat with a suitcase or two with foreign labels.",
    "I take the flat in the\nname of Mrs Easterbrook  and who on earth is to say Im not Mrs\nEasterbrook\n\nAnyone who knows you.",
    "Anyone who knows me wont see me.",
    "Im away from my job ill. A\nspot of hair dye  what was your wife by the way dark or blonde not that it really matters.",
    "Dark I said mechanically.",
    "Good Id hate a bleach.",
    "Different clothes and lots of makeup and\nmy best friend wouldnt look at me twice.",
    "And since you havent had\na wife in evidence for the last fifteen years or so  no ones likely to\nspot that Im not her.",
    "Why should anyone in the Pale Horse doubt\nIm who I say I am If youre prepared to sign papers wagering large\nsums of money that Ill stay alive theres not likely to be any doubt\nas to my being the bona fide article.",
    "Youre not connected with the\n\n\fpolice in any way  youre a genuine client.",
    "They can verify the\nmarriage by looking up old records in Somerset House.",
    "They can\ncheck up on your friendship with Hermia and all that  so why\nshould there be any doubts\n\nYou dont realise the difficulties  the risk.",
    "Risk  Hell said Ginger.",
    "Id love to help you win a miserly\nhundred pounds or whatever it is from that shark Bradley.",
    "I looked at her.",
    "I liked her very much... her red hair her freckles\nher gallant spirit.",
    "But I couldnt let her take the risks she wanted to\ntake.",
    "I cant stand for it Ginger I said.",
    "Suppose  something\nhappened.",
    "To me\n\nYes.",
    "Isnt that my affair\n\nNo.",
    "I got you in on all this.",
    "She nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Yes perhaps you did.",
    "But who got there first doesnt matter much.",
    "Were both in it now  and weve got to do something.",
    "Im being\nserious now Mark.",
    "Im not pretending this is all just fun.",
    "If what we\n\n\fbelieve to be true is true its a sickening beastly thing.",
    "And its got\nto be stopped You see its not hotblooded murder from hate or\njealousy its not even murder from cupidity the human frailty of\nmurder for gain but taking the risk yourself.",
    "Its murder as a\nbusiness  murder that takes no account of who or what the victim\nmay be.",
    "That is she added if the whole thing is true\n\nShe looked at me in momentary doubt.",
    "It is true I said.",
    "Thats why Im afraid for you.",
    "Ginger put both elbows on the table and began to argue.",
    "We thrashed it out to and fro dingdong repeating ourselves while\nthe hands of the clock on my mantelpiece moved slowly round.",
    "Finally Ginger summed up.",
    "Its like this.",
    "Im forewarned and forearmed.",
    "I know what someone\nis trying to do to me.",
    "And I dont believe for one moment she can do\nit If everyones got a desire for death mine isnt well developed\nIve good health.",
    "And I simply cannot believe that Ill develop\ngallstones\n\nor\n\nmeningitis\n\njust\n\nbecause\n\nold\n\nThyrza\n\ndraws\n\npentagrams on the floor or Sybil throws a trance  or whatever it is\nthose women do do.",
    "Bella sacrifices a white cock I should imagine I said thoughtfully.",
    "You must admit its all terribly bogus\n\nWe dont know what actually does happen I pointed out.",
    "No.",
    "Thats why its important to find out.",
    "But do you believe really\nbelieve that because of what three women can do in the barn of the\nPale Horse I in a flat in London will develop some fatal disease\nYou cant\n\nNo I said.",
    "I cant believe it.",
    "But I added.",
    "I do...\n\nWe looked at each other.",
    "Yes said Ginger.",
    "Thats our weakness.",
    "Look here I said.",
    "Lets make it the other way round.",
    "Let me be\nthe one in London.",
    "You be the client.",
    "We can cook up something \n\nBut Ginger was vigorously shaking her head.",
    "No Mark she said.",
    "It wont work that way.",
    "For several reasons.",
    "The most important is that Im known at the Pale Horse already  as\nmy carefree self.",
    "They could get all the dope about my life from\nRhoda  and theres nothing there.",
    "But you are in the ideal position\nalready  youre a nervous client sniffing around not able yet to\ncommit yourself.",
    "No its got to be this way.",
    "I dont like it.",
    "I dont like to think of you  alone in some place under\na false name  with nobody to keep an eye on you.",
    "I think before we\nembark on this we ought to go to the police  now  before we try\nanything else.",
    "Im agreeable to that said Ginger slowly.",
    "In fact I think its what\nyou ought to do.",
    "Youve got something to go on.",
    "What police\nScotland Yard\n\nNo I said.",
    "I think Divisional DetectiveInspector Lejeune is the\nbest bet.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nI liked Divisional DetectiveInspector Lejeune at first sight.",
    "He had\nan air of quiet ability.",
    "I thought too that he was an imaginative man\n the kind of man who would be willing to consider possibilities that\nwere not orthodox.",
    "He said\n\nDr Corrigan has told me of his meeting with you.",
    "Hes taken a great\ninterest in this business from the first.",
    "Father Gorman of course\nwas very wellknown and respected in the district.",
    "Now you say you\nhave some special information for us\n\nIt concerns I said a place called the Pale Horse.",
    "In I understand a village called Much Deeping\n\nYes.",
    "Tell me about it.",
    "I told him of the first mention of the Pale Horse at the Fantasie.",
    "Then\nI described my visit to Rhoda and my introduction to the three\nweird sisters.",
    "I related as accurately as I could Thyrza Greys\nconversation on that particular afternoon.",
    "And you were impressed by what she said\n\nI felt embarrassed.",
    "Well not really.",
    "I mean I didnt seriously believe \n\nDidnt you Mr Easterbrook I rather think you did.",
    "I suppose youre right.",
    "One just doesnt like admitting how\ncredulous one is.",
    "Lejeune smiled.",
    "But youve left something out havent you You were already\ninterested when you came to Much Deeping  why\n\nI think it was the girl looking so scared.",
    "The young lady in the flower shop\n\n\fYes.",
    "Shed thrown out her remark about the Pale Horse so\ncasually.",
    "Her being so scared seemed to underline the fact that\nthere was  well something to be scared about.",
    "And then I met Dr\nCorrigan and he told me about the list of names.",
    "Two of them I\nalready knew.",
    "Both were dead.",
    "A third name seemed familiar.",
    "Afterwards I found that she too had died.",
    "That would be Mrs Delafontaine\n\nYes.",
    "Go on.",
    "I made up my mind that Id got to find out more about this\nbusiness.",
    "And you set about it how\n\nI told him of my call on Mrs Tuckerton.",
    "Finally I came to Mr Bradley\nand the Municipal Square Buildings in Birmingham.",
    "I had his full interest now.",
    "He repeated the name.",
    "Bradley he said.",
    "So Bradleys in this\n\nYou know him\n\nOh yes we know all about Mr Bradley.",
    "Hes given us a lot of\ntrouble.",
    "Hes a smooth dealer an adept at never doing anything\n\n\fthat we can pin on him.",
    "He knows every trick and dodge of the legal\ngame.",
    "Hes always just on the right side of the line.",
    "Hes the kind of\nman who could write a book like those old cookery books A\nhundred ways of evading the law.",
    "But murder such a thing as\norganized murder  I should have said that that was right off his\nbeat.",
    "Yes  right off his beat.",
    "Now that Ive told you about our conversation could you act upon\nit\n\nLejeune slowly shook his head.",
    "No we couldnt act on it.",
    "To begin with there were no witnesses to\nyour conversation.",
    "It was just between the two of you and he could\ndeny the whole thing if he wanted to Apart from that he was quite\nright when he told you that a man can bet on anything.",
    "He bets\nsomebody wont die  and he loses.",
    "What is there criminal about\nthat Unless we can connect Bradley in some way with the actual\ncrime in question  and that I imagine will not be easy.",
    "He left it with a shrug of his shoulders.",
    "He paused a minute and\nthen said\n\nDid you by any chance come across a man called Venables when\nyou were down in Much Deeping\n\nYes I said I did.",
    "I was taken over to lunch with him one day.",
    "Ah What impression if I may ask did he make upon you\n\n\fA very powerful impression.",
    "Hes a man of great personality.",
    "An\ninvalid.",
    "Yes.",
    "Crippled by polio\n\nHe can only move about in a wheelchair.",
    "But his disability seems\nto have heightened his determination to live and enjoy living.",
    "Tell me all you can about him.",
    "I described Venables house his art treasures the range and\nsweep of his interests.",
    "Lejeune said\n\nIts a pity.",
    "What is a pity\n\nHe said dryly That Venables is a cripple.",
    "Excuse me but you are quite certain he really is a cripple He\ncouldnt be  well  faking the whole thing\n\nWere as sure of his being a cripple as one can be sure of anything.",
    "His doctor is Sir William Dugdale of Harley Street a man absolutely\nabove suspicion.",
    "We have Sir Williams assurance that the limbs are\natrophied.",
    "Our little Mr Osborne may be certain that Venables was\nthe man he saw walking along Barton street that night.",
    "But hes\nwrong.",
    "I see.",
    "As I say its a pity because if there is such a thing as an\norganization for private murder Venables is the kind of man who\nwould be capable of planning it.",
    "Yes thats what I thought.",
    "With his forefinger Lejeune traced interlacing circles on the table in\nfront of him.",
    "Then he looked up sharply.",
    "Lets assemble what weve got adding to our own knowledge the\nknowledge youve brought us.",
    "It seems reasonably certain that\nthere is some agency or organization that specializes in what one\nmight call the removal of unwanted persons.",
    "Theres nothing crude\nabout the organization.",
    "It doesnt employ ordinary thugs or\ngunmen... theres nothing to show that the victims havent died a\nperfectly natural death.",
    "I may say that in addition to the three\ndeaths youve mentioned weve got a certain amount of rather\nindefinite information about some of the others  deaths were from\nnatural causes in each instance but there were those who profited\nby these deaths.",
    "No evidence mind you.",
    "Its clever damnably clever Mr Easterbrook.",
    "Whoever thought it\nout  and its been thought out in great detail  has brains.",
    "Weve\nonly got hold of a few scattered names.",
    "Heaven knows how many\nmore of them there are  how widespread the whole thing may be.",
    "And weve only got the few names we have got by the accident of a\n\n\fwoman knowing herself to be dying and wanting to make her\npeace with heaven.",
    "He shook his head angrily and then went on\n\nThis woman Thyrza Grey you say she boasted to you about her\npowers Well she can do so with impunity.",
    "Charge her with murder\nput her in the dock let her trumpet to heaven and a jury that she\nhas released people from the toils of this world by willpower or\nweaving spells  or what have you.",
    "She wouldnt be guilty according\nto the law.",
    "Shes never been near the people who died weve\nchecked on that she hasnt sent them poisoned chocolates through\nthe post or anything of that kind.",
    "According to her own account\nshe just sits in a room and employs telepathy Why the whole thing\nwould be laughed out of court\n\nI murmured\n\nBut Lu and Aengus laugh not.",
    "Nor any in the high celestial House.",
    "Whats that\n\nSorry.",
    "A quotation from the Immortal Hour.",
    "Well its true enough.",
    "The devils in Hell are laughing but not the\nHost of Heaven.",
    "Its an  an evil business Mr Easterbrook.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "Its a word that we dont use very much nowadays.",
    "But its the only word applicable here.",
    "Thats why \n\n\fYes\n\nLejeune looked at me inquiringly.",
    "I spoke in a rush.",
    "I think theres a chance  a possible chance  of\ngetting to know a bit more about all this.",
    "I and a friend of mine have\nworked out a plan.",
    "You may think it very silly \n\nIll be the judge of that.",
    "First of all I take it from what youve said that you are sure in your\nmind that there is such an organization as the one weve been\ndiscussing and that it works\n\nIt certainly works.",
    "But you dont know how it works The first steps are already\nformulated.",
    "The individual I call the client hears vaguely about this\norganization gets to know more about it is sent to Mr Bradley in\nBirmingham and decides that he will go ahead.",
    "He enters into\nsome agreement with Bradley and then is or so I presume sent to\nthe Pale Horse.",
    "But what happens after that we dont know What\nexactly happens at the Pale Horse Somebodys got to go and find\nout.",
    "Go on.",
    "Because until we do know exactly what Thyrza Grey actually\ndoes we cant get any further.",
    "Your police doctor Jim Corrigan\n\n\fsays the whole idea is poppycock  but is it Inspector Lejeune is\nit\n\nLejeune sighed.",

    "Protested that I\nhadnt got that amount of money.",
    "Bradley was skilful.",
    "He knew by\nsome means or other just what sum I could raise in an emergency.",
    "He knew that Hermia had money.",
    "His delicate hint that later when I\nwas married I wouldnt feel the loss of my bet was proof of that.",
    "Moreover my urgency put him in a fine position.",
    "He wouldnt come\ndown.",
    "When I left him the fantastic wager was laid and accepted.",
    "I signed some form of I.O.U.",
    "The phraseology was too full of legal\nphrases for me to understand.",
    "Actually I very much doubted that it\nhad any legal significance whatever.",
    "Is this legally binding I asked him.",
    "I dont think said Mr Bradley showing his excellent dentures\nthat it will ever be put to the test.",
    "His smile was not a very nice one.",
    "A bets a bet.",

    "Dont ask me why.",
    "Ive not the least idea.",
    "Miss Grey\nkeeps her secrets to herself.",
    "But what happens What does she do\n\nYou really must believe me Mr Easterbrook when I tell you that\nhonestly I havent the least idea I dont know  and what is more I\ndont want to know  lets leave it at that.",
    "He paused and then went on in an almost fatherly tone.",
    "My advice is as follows Mr Easterbrook.",
    "Pay a visit to your wife.",
    "Soothe her down let her think that youre coming round to the idea\nof a reconciliation.",
    "I should suggest saying that you have to go\nabroad for a few weeks but that on your return et cetera et\ncetera...\n\nAnd then\n\nHaving purloined a trifle of daily wear in an unobtrusive manner\nyou will go down to Much Deeping.",
    "He paused thoughtfully.",
    "Let\nme see I think you mentioned on your previous visit that you had\nfriends  relations  in the neighbourhood\n\nA cousin.",
    "That makes it very simple.",
    "This cousin will doubtless put you up for\na day or so.",
    "What do most people do Stay at the local inn\n\nSometimes I believe  or they motor over from Bournemouth.",
    "Something of that kind  but I know very little about the matter.",
    "What  er  is my cousin likely to think\n\nYou express yourself as intrigued by the inhabitants of the Pale\nHorse.",
    "You want to participate in a s\u0439ance there.",
    "Nothing can\n\n\fsound simpler.",
    "Miss Grey and her medium friend often indulge in\ns\u0439ances.",
    "You know what spiritualists are.",
    "You go protesting that of\ncourse its nonsense but that it will interest you.",
    "That is all Mr\nEasterbrook.",
    "As you see nothing can be simpler.",
    "And  and after that\n\nHe shook his head smiling.",
    "Thats all I can tell you.",
    "All in fact that I know.",
    "Miss Thyrza Grey\nwill then be in charge.",
    "Dont forget to take the glove or\nhandkerchief or whatever it is with you.",
    "Afterwards I would\nsuggest that you take a little trip abroad.",
    "The Italian Riviera is very\npleasant at this time of year.",
    "Just for a week or two say.",
    "I said that I didnt want to go abroad.",
    "I said I wanted to stay in\nEngland.",
    "Very well then but definitely not London.",
    "No I must strongly\nadvise not London.",
    "Why not\n\nMr Bradley looked at me reprovingly.",
    "Clients are guaranteed complete  er  safety he said if they\nobey orders.",
    "What about Bournemouth Would Bournemouth do\n\n\fYes Bournemouth would be adequate.",
    "Stay at a hotel make a few\nacquaintances be seen in their company.",
    "The blameless life  that\nis what we aim at.",
    "You can always go on to Torquay if you get tired\nof Bournemouth.",
    "He spoke with the affability of a travel agent.",
    "Once again I had to\nshake his podgy hand.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nAre you really going to a s\u0439ance at Thyrzas Rhoda demanded.",
    "Why not\n\nI never knew you were interested in that sort of thing Mark.",
    "Im not really I said truthfully.",
    "But its such a queer setup those\nthree.",
    "Im curious to see what sort of a show they put on.",
    "I did not find it really easy to put on a light manner.",
    "Out of the tail of\nmy eye I saw Hugh Despard looking at me thoughtfully.",
    "He was a\nshrewd man with an adventurous life behind him.",
    "One of those men\nwho have a kind of sixth sense where danger is concerned.",
    "I think\nhe scented its presence now  realized that something more\nimportant than idle curiosity was at stake.",
    "Then I shall come with you said Rhoda gleefully.",
    "Ive always\nwanted to.",
    "Youll do nothing of the sort Rhoda growled Despard.",
    "But I dont really believe in spirits and all that Hugh.",
    "You know I\ndont.",
    "I just want to go for the fun of it\n\nThat sort of business isnt fun said Despard.",
    "There may be\nsomething genuine to it there probably is.",
    "But it doesnt have a\ngood effect on people who go out of idle curiosity.",
    "Then you ought to dissuade Mark too.",
    "Marks not my responsibility said Despard.",
    "But again he gave me that quick sidelong look.",
    "He knew I was quite\nsure that I had a purpose.",
    "Rhoda was annoyed but she got over it and when we chanced to\nmeet Thyrza Grey in the village a little later that morning Thyrza\nherself was blunt upon the matter.",
    "Hallo Mr Easterbrook were expecting you this evening.",
    "Hope we\ncan put on a good show for you.",
    "Sybils a wonderful medium but\none never knows beforehand what results one will get.",
    "So you\nmustnt be disappointed.",
    "One thing I do ask you.",
    "Keep an open\nmind.",
    "An honest inquirer is always welcome  but a frivolous\nscoffing approach is bad.",
    "I wanted to come too said Rhoda.",
    "But Hugh is so frightfully\nprejudiced.",
    "You know what hes like.",
    "I wouldnt have had you anyway said Thyrza.",
    "One outsider is\nquite enough.",
    "She turned to me.",
    "Suppose you come and have a light meal with us first she said.",
    "We never eat much before a s\u0439ance.",
    "About seven oclock Good\nwell be expecting you.",
    "She nodded smiled and strode briskly away.",
    "I stared after her so\nengrossed in my surmises that I entirely missed what Rhoda was\nsaying to me.",
    "What did you say Im sorry.",
    "Youve been very odd lately Mark.",
    "Ever since you arrived.",
    "Is\nanything the matter\n\nNo of course not.",
    "What should be the matter\n\nHave you got stuck with the book Something like that\n\nThe book Just for a moment I couldnt remember anything about\nthe book.",
    "Then I said hastily Oh yes the book.",
    "Its getting on more\nor less all right.",
    "I believe youre in love said Rhoda accusingly.",
    "Yes thats it.",
    "Being in love has a very bad effect on men  it seems to addle their\nwits.",
    "Now women are just the opposite  on top of the world looking\n\n\fradiant and twice as goodlooking as usual.",
    "Funny isnt it that it\nshould suit women and only make a man look like a sick sheep\n\nThank you I said.",
    "Oh dont be cross with me Mark.",
    "I think its a very good thing\nreally and Im delighted.",
    "Shes really very nice.",
    "Whos nice\n\nHermia Redcliffe of course.",
    "You seem to think I know nothing\nabout anything.",
    "Ive seen it coming on for ages.",
    "And she really is\njust the person for you  goodlooking and clever absolutely\nsuitable.",
    "That I said is one of the cattiest things you could say about\nanyone.",
    "Rhoda looked at me.",
    "It is rather she said.",
    "She turned away and said she had to go and give a pep talk to the\nbutcher.",
    "I said that I would go and pay a call at the vicarage.",
    "But not  I forestalled any comment  in order to ask the vicar to\nput the banns up\n\nII\n\n\fComing to the vicarage was like coming home.",
    "The front door was hospitably open and as I stepped inside I was\nconscious of a burden slipping from my shoulders.",
    "Mrs Dane Calthrop came through a door at the back of the hall\ncarrying for some reason unfathomable to me an enormous plastic\npail of bright green.",
    "Hallo its you she said.",
    "I thought it would be.",
    "She handed me the pail.",
    "I had no idea what to do with it and stood\nlooking awkward.",
    "Outside the door on the step said Mrs Dane Calthrop impatiently\nas though I ought to have known.",
    "I obeyed.",
    "Then I followed her into the same dark shabby room we\nhad sat in before.",
    "There was a rather moribund fire there but Mrs\nDane Calthrop poked it into flame and dumped a log on it.",
    "Then she\nmotioned me to sit down plumped down herself and fixed me with\na bright impatient eye.",
    "Well she demanded.",
    "What have you done\n\nFrom the vigour of her manner we might have had a train to catch.",
    "You told me to do something.",
    "I am doing something.",
    "Good.",
    "What\n\nI told her.",
    "I told her everything.",
    "In some unspoken way I told her\nthings I did not quite know myself.",
    "Tonight said Mrs Dane Calthrop thoughtfully.",
    "Yes.",
    "She was silent for a minute obviously thinking.",
    "Unable to help\nmyself I blurted out I dont like it.",
    "My God I dont like it\n\nWhy should you\n\nThat of course was unanswerable.",
    "Im so horribly afraid for her.",
    "She looked at me kindly.",
    "You dont know I said how  how brave she is.",
    "If in some way\nthey manage to harm her...\n\nMrs Dane Calthrop said slowly\n\nI dont see  I really dont see  how they can harm her in the way\nyou mean.",
    "But they have harmed  other people.",
    "It would seem so yes... She sounded dissatisfied.",
    "In any other way she will be all right.",
    "Weve taken every\nimaginable precaution.",
    "No material harm can happen to her.",
    "But its material harm that these people claim to be able to\nproduce Mrs Dane Calthrop pointed out They claim to be able to\nwork through the mind on the body.",
    "Illness  disease.",
    "Very\ninteresting if they can.",
    "But quite horrible And its got to be stopped\nas weve already agreed.",
    "But shes the one whos taking the risk I muttered.",
    "Someone has to said Mrs Dane Calthrop calmly.",
    "It upsets your\npride that it shouldnt be you.",
    "Youve got to swallow that.",
    "Gingers\nideally suited for the part shes playing.",
    "She can control her nerves\nand shes intelligent.",
    "She wont let you down\n\nIm not worrying about that\n\nWell stop worrying at all.",
    "It wont do her any good.",
    "Dont lets shirk\nthe issues.",
    "If she dies as a result of this experiment then she dies in\na good cause.",
    "My God youre brutal\n\nSomebody has to be said Mrs Dane Calthrop.",
    "Always envisage\nthe worst.",
    "Youve no idea how that steadies the nerves.",
    "You begin\nat once to be sure it cant be as bad as what you imagine.",
    "She nodded at me reassuringly.",
    "You may be right I said doubtfully.",
    "Mrs Dane Calthrop said with complete certainty that of course she\nwas right.",
    "I proceeded to details.",
    "Youre on the telephone here\n\nNaturally.",
    "I explained what I wanted to do.",
    "After this  this business tonight is over I may want to keep in\nclose touch with Ginger.",
    "Ring her up every day.",
    "If I could telephone\nfrom here\n\nOf course.",
    "Too much coming and going at Rhodas.",
    "You want to be\nsure of not being overheard.",
    "I shall stay on at Rhodas for a bit.",
    "Then perhaps go to\nBournemouth.",
    "Im not supposed to  go back to London.",
    "No use looking ahead Mrs Dane Calthrop said.",
    "Not beyond\ntonight.",
    "Tonight...",
    "I got up.",
    "I said a thing that was out of character.",
    "Pray\nfor me  for us I said.",
    "Naturally said Mrs Dane Calthrop surprised that I should need to\nask.",
    "As I went out of the front door a sudden curiosity made me say\n\nWhy the pail What is it for\n\nThe pail Oh its for the schoolchildren to pick berries and leaves\nfrom the hedges  for the church.",
    "Hideous isnt it but so handy.",
    "I looked out over the richness of the autumn world.",
    "Such soft still\nbeauty...\n\nAngels and ministers of grace defend us I said.",
    "Amen said Mrs Dane Calthrop.",
    "III\n\nMy reception at the Pale Horse was conventional in the extreme.",
    "I\ndont know what particular atmospheric effect I had expected but it\nwas not this.",
    "Thyrza Grey wearing a plain dark wool dress opened the door\nsaid in a businesslike tone Ah here you are.",
    "Good.",
    "Well have\nsupper straight away.",
    "Nothing could have been more matteroffact more completely\nordinary...",
    "The table was laid for a simple meal at the end of the panelled hall.",
    "We had soup an omelette and cheese.",
    "Bella waited on us.",
    "She\nwore a black stuff dress and looked more than ever like one of the\ncrowd in an Italian primitive.",
    "Sybil struck a more exotic note.",
    "She\nhad on a long dress of some woven peacockcoloured fabric shot\nwith gold.",
    "Her beads were absent on this occasion but she had two\nheavy gold bracelets clasping her wrists.",
    "She ate a minute portion\nof omelette but nothing else.",
    "She spoke little treating us to a\nfaraway wrappedupinhigherthings mood.",
    "It ought to have been\nimpressive.",
    "Actually it was not.",
    "The effect was theatrical and\nunreal.",
    "Thyrza Grey provided what conversation there was  a brisk chatty\ncommentary on local happenings.",
    "She was this evening the British\ncountry spinster to the life pleasant efficient uninterested in\nanything beyond her immediate surroundings.",
    "I thought to myself Im mad completely mad.",
    "What is there to fear\nhere Even Bella seemed tonight only a halfwitted old peasant\nwoman  like hundreds of other women of her kind  inbred\nuntouched by education or a broader outlook.",
    "My conversation with Mrs Dane Calthrop seemed fantastic in\nretrospect.",
    "We had worked ourselves up to imagine goodness\nknows what.",
    "The idea of Ginger  Ginger with her dyed hair and\nassumed name  being in danger from anything these three very\nordinary women could do was positively ludicrous\n\nThe meal came to an end.",
    "No coffee said Thyrza apologetically.",
    "One doesnt want to be\noverstimulated.",
    "She rose.",
    "Sybil\n\nYes said Sybil her face taking on what she clearly thought was\nan ecstatic and otherworld expression.",
    "I must go and prepare...\n\nBella began to clear the table.",
    "I wandered over to where the old inn\nsign hung.",
    "Thyrza followed me.",
    "You cant really see it at all by this light she said.",
    "That was quite true.",
    "The faint pale image against the dark\nencrusted grime of the panel could hardly be distinguished as that\nof a horse.",
    "The hall was lit by feeble electric bulbs shielded by thick\nvellum shades.",
    "That redhaired girl  whats her name  Ginger something  who\nwas staying down here  said shed do a spot of cleaning and\nrestoring on it said Thyrza.",
    "Dont suppose shell ever remember\nabout it though.",
    "She added casually She works for some gallery\nor other in London.",
    "It gave me a strange feeling to hear Ginger referred to lightly and\ncasually.",
    "I said staring at the picture\n\nIt might be interesting.",
    "Its not a good painting of course said Thyrza.",
    "Just a daub.",
    "But\nit goes with the place  and its certainly well over three hundred\nyears old.",
    "Ready.",
    "We wheeled abruptly.",
    "Bella emerging out of the gloom was beckoning.",
    "Time to get on with things said Thyrza still brisk and matteroffact.",
    "I followed her as she led the way out to the converted barn.",
    "As I have said there was no entrance to it from the house.",
    "It was a\ndark overcast night no stars.",
    "We came out of the dense outer\nblackness into the long lighted room.",
    "The barn by night was transformed.",
    "By day it had seemed a\npleasant library.",
    "Now it had become something more.",
    "There were\nlamps but these were not turned on.",
    "The lighting was indirect and\nflooded the room with a soft but cold light.",
    "In the center of the floor\n\n\fwas a kind of raised bed or divan.",
    "It was spread with a purple cloth\nembroidered with various cabalistic signs.",
    "On the far side of the room was what appeared to be a small\nbrazier and next to it a big copper basin  an old one by the look of\nit.",
    "On the other side set back almost touching the wall was a heavy\noakbacked chair.",
    "Thyrza motioned me towards it.",
    "Sit there she said.",
    "I sat obediently.",
    "Thyrzas manner had changed.",
    "The odd thing was\nthat I could not define exactly in what the change consisted.",
    "There\nwas none of Sybils spurious occultism about it.",
    "It was more as\nthough an everyday curtain of normal trivial life had been lifted.",
    "Behind it was the real woman displaying something of the manner\nof a surgeon approaching the operating table for a difficult and\ndangerous operation.",
    "This impression was heightened when she\nwent to a cupboard in the wall and took from it what appeared to be\na kind of long overall.",
    "It seemed to be made when the light caught\nit of some metallic woven tissue.",
    "She drew on long gauntlets of\nwhat looked like a kind of fine mesh rather resembling a bulletproof vest I had once been shown.",
    "One has to take precautions she said.",
    "The phrase struck me as slightly sinister.",
    "Then she addressed me in an emphatic deep voice.",
    "I must impress upon you Mr Easterbrook the necessity of\nremaining absolutely still where you are.",
    "On no account must you\nmove from that chair.",
    "It might not be safe to do so.",
    "This is no childs\ngame.",
    "I am dealing with forces that are dangerous to those who do\nnot know how to handle them She paused and then asked You\nhave brought what you were instructed to bring\n\nWithout a word I drew from my pocket a brown suede glove and\nhanded it to her.",
    "She took it and moved over to a metal lamp with a gooseneck\nshade.",
    "She switched on the lamp and held the glove under its rays\nwhich were of a peculiar sickly colour turning the glove from its\nrich brown to a characterless grey.",
    "She switched off the lamp nodding in approval.",
    "Most suitable she said.",
    "The physical emanations from its wearer\nare quite strong.",
    "She put it down on top of what appeared to be a large radio cabinet\nat the end of the room.",
    "Then she raised her voice a little.",
    "Bella.",
    "Sybil.",
    "We are ready.",
    "Sybil came in first.",
    "She wore a long black cloak over her peacock\ndress.",
    "This she flung aside with a dramatic gesture.",
    "It slid down\nlooking like an inky pool on the floor.",
    "She came forward.",
    "I do hope it will be all right she said.",
    "One never knows.",
    "Please\ndont adopt a sceptical frame of mind Mr Easterbrook.",
    "It does so\nhinder things.",
    "Mr Easterbrook has not come here to mock said Thyrza.",
    "There was a certain grimness in her tone.",
    "Sybil lay down on the purple divan.",
    "Thyrza bent over her arranging\nher draperies.",
    "Quite comfortable she asked solicitously.",
    "Yes thank you dear.",
    "Thyrza switched off some lights.",
    "Then she wheeled up what was in\neffect a kind of canopy on wheels.",
    "This she placed so that it\novershadowed the divan and left Sybil in a deep shadow in the\nmiddle of outlying dim twilight.",
    "Too much light is harmful to a complete trance she said.",
    "Now I think we are ready.",
    "Bella\n\nBella came out of the shadows.",
    "The two women approached me.",
    "With her right hand Thyrza took my left.",
    "Her left hand took Bellas\nright Bellas left hand found my right hand.",
    "Thyrzas hand was dry\nand hard Bellas was cold and boneless  it felt like a slug in mine\nand I shivered in revulsion.",
    "Thyrza must have touched a switch somewhere for music sounded\nfaintly from the ceiling.",
    "I recognised it as Mendelssohns Funeral\nMarch.",
    "Mise en sc\u0438ne.",
    "I said to myself rather scornfully.",
    "Meretricious\ntrappings I was cool and critical  but nevertheless aware of an\nundercurrent of some unwanted emotional apprehension.",
    "The music stopped.",
    "There was a long wait.",
    "There was only the\nsound of breathing Bellas slightly wheezy Sybils deep and\nregular.",
    "And then suddenly Sybil spoke.",
    "Not however in her own voice.",
    "It\nwas a mans deep voice as unlike her own mincing accents as\ncould be.",
    "It had a guttural foreign accent.",
    "I am here the voice said.",
    "My hands were released.",
    "Bella flitted away into the shadows.",
    "Thyrza said Good evening.",
    "Is that Macandal\n\nI am Macandal.",
    "Thyrza went to the divan and drew away the protecting canopy.",
    "The\nsoft light flowed down on to Sybils face.",
    "She appeared to be deeply\nasleep.",
    "In this repose her face looked quite different.",
    "The lines were smoothed away.",
    "She looked years younger.",
    "One\ncould almost say that she looked beautiful.",
    "Thyrza said\n\nAre you prepared Macandal to submit to my desire and my will\n\nThe new deep voice said\n\nI am.",
    "Will you undertake to protect the body of the Dossu that lies here\nand which you now inhabit from all physical injury and harm Will\nyou dedicate its vital force to my purpose that that purpose may be\naccomplished through it\n\nI will.",
    "Will you so dedicate this body that death may pass through it\nobeying such natural laws as may be available in the body of the\nrecipient\n\nThe dead must be sent to cause death.",
    "It shall be so.",
    "Thyrza drew back a step.",
    "Bella came up and held out what I saw\nwas a crucifix.",
    "Thyrza placed it on Sybils breast in a reversed\nposition.",
    "Then Bella brought a small green phial.",
    "From this Thyrza\npoured out a drop or two on to Sybils forehead and traced\nsomething with her finger.",
    "Again I fancied that it was the sign of the\ncross upside down.",
    "She said to me briefly Holy water from the Catholic church at\nGarsington.",
    "Her voice was quite ordinary and this which ought to have broken\nthe spell did not do so.",
    "It made the whole business somehow\nmore alarming.",
    "Finally she brought that rather horrible rattle we had seen before.",
    "She shook it three times and then clasped Sybils hand round it.",
    "She stepped back and said\n\nAll is ready.",
    "Bella repeated the words\n\nAll is ready \n\nThyrza addressed me in a low tone\n\nI dont suppose youre much impressed are you by all the ritual\nSome of our visitors are.",
    "To you I dare say its all so much mumbo\njumbo.",
    "But dont be too sure.",
    "Ritual  a pattern of words and\nphrases sanctified by time and usage has an effect on the human\nspirit.",
    "What causes the mass hysteria of crowds We dont know\nexactly.",
    "But its a phenomenon that exists.",
    "These oldtime usages\nthey have their part  a necessary part I think.",
    "Bella had left the room.",
    "She came back now carrying a white cock.",
    "It was alive and struggling to be free.",
    "Now with white chalk she knelt down and began to draw signs on\nthe floor round the brazier and the copper bowl.",
    "She set down the\ncock with its beak on the white curving line round the bowl and it\nstayed there motionless.",
    "She drew more signs chanting as she did so in a low guttural\nvoice.",
    "The words were incomprehensible to me but as she knelt\nand swayed she was clearly working herself up to some pitch of\nobscene ecstasy.",
    "Watching me Thyrza said You dont like it much Its old you\nknow very old.",
    "The death spell according to old recipes handed\ndown from mother to daughter.",
    "I couldnt fathom Thyrza.",
    "She did nothing to further the effect on my\nsenses which Bellas rather horrible performances might well have\nhad.",
    "She seemed deliberately to take the part of a commentator.",
    "Bella stretched out her hands to the brazier and a flickering flame\nsprang up.",
    "She sprinkled something on the flames and a thick\ncloying perfume filled the air.",
    "We are ready said Thyrza.",
    "The surgeon I thought picks up his scalpel...\n\nShe went over to what I had taken to be a radio cabinet.",
    "It opened\nup and I saw that it was a large electrical contrivance of some\ncomplicated kind.",
    "It moved like a trolley and she wheeled it slowly and carefully to a\nposition near the divan.",
    "She bent over it adjusting the controls murmuring to herself\n\nCompass northnortheast... degrees... thats about right.",
    "She\ntook the glove and adjusted it in a particular position switching on\na small violet light beside it.",
    "Then she spoke to the inert figure on the divan.",
    "Sybil Diana Helen you are set free from your mortal sheath which\nthe spirit Macandal guards safely for you.",
    "You are free to be at one\nwith the owner of this glove.",
    "Like all human beings her goal in life is\ntowards death.",
    "There is no final satisfaction but death.",
    "Only death\nsolves all problems.",
    "Only death gives true peace.",
    "All great ones\nhave known it.",
    "Remember Macbeth After lifes fitful fever he sleeps\nwell.",
    "Remember the ecstasy of Tristan and Isolde.",
    "Love and death.",
    "Love and death.",
    "But the greatest of these is death...",
    "The words rang out echoing repeating  the big boxlike machine\nhad started to emit a low hum the bulbs in it glowed  I felt dazed\ncarried away.",
    "This I felt was no longer something at which I could\nmock.",
    "Thyrza her power unleashed was holding that prone figure\non the divan completely enslaved.",
    "She was using her.",
    "Using her for\na definite end.",
    "I realised vaguely why Mrs Oliver had been\nfrightened not of Thyrza but of the seemingly silly Sybil.",
    "Sybil had a\npower a natural gift nothing to do with mind or intellect it was a\nphysical power the power to separate herself from her body.",
    "And\n\n\fso separated her mind was not hers but Thyrzas.",
    "And Thyrza was\nusing her temporary possession.",
    "Yes but the box Where did the box come in\n\nAnd suddenly all my fear was transferred to the box What devilish\nsecret was being practised through its agency Could there be\nphysically produced rays of some kind that acted on the cells of the\nmind Of a particular mind\n\nThyrzas voice went on\n\nThe weak spot... there is always a weak spot... deep in the tissues\nof the flesh... through weakness comes strength  the strength and\npeace of death... towards death  slowly naturally towards death the true way the natural way.",
    "The tissues of the body obey the\nmind... command them  command them... towards death... death\nthe Conqueror... death... soon... very soon... Death... Death...\nDEATH\n\nHer voice rose in a great swelling cry... and another horrible animal\ncry came from Bella.",
    "She rose up a knife flashed... there was a\nhorrible strangled squawk from the cockerel... blood dripped into\nthe copper bowl.",
    "Bella came running the bowl held out...\n\nShe screamed out\n\nBlood... the blood...",
    "BLOOD\n\n\fThyrza whipped out the glove from the machine.",
    "Bella took it\ndipped it in the blood returned it to Thyrza who replaced it\n\nBellas voice rose again in that high ecstatic call...",
    "The blood... the blood... the blood...\n\nShe ran round and round the brazier then dropped twitching to the\nfloor.",
    "The brazier flickered and went out.",
    "I felt horribly sick.",
    "Unseeing clutching the arms of my chair my\nhead seemed to be whirling in space...",
    "I heard a click the hum of the machine ceased.",
    "Then Thyrzas voice rose clear and composed\n\nThe old magic and the new.",
    "The old knowledge of belief the new\nknowledge of science.",
    "Together they will prevail...\n\nChapter 18\n\nWell what was it like demanded Rhoda eagerly at the breakfast\ntable.",
    "Oh the usual stuff I said nonchalantly.",
    "I was uneasily conscious of Despards eye on me.",
    "A perceptive\nman.",
    "Pentagrams drawn on the floor\n\nLots of them.",
    "Any white cocks\n\nNaturally.",
    "That was Bellas part of the fun and games.",
    "And trances and things\n\nAs you say trances and things.",
    "Rhoda looked disappointed.",
    "You seem to have found it rather dull she said in an aggrieved\nvoice.",
    "I said that these things were all much of a sameness.",
    "At any rate Id\nsatisfied my curiosity.",
    "Later when Rhoda had departed to the kitchen Despard said to me\n\nShook you up a bit didnt it\n\nWell \n\n\fI was anxious to make light of the whole thing but Despard was not\nan easy man to deceive.",
    "I said slowly It was  in a way  rather beastly.",
    "He nodded.",
    "One doesnt really believe in it said Despard.",
    "Not with ones\nreasoning mind  but these things have their effect.",
    "Ive seen a good\ndeal of it in East Africa.",
    "The witch doctors there have a terrific hold\non the people and one has to admit that odd things happen which\ncant be explained in any rational manner.",
    "Deaths\n\nOh yes.",
    "If a man knows hes been marked down to die he dies.",
    "The power of suggestion I suppose.",
    "Presumably.",
    "But that doesnt quite satisfy you\n\nNo  not quite.",
    "There are cases difficult of explanation by any of\nour glib Western scientific theories.",
    "The stuff doesnt usually work\non Europeans though I have known cases.",
    "But if the belief is there\nin your blood youve had it He left it there.",
    "I said thoughtfully I agree with you that one cant be too didactic.",
    "Odd things happen even in this country.",
    "I was at a hospital one day\n\n\fin London.",
    "A girl had come in  neurotic subject complaining of\nterrible pain in bones arms etc.",
    "Nothing to account for it.",
    "They\nsuspected she was a victim of hysteria.",
    "Doctor told her cure could\nbe effected by a redhot rod being drawn down the arm.",
    "Would she\nagree to try it She did.",
    "The girl turned her head away and screwed up her eyes.",
    "The\ndoctor dipped a glass rod in cold water and drew it down the inside\nof her arm.",
    "The girl screamed with agony.",
    "He said Youll be all right\nnow.",
    "She said I expect so but it was awful.",
    "It burned.",
    "The queer\nthing to me was  not that she believed that she had been burned\nbut that her arm actually was burned.",
    "The flesh was actually\nblistered everywhere the rod had touched it.",
    "Was she cured Despard asked curiously.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "The neuritis or whatever it was never reappeared.",
    "She\nhad to be treated for the burned arm though.",
    "Extraordinary said Despard.",
    "It goes to show doesnt it\n\nThe doctor was startled himself.",
    "I bet he was...",
    "He looked at me curiously.",
    "Why were you really so keen to go to that s\u0439ance last night\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.",
    "Those three women intrigue me.",
    "I wanted to see what sort of show\nthey would put up.",
    "Despard said no more.",
    "I dont think he believed me.",
    "As I have said\nhe was a perceptive man.",
    "Presently I went along to the vicarage.",
    "The door was open but there\nseemed to be no one in the house.",
    "I went to the little room where the telephone was and rang up\nGinger.",
    "It seemed an eternity before I heard her voice.",
    "Hallo\n\nGinger\n\nOh its you.",
    "What happened\n\nYoure all right\n\nOf course Im all right.",
    "Why shouldnt I be\n\nWaves of relief swept over me.",
    "There was nothing wrong with Ginger the familiar challenge of her\nmanner did me a world of good.",
    "How could I ever have believed that\na lot of mumbo jumbo could hurt so normal a creature as Ginger\n\n\fI just thought you might have had bad dreams or something I said\nrather lamely.",
    "Well I didnt.",
    "I expected to have but all that happened was that I\nkept waking up and wondering if I felt anything peculiar happening\nto me.",
    "I really felt almost indignant because nothing did happen to\nme.",
    "I laughed.",
    "But go on  tell me said Ginger.",
    "Whats it all about\n\nNothing much out of the ordinary.",
    "Sybil lay on a purple couch and\nwent into a trance.",
    "Ginger gave a spurt of laughter.",
    "Did she How wonderful Was it a black velvet one and did she\nhave nothing on\n\nSybil is no Madame de Montespan.",
    "And it wasnt a black mass.",
    "Actually Sybil wore quite a lot of clothes peacock blue and lots of\nembroidered symbols.",
    "Sounds most appropriate and Sybillike.",
    "What did Bella do\n\nThat really was rather beastly.",
    "She killed a white cock and then\nthey dipped your glove in the blood.",
    "Oo  nasty... what else\n\n\fLots of things I said.",
    "I thought that I was doing quite well.",
    "I went on\n\nThyrza gave me the whole bag of tricks.",
    "Summoned up a spirit Macandal was I think the name.",
    "And there were coloured lights\nand chanting.",
    "The whole thing would have been quite impressive to\nsome people  scared em out of their wits.",
    "But it didnt scare you\n\nBella did scare me a bit I said.",
    "She had a very nastylooking\nknife and I thought she might lose her head and add me to the cock\nas a second victim.",
    "Ginger persisted\n\nNothing else frightened you\n\nIm not influenced by that sort of thing.",
    "Then why did you sound so thankful to hear I was all right\n\nWell because  I stopped.",
    "All right said Ginger obligingly.",
    "You neednt answer that one.",
    "And you neednt go out of your way to play down the whole thing.",
    "Something about it impressed you.",
    "Only I think because they  Thyrza I mean  seemed so calmly\nconfident of the result.",
    "Confident that what youve been telling me about could actually kill\na person\n\nGingers voice was incredulous.",
    "Its daft I agreed.",
    "Wasnt Bella confident too\n\nI considered.",
    "I said\n\nI think Bella was just enjoying herself killing cocks and working\nherself up into a kind of orgy of ill wishing.",
    "To hear her moaning out\nThe Blood... he blood was really something.",
    "I wish Id heard it said Ginger regretfully.",
    "I wish you had I said.",
    "Frankly the whole thing was quite a\nperformance.",
    "Youre all right now arent you said Ginger.",
    "What do you mean  all right\n\nYou werent when you rang me up but you are now.",
    "She was quite correct in her assumption.",
    "The sound of her cheerful\nnormal voice had done wonders for me.",
    "Secretly though I took off\nmy hat to Thyrza Grey.",
    "Bogus though the whole business might\nhave been it had infected my mind with doubt and apprehension.",
    "But nothing mattered now Ginger was all right.",
    "She hadnt had so\nmuch as a bad dream.",
    "And what do we do next demanded Ginger.",
    "Have I got to stay\nput for another week or so\n\nIf I want to collect a hundred pounds from Mr Bradley yes.",
    "Youll do that if its the last thing you ever do.",
    "Are you staying on\nwith Rhoda\n\nFor a bit.",
    "Then Ill move on to Bournemouth.",
    "Youre to ring me\nevery day mind or Ill ring you  thats better.",
    "Im ringing from the\nvicarage now.",
    "Hows Mrs Dane Calthrop\n\nIn great form.",
    "I told her all about it by the way.",
    "I thought you would.",
    "Well goodbye for now.",
    "Life is going to be\nvery boring for the next week or two.",
    "Ive brought some work with\nme to do  and a good many of the books that one always means to\nread but never has the time to.",
    "What does your gallery think\n\n\fThat Im on a cruise.",
    "Dont you wish you were\n\nNot really said Ginger...",
    "Her voice was a little odd.",
    "No suspicious characters approached you\n\nOnly what you might expect.",
    "The milkman the man to read the gas\nmeter a woman asking me what patent medicines and cosmetics I\nused someone asking me to sign a petition to abolish nuclear\nbombs and a woman who wanted a subscription for the blind.",
    "Oh\nand the various flat porters of course.",
    "Very helpful.",
    "One of them\nmended a fuse for me.",
    "Seems harmless enough I commented.",
    "What were you expecting\n\nI dont really know.",
    "I had wished I suppose for something overt that I could tackle.",
    "But the victims of the Pale Horse died of their own free will... no the\nword free was not the one to use.",
    "Seeds of physical weakness in\nthem were developed by a process that I did not understand.",
    "Ginger rebuffed a weak suggestion of mine about a false gas meter\nman.",
    "He had genuine credentials she said.",
    "I asked for them He was\nonly the man who gets up on a ladder inside the bathroom and\nreads off the figures and writes them down.",
    "Hes far too grand to\ntouch pipes or gas jets.",
    "And I can assure you he hasnt arranged an\nescape of gas in my bedroom.",
    "No the Pale Horse did not deal with accidental gas escapes nothing so concrete\n\nOh I had one other visitor said Ginger.",
    "Your friend Dr Corrigan.",
    "Hes nice.",
    "I suppose Lejeune sent him.",
    "He seemed to think he ought to rally to a namesake.",
    "Up the\nCorrigans\n\nI rang off much relieved in mind.",
    "I got back to find Rhoda busy on the lawn with one of her dogs.",
    "She\nwas anointing it with some unguent.",
    "The vets just gone she said.",
    "He says its ringworm.",
    "Its\nfrightfully catching I believe.",
    "I dont want the children getting it  or\nthe other dogs.",
    "Or even adult human beings I suggested.",
    "Oh its usually children who get it.",
    "Thank goodness theyre away\nat school all day  keep quiet Sheila.",
    "Dont wriggle.",
    "This stuff makes the hair fall out she went on.",
    "It leaves bald\nspots for a bit but it grows again.",
    "I nodded offered to help was refused for which I was thankful and\nwandered off again.",
    "The curse of the country I have always thought is that there are\nseldom more than three directions in which you can go for a walk.",
    "In Much Deeping you could either take the Garsington road or the\nroad to Long Cottenham or you could go up Shadhanger Lane to\nthe main London  Bournemouth road two miles away.",
    "By the following day at lunchtime I had sampled both the\nGarsington and the Long Cottenham roads.",
    "Shadhanger Lane was\nthe next prospect.",
    "I started off and on my way was struck by an idea.",
    "The entrance to\nPriors Court opened off Shadhanger Lane.",
    "Why should I not go and\ncall on Mr Venables\n\nThe more I considered the idea the more I liked it.",
    "There would be\nnothing suspicious about my doing so.",
    "When I had been staying\ndown here before Rhoda had taken me over there.",
    "It would be easy\nand natural to call and ask if I might be shown again some\nparticular object that I had not had time really to look at and enjoy\non that occasion.",
    "The recognition of Venables by this chemist  what was his name Ogden  Osborne  was interesting to say the least of it.",
    "Granted\n\n\fthat according to Lejeune it would have been quite impossible for\nthe man in question to have been Venables owing to the latters\ndisability yet it was intriguing that a mistake should have been\nmade about a man living in this particular neighbourhood  and a\nman one had to admit who fitted in so well in character.",
    "There was something mysterious about Venables.",
    "I had felt it from\nthe first.",
    "He had I was sure firstclass brains.",
    "And there was\nsomething about him  what word could I use  the word vulpine\ncame to me.",
    "Predatory  destructive.",
    "A man perhaps too clever to\nbe a killer himself  but a man who could organize killing very well if\nhe wanted to.",
    "As far as all that went I could fit Venables into the part perfectly.",
    "The mastermind behind the scenes.",
    "But this chemist Osborne had\nclaimed that he had seen Venables walking along a London street.",
    "Since that was impossible then the identification was worthless\nand the fact that Venables lived in the vicinity of the Pale Horse\nmeant nothing.",
    "All the same I thought I would like to have another look at Mr\nVenables.",
    "So in due course I turned in at the gates of Priors Court\nand walked up the quarter mile of winding drive.",
    "The same manservant answered the door and said that Mr\nVenables was at home.",
    "Excusing himself for leaving me in the hall\nMr Venables is not always well enough to see visitors he went\naway returning a few moments later with the information that Mr\nVenables would be delighted to see me.",
    "Venables gave me a most cordial welcome wheeling his chair\nforward and greeting me quite as an old friend.",
    "Very nice of you to look me up my dear fellow.",
    "I heard you were\ndown here again and was going to ring up our dear Rhoda this\nevening and suggest you all come over for lunch or dinner.",
    "I apologized for dropping in as I had but said that it was a sudden\nimpulse.",
    "I had gone for a walk found that I was passing his gate\nand decided to gatecrash.",
    "As a matter of fact I said Id love to have another look at your\nMogul miniatures.",
    "I hadnt nearly enough time to see them properly\nthe other day.",
    "Of course you hadnt.",
    "Im glad you appreciate them.",
    "Such exquisite\ndetail.",
    "Our talk was entirely technical after this.",
    "I must admit that I enjoyed\nenormously having a closer look at some of the really wonderful\nthings he had in his possession.",
    "Tea was brought in and he insisted that I partake of it.",
    "Tea is not one of my favourite meals but I appreciated the smoky\nChina tea and the delicate cups in which it was served.",
    "There was\nhot buttered anchovy toast and a plum cake of the luscious oldfashioned kind that took me back to teatime at my grandmothers\nhouse when I was a little boy.",
    "Homemade I said approvingly.",
    "Naturally A bought cake never comes into this house.",
    "You have a wonderful cook I know.",
    "Dont you find it difficult to\nkeep a staff in the country as far away from things as you are\nhere\n\nVenables shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I must have the best.",
    "I insist\nupon it.",
    "Naturally  one has to pay I pay.",
    "All the natural arrogance of the man showed here.",
    "I said dryly If\none is fortunate enough to be able to do that it certainly solves\nmany problems.",
    "It all depends you know on what one wants out of life.",
    "If ones\ndesires are strong enough  that is what matters.",
    "So many people\nmake money without a notion of what they want it to do for them As\na result they get entangled in what one might call the moneymaking machine.",
    "They are slaves.",
    "They go to their offices early and\nleave late they never stop to enjoy.",
    "And what do they get for it\nLarger cars bigger houses more expensive mistresses or wives and let me say bigger headaches.",
    "He leaned forward.",
    "Just the getting of money  that is really the beall and endall for\nmost rich men.",
    "Plough it back into bigger enterprises make more\nmoney still.",
    "But why Do they ever stop to ask themselves why\nThey dont know.",
    "And you I asked.",
    "I  He smiled.",
    "I knew what I wanted.",
    "Infinite leisure in which to\ncontemplate the beautiful things of this world natural and artificial.",
    "Since to go and see them in their natural surroundings has of late\nyears been denied me I have them brought from all over the world\nto me.",
    "But money still has to be got before that can happen.",
    "Yes one must plan ones coups  and that involves quite a lot of\nplanning  but there is no need really no need nowadays to serve\nany sordid apprenticeship.",
    "I dont know if I quite understand you.",
    "Its a changing world Easterbrook.",
    "It always has been but now\nthe changes come more rapidly.",
    "The tempo has quickened  one\nmust take advantage of that.",
    "A changing world I said thoughtfully.",
    "It opens up new vistas.",
    "I said apologetically\n\nIm afraid you know that youre talking to a man whos face is set\nin the opposite direction  towards the past  not towards the\nfuture.",
    "Venables shrugged his shoulders.",
    "The future Who can foresee that I speak of today  now  the\nimmediate moment I take no account of anything else.",
    "The new\ntechniques are here to use.",
    "Already we have machines that can\nsupply us with the answer to questions in seconds  compared to\nhours or days of human labour.",
    "Computers The electronic brain\n\nThings of that kind.",
    "Will machines take the place of men eventually\n\nOf men yes.",
    "Men who are only units of manpower  that is.",
    "But\nMan no.",
    "There has to be Man the Controller Man the Thinker who\nworks out the questions to ask the machines.",
    "I shook my head doubtfully.",
    "Man the Superman I put a faint inflection of ridicule into my\nvoice.",
    "Why not Easterbrook Why not Remember we know  or are\nbeginning to know  something about Man the human animal.",
    "The\npractice of what is sometimes incorrectly called brainwashing has\nopened up enormously interesting possibilities in that direction.",
    "Not\nonly the body but the mind of man responds to certain stimuli.",
    "A dangerous doctrine I said.",
    "Dangerous\n\nDangerous to the doctored man.",
    "Venables shrugged his shoulders.",
    "All life is dangerous.",
    "We forget that we who have been reared in\none of the small pockets of civilization.",
    "For that is all that civilization\nreally is.",
    "Easterbrook.",
    "Small pockets of men here and there who\nhave gathered together for mutual protection and who thereby are\nable to outwit and control Nature.",
    "They have beaten the jungle  but\nthat victory is only temporary.",
    "At any moment the jungle will once\nmore take command.",

    "Life is always\ndangerous  never forget that.",
    "In the end perhaps not only great\nnatural forces but the work of our own hands may destroy it.",
    "We\nare very near to that happening at this moment.",
    "No one can deny that certainly.",
    "But Im interested in your theory\nof power  power over mind.",
    "Oh that  Venables looked suddenly embarrassed.",
    "Probably I\nexaggerated.",
    "I found his embarrassment and partial withdrawal of his former\nclaim interesting.",
    "Venables was a man who lived much alone.",
    "A\n\n\fman who is alone develops the need to talk  to someone  anyone.",
    "Venables had talked to me  and perhaps not wisely.",
    "Man the Superman I said.",
    "Youve rather sold me on some\nmodern version of the idea you know.",
    "Theres nothing new about it certainly.",
    "The formula of the\nSuperman goes back a long way.",
    "Whole philosophies have been\nbuilt on it.",
    "Of course.",
    "But it seems to me that your Superman is a Superman\nwith a difference... a man who could wield power  and never be\nknown to wield power.",
    "A man who sits in his chair and pulls the\nstrings.",
    "I looked at him as I spoke.",
    "He smiled.",
    "Are you casting me for the part.",
    "Easterbrook I wish it were\nindeed so.",
    "One needs something to compensate for  this\n\nHis hand struck down on the rug across his knees and I heard the\nsudden sharp bitterness of his voice.",
    "I wont offer you my sympathy I said.",
    "Sympathy is very little\ngood to a man in your position.",
    "But let me say that if we are\nimagining such a character  a man who can turn unforeseen\ndisaster into triumph  you would be in my opinion exactly that\ntype of man.",
    "He laughed easily.",
    "Youre flattering me.",
    "But he was pleased I saw that.",
    "No I said.",
    "I have met enough people in my life to recognize the\nunusual the extragifted man when I meet him.",
    "I was afraid of going too far but can one ever really go too far with\nflattery A depressing thought One must take it to heart and avoid\nthe pitfall oneself.",
    "I wonder he said thoughtfully what actually makes you say\nthat All this He swept a careless hand round the room.",
    "That is a proof I said that you are a rich man who knows how to\nbuy wisely who has appreciation and taste.",
    "But I feel that there is\nmore to it than mere possession.",
    "You set out to acquire beautiful\nand interesting things  and you have practically hinted that they\nwere not acquired through the medium of laborious toil.",
    "Quite right Easterbrook quite right.",
    "As I said only the fool toils.",
    "One must think plan the campaign in every detail.",
    "The secret of all\nsuccess is something quite simple  but it has to be thought of\nSomething simple.",
    "One thinks of it one puts it into execution  and\nthere you are\n\nI stared at him.",
    "Something simple  something as simple as the\nremoval of unwanted persons Fulfilling a need.",
    "An action\nperformed without danger to anybody except the victim.",
    "Planned by\n\n\fMr Venables sitting in his wheelchair with his great hooked nose\nlike the beak of a bird of prey and his prominent Adams apple\nmoving up and down.",
    "Executed by whom\n\nThyrza Grey\n\nI watched him as I said\n\nAll this talk of remote control reminds me of something that odd\nMiss Grey said.",
    "Ah our dear Thyrza His tone was smooth indulgent but had\nthere been a faint flicker of the eyelids.",
    "Such nonsense as those\ntwo dear ladies talk And they believe it you know they really\nbelieve it Have you been yet  Im sure theyll insist on your going to one of these ridiculous s\u0439ances of theirs\n\nI had a momentary hesitation while I decided rapidly what my\nattitude here ought to be.",
    "Yes I said I  I did go to a s\u0439ance.",
    "And you found it great nonsense Or were you impressed\n\nI avoided his eyes and presented to my best ability a man who is ill\nat ease.",
    "I  oh well  of course I didnt really believe in any of it They seem\nvery sincere but  I looked at my watch.",
    "Id no idea it was so late.",
    "I\nmust hurry back.",
    "My cousin will wonder what I am doing.",
    "You have been cheering up an invalid on a dull afternoon.",
    "My\nregards to Rhoda.",
    "We must arrange another luncheon party soon.",
    "Tomorrow I am going to London.",
    "There is an interesting sale at\nSothebys.",
    "Medieval French ivories.",
    "Exquisite You will appreciate\nthem I am sure if I succeed in acquiring them.",
    "We parted on this amicable note.",
    "Was there an amused and\nmalicious twinkle in his eye as he registered my awkwardness over\nthe s\u0439ance I thought so but I could not be sure.",
    "I felt it quite likely\nthat I was now imagining things.",
    "Chapter 19\n\nI went out into the late afternoon.",
    "Darkness had already fallen and\nsince the sky was overcast I moved rather uncertainly down the\nwinding drive.",
    "I looked back once at the lighted windows of the\nhouse.",
    "In doing so I stepped off the gravel onto the grass and\ncollided with someone moving in the opposite direction.",
    "It was a small man solidly made.",
    "We exchanged apologies.",
    "His\nvoice was a rich deep bass with a rather fruity and pedantic tone.",
    "Im so sorry...\n\nNot at all.",
    "Entirely my fault I assure you...",
    "I have never been here before I explained so I dont quite know\nwhere Im going.",
    "I ought to have brought a torch.",
    "Allow me.",
    "The stranger produced a torch from his pocket switched it on and\nhanded it to me.",
    "By its light I saw that he was a man of middle age\nwith a round cherubic face a black moustache and spectacles.",
    "He\nwore a good quality dark raincoat and can only be described as the\nacme of respectability.",
    "All the same it did just cross my mind to\nwonder why he was not using his torch himself since he had it with\nhim.",
    "Ah I said rather idiotically I see.",
    "I have stepped off the drive.",
    "I stepped back onto it then offered him back the torch.",
    "I can find my way now.",
    "No no pray keep it until you get to the gate.",
    "But you  you are going to the house\n\nNo no.",
    "I am going the same way that you are.",
    "Er  down the drive.",
    "And then up to the bus stop.",
    "I am catching a bus back to\nBournemouth.",
    "I said I see and we fell into step side by side.",
    "My companion\nseemed a little ill at ease.",
    "He inquired if I also were going to the bus\nstop.",
    "I replied that I was staying in the neighbourhood.",
    "There was again a pause and I could feel my companions\nembarrassment growing.",
    "He was the kind of man who does not like\nfeeling in any way in a false position.",
    "You have been to visit Mr Venables he asked clearing his throat.",
    "I said that that was so adding I took it that you also were on your\nway to the house\n\nNo he said.",
    "No... as a matter of fact  He paused.",
    "I live in\nBournemouth  or at least near Bournemouth.",
    "I have just moved into\na small bungalow there.",
    "I felt a faint stirring in my mind.",
    "What had I recently heard about a\nbungalow at Bournemouth While I was trying to remember my\ncompanion becoming even more ill at ease was finally impelled to\nspeak.",
    "You must think it very odd  I admit of course it is odd  to find\nsomeone wandering in the grounds of a house when the  er person in question is not acquainted with the owner of the house.",
    "My reasons are a little difficult to explain though I assure you that I\nhave reasons.",
    "But I can only say that although I have only recently\nsettled in Bournemouth I am quite wellknown there and I could\nbring forward several esteemed residents to vouch for me\npersonally.",
    "Actually I am a pharmacist who has recently sold an\nold established business in London and I have retired to this part of\nthe world which I have always found very pleasant  very pleasant\nindeed.",
    "Enlightenment came to me.",
    "I thought I knew who the little man was.",
    "Meanwhile he was continuing in full spate.",
    "My name is Osborne Zachariah Osborne and as I say I have  had\nrather  a very nice business in London  Barton Street  Paddington\nGreen.",
    "Quite a good neighbourhood in my fathers time but sadly\nchanged now  oh yes very much changed.",
    "Gone down in the\nworld.",
    "He sighed and shook his head.",
    "Then he resumed\n\nThis is Mr Venables house is it not I suppose  er  he is a friend\nof yours\n\nI said with deliberation\n\nHardly a friend.",
    "I have only met him once before today when I was\ntaken to lunch with him by some friends of mine.",
    "Ah yes  I see... yes precisely.",
    "We had come now to the entrance gates.",
    "We passed through them.",
    "Mr Osborne paused irresolutely.",
    "I handed him back his torch.",
    "Thank you I said.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Youre welcome.",
    "I  He paused then words came from\nhim in a rush.",
    "I shouldnt like you to think...",
    "I mean technically of course I was\ntrespassing.",
    "But not I assure you from any motive of vulgar\ncuriosity.",
    "It must have seemed to you most peculiar  my position and open to misconstruction.",
    "I really would like to explain  to  er clarify my position.",
    "I waited.",
    "It seemed the best thing to do.",
    "My curiosity vulgar or not\nwas certainly aroused.",
    "I wanted it satisfied.",
    "Mr Osborne was silent for about a minute then he made up his\nmind.",
    "I really would like to explain to you Mr  er \n\nEasterbrook.",
    "Mark Easterbrook.",
    "Mr Easterbrook.",
    "As I say I would welcome the chance of\nexplaining my rather odd behaviour.",
    "If you have the time It is only\nfive minutes walk up the lane to the main road.",
    "There is quite a\nrespectable little caf\u0439 at the gas station close to the bus stop.",
    "My\nbus is not due for over twenty minutes.",
    "If you would allow me to\noffer you a cup of coffee\n\nI accepted.",
    "We walked up the lane together.",
    "Mr Osborne his\nanguished respectability appeased chatted cosily of the amenities\nof Bournemouth its excellent climate its concerts and the nice\nclass of people who lived there.",
    "We reached the main road.",
    "The gas station was on the corner with\nthe bus stop just beyond it.",
    "There was a small clean caf\u0439 empty\nexcept for a young couple in a corner.",
    "We entered and Mr Osborne\nordered coffee and biscuits for two.",
    "Then he leaned forward across the table and unburdened himself.",
    "This all stems from a case you may have seen reported in the\nnewspapers some time ago.",
    "It was not a very sensational case so it\ndid not make the headlines  if that is the correct expression.",
    "It\nconcerned the Roman Catholic parish priest of the district in\nLondon where I have  had  my shop.",
    "He was set upon one night\nand killed.",
    "Very distressing.",
    "Such happenings are far too frequent\nnowadays.",
    "He was I believe a good man  though I myself do not\nhold with the Roman doctrine.",
    "However that may be I must explain\nmy particular interest.",
    "There was a police announcement that they\nwere anxious to interview anyone who had seen Father Gorman on\nthe night in question.",
    "By chance I had happened to be standing\noutside the door of my establishment that evening about eight\noclock and had seen Father Gorman go by.",
    "Following him at a\nshort distance was a man whose appearance was unusual enough\nto attract my attention.",
    "At the time of course I thought nothing of\nthe matter but I am an observant man Mr Easterbrook and I have\nthe habit of mentally registering what people look like.",
    "It is quite a\nhobby of mine and several people who have come to my shop have\nbeen surprised when I say to them Ah yes I think you came in for\nthis same preparation last March It pleases them you know to be\nremembered.",
    "Good for business I have found it.",
    "Anyway I\n\n\fdescribed the man I had seen to the police.",
    "They thanked me and\nthat was that.",
    "Now I come to the rather surprising part of my story.",
    "About ten\ndays ago I came over to a church f\u043ate in the little village at the\nbottom of the lane we have just walked up  and what was my\nsurprise to see this same man I have mentioned.",
    "He must have had\nor so I thought an accident since he was propelling himself in a\nwheelchair.",
    "I inquired about him and was told he was a rich local\nresident of the name of Venables.",
    "After a day or two to debate the\nmatter I wrote to the police officer to whom I had made my original\nstatement.",
    "He came down to Bournemouth  Inspector Lejeune was\nhis name.",
    "He seemed sceptical however as to whether this was\nindeed the man I had seen on the night of the murder.",
    "He informed\nme that Mr Venables had been a cripple for some years as a result\nof polio.",
    "I must he said have been misled by a chance\nresemblance.",
    "Mr Osborne came to an abrupt halt.",
    "I stirred the pale fluid in front of\nme and took a cautious sip.",
    "Mr Osborne added three lumps of sugar\nto his own cup.",
    "Well that seems to settle that I said.",
    "Yes said Mr Osborne.",
    "Yes... His voice was markedly\ndissatisfied.",
    "Then he leaned forward again his round bald head\nshining under the electric bulb his eyes quite fanatical behind his\nspectacles.",
    "I must explain a little more.",
    "As a boy Mr Easterbrook a friend of\nmy fathers another pharmacist was called to give evidence in the\ncase of Jean Paul Marigot.",
    "You may remember  he poisoned his\nEnglish wife  an arsenical preparation.",
    "My fathers friend identified\nhim in court as the man who signed a false name in his poison\nregister.",
    "Marigot was convicted and hanged.",
    "It made a great\nimpression on me  I was nine years old at the time  an\nimpressionable age.",
    "It was my great hope that some day I too\nmight figure in a cause c\u0439l\u0438bre and be the instrument of bringing a\nmurderer to justice Perhaps it was then that I began to make a\nstudy of memorizing faces.",
    "I will confess to you Mr Easterbrook\nthough it may seem to you quite ridiculous that for many many\nyears now I have contemplated the possibility that some man\ndetermined to do away with his wife might enter my shop to\npurchase what he needed.",
    "Or I suppose a second Madeleine Smith I suggested.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Alas Mr Osborne sighed that has never happened.",
    "Or\nif so the person in question has never been brought to justice.",
    "That\noccurs I would say more frequently than it is quite comfortable to\nbelieve.",
    "So this identification though not what I had hoped opened\nup at least a possibility that I might be a witness in a murder case\n\nHis face beamed with childish pleasure.",
    "Very disappointing for you I said sympathetically.",
    "Yees.",
    "Again Mr Osbornes voice held that odd note of\ndissatisfaction.",
    "Im an obstinate man Mr Easterbrook.",
    "As the days have passed by\nI have felt more and more sure that I was right.",
    "That the man I saw\nwas Venables and no other.",
    "Oh He raised a hand in protest as I\nwas about to speak.",
    "I know.",
    "It was inclined to be foggy.",
    "I was some\ndistance away  but what the police have not taken into\nconsideration is that I have made a study of recognition.",
    "It was not\njust the features the pronounced nose the Adams apple there is\nthe carriage of the head the angle of the neck on the shoulders.",
    "I\nsaid to myself Come come admit you were mistaken.",
    "But I\ncontinued to feel that I had not been mistaken.",
    "The police said it\nwas impossible.",
    "But was it impossible Thats what I asked myself.",
    "Surely with a disability of that kind \n\nHe stopped me by waving an agitated forefinger.",
    "Yes yes but my experiences under the National Health  Well\nreally it would surprise you what people are prepared to do  and\nwhat they get away with I wouldnt like to say that the medical\nprofession are credulous  a plain case of malingering they will spot\nsoon enough.",
    "But there are ways  ways that a chemist is more\nlikely to appreciate than a doctor.",
    "Certain drugs for instance other\nquite harmlessseeming preparations.",
    "Fever can be induced various rashes and skin irritations  dryness of throat or increase\nof secretions \n\nBut hardly atrophied limbs I pointed out.",
    "Quite quite.",
    "But who says that Mr Venables limbs are atrophied\n\n\fWell  his doctor I suppose\n\nQuite.",
    "But I have tried to get a little information on that point.",
    "Mr\nVenables doctor is in London a Harley Street man  true he was\nseen by the local doctor here when he first arrived.",
    "But that doctor\nhas now retired and gone to live abroad.",
    "The present man has\nnever attended Mr Venables.",
    "Mr Venables goes up once a month to\nHarley Street.",
    "I looked at him curiously.",
    "That still seems to me to present no loophole for er  er \n\nYou dont know the things I know said Mr Osborne.",
    "A humble\nexample will suffice.",
    "Mrs H.  drawing insurance benefits for over a\nyear.",
    "Drew them in three separate places  only in one place she\nwas Mrs C. and in another place Mrs T... Mrs C. and Mrs T. lent her\ntheir cards for a consideration and so she collected the money\nthree times over.",
    "I dont see \n\nSuppose  just suppose  the forefinger was now wiggling\nexcitedly our Mr V. makes contact with a genuine polio case in\npoor circumstances.",
    "He makes a proposition.",
    "The man resembles\nhim let us say in a general kind of way no more.",
    "Genuine sufferer\ncalling himself Mr V. calls in specialist and is examined so that the\ncase history is all correct.",
    "Then Mr V. takes house in country.",
    "Local\nG.P.",
    "wants to retire soon.",
    "Again genuine sufferer calls in doctor is\n\n\fexamined.",
    "And there you are Mr Venables well documented as\npolio sufferer with atrophied limbs.",
    "He is seen locally when he is\nseen in a wheelchair.",
    "His servants would know surely I objected.",
    "His valet.",
    "But supposing it is a gang  the valet is one of the gang.",
    "What could\nbe simpler Some of the other servants too perhaps.",
    "But why\n\nAh said Mr Osborne.",
    "Thats another question isnt it I wont tell\nyou my theory  I expect youd laugh at it.",
    "But there you are  a very\nnice alibi set up for a man who might want an alibi.",
    "He could be\nhere there and everywhere and nobody would know.",
    "Seen walking\nabout in Paddington Impossible Hes a helpless cripple living in\nthe country etc.",
    "Mr Osborne paused and glanced at his watch.",
    "My bus is due.",
    "I must be quick.",
    "I get to brooding about this you\nsee.",
    "Wondered if I could do anything to prove it as you might say.",
    "So I thought Id come out here Ive time on my hands these days.",
    "I\nalmost miss my business sometimes go into the grounds and well not to put too fine a point upon it do a bit of spying.",
    "Not very\nnice youll say  and I agree.",
    "But if its a case of getting at the truth of bringing a criminal to book.",
    "If for instance I spotted our Mr\nVenables having a quiet walk around in the grounds well there you\nare And then I thought If they dont pull the curtains too soon and you may have noticed people dont when daylight saving first\nends  theyve got in the habit of expecting it to be dark an hour\nlater  I might creep up and take a peep.",
    "Walking about his library\n\n\fmaybe never dreaming that anyone would be spying on him Why\nshould he No one suspects him as far as he knows\n\nWhy are you so sure the man you saw that night was Venables\n\nI know it was Venables\n\nHe shot to his feet.",
    "My bus is coming.",
    "Pleased to have met you Mr Easterbrook and\nits a weight off my mind to have explained what I was doing there at\nPriors Court.",
    "I dare say it seems a lot of nonsense to you.",
    "It doesnt altogether I said.",
    "But you havent told me what you\nthink Mr Venables is up to.",
    "Mr Osborne looked embarrassed and a little sheepish.",
    "Youll laugh I dare say.",
    "Everybody says hes rich but nobody\nseems to know how he made his money.",
    "Ill tell you what I think.",
    "I\nthink hes one of those master criminals you read about.",
    "You know plans things and has a gang that carries them out.",
    "It may sound\nsilly to you but I \n\nThe bus had stopped.",
    "Mr Osborne ran for it.",
    "I walked home down the lane very thoughtful... it was a fantastic\ntheory that Mr Osborne had outlined but I had to admit that there\nmight just possibly be something in it.",
    "Chapter 20\n\nRinging up Ginger on the following morning I told her that I was\nmoving to Bournemouth the next day.",
    "Ive found a nice quiet little hotel called heaven knows why the\nDeer Park.",
    "Its got a couple of nice unobtrusive side exits.",
    "I might\nsneak up to London and see you.",
    "You oughtnt to really I suppose.",
    "But I must say it would be rather\nheaven if you did.",
    "The boredom Youve no idea If you couldnt\ncome here I could sneak out and meet you somewhere.",
    "Something suddenly struck me.",
    "Ginger Your voice... its different somehow.",
    "Oh that Its all right.",
    "Dont worry.",
    "But your voice\n\nIve just got a bit of a sore throat or something thats all.",
    "Ginger\n\nNow look Mark anyone can have a sore throat.",
    "Im starting a\ncold I expect.",
    "Or a touch of flu.",
    "Flu Look here dont evade the point.",
    "Are you all right or arent\nyou\n\nDont fuss.",
    "Im all right.",
    "Tell me exactly how youre feeling.",
    "Do you feel as though you might\nbe starting flu\n\nWell  perhaps... aching a bit all over you know the kind of thing \n\nTemperature\n\nWell perhaps a bit of temperature...",
    "I sat there a horrible cold sort of feeling stealing over me.",
    "I was\nfrightened.",
    "I knew too that however much Ginger might refuse to\nadmit it Ginger was frightened also.",
    "Her hoarse voice spoke again.",
    "Mark  dont panic.",
    "You are panicking  and really theres nothing to\npanic about.",
    "Perhaps not.",
    "But weve got to take every precaution.",
    "Ring up your\ndoctor and get him to come and see you.",
    "At once.",
    "All right.",
    "But  hell think Im a terrible fusspot.",
    "Never mind.",
    "Do it Then when hes been ring me back.",
    "After I had rung off I sat for a long time staring at the black\ninhuman outline of the telephone.",
    "Panic  I mustnt give way to\npanic.",
    "There was always flu about at this time of year.",
    "The doctor\nwould be reassuring... perhaps it would be only a slight chill.",
    "I saw\nin my minds eye Sybil in her peacock dress with its scrawled\nsymbols of evil.",
    "I heard Thyrzas voice willing commanding.",
    "On the\nchalked floor Bella chanting her evil spells held up a struggling\nwhite cock.",
    "Nonsense all nonsense... of course it was all superstitious\nnonsense...",
    "The box  not so easy somehow to dismiss the box.",
    "The box\nrepresented not human superstition but a development of\nscientific possibility.",
    "But it wasnt possible  it couldnt be possible\nthat \n\nMrs Dane Calthrop found me there sitting staring at the telephone.",
    "She said at once\n\nWhats happened\n\nGinger I said isnt feeling well.",
    "I wanted her to say that it was all nonsense.",
    "I wanted her to\nreassure me.",
    "But she didnt reassure me.",
    "Thats bad she said.",
    "Yes I think thats bad.",
    "Its not possible I urged.",
    "Its not possible for a moment that they\ncan do what they say\n\nIsnt it\n\nYou dont believe  you cant believe \n\nMy dear Mark said Mrs Dane Calthrop.",
    "Both you and Ginger\nhave already admitted the possibility of such a thing or you\nwouldnt be doing what you are doing.",
    "And our believing makes it worse  makes it more likely\n\nYou dont go so far as believing  you just admit that with\nevidence you might believe.",
    "Evidence What evidence\n\nGingers becoming ill is evidence said Mrs Dane Calthrop.",
    "I hated her.",
    "My voice rose angrily.",
    "Why must you be so pessimistic Its just a simple cold  something\nof that kind.",
    "Why must you persist in believing the worst\n\nBecause if its the worst weve got to face it  not bury our heads in\nthe sand until its too late.",
    "You think that this ridiculous mumbo jumbo works These trances\nand spells and cock sacrifices and all the bag of tricks\n\n\fSomething works said Mrs Dane Calthrop.",
    "Thats what weve\ngot to face.",
    "A lot of it most of it I think is trappings.",
    "Its just to\ncreate atmosphere  atmosphere is important.",
    "But concealed\namongst the trappings there must be the real thing  the thing that\ndoes work.",
    "Something like radio activity at a distance\n\nSomething of that kind.",
    "You see people are discovering things all\nthe time  frightening things.",
    "Some variation of this new knowledge\nmight be adapted by some unscrupulous person for their own\npurposes  Thyrzas father was a physicist you know \n\nBut what What That damned box If we could get it examined If\nthe police \n\nPolice arent very keen on getting a search warrant and removing\nproperty without a good deal more to go on than weve got.",
    "If I went round there and smashed up the damned thing\n\nMrs Dane Calthrop shook her head.",
    "From what you told me the damage if there has been damage\nwas done that night.",
    "I dropped my head in my hands and groaned.",
    "I wish wed never started this damned business.",
    "Mrs Dane Calthrop said firmly Your motives were excellent.",
    "And\nwhats done is done.",
    "Youll know more when Ginger rings back after\nthe doctor has been.",
    "Shell ring Rhodas I suppose.",
    "I took the hint.",
    "Id better get back.",
    "Im being stupid said Mrs Dane Calthrop suddenly as I left.",
    "I\nknow Im being stupid.",
    "Trappings Were letting ourselves be\nobsessed by trappings.",
    "I cant help feeling that were thinking the\nway they want us to think.",
    "Perhaps she was right.",
    "But I couldnt see any other way of thinking.",
    "Ginger rang me two hours later.",
    "Hes been she said.",
    "He seemed a bit puzzled but he says its\nprobably flu.",
    "Theres quite a lot about.",
    "Hes sent me to bed and is\nsending along some medicine.",
    "My temperature is quite high.",
    "But it\nwould be with flu wouldnt it\n\nThere was a forlorn appeal in her hoarse voice under its surface\nbravery.",
    "Youll be all right I said miserably.",
    "Do you hear Youll be all\nright.",
    "Do you feel very awful\n\n\fWell  fever  and aching and everything hurts my feet and my\nskin.",
    "I hate anything touching me... nd Im so hot.",
    "Thats the fever darling.",
    "Listen Im coming up to you Im leaving\nnow  at once.",
    "No dont protest.",
    "All right.",
    "Im glad youre coming Mark.",
    "I dare say  Im not so brave\nas I thought...\n\nII\n\nI rang up Lejeune.",
    "Miss Corrigans ill I said.",
    "What\n\nYou heard me.",
    "Shes ill. Shes called her own doctor.",
    "He says\nperhaps flu.",
    "It may be.",
    "But it may not.",
    "I dont know what you can do.",
    "The only idea that occurs to me is to get some kind of specialist on\nto it.",
    "What kind of specialist\n\nA psychiatrist  or psychoanalyst or psychologist.",
    "A psycho\nsomething.",
    "A man who knows about suggestion and hypnotism and\nbrainwashing and all that kind of thing.",
    "There are people who deal\nin that kind of thing\n\n\fOf course there are.",
    "Yes.",
    "There are one or two Home Office men\nwho specialize in it.",
    "I think youre dead right.",
    "It may be just flu  but\nit may be some kind of psychobusiness about which nothing much\nis known.",
    "Lord Easterbrook this may be just what weve been\nhoping for\n\nI slammed down the receiver.",
    "We might be learning something\nabout psychological weapons  but all that I cared about was\nGinger gallant and frightened.",
    "We hadnt really believed either of\nus  or had we No of course we hadnt.",
    "It had been a game  a\ncops and robbers game.",
    "But it wasnt a game.",
    "The Pale Horse was proving itself a reality.",
    "I dropped my head into my hands and groaned.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nI doubt if I shall ever forget the next few days.",
    "It appears to me now\nas a kind of bewildered kaleidoscope without sequence or form.",
    "Ginger was removed from the flat to a private nursing home.",
    "I was\nallowed to see her only at visiting hours.",
    "Her own doctor I gather was inclined to stand on his high horse\nabout the whole business.",
    "He could not understand what the fuss\nwas\n\nall\n\nabout.",
    "His\n\nown\n\ndiagnosis\n\nwas\n\nquite\n\nclear\n\n\n\nbronchopneumonia following on influenza though complicated by\n\n\fcertain slightly unusual symptoms but that as he pointed out\nhappens all the time.",
    "No case is ever typical.",
    "And some people\ndont respond to antibiotics.",
    "And\n\nof\n\ncourse\n\nall\n\nthat\n\nhe\n\nsaid\n\nwas\n\ntrue.",
    "Ginger\n\nhad\n\nbronchopneumonia.",
    "There was nothing mysterious about the\ndisease from which she was suffering.",
    "She just had it  and had it\nbadly.",
    "I had one interview with the Home Office psychologist.",
    "He was a\nquaint little cock robin of a man rising up and down on his toes\nwith eyes twinkling through very thick lenses.",
    "He asked me innumerable questions half of which I could see no\npoint in whatever but there must have been a point for he nodded\nsapiently at my answers.",
    "He entirely refused to commit himself\nwherein\n\nhe\n\nwas\n\nprobably\n\nwise.",
    "He\n\nmade\n\noccasional\n\npronouncements in what I took to be the jargon of his trade.",
    "He\ntried I think various forms of hypnotism on Ginger but by what\nseemed to be universal consent no one would tell me very much.",
    "Possibly because there was nothing to tell.",
    "I avoided my own friends and acquaintances yet the loneliness of\nmy existence was insupportable.",
    "Finally in an excess of desperation I rang up Poppy at her flower\nshop.",
    "Would she come out and dine with me.",
    "Poppy would love to\ndo so.",
    "I took her to the Fantasie.",
    "Poppy prattled happily and I found her\ncompany very soothing.",
    "But I had not asked her out only for her\nsoothing qualities.",
    "Having lulled her into a happy stupor with\ndelicious food and drink I began a little cautious probing.",
    "It seemed\nto me possible that Poppy might know something without being\nwholly conscious of what it was she knew.",
    "I asked her if she\nremembered my friend Ginger.",
    "Poppy said Of course opening\nher big blue eyes and asked what Ginger was doing nowadays.",
    "Shes very ill I said.",
    "Poor pet.",
    "Poppy looked as concerned as it was possible for her to\nlook which was not very much.",
    "She got herself mixed up with something I said.",
    "I believe she\nasked your advice about it.",
    "Pale Horse stuff.",
    "Cost her a terrible lot\nof money.",
    "Oh exclaimed Poppy eyes wider still.",
    "So it was you\n\nFor a moment or two I didnt understand.",
    "Then it dawned upon me\nthat Poppy was identifying me with the man whose invalid wife was\nthe bar to Gingers happiness.",
    "So excited was she by this revelation\nof our love life that she quite failed to be alarmed by the mention of\nthe Pale Horse.",
    "She breathed excitedly\n\nDid it work\n\n\fIt went a bit wrong somehow.",
    "I added The dog it was that\ndied.",
    "What dog asked Poppy at sea.",
    "I saw that words of one syllable would always be needed where\nPoppy was concerned.",
    "The  er  business seems to have recoiled upon Ginger.",
    "Did you\never hear of that happening before\n\nPoppy never had.",
    "Of course I said this stuff they do at the Pale Horse down in\nMuch Deeping  you know about that dont you\n\nI didnt know where it was.",
    "Down in the country somewhere.",
    "I couldnt quite make out from Ginger what it is they do...",
    "I waited carefully.",
    "Rays isnt it said Poppy vaguely.",
    "Something like that.",
    "From\nouter space she added helpfully.",
    "Like the Russians\n\nI decided that Poppy was now relying on her limited imagination.",
    "Something of that kind I agreed.",
    "But it must be quite dangerous.",
    "I mean for Ginger to get ill like this.",
    "But it was your wife who was to be ill and die wasnt it\n\nYes I said accepting the role Ginger and Poppy had planted on\nme.",
    "But it seems to have gone wrong  backfired.",
    "You mean  Poppy made a terrific mental effort.",
    "Like when you\nplug an electric iron in wrong and you get a shock\n\nExactly I said.",
    "Just like that.",
    "Did you ever know that sort of thing\nhappen before\n\nWell not that way \n\nWhat way then\n\nWell I mean if one didnt pay up  afterwards.",
    "A man I knew\nwouldnt.",
    "Her voice dropped in an awestricken fashion.",
    "He was\nkilled in the tube  fell off the platform in front of a train.",
    "It might have been an accident.",
    "Oh no said Poppy shocked at the thought.",
    "It was THEM.",
    "I poured some more champagne into Poppys glass.",
    "Here I felt in\nfront of me was someone who might be helpful if only you could tear\nout of her the disassociated facts that were flitting about in what\nshe called her brain.",
    "She had heard things said and assimilated\nabout half of them and got them jumbled up and nobody had been\nvery careful what they said because it was only Poppy.",
    "The maddening thing was that I didnt know what to ask her.",
    "If I said\nthe wrong thing she would shut up in alarm like a clam and go dumb\non me.",
    "My wife I said is still an invalid but she doesnt seem any\nworse.",
    "Thats too bad said Poppy sympathetically sipping champagne.",
    "So what do I do next\n\nPoppy didnt seem to know.",
    "You see it was Ginger who  I didnt make any of the arrangements.",
    "Is there anyone I could get at\n\nTheres a place in Birmingham said Poppy doubtfully.",
    "Thats closed down I said.",
    "Dont you know anyone else whod\nknow anything about it\n\nEileen Brandon might know something  but I dont think so.",
    "The introduction of a totally unexpected Eileen Brandon startled\nme.",
    "I asked who Eileen Brandon was.",
    "Shes terrible really said Poppy.",
    "Very dim.",
    "Has her hair very\ntightly permed and never wears stiletto heels.",
    "Shes the end.",
    "She\nadded by way of explanation I was at school with her  but she was\npretty dim then.",
    "She was frightfully good at geography.",
    "Whats she got to do with the Pale Horse\n\nNothing really.",
    "It was only an idea she got.",
    "And so she chucked it\nup.",
    "Chucked what up I asked bewildered.",
    "Her job with C.R.C.",
    "Whats C.R.C.",
    "Well I dont really know exactly.",
    "They just say C.R.C.",
    "Something\nabout Customers Reactions or Research.",
    "Its quite a small show.",
    "And Eileen Brandon worked for them What did she have to do\n\nJust go round and ask questions  about toothpaste or gas stoves\nand what kind of sponges you used.",
    "Too too depressing and dull.",
    "I\nmean who cares\n\nPresumably C.R.C.",
    "I felt a slight pricking of excitement.",
    "It was a woman employed by an association of this kind who had\nbeen visited by Father Gorman on the fatal night.",
    "And  yes  of\ncourse someone of that kind had called on Ginger at the flat.",
    "Here was a link of some kind.",
    "Why did she chuck up her job Because she got bored\n\n\fI dont think so.",
    "They paid quite well.",
    "But she got a sort of idea\nabout it  that it wasnt what it seemed.",
    "She thought that it might be connected in some way with the Pale\nHorse Is that it\n\nWell I dont know.",
    "Something of that kind.",
    "Anyway shes working\nin an Espresso coffee bar off Tottenham Court Road now.",
    "Give me her address.",
    "Shes not a bit your type.",
    "I dont want to make sexual advances to her I said brutally.",
    "I\nwant some hints on Customers Research.",
    "Im thinking of buying\nsome shares in one of those things.",
    "Oh I see said Poppy quite satisfied with this explanation.",
    "There was nothing more to be got out of her so we finished up the\nchampagne and I took her home and thanked her for a lovely\nevening.",
    "II\n\nI tried to ring Lejeune next morning but failed.",
    "However after some\ndifficulty I managed to get through to Jim Corrigan.",
    "What about that psychological pipsqueak you brought along to see\nme Corrigan.",
    "What does he say about Ginger\n\nA lot of long words.",
    "But I rather think Mark that hes truly baffled.",
    "And you know people do get pneumonia.",
    "Theres nothing\nmysterious or out of the way about that.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "And several people we know of whose names were\non a certain list have died of bronchopneumonia gastroenteritis\nbulbar paralysis tumour on the brain epilepsy paratyphoid and\nother wellauthenticated diseases.",
    "I know how you feel.",
    "But what can we do\n\nShes worse isnt she I asked.",
    "Well  yes...\n\nThen somethings got to be done.",
    "Such as\n\nIve got one or two ideas.",
    "Going down to Much Deeping getting\nhold of Thyrza Grey and forcing her by scaring the living daylights\nout of her to reverse the spell or whatever it is.",
    "Well  that might work.",
    "Or  I might go to Venables \n\n\fCorrigan said sharply\n\nVenables But hes out.",
    "How can he possibly have any connection\nwith it Hes a cripple.",
    "I wonder.",
    "I might go there and snatch off that rug affair and see if\nthis atrophied limbs business is true or false\n\nWeve looked into all that \n\nWait.",
    "I ran into that little chemist chap Osborne down in Much\nDeeping.",
    "I want to repeat to you what he suggested to me.",
    "I outlined to him Osbornes theory of impersonation.",
    "That mans got a bee in his bonnet said Corrigan.",
    "Hes the kind\nof man who has always got to be right.",
    "But Corrigan tell me couldnt it be as he said Its possible isnt\nit\n\nAfter a moment or two Corrigan said slowly\n\nYes.",
    "I have to admit its possible... but several people would have\nto be in the know  and would have to be paid very heavily for\nholding their tongues.",
    "What of that Hes rolling in money isnt he Has Lejeune found\nout yet how hes made all that money\n\n\fNo.",
    "Not exactly... Ill admit this to you.",
    "Theres something wrong\nabout the fellow.",
    "Hes got a past of some kind.",
    "The moneys all very\ncleverly accounted for in a lot of ways.",
    "It isnt possible to check up\non it all without an investigation which might take years.",
    "The police\nhave had to do that before  when theyve been up against a\nfinancial crook who has covered his traces by a web of infinite\ncomplexity.",
    "I believe the Inland Revenue has been smelling around\nVenables for some time.",
    "But hes clever.",
    "What do you see him as the head of the show\n\nYes I do.",
    "I think hes the man who plans it all.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "He sounds as though hed have the kind of brains for\nthat I agree.",
    "But surely he wouldnt have done anything so crude as\nkilling Father Gorman himself\n\nHe might have if there was sufficient urgency.",
    "Father Gorman\nmight have had to be silenced before he could pass on what he had\nlearned from that woman about the activities of the Pale Horse.",
    "Besides \n\nI stopped short.",
    "Hallo  you still there\n\nYes I was thinking... just an idea that occurred to me...\n\nWhat was it\n\n\fIve not got it clear yet... just that real safety could only be\nachieved one way.",
    "I havent worked it out yet.",
    "Anyway I must go\nnow.",
    "Ive got a rendezvous at a coffee bar.",
    "Didnt know you were in the Chelsea coffee bar set\n\nIm not.",
    "My coffee bar is in Tottenham Court Road as a matter of\nfact.",
    "I rang off and glanced at the clock.",
    "I started for the door when the telephone rang.",
    "I hesitated.",
    "Ten to one it was Jim Corrigan again ringing back to\nknow more about my idea.",
    "I didnt want to talk to Jim Corrigan just now.",
    "I moved towards the door while the telephone rang on persistently\nnaggingly.",
    "Of course it might be the hospital  Ginger \n\nI couldnt risk that.",
    "I strode across impatiently and jerked the\nreceiver off its hook.",
    "Hallo\n\nIs that you Mark\n\n\fYes who is it\n\nIts me of course said the voice reproachfully.",
    "Listen I want to\ntell you something.",
    "Oh its you.",
    "I recognized the voice of Mrs Oliver.",
    "Look here Im\nin a great hurry got to go out.",
    "Ill ring you back later.",
    "That wont do at all said Mrs Oliver firmly.",
    "Youve got to listen to\nme now.",
    "Its important.",
    "Well youll have to be quick.",
    "Ive got an appointment.",
    "Pooh said Mrs Oliver.",
    "You can always be late for an\nappointment.",
    "Everybody is.",
    "Theyll think all the more of you.",
    "No really Ive got to\n\nListen Mark.",
    "This is important.",
    "Im sure it is.",
    "It must be\n\nI curbed my impatience as best I could glancing at the clock.",
    "Well\n\nMy Milly had tonsillitis.",
    "She was quite bad and shes gone to the\ncountry  to her sister \n\nI gritted my teeth.",
    "Im frightfully sorry about that but really \n\n\fListen.",
    "Ive not begun yet.",
    "Where was I Oh yes.",
    "Milly had to go to\nthe country and so I rang up the agency I always go to  the\nRegency  such a silly name I always think  like a cinema \n\nI really must \n\nAnd said what could they send And they said it was very difficult\njust now  which they always say as a matter of fact  but theyd do\nwhat they could \n\nNever had I found my friend Ariadne Oliver so maddening.",
    "And so this morning a woman came along and who do you think\nshe turned out to be\n\nI cant imagine.",
    "Look \n\nA woman called Edith Binns  comic name isnt it  and you\nactually know her.",
    "No I dont.",
    "I never heard of a woman called Edith Binns.",
    "But you do know her and you saw her not very long ago.",
    "She had\nbeen with that godmother of yours for years.",
    "Lady HeskethDubois.",
    "Oh with her\n\nYes.",
    "She saw you the day you came to collect some pictures.",
    "Well thats all very nice and I expect youre very lucky to find her.",
    "I\nbelieve shes most trustworthy and reliable and all that.",
    "Aunt Min\nsaid so.",
    "But really  now \n\nWait cant you I havent got to the point.",
    "She sat and talked a\ngreat deal about Lady HeskethDubois and her last illness and all\nthat sort of thing because they do love illnesses and death and\nthen she said it.",
    "Said what\n\nThe thing that caught my attention.",
    "She said something like Poor\ndear lady suffering like she did.",
    "That nasty thing on her brain a\ngrowth they say and she in quite good health up to just before.",
    "And pitiful it was to see her in the nursing home and all her hair\nnice thick white hair it was and always blued regular once a\nfortnight to see it coming out all over the pillow.",
    "Coming out in\nhandfuls.",
    "And then Mark I thought of Mary Delafontaine that\nfriend of mine.",
    "Her hair came out.",
    "And I remembered what you told\nme about some girl youd seen in a Chelsea coffee place fighting\nwith another girl and getting her hair all pulled out in handfuls.",
    "Hair\ndoesnt come out as easily as that Mark.",
    "You try  just try to pull\nyour own hair just a little bit of it out by the roots Just try it Youll\nsee.",
    "Its not natural Mark for all these people to have hair that\ncomes out by the roots.",
    "Its not natural.",
    "It must be some special\nkind of new illness  it must mean something.",
    "I clutched the receiver and my head swam.",
    "Things halfremembered scraps of knowledge drew together.",
    "Rhoda and her\n\n\fdogs on the lawn  an article I had read in a medical journal in New\nYork  Of course... of course\n\nI was suddenly aware that Mrs Oliver was still quacking happily.",
    "Bless you I said.",
    "Youre wonderful\n\nI slammed back the receiver then took it off again.",
    "I dialed a\nnumber and was lucky enough this time to get Lejeune straight\naway.",
    "Listen I said is Gingers hair coming out by the roots in\nhandfuls\n\nWell  as a matter of fact I believe it is.",
    "High fever I suppose.",
    "Fever my foot I said.",
    "What Gingers suffering from what theyve\nall suffered from is thallium poisoning.",
    "Please God we may be in\ntime...\n\nChapter 22\n\nAre we in time Will she live\n\nI wandered up and down.",
    "I couldnt sit still.",
    "Lejeune sat watching me.",
    "He was patient and kind.",
    "You can be sure that everything possible is being done.",
    "It was the same old answer.",
    "It did nothing to comfort me.",
    "Do they know how to treat thallium poisoning\n\nYou dont often get a case of it.",
    "But everything possible will be\ntried.",
    "If you ask me I think shell pull through.",
    "I looked at him.",
    "How could I tell if he really believed what he was\nsaying Was he just trying to soothe me\n\nAt any rate theyve verified that it was thallium\n\nYes theyve verified that.",
    "So thats the simple truth behind the Pale Horse.",
    "Poison.",
    "No\nwitchcraft no hypnotism no scientific death rays.",
    "Plain poisoning\nAnd she flung that at me damn her.",
    "Flung it in my face.",
    "Laughing in\nher cheek all the while I expect.",
    "Who are you talking about\n\nThyrza Grey.",
    "That first afternoon when I went to tea there.",
    "Talked\nabout the Borgias and all the buildup of rare and untraceable\npoisons the poisoned gloves and all the rest of it.",
    "Common white\narsenic she said and nothing else.",
    "This was just as simple.",
    "All\nthat hooey The trance and the white cocks and the brazier and the\npentagrams and the voodoo and the reversed crucifix  all that was\nfor the crudely superstitious.",
    "And the famous box was another bit\n\n\fof hooey for the contemporaryminded.",
    "We dont believe in spirits\nand witches and spells nowadays but were a gullible lot when it\ncomes to rays and waves and psychological phenomena.",
    "That\nbox I bet is nothing but a nice little assembly of electrical showoff\ncoloured bulbs and humming valves.",
    "Because we live in daily fear\nof fallout and strontium 90 and all the rest of it were amenable to\nsuggestion along the line of scientific talk.",
    "The whole setup at the\nPale Horse was bogus The Pale Horse was a stalking horse\nneither more nor less.",
    "Attention was to be focused on that so that\nwed never suspect what might be going on in another direction.",
    "The beauty of it was that it was quite safe for them.",
    "Thyrza Grey\ncould boast out loud about what occult powers she had or could\ncommand.",
    "She could never be brought into court and tried for\nmurder on that issue.",
    "Her box could have been examined and\nproved to be harmless.",
    "Any court would have ruled that the whole\nthing was nonsense and impossible And of course thats exactly\nwhat it was.",
    "Do you think theyre all three in it asked Lejeune.",
    "I shouldnt think so.",
    "Bellas belief in witchcraft is genuine I should\nsay.",
    "She believes in her own powers and rejoices in them.",
    "The\nsame with Sybil.",
    "Shes got a genuine gift of mediumship.",
    "She goes\ninto a trance and she doesnt know what happens.",
    "She believes\neverything that Thyrza tells her.",
    "So Thyrza is the ruling spirit\n\nI said slowly\n\n\fAs far as the Pale Horse is concerned yes.",
    "But shes not the real\nbrains of the show.",
    "The real brain works behind the scenes.",
    "He\nplans and organizes.",
    "Its all beautifully dovetailed you know.",
    "Everyone has his or her job and no one has anything on anyone\nelse.",
    "Bradley runs the financial and legal side.",
    "Apart from that he\ndoesnt know what happens elsewhere.",
    "Hes handsomely paid of\ncourse so is Thyrza Grey.",
    "You seemed to have got it all taped to your satisfaction said\nLejeune dryly.",
    "I havent.",
    "Not yet.",
    "But we know the basic necessary fact.",
    "Its the\nsame as it has been through the ages.",
    "Crude and simple.",
    "Just plain\npoison.",
    "The dear old death potion.",
    "What put thallium into your head\n\nSeveral things suddenly came together.",
    "The beginning of the\nwhole business was the thing I saw that night in Chelsea.",
    "A girl\nwhose hair was being pulled out by the roots by another girl.",
    "And\nshe said It didnt really hurt.",
    "It wasnt bravery as I thought it was\nsimple fact.",
    "It didnt hurt.",
    "I read an article on thallium poisoning when I was in America.",
    "A lot\nof workers in a factory died one after the other.",
    "Their deaths were\nput down to astonishingly varied causes.",
    "Amongst them if I\nremember rightly were paratyphoid apoplexy alcoholic neuritis\nbulbar paralysis epilepsy gastroenteritis and so on.",
    "Then there\nwas a woman who poisoned seven people.",
    "Diagnoses included\nbrain tumour encephalitis and lobar pneumonia.",
    "The symptoms\n\n\fvary a good deal I understand.",
    "They may start with diarrhea and\nvomiting or there may be a stage of intoxication again it may begin\nwith pain in the limbs and be put down as polyneuritis or rheumatic\nfever or polio  one patient was put in an iron lung.",
    "Sometimes\ntheres pigmentation of the skin.",
    "You talk like a medical dictionary\n\nNaturally.",
    "Ive been looking it up.",
    "But one thing always happens\nsooner or later.",
    "The hair falls out.",
    "Thallium used to be used for\ndepilation at one time  particularly for children with ringworm.",
    "Then it was found to be dangerous.",
    "But its occasionally given\ninternally but with very careful dosage going by the weight of the\npatient.",
    "Its mainly used nowadays for rats I believe.",
    "Its tasteless\nsoluble and easy to buy.",
    "Theres only one thing poisoning mustnt\nbe suspected.",
    "Lejeune nodded.",
    "Exactly he said.",
    "Hence the insistence by the Pale Horse that the\nmurderer must stay away from his intended victim.",
    "No suspicion of\nfoul play ever arises.",
    "Why should it Theres no interested party\nwho could have had access to food or drink.",
    "No purchase of\nthallium or any other poison is ever made by him or her.",
    "Thats the\nbeauty of it.",
    "The real work is done by someone who has no\nconnection whatever with the victim.",
    "Someone I think who\nappears once and once only.",
    "He paused.",
    "Any ideas on that\n\nOnly one.",
    "A common factor appears to be that on every occasion\nsome pleasant harmlessseeming woman calls with a questionnaire\non behalf of a domestic research unit.",
    "You think that that woman is the one who plants the poison As a\nsample Something like that\n\nI dont think its quite as simple as that I said slowly.",
    "I have an\nidea that the women are quite genuine.",
    "But they come into it\nsomehow.",
    "I think we may be able to find out something if we talk to\na woman called Eileen Brandon who works in an Espresso off\nTottenham Court Road.",
    "II\n\nEileen Brandon had been fairly accurately described by Poppy allowing that is to say for Poppys own particular point of view.",
    "Her\nhair was neither like a chrysanthemum nor an unruly birds nest.",
    "It\nwas waved back close to her head she wore the minimum of\nmakeup and her feet were encased in what are called I believe\nsensible shoes.",
    "Her husband had been killed in a motor accident\nshe told us and left her with two small children.",
    "Before her present\nemployment she had been employed by a firm called Customers\nReactions Classified for over a year.",
    "She had left of her own accord\nas she had not cared for the type of work.",
    "Why didnt you care for it.",
    "Mrs Brandon\n\nLejeune asked the question.",
    "She looked at him.",
    "Youre a detectiveinspector of police Is that right\n\nQuite right Mrs Brandon.",
    "You think theres something wrong about that firm\n\nIts a matter Im inquiring into.",
    "Did you suspect something of the\nkind Is that why you left\n\nIve nothing definite to go upon.",
    "Nothing definite that I could tell\nyou.",
    "Naturally.",
    "We understand that.",
    "This is a confidential inquiry.",
    "I see.",
    "But there is really very little I could say.",
    "You can say why you wanted to leave.",
    "I had a feeling that there were things going on that I didnt know\nabout.",
    "You mean you didnt think that it was a genuine concern\n\nSomething of the kind.",
    "It didnt seem to me to be run in a\nbusinesslike way.",
    "I suspected that there must be some ulterior\nobject behind it.",
    "But what that object was I still dont know.",
    "Lejeune asked more questions as to exactly what work she had\nbeen asked to do.",
    "Lists of names in a certain neighbourhood had\nbeen handed out.",
    "Her job was to visit those people ask certain\nquestions and note down the answers.",
    "And what struck you as wrong about that\n\nThe questions did not seem to me to follow up any particular line of\nresearch.",
    "They seemed desultory almost haphazard.",
    "As though how can I put it  they were a cloak for something else.",
    "Have you any idea what the something else might have been\n\nNo.",
    "Thats what puzzled me.",
    "She paused a moment and then said doubtfully\n\nI did wonder at one time whether the whole thing could have\nbeen organized with a view perhaps to burglaries a spying out of\nthe land so to speak.",
    "But that couldnt be it because I was never\nasked for any description of the rooms fastenings etc.",
    "or when\nthe occupants of the flat or house were likely to be out or away.",
    "What articles did you deal with in the questions\n\nIt varied.",
    "Sometimes it was foodstuffs.",
    "Cereals cake mixes or it\nmight be soap flakes and detergents.",
    "Sometimes cosmetics face\npowder lipsticks creams etc.",
    "Sometimes patent medicines or\n\n\fremedies brands of aspirin cough pastilles sleeping pills pep\npills gargles mouthwashes indigestion remedies and so on.",
    "You were not asked Lejeune spoke casually to supply samples\nof any particular goods\n\nNo.",
    "Nothing of that kind.",
    "You merely asked questions and noted down the answers.",
    "Yes.",
    "What was supposed to be the object of these inquiries\n\nThat was what seemed so odd.",
    "We were never told exactly.",
    "It was\nsupposed to be done in order to supply information to certain\nmanufacturing firms  but it was an extraordinarily amateurish way\nof going about it.",
    "Not systematic at all.",
    "Would it be possible do you think that among the questions you\nwere told to ask there was just one question or one group of\nquestions that was the object of the enterprise and that the others\nmight have been camouflage\n\nShe considered the point frowning a little then she nodded.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "That would account for the haphazard choice  but\nI havent the least idea what question or questions were the\nimportant ones\n\n\fLejeune looked at her keenly.",
    "There must be more to it than what youve told us he said gently.",
    "Thats the point there isnt really.",
    "I just felt there was something\nwrong about the whole setup.",
    "And then I talked to another woman\na Mrs Davis \n\nYou talked to a Mrs Davis  yes\n\nLejeunes voice remained quite unchanged.",
    "She wasnt happy about things either.",
    "And why wasnt she happy\n\nShed overheard something.",
    "What had she overheard\n\nI told you I couldnt be definite.",
    "She didnt tell me in so many\nwords.",
    "Only that from what she had overheard the whole setup\nwas a racket of some kind.",
    "Its not what it seems to be.",
    "That is\nwhat she said.",
    "Then she said Oh well it doesnt affect us.",
    "The\nmoneys very good and were not asked to do anything thats\nagainst the law  so I dont see that we need bother our heads about\nit.",
    "That was all\n\n\fThere was one other thing she said.",
    "I dont know what she meant\nby it.",
    "She said Sometimes I feel like Typhoid Mary.",
    "At the time I\ndidnt know what she meant.",
    "Lejeune took a paper from his pocket and handed it to her.",
    "Do any of the names on that list mean anything to you Did you call\nupon any of them that you can remember\n\nI wouldnt remember.",
    "She took the paper.",
    "I saw so many... She\npaused as her eye went down the list.",
    "She said\n\nOrmerod.",
    "You remember an Ormerod\n\nNo.",
    "But Mrs Davis mentioned him once.",
    "He died very suddenly\ndidnt he Cerebral hemorrhage.",
    "It upset her.",
    "She said He was on\nmy list a fortnight ago.",
    "Looked like a man in the pink of condition.",
    "It\nwas after that that she made the remark about Typhoid Mary.",
    "She\nsaid Some of the people I call on seem to curl up their toes and\npass out just from having one look at me.",
    "She laughed about it and\nsaid it was a coincidence.",
    "But I dont think she liked it much.",
    "However she said she wasnt going to worry.",
    "And that was all\n\nWell \n\nTell me.",
    "It was some time later.",
    "I hadnt seen her for a while.",
    "But we met\none day in a restaurant in Soho.",
    "I told her that Id left the C.R.C.",
    "and\ngot another job.",
    "She asked me why and I told her Id felt uneasy\nnot knowing what was going on.",
    "She said Perhaps youve been\nwise.",
    "But its good money and short hours.",
    "And after all weve all\ngot to take our chance in this life Ive not had much luck in my life\nand why should I care what happens to other people I said I dont\nunderstand what youre talking about.",
    "What exactly is wrong with\nthat show She said I cant be sure but Ill tell you I recognized\nsomeone the other day.",
    "Coming out of a house where hed no\nbusiness to be and carrying a bag of tools.",
    "What was he doing with\nthose Id like to know She asked me too if Id ever come across a\nwoman who ran a pub called the Pale Horse somewhere.",
    "I asked\nher what the Pale Horse had to do with it.",
    "And what did she say\n\nShe laughed and said Read your Bible.",
    "Mrs Brandon added I dont know what she meant.",
    "That was the\nlast time I saw her.",
    "I dont know where she is now whether shes\nstill with C.R.C.",
    "or whether shes left.",
    "Mrs Davis is dead said Lejeune.",
    "Eileen Brandon looked startled.",
    "Dead But how\n\n\fPneumonia two months ago.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "Is there anything else you can tell us Mrs Brandon\n\nIm afraid not.",
    "I have heard other people mention that phrase  the\nPale Horse but if you ask them about it they shut up at once.",
    "They\nlook afraid too.",
    "She looked uneasy.",
    "I  I dont want to be mixed up in anything dangerous Inspector\nLejeune.",
    "Ive got two small children... honestly I dont know\nanything more than Ive told you.",
    "He looked at her keenly then he nodded his head and let her go.",
    "That takes us a little further said Lejeune when Eileen Brandon\nhad gone.",
    "Mrs Davis got to know too much.",
    "She tried to shut her\neyes to the meaning of what was going on but she must have had a\nvery shrewd suspicion of what it was.",
    "Then she was suddenly taken\nill and when she was dying she sent for a priest and told him what\nshe knew and suspected.",
    "The question is how much did she know\nThat list of people I should say is a list of people she had called on\nin the course of her job and who had subsequently died.",
    "Hence the\nremark about Typhoid Mary.",
    "The real question is who was it she\nrecognized coming out of a house where he had no business to be\nand pretending to be a workman of some kind That must have\nbeen the knowledge that made her dangerous.",
    "If she recognized\n\n\fhim he may have recognized her  and he may have realized that\nshe had recognized him.",
    "If shed passed on that particular item to\nFather Gorman then it was vital that Father Gorman should be\nsilenced at once before he could pass it on.",
    "He looked at me.",
    "You agree dont you That must have been the way of it.",
    "Oh yes I said.",
    "I agree.",
    "And youve an idea perhaps who the man is\n\nIve an idea but \n\nI know.",
    "We havent got a particle of evidence.",
    "He was silent a moment.",
    "Then he got up.",
    "But well get him he said.",
    "Make no mistake.",
    "Once we know\ndefinitely who it is there are always ways.",
    "Well try every damned\none of them\n\nChapter 23\n\nIt was some three weeks later that a car drove up to the front door\nof Priors Court.",
    "Four men got out.",
    "I was one of them.",
    "There was also DetectiveInspector Lejeune and DetectiveSergeant Lee.",
    "The fourth man was\nMr Osborne who could hardly contain his delight and excitement at\nbeing allowed to be one of the party.",
    "You must hold your tongue you know Lejeune admonished him.",
    "Yes indeed Inspector.",
    "You can count on me absolutely.",
    "I wont\nutter a word.",
    "Mind you dont.",
    "I feel its a privilege.",
    "A great privilege though I dont quite\nunderstand \n\nBut nobody was entering into explanations at this moment.",
    "Lejeune rang the bell and asked for Mr Venables.",
    "Looking rather like a deputation the four of us were ushered in.",
    "If Venables was surprised at our visit he did not show it.",
    "His\nmanner was courteous in the extreme.",
    "I thought again as he\nwheeled his chair a little back so as to widen the circle round him\nwhat a very distinctive appearance the man had.",
    "The Adams apple\nmoving up and down between the wings of his oldfashioned collar\nthe haggard profile with its curved nose like a bird of prey.",
    "Nice to see you again Easterbrook.",
    "You seem to spend a lot of\ntime down in this part of the world nowadays.",
    "There was a faint malice in his tone I thought.",
    "He resumed\n\nAnd  DetectiveInspector Lejeune is it That rouses my curiosity\nI must admit.",
    "So peaceful in these parts so free from crime.",
    "And\nyet a detectiveinspector calls What can I do for you DetectiveInspector\n\nLejeune was very quiet very suave.",
    "There is a matter on which we think you might be able to assist us\nMr Venables.",
    "That has a rather familiar ring does it not In what way do you\nthink I can assist you\n\nOn October seventh  a parish priest of the name of Father Gorman\nwas murdered in West Street Paddington.",
    "I have been given to\nunderstand that you were in the neighbourhood at that time between sevenfortyfive and eightfifteen in the evening and you\nmay have seen something that may have a bearing on the matter\n\nWas I really in the neighbourhood at that time Do you know I\ndoubt it I very much doubt it.",
    "As far as I can recall I have never\nbeen in that particular district of London.",
    "Speaking from memory I\ndo not even think I was in London at all just then.",
    "I go to London\noccasionally for an interesting day in the sale rooms and now and\nthen for a medical checkup.",
    "With Sir William Dugdale of Harley Street I believe.",
    "Mr Venables stared at him coldly.",
    "You are very well informed Inspector.",
    "Not quite so well as I should like to be.",
    "However Im disappointed\nthat you cant assist me in the way that I hoped.",
    "I think I owe it to\nyou to explain the facts connected with the death of Father\nGorman.",
    "Certainly if you like.",
    "It is a name I have never heard until now.",
    "Father Gorman had been called out on that particular foggy\nevening to the deathbed of a woman nearby.",
    "She had become\nentangled with a criminal organization at first almost unwittingly\nbut later certain things made her suspect the seriousness of the\nmatter.",
    "It was an organization which specialized in the removal of\nunwanted persons  for a substantial fee naturally.",
    "Hardly a new idea murmured Venables.",
    "In America \n\nAh but there were some novel features about this particular\norganization.",
    "To begin with the removals were ostensibly brought\nabout by what might perhaps be called psychological means.",
    "What\nis referred to as a death wish said to be present in everyone is\nstimulated \n\nSo that the person in question obligingly commits suicide It\nsounds if I may say so Inspector too good to be true.",
    "Not suicide Mr Venables.",
    "The person in question dies a perfectly\nnatural death.",
    "Come now.",
    "Come now.",
    "Do you really believe that How very unlike\nour hardheaded police force\n\nThe headquarters of this organization are said to be a place called\nthe Pale Horse.",
    "Ah now I begin to understand.",
    "So that is what brings you to our\npleasant rural neighbourhood my friend Thyrza Grey and her\nnonsense Whether she believes it herself or not Ive never been\nable to make out.",
    "But nonsense it is She has a silly mediumistic\nfriend and the local witch cooks her dinners quite brave to eat\nthem  hemlock in the soup any moment.",
    "And the three old dears\nhave worked up quite a local reputation.",
    "Very naughty of course\nbut dont tell me Scotland Yard or wherever you come from take it\nall seriously\n\nWe take it very seriously indeed Mr Venables.",
    "You really believe that Thyrza spouts some highfalutin nonsense\nSybil throws a trance and Bella does black magic and as a result\nsomebody dies\n\nOh no Mr Venables  the cause of death is simpler than that  He\npaused a moment.",
    "The cause is thallium poisoning.",
    "There was a momentary pause \n\nWhat did you say\n\nPoisoning  by thallium salts.",
    "Quite plain and straightforward.",
    "Only\nit had to be covered up  and what better method of covering up\nthan a pseudoscientific psychological setup  full of modern jargon\nand reinforced by old superstitions.",
    "Calculated to distract attention\nfrom the plain fact of administration of poison.",
    "Thallium.",
    "Mr Venables frowned.",
    "I dont think Ive ever heard of\nit.",
    "No Used extensively as rat poison occasionally as a depilatory\nfor children with ringworm.",
    "Can be obtained quite easily.",
    "Incidentally theres a packet of it tucked away in a corner of your\npotting shed.",
    "In my potting shed It sounds most unlikely.",
    "Its there all right.",
    "Weve examined some of it for testing purposes \n\nVenables became slightly excited.",
    "Someone must have put it there.",
    "I know nothing about it Nothing\nat all.",
    "Is that so Youre a man of some wealth arent you Mr Venables\n\n\fWhat has that got to do with what we are talking about\n\nThe Inland Revenue have been asking some awkward questions\nlately I believe As to source of income that is.",
    "The curse of living in England is undoubtedly our system of\ntaxation.",
    "I have thought very seriously of late of going to live in\nBermuda.",
    "I dont think youll be going to Bermuda just yet a while Mr\nVenables.",
    "Is that a threat Inspector Because if so \n\nNo no Mr Venables.",
    "Just an expression of opinion.",
    "Would you like\nto hear just how this little racket was worked\n\nYou are certainly determined to tell me.",
    "Its very well organized.",
    "Financial details are arranged by a\ndebarred solicitor called Mr Bradley.",
    "Mr Bradley has an office in\nBirmingham.",
    "Prospective clients visit him there and do business.",
    "That is to say there is a bet on whether someone will die within a\nstated period.",
    "Mr Bradley who is fond of a wager is usually\npessimistic in his prognostications.",
    "The client is usually more\nhopeful.",
    "When Mr Bradley wins his bet the money has to be paid\nover promptly  or else something unpleasant is liable to happen.",
    "That is all Mr Bradley has to do  make a bet.",
    "Simple isnt it\n\n\fThe client next visits the Pale Horse.",
    "A show is put on by Miss\nThyrza Grey and her friends which usually impresses him in the\nway it is meant to do.",
    "Now for the simple facts behind the scenes.",
    "Certain women bona fide employees of one of the many consumer\nresearch\n\nconcerns\n\nare\n\ndetailed\n\nto\n\ncanvass\n\na\n\nparticular\n\nneighbourhood with a questionnaire.",
    "What bread do you prefer\nWhat toilet articles and cosmetics What laxative tonics sedatives\nor indigestion mixtures People nowadays are conditioned to\nanswering quizzes.",
    "They seldom object.",
    "And so to  the last step.",
    "Simple bold successful The only action\nperformed by the originator of the scheme in person.",
    "He may be\nwearing a mansionflatporters uniform he may be the man calling\nto read the gas or the electric meter.",
    "He may be a plumber or an\nelectrician or a workman of some kind.",
    "Whatever he is he will have\nwhat appear to be the proper credentials with him if anyone asks to\nsee them.",
    "Most people dont.",
    "Whatever role he is playing his real\nobject is simple  the substitution of a preparation he brings with\nhim for a similar article which be knows by reason of the C.R.C.",
    "questionnaire that his victim uses.",
    "He may tap pipes or examine\nmeters or test water pressure  but that is his real object.",
    "Having\naccomplished it he leaves and is not seen in that neighbourhood\nagain.",
    "And for a few days perhaps nothing happens.",
    "But sooner or later\nthe victim displays symptoms of illness.",
    "A doctor is called in but\nhas no reason to suspect anything out of the ordinary.",
    "He may\n\n\fquestion what food or drink etc.",
    "the patient has taken but he is\nunlikely to suspect the ordinary proprietary article that the patient\nhas taken for years.",
    "And you see the beauty of the scheme Mr Venables The only\nperson who knows what the head of the organization actually does is the head of the organization himself.",
    "There is no one to give him\naway.",
    "So how do you know so much demanded Mr Venables\npleasantly.",
    "When we have suspicions of a certain person there are ways of\nmaking sure.",
    "Indeed Such as\n\nWe neednt go into all of them.",
    "But theres the camera for\ninstance.",
    "All kinds of ingenious devices are possible nowadays.",
    "A\nman can be snapped without his suspecting the fact.",
    "Weve got\nsome excellent pictures for instance of a uniformed flat porter\nand a gas man and so on.",
    "There are such things as false\nmoustaches different dentures etc.",
    "but our man has been\nrecognized quite easily  first by Miss Katherine Corrigan alias Mrs\nMark Easterbrook and also by a woman called Edith Binns.",
    "Recognition is an interesting thing Mr Venables.",
    "For instance this\ngentleman here Mr Osborne is willing to swear he saw you\nfollowing Father Gorman in Barton Street on the night of the\nseventh of October about eight oclock.",
    "And I did see you Mr Osborne leaned forward twitching with\nexcitement.",
    "I described you  described you exactly\n\nRather too exactly perhaps said Lejeune.",
    "Because you didnt\nsee Mr Venables that night when you were standing outside the\ndoorway of your shop.",
    "You werent standing there at all.",
    "You were\nacross the street yourself  following Father Gorman until he turned\ninto West Street and you came up with him and killed him...\n\nMr Zachariah Osborne said\n\nWhat\n\nIt might have been ludicrous.",
    "It was ludicrous The dropped jaw.",
    "The staring eyes...\n\nLet me introduce you Mr Venables to Mr Zachariah Osborne\npharmacist late of Barton Street Paddington.",
    "Youll feel a personal\ninterest in him when I tell you that Mr Osborne who has been under\nobservation for some time was unwise enough to plant a packet of\nthallium salts in your potting shed.",
    "Not knowing of your disability\nhed amused himself by casting you as the villain of the piece and\nbeing a very obstinate as well as a very stupid man he refused to\nadmit hed made a bloomer.",
    "Stupid You dare to call me stupid If you knew  if youd any idea\nwhat Ive done  what I can do  I \n\nOsborne shook and spluttered with rage.",
    "Lejeune summed him up carefully.",
    "I was reminded of a man playing\na fish.",
    "You shouldnt have tried to be so clever you know he said\nreprovingly.",
    "Why if youd just sat back in that shop of yours and\nlet well alone I shouldnt be here now warning you as its my duty\nto do that anything you say will be taken down and \n\nIt was then that Mr Osborne began to scream.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nLook here Lejeune there are lots of things I want to know.",
    "The formalities over I had got Lejeune to myself.",
    "We were sitting\ntogether with two large tankards of beer opposite us.",
    "Yes Mr Easterbrook I gather it was a surprise to you.",
    "It certainly was.",
    "My mind was set on Venables.",
    "You never gave me\nthe least hint.",
    "I couldnt afford to give hints Mr Easterbrook.",
    "You have to play\nthese things close to your chest.",
    "Theyre tricky.",
    "The truth is we\nhadnt a lot to go on.",
    "Thats why we had to stage the show in the\nway we did with Venables cooperation.",
    "We had to lead Osborne\nright up the garden path and then turn on him suddenly and hope to\nbreak him down.",
    "And it worked.",
    "Is he mad I asked.",
    "Id say hes gone over the edge now.",
    "He wasnt to begin with of\ncourse but it does something to you you know.",
    "Killing people.",
    "It\nmakes you feel powerful and larger than life.",
    "It makes you feel\nyoure God Almighty.",
    "But youre not.",
    "Youre only a nasty bit of goods\nthats been found out.",
    "And when that facts presented to you\nsuddenly your ego just cant stand it.",
    "You scream and you rant and\nyou boast of what youve done and how clever you are.",
    "Well you\nsaw him.",
    "I nodded.",
    "So Venables was in on the performance you put up I\nsaid.",
    "Did he like the idea of cooperating\n\nIt amused him I think said Lejeune.",
    "Besides he was impertinent\nenough to say that one good turn deserves another.",
    "And what did he mean by that cryptic remark\n\nWell I shouldnt be telling you this said Lejeune this is off the\nrecord.",
    "There was a big outbreak of bank robberies about eight\nyears ago.",
    "The same technique every time.",
    "And they got away with\nit The raids were cleverly planned by someone who took no part in\nthe actual operation.",
    "That man got away with a lot of money.",
    "We\nmay have had our suspicions who it was but we couldnt prove it.",
    "He was too clever for us.",
    "Especially on the financial angle.",
    "And hes\nhad the sense never to try and repeat his success.",
    "Im not saying\nany more.",
    "He was a clever crook but he wasnt a murderer.",
    "No lives\nwere lost.",
    "My mind went back to Zachariah Osborne.",
    "Did you always suspect\nOsborne I asked.",
    "Right from the beginning\n\nWell he would draw attention to himself said Lejeune.",
    "As I told\nhim if hed only sat back and done nothing wed never have\ndreamed that the respectable pharmacist Mr Zachariah Osborne\nhad anything to do with the business.",
    "But its a funny thing thats\njust what murderers cant do.",
    "There they are sitting pretty safe as\nhouses.",
    "But they cant let well alone.",
    "Im sure I dont know why.",
    "The desire for death I suggested.",
    "A variant of Thyrza Greys\ntheme.",
    "The sooner you forget all about Miss Thyrza Grey and the things\nshe told you the better said Lejeune severely.",
    "No he said\nthoughtfully I think really its loneliness.",
    "The knowledge that\nyoure such a clever chap but that theres nobody you can talk to\nabout it.",
    "You havent told me when you started to suspect him I said.",
    "Well straight away he started telling lies.",
    "We asked for anyone\nwhod seen Father Gorman that night to communicate with us.",
    "Mr\nOsborne communicated and the statement he made was a palpable\nlie.",
    "Hed seen a man following Father Gorman and he described the\nfeatures of that man but he couldnt possibly have seen him across\nthe street on a foggy night.",
    "An aquiline nose in profile he might have\nseen but not an Adams apple.",
    "That was going too far.",
    "Of course\nthat lie might have been innocent enough.",
    "Mr Osborne might just\n\n\fwant to make himself important.",
    "Lots of people are like that.",
    "But it\nmade me focus my attention on Mr Osborne and he was really\nrather a curious person.",
    "At once he started to tell me a lot about\nhimself.",
    "Very unwise of him.",
    "He gave me a picture of someone who\nhad always wanted to be more important than he was.",
    "Hed not\nbeen content to go into his fathers oldfashioned business.",
    "Hed\ngone off and tried his fortunes on the stage but he obviously hadnt\nbeen a success.",
    "Probably I should say because he couldnt take\ndirection.",
    "Nobody was going to dictate to him the way he should\nplay a part He was probably genuine enough when he told of his\nambition to be a witness in a murder trial successfully identifying a\nman who had come in to buy poison.",
    "His mind ran on those lines a\ngood deal I should think.",
    "Of course we dont know at what point\nand when the idea occurred to him that he might become a really\nbig criminal a man so clever that he could never be brought to\njustice.",
    "But thats all surmise.",
    "To go back Osbornes description of the\nman he had seen that night was interesting.",
    "It was so obviously a\ndescription of a real person whom he had at one time seen.",
    "Its\nextraordinarily difficult you know to make up a description of\nanybody.",
    "Eyes nose chin ears bearing all the rest of it.",
    "If you try\nit youll find yourself unconsciously describing somebody that\nyouve noticed somewhere  in a tram or a train or an omnibus.",
    "Osborne was obviously describing a man with somewhat unusual\ncharacteristics.",
    "Id say that he noticed Venables sitting in his car\none day in Bournemouth and was struck by his appearance  if hed\nseen him that way he wouldnt realize the man was a cripple.",
    "Another reason that kept me interested in Osborne was that he\nwas a pharmacist.",
    "I thought it just possible that that list we had\nmight tie up with the narcotic trade somewhere.",
    "Actually that\nwasnt so and I might therefore have forgotten all about Mr\nOsborne if Mr Osborne himself hadnt been determined to keep in\nthe picture.",
    "He wanted you see to know just what we were doing\nand so he writes to say that hes seen the man in question at a\nchurch f\u043ate in Much Deeping.",
    "He still didnt know that Mr Venables\nwas a paralysis case.",
    "When he did find that out he hadnt the sense\nto shut up.",
    "That was his vanity.",
    "Typical criminals vanity.",
    "He wasnt\ngoing to admit for one moment that hed been wrong.",
    "Like a fool he\nstuck to his guns and put forward all sorts of preposterous\ntheories.",
    "I had a very interesting visit with him at his bungalow in\nBournemouth.",
    "The name of it ought to have given the show away.",
    "Everest.",
    "Thats what he called it.",
    "And hed hung up a picture of\nMount Everest in the hall.",
    "Told me how interested he was in\nHimalayan exploration.",
    "But that was the kind of cheap joke that he\nenjoyed.",
    "Ever rest.",
    "That was his trade  his profession.",
    "He did give\npeople eternal rest on payment of a suitable fee.",
    "It was a wonderful\nidea ones got to hand him that.",
    "The whole setup was clever.",
    "Bradley in Birmingham Thyrza Grey holding her s\u0439ances in Much\nDeeping.",
    "And who was to suspect Mr Osborne who had no\nconnection with Thyrza Grey no connection with Bradley and\nBirmingham no connection with the victim.",
    "The actual mechanics\nof the thing was childs play to a pharmacist.",
    "As I say if only Mr\nOsborne had had the sense to keep quiet\n\nBut what did he do with the money I asked.",
    "After all he did it for\nmoney presumably\n\n\fOh yes he did it for the money.",
    "Had grand visions no doubt of\nhimself travelling entertaining being a rich and important person.",
    "But of course he wasnt the person he imagined himself to be.",
    "I\nthink his sense of power was exhilarated by the actual performance\nof murder.",
    "To get away with murder again and again intoxicated\nhim and whats more hell enjoy himself in the dock.",
    "You see if he\ndoesnt.",
    "The central figure with all eyes upon him.",
    "But what did he do with the money I demanded.",
    "Oh thats very simple said Lejeune though I dont know that I\nshould have thought of it unless Id noticed the way hed furnished\nthe bungalow.",
    "He was a miser of course.",
    "He loved money and he\nwanted money but not for spending.",
    "That bungalow was sparsely\nfurnished and all with stuff that hed bought cheap at sales.",
    "He\ndidnt like spending money he just wanted to have it.",
    "Do you mean he banked it all\n\nOh no said Lejeune.",
    "Id say well find it somewhere under the\nfloor in that bungalow of his.",
    "Both Lejeune and I were silent for some minutes while I\ncontemplated the strange creature that was Zachariah Osborne.",
    "Corrigan said Lejeune dreamily would say it was all due to\nsome gland in his spleen or his sweetbread or something either\noverfunctioning or underproducing  I never can remember which.",
    "Im a simple man  I think hes just a wrong un.",
    "What beats me  it\n\n\falways does  is how a man can be so clever and yet be such a\nperfect fool.",
    "One imagines a mastermind I said as some grand and sinister\nfigure of evil.",
    "Lejeune shook his head.",
    "Its not like that at all he said.",
    "Evil is not\nsomething superhuman its something less than human.",
    "Your\ncriminal is someone who wants to be important but who never will\nbe important because hell always be less than a man.",
    "Chapter 25\n\nAt Much Deeping everything was refreshingly normal.",
    "Rhoda was\nbusy doctoring dogs.",
    "This time I think it was deworming.",
    "She\nlooked up as I came in and asked me if I would like to assist.",
    "I\nrefused and asked where Ginger was.",
    "Shes gone over to the Pale Horse.",
    "What\n\nShe said she had something to do there.",
    "But the house is empty.",
    "I know.",
    "Shell overtire herself.",
    "Shes not fit yet \n\nHow you fuss Mark.",
    "Gingers all right.",
    "Have you seen Mrs Olivers\nnew book Its called The White Cockatoo.",
    "Its over on the table\nthere.",
    "God bless Mrs Oliver.",
    "And Edith Binns too.",
    "Who on earth is Edith Binns\n\nA woman who has identified a photograph.",
    "Also faithful retainer to\nmy late godmother.",
    "Nothing you say seems to make sense.",
    "Whats the matter with\nyou\n\nI did not reply but set out for the Pale Horse.",
    "Just before I got there I met Mrs Dane Calthrop.",
    "She greeted me enthusiastically.",
    "All along I knew I was being stupid she said.",
    "But I didnt see\nhow.",
    "Taken in by trappings.",
    "She waved an arm towards the inn empty and peaceful in the late\nautumn sunshine.",
    "The wickedness was never there  not in the sense it was\nsupposed to be.",
    "No fantastic trafficking with the Devil no black and\n\n\fevil splendour.",
    "Just parlour tricks done for money  and human life\nof no account.",
    "Thats real wickedness.",
    "Nothing grand or big  just\npetty and contemptible.",
    "You and Inspector Lejeune would seem to agree about things.",
    "I like that man said Mrs Dane Calthrop.",
    "Lets go into the Pale\nHorse and find Ginger.",
    "Whats she doing there\n\nCleaning up something.",
    "We went in through the low doorway.",
    "There was a strong smell of\nturpentine.",
    "Ginger was busy with rags and bottles.",
    "She looked up\nas we entered.",
    "She was still very pale and thin a scarf wound\nround her head where the hair had not yet grown a ghost of her\nformer self.",
    "Shes all right said Mrs Dane Calthrop reading my thoughts as\nusual.",
    "Look said Ginger triumphantly.",
    "She indicated the old inn sign on which she was working.",
    "The grime of years removed the figure of the rider on the horse\nwas plainly discernible a grinning skeleton with gleaming bones.",
    "Mrs Dane Calthrops voice deep and sonorous spoke behind me\n\n\fRevelation Chapter Six Verse Eight.",
    "And I looked and behold a\npale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell\nfollowed with him...\n\nWe were silent for a moment or two and then Mrs Dane Calthrop\nwho was not one to be afraid of anticlimax said\n\nSo thats that in the tone of one who puts something in the\nwastepaper basket.",
    "I must go now she added.",
    "Mothers Meeting.",
    "She paused in the doorway nodded at Ginger and said\nunexpectedly\n\nYoull make a good mother\n\nFor some reason Ginger blushed crimson\n\nGinger I said will you\n\nWill I what Make a good mother\n\nYou know what I mean.",
    "Perhaps... but Id prefer a firm offer.",
    "I made her a firm offer.",
    "After an interlude Ginger demanded\n\nAre you quite sure you dont want to marry that Hermia creature\n\nGood Lord I said.",
    "I quite forgot.",
    "I took a letter from my pocket.",
    "This came three days ago asking me if Id come to the Old Vic with\nher to see Loves Labours Lost.",
    "Ginger took the letter out of my hand and tore it up.",
    "If you want to go to the Old Vic in the future she said firmly\nyoull go with me."
