    "\fAGATHA CHRISTIE\nwriting as\nMARY WESTMACOTT\n\nAbsent in the Spring\n\n\fDedication\nFrom you have I been absent in the Spring \u2026\n\n\n\fChapter One\nJoan Scudamore screwed up her eyes as she peered across the dimness of the rest house\ndiningroom.",
    "She was slightly shortsighted.",
    "Surely that\u2019s \u2013 no it isn\u2019t \u2013 I believe it is.",
    "Blanche Haggard.",
    "Extraordinary \u2013 right out in the wilds \u2013 to come across an old school friend whom she\nhadn\u2019t seen for \u2013 oh quite fifteen years.",
    "At first Joan was delighted by the discovery.",
    "She was by nature a sociable woman\nalways pleased to run across friends and acquaintances.",
    "She thought to herself But poor dear how dreadfully she\u2019s changed.",
    "She looks years\nolder.",
    "Literally years.",
    "After all she can\u2019t be more than \u2013 what fortyeight\nIt was a natural sequence after that to glance at her own appearance in the mirror that\nhappened most conveniently to hang just beside the table.",
    "What she saw there put her in\nan even better humour.",
    "Really thought Joan Scudamore I\u2019ve worn very well.",
    "She saw a slender middleaged woman with a singularly unlined face brown hair\nhardly touched with grey pleasant blue eyes and a cheerful smiling mouth.",
    "The woman\nwas dressed in a neat cool travelling coat and skirt and carried a rather large bag\ncontaining the necessities of travel.",
    "Joan Scudamore was travelling back from Baghdad to London by the overland route.",
    "She had come up by the train from Baghdad last night.",
    "She was to sleep in the railway rest\nhouse tonight and go on by car tomorrow morning.",
    "It was the sudden illness of her younger daughter that had brought her post haste out\nfrom England her realization of William\u2019s her soninlaw impracticability and of the\nchaos that would arise in a household without efficient control.",
    "Well that was all right now.",
    "She had taken charge made arrangements.",
    "The baby\nWilliam Barbara convalescent everything had been planned and set in good running\norder.",
    "Thank goodness thought Joan I\u2019ve always had a head on my shoulders.",
    "William and Barbara had been full of gratitude.",
    "They\u2019d pressed her to stay on not to\nrush back but she had smilingly albeit with a stifled sigh refused.",
    "For there was Rodney\nto consider \u2013 poor old Rodney stuck in Crayminster up to his ears in work and with no\none in the house to look after his comfort except servants.",
    "\u2018And after all\u2019 said Joan \u2018what are servants\u2019\nBarbara said\n\u2018Your servants Mother are always perfection.",
    "You see to that\u2019\nShe had laughed but she had been pleased all the same.",
    "Because when all was said\n\n\fand done one did like appreciation.",
    "She had sometimes wondered if her family took a little\ntoo much for granted the smooth running of the house and her own care and devotion.",
    "Not really that she had any criticism to make.",
    "Tony Averil and Barbara were delightful\nchildren and she and Rodney had every reason to be proud of their upbringing and of their\nsuccess in life.",
    "Tony was growing oranges out in Rhodesia Averil after giving her parents some\nmomentary anxiety had settled down as the wife of a wealthy and charming stockbroker.",
    "Barbara\u2019s husband had a good job in the Public Works Department in Iraq.",
    "They were all nicelooking healthy children with pleasant manners.",
    "Joan felt that she\nand Rodney were indeed fortunate \u2013 and privately she was of the opinion that some of the\ncredit was to be ascribed to them as parents.",
    "After all they had brought the children up\nvery carefully taking infinite pains over the choice of nurses and governesses and later of\nschools and always putting the welfare and wellbeing of the children first.",
    "Joan felt a little gentle glow as she turned away from her image in the glass.",
    "She\nthought Well it\u2019s nice to feel one\u2019s been a success at one\u2019s job.",
    "I never wanted a career or\nanything of that kind.",
    "I was quite content to be a wife and mother.",
    "I married the man I\nloved and he\u2019s been a success at his job \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s owing to me a bit too.",
    "One\ncan do so much by influence.",
    "Dear Rodney\nAnd her heart warmed to the thought that soon very soon she would be seeing\nRodney again.",
    "She\u2019d never been away from him for very long before.",
    "What a happy\npeaceful life they had had together.",
    "Well perhaps peaceful was rather overstating it.",
    "Family life was never quite peaceful.",
    "Holidays infectious illnesses broken pipes in winter.",
    "Life really was a series of petty\ndramas.",
    "And Rodney had always worked very hard harder perhaps than was good for his\nhealth.",
    "He\u2019d been badly run down that time six years ago.",
    "He hadn\u2019t Joan thought with\ncompunction worn quite as well as she had.",
    "He stooped rather and there was a lot of\nwhite in his hair.",
    "He had a tired look too about the eyes.",
    "Still after all that was life.",
    "And now with the children married and the firm doing so\nwell and the new partner bringing fresh money in Rodney could take things more easily.",
    "He and she would have time to enjoy themselves.",
    "They must entertain more \u2013 have a week\nor two in London every now and then.",
    "Rodney perhaps might take up golf.",
    "Yes really\nshe couldn\u2019t think why she hadn\u2019t persuaded him to take up golf before.",
    "So healthy\nespecially when he had to do so much office work.",
    "Having settled that point in her mind Mrs Scudamore looked across the diningroom\nonce more at the woman whom she believed to be her former school friend.",
    "Blanche Haggard.",
    "How she had adored Blanche Haggard when they were at St Anne\u2019s\ntogether Everyone was crazy about Blanche.",
    "She had been so daring so amusing and\nyes so absolutely lovely.",
    "Funny to think of that now looking at that thin restless untidy\nelderly woman.",
    "What extraordinary clothes And she looked \u2013 really she looked \u2013 at least\nsixty \u2026\nOf course thought Joan she\u2019s had a very unfortunate life.",
    "A momentary impatience rose in her.",
    "The whole thing seemed such a wanton waste.",
    "There was Blanche twentyone with the world at her feet \u2013 looks position everything \u2013\nand she had had to throw in her lot with that quite unspeakable man.",
    "A vet \u2013 yes actually\na vet.",
    "A vet with a wife too which made it worse.",
    "Her people had behaved with\ncommendable firmness taking her round the world on one of those pleasure cruises.",
    "And\nBlanche had actually got off the boat somewhere Algiers or Naples and come home and\njoined her vet.",
    "And naturally he had lost his practice and started drinking and his wife\nhadn\u2019t wished to divorce him.",
    "Presently they\u2019d left Crayminster and after that Joan hadn\u2019t\nheard anything of Blanche for years not until she\u2019d run across her one day in London at\nHarrods where they had met in the shoe department and after a little discreet conversation\ndiscreet on Joan\u2019s part Blanche had never set any store by discretion she had discovered\nthat Blanche was now married to a man called Holliday who was in an insurance office\nbut Blanche thought he was going to resign soon because he wanted to write a book about\nWarren Hastings and he wanted to give all his time to it not just write scraps when he\ncame back from the office.",
    "Joan had murmured that in that case she supposed he had private means And Blanche\nhad replied cheerfully that he hadn\u2019t got a cent Joan had said that perhaps to give up his\njob would be rather unwise unless he was sure the book would be a success.",
    "Was it\ncommissioned Oh dear me no said Blanche cheerfully and as a matter of fact she didn\u2019t\nreally think the book would be a success because though Tom was very keen on it he\nreally didn\u2019t write very well.",
    "Whereupon Joan had said with some warmth that Blanche\nmust put her foot down to which Blanche had responded with a stare and a \u2018But he wants\nto write the poor pet.",
    "He wants it more than anything.\u2019 Sometimes Joan said one had to\nbe wise for two.",
    "Blanche had laughed and remarked that she herself had never even been\nwise enough for one\nThinking that over Joan felt that it was only too unfortunately true.",
    "A year later she\nsaw Blanche in a restaurant with a peculiar flashy looking woman and two flamboyantly\nartistic men.",
    "After that the only reminder she had had of Blanche\u2019s existence was five\nyears later when Blanche wrote and asked for a loan of fifty pounds.",
    "Her little boy she\nsaid needed an operation.",
    "Joan had sent her twentyfive and a kind letter asking for\ndetails.",
    "The response was a postcard with scrawled on it Good for you Joan.",
    "I knew you\nwouldn\u2019t let me down \u2013 which was gratifying in a way but hardly satisfactory.",
    "After that\nsilence.",
    "And now here in a Near Eastern railway rest house with kerosene lamps flaring\nand spluttering amidst a smell of rancid mutton fat and paraffin and Flit was the friend of\nso many years ago incredibly aged and coarsened and the worse for wear.",
    "Blanche finished her dinner first and was on her way out when she caught sight of the\nother.",
    "She stopped dead.",
    "\u2018Holy Moses it\u2019s Joan\u2019\nA moment or two later she had pulled up her chair to the table and the two were\nchatting together.",
    "Presently Blanche said\n\u2018Well you\u2019ve worn well my dear.",
    "You look about thirty.",
    "Where have you been all\nthese years In cold storage\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Hardly that.",
    "I\u2019ve been in Crayminster.\u2019\n\u2018Born bred married and buried in Crayminster\u2019 said Blanche.",
    "Joan said with a laugh\n\u2018Is that so bad a fate\u2019\nBlanche shook her head.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 she said seriously.",
    "\u2018I\u2019d say it was a pretty good one.",
    "What\u2019s happened to your\nchildren You had some children didn\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018Yes three.",
    "A boy and two girls.",
    "The boy is in Rhodesia.",
    "The girls are married.",
    "One\nlives in London.",
    "I\u2019ve just been visiting the other one out in Baghdad.",
    "Her name is Wray \u2013\nBarbara Wray.\u2019\nBlanche nodded.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve seen her.",
    "Nice kid.",
    "Married rather too young didn\u2019t she\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so\u2019 said Joan stiffly.",
    "\u2018We all like William very much and they are happy\ntogether.\u2019\n\u2018Yes they seem to be settling down all right now.",
    "The baby has probably been a\nsettling influence.",
    "Having a child does sort of steady a girl down.",
    "Not\u2019 added Blanche\nthoughtfully \u2018that it ever steadied me.",
    "I was very fond of those two kids of mine \u2013 Len\nand Mary.",
    "And yet when Johnnie Pelham came along I went off with him and left them\nbehind without a second thought.\u2019\nJoan looked at her with disapprobation.",
    "\u2018Really Blanche\u2019 she said warmly.",
    "\u2018How could you\u2019\n\u2018Rotten of me wasn\u2019t it\u2019 said Blanche.",
    "\u2018Of course I knew they\u2019d be all right with\nTom.",
    "He always adored them.",
    "He married a really nice domestic girl.",
    "Suited him far better\nthan I ever did.",
    "She saw that he had decent meals and mended his underclothes and all\nthat.",
    "Dear Tom he was always a pet.",
    "He used to send me a card at Christmas and Easter\nfor years afterwards which was nice of him don\u2019t you think\u2019\nJoan did not answer.",
    "She was too full of conflicting thoughts.",
    "The predominant one\nwas wonder that this \u2013 this \u2013 could be Blanche Haggard \u2013 that wellbred highspirited girl\nwho had been the star pupil at St Anne\u2019s.",
    "This really slatternly woman with apparently no\nshame in revealing the more sordid details of her life and in such common language too\nWhy Blanche Haggard had won the prize for English at St Anne\u2019s\nBlanche reverted to a former topic.",
    "\u2018Fancy little Barbara Wray being your daughter Joan.",
    "That just shows how people get\nthings wrong.",
    "Everyone had got it into their heads that she was so unhappy at home that\nshe\u2019d married the first man who asked her in order to escape.\u2019\n\u2018How ridiculous.",
    "Where do these stories come from\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t imagine.",
    "Because I\u2019m pretty sure of one thing Joan and that is that you\u2019ve\nalways been an admirable mother.",
    "I can\u2019t imagine you being cross or unkind.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018That\u2019s nice of you Blanche.",
    "I think I may say that we\u2019ve always given our children a\nvery happy home and done everything possible for their happiness.",
    "I think it\u2019s so\nimportant you know that one should be friends with one\u2019s children.\u2019\n\u2018Very nice \u2013 if one ever can.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I think you can.",
    "It\u2019s just a question of remembering your own youth and putting\nyourself in their place.\u2019 Joan\u2019s charming serious face was bent a little nearer to that of her\nformer friend.",
    "\u2018Rodney and I have always tried to do that.\u2019\n\u2018Rodney Let me see you married a solicitor didn\u2019t you Of course \u2013 I went to their\nfirm at the time when Harry was trying to get a divorce from that awful wife of his.",
    "I\nbelieve it was your husband we saw \u2013 Rodney Scudamore.",
    "He was extraordinarily nice\nand kind most understanding.",
    "And you\u2019ve stayed put with him all these years.",
    "No fresh\ndeals\u2019\nJoan said rather stiffly\n\u2018Neither of us have wanted a fresh deal.",
    "Rodney and I have been perfectly contented\nwith one another.\u2019\n\u2018Of course you always were as cold as a fish Joan.",
    "But I should have said that\nhusband of yours had quite a roving eye\u2019\n\u2018Really Blanche\u2019\nJoan flushed angrily.",
    "A roving eye indeed.",
    "Rodney\nAnd suddenly discordantly a thought slipped and flashed sideways across the\npanorama of Joan\u2019s mind much as she had noticed a snake flash and slip across the dust\ncoloured track in front of the car only yesterday \u2013 a mere streak of writhing green gone\nalmost before you saw it.",
    "The streak consisted of three words leaping out of space and back into oblivion.",
    "The Randolph girl \u2026\nGone again before she had time to note them consciously.",
    "Blanche was cheerfully contrite.",
    "\u2018Sorry Joan.",
    "Let\u2019s come into the other room and have coffee.",
    "I always did have a\nvulgar mind you know.\u2019\n\u2018Oh no\u2019 the protest came quickly to Joan\u2019s lips genuine and slightly shocked.",
    "Blanche looked amused.",
    "\u2018Oh yes don\u2019t you remember Remember the time I slipped out to meet the baker\u2019s\nboy\u2019\nJoan winced.",
    "She had forgotten that incident.",
    "At the time it had seemed daring and \u2013\nyes \u2013 actually romantic.",
    "Really a vulgar and unpleasant episode.",
    "Blanche settling herself in a wicker chair and calling to the boy to bring coffee\nlaughed to herself.",
    "\u2018Horrid precocious little piece I must have been.",
    "Oh well that\u2019s always been my\nundoing.",
    "I\u2019ve always been far too fond of men.",
    "And always rotters Extraordinary isn\u2019t it\nFirst Harry \u2013 and he was a bad lot all right \u2013 though frightfully good looking.",
    "And then\nTom who never amounted to much though I was fond of him in a way.",
    "Johnnie Pelham \u2013\nthat was a good time while it lasted.",
    "Gerald wasn\u2019t much good either \u2026\u2019\nAt this point the boy brought the coffee thus interrupting what Joan could not but feel\nwas a singularly unsavoury catalogue.",
    "Blanche caught sight of her expression.",
    "\u2018Sorry Joan I\u2019ve shocked you.",
    "Always a bit straitlaced weren\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018Oh I hope I\u2019m always ready to take a broadminded view.\u2019\nJoan achieved a kindly smile.",
    "She added rather awkwardly\n\u2018I only mean I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019\n\u2018For me\u2019 Blanche seemed amused by the idea.",
    "\u2018Nice of you darling but don\u2019t waste\nsympathy.",
    "I\u2019ve had lots of fun.\u2019\nJoan could not resist a swift sideways glance.",
    "Really had Blanche any idea of the\ndeplorable appearance she presented Her carelessly dyed hennaed hair her somewhat\ndirty flamboyant clothes her haggard lined face an old woman \u2013 an old raddled woman\n\u2013 an old disreputable gipsy of a woman\nBlanche her face suddenly growing grave said soberly\n\u2018Yes you\u2019re quite right Joan.",
    "You\u2019ve made a success of your life.",
    "And I \u2013 well I\u2019ve\nmade a mess of mine.",
    "I\u2019ve gone down in the world and you\u2019ve gone \u2013 no you\u2019ve stayed\nwhere you were \u2013 a St Anne\u2019s girl who\u2019s married suitably and always been a credit to the\nold school\u2019\nTrying to steer the conversation towards the only ground that she and Blanche had in\ncommon now Joan said\n\u2018Those were good days weren\u2019t they\u2019\n\u2018Soso.\u2019 Blanche was careless in her praise.",
    "\u2018I got bored sometimes.",
    "It was all so smug\nand consciously healthy.",
    "I wanted to get out and see the world.",
    "Well\u2019 her mouth gave a\nhumorous twist \u2018I\u2019ve seen it.",
    "I\u2019ll say I\u2019ve seen it\u2019\nFor the first time Joan approached the subject of Blanche\u2019s presence in the rest house.",
    "\u2018Are you going back to England Are you leaving on the convoy tomorrow morning\u2019\nHer heart sank just a little as she put the question.",
    "Really she did not want Blanche as\na travelling companion.",
    "A chance meeting was all very well but she had grave doubts of\nbeing able to sustain the pose of friendship all the way across Europe.",
    "Reminiscences of\nthe old days would soon wear thin.",
    "Blanche grinned at her.",
    "\u2018No I\u2019m going the other way.",
    "To Baghdad.",
    "To join my husband.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Your husband\u2019\nJoan really felt quite surprised that Blanche should have anything so respectable as a\nhusband.",
    "\u2018Yes he\u2019s an engineer \u2013 on the railway.",
    "Donovan his name is.\u2019\n\u2018Donovan\u2019 Joan shook her head.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think I came across him at all.\u2019\nBlanche laughed.",
    "\u2018You wouldn\u2019t darling.",
    "Rather out of your class.",
    "He drinks like a fish anyway.",
    "But\nhe\u2019s got a heart like a child.",
    "And it may surprise you but he thinks the world of me.\u2019\n\u2018So he ought\u2019 said Joan loyally and politely.",
    "\u2018Good old Joan.",
    "Always play the game don\u2019t you You must be thankful I\u2019m not\ngoing the other way.",
    "It would break even your Christian spirit to have five days of my\ncompany.",
    "You needn\u2019t trouble to deny it.",
    "I know what I\u2019ve become.",
    "Coarse in mind and\nbody \u2013 that\u2019s what you were thinking.",
    "Well there are worse things.\u2019\nJoan privately doubted very much whether there were.",
    "It seemed to her that Blanche\u2019s\ndecadence was a tragedy of the first water.",
    "Blanche went on\n\u2018Hope you have a good journey but I rather doubt it.",
    "Looks to me as though the rains\nare starting.",
    "If so you may be stuck for days miles from anywhere.\u2019\n\u2018I hope not.",
    "It will upset all my train reservations.\u2019\n\u2018Oh well desert travel is seldom according to schedule.",
    "So long as you get across the\nwadis all right the rest will be easy.",
    "And of course the drivers take plenty of food and\nwater along.",
    "Still it gets a bit boring to be stuck somewhere with nothing to do but think.\u2019\nJoan smiled.",
    "\u2018It might be rather a pleasant change.",
    "You know one never has time as a rule to relax\nat all.",
    "I\u2019ve often wished I could have just one week with really nothing to do.\u2019\n\u2018I should have thought you could have had that whenever you liked\u2019\n\u2018Oh no my dear.",
    "I\u2019m a very busy woman in my small way.",
    "I\u2019m the Secretary of the\nCountry Gardens Association \u2013 And I\u2019m on the committee of our local hospital.",
    "And\nthere\u2019s the Institute \u2013 and the Guides.",
    "And I take quite an active part in politics.",
    "What with\nall that and running the house and then Rodney and I go out a good deal and have people\nin to see us.",
    "It\u2019s so good for a lawyer to have plenty of social background I always think.",
    "And then I\u2019m very fond of my garden and like to do quite a good deal in it myself.",
    "Do you\nknow Blanche that there\u2019s hardly a moment except perhaps a quarter of an hour before\ndinner when I can really sit down and rest And to keep up with one\u2019s reading is quite a\ntask.\u2019\n\u2018You seem to stand up to it all pretty well\u2019 murmured Blanche her eyes on the other\u2019s\nunlined face.",
    "\u2018Well to wear out is better than to rust out And I must admit I\u2019ve always had\n\n\fmarvellous health.",
    "I really am thankful for that.",
    "But all the same it would be wonderful to\nfeel that one had a whole day or even two days with nothing to do but think.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder\u2019 said Blanche \u2018what you\u2019d think about\u2019\nJoan laughed.",
    "It was a pleasant tinkling little sound.",
    "\u2018There are always plenty of things to think about aren\u2019t there\u2019 she said.",
    "Blanche grinned.",
    "\u2018One can always think of one\u2019s sins\u2019\n\u2018Yes indeed.\u2019 Joan assented politely though without amusement.",
    "Blanche eyed her keenly.",
    "\u2018Only that wouldn\u2019t give you occupation long\u2019\nShe frowned and went on abruptly\n\u2018You\u2019d have to go on from them to think of your good deeds.",
    "And all the blessings of\nyour life Hm \u2013 I don\u2019t know.",
    "Might be rather dull.",
    "I wonder\u2019 she paused \u2018if you\u2019d\nnothing to think about but yourself for days and days I wonder what you\u2019d find out about\nyourself \u2013\u2019\nJoan looked sceptical and faintly amused.",
    "\u2018Would one find out anything one didn\u2019t know before\u2019\nBlanche said slowly\n\u2018I think one might \u2026\u2019 She gave a sudden shiver.",
    "\u2018I shouldn\u2019t like to try it.\u2019\n\u2018Of course\u2019 said Joan \u2018some people have an urge towards the contemplative life.",
    "I\u2019ve\nnever been able to understand that myself.",
    "The mystic point of view is very difficult to\nappreciate.",
    "I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t got that kind of religious temperament.",
    "It always seems to\nme to be rather extreme if you know what I mean.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s certainly simpler\u2019 said Blanche \u2018to make use of the shortest prayer that is\nknown.\u2019 And in answer to Joan\u2019s inquiring glance she said abruptly \u2018\u201cGod be merciful to\nme a sinner.\u201d That covers pretty well everything.\u2019\nJoan felt slightly embarrassed.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Yes it certainly does.\u2019\nBlanche burst out laughing.",
    "\u2018The trouble with you Joan is that you\u2019re not a sinner.",
    "That cuts you off from prayer\nNow I\u2019m well equipped.",
    "It seems to me sometimes that I\u2019ve never ceased doing the things\nthat I ought not to have done.\u2019\nJoan was silent because she didn\u2019t know quite what to say.",
    "Blanche resumed again in a lighter tone\n\u2018Oh well that\u2019s the way of the world.",
    "You quit when you ought to stick and you take\non a thing that you\u2019d better leave alone one minute life\u2019s so lovely you can hardly believe\n\n\fit\u2019s true \u2013 and immediately after that you\u2019re going through a hell of misery and suffering\nWhen things are going well you think they\u2019ll last for ever \u2013 and they never do \u2013 and when\nyou\u2019re down under you think you\u2019ll never come up and breathe again.",
    "That\u2019s what life is\nisn\u2019t it\u2019\nIt was so entirely alien to any conception Joan had of life or to life as she had known it\nthat she was unable to make what she felt would be an adequate response.",
    "With a brusque movement Blanche rose to her feet.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re half asleep Joan.",
    "So am I.",
    "And we\u2019ve got an early start.",
    "It\u2019s been nice seeing\nyou.\u2019\nThe two women stood a minute their hands clasped.",
    "Blanche said quickly and\nawkwardly with a sudden rough tenderness in her voice\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry about your Barbara.",
    "She\u2019ll be all right \u2013 I\u2019m sure of it.",
    "Bill Wray is a\ngood sort you know \u2013 and there\u2019s the kid and everything.",
    "It was just that she was very\nyoung and the kind of life out here \u2013 well it goes to a girl\u2019s head sometimes.\u2019\nJoan was conscious of nothing but complete bewilderment.",
    "She said sharply\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u2019\nBlanche merely looked at her admiringly.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s the good old school tie spirit Never admit anything.",
    "You really haven\u2019t\nchanged a bit Joan.",
    "By the way I owe you twentyfive pounds.",
    "Never thought of it until\nthis minute.\u2019\n\u2018Oh don\u2019t bother about that.\u2019\n\u2018No fear.\u2019 Blanche laughed.",
    "\u2018I suppose I meant to pay it back but after all if one ever\ndoes lend money to people one knows quite well one will never see one\u2019s money again.",
    "So\nI haven\u2019t worried much.",
    "You were a good sport Joan \u2013 that money was a godsend.\u2019\n\u2018One of the children had to have an operation didn\u2019t he\u2019\n\u2018So they thought.",
    "But it turned out not to be necessary after all.",
    "So we spent the money\non a bender and got a rolltop desk for Tom as well.",
    "He\u2019d had his eye on it for a long\ntime.\u2019\nMoved by a sudden memory Joan asked\n\u2018Did he ever write his book on Warren Hastings\u2019\nBlanche beamed at her.",
    "\u2018Fancy your remembering that Yes indeed a hundred and twenty thousand words.\u2019\n\u2018Was it published\u2019\n\u2018Of course not After that Tom started on a life of Benjamin Franklin.",
    "That was even\nworse.",
    "Funny taste wasn\u2019t it I mean such dull people.",
    "If I wrote a life it would be of\nsomeone like Cleopatra some sexy piece \u2013 or Casanova say something spicy.",
    "Still we\n\n\fcan\u2019t all have the same ideas.",
    "Tom got a job again in an office \u2013 not so good as the other.",
    "I\u2019m always glad though that he had his fun.",
    "It\u2019s awfully important don\u2019t you think for\npeople to do what they really want to do\u2019\n\u2018It rather depends\u2019 said Joan \u2018on circumstances.",
    "One has to take so many things into\nconsideration.\u2019\n\u2018Haven\u2019t you done what you wanted to do\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019 Joan was taken aback.",
    "\u2018Yes you\u2019 said Blanche.",
    "\u2018You wanted to marry Rodney Scudamore didn\u2019t you And\nyou wanted children And a comfortable home.\u2019 She laughed and added \u2018And to live\nhappily ever afterwards world without end Amen.\u2019\nJoan laughed too relieved at the lighter tone the conversation had taken.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous.",
    "I\u2019ve been very lucky I know.\u2019\nAnd then afraid that that last remark had been tactless when confronted by the ruin\nand bad luck that had been Blanche\u2019s lot in life she added hurriedly\n\u2018I really must go up now.",
    "Good night \u2013 and it\u2019s been marvellous seeing you again.\u2019\nShe squeezed Blanche\u2019s hand warmly would Blanche expect her to kiss her Surely\nnot.",
    "and ran lightly up the stairs to her bedroom.",
    "Poor Blanche thought Joan as she undressed neatly laying and folding her clothes\nputting out a fresh pair of stockings for the morning.",
    "Poor Blanche.",
    "It\u2019s really too tragic.",
    "She slipped into her pyjamas and started to brush her hair.",
    "Poor Blanche.",
    "Looking so awful and so coarse.",
    "She was ready for bed now but paused irresolutely before getting in.",
    "One didn\u2019t of course say one\u2019s prayers every night.",
    "In fact it was quite a long time\nsince Joan had said a prayer of any kind.",
    "And she didn\u2019t even go to church very often.",
    "But one did of course believe.",
    "And she had a sudden odd desire to kneel down now by the side of this rather\nuncomfortable looking bed such nasty cotton sheets thank goodness she had got her own\nsoft pillow with her and well \u2013 say them properly \u2013 like a child.",
    "The thought made her feel rather shy and uncomfortable.",
    "She got quickly into bed and pulled up the covers.",
    "She picked up the book that she had\nlaid on the little table by the bed head The Memoirs of Lady Catherine Dysart \u2013 really\nmost entertainingly written \u2013 a very witty account of midVictorian times.",
    "She read a line or two but found she could not concentrate.",
    "I\u2019m too tired she thought.",
    "She laid down the book and switched off the light.",
    "Again the thought of prayer came to her.",
    "What was it that Blanche had said so\noutrageously \u2013 \u2018that cuts you off from prayer.\u2019 Really what did she mean\n\n\fJoan formed a prayer quickly in her mind \u2013 a prayer of isolated words strung together.",
    "God \u2013 thank thee \u2013 poor Blanche \u2013 thank thee that I am not like that \u2013 great mercies \u2013\nall my blessings \u2013 and especially not like poor Blanche \u2013 poor Blanche \u2013 really dreadful.",
    "Her own fault of course \u2013 dreadful \u2013 quite a shock \u2013 thank God \u2013 I am different \u2013 poor\nBlanche \u2026\nJoan fell asleep.",
    "Chapter Two\nIt was raining when Joan Scudamore left the rest house the following morning a fine\ngentle rain that seemed somehow incongruous in this part of the world.",
    "She found that she was the only passenger going west \u2013 a sufficiently uncommon\noccurrence it appeared although there was not much traffic this time of year.",
    "There had\nbeen a large convoy on the preceding Friday.",
    "A battered looking touring car was waiting with a European driver and a native relief\ndriver.",
    "The manager of the rest house was on the steps in the grey dawn of the morning to\nhand Joan in yell at the Arabs until they adjusted the baggage to his satisfaction and to\nwish Mademoiselle as he called all his lady guests a safe and comfortable journey.",
    "He\nbowed magnificently and handed her a small cardboard container in which was her lunch.",
    "The driver yelled out cheerily\n\u2018Bye bye Satan see you tomorrow night or next week \u2013 and it looks more like next\nweek.\u2019\nThe car started off.",
    "It wound through the streets of the oriental city with its grotesque\nand unexpected blocks of occidental architecture.",
    "The horn blared donkeys swerved\naside children ran.",
    "They drove out through the western gate and on to a broad unequally\npaved road that looked important enough to run to the world\u2019s end.",
    "Actually it petered out abruptly after two kilometres and an irregular track took its\nplace.",
    "In good weather it was Joan knew about seven hours\u2019 run to Tell Abu Hamid which\nwas the present terminus of the Turkish railway.",
    "The train from Stamboul arrived there\nthis morning and would go back again at eightthirty this evening.",
    "There was a small rest\nhouse at Tell Abu Hamid for the convenience of travellers where they were served with\nwhat meals they might need.",
    "They should meet the convoy coming east about halfway\nalong the track.",
    "The going was now very uneven.",
    "The car leapt and jumped and Joan was thrown up\nand down in her seat.",
    "The driver called back that he hoped she was all right.",
    "It was a bumpy bit of track but\nhe wanted to hurry as much as possible in case he had difficulty crossing the two wadis\nthey had to negotiate.",
    "From time to time he looked anxiously up at the sky.",
    "The rain began to fall faster and the car began to do a series of skids zigzagging to and\nfro and making Joan feel slightly sick.",
    "They reached the first wadi about eleven.",
    "There was water in it but they got across\nand after a slight peril of sticking on the hill up the other side drew out of it successfully.",
    "About two kilometres farther on they ran into soft ground and stuck there.",
    "Joan slipped on her mackintosh coat and got out opening her box of lunch and eating\nas she walked up and down and watched the two men working digging with spades\nflinging jacks at each other putting boards they had brought with them under the wheels.",
    "They swore and toiled and the wheels spun angrily in the air.",
    "It seemed to Joan an\nimpossible task but the driver assured her that it wasn\u2019t a bad place at all.",
    "Finally with\nunnerving suddenness the wheels bit and roared and the car quivered forward on to drier\nground.",
    "A little farther on they encountered two cars coming in the opposite direction.",
    "All three\nstopped and the drivers held a consultation giving each other recommendations and\nadvice.",
    "In the other cars were a woman and a baby a young French officer an elderly\nArmenian and two commercial looking Englishmen.",
    "Presently they went on.",
    "They stuck twice more and again the long laborious business\nof jacking up and digging out had to be undertaken.",
    "The second wadi was more difficult of\nnegotiation than the first one.",
    "It was dusk when they came to it and the water was rushing\nthrough it.",
    "Joan asked anxiously\n\u2018Will the train wait\u2019\n\u2018They usually give an hour\u2019s grace.",
    "They can make up that on the run but they won\u2019t\ndelay beyond ninethirty.",
    "However the track gets better from now on.",
    "Different kind of\nground \u2013 more open desert.\u2019\nThey had a bad time clearing the wadi \u2013 the farther bank was sheer slippery mud.",
    "It\nwas dark when the car at last reached dry ground.",
    "From then on the going was better but\nwhen they got to Tell Abu Hamid it was a quarter past ten and the train to Stamboul had\ngone.",
    "Joan was so completely done up that she hardly noticed her surroundings.",
    "She stumbled into the rest house diningroom with its trestle tables refused food but\nasked for tea and then went straight to the dimly lit bleak room with its three iron beds\nand taking out bare necessaries she tumbled into bed and slept like a log.",
    "She awoke the next morning her usual cool competent self.",
    "She sat up in bed and\nlooked at her watch.",
    "It was half past nine.",
    "She got up dressed and came out into the\ndiningroom.",
    "An Indian with an artistic turban wrapped round his head appeared and she\nordered breakfast.",
    "Then she strolled to the door and looked out.",
    "With a slight humorous grimace she acknowledged to herself that she had indeed\narrived at the middle of nowhere.",
    "This time she reflected it looked like taking about double the time.",
    "On her journey out she had flown from Cairo to Baghdad.",
    "This route was new to her.",
    "It\nwas actually seven days from Baghdad to London \u2013 three days in the train from London to\nStamboul two days on to Aleppo another night to the end of the railway at Tell Abu\nHamid then a day\u2019s motoring a night in a rest house and another motor drive to Kirkuk\n\n\fand on by train to Baghdad.",
    "There was no sign of rain this morning.",
    "The sky was blue and cloudless and all\naround was even coloured golden brown sandy dust.",
    "From the rest house itself a tangle of\nbarbed wire enclosed a refuse dump of tins and a space where some skinny chickens ran\nabout squawking loudly.",
    "Clouds of flies had settled on such tins as had recently contained\nnourishment.",
    "Something that looked like a bundle of dirty rags suddenly got up and\nproved to be an Arab boy.",
    "A little distance away across another tangle of barbed wire was a squat building that\nwas evidently the station with something that Joan took to be either an artesian well or a\nbig water tank beside it.",
    "On the far horizon to the north was the faint outline of a range of\nhills.",
    "Apart from that nothing.",
    "No landmarks no buildings no vegetation no human kind.",
    "A station a railway track some hens what seemed to be a disproportionate amount of\nbarbed wire \u2013 and that was all.",
    "Really Joan thought it was very amusing.",
    "Such an odd place to be held up.",
    "The Indian servant came out and said that the Memsahib\u2019s breakfast was ready.",
    "Joan turned and went in.",
    "The characteristic atmosphere of a rest house gloom mutton\nfat paraffin and Flit greeted her with a sense of rather distasteful familiarity.",
    "There was coffee and milk tinned milk a whole dish of fried eggs some hard little\nrounds of toast a dish of jam and some rather doubtful looking stewed prunes.",
    "Joan ate with a good appetite.",
    "And presently the Indian reappeared and asked what\ntime the Memsahib would like lunch.",
    "Joan said not for a long time \u2013 and it was agreed that half past one would be a\nsatisfactory hour.",
    "The trains as she knew went three days a week on Monday Wednesday and Friday.",
    "It\nwas Tuesday morning so she would not be able to leave until tomorrow night.",
    "She spoke\nto the man asking if that was correct.",
    "\u2018That right Memsahib.",
    "Miss train last night.",
    "Very unfortunate.",
    "Track very bad rain\nvery heavy in night.",
    "That means no cars can go to and fro from here to Mosul for some\ndays.\u2019\n\u2018But the trains will be all right\u2019\nJoan was not interested in the Mosul track.",
    "\u2018Oh yes train come all right tomorrow morning.",
    "Go back tomorrow night.\u2019\nJoan nodded.",
    "She asked about the car which had brought her.",
    "\u2018Go off this morning early.",
    "Driver hope get through.",
    "But I think not.",
    "I think him stick\none two days on way there.\u2019\nAgain without much interest Joan thought it highly probable.",
    "The man went on giving information.",
    "\u2018That station Memsahib over there.\u2019\nJoan said that she had thought somehow that it might be the station.",
    "\u2018Turkish station.",
    "Station in Turkey.",
    "Railway Turkish.",
    "Other side of wire see.",
    "That wire\nfrontier.\u2019\nJoan looked respectfully at the frontier and thought what very odd things frontiers\nwere.",
    "The Indian said happily\n\u2018Lunch onethirty exactly\u2019 and went back into the rest house.",
    "A minute or two later\nshe heard him screaming in a high angry voice from somewhere at the back of it.",
    "Two\nother voices chimed in.",
    "A spate of high excited Arabic filled the air.",
    "Joan wondered why it was always Indians who seemed to be in charge of rest houses\nlike this one.",
    "Perhaps they had had experience of European ways.",
    "Oh well it didn\u2019t much\nmatter.",
    "What should she do with herself this morning She might go on with the amusing\nMemoirs of Lady Catherine Dysart.",
    "Or she might write some letters.",
    "She could post them\nwhen the train got to Aleppo.",
    "She had a writing pad and some envelopes with her.",
    "She\nhesitated on the threshold of the rest house.",
    "It was so dark inside and it smelt so.",
    "Perhaps\nshe would go for a walk.",
    "She fetched her thick double felt hat \u2013 not that the sun was really dangerous at this\ntime of year still it was better to be careful.",
    "She put on her dark glasses and slipped the\nwriting pad and her fountain pen into her bag.",
    "Then she set out past the refuse dump and the tins in the opposite direction to the\nrailway station since there might possibly be international complications if she tried to\ncross the frontier.",
    "She thought to herself How curious it is walking like this \u2026 there\u2019s nowhere to walk\nto.",
    "It was a novel and rather interesting idea.",
    "Walking on the downs on moorland on a\nbeach down a road \u2013 there was always some objective in view.",
    "Over that hill to that\nclump of trees to that patch of heather down this lane to the farm along the high road to\nthe next town by the side of the waves to the next cove.",
    "But here it was from \u2013 not to.",
    "Away from the rest house \u2013 that was all.",
    "Right hand left\nhand straight ahead \u2013 just bare duncoloured horizon.",
    "She strolled along not too briskly.",
    "The air was pleasant.",
    "It was hot but not too hot.",
    "A\nthermometer she thought would have registered seventy.",
    "And there was a faint a very\nfaint breeze.",
    "She walked for about ten minutes before turning her head.",
    "The rest house and its sordid accompaniments had receded in a very accommodating\nmanner.",
    "From here it looked quite pleasant.",
    "Beyond it the station looked like a little cairn\nof stones.",
    "Joan smiled and strolled on.",
    "Really the air was delicious There was a purity in it a\nfreshness.",
    "No staleness here no taint of humanity or civilization.",
    "Sun and sky and sandy\nearth that was all.",
    "Something a little intoxicating in its quality.",
    "Joan took deep breaths into\nher lungs.",
    "She was enjoying herself.",
    "Really this was quite an adventure A most welcome\nbreak in the monotony of existence.",
    "She was quite glad she had missed the train.",
    "Twentyfour hours of absolute quiet and peace would be good for her.",
    "It was not as though there\nwere any absolute urgency in her return.",
    "She could wire to Rodney from Stamboul\nexplaining the delay.",
    "Dear old Rodney She wondered what he was doing now.",
    "Not really that there was\nanything to wonder about because she knew.",
    "He would be sitting in his office at\nAlderman Scudamore and Witney\u2019s \u2013 quite a nice room on the first floor looking out over\nthe Market Square.",
    "He had moved into it when old Mr Witney died.",
    "He liked that room \u2013\nShe remembered how she had come in one day to see him and had found him standing by\nthe window staring out at the market it was market day and at a herd of cattle that was\nbeing driven in.",
    "\u2018Nice lot of shorthorns \u2013 those\u2019 he had said.",
    "Or perhaps it wasn\u2019t\nshorthorns \u2013 Joan wasn\u2019t very good at farming terms \u2013 but something like that anyway.",
    "And she had said \u2018About the new boiler for the central heating I think Galbraith\u2019s\nestimate is far too high.",
    "Shall I see what Chamberlain would charge\u2019\nShe remembered the slow way Rodney had turned taking off his glasses and rubbing\nhis eyes and looking at her in an absent faraway manner as though he didn\u2019t really see her\nand the way he had said \u2018boiler\u2019 as though it was some difficult and remote subject he\nhad never heard of and then saying \u2013 really rather stupidly \u2018I believe Hoddesdon\u2019s selling\nthat young bull of his.",
    "Wants the money I suppose.\u2019\nShe thought it was very nice of Rodney to be so interested in old Hoddesdon at Lower\nMead farm.",
    "Poor old man everyone knew he was going down the hill.",
    "But she did wish\nRodney would be a little quicker at listening to what was said to him.",
    "Because after all\npeople expected a lawyer to be sharp and alert and if Rodney was to look at clients in that\nvague way it might create quite a bad impression.",
    "So she had said with quick affectionate impatience\n\u2018Don\u2019t woolgather Rodney.",
    "It\u2019s the boiler I\u2019m talking about for the central heating.\u2019\nAnd Rodney had said certainly have a second estimate but that costs were bound to be\nhigher and they must just make up their minds to it.",
    "And then he had glanced at the papers\npiled up on his desk and she had said that she mustn\u2019t keep him \u2013 it looked as though he\nhad a lot of work to do.",
    "Rodney smiled and said that as a matter of fact he had got a lot of work piled up \u2013 and\nhe\u2019d been wasting time already watching the market.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s why I like this room\u2019 he\nsaid.",
    "\u2018I look forward to Fridays.",
    "Listen to \u2019em now.\u2019\nAnd he had held up his hand and she had listened and heard a good deal of mooing\nand lowing \u2013 really a very confused and rather ugly noise of cattle and sheep \u2013 but\nRodney funnily enough seemed to like it.",
    "He stood there his head a little on one side\nsmiling \u2026\nOh well it would not be market day today.",
    "Rodney would be at his desk with no\ndistractions.",
    "And her fears about clients thinking Rodney vague had been quite unfounded.",
    "He was by far the most popular member of the firm.",
    "Everyone liked him which was half\nthe battle in a country solicitor\u2019s practice.",
    "And but for me thought Joan proudly he\u2019d have turned the whole thing down\nHer thoughts went to that day when Rodney had told her about his uncle\u2019s offer.",
    "It was an oldfashioned flourishing family business and it had always been understood\nthat Rodney should go into it after he had passed his law exams.",
    "But Uncle Harry\u2019s offer\nof a partnership and on such excellent terms was an unexpectedly happy occurrence.",
    "Joan had expressed her own delight and surprise and had congratulated Rodney\nwarmly before she noticed that Rodney didn\u2019t seem to be sharing in her sentiments.",
    "He\nhad actually uttered the incredible words \u2018If I accept \u2013\u2019\nShe had exclaimed dismayed \u2018But Rodney\u2019\nClearly she remembered the white set face he had turned to her.",
    "She hadn\u2019t realized\nbefore what a nervous person Rodney was.",
    "His hands picking up blades of turf were\ntrembling.",
    "There was a curious pleading look in his dark eyes.",
    "He said\n\u2018I hate office life.",
    "I hate it.\u2019\nJoan was quick to sympathize.",
    "\u2018Oh I know darling.",
    "It\u2019s been awfully stuffy and hard work and just sheer grind \u2013 not\neven interesting.",
    "But a partnership is different \u2013 I mean you\u2019ll have an interest in the\nwhole thing.\u2019\n\u2018In contracts leases messuages covenants whereas insomuch as heretofore \u2013\u2019\nSome absurd legal rigmarole he had trotted out his mouth laughing his eyes sad and\npleading \u2013 pleading so hard with her.",
    "And she loved Rodney so much\n\u2018But it\u2019s always been understood that you\u2019d go into the firm.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I know I know.",
    "But how was I to guess I\u2019d hate it so\u2019\n\u2018But \u2013 I mean \u2013 what else \u2013 what do you want to do\u2019\nAnd he had said very quickly and eagerly the words pouring out in a rush\n\u2018I want to farm.",
    "There\u2019s Little Mead coming into the market.",
    "It\u2019s in a bad state \u2013\nHorley\u2019s neglected it \u2013 but that\u2019s why one could get it cheap \u2013 and it\u2019s good land mark\nyou \u2026\u2019\nAnd he had hurried on outlining plans talking in such technical terms that she had felt\nquite bewildered for she herself knew nothing of wheat or barley or the rotation of crops\nor of pedigreed stocks or dairy herds.",
    "She could only say in a dismayed voice\n\u2018Little Mead \u2013 but that\u2019s right out under Asheldown \u2013 miles from anywhere.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s good land Joan \u2013 and a good position \u2026\u2019\nHe was off again.",
    "She\u2019d had no idea that Rodney could be so enthusiastic could talk\nso much and with such eagerness.",
    "She said doubtfully \u2018But darling would you ever make a living out of it\u2019\n\u2018A living Oh yes \u2013 a bare living anyway.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what I mean.",
    "People always say there\u2019s no money in farming.\u2019\n\u2018Oh there isn\u2019t.",
    "Not unless you\u2019re damned lucky \u2013 or unless you\u2019ve got a lot of\ncapital.\u2019\n\u2018Well you see \u2013 I mean it isn\u2019t practical.\u2019\n\u2018Oh but it is Joan.",
    "I\u2019ve got a little money of my own remember and with the farm\npaying its way and making a bit over we\u2019d be all right.",
    "And think of the wonderful life\nwe\u2019d have It\u2019s grand living on a farm\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t believe you know anything about it.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes I do.",
    "Didn\u2019t you know my mother\u2019s father was a big farmer in Devonshire\nWe spent our holidays there as children.",
    "I\u2019ve never enjoyed myself so much.\u2019\nIt\u2019s true what they say she had thought men are just like children \u2026\nShe said gently \u2018I daresay \u2013 but life isn\u2019t holidays.",
    "We\u2019ve got the future to think of\nRodney.",
    "There\u2019s Tony.\u2019\nFor Tony had been a baby of eleven months then.",
    "She added \u2018And there may be \u2013 others.\u2019\nHe looked a quick question at her and she smiled and nodded.",
    "\u2018But don\u2019t you see Joan that makes it all the better It\u2019s a good place for children a\nfarm.",
    "It\u2019s a healthy place.",
    "They have fresh eggs and milk and run wild and learn how to\nlook after animals.\u2019\n\u2018Oh but Rodney there are lots of other things to consider.",
    "There\u2019s their schooling.",
    "They must go to good schools.",
    "And that\u2019s expensive.",
    "And boots and clothes and teeth and\ndoctors.",
    "And making nice friends for them.",
    "You can\u2019t just do what you want to do.",
    "You\u2019ve\ngot to consider children if you bring them into the world.",
    "After all you\u2019ve got a duty to\nthem.\u2019\nRodney said obstinately but there was a question in his voice this time \u2018They\u2019d be\nhappy \u2026\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not practical Rodney really it isn\u2019t.",
    "Why if you go into the firm you may be\nmaking as much as two thousand pounds a year some day.\u2019\n\u2018Easily I should think.",
    "Uncle Harry makes more than that.\u2019\n\u2018There You see You can\u2019t turn a thing like that down.",
    "It would be madness\u2019\nShe had spoken very decidedly very positively.",
    "She had got she saw to be firm about\nthis.",
    "She must be wise for the two of them.",
    "If Rodney was blind to what was best for him\nshe must assume the responsibility.",
    "It was so dear and silly and ridiculous this farming\nidea.",
    "He was like a little boy.",
    "She felt strong and confident and maternal.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t understand and sympathize Rodney\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I do.",
    "But it\u2019s just\n\n\fone of those things that isn\u2019t real.\u2019\nHe had interrupted to say that farming was real enough.",
    "\u2018Yes but it\u2019s just not in the picture.",
    "Our picture.",
    "Here you\u2019ve got a wonderful family\nbusiness with a firstclass opening in it for you \u2013 and a really quite amazingly generous\nproposition from your uncle \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Oh I know.",
    "It\u2019s far better than I ever expected.\u2019\n\u2018And you can\u2019t \u2013 you simply can\u2019t turn it down You\u2019d regret it all your life if you did.",
    "You\u2019d feel horribly guilty.\u2019\nHe muttered \u2018That bloody office\u2019\n\u2018Oh Rodney you don\u2019t really hate it as much as you think you do.\u2019\n\u2018Yes I do.",
    "I\u2019ve been in it five years remember.",
    "I ought to know what I feel.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll get used to it.",
    "And it will be different now.",
    "Quite different.",
    "Being a partner I\nmean.",
    "And you\u2019ll end by getting quite interested in the work \u2013 and in the people you come\nacross.",
    "You\u2019ll see Rodney \u2013 you\u2019ll end by being perfectly happy.\u2019\nHe had looked at her then \u2013 a long sad look.",
    "There had been love in it and despair and\nsomething else something that had been perhaps a last faint flicker of hope \u2026\n\u2018How do you know\u2019 he had asked \u2018that I shall be happy\u2019\nAnd she had answered briskly and gaily \u2018I\u2019m quite sure you will.",
    "You\u2019ll see.\u2019\nAnd she had nodded brightly and with authority.",
    "He had sighed and said abruptly \u2018All right then.",
    "Have it your own way.\u2019\nYes Joan thought that was really a very narrow shave.",
    "How lucky for Rodney that she\nhad held firm and not allowed him to throw away his career for a mere passing craze\nMen she thought would make sad messes of their lives if it weren\u2019t for women.",
    "Women\nhad stability a sense of reality \u2026\nYes it was lucky for Rodney he\u2019d had her.",
    "She glanced down at her wrist watch.",
    "Half past ten.",
    "No point in walking too far \u2013\nespecially she smiled as there was nowhere to walk to.",
    "She looked over her shoulder.",
    "Extraordinary the rest house was nearly out of sight.",
    "It\nhad settled down into the landscape so that you hardly saw it.",
    "She thought I must be\ncareful not to walk too far.",
    "I might get lost.",
    "A ridiculous idea \u2013 no \u2013 perhaps not so ridiculous after all.",
    "Those hills in the distance\nyou could hardly see them now \u2013 they were indistinguishable from cloud.",
    "The station\ndidn\u2019t exist.",
    "Joan looked round her with appreciation.",
    "Nothing.",
    "No one.",
    "She dropped gracefully to the ground.",
    "Opening her bag she took out her writing pad\nand her fountain pen.",
    "She\u2019d write a few letters.",
    "It would be amusing to pass on her\nsensations.",
    "Who should she write to Lionel West Janet Annesmore Dorothea On the whole\nperhaps Janet.",
    "She unscrewed the cap of her fountain pen.",
    "In her easy flowing handwriting she began\nto write\nDearest Janet You\u2019ll never guess where I\u2019m writing this letter In the middle of the\ndesert.",
    "I\u2019m marooned here between trains \u2013 they only go three times a week.",
    "There\u2019s a rest house with an Indian in charge of it and a lot of hens and some\npeculiar looking Arabs and me.",
    "There\u2019s no one to talk to and nothing to do.",
    "I can\u2019t\ntell you how I am enjoying it.",
    "The desert air is wonderful \u2013 so incredibly fresh.",
    "And the stillness you\u2019d have\nto feel it to understand.",
    "It\u2019s as though for the first time for years I could hear\nmyself think One leads such a dreadfully busy life always rushing from one thing\nto the other.",
    "It can\u2019t be helped I suppose but one ought really to make time for\nintervals of thought and recuperation.",
    "I\u2019ve only been here half a day but I feel miles better already.",
    "No people.",
    "I never\nrealized how much I wanted to get away from people.",
    "It\u2019s soothing to the nerves to\nknow that all round you for hundreds of miles there\u2019s nothing but sand and sun \u2026\nJoan\u2019s pen flowed on evenly over the paper.",
    "Chapter Three\nJoan stopped writing and glanced at her watch.",
    "A quarter past twelve.",
    "She had written three letters and her pen had now run out of ink.",
    "She noted too that\nshe had nearly finished her writing pad.",
    "Rather annoying that.",
    "There were several more\npeople she could have written to.",
    "Although she mused there was a certain sameness in writing after a while \u2026 The sun\nand the sand and how lovely it was to have time to rest and think All quite true \u2013 but one\ngot tired of trying to phrase the same facts slightly differently each time \u2026\nShe yawned.",
    "The sun had really made her feel quite sleepy.",
    "After lunch she would lie\non her bed and have a sleep.",
    "She got up and strolled slowly back towards the rest house.",
    "She wondered what Blanche was doing now.",
    "She must have reached Baghdad \u2013 she\nhad joined her husband.",
    "The husband sounded rather a dreadful kind of man.",
    "Poor\nBlanche \u2013 dreadful to come down in the world like that.",
    "If it hadn\u2019t been for that very\ngoodlooking young vet Harry Marston \u2013 if Blanche had met some nice man like Rodney.",
    "Blanche herself had said how charming Rodney was.",
    "Yes and Blanche had said something else.",
    "What was it Something about Rodney\u2019s\nhaving a roving eye.",
    "Such a common expression \u2013 and quite untrue Quite untrue Rodney\nhad never \u2013 never once \u2013\nThe same thought as before but not so snakelike in its rapidity passed across the\nsurface of Joan\u2019s mind.",
    "The Randolph girl \u2026\nReally thought Joan indignantly walking suddenly just a little faster as though to\noutpace some unwelcome thought I can\u2019t imagine why I keep thinking of the Randolph\ngirl.",
    "It\u2019s not as though Rodney \u2026\nI mean there\u2019s nothing in it \u2026\nNothing at all \u2026\nIt was simply that Myrna Randolph was that kind of a girl.",
    "A big dark lusciouslooking girl.",
    "A girl who if she took a fancy to a man didn\u2019t seem to have any reticence\nabout advertising the fact.",
    "To speak plainly she\u2019d made a dead set at Rodney.",
    "Kept saying how wonderful he\nwas.",
    "Always wanted him for a partner at tennis.",
    "Had even got a habit of sitting at parties\ndevouring him with her eyes.",
    "Naturally Rodney had been a little flattered.",
    "Any man would have been.",
    "In fact it\n\n\fwould have been quite ridiculous if Rodney hadn\u2019t been flattered and pleased by the\nattentions of a girl years younger than he was and one of the bestlooking girls in the\ntown.",
    "Joan thought to herself if I hadn\u2019t been clever and tactful about the whole thing \u2026\nShe reviewed her conduct with a gentle glow of selfapprobation.",
    "She had handled the\nsituation very well \u2013 very well indeed.",
    "The light touch.",
    "\u2018Your girl friend\u2019s waiting for you Rodney.",
    "Don\u2019t keep her waiting \u2026 Myrna\nRandolph of course \u2026 Oh yes she is darling \u2026 Really she makes herself quite ridiculous\nsometimes.\u2019\nRodney had grumbled.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t want to play tennis with the girl.",
    "Put her in that other set.\u2019\n\u2018Now don\u2019t be ungracious Rodney.",
    "You must play with her.\u2019\nThat was the right way to handle things \u2013 lightly \u2013 playfully.",
    "Showing quite well that\nshe knew that there couldn\u2019t be anything serious in it \u2026\nIt must have been rather nice for Rodney \u2013 for all that he growled and pretended to be\nannoyed.",
    "Myrna Randolph was the kind of girl that practically every man found attractive.",
    "She was capricious and treated her admirers with deep contempt saying rude things to\nthem and then beckoning them back to her with a sideways glance of the eyes.",
    "Really thought Joan with a heat that was unusual in her a most detestable girl.",
    "Doing\neverything she could to break up my married life.",
    "No she didn\u2019t blame Rodney.",
    "She blamed the girl.",
    "Men were so easily flattered.",
    "And\nRodney had been married then about \u2013 what \u2013 ten years Eleven Ten years was what\nwriters called a dangerous period in married life.",
    "A time when one or the other party had a\ntendency to run off the rails.",
    "A time to get through warily until you settled down beyond it\ninto comfortable set ways.",
    "As she and Rodney had \u2026\nNo she didn\u2019t blame Rodney \u2013 not even for that kiss she had surprised.",
    "Under the mistletoe indeed\nThat was what the girl had had the impudence to say when she came into the study.",
    "\u2018We\u2019re christening the mistletoe Mrs Scudamore.",
    "Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u2019\nWell Joan thought I kept my head and didn\u2019t show anything.",
    "\u2018Now hands off my husband Myrna Go and find some young man of your own.\u2019\nAnd she had laughingly chivvied Myrna out of the room.",
    "Taking it all as a joke.",
    "And then Rodney had said \u2018Sorry Joan.",
    "But she\u2019s an attractive wench \u2013 and it\u2019s\nChristmas time.\u2019\nHe had stood there smiling at her apologizing but not looking really sheepish or\nupset.",
    "It showed that the thing hadn\u2019t really gone far.",
    "And it shouldn\u2019t go any farther She had made up her mind to that.",
    "She had taken\nevery care to keep Rodney out of Myrna Randolph\u2019s way.",
    "And the following Easter Myrna\nhad got engaged to the Arlington boy.",
    "So really the whole incident amounted to exactly nothing at all.",
    "Perhaps there had been\njust a little fun in it for Rodney.",
    "Poor old Rodney \u2013 he really deserved a little fun.",
    "He\nworked so hard.",
    "Ten years \u2013 yes it was a dangerous time.",
    "Even she herself she remembered had felt a\ncertain restlessness \u2026\nThat rather wildlooking young man that artist \u2013 what was his name now Really she\ncouldn\u2019t remember.",
    "Hadn\u2019t she been a little taken with him herself\nShe admitted to herself with a smile that she really had been \u2013 yes \u2013 just a little silly\nabout him.",
    "He had been so earnest \u2013 had stared at her with such disarming intensity.",
    "Then\nhe had asked if she would sit for him.",
    "An excuse of course.",
    "He had done one or two charcoal sketches and then torn them\nup.",
    "He couldn\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 her on canvas he had said.",
    "Joan remembered her own subtly flattered pleased feelings.",
    "Poor boy she had\nthought I\u2019m afraid he really is getting rather fond of me \u2026\nYes that had been a pleasant month \u2026\nThough the end of it had been rather disconcerting.",
    "Not at all according to plan.",
    "In\nfact it just showed that Michael Callaway Callaway that was his name of course was a\nthoroughly unsatisfactory sort of person.",
    "They had gone for a walk together she remembered in Haling Woods along the path\nwhere the Medaway comes twisting down from the summit of Asheldown.",
    "He had asked\nher to come in a rather gruff shy voice.",
    "She had envisaged their probable conversation.",
    "He would tell her perhaps that he\nloved her and she would be very sweet and gentle and understanding and a little \u2013 just a\nlittle \u2013 regretful.",
    "She thought of several charming things she might say things that\nMichael might like to remember afterwards.",
    "But it hadn\u2019t turned out like that.",
    "It hadn\u2019t turned out like that at all\nInstead Michael Callaway had without warning seized her and kissed her with a\nviolence and a brutality that had momentarily deprived her of breath and letting go of her\nhad observed in a loud and selfcongratulatory voice\n\u2018My God I wanted that\u2019 and had proceeded to fill a pipe with complete unconcern\nand apparently deaf to her angry reproaches.",
    "He had merely said stretching his arms and yawning \u2018I feel a lot better now.\u2019\nIt was exactly thought Joan remembering the scene what a man might say after\ndowning a glass of beer on a thirsty day.",
    "They had walked home in silence after that \u2013 in silence on Joan\u2019s part that is.",
    "Michael\n\n\fCallaway seemed from the extraordinary noises he made to be attempting to sing.",
    "It was\non the outskirts of the wood just before they emerged on to the Crayminster Market\nWopling high road that he had paused and surveyed her dispassionately and then\nremarked in a contemplative tone\n\u2018You know you\u2019re the sort of woman who ought to be raped.",
    "It might do you good.\u2019\nAnd whilst she had stood speechless with anger and astonishment he had added\ncheerfully\n\u2018I\u2019d rather like to rape you myself \u2013 and see if you looked the least bit different\nafterwards.\u2019\nThen he had stepped out on to the high road and giving up trying to sing had whistled\ncheerfully.",
    "Naturally she had never spoken to him again and he had left Crayminster a few days\nlater.",
    "A strange puzzling and rather disturbing incident.",
    "Not an incident that Joan had cared\nto remember.",
    "In fact she rather wondered that she had remembered it now \u2026\nHorrid the whole thing had been quite horrid.",
    "She would put it out of her mind at once.",
    "After all one didn\u2019t want to remember\nunpleasant things when one was having a sun and sand rest cure.",
    "There was so much to\nthink of that was pleasant and stimulating.",
    "Perhaps lunch would be ready.",
    "She glanced at her watch but saw that it was only a\nquarter to one.",
    "When she got back to the rest house she went to her room and hunted in her suitcase\nto see if she had any more writing paper with her.",
    "No she hadn\u2019t.",
    "Oh well it didn\u2019t matter\nreally.",
    "She was tired of writing letters.",
    "There wasn\u2019t much to say.",
    "You couldn\u2019t go on\nwriting the same thing.",
    "What books had she got Lady Catherine of course.",
    "And a\ndetective story that William had given her last thing.",
    "Kind of him but she didn\u2019t really\ncare for detective stories.",
    "And The Power House by Buchan.",
    "Surely that was a very old\nbook.",
    "She had read it years ago.",
    "Oh well she would be able to buy some more books at the station at Aleppo.",
    "Lunch consisted of an omelette rather tough and overcooked curried eggs and a dish\nof salmon tinned and baked beans and tinned peaches.",
    "It was rather a heavy meal.",
    "After it Joan went and lay down on her bed.",
    "She slept for\nthree quarters of an hour then woke up and read Lady Catherine Dysart until tea time.",
    "She had tea tinned milk and biscuits and went for a stroll and came back and finished\nLady Catherine Dysart.",
    "Then she had dinner omelette curried salmon and rice a dish of\neggs and baked beans and tinned apricots.",
    "After that she started the detective story and\nfinished it by the time she was ready for bed.",
    "The Indian said cheerfully\n\u2018Good night Memsahib.",
    "Train come in seventhirty tomorrow morning but not go out\n\n\ftill evening half past eight.\u2019\nJoan nodded.",
    "There would be another day to put in.",
    "She\u2019d got The Power House still.",
    "A pity it was\nso short.",
    "Then an idea struck her.",
    "\u2018There will be travellers coming in on the train Oh but they go straight off to Mosul\nI suppose\u2019\nThe man shook his head.",
    "\u2018Not tomorrow I think.",
    "No cars arrive today.",
    "I think track to Mosul very bad.",
    "Everything stick for many days.\u2019\nJoan brightened.",
    "There would be travellers off the train in the rest house tomorrow.",
    "That would be rather nice \u2013 there was sure to be someone to whom it would be possible to\ntalk.",
    "She went to bed feeling more cheerful than she had ten minutes ago.",
    "She thought\nThere\u2019s something about the atmosphere of this place \u2013 I think it\u2019s that dreadful smell of\nrancid fat It quite depresses one.",
    "She awoke the next morning at eight o\u2019clock and got up and dressed.",
    "She came out\ninto the diningroom.",
    "One place only was laid at the table.",
    "She called and the Indian came\nin.",
    "He was looking excited.",
    "\u2018Train not come Memsahib.\u2019\n\u2018Not come You mean it\u2019s late\u2019\n\u2018Not come at all.",
    "Very heavy rain down line \u2013 other side Nissibin.",
    "Line all wash away\n\u2013 no train get through for three four five six days perhaps.\u2019\nJoan looked at him in dismay.",
    "\u2018But then \u2013 what do I do\u2019\n\u2018You stay here Memsahib.",
    "Plenty food plenty beer plenty tea.",
    "Very nice.",
    "You wait till\ntrain come.\u2019\nOh dear thought Joan these Orientals.",
    "Time means nothing to them.",
    "She said \u2018Couldn\u2019t I get a car\u2019\nHe seemed amused.",
    "\u2018Motor car Where would you get motor car Track to Mosul very bad everything\nstuck other side of wadi.\u2019\n\u2018Can\u2019t you telephone down the line\u2019\n\u2018Telephone where Turkish line.",
    "Turks very difficult people \u2013 not do anything.",
    "They\njust run train.\u2019\nJoan thought rallying with what she hoped was amusement This really is being cut\noff from civilization No telephones or telegraphs no cars.",
    "The Indian said comfortingly\n\u2018Very nice weather plenty food all very comfortable.\u2019\nWell Joan thought it\u2019s certainly nice weather.",
    "That\u2019s lucky.",
    "Awful if I had to sit inside\nthis place all day.",
    "As though reading her thoughts the man said\n\u2018Weather good here very seldom rain.",
    "Rain nearer Mosul rain down the line.\u2019\nJoan sat down at the laid place at the table and waited for her breakfast to be brought.",
    "She had got over her momentary dismay.",
    "No good making a fuss \u2013 she had much too\nmuch sense for that.",
    "These things couldn\u2019t be helped.",
    "But it was rather an annoying waste\nof time.",
    "She thought with a half smile It looks as though what I said to Blanche was a wish\nthat has come true.",
    "I said I should be glad of an interval to rest my nerves.",
    "Well I\u2019ve got\nit Nothing whatever to do here.",
    "Not even anything to read.",
    "Really it ought to do me a lot\nof good.",
    "Rest cure in the desert.",
    "The thought of Blanche brought some slightly unpleasant association \u2013 something that\nquite definitely she didn\u2019t want to remember.",
    "In fact why think of Blanche at all\nShe went out after breakfast.",
    "As before she walked a reasonable distance from the rest\nhouse and then sat down on the ground.",
    "For some time she sat quite still her eyes half\nclosed.",
    "Wonderful she thought to feel this peace and quiet oozing into her.",
    "She could simply\nfeel the good it was doing her.",
    "The healing air the lovely warm sun \u2013 the peace of it all.",
    "She remained so for a little longer.",
    "Then she glanced at her watch.",
    "It was ten minutes\npast ten.",
    "She thought The morning is passing quite quickly \u2026\nSupposing she were to write a line to Barbara Really it was extraordinary that she\nhadn\u2019t thought of writing to Barbara yesterday instead of those silly letters to friends in\nEngland.",
    "She got out the pad and her pen.",
    "\u2018Darling Barbara\u2019 she wrote.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m not having a very lucky journey.",
    "Missed\nMonday night\u2019s train and now I\u2019m held up here for days apparently.",
    "It\u2019s very\npeaceful and lovely sunshine so I\u2019m quite happy.\u2019\nShe paused.",
    "What to say next.",
    "Something about the baby \u2013 or William What on earth\ncould Blanche have meant \u2013 \u2018don\u2019t worry about Barbara\u2019.",
    "Of course That was why Joan\nhadn\u2019t wanted to think about Blanche.",
    "Blanche had been so peculiar in the things she had\nsaid about Barbara.",
    "As though she Barbara\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t know anything there was to know about\nher own child.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be all right now.\u2019 Did that mean that things hadn\u2019t been all right\n\n\fBut in what way Blanche had hinted that Barbara was too young to have married.",
    "Joan stirred uneasily.",
    "At the time she remembered Rodney had said something of the\nkind.",
    "He had said quite suddenly and in an unusually peremptory way\n\u2018I\u2019m not happy about this marriage Joan.\u2019\n\u2018Oh Rodney but why He\u2019s so nice and they seem so well suited.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s a nice enough young fellow \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t love him Joan.\u2019\nShe\u2019d been astonished \u2013 absolutely astonished.",
    "\u2018Rodney \u2013 really \u2013 how ridiculous Of course she\u2019s in love with him Why on earth\nwould she want to marry him otherwise\u2019\nHe had answered \u2013 rather obscurely \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u2019\n\u2018But darling \u2013 really \u2013 aren\u2019t you being a little ridiculous\u2019\nHe had said paying no attention to her purposely light tone \u2018If she doesn\u2019t love him\nshe mustn\u2019t marry him.",
    "She\u2019s too young for that \u2013 and she\u2019s got too much temperament.\u2019\n\u2018Well really Rodney what do you know about temperament\u2019\nShe couldn\u2019t help being amused.",
    "But Rodney didn\u2019t even smile.",
    "He said \u2018Girls do marry sometimes \u2013 just to get away\nfrom home.\u2019\nAt that she had laughed outright.",
    "\u2018Not homes like Barbara\u2019s Why no girl ever had a happier home life.\u2019\n\u2018Do you really think that\u2019s true Joan\u2019\n\u2018Why of course.",
    "Everything\u2019s always been perfect for the children here.\u2019\n\u2018He said slowly \u2018They don\u2019t seem to bring their friends to the house much.\u2019\n\u2018Why darling I\u2019m always giving parties and asking young people I make a point of\nit.",
    "It\u2019s Barbara herself who\u2019s always saying she doesn\u2019t want parties and not to ask\npeople.\u2019\nRodney had shaken his head in a puzzled unsatisfied way.",
    "And later that evening she had come into the room just as Barbara was crying out\nimpatiently\n\u2018It\u2019s no good Daddy I\u2019ve got to get away.",
    "I can\u2019t stand it any longer \u2013 and don\u2019t tell\nme to go and take a job somewhere because I should hate that.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s all this\u2019 Joan said.",
    "After a pause a very slight pause Barbara had explained a mutinous flush on her\ncheek.",
    "\u2018Just Daddy thinking he knows best He wants me to be engaged for years.",
    "I\u2019ve told\nhim I can\u2019t stand that and I want to marry William and go away to Baghdad.",
    "I think it will\nbe wonderful out there.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Oh dear\u2019 said Joan anxiously.",
    "\u2018I wish it wasn\u2019t so far away.",
    "I\u2019d like to have you under\nmy eye as it were.\u2019\n\u2018Oh Mother\u2019\n\u2018I know darling but you don\u2019t realize how young you are how inexperienced.",
    "I\nshould be able to help you so much if you were living somewhere not too far away.\u2019\nBarbara had smiled and had said \u2018Well it looks as though I shall have to paddle my\nown canoe without the benefit of your experience and wisdom.\u2019\nAnd as Rodney was going slowly out of the room she had rushed after him and had\nsuddenly flung her arms round his neck hugging him and saying \u2018Darling Dads.",
    "Darling\ndarling darling \u2026\u2019\nReally thought Joan the child is becoming quite demonstrative.",
    "But it showed at any\nrate how entirely wrong Rodney was in his ideas.",
    "Barbara was just revelling in the\nthought of going out East with her William \u2013 and very nice it was to see two young things\nin love and so full of plans for the future.",
    "Extraordinary that an idea should have got about Baghdad that Barbara had been\nunhappy at home.",
    "But it was a place that seemed absolutely full of gossip and rumours so\nmuch so that one hardly liked to mention anyone.",
    "Major Reid for instance.",
    "She herself had never met Major Reid but he had been mentioned quite often in\nBarbara\u2019s letters home.",
    "Major Reid had been to dinner.",
    "They were going shooting with\nMajor Reid.",
    "Barbara was going for the summer months up to Arkandous.",
    "She and another\nyoung married woman had shared a bungalow and Major Reid had been up there at the\nsame time.",
    "They had had a lot of tennis.",
    "Later Barbara and he had won the mixed doubles\nat the club.",
    "So it had really been quite natural for Joan to ask brightly about Major Reid \u2013 she had\nheard so much about him she said that she was really longing to see him.",
    "It was quite ludicrous the embarrassment her question had caused.",
    "Barbara had turned\nquite white and William had gone red and after a minute or two he had grunted out in a\nvery odd voice\n\u2018We don\u2019t see anything of him now.\u2019\nHis manner had been so forbidding that she really hadn\u2019t liked to say anything more.",
    "But afterwards when Barbara had gone to bed Joan reopened the subject saying smilingly\nthat she seemed to have put her foot in it.",
    "She\u2019d had an idea that Major Reid was quite an\nintimate friend.",
    "William got up and tapped his pipe against the fireplace.",
    "\u2018Oh I dunno\u2019 he said vaguely.",
    "\u2018We did a bit of shooting together and all that.",
    "But we\nhaven\u2019t seen anything of him for a long time now.\u2019\nIt wasn\u2019t Joan thought very well done.",
    "She had smiled to herself men were so\ntransparent.",
    "She was a little amused at William\u2019s oldfashioned reticence.",
    "He probably\nthought of her as a very prim straitlaced woman \u2013 a regular motherinlaw.",
    "\u2018I see\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Some scandal.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean\u2019 William had turned on her quite angrily.",
    "\u2018My dear boy\u2019 Joan smiled at him.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s quite obvious from your manner.",
    "I suppose\nyou found out something about him and had to drop him.",
    "Oh I shan\u2019t ask questions.",
    "These\nthings are very painful I know.\u2019\nWilliam said slowly \u2018Yes \u2013 yes you\u2019re right.",
    "They are painful.\u2019\n\u2018One takes people so much at their own valuation\u2019 said Joan.",
    "\u2018And then when one\nfinds out that one has been mistaken in them it\u2019s all so awkward and unpleasant.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s cleared out of this country that\u2019s one good thing\u2019 said William.",
    "\u2018Gone to East\nAfrica.\u2019\nAnd suddenly Joan remembered some scraps of conversation overheard one day at the\nAlwyah Club.",
    "Something about Nobby Reid going to Uganda.",
    "A woman had said \u2018Poor Nobby it\u2019s really not his fault that every little idiot in the\nplace runs after him.\u2019\nAnd another older woman had laughed spitefully and said \u2018He takes a lot of trouble\nwith them.",
    "Dewy innocents \u2013 that\u2019s what Nobby likes.",
    "The unsophisticated bride.",
    "And I\nmust say he has a wonderful technique He can be terribly attractive.",
    "The girl always\nthinks he\u2019s passionately in love with her.",
    "That\u2019s usually the moment when he\u2019s just\nthinking of passing on to the next one.\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019 said the first woman.",
    "\u2018We shall all miss him.",
    "He\u2019s so amusing.\u2019\nThe other laughed.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s a husband or two who won\u2019t be sorry to see him go As a matter of fact very\nfew men like him.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s certainly made this place too hot to hold him.\u2019\nThen the second woman had said \u2018Hush\u2019 and lowered her voice and Joan hadn\u2019t\nheard any more.",
    "She had hardly noticed the conversation at the time but it came back to\nher now and she felt curious.",
    "If William didn\u2019t want to talk about it perhaps Barbara might be less reticent.",
    "But instead of that Barbara had said quite clearly and rather disagreeably\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about him Mother do you mind\u2019\nBarbara Joan reflected never did want to talk about anything.",
    "She had been quite\nincredibly reticent and touchy about her illness and its cause.",
    "Some form of poisoning had\nstarted it all and naturally Joan had taken it to be food poisoning of some kind.",
    "Ptomaine\npoisoning was very common in hot climates so she believed.",
    "But both William and\nBarbara had been most unwilling to go into details \u2013 and even the doctor to whom she had\nnaturally applied for information as Barbara\u2019s mother had been taciturn and\nuncommunicative.",
    "His principal care was to stress the point that young Mrs Wray must\nnot be questioned or encouraged to dwell on her illness.",
    "\u2018All she needs now is care and building up.",
    "Whys and wherefores are very\nunprofitable subjects of discussion and talking about all that will do the patient no good.",
    "That\u2019s just a hint I\u2019m giving you Mrs Scudamore.\u2019\nAn unpleasant dour kind of man Joan had found him and not at all impressed as he\neasily might have been by the devotion of a mother in rushing out from England post\nhaste.",
    "Oh well Barbara had been grateful at all events.",
    "At least Joan supposed so \u2026 She had\ncertainly thanked her mother very prettily.",
    "William too had said how good of her it was.",
    "She had said how she wished she could have stayed on and William had said Yes he\nwished so too.",
    "And she had said now they mustn\u2019t press her \u2013 because it was really too\ntempting and she\u2019d love to have a winter in Baghdad \u2013 but after all there was Barbara\u2019s\nfather to consider and it wouldn\u2019t be fair on him.",
    "And Barbara in a faint little voice had said \u2018Darling Dads\u2019 and after a moment or two\nhad said \u2018Look here Mother why don\u2019t you stay\u2019\n\u2018You must think of your father darling.\u2019\nBarbara said in that rather curious dry voice she used sometimes that she was thinking\nof him but Joan said no she couldn\u2019t leave poor dear Rodney to servants.",
    "There was a moment a few days before her departure when she had almost changed\nher mind.",
    "She might at any rate stay another month.",
    "But William had pointed out so\neloquently the uncertainties of desert travel if she left it too late in the season that she had\nbeen quite alarmed and had decided that it was best to stick to her original plan.",
    "After that\nWilliam and Barbara had been so nice to her that she almost changed her mind again \u2013 but\nnot quite.",
    "Though really however late in the season she had left it nothing could be much worse\nthan this.",
    "Joan looked at her watch again.",
    "Five minutes to eleven.",
    "One seemed to be able to think\na great deal in quite a short space of time.",
    "She rather wished she\u2019d brought The Power House out here with her though perhaps\nas it was the only thing she had to read it was wise to keep it back \u2013 something in reserve.",
    "Two hours to put in before lunch time.",
    "She had said she would have lunch at one\no\u2019clock today.",
    "Perhaps she had better walk on a little only it seemed rather silly just\nwalking aimlessly with nowhere particular to walk to.",
    "And the sun was quite hot.",
    "Oh well how often she had wished she could have just a little time to herself to think\nthings out.",
    "Now if ever was her opportunity.",
    "What things were there that she had wanted\nto think out so urgently\nJoan searched her mind \u2013 but they seemed mostly to have been matters of local\nimportance \u2013 remembering where she had put this that or the other deciding how to\narrange the servants\u2019 summer holidays planning the redecorating of the old schoolroom.",
    "All these things seemed now rather remote and unimportant.",
    "November was rather far\nin advance to plan the servants\u2019 holidays and besides she had to know when Whitsuntide\n\n\fwas and that needed next year\u2019s almanac.",
    "She could however decide about the\nschoolroom.",
    "The walls a light shade of beige and oatmeal covers with some nice bright\ncushions Yes that would do very well.",
    "Ten minutes past eleven.",
    "Redecorating and doing up the schoolroom hadn\u2019t taken\nlong\nJoan thought vaguely If I\u2019d only known I could have brought along some interesting\nbook on modern science and discoveries something that would explain things like the\nquantum theory.",
    "And then she wondered what had put the quantum theory into her head and thought to\nherself Of course \u2013 the covers \u2013 and Mrs Sherston.",
    "For she remembered that she had once been discussing the vexed questions of chintzes\nor cretonnes for drawingroom covers with Mrs Sherston the bank manager\u2019s wife \u2013 and\nright in the middle of it Mrs Sherston had said in her abrupt way \u2018I do wish I was clever\nenough to understand the quantum theory.",
    "It\u2019s such a fascinating idea isn\u2019t it energy all\ndone up in little parcels.\u2019\nJoan had stared at her for she really couldn\u2019t see what scientific theories had to do\nwith chintzes and Mrs Sherston had got rather red and said \u2018Stupid of me but you know\nthe way things come into your head quite suddenly \u2013 and it is an exciting idea isn\u2019t it\u2019\nJoan hadn\u2019t thought the idea particularly exciting and the conversation had ended\nthere.",
    "But she remembered quite well Mrs Sherston\u2019s own cretonne \u2013 or rather handprinted linen covers.",
    "A design of leaves in browns and greys and reds.",
    "She had said\n\u2018These are very unusual were they very expensive\u2019 And Mrs Sherston had said yes they\nwere.",
    "And she had added that she had got them because she loved woods and trees and the\ndream of her life was to go somewhere like Burma or Malaya where things grew really\nfast Really fast she had added in an anxious tone and making a rather clumsy gesture\nwith her hands to express impatience.",
    "Those linens reflected Joan now must have cost at least eighteen and six a yard a\nfantastic price for those days.",
    "One ought by realizing what Captain Sherston gave his wife\nfor housekeeping and furnishing to have had at least an inkling of what was to come out\nlater.",
    "She herself had never really liked the man.",
    "She remembered sitting in his office at the\nbank discussing the reinvestment of some shares Sherston opposite her behind his desk \u2013\na great big breezy man exuding bonhomie.",
    "A rather exaggeratedly social manner \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m a\nman of the world dear lady\u2019 he seemed to be saying \u2018don\u2019t think of me as just a money\nmachine \u2013 I\u2019m a tennis player a golfer a dancer a bridge player.",
    "The real me is the chap\nyou meet at a party not the official who says \u201cno further overdraft\u201d.\u2019\nA great overblown windbag thought Joan indignantly.",
    "Crooked always crooked.",
    "Even\nthen he must have started on his falsification of the books or whatever the swindle was.",
    "And yet nearly everyone had liked him had said what a good sort old Sherston was not at\nall the usual type of bank manager.",
    "Well that was true enough.",
    "The usual type of bank manager doesn\u2019t embezzle bank\nfunds.",
    "Well Leslie Sherston had at any rate got her handprinted linen covers out of it all.",
    "Not that anyone had ever suggested that an extravagant wife had led to Sherston\u2019s\ndishonesty.",
    "You only had to look at Leslie Sherston to see that money meant nothing\nparticularly to her.",
    "Always wearing shabby green tweeds and grubbing around in her\ngarden or tramping through the countryside.",
    "She never bothered much about the children\u2019s\nclothes either.",
    "And once much later Joan remembered an afternoon when Leslie Sherston\nhad given her tea fetching a big loaf and a roll of butter and some homemade jam and\nkitchen cups and teapots \u2013 everything bundled anyhow on a tray and brought in.",
    "An\nuntidy cheerful careless sort of woman with a onesided slouch when she walked and a\nface that seemed all on one side too but that onesided smile of hers was rather nice and\npeople liked her on the whole.",
    "Ah well poor Mrs Sherston.",
    "She\u2019d had a sad life a very sad life.",
    "Joan moved restlessly.",
    "Why had she let that phrase a sad life come into her mind It\nreminded her of Blanche Haggard though that was quite a different kind of sad life and\nthinking of Blanche brought her back again to Barbara and the circumstances surrounding\nBarbara\u2019s illness.",
    "Was there nothing one could think of that did not lead in some painful\nand undesired direction\nShe looked at her watch once more.",
    "At any rate handprinted linens and poor Mrs\nSherston had taken up nearly half an hour.",
    "What could she think about now Something\npleasant with no disturbing sidelines.",
    "Rodney was probably the safest subject to think about.",
    "Dear Rodney.",
    "Joan\u2019s mind\ndwelt pleasurably on the thought of her husband visualizing him as she had last seen him\non the platform at Victoria saying goodbye to her just before the train pulled out.",
    "Yes dear Rodney.",
    "Standing there looking up at her the sun shining full on his face and\nrevealing so mercilessly the network of little lines at the corners of his eyes \u2013 such tired\neyes.",
    "Yes tired eyes eyes full of a deep sadness.",
    "Not she thought that Rodney is sad.",
    "It\u2019s\njust a trick of construction.",
    "Some animals have sad eyes.",
    "Usually too he was wearing his\nglasses and then you didn\u2019t notice the sadness of his eyes.",
    "But he certainly looked a very\ntired man.",
    "No wonder when he worked so hard.",
    "He practically never took a day off.",
    "I\nshall change all that when I get back thought Joan.",
    "He must have more leisure.",
    "I ought to\nhave thought of it before.",
    "Yes seen there in the bright light he looked as old or older than his years.",
    "She had\nlooked down on him and he up at her and they had exchanged the usual idiotic last words.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think you have to go through any Customs at Calais.\u2019\n\u2018No I believe one goes straight through to the Simplon express.\u2019\n\u2018Brindisi carriage remember.",
    "I hope the Mediterranean behaves.\u2019\n\u2018I wish I could stop off a day or two in Cairo.\u2019\n\u2018Why don\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018Darling I must hurry to Barbara.",
    "It\u2019s only a weekly air service.\u2019\n\u2018Of course.",
    "I forgot.\u2019\n\n\fA whistle blew.",
    "He smiled up at her.",
    "\u2018Take care of yourself little Joan.\u2019\n\u2018Goodbye don\u2019t miss me too much.\u2019\nThe train started with a jerk.",
    "Joan drew her head in.",
    "Rodney waved then turned away.",
    "On an impulse she leaned out again.",
    "He was already striding up the platform.",
    "She felt a sudden thrill at seeing that wellknown back.",
    "How young he looked\nsuddenly his head thrown back his shoulders squared.",
    "It gave her quite a shock \u2026\nShe had an impression of a young carefree man striding up the platform.",
    "It reminded her of the day she had first met Rodney Scudamore.",
    "She had been introduced to him at a tennis party and they had gone straight on to the\ncourt.",
    "He had said \u2018Shall I play at the net\u2019\nAnd it was then that she had looked after him as he strode up to take his place at the\nnet and thought what a very attractive back he had \u2026 the easy confident way he walked\nthe set of his head and neck \u2026\nSuddenly she had been nervous.",
    "She had served two lots of double faults running and\nhad felt all hot and bothered.",
    "And then Rodney had turned his head and smiled at her encouragingly \u2013 that kind\nfriendly smile of his.",
    "And she had thought what a very attractive young man \u2026 and she\nhad proceeded straight away to fall in love with him.",
    "Looking out from the train watching Rodney\u2019s retreating back until the sight of it was\nblotted out by the people on the platform she relived that summer\u2019s day so many years\nago.",
    "It was as though the years had fallen away from Rodney leaving him once more an\neager confident young man.",
    "As though the years had fallen away \u2026\nSuddenly in the desert with the sun pouring down on her Joan gave a quick\nuncontrollable shiver.",
    "She thought No no \u2013 I don\u2019t want to go on \u2013 I don\u2019t want to think about this \u2026\nRodney striding up the platform his head thrown back the tired sag of his shoulders\nall gone.",
    "A man who had been relieved of an intolerable burden \u2026\nReally what was the matter with her She was imagining things inventing them.",
    "Her\neyes had played a trick on her.",
    "Why hadn\u2019t he waited to see the train pull out\nWell why should he He was in a hurry to get through what business he had to do in\nLondon.",
    "Some people didn\u2019t like to see trains go out of stations bearing away someone\nthey loved.",
    "Really it was impossible that anyone could remember so clearly as she did exactly\nhow Rodney\u2019s back had looked\nShe was imagining \u2013\nStop that didn\u2019t make it any better.",
    "If you imagined a thing like that it meant that such\nan idea was already in your head.",
    "And it couldn\u2019t be true \u2013 the inference that she had drawn simply could not be true.",
    "She was saying to herself wasn\u2019t she that Rodney was glad she was going away \u2026\nAnd that simply couldn\u2019t be true\n\n\fChapter Four\nJoan arrived back at the rest house definitely overheated.",
    "Unconsciously she had increased\nher pace so as to get away from that last unwelcome thought.",
    "The Indian looked at her curiously and said\n\u2018Memsahib walk very fast.",
    "Why walk fast Plenty time here.\u2019\nOh God thought Joan plenty time indeed\nThe Indian and the rest house and the chickens and the tins and the barbed wire were\nall definitely getting on her nerves.",
    "She went on into her bedroom and found The Power House.",
    "At any rate she thought it\u2019s cool in here and dark.",
    "She opened The Power House and began to read.",
    "By lunch time she had read half of it.",
    "There was omelette for lunch and baked beans round it and after it there was a dish of\nhot salmon with rice and tinned apricots.",
    "Joan did not eat very much.",
    "Afterwards she went to her bedroom and lay down.",
    "If she had a touch of the sun from walking too fast in the heat a sleep would do her\ngood.",
    "She closed her eyes but sleep did not come.",
    "She felt particularly wide awake and intelligent.",
    "She got up and took three aspirins and lay down again.",
    "Every time she shut her eyes she saw Rodney\u2019s back going away from her up the\nplatform.",
    "It was insupportable\nShe pulled aside the curtain to let in some light and got The Power House.",
    "A few\npages before the end she dropped asleep.",
    "She dreamt that she was going to play in a tournament with Rodney.",
    "They had\ndifficulty in finding the balls but at last they got to the court.",
    "When she started to serve she\nfound that she was playing against Rodney and the Randolph girl.",
    "She served nothing but\ndouble faults.",
    "She thought Rodney will help me but when she looked for him she could\nnot find him.",
    "Everyone had left and it was getting dark.",
    "I\u2019m all alone thought Joan.",
    "I\u2019m all\nalone.",
    "She woke up with a start.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m all alone\u2019 she said aloud.",
    "The influence of the dream was still upon her.",
    "It seemed to her that the words she had\njust said were terribly frightening.",
    "She said again \u2018I\u2019m all alone.\u2019\nThe Indian put his head in.",
    "\u2018Memsahib call\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Get me some tea.\u2019\n\u2018Memsahib want tea Only three o\u2019clock.\u2019\n\u2018Never mind I want tea.\u2019\nShe heard him going away and calling out \u2018Chaichai\u2019\nShe got up from the bed and went over to the flyspotted mirror.",
    "It was reassuring to\nsee her own normal pleasantlooking face.",
    "\u2018I wonder\u2019 said Joan addressing her reflection \u2018whether you can be going to be ill\nYou\u2019re behaving very oddly.\u2019\nPerhaps she had got a touch of the sun\nWhen the tea came she was feeling quite normal again.",
    "In fact the whole business was\nreally very funny.",
    "She Joan Scudamore indulging in nerves But of course it wasn\u2019t\nnerves it was a touch of the sun.",
    "She wouldn\u2019t go out again until the sun was well down.",
    "She ate some biscuits and drank two cups of tea.",
    "Then she finished The Power House.",
    "As she closed the book she was assailed by a definite qualm.",
    "She thought Now I\u2019ve got nothing to read.",
    "Nothing to read no writing materials no sewing with her.",
    "Nothing at all to do but\nwait for a problematical train that mightn\u2019t come for days.",
    "When the Indian came in to clear tea away she said to him\n\u2018What do you do here\u2019\nHe seemed surprised by the question.",
    "\u2018I look after travellers Memsahib.\u2019\n\u2018I know.\u2019 She controlled her impatience.",
    "\u2018But that doesn\u2019t take you all your time\u2019\n\u2018I give them breakfast lunch tea.\u2019\n\u2018No no I don\u2019t mean that.",
    "You have helpers\u2019\n\u2018Arab boy \u2013 very stupid very lazy very dirty \u2013 I see to everything myself not trust\nboy.",

    "You can\u2019t talk to them.",
    "They don\u2019t know what you mean.",
    "This man he\u2019s here always month after month.",
    "Sometimes I suppose he gets a holiday\nand goes to a town and gets drunk and sees friends.",
    "But for weeks on end he\u2019s here.",
    "Of\ncourse he\u2019s got the cook and the boy \u2026 The boy lies in the sun and sleeps when he isn\u2019t\nworking.",
    "Life\u2019s as simple as that for him.",
    "They\u2019re no good to me not any of them.",
    "All the\nEnglish this man knows is eating and drinking and \u2018Nice weather.\u2019\nThe Indian went out.",
    "Joan strolled restlessly about the room.",
    "\u2018I mustn\u2019t be foolish.",
    "I must make some kind of plan.",
    "Arrange a course of \u2013 of\nthinking for myself.",
    "I really must not allow myself to get \u2013 well \u2013 rattled.\u2019\nThe truth was she reflected that she had always led such a full and occupied life.",
    "So\nmuch interest in it.",
    "It was a civilized life.",
    "And if you had all that balance and proportion in\nyour life it certainly left you rather at a loss when you were faced with the barren\nuselessness of doing nothing at all.",
    "The more useful and cultured a woman you were the\nmore difficult it made it.",
    "There were some people of course even at home who often sat about for hours doing\nnothing.",
    "Presumably they would take to this kind of life quite happily.",
    "Even Mrs Sherston though as a rule she was active and energetic enough for two had\noccasionally sat about doing nothing.",
    "Usually when she was out for walks.",
    "She would\nwalk with terrific energy and then drop down suddenly on a log of wood or a patch of\nheather and just sit there staring into space.",
    "Like that day when she Joan had thought it was the Randolph girl \u2026\nShe blushed slightly as she remembered her own actions.",
    "It had really been rather like spying.",
    "The sort of thing that made her just a little\nashamed.",
    "Because she wasn\u2019t really that kind of woman.",
    "Still with a girl like Myrna Randolph \u2026\nA girl who didn\u2019t seem to have any moral sense \u2026\nJoan tried to remember how it had all come about.",
    "She had been taking some flowers to old Mrs Garnett and had just come out of the\ncottage door when she had heard Rodney\u2019s voice in the road outside the hedge.",
    "His voice\nand a woman\u2019s voice answering him.",
    "She had said goodbye to Mrs Garnett quickly and come out into the road.",
    "She was just\nable to catch sight of Rodney and she felt sure the Randolph girl swinging round the\ncorner of the track that led up to Asheldown.",
    "No she wasn\u2019t very proud of what she had done then.",
    "But she had felt at the time that\nshe had to know.",
    "It wasn\u2019t exactly Rodney\u2019s fault \u2013 everyone knew what Myrna Randolph\nwas.",
    "Joan had taken the path that went up through Haling Wood and had come out that way\non to the bare shoulder of Asheldown and at once she had caught sight of them \u2013 two\nfigures sitting there motionless staring down over the pale shining countryside below.",
    "The relief when she had seen that it wasn\u2019t Myrna Randolph at all but Mrs Sherston\nThey weren\u2019t even sitting close together.",
    "There were four feet at least between them.",
    "Really a quite ridiculous distance \u2013 hardly friendly But then Leslie Sherston wasn\u2019t really\na very friendly person \u2013 not that is a demonstrative one.",
    "And she certainly could not be\nregarded as a siren \u2013 the mere idea would have been ludicrous.",
    "No she had been out on\none of her tramps and Rodney had overtaken her and with his usual friendly courtesy had\naccompanied her.",
    "Now having climbed up Asheldown Ridge they were resting for a while and enjoying\nthe view before going back again.",
    "Astonishing really the way that neither of them moved nor spoke.",
    "Not she thought\nvery companionable.",
    "Oh well presumably they both had their own thoughts.",
    "They felt\nperhaps that they knew each other well enough not to have to bother to talk or to make\nconversation.",
    "For by that time the Scudamores had got to know Leslie Sherston very much better.",
    "The bombshell of Sherston\u2019s defalcations had burst upon a dismayed Crayminster and\nSherston himself was by now serving his prison sentence.",
    "Rodney was the solicitor who\nhad acted for him at the trial and who also acted for Leslie.",
    "He had been very sorry for\nLeslie left with two small children and no money.",
    "Everybody had been prepared to be\nsorry for poor Mrs Sherston and if they had not gone on being quite so sorry that was\nentirely Leslie Sherston\u2019s own fault.",
    "Her resolute cheerfulness had rather shocked some\npeople.",
    "\u2018She must I think\u2019 Joan had said to Rodney \u2018be rather insensitive.\u2019\nHe had replied brusquely that Leslie Sherston had more courage than anyone he had\never come across.",
    "Joan had said \u2018Oh yes courage.",
    "But courage isn\u2019t everything\u2019\n\u2018Isn\u2019t it\u2019 Rodney had said.",
    "He\u2019d said it rather queerly.",
    "Then he\u2019d gone off to the\noffice.",
    "Courage was a virtue one would certainly not deny to Leslie Sherston.",
    "Faced with the\nproblem of supporting herself and two children and with no particular qualifications for\nthe task she had managed it.",
    "She\u2019d gone to work at a market gardener\u2019s until she was thoroughly conversant with\nthe trade accepting in the meantime a small allowance from an aunt and living with the\nchildren in rooms.",
    "Thus when Sherston had come out of prison he\u2019d found her\nestablished in a different part of the world altogether growing fruit and vegetables for the\nmarket.",
    "He\u2019d driven the truck in and out from the nearby town and the children had\nhelped and they\u2019d managed somehow to make not too bad a thing of it.",
    "There was no\ndoubt that Mrs Sherston had worked like a Trojan and it was particularly meritorious\nbecause she must at that time have begun to suffer a good deal of pain from the illness\nthat eventually killed her.",
    "Oh well thought Joan presumably she loved the man.",
    "Sherston had certainly been\nconsidered a goodlooking man and a favourite with women.",
    "He looked rather different\nwhen he came out of prison.",
    "She Joan had only seen him once but she was shocked by\nthe change in him.",
    "Shiftyeyed deflated still boastful still attempting to bluff and bluster.",
    "A wreck of a man.",
    "Still his wife had loved him and stuck by him and for that Joan\nrespected Leslie Sherston.",
    "She had on the other hand considered that Leslie had been absolutely wrong about\nthe children.",
    "That same aunt who had come to the rescue financially when Sherston was convicted\nhad made a further offer when he was due to come out of prison.",
    "She would she said adopt the younger boy and an uncle persuaded by her would\npay the school fees of the elder boy and she herself would take them both for the holidays.",
    "They could take the uncle\u2019s name by deed poll and she and the uncle would make\nthemselves financially responsible for their future.",
    "Leslie Sherston had turned this offer down unconditionally and in that Joan thought\nshe had been selfish.",
    "She was refusing for her children a much better life than she could\ngive them and one free from any taint of disgrace.",
    "However much she loved her boys she ought Joan thought and Rodney agreed with\nher to think of their lives before her own.",
    "But Leslie had been quite unyielding and Rodney had washed his hands of the whole\nmatter.",
    "He supposed he had said with a sigh that Mrs Sherston knew her own business\nbest.",
    "Certainly Joan thought she was an obstinate creature.",
    "Walking restlessly up and down the rest house floor Joan remembered Leslie Sherston as\nshe had looked that day sitting on Asheldown Ridge.",
    "Sitting hunched forward her elbows on her knees her chin supported on her hands.",
    "Sitting curiously still.",
    "Looking out across the farmland and the plough to where slopes of\noaks and beeches in Little Havering wood were turning golden red.",
    "She and Rodney sitting there \u2013 so quiet \u2013 so motionless \u2013 staring in front of them.",
    "Quite why she did not speak to them or join them Joan hardly knew.",
    "Perhaps it was the guilty consciousness of her suspicions of Myrna Randolph\nAnyhow she had not spoken to them.",
    "Instead she had gone quietly back into the shelter\nof the trees and had taken her way home.",
    "It was an incident that she had never liked very\nmuch to think about \u2013 and she had certainly never mentioned it to Rodney.",
    "He might think\nshe had ideas in her head ideas about him and Myrna Randolph.",
    "Rodney walking up the platform at Victoria \u2026\nOh goodness surely she wasn\u2019t going to begin that all over again\nWhat on earth had put that extraordinary notion into her head That Rodney who was\nand always had been devoted to her was enjoying the prospect of her absence\nAs though you could tell anything by the way a man walked\n\n\fShe would simply put the whole ridiculous fancy out of her mind.",
    "She wouldn\u2019t think any more about Rodney not if it made her imagine such curious\nand unpleasant things.",
    "Up to now she\u2019d never been a fanciful woman.",
    "It must be the sun.",
    "Chapter Five\nThe afternoon and evening passed with interminable slowness.",
    "Joan didn\u2019t like to go out in the sun again until it was quite low in the sky.",
    "So she sat in\nthe rest house.",
    "After about half an hour she felt it unendurable to sit still in a chair.",
    "She went into the\nbedroom and began to unpack her cases and repack them.",
    "Her things so she told herself\nwere not properly folded.",
    "She might as well make a good job of it.",
    "She finished the job neatly and expeditiously.",
    "It was five o\u2019clock.",
    "She might safely go\nout now surely.",
    "It was so depressing in the rest house.",
    "If only she had something to\nread \u2026\nOr even thought Joan desperately a wire puzzle\nOutside she looked with distaste at the tins and the hens and the barbed wire.",
    "What a\nhorrible place this was.",
    "Utterly horrible.",
    "She walked for a change in a direction parallel with the railway line and the Turkish\nfrontier.",
    "It gave her a feeling of agreeable novelty.",
    "But after a quarter of an hour the effect\nwas the same.",
    "The railway line running a quarter of a mile to her right gave her no\nfeeling of companionship.",
    "Nothing but silence \u2013 silence and sunlight.",
    "It occurred to Joan that she might recite poetry.",
    "She had always been supposed as a girl\nto recite and read poetry very well.",
    "Interesting to see what she could remember after all\nthese years.",
    "There was a time when she had known quite a lot of poetry by heart.",
    "The quality of mercy is not strained\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\nWhat came next Stupid.",
    "She simply couldn\u2019t remember.",
    "Fear no more the heat of the sun\nThat began comfortingly anyway Now how did it go on\nNor the furious winter\u2019s rages\nThou thy worldly task has done\nHome art gone and ta\u2019en thy wages\nGolden lads and girls all must\nAs chimney sweepers come to dust.",
    "No not very cheerful on the whole.",
    "Could she remember any of the sonnets She used\nto know them.",
    "The marriage of true minds and that one that Rodney had asked her about.",
    "Funny the way he had said suddenly one evening\n\u2018And thy eternal summer shall not fade \u2013 that\u2019s from Shakespeare isn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018Yes from the sonnets.\u2019\nAnd he had said\n\u2018Let me not unto the marriage of true minds admit impediment That one\u2019\n\u2018No the one that begins Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day.\u2019\nAnd then she had quoted the whole sonnet to him really rather beautifully with a lot\nof expression and all the proper emphasis.",
    "At the end instead of expressing approbation he had only repeated thoughtfully\n\u2018Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May \u2026 but it\u2019s October now isn\u2019t it\u2019\nIt was such an extraordinary thing to say that she had stared at him.",
    "Then he had said\n\u2018Do you know the other one The one about the marriage of true minds\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019 She paused a minute and then began\n\u2018Let me not to the marriage of true minds\nAdmit impediments.",
    "Love is not love\nWhich alters where it alteration finds\nOr bends with the remover to remove\nO no it is an everfixed mark\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken\nIt is the star to every wandering bark\nWhose worth\u2019s unknown although his height be taken.",
    "Love\u2019s not Time\u2019s fool though rosy lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle\u2019s compass come\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.",
    "If this be error and upon me prov\u2019d\nI never writ nor no man ever lov\u2019d.\u2019\nShe finished giving the last lines full emphasis and dramatic fervour.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t you think I recite Shakespeare rather well I was always supposed to at school.",
    "They said I read poetry with a lot of expression.\u2019\nBut Rodney had only answered absently \u2018It doesn\u2019t really need expression.",
    "Just the\nwords will do.\u2019\nShe had sighed and murmured \u2018Shakespeare is wonderful isn\u2019t he\u2019\n\n\fAnd Rodney had answered \u2018What\u2019s really so wonderful is that he was just a poor\ndevil like the rest of us.\u2019\n\u2018Rodney what an extraordinary thing to say.\u2019\nHe had smiled at her then as though waking up.",
    "\u2018Is it\u2019\nGetting up he had strolled out of the room murmuring as he went\n\u2018Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May And summer\u2019s lease hath all too short\na date.\u2019\nWhy on earth she wondered had he said \u2018But it\u2019s October now\u2019\nWhat could he have been thinking about\nShe remembered that October a particularly fine and mild one.",
    "Curious now she came to think of it the evening that Rodney had asked her about the\nsonnets had been the actual evening of the day when she had seen him sitting with Mrs\nSherston on Asheldown.",
    "Perhaps Mrs Sherston had been quoting Shakespeare but it\nwasn\u2019t very likely.",
    "Leslie Sherston was not she thought at all an intellectual woman.",
    "It had been a wonderful October that year.",
    "She remembered quite plainly a few days later Rodney asking her in a bewildered\ntone\n\u2018Ought this thing to be out this time of year\u2019\nHe was pointing to a rhododendron.",
    "One of the early flowering ones that normally\nbloom in March or the end of February.",
    "It had a rich blood red blossom and the buds were\nbursting all over it.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 she had told him.",
    "\u2018Spring is the time but sometimes they do come out in autumn\nif it\u2019s unusually mild and warm.\u2019\nHe had touched one of the buds gently with his fingers and had murmured under his\nbreath\n\u2018The darling buds of May.\u2019\nMarch she told him not May.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s like blood\u2019 he said \u2018heart\u2019s blood.\u2019\nHow unlike Rodney she thought to be so interested in flowers.",
    "But after that he had always liked that particular rhododendron.",
    "She remembered how many years later he had worn a great bud of it in his\nbuttonhole.",
    "Much too heavy of course and it had fallen out as she knew it would.",
    "They\u2019d been in the churchyard of all extraordinary places at the time.",
    "She\u2019d seen him there as she came back past the church and had joined him and said\n\u2018Whatever are you doing here Rodney\u2019\n\n\fHe had laughed and said \u2018Considering my latter end and what I\u2019ll have put on my\ntombstone.",
    "Not granite chips I think they\u2019re so genteel.",
    "And certainly not a stout marble\nangel.\u2019\nThey had looked down then at a very new marble slab which bore Leslie Sherston\u2019s\nname.",
    "Following her glance Rodney had spelled out slowly\n\u2018Leslie Adeline Sherston dearly beloved wife of Charles Edward Sherston who\nentered into rest on 11th May 1930.",
    "And God shall wipe away their tears.\u2019\nThen after a moment\u2019s pause he had said\n\u2018Seems damned silly to think of Leslie Sherston under a cold slab of marble like that\nand only a congenital idiot like Sherston would ever have chosen that text.",
    "I don\u2019t believe\nLeslie ever cried in her life.\u2019\nJoan had said feeling just a little shocked and rather as though she was playing a\nslightly blasphemous game\n\u2018What would you choose\u2019\n\u2018For her I don\u2019t know.",
    "Isn\u2019t there something in the Psalms In thy presence is the\nfullness of joy.",
    "Something like that.\u2019\n\u2018I really meant for yourself.\u2019\n\u2018Oh for me\u2019 He thought for a minute or two \u2013 smiled to himself.",
    "\u2018The Lord is my\nshepherd.",
    "He leadeth me in green pastures.",
    "That will do very well for me.\u2019\n\u2018It sounds rather a dull idea of Heaven I\u2019ve always thought.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s your idea of Heaven Joan\u2019\n\u2018Well \u2013 not all the golden gates and that stuff of course.",
    "I like to think of it as a state.",
    "Where everyone is busy helping in some wonderful way to make this world perhaps\nmore beautiful and happier.",
    "Service \u2013 that\u2019s my idea of Heaven.\u2019\n\u2018What a dreadful little prig you are Joan.\u2019 He had laughed in his teasing way to rob the\nwords of their sting.",
    "Then he had said \u2018No a green valley \u2013 that\u2019s good enough for me \u2013\nand the sheep following the shepherd home in the cool of the evening \u2013\u2019\nHe paused a minute and then said \u2018It\u2019s an absurd fancy of mine Joan but I play with\nthe idea sometimes that as I\u2019m on my way to the office and go along the High Street I\nturn to take the alley into the Bell Walk and instead of the alley I\u2019ve turned into a hidden\nvalley with green pasture and soft wooded hills on either side.",
    "It\u2019s been there all the time\nexisting secretly in the heart of the town.",
    "You turn from the busy High Street into it and\nyou feel quite bewildered and say perhaps \u201cWhere am I\u201d And then they\u2019d tell you you\nknow very gently that you were dead \u2026\u2019\n\u2018Rodney\u2019 She was really startled dismayed.",
    "\u2018You \u2013 you\u2019re ill. You can\u2019t be well.\u2019\nIt had been her first inkling of the state he was in \u2013 the precursor of that nervous\nbreakdown that was shortly to send him for some two months to the sanatorium in\nCornwall where he seemed content to lie silently listening to the gulls and staring out over\n\n\fthe pale treeless hills to the sea.",
    "But she hadn\u2019t realized until that day in the churchyard that he really had been\noverworking.",
    "It was as they turned to go home she with an arm through his urging him\nforward that she saw the heavy rhododendron bud drop from his coat and fall on Leslie\u2019s\ngrave.",
    "\u2018Oh look\u2019 she said \u2018your rhododendron\u2019 and she stooped to pick it up.",
    "But he had\nsaid quickly\n\u2018Let it lie.",
    "Leave it there for Leslie Sherston.",
    "After all \u2013 she was our friend.\u2019\nAnd Joan had said quickly what a nice idea and that she would bring a big bunch of\nthose yellow chrysanthemums herself tomorrow.",
    "She had been she remembered a little frightened by the queer smile he gave her.",
    "Yes definitely she had felt that there was something wrong with Rodney that evening.",
    "She didn\u2019t of course realize that he was on the edge of a complete breakdown but she did\nknow that he was somehow different \u2026\nShe had plied him with anxious questions all the way home but he hadn\u2019t said much.",
    "Only repeated again and again\n\u2018I\u2019m tired Joan \u2026 I\u2019m very tired.\u2019\nAnd once incomprehensibly \u2018We can\u2019t all be brave \u2026\u2019\nIt was only about a week later that he had one morning said dreamily \u2018I shan\u2019t get up\ntoday.\u2019\nAnd he had lain there in bed not speaking or looking at anyone just lain there smiling\nquietly.",
    "And then there had been doctors and nurses and finally the arrangements for him to go\nfor a long rest cure to Trevelyan.",
    "No letters or telegrams and no visitors.",
    "They wouldn\u2019t\neven let Joan come and see him.",
    "Not his own wife.",

    "Father knows and he\u2019s promised me.\u2019\nShe stared at him taken aback shaken by his cool certainty.",
    "Then she sank into a chair tears came to her eyes.",
    "So unkind all of them browbeating\nher like this.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s come over you all \u2013 talking to me like this.",
    "If your father were\nhere \u2013 I think you are all behaving very unkindly\u2019\nTony had muttered something and turning had slouched out of the room.",
    "Averil in her dry voice said \u2018Tony\u2019s quite set on being a farmer Mother.",

    "I\u2019d much rather be a lawyer if I\nwas a man.",
    "I think the law is jolly interesting.\u2019\n\u2018I never thought\u2019 sobbed Joan \u2018that my children could be so unkind to me.\u2019\nAveril had sighed deeply.",
    "Barbara still sobbing hysterically in a corner of the room\n\n\fhad called out\n\u2018I know Daddy will die.",
    "I know he will \u2013 and then we\u2019ll be all alone in the world.",
    "I\ncan\u2019t bear it.",
    "Oh I can\u2019t bear it\u2019\nAveril sighed again looking with distaste from her frenziedly sobbing sister to her\ngently sobbing mother.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 she said \u2018if there isn\u2019t anything I can do \u2013\u2019\nAnd with that she had quietly and composedly left the room.",
    "Which was exactly like\nAveril.",
    "Altogether a most distressing and painful scene and one that Joan hadn\u2019t thought of\nfor years.",
    "Easily understandable of course.",
    "The sudden shock of their father\u2019s illness and the\nmystery of the words \u2018nervous breakdown\u2019.",

    "Both Tony and Barbara had apologized afterwards.",
    "Averil did not\nseem to think that there was anything for which she needed to apologize and perhaps\nfrom her own point of view she was justified.",
    "It wasn\u2019t the poor child\u2019s fault that she\nreally seemed to have been born without any heart.",
    "It had been a difficult unhappy time altogether while Rodney was away.",
    "The children\nhad sulked and been bad tempered.",
    "As far as possible they had kept out of her way and\nthat had made her feel curiously lonely.",
    "It was she supposed the effect of her own\nsadness and preoccupation.",

    "It sounds so badly to outside people.",
    "Yes thought Joan bringing up children was a thankless and difficult business.",

    "Knowing exactly when to be firm and when to give way.",

    "Well thought Joan wriggling her toes uneasily in her shoes because of the sand that\nhad got in it\u2019s perfectly true.",
    "Nobody does know what I went through at that time not\neven Rodney.",
    "For when Rodney had come back in the general relief everything had swung back to\nnormal and the children had been their own cheerful amiable selves again.",
    "Harmony had\nbeen restored.",
    "Which showed Joan thought that the whole thing had really been due to\nanxiety.",
    "Anxiety had made her lose her own poise.",
    "Anxiety had made the children nervous\nand bad tempered.",
    "A very upsetting time altogether and why she had got to select those\nparticular incidents to think about now \u2013 when what she wanted was happy memories and\nnot depressing ones \u2013 she really couldn\u2019t imagine.",
    "It had all started \u2013 what had it started from Of course \u2013 trying to remember poetry.",
    "Though really could anything be more ridiculous thought Joan than to walk about in a\ndesert spouting poetry Not that it mattered since there wasn\u2019t anybody to see or hear.",
    "There wasn\u2019t anybody \u2013 no she adjured herself no you must not give way to panic.",
    "This is all silliness sheer nerves \u2026\nShe turned quickly and began to walk back towards the rest house.",
    "She found that she was forcing herself not to break into a run.",
    "There was nothing to be afraid of in being alone \u2013 nothing at all.",
    "Perhaps she was one\nof those people who suffered from \u2013 now what was the word Not claustrophobia that\nwas the terror of confined spaces \u2013 the thing that was the opposite of that.",
    "It began with an\nA.",
    "The fear of open spaces.",
    "The whole thing could be explained scientifically.",
    "But explaining it scientifically though reassuring didn\u2019t at the moment actually help.",
    "Easy to say to yourself that the whole thing was perfectly logical and reasonable but\nnot so easy to control the curious odds and ends of thoughts that popped in and out of your\nhead for all the world like lizards popping out of holes.",
    "Myrna Randolph she thought like a snake \u2013 these other things like lizards.",
    "Open spaces \u2013 and all her life she\u2019d lived in a box.",
    "Yes a box with toy children and\ntoy servants and a toy husband.",
    "No Joan what are you saying \u2013 how can you be so silly Your children are real\nenough.",
    "The children were real and so were Cook and Agnes and so was Rodney.",
    "Then\nperhaps thought Joan I\u2019m not real.",
    "Perhaps I\u2019m just a toy wife and mother.",
    "Oh dear this was dreadful.",
    "Quite incoherent she was getting.",
    "Perhaps if she said some\nmore poetry.",
    "She must be able to remember something.",
    "And aloud with disproportionate fervour she exclaimed\n\u2018From you have I been absent in the Spring.\u2019\nShe couldn\u2019t remember how it went on.",
    "She didn\u2019t seem to want to.",
    "That line was\nenough in itself.",
    "It explained everything didn\u2019t it Rodney she thought Rodney \u2026 From\nyou have I been absent in the Spring.",
    "Only she thought it\u2019s not spring it\u2019s November \u2026\nAnd with a sudden sense of shock \u2013 But that\u2019s what he said \u2013 that evening \u2026\n\n\fThere was a connection there a clue a clue to something that was waiting for her\nhiding behind the silence.",
    "Something from which she now realized she wanted to escape.",
    "But how could you escape with lizards popping out of holes all round\nSo many things one mustn\u2019t let oneself think of.",
    "Barbara and Baghdad and Blanche\nall Bs how very curious.",
    "And Rodney on the platform at Victoria.",
    "And Averil and Tony\nand Barbara all being so unkind to her.",
    "Really \u2013 Joan was exasperated with herself \u2013 why didn\u2019t she think of the pleasant\nthings So many delightful memories.",
    "So many \u2013 so very many \u2026\nHer wedding dress such a lovely oystershell satin \u2026 Averil in her bassinette all\ntrimmed with muslin and pink ribbons such a lovely fair baby and so well behaved.",
    "Averil\nhad always been a polite wellmannered child.",
    "\u2018You bring them up so beautifully Mrs\nScudamore.\u2019 Yes a satisfactory child Averil \u2013 in public at any rate.",
    "In private life given\nto interminable argument and with a disconcerting way of looking at you as though she\nwondered what you were really like.",
    "Not at all the sort of way a child ought to look at its\nmother.",
    "Not in any sense of the word a loving child.",
    "Tony too had always done her\ncredit in public though he was incurably inattentive and vague over things.",
    "Barbara was\nthe only difficult child in the family given to tantrums and storms of tears.",
    "Still on the whole they were three very charming nicemannered wellbroughtup\nchildren.",
    "A pity children had to grow up and start being difficult.",
    "But she wouldn\u2019t think of all that.",
    "Concentrate on them in their childhood.",
    "Averil at\ndancing class in her pretty pink silk frock.",
    "Barbara in that nice little knitted dress from\nLiberty\u2019s.",
    "Tony in those cheery patterned rompers that Nannie made so cleverly \u2013\nSomehow thought Joan surely she could think of something else except the clothes\nthe children wore Some charming affectionate things that they had said to her Some\ndelightful moments of intimacy\nConsidering the sacrifices one made and the way one did everything for one\u2019s\nchildren \u2013\nAnother lizard popping its head out of a hole.",
    "Averil inquiring politely and with that\nair of reasonableness that Joan had learned to dread\n\u2018What do you really do for us Mother You don\u2019t bathe us do you\u2019\n\u2018No \u2013\u2019\n\u2018And you don\u2019t give us our dinners or brush our hair.",
    "Nannie does all that.",
    "And she\nputs us to bed and gets us up.",
    "And you don\u2019t make our clothes \u2013 Nannie does that too.",
    "And she takes us for walks \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Yes dear.",
    "I employ Nannie to look after you.",
    "That is to say I pay her her wages.\u2019\n\u2018I thought Father paid her her wages.",
    "Doesn\u2019t Father pay for all the things we have\u2019\n\u2018In a way dear but it\u2019s all the same thing.\u2019\n\u2018But you don\u2019t have to go to the office every morning only Father.",
    "Why don\u2019t you\n\n\fhave to go to the office\u2019\n\u2018Because I look after the house.\u2019\n\u2018But don\u2019t Kate and Cook and \u2013\u2019\n\u2018That will do Averil.\u2019\nThere was one thing to be said for Averil she always subsided when told.",
    "She was\nnever rebellious nor defiant.",
    "And yet her submission was often more uncomfortable than\nrebellion would have been.",
    "Rodney had laughed once and said that with Averil the verdict was always Non\nProven.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think you ought to laugh Rodney.",
    "I don\u2019t think a child of Averil\u2019s age ought to\nbe so \u2013 so critical.\u2019\n\u2018You think she\u2019s too young to determine the nature of evidence\u2019\n\u2018Oh don\u2019t be so legal.\u2019\nHe said with his teasing smile \u2018Who made me into a lawyer\u2019\n\u2018No but seriously I think it\u2019s disrespectful.\u2019\n\u2018I call Averil unusually polite for a child.",
    "There\u2019s none of the usual devastating\nfrankness children can employ \u2013 not like Babs.\u2019\nIt was true Joan admitted.",
    "Barbara in one of her states would shout out \u2018You\u2019re ugly\n\u2013 you\u2019re horrible \u2013 I hate you.",
    "I wish I was dead.",
    "You\u2019d be sorry if I was dead.\u2019\nJoan said quickly \u2018With Babs it\u2019s just temper.",
    "And she\u2019s always sorry afterwards.\u2019\n\u2018Yes poor little devil.",
    "And she doesn\u2019t mean what she says.",
    "But Averil has got quite a\nflair for detecting humbug.\u2019\nJoan flushed angrily.",
    "\u2018Humbug I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u2019\n\u2018Oh come now Joan.",
    "The stuff we feed them up with.",
    "Our assumption of\nomniscience.",
    "The necessity we are under of pretending to do what is best to know what is\nbest for those helpless little creatures who are so absolutely in our power.\u2019\n\u2018You talk as though they were slaves not children.\u2019\n\u2018Aren\u2019t they slaves They eat the food we give them and wear the clothes we put on\nthem and say more or less what we tell them to say.",
    "It\u2019s the price they pay for protection.",
    "But every day they live they are growing nearer to freedom.\u2019\n\u2018Freedom\u2019 Joan said scornfully.",
    "\u2018Is there any such thing\u2019\nRodney said slowly and heavily \u2018No I don\u2019t think there is.",
    "How right you are\nJoan \u2026\u2019\nAnd he had gone slowly out of the room his shoulders sagging a little.",
    "And she had\nthought with a sudden pang I know what Rodney will look like when he is old \u2026\nRodney on Victoria platform \u2013 the light showing up the lines in his tired face \u2013 telling\nher to take care of herself.",
    "And then a minute later \u2026\nWhy must she eternally come back to that It wasn\u2019t true Rodney was missing her a\ngreat deal It was miserable for him in the house alone with the servants And he probably\nnever thought of asking people in for dinner \u2013 or only somebody stupid like Hargrave\nTaylor \u2013 such a dull man she never could think why Rodney liked him.",
    "Or that tiresome\nMajor Mills who never talked of anything but pasture and cattle breeding \u2026\nOf course Rodney was missing her\n\n\fChapter Six\nShe arrived back at the rest house and the Indian came out and asked\n\u2018Memsahib have nice walk\u2019\nYes Joan said she had had a very nice walk.",
    "\u2018Dinner ready soon.",
    "Very nice dinner Memsahib.\u2019\nJoan said she was glad of that but the remark was clearly a ritual one for dinner was\nexactly the same as usual with peaches instead of apricots.",
    "It might be a nice dinner but\nits disadvantage was that it was always the same dinner.",
    "It was far too early to go to bed when dinner was over and once again Joan wished\nfervently that she had brought either a large supply of literature or some sewing with her.",
    "She even attempted to reread the more entertaining passages of Lady Catherine Dysart\u2019s\nMemoirs but the attempt was a failure.",
    "If there were anything to do Joan thought anything at all A pack of cards even.",
    "She\ncould have played patience.",
    "Or a game \u2013 backgammon chess draughts \u2013 she could have\nplayed against herself Any game \u2013 halma snakes and ladders \u2026\nReally a very curious fancy she had had out there.",
    "Lizards popping their heads out of\nholes.",
    "Thoughts popping up out of your mind \u2026 frightening thoughts disturbing thoughts\n\u2026 thoughts that one didn\u2019t want to have.",
    "But if so why have them After all one could control one\u2019s thoughts \u2013 or couldn\u2019t\none Was it possible that in some circumstances one\u2019s thoughts controlled oneself \u2026\npopping up out of holes like lizards \u2013 or flashing across one\u2019s mind like a green snake.",
    "Coming from somewhere \u2026\nVery odd that feeling of panic she had had.",
    "It must be agoraphobia.",
    "Of course that was the word \u2013 agoraphobia.",
    "It showed that\none could always remember things if one only thought hard enough.",
    "Yes that was it.",
    "The\nterror of open spaces.",
    "Curious that she had never known before that she suffered from it.",
    "But of course she had never before had any experience of open spaces.",
    "She had always\nlived in the midst of houses and gardens with plenty to do and plenty of people.",
    "Plenty of\npeople that was the thing.",
    "If only there was someone here to talk to.",
    "Even Blanche \u2026\nFunny to think how she had been appalled by the possibility that Blanche might be\nmaking the journey home with her.",
    "Why it would have made all the difference in the world to have had Blanche here.",
    "They could have talked over the old days at St Anne\u2019s.",
    "How very long ago that seemed.",
    "What was it Blanche had said You\u2019ve gone up in the world and I\u2019ve gone down.\u2019 No she\nhad qualified it afterwards \u2013 she had said \u2018You\u2019ve stayed where you were \u2013 a St Anne\u2019s\n\n\fgirl who\u2019s been a credit to the school.\u2019\nWas there really so little difference in her since those days Nice to think so.",
    "Well nice\nin a way but in another way not so nice.",
    "It seemed rather \u2013 rather stagnant somehow.",
    "What was it Miss Gilbey had said on the occasion of the leavetaking talk Miss\nGilbey\u2019s leavetaking talks to her girls were famous a recognized institution of St Anne\u2019s.",
    "Joan\u2019s mind swept back over the years and the figure of her old headmistress loomed\nimmediately into her field of vision with startling clarity.",
    "The large aggressive nose the\npincenez the mercilessly sharp eyes with their compelling gaze the terrific majesty of\nher progress through the school slightly preceded by her bust \u2013 a restrained disciplined\nbust that had about it only majesty and no suggestion of softness.",
    "A terrific figure Miss Gilbey justly feared and admired and who could produce just as\nfrightening an effect on parents as on pupils.",
    "No denying it Miss Gilbey was St Anne\u2019s\nJoan saw herself entering that sacred room with its flowers its Medici prints its\nimplications of culture scholarship and social graces.",
    "Miss Gilbey turning majestically from her desk \u2013\n\u2018Come in Joan.",
    "Sit down dear child.\u2019\nJoan had sat down as indicated in the cretonnecovered armchair.",
    "Miss Gilbey had\nremoved her pincenez had produced suddenly an unreal and distinctly terrifying smile.",
    "\u2018You are leaving us Joan to go from the circumscribed world of school into the larger\nworld which is life.",
    "I should like to have a little talk with you before you go in the hope\nthat some words of mine may be a guide to you in the days that are to come.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Miss Gilbey.\u2019\n\u2018Here in these happy surroundings with young companions of your own age you\nhave been shielded from the perplexities and difficulties which no one can entirely avoid\nin this life.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Miss Gilbey.\u2019\n\u2018You have I know been happy here.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Miss Gilbey.\u2019\n\u2018And you have done well here.",
    "I am pleased with the progress you have made.",
    "You\nhave been one of our most satisfactory pupils.\u2019\nSlight confusion \u2013 \u2018Oh \u2013 er \u2013 I\u2019m glad Miss Gilbey.\u2019\n\u2018But life opens out before you now with fresh problems fresh responsibilities \u2013\u2019\nThe talk flowed on.",
    "At the proper intervals Joan murmured\n\u2018Yes Miss Gilbey.\u2019\nShe felt slightly hypnotized.",
    "It was one of Miss Gilbey\u2019s assets in her career to possess a voice that was according\nto Blanche Haggard orchestral in its compass.",
    "Starting with the mellowness of a cello\n\n\fadministering praise in the accents of a flute deepening to warning in the tones of a\nbassoon.",
    "Then to those girls of marked intellectual prowess the exhortation to a career was\nproclaimed in terms of brass \u2013 to those of more domestic calibre the duties of wifehood\nand motherhood were mentioned in the muted notes of the violin.",
    "Not until the end of the discourse did Miss Gilbey as it were speak pizzicato.",
    "\u2018And now just a special word.",
    "No lazy thinking Joan my dear Don\u2019t just accept\nthings at their face value \u2013 because it\u2019s the easiest way and because it may save you pain\nLife is meant to be lived not glossed over.",
    "And don\u2019t be too pleased with yourself\u2019\n\u2018Yes \u2013 no Miss Gilbey.\u2019\n\u2018Because just entre nous that is a little your failing isn\u2019t it Joan Think of others my\ndear and not too much of yourself.",
    "And be prepared to accept responsibility.\u2019\nAnd then on to the grand orchestral climax\n\u2018Life Joan must be a continual progress \u2013 a rising on the stepping stones of our dead\nselves to higher things.",
    "Pain and suffering will come.",
    "They come to all.",
    "Even Our Lord\nwas not immune from the sufferings of our mortal life.",
    "As he knew the agony of\nGethsemane so you will know it \u2013 and if you do not know that Joan then it will mean\nthat your path has veered far from the true way.",
    "Remember this when the hour of doubt\nand travail comes.",
    "And remember my dear that I am glad to hear from my old girls at any\ntime \u2013 and always ready to help them with advice if they should ask for it.",
    "God bless you\ndear.\u2019\nAnd thereupon the final benediction of Miss Gilbey\u2019s parting kiss a kiss that was less\na human contact than a glorified accolade.",
    "Joan slightly dazed was dismissed.",
    "She returned to her dormitory to find Blanche Haggard wearing Mary Grant\u2019s pincenez and with a pillow stuffed down the front of her gym tunic giving an orchestral recital\nto an enraptured audience\n\u2018You are going\u2019 boomed Blanche \u2018from this happy world of school into the larger\nmore perilous world of life.",
    "Life opens out before you with its problems its\nresponsibilities \u2026\u2019\nJoan joined the audience.",
    "The applause grew as Blanche worked up to her climax.",
    "\u2018To you Blanche Haggard I say but one word.",
    "Discipline.",
    "Discipline your emotions\npractise selfcontrol.",
    "Your very warmth of heart may prove perilous.",
    "Only by strict\ndiscipline can you attain the heights.",
    "You have great gifts my dear.",
    "Use them well.",
    "You\nhave a lot of faults Blanche \u2013 a lot of faults.",
    "But they are the faults of a generous nature\nand they can be corrected.",
    "\u2018Life \u2013\u2019 Blanche\u2019s voice rose to a shrill falsetto \u2018is a continual progress.",
    "Rise on the\nstepping stones of our dead selves \u2013 see Wordsworth.",
    "Remember the old school and\nremember that Aunt Gilbey gives advice and help at any time if a stamped addressed\nenvelope is enclosed\u2019\nBlanche paused but to her surprise neither laughter nor applause greeted the pause.",
    "Everyone looked as though turned into marble and all heads were turned to the open\ndoorway where Miss Gilbey stood majestically pincenez in hand.",
    "\u2018If you are thinking of taking up a stage career Blanche I believe there are several\nexcellent schools of dramatic art where they would teach you proper voice control and\nelocution.",
    "You seem to have some talents in that direction.",
    "Kindly return that pillow to its\nproper place at once.\u2019\nAnd with that she moved swiftly away.",
    "\u2018Whew\u2019 said Blanche.",
    "\u2018The old tartar Pretty sporting of her \u2013 but she does know how\nto make you feel small.\u2019\nYes thought Joan Miss Gilbey had been a great personality.",
    "She had finally retired\nfrom St Anne\u2019s just a term after Averil had been sent there.",
    "The new headmistress had\nlacked her dynamic personality and the school had started to go down in consequence.",
    "Blanche had been right Miss Gilbey had been a tartar.",
    "But she had known how to\nmake herself felt.",
    "And she had certainly Joan reflected been quite right about Blanche.",
    "Discipline \u2013 that was what Blanche had needed in her life.",
    "Generous instincts \u2013 yes\npossibly.",
    "But selfcontrol had been notably lacking.",
    "Still Blanche was generous.",
    "That\nmoney for instance the money that Joan had sent her \u2013 Blanche hadn\u2019t spent it on herself.",
    "It had bought a rolltop desk for Tom Holliday.",
    "A rolltop desk was the last thing in the\nworld that Blanche would have wanted.",
    "A warmhearted kindly creature Blanche.",
    "And yet\nshe had left her children gone off callously and deserted the two little creatures she herself\nhad brought into the world.",
    "It just showed that there were people who had simply no maternal instinct whatsoever.",
    "One\u2019s children thought Joan should always come first.",
    "She and Rodney had always\nagreed on that.",
    "Rodney was really very unselfish \u2013 if it was put to him that is in the right\nway.",
    "She had pointed out to him for instance that that nice sunny dressingroom of his\nreally ought to be the children\u2019s day nursery and he had agreed quite willingly to move\ninto the little room overlooking the stable yard.",
    "Children should have all the sun and light\nthere was.",
    "She and Rodney had really been very conscientious parents.",
    "And the children had\nreally been very satisfactory especially when they were quite small \u2013 such attractive\nhandsome children.",
    "Much better brought up than the Sherston boys for instance.",
    "Mrs\nSherston never seemed to mind what those children looked like.",
    "And she herself seemed\nto join them in the most curious activities crawling along the ground as a Red Indian \u2013\nuttering wild whoops and yells \u2013 and once when they were attempting a reproduction of a\ncircus giving a most lifelike imitation of a sea lion\nThe fact was Joan decided that Leslie Sherston herself had never properly grown up.",
    "Still she\u2019d had a very sad life poor woman.",
    "Joan thought of the time when she had so unexpectedly run across Captain Sherston in\nSomerset.",
    "She had been staying with friends in that part of the world and had had no idea the\nSherstons were living there.",
    "She had come face to face with Captain Sherston as he\n\n\femerged so typical from the local pub.",
    "She had not seen him since his release and it was really quite a shock to see the\ndifference from the old days of the jaunty confident bank manager.",
    "That curiously deflated look that big aggressive men got when they had failed in the\nworld.",
    "The sagging shoulders the loose waistcoat the flabby cheeks the quick shifty look\nof the eyes.",
    "To think that anyone could ever have trusted this man.",
    "He was taken aback by meeting her but he rallied well and greeted her with what was\na painful travesty of his old manner\n\u2018Well well well Mrs Scudamore The world is indeed a small place.",
    "And what brings\nyou to Skipton Haynes\u2019\nStanding there squaring his shoulders endeavouring to put into his voice the old\nheartiness and self assurance.",
    "It was a pitiful performance and Joan had in spite of herself\nfelt quite sorry for him.",
    "How dreadful to come down in the world like that To feel that at any moment you\nmight come across someone from the old life someone who might refuse even to\nrecognize you.",
    "Not that she had any intention herself of behaving that way.",
    "Naturally she was quite\nprepared to be kind.",
    "Sherston was saying \u2018You must come back and see my wife.",
    "You must have tea with\nus.",
    "Yes yes dear lady I insist\u2019\nAnd the parody of his old manner was so painful that Joan albeit rather unwillingly\nallowed herself to be piloted along the street Sherston continuing to talk in his new\nuneasy way.",
    "He\u2019d like her to see their little place \u2013 at least not so little.",
    "Quite a good acreage.",
    "Hard\nwork of course growing for the market.",
    "Anemones and apples were their best line.",
    "Still talking he unlatched a somewhat dilapidated gate that needed painting and they\nwalked up a weedy drive.",
    "Then they saw Leslie her back bent over the anemone beds.",
    "\u2018Look who\u2019s here\u2019 Sherston called and Leslie had pushed her hair back from her face\nand had come over and said this was a surprise\nJoan had noticed at once how much older Leslie looked and how ill.",
    "There were lines\ncarved by fatigue and pain on her face.",
    "But otherwise she was exactly the same as usual\ncheerful and untidy and terrifically energetic.",
    "As they were standing there talking the boys arrived home from school charging up\nthe drive with loud howls and rushing at Leslie butting at her with their heads shouting\nout Mum Mum Mum and Leslie after enduring the onslaught for some minutes suddenly\nsaid in a very peremptory voice \u2018Quiet Visitors.\u2019\nAnd the boys had suddenly transformed themselves into two polite angels who shook\nhands with Mrs Scudamore and spoke in soft hushed voices.",
    "Joan was reminded a little of a cousin of hers who trained sporting dogs.",
    "On the word\nof command the dogs would sit dropping to their haunches or on another word dash\nwildly for the horizon.",
    "Leslie\u2019s children she thought seemed trained much on the same\nplan.",
    "They went into the house and Leslie went to get tea with the boys helping her and\npresently it came in on a tray with the loaf and the butter and the homemade jam and the\nthick kitchen cups and Leslie and the boys laughing.",
    "But the most curious thing that happened was the change in Sherston.",
    "That uneasy\nshifty painful manner of his vanished.",
    "He became suddenly the master of the house and\nthe host \u2013 and a very good host.",
    "Even his social manner was in abeyance.",
    "He looked\nsuddenly happy pleased with himself and with his family.",
    "It was as though within these\nfour walls the outer world and its judgment ceased to exist for him.",
    "The boys clamoured\nfor him to help them with some carpentry they were doing Leslie adjured him not to\nforget that he had promised to see to the hoe for her and ought they to bunch the anemones\ntomorrow or could they do it Thursday morning\nJoan thought to herself that she had never liked him better.",
    "She understood she felt\nfor the first time Leslie\u2019s devotion to him.",
    "Besides he must have been a very goodlooking\nman once.",
    "But a moment or two later she got rather a shock.",
    "Peter was crying eagerly \u2018Tell us the funny story about the warder and the plum\npudding\u2019\nAnd then urgently as his father looked blank\n\u2018You know when you were in prison what the warder said and the other warder\u2019\nSherston hesitated and looked slightly shamefaced.",
    "Leslie\u2019s voice said calmly\n\u2018Go on Charles.",
    "It\u2019s a very funny story.",
    "Mrs Scudamore would like to hear it.\u2019\nSo he had told it and it was quite funny \u2013 if not so funny as the boys seemed to think.",
    "They rolled about squirming and gasping with laughter.",
    "Joan laughed politely but she was\ndefinitely startled and a little shocked and later when Leslie had taken her upstairs she\nmurmured delicately\n\u2018I\u2019d no idea \u2013 they knew\u2019\nLeslie \u2013 really Joan thought Leslie Sherston must be most insensitive \u2013 looked rather\namused.",
    "\u2018They\u2019d be bound to know some day\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Wouldn\u2019t they So they might just as\nwell know now.",
    "It\u2019s simpler.\u2019\nIt was simpler Joan agreed but was it wise The delicate idealism of a child\u2019s mind\nto shatter its trust and faith \u2013 she broke off.",
    "Leslie said she didn\u2019t think her children were very delicate and idealistic.",
    "It would be\nworse for them she thought to know there was something \u2013 and not be told what it was.",
    "She waved her hands in that clumsy inarticulate way she had and said \u2018Making\n\n\fmysteries \u2013 all that \u2013 much worse.",
    "When they asked me why Daddy had gone away I\nthought I might just as well be natural about it so I told them that he\u2019d stolen money from\nthe bank and gone to prison.",
    "After all they know what stealing is.",
    "Peter used to steal jam\nand get sent to bed for it.",
    "If grownup people do things that are wrong they get sent to\nprison.",
    "It\u2019s quite simple.\u2019\n\u2018All the same for a child to look down on its father instead of up to him \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Oh they don\u2019t look down on him.\u2019 Leslie again seemed amused.",
    "\u2018They\u2019re actually\nquite sorry for him \u2013 and they love to hear all about the prison life.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not a good thing\u2019 said Joan decidedly.",
    "\u2018Oh don\u2019t you think so\u2019 Leslie meditated.",
    "\u2018Perhaps not.",
    "But it\u2019s been good for\nCharles.",
    "He came back simply cringing \u2013 like a dog.",
    "I couldn\u2019t bear it.",
    "So I thought the\nonly thing to do was to be quite natural about it.",
    "After all you can\u2019t pretend three years of\nyour life have never existed.",
    "It\u2019s better I think to treat it as just one of those things.\u2019\nAnd that thought Joan was Leslie Sherston casual slack and with no conception of\nany finer shades of feeling Always taking the way of least resistance.",
    "Still give her her due she had been a loyal wife.",
    "Joan had said kindly \u2018You know Leslie I really think you have been quite splendid\nthe way you have stuck to your husband and worked so hard to keep things going while he\nwas \u2013 er \u2013 away.",
    "Rodney and I often say so.\u2019\nWhat a funny onesided smile the woman had.",
    "Joan hadn\u2019t noticed it until this minute.",
    "Perhaps her praise had embarrassed Leslie.",
    "It was certainly in rather a stiff voice that\nLeslie asked\n\u2018How is \u2013 Rodney\u2019\n\u2018Very busy the poor lamb.",
    "I\u2019m always telling him he ought to take a day off now and\nagain.\u2019\nLeslie said \u2018That\u2019s not so easy.",
    "I suppose in his job \u2013 like mine \u2013 it\u2019s pretty well full\ntime.",
    "There aren\u2019t many possible days off.\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "I daresay that\u2019s true and of course Rodney is very conscientious.\u2019\n\u2018A fulltime job\u2019 Leslie said.",
    "She went slowly towards the window and stood there\nstaring out.",
    "Something about the outline of her figure struck Joan \u2013 Leslie usually wore things\npretty shapeless but surely \u2013\n\u2018Oh Leslie\u2019 Joan exclaimed impulsively.",
    "\u2018Surely you aren\u2019t \u2013\u2019\nLeslie turned and meeting the other woman\u2019s eyes slowly nodded her head.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018In August.\u2019\n\u2018Oh my dear.\u2019 Joan felt genuinely distressed.",
    "And suddenly surprisingly Leslie broke into passionate speech.",
    "She was no longer\ncasual and slack.",
    "She was like a condemned prisoner who puts up a defence.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s made all the difference to Charles.",
    "All the difference Do you see I can\u2019t tell you\nhow he feels about it.",
    "It\u2019s a kind of symbol \u2013 that he\u2019s not an outcast \u2013 that everything\u2019s\nthe same as it always was.",
    "He\u2019s even tried to stop drinking since he\u2019s known.\u2019\nSo impassioned was Leslie\u2019s voice that Joan hardly realized until afterwards the\nimplication of the last sentence.",
    "She said \u2018Of course you know your own business best but I should have thought it\nwas unwise \u2013 at the moment.\u2019\n\u2018Financially you mean\u2019 Leslie laughed.",
    "\u2018Oh we\u2019ll weather the storm.",
    "We grow pretty\nwell all we eat anyway.\u2019\n\u2018And you know you don\u2019t look very strong.\u2019\n\u2018Strong I\u2019m terribly strong.",
    "Too strong.",
    "Whatever kills me won\u2019t kill me easily I\u2019m\nafraid.\u2019\nAnd she had given a little shiver \u2013 as though \u2013 even then \u2013 she had had some strange\nprevision of disease and racking pain \u2026\nAnd then they had gone downstairs again and Sherston had said he would walk with\nMrs Scudamore to the corner and show her the short cut across the fields and turning her\nhead as they went down the drive she saw Leslie and the boys all tangled up and rolling\nover and over on the ground with shrieks of wild mirth.",
    "Leslie rolling about with her\nyoung quite like an animal thought Joan with slight disgust and then bent her head\nattentively to listen to what Captain Sherston was saying.",
    "He was saying in rather incoherent terms that there never was never had been never\nwould be any woman like his wife.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve no idea Mrs Scudamore what she\u2019s been to me.",
    "No idea.",
    "Nobody could.",
    "I\u2019m\nnot worthy of her.",
    "I know that \u2026\u2019\nJoan observed with alarm that the easy tears were standing in his eyes.",
    "He was a man\nwho could quickly become maudlin.",
    "\u2018Always the same \u2013 always cheerful \u2013 seems to think that everything that happens is\ninteresting and amusing.",
    "And never a word of reproach.",
    "Never a word.",
    "But I\u2019ll make it up\nto her \u2013 I swear I\u2019ll make it up to her.\u2019\nIt occurred to Joan that Captain Sherston could best show his appreciation by not\nvisiting the Anchor and Bell too frequently.",
    "She very nearly said so.",
    "She got away from him at last saying Of course of course and what he said was so\ntrue and it had been so nice to see them both.",
    "She went away across the fields and looking\nback as she crossed the stile she saw Captain Sherston at a standstill outside the Anchor\nand Bell looking at his watch to decide how long it was to opening time.",
    "The whole thing she said to Rodney when she got back was very sad.",
    "And Rodney seemingly purposefully dense had said \u2018I thought you said that they all\nseemed very happy together\u2019\n\u2018Well yes in a way.\u2019\n\n\fRodney said that it seemed to him as though Leslie Sherston was making quite a\nsuccess of a bad business.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s certainly being very plucky about it all.",
    "And just think \u2013 she\u2019s actually going to\nhave another child.\u2019\nRodney had got up on that and walked slowly across to the window.",
    "He had stood\nthere looking out \u2013 very much now she came to think of it as Leslie had stood.",
    "He said\nafter a minute or two \u2018When\u2019\n\u2018August\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I think it\u2019s extremely foolish of her.\u2019\n\u2018Do you\u2019\n\u2018My dear just consider.",
    "They\u2019re living hand to mouth as it is.",
    "A young baby will be an\nadded complication.\u2019\n\u2018He said slowly Leslie\u2019s shoulders are broad.\u2019\n\u2018Well she\u2019ll crack up if she tries to take on too much.",
    "She looks ill now.\u2019\n\u2018She looked ill when she left here.\u2019\n\u2018She looks years older too.",
    "It\u2019s all very well to say that this will make all the\ndifference to Charles Sherston.\u2019\n\u2018Is that what she said\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "She said it had made all the difference.\u2019\nRodney said thoughtfully \u2018That\u2019s probably true.",
    "Sherston is one of those extraordinary\npeople who live entirely on the esteem in which other people hold them.",
    "When the judge\npassed sentence on him he collapsed just like a pricked balloon.",
    "It was quite pitiful and at\nthe same time quite disgusting.",
    "I should say the only hope for Sherston is to get back\nsomehow or other his self respect.",
    "It will be a fulltime job.\u2019\n\u2018Still I really do think that another child \u2013\u2019\nRodney interrupted her.",
    "He turned from the window and the white anger of his face\nstartled her.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s his wife isn\u2019t she She\u2019d only got two courses open to her \u2013 to cut loose\nentirely and take the kids \u2013 or to go back and damn well be a wife to him.",
    "That\u2019s what\nshe\u2019s done \u2013 and Leslie doesn\u2019t do things by halves.\u2019\nAnd Joan had asked if there was anything to get excited about and Rodney replied\n\u2018Certainly not\u2019 but he was sick and tired of a prudent careful world that counted the cost\nof everything before doing it and never took a risk Joan said she hoped he didn\u2019t talk like\nthat to his clients and Rodney grinned and said No fear he always advised them to settle\nout of court\n\n\fChapter Seven\nIt was perhaps natural that Joan should dream that night of Miss Gilbey.",
    "Miss Gilbey in a\nsolar topee walking beside her in the desert and saying in an authoritative voice \u2018You\nshould have paid more attention to lizards Joan.",
    "Your natural history is weak.\u2019 To which\nof course she had replied \u2018Yes Miss Gilbey.\u2019\nAnd Miss Gilbey had said \u2018Now don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know what I mean Joan.",
    "You know perfectly well.",
    "Discipline my dear.\u2019\nJoan woke up and for a moment or two thought herself back at St Anne\u2019s.",
    "It was true\nthe rest house was not unlike a school dormitory.",
    "The bareness the iron beds the rather\nhygieniclooking walls.",
    "Oh dear thought Joan another day to get through.",
    "What was it Miss Gilbey had said in her dream \u2018Discipline.\u2019\nWell there was something in that.",
    "It had really been very foolish of her the day before\nto get into that queer state all about nothing She must discipline her thoughts arrange her\nmind systematically \u2013 investigate once and for all this agoraphobia idea.",
    "Certainly she felt quite all right now here in the rest house.",
    "Perhaps it would be wiser\nnot to go out at all\nBut her heart sank at the prospect.",
    "All day in the gloom with the smell of mutton fat\nand paraffin and Flit \u2013 all day with nothing to read \u2013 nothing to do.",
    "What did prisoners do in their cells Well of course they had exercise and they sewed\nmail bags or something like that.",
    "Otherwise she supposed they would go mad.",
    "But there was solitary confinement \u2026 that did send people mad.",
    "Solitary confinement \u2013 day after day \u2013 week after week.",
    "Why she felt as though she had been here for weeks And it was \u2013 how long \u2013 two\ndays\nTwo days Incredible.",
    "What was that line of Omar Khayyam\u2019s \u2018Myself with\nYesterday\u2019s Ten Thousand Years.\u2019 Something like that.",
    "Why couldn\u2019t she remember\nanything properly\nNo no not again.",
    "Trying to remember and recite poetry hadn\u2019t been a success \u2013 not at\nall a success.",
    "The truth is there was something very upsetting about poetry.",
    "It had a\npoignancy \u2013 a way of striking through to the spirit \u2026\nWhat was she talking about Surely the more spiritual one\u2019s thoughts were the better.",
    "And she had always been a rather spiritual type of person \u2026\n\u2018You always were as cold as a fish \u2026\u2019\nWhy should Blanche\u2019s voice come cutting through to her thoughts A very vulgar and\n\n\funcalled for remark \u2013 really just like Blanche Well she supposed that that was what it\nmust seem like to someone like Blanche someone who allowed themselves to be torn to\npieces by their passions.",
    "You couldn\u2019t really blame Blanche for being coarse \u2013 she was\nsimply made that way.",
    "It hadn\u2019t been noticeable as a girl because she had been so lovely\nand so well bred but the coarseness must always have been there underneath.",
    "Cold as a fish indeed Nothing of the kind.",
    "It would have been a good deal better for Blanche if she had been a little more fishlike\nin temperament herself\nShe seemed to have led the most deplorable life.",
    "Really quite deplorable.",
    "What had she said \u2018One can always think of one\u2019s sins\u2019\nPoor Blanche But she had admitted that that wouldn\u2019t give Joan occupation long.",
    "She\ndid realize then the difference between herself and Joan.",
    "She had pretended to think that\nJoan would soon get tired of counting her blessings.",
    "True perhaps that one did tend to\ntake one\u2019s blessings for granted What was it she had said after that Something rather\ncurious \u2026\nOh yes.",
    "She had wondered what if you had nothing to do but think about yourself for\ndays and days you might find out about yourself \u2026\nIn a way rather an interesting idea.",
    "In fact quite an interesting idea.",
    "Only Blanche had said that she herself wouldn\u2019t like to try it \u2026\nShe had sounded \u2013 almost \u2013 afraid.",
    "I wonder thought Joan if one would make any discoveries about oneself.",
    "Of course I\u2019m not used to thinking of myself \u2026\nI\u2019ve never been a selfcentred sort of woman.",
    "\u2026 I wonder thought Joan how I appear to other people\n\u2026 I don\u2019t mean in general \u2013 I mean in particular.",
    "She tried to remember any instances of things people had said to her \u2026\nBarbara for instance\n\u2018Oh your servants Mother are always perfection.",
    "You see to that.\u2019\nQuite a tribute in a way showing that her children did consider her a good manager\nand housewife.",
    "And it was true she did run her house well and efficiently.",
    "And her\nservants liked her \u2013 at least they did what she told them.",
    "They weren\u2019t perhaps very\nsympathetic if she had a headache or wasn\u2019t feeling well but then she hadn\u2019t encouraged\nthem on those lines.",
    "And what was it that that very excellent cook had said when she had\ngiven her notice something about not being able to go on for ever without any\nappreciation \u2013 something quite ridiculous.",
    "\u2018Always being told when a thing\u2019s wrong Ma\u2019am and never a word of praise when\nit\u2019s right \u2013 well it takes the heart out of you.\u2019\nShe had answered coldly \u2018Surely you realize Cook that if nothing is said it is because\neverything is all right and perfectly satisfactory.\u2019\n\u2018That may be Ma\u2019am but it\u2019s disheartening.",
    "After all I\u2019m a human being \u2013 and I did\ntake a lot of trouble over that Spanish Ragout you asked for though it was a lot of trouble\nand I\u2019m not one that cares for madeup dishes myself.\u2019\n\u2018It was quite excellent Cook.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Ma\u2019am.",
    "I thought it must have been as you finished it all in the diningroom but\nnothing was said.\u2019\nJoan said impatiently \u2018Don\u2019t you think you are being rather silly After all you are\nengaged to do the cooking at a very good salary \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Oh the wages are quite satisfactory Ma\u2019am.\u2019\n\u2018\u2013 and therefore the understanding is that you are a sufficiently good cook.",
    "If anything\nis not satisfactory I mention it.\u2019\n\u2018You do indeed Ma\u2019am.\u2019\n\u2018And apparently you resent the fact\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not that Ma\u2019am but I think we\u2019d best say no more about it and I\u2019ll leave at the\nend of my month.\u2019\nServants thought Joan were very unsatisfactory.",
    "So full of feelings and resentments.",
    "They all adored Rodney of course simply because he was a man.",
    "Nothing was ever too\nmuch trouble to do for the Master.",
    "And Rodney would sometimes come out with the most\nunexpected knowledge concerning them.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t pitch into Edna\u2019 he would say surprisingly.",
    "\u2018Her young man\u2019s taken up with\nanother girl and it\u2019s thrown her right out of gear.",
    "That\u2019s why she\u2019s dropping things and\nhanding the vegetables twice and forgetting everything.\u2019\n\u2018How on earth do you know Rodney\u2019\n\u2018She told me this morning.\u2019\n\u2018Very extraordinary that she should talk to you about it.\u2019\n\u2018Well I asked her what was wrong as a matter of fact.",
    "I noticed her eyes were red as\nthough she had been crying.\u2019\nRodney thought Joan was an unusually kind person.",
    "She had said to him once \u2018I should think that with your experience as a lawyer you\nwould get tired of human tangles.\u2019\nAnd he had answered thoughtfully \u2018Yes one might think so.",
    "But it doesn\u2019t work that\nway.",
    "I suppose a country family solicitor sees more of the seamy side of human\nrelationships than almost anybody else except a doctor.",
    "But it only seems to deepen one\u2019s\npity for the whole human race \u2013 so vulnerable so prone to fear and suspicion and greed \u2013\n\n\fand sometimes so unexpectedly unselfish and brave.",
    "That is perhaps the only\ncompensation there is \u2013 the widening of one\u2019s sympathies.\u2019\nIt had been on the tip of her tongue to say\u2018Compensation What do you mean\u2019 But\nfor some reason she hadn\u2019t said it.",
    "Better not she thought.",
    "No better to say nothing.",
    "But she had been disturbed sometimes by the practical expression of Rodney\u2019s easily\nawakened sympathies.",
    "The question for instance of old Hoddesdon\u2019s mortgage.",
    "She had learned about that not from Rodney but from the garrulous wife of\nHoddesdon\u2019s nephew and she had come home seriously perturbed.",
    "Was it true that Rodney had advanced the money out of his private capital\nRodney had looked vexed.",
    "He had flushed and answered heatedly\n\u2018Who\u2019s been talking\u2019\nShe told him and then said \u2018Why couldn\u2019t he borrow the money in the ordinary way\u2019\n\u2018Security isn\u2019t good enough from the strictly business point of view.",
    "It\u2019s difficult to\nraise mortgages on farmland just now.\u2019\n\u2018Then why on earth are you lending it\u2019\n\u2018Oh I shall be all right.",
    "Hoddesdon\u2019s a good farmer really.",
    "It\u2019s lack of capital and two\nbad seasons that have let him down.\u2019\n\u2018The fact remains that he\u2019s in a bad way and has to raise money.",
    "I really can\u2019t feel that\nthis is good business Rodney.\u2019\nAnd quite suddenly and unexpectedly Rodney had lost his temper.",
    "Did she understand the first thing he had asked her about the plight that farmers all\nover the country were in Did she realize the difficulties the obstacles the shortsighted\npolicy of the Government He had stood there pouring out a welter of information\nconcerning the whole agricultural position of England passing from that to a warm\nindignant description of old Hoddesdon\u2019s particular difficulties.",
    "\u2018It might happen to anyone.",
    "No matter how intelligent and hardworking he was.",
    "It\nmight have happened to me if I\u2019d been in his position.",
    "It\u2019s lack of capital to begin with and\nbad luck following on.",
    "And anyway if you don\u2019t mind my saying so it isn\u2019t your\nbusiness Joan.",
    "I don\u2019t interfere with your management of the house and the children.",
    "That\u2019s your department.",
    "This is mine.\u2019\nShe had been hurt \u2013 quite bitterly hurt.",
    "To take such a tone was most unlike Rodney.",
    "It\nwas really the nearest they had come to having a quarrel.",
    "And all over that tiresome old Hoddesdon.",
    "Rodney was besotted about the stupid old\nman.",
    "On Sunday afternoons he would go out there and spend the afternoon walking round\nwith Hoddesdon and come back full of information about the state of the crops and cattle\ndiseases and other totally uninteresting subjects of conversation.",
    "He even used to victimize their guests with the same kind of talk.",
    "Why Joan remembered how at a garden party she had noticed Rodney and Mrs\nSherston sitting together on one of the garden seats with Rodney talking talking talking.",
    "So much so that she had wondered what on earth he had been talking about and had gone\nup to them.",
    "Because really he seemed so excited and Leslie Sherston was listening with\nsuch apparently tense interest.",
    "And apparently all he was talking about were dairy herds and the necessity of keeping\nup the level of pedigree stock in this country.",
    "Hardly a subject that could be of any interest to Leslie Sherston who had no particular\nknowledge of or interest in such matters.",
    "Yet she had been listening with apparently deep\nattention her eyes on Rodney\u2019s eager animated face.",
    "\u2018Joan had said lightly Really Rodney you mustn\u2019t bore poor Mrs Sherston with such\ndull things.\u2019 For that had been where the Sherstons first came to Crayminster and before\nthey knew them very well.",
    "The light had died out of Rodney\u2019s face and he had said apologetically to Leslie\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\nAnd Leslie Sherston had said quickly and abruptly in the way she always spoke\n\u2018You\u2019re wrong Mrs Scudamore.",
    "I found what Mr Scudamore was saying very\ninteresting.\u2019\nAnd there had been a gleam in her eye which had made Joan say to herself \u2018Really I\nbelieve that woman has got quite a temper \u2026\u2019\nAnd the next thing that had happened was that Myrna Randolph had come up just a\nlittle out of breath and had exclaimed\n\u2018Rodney darling you must come and play in this set with me.",
    "We\u2019re waiting for you.\u2019\nAnd with that charming imperious manner that only a really goodlooking girl can get\naway with she had stretched out both hands pulled Rodney to his feet and smiling up into\nhis face had simply swept him away to the tennis court.",
    "Whether Rodney had wanted to\nor not\nShe had walked beside him her arm familiarly slipped through his turning her head\ngazing up into his face.",
    "And Joan had thought angrily to herself It\u2019s all very well but men don\u2019t like girls who\nthrow themselves at their heads like that.",
    "And then had wondered with a sudden queer cold feeling whether perhaps men did\nlike it after all\nShe had looked up to find Leslie Sherston watching her.",
    "Leslie no longer looked as\nthough she had a temper.",
    "She looked instead as though she was rather sorry for her Joan.",
    "Which was impertinence if nothing else.",
    "Joan stirred restlessly in her narrow bed.",
    "How on earth had she got back to Myrna\nRandolph Oh of course wondering what effect she herself had on other people.",
    "Myrna\nshe supposed had disliked her.",
    "Well Myrna was welcome to do so.",
    "The kind of girl who\n\n\fwould break up anybody\u2019s married life if she got the chance\nWell well no need getting hot and bothered about that now.",
    "She must get up and have breakfast.",
    "Perhaps they could poach an egg for her as a\nchange She was so tired of leathery omelettes.",
    "The Indian however seemed impervious to the suggestion of a poached egg.",
    "\u2018Cook egg in water You mean boil\u2019\nNo Joan said she didn\u2019t mean boil.",
    "A boiled egg in the rest house as she knew by\nexperience was always hard boiled.",
    "She tried to explain the science of the poached egg.",
    "The Indian shook his head.",
    "\u2018Put egg in water \u2013 egg all go away.",
    "I give Memsahib nice fried egg.\u2019\nSo Joan had two nice fried eggs well frizzled outside and with hard firm pale yolks.",
    "On the whole she thought she preferred the omelette.",
    "Breakfast was over all too soon.",
    "She inquired for news of the train but there was no\nnews.",
    "So there she was fairly and squarely up against it.",
    "Another long day ahead of her.",
    "But today at any rate she would plan her time out intelligently.",
    "The trouble was that\nup to now she had just tried to pass the time.",
    "She had been a person waiting at a railway station for a train and naturally that\nengendered in one a nervy jumpy frame of mind.",
    "Supposing she were to consider this as a period of rest and \u2013 yes discipline.",
    "Something in the nature of a Retreat.",
    "That is what Roman Catholics called it.",
    "They went\nfor Retreats and came back spiritually refreshed.",
    "There is no reason thought Joan why I should not be spiritually refreshed too.",
    "Her life had been perhaps too slack lately.",
    "Too pleasant too easy going.",
    "A wraithlike Miss Gilbey seemed to be standing at her side and saying in the wellremembered bassoonlike accents \u2018Discipline\u2019\nOnly actually that was what she had said to Blanche Haggard.",
    "To Joan she had said\nreally rather unkindly \u2018Don\u2019t be too pleased with yourself Joan.\u2019\nIt was unkind.",
    "For Joan never had been in the least bit pleased with herself \u2013 not in\nthat fatuous sort of way.",
    "\u2018Think of others my dear and not too much of yourself.\u2019 Well\nthat is what she had done \u2013 always thought of others.",
    "She hardly ever thought of herself \u2013\nor put herself first.",
    "She had always been unselfish \u2013 thinking of the children \u2013 of Rodney.",
    "Averil\nWhy did she have suddenly to think of Averil\nWhy see so clearly her elder daughter\u2019s face \u2013 with its polite slightly scornful smile.",
    "Averil there was no doubt of it had never appreciated her mother properly.",
    "The things she said sometimes quite sarcastic things were really most irritating.",
    "Not\n\n\fexactly rude but \u2013\nWell but what\nThat look of quiet amusement those raised eyebrows.",
    "The way Averil would stroll\ngently out of a room.",
    "Averil was devoted to her of course all her children were devoted to her \u2013\nWere they\nWere her children devoted to her \u2013 did they really care for her at all\nJoan half rose out of her chair then sank back.",
    "Where did these ideas come from What made her think them Such frightening\nunpleasant ideas.",
    "Put them out of her head \u2013 try not to think of them \u2026\nMiss Gilbey\u2019s voice \u2013 pizzicato \u2013\n\u2018No lazy thinking Joan.",
    "Don\u2019t accept things at their face value because that\u2019s the\neasiest way and because it may save you pain \u2026\u2019\nWas that why she wanted to force these ideas back To save herself pain\nBecause they certainly were painful ideas \u2026\nAveril \u2026\nWas Averil devoted to her Was Averil \u2013 come now Joan face it \u2013 was Averil even\nfond of her\nWell the truth was that Averil was rather a peculiar kind of girl \u2013 cool unemotional.",
    "No not perhaps unemotional.",
    "Actually Averil had been the only one of the three\nchildren to give them real trouble.",
    "Cool wellbehaved quiet Averil.",
    "The shock it had given them\nThe shock it had given her\nShe had opened the letter without the least suspicion of its contents.",
    "Addressed in a\nscrawled illiterate hand she had taken it to be from one of her many charitable\npensioners.",
    "She had read the words almost uncomprehendingly.",
    "\u2018This is to let you know as how your eldest daughter is carrying on with the Dr up at\nthe Saniturum.",
    "Kissing in the woods something shameful it is and ought to be stopped.\u2019\nJoan stared at the dirty sheet of paper with a definite feeling of nausea.",
    "What an abominable \u2013 what a disgusting \u2013 thing \u2013\nShe had heard of anonymous letters.",
    "She had never received one before.",
    "Really it\nmade one feel quite sick.",
    "Your eldest daughter \u2013 Averil Averil of all people in the world Carrying on\ndisgusting phrase with the Dr up at the Saniturum.",
    "Dr Cargill That eminent\ndistinguished specialist who had made such a success of his tubercular treatment a man at\n\n\fleast twenty years older than Averil a man with a charming invalid wife.",
    "What rubbish What disgusting rubbish.",
    "And at that moment Averil herself had walked into the room and had asked but with\nonly mild curiosity for Averil was never really curious \u2018Is anything the matter Mother\u2019\nJoan the hand that held the letter shaking had hardly been able to reply.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think I had better even show it to you Averil.",
    "It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s too disgusting.\u2019\nHer voice had trembled.",
    "Averil raising those cool delicate eyebrows of hers in\nsurprise said \u2018Something in a letter\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018About me\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019d better not even see it dear.\u2019\nBut Averil walking across the room had quietly taken the letter out of her hand.",
    "Had stood there a minute reading it then had handed it back and had said in a\nreflective detached voice \u2018Yes not very nice.\u2019\n\u2018Nice It\u2019s disgusting \u2013 quite disgusting.",
    "People should be punished by law for telling\nsuch lies.\u2019\nAveril said quietly \u2018It\u2019s a foul letter but it\u2019s not a lie.\u2019\nThe room had turned a somersault and revolved round and round.",
    "Joan had gasped out\n\u2018What do you mean \u2013 what can you mean\u2019\n\u2018You needn\u2019t make such a fuss Mother.",
    "I\u2019m sorry this has come to you this way but I\nsuppose you would have been bound to know sooner or later.\u2019\n\u2018You mean it\u2019s true That you and \u2013 and Dr Cargill \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019 Averil had just nodded her head.",
    "\u2018But it\u2019s wicked \u2013 it\u2019s disgraceful.",
    "A man of that age a married man \u2013 and a young girl\nlike you \u2013\u2019\nAveril said impatiently \u2018You needn\u2019t make a kind of village melodrama out of it.",
    "It\u2019s\nnot in the least like that.",
    "It\u2019s all happened very gradually.",
    "Rupert\u2019s wife is an invalid \u2013 has\nbeen for years.",
    "We\u2019ve \u2013 well we\u2019ve simply come to care for each other.",
    "That\u2019s all.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s all indeed\u2019 Joan had plenty to say and said it.",
    "Averil merely shrugged her\nshoulders and let the storm play round her.",
    "In the end when Joan had exhausted herself\nAveril remarked\n\u2018I can quite appreciate your point of view Mother.",
    "I daresay I should feel the same in\nyour place \u2013 though I don\u2019t think I should have said some of the things you\u2019ve chosen to\nsay.",
    "But you can\u2019t alter facts.",
    "Rupert and I care for each other.",
    "And although I\u2019m sorry I\nreally don\u2019t see what you can do about it.\u2019\n\u2018Do about it I shall speak to your father \u2013 at once.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Poor Father.",
    "Must you really worry him about it\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll know just what to do.\u2019\n\u2018He really can\u2019t do anything at all.",
    "And it will simply worry him dreadfully.\u2019\nThat had been the beginning of a really shattering time.",
    "Averil at the heart of the storm had remained cool and apparently unperturbed.",
    "But also completely obdurate.",
    "Joan had repeated to Rodney again and again \u2018I can\u2019t help feeling it\u2019s all a pose on her\npart.",
    "It\u2019s not as though Averil were given to really strong feelings of any kind.\u2019\nBut Rodney had shaken his head.",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t understand Averil.",
    "With Averil it is less her senses than her mind and heart.",
    "When she loves she loves so deeply that I doubt if she will ever quite get over it.\u2019\n\u2018Oh Rodney I really do think that is nonsense After all I know Averil better than you\ndo.",
    "I\u2019m her mother.\u2019\n\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean that you really know the least thing about her.",
    "Averil has always\nunderstated things from choice \u2013 no perhaps from necessity.",
    "Feeling a thing deeply she\nbelittles it purposely in words.\u2019\n\u2018That sounds very farfetched to me.\u2019\nRodney said slowly \u2018Well you can take it from me that it isn\u2019t.",
    "It\u2019s true.\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t help thinking that you are exaggerating what is simply a silly schoolgirl\nflirtation.",
    "She\u2019s been flattered and likes to imagine \u2013\u2019\nRodney had interrupted her.",
    "\u2018Joan my dear \u2013 it\u2019s no good trying to reassure yourself by saying things that you\nyourself don\u2019t believe.",
    "Averil\u2019s passion for Cargill is serious.\u2019\n\u2018Then it\u2019s disgraceful of him \u2013 absolutely disgraceful \u2026\u2019\n\u2018Yes that\u2019s what the world will say all right.",
    "But put yourself in the poor devil\u2019s place.",
    "A wife who\u2019s a permanent invalid and all the passion and beauty of Averil\u2019s young\ngenerous heart offered to you on a platter.",
    "All the eagerness and freshness of her mind.\u2019\n\u2018Twenty years older than she is\u2019\n\u2018I know I know.",
    "If he were only ten years younger the temptation wouldn\u2019t be so\ngreat.\u2019\n\u2018He must be a horrid man \u2013 perfectly horrid.\u2019\nRodney sighed.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s not.",
    "He\u2019s a fine and very humane man \u2013 a man with an intense enthusiastic love\nfor his profession \u2013 a man who has done outstanding work.",
    "Incidentally a man who has\nalways been unvaryingly kind and gentle to an ailing wife.\u2019\n\u2018Now you are trying to make him out a kind of saint.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Far from it.",
    "And most saints Joan have had their passions.",
    "They were seldom\nbloodless men and women.",
    "No Cargill\u2019s human enough.",
    "Human enough to fall in love\nand to suffer.",
    "Human enough probably to wreck his own life \u2013 and to nullify his lifework.",
    "It all depends.\u2019\n\u2018Depends on what\u2019\nRodney said slowly \u2018It depends on our daughter.",
    "On how strong she is \u2013 and how\nclearsighted.\u2019\nJoan said energetically \u2018We must get her away from here.",
    "How about sending her on a\ncruise To the northern capitals \u2013 or the Greek Islands Something like that.\u2019\nRodney smiled.",
    "\u2018Aren\u2019t you thinking of the treatment applied to your old school friend Blanche\nHaggard It didn\u2019t work very well in her case remember.\u2019\n\u2018Do you mean that Averil would come rushing back from some foreign port\u2019\n\u2018I rather doubt whether Averil would even start.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense.",
    "We would insist.\u2019\n\u2018Joan dear do try and envisage realities.",
    "You cannot apply force to an adult young\nwoman.",
    "We can neither lock Averil in her bedroom nor force her to leave Crayminster \u2013\nand actually I don\u2019t want to do either.",
    "Those things are only palliatives.",
    "Averil can only be\ninfluenced by factors that she respects.\u2019\n\u2018And those are\u2019\n\u2018Reality.",
    "Truth.\u2019\n\u2018Why don\u2019t you go to him \u2013 to Rupert Cargill.",
    "Threaten him with the scandal.\u2019\nAgain Rodney sighed.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m afraid terribly afraid Joan of precipitating matters.\u2019\nWhat do you mean\u2019\n\u2018That Cargill will throw up everything and that they will go away together.\u2019\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t that be the end of his career\u2019\n\u2018Undoubtedly.",
    "I don\u2019t suppose it would come under the heading of unprofessional\nconduct but it would completely alienate public opinion in his special circumstances.\u2019\n\u2018Then surely if he realizes that \u2013\u2019\nRodney said impatiently \u2018He\u2019s not quite sane at the moment.",
    "Don\u2019t you understand\nanything at all about love Joan\u2019\nWhich was a ridiculous question to ask She said bitterly\n\u2018Not that kind of love I\u2019m thankful to say \u2026\u2019\nAnd then Rodney had taken her quite by surprise.",
    "He had smiled at her had said\n\u2018Poor little Joan\u2019 very gently had kissed her and had gone quietly away.",
    "It was nice of him she thought to realize how unhappy she was over the whole\nmiserable business.",
    "Yes it had indeed been an anxious time.",
    "Averil silent not speaking to anybody \u2013\nsometimes not even replying when her mother spoke to her.",
    "I did my best thought Joan.",
    "But what are you to do with a girl who won\u2019t even listen\nPale wearily polite Averil would say\n\u2018Really Mother must we go on like this Talking and talking and talking I do make\nallowances for your point of view but won\u2019t you just accept the plain truth that nothing\nyou can say or do will make the least difference\u2019\nSo it had gone on until that afternoon in September when Averil her face a little paler\nthan usual had said to them both\n\u2018I think I\u2019d better tell you.",
    "Rupert and I don\u2019t feel we can go on like this any longer.",
    "We are going away together.",
    "I hope his wife will divorce him.",
    "But if she won\u2019t it makes no\ndifference.\u2019\nJoan had started on an energetic protest but Rodney had stopped her.",
    "\u2018Leave this to me Joan if you don\u2019t mind.",
    "Averil I must talk to you.",
    "Come into my\nstudy.\u2019\nAveril had said with a very faint smile \u2018Quite like a headmaster aren\u2019t you Father.\u2019\nJoan burst out \u2018I\u2019m Averil\u2019s mother I insist \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Please Joan.",
    "I want to talk to Averil alone.",
    "Would you mind leaving us\u2019\nThere had been so much quiet decision in his tone that she had half turned to leave the\nroom.",
    "It was Averil\u2019s low clear voice that stopped her.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t go away Mother.",
    "I don\u2019t want you to go away.",
    "Anything Father says to me I\u2019d\nrather he said in front of you.\u2019\nWell at least that showed thought Joan that being a mother had some importance.",
    "What a very odd way Averil and her father had of looking at each other a wary\nmeasuring unfriendly way like two antagonists on the stage.",
    "Then Rodney smiled slightly and said \u2018I see.",
    "Afraid\u2019\nAveril\u2019s answer came cool and slightly surprised \u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean\nFather.\u2019\nRodney said with sudden irrelevance \u2018A pity you weren\u2019t a boy Averil.",
    "There are\ntimes when you are quite uncannily like your GreatUncle Henry.",
    "He had a wonderful eye\nfor the best way to conceal the weakness in his own case or to expose the weakness of his\nopponent\u2019s case.\u2019\nAveril said quickly \u2018There isn\u2019t any weakness in my case.\u2019\nRodney said deliberately \u2018I shall prove to you that there is.\u2019\nJoan exclaimed sharply\u2018Of course you are not going to do anything so wicked or so\n\n\ffoolish Averil.",
    "Your father and I will not allow it.\u2019\nAnd at that Averil had smiled just a little and had looked not at her mother but at her\nfather offering as it were her mother\u2019s remark to him.",
    "Rodney said \u2018Please Joan leave this to me.\u2019\n\u2018I think\u2019 said Averil \u2018that Mother is perfectly entitled to say just what she thinks.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you Averil\u2019 said Joan.",
    "\u2018I am certainly going to do so.",
    "My dear child you must\nsee that what you propose is quite out of the question.",
    "You are young and romantic and\nyou see everything in quite a false light.",
    "What you do on an impulse now you will bitterly\nregret later.",
    "And think of the sorrow you will cause your father and me.",
    "Have you thought\nof that I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to cause us pain \u2013 we have always loved you so dearly.\u2019\nAveril listened quite patiently but she did not reply.",
    "She had never taken her eyes from\nher father\u2019s face.",
    "When Joan finished Averil was still looking at Rodney and there was still a faint\nslightly mocking smile on her lips.",
    "\u2018Well Father\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Have you anything to add\u2019\n\u2018Not to add\u2019 said Rodney.",
    "\u2018But I have something of my own to say.\u2019\n\u2018Averil looked at him inquiringly.",
    "\u2018Averil\u2019 said Rodney \u2018do you understand exactly what a marriage is\u2019\n\u2018Averil\u2019s eyes opened slightly.",
    "She paused and then said \u2018Are you telling me that it is\na sacrament\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 said Rodney.",
    "\u2018I may consider it as a sacrament or I may not.",
    "What I am telling\nyou is that marriage is a contract.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 said Averil.",
    "She seemed a little just a little taken aback.",
    "\u2018Marriage\u2019 said Rodney \u2018is a contract entered into by two people both of adult years\nin the full possession of their faculties and with a full knowledge of what they are\nundertaking.",
    "It is a specification of partnership and each partner binds himself and herself\nspecifically to honour the terms of that contract \u2013 that is to stand by each other in certain\neventualities \u2013 in sickness and in health for richer for poorer for better for worse.",
    "\u2018Because those words are uttered in a church and with the approval and benediction of\na priest they are none the less a contract just as any agreement entered into between two\npeople in good faith is a contract.",
    "Because some of the obligations undertaken are not\nenforcible in a court of law they are none the less binding on the persons who have\nassumed them.",
    "I think you will agree that equitably that is so.\u2019\nThere was a pause and then Averil said \u2018That may have been true once.",
    "But marriage\nis looked upon differently nowadays and a great many people are not married in church\nand do not use the words of the church service.\u2019\n\u2018That may be so.",
    "But eighteen years ago Rupert Cargill did bind himself by using\n\n\fthose words in a church and I challenge you to say that he did not at that time utter those\nwords in good faith and meaning to carry them out.\u2019\nAveril shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Rodney said \u2018Will you admit that although not legally enforcible Rupert Cargill did\nenter into such a contract with the woman who is his wife He envisaged at the time the\npossibilities of poverty and of sickness and directly specified them as not affecting the\npermanence of the bond.\u2019\nAveril had gone very white.",
    "She said \u2018I don\u2019t know where you think you are getting\nby all this.\u2019\n\u2018I want an admission from you that marriage is apart from all sentimental feeling and\nthinking an ordinary business contract.",
    "Do you admit that or don\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll admit it.\u2019\n\u2018And Rupert Cargill proposes to break that contract with your connivance\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018With no regard for the due rights and privileges of the other party to the contract\u2019\n\u2018She will be all right.",
    "It\u2019s not as though she were so terribly fond of Rupert.",
    "All she\nthinks of is her own health and \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Rodney interrupted her sharply \u2018I don\u2019t want sentiment from you Averil.",
    "I want an\nadmission of fact.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not sentimental.\u2019\n\u2018You are.",
    "You have no knowledge at all of Mrs. Cargill\u2019s thoughts and feelings.",
    "You\nare imagining them to suit yourself.",
    "All I want from you is the admission that she has\nrights.\u2019\nAveril flung her head back.",
    "\u2018Very well.",
    "She has rights.\u2019\n\u2018Then you are now quite clear exactly what it is you are doing\u2019\n\u2018Have you finished Father\u2019\n\u2018No I have one more thing to say.",
    "You realize don\u2019t you that Cargill is doing very\nvaluable and important work that his methods in treating tuberculosis have met with such\nstriking success that he is a very prominent figure in the medical world and that\nunfortunately a man\u2019s private affairs can affect his public career.",
    "That means that Cargill\u2019s\nwork his usefulness to humanity will be seriously affected if not destroyed by what you\nare both proposing to do.\u2019\nAveril said \u2018Are you trying to persuade me that it\u2019s my duty to give Rupert up so that\nhe can continue to benefit humanity\u2019\nThere was a faint sneer in her voice.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 said Rodney.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m thinking of the poor devil himself \u2026\u2019\n\n\fThere was sudden vehement feeling in his voice.",
    "\u2018You can take it from me Averil that a man who\u2019s not doing the work he wants to do\n\u2013 the work he was made to do \u2013 is only half a man.",
    "I tell you as surely as I\u2019m standing\nhere that if you take Rupert Cargill away from his work and make it impossible for him to\ngo on with that work the day will come when you will have to stand by and see the man\nyou love unhappy unfulfilled \u2013 old before his time \u2013 tired and disheartened \u2013 only living\nwith half his life.",
    "And if you think your love or any woman\u2019s love can make up to him\nfor that then I tell you plainly that you\u2019re a damned sentimental little fool.\u2019\nHe stopped.",
    "He leaned back in his chair.",
    "He passed his hand through his hair.",
    "Averil said \u2018You say all this to me.",
    "But how do I know \u2013\u2019 She broke off and began\nagain \u2018How do I know \u2013\u2019\n\u2018That it\u2019s true I can only say that it\u2019s what I believe to be true and that it is what I\nknow of my own knowledge.",
    "I\u2019m speaking to you Averil as a man \u2013 as well as a father.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Averil.",
    "\u2018I see \u2026\u2019\nRodney said and his voice was tired now and sounded muffled\n\u2018It\u2019s up to you Averil to examine what I have told you and to accept or reject it.",
    "I\nbelieve you have courage and clearsightedness.\u2019\nAveril went slowly towards the door.",
    "She stopped with her hand on the handle and\nlooked back.",
    "Joan was startled by the sudden bitter vindictiveness of her voice when she spoke.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t imagine\u2019 she said \u2018that I shall ever be grateful to you Father.",
    "I think \u2013 I think I\nhate you.\u2019\nAnd she went out and closed the door behind her.",
    "Joan made a motion to go after her but Rodney stopped her with a gesture.",
    "\u2018Leave her alone\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Leave her alone.",
    "Don\u2019t you understand We\u2019ve won \u2026\u2019\n\n\fChapter Eight\nAnd that Joan reflected had been the end of that.",
    "Averil had gone about very silent answering in monosyllables when she was spoken\nto never spoke if she could help it.",
    "She had got thinner and paler.",
    "A month later she had expressed a wish to go to London and train in a secretarial\nschool.",
    "Rodney had assented at once.",
    "Averil had left them with no pretence of distress over the\nparting.",
    "When she had come home on a visit three months later she had been quite normal in\nmanner and had seemed from her account to be having quite a gay life in London.",
    "Joan was relieved and expressed her relief to Rodney.",
    "\u2018The whole thing has blown over completely.",
    "I never thought for a moment it was\nreally serious \u2013 just one of those silly fancies girls get.\u2019\nRodney looked at her smiled and said \u2018Poor little Joan.\u2019\nThat phrase of his always annoyed her.",
    "\u2018Well you must admit it was worrying at the time.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 he said \u2018it was certainly worrying.",
    "But it wasn\u2019t your worry was it Joan\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean Anything that affects the children upsets me far more than it\nupsets them.\u2019\n\u2018Does it\u2019 Rodney said.",
    "\u2018I wonder \u2026\u2019\nIt was true Joan thought that there was now a certain coldness between Averil and her\nfather.",
    "They had always been such friends.",
    "Now there seemed little except formal\npoliteness between them.",
    "On the other hand Averil had been quite charming in her cool\nnoncommittal way to her mother.",
    "I expect thought Joan that she appreciates me better now that she doesn\u2019t live at\nhome.",
    "She herself certainly welcomed Averil\u2019s visits.",
    "Averil\u2019s cool good sense seemed to\nease things in the household.",
    "Barbara was now grown up and was proving difficult.",
    "Joan was increasingly distressed by her younger daughter\u2019s choice of friends.",
    "She\nseemed to have no kind of discrimination.",
    "There were plenty of nice girls in Crayminster\nbut Barbara out of sheer perversity it seemed would have none of them.",
    "\u2018They\u2019re so hideously dull Mother.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense Barbara.",
    "I\u2019m sure both Mary and Alison are charming girls full of fun.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018They\u2019re perfectly awful.",
    "They wear snoods.\u2019\nJoan had stared bewildered.",
    "\u2018Really Barbara \u2013 what do you mean What can it matter\u2019\n\u2018It does.",
    "It\u2019s a kind of symbol.\u2019\n\u2018I think you\u2019re talking nonsense darling.",
    "There\u2019s Pamela Grayling \u2013 her mother used\nto be a great friend of mine.",
    "Why not go about with her a bit more\u2019\nOh Mother she\u2019s hopelessly dreary not amusing a bit.\u2019\n\u2018Well I think they\u2019re all very nice girls.\u2019\n\u2018Yes nice and deadly.",
    "And what does it matter what you think\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s very rude Barbara.\u2019\n\u2018Well what I mean is you don\u2019t have to go about with them.",
    "So it\u2019s what I think\nmatters.",
    "I like Betty Earle and Primrose Deane but you always stick your nose in the air\nwhen I bring them to tea.\u2019\n\u2018Well frankly darling they are rather dreadful \u2013 Betty\u2019s father runs those awful\ncharabanc tours and simply hasn\u2019t got an h.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s got lots of money though.\u2019\n\u2018Money isn\u2019t everything Barbara.\u2019\n\u2018The whole point is Mother can I choose my own friends or can\u2019t I\u2019\n\u2018Of course you can Barbara but you must let yourself be guided by me.",
    "You are very\nyoung still.\u2019\n\u2018That means I can\u2019t.",
    "It\u2019s pretty sickening the way I can\u2019t do a single thing I want to do\nThis place is an absolute prison house.\u2019\nAnd it was just then that Rodney had come in and had said \u2018What\u2019s a prison house\u2019\nBarbara cried out \u2018Home is\u2019\nAnd instead of taking the matter seriously Rodney had simply laughed and had said\nteasingly \u2018Poor little Barbara \u2013 treated like a black slave.\u2019\n\u2018Well I am.\u2019\n\u2018Quite right too.",
    "I approve of slavery for daughters.\u2019\nAnd Barbara had hugged him and said breathlessly \u2018Darling Dads you are so \u2013 so \u2013\nridiculous.",
    "I never can be annoyed with you for long.\u2019\nJoan had begun indignantly \u2018I should hope not \u2013\u2019\nBut Rodney was laughing and when Barbara had gone out of the room he had said\n\u2018Don\u2019t take things too seriously Joan.",
    "Young fillies have to kick up their heels a bit.\u2019\n\u2018But these awful friends of hers \u2013\u2019\n\u2018A momentary phase of liking the flamboyant.",
    "It will pass.",
    "Don\u2019t worry Joan.\u2019\n\n\fVery easy Joan had thought indignantly to say \u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 What would happen to\nthem all if she didn\u2019t worry Rodney was far too easy going and he couldn\u2019t possibly\nunderstand a mother\u2019s feelings.",
    "Yet trying as Barbara\u2019s choice of girl friends had been it was as nothing to the anxiety\noccasioned by the men she seemed to like.",
    "George Harmon and that very objectionable young Wilmore \u2013 not only a member of\nthe rival solicitor\u2019s firm a firm that undertook the more dubious legal business of the\ntown but a young man who drank too much talked too loudly and was too fond of the\nrace track.",
    "It was with young Wilmore that Barbara had disappeared from the Town Hall\non the night of the Christmas Charity Dance and had reappeared five dances later sending\na guilty but defiant glance towards where her mother was sitting.",
    "They had been sitting out it seemed on the roof \u2013 a thing that only fast girls did so\nJoan told Barbara and it had distressed her very much.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t be so Edwardian Mother.",
    "It\u2019s absurd.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not at all Edwardian.",
    "And let me tell you Barbara a lot of the old ideas about\nchaperonage are coming back into favour.",
    "Girls don\u2019t go about with young men as they\ndid ten years ago.\u2019\n\u2018Really Mother anyone would think I was going off weekending with Tom\nWilmore.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t talk like that Barbara I won\u2019t have it.",
    "And I heard you were seen in the Dog\nand Duck with George Harmon.\u2019\n\u2018Oh we were just doing a pub crawl.\u2019\n\u2018Well you\u2019re far too young to do anything of the kind.",
    "I don\u2019t like the way girls drink\nspirits nowadays.\u2019\n\u2018I was only having beer.",
    "Actually we were playing darts.\u2019\n\u2018Well I don\u2019t like it Barbara.",
    "And what\u2019s more I won\u2019t have it.",
    "I don\u2019t like George\nHarmon or Tom Wilmore and I won\u2019t have them in the house any more do you\nunderstand\u2019\n\u2018O.K.",
    "Mother it\u2019s your house.\u2019\n\u2018Anyway I don\u2019t see what you like in them.\u2019\nBarbara shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u2018Oh I don\u2019t know.",
    "They\u2019re exciting.\u2019\n\u2018Well I won\u2019t have them asked to the house do you hear\u2019\nAfter that Joan had been annoyed when Rodney brought young Harmon home to\nSunday supper one night.",
    "It was she felt so weak of Rodney.",
    "She herself put on her most\nglacial manner and the young man seemed suitably abashed in spite of the friendly way\nRodney talked to him and the pains he took to put him at his ease.",
    "George Harmon\nalternately talked too loud or mumbled boasted and then became apologetic.",
    "Later that night Joan took Rodney to task with some sharpness.",
    "\u2018Surely you must realize I\u2019d told Barbara I wouldn\u2019t have him here\u2019\n\u2018I knew Joan but that\u2019s a mistake.",
    "Barbara has very little judgment.",
    "She takes people\nat their own valuation.",
    "She doesn\u2019t know the shoddy from the real.",
    "Seeing people against\nan alien background she doesn\u2019t know where she is.",
    "That\u2019s why she needs to see people\nagainst her own background.",
    "She\u2019s been thinking of young Harmon as a dangerous and\ndashing figure not just a foolish and boastful young man who drinks too much and has\nnever done a proper day\u2019s work in his life.\u2019\n\u2018I could have told her that\u2019\nRodney smiled.",
    "\u2018Oh Joan dear nothing that you and I say is going to impress the younger\ngeneration.\u2019\nThe truth of that was made plain to Joan when Averil came down on one of her brief\nvisits.",
    "This time it was Tom Wilmore who was being entertained.",
    "Against Averil\u2019s cool\ncritical distaste Tom did not show to advantage.",
    "Afterwards Joan caught a snatch of conversation between the sisters.",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t like him Averil\u2019\nAnd Averil hunching disdainful shoulders had replied crisply \u2018I think he\u2019s dreadful.",
    "Your taste in men Barbara is really too awful.\u2019\nThereafter Wilmore had disappeared from the scene and the fickle Barbara had\nmurmured one day \u2018Tom Wilmore Oh but he\u2019s dreadful.\u2019 With complete and wideeyed\nconviction.",
    "Joan set herself to have tennis parties and ask people to the house but Barbara refused\nstoutly to cooperate.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t fuss so Mother.",
    "You\u2019re always wanting to ask people.",
    "I hate having people\nand you always will ask such terrible duds.\u2019\nOffended Joan said sharply that she washed her hands of Barbara\u2019s amusement.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m\nsure I don\u2019t know what you want\u2019\n\u2018I just want to be let alone.\u2019\nBarbara was really a most difficult child Joan said sharply to Rodney.",
    "Rodney agreed\na little frown between his eyes.",
    "\u2018If she would only just say what she wants\u2019 Joan continued.",
    "\u2018She doesn\u2019t know herself.",
    "She\u2019s very young Joan.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s just why she needs to have things decided for her.\u2019\n\u2018No my dear \u2013 she\u2019s got to find her own feet.",
    "Just let her be \u2013 let her bring her friends\nhere if she wants to but don\u2019t organize things.",
    "That\u2019s what seems to antagonize the\nyoung.\u2019\n\n\fSo like a man Joan thought with some exasperation.",
    "All for leaving things alone and\nbeing vague.",
    "Poor dear Rodney he always had been rather vague now she came to think\nof it.",
    "It was she who had to be the practical one And yet everyone said that he was such a\nshrewd lawyer.",
    "Joan remembered an evening when Rodney had read from the local paper an\nannouncement of George Harmon\u2019s marriage to Primrose Deane and had added with a\nteasing smile\n\u2018An old flame of yours eh Babs\u2019\nBarbara had laughed with considerable amusement.",
    "\u2018I know.",
    "I was awfully keen on him.",
    "He really is pretty dreadful isn\u2019t he I mean he\nreally is.\u2019\n\u2018I always thought him a most unprepossessing young man.",
    "I couldn\u2019t imagine what\nyou saw in him.\u2019\n\u2018No more can I now.\u2019 Barbara at eighteen spoke detachedly of the follies of seventeen.",
    "\u2018But really you know Dads I did think I was in love with him.",
    "I thought Mother would\ntry to part us and then I was going to run away with him and if you or Mother stopped us\nthen I made up my mind I should put my head in the gas oven and kill myself.\u2019\n\u2018Quite the Juliet touch\u2019\nWith a shade of disapproval Barbara said \u2018I meant it Daddy.",
    "After all if you can\u2019t\nbear a thing you just have to kill yourself.\u2019\nAnd Joan unable to bear keeping silent any longer broke in sharply.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t say such wicked things Barbara.",
    "You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2019\n\u2018I forgot you were there Mother.",
    "Of course you wouldn\u2019t ever do a thing like that.",
    "You\u2019d always be calm and sensible whatever happened.\u2019\n\u2018I should hope so indeed.\u2019\nJoan kept her temper with a little difficulty.",
    "She said to Rodney when Barbara had left\nthe room\n\u2018You shouldn\u2019t encourage the child in such nonsense.\u2019\n\u2018Oh she might as well talk it out of her system.\u2019\n\u2018Of course she\u2019d never really do any of these dreadful things she talks about.\u2019\nRodney was silent and Joan looked at him in surprise.",
    "\u2018Surely you don\u2019t think \u2013\u2019\n\u2018No no not really.",
    "Not when she\u2019s older when she\u2019s got her balance.",
    "But Barbara is\nvery unstable emotionally Joan we might as well face it.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all so ridiculous\u2019\n\u2018Yes to us \u2013 who have a sense of proportion.",
    "But not to her.",
    "She\u2019s always in deadly\nearnest.",
    "She can\u2019t see beyond the mood of the moment.",
    "She has no detachment and no\n\n\fhumour.",
    "Sexually she is precocious \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Really Rodney You make things sound like \u2013 like one of those horrid cases in the\npolice court.\u2019\n\u2018Horrid cases in the police court concern living human beings remember.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but nicely brought up girls like Barbara don\u2019t \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t what Joan\u2019\n\u2018Must we talk like this\u2019\nRodney sighed.",
    "\u2018No.",
    "No of course not.",
    "But I wish yes I really do wish that Barbara could meet some\ndecent young fellow and fall properly in love with him.\u2019\nAnd after that it had really seemed like an answer to prayer when young William\nWray had come home from Iraq to stay with his aunt Lady Herriot.",
    "Joan had seen him first one day about a week after his arrival.",
    "He had been ushered\ninto the drawingroom one afternoon when Barbara was out.",
    "Joan had looked up surprised\nfrom her writing table and had seen a tall sturdily built young man with a jutting out chin\na very pink face and a pair of steady blue eyes.",
    "Blushing still pinker Bill Wray had mumbled to his collar that he was Lady Herriot\u2019s\nnephew and that he had called \u2013 er \u2013 to return Miss Scudamore\u2019s racket which she had \u2013 er\n\u2013 left behind the other day.",
    "Joan pulled her wits together and greeted him graciously.",
    "Barbara was so careless she said.",
    "Left her things all over the place.",
    "Barbara was out at\nthe moment but probably she would be back before long.",
    "Mr Wray must stay and have\nsome tea.",
    "Mr Wray was quite willing it seemed so Joan rang the bell for tea and inquired after\nMr Wray\u2019s aunt.",
    "Lady Herriot\u2019s health occupied about five minutes and then conversation began to halt\na little.",
    "Mr Wray was not very helpful.",
    "He remained very pink in the face and sat very bolt\nupright and had a vague look of suffering some internal agony.",
    "Luckily tea came and made\na diversion.",
    "Joan was still prattling kindly but with a slight sense of effort when Rodney much to\nher relief returned a little earlier than usual from the office.",
    "Rodney was very helpful.",
    "He\ntalked of Iraq drew the boy out with some simple questions and presently some of Bill\nWray\u2019s agonized stiffness began to relax.",
    "Soon he was talking almost easily.",
    "Presently\nRodney took him off to his study.",
    "It was nearly seven o\u2019clock when Bill still it seemed\nreluctantly took his departure.",
    "\u2018Nice lad\u2019 said Rodney.",
    "\u2018Yes quite.",
    "Rather shy.\u2019\n\u2018Decidedly.\u2019 Rodney seemed amused.",
    "\u2018But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s usually quite so\n\n\fdiffident.\u2019\n\u2018What a frightfully long time he stayed\u2019\n\u2018Over two hours.\u2019\n\u2018You must be terribly tired Rodney.\u2019\n\u2018Oh no I enjoyed it.",
    "He\u2019s got a very good headpiece that boy and rather an unusual\noutlook on things.",
    "The philosophic bent of mind.",
    "He\u2019s got character as well as brains.",
    "Yes\nI liked him.\u2019\n\u2018He must have liked you \u2013 to stay talking as long as he did.\u2019\nRodney\u2019s look of amusement returned.",
    "\u2018Oh he wasn\u2019t staying to talk to me.",
    "He was hoping for Barbara\u2019s return.",
    "Come Joan\ndon\u2019t you know love when you see it The poor fellow was stiff with embarrassment.",
    "That\u2019s why he was as red as a beetroot.",
    "It must have taken a great effort for him to nerve\nhimself to come here \u2013 and when he did no glimpse of his lady.",
    "Yes one of those cases of\nlove at first sight.\u2019\nPresently when Barbara came hurrying into the house just in time for dinner Joan\nsaid\n\u2018One of your young men has been here Barbara Lady Herriot\u2019s nephew.",
    "He brought\nback your racket.\u2019\n\u2018Oh Bill Wray So he did find it It seemed to have disappeared completely the other\nevening.\u2019\n\u2018He was here some time\u2019 said Joan.",
    "\u2018Pity I missed him.",
    "I went to the pictures with the Crabbes.",
    "A frightfully stupid film.",
    "Did you get awfully bored with Bill\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 said Rodney.",
    "I liked him.",
    "We talked Near Eastern politics.",
    "You\u2019d have been\nbored I expect.\u2019\n\u2018I like to hear about queer parts of the world.",
    "I\u2019d love to travel.",
    "I get so fed up always\nstaying in Crayminster.",
    "At any rate Bill is different.\u2019\n\u2018You can always train for a job\u2019 suggested Rodney.",
    "\u2018Oh a job\u2019 Barbara wrinkled up her nose.",
    "\u2018You know Dads I\u2019m an idle devil.",
    "I don\u2019t\nlike work.\u2019\n\u2018No more do most people I suspect\u2019 said Rodney.",
    "Barbara rushed at him and hugged him.",
    "\u2018You work much too hard.",
    "I\u2019ve always thought so.",
    "It\u2019s a shame\u2019\nThen releasing her hold she said \u2018I\u2019ll give Bill a ring.",
    "He said something about going\nto the point to point over at Marsden \u2026\u2019\nRodney stood looking after her as she walked away towards the telephone at the back\nof the hall.",
    "It was an odd look questioning uncertain.",
    "He had liked Bill Wray yes undoubtedly he had liked Bill from the first.",
    "Why then\nhad he looked so worried so harassed when Barbara had burst in and announced that she\nand Bill were engaged and they meant to be married at once so that she could go back to\nBaghdad with him\nBill was young well connected with money of his own and good prospects.",
    "Why\nthen did Rodney demur and suggest a longer engagement Why did he go about\nfrowning looking uncertain and perplexed\nAnd then just before the marriage that sudden outburst that insistence that Barbara\nwas too young\nOh well Barbara had soon settled that objection and six months after she had married\nher Bill and departed for Baghdad Averil in her turn had announced her engagement to a\nstockbroker a man called Edward HarrisonWilmott.",
    "He was a quiet pleasant man of about thirtyfour and extremely well off.",
    "So really Joan thought everything seemed to be turning out splendidly.",
    "Rodney was\nrather quiet about Averil\u2019s engagement but when she pressed him he said \u2018Yes yes it\u2019s\nthe best thing.",
    "He\u2019s a nice fellow.\u2019\nAfter Averil\u2019s marriage Joan and Rodney were alone in the house.",
    "Tony after training at an agricultural college and then failing to pass his exams and\naltogether causing them a good deal of anxiety had finally gone out to South Africa where\na client of Rodney\u2019s had a big orange farm in Rhodesia.",
    "Tony wrote them enthusiastic letters though not very lengthy ones.",
    "Then he had\nwritten and announced his engagement to a girl from Durban.",
    "Joan was rather upset at the\nidea of her son marrying a girl they had never even seen.",
    "She had no money either \u2013 and\nreally as she said to Rodney what did they know about her Nothing at all.",
    "Rodney said that it was Tony\u2019s funeral and that they must hope for the best.",
    "She\nlooked a nice girl he thought from the photographs Tony had sent and she seemed\nwilling to begin with Tony in a small way up in Rhodesia.",
    "\u2018And I suppose they\u2019ll spend their entire lives out there and hardly ever come home.",
    "Tony ought to have been forced to go into the firm \u2013 I said so at the time\u2019\nRodney had smiled and said that he wasn\u2019t very good at forcing people to do things.",
    "\u2018No but really Rodney you ought to have insisted.",
    "He would soon have settled down.",
    "People do.\u2019\nYes Rodney said that was true.",
    "But it was he thought too great a risk.",
    "Risk Joan said she didn\u2019t understand.",
    "What did he mean by risk\nRodney said he meant the risk that the boy mightn\u2019t be happy.",
    "Joan said she sometimes lost patience with all this talk of happiness.",
    "Nobody seemed\nto think of anything else.",
    "Happiness wasn\u2019t the only thing in life.",
    "There were other things\nmuch more important.",
    "Such as Rodney had asked\n\n\fWell Joan said \u2013 after a moment\u2019s hesitation \u2013 duty for instance.",
    "Rodney said that surely it could never be a duty to become a solicitor.",
    "Slightly annoyed Joan replied that he knew perfectly what she meant.",
    "It was Tony\u2019s\nduty to please his father and not disappoint him.",
    "\u2018Tony hasn\u2019t disappointed me.\u2019\nBut surely Joan exclaimed Rodney didn\u2019t like his only son being far away half across\nthe world living where they could never see the boy.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 said Rodney with a sigh.",
    "\u2018I must admit that I miss Tony very much.",
    "He was such\na sunny cheerful creature to have about the house.",
    "Yes I miss him \u2026\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what I say.",
    "You should have been firm\u2019\n\u2018After all Joan it\u2019s Tony\u2019s life.",
    "Not ours.",
    "Ours is over and done with for better or\nworse \u2013 the active part of it I mean.\u2019\n\u2018Yes \u2013 well \u2013 I suppose that\u2019s so in a way.\u2019\nShe thought a minute and then she said \u2018Well it\u2019s been a very nice life.",
    "And still is of\ncourse.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m glad of that.\u2019\nHe was smiling at her.",
    "Rodney had a nice smile a teasing smile.",
    "Sometimes he looked\nas though he was smiling at something that you yourself didn\u2019t see.",
    "\u2018The truth is\u2019 said Joan \u2018that you and I are really very well suited to each other.\u2019\n\u2018Yes we haven\u2019t had many quarrels.\u2019\n\u2018And then we\u2019ve been lucky with our children.",
    "It would have been terrible if they\u2019d\nturned out badly or been unhappy or something like that.\u2019\n\u2018Funny Joan\u2019 Rodney had said.",
    "\u2018Well but Rodney it really would have been very upsetting.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think anything would upset you for long Joan.\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019 she considered the point.",
    "\u2018Of course I have got a very equable temperament.",
    "I\nthink it\u2019s one\u2019s duty you know not to give way to things.\u2019\n\u2018An admirable and convenient sentiment\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s nice isn\u2019t it\u2019 said Joan smiling \u2018to feel one\u2019s made a success of things\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019 Rodney had sighed.",
    "\u2018Yes it must be very nice.\u2019\nJoan laughed and putting her hand on his arm gave it a little shake.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t be modest Rodney.",
    "No solicitor has got a bigger practice round here than you\nhave.",
    "It\u2019s far bigger than in Uncle Henry\u2019s time.\u2019\n\u2018Yes the firm is doing well.\u2019\n\u2018And there\u2019s more capital coming in with the new partner.",
    "Do you mind having a new\n\n\fpartner\u2019\nRodney shook his head.",
    "\u2018Oh no we need young blood.",
    "Both Alderman and I are getting on.\u2019\nYes she thought it was true.",
    "There was a lot of grey in Rodney\u2019s dark hair.",
    "Joan roused herself and glanced at her watch.",
    "The morning was passing quite quickly and there had been no recurrence of those\ndistressing chaotic thoughts which seemed to force themselves into her mind so\ninopportunely.",
    "Well that showed didn\u2019t it that \u2018discipline\u2019 was the watchword needed.",
    "To arrange\none\u2019s thoughts in an orderly manner recalling only those memories that were pleasant and\nsatisfactory.",
    "That is what she had done this morning \u2013 and see how quickly the morning\nhad passed.",
    "In about an hour and a half it would be lunch time.",
    "Perhaps she had better go\nout for a short stroll keeping quite near the rest house.",
    "That would just make a little\nchange before coming in to eat another of those hot heavy meals.",
    "She went into the bedroom put on her double felt hat and went out.",
    "The Arab boy was kneeling on the ground his face turned towards Mecca and was\nbending forward and straightening himself uttering words in a high nasal chant.",
    "The Indian coming up unseen said instructively just behind Joan\u2019s shoulder \u2018Him\nmake midday prayer.\u2019\nJoan nodded.",
    "The information she felt was unnecessary.",
    "She could see perfectly well\nwhat the boy was doing.",
    "\u2018Him say Allah very compassionate Allah very merciful.\u2019\n\u2018I know\u2019 said Joan and moved away strolling gently towards the barbed wire\nconglomeration that marked the railway station.",
    "She remembered having seen six or seven Arabs trying to move a dilapidated Ford that\nhad stuck in the sand all pulling and tugging in opposite directions and how her soninlaw William had explained to her that in addition to these well meant but abortive efforts\nthey were saying hopefully \u2018Allah is very merciful.\u2019\nAllah she thought had need to be since it was certain that nothing but a miracle\nwould extract the car if they all continued to tug in opposite directions.",
    "The curious thing was that they all seemed quite happy about it and enjoying\nthemselves.",
    "Inshallah they would say if God wills and would thereupon bend no\nintelligent endeavour on the satisfaction of their desires.",
    "It was not a way of living that\ncommended itself to Joan.",
    "One should take thought and make plans for the morrow.",
    "Though perhaps if one lived in the middle of nowhere like Tell Abu Hamid it might not be\nso necessary.",
    "If one were here for long reflected Joan one would forget even what day of the week\nit was \u2026\nAnd she thought Let me see today is Thursday \u2026 yes Thursday I got here on\n\n\fMonday night.",
    "She had arrived now at the tangle of barbed wire and she saw a little way beyond it a\nman in some kind of uniform with a rifle.",
    "He was leaning up against a large case and she\nsupposed he was guarding the station or the frontier.",
    "He seemed to be asleep and Joan thought she had better not go any farther in case he\nmight wake up and shoot her.",
    "It was the sort of thing she felt that would not be at all\nimpossible at Tell Abu Hamid.",
    "She retraced her steps making a slight detour so as to encircle the rest house.",
    "In that\nway she would eke out the time and run no risk of that strange feeling of agoraphobia if it\nhad been agoraphobia.",
    "Certainly she thought with approval the morning had gone very successfully.",
    "She had\ngone over in her mind the things for which she had to be thankful.",
    "Averil\u2019s marriage to\ndear Edward such a solid dependable sort of man \u2013 and so well off too Averil\u2019s house in\nLondon was quite delightful \u2013 so handy for Harrods.",
    "And Barbara\u2019s marriage.",
    "And Tony\u2019s\n\u2013 though that really wasn\u2019t quite so satisfactory \u2013 in fact they knew nothing about it \u2013 and\nTony himself was not as entirely satisfactory as a son should be.",
    "Tony should have\nremained in Crayminster and gone into Alderman Scudamore and Witney\u2019s.",
    "He should\nhave married a nice English girl fond of outdoor life and followed in his father\u2019s\nfootsteps.",
    "Poor Rodney with his dark hair streaked with grey and no son to succeed him at the\noffice.",
    "The truth was that Rodney had been much too weak with Tony.",
    "He should have put his\nfoot down.",
    "Firmness that was the thing.",
    "Why thought Joan where would Rodney be I\nshould like to know if I hadn\u2019t put my foot down She felt a warm little glow of self\napproval.",
    "Crippled with debts probably and trying to raise a mortgage like Farmer\nHoddesdon.",
    "She wondered if Rodney really quite appreciated what she had done for\nhim \u2026\nJoan stared ahead of her at the swimming line of the horizon.",
    "A queer watery effect.",
    "Of\ncourse she thought mirage\nYes that was it mirage \u2026 just like pools of water in the sand.",
    "Not at all what one\nthought of as mirage \u2013 she had always imagined trees and cities \u2013 something much more\nconcrete.",
    "But even this unspectacular watery effect was queer \u2013 it made one feel \u2013 what was\nreality\nMirage she thought mirage.",
    "The word seemed important.",
    "What had she been thinking of Oh of course Tony and how exceedingly selfish and\nthoughtless he had been.",
    "It had always been extremely difficult to get at Tony.",
    "He was so vague so apparently\nacquiescent and yet in his quiet amiable smiling way he did exactly as he liked.",
    "Tony\nhad never been quite so devoted to her as she felt a son ought to be to his mother.",
    "In fact\nhe really seemed to care for his father most.",
    "She remembered how Tony as a small boy of seven in the middle of the night had\nentered the dressingroom where Rodney was sleeping and had announced quietly and\nunromantically\n\u2018I think Father I must have eaten a toadstool instead of a mushroom because I have a\nvery bad pain and I think I am going to die.",
    "So I have come here to die with you.\u2019\nActually it had been nothing to do with toadstools or mushrooms.",
    "It had been acute\nappendicitis and the boy had been operated on within twentyfour hours.",
    "But it still\nseemed to Joan queer that the child should have gone to Rodney and not to her.",
    "Far more\nnatural for Tony to have come to his mother.",
    "Yes Tony had been trying in many ways.",
    "Lazy at school.",
    "Slack over games.",
    "And\nthough he was a very goodlooking boy and the kind of boy she was proud to take about\nwith her he never seemed to want to be taken about and had an irritating habit of melting\ninto the landscape just when she was looking for him.",
    "\u2018Protective colouring\u2019 Averil had called it Joan remembered.",
    "\u2018Tony is much cleverer\nat protective colouring than we are\u2019 she had said.",
    "Joan had not quite understood her meaning but she had felt vaguely a little hurt by\nit \u2026\nJoan looked at her watch.",
    "No need to get too hot walking.",
    "Back to the rest house now.",
    "It\nhad been an excellent morning \u2013 no incidents of any kind \u2013 no unpleasant thoughts no\nsensations of agoraphobia \u2013\nReally some inner voice in her exclaimed you are talking just like a hospital nurse.",
    "What do you think you are Joan Scudamore an invalid a mental case And why do you\nfeel so proud of yourself and yet so tired Is there anything extraordinary in having passed\na pleasant normal morning\nShe went quickly into the rest house and was delighted to see that there were tinned\npears for lunch as a change.",
    "After lunch she went and lay down on her bed.",
    "If she could sleep until tea time \u2026\nBut she did not feel even inclined to sleep.",
    "Her brain felt bright and wakeful.",
    "She lay\nthere with closed eyes but her body felt alert and tense as though it were waiting for\nsomething \u2026 as though it were watchful ready to defend itself against some lurking\ndanger.",
    "All her muscles were taut.",
    "I must relax Joan thought I must relax.",
    "But she couldn\u2019t relax.",
    "Her body was stiff and braced.",
    "Her heart was beating a little\nfaster than was normal.",
    "Her mind was alert and suspicious.",
    "The whole thing reminded her of something.",
    "She searched and at last the right\ncomparison came to her \u2013 a dentist\u2019s waitingroom.",
    "The feeling of something definitely unpleasant just ahead of you the determination to\nreassure yourself to put off thinking of it and the knowledge that each minute was\nbringing the ordeal nearer \u2026\n\n\fBut what ordeal \u2013 what was she expecting\nWhat was going to happen\nThe lizards she thought have all gone back into their holes \u2026 that\u2019s because there\u2019s a\nstorm coming \u2026 the quiet \u2013 before a storm \u2026 waiting \u2026 waiting \u2026\nGood Heavens she was getting quite incoherent again.",
    "Miss Gilbey \u2026 discipline \u2026 a Spiritual Retreat \u2026\nA Retreat She must meditate.",
    "There was something about repeating Om \u2026\nTheosophy Or Buddhism \u2026\nNo no stick to her own religion.",
    "Meditate on God.",
    "On the love of God.",
    "God \u2026 Our\nFather which art in Heaven \u2026\nHer own father \u2013 his squarely trimmed naval brown beard his deep piercing blue eyes\nhis liking for everything to be trim and shipshape in the house.",
    "A kindly martinet that was\nher father a typical retired Admiral.",
    "And her mother tall thin vague untidy with a\ncareless sweetness that made people even when she most exasperated them find all kinds\nof excuses for her.",
    "Her mother going out to parties with odd gloves and a crooked skirt and a hat pinned\naskew to a bun of iron grey hair and happily and serenely unconscious of anything amiss\nabout her appearance.",
    "And the anger of the Admiral \u2013 always directed on his daughters\nnever on his wife.",
    "\u2018Why can\u2019t you girls look after your mother What do you mean by letting her go out\nlike that I will not have such slackness\u2019 he would roar.",
    "And the three girls would say\nsubmissively\n\u2018No Father.\u2019 And afterwards to each other \u2018It\u2019s all very well but really Mother is\nimpossible\u2019\nJoan had been very fond of her mother of course but her fondness had not blinded her\nto the fact that her mother was really a very tiresome woman \u2013 her complete lack of\nmethod and consistency hardly atoned for by her gay irresponsibility and warmhearted\nimpulsiveness.",
    "It had come as quite a shock to Joan clearing up her mother\u2019s papers after her\nmother\u2019s death to come across a letter from her father written on the twentieth\nanniversary of their marriage.",
    "I grieve deeply that I cannot be with you today dear heart.",
    "I would like to tell you\nin this letter all that your love has meant to me all these years and how you are\nmore dear to me today than you have ever been before.",
    "Your love has been the\ncrowning blessing of my life and I thank God for it and for you \u2026\nSomehow she had never realized that her father felt quite like that about her mother \u2026\nJoan thought Rodney and I will have been married twentyfive years this December.",
    "Our silver wedding.",
    "How nice she thought if he were to write such a letter to me \u2026\nShe concocted a letter in her mind.",
    "Dearest Joan \u2013 I feel I must write down all I owe to you \u2013 and what you have\nmeant to me \u2013 You have no idea I am sure how your love has been the crowning\nblessing \u2026\nSomehow Joan thought breaking off this imaginative exercise it didn\u2019t seem very real.",
    "Impossible to imagine Rodney writing such a letter \u2026 much as he loved her \u2026 much as\nhe loved her \u2026\nWhy repeat that so defiantly Why feel such a queer cold little shiver What had she\nbeen thinking about before that\nOf course Joan came to herself with a shock.",
    "She was supposed to be engaged in\nspiritual meditation.",
    "Instead of that she had been thinking of mundane matters \u2013 of her\nfather and mother dead these many years.",
    "Dead leaving her alone.",
    "Alone in the desert.",
    "Alone in this very unpleasant prisonlike room.",
    "With nothing to think about but herself.",
    "She sprang up.",
    "No use lying here when one couldn\u2019t go to sleep.",
    "She hated these high rooms with their small gauzecovered windows.",
    "They hemmed\nyou in.",
    "They made you feel small insectlike.",
    "She wanted a big airy drawingroom with\nnice cheerful cretonnes and a crackling fire in the grate and people \u2013 lots of people \u2013\npeople you could go and see and people who would come and see you \u2026\nOh the train must come soon \u2013 it had got to come soon.",

    "Not too far away from the rest house just in\ncase \u2013 well just in case \u2026\nDescribe a large circle.",
    "Round and round.",
    "Like an animal.",

    "Yes\nhumiliating but there it was.",

    "Gar\u00e7on l\u2019addition.\u2019\nJoan blinked slightly for the last sentence had been practically joined to the one before\nit.",
    "The restaurant car attendant came hurrying up respectfully and it was borne in upon\nJoan that her travelling companion was a person of considerable importance.",
    "All that morning and afternoon they wound across the plains and then climbed slowly\nup into the Taurus.",
    "Sasha sat in her corner and read and smoked and occasionally made unexpected and\nsometimes embarrassing remarks.",
    "Joan found herself being fascinated by this strange\nwoman who came from a different world and whose mental processes were so totally\ndifferent from anything she herself had previously come across.",
    "The mingling of the impersonal and the intimate had an odd compelling charm for\nJoan.",
    "Sasha said to her suddenly\n\u2018You do not read \u2013 no And you do nothing with your hands.",
    "You do not knit.",
    "That is\nnot like most Englishwomen.",
    "And yet you look most English \u2013 yes you look exactly\nEnglish.\u2019\nJoan smiled.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve actually nothing to read.",
    "I was held up at Tell Abu Hamid owing to the\nbreakdown on the line so I got through all the literature I had with me.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018But you do not mind You did not feel it necessary to get something at Alep.",
    "No you\nare content just to sit and look out through the window at the mountains and yet you do\nnot see them \u2013 you look at something that you yourself see is it not so You experience in\nyour mind some great emotion or you have passed through one.",
    "You have a sorrow Or a\ngreat happiness\u2019\nJoan hesitated with a slight frown.",
    "Sasha burst out laughing.",
    "\u2018Ah but that is so English.",
    "You think it impertinent if I ask the questions that we\nRussians feel are so natural.",
    "It is curious that.",
    "If I were to ask you where you had been to\nwhat hotels and what scenery you had seen and if you have children and what do they do\nand have you travelled much and do you know a good hairdresser in London \u2013 all that\nyou would answer with pleasure.",
    "But if I ask something that comes into my mind \u2013 have\nyou a sorrow is your husband faithful \u2013 do you sleep much with men \u2013 what has been\nyour most beautiful experience in life \u2013 are you conscious of the love of God All those\nthings would make you draw back \u2013 affronted \u2013 and yet they are much more interesting\nthan the others nicht wahr\u2019\n\u2018I suppose\u2019 said Joan slowly \u2018that we are very reserved as a nation.\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes.",
    "One cannot even say to an Englishwoman who has recently been married\nare you going to have a baby That is one cannot say so across the table at luncheon.",
    "No\none has to take her aside to whisper it.",
    "And yet if the baby is there in its cradle you can\nsay \u201cHow is your baby\u201d\u2019\n\u2018Well \u2013 it is rather intimate isn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018No I do not see it.",
    "I met the other day a friend I have not seen for many years a\nHungarian.",
    "Mitzi I say to her you are married \u2013 yes several years now you have not a\nbaby why not She answers me she cannot think why not For five years she says she and\nher husband have tried hard \u2013 but oh how hard they have tried What she asks can she\ndo about it And since we are at a luncheon party everyone there makes a suggestion.",
    "Yes and some of them very practical.",
    "Who knows something may come of it.\u2019\nJoan looked stolidly unconvinced.",
    "Yet she felt suddenly welling up in her a strong impulse to open her own heart to this\nfriendly peculiar foreign creature.",
    "She wanted badly to share with someone the\nexperience that she had been through.",
    "She needed as it were to assure herself of its\nreality \u2026\nShe said slowly \u2018It is true \u2013 I have been through rather an upsetting experience.\u2019\n\u2018Ach yes What was it A man\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "No certainly not.\u2019\n\u2018I am glad.",
    "It is so often a man \u2013 and really in the end it becomes a little boring.\u2019\n\u2018I was all alone \u2013 at the rest house at Tell Abu Hamid \u2013 a horrible place \u2013 all flies and\ntins and rolls of barbed wire and very gloomy and dark inside.\u2019\n\u2018That is necessary because of the heat in summer but I know what you mean.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018I had no one to talk to \u2013 and I soon finished my books \u2013 and I got \u2013 I got into a very\npeculiar state.\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes that might well be so.",
    "It is interesting what you tell me.",
    "Go on.\u2019\n\u2018I began to find out things \u2013 about myself.",
    "Things that I had never known before.",
    "Or\nrather things that I had known but had never been willing to recognize.",
    "I can\u2019t quite\nexplain to you \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Oh but you can.",
    "It is quite easy.",
    "I shall understand.\u2019\nSasha\u2019s interest was so natural so unassumed that Joan found herself talking with an\nastonishing lack of self consciousness.",
    "Since to Sasha to talk of one\u2019s feelings and one\u2019s\nintimate relationships was perfectly natural it began to seem natural to Joan also.",
    "She began to talk with less hesitation describing her uneasiness her fears and her\nfinal panic.",
    "\u2018I daresay it will seem absurd to you \u2013 but I felt that I was completely lost \u2013 alone \u2013\nthat God himself had forsaken me \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Yes one has felt that \u2013 I have felt it myself.",
    "It is very dark very terrible \u2026\u2019\n\u2018It was not dark \u2013 it was light \u2013 blinding light \u2013 there was no shelter \u2013 no cover \u2013 no\nshadow.\u2019\n\u2018We mean the same thing though.",
    "For you it was light that was terrible because you\nhad hidden so long under cover and in deep shade.",
    "But for me it was darkness not seeing\nmy way being lost in the night.",
    "But the agony is the same \u2013 it is the knowledge of one\u2019s\nown nothingness and of being cut off from the love of God.\u2019\nJoan said slowly \u2018And then \u2013 it happened \u2013 like a miracle.",
    "I saw everything.",
    "Myself \u2013\nand what I had been.",
    "All my silly pretences and shams fell away.",
    "It was like \u2013 it was like\nbeing born again \u2026\u2019\nShe looked anxiously at the other woman.",
    "Sasha bent her head.",
    "\u2018And I knew what I had to do.",
    "I had to go home and start again.",
    "Build up a new life \u2026\nfrom the beginning \u2026\u2019\nThere was a silence.",
    "Sasha was looking at Joan thoughtfully and something in her\nexpression puzzled Joan.",
    "She said with a slight flush\n\u2018Oh I daresay it sounds very melodramatic and farfetched \u2013\u2019\nSasha interrupted her.",
    "\u2018No no you do not understand me.",
    "Your experience was real \u2013 it has happened to\nmany \u2013 to St Paul \u2013 to others of the Saints of God \u2013 and to ordinary mortals and sinners.",
    "It\nis conversion.",
    "It is vision.",
    "It is the soul knowing its own bitterness.",
    "Yes it is real all that \u2013\nit is as real as eating your dinner or brushing your teeth.",
    "But I wonder \u2013 all the same I\nwonder \u2026\u2019\n\u2018I feel I\u2019ve been so unkind \u2013 done harm to \u2013 to someone I love \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes you have remorse.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018And I can hardly wait to get there \u2013 to get home I mean.",
    "There is so much I want to\nsay \u2013 to tell him.\u2019\n\u2018To tell whom Your husband\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "He has been so kind \u2013 so patient always.",
    "But he has not been happy.",
    "I have not\nmade him happy.\u2019\n\u2018And you think you will be better able to make him happy now\u2019\n\u2018We can at least have an explanation.",
    "He can know how sorry I am.",
    "He can help me to\n\u2013 oh what shall I say\u2019 The words of the Communion service flashed through her mind.",
    "\u2018To lead a new life from now on.\u2019\nSasha said gravely \u2018That is what the Saints of God were able to do.\u2019\nJoan stared.",
    "\u2018But I \u2013 I am not a saint.\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "That is what I meant.\u2019 Sasha paused then said with a slight change of tone\n\u2018Forgive me that I should have said that.",
    "And perhaps it is not true.\u2019\nJoan looked slightly bewildered.",
    "Sasha lit another cigarette and began to smoke violently staring out of the window.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 said Joan uncertainly \u2018why I should tell you all this \u2013\u2019\n\u2018But naturally because you wish to tell someone \u2013 you wish to speak of it \u2013 it is in\nyour mind and you want to talk of it that is natural enough.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m usually very reserved.\u2019\nSasha looked amused.",
    "\u2018And so proud of it like all English people.",
    "Oh you are a very curious race \u2013 but very\ncurious.",
    "So shamefaced so embarrassed by your virtues so ready to admit to boast of\nyour deficiencies.\u2019\n\u2018I think you are exaggerating slightly\u2019 said Joan stiffly.",
    "She felt suddenly very British very far away from the exotic palefaced woman in the\nopposite corner of the carriage the woman to whom a minute or two previously she had\nconfided a most intimate personal experience.",
    "Joan said in a conventional voice \u2018Are you going through on the Simplon Orient\u2019\n\u2018No I stay a night in Stamboul and then I go to Vienna.\u2019 She added carelessly \u2018It is\npossible that I shall die there but perhaps not.\u2019\n\u2018Do you mean \u2013\u2019 Joan hesitated bewildered \u2018that you\u2019ve had a premonition\u2019\n\u2018Ah no\u2019 Sasha burst out laughing.",
    "\u2018No it is not like that It is an operation I am going\nto have there.",
    "A very serious operation.",
    "Not very often is it that it succeeds.",
    "But they are\ngood surgeons in Vienna.",
    "This one to whom I am going \u2013 he is very clever \u2013 a Jew.",
    "I have\nalways said it would be stupid to annihilate all the Jews in Europe.",
    "They are clever doctors\nand surgeons yes and they are clever artistically too.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Oh dear\u2019 said Joan.",
    "\u2018I am so sorry.\u2019\n\u2018Because I may be going to die But what does it matter One has to die some time.",
    "And I may not die.",
    "I have the idea if I live that I will enter a convent I know of \u2013 a very\nstrict order.",
    "One never speaks \u2013 it is perpetual meditation and prayer.\u2019\nJoan\u2019s imagination failed to conceive of a Sasha perpetually silent and meditating.",
    "Sasha went on gravely \u2018There will be much prayer needed soon \u2013 when the war\ncomes.\u2019\n\u2018War\u2019 Joan stared.",
    "Sasha nodded her head.",
    "\u2018But yes certainly war is coming.",
    "Next year or the year after.\u2019\n\u2018Really\u2019 said Joan.",
    "\u2018I think you are mistaken.\u2019\n\u2018No no.",
    "I have friends who are very well informed and they have told me so.",
    "It is all\ndecided.\u2019\n\u2018But war where \u2013 against whom\u2019\n\u2018War everywhere.",
    "Every nation will be drawn in.",
    "My friends think that Germany will\nwin quite soon but I \u2013 I do not agree.",
    "Unless they can win very very quickly indeed.",
    "You\nsee I know many English and Americans and I know what they are like.\u2019\n\u2018Surely\u2019 said Joan \u2018nobody really wants war.\u2019\nShe spoke incredulously.",
    "\u2018For what else does the Hitler Youth movement exist\u2019\nJoan said earnestly \u2018But I have friends who have been in Germany a good deal and\nthey think that there is a lot to be said for the Nazi movement.\u2019\n\u2018Oh la la\u2019 cried Sasha.",
    "\u2018See if they say that in three years\u2019 time.\u2019\nThen she leaned forward as the train drew slowly to a standstill.",
    "\u2018See we have come to the Cilician Gates.",
    "It is beautiful is it not Let us get out.\u2019\nThey got out of the train and stood looking down through the great gap in the\nmountain chain to the blue hazy plains beneath \u2026\nIt was close on sunset and the air was exquisitely cool and still.",
    "Joan thought How beautiful \u2026\nShe wished Rodney was here to see it with her.",
    "Chapter Twelve\nVictoria \u2026\nJoan felt her heart beating with sudden excitement.",
    "It was good to be home.",
    "She felt just for a moment as though she had never been away.",
    "England her own\ncountry.",
    "Nice English porters \u2026 A not so nice but very English foggy day\nNot romantic not beautiful just dear old Victoria station just the same as ever looking\njust the same smelling just the same\nOh thought Joan I\u2019m glad to be back.",
    "Such a long weary journey across Turkey and Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and Italy and\nFrance.",
    "Customs officers and passport examinations.",
    "All the different uniforms all the\ndifferent languages.",
    "She was tired \u2013 yes definitely tired \u2013 of foreigners.",
    "Even that\nextraordinary Russian woman who had travelled with her from Alep to Stamboul had got\nrather tiresome in the end.",
    "She had been interesting \u2013 indeed quite exciting \u2013 to begin\nwith simply because she was so different.",
    "But by the time they had been running down\nbeside the Sea of Marmora to Haidar Pacha Joan had been definitely looking forward to\ntheir parting.",
    "For one thing it was embarrassing to remember how freely she Joan had\ntalked about her own private affairs to a complete stranger.",
    "And for another \u2013 well it was\ndifficult to put it into words \u2013 but something about her had made Joan feel definitely\nprovincial.",
    "Not a very pleasant feeling.",
    "It had been no good to say to herself that she\nhoped she Joan was as good as anybody She didn\u2019t really think so.",
    "She felt uneasily\nconscious that Sasha for all her friendliness was an aristocrat whilst she herself was\nmiddle class the unimportant wife of a country solicitor.",
    "Very stupid of course to feel\nlike that \u2026\nBut anyway all that was over now.",
    "She was home again back on her native soil.",
    "There was no one to meet her for she had sent no further wire to Rodney to tell him\nwhen she was arriving.",
    "She had had a strong feeling that she wanted to meet Rodney in their own house.",
    "She\nwanted to be able to start straight away on her confession without pause or delay.",
    "It would\nbe easier so she thought.",
    "You couldn\u2019t very well ask a surprised husband for forgiveness on the platform at\nVictoria\nCertainly not on the arrival platform with its hurrying mob of people and the\nCustoms sheds at the end.",
    "No she would spend the night quietly at the Grosvenor and go down to Crayminster\ntomorrow.",
    "Should she she wondered try and see Averil first She could ring Averil up from the\nhotel.",
    "Yes she decided.",
    "She might do that.",
    "She had only hand luggage with her and as it had already been examined at Dover she\nwas able to go with her porter straight to the hotel.",
    "She had a bath and dressed and then rang up Averil.",
    "Fortunately Averil was at home.",
    "\u2018Mother I\u2019d no idea you were back.\u2019\n\u2018I arrived this afternoon.\u2019\n\u2018Is Father up in London\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "I didn\u2019t tell him when I was arriving.",
    "He might have come up to meet me \u2013 and\nthat would be a pity if he\u2019s busy \u2013 tiring for him.\u2019\nShe thought that she heard a faint note of surprise in Averil\u2019s voice as she said\n\u2018Yes \u2013 I think you were right.",
    "He\u2019s been very busy lately.\u2019\n\u2018Have you seen much of him\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "He was up in London for the day about three weeks ago and we had lunch\ntogether.",
    "What about this evening Mother Would you like to come out and have dinner\nsomewhere\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d rather you came here darling if you don\u2019t mind.",
    "I\u2019m a little tired with travelling.\u2019\n\u2018I expect you must be.",
    "All right I\u2019ll come round.\u2019\n\u2018Won\u2019t Edward come with you\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s got a business dinner tonight.\u2019\nJoan put down the receiver.",
    "Her heart was beating a little faster than usual.",
    "She\nthought Averil \u2013 my Averil \u2026\nHow cool and liquid Averil\u2019s voice was \u2026 calm detached impersonal.",
    "Half an hour later they telephoned up that Mrs HarrisonWilmott was there and Joan\nwent down.",
    "Mother and daughter greeted each other with English reserve.",
    "Averil looked well Joan\nthought.",
    "She was not quite so thin.",
    "Joan felt a faint thrill of pride as she went with her\ndaughter into the diningroom.",
    "Averil was really very lovely so delicate and distinguished\nlooking.",
    "They sat down at a table and Joan got a momentary shock as she met her daughter\u2019s\neyes.",
    "They were so cool and uninterested \u2026\nAveril like Victoria Station had not changed.",
    "It\u2019s I who have changed thought Joan but Averil doesn\u2019t know that.",
    "Averil asked about Barbara and about Baghdad.",
    "Joan recounted various incidents of\n\n\fher journey home.",
    "Somehow or other their talk was rather difficult.",
    "It did not seem to\nflow.",
    "Averil\u2019s inquiries after Barbara were almost perfunctory.",
    "It really seemed as though\nshe had an inkling that more pertinent questions might be indiscreet.",
    "But Averil couldn\u2019t\nknow anything of the truth.",
    "It was just her usual delicate incurious attitude.",
    "The truth Joan thought suddenly how do I know it is the truth Mightn\u2019t it just\npossibly be all imagination on her part After all there was no concrete evidence \u2026\nShe rejected the idea but the mere passing of it through her head had given her a\nshock.",
    "Supposing she was one of those people who imagined things \u2026\nAveril was saying in her cool voice \u2018Edward has got it into his head that there\u2019s bound\nto be war with Germany one day.\u2019\nJoan roused herself.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s what a woman on the train said.",
    "She seemed quite certain about it.",
    "She was\nrather an important person and she really seemed to know what she was talking about.",
    "I\ncan\u2019t believe it.",
    "Hitler would never dare to go to war.\u2019\nAveril said thoughtfully \u2018Oh I don\u2019t know \u2026\u2019\n\u2018Nobody wants war darling.\u2019\n\u2018Well people sometimes get what they don\u2019t want.\u2019\nJoan said decidedly \u2018I think all this talk of it is very dangerous.",
    "It puts ideas into\npeople\u2019s heads.\u2019\nAveril smiled.",
    "They continued to talk in rather a desultory fashion.",
    "After dinner Joan yawned and\nAveril said she wouldn\u2019t stay and keep her up \u2013 she must be tired.",
    "Joan said Yes she was rather tired.",
    "On the following day Joan did a little shopping in the morning and caught the 2.30\ntrain to Crayminster.",
    "That would get her there just after four o\u2019clock.",
    "She would be\nwaiting for Rodney when he came home at tea time from the office \u2026\nShe looked out of the carriage window with appreciation.",
    "Nothing much in the way of\nscenery to see this time of year \u2013 bare trees a faint misty rain falling \u2013 but how natural\nhow homelike.",
    "Baghdad with its crowded bazaars its brilliant blue domed and golden\nmosques was far away \u2013 unreal \u2013 it might never have happened.",
    "That long fantastic\njourney the plains of Anatolia the snows and mountain scenery of the Taurus the high\nbare plains \u2013 the long descent through mountain gorges to the Bosphorus Stamboul with\nits minarets the funny ox wagons of the Balkans \u2013 Italy with the blue Adriatic Sea\nglistening as they left Trieste \u2013 Switzerland and the Alps in the darkening light \u2013 a\npanorama of different sights and scenes \u2013 and all ending in this \u2013 this journey home\nthrough the quiet winter countryside \u2026\nI might never have been away thought Joan.",
    "I might never have been away \u2026\nShe felt confused unable to coordinate her thoughts clearly.",
    "Seeing Averil last night\nhad upset her \u2013 Averil\u2019s cool eyes looking at her calm incurious.",
    "Averil she thought\n\n\fhadn\u2019t seen any difference in her.",
    "Well after all why should Averil see a difference\nIt wasn\u2019t her physical appearance that had changed.",
    "She said very softly to herself \u2018Rodney \u2026\u2019\nThe glow came back \u2013 the sorrow \u2013 the yearning for love and forgiveness \u2026\nShe thought It\u2019s all true \u2026 I am beginning a new life \u2026\nShe took a taxi up from the station.",
    "Agnes opened the door and displayed a flattering\nsurprise and pleasure.",
    "The Master Agnes said would be pleased.",
    "Joan went up to her bedroom took off her hat and came down again.",
    "The room\nlooked a little bare but that was because it had no flowers in it.",
    "I must cut some laurel tomorrow she thought and get some carnations from the shop\nat the corner.",
    "She walked about the room feeling nervous and excited.",
    "Should she tell Rodney what she had guessed about Barbara Supposing that after all\n\u2013\nOf course it wasn\u2019t true She had imagined the whole thing.",
    "Imagined it all because of\nwhat that stupid woman Blanche Haggard \u2013 no Blanche Donovan \u2013 had said.",
    "Really\nBlanche had looked too terrible \u2013 so old and coarse.",
    "Joan put her hand to her head.",
    "She felt as though within her brain was a kaleidoscope.",
    "She had had a kaleidoscope as a child and loved it had held her breath as all the coloured\npieces whirled and revolved before settling down into a pattern \u2026\nWhat had been the matter with her\nThat horrible rest house place and that very odd experience she had had in the desert\n\u2026 She had imagined all sorts of unpleasant things \u2013 that her children didn\u2019t like her \u2013 that\nRodney had loved Leslie Sherston of course he hadn\u2019t \u2013 what an idea Poor Leslie.",
    "And\nshe had even been regretful because she had persuaded Rodney out of that extraordinary\nfancy of his to take up farming.",
    "Really she had been very sensible and farseeing \u2026\nOh dear why was she so confused All those things she had been thinking and\nbelieving \u2013 such unpleasant things \u2026\nWere they actually true Or weren\u2019t they She didn\u2019t want them to be true.",
    "She\u2019d got to decide \u2013 she\u2019d got to decide \u2026\nWhat had she got to decide\nThe sun \u2013 thought Joan \u2013 the sun was very hot.",
    "The sun does give you\nhallucinations \u2026\nRunning in the desert \u2026 falling on her hands and knees \u2026 praying \u2026\nWas that real\nOr was this\n\n\fMadness \u2013 absolute madness the things she had been believing.",
    "How comfortable\nhow pleasant to come home to England and feel you had never been away.",
    "That\neverything was just the same as you had always thought it was \u2026\nAnd of course everything was just the same.",
    "A kaleidoscope whirling \u2026 whirling \u2026\nSettling presently into one pattern or the other.",
    "Rodney forgive me \u2013 I didn\u2019t know \u2026\nRodney here I am.",

    "She heard the sound of the front door opening \u2013 a sound she knew so well \u2013 so very\nwell \u2026\nRodney was coming.",
    "Which pattern Which pattern Quick\nThe door opened.",
    "Rodney came in.",
    "He stopped surprised.",
    "Joan came quickly forward.",
    "She didn\u2019t look at once at his face.",
    "Give him a moment\nshe thought give him a moment\u2026\nThen she said gaily \u2018Here I am Rodney \u2026 I\u2019ve come home \u2026\u2019\n\n\fEpilogue\nRodney Scudamore sat in the small lowbacked chair while his wife poured out tea and\nclanked the teaspoons and chattered brightly about how nice it was to be home again and\nhow delightful it was to find everything exactly the same and that Rodney wouldn\u2019t\nbelieve how wonderful it was to be back in England again and back in Crayminster and\nback in her own home\nOn the windowpane a big bluebottle deceived by the unusual warmth of the early\nNovember day buzzed importantly up and down the glass.",
    "Buzz buzz buzz went the bluebottle.",
    "Tinkle tinkle tinkle went Joan Scudamore\u2019s voice.",
    "Rodney sat smiling and nodding his head.",
    "Noises he thought noises \u2026\nMeaning everything to some people and nothing at all to others.",
    "He had been mistaken he decided in thinking that there was something wrong with\nJoan when she first arrived.",
    "There was nothing wrong with Joan.",
    "She was just the same as\nusual.",
    "Everything was just the same as usual.",
    "Presently Joan went upstairs to see to her unpacking and Rodney went across the hall\nto his study where he had brought some work home from the office.",
    "But first he unlocked the small top righthand drawer of his desk and took out\nBarbara\u2019s letter.",
    "It had come by Air Mail and had been sent off a few days before Joan\u2019s\ndeparture from Baghdad.",
    "It was a long closely written letter and he knew it now almost by heart.",
    "Nevertheless\nhe read it through again dwelling a little on the last page.",
    "\u2013 So now I have told you everything darling Dads.",
    "I daresay you guessed most of\nit already.",
    "You needn\u2019t worry about me.",
    "I do realize just what a criminal wicked\nlittle fool I have been.",
    "Remember Mother knows nothing.",
    "It wasn\u2019t too easy\nkeeping it all from her but Dr McQueen played up like a trump and William was\nwonderful.",
    "I really don\u2019t know what I should have done without him \u2013 he was\nalways there ready to fend Mother off if things got difficult.",
    "I felt pretty desperate\nwhen she wired she was coming out.",
    "I know you must have tried to stop her\ndarling and that she just wouldn\u2019t be stopped \u2013 and I suppose it was really rather\nsweet of her in a way \u2013 only of course she had to rearrange our whole lives for us\nand it was simply maddening and I felt too weak to struggle much I\u2019m only just\nbeginning to feel that Mopsy is my own again She is sweet.",
    "I wish you could see\nher.",
    "Did you like us when we were babies or only later Darling Dads I\u2019m so glad\nI had you for a father.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about me.",
    "I\u2019m all right now.",
    "Your loving Babs.",
    "Rodney hesitated a moment holding the letter.",
    "He would have liked to have kept it.",
    "It\nmeant a great deal to him \u2013 that written declaration of his daughter\u2019s faith and trust in him.",
    "But in the exercise of his profession he had seen only too often the dangers of kept\nletters.",
    "If he were to die suddenly Joan would go through his papers and come across it\nand it would cause her needless pain.",
    "No need for her to be hurt and dismayed.",
    "Let her\nremain happy and secure in the bright confident world that she had made for herself.",
    "He went across the room and dropped Barbara\u2019s letter into the fire.",
    "Yes he thought\nshe would be all right now.",
    "They would all be all right.",
    "It was for Barbara he had feared\nmost \u2013 with her unbalanced deeply emotional temperament.",
    "Well the crisis had come and\nshe had escaped not unscathed but alive.",
    "And already she was realizing that Mopsy and\nBill were truly her world.",
    "A good fellow Bill Wray.",
    "Rodney hoped that he hadn\u2019t suffered\ntoo much.",
    "Yes Barbara would be all right.",
    "And Tony was all right in his orange groves in\nRhodesia \u2013 a long way away but all right \u2013 and that young wife of his sounded the right\nkind of girl.",
    "Nothing had ever hurt Tony much \u2013 perhaps it never would.",
    "He had that\nsunny type of mind.",
    "And Averil was all right too.",
    "As always when he thought of Averil it was pride he\nfelt not pity.",
    "Averil with her dry legal mind and her passion for understatement.",
    "Averil\nwith her cool sarcastic tongue.",
    "So rocklike so staunch so strangely unlike the name they\nhad given her.",
    "He had fought Averil fought her and vanquished her with the only weapons her\ndisdainful mind would recognize weapons that he himself had found it distasteful to use.",
    "Cold reasons logical reasons pitiless reasons \u2013 she had accepted those.",
    "But had she forgiven him He thought not.",
    "But it didn\u2019t matter.",
    "If he had destroyed her\nlove for him he had retained and enhanced her respect \u2013 and in the end he thought to a\nmind like hers and to her flawless rectitude it is respect that counts.",
    "On the eve of her wedding day speaking to his bestloved child across the great gulf\nthat now separated them he had said\n\u2018I hope you will be happy.\u2019\nAnd she had answered quietly \u2018I shall try to be happy.\u2019\nThat was Averil \u2013 no heroics no dwelling on the past \u2013 no selfpity.",
    "A disciplined\nacceptance of life \u2013 and the ability to live it without help from others.",
    "He thought They\u2019re out of my hands now the three of them.",
    "Rodney pushed back the papers on his desk and came over to sit in the chair on the\nright of the fireplace.",
    "He took with him the Massingham lease and sighing slightly started\nto read it over.",
    "\u2018The Landlord lets and the tenant takes all that farmhouse buildings lands and\nhereditaments situate at \u2026\u2019 He read on and turned the page.",
    "\u2018not to take more than\ntwo white straw crops of corn from any part of the arable lands without a summer\nfallow a crop of turnips and rape sown on land well cleaned and manured and\n\n\featen on such land with sheep to be considered equivalent to a fallow and \u2026\u2019\nHis hand relaxed and his eyes wandered to the empty chair opposite.",
    "That was where Leslie had sat when he argued with her about the children and the\nundesirability of their coming in contact with Sherston.",
    "She ought he had said to consider\nthe children.",
    "She had considered them she said \u2013 and after all he was their father.",
    "A father who had been in prison he said \u2013 an exjailbird \u2013 public opinion \u2013 ostracism\n\u2013 cutting them off from their normal social existence \u2013 penalizing them unfairly.",
    "She\nought he said to think of all that.",
    "Children he said should not have their youth clouded.",
    "They should start fair.",
    "And she had said \u2018That\u2019s just it.",
    "He is their father.",
    "It isn\u2019t so much that they belong to\nhim as that he belongs to them.",
    "I can wish of course that they\u2019d had a different kind of\nfather \u2013 but it isn\u2019t so.\u2019\nAnd she had said \u2018What kind of a start in life would it be \u2013 to begin by running away\nfrom what\u2019s there\u2019\nWell he saw her idea of course.",
    "But it didn\u2019t agree with his ideas.",
    "He\u2019d always\nwanted to give his children the best of things \u2013 indeed that was what he and Joan had\ndone.",
    "The best schools the sunniest rooms in the house \u2013 they\u2019d practised small\neconomies themselves to make that possible.",
    "But in their case there had never been any moral problem.",
    "There had been no disgrace\nno dark shadow no failure despair and anguish no question of that kind when it would\nhave been necessary to say \u2018Shall we shield them Or let them share\u2019\nAnd it was Leslie\u2019s idea he saw that they should share.",
    "She although she loved them\nwould not shrink from placing a portion of her burden on those small untrained backs.",
    "Not selfishly not to ease her own load but because she did not want to deny them even\nthe smallest most unendurable part of reality.",
    "Well he thought that she was wrong.",
    "But he admitted as he had always admitted her\ncourage.",
    "It went beyond courage for herself.",
    "She had courage for those she loved.",
    "She remembered Joan saying that autumn day as he went to the office\n\u2018Courage Oh yes but courage isn\u2019t everything\u2019\nAnd he had said \u2018Isn\u2019t it\u2019\nLeslie sitting there in his chair with her left eyebrow going slightly up and her right\neyebrow down and with the little twist at the righthand corner of her mouth and her head\nagainst the faded blue cushion that made her hair look \u2013 somehow \u2013 green.",
    "He remembered his voice slightly surprised saying\n\u2018Your hair\u2019s not brown.",
    "It\u2019s green.\u2019\nIt was the only personal thing he\u2019d ever said to her.",
    "He\u2019d never thought very much\nwhat she looked like.",
    "Tired he knew and ill \u2013 and yet withal strong \u2013 yes physically\nstrong.",
    "He had thought once incongruously She could sling a sack of potatoes over her\n\n\fshoulder just like a man.",
    "Not a very romantic thought and there wasn\u2019t really anything very romantic that he\ncould remember about her.",
    "The right shoulder higher than the left the left eyebrow going\nup and the right down the little twist at the corner of her mouth when she smiled the\nbrown hair that looked green against a faded blue cushion.",
    "Not much he thought for love to feed on.",
    "And what was love In Heaven\u2019s name\nwhat was love The peace and content that he\u2019d felt to see her sitting there in his chair\nher head green against the blue cushion.",
    "The way she had said suddenly \u2018You know I\u2019ve\nbeen thinking about Copernicus \u2013\u2019\nCopernicus Why in Heaven\u2019s name Copernicus A monk with an idea \u2013 with a vision\nof a differently shaped world \u2013 and who was cunning and adroit enough to compromise\nwith the powers of the world and to write his faith in such a form as would pass muster.",
    "Why should Leslie with her husband in prison and her living to earn and her children\nto worry about sit there running a hand through her hair and say \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking\nabout Copernicus\u2019\nYet because of that for always at the mention of Copernicus his own heart would\nmiss a beat and up there on the wall he had hung an old engraving of the monk to say to\nhim \u2018Leslie.\u2019\nHe thought I should at least have told her that I loved her.",
    "I might have said so \u2013 once.",
    "But had there been any need That day on Asheldown \u2013 sitting there in the October\nsunlight.",
    "He and she together \u2013 together and apart.",
    "The agony and the desperate longing.",
    "Four feet of space between them \u2013 four feet because there couldn\u2019t safely be less.",
    "She had\nunderstood that.",
    "She must have understood that.",
    "He thought confusedly That space\nbetween us \u2013 like an electric field \u2013 charged with longing.",
    "They had not looked at each other.",
    "He had looked down over the ploughland and the\nfarm with the distant faint sound of the tractor and the pale purple of the upturned earth.",
    "And Leslie had looked beyond the farmland to the woods.",
    "Like two people gazing at a promised land to which they could not enter in.",
    "He\nthought I should have told her that I loved her then.",
    "But neither of them had said anything \u2013 except just that once when Leslie had\nmurmured \u2018And thy eternal summer shall not fade.\u2019\nJust that.",
    "One hackneyed line of quotation.",
    "And he didn\u2019t even know what she had\nmeant by it.",
    "Or perhaps he did.",
    "Yes perhaps he did.",
    "The chair cushion had faded.",
    "And Leslie\u2019s face.",
    "He couldn\u2019t remember her face\nclearly only that queer twist of the mouth.",
    "And yet for the last six weeks she had sat there every day and talked to him.",
    "Just\nfantasy of course.",
    "He had invented a pseudo Leslie and put her there in the chair and put\nwords into her mouth.",
    "He had made her say what he wanted her to say and she had been\nobedient but her mouth had curved upwards at the side as though she had laughed at what\n\n\fhe was doing to her.",
    "It had been he thought a very happy six weeks.",
    "He\u2019d been able to see Watkins and\nMills and there had been that jolly evening with Hargrave Taylor \u2013 just a few friends and\nnot too many of them.",
    "That pleasant tramp across the hills on Sunday.",
    "The servants had\ngiven him very good meals and he\u2019d eaten them as slowly as he liked with a book\npropped up against the soda water syphon.",
    "Some work to finish sometimes after dinner\nand then a pipe and finally just in case he might feel lonely false Leslie arranged in her\nchair to keep him company.",
    "False Leslie yes but hadn\u2019t there been somewhere not very far away real Leslie\nAnd thy eternal summer shall not fade.",
    "He looked down again at the lease.",
    "\u2018\u2026 and shall in all respects cultivate the said farm in due and regular course of\ngood husbandry.\u2019\nHe thought wonderingly I\u2019m really quite a good lawyer.",
    "And then without wonder and without much interest \u2018I\u2019m successful.\u2019\nFarming he thought was a difficult heartbreaking business.",
    "\u2018My God though\u2019 he thought \u2018I\u2019m tired.\u2019\nHe hadn\u2019t felt so tired for a long time.",
    "The door opened and Joan came in.",
    "\u2018Oh Rodney \u2013 you can\u2019t read that without the light on.\u2019\nShe rustled across behind him and turned the light on.",
    "He smiled and thanked her.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re so stupid darling to sit here ruining your eyes when all you\u2019ve got to do is\njust to turn a switch.\u2019\nShe added affectionately as she sat down \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d do without me.\u2019\n\u2018Get into all sort of bad habits.\u2019\nHis smile was teasing kindly.",
    "\u2018Do you remember\u2019 Joan went on \u2018when you suddenly got an idea you wanted to turn\ndown Uncle Henry\u2019s offer and take up farming instead\u2019\n\u2018Yes I remember.\u2019\n\u2018Aren\u2019t you glad now I wouldn\u2019t let you\u2019\nHe looked at her admiring her eager competence the youthful poise of her neck her\nsmooth pretty unlined face.",
    "Cheerful confident affectionate.",
    "He thought Joan\u2019s been a\nvery good wife to me.",
    "He said quietly \u2018Yes I\u2019m glad.\u2019\nJoan said \u2018We all get impractical ideas sometimes.\u2019\n\u2018Even you\u2019\n\n\fHe said it teasingly but was surprised to see her frown.",
    "An expression passed over her\nface like a ripple across smooth water.",
    "\u2018One gets nervy sometimes \u2013 morbid.\u2019\nHe was still more surprised.",
    "He could not imagine Joan nervy or morbid.",
    "Changing the\nsubject he said\n\u2018You know I quite envy you your journey out East.\u2019\n\u2018Yes it was interesting.",
    "But I shouldn\u2019t like to have to live in a place like Baghdad.\u2019\nRodney said thoughtfully \u2018I\u2019d like to know what the desert is like.",
    "It must be rather\nwonderful \u2013 emptiness and a clear strong light.",
    "It\u2019s the idea of the light that fascinates me.",
    "To see clearly \u2013\u2019\nJoan interrupted him.",
    "She said vehemently \u2018It\u2019s hateful \u2013 hateful \u2013 just arid\nnothingness\u2019\nShe looked round the room with a sharp nervous glance.",
    "Rather he thought like an\nanimal that wants to escape.",
    "Her brow cleared.",
    "She said \u2018That cushion\u2019s dreadfully old and faded.",
    "I must get a new\none for that chair.\u2019\nHe made a sharp instinctive gesture then checked himself.",
    "After all why not A cushion was faded.",
    "Leslie Adeline Sherston was in the\nchurchyard under a marble slab.",
    "The firm of Alderman Scudamore and Witney was\nforging ahead.",
    "Farmer Hoddesdon was trying to raise another mortgage.",
    "Joan was walking round the room testing a ledge for dust replacing a book in the\nbookshelf moving the ornaments on the mantelpiece.",
    "It was true that in the last six weeks\nthe room had acquired an untidy shabby appearance.",
    "Rodney murmured to himself softly \u2018The holidays are over.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019 she whirled round on him.",
    "\u2018What did you say\u2019\nHe blinked at her disarmingly.",
    "\u2018Did I say anything\u2019\n\u2018I thought you said \u201cthe holidays are over.\u201d You must have dropped off and been\ndreaming \u2013 about the children going back to school.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Rodney \u2018I must have been dreaming.\u2019\nShe stood looking at him doubtfully.",
    "Then she straightened a picture on the wall.",
    "\u2018What\u2019s this It\u2019s new isn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "I picked it up at Hartley\u2019s sale.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 Joan eyed it doubtfully.",
    "\u2018Copernicus Is it valuable\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve no idea\u2019 said Rodney.",
    "He repeated thoughtfully \u2018I\u2019ve no idea at all \u2026\u2019\nWhat was valuable what was not Was there such a thing as remembrance\n\u2018You know I\u2019ve been thinking about Copernicus \u2026\u2019\n\n\fLeslie with her shifty jail bird of a husband \u2013 drunkenness poverty illness death.",
    "\u2018Poor Mrs Sherston such a sad life.\u2019\nBut he thought Leslie wasn\u2019t sad.",
    "She walked through disillusionment and poverty\nand illness like a man walks through bogs and over plough and across rivers cheerfully\nand impatiently to get to wherever it is he is going \u2026\nHe looked thoughtfully at his wife out of tired but kindly eyes.",
    "So bright and efficient and busy so pleased and successful.",
    "He thought She doesn\u2019t\nlook a day over twentyeight.",
    "And suddenly a vast upwelling rush of pity swept over him.",
    "He said with intense feeling \u2018Poor little Joan.\u2019\nShe stared at him.",
    "She said \u2018Why poor And I\u2019m not little.\u2019\nHe said in his old teasing voice \u2018Here am I little Joan.",
    "If nobody\u2019s with me I\u2019m all\nalone.\u2019\nShe came to him with a sudden rush almost breathing she said\n\u2018I\u2019m not alone.",
    "I\u2019m not alone.",
    "I\u2019ve got you.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Rodney.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve got me.\u2019\nBut he knew as he said it that it wasn\u2019t true.",
    "He thought\nYou are alone and you always will be.",
    "But please God you\u2019ll never know it."
