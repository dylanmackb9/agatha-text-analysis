    "He hung\nit up with some care taking time over it.",
    "His hat went carefully on the\nnext peg.",
    "He squared his shoulders affixed a resolute smile to his face and\nwalked into the sitting room where his wife sat knitting a Balaclava\nhelmet in khaki wool.",
    "It was the spring of 1940.",
    "Mrs. Beresford gave him a quick glance and then busied herself by\nknitting at a furious rate.",
    "She said after a minute or two\n\u201cAny news in the evening paper\u201d\nTommy said\n\u201cThe Blitzkrieg is coming hurray hurray Things look bad in\nFrance.\u201d\nTuppence said\n\u201cIt\u2019s a depressing world at the moment.\u201d\nThere was a pause and then Tommy said\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you ask No need to be so damned tactful.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u201d admitted Tuppence.",
    "\u201cThere is something about conscious\ntact that is very irritating.",
    "But then it irritates you if I do ask.",
    "And\nanyway I don\u2019t need to ask.",
    "It\u2019s written all over you.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t conscious of looking a Dismal Desmond.\u201d\n\u201cNo darling\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cYou had a kind of nailed to the mast\nsmile which was one of the most heartrending things I have ever seen.\u201d\nTommy said with a grin\n\u201cNo was it really as bad as all that\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd more Well come on out with it.",
    "Nothing doing\u201d\n\u201cNothing doing.",
    "They don\u2019t want me in any capacity.",
    "I tell you\nTuppence it\u2019s pretty thick when a man of fortysix is made to feel like a\ndoddering grandfather.",

    "I may be required later.\u201d\nTuppence said\n\u201cWell it\u2019s the same for me.",
    "They don\u2019t want people of my age for\nnursing\u2014no thank you.",
    "Nor for anything else.",
    "They\u2019d rather have a\nfluffy chit who\u2019s never seen a wound or sterilised a dressing than they\nwould have me who worked for three years 1915 to 1918 in various\ncapacities nurse in the surgical ward and operating theatre driver of a\ntrade delivery van and later of a General.",
    "This that and the other\u2014all I\nassert firmly with conspicuous success.",
    "And now I\u2019m a poor pushing\ntiresome middleaged woman who won\u2019t sit at home quietly and knit as\nshe ought to do.\u201d\nTommy said gloomily\n\u201cThis war is hell.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough having a war\u201d said Tuppence \u201cbut not being\nallowed to do anything in it just puts the lid on.\u201d\nTommy said consolingly\n\u201cWell at any rate Deborah has got a job.\u201d\nDeborah\u2019s mother said\n\u201cOh she\u2019s all right.",
    "I expect she\u2019s good at it too.",
    "But I still think\nTommy that I could hold my own with Deborah.\u201d\nTommy grinned.",
    "\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t think so.\u201d\nTuppence said\n\u201cDaughters can be very trying.",
    "Especially when they will be so kind\nto you.\u201d\nTommy murmured\n\u201cThe way young Derek makes allowances for me is sometimes rather\nhard to bear.",
    "That \u2018poor old Dad\u2019 look in his eye.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact\u201d said Tuppence \u201cour children although quite adorable are\nalso quite maddening.\u201d\n\n\fBut at the mention of the twins Derek and Deborah her eyes were\nvery tender.",
    "\u201cI suppose\u201d said Tommy thoughtfully \u201cthat it\u2019s always hard for\npeople themselves to realise that they\u2019re getting middleaged and past\ndoing things.\u201d\nTuppence gave a snort of rage tossed her glossy dark head and sent\nher ball of khaki wool spinning from her lap.",
    "\u201cAre we past doing things Are we Or is it only that everyone keeps\ninsinuating that we are.",
    "Sometimes I feel that we never were any use.\u201d\n\u201cQuite likely\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cPerhaps so.",
    "But at any rate we did once feel important.",
    "And now\nI\u2019m beginning to feel that all that never really happened.",
    "Did it happen\nTommy Is it true that you were once crashed on the head and kidnapped\nby German agents Is it true that we once tracked down a dangerous\ncriminal\u2014and got him Is it true that we rescued a girl and got hold of\nimportant secret papers and were practically thanked by a grateful\ncountry Us You and me Despised unwanted Mr. and Mrs. Beresford.\u201d\n\u201cNow dry up darling.",
    "All this does no good.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same\u201d said Tuppence blinking back a tear \u201cI\u2019m\ndisappointed in our Mr. Carter.\u201d\n\u201cHe wrote us a very nice letter.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything\u2014he didn\u2019t even hold out any hope.\u201d\n\u201cWell he\u2019s out of it all nowadays.",
    "Like us.",
    "He\u2019s quite old.",
    "Lives in\nScotland and fishes.\u201d\nTuppence said wistfully\n\u201cThey might have let us do something in the Intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps we couldn\u2019t\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cPerhaps nowadays we\nwouldn\u2019t have the nerve.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cOne feels just the same.",
    "But perhaps as\nyou say when it came to the point\u2014\u201d\nShe sighed.",
    "She said\n\u201cI wish we could find a job of some kind.",
    "It\u2019s so rotten when one has\nso much time to think.\u201d\nHer eyes rested just for a minute on the photograph of the very young\nman in the Air Force uniform with the wide grinning smile so like\n\n\fTommy\u2019s.",
    "Tommy said\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse for a man.",
    "Women can knit after all\u2014and do up parcels\nand help at canteens.\u201d\nTuppence said\n\u201cI can do all that twenty years from now.",
    "I\u2019m not old enough to be\ncontent with that.",
    "I\u2019m neither one thing nor the other.\u201d\nThe front door bell rang.",
    "Tuppence got up.",
    "The flat was a small\nservice one.",
    "She opened the door to find a broadshouldered man with a big fair\nmoustache and a cheerful red face standing on the mat.",
    "His glance a quick one took her in as he asked in a pleasant voice\n\u201cAre you Mrs. Beresford\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Grant.",
    "I\u2019m a friend of Lord Easthampton\u2019s.",
    "He\nsuggested I should look you and your husband up.\u201d\n\u201cOh how nice do come in.\u201d\nShe preceded him into the sitting room.",
    "\u201cMy husband er\u2014Captain\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMr.\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Grant.",
    "He\u2019s a friend of Mr. Car\u2014of Lord Easthampton\u2019s.\u201d\nThe old nom de guerre of the former Chief of the Intelligence \u201cMr.",
    "Carter\u201d always came more easily to her lips than their old friend\u2019s\nproper title.",
    "For a few minutes the three talked happily together.",
    "Grant was an\nattractive person with an easy manner.",
    "Presently Tuppence left the room.",
    "She returned a few minutes later\nwith the sherry and some glasses.",
    "After a few minutes when a pause came Mr. Grant said to Tommy\n\u201cI hear you\u2019re looking for a job Beresford\u201d\nAn eager light came into Tommy\u2019s eye.",
    "\u201cYes indeed.",
    "You don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\nGrant laughed and shook his head.",
    "\u201cOh nothing of that kind.",
    "No I\u2019m afraid that has to be left to the\nyoung active men\u2014or to those who\u2019ve been at it for years.",
    "The only\n\n\fthings I can suggest are rather stodgy I\u2019m afraid.",
    "Office work.",
    "Filing\npapers.",
    "Tying them up in red tape and pigeonholing them.",
    "That sort of\nthing.\u201d\nTommy\u2019s face fell.",
    "\u201cOh I see\u201d\nGrant said encouragingly\n\u201cOh well it\u2019s better than nothing.",
    "Anyway come and see me at my\noffice one day.",
    "Ministry of Requirements.",
    "Room 22.",
    "We\u2019ll fix you up\nwith something.\u201d\nThe telephone rang.",
    "Tuppence picked up the receiver.",
    "\u201cHallo\u2014yes\u2014what\u201d A squeaky voice spoke agitatedly from the\nother end.",
    "Tuppence\u2019s face changed.",
    "\u201cWhen\u2014Oh my dear\u2014of course\n\u2014I\u2019ll come over right away.",
    ". . .\u201d\nShe put back the receiver.",
    "She said to Tommy\n\u201cThat was Maureen.\u201d\n\u201cI thought so\u2014I recognised her voice from here.\u201d\nTuppence explained breathlessly\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr. Grant.",
    "But I must go round to this friend of mine.",
    "She\u2019s fallen and twisted her ankle and there\u2019s no one with her but her\nlittle girl so I must go round and fix up things for her and get hold of\nsomeone to come in and look after her.",
    "Do forgive me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course Mrs. Beresford.",
    "I quite understand.\u201d\nTuppence smiled at him picked up a coat which had been lying over\nthe sofa slipped her arms into it and hurried out.",
    "The flat door banged.",
    "Tommy poured out another glass of sherry for his guest.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t go yet\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThank you.\u201d The other accepted the glass.",
    "He sipped it for a\nmoment in silence.",
    "Then he said \u201cIn a way you know your wife\u2019s being\ncalled away is a fortunate occurrence.",
    "It will save time.\u201d\nTommy stared.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nGrant said deliberately\n\u201cYou see Beresford if you had come to see me at the Ministry I was\nempowered to put a certain proposition before you.\u201d\n\n\fThe colour came slowly up in Tommy\u2019s freckled face.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\nGrant nodded.",
    "\u201cEasthampton suggested you\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHe told us you were the man\nfor the job.\u201d\nTommy gave a deep sigh.",
    "\u201cTell me\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis is strictly confidential of course.\u201d\nTommy nodded.",
    "\u201cNot even your wife must know.",
    "You understand\u201d\n\u201cVery well\u2014if you say so.",
    "But we worked together before.\u201d\n\u201cYes I know.",
    "But this proposition is solely for you.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "All right.\u201d\n\u201cOstensibly you will be offered work\u2014as I said just now\u2014office\nwork\u2014in a branch of the Ministry functioning in Scotland\u2014in a\nprohibited area where your wife cannot accompany you.",
    "Actually you\nwill be somewhere very different.\u201d\nTommy merely waited.",
    "Grant said\n\u201cYou\u2019ve read in the newspapers of the Fifth Column You know\nroughly at any rate just what that term implies.\u201d\nTommy murmured\n\u201cThe enemy within.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "This war Beresford started in an optimistic spirit.",
    "Oh I\ndon\u2019t mean the people who really knew\u2014we\u2019ve known all along what\nwe were up against\u2014the efficiency of the enemy his aerial strength his\ndeadly determination and the coordination of his wellplanned war\nmachine.",
    "I mean the people as a whole.",
    "The goodhearted\nmuddleheaded democratic fellow who believes what he wants to believe\n\u2014that Germany will crack up that she\u2019s on the verge of revolution that\nher weapons of war are made of tin and that her men are so underfed\nthat they\u2019ll fall down if they try to march\u2014all that sort of stuff.",
    "Wishful\nthinking as the saying goes.",
    "\u201cWell the war didn\u2019t go that way.",
    "It started badly and it went on\nworse.",
    "The men were all right\u2014the men on the battleships and in the\n\n\fplanes and in the dugouts.",
    "But there was mismanagement and\nunpreparedness\u2014the defects perhaps of our qualities.",
    "We don\u2019t want\nwar haven\u2019t considered it seriously weren\u2019t good at preparing for it.",
    "\u201cThe worst of that is over.",
    "We\u2019ve corrected our mistakes we\u2019re\nslowly getting the right men in the right place.",
    "We\u2019re beginning to run\nthe war as it should be run\u2014and we can win the war\u2014make no mistake\nabout that\u2014but only if we don\u2019t lose it first.",
    "And the danger of losing it\ncomes not from outside\u2014not from the might of Germany\u2019s bombers not\nfrom her seizure of neutral countries and fresh vantage points from\nwhich to attack\u2014but from within.",
    "Our danger is the danger of Troy\u2014the\nwooden horse within our walls.",
    "Call it the Fifth Column if you like.",
    "It is\nhere among us.",
    "Men and women some of them highly placed some of\nthem obscure but all believing genuinely in the Nazi aims and the Nazi\ncreed and desiring to substitute that sternly efficient creed for the\nmuddled easygoing liberty of our democratic institutions.\u201d\nGrant leant forward.",
    "He said still in that same pleasant unemotional\nvoice\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t know who they are . . .\u201d\nTommy said \u201cBut surely\u2014\u201d\nGrant said with a touch of impatience\n\u201cOh we can round up the small fry.",
    "That\u2019s easy enough.",
    "But it\u2019s the\nothers.",
    "We know about them.",
    "We know that there are at least two highly\nplaced in the Admiralty\u2014that one must be a member of General G\n\u2014\u2014\u2019s staff\u2014that there are three or more in the Air Force and that two\nat least are members of the Intelligence and have access to Cabinet\nsecrets.",
    "We know that because it must be so from the way things have\nhappened.",
    "The leakage\u2014a leakage from the top\u2014of information to the\nenemy shows us that.\u201d\nTommy said helplessly his pleasant face perplexed\n\u201cBut what good should I be to you I don\u2019t know any of these\npeople.\u201d\nGrant nodded.",
    "\u201cExactly.",
    "You don\u2019t know any of them\u2014and they don\u2019t know you.\u201d\nHe paused to let it sink in and then went on\n\n\f\u201cThese people these highup people know most of our lot.",
    "Information can\u2019t be very well refused to them.",
    "I am at my wits\u2019 end.",
    "I\nwent to Easthampton.",
    "He\u2019s out of it all now\u2014a sick man\u2014but his brain\u2019s\nthe best I\u2019ve ever known.",
    "He thought of you.",
    "Over twenty years since\nyou worked for the department.",
    "Name quite unconnected with it.",
    "Your\nface not known.",
    "What do you say\u2014will you take it on\u201d\nTommy\u2019s face was almost split in two by the magnitude of his\necstatic grin.",
    "\u201cTake it on You bet I\u2019ll take it on.",
    "Though I can\u2019t see how I can be\nof any use.",
    "I\u2019m just a blasted amateur.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Beresford amateur status is just what is needed.",
    "The\nprofessional is handicapped here.",
    "You\u2019ll take the place of the best man\nwe had or are likely to have.\u201d\nTommy looked a question.",
    "Grant nodded.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Died in St. Bridget\u2019s Hospital last Tuesday.",
    "Run down by a\nlorry\u2014only lived a few hours.",
    "Accident case\u2014but it wasn\u2019t an\naccident.\u201d\nTommy said slowly \u201cI see.\u201d\nGrant said quietly\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have reason to believe that Farquhar was on to\nsomething\u2014that he was getting somewhere at last.",
    "By his death that\nwasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d\nTommy looked a question.",
    "Grant went on\n\u201cUnfortunately we know next to nothing of what he had discovered.",
    "Farquhar had been methodically following up one line after another.",
    "Most of them led nowhere.\u201d\nGrant paused and then went on\n\u201cFarquhar was unconscious until a few minutes before he died.",
    "Then\nhe tried to say something.",
    "What he said was this N or M. Song Susie.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u201d said Tommy \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem very illuminating.\u201d\nGrant smiled.",
    "\u201cA little more so than you might think.",
    "N or M you see is a term we\nhave heard before.",
    "It refers to two of the most important and trusted\nGerman agents.",
    "We have come across their activities in other countries\n\n\fand we know just a little about them.",
    "It is their mission to organise a\nFifth Column in foreign countries and to act as liaison officer between\nthe country in question and Germany.",
    "N we know is a man.",
    "M is a\nwoman.",
    "All we know about them is that these two are Hitler\u2019s most\nhighly trusted agents and that in a code message we managed to decipher\ntowards the beginning of the war there occurred this phrase\u2014Suggest N\nor M for England.",
    "Full powers\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "And Farquhar\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAs I see it Farquhar must have got on the track of one or other of\nthem.",
    "Unfortunately we don\u2019t know which.",
    "Song Susie sounds very\ncryptic\u2014but Farquhar hadn\u2019t a highclass French accent There was a\nreturn ticket to Leahampton in his pocket which is suggestive.",
    "Leahampton is on the south coast\u2014a budding Bournemouth or Torquay.",
    "Lots of private hotels and guesthouses.",
    "Amongst them is one called Sans\nSouci\u2014\u201d\nTommy said again\n\u201cSong Susie\u2014Sans Souci\u2014I see.\u201d\nGrant said \u201cDo you\u201d\n\u201cThe idea is\u201d Tommy said \u201cthat I should go there and\u2014well\u2014ferret\nround.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the idea.\u201d\nTommy\u2019s smile broke out again.",
    "\u201cA bit vague isn\u2019t it\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m\nlooking for.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I can\u2019t tell you.",
    "I don\u2019t know.",
    "It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\nTommy sighed.",
    "He squared his shoulders.",
    "\u201cI can have a shot at it.",
    "But I\u2019m not a very brainy sort of chap.\u201d\n\u201cYou did pretty well in the old days so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cOh that was pure luck\u201d said Tommy hastily.",
    "\u201cWell luck is rather what we need.\u201d\nTommy considered a moment or two.",
    "Then he said\n\u201cAbout this place Sans Souci\u2014\u201d\nGrant shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cMay be all a mare\u2019s nest.",
    "I can\u2019t tell.",
    "Farquhar may have been\nthinking of \u2018Sister Susie sewing shirts for soldiers.\u2019 It\u2019s all guesswork.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd Leahampton itself\u201d\n\u201cJust like any other of these places.",
    "There are rows of them.",
    "Old\nladies old Colonels unimpeachable spinsters dubious customers fishy\ncustomers a foreigner or two.",
    "In fact a mixed bag.\u201d\n\u201cAnd N or M amongst them\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily.",
    "Somebody perhaps who\u2019s in touch with N or M.\nBut it\u2019s quite likely to be N or M themselves.",
    "It\u2019s an inconspicuous sort\nof place a boardinghouse at a seaside resort.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea whether it\u2019s a man or a woman I\u2019ve to look for\u201d\nGrant shook his head.",
    "Tommy said \u201cWell I can but try.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck to your trying Beresford.",
    "Now\u2014to details\u2014\u201d\n\nII\nHalf an hour later when Tuppence broke in panting and eager with\ncuriosity Tommy was alone whistling in an armchair with a doubtful\nexpression on his face.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d demanded Tuppence throwing an infinity of feeling into the\nmonosyllable.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Tommy with a somewhat doubtful air \u201cI\u2019ve got a job\u2014\nof kinds.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind\u201d\nTommy made a suitable grimace.",
    "\u201cOffice work in the wilds of Scotland.",
    "Hushhush and all that but\ndoesn\u2019t sound very thrilling.\u201d\n\u201cBoth of us or only you\u201d\n\u201cOnly me I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cBlast and curse you.",
    "How could our Mr. Carter be so mean\u201d\n\u201cI imagine they segregate the sexes in these jobs.",
    "Otherwise too\ndistracting for the mind.\u201d\n\u201cIs it coding\u2014or code breaking Is it like Deborah\u2019s job Do be\ncareful Tommy people go queer doing that and can\u2019t sleep and walk\nabout all night groaning and repeating 978345286 or something like that\nand finally have nervous breakdowns and go into homes.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNot me.\u201d\nTuppence said gloomily\n\u201cI expect you will sooner or later.",
    "Can I come too\u2014not to work but\njust as a wife.",
    "Slippers in front of the fire and a hot meal at the end of the\nday\u201d\nTommy looked uncomfortable.",
    "\u201cSorry old thing.",
    "I am sorry.",
    "I hate leaving you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut you feel you ought to go\u201d murmured Tuppence reminiscently.",
    "\u201cAfter all\u201d said Tommy feebly \u201cyou can knit you know.\u201d\n\u201cKnit\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cKnit\u201d\nSeizing her Balaclava helmet she flung it on the ground.",
    "\u201cI hate khaki wool\u201d said Tuppence \u201cand Navy wool and Air Force\nblue.",
    "I should like to knit something magenta\u201d\n\u201cIt has a fine military sound\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cAlmost a suggestion of\nBlitzkrieg.\u201d\nHe felt definitely very unhappy.",
    "Tuppence however was a Spartan\nand played up well admitting freely that of course he had to take the job\nand that it didn\u2019t really matter about her.",
    "She added that she had heard\nthey wanted someone to scrub down the FirstAid Post floors.",
    "She might\npossibly be found fit to do that.",
    "Tommy departed for Aberdeen three days later.",
    "Tuppence saw him\noff at the station.",
    "Her eyes were bright and she blinked once or twice but\nshe kept resolutely cheerful.",
    "Only as the train drew out of the station and Tommy saw the forlorn\nlittle figure walking away down the platform did he feel a lump in his\nown throat.",
    "War or no war he felt he was deserting Tuppence. . . .",
    "He pulled himself together with an effort.",
    "Orders were orders.",
    "Having duly arrived in Scotland he took a train the next day to\nManchester.",
    "On the third day a train deposited him at Leahampton.",
    "Here\nhe went to the principal hotel and on the following day made a tour of\nvarious private hotels and guesthouses seeing rooms and inquiring terms\nfor a long stay.",
    "Sans Souci was a dark red Victorian villa set on the side of a hill\nwith a good view over the sea from its upper windows.",
    "There was a\nslight smell of dust and cooking in the hall and the carpet was worn but\n\n\fit compared quite favourably with some of the other establishments\nTommy had seen.",
    "He interviewed the proprietress Mrs. Perenna in her\noffice a small untidy room with a large desk covered with loose papers.",
    "Mrs. Perenna herself was rather untidy looking a woman of middleage with a large mop of fiercely curling black hair some vaguely applied\nmakeup and a determined smile showing a lot of very white teeth.",
    "Tommy murmured a mention of his elderly cousin Miss Meadowes\nwho had stayed at Sans Souci two years ago.",
    "Mrs. Perenna remembered\nMiss Meadowes quite well\u2014such a dear old lady\u2014at least perhaps not\nreally old\u2014very active and such a sense of humour.",
    "Tommy agreed cautiously.",
    "There was he knew a real Miss\nMeadowes\u2014the department was careful about these points.",
    "And how was dear Miss Meadowes\nTommy explained sadly that Miss Meadowes was no more and Mrs.\nPerenna clicked her teeth sympathetically and made the proper noises\nand put on a correct mourning face.",
    "She was soon talking volubly again.",
    "She had she was sure just the\nroom that would suit Mr. Meadowes.",
    "A lovely sea view.",
    "She thought Mr.\nMeadowes was so right to want to get out of London.",
    "Very depressing\nnowadays so she understood and of course after such a bad go of\ninfluenza\u2014\nStill talking Mrs. Perenna led Tommy upstairs and showed him\nvarious bedrooms.",
    "She mentioned a weekly sum.",
    "Tommy displayed\ndismay.",
    "Mrs. Perenna explained that prices had risen so appallingly.",
    "Tommy explained that his income had unfortunately decreased and what\nwith taxation and one thing and another\u2014\nMrs. Perenna groaned and said\n\u201cThis terrible war\u2014\u201d\nTommy agreed and said that in his opinion that fellow Hitler ought to\nbe hanged.",
    "A madman that\u2019s what he was a madman.",
    "Mrs. Perenna agreed and said that what with rations and the difficulty\nthe butchers had in getting the meat they wanted\u2014and sometimes too\nmuch and sweetbreads and liver practically disappeared it all made\nhousekeeping very difficult but as Mr. Meadowes was a relation of Miss\nMeadowes she would make it half a guinea less.",
    "Tommy then beat a retreat with the promise to think it over and Mrs.\nPerenna pursued him to the gate talking more volubly than ever and\ndisplaying an archness that Tommy found most alarming.",
    "She was he\nadmitted quite a handsome woman in her way.",
    "He found himself\nwondering what her nationality was.",
    "Surely not quite English The name\nwas Spanish or Portuguese but that would be her husband\u2019s nationality\nnot hers.",
    "She might he thought be Irish though she had no brogue.",
    "But\nit would account for the vitality and the exuberance.",
    "It was finally settled that Mr. Meadowes should move in the\nfollowing day.",
    "Tommy timed his arrival for six o\u2019clock.",
    "Mrs. Perenna came out into\nthe hall to greet him threw a series of instructions about his luggage to\nan almost imbecilelooking maid who goggled at Tommy with her\nmouth open and then led him into what she called the lounge.",
    "\u201cI always introduce my guests\u201d said Mrs. Perenna beaming\ndeterminedly at the suspicious glares of five people.",
    "\u201cThis is our new\narrival Mr. Meadowes\u2014Mrs.",
    "O\u2019Rourke.\u201d A terrifying mountain of a\nwoman with beady eyes and a moustache gave him a beaming smile.",
    "\u201cMajor Bletchley.\u201d Major Bletchley eyed Tommy appraisingly and\nmade a stiff inclination of the head.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "von Deinim.\u201d A young man very stiff fairhaired and blueeyed got up and bowed.",
    "\u201cMiss Minton.\u201d An elderly woman with a lot of beads knitting with\nkhaki wool smiled and tittered.",
    "\u201cAnd Mrs. Blenkensop.\u201d More knitting\u2014an untidy dark head which\nlifted from an absorbed contemplation of a Balaclava helmet.",
    "Tommy held his breath the room spun round.",
    "Mrs. Blenkensop Tuppence By all that was impossible and\nunbelievable\u2014Tuppence calmly knitting in the lounge of Sans Souci.",
    "Her eyes met his\u2014polite uninterested stranger\u2019s eyes.",
    "His admiration rose.",
    "Tuppence\n\n\fTwo\n\nHow Tommy got through that evening he never quite knew.",
    "He dared\nnot let his eyes stray too often in the direction of Mrs. Blenkensop.",
    "At\ndinner three more habitu\u00e9s of Sans Souci appeared\u2014a middleaged\ncouple Mr. and Mrs. Cayley and a young mother Mrs. Sprot who had\ncome down with her baby girl from London and was clearly much bored\nby her enforced stay at Leahampton.",
    "She was placed next to Tommy and\nat intervals fixed him with a pair of pale gooseberry eyes and in a\nslightly adenoidal voice asked \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s really quite safe\nnow Everyone\u2019s going back aren\u2019t they\u201d\nBefore Tommy could reply to these artless queries his neighbour on\nthe other side the beaded lady struck in\n\u201cWhat I say is one mustn\u2019t risk anything with children.",
    "Your sweet\nlittle Betty.",
    "You\u2019d never forgive yourself and you know that Hitler has\nsaid the Blitzkrieg on England is coming quite soon now\u2014and quite a\nnew kind of gas I believe.\u201d\nMajor Bletchley cut in sharply\n\u201cLot of nonsense talked about gas.",
    "The fellows won\u2019t waste time\nfiddling round with gas.",
    "High explosive and incendiary bombs.",
    "That\u2019s\nwhat was done in Spain.\u201d\nThe whole table plunged into the argument with gusto.",
    "Tuppence\u2019s\nvoice highpitched and slightly fatuous piped out \u201cMy son Douglas\nsays\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDouglas indeed\u201d thought Tommy.",
    "\u201cWhy Douglas I should like to\nknow.\u201d\n\n\fAfter dinner a pretentious meal of several meagre courses all of\nwhich were equally tasteless everyone drifted into the lounge.",
    "Knitting\nwas resumed and Tommy was compelled to hear a long and extremely\nboring account of Major Bletchley\u2019s experiences on the NorthWest\nFrontier.",
    "The fair young man with the bright blue eyes went out executing a\nlittle bow on the threshold of the room.",
    "Major Bletchley broke off his narrative and administered a kind of\ndig in the ribs to Tommy.",
    "\u201cThat fellow who\u2019s just gone out.",
    "He\u2019s a refugee.",
    "Got out of\nGermany about a month before the war.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a German\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Not a Jew either.",
    "His father got into trouble for criticising the\nNazi r\u00e9gime.",
    "Two of his brothers are in concentration camps over there.",
    "This fellow got out just in time.\u201d\nAt this moment Tommy was taken possession of by Mr. Cayley who\ntold him at interminable length all about his health.",
    "So absorbing was the\nsubject to the narrator that it was close upon bedtime before Tommy\ncould escape.",
    "On the following morning Tommy rose early and strolled down to\nthe front.",
    "He walked briskly to the pier returning along the esplanade\nwhen he spied a familiar figure coming in the other direction.",
    "Tommy\nraised his hat.",
    "\u201cGood morning\u201d he said pleasantly.",
    "\u201cEr\u2014Mrs.",
    "Blenkensop isn\u2019t\nit\u201d\nThere was no one within earshot.",
    "Tuppence replied\n\u201cDr.",
    "Livingstone to you.\u201d\n\u201cHow on earth did you get here Tuppence\u201d murmured Tommy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s\na miracle\u2014an absolute miracle.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a miracle at all\u2014just brains.\u201d\n\u201cYour brains I suppose\u201d\n\u201cYou suppose rightly.",
    "You and your uppish Mr. Grant.",
    "I hope this\nwill teach him a lesson.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly ought to\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cCome on Tuppence tell me\nhow you managed it.",
    "I\u2019m simply devoured with curiosity.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIt was quite simple.",
    "The moment Grant talked of our Mr. Carter I\nguessed what was up.",
    "I knew it wouldn\u2019t be just some miserable office\njob.",
    "But his manner showed me that I wasn\u2019t going to be allowed in on\nthis.",
    "So I resolved to go one better.",
    "I went to fetch some sherry and\nwhen I did I nipped down to the Browns\u2019 flat and rang up Maureen.",
    "Told her to ring me up and what to say.",
    "She played up loyally\u2014nice high\nsqueaky voice\u2014you could hear what she was saying all over the room.",
    "I\ndid my stuff registered annoyance compulsion distressed friend and\nrushed off with every sign of vexation.",
    "Banged the hall door carefully\nremaining inside it and slipped into the bedroom and eased open the\ncommunicating door that\u2019s hidden by the tallboy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you heard everything\u201d\n\u201cEverything\u201d said Tuppence complacently.",
    "Tommy said reproachfully\n\u201cAnd you never let on\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not.",
    "I wished to teach you a lesson.",
    "You and your Mr.\nGrant.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not exactly my Mr. Grant and I should say you have taught him\na lesson.\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Carter wouldn\u2019t have treated me so shabbily\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think the Intelligence is anything like what it was in our day.\u201d\nTommy said gravely \u201cIt will attain its former brilliance now we\u2019re\nback in it.",
    "But why Blenkensop\u201d\n\u201cWhy not\u201d\n\u201cIt seems such an odd name to choose.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the first one I thought of and it\u2019s handy for underclothes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean Tuppence\u201d\n\u201cB you idiot.",
    "B for Beresford.",
    "B for Blenkensop.",
    "Embroidered on\nmy camiknickers.",
    "Patricia Blenkensop.",
    "Prudence Beresford.",
    "Why did\nyou choose Meadowes It\u2019s a silly name.\u201d\n\u201cTo begin with\u201d said Tommy \u201cI don\u2019t have large B\u2019s embroidered\non my pants.",
    "And to continue I didn\u2019t choose it.",
    "I was told to call myself\nMeadowes.",
    "Mr. Meadowes is a gentleman with a respectable past\u2014all of\nwhich I\u2019ve learnt by heart.\u201d\n\u201cVery nice\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cAre you married or single\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019m a widower\u201d said Tommy with dignity.",
    "\u201cMy wife died ten years\nago at Singapore.\u201d\n\u201cWhy at Singapore\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all got to die somewhere.",
    "What\u2019s wrong with Singapore\u201d\n\u201cOh nothing.",
    "It\u2019s probably a most suitable place to die.",
    "I\u2019m a\nwidow.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did your husband die\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter Probably in a nursing home.",
    "I rather fancy he died\nof cirrhosis of the liver.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "A painful subject.",
    "And what about your son Douglas\u201d\n\u201cDouglas is in the Navy.\u201d\n\u201cSo I heard last night.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got two other sons.",

    "Blenkensop was my second husband.",
    "My\nfirst husband\u2019s name was Hill.",
    "There are three pages of Hills in the\ntelephone book.",
    "You couldn\u2019t check up on all the Hills if you tried.\u201d\nTommy sighed.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the old trouble with you Tuppence.",
    "You will overdo things.",
    "Two husbands and three sons.",
    "It\u2019s too much.",
    "You\u2019ll contradict yourself\nover the details.\u201d\n\u201cNo I shan\u2019t.",
    "And I rather fancy the sons may come in useful.",
    "I\u2019m\nnot under orders remember.",
    "I\u2019m a freelance.",
    "I\u2019m in this to enjoy myself\nand I\u2019m going to enjoy myself.\u201d\n\u201cSo it seems\u201d said Tommy.",
    "He added gloomily \u201cIf you ask me the\nwhole thing\u2019s a farce.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you say that\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve been at Sans Souci longer than I have.",
    "Can you\nhonestly say you think any of these people who were there last night\ncould be a dangerous enemy agent\u201d\nTuppence said thoughtfully\n\u201cIt does seem a little incredible.",
    "There\u2019s the young man of course.\u201d\n\u201cCarl von Deinim.",
    "The police check up on refugees don\u2019t they\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI suppose so.",
    "Still it might be managed.",
    "He\u2019s an attractive young\nman you know.\u201d\n\u201cMeaning the girls will tell him things But what girls No\nGenerals\u2019 or Admirals\u2019 daughters floating around here.",
    "Perhaps he walks\nout with a Company Commander in the ATS.\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet Tommy.",
    "We ought to be taking this seriously.\u201d\n\u201cI am taking it seriously.",
    "It\u2019s just that I feel we\u2019re on a wildgoose\nchase.\u201d\nTuppence said seriously\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that.",
    "After all nothing\u2019s going to be obvious\nabout this business.",
    "What about Mrs. Perenna\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tommy thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s Mrs. Perenna I admit\u2014\nshe does want explaining.\u201d\nTuppence said in a businesslike tone\n\u201cWhat about us I mean how are we going to cooperate\u201d\nTommy said thoughtfully\n\u201cWe mustn\u2019t be seen about too much together.\u201d\n\u201cNo it would be fatal to suggest we know each other better than we\nappear to do.",
    "What we want to decide is the attitude.",
    "I think\u2014yes I think\n\u2014pursuit is the best angle.\u201d\n\u201cPursuit\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "I pursue you.",
    "You do your best to escape but being a mere\nchivalrous male don\u2019t always succeed.",
    "I\u2019ve had two husbands and I\u2019m on\nthe lookout for a third.",
    "You act the part of the hunted widower.",
    "Every\nnow and then I pin you down somewhere pen you in a caf\u00e9 catch you\nwalking on the front.",
    "Everyone sniggers and thinks it very funny.\u201d\n\u201cSounds feasible\u201d agreed Tommy.",
    "Tuppence said \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of agelong humour about the chased\nmale.",
    "That ought to stand us in good stead.",
    "If we are seen together all\nanyone will do is to snigger and say \u2018Look at poor old Meadowes.\u2019 \u201d\nTommy gripped her arm suddenly.",
    "\u201cLook\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cLook ahead of you.\u201d\nBy the corner of one of the shelters a young man stood talking to a\ngirl.",
    "They were both very earnest very wrapped up in what they were\nsaying.",
    "Tuppence said softly\n\u201cCarl von Deinim.",
    "Who\u2019s the girl I wonder\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s remarkably goodlooking whoever she is.\u201d\nTuppence nodded.",
    "Her eyes dwelt thoughtfully on the dark\npassionate face and on the tightfitting pullover that revealed the lines of\nthe girl\u2019s figure.",
    "She was talking earnestly with emphasis.",
    "Carl von\nDeinim was listening to her.",
    "Tuppence murmured\n\u201cI think this is where you leave me.\u201d\n\u201cRight\u201d agreed Tommy.",
    "He turned and strolled in the opposite direction.",
    "At the end of the promenade he encountered Major Bletchley.",
    "The\nlatter peered at him suspiciously and then grunted out \u201cGood morning.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d\n\u201cSee you\u2019re like me an early riser\u201d remarked Bletchley.",
    "Tommy said\n\u201cOne gets in the habit of it out East.",
    "Of course that\u2019s many years ago\nnow but I still wake early.\u201d\n\u201cQuite right too\u201d said Major Bletchley with approval.",
    "\u201cGod these\nyoung fellows nowadays make me sick.",
    "Hot baths\u2014coming down to\nbreakfast at ten o\u2019clock or later.",
    "No wonder the Germans have been\nputting it over on us.",
    "No stamina.",
    "Soft lot of young pups.",

    "Tuck\n\u2019em up at night with hotwater bottles.",
    "Faugh Makes me sick\u201d\nTommy shook his head in melancholy fashion and Major Bletchley\nthus encouraged went on\n\u201cDiscipline that\u2019s what we need.",
    "Discipline.",
    "How are we going to\nwin the war without discipline Do you know sir some of these fellows\ncome on parade in slacks\u2014so I\u2019ve been told.",
    "Can\u2019t expect to win a war\nthat way.",
    "Slacks My God\u201d\nMr. Meadowes hazarded the opinion that things were very different\nfrom what they had been.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all this democracy\u201d said Major Bletchley gloomily.",
    "\u201cYou can\noverdo anything.",
    "In my opinion they\u2019re overdoing the democracy\nbusiness.",
    "Mixing up the officers and the men feeding together in\n\n\frestaurants\u2014Faugh\u2014the men don\u2019t like it Meadowes.",
    "The troops\nknow.",

    "Tommy listened politely.",
    "Bletchley ended up wrathfully.",
    "\u201cAnd will they make use of me now No they will not.",
    "Too old.",
    "Too\nold be damned.",
    "I could teach one or two of these young cubs something\nabout war.\u201d\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s only what not to do\u201d suggested Tommy with a smile.",
    "\u201cEh what\u2019s that\u201d\nA sense of humour was clearly not Major Bletchley\u2019s strong suit.",
    "He\npeered suspiciously at his companion.",

    "\u201cKnow anything about that Mrs.\u2014Blenkensop I think her name is\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Blenkensop.",
    "Not a badlooking woman\u2014bit long in the\ntooth\u2014talks too much.",
    "Nice woman but foolish.",
    "No I don\u2019t know her.",
    "She\u2019s only been at Sans Souci a couple of days.\u201d He added \u201cWhy do\nyou ask\u201d\nTommy explained.",
    "\u201cHappened to meet her just now.",
    "Wondered if she was always out as\nearly as this\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know I\u2019m sure.",
    "Women aren\u2019t usually given to walking\nbefore breakfast\u2014thank God\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cAmen\u201d said Tommy.",
    "He went on \u201cI\u2019m not much good at making\npolite conversation before breakfast.",
    "Hope I wasn\u2019t rude to the woman\n\n\fbut I wanted my exercise.\u201d\nMajor Bletchley displayed instant sympathy.",

    "I\u2019m with you.",
    "Women are all very well in\ntheir place but not before breakfast.\u201d He chuckled a little.",
    "\u201cBetter be\ncareful old man.",
    "She\u2019s a widow you know.\u201d\n\u201cIs she\u201d\nThe Major dug him cheerfully in the ribs.",
    "\u201cWe know what widows are.",
    "She\u2019s buried two husbands and if you\nask me she\u2019s on the lookout for number three.",
    "Keep a very wary eye\nopen Meadowes.",
    "A wary eye.",
    "That\u2019s my advice.\u201d\nAnd in high good humour Major Bletchley wheeled about at the end\nof the parade and set the pace for a smart walk back to breakfast at Sans\nSouci.",
    "In the meantime Tuppence had gently continued her walk along the\nesplanade passing quite close to the shelter and the young couple talking\nthere.",

    "That part of\nLeahampton was known to house agents as the least desirable end.",
    "It was\nWest Leahampton and poorly thought of.",
    "Tommy paid 2d and strolled\nup the pier.",
    "It was a flimsy and weatherworn affair with a few moribund\npennyintheslot machines placed at far distant intervals.",
    "There was no\none on it but some children running up and down and screaming in\nvoices that matched quite accurately the screaming of the gulls and one\nsolitary man sitting on the end fishing.",

    "Then he asked gently\n\u201cCaught anything\u201d\nThe fisherman shook his head.",

    "That again would be an easy part to act.",
    "He has by his own admission\nbeen a good deal in Germany during the last few years.\u201d\n\u201cA point\u201d said Grant laconically.",
    "\u201cThen there\u2019s von Deinim.\u201d\n\u201cYes I don\u2019t need to tell you Meadowes that von Deinim\u2019s the one\nI\u2019m most interested in.\u201d\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s N\u201d\nGrant shook his head.",

    "Whether our\nadversaries are aware of that fact or not they can at any rate anticipate\nthat such a thing might happen.",
    "They would never risk the head of their\norganisation being interned.",
    "N therefore must be either a neutral\u2014or else\nhe is apparently an Englishman.",
    "The same of course applies to M. No\nmy meaning about von Deinim is this.",
    "He may be a link in the chain.",
    "N\nor M may not be at Sans Souci it may be Carl von Deinim who is there\nand through him we may be led to our objective.",
    "That does seem to me\nhighly possible.",
    "The more so as I cannot very well see that any of the\nother inmates of Sans Souci are likely to be the person we are seeking.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had them more or less vetted I suppose sir\u201d\nGrant sighed\u2014a sharp quick sigh of vexation.",
    "\u201cNo that\u2019s just what it\u2019s impossible for me to do.",
    "I could have them\nlooked up by the department easily enough\u2014but I can\u2019t risk it\nBeresford.",
    "For you see the rot is in the department itself.",

    "That\u2019s where you come in the outsider.",
    "That\u2019s why you\u2019ve\ngot to work in the dark without help from us.",
    "It\u2019s our only chance\u2014and\nI daren\u2019t risk alarming them.",
    "There\u2019s only one person I\u2019ve been able to\ncheck up on.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s that sir\u201d\n\u201cCarl von Deinim himself.",
    "That\u2019s easy enough.",
    "Routine.",
    "I can have\nhim looked up\u2014not from the Sans Souci angle but from the enemy alien\nangle.\u201d\nTommy asked curiously\n\u201cAnd the result\u201d\nA curious smile came over the other\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cMaster Carl is exactly what he says he is.",
    "His father was indiscreet\nwas arrested and died in a concentration camp.",
    "Carl\u2019s elder brothers are\nin camps.",
    "His mother died in great distress of mind a year ago.",
    "He\nescaped to England a month before war broke out.",
    "Von Deinim has\nprofessed himself anxious to help this country.",
    "His work in a chemical\nresearch laboratory has been excellent and most helpful on the problem\n\n\fof immunising certain gases and in general decontamination\nexperiments.\u201d\nTommy said\n\u201cThen he\u2019s all right\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily.",
    "Our German friends are notorious for their\nthoroughness.",
    "If von Deinim was sent as an agent to England special\ncare would be taken that his record should be consistent with his own\naccount of himself.",
    "There are two possibilities.",
    "The whole von Deinim\nfamily may be parties to the arrangement\u2014not improbable under the\npainstaking Nazi regime.",
    "Or else this is not really Carl von Deinim but a\nman playing the part of Carl von Deinim.\u201d\nTommy said slowly \u201cI see.\u201d He added inconsequently\n\u201cHe seems an awfully nice young fellow.\u201d\nSighing Grant said \u201cThey are\u2014they nearly always are.",
    "It\u2019s an odd\nlife this service of ours.",
    "We respect our adversaries and they respect us.",
    "You usually like your opposite number you know\u2014even when you\u2019re\ndoing your best to down him.\u201d\nThere was silence as Tommy thought over the strange anomaly of\nwar.",

    "\u201cBut there are those for whom we\u2019ve neither respect nor liking\u2014and\nthose are the traitors within our own ranks\u2014the men who are willing to\nbetray their country and accept office and promotion from the foreigner\nwho has conquered it.\u201d\nTommy said with feeling\n\u201cMy God I\u2019m with you sir.",
    "That\u2019s a skunk\u2019s trick.\u201d\n\u201cAnd deserves a skunk\u2019s end.\u201d\nTommy said incredulously\n\u201cAnd there really are these\u2014these swine\u201d\n\u201cEverywhere.",

    "\u201cI don\u2019t mind lying in the least.",
    "To be quite honest I get a lot of\nartistic pleasure out of my lies.",
    "What gets me down is those moments\nwhen one forgets to lie\u2014the times when one is just oneself\u2014and gets\nresults that way that you couldn\u2019t have got any other.\u201d She paused and\nwent on \u201cThat\u2019s what happened to you last night\u2014with the girl.",

    "You\u2019re definitely on\nthe job.\u201d\nTuppence nodded but she looked a trifle abstracted.",
    "She said\n\u201cDo you remember after the last war\u2014when we were hunting down\nMr. Brown Do you remember what fun it was How excited we were\u201d\nTommy agreed his face lighting up.",

    "This is the second war we\u2019ve been in\u2014and\nwe feel quite different about this one.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u2014we see the pity of it and the waste\u2014and the horror.",
    "All the\nthings we were too young to think about before.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThat\u2019s it.",
    "In the last war I was scared every now and then\u2014and had\nsome pretty close shaves and went through hell once or twice but there\nwere good times too.\u201d\nTuppence said\n\u201cI suppose Derek feels like that\u201d\n\u201cBetter not think about him old thing\u201d Tommy advised.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Tuppence set her teeth.",

    "\u201cNo there isn\u2019t.",
    "The first thing I did when I arrived of course was to\nsize them all up and assess as it were possibilities.",
    "Some of them seem\nquite impossible.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as\u201d\n\u201cWell Miss Minton for instance the \u2018compleat\u2019 British spinster and\nMrs. Sprot and her Betty and the vacuous Mrs. Cayley.\u201d\n\u201cYes but nitwittishness can be assumed.\u201d\n\u201cOh quite but the fussy spinster and the absorbed young mother are\nparts that would be fatally easy to overdo\u2014and these people are quite\nnatural.",
    "Then where Mrs. Sprot is concerned there\u2019s the child.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose\u201d said Tommy \u201cthat even a secret agent might have a\nchild.\u201d\n\u201cNot with her on the job\u201d said Tuppence.",

    "\u201cNot from you Tuppence.",

    "Tuppence came slowly up the hill towards Sans Souci.",
    "Since it was\nnot a through road it ended at Smugglers\u2019 Rest Commander Haydock\u2019s\nhouse there was never much traffic\u2014a few tradesmen\u2019s vans in the\nmorning.",
    "Tuppence passed house after house amusing herself by noting\ntheir names.",
    "Bella Vista inaccurately named since the merest glimpse of\nthe sea was to be obtained and the main view was the vast Victorian\n\n\fbulk of Edenholme on the other side of the road.",
    "Karachi was the next\nhouse.",
    "After that came Shirley Tower.",
    "Then Sea View appropriate this\ntime Castle Clare somewhat grandiloquent since it was a small\nhouse Trelawny a rival establishment to that of Mrs. Perenna and\nfinally the vast maroon bulk of Sans Souci.",
    "It was just as she came near to it that Tuppence became aware of a\nwoman standing by the gate peering inside.",
    "There was something tense\nand vigilant about the figure.",
    "Almost unconsciously Tuppence softened the sound of her own\nfootsteps stepping cautiously upon her toes.",
    "It was not until she was close behind her that the woman heard her\nand turned.",
    "Turned with a start.",
    "She was a tall woman poorly even meanly dressed but her face was\nunusual.",
    "She was not young\u2014probably just under forty\u2014but there was a\ncontrast between her face and the way she was dressed.",
    "She was fairhaired with wide cheekbones and had been\u2014indeed still was\u2014\nbeautiful.",
    "Just for a minute Tuppence had a feeling that the woman\u2019s face\nwas somehow familiar to her but the feeling faded.",
    "It was not she\nthought a face easily forgotten.",
    "The woman was obviously startled and the flash of alarm that flitted\nacross her face was not lost on Tuppence.",
    "Something odd here\nTuppence said\n\u201cExcuse me are you looking for someone\u201d\nThe woman spoke in a slow foreign voice pronouncing the words\ncarefully as though she had learnt them by heart.",
    "\u201cThis \u2019ouse is Sans Souci\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I live there.",
    "Did you want someone\u201d\nThere was an infinitesimal pause then the woman said\n\u201cYou can tell me please.",
    "There is a Mr. Rosenstein there no\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Rosenstein\u201d Tuppence shook her head.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "I\u2019m afraid not.",
    "Perhaps he has been there and left.",
    "Shall I ask for you\u201d\nBut the strange woman made a quick gesture of refusal.",
    "She said\n\u201cNo\u2014no.",
    "I make mistake.",
    "Excuse please.\u201d\nThen quickly she turned and walked rapidly down the hill again.",
    "Tuppence stood staring after her.",
    "For some reason her suspicions\nwere aroused.",
    "There was a contrast between the woman\u2019s manner and\nher words.",
    "Tuppence had an idea that \u201cMr.",
    "Rosenstein\u201d was a fiction\nthat the woman had seized at the first name that came into her head.",
    "Tuppence hesitated a minute then she started down the hill after the\nother.",
    "What she could only describe as a \u201chunch\u201d made her want to\nfollow the woman.",
    "Presently however she stopped.",
    "To follow would be to draw\nattention to herself in a rather marked manner.",
    "She had clearly been on\nthe point of entering Sans Souci when she spoke to the woman to\nreappear on her trail would be to arouse suspicion that Mrs. Blenkensop\nwas something other than appeared on the surface\u2014that is to say if this\nstrange woman was indeed a member of the enemy plot.",
    "No at all costs Mrs. Blenkensop must remain what she seemed.",
    "Tuppence turned and retraced her steps up the hill.",
    "She entered Sans\nSouci and paused in the hall.",
    "The house seemed deserted as was usual\nearly in the afternoon.",
    "Betty was having her nap the elder members were\neither resting or had gone out.",
    "Then as Tuppence stood in the dim hall thinking over her recent\nencounter a faint sound came to her ears.",
    "It was a sound she knew quite\nwell\u2014the faint echo of a ting.",
    "The telephone at Sans Souci was in the hall.",
    "The sound that\nTuppence had just heard was the sound made when the receiver of an\nextension is taken off or replaced.",
    "There was one extension in the house\n\u2014in Mrs. Perenna\u2019s bedroom.",
    "Tommy might have hesitated.",
    "Tuppence did not hesitate for a minute.",
    "Very gently and carefully she lifted off the receiver and put it to her ear.",
    "Someone was using the extension.",
    "It was a man\u2019s voice.",
    "Tuppence\nheard\n\u201c\u2014Everything going well.",
    "On the fourth then as arranged.\u201d\nA woman\u2019s voice said \u201cYes carry on.\u201d\nThere was a click as the receiver was replaced.",
    "Tuppence stood there frowning.",
    "Was that Mrs. Perenna\u2019s voice\nDifficult to say with only those three words to go upon.",
    "If there had been\nonly a little more to the conversation.",
    "It might of course be quite an\n\n\fordinary conversation\u2014certainly there was nothing in the words she had\noverheard to indicate otherwise.",
    "A shadow obscured the light from the door.",
    "Tuppence jumped and\nreplaced the receiver as Mrs. Perenna spoke.",
    "\u201cSuch a pleasant afternoon.",
    "Are you going out Mrs. Blenkensop or\nhave you just come in\u201d\nSo it was not Mrs. Perenna who had been speaking from Mrs.\nPerenna\u2019s room.",
    "Tuppence murmured something about having had a\npleasant walk and moved to the staircase.",
    "Mrs. Perenna moved along the hall after her.",
    "She seemed bigger than\nusual.",
    "Tuppence was conscious of her as a strong athletic woman.",
    "She said\n\u201cI must get my things off\u201d and hurried up the stairs.",
    "As she turned\nthe corner of the landing she collided with Mrs. O\u2019Rourke whose vast\nbulk barred the top of the stairs.",
    "\u201cDear dear now Mrs. Blenkensop it\u2019s a great hurry you seem to be\nin.\u201d\nShe did not move aside just stood there smiling down at Tuppence\njust below her.",
    "There was as always a frightening quality about Mrs.\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s smile.",
    "And suddenly for no reason Tuppence felt afraid.",
    "The big smiling Irishwoman with her deep voice barring her way\nand below Mrs. Perenna closing in at the foot of the stairs.",
    "Tuppence glanced over her shoulder.",
    "Was it her fancy that there was\nsomething definitely menacing in Mrs. Perenna\u2019s upturned face Absurd\nshe told herself absurd.",
    "In broad daylight\u2014in a commonplace seaside\nboardinghouse.",
    "But the house was so very quiet.",
    "Not a sound.",
    "And she\nherself here on the stairs between the two of them.",
    "Surely there was\nsomething a little queer in Mrs. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s smile\u2014some fixed ferocious\nquality about it Tuppence thought wildly \u201clike a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nAnd then suddenly the tension broke.",
    "A little figure darted along the\ntop landing uttering shrill squeals of mirth.",
    "Little Betty Sprot in vest and\nknickers.",
    "Darting past Mrs. O\u2019Rourke shouting happily \u201cPeek bo\u201d as\nshe flung herself on Tuppence.",
    "The atmosphere had changed.",
    "Mrs. O\u2019Rourke a big genial figure\nwas crying out\n\u201cAh the darlin.\u2019 It\u2019s a great girl she\u2019s getting.\u201d\nBelow Mrs. Perenna had turned away to the door that led into the\nkitchen.",
    "Tuppence Betty\u2019s hand clasped in hers passed Mrs. O\u2019Rourke\nand ran along the passage to where Mrs. Sprot was waiting to scold the\ntruant.",
    "Tuppence went in with the child.",
    "She felt a queer sense of relief at the domestic atmosphere\u2014the\nchild\u2019s clothes lying about the woolly toys the painted crib the\nsheeplike and somewhat unattractive face of Mr. Sprot in its frame on the\ndressing table the burble of Mrs. Sprot\u2019s denunciation of laundry prices\nand really she thought Mrs. Perenna was a little unfair in refusing to\nsanction guests having their own electric irons\u2014\nAll so normal so reassuring so everyday.",
    "And yet\u2014just now\u2014on the stairs.",
    "\u201cNerves\u201d said Tuppence to herself.",
    "\u201cJust nerves\u201d\nBut had it been nerves Someone had been telephoning from Mrs.\nPerenna\u2019s room.",
    "Mrs. O\u2019Rourke Surely a very odd thing to do.",
    "It\nensured of course that you would not be overheard by the household.",
    "It must have been Tuppence thought a very short conversation.",
    "The\nmerest brief exchange of words.",
    "\u201cEverything going well.",
    "On the fourth as arranged.\u201d\nIt might mean nothing\u2014or a good deal.",
    "The fourth.",
    "Was that a date The fourth say of a month\nOr it might mean the fourth seat or the fourth lamppost or the fourth\nbreakwater\u2014impossible to know.",
    "It might just conceivably mean the Forth Bridge.",
    "There had been an\nattempt to blow that up in the last war.",
    "Did it mean anything at all\nIt might quite easily have been the confirmation of some perfectly\nordinary appointment.",
    "Mrs. Perenna might have told Mrs. O\u2019Rourke she\ncould use the telephone in her bedroom any time she wanted to do so.",
    "And the atmosphere on the stairs that tense moment might have\nbeen just her own overwrought nerves. . . .",
    "The quiet house\u2014the feeling that there was something sinister\u2014\nsomething evil. . . .\n\u201cStick to facts Mrs. Blenkensop\u201d said Tuppence sternly.",
    "\u201cAnd get\non with your job.\u201d\n\n\fFive\n\nCommander\n\nHaydock turned out to be a most genial host.",
    "He\n\nwelcomed Mr. Meadowes and Major Bletchley with enthusiasm and\ninsisted on showing the former \u201call over my little place.\u201d\nSmugglers\u2019 Rest had been originally a couple of coastguards\u2019\ncottages standing on the cliff overlooking the sea.",
    "There was a small\ncove below but the access to it was perilous only to be attempted by\nadventurous boys.",
    "Then the cottages had been bought by a London businessman who\nhad thrown them into one and attempted halfheartedly to make a garden.",
    "He had come down occasionally for short periods in summer.",
    "After that the cottages had remained empty for some years being let\nwith a modicum of furniture to summer visitors.",
    "\u201cThen some years ago\u201d explained Haydock \u201cit was sold to a man\ncalled Hahn.",
    "He was a German and if you ask me he was neither more\nor less than a spy.\u201d\nTommy\u2019s ears quickened.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s interesting\u201d he said putting down the glass from which he\nhad been sipping sherry.",
    "\u201cDamned thorough fellows they are\u201d said Haydock.",
    "\u201cGetting ready\neven then for this show\u2014at least that is my opinion.",
    "Look at the situation\nof this place.",
    "Perfect for signalling out to sea.",
    "Cove below where you\ncould land a motorboat.",
    "Completely isolated owing to the contour of the\ncliff.",
    "Oh yes don\u2019t tell me that fellow Hahn wasn\u2019t a German agent.\u201d\nMajor Bletchley said\n\u201cOf course he was.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat happened to him\u201d asked Tommy.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d said Haydock.",
    "\u201cThereby hangs a tale.",
    "Hahn spent a lot of\nmoney on this place.",
    "He had a way cut down to the beach for one thing\n\u2014concrete steps\u2014expensive business.",
    "Then he had the whole of the\nhouse done over\u2014bathrooms every expensive gadget you can imagine.",
    "And who did he set to do all this Not a local man.",
    "No a firm from\nLondon so it was said\u2014but a lot of the men who came down were\nforeigners.",
    "Some of them didn\u2019t speak a word of English.",
    "Don\u2019t you\nagree with me that that sounds extremely fishy\u201d\n\u201cA little odd certainly\u201d agreed Tommy.",
    "\u201cI was in the neighbourhood myself at the time living in a bungalow\nand I got interested in what this fellow was up to.",
    "I used to hang about to\nwatch the workmen.",
    "Now I\u2019ll tell you this\u2014they didn\u2019t like it\u2014they\ndidn\u2019t like it at all.",
    "Once or twice they were quite threatening about it.",
    "Why should they be if everything was all square and aboveboard\u201d\nBletchley nodded agreement.",
    "\u201cYou ought to have gone to the authorities\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cJust what I did do my dear fellow.",
    "Made a positive nuisance of\nmyself pestering the police.\u201d\nHe poured himself out another drink.",
    "\u201cAnd what did I get for my pains Polite inattention.",
    "Blind and deaf\nthat\u2019s what we were in this country.",
    "Another war with Germany was out\nof the question\u2014there was peace in Europe\u2014our relations with\nGermany were excellent.",
    "Natural sympathy between us nowadays.",

    "What was\nthe good of pointing out to people that the Germans were building the\nfinest Air Force in Europe and not just to fly round and have picnics\u201d\nMajor Bletchley said explosively\n\u201cNobody believed it Damned fools \u2018Peace in our time.\u2019\n\u2018Appeasement.\u2019 All a lot of blah\u201d\nHaydock said his face redder than usual with suppressed anger \u201cA\nwarmonger that\u2019s what they called me.",
    "The sort of chap they said who\nwas an obstacle to peace.",
    "Peace I knew what our Hun friends were at\nAnd mind this they prepare things a long time beforehand.",
    "I was\nconvinced that Mr. Hahn was up to no good.",
    "I didn\u2019t like his foreign\n\n\fworkmen.",

    "I\nkept on badgering away at people.\u201d\n\u201cStout fellow\u201d said Bletchley appreciatively.",
    "\u201cAnd finally\u201d said the Commander \u201cI began to make an impression.",

    "And he had\nthe sense to listen to me.",
    "His fellows began to nose around.",
    "Sure enough\nHahn decamped.",
    "Just slipped out and disappeared one fine night.",
    "The\npolice went over this place with a searchwarrant.",
    "In a safe which had\nbeen builtin in the dining room they found a wireless transmitter and\nsome pretty damaging documents.",
    "Also a big store place under the\ngarage for petrol\u2014great tanks.",
    "I can tell you I was cockahoop over\nthat.",
    "Fellows at the club used to rag me about my German spy complex.",
    "They dried up after that.",
    "Trouble with us in this country is that we\u2019re so\nabsurdly unsuspicious.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crime.",
    "Fools\u2014that\u2019s what we are\u2014fools.",
    "Why don\u2019t we intern\nall these refugees\u201d Major Bletchley was well away.",
    "\u201cEnd of the story was I bought the place when it came into the\nmarket\u201d continued the Commander not to be sidetracked from his pet\nstory.",
    "\u201cCome and have a look round Meadowes\u201d\n\u201cThanks I\u2019d like to.\u201d\nCommander Haydock was as full of zest as a boy as he did the\nhonours of the establishment.",
    "He threw open the big safe in the dining\nroom to show where the secret wireless had been found.",
    "Tommy was\ntaken out to the garage and was shown where the big petrol tanks had\nlain concealed and finally after a superficial glance at the two excellent\nbathrooms the special lighting and the various kitchen \u201cgadgets\u201d he\nwas taken down the steep concreted path to the little cove beneath whilst\nCommander Haydock told him all over again how extremely useful the\nwhole layout would be to an enemy in wartime.",
    "He was taken into the cave which gave the place its name and\nHaydock pointed out enthusiastically how it could have been used.",
    "Major Bletchley did not accompany the two men on their tour but\nremained peacefully sipping his drink on the terrace.",
    "Tommy gathered\nthat the Commander\u2019s spy hunt with its successful issue was that good\n\n\fgentleman\u2019s principal topic of conversation and that his friends had\nheard it many times.",
    "In fact Major Bletchley said as much when they were walking down\nto Sans Souci a little later.",
    "\u201cGood fellow Haydock\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut he\u2019s not content to let a good\nthing alone.",
    "We\u2019ve heard all about that business again and again until\nwe\u2019re sick of it.",
    "He\u2019s as proud of the whole bag of tricks up there as a cat\nof its kittens.\u201d\nThe simile was not too farfetched and Tommy assented with a\nsmile.",
    "The conversation then turning to Major Bletchley\u2019s own successful\nunmasking of a dishonest bearer in 1923 Tommy\u2019s attention was free to\npursue its own inward line of thought punctuated by sympathetic \u201cNot\nreallys\u201d\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t say so\u201d and \u201cWhat an extraordinary business\u201d\nwhich was all Major Bletchley needed in the way of encouragement.",
    "More than ever now Tommy felt that when the dying Farquhar had\nmentioned Sans Souci he had been on the right track.",
    "Here in this out of\nthe world spot preparations had been made a long time beforehand.",
    "The\narrival of the German Hahn and his extensive installation showed clearly\nenough that this particular part of the coast had been selected for a\nrallying point a focus of enemy activity.",
    "That particular game had been defeated by the unexpected activity of\nthe suspicious Commander Haydock.",
    "Round one had gone to Britain.",
    "But supposing that Smugglers\u2019 Rest had been only the first outpost of a\ncomplicated scheme of attack Smugglers\u2019 Rest that is to say had\nrepresented sea communications.",
    "Its beach inaccessible save for the path\ndown from above would lend itself admirably to the plan.",
    "But it was\nonly a part of the whole.",
    "Defeated on that part of the plan by Haydock what had been the\nenemy\u2019s response Might not he have fallen back upon the next best\nthing\u2014that is to say Sans Souci.",
    "The exposure of Hahn had come about\nfour years ago.",
    "Tommy had an idea from what Sheila Perenna had said\nthat it was very soon after that that Mrs. Perenna had returned to England\nand bought Sans Souci.",
    "The next move in the game\n\n\fIt would seem therefore that Leahampton was definitely an enemy\ncentre\u2014that there were already installations and affiliations in the\nneighbourhood.",
    "His spirits rose.",
    "The depression engendered by the harmless and\nfutile atmosphere of Sans Souci disappeared.",
    "Innocent as it seemed that\ninnocence was no more than skin deep.",
    "Behind that innocuous mask\nthings were going on.",
    "And the focus of it all so far as Tommy could judge was Mrs.\nPerenna.",
    "The first thing to do was to know more about Mrs. Perenna to\npenetrate behind her apparently simple routine of running her boarding\nestablishment.",
    "Her correspondence her acquaintances her social or warworking activities\u2014somewhere in all these must lie the essence of her\nreal activities.",
    "If Mrs. Perenna was the renowned woman agent\u2014M\u2014\nthen it was she who controlled the whole of the Fifth Column activities\nin this country.",
    "Her identity would be known to few\u2014only to those at the\ntop.",
    "But communications she must have with her chiefs of staff and it\nwas those communications that he and Tuppence had got to tap.",
    "At the right moment as Tommy saw well enough Smugglers\u2019 Rest\ncould be seized and held\u2014by a few stalwarts operating from Sans Souci.",
    "That moment was not yet but it might be very near.",
    "Once the German army was established in control of the channel\nports in France and Belgium they could concentrate on the invasion and\nsubjugation of Britain and things were certainly going very badly in\nFrance at the moment.",
    "Britain\u2019s Navy was allpowerful on the sea so the attack must come\nby air and by internal treachery\u2014and if the threads of internal treachery\nwere in Mrs. Perenna\u2019s keeping there was no time to lose.",
    "Major Bletchley\u2019s words chimed in with his thoughts\n\u201cI saw you know that there was no time to lose.",
    "I got hold of Abdul\nmy syce\u2014good fellow Abdul\u2014\u201d\nThe story droned on.",
    "Tommy was thinking\n\u201cWhy Leahampton Any reason It\u2019s out of the mainstream\u2014bit of a\nbackwater.",
    "Conservative oldfashioned.",
    "All those points make it\ndesirable.",
    "Is there anything else\u201d\n\n\fThere was a stretch of flat agricultural country behind it running\ninland.",
    "A lot of pasture.",
    "Suitable therefore for the landing of troopcarrying airplanes or of parachute troops.",
    "But that was true of many\nother places.",
    "There was also a big chemical works where it might be\nnoted Carl von Deinim was employed.",
    "Carl von Deinim.",
    "How did he fit in Only too well.",
    "He was not as\nGrant had pointed out the real head.",
    "A cog only in the machine.",
    "Liable\nto suspicion and internment at any moment.",
    "But in the meantime he\nmight have accomplished what had been his task.",
    "He had mentioned to\nTuppence that he was working on decontamination problems and on the\nimmunising of certain gases.",
    "There were probabilities there\u2014\nprobabilities unpleasant to contemplate.",
    "Carl Tommy decided a little reluctantly was in it.",
    "A pity because\nhe rather liked the fellow.",
    "Well he was working for his country\u2014taking\nhis life in his hands.",
    "Tommy had respect for such an adversary\u2014down\nhim by all means\u2014a firing party was the end but you knew that when\nyou took on your job.",
    "It was the people who betrayed their own land\u2014from within\u2014that\nreally roused a slow vindictive passion in him.",
    "By God he\u2019d get them\n\u201c\u2014And that\u2019s how I got them\u201d The Major wound up his story\ntriumphantly.",
    "\u201cPretty smart bit of work eh\u201d\nUnblushingly Tommy said\n\u201cMost ingenious thing I\u2019ve heard in my life Major.\u201d\n\nII\nMrs. Blenkensop was reading a letter on thin foreign paper stamped\noutside with the censor\u2019s mark.",
    "Incidentally the direct result of her conversation with \u201cMr.",
    "Faraday.\u201d\n\u201cDear Raymond\u201d she murmured.",
    "\u201cI was so happy about him out in\nEgypt and now it seems there is a big change round.",
    "All very secret of\ncourse and he can\u2019t say anything\u2014just that there really is a marvellous\nplan and that I\u2019m to be ready for some big surprise soon.",
    "I\u2019m glad to\nknow where he\u2019s being sent but I really don\u2019t see why\u2014\u201d\nBletchley grunted.",
    "\u201cSurely he\u2019s not allowed to tell you that\u201d\nTuppence gave a deprecating laugh and looked round the breakfast\ntable as she folded up her precious letter.",
    "\u201cOh we have our methods\u201d she said archly.",
    "\u201cDear Raymond knows\nthat if only I know where he is or where he\u2019s going I don\u2019t worry quite so\nmuch.",
    "It\u2019s quite a simple way too.",
    "Just a certain word you know and\nafter it the initial letters of the next words spell out the place.",
    "Of course it\nmakes rather a funny sentence sometimes\u2014but Raymond is really most\ningenious.",
    "I\u2019m sure nobody would notice.\u201d\nLittle murmurs arose round the table.",
    "The moment was well chosen\neverybody happened to be at the breakfast table together for once.",

    "Shortly after that various incidents occurred.",
    "The first was the smell in Mr. Meadowes\u2019 room.",
    "Mr. Meadowes not a complaining man by nature spoke about it\nmildly at first then with increasing firmness.",
    "Mrs. Perenna was summoned into conclave.",
    "With all the will to resist\nin the world she had to admit that there was a smell.",
    "A pronounced\nunpleasant smell.",
    "Perhaps she suggested the gas tap of the fire was\nleaking.",
    "Bending down and sniffing dubiously Tommy remarked that he did\nnot think the smell came from there.",
    "Nor from under the floor.",
    "He\nhimself thought definitely\u2014a dead rat.",

    "Perhaps a mouse\u2014though she\nherself had never seen a mouse.",
    "Mr. Meadowes said with firmness that he thought the smell indicated\nat least a rat\u2014and he added still more firmly that he was not going to\nsleep another night in the room until the matter had been seen to.",
    "He\nwould ask Mrs. Perenna to change his room.",
    "Mrs. Perenna said \u201cOf course she had just been about to suggest the\nsame thing.",
    "She was afraid that the only room vacant was rather a small\none and unfortunately it had no sea view but if Mr. Meadowes did not\nmind that\u2014\u201d\nMr. Meadowes did not.",
    "His only wish was to get away from the\nsmell.",
    "Mrs. Perenna thereupon accompanied him to a small bedroom the\ndoor of which happened to be just opposite the door of Mrs.\nBlenkensop\u2019s room and summoned the adenoidal semiidiotic Beatrice\nto \u201cmove Mr. Meadowes\u2019 things.\u201d She would she explained send for \u201ca\nman\u201d to take up the floor and search for the origin of the smell.",
    "Matters were settled satisfactorily on this basis.",
    "II\nThe second incident was Mr. Meadowes\u2019 hay fever.",
    "That was what he\ncalled it at first.",
    "Later he admitted doubtfully that he might just possibly\nhave caught cold.",
    "He sneezed a good deal and his eyes ran.",
    "If there was\na faint elusive suggestion of raw onion floating in the breeze in the\nvicinity of Mr. Meadowes\u2019 large silk handkerchief nobody noticed the\nfact and indeed a pungent amount of eau de cologne masked the more\npenetrating odour.",
    "Finally defeated by incessant sneezing and noseblowing Mr.\nMeadowes retired to bed for the day.",
    "It was on the morning of that day that Mrs. Blenkensop received a\nletter from her son Douglas.",
    "So excited and thrilled was Mrs.\nBlenkensop that everybody at Sans Souci heard about it.",
    "The letter had\nnot been censored at all she explained because fortunately one of\nDouglas\u2019s friends coming on leave had brought it so for once Douglas\nhad been able to write quite fully.",
    "\u201cAnd it just shows\u201d declared Mrs. Blenkensop wagging her head\nsagely \u201chow little we know really of what is going on.\u201d\n\n\fAfter breakfast she went upstairs to her room opened the japanned\nbox and put the letter away.",
    "Between the folded pages were some\nunnoticeable grains of rice powder.",
    "She closed the box again pressing\nher fingers firmly on its surface.",
    "As she left her room she coughed and from opposite came the sound\nof a highly histrionic sneeze.",
    "Tuppence smiled and proceeded downstairs.",
    "She had already made known her intention of going up to London for\nthe day\u2014to see her lawyer on some business and to do a little shopping.",
    "Now she was given a good sendoff by the assembled boarders and\nentrusted with various commissions\u2014\u201conly if you have time of course.\u201d\nMajor Bletchley held himself aloof from this female chatter.",

    "He was\nstanding leaning on the wall.",
    "His hands were clenched and as Tuppence\napproached he turned on her his usually impassive face convulsed with\nemotion.",

    "It cannot go\non.",

    "\u201cWhere are you off to I just came to see about\na parcel which seems to have gone astray.\u201d\nTuppence explained her plans.",
    "\u201cOh yes of course\u201d said Sheila carelessly.",
    "\u201cI do remember you\nsaying something about it but I hadn\u2019t realised it was today you were\ngoing.",
    "I\u2019ll come and see you into the train.\u201d\n\n\fSheila was more animated than usual.",
    "She looked neither badtempered nor sulky.",

    "She remained talking to Tuppence until the train\nleft the station.",
    "After waving from the window and watching the girl\u2019s figure recede\nTuppence sat down in her corner seat again and gave herself up to\nserious meditation.",
    "Was it she wondered an accident that Sheila had happened to be at\nthe station just at that time Or was it a proof of enemy thoroughness\nDid Mrs. Perenna want to make quite sure that the garrulous Mrs.\nBlenkensop really had gone to London\nIt looked very much like it.",
    "IV\nIt was not until the next day that Tuppence was able to have a conference\nwith Tommy.",
    "They had agreed never to attempt to communicate with\neach other under the roof of Sans Souci.",
    "Mrs. Blenkensop met Mr. Meadowes as the latter his hay fever\nsomewhat abated was taking a gentle stroll on the front.",
    "They sat down\non one of the promenade seats.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "Slowly Tommy nodded his head.",
    "He looked rather unhappy.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI got something.",
    "But Lord what a day.",
    "Perpetually\nwith an eye to the crack of the door.",
    "I\u2019ve got quite a stiff neck.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind your neck\u201d said Tuppence unfeelingly.",
    "\u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cWell the maids went in to do the bed and the room of course.",
    "And\nMrs. Perenna went in\u2014but that was when the maids were there and she\nwas just blowing them up about something.",
    "And the kid ran in once and\ncame out with a woolly dog.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes.",
    "Anyone else\u201d\n\u201cOne person\u201d said Tommy slowly.",

    "\u201cLunch time.",
    "He came out from the dining room early came up to\nhis room then sneaked across the passage and into yours.",
    "He was there\nabout a quarter of an hour.\u201d\nHe paused.",
    "\u201cThat settles it I think\u201d\nTuppence nodded.",
    "Yes it settled it all right.",
    "Carl von Deinim could have had no reason\nfor going into Mrs. Blenkensop\u2019s bedroom and remaining there for a\nquarter of an hour save one.",
    "His complicity was proved.",
    "He must be\nTuppence thought a marvellous actor. . . .\nHis words to her that morning had rung so very true.",
    "Well perhaps\nthey had been true in a way.",
    "To know when to use the truth was the\nessence of successful deception.",
    "Carl von Deinim was a patriot all right\nhe was an enemy agent working for his country.",
    "One could respect him\nfor that.",
    "Yes\u2014but destroy him too.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d she said slowly.",
    "\u201cSo am I\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s a good chap.\u201d\nTuppence said\n\u201cYou and I might be doing the same thing in Germany.\u201d\nTommy nodded.",

    "\u201cWell we know more or less where we are.",
    "Carl von Deinim\nworking in with Sheila and her mother.",
    "Probably Mrs. Perenna is the big\nnoise.",
    "Then there is that foreign woman who was talking to Carl\nyesterday.",
    "She\u2019s in it somehow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do we do now\u201d\n\u201cWe must go through Mrs. Perenna\u2019s room sometime.",
    "There might\nbe something there that would give us a hint.",
    "And we must tail her\u2014see\nwhere she goes and whom she meets.",
    "Tommy let\u2019s get Albert down\nhere.\u201d\nTommy considered the point.",
    "Many years ago Albert a pageboy in a hotel had joined forces with\nthe young Beresfords and shared their adventures.",
    "Afterwards he had\nentered their service and been the sole domestic prop of the\n\n\festablishment.",
    "Some six years ago he had married and was now the\nproud proprietor of The Duck and Dog pub in South London.",
    "Tuppence continued rapidly\n\u201cAlbert will be thrilled.",
    "We\u2019ll get him down here.",
    "He can stay at the\npub near the station and he can shadow the Perennas for us\u2014or anyone\nelse.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Mrs. Albert\u201d\n\u201cShe was going to her mother in Wales with the children last\nMonday.",
    "Because of air raids.",
    "It all fits in perfectly.\u201d\n\u201cYes that\u2019s a good idea Tuppence.",
    "Either of us following the woman\nabout would be rather conspicuous.",
    "Albert will be perfect.",
    "Now another\nthing\u2014I think we ought to watch out for that socalled Polish woman\nwho was talking to Carl and hanging about here.",
    "It seems to me that she\nprobably represents the other end of the business\u2014and that\u2019s what we\u2019re\nanxious to find.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes I do agree.",
    "She comes here for orders or to take messages.",
    "Next time we see her one of us must follow her and find out more about\nher.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about looking through Mrs. Perenna\u2019s room\u2014and Carl\u2019s too I\nsuppose\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll find anything in his.",
    "After all as a German\nthe police are liable to search it and so he\u2019d be careful not to have\nanything suspicious.",
    "The Perenna is going to be difficult.",
    "When she\u2019s out\nof the house Sheila is often there and there\u2019s Betty and Mrs. Sprot\nrunning about all over the landings and Mrs. O\u2019Rourke spends a lot of\ntime in her bedroom.\u201d\nShe paused.",
    "\u201cLunchtime is the best.\u201d\n\u201cMaster Carl\u2019s time\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "I could have a headache and go to my room\u2014no someone\nmight come up and want to minister to me.",
    "I know I\u2019ll just come in\nquietly before lunch and go up to my room without telling anyone.",

    "If I\u2019m caught I could always say I was\nlooking for aspirin or something.",
    "One of the gentlemen boarders in Mrs.\n\n\fPerenna\u2019s room would cause far more speculation.\u201d\nTommy grinned.",
    "\u201cOf a scandalous character.\u201d\nThen the smile died.",
    "He looked grave and anxious.",
    "\u201cAs soon as we can old thing.",
    "The news is bad today.",
    "We must get\non to something soon.\u201d\n\nV\nTommy continued his walk and presently entered the post office where\nhe put through a call to Mr. Grant and reported \u201cthe recent operation\nwas successful and our friend C is definitely involved.\u201d\nThen he wrote a letter and posted it.",
    "It was addressed to Mr. Albert\nBatt The Duck and Dog Glamorgan St. Kennington.",
    "Then he bought himself a weekly paper which professed to inform\nthe English world of what was really going to happen and strolled\ninnocently back in the direction of Sans Souci.",
    "Presently he was hailed by the hearty voice of Commander Haydock\nleaning from his twoseater car and shouting \u201cHallo Meadowes want a\nlift\u201d\nTommy accepted a lift gratefully and got in.",
    "\u201cSo you read that rag do you\u201d demanded Haydock glancing at the\nscarlet cover of the Inside Weekly News.",
    "Mr. Meadowes displayed the slight confusion of all readers of the\nperiodical in question when challenged.",

    "\u201cQuite well I think.",

    "She sees too much of that German fellow.",
    "Damned\nunpatriotic I call it.",

    "A smell of Irish stew and\nthe clatter of plates and murmur of voices came from afar.",
    "Sans Souci\nwas hard at work on its midday meal.",
    "Tuppence waited by the drawingroom door until Martha the maid\nhad passed across the hall and into the dining room then she ran quickly\nup the stairs shoeless.",

    "Not a nice job this.",
    "Quite unpardonable if Mrs. Perenna was\nsimply Mrs. Perenna.",

    "But later she would find the bureau drawer unlocked.",
    "Would she suspect then Or would she think she had left it unlocked\nherself by accident One did do such things.",
    "Had Tuppence been able to\nreplace the papers in such a way that they looked much the same as\nbefore\nSurely even if Mrs. Perenna did notice anything amiss she would be\nmore likely to suspect one of the servants than she would \u201cMrs.",
    "Blenkensop.\u201d And if she did suspect the latter wouldn\u2019t it be a mere case\nof suspecting her of undue curiosity There were people Tuppence\nknew who did poke and pry.",

    "Commander Haydock had immediately got in touch with the police\nand under his guidance they had gone out to the scene of the tragedy on\nthe cliff.",
    "But for the disturbing war news the tragedy would probably have\nbeen given much greater space in the papers than it was.",
    "Actually it\noccupied only one small paragraph.",
    "Both Tuppence and Tommy had to give evidence at the inquest and\nin case any reporters should think fit to take pictures of the more\nunimportant witnesses Mr. Meadowes was unfortunate enough to get\nsomething in his eye which necessitated a highly disfiguring eyeshade.",

    "Mr. Sprot hysterically summoned by\ntelegraph rushed down to see his wife but had to go back again the\nsame day.",
    "He seemed an amiable but not very interesting young man.",

    "Polonska she said had come to England in company with a cousin\nand his wife who were her only relatives so far as she knew.",
    "The\nwoman in her opinion was slightly mental.",
    "She understood from her\nthat she had been through scenes of great horror in Poland and that her\nfamily including several children had all been killed.",
    "The woman\nseemed not at all grateful for anything done for her and was suspicious\nand taciturn.",
    "She muttered to herself a lot and did not seem normal.",
    "A\ndomestic post was found for her but she had left it without notice some\nweeks ago and without reporting to the police.",
    "The coroner asked why the woman\u2019s relatives had not come forward\nand at this point Inspector Brassey made an explanation.",
    "The couple in question were being detained under the Defence of the\nRealm Act for an offence in connection with a Naval dockyard.",
    "He\nstated that these two aliens had posed as refugees to enter the country\nbut had immediately tried to obtain employment near a Naval base.",
    "The\nwhole family was looked upon with suspicion.",
    "They had had a larger\nsum of money in their possession than could be accounted for.",
    "Nothing\nwas actually known against the deceased woman Polonska\u2014except that\nher sentiments were believed to have been antiBritish.",
    "It was possible\nthat she also had been an enemy agent and that her pretended stupidity\nwas assumed.",
    "Mrs. Sprot when called dissolved at once into tears.",
    "The coroner\nwas gentle with her leading her tactfully along the path of what had\noccurred.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s so awful\u201d gasped Mrs. Sprot.",
    "\u201cSo awful to have killed\nsomeone.",

    "Oh dear\u2014I feel as\nthough I\u2019d murdered someone.\u201d\nThe coroner soothed her and asked if she had ever come in contact\nwith the dead woman.",
    "\u201cOh no.",
    "I\u2019d never seen her in my life.",
    "I think she must have been\nquite mad\u2014because she didn\u2019t even know me or Betty.\u201d\nIn reply to further questions Mrs. Sprot said that she had attended a\nsewing party for comforts for Polish refugees but that that was the\nextent of her connection with Poles in this country.",
    "Haydock was the next witness and he described the steps he had\ntaken to track down the kidnapper and what had eventually happened.",
    "\u201cYou are clear in your mind that the woman was definitely preparing\nto jump over the cliff\u201d\n\u201cEither that or to throw the child over.",
    "She seemed to be quite\ndemented with hate.",
    "It would have been impossible to reason with her.",
    "It\nwas a moment for immediate action.",

    "Mrs. Blenkensop\u2019s evidence was short\u2014a mere confirming of the\nCommander\u2019s evidence.",
    "Mr. Meadowes followed.",
    "\u201cYou agree with Commander Haydock and Mrs. Blenkensop as to\nwhat occurred\u201d\n\u201cI do.",
    "The woman was definitely so distraught that it was impossible\nto get near her.",
    "She was about to throw herself and the child over the\ncliff.\u201d\nThere was little more evidence.",
    "The coroner directed the jury that\nVanda Polonska came to her death by the hand of Mrs. Sprot and\nformally exonerated the latter from blame.",
    "There was no evidence to\nshow what was the state of the dead woman\u2019s mind.",
    "She might have been\nactuated by hate of England.",
    "Some of the Polish \u201ccomforts\u201d distributed\nto refugees bore the names of the ladies sending them and it was\npossible that the woman got Mrs. Sprot\u2019s name and address this way but\nit was not easy to get at her reason for kidnapping the child\u2014possibly\nsome crazy motive quite incomprehensible to the normal mind.",
    "Polonska according to her own story had suffered great bereavement in\n\n\fher own country and that might have turned her brain.",
    "On the other\nhand she might be an enemy agent.",

    "He added \u201cYou know Tuppence I don\u2019t like the look of things.\u201d\nTuppence assented.",
    "The news was indeed far from reassuring.",
    "The French Army was in retreat and it seemed doubtful if the tide\ncould be turned.",
    "Evacuation from Dunkirk was in progress.",
    "It was clearly\na matter of a few days only before Paris fell.",
    "There was a general dismay\nat the revelation of lack of equipment and of material for resisting the\nGermans\u2019 great mechanised units.",
    "Tommy said\n\u201cIs it only our usual muddling and slowness Or has there been\ndeliberate engineering behind this\u201d\n\u201cThe latter I think but they\u2019ll never be able to prove it.\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Our adversaries are too damned clever for that.\u201d\n\u201cWe are combing out a lot of the rot now.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes we\u2019re rounding up the obvious people but I don\u2019t believe\nwe\u2019ve got at the brains that are behind it all.",

    "From there he had walked with a Mr.\n\n\fWalters and a Dr. Curtis as far as the gate of Sans Souci where he had\nsaid goodbye to them and turned into the drive.",
    "From that moment Mr. Meadowes seemed to have disappeared into\nspace.",
    "In Tuppence\u2019s mind two possibilities emerged from this.",
    "When walking up the drive Tommy may have seen Mrs. Perenna\ncoming towards him have slipped into the bushes and then have\nfollowed her.",
    "Having observed her rendezvous with some unknown\nperson he might then have followed the latter whilst Mrs. Perenna\nreturned to Sans Souci.",
    "In that case he was probably very much alive\nand busy on a trail.",
    "In which case the wellmeant endeavours of the\npolice to find him might prove most embarrassing.",
    "The other possibility was not so pleasant.",
    "It resolved itself into two\npictures\u2014one that of Mrs. Perenna returning \u201cout of breath and\ndishevelled\u201d\u2014the other one that would not be laid aside a picture of\nMrs. O\u2019Rourke standing smiling in the window holding a heavy\nhammer.",
    "That hammer had horrible possibilities.",
    "For what should a hammer be doing lying outside\nAs to who had wielded it that was more difficult.",
    "A good deal\ndepended on the exact time when Mrs. Perenna had reentered the house.",
    "It was certainly somewhere in the neighbourhood of halfpast ten but\nnone of the bridge party happened to have noted the time exactly.",
    "Mrs.\nPerenna had declared vehemently that she had not been out except just to\nlook at the weather.",
    "But one does not get out of breath just looking at the\nweather.",
    "It was clearly extremely vexing to her to have been seen by\nMrs. Sprot.",
    "With ordinary luck the four ladies might have been safely\naccounted for as busy playing bridge.",
    "What had the time been exactly\nTuppence found everybody extremely vague on the subject.",
    "If the time agreed Mrs. Perenna was clearly the most likely suspect.",
    "But there were other possibilities.",
    "Of the inhabitants of Sans Souci three\nhad been out at the time of Tommy\u2019s return.",
    "Major Bletchley had been\nout at the cinema\u2014but he had been to it alone and the way that he had\n\n\finsisted on retailing the whole picture so meticulously might suggest to a\nsuspicious mind that he was deliberately establishing an alibi.",
    "Then there was the valetudinarian Mr. Cayley who had gone for a\nwalk all round the garden.",
    "But for the accident of Mrs. Cayley\u2019s anxiety\nover her spouse no one might have ever heard of that walk and might\nhave imagined Mr. Cayley to have remained securely encased in rugs\nlike a mummy in his chair on the terrace.",
    "Rather unlike him really to\nrisk the contamination of the night air so long.",
    "And there was Mrs. O\u2019Rourke herself swinging the hammer and\nsmiling. . . .\n\nIV\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Deb You\u2019re looking worried my sweet.\u201d\nDeborah Beresford started and then laughed looking frankly into\nTony Marsdon\u2019s sympathetic brown eyes.",
    "She liked Tony.",
    "He had brains\n\u2014was one of the most brilliant beginners in the coding department\u2014and\nwas thought likely to go far.",
    "Deborah enjoyed her job though she found it made somewhat\nstrenuous demands on her powers of concentration.",
    "It was tiring but it\nwas worthwhile and it gave her a pleasant feeling of importance.",
    "This\nwas real work\u2014not just hanging about a hospital waiting for a chance to\nnurse.",
    "She said\n\u201cOh nothing.",
    "Just family You know.\u201d\n\u201cFamilies are a bit trying.",
    "What\u2019s yours been up to\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my mother.",
    "To tell the truth I\u2019m just a bit worried about her.\u201d\n\u201cWhy What\u2019s happened\u201d\n\u201cWell you see she went down to Cornwall to a frightfully trying old\naunt of mine.",
    "Seventyeight and completely gaga.\u201d\n\u201cSounds grim\u201d commented the young man sympathetically.",
    "\u201cYes it was really very noble of Mother.",
    "But she was rather hipped\nanyway because nobody seemed to want her in this war.",
    "Of course she\nnursed and did things in the last one\u2014but it\u2019s all quite different now and\nthey don\u2019t want these middleaged people.",
    "They want people who are\n\n\fyoung and on the spot.",
    "Well as I say Mother got a bit hipped over it all\nand so she went off down to Cornwall to stay with Aunt Gracie and\nshe\u2019s been doing a bit in the garden extra vegetable growing and all\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cQuite sound\u201d commented Tony.",
    "\u201cYes much the best thing she could do.",
    "She\u2019s quite active still you\nknow\u201d said Deborah kindly.",
    "\u201cWell that sounds all right.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes it isn\u2019t that.",
    "I was quite happy about her\u2014had a letter only\ntwo days ago sounding quite cheerful.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble then\u201d\n\u201cThe trouble is that I told Charles who was going down to see his\npeople in that part of the world to go and look her up.",
    "And he did.",
    "And\nshe wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t there\u201d\n\u201cNo.",

    "That\u2019s why\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes Albert\u201d\n\u201cWhat I mean is if he\u2019s come out in the open perhaps you\u2019d better\nnot.\u201d\nHe paused to arrange his ideas and then went on.",
    "\u201cI mean they\u2019ve blown the gaff on him but they mayn\u2019t know about\nyou\u2014and so it\u2019s up to you to keep under cover still.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could make up my mind\u201d sighed Tuppence.",
    "\u201cWhich way were you thinking of managing it madam\u201d\nTuppence murmured thoughtfully\n\u201cI thought I might lose a letter I\u2019d written\u2014make a lot of fuss about\nit seem very upset.",
    "Then it would be found in the hall and Beatrice\nwould probably put it on the hall table.",
    "Then the right person would get a\nlook at it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would be in the letter\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh roughly\u2014that I\u2019d been successful in discovering the identity of\nthe person in question and that I was to make a full report personally\ntomorrow.",
    "Then you see Albert N or M would have to come out in the\nopen and have a shot at eliminating me.\u201d\n\u201cYes and maybe they\u2019d manage it too.\u201d\n\u201cNot if I was on my guard.",
    "They\u2019d have I think to decoy me away\nsomewhere\u2014some lonely spot.",

    "Beresford.\u201d\nShe turned abruptly to see a tall dark young man with an agreeable\nbut slightly embarrassed smile.",
    "He said\n\u201cEr\u2014I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t remember me\u201d\nTuppence was thoroughly used to the formula.",

    "\u201cI\u2014er\u2014came to the flat with Deborah one day.\u201d\nDeborah\u2019s friends So many of them and all to Tuppence looking\nsingularly alike Some dark like this young man some fair an occasional\nredhaired one\u2014but all cast in the same mould\u2014pleasant wellmannered their hair in Tuppence\u2019s view just slightly too long.",
    "But\nwhen this was hinted Deborah would say \u201cOh Mother don\u2019t be so\nterribly 1916.",
    "I can\u2019t stand short hair.\u201d\nAnnoying to have run across and been recognised by one of\nDeborah\u2019s young men just now.",
    "However she could probably soon shake\nhim off.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m Anthony Marsdon\u201d explained the young man.",
    "Tuppence murmured mendaciously \u201cOh of course\u201d and shook\nhands.",

    "You see I\u2019m\nworking at the same job as Deborah and as a matter of fact something\nrather awkward has happened.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d\n\u201cWell you see Deborah\u2019s found out that you\u2019re not down in\nCornwall as she thought and that makes it a bit awkward doesn\u2019t it for\nyou\u201d\n\u201cOh bother\u201d said Tuppence concerned.",
    "\u201cHow did she find out\u201d\nTony Marsdon explained.",
    "He went on rather diffidently\n\u201cDeborah of course has no idea of what you\u2019re really doing.\u201d\nHe paused discreetly and then went on\n\u201cIt\u2019s important I imagine that she shouldn\u2019t know.",
    "My job actually\nis rather the same line.",
    "I\u2019m supposed to be just a beginner in the coding\ndepartment.",
    "Really my instructions are to express views that are mildly\nFascist\u2014admiration of the German system insinuations that a working\nalliance with Hitler wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing\u2014all that sort of thing\u2014just\nto see what response I get.",
    "There\u2019s a good deal of rot going on you see\nand we want to find out who\u2019s at the bottom of it.\u201d\n\u201cRot everywhere\u201d thought Tuppence.",
    "\u201cBut as soon as Deb told me about you\u201d continued the young man\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d better come straight down and warn you so that you can\ncook up a likely story.",
    "You see I happen to know what you are doing and\nthat it\u2019s of vital importance.",
    "It would be fatal if any hint of who you are\ngot about.",
    "I thought perhaps you could make it seem as though you\u2019d\njoined Captain Beresford in Scotland or wherever he is.",
    "You might say\nthat you\u2019d been allowed to work with him there.\u201d\n\u201cI might do that certainly\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully.",
    "Tony Marsdon said anxiously\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m butting in\u201d\n\u201cNo no I\u2019m very grateful to you.\u201d\nTony said rather inconsequentially\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019m\u2014well\u2014you see\u2014I\u2019m rather fond of Deborah.\u201d\nTuppence flashed him an amused quick glance.",
    "How far away it seemed that world of attentive young men and Deb\nwith her rudeness to them that never seemed to put them off.",
    "This young\nman was she thought quite an attractive specimen.",
    "She put aside what she called to herself \u201cpeacetime thoughts\u201d and\nconcentrated on the present situation.",
    "After a moment or two she said slowly\n\u201cMy husband isn\u2019t in Scotland.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he\u201d\n\u201cNo he\u2019s down here with me.",
    "At least he was Now\u2014he\u2019s\ndisappeared.\u201d\n\u201cI say that\u2019s bad\u2014or isn\u2019t it Was he on to something\u201d\nTuppence nodded.",
    "\u201cI think so.",
    "That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think that his disappearing like this is\nreally a bad sign.",
    "I think sooner or later he\u2019ll communicate with me\u2014in\nhis own way.\u201d She smiled a little.",
    "Tony said with some slight embarrassment\n\u201cOf course you know the game well I expect.",
    "But you ought to be\ncareful.\u201d\nTuppence nodded.",
    "\u201cI know what you mean.",
    "Beautiful heroines in books are always\neasily decoyed away.",
    "But Tommy and I have our methods.",
    "We\u2019ve got a\nslogan\u201d she smiled.",

    "In the centre of the fiery ball was a core of\npain the universe shrank the fiery ball swung more slowly\u2014he\ndiscovered suddenly that the nucleus of it was his own aching head.",
    "Slowly he became aware of other things\u2014of cold cramped limbs of\nhunger of an inability to move his lips.",
    "Slower and slower swung the fiery ball .",
    ". .",
    "It was now Thomas\nBeresford\u2019s head and it was resting on solid ground.",
    "Very solid ground.",
    "In fact something suspiciously like stone.",

    "Someone creeping up behind him had struck him down.",
    "That was\nthe reason of his aching head.",
    "And he\u2019d thought he\u2019d got away with it all right So Haydock after\nall hadn\u2019t been quite such a fool\nHaydock Haydock had gone back into Smugglers\u2019 Rest and closed\nthe door.",
    "How had he managed to get down the hill and be waiting for\nTommy in the grounds of Sans Souci\nIt couldn\u2019t be done.",
    "Not without Tommy seeing him.",
    "The manservant then Had he been sent ahead to lie in wait But\nsurely as Tommy had crossed the hall he had seen Appledore in the\n\n\fkitchen of which the door was slightly ajar Or did he only fancy he had\nseen him Perhaps that was the explanation.",
    "Anyway it didn\u2019t matter.",
    "The thing to do was to find out where he\nwas now.",
    "His eyes accustomed to the darkness picked out a small rectangle of\ndim light.",
    "A window or small grating.",
    "The air smelt chilly and musty.",
    "He\nwas he fancied lying in a cellar.",
    "His hands and feet were tied and a gag\nin his mouth was secured by a bandage.",
    "\u201cSeems rather as though I\u2019m for it\u201d thought Tommy.",
    "He tried gingerly to move his limbs or body but he could not\nsucceed.",
    "At that moment there was a faint creaking sound and a door\nsomewhere behind him was pushed open.",
    "A man with a candle came in.",
    "He set down the candle on the ground.",
    "Tommy recognised Appledore.",
    "The latter disappeared again and then returned carrying a tray on which\nwas a jug of water a glass and some bread and cheese.",
    "Stooping down he first tested the cords binding the other limbs.",
    "He\nthen touched the gag.",
    "He said in a quiet level voice\n\u201cI am about to take this off.",
    "You will then be able to eat and drink.",
    "If\nhowever you make the slightest sound I shall replace it immediately.\u201d\nTommy tried to nod his head which proved impossible so he opened\nand shut his eyes several times instead.",
    "Appledore taking this for consent carefully unknotted the bandage.",
    "His mouth freed Tommy spent some minutes easing his jaw.",
    "Appledore held the glass of water to his lips.",
    "He swallowed at first with\ndifficulty then more easily.",
    "The water did him the world of good.",
    "He murmured stiffly\n\u201cThat\u2019s better.",
    "I\u2019m not quite so young as I was.",
    "Now for the eats\nFritz\u2014or is it Franz\u201d\nThe man said quietly\n\u201cMy name here is Appledore.\u201d\nHe held the slice of bread and cheese up and Tommy bit at it\nhungrily.",
    "The meal washed down with water he then asked\n\n\f\u201cAnd what\u2019s the next part of the programme\u201d\nFor answer Appledore picked up the gag again.",
    "Tommy said quickly\n\u201cI want to see Commander Haydock.\u201d\nAppledore shook his head.",
    "Deftly he replaced the gag and went out.",
    "Tommy was left to meditate in darkness.",
    "He was awakened from a\nconfused sleep by the sound of the door reopening.",
    "This time Haydock\nand Appledore came in together.",
    "The gag was removed and the cords\nthat held his arms were loosened so that he could sit up and stretch his\narms.",
    "Haydock had an automatic pistol with him.",
    "Tommy without much inward confidence began to play his part.",
    "He said indignantly\n\u201cLook here Haydock what\u2019s the meaning of all this I\u2019ve been set\nupon\u2014kidnapped\u2014\u201d\nThe Commander was gently shaking his head.",

    "It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re a member of our Secret Service you think you\ncan\u2014\u201d\nAgain the other shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo no Meadowes.",
    "You weren\u2019t taken in by that story.",
    "No need to\nkeep up the pretence.\u201d\nBut Tommy showed no signs of discomfiture.",
    "He argued to himself\nthat the other could not really be sure.",
    "If he continued to play his part\u2014\n\u201cWho the devil do you think you are\u201d he demanded.",
    "\u201cHowever\ngreat your powers you\u2019ve no right to behave like this.",

    "\u201cBe quiet damn you.",
    "Earlier on it would have mattered to find out\nwho you were and who sent you.",
    "Now it doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "The time\u2019s short\nyou see.",
    "And you didn\u2019t have the chance to report to anyone what you\u2019d\nfound out.\u201d\n\u201cThe police will be looking for me as soon as I\u2019m reported missing.\u201d\nHaydock showed his teeth in a sudden gleam.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve had the police here this evening.",
    "Good fellows\u2014both friends of\nmine.",
    "They asked me all about Mr. Meadowes.",
    "Very concerned about his\ndisappearance.",
    "How he seemed that evening\u2014what he said.",
    "They never\ndreamt how should they that the man they were talking about was\npractically underneath their feet where they were sitting.",
    "It\u2019s quite clear\nyou see that you left this house well and alive.",
    "They\u2019d never dream of\nlooking for you here.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me here for ever\u201d Tommy said vehemently.",
    "Haydock said with a resumption of his most British manner\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary my dear fellow.",
    "Only until tomorrow night.",
    "There\u2019s a boat due in at my little cove\u2014and we\u2019re thinking of sending\nyou on a voyage for your health\u2014though actually I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be\nalive or even on board when they arrive at their destination.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder you didn\u2019t knock me on the head straight away.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s such hot weather my dear fellow.",
    "Just occasionally our sea\ncommunications are interrupted and if that were to be so\u2014well a dead\nbody on the premises has a way of announcing its presence.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Tommy.",
    "He did see.",
    "The issue was perfectly clear.",
    "He was to be kept alive\nuntil the boat arrived.",
    "Then he would be killed or drugged and his dead\nbody taken out to sea.",
    "Nothing would ever connect this body when\nfound with Smugglers\u2019 Rest.",
    "\u201cI just came along\u201d continued Haydock speaking in the most natural\nmanner \u201cto ask whether there is anything we could\u2014er\u2014do for you\u2014\nafterwards\u201d\nTommy reflected.",
    "Then he said\n\u201cThanks\u2014but I won\u2019t ask you to take a lock of my hair to the little\nwoman in St. John\u2019s Wood or anything of that kind.",
    "She\u2019ll miss me\n\n\fwhen payday comes along\u2014but I dare say she\u2019ll soon find a friend\nelsewhere.\u201d\nAt all costs he felt he must create the impression that he was\nplaying a lone hand.",
    "So long as no suspicion attached itself to Tuppence\nthen the game might still be won through though he was not there to\nplay it.",
    "\u201cAs you please\u201d said Haydock.",
    "\u201cIf you did care to send a message to\n\u2014your friend\u2014we would see that it was delivered.\u201d\nSo he was after all anxious to get a little information about this\nunknown Mr. Meadowes Very well then Tommy would keep him\nguessing.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "\u201cNothing doing\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cVery well.\u201d With an appearance of the utmost indifference Haydock\nnodded to Appledore.",
    "The latter replaced the bonds and the gag.",
    "The two\nmen went out locking the door behind them.",
    "Left to his reflections Tommy felt anything but cheerful.",
    "Not only\nwas he faced with the prospect of rapidly approaching death but he had\nno means of leaving any clue behind him as to the information he had\ndiscovered.",
    "His body was completely helpless.",
    "His brain felt singularly inactive.",

    ". .",
    "But he could\nthink of nothing helpful.",
    "There was of course still Tuppence.",
    "But what could Tuppence do\nAs Haydock had just pointed out Tommy\u2019s disappearance would not be\nconnected with him.",
    "Tommy had left Smugglers\u2019 Rest alive and well.",
    "The evidence of two independent witnesses would confirm that.",
    "Whoever Tuppence might suspect it would not be Haydock.",
    "And she\nmight not suspect at all.",
    "She might think that he was merely following up\na trail.",
    "Damn it all if only he had been more on his guard\u2014\nThere was a little light in the cellar.",
    "It came through the grating\nwhich was high up in one corner.",
    "If only he could get his mouth free he\ncould shout for help.",
    "Somebody might hear though it was very unlikely.",
    "For the next halfhour he busied himself straining at the cords that\nbound him and trying to bite through the gag.",
    "It was all in vain\nhowever.",
    "The people who had adjusted those things knew their business.",
    "It was he judged late afternoon.",
    "Haydock he fancied had gone out\nhe had heard no sounds from overhead.",
    "Confound it all he was probably playing golf speculating at the\nclubhouse over what could have happened to Meadowes\n\u201cDined with me night before last\u2014seemed quite normal then.",
    "Just\nvanished into the blue.\u201d\nTommy writhed with fury.",
    "That hearty English manner Was\neveryone blind not to see that bulletheaded Prussian skull He himself\nhadn\u2019t seen it.",
    "Wonderful what a firstclass actor could get away with.",
    "So here he was\u2014a failure\u2014an ignominious failure\u2014trussed up like\na chicken with no one to guess where he was.",
    "If only Tuppence could have second sight She might suspect.",
    "She\nhad sometimes an uncanny insight. . . .\nWhat was that\nHe strained his ears listening to a faroff sound.",
    "Only some man humming a tune.",
    "And here he was unable to make a sound to attract anyone\u2019s\nattention.",
    "The humming came nearer.",
    "A most untuneful noise.",
    "But the tune though mangled was recognisable.",
    "It dated from the\nlast war\u2014had been revived for this one.",
    "\u201cIf you were the only girl in the world and I was the only boy.\u201d\nHow often he had hummed that in 1917.",
    "Dash this fellow.",
    "Why couldn\u2019t he sing in tune\nSuddenly Tommy\u2019s body grew taut and rigid.",
    "Those particular lapses\nwere strangely familiar.",

    "With the advance of years he had become a person of slow mental\nprocesses but those processes were tenacious.",

    "\u201cThose Germans\u201d thought Albert gloomily and almost without\nrancour.",
    "Heiling Hitler and goosestepping and overrunning the world\nand bombing and machinegunning and generally making pestilential\nnuisances of themselves.",
    "They\u2019d got to be stopped no two ways about it\n\u2014and so far it seemed as though nobody had been able to stop them.",
    "And now here was Mrs. Beresford a nice lady if there ever was one\ngetting herself mixed up in trouble and looking out for more trouble and\nhow was he going to stop her Didn\u2019t look as though he could.",

    "Albert didn\u2019t like that at all.",
    "It looked to him as though \u201cthose\nGermans\u201d might be at the bottom of that.",
    "Yes it looked bad it did.",
    "Looked as though he might have copped\none.",
    "Albert was not given to the exercise of deep reasoning.",
    "Like most\nEnglishmen he felt something strongly and proceeded to muddle around\nuntil he had somehow or other cleared up the mess.",
    "Deciding that the\n\n\fmaster had got to be found Albert rather after the manner of a faithful\ndog set out to find him.",
    "He acted upon no settled plan but proceeded in exactly the same way\nas he was wont to embark upon the search for his wife\u2019s missing\nhandbag or his own spectacles when either of those essential articles\nwere mislaid.",
    "That is to say he went to the place where he had last seen\nthe missing objects and started from there.",
    "In this case the last thing known about Tommy was that he had dined\nwith Commander Haydock at Smugglers\u2019 Rest and had then returned to\nSans Souci and been last seen turning in at the gate.",
    "Albert accordingly climbed the hill as far as the gate of Sans Souci\nand spent some five minutes staring hopefully at the gate.",
    "Nothing of a\nscintillating character having occurred to him he sighed and wandered\nslowly up the hill to Smugglers\u2019 Rest.",
    "Albert too had visited the Ornate Cinema that week and had been\npowerfully impressed by the theme of Wandering Minstrel.",
    "Romantic it\nwas He could not but be struck by the similarity of his own\npredicament.",

    "A small amount of nose putty had altered the shape\nof the nose giving Tuppence an unexpectedly beaklike profile.",
    "Skilful\nmakeup had added several years to her age with heavy lines running\ndown each side of the mouth.",
    "The whole face had a complacent rather\nfoolish look.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s frightfully clever\u201d said Tuppence admiringly.",
    "She touched her\nnose gingerly.",
    "\u201cYou must be careful\u201d the other woman warned her.",
    "She produced\ntwo slices of thin india rubber.",
    "\u201cDo you think you could bear to wear\nthese in your cheeks\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I shall have to\u201d said Tuppence gloomily.",
    "She slipped them in and worked her jaws carefully.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not really too uncomfortable\u201d she had to admit.",
    "Tony then discreetly left the shed and Tuppence shed her own\nclothing and got into the nurse\u2019s kit.",
    "It was not too bad a fit though\ninclined to strain a little over the shoulders.",
    "The dark blue bonnet put the\nfinal touch to her new personality.",
    "She rejected however the stout\nsquaretoed shoes.",
    "\u201cIf I\u2019ve got to walk five miles\u201d she said decidedly \u201cI do it in my\nown shoes.\u201d\nThey both agreed that this was reasonable\u2014particularly as\nTuppence\u2019s own shoes were dark blue brogues that went well with the\nuniform.",
    "She looked with interest into the dark blue handbag\u2014powder no\nlipstick two pounds fourteen and sixpence in English money a\nhandkerchief and an identity card in the name of Freda Elton 4\nManchester Road Sheffield.",
    "Tuppence transferred her own powder and lipstick and stood up\nprepared to set out.",
    "Tony Marsdon turned his head away.",
    "He said gruffly\n\u201cI feel a swine letting you do this.\u201d\n\u201cI know just how you feel.\u201d\n\u201cBut you see it\u2019s absolutely vital\u2014that we should get some idea of\njust where and how the attack will come.\u201d\nTuppence patted him on the arm.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you worry my child.",
    "Believe it or not I\u2019m enjoying myself.\u201d\nTony Marsdon said again\n\u201cI think you\u2019re simply wonderful\u201d\n\nIII\n\n\fSomewhat weary Tuppence stood outside 14 St. Asalph\u2019s Road and\nnoted that Dr. Binion was a dental surgeon and not a doctor.",
    "From the corner of her eye she noted Tony Marsdon.",
    "He was sitting\nin a racylooking car outside a house farther down the street.",
    "It had been judged necessary for Tuppence to walk to Leatherbarrow\nexactly as instructed since if she had been driven there in a car the fact\nmight have been noted.",
    "It was certainly true that two enemy aircraft had passed over the\ndowns circling low before making off and they could have noted the\nnurse\u2019s lonely figure walking across country.",
    "Tony with the expert policewoman had driven off in the opposite\ndirection and had made a big detour before approaching Leatherbarrow\nand taking up his position in St. Asalph\u2019s Road.",
    "Everything was now set.",
    "\u201cThe arena doors open\u201d murmured Tuppence.",
    "\u201cEnter one Christian\nen route for the lions.",
    "Oh well nobody can say I\u2019m not seeing life.\u201d\nShe crossed the road and rang the bell wondering as she did so\nexactly how much Deborah liked that young man.",
    "The door was opened\nby an elderly woman with a stolid peasant face\u2014not an English face.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Binion\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "The woman looked her slowly up and down.",
    "\u201cYou will be Nurse Elton I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThen you will come up to the doctor\u2019s surgery.\u201d\nShe stood back the door closed behind Tuppence who found herself\nstanding in a narrow linoleumlined hall.",
    "The maid preceded her upstairs and opened a door on the first floor.",
    "\u201cPlease to wait.",
    "The doctor will come to you.\u201d\nShe went out shutting the door behind her.",
    "A very ordinary dentist\u2019s surgery\u2014the appointments somewhat old\nand shabby.",
    "Tuppence looked at the dentist\u2019s chair and smiled to think that for\nonce it held none of the usual terrors.",
    "She had the \u201cdentist feeling\u201d all\nright\u2014but from quite different causes.",
    "Presently the door would open and \u201cDr.",
    "Binion\u201d would come in.",
    "Who would Dr. Binion be A stranger Or someone she had seen before\n\n\fIf it was the person she was half expecting to see\u2014\nThe door opened.",
    "The man who entered was not at all the person Tuppence had half\nfancied she might see It was someone she had never considered as a\nlikely starter.",
    "It was Commander Haydock.",
    "Fourteen\n\nA flood of wild surmises as to the part Commander Haydock had\nplayed in Tommy\u2019s disappearance surged through Tuppence\u2019s brain but\nshe thrust them resolutely aside.",
    "This was a moment for keeping all her\nwits about her.",
    "Would or would not the Commander recognise her It was an\ninteresting question.",
    "She had so steeled herself beforehand to display no recognition or\nsurprise herself no matter whom she might see that she felt reasonably\nsure that she herself had displayed no signs untoward to the situation.",
    "She rose now to her feet and stood there standing in a respectable\nattitude as befitted a mere German woman in the presence of a Lord of\ncreation.",
    "\u201cSo you have arrived\u201d said the Commander.",
    "He spoke in English and his manner was precisely the same as usual.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Tuppence and added as though presenting her\ncredentials \u201cNurse Elton.\u201d\nHaydock smiled as though at a joke.",
    "\u201cNurse Elton Excellent.\u201d\nHe looked at her approvingly.",
    "\u201cYou look absolutely right\u201d he said kindly.",
    "Tuppence inclined her head but said nothing.",
    "She was leaving the\ninitiative to him.",
    "\u201cYou know I suppose what you have to do\u201d went on Haydock.",
    "\u201cSit\ndown please.\u201d\nTuppence sat down obediently.",
    "She replied\n\n\f\u201cI was to take detailed instructions from you.\u201d\n\u201cVery proper\u201d said Haydock.",
    "There was a faint suggestion of\nmockery in his voice.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou know the day\u201d\n\u201cThe fourth.\u201d\nHaydock looked startled.",
    "A heavy frown creased his forehead.",
    "\u201cSo you know that do you\u201d he muttered.",
    "There was a pause then Tuppence said\n\u201cYou will tell me please what I have to do\u201d\nHaydock said\n\u201cAll in good time my dear.\u201d\nHe paused a minute and then asked\n\u201cYou have heard no doubt of Sans Souci\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tuppence firmly.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s see how you deal with this one\u201d she thought.",
    "There was a queer smile on the Commander\u2019s face.",
    "He said\n\u201cSo you haven\u2019t heard of Sans Souci That surprises me very much\n\u2014since I was under the impression you know that you\u2019d been living\nthere for the last month . . .\u201d\nThere was a dead silence.",
    "The Commander said\n\u201cWhat about that Mrs. Blenkensop\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean Dr. Binion.",
    "I landed by parachute this\nmorning.\u201d\nAgain Haydock smiled\u2014definitely an unpleasant smile.",
    "He said\n\u201cA few yards of canvas thrust into a bush create a wonderful illusion.",
    "And I am not Dr. Binion dear lady.",
    "Dr. Binion is officially my dentist\u2014\nhe is good enough to lend me his surgery now and again.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIndeed Mrs. Blenkensop Or perhaps you would prefer me to\naddress you by your real name of Beresford\u201d\nAgain there was a poignant silence.",
    "Tuppence drew a deep breath.",
    "Haydock nodded.",
    "\u201cThe game\u2019s up you see.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve walked into my parlour\u2019 said the\nspider to the fly.\u201d\nThere was a faint click and a gleam of blue steel showed in his hand.",
    "His voice took on a grim note as he said\n\u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t advise you to make any noise or try to arouse the\nneighbourhood You\u2019d be dead before you got so much as a yelp out and\neven if you did manage to scream it wouldn\u2019t arouse attention.",
    "Patients\nunder gas you know often cry out.\u201d\nTuppence said composedly\n\u201cYou seem to have thought of everything.",
    "Has it occurred to you that\nI have friends who know where I am\u201d\n\u201cAh Still harping on the blueeyed boy\u2014actually browneyed\nYoung Anthony Marsdon.",
    "I\u2019m sorry Mrs. Beresford but young Anthony\nhappens to be one of our most stalwart supporters in this country.",
    "As I\nsaid just now a few yards of canvas creates a wonderful effect.",
    "You\nswallowed the parachute idea quite easily.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the point of all this rigmarole\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you We don\u2019t want your friends to trace you too easily you\nsee.",
    "If they pick up your trail it will lead to Yarrow and to a man in a car.",
    "The fact that a hospital nurse of quite different facial appearance\nwalked into Leatherbarrow between one and two will hardly be\nconnected with your disappearance.\u201d\n\u201cVery elaborate\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "Haydock said\n\u201cI admire your nerve you know.",
    "I admire it very much.",
    "I\u2019m sorry to\nhave to coerce you\u2014but it\u2019s vital that we should know just exactly how\nmuch you did discover at Sans Souci.\u201d\nTuppence did not answer.",
    "Haydock said quietly\n\u201cI\u2019d advise you you know to come clean.",
    "There are certain\u2014\npossibilities\u2014in a dentist\u2019s chair and instruments.\u201d\nTuppence merely threw him a scornful look.",
    "Haydock leant back in his chair.",
    "He said slowly\n\n\f\u201cYes\u2014I dare say you\u2019ve got a lot of fortitude\u2014your type often has.",
    "But what about the other half of the picture\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about Thomas Beresford your husband who has lately\nbeen living at Sans Souci under the name of Mr. Meadowes and who is\nnow very conveniently trussed up in the cellar of my house.\u201d\nTuppence said sharply\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u201cBecause of the Penny Plain letter Don\u2019t you realise that that was\njust a smart bit of work on the part of young Anthony.",
    "You played into\nhis hands nicely when you gave him the code.\u201d\nTuppence\u2019s voice trembled.",
    "\u201cThen Tommy\u2014then Tommy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTommy\u201d said Commander Haydock \u201cis where he has been all\nalong\u2014completely in my power It\u2019s up to you now.",
    "If you answer my\nquestions satisfactorily there\u2019s a chance for him.",
    "If you don\u2019t\u2014well the\noriginal plan holds.",
    "He\u2019ll be knocked on the head taken out to sea and\nput overboard.\u201d\nTuppence was silent for a minute or two\u2014then she said\n\u201cWhat do you want to know\u201d\n\u201cI want to know who employed you what your means of\ncommunication with that person or persons are what you have reported\nso far and exactly what you know\u201d\nTuppence shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cI could tell you what lies I choose\u201d she pointed out.",
    "\u201cNo because I shall proceed to test what you say.\u201d He drew his chair\na little nearer.",
    "His manner was now definitely appealing.",
    "\u201cMy dear\nwoman\u2014I know just what you feel about it all but believe me when I\nsay I really do admire both you and your husband immensely.",
    "You\u2019ve got\ngrit and pluck.",
    "It\u2019s people like you that will be needed in the new State\u2014\nthe State that will arise in this country when your present imbecile\nGovernment is vanquished.",
    "We want to turn some of our enemies into\nfriends\u2014those that are worthwhile.",
    "If I have to give the order that ends\nyour husband\u2019s life I shall do it\u2014it\u2019s my duty\u2014but I shall feel really\nbadly about having to do it He\u2019s a fine fellow\u2014quiet unassuming and\n\n\fclever.",
    "Let me impress upon you what so few people in this country seem\nto understand.",
    "Our Leader does not intend to conquer this country in the\nsense that you all think.",
    "He aims at creating a new Britain\u2014a Britain\nstrong in its own power\u2014ruled over not by Germans but by\nEnglishmen.",
    "And the best type of Englishmen\u2014Englishmen with brains\nand breeding and courage.",
    "A brave new world as Shakespeare puts it.\u201d\nHe leaned forward.",
    "\u201cWe want to do away with muddle and inefficiency.",
    "With bribery and\ncorruption.",
    "With selfseeking and moneygrabbing\u2014and in this new\nstate we want people like you and your husband\u2014brave and resourceful\n\u2014enemies that have been friends to be.",
    "You would be surprised if you\nknew how many there are in this country as in others who have\nsympathy with and belief in our aims.",
    "Between us all we will create a\nnew Europe\u2014a Europe of peace and progress.",
    "Try and see it that way\u2014\nbecause I assure you\u2014it is that way . . .\u201d\nHis voice was compelling magnetic.",
    "Leaning forward he looked the\nembodiment of a straightforward British sailor.",
    "Tuppence looked at him and searched her mind for a telling phrase.",
    "She was only able to find one that was both childish and rude.",
    "\u201cGoosey goosey gander\u201d said Tuppence. . . .\n\nII\nThe effect was so magical that she was quite taken aback.",
    "Haydock jumped to his feet his face went dark purple with rage and\nin a second all likeness to a hearty British sailor had vanished.",
    "She saw\nwhat Tommy had once seen\u2014an infuriated Prussian.",
    "He swore at her fluently in German.",
    "Then changing to English he\nshouted\n\u201cYou infernal little fool Don\u2019t you realise you give yourself away\ncompletely answering like that You\u2019ve done for yourself now\u2014you and\nyour precious husband.\u201d\nRaising his voice he called\n\u201cAnna\u201d\n\n\fThe woman who had admitted Tuppence came into the room.",
    "Haydock thrust the pistol into her hand.",
    "\u201cWatch her.",
    "Shoot if necessary.\u201d\nHe stormed out of the room.",
    "Tuppence looked appealingly at Anna who stood in front of her with\nan impassive face.",
    "\u201cWould you really shoot me\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "Anna answered quietly\n\u201cYou need not try to get round me.",
    "In the last war my son was killed\nmy Otto.",
    "I was thirtyeight then\u2014I am sixtytwo now\u2014but I have not\nforgotten.\u201d\nTuppence looked at the broad impassive face.",

    "That same frightening ferocity and\nsingleness of purpose.",
    "Motherhood\u2014unrelenting So no doubt felt\nmany quiet Mrs. Joneses and Mrs. Smiths all over England.",
    "There was\nno arguing with the female of the species\u2014the mother deprived of her\nyoung.",
    "Something stirred in the recesses of Tuppence\u2019s brain\u2014some\nnagging recollection\u2014something that she had always known but had\nnever succeeded in getting into the forefront of her mind.",
    "Solomon\u2014\nSolomon came into it somewhere. . . .",
    "The door opened.",
    "Commander Haydock came back into the room.",
    "He howled out beside himself with rage\n\u201cWhere is it Where have you hidden it\u201d\nTuppence stared at him.",
    "She was completely taken aback.",
    "What he\nwas saying did not make sense to her.",
    "She had taken nothing and hidden nothing.",
    "Haydock said to Anna\n\u201cGet out.\u201d\nThe woman handed the pistol to him and left the room promptly.",
    "Haydock dropped into a chair and seemed to be striving to pull\nhimself together.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get away with it you know.",
    "I\u2019ve got you\u2014and I\u2019ve got\nways of making people speak\u2014not pretty ways.",
    "You\u2019ll have to tell the\ntruth in the end.",
    "Now then what have you done with it\u201d\n\n\fTuppence was quick to see that here at least was something that\ngave her the possibility of bargaining.",
    "If only she could find out what it\nwas she was supposed to have in her possession.",
    "She said cautiously\n\u201cHow do you know I\u2019ve got it\u201d\n\u201cFrom what you said you damned little fool.",
    "You haven\u2019t got it on\nyou\u2014that we know since you changed completely into this kit.\u201d\n\u201cSuppose I posted it to someone\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool.",
    "Everything you posted since yesterday has been\nexamined.",
    "You didn\u2019t post it.",
    "No there\u2019s only one thing you could have\ndone.",
    "Hidden it in Sans Souci before you left this morning.",

    "\u201cThree minutes Mrs. Thomas Beresford.\u201d\nThe clock on the mantelpiece ticked.",
    "Tuppence sat quite still with a blank impassive face.",
    "It revealed nothing of the racing thoughts behind it.",
    "In a flash of bewildering light she saw everything\u2014saw the whole\nbusiness revealed in terms of blinding clarity and realised at last who\nwas the centre and pivot of the whole organisation.",
    "It came quite as a shock to her when Haydock said\n\u201cTen seconds more . . .\u201d\nLike one in a dream she watched him saw the pistol arm rise heard\nhim count\n\u201cOne two three four five\u2014\u201d\nHe had reached eight when the shot rang out and he collapsed\nforward on his chair an expression of bewilderment on his broad red\nface.",
    "So intent had he been on watching his victim that he had been\nunaware of the door behind him slowly opening.",
    "In a flash Tuppence was on her feet.",
    "She pushed her way past the\nuniformed men in the doorway and seized on a tweedclad arm.",

    "If only we\u2019re in\ntime.",
    "Before they telephone here and get no answer.\u201d\nTwo minutes later they were in the car and it was threading its way\nthrough the streets of Leatherbarrow.",
    "Then they were out in the open\ncountry and the needle of the speedometer was rising.",
    "Mr. Grant asked no questions.",
    "He was content to sit quietly whilst\nTuppence watched the speedometer in an agony of apprehension.",
    "The\nchauffeur had been given his orders and he drove with all the speed of\nwhich the car was capable.",
    "Tuppence only spoke once.",
    "\u201cTommy\u201d\n\u201cQuite all right.",
    "Released half an hour ago.\u201d\nShe nodded.",

    "The room was empty.",
    "It looked peaceful and smelt slightly of\nmedicines.",
    "Tuppence ran across to the bed and pulled at the coverings.",

    "And she ran out into the drive\nand laid in wait for you with the hammer.",
    "She was only away from the\nbridge table for about three minutes.",
    "I did notice she was a little out of\nbreath\u2014but I never suspected her.\u201d\n\u201cAfter that\u201d said Tommy \u201cthe credit belongs entirely to Albert.",

    "Then I was just cooking up a plan with Albert when suddenly out of the\nblue Anthony Marsdon turned up.",
    "It seemed all right to begin with\u2014the\nusual sort of young man that Deb often has in tow.",
    "But two things made\nme think a bit.",
    "First I became more and more sure as I talked to him that\nI hadn\u2019t seen him before and that he never had been to the flat.",
    "The\nsecond was that though he seemed to know all about my working at\nLeahampton he assumed that Tommy was in Scotland.",
    "Now that seemed\nall wrong.",
    "If he knew about anyone it would be Tommy he knew about\nsince I was more or less unofficial.",
    "That struck me as very odd.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Grant had told me that Fifth Columnists were everywhere\u2014in\nthe most unlikely places.",
    "So why shouldn\u2019t one of them be working in\nDeborah\u2019s show I wasn\u2019t convinced but I was suspicious enough to lay\na trap for him.",
    "I told him that Tommy and I had fixed up a code for\ncommunicating with each other.",
    "Our real one of course was a Bonzo\npostcard but I told Anthony a fairy tale about the Penny plain tuppence\ncoloured saying.",
    "\u201cAs I hoped he rose to it beautifully I got a letter this morning\nwhich gave him away completely.",
    "\u201cThe arrangements had been all worked out beforehand.",
    "All I had to\ndo was to ring up a tailor and cancel a fitting.",
    "That was an intimation that\nthe fish had risen.\u201d\n\u201cCooer\u201d said Albert.",
    "\u201cIt didn\u2019t half give me a turn.",
    "I drove up with\na baker\u2019s van and we dumped a pool of stuff just outside the gate.",
    "Aniseed it was\u2014or smelt like it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then\u2014\u201d Tuppence took up the tale.",
    "\u201cI came out and walked in\nit.",
    "Of course it was easy for the baker\u2019s van to follow me to the station\n\n\fand someone came up behind me and heard me book to Yarrow.",
    "It was\nafter that that it might have been difficult.\u201d\n\u201cThe dogs followed the scent well\u201d said Mr. Grant.",
    "\u201cThey picked it\nup at Yarrow station and again on the track the tyre had made after you\nrubbed your shoe on it.",
    "It led us down to the copse and up again to the\nstone cross and after you where you had walked over the downs.",
    "The\nenemy had no idea we could follow you easily after they themselves had\nseen you start and driven off themselves.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same\u201d said Albert \u201cit gave me a turn.",
    "Knowing you were in\nthat house and not knowing what might come to you.",
    "Got in a back\nwindow we did and nabbed the foreign woman as she came down the\nstairs.",
    "Come in just in the nick of time we did.\u201d\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d come\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cThe thing was for me to spin\nthings out as long as I could.",
    "I\u2019d have pretended to tell if I hadn\u2019t seen\nthe door opening.",
    "What was really exciting was the way I suddenly saw\nthe whole thing and what a fool I\u2019d been.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you see it\u201d asked Tommy.",
    "\u201cGoosey goosey gander\u201d said Tuppence promptly.",
    "\u201cWhen I said\nthat to Commander Haydock he went absolutely livid.",
    "And not just\nbecause it was silly and rude.",
    "No I saw at once that it meant something\nto him.",
    "And then there was the expression on that woman\u2019s face\u2014Anna\n\u2014it was like the Polish woman\u2019s and then of course I thought of\nSolomon and I saw the whole thing.\u201d\nTommy gave a sigh of exasperation.",
    "\u201cTuppence if you say that once again I\u2019ll shoot you myself.",
    "Saw all\nwhat And what on earth has Solomon got to do with it\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember that two women came to Solomon with a baby\nand both said it was hers but Solomon said \u2018Very well cut it in two.\u2019\nAnd the false mother said \u2018All right.\u2019 But the real mother said \u2018No let\nthe other woman have it.\u2019 You see she couldn\u2019t face her child being\nkilled.",
    "Well that night that Mrs. Sprot shot the other woman you all said\nwhat a miracle it was and how easily she might have shot the child.",
    "Of\ncourse it ought to have been quite plain then If it had been her child\nshe couldn\u2019t have risked that shot for a minute.",
    "It meant that Betty wasn\u2019t\nher child.",
    "And that\u2019s why she absolutely had to shoot the other woman.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhy\u201d\n\u201cBecause of course the other woman was the child\u2019s real mother.\u201d\nTuppence\u2019s voice shook a little.",
    "\u201cPoor thing\u2014poor hunted thing.",
    "She came over a penniless refugee\nand gratefully agreed to let Mrs. Sprot adopt her baby.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did Mrs. Sprot want to adopt the child\u201d\n\u201cCamouflage Supreme psychological camouflage.",
    "You just can\u2019t\nconceive of a master spy dragging her kid into the business.",
    "That\u2019s the\nmain reason why I never considered Mrs. Sprot seriously.",
    "Simply\nbecause of the child.",
    "But Betty\u2019s real mother had a terrible hankering for\nher baby and she found out Mrs. Sprot\u2019s address and came down here.",
    "She hung about waiting for her chance and at last she got it and went off\nwith the child.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Sprot of course was frantic.",
    "At all costs she didn\u2019t want the\npolice.",
    "So she wrote that message and pretended she found it in her\nbedroom and roped in Commander Haydock to help.",
    "Then when we\u2019d\ntracked down the wretched woman she was taking no chances and shot\nher .",
    ". . Far from not knowing anything about firearms she was a very\nfine shot Yes she killed that wretched woman\u2014and because of that I\u2019ve\nno pity for her.",
    "She was bad through and through.\u201d\nTuppence paused then she went on\n\u201cAnother thing that ought to have given me a hint was the likeness\nbetween Vanda Polonska and Betty.",
    "It was Betty the woman reminded\nme of all along.",
    "And then the child\u2019s absurd play with my shoelaces.",
    "How much more likely that she\u2019d seen her socalled mother do that\u2014not\nCarl von Deinim But as soon as Mrs. Sprot saw what the child was\ndoing she planted a lot of evidence in Carl\u2019s room for us to find and\nadded the master touch of a shoelace dipped in secret ink.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that Carl wasn\u2019t in it\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI liked him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not been shot has he\u201d asked Tuppence anxiously noting the\npast tense.",
    "Mr. Grant shook his head.",

    "\u201cAs a matter of fact I\u2019ve got a little surprise\nfor you there.\u201d\nTuppence\u2019s face lit up as she said\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019m terribly glad\u2014for Sheila\u2019s sake Of course we were idiots to go\non barking up the wrong tree after Mrs. Perenna.\u201d\n\u201cShe was mixed up in some IRA activities nothing more\u201d said Mr.\nGrant.",

    "\u201cA very dangerous woman\nand a very clever actress.",
