    "Evidently their Mr. Cade had met an old friend.",
    "They all admired\nMr. Cade so much his tall lean figure his suntanned face the\nlighthearted manner with which he settled disputes and cajoled\nthem all into good temper.",
    "This friend of his now\u2014surely rather a\npeculiarlooking man.",
    "About the same height as Mr. Cade but thickset\nand not nearly so goodlooking.",
    "The sort of man one read about in\nbooks who probably kept a saloon.",
    "Interesting though.",
    "After all that\nwas what one came abroad for\u2014to see all these peculiar things one read\nabout in books.",
    "Up to now they had been rather bored with Bulawayo.",
    "The sun was unbearably hot the hotel was uncomfortable there seemed\nto be nowhere particular to go until the moment should arrive to motor\nto the Matoppos.",
    "Very fortunately Mr. Cade had suggested picture\npostcards.",
    "There was an excellent supply of picture postcards.",
    "Anthony Cade and his friend had stepped a little apart.",
    "\u201cWhat the hell are you doing with this pack of females\u201d demanded\nMcGrath.",
    "\u201cStarting a harem.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot with this little lot\u201d grinned Anthony.",
    "\u201cHave you taken a good\nlook at them\u201d\n\n\u201cI have that.",
    "Thought maybe you were losing your eyesight.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy eyesight\u2019s as good as ever it was.",
    "No this is a Castle\u2019s Select\nTour.",
    "I\u2019m Castle\u2014the local Castle I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the hell made you take on a job like that\u201d\n\n\u201cA regrettable necessity for cash.",
    "I can assure you it doesn\u2019t suit my\ntemperament.\u201d\n\nJimmy grinned.",
    "\u201cNever a hog for regular work were you\u201d\n\nAnthony ignored this aspersion.",
    "\u201cHowever something will turn up soon I expect\u201d he remarked\nhopefully.",
    "\u201cIt usually does.\u201d\n\nJimmy chuckled.",
    "\u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble brewing Anthony Cade is sure to be in it\nsooner or later I know that\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve an absolute instinct\nfor rows\u2014and the nine lives of a cat.",
    "When can we have a yarn\ntogether\u201d\n\nAnthony sighed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got to take these cackling hens to see Rhodes\u2019s grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the stuff\u201d said Jimmy approvingly.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019ll come back bumped\nblack and blue with the ruts in the road and clamouring for bed\nto rest the bruises on.",
    "Then you and I will have a spot or two and\nexchange the news.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.",
    "So long Jimmy.\u201d\n\nAnthony rejoined his flock of sheep.",
    "Miss Taylor the youngest and most\nskittish of the party instantly attacked him.",
    "\u201cOh Mr. Cade was that an old friend of yours\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was Miss Taylor.",
    "One of the friends of my blameless youth.\u201d\n\nMiss Taylor giggled.",
    "\u201cI thought he was such an interestinglooking man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you said so.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Mr. Cade how can you be so naughty The very idea What was that\nname he called you\u201d\n\n\u201cGentleman Joe\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Is your name Joe\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you knew it was Anthony Miss Taylor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh go on with you\u201d cried Miss Taylor coquettishly.",
    "Anthony had by now well mastered his duties.",
    "In addition to making the\nnecessary arrangements of travel they included soothing down irritable\nold gentlemen when their dignity was ruffled seeing that elderly\nmatrons had ample opportunities to buy picture postcards and flirting\nwith everything under a catholic forty years of age.",
    "The last task\nwas rendered easier for him by the extreme readiness of the ladies in\nquestion to read a tender meaning into his most innocent remarks.",
    "Miss Taylor returned to the attack.",
    "\u201cWhy does he call you Joe then\u201d\n\n\u201cOh just because it isn\u2019t my name.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why Gentleman Joe\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same kind of reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Mr. Cade\u201d protested Miss Taylor much distressed \u201cI\u2019m sure you\nshouldn\u2019t say that.",
    "Papa was only saying last night what gentlemanly\nmanners you had.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery kind of your father I\u2019m sure Miss Taylor.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we are all agreed that you are quite the gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo really I mean it.\u201d\n\n\u201cKind hearts are more than coronets\u201d said Anthony vaguely without a\nnotion of what he meant by the remark and wishing fervently it was\nlunch time.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s such a beautiful poem I always think.",
    "Do you know much poetry\nMr. Cade\u201d\n\n\u201cI might recite \u2018The boy stood on the burning deck\u2019 at a pinch.",
    "\u2018The\nboy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled.\u2019 That\u2019s all\nI know but I can do that bit with action if you like.",
    "\u2018The boy stood\non the burning deck\u2019\u2014whoosh\u2014whoosh\u2014whoosh\u2014the flames you see\n\u2018Whence all but he had fled\u2019\u2014for that bit I run to and fro like a dog.\u201d\n\nMiss Taylor screamed with laughter.",
    "\u201cOh do look at Mr. Cade Isn\u2019t he funny\u201d\n\n\u201cTime for morning tea\u201d said Anthony briskly.",
    "\u201cCome this way.",
    "There is\nan excellent caf\u00e9 in the next street.\u201d\n\n\u201cI presume\u201d said Mrs. Caldicott in her deep voice \u201cthat the expense\nis included in the Tour\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning tea Mrs. Caldicott\u201d said Anthony assuming his professional\nmanner \u201cis an extra.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisgraceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is full of trials isn\u2019t it\u201d said Anthony cheerfully.",
    "Mrs.\nCaldicott\u2019s eyes gleamed and she remarked with the air of one\nspringing a mine\n\n\u201cI suspected as much and in anticipation I poured off some tea into a\njug at breakfast this morning I can heat that up on the spirit lamp.",
    "Come father.\u201d\n\nMr. and Mrs. Caldicott sailed off triumphantly to the hotel the lady\u2019s\nback complacent with successful forethought.",
    "\u201cOh Lord\u201d muttered Anthony \u201cwhat a lot of funny people it does take\nto make a world.\u201d\n\nHe marshalled the rest of the party in the direction of the caf\u00e9.",
    "Miss\nTaylor kept by his side and resumed her catechism.",
    "\u201cIs it a long time since you saw your friend\u201d\n\n\u201cJust over seven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it in Africa you knew him\u201d\n\n\u201cYes not this part though.",
    "The first time I ever saw Jimmy McGrath he\nwas all trussed up ready for the cooking pot.",
    "Some of the tribes in the\ninterior are cannibals you know.",
    "We got there just in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened\u201d\n\n\u201cVery nice little shindy.",
    "We potted some of the beggars and the rest\ntook to their heels.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Mr. Cade what an adventurous life you must have led\u201d\n\n\u201cVery peaceful I assure you.\u201d\n\nBut it was clear that the lady did not believe him.",
    "It was about ten o\u2019clock that night when Anthony Cade walked into the\nsmall room where Jimmy McGrath was busy manipulating various bottles.",
    "\u201cMake it strong James\u201d he implored.",
    "\u201cI can tell you I need it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should think you did my boy.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t take on that job of yours\nfor anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow me another and I\u2019ll jump out of it fast enough.\u201d\n\nMcGrath poured out his own drink tossed it off with a practised hand\nand mixed a second one.",
    "Then he said slowly\n\n\u201cAre you in earnest about that old son\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what\u201d\n\n\u201cChucking this job of yours if you could get another\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy You don\u2019t mean to say that you\u2019ve got a job going begging Why\ndon\u2019t you grab it yourself\u201d\n\n\u201cI have grabbed it\u2014but I don\u2019t much fancy it that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to\npass it on to you.\u201d\n\nAnthony became suspicious.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it They haven\u2019t engaged you to teach in a Sunday\nschool have they\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think anyone would choose me to teach in a Sunday school\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if they knew you well certainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly good job\u2014nothing wrong with it whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in South America by any lucky chance I\u2019ve rather got my eye on\nSouth America.",
    "There\u2019s a very tidy little revolution coming off in one\nof those little republics soon.\u201d\n\nMcGrath grinned.",
    "\u201cYou always were keen on revolutions\u2014anything to be mixed up in a\nreally good row.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel my talents might be appreciated out there.",
    "I tell you Jimmy\nI can be jolly useful in a revolution\u2014to one side or the other.",
    "It\u2019s\nbetter than making an honest living any day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard that sentiment from you before my son.",
    "No the job\nisn\u2019t in South America\u2014it\u2019s in England.\u201d\n\n\u201cEngland Return of hero to his native land after many long years.",
    "They\ncan\u2019t dun you for bills after seven years can they Jimmy\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.",
    "Well are you on for hearing more about it\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on all right.",
    "The thing that worries me is why you\u2019re not taking\nit on yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you.",
    "I\u2019m after gold Anthony\u2014far up in the interior.\u201d\n\nAnthony whistled and looked at him.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve always been after gold Jimmy ever since I knew you.",
    "It\u2019s your\nweak spot\u2014your own particular little hobby.",
    "You\u2019ve followed up more\nwildcat trails than anyone I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in the end I\u2019ll strike it.",
    "You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell every one his own hobby.",
    "Mine\u2019s rows yours is gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole story.",
    "I suppose you know all about\nHerzoslovakia\u201d\n\nAnthony looked up sharply.",
    "\u201cHerzoslovakia\u201d he said with a curious ring in his voice.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Know anything about it\u201d\n\nThere was quite an appreciable pause before Anthony answered.",
    "Then he\nsaid slowly\n\n\u201cOnly what every one knows.",
    "It\u2019s one of the Balkan States isn\u2019t it\nPrincipal rivers unknown.",
    "Principal mountains also unknown but\nfairly numerous.",

    "Population chiefly brigands.",
    "Hobby\nassassinating Kings and having Revolutions.",
    "Last King Nicholas IV.",
    "Assassinated about seven years ago.",
    "Since then it\u2019s been a Republic.",
    "Altogether a very likely spot.",
    "You might have mentioned before that\nHerzoslovakia came into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t except indirectly.\u201d\n\nAnthony gazed at him more in sorrow than in anger.",
    "\u201cYou ought to do something about this James\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cTake a\ncorrespondence course or something.",
    "If you\u2019d told a story like this in\nthe good old Eastern days you\u2019d have been hung up by the heels and\nbastinadoed or something equally unpleasant.\u201d\n\nJimmy pursued his course quite unmoved by these strictures.",
    "\u201cEver heard of Count Stylptitch\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re talking\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cMany people who have never heard\nof Herzoslovakia would brighten at the mention of Count Stylptitch.",
    "The Grand Old Man of the Balkans.",
    "The Greatest Statesman of Modern\nTimes.",
    "The biggest Villain unhung.",
    "The point of view all depends on\nwhich newspaper you take in.",
    "But be sure of this Count Stylptitch will\nbe remembered long after you and I are dust and ashes James.",
    "Every\nmove and counter move in the Near East for the last twenty years has\nhad Count Stylptitch at the bottom of it.",
    "He\u2019s been a dictator and a\npatriot and a statesman\u2014and nobody knows exactly what he has been\nexcept that he\u2019s been a perfect King of intrigue.",
    "Well what about him\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was Prime Minister of Herzoslovakia\u2014that\u2019s why I mentioned it\nfirst.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no sense of proportion Jimmy.",
    "Herzoslovakia is of no\nimportance at all compared to Stylptitch.",
    "It just provided him with a\nbirthplace and a post in public affairs.",
    "But I thought he was dead\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he is.",
    "He died in Paris about two months ago.",
    "What I\u2019m telling you\nabout happened some years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is\u201d said Anthony \u201cwhat are you telling me about\u201d\n\nJimmy accepted the rebuke and hastened on.",
    "\u201cIt was like this.",
    "I was in Paris\u2014just four years ago to be exact.",
    "I\nwas walking along one night in rather a lonely part when I saw half a\ndozen French toughs beating up a respectablelooking old gentleman.",
    "I\nhate a onesided show so I promptly butted in and proceeded to beat\nup the toughs.",
    "I guess they\u2019d never been hit really hard before.",
    "They\nmelted like snow\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for you James\u201d said Anthony softly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d like to have seen that\nscrap.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it was nothing much\u201d said Jimmy modestly.",
    "\u201cBut the old boy was\nno end grateful.",
    "He\u2019d had a couple no doubt about that but he was\nsober enough to get my name and address out of me and he came along\nand thanked me next day.",
    "Did the thing in style too.",
    "It was then that I\nfound out it was Count Stylptitch I\u2019d rescued.",
    "He\u2019d got a house up by\nthe Bois.\u201d\n\nAnthony nodded.",
    "\u201cYes Stylptitch went to live in Paris after the assassination of King\nNicholas.",
    "They wanted him to come back and be President later but he\nwasn\u2019t taking any.",
    "He remained sound to his Monarchical principals\nthough he was reported to have his finger in all the backstairs pies\nthat went on in the Balkans.",
    "Very deep the late Count Stylptitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicholas IV was the man who had a funny taste in wives wasn\u2019t he\u201d\nsaid Jimmy suddenly.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cAnd it did for him too poor beggar.",
    "She was some\nlittle guttersnipe of a music hall artiste in Paris\u2014not even suitable\nfor a morganatic alliance.",
    "But Nicholas had a frightful crush on her\nand she was all out for being a Queen.",
    "Sounds fantastic but they\nmanaged it somehow.",
    "Called her the Countess Popoffsky or something\nand pretended she had Romanoff blood in her veins.",
    "Nicholas married her\nin the Cathedral at Ekarest with a couple of unwilling Archbishops to\ndo the job and she was crowned as Queen Varaga.",
    "Nicholas squared his\nMinisters and I suppose he thought that was all that mattered\u2014but\nhe forgot to reckon with the populace.",
    "They\u2019re very aristocratic and\nreactionary in Herzoslovakia.",
    "They like their Kings and Queens to be\nthe genuine article.",
    "There were mutterings and discontent and the\nusual ruthless suppressions and the final uprising which stormed the\nPalace murdered the King and Queen and proclaimed a Republic.",
    "It\u2019s\nbeen a Republic ever since\u2014but things still manage to be pretty lively\nthere so I\u2019ve heard.",
    "They\u2019ve assassinated a President or two just to\nkeep their hand in.",
    "But revenons \u00e0 nos moutons.",
    "You had got to where\nCount Stylptitch was hailing you as his preserver.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Well that was the end of that business.",
    "I came back to\nAfrica and never thought of it again until about two weeks ago I\ngot a queerlooking parcel which had been following me all over the\nplace for the Lord knows how long.",
    "I\u2019d seen in a paper that Count\nStylptitch had recently died in Paris.",
    "Well this parcel contained his\nMemoirs\u2014or Reminiscences or whatever you call the things.",
    "There was\na note enclosed to the effect that if I delivered the manuscript at a\ncertain firm of publishers in London on or before October 13 they were\ninstructed to hand me a thousand pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cA thousand pounds Did you say a thousand pounds Jimmy\u201d\n\n\u201cI did my son.",
    "I hope to God it\u2019s not a hoax.",
    "Put not your trust in\nPrinces or Politicians as the saying goes.",
    "Well there it is.",
    "Owing\nto the way the manuscript had been following me around I had no time\nto lose.",
    "It was a pity all the same.",
    "I\u2019d just fixed up this trip to\nthe interior and I\u2019d set my heart on going.",
    "I shan\u2019t get such a good\nchance again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re incurable Jimmy.",
    "A thousand pounds in the hand is worth a lot\nof mythical gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd supposing it\u2019s all a hoax Anyway here I am passage booked and\neverything on the way to Cape Town\u2014and then you blow along\u201d\n\nAnthony got up and lit a cigarette.",
    "\u201cI begin to perceive your drift James.",
    "You go gold hunting as planned\nand I collect the thousand pounds for you.",
    "How much do I get out of it\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say to a quarter\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo hundred and fifty pounds free of income tax as the saying goes\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone and just to make you gnash your teeth I\u2019ll tell you that I would\nhave gone for a hundred Let me tell you James McGrath you won\u2019t\ndie in your bed counting up your bank balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway it\u2019s a deal\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal all right.",
    "I\u2019m on.",
    "And confusion to Castle\u2019s Select Tours.\u201d\n\nThey drank the toast solemnly.",
    "2\n\nA Lady in Distress\n\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s that\u201d said Anthony finishing off his glass and replacing\nit on the table.",
    "\u201cWhat boat were you going on\u201d\n\n\u201cGranarth Castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cPassage booked in your name I suppose so I\u2019d better travel as James\nMcGrath.",
    "We\u2019ve outgrown the passport business haven\u2019t we\u201d\n\n\u201cNo odds either way.",
    "You and I are totally unlike but we\u2019d probably\nhave the same description on one of those blinking things.",
    "Height 6\nfeet hair brown eyes blue nose ordinary chin ordinary\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so much of this \u2018ordinary\u2019 stunt.",
    "Let me tell you that Castle\u2019s\nselected me out of several applicants solely on account of my pleasing\nappearance and nice manners.\u201d\n\nJimmy grinned.",
    "\u201cI noticed your manners this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe devil you did.\u201d\n\nAnthony rose and paced up and down the room.",
    "His brow was slightly\nwrinkled and it was some minutes before he spoke.",
    "\u201cJimmy\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cStylptitch died in Paris.",
    "What\u2019s the point\nof sending a manuscript from Paris to London via Africa\u201d\n\nJimmy shook his head helplessly.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not do it up in a nice little parcel and send it by post\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds a damn sight more sensible I agree.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course\u201d continued Anthony \u201cI know that Kings and Queens and\nGovernment officials are prevented by etiquette from doing anything\nin a simple straightforward fashion.",
    "Hence King\u2019s Messengers and all\nthat.",
    "In medieval days you gave a fellow a signet ring as a sort of\nOpen Sesame.",
    "\u2018The King\u2019s Ring Pass my Lord\u2019 And usually it was the\nother fellow who had stolen it.",
    "I always wonder why some bright lad\nnever hit on the expedient of copying the ring\u2014making a dozen or so\nand selling them at a hundred ducats apiece.",
    "They seem to have had no\ninitiative in the Middle Ages.\u201d\n\nJimmy yawned.",
    "\u201cMy remarks on the Middle Ages don\u2019t seem to amuse you.",
    "Let us get back\nto Count Stylptitch.",
    "From France to England via Africa seems a bit\nthick even for a diplomatic personage.",
    "If he merely wanted to ensure\nthat you should get a thousand pounds he could have left it you in his\nwill.",
    "Thank God neither you nor I are too proud to accept a legacy\nStylptitch must have been balmy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think so wouldn\u2019t you\u201d\n\nAnthony frowned and continued his pacing.",
    "\u201cHave you read the thing at all\u201d he asked suddenly.",
    "\u201cRead what\u201d\n\n\u201cThe manuscript.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Lord no.",
    "What do you think I want to read a thing of that kind\nfor\u201d\n\nAnthony smiled.",
    "\u201cI just wondered that\u2019s all.",
    "You know a lot of trouble has been\ncaused by Memoirs.",
    "Indiscreet revelations that sort of thing.",
    "People\nwho have been closed as an oyster all their lives seem positively\nto relish causing trouble when they themselves shall be comfortably\ndead.",

    "The ninth Marquis of Caterham had the utmost\nrespect and esteem for the memory of his brother.",

    "When George was absent Bill stretched himself\nout in the biggest chair and read the sporting news and in so doing he\nwas merely carrying out a timehonoured tradition.",

    "He was a short thickset man of\nthe working classes with something foreign in his appearance.",
    "Anthony went on into the hotel wondering as he did so what had\ninspired that searching glance.",
    "Nothing in it probably.",
    "The deep tan of\nhis face was somewhat unusual looking amongst these pallid Londoners\nand it had attracted the fellow\u2019s attention.",
    "He went up to his room\nand led by a sudden impulse crossed to the lookingglass and stood\nstudying his face in it.",
    "Of the few friends of the old days\u2014just a\nchosen few\u2014was it likely that any of them would recognize him now if\nthey were to meet him face to face He shook his head slowly.",
    "When he had left London he had been just eighteen\u2014a fair slightly\nchubby boy with a misleading seraphic expression.",
    "Small chance that\nthe boy would be recognized in the lean brownfaced man with the\nquizzical expression.",
    "The telephone beside the bed rang and Anthony crossed to the receiver.",

    "You have with you the\nMemoirs of the late Count Stylptitch.\u201d\n\nHe fixed Anthony with an accusing eye.",
    "\u201cAnd if I have What have the Memoirs of Count Stylptitch to do with\nPrince Michael\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will cause scandals.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost memoirs do that\u201d said Anthony soothingly.",
    "\u201cOf many secrets he the knowledge had.",
    "Should he reveal but the\nquarter of them Europe into war plunged may be.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome come\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cIt can\u2019t be as bad as all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn unfavourable opinion of the Obolovitch will abroad be spread.",
    "So\ndemocratic is the English spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can quite believe\u201d said Anthony \u201cthat the Obolovitch may have been\na trifle highhanded now and again.",
    "It runs in the blood.",
    "But people in\nEngland expect that sort of thing from the Balkans.",
    "I don\u2019t know why\nthey should but they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not understand\u201d said the Baron.",
    "\u201cYou do not understand at all.",
    "And my lips sealed are.\u201d He sighed.",
    "\u201cWhat exactly are you afraid of\u201d asked Anthony.",
    "\u201cUntil I have read the Memoirs I do not know\u201d explained the Baron\nsimply.",
    "\u201cBut there is sure to be something.",
    "These great diplomats are\nalways indiscreet.",
    "The apple cart upset will be as the saying goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here\u201d said Anthony kindly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re taking altogether\ntoo pessimistic a view of the thing.",
    "I know all about publishers\u2014they\nsit on manuscripts and hatch \u2019em like eggs.",
    "It will be at least a year\nbefore the thing is published.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither a very deceitful or a very simple young man you are.",
    "All is\narranged for the Memoirs in a Sunday newspaper to come out immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d Anthony was somewhat taken aback.",
    "\u201cBut you can always deny\neverything\u201d he said hopefully.",
    "The Baron shook his head sadly.",
    "\u201cNo no through the hat you talk.",
    "Let us to business come.",
    "One\nthousand pounds you are to have is it not so You see I have the good\ninformation got.\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly congratulate the Intelligence Department of the Loyalists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I to you offer fifteen hundred.\u201d\n\nAnthony stared at him in amazement then shook his head ruefully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid it can\u2019t be done\u201d he said with regret.",
    "\u201cGood.",
    "I to you offer two thousand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tempt me Baron you tempt me.",
    "But I still say it can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour own price name then.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t understand the position.",
    "I\u2019m perfectly willing to\nbelieve that you are on the side of the angels and that these Memoirs\nmay damage your cause.",
    "Nevertheless I\u2019ve undertaken the job and I\u2019ve\ngot to carry it through.",
    "See I can\u2019t allow myself to be bought off by\nthe other side.",
    "That kind of thing isn\u2019t done.\u201d\n\nThe Baron listened very attentively.",
    "At the end of Anthony\u2019s speech he\nnodded his head several times.",
    "\u201cI see.",
    "Your honour as an English gentleman it is\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we don\u2019t put it that way ourselves\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cBut I dare\nsay allowing for a difference in vocabulary that we both mean much\nthe same thing.\u201d\n\nThe Baron rose to his feet.",
    "\u201cFor the English honour I much respect have\u201d he announced.",
    "\u201cWe must\nanother way try.",
    "I wish you good morning.\u201d\n\nHe drew his heels together clicked bowed and marched out of the room\nholding himself stiffly erect.",
    "\u201cNow I wonder what he meant by that\u201d mused Anthony.",
    "\u201cWas it a threat\nNot that I\u2019m in the least afraid of old Lollipop.",
    "Rather a good name\nfor him that by the way.",
    "I shall call him Baron Lollipop.\u201d\n\nHe took a turn or two up and down the room undecided on his next\ncourse of action.",
    "The date stipulated upon for delivering the\nmanuscript was a little over a week ahead.",
    "Today was the 5th of\nOctober.",
    "Anthony had no intention of handing it over before the last\nmoment.",
    "Truth to tell he was by now feverishly anxious to read\nthese Memoirs.",
    "He had meant to do so on the boat coming over but\nhad been laid low with a touch of fever and not at all in the mood\nfor deciphering crabbed and illegible handwriting for none of the\nmanuscript was typed.",
    "He was now more than ever determined to see what\nall the fuss was about.",
    "There was the other job too.",
    "On an impulse he picked up the telephone book and looked up the name\nof Revel.",
    "There were six Revels in the book Edward Henry Revel\nsurgeon of Harley Street James Revel  Co. saddlers Lennox Revel\nof Abbotbury Mansions Hampstead Miss Mary Revel with an address in\nEaling Hon.",
    "Mrs. Timothy Revel of 487 Pont Street and Mrs. Willis\nRevel of 42 Cadogan Square.",
    "Eliminating the saddlers and Miss Mary\nRevel that gave him four names to investigate\u2014and there was no reason\nto suppose that the lady lived in London at all He shut up the book\nwith a short shake of the head.",
    "\u201cFor the moment I\u2019ll leave it to chance\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSomething usually\nturns up.\u201d\n\nThe luck of the Anthony Cades of this world is perhaps in some measure\ndue to their own belief in it.",
    "Anthony found what he was after not half\nan hour later when he was turning over the pages of an illustrated\npaper.",
    "It was a representation of some tableau organized by the Duchess\nof Perth.",
    "Below the central figure a woman in Eastern dress was the\ninscription\n\n\u201cThe Hon.",
    "Mrs. Timothy Revel as Cleopatra.",
    "Before her marriage Mrs.\nRevel was the Hon.",
    "Virginia Cawthron a daughter of Lord Edgbaston.\u201d\n\nAnthony looked at the picture some time slowly pursing up his lips as\nthough to whistle.",
    "Then he tore out the whole page folded it up and\nput it in his pocket.",
    "He went upstairs again unlocked his suitcase\nand took out the packet of letters.",
    "He took out the folded page from\nhis pocket and slipped it under the string that held them together.",
    "Then at a sudden sound behind him he wheeled round sharply.",
    "A\nman was standing in the doorway the kind of man whom Anthony had\nfondly imagined existed only in the chorus of a Comic Opera.",
    "A\nsinisterlooking figure with a squat brutal head and lips drawn back\nin an evil grin.",
    "\u201cWhat the devil are you doing here\u201d asked Anthony.",
    "\u201cAnd who let you\ncome up\u201d\n\n\u201cI pass where I please\u201d said the stranger.",
    "His voice was guttural and\nforeign though his English was idiomatic enough.",
    "\u201cAnother Dago\u201d thought Anthony.",
    "\u201cWell get out do you hear\u201d he went on aloud.",
    "The man\u2019s eyes were fixed on the packet of letters which Anthony had\ncaught up.",
    "\u201cI will get out when you have given me what I have come for.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that may I ask\u201d\n\nThe man took a step nearer.",
    "\u201cThe Memoirs of Count Stylptitch\u201d he hissed.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to take you seriously\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re so\ncompletely the stage villain.",
    "I like your get up very much.",
    "Who sent\nyou here Baron Lollipop\u201d\n\n\u201cBaron\u2014\u2014\u201d The man jerked out a string of harshsounding consonants.",
    "\u201cSo that\u2019s how you pronounce it is it A cross between gargling and\nbarking like a dog.",
    "I don\u2019t think I could say it myself\u2014my throat\u2019s\nnot made that way.",
    "I shall have to go on calling him Lollipop.",
    "So he\nsent you did he\u201d\n\nBut he received a vehement negative.",
    "His visitor went so far as to spit\nupon the suggestion in a very realistic manner.",
    "Then he drew from his\npocket a sheet of paper which he threw upon the table.",
    "\u201cLook\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cLook and tremble accursed Englishman.\u201d\n\nAnthony looked with some interest not troubling to fulfil the latter\npart of the command.",
    "On the paper was traced the crude design of a\nhuman hand in red.",
    "\u201cIt looks like a hand\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cBut if you say so I\u2019m quite\nprepared to admit that it\u2019s a cubist picture of Sunset at the North\nPole.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the sign of the Comrades of the Red Hand.",
    "I am a Comrade of the\nRed Hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say so\u201d said Anthony looking at him with much interest.",
    "\u201cAre the others all like you I don\u2019t know what the Eugenic Society\nwould have to say about it.\u201d\n\nThe man snarled angrily.",
    "\u201cDog\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWorse than dog.",
    "Paid slave of an effete monarchy.",
    "Give\nme the Memoirs and you shall go unscathed.",
    "Such is the clemency of the\nBrotherhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of them I\u2019m sure\u201d said Anthony \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid\nthat both they and you are labouring under a misapprehension.",
    "My\ninstructions are to deliver the manuscript\u2014not to your amiable\nSociety but to a certain firm of publishers.\u201d\n\n\u201cPah\u201d laughed the other.",
    "\u201cDo you think you will ever be permitted to\nreach that office alive Enough of this fool\u2019s talk.",
    "Hand over the\npapers or I shoot.\u201d\n\nHe drew a revolver from his pocket and brandished it in the air.",
    "But there he misjudged his Anthony Cade.",
    "He was not used to men who\ncould act as quickly\u2014or quicker than they could think.",
    "Anthony did not\nwait to be covered by the revolver.",
    "Almost as soon as the other got it\nout of his pocket Anthony had sprung forward and knocked it out of his\nhand.",
    "The force of the blow sent the man swinging round so that he\npresented his back to his assailant.",
    "The chance was too good to be missed.",
    "With one mighty welldirected\nkick Anthony sent the man flying through the doorway into the\ncorridor where he collapsed in a heap.",
    "Anthony stepped out after him but the doughty Comrade of the Red Hand\nhad had enough.",
    "He got nimbly to his feet and fled down the passage.",
    "Anthony did not pursue him but went back into his own room.",
    "\u201cSo much for the Comrades of the Red Hand\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cPicturesque\nappearance but easily routed by direct action.",
    "How the hell did that\nfellow get in I wonder There\u2019s one thing that stands out pretty\nclearly\u2014this isn\u2019t going to be quite such a soft job as I thought.",
    "I\u2019ve already fallen foul of both the Loyalist and the Revolutionary\nparties.",
    "Soon I suppose the Nationalists and the Independent Liberals\nwill be sending up a delegation.",
    "One thing\u2019s fixed.",
    "I start on that\nmanuscript tonight.\u201d\n\nLooking at his watch Anthony discovered that it was nearly nine\no\u2019clock and he decided to dine where he was.",
    "He did not anticipate\nany more surprise visits but he felt that it was up to him to be on\nhis guard.",
    "He had no intention of allowing his suitcase to be rifled\nwhilst he was downstairs in the Grill Room.",
    "He rang the bell and asked\nfor the Menu selected a couple of dishes and ordered a bottle of\nBordeaux.",
    "The waiter took the order and withdrew.",
    "Whilst he was waiting for the meal to arrive he got out the package of\nmanuscript and put it on the table with the letters.",
    "There was a knock at the door and the waiter entered with a small\ntable and the accessories of the meal.",
    "Anthony had strolled over to the\nmantelpiece.",
    "Standing there with his back to the room he was directly\nfacing the mirror and idly glancing in it he noticed a curious thing.",
    "The waiter\u2019s eyes were glued on the parcel of manuscript.",
    "Shooting\nlittle glances sideways at Anthony\u2019s immovable back he moved softly\nround the table.",
    "His hands were twitching and he kept passing his\ntongue over his dry lips.",
    "Anthony observed him more closely.",
    "He was a\ntall man supple like all waiters with a cleanshaven mobile face.",
    "An\nItalian Anthony thought not a Frenchman.",
    "At the critical moment Anthony wheeled round abruptly.",
    "The waiter\nstarted slightly but pretended to be doing something with the salt\ncellar.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name\u201d asked Anthony abruptly.",
    "\u201cGiuseppe Monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cItalian eh\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Monsieur.\u201d\n\nAnthony spoke to him in that language and the man answered fluently\nenough.",
    "Finally Anthony dismissed him with a nod but all the while\nhe was eating the excellent meal which Giuseppe served to him he was\nthinking rapidly.",
    "Had he been mistaken Was Giuseppe\u2019s interest in the parcel just\nordinary curiosity It might be so but remembering the feverish\nintensity of the man\u2019s excitement Anthony decided against that theory.",
    "All the same he was puzzled.",
    "\u201cDash it all\u201d said Anthony to himself \u201cevery one can\u2019t be after the\nblasted manuscript.",
    "Perhaps I\u2019m fancying things.\u201d\n\nDinner concluded and cleared away he applied himself to the perusal of\nthe Memoirs.",
    "Owing to the illegibility of the late Count\u2019s handwriting\nthe business was a slow one.",
    "Anthony\u2019s yawns succeeded one another with\nsuspicious rapidity.",
    "At the end of the fourth chapter he gave it up.",
    "So far he had found the Memoirs insufferably dull with no hint of\nscandal of any kind.",
    "He gathered up the letters and the wrapping of the manuscript which\nwere lying in a heap together on the table and locked them up in the\nsuitcase.",
    "Then he locked the door and as an additional precaution put\na chair against it.",
    "On the chair he placed the waterbottle from the\nbathroom.",
    "Surveying these preparations with some pride he undressed and got into\nbed.",
    "He had one more shot at the Count\u2019s Memoirs but felt his eyelids\ndrooping and stuffing the manuscript under his pillow he switched out\nthe light and fell asleep almost immediately.",
    "It must have been some four hours later that he awoke with a start.",
    "What had awakened him he did not know\u2014perhaps a sound perhaps only\nthe consciousness of danger which in men who have led an adventurous\nlife is very fully developed.",
    "For a moment he lay quite still trying to focus his impressions.",
    "He\ncould hear a very stealthy rustle and then he became aware of a denser\nblackness somewhere between him and the window\u2014on the floor by the\nsuitcase.",
    "With a sudden spring Anthony jumped out of bed switching the light on\nas he did so.",
    "A figure sprang up from where it had been kneeling by the\nsuitcase.",
    "It was the waiter Giuseppe.",
    "In his right hand gleamed a long thin\nknife.",
    "He hurled himself straight upon Anthony who was by now fully\nconscious of his own danger.",
    "He was unarmed and Giuseppe was evidently\nthoroughly at home with his own weapon.",
    "Anthony sprang to one side and Giuseppe missed him with the knife.",
    "The next minute the two men were rolling on the floor together locked\nin a close embrace.",
    "The whole of Anthony\u2019s faculties were centred on\nkeeping a close grip of Giuseppe\u2019s right arm so that he would be unable\nto use the knife.",
    "He bent it slowly back.",
    "At the same time he felt the\nItalian\u2019s other hand clutching at his windpipe stifling him choking.",
    "And still desperately he bent the right arm back.",
    "There was a sharp tinkle as the knife fell on the floor.",
    "At the same\ntime the Italian extricated himself with a swift twist from Anthony\u2019s\ngrasp.",
    "Anthony sprang up too but made the mistake of moving towards\nthe door to cut off the other\u2019s retreat.",
    "He saw too late that the\nchair and the waterbottle were just as he had arranged them.",
    "Giuseppe had entered by the window and it was the window he made for\nnow.",
    "In the instant\u2019s respite given him by Anthony\u2019s move toward the\ndoor he had sprung out on the balcony leaped over to the adjoining\nbalcony and had disappeared through the adjoining window.",
    "Anthony knew well enough that it was of no use to pursue him.",
    "His\nway of retreat was doubtless fully assured.",
    "Anthony would merely get\nhimself into trouble.",
    "He walked over to the bed thrusting his hand beneath the pillow and\ndrawing out the Memoirs.",
    "Lucky that they had been there and not in the\nsuitcase.",
    "He crossed over to the suitcase and looked inside meaning\nto take out the letters.",
    "Then he swore softly under his breath.",
    "The letters were gone.",
    "6\n\nThe Gentle Art of Blackmail\n\n\nIt was exactly five minutes to four when Virginia Revel rendered\npunctual by a healthy curiosity returned to the house in Pont Street.",
    "She opened the door with her latchkey and stepped into the hall to be\nimmediately confronted by the impassive Chilvers.",
    "\u201cI beg pardon ma\u2019am but a\u2014a person has called to see you\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nFor the moment Virginia did not pay attention to the subtle\nphraseology whereby Chilvers cloaked his meaning.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Lomax Where is he In the drawingroom\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no ma\u2019am not Mr. Lomax.\u201d Chilvers\u2019 tone was faintly reproachful.",
    "\u201cA person\u2014I was reluctant to let him in but he said his business\nwas most important\u2014connected with the late Captain I understood\nhim to say.",
    "Thinking therefore that you might wish to see him I put\nhim\u2014er\u2014in the study.\u201d\n\nVirginia stood thinking for a minute.",
    "She had been a widow now for some\nyears and the fact that she rarely spoke of her husband was taken by\nsome to indicate that below her careless demeanour was a still aching\nwound.",
    "By others it was taken to mean the exact opposite that Virginia\nhad never really cared for Tim Revel and that she found it insincere\nto profess a grief she did not feel.",
    "\u201cI should have mentioned ma\u2019am\u201d continued Chilvers \u201cthat the man\nappears to be some kind of foreigner.\u201d\n\nVirginia\u2019s interest heightened a little.",
    "Her husband had been in the\nDiplomatic Service and they had been together in Herzoslovakia just\nbefore the sensational murder of the King and Queen.",
    "This man might\nprobably be a Herzoslovakian some old servant who had fallen on evil\ndays.",
    "\u201cYou did quite right Chilvers\u201d she said with a quick approving nod.",
    "\u201cWhere did you say you had put him In the study\u201d\n\nShe crossed the hall with her light buoyant step and opened the door\nof the small room that flanked the diningroom.",
    "The visitor was sitting in a chair by the fireplace.",
    "He rose on her\nentrance and stood looking at her.",
    "Virginia had an excellent memory for\nfaces and she was at once quite sure that she had never seen the man\nbefore.",
    "He was tall and dark supple in figure and quite unmistakably\na foreigner but she did not think he was of Slavonic origin.",
    "She put\nhim down as Italian or possibly Spanish.",
    "\u201cYou wished to see me\u201d she asked.",
    "\u201cI am Mrs. Revel.\u201d\n\nThe man did not answer for a minute or two.",
    "He was looking her slowly\nover as though appraising her narrowly.",
    "There was a veiled insolence\nin his manner which she was quick to feel.",
    "\u201cWill you please state your business\u201d she said with a touch of\nimpatience.",
    "\u201cYou are Mrs. Revel Mrs. Timothy Revel\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "I told you so just now.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
    "It is a good thing that you consented to see me Mrs. Revel.",
    "Otherwise as I told your butler I should have been compelled to do\nbusiness with your husband.\u201d\n\nVirginia looked at him in astonishment but some impulse quelled the\nretort that sprang to her lips.",
    "She contented herself by remarking\ndryly\n\n\u201cYou might have found some difficulty in doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think not.",
    "I am very persistent.",
    "But I will come to the point.",
    "Perhaps you recognize this\u201d\n\nHe flourished something in his hand.",
    "Virginia looked at it without much\ninterest.",
    "\u201cCan you tell me what it is madame\u201d\n\n\u201cIt appears to be a letter\u201d replied Virginia who was by now convinced\nthat she had to do with a man who was mentally unhinged.",
    "\u201cAnd perhaps you note to whom it is addressed\u201d said the man\nsignificantly holding it out to her.",
    "\u201cI can read\u201d Virginia informed him pleasantly.",
    "\u201cIt is addressed to a\nCaptain O\u2019Neill at Rue de Quenelles No.",
    "15 Paris.\u201d\n\nThe man seemed searching her face hungrily for something he did not\nfind.",
    "\u201cWill you read it please\u201d\n\nVirginia took the envelope from him drew out the enclosure and glanced\nat it but almost immediately she stiffened and held it out to him\nagain.",
    "\u201cThis is a private letter\u2014certainly not meant for my eyes.\u201d\n\nThe man laughed sardonically.",
    "\u201cI congratulate you Mrs. Revel on your admirable acting.",
    "You play\nyour part to perfection.",
    "Nevertheless I think that you will hardly be\nable to deny the signature\u201d\n\n\u201cThe signature\u201d\n\nVirginia turned the letter over\u2014and was struck dumb with astonishment.",
    "The signature written in a delicate slanting hand was Virginia Revel.",
    "Checking the exclamation of astonishment that rose to her lips she\nturned again to the beginning of the letter and deliberately read the\nwhole thing through.",
    "Then she stood a minute lost in thought.",
    "The\nnature of the letter made it clear enough what was in prospect.",
    "\u201cWell madame\u201d said the man.",
    "\u201cThat is your name is it not\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s my name.\u201d \u201cBut not my handwriting\u201d she\nmight have added.",
    "Instead she turned a dazzling smile upon her visitor.",
    "\u201cSupposing\u201d she said sweetly \u201cwe sit down and talk it over\u201d\n\nHe was puzzled.",
    "Not so had he expected her to behave.",
    "His instinct\ntold him that she was not afraid of him.",
    "\u201cFirst of all I should like to know how you found me out\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was easy.\u201d\n\nHe took from his pocket a page torn from an illustrated paper and\nhanded it to her.",
    "Anthony Cade would have recognized it.",
    "She gave it back to him with a thoughtful little frown.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIt was very easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you understand Mrs. Revel that that is not the only\nletter.",
    "There are others.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me\u201d said Virginia \u201cI seem to have been frightfully indiscreet.\u201d\n\nAgain she could see that her light tone puzzled him.",
    "She was by now\nthoroughly enjoying herself.",
    "\u201cAt any rate\u201d she said smiling sweetly at him \u201cit\u2019s very kind of you\nto call and give them back to me.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause as he cleared his throat.",

    "\u201cAs such you will doubtless find it easier to enter the Kingdom of\nHeaven or so I have always heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot afford to let you have these letters for nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you are under a misapprehension.",
    "Those letters are the\nproperty of the person who wrote them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat may be the law madame but in this country you have a saying\n\u2018Possession is nine points of the law.\u2019 And in any case are you\nprepared to invoke the aid of the law\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law is a severe one for blackmailers\u201d Virginia reminded him.",
    "\u201cCome Mrs. Revel I am not quite a fool.",
    "I have read these\nletters\u2014the letters of a woman to her lover one and all breathing\ndread of discovery by her husband.",
    "Do you want me to take them to your\nhusband\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have overlooked one possibility.",
    "Those letters were written some\nyears ago.",

    "\u201cIn that case\u2014if you had nothing to fear\u2014you would not be sitting\nhere making terms with me.\u201d\n\nVirginia smiled.",
    "\u201cWhat is your price\u201d she asked in a businesslike manner.",
    "\u201cFor one thousand pounds I will hand the whole packet over to you.",
    "It\nis very little that I am asking there but you see I do not like the\nbusiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t dream of paying you a thousand pounds\u201d said Virginia with\ndecision.",
    "\u201cMadame I never bargain.",
    "A thousand pounds and I will place the\nletters in your hands.\u201d\n\nVirginia reflected.",
    "\u201cYou must give me a little time to think it over.",
    "It will not be easy\nfor me to get such a sum together.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few pounds on account perhaps\u2014say fifty\u2014and I will call again.\u201d\n\nVirginia looked up at the clock.",
    "It was five minutes past four and she\nfancied that she had heard the bell.",
    "\u201cVery well\u201d she said hurriedly.",
    "\u201cCome back tomorrow but later than\nthis.",
    "About six.\u201d\n\nShe crossed over to a desk that stood against the wall unlocked one of\nthe drawers and took out an untidy handful of notes.",
    "\u201cThere is about forty pounds here.",
    "That will have to do for you.\u201d\n\nHe snatched at it eagerly.",
    "\u201cAnd now go at once please\u201d said Virginia.",
    "He left the room obediently enough.",
    "Through the open door Virginia\ncaught a glimpse of George Lomax in the hall just being ushered\nupstairs by Chilvers.",
    "As the front door closed Virginia called to him.",
    "\u201cCome in here George.",
    "Chilvers bring us tea in here will you please\u201d\n\nShe flung open both windows and George Lomax came into the room to\nfind her standing erect with dancing eyes and windblown hair.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll shut them in a minute George but I felt the room ought to be\naired.",
    "Did you fall over the blackmailer in the hall\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackmailer George.",
    "B.L.A.C.K.M.A.I.L.E.R Blackmailer.",

    "The\ngood gentleman mistook me for someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou rang up the police I suppose\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t.",
    "I suppose you think I ought to have done so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u2014\u201d George considered weightily.",
    "\u201cNo no perhaps not\u2014perhaps\nyou acted wisely.",
    "You might be mixed up in some unpleasant publicity in\nconnection with the case.",
    "You might even have had to give evidence\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI should have liked that\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cI would love to be\nsummoned and I should like to see if judges really do make all the\nrotten jokes you read about.",
    "It would be most exciting.",
    "I was at Vine\nStreet the other day to see about a diamond brooch I had lost and\nthere was the most perfectly lovely inspector\u2014the nicest man I ever\nmet.\u201d\n\nGeorge as was his custom let all irrelevancies pass.",
    "\u201cBut what did you do about this scoundrel\u201d\n\n\u201cWell George I\u2019m afraid I let him do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackmail me.\u201d\n\nGeorge\u2019s face of horror was so poignant that Virginia had to bite her\nunder lip.",
    "\u201cYou mean\u2014do I understand you to mean\u2014that you did not correct the\nmisapprehension under which he was labouring\u201d\n\nVirginia shook her head shooting a sideways glance at him.",
    "\u201cGood heavens Virginia you must be mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose it would seem that way to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why In God\u2019s name why\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral reasons.",
    "To begin with he was doing it so\nbeautifully\u2014blackmailing me I mean\u2014I hate to interrupt an artist\nwhen he\u2019s doing his job really well.",
    "And then you see I\u2019d never been\nblackmailed\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI should hope not indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I wanted to see what it felt like.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am quite at a loss to comprehend you Virginia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not give him money I hope\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a trifle\u201d said Virginia apologetically.",
    "\u201cHow much\u201d\n\n\u201cForty pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cVirginia\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear George it\u2019s only what I pay for an evening dress.",
    "It\u2019s just\nas exciting to buy a new experience as it is to buy a new dress\u2014more\nso in fact.\u201d\n\nGeorge Lomax merely shook his head and Chilvers appearing at that\nmoment with the tea urn he was saved from having to express his\noutraged feelings.",
    "When tea had been brought in and Virginia\u2019s deft\nfingers were manipulating the heavy silver teapot she spoke again on\nthe subject.",
    "\u201cI had another motive too George\u2014a brighter and better one.",
    "We women\nare usually supposed to be cats but at any rate I\u2019d done another woman\na good turn this afternoon.",
    "This man isn\u2019t likely to go off looking\nfor another Virginia Revel.",
    "He thinks he\u2019s found his bird all right.",
    "Poor little devil she was in a blue funk when she wrote that letter.",
    "Mr. Blackmailer would have had the easiest job of his life there.",
    "Now though he doesn\u2019t know it he\u2019s up against a tough proposition.",
    "Starting with the great advantage of having led a blameless life I\nshall toy with him to his undoing\u2014as they say in books.",
    "Guile George\nlots of guile.\u201d\n\nGeorge still shook his head.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d he persisted.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell never mind George dear.",

    "\u201cAnd I am glad to\nfind you alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh George this is so sudden\u201d says she swallowing a currant.",
    "\u201cI wanted to ask a favour of you.",
    "I have always considered you\nVirginia as a woman of considerable charm.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh George\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd also a woman of intelligence\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really How well the man knows me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Virginia there is a young fellow arriving in England\ntomorrow whom I should like you to meet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right George but it\u2019s your party\u2014let that be clearly\nunderstood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could I feel sure if you chose exercise your considerable\ncharm.\u201d\n\nVirginia cocked her head a little on one side.",

    "Often I like\npeople\u2014and then well they like me.",
    "But I don\u2019t think I could set\nout in cold blood to fascinate a helpless stranger.",
    "That sort of thing\nisn\u2019t done George it really isn\u2019t.",
    "There are professional sirens who\nwould do it much better than I should.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is out of the question Virginia.",

    "What is the deep idea\nGeorge To put it vulgarly what do you get out of it\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot see that that concerns you Virginia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly go out for an evening and fascinate unless I knew\nall the whys and wherefors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a most extraordinary way of putting things Virginia.",
    "Anyone\nwould think\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t they Come on George part with a little more information.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Virginia matters are likely to be a little strained shortly\nin a certain Central European nation.",
    "It is important for reasons\nwhich are immaterial that this\u2014Mr.\u2014er McGrath should be brought\nto realize that the restoring of the Monarchy in Herzoslovakia is\nimperative to the peace of Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe part about the peace of Europe is all bosh\u201d said Virginia calmly\n\u201cbut I\u2019m all for Monarchies every time especially for a picturesque\npeople like the Herzoslovakians.",
    "So you\u2019re running a King in the\nHerzoslovakian States are you Who is he\u201d\n\nGeorge was reluctant to answer but did not see his way to avoid the\nquestion.",
    "The interview was not going at all as he had planned.",
    "He\nhad foreseen Virginia as a willing docile tool receiving his hints\ngratefully and asking no awkward questions.",
    "This was far from being\nthe case.",
    "She seemed determined to know all about it and this George\never doubtful of female discretion was determined at all costs to\navoid.",
    "He had made a mistake.",
    "Virginia was not the woman for the\npart.",
    "She might indeed cause serious trouble.",
    "Her account of her\ninterview with the blackmailer had caused him grave apprehension.",

    "\u201cPrince Michael Obolovitch\u201d he replied as Virginia was obviously\nwaiting for an answer to her question.",
    "\u201cBut please let that go no\nfurther.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd George.",
    "There are all sort of hints in the papers\nalready and articles cracking up the Obolovitch dynasty and talking\nabout the murdered Nicholas IV as though he were a cross between\na Saint and a hero instead of a stupid little man besotted by a\nthirdrate actress.\u201d\n\nGeorge winced.",
    "He was more than ever convinced that he had made a\nmistake in enlisting Virginia\u2019s aid.",
    "He must stave her off quickly.",
    "\u201cYou are right my dear Virginia\u201d he said hastily as he rose to his\nfeet to bid her farewell.",
    "\u201cI should not have made the suggestion I did\nto you.",

    "As an ardent Monarchist and with your knowledge\nof the country I thought it a good plan for you to meet him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the explanation is it\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but I dare say you wouldn\u2019t have cared for him.\u201d\n\nVirginia looked at him for a second and then she laughed.",

    "\u201cI have told you the truth\u201d he said coldly and he said it without a\nblush.",

    "Anthony realized very well that he\ncould not pursue Giuseppe through the corridors of the Blitz Hotel.",
    "To\ndo so was to court undesired publicity and in all probability to fail\nin his object all the same.",
    "He came to the conclusion that Giuseppe had mistaken the packet of\nletters enclosed as they were in the other wrappings for the Memoirs\nthemselves.",
    "It was likely therefore that when he discovered his mistake\nhe would make another attempt to get hold of the Memoirs.",
    "For this\nattempt Anthony intended to be fully prepared.",
    "Another plan that occurred to him was to advertize discreetly for the\nreturn of the package of letters.",
    "Supposing Giuseppe to be an emissary\nof the Comrades of the Red Hand or which seemed to Anthony more\nprobable to be employed by the Loyalist party the letters could have\nno possible interest for either employer and he would probably jump at\nthe chance of obtaining a small sum of money for their return.",
    "Having thought out all this Anthony returned to bed and slept\npeacefully until morning.",
    "He did not fancy that Giuseppe would be\nanxious for a second encounter that night.",
    "Anthony got up with his plan of campaign fully thought out.",
    "He had\na good breakfast glanced at the papers which were full of the new\ndiscoveries of oil in Herzoslovakia and then demanded an interview\nwith the manager and being Anthony Cade with a gift for getting his\nown way by means of quiet determination he obtained what he asked for.",
    "The manager a Frenchman with an exquisitely suave manner received him\nin his private office.",
    "\u201cYou wished to see me I understand Mr.\u2014er\u2014McGrath\u201d\n\n\u201cI did.",
    "I arrived at your hotel yesterday afternoon and I had dinner\nserved to me in my own rooms by a waiter whose name was Giuseppe.\u201d\n\nHe paused.",
    "\u201cI dare say we have a waiter of that name\u201d agreed the manager\nindifferently.",
    "\u201cI was struck by something unusual in the waiter\u2019s manner but thought\nnothing more of it at the time.",
    "Later in the night I was awakened by\nthe sound of some one moving softly about the room.",
    "I switched on the\nlight and found this same Giuseppe in the act of rifling my leather\nsuitcase.\u201d\n\nThe manager\u2019s indifference had completely disappeared now.",
    "\u201cBut I have heard nothing of this\u201d he exclaimed.",
    "\u201cWhy was I not\ninformed sooner\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man and I had a brief struggle\u2014he was armed with a knife by the\nway.",
    "In the end he succeeded in making off by way of the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you do then Mr. McGrath\u201d\n\n\u201cI examined the contents of my suitcase.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad anything been taken\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing of\u2014importance\u201d said Anthony slowly.",
    "The manager leaned back with a sigh.",
    "\u201cI am glad of that\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cBut you will allow me to say Mr.\nMcGrath that I do not quite understand your attitude in the matter.",
    "You made no attempt to arouse the hotel To pursue the thief\u201d\n\nAnthony shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cNothing of value had been taken as I tell you.",
    "I am aware of\ncourse that strictly speaking it is a case for the police\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nHe paused and the manager murmured without any particular enthusiasm\n\n\u201cFor the police\u2014of course\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any case I was fairly certain that the man would manage to make\ngood his escape and since nothing was taken why bother with the\npolice\u201d\n\nThe manager smiled a little.",
    "\u201cI see that you realize Mr. McGrath that I am not at all anxious\nto have the police called in.",
    "From my point of view it is always\ndisastrous.",
    "If the newspapers can get hold of anything connected with\na big fashionable hotel such as this they always run it for all it is\nworth no matter how insignificant the real subject matter may be.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so\u201d agreed Anthony.",
    "\u201cNow I told you that nothing of value had\nbeen taken and that was perfectly true in a sense.",
    "Nothing of any\nvalue to the thief was taken but he got hold of something which is of\nconsiderable value to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d\n\n\u201cLetters you understand.\u201d\n\nAn expression of superhuman discretion only to be achieved by a\nFrenchman settled down upon the manager\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cI comprehend\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cBut perfectly.",
    "Naturally it is not a\nmatter for the police.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are quite agreed upon that point.",
    "But you will understand that\nI have every intention of recovering these letters.",
    "In the part of\nthe world where I come from people are used to doing things for\nthemselves.",
    "What I require from you therefore is the fullest possible\ninformation you can give me about this waiter Giuseppe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see no objection to that\u201d said the manager after a moment or two\u2019s\npause.",
    "\u201cI cannot give you the information offhand of course but if\nyou will return in half an hour\u2019s time I will have everything ready to\nlay before you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you very much.",
    "That will suit me admirably.\u201d\n\nIn half an hour\u2019s time Anthony returned to the office again to find\nthat the manager had been as good as his word.",
    "Jotted down upon a piece\nof paper were all the relevant facts known about Giuseppe Manelli.",
    "\u201cHe came to us you see about three months ago.",
    "A skilled and\nexperienced waiter.",
    "Has given complete satisfaction.",
    "He has been in\nEngland about five years.\u201d\n\nTogether the two men ran over a list of the hotels and restaurants\nwhere the Italian had worked.",
    "One fact struck Anthony as being possibly\nof significance.",
    "At two of the hotels in question there had been\nserious robberies during the time that Giuseppe was employed there\nthough no suspicion of any kind had attached to him in either case.",
    "Still the fact was significant.",
    "Was Giuseppe merely a clever hotel thief Had his search of Anthony\u2019s\nsuitcase been merely part of his habitual professional tactics He\nmight just possibly have had the packet of letters in his hand at the\nmoment when Anthony switched on the light and have shoved it into his\npocket mechanically so as to have his hands free.",
    "In that case the\nthing was mere plain or garden robbery.",
    "Against that there was to be put the man\u2019s excitement of the evening\nbefore when he had caught sight of the papers lying on the table.",
    "There\nhad been no money or object of value there such as would excite the\ncupidity of an ordinary thief.",
    "No Anthony felt convinced that Giuseppe had been acting as a tool\nfor some outside agency.",
    "With the information supplied to him by the\nmanager it might be possible to learn something about Giuseppe\u2019s\nprivate life and so finally track him down.",
    "He gathered up the sheet\nof paper and rose.",
    "\u201cThank you very much indeed.",
    "It\u2019s quite unnecessary to ask I suppose\nwhether Giuseppe is still in the hotel\u201d\n\nThe manager smiled.",
    "\u201cHis bed was not slept in and all his things have been left behind.",
    "He\nmust have rushed straight out after his attack upon you.",
    "I don\u2019t think\nthere is much chance of our seeing him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI imagine not.",
    "Well thank you very much indeed.",
    "I shall be staying on\nhere for the present.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you will be successful in your task but I confess that I am\nrather doubtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always hope for the best.\u201d\n\nOne of Anthony\u2019s first proceedings was to question some of the other\nwaiters who had been friendly with Giuseppe but he obtained very\nlittle to go upon.",
    "He wrote out an advertisement on the lines he had\nplanned and had it sent to five of the most widely read newspapers.",
    "He\nwas just about to go out and visit the restaurant at which Giuseppe had\nbeen previously employed when the telephone rang.",
    "Anthony took up the\nreceiver.",
    "\u201cHullo what is it\u201d\n\nA toneless voice replied.",
    "\u201cAm I speaking to Mr. McGrath\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are.",

    "Just a minute please.",
    "I will\nput you through to Mr. Balderson.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur worthy publishers\u201d thought Anthony.",
    "\u201cSo they are getting worried\ntoo are they They needn\u2019t.",
    "There\u2019s a week to run still.\u201d\n\nA hearty voice struck suddenly upon his ear.",
    "\u201cHullo That Mr. McGrath\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Mr. Balderson of Balderson and Hodgkins.",
    "What about that\nmanuscript Mr. McGrath\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Anthony \u201cwhat about it\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about it.",
    "I understand Mr. McGrath that you have just\narrived in this country from South Africa.",
    "That being so you can\u2019t\npossibly understand the position.",
    "There\u2019s going to be trouble about\nthat manuscript Mr. McGrath big trouble.",
    "Sometimes I wish we\u2019d never\nsaid we\u2019d handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you it\u2019s so.",
    "At present I\u2019m anxious to get it into my\npossession as quickly as possible so as to have a couple of copies\nmade.",
    "Then if the original is destroyed\u2014well no harm will be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cYes I expect it sounds absurd to you Mr. McGrath.",
    "But I assure\nyou you don\u2019t appreciate the situation.",
    "There\u2019s a determined effort\nbeing made to prevent its ever reaching this office.",
    "I say to you quite\nfrankly and without humbug that if you attempt to bring it yourself\nit\u2019s ten to one that you\u2019ll never get here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt that\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cWhen I want to get anywhere I usually\ndo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up against a very dangerous lot of people.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t have\nbelieved it myself a month ago.",
    "I tell you Mr. McGrath we\u2019ve been\nbribed and threatened and cajoled by one lot and another until we don\u2019t\nknow whether we\u2019re on our heads or our heels.",
    "My suggestion is that you\ndo not attempt to bring the manuscript here.",
    "One of our people will\ncall upon you at the hotel and take possession of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd supposing the gang does him in\u201d asked Anthony.",
    "\u201cThe responsibility would then be ours\u2014not yours.",
    "You would have\ndelivered it to our representative and obtained a written discharge.",
    "The cheque for\u2014er\u2014a thousand pounds which we are instructed to hand\nto you will not be available until Wednesday next by the terms of our\nagreement with the executors of the late\u2014er\u2014author\u2014you know whom I\nmean but if you insist I will send my own cheque for that amount by\nthe messenger.\u201d\n\nAnthony reflected for a minute or two.",
    "He had intended to keep the\nMemoirs until the last day of grace because he was anxious to see for\nhimself what all the fuss was about.",
    "Nevertheless he realized the\nforce of the publisher\u2019s arguments.",
    "\u201cAll right\u201d he said with a little sigh.",
    "\u201cHave it your own way.",
    "Send\nyour man along.",
    "And if you don\u2019t mind sending that cheque as well\nI\u2019d rather have it now as I may be going out of England before next\nWednesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly Mr. McGrath.",
    "Our representative will call upon you first\nthing tomorrow morning.",
    "It will be wiser not to send anyone direct\nfrom the office.",
    "Our Mr. Holmes lives in South London.",
    "He will call\nin on his way to us and will give you a receipt for the package.",
    "I\nsuggest that tonight you should place a dummy packet in the manager\u2019s\nsafe.",
    "Your enemies will get to hear of this and it will prevent any\nattack being made upon your apartments tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well I will do as you direct.\u201d\n\nAnthony hung up the receiver with a thoughtful face.",
    "Then he went on with his interrupted plan of seeking news of the\nslippery Giuseppe.",
    "He drew a complete blank however.",
    "Giuseppe had\nworked at the restaurant in question but nobody seemed to know\nanything of his private life or associates.",
    "\u201cBut I\u2019ll get you my lad\u201d murmured Anthony between his teeth.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll\nget you yet.",
    "It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d\n\nHis second night in London was entirely peaceful.",
    "At nine o\u2019clock the following morning the card of Mr. Holmes from\nMessrs. Balderson and Hodgkins was sent up and Mr. Holmes followed\nit.",
    "A small fair man with a quiet manner.",
    "Anthony handed over the\nmanuscript and received in exchange a cheque for a thousand pounds.",
    "Mr. Holmes packed up the manuscript in the small brown bag he carried\nwished Anthony good morning and departed.",
    "The whole thing seemed very\ntame.",
    "\u201cBut perhaps he\u2019ll be murdered on the way there\u201d Anthony murmured\naloud as he stared idly out of the window.",
    "\u201cI wonder now\u2014I very much\nwonder.\u201d\n\nHe put the cheque in an envelope enclosed a few lines of writing\nwith it and sealed it up carefully.",
    "Jimmy who had been more or less\nin funds at the time of his encounter with Anthony at Bulawayo had\nadvanced him a substantial sum of money which was as yet practically\nuntouched.",
    "\u201cIf one\u2019s job\u2019s done with the other isn\u2019t\u201d said Anthony to himself.",
    "\u201cUp to now I\u2019ve bungled it.",
    "But never say die.",
    "I think that suitably\ndisguised I shall go and have a look at 487 Pont Street.\u201d\n\nHe packed his belongings went down and paid his bill and ordered his\nluggage to be put on a taxi.",
    "Suitably rewarding those who stood in his\npath most of whom had done nothing whatever materially to add to his\ncomfort he was on the point of being driven off when a small boy\nrushed down the steps with a letter.",
    "\u201cJust come for you this very minute sir.\u201d\n\nWith a sigh Anthony produced yet another shilling.",
    "The taxi groaned\nheavily and jumped forward with a hideous crashing of gears and\nAnthony opened the letter.",
    "It was rather a curious document.",
    "He had to read it four times before\nhe could be sure of what it was all about.",
    "Put in plain English the\nletter was not in plain English but in the peculiar involved style\ncommon to missives issued by Government officials it presumed that Mr.\nMcGrath was arriving in England from South Africa today\u2014Thursday it\nreferred obliquely to the Memoirs of Count Stylptitch and begged Mr.\nMcGrath to do nothing in the matter until he had had a confidential\nconversation with Mr. George Lomax and certain other parties whose\nmagnificence was vaguely hinted at.",
    "It also contained a definite\ninvitation to go down to Chimneys as the guest of Lord Caterham on the\nfollowing day Friday.",
    "A mysterious and thoroughly obscure communication.",
    "Anthony enjoyed it\nvery much.",
    "\u201cDear old England\u201d he murmured affectionately.",
    "\u201cTwo days behind the\ntimes as usual.",
    "Rather a pity.",
    "Still I can\u2019t go down to Chimneys\nunder false pretences.",
    "I wonder though if there\u2019s an inn handy Mr.\nAnthony Cade might stay at the inn without anyone being the wiser.\u201d\n\nHe leaned out of the window and gave new directions to the taxi\ndriver who acknowledged them with a snort of contempt.",
    "The taxi drew up before one of London\u2019s more obscure hostelries.",
    "The\nfare however was paid on a scale befitting its point of departure.",
    "Having booked a room in the name of Anthony Cade Anthony passed into\na dingy writingroom took out a sheet of notepaper stamped with the\nlegend Hotel Blitz and wrote rapidly.",
    "He explained that he had arrived on the preceding Tuesday that he\nhad handed over the manuscript in question to Messrs. Balderson and\nHodgkins and he regretfully declined the kind invitation of Lord\nCaterham as he was leaving England almost immediately.",
    "He signed the\nletter \u201cYours faithfully James McGrath.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now\u201d said Anthony as he affixed the stamp to the envelope.",
    "\u201cTo\nbusiness.",
    "Exit James McGrath and Enter Anthony Cade.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nA Dead Man\n\n\nOn that same Thursday afternoon Virginia Revel had been playing tennis\nat Ranelagh.",
    "All the way back to Pont Street as she lay back in the\nlong luxurious limousine a little smile played upon her lips as\nshe rehearsed her part in the forthcoming interview.",
    "Of course it\nwas within the bounds of possibility that the blackmailer might not\nreappear but she felt pretty certain that he would.",
    "She had shown\nherself an easy prey.",
    "Well perhaps this time there would be a little\nsurprise for him\n\nWhen the car drew up at the house she turned to speak to the chauffeur\nbefore going up the steps.",
    "\u201cHow\u2019s your wife Walton I forgot to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter I think ma\u2019am.",
    "The doctor said he\u2019d look in and see her about\nhalfpast six.",
    "Will you be wanting the car again\u201d\n\nVirginia reflected for a minute.",
    "\u201cI shall be away for the weekend.",
    "I\u2019m going by the 6.40 from\nPaddington but I shan\u2019t need you again\u2014a taxi will do for that.",

    "I\u2019ll stand the\nexpense.\u201d\n\nCutting short the man\u2019s thanks with an impatient nod of the head\nVirginia ran up the steps delved into her bag in search of her\nlatchkey remembered she hadn\u2019t got it with her and hastily rang the\nbell.",
    "It was not answered at once but as she waited there a young man came\nup the steps.",
    "He was shabbily dressed and carried in his hand a sheaf\nof leaflets.",
    "He held one out to Virginia with the legend on it plainly\nvisible \u201cWhy Did I Serve my Country\u201d In his left hand he held a\ncollectingbox.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t buy two of those awful poems in one day\u201d said Virginia\npleadingly.",
    "\u201cI bought one this morning.",
    "I did indeed honour bright.\u201d\n\nThe young man threw back his head and laughed.",
    "Virginia laughed with\nhim.",
    "Running her eyes carelessly over him she thought him a more\npleasing specimen than usual of London\u2019s unemployed.",
    "She liked his\nbrown face and the lean hardness of him.",
    "She went so far as to wish\nshe had a job for him.",
    "But at that moment the door opened and immediately Virginia forgot all\nabout the problem of the unemployed for to her astonishment the door\nwas opened by her own maid \u00c9lise.",
    "\u201cWhere\u2019s Chilvers\u201d she demanded sharply as she stepped into the hall.",
    "\u201cBut he is gone madame with the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat others Gone where\u201d\n\n\u201cBut to Datchet madame\u2014to the cottage as your telegram said.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy telegram\u201d said Virginia utterly at sea.",
    "\u201cDid not madame send a telegram Surely there can be no mistake.",
    "It\ncame but an hour ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never sent any telegram.",
    "What did it say\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it is still on the table l\u00e0bas.\u201d\n\n\u00c9lise retired pounced upon it and brought it to her mistress in\ntriumph.",
    "\u201cVoil\u00e0 madame\u201d\n\nThe telegram was addressed to Chilvers and ran as follows\n\n\u201cPlease take household down to cottage at once and make preparations\nfor weekend party there.",
    "Catch 5.49 train.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing unusual about it it was just the sort of message she\nherself had frequently sent before when she had arranged a party at\nher riverside bungalow on the spur of the moment.",
    "She always took the\nwhole household down leaving an old woman as caretaker.",
    "Chilvers would\nnot have seen anything wrong with the message and like a good servant\nhad carried out his orders faithfully enough.",
    "\u201cMe I remained\u201d explained \u00c9lise \u201cknowing that madame would wish me\nto pack for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a silly hoax\u201d cried Virginia flinging down the telegram\nangrily.",

    "\u201cYes yes madame that is it without a doubt.",
    "Every day you read in\nthe papers of such things.",
    "Madame will ring up the police at once\u2014at\nonce\u2014before they arrive and cut our throats.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get so excited \u00c9lise.",

    "Virginia made a face at her retreating back and crossed the hall to\nthe little study where the telephone was.",
    "\u00c9lise\u2019s suggestion of ringing\nup the police station seemed to her a good one and she intended to act\nupon it without any further delay.",
    "She opened the study door and crossed to the telephone.",
    "Then with\nher hand on the receiver she stopped.",
    "A man was sitting in the big\narmchair sitting in a curious huddled position.",
    "In the stress of the\nmoment she had forgotten all about her expected visitor.",
    "Apparently he\nhad fallen asleep whilst waiting for her.",
    "She came right up to the chair a slightly mischievous smile upon her\nface.",
    "And then suddenly the smile faded.",
    "The man was not asleep.",
    "He was dead.",
    "She knew it at once knew it instinctively even before her eyes had\nseen and noted the small shining pistol lying on the floor the\nlittlesinged hole just above the heart with the dark stain round it\nand the horrible dropped jaw.",
    "She stood quite still her hands pressed to her sides.",
    "In the silence\nshe heard \u00c9lise running down the stairs.",
    "\u201cMadame Madame\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what is it\u201d\n\nShe moved quickly to the door.",
    "Her whole instinct was to conceal what\nhad happened\u2014for the moment anyway\u2014from \u00c9lise.",
    "\u00c9lise would promptly\ngo into hysterics she knew that well enough and she felt a great need\nfor calm and quiet in which to think things out.",
    "\u201cMadame would it not be better if I should draw the chain across the\ndoor These malefactors at any minute they may arrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes if you like.",
    "Anything you like.\u201d\n\nShe heard the rattle of the chain and then \u00c9lise running upstairs\nagain and drew a long breath of relief.",
    "She looked at the man in the chair and then at the telephone.",
    "Her\ncourse was quite clear she must ring up the police at once.",
    "But still she did not do so.",
    "She stood quite still paralysed with\nhorror and with a host of conflicting ideas rushing through her brain.",
    "The bogus telegram.",
    "Had it something to do with this Supposing\n\u00c9lise had not stayed behind She would have let herself in\u2014that is\npresuming she had had her latchkey with her as usual to find herself\nalone in the house with a murdered man\u2014a man whom she had permitted to\nblackmail her on a former occasion.",
    "Of course she had an explanation of\nthat but thinking of that explanation she was not quite easy in her\nmind.",

    "Would\nother people think the same.",
    "Those letters now\u2014of course she hadn\u2019t\nwritten them but would it be so easy to prove that\n\nShe put her hands on her forehead squeezing them tight together.",
    "\u201cI must think\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cI simply must think.\u201d\n\nWho had let the man in Surely not \u00c9lise.",
    "If she had done so she would\nhave been sure to have mentioned the fact at once.",
    "The whole thing\nseemed more and more mysterious as she thought about it.",
    "There was\nreally only one thing to be done\u2014ring up the police.",
    "She stretched out her hand to the telephone and suddenly she thought\nof George.",
    "A man\u2014that was what she wanted\u2014an ordinary levelheaded\nunemotional man who would see things in their proper proportion and\npoint out to her the best course to take.",
    "Then she shook her head.",
    "Not George.",
    "The first thing George would think\nof would be his own position.",
    "He would hate being mixed up in this\nkind of business.",
    "George wouldn\u2019t do at all.",
    "Then her face softened.",
    "Bill of course Without more ado she rang up\nBill.",
    "She was informed that he had left half an hour ago for Chimneys.",
    "\u201cOh damn\u201d cried Virginia jamming down the receiver.",
    "It was horrible\nto be shut up with a dead body and to have no one to speak to.",
    "And at that minute the frontdoor bell rang.",
    "Virginia jumped.",
    "In a few minutes it rang again.",
    "\u00c9lise she knew was\nupstairs packing and wouldn\u2019t hear it.",
    "Virginia went out in the hall drew back the chain and undid all the\nbolts that \u00c9lise had fastened in her zeal.",
    "Then with a long breath\nshe threw open the door.",
    "On the steps was the unemployed young man.",
    "Virginia plunged headlong with a relief born of overstrung nerves.",
    "\u201cCome in\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI think that perhaps I\u2019ve got a job for you.\u201d\n\nShe took him into the diningroom pulled toward a chair for him sat\ndown herself facing him and stared at him very attentively.",
    "\u201cExcuse me\u201d she said \u201cbut are you\u2014I mean\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEton and Oxford\u201d said the young man.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted to ask\nme wasn\u2019t it\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething of the kind\u201d admitted Virginia.",

    "This isn\u2019t regular work you\u2019re offering me I hope\u201d\n\nA smile hovered for a moment on her lips.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very irregular.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u201d said the young man in a tone of satisfaction.",
    "Virginia noted his bronzed face and long lean body with approval.",

    "They\u2019ve all got something to lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve nothing whatever to lose.",
    "So go ahead.",
    "What\u2019s the trouble\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a dead man in the next room\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s been\nmurdered and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d\n\nShe blurted out the words as simply as a child might have done.",
    "The young man went up enormously in her estimation by the way he\naccepted her statement.",
    "He might have been used to hearing a similar\nannouncement made every day of his life.",

    "Shall we go and view the body\nor will you give me the facts first\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d better give you the facts.\u201d She paused for a moment to\nconsider how best to condense her story and then began speaking\nquietly and concisely.",
    "\u201cThis man came to the house for the first time yesterday and asked to\nsee me.",
    "He had certain letters with him\u2014love letters signed with my\nname\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut which weren\u2019t written by you\u201d put in the young man quietly.",

    "But go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to blackmail me\u2014and I\u2014well I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll\nunderstand but I\u2014let him.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him appealingly and he nodded his head reassuringly.",
    "\u201cOf course I understand.",

    "\u201cBut mind you very\nfew people would understand that point of view.",
    "Most people you see\nhaven\u2019t got any imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s so.",

    "\u201cAnd now to view the body\u201d he said briskly.",
    "\u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you\nthis\u2014on the whole it\u2019s always best to tell the truth.",
    "One lie involves\nyou in such a lot of lies\u2014and continuous lying is so monotonous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you advise me to ring up the police\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably.",
    "But we\u2019ll just have a look at the fellow first.\u201d\n\nVirginia led the way out the room.",
    "On the threshold she paused looking\nback at him.",
    "\u201cBy the way\u201d she said \u201cyou haven\u2019t told me your name yet\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name My name\u2019s Anthony Cade.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nAnthony Disposes of a Body\n\n\nAnthony followed Virginia out of the room smiling a little to himself.",
    "Events had taken quite an unexpected turn.",
    "But as he bent over the\nfigure in the chair he grew grave again.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s still warm\u201d he said sharply.",
    "\u201cHe was killed less than half an\nhour ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust before I came in\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\nHe stood upright drawing his brows together in a frown.",
    "Then he asked\na question of which Virginia did not at once see the drift\n\n\u201cYour maid\u2019s not been in this room of course\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes she know that you\u2019ve been into it\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014yes.",
    "I came to the door to speak to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter you\u2019d found the body.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you said nothing\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it have been better if I had I thought she would go into\nhysterics\u2014she\u2019s French you know and easily upset\u2014I wanted to think\nover the best thing to do.\u201d\n\nAnthony nodded but did not speak.",
    "\u201cYou think it a pity I can see\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it was rather unfortunate Mrs. Revel.",
    "If you and the maid had\ndiscovered the body together immediately on your return it would have\nsimplified matters very much.",
    "The man would then definitely have been\nshot before your return to the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhilst now they might say he was shot after\u2014I see\u2014\u201d\n\nHe watched her taking in the idea and was confirmed in his first\nimpression of her formed when she had spoken to him on the steps\noutside.",
    "Besides beauty she possessed courage and brains.",
    "Virginia was so engrossed in the puzzle presented to her that it did\nnot occur to her to wonder at this strange man\u2019s ready use of her name.",
    "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t \u00c9lise hear the shot I wonder\u201d she murmured.",
    "Anthony pointed to the open window as a loud backfire came from a\npassing car.",
    "\u201cThere you are.",
    "London\u2019s not the place to notice a pistol shot.\u201d\n\nVirginia turned with a little shudder to the body in the chair.",
    "\u201cHe looks like an Italian\u201d she remarked curiously.",
    "\u201cHe is an Italian\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI should say that his regular\nprofession was that of a waiter.",
    "He only did blackmailing in his spare\ntime.",
    "His name might very possibly be Giuseppe.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens\u201d cried Virginia.",
    "\u201cIs this Sherlock Holmes\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Anthony regretfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just plain or garden\ncheating.",
    "I\u2019ll tell you all about it presently.",
    "Now you say this man\nshowed you some letters and asked you for money.",
    "Did you give him any\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much\u201d\n\n\u201cForty pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bad\u201d said Anthony but without manifesting any undue surprise.",
    "\u201cNow let\u2019s have a look at the telegram.\u201d\n\nVirginia picked it up from the table and gave it to him.",
    "She saw his\nface grow grave as he looked at it.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u201d\n\nHe held it out pointing silently to the place of origin.",
    "\u201cBarnes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAnd you were at Ranelagh this afternoon.",
    "What\u2019s to\nprevent you having sent it off yourself\u201d\n\nVirginia felt fascinated by his words.",
    "It was as though a net was\nclosing tighter and tighter round her.",
    "He was forcing her to see all\nthe things which she had felt dimly at the back of her mind.",
    "Anthony took out his handkerchief and wound it round his hand then he\npicked up the pistol.",
    "\u201cWe criminals have to be so careful\u201d he said apologetically.",
    "\u201cFingerprints you know.\u201d\n\nSuddenly she saw his whole figure stiffen.",
    "His voice when he spoke\nhad altered.",
    "It was terse and curt.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Revel\u201d he said \u201chave you ever seen this pistol before\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Virginia wonderingly.",
    "\u201cAre you sure of that\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you a pistol of your own\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever had one\u201d\n\n\u201cNo never.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure of that\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her steadily for a minute and Virginia stared back in\ncomplete surprise at his tone.",
    "Then with a sigh he relaxed.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s odd\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHow do you account for this\u201d\n\nHe held out the pistol.",
    "It was a small dainty article almost a\ntoy\u2014though capable of doing deadly work.",
    "Engraved on it was the name\nVirginia.",
    "\u201cOh it\u2019s impossible\u201d cried Virginia.",
    "Her astonishment was so genuine that Anthony could but believe in it.",
    "\u201cSit down\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s more in this than there seemed\nto be first go off.",
    "To begin with what\u2019s our hypothesis There are\nonly two possible ones.",
    "There is of course the real Virginia of the\nletters.",
    "She may have somehow or other tracked him down shot him\ndropped the pistol stolen the letters and taken herself off.",
    "That\u2019s\nquite possible isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so\u201d said Virginia unwillingly.",
    "\u201cThe other hypothesis is a good deal more interesting.",
    "Whoever wished\nto kill Giuseppe wished also to incriminate you\u2014in fact that may have\nbeen their main object.",
    "They could get him easily enough anywhere\nbut they took extraordinary pains and trouble to get him here and\nwhoever they were they knew all about you your cottage at Datchet\nyour usual household arrangements and the fact that you were at\nRanelagh this afternoon.",
    "It seems an absurd question but have you any\nenemies Mrs. Revel\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I haven\u2019t\u2014not that kind anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is\u201d said Anthony \u201cwhat are we going to do now There\nare two courses open to us.",
    "A Ring up the police tell the whole\nstory and trust to your unassailable position in the world and\nyour hitherto blameless life.",
    "B An attempt on my part to dispose\nsuccessfully of the body.",
    "Naturally my private inclinations urge me\nto B. I\u2019ve always wanted to see if I couldn\u2019t conceal a crime with\nthe necessary cunning but have had a squeamish objection to shedding\nblood.",
    "On the whole I expect A\u2019s the soundest.",
    "Then there\u2019s a sort of\nbowdlerized A.",
    "Ring up the police etc.",
    "but suppress the pistol and\nthe blackmailing letters\u2014that is if they are on him still.\u201d\n\nAnthony ran rapidly through the dead man\u2019s pockets.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s been stripped clean\u201d he announced.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s not a thing on him.",
    "There\u2019ll be dirty work at the crossroads over those letters yet.",
    "Hullo\nwhat\u2019s this Hole in the lining\u2014something got caught there torn\nroughly out and a scrap of paper left behind.\u201d\n\nHe drew out the scrap of paper as he spoke and brought it over to the\nlight.",
    "Virginia joined him.",
    "\u201cPity we haven\u2019t got the rest of it\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cChimneys 11.45\nThursday\u2014Sounds like an appointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cChimneys\u201d cried Virginia.",
    "\u201cHow extraordinary\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy extraordinary Rather high toned for such a low fellow\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to Chimneys this evening.",
    "At least I was.\u201d\n\nAnthony wheeled round on her.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s that Say that again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to Chimneys this evening\u201d repeated Virginia.",
    "Anthony stared at her.",
    "\u201cI begin to see.",
    "At least I may be wrong\u2014but it\u2019s an idea.",
    "Suppose\nsome one wanted badly to prevent your going to Chimneys\u201d\n\n\u201cMy cousin George Lomax does\u201d said Virginia with a smile.",
    "\u201cBut I can\u2019t\nseriously suspect George of murder.\u201d\n\nAnthony did not smile.",
    "He was lost in thought.",
    "\u201cIf you ring up the police it\u2019s goodbye to any idea of getting to\nChimneys today\u2014or even tomorrow.",
    "And I should like you to go to\nChimneys.",
    "I fancy it will disconcert our unknown friends.",
    "Mrs. Revel\nwill you put yourself in my hands\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to be Plan B then\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to be Plan B.",
    "The first thing is to get that maid of yours out of\nthe house.",
    "Can you manage that\u201d\n\n\u201cEasily.\u201d\n\nVirginia went out in the hall and called up the stairs.",
    "\u201c\u00c9lise.",
    "\u00c9lise.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame\u201d\n\nAnthony heard a rapid colloquy and then the front door opened and\nshut.",
    "Virginia came back into the room.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s gone.",
    "I sent her for some special scent\u2014told her the shop in\nquestion was open until eight.",
    "It won\u2019t be of course.",
    "She\u2019s to follow\nafter me by the next train without coming back here.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u201d said Anthony approvingly.",
    "\u201cWe can now proceed to the disposal\nof the body.",
    "It\u2019s a timeworn method but I\u2019m afraid I shall have to\nask you if there\u2019s such a thing in the house as a trunk\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course there is.",
    "Come down to the basement and take your choice.\u201d\n\nThere was a variety of trunks in the basement.",
    "Anthony selected a solid\naffair of suitable size.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll attend to this part of it\u201d he said tactfully.",
    "\u201cYou go upstairs\nand get ready to start.\u201d\n\nVirginia obeyed.",
    "She slipped out of her tennis kit put on a soft brown\ntravelling dress and a delightful little orange hat and came down to\nfind Anthony waiting in the hall with a neatly strapped trunk beside\nhim.",
    "\u201cI should like to tell you the story of my life\u201d he remarked \u201cbut\nit\u2019s going to be rather a busy evening.",
    "Now this is what you\u2019ve got\nto do.",
    "Call a taxi have your luggage put on it including the trunk.",
    "Drive to Paddington.",
    "There have the trunk put in the Left Luggage\nOffice.",
    "I shall be on the platform.",
    "As you pass me drop the Cloak\nRoom ticket.",
    "I will pick it up and pretend to return it to you but in\nreality I shall keep it.",
    "Go on to Chimneys and leave the rest to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awfully good of you\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s really dreadful of me\nsaddling a perfect stranger with a dead body like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it\u201d returned Anthony nonchalantly.",
    "\u201cIf one of my friends\nJimmy McGrath were here he\u2019d tell you that anything of this kind\nsuits me down to the ground.\u201d\n\nVirginia was staring at him.",
    "\u201cWhat name did you say Jimmy McGrath\u201d\n\nAnthony returned her glance keenly.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Why Have you heard of him\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014and quite lately.\u201d She paused irresolutely and then went on.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Cade I must talk to you.",
    "Can\u2019t you come down to Chimneys\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see me before very long Mrs. Revel\u2014I\u2019ll tell you that.",
    "Now\nexit Conspirator A by back door slinkingly.",
    "Exit Conspirator B in\nblaze of glory by front door to taxi.\u201d\n\nThe plan went through without a hitch.",
    "Anthony having picked up a\nsecond taxi was on the platform and duly retrieved the fallen ticket.",
    "He then departed in search of a somewhat battered secondhand Morris\nCowley which he had acquired earlier in the day in case it should be\nnecessary to his plans.",
    "Returning to Paddington in this he handed the ticket to the porter\nwho got the trunk out of the cloak room and wedged it securely at the\nback of the car.",
    "Anthony drove off.",
    "His objective now was out of London.",
    "Through Notting Hill Shepherd\u2019s\nBush down Goldhawk Road through Brentford and Hounslow till he came\nto the long stretch of road midway between Hounslow and Staines.",
    "It was a wellfrequented road with motors passing continually.",
    "No\nfootmarks or tyre marks were likely to show.",
    "Anthony stopped the car at\na certain spot.",
    "Getting down he first obscured the numberplate with\nmud.",
    "Then waiting until he heard no car coming in either direction\nhe opened the trunk heaved out Giuseppe\u2019s body and laid it neatly\ndown by the side of the road on the inside of a curve so that the\nheadlights of passing motors would not strike on it.",
    "Then he entered the car again and drove away.",
    "The whole business had\noccupied exactly one minute and a half.",
    "He made a d\u00e9tour to the right\nreturning to London by way of Burnham Beeches.",
    "There again he halted\nthe car and choosing a giant of the forest he deliberately climbed the\nhuge tree.",
    "It was something of a feat even for Anthony.",
    "To one of the\ntopmost branches he affixed a small brownpaper parcel concealing it\nin a little niche close to the bole.",
    "\u201cA very clever way of disposing of the pistol\u201d said Anthony to himself\nwith some approval.",
    "\u201cEverybody hunts about on the ground and drags\nponds.",
    "But there are very few people in England who could climb that\ntree.\u201d\n\nNext back to London and Paddington Station.",
    "Here he left the trunk\u2014at\nthe other cloak room this time the one on the Arrival side.",
    "He thought\nlongingly of such things as good rumpsteaks juicy chops and large\nmasses of fried potatoes.",
    "But he shook his head ruefully glancing at\nhis wrist watch.",
    "He fed the Morris with a fresh supply of petrol and\nthen took the road once more.",
    "North this time.",
    "It was just after halfpast eleven that he brought the car to rest in\nthe road adjoining the park of Chimneys.",
    "Jumping out he scaled the wall\neasily enough and set out towards the house.",
    "It took him longer than\nhe thought and presently he broke into a run.",
    "A great grey mass loomed\nup out of the darkness\u2014the venerable pile of Chimneys.",
    "In the distance\na stable clock chimed the three quarters.",
    "11.45\u2014the time mentioned on the scrap of paper.",
    "Anthony was on the\nterrace now looking up at the house.",
    "Everything seemed dark and quiet.",
    "\u201cThey go to bed early these politicians\u201d he murmured to himself.",
    "And suddenly a sound smote upon his ears\u2014the sound of a shot.",
    "Anthony\nspun round quickly.",
    "The sound had come from within the house\u2014he was\nsure of that.",
    "He waited a minute but everything was still as death.",
    "Finally he went up to one of the long French windows from where he\njudged the sound that had startled him had come.",
    "He tried the handle.",
    "It was locked.",
    "He tried some of the other windows listening intently\nall the while.",
    "But the silence remained unbroken.",
    "In the end he told himself that he must have imagined the sound or\nperhaps mistaken a stray shot coming from a poacher in the woods.",
    "He\nturned and retraced his steps across the park vaguely dissatisfied and\nuneasy.",
    "He looked back at the house and whilst he looked a light sprang up in\none of the windows on the first floor.",
    "In another minute it went out\nagain and the whole place was in darkness once more.",

    "I beg your pardon my lord I didn\u2019t quite hear\nwhat you said\u201d\n\nLong pause during which the inspector listens quite a variety of\nexpressions passing over his usually impassive countenance.",

    "\u201cWhere\u2019s the body\u201d asked the doctor in curt businesslike fashion.",
    "Lord Caterham turned to him as though relieved at being asked a direct\nquestion.",
    "\u201cIn the council chamber\u2014just where it was found\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have it\ntouched.",
    "I believed\u2014er\u2014that that was the correct thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite right my lord\u201d said the inspector approvingly.",
    "He produced a notebook and pencil.",
    "\u201cAnd who discovered the body Did you\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Lord no\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t think I usually get up\nat this unearthly hour in the morning do you No a housemaid found\nit.",
    "She screamed a good deal I believe.",
    "I didn\u2019t hear her myself.",
    "Then\nthey came to me about it and of course I got up and came down\u2014and\nthere it was you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou recognized the body as that of one of your guests\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right inspector.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy name\u201d\n\nThis perfectly simple question seemed to upset Lord Caterham.",
    "He\nopened his mouth once or twice and then shut it again.",
    "Finally he\nasked feebly.",
    "\u201cDo you mean\u2014do you mean\u2014what was his name\u201d\n\n\u201cYes my lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Lord Caterham looking slowly round the room as though\nhoping to gain inspiration.",
    "\u201cHis name was\u2014I should say it was\u2014yes\ndecidedly so\u2014Count Stanislaus.\u201d\n\nThere was something so odd about Lord Caterham\u2019s manner that the\ninspector ceased using his pencil and stared at him instead.",
    "But at\nthat moment a diversion occurred which seemed highly welcome to the\nembarrassed peer.",
    "The door opened and a girl came into the room.",
    "She was tall slim and\ndark with an attractive boyish face and a very determined manner.",
    "This was Lady Eileen Brent commonly known as Bundle Lord Caterham\u2019s\neldest daughter.",
    "She nodded to the others and addressed her father\ndirectly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got him\u201d she announced.",
    "For a moment the inspector was on the point of starting forward\nunder the impression that the young lady had captured the murderer\nredhanded but almost immediately he realized that her meaning was\nquite different.",
    "Lord Caterham uttered a sigh of relief.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a good job.",
    "What did he say\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming over at once.",
    "We are to \u2018use the utmost discretion.\u2019\u201d\n\nHer father made a sound of annoyance.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s just the sort of idiotic thing George Lomax would say.",
    "However\nonce he comes I shall wash my hands of the whole affair.\u201d\n\nHe appeared to cheer up a little at the prospect.",
    "\u201cAnd the name of the murdered man was Count Stanislaus\u201d queried the\ndoctor.",
    "A lightning glance passed between father and daughter and then the\nformer said with some dignity\n\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "I said so just now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked because you didn\u2019t seem quite sure about it before\u201d explained\nCartwright.",
    "There was a faint twinkle in his eye and Lord Caterham looked at him\nreproachfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the Council Chamber\u201d he said more briskly.",
    "They followed him the inspector bringing up the rear and darting\nsharp glances all around him as he went much as though he expected to\nfind a clue in a picture frame or behind a door.",
    "Lord Caterham took a key from his pocket and unlocked a door flinging\nit open.",
    "They all passed into a big room panelled in oak with three\nlong windows giving on the terrace.",
    "There was a long refectory table\nand a good many oak chests and some beautiful old chairs.",
    "On the walls\nwere various paintings of dead and gone Caterhams and others.",
    "Near the lefthand wall about halfway between the door and the\nwindow a man was lying on his back his arms flung wide.",
    "Dr. Cartwright went over and knelt down by the body.",
    "The inspector\nstrode across to the windows and examined them in turn.",
    "The centre\none was closed but not fastened.",
    "On the steps outside were footprints\nleading up to the window and a second set going away again.",
    "\u201cClear enough\u201d said the inspector with a nod.",
    "\u201cBut there ought to be\nfootprints on the inside as well.",
    "They\u2019d show up plain on this parquet\nfloor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I can explain that\u201d interposed Bundle.",
    "\u201cThe housemaid had\npolished half the floor this morning before she saw the body.",
    "You\nsee it was dark when she came in here.",
    "She went straight across to\nthe windows drew the curtains and began on the floor and naturally\ndidn\u2019t see the body which is hidden from that side of the room by the\ntable.",
    "She didn\u2019t see it until she came right on top of it.\u201d\n\nThe inspector nodded.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Lord Caterham eager to escape.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll leave you here\ninspector.",
    "You\u2019ll be able to find me if you\u2014er\u2014want me.",
    "But Mr.\nGeorge Lomax is coming over from Wyverne Abbey shortly and he\u2019ll be\nable to tell you far more than I could.",
    "It\u2019s his business really.",
    "I\ncan\u2019t explain but he will when he comes.\u201d\n\nLord Caterham beat a precipitate retreat without waiting for a reply.",
    "\u201cToo bad for Lomax\u201d he complained.",
    "\u201cLetting me in for this.",
    "What\u2019s the\nmatter Tredwell\u201d\n\nThe whitehaired butler was hovering deferentially at his elbow.",
    "\u201cI have taken the liberty my lord of advancing the breakfast hour as\nfar as you are concerned.",
    "Everything is ready in the diningroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose for a minute I can eat anything\u201d said Lord Caterham\ngloomily turning his footsteps in that direction.",
    "\u201cNot for a moment.\u201d\n\nBundle slipped her hand through his arm and they entered the\ndiningroom together.",
    "On the sideboard were half a score of heavy\nsilver dishes ingeniously kept hot by patent arrangements.",
    "\u201cOmelet\u201d said Lord Caterham lifting each lid in turn.",
    "\u201cEggs and\nbacon kidneys devilled bird haddock cold ham cold pheasant.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t like any of these things Tredwell ask the cook to poach me an\negg will you\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good my lord.\u201d\n\nTredwell withdrew.",
    "Lord Caterham in an absentminded fashion helped\nhimself plentifully to kidneys and bacon poured himself out a cup of\ncoffee and sat down at the long table.",
    "Bundle was already busy with a\nplateful of eggs and bacon.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m damned hungry\u201d said Bundle with her mouth full.",
    "\u201cIt must be the\nexcitement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you\u201d complained her father.",
    "\u201cYou young people\nlike excitement.",
    "But I\u2019m in a very delicate state of health.",
    "Avoid all\nworry that\u2019s what Sir Abner Willis said\u2014avoid all worry.",
    "So easy for\na man sitting in his consultingroom in Harley Street to say that.",
    "How\ncan I avoid worry when that ass Lomax lands me with a thing like this\nI ought to have been firm at the time.",
    "I ought to have put my foot\ndown.\u201d\n\nWith a sad shake of the head Lord Caterham rose and carved himself a\nplate of ham.",
    "\u201cCodders has certainly done it this time\u201d observed Bundle cheerfully.",
    "\u201cHe was almost incoherent over the telephone.",
    "He\u2019ll be here in a minute\nor two spluttering nineteen to the dozen about discretion and hushing\nit up.\u201d\n\nLord Caterham groaned at the prospect.",
    "\u201cWas he up\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cHe told me\u201d replied Bundle \u201cthat he had been up and dictating\nletters and memoranda ever since seven o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cProud of it too\u201d remarked her father.",
    "\u201cExtraordinarily selfish\nthese public men.",
    "They make their wretched secretaries get up at the\nmost unearthly hours in order to dictate rubbish to them.",
    "If a law was\npassed compelling them to stop in bed until eleven what a benefit it\nwould be to the nation I wouldn\u2019t mind so much if they didn\u2019t talk\nsuch balderdash.",

    "Who wants to be a peer nowadays\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019d much rather keep a prosperous public\nhouse.\u201d\n\nTredwell reappeared silently with two poached eggs in a little silver\ndish which he placed on the table in front of Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s that Tredwell\u201d said the latter looking at them with faint\ndistaste.",
    "\u201cPoached eggs my lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate poached eggs\u201d said Lord Caterham peevishly.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re so\ninsipid.",
    "I don\u2019t like to look at them even.",
    "Take them away will you\nTredwell\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good my lord.\u201d\n\nTredwell and the poached eggs withdrew as silently as they came.",
    "\u201cThank God no one gets up early in this house\u201d remarked Lord Caterham\ndevoutly.",
    "\u201cWe shall have to break this to them when they do I suppose.\u201d\n\nHe sighed.",
    "\u201cI wonder who murdered him\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cAnd why\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not our business thank goodness\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s\nfor the police to find out.",
    "Not that Badgworthy will ever find out\nanything.",
    "On the whole I rather hope it was Nosystein.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe All British Syndicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should Mr. Isaacstein murder him when he\u2019d come down here on\npurpose to meet him\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh finance\u201d said Lord Caterham vaguely.",
    "\u201cAnd that reminds me I\nshouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if Isaacstein wasn\u2019t an early riser.",
    "He\nmay blow in upon us at any minute.",
    "It\u2019s a habit in the city.",
    "I believe\nthat however rich you are you always catch the 9.17.\u201d\n\nThe sound of a motor being driven at great speed was heard through the\nopen window.",
    "\u201cCodders\u201d cried Bundle.",
    "Father and daughter leaned out of the window and hailed the occupant of\nthe car as it drew up before the entrance.",
    "\u201cIn here my dear fellow in here\u201d cried Lord Caterham hastily\nswallowing his mouthful of ham.",
    "George had no intention of climbing in through the window.",
    "He\ndisappeared through the front door and reappeared ushered in by\nTredwell who withdrew at once.",
    "\u201cHave some breakfast\u201d said Lord Caterham shaking him by the hand.",
    "\u201cWhat about a kidney\u201d\n\nGeorge waved the kidney aside impatiently.",
    "\u201cThis is a terrible calamity terrible terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is indeed.",
    "Some haddock\u201d\n\n\u201cNo no.",
    "It must be hushed up\u2014at all costs it must be hushed up.\u201d\n\nAs Bundle had prophesied George began to splutter.",
    "\u201cI understand your feelings\u201d said Lord Caterham sympathetically.",

    "\u201cAnd take some food.",
    "What you need\nis some food to pull you together.",
    "Poached eggs now There were some\npoached eggs here a minute or two ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any food\u201d said George.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve had breakfast and even if\nI hadn\u2019t had any I shouldn\u2019t want it.",
    "We must think what is to be done.",
    "You have told no one as yet\u201d\n\n\u201cWell there\u2019s Bundle and myself.",
    "And the local police.",
    "And Cartwright.",
    "And all the servants of course.\u201d\n\nGeorge groaned.",
    "\u201cPull yourself together my dear fellow\u201d said Lord Caterham kindly.",
    "\u201cI wish you\u2019d have some breakfast.",

    "It\u2019s got be buried and all that sort of\nthing.",
    "Very unfortunate but there it is.\u201d\n\nGeorge became suddenly calm.",
    "\u201cYou are right Caterham.",
    "You have called in the local police you say\nThat will not do.",
    "We must have Battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cBattle murder and sudden death\u201d inquired Lord Caterham with a\npuzzled face.",
    "\u201cNo no you misunderstand me.",
    "I referred to Superintendent Battle of\nScotland Yard.",
    "A man of the utmost discretion.",
    "He worked with us in\nthat deplorable business of the Party Funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was that\u201d asked Lord Caterham with some interest.",
    "But George\u2019s eye had fallen upon Bundle as she sat half in and half\nout of the window and he remembered discretion just in time.",
    "He rose.",
    "\u201cWe must waste no time.",
    "I must send off some wires at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you write them out Bundle will send them through the telephone.\u201d\n\nGeorge pulled out a fountain pen and began to write with incredible\nrapidity.",
    "He handed the first one to Bundle who read it with a great\ndeal of interest.",
    "\u201cGod what a name\u201d she remarked.",
    "\u201cBaron How Much\u201d\n\n\u201cBaron Lolopretjzyl.\u201d\n\nBundle blinked.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got it but it will take some conveying to the post office.\u201d\n\nGeorge continued to write.",
    "Then he handed his labours to Bundle and\naddressed the master of the house\n\n\u201cThe best thing that you can do Caterham\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d said Lord Caterham apprehensively.",
    "\u201cIs to leave everything in my hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly\u201d said Lord Caterham with alacrity.",
    "\u201cJust what I was\nthinking myself.",
    "You\u2019ll find the police and Dr. Cartwright in the\nCouncil Chamber.",
    "With the\u2014er\u2014with the body you know.",
    "My dear Lomax\nI place Chimneys unreservedly at your disposal.",
    "Do anything you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d said George.",
    "\u201cIf I should want to consult you\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Lord Caterham had faded unobtrusively through the farther door.",
    "Bundle had observed his retreat with a grim smile.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll send off those telegrams at once\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou know your way\nto the Council Chamber\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Lady Eileen.\u201d\n\nGeorge hurried from the room.",
    "11\n\nSuperintendent Battle Arrives\n\n\nSo apprehensive was Lord Caterham of being consulted by George that he\nspent the whole morning making a tour of his estate.",
    "Only the pangs of\nhunger drew him homeward.",
    "He also reflected that by now the worst would\nsurely be over.",
    "He sneaked into the house quietly by a small side door.",
    "From there he\nslipped neatly into his sanctum.",
    "He flattered himself that his entrance\nhad not been observed but there he was mistaken.",
    "The watchful Tredwell\nlet nothing escape him.",
    "He presented himself at the door.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me my lord\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it Tredwell\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Lomax my lord is anxious to see you in the library as soon as\nyou return.\u201d\n\nBy this delicate method Tredwell conveyed that Lord Caterham had not\nyet returned unless he chose to say so.",
    "Lord Caterham sighed and then rose.",
    "\u201cI suppose it will have to be done sooner or later.",
    "In the library you\nsay\u201d\n\n\u201cYes my lord.\u201d\n\nSighing again Lord Caterham crossed the wide spaces of his ancestral\nhome and reached the library door.",
    "The door was locked.",
    "As he rattled\nthe handle it was unlocked from inside opened a little way and the\nface of George Lomax appeared peering out suspiciously.",
    "His face changed when he saw who it was.",
    "\u201cAh Caterham come in.",
    "We were just wondering what had become of you.\u201d\n\nMurmuring something vague about duties on the estate repairs for\ntenants Lord Caterham sidled in apologetically.",
    "There were two other\nmen in the room.",
    "One was Colonel Melrose the Chief Constable.",
    "The\nother was a squarely built middleaged man with a face so singularly\ndevoid of expression as to be quite remarkable.",
    "\u201cSuperintendent Battle arrived half an hour ago\u201d explained George.",
    "\u201cHe\nhas been round with Inspector Badgworthy and seen Dr. Cartwright.",
    "He\nnow wants a few facts from us.\u201d\n\nThey all sat down after Lord Caterham had greeted Melrose and\nacknowledged his introduction to Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cI need hardly tell you Battle\u201d said George \u201cthat this is a case in\nwhich we must use the utmost discretion.\u201d\n\nThe superintendent nodded in an offhand manner that rather took Lord\nCaterham\u2019s fancy.",
    "\u201cThat will be all right Mr. Lomax.",
    "But no concealments from us.",
    "I\nunderstand that the dead gentleman was called Count Stanislaus\u2014at\nleast that that is the name by which the household knew him.",
    "Now was\nthat his real name\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was his real name\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince Michael of Herzoslovakia.\u201d\n\nBattle\u2019s eyes opened just a trifle otherwise he gave no sign.",
    "\u201cAnd what if I may ask the question was the purpose of his visit\nhere Just pleasure\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a further object Battle.",
    "All this in the strictest\nconfidence of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes yes Mr. Lomax.\u201d\n\n\u201cColonel Melrose\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then Prince Michael was here for the express purpose of meeting\nMr. Herman Isaacstein.",
    "A loan was to be arranged on certain terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich were\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know the exact details.",
    "Indeed they had not yet been\narranged.",
    "But in the event of coming to the throne Prince Michael\npledged himself to grant certain oil concessions to those companies in\nwhich Mr. Isaacstein is interested.",
    "The British Government was prepared\nto support the claim of Prince Michael to the throne in view of his\npronounced British sympathies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Superintendent Battle \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I need go further\ninto it than that.",
    "Prince Michael wanted the money Mr. Isaacstein\nwanted oil and the British Government was ready to do the heavy\nfather.",
    "Just one question.",
    "Was anyone else after those concessions\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe an American group of financiers had made overtures to His\nHighness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd been turned down eh\u201d\n\nBut George refused to be drawn.",
    "\u201cPrince Michael\u2019s sympathies were entirely proBritish\u201d he repeated.",
    "Superintendent Battle did not press the point.",
    "\u201cLord Caterham I understand that this is what occurred yesterday.",
    "You\nmet Prince Michael in town and journeyed down here in company with him.",
    "The Prince was accompanied by his valet a Herzoslovakian named Boris\nAnchoukoff but his equerry Captain Andrassy remained in town.",
    "The\nPrince on arriving declared himself greatly fatigued and retired to\nthe apartments set aside for him.",
    "Dinner was served to him there and\nhe did not meet the other members of the house party.",
    "Is that correct\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis morning a housemaid discovered the body at approximately 7.45\nA.M. Dr. Cartwright examined the dead man and found that death was the\nresult of a bullet fired from a revolver.",
    "No revolver was found and no\none in the house seems to have heard the shot.",
    "On the other hand the\ndead man\u2019s wrist watch was smashed by the fall and marks the crime as\nhaving been committed at exactly a quarter to twelve.",
    "Now what time\ndid you retire to bed last night\u201d\n\n\u201cWe went early.",
    "Somehow or other the party didn\u2019t seem to \u2018go\u2019 if you\nknow what I mean superintendent.",
    "We went up about halfpast ten I\nshould say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.",
    "Now I will ask you Lord Caterham to give me a description\nof all the people staying in the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut excuse me I thought the fellow who did it came from outside\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Battle smiled.",
    "\u201cI dare say he did.",
    "I dare say he did.",
    "But all the same I\u2019ve got to\nknow who was in the house.",
    "Matter of routine you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell there was Prince Michael and his valet and Mr. Herman\nIsaacstein.",
    "You know all about them.",
    "Then there was Mr. Eversleigh\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho works in my department\u201d put in George condescendingly.",
    "\u201cAnd who was acquainted with the real reason of Prince Michael\u2019s being\nhere\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I should not say that\u201d replied George weightily.",
    "\u201cDoubtless\nhe realized that something was in the wind but I did not think it\nnecessary to take him fully into my confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.",
    "Will you go on Lord Caterham\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me see there was Mr. Hiram Fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is Mr. Hiram Fish\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Fish is an American.",
    "He brought over a letter of introduction from\nMr. Lucius Gott\u2014you\u2019ve heard of Lucius Gott\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Battle smiled acknowledgment.",
    "Who had not heard of\nLucius C. Gott the multimillionaire\n\n\u201cHe was specially anxious to see my first editions.",
    "Mr. Gott\u2019s\ncollection is of course unequalled but I\u2019ve got several treasures\nmyself.",
    "This Mr.",
    "Fish was an enthusiast.",
    "Mr. Lomax had suggested that\nI ask one or two extra people down here this weekend to make things\nseem more natural so I took the opportunity of asking Mr.",
    "Fish.",
    "That\nfinishes the men.",
    "As for the ladies there is only Mrs. Revel\u2014and I\nexpect she brought a maid or something like that.",
    "Then there was my\ndaughter and of course the children and their nurses and governesses\nand all the servants.\u201d\n\nLord Caterham paused and took a breath.",
    "\u201cThank you\u201d said the detective.",
    "\u201cA mere matter of routine but\nnecessary as such.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt I suppose\u201d asked George ponderously \u201cthat the\nmurderer entered by the window\u201d\n\nBattle paused for a minute before replying slowly.",
    "\u201cThere were footsteps leading up to the window and footsteps leading\naway from it.",
    "A car stopped outside the park at 11.40 last night.",
    "At\ntwelve o\u2019clock a young man arrived at the Jolly Cricketers in a car\nand engaged a room.",
    "He put his boots outside to be cleaned\u2014they were\nvery wet and muddy as though he had been walking through the long\ngrass in the park.\u201d\n\nGeorge leant forward eagerly.",
    "\u201cCould not the boots be compared with the footprints\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\n\u201cThey exactly correspond.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat settles it\u201d cried George.",
    "\u201cWe have the murderer.",
    "The young\nman\u2014what is his name by the way\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the inn he gave the name of Anthony Cade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Anthony Cade must be pursued at once and arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t need to pursue him\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s still there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cCurious isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\nColonel Melrose eyed him keenly.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s in your mind Battle Out with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just say it\u2019s curious that\u2019s all.",
    "Here\u2019s a young man who ought to\ncut and run but he doesn\u2019t cut and run.",
    "He stays here and gives us\nevery facility for comparing footmarks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think then\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think.",
    "And that\u2019s a very disturbing state of\nmind.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you imagine\u2014\u2014\u201d began Colonel Melrose but broke off as a discreet\nknock came at the door.",
    "George rose and went to it.",
    "Tredwell inwardly suffering from having to\nknock at doors in this low fashion stood dignified upon the threshold\nand addressed his master.",
    "\u201cExcuse me my lord but a gentleman wishes to see you on urgent and\nimportant business connected I understand with this morning\u2019s\ntragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name\u201d asked Battle suddenly.",
    "\u201cHis name sir is Mr. Anthony Cade but he said it wouldn\u2019t convey\nanything to anybody.\u201d\n\nIt seemed to convey something to the four men present.",
    "They all sat up\nin varying degrees of astonishment.",
    "Lord Caterham began to chuckle.",

    "\u201cEnter suspicious stranger from village inn\u201d said Anthony.",
    "He made his way toward Lord Caterham with a kind of instinct rare in\nstrangers.",
    "At the same time he summed up the other three men in his\nown mind thus \u201c1 Scotland Yard.",
    "2 Local dignitary\u2014probably chief\nconstable.",
    "3 Harassed gentleman on the verge of apoplexy\u2014possibly\nconnected with the Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must apologize\u201d continued Anthony still addressing Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cFor forcing my way in like this I mean.",
    "But it was rumoured round the\nJolly Dog or whatever the name of your local pub may be that you\nhad had a murder up here and as I thought I might be able to throw\nsome light upon it I came along.\u201d\n\nFor a moment or two no one spoke.",
    "Superintendent Battle because he was\na man of ripe experience who knew how infinitely better it was to let\nevery one else speak if they could be persuaded upon to do so Colonel\nMelrose because he was habitually taciturn George because he was in\nthe habit of having notice given him of the question Lord Caterham\nbecause he had not the least idea of what to say.",
    "The silence of the\nother three however and the fact that he had been directly addressed\nfinally forced speech upon the last named.",
    "\u201cEr\u2014quite so\u2014quite so\u201d he said nervously.",
    "\u201cWon\u2019t\u2014you\u2014er\u2014sit down\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d said Anthony.",
    "George cleared his throat portentously.",
    "\u201cEr\u2014when you say you can throw light upon this matter you mean\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean\u201d said Anthony \u201cthat I was trespassing upon Lord Caterham\u2019s\nproperty for which I hope he will forgive me last night at about\n11.45 and that I actually heard the shot fired.",
    "I can at any rate fix\nthe time of the crime for you.\u201d\n\nHe looked round at the three in turn his eyes resting longest on\nSuperintendent Battle the impassivity of whose face he seemed to\nappreciate.",
    "\u201cBut I hardly think that that\u2019s news to you\u201d he added gently.",
    "\u201cMeaning by that Mr. Cade\u201d asked Battle.",
    "\u201cJust this.",
    "I put on shoes when I got up this morning.",
    "Later when I\nasked for my boots I couldn\u2019t have them.",
    "Some nice young constable had\ncalled round for them.",
    "So I naturally put two and two together and\nhurried up here to clear my character if possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very sensible move\u201d said Battle noncommittally.",
    "Anthony\u2019s eyes twinkled a little.",
    "\u201cI appreciate your reticence inspector.",
    "It is inspector isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\nLord Caterham interposed.",
    "He was beginning to take a fancy to Anthony.",
    "\u201cSuperintendent Battle of Scotland Yard.",
    "This is Colonel Melrose our\nChief Constable and Mr. Lomax.\u201d\n\nAnthony looked sharply at George.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "George Lomax\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Mr. Lomax\u201d said Anthony \u201cthat I had the pleasure of\nreceiving a letter from you yesterday.\u201d\n\nGeorge stared at him.",
    "\u201cI think not\u201d he said coldly.",
    "But he wished that Miss Oscar were here.",
    "Miss Oscar wrote all his\nletters for him and remembered who they were to and what they were\nabout.",
    "A great man like George could not possibly remember all these\nannoying details.",
    "\u201cI think Mr. Cade\u201d he hinted \u201cthat you were about to give us\nsome\u2014er\u2014explanation of what you were doing in the grounds last night\nat 11.45\u201d\n\nHis tone said plainly \u201cAnd whatever it may be we are not likely to\nbelieve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Mr. Cade what were you doing\u201d said Lord Caterham with lively\ninterest.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Anthony regretfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s rather a long story.\u201d\n\nHe drew out his cigarette case.",
    "\u201cMay I\u201d\n\nLord Caterham nodded and Anthony lit a cigarette and braced himself\nfor the ordeal.",
    "He was aware none better of the peril in which he stood.",
    "In the short\nspace of twentyfour hours he had become embroiled in two separate\ncrimes.",
    "His actions in connection with the first would not bear looking\ninto for a second.",
    "After deliberately disposing of one body and so\ndefeating the aims of justice he had arrived upon the scene of the\nsecond crime at the exact moment when it was being committed.",
    "For a\nyoung man looking for trouble he could hardly have done better.",
    "\u201cSouth America\u201d thought Anthony to himself \u201csimply isn\u2019t in it with\nthis\u201d\n\nHe had already decided upon his course of action.",
    "He was going to tell\nthe truth\u2014with one trifling alteration and one grave suppression.",
    "\u201cThe story begins\u201d said Anthony \u201cabout three weeks ago\u2014in Bulawayo.",
    "Mr. Lomax of course knows where that is\u2014outpost of the Empire\u2014\u2018What\ndo we know of England who only England know\u2019 all that sort of thing.",
    "I\nwas conversing with a friend of mine a Mr. James McGrath\u2014\u201d\n\nHe brought out the name slowly with a thoughtful eye on George.",
    "George\nbounded in his seat and repressed an exclamation with difficulty.",
    "\u201cThe upshot of our conversation was that I came to England to carry\nout a little commission for Mr. McGrath who was unable to go himself.",
    "Since the passage was booked in his name I travelled as James\nMcGrath.",
    "I don\u2019t know what particular kind of offence that was\u2014the\nsuperintendent can tell me I dare say and run me in for so many\nmonths\u2019 hard if necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get on with the story if you please sir\u201d said Battle but his\neyes twinkled a little.",
    "\u201cOn arrival in London I went to the Blitz Hotel still as James\nMcGrath.",
    "My business in London was to deliver a certain manuscript to a\nfirm of publishers but almost immediately I received deputations from\nthe representatives of two political parties of a foreign kingdom.",
    "The\nmethods of one were strictly constitutional the methods of the other\nwere not.",
    "I dealt with them both accordingly.",
    "But my troubles were not\nover.",
    "That night my room was broken into and an attempt at burglary\nwas made by one of the waiters at the hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was not reported to the police I think\u201d said Superintendent\nBattle.",
    "\u201cYou are right.",
    "It was not.",
    "Nothing was taken you see.",
    "But I did\nreport the occurrence to the manager of the hotel and he will confirm\nmy story and tell you that the waiter in question decamped rather\nabruptly in the middle of the night.",
    "The next day the publishers\nrang me up and suggested that one of their representatives would\ncall upon me and receive the manuscript.",
    "I agreed to this and the\narrangement was duly carried out on the following morning.",
    "Since I\nhave heard nothing further I presume the manuscript reached them\nsafely.",
    "Yesterday still as James McGrath I received a letter from Mr.\nLomax\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nAnthony paused.",
    "He was by now beginning to enjoy himself.",
    "George\nshifted uneasily.",
    "\u201cI remember\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cSuch a large correspondence.",
    "The name of\ncourse being different I could not be expected to know.",
    "And I may\nsay\u201d George\u2019s voice rose a little firm in the assurance of moral\nstability \u201cthat I consider this\u2014this\u2014masquerading as another man in\nthe highest degree improper.",
    "I have no doubt no doubt whatever that\nyou have incurred a severe legal penalty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this letter\u201d continued Anthony unmoved \u201cMr.",
    "Lomax made various\nsuggestions concerning the manuscript in my charge.",
    "He also extended an\ninvitation to me from Lord Caterham to join the house party here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelighted to see you my dear fellow\u201d said that nobleman.",
    "\u201cBetter\nlate than never\u2014eh\u201d\n\nGeorge frowned at him.",
    "Superintendent Battle bent an unmoved eye upon Anthony.",
    "\u201cAnd is that your explanation of your presence here last night sir\u201d\nhe asked.",
    "\u201cCertainly not\u201d said Anthony warmly.",
    "\u201cWhen I am asked to stay at a\ncountryhouse I don\u2019t scale the wall late at night tramp across the\npark and try the downstairs windows.",
    "I drive up to the front door\nring the bell and wipe my feet on the mat.",
    "I will proceed.",
    "I replied to\nMr. Lomax\u2019s letter explaining that the manuscript had passed out of\nmy keeping and therefore regretfully declining Lord Caterham\u2019s kind\ninvitation.",
    "But after I had done so I remembered something which had\nup till then escaped my memory.\u201d He paused.",
    "The moment had come for\nskating over thin ice.",
    "\u201cI must tell you that in my struggle with the\nwaiter Giuseppe I had wrested from him a small bit of paper with some\nwords scribbled on it.",
    "They had conveyed nothing to me at the time but\nI still had them and the mention of Chimneys recalled them to me.",
    "I\ngot the torn scrap out and looked at it.",
    "It was as I had thought.",
    "Here\nis the piece of paper gentlemen you can see for yourselves.",
    "The words\non it are \u2018Chimneys 11.45 Thursday.\u2019\u201d\n\nBattle examined the paper attentively.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d continued Anthony \u201cthe word Chimneys might have nothing\nwhatever to do with this house.",
    "On the other hand it might.",
    "And\nundoubtedly this Giuseppe was a thieving rascal.",
    "I made up my mind to\nmotor down here last night satisfy myself that all was as it should\nbe put up at the inn and call upon Lord Caterham in the morning and\nput him on his guard in case some mischief should be intended during\nthe weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so\u201d said Lord Caterham encouragingly.",
    "\u201cQuite so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was late in getting here\u2014had not allowed enough time.",
    "Consequently\nI stopped the car climbed over the wall and ran across the park.",
    "When\nI arrived on the terrace the whole house was dark and silent.",
    "I was\njust turning away when I heard a shot.",
    "I fancied that it came from\ninside the house and I ran back crossed the terrace and tried the\nwindows.",
    "But they were fastened and there was no sound of any kind\nfrom inside the house.",
    "I waited a while but the whole place was still\nas the grave so I made up my mind that I had made a mistake and that\nwhat I had heard was a stray poacher\u2014quite a natural conclusion to\ncome to under the circumstances I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite natural\u201d said Superintendent Battle expressionlessly.",
    "\u201cI went on to the inn put up as I said\u2014and heard the news\nthis morning.",
    "I realized of course that I was a suspicious\ncharacter\u2014bound to be under the circumstances and came up here to\ntell my story hoping it wasn\u2019t going to be handcuffs for one.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause.",
    "Colonel Melrose looked sideways at Superintendent\nBattle.",
    "\u201cI think the story seems clear enough\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be handing out any handcuffs\nthis morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny questions Battle\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like to know.",
    "What was this manuscript\u201d\n\nHe looked across at George and the latter replied with a trace of\nunwillingness\n\n\u201cThe Memoirs of the late Count Stylptitch.",
    "You see\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t say anything more\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI see perfectly.\u201d\n\nHe turned to Anthony.",
    "\u201cDo you know who it was that was shot Mr. Cade\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the Jolly Dog it was understood to be a Count Stanislaus or some\nsuch name.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him\u201d said Battle laconically to George Lomax.",
    "George was clearly reluctant but he was forced to speak\n\n\u201cThe gentleman who was staying here incognito as Count Stanislaus was\nHis Highness Prince Michael of Herzoslovakia.\u201d\n\nAnthony whistled.",
    "\u201cThat must be deuced awkward\u201d he remarked.",
    "Superintendent Battle who had been watching Anthony closely gave a\nshort grunt as though satisfied of something and rose abruptly to his\nfeet.",
    "\u201cThere are one or two questions I\u2019d like to ask Mr. Cade\u201d he\nannounced.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll take him into the Council Chamber with me if I may.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly certainly\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cTake him anywhere you\nlike.\u201d\n\nAnthony and the detective went out together.",
    "The body had been removed from the scene of the tragedy.",
    "There was a\ndark stain on the floor where it had lain but otherwise there was\nnothing to suggest that a tragedy had ever occurred.",
    "The sun poured in\nthrough the three windows flooding the room with light and bringing\nout the mellow tone of the old panelling.",
    "Anthony looked around him\nwith approval.",
    "\u201cVery nice\u201d he commented.",
    "\u201cNothing much to beat old England is there\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it seem to you at first it was in this room the shot was fired\u201d\nasked the superintendent not replying to Anthony\u2019s eulogium.",
    "\u201cLet me see.\u201d\n\nAnthony opened the window and went out on the terrace looking up at\nthe house.",
    "\u201cYes that\u2019s the room all right\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s built out and\noccupies all the corner.",
    "If the shot had been fired anywhere else it\nwould have sounded from the left but this was from behind me or to\nthe right if anything.",
    "That\u2019s why I thought of poachers.",
    "It\u2019s at the\nextremity of the wing you see.\u201d\n\nHe stepped back across the threshold and asked suddenly as though the\nidea had just struck him\n\n\u201cBut why do you ask You know he was shot here don\u2019t you\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said the superintendent.",
    "\u201cWe never know as much as we\u2019d like to\nknow.",
    "But yes he was shot here all right.",
    "Now you said something\nabout trying the windows didn\u2019t you\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "They were fastened from the inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many of them did you try\u201d\n\n\u201cAll three of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure of that sir\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the habit of being sure.",
    "Why do you ask\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a funny thing\u201d said the superintendent.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s a funny thing\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the crime was discovered this morning the middle one was\nopen\u2014not latched that is to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhew\u201d said Anthony sinking down on the window seat and taking\nout his cigarette case.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s rather a blow.",
    "That opens up quite\na different aspect of the case.",
    "It leaves us two alternatives.",
    "Either he was killed by some one in the house and that some one\nunlatched the window after I had gone to make it look like an outside\njob\u2014incidentally with me as Little Willie\u2014or else not to mince\nmatters I\u2019m lying.",
    "I dare say you incline to the second possibility\nbut upon my honour you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to leave this house until I\u2019m through with them I can\ntell you that\u201d said Superintendent Battle grimly.",
    "Anthony looked at him keenly.",
    "\u201cHow long have you had the idea that it might be an inside job\u201d he\nasked.",
    "Battle smiled.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve had a notion that way all along.",
    "Your trail was a bit\ntoo\u2014flaring if I may put it that way.",
    "As soon as your boots fitted\nthe footmarks I began to have my doubts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI congratulate Scotland Yard\u201d said Anthony lightly.",
    "But at that moment the moment when Battle apparently admitted\nAnthony\u2019s complete absence of complicity in the crime Anthony felt\nmore than ever the need of being upon his guard.",
    "Superintendent Battle\nwas a very astute officer.",
    "It would not do to make any slip with\nSuperintendent Battle about.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s where it happened I suppose\u201d said Anthony nodding towards\nthe dark patch upon the floor.",
    "\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was he shot with\u2014a revolver\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but we shan\u2019t know what make until they get the bullet out at the\nautopsy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t found then\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t found.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo clues of any kind\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we\u2019ve got this.\u201d\n\nRather after the manner of a conjurer Superintendent Battle produced\na halfsheet of notepaper.",
    "And as he did so he again watched Anthony\nclosely without seeming to do so.",
    "But Anthony recognized the design upon it without any sign of\nconsternation.",
    "\u201cAha Comrades of the Red Hand again.",
    "If they\u2019re going to scatter this\nsort of thing about they ought to have it lithographed.",
    "It must be a\nfrightful nuisance doing every one separately.",
    "Where was this found\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderneath the body.",
    "You\u2019ve seen it before sir\u201d\n\nAnthony recounted to him in detail his short encounter with that\npublicspirited association.",
    "\u201cThe idea is I suppose that the Comrades did him in.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it likely sir\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it would be in keeping with their propaganda.",
    "But I\u2019ve always\nfound that those who talk most about blood have never actually seen\nit run.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t have said the Comrades had the guts myself.",
    "And\nthey\u2019re such picturesque people too.",
    "I don\u2019t see one of them disguising\nhimself as a suitable guest for a country house.",
    "Still one never\nknows.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite right Mr. Cade.",
    "One never knows.\u201d\n\nAnthony looked suddenly amused.",
    "\u201cI see the big idea now.",
    "Open window trail of footprints suspicious\nstranger at village inn.",
    "But I can assure you my dear superintendent\nthat whatever I am I am not the local agent of the Red Hand.\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Battle smiled a little.",
    "Then he played his last card.",
    "\u201cWould you have any objection to seeing the body\u201d he shot out suddenly.",
    "\u201cNone whatever\u201d rejoined Anthony.",
    "Battle took a key from his pocket and preceding Anthony down the\ncorridor paused at a door and unlocked it.",
    "It was one of the smaller\ndrawingrooms.",
    "The body lay on a table covered with a sheet.",
    "Superintendent Battle waited until Anthony was beside him and then\nwhisked away the sheet suddenly.",
    "An eager light sprang into his eyes at the halfuttered exclamation and\nthe start of surprise which the other gave.",
    "\u201cSo you do recognize him Mr. Cade\u201d he said in a voice that he\nstrove to render devoid of triumph.",

    "You see I\u2014or rather\nmy friend Jimmy McGrath has been very neatly done out of a thousand\npounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cA thousand pounds is a nice sum of money\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cIt isn\u2019t the thousand pounds so much\u201d said Anthony \u201cthough I agree\nwith you that it\u2019s a nice sum of money.",
    "It\u2019s being done that maddens\nme.",
    "I handed over that manuscript like a little woolly lamb.",

    "The superintendent was bent\nforward listening.",
    "Enjoining silence on Anthony with a gesture he tiptoed noiselessly to\nthe door and flung it suddenly open.",
    "On the threshold stood a tall man with black hair neatly parted in the\nmiddle china blue eyes with a particularly innocent expression and a\nlarge placid face.",
    "\u201cYour pardon gentlemen\u201d he said in a slow drawling voice with a\npronounced transatlantic accent.",
    "\u201cBut is it permitted to inspect the\nscene of the crime I take it that you are both gentlemen from Scotland\nYard\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not that honour\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cBut this gentleman is\nSuperintendent Battle of Scotland Yard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that so\u201d said the American gentleman with a great appearance of\ninterest.",
    "\u201cPleased to meet you sir.",
    "My name is Hiram P. Fish of New\nYork City.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it you wanted to see Mr. Fish\u201d asked the detective.",

    "It is one of my hobbies.",
    "I have\ncontributed a monograph to one of our weekly periodicals on the subject\n\u2018Degeneracy and the Criminal.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs he spoke his eyes went gently round the room seeming to note\neverything in it.",

    "\u201cAha\u201d said Mr.",
    "Fish.",
    "\u201cOur genial host.\u201d\n\nThis was such a ludicrous description of Lord Caterham that Anthony had\nto turn his head away to conceal a smile.",

    "But she is bright\u2014she is very bright.\u201d\n\nWith Lord Caterham was Virginia Revel.",

    "She held out both hands to him.",
    "\u201cSo you found you could come down after all\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Mrs. Revel I had no idea Mr. Cade was a friend of yours\u201d\nsaid Lord Caterham.",

    "I\u2019ll send down to the Cricketers for your bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you Lord Caterham but\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense of course you must come to Chimneys.",
    "Horrible place the\nCricketers\u2014to stay in I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you must come Mr. Cade\u201d said Virginia softly.",
    "Anthony realized the altered tone of his surroundings.",
    "Already Virginia\nhad done much for him.",
    "He was no longer an ambiguous stranger.",
    "Her\nposition was so assured and unassailable that anyone for whom she\nvouched was accepted as a matter of course.",

    "And I don\u2019t know what the devil to do with Isaacstein.",
    "It\u2019s all\nvery unfortunate.\u201d\n\nThe depressed peer sighed heavily.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s settled then\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cYou can begin to be useful\nright away Mr. Cade and take me out on the lake.",
    "It\u2019s very peaceful\nthere and far from crime and all that sort of thing.",
    "Isn\u2019t it awful for\npoor Lord Caterham having a murder done in his house But it\u2019s George\u2019s\nfault really.",
    "This is George\u2019s party you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cBut I should never have listened to him\u201d\n\nHe assumed the air of a strong man betrayed by a single weakness.",
    "\u201cOne can\u2019t help listening to George\u201d said Virginia.",

    "I need support.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate your kindness very much Lord Caterham\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cEspecially\u201d he added \u201cwhen I\u2019m such a suspicious character.",
    "But my\nstaying here makes it easier for Battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what way sir\u201d asked the superintendent.",
    "\u201cIt won\u2019t be so difficult to keep an eye on me\u201d explained Anthony\ngently.",
    "And by the momentary flicker of the superintendent\u2019s eyelids he knew\nthat his shot had gone home.",
    "14\n\nMainly Political and Financial\n\n\nExcept for that involuntary twitch of the eyelids Superintendent\nBattle\u2019s impassivity was unimpaired.",
    "If he had been surprised at\nVirginia\u2019s recognition of Anthony he did not show it.",
    "He and Lord\nCaterham stood together and watched those two go out through the garden\ndoor.",
    "Mr.",
    "Fish also watched them.",
    "\u201cNice young fellow that\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cVurry nice for Mrs. Revel to meet an old friend\u201d murmured the\nAmerican.",
    "\u201cThey have been acquainted some time presoomably\u201d\n\n\u201cSeems so\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cBut I\u2019ve never heard her mention him\nbefore.",
    "Oh by the way Battle Mr. Lomax has been asking for you.",
    "He\u2019s\nin the Blue morningroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good Lord Caterham.",
    "I\u2019ll go there at once.\u201d\n\nBattle found his way to the Blue morningroom without difficulty.",
    "He\nwas already familiar with the geography of the house.",
    "\u201cAh there you are Battle\u201d said Lomax.",
    "He was striding impatiently up and down the carpet.",
    "There was one other\nperson in the room a big man sitting in a chair by the fireplace.",
    "He\nwas dressed in very correct English shooting clothes which nevertheless\nsat strangely upon him.",
    "He had a fat yellow face and black eyes as\nimpenetrable as those of a cobra.",
    "There was a generous curve to the big\nnose and power in the square lines of the vast jaw.",
    "\u201cCome in Battle\u201d said Lomax irritably.",
    "\u201cAnd shut the door behind\nyou.",
    "This is Mr. Herman Isaacstein.\u201d\n\nBattle inclined his head respectfully.",
    "He knew all about Mr. Herman Isaacstein and though the great financier\nsat there silent whilst Lomax strode up and down and talked he knew\nwho was the real power in the room.",
    "\u201cWe can speak more freely now\u201d said Lomax.",
    "\u201cBefore Lord Caterham and\nColonel Melrose I was anxious not to say too much.",
    "You understand\nBattle These things mustn\u2019t get about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cBut they always do more\u2019s the pity.\u201d\n\nJust for a second he saw a trace of a smile on the fat yellow face.",
    "It\ndisappeared as suddenly as it had come.",
    "\u201cNow what do you really think of this young fellow\u2014this Anthony Cade\u201d\ncontinued George.",
    "\u201cDo you still assume him to be innocent\u201d\n\nBattle shrugged his shoulders very slightly.",
    "\u201cHe tells a straight story.",
    "Part of it we shall be able to verify.",
    "On the face of it it accounts for his presence here last night.",
    "I\nshall cable to South Africa of course for information about his\nantecedents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you regard him as cleared of all complicity\u201d\n\nBattle raised a large square hand.",
    "\u201cNot so fast sir.",
    "I never said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your own idea about the crime Superintendent Battle\u201d asked\nIsaacstein speaking for the first time.",
    "His voice was deep and rich and had a certain compelling quality about\nit.",
    "It had stood him in good stead at board meetings in his younger\ndays.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s rather too soon to have ideas Mr. Isaacstein.",
    "I\u2019ve not got\nbeyond asking myself the first question.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s always the same.",
    "Motive.",
    "Who benefits by the death of Prince\nMichael We\u2019ve got to answer that before we can get anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Revolutionary party of Herzoslovakia\u2014\u2014\u201d began George.",
    "Superintendent Battle waved him aside with something less than his\nusual respect.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Comrades of the Red Hand sir if you\u2019re thinking of\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the paper\u2014with the scarlet hand on it\u201d\n\n\u201cPut there to suggest the obvious solution.\u201d\n\nGeorge\u2019s dignity was a little ruffled.",
    "\u201cReally Battle I don\u2019t see how you can be so sure of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBless you Mr. Lomax we know all about the Comrades of the Red Hand.",
    "We\u2019ve had our eye on them ever since Prince Michael landed in England.",
    "That sort of thing is the elementary work of the department.",
    "They\u2019d\nnever be allowed to get within a mile of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with Superintendent Battle\u201d said Isaacstein.",
    "\u201cWe must look\nelsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see sir\u201d said Battle encouraged by his support \u201cwe do know a\nlittle about the case.",
    "If we don\u2019t know who gains by his death we do\nknow who loses by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning\u201d said Isaacstein.",
    "His black eyes were bent upon the detective.",
    "More than ever he\nreminded Battle of a hooded cobra.",
    "\u201cYou and Mr. Lomax not to mention the Loyalist party of Herzoslovakia.",
    "If you\u2019ll pardon the expression sir you\u2019re in the soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally Battle\u201d interposed George shocked to the core.",
    "\u201cGo on Battle\u201d said Isaacstein.",
    "\u201cIn the soup describes the situation\nvery accurately.",
    "You\u2019re an intelligent man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a King.",

    "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to find another in a hurry and\nthat\u2019s not an easy job.",
    "No I don\u2019t want to know the details of your\nscheme the bare outline is enough for me but I take it it\u2019s a big\ndeal\u201d\n\nIsaacstein bent his head slowly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat brings me to my second question.",
    "Who is the next heir to the\nthrone of Herzoslovakia\u201d\n\nIsaacstein looked across at Lomax.",
    "The latter answered the question\nwith a certain reluctance and a good deal of hesitation\n\n\u201cThat would be\u2014I should say\u2014yes in all probability Prince Nicholas\nwould be the next heir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cAnd who is Prince Nicholas\u201d\n\n\u201cA first cousin of Prince Michael\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI should like to hear all about Prince Nicholas\nespecially where he is at present.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing much is known of him\u201d said Lomax.",
    "\u201cAs a young man he was\nmost peculiar in his ideas consorted with Socialists and Republicans\nand acted in a way highly unbecoming to his position.",
    "He was sent down\nfrom Oxford I believe for some wild escapade.",
    "There was a rumour\nof his death two years later in the Congo but it was only a rumour.",
    "He turned up a few months ago when news of the Royalist reaction got\nabout.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cWhere did he turn up\u201d\n\n\u201cIn America.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u201d\n\nBattle turned to Isaacstein with one laconic word\n\n\u201cOil\u201d\n\nThe financier nodded.",
    "\u201cHe represented that if the Herzoslovakians chose a King they would\nprefer him to Prince Michael as being more in sympathy with modern\nenlightened ideas and he drew attention to his early democratic views\nand his sympathy with Republican ideals.",
    "In return for financial\nsupport he was prepared to grant concessions to a certain group of\nAmerican financiers.\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Battle so far forgot his habitual impassivity as to give\nvent to a prolonged whistle.",
    "\u201cSo that is it\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cIn the meantime the Loyalist party\nsupported Prince Michael and you felt sure you\u2019d come out on top.",
    "And\nthen this happens\u201d\n\n\u201cYou surely don\u2019t think\u2014\u2014\u201d began George.",
    "\u201cIt was a big deal\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Isaacstein says so.",
    "And I\nshould say that what he calls a big deal is a big deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are always unscrupulous tools to be got hold of\u201d said\nIsaacstein quietly.",
    "\u201cFor the moment Wall Street wins.",
    "But they\u2019ve not\ndone with me yet.",
    "Find out who killed Prince Michael Superintendent\nBattle if you want to do your country a service.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing strikes me as highly suspicious\u201d put in George.",

    "\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly simple.",
    "He\nstayed in town to make arrangements with a certain lady on behalf of\nPrince Michael for next weekend.",
    "The Baron rather frowned on such\nthings thinking them injudicious at the present stage of affairs so\nHis Highness had to go about them in a hole and corner manner.",

    "\u201cYes I\u2019m afraid so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one other point we ought to take into account I think\u201d said\nBattle speaking with a certain amount of hesitation.",

    "\u201cNo thank you my dear fellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it upset your plans if I returned to London Superintendent\nBattle\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so sir\u201d said the Superintendent civilly.",

    "\u201cI hope you don\u2019t suggest that Michael went to his rooms simply to\navoid seeing me\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething of the kind\u201d admitted Anthony.",
    "\u201cYou see if I\u2019m right in\nmy idea that some one wanted to prevent your coming to Chimneys the\nreason seems to lie in your knowing Herzoslovakia.",
    "Do you realize that\nyou\u2019re the only person here who knew Prince Michael by sight\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean that this man who was murdered was an impostor\u201d asked\nVirginia abruptly.",
    "\u201cThat is the possibility that crossed my mind.",
    "If you can get Lord\nCaterham to show you the body we can clear up that point at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was shot at 11.45\u201d said Virginia thoughtfully.",

    "Why\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply because as I walked away last night after thinking I heard a\nshot the light went up in that room.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow curious I don\u2019t know who has that room but I can find out by\nasking Bundle.",
    "Perhaps they heard the shot\u201d\n\n\u201cIf so they haven\u2019t come forward to say so.",
    "I understood from Battle\nthat nobody in the house heard the shot fired.",
    "It\u2019s the only clue of\nany kind that I\u2019ve got and I dare say it\u2019s a pretty rotten one but I\nmean to follow it up for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s curious certainly\u201d said Virginia thoughtfully.",
    "They had arrived at the boathouse by the lake and had been leaning\nagainst it as they talked.",
    "\u201cAnd now for the whole story\u201d said Anthony.",

    "George\u2014my cousin George Lomax you\nknow\u2014came to see me the other day and suggested a lot of frightfully\nsilly things.",
    "His idea was that I should come down here and make\nmyself agreeable to this man McGrath and Delilah the Memoirs out of\nhim somehow.",
    "He didn\u2019t put it like that of course.",
    "He talked a lot of\nnonsense about English gentlewomen and things like that but his real\nmeaning was never obscure for a moment.",
    "It was just the sort of rotten\nthing poor old George would think of.",
    "And then I wanted to know too\nmuch and he tried to put me off with lies that wouldn\u2019t have deceived\na child of two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell his plan seems to have succeeded anyhow\u201d observed Anthony.",
    "\u201cHere am I the James McGrath he had in mind and here are you being\nagreeable to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut alas for poor old George no Memoirs Now I\u2019ve got a question\nfor you.",

    "\u201cI said\u201d repeated Anthony with a meaning glance at the boathouse\n\u201cthat you won\u2019t get there by water.",
    "There\u2019s a right of way across the\npark\u2014some distance away but all this is the private part.",
    "You\u2019re\ntrespassing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am most sorry\u201d said the stranger.",
    "\u201cI lost my direction entirely.",
    "I\nthought I would come up here and inquire.\u201d\n\nAnthony refrained from pointing out that kneeling behind a boathouse\nwas a somewhat peculiar manner of prosecuting inquiries.",
    "He took the\nstranger kindly by the arm.",
    "\u201cYou go this way\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cRight round the lake and straight on\u2014you\ncan\u2019t miss the path.",
    "When you get on it turn to the left and it will\nlead you to the village.",
    "You\u2019re staying at the Cricketers I suppose\u201d\n\n\u201cI am monsieur.",
    "Since this morning.",
    "Many thanks for your kindness in\ndirecting me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI hope you haven\u2019t caught cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh\u201d said the stranger.",
    "\u201cFrom kneeling on the damp ground I mean\u201d explained Anthony.",
    "\u201cI\nfancied I heard you sneezing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI may have sneezed\u201d admitted the other.",
    "\u201cQuite so\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t suppress a sneeze you\nknow.",
    "One of the most eminent doctors said so only the other day.",
    "It\u2019s frightfully dangerous.",
    "I don\u2019t remember exactly what it does to\nyou\u2014whether it\u2019s an inhibition or whether it hardens your arteries\nbut you must never do it.",
    "Good morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning and thank you monsieur for setting me on the right\nroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond suspicious stranger from village inn\u201d murmured Anthony to\nhimself as he watched the other\u2019s retreating form.",
    "\u201cAnd one that I\ncan\u2019t quite place either.",
    "Appearance that of a French commercial\ntraveller.",
    "I don\u2019t quite see him as a Comrade of the Red Hand.",
    "Does he\nrepresent yet a third party in the harassed state of Herzoslovakia\nThe French governess has the second window from the end.",
    "A mysterious\nFrenchman is found slinking round the grounds listening to\nconversations that are not meant for his ears.",
    "I\u2019ll bet my hat there\u2019s\nsomething in it.\u201d\n\nMusing thus Anthony retraced his steps to the house.",
    "On the terrace\nhe encountered Lord Caterham looking suitably depressed and two new\narrivals.",
    "He brightened a little at the sight of Anthony.",
    "\u201cAh there you are\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cLet me introduce you to\nBaron\u2014er\u2014er\u2014and Captain Andrassy.",
    "Mr. Anthony Cade.\u201d\n\nThe Baron stared at Anthony with growing suspicion.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Cade\u201d he said stiffly.",
    "\u201cI think not.\u201d\n\n\u201cA word alone with you Baron\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI can explain\neverything.\u201d\n\nThe Baron bowed and the two men walked down the terrace together.",
    "\u201cBaron\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI must throw myself upon your mercy.",
    "I have so\nfar strained the honour of an English gentleman as to travel to this\ncountry under an assumed name.",
    "I represented myself to you as Mr. James\nMcGrath\u2014but you must see for yourself that the deception involved\nwas infinitesimal.",
    "You are doubtless acquainted with the works of\nShakespeare and his remarks about the unimportance of the nomenclature\nof roses This case is the same.",
    "The man you wanted to see was the man\nin possession of the Memoirs.",
    "I was that man.",
    "As you know only too\nwell I am no longer in possession of them.",
    "A neat trick.",
    "Baron a very\nneat trick.",
    "Who thought of it you or your principal\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Highness\u2019s own idea it was.",
    "And for anyone but him to carry it out\nhe would not permit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did it jolly well\u201d said Anthony with approval.",
    "\u201cI never took him\nfor anything but an Englishman.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe education of an English gentleman did the Prince receive\u201d\nexplained the Baron.",
    "\u201cThe custom of Herzoslovakia it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo professional could have pinched those papers better\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cMay I ask without indiscretion what has become of them\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween gentlemen\u201d began the Baron.",
    "\u201cYou are too kind Baron\u201d murmured Anthony.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve never been called a\ngentleman so often as I have in the last fortyeight hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI to you say this\u2014I believe them to be burnt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe but you don\u2019t know eh Is that it\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Highness in his own keeping retained them.",
    "His purpose it was to\nread them and then by the fire to destroy them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cAll the same they are not the kind of light\nliterature you\u2019d skim through in half an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong the effects of my martyred master they have not discovered been.",
    "It is clear therefore that burnt they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI wonder\u201d\n\nHe was silent for a minute or two and then went on.",
    "\u201cI have asked you these questions Baron because as you may have\nheard I myself have been implicated in the crime.",
    "I must clear myself\nabsolutely so that no suspicion attaches to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly\u201d said the Baron.",
    "\u201cYour honour demands it.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cYou put these things so well.",
    "I haven\u2019t got\nthe knack of it.",
    "To continue I can only clear myself by discovering\nthe real murderer and to do that I must have all the facts.",
    "This\nquestion of the Memoirs is very important.",
    "It seems to me possible that\nto gain possession of them might be the motive of the crime.",
    "Tell me\nBaron is that a very farfetched idea\u201d\n\nThe Baron hesitated for a moment or two.",
    "\u201cYou yourself the Memoirs have read\u201d he asked cautiously at length.",
    "\u201cI think I am answered\u201d said Anthony smiling.",
    "\u201cNow Baron there\u2019s\njust one thing more.",
    "I should like to give you fair warning that it\nis still my intention to deliver that manuscript to the publishers on\nWednesday next the 13th of October.\u201d\n\nThe Baron stared at him.",
    "\u201cBut you have no longer got it\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday next I said.",
    "Today is Friday.",
    "That gives me five days\nto get hold of it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if it is burnt\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is burnt.",
    "I have good reasons for not believing so.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke they turned the corner of the terrace.",
    "A massive figure was\nadvancing towards them.",
    "Anthony who had not yet seen the great Mr.\nHerman Isaacstein looked at him with considerable interest.",
    "\u201cAh Baron\u201d said Isaacstein waving the big black cigar he was\nsmoking \u201cthis is a bad business\u2014a very bad business.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy good friend Mr. Isaacstein it is indeed\u201d cried the Baron.",
    "\u201cAll\nour noble edifice in ruins is.\u201d\n\nAnthony tactfully left the two gentlemen to their lamentations and\nretraced his steps along the terrace.",
    "Suddenly he came to a halt.",
    "A thin spiral of smoke was rising into the\nair apparently from the very centre of the yew hedge.",
    "\u201cIt must be hollow in the middle\u201d reflected Anthony.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve heard of\nsuch things before.\u201d\n\nHe looked swiftly to right and left of him.",
    "Lord Caterham was at the\nfarther end of the terrace with Captain Andrassy.",
    "Their backs were\ntowards him.",
    "Anthony bent down and wriggled his way through the massive\nyew.",
    "He had been quite right in his supposition.",
    "The yew hedge was really\nnot one but two a narrow passage divided them.",
    "The entrance to this\nwas about halfway up on the side of the house.",
    "There was no mystery\nabout it but no one seeing the yew hedge from the front would have\nguessed at the probability.",
    "Anthony looked down the narrow vista.",
    "About halfway down a man was\nreclining in a basket chair.",
    "A halfsmoked cigar rested on the arm of\nthe chair and the gentleman himself appeared to be asleep.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said Anthony to himself.",
    "\u201cEvidently Mr. Hiram Fish prefers\nsitting in the shade.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n16\n\nTea in the Schoolroom\n\n\nAnthony regained the terrace with the feeling uppermost in his mind\nthat the only safe place for private conversations was the middle of\nthe lake.",
    "The resonant boom of a gong sounded from the house and Tredwell\nappeared in a stately fashion from a side door.",
    "\u201cLuncheon is served my lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Lord Caterham brisking up a little.",
    "\u201cLunch.\u201d\n\nAt that moment two children burst out of the house.",
    "They were\nhighspirited young women of twelve and ten and though their names\nmight be Dulcie and Daisy as Bundle had affirmed they appeared to be\nmore generally known as Guggle and Winkle.",

    "\u201cHurrah\u201d said Guggle joining in.",
    "Lord Caterham had succeeded in shepherding most of his guests into the\nhouse.",
    "Now he laid a restraining hand on Anthony\u2019s arm.",
    "\u201cCome to my study\u201d he breathed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got something rather special\nthere.\u201d\n\nSlinking down the hall far more like a thief than like the master of\nthe house Lord Caterham gained the shelter of his sanctum.",
    "Here he\nunlocked a cupboard and produced various bottles.",
    "\u201cTalking to foreigners always makes me so thirsty\u201d he explained\napologetically.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know why it is.\u201d\n\nThere was a knock on the door and Virginia popped her head round the\ncorner of it.",
    "\u201cGot a special cocktail for me\u201d she demanded.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d said Lord Caterham hospitably.",
    "\u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nThe next few minutes were taken up with serious rites.",

    "\u201cAs I said just now I find talking to foreigners\nparticularly fatiguing.",

    "Come\nalong.",
    "Let\u2019s have some lunch.\u201d\n\nHe led the way to the diningroom.",

    "All the same I mean to see\nMademoiselle before the day is out.\u201d\n\nLunch was somewhat of an ordeal.",
    "Even the cheerful impartiality of\nBundle failed to reconcile the heterogeneous assembly.",
    "The Baron and\nAndrassy were correct formal full of etiquette and had the air of\nattending a meal in a mausoleum.",
    "Lord Caterham was lethargic and\ndepressed.",

    "George very\nmindful of the trying position in which he found himself conversed\nweightily with the Baron and Mr. Isaacstein.",

    "To this Mr.",

    "Be careful or they\u2019ll rope you in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rather fond of children\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI might teach them some\nnice quiet intellectual game.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d\n\nHaving relinquished Bundle to the care of her gallant captain Anthony\nstrolled off to where various shrill cries disturbed the peace of the\nafternoon.",
    "He was received with acclamation.",
    "\u201cAre you any good at playing Red Indians\u201d asked Guggle sternly.",
    "\u201cRather\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cYou should hear the noise I make when I\u2019m\nbeing scalped.",
    "Like this.\u201d He illustrated.",
    "\u201cNot so bad\u201d said Winkle grudgingly.",
    "\u201cNow do the scalper\u2019s yell.\u201d\n\nAnthony obliged with a bloodcurdling noise.",
    "In another minute the game\nof Red Indians was in full swing.",
    "About an hour later Anthony wiped his forehead and ventured to\ninquire after Mademoiselle\u2019s migraine.",
    "He was pleased to hear that\nthat lady had entirely recovered.",
    "So popular had he become that he was\nurgently invited to come and have tea in the schoolroom.",
    "\u201cAnd then you can tell us about the man you saw hung\u201d urged Guggle.",
    "\u201cDid you say you\u2019d got a bit of the rope with you\u201d asked Winkle.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s in my suitcase\u201d said Anthony solemnly.",
    "\u201cYou shall each have a\npiece of it.\u201d\n\nWinkle immediately let out a Wild Indian yell of satisfaction.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go and get washed I suppose\u201d said Guggle gloomily.",
    "\u201cYou will come to tea won\u2019t you You won\u2019t forget\u201d\n\nAnthony swore solemnly that nothing should prevent his keeping the\nengagement.",
    "Satisfied the youthful pair beat a retreat towards the\nhouse.",
    "Anthony stood for a minute looking after them and as he did\nso he became aware of a man leaving the other side of a little copse\nof trees and hurrying away across the park.",
    "He felt almost sure that it\nwas the same blackbearded stranger he had encountered that morning.",
    "Whilst he was hesitating whether to go after him or not the trees just\nahead of him were parted and Mr. Hiram Fish stepped out into the open.",
    "He stared slightly when he saw Anthony.",
    "\u201cA peaceful afternoon Mr. Fish\u201d inquired the latter.",
    "\u201cI thank you yes.\u201d\n\nMr.",
    "Fish did not look as peaceful as usual however.",
    "His face was\nflushed and he was breathing hard as though he had been running.",
    "He\ndrew out his watch and consulted it.",
    "\u201cI guess\u201d he said softly \u201cit\u2019s just about time for your British\ninstitution of afternoon tea.\u201d\n\nClosing his watch with a snap Mr.",
    "Fish ambled gently away in the\ndirection of the house.",
    "Anthony stood in a brown study and awoke with a start to the fact that\nSuperintendent Battle was standing beside him.",
    "Not the faintest sound\nhad heralded his approach and he seemed literally to have materialized\nfrom space.",
    "\u201cWhere did you spring from\u201d asked Anthony irritably.",
    "With a slight jerk of his head Battle indicated the little copse of\ntrees behind them.",
    "\u201cIt seems a popular spot this afternoon\u201d remarked Anthony.",
    "\u201cYou were very lost in thought Mr. Cade\u201d\n\n\u201cI was indeed.",
    "Do you know what I was doing Battle I was trying to\nput two and one and five and three together so as to make four.",
    "And it\ncan\u2019t be done Battle it simply can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s difficulties that way\u201d agreed the detective.",
    "\u201cBut you\u2019re just the man I wanted to see.",
    "Battle I want to go away.",
    "Can it be done\u201d\n\nTrue to his creed Superintendent Battle showed neither emotion nor\nsurprise.",
    "His reply was easy and matter of fact.",
    "\u201cThat depends sir as to where you want to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you exactly Battle.",
    "I\u2019ll lay my cards upon the table.",
    "I want to go to Dinard to the Chateau of Madame la Comtesse de\nBreteuil.",
    "Can it be done\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen do you want to go Mr. Cade\u201d\n\n\u201cSay tomorrow after the inquest.",
    "I could be back here by Sunday\nevening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d said the superintendent with peculiar solidity.",
    "\u201cWell what about it\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no objection provided you go where you say you\u2019re going and\ncome straight back here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a man in a thousand Battle.",
    "Either you have taken an\nextraordinary fancy to me or else you\u2019re extraordinarily deep.",
    "Which is\nit\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Battle smiled a little but did not answer.",
    "\u201cWell well\u201d said Anthony \u201cI expect you\u2019ll take your precautions.",
    "Discreet minions of the law will follow my suspicious footsteps.",
    "So be\nit.",
    "But I do wish I knew what it was all about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get you Mr. Cade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Memoirs\u2014what all the fuss is about.",
    "Were they only Memoirs Or\nhave you got something up your sleeve\u201d\n\nBattle smiled again.",
    "\u201cTake it like this.",
    "I\u2019m doing you a favour because you\u2019ve made a\nfavourable impression on me Mr. Cade.",
    "I\u2019d like you to work in with\nme over this case.",
    "The amateur and the professional they go well\ntogether.",
    "The one has the intimacy so to speak and the other the\nexperience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Anthony slowly \u201cI don\u2019t mind admitting that I\u2019ve always\nwanted to try my hand at unravelling a murder mystery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny ideas about the case at all Mr. Cade\u201d\n\n\u201cPlenty of them\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cBut they\u2019re mostly questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for instance\u201d\n\n\u201cWho steps into the murdered Michael\u2019s shoes It seems to me that that\nis important\u201d\n\nA rather wry smile came over Superintendent Battle\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d think of that sir.",
    "Prince Nicolas Obolovitch is\nthe next heir\u2014first cousin of this gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd where is he at the present moment\u201d asked Anthony turning away\nto light a cigarette.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know Battle because I\nshan\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reason to believe that he\u2019s in the United States.",
    "He was until\nquite lately at all events.",
    "Raising money on his expectations.\u201d\n\nAnthony gave vent to a surprised whistle.",
    "\u201cI get you\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cMichael was backed by England Nicholas\nby America.",

    "\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI almost dare swear that I know what you were\ndoing in that copse.\u201d\n\nThe detective smiled but made no reply.",
    "\u201cInternational politics are very fascinating\u201d said Anthony \u201cbut I\nfear I must leave you.",
    "I have an appointment in the schoolroom.\u201d\n\nHe strode briskly away towards the house.",
    "Inquiries of the dignified\nTredwell showed him the way to the schoolroom.",
    "He tapped on the door\nand entered to be greeted by squeals of joy.",
    "Guggle and Winkle immediately rushed at him and bore him in triumph to\nbe introduced to Mademoiselle.",
    "For the first time Anthony felt a qualm.",
    "Mademoiselle Brun was a\nsmall middleaged woman with a sallow face pepper and salt hair and\na budding moustache\n\nAs the notorious foreign adventuress she did not fit into the picture\nat all.",
    "\u201cI believe\u201d said Anthony to himself \u201cI\u2019m making the most utter fool\nof myself.",
    "Never mind I must go through with it now.\u201d\n\nHe was extremely pleasant to Mademoiselle and she on her part\nwas evidently delighted to have a goodlooking young man invade her\nschoolroom.",
    "The meal was a great success.",
    "But that evening alone in the charming bedchamber that had been\nallotted to him Anthony shook his head several times.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m wrong\u201d he said to himself.",
    "\u201cFor the second time I\u2019m wrong.",
    "Somehow or other I can\u2019t get the hang of this thing.\u201d\n\nHe stopped in his pacing of the floor.",

    "The door was being softly opened.",
    "In another minute a man had slipped\ninto the room and stood deferentially by the door.",
    "He was a big fair man squarely built with high Slavonic cheekbones\nand dreamy fanatic eyes.",
    "\u201cWho the devil are you\u201d asked Anthony staring at him.",
    "The man replied in perfect English.",
    "\u201cI am Boris Anchoukoff.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince Michael\u2019s servant eh\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so.",

    "\u201cA faithful sort of dog.",
    "Curious the instincts these fellows have.\u201d\n\nHe rose and paced up and down.",

    "Immediately after the inquest Anthony took an unostentatious departure.",
    "His departure was the one bright spot in the day for Bill Eversleigh.",
    "George Lomax obsessed with the fear that something damaging to his\nDepartment might leak out had been exceedingly trying.",
    "Miss Oscar and\nBill had been in constant attendance.",
    "Everything useful and interesting\nhad been done by Miss Oscar.",
    "Bill\u2019s part had been to run to and fro\nwith countless messages to decode telegrams and to listen by the hour\nto George repeating himself.",
    "It was a completely exhausted young man who retired to bed on Saturday\nnight.",
    "He had had practically no chance to talk to Virginia all\nday owing to George\u2019s exactions and he felt injured and illused.",
    "Thank goodness that Colonial fellow had taken himself off.",
    "He had\nmonopolized far too much of Virginia\u2019s society anyway.",
    "And of course\nif George Lomax went on making an ass of himself like this\u2014\u2014 His\nmind seething with resentment Bill fell asleep.",
    "And in dreams came\nconsolation.",
    "For he dreamt of Virginia.",
    "It was an heroic dream a dream of burning timbers in which he played\nthe part of the gallant rescuer.",
    "He brought down Virginia from the\ntopmost story in his arms.",
    "She was unconscious.",
    "He laid her on the\ngrass.",
    "Then he went off to find a packet of sandwiches.",
    "It was most\nimportant that he should find that packet of sandwiches.",

    "The car would not start.",
    "No petrol in the tank He was getting\ndesperate.",
    "And then a big General \u2019bus drew up and Virginia got out\nof it on the arm of the bald headed Baron.",
    "She was deliciously cool\nand exquisitely dressed in grey.",
    "She came over to him and shook him by\nthe shoulders playfully.",

    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u201d\n\nVirginia gave a sigh of relief.",
    "\u201cThank goodness.",
    "I thought you\u2019d never wake up.",
    "I\u2019ve been shaking you\nand shaking you.",
    "Are you properly awake now\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so\u201d said Bill doubtfully.",

    "In the Council Chamber.",
    "I thought I heard a door bang\nsomewhere and I came down to see.",
    "And then saw a light in the Council\nChamber.",
    "I crept along the passage and peeped through the crack of the\ndoor.",
    "I couldn\u2019t see much but what I could see was so extraordinary\nthat I felt I must see more.",
    "And then all of a sudden I felt that I\nshould like a nice big strong man with me.",
    "And you were the nicest\nand biggest and strongest man I could think of so I came in and tried\nto wake you up quietly.",
    "But I\u2019ve been ages doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d said Bill.",
    "\u201cAnd what do you want me to do now Get up and\ntackle the burglars\u201d\n\nVirginia wrinkled her brows.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that they are burglars.",
    "Bill it\u2019s very queer\u2014\u2014 But\ndon\u2019t let\u2019s waste time talking.",
    "Get up.\u201d\n\nBill slipped obediently out of bed.",
    "\u201cWait while I don a pair of boots\u2014the big ones with nails in them.",
    "However big and strong I am I\u2019m not going to tackle hardened criminals\nwith bare feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like your pyjamas Bill\u201d said Virginia dreamily.",
    "\u201cBrightness\nwithout vulgarity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re on the subject\u201d remarked Bill reaching for his second\nboot \u201cI like that thingummybob of yours.",
    "It\u2019s a pretty shade of green.",
    "What do you call it It\u2019s not just a dressinggown is it\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a n\u00e9glig\u00e9\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve led such a pure\nlife Bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t\u201d said Bill indignantly.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve just betrayed the fact.",
    "You\u2019re very nice Bill and I like you.",
    "I dare say that tomorrow morning\u2014say about ten o\u2019clock a good safe\nhour for not unduly exciting the emotions\u2014I might even kiss you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always think these things are best carried out on the spur of the\nmoment\u201d suggested Bill.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve other fish to fry\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to put on\na gas mask and a shirt of chain mail shall we start\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready\u201d said Bill.",
    "He wriggled into a lurid silk dressinggown and picked up a poker.",
    "\u201cThe orthodox weapon\u201d he observed.",
    "\u201cCome on\u201d said Virginia \u201cand don\u2019t make a noise.\u201d\n\nThey crept out of the room and along the corridor and then down the\nwide double staircase.",
    "Virginia frowned as they reached the bottom of\nit.",
    "\u201cThose boots of yours aren\u2019t exactly domes of silence are they Bill\u201d\n\n\u201cNails will be nails\u201d said Bill.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m doing my best.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take them off\u201d said Virginia firmly.",
    "Bill groaned.",
    "\u201cYou can carry them in your hand.",
    "I want to see if you can make out\nwhat\u2019s going on in the Council Chamber.",
    "Bill it\u2019s awfully mysterious.",
    "Why should burglars take a man in armour to pieces\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I suppose they can\u2019t take him away whole very well.",
    "They\ndisarticulate him and pack him neatly.\u201d\n\nVirginia shook her head dissatisfied.",
    "\u201cWhat should they want to steal a mouldy old suit of armour for Why\nChimneys is full of treasures that are much easier to take away.\u201d\n\nBill shook his head.",
    "\u201cHow many of them are there\u201d he asked taking a firmer grip of his\npoker.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see properly.",
    "You know what a keyhole is.",
    "And they only had\na flashlight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect they\u2019ve gone by now\u201d said Bill hopefully.",
    "He sat down on the bottom stair and drew off his boots.",
    "Then holding\nthem in his hand he crept along the passage that led to the Council\nChamber Virginia close behind him.",
    "They halted outside the massive oak\ndoor.",
    "All was silent within but suddenly Virginia pressed his arm and\nhe nodded.",
    "A bright light had shown for a minute through the keyhole.",
    "Bill went down on his knees and applied his eye to the orifice.",
    "What\nhe saw was confusing in the extreme.",
    "The scene of the drama that was\nbeing enacted inside was evidently just to the left out of his line\nof vision.",
    "A subdued chink every now and then seemed to point to the\nfact that the invaders were still dealing with the figure in armour.",
    "There were two of these Bill remembered.",
    "They stood together by the\nwall just under the Holbein portrait.",
    "The light of the electric torch\nwas evidently being directed upon the operations in progress.",
    "It\nleft the rest of the room nearly in darkness.",
    "Once a figure flitted\nacross Bill\u2019s line of vision but there was not sufficient light to\ndistinguish anything about it.",
    "It might have been that of a man or a\nwoman.",
    "In a minute or two it flitted back again and then the subdued\nchinking sounded again.",
    "Presently there came a new sound a faint\ntaptap as of knuckles on wood.",
    "Bill sat back on his heels suddenly.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d whispered Virginia.",
    "\u201cNothing.",
    "It\u2019s no good going on like this.",
    "We can\u2019t see anything and\nwe can\u2019t guess what they\u2019re up to.",
    "I must go in and tackle them.\u201d\n\nHe drew on his boots and stood up.",
    "\u201cNow Virginia listen to me.",
    "We\u2019ll open the door as softly as\npossible.",
    "You know where the switch of the electric light is\u201d\n\n\u201cYes just by the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are more than two of them.",
    "There may be only one.",
    "I want to get well into the room.",
    "Then when I say \u2018Go\u2019 I want you to\nswitch on the lights.",
    "Do you understand\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t scream or faint or anything.",
    "I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hero\u201d murmured Virginia.",
    "Bill peered at her suspiciously through the darkness.",
    "He heard a faint\nsound which might have been either a sob or a laugh.",
    "Then he grasped\nthe poker firmly and rose to his feet.",
    "He felt that he was fully alive\nto the situation.",
    "Very softly he turned the handle of the door.",
    "It yielded and swung\ngently inwards.",
    "Bill felt Virginia close beside him.",
    "Together they\nmoved noiselessly into the room.",
    "At the farther end of the room the torch was playing upon the Holbein\npicture.",
    "Silhouetted against it was the figure of a man standing on a\nchair and gently tapping on the panelling His back of course was to\nthem and he merely loomed up as a monstrous shadow.",
    "What more they might have seen cannot be told for at that moment\nBill\u2019s nails squeaked upon the parquet floor.",
    "The man swung round\ndirecting the powerful torch full upon them and almost dazzling them\nwith the sudden glare.",
    "Bill did not hesitate.",
    "\u201cGo\u201d he roared to Virginia and sprang for his man as she obediently\npressed down the switch of the electric lights.",
    "The big chandelier should have been flooded with light but instead\nall that happened was the click of the switch.",
    "The room remained in\ndarkness.",
    "Virginia heard Bill curse freely.",
    "The next minute the air was filled\nwith panting scuffling sounds.",
    "The torch had fallen to the ground and\nextinguished itself in the fall.",
    "There was the sound of a desperate\nstruggle going on in the darkness but as to who was getting the better\nof it and indeed as to who was taking part in it Virginia had no\nidea.",
    "Had there been anyone else in the room besides the man who was\ntapping the panelling There might have been.",
    "Their glimpse had been\nonly a momentary one.",
    "Virginia felt paralysed.",
    "She hardly knew what to do.",
    "She dared not try\nand join in the struggle.",
    "To do so might hamper and not aid Bill.",
    "Her\none idea was to stay in the doorway so that anyone trying to escape\nshould not leave the room that way.",
    "At the same time she disobeyed\nBill\u2019s express instructions and screamed loudly and repeatedly for help.",
    "She heard doors opening upstairs and a sudden gleam of light from the\nhall and the big staircase.",
    "If only Bill could hold his man until help\ncame.",
    "But at that minute there was a final terrific upheaval.",
    "They must have\ncrashed into one of the figures in armour for it fell to the ground\nwith a deafening noise.",
    "Virginia saw dimly a figure springing for the\nwindow and at the same time heard Bill cursing and disengaging himself\nfrom fragments of armour.",
    "For the first time she left her post and rushed wildly for the figure\nat the window.",
    "But the window was already unlatched.",
    "The intruder had\nno need to stop and fumble for it.",
    "He sprang out and raced away down\nthe terrace and round the corner of the house.",
    "Virginia raced after\nhim.",
    "She was young and athletic and she turned the corner of the\nterrace not many seconds after her quarry.",
    "But there she ran headlong into the arms of a man who was emerging from\na small side door.",
    "It was Mr. Hiram P. Fish.",
    "\u201cGee It\u2019s a lady\u201d he exclaimed.",
    "\u201cWhy I beg your pardon Mrs. Revel.",
    "I took you for one of the thugs fleeing from justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just passed this way\u201d cried Virginia breathlessly.",
    "\u201cCan\u2019t we\ncatch him\u201d\n\nBut even as she spoke she knew it was too late.",
    "The man must have\ngained the park by now and it was a dark night with no moon.",
    "She\nretraced her steps to the Council Chamber Mr.",
    "Fish by her side\ndiscoursing in a soothing monotone upon the habits of burglars in\ngeneral of which he seemed to have a wide experience.",
    "Lord Caterham Bundle and various frightened servants were standing in\nthe doorway of the Council Chamber.",
    "\u201cWhat the devil\u2019s the matter\u201d asked Bundle.",
    "\u201cIs it burglars What are\nyou and Mr.",
    "Fish doing Virginia Taking a midnight stroll\u201d\n\nVirginia explained the events of the evening.",
    "\u201cHow frightfully exciting\u201d commented Bundle.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t usually get\na murder and a burglary crowded into one weekend.",
    "What\u2019s the matter\nwith the lights in here They\u2019re all right everywhere else.\u201d\n\nThat mystery was soon explained.",
    "The bulbs had simply been removed\nand laid in a row against the wall.",
    "Mounted on a pair of steps the\ndignified Tredwell dignified even in undress restored illumination to\nthe stricken apartment.",
    "\u201cIf I am not mistaken\u201d said Lord Caterham in his sad voice as he\nlooked around him \u201cthis room has recently been the centre of somewhat\nviolent activity.\u201d\n\nThere was some justice in the remark.",
    "Everything that could have\nbeen knocked over had been knocked over.",
    "The floor was littered with\nsplintered chairs broken china and fragments of armour.",
    "\u201cHow many of them were there\u201d asked Bundle.",
    "\u201cIt seems to have been a\ndesperate fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly one I think\u201d said Virginia.",
    "But even as she spoke she\nhesitated a little.",
    "Certainly only one person\u2014a man\u2014had passed out\nthrough the window.",
    "But as she had rushed after him she had had a\nvague impression of a rustle somewhere close at hand.",
    "If so the second\noccupant of the room could have escaped through the door.",
    "Perhaps\nthough the rustle had been an effect of her own imagination.",
    "Bill appeared suddenly at the window.",
    "He was out of breath and panting\nhard.",
    "\u201cDamn the fellow\u201d he exclaimed wrathfully.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s escaped.",

    "Not a sign of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheer up Bill\u201d said Virginia \u201cbetter luck next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Lord Caterham \u201cwhat do you think we\u2019d better do now Go\nback to bed I can\u2019t get hold of Badgworthy at this time of night.",
    "Tredwell you know the sort of thing that\u2019s necessary.",
    "Just see to it\nwill you\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good my lord.\u201d\n\nWith a sigh of relief Lord Caterham prepared to retreat.",
    "\u201cThat beggar Isaacstein sleeps soundly\u201d he remarked with a touch of\nenvy.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019d have thought all this row would have brought him down.\u201d He\nlooked across at Mr.",
    "Fish.",
    "\u201cYou found time to dress I see\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cI flung on a few articles of clothing yes\u201d admitted the American.",
    "\u201cVery sensible of you\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cDamned chilly things\npyjamas.\u201d\n\nHe yawned.",
    "In a rather depressed mood the house party retired to bed.",
    "18\n\nSecond Midnight Adventure\n\n\nThe first person that Anthony saw as he alighted from his train on the\nfollowing afternoon was Superintendent Battle.",
    "His face broke into a\nsmile.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve returned according to contract\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cDid you come down\nhere to assure yourself of the fact\u201d\n\nBattle shook his head.",
    "\u201cI wasn\u2019t worrying about that Mr. Cade.",
    "I happen to be going to\nLondon that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have such a trustful nature Battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think so sir\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "I think you\u2019re deep\u2014very deep.",
    "Still waters you know and all\nthat sort of thing.",
    "So you\u2019re going to London\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Mr. Cade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder why.\u201d\n\nThe detective did not reply.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re so chatty\u201d remarked Anthony.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what I like about you.\u201d\n\nA faroff twinkle showed in Battle\u2019s eyes.",
    "\u201cWhat about your own little job Mr. Cade\u201d he inquired.",
    "\u201cHow did that\ngo off\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve drawn blank Battle.",
    "For the second time I\u2019ve been proved\nhopelessly wrong.",
    "Galling isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was the idea sir if I may ask\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspected the French governess Battle.",
    "A Upon the grounds of her\nbeing the most unlikely person according to the canons of the best\nfiction.",
    "B Because there was a light in her room on the night of the\ntragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t much to go upon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are quite right.",
    "It was not.",
    "But I discovered that she had only\nbeen here a short time and I also found a suspicious Frenchman spying\nround the place.",
    "You know all about him I suppose\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean the man who calls himself M. Chelles Staying at the\nCricketers A traveller in silk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it is it What about him What does Scotland Yard think\u201d\n\n\u201cHis actions have been suspicious\u201d said Superintendent Battle\nexpressionlessly.",
    "\u201cVery suspicious I should say.",
    "Well I put two and two together.",
    "French governess in the house French stranger outside.",
    "I decided that\nthey were in league together and I hurried off to interview the lady\nwith whom Mademoiselle Brun had lived for the last ten years.",
    "I was\nfully prepared to find that she had never heard of any such person as\nMademoiselle Brun but I was wrong Battle.",
    "Mademoiselle is the genuine\narticle.\u201d\n\nBattle nodded.",
    "\u201cI must admit\u201d said Anthony \u201cthat as soon as I spoke to her I had an\nuneasy conviction that I was barking up the wrong tree.",
    "She seemed so\nabsolutely the governess.\u201d\n\nAgain Battle nodded.",
    "\u201cAll the same Mr. Cade you can\u2019t always go by that.",
    "Women especially\ncan do a lot with make up.",
    "I\u2019ve seen quite a pretty girl with the color\nof her hair altered a sallow complexion stain slightly reddened\neyelids and most efficacious of all dowdy clothes who would fail to\nbe identified by nine people out of ten who had seen her in her former\ncharacter.",
    "Men haven\u2019t got quite the same pull.",
    "You can do something\nwith the eyebrows and of course different sets of false teeth alter\nthe whole expression.",
    "But there are always the ears\u2014there\u2019s an\nextraordinary lot of character in ears Mr. Cade.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so hard at mine Battle\u201d complained Anthony.",
    "\u201cYou make me\nquite nervous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking of false beard and grease paint\u201d continued the\nsuperintendent.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s only for books.",
    "No there are very few men\nwho can escape identification and put it over on you.",
    "In fact there\u2019s\nonly one man I know who has a positive genius for impersonation.",
    "King\nVictor.",
    "Ever heard of King Victor Mr. Cade\u201d\n\nThere was something so sharp and sudden about the way the detective put\nthe question that Anthony half checked the words that were rising to\nhis lips.",
    "\u201cKing Victor\u201d he said reflectively instead.",
    "\u201cSomehow I seem to have\nheard the name.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the most celebrated jewel thieves in the world.",
    "Irish father\nFrench mother.",
    "Can speak five languages at least.",
    "He\u2019s been serving a\nsentence but his time was up a few months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally And where is he supposed to be now\u201d\n\n\u201cWell Mr. Cade that\u2019s what we\u2019d rather like to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe plot thickens\u201d said Anthony lightly.",
    "\u201cNo chance of his turning up\nhere is there But I suppose he wouldn\u2019t be interested in political\nMemoirs\u2014only in jewels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no saying\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cFor all we know he\nmay be here already.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisguised as the second footman Splendid.",
    "You\u2019ll recognize him by his\nears and cover yourself with glory.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite fond of your little joke aren\u2019t you Mr. Cade By the way what\ndo you think of that curious business at Staines\u201d\n\n\u201cStaines\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s been happening at Staines\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was in Saturday\u2019s papers.",
    "I thought you might have seen about it.",
    "Man found by the roadside shot.",
    "A foreigner.",
    "It was in the papers again\ntoday of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did see something about it\u201d said Anthony carelessly.",
    "\u201cNot suicide\napparently.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "There was no weapon.",
    "As yet the man hasn\u2019t been identified.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem very interested\u201d said Anthony smiling.",
    "\u201cNo connection with\nPrince Michael\u2019s death is there\u201d\n\nHis hand was quite steady.",
    "So were his eyes.",
    "Was it his fancy that\nSuperintendent Battle was looking at him with peculiar intentness\n\n\u201cSeems to be quite an epidemic of that sort of thing\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cBut well I dare say there\u2019s nothing in it.\u201d\n\nHe turned away beckoning to a porter as the London train came\nthundering in.",
    "Anthony drew a faint sigh of relief.",
    "He strolled across the park in an unusually thoughtful mood.",
    "He\npurposely chose to approach the house from the same direction as that\nfrom which he had come on the fateful Thursday night and as he drew\nnear to it he looked up at the windows cudgelling his brains to make\nsure of the one where he had seen the light.",
    "Was he quite sure that it\nwas the second from the end\n\nAnd doing so he made a discovery.",
    "There was an angle at the corner of\nthe house in which was a window set farther back.",
    "Standing on one spot\nyou counted this window as the first and the first one built out over\nthe Council Chamber as the second but move a few yards to the right\nand the part built out over the Council Chamber appeared to be the end\nof the house.",
    "The first window was invisible and the two windows of\nthe rooms over the Council Chamber would have appeared the first and\nsecond from the end.",
    "Where exactly had he been standing when he had\nseen the light flash up\n\nAnthony found the question very hard to determine.",
    "A matter of a yard\nor so made all the difference.",
    "But one point was made abundantly clear.",
    "It was quite possible that he had been mistaken in describing the light\nas occurring in the second room from the end.",
    "It might equally well\nhave been the third.",
    "Now who occupied the third room Anthony was determined to find that\nout as soon as possible.",
    "Fortune favoured him.",
    "In the hall Tredwell had\njust set the massive silver urn in its place on the tea tray.",
    "Nobody\nelse was there.",
    "\u201cHullo Tredwell\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI wanted to ask you something.",
    "Who\nhas the third room from the end on the West side Over the Council\nChamber I mean.\u201d\n\nTredwell reflected for a minute or two.",
    "\u201cThat would be the American gentleman\u2019s room sir.",
    "Mr. Fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh is it Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all sir.\u201d\n\nTredwell prepared to depart then paused.",
    "The desire to be the first to\nimpart news makes even pontifical butlers human.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you have heard sir of what occurred last night\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a word\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cWhat did occur last night\u201d\n\n\u201cAn attempt at robbery sir\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really Was anything taken\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir.",
    "The thieves were dismantling the suits of armour in\nthe Council Chamber when they were surprised and forced to flee.",
    "Unfortunately they got clear away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very extraordinary\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cThe Council Chamber again.",
    "Did they break in that way\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is supposed sir that they forced the window.\u201d\n\nSatisfied with the interest his information had aroused Tredwell\nresumed his retreat but brought up short with a dignified apology.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon sir.",
    "I didn\u2019t hear you come in and I didn\u2019t know\nyou were standing just behind me.\u201d\n\nMr. Isaacstein who had been the victim of the impact waved his hand in\na friendly fashion.",
    "\u201cNo harm done my good fellow.",
    "I assure you no harm done.\u201d\n\nTredwell retired looking contemptuous and Isaacstein came forward and\ndropped into an easychair.",
    "\u201cHullo Cade so you\u2019re back again.",
    "Been hearing all about last night\u2019s\nlittle show\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cRather an exciting weekend isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\n\u201cI should imagine that last night was the work of local men\u201d said\nIsaacstein.",
    "\u201cIt seems a clumsy amateurish affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anyone about here who collects armour\u201d asked Anthony.",
    "\u201cIt\nseems a curious thing to select.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery curious\u201d agreed Mr. Isaacstein.",
    "He paused a minute and then\nsaid slowly \u201cThe whole position here is very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nThere was something almost menacing in his tone.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cWhy are we all being kept here in this way The inquest was over\nyesterday.",
    "The Prince\u2019s body will be removed to London where it is\nbeing given out that he died of heart failure.",
    "And still nobody is\nallowed to leave the house.",
    "Mr. Lomax knows no more than I do.",
    "He\nrefers me to Superintendent Battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuperintendent Battle has something up his sleeve\u201d said Anthony\nthoughtfully.",
    "\u201cAnd it seems the essence of his plan that nobody should\nleave.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut excuse me Mr. Cade you have been away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a string tied to my leg.",
    "I\u2019ve no doubt that I was shadowed the\nwhole time.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t have been given a chance of disposing of the\nrevolver or anything of that kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh the revolver\u201d said Isaacstein thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThat has not yet\nbeen found I think\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly thrown into the lake in passing.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery possibly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is Superintendent Battle I have not seen him this afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone to London.",
    "I met him at the station.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone to London Really Did he say when he would be back\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly tomorrow so I understood.\u201d\n\nVirginia came in with Lord Caterham and Mr.",

    "Have you heard all about our adventures last\nnight\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy trooly Mr. Cade\u201d said Hiram Fish.",
    "\u201cIt was a night of strenuous\nexcitement.",
    "Did you hear that I mistook Mrs. Revel for one of the\nthugs\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in the meantime\u201d said Anthony \u201cthe thug\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGot clear away\u201d said Mr.",

    "\u201cCome to the boathouse after tea\u201d she said in a low voice.",
    "\u201cBill and\nI have got a lot to tell you.\u201d\n\nThen she joined lightly in the general conversation.",
    "The meeting at the boathouse was duly held.",
    "Virginia and Bill were bubbling over with their news.",
    "They agreed\nthat a boat in the middle of the lake was the only safe place for\nconfidential conversation.",
    "Having paddled out a sufficient distance\nthe full story of last night\u2019s adventure was related to Anthony.",
    "Bill\nlooked a little sulky.",
    "He wished Virginia would not insist on bringing\nthis Colonial fellow into it.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very odd\u201d said Anthony when the story was finished.",
    "\u201cWhat do\nyou make of it\u201d he asked Virginia.",
    "\u201cI think they were looking for something\u201d she returned promptly.",
    "\u201cThe\nburglar idea is absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey thought the something whatever it was might be concealed in\nthe suits of armour that\u2019s clear enough.",
    "But why tap the panelling\nThat looks more as though they were looking for a secret staircase or\nsomething of that kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Priest\u2019s Hole at Chimneys I know\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cAnd I\nbelieve there\u2019s a secret staircase as well.",
    "Lord Caterham would tell us\nall about it.",
    "What I want to know is what can they have been looking\nfor\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be the Memoirs\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re a great bulky\npackage.",

    "\u201cI wonder whether I could get\nit out of him.",
    "All along I\u2019ve felt there was something behind all this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say there was only one man\u201d pursued Anthony \u201cbut that there\nmight possibly be another as you thought you heard some one going\ntowards the door as you sprang to the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sound was very slight\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cIt might have been just my\nimagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite possible but in case it wasn\u2019t your imagination the\nsecond person must have been an inmate of the house.",
    "I wonder now\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you wondering at\u201d asked Virginia.",
    "\u201cThe thoroughness of Mr. Hiram Fish who dresses himself completely when\nhe hears screams for help downstairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in that\u201d agreed Virginia.",

    "That\u2019s suspicious too.",
    "Surely he\ncouldn\u2019t\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that fellow Boris\u201d suggested Bill.",

    "Eversleigh\nand I will conceal ourselves with due precautions in the Council\nChamber\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about me\u201d interrupted Virginia.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re going to\nleave me out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to me Virginia\u201d said Bill.",
    "\u201cThis is man\u2019s work\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot Bill.",
    "I\u2019m in on this.",
    "Don\u2019t you make any mistake\nabout it.",
    "The syndicate will keep watch tonight.\u201d\n\nIt was settled thus and the details of the plan were laid.",
    "After the\nparty had retired to bed first one and then another of the syndicate\ncrept down.",
    "They were all armed with powerful electric torches and in\nthe pocket of Anthony\u2019s coat lay a revolver.",
    "Anthony had said that he believed another attempt to resume the search\nwould be made.",
    "Nevertheless he did not expect that the attempt would\nbe made from outside.",
    "He believed that Virginia had been correct in her\nguess that some one had passed her in the dark the night before and as\nhe stood in the shadow of an old oak dresser it was towards the door\nand not the window that his eyes were directed.",
    "Virginia was crouching\nbehind a figure in armour on the opposite wall and Bill was by the\nwindow.",
    "The minutes passed at interminable length.",
    "One o\u2019clock chimed then\nthe halfhour then two then another halfhour.",
    "Anthony felt stiff and\ncramped.",
    "He was coming slowly to the conclusion that he had been wrong.",
    "No attempt would be made tonight.",
    "And then he stiffened suddenly all his senses on the alert.",
    "He had\nheard a footstep on the terrace outside.",
    "Silence again then a low\nscratching noise at the window.",
    "Suddenly it ceased and the window\nswung open.",
    "A man stepped across the sill into the room.",
    "He stood quite still for a moment peering round as though listening.",
    "After a minute or two seemingly satisfied he switched on a torch\nhe carried and turned it rapidly round the room.",
    "Apparently he saw\nnothing unusual.",
    "The three watchers held their breath.",
    "He went over to the same bit of panelled wall he had been examining the\nnight before.",
    "And then a terrible knowledge smote Bill.",
    "He was going to sneeze The\nwild race through the dewladen park the night before had given him a\nchill.",
    "All day he had sneezed intermittently.",
    "A sneeze was due now and\nnothing on earth would stop it.",
    "He adopted all the remedies he could think of.",
    "He pressed his upper\nlip swallowed hard threw back his head and looked at the ceiling.",
    "As\na last resort he held his nose and pinched it violently.",
    "It was of no\navail.",
    "He sneezed.",
    "A stifled checked emasculated sneeze but a startling sound in the\ndeadly quiet of the room.",
    "The stranger sprang round and in the same minute Anthony acted.",
    "He\nflashed on his torch and jumped full for the stranger.",
    "In another\nminute they were down on the floor together.",
    "\u201cLights\u201d shouted Anthony.",
    "Virginia was ready at the switch.",
    "The lights came on true and full\ntonight.",
    "Anthony was on top of his man Bill leant down to give him a\nhand.",
    "\u201cAnd now\u201d said Anthony \u201clet\u2019s see who you are my fine fellow.\u201d\n\nHe rolled his victim over.",
    "It was the neat darkbearded stranger from\nthe Cricketers.",
    "\u201cVery nice indeed\u201d said an approving voice.",
    "They all looked up startled.",
    "The bulky form of Superintendent Battle\nwas standing in the open doorway.",
    "\u201cI thought you were in London Superintendent Battle\u201d said Anthony.",
    "Battle\u2019s eyes twinkled.",
    "\u201cDid you sir\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWell I thought it would be a good thing if I\nwas thought to be going.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it has been\u201d agreed Anthony looking down at his prostrate foe.",
    "To his surprise there was a slight smile on the stranger\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cMay I get up gentlemen\u201d he inquired.",
    "\u201cYou are three to one.\u201d\n\nAnthony kindly hauled him on to his legs.",
    "The stranger settled his\ncoat pulled up his collar and directed a keen look at Battle.",
    "\u201cI demand pardon\u201d he said \u201cbut do I understand that you are a\nrepresentative from Scotland Yard\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cThen I will present to you my credentials.\u201d He smiled rather ruefully.",
    "\u201cI would have been wise to do so before.\u201d\n\nHe took some papers from his pocket and handed them to the Scotland\nYard detective.",
    "At the same time he turned back the lapel of his coat\nand showed something pinned there.",
    "Battle gave an exclamation of astonishment.",
    "He looked through the\npapers and handed them back with a little bow.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been manhandled monsieur\u201d he said \u201cbut you\nbrought it on yourself you know.\u201d\n\nHe smiled noting the astonished expression on the faces of the other.",
    "\u201cThis is a colleague we have been expecting for some time\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Lemoine of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 in Paris.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n19\n\nSecret History\n\n\nThey all stared at the French detective who smiled back at them.",
    "\u201cBut yes\u201d he said \u201cit is true.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause for a general readjusting of ideas.",
    "Then Virginia\nturned to Battle.",
    "\u201cDo you know what I think Superintendent Battle\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think Mrs. Revel\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the time has come to enlighten us a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo enlighten you I don\u2019t quite understand Mrs. Revel.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuperintendent Battle you understand perfectly.",
    "I dare say Mr. Lomax\nhas hedged you about with recommendations of secrecy\u2014George would\nbut surely it\u2019s better to tell us than have us stumbling on the secret\nall by ourselves and perhaps doing untold harm.",
    "M. Lemoine don\u2019t you\nagree with me\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame I agree with you entirely.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go on keeping things dark for ever\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve\ntold Mr. Lomax so.",
    "Mr. Eversleigh is Mr. Lomax\u2019s secretary there\u2019s no\nobjection to his knowing what there is to know.",
    "As for Mr. Cade he\u2019s\nbeen brought into the thing willynilly and I consider he\u2019s a right to\nknow where he stands.",
    "But\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nBattle paused.",
    "\u201cI know\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cWomen are so indiscreet I\u2019ve often heard\nGeorge say so.\u201d\n\nLemoine had been studying Virginia attentively.",
    "Now he turned to the\nScotland Yard man.",
    "\u201cDid I hear you just now address Madame by the name of Revel\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is my name\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cYour husband was in the Diplomatic Service was he not And you were\nwith him in Herzoslovakia just before the assassination of the late\nKing and Queen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nLemoine turned again.",
    "\u201cI think Madame has a right to hear the story.",
    "She is indirectly\nconcerned.",
    "Moreover\u201d\u2014his eyes twinkled a little\u2014\u201cMadame\u2019s reputation\nfor discretion stands very high in Diplomatic circles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they give me a good character\u201d said Virginia laughing.",
    "\u201cAnd\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not going to be left out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about refreshments\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cWhere does the conference\ntake place Here\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you please sir\u201d said Battle \u201cI\u2019ve a fancy for not leaving this\nroom until morning.",
    "You\u2019ll see why when you\u2019ve heard the story.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go and forage\u201d said Anthony.",
    "Bill went with him and they returned with a tray of glasses siphons\nand other necessaries of life.",
    "The augmented syndicate established itself comfortably in the corner by\nthe window being grouped round a long oak table.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s understood of course\u201d said Battle \u201cthat anything that\u2019s said\nhere is said in strict confidence.",
    "There must be no leakage.",
    "I\u2019ve\nalways felt it would come out one of these days.",
    "Gentlemen like Mr.\nLomax who want everything hushed up take bigger risks than they think.",
    "The start of this business was just over seven years ago.",
    "There was a\nlot of what they call Reconstruction going on\u2014especially in the Near\nEast.",
    "There was a good deal going on in England strictly on the Q.T.",
    "with that old gentleman Count Stylptitch pulling the strings.",
    "All\nthe Balkan States were interested parties and there were a lot of\nRoyal Personages in England just then.",
    "I\u2019m not going into details\nbut Something disappeared\u2014disappeared in a way that seemed incredible\nunless you admitted two things\u2014that the thief was a Royal Personage\nand that at the same time it was the work of a highclass professional.",
    "M. Lemoine here will tell you how that well might be.\u201d\n\nThe Frenchman bowed courteously and took up the tale.",
    "\u201cIt is possible that you in England may not even have heard of our\nfamous and fantastic King Victor.",
    "What his real name is no one knows\nbut he is a man of singular courage and daring one who speaks five\nlanguages and is unequalled in the art of disguise.",
    "Though his father\nis known to have been either English or Irish he himself has worked\nchiefly in Paris.",
    "It was there nearly eight years ago that he was\ncarrying out a daring series of robberies and living under the name of\nCaptain O\u2019Neill.\u201d\n\nA faint exclamation escaped Virginia.",
    "M. Lemoine darted a keen glance\nat her.",
    "\u201cI think I understand what agitates Madame.",
    "You will see in a minute.",
    "Now we of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 had our suspicions that this Captain O\u2019Neill was\nnone other than \u2018King Victor\u2019 but we could not obtain the necessary\nproof.",
    "There was also in Paris at the time a clever young actress\nAng\u00e8le Mory of the Folies Berg\u00e8res.",
    "For some time we had suspected\nthat she was associated with the operations of King Victor.",
    "But again\nno proof was forthcoming.",
    "\u201cAbout that time Paris was preparing for the visit of the young King\nNicholas IV of Herzoslovakia.",
    "At the S\u00fbret\u00e9 we were given special\ninstructions as to the course to be adopted to ensure the safety of His\nMajesty.",
    "In particular we were warned to superintend the activities of\na certain Revolutionary organization which called itself the Comrades\nof the Red Hand.",
    "It is fairly certain now that the Comrades approached\nAng\u00e8le Mory and offered her a huge sum if she would aid them in their\nplans.",
    "Her part was to infatuate the young King and decoy him to\nsome spot agreed upon with them.",
    "Ang\u00e8le Mory accepted the bribe and\npromised to perform her part.",
    "\u201cBut the young lady was cleverer and more ambitious than her employers\nsuspected.",
    "She succeeded in captivating the King who fell desperately\nin love with her and loaded her with jewels.",
    "It was then that she\nconceived the idea of being\u2014not a King\u2019s mistress but a Queen As\nevery one knows she realized her ambition.",
    "She was introduced into\nHerzoslovakia as the Countess Varaga Popoleffsky an offshoot of the\nRomanoffs and became eventually Queen Varaga of Herzoslovakia.",
    "Not\nbad for a little Parisian actress I have always heard that she played\nthe part extremely well.",
    "But her triumph was not to be long lived.",
    "The\nComrades of the Red Hand furious at her betrayal twice attempted\nher life.",
    "Finally they worked up the country to such a pitch that a\nRevolution broke out in which both the King and Queen perished.",
    "Their\nbodies horribly mutilated and hardly recognizable were recovered\nattesting to the fury of the populace against the lowborn foreign\nQueen.",
    "\u201cNow in all this it seems certain that Queen Varaga still kept in\nwith her confederate King Victor.",
    "It is possible that the bold plan\nwas his all along.",
    "What is known is that she continued to correspond\nwith him in a secret code from the Court of Herzoslovakia.",
    "For safety\nthe letters were written in English and signed with the name of an\nEnglish lady then at the Embassy.",
    "If any inquiry had been made and\nthe lady in question had denied her signature it is possible that she\nwould not have been believed for the letters were those of a guilty\nwoman to her lover.",
    "It was your name she used Mrs. Revel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know\u201d said Virginia.",
    "Her colour was coming and going unevenly.",
    "\u201cSo\nthat is the truth of the letters I have wondered and wondered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a blackguardly trick\u201d cried Bill indignantly.",
    "\u201cThe letters were addressed to Captain O\u2019Neill at his rooms in Paris\nand their principal purpose may have light shed upon it by a curious\nfact which came to light later.",
    "After the assassination of the King\nand Queen many of the Crown Jewels which had fallen of course into\nthe hands of the mob found their way to Paris and it was discovered\nthat in nine cases out of ten the principal stones had been replaced\nby paste\u2014and mind you there were some very famous stones among the\njewels of Herzoslovakia.",
    "So as a Queen Ang\u00e8le Mory still practised her\nformer activities.",
    "\u201cYou see now where we have arrived.",
    "Nicholas IV and Queen Varaga came\nto England and were the guests of the late Marquis of Caterham then\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.",
    "Herzoslovakia is a small\ncountry but it could not be left out.",
    "Queen Varaga was necessarily\nreceived.",
    "And there we have a Royal Personage and at the same time an\nexpert thief.",
    "There is also no doubt that the\u2014er\u2014substitute which was\nso wonderful as to deceive anyone but an expert could only have been\nfashioned by King Victor and indeed the whole plan in its daring and\naudacity pointed to him as the author.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened\u201d asked Virginia.",
    "\u201cHushed up\u201d said Superintendent Battle laconically.",
    "\u201cNot a mention of\nit\u2019s ever been made public to this day.",
    "We did all that could be done\non the quiet\u2014and that was a good deal more than you\u2019d ever imagine by\nthe way.",
    "We\u2019ve got methods of our own that would surprise.",
    "That jewel\ndidn\u2019t leave England with the Queen of Herzoslovakia\u2014I can tell you\nthat much.",
    "No Her Majesty hid it somewhere\u2014but where we\u2019ve never been\nable to discover.",
    "But I shouldn\u2019t wonder\u201d\u2014Superintendent Battle let\nhis eyes wander gently round\u2014\u201cif it wasn\u2019t somewhere in this room.\u201d\n\nAnthony leapt to his feet.",
    "\u201cWhat After all these years\u201d he cried incredulously.",
    "\u201cImpossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not know the peculiar circumstances monsieur\u201d said the\nFrenchman quickly.",
    "\u201cOnly a fortnight later the Revolution in\nHerzoslovakia broke out and the King and Queen were murdered.",
    "Also\nCaptain O\u2019Neill was arrested in Paris and sentenced on a minor charge.",
    "We hoped to find the packet of code letters in his house but it\nappears that this had been stolen by some Herzoslovakian gobetween.",
    "The man turned up in Herzoslovakia just before the Revolution and then\ndisappeared completely.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe probably went abroad\u201d said Anthony thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cTo Africa as\nlikely as not.",
    "And you bet he hung on to that packet.",
    "It was as good\nas a gold mine to him.",
    "It\u2019s odd how things come about.",
    "They probably\ncalled him Dutch Pedro or something like that out there.\u201d\n\nHe caught Superintendent Battle\u2019s expressionless glance bent upon him\nand smiled.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not really clairvoyance Battle\u201d he said \u201cthough it sounds like\nit.",
    "I\u2019ll tell you presently.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is one thing you have not explained\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cWhere does\nthis link up with the Memoirs There must be a link surely\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame is very quick\u201d said Lemoine approvingly.",
    "\u201cYes there is a\nlink.",
    "Count Stylptitch was also staying at Chimneys at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that he might have known about it\u201d\n\n\u201cParfaitement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd of course\u201d said Battle \u201cif he\u2019s blurted it out in his precious\nMemoirs the fat will be in the fire.",
    "Especially after the way the\nwhole thing was hushed up.\u201d\n\nAnthony lit a cigarette.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s no possibility of there being a clue in the Memoirs as to\nwhere the stone was hidden\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cVery unlikely\u201d said Battle decisively.",
    "\u201cHe was never in with the\nQueen\u2014opposed the marriage tooth and nail.",
    "She\u2019s not likely to have\ntaken him into her confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting such a thing for a minute\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cBut\nby all accounts he was a cunning old boy.",
    "Unknown to her he may have\ndiscovered where she hid the jewel.",
    "In that case what would he have\ndone do you think\u201d\n\n\u201cSat tight\u201d said Battle after a moment\u2019s reflection.",
    "\u201cI agree\u201d said the Frenchman.",
    "\u201cIt was a ticklish moment you see.",
    "To\nreturn the stone anonymously would have presented great difficulties.",
    "Also the knowledge of its whereabouts would give him great power\u2014and\nhe liked power that strange old man.",
    "Not only did he hold the Queen\nin the hollow of his hand but he had a powerful weapon to negotiate\nwith at any time.",
    "It was not the only secret he possessed\u2014oh no\u2014he\ncollected secrets like some men collect rare pieces of china.",
    "It is\nsaid that once or twice before his death he boasted to people of the\nthings he could make public if the fancy took him.",
    "And once at least\nhe declared that he intended to make some startling revelations in\nhis Memoirs.",
    "Hence\u201d\u2014the Frenchman smiled rather dryly\u2014\u201cthe general\nanxiety to get hold of them.",
    "Our own secret police intended to seize\nthem but the Count took the precaution to have them conveyed away\nbefore his death.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill there\u2019s no real reason to believe that he knew this particular\nsecret\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon\u201d said Anthony quietly.",
    "\u201cThere are his own words.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\nBoth detectives stared at him as though unable to believe their ears.",
    "\u201cWhen Mr. McGrath gave me that manuscript to bring to England he\ntold me the circumstances of his one meeting with Count Stylptitch.",
    "It was in Paris.",
    "At some considerable risk to himself Mr. McGrath\nrescued the Count from a band of Apaches.",
    "He was I understand\u2014shall\nwe say a trifle\u2014exhilarated Being in that condition he made two\nrather interesting remarks.",
    "One of them was to the effect that he knew\nwhere the Kohinoor was\u2014a statement to which my friend paid very\nlittle attention.",
    "He also said that the gang in question were King\nVictor\u2019s men.",
    "Taken together those two remarks are very significant.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Lord\u201d ejaculated Superintendent Battle \u201cI should say they were.",
    "Even the murder of Prince Michael wears a different aspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing Victor has never taken a life\u201d the Frenchman reminded him.",
    "\u201cSupposing he were surprised when he was searching for the jewel\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he in England then\u201d asked Anthony sharply.",
    "\u201cYou say that he was\nreleased a few months ago.",
    "Didn\u2019t you keep track of him\u201d\n\nA rather rueful smile overspread the French detective\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cWe tried to monsieur.",
    "But he is a devil that man.",
    "He gave us the\nslip at once\u2014at once.",
    "We thought of course that he would make\nstraight for England.",
    "But no.",
    "He went\u2014where do you think\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u201d said Anthony.",
    "He was staring intently at the Frenchman and absentmindedly his\nfingers played with a box of matches.",
    "\u201cTo America.",
    "To the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\nThere was sheer amazement in Anthony\u2019s tone.",
    "\u201cYes and what do you think he called himself What part do you think\nhe played over there The part of Prince Nicholas of Herzoslovakia.\u201d\n\nThe matchbox fell from Anthony\u2019s hand but his amazement was fully\nequalled by that of Battle.",
    "\u201cImpossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so my friend.",
    "You too will get the news in the morning.",
    "It\nhas been the most colossal bluff.",
    "As you know Prince Nicholas was\nrumoured to have died in the Congo years ago.",
    "Our friend King Victor\nseizes on that\u2014difficult to prove a death of that kind.",
    "He resurrects\nPrince Nicholas and plays him to such purpose that he gets away with a\ntremendous haul of American dollars\u2014all on account of the supposed oil\nconcessions.",
    "But by a mere accident he was unmasked and had to leave\nthe country hurriedly.",
    "This time he did come to England.",
    "And that is\nwhy I am here.",
    "Sooner or later he will come to Chimneys.",
    "That is if he\nis not already here\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think\u2014that\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he was here the night Prince Michael died and again last\nnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was another attempt eh\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cIt was another attempt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has bothered me\u201d continued Battle \u201cwas wondering what had\nbecome of M. Lemoine here.",
    "I\u2019d had word from Paris that he was on his\nway over to work with me and I couldn\u2019t make out why he hadn\u2019t turned\nup.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must indeed apologize\u201d said Lemoine.",
    "\u201cYou see I arrived on the\nmorning after the murder.",
    "It occurred to me at once that it would\nbe as well for me to study things from an unofficial standpoint\nwithout appearing officially as your colleague.",
    "I thought that great\npossibilities lay that way.",
    "I was of course aware that I was bound to\nbe an object of suspicion but that in a way furthered my plan since it\nwould not put people I was after on their guard.",
    "I can assure you that\nI have seen a good deal that is interesting in the last two days.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut look here\u201d said Bill \u201cwhat really did happen last night\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid\u201d said M.

    "I will recount things to you.",

    "I stood outside on the terrace.",
    "Presently I became aware\nthat some one was moving about in this room.",
    "I could see the flash of a\ntorch now and again.",
    "I tried the middle window and found it unlatched.",
    "Whether the man had entered that way earlier or whether he had left\nit so as a blind in case he was disturbed I do not know.",
    "Very gently\nI pushed it back and slipped inside the room.",
    "Step by step I felt\nmy way until I was in a spot where I could watch operations without\nlikelihood of being discovered myself.",
    "The man himself I could not see\nclearly.",
    "His back was to me of course and he was silhouetted against\nthe light of the torch so that his outline only could be seen.",
    "But his\nactions filled me with surprise.",
    "He took to pieces first one and then\nthe other of those two suits of armour examining each one piece by\npiece.",
    "When he had convinced himself that what he sought was not there\nhe began tapping the panelling of the wall under that picture.",
    "What he\nwould have done next I do not know.",
    "The interruption came.",
    "You burst\nin\u2014\u2014\u201d He looked at Bill.",
    "\u201cOur wellmeant interference was really rather a pity\u201d said Virginia\nthoughtfully.",
    "\u201cIn a sense madame it was.",
    "The man switched out his torch and I who\nhad no wish as yet to be forced to reveal my identity sprang for the\nwindow.",
    "I collided with the other two in the dark and fell headlong.",
    "I\nsprang up and out through the window.",
    "Mr. Eversleigh taking me for his\nassailant followed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI followed you first\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cBill was only second in the\nrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the other fellow had the sense to stay still and sneak out through\nthe door.",
    "I wonder he didn\u2019t meet the rescuing crowd.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would present no difficulties\u201d said Lemoine.",
    "\u201cHe would be a\nrescuer in advance of the rest that was all.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really think this Ars\u00e8ne Lupin fellow is actually among the\nhousehold now\u201d asked Bill his eyes sparkling.",
    "\u201cWhy not\u201d said Lemoine.",
    "\u201cHe could pass perfectly as a servant.",
    "For all\nwe may know he may be Boris Anchoukoff the trusted servant of the\nlate Prince Michael.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is an oddlooking bloke\u201d agreed Bill.",
    "But Anthony was smiling.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s hardly worthy of you M. Lemoine\u201d he said gently.",
    "The Frenchman smiled too.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve taken him on as your valet now haven\u2019t you Mr. Cade\u201d asked\nSuperintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cBattle I take off my hat to you.",
    "You know everything.",
    "But just as a\nmatter of detail he\u2019s taken me on not I him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy was that I wonder Mr. Cade\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Anthony lightly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a curious taste but\nperhaps he may have liked my face.",
    "Or he may think I murdered his\nmaster and wish to establish himself in a handy position for executing\nrevenge upon me.\u201d\n\nHe rose and went over to the windows pulling the curtains.",
    "\u201cDaylight\u201d he said with a slight yawn.",
    "\u201cThere won\u2019t be any more\nexcitements now.\u201d\n\nLemoine rose also.",
    "\u201cI will leave you\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe shall perhaps meet again later in the\nday.\u201d\n\nWith a graceful bow to Virginia he stepped out of the window.",
    "\u201cBed\u201d said Virginia yawning.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all been very exciting.",
    "Come on\nBill go to bed like a good little boy.",
    "The breakfast table will see us\nnot I fear.\u201d\n\nAnthony stayed at the window looking after the retreating form of M.\nLemoine.",
    "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think it\u201d said Battle behind him \u201cbut that\u2019s supposed\nto be the cleverest detective in France.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I wouldn\u2019t\u201d said Anthony thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI rather\nthink I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Battle \u201che was right about the excitements of this night\nbeing over.",
    "By the way do you remember my telling you about that man\nthey\u2019d found shot near Staines\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Why\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.",
    "They\u2019ve identified him that\u2019s all.",
    "It seems he was called\nGiuseppe Manelli.",
    "He was a waiter at the Blitz in London.",
    "Curious\nisn\u2019t it\u201d\n\n\n\n\n20\n\nBattle and Anthony Confer\n\n\nAnthony said nothing.",
    "He continued to stare out of the window.",
    "Superintendent Battle looked for some time at his motionless back.",
    "\u201cWell good night sir\u201d he said at last and moved to the door.",
    "Anthony stirred.",
    "\u201cWait a minute Battle.\u201d\n\nThe superintendent halted obediently.",
    "Anthony left the window.",
    "He drew\nout a cigarette from his case and lighted it.",
    "Then between two puffs\nof smoke he said\n\n\u201cYou seem very interested in this business at Staines\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go as far as that sir.",
    "It\u2019s unusual that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think the man was shot where he was found or do you think\nhe was killed elsewhere and the body brought to that particular spot\nafterwards\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he was shot somewhere else and the body brought there in a\ncar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so too\u201d said Anthony.",
    "Something in the emphasis of his tone made the detective look up\nsharply.",
    "\u201cAny ideas of your own sir Do you know who brought him there\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI did.\u201d\n\nHe was a little annoyed at the absolutely unruffled calm preserved by\nthe other.",
    "\u201cI must say you take these shocks very well Battle\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201c\u2018Never display emotion.\u2019 That was a rule that was given to me once\nand I\u2019ve found it very useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou live up to it certainly\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever\nseen you ruffled.",
    "Well do you want to hear the whole story\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you please Mr. Cade.\u201d\n\nAnthony pulled up two of the chairs both men sat down and Anthony\nrecounted the events of the preceding Thursday night.",
    "Battle listened immovably.",
    "There was a faroff twinkle in his eyes as\nAnthony finished.",
    "\u201cYou know sir\u201d he said \u201cYou\u2019ll get into trouble one of these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen for the second time I\u2019m not to be taken into custody\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always like to give a man plenty of rope\u201d said Superintendent\nBattle.",
    "\u201cVery delicately put\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cWithout unduly stressing the end\nof the proverb.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I can\u2019t quite make out sir\u201d said Battle \u201cis why you decided to\ncome across with this now\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather difficult to explain\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cYou see Battle\nI\u2019ve come to have really a very high opinion of your abilities.",
    "When\nthe moment comes you\u2019re always there.",
    "Look at tonight.",
    "And it\noccurred to me that in withholding this knowledge of mine I was\nseriously cramping your style.",
    "You deserve to have access to all the\nfacts.",
    "I\u2019ve done what I could and up to now I\u2019ve made a mess of\nthings.",
    "Until tonight I couldn\u2019t speak for Mrs. Revel\u2019s sake.",
    "But now\nthat those letters have been definitely proved to have nothing whatever\nto do with her any idea of her complicity becomes absurd.",
    "Perhaps\nI advised her badly in the first place but it struck me that her\nstatement of having paid this man money to suppress the letters simply\nas a whim might take a bit of believing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might by a jury\u201d agreed Battle.",
    "\u201cJuries never have any\nimagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you accept it quite easily\u201d said Anthony looking curiously at\nhim.",
    "\u201cWell you see Mr. Cade most of my work has lain amongst these\npeople.",
    "What they call the upper classes I mean.",
    "You see the majority\nof people are always wondering what the neighbours will think.",
    "But\ntramps and aristocrats don\u2019t\u2014they just do the first thing that comes\ninto their heads and they don\u2019t bother to think what anyone thinks\nof them.",
    "I\u2019m not meaning just the idle rich the people who give big\nparties and so on I mean those that have had it born and bred in\nthem for generations that nobody else\u2019s opinion counts but their own.",
    "I\u2019ve always found the upper classes the same\u2014fearless truthful and\nsometimes extraordinarily foolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very interesting lecture Battle.",
    "I suppose you\u2019ll be\nwriting your Reminiscences one of these days.",
    "They ought to be worth\nreading too.\u201d\n\nThe detective acknowledged the suggestion with a smile but said\nnothing.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d rather like to ask you one question\u201d continued Anthony.",
    "\u201cDid you\nconnect me at all with the Staines affair I fancied from your manner\nthat you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite right.",
    "I had a hunch that way.",
    "But nothing definite to go upon.",
    "Your manner was very good if I may say so Mr. Cade.",
    "You never overdid\nthe carelessness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad of that\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve a feeling that ever since I met\nyou you\u2019ve been laying little traps for me.",
    "On the whole I\u2019ve managed\nto avoid falling into them but the strain has been acute.\u201d\n\nBattle smiled grimly.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s how you get a crook in the end sir.",
    "Keep him on the run to\nand fro turning and twisting.",
    "Sooner or later his nerve goes and\nyou\u2019ve got him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cheerful fellow Battle.",
    "When will you get me I wonder\u201d\n\n\u201cPlenty of rope sir\u201d quoted the superintendent \u201cplenty of rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the meantime\u201d said Anthony \u201cI am still the amateur assistant\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it Mr. Cade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatson to your Sherlock in fact\u201d\n\n\u201cDetective stories are mostly bunkum\u201d said Battle unemotionally.",
    "\u201cBut\nthey amuse people\u201d he added as an afterthought.",
    "\u201cAnd they\u2019re useful\nsometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what way\u201d asked Anthony curiously.",
    "\u201cThey encourage the universal idea that the police are stupid.",
    "When we\nget an amateur crime such as a murder that\u2019s very useful indeed.\u201d\n\nAnthony looked at him for some minutes in silence.",
    "Battle sat quite\nstill blinking now and then with no expression whatsoever on his\nsquare placid face.",
    "Presently he rose.",
    "\u201cNot much good going to bed now\u201d he observed.",
    "\u201cAs soon as he\u2019s up I\nwant to have a few words with his lordship.",
    "Anyone who wants to leave\nthe house can do so now.",
    "At the same time I should be much obliged to\nhis lordship if he\u2019ll extend an informal invitation to his guests to\nstay on.",
    "You\u2019ll accept it sir if you please and Mrs. Revel also.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever found the revolver\u201d asked Anthony suddenly.",
    "\u201cYou mean the one Prince Michael was shot with No I haven\u2019t.",
    "Yet\nit must be in the house or grounds.",
    "I\u2019ll take a hint from you Mr.\nCade and send some boys up bird\u2019snesting.",
    "If I could get hold of the\nrevolver we might get forward a bit.",
    "That and the bundle of letters.",
    "You say that a letter with the heading Chimneys was amongst them\nDepend upon it that was the last one written.",
    "The instructions for\nfinding the diamond are written in code in that letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your theory of the killing of Giuseppe\u201d asked Anthony.",
    "\u201cI should say he was a regular thief and that he was got hold of\neither by King Victor or by the Comrades of the Red Hand and employed\nby them.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t wonder at all if the Comrades and King Victor\naren\u2019t working together.",
    "The organization has plenty of money and\npower but it isn\u2019t very strong in brains.",
    "Giuseppe\u2019s task was to steal\nthe Memoirs\u2014they couldn\u2019t have known that you had the letters\u2014it\u2019s a\nvery odd coincidence that you should have by the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you come to think of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiuseppe gets hold of the letters instead.",
    "Is at first vastly\nchagrined.",
    "Then sees the cutting from the paper and has the brilliant\nidea of turning them to account on his own by blackmailing the lady.",
    "He\nhas of course no idea of their real significance.",
    "The Comrades find\nout what he is doing believe that he is deliberately double crossing\nthem and decree his death.",
    "They\u2019re very fond of executing traitors.",
    "It has a picturesque element which seems to appeal to them.",
    "What I\ncan\u2019t quite make out is the revolver with \u2018Virginia\u2019 engraved upon it.",
    "There\u2019s too much finesse about that for the Comrades.",
    "As a rule they\nenjoy plastering their Red Hand sign about\u2014in order to strike terror\ninto other wouldbe traitors.",
    "No it looks to me as though King Victor\nhad stepped in there.",
    "But what his motive was I don\u2019t know.",
    "It looks\nlike a very deliberate attempt to saddle Mrs. Revel with the murder\nand on the surface there doesn\u2019t seem any particular point in that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a theory\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cBut it didn\u2019t work out according to\nplan.\u201d\n\nHe told Battle of Virginia\u2019s recognition of Michael.",
    "Battle nodded his\nhead.",
    "\u201cOh yes no doubt as to his identity.",
    "By the way that old Baron has a\nvery high opinion of you.",
    "He speaks of you in most enthusiastic terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of him\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cEspecially as I\u2019ve given him\nfull warning that I mean to do my utmost to get hold of the missing\nMemoirs before Wednesday next.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have a job to do that\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cY\u2014es.",
    "You think so I suppose King Victor and Co. have got the\nletters.\u201d\n\nBattle nodded.",
    "\u201cPinched them off Giuseppe that day in Pont Street.",
    "Prettily planned\npiece of work that.",
    "Yes they\u2019ve got \u2019em all right and they\u2019ve\ndecoded them and they know where to look.\u201d\n\nBoth men were on the point of passing out of the room.",
    "\u201cIn here\u201d said Anthony jerking his head back.",
    "\u201cExactly in here.",
    "But they haven\u2019t found the prize yet and they\u2019re\ngoing to run a pretty risk trying to get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose\u201d said Anthony \u201cthat you\u2019ve got a plan in that subtle head\nof yours\u201d\n\nBattle returned no answer.",
    "He looked particularly stolid and\nunintelligent.",
    "Then very slowly he winked.",
    "\u201cWant my help\u201d asked Anthony.",
    "\u201cI do.",
    "And I shall want some one else\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is that\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Revel\u2019s.",
    "You may not have noticed it Mr. Cade but she\u2019s a lady\nwho has a particularly beguiling way with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed it all right\u201d said Anthony.",
    "He glanced at his watch.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree with you about bed Battle.",
    "A dip in the lake\nand a hearty breakfast will be far more to the point.\u201d\n\nHe ran lightly upstairs to his bedroom.",
    "Whistling to himself he\ndiscarded his evening clothes and picked up a dressinggown and a bath\ntowel.",
    "Then suddenly he stopped dead in front of the dressingtable staring\nat the object that reposed demurely in front of the lookingglass.",
    "For a moment he could not believe his eyes.",
    "He took it up examined it\nclosely.",
    "Yes there was no mistake.",
    "It was the bundle of letters signed Virginia Revel.",
    "They were intact.",
    "Not one was missing.",
    "Anthony dropped into a chair the letters in his hand.",
    "\u201cMy brain must be cracking\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t understand a quarter\nof what is going on in this house.",
    "Why should the letters reappear like\na damned conjuring trick Who put them on my dressingtable Why\u201d\n\nAnd to all these very pertinent questions he could find no satisfactory\nreply.",
    "21\n\nMr. Isaacstein\u2019s Suitcase\n\n\nAt ten o\u2019clock that morning Lord Caterham and his daughter were\nbreakfasting.",
    "Bundle was looking very thoughtful.",
    "\u201cFather\u201d she said at last.",
    "Lord Caterham absorbed in The Times did not reply.",
    "\u201cFather\u201d said Bundle again more sharply.",
    "Lord Caterham torn from his interested perusal of forthcoming sales of\nrare books looked up absentmindedly.",
    "\u201cEh\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDid you speak\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Who is it who\u2019s had breakfast\u201d\n\nShe nodded towards a place that had evidently been occupied.",
    "The rest\nwere all expectant.",
    "\u201cOh what\u2019shisname.\u201d\n\n\u201cFat Iky\u201d\n\nBundle and her father had enough sympathy between them to comprehend\neach other\u2019s somewhat misleading observations.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I see you talking to the detective this morning before breakfast\u201d\n\nLord Caterham sighed.",
    "\u201cYes he buttonholed me in the hall.",
    "I do think the hours before\nbreakfast should be sacred.",
    "I shall have to go abroad.",
    "The strain on my\nnerves\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nBundle interrupted unceremoniously.",

    "That\u2019s what you\u2019ve been\nwanting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.",
    "But he didn\u2019t leave it at that.",
    "He went on to say that\nnevertheless he wanted me to ask every one to stay on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d said Bundle wrinkling her nose.",
    "\u201cSo confusing and contradictory\u201d complained Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cAnd before\nbreakfast too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I agreed of course.",
    "It\u2019s never any good arguing with these\npeople.",
    "Especially before breakfast\u201d continued Lord Caterham\nreverting to his principal grievance.",
    "\u201cWho have you asked so far\u201d\n\n\u201cCade.",
    "He was up very early this morning.",
    "He\u2019s going to stop on.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t mind that.",
    "I can\u2019t quite make the fellow out but I like him\u2014I\nlike him very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo does Virginia\u201d said Bundle drawing a pattern on the table with\nher fork.",
    "\u201cEh\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so do I.",
    "But that doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I asked Isaacstein\u201d continued Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d\n\n\u201cBut fortunately he\u2019s got to go back to town.",
    "Don\u2019t forget to order the\ncar for the 10.40 by the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow if I can only get rid of Fish too\u201d continued Lord Caterham his\nspirits rising.",
    "\u201cI thought you liked talking to him about your mouldy old books.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I do so I do.",
    "So I did rather.",
    "But it gets monotonous when\none finds that one is always doing all the talking.",
    "Fish is very\ninterested but he never volunteers any statements of his own.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than doing all the listening\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cLike one does\nwith George Lomax.\u201d\n\nLord Caterham shuddered at the remembrance.",
    "\u201cGeorge is all very well on platforms\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve clapped\nhim myself though of course I know all the time that he\u2019s talking\nbalderdash.",
    "And anyway I\u2019m a Socialist\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know my dear I know\u201d said Lord Caterham hastily.",

    "\u201cIs she to be asked to stop on\u201d\n\n\u201cBattle said everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cSays he firmly Have you asked her to be my stepma yet\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be any good\u201d said Lord Caterham mournfully.",

    "Take the first as paces.\u201d\n\nHe paced seven steps carefully and bending down examined the ground.",
    "\u201cAbout right I should fancy.",
    "At one time or another there\u2019s been\na chalk mark made here.",
    "Now then eight left.",
    "That\u2019s not paces the\npassage is only wide enough to go Indian file anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it in bricks\u201d suggested Anthony.",
    "\u201cQuite right Mr. Cade.",
    "Eight bricks from the bottom or the top on the\nlefthand side.",
    "Try from the bottom first\u2014it\u2019s easier.\u201d\n\nHe counted up eight bricks.",

    "What is\nit\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Battle was working at the brick with the point of his\nknife.",
    "His practised eye had quickly seen that this particular brick\nwas different from the rest.",
    "A minute or two\u2019s work and he was able to\npull it right out.",
    "Behind was a small dark cavity.",
    "Battle thrust in his\nhand.",
    "Every one waited in breathless expectancy.",
    "Battle drew out his hand again.",
    "He uttered an exclamation of surprise and anger.",

    "\u201cMean\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing it can mean.",
    "The late\nCount Stylptitch must have had a sense of humour This is an example\nof that humour.",
    "I may say that I don\u2019t consider it particularly funny\nmyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mind explaining your meaning a little more clearly sir\u201d said\nSuperintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cCertainly.",
    "This was the Count\u2019s little joke.",
    "He must have suspected\nthat his memorandum had been read.",

    "It\u2019s\nthe sort of thing you pin on to yourself at Book Teas when people have\nto guess what you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has a meaning then\u201d\n\n\u201cI should say undoubtedly.",
    "If the Count had meant to be merely\noffensive he would have put a placard with \u2018Sold\u2019 on it or a picture\nof a donkey or something crude like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit of knitting some capital E\u2019s and a lot of buttons\u201d muttered\nBattle discontentedly.",

    "It was of pink wood with a\nyellow head.",
    "\u201cAny of you ladies or gentlemen drop this by any chance\u201d he asked.",
    "He received a negative all round.",
    "\u201cWell then\u201d said Superintendent Battle \u201cwe\u2019ve seen all there is to\nsee.",
    "We might as well get out of here.\u201d\n\nThe proposal was assented to by all.",

    "The other listened with\nclose attention.",
    "\u201cNo I did not drop it.",
    "You say he found it in that clump of trees\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I assumed so but he did not actually say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is just possible that it might have fluttered out of M.\nIsaacstein\u2019s suitcase.",
    "Question Boris again.\u201d He handed the paper back\nto Anthony.",
    "After a minute or two he said \u201cWhat exactly do you know of\nthis man Boris\u201d\n\nAnthony shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cI understood he was the late Prince Michael\u2019s trusted servant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be so but make it your business to find out.",
    "Ask some one who\nknows such as the Baron Lolopretjzyl.",
    "Perhaps this man was engaged but\na few weeks ago.",
    "For myself I have believed him honest.",
    "But who knows\nKing Victor is quite capable of making himself into a trusted servant\nat a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really think\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nLemoine interrupted him.",
    "\u201cI will be quite frank.",
    "With me King Victor is an obsession.",
    "I see him\neverywhere.",
    "At this moment even I ask myself\u2014this man who is talking\nto me this M.

    "Me I am in England for one purpose and one\npurpose only to capture King Victor and to capture him redhanded.",
    "Nothing else matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink you\u2019ll do it\u201d asked Anthony lighting a cigarette.",
    "\u201cHow should I know\u201d said Lemoine with sudden despondency.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said Anthony.",
    "They had regained the terrace.",

    "\u201cLet\u2019s go and cheer him up.\u201d\nHe paused a minute and said \u201cYou know you\u2019re an odd fish in some\nways M. Lemoine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what ways M. Cade\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Anthony \u201cin your place I should have been inclined\nto note down that address that I showed you.",
    "It may be of no\nimportance\u2014quite conceivably.",
    "On the other hand it might be very\nimportant indeed.\u201d\n\nLemoine looked at him for a minute or two steadily.",
    "Then with a slight\nsmile he drew back the cuff of his left coat sleeve.",
    "Pencilled on the\nwhite shirtcuff beneath were the words \u201cHurstmere Langly Road Dover.\u201d\n\n\u201cI apologize\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cAnd I retire worsted.\u201d\n\nHe joined Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cYou look very pensive Battle\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to think about Mr. Cade.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I expect you have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t dovetailing.",
    "They\u2019re not dovetailing at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery trying\u201d sympathized Anthony.",
    "\u201cNever mind Battle if the worst\ncomes to the worst you can always arrest me.",
    "You\u2019ve got my guilty\nfootprints to fall back upon remember.\u201d\n\nBut the superintendent did not smile.",
    "\u201cGot any enemies here that you know of Mr. Cade\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve an idea that the third footman doesn\u2019t like me\u201d replied\nAnthony lightly.",
    "\u201cHe does his best to forget to hand me the choicest\nvegetables.",
    "Why\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting anonymous letters\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cOr\nrather an anonymous letter I should say.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout me\u201d\n\nWithout answering Battle took a folded sheet of cheap notepaper from\nhis pocket and handed it to Anthony.",
    "Scrawled on it in an illiterate\nhandwriting were the words\n\n\u201cLook out for Mr. Cade.",
    "He isn\u2019t wot he seems.\u201d\n\nAnthony handed it back with a light laugh.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all Cheer up Battle.",
    "I\u2019m really a King in disguise you know.\u201d\n\nHe went into the house whistling lightly as he walked along.",
    "But as\nhe entered his bedroom and shut the door behind him his face changed.",
    "It grew set and stern.",
    "He sat down on the edge of the bed and stared\nmoodily at the floor.",
    "\u201cThings are getting serious\u201d said Anthony to himself.",
    "\u201cSomething must\nbe done about it.",
    "It\u2019s all damned awkward....\u201d\n\nHe sat there for a minute or two then strolled to the window.",
    "For a\nmoment or two he stood looking out aimlessly and then his eyes became\nsuddenly focused on a certain spot and his face lightened.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe Rose Garden That\u2019s it The Rose Garden.\u201d\n\nHe hurried downstairs again and out into the garden by a side door.",
    "He\napproached the Rose Garden by a circuitous route.",
    "It had a little gate\nat either end.",
    "He entered by the far one and walked up to the sundial\nwhich was on a raised hillock in the exact centre of the garden.",
    "Just as Anthony reached it he stopped dead and stared at another\noccupant of the Rose Garden who seemed equally surprised to see him.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you were interested in roses Mr. Fish\u201d said\nAnthony gently.",
    "\u201cSir\u201d said Mr.",
    "Fish \u201cI am considerably interested in roses.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other warily as antagonists seek to measure their\nopponents\u2019 strength.",
    "\u201cSo am I\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cIs that so\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact I dote upon roses\u201d said Anthony airily.",
    "A very slight smile hovered upon Mr. Fish\u2019s lips and at the same time\nAnthony also smiled.",
    "The tension seemed to relax.",
    "\u201cLook at this beauty now\u201d said Mr.",
    "Fish stooping to point out a\nparticularly fine bloom.",
    "\u201cMadame Abel Chatenay I pressoom it to be.",
    "Yes I am right.",
    "This white rose before the war was known as Frau\nCarl Drusky.",
    "They have I believe renamed it.",
    "Over sensitive perhaps\nbut truly patriotic.",
    "The La France is always popular.",
    "Do you care for\nred roses at all Mr. Cade A bright scarlet rose now\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Fish\u2019s slow drawling voice was interrupted.",

    "\u201cCare for a spin to town Mr.",
    "Fish I\u2019m just off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Lady Eileen but I am vurry happy here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure you won\u2019t change your mind Mr. Cade\u201d\n\nAnthony laughed and shook his head.",
    "Bundle disappeared.",
    "\u201cSleep is more in my line\u201d said Anthony with a wide yawn.",
    "\u201cA good\nafter luncheon nap\u201d He took out a cigarette.",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a match\nhave you\u201d\n\nMr.",
    "Fish handed him a matchbox.",
    "Anthony helped himself and handed\nback the box with a word of thanks.",
    "\u201cRoses\u201d said Anthony \u201care all very well.",
    "But I don\u2019t feel\nparticularly horticultural this afternoon.\u201d\n\nWith a disarming smile he nodded cheerfully.",
    "A thundering noise sounded from just outside the house.",
    "\u201cPretty powerful engine she\u2019s got in that car of hers\u201d remarked\nAnthony.",
    "\u201cThere off she goes.\u201d\n\nThey had a view of the car speeding down the long drive.",
    "Anthony yawned again and strolled towards the house.",
    "He passed in through the door.",
    "Once inside he seemed as though changed\nto quicksilver.",
    "He raced across the hall out through one of the\nwindows on the farther side and across the park.",
    "Bundle he knew had\nto make a big d\u00e9tour by the lodge gates and through the village.",
    "He ran desperately.",
    "It was a race against time.",
    "He reached the park\nwall just as he heard the car outside.",
    "He swung himself up and dropped\ninto the road.",
    "\u201cHi\u201d cried Anthony.",
    "In her astonishment Bundle swerved half across the road.",
    "She managed\nto pull up without accident.",
    "Anthony ran after the car opened the\ndoor and jumped in beside Bundle.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m coming to London with you\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI meant to all along.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtraordinary person\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got in your\nhand\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a match\u201d said Anthony.",
    "He regarded it thoughtfully.",
    "It was pink with a yellow head.",
    "He threw\naway his unlighted cigarette and put the match carefully into his\npocket.",
    "24\n\nThe House at Dover\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind I suppose\u201d said Bundle after a minute or two \u201cif I\ndrive rather fast I started later than I meant to do.\u201d\n\nIt had seemed to Anthony that they were proceeding at a terrific speed\nalready but he soon saw that that was nothing compared to what Bundle\ncould get out of the Panhard if she tried.",
    "\u201cSome people\u201d said Bundle as she slowed down momentarily to pass\nthrough a village \u201care terrified of my driving.",
    "Poor old father for\ninstance.",
    "Nothing would induce him to come up with me in this old bus.\u201d\n\nPrivately Anthony thought Lord Caterham was entirely justified.",
    "Driving with Bundle was not a sport to be indulged in by nervous\nmiddleaged gentlemen.",
    "\u201cBut you don\u2019t seem nervous a bit\u201d continued Bundle approvingly as\nshe swept round a corner on two wheels.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m in pretty good training you see\u201d explained Anthony gravely.",
    "\u201cAlso\u201d he added as an afterthought \u201cI\u2019m rather in a hurry myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I speed her up a bit more\u201d asked Bundle kindly.",
    "\u201cGood Lord no\u201d said Anthony hastily.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re averaging about fifty as\nit is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m burning with curiosity to know the reason of this sudden\ndeparture\u201d said Bundle after executing a fanfare upon the Klaxon\nwhich must temporarily have deafened the neighbourhood.",
    "\u201cBut I suppose\nI mustn\u2019t ask You\u2019re not escaping from justice are you\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI shall know soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Scotland Yard man isn\u2019t as much of a rabbit as I thought\u201d said\nBundle thoughtfully.",

    "\u201cYou ought to have been in diplomacy\u201d remarked Bundle.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t part\nwith much information do you\u201d\n\n\u201cI was under the impression that I babbled.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Boy You\u2019re not eloping with Mademoiselle Brun by any chance\u201d\n\n\u201cNot guilty\u201d said Anthony with fervour.",
    "There was a pause of some minutes during which Bundle caught up and\npassed three other cars.",
    "Then she asked suddenly\n\n\u201cHow long have you known Virginia\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a difficult question to answer\u201d said Anthony with perfect\ntruth.",
    "\u201cI haven\u2019t actually met her very often and yet I seem to have\nknown her a long time.\u201d\n\nBundle nodded.",
    "\u201cVirginia\u2019s got brains\u201d she remarked abruptly.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s always talking\nnonsense but she\u2019s got brains all right.",
    "She was frightfully good out\nin Herzoslovakia I believe.",
    "If Tim Revel had lived he\u2019d have had a\nfine career\u2014and mostly owing to Virginia.",
    "She worked for him tooth and\nnail.",
    "She did everything in the world she could for him\u2014and I know\nwhy too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she cared for him\u201d Anthony sat looking very straight ahead of\nhim.",
    "\u201cNo because she didn\u2019t.",
    "Don\u2019t you see She didn\u2019t love him\u2014she never\nloved him and so she did everything on earth she could to make up.",
    "That\u2019s Virginia all over.",
    "But don\u2019t you make any mistake about it.",
    "Virginia was never in love with Tim Revel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem very positive\u201d said Anthony turning to look at her.",
    "Bundle\u2019s little hands were clenched on the steering wheel and her\nchin was stuck out in a determined manner.",
    "\u201cI know a thing or two.",
    "I was only a kid at the time of her marriage\nbut I heard one or two things and knowing Virginia I can put them\ntogether easily enough.",
    "Tim Revel was bowled over by Virginia\u2014he was\nIrish you know and most attractive with a genius for expressing\nhimself well.",
    "Virginia was quite young\u2014eighteen.",
    "She couldn\u2019t go\nanywhere without seeing Tim in a state of picturesque misery vowing\nhe\u2019d shoot himself or take to drink if she didn\u2019t marry him.",
    "Girls\nbelieve these things\u2014or used to\u2014we\u2019ve advanced a lot in the last\neight years.",
    "Virginia was carried away by the feeling she thought she\u2019d\ninspired.",
    "She married him\u2014and she was an angel to him always.",
    "She\nwouldn\u2019t have been half as much of an angel if she\u2019d loved him.",
    "There\u2019s\na lot of the devil in Virginia.",
    "But I can tell you one thing\u2014she\nenjoys her freedom.",
    "And anyone will have a hard time persuading her to\ngive it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder why you tell me all this\u201d said Anthony slowly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to know about people isn\u2019t it Some people that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to know\u201d he acknowledged.",
    "\u201cAnd you\u2019d never have heard from Virginia.",
    "But you can trust me for an\ninside tip from the stables.",
    "Virginia\u2019s a darling.",
    "Even women like her\nbecause she isn\u2019t a bit of a cat.",
    "And anyway\u201d Bundle ended somewhat\nobscurely \u201cone must be a sport mustn\u2019t one\u201d\n\n\u201cOh certainly\u201d Anthony agreed.",
    "But he was still puzzled.",
    "He had no\nidea what had prompted Bundle to give him so much information unasked.",
    "That he was glad of it he did not deny.",
    "\u201cHere are the trams\u201d said Bundle with a sigh.",
    "\u201cNow I suppose I\nshall have to drive carefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be as well\u201d agreed Anthony.",
    "His ideas and Bundle\u2019s on the subject of careful driving hardly\ncoincided.",
    "Leaving indignant suburbs behind them they finally emerged\ninto Oxford Street.",
    "\u201cNot bad going eh\u201d said Bundle glancing at her wrist watch.",
    "Anthony assented fervently.",
    "\u201cWhere do you want to be dropped\u201d\n\n\u201cAnywhere.",
    "Which way are you going\u201d\n\n\u201cKnightsbridge way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right drop me at Hyde Park Corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodbye\u201d said Bundle as she drew up at the place indicated.",
    "\u201cWhat\nabout the return journey\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll find my own way back thanks very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have scared him\u201d remarked Bundle.",
    "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t recommend driving with you as a tonic for nervous old\nladies but personally I\u2019ve enjoyed it.",
    "The last time I was in equal\ndanger was when I was charged by a herd of wild elephants.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re extremely rude\u201d remarked Bundle.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve not even had\none bump today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you\u2019ve been holding yourself in on my account\u201d retorted\nAnthony.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think men are really very brave\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a nasty one\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI retire humiliated.\u201d Bundle\nnodded and drove on.",
    "Anthony hailed a passing taxi.",
    "\u201cVictoria Station\u201d\nhe said to the driver as he got in.",
    "When he got to Victoria he paid off the taxi and inquired for the next\ntrain to Dover.",
    "Unfortunately he had just missed one.",
    "Resigning himself to a wait of something over an hour Anthony paced up\nand down his brows knit.",
    "Once or twice he shook his head impatiently.",
    "The journey to Dover was uneventful.",
    "Arrived there Anthony passed\nquickly out of the station and then as though suddenly remembering\nhe turned back again.",
    "There was a slight smile on his lips as he asked\nto be directed to Hurstmere Langly Road.",
    "The road in question was a long one leading right out of the town.",
    "According to the porter\u2019s instructions Hurstmere was the last house.",
    "Anthony trudged along steadily.",
    "The little pucker had reappeared\nbetween his eyes.",
    "Nevertheless there was a new elation in his manner\nas always when danger was near at hand.",
    "Hurstmere was as the porter had said the last house in Langly Road.",
    "It stood well back enclosed in its own grounds which were ragged and\novergrown.",
    "The place Anthony judged must have been empty for many\nyears.",
    "A large iron gate swung rustily on its hinges and the name on\nthe gatepost was half obliterated.",
    "\u201cA lonely spot\u201d muttered Anthony to himself \u201cand a good one to\nchoose.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated a minute or two glanced quickly up and down the\nroad\u2014which was quite deserted\u2014and then slipped quietly past the\ncreaking gate into the overgrown drive.",
    "He walked up it a little\nway and then stood listening.",
    "He was still some distance from the\nhouse.",
    "Not a sound could be heard anywhere.",
    "Some fast yellowing leaves\ndetached themselves from one of the trees overhead and fell with a\nsoft rustling sound that was almost sinister in the stillness.",
    "Anthony\nstarted then smiled.",
    "\u201cNerves\u201d he murmured to himself.",
    "\u201cNever knew I had such things before.\u201d\n\nHe went on up the drive.",
    "Presently as the drive curved he slipped\ninto the shrubbery and so continued his way unseen from the house.",
    "Suddenly he stood still peering out through the leaves.",
    "Some distance\naway a dog was barking but it was a sound nearer at hand that had\nattracted Anthony\u2019s attention.",
    "His keen hearing had not been mistaken.",
    "A man came rapidly round\nthe corner of the house a short square thickset man foreign in\nappearance.",
    "He did not pause but walked steadily on circling the house\nand disappearing again.",
    "Anthony nodded to himself.",
    "\u201cSentry\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cThey do the thing quite well.\u201d\n\nAs soon as he had passed Anthony went on diverging to the left and\nso following in the footsteps of the sentry.",
    "His own footsteps were quite noiseless.",
    "The wall of the house was on his right and presently he came to where\na broad blur of light fell on the gravelled walk.",
    "The sound of several\nmen talking together was clearly audible.",
    "\u201cMy God what doubledyed idiots\u201d murmured Anthony to himself.",
    "\u201cIt\nwould serve them right to be given a fright.\u201d\n\nHe stole up to the window stooping a little so that he should not be\nseen.",
    "Presently he lifted his head very carefully to the level of the\nsill and looked in.",
    "Half a dozen men were sprawling round a table.",
    "Four of them were big\nthickset men with high cheekbones and eyes set in Magyar slanting\nfashion.",
    "The other two were ratlike little men with quick gestures.",
    "The language that was being spoken was French but the four big men\nspoke it with uncertainty and a hoarse guttural intonation.",
    "\u201cThe Boss\u201d growled one of these.",
    "\u201cWhen will he be here\u201d\n\nOne of the smaller men shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cAny time now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout time too\u201d growled the first man.",
    "\u201cI have never seen him this\nBoss of yours but oh what great and glorious work might we not have\naccomplished in these days of idle waiting\u201d\n\n\u201cFool\u201d said the other little man bitingly.",
    "\u201cGetting nabbed by the\npolice is all the great and glorious work you and your precious lot\nwould have been likely to accomplish.",
    "A lot of blundering gorillas\u201d\n\n\u201cAha\u201d roared another big thickset fellow.",
    "\u201cYou insult the Comrades I\nwill soon set the sign of the Red Hand round your throat.\u201d\n\nHe half rose glaring ferociously at the Frenchman but one of his\ncompanions pulled him back again.",
    "\u201cNo quarreling\u201d he grunted.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re to work together.",
    "From all I heard\nthis King Victor doesn\u2019t stand for being disobeyed.\u201d\n\nIn the darkness Anthony heard the footsteps of the sentry coming his\nround again and he drew back behind a bush.",
    "\u201cWho\u2019s that\u201d said one of the men inside.",
    "\u201cCarlo\u2014going his rounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh What about the prisoner\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s all right\u2014coming round pretty fast now.",
    "He\u2019s recovered well from\nthe crack on the head we gave him.\u201d\n\nAnthony moved gently away.",
    "\u201cGod what a lot\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cThey discuss their affairs with an\nopen window and that fool Carlo goes his round with the tread of an\nelephant and the eyes of a bat.",
    "And to crown all the Herzoslovakians\nand the French are on the point of coming to blows.",
    "King Victor\u2019s\nheadquarters seem to be in a parlous condition.",
    "It would amuse me it\nwould amuse me very much to teach them a lesson.\u201d\n\nHe stood irresolute for a minute smiling to himself.",
    "From somewhere above his head came a stifled groan.",
    "Anthony looked up.",
    "The groan came again.",
    "Anthony glanced quickly from left to right.",
    "Carlo was not due round\nagain just yet.",
    "He grasped the heavy Virginia creeper and climbed\nnimbly till he reached the sill of a window.",
    "The window was shut but\nwith a tool from his pocket he soon succeeded in forcing up the catch.",
    "He paused a minute to listen then sprang lightly inside the room.",
    "There was a bed in the far corner and on that bed a man was lying his\nfigure barely discernible in the gloom.",
    "Anthony went over to the bed and flashed his pocket torch on the man\u2019s\nface.",
    "It was a foreign face pale and emaciated and the head was\nswathed in heavy bandages.",
    "The man was bound hand and foot.",
    "He stared up at Anthony like one dazed.",
    "Anthony bent over him and as he did so he heard a sound behind him and\nswung round his hand travelling to his coat pocket.",
    "But a sharp command arrested him.",
    "\u201cHands up sonny.",
    "You didn\u2019t expect to see me here but I happened to\ncatch the same train as you at Victoria.\u201d\n\nIt was Mr. Hiram Fish who was standing in the doorway.",
    "He was smiling\nand in his hand was a big blue automatic.",
    "25\n\nTuesday Night at Chimneys\n\n\nLord Caterham Virginia and Bundle were sitting in the library after\ndinner.",
    "It was Tuesday evening.",
    "Some thirty hours had elapsed since\nAnthony\u2019s rather dramatic departure.",
    "For at least the seventh time Bundle repeated Anthony\u2019s parting words\nas spoken at Hyde Park Corner.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll find my own way back\u201d repeated Virginia thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThat\ndoesn\u2019t look as though he expected to be away as long as this.",
    "And he\u2019s\nleft all his things here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you where he was going\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Virginia looking straight in front of her.",
    "\u201cHe told me\nnothing.\u201d\n\nAfter this there was a silence for a minute or two.",
    "Lord Caterham was\nthe first to break it.",
    "\u201cOn the whole\u201d he said \u201ckeeping an hotel has some advantages over\nkeeping a country house.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat little notice they always hang up in your room.",
    "Visitors\nintending departure must give notice before twelve o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nVirginia smiled.",
    "\u201cI dare say\u201d he continued \u201cthat I am oldfashioned and unreasonable.",
    "It\u2019s the fashion I know to pop in and out of a house.",
    "Same idea as an\nhotel\u2014perfect freedom of action and no bill at the end\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are an old grouser\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve had Virginia and me.",
    "What more do you want\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing more nothing more\u201d Lord Caterham assured them hastily.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all.",
    "It\u2019s the principle of the thing.",
    "It gives one\nsuch a restless feeling.",
    "I\u2019m quite willing to admit that it\u2019s been an\nalmost ideal twentyfour hours.",
    "Peace\u2014perfect peace.",
    "No burglaries or\nother crimes of violence no detectives no Americans.",
    "What I complain\nof is that I should have enjoyed it all so much more if I\u2019d felt really\nsecure.",
    "As it is all the time I\u2019ve been saying to myself \u2018One or other\nof them is bound to turn up in a minute.\u2019 And that spoilt the whole\nthing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell nobody has turned up\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve been left severely\nalone\u2014neglected in fact.",
    "It\u2019s odd the way Fish disappeared.",
    "Didn\u2019t he\nsay anything\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a word.",
    "Last time I saw him he was pacing up and down the Rose\nGarden yesterday afternoon smoking one of those unpleasant cigars of\nhis.",
    "After that he seems to have just melted into the landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody must have kidnapped him\u201d said Bundle hopefully.",
    "\u201cIn another day or two I expect we shall have Scotland Yard dragging\nthe lake to find his dead body\u201d said her father gloomily.",
    "\u201cIt serves\nme right.",
    "At my time of life I ought to have gone quietly abroad and\ntaken care of my health and not allowed myself to be drawn into George\nLomax\u2019s wildcat schemes.",
    "I\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nHe was interrupted by Tredwell.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Lord Caterham irritably \u201cwhat is it\u201d\n\n\u201cThe French detective is here my lord and would be glad if you could\nspare him a few minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did I tell you\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cI knew it was too good to\nlast.",
    "Depend upon it they\u2019ve found Fish\u2019s dead body doubled up in the\ngoldfish pond.\u201d\n\nTredwell in a strictly respectful manner steered him back to the\npoint of issue.",
    "\u201cAm I to say that you will see him my lord\u201d\n\n\u201cYes yes.",
    "Bring him in here.\u201d\n\nTredwell departed.",
    "He returned a minute or two later announcing in a\nlugubrious voice\n\n\u201cMonsieur Lemoine.\u201d\n\nThe Frenchman came in with a quick light step.",
    "His walk more than his\nface betrayed the fact that he was excited about something.",
    "\u201cGood evening Lemoine\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cHave a drink won\u2019t you\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you no.\u201d He bowed punctiliously to the ladies.",
    "\u201cAt last I\nmake progress.",
    "As things are I felt that you should be acquainted with\nthe discoveries\u2014the very grave discoveries that I have made in the\ncourse of the last twentyfour hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought there must be something important going on somewhere\u201d said\nLord Caterham.",
    "\u201cMy lord yesterday afternoon one of your guests left this house in\na curious manner.",
    "From the beginning I must tell you I have had my\nsuspicions.",
    "Here is a man who comes from the wilds.",
    "Two months ago he\nwas in South Africa.",
    "Before that\u2014where\u201d\n\nVirginia drew a sharp breath.",
    "For a moment the Frenchman\u2019s eyes rested\non her doubtfully.",
    "Then he went on\n\n\u201cBefore that\u2014where None can say.",
    "And he is just such a one as\nthe man I am looking for\u2014gay audacious reckless one who would\ndare anything.",
    "I send cable after cable but I can get no word as\nto his past life.",
    "Ten years ago he was in Canada yes but since\nthen\u2014silence.",
    "My suspicions grow stronger.",
    "Then I picked up one\nday a scrap of paper where he has lately passed along.",
    "It bears an\naddress\u2014the address of a house in Dover.",
    "Later as though by chance\nI drop that same piece of paper.",
    "Out of the tail of my eye I see this\nBoris this Herzoslovakian pick it up and take it to his master.",
    "All along I have been sure that this Boris is an emissary of the\nComrades of the Red Hand.",
    "We know that the Comrades are working in with\nKing Victor over this affair.",
    "If Boris recognized his Chief in Mr.\nAnthony Cade would he not do just what he has done\u2014transferred his\nallegiance Why should he attach himself otherwise to an insignificant\nstranger It was suspicious I tell you very suspicious.",
    "\u201cBut almost I am disarmed for Anthony Cade brings this same paper to\nme at once and asks me if I have dropped it.",
    "As I say almost I am\ndisarmed\u2014but not quite For it may mean that he is innocent or it may\nmean that he is very very clever.",
    "I deny of course that it is mine\nor that I dropped it.",
    "But in the meantime I have set inquiries on foot.",
    "Only today I have news.",
    "The house at Dover has been precipitately\nabandoned but up till yesterday afternoon it was occupied by a body\nof foreigners.",
    "Not a doubt but that it was King Victor\u2019s headquarters.",
    "Now see the significance of these points.",
    "Yesterday afternoon Mr. Cade\nclears out from here precipitately.",
    "Ever since he dropped that paper\nhe must know that the game is up.",
    "He reaches Dover and immediately the\ngang is disbanded.",
    "What the next move will be I do not know.",
    "What\nis quite certain is that Mr. Anthony Cade will not return here.",
    "But\nknowing King Victor as I do I am certain that he will not abandon\nthe game without having one more try for the jewel.",
    "And that is when I\nshall get him\u201d\n\nVirginia stood up suddenly.",
    "She walked across to the mantelpiece and\nspoke in a voice that rang cold like steel.",
    "\u201cYou are leaving one thing out of account I think M. Lemoine\u201d she\nsaid.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Cade is not the only guest who disappeared yesterday in a\nsuspicious manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean Madame\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat all you have said applies equally well to another person.",
    "What\nabout Mr. Hiram Fish\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Mr. Fish\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Mr.",
    "Fish.",
    "Did you not tell us that first night that King\nVictor had lately come to England from America So has Mr.",
    "Fish come\nto England from America.",
    "It is true that he brought a letter of\nintroduction from a very wellknown man but surely that would be a\nsimple thing for a man like King Victor to manage.",
    "He is certainly not\nwhat he pretends to be.",
    "Lord Caterham has commented on the fact that\nwhen it is a question of the first editions he is supposed to have\ncome here to see he is always the listener never the talker.",
    "And there\nare several suspicious facts against him.",
    "There was a light in his\nwindow the night of the murder.",
    "Then take that evening in the Council\nChamber.",
    "When I met him on the terrace he was fully dressed.",
    "He could\nhave dropped the paper.",
    "You didn\u2019t actually see Mr. Cade do so.",
    "Mr.\nCade may have gone to Dover.",
    "If he did it was simply to investigate.",
    "He\nmay have been kidnapped there.",
    "I say that there is far more suspicion\nattaching to Mr. Fish\u2019s actions than to Mr. Cade\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe Frenchman\u2019s voice rang out sharply\n\n\u201cFrom your point of view that well may be Madame.",
    "I do not dispute\nit.",
    "And I agree that Mr.",
    "Fish is not what he seems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that makes no difference.",
    "You see Madame Mr.",
    "Fish is a\nPinkerton\u2019s man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d cried Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cYes Lord Caterham.",
    "He came over here to trail King Victor.",
    "Superintendent Battle and I have known this for some time.\u201d\n\nVirginia said nothing.",
    "Very slowly she sat down again.",
    "With those few\nwords the structure that she had built up so carefully was scattered in\nruins about her feet.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d Lemoine was continuing \u201cwe have all known that eventually\nKing Victor would come to Chimneys.",
    "It was the one place we were sure\nof catching him.\u201d\n\nVirginia looked up with an odd light in her eyes and suddenly she\nlaughed.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve not caught him yet\u201d she said.",
    "Lemoine looked at her curiously.",
    "\u201cNo Madame.",
    "But I shall.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be rather famous for outwitting people isn\u2019t he\u201d\n\nThe Frenchman\u2019s face darkened with anger.",
    "\u201cThis time it will be different\u201d he said between his teeth.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s a very attractive fellow\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cVery attractive.",
    "But surely\u2014why you said he was an old friend of yours Virginia\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why\u201d said Virginia composedly \u201cI think M. Lemoine must be\nmaking a mistake.\u201d\n\nAnd her eyes met the detective\u2019s steadily but he appeared in no wise\ndiscomfited.",
    "\u201cTime will show Madame\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDo you pretend that it was he who shot Prince Michael\u201d she asked\npresently.",
    "\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\nBut Virginia shook her head.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cOh no That is one thing I am quite sure of.",
    "Anthony Cade never killed Prince Michael.\u201d\n\nLemoine was watching her intently.",
    "\u201cThere is a possibility that you are right Madame\u201d he said slowly.",
    "\u201cA\npossibility that is all.",
    "It may have been the Herzoslovakian Boris\nwho exceeded his orders and fired that shot.",
    "Who knows Prince Michael\nmay have done him some great wrong and the man sought revenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks a murderous sort of fellow\u201d agreed Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cThe\nhousemaids I believe scream when he passes them in the passages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Lemoine.",
    "\u201cI must be going now.",
    "I felt it was due to you\nmy lord to know exactly how things stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery kind of you I\u2019m sure\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cQuite certain you\nwon\u2019t have a drink All right then.",
    "Good night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate that man with his prim little black beard and his eyeglasses\u201d\nsaid Bundle as soon as the door had shut behind him.",
    "\u201cI hope Anthony\ndoes snoo him.",
    "I\u2019d love to see him dancing with rage.",
    "What do you\nthink about it all Virginia\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Virginia.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m tired.",
    "I shall go up to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bad idea\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s halfpast eleven.\u201d\n\nAs Virginia was crossing the wide hall she caught sight of a broad\nback that seemed familiar to her discreetly vanishing through a side\ndoor.",
    "\u201cSuperintendent Battle\u201d she called imperiously.",
    "The superintendent for it was indeed he retraced his steps with a\nshade of unwillingness.",
    "\u201cYes Mrs. Revel\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Lemoine has been here.",
    "He says\u2014\u2014 Tell me is it true really\ntrue that Mr.",
    "Fish is an American detective\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Battle nodded.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have known it all along\u201d\n\nAgain Superintendent Battle nodded.",
    "Virginia turned away towards the staircase.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nUntil that minute she had refused to believe.",
    "And now\u2014\u2014\n\nSitting down before her dressingtable in her own room she faced the\nquestion squarely.",
    "Every word that Anthony had said came back to her\nfraught with a new significance.",
    "Was this the \u201ctrade\u201d that he had spoken of\n\nThe trade that he had given up.",
    "But then\u2014\u2014\n\nAn unusual sound disturbed the even tenor of her meditations.",
    "She\nlifted her head with a start.",
    "Her little gold clock showed the hour to\nbe after one.",
    "Nearly two hours she had sat here thinking.",
    "Again the sound was repeated.",
    "A sharp tap on the windowpane.",
    "Virginia\nwent to the window and opened it.",
    "Below on the pathway was a tall\nfigure which even as she looked stooped for another handful of gravel.",

    "At this juncture it is\u2014unwise to permit any one\nperson to leave the room.",
    "Especially if that person has rather\nquestionable antecedents.\u201d\n\nAnthony raised his eyebrows and lighted a cigarette.",
    "\u201cI suppose a vagabond life is not very respectable\u201d he mused.",
    "\u201cTwo months ago Mr. Cade you were in South Africa.",
    "That is admitted.",
    "Where were you before that\u201d\n\nAnthony leaned back in his chair idly blowing smoke rings.",

    "Wild North West.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you were not in prison A French prison\u201d\n\nAutomatically Superintendent Battle moved a step nearer the door as\nif to cut off a retreat that way but Anthony showed no signs of doing\nanything dramatic.",
    "Instead he stared at the French detective and then burst out laughing.",
    "\u201cMy poor Lemoine.",
    "It is a monomania with you You do indeed see King\nVictor everywhere.",
    "So you fancy that I am that interesting gentleman\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you deny it\u201d\n\nAnthony brushed a fleck of ash from his coat sleeve.",
    "\u201cI never deny anything that amuses me\u201d he said lightly.",
    "\u201cBut the\naccusation is really too ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh you think so\u201d The Frenchman leant forward.",
    "His face was twitching\npainfully and yet he seemed perplexed and baffled\u2014as though something\nin Anthony\u2019s manner puzzled him.",
    "\u201cWhat if I tell you Monsieur that\nthis time\u2014this time\u2014I am out to get King Victor and nothing shall\nstop me\u201d\n\n\u201cVery laudable\u201d was Anthony\u2019s comment.",

    "Aren\u2019t you afraid that that may happen again He\u2019s a slippery fellow\nby all accounts.\u201d\n\nThe conversation had developed into a duel between the detective and\nAnthony.",
    "Every one else in the room was conscious of the tension.",
    "It\nwas a fight to a finish between the Frenchman painfully in earnest\nand the man who smoked so calmly and whose words seemed to show that he\nhad not a care in the world.",
    "\u201cIf I were you Lemoine\u201d continued Anthony \u201cI should be very very\ncareful.",
    "Watch your step and all that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time\u201d said Lemoine grimly \u201cthere will be no mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem very sure about it all\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cBut there\u2019s such a\nthing as evidence you know.\u201d\n\nLemoine smiled and something in his smile seemed to attract Anthony\u2019s\nattention.",
    "He sat up and stubbed out his cigarette.",
    "\u201cYou saw that note I wrote just now\u201d said the French detective.",
    "\u201cIt\nwas to my people at the inn.",

    "I have asked for them to be sent up to me\nhere.",
    "In a few minutes we shall know whether you are the man\u201d\n\nAnthony stared steadily at him.",
    "Then a little smile crept over his face.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re really rather clever Lemoine.",
    "I never thought of that.",
    "The\ndocuments will arrive you will induce me to dip my fingers in the ink\nor something equally unpleasant you will measure my ears and look for\nmy distinguishing marks.",
    "And if they agree\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Lemoine \u201cif they agree\u2014eh\u201d\n\nAnthony leaned forward in his chair.",

    "\u201cBut\u2014I shall have\nproved then that you are King Victor\u201d\n\nBut for the first time a shade of uncertainty crept into his manner.",
    "\u201cThat will doubtless be a great satisfaction to you\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t quite see where it\u2019s going to hurt me.",
    "I\u2019m not admitting\nanything but supposing just for the sake of argument that I was King\nVictor\u2014I might be trying to repent you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepent\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea.",

    "And I can prove that easily enough.",
    "If King Victor impersonated\nPrince Nicholas in America then I\u2019m not King Victor.",
    "You\u2019re sure he\nwas impersonated That it wasn\u2019t the man himself\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Battle suddenly interposed.",

    "You are too clever to say\nit if it were not true.",
    "But there is something else.",

    "The murder of Prince Michael.",
    "He interfered with you that night\nas you were looking for the jewel.\u201d\n\n\u201cLemoine have you ever known King Victor to do murder\u201d Anthony\u2019s\nvoice rang out sharply.",
    "\u201cYou know as well\u2014better than I do that he\nhas never shed blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho else but you could have murdered him\u201d cried Lemoine.",
    "\u201cTell me\nthat\u201d\n\nThe last word died on his lips as a shrill whistle sounded from the\nterrace outside.",
    "Anthony sprang up all his assumed nonchalance laid\naside.",

    "\u201cI won\u2019t tell\nyou\u2014I\u2019ll show you.",
    "That whistle was the signal I\u2019ve been waiting\nfor.",
    "The murderer of Prince Michael is in the library now.\u201d\n\nHe sprang out through the window and the others followed him as he led\nthe way round the terrace until they came to the library window.",
    "He\npushed the window and it yielded to his touch.",
    "Very softly he held aside the thick velvet curtain so that they could\nlook into the room.",
    "Standing by the bookcase was a dark figure hurriedly pulling out and\nreplacing volumes so absorbed in the task that no outside sound was\nheeded.",
    "And then as they stood watching trying to recognize the figure that\nwas vaguely silhouetted against the light of the electric torch it\ncarried some one sprang past them with a sound like the roar of a wild\nbeast.",
    "The torch fell to the ground was extinguished and the sounds of a\nterrific struggle filled the room.",
    "Lord Caterham groped his way to the\nlights and switched them on.",
    "Two figures were swaying together.",
    "And as they looked the end came.",
    "The\nshort sharp crack of a pistol shot and the smaller figure crumpled up\nand fell.",
    "The other figure turned and faced them\u2014it was Boris his\neyes alight with rage.",
    "\u201cShe killed my Master\u201d he growled.",
    "\u201cNow she tries to shoot me.",
    "I would\nhave taken the pistol from her and shot her but it went off in the\nstruggle.",
    "St. Michael directed it.",
    "The evil woman is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman\u201d cried George Lomax.",
    "They drew nearer.",
    "On the floor the pistol still clasped in her hand\nand an expression of deadly malignity on her face lay\u2014Mademoiselle\nBrun.",
    "28\n\nKing Victor\n\n\n\u201cI suspected her from the first\u201d explained Anthony.",
    "\u201cThere was a\nlight in her room on the night of the murder.",
    "Afterwards I wavered.",
    "I made inquiries about her in Brittany and came back satisfied that\nshe was what she represented herself to be.",
    "I was a fool.",
    "Because the\nComtesse de Breteuil had employed a Mademoiselle Brun and spoke highly\nof her it never occurred to me that the real Mademoiselle Brun might\nhave been kidnapped on her way to her new post and that it might be\na substitute taking her place.",
    "Instead I shifted my suspicions to Mr.",
    "Fish.",
    "It was not until he had followed me to Dover and we had had a\nmutual explanation that I began to see clearly.",
    "Once I knew that he was\na Pinkerton\u2019s man trailing King Victor my suspicions swung back again\nto their original object.",
    "\u201cThe thing that worried me most was that Mrs. Revel had definitely\nrecognized the woman.",
    "Then I remembered that it was only after\nI had mentioned her being Madame de Breteuil\u2019s governess.",
    "And all\nshe had said was that that accounted for the fact that the woman\u2019s\nface was familiar to her.",
    "Superintendent Battle will tell you that a\ndeliberate plot was formed to keep Mrs. Revel from coming to Chimneys.",
    "Nothing more nor less than a dead body in fact.",
    "And though the murder\nwas the work of the Comrades of the Red Hand punishing supposed\ntreachery on the part of the victim the staging of it and the absence\nof the Comrades\u2019 sign manual pointed to some abler intelligence\ndirecting operations.",
    "From the first I suspected some connection\nwith Herzoslovakia.",
    "Mrs. Revel was the only member of the house party\nwho had been to the country.",
    "I suspected at first that some one was\nimpersonating Prince Michael but that proved to be a totally erroneous\nidea.",
    "When I realized the possibility of Mademoiselle Brun\u2019s being an\nimpostor and added to that the fact that her face was familiar to Mrs.\nRevel I began to see daylight.",
    "It was evidently very important that\nshe should not be recognized and Mrs. Revel was the only person likely\nto do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who was she\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cSome one Mrs. Revel had known\nin Herzoslovakia\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the Baron might be able to tell us\u201d said Anthony.",
    "\u201cI\u201d The Baron stared at him then down at the motionless figure.",

    "\u201cDon\u2019t be put off by the makeup.",
    "She was an\nactress once remember.\u201d\n\nThe Baron stared again.",

    "\u201cShe was\nkilled.",
    "They were both killed.",
    "On the steps of the Palace.",
    "Her body was\nrecovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cMutilated and unrecognizable\u201d Anthony reminded him.",
    "\u201cShe managed to\nput up a bluff.",
    "I think she escaped to America and has spent a good\nmany years lying low in deadly terror of the Comrades of the Red Hand.",
    "They promoted the Revolution remember and to use an expressive\nphrase they always had it in for her.",
    "Then King Victor was released\nand they planned to recover the diamond together.",
    "She was searching\nfor it that night when she came suddenly upon Prince Michael and\nhe recognized her.",
    "There was never much fear of her meeting him in\nthe ordinary way of things.",
    "Royal guests don\u2019t come in contact with\ngovernesses and she could always retire with a convenient migraine\nas she did the day the Baron was here.",
    "\u201cHowever she met Prince Michael face to face when she least expected\nit.",
    "Exposure and disgrace stared her in the face.",
    "She shot him.",
    "It was\nshe who placed the revolver in Isaacstein\u2019s suitcase so as to confuse\nthe trail and she who returned the letters.\u201d\n\nLemoine moved forward.",
    "\u201cShe was coming down to search for the jewel that night you say\u201d\nhe said.",
    "\u201cMight she not have been going to meet her accomplice King\nVictor who was coming from outside Eh What do you say to that\u201d\n\nAnthony sighed.",
    "\u201cStill at it my dear Lemoine How persistent you are You won\u2019t take\nmy hint that I\u2019ve got a trump card up my sleeve\u201d\n\nBut George whose mind worked slowly now broke in.",
    "\u201cI am still completely at sea.",
    "Who was this lady Baron You recognize\nher it seems\u201d\n\nBut the Baron drew himself up and stood very straight and stiff.",
    "\u201cYou are in error Mr. Lomax.",
    "To my knowledge I have not this lady seen\nbefore.",
    "A complete stranger she is to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nGeorge stared at him\u2014bewildered.",
    "The Baron took him into a corner of the room and murmured something\ninto his ear.",
    "Anthony watched with a good deal of enjoyment George\u2019s\nface turning slowly purple his eyes bulging and all the incipient\nsymptoms of apoplexy.",
    "A murmur of George\u2019s throaty voice came to him.",
    "\u201cCertainly ... certainly ... by all means ... no need at all ...\ncomplicate situation ... utmost discretion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d Lemoine hit the table sharply with his hand.",
    "\u201cI do not care about\nall this The murder of Prince Michael\u2014that was not my affair.",
    "I want\nKing Victor.\u201d\n\nAnthony shook his head gently.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry for you Lemoine.",
    "You\u2019re really a very able fellow.",
    "But all\nthe same you\u2019re going to lose the trick.",
    "I\u2019m about to play my trump\ncard.\u201d\n\nHe stepped across the room and rang the bell.",
    "Tredwell answered it.",
    "\u201cA gentleman arrived with me this evening Tredwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir a foreign gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",

    "\u201cAnd yet you know\u201d he said with a queer smile \u201cyou\u2019re all wrong\u201d\n\nHe crossed swiftly to the door and flung it open.",

    "\u201cAllow me to present you to the real Monsieur Lemoine of the S\u00fbret\u00e9.\u201d\n\nThere was a rush and a scuffle and then the nasal tones of Mr. Hiram\nFish rose bland and reassuring from the window.",

    "Besides my doing so puzzled the false Lemoine\nenormously.",
    "You see as soon as I had given the tip about the \u2018rows\u2019\nand where the jewel really was he was keen to pass on the news to\nhis accomplice and at the same time to keep us all in that room.",
    "The\nnote was really to Mademoiselle Brun.",
    "He told Tredwell to deliver it\nat once and Tredwell did so by taking it upstairs to the schoolroom.",
