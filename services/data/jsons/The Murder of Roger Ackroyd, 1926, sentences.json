    "Agatha Christie \n\n\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd \n\nA Hercule Poirot Mystery \n\n\n\nTo Punkie who likes an orthodox detective story murder inquest and \nsuspicion falling on everyone in turn \n\n\n\n\n\nOne \n\n\nDR. SHEPPARD AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE \n\n\nMrs. Ferrars died on the night of the 16th17th September\u2014a Thursday.",
    "I \nwas sent for at eight o\u2019clock on the morning of Friday the 17th.",
    "There was \nnothing to be done.",
    "She had been dead some hours.",
    "It was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more.",
    "I \nopened the front door with my latchkey and purposely delayed a few \nmoments in the hall hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that I had \ndeemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn morning.",
    "To \ntell the truth I was considerably upset and worried.",
    "I am not going to \npretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the next few weeks.",
    "I \nemphatically did not do so.",
    "But my instinct told me that there were stirring \ntimes ahead.",
    "From the dining room on my left there came the rattle of teacups and \nthe short dry cough of my sister Caroline.",
    "\u201cIs that you James\u201d she called.",
    "An unnecessary question since who else could it be To tell the truth it \nwas precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my few minutes\u2019 \ndelay.",
    "The motto of the mongoose family so Mr. Kipling tells us is \u201cGo \nand find out.\u201d If Caroline ever adopts a crest I should certainly suggest a \nmongoose rampant.",
    "One might omit the first part of the motto.",
    "Caroline can \ndo any amount of finding out by sitting placidly at home.",
    "I don\u2019t know how \nshe manages it but there it is.",
    "I suspect that the servants and the tradesmen \nconstitute her Intelligence Corps.",
    "When she goes out it is not to gather in \ninformation but to spread it.",
    "At that too she is amazingly expert.",
    "It was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these \npangs of indecision.",
    "Whatever I told Caroline now concerning the demise \nof Mrs. Ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within the \nspace of an hour and a half.",
    "As a professional man I naturally aim at \ndiscretion.",
    "Therefore I have got into the habit of continually withholding all \n\n\n\ninformation possible from my sister.",
    "She usually finds out just the same but \nI have the moral satisfaction of knowing that I am in no way to blame.",
    "Mrs. Ferrars\u2019 husband died just over a year ago and Caroline has \nconstantly asserted without the least foundation for the assertion that his \nwife poisoned him.",
    "She scorns my invariable rejoinder that Mr. Ferrars died of acute \ngastritis helped on by habitual overindulgence in alcoholic beverages.",
    "The \nsymptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not I agree unlike but \nCaroline bases her accusation on quite different lines.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve only got to look at her\u201d I have heard her say.",
    "Mrs. Ferrars though not in her first youth was a very attractive woman \nand her clothes though simple always seemed to fit her very well but all \nthe same lots of women buy their clothes in Paris and have not on that \naccount necessarily poisoned their husbands.",
    "As I stood hesitating in the hall with all this passing through my mind \nCaroline\u2019s voice came again with a sharper note in it.",
    "\u201cWhat on earth are you doing out there James Why don\u2019t you come \nand get your breakfast\u201d \n\n\u201cJust coming my dear\u201d I said hastily.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve been hanging up my \novercoat.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time.\u201d \n\nShe was quite right.",
    "I could have.",
    "I walked into the dining room gave Caroline the accustomed peck on \nthe cheek and sat down to eggs and bacon.",
    "The bacon was rather cold.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve had an early call\u201d remarked Caroline.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cKing\u2019s Paddock.",
    "Mrs. Ferrars.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know\u201d said my sister.",
    "\u201cHow did you know\u201d \n\n\u201cAnnie told me.\u201d \n\nAnnie is the house parlourmaid.",
    "A nice girl but an inveterate talker.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "I continued to eat eggs and bacon.",
    "My sister\u2019s nose \nwhich is long and thin quivered a little at the tip as it always does when \nshe is interested or excited over anything.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d she demanded.",
    "\u201cA sad business.",
    "Nothing to be done.",
    "Must have died in her sleep.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know\u201d said my sister again.",
    "This time I was annoyed.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t know\u201d I snapped.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t know myself until I got there \nand haven\u2019t mentioned it to a soul yet.",
    "If that girl Annie knows she must be \na clairvoyant.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Annie who told me.",
    "It was the milkman.",
    "He had it from the \nFerrarses\u2019 cook.\u201d \n\nAs I say there is no need for Caroline to go out to get information.",
    "She \nsits at home and it comes to her.",
    "My sister continued \n\n\u201cWhat did she die of Heart failure\u201d \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t the milkman tell you that\u201d I inquired sarcastically.",
    "Sarcasm is wasted on Caroline.",
    "She takes it seriously and answers \naccordingly.",
    "\u201cHe didn\u2019t know\u201d she explained.",
    "After all Caroline was bound to hear sooner or later.",
    "She might as well \nhear from me.",
    "\u201cShe died of an overdose of Veronal.",
    "She\u2019s been taking it lately for \nsleeplessness.",
    "Must have taken too much.\u201d \n\n\u201cNonsense\u201d said Caroline immediately.",
    "\u201cShe took it on purpose.",
    "Don\u2019t \ntell me\u201d \n\nIt is odd when you have a secret belief of your own which you do not \nwish to acknowledge the voicing of it by someone else will rouse you to a \nfury of denial.",
    "I burst immediately into indignant speech.",
    "\u201cThere you go again\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cRushing along without rhyme or reason.",
    "Why on earth should Mrs. Ferrars wish to commit suicide A widow fairly \nyoung still very well off good health and nothing to do but enjoy life.",
    "It\u2019s \nabsurd.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all.",
    "Even you must have noticed how different she has been \nlooking lately.",
    "It\u2019s been coming on for the last six months.",
    "She\u2019s looked \npositively hagridden.",
    "And you have just admitted that she hasn\u2019t been able \nto sleep.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat is your diagnosis\u201d I demanded coldly.",
    "\u201cAn unfortunate love \naffair I suppose\u201d \n\nMy sister shook her head.",
    "\u201cRemorse\u201d she said with great gusto.",
    "\u201cRemorse\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.",
    "You never would believe me when I told you she poisoned her \nhusband.",
    "I\u2019m more than ever convinced of it now.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re very logical\u201d I objected.",
    "\u201cSurely if a woman \ncommitted a crime like murder she\u2019d be sufficiently coldblooded to enjoy \nthe fruits of it without any weakminded sentimentality such as repentance.\u201d \n\nCaroline shook her head.",
    "\u201cThere probably are women like that\u2014but Mrs. Ferrars wasn\u2019t one of \nthem.",
    "She was a mass of nerves.",
    "An overmastering impulse drove her on to \nget rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply can\u2019t \nendure suffering of any kind and there\u2019s no doubt that the wife of a man \nlike Ashley Ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal\u2014\u201d \n\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cAnd ever since she\u2019s been haunted by what she did.",
    "I can\u2019t help feeling \nsorry for her.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t think Caroline ever felt sorry for Mrs. Ferrars whilst she was \nalive.",
    "Now that she has gone where presumably Paris frocks can no longer \nbe worn Caroline is prepared to indulge in the softer emotions of pity and \ncomprehension.",
    "I told her firmly that her whole idea was nonsense.",
    "I was all the more \nfirm because I secretly agreed with some part at least of what she had said.",
    "But it is all wrong that Caroline should arrive at the truth simply by a kind \nof inspired guesswork.",
    "I wasn\u2019t going to encourage that sort of thing.",
    "She \nwill go round the village airing her views and everyone will think that she \nis doing so on medical data supplied by me.",
    "Life is very trying.",
    "\u201cNonsense\u201d said Caroline in reply to my strictures.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll see.",
    "Ten to \none she\u2019s left a letter confessing everything.\u201d \n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t leave a letter of any kind\u201d I said sharply and not seeing \nwhere the admission was going to land me.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d said Caroline.",
    "\u201cSo you did inquire about that did you I believe \nJames that in your heart of hearts you think very much as I do.",
    "You\u2019re a \nprecious old humbug.\u201d \n\n\u201cOne always has to take the possibility of suicide into consideration\u201d I \nsaid impressively.",
    "\u201cWill there be an inquest\u201d \n\n\u201cThere may be.",
    "It all depends.",
    "If I am able to declare myself absolutely \nsatisfied that the overdose was taken accidentally an inquest might be \ndispensed with.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd are you absolutely satisfied\u201d asked my sister shrewdly.",
    "I did not answer but got up from the table.",
    "Two \n\n\nWHO\u2019S WHO IN KING\u2019S ABBOT \n\n\nBefore I proceed further with what I said to Caroline and what Caroline said \nto me it might be as well to give some idea of what I should describe as our \nlocal geography.",
    "Our village.",
    "King\u2019s Abbot is I imagine very much like \nany other village.",
    "Our big town is Cranchester nine miles away.",
    "We have a \nlarge railway station a small post office and two rival \u201cGeneral Stores.\u201d \nAblebodied men are apt to leave the place early in life but we are rich in \nunmarried ladies and retired military officers.",
    "Our hobbies and recreations \ncan be summed up in the one word \u201cgossip.\u201d \n\nThere are only two houses of any importance in King\u2019s Abbot.",
    "One is \nKing\u2019s Paddock left to Mrs. Ferrars by her late husband.",
    "The other Fernly \nPark is owned by Roger Ackroyd.",
    "Ackroyd has always interested me by \nbeing a man more impossibly like a country squire than any country squire \ncould really be.",
    "He reminds one of the redfaced sportsmen who always \nappeared early in the first act of an oldfashioned musical comedy the \nsetting being the village green.",
    "They usually sang a song about going up to \nLondon.",
    "Nowadays we have revues and the country squire has died out of \nmusical fashion.",
    "Of course Ackroyd is not really a country squire.",
    "He is an immensely \nsuccessful manufacturer of I think wagon wheels.",
    "He is a man of nearly \nfifty years of age rubicund of face and genial of manner.",
    "He is hand and \nglove with the vicar subscribes liberally to parish funds though rumour has \nit that he is extremely mean in personal expenditure encourages cricket \nmatches.",
    "Lads\u2019 Clubs and Disabled Soldiers\u2019 Institutes.",
    "He is in fact the \nlife and soul of our peaceful village of King\u2019s Abbot.",
    "Now when Roger Ackroyd was a lad of twentyone he fell in love with \nand married a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior.",
    "Her name \nwas Paton and she was a widow with one child.",
    "The history of the marriage \nwas short and painful.",
    "To put it bluntly Mrs. Ackroyd was a dipsomaniac.",
    "She succeeded in drinking herself into her grave four years after her \nmarriage.",
    "In the years that followed Ackroyd showed no disposition to make a \nsecond matrimonial adventure.",
    "His wife\u2019s child by her first marriage was \nonly seven years old when his mother died.",
    "He is now twentyfive.",
    "Ackroyd \nhas always regarded him as his own son and has brought him up \naccordingly but he has been a wild lad and a continual source of worry and \ntrouble to his stepfather.",
    "Nevertheless we are all very fond of Ralph Paton \nin King\u2019s Abbot.",
    "He is such a goodlooking youngster for one thing.",
    "As I said before we are ready enough to gossip in our village.",
    "Everybody noticed from the first that Ackroyd and Mrs. Ferrars got on very \nwell together.",
    "After her husband\u2019s death the intimacy became more \nmarked.",
    "They were always seen about together and it was freely \nconjectured that at the end of her period of mourning Mrs. Ferrars would \nbecome Mrs. Roger Ackroyd.",
    "It was felt indeed that there was a certain \nfitness in the thing.",
    "Roger Ackroyd\u2019s wife had admittedly died of drink.",
    "Ashley Ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his death.",
    "It was \nonly fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess should make up to \neach other for all that they had previously endured at the hands of their \nformer spouses.",
    "The Ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago but a halo of \ngossip has surrounded Ackroyd for many years past.",
    "All the time that Ralph \nPaton was growing up to manhood a series of lady housekeepers presided \nover Ackroyd\u2019s establishment and each in turn was regarded with lively \nsuspicion by Caroline and her cronies.",
    "It is not too much to say that for at \nleast fifteen years the whole village has confidently expected Ackroyd to \nmarry one of his housekeepers.",
    "The last of them a redoubtable lady called \nMiss Russell has reigned undisputed for five years twice as long as any of \nher predecessors.",
    "It is felt that but for the advent of Mrs. Ferrars Ackroyd \ncould hardly have escaped.",
    "That\u2014and one other factor\u2014the unexpected \narrival of a widowed sisterinlaw with her daughter from Canada.",
    "Mrs. \nCecil Ackroyd widow of Ackroyd\u2019s ne\u2019erdowell younger brother has \ntaken up her residence at Fernley Park and has succeeded according to \nCaroline in putting Miss Russell in her proper place.",
    "I don\u2019t know exactly what a \u201cproper place\u201d constitutes\u2014it sounds chilly \nand unpleasant\u2014but I know that Miss Russell goes about with pinched lips \nand what I can only describe as an acid smile and that she professes the \n\n\n\nutmost sympathy for \u201cpoor Mrs. Ackroyd\u2014dependent on the charity of her \nhusband\u2019s brother.",
    "The bread of charity is so bitter is it not I should be \nquite miserable if I did not work for my living.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know what Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd thought of the Ferrars affair \nwhen it came on the tapis.",
    "It was clearly to her advantage that Ackroyd \nshould remain unmarried.",
    "She was always very charming\u2014not to say \ngushing\u2014to Mrs. Ferrars when they met.",
    "Caroline says that proves less \nthan nothing.",
    "Such have been our preoccupations in King\u2019s Abbot for the last few \nyears.",
    "We have discussed Ackroyd and his affairs from every standpoint.",
    "Mrs. Ferrars has fitted into her place in the scheme.",
    "Now there has been a rearrangement of the kaleidoscope.",
    "From a mild \ndiscussion of probable wedding presents we had been jerked into the midst \nof tragedy.",
    "Revolving these and sundry other matters in my mind I went \nmechanically on my round.",
    "I had no cases of special interest to attend \nwhich was perhaps as well for my thoughts returned again and again to \nthe mystery of Mrs. Ferrars\u2019s death.",
    "Had she taken her own life Surely if \nshe had done so she would have left some word behind to say what she \ncontemplated doing Women in my experience if they once reach the \ndetermination to commit suicide usually wish to reveal the state of mind \nthat led to the fatal action.",
    "They covet the limelight.",
    "When had I last seen her Not for over a week.",
    "Her manner then had \nbeen normal enough considering\u2014well\u2014considering everything.",
    "Then I suddenly remembered that I had seen her though not to speak to \nonly yesterday.",
    "She had been walking with Ralph Paton and I had been \nsurprised because I had had no idea that he was likely to be in King\u2019s \nAbbot.",
    "I thought indeed that he had quarrelled finally with his stepfather.",
    "Nothing had been seen of him down here for nearly six months.",
    "They had \nbeen walking along side by side their heads close together and she had \nbeen talking very earnestly.",
    "I think I can safely say that it was at this moment that a foreboding of \nthe future first swept over me.",
    "Nothing tangible as yet\u2014but a vague \npremonition of the way things were setting.",
    "That earnest teteatete between \nRalph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars the day before struck me disagreeably.",
    "I was still thinking of it when I came face to face with Roger Ackroyd.",
    "\u201cSheppard\u201d he exclaimed.",
    "\u201cJust the man I wanted to get hold of.",
    "This \nis a terrible business.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard then\u201d \n\nHe nodded.",
    "He had felt the blow keenly I could see.",
    "His big red cheeks \nseemed to have fallen in and he looked a positive wreck of his usual jolly \nhealthy self.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s worse than you know\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cLook here Sheppard I\u2019ve \ngot to talk to you.",
    "Can you come back with me now\u201d \n\n\u201cHardly.",
    "I\u2019ve got three patients to see still and I must be back by twelve \nto see my surgery patients.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen this afternoon\u2014no better still dine tonight.",
    "At 730.",
    "Will that \nsuit you\u201d \n\n\u201cYes I can manage that all right.",
    "What\u2019s wrong Is it Ralph\u201d \n\nI hardly knew why I said that\u2014except perhaps that it had so often \nbeen Ralph.",
    "Ackroyd stared blankly at me as though he hardly understood.",
    "I began \nto realize that there must be something very wrong indeed somewhere.",
    "I \nhad never seen Ackroyd so upset before.",
    "\u201cRalph\u201d he said vaguely.",
    "\u201cOh no it\u2019s not Ralph.",
    "Ralph\u2019s in London\u2014 \nDamn Here\u2019s old Miss Gannett coming.",
    "I don\u2019t want to have to talk to her \nabout this ghastly business.",
    "See you tonight Sheppard.",
    "Seventhirty.\u201d \n\nI nodded and he hurried away leaving me wondering.",
    "Ralph in \nLondon But he had certainly been in King\u2019s Abbot the preceding \nafternoon.",
    "He must have gone back to town last night or early this morning \nand yet Ackroyd\u2019s manner had conveyed quite a different impression.",
    "He \nhad spoken as though Ralph had not been near the place for months.",
    "I had no time to puzzle the matter out further.",
    "Miss Gannett was upon \nme thirsting for information.",
    "Miss Gannett has all the characteristics of my \nsister Caroline but she lacks that unerring aim in jumping to conclusions \nwhich lends a touch of greatness to Caroline\u2019s manoeuvres.",
    "Miss Gannett \nwas breathless and interrogatory.",
    "Wasn\u2019t it sad about poor dear Mrs. Ferrars A lot of people were saying \nshe had been a confirmed drugtaker for years.",
    "So wicked the way people \nwent about saying things.",
    "And yet the worst of it was there was usually a \ngrain of truth somewhere in these wild statements.",
    "No smoke without fire \nThey were saying too that Mr. Ackroyd had found out about it and had \nbroken off the engagement\u2014because there was an engagement.",
    "She Miss \n\n\n\nGannett had proof positive of that.",
    "Of course I must know all about it\u2014 \ndoctors always did\u2014but they never tell \n\nAnd all this with a sharp beady eye on me to see how I reacted to these \nsuggestions.",
    "Fortunately long association with Caroline has led me to \npreserve an impassive countenance and to be ready with small \nnoncommittal remarks.",
    "On this occasion I congratulated Miss Gannett on not joining in ill \nnatured gossip.",
    "Rather a neat counterattack I thought.",
    "It left her in \ndifficulties and before she could pull herself together I had passed on.",
    "I went home thoughtful to find several patients waiting for me in the \nsurgery.",
    "I had dismissed the last of them as I thought and was just \ncontemplating a few minutes in the garden before lunch when I perceived \none more patient waiting for me.",
    "She rose and came towards me as I stood \nsomewhat surprised.",
    "I don\u2019t know why I should have been except that there is a suggestion \nof cast iron about Miss Russell a something that is above the ills of the \nflesh.",
    "Ackroyd\u2019s housekeeper is a tall woman handsome but forbidding in \nappearance.",
    "She has a stern eye and lips that shut tightly and I feel that if I \nwere an under housemaid or a kitchenmaid I should run for my life \nwhenever I heard her coming.",
    "\u201cGood morning.",
    "Dr. Sheppard\u201d said Miss Russell.",
    "\u201cI should be much \nobliged if you would take a look at my knee.\u201d \n\nI took a look but truth to tell I was very little wiser when I had done \nso.",
    "Miss Russell\u2019s account of vague pains was so unconvincing that with a \nwoman of less integrity of character I should have suspected a trumpedup \ntale.",
    "It did cross my mind for one moment that Miss Russell might have \ndeliberately invented this affection of the knee in order to pump me on the \nsubject of Mrs. Ferrars\u2019s death but I soon saw that there at least I had \nmisjudged her.",
    "She made a brief reference to the tragedy nothing more.",
    "Yet \nshe certainly seemed disposed to linger and chat.",
    "\u201cWell thank you very much for this bottle of liniment doctor\u201d she said \nat last.",
    "\u201cNot that I believe it will do the least good.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t think it would either but I protested in duty bound.",
    "After all it \ncouldn\u2019t do any harm and one must stick up for the tools of one\u2019s trade.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t believe in all these drugs\u201d said Miss Russell her eyes \nsweeping over my array of bottles disparagingly.",
    "\u201cDrugs do a lot of harm.",
    "Look at the cocaine habit.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell as far as that goes\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very prevalent in high society.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sure Miss Russell knows far more about high society than I do.",
    "I \ndidn\u2019t attempt to argue with her.",
    "\u201cJust tell me this doctor\u201d said Miss Russell.",
    "\u201cSuppose you are really a \nslave of the drug habit is there any cure\u201d \n\nOne cannot answer a question like that offhand.",
    "I gave her a short \nlecture on the subject and she listened with close attention.",
    "I still suspected \nher of seeking information about Mrs. Ferrars.",
    "\u201cNow Veronal for instance\u2014\u201d I proceeded.",
    "But strangely enough she didn\u2019t seem interested in Veronal.",
    "Instead \nshe changed the subject and asked me if it was true that there were certain \npoisons so rare as to baffle detection.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading detective stories.\u201d \n\nShe admitted that she had.",
    "\u201cThe essence of a detective story\u201d I said \u201cis to have a rare poison\u2014if \npossible something from South America that nobody has ever heard of\u2014 \nsomething that one obscure tribe of savages use to poison their arrows with.",
    "Death is instantaneous and Western science is powerless to detect it.",
    "Is that \nthe kind of thing you mean\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Is there really such a thing\u201d \n\nI shook my head regretfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid there isn\u2019t.",
    "There\u2019s curare of course.\u201d \n\nI told her a good deal about curare but she seemed to have lost interest \nonce more.",
    "She asked me if I had any in my poison cupboard and when I \nreplied in the negative I fancy I fell in her estimation.",

    "I must just take these papers to Mr. Ackroyd and I\u2019ll tell him \nyou\u2019re here.\u201d \n\nOn Raymond\u2019s appearance Parker had withdrawn so I was alone in the \nhall.",
    "I settled my tie glanced in a large mirror which hung there and \ncrossed to the door directly facing me which was as I knew the door of the \ndrawing room.",
    "I noticed just as I was turning the handle a sound from within\u2014the \nshutting down of a window I took it to be.",
    "I noticed it I may say quite \nmechanically without attaching any importance to it at the time.",
    "I opened the door and walked in.",
    "As I did so I almost collided with Miss \nRussell who was just coming out.",
    "We both apologized.",
    "For the first time I found myself appraising the housekeeper and \nthinking what a handsome woman she must once have been\u2014indeed as far \nas that goes still was.",
    "Her dark hair was unstreaked with grey and when \nshe had a colour as she had at this minute the stern quality of her looks \nwas not so apparent.",
    "Quite subconsciously I wondered whether she had been out for she was \nbreathing hard as though she had been running.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a few minutes early\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cOh I don\u2019t think so.",
    "It\u2019s gone half past seven Dr. Sheppard.\u201d She \npaused a minute before saying \u201cI\u2014didn\u2019t know you were expected to \ndinner tonight.",
    "Mr. Ackroyd didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d \n\nI received a vague impression that my dining there displeased her in \nsome way but I couldn\u2019t imagine why.",
    "\u201cHow\u2019s the knee\u201d I inquired.",
    "\u201cMuch the same thank you doctor.",
    "I must be going now.",
    "Mrs. Ackroyd \nwill be down in a moment.",
    "I\u2014I only came in here to see if the flowers were \nall right.\u201d \n\nShe passed quickly out of the room.",
    "I strolled to the window wondering \nat her evident desire to justify her presence in the room.",
    "As I did so I saw \nwhat of course I might have known all the time had I troubled to give my \nmind to it namely that the windows were long french ones opening on the \nterrace.",
    "The sound I had heard therefore could not have been that of a \nwindow being shut down.",
    "Quite idly and more to distract my mind from painful thoughts than for \nany other reason I amused myself by trying to guess what could have \ncaused the sound in question.",
    "Coals on the fire No that was not the kind of noise at all.",
    "A drawer of \na bureau pushed in No not that.",
    "Then my eye was caught by what I believe is called a silver table the \nlid of which lifts and through the glass of which you can see the contents.",
    "I \ncrossed over to it studying the contents.",
    "There were one or two pieces of \nold silver a baby shoe belonging to King Charles the First some Chinese \njade figures and quite a number of African implements and curios.",
    "Wanting \nto examine one of the jade figures more closely I lifted the lid.",
    "It slipped \nthrough my fingers and fell.",
    "At once I recognized the sound I had heard.",
    "It was this same table lid \nbeing shut down gently and carefully.",
    "I repeated the action once or twice for \n\n\n\nmy own satisfaction.",
    "Then I lifted the lid to scrutinize the contents more \nclosely.",
    "I was still bending over the open silver table when Flora Ackroyd came \ninto the room.",
    "Quite a lot of people do not like Flora Ackroyd but nobody can help \nadmiring her.",
    "And to her friends she can be very charming.",
    "The first thing \nthat strikes you about her is her extraordinary fairness.",
    "She has the real \nScandinavian pale gold hair.",
    "Her eyes are blue\u2014blue as the waters of a \nNorwegian fiord and her skin is cream and roses.",
    "She has square boyish \nshoulders and slight hips.",
    "And to a jaded medical man it is very refreshing \nto come across such perfect health.",
    "A simple straightforward English girl\u2014I may be oldfashioned but I \nthink the genuine article takes a lot of beating.",
    "Flora joined me by the silver table and expressed heretical doubts as to \nKing Charles I ever having worn the baby shoe.",
    "\u201cAnd anyway\u201d continued Miss Flora \u201call this making a fuss about \nthings because someone wore or used them seems to me all nonsense.",
    "They\u2019re not wearing or using them now.",
    "That pen that George Eliot wrote \nThe Mill on the Floss with\u2014that sort of thing\u2014well it\u2019s only just a pen \nafter all.",
    "If you\u2019re really keen on George Eliot why not get The Mill on the \nFloss in a cheap edition and read it.\u201d \n\n\u201cI suppose you never read such old outofdate stuff Miss Flora\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong Dr. Sheppard.",
    "I love The Mill on the Floss.\u201d \n\nI was rather pleased to hear it.",
    "The things young women read nowadays \nand profess to enjoy positively frighten me.",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t congratulated me yet.",
    "Dr. Sheppard\u201d said Flora.",
    "\u201cHaven\u2019t \nyou heard\u201d \n\nShe held out her left hand.",
    "On the third finger of it was an exquisitely \nset single pearl.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going to marry Ralph you know\u201d she went on.",
    "\u201cUncle is very \npleased.",
    "It keeps me in the family you see.\u201d \n\nI took both her hands in mine.",
    "My dear\u201d I said \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been engaged for about a month\u201d continued Flora in her cool \nvoice \u201cbut it was only announced yesterday.",
    "Uncle is going to do up Cross\u00ac \nstones and give it to us to live in and we\u2019re going to pretend to farm.",
    "Really we shall hunt all the winter town for the season and then go \n\n\n\nyachting.",
    "I love the sea.",
    "And of course I shall take a great interest in the \nparish affairs and attend all the Mothers\u2019 Meetings.\u201d \n\nJust then Mrs. Ackroyd rustled in full of apologies for being late.",
    "I am sorry to say I detest Mrs. Ackroyd.",
    "She is all chains and teeth and \nbones.",
    "A most unpleasant woman.",
    "She has small pale flinty blue eyes and \nhow ever gushing her words may be those eyes of hers always remain \ncoldly speculative.",
    "I went across to her leaving Flora by the window.",
    "She gave me a \nhandful of assorted knuckles and rings to squeeze and began talking \nvolubly.",
    "Had I heard about Flora\u2019s engagement So suitable in every way.",
    "The \ndear young things had fallen in love at first sight.",
    "Such a perfect pair he so \ndark and she so fair.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you my dear Dr. Sheppard the relief to a mother\u2019s heart.\u201d \n\nMrs. Ackroyd sighed\u2014a tribute to her mother\u2019s heart whilst her eyes \nremained shrewdly observant of me.",
    "\u201cI was wondering.",
    "You are such an old friend of dear Roger\u2019s.",
    "We know \nhow much he trusts to your judgment.",
    "So difficult for me\u2014in my position \nas poor Cecil\u2019s widow.",
    "But there are so many tiresome things\u2014settlements \nyou know\u2014all that.",
    "I fully believe that Roger intends to make settlements \nupon dear Flora but as you know he is just a leetle peculiar about money.",
    "Very usual.",
    "I\u2019ve heard amongst men who are captains of industry.",
    "I \nwondered you know if you could just sound him on the subject Flora is so \nfond of you.",
    "We feel you are quite an old friend although we have only \nreally known you just over two years.\u201d \n\nMrs. Ackroyd\u2019s eloquence was cut short as the drawing room door \nopened once more.",
    "I was pleased at the interruption.",
    "I hate interfering in \nother people\u2019s affairs and I had not the least intention of tackling Ackroyd \non the subject of Flora\u2019s settlements.",
    "In another moment I should have been \nforced to tell Mrs. Ackroyd as much.",
    "\u201cYou know Major Blunt don\u2019t you doctor\u201d \n\n\u201cYes indeed\u201d I said.",
    "A lot of people know Hector Blunt\u2014at least by repute.",
    "He has shot \nmore wild animals in unlikely places than any man living I suppose.",
    "When \nyou mention him people say \u201cBlunt\u2014you don\u2019t mean the big game man \ndo you\u201d \n\n\n\nHis friendship with Ackroyd has always puzzled me a little.",
    "The two \nmen are so totally dissimilar.",
    "Hector Blunt is perhaps five years Ackroyd\u2019s \njunior.",
    "They made friends early in life and though their ways have \ndiverged the friendship still holds.",
    "About once in two years Blunt spends a \nfortnight at Fernly and an immense animal\u2019s head with an amazing number \nof horns which fixes you with a glazed stare as soon as you come inside the \nfront door is a permanent reminder of the friendship.",
    "Blunt had entered the room now with his own peculiar deliberate yet \nsoftfooted tread.",
    "He is a man of medium height sturdily and rather stockily \nbuilt.",
    "His face is almost mahogany coloured and is peculiarly \nexpressionless.",
    "He has grey eyes that give the impression of always \nwatching something that is happening very far away.",
    "He talks little and \nwhat he does say is said jerkily as though the words were forced out of him \nunwillingly.",
    "He said now \u201cHow are you Sheppard\u201d in his usual abrupt fashion \nand then stood squarely in front of the fireplace looking over our heads as \nthough he saw something very interesting happening in Timbuctoo.",
    "\u201cMajor Blunt\u201d said Flora \u201cI wish you\u2019d tell me about these African \nthings.",
    "I\u2019m sure you know what they all are.\u201d \n\nI have heard Hector Blunt described as a woman hater but I noticed that \nhe joined Flora at the silver table with what might be described as alacrity.",
    "They bent over it together.",
    "I was afraid Mrs. Ackroyd would begin talking about settlements again \nso I made a few hurried remarks about the new sweet pea.",
    "I knew there was \na newsweet pea because the Daily Mail had told me so that morning.",
    "Mrs. \nAckroyd knows nothing about horticulture but she is the kind of woman \nwho likes to appear wellinformed about the topics of the day and she too \nreads the Daily Mail.",
    "We were able to converse quite intelligently until \nAckroyd and his secretary joined us and immediately afterwards Parker \nannounced dinner.",
    "My place at table was between Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora.",
    "Blunt was on \nMrs. Ackroyd\u2019s other side and Geoffrey Raymond next to him.",
    "Dinner was not a cheerful affair.",
    "Ackroyd was visibly preoccupied.",
    "He \nlooked wretched and ate next to nothing.",
    "Mrs. Ackroyd Raymond and I \nkept the conversation going.",
    "Flora seemed affected by her uncle\u2019s \ndepression and Blunt relapsed into his usual taciturnity.",
    "II \n\n\nImmediately after dinner Ackroyd slipped his arm through mine and led me \noff to his study.",
    "\u201cOnce we\u2019ve had coffee we shan\u2019t be disturbed again\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cI \ntold Raymond to see to it that we shouldn\u2019t be interrupted.\u201d \n\nI studied him quietly without appearing to do so.",
    "He was clearly under \nthe influence of some strong excitement.",
    "For a minute or two he paced up \nand down the room then as Parker entered with the coffee tray he sank \ninto an armchair in front of the fire.",
    "The study was a comfortable apartment.",
    "Bookshelves lined one wall of \nit.",
    "The chairs were big and covered in dark blue leather.",
    "A large desk stood \nby the window and was covered with papers neatly docketed and filed.",
    "On a \nround table were various magazines and sporting papers.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve had a return of that pain after food lately\u201d remarked Ackroyd \ncalmly as he helped himself to coffee.",
    "\u201cYou must give me some more of \nthose tablets of yours.\u201d \n\nIt struck me that he was anxious to convey the impression that our \nconference was a medical one.",
    "I played up accordingly.",
    "\u201cI thought as much.",
    "I brought some up with me.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood man.",
    "Hand them over now.\u201d \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in my bag in the hall.",
    "I\u2019ll get them.\u201d \n\nAckroyd arrested me.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you trouble.",
    "Parker will get them.",
    "Bring in the doctor\u2019s bag will \nyou Parker\u201d \n\n\u201cVery good sir.\u201d \n\nParker withdrew.",
    "As I was about to speak Ackroyd threw up his hand.",
    "\u201cNot yet.",
    "Wait.",
    "Don\u2019t you see I\u2019m in such a state of nerves that I can \nhardly contain myself\u201d \n\nI saw that plainly enough.",
    "And I was very uneasy.",
    "All sorts of \nforebodings assailed me.",
    "Ackroyd spoke again almost immediately.",
    "\u201cMake certain that window\u2019s closed will you\u201d he asked.",
    "Somewhat surprised I got up and went to it.",
    "It was not a french \nwindow but one of the ordinary sash type.",
    "The heavy blue velvet curtains \nwere drawn in front of it but the window itself was open at the top.",
    "Parker reentered the room with my bag while I was still at the window.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all right\u201d I said emerging again into the room.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve put the latch across\u201d \n\n\u201cYes yes.",
    "What\u2019s the matter with you Ackroyd\u201d \n\nThe door had just closed behind Parker or I would not have put the \nquestion.",
    "Ackroyd waited just a minute before replying.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m in hell\u201d he said slowly after a minute.",
    "\u201cNo don\u2019t bother with \nthose damn tablets.",
    "I only said that for Parker.",
    "Servants are so curious.",
    "Come here and sit down.",
    "The door\u2019s closed too isn\u2019t it\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Nobody can overhear don\u2019t be uneasy.\u201d \n\n\u201cSheppard nobody knows what I\u2019ve gone through in the last twenty \nfour hours.",
    "If a man\u2019s house ever fell in ruin about him mine has about me.",
    "This business of Ralph\u2019s is the last straw.",
    "But we won\u2019t talk about that now.",
    "It\u2019s the other\u2014the other\u2014 I don\u2019t know what to do about it.",
    "And I\u2019ve got \nto make up my mind soon.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble\u201d \n\nAckroyd remained silent for a minute or two.",
    "He seemed curiously \naverse to begin.",
    "When he did speak the question he asked came as a \ncomplete surprise.",
    "It was the last thing I expected.",
    "\u201cSheppard you attended Ashley Ferrars in his last illness didn\u2019t you\u201d \n\n\u201cYes I did.\u201d \n\nHe seemed to find even greater difficulty in framing his next question.",
    "\u201cDid you ever suspect\u2014did it ever enter your head\u2014that\u2014well that he \nmight have been poisoned\u201d \n\nI was silent for a minute or two.",
    "Then I made up my mind what to say.",
    "Roger Ackroyd was not Caroline.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAt the time I had no suspicion whatever \nbut since\u2014well it was mere idle talk on my sister\u2019s part that first put the \nidea into my head.",
    "Since then I haven\u2019t been able to get it out again.",
    "But \nmind you.",
    "I\u2019ve no foundation whatever for that suspicion.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe was poisoned\u201d said Ackroyd.",
    "He spoke in a dull heavy voice.",
    "\u201cWho by\u201d I asked sharply.",
    "\u201cHis wife.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow do you know that\u201d \n\n\u201cShe told me so herself.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhen\u201d \n\n\u201cYesterday My God yesterday It seems ten years ago.\u201d \n\n\n\nI waited a minute then he went on.",
    "\u201cYou understand Sheppard I\u2019m telling you this in confidence.",
    "It\u2019s to go \nno further.",
    "I want your advice\u2014I can\u2019t carry the whole weight by myself.",
    "As I said just now I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d \n\n\u201cCan you tell me the whole story\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m still in the dark.",
    "How \ndid Mrs. Ferrars come to make this confession to you\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this.",
    "Three months ago I asked Mrs. Ferrars to marry me.",
    "She \nrefused.",
    "I asked her again and she consented but she refused to allow me to \nmake the engagement public until her year of mourning was up.",
    "Yesterday I \ncalled upon her pointed out that a year and three weeks had now elapsed \nsince her husband\u2019s death and that there could be no further objection to \nmaking the engagement public property.",
    "I had noticed that she had been \nvery strange in her manner for some days.",
    "Now suddenly without the least \nwarning she broke down completely.",
    "She\u2014she told me everything.",
    "Her \nhatred of her brute of a husband her growing love for me and the\u2014the \ndreadful means she had taken.",
    "Poison My God It was murder in cold \nblood.\u201d \n\nI saw the repulsion the horror in Ackroyd\u2019s face.",
    "So Mrs. Ferrars must \nhave seen it.",
    "Ackroyd\u2019s is not the type of the great lover who can forgive all \nfor love\u2019s sake.",
    "He is fundamentally a good citizen.",
    "All that was sound and \nwholesome and lawabiding in him must have turned from her utterly in \nthat moment of revelation.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he went on in a low monotonous voice \u201cshe confessed \neverything.",
    "It seems that there is one person who has known all along\u2014 \nwho has been blackmailing her for huge sums.",
    "It was the strain of that that \ndrove her nearly mad.\u201d \n\n\u201cWho was the man\u201d \n\nSuddenly before my eyes there arose the picture of Ralph Paton and \nMrs. Ferrars side by side.",
    "Their heads so close together.",
    "I felt a momentary \nthrob of anxiety.",
    "Supposing\u2014oh but surely that was impossible.",
    "I \nremembered the frankness of Ralph\u2019s greeting that very afternoon.",
    "Absurd \n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t tell me his name\u201d said Ackroyd slowly.",
    "\u201cAs a matter of \nfact she didn\u2019t actually say that it was a man.",
    "But of course\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course\u201d I agreed.",
    "\u201cIt must have been a man.",
    "And you\u2019ve no \nsuspicion at all\u201d \n\nFor answer Ackroyd groaned and dropped his head into his hands.",
    "\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m mad even to think of such a thing.",
    "No I \nwon\u2019t even admit to you the wild suspicion that crossed my mind.",
    "I\u2019ll tell \nyou this much though.",
    "Something she said made me think that the person \nin question might be actually among my household\u2014but that can\u2019t be so.",
    "I \nmust have misunderstood her.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat did you say to her\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cWhat could I say She saw of course the awful shock it had been to \nme.",
    "And then there was the question what was my duty in the matter She \nhad made me you see an accessory after the fact.",
    "She saw all that I think \nquicker than I did.",
    "I was stunned you know.",
    "She asked me for twentyfour \nhours\u2014made me promise to do nothing till the end of that time.",
    "And she \nsteadfastly refused to give me the name of the scoundrel who had been \nblackmailing her.",
    "I suppose she was afraid that I might go straight off and \nhammer him and then the fat would have been in the fire as far as she was \nconcerned.",
    "She told me that I should hear from her before twentyfour \nhours had passed.",
    "My God I swear to you Sheppard that it never entered \nmy head what she meant to do.",
    "Suicide And I drove her to it.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo no\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take an exaggerated view of things.",
    "The \nresponsibility for her death doesn\u2019t lie at your door.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe question is what am I to do now The poor lady is dead.",
    "Why \nrake up past trouble\u201d \n\n\u201cI rather agree with you\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cBut there\u2019s another point.",
    "How am I to get hold of that scoundrel who \ndrove her to death as surely as if he\u2019d killed her He knew of the first crime \nand he fastened on to it like some obscene vulture.",
    "She\u2019s paid the penalty.",
    "Is \nhe to go scot free\u201d \n\n\u201cI see\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cYou want to hunt him down It will mean a lot of \npublicity you know.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes I\u2019ve thought of that.",
    "I\u2019ve zigzagged to and fro in my mind.\u201d \n\n\u201cI agree with you that the villain ought to be punished but the cost has \ngot to be reckoned.\u201d \n\nAckroyd rose and walked up and down.",
    "Presently he sank into the chair \nagain.",
    "\u201cLook here Sheppard suppose we leave it like this.",
    "If no word comes \nfrom her we\u2019ll let the dead things lie.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by word coming from her\u201d I asked curiously.",
    "\u201cI have the strongest impression that somewhere or somehow she must \nhave left a message for me\u2014before she went.",
    "I can\u2019t argue about it but \nthere it is.\u201d \n\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cShe left no letter or word of any kind\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cSheppard I\u2019m convinced that she did.",
    "And more.",
    "I\u2019ve a feeling that by \ndeliberately choosing death she wanted the whole thing to come out if \nonly to be revenged on the man who drove her to desperation.",
    "I believe that \nif I could have seen her then she would have told me his name and bid me \ngo for him for all I was worth.\u201d \n\nHe looked at me.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in impressions\u201d \n\n\u201cOh yes I do in a sense.",
    "If as you put it word should come from her \n\nI broke off.",
    "The door opened noiselessly and Parker entered with a \nsalver on which were some letters.",
    "\u201cThe evening post sir\u201d he said handing the salver to Ackroyd.",
    "Then he collected the coffee cups and withdrew.",
    "My attention diverted for a moment came back to Ackroyd.",
    "He was \nstaring like a man turned to stone at a long blue envelope.",
    "The other letters \nhe had let drop to the ground.",
    "\u201cHer writing\u201d he said in a whisper.",
    "\u201cShe must have gone out and \nposted it last night just before\u2014before\u2014\u201d \n\nHe ripped open the envelope and drew out a thick enclosure.",
    "Then he \nlooked up sharply.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re sure you shut the window\u201d he said.",

    "So did I.",
    "We both had the impression of hearing the \nlatch of the door give ever so slightly.",
    "I went across to it and opened it.",
    "There was no one there.",
    "\u201cNerves\u201d murmured Ackroyd to himself.",
    "He unfolded the thick sheets of paper and read aloud in a low voice.",

    "I see that \nI saw it in your face this afternoon.",

    "\u201cIt was meant for my eyes and my eyes only.\u201d \n\nHe put the letter in the envelope and laid it on the table.",
    "\u201cLater when I am alone.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo\u201d I cried impulsively \u201cread it now.\u201d \n\nAckroyd stared at me in some surprise.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon\u201d I said reddening.",
    "\u201cI do not mean read it aloud to \nme.",
    "But read it through whilst I am still here.\u201d \n\nAckroyd shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo I\u2019d rather wait.\u201d \n\nBut for some reason obscure to myself I continued to urge him.",
    "\u201cAt least read the name of the man\u201d I said.",
    "Now Ackroyd is essentially pigheaded.",

    "All my arguments were in \nvain.",
    "The letter had been brought in at twenty minutes to nine.",

    "\u201cMr.",
    "Ackroyd particularly does not want to be disturbed\u201d I said coldly.",
    "\u201cHe told me to tell you so.\u201d \n\n\u201cQuite so sir.",
    "I\u2014I fancied I heard the bell ring.\u201d \n\n\n\nThis was such a palpable untruth that I did not trouble to reply.",

    "\u201cThank you mister.\u201d He paused and then added quite unnecessarily \n\u201cI\u2019m a stranger in these parts you see.\u201d \n\nHe went on passing through the gates as I turned to look after him.",
    "The odd thing was that his voice reminded me of someone\u2019s voice that I \nknew but whose it was I could not think.",

    "\u2018Is that Dr. Sheppard Parker \nthe butler at Fernly speaking.",

    "It makes me feel quite uneasy myself.",

    "\u201cCome along.\u201d \n\nI passed through the door on the right Parker on my heels traversed the \nlittle lobby where a small flight of stairs led upstairs to Ackroyd\u2019s bedroom \nand tapped on the study door.",
    "There was no answer.",
    "I turned the handle but the door was locked.",
    "\u201cAllow me sir\u201d said Parker.",
    "Very nimbly for a man of his build he dropped on one knee and applied \nhis eye to the keyhole.",
    "\u201cKey is in the lock all right sir\u201d he said rising.",
    "\u201cOn the inside.",
    "Mr. \nAckroyd must have locked himself in and possibly just dropped off to \nsleep.\u201d \n\nI bent down and verified Parker\u2019s statement.",
    "\u201cIt seems all right\u201d I said \u201cbut all the same Parker I\u2019m going to wake \nyour master up.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t be satisfied to go home without hearing from his \nown lips that he\u2019s quite all right.\u201d \n\nSo saying I rattled the handle and called out \u201cAckroyd Ackroyd just a \nminute.\u201d \n\nBut still there was no answer.",
    "I glanced over my shoulder.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t want to alarm the household\u201d I said hesitatingly.",
    "Parker went across and shut the door from the big hall through which \nwe had come.",
    "\u201cI think that will be all right now sir.",
    "The billiard room is at the other \nside of the house and so are the kitchen quarters and the ladies\u2019 bedrooms.\u201d \n\nI nodded comprehendingly.",
    "Then I banged once more frantically on the \ndoor and stooping down fairly bawled through the keyhole \n\n\u201cAckroyd Ackroyd It\u2019s Sheppard.",
    "Let me in.\u201d \n\n\n\nAnd still\u2014silence.",
    "Not a sign of life from within the locked room.",
    "Parker and I glanced at each other.",
    "\u201cLook here Parker\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019m going to break this door in\u2014or rather \nwe are.",
    "I\u2019ll take the responsibility.\u201d \n\n\u201cIf you say so sir\u201d said Parker rather doubtfully.",
    "\u201cI do say so.",
    "I\u2019m seriously alarmed about Mr. Ackroyd.\u201d \n\nI looked round the small lobby and picked up a heavy oak chair.",
    "Parker \nand I held it between us and advanced to the assault.",
    "Once twice and three \ntimes we hurled it against the lock.",
    "At the third blow it gave and we \nstaggered into the room.",
    "Ackroyd was sitting as I had left him in the armchair before the fire.",
    "His \nhead had fallen sideways and clearly visible just below the collar of his \ncoat was a shining piece of twisted metalwork.",
    "Parker and I advanced till we stood over the recumbent figure.",
    "I heard \nthe butler draw in his breath with a sharp hiss.",
    "\u201cStabbed from be\u2019ind\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u2018\u201cOrrible\u201d \n\nHe wiped his moist brow with his handkerchief then stretched out a \ngingerly hand towards the hilt of the dagger.",
    "\u201cYou mustn\u2019t touch that\u201d I said sharply.",
    "\u201cGo at once to the telephone \nand ring up the police station.",
    "Inform them of what has happened.",
    "Then tell \nMr. Raymond and Major Blunt.\u201d \n\n\u201cVery good sir.\u201d \n\nParker hurried away still wiping his perspiring brow.",
    "I did what little had to be done.",
    "I was careful not to disturb the position \nof the body and not to handle the dagger at all.",
    "No object was to be attained \nby moving it.",
    "Ackroyd had clearly been dead some little time.",
    "Then I heard young Raymond\u2019s voice horrorstricken and incredulous \noutside.",
    "\u201cWhat do you say Oh impossible Where\u2019s the doctor\u201d \n\nHe appeared impetuously in the doorway then stopped dead his face \nvery white.",
    "A hand put him aside and Hector Blunt came past him into the \nroom.",
    "\u201cMy God\u201d said Raymond from behind him \u201cit\u2019s true then.\u201d \n\nBlunt came straight on till he reached the chair.",
    "He bent over the body \nand I thought that like Parker he was going to lay hold of the dagger hilt.",
    "I \ndrew him back with one hand.",
    "\u201cNothing must be moved\u201d I explained.",
    "\u201cThe police must see him \nexactly as he is now.\u201d \n\nBlunt nodded in instant comprehension.",
    "His face was expressionless as \never but I thought I detected signs of emotion beneath the stolid mask.",
    "Geoffrey Raymond had joined us now and stood peering over Blunt\u2019s \nshoulder at the body.",
    "\u201cThis is terrible\u201d he said in a low voice.",
    "He had regained his composure but as he took off the pincenez he \nhabitually wore and polished them I observed that his hand was shaking.",
    "\u201cRobbery I suppose\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHow did the fellow get in Through the \nwindow Has anything been taken\u201d \n\nHe went towards the desk.",
    "\u201cYou think it\u2019s burglary\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cWhat else could it be There\u2019s no question of suicide I suppose\u201d \n\n\u201cNo man could stab himself in such a way\u201d I said confidently.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s \nmurder right enough.",
    "But with what motive\u201d \n\n\u201cRoger hadn\u2019t an enemy in the world\u201d said Blunt quietly.",
    "\u201cMust have \nbeen burglars.",
    "But what was the thief after Nothing seems to be \ndisarranged\u201d \n\nHe looked round the room.",
    "Raymond was still sorting the papers on the \ndesk.",
    "\u201cThere seems nothing missing and none of the drawers show signs of \nhaving been tampered with\u201d the secretary observed at last.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very \nmysterious.\u201d \n\nBlunt made a slight motion with his head.",
    "\u201cThere are some letters on the floor here\u201d he said.",
    "I looked down.",
    "Three or four letters still lay where Ackroyd had \ndropped them earlier in the evening.",
    "But the blue envelope containing Mrs. Ferrar\u2019s letter had disappeared.",
    "I \nhalf opened my mouth to speak but at that moment the sound of a bell \npealed through the house.",
    "There was a confused murmur of voices in the \nhall and then Parker appeared with our local inspector and a police \nconstable.",
    "\u201cGood evening gentlemen\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry for \nthis A good kind gentleman like Mr. Ackroyd.",
    "The butler says it\u2019s murder.",
    "No possibility of accident or suicide doctor\u201d \n\n\u201cNone whatever\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAh A bad business.\u201d \n\nHe came and stood over the body.",
    "\u201cBeen moved at all\u201d he asked sharply.",
    "\u201cBeyond making certain that life was extinct\u2014an easy matter\u2014I have \nnot disturbed the body in any way.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh And everything points to the murderer having got clear away\u2014for \nthe moment that is.",
    "Now then let me hear all about it.",
    "Who found the \nbody\u201d \n\nI explained the circumstances carefully.",
    "\u201cA telephone message you say From the butler\u201d \n\n\u201cA message that I never sent\u201d declared Parker earnestly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve not been \nnear the telephone the whole evening.",
    "The others can bear me out that I \nhaven\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cVery odd that.",
    "Did it sound like Parker\u2019s voice doctor\u201d \n\n\u201cWell\u2014I can\u2019t say I noticed.",
    "I took it for granted you see.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cNaturally.",
    "Well you got up here broke in the door and found poor Mr. \nAckroyd like this.",
    "How long should you say he had been dead doctor\u201d \n\n\u201cHalf an hour at least\u2014perhaps longer\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cThe door was locked on the inside you say What about the window\u201d \n\n\u201cI myself closed and bolted it earlier in the evening at Mr. Ackroyd\u2019s \nrequest.\u201d \n\nThe inspector strode across to it and threw back the curtains.",
    "\u201cWell it\u2019s open now anyway\u201d he remarked.",
    "True enough the window was open the lower sash being raised to its \nfullest extent.",
    "The inspector produced a pocket torch and flashed it along the sill \noutside.",
    "\u201cThis is the way he went all right\u201d he remarked \u201cand got in.",
    "See here.\u201d \n\nIn the light of the powerful torch several clearly defined footmarks \ncould be seen.",
    "They seemed to be those of shoes with rubber studs in the \nsoles.",
    "One particularly clear one pointed inwards another slightly \noverlapping it pointed outwards.",
    "\u201cPlain as a pikestaff\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cAny valuables missing\u201d \n\nGeoffrey Raymond shook his head.",
    "\u201cNot so far that we can discover.",
    "Mr. Ackroyd never kept anything of \nparticular value in this room.\u201d \n\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cMan found an open window.",
    "Climbed in \nsaw Mr. Ackroyd sitting there\u2014maybe he\u2019d fallen asleep.",
    "Man stabbed him \nfrom behind then lost his nerve and made off.",
    "But he\u2019s left his tracks pretty \nclearly.",
    "We ought to get hold of him without much difficulty.",
    "No suspicious \nstrangers been hanging about anywhere\u201d \n\n\u201cOh\u201d I said suddenly.",
    "\u201cWhat is it doctor\u201d \n\n\u201cI met a man this evening\u2014just as I was turning out of the gate.",
    "He \nasked me the way to Fernly Park.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat time would that be\u201d \n\n\u201cJust nine o\u2019clock.",
    "I heard it chime the hour as I was turning out of the \ngate.\u201d \n\n\u201cCan you describe him\u201d \n\nI did so to the best of my ability.",
    "The inspector turned to the butler.",
    "\u201cAnyone answering that description come to the front door\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo sir.",
    "No one has been to the house at all this evening.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat about the back\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so sir but I\u2019ll make inquiries.\u201d \n\nHe moved towards the door but the inspector held up a large hand.",
    "\u201cNo thanks.",
    "I\u2019ll do my own inquiring.",
    "But first of all I want to fix the \ntimes a little more clearly.",
    "When was Mr. Ackroyd last seen alive\u201d \n\n\u201cProbably by me\u201d I said \u201cwhen I left at\u2014let me see\u2014about ten \nminutes to nine.",
    "He told me that he didn\u2019t wish to be disturbed and I \nrepeated the order to Parker.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust so sir\u201d said Parker respectfully.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Ackroyd was certainly alive at half past nine\u201d put in Raymond \n\u201cfor I heard his voice in here talking.\u201d \n\n\u201cWho was he talking to\u201d \n\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t know.",
    "Of course at the time I took it for granted that it \nwas Dr. Sheppard who was with him.",
    "I wanted to ask him a question about \nsome papers I was engaged upon but when I heard the voices I \nremembered that he had said he wanted to talk to Dr. Sheppard without \nbeing disturbed and I went away again.",
    "But now it seems that the doctor \nhad already left\u201d \n\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cI was at home by a quarter past nine\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t go out again \nuntil I received the telephone call.\u201d \n\n\u201cWho could have been with him at half past nine\u201d queried the \ninspector.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you Mr\u2014er\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cMajor Blunt\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cMajor Hector Blunt\u201d asked the inspector a respectful tone creeping \ninto his voice.",
    "Blunt merely jerked his head affirmatively.",
    "\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen you down here before sir\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cI \ndidn\u2019t recognize you for the moment but you were staying with Mr. \nAckroyd a year ago last May.\u201d \n\n\u201cJune\u201d corrected Blunt.",
    "\u201cJust so June it was.",
    "Now as I was saying it wasn\u2019t you with Mr. \nAckroyd at ninethirty this evening\u201d \n\nBlunt shook his head.",
    "\u201cNever saw him after dinner\u201d he volunteered.",
    "The inspector turned once more to Raymond.",
    "\u201cYou didn\u2019t overhear any of the conversation going on did you sir\u201d \n\n\u201cI did catch just a fragment of it\u201d said the secretary \u201cand supposing as \nI did that it was Dr. Sheppard who was with Mr. Ackroyd that fragment \nstruck me as distinctly odd.",
    "As far as I can remember the exact words were \nthese.",
    "Mr. Ackroyd was speaking.",
    "The calls on my purse have been so \nfrequent of late\u2019\u2014that is what he was saying\u2014\u2018of late that I fear it is \nimpossible for me to accede to your request.. .\u2019I went away again at once \nof course so I did not hear any more.",
    "But I rather wondered because Dr. \nSheppard\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2014Does not ask for loans for himself or subscriptions for others\u201d I \nfinished.",
    "\u201cA demand for money\u201d said the inspector musingly.",

    "\u201cYou say \nParker that nobody was admitted by the front door this evening\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I say sir.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen it seems almost certain that Mr. Ackroyd himself must have \nadmitted this stranger.",
    "But I don\u2019t quite see\u2014\u201d \n\nThe inspector went into a kind of daydream for some minutes.",
    "\u201cOne thing\u2019s clear\u201d he said at length rousing himself from his \nabsorption.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Ackroyd was alive and well at ninethirty.",
    "That is the last \nmoment at which he is known to have been alive.\u201d \n\nParker gave vent to an apologetic cough which brought the inspector\u2019s \neyes on him at once.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d he said sharply.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me sir.",
    "Miss Flora saw him after that.\u201d \n\n\u201cMiss Flora\u201d \n\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "About a quarter to ten that would be.",
    "It was after that that she \ntold me Mr. Ackroyd wasn\u2019t to be disturbed again tonight.\u201d \n\n\u201cDid he send her to you with that message\u201d \n\n\u201cNot exactly sir.",
    "I was bringing a tray with soda and whisky when Miss \nFlora who was just coming out of this room stopped me and said her uncle \ndidn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d \n\nThe inspector looked at the butler with rather closer attention than he \nhad bestowed on him up to now.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019d already been told that Mr. Ackroyd didn\u2019t want to be disturbed \nhadn\u2019t you\u201d \n\nParker began to stammer.",
    "His hands shook.",
    "\u201cYes sir.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Quite so sir.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd yet you were proposing to do so\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten sir.",
    "At least I mean I always bring the whisky and soda \nabout that time sir and ask if there\u2019s anything more and I thought\u2014well I \nwas doing as usual without thinking.\u201d \n\nIt was at this moment that it began to dawn upon me that Parker was \nmost suspiciously flustered.",
    "The man was shaking and twitching all over.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cI must see Miss Ackroyd at once.",
    "For the \nmoment we\u2019ll leave this room exactly as it is.",
    "I can return here after I\u2019ve \nheard what Miss Ackroyd has to tell me.",
    "I shall just take the precaution of \nshutting and bolting the window.\u201d \n\nThis precaution accomplished he led the way into the hall and we \nfollowed him.",
    "He paused a moment as he glanced up at the little staircase \nthen spoke over his shoulder to the constable.",
    "\u201cJones you\u2019d better stay here.",
    "Don\u2019t let anyone go into that room.\u201d \n\nParker interposed deferentially.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me sir.",
    "If you were to lock the door into the main hall \nnobody could gain access to this part.",
    "That staircase leads only to Mr. \nAckroyd\u2019s bedroom and bathroom.",
    "There is no communication with the \nother part of the house.",
    "There once was a door through but Mr. Ackroyd \nhad it blocked up.",
    "He liked to feel that his suite was entirely private.\u201d \n\nTo make things clear and explain the position I have appended a rough \nsketch of the righthand wing of the house.",
    "The small staircase leads as \nParker explained to a big bedroom made by two being knocked into one \nand an adjoining bathroom and lavatory.",
    "The inspector took in the position at a glance.",
    "We went through into the \nlarge hall and he locked the door behind him slipping the key into his \npocket.",
    "Then he gave the constable some lowvoiced instructions and the \nlatter prepared to depart.",
    "\u201cWe must get busy on those shoe tracks\u201d explained the inspector.",
    "\u201cBut \nfirst of all I must have a word with Miss Ackroyd.",
    "She was the last person \nto see her uncle alive.",
    "Does she know yet\u201d \n\nRaymond shook his head.",
    "\u201cWell no need to tell her for another five minutes.",
    "She can answer my \nquestions better without being upset by knowing the truth about her uncle.",
    "Tell her there\u2019s been a burglary and ask her if she would mind dressing and \ncoming down to answer a few questions.\u201d \n\n\n\nIt was Raymond who went upstairs on this errand.",
    "\u201cMiss Ackroyd will be down in a minute\u201d he said when he returned.",
    "\u201cI \ntold her just what you suggested.\u201d \n\nIn less than five minutes Flora descended the staircase.",
    "She was \nwrapped in a pale pink silk kimono.",
    "She looked anxious and excited.",
    "The inspector stepped forward.",
    "\u201cGood evening.",
    "Miss Ackroyd\u201d he said civilly.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid there\u2019s \nbeen an attempt at robbery and we want you to help us.",
    "What\u2019s this room\u2014 \nthe billiard room Come in here and sit down.\u201d \n\nFlora sat down composedly on the wide divan which ran the length of \nthe wall and looked up at the inspector.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand.",
    "What has been stolen What do you want me \nto tell you\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just this.",
    "Miss Ackroyd.",
    "Parker here says you came out of your \nuncle\u2019s study at about a quarter to ten.",
    "Is that right\u201d \n\n\u201cQuite right.",
    "I had been to say goodnight to him.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd the time is correct\u201d \n\n\u201cWell it must have been about then.",
    "I can\u2019t say exactly.",
    "It might have \nbeen later.\u201d \n\n\u201cWas your uncle alone or was there anyone with him\u201d \n\n\u201cHe was alone.",
    "Dr. Sheppard had gone.\u201d \n\n\u201cDid you happen to notice whether the window was open or shut\u201d \n\nFlora shook her head.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t say.",
    "The curtains were drawn.\u201d \n\n\u201cExactly.",
    "And your uncle seemed quite as usual\u201d \n\n\u201cI think so.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you mind telling us exactly what passed between you\u201d \n\nFlora paused a minute as though to collect her recollections.",
    "\u201cI went in and said \u2018Goodnight Uncle I\u2019m going to bed now.",
    "I\u2019m tired \ntonight.\u2019 He gave a sort of grunt and\u2014I went over and kissed him and he \nsaid something about my looking nice in the frock I had on and then he \ntold me to run away as he was busy.",
    "Sol went.\u201d \n\n\u201cDid he ask specially not to be disturbed\u201d \n\n\u201cOh yes I forgot.",
    "He said \u2018Tell Parker I don\u2019t want anything more \ntonight and that he\u2019s not to disturb me.\u2019 I met Parker just outside the door \nand gave him Uncle\u2019s message.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust so\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cWon\u2019t you tell me what it is that has been stolen\u201d \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not quite\u2014certain\u201d said the inspector hesitatingly.",
    "A wide look of alarm came into the girl\u2019s eyes.",
    "She started up.",
    "\u201cWhat is it You\u2019re hiding something from me\u201d \n\nMoving in his usual unobtrusive manner Hector Blunt came between \nher and the inspector.",
    "She half stretched out her hand and he took it in both \nof his patting it as though she were a very small child and she turned to \nhim as though something in his stolid rocklike demeanour promised \ncomfort and safety.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s bad news.",
    "Flora\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cBad news for all of us.",
    "Your \nUncle Roger\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u201d \n\n\u201cIt will be a shock to you.",
    "Bound to be.",
    "Poor Roger\u2019s dead.\u201d \n\nFlora drew away from him her eyes dilating with horror.",
    "\u201cWhen\u201d she whispered.",
    "\u201cWhen\u201d \n\n\u201cVery soon after you left him I\u2019m afraid\u201d said Blunt gravely.",
    "Flora raised her hand to her throat gave a little cry and I hurried to \ncatch her as she fell.",
    "She had fainted and Blunt and I carried her upstairs \nand laid her on her bed.",
    "Then I got him to wake Mrs. Ackroyd and tell her \nthe news.",
    "Flora soon revived and I brought her mother to her telling her \nwhat to do for the girl.",
    "Then I hurried downstairs again.",
    "Six \n\n\nTHE TUNISIAN DAGGER \n\n\nI met the inspector just coming from the door which led into the kitchen \nquarters.",
    "\u201cHow\u2019s the young lady doctor\u201d \n\n\u201cComing round nicely.",
    "Her mother\u2019s with her.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.",
    "I\u2019ve been questioning the servants.",
    "They all declare that \nno one has been to the back door tonight.",
    "Your description of that stranger \nwas rather vague.",
    "Can\u2019t you give us something more definite to go upon\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not\u201d I said regretfully.",
    "\u201cIt was a dark night you see and the \nfellow had his coat collar well pulled up and his hat squashed down over his \neyes.\u201d \n\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cLooked as though he wanted to conceal his \nface.",
    "Sure it was no one you know\u201d \n\nI replied in the negative but not as decidedly as I might have done.",
    "I \nremembered my impression that the stranger\u2019s voice was not unfamiliar to \nme.",
    "I explained this rather haltingly to the inspector.",
    "\u201cIt was a rough uneducated voice you say\u201d \n\nI agreed but it occurred to me that the roughness had been of an almost \nexaggerated quality.",
    "If as the inspector thought the man had wished to hide \nhis face he might equally well have tried to disguise his voice.",
    "\u201cDo you mind coming into the study with me again doctor There are \none or two things I want to ask you.\u201d \n\nI acquiesced.",
    "Inspector Davis unlocked the door of the lobby we passed \nthrough and he locked the door again behind him.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be disturbed\u201d he said grimly.",
    "\u201cAnd we don\u2019t want \nany eavesdropping either.",
    "What\u2019s all this about blackmail\u201d \n\n\u201cBlackmail\u201d I exclaimed very much startled.",
    "\u201cIs it an effort of Parker\u2019s imagination Or is there something in it\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIf Parker heard anything about blackmail\u201d I said slowly \u201che must \nhave been listening outside this door with his ear glued against the \nkeyhole.\u201d \n\nDavis nodded.",
    "\u201cNothing more likely.",
    "You see.",
    "I\u2019ve been instituting a few inquiries as to \nwhat Parker has been doing with himself this evening.",
    "To tell the truth I \ndidn\u2019t like his manner.",
    "The man knows something.",
    "When I began to \nquestion him he got the wind up and plumped out some garbled story of \nblackmail.\u201d \n\nI took an instant decision.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m rather glad you\u2019ve brought the matter up\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve been trying \nto decide whether to make a clean breast of things or not.",
    "I\u2019d already \npractically decided to tell you everything but I was going to wait for a \nfavourable opportunity.",
    "You might as well have it now.\u201d \n\nAnd then and there I narrated the whole events of the evening as I have \nset them down here.",
    "The inspector listened keenly occasionally interjecting \na question.",
    "\u201cMost extraordinary story I ever heard\u201d he said when I had finished.",
    "\u201cAnd you say that letter has completely disappeared It looks bad\u2014it looks \nvery bad indeed.",
    "It gives us what we\u2019ve been looking for\u2014a motive for the \nmurder.\u201d \n\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cI realize that.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou say that Mr. Ackroyd hinted at a suspicion he had that some \nmember of his household was involved Household\u2019s rather an elastic \nterm.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think that Parker himself might be the man we\u2019re after\u201d I \nsuggested.",
    "\u201cIt looks very like it.",
    "He was obviously listening at the door when you \ncame out.",
    "Then Miss Ackroyd came across him later bent on entering the \nstudy.",
    "Say he tried again when she was safely out of the way.",
    "He stabbed \nAckroyd locked the door on the inside opened the window and got out \nthat way and went round to a side door which he had previously left open.",
    "How\u2019s that\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing against it\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cIf Ackroyd went on \nreading that letter as soon as I left as he intended to do I don\u2019t see him \ncontinuing to sit on here and turn things over in his mind for another hour.",
    "He\u2019d have had Parker in at once accused him then and there and there \nwould have been a fine old uproar.",
    "Remember Ackroyd was a man of \ncholeric temper.\u201d \n\n\u201cMightn\u2019t have had time to go on with the letter just then\u201d suggested \nthe inspector.",
    "\u201cWe know someone was with him at half past nine.",
    "If that \nvisitor turned up as soon as you left and after he went.",
    "Miss Ackroyd came \nin to say goodnight\u2014well he wouldn\u2019t be able to go on with the letter until \nclose upon ten o\u2019clock.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd the telephone call\u201d \n\n\u201cParker sent that all right\u2014perhaps before he thought of the locked \ndoor and open window.",
    "Then he changed his mind\u2014or got in a panic\u2014and \ndecided to deny all knowledge of it.",
    "That was it depend upon it.\u201d \n\n\u201cYe\u2014es\u201d I said rather doubtfully.",
    "\u201cAnyway we can find out the truth about the telephone call from the \nexchange.",
    "If it was put through from here I don\u2019t see how anyone else but \nParker could have sent it.",
    "Depend upon it he\u2019s our man.",
    "But keep it dark\u2014 \nwe don\u2019t want to alarm him just yet till we\u2019ve got all the evidence.",
    "I\u2019ll see \nto it he doesn\u2019t give us the slip.",
    "To all appearances we\u2019ll be concentrating \non your mysterious stranger.\u201d \n\nHe rose from where he had been sitting astride the chair belonging to \nthe desk and crossed over to the still form in the armchair.",
    "\u201cThe weapon ought to give us a clue\u201d he remarked looking up.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s \nsomething quite unique\u2014a curio I should think by the look of it.\u201d \n\nHe bent down surveying the handle attentively and I heard him give a \ngrunt of satisfaction.",
    "Then very gingerly he pressed his hands down below \nthe hilt and drew the blade out from the wound.",
    "Still carrying it so as not to \ntouch the handle he placed it in a wide china mug which adorned the \nmantelpiece.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said nodding at it.",
    "\u201cQuite a work of art.",
    "There can\u2019t be many \nof them about.\u201d \n\nIt was indeed a beautiful object.",
    "A narrow tapering blade and a hilt of \nelaborately intertwined metals of curious and careful workmanship.",
    "He \ntouched the blade gingerly with his finger testing its sharpness and made \nan appreciative grimace.",
    "\u201cLord what an edge\u201d he exclaimed.",
    "\u201cA child could drive that into a \nman\u2014as easy as cutting butter.",
    "A dangerous sort of toy to have about.\u201d \n\n\u201cMay I examine the body properly now\u201d I asked.",
    "He nodded.",
    "\u201cGo ahead.\u201d \n\nI made a thorough examination.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said the inspector when I had finished.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll spare you the technical language\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll keep that for the \ninquest.",
    "The blow was delivered by a righthanded man standing behind \nhim and death must have been instantaneous.",
    "By the expression on the \ndead man\u2019s face I should say that the blow was quite unexpected.",
    "He may \nhave died without knowing who his assailant was.\u201d \n\n\u201cButlers can creep about as softfooted as cats\u201d said Inspector Davis.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be much mystery about this crime.",
    "Take a look at the \nhilt of that dagger.\u201d \n\nI took the look.",
    "\u201cI dare say they\u2019re not apparent to you but I can see them clearly \nenough.\u201d He lowered his voice.",
    "\u201c Fingerprints \u201d \n\nHe stood off a few steps to judge of his effect.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d I said mildly.",
    "\u201cI guessed that.\u201d \n\nI do not see why I should be supposed to be totally devoid of \nintelligence.",
    "After all I read detective stories and the newspapers and am a \nman of quite average ability.",
    "If there had been toe marks on the dagger \nhandle now that would have been quite a different thing.",
    "I would then have \nregistered any amount of surprise and awe.",
    "I think the inspector was annoyed with me for declining to get thrilled.",
    "He picked up the china mug and invited me to accompany him to the \nbilliard room.",
    "\u201cI want to see if Mr. Raymond can tell us anything about this dagger\u201d \nhe explained.",
    "Locking the outer door behind us again we made our way to the billiard \nroom where we found Geoffrey Raymond.",
    "The inspector held up his \nexhibit.",
    "\u201cEver seen this before Mr. Raymond\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy\u2014I believe\u2014I\u2019m almost sure that is a curio given to Mr. Ackroyd \nby Major Blunt.",
    "It comes from Morocco\u2014no Tunis.",
    "So the crime was \ncommitted with that What an extraordinary thing.",
    "It seems almost \nimpossible and yet there could hardly be two daggers the same.",
    "May I fetch \nMajor Blunt\u201d \n\nWithout waiting for an answer he hurried off.",
    "\u201cNice young fellow that\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cSomething honest and \ningenuous about him.\u201d \n\nI agreed.",
    "In the two years that Geoffrey Raymond has been secretary to \nAckroyd I have never seen him ruffled or out of temper.",
    "And he has been I \nknow a most efficient secretary.",
    "In a minute or two Raymond returned accompanied by Blunt.",
    "\u201cI was right\u201d said Raymond excitedly.",
    "\u201cIt is the Tunisian dagger.\u201d \n\n\u201cMajor Blunt hasn\u2019t looked at it yet\u201d objected the inspector.",
    "\u201cSaw it the moment I came into the study\u201d said the quiet man.",
    "\u201cYou recognized it then\u201d \n\nBlunt nodded.",
    "\u201cYou said nothing about it\u201d said the inspector suspiciously.",
    "\u201cWrong moment\u201d said Blunt.",
    "\u201cLot of harm done by blurting out things \nat the wrong time.\u201d \n\nHe returned the inspector\u2019s stare placidly enough.",
    "The latter grunted at last and turned away.",
    "He brought the dagger over \nto Blunt.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re quite sure about it sir.",
    "You identify it positively\u201d \n\n\u201cAbsolutely.",
    "No doubt whatever.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere was this\u2014er\u2014curio usually kept Can you tell me that sir\u201d \n\nIt was the secretary who answered.",
    "\u201cIn the silver table in the drawing room.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "The others looked at me.",
    "\u201cYes doctor\u201d said the inspector encouragingly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u201d said the inspector again still encouragingly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s so trivial\u201d I explained apologetically.",
    "\u201cOnly that when I arrived \nlast night for dinner I heard the lid of the silver table being shut down in the \ndrawing room.\u201d \n\nI saw profound scepticism and a trace of suspicion on the inspector\u2019s \ncountenance.",
    "\u201cHow did you know it was the silver table lid\u201d \n\nI was forced to explain in detail\u2014a long tedious explanation which I \nwould infinitely rather not have had to make.",
    "The inspector heard me to the end.",
    "\u201cWas the dagger in its place when you were looking over the contents\u201d \nhe asked.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t say I remember noticing it\u2014but of \ncourse it may have been there all the time.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get hold of the housekeeper\u201d remarked the inspector and \npulled the bell.",
    "A few minutes later Miss Russell summoned by Parker entered the \nroom.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think I went near the silver table\u201d she said when the inspector \nhad posed his question.",
    "\u201cI was looking to see that all the flowers were fresh.",
    "Oh yes I remember now.",
    "The silver table was open\u2014which it had no \nbusiness to be and I shut the lid down as I passed.\u201d \n\nShe looked at him aggressively.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cCan you tell me if this dagger was in its \nplace then\u201d \n\nMiss Russell looked at the weapon composedly.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m sure\u201d she replied.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t stop to look.",
    "I knew the \nfamily would be down any minute and I wanted to get away.\u201d \n\n\u201cThank you\u201d said the inspector.",
    "There was just a trace of hesitation in his manner as though he would \nhave liked to question her further but Miss Russell clearly accepted the \nwords as a dismissal and glided from the room.",
    "\u201cRather a Tartar I should fancy eh\u201d said the inspector looking after \nher.",
    "\u201cLet me see.",
    "This silver table is in front of one of the windows I think \nyou said doctor\u201d \n\nRaymond answered for me.",
    "\u201cYes the lefthand window.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd the window was open\u201d \n\n\u201cThey were both ajar.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t think we need go into the question much further.",
    "Somebody\u2014I\u2019ll just say somebody\u2014could get that dagger any time he \nliked and exactly when he got it doesn\u2019t matter in the least.",
    "I\u2019ll be coming \nup in the morning with the chief constable Mr. Raymond.",
    "Until then I\u2019ll \nkeep the key of that door.",
    "I want Colonel Melrose to see everything exactly \nas it is.",
    "I happen to know that he\u2019s dining out the other side of the county \nand I believe staying the night....\u201d \n\nWe watched the inspector take up the jar.",

    "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an \nimportant piece of evidence in more ways than one.\u201d \n\n\n\nA few minutes later as I came out of the billiard room with Raymond \nthe latter gave a low chuckle of amusement.",

    "\u201cSo Parker is the suspect \nis he Shall we oblige Inspector Davis with a set of our fingerprints also\u201d \n\nHe took two cards from the card tray wiped them with his silk \nhandkerchief then handed one to me and took the other himself.",
    "Then with \na grin he handed them to the police inspector.",

    "\u201cOne must always proceed with method.",
    "I made an error of judgment in \nasking you that question.",
    "To each man his own knowledge.",
    "You could tell \n\n\n\nme the details of the patient\u2019s appearance\u2014nothing there would escape you.",
    "If I wanted information about the papers on that desk Mr. Raymond would \nhave noticed anything there was to see.",
    "To find out about the fire I must \nask the man whose business it is to observe such things.",
    "You permit\u2014\u201d \n\nHe moved swiftly to the fireplace and rang the bell.",
    "After a lapse of a minute or two Parker appeared.",
    "\u201cThe bell rang sir\u201d he said hesitatingly.",
    "\u201cCome in Parker\u201d said Colonel Melrose.",
    "\u201cThis gentleman wants to ask \nyou something.\u201d \n\nParker transferred a respectful attention to Poirot.",
    "\u201cParker\u201d said the little man \u201cwhen you broke down the door with Dr. \nSheppard last night and found your master dead what was the state of the \nfire\u201d \n\nParker replied without a pause.",
    "\u201cIt had burned very low sir.",
    "It was almost out.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot.",
    "The exclamation sounded almost triumphant.",
    "He \nwent on \n\n\u201cLook round you my good Parker.",
    "Is this room exactly as it was then\u201d \n\nThe butler\u2019s eye swept round.",
    "It came to rest on the windows.",

    "\u201cAnything else\u201d \n\n\u201cYes sir this chair was drawn out a little more.\u201d \n\nHe indicated a big grandfather chair to the left of the door between it \nand the window.",
    "I append a plan of the room with the chair in question \nmarked with an X.",
    "\u201cJust show me\u201d said Poirot.",
    "The butler drew the chair in question out a good two feet from the wall \nturning it so that the seat faced the door.",
    "\u201cVoila ce qui est curieux\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cNo one would want to sit \nin a chair in such a position I fancy.",
    "Now who pushed it back into place \nagain I wonder Did you my friend\u201d \n\n\u201cNo sir\u201d said Parker.",
    "\u201cI was too upset with seeing the master and all.\u201d \n\nPoirot looked across at me.",
    "\u201cDid you doctor\u201d \n\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cIt was back in position when I arrived with the police sir\u201d put in \nParker.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure of that.\u201d \n\n\u201cCurious\u201d said Poirot again.",
    "\u201cRaymond or Blunt must have pushed it back\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cSurely it \nisn\u2019t important\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is completely unimportant\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat is why it is so \ninteresting\u201d he added softly.",
    "\u201cExcuse me a minute\u201d said Colonel Melrose.",
    "He left the room with \nParker.",
    "\u201cDo you think Parker is speaking the truth\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cAbout the chair yes.",
    "Otherwise I do not know.",
    "You will find M. le \ndocteur if you have much to do with cases of this kind that they all \nresemble each other in one thing.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d I asked curiously.",
    "\u201cEveryone concerned in them has something to hide.\u201d \n\n\u201cHave I\u201d I asked smiling.",
    "Poirot looked at me attentively.",
    "\u201cI think you have\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cHave you told me everything known to you about this young man \nPaton\u201d He smiled as I grew red.",
    "\u201cOh do not fear.",
    "I will not press you.",
    "I \nshall learn it in good time.\u201d \n\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d tell me something of your methods\u201d I said hastily to \ncover my confusion.",
    "\u201cThe point about the fire for instance\u201d \n\n\u201cOh that was very simple.",
    "You leave Mr. Ackroyd at\u2014ten minutes to \nnine was it not\u201d \n\n\u201cYes exactly I should say.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe window is then closed and bolted and the door unlocked.",
    "At a \nquarter past ten when the body is discovered the door is locked and the \nwindow is open.",
    "Who opened it Clearly only Mr. Ackroyd himself could \nhave done so and for one of two reasons.",
    "Either because the room became \nunbearably hot but since the fire was nearly out and there was a sharp drop \nin temperature last night that cannot be the reason or because he admitted \nsomeone that way.",
    "And if he admitted someone that way it must have been \nsomeone well known to him since he had previously shown himself uneasy \non the subject of that same window.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt sounds very simple\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cEverything is simple if you arrange the facts methodically.",
    "We are \nconcerned now with the personality of the person who was with him at \nninethirty last night.",
    "Everything goes to show that that was the individual \nadmitted by the window and though Mr. Ackroyd was seen alive later by \nMiss Flora we cannot approach a solution of the mystery until we know \nwho that visitor was.",
    "The window may have been left open after his \ndeparture and so afforded entrance to the murderer or the same person may \nhave returned a second time.",
    "Ah here is the colonel who returns.\u201d \n\nColonel Melrose entered with an animated manner.",
    "\u201cThat telephone call has been traced at last\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt did not come \nfrom here.",
    "It was put through to Dr. Sheppard at 1015 last night from a \npublic call office at King\u2019s Abbot station.",
    "And at 1023 the night mail \nleaves for Liverpool.\u201d \n\n\n\nEight \n\n\nINSPECTOR RAGLAN IS CONFIDENT \n\n\nWe looked at each other.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll have inquiries made at the station of course\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cNaturally but I\u2019m not over sanguine as to the result.",
    "You know what \nthat station is like.\u201d \n\nI did.",
    "King\u2019s Abbot is a mere village but its station happens to be an \nimportant junction.",
    "Most of the big expresses stop there and trains are \nshunted resorted and made up.",
    "It has two or three public telephone boxes.",
    "At that time of night three local trains come in close upon each other to \ncatch the connection with the express for the north which comes in at 1019 \nand leaves at 1023.",
    "The whole place is in a bustle and the chances of one \nparticular person being noticed telephoning or getting into the express are \nvery small indeed.",
    "\u201cBut why telephone at all\u201d demanded Melrose.",
    "\u201cThat is what I find so \nextraordinary.",
    "There seems no rhyme or reason in the thing.\u201d \n\nPoirot carefully straightened a china ornament on one of the bookcases.",
    "\u201cBe sure there was a reason\u201d he said over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cBut what reason could it be\u201d \n\n\u201cWhen we know that we shall know everything.",
    "This case is very \ncurious and very interesting.\u201d \n\nThere was something almost indescribable in the way he said those last \nwords.",
    "I felt that he was looking at the case from some peculiar angle of his \nown and what he saw I could not tell.",
    "He went to the window and stood there looking out.",
    "\u201cYou say it was nine o\u2019clock.",
    "Dr. Sheppard when you met this stranger \noutside the gate\u201d \n\nHe asked the question without turning round.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d I replied.",
    "\u201cI heard the church clock chime the hour.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHow long would it take him to reach the house\u2014to reach this window \nfor instance\u201d \n\n\u201cFive minutes at the outside.",
    "Two or three minutes only if he took the \npath at the right of the drive and came straight here.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut to do that he would have to know the way.",
    "How can I explain \nmyself\u2014it would mean that he had been here before\u2014that he knew his \nsurroundings.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is true\u201d replied Colonel Melrose.",
    "\u201cWe could find out doubtless if Mr. Ackroyd had received any \nstrangers during the past week\u201d \n\n\u201cYoung Raymond could tell us that\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cOr Parker\u201d suggested Colonel Melrose.",
    "\u201cOu tous les deux \u201d suggested Poirot smiling.",
    "Colonel Melrose went in search of Raymond and I rang the bell once \nmore for Parker.",
    "Colonel Melrose returned almost immediately accompanied by the \nyoung secretary whom he introduced to Poirot.",
    "Geoffrey Raymond was \nfresh and debonair as ever.",
    "He seemed surprised and delighted to make \nPoirot\u2019s acquaintance.",
    "\u201cNo idea you\u2019d been living among us incognito M. Poirot\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt \nwill be a great privilege to watch you at work\u2014Hallo what\u2019s this\u201d \n\nPoirot had been standing just to the left of the door.",
    "Now he moved \naside suddenly and I saw that while my back was turned he must have \nswiftly drawn out the armchair till it stood in the position Parker had \nindicated.",
    "\u201cWant me to sit in the chair whilst you take a blood test\u201d asked \nRaymond goodhumouredly.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the idea\u201d \n\n\u201cM.",
    "Raymond this chair was pulled out\u2014so\u2014last night when Mr. \nAckroyd was found killed.",
    "Someone moved it back again into place.",
    "Did \nyou do so\u201d \n\nThe secretary\u2019s reply came without a second\u2019s hesitation.",
    "\u201cNo indeed I didn\u2019t.",
    "I don\u2019t even remember that it was in that position \nbut it must have been if you say so.",
    "Anyway somebody else must have \nmoved it back to its proper place.",
    "Have they destroyed a clue in doing so \nToo bad\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is of no consequence\u201d said the detective.",
    "\u201cOf no consequence \nwhatever.",
    "What I really want to ask you is this M. Raymond Did any \n\n\n\nstranger come to see Mr. Ackroyd during this past week\u201d \n\nThe secretary reflected for a minute or two knitting his brows and \nduring the pause Parker appeared in answer to the bell.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d said Raymond at last.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t remember anyone.",
    "Can you \nParker\u201d \n\n\u201cI beg your pardon sir\u201d \n\n\u201cAny stranger coming to see Mr. Ackroyd this week\u201d \n\nThe butler reflected for a minute or two.",
    "\u201cThere was the young man who came on Wednesday sir\u201d he said at \nlast.",
    "\u201cFrom Curtis and Troute I understood he was.\u201d \n\nRaymond moved this aside with an impatient hand.",
    "\u201cOh yes I remember but that is not the kind of stranger this gentleman \nmeans.\u201d He turned to Poirot.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Ackroyd had some idea of purchasing a \ndictaphone\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cIt would have enabled us to get through a lot \nmore work in a limited time.",
    "The firm in question sent down their \nrepresentative but nothing came of it.",
    "Mr. Ackroyd did not make up his \nmind to purchase.\u201d \n\nPoirot turned to the butler.",
    "\u201cCan you describe this young man to me my good Parker\u201d \n\n\u201cHe was fairhaired sir and short.",
    "Very neatly dressed in a blue serge \nsuit.",
    "A very presentable young man sir for his station in life.\u201d \n\nPoirot turned to me.",
    "\u201cThe man you met outside the gate doctor was tall was he not\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cSomewhere about six feet I should say.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere is nothing in that then\u201d declared the Belgian.",
    "\u201cI thank you \nParker.\u201d \n\nThe butler spoke to Raymond.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Hammond has just arrived sir\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHe is anxious to know if \nhe can be of any service and he would be glad to have a word with you.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come at once\u201d said the young man.",
    "He hurried out.",
    "Poirot looked \ninquiringly at the chief constable.",
    "\u201cThe family solicitor M. Poirot\u201d said the latter.",
    "\u201cIt is a busy time for this young M. Raymond\u201d murmured M. Poirot.",
    "\u201cHe has the air efficient that one.\u201d \n\n\u201cI believe Mr. Ackroyd considered him a most able secretary.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe has been here\u2014how long\u201d \n\n\u201cJust on two years I fancy.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHis duties he fulfils punctiliously.",
    "Of that I am sure.",
    "In what manner \ndoes he amuse himself Does he go in for le sport\u201d \n\n\u201cPrivate secretaries haven\u2019t much time for that sort of thing\u201d said \nColonel Melrose smiling.",
    "\u201cRaymond plays golf I believe.",
    "And tennis in \nthe summer time.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe does not attend the courses\u2014I should say the running of the \nhorses\u201d \n\n\u201cRace meetings No I don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested in racing.\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded and seemed to lose interest.",
    "He glanced slowly round the \nstudy.",
    "\u201cI have seen I think all that there is to be seen here.\u201d \n\nI too looked round.",
    "\u201cIf those walls could speak\u201d I murmured.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cA tongue is not enough\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThey would have to have also eyes \nand ears.",
    "But do not be too sure that these dead things\u201d\u2014he touched the top \nof the bookcase as he spoke\u2014\u201care always dumb.",
    "To me they speak \nsometimes\u2014chairs tables\u2014they have their message\u201d \n\nHe turned away towards the door.",
    "\u201cWhat message\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cWhat have they said to you today\u201d \n\nHe looked over his shoulder and raised one eyebrow quizzically.",
    "\u201cAn opened window\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cA locked door.",
    "A chair that apparently \nmoved itself.",
    "To all three I say \u2018Why\u2019 and I find no answer.\u201d \n\nHe shook his head puffed out his chest and stood blinking at us.",
    "He \nlooked ridiculously full of his own importance.",
    "It crossed my mind to \nwonder whether he was really any good as a detective.",
    "Had his big \nreputation been built up on a series of lucky chances \n\nI think the same thought must have occurred to Colonel Melrose for he \nfrowned.",
    "\u201cAnything more you want to see M. Poirot\u201d he inquired brusquely.",
    "\u201cYou would perhaps be so kind as to show me the silver table from \nwhich the weapon was taken After that I will trespass on your kindness no \nlonger.\u201d \n\nWe went to the drawing room but on the way the constable waylaid the \ncolonel and after a muttered conversation the latter excused himself and \nleft us together.",
    "I showed Poirot the silver table and after raising the lid \n\n\n\nonce or twice and letting it fall he pushed open the window and stepped out \non the terrace.",
    "I followed him.",
    "Inspector Raglan had just turned the corner of the house and was \ncoming towards us.",
    "His face looked grim and satisfied.",
    "\u201cSo there you are M. Poirot\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWell this isn\u2019t going to be \nmuch of a case.",
    "I\u2019m sorry too.",
    "A nice enough young fellow gone wrong.\u201d \n\nPoirot\u2019s face fell and he spoke very mildly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I shall not be able to be of much aid to you then\u201d \n\n\u201cNext time perhaps\u201d said the inspector soothingly.",
    "\u201cThough we don\u2019t \nhave murders every day in this quiet little corner of the world.\u201d \n\nPoirot\u2019s gaze took on an admiring quality.",
    "\u201cYou have been of a marvellous promptness\u201d he observed.",
    "\u201cHow \nexactly did you go to work if I may ask\u201d \n\n\u201cCertainly\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cTo begin with\u2014method.",
    "That\u2019s what I \nalways say\u2014method\u201d \n\n\u201cAh\u201d cried the other.",
    "\u201cThat too is my watchword.",

    "\u201cThe little grey cells of the brain\u201d explained the Belgian.",
    "\u201cOh of course well we all use them I suppose.\u201d \n\n\u201cIn a greater or lesser degree\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd there are too \ndifferences in quality.",
    "Then there is the psychology of a crime.",
    "One must \nstudy that.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh\u201d said the inspector \u201cyou\u2019ve been bitten with all this psycho\u00ac \nanalysis stuff Now I\u2019m a plain man\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cMrs.",

    "Inspector Raglan a little taken aback bowed.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u201d he said grinning broadly.",
    "\u201cLord what a lot of \ndifference language makes.",
    "I\u2019m telling you how I set to work.",
    "First of all \nmethod.",
    "Mr. Ackroyd was last seen alive at a quarter to ten by his niece.",
    "Miss Flora Ackroyd.",
    "That\u2019s fact number one isn\u2019t it\u201d \n\n\u201cIf you say so.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell it is.",
    "At half past ten the doctor here says that Mr. Ackroyd had \nbeen dead at least half an hour.",
    "You stick to that doctor\u201d \n\n\u201cCertainly\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cHalf an hour or longer.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cVery good.",
    "That gives us exactly a quarter of an hour in which the \ncrime must have been committed.",
    "I make a list of everyone in the house \nand work through it setting down opposite their names where they were \nand what they were doing between the hour of 945 and 10 p.m.\u201d \n\nHe handed a sheet of paper to Poirot.",

    "The inspector laid them over the marks.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re the same\u201d he said confidently.",
    "\u201cThat is to say they\u2019re not the \nsame pair that actually made these prints.",
    "He went away in those.",
    "This is a \npair just like them but older\u2014see how the studs are worn down\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSurely a great many people wear shoes with rubber studs in them\u201d \nasked Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s so of course\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t put so much \nstress on the footmarks if it wasn\u2019t for everything else.\u201d \n\n\u201cA very foolish young man Captain Ralph Paton\u201d said Poirot \nthoughtfully.",
    "\u201cTo leave so much evidence of his presence.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh well\u201d said the inspector \u201cit was a dry fine night you know.",
    "He \nleft no prints on the terrace or on the gravelled path.",
    "But unluckily for him \na spring must have welled up just lately at the end of the path from the \ndrive.",
    "See here.\u201d \n\nA small gravelled path joined the terrace a few feet away.",
    "In one spot a \nfew yards from its termination the ground was wet and boggy.",
    "Crossing \nthis wet place there were again the marks of footsteps and amongst them \nthe shoes with rubber studs.",
    "Poirot followed the path on a little way the inspector by his side.",
    "\u201cYou noticed the women\u2019s footprints\u201d he said suddenly.",
    "The inspector laughed.",
    "\u201cNaturally.",
    "But several different women have walked this way\u2014and \nmen as well.",
    "It\u2019s a regular short cut to the house you see.",
    "It would be \nimpossible to sort out all the footsteps.",
    "After all it\u2019s the ones on the \nwindowsill that are really important.\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s no good going farther\u201d said the inspector as we came in view of \nthe drive.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all gravelled again here and hard as it can be.\u201d \n\nAgain Poirot nodded but his eyes were fixed on a small garden house\u2014 \na kind of superior summerhouse.",
    "It was a little to the left of the path ahead \nof us and a gravelled walk ran up to it.",
    "Poirot lingered about until the inspector had gone back towards the \nhouse.",
    "Then he looked at me.",
    "\u201cYou must have indeed been sent from the good God to replace my \nfriend Hastings\u201d he said with a twinkle.",
    "\u201cI observe that you do not quit my \nside.",
    "How say you.",
    "Doctor Sheppard shall we investigate that \nsummerhouse It interests me.\u201d \n\nHe went up to the door and opened it.",
    "Inside the place was almost dark.",
    "There were one or two rustic seats a croquet set and some folded deck \nchairs.",
    "I was startled to observe my new friend.",
    "He had dropped to his hands \nand knees and was crawling about the floor.",
    "Every now and then he shook \nhis head as though not satisfied.",
    "Finally he sat back on his heels.",
    "\u201cNothing\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cWell perhaps it was not to be expected.",
    "But \nit would have meant so much\u2014\u201d \n\nHe broke off stiffening all over.",
    "Then he stretched out his hand to one \nof the rustic chairs.",
    "He detached something from one side of it.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cWhat have you found\u201d \n\nHe smiled unclosing his hand so that I should see what lay in the palm \nof it.",
    "A scrap of stiff white cambric.",
    "I took it from him looked at it curiously and then handed it back.",
    "\u201cWhat do you make of it eh my friend\u201d he asked eyeing me keenly.",
    "\u201cA scrap torn from a handkerchief\u201d I suggested shrugging my \nshoulders.",
    "He made another dart and picked up a small quill\u2014a goose quill by the \nlook of it.",
    "\u201cAnd that\u201d he cried triumphantly.",
    "\u201cWhat do you make of that\u201d \n\nI only stared.",
    "He slipped the quill into his pocket and looked again at the scrap of \nwhite stuff.",
    "\u201cA fragment of a handkerchief\u201d he mused.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you are right.",
    "But \nremember this \u2014a good laundry does not starch a handkerchief.\u201d \n\nHe nodded at me triumphantly then he put away the scrap carefully in \nhis pocketbook.",
    "Nine \n\n\nTHE GOLDFISH POND \n\n\nWe walked back to the house together.",
    "There was no sign of the inspector.",
    "Poirot paused on the terrace and stood with his back to the house slowly \nturning his head from side to side.",
    "\u201cUne belle propriete\u201d he said at last appreciatively.",
    "\u201cWho inherits it\u201d \n\nHis words gave me almost a shock.",
    "It is an odd thing but until that \nmoment the question of inheritance had never come into my head.",
    "Poirot \nwatched me keenly.",
    "\u201cIt is a new idea to you that\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cYou had not thought of it \nbefore\u2014eh\u201d \n\n\u201cNo\u201d I said truthfully.",
    "\u201cI wish I had.\u201d \n\nHe looked at me again curiously.",
    "\u201cI wonder just what you mean by that\u201d he said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d \nas I was about to speak.",
    "\u201cInutile You would not tell me your real thought.\u201d \n\n\u201cEveryone has something to hide\u201d I quoted smiling.",
    "\u201cExactly.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou still believe that\u201d \n\n\u201cMore than ever my friend.",
    "But it is not easy to hide things from \nHercule Poirot.",
    "He has a knack of finding out.\u201d \n\nHe descended the steps of the Dutch garden as he spoke.",
    "\u201cLet us walk a little\u201d he said over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cThe air is pleasant \ntoday.\u201d \n\nI followed him.",
    "He led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew \nhedges.",
    "A walk led down the middle bordered each side with formal flower \nbeds and at the end was a round paved recess with a seat and a pond of \ngoldfish.",
    "Instead of pursuing the path to the end Poirot took another which \nwound up the side of a wooded slope.",
    "In one spot the trees had been cleared \naway and a seat had been put.",
    "Sitting there one had a splendid view over \n\n\n\nthe countryside and one looked right down on the paved recess and the \ngoldfish pond.",
    "\u201cEngland is very beautiful\u201d said Poirot his eyes straying over the \nprospect.",
    "Then he smiled.",
    "\u201cAnd so are English girls\u201d he said in a lower \nvoice.",
    "\u201cHush my friend and look at the pretty picture below us.\u201d \n\nIt was then that I saw Flora.",
    "She was moving along the path we had just \nleft and she was humming a little snatch of song.",
    "Her step was more \ndancing than walking and in spite of her black dress there was nothing but \njoy in her whole attitude.",
    "She gave a sudden pirouette on her toes and her \nblack draperies swung out.",
    "At the same time she flung her head back and \nlaughed outright.",
    "As she did so a man stepped out from the trees.",
    "It was Hector Blunt.",
    "The girl started.",
    "Her expression changed a little.",
    "\u201cHow you startled me\u2014I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d \n\nBlunt said nothing but stood looking at her for a minute or two in \nsilence.",
    "\u201cWhat I like about you\u201d said Flora with a touch of malice \u201cis your \ncheery conversation.\u201d \n\nI fancy that at that Blunt reddened under his tan.",
    "His voice when he \nspoke sounded different\u2014it had a curious sort of humility in it.",
    "\u201cNever was much of a fellow for talking.",
    "Not even when I was young.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat was a very long time ago I suppose\u201d said Flora gravely.",
    "I caught the undercurrent of laughter in her voice but I don\u2019t think \nBlunt did.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said simply \u201cit was.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow does it feel to be Methuselah\u201d asked Flora.",
    "This time the laughter was more apparent but Blunt was following out \nan idea of his own.",
    "\u201cRemember the johnny who sold his soul to the devil In return for \nbeing made young again There\u2019s an opera about it.\u201d \n\n\u201cFaust you mean\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beggar.",
    "Rum story.",
    "Some of us would do it if we could.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnyone would think you were creaking at the joints to hear you talk\u201d \ncried Flora half vexed half amused.",
    "Blunt said nothing for a minute or two.",
    "Then he looked away from Flora \ninto the middle distance and observed to an adjacent tree trunk that it was \nabout time he got back to Africa.",
    "\u201cAre you going on another expedition\u2014shooting things\u201d \n\n\u201cExpect so.",
    "Usually do you know\u2014shoot things I mean.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou shot that head in the hall didn\u2019t you\u201d \n\nBlunt nodded.",
    "Then he jerked out going rather red as he did so \n\n\u201cCare for some decent skins any time If so I could get \u2019em for you.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh please do\u201d cried Flora.",
    "\u201cWill you really You won\u2019t forget\u201d \n\n\u201cI shan\u2019t forget\u201d said Hector Blunt.",
    "He added in a sudden burst of communicativeness \n\n\u201cTime I went.",
    "I\u2019m no good in this sort of life.",
    "Haven\u2019t got the manners \nfor it.",
    "I\u2019m a rough fellow no use in society.",
    "Never remember the things \none\u2019s expected to say.",
    "Yes time I went.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not going at once\u201d cried Flora.",
    "\u201cNo\u2014not while we\u2019re in all \nthis trouble.",
    "Oh please.",
    "If you go\u2014\u201d \n\nShe turned away a little.",
    "\u201cYou want me to stay\u201d asked Blunt.",
    "He spoke deliberately but quite simply.",
    "\u201cWe all\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cI meant you personally\u201d said Blunt with directness.",
    "Flora turned slowly back again and met his eyes.",
    "\u201cI want you to stay\u201d she said \u201cif\u2014if that makes any difference.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt makes all the difference\u201d said Blunt.",
    "There was a moment\u2019s silence.",
    "They sat down on the stone seat by the \ngoldfish pond.",
    "It seemed as though neither of them knew quite what to say \nnext.",
    "\u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s such a lovely morning\u201d said Flora at last.",
    "\u201cYou know I can\u2019t \nhelp feeling happy in spite\u2014in spite of everything.",
    "That\u2019s awful I \nsuppose\u201d \n\n\u201cQuite natural\u201d said Blunt.",
    "\u201cNever saw your uncle until two years ago \ndid you Can\u2019t be expected to grieve very much.",
    "Much better to have no \nhumbug about it.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something awfully consoling about you\u201d said Flora.",
    "\u201cYou \nmake things seem so simple.\u201d \n\n\u201cThings are simple as a rule\u201d said the biggame hunter.",
    "\u201cNot always\u201d said Flora.",
    "Her voice had lowered itself and I saw Blunt turn and look at her \nbringing his eyes back from apparently the coast of Africa to do so.",
    "He \n\n\n\nevidently put his own construction on her change of tone for he said after a \nminute or two in rather an abrupt manner \n\n\u201cI say you know you mustn\u2019t worry.",
    "About that young chap I mean.",
    "Inspector\u2019s an ass.",
    "Everybody knows\u2014utterly absurd to think he could have \ndone it.",
    "Man from outside.",
    "Burglar chap.",
    "That\u2019s the only possible solution.\u201d \n\nFlora turned to look at him.",
    "\u201cYou really think so\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you\u201d said Blunt quickly.",
    "\u201cI\u2014oh yes of course.\u201d \n\nAnother silence and then Flora burst out \n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019ll tell you why I felt so happy this morning.",
    "However heartless \nyou think me.",
    "I\u2019d rather tell you.",
    "It\u2019s because the lawyer has been\u2014Mr.",
    "Hammond.",
    "He told us about the will.",
    "Uncle Roger has left me twenty \nthousand pounds.",
    "Think of it\u2014twenty thousand beautiful pounds.\u201d \n\nBlunt looked surprised.",
    "\u201cDoes it mean so much to you\u201d \n\n\u201cMean much to me Why it\u2019s everything.",
    "Freedom\u2014life\u2014no more \nscheming and scraping and lying\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cEying\u201d said Blunt sharply interrupting.",
    "Flora seemed taken aback for a minute.",
    "\u201cYou know what I mean\u201d she said uncertainly.",
    "\u201cPretending to be \nthankful for all the nasty castoff things rich relations give you.",
    "Fast year\u2019s \ncoat and skirts and hats.\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know much about ladies\u2019 clothes should have said you were \nalways very well turned out.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt cost me something though\u201d said Flora in a low voice.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t let\u2019s \ntalk of horrid things.",
    "I\u2019m so happy.",
    "I\u2019m free.",
    "Free to do what I like.",
    "Free not \nto\u2014\u201d \n\nShe stopped suddenly.",
    "\u201cNot to what\u201d asked Blunt quickly.",
    "\u201cI forget now.",
    "Nothing important.\u201d \n\nBlunt had a stick in his hand and he thrust it into the pond poking at \nsomething.",
    "\u201cWhat are you doing.",
    "Major Blunt\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something bright down there.",
    "Wondered what it was\u2014looks \nlike a gold brooch.",
    "Now I\u2019ve stirred up the mud and it\u2019s gone.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a crown\u201d suggested Flora.",
    "\u201cLike the one Melisande saw in \nthe water.\u201d \n\n\u201cMelisande\u201d said Blunt reflectively\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s in an opera isn\u2019t she\u201d \n\n\u201cYes you seem to know a lot about operas.\u201d \n\n\u201cPeople take me sometimes\u201d said Blunt sadly.",
    "\u201cFunny idea of pleasure \n\u2014worse racket than the natives make with their tomtoms.\u201d \n\nFlora laughed.",
    "\u201cI remember Melisande\u201d continued Blunt \u201cmarried an old chap old \nenough to be her father.\u201d \n\nHe threw a small piece of flint into the goldfish pond.",
    "Then with a \nchange of manner he turned to Flora.",
    "\u201cMiss Ackroyd can I do anything About Paton I mean.",
    "I know how \ndreadfully anxious you must be.\u201d \n\n\u201cThank you\u201d said Flora in a cold voice.",
    "\u201cThere is really nothing to be \ndone.",
    "Ralph will be all right.",
    "I\u2019ve got hold of the most wonderful detective \nin the world and he\u2019s going to find out all about it.\u201d \n\nFor some time I had felt uneasy as to our position.",
    "We were not exactly \neavesdropping since the two in the garden below had only to lift their \nheads to see us.",
    "Nevertheless I should have drawn attention to our presence \nbefore now had not my companion put a warning pressure on my arm.",
    "Clearly he wished me to remain silent.",
    "Now however he acted briskly.",
    "He rose quickly to his feet clearing his throat.",
    "\u201cI demand pardon\u201d he cried.",
    "\u201cI cannot allow mademoiselle thus \nextravagantly to compliment me and not draw attention to my presence.",
    "They say the listener hears no good of himself but that is not the case this \ntime.",
    "To spare my blushes I must join you and apologize.\u201d \n\nHe hurried down the path with me close behind him and joined the \nothers by the pond.",
    "\u201cThis is M. Hercule Poirot\u201d said Flora.",
    "\u201cI expect you\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d \n\nPoirot bowed.",
    "\u201cI know Major Blunt by reputation\u201d he said politely.",
    "\u201cI am glad to have \nencountered you monsieur.",
    "I am in need of some information that you can \ngive me.\u201d \n\nBlunt looked at him inquiringly.",
    "\u201cWhen did you last see M. Ackroyd alive\u201d \n\n\u201cAt dinner.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd you neither saw nor heard anything of him after that\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t see him.",
    "Heard his voice.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow was that\u201d \n\n\u201cI strolled out on the terrace\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cPardon me what time was that\u201d \n\n\u201cAbout half past nine.",
    "I was walking up and down smoking in front of \nthe drawing room window.",
    "I heard Ackroyd talking in his study\u2014\u201d \n\nPoirot stopped and removed a microscopic weed.",
    "\u201cSurely you couldn\u2019t hear voices in the study from that part of the \nterrace\u201d he murmured.",
    "He was not looking at Blunt but I was and to my intense surprise I \nsaw the latter flush.",
    "\u201cWent as far as the corner\u201d he explained unwillingly.",
    "\u201cAh indeed\u201d said Poirot.",
    "In the mildest manner he conveyed an impression that more was \nwanted.",
    "\u201cThought I saw\u2014a woman disappearing into the bushes.",
    "Just a gleam of \nwhite you know.",
    "Must have been mistaken.",
    "It was while I was standing at \nthe corner of the terrace that I heard Ackroyd\u2019s voice speaking to that \nsecretary of his.\u201d \n\n\u201cSpeaking to Mr. Geoffrey Raymond\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u2014that\u2019s what I supposed at the time.",
    "Seems I was wrong.\u201d \n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Ackroyd didn\u2019t address him by name\u201d \n\n\u201cOh no.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen if I may ask why did you think\u2014\u201d \n\nBlunt explained laboriously.",
    "\u201cTook it for granted that it would be Raymond because he had said just \nbefore I came out that he was taking some papers to Ackroyd.",
    "Never \nthought of it being anybody else.\u201d \n\n\u201cCan you remember what the words you heard were\u201d \n\n\u201cAfraid I can\u2019t.",
    "Something quite ordinary and unimportant.",
    "Only caught \na scrap of it.",
    "I was thinking of something else at the time.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is of no importance\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cDid you move a chair back \nagainst the wall when you went into the study after the body was \ndiscovered\u201d \n\n\u201cChair No why should I\u201d \n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders but did not answer.",
    "He turned to Flora.",

    "Flora stamped her foot.",
    "\u201cYou too Dr. Sheppard Oh it\u2019s too bad.\u201d \n\nPoirot tactfully made a diversion.",
    "\u201cIt is true what I heard you say.",
    "Major Blunt.",
    "There is something that \nglitters in this pond.",
    "Let us see if I can reach it.\u201d \n\nHe knelt down by the pond baring his arm to the elbow and lowered it \nin very slowly so as not to disturb the bottom of the pond.",
    "But in spite of all \nhis precautions the mud eddied and swirled and he was forced to draw his \narm out again emptyhanded.",

    "He had \nentrusted the job to me.",
    "Why Was it because as in the case of questioning \nMajor Blunt he wished to remain in the background The wish intelligible \nin the first case seemed to me quite meaningless here.",

    "\u201cYes\u201d I said.",

    "I assure you I don\u2019t.",
    "Why should I \nIt\u2014it just seemed a little odd you know.",
    "That\u2019s all.",
    "A little odd.\u201d \n\nOne advantage of being a medical practitioner is that you can usually \ntell when people are lying to you.",
    "I should have known from Mrs. Folliott\u2019s \nmanner if from nothing else that she did mind answering my questions\u2014 \nminded intensely.",
    "She was thoroughly uncomfortable and upset and there \nwas plainly some mystery in the background.",
    "I judged her to be a woman \nquite unused to deception of any kind and consequently rendered acutely \nuneasy when forced to practise it.",
    "A child could have seen through her.",

    "Caroline was sitting beside the wreck of tea things.",
    "She had that look of \nsuppressed exultation on her face which I know only too well.",
    "It is a sure \nsign with her of either the getting or the giving of information.",

    "\u201cTo see me of course.",
    "He said that knowing my brother so well he \nhoped he might be permitted to make the acquaintance of his charming \nsister\u2014your charming sister I\u2019ve got mixed up\u2014but you know what I \nmean.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat did he talk about\u201d I asked.",

    "It would be\u2014to Caroline.",
    "I could not but admire the ingenuity of M. \nHercule Poirot who had selected unerringly the case of all others that \nwould most appeal to an elderly lady living in a small village.",

    "\u201cAnd after all this\u201d I remarked \u201cI suppose you were ready to eat out of \nhis hand\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be coarse James.",
    "I don\u2019t know where you get these vulgar \nexpressions from.\u201d \n\n\u201cProbably from my only link with the outside world\u2014my patients.",
    "Unfortunately my practice does not lie amongst Royal princes and \ninteresting Russian emigres.\u201d \n\nCaroline pushed her spectacles up and looked at me.",
    "\u201cYou seem very grumpy James.",
    "It must be your liver.",
    "A blue pill I \nthink tonight.\u201d \n\nTo see me in my own home you would never imagine that I was a \ndoctor of medicine.",

    "How do I know that that \nis so\u201d \n\n\u201cI told you so\u201d I began again but Poirot interrupted me with a gesture \nof impatience.",
    "\u201cAh but it is that you are a little stupid tonight my friend.",
    "You know \nthat it is so\u2014but how am I to know Eh bien I am able to tell you that the \nMysterious Stranger was not a hallucination on your part because the maid \nof a Miss Gannett met him a few minutes before you did and of her too he \ninquired the way to Fernly Park.",
    "We accept his presence therefore and we \ncan be fairly sure of two things about him\u2014that he was a stranger to the \nneighbourhood and that whatever his object in going to Fernly there was \nno great secrecy about it since he twice asked the way there.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u201d I said \u201cI see that.\u201d \n\n\u201cNow I have made it my business to find out more about this man.",
    "He \nhad a drink at the Three Boars I learn and the barmaid there says that he \nspoke with an American accent and mentioned having just come over from \nthe States.",
    "Did it strike you that he had an American accent\u201d \n\n\u201cYes I think he had\u201d I said after a minute or two during which I cast \nmy mind back \u201cbut a very slight one.\u201d \n\n\u201cPrecisement.",
    "There is also this which you will remember I picked up \nin the summerhouse.\u201d \n\nHe held out to me the little quill.",
    "I looked at it curiously.",
    "Then a \nmemory of something I had read stirred in me.",
    "Poirot who had been watching my face nodded.",
    "\u201cYes heroin \u2018snow\u2019.",
    "Drugtakers carry it like this and sniff it up the \nnose.\u201d \n\n\u201cDiamorphine hydrochloride\u201d I murmured mechanically.",
    "\u201cThis method of taking the drug is very common on the other side.",
    "Another proof if we wanted one that the man came from Canada or the \nStates.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat first attracted your attention to that summerhouse\u201d I asked \ncuriously.",
    "\u201cMy friend the inspector took it for granted that anyone using that path \ndid so as a short cut to the house but as soon as I saw the summerhouse I \nrealized that the same path would be taken by anyone using the \nsummerhouse as a rendezvous.",
    "Now it seems fairly certain that the stranger \ncame neither to the front nor to the back door.",
    "Then did someone from the \nhouse go out and meet him If so what could be a more convenient place \nthan that little summerhouse I searched it with the hope that I might find \nsome clue inside.",
    "I found two the scrap of cambric and the quill.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd the scrap of cambric\u201d I asked curiously.",
    "\u201cWhat about that\u201d \n\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.",
    "\u201cYou do not use your little grey cells\u201d he remarked drily.",
    "\u201cThe scrap of \nstarched cambric should be obvious.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot very obvious to me.\u201d I changed the subject.",
    "\u201cAnyway\u201d I said \n\u201cthis man went to the summerhouse to meet somebody.",
    "Who was that \nsomebody\u201d \n\n\u201cExactly the question\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou will remember that Mrs. \nAckroyd and her daughter came over from Canada to live here\u201d \n\n\u201cIs that what you meant today when you accused them of hiding the \ntruth\u201d \n\n\u201cPerhaps.",
    "Now another point.",
    "What did you think of the parlourmaid\u2019s \nstory\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat story\u201d \n\n\u201cThe story of her dismissal.",
    "Does it take half an hour to dismiss a \nservant Was the story of those important papers a likely one And \nremember though she says she was in her bedroom from ninethirty until \nten o\u2019clock there is no one to confirm her statement.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou bewilder me\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cTo me it grows clearer.",
    "But tell me now your own ideas and theories.\u201d \n\nI drew a piece of paper from my pocket.",
    "\u201cI just scribbled down a few suggestions\u201d I said apologetically.",
    "\u201cBut excellent\u2014you have method.",
    "Let us hear them.\u201d \n\nI read out in a somewhat embarrassed voice.",
    "\u201cTo begin with one must look at the thing logically\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cJust what my poor Hastings used to say\u201d interrupted Poirot \u201cbut alas \nhe never did so.\u201d \n\n\u201cPoint No.",

    "We know Ralph Paton was in a scrape.",
    "\u201cThese four points go to show that the person with Mr. Ackroyd at nine \nthirty was Ralph Paton.",
    "But we know that Mr. Ackroyd was alive at a \nquarter to ten therefore it was not Ralph who killed him.",
    "Ralph left the \nwindow open.",
    "Afterwards the murderer came in that way.",
    "\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd who was the murderer\u201d inquired Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe American stranger.",
    "He may have been in league with Parker and \npossibly in Parker we have the man who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars.",
    "If so \nParker may have heard enough to realize the game was up have told his \naccomplice so and the latter did the crime with the dagger which Parker \ngave him.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is a theory that\u201d admitted Poirot.",
    "\u201cDecidedly you have cells of a \nkind.",
    "But it leaves a good deal unaccounted for.\u201d \n\n\u201cSuch as\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cThe telephone call the pushedout chair\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you really think that latter important\u201d I interrupted.",

    "Tell me instead what were \nRalph Paton\u2019s reasons for disappearing\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather more difficult\u201d I said slowly.",

    "Men have been known to do that\u2014act guiltily when \nthey\u2019re perfectly innocent.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes that is true\u201d said Poirot.",

    "Ralph Paton \ninherits a great fortune by his uncle\u2019s death.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is one motive\u201d agreed Poirot.",
    "\u201cOne\u201d \n\n\u201cMais oui.",
    "Do you realize that there are three separate motives staring \nus in the face.",
    "Somebody certainly stole the blue envelope and its contents.",
    "That is one motive.",
    "Blackmail Ralph Paton may have been the man who \nblackmailed Mrs. Ferrars.",
    "Remember as far as Hammond knew Ralph \nPaton had not applied to his uncle for help of late.",
    "That looks as though he \nwere being supplied with money elsewhere.",
    "Then there is the fact that he \nwas in some\u2014how do you say\u2014scrape\u2014which he feared might get to his \nuncle\u2019s ears.",
    "And finally there is the one you have just mentioned.\u201d \n\n\u201cDear me\u201d I said rather taken aback.",
    "\u201cThe case does seem black \nagainst him.\u201d \n\n\u201cDoes it\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat is where we disagree you and I.",

    "The whole thing can be divided into two parts \neach clear and distinct from the other.",
    "Part I ranges from Ackroyd\u2019s death \non the Friday evening to the following Monday night.",
    "It is the \nstraightforward narrative of what occurred as presented to Hercule Poirot.",
    "I \nwas at Poirot\u2019s elbow the whole time.",
    "I saw what he saw.",
    "I tried my best to \nread his mind.",
    "As I know now I failed in this latter task.",
    "Though Poirot \nshowed me all his discoveries\u2014as for instance the gold weddingring\u2014he \nheld back the vital and yet logical impressions that he formed.",
    "As I came to \nknow later this secrecy was characteristic of him.",
    "He would throw out hints \nand suggestions but beyond that he would not go.",
    "As I say up till the Monday evening my narrative might have been that \nof Poirot himself.",
    "I played Watson to his Sherlock.",
    "But after Monday our \nways diverged.",
    "Poirot was busy on his own account.",
    "I got to hear of what he \nwas doing because in King\u2019s Abbot you get to hear of everything but he \ndid not take me into his confidence beforehand.",
    "And I too had my own \npreoccupations.",
    "On looking back the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal \ncharacter of this period.",
    "Everyone had a hand in the elucidation of the \nmystery.",
    "It was rather like a jigsaw puzzle to which everyone contributed \ntheir own little piece of knowledge or discovery.",
    "But their task ended there.",
    "To Poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those pieces into their correct \nplace.",
    "Some of the incidents seemed at the time irrelevant and unmeaning.",
    "There was for instance the question of the black boots.",
    "But that comes \nlater.... To take things strictly in chronological order I must begin with the \nsummons from Mrs. Ackroyd.",
    "She sent for me early on Tuesday morning and since the summons \nsounded an urgent one I hastened there expecting to find her in extremis.",
    "The lady was in bed.",
    "So much did she concede to the etiquette of the \nsituation.",
    "She gave me her bony hand and indicated a chair drawn up to the \nbedside.",
    "\u201cWell Mrs. Ackroyd\u201d I said \u201cand what\u2019s the matter with you\u201d \n\nI spoke with that kind of spurious geniality which seems to be expected \nof general practitioners.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m prostrated\u201d said Mrs. Ackroyd in a faint voice.",
    "\u201cAbsolutely \nprostrated.",
    "It\u2019s the shock of poor Roger\u2019s death.",
    "They say these things often \naren\u2019t felt at the time you know.",
    "It\u2019s the reaction afterwards.\u201d \n\nIt is a pity that a doctor is precluded by his profession from being able \nsometimes to say what he really thinks.",
    "I would have given anything to be able to answer \u201cBunkum\u201d \n\nInstead I suggested a tonic.",
    "Mrs. Ackroyd accepted the tonic.",
    "One \nmove in the game seemed now to be concluded.",
    "Not for a moment did I \nimagine that I had been sent for because of the shock occasioned by \nAckroyd\u2019s death.",
    "But Mrs. Ackroyd is totally incapable of pursuing a \nstraightforward course on any subject.",
    "She always approaches her object by \ntortuous means.",
    "I wondered very much why it was she had sent for me.",
    "\u201cAnd then that scene\u2014yesterday\u201d continued my patient.",
    "She paused as though expecting me to take up a cue.",
    "\u201cWhat scene\u201d \n\n\u201cDoctor how can you Have you forgotten That dreadful little \nFrenchman\u2014or Belgian\u2014or whatever he is.",
    "Bullying us all like he did.",
    "It \nhas quite upset me.",
    "Coming on the top of Roger\u2019s death.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry Mrs. Ackroyd\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know what he meant\u2014shouting at us like he did.",
    "I should hope \nI know my duty too well to dream of concealing anything.",
    "I have given the \npolice every assistance in my power.\u201d \n\nMrs. Ackroyd paused and I said \u201cQuite so.\u201d I was beginning to have a \nglimmering of what all the trouble was about.",
    "\u201cNo one can say that I have failed in my duty\u201d continued Mrs. \n\nAckroyd.",
    "\u201cI am sure Inspector Raglan is perfectly satisfied.",
    "Why should \nthis little upstart of a foreigner make a fuss A most ridiculouslooking \ncreature he is too\u2014just like a comic Frenchman in a revue.",
    "I can\u2019t think \nwhy Flora insisted on bringing him into the case.",
    "She never said a word to \n\n\n\nme about it.",
    "Just went off and did it on her own.",
    "Flora is too independent.",
    "I \nam a woman of the world and her mother.",
    "She should have come to me for \nadvice first.\u201d \n\nI listened to all this in silence.",
    "\u201cWhat does he think That\u2019s what I want to know.",
    "Does he actually \nimagine I\u2019m hiding something He\u2014he\u2014positively accused me \nyesterday.\u201d \n\nI shrugged my shoulders.",
    "\u201cIt is surely of no consequence Mrs. Ackroyd\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cSince you are \nnot concealing anything any remarks he may have made do not apply to \nyou.\u201d \n\nMrs. Ackroyd went off at a tangent after her usual fashion.",
    "\u201cServants are so tiresome\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cThey gossip and talk amongst \nthemselves.",
    "And then it gets round\u2014and all the time there\u2019s probably \nnothing in it at all.\u201d \n\n\u201cHave the servants been talking\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cWhat about\u201d \n\nMrs. Ackroyd cast a very shrewd glance at me.",
    "It quite threw me off my \nbalance.",
    "\u201cI was sure you \u2019d know doctor if anyone did.",
    "You were with M. Poirot \nall the time weren\u2019t you\u201d \n\n\u201cI was.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen of course you know.",
    "It was that girl Ursula Bourne wasn\u2019t it \nNaturally\u2014she\u2019s leaving.",
    "She would want to make all the trouble she could.",
    "Spiteful that\u2019s what they are.",
    "They\u2019re all alike.",
    "Now you being there \ndoctor you must know exactly what she did say I\u2019m most anxious that no \nwrong impression should get about.",
    "After all you don\u2019t repeat every little \ndetail to the police do you There are family matters sometimes\u2014nothing \nto do with the question of the murder.",
    "But if the girl was spiteful she may \nhave made out all sorts of things.\u201d \n\nI was shrewd enough to see that a very real anxiety lay behind these \noutpourings.",
    "Poirot had been justified in his premises.",
    "Of the six people \nround the table yesterday Mrs. Ackroyd at least had had something to hide.",
    "It was for me to discover what that something might be.",
    "\u201cIf I were you Mrs. Ackroyd\u201d I said brusquely \u201cI should make a clean \nbreast of things.\u201d \n\nShe gave a little scream.",
    "\u201cOh doctor how can you be so abrupt.",
    "It sounds as though\u2014as though \n\u2014And I can explain everything so simply.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen why not do so\u201d I suggested.",
    "Mrs. Ackroyd took out a frilled handkerchief and became tearful.",
    "\u201cI thought doctor that you might put it to M. Poirot\u2014explain it you \nknow\u2014because it\u2019s so difficult for a foreigner to see our point of view.",
    "And \nyou don\u2019t know\u2014nobody could know\u2014what I\u2019ve had to contend with.",
    "A \nmartyrdom\u2014a long martyrdom.",
    "That\u2019s what my life has been.",
    "I don\u2019t like \nto speak ill of the dead\u2014but there it is.",
    "Not the smallest bill but it had all to \nbe gone over\u2014just as though Roger had had a few miserly hundreds a year \ninstead of being as Mr. Hammond told me yesterday one of the wealthiest \nmen in these parts.\u201d \n\nMrs. Ackroyd paused to dab her eyes with the frilled handkerchief.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d I said encouragingly.",
    "\u201cYou were talking about bills\u201d \n\n\u201cThose dreadful bills.",
    "And some I didn\u2019t like to show Roger at all.",
    "They \nwere things a man wouldn\u2019t understand.",
    "He would have said the things \nweren\u2019t necessary.",
    "And of course they mounted up you know and they \nkept coming in\u2014\u201d \n\nShe looked at me appealingly as though asking me to condole with her \non this striking peculiarity.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a habit they have\u201d I agreed.",
    "And the tone altered\u2014became quite abusive.",
    "\u201cI assure you doctor I \nwas becoming a nervous wreck.",
    "I couldn\u2019t sleep at nights.",
    "And a dreadful \nfluttering round the heart.",
    "And then I got a letter from a Scotch gentleman \n\u2014as a matter of fact there were two letters\u2014both Scotch gentlemen.",
    "Mr. \nBruce MacPherson was one and the other was Colin MacDonald.",
    "Quite a \ncoincidence.\u201d \n\n\u201cHardly that\u201d I said drily.",
    "\u201cThey are usually Scotch gentlemen but I \nsuspect a Semitic strain in their ancestry.\u201d \n\n\u201cTen pounds to ten thousand on note of hand alone\u201d murmured Mrs. \nAckroyd reminiscently.",
    "\u201cI wrote to one of them but it seemed there were \ndifficulties.\u201d \n\nShe paused.",
    "I gathered that we were just coming to delicate ground.",
    "I have never \nknown anyone more difficult to bring to the point.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d murmured Mrs. Ackroyd \u201cit\u2019s all a question of expectations \nisn\u2019t it Testamentary expectations.",
    "And though of course I expected that \n\n\n\nRoger would provide for me I didn\u2019t know.",
    "I thought that if only I could \nglance over a copy of his will\u2014not in any sense of vulgar prying\u2014but just \nso that I could make my own arrangements.\u201d \n\nShe glanced sideways at me.",
    "The position was now very delicate \nindeed.",
    "Fortunately words ingeniously used will serve to mask the ugliness \nof naked facts.",
    "\u201cI could only tell this to you dear Doctor Sheppard\u201d said Mrs. Ackroyd \nrapidly.",
    "\u201cI can trust you not to misjudge me and to represent the matter in \nthe right light to M. Poirot.",
    "It was on Friday afternoon\u2014\u201d \n\nShe came to a stop and swallowed uncertainly.",

    "\u201cOn Friday afternoon.",
    "Well\u201d \n\n\u201cEveryone was out or so I thought.",
    "And I went into Roger\u2019s study\u2014I \nhad some real reason for going there\u2014I mean there was nothing underhand \nabout it.",
    "And as I saw all the papers heaped on the desk it just came to me \nlike a flash T wonder if Roger keeps his will in one of the drawers of the \ndesk.\u2019 I\u2019m so impulsive always was from a child.",
    "I do things on the spur of \nthe moment.",
    "He\u2019d left his keys\u2014very careless of him\u2014in the lock of the \ntop drawer.\u201d \n\n\u201cI see\u201d I said helpfully.",
    "\u201cSo you searched the desk.",
    "Did you find the \nwill\u201d \n\nMrs. Ackroyd gave a little scream and I realized that I had not been \nsufficiently diplomatic.",
    "\u201cHow dreadful it sounds.",
    "But it wasn\u2019t at all like that really.\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t\u201d I said hastily.",
    "\u201cYou must forgive my unfortunate \nway of putting things.\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course men are so peculiar.",
    "In dear Roger\u2019s place I should have \nnot objected to revealing the provisions of my will.",
    "But men are so \nsecretive.",
    "One is forced to adopt little subterfuges in selfdefence.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd the result of the little subterfuge\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s just what I\u2019m telling you.",
    "As I got to the bottom drawer Bourne \ncame in.",
    "Most awkward.",
    "Of course I shut the drawer and stood up and I \ncalled her attention to a few specks of dust on the surface.",
    "But I didn\u2019t like \nthe way she looked\u2014quite respectful in manner but a very nasty light in \nher eyes.",
    "Almost contemptuous if you know what I mean.",
    "I never have \nliked that girl very much.",
    "She\u2019s a good servant and she says Ma\u2019am and \ndoesn\u2019t object to wearing caps and aprons which I declare to you a lot of \nthem do nowadays and she can say \u2018Not at home\u2019 without scruples if she \n\n\n\nhas to answer the door instead of Parker and she doesn\u2019t have those \npeculiar gurgling noises inside which so many parlourmaids seem to have \nwhen they wait at table\u2014Let me see where was I\u201d \n\n\u201cYou were saying that in spite of several valuable qualities you never \nliked Bourne.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo more I do.",
    "She\u2019s\u2014odd.",
    "There\u2019s something different about her from \nthe others.",
    "Too well educated that\u2019s my opinion.",
    "You can\u2019t tell who are \nladies and who aren\u2019t nowadays.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd what happened next\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cNothing.",
    "At last Roger came in.",
    "And I thought he was out for a walk.",
    "And he said \u2018What\u2019s all this\u2019 and I said \u2018Nothing.",

    "Bourne stayed behind.",
    "I \nheard her asking Roger if she could speak to him for a minute.",

    "I was very upset.\u201d \n\nThere was a pause.",
    "\u201cYou will explain to M. Poirot won\u2019t you You can see for yourself \nwhat a trivial matter the whole thing was.",
    "But of course when he was so \nstern about concealing things I thought of this at once.",
    "Bourne may have \nmade some extraordinary story out of it but you can explain can\u2019t you\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is all\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cYou have told me everything\u201d \n\n\u201cYees\u201d said Mrs. Ackroyd.",
    "\u201cOh yes\u201d she added firmly.",
    "But I had noted the momentary hesitation and I knew that there was \nstill something she was keeping back.",
    "It was nothing less than a flash of \nsheer genius that prompted me to ask the question I did.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Ackroyd\u201d I said \u201cwas it you who left the silver table open\u201d \n\nI had my answer in the blush of guilt that even rouge and powder could \nnot conceal.",
    "\u201cHow did you know\u201d she whispered.",
    "\u201cIt was you then\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u2014I\u2014you see\u2014there were one or two pieces of old silver\u2014very \ninteresting.",
    "I had been reading up the subject and there was an illustration \nof quite a small piece which had fetched an immense sum at Christy\u2019s.",
    "It \nlooked to be just the same as the one in the silver table.",
    "I thought I would \ntake it up to London with me when I went\u2014and\u2014and have it valued.",
    "Then \nif it really was a valuable piece just think what a charming surprise it \nwould have been for Roger.\u201d \n\n\n\nI refrained from comments accepting Mrs. Ackroyd\u2019s story on its \nmerits.",
    "I even forbore to ask her why it was necessary to abstract what she \nwanted in such a surreptitious manner.",
    "\u201cWhy did you leave the lid open\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cDid you forget\u201d \n\n\u201cI was startled\u201d said Mrs. Ackroyd.",
    "\u201cI heard footsteps coming along the \nterrace outside.",
    "I hastened out of the room and just got up the stairs before \nParker opened the front door to you.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat must have been Miss Russell\u201d I said thoughtfully.",
    "Mrs. Ackroyd \nhad revealed to me one fact that was extremely interesting.",
    "Whether her \ndesigns upon Ackroyd\u2019s silver had been strictly honourable I neither knew \nnor cared.",
    "What did interest me was the fact that Miss Russell must have \nentered the drawing room by the window and that I had not been wrong \nwhen I judged her to be out of breath with running.",
    "Where had she been I \nthought of the summerhouse and the scrap of cambric.",
    "\u201cI wonder if Miss Russell has had her handkerchiefs starched\u201d I \nexclaimed on the spur of the moment.",
    "Mrs. Ackroyd\u2019s start recalled me to myself and I rose.",
    "\u201cYou think you can explain to M. Poirot\u201d she asked anxiously.",
    "\u201cOh certainly.",
    "Absolutely.\u201d \n\nI got away at last after being forced to listen to more justifications of \nher conduct.",
    "The parlourmaid was in the hall and it was she who helped me on with \nmy overcoat.",
    "I observed her more closely than I had done heretofore.",
    "It was \nclear that she had been crying.",
    "\u201cHow is it\u201d I asked \u201cthat you told us that Mr. Ackroyd sent for you on \nFriday to his study I hear now that it was you who asked to speak to him.\u201d \n\nFor a minute the girl\u2019s eyes dropped before mine.",
    "Then she spoke.",
    "\u201cI meant to leave in any case\u201d she said uncertainly.",
    "I said no more.",
    "She opened the front door for me.",
    "Just as I was passing \nout she said suddenly in a low voice \n\n\u201cExcuse me sir is there any news of Captain Paton\u201d \n\nI shook my head looking at her inquiringly.",
    "\u201cHe ought to come back\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIndeed\u2014indeed he ought to come \nback.\u201d \n\nShe was looking at me with appealing eyes.",
    "\u201cDoes no one know where he is\u201d she asked.",
    "\u201cDo you\u201d I said sharply.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "\u201cNo indeed.",
    "I know nothing.",
    "But anyone who was a friend to him \nwould tell him this he ought to come back.\u201d \n\nI lingered thinking that perhaps the girl would say more.",
    "Her next \nquestion surprised me.",
    "\u201cWhen do they think the murder was done Just before ten o\u2019clock\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is the idea\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cBetween a quarter to ten and the hour.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot earlier Not before a quarter to ten\u201d \n\nI looked at her attentively.",
    "She was so clearly eager for a reply in the \naffirmative.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s out of the question\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cMiss Ackroyd saw her uncle alive \nat a quarter to ten.\u201d \n\nShe turned away and her whole figure seemed to droop.",
    "\u201cA handsome girl\u201d I said to myself as I drove off.",
    "\u201cAn exceedingly \nhandsome girl.\u201d \n\nCaroline was at home.",
    "She had had a visit from Poirot and was very \npleased and important about it.",
    "\u201cI am helping him with the case\u201d she explained.",
    "I felt rather uneasy.",
    "Caroline is bad enough as it is.",
    "What will she be \nlike with her detective instincts encouraged \n\n\u201cAre you going round the neighbourhood looking for Ralph Paton\u2019s \nmysterious girl\u201d I inquired.",
    "\u201cI might do that on my own account\u201d said Caroline.",
    "\u201cNo this is a \nspecial thing M. Poirot wants me to find out for him.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat is it\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cHe wants to know whether Ralph Paton\u2019s boots were black or brown\u201d \nsaid Caroline with tremendous solemnity.",
    "I stared at her.",
    "I see now that I was unbelievably stupid about these \nboots.",
    "I failed altogether to grasp the point.",
    "\u201cThey were brown shoes\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI saw them.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot shoes James boots.",
    "M. Poirot wants to know whether a pair of \nboots Ralph had with him at the hotel were brown or black.",
    "A lot hangs on \nit.\u201d \n\nCall me dense if you like.",
    "I didn\u2019t see.",
    "\u201cAnd how are you going to find out\u201d I asked.",
    "Caroline said there would be no difficulty about that.",
    "Our Annie\u2019s \ndearest friend was Miss Gannett\u2019s maid Clara.",
    "And Clara was walking out \nwith the Boots at the Three Boars.",
    "The whole thing was simplicity itself \nand by the aid of Miss Gannett who cooperated loyally at once giving \nClara leave of absence the matter was rushed through at express speed.",
    "It was when we were sitting down to lunch that Caroline remarked with \nwouldbe unconcern \n\n\u201cAbout those boots of Ralph Paton\u2019s.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell\u201d I said \u201cwhat about them\u201d \n\n\u201cM.",
    "Poirot thought they were probably brown.",
    "He was wrong.",
    "They\u2019re \nblack.\u201d \n\nAnd Caroline nodded her head several times.",
    "She evidently felt that she \nhad scored a point over Poirot.",
    "I did not answer.",
    "I was puzzling over what the colour of a pair of Ralph \nPaton\u2019s boots had to do with the case.",
    "Fifteen \n\n\nGEOFFREY RAYMOND \n\n\nI was to have a further proof that day of the success of Poirot\u2019s tactics.",
    "That \nchallenge of his had been a subtle touch born of his knowledge of human \nnature.",
    "A mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the truth from Mrs. Ackroyd.",
    "She was the first to react.",
    "That afternoon when I returned from seeing my patients Caroline told \nme that Geoffrey Raymond had just left.",
    "\u201cDid he want to see me\u201d I asked as I hung up my coat in the hall.",

    "M. Poirot was out.",
    "Mr. Raymond thought that he might be \nhere or that you might know where he was.\u201d \n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea.\u201d \n\n\u201cI tried to make him wait\u201d said Caroline \u201cbut he said he would call \nback at The Larches in half an hour and went away down the village.",
    "A \ngreat pity because M. Poirot came in practically the minute after he left.\u201d \n\n\u201cCame in here\u201d \n\n\u201cNo to his own house.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow do you know\u201d \n\n\u201cThe side window\u201d said Caroline briefly.",
    "It seemed to me that we had now exhausted the topic.",

    "\u201cAren\u2019t you going across\u201d \n\n\u201cAcross where\u201d \n\n\u201cTo The Larches of course.\u201d \n\n\u201cMy dear Caroline\u201d I said \u201cwhat for\u201d \n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Raymond wanted to see him very particularly\u201d said Caroline.",
    "\u201cYou might hear what it\u2019s all about.\u201d \n\nI raised my eyebrows.",
    "\u201cCuriosity is not my besetting sin\u201d I remarked coldly.",
    "\u201cI can exist \ncomfortably without knowing exactly what my neighbours are doing and \nthinking.\u201d \n\n\u201cStuff and nonsense James\u201d said my sister.",
    "\u201cYou want to know just as \nmuch as I do.",
    "You\u2019re not so honest that\u2019s all.",
    "You always have to pretend.\u201d \n\n\u201cReally Caroline\u201d I said and retired into my surgery.",
    "Ten minutes later Caroline tapped at the door and entered.",
    "In her hand \nshe held what seemed to be a pot of jam.",
    "\u201cI wonder James\u201d she said \u201cif you would mind taking this pot of \nmedlar jelly across to M. Poirot I promised it to him.",
    "He has never tasted \nany homemade medlar jelly.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t Annie go\u201d I asked coldly.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s doing some mending.",
    "I can\u2019t spare her.\u201d \n\nCaroline and I looked at each other.",
    "\u201cVery well\u201d I said rising.",
    "\u201cBut if I take the beastly thing I shall just \nleave it at the door.",
    "You understand that\u201d \n\nMy sister raised her eyebrows.",
    "\u201cNaturally\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cWho suggested you should do anything else\u201d \n\nThe honours were with Caroline.",
    "\u201cIf you do happen to see M. Poirot\u201d she said as I opened the front \ndoor \u201cyou might tell him about the boots.\u201d \n\nIt was a most subtle parting shot.",
    "I wanted dreadfully to understand the \nenigma of the boots.",
    "When the old lady with the Breton cap opened the \ndoor to me I found myself asking if M. Poirot was in quite automatically.",
    "Poirot sprang up to meet me with every appearance of pleasure.",
    "\u201cSit down my good friend\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe big chair This small one \nThe room is not too hot no\u201d \n\nI thought it was stifling but refrained from saying so.",
    "The windows \nwere closed and a large fire burned in the grate.",
    "\u201cThe English people they have a mania for the fresh air\u201d declared \nPoirot.",
    "\u201cThe big air it is all very well outside where it belongs.",
    "Why admit \nit to the house But let us not discuss such banalities.",
    "You have something \nfor me yes\u201d \n\n\u201cTwo things\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cFirst\u2014this\u2014from my sister.\u201d \n\nI handed over the pot of medlar jelly.",
    "\u201cHow kind of Mademoiselle Caroline.",
    "She has remembered her \npromise.",
    "And the second thing\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cInformation\u2014of a kind.\u201d \n\nAnd I told him of my interview with Mrs. Ackroyd.",
    "He listened with \ninterest but not much excitement.",
    "\u201cIt clears the ground\u201d he said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cAnd it has a certain value \nas confirming the evidence of the housekeeper.",
    "She said you remember \nthat she found the silver table lid open and closed it down in passing.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat about her statement that she went into the drawing room to see if \nthe flowers were fresh\u201d \n\n\u201cAh we never took that very seriously did we my friend It was \npatently an excuse trumped up in a hurry by a woman who felt it urgent to \nexplain her presence\u2014which by the way you would probably never have \nthought of questioning.",
    "I considered it possible that her agitation might \narise from the fact that she had been tampering with the silver table but I \nthink now that we must look for another cause.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWhom did she go out to meet And why\u201d \n\n\u201cYou think she went to meet someone\u201d \n\n\u201cI do.\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cSo do I\u201d he said thoughtfully.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "\u201cBy the way\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019ve got a message for you from my sister.",
    "Ralph \nPaton\u2019s boots were black not brown.\u201d \n\nI was watching him closely as I gave the message and I fancied that I \nsaw a momentary flicker of discomposure.",
    "If so it passed almost \nimmediately.",
    "\u201cShe is absolutely positive they are not brown\u201d \n\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot regretfully.",
    "\u201cThat is a pity.\u201d \n\nAnd he seemed quite crestfallen.",
    "He entered into no explanations but at once started a new subject of \nconversation.",
    "\u201cThe housekeeper.",
    "Miss Russell who came to consult you on that \nFriday morning\u2014is it indiscreet to ask what passed at the interview\u2014apart \nfrom the medical details I mean\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWhen the professional part of the conversation was \nover we talked for a few minutes about poisons and the ease or difficulty \nof detecting them and about drugtaking and drugtakers.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWith special reference to cocaine\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cHow did you know\u201d I asked somewhat surprised.",
    "For answer the little man rose and crossed the room to where \nnewspapers were filed.",
    "He brought me a copy of the Daily Budget dated \nFriday 16th September and showed me an article dealing with the \nsmuggling of cocaine.",
    "It was a somewhat lurid article written with an eye \nto picturesque effect.",
    "\u201cThat is what put cocaine into her head my friend\u201d he said.",
    "I would have catechized him further for I did not quite understand his \nmeaning but at that moment the door opened and Geoffrey Raymond was \nannounced.",
    "He came in fresh and debonair as ever and greeted us both.",
    "\u201cHow are you doctor M. Poirot this is the second time I\u2019ve been here \nthis morning.",
    "I was anxious to catch you.\u201d \n\n\u201cPerhaps I\u2019d better be off\u201d I suggested rather awkwardly.",
    "\u201cNot on my account doctor.",
    "No it\u2019s just this\u201d he went on seating \nhimself at a wave of invitation from Poirot \u201cI\u2019ve got a confession to make.\u201d \n\n\u201cEn verite\u201d said Poirot with an air of polite interest.",
    "\u201cOh it\u2019s of no consequence really.",
    "But as a matter of fact my \nconscience has been pricking me ever since yesterday afternoon.",
    "You \naccused us all of keeping back something M. Poirot.",
    "I plead guilty.",
    "I\u2019ve had \nsomething up my sleeve.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd what is that M. Raymond\u201d \n\n\u201cAs I say it\u2019s nothing of consequence\u2014just this.",
    "I was in debt\u2014badly \nand that legacy came in the nick of time.",
    "Five hundred pounds puts me on \nmy feet again with a little to spare.\u201d \n\nHe smiled at us both with that engaging frankness that made him such a \nlikeable youngster.",
    "\u201cYou know how it is.",
    "Suspiciouslooking policemen\u2014don\u2019t like to \nadmit you were hard up for money\u2014think it will look bad to them.",
    "But I \nwas a fool really because Blunt and I were in the billiard room from a \nquarter to ten onwards so I\u2019ve got a watertight alibi and nothing to fear.",
    "Still when you thundered out that stuff about concealing things I felt a \nnasty prick of conscience and I thought I\u2019d like to get it off my mind.\u201d \n\nHe got up again and stood smiling at us.",
    "\u201cYou are a very wise young man\u201d said Poirot nodding at him with \napproval.",
    "\u201cSee you when I know that anyone is hiding things from me I \n\n\n\nsuspect that the thing hidden may be something very bad indeed.",
    "You have \ndone well.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m cleared from suspicion\u201d laughed Raymond.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll be off \nnow.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo that is that\u201d I remarked as the door closed behind the young \nsecretary.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d agreed Poirot.",
    "\u201cA mere bagatelle\u2014but if he had not been in the \nbilliard room\u2014who knows After all many crimes have been committed \nfor the sake of less than five hundred pounds.",
    "It all depends on what sum is \nsufficient to break a man.",
    "A question of relativity is it not so Have you \nreflected my friend that many people in that house stood to benefit by Mr. \nAckroyd\u2019s death Mrs. Ackroyd Miss Flora young Mr. Raymond the \nhousekeeper.",
    "Miss Russell.",
    "Only one in fact does not.",
    "Major Blunt.\u201d \n\nHis tone in uttering that name was so peculiar that I looked up puzzled.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t understand you\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cTwo of the people I accused have given me the truth.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou think Major Blunt has something to conceal also\u201d \n\n\u201cAs for that\u201d remarked Poirot nonchalantly \u201cthere is a saying is there \nnot that Englishmen conceal only one thing\u2014their love And Major Blunt \nI should say is not good at concealments.\u201d \n\n\u201cSometimes\u201d I said \u201cI wonder if we haven\u2019t rather jumped to \nconclusions on one point.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve assumed that the blackmailer of Mrs. Ferrars is necessarily the \nmurderer of Mr. Ackroyd.",
    "Mightn\u2019t we be mistaken\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded energetically.",
    "\u201cVery good.",
    "Very good indeed.",
    "I wondered if that idea would come to \nyou.",
    "Of course it is possible.",
    "But we must remember one point.",
    "The letter \ndisappeared.",
    "Still that as you say may not necessarily mean that the \nmurderer took it.",
    "When you first found the body Parker may have \nabstracted the letter unnoticed by you.\u201d \n\n\u201cParker\u201d \n\n\u201cYes Parker.",
    "I always come back to Parker\u2014not as the murderer\u2014no \nhe did not commit the murder but who is more suitable than he as the \nmysterious scoundrel who terrorized Mrs. Ferrars He may have got his \ninformation about Mr. Ferrars\u2019s death from one of the King\u2019s Paddock \n\n\n\nservants.",
    "At any rate he is more likely to have come upon it than a casual \nguest such as Blunt for instance.\u201d \n\n\u201cParker might have taken the letter\u201d I admitted.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t till later that \nI noticed it was gone.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow much later After Blunt and Raymond were in the room or \nbefore\u201d \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cI think it was before\u2014no \nafterwards.",
    "Yes I\u2019m almost sure it was afterwards.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat widens the field to three\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cBut Parker is \nthe most likely.",
    "It is in my mind to try a little experiment with Parker.",
    "How \nsay you my friend will you accompany me to Fernly\u201d \n\nI acquiesced and we set out at once.",
    "Poirot asked to see Miss Ackroyd \nand presently Flora came to us.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle Flora\u201d said Poirot \u201cI have to confide in you a little \nsecret.",
    "I am not yet satisfied of the innocence of Parker.",
    "I propose to make a \nlittle experiment with your assistance.",
    "I want to reconstruct some of his \nactions on that night.",
    "But we must think of something to tell him\u2014ah I \nhave it.",
    "I wish to satisfy myself as to whether voices in the little lobby could \nhave been heard outside on the terrace.",
    "Now ring for Parker if you will be \nso good.\u201d \n\nI did so and presently the butler appeared suave as ever.",
    "\u201cYou rang sir\u201d \n\n\u201cYes my good Parker.",
    "I have in mind a little experiment.",
    "I have placed \nMajor Blunt on the terrace outside the study window.",
    "I want to see if \nanyone there could have heard the voices of Miss Ackroyd and yourself in \nthe lobby that night.",
    "I want to enact that little scene over again.",
    "Perhaps you \nwould fetch the tray or whatever it was you were carrying\u201d \n\nParker vanished and we repaired to the lobby outside the study door.",
    "Presently we heard a chink in the outer hall and Parker appeared in the \ndoorway carrying a tray with a siphon a decanter of whisky and two \nglasses on it.",
    "\u201cOne moment\u201d cried Poirot raising his hand and seemingly very \nexcited.",
    "\u201cWe must have everything in order.",
    "Just as it occurred.",
    "It is a little \nmethod of mine.\u201d \n\n\u201cA foreign custom sir\u201d said Parker.",
    "\u201cReconstruction of the crime they \ncall it do they not\u201d \n\n\n\nHe was quite imperturbable as he stood there politely waiting on \nPoirot\u2019s orders.",
    "\u201cAh he knows something the good Parker\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cHe has read \nof these things.",

    "You came from the outer hall\u2014so.",
    "Mademoiselle was\u2014where\u201d \n\n\u201cHere\u201d said Flora taking up her stand just outside the study door.",
    "\u201cQuite right sir\u201d said Parker.",

    "\u201cI hope you\u2019re not annoyed It was very careless of me.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut not at all my good friend not at all.",
    "I laid no commands upon you.",
    "You were at liberty to speak of it if you so wished.",
    "She was interested your \nsister\u201d \n\n\u201cShe was indeed.",
    "It created a sensation.",

    "The true explanation leapt to the eye did it \nnot\u201d \n\n\u201cDid it\u201d I said drily.",

    "You acted I understand for the late Mrs. Ferrars \nof King\u2019s Paddock\u201d \n\nI noticed the swift gleam of surprise which showed in the lawyer\u2019s eyes \nbefore his professional reserve came down once more like a mask over his \nface.",
    "\u201cCertainly.",
    "All her affairs passed through our hands.\u201d \n\n\u201cVery good.",
    "Now before I ask you to tell me anything I should like you \nto listen to the story Dr. Sheppard will relate to you.",
    "You have no objection \nhave you my friend to repeating the conversation you had with Mr. \nAckroyd last Friday night\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNot in the least\u201d I said and straightway began the recital of that \nstrange evening.",

    "I have suspected \nsomething of the kind for some time.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat brings us\u201d said Poirot \u201cto the information for which I am asking.",
    "If anyone can give us an idea of the actual sums paid you are the man \nmonsieur.\u201d \n\n\u201cI see no object in withholding the information\u201d said Hammond after a \nmoment or two.",
    "\u201cDuring the past year Mrs. Ferrars has sold out certain \nsecurities and the money for them was paid into her account and not \nreinvested.",
    "As her income was a large one and she lived very quietly after \nher husband\u2019s death it seems certain that these sums of money were paid \naway for some special purpose.",
    "I once sounded her on the subject and she \nsaid that she was obliged to support several of her husband\u2019s poor relations.",
    "I let the matter drop of course.",

    "It appears that we were eating chops for lunch\u2014the \nkitchen staff being regaled on tripe and onions.",

    "Life was \nnot very easy for that mother and daughter.",
    "There were bills\u2014there was \nconstant trouble over small sums of money.",
    "Roger Ackroyd was a peculiar \nman over money matters.",
    "The girl might be at her wits\u2019 end for a \n\n\n\ncomparatively small sum.",
    "Figure to yourself then what happens.",
    "She has \ntaken the money she descends the little staircase.",
    "When she is halfway \ndown she hears the chink of glass from the hall.",
    "She has not a doubt of what \nit is\u2014Parker coming to the study.",
    "At all costs she must not be found on the \nstairs\u2014Parker will not forget it he will think it odd.",
    "If the money is missed \nParker is sure to remember having seen her come down those stairs.",
    "She has \njust time to rush down to the study door\u2014with her hand on the handle to \nshow that she has just come out when Parker appears in the doorway.",
    "She \nsays the first thing that comes into her head a repetition of Roger \nAckroyd\u2019s orders earlier in the evening and then goes upstairs to her own \nroom.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes but later\u201d persisted the inspector \u201cshe must have realized the \nvital importance of speaking the truth Why the whole case hinges on it\u201d \n\n\u201cAfterwards\u201d said Poirot drily \u201cit was a little difficult for \nMademoiselle Flora.",
    "She is told simply that the police are here and that \nthere has been a robbery.",
    "Naturally she jumps to the conclusion that the \ntheft of the money has been discovered.",
    "Her one idea is to stick to her story.",
    "When she learns that her uncle is dead she is panicstricken.",
    "Young women \ndo not faint nowadays monsieur without considerable provocation.",
    "Eh \nbien There it is.",
    "She is bound to stick to her story or else confess \neverything.",
    "And a young and pretty girl does not like to admit that she is a \nthief\u2014especially before those whose esteem she is anxious to retain.\u201d \n\nRaglan brought his fist down with a thump on the table.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll not believe it\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not credible.",
    "And you\u2014you\u2019ve \nknown this all along\u201d \n\n\u201cThe possibility has been in my mind from the first\u201d admitted Poirot.",
    "\u201cI \nwas always convinced that Mademoiselle Flora was hiding something from \nus.",
    "To satisfy myself I made the little experiment I told you of.",
    "Dr. \n\nSheppard accompanied me.\u201d \n\n\u201cA test for Parker you said it was\u201d I remarked bitterly.",
    "\u201cMon ami\u201d said Poirot apologetically \u201cas I told you at the time one \nmust say something.\u201d \n\nThe inspector rose.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing for it\u201d he declared.",
    "\u201cWe must tackle the young \nlady right away.",
    "You\u2019ll come up to Fernly with me M. Poirot\u201d \n\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "Dr. Sheppard will drive us up in his car.\u201d \n\nI acquiesced willingly.",
    "On inquiry for Miss Ackroyd we were shown into the billiard room.",
    "Flora and Major Hector Blunt were sitting on the long window seat.",
    "\u201cGood morning.",
    "Miss Ackroyd\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cCan we have a \nword or two alone with you\u201d \n\nBlunt got up at once and moved to the door.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d asked Flora nervously.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t go.",
    "Major Blunt.",
    "He can \nstay can\u2019t he\u201d she asked turning to the inspector.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s as you like\u201d said the inspector drily.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a question or two \nit\u2019s my duty to put to you miss but I\u2019d prefer to do so privately and I dare \nsay you\u2019d prefer it also.\u201d \n\nFlora looked keenly at him.",
    "I saw her face grow whiter.",
    "Then she turned \nand spoke to Blunt.",
    "\u201cI want you to stay\u2014please\u2014yes I mean it.",
    "Whatever the inspector has \nto say to me.",
    "I\u2019d rather you heard it.\u201d \n\nRaglan shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cWell if you will have it so that\u2019s all there is to it.",
    "Now Miss Ackroyd \nM. Poirot here has made a certain suggestion to me.",
    "He suggests that you \nweren\u2019t in the study at all last Friday night that you never saw Mr. Ackroyd \nto say goodnight to him that instead of being in the study you were on the \nstairs leading down from your uncle\u2019s bedroom when you heard Parker \ncoming across the hall.\u201d \n\nFlora\u2019s gaze shifted to Poirot.",
    "He nodded back at her.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle the other day when we sat round the table I implored \nyou to be frank with me.",
    "What one does not tell to Papa Poirot he finds out.",
    "It was that was it not See I will make it easy for you.",
    "You took the money \ndid you not\u201d \n\n\u201cThe money\u201d said Blunt sharply.",
    "There was a silence which lasted for at least a minute.",
    "Then Flora drew herself up and spoke.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Poirot is right.",
    "I took that money.",
    "I stole.",
    "I am a thief\u2014yes a \ncommon vulgar little thief.",
    "Now you know I am glad it has come out.",
    "It\u2019s \nbeen a nightmare these last few days\u201d She sat down suddenly and buried \nher face in her hands.",
    "She spoke huskily through her fingers.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t \nknow what my life has been since I came here.",
    "Wanting things scheming \nfor them lying cheating running up bills promising to pay\u2014oh I hate \nmyself when I think of it all That\u2019s what brought us together Ralph and I.",
    "We were both weak I understood him and I was sorry\u2014because I\u2019m the \n\n\n\nsame underneath.",
    "We\u2019re not strong enough to stand alone either of us.",
    "We\u2019re weak miserable despicable things.\u201d \n\nShe looked at Blunt and suddenly stamped her foot.",
    "\u201cWhy do you look at me like that\u2014as though you couldn\u2019t believe I \nmay be a thief\u2014but at any rate I\u2019m real now.",
    "I\u2019m not lying any more.",
    "I\u2019m \nnot pretending to be the kind of girl you like young and innocent and \nsimple.",
    "I don\u2019t care if you never want to see me again.",
    "I hate myself \ndespise myself\u2014but you\u2019ve got to believe one thing if speaking the truth \nwould have made things better for Ralph I would have spoken out.",
    "But I\u2019ve \nseen all along that it wouldn\u2019t be better for Ralph\u2014it makes the case \nagainst him blacker than ever.",
    "I was not doing him any harm by sticking to \nmy lie.\u201d \n\n\u201cRalph\u201d said Blunt.",
    "\u201cI see\u2014always Ralph.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u201d said Flora hopelessly.",
    "\u201cYou never will.\u201d \n\nShe turned to the inspector.",
    "\u201cI admit everything I was at my wits\u2019 end for money.",
    "I never saw my \nuncle that evening after he left the dinner table.",
    "As to the money you can \ntake what steps you please.",
    "Nothing could be worse than it is now\u201d \n\nSuddenly she broke down again hid her face in her hands and rushed \nfrom the room.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said the inspector in a flat tone \u201cso that\u2019s that.\u201d \n\nHe seemed rather at a loss what to do next.",
    "Blunt came forward.",
    "\u201cInspector Raglan\u201d he said quietly \u201cthat money was given to me by \nMr. Ackroyd for a special purpose.",
    "Miss Ackroyd never touched it.",
    "When \nshe says she did she is lying with the idea of shielding Captain Paton.",
    "The \ntruth is as I said and I am prepared to go into the witnessbox and swear to \nit.\u201d \n\nHe made a kind of jerky bow then turning abruptly he left the room.",
    "Poirot was after him in a flash.",
    "He caught the other up in the hall.",
    "\u201cMonsieur\u2014a moment I beg of you if you will be so good.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell sir\u201d \n\nBlunt was obviously impatient.",
    "He stood frowning down on Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt is this\u201d said Poirot rapidly \u201cI am not deceived by your little fantasy.",
    "No indeed.",
    "It was truly Miss Flora who took the money.",
    "All the same it is \nwell imagined what you say\u2014it pleases me.",
    "It is very good what you have \ndone there.",
    "You are a man quick to think and to act.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the least anxious for your opinion thank you\u201d said Blunt \ncoldly.",
    "He made once more as though to pass on but Poirot not at all offended \nlaid a detaining hand on his arm.",
    "\u201cAh but you are to listen to me.",
    "I have more to say.",
    "The other day I \nspoke of concealments.",
    "Very well all along I have seen what you are \nconcealing.",
    "Mademoiselle Flora you love her with all your heart.",
    "From the \nfirst moment you saw her is it not so Oh let us not mind saying these \nthings\u2014why must one in England think it necessary to mention love as \nthough it were some disgraceful secret You love Mademoiselle Flora.",
    "You \nseek to conceal that fact from all the world.",
    "That is very good\u2014that is as it \nshould be.",
    "But take the advice of Hercule Poirot\u2014do not conceal it from \nmademoiselle herself.\u201d \n\nBlunt had shown several signs of restlessness whilst Poirot was \nspeaking but the closing words seemed to rivet his attention.",
    "\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean by that\u201d he said sharply.",
    "\u201cYou think that she loves the Capitaine Ralph Paton\u2014but I Hercule \nPoirot tell you that that is not so.",
    "Mademoiselle Flora accepted Captain \nPaton to please her uncle and because she saw in the marriage a way of \nescape from her life here which was becoming frankly insupportable to her.",
    "She liked him and there was much sympathy and understanding between \nthem.",
    "But love\u2014no It is not Captain Paton Mademoiselle Flora loves.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat the devil do you mean\u201d asked Blunt.",
    "I saw the dark flush under his tan.",
    "\u201cYou have been blind monsieur.",
    "Blind She is loyal the little one.",
    "Ralph Paton is under a cloud she is bound in honour to stick by him.\u201d \n\nI felt it was time I put in a word to help on the good work.",
    "\u201cMy sister told me the other night\u201d I said encouragingly \u201cthat Flora \nhad never cared a penny piece for Ralph Paton and never would.",
    "My sister \nis always right about these things.\u201d \n\nBlunt ignored my wellmeant offers.",
    "He spoke to Poirot.",
    "\u201cD\u2019you really think\u2014\u201d he began and stopped.",
    "He is one of those inarticulate men who find it hard to put things into \nwords.",
    "Poirot knows no such disability.",
    "\u201cIf you doubt me ask her yourself monsieur.",
    "But perhaps you no \nlonger care to\u2014the affair of the money\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\nBlunt gave a sound like an angry laugh.",
    "\u201cThink I\u2019d hold that against her Roger was always a queer chap about \nmoney.",
    "She got in a mess and didn\u2019t dare tell him.",
    "Poor kid.",
    "Poor lonely \nkid.\u201d \n\nPoirot looked thoughtfully at the side door.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle Flora went into the garden I think\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve been every kind of a fool\u201d said Blunt abruptly.",
    "\u201cRum \nconversation we\u2019ve been having.",
    "Like one of those Danish plays.",
    "But \nyou\u2019re a sound fellow M. Poirot.",
    "Thank you.\u201d \n\nHe took Poirot\u2019s hand and gave it a grip which caused the other to \nwince in anguish.",
    "Then he strode to the side door and passed out into the \ngarden.",
    "\u201cNot every kind of a fool\u201d murmured Poirot tenderly nursing the \ninjured member.",
    "\u201cOnly one kind\u2014the fool in love.\u201d \n\n\n\nTwent y \n\n\nMISS RUSSELL \n\n\nInspector Raglan had received a bad jolt.",
    "He was not deceived by Blunt\u2019s \nvaliant lie any more than we had been.",
    "Our way back to the village was \npunctuated by his complaints.",
    "\u201cThis alters everything this does.",
    "I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ve realized \nit.",
    "Monsieur Poirot\u201d \n\n\u201cI think so yes I think so\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou see me I have been \nfamiliar with the idea for some time.\u201d \n\nInspector Raglan who had only had the idea presented to him a short \nhalf hour ago looked at Poirot unhappily and went on with his discoveries.",
    "\u201cThose alibis now.",
    "Worthless Absolutely worthless.",
    "Got to start again.",
    "Find out what everyone was doing from ninethirty onwards.",
    "Ninethirty\u2014 \nthat\u2019s the time we\u2019ve got to hang on to.",
    "You were quite right about the man \nKent\u2014we don\u2019t release him yet awhile.",
    "Let me see now\u2014ninefortyfive at \nthe Dog and Whistle.",
    "He might have got there in a quarter of an hour if he \nran.",
    "It\u2019s just possible that it was his voice Mr. Raymond heard talking to Mr. \nAckroyd\u2014asking for money which Mr. Ackroyd refused.",
    "But one thing\u2019s \nclear\u2014it wasn\u2019t he who sent the telephone message.",
    "The station is half a \nmile in the other direction\u2014over a mile and a half from the Dog and \nWhistle and he was at the Dog and Whistle until about ten minutes past \nten.",
    "Dang that telephone call We always come up against it.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe do indeed\u201d agreed Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt is curious.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just possible that if Captain Paton climbed into his uncle\u2019s room \nand found him there murdered he may have sent it.",
    "Got the wind up \nthought he\u2019d be accused and cleared out.",
    "That\u2019s possible isn\u2019t it\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy should he have telephoned\u201d \n\n\u201cMay have had doubts if the old man was really dead.",
    "Thought he\u2019d get \nthe doctor up there as soon as possible but didn\u2019t want to give himself \n\n\n\naway.",
    "Yes I say now how\u2019s that for a theory Something in that I should \nsay.\u201d \n\nThe inspector swelled his chest out importantly.",
    "He was so plainly \ndelighted with himself that any words of ours would have been quite \nsuperfluous.",
    "We arrived back at my house at this minute and I hurried in to my \nsurgery patients who had all been waiting a considerable time leaving \nPoirot to walk to the police station with the inspector.",
    "Having dismissed the last patient I strolled into the little room at the \nback of the house which I call my workshop\u2014I am rather proud of the \nhomemade wireless set I turned out.",
    "Caroline hates my workroom.",
    "I have \nkept my tools there and Annie is not allowed to wreak havoc with a \ndustpan and brush.",
    "I was just adjusting the interior of an alarm clock which \nhad been denounced as wholly unreliable by the household when the door \nopened and Caroline put her head in.",
    "\u201cOh there you are James\u201d she said with deep disapproval.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Poirot \nwants to see you.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell\u201d I said rather irritably for her sudden entrance had startled me \nand I had let go of a piece of delicate mechanism.",
    "\u201cIf he wants to see me he \ncan come in here.\u201d \n\n\u201cIn here\u201d said Caroline.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what I said\u2014in here.\u201d \n\nCaroline gave a sniff of disapproval and retired.",
    "She returned in a \nmoment or two ushering in Poirot and then retired again shutting the door \nwith a bang.",
    "\u201cAha my friend\u201d said Poirot coming forward and rubbing his hands.",
    "\u201cYou have not got rid of me so easily you see\u201d \n\n\u201cFinished with the inspector\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cFor the moment yes.",
    "And you you have seen all the patients\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\nPoirot sat down and looked at me tilting his eggshaped head on one \nside with the air of one who savours a very delicious joke.",
    "\u201cYou are in error\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cYou have still one patient to see.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot you\u201d I exclaimed in surprise.",
    "\u201cAh not me bien entendu.",
    "Me I have the health magnificent.",
    "No to \ntell you the truth it is a little complot of mine.",
    "There is someone I wish to \nsee you understand\u2014and at the same time it is not necessary that the whole \n\n\n\nvillage should intrigue itself about the matter\u2014which is what would happen \nif the lady were seen to come to my house\u2014for it is a lady.",
    "But to you she \nhas already come as a patient before.\u201d \n\n\u201cMiss Russell\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cPrecisement.",
    "I wish much to speak with her so I send her the little note \nand make the appointment in your surgery.",
    "You are not annoyed with me\u201d \n\n\u201cOn the contrary\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cThat is presuming I am allowed to be \npresent at the interview\u201d \n\n\u201cBut naturally In your own surgery\u201d \n\n\u201cYou know\u201d I said throwing down the pincers I was holding \u201cit\u2019s \nextraordinarily intriguing the whole thing.",
    "Every new development that \narises is like the shake you give to a kaleidoscope\u2014the thing changes \nentirely in aspect.",
    "Now why are you so anxious to see Miss Russell\u201d \n\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.",
    "\u201cSurely it is obvious\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cThere you go again\u201d I grumbled.",
    "\u201cAccording to you everything is \nobvious.",
    "But you leave me walking about in a fog.\u201d \n\nPoirot shook his head genially to me.",
    "\u201cYou mock yourself at me.",
    "Take the matter of Mademoiselle Flora.",
    "The \ninspector was surprised\u2014but you\u2014you were not.\u201d \n\n\u201cI never dreamed of her being the thief\u201d I expostulated.",
    "\u201cThat\u2014perhaps no.",
    "But I was watching your face and you were not\u2014 \nlike Inspector Raglan\u2014startled and incredulous.\u201d \n\nI thought for a minute or two.",
    "\u201cPerhpas you are right\u201d I said at last.",
    "\u201cAll along I\u2019ve felt that Flora was \nkeeping back something\u2014so the truth when it came was subconsciously \nexpected.",
    "It upset Inspector Raglan very much indeed poor man.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh pour ga oui The poor man must rearrange all his ideas.",
    "I profited \nby his state of mental chaos to induce him to grant me a little favour.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat was that\u201d \n\nPoirot took a sheet of notepaper from his pocket.",
    "Some words were \nwritten on it and he read them aloud.",
    "\u201cThe police have for some days been seeking for Captain Ralph Paton \nthe nephew of Mr. Ackroyd of Fernly Park whose death occurred under \nsuch tragic circumstances last Friday.",
    "Captain Paton has been found at \nFiverpool where he was on the point of embarking for America.\u201d \n\nHe folded up the piece of paper again.",
    "\u201cThat my friend will be in the newspapers tomorrow morning.\u201d \n\nI stared at him dumbfounded.",
    "\u201cBut\u2014but it isn\u2019t true He\u2019s not at Liverpool\u201d \n\nPoirot beamed on me.",
    "\u201cYou have the intelligence so quick No he has not been found at \nLiverpool.",
    "Inspector Raglan was very loath to let me send this paragraph to \nthe press especially as I could not take him into my confidence.",
    "But I \nassured him most solemnly that very interesting results would follow its \nappearance in print so he gave in after stipulating that he was on no \naccount to bear the responsibility.\u201d \n\nI stared at Poirot.",
    "He smiled back at me.",
    "\u201cIt beats me\u201d I said at last \u201cwhat you expect to get out of that.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou should employ your little grey cells\u201d said Poirot gravely.",
    "He rose and came across to the bench.",
    "\u201cIt is that you have really the love of the machinery\u201d he said after \ninspecting the debris of my labours.",
    "Every man has his hobby.",
    "I immediately drew Poirot\u2019s attention to my \nhomemade wireless.",
    "Finding him sympathetic I showed him one or two \nlittle inventions of my own\u2014trifling things but useful in the house.",
    "\u201cDecidedly\u201d said Poirot \u201cyou should be an inventor by trade not a \ndoctor.",
    "But I hear the bell\u2014that is your patient.",
    "Let us go into the surgery.\u201d \n\nOnce before I had been struck by the remnants of beauty in the \nhousekeeper\u2019s face.",
    "This morning I was struck anew.",
    "Very simply dressed \nin black tall upright and independent as ever with her big dark eyes and an \nunwonted flush of colour in her usually pale cheeks I realized that as a girl \nshe must have been startlingly handsome.",
    "\u201cGood morning mademoiselle\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cWill you be seated Dr. \nSheppard is so kind as to permit me the use of his surgery for a little \nconversation I am anxious to have with you.\u201d \n\nMiss Russell sat down with her usual composure.",
    "If she felt any inward \nagitation it did not display itself in any outward manifestation.",
    "\u201cIt seems a queer way of doing things if you\u2019ll allow me to say so\u201d she \nremarked.",
    "\u201cMiss Russell\u2014I have news to give you.\u201d \n\n\u201cIndeed\u201d \n\n\u201cCharles Kent has been arrested at Liverpool.\u201d \n\n\n\nNot a muscle of her face moved.",
    "She merely opened her eyes a trifle \nwider and asked with a tinge of defiance \n\n\u201cWell what of it\u201d \n\nBut at that moment it came to me\u2014the resemblance that had haunted \nme all along something familiar in the defiance of Charles Kent\u2019s manner.",
    "The two voices one rough and coarse the other painfully ladylike\u2014were \nstrangely the same in timbre.",
    "It was of Miss Russell that I had been \nreminded that night outside the gates of Fernly Park.",
    "I looked at Poirot full of my discovery and he gave me an \nimperceptible nod.",
    "In answer to Miss Russell\u2019s question he threw out his hands in a \nthoroughly French gesture.",

    "\u201cAnd you what did you do\u201d \n\n\u201cI went back to the house.",
    "Major Blunt was walking up and down the \nterrace smoking so I made a detour to get round to the side door.",

    "It all \nseemed very clear.",
    "She had heard from someone that morning\u2014someone \naddicted to drugs she read the article in the paper and she came to ask you \na few tentative questions.",
    "She mentioned cocaine since the article in \nquestion was on cocaine.",
    "Then when you seemed too interested she \nswitched hurriedly to the subject of detective stories and untraceable \npoisons.",
    "I suspected a son or a brother or some other undesirable male \nrelation.",
    "Ah but I must go.",
    "It is the time of the lunch.\u201d \n\n\u201cStay and lunch with us\u201d I suggested.",

    "\u201cMe I have been well amused.",
    "This \npark is magnificent.\u201d \n\nWe set off homewards.",
    "When we arrived to our great surprise Caroline \nwho had evidently been watching for us herself opened the door.",
    "She put her finger to her lips.",
    "Her face was full of importance and \nexcitement.",
    "\u201cUrsula Bourne\u201d she said \u201cthe parlourmaid from Fernly.",
    "She\u2019s here \nI\u2019ve put her in the dining room.",
    "She\u2019s in a terrible way poor thing.",
    "Says she \nmust see M. Poirot at once.",
    "I\u2019ve done all I could.",
    "Taken her a cup of hot tea.",
    "It really goes to one\u2019s heart to see anyone in such a state.\u201d \n\n\u201cIn the dining room\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cThis way\u201d I said and flung open the door.",
    "Ursula Bourne was sitting by the table.",
    "Her arms were spread out in \nfront of her and she had evidently just lifted her head from where it had \nbeen buried.",
    "Her eyes were red with weeping.",
    "\u201cUrsula Bourne\u201d I murmured.",
    "But Poirot went past me with outstretched hands.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said \u201cthat is not quite right I think.",
    "It is not Ursula Bourne is \nit my child\u2014but Ursula Paton Mrs. Ralph Paton.\u201d \n\n\n\nTwentvtwo \n\n\nURSULA\u2019S STORY \n\n\nFor a moment or two the girl looked mutely at Poirot.",
    "Then her reserve \nbreaking down completely she nodded her head once and burst into an \noutburst of sobs.",
    "Caroline pushed past me and putting her arm round the girl patted her \non the shoulder.",
    "\u201cThere there my dear\u201d she said soothingly \u201cit will be all right.",
    "You\u2019ll \nsee\u2014everything will be all right.\u201d \n\nBuried under curiosity and scandalmongering there is a lot of kindness \nin Caroline.",
    "For the moment even the interest of Poirot\u2019s revelation was \nlost in the sight of the girl\u2019s distress.",
    "Presently Ursula sat up and wiped her eyes.",
    "\u201cThis is very weak and silly of me\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cNo no my child\u201d said Poirot kindly.",
    "\u201cWe can all realize the strain of \nthis last week.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt must have been a terrible ordeal\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAnd then to find that you knew\u201d continued Ursula.",
    "\u201cHow did you \nknow Was it Ralph who told you\u201d \n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cYou know what brought me to you tonight\u201d went on the girl.",
    "\u201cThis \u2014\u201d \n\nShe held out a crumpled piece of newspaper and I recognized the \nparagraph that Poirot had had inserted.",
    "\u201cIt says that Ralph has been arrested.",
    "So everything is useless.",
    "I need \nnot pretend any longer.\u201d \n\n\u201cNewspaper paragraphs are not always true mademoiselle\u201d murmured \nPoirot having the grace to look ashamed of himself.",
    "\u201cAll the same I think \nyou will do well to make a clean breast of things.",
    "The truth is what we need \nnow.\u201d \n\nThe girl hesitated looking at him doubtfully.",
    "\u201cYou do not trust me\u201d said Poirot gently.",
    "\u201cYet all the same you came \nhere to find me did you not Why was that\u201d \n\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t believe that Ralph did it\u201d said the girl in a very low \nvoice.",
    "\u201cAnd I think that you are clever and will find out the truth.",
    "And also \n\n\u201cYes\u201d \n\n\u201cI think you are kind.\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded his head several times.",
    "\u201cIt is very good that\u2014yes it is very good.",
    "Listen I do in verity believe \nthat this husband of yours is innocent\u2014but the affair marches badly.",
    "If I am \nto save him I must know all there is to know\u2014even if it should seem to \nmake the case against him blacker than before.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow well you understand\u201d said Ursula.",
    "\u201cSo you will tell me the whole story will you not From the \nbeginning.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to send me away I hope\u201d said Caroline settling \nherself comfortably in an armchair.",
    "\u201cWhat I want to know\u201d she continued \n\u201cis why this child was masquerading as a parlourmaid\u201d \n\n\u201cMasquerading\u201d I queried.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.",
    "Why did you do it child For a wager\u201d \n\n\u201cFor a living\u201d said Ursula drily.",
    "And encouraged she began the story which I reproduce here in my own \nwords.",
    "Ursula Bourne it seemed was one of a family of seven\u2014impoverished \nIrish gentlefolk.",
    "On the death of her father most of the girls were cast out \ninto the world to earn their own living.",
    "Ursula\u2019s eldest sister was married to \nCaptain Folliott.",
    "It was she whom I had seen that Sunday and the cause of \nher embarrassment was clear enough now.",
    "Determined to earn her living \nand not attracted to the idea of being a nursery governess\u2014the one \nprofession open to an untrained girl\u2014Ursula preferred the job of \nparlourmaid.",
    "She scorned to label herself a \u201clady parlourmaid.\u201d She would \nbe the real thing her reference being supplied by her sister.",
    "At Fernly \ndespite an aloofness which as has been seen caused some comment she \nwas a success at her job\u2014quick competent and thorough.",
    "\u201cI enjoyed the work\u201d she explained.",
    "\u201cAnd I had plenty of time to \nmyself.\u201d \n\n\n\nAnd then came her meeting with Ralph Paton and the love affair which \nculminated in a secret marriage.",
    "Ralph had persuaded her into that \nsomewhat against her will.",
    "He had declared that his stepfather would not \nhear of his marrying a penniless girl.",
    "Better to be married secretly and \nbreak the news to him at some later and more favourable minute.",
    "And so the deed was done and Ursula Bourne became Ursula Paton.",
    "Ralph had declared that he meant to pay off his debts find a job and then \nwhen he was in a position to support her and independent of his adopted \nfather they would break the news to him.",
    "But to people like Ralph Paton turning over a new leaf is easier in \ntheory than in practice.",
    "He hoped that his stepfather whilst still in \nignorance of the marriage might be persuaded to pay his debts and put him \non his feet again.",
    "But the revelation of the amount of Ralph\u2019s liabilities \nmerely enraged Roger Ackroyd and he refused to do anything at all.",
    "Some \nmonths passed and then Ralph was bidden once more to Fernly.",
    "Roger \nAckroyd did not beat about the bush.",
    "It was the desire of his heart that \nRalph should marry Flora and he put the matter plainly before the young \nman.",
    "And here it was that the innate weakness of Ralph Paton showed itself.",
    "As always he grasped at the easy the immediate solution.",
    "As far as I could \nmake out neither Flora nor Ralph made any pretence of love.",
    "It was on \nboth sides a business arrangement.",
    "Roger Ackroyd dictated his wishes\u2014 \nthey agreed to them.",
    "Flora accepted a chance of liberty money and an \nenlarged horizon Ralph of course was playing a different game.",
    "But he \nwas in a very awkward hole financially.",
    "He seized at the chance.",
    "His debts \nwould be paid.",
    "He could start again with a clean sheet.",
    "His was not a nature \nto envisage the future but I gather that he saw vaguely the engagement with \nFlora being broken off after a decent interval had elapsed.",
    "Both Flora and \nhe stipulated that it should be kept a secret for the present.",
    "He was anxious \nto conceal it from Ursula.",
    "He felt instinctively that her nature strong and \nresolute with an inherent distaste for duplicity was not one to welcome \nsuch a course.",
    "Then came the crucial moment when Roger Ackroyd always high\u00ac \nhanded decided to announce the engagement.",
    "He said no word of his \nintention to Ralph\u2014only to Flora and Flora apathetic raised no objection.",
    "On Ursula the news fell like a bombshell.",
    "Summoned by her Ralph came \nhurriedly down from town.",
    "They met in the wood where part of their \n\n\n\nconversation was overheard by my sister.",
    "Ralph implored her to keep silent \nfor a little while longer Ursula was equally determined to have done with \nconcealments.",
    "She would tell Mr. Ackroyd the truth without any further \ndelay.",
    "Husband and wife parted acrimoniously.",
    "Ursula steadfast in her purpose sought an interview with Roger \nAckroyd that very afternoon and revealed the truth to him.",
    "Their interview \nwas a stormy one\u2014it might have been even more stormy had not Roger \nAckroyd been already obsessed with his own troubles.",
    "It was bad enough \nhowever.",
    "Ackroyd was not the kind of man to forgive the deceit that had \nbeen practised upon him.",
    "His rancour was mainly directed to Ralph but \nUrsula came in for her share since he regarded her as a girl who had \ndeliberately tried to \u201centrap\u201d the adopted son of a very wealthy man.",
    "Unforgivable things were said on both sides.",
    "That same evening Ursula met Ralph by appointment in the small \nsummerhouse stealing out from the house by the side door in order to do \nso.",
    "Their interview was made up of reproaches on both sides.",
    "Ralph charged \nUrsula with having irretrievably ruined his prospects by her illtimed \nrevelation.",
    "Ursula reproached Ralph with his duplicity.",
    "They parted at last.",
    "A little over half an hour later came the discovery of \nRoger Ackroyd\u2019s body.",
    "Since that night Ursula had neither seen nor heard \nfrom Ralph.",
    "As the story unfolded itself I realized more and more what a damning \nseries of facts it was.",
    "Alive Ackroyd could hardly have failed to alter his \nwill\u2014I knew him well enough to realize that to do so would be his first \nthought.",
    "His death came in the nick of time for Ralph and Ursula Paton.",
    "Small wonder the girl had held her tongue and played her part so \nconsistently.",
    "My meditations were interrupted.",
    "It was Poirot\u2019s voice speaking and I \nknew from the gravity of his tone that he too was fully alive to the \nimplications of the position.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle I must ask you one question and you must answer it \ntruthfully for on it everything may hang What time was it when you parted \nfrom Captain Ralph Paton in the summerhouse Now take a little minute so \nthat your answer may be very exact.\u201d \n\nThe girl gave a half laugh bitter enough in all conscience.",
    "\u201cDo you think I haven\u2019t gone over that again and again in my own \nmind It was just half past nine when I went out to meet him.",
    "Major Blunt \n\n\n\nwas walking up and down the terrace so I had to go round through the \nbushes to avoid him.",
    "It must have been about twentyseven minutes to ten \nwhen I reached the summerhouse.",
    "Ralph was waiting for me.",
    "I was with \nhim ten minutes\u2014not longer for it was just a quarter to ten when I got back \nto the house.\u201d \n\nI saw now the insistence of her question the other day.",
    "If only Ackroyd \ncould have been proved to have been killed before a quarter to ten and not \nafter.",
    "I saw the reflection of that thought in Poirot\u2019s next question.",
    "\u201cWho left the summerhouse first\u201d \n\n\u201cI did.\u201d \n\n\u201cLeaving Ralph Paton in the summerhouse\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u2014but you don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cMademoiselle it is of no importance what I think.",
    "What did you do \nwhen you got back to the house\u201d \n\n\u201cI went up to my room.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd stayed there until when\u201d \n\n\u201cUntil about ten o\u2019clock.\u201d \n\n\u201cIs there anyone who can prove that\u201d \n\n\u201cProve That I was in my room you mean Oh no.",
    "But surely\u2014oh I \nsee they might think\u2014they might think\u2014\u201d \n\nI saw the dawning horror in her eyes.",
    "Poirot finished the sentence for her.",
    "\u201cThat it was you who entered by the window and stabbed Mr. Ackroyd \nas he sat in his chair Yes they might think just that.\u201d \n\n\u201cNobody but a fool would think any such thing\u201d said Caroline \nindignantly.",
    "She patted Ursula on the shoulder.",
    "The girl had her face hidden in her hands.",
    "\u201cHorrible\u201d she was murmuring.",
    "\u201cHorrible.\u201d \n\nCaroline gave her a friendly shake.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t worry my dear\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Poirot doesn\u2019t think that really.",
    "As for that husband of yours I don\u2019t think much of him and I tell you so \ncandidly.",
    "Running away and leaving you to face the music.\u201d \n\nBut Ursula shook her head energetically.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that at all.",
    "Ralph would not run away \non his own account.",
    "I see now.",
    "If he heard of his stepfather\u2019s murder he \n\n\n\nmight think himself that I had done it.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t think any such thing\u201d said Caroline.",
    "\u201cI was so cruel to him that night\u2014so hard and bitter.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t listen to \nwhat he was trying to say\u2014wouldn\u2019t believe that he really cared.",
    "I just \nstood there telling him what I thought of him and saying the coldest \ncruellest things that came into my mind\u2014trying my best to hurt him.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo him no harm\u201d said Caroline.",
    "\u201cNever worry about what you say to \na man.",
    "They\u2019re so conceited that they never believe you mean it if it\u2019s \nunflattering.\u201d \n\nUrsula went on nervously twisting and untwisting her hands.",
    "\u201cWhen the murder was discovered and he didn\u2019t come forward I was \nterribly upset.",
    "Just for a moment I wondered\u2014but then I knew he couldn\u2019t \n\u2014he couldn\u2019t.. .But I wished he would come forward and say openly that \nhe\u2019d had nothing to do with it.",
    "I knew that he was fond of Dr. Sheppard and \nI fancied that perhaps Dr. Sheppard might know where he was hiding.\u201d \n\nShe turned to me.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s why I said what I did to you that day.",
    "I thought if you knew \nwhere he was you might pass on the message to him.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cWhy should James know where he was\u201d demanded Caroline sharply.",
    "\u201cIt was very unlikely I know\u201d admitted Ursula \u201cbut Ralph had often \nspoken of Dr. Sheppard and I knew that he would be likely to consider him \nas his best friend in King\u2019s Abbot.\u201d \n\n\u201cMy dear child\u201d I said \u201cI have not the least idea where Ralph Paton is \nat the present moment.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is true enough\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Ursula held out the newspaper cutting in a puzzled fashion.",

    "You\u2019ll stay here for \nthe present anyway\u2014eh M. Poirot\u201d \n\n\u201cIt will be the best plan\u201d agreed the little Belgian.",

    "Nine o\u2019clock at my house.",

    "\u201cSo far so good\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThings are straightening themselves out.\u201d \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting to look blacker and blacker against Ralph Paton\u201d I \nobserved gloomily.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYes that is so.",
    "But it was to be expected was it not\u201d \n\nI looked at him slightly puzzled by the remark.",
    "He was leaning back in \nthe chair his eyes half closed the tips of his fingers just touching each \nother.",
    "Suddenly he sighed and shook his head.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cIt is that there are moments when a great longing for my friend \nHastings comes over me.",
    "That is the friend of whom I spoke to you\u2014the \none who resides now in the Argentine.",
    "Always when I have had a big case \nhe has been by my side.",
    "And he has helped me\u2014yes often he has helped \nme.",
    "For he had a knack that one of stumbling over the truth unawares\u2014 \nwithout noticing it himself bien entendu.",
    "At times he has said something \n\n\n\n\n\nparticularly foolish and behold that foolish remark has revealed the truth to \nme And then too it was his practice to keep a written record of the cases \nthat proved interesting.\u201d \n\nI gave a slightly embarrassed cough.",
    "\u201cAs far as that goes\u201d I began and then stopped.",
    "Poirot sat upright in his chair.",
    "His eyes sparkled.",
    "\u201cBut yes What is it that you would say\u201d \n\n\u201cWell as a matter of fact.",
    "I\u2019ve read some of Captain Hasting\u2019s \nnarratives and I thought why not try my hand at something of the same \nkind.",
    "Seemed a pity not to\u2014unique opportunity\u2014probably the only time \nI\u2019ll be mixed up with anything of this kind.\u201d \n\nI felt myself getting hotter and hotter and more and more incoherent as \nI floundered through the above speech.",
    "Poirot sprang from his chair.",
    "I had a moment\u2019s terror that he was going \nto embrace me French fashion but mercifully he refrained.",
    "\u201cBut this is magnificent\u2014you have then written down your impressions \nof the case as you went along\u201d \n\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cEpatant\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cLet me see them\u2014this instant.\u201d \n\nI was not quite prepared for such a sudden demand.",
    "I racked my brains \nto remember certain details.",
    "\u201cI hope you won\u2019t mind\u201d I stammered.",
    "\u201cI may have been a little\u2014er\u2014 \npersonal now and then.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh I comprehend perfectly you have referred to me as comic\u2014as \nperhaps ridiculous now and then It matters not at all.",
    "Hastings he also \nwas not always polite.",
    "Me I have the mind above such trivialities.\u201d \n\nStill somewhat doubtful I rummaged in the drawers of my desk and \nproduced an untidy pile of manuscript which I handed over to him.",
    "With an \neye on possible publication in the future I had divided the work into \nchapters and the night before I had brought it up to date with an account of \nMiss Russell\u2019s visit.",
    "Poirot had therefore twenty chapters.",
    "I left him with them.",
    "I was obliged to go out to a case at some distance away and it was past \neight o\u2019clock when I got back to be greeted with a plate of hot dinner on a \ntray and the announcement that Poirot and my sister had supped together at \nhalf past seven and that the former had then gone to my workshop to finish \nhis reading of the manuscript.",
    "\u201cI hope James\u201d said my sister \u201cthat you\u2019ve been careful in what you \nsay about me in it\u201d \n\nMy jaw dropped.",
    "I had not been careful at all.",
    "\u201cNot that it matters very much\u201d said Caroline reading my expression \ncorrectly.",

    "Poirot will know what to think.",
    "He understands me much \nbetter than you do.\u201d \n\nI went into the workshop.",

    "The \nmanuscript lay neatly piled on a chair beside him.",
    "He laid his hand on it and \nspoke.",
    "\u201cEh bien\u201d he said \u201cI congratulate you\u2014on your modesty\u201d \n\n\u201cOh\u201d I said rather taken aback.",
    "\u201cAnd on your reticence\u201d he added.",
    "I said \u201cOh\u201d again.",

    "\u201cWhat do you really think of the stuff\u201d I asked nervously.",
    "\u201cYou want my candid opinion\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\nPoirot laid his jesting manner aside.",
    "\u201cA very meticulous and accurate account\u201d he said kindly.",
    "\u201cYou have \nrecorded all the facts faithfully and exactly\u2014though you have shown \nyourself becomingly reticent as to your own share in them.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd it has helped you\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.",
    "I may say that it has helped me considerably.",
    "Come we must go \nover to my house and set the stage for my little performance.\u201d \n\nCaroline was in the hall.",
    "I think she hoped that she might be invited to \naccompany us.",
    "Poirot dealt with the situation tactfully.",
    "\u201cI should much like to have had you present mademoiselle\u201d he said \nregretfully \u201cbut at this juncture it would not be wise.",
    "See you all these \npeople tonight are suspects.",

    "\u201cYou are ready my child\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat is good.",
    "We will go to my \nhouse together.",
    "Mademoiselle Caroline believe me I do everything \npossible to render you service.",
    "Good evening.\u201d \n\nWe went off leaving Caroline rather like a dog who has been refused a \nwalk standing on the front door step gazing after us.",
    "The sitting room at The Larches had been got ready.",
    "On the table were \nvarious siropes and glasses.",
    "Also a plate of biscuits.",
    "Several chairs had been \nbrought in from the other room.",
    "Poirot ran to and fro rearranging things.",
    "Pulling out a chair here \naltering the position of a lamp there occasionally stooping to straighten one \nof the mats that covered the floor.",
    "He was specially fussing over the \nlighting.",
    "The lamps were arranged in such a way as to throw a clear light on \nthe side of the room where the chairs were grouped at the same time \nleaving the other end of the room where I presumed Poirot himself would \nsit in a dim twilight.",
    "Ursula and I watched him.",
    "Presently a bell was heard.",
    "\u201cThey arrive\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cGood all is in readiness.\u201d \n\nThe door opened and the party from Fernly filed in.",
    "Poirot went forward \nand greeted Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora.",
    "\u201cIt is most good of you to come\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAnd Major Blunt and Mr. \nRaymond.\u201d \n\nThe secretary was debonair as ever.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the great idea\u201d he said laughing.",
    "\u201cSome scientific machine \nDo we have bands round our wrists which register guilty heartbeats There \nis such an invention isn\u2019t there\u201d \n\n\u201cI have read of it yes\u201d admitted Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut me I am oldfashioned.",
    "I \nuse the old methods.",
    "I work only with the little grey cells.",
    "Now let us begin \n\u2014but first I have an announcement to make to you all.\u201d \n\nHe took Ursula\u2019s hand and drew her forward.",
    "\u201cThis lady is Mrs. Ralph Paton.",
    "She was married to Captain Paton last \nMarch.\u201d \n\nA little shriek burst from Mrs. Ackroyd.",
    "\u201cRalph Married Last March Oh but it\u2019s absurd.",
    "How could he be\u201d \n\nShe stared at Ursula as though she had never seen her before.",
    "\u201cMarried to Bourne\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cReally M. Poirot I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d \n\nUrsula flushed and began to speak but Flora forestalled her.",
    "Going quickly to the other girl\u2019s side she passed her hand through her \narm.",
    "\u201cYou must not mind our being surprised\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou see we had no \nidea of such a thing.",
    "You and Ralph have kept your secret very well.",
    "I am\u2014 \nvery glad about it.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou are very kind.",
    "Miss Ackroyd\u201d said Ursula in a low voice \u201cand \nyou have every right to be exceedingly angry.",
    "Ralph behaved very badly\u2014 \nespecially to you.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about that\u201d said Flora giving her arm a consoling \nlittle pat.",
    "\u201cRalph was in a corner and took the only way out.",
    "I should \nprobably have done the same in his place.",
    "I do think he might have trusted \nme with the secret though.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t have let him down.\u201d \n\nPoirot rapped gently on a table and cleared his throat significantly.",
    "\u201cThe board meeting\u2019s going to begin\u201d said Flora.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Poirot hints that \nwe mustn\u2019t talk.",
    "But just tell me one thing.",
    "Where is Ralph You must \nknow if anyone does.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t\u201d cried Ursula almost in a wail.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s just it I don\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he detained at Liverpool\u201d asked Raymond.",
    "\u201cIt said so in the \npaper.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe is not at Liverpool\u201d said Poirot shortly.",
    "\u201cIn fact\u201d I remarked \u201cno one knows where he is.\u201d \n\n\u201cExcept Hercule Poirot eh\u201d said Raymond.",
    "Poirot replied seriously to the other\u2019s banter.",
    "\u201cMe I know everything.",
    "Remember that.\u201d \n\nGeoffrey Raymond lifted his eyebrows.",
    "\u201cEverything\u201d He whistled.",
    "\u201cWhew that\u2019s a tall order.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you mean to say you can really guess where Ralph Paton is \nhiding\u201d I asked incredulously.",
    "\u201cYou call it guessing.",
    "I call it knowing my friend.\u201d \n\n\u201cIn Cranchester\u201d I hazarded.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d replied Poirot gravely \u201cnot in Cranchester.\u201d \n\nHe said no more but at a gesture from him the assembled party took \ntheir seats.",
    "As they did so the door opened once more and two other people \ncame in and sat down near the door.",
    "They were Parker and the housekeeper.",
    "\u201cThe number is complete\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cEveryone is here.\u201d \n\nThere was a ring of satisfaction in his tone.",
    "And with the sound of it I \nsaw a ripple of something like uneasiness pass over all those faces grouped \n\n\n\nat the other end of the room.",
    "There was a suggestion in all this as of a trap \n\u2014a trap that had closed.",
    "Poirot read from a list in an important manner.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Ackroyd Miss Flora Ackroyd Major Blunt Mr. Geoffrey \nRaymond Mrs. Ralph Paton John Parker Elizabeth Russell.\u201d \n\nHe laid the paper down on the table.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of all this\u201d began Raymond.",
    "\u201cThe list I have just read\u201d said Poirot \u201cis a list of suspected persons.",
    "Every one of you present had the opportunity to kill Mr. Ackroyd\u2014\u201d \n\nWith a cry Mrs. Ackroyd sprang up her throat working.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d she wailed.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t like it.",
    "I would much prefer to go \nhome.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou cannot go home madame\u201d said Poirot sternly \u201cuntil you have \nheard what I have to say.\u201d \n\nHe paused a moment then cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cI will start at the beginning.",
    "When Miss Ackroyd asked me to \ninvestigate the case I went up to Fernly Park with the good Doctor \nSheppard.",
    "I walked with him along the terrace where I was shown the \nfootprints on the windowsill.",
    "From there Inspector Raglan took me along \nthe path which leads to the drive.",
    "My eye was caught by a little \nsummerhouse and I searched it thoroughly.",
    "I found two things\u2014a scrap of \nstarched cambric and an empty goose quill.",
    "The scrap of cambric \nimmediately suggested to me a maid\u2019s apron.",
    "When Inspector Raglan \nshowed me his list of the people in the house I noticed at once that one of \nthe maids\u2014Ursula Bourne the parlourmaid\u2014had no real alibi.",
    "According \nto her own story she was in her bedroom from ninethirty until ten.",
    "But \nsupposing that instead she was in the summerhouse If so she must have \ngone there to meet someone.",
    "Now we know from Dr. Sheppard that \nsomeone from outside did come to the house that night\u2014the stranger whom \nhe met just by the gate.",
    "At first glance it would seem that our problem was \nsolved and that the stranger went to the summerhouse to meet Ursula \nBourne.",
    "It was fairly certain that he did go to the summerhouse because of \nthe goose quill.",
    "That suggested at once to my mind a taker of drugs\u2014and \none who had acquired the habit on the other side of the Atlantic where \nsniffing \u2018snow\u2019 is more common than in this country.",
    "The man whom Dr. \nSheppard met had an American accent which fitted in with that \nsupposition.",
    "\u201cBut I was held up by one point.",
    "The times did not fit.",
    "Ursula Bourne \ncould certainly not have gone to the summerhouse before ninethirty \nwhereas the man must have got there by a few minutes past nine.",
    "I could of \ncourse assume that he waited there for half an hour.",
    "The only alternative \nsupposition was that there had been two separate meetings in the \nsummerhouse that night.",
    "Eh bien as soon as I went into that alternative I \nfound several significant facts.",
    "I discovered that Miss Russell the \nhousekeeper had visited Dr. Sheppard that morning and had displayed a \ngood deal of interest in cures for victims of the drug habit.",
    "Taking that in \nconjunction with the goose quill I assumed that the man in question came \nto Fernly to meet the housekeeper and not Ursula Bourne.",
    "Who then did \nUrsula Bourne come to the rendezvous to meet I was not long in doubt.",
    "First I found a ring\u2014a wedding ring\u2014with \u2018From R.\u2019 and a date inside it.",
    "Then I learnt that Ralph Paton had been seen coming up the path which led \nto the summerhouse at twentyfive minutes past nine and I also heard of a \ncertain conversation which had taken place in the wood near the village that \nvery afternoon\u2014a conversation between Ralph Paton and some unknown \ngirl.",
    "Sol had my facts succeeding each other in a neat and orderly manner.",
    "A secret marriage an engagement announced on the day of the tragedy the \nstormy interview in the wood and the meeting arranged for the \nsummerhouse that night.",
    "\u201cIncidentally this proved to me one thing that both Ralph Paton and \nUrsula Bourne or Paton had the strongest motives for wishing Mr. \nAckroyd out of the way.",
    "And it also made one other point unexpectedly \nclear.",
    "It could not have been Ralph Paton who was with Mr. Ackroyd in the \nstudy at ninethirty.",
    "\u201cSo we come to another and most interesting aspect of the crime.",
    "Who \nwas it in the room with Mr. Ackroyd at ninethirty Not Ralph Paton who \nwas in the summerhouse with his wife.",
    "Not Charles Kent who had already \nleft.",
    "Who then I posed my cleverest\u2014my most audacious question Was \nanyone with him\u201d \n\nPoirot leaned forward and shot the last words triumphantly at us \ndrawing back afterwards with the air of one who has made a decided hit.",
    "Raymond however did not seem impressed and lodged a mild protest.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re trying to make me out a liar M. Poirot but the \nmatter does not rest on my evidence alone\u2014except perhaps as to the exact \nwords used.",
    "Remember Major Blunt also heard Mr. Ackroyd talking to \n\n\n\nsomeone.",
    "He was on the terrace outside and couldn\u2019t catch the words \nclearly but he distinctly heard the voices.\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cI have not forgotten\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cBut Major Blunt was under the \nimpression that it was you to whom Mr. Ackroyd was speaking.\u201d \n\nFor a moment Raymond seemed taken aback.",
    "Then he recovered \nhimself.",
    "\u201cBlunt knows now that he was mistaken\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cExactly\u201d agreed the other man.",
    "\u201cYet there must have been some reason for his thinking so\u201d mused \nPoirot.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d he held up his hand in protest \u201cI know the reason you \nwill give\u2014but it is not enough.",
    "We must seek elsewhere.",
    "I will put it this \nway.",
    "From the beginning of the case I have been struck by one thing\u2014the \nnature of those words which Mr. Raymond overheard.",
    "It has been amazing \nto me that no one has commented on them\u2014has seen anything odd about \nthem.\u201d \n\nHe paused a minute and then quoted softly \n\n\u201c.. .the calls on my purse have been so frequent of late that I fear it is \nimpossible for me to accede to your request.",
    "Does nothing strike you as odd \nabout that\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d said Raymond.",
    "\u201cHe has frequently dictated letters to \nme using almost exactly those same words.\u201d \n\n\u201cExactly\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat is what I seek to arrive at.",
    "Would any man \nuse such a phrase in talking to another Impossible that that should be part \nof a real conversation.",
    "Now if he had been dictating a letter\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cYou mean he was reading a letter aloud\u201d said Raymond slowly.",
    "\u201cEven \nso he must have been reading to someone.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut why We have no evidence that there was anyone else in the room.",
    "No other voice but Mr. Ackroyd\u2019s was heard remember.\u201d \n\n\u201cSurely a man wouldn\u2019t read letters of that type aloud to himself\u2014not \nunless he was\u2014well\u2014going barmy.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou have all forgotten one thing\u201d said Poirot softly \u201cthe stranger who \ncalled at the house the preceding Wednesday.\u201d \n\nThey all stared at him.",
    "\u201cBut yes\u201d said Poirot nodding encouragingly \u201con Wednesday.",
    "The \nyoung man was not of himself important.",
    "But the firm he represented \ninterested me very much.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThe Dictaphone Company\u201d gasped Raymond.",
    "\u201cI see it now.",
    "A \ndictaphone.",
    "That\u2019s what you think\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Ackroyd had promised to invest in a dictaphone you remember.",
    "Me I had the curiosity to inquire of the company in question.",
    "Their reply is \nthat Mr. Ackroyd did purchase a dictaphone from their representative.",
    "Why \nhe concealed the matter from you I do not know.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe must have meant to surprise me with it\u201d murmured Raymond.",
    "\u201cHe \nhad quite a childish love of surprising people.",
    "Meant to keep it up his sleeve \nfor a day or so.",
    "Probably was playing with it like a new toy.",
    "Yes it fits in.",
    "You\u2019re quite right\u2014no one would use quite those words in casual \nconversation.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt explains too\u201d said Poirot \u201cwhy Major Blunt thought it was you \nwho were in the study.",
    "Such scraps as came to him were fragments of \ndictation and so his subconscious mind deduced that you were with him.",
    "His conscious mind was occupied with something quite different\u2014the \nwhite figure he had caught a glimpse of.",
    "He fancied it was Miss Ackroyd.",
    "Really of course it was Ursula Bourne\u2019s white apron he saw as she was \nstealing down to the summerhouse.\u201d \n\nRaymond had recovered from his first surprise.",
    "\u201cAll the same\u201d he remarked \u201cthis discovery of yours brilliant though it \nis I\u2019m quite sure I should never have thought of it leaves the essential \nposition unchanged.",
    "Mr. Ackroyd was alive at ninethirty since he was \nspeaking into the dictaphone.",
    "It seems clear that the man Charles Kent was \nreally off the premises by then.",
    "As to Ralph Paton\u2014\u201d \n\nHe hesitated glancing at Ursula.",
    "Her colour flared up but she answered steadily enough.",
    "\u201cRalph and I parted just before a quarter to ten.",
    "He never went near the \nhouse I am sure of that.",
    "He had no intention of doing so.",
    "The last thing on \nearth he wanted was to face his stepfather.",
    "He would have funked it badly.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that I doubt your story for a moment\u201d explained Raymond.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve always been quite sure Captain Paton was innocent.",
    "But one has to \nthink of a court of law\u2014and the questions that would be asked.",
    "He is in a \nmost unfortunate position but if he were to come forward\u2014\u201d \n\nPoirot interrupted.",
    "\u201cThat is your advice yes That he should come forward\u201d \n\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "If you know where he is\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI perceive that you do not believe that I do know.",
    "And yet I have told \nyou just now that I know everything.",
    "The truth of the telephone call of the \nfootprints on the windowsill of the hidingplace of Ralph Paton\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere is he\u201d said Blunt sharply.",
    "\u201cNot very far away\u201d said Poirot smiling.",
    "\u201cIn Cranchester\u201d I asked.",
    "Poirot turned towards me.",
    "\u201cAlways you ask me that.",
    "The idea of Cranchester it is with you an idee \nfixe.",
    "No he is not in Cranchester.",
    "He is\u2014 there\u201d \n\nHe pointed a dramatic forefinger.",
    "Everyone\u2019s head turned.",
    "Ralph Paton was standing in the doorway.",
    "Twentyfour \n\n\nRALPH PATON\u2019S STORY \n\n\nIt was a very uncomfortable minute for me.",
    "I hardly took in what happened \nnext but there were exclamations and cries of surprise When I was \nsufficiently master of myself to be able to realize what was going on Ralph \nPaton was standing by his wife her hand in his and he was smiling across \nthe room at me.",
    "Poirot too was smiling and at the same time shaking an eloquent \nfinger at me.",
    "\u201cHave I not told you at least thirtysix times that it is useless to conceal \nthings from Hercule Poirot\u201d he demanded.",
    "\u201cThat in such a case he finds \nout\u201d \n\nHe turned to the others.",
    "\u201cOne day you remember we held a little seance about a table\u2014just the \nsix of us.",
    "I accused the other five persons present of concealing something \nfrom me.",
    "Four of them gave up their secret.",
    "Dr. Sheppard did not give up \nhis.",
    "But all along I have had my suspicions.",
    "Dr. Sheppard went to the Three \nBoars that night hoping to find Ralph.",
    "He did not find him there but \nsupposing I said to myself that he met him in the street on his way home \nDr. Sheppard was a friend of Captain Paton\u2019s and he had come straight \nfrom the scene of the crime.",
    "He must know that things looked very black \nagainst him.",
    "Perhaps he knew more than the general public did\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cI did\u201d I said ruefully.",
    "\u201cI suppose I might as well make a clean breast of \nthings now.",
    "I went to see Ralph that afternoon.",
    "At first he refused to take \nme into his confidence but later he told me about his marriage and the hole \nhe was in.",
    "As soon as the murder was discovered I realized that once the \nfacts were known suspicion could not fail to attach to Ralph\u2014or if not to \nhim to the girl he loved.",
    "That night I put the facts plainly before him.",
    "The \nthought of having possibly to give evidence which might incriminate his \nwife made him resolve at all costs to\u2014to\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\n\nI hesitated and Ralph filled up the gap.",
    "\u201cTo do a bunk\u201d he said graphically.",
    "\u201cYou see Ursula left me to go back \nto the house.",
    "I thought it possible that she might have attempted to have \nanother interview with my stepfather.",
    "He had already been very rude to her \nthat afternoon.",
    "It occurred to me that he might have so insulted her\u2014in \nsuch an unforgivable manner\u2014that without knowing what she was doing \n\nHe stopped.",
    "Ursula released her hand from his and stepped back.",
    "\u201cYou thought that Ralph You actually thought that I might have done \n\nit\u201d \n\n\u201cLet us get back to the culpable conduct of Dr. Sheppard\u201d said Poirot \ndrily.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Sheppard consented to do what he could to help him.",
    "He was \nsuccessful in hiding Captain Paton from the police.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere\u201d asked Raymond.",
    "\u201cIn his own house\u201d \n\n\u201cAh no indeed\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou should ask yourself the question \nthat I did.",
    "If the good doctor is concealing the young man what place \nwould he choose It must necessarily be somewhere near at hand.",
    "I think of \nCranchester.",
    "A hotel No.",
    "Lodgings Even more emphatically no.",
    "Where \nthen Ah I have it.",
    "A nursing home.",
    "A home for the mentally unfit.",
    "I test \nmy theory.",
    "I invent a nephew with mental trouble.",
    "I consult Mademoiselle \nSheppard as to suitable homes.",
    "She gives me the names of two near \nCranchester to which her brother has sent patients.",
    "I make inquiries.",
    "Yes at \none of them a patient was brought there by the doctor himself early on \nSaturday morning.",
    "That patient though known by another name I had no \ndifficulty in identifying as Captain Paton.",
    "After certain necessary \nformalities I was allowed to bring him away.",
    "He arrived at my house in the \nearly hours of yesterday morning.\u201d \n\nI looked at him ruefully.",
    "\u201cCaroline\u2019s Home Office expert\u201d I murmured.",
    "\u201cAnd to think I never \nguessed\u201d \n\n\u201cYou see now why I drew attention to the reticence of your \nmanuscript\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt was strictly truthful as far as it went\u2014 \nbut it did not go very far eh my friend\u201d \n\nI was too abashed to argue.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Sheppard has been very loyal\u201d said Ralph.",
    "\u201cHe has stood by me \nthrough thick and thin.",
    "He did what he thought was best.",
    "I see now from \nwhat M. Poirot has told me that it was not really the best.",
    "I should have \n\n\n\ncome forward and faced the music.",
    "You see in the home we never saw a \nnewspaper.",
    "I knew nothing of what was going on.\u201d \n\n\u201cDr.",
    "Sheppard has been a model of discretion\u201d said Poirot drily.",
    "\u201cBut \nme I discover all the little secrets.",
    "It is my business.\u201d \n\n\u201cNow we can have your story of what happened that night\u201d said \nRaymond impatiently.",
    "\u201cYou know it already\u201d said Ralph.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s very little for me to tell.",
    "I \nleft the summerhouse about nine fortyfive and tramped about the lanes \ntrying to make up my mind as to what to do next\u2014what line to take.",
    "I\u2019m \nbound to admit that I\u2019ve not the shadow of an alibi but I give you my \nsolemn word that I never went to the study that I never saw my stepfather \nalive\u2014or dead.",
    "Whatever the world thinks.",
    "I\u2019d like all of you to believe \nme.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo alibi\u201d murmured Raymond.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s bad.",
    "I believe you of course \nbut\u2014it\u2019s a bad business.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt makes things very simple though\u201d said Poirot in a cheerful voice.",
    "\u201cVery simple indeed.\u201d \n\nWe all stared at him.",
    "\u201cYou see what I mean No Just this\u2014to save Captain Paton the real \ncriminal must confess.\u201d \n\nHe beamed round at us all.",
    "\u201cBut yes\u2014I mean what I say.",
    "See now I did not invite Inspector Raglan \nto be present.",
    "That was for a reason.",
    "I did not want to tell him all that I \nknew\u2014at least I did not want to tell him tonight.\u201d \n\nHe leaned forward and suddenly his voice and his whole personality \nchanged.",
    "He suddenly became dangerous.",
    "\u201cI who speak to you\u2014I know the murderer of Mr. Ackroyd is in this \nroom now.",
    "It is to the murderer I speak.",
    "Tomorrow the truth goes to \nInspector Raglan.",
    "You understand\u201d \n\nThere was a tense silence.",
    "Into the midst of it came the old Breton \nwoman with a telegram on a salver.",
    "Poirot tore it open.",
    "Blunt\u2019s voice rose abrupt and resonant.",
    "\u201cThe murderer is amongst us you say You know\u2014which\u201d \n\nPoirot had read the message.",
    "He crumpled it up in his hand.",
    "\u201cI know\u2014now.\u201d \n\nHe tapped the crumpled ball of paper.",
    "\u201cWhat is that\u201d said Raymond sharply.",
    "\u201cA wireless message\u2014from a steamer now on her way to the United \nStates.\u201d \n\nThere was a dead silence.",
    "Poirot rose to his feet bowing.",
    "\u201cMessieurs et Mesdames this reunion of mine is at an end.",
    "Remember \n\u2014the truth goes to Inspector Raglan in the morning .\u201d \n\n\n\nTwentyfive \n\n\nTHE WHOLE TRUTH \n\n\nA slight gesture from Poirot enjoined me to stay behind the rest.",
    "I obeyed \ngoing over to the fire and thoughtfully stirring the big logs on it with the toe \nof my boot.",
    "I was puzzled.",
    "For the first time I was absolutely at sea as to Poirot\u2019s \nmeaning.",
    "For a moment I was inclined to think that the scene I had just \nwitnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast\u2014that he had been what he \ncalled \u201cplaying the comedy\u201d with a view to making himself interesting and \nimportant.",
    "But in spite of myself I was forced to believe in an underlying \nreality.",
    "There had been real menace in his words\u2014a certain indisputable \nsincerity.",
    "But I still believed him to be on entirely the wrong tack.",
    "When the door shut behind the last of the party he came over to the fire.",
    "\u201cWell my friend\u201d he said quietly \u201cand what do you think of it all\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think\u201d I said frankly.",
    "\u201cWhat was the point Why \nnot go straight to Inspector Raglan with the truth instead of giving the guilty \nperson this elaborate warning\u201d \n\nPoirot sat down and drew out his case of tiny Russian cigarettes.",
    "He \nsmoked for a minute or two in silence.",
    "Then \n\n\u201cUse your little grey cells\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere is always a reason behind \nmy actions.\u201d \n\nI hesitated for a moment and then I said slowly \n\n\u201cThe first one that occurs to me is that you yourself do not know who \nthe guilty person is but that you are sure that he is to be found amongst the \npeople here tonight.",
    "Therefore your words were intended to force a \nconfession from the unknown murderer\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded approvingly.",
    "\u201cA clever idea but not the truth.\u201d \n\n\u201cI thought perhaps that by making him believe you knew you might \nforce him out into the open\u2014not necessarily by confession.",
    "He might try to \n\n\n\n\nsilence you as he formerly silenced Mr. Ackroyd\u2014before you could act \ntomorrow morning.\u201d \n\n\u201cA trap with myself as the bait Merci mon ami but I am not \nsufficiently heroic for that.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen I fail to understand you.",
    "Surely you are running the risk of letting \nthe murderer escape by thus putting him on his guard\u201d \n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cHe cannot escape\u201d he said gravely.",
    "\u201cThere is only one way out\u2014and \nthat way does not lead to freedom.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou really believe that one of those people here tonight committed the \nmurder\u201d I asked incredulously.",
    "\u201cYes my friend.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhich one\u201d \n\nThere was a silence for some minutes.",
    "Then Poirot tossed the stump of \nhis cigarette into the grate and began to speak in a quiet reflective tone.",
    "\u201cI will take you the way that I have travelled myself.",
    "Step by step you \nshall accompany me and see for yourself that all the facts point \nindisputably to one person.",
    "Now to begin with there were two facts and a \nlittle discrepancy in time which especially attracted my attention.",
    "The first \nfact was the telephone call.",
    "If Ralph Paton were indeed the murderer the \ntelephone call became meaningless and absurd.",
    "Therefore I said to myself \nRalph Paton is not the murderer.",
    "\u201cI satisfied myself that the call could not have been sent by anyone in \nthe house yet I was convinced that it was amongst those present on the fatal \nevening that I had to look for my criminal.",
    "Therefore I concluded that the \ntelephone call must have been sent by an accomplice.",
    "I was not quite \npleased with that deduction but I let it stand for the minute.",
    "\u201cI next examined the motive for the call.",
    "That was difficult.",
    "I could only \nget at it by judging its result.",
    "Which was\u2014that the murder was discovered \nthat night instead of\u2014in all probability\u2014the following morning.",
    "You agree \nwith that\u201d \n\n\u201cYees\u201d I admitted.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "As you say Mr. Ackroyd having given \norders that he was not to be disturbed nobody would have been likely to go \nto the study that night.\u201d \n\n\u201cTres bien.",
    "The affair marches does it not But matters were still \nobscure.",
    "What was the advantage of having the crime discovered that night \nin preference to the following morning The only idea I could get hold of \n\n\n\nwas that the murderer knowing the crime was to be discovered at a certain \ntime could make sure of being present when the door was broken in\u2014or at \nany rate immediately afterwards.",
    "And now we come to the second fact\u2014the \nchair pulled out from the wall.",
    "Inspector Raglan dismissed that as of no \nimportance.",
    "I on the contrary have always regarded it as of supreme \nimportance.",
    "\u201cIn your manuscript you have drawn a neat little plan of the study.",
    "If \nyou had it with you this minute you would see that\u2014the chair being drawn \nout in the position indicated by Parker\u2014it would stand in a direct line \nbetween the door and the window.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe window\u201d I said quickly.",
    "\u201cYou too have my first idea.",
    "I imagined that the chair was drawn out \nso that something connected with the window should not be seen by anyone \nentering through the door.",
    "But I soon abandoned that supposition for \nthough the chair was a grandfather with a high back it obscured very little \nof the window\u2014only the part between the sash and the ground.",
    "No mon \nami \u2014but remember that just in front of the window there stood a table with \nbooks and magazines upon it.",
    "Now that table was completely hidden by the \ndrawnout chair\u2014and immediately I had my first shadowy suspicion of the \ntruth.",
    "\u201cSupposing that there had been something on that table not intended to \nbe seen Something placed there by the murderer As yet I had no inkling \nof what that something might be.",
    "But I knew certain very interesting facts \nabout it.",
    "For instance it was something that the murderer had not been able \nto take away with him at the time that he committed the crime.",
    "At the same \ntime it was vital that it should be removed as soon as possible after the \ncrime had been discovered.",
    "And so\u2014the telephone message and the \nopportunity for the murderer to be on the spot when the body was \ndiscovered.",
    "\u201cNow four people were on the scene before the police arrived.",
    "Yourself \nParker Major Blunt and Mr. Raymond.",
    "Parker I eliminated at once since at \nwhatever time the crime was discovered he was the one person certain to \nbe on the spot.",
    "Also it was he who told me of the pulledout chair.",
    "Parker \nthen was cleared of the murder that is.",
    "I still thought it possible that he \nhad been blackmailing Mrs. Ferrars.",
    "Raymond and Blunt however \nremained under suspicion since if the crime had been discovered in the \nearly hours of the morning it was quite possible that they might have \n\n\n\narrived on the scene too late to prevent the object on the round table being \ndiscovered.",
    "\u201cNow what was that object You heard my arguments tonight in \nreference to the scrap of conversation overheard As soon as I learned that a \nrepresentative of a dictaphone company had called the idea of a dictaphone \ntook root in my mind.",
    "You heard what I said in this room not half an hour \nago They all agreed with my theory\u2014but one vital fact seems to have \nescaped them.",
    "Granted that a dictaphone was being used by Mr. Ackroyd \nthat night\u2014why was no dictaphone found\u201d \n\n\u201cI never thought of that\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWe know that a dictaphone was supplied to Mr. Ackroyd.",
    "But no \ndictaphone has been found amongst his effects.",
    "So if something was taken \nfrom the table\u2014why should not that something be the dictaphone But \nthere were certain difficulties in the way.",
    "The attention of everyone was of \ncourse focused on the murdered man.",
    "I think anyone could have gone to \nthe table unnoticed by the other people in the room.",
    "But a dictaphone has a \ncertain bulk\u2014it cannot be slipped casually into a pocket.",
    "There must have \nbeen a receptacle of some kind capable of holding it.",
    "\u201cYou see where I am arriving The figure of the murderer is taking \nshape.",
    "A person who was on the scene straightaway but who might not \nhave been if the crime had been discovered the following morning.",
    "A \nperson carrying a receptacle into which the dictaphone might be fitted\u2014\u201d \n\nI interrupted.",
    "\u201cBut why remove the dictaphone What was the point\u201d \n\n\u201cYou are like Mr. Raymond.",
    "You take it for granted that what was heard \nat ninethirty was Mr. Ackroyd\u2019s voice speaking into a dictaphone.",
    "But \nconsider this useful invention for a little minute.",
    "You dictate into it do you \nnot And at some later time a secretary or a typist turns it on and the voice \nspeaks again.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d I gasped.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYes I meant that.",
    "At ninethirty Mr. Ackroyd was already dead.",
    "It was \nthe dictaphone speaking\u2014not the man.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd the murderer switched it on.",
    "Then he must have been in the room \nat that minute\u201d \n\n\u201cPossibly.",
    "But we must not exclude the likelihood of some mechanical \ndevice having been applied\u2014something after the nature of a time lock or \n\n\n\neven of a simple alarm clock.",
    "But in that case we must add two \nqualifications to our imaginary portrait of the murderer.",
    "It must be someone \nwho knew of Mr. Ackroyd\u2019s purchase of the dictaphone and also someone \nwith the necessary mechanical knowledge.",
    "\u201cI had got thus far in my own mind when we came to the footprints on \nthe window ledge.",
    "Here there were three conclusions open to me.",
    "1 They \nmight really have been made by Ralph Paton.",
    "He had been at Fernly that \nnight and might have climbed into the study and found his uncle dead \nthere.",
    "That was one hypothesis.",
    "2 There was the possibility that the \nfootmarks might have been made by somebody else who happened to have \nthe same kind of studs in his shoes.",
    "But the inmates of the house had shoes \nsoled with crepe rubber and I declined to believe in the coincidence of \nsomeone from outside having the same kind of shoes as Ralph Paton wore.",
    "Charles Kent as we know from the barmaid of the Dog and Whistle had on \na pair of boots \u2018clean dropping off him.\u2019 3 Those prints were made by \nsomeone deliberately trying to throw suspicion on Ralph Paton.",
    "To test this \nlast conclusion it was necessary to ascertain certain facts.",
    "One pair of \nRalph\u2019s shoes had been obtained from the Three Boars by the police.",
    "Neither Ralph nor anyone else could have worn them that evening since \nthey were downstairs being cleaned.",
    "According to the police theory Ralph \nwas wearing another pair of the same kind and I found out that it was true \nthat he had two pairs.",
    "Now for my theory to be proved correct it was \nnecessary for the murderer to have worn Ralph\u2019s shoes that evening\u2014in \nwhich case Ralph must have been wearing yet a third pair of footwear of \nsome kind.",
    "I could hardly suppose that he would bring three pairs of shoes \nall alike\u2014the third pair of footwear were more likely to be boots.",
    "I got your \nsister to make inquiries on this point\u2014laying some stress on the colour in \norder\u2014I admit it frankly\u2014to obscure the real reason for my asking.",
    "\u201cYou know the result of her investigations.",
    "Ralph Paton had had a pair \nof boots with him.",
    "The first question I asked him when he came to my \nhouse yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the fatal \nnight.",
    "He replied at once that he had worn boots \u2014he was still wearing \nthem in fact\u2014having nothing else to put on.",
    "\u201cSo we get a step further in our description of the murderer\u2014a person \nwho had the opportunity to take these shoes of Ralph Paton\u2019s from the \nThree Boars that day.\u201d \n\nHe paused and then said with a slightly raised voice \n\n\n\n\u201cThere is one further point.",
    "The murderer must have been a person who \nhad the opportunity to purloin that dagger from the silver table.",
    "You might \nargue that anyone in the house might have done so but I will recall to you \nthat Flora Ackroyd was very positive that the dagger was not there when \nshe examined the silver table.\u201d \n\nHe paused again.",
    "\u201cLet us recapitulate\u2014now that all is clear.",
    "A person who was at the \nThree Boars earlier that day a person who knew Ackroyd well enough to \nknow that he had purchased a dictaphone a person who was of a \nmechanical turn of mind who had the opportunity to take the dagger from \nthe silver table before Miss Flora arrived who had with him a receptacle \nsuitable for hiding the dictaphone\u2014such as a black bag\u2014and who had the \nstudy to himself for a few minutes after the crime was discovered while \nParker was telephoning for the police.",
    "In fact \u2014Dr Sheppard\u201d \n\n\n\nTwentvsix \n\n\nAND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH \n\n\nThere was a dead silence for a minute and a half.",
    "Then I laughed.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re mad\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d said Poirot placidly.",
    "\u201cI am not mad.",
    "It was the little discrepancy \nin time that first drew my attention to you\u2014right at the beginning.\u201d \n\n\u201cDiscrepancy in time\u201d I queried puzzled.",
    "\u201cBut yes.",
    "You will remember that everyone agreed\u2014you yourself \nincluded\u2014that it took five minutes to walk from the lodge to the house\u2014 \nless if you took the short cut to the terrace.",
    "But you left the house at ten \nminutes to nine\u2014both by your own statement and that of Parker and yet it \nwas nine o\u2019clock when you passed through the lodge gates.",
    "It was a chilly \nnight\u2014not an evening a man would be inclined to dawdle why had you \ntaken ten minutes to do a five minutes\u2019 walk All along I realized that we \nhad only your statement for it that the study window was ever fastened.",
    "Ackroyd asked you if you had done so\u2014he never looked to see.",
    "Supposing \nthen that the study window was unfastened Would there be time in that ten \nminutes for you to run round the outside of the house change your shoes \nclimb in through the window kill Ackroyd and get to the gate by nine \no\u2019clock I decided against that theory since in all probability a man as \nnervous as Ackroyd was that night would hear you climbing in and then \nthere would have been a struggle.",
    "But supposing that you killed Ackroyd \nbefore you left\u2014as you were standing beside his chair Then you go out of \nthe front door run round to the summerhouse take Ralph Paton\u2019s shoes out \nof the bag you brought up with you that night slip them on walk through \nthe mud in them and leave prints on the window ledge you climb in lock \nthe study door on the inside run back to the summerhouse change back \ninto your own shoes and race down to the gate.",
    "I went through similar \nactions the other day when you were with Mrs. Ackroyd\u2014it took ten \n\n\n\n\nminutes exactly.",
    "Then home\u2014and an alibi\u2014since you had timed the \ndictaphone for half past nine.\u201d \n\n\u201cMy dear Poirot\u201d I said in a voice that sounded strange and forced to \nmy own ears \u201cyou\u2019ve been brooding over this case too long.",
    "What on earth \nhad I to gain by murdering Ackroyd\u201d \n\n\u201cSafety.",
    "It was you who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars.",
    "Who could have had \na better knowledge of what killed Mr. Ferrars than the doctor who was \nattending him When you spoke to me that first day in the garden you \nmentioned a legacy received about a year ago.",
    "I have been unable to \ndiscover any trace of a legacy.",
    "You had to invent some way of accounting \nfor Mrs. Ferrars\u2019s twenty thousand pounds.",
    "It has not done you much good.",
    "You lost most of it in speculation\u2014then you put the screw on too hard and \nMrs. Ferrars took a way out that you had not expected.",
    "If Ackroyd had \nlearnt the truth he would have had no mercy on you\u2014you were ruined for \never.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd the telephone call\u201d I asked trying to rally.",
    "\u201cYou have a plausible \nexplanation of that also I suppose\u201d \n\n\u201cI will confess to you that it was my greatest stumbling block when I \nfound that a call had actually been put through to you from King\u2019s Abbot \nstation.",
    "I at first believed that you had simply invented the story.",
    "It was a \nvery clever touch that.",
    "You must have some excuse for arriving at Fernly \nfinding the body and so getting the chance to remove the dictaphone on \nwhich your alibi depended.",
    "I had a very vague notion of how it was worked \nwhen I came to see your sister that first day and inquired as to what patients \nyou had seen on Friday morning.",
    "I had no thought of Miss Russell in my \nmind at that time.",
    "Her visit was a lucky coincidence since it distracted your \nmind from the real object of my questions.",
    "I found what I was looking for.",
    "Among your patients that morning was the steward of an American liner.",
    "Who more suitable than he to be leaving for Liverpool by the train that \nevening And afterwards he would be on the high seas well out of the way.",
    "I noted that the Orion sailed on Saturday and having obtained the name of \nthe steward I sent him a wireless message asking a certain question.",
    "This is \nhis reply you saw me receive just now.\u201d \n\nHe held out the message to me.",
    "It ran as follows \n\n\n\u201cQuite correct.",
    "Dr. Sheppard asked me to leave a note at a \npatient\u2019s house.",
    "I was to ring him up from the station with the reply.",
    "Reply was \u2018No answer.\u2019\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt was a clever idea\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe call was genuine.",
    "Your sister saw \nyou take it.",
    "But there was only one man\u2019s word as to what was actually said \n\u2014your own\u201d \n\nI yawned.",
    "\u201cAll this\u201d I said \u201cis very interesting\u2014but hardly in the sphere of \npractical politics.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou think not Remember what I said\u2014the truth goes to Inspector \nRaglan in the morning.",
    "But for the sake of your good sister I am willing to \ngive you the chance of another way out.",
    "There might be for instance an \noverdose of a sleeping draught.",
    "You comprehend me But Captain Ralph \nPaton must be cleared \u2014ga va sans dire.",
    "I should suggest that you finish \nthat very interesting manuscript of yours\u2014but abandoning your former \nreticence.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou seem to be very prolific of suggestions\u201d I remarked.",
    "\u201cAre you \nsure you\u2019ve quite finished\u201d \n\n\u201cNow that you remind me of the fact it is true that there is one thing \nmore.",
    "It would be most unwise on your part to attempt to silence me as you \nsilenced M. Ackroyd.",
    "That kind of business does not succeed against \nHercule Poirot you understand.\u201d \n\n\u201cMy dear Poirot\u201d I said smiling a little \u201cwhatever else I may be I am \nnot a fool.\u201d \n\nI rose to my feet.",
    "\u201cWell well\u201d I said with a slight yawn \u201cI must be off home.",
    "Thank you \nfor a most interesting and instructive evening.\u201d \n\nPoirot also rose and bowed with his accustomed politeness as I passed \nout of the room.",
    "Twentyseven \n\n\nAPOLOGIA \n\n\nFive a.m.",
    "I am very tired\u2014but I have finished my task.",
    "My arm aches from \nwriting.",
    "A strange end to my manuscript.",
    "I meant it to be published some day as \nthe history of one of Poirot\u2019s failures Odd how things pan out.",
    "All along I\u2019ve had a premonition of disaster from the moment I saw \nRalph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars with their heads together.",
    "I thought then that \nshe was confiding in him as it happened I was quite wrong there but the \nidea persisted even after I went into the study with Ackroyd that night until \nhe told me the truth.",
    "Poor old Ackroyd.",
    "I\u2019m always glad that I gave him a chance.",
    "I urged \nhim to read that letter before it was too late.",
    "Or let me be honest\u2014didn\u2019t I \nsubconsciously realize that with a pigheaded chap like him it was my best \nchance of getting him not to read it His nervousness that night was \ninteresting psychologically.",
    "He knew danger was close at hand.",
    "And yet he \nnever suspected me.",
    "The dagger was an afterthought.",
    "I\u2019d brought up a very handy little \nweapon of my own but when I saw the dagger lying in the silver table it \noccurred to me at once how much better it would be to use a weapon that \ncouldn\u2019t be traced to me.",
    "I suppose I must have meant to murder him all along.",
    "As soon as I heard \nof Mrs. Ferrars\u2019s death I felt convinced that she would have told him \neverything before she died.",
    "When I met him and he seemed so agitated I \nthought that perhaps he knew the truth but that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to \nbelieve it and was going to give me the chance of refuting it.",
    "So I went home and took my precautions.",
    "If the trouble were after all \nonly something to do with Ralph\u2014well no harm would have been done.",
    "The dictaphone he had given me two days ago to adjust.",
    "Something had \ngone a little wrong with it and I persuaded him to let me have a go at it.",
    "instead of sending it back.",
    "I did what I wanted to and took it up with me in \nmy bag that evening.",
    "I am rather pleased with myself as a writer.",
    "What could be neater for \ninstance than the following \n\n\u201cThe letters were brought in at twenty minutes to nine.",
    "It was just on ten \nminutes to nine when I left him the letter still unread.",
    "I hesitated with my \nhand on the door handle looking back and wondering if there was anything \nI had left undone.",
    "\u201d \n\nAll true you see.",
    "But suppose I had put a row of stars after the first \nsentence Would somebody then have wondered what exactly happened in \nthat blank ten minutes \n\nWhen I looked round the room from the door I was quite satisfied.",
    "Nothing had been left undone.",
    "The dictaphone was on the table by the \nwindow timed to go off at ninethirty the mechanism of that little device \nwas rather clever\u2014based on the principle of an alarm clock and the \narmchair was pulled out so as to hide it from the door.",
    "I must admit that it gave me rather a shock to run into Parker just \noutside the door.",
    "I have faithfully recorded that fact.",
    "Then later when the body was discovered and I sent Parker to \ntelephone for the police what a judicious use of words \u201cI did what little \nhad to be done\u201d It was quite little\u2014just to shove the dictaphone into my \nbag and push back the chair against the wall in its proper place.",
    "I never \ndreamed that Parker would have noticed that chair.",
    "Logically he ought to \nhave been so agog over the body as to be blind to everything else.",
    "But I \nhadn\u2019t reckoned with the trained servant complex.",
    "I wish I could have known beforehand that Flora was going to say she\u2019d \nseen her uncle alive at a quarter to ten.",
    "That puzzled me more than I can \nsay.",
    "In fact all through the case there have been things that puzzled me \nhopelessly.",
    "Everyone seems to have taken a hand.",
    "My greatest fear all through has been Caroline.",
    "I have fancied she might \nguess.",
    "Curious the way she spoke that day of my \u201cstrain of weakness.\u201d \n\nWell she will never know the truth.",
    "There is as Poirot said one way \nout....",
    "I can trust him.",
    "He and Inspector Raglan will manage it between them.",
    "I \nshould not like Caroline to know.",
    "She is fond of me and then too she is \nproud...My death will be a grief to her but grief passes....",
