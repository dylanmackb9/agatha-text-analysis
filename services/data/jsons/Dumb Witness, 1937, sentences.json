    "Though her illness was short her death\ndid not occasion much surprise in the little country town of Market\nBasing where she had lived since she was a girl of sixteen.",
    "For Emily\nArundell was well over seventy the last of a family of five and she had\nbeen known to be in delicate health for many years and had indeed\nnearly died of a similar attack to the one that killed her some eighteen\nmonths before.",
    "But though Miss Arundell\u2019s death surprised no one something else\ndid.",
    "The provisions of her will gave rise to varying emotions\nastonishment pleasurable excitement deep condemnation fury despair\nanger and general gossip.",
    "For weeks and even months Market Basing\nwas to talk of nothing else Everyone had their own contribution to make\nto the subject from Mr. Jones the grocer who held that \u201cblood was\nthicker than water\u201d to Mrs. Lamphrey at the post office who repeated\nad nauseam that \u201cthere\u2019s something behind it depend upon it You mark\nmy words.\u201d\nWhat added zest to the speculations on the subject was the fact that\nthe will had been made as lately as April 21st.",
    "Add to this the further fact\nthat Emily Arundell\u2019s near relations had been staying with her just before\nthat date over Easter Bank Holiday and it will be realized that the most\nscandalous theories could be propounded pleasurably relieving the\nmonotony of everyday life in Market Basing.",
    "There was one person who was shrewdly suspected of knowing more\nabout the matter than she was willing to admit.",
    "That was Miss\nWilhelmina Lawson Miss Arundell\u2019s companion.",
    "Miss Lawson\nhowever professed herself just as much in the dark as everyone else.",
    "She too she declared had been dumbfounded when the will was read\nout.",
    "A lot of people of course did not believe this.",
    "Nevertheless whether\nMiss Lawson was or was not as ignorant as she declared herself to be\nonly one person really knew the true facts.",
    "That person was the dead\nwoman herself.",
    "Emily Arundell had kept her own counsel as she was in\n\n\fthe habit of doing.",
    "Even to her lawyer she had said nothing of the\nmotives underlying her action.",
    "She was content with making her wishes\nclear.",
    "In that reticence could be found the keynote of Emily Arundell\u2019s\ncharacter.",
    "She was in every respect a typical product of her generation.",
    "She had both its virtues and its vices.",
    "She was autocratic and often\noverbearing but she was also intensely warmhearted.",

    "Emily Arundell had been a handsome girl and she was now a wellpreserved handsome old lady with a straight back and a brisk manner.",
    "A\nfaint yellowness in her skin was a warning that she could not eat rich\nfood with impunity.",
    "Miss Arundell was saying\n\u201cNow then Minnie where have you put them all\u201d\n\u201cWell I thought\u2014I hope I\u2019ve done right\u2014Dr.",
    "and Mrs. Tanios in the\nOak room and Theresa in the Blue room and Mr. Charles in the Old\nNursery\u2014\u201d\nMiss Arundell interrupted\n\u201cTheresa can have the Old Nursery and Charles will have the Blue\nroom.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014I thought the Old Nursery being rather more\ninconvenient\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt will do very nicely for Theresa.\u201d\nIn Miss Arundell\u2019s day women took second place.",
    "Men were the\nimportant members of society.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry the dear little children aren\u2019t coming\u201d murmured Miss\nLawson sentimentally.",
    "She loved children and was quite incapable of managing them.",
    "\u201cFour visitors will be quite enough\u201d said Miss Arundell.",
    "\u201cIn any\ncase Bella spoils her children abominably.",
    "They never dream of doing\nwhat they are told.\u201d\nMinnie Lawson murmured\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Tanios is a very devoted mother.\u201d\n\n\fMiss Arundell said with grave approval\n\u201cBella is a good woman.\u201d\nMiss Lawson sighed and said\n\u201cIt must be very hard for her sometimes\u2014living in an outlandish\nplace like Smyrna.\u201d\nEmily Arundell replied\n\u201cShe has made her bed and she must lie on it.\u201d\nAnd having uttered this final Victorian pronouncement she went on\n\u201cI am going to the village now to speak about the orders for the\nweekend.\u201d\n\u201cOh Miss Arundell do let me.",
    "I mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNonsense.",
    "I prefer to go myself.",
    "Rogers needs a sharp word.",
    "The\ntrouble with you is Minnie that you\u2019re not emphatic enough.",
    "Bob Bob\nWhere is the dog\u201d\nA wirehaired terrier came tearing down the stairs.",
    "He circled round\nand round his mistress uttering short staccato barks of delight and\nexpectation.",
    "Together mistress and dog passed out of the front door and down the\nshort path to the gate.",
    "Miss Lawson stood in the doorway smiling rather foolishly after\nthem her mouth a little open.",
    "Behind her a voice said tartly\n\u201cThem pillowcases you gave me miss isn\u2019t a pair.\u201d\n\u201cWhat How stupid of me\u2026.\u201d\nMinnie Lawson plunged once more into household routine.",
    "Emily Arundell attended by Bob made a royal progress down the\nmain street of Market Basing.",
    "It was very much of a royal progress.",
    "In each shop she entered the\nproprietor always hurried forward to attend to her.",
    "She was Miss Arundell of Littlegreen House.",
    "She was \u201cone of our\noldest customers.\u201d She was \u201cone of the old school.",
    "Not many about like\nher nowadays.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning miss.",
    "What can I have the pleasure of doing for you\n\u2014Not tender Well I\u2019m sorry to hear that.",
    "I thought myself it was as\nnice a little saddle\u2014Yes of course Miss Arundell.",
    "If you say so it is so\n\u2014No indeed I wouldn\u2019t think of sending Canterbury to you Miss\nArundell\u2014Yes I\u2019ll see to it myself Miss Arundell.\u201d\nBob and Spot the butcher\u2019s dog circled slowly round each other\nhackles raised growling gently.",
    "Spot was a stout dog of nondescript\nbreed.",
    "He knew that he must not fight with customers\u2019 dogs but he\n\n\fpermitted himself to tell them by subtle indication just exactly what\nmincemeat he would make of them were he free to do so.",
    "Bob a dog of spirit replied in kind.",
    "Emily Arundell said \u201cBob\u201d sharply and passed on.",
    "In the greengrocer\u2019s there was a meeting of heavenly bodies.",
    "Another\nold lady spherical in outline but equally distinguished by that air of\nroyalty said\n\u201cMornin\u2019 Emily.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning Caroline.\u201d\nCaroline Peabody said\n\u201cExpecting any of your young people down\u201d\n\u201cYes all of them.",
    "Theresa Charles and Bella.\u201d\n\u201cSo Bella\u2019s home is she Husband too\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nIt was a simple monosyllable but underlying it was knowledge\ncommon to both ladies.",
    "For Bella Biggs Emily Arundell\u2019s niece had married a Greek.",
    "And\nEmily Arundell\u2019s people who were what is known as \u201call service\npeople\u201d simply did not marry Greeks.",
    "By way of being obscurely comforting for of course such a matter\ncould not be referred to openly Miss Peabody said\n\u201cBella\u2019s husband\u2019s got brains.",
    "And charming manners\u201d\n\u201cHis manners are delightful\u201d agreed Miss Arundell.",
    "Moving out into the street Miss Peabody asked\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this about Theresa being engaged to young Donaldson\u201d\nMiss Arundell shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cYoung people are so casual nowadays.",
    "I\u2019m afraid it will have to be a\nrather long engagement\u2014that is if anything comes of it.",
    "He has no\nmoney.\u201d\n\u201cOf course Theresa has her own money\u201d said Miss Peabody.",
    "Miss Arundell said stiffly\n\u201cA man could not possibly wish to live on his wife\u2019s money.\u201d\nMiss Peabody gave a rich throaty chuckle.",
    "\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to mind doing it nowadays.",
    "You and I are out of\ndate Emily.",
    "What I can\u2019t understand is what the child sees in him.",
    "Of all\nthe nambypamby young men\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a clever doctor I believe.\u201d\n\u201cThose pincenez\u2014and that stiff way of talking In my young days\nwe\u2019d have called him a poor stick\u201d\n\n\fThere was a pause while Miss Peabody\u2019s memory diving into the\npast conjured up visions of dashing bewhiskered young men\u2026.",
    "She said with a sigh\n\u201cSend that young dog Charles along to see me\u2014if he\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.",
    "I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d\nThe two ladies parted.",
    "They had known each other for considerably over fifty years.",
    "Miss\nPeabody knew of certain regrettable lapses in the life of General\nArundell Emily\u2019s father.",
    "She knew just precisely what a shock Thomas\nArundell\u2019s marriage had been to his sisters.",
    "She had a very shrewd idea\nof certain troubles connected with the younger generation.",
    "But no word had ever passed between the two ladies on any of these\nsubjects.",
    "They were both upholders of family dignity family solidarity\nand complete reticence on family matters.",
    "Miss Arundell walked home Bob trotting sedately at her heels.",
    "To\nherself Emily Arundell admitted what she would never have admitted to\nanother human being her dissatisfaction with the younger generation of\nher family.",
    "Theresa for instance.",
    "She had no control over Theresa since the latter\nhad come into her own money at the age of twentyone.",
    "Since then the\ngirl had achieved a certain notoriety.",
    "Her picture was often in the papers.",
    "She belonged to a young bright goahead set in London\u2014a set that had\nfreak parties and occasionally ended up in the police courts.",
    "It was not\nthe kind of notoriety that Emily Arundell approved of for an Arundell.",
    "In\nfact she disapproved very much of Theresa\u2019s way of living.",
    "As regards\nthe girl\u2019s engagement her feelings were slightly confused.",
    "On the one\nhand she did not consider an upstart Dr. Donaldson good enough for an\nArundell.",
    "On the other she was uneasily conscious that Theresa was a\nmost unsuitable wife for a quiet country doctor.",
    "With a sigh her thoughts passed on to Bella.",
    "There was no fault to\nfind with Bella.",
    "She was a good woman\u2014a devoted wife and mother\nquite exemplary in behaviour\u2014and extremely dull But even Bella could\nnot be regarded with complete approval.",
    "For Bella had married a\nforeigner\u2014and not only a foreigner\u2014but a Greek.",
    "In Miss Arundell\u2019s\nprejudiced mind a Greek was almost as bad as an Argentine or a Turk.",
    "The fact that Dr. Tanios had a charming manner and was said to be\nextremely able to his profession only prejudiced the old lady slightly\nmore against him.",
    "She distrusted charm and easy compliments.",
    "For this\nreason too she found it difficult to be fond of the two children.",
    "They\n\n\fhad both taken after their father in looks\u2014there was really nothing\nEnglish about them.",
    "And then Charles\u2026.",
    "Yes Charles\u2026.",
    "It was no use blinding one\u2019s eyes to facts.",
    "Charles charming though\nhe was was not to be trusted\u2026.",
    "Emily Arundell sighed.",
    "She felt suddenly tired old depressed\u2026.",
    "She supposed that she couldn\u2019t last much longer\u2026.",
    "Her mind reverted to the will she had made some years ago.",
    "Legacies to the servants\u2014to charities\u2014and the main bulk of her\nconsiderable fortune to be divided equally between these her three\nsurviving relations\u2026.",
    "It still seemed to her that she had done the right and equitable thing.",
    "It just crossed her mind to wonder whether there might not be someway\nof securing Bella\u2019s share of the money so that her husband could not\ntouch it\u2026.She must ask Mr. Purvis.",

    "The brother and sister arrived first.",

    "Theresa put an indifferent young cheek against her withered one.",
    "\u201cHow are you Aunt Emily\u201d\nTheresa her aunt thought was looking far from well.",
    "Her face\nbeneath its plentiful makeup was slightly haggard and there were lines\nround her eyes.",
    "They had tea in the drawing room.",
    "Bella Tanios her hair inclined to\nstraggle in wisps from below the fashionable hat that she wore at the\nwrong angle stared at her cousin Theresa with a pathetic eagerness to\nassimilate and memorize her clothes.",
    "It was poor Bella\u2019s fate in life to be\npassionately fond of clothes without having any clothes sense.",
    "Theresa\u2019s\nclothes were expensive slightly bizarre and she herself had an exquisite\nfigure.",
    "Bella when she arrived in England from Smyrna had tried earnestly\nto copy Theresa\u2019s elegance at an inferior price and cut.",
    "Dr. Tanios who was a bigbearded jollylooking man was talking to\nMiss Arundell.",
    "His voice was warm and full\u2014an attractive voice that\n\n\fcharmed a listener almost against his or her will.",
    "Almost in spite of\nherself it charmed Miss Arundell.",
    "Miss Lawson was fidgeting a good deal.",
    "She jumped up and down\nhanding plates fussing over the tea table.",
    "Charles whose manners were\nexcellent rose more than once to help her but she expressed no\ngratitude.",
    "When after tea the party went out to make a tour of the garden\nCharles murmured to his sister\n\u201cLawson doesn\u2019t like me.",
    "Odd isn\u2019t it\u201d\nTheresa said mockingly\n\u201cVery odd.",
    "So there is one person who can withstand your fatal\nfascination\u201d\nCharles grinned\u2014an engaging grin\u2014and said\n\u201cLucky it\u2019s only Lawson\u2026.\u201d\nIn the garden Miss Lawson walked with Mrs. Tanios and asked her\nquestions about the children.",
    "Bella Tanios\u2019 rather drab face lighted up.",
    "She forgot to watch Theresa.",
    "She talked eagerly and animatedly.",
    "Mary\nhad said such a quaint thing on the boat\u2026.",
    "She found Minnie Lawson a most sympathetic listener.",
    "Presently a fairhaired young man with a solemn face and pincenez\nwas shown into the garden from the house.",
    "He looked rather\nembarrassed.",
    "Miss Arundell greeted him politely.",
    "Theresa said\n\u201cHullo Rex\u201d\nShe slipped an arm through his.",
    "They wandered away.",
    "Charles made a face.",
    "He slipped away to have a word with the\ngardener an ally of his from old days.",
    "When Miss Arundell reentered the house Charles was playing with\nBob.",
    "The dog stood at the top of the stairs his ball in his mouth his tail\ngently wagging.",
    "\u201cCome on old man\u201d said Charles.",
    "Bob sank down on his haunches nosed his ball slowly and slowly\nnearer the edge.",
    "As he finally bunted it over he sprang to his feet in great\nexcitement.",
    "The ball bumped slowly down the stairs.",
    "Charles caught it\nand tossed it up to him.",
    "Bob caught it neatly in his mouth.",
    "The\nperformance was repeated.",
    "\u201cRegular game of his\u201d said Charles.",
    "Emily Arundell smiled.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019ll go on for hours\u201d she said.",
    "She turned into the drawing room and Charles followed her.",
    "Bob\ngave a disappointed bark.",
    "Glancing through the window Charles said\n\u201cLook at Theresa and her young man.",
    "They are an odd couple\u201d\n\u201cYou think Theresa is really serious over this\u201d\n\u201cOh she\u2019s crazy about him\u201d said Charles with confidence.",
    "\u201cOdd\ntaste but there it is.",
    "I think it must be the way he looks at her as though\nshe were a scientific specimen and not a live woman.",
    "That\u2019s rather a\nnovelty for Theresa.",
    "Pity the fellow\u2019s so poor.",
    "Theresa\u2019s got expensive\ntastes.\u201d\nMiss Arundell said drily\n\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt she can change her way of living\u2014if she wants to\nAnd after all she has her own income.\u201d\n\u201cEh Oh yes yes of course.\u201d Charles shot an almost guilty look at\nher.",
    "That evening as the others were assembled in the drawing room\nwaiting to go in to dinner there was a scurry and a burst of profanity on\nthe stairs.",
    "Charles entered with his face rather red.",
    "\u201cSorry Aunt Emily am I late That dog of yours nearly made me\ntake the most frightful toss.",
    "He\u2019d left that ball of his on the top of the\nstairs.\u201d\n\u201cCareless little doggie\u201d cried Miss Lawson bending down to Bob.",
    "Bob looked at her contemptuously and turned his head away.",
    "\u201cI know\u201d said Miss Arundell.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s most dangerous.",
    "Minnie fetch the\nball and put it away.\u201d\nMiss Lawson hurried out.",
    "Dr. Tanios monopolized the conversation at the dinner table most of\nthe time.",
    "He told amusing stories of his life in Smyrna.",

    "Miss Lawson carrying wool spectacles\na large velvet bag and a book accompanied her employer to her bedroom\nchattering happily.",
    "\u201cReally most amusing Dr. Tanios.",
    "He is such good company Not\nthat I should care for that kind of life myself\u2026.One would have to boil\nthe water I expect\u2026.And goat\u2019s milk perhaps\u2014such a disagreeable\ntaste\u2014\u201d\nMiss Arundell snapped\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool Minnie.",
    "You told Ellen to call me at half past six\u201d\n\u201cOh yes Miss Arundell.",
    "I said no tea but don\u2019t you think it might be\nwiser\u2014You know the vicar at Southbridge\u2014a most conscientious man\ntold me distinctly that there was no obligation to come fasting\u2014\u201d\n\n\fOnce more Miss Arundell cut her short.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve never yet taken anything before Early Service and I\u2019m not\ngoing to begin now.",
    "You can do as you like.\u201d\n\u201cOh no\u2014I didn\u2019t mean\u2014I\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d\nMiss Lawson was flustered and upset.",
    "\u201cTake Bob\u2019s collar off\u201d said Miss Arundell.",
    "The slave hastened to obey.",
    "Still trying to please she said\n\u201cSuch a pleasant evening.",
    "They all seem so pleased to be here.\u201d\n\u201cHmph\u201d said Emily Arundell.",
    "\u201cAll here for what they can get.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear Miss Arundell\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy good Minnie I\u2019m not a fool whatever else I am I just wonder\nwhich of them will open the subject first.\u201d\nShe was not long left in doubt on that point.",
    "She and Miss Lawson\nreturned from attending Early Service just after nine.",

    "\u201cI know it is the fashion not to consider servants nowadays but that is\nnot the case in my house.\u201d\n\u201cGood.",
    "That\u2019s the true diehard spirit\u201d\nCharles helped himself to kidneys and sat down beside her.",
    "His grin as always was very attractive.",

    "Emboldened by this sign of favour\nCharles plunged.",
    "\u201cLook here Aunt Emily sorry to bother you but I\u2019m in the devil of a\nhole.",
    "Can you possibly help me out A hundred would do it.\u201d\nHis aunt\u2019s face was not encouraging.",

    "Nothing being handed out but\naffection\u2014and not so much of that.\u201d\n\u201cYou might have waited a bit\u201d said Theresa drily.",
    "Charles grinned again.",
    "\u201cI was afraid you or Tanios might get in ahead of me.",
    "I\u2019m sadly\nafraid Theresa my sweet that there\u2019ll be nothing doing this time.",
    "Old\nEmily is by no means a fool.\u201d\n\u201cI never thought she was.\u201d\n\u201cI even tried to put the wind up her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean\u201d asked his sister sharply.",

    "It\u2019s never a bit of\ngood sucking up to the old girl.",
    "She much prefers you to stand up to her.",
    "And after all I was only talking sense.",
    "We get the money when she dies\n\n\f\u2014she might just as well part with a little beforehand Otherwise the\ntemptation to help her out of the way might become overwhelming.\u201d\n\u201cDid she see your point\u201d asked Theresa her delicate mouth curling\nup scornfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not sure.",
    "She didn\u2019t admit it.",
    "Just thanked me rather nastily for\nmy advice and said she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 I said \u2018I\u2019ve warned you.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll remember it\u2019 she said.\u201d\nTheresa said angrily\n\u201cReally Charles you are an utter fool.\u201d\n\u201cDamn it all Theresa I was a bit ratty myself The old girl\u2019s rolling\n\u2014simply rolling.",
    "I bet she doesn\u2019t spend a tenth part of her income\u2014\nwhat has she got to spend it on anyway And here we are\u2014young able\nto enjoy life\u2014and to spite us she\u2019s capable of living to a hundred\u2026.I\nwant my fun now\u2026.So do you\u2026.\u201d\nTheresa nodded.",
    "She said in a low breathless voice\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand\u2014old people don\u2019t\u2026.they can\u2019t\u2026.They don\u2019t\nknow what it is to live\u201d\nBrother and sister were silent for some minutes.",
    "Charles got up.",
    "\u201cWell my love I wish you better success than I\u2019ve had.",
    "But I rather\ndoubt it.\u201d\nTheresa said\n\u201cI\u2019m rather counting on Rex to do the trick.",
    "If I can make old Emily\nrealize how brilliant he is and how it matters terrifically that he should\nhave his chance and not have to sink into a rut as a general practitioner\u2026\nOh Charles a few thousand of capital just at this minute would make all\nthe difference in the world to our lives\u201d\n\u201cHope you get it but I don\u2019t think you will.",
    "You\u2019ve got through a bit\ntoo much capital in riotous living in your time.",
    "I say Theresa you don\u2019t\nthink the dreary Bella or the dubious Tanios will get anything do you\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that money would be any good to Bella.",
    "She goes about\nlooking like a ragbag and her tastes are purely domestic.\u201d\n\u201cOh well\u201d said Charles vaguely.",
    "\u201cI expect she wants things for\nthose unprepossessing children of hers schools and plates for their front\nteeth and music lessons.",
    "And anyway it isn\u2019t Bella\u2014it\u2019s Tanios.",
    "I bet\nhe\u2019s got a nose for money all right Trust a Greek for that.",
    "You know he\u2019s\ngot through most of Bella\u2019s Speculated with it and lost it all.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll get something out of old Emily\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t if I can prevent him\u201d said Charles grimly.",
    "He left the room and wandered downstairs.",
    "Bob was in the hall.",
    "He\nfussed up to Charles agreeably.",
    "Dogs liked Charles.",
    "He ran towards the drawing room door and looked back at Charles.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u201d said Charles strolling after him.",
    "Bob hurried into the drawing room and sat down expectantly by a\nsmall bureau.",
    "Charles strolled over to him.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s it all about\u201d\nBob wagged his tail looked hard at the drawers of the bureau and\nuttered an appealing squeak.",
    "\u201cWant something that\u2019s in here\u201d\nCharles pulled open the top drawer.",
    "His eyebrows rose.",
    "\u201cDear dear\u201d he said.",
    "At one side of the drawer was a little pile of treasury notes.",
    "Charles picked up the bundle and counted them.",
    "With a grin he\nremoved three one pound notes and two ten shilling ones and put them in\nhis pocket.",
    "He replaced the rest of the notes carefully in the drawer\nwhere he had found them.",
    "\u201cThat was a good idea Bob\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYour Uncle Charles will be\nable at any rate to cover expenses.",
    "A little ready cash always comes in\nhandy.\u201d\nBob uttered a faint reproachful bark as Charles shut the drawer.",
    "\u201cSorry old man\u201d Charles apologized.",
    "He opened the next drawer.",
    "Bob\u2019s ball was in the corner of it.",
    "He took it out.",
    "\u201cHere you are.",
    "Enjoy yourself with it.\u201d Bob caught the ball trotted\nout of the room and presently bump bump bump was heard down the\nstairs.",
    "Charles strolled out into the garden.",
    "It was a fine sunny morning with\na scent of lilac.",
    "Miss Arundell had Dr. Tanios by her side.",
    "He was speaking of the\nadvantage of an English education\u2014a good education\u2014for children and\nhow deeply he regretted that he could not afford such a luxury for his\nown children.",
    "Charles smiled with satisfied malice.",
    "He joined in the conversation in\na lighthearted manner turning it adroitly into entirely different channels.",
    "Emily Arundell smiled at him quite amiably.",
    "He even fancied that\nshe was amused by his tactics and was subtly encouraging them.",
    "Charles\u2019 spirits rose.",
    "Perhaps after all before he left\u2014\nCharles was an incurable optimist.",
    "Dr. Donaldson called for Theresa in his car that afternoon and drove her\nto Worthem Abbey one of the local beauty spots.",
    "They wandered away\nfrom the Abbey itself into the woods.",
    "There Rex Donaldson told Theresa at length about his theories and\nsome of his recent experiments.",
    "She understood very little but listened in\na spellbound manner thinking to herself\n\u201cHow clever Rex is\u2014and how absolutely adorable\u201d\nHer fianc\u00e9 paused once and said rather doubtfully\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid this is dull stuff for you Theresa.\u201d\n\u201cDarling it\u2019s too thrilling\u201d said Theresa firmly.",
    "\u201cGo on.",
    "You take\nsome of the blood of the infected rabbit\u2014\u201d\nPresently Theresa said with a sigh\n\u201cYour work means a terrible lot to you my sweet.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally\u201d said Dr. Donaldson.",
    "It did not seem at all natural to Theresa.",
    "Very few of her friends did\nany work at all and if they did they made extremely heavy weather\nabout it.",
    "She thought as she had thought once or twice before how singularly\nunsuitable it was that she should have fallen in love with Rex Donaldson.",
    "Why did these things these ludicrous and amazing madnesses happen to\none A profitless question.",
    "This had happened to her.",
    "She frowned wondered at herself.",
    "Her crowd had been so gay\u2014so\ncynical.",
    "Love affairs were necessary to life of course but why take them\nseriously One loved and passed on.",
    "But this feeling of hers for Rex Donaldson was different it went\ndeeper.",
    "She felt instinctively that here there would be no passing on\u2026\nHer need of him was simple and profound.",
    "Everything about him\nfascinated her.",
    "His calmness and detachment so different from her own\nhectic grasping life the clear logical coldness of his scientific mind and\nsomething else imperfectly understood a secret force in the man masked\nby his unassuming slightly pedantic manner but which she nevertheless\nfelt and sensed instinctively.",
    "In Rex Donaldson there was genius\u2014and the fact that his profession\nwas the main preoccupation of his life and that she was only a part\u2014\nthough a necessary part\u2014of existence to him only heightened his\nattraction for her.",
    "She found herself for the first time in her selfish\npleasureloving life content to take second place.",
    "The prospect fascinated\nher.",
    "For Rex she would do anything\u2014anything\n\u201cWhat a damned nuisance money is\u201d she said petulantly.",
    "\u201cIf only\nAunt Emily were to die we could get married at once and you could\n\n\fcome to London and have a laboratory full of test tubes and guinea pigs\nand never bother anymore about children with mumps and old ladies\nwith livers.\u201d\nDonaldson said\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why your aunt shouldn\u2019t live for many years to\ncome\u2014if she\u2019s careful.\u201d\nTheresa said despondently\n\u201cI know that\u2026.\u201d\nIn the big doublebedded room with the oldfashioned oak furniture Dr.\nTanios said to his wife\n\u201cI think that I have prepared the ground sufficiently.",
    "It is now your\nturn my dear.\u201d\nHe was pouring water from the oldfashioned copper can into the\nrosepatterned china basin.",
    "Bella Tanios sat in front of the dressing table wondering why when\nshe combed her hair as Theresa did it should not look like Theresa\u2019s\nThere was a moment before she replied.",
    "Then she said\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I want\u2014to ask Aunt Emily for money.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for yourself Bella it\u2019s for the sake of the children.",
    "Our\ninvestments have been so unlucky.\u201d\nHis back was turned he did not see the swift glance she gave him\u2014a\nfurtive shrinking glance.",
    "She said with mild obstinacy\n\u201cAll the same I think I\u2019d rather not\u2026 Aunt Emily is rather difficult.",
    "She can be generous but she doesn\u2019t like being asked.\u201d Drying his hands\nTanios came across from the washstand.",
    "\u201cReally Bella it isn\u2019t like you to be so obstinate.",
    "After all what have\nwe come down here for\u201d\nShe murmured\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I never meant\u2014it wasn\u2019t to ask for money\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYet you agreed that the only hope if we are to educate the children\nproperly is for your aunt to come to the rescue.\u201d\nBella Tanios did not answer.",
    "She moved uneasily.",
    "But her face bore the mild mulish look that many clever husbands of\nstupid wives know to their cost.",
    "She said\n\u201cPerhaps Aunt Emily herself may suggest\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible but I\u2019ve seen no signs of it so far.\u201d\n\n\fBella said\n\u201cIf we could have brought the children with us.",
    "Aunt Emily couldn\u2019t\nhave helped loving Mary.",
    "And Edward is so intelligent.\u201d\nTanios said drily\n\u201cI don\u2019t think your aunt is a great child lover.",
    "It is probably just as\nwell the children aren\u2019t here.\u201d\n\u201cOh Jacob but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes yes my dear.",
    "I know your feelings.",
    "But these desiccated\nEnglish spinsters\u2014bah they are not human.",
    "We want to do the best we\ncan do we not for our Mary and our Edward To help us a little would\ninvolve no hardship to Miss Arundell.\u201d\nMrs. Tanios turned there was a flush in her cheeks.",
    "\u201cOh please please Jacob not this time.",
    "I\u2019m sure it would be unwise.",
    "I would so very very much rather not.\u201d\nTanios stood close behind her his arm encircled her shoulders.",
    "She\ntrembled a little and then was still\u2014almost rigid.",
    "He said and his voice was still pleasant\n\u201cAll the same Bella I think\u2014I think you will do what I ask\u2026 You\nusually do you know\u2014in the end\u2026 Yes I think you will do what I\nsay\u2026.\u201d\n\n\fThree\nTHE ACCIDENT\n\nIt was Tuesday afternoon.",
    "The side door to the garden was open.",
    "Miss\nArundell stood on the threshold and threw Bob\u2019s ball the length of the\ngarden path.",
    "The terrier rushed after it.",
    "\u201cJust once more Bob\u201d said Emily Arundell.",
    "\u201cA good one.\u201d\nOnce again the ball sped along the ground with Bob racing at full\nspeed in pursuit.",
    "Miss Arundell stooped down picked up the ball from where Bob laid\nit at her feet and went into the house Bob followed her closely.",
    "She shut\nthe side door went into the drawing room Bob still at her heels and put\nthe ball away in the drawer.",
    "She glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece.",
    "It was half past six.",
    "\u201cA little rest before dinner I think Bob.\u201d\nShe ascended the stairs to her bedroom.",
    "Bob accompanied her.",
    "Lying\non the big chintzcovered couch with Bob at her feet Miss Arundell\nsighed.",
    "She was glad that it was Tuesday and that her guests would be\ngoing tomorrow.",
    "It was not that this weekend had disclosed anything to\nher that she had not known before.",
    "It was more the fact that it had not\npermitted her to forget her own knowledge.",
    "She said to herself\n\u201cI\u2019m getting old I suppose\u2026\u201d And then with a little shock of\nsurprise \u201cI am old\u2026.\u201d\nShe lay with her eyes closed for half an hour then the elderly houseparlourmaid Ellen brought hot water and she rose and prepared for\ndinner.",
    "Dr. Donaldson was to dine with them that night.",
    "Emily Arundell\nwished to have an opportunity of studying him at close quarters.",
    "It still\nseemed to her a little incredible that the exotic Theresa should want to\nmarry this rather stiff and pedantic young man.",
    "It also seemed a little odd\nthat this stiff and pedantic young man should want to marry Theresa.",
    "She did not feel as the evening progressed that she was getting to\nknow Dr. Donaldson any better.",
    "He was very polite very formal and to\nher mind intensely boring.",
    "In her own mind she agreed with Miss\n\n\fPeabody\u2019s judgement.",
    "The thought flashed across her brain \u201cBetter stuff\nin our young days.\u201d\nDr. Donaldson did not stay late.",
    "He rose to go at ten o\u2019clock.",
    "After he\nhad taken his departure Emily Arundell herself announced that she was\ngoing to bed.",
    "She went upstairs and her young relations went up also.",
    "They all seemed somewhat subdued tonight.",
    "Miss Lawson remained\ndownstairs performing her final duties letting Bob out for his run\npoking down the fire putting the guard up and rolling back the hearth\nrug in case of fire.",
    "She arrived rather breathless in her employer\u2019s room about five\nminutes later.",
    "\u201cI think I\u2019ve got everything\u201d she said putting down wool workbag\nand a library book.",
    "\u201cI do hope the book will be all right.",
    "She hadn\u2019t got\nany of the ones on your list but she said she was sure you\u2019d like this\none.\u201d\n\u201cThat girl\u2019s a fool\u201d said Emily Arundell.",
    "\u201cHer taste in books is the\nworst I\u2019ve ever come across.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear.",
    "I\u2019m so sorry\u2014Perhaps I ought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNonsense it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Emily Arundell added kindly.",
    "\u201cI hope\nyou enjoyed yourself this afternoon.\u201d\nMiss Lawson\u2019s face lighted up.",
    "She looked eager and almost\nyouthful.",
    "\u201cOh yes thank you very much.",
    "So kind of you to spare me.",
    "I had the\nmost interesting time.",
    "We had the Planchette and really\u2014it wrote the\nmost interesting things.",
    "There were several messages\u2026 Of course its not\nquite the same thing as the sittings\u2026 Julia Tripp has been having a lot of\nsuccess with the automatic writing.",
    "Several messages from Those who\nhave Passed Over.",
    "It\u2014it really makes one feel so grateful\u2014that such\nthings should be permitted\u2026.\u201d\nMiss Arundell said with a slight smile\n\u201cBetter not let the vicar hear you.\u201d\n\u201cOh but indeed dear Miss Arundell I am convinced\u2014quite\nconvinced\u2014there can be nothing wrong about it.",
    "I only wish dear Mr.\nLonsdale would examine the subject.",
    "It seems to me so narrowminded\nto condemn a thing that you have not even investigated.",
    "Both Julia and\nIsabel Tripp are such truly spiritual women.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost too spiritual to be alive\u201d said Miss Arundell.",
    "She did not care much for Julia and Isabel Tripp.",
    "She thought their\nclothes ridiculous their vegetarian and uncooked fruit meals absurd and\ntheir manner affected.",
    "They were women of no traditions no roots\u2014in\n\n\ffact\u2014no breeding But she got a certain amount of amusement out of\ntheir earnestness and she was at bottom kindhearted enough not to\ngrudge the pleasure that their friendship obviously gave to poor Minnie.",
    "Poor Minnie Emily Arundell looked at her companion with mingled\naffection and contempt.",
    "She had had so many of these foolish middleaged women to minister to her\u2014all much the same kind fussy\nsubservient and almost entirely mindless.",
    "Really poor Minnie was looking quite excited tonight.",
    "Her eyes were\nshining.",
    "She fussed about the room vaguely touching things here and\nthere without the least idea of what she was doing her eyes all bright and\nshining.",
    "She stammered out rather nervously\n\u201cI\u2014I do wish you\u2019d been there\u2026 I feel you know that you\u2019re not\nquite a believer yet.",
    "But tonight there was a message\u2014for E.A.",
    "the\ninitials came quite definitely.",
    "It was from a man who had passed over\nmany years ago\u2014a very goodlooking military man\u2014Isabel saw him\nquite distinctly.",
    "It must have been dear General Arundell.",
    "Such a\nbeautiful message so full of love and comfort and how through patience\nall could be attained.\u201d\n\u201cThose sentiments sound very unlike papa\u201d said Miss Arundell.",
    "\u201cOh but our Dear Ones change so\u2014on the other side.",
    "Everything is\nlove and understanding.",
    "And then the Planchette spelt out something\nabout a key\u2014I think it was the key of the Boule cabinet\u2014could that be\nit\u201d\n\u201cThe key of the Boule cabinet\u201d Emily Arundell\u2019s voice sounded\nsharp and interested.",
    "\u201cI think that was it.",
    "I thought perhaps it might be important papers\u2014\nsomething of the kind.",
    "There was a wellauthenticated case where a\nmessage came to look in a certain piece of furniture and actually a will\nwas discovered there.\u201d\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a will in the Boule cabinet\u201d said Miss Arundell.",
    "She\nadded abruptly \u201cGo to bed Minnie.",
    "You\u2019re tired.",
    "So am I. We\u2019ll ask the\nTripps in for an evening soon.\u201d\n\u201cOh that will be nice Good night dear.",
    "Sure you\u2019ve got everything\nI hope you haven\u2019t been tired with so many people here.",
    "I must tell Ellen\nto air the drawing room very well tomorrow and shake out the curtains\u2014\nall this smoking leaves such a smell.",
    "I must say I think it\u2019s very good of\nyou to let them all smoke in the drawing room\u201d\n\u201cI must make some concessions to modernity\u201d said Emily Arundell.",
    "\u201cGood night Minnie.\u201d\n\n\fAs the other woman left the room Emily Arundell wondered if this\nspiritualistic business was really good for Minnie.",
    "Her eyes had been\npopping out of her head and she had looked so restless and excited.",
    "Odd about the Boule cabinet thought Emily Arundell as she got into\nbed.",
    "She smiled grimly as she remembered the scene of long ago.",
    "The\nkey that had come to light after papa\u2019s death and the cascade of empty\nbrandy bottles that had tumbled out when the cabinet had been unlocked\nIt was little things like that things that surely neither Minnie Lawson nor\nIsabel and Julia Tripp could possibly know which made one wonder\nwhether after all there wasn\u2019t something in this spiritualistic business\u2026.",
    "She felt wakeful lying on her big fourposter bed.",
    "Nowadays she\nfound it increasingly difficult to sleep.",
    "But she scorned Dr. Grainger\u2019s\ntentative suggestion of a sleeping draught.",
    "Sleeping draughts were for\nweaklings for people who couldn\u2019t bear a finger ache or a little\ntoothache or the tedium of a sleepless night.",
    "Often she would get up and wander noiselessly round the house\npicking up a book fingering an ornament rearranging a vase of flowers\nwriting a letter or two.",
    "In those midnight hours she had a feeling of the\nequal liveliness of the house through which she wandered.",
    "They were not\ndisagreeable those nocturnal wanderings.",
    "It was as though ghosts\nwalked beside her the ghosts of her sisters Arabella Matilda and Agnes\nthe ghost of her brother Thomas the dear fellow as he was before That\nWoman got hold of him Even the ghost of General Charles Laverton\nArundell that domestic tyrant with the charming manners who shouted\nand bullied his daughters but who nevertheless was an object of pride to\nthem with his experiences in the Indian Mutiny and his knowledge of the\nworld.",
    "What if there were days when he was \u201cnot quite so well\u201d as his\ndaughters put it evasively\nHer mind reverting to her niece\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Miss Arundell thought \u201cI\ndon\u2019t suppose he\u2019ll ever take to drink Calls himself a man and drank\nbarley water this evening Barley water And I opened papa\u2019s special\nport.\u201d\nCharles had done justice to the port all right.",
    "Oh if only Charles\nwere to be trusted.",
    "If only one didn\u2019t know that with him\u2014\nHer thoughts broke off\u2026 Her mind ranged over the events of the\nweekend\u2026.",
    "Everything seemed vaguely disquieting\u2026.",
    "She tried to put worrying thoughts out of her mind.",
    "It was no good.",
    "She raised herself on her elbow and by the light of the nightlight that\nalways burned in a little saucer she looked at the time.",
    "One o\u2019clock and she had never felt less like sleep.",
    "She got out of bed and put on her slippers and her warm dressing\ngown.",
    "She would go downstairs and just check over the weekly books\nready for the paying of them the following morning.",
    "Like a shadow she slipped from her room and along the corridor\nwhere one small electric bulb was allowed to burn all night.",
    "She came to the head of the stairs stretched out one hand to the\nbaluster rail and then unaccountably she stumbled tried to recover her\nbalance failed and went headlong down the stairs.",
    "The sound of her fall the cry she gave stirred the sleeping house to\nwakefulness.",
    "Doors opened lights flashed on.",
    "Miss Lawson popped out of her room at the head of the staircase.",
    "Uttering little cries of distress she pattered down the stairs.",
    "One by\none the others arrived\u2014Charles yawning in a resplendent dressing\ngown.",
    "Theresa wrapped in dark silk.",
    "Bella in a navyblue kimono her\nhair bristling with combs to \u201cset the wave.\u201d\nDazed and confused Emily Arundell lay in a crushed heap.",
    "Her\nshoulder hurt her and her ankle\u2014her whole body was a confused mass of\npain.",
    "She was conscious of people standing over her of that fool Minnie\nLawson crying and making ineffectual gestures with her hands of\nTheresa with a startled look in her dark eyes of Bella standing with her\nmouth open looking expectant of the voice of Charles saying from\nsomewhere\u2014very far away so it seemed\u2014\n\u201cIt\u2019s that damned dog\u2019s ball He must have left it here and she tripped\nover it.",
    "See Here it is\u201d\nAnd then she was conscious of authority putting the others aside\nkneeling beside her touching her with hands that did not fumble but\nknew.",
    "A feeling of relief swept over her.",
    "It would be all right now.",
    "Dr. Tanios was saying in firm reassuring tones\n\u201cNo it\u2019s all right.",
    "No bones broken\u2026 Just badly shaken and bruised\n\u2014and of course she\u2019s had a bad shock.",
    "But she\u2019s been very lucky that it\u2019s\nno worse.\u201d\nThen he cleared the others off a little and picked her up quite easily\nand carried her up to her bedroom where he had held her wrist for a\nminute counting then nodded his head sent Minnie who was still\n\n\fcrying and being generally a nuisance out of the room to fetch brandy\nand to heat water for a hot bottle.",
    "Confused shaken and racked with pain she felt acutely grateful to\nJacob Tanios in that moment.",
    "The relief of feeling oneself in capable\nhands.",
    "He gave you just that feeling of assurance\u2014of confidence\u2014that a\ndoctor ought to give.",
    "There was something\u2014something she couldn\u2019t quite get hold of\u2014\nsomething vaguely disquieting\u2014but she wouldn\u2019t think of it now.",
    "She\nwould drink this and go to sleep as they told her.",
    "But surely there was something missing\u2014someone.",

    "\u201cIt cannot be denied Poirot that\nyou have a noticeable personality.",
    "I have often wondered that it has not\nhindered you in your career.\u201d\nPoirot sighed.",
    "\u201cThat is because you have the mistaken idea implanted in your head\nthat a detective is necessarily a man who puts on a false beard and hides\nbehind a pillar The false beard it is vieux jeu and shadowing is only\ndone by the lowest branch of my profession.",
    "The Hercule Poirots my\nfriend need only to sit back in a chair and think.\u201d\n\u201cWhich explains why we are walking along this exceedingly hot\nstreet on an exceedingly hot morning.\u201d\n\u201cThat is very neatly replied Hastings.",
    "For once I admit you have\nmade the score off me.\u201d\nWe found Littlegreen House easily enough but a shock awaited us\u2014\na house agent\u2019s board.",
    "As we were staring at it a dog\u2019s bark attracted my attention.",
    "The bushes were thin at that point and the dog could be easily seen.",
    "He was a wirehaired terrier somewhat shaggy as to coat.",

    "It\u2019s\ndarned dull.",
    "I could do with a little conversation.\u201d\n\u201cHallo old man\u201d I said and shoved forward a fist.",

    "The dog seemed to be asking the same question.",
    "\u201cParbleu to Messrs\u2014what is it\u2014Messrs Gabler and Stretcher.\u201d\n\u201cThat does seem indicated\u201d I agreed.",

    "\u201cI desired a few particulars of Littlegreen House\u2014\u201d\nHe got no further.",
    "Mr. Gabler took command.",
    "\u201cAh Littlegreen House\u2014there\u2019s a property An absolute bargain.",

    "It\u2019ll be snapped up.",
    "Snapped up A member\nof parliament came to look at it only last Saturday.",

    "Make an offer and set the ball rolling.",
    "But you\ncan take it from me that there will be no difficulty in getting a price very\nnear the figure named.",
    "Why it\u2019s ridiculous To build a house like that\nnowadays would cost every penny of six thousand let alone the land\nvalue and the valuable frontages.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Arundell died very suddenly didn\u2019t she\u201d\n\u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t say that.",

    "Do you not see the importance of the point Miss Arundell\nis dead.\u201d\n\u201cBut my dear Poirot her death was perfectly natural and ordinary\nThere wasn\u2019t anything odd or unexplained about it.",
    "We have old Gabler\u2019s\nword for that.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWe have his word that Littlegreen House is a bargain at \u00a32850.",

    "It struck me that Gabler was all out to get the place sold\n\u2014it probably needs modernizing from top to toe.",
    "I\u2019d swear he\u2014or rather\nhis client\u2014will be willing to accept a very much lower figure than that.",
    "These large Georgian houses fronting right on the street must be the\ndevil to get rid of.\u201d\n\u201cEh bien then\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cDo not say \u2018But Gabler says so\u2019 as\nthough he were an inspired prophet who could not lie.\u201d\nI was about to protest further but at this minute we passed the\nthreshold of the George and with an emphatic \u201cChut\u201d Poirot put a\ndamper on further conversation.",

    "\u201cYes sir.",
    "I know where most of these are.",

    "He was sitting in an attitude of rapt\nattention close beside an elegant little table with two drawers in it.",

    "\u201cWhat does he want\u201d I asked.",

    "I\u2019m only remaining here as a convenience to Miss Lawson\nuntil the place is sold\u2014to look after everything.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",

    "\u201cBump bump BUMP.\u201d\nA monotonous sound increasing in volume and seeming to descend\nfrom above.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s Bob sir.\u201d She was smiling.",

    "It\u2019s a little game of his.\u201d\nAs we reached the bottom of the stairs a black rubber ball arrived\nwith a thud on the last step.",
    "I caught it and looked up.",
    "Bob was lying on\nthe top step his paws splayed out his tail gently wagging.",
    "I threw it up\nto him.",
    "He caught it neatly chewed it for a minute or two with evident\nrelish then laid it between his paws and gently edged it forward with his\nnose till he finally bunted it over and it bumped once more down the\nstairs Bob wagging his tail furiously as he watched its progress.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019ll stay like that for hours sir.",
    "Regular game of his.",
    "He\u2019d go on\nall day at it.",
    "That\u2019ll do now Bob.",
    "The gentlemen have got something else\nto do than play with you.\u201d\nA dog is a great promoter of friendly intercourse.",
    "Our interest and\nliking for Bob had quite broken down the natural stiffness of the good\nservant.",
    "As we went up to the bedroom floors our guide was talking\n\n\fquite garrulously as she gave us accounts of Bob\u2019s wonderful sagacity.",
    "The ball had been left at the foot of the stairs.",
    "As we passed him Bob\ngave us a look of deep disgust and stalked down in a dignified fashion to\nretrieve it.",
    "As we turned to the right I saw him slowly coming up again\nwith it in his mouth his gait that of an extremely old man forced by\nunthinking persons to exert himself unduly.",
    "As we went round the bedrooms Poirot began gradually to draw our\nconductress out.",
    "\u201cThere were four Miss Arundells lived here did they not\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cOriginally yes sir but that was before my time.",
    "There was only\nMiss Agnes and Miss Emily when I came and Miss Agnes died soon\nafterwards.",
    "She was the youngest of the family.",
    "It seemed odd she should\ngo before her sister.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose she was not so strong as her sister\u201d\n\u201cNo sir it\u2019s odd that.",
    "My Miss Arundell Miss Emily she was\nalways the delicate one.",
    "She\u2019d had a lot to do with doctors all her life.",
    "Miss Agnes was always strong and robust and yet she went first and\nMiss Emily who\u2019d been delicate from a child outlived all the family.",
    "Very odd the way things happen.\u201d\n\u201cAstonishing how often that is the case.\u201d\nPoirot plunged into I feel sure a wholly mendacious story of an\ninvalid uncle which I will not trouble to repeat here.",
    "It suffices to say\nthat it had its effect.",
    "Discussions of death and such matters do more to\nunlock the human tongue than any other subject.",

    "I was just wondering why he adopted such an untidy and\nuncharacteristic method instead of making a neat entry in his little\npocketbook when he handed the envelope to me saying\n\u201cThat is right is it not Perhaps you had better verify it.\u201d\nThere were no figures on the envelope.",
    "Instead was written \u201cWhen\nwe go upstairs again pretend to remember an appointment and ask if you\n\n\fcan telephone.",

    "\u201cI\nwonder if I might use your telephone if you have one.\u201d\n\u201cWhy certainly sir.",
    "It\u2019s in the little room off the hall.",
    "I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nShe bustled down with me indicating the instrument and then I got\nher to help me in finding a number in the telephone directory.",

    "Fortunately he was out and I was able to leave a message\nsaying it was unimportant and that I would ring up later\nWhen I emerged Poirot had descended the staircase and was standing\nin the hall.",

    "It worried her a lot.",
    "Why just as she\nwas dying she was delirious and she rambled on a lot about Bob and his\nball and something about a picture that was ajar.\u201d\n\u201cA picture that was ajar\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cOf course it didn\u2019t make sense sir but she was rambling you see.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment\u2014I must just go into the drawing room once more.\u201d\nHe wandered round the room examining the ornaments.",
    "In especial\none big jar with a lid on it seemed to attract him.",
    "It was not I fancy a\nparticularly good bit of china.",
    "A piece of Victorian humour\u2014it had on it\na rather crude picture of a bulldog sitting outside a front door with a\nmournful expression on its face.",
    "Below was written Out all night and no\nkey.",

    "\u201cIt is amusing that Is that\ntrue of our Master Bob Does he sometimes stay out all night\u201d\n\u201cVery occasional sir.",
    "Oh very occasional.",

    "And Bob came home about\nfive.",
    "Miss Lawson hurried down to let him in before he could make a\nnoise.",
    "She was afraid of waking up the mistress and hadn\u2019t told her Bob\nwas missing for fear of worrying her.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "She thought it was better Miss Arundell shouldn\u2019t be told\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what she said sir.",
    "She said \u2018He\u2019s sure to come back.",
    "He\nalways does but she might worry and that would never do.\u2019 So we didn\u2019t\nsay anything.\u201d\n\u201cWas Bob fond of Miss Lawson\u201d\n\u201cWell he was rather contemptuous of her if you know what I mean\nsir.",
    "Dogs can be.",
    "She was kind to him.",
    "Called him a good doggie and a\nnice doggie but he used to look at her kind of scornful like and he didn\u2019t\npay any attention at all to what she told him to do.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d he said.",
    "Suddenly he did something which startled me.",
    "He pulled a letter from his pocket\u2014the letter he had received this\nmorning.",
    "\u201cEllen\u201d he said \u201cdo you know anything about this\u201d\nThe change that came over Ellen\u2019s face was remarkable.",

    "\u201cWell\u201d she ejaculated.",
    "\u201cI never did\u201d\nThe observation lacked coherency perhaps but it left no doubt of\nEllen\u2019s meaning.",
    "Gathering her wits about her she said slowly\n\u201cAre you the gentleman that letter was written to then\u201d\n\u201cI am.",
    "I am Hercule Poirot.\u201d\n\n\fLike most people Ellen had not glanced at the name on the order\nPoirot had held out to her on his arrival.",
    "She nodded her head slowly.",
    "\u201cThat was it\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cHercules Poirot.\u201d She added an S to the\nChristian name and sounded the T of the surname.",
    "\u201cMy word\u201d she exclaimed.",
    "\u201cCook will be surprised.\u201d\nPoirot said quickly\n\u201cWould it not be advisable perhaps for us to go to the kitchen and\nthere in company with your friend we could talk this matter over\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014if you don\u2019t mind sir.\u201d\nEllen sounded just a little doubtful.",
    "This particular social dilemma\nwas clearly new to her.",
    "But Poirot\u2019s matteroffact manner reassured her\nand we departed forthwith to the kitchen Ellen elucidating the situation\nto a large pleasantfaced woman who was just lifting a kettle from a gas\nring.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll never believe it Annie.",
    "This is actually the gentleman that\nletter was to.",
    "You know the one I found in the blotter.\u201d\n\u201cYou must remember I am in the dark\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you\nwill tell me how the letter came to be posted so late in the day\u201d\n\u201cWell sir to tell the truth I didn\u2019t know what to do.",
    "Neither of us did\ndid we\u201d\n\u201cIndeed we didn\u2019t\u201d the cook confirmed.",
    "\u201cYou see sir when Miss Lawson was turning out things after the\nmistress\u2019s death a good lot of things were given away or thrown away.",
    "Among them was a little papierm\u00e2ch\u00e9 I think they call it blotter.",
    "Very\npretty it was with a lily of the valley on it.",
    "The mistress always used it\nwhen she wrote in bed.",
    "Well Miss Lawson didn\u2019t want it so she gave it\nto me along with a lot of other little odds and ends that had belonged to\nthe mistress.",
    "I put it away in a drawer and it wasn\u2019t till yesterday that I\ntook it out.",
    "I was going to put some new blotting paper in it so that it was\nready for me to use.",
    "There was a sort of pocket inside and I just slipped\nmy hand in it when what should I find but a letter in the mistress\u2019s\nhandwriting tucked away.",
    "\u201cWell as I say I didn\u2019t know rightly what to do about it.",
    "It was the\nmistress\u2019s hand all right and I saw as she\u2019d written it and slipped it in\nthere waiting to post it the next day and then she\u2019d forgot which is the\nkind of thing she did many a time poor dear.",
    "Once it was a dividend\nwarrant to her bank and no one could think where it had got to and at\nlast it was found pushed right back in the pigeonholes of the desk.\u201d\n\u201cWas she untidy\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh no sir just the opposite.",
    "She was always putting things away\nand clearing them up.",
    "That was half the trouble.",
    "If she\u2019d left things about\nit would really have been better.",
    "It was their being tidied away and then\nforgotten that was always happening.\u201d\n\u201cThings like Bob\u2019s ball for instance\u201d asked Poirot with a smile.",
    "The sagacious terrier had just trotted in from outdoors and greeted us\nanew in a very friendly manner.",
    "\u201cYes indeed sir.",
    "As soon as Bob finished playing with his ball she\u2019d\nput it away.",
    "But that was all right because it had its own place\u2014in the\ndrawer I showed you.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "But I interrupted you.",
    "Pray go on.",
    "You discovered the letter in\nthe blotter\u201d\n\u201cYes sir that was the way of it and I asked Annie what she thought\nI\u2019d better do.",
    "I didn\u2019t like to put it in the fire\u2014and of course I couldn\u2019t\ntake upon myself to open it and neither Annie nor I could see that it was\nany business of Miss Lawson\u2019s so after we\u2019d talked it over a bit I just\nput a stamp on it and ran out to the postbox and posted it.\u201d\nPoirot turned slightly to me.",
    "\u201cVoil\u00e0\u201d he murmured.",
    "I could not help saying maliciously\n\u201cAmazing how simple an explanation can be\u201d\nI thought he looked a little crestfallen and rather wished I hadn\u2019t\nbeen so quick to try and rub it in.",
    "He turned again to Ellen.",
    "\u201cAs my friend says How simple an explanation can be You\nunderstand when I received a letter dated over two months ago I was\nsomewhat surprised.\u201d\n\u201cYes I suppose you must have been sir.",
    "We didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d\n\u201cAlso\u2014\u201d Poirot coughed.",
    "\u201cI am in a little dilemma.",
    "That letter you\nsee\u2014it was a commission with which Miss Arundell wished to entrust\nme.",
    "A matter of a somewhat private character.\u201d He cleared his throat\nimportantly.",
    "\u201cNow that Miss Arundell is dead I am in some doubt how to\nact.",
    "Would Miss Arundell have wished me to undertake the commission\nin these circumstances or not It is difficult\u2014very difficult.\u201d\nBoth women were looking at him respectfully.",
    "\u201cI shall have I think to consult Miss Arundell\u2019s lawyer.",
    "She had a\nlawyer did she not\u201d\nEllen answered quickly.",
    "\u201cOh yes sir.",
    "Mr. Purvis from Harchester.\u201d\n\u201cHe knew all her affairs\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI think so sir.",

    "\u201cDay after Bank Holiday it was.",
    "I remember that well.",

    "A quick look of intelligence passed across\nEllen\u2019s face.",
    "She turned to the cook who gave her back an answering\nglance.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019ll be Mr. Charles\u201d she said.",

    "I could see no point in\nthese continued questions.",
    "He got the explanation of his mystery and in\nmy opinion the sooner he retired with dignity the better.",
    "The thought seemed to go from my brain to his.",
    "\u201cEh bien\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis information you have given me is very\nhelpful.",

    "\u201cYou must include Miss Arundell herself.",
    "How do you know she may\nnot have stretched that thread across the stairs in order to trip up some\nother members of the house party\u201d\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",

    "You permit me to trespass for a few\nmoments of your valuable time\u201d\nWith a faint imitation of Poirot\u2019s manner she replied\n\u201cEnchanted M. Poirot.",
    "Pray sit down.\u201d\nPoirot sat rather gingerly on a low square easy chair.",
    "I took an\nupright one of webbing and chromium.",

    "But where exactly do I come\nin\u201d\n\u201cI hoped mademoiselle that you might consent to answer a few\nquestions.\u201d\n\u201cQuestions What about\u201d\n\u201cQuestions of a family nature.\u201d\nAgain I saw her eyes widen.",
    "\u201cThat sounds rather pompous Supposing you give me a specimen.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "Can you tell me the present address of your brother\nCharles\u201d\nThe eyes narrowed again.",
    "Her latent energy was less apparent.",
    "It was\nas though she withdrew into a shell.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t.",
    "We don\u2019t correspond much.",
    "I rather think he has\nleft England.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\nPoirot was silent for a minute or two.",
    "\u201cWas that all you wanted to know\u201d\n\u201cOh I have other questions.",
    "For one\u2014are you satisfied with the way\nin which your aunt disposed of her fortune For another\u2014how long have\nyou been engaged to Dr. Donaldson\u201d\n\u201cYou do jump about don\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cEh bien\u201d\n\u201cEh bien\u2014since we are so foreign\u2014my answer to both those\nquestions is they are none of your business Ca ne vous regarde pas M.\nHercule Poirot.\u201d\nPoirot studied her for a moment or two attentively.",
    "Then with no\ntrace of disappointment he got up.",
    "\u201cSo it is like that Ah well perhaps it is not surprising.",
    "Allow me\nmademoiselle to congratulate you upon your French accent.",
    "And to wish\nyou a very good morning.",
    "Come Hastings.\u201d\nWe had reached the door when the girl spoke.",

    "But the only\nlawyers I know are respectable men Their advice is that the will holds\ngood in law and that any attempts to contest it will be useless expense.\u201d\n\u201cBut you do not believe them.\u201d\n\u201cI believe there is always a way to do things\u2014if you don\u2019t mind\nbeing unscrupulous and are prepared to pay.",

    "Made a kind of speech.",

    "Then she said that neither I nor Theresa were fit people to\nbe trusted with money.",
    "We would only gamble and squander it away.",
    "Therefore she finished up she had made a new will and had left the\nentire estate to Miss Lawson.",
    "\u2018She is a fool\u2019 said Aunt Emily \u2018but she is\na faithful soul.",

    "I thought it was what you might call a gesture on the old bean\u2019s\npart.",
    "She wanted to frighten us all.",
    "I\u2019d a pretty shrewd suspicion that\nafter a few weeks or perhaps months she\u2019d tear that will up.",
    "She was\npretty hot on family Aunt Emily.",
    "And as a matter of fact I believe that\u2019s\nwhat she would have done if she hadn\u2019t died so confoundedly suddenly.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt is an interesting idea that.\u201d\nHe remained silent for a minute or two then went on\n\u201cCould anyone Miss Lawson for instance have overheard your\nconversation\u201d\n\u201cRather.",
    "We weren\u2019t speaking any too low.",

    "Poirot said slowly\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t think you could have forgotten Miss Arundell.\u201d\nThen he turned sharply to Charles.",
    "\u201cLet me be quite clear on one point.",
    "Did Miss Arundell tell you she\nwas about to alter her will or did she tell you specifically that she had\naltered it\u201d\nCharles said quickly\n\u201cOh she was quite definite.",
    "As a matter of fact she showed me the\nwill.\u201d\nPoirot leaned forward.",
    "His eyes opened wide.",
    "\u201cThis is very important.",
    "You say that Miss Arundell actually showed\nyou the will\u201d\nCharles gave a sudden schoolboy wriggle\u2014a rather disarming action.",
    "Poirot\u2019s gravity made him quite uncomfortable.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cShe showed it to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou can swear definitely to that\u201d\n\u201cOf course I can.\u201d Charles looked nervously at Poirot.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t see\nwhat is so significant about that.\u201d\nThere was a sudden brusque movement from Theresa.",
    "She had risen\nand was standing by the mantelpiece.",
    "She quickly lit another cigarette.",
    "\u201cAnd you mademoiselle\u201d Poirot whirled suddenly round on her.",
    "\u201cDid your aunt say nothing of importance to you during that weekend\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.",
    "She was\u2014quite amiable.",
    "That is as amiable as she\nusually was.",
    "Lectured me a bit about my way of life and all that.",
    "But\nthen she always did.",
    "She seemed perhaps a bit more jumpy than usual.\u201d\nPoirot said smiling\n\u201cI suppose mademoiselle that you were more taken up with your\nfianc\u00e9\u201d\nTheresa said sharply\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there.",
    "He was away he\u2019d gone to some medical\ncongress.\u201d\n\u201cYou had not seen him then since the Easter weekend Was that the\nlast time you had seen him\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014on the evening before we left he came to dinner.\u201d\n\u201cYou had not\u2014excuse me\u2014had any quarrel with him then\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\u201cI only thought seeing that he was away on your second visit\u2014\u201d\nCharles broke in\n\u201cAh but you see that second weekend was rather unpremeditated.",
    "We went down on the spur of the moment.\u201d\n\u201cReally\u201d\n\u201cOh let\u2019s have the truth\u201d said Theresa wearily.",
    "\u201cYou see Bella and\nher husband were down the weekend before\u2014fussing over Aunt Emily\nbecause of her accident.",
    "We thought they might steal a march on us\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe thought\u201d said Charles with a grin \u201cthat we\u2019d better show a little\nconcern for Aunt Emily\u2019s health too.",
    "Really though the old lady was\nmuch too sharp to be taken in by the dutiful attention stunt.",
    "She knew\nvery well how much it was worth.",
    "No fool Aunt Emily.\u201d\nTheresa laughed suddenly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty story isn\u2019t it All of us with our tongues hanging out for\nmoney.\u201d\n\u201cWas that the case with your cousin and her husband\u201d\n\u201cOh yes Bella\u2019s always hard up.",
    "Rather pathetic the way she tries to\ncopy all my clothes at about an eighth of the price.",
    "Tanios speculated\nwith her money I believe.",
    "They\u2019re hard put to it to make both ends meet.",
    "They\u2019ve got two children and want to educate them in England.\u201d\n\u201cCan you perhaps give me their address\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re staying at the Durham Hotel in Bloomsbury.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is she like your cousin\u201d\n\u201cBella Well she\u2019s a dreary woman.",
    "Eh Charles\u201d\n\u201cOh definitely a dreary woman.",
    "Rather like an earwig.",
    "She\u2019s a\ndevoted mother.",
    "So are earwigs I believe.\u201d\n\u201cAnd her husband.\u201d\n\u201cTanios Well he looks a bit odd but he\u2019s really a thoroughly nice\nfellow.",
    "Clever amusing and a thorough good sport.\u201d\n\u201cYou agree mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cWell I must admit I prefer him to Bella.",
    "He\u2019s a damned clever\ndoctor I believe.",
    "All the same I wouldn\u2019t trust him very far.\u201d\n\u201cTheresa\u201d said Charles \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d\nHe put an arm round her.",
    "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust me.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone who trusted you my sweet would be mentally deficient\u201d\nsaid Theresa kindly.",
    "The brother and sister moved apart and looked at Poirot.",
    "Poirot bowed and moved to the door.",
    "\u201cI am\u2014as you say\u2014on the job It is difficult but mademoiselle is\nright.",
    "There is always a way.",
    "Ah by the way this Miss Lawson is she\nthe kind that might conceivably lose her head under crossexamination in\ncourt\u201d\nCharles and Theresa exchanged glances.",
    "\u201cI should say\u201d said Charles \u201cthat a really bullying K.C.",
    "could make\nher say black was white\u201d\n\u201cThat\u201d said Poirot \u201cmay be very useful.\u201d\nHe skipped out of the room and I followed him.",
    "In the hall he picked\nup his hat moved to the front door opened it and shut it again quickly\nwith a bang.",
    "Then he tiptoed to the door of the sitting room and\nunblushingly applied his ear to the crack.",
    "At whatever school Poirot was\neducated there were clearly no unwritten rules about eavesdropping.",
    "I\n\n\fwas horrified but powerless.",
    "I made urgent signs to Poirot but he took no\nnotice.",
    "And then clearly in Theresa Arundell\u2019s deep vibrant voice there\ncame two words\n\u201cYou fool\u201d\nThere was the noise of footsteps along the passage and Poirot quickly\nseized me by the arm opened the front door and passed through closing\nit noiselessly behind him.",
    "Fifteen\nMISS LAWSON\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I said.",

    "It was only I who listened It was not you\nwho put your ear to the crack.",
    "On the contrary you stood bolt upright\nlike a soldier.\u201d\n\u201cBut I heard just the same.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.",
    "Mademoiselle was hardly whispering.\u201d\n\u201cBecause she thought that we had left the flat.\u201d\n\u201cYes we practised a little deception there.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cYour moral attitude is irreproachable But let us not repeat\nourselves.",
    "This conversation has occurred on previous occasions.",
    "You\nare about to say that it is not playing the game.",
    "And my reply is that\nmurder is not a game.\u201d\n\u201cBut there is no question of murder here.\u201d\n\u201cDo not be sure of that.\u201d\n\u201cThe intention yes perhaps.",
    "But after all murder and attempted\nmurder are not the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cMorally they are exactly the same thing.",
    "But what I meant was are\nyou so sure that it is only attempted murder that occupies our attention\u201d\nI stared at him.",

    "\u201cNow the facts of the case were as follows\nwere they not Miss Arundell had a sum of money in a drawer\u2014\u201d\nHe paused.",
    "Miss Lawson hastened to confirm his statement.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014from the Bank.",
    "For the wages you know and the books.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd how much was missing exactly\u201d\n\u201cFour pound notes.",
    "No no I am wrong three pound notes and two\ntenshilling notes.",
    "One must be exact I know very exact in such\nmatters.\u201d Miss Lawson looked at him earnestly and absentmindedly\nknocked her pincenez a little farther awry.",
    "Her rather prominent eyes\nseemed to goggle at him.",
    "\u201cThank you Miss Lawson.",
    "I see you have an excellent business\nsense.\u201d\nMiss Lawson bridled a little and uttered a deprecatory laugh.",
    "\u201cMiss Arundell suspected no doubt with reason that her nephew\nCharles was responsible for this theft\u201d went on Poirot.",
    "\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough there was no particular evidence to show who actually\ntook the money\u201d\n\u201cOh but it must have been Charles Mrs. Tanios wouldn\u2019t do such a\nthing and her husband was quite a stranger and wouldn\u2019t have known\nwhere the money was kept\u2014neither of them would.",
    "And I don\u2019t think\nTheresa Arundell would dream of such a thing.",
    "She\u2019s got plenty of\nmoney and always so beautifully dressed.\u201d\n\u201cIt might have been one of the servants\u201d Poirot suggested.",
    "Miss Lawson seemed horrified by the idea.",
    "\u201cOh no indeed neither Ellen nor Annie would have dreamed of\nsuch a thing.",
    "They are both most superior women and absolutely honest I\nam sure.\u201d\nPoirot waited a minute or two.",
    "Then he said\n\u201cI wonder if you can give me any idea\u2014I am sure you can for if\nanyone possessed Miss Arundell\u2019s confidence you did\u2014\u201d\nMiss Lawson murmured confusedly\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know about that I\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d but she was clearly\nflattered.",
    "\u201cI feel that you will be able to help me.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure if I can\u2014anything I can do\u2014\u201d\nPoirot went on\n\u201cThis is in confidence\u2014\u201d\nA sort of owlish expression appeared on Miss Lawson\u2019s face.",
    "The\nmagical words \u201cin confidence\u201d seemed to be a kind of Open Sesame.",
    "\u201cHave you any idea of the reason which caused Miss Arundell to\nalter her will\u201d\n\u201cHer will Oh\u2014her will\u201d\nMiss Lawson seemed slightly taken aback.",
    "Poirot said watching her closely\n\u201cIt is true is it not that she made a new will shortly before her death\nleaving all her fortune to you\u201d\n\u201cYes but I knew nothing about it.",
    "Nothing at all\u201d Miss Lawson was\nshrill in protest.",
    "\u201cIt was the greatest surprise to me A wonderful\nsurprise of course So good of dear Miss Arundell.",
    "And she never even\ngave me a hint.",
    "Not the smallest hint I was so taken aback when Mr.\nPurvis read it out I didn\u2019t know where to look or whether to laugh or\ncry I assure you M. Poirot the shock of it\u2014the shock you know.",
    "The\nkindness\u2014the wonderful kindness of dear Miss Arundell.",
    "Of course I\u2019d\nhoped perhaps for just a little something\u2014perhaps just a teeny teeny\nlegacy\u2014though of course there was no reason she should have left me\neven that.",
    "I\u2019d not been with her so very long.",
    "But this\u2014it was like\u2014it\nwas like a fairy story Even now I can\u2019t quite believe in it if you know\nwhat I mean.",
    "And sometimes\u2014well sometimes\u2014I don\u2019t feel altogether\ncomfortable about it.",
    "I mean\u2014well I mean\u2014\u201d\nShe knocked off her pincenez picked them up fumbled with them\nand went on even more incoherently.",
    "\u201cSometimes I feel that\u2014well flesh and blood is flesh and blood after\nall and I don\u2019t feel quite comfortable at Miss Arundell\u2019s leaving all her\nmoney away from her family.",
    "I mean it doesn\u2019t seem right does it Not\nall of it.",
    "Such a large fortune too Nobody had any idea But\u2014well\u2014it\ndoes make one feel uncomfortable\u2014and everyone saying things you\nknow\u2014and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve never been an illnatured woman I mean I\nwouldn\u2019t have dreamed of influencing Miss Arundell in any way And\nit\u2019s not as though I could either.",
    "Truth to tell I was always just a teeny\nweeny bit afraid of her She was so sharp you know so inclined to jump\non you.",
    "And quite rude sometimes \u2018Don\u2019t be a downright fool\u2019 she\u2019d\nsnap.",
    "And really after all I had my feelings and sometimes I\u2019d feel quite\nupset\u2026 And then to find out that all the time she\u2019d really been fond of\nme\u2014well it was very wonderful wasn\u2019t it Only of course as I say\nthere\u2019s been a lot of unkindness and really in some ways one feels\u2014I\nmean well it does seem a little hard doesn\u2019t it on some people\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that you would prefer to relinquish the money\u201d asked\nPoirot.",
    "Just for a moment I fancied a flicker of some quite different\nexpression showed itself in Miss Lawson\u2019s dull pale blue eyes.",
    "I\nimagined that just for a moment a shrewd intelligent woman sat there\ninstead of an amiable foolish one.",
    "She said with a little laugh.",
    "\u201cWell\u2014of course there is the other side of it too\u2026 I mean there are\ntwo sides to every question.",
    "What I say is Miss Arundell meant me to\nhave the money.",
    "I mean if I didn\u2019t take it I should be going against her\nwishes.",
    "And that wouldn\u2019t be right either would it\u201d\n\u201cIt is a difficult question\u201d said Poirot shaking his head.",
    "\u201cYes\nindeed I have worried over it a great deal.",
    "Mrs. Tanios\u2014Bella\u2014she is\nsuch a nice woman\u2014and those dear children I mean I feel sure Miss\nArundell wouldn\u2019t have wanted her to\u2014I feel you see that dear Miss\nArundell intended me to use my discretion.",
    "She didn\u2019t want to leave any\nmoney outright to Bella because she was afraid that man would get hold\nof it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat man\u201d\n\u201cHer husband.",
    "You know Mr. Poirot the poor girl is quite under his\nthumb.",
    "She does anything he tells her.",
    "I daresay she\u2019d murder someone if\nhe told her to And she\u2019s afraid of him.",
    "I\u2019m quite sure she\u2019s afraid of\nhim.",
    "I\u2019ve seen her look simply terrified once or twice.",
    "Now that isn\u2019t\nright Mr. Poirot\u2014you can\u2019t say that\u2019s right.\u201d\nPoirot did not say so.",
    "Instead he inquired\n\u201cWhat sort of man is Dr. Tanios\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Miss Lawson hesitating \u201che\u2019s a very pleasant man.\u201d\nShe stopped doubtfully.",
    "\u201cBut you don\u2019t trust him\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014no I don\u2019t.",
    "I don\u2019t know\u201d went on Miss Lawson doubtfully\n\u201cthat I\u2019d trust any man very much Such dreadful things one hears And\nall their poor wives go through It\u2019s really terrible Of course Dr. Tanios\npretends to be very fond of his wife and he\u2019s quite charming to her.",
    "His\nmanners are really delightful.",
    "But I don\u2019t trust foreigners.",
    "They\u2019re so\nartful And I\u2019m quite sure dear Miss Arundell didn\u2019t want her money to\nget into his hands\u201d\n\u201cIt is hard on Miss Theresa Arundell and Mr. Charles Arundell also\nto be deprived of their inheritance\u201d Poirot suggested.",
    "A spot of colour came into Miss Lawson\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cI think Theresa has quite as much money as is good for her\u201d she\nsaid sharply.",
    "\u201cShe spends hundreds of pounds on her clothes alone.",
    "And\nher underclothing\u2014it\u2019s wicked When one thinks of so many nice wellbred girls who have to earn their own living\u2014\u201d\nPoirot gently completed the sentence.",
    "\u201cYou think it would do no harm for her to earn hers for a bit\u201d\nMiss Lawson looked at him solemnly.",
    "\u201cIt might do her a lot of good\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIt might bring her to her\nsenses.",
    "Adversity teaches us many things.\u201d\nPoirot nodded slowly.",
    "He was watching her intently.",
    "\u201cAnd Charles\u201d\n\u201cCharles doesn\u2019t deserve a penny\u201d said Miss Lawson sharply.",
    "\u201cIf\nMiss Arundell cut him out of her will it was for a very good cause\u2014\nafter his wicked threats.\u201d\n\u201cThreats\u201d Poirot\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "\u201cYes threats.\u201d\n\u201cWhat threats When did he threaten her\u201d\n\u201cLet me see it was\u2014yes of course it was at Easter.",
    "Actually on\nEaster Sunday\u2014which made it even worse\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he say\u201d\n\u201cHe asked her for money and she refused to give it him And then he\ntold her that it wasn\u2019t wise of her.",
    "He said if she kept up that attitude he\nwould\u2014now what was the phrase\u2014a very vulgar American one\u2014oh\nyes he said he would bump her off\u201d\n\u201cHe threatened to bump her off\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did Miss Arundell say\u201d\n\u201cShe said \u2018I think you\u2019ll find Charles that I can look after myself.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou were in the room at the time\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly in the room\u201d said Miss Lawson after a momentary\npause.",
    "\u201cQuite quite\u201d said Poirot hastily.",
    "\u201cAnd Charles what did he say to\nthat\u201d\n\u201cHe said \u2018Don\u2019t be too sure.\u2019\u201d\nPoirot said slowly\n\u201cDid Miss Arundell take this threat seriously\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know\u2026 She didn\u2019t say anything to me about it\u2026 But\nthen she wouldn\u2019t do that anyway.\u201d\nPoirot said quietly\n\u201cYou knew of course that Miss Arundell was making a new will\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "I\u2019ve told you it was a complete surprise.",
    "I never dreamt\u2014\u201d\nPoirot interrupted.",
    "\u201cYou did not know the contents.",
    "But you knew the fact\u2014that there\nwas a will being made\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014I suspected\u2014I mean her sending for the lawyer when she\nwas laid up\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "That was after she had a fall was it not\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes Bob\u2014Bob was the dog\u2014he had left his ball at the top of the\nstairs\u2014and she tripped over it and fell.\u201d\n\u201cA nasty accident.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes why she might easily have broken her leg or her arm.",
    "The\ndoctor said so.\u201d\n\u201cShe might quite easily have been killed.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed.\u201d\nHer answer seemed quite natural and frank.",
    "Poirot said smiling\n\u201cI think I saw Master Bob at Littlegreen House.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes I expect you did.",
    "He\u2019s a dear little doggie.\u201d Nothing annoys\nme more than to hear a sporting terrier called a dear little doggie.",
    "No\nwonder I thought that Bob despised Miss Lawson and refused to do\nanything she told him.",
    "\u201cAnd he is very intelligent\u201d went on Poirot.",
    "\u201cOh yes very.\u201d\n\u201cHow upset he\u2019d be if he knew he had nearly killed his mistress\u201d\nMiss Lawson did not answer.",
    "She merely shook her head and sighed.",
    "Poirot asked\n\u201cDo you think it possible that that fall influenced Miss Arundell to\nremake her will\u201d\nWe were getting perilously near the bone here I thought but Miss\nLawson seemed to find the question quite natural.",
    "\u201cYou know\u201d she said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder if you weren\u2019t right.",
    "It\ngave her a shock\u2014I\u2019m sure of that.",
    "Old people never like to think there\u2019s\nany chance of their dying.",
    "But an accident like that makes one think.",
    "Or\nperhaps she might have had a premonition that her death wasn\u2019t far off.\u201d\nPoirot said casually\n\u201cShe was in fairly good health was she not\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "Very well indeed.\u201d\n\u201cHer illness must have come on very suddenly\u201d\n\u201cOh it did.",
    "It was quite a shock.",
    "We had had some friends that\nevening\u2014\u201d Miss Lawson paused.",
    "\u201cYour friends the Misses Tripp.",
    "I have met those ladies.",
    "They are\nquite charming.\u201d\nMiss Lawson\u2019s face flushed with pleasure.",
    "\u201cYes aren\u2019t they Such cultured women Such wide interests And\nso very spiritual They told you perhaps\u2014about our sittings I expect\nyou are a sceptic\u2014but indeed I wish I could tell you the inexpressible\njoy of getting into touch with those who\u2019ve passed over\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI am sure of it.",
    "I am sure of it.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know Mr. Poirot my mother has spoken to me\u2014more than\nonce.",
    "It is such a joy to know that one\u2019s dear ones are still thinking of\none and watching over one.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes I can well understand that\u201d said Poirot gently.",
    "\u201cAnd was\nMiss Arundell also a believer\u201d\nMiss Lawson\u2019s face clouded over a little.",
    "\u201cShe was willing to be convinced\u201d she said doubtfully.",
    "\u201cBut I do not\nthink she always approached the matter in the right frame of mind.",
    "She\nwas sceptical and unbelieving\u2014and once or twice her attitude attracted a\nmost undesirable type of spirit There were some very ribald messages\u2014\nall due I am convinced to Miss Arundell\u2019s attitude.\u201d\n\u201cI should think very likely due to Miss Arundell\u201d agreed Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut on that last evening\u2014\u201d continued Miss Lawson \u201cperhaps Isabel\nand Julia told you\u2014there were distinct phenomena.",
    "Actually the\nbeginning of a materialization.",
    "Ectoplasm\u2014you know what ectoplasm is\nperhaps\u201d\n\u201cYes yes I am acquainted with its nature.\u201d\n\u201cIt proceeds you know from the medium\u2019s mouth in the form of a\nribbon and builds itself up into a form.",
    "Now I am convinced Mr. Poirot\nthat unknown to herself Miss Arundell was a medium.",
    "On that evening I\ndistinctly saw a luminous ribbon issuing from dear Miss Arundell\u2019s\nmouth Then her head became enveloped in a luminous mist.\u201d\n\u201cMost interesting\u201d\n\u201cAnd then unfortunately Miss Arundell was suddenly taken ill and\nwe had to break up the s\u00e9ance.\u201d\n\u201cYou sent for the doctor\u2014when\u201d\n\u201cFirst thing the following morning.\u201d\n\u201cDid he think the matter grave\u201d\n\u201cWell he sent in a hospital nurse the following evening but I think\nhe hoped she would pull through.\u201d\n\u201cThe\u2014excuse me\u2014the relatives were not sent for\u201d\nMiss Lawson flushed.",
    "\u201cThey were notified as soon as possible\u2014that is to say when Dr.\nGrainger pronounced her to be in danger.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the cause of the attack Something she had eaten\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t think there was anything in particular.",
    "Dr. Grainger said\nshe hadn\u2019t been quite as careful in diet as she should have been.",

    "He began\n\u201cIt is in reference to the death of your aunt the late Miss Emily\nArundell.\u201d\nWas I beginning to fancy things or did a look of alarm spring up\nsuddenly in those pale prominent eyes.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cMiss Arundell\u201d said Poirot \u201caltered her will a very short time\nbefore she died.",
    "By the new will everything was left to Miss Wilhelmina\n\n\fLawson.",
    "What I want to know Mrs. Tanios is whether you will join with\nyour cousins Miss Theresa and Mr. Charles Arundell in trying to\ncontest that will\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d Mrs. Tanios drew a deep breath.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\npossible is it I mean my husband consulted a lawyer and he seemed to\nthink that it was better not to attempt it.\u201d\n\u201cLawyers madame are cautious people.",
    "Their advice is usually to\navoid litigation at all costs\u2014and no doubt they are usually right.",
    "But\nthere are times when it pays to take a risk.",
    "I am not a lawyer myself and\ntherefore I look at the matter differently.",
    "Miss Arundell\u2014Miss Theresa\nArundell I mean\u2014is prepared to fight.",
    "What about you\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014Oh I really don\u2019t know.\u201d She twisted her fingers nervously\ntogether \u201cI should have to consult my husband.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly you must consult your husband before anything definite is\nundertaken.",
    "But what is your own feeling in the matter\u201d\n\u201cWell really I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mrs. Tanios looked more worried than\never.",
    "\u201cIt depends so much on my husband.\u201d\n\u201cBut you yourself what do you think madame\u201d\nMrs. Tanios frowned then she said slowly\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I like the idea very much.",
    "It seems\u2014it seems rather\nindecent doesn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cDoes it madame\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014after all if Aunt Emily chose to leave her money away from\nher family I suppose we must put up with it.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not feel aggrieved in the matter then\u201d\n\u201cOh yes I do.\u201d A quick flush showed in her cheeks.",
    "\u201cI think it was\nmost unfair Most unfair And so unexpected.",
    "It was so unlike Aunt\nEmily.",
    "And so very unfair on the children.\u201d\n\u201cYou think it is very unlike Miss Emily Arundell\u201d\n\u201cI think it was extraordinary of her\u201d\n\u201cThen isn\u2019t it possible that she was not acting of her own free will\nDon\u2019t you think that perhaps she was being unduly influenced\u201d\nMrs. Tanios frowned again.",
    "Then she said almost unwillingly\n\u201cThe difficult thing is that I can\u2019t see Aunt Emily being influenced by\nanybody She was such a decided old lady.\u201d\nPoirot nodded approvingly.",
    "\u201cYes what you say is true.",
    "And Miss Lawson is hardly what one\nwould describe as a strong character.\u201d\n\u201cNo she\u2019s a nice creature really\u2014rather foolish perhaps\u2014but very\nvery kind.",
    "That\u2019s partly why I feel\u2014\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes madame\u201d said Poirot as she paused.",
    "Mrs. Tanios twisted her fingers nervously again as she answered\n\u201cWell that it would be mean to try and upset the will.",
    "I feel certain\nthat it wasn\u2019t in any way Miss Lawson\u2019s doing\u2014I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be quite\nincapable of scheming and intriguing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAgain I agree with you madame.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I feel that to go to law would be\u2014well would be\nundignified and spiteful and besides it would be very expensive\nwouldn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cIt would be expensive yes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd probably useless too.",
    "But you must speak to my husband about\nit.",
    "He\u2019s got a much better head for business than I have.\u201d\nPoirot waited a minute or two then he said\n\u201cWhat reason do you think lay behind the making of that will\u201d\nA quick colour rose in Mrs. Tanios\u2019 cheeks as she murmured\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea.\u201d\n\u201cMadame I have told you I am not a lawyer.",
    "But you have not asked\nme what my profession is.\u201d\nShe looked at him inquiringly.",
    "\u201cI am a detective.",
    "And a short time before she died Miss Emily\nArundell wrote me a letter.\u201d\nMrs. Tanios leaned forward her hands pressed themselves together.",
    "\u201cA letter\u201d she asked abruptly.",
    "\u201cAbout my husband\u201d\nPoirot watched her for a minute or two then he said slowly\n\u201cI am afraid I am not at liberty to answer that question.\u201d\n\u201cThen it was about my husband.\u201d Her voice rose slightly.",
    "\u201cWhat did\nshe say I can assure you Mr.\u2014er\u2014I don\u2019t know your name.\u201d\n\u201cPoirot is my name.",
    "Hercule Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cI can assure you Mr. Poirot that if anything was said in that letter\nagainst my husband it was entirely untrue I know too who will have\ninspired that letter And that is another reason why I would rather have\nnothing to do with any action undertaken by Theresa and Charles\nTheresa has never liked my husband.",
    "She has said things I know she has\nsaid things Aunt Emily was prejudiced against my husband because he\nwas not an Englishman and she may therefore have believed things that\nTheresa said about him.",
    "But they are not true Mr. Poirot you can take\nmy word for that\u201d\n\u201cMother\u2014I\u2019ve finished my letter.\u201d\nMrs. Tanios turned quickly.",
    "With an affectionate smile she took the\nletter the little girl held out to her.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s very nice darling very nice indeed.",
    "And that\u2019s a beautiful\ndrawing of Mickey Mouse.\u201d\n\u201cWhat shall I do now Mother\u201d\n\u201cWould you like to get a nice postcard with a picture on it Here\u2019s the\nmoney.",
    "You go to the gentleman in the hall and choose one and then you\ncan send it to Selim.\u201d\nThe child moved away.",
    "I remembered what Charles Arundell had\nsaid.",
    "Mrs. Tanios was evidently a devoted wife and mother.",
    "She was\nalso as he had said a little like an earwig.",
    "\u201cThat is your only child madame\u201d\n\u201cNo I have a little boy also.",
    "He is out with his father at the moment.\u201d\n\u201cThey did not accompany you to Littlegreen House on your visits\u201d\n\u201cOh yes sometimes but you see my aunt was rather old and\nchildren were inclined to worry her.",
    "But she was very kind and always\nsent them out nice presents at Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see when did you last see Miss Emily Arundell\u201d\n\u201cI think it was about ten days before she died.\u201d\n\u201cYou and your husband and your two cousins were all down there\ntogether were you not\u201d\n\u201cOh no that was the weekend before\u2014at Easter.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you and your husband were down there the weekend after\nEaster as well\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Miss Arundell was in good health and spirits then\u201d\n\u201cYes she seemed much as usual.\u201d\n\u201cShe was not ill in bed\u201d\n\u201cShe was laid up with a fall she had had but she came downstairs\nagain while we were there.\u201d\n\u201cDid she say anything to you about having made a new will\u201d\n\u201cNo nothing at all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd her manner to you was quite unchanged\u201d\nA slightly longer pause this time before Mrs. Tanios said\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nI feel sure that at that moment Poirot and I had the same conviction.",
    "Mrs. Tanios was lying\nPoirot paused a minute and then said\n\u201cPerhaps I should explain that when I asked if Miss Arundell\u2019s\nmanner to you was unchanged I was not using the \u2018you\u2019 plural.",
    "I\nreferred to you personally.\u201d\nMrs. Tanios replied quickly.",
    "\u201cOh I see.",
    "Aunt Emily was very nice to me.",
    "She gave me a little\npearl and diamond brooch and she sent ten shillings to each of the\nchildren.\u201d\nThere was no constraint in her manner now.",
    "The words came freely\nwith a rush.",
    "\u201cAnd as regards your husband\u2014was there no change in her manner\nto him\u201d\nThe constraint had returned.",
    "Mrs. Tanios did not meet Poirot\u2019s eye as\nshe replied\n\u201cNo of course not\u2014why should there be\u201d\n\u201cBut since you suggest that your cousin Theresa Arundell might have\ntried to poison your aunt\u2019s mind\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe did I\u2019m sure she did\u201d Mrs. Tanios leant forward eagerly.",
    "\u201cYou\nare quite right.",
    "There was a change Aunt Emily was suddenly far more\ndistant to him.",
    "And she behaved very oddly.",
    "There was a special\ndigestive mixture he recommended\u2014even went to the trouble of getting\nher some\u2014going to the chemist and having it made up.",
    "She thanked him\nand all that\u2014but rather stiffly and later I actually saw her pouring the\nbottle down the sink\u201d\nHer indignation was quite fierce.",
    "Poirot\u2019s eyes flickered.",
    "\u201cA very odd procedure\u201d he said.",
    "His voice was carefully unexcited.",
    "\u201cI thought it most ungrateful\u201d said Dr. Tanios\u2019 wife hotly.",
    "\u201cAs you say elderly ladies distrust foreigners sometimes\u201d said\nPoirot.",
    "\u201cI am sure they think that English doctors are the only doctors in\nthe world.",
    "Insularity accounts for a lot.\u201d\n\u201cYes I suppose it does.\u201d Mrs. Tanios looked slightly mollified.",
    "\u201cWhen do you return to Smyrna madame\u201d\n\u201cIn a few weeks\u2019 time.",
    "My husband\u2014ah here is my husband and\nEdward with him.\u201d\n\n\fSeventeen\nDR. TANIOS\n\nI must say that my first sight of Dr. Tanios was rather a shock.",
    "I had been\nimbuing him in my mind with all sorts of sinister attributes.",
    "I had been\npicturing to myself a darkbearded foreigner with a swarthy aspect and a\nsinister cast of countenance.",
    "Instead I saw a rotund jolly brownhaired browneyed man.",
    "And\nthough it is true he had a beard it was a modest brown affair that made\nhim look more like an artist.",
    "He spoke English perfectly.",
    "His voice had a pleasant timbre and\nmatched the cheerful good humour of his face.",
    "\u201cHere we are\u201d he said smiling to his wife.",
    "\u201cEdward has been\npassionately thrilled by his first ride in the tube.",
    "He has always been in\nbuses until today.\u201d\nEdward was not unlike his father in appearance but both he and his\nlittle sister had a definitely foreignlooking appearance and I understood\nwhat Miss Peabody had meant when she described them as rather\nyellowlooking children.",
    "The presence of her husband seemed to make Mrs. Tanios nervous.",
    "Stammering a little she introduced Poirot to him.",
    "Me she ignored.",
    "Dr. Tanios took up the name sharply.",
    "\u201cPoirot Monsieur Hercule Poirot But I know that name well And\nwhat brings you to us M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cIt is the affair of a lady lately deceased.",

    "\u201cMy wife\u2019s aunt Yes\u2014what of her\u201d\nPoirot said slowly\n\u201cCertain matters have arisen in connection with her death\u2014\u201d\nMrs. Tanios broke in suddenly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s about the will Jacob.",
    "M. Poirot has been conferring with\nTheresa and Charles.\u201d\nSome of the tensity went out of Dr. Tanios\u2019 attitude.",
    "He dropped into\na chair.",
    "\u201cAh the will An iniquitous will\u2014but there it is not my business I\nsuppose.\u201d\nPoirot sketched an account of his interview with the two Arundells\nhardly a truthful one I may say and cautiously hinted at a fighting\nchance of upsetting the will.",
    "\u201cYou interest me M. Poirot very much.",
    "I may say I am of your\nopinion.",
    "Something could be done.",
    "I actually went as far as to consult a\nlawyer on the subject but his advice was not encouraging.",
    "Therefore\u2014\u201d\nhe shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cLawyers as I have told your wife are cautious people.",
    "They do not\nlike taking chances.",
    "But me I am different And you\u201d\nDr. Tanios laughed\u2014a rich rollicking laugh.",
    "\u201cOh I\u2019d take a chance all right Often have haven\u2019t I Bella old\ngirl\u201d He smiled across at her and she smiled back at him\u2014but in a\nrather mechanical manner I thought.",
    "He turned his attention back to Poirot.",
    "\u201cI am not a lawyer\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut in my opinion it is perfectly clear\nthat that will was made when the old lady was not responsible for what\nshe was doing.",
    "That Lawson woman is both clever and cunning.\u201d\nMrs. Tanios moved uneasily.",
    "Poirot looked at her quickly.",
    "\u201cYou do not agree madame\u201d\nShe said rather weakly\n\u201cShe has always been very kind.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t call her clever.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s been kind to you\u201d said Dr. Tanios \u201cbecause she had nothing\nto fear from you my dear Bella.",
    "You\u2019re easily taken in\u201d\nHe spoke goodhumouredly but his wife flushed.",
    "\u201cWith me it was different\u201d he went on.",
    "\u201cShe didn\u2019t like me.",
    "And she\nmade no bones about showing it I\u2019ll give you an instance.",
    "The old lady\nhad a fall down the stairs when we were staying there.",
    "I insisted on\ncoming back the following weekend to see how she was.",
    "Miss Lawson\ndid her utmost to prevent us.",
    "She didn\u2019t succeed but she was annoyed\nabout it I could see.",
    "The reason was clear.",
    "She wanted the old lady to\nherself.\u201d\nAgain Poirot turned to the wife.",
    "\u201cYou agree madame\u201d\nHer husband did not give her time to answer.",
    "\u201cBella\u2019s too kindhearted\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou won\u2019t get her to impute bad\nmotives to anybody.",
    "But I\u2019m quite sure I was right.",
    "I\u2019ll tell you another\nthing M. Poirot.",
    "The secret of her ascendency over old Miss Arundell\nwas spiritualism That\u2019s how it was done depend upon it\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou think so\u201d\n\u201cSure of it my dear fellow.",
    "I\u2019ve seen a lot of that sort of thing.",
    "It gets\nhold of people.",
    "You\u2019d be amazed Especially anyone of Miss Arundell\u2019s\nage.",
    "I\u2019d be prepared to bet that that\u2019s how the suggestion came.",
    "Some\nspirit\u2014possibly her dead father\u2014ordered her to alter her will and leave\nher money to the Lawson woman.",
    "She was in bad health\u2014credulous\u2014\u201d\nThere was a very faint movement from Mrs. Tanios.",
    "Poirot turned to\nher.",
    "\u201cYou think it possible\u2014yes\u201d\n\u201cSpeak up Bella\u201d said Dr. Tanios.",
    "\u201cTell us your views\u201d\nHe looked at her encouragingly.",
    "Her quick look back at him was an\nodd one.",
    "She hesitated then said\n\u201cI know so little about these things.",
    "I daresay you\u2019re right Jacob.\u201d\n\u201cDepend upon it I\u2019m right eh M. Poirot\u201d\nPoirot nodded his head.",
    "\u201cIt may be\u2014yes.\u201d Then he said \u201cYou were down at Market Basing I\nthink the weekend before Miss Arundell\u2019s death\u201d\n\u201cWe were down at Easter and again the weekend after\u2014that is right.\u201d\n\u201cNo no I meant the weekend after that\u2014on the 26th.",
    "You were there\non the Sunday I think\u201d\n\u201cOh Jacob were you\u201d Mrs. Tanios looked at him wideeyed.",
    "He turned quickly.",
    "\u201cYes you remember I just ran down in the afternoon.",
    "I told you\nabout it.\u201d\nBoth Poirot and I were looking at her.",
    "Nervously she pushed her hat a\nlittle farther back on her head.",
    "\u201cSurely you remember Bella\u201d her husband continued.",
    "\u201cWhat a\nterrible memory you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\u201cOf course\u201d she apologized a thin smile on her face.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s quite true\nI have a shocking memory.",
    "And it\u2019s nearly two months ago now.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Theresa Arundell and Mr. Charles Arundell were there then I\nbelieve\u201d said Poirot.",

    "\u201cYes mon ami she changed her mind.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d \u201cI wish I knew\u201d he murmured.",

    "I was eager to learn\nwhat he made of the various members of the Arundell family.",
    "\u201cWell Poirot\u201d I asked impatiently.",
    "With a look of reproof Poirot turned his whole attention to the menu.",
    "When he had ordered he leaned back in his chair broke his roll of bread\nin half and said with a slightly mocking intonation\n\u201cWell Hastings\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think of them now you\u2019ve seen them all\u201d\nPoirot replied slowly.",
    "\u201cMa foi I think they are an interesting lot Really this case is an\nenchanting study It is how do you say the box of surprises Look how\neach time I say \u2018I got a letter from Miss Arundell before she died\u2019\nsomething crops up.",
    "From Miss Lawson I learn about the missing\nmoney.",
    "Mrs. Tanios says at once \u2018About my husband\u2019 Why about her\nhusband Why should Miss Arundell write to me Hercule Poirot about\nDr. Tanios\u201d\n\u201cThat woman has something on her mind\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cYes she knows something.",
    "But what Miss Peabody tells us that\nCharles Arundell would murder his grandmother for twopence Miss\nLawson says that Mrs. Tanios would murder anyone if her husband told\nher to do so.",
    "Dr. Tanios says that Charles and Theresa are rotten to the\ncore and he hints that their mother was a murderess and says apparently\ncarelessly that Theresa is capable of murdering anyone in cold blood.",
    "\u201cThey have a pretty opinion of each other all these people Dr.\nTanios thinks or says he thinks that there was undue influence.",
    "His\nwife before he came in evidently did not think so.",
    "She does not want to\ncontest the will at first.",
    "Later she veers round.",
    "See you Hastings\u2014it is a\npot that boils and seethes and every now and then a significant fact\ncomes to the surface and can be seen.",
    "There is something in the depths\nthere\u2014yes there is something I swear it by my faith as Hercule Poirot\nI swear it\u201d\nI was impressed in spite of myself by his earnestness.",
    "After a minute or two I said\n\u201cPerhaps you are right but it seems too vague\u2014so nebulous.\u201d\n\u201cBut you agree with me that there is something\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d I said hesitatingly.",
    "\u201cI believe I do.\u201d\nPoirot leaned across the table.",
    "His eyes bored into mine.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014you have changed.",
    "You are no longer amused superior\u2014\nindulging me in my academic pleasures.",
    "But what is it that has\nconvinced you It is not my excellent reasoning\u2014non ce n\u2019est pas \u00e7a\nBut something\u2014something quite independent\u2014has produced an effect\non you.",
    "Tell me my friend what is it that has suddenly induced you to\ntake this matter seriously\u201d\n\u201cI think\u201d I said slowly \u201cit was Mrs. Tanios.",
    "She looked\u2014she looked\n\u2014afraid.\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAfraid of me\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014no not of you.",
    "It was something else.",
    "She spoke so quietly and\nsensibly to begin with\u2014a natural resentment at the terms of the will\nperhaps but otherwise she seemed so resigned and willing to leave\nthings as they are.",
    "It seemed the natural attitude of a wellbred but rather\napathetic woman.",
    "And then that sudden change\u2014the eagerness with\nwhich she came over to Dr. Tanios\u2019 point of view.",
    "The way she came out\ninto the hall after us\u2014the\u2014almost furtive way\u2014\u201d\nPoirot nodded encouragingly.",
    "\u201cAnd another little thing which you may not have noticed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI notice everything\u201d\n\u201cI mean the point about her husband\u2019s visit to Littlegreen House on\nthat last Sunday.",
    "I could swear she knew nothing of it\u2014that it was the\nmost complete surprise to her\u2014and yet she took her cue so quickly\u2014\nagreed that he had told her about it and that she had forgotten.",
    "I\u2014I didn\u2019t\nlike it Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cYou are quite right Hastings\u2014it was significant that.\u201d\n\u201cIt left an ugly impression of\u2014of fear on me.\u201d\nPoirot nodded his head slowly.",
    "\u201cYou felt the same\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014that impression was definitely in the air.\u201d He paused and then\nwent on.",
    "\u201cAnd yet you liked Tanios did you not You found him an\nagreeable man openhearted goodnatured genial.",
    "Attractive in spite of\nyour insular prejudice against the Argentines the Portuguese and the\nGreeks\u2014a thoroughly congenial personality\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d I admitted.",
    "\u201cI did.\u201d\nIn the silence that ensued I watched Poirot.",
    "Presently I said\n\n\f\u201cWhat are you thinking of Poirot\u201d\n\u201cI am reflecting on various people handsome young Norman Gale\nbluff hearty Evelyn Howard the pleasant Dr. Sheppard the quiet\nreliable Knighton.\u201d\nFor a moment I did not understand these references to people who\nhad figured in past cases.",
    "\u201cWhat of them\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cThey were all delightful personalities\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cMy goodness Poirot do you really think that Tanios\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "Do not jump to conclusions Hastings.",
    "I am only pointing\nout that one\u2019s own personal reactions to people are singularly unsafe\nguides.",
    "One must go not by one\u2019s feelings but by facts.\u201d\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cFacts are not our strong suit.",
    "No no Poirot don\u2019t go\nover it all again\u201d\n\u201cI will be brief my friend do not fear.",
    "To begin with we have quite\ncertainly a case of attempted murder.",
    "You admit that do you not\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cI do.\u201d\nI had up to now been a little sceptical over Poirot\u2019s as I thought\nsomewhat fanciful reconstruction of the events on the night of Easter\nTuesday.",
    "I was forced to admit however that his deductions were\nperfectly logical.",
    "\u201cTr\u00e8s bien.",
    "Now one cannot have attempted murder without a\nmurderer.",
    "One of the people present on that evening was a murderer\u2014in\nintention if not in fact.\u201d\n\u201cGranted.\u201d\n\u201cThen that is our starting point\u2014a murderer.",
    "We make a few\ninquiries\u2014we as you would say\u2014stir the mud\u2014and what do we get\u2014\nseveral very interesting accusations uttered apparently casually in the\ncourse of conversations.\u201d\n\u201cYou think they were not casual\u201d\n\u201cImpossible to tell at the moment Miss Lawson\u2019s innocent seeming\nway of bringing out the fact that Charles threatened his aunt may have\nbeen quite innocent or it may not.",
    "Dr. Tanios\u2019 remarks about Theresa\nArundell may have absolutely no malice behind them but be merely a\nphysician\u2019s genuine opinion.",
    "Miss Peabody on the other hand is\nprobably quite genuine in her opinion of Charles Arundell\u2019s proclivities\n\u2014but it is after all merely an opinion.",
    "So it goes on.",
    "There is a saying\nis there not a nigger in the woodpile.",
    "Eh bien that is just what I find\nhere.",
    "There is\u2014not a nigger\u2014but a murderer in our woodpile.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to know is what you yourself really think Poirot\u201d\n\n\f\u201cHastings\u2014Hastings\u2014I do not permit myself to \u2018think\u2019\u2014not that is\nin the sense that you are using the word.",
    "At the moment I only make\ncertain reflections.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as\u201d\n\u201cI consider the question of motive.",
    "What are the likely motives for\nMiss Arundell\u2019s death Clearly the most obvious one is gain.",
    "Who\nwould have gained by Miss Arundell\u2019s death\u2014if she had died on Easter\nTuesday\u201d\n\u201cEveryone\u2014with the exception of Miss Lawson.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\u201cWell at any rate one person is automatically cleared.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cIt would seem so.",
    "But the interesting\nthing is that the person who would have gained nothing if death had\noccurred on Easter Tuesday gains everything when death occurs two\nweeks later.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you getting at Poirot\u201d I said slightly puzzled.",
    "\u201cCause and effect my friend cause and effect.\u201d\nI looked at him doubtfully.",
    "He went on\n\u201cProceed logically What exactly happened\u2014after the accident\u201d\nI hate Poirot in this mood.",
    "Whatever one says is bound to be wrong I\nproceeded with intense caution.",
    "\u201cMiss Arundell was laid up in bed.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "With plently of time to think.",
    "What next\u201d\n\u201cShe wrote to you.\u201d Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYes she wrote to me.",
    "And the letter was not posted.",
    "A thousand\npities that.\u201d\n\u201cDo you suspect that there was something fishy about that letter not\nbeing posted\u201d\nPoirot frowned.",
    "\u201cThere Hastings I have to confess that I do not know.",
    "I think\u2014in\nview of everything I am almost sure\u2014that the letter was genuinely\nmislaid.",
    "I believe\u2014but I cannot be sure\u2014that the fact that such a letter\nwas written was unsuspected by anybody.",
    "Continue\u2014what happened\nnext\u201d\nI reflected.",
    "\u201cThe lawyer\u2019s visit\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014she sent for her lawyer and in due course he arrived.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she made a new will\u201d I continued.",
    "\u201cPrecisely.",
    "She made a new and very unexpected will.",
    "Now in view\nof that will we have to consider very carefully a statement made to us by\nEllen.",
    "Ellen said if you remember that Miss Lawson was particularly\nanxious that the news that Bob had been out all night should not get to\nMiss Arundell\u2019s ears.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014oh I see\u2014no I don\u2019t.",
    "Or do I begin to see what you are\nhinting at\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI doubt it\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut if you do you realize I hope the\nsupreme importance of that statement.\u201d\nHe fixed me with a fierce eye.",
    "\u201cOf course.",
    "Of course\u201d I said hurriedly.",
    "\u201cAnd then\u201d continued Poirot \u201cvarious other things happen.",
    "Charles\nand Theresa come for the weekend and Miss Arundell shows the new\nwill to Charles\u2014or so he says.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you believe him\u201d\n\u201cI only believe statements that are checked.",
    "Miss Arundell does not\nshow it to Theresa.\u201d\n\u201cBecause she thought Charles would tell her.\u201d\n\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t.",
    "Why doesn\u2019t he\u201d\n\u201cAccording to Charles himself he did tell her.\u201d\n\u201cTheresa said quite positively that he didn\u2019t\u2014a very interesting and\nsuggestive little clash.",
    "And when we depart she calls him a fool.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting fogged Poirot\u201d I said plaintively.",
    "\u201cLet us return to the sequence of events.",
    "Dr. Tanios comes down on\nSunday\u2014possibly without the knowledge of his wife.\u201d\n\u201cI should say certainly without her knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cLet us say probably.",
    "To proceed Charles and Theresa leave on the\nMonday.",
    "Miss Arundell is in good health and spirits.",
    "She eats a good\ndinner and sits in the dark with the Tripps and the Lawson.",
    "Towards the\nend of the s\u00e9ance she is taken ill. She retires to bed and dies four days\nlater and Miss Lawson inherits all her money and Captain Hastings says\nshe died a natural death\u201d\n\u201cWhereas Hercule Poirot says she was given poison in her dinner on\nno evidence at all\u201d\n\u201cI have some evidence Hastings.",
    "Think over our conversation with\nthe Misses Tripp.",
    "And also one statement that stood out from Miss\nLawson\u2019s somewhat rambling conversation.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean the fact that she had curry for dinner Curry would\nmask the taste of a drug.",
    "Is that what you meant\u201d\nPoirot said slowly\n\n\f\u201cYes the curry has a certain significance perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u201d I said \u201cif what you advance in defiance of all the medical\nevidence is true only Miss Lawson or one of the maids could have\nkilled her.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder.\u201d\n\u201cOr the Tripp women Nonsense.",
    "I can\u2019t believe that All these\npeople are palpably innocent.\u201d\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cRemember this Hastings stupidity\u2014or even silliness for that\nmatter\u2014can go hand in hand with intense cunning.",
    "And do not forget the\noriginal attempt at murder.",
    "That was not the handiwork of a particularly\nclever or complex brain.",
    "It was a very simple little murder suggested by\nBob and his habit of leaving the ball at the top of the stairs.",
    "The thought\nof putting a thread across the stairs was quite simple and easy\u2014a child\ncould have thought of it\u201d\nI frowned.",
    "\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI mean that what we are seeking to find here is just one thing\u2014the\nwish to kill.",
    "Nothing more than that.\u201d\n\u201cBut the poison must have been a very skilful one to leave no trace\u201d\nI argued.",
    "\u201cSomething that the ordinary person would have difficulty in\ngetting hold of.",
    "Oh damn it all Poirot.",
    "I simply can\u2019t believe it now.",
    "You\ncan\u2019t know It\u2019s all pure hypothesis.\u201d\n\u201cYou are wrong my friend.",
    "As the result of our various\nconversations this morning.",
    "I have now something definite to go upon.",
    "Certain faint but unmistakable indications.",
    "The only thing is\u2014I am\nafraid.\u201d\n\u201cAfraid Of what\u201d\nHe said gravely\n\u201cOf disturbing the dogs that sleep.",
    "That is one of your proverbs is it\nnot To let the sleeping dogs lie That is what our murderer does at\npresent\u2014sleeps happily in the sun\u2026 Do we not know you and I\nHastings how often a murderer his confidence disturbed turns and kills\na second\u2014or even a third time\u201d\n\u201cYou are afraid of that happening\u201d\nHe nodded.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "If there is a murderer in the woodpile\u2014and I think there is\nHastings.",
    "Yes I think there is\u2026.\u201d\n\n\fNineteen\nVISIT TO MR. PURVIS\n\nPoirot called for his bill and paid it.",
    "\u201cWhat do we do next\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cWe are going to do what you suggested earlier in the morning.",
    "We\nare going to Harchester to interview Mr. Purvis.",
    "That is why I telephoned\nfrom the Durham Hotel.\u201d\n\u201cYou telephoned to Purvis\u201d\n\u201cNo to Theresa Arundell.",
    "I asked her to write me a letter of\nintroduction to him.",
    "To approach him with any chance of success we\nmust be accredited by the family.",
    "She promised to send it round to my\nflat by hand.",
    "It should be awaiting us there now.\u201d\nWe found not only the letter but Charles Arundell who had brought it\nround in person.",
    "\u201cNice place you have here M. Poirot\u201d he remarked glancing round\nthe sitting room of the flat.",
    "At that moment my eye was caught by an imperfectly shut drawer in\nthe desk.",
    "A small slip of paper was preventing it from shutting.",
    "Now if there was one thing absolutely incredible it was that Poirot\nshould shut a drawer in such a fashion I looked thoughtfully at Charles.",
    "He had been alone in this room awaiting our arrival.",
    "I had no doubt that\nhe had been passing the time by snooping among Poirot\u2019s papers.",
    "What a\nyoung crook the fellow was I felt myself burning with indignation.",
    "Charles himself was in a most cheerful mood.",
    "\u201cHere we are\u201d he remarked presenting a letter.",
    "\u201cAll present and\ncorrect\u2014and I hope you\u2019ll have more luck with old Purvis than we did.\u201d\n\u201cHe held out very little hope I suppose\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely discouraging\u2026 In his opinion the Lawson bird had\nclearly got away with the doings.\u201d\n\u201cYou and your sister have never considered an appeal to the lady\u2019s\nfeelings\u201d\nCharles grinned.",
    "\u201cI considered it\u2014yes.",
    "But there seemed to be nothing doing.",
    "My\neloquence was in vain.",
    "The pathetic picture of the disinherited black\n\n\fsheep\u2014and a sheep not so black as he was painted\u2014or so I\nendeavoured to suggest\u2014failed to move the woman You know she\ndefinitely seems to dislike me I don\u2019t know why.\u201d He laughed.",
    "\u201cMost\nold women fall for me quite easily.",
    "They think I\u2019ve never been properly\nunderstood and that I\u2019ve never had a fair chance\u201d\n\u201cA useful point of view.\u201d\n\u201cOh it\u2019s been extremely useful before now.",
    "But as I say with the\nLawson nothing doing.",
    "I think she\u2019s rather antiman.",
    "Probably used to\nchain herself to railings and wave a suffragette flag in good old prewar\ndays.\u201d\n\u201cAh well\u201d said Poirot shaking his head.",
    "\u201cIf simpler methods fail\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe must take to crime\u201d said Charles cheerfully.",
    "\u201cAha\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cNow speaking of crime young man is it true\nthat you threatened your aunt\u2014that you said that you would \u2018bump her\noff\u2019 or words to that effect\u201d\nCharles sat down in a chair stretched his legs out in front of him and\nstared hard at Poirot.",
    "\u201cNow who told you that\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNo matter.",
    "Is it true\u201d\n\u201cWell there are elements of truth about it.\u201d\n\u201cCome come let me hear the story\u2014the true story mind.\u201d\n\u201cOh you can have it sir.",
    "There was nothing melodramatic about it.",
    "I\u2019d been attempting a touch\u2014if you gather what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI comprehend.\u201d\n\u201cWell that didn\u2019t go according to plan.",
    "Aunt Emily intimated that\nany efforts to separate her and her money would be quite unavailing\nWell I didn\u2019t lose my temper but I put it to her plainly.",

    "And what do you do Sit down on the\ndibs and refuse to part.",
    "That\u2019s the way people get themselves murdered.",
    "Take it from me if you\u2019re bumped off you\u2019ll only have yourself to\nblame.\u2019\n\u201cShe looked at me then over the top of her spectacles in a way she\nhad.",
    "Looked at me rather nastily.",
    "\u2018Oh\u2019 she said drily enough \u2018so that\u2019s\nyour opinion is it\u2019 \u2018It is\u2019 I said.",

    "It\u2019s just that she strikes me as a malicious old\ndevil.\u201d He paused.",
    "\u201cShe hates Theresa\u2026\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cDid you know Mr. Arundell that Dr. Tanios came down to see your\naunt on the Sunday before she died\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014on the Sunday that we were there\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "You did not see him\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "We were out for a walk in the afternoon.",
    "I suppose he must have\ncome then.",

    "Who told\nyou\u201d\n\u201cMiss Lawson.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cLawson again She seems to be a mine of information.\u201d\nHe paused and then said\n\u201cYou know Tanios is a nice fellow.",
    "I like him.",
    "Such a jolly smiling\nchap.\u201d\n\u201cHe has an attractive personality yes\u201d said Poirot.",
    "Charles rose to his feet.",

    "\u201cNo\u201d said Charles meditatively.",
    "\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think really that Tanios\nwould hurt a fly.",
    "He\u2019s much too kindhearted.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about you Would you do murder if it were made worth\nwhile\u201d\nCharles laughed\u2014a ringing genuine laugh.",

    "\u201cWere you trying to frighten him Poirot\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cIf so I don\u2019t\nthink you succeeded.",
    "He showed no guilty reactions whatsoever.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "He seemed quite unruffled.\u201d\n\u201cCurious that pause he made\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cA pause\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "A pause before the word strychnine.",
    "Almost as though he had\nbeen about to say something else and thought better of it.\u201d\nI shrugged my shoulders.",
    "\u201cHe was probably thinking of a good venomoussounding poison.\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible.",
    "It is possible.",
    "But let us set off.",
    "We will I think stay\nthe night at the George in Market Basing.\u201d\nTen minutes later saw us speeding through London bound once more\nfor the country.",
    "We arrived in Harchester about four o\u2019clock and made our way\nstraight to the offices of Purvis Purvis Charlesworth and Purvis.",
    "Mr. Purvis was a big solidlybuilt man with white hair and a rosy\ncomplexion.",
    "He had a little the look of a country squire.",
    "His manner was\ncourteous but reserved.",
    "He read the letter we had brought and then looked at us across the top\nof his desk.",
    "It was a shrewd look and a somewhat searching one.",
    "\u201cI know you by name of course M. Poirot\u201d he said politely.",
    "\u201cMiss\nArundell and her brother have I gather engaged your services in this\nmatter but exactly in what capacity you propose to be of use to them I\nam at a loss to imagine.\u201d\n\u201cShall we say Mr. Purvis a fuller investigation of all the\ncircumstances\u201d\nThe lawyer said drily\n\u201cMiss Arundell and her brother have already had my opinion as to\nthe legal position.",
    "The circumstances were perfectly clear and admit of\nno misrepresentation.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly perfectly\u201d said Poirot quickly.",
    "\u201cBut you will not I am\nsure object to just repeating them so that I can envisage the situation\nclearly.\u201d\nThe lawyer bowed his head.",
    "\u201cI am at your service.\u201d\nPoirot began\n\u201cMiss Arundell wrote to you giving you instructions on the\nseventeenth of April I believe\u201d\nMr. Purvis consulted some papers on the table before him.",
    "\u201cYes that is correct.\u201d\n\u201cCan you tell me what she said\u201d\n\u201cShe asked me to draw up a will.",
    "There were to be legacies to two\nservants and to three or four charities.",
    "The rest of her estate was to pass\nto Wilhelmina Lawson absolutely.\u201d\n\u201cYou will pardon me Mr. Purvis but you were surprised\u201d\n\u201cI will admit that\u2014yes I was surprised.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Arundell had made a will previously\u201d\n\u201cYes she had made a will five years ago.\u201d\n\u201cThat will after certain small legacies left her property to her\nnephew and nieces\u201d\n\u201cThe bulk of her estate was to be divided equally between the\nchildren of her brother Thomas and the daughter of Arabella Biggs her\nsister.",
    "\u201cWhat has happened to that will\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAt Miss Arundell\u2019s request I brought it with me when I visited her at\nLittlegreen House on April 21st.\u201d\n\u201cI should be much obliged to you Mr. Purvis if you would give me a\nfull description of everything that occurred on that occasion.\u201d\nThe lawyer paused for a minute or two.",
    "Then he said very precisely\n\u201cI arrived at Littlegreen House at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon.",
    "One\nof my clerks accompanied me.",
    "Miss Arundell received me in the drawing\nroom.\u201d\n\u201cHow did she look to you\u201d\n\u201cShe seemed to me in good health in spite of the fact that she was\nwalking with a stick.",
    "That I understand was on account of a fall she had\nhad recently.",
    "Her general health as I say seemed good.",
    "She struck me as\nslightly nervous and overexcited in manner.\u201d\n\u201cWas Miss Lawson with her\u201d\n\u201cShe was with her when I arrived.",
    "But she left us immediately.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then\u201d\n\u201cMiss Arundell asked me if I had done what she had asked me to do\nand if I had brought the new will with me for her to sign.",
    "\u201cI said I had done so.",
    "I\u2014er\u2014\u201d he hesitated for a minute or two then\nwent on stiffly.",
    "\u201cI may as well say that as far as it was proper for me to\ndo so I remonstrated with Miss Arundell.",
    "I pointed out to her that this\nnew will might be regarded as grossly unfair to her family who were\nafter all her own flesh and blood.\u201d\n\u201cAnd her answer\u201d\n\u201cShe asked me if the money was or was not her own to do with as\nshe liked.",
    "I replied that certainly that was the case.",
    "\u2018Very well then\u2019 she\nsaid.",
    "I reminded her that she had known this Miss Lawson a very short\ntime and I asked her if she was quite sure that the injustice she was\ndoing her own family was legitimate.",
    "Her reply was \u2018My dear friend I\nknow perfectly what I am doing.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHer manner was excited you say.\u201d\n\u201cI think I can definitely say that it was but understand me M. Poirot\nshe was in full possession of her faculties.",
    "She was in every sense of the\nword fully competent to manage her own affairs.",
    "Though my sympathies\nare entirely with Miss Arundell\u2019s family I should be obliged to maintain\nthat in any court of law.\u201d\n\u201cThat is quite understood.",
    "Proceed I pray you.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Arundell read through her existing will.",
    "Then she stretched out\nher hand for the one I had had drawn up.",
    "I may say that I would have\npreferred to submit a draft first but she had impressed upon me that the\n\n\fwill must be brought her ready to sign.",
    "That presented no difficulties as\nits provisions were so simple.",
    "She read it through nodded her head and\nsaid she would sign it straightaway.",
    "I felt it my duty to enter one last\nprotest.",
    "She heard me out patiently but said that her mind was quite\nmade up.",
    "I called in my clerk and he and the gardener acted as witnesses\nto her signature.",
    "The servants of course were ineligible owing to the\nfact that they were beneficiaries under the will.\u201d\n\u201cAnd afterwards did she entrust the will to you for safekeeping\u201d\n\u201cNo she placed it in a drawer of her desk which drawer she locked.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was done with the original will Did she destroy it\u201d\n\u201cNo she locked it away with the other.\u201d\n\u201cAfter her death where was the will found\u201d\n\u201cIn that same drawer.",
    "As executor I had her keys and went through\nher papers and business documents.\u201d\n\u201cWere both wills in the drawer\u201d\n\u201cYes exactly as she had placed them there.\u201d\n\u201cDid you question her at all as to the motive for this rather surprising\naction\u201d\n\u201cI did.",
    "But I got no satisfactory answer.",
    "She merely assured me that\n\u2018she knew what she was doing.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless you were surprised at the proceeding\u201d\n\u201cVery surprised.",
    "Miss Arundell I should say had always shown\nherself to have a strong sense of family feeling.\u201d\nPoirot was silent a minute then he asked\n\u201cYou did not I suppose have any conversation with Miss Lawson on\nthe subject\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not.",
    "Such a proceeding would have been highly\nimproper.\u201d\nMr. Purvis looked scandalized at the mere suggestion.",
    "\u201cDid Miss Arundell say anything to indicate that Miss Lawson knew\nthat a will was being drawn in her favour\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary.",
    "I asked her if Miss Lawson was aware of what was\nbeing done and Miss Arundell snapped out that she knew nothing about\nit.",
    "\u201cIt was advisable I thought that Miss Lawson should not be aware\nof what had happened.",
    "I endeavoured to hint as much and Miss Arundell\nseemed quite of my opinion.\u201d\n\u201cJust why did you stress that point Mr. Purvis\u201d\nThe old gentleman returned his glance with dignity.",
    "\u201cSuch things in my opinion are better undiscussed.",
    "Also it might\nhave led to future disappointment.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d Poirot drew a long breath.",
    "\u201cI take it that you thought it\nprobable that Miss Arundell might change her mind in the near future\u201d\nThe lawyer bowed his head.",
    "\u201cThat is so.",
    "I fancied that Miss Arundell had had some violent\naltercation with her family.",
    "I thought it probable that when she cooled\ndown she would repent of her rash decision.\u201d\n\u201cIn which case she would have done\u2014what\u201d\n\u201cShe would have given me instructions to prepare a new will.\u201d\n\u201cShe might have taken the simpler course of merely destroying the\nwill lately made in which case the older will would have been good\u201d\n\u201cThat is a somewhat debatable point.",
    "All earlier wills you\nunderstand had been definitely revoked by the testator.\u201d\n\u201cBut Miss Arundell would not have had the legal knowledge to\nappreciate that point.",
    "She may have thought that by destroying the latter\nwill the earlier one would stand.\u201d\n\u201cIt is quite possible.\u201d\n\u201cActually if she died intestate her money would pass to her family\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "One half to Mrs. Tanios one half divisible between Charles\nand Theresa Arundell.",
    "But the fact remains however that she did not\nchange her mind She died with her decision unchanged.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u201d said Poirot \u201cis where I come in.\u201d\nThe lawyer looked at him inquiringly.",
    "Poirot leaned forward.",
    "\u201cSupposing\u201d he said \u201cthat Miss Arundell on her deathbed wished\nto destroy that will.",
    "Supposing that she believed that she had destroyed it\n\u2014but that in reality she only destroyed the first will.\u201d\nMr. Purvis shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo both wills were intact.\u201d\n\u201cThen supposing she destroyed a dummy will\u2014under the impression\nthat she was destroying the genuine document.",
    "She was very ill\nremember it would be easy to deceive her.\u201d\n\u201cYou would have to bring evidence to that effect\u201d said the lawyer\nsharply.",
    "\u201cOh undoubtedly\u2014undoubtedly\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cIs there\u2014may I ask\u2014is there any reason to believe something of\nthat kind happened\u201d\nPoirot drew back a little.",
    "\u201cI should not like to commit myself at this stage\u2014\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNaturally naturally\u201d said Mr. Purvis agreeing with a phrase that\nwas familiar to him.",
    "\u201cBut may I say strictly in confidence that there are some curious\nfeatures about this business\u201d\n\u201cReally You don\u2019t say so\u201d\nMr. Purvis rubbed his hands together with a kind of pleasurable\nanticipation.",
    "\u201cWhat I wanted from you and what I have got\u201d continued Poirot \u201cis\nyour opinion that Miss Arundell would sooner or later have changed her\nmind and relented towards her family.\u201d\n\u201cThat is only my personal opinion of course\u201d the lawyer pointed\nout.",
    "\u201cMy dear sir I quite understand.",
    "You do not I believe act for Miss\nLawson\u201d\n\u201cI advised Miss Lawson to consult an independent solicitor\u201d said Mr.\nPurvis.",
    "His tone was wooden.",
    "Poirot shook hands with him thanking him for his kindness and the\ninformation he had given us.",
    "Twenty\nSECOND VISIT TO LITTLEGREEN HOUSE\n\nOn our way from Harchester to Market Basing a matter of some ten\nmiles we discussed the situation.",
    "\u201cHave you any grounds at all Poirot for that suggestion you threw\nout\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that Miss Arundell may have believed that that particular\nwill was destroyed No mon ami\u2014frankly no.",
    "But it was incumbent\nupon me\u2014you must perceive that\u2014to make some sort of suggestion\nMr. Purvis is a shrewd man.",
    "Unless I threw out some hint of the kind I\ndid he would ask himself what I could be doing in this affair.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what you remind me of Poirot\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cNo mon ami.\u201d\n\u201cOf a juggler juggling with a lot of different coloured balls They are\nall in the air at once.\u201d\n\u201cThe different coloured balls are the different lies I tell\u2014eh\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd some day you think there will come the grand crash\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep it up forever\u201d I pointed out.",
    "\u201cThat is true.",
    "There will come the grand moment when I catch the\nballs one by one make my bow and walk off the stage.\u201d\n\u201cTo the sound of thunderous applause from the audience.\u201d\nPoirot looked at me rather suspiciously.",
    "\u201cThat well may be yes.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t learn very much from Mr. Purvis\u201d I remarked edging\naway from the danger point.",
    "\u201cNo except that it confirmed our general ideas.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it confirmed Miss Lawson\u2019s statement that she knew nothing\nabout the will until after the old lady\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cMe I do not see that it confirmed anything of the sort.\u201d\n\u201cPurvis advised Miss Arundell not to tell her and Miss Arundell\nreplied that she had no intention of doing so.\u201d\n\u201cYes that is all very nice and clear.",
    "But there are keyholes my\nfriend and keys that unlock locked drawers.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cDo you really think that Miss Lawson would eavesdrop and poke\nand pry around\u201d I asked rather shocked.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "\u201cMiss Lawson\u2014she is not an old school tie mon cher.",
    "We know that\nshe overheard one conversation which she was not supposed to have\nheard\u2014I refer to the one in which Charles and his aunt discussed the\nquestion of bumping off miserly relatives.\u201d\nI admitted the truth of that.",
    "\u201cSo you see Hastings she may easily have overheard some of the\nconversation between Mr. Purvis and Miss Arundell.",
    "He has a good\nresonant voice.\u201d\n\u201cAs for poking and prying\u201d went on Poirot.",
    "\u201cMore people do it than\nyou would suppose.",
    "Timid and easily frightened people such as Miss\nLawson often acquire a number of mildly dishonourable habits which are\na great solace and recreation to them.\u201d\n\u201cReally Poirot\u201d I protested.",
    "He nodded his head a good many times.",
    "\u201cBut yes it is so it is so.\u201d\nWe arrived at the George and took a couple of rooms.",
    "Then we\nstrolled off in the direction of Littlegreen House.",
    "When we rang the bell Bob immediately answered the challenge.",
    "Dashing across the hall barking furiously he flung himself against the\nfront door.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll have your liver and your lights\u201d he snarled.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll tear you limb\nfrom limb I\u2019ll teach you to try and get into this house Just wait until I\nget my teeth into you.\u201d\nA soothing murmur added itself to the clamour.",
    "\u201cNow then boy.",
    "Now then there\u2019s a good doggie.",
    "Come in here.\u201d\nBob dragged by the collar was immured in the morning room much\nagainst his will.",
    "\u201cAlways spoiling a fellow\u2019s sport\u201d he grumbled.",
    "\u201cFirst chance I\u2019ve\nhad of giving anyone a really good fright for ever so long.",
    "Just aching to\nget my teeth into a trouser leg.",
    "You be careful of yourself without me to\nprotect you.\u201d\nThe door of the morning room was shut on him and Ellen drew back\nbolts and bars and opened the front door.",
    "\u201cOh it\u2019s you sir\u201d she exclaimed.",
    "She drew the door right back.",
    "A look of highly pleasurable\nexcitement spread over her face.",
    "\u201cCome in sir if you please sir.\u201d\n\n\fWe entered the hall.",
    "From beneath the door on the left loud snuffling\nsounds proceeded interspersed with growls.",
    "Bob was endeavouring to\n\u201cplace\u201d us correctly.",
    "\u201cYou can let him out\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cI will sir.",
    "He\u2019s quite all right really but he makes such a noise and\nrushes at people so it frightens them.",
    "He\u2019s a splendid watchdog though.\u201d\nShe opened the morning room door and Bob shot through like a\nsuddenly projected cannonball.",
    "\u201cWho is it Where are they Oh there you are.",
    "Dear me don\u2019t I\nseem to remember\u2014\u201d sniff\u2014sniff\u2014sniff\u2014prolonged snort.",

    "\u201cHow goes it\u201d\nBob wagged his tail perfunctorily.",
    "\u201cNicely thank you.",

    "As I was about to join him Bob reappeared from some mysterious\nregion ball in mouth.",
    "He dashed up the stairs and sprawled himself on\nthe top step his ball between his paws.",
    "His tail wagged slowly.",
    "\u201cCome on\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cCome on.",
    "Let\u2019s have a game.\u201d\nMy interest in detection momentarily eclipsed we played for some\nminutes then with a feeling of guilt I hurried into the morning room.",

    "\u201cSome little white pills sir that\u2019s all she used to take.",
    "Two or three\nafter every meal.",
    "That was Dr. Grainger\u2019s orders.",
    "Oh yes she was very\ngood about it.",
    "Tiny little things they were.",
    "And then there was some stuff\nMiss Lawson swore by.",
    "Capsules they were Dr. Loughbarrow\u2019s Liver\nCapsules.",
    "You can see advertisements of them on all the hoardings.\u201d\n\u201cShe took those too\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes.",

    "Poirot continued to ask questions about Miss Arundell\u2019s last illness.",
    "Ellen gave details with relish describing the sickness the pain the\nonset of jaundice and the final delirium.",
    "I don\u2019t know whether Poirot got\nany satisfaction out of the catalogue.",
    "He listened patiently enough and\noccasionally interpolated some pertinent little question usually about\nMiss Lawson and the amount of time she spent in the sickroom.",
    "He was\nalso exceedingly interested in the diet administered to the ill woman\ncomparing it with that administered to some dead relative nonexistent\nof his own.",
    "Seeing that they were enjoying themselves so much I stole out in the\nhall again.",

    "\u201cDisappointed aren\u2019t you Well perhaps I will let you have it this\ntime.\u201d\nWhen I next went back to the morning room Poirot was talking\nabout Dr. Tanios\u2019 surprise visit on the Sunday before the old lady\u2019s\ndeath.",
    "\u201cYes sir Mr. Charles and Miss Theresa were out for a walk.",
    "Dr.\nTanios wasn\u2019t expected I know.",

    "\u2018Dr.",
    "Tanios\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Is\nMrs. Tanios with him\u2019 I told her no the gentleman had come alone.",

    "\u201cNo I did not sir I\u2019ve never been one to listen at doors no matter\nwhat some people will do\u2014and people who ought to know better\u201d\n\u201cOh but you misunderstand me.\u201d Poirot was eager apologetic.",
    "\u201cIt\njust occurred to me that perhaps you might have brought in tea while the\ngentleman was there and if so you could hardly have helped hearing\nwhat he and your mistress were talking about.\u201d\nEllen was mollified.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir I misunderstood you.",
    "No Dr. Tanios didn\u2019t stay for\ntea.\u201d\nPoirot looked up at her and twinkled a little.",

    "\u201cLet me see\u201d Poirot frowned as though trying to remember.",
    "\u201cMiss\nLawson\u2019s bedroom\u2014was it next to Miss Arundell\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cNo sir.",
    "Miss Lawson\u2019s room is right at the top of the staircase.",
    "I can\nshow you sir.\u201d\nPoirot accepted the offer.",
    "As he went up the stairs he kept close to the\nwall side and just as he reached the top uttered an exclamation and\n\n\fstooped to his trouser leg.",

    "I can\u2019t\nthink what for I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nBut there was no suspicion in Ellen\u2019s voice.",
    "To her it was just one of\nthe things that occur in houses and which one does not bother to explain\nPoirot had stepped into the room at the top of the stairs.",
    "It was of\nmoderate size.",
    "There were two windows directly facing us.",
    "There was a\ndressing table across one corner and between the windows was a\nwardrobe with a long mirror.",
    "The bed was to the right behind the door\nfacing the windows.",
    "On the lefthand wall of the room was a big\nmahogany chest of drawers and a marbletopped washstand.",

    "To let a place run to seed is not the good policy.\u201d\nThe garden was very peaceful and beautiful.",
    "The wide borders were\nfull of lupins and delphiniums and great scarlet poppies.",

    "Wandering along we came presently to a potting shed where\na big rugged old man was busy.",
    "He saluted us respectfully and Poirot\nengaged him in conversation.",
    "A mention that we had seen Mr. Charles that day thawed the old man\nand he became quite garrulous.",
    "\u201cAlways a one he was I\u2019ve known him come out here with half a\ngooseberry pie and the cook hunting high and low for it And he\u2019d go\nback with such an innocent face that durned if they wouldn\u2019t say it must\nhave been the cat though I\u2019ve never known a cat eat a gooseberry pie\nOh he\u2019s a one Mr. Charles is\u201d\n\u201cHe was down here in April wasn\u2019t he\u201d\n\u201cYes down here two weekends.",
    "Just before the missus died it was.\u201d\n\u201cDid you see much of him\u201d\n\u201cA good bit I did.",
    "There wasn\u2019t much for a young gentleman to do\ndown here and that\u2019s a fact.",
    "Used to stroll up to the George and have\none.",

    "\u201cWeeds\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s voice held a sudden tentative note.",
    "He turned his head and\nlooked searchingly along the shelves.",
    "His eye stopped at a tin.",
    "\u201cPerhaps he wanted to know how you got rid of them\u201d\n\u201cHe did that\u201d\n\u201cI suppose this is the stuff you use.\u201d\nPoirot turned the tin gently round and read the label.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s it\u201d said Angus.",
    "\u201cVery handy stuff it is.\u201d\n\u201cDangerous stuff\u201d\n\u201cNot if you use it right.",
    "It\u2019s arsenic of course.",
    "Had a bit of a joke\nabout that Mr. Charles and I did.",
    "Said as how when he had a wife and\ndidn\u2019t like her he\u2019d come to me and get a little of that stuff to put her\naway with Maybe I sez she\u2019ll be the one that wants to do away with\nyou Ah that made him laugh proper that did It was a good one that\u201d\nWe laughed as in duty bound.",
    "Poirot prised up the lid of the tin.",
    "\u201cNearly empty\u201d he murmured.",
    "The old man had a look.",
    "\u201cAye there\u2019s more gone than I thought.",
    "No idea I\u2019d used that much.",
    "I\u2019ll be having to order some more.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot smiling.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s hardly enough for you\nto spare me some for my wife\u201d\nWe all had another good laugh over this witticism.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re not married I take it mister\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAh it\u2019s always them as isn\u2019t that can afford to joke about it.",
    "Those\nthat isn\u2019t don\u2019t know what trouble is\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI gather that your wife\u2014\u201d Poirot paused delicately.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s alive all right\u2014very much so.\u201d\nAngus seemed a little depressed about it.",
    "Complimenting him on his garden we bade him farewell.",
    "Twentyone\nTHE CHEMIST THE NURSE THE DOCTOR\n\nThe tin of weed killer had started a new train of thought in my mind.",
    "It\nwas the first definite suspicious circumstance that I had encountered.",
    "Charles\u2019 interest in it the old gardener\u2019s obvious surprise at finding the\ntin almost empty\u2014it all seemed to point in the right direction.",
    "Poirot was as usual when I am excited very noncommittal.",
    "\u201cEven if some of the weed killer has been taken there is as yet no\nevidence that Charles was the person to take it Hastings.\u201d\n\u201cBut he talked so much to the gardener about it\u201d\n\u201cNot a very wise procedure if he was going to help himself to some.\u201d\nThen he went on\n\u201cWhat is the first and simplest poison to come into your mind if you\nwere asked to name one quickly\u201d\n\u201cArsenic I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "You understand then that very marked pause before the word\nstrychnine when Charles was talking to us today.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat he was about to say \u2018arsenic in the soup\u2019 and stopped\nhimself.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d I said \u201cand why did he stop himself\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "Why I may say Hastings that it was to find the answer to\nthat particular \u2018why\u2019 which made me go out into the garden in search of\nany likely source of weed killer.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you found it\u201d\n\u201cAnd I found it.\u201d\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cIt begins to look rather bad for young Charles.",
    "You had a good talk\nwith Ellen over the old lady\u2019s illness.",
    "Did her symptoms resemble those\nof arsenic poisoning\u201d\nPoirot rubbed his nose.",
    "\u201cIt is difficult to say.",

    "\u201cIt can\u2019t be natural death It\u2019s got to be\nmurder\u201d\n\u201cOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0 we seem to have changed places you and I.\u201d\nHe turned abruptly into a chemist\u2019s shop.",
    "After a long discussion of\nPoirot\u2019s particular internal troubles he purchased a small box of\nindigestion lozenges.",
    "Then when his purchase was wrapped up and he\nwas about to leave the shop his attention was taken by an attractivelywrapped package of Dr. Loughbarrow\u2019s Liver Capsules.",
    "\u201cYes sir a very good preparation.\u201d The chemist was a middleaged\nman of a chatty disposition.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll find them very efficacious.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Arundell used to take them I remember.",
    "Miss Emily\nArundell.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed she did sir.",
    "Miss Arundell of Littlegreen House.",
    "A fine old\nlady one of the old school.",
    "I used to serve her.\u201d\n\u201cDid she take many patent medicines\u201d\n\u201cNot really sir.",
    "Not so many as some elderly ladies I could name.",
    "Miss Lawson now her companion the one that\u2019s come into all the\nmoney\u2014\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cShe was a one for this that and the other.",
    "Pills lozenges dyspepsia\ntablets digestive mixtures blood mixtures.",
    "Really enjoyed herself\namong the bottles.\u201d He smiled ruefully.",
    "\u201cI wish there were more like her.",
    "People nowadays don\u2019t take to medicines as they used.",
    "Still we sell a lot\nof toilet preparations to make up for it.\u201d\n\u201cDid Miss Arundell take these Liver Capsules regularly\u201d\n\u201cYes she\u2019d been taking them for three months I think before she\ndied.\u201d\n\u201cA relative of hers a Dr. Tanios came in to have a mixture made up\none day didn\u2019t he\u201d\n\u201cYes of course the Greek gentleman that married Miss Arundell\u2019s\nniece.",
    "Yes a very interesting mixture it was.",
    "One I\u2019ve not previously\nbecome acquainted with.\u201d\nThe man spoke as of a rare botanical trophy.",
    "\u201cIt makes a change sir when you get something new.",
    "Very interesting\ncombination of drugs I remember.",
    "Of course the gentleman is a doctor.",
    "Very nice he was\u2014a pleasant way with him.\u201d\n\u201cDid his wife do any shopping here\u201d\n\n\f\u201cDid she now I don\u2019t recall.",
    "Oh yes came in for a sleeping draught\n\u2014chloral it was I remember.",
    "A double quantity the prescription was for.",
    "It\u2019s always a little difficult for us with hypnotic drugs.",
    "You see most\ndoctors don\u2019t prescribe much at a time.\u201d\n\u201cWhose prescription was it\u201d\n\u201cHer husband\u2019s I think.",
    "Oh of course it was quite all right\u2014but you\nknow we have to be careful nowadays.",
    "Perhaps you don\u2019t know the fact\nbut if a doctor makes a mistake in a prescription and we make it up in all\ngood faith and anything goes wrong it\u2019s we who have to have the blame\n\u2014not the doctor.\u201d\n\u201cThat seems very unfair\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s worrying I\u2019ll admit.",
    "Ah well I can\u2019t complain.",
    "No trouble has\ncome my way\u2014touching wood.\u201d\nHe rapped the counter sharply with his knuckles.",
    "Poirot decided to buy a package of Dr. Loughbarrow\u2019s Liver\nCapsules.",
    "\u201cThank you sir.",
    "Which size 25 50 100\u201d\n\u201cI suppose the larger ones are better value\u2014but still\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHave the 50 sir.",
    "That\u2019s the size Miss Arundell had.",
    "Eight and six.\u201d\nPoirot agreed paid over eight and six and received the parcel.",
    "Then we left the shop.",
    "\u201cSo Mrs. Tanios bought a sleeping draught\u201d I exclaimed as we got\nout into the street.",
    "\u201cAn overdose of that would kill anyone wouldn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cWith the greatest of ease.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think old Miss Arundell\u2014\u201d\nI was remembering Miss Lawson\u2019s words \u201cI daresay she\u2019d murder\nsomeone if he told her to\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cChloral is a narcotic and a hypnotic.",
    "Used to alleviate pain and as a\nsleeping draught.",
    "It can also become a habit.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think Mrs. Tanios had acquired the habit\u201d\nPoirot shook his head perplexedly.",
    "\u201cNo I hardly think so.",
    "But it is curious.",
    "I can think of one\nexplanation.",
    "But that would mean\u2014\u201d\nHe broke off and looked at his watch.",
    "\u201cCome let us see if we can find this nurse Carruthers who was with\nMiss Arundell in her last illness.\u201d\nNurse Carruthers proved to be a sensiblelooking middleaged\nwoman.",
    "Poirot now appeared in yet another r\u00f4le and with one more fictitious\nrelative.",
    "This time he had an aged mother for whom he was anxious to\nfind a sympathetic hospital nurse.",
    "\u201cYou comprehend\u2014I am going to speak to you quite frankly.",
    "My\nmother she is difficult.",
    "We have had some excellent nurses young\nwomen fully competent but the very fact that they are young has been\nagainst them.",
    "My mother dislikes young women she insults them she is\nrude and fractious she fights against open windows and modern hygiene.",
    "It is very difficult.\u201d\nHe sighed mournfully.",
    "\u201cI know\u201d said Nurse Carruthers sympathetically.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very trying\nsometimes.",
    "One has to use a lot of tact.",
    "It\u2019s no use upsetting a patient.",
    "Better to give in to them as far as you can.",
    "And once they feel you\u2019re not\ntrying to force things on them they very often relax and give in like\nlambs.\u201d\n\u201cAh I see that you would be ideal in the part.",
    "You understand old\nladies.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to do with a few in my time\u201d said Nurse Carruthers with a\nlaugh.",
    "\u201cYou can do a lot with patience and good humour.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so wise.",
    "You nursed Miss Arundell I believe.",
    "Now she\ncould not have been an easy old lady.\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know.",
    "She was strong willed but I didn\u2019t find her\ndifficult at all.",
    "Of course I wasn\u2019t there any length of time.",
    "She died on\nthe fourth day.\u201d\n\u201cI was talking to her niece Miss Theresa Arundell only yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cReally.",
    "Fancy that now What I always say is\u2014the world\u2019s a small\nplace\u201d\n\u201cYou know her I expect\u201d\n\u201cWell of course she came down after her aunt\u2019s death and she was\nhere for the funeral.",
    "And of course I\u2019ve seen her about before when\nshe\u2019s been staying down here.",
    "A very handsome girl.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed\u2014but too thin\u2014definitely too thin.\u201d\nNurse Carruthers conscious of her own comfortable plumpness\npreened herself slightly.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d she said \u201cone shouldn\u2019t be too thin.\u201d\n\u201cPoor girl\u201d continued Poirot.",
    "\u201cI am sorry for her.",
    "Entre nous\u201d he\nleaned forward confidentially \u201cher aunt\u2019s will was a great blow.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it must have been\u201d said Nurse Carruthers.",
    "\u201cI know it\ncaused a good deal of talk.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI cannot imagine what induced Miss Arundell to disinherit all her\nfamily.",
    "It seems an extraordinary procedure.\u201d\n\u201cMost extraordinary.",
    "I agree with you.",
    "And of course people say\nthere must have been something behind it all.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever get any idea of the reason Did old Miss Arundell say\nanything\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Not to me that is.\u201d\n\u201cBut to somebody else\u201d\n\u201cWell I rather fancy she mentioned something to Miss Lawson\nbecause I heard Miss Lawson say \u2018Yes dear but you see it\u2019s at the\nlawyer\u2019s.\u2019 And Miss Arundell said \u2018I\u2019m sure it\u2019s in the drawer\ndownstairs.\u2019 And Miss Lawson said \u2018No you sent it to Mr. Purvis.",
    "Don\u2019t you remember\u2019 And then my patient had an attack of nausea\nagain and Miss Lawson went away while I saw to her but I\u2019ve often\nwondered if it was the will they were talking about.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly seems probable.\u201d\nNurse Carruthers went on\n\u201cIf so I expect Miss Arundell was worried and perhaps wanted to\nalter it\u2014but there she was so ill poor dear after that\u2014that she was past\nthinking of anything.\u201d\n\u201cDid Miss Lawson take part in the nursing at all\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cOh dear no she was no manner of good Too fussy you know.",
    "She\nonly irritated my patient.\u201d\n\u201cDid you then do all the nursing yourself C\u2019est formidable \u00e7a.\u201d\n\u201cThe maid\u2014what was her name\u2014Ellen helped me.",
    "Ellen was very\ngood.",
    "She was used to illness and used to looking after the old lady.",
    "We\nmanaged pretty well between us.",
    "As a matter of fact Dr. Grainger was\nsending in a night nurse on the Friday but Miss Arundell died before the\nnight nurse arrived.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps Miss Lawson helped to prepare some of the invalid\u2019s\nfood\u201d\n\u201cNo she didn\u2019t do anything at all.",
    "There wasn\u2019t really anything to\nprepare.",
    "I had the Valentine and the brandy\u2014and the Brand\u2019s and\nglucose and all that.",
    "All Miss Lawson did was to go about the house\ncrying and getting in everyone\u2019s way.\u201d\nThe nurse\u2019s tone held distinct acrimony.",

    "They\u2019re not\ntrained you see in any way.",
    "Just amateurs.",
    "And usually they\u2019re women\n\n\fwho wouldn\u2019t be any good at anything else.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think Miss Lawson was very attached to Miss Arundell\u201d\n\u201cShe seemed to be.",

    "\u201cI do not suppose there is any sinister reason.",

    "Every single little thing that anyone does is open to the\nmost sinister constructions.\u201d\n\u201cIt is true that I myself have enjoined upon you the motto \u2018suspect\neveryone.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAre you still in that state yourself\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014for me it has boiled down to this.",
    "I suspect one particular\nperson.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one\u201d\n\u201cSince at the moment it is only suspicion and there is no definite\nproof I think I must leave you to draw your own deductions Hastings.",
    "And do not neglect the psychology\u2014that is important.",

    "He did not take the matter as a joke.",
    "Instead he\nmurmured \u201cYou are right.",
    "I must be careful\u2014extremely careful.\u201d\n\u201cYou ought to wear a coat of chain mail\u201d I said chaffingly.",

    "Ellen should have remembered that I am the\nmistress of the house now.\u201d\nShe drew herself up importantly.",
    "\u201cEllen was very devoted to her mistress was she not\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cOh I agree that it\u2019s no good making a fuss after things have\nhappened but all the same I think Ellen ought to be told that she mustn\u2019t\ntake it upon herself to do things without asking first\u201d She stopped a red\nspot on each cheekbone.",
    "Poirot was silent for a minute then he said\n\u201cYou wanted to see me today In what way can I be of service to\nyou\u201d\nMiss Lawson\u2019s annoyance subsided as promptly as it had arisen.",
    "She\nbegan to be flustered and incoherent again.",
    "\u201cWell really\u2014you see I just wondered\u2026 Well to tell the truth M.\nPoirot I arrived down here yesterday and of course Ellen told me you\nhad been here and I just wondered\u2014well as you hadn\u2019t mentioned to\nme that you were coming\u2014Well it seemed rather odd\u2014that I couldn\u2019t\nsee\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t see what I was doing down here\u201d Poirot finished for\nher.",
    "\u201cI\u2014well\u2014no that\u2019s exactly it.",
    "I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nShe looked at him flushed but inquiring.",
    "\u201cI must make a little confession to you\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI have\npermitted you to remain under a misapprehension I am afraid.",
    "You\nassumed that the letter I received from Miss Arundell concerned itself\nwith the question of a small sum of money abstracted by\u2014in all\npossibility\u2014Mr.",
    "Charles Arundell.\u201d\nMiss Lawson nodded.",
    "\u201cBut that you see was not the case\u2026 In fact the first I heard of the\nstolen money was from you\u2026 Miss Arundell wrote to me on the subject\nof her accident.\u201d\n\u201cHer accident\u201d\n\u201cYes she had a fall down the stairs I understand.\u201d\n\u201cOh quite\u2014quite\u2014\u201d Miss Lawson looked bewildered.",
    "She stared\nvacantly at Poirot.",
    "She went on.",
    "\u201cBut\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very\nstupid of me\u2014but why should she write to you I understand\u2014in fact I\nthink you said so\u2014that you are a detective.",
    "You\u2019re not a\u2014a doctor too\nOr a faith healer perhaps\u201d\n\u201cNo I am not a doctor\u2014nor a faith healer.",
    "But like the doctor I\nconcern myself sometimes with socalled accidental deaths.\u201d\n\u201cWith accidental deaths\u201d\n\u201cWith socalled accidental deaths I said.",
    "It is true that Miss Arundell\ndid not die\u2014but she might have died\u201d\n\u201cOh dear me yes the doctor said so but I don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d\nMiss Lawson sounded still bewildered.",
    "\u201cThe cause of the accident was supposed to be the ball of the little\nBob was it not\u201d\n\u201cYes yes that was it.",
    "It was Bob\u2019s ball.\u201d\n\u201cOh no it was not Bob\u2019s ball.\u201d\n\u201cBut excuse me M. Poirot I saw it there myself\u2014as we all ran\ndown.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw it\u2014yes perhaps.",
    "But it was not the cause of the accident.",
    "The cause of the accident Miss Lawson was a darkcoloured thread\nstretched about a foot above the top of the stairs\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014but a dog couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExactly\u201d said Poirot quickly.",
    "\u201cA dog could not do that\u2014he is not\nsufficiently intelligent\u2014or if you like he is not sufficiently evil\u2026A\nhuman being put that thread in position\u2026.\u201d\nMiss Lawson\u2019s face had gone deadly white.",
    "She raised a shaking\nhand to her face.",
    "\u201cOh M. Poirot\u2014I can\u2019t believe it\u2014you don\u2019t mean\u2014but that is\nawful\u2014really awful.",
    "You mean it was done on purpose\u201d\n\u201cYes it was done on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s dreadful.",
    "It\u2019s almost like\u2014like killing a person.\u201d\n\u201cIf it had succeeded it would have been killing a person In other\nwords\u2014it would have been murder\u201d\nMiss Lawson gave a little shrill cry.",
    "Poirot went on in the same grave tone.",
    "\u201cA nail was driven into the skirting board so that the thread could be\nattached.",
    "That nail was varnished so as not to show.",
    "Tell me do you ever\nremember a smell of varnish that you could not account for\u201d\nMiss Lawson gave a cry.",
    "\u201cOh how extraordinary To think of that Why of course And to\nthink I never thought\u2014never dreamed\u2014but then how could I And yet\nit did seem odd to me at the time.\u201d\nPoirot leant forward.",
    "\u201cSo\u2014you can help us mademoiselle.",
    "Once again you can help us.",
    "C\u2019est \u00e9patant\u201d\n\u201cTo think that was it Oh well it all fits in.\u201d\n\u201cTell me I pray of you.",
    "You smelt varnish\u2014yes\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Of course I didn\u2019t know what it was.",
    "I thought\u2014dear me\u2014is it\npaint\u2014no it\u2019s more like floor stain and then of course I thought I must\nhave imagined it.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was this\u201d\n\u201cNow let me see\u2014when was it\u201d\n\u201cWas it during that Easter weekend when the house was full of\nguests\u201d\n\u201cYes that was the time\u2014but I\u2019m trying to recall just which day it\nwas\u2026 Now let me see it wasn\u2019t Sunday.",
    "No and it wasn\u2019t on Tuesday\n\u2014that was the night Dr. Donaldson came to dinner.",
    "And on the\nWednesday they had all left.",
    "No of course it was the Monday\u2014Bank\nHoliday.",
    "I\u2019d been lying awake\u2014rather worried you know.",
    "I always think\nBank Holiday is such a worrying day There had been only just enough\ncold beef to go round at supper and I was afraid Miss Arundell might be\nannoyed about it.",
    "You see I\u2019d ordered the joint on the Saturday and of\ncourse I ought to have said seven pounds but I thought five pounds\nwould do nicely but Miss Arundell was always so vexed if there was any\nshortage\u2014she was so hospitable\u2014\u201d\nMiss Lawson paused to draw a deep breath and then rushed on.",
    "\u201cAnd so I was lying awake and wondering whether she\u2019d say\nanything about it tomorrow and what with one thing and another I was a\nlong time dropping off\u2014and then just as I was going off something\nseemed to wake me up\u2014a sort of rap or tap\u2014and I sat up in bed and\nthen I sniffed.",
    "Of course I\u2019m always terrified of fire\u2014sometimes I think\nI smell fire two or three times a night\u2014so awful wouldn\u2019t it be if one\nwere trapped Anyway there was a smell and I sniffed hard but it\nwasn\u2019t smoke or anything like that.",
    "And I said to myself it\u2019s more like\npaint or floor stain\u2014but of course one wouldn\u2019t smell that in the middle\n\n\fof the night.",
    "But it was quite strong and I sat up sniffing and sniffing and\nthen I saw her in the glass\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSaw her Saw whom\u201d\n\u201cIn my looking glass you know it\u2019s really most convenient.",
    "I left my\ndoor open a little always so as to hear Miss Arundell if she were to call\nand if she went up and down stairs I could see her.",
    "The one light was\nalways left switched on in the passage.",
    "That\u2019s how I came to see her\nkneeling on the stair\u2014Theresa I mean.",
    "She was kneeling on about the\nthird step with her head bent down over something and I was just\nthinking \u2018How odd I wonder if she\u2019s ill\u2019 when she got up and went\naway so I supposed she\u2019d just slipped or something.",
    "Or perhaps was\nstooping to pick something up.",
    "But of course I never thought about it\nagain one way or another.\u201d\n\u201cThe tap that aroused you would be the tap of the hammer on the\nnail\u201d mused Poirot.",
    "\u201cYes I suppose it would.",
    "But oh M. Poirot how dreadful\u2014how\ntruly dreadful.",
    "I\u2019ve always felt Theresa was perhaps a little wild but to\ndo a thing like that.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure it was Theresa\u201d\n\u201cOh dear me yes.\u201d\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been Mrs. Tanios or one of the maids for\ninstance\u201d\n\u201cOh no it was Theresa.\u201d\nMiss Lawson shook her head and murmured to herself\n\u201cOh dear.",
    "Oh dear\u201d several times.",
    "Poirot was staring at her in a way I found it hard to understand.",
    "\u201cPermit me\u201d he said suddenly \u201cto make an experiment.",
    "Let us go\nupstairs and endeavour to reconstruct this little scene.\u201d\n\u201cReconstruction Oh really\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014I mean I don\u2019t quite see\n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI will show you\u201d said Poirot cutting in upon these doubts in an\nauthoritative manner.",
    "Somewhat flustered Miss Lawson led the way upstairs.",
    "\u201cI hope the room\u2019s tidy\u2014so much to do\u2014what with one thing and\nanother\u2014\u201d she tailed off incoherently.",
    "The room was indeed somewhat heavily littered with miscellaneous\narticles obviously the result of Miss Lawson\u2019s turning out of cupboards.",
    "With her usual incoherence Miss Lawson managed to indicate her own\nposition and Poirot was able to verify for himself the fact that a portion\nof the staircase was reflected in the wall mirror.",
    "\u201cAnd now mademoiselle\u201d he suggested \u201cif you will be so good as\nto go out and reproduce the actions that you saw.\u201d\nMiss Lawson still murmuring \u201cOh dear\u2014\u201d bustled out to fulfil her\npart.",
    "Poirot acted the part of the observer.",
    "The performance concluded he went out on the landing and asked\nwhich electric light had been left switched on.",
    "\u201cThis one\u2014this one along here.",
    "Just outside Miss Arundell\u2019s door.\u201d\nPoirot reached up detached the bulb and examined it.",
    "\u201cA forty watt lamp I see.",
    "Not very powerful.\u201d\n\u201cNo it was just so that the passage shouldn\u2019t be quite dark.\u201d\nPoirot retraced his steps to the top of the stairs.",
    "\u201cYou will pardon me mademoiselle but with the light being fairly\ndim and the way that shadow falls it is hardly possible that you can have\nseen very clearly.",
    "Can you be positive it was Miss Theresa Arundell and\nnot just an indeterminate female figure in a dressing gown\u201d\nMiss Lawson was indignant.",
    "\u201cNo indeed M. Poirot I\u2019m perfectly sure I know Theresa well\nenough I should hope Oh it was her all right.",
    "Her dark dressing gown\nand that big shining brooch she wears with the initials\u2014I saw that\nplainly.\u201d\n\u201cSo that there is no possible doubt.",
    "You saw the initials\u201d\n\u201cYes T.A.",
    "I know the brooch.",
    "Theresa often wore it.",
    "Oh yes I could\nswear to its being Theresa\u2014and I will swear to it if necessary\u201d\nThere was a firmness and decision in those last two sentences that\nwas quite at variance with her usual manner.",
    "Poirot looked at her.",
    "Again there was something curious in his\nglance.",
    "It was aloof appraising\u2014and had also a queer appearance of\nfinality about it.",
    "\u201cYou would swear to that yes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIf\u2014if\u2014it\u2019s necessary.",
    "But I suppose it\u2014will it be necessary\u201d\nAgain Poirot turned that appraising glance upon her.",
    "\u201cThat will depend on the result of the exhumation\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cEx\u2014exhumation\u201d\nPoirot put out a restraining hand.",
    "In her excitement Miss Lawson\nvery nearly went headlong down the stairs.",
    "\u201cIt may possibly be a question of exhumation\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOh but surely\u2014how very unpleasant But I mean I\u2019m sure the\nfamily would oppose the idea very strongly\u2014very strongly indeed.\u201d\n\u201cProbably they will.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure they won\u2019t hear of such a thing\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAh but if it is an order from the Home Office.\u201d\n\u201cBut M. Poirot\u2014why I mean it\u2019s not as though\u2014not as though\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot as though what\u201d\n\u201cNot as though there were anything\u2014wrong.\u201d\n\u201cYou think not\u201d\n\u201cNo of course not.",
    "Why there couldn\u2019t be I mean the doctor and the\nnurse and everything\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo not upset yourself\u201d said Poirot calmly and soothingly.",
    "\u201cOh but I can\u2019t help it Poor dear Miss Arundell It\u2019s not even as\nthough Theresa had been here in the house when she died.\u201d\n\u201cNo she left on the Monday before she was taken ill did she not\u201d\n\u201cQuite early in the morning.",
    "So you see she can\u2019t have had anything\nto do with it\u201d\n\u201cLet us hope not\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cOh dear.\u201d Miss Lawson clasped her hands together.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve never\nknown anything so dreadful as all this Really I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m\non my head or my heels.\u201d\nPoirot glanced at his watch.",
    "\u201cWe must depart.",
    "We are returning to London.",
    "And you\nmademoiselle you are remaining down here some little time\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2026 I have really no settled plans.",
    "Actually I\u2019m going back\nmyself today\u2026 I only came down just for a night to\u2014to settle things a\nlittle.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "Well goodbye mademoiselle and forgive me if I have upset\nyou at all.\u201d\n\u201cOh M. Poirot.",
    "Upset me I feel quite ill Oh dear\u2014Oh dear it\u2019s\nsuch a wicked world Such a dreadfully wicked world.\u201d\nPoirot cut short her lamentations by taking her hand firmly in his.",
    "\u201cQuite so.",
    "And you are still ready to swear that you saw Theresa\nArundell kneeling on the stairs on the night of Easter Bank Holiday\u201d\n\u201cOh yes I can swear to that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you can also swear that you saw a halo of light round Miss\nArundell\u2019s head during the s\u00e9ance\u201d\nMiss Lawson\u2019s mouth fell open.",
    "\u201cOh M. Poirot don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t joke about these things.\u201d\n\u201cI am not joking.",
    "I am perfectly serious.\u201d\nMiss Lawson said with dignity\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly a halo.",
    "It was more like the beginning of a\nmanifestation.",
    "A ribbon of some luminous material.",
    "I think it was\nbeginning to form into a face.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cExtremely interesting.",
    "Au revoir mademoiselle and please keep all\nthis to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cOh of course\u2014of course.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t dream of doing anything\nelse\u2026.\u201d\nThe last we saw of Miss Lawson was her rather sheeplike face gazing\nafter us from the front doorstep.",
    "Twentythree\nDR. TANIOS CALLS ON US\n\nNo sooner had we left the house than Poirot\u2019s manner changed.",
    "His face\nwas grim and set.",

    "\u201cWe must get back to London\nas soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m willing.\u201d I quickened my pace to suit his.",
    "I stole a look at his\ngrave face.",

    "\u201cI wish you\u2019d tell me.",
    "Do\nyou believe it was Theresa Arundell on the stairs or not\u201d\nPoirot did not reply to my questions.",

    "I cannot be precise.",
    "But as she was talking I had\nsomehow a feeling of unreality\u2026as though there was something\u2014some\nsmall point that was wrong\u2014that was yes that was the feeling\u2014\nsomething that was impossible.\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShe seemed quite positive it was Theresa\u201d\n\u201cYes yes.\u201d\n\u201cBut after all the light couldn\u2019t have been very good.",
    "I don\u2019t see how\nshe can be quite so sure.\u201d\n\u201cNo no Hastings you are not helping me.",
    "It was some small point\u2014\nsomething connected with\u2014yes I am sure of it\u2014with the bedroom.\u201d\n\u201cWith the bedroom\u201d I repeated trying to recall the details of the\nroom.",

    "\u201cWe must go and see Theresa Arundell immediately.\u201d\n\u201cAnd find out the truth But won\u2019t she deny the whole thing\nanyway\u201d\n\u201cMon cher it is not a criminal offence to kneel upon a flight of stairs\nShe may have been picking up a pin to bring her luck\u2014something of that\nsort\u201d\n\u201cAnd the smell of varnish\u201d\nWe could say no more just then as the waiter arrived with the bill.",
    "On the way to London we talked very little.",
    "I am not fond of talking\nand driving and Poirot was so busy protecting his moustaches with his\nmuffler from the disastrous effects of wind and dust that speech was\nquite beyond him.",

    "No there was no exact reason but to be frank I am very\nmuch concerned about my wife\u2019s state of health.\u201d\n\u201cAh she is not strong\u201d\n\u201cHer bodily health\u201d said Tanios slowly \u201cis good.",
    "I wish I could say\nthe same for her mind.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d\n\u201cI fear M. Poirot that she is on the verge of a complete nervous\nbreakdown.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Dr. Tanios I am extremely sorry to hear this.\u201d\n\u201cThis condition has been growing for some time.",
    "During the last two\nmonths her manner towards me has completely changed.",
    "She is nervous\neasily startled and she has the oddest fancies\u2014actually they are more\nthan fancies\u2014they are delusions\u201d\n\n\f\u201cReally\u201d\n\u201cYes.",

    "Naturally.",
    "But what I do not quite understand is why you\nhave come to me.",
    "How can I help you\u201d\nDr. Tanios seemed a little embarrassed.",
    "\u201cIt occurred to me that my wife might have\u2014or may yet\u2014come to\nyou with some extraordinary tale.",
    "She may conceivably say that she is in\ndanger from me\u2014something of the kind.\u201d\n\u201cBut why should she come to me\u201d\nDr. Tanios smiled\u2014it was a charming smile\u2014genial yet wistful.",
    "\u201cYou are a celebrated detective M. Poirot.",
    "I saw\u2014I could see at once\n\u2014that my wife was very impressed at meeting you yesterday.",
    "The mere\nfact of meeting a detective would make a powerful impression on her in\nher present state.",
    "It seems to me highly probable that she might seek you\nout and\u2014and\u2014well confide in you.",
    "That is the way these nervous\naffections go There is a tendency to turn against those nearest and\ndearest to you.\u201d\n\u201cVery distressing.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed.",
    "I am very fond of my wife.\u201d There was a rich\ntenderness in his voice.",
    "\u201cI always feel it was so brave of her to marry me\n\u2014a man of another race\u2014to come out to a far country\u2014to leave all her\nown friends and surroundings.",
    "For the last few days I have been really\ndistraught\u2026 I can see only one thing for it\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cPerfect rest and quiet\u2014and suitable psychological treatment.",
    "There\nis a splendid home I know of run by a firstclass man.",
    "I want to take her\nthere\u2014it is in Norfolk\u2014straightaway.",
    "Perfect rest and isolation from\noutside influence\u2014that is what is needed.",
    "I feel convinced that once she\nhas been there a month or two under skilled treatment there will be a\nchange for the better.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He uttered the words in a matteroffact manner without any clue to\nthe feelings that prompted him.",
    "Tanios again shot a quick glance at him.",
    "\u201cThat is why if she should come to you I should be obliged if you\nwill let me know at once.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cBut certainly.",
    "I will telephone you.",

    "I am going back there now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your wife is not there\u201d\n\u201cShe went out directly after breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cWithout telling you where she was going\u201d\n\u201cWithout saying a word.",
    "That is most unlike her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the children\u201d\n\u201cShe took them with her.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\nTanios got up.",
    "\u201cI thank you so much M. Poirot.",
    "I need hardly say that if she does\ntell you any highflown stories of intimidation and persecution pay no\nattention to them.",
    "It is unfortunately a part of her malady.\u201d\n\u201cMost distressing\u201d said Poirot with sympathy.",
    "\u201cIt is indeed.",
    "Although one knows medically speaking that it is part\nof a recognized mental disease yet one cannot help being hurt when a\nperson very near and dear to you turns against you and all their affection\nchanges to dislike.\u201d\n\u201cYou have my deepest sympathy\u201d said Poirot as he shook hands with\nhis guest.",
    "\u201cBy the way\u2014\u201d Poirot\u2019s voice recalled Tanios just as he was at the\ndoor.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cDo you ever prescribe chloral for your wife\u201d\nTanios gave a startled movement.",
    "\u201cI\u2014no\u2014at least I may have done.",
    "But not lately.",
    "She seems to have\ntaken an aversion to any form of sleeping draught.\u201d\n\u201cAh I suppose because she does not trust you\u201d\n\u201cM.",
    "Poirot\u201d\nTanios came striding forward angrily.",
    "\u201cThat would be part of the disease\u201d said Poirot smoothly.",
    "\u201cYes yes of course.\u201d\n\u201cShe is probably highly suspicious of anything you give her to eat or\ndrink.",
    "Probably suspects you of wanting to poison her\u201d\n\u201cDear me M. Poirot you are quite right.",
    "You know something of\nsuch cases then\u201d\n\u201cOne comes across them now and then in my profession naturally.",
    "But do not let me detain you.",
    "You may find her waiting for you at the\nhotel.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cTrue.",
    "I hope I shall.",
    "I feel terribly anxious.\u201d\nHe hurried out of the room.",
    "Poirot went swiftly to the telephone.",
    "He flicked over the pages of the\ntelephone directory and asked for a number.",
    "\u201cAllo\u2014Allo\u2014is that the Durham Hotel.",
    "Can you tell me if Mrs.\nTanios is in What T A N I O S. Yes that is right.",
    "Yes Yes Oh I see.\u201d\nHe replaced the receiver.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Tanios left the hotel this morning early.",
    "She returned at eleven\nwaited in the taxi whilst her luggage was brought down and drove away\nwith it.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Tanios know she took away her luggage\u201d\n\u201cI think not as yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhere has she gone\u201d\n\u201cImpossible to tell.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think she will come back here\u201d\n\u201cPossibly.",
    "I cannot tell.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps she will write.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can we do\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "He looked worried and distressed.",
    "\u201cNothing at the moment.",
    "A hasty lunch and then we will go and see\nTheresa Arundell.\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe it was her on the stairs\u201d\n\u201cImpossible to tell.",
    "One thing I made sure of\u2014Miss Lawson could\nnot have seen her face.",
    "She saw a tall figure in a dark dressing gown that\nis all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the brooch.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear friend a brooch is not part of a person\u2019s anatomy It can be\ndetached from that person.",
    "It can be lost\u2014or borrowed\u2014or even stolen.\u201d\n\u201cIn other words you don\u2019t want to believe Theresa Arundell guilty.\u201d\n\u201cI want to hear what she has to say on the matter.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if Mrs. Tanios comes back\u201d\n\u201cI will arrange for that.\u201d\nGeorge brought in an omelette.",
    "\u201cListen George\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cIf that lady comes back you will ask\nher to wait.",
    "If Dr. Tanios comes while she is here on no account let him\nin.",
    "If he asks if his wife is here you will tell him she is not.",
    "You\nunderstand\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly sir.\u201d\nPoirot attacked the omelette.",
    "\u201cThis business complicates itself\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe must step very\ncarefully.",
    "If not\u2014the murderer will strike again.\u201d\n\u201cIf he did you might get him.\u201d\n\u201cQuite possibly but I prefer the life of the innocent to the conviction\nof the guilty.",
    "We must go very very carefully.\u201d\n\n\fTwentyfour\nTHERESA\u2019S DENIAL\n\nWe found Theresa Arundell just preparing to go out.",
    "She was looking extraordinarily attractive.",
    "A small hat of the most\noutrageous fashion descended rakishly over one eye.",
    "I recognized with\nmomentary amusement that Bella Tanios had worn a cheap imitation of\nsuch a hat yesterday and had worn it\u2014as George had put it\u2014on the back\nof the head instead of over the right eye.",
    "I remembered well how she had\npushed it farther and farther back on her untidy hair.",
    "Poirot said politely\n\u201cCan I have just a minute or two mademoiselle or will it delay you\ntoo much\u201d\nTheresa laughed.",
    "\u201cOh it doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "I\u2019m always threequarters of an hour late for\neverything.",
    "I might just as well make it an hour.\u201d\nShe led him into the sitting room.",
    "To my surprise Dr. Donaldson rose\nfrom a chair by the window.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve met M. Poirot already Rex haven\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cWe met at Market Basing\u201d said Donaldson stiffly.",
    "\u201cYou were pretending to write the life of my drunken grandfather I\nunderstand\u201d said Theresa.",
    "\u201cRex my angel will you leave us\u201d\n\u201cThank you Theresa but I think that from every point of view it\nwould be advisable for me to be present at this interview.\u201d\nThere was a brief duel of eyes.",
    "Theresa\u2019s were commanding.",
    "Donaldson\u2019s were impervious.",
    "She showed a quick flash of anger.",
    "\u201cAll right stay then damn you\u201d\nDr. Donaldson seemed unperturbed.",
    "He seated himself again in the chair by the window laying down his\nbook on the arm of it.",
    "It was a book on the pituitary gland I noticed.",
    "Theresa sat down on her favourite low stool and looked impatiently\nat Poirot.",
    "\u201cWell you\u2019ve seen Purvis What about it\u201d\nPoirot said in a noncommittal voice\n\u201cThere are\u2014possibilities mademoiselle.\u201d\n\n\fShe looked at him thoughtfully.",
    "Then she sent a very faint glance in\nthe direction of the doctor.",
    "It was I think intended as a warning to\nPoirot.",
    "\u201cBut it would be well I think\u201d went on Poirot \u201cfor me to report later\nwhen my plans are more advanced.\u201d\nA faint smile showed for a minute on Theresa\u2019s face.",
    "Poirot continued\n\u201cI have today come from Market Basing and while there I have\ntalked to Miss Lawson.",
    "Tell me mademoiselle did you on the night of\nApril 13th that was the night of the Easter Bank Holiday kneel upon\nthe stairs after everyone had gone to bed\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Hercule Poirot what an extraordinary question.",
    "Why\nshould I\u201d\n\u201cThe question mademoiselle is not why you should but whether\nyou did.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know.",
    "I should think it most unlikely.\u201d\n\u201cYou comprehend mademoiselle Miss Lawson says you did.\u201d\nTheresa shrugged her attractive shoulders.",
    "\u201cDoes it matter\u201d\n\u201cIt matters very much.\u201d\nShe stared at him.",
    "In a perfectly amiable fashion Poirot stared back.",
    "\u201cLoopy\u201d said Theresa.",
    "\u201cPardon\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely loopy\u201d said Theresa.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you think so Rex\u201d\nDr. Donaldson coughed.",
    "\u201cExcuse me M. Poirot but what is the point of the question\u201d\nMy friend spread out his hands.",
    "\u201cIt is most simple Someone drove in a nail in a convenient position\nat the head of the stairs.",
    "The nail was just touched with brown varnish to\nmatch the skirting board.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a new kind of witchcraft\u201d asked Theresa.",
    "\u201cNo mademoiselle it is much more homely and simple than that.",
    "On\nthe following evening the Tuesday someone attached a string of thread\nfrom the nail to the balusters with the result that when Miss Arundell\ncame out of her room she caught her foot in it and went headlong down\nthe stairs.\u201d\nTheresa drew in her breath sharply.",
    "\u201cThat was Bob\u2019s ball\u201d\n\u201cPardon it was not.\u201d\n\n\fThere was a pause.",
    "It was broken by Donaldson who said in his quiet\nprecise voice\n\u201cExcuse me but what evidence have you in support of this\nstatement\u201d\nPoirot said quietly\n\u201cThe evidence of the nail the evidence of Miss Arundell\u2019s own\nwritten words and finally the evidence of Miss Lawson\u2019s eyes.\u201d\nTheresa found her voice.",
    "\u201cShe says I did it does she\u201d\nPoirot did not answer except by bending his head a little.",
    "\u201cWell it\u2019s a lie I had nothing to do with it\u201d\n\u201cYou were kneeling on the stairs for quite another reason\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t kneeling on the stairs at all\u201d\n\u201cBe careful mademoiselle.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t there I never came out of my room after I went to bed on\nany evening I was there.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Lawson recognized you.\u201d\n\u201cIt was probably Bella Tanios or one of the maids she saw.\u201d\n\u201cShe says it was you.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a damned liar\u201d\n\u201cShe recognized your dressing gown and a brooch you wear.\u201d\n\u201cA brooch\u2014what brooch\u201d\n\u201cA brooch with your initials.\u201d\n\u201cOh I know the one What a circumstantial liar she is\u201d\n\u201cYou still deny that it was you she saw\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s my word against hers\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou are a better liar than she is\u2014eh\u201d\nTheresa said calmly\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably quite true.",
    "But in this case I\u2019m speaking the truth.",
    "I\nwasn\u2019t preparing a booby trap or saying my prayers or picking up gold\nor silver or doing anything at all on the stairs.\u201d\n\u201cHave you this brooch that was mentioned\u201d\n\u201cProbably.",
    "Do you want to see it\u201d\n\u201cIf you please mademoiselle.\u201d\nTheresa got up and left the room.",
    "There was an awkward silence.",
    "Dr.\nDonaldson looked at Poirot much as I imagined he might have looked at\nan anatomical specimen.",
    "Theresa returned.",
    "\u201cHere it is.\u201d\n\n\fShe almost flung the ornament at Poirot.",
    "It was a large rather showy\nchromium or stainless steel brooch with T.A.",
    "enclosed in a circle.",
    "I had\nto admit that it was large enough and showy enough to be easily seen in\nMiss Lawson\u2019s mirror.",
    "\u201cI never wear it now.",
    "I\u2019m tired of it\u201d said Theresa.",
    "\u201cLondon\u2019s been\nflooded with them.",
    "Every little skivvy wears one.\u201d\n\u201cBut it was expensive when you bought it\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "They were quite exclusive to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was that\u201d\n\u201cLast Christmas I think it was.",
    "Yes about then.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever lent it to anyone\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou had it with you at Littlegreen House\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I did.",
    "Yes I did.",
    "I remember.\u201d\n\u201cDid you leave it about at all Was it out of your possession while\nyou were there\u201d\n\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t.",
    "I wore it on a green jumper.",
    "I remember.",
    "And I wore\nthe same jumper every day.\u201d\n\u201cAnd at night\u201d\n\u201cIt was still in the jumper.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the jumper.\u201d\n\u201cOh hell the jumper was sitting on a chair.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure no one removed the brooch and put it back again the\nnext day\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll say so in court if you like\u2014if you think that\u2019s the best lie to\ntell Actually I\u2019m quite sure that nothing like that happened It\u2019s a pretty\nidea that somebody framed me\u2014but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true.\u201d\nPoirot frowned.",
    "Then he got up attached the brooch carefully to his\ncoat lapel and approached a mirror on a table at the other end of the\nroom.",
    "He stood in front of it and then moved slowly backward getting\nan effect of distance.",
    "Then he uttered a grunt.",
    "\u201cImbecile that I am Of course\u201d\nHe came back and handed the brooch to Theresa with a bow.",
    "\u201cYou are quite right mademoiselle.",
    "The brooch did not leave your\npossession I have been regrettably dense.\u201d\n\u201cI do like modesty\u201d said Theresa pinning the brooch on carelessly.",
    "She looked up at him.",
    "\u201cAnything more I ought to be going.\u201d\n\u201cNothing that cannot be discussed later.\u201d\n\n\fTheresa moved towards the door.",
    "Poirot went on in a quiet voice\n\u201cThere is a question of exhumation it is true\u2014\u201d\nTheresa stopped dead.",
    "The brooch fell to the ground.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u201d\nPoirot said clearly\n\u201cIt is possible that the body of Miss Emily Arundell may be\nexhumed.\u201d\nTheresa stood still her hands clenched.",
    "She said in a low angry\nvoice\n\u201cIs this your doing It can\u2019t be done without an application from the\nfamily\u201d\n\u201cYou are wrong mademoiselle.",
    "It can be done on an order from the\nHome Office.\u201d\n\u201cMy God\u201d said Theresa.",
    "She turned and walked swiftly up and down.",
    "Donaldson said quietly\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see that there is any need to be upset Tessa.",
    "I daresay\nthat to an outsider the idea is not very pleasant but\u2014\u201d\nShe interrupted him.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool Rex\u201d\nPoirot asked\n\u201cThe idea disturbs you mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cOf course it does It isn\u2019t decent.",
    "Poor old Aunt Emily.",
    "Why the\ndevil should she be exhumed\u201d\n\u201cI presume\u201d said Donaldson \u201cthat there is some doubt as to the\ncause of death\u201d He looked inquiringly at Poirot.",
    "He went on.",
    "\u201cI confess\nthat I am surprised.",
    "I think that there is no doubt that Miss Arundell died\na natural death from a disease of long standing.\u201d\n\u201cYou told me something about a rabbit and liver trouble once\u201d said\nTheresa.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten it now but you infect a rabbit with blood from a\nperson with yellow atrophy of the liver and then you inject that rabbit\u2019s\nblood into another rabbit and then that second rabbit\u2019s blood into a\nperson and the person gets a diseased liver.",
    "Something like that.\u201d\n\u201cThat was merely an illustration of serum therapeutics\u201d said\nDonaldson patiently.",
    "\u201cPity there are so many rabbits in the story\u201d said Theresa with a\nreckless laugh.",
    "\u201cNone of us keep rabbits.\u201d She turned on Poirot and her\nvoice altered.",
    "\u201cM.",

    "\u201cIt is true enough but\u2014there are ways of avoiding such a\ncontingency mademoiselle.\u201d\n\u201cThen avoid it\u201d her voice sank almost to a whisper.",
    "It was urgent\ncompelling.",
    "\u201cAvoid it at all costs\u201d\nPoirot rose to his feet.",
    "\u201cThose are your instructions\u201d His voice was formal.",
    "\u201cThose are my instructions.\u201d\n\u201cBut Tessa\u2014\u201d Donaldson interrupted.",

    "\u201cYou must stop it I give you carte blanche.",
    "Do anything you like\nbut stop it\u201d\nPoirot bowed formally.",
    "\u201cI will do what I can.",

    "\u201cAnd take St. Leonards with you.",
    "I\nwish I\u2019d never set eyes on either of you.\u201d\nWe left the room.",
    "Poirot did not this time deliberately place his ear to\nthe crack but he dallied\u2014yes he dallied.",
    "And not in vain.",

    "Miss Arundell had been murdered and Theresa knew it.",
    "But was she\nherself the criminal or was there another explanation\nShe was afraid\u2014yes.",
    "But was she afraid for herself or for someone\nelse Could that someone be the quiet precise young doctor with the\ncalm aloof manner\nHad the old lady died of genuine disease artificially induced\nUp to a point it all fitted in\u2014Donaldson\u2019s ambitions his belief that\nTheresa would inherit money at her aunt\u2019s death.",

    "The first crime the crime that\nfailed had been her work.",
    "The second crime the crime that had\nsucceeded was Donaldson\u2019s more scientific masterpiece.",
    "Yes\u2014it all fitted in.",
    "Yet even now there were loose strands.",
    "Why had Theresa blurted out\nthose facts about inducing liver disease in human beings It was almost\nas though she did not realize the truth\u2026 But in that case\u2014and I felt my\nmind growing bewildered and I interrupted my speculations to ask\n\u201cWhere are we going Poirot\u201d\n\u201cBack to my flat.",
    "It is possible that we may find Mrs. Tanios there.\u201d\nMy thoughts switched off on a different track.",
    "Mrs. Tanios That was another mystery If Donaldson and Theresa\nwere guilty where did Mrs. Tanios and her smiling husband come in\nWhat did the woman want to tell Poirot and what was Tanios\u2019 anxiety to\nprevent her doing so\n\n\f\u201cPoirot\u201d I said humbly.",

    "There\nis the mark of one brain and one brain only in this.",
    "The psychology is\nvery clear.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that either Theresa or Donaldson did it\u2014but not both of\nthem Did he get her to hammer that nail in on some entirely innocent\npretext then\u201d\n\u201cMy dear friend from the moment I heard Miss Lawson\u2019s story I\nrealized that there were three possibilities.",
    "1 That Miss Lawson was\ntelling the exact truth.",
    "2 That Miss Lawson had invented the story for\nreasons of her own.",
    "3 That Miss Lawson actually believed her own\nstory but that her identification rested upon the brooch\u2014and as I have\nalready pointed out to you\u2014a brooch is easily detachable from its\nowner.\u201d\n\u201cYes but Theresa insists that the brooch did not leave her\npossession.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she is perfectly right.",
    "I had overlooked a small but intensely\nsignificant fact.\u201d\n\u201cVery unlike you Poirot\u201d I said solemnly.",
    "\u201cN\u2019est ce pas But one has one\u2019s lapses.\u201d\n\u201cAge will tell\u201d\n\u201cAge has nothing to do with it\u201d said Poirot coldly.",
    "\u201cWell what is the significant fact\u201d I asked as we turned in at the\nentrance of the Mansions.",
    "\u201cI will show you.\u201d\nWe had just reached the flat.",
    "George opened the door to us.",
    "In reply to Poirot\u2019s anxious question\nhe shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo sir.",
    "Mrs. Tanios has not called.",
    "Neither has she telephoned.\u201d\nPoirot went into the sitting room.",
    "He paced up and down for a few\nminutes.",
    "Then he picked up the telephone.",
    "He got first onto the Durham\nHotel.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014yes please.",
    "Ah Dr. Tanios this is Hercule Poirot speaking.",
    "Your wife has returned Oh not returned.",
    "Dear me\u2026 Taken her luggage\nyou say\u2026 And the children\u2026 You have no idea where she has gone\u2026\nYes quite\u2026 Oh perfectly\u2026 If my professional services are of any use\nto you I have certain experience in these matters\u2026 Such things can be\ndone quite discreetly\u2026 No of course not\u2026 Yes of course that is true\u2026\nCertainly\u2014certainly.",

    "That is perhaps not quite so\nunderstandable\u2026 He wants her found\u2014but he does not want me to find\nher\u2026 No definitely he does not want me to find her\u2026 He seems\nconfident that he can manage the matter himself.",
    "He does not think she\ncan remain long hidden for she has very little money with her.",
    "Also she\nhas the children.",
    "Yes I fancy he will be able to hunt her down before\nlong.",
    "But I think Hastings that we shall be a little quicker than he is.",
    "It\nis important I think that we should be.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s true that she is slightly batty\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cI think that she is in a highly nervous overwrought condition.\u201d\n\u201cBut not to such a point that she ought to be in a mental home\u201d\n\u201cThat very definitely no.\u201d\n\u201cYou know Poirot I don\u2019t quite understand all this.\u201d\n\u201cIf you will pardon my saying so Hastings you do not understand at\nall\u201d\n\u201cThere seem so many\u2014well\u2014side issues.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally there are side issues.",

    "\u201cWhat is it you cannot quite see\u201d\n\u201cWell if Donaldson had planned to do away with Miss Arundell by\nscientific means\u2014by inoculation that is to say\u2014I can\u2019t see why he\nresorted to such a clumsy device as a string across the stairs.\u201d\n\u201cEn v\u00e9rit\u00e9 Hastings there are moments when I lose patience with\nyou One method is a highly scientific one needing fully specialized\nknowledge.",
    "That is so is it not\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the other is a homely simple method\u2014\u2018the kind that mother\nmakes\u2019\u2014as the advertisements say.",
    "Is that not right\u201d\n\u201cYes exactly.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThen think Hastings\u2014think.",
    "Lie back in your chair close the eyes\nemploy the little grey cells.\u201d\nI obeyed.",
    "That is to say I leant back in the chair and closed my eyes\nand endeavoured to carry out the third part of Poirot\u2019s instructions.",
    "The\nresult however did not seem to clarify matters much.",

    "\u201cWell\u201d I said \u201cit seems to me that the kind of person who laid the\noriginal booby trap is not the kind of person to plan out a scientific\nmurder.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I doubt if a mind trained to scientific complexities would think\nof anything so childish as the accident plan\u2014it would be altogether too\nhaphazard.\u201d\n\u201cVery clearly reasoned.\u201d\nEmboldened I went on\n\u201cTherefore the only logical solution seems to be this\u2014the two\nattempts were planned by two different people.",
    "We have here to deal\nwith murder attempted by two entirely different people.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not think that is too much of a coincidence\u201d\n\u201cYou said yourself once that one coincidence is nearly always found\nin a murder case.\u201d\n\u201cYes that is true.",
    "I have to admit it.\u201d\n\u201cWell then.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who do you suggest for your villains\u201d\n\u201cDonaldson and Theresa Arundell.",
    "A doctor is clearly indicated for\nthe final successful murder.",
    "On the other hand we know that Theresa\nArundell is concerned in the first attempt.",
    "I think it\u2019s possible that they\nacted quite independently of each other.\u201d\n\u201cYou are so fond of saying \u2018we know\u2019 Hastings.",
    "I can assure you\nthat no matter what you know I do not know that Theresa was\nimplicated.\u201d\n\u201cBut Miss Lawson\u2019s story.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Lawson\u2019s story is Miss Lawson\u2019s story.",

    "Now listen mon cher I told you at\n\n\fthe time did I not that something struck me as wrong about Miss\nLawson\u2019s story\u201d\n\u201cYes I remember your saying so.",
    "But you couldn\u2019t get hold of what\nit was.\u201d\n\u201cWell I have done so now.",
    "A little moment and I will show you what\nI imbecile that I am ought to have seen at once.\u201d He went over to the\ndesk and opening a drawer took out a sheet of cardboard.",
    "He cut into this\nwith a pair of scissors motioning to me not to overlook what he was\ndoing.",
    "\u201cPatience Hastings in a little moment we will proceed to our\nexperiment.\u201d\nI averted my eyes obligingly.",
    "In a minute or two Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction.",
    "He\nput away the scissors dropped the fragments of cardboard into the\nwastepaper basket and came across the room to me.",
    "\u201cNow do not look.",
    "Continue to avert the eyes while I pin something\nto the lapel of your coat.\u201d\nI humoured him.",
    "Poirot completed the proceeding to his satisfaction\nthen propelling me gently to my feet he drew me across the room and\ninto the adjoining bedroom.",
    "\u201cNow Hastings regard yourself in the glass.",
    "You are wearing are\nyou not a fashionable brooch with your initials on it\u2014only bien\nentendu the brooch is made not of chromium nor stainless steel nor\ngold nor platinum\u2014but of humble cardboard\u201d\nI looked at myself and smiled.",
    "Poirot is uncommonly neat with his\nfingers.",
    "I was wearing a very fair representation of Theresa Arundell\u2019s\nbrooch\u2014a circle cut out of cardboard and enclosing my initials.",
    "A.H.\n\u201cEh bien\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou are satisfied You have there have you\nnot a very smart brooch with your initials\u201d\n\u201cA most handsome affair\u201d I agreed.",
    "\u201cIt is true that it does not gleam and reflect the light but all the same\nyou are prepared to admit that that brooch could be seen plainly from\nsome distance away\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never doubted it.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so.",
    "Doubt is not your strong point.",
    "Simple faith is more\ncharacteristic of you.",
    "And now Hastings be so good as to remove your\ncoat.\u201d\nWondering a little I did so.",
    "Poirot divested himself of his own coat\nand slipped on mine turning away a little as he did so.",
    "\u201cAnd now\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cRegard how the brooch\u2014the brooch with your\ninitials\u2014becomes me\u201d\nHe whisked round.",
    "I stared at him\u2014for the moment\nuncomprehendingly.",
    "Then I saw the point.",
    "\u201cWhat a blithering fool I am Of course.",
    "It\u2019s H.A.",
    "in the brooch not\nA.H. at all.\u201d\nPoirot beamed on me as he reassumed his own clothes and handed\nme mine.",
    "\u201cExactly\u2014and now you see what struck me as wrong with Miss\nLawson\u2019s story.",
    "She stated that she had seen Theresa\u2019s initials clearly on\nthe brooch she was wearing.",
    "But she saw Theresa in the glass.",
    "So if she\nsaw the initials at all she must have seen them reversed.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I argued \u201cperhaps she did and realized that they were\nreversed.\u201d\n\u201cMon cher did that occur to you just now Did you exclaim \u2018Ha\nPoirot you\u2019ve got it wrong.",
    "That\u2019s H.A.",
    "really\u2014not A.H.\u2019 No you did\nnot.",
    "And yet you are a good deal more intelligent I should say than Miss\nLawson.",
    "Do not tell me that a muddleheaded woman like that woke up\nsuddenly and still half asleep realized that A.T. was really T.A.",
    "No that\nis not at all consistent with the mentality of Miss Lawson.\u201d\n\u201cShe was determined it should be Theresa\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cYou are getting nearer my friend.",
    "You remember I hint to her that\nshe could not really see the face of anyone on the stairs and immediately\n\u2014what does she do\u201d\n\u201cRemembers Theresa\u2019s brooch and lugs that in\u2014forgetting that the\nmere fact of having seen it in the glass gave her own story the lie.\u201d\nThe telephone bell rang sharply.",
    "Poirot crossed to it.",
    "He only spoke a few noncommittal words.",
    "\u201cYes Yes\u2026 certainly.",
    "Yes quite convenient.",
    "The afternoon I think.",
    "Yes two o\u2019clock will do admirably.\u201d He replaced the receiver and turned\nto me with a smile.",

    "\u201cWell old boy what are you doing\u201d I asked facetiously.",
    "\u201cWriting an account of the case to be placed in safekeeping in case\nsomeone bumps you off during the course of the day\u201d\n\u201cYou know Hastings you are not so far wrong as you think.\u201d\nHis manner was serious.",
    "\u201cIs our murderer really about to get dangerous\u201d\n\u201cA murderer is always dangerous\u201d said Poirot gravely.",

    "Anybody would think\nI enjoyed telling lies.\u201d\n\u201cI rather think you do.",
    "In fact I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is true that I sometimes compliment myself upon my ingenuity\u201d\nPoirot confessed naively.",
    "I could not help giving a shout of laughter.",
    "Poirot looked at me\nreproachfully and we set off for Clanroyden Mansions.",
    "We were shown into the same crowded sitting room and Miss\nLawson came bustling in her manner even more incoherent than usual.",
    "\u201cOh dear M. Poirot good morning.",
    "Such a todo\u2014rather untidy I\u2019m\nafraid.",
    "But then everything is at sixes and sevens this morning.",

    "In fact she won\u2019t say anything at all.",
    "Just\nrepeats that she\u2019s left him and that nothing will induce her to go back to\nhim\u201d\n\u201cThat is a very serious step to take\u201d\n\u201cOf course it is In fact if he\u2019d been an Englishman I would have\nadvised her\u2014but there he isn\u2019t an Englishman\u2026 And she looks so\npeculiar poor thing so\u2014well so scared.",

    "\u201cIt is arranged then\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He shook hands and he and I departed.",
    "But not far.",
    "From the shelter\nof a convenient caf\u00e9 we sipped coffee and watched the entrance of the\nhotel.",
    "In about five minutes we saw Dr. Tanios walking down the street.",
    "He did not even glance up at the Wellington.",
    "He passed it his head\nbowed in thought then he turned into the Underground station.",
    "About ten minutes later we saw Mrs. Tanios and the children get into\nthe taxi with their luggage and drive away.",
    "\u201cBien\u201d said Poirot rising with the check in his hand.",
    "\u201cWe have done\nour part.",
    "Now it is on the knees of the gods.\u201d\n\n\fTwentyseven\nVISIT OF DR. DONALDSON\n\nDonaldson arrived punctually at two o\u2019clock.",
    "He was as calm and precise\nas ever.",
    "The personality of Donaldson had begun to intrigue me.",
    "I had started\nby regarding him as a rather nondescript young man.",
    "I had wondered\nwhat a vivid compelling creature like Theresa could see in him.",
    "But I\nnow began to realize that Donaldson was anything but negligible.",
    "Behind\nthat pedantic manner there was force.",
    "After our preliminary greetings were over Donaldson said\n\u201cThe reason for my visit is this.",
    "I am at a loss to understand exactly\nwhat your position is in this matter M. Poirot\u201d\nPoirot replied guardedly\n\u201cYou know my profession I think\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "I may say that I have taken the trouble to make inquiries\nabout you.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a careful man doctor.\u201d\nDonaldson said drily\n\u201cI like to be sure of my facts.\u201d\n\u201cYou have the scientific mind\u201d\n\u201cI may say that all reports on you are the same.",
    "You are obviously a\nvery clever man in your profession.",
    "You have also the reputation of\nbeing a scrupulous and honest one.\u201d\n\u201cYou are too flattering\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat is why I am at a loss to explain your connection with this\naffair.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet it is so simple\u201d\n\u201cHardly that\u201d said Donaldson.",
    "\u201cYou first present yourself as a writer\nof biographies.\u201d\n\u201cA pardonable deception do you not think One cannot go\neverywhere announcing the fact that one is a detective\u2014though that too\nhas its uses sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cSo I should imagine.\u201d Again Donaldson\u2019s tone was dry.",
    "\u201cYour next\nproceeding\u201d he went on \u201cwas to call on Miss Theresa Arundell and\n\n\frepresent to her that her aunt\u2019s will might conceivably be set aside.\u201d\nPoirot merely bowed his head in assent.",
    "\u201cThat of course was ridiculous.\u201d Donaldson\u2019s voice was sharp.",
    "\u201cYou knew perfectly well that that will was valid in law and that nothing\ncould be done about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that is the case\u201d\n\u201cI am not a fool M. Poirot\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo Dr. Donaldson you are certainly not a fool.\u201d\n\u201cI know something\u2014not very much but enough\u2014of the law.",
    "That\nwill can certainly not be upset.",
    "Why did you pretend it could Clearly for\nreasons of your own\u2014reasons which Miss Theresa Arundell did not for\na moment grasp.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem very certain of her reactions.\u201d\nA very faint smile passed across the young man\u2019s face.",
    "He said unexpectedly\n\u201cI know a good deal more about Theresa than she suspects.",
    "I have no\ndoubt that she and Charles think they have enlisted your aid in some\nquestionable business.",
    "Charles is almost completely amoral.",
    "Theresa has\na bad heredity and her upbringing has been unfortunate.\u201d\n\u201cIt is thus you speak of your fianc\u00e9e\u2014as though she was a guinea\npig\u201d\nDonaldson peered at him through his pincenez.",
    "\u201cI see no occasion to blink the truth.",
    "I love Theresa Arundell and I\nlove her for what she is and not for any imagined qualities.\u201d\n\u201cDo you realize that Theresa Arundell is devoted to you and that her\nwish for money is mainly in order that your ambitions should be\ngratified\u201d\n\u201cOf course I realize it.",
    "I\u2019ve already told you I\u2019m not a fool.",
    "But I\nhave no intention of allowing Theresa to embroil herself in any\nquestionable situation on my account.",
    "In many ways Theresa is a child\nstill.",
    "I am quite capable of furthering my career by my own efforts.",
    "I do\nnot say that a substantial legacy would not have been acceptable.",
    "It\nwould have been most acceptable.",
    "But it would merely have provided a\nshortcut.\u201d\n\u201cYou have in fact full confidence in your own abilities\u201d\n\u201cIt probably sounds conceited but I have\u201d said Donaldson\ncomposedly.",
    "\u201cLet us proceed then.",
    "I admit that I gained Miss Theresa\u2019s\nconfidence by a trick.",
    "I let her think that I would be\u2014shall we say\n\n\freasonably dishonest\u2014for money.",
    "She believed that without the least\ndifficulty.\u201d\n\u201cTheresa believes that anyone would do anything for money\u201d said\nthe young doctor in the matteroffact tone one uses when stating a selfevident truth.",
    "\u201cTrue.",
    "That seems to be her attitude\u2014her brother\u2019s also.\u201d\n\u201cCharles probably would do anything for money\u201d\n\u201cYou have no illusions I see about your future brotherinlaw.\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "I find him quite an interesting study.",
    "There is I think some\ndeepseated neurosis\u2014but that is talking shop.",
    "To return to what we are\ndiscussing.",
    "I have asked myself why you should act in the way you have\ndone and I have found only one answer.",
    "It is clear that you suspect either\nTheresa or Charles of having a hand in Miss Arundell\u2019s death.",
    "No please\ndon\u2019t bother to contradict me Your mention of exhumation was I think\na mere device to see what reaction you would get.",
    "Have you in actual\nfact taken any steps towards getting a Home Office order for\nexhumation\u201d\n\u201cI will be frank with you.",
    "As yet I have not.\u201d\nDonaldson nodded.",
    "\u201cSo I thought.",
    "I suppose you have considered the possibility that\nMiss Arundell\u2019s death may turn out to be from natural causes\u201d\n\u201cI have considered the fact that it may appear to be so\u2014yes.\u201d\n\u201cBut your own mind is made up\u201d\n\u201cVery definitely.",
    "If you have a case of\u2014say\u2014tuberculosis that looks\nlike tuberculosis behaves like tuberculosis and in which the blood gives\na positive reaction\u2014eh bien you consider it is tuberculosis do you not\u201d\n\u201cYou look at it that way Then what exactly are you waiting for\u201d\n\u201cI am waiting for a final piece of evidence.\u201d\nThe telephone bell rang.",
    "At a gesture from Poirot I got up and\nanswered it.",
    "I recognized the voice.",
    "\u201cCaptain Hastings This is Mrs. Tanios speaking.",
    "Will you tell M.\nPoirot that he is perfectly right.",
    "If he will come here tomorrow morning\nat ten o\u2019clock I will give him what he wants.\u201d\n\u201cAt ten o\u2019clock tomorrow\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cRight I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s eyes asked a question.",
    "I nodded.",
    "He turned to Donaldson.",
    "His manner had changed.",
    "It was brisk\u2014\nassured.",
    "\u201cLet me make myself clear\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI have diagnosed this case of\nmine as a case of murder.",
    "It looked like murder it gave all the\ncharacteristic reactions of murder\u2014in fact it was murder Of that there\nis not the least doubt.\u201d\n\u201cWhere then does the doubt\u2014for I perceive there is a doubt\u2014lie\u201d\n\u201cThe doubt lay in the identity of the murderer\u2014but that is a doubt no\nlonger\u201d\n\u201cReally You know\u201d\n\u201cLet us say that I shall have definite proof in my hands tomorrow.\u201d\nDr. Donaldson\u2019s eyebrows rose in a slightly ironical fashion.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cTomorrow Sometimes M. Poirot tomorrow is a\nlong way off.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary\u201d said Poirot \u201cI always find that it succeeds today\nwith monotonous regularity.\u201d\nDonaldson smiled.",
    "He rose.",
    "\u201cI fear I have wasted your time M. Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.",
    "It is always as well to understand each other.\u201d\nWith a slight bow Dr. Donaldson left the room.",
    "Twentyeight\nANOTHER VICTIM\n\n\u201cThat is a clever man\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s rather difficult to know what he is driving at.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "He is a little inhuman.",
    "But extremely perceptive.\u201d\n\u201cThat telephone call was from Mrs. Tanios.\u201d\n\u201cSo I gathered.\u201d\nI repeated the message.",
    "Poirot nodded approval.",
    "\u201cGood.",
    "All marches well.",
    "Twentyfour hours Hastings and I think\nwe shall know exactly where we stand.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still a little fogged.",
    "Who exactly do we suspect\u201d\n\u201cI really could not say who you suspect Hastings Everybody in turn\nI should imagine\u201d\n\u201cSometimes I think you like to get me into that state\u201d\n\u201cNo no I would not amuse myself in such a way.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past you.\u201d\nPoirot shook his head but somewhat absently.",
    "I studied him.",
    "\u201cIs anything the matter\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cMy friend I am always nervous towards the end of a case.",
    "If\nanything should go wrong\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIs anything likely to go wrong\u201d\n\u201cI do not think so.\u201d He paused\u2014frowning.",
    "\u201cI have I think provided\nagainst every contingency.\u201d\n\u201cThen supposing we forget crime and go to a show\u201d\n\u201cMa foi Hastings that is a good idea\u201d\nWe passed a very pleasant evening though I made the slight mistake\nof taking Poirot to a crook play.",
    "There is one piece of advice I offer all\nmy readers.",
    "Never take a soldier to a military play a sailor to a naval\nplay a Scotsman to a Scottish play a detective to a thriller\u2014and an actor\nto any play whatsoever The shower of destructive criticism in each case\nis somewhat devastating.",
    "Poirot never ceased to complain of faulty\npsychology and the hero detective\u2019s lack of order and method nearly\ndrove him demented.",
    "We parted that night with Poirot still explaining\n\n\fhow the whole business might have been laid bare in the first half of the\nfirst act.",
    "\u201cBut in that case Poirot there would have been no play\u201d I pointed\nout.",
    "Poirot was forced to admit that perhaps that was so.",
    "It was a few minutes past nine when I entered the sitting room the\nnext morning.",
    "Poirot was at the breakfast table\u2014as usual neatly slitting\nopen his letters.",
    "The telephone rang and I answered it.",
    "A heavy breathing female voice spoke\n\u201cIs that M. Poirot Oh it\u2019s you Captain Hastings.\u201d\nThere was a sort of gasp and a sob.",
    "\u201cIs that Miss Lawson\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cYes yes such a terrible thing has happened\u201d\nI grasped the receiver tightly.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d\n\u201cShe left the Wellington you know\u2014Bella I mean.",
    "I went there late\nin the afternoon yesterday and they said she\u2019d left.",
    "Without a word to\nme either Most extraordinary It makes me feel that perhaps after all\nDr. Tanios was right.",
    "He spoke so nicely about her and seemed so\ndistressed and now it really looks as though he were right after all.\u201d\n\u201cBut what\u2019s happened Miss Lawson Is is just that Mrs. Tanios left\nthe hotel without telling you\u201d\n\u201cOh no it\u2019s not that Oh dear me no.",

    "Though I do think it was odd you know.",
    "Dr. Tanios did\nsay that he was afraid she wasn\u2019t quite\u2014not quite\u2014if you know what I\nmean.",
    "Persecution mania he called it.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Damn the woman \u201cBut what\u2019s happened\u201d\n\u201cOh dear\u2014it is terrible.",
    "Died in her sleep.",
    "An overdose of some\nsleeping stuff.",
    "And those poor children It all seems so dreadfully sad\nI\u2019ve done nothing but cry since I heard.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you hear Tell me all about it.\u201d\nOut of the tail of my eye I noticed that Poirot had stopped opening\nhis letters.",
    "He was listening to my side of the conversation.",
    "I did not like\nto cede my place to him.",
    "If I did it seemed highly probable that Miss\nLawson would start with lamentations all over again.",
    "\u201cThey rang me up.",
    "From the hotel.",
    "The Coniston it\u2019s called.",
    "It seems\nthey found my name and address in her bag.",
    "Oh dear M. Poirot\u2014\nCaptain Hastings I mean isn\u2019t it terrible Those poor children left\nmotherless.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cLook here\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s an accident They didn\u2019t think\nit could be suicide\u201d\n\u201cOh what a dreadful idea Captain Hastings Oh dear I don\u2019t know\nI\u2019m sure.",
    "Do you think it could be That would be dreadful.",
    "Of course\nshe did seem very depressed.",
    "But she needn\u2019t have.",
    "I mean there\nwouldn\u2019t have been any difficulty about money.",
    "I was going to share\nwith her\u2014indeed I was.",
    "Dear Miss Arundell would have wished it.",
    "I\u2019m\nsure of that It seems so awful to think of her taking her own life\u2014but\nperhaps she didn\u2019t\u2026 The hotel people seemed to think it was an\naccident\u201d\n\u201cWhat did she take\u201d\n\u201cOne of those sleeping things.",
    "Veronal I think.",
    "No chloral.",
    "Yes that\nwas it.",
    "Chloral.",
    "Oh dear Captain Hastings do you think\u2014\u201d\nUnceremoniously I banged down the receiver.",
    "I turned to Poirot.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Tanios\u2014\u201d\nHe raised a hand.",
    "\u201cYes yes I know what you are going to say.",
    "She is dead is she not\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Overdose of sleeping draught.",
    "Chloral.\u201d\nPoirot got up.",
    "\u201cCome Hastings we must go there at once.\u201d\n\u201cIs this what you feared\u2014last night When you said you were always\nnervous towards the end of a case\u201d\n\u201cI feared another death\u2014yes.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s face was set and stern.",
    "We said very little as we drove\ntowards Euston.",
    "Once or twice Poirot shook his head.",
    "I said timidly\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2014 Could it be an accident\u201d\n\u201cNo Hastings\u2014no.",
    "It was not an accident.\u201d\n\u201cHow on earth did he find out where she had gone\u201d\nPoirot only shook his head without replying.",
    "The Coniston was an unsavourylooking place quite near Euston\nstation.",
    "Poirot with his card and a suddenly bullying manner soon\nfought his way into the manager\u2019s office.",
    "The facts were quite simple.",
    "Mrs. Peters as she had called herself and her two children had arrived\nabout half past twelve.",
    "They had had lunch at one o\u2019clock.",
    "At four o\u2019clock a man had arrived with a note for Mrs. Peters.",
    "The\nnote had been sent up to her.",
    "A few minutes later she had come down\nwith the two children and a suitcase.",
    "The children had then left with the\n\n\fvisitor.",
    "Mrs. Peters had gone to the office and explained that she should\nonly want the one room after all.",
    "She had not appeared exceptionally distressed or upset indeed she\nhad seemed quite calm and collected.",
    "She had had dinner about seven\nthirty and had gone to her room soon afterwards.",
    "On calling her in the morning the chambermaid had found her dead.",
    "A doctor had been sent for and had pronounced her to have been\ndead for some hours.",
    "An empty glass was found on the table by the bed.",
    "It seemed fairly obvious that she had taken a sleeping draught and by\nmistake taken an overdose.",
    "Chloral hydrate the doctor said was a\nsomewhat uncertain drug.",
    "There were no indications of suicide.",
    "No letter\nhad been left.",
    "Searching for means of notifying her relations Miss\nLawson\u2019s name and address had been found and she had been\ncommunicated with by telephone.",
    "Poirot asked if anything had been found in the way of letters or\npapers.",
    "The letter for instance brought by the man who had called for\nthe children.",
    "No papers of any kind had been found the man said but there was a\npile of charred paper on the hearth.",
    "Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "As far as anyone could say Mrs. Peters had had no visitors and no\none had come to her room\u2014with the solitary exception of the man who\nhad called for the two children.",
    "I questioned the porter myself as to his appearance but the man was\nvery vague.",
    "A man of medium height\u2014he thought fairhaired\u2014rather\nmilitary build\u2014of somewhat nondescript appearance.",
    "No he was\npositive the man had no beard.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Tanios\u201d I murmured to Poirot.",
    "\u201cMy dear Hastings Do you really believe that Mrs. Tanios after all\nthe trouble she was taking to get the children away from their father\nwould quite meekly hand them over to him without the least fuss or\nprotest Ah that no\u201d\n\u201cThen who was the man\u201d\n\u201cClearly it was someone in whom Mrs. Tanios had confidence or\nrather it was someone sent by a third person in whom Mrs. Tanios had\nconfidence.\u201d\n\u201cA man of medium height\u201d I mused.",
    "\u201cYou need hardly trouble yourself about his appearance Hastings.",
    "I\nam quite sure that the man who actually called for the children was some\n\n\fquite unimportant personage.",
    "The real agent kept himself in the\nbackground\u201d\n\u201cAnd the note was from this third person\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone in whom Mrs. Tanios had confidence\u201d\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the note is now burnt\u201d\n\u201cYes she was instructed to burn it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about that r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the case that you gave her\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s face looked unusually grim.",
    "\u201cThat too is burned.",
    "But that does not matter\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "For you see\u2014it is all in the head of Hercule Poirot.\u201d\nHe took me by the arm.",
    "\u201cCome Hastings let us leave here.",
    "Our concern is not with the dead\nbut with the living.",
    "It is with them I have to deal.\u201d\n\n\fTwentynine\nINQUEST AT LITTLEGREEN HOUSE\n\nIt was eleven o\u2019clock the following morning.",
    "Seven people were assembled at Littlegreen House.",
    "Hercule Poirot stood by the mantelpiece.",
    "Charles and Theresa were\non the sofa Charles on the arm of it with his hand on Theresa\u2019s shoulder.",
    "Dr. Tanios sat in a grandfather chair.",
    "His eyes were red rimmed and he\nwore a black band round his arm.",
    "On an upright chair by a round table sat the owner of the house Miss\nLawson.",
    "She too had red eyes.",
    "Her hair was even untidier than usual.",
    "Dr. Donaldson sat directly facing Poirot.",
    "His face was quite\nexpressionless.",
    "My interest quickened as I looked at each face in turn.",
    "In the course of my association with Poirot I had assisted at many\nsuch a scene.",
    "A little company of people all outwardly composed with\nwellbred masks for faces.",
    "And I had seen Poirot strip the mask from one\nface and show it for what it was\u2014the face of a killer\nYes there was no doubt of it.",
    "One of these people was a murderer\nBut which Even now I was not sure.",
    "Poirot cleared his throat\u2014a little pompously as was his habit\u2014and\nbegan to speak.",
    "\u201cWe are assembled here ladies and gentlemen to inquire into the\ndeath of Emily Arundell on the first of May last.",
    "There are four\npossibilities\u2014that she died naturally\u2014that she died as the result of an\naccident\u2014that she took her own life\u2014or lastly that she met her death at\nthe hands of some person known or unknown.",
    "\u201cNo inquest was held at the time of her death since it was assumed\nthat she died from natural causes and a medical certificate to that effect\nwas given by Dr. Grainger.",
    "\u201cIn a case where suspicion arises after burial has taken place it is\nusual to exhume the body of the person in question.",
    "There are reasons\nwhy I have not advocated that course.",
    "The chief of them is that my client\nwould not have liked it.\u201d\nIt was Dr. Donaldson who interrupted.",
    "He said\n\n\f\u201cYour client\u201d\nPoirot turned to him.",
    "\u201cMy client is Miss Emily Arundell.",
    "I am acting for her.",
    "Her greatest\ndesire was that there should be no scandal.\u201d\nI will pass over the next ten minutes since it would involve much\nneedless repetition.",
    "Poirot told of the letter he had received and\nproducing it he read it aloud.",
    "He went on to explain the steps he had\ntaken on coming to Market Basing and of his discovery of the means\ntaken to bring about the accident.",
    "Then he paused cleared his throat once more and went on\n\u201cI am now going to take you over the ground I travelled to get at the\ntruth.",
    "I am going to show you what I believe to be a true reconstruction\nof the facts of the case.",
    "\u201cTo begin with it is necessary to picture exactly what passed in Miss\nArundell\u2019s mind.",
    "That I think is fairly easy.",
    "She has a fall her fall is\nsupposed to be occasioned by a dog\u2019s ball but she herself knows better.",
    "Lying there on her bed her active and shrewd mind goes over the\ncircumstances of her fall and she comes to a very definite conclusion\nabout it.",
    "Someone has deliberately tried to injure\u2014perhaps to kill her.",
    "\u201cFrom that conclusion she passes to a consideration of who that\nperson can be.",
    "There were seven people in the house\u2014four guests her\ncompanion and two servants.",
    "Of these seven people only one can be\nentirely exonerated\u2014since to that one person no advantage could accrue.",
    "She does not seriously suspect the two servants both of whom have been\nwith her for many years and whom she knows to be devoted to her.",
    "There remain then four persons three of them members of her family\nand one of them a connection by marriage.",
    "Each of those four persons\nbenefit three directly one indirectly by her death.",
    "\u201cShe is in a difficult position since she is a woman with a strong\nsense of family feeling.",
    "Essentially she is not one who wishes to wash\nthe dirty linen in public as the saying goes.",
    "On the other hand she is not\none to submit tamely to attempted murder\n\u201cShe takes her decision and writes to me.",
    "She also takes a further\nstep.",
    "That further step was I believe actuated by two motives.",
    "One I\nthink was a distinct feeling of spite against her entire family She\nsuspected them all impartially and she determined at all costs to score\noff them The second and more reasoned motive was a wish to protect\nherself and a realization of how this could be accomplished.",
    "As you\nknow she wrote to her lawyer Mr. Purvis and directed him to draw up a\n\n\fwill in favour of the one person in the house whom she felt convinced\ncould have had no hand in her accident.",
    "\u201cNow I may say that from the terms of her letter to me and from her\nsubsequent actions I am quite sure that Miss Arundell passed from\nindefinite suspicion of four people to definite suspicion of one of those\nfour.",
    "The whole tenor of her letter to me is an insistence that this\nbusiness must be kept strictly private since the honour of the family is\ninvolved.",
    "\u201cI think that from a Victorian point of view this means that a person\nof her own name was indicated\u2014and preferably a man.",
    "\u201cIf she had suspected Mrs. Tanios she would have been quite as\nanxious to secure her own safety but not quite as concerned for the\nfamily honour.",
    "She might have felt much the same about Theresa\nArundell but not nearly as intensely as she would feel about Charles.",
    "\u201cCharles was an Arundell.",
    "He bore the family name Her reasons for\nsuspecting him seem quite clear.",
    "To begin with she had no illusions\nabout Charles.",
    "He had come near to disgracing the family once before.",
    "That is she knew him to be not only a potential but an actual criminal\nHe had already forged her name to a cheque.",
    "After forgery\u2014a step\nfurther\u2014murder\n\u201cAlso she had had a somewhat suggestive conversation with him\nonly two days before her accident.",
    "He had asked her for money and she\nhad refused and he had thereupon remarked\u2014oh lightly enough\u2014that\nshe was going the right way to get herself bumped off.",
    "To this she had\nresponded that she could take care of herself To this we are told her\nnephew responded \u2018Don\u2019t be too sure.\u2019 And two days later this sinister\naccident takes place.",
    "\u201cIt is hardly to be wondered at that lying there and brooding over the\noccurrence Miss Arundell came definitely to the conclusion that it was\nCharles Arundell who had made an attempt upon her life.",
    "\u201cThe sequence of events is perfectly clear.",
    "The conversation with\nCharles.",
    "The accident.",
    "The letter written to me in great distress of mind.",
    "The letter to the lawyer.",
    "On the following Tuesday the 21st Mr. Purvis\nbrings the will and she signs it.",
    "\u201cCharles and Theresa Arundell come down the following weekend\nand Miss Arundell at once takes the necessary steps to safeguard herself.",
    "She tells Charles about the will.",
    "She not only tells him but she actually\nshows it to him That to my mind is absolutely conclusive.",
    "She is\nmaking it quite clear to a wouldbe murderer that murder would bring\nhim nothing whatever\n\n\f\u201cShe probably thought that Charles would pass on that information to\nhis sister.",
    "But he did not do so.",
    "Why I fancy that he had a very good\nreason\u2014he felt guilty He believed that it was his doing that the will had\nbeen made.",
    "But why did he feel guilty Because he had really attempted\nmurder Or merely because he had helped himself to a small sum of\nready cash Either the serious crime or the petty one might account for\nhis reluctance.",
    "He said nothing hoping that his aunt would relent and\nchange her mind.",
    "\u201cAs far as Miss Arundell\u2019s state of mind was concerned I felt that I\nhad reconstructed events with a fair amount of correctness.",
    "I had next to\nmake up my mind if her suspicions were in actual fact justified.",
    "\u201cJust as she had done I realized that my suspicions were limited to a\nnarrow circle\u2014seven people to be exact.",
    "Charles and Theresa Arundell\nDr. Tanios and Mrs. Tanios.",
    "The two servants Miss Lawson.",
    "There was\nan eighth person who had to be taken into account\u2014namely Dr.\nDonaldson who dined there that night but I did not learn of his presence\nuntil later.",
    "\u201cThese seven persons that I was considering fell easily into two\ncategories.",
    "Six of them stood to benefit in a greater or lesser degree by\nMiss Arundell\u2019s death.",
    "If any one of those six had committed the crime\nthe reason was probably a plain matter of gain.",
    "The second category\ncontained one person only\u2014Miss Lawson.",
    "Miss Lawson did not stand to\ngain by Miss Arundell\u2019s death but as a result of the accident she did\nbenefit considerably later\n\u201cThat meant that if Miss Lawson staged the socalled accident\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI never did anything of the kind\u201d Miss Lawson interrupted.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s\ndisgraceful Standing up there and saying such things\u201d\n\u201cA little patience mademoiselle.",
    "And be kind enough not to\ninterrupt\u201d said Poirot.",
    "Miss Lawson tossed her head angrily.",
    "\u201cI insist on making my protest Disgraceful that\u2019s what it is\nDisgraceful\u201d\nPoirot went on unheeding.",
    "\u201cI was saying that if Miss Lawson staged that accident she did so for\nan entirely different reason\u2014that is she engineered it so that Miss\nArundell would naturally suspect her own family and become alienated\nfrom them.",
    "That was a possibility I searched to see if there were any\nconfirmation or otherwise and I unearthed one very definite fact.",
    "If Miss\nLawson wanted Miss Arundell to suspect her own family she would\nhave stressed the fact of the dog Bob being out that night.",
    "But on the\n\n\fcontrary Miss Lawson took the utmost pains to prevent Miss Arundell\nhearing of that.",
    "Therefore I argued Miss Lawson must be innocent.\u201d\nMiss Lawson said sharply\n\u201cI should hope so\u201d\n\u201cI next considered the problem of Miss Arundell\u2019s death.",
    "If one\nattempt to murder a person is made a second attempt usually follows.",
    "It\nseemed to me significant that within a fortnight of the first attempt Miss\nArundell should have died.",
    "I began to make inquiries.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Grainger did not seem to think there was anything unusual about\nhis patient\u2019s death.",
    "That was a little damping to my theory.",
    "But inquiring\ninto the happenings of the last evening before she was taken ill I came\nacross a significant fact.",
    "Miss Isabel Tripp mentioned a halo of light that\nhad appeared round Miss Arundell\u2019s head.",
    "Her sister confirmed her\nstatement.",
    "They might of course be inventing\u2014in a romantic spirit\u2014\nbut I did not think that the incident was quite a likely one to occur to\nthem unprompted.",
    "When questioning Miss Lawson she also gave me an\ninteresting piece of information.",
    "She referred to a luminous ribbon\nissuing from Miss Arundell\u2019s mouth and forming a luminous haze round\nher head.",
    "\u201cObviously though described somewhat differently by two different\nobservers the actual fact was the same.",
    "What it amounted to shorn of\nspiritualistic significance was this On the night in question Miss\nArundell\u2019s breath was phosphorescent\u201d\nDr. Donaldson moved a little in his chair.",
    "Poirot nodded to him.",
    "\u201cYes you begin to see.",
    "There are not very many phosphorescent\nsubstances.",
    "The first and most common one gave me exactly what I was\nlooking for.",
    "I will read you a short extract from an article on phosphorus\npoisoning.",
    "\u201cThe person\u2019s breath may be phosphorescent before he feels in any\nway affected.",
    "That is what Miss Lawson and the Misses Tripp saw in the\ndark\u2014Miss Arundell\u2019s phosphorescent breath\u2014\u2018a luminous haze.\u2019 And\nhere I will read you again.",
    "The jaundice having thoroughly pronounced\nitself the system may be considered as not only under the influence of\nthe toxic action of phosphorus but as suffering in addition from all the\naccidents incidental to the retention of the biliary secretion in the blood\nnor is there from this point any special difference between phosphorus\npoisoning and certain affections of the liver\u2014such for example as yellow\natrophy.",
    "\u201cYou see the cleverness of that Miss Arundell has suffered for years\nfrom liver trouble.",
    "The symptoms of phosphorus poisoning would only\nlook like another attack of the same complaint.",
    "There will be nothing\nnew nothing startling about it.",
    "\u201cOh It was wellplanned Foreign matches\u2014vermin paste It is not\ndifficult to get hold of phosphorus and a very small dose will kill.",
    "The\nmedicinal dose is from 1100 to 130 grain.",
    "\u201cVoil\u00e0.",
    "How clear\u2014how marvellously clear the whole business\nbecomes Naturally the doctor is deceived\u2014especially as I find his\nsense of smell is affected\u2014the garlic odour of the breath is a distinct\nsymptom of phosphorus poisoning.",
    "He had no suspicions\u2014why should\nhe have There were no suspicious circumstances and the one thing that\nmight have given him a hint was the one thing he would never hear\u2014or\nif he did hear it he would only class it as spiritualistic nonsense.",
    "\u201cI was now sure from the evidence of Miss Lawson and the Misses\nTripp that murder had been committed.",
    "The question still was by\nwhom I eliminated the servants\u2014their mentality was obviously not\nadapted to such a crime.",
    "I eliminated Miss Lawson since she would\nhardly have prattled on about luminous ectoplasm if she had been\nconnected with the crime.",
    "I eliminated Charles Arundell since he knew\nhaving seen the will that he would gain nothing by his aunt\u2019s death.",
    "\u201cThere remained his sister Theresa Dr. Tanios Mrs. Tanios and Dr.\nDonaldson whom I discovered to have been dining in the house on the\nevening of the dog\u2019s ball incident.",
    "\u201cAt this point I had very little to help me.",
    "I had to fall back upon the\npsychology of the crime and the personality of the murderer Both\ncrimes had roughly the same outline.",
    "They were both simple.",
    "They were\ncunning and carried out with efficiency.",
    "They required a certain amount\nof knowledge but not a great deal.",
    "The facts about phosphorus poisoning\nare easily learned and the stuff itself as I say is quite easily obtained\nespecially abroad.",
    "\u201cI considered first the two men.",
    "Both of them were doctors and both\nwere clever men.",
    "Either of them might have thought of phosphorus and\nits suitability in this particular case but the incident of the dog\u2019s ball did\nnot seem to fit a masculine mind.",
    "The incident of the ball seemed to me\nessentially a woman\u2019s idea.",
    "\u201cI considered first of all Theresa Arundell.",
    "She had certain\npotentialities.",
    "She was bold ruthless and not over scrupulous.",
    "She had\nled a selfish and greedy life.",
    "She had always had everything she wanted\nand she had reached a point where she was desperate for money\u2014both\n\n\ffor herself and for the man she loved.",
    "Her manner also showed plainly\nthat she knew her aunt had been murdered.",
    "\u201cThere was an interesting little passage between her and her brother.",
    "I conceived the idea that each suspected the other of the crime.",
    "Charles\nendeavoured to make her say that she knew of the existence of the new\nwill.",
    "Why Clearly because if she knew of it she could not be suspected\nof the murder.",
    "She on the other hand clearly did not believe Charles\u2019\nstatement that Miss Arundell had shown it to him She regarded it as a\nsingularly clumsy attempt on his part to divert suspicion from himself.",
    "\u201cThere was another significant point.",
    "Charles displayed a reluctance\nto use the word arsenic.",
    "Later I found that he had questioned the old\ngardener at length upon the strength of some weed killer.",
    "It was clear\nwhat had been in his mind.\u201d\nCharles Arundell shifted his position a little.",
    "\u201cI thought of it\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut\u2014well I suppose I hadn\u2019t got the\nnerve.\u201d\nPoirot nodded at him.",
    "\u201cPrecisely it is not in your psychology.",
    "Your crimes will always be\nthe crimes of weakness.",
    "To steal to forge\u2014yes it is the easiest way\u2014\nbut to kill\u2014no To kill one needs the type of mind that can be obsessed\nby an idea.\u201d\nHe resumed his lecturing manner.",
    "\u201cTheresa Arundell I decided had quite sufficient strength of mind to\ncarry such a design through but there were other facts to take into\nconsideration.",
    "She had never been thwarted she had lived fully and\nselfishly\u2014but that type of person is not the type that kills\u2014except\nperhaps in sudden anger.",
    "And yet\u2014I felt sure\u2014it was Theresa Arundell\nwho had taken the weed killer from the tin.\u201d\nTheresa spoke suddenly\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth.",
    "I thought of it.",
    "I actually took some weed\nkiller from a tin down at Littlegreen House.",
    "But I couldn\u2019t do it I\u2019m too\nfond of living\u2014of being alive\u2014I couldn\u2019t do that to anyone\u2014take life\nfrom them\u2026 I may be bad and selfish but there are things I can\u2019t do I\ncouldn\u2019t kill a living breathing human creature\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cNo that is true.",
    "And you are not as bad as you paint yourself\nmademoiselle.",
    "You are only young\u2014and reckless.\u201d\nHe went on\n\u201cThere remained Mrs. Tanios.",
    "As soon as I saw her I realized that she\nwas afraid.",
    "She saw that I realized that and she very quickly made capital\n\n\fout of that momentary betrayal.",
    "She gave a very convincing portrait of a\nwoman who is afraid for her husband.",
    "A little later she changed her\ntactics.",
    "It was very cleverly done\u2014but the change did not deceive me.",
    "A\nwoman can be afraid for her husband or she can be afraid of her husband\n\u2014but she can hardly be both.",
    "Mrs. Tanios decided on the latter r\u00f4le\u2014\nand she played her part cleverly\u2014even to coming out after me into the\nhall of the hotel and pretending that there was something she wanted to\ntell me.",
    "When her husband followed her as she knew he would she\npretended that she could not speak before him.",
    "\u201cI realized at once not that she feared her husband but that she\ndisliked him.",
    "And at once summing the matter up I felt convinced that\nhere was the exact character I had been looking for.",
    "Here was\u2014not a\nselfindulgent woman\u2014but a thwarted one.",
    "A plain girl leading a dull\nexistence unable to attract the men she would like to attract finally\naccepting a man she did not care for rather than be left an old maid.",
    "I\ncould trace her growing dissatisfaction with life her life in Smyrna\nexiled from all she cared for in life.",
    "Then the birth of her children and\nher passionate attachment to them.",
    "\u201cHer husband was devoted to her but she came secretly to dislike him\nmore and more.",
    "He had speculated with her money and lost it\u2014another\ngrudge against him.",
    "\u201cThere was only one thing that illuminated her drab life the\nexpectation of her Aunt Emily\u2019s death.",
    "Then she would have money\nindependence the means to educate her children as she wished\u2014and\nremember education meant a lot to her\u2014she was a Professor\u2019s daughter\n\u201cShe may have already planned the crime or had the idea of it in her\nmind before she came to England.",
    "She had a certain knowledge of\nchemistry having assisted her father in the laboratory.",
    "She knew the\nnature of Miss Arundell\u2019s complaint and she was well aware that\nphosphorus would be an ideal substance for her purpose.",
    "\u201cThen when she came to Littlegreen House a simpler method\npresented itself to her.",
    "The dog\u2019s ball\u2014a thread or string across the top\nof the stairs.",
    "A simple ingenious woman\u2019s idea.",
    "\u201cShe made her attempt\u2014and failed.",
    "I do not think that she had any\nidea that Miss Arundell was aware of the true facts of the matter.",
    "Miss\nArundell\u2019s suspicions were directed entirely against Charles.",
    "I doubt if\nher manner to Bella showed any alteration.",
    "And so quietly and\ndeterminedly this selfcontained unhappy ambitious woman put her\noriginal plan into execution.",
    "She found an excellent vehicle for the\npoison some patent capsules that Miss Arundell was in the habit of\n\n\ftaking after meals.",
    "To open a capsule place the phosphorus inside and\nclose it again was child\u2019s play.",
    "\u201cThe capsule was replaced among the others.",
    "Sooner or later Miss\nArundell would swallow it.",
    "Poison was not likely to be suspected.",
    "Even\nif by some unlikely chance it was she herself would be nowhere near\nMarket Basing at the time.",
    "\u201cYet she took one precaution.",
    "She obtained a double supply of\nchloral hydrate at the chemist\u2019s forging her husband\u2019s name to the\nprescription.",
    "I have no doubt of what that was for\u2014to keep by her in\ncase anything went wrong.",
    "\u201cAs I say I was convinced from the first moment I saw her that Mrs.\nTanios was the person I was looking for but I had absolutely no proof of\nthe fact.",
    "I had to proceed carefully.",
    "If Mrs. Tanios had any idea I\nsuspected her I was afraid that she might proceed to a further crime.",
    "Furthermore I believed that the idea of that crime had already occurred\nto her.",
    "Her one wish in life was to shake herself free of her husband.",
    "\u201cHer original murder had proved a bitter disappointment.",
    "The money\nthe wonderful allintoxicating money had all gone to Miss Lawson It\nwas a blow but she set to work most intelligently.",
    "She began to work on\nMiss Lawson\u2019s conscience which I suspect was already not too\ncomfortable.\u201d\nThere was a sudden outburst of sobs.",
    "Miss Lawson took out her\nhandkerchief and cried into it.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s been dreadful\u201d she sobbed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve been wicked Very wicked.",
    "You see I was very curious about the will\u2014why Miss Arundell had\nmade a new one I mean.",
    "And one day when Miss Arundell was resting\nI managed to unlock the drawer in the desk.",
    "And then I found she\u2019d left\nit all to me Of course I never dreamed it was so much.",
    "Just a few\nthousand\u2014that\u2019s all I thought it was.",
    "And why not After all her own\nrelations didn\u2019t really care for her But then when she was so ill she\nasked for the will.",
    "I could see\u2014I felt sure\u2014she was going to destroy it\u2026\nAnd that\u2019s when I was so wicked.",
    "I told her she\u2019d sent it back to Mr.\nPurvis.",
    "Poor dear she was so forgetful.",
    "She never remembered what\nshe\u2019d done with things.",
    "She believed me.",
    "Said I must write for it and I\nsaid I would.",
    "\u201cOh dear\u2014Oh dear\u2014and then she got worse and couldn\u2019t think of\nanything.",
    "And she died.",
    "And when the will was read and it was all that\nmoney I felt dreadful.",
    "Three hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds.",
    "I\u2019d never dreamed for a minute it was anything like that or I wouldn\u2019t\nhave done it.",
    "\u201cI felt just as though I\u2019d embezzled the money\u2014and I didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do.",
    "The other day when Bella came to me I told her that she\nshould have half of it.",
    "I felt sure that then I would feel happy again.\u201d\n\u201cYou see\u201d said Poirot \u201cMrs.",
    "Tanios was succeeding in her object.",
    "That is why she was so averse to any attempt to contest the will.",
    "She had\nher own plans and the last thing she wanted to do was to antagonize Miss\nLawson.",
    "She pretended of course to fall in at once with her husband\u2019s\nwishes but she made it quite clear what her real feelings were.",
    "\u201cShe had at that time two objects to detach herself and her children\nfrom Dr. Tanios and to obtain her share of the money.",
    "Then she would\nhave what she wanted\u2014a rich contented life in England with her\nchildren.",
    "\u201cAs time went on she could no longer conceal her dislike for her\nhusband.",
    "In fact she did not try to.",
    "He poor man was seriously upset\nand distressed.",
    "Her actions must have seemed quite incomprehensible to\nhim.",
    "Really they were logical enough.",
    "She was playing the part of the\nterrorized woman.",
    "If I had suspicions\u2014and she was fairly sure that that\nmust be the case\u2014she wished me to believe that her husband had\ncommitted the murder.",
    "And at any moment that second murder which I\nam convinced was already planned in her mind might occur.",
    "I knew that\nshe had a lethal dose of chloral in her possession.",
    "I feared that she would\nstage a pretended suicide and confession on his part.",
    "\u201cAnd still I had no evidence against her And then when I was quite\nin despair I got something at last Miss Lawson told me that she had\nseen Theresa Arundell kneeling on the stairs on the night of Easter\nMonday.",
    "I soon discovered that Miss Lawson could not have seen\nTheresa at all clearly\u2014not clearly enough to recognize her features.",
    "Yet\nshe was quite positive in her identification.",
    "On being pressed she\nmentioned a brooch with Theresa\u2019s initials\u2014T.A.",
    "\u201cOn my request Miss Theresa Arundell showed me the brooch in\nquestion.",
    "At the same time she absolutely denied having been on the\nstairs at the time stated.",
    "At first I fancied someone else had borrowed her\nbrooch but when I looked at the brooch in the glass the truth leaped at\nme.",
    "Miss Lawson waking up had seen a dim figure with the initials T.A.",
    "flashing in the light.",
    "She had leapt to the conclusion it was Theresa.",
    "\u201cBut if in the glass she had seen the initials T.A.\u2014then the real\ninitials must have been A.T. since the glass naturally reversed the order.",
    "\u201cOf course Mrs. Tanios\u2019 mother was Arabella Arundell.",
    "Bella is\nonly a contraction.",
    "A.T. stood for Arabella Tanios.",
    "There was nothing\nodd in Mrs. Tanios possessing a similar type of brooch.",
    "It had been\n\n\fexclusive last Christmas but by the spring they were all the rage and I\nhad already observed that Mrs. Tanios copied her cousin Theresa\u2019s hats\nand clothes as far as she was able with her limited means.",
    "\u201cIn my own mind at any rate my case was proved.",
    "\u201cNow\u2014what was I to do Obtain a Home Office order for the\nexhumation of the body That could doubtless be managed.",
    "I might\nprove that Miss Arundell had been poisoned with phosphorus though\nthere was a little doubt about that.",
    "The body had been buried two\nmonths and I understand that there have been cases of phosphorus\npoisoning where no lesions have been found and where the postmortem\nappearances are very indecisive.",
    "Even then could I connect Mrs. Tanios\nwith the purchase or possession of phosphorus Very doubtful since she\nhad probably obtained it abroad.",
    "\u201cAt this juncture Mrs. Tanios took a decisive action.",
    "She left her\nhusband throwing herself on the pity of Miss Lawson.",
    "She also\ndefinitely accused her husband of the murder.",
    "\u201cUnless I acted I felt convinced that he would be her next victim.",
    "I\ntook steps to isolate them one from the other on the pretext that it was for\nher safety.",
    "She could not very well contradict that.",
    "Really it was his\nsafety I had in mind.",
    "And then\u2014and then\u2014\u201d He paused\u2014a long pause.",
    "His face had gone rather white.",
    "\u201cBut that was only a temporary measure.",
    "I had to make sure that the\nkiller would kill no more.",
    "I had to assure the safety of the innocent.",
    "\u201cSo I wrote out my construction of the case and gave it to Mrs.\nTanios.\u201d\nThere was a long silence.",
    "Dr. Tanios cried out\n\u201cOh my God so that\u2019s why she killed herself.\u201d\nPoirot said gently\n\u201cWas it not the best way She thought so.",
    "There were you see the\nchildren to consider.\u201d\nDr. Tanios buried his face in his hands.",
    "Poirot came forward and laid a hand on his shoulder.",
    "\u201cIt had to be.",
    "Believe me it was necessary.",
    "There would have been\nmore deaths.",
    "First yours\u2014then possibly under certain circumstances\nMiss Lawson\u2019s.",
    "And so it goes on.\u201d\nHe paused.",
    "In a broken voice Tanios said\n\u201cShe wanted me\u2014to take a sleeping draught one night\u2026 There was\nsomething in her face\u2014I threw it away.",
    "That was when I began to\n\n\fbelieve her mind was going\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThink of it that way.",
    "It is indeed partly true.",
    "But not in the legal\nmeaning of the term.",
    "She knew the meaning of her action\u2026.\u201d\nDr. Tanios said wistfully\n\u201cShe was much too good for me\u2014always.\u201d\nA strange epitaph on a selfconfessed murderess\n\n\fThirty\nTHE LAST WORD\n\nThere is very little more to tell.",
    "Theresa married her doctor shortly afterwards.",
    "I know them fairly\nwell now and I have learnt to appreciate Donaldson\u2014his clarity of vision\nand the deep underlying force and humanity of the man.",
    "His manner I\nmay say is just as dry and precise as ever Theresa often mimics him to\nhis face.",
    "She is I think amazingly happy and absolutely wrapped up in\nher husband\u2019s career.",
    "He is already making a big name for himself and is\nan authority on the functions of ductless glands.",
    "Miss Lawson in an acute attack of conscience had to be restrained\nforcibly from denuding herself of every penny.",
    "A settlement agreeable to\nall parties was drawn up by Mr. Purvis whereby Miss Arundell\u2019s fortune\nwas shared out between Miss Lawson the two Arundells and the Tanios\nchildren.",
    "Charles went through his share in a little over a year and is now I\nbelieve in British Columbia.",
    "Just two incidents.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re a downy fellow ain\u2019t you\u201d said Miss Peabody stopping us\nas we emerged from the gate of Littlegreen House one day.",
    "\u201cManaged to\nhush everything up No exhumation.",
    "Everything done decently.\u201d\n\u201cThere seems to be no doubt that Miss Arundell died of yellow\natrophy of the liver\u201d said Poirot gently.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s very satisfactory\u201d said Miss Peabody.",
    "\u201cBella Tanios took an\noverdose of sleeping stuff I hear.\u201d\n\u201cYes it was very sad.\u201d\n\u201cShe was a miserable kind of woman\u2014always wanting what she\nhadn\u2019t got.",
    "People go a bit queer sometimes when they\u2019re like that.",
    "Had\na kitchenmaid once.",
    "Same thing.",
    "Plain girl.",
    "Felt it.",
    "Started writing\nanonymous letters.",
    "Queer kinks people get.",
    "Ah well I daresay it\u2019s all for\nthe best.\u201d\n\u201cOne hopes so madame.",
    "One hopes so.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Miss Peabody preparing to resume her walk \u201cI\u2019ll say\nthis for you.",
    "You\u2019ve hushed things up nicely.",
    "Very nicely indeed.\u201d She\n\n\fwalked on.",
    "There was a plaintive \u201cWuff\u201d behind me.",
    "I turned and opened the gate.",
    "\u201cCome on old man.\u201d\nBob bounced through.",
    "There was a ball in his mouth.",

    "\u201cMy word Poirot it\u2019s good to have a dog again.\u201d\n\u201cThe spoils of war\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut I would remind you my friend\nthat it was to me that Miss Lawson presented Bob not to you.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cBut you\u2019re not really any good with a dog Poirot.",
    "You don\u2019t understand dog psychology Now Bob and I understand each\nother perfectly don\u2019t we\u201d\n\u201cWoof\u201d said Bob in energetic assent."
