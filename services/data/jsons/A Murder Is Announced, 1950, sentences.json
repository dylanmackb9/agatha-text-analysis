    "You go\nround with mops and things much quicker because your behind isnt\nalways bumping into things like it is in a small room.",
    "And I like sleeping\nin a big cold room  its so cosy to snuggle down with just the tip of your\nnose telling you what its like up above.",
    "And whatever size of house you\n\n\flive in you peel the same amount of potatoes and wash up the same\namount of plates and all that.",
    "Think how nice it is for Edward and Susan\nto have a big empty room to play in where they can have railways and\ndolls teaparties all over the floor and never have to put them away\nAnd then its nice to have extra bits of the house that you can let people\nhave to live in.",

    "Im not a bit intellectual.",
    "Though I do try... And I really love\nit when you talk to me about books and history and things.",
    "I think\nperhaps it wasnt an awfully good idea to read aloud Gibbon to me in\nthe evenings because if its been a cold wind out and its nice and hot\nby the fire theres something about Gibbon that does rather make you\ngo to sleep.",

    "Mrs.",
    "Butt told me yesterday that Butt who\nnever went to church and used to be practically the local atheist\ncomes every Sunday now on purpose to hear you preach.",
    "She went on with a very fair imitation of Mrs. Butts superrefined\nvoice\n\nAnd Butt was saying only the other day Madam to Mr. Timkins from\nLittle Worsdale that wed got real culture here in Chipping Cleghorn.",
    "Not like Mr. Goss at Little Worsdale who talks to the congregation as\nthough they were children who hadnt had any education.",
    "Real culture\nButt said thats what weve got.",
    "Our Vicars a highly educated\ngentleman  Oxford not Milchester and he gives us the full benefit of\nhis education.",

    "Letty  Letty  have you seen this Whatever can it mean\n\nWhats the matter Dora\n\n\fThe most extraordinary advertisement.",
    "It says Little Paddocks quite\ndistinctly.",

    "I thought it\nmight be your idea of a joke.",
    "A joke Nothing of the kind.",
    "And you Julia\n\nJulia looking bored said Of course not.",

    "You mean\nabout that silly notice in the Gazette\n\nYes  even if its a joke it seems to me its a  a spiteful sort of joke.",
    "Spiteful\n\nYes.",
    "It seems to me theres spite there somewhere.",
    "I mean  its not a\nnice kind of joke.",
    "Miss Blacklog looked at her friend.",
    "The mild eyes the long obstinate\nmouth the slightly upturned nose.",
    "Poor Dora so maddening so\nmuddleheaded so devoted and such a problem.",
    "A dear fussy old idiot\nand yet in a queer way with an instinctive sense of values.",
    "I think youre right Dora said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Its not a nice joke.",
    "I dont like it at all said Dora Bunner with unsuspected vigour.",
    "It\nfrightens me.",
    "She added suddenly And it frightens you Letitia.",
    "Nonsense said Miss Blacklog with spirit.",
    "Its dangerous.",
    "Im sure it is.",
    "Like those people who send you bombs\ndone up in parcels.",
    "My dear its just some silly idiot trying to be funny.",
    "But it isnt funny.",
    "It wasnt really very funny... Miss Blacklogs face betrayed her thoughts\nand Dora cried triumphantly\n\nYou see.",
    "You think so too\n\nBut Dora my dear \n\nShe broke off.",
    "Through the door there surged a tempestuous young\nwoman with a well developed bosom heaving under a tight jersey.",
    "She\nhad on a dirndl skirt of a bright colour and had greasy dark plaits\nwound round and round her head.",
    "Her eyes were dark and flashing.",
    "She said gustily\n\n\fI can speak to you yes please no\n\nMiss Blacklog sighed.",
    "Of course Mitzi what is it\n\nSometimes she thought it would be preferable to do the entire work of\nthe house as well as the cooking rather than be bothered with the\neternal nerve storms of her refugee lady help.",
    "I tell you at once  it is in order I hope I give you my notices and I go  I\ngo at once\n\nFor what reason Has somebody upset you\n\nYes I am upset said Mitzi dramatically.",
    "I do not wish to die Already\nin Europe I escape.",
    "My family they all die  they are all killed  my mother\nmy little brother my so sweet little niece  all all they are killed.",
    "But me\nI run away  I hide.",
    "I get to England.",
    "I work.",
    "I do work that never  never\nwould I do in my own country  I \n\nI know all that said Miss Blacklog crisply.",
    "It was indeed a constant\nrefrain on Mitzis lips.",
    "But why do you want to leave now\n\nBecause again they come to kill me\n\nWho do\n\n\fMy enemies.",
    "The Nazis Or perhaps this time it is the Bolsheviks.",
    "They\nfind out I am here.",
    "They come to kill me.",
    "I have read it  yes  it is in the\nnewspaper\n\nOh you mean in the Gazette\n\nHere it is written here.",
    "Mitzi produced the Gazette from where she\nhad been holding it behind her back.",
    "See  here it says a murder.",
    "At Little Paddocks.",
    "That is here is it not\nThis evening at 630.",
    "Ah I do not wait to be murdered  no.",
    "But why should this apply to you Its  we think it is a joke.",
    "A joke It is not a joke to murder someone\n\nNo of course not.",
    "But my dear child if anyone wanted to murder you\nthey wouldnt advertise the fact in the paper would they\n\nYou do not think they would Mitzi seemed a little shaken.",
    "You think\nperhaps they do not mean to murder anyone at all Perhaps it is you\nthey mean to murder Miss Blacklog.",
    "I certainly cant believe anyone wants to murder me said Miss\nBlacklog lightly.",
    "And really Mitzi I dont see why anyone should want\nto murder you.",
    "After all why should they\n\nBecause they are bad peoples...",
    "Very bad peoples.",
    "I tell you my\nmother my little brother my so sweet niece.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "Miss Blacklog stemmed the flow adroitly.",
    "But I cannot\nreally believe anyone wants to murder you Mitzi.",
    "Of course if you want\nto go off like this at a moments notice I cannot possibly stop you.",
    "But I\nthink you will be very silly if you do.",
    "She added firmly as Mitzi looked doubtful Well have that beef the\nbutcher sent stewed for lunch.",
    "It looks very tough.",
    "I make you a goulash a special goulash.",
    "If you prefer to call it that certainly.",
    "And perhaps you could use up\nthat rather hard bit of cheese in making some cheese straws.",
    "I think\nsome people may come in this evening for drinks.",
    "This evening What do you mean this evening\n\nAt halfpast six.",
    "But that is the time in the paper.",
    "Who should come then Why should\nthey come\n\nTheyre coming to the funeral said Miss Blacklog with a twinkle.",
    "Thatll do now Mitzi.",
    "Im busy.",
    "Shut the door after you she added\nfirmly.",
    "And thats settled her for the moment she said as the door closed\nbehind a puzzledlooking Mitzi.",
    "You are so efficient Letty said Miss Bunner admiringly.",
    "Chapter 3 AT 630 P.M.\n\nWell here we are all set said Miss Blacklog She looked round the\ndouble drawingroom with an appraising eye.",
    "The rosepatterned\nchintzes  the two bowls of bronze chrysanthemums the small vase of\nviolets and the silver cigarettebox on a table by the wall the tray of\ndrinks on the centre table.",
    "Little Paddocks was a mediumsized house built in the early Victorian\nstyle.",
    "It had a long shallow veranda and green shuttered windows.",
    "The\nlong narrow drawingroom which lost a good deal of light owing to the\nveranda roof had originally had double doors at one end leading into a\nsmall room with a bay window.",
    "A former generation had removed the\ndouble doors and replaced them with portieres of velvet.",
    "Miss Blacklog\nhad dispensed with the portieres so that the two rooms had become\ndefinitely one.",
    "There was a fireplace each end but neither fire was lit\nalthough a gentle warmth pervaded the room.",
    "Youve had the central heating lit said Patrick.",
    "Miss Blacklog nodded.",
    "Its been so misty and damp lately.",
    "The whole house felt clammy.",
    "I got\nEvans to light it before he went.",
    "The precious precious coke said Patrick mockingly.",
    "As you say the precious coke.",
    "But otherwise there would have been\nthe even more precious coal.",
    "You know the Fuel Office wont even let us\nhave the little bit thats due to us each week  not unless we can say\ndefinitely that we havent got any other means of cooking.",
    "I suppose there was once heaps of coke and coal for everybody said\nJulia with the interest of one hearing about an unknown country.",
    "Yes and cheap too.",
    "And anyone could go and buy as much as they wanted without filling\nin anything and there wasnt any shortage There was lots of it there\n\nAll kinds and qualities  and not all stones and slates like what we get\nnowadays.",
    "It must have been a wonderful world said Julia with awe in her voice.",
    "Miss Blacklog smiled.",
    "Looking back on it I certainly think so.",
    "But then\nIm an old woman.",
    "Its natural for me to prefer my own times.",
    "But you\nyoung things oughtnt to think so.",
    "I neednt have had a job then said Julia.",
    "I could just have stayed at\nhome and done the flowers and written notes... Why did one write\nnotes and who were they to\n\nAll the people that you now ring up on the telephone said Miss\nBlacklog with a twinkle.",
    "I dont believe you even know how to write\nJulia.",
    "Not in the style of that delicious Complete Letter Writer I found the\nother day.",
    "Heavenly It told you the correct way of refusing a proposal\nof marriage from a widower.",
    "I doubt if you would have enjoyed staying at home as much as you\nthink said Miss Blacklog.",
    "There were duties you know.",
    "Her voice\nwas dry.",
    "However I dont really know much about it.",
    "Bunny and I she\nsmiled affectionately at Dora Bunner went into the labour market\nearly.",
    "Oh we did we did indeed agreed Miss Bunner.",
    "Those naughty\nnaughty children.",
    "Ill never forget them.",
    "Of course Letty was clever.",
    "She was a business woman secretary to a big financier.",
    "The door opened and Phillipa Haymes came in.",
    "She was tall and fair\nand placid looking.",
    "She looked round the room in surprise.",
    "Hallo she said.",
    "Is it a party Nobody told me.",
    "Of course cried Patrick.",
    "Our Phillipa doesnt know.",
    "The only woman\nin Chipping Cleghorn who doesnt I bet.",
    "Phillipa looked at him inquiringly.",
    "Here you behold said Patrick dramatically waving a hand the\nscene of a murder\n\nPhillipa Haymes looked faintly puzzled.",
    "Here Patrick indicated the two big bowls of chrysanthemums are\nthe funeral wreaths and these dishes of cheese straws and olives\nrepresent the funeral baked meats.",
    "Phillipa looked inquiringly at Miss Blacklog.",
    "Is it a joke she asked.",
    "Im always terribly stupid at seeing jokes.",
    "Its a very nasty joke said Dora Bunner with energy.",
    "I dont like it at\nall.",
    "Show her the advertisement said Miss Blacklog.",
    "I must go and shut\nup the ducks.",
    "Its dark.",
    "Theyll be in by now.",
    "Let me do it said Phillipa.",
    "Certainly not my dear.",
    "Youve finished your days work.",
    "Ill do it Aunt Letty offered Patrick.",
    "No you wont said Miss Blacklog with energy.",
    "Last time you didnt\nlatch the door properly.",
    "Ill do it Letty dear cried Miss Bunner.",
    "Indeed I should love to.",
    "Ill\njust slip on my goloshes  and now where did I put my cardigan\n\nBut Miss Blacklog with a smile had already left the room.",
    "Its no good Bunny said Patrick.",
    "Aunt Lettys so efficient that she\ncan never bear anybody else to do things for her.",
    "She really much\nprefers to do everything herself.",
    "She loves it said Julia.",
    "I didnt notice you making any offers of assistance said her brother.",
    "Julia smiled lazily.",
    "Youve just said Aunt Letty likes to do things herself she pointed out.",
    "Besides she held out a wellshaped leg in a sheer stocking Ive got\nmy best stockings on.",
    "Death in silk stockings declaimed Patrick.",
    "Not silk  nylons you idiot.",
    "Thats not nearly such a good title.",
    "Wont somebody please tell me cried Phillipa plaintively why there\nis all this insistence on death\n\nEverybody tried to tell her at once  nobody could find the Gazette to\nshow her because Mitzi had taken it into the kitchen.",
    "Miss Blacklog returned a few minutes later.",
    "There she said briskly thats done.",
    "She glanced at the clock.",
    "Twentypast six.",
    "Somebody ought to be here soon  unless Im entirely\nwrong in my estimate of my neighbours.",
    "I dont see why anybody should come said Phillipa looking\nbewildered.",
    "Dont you dear...",
    "I dare say you wouldnt.",
    "But most people are rather\nmore inquisitive than you are.",
    "Phillipas attitude to life is that she just isnt interested said Julia\nrather nastily.",
    "Phillipa did not reply.",
    "Miss Blacklog was glancing round the room.",
    "Mitzi had put the sherry\nand three dishes containing olives cheese straws and some little fancy\npastries on the table in the middle of the room.",
    "You might move that tray  or the whole table if you like  round the\ncorner into the bay window in the other room Patrick if you dont mind.",
    "After all I am not giving a party I havent asked anyone.",
    "And I dont\nintend to make it obvious that I expect people to turn up.",
    "You wish Aunt Letty to disguise your intelligent anticipation\n\nVery nicely put Patrick.",
    "Thank you my dear boy.",
    "Now we can all give a lovely performance of a quiet evening at home\nsaid Julia and be quite surprised when somebody drops in.",
    "Miss Blacklog had picked up the sherry bottle.",
    "She stood holding it\nuncertainly in her hand.",
    "Patrick reassured her.",
    "Theres quite half a bottle there.",
    "It ought to be enough.",
    "Oh yes  yes... She hesitated.",
    "Then with a slight flush she said\nPatrick would you mind... theres a new bottle in the cupboard in the\npantry... Bring it and a corkscrew.",
    "I  we  might as well have a new\nbottle.",
    "This  this has been opened some time.",
    "Patrick went on his errand without a word.",
    "He returned with the new\nbottle and drew the cork.",
    "He looked up curiously at Miss Blacklog as he\nplaced it on the tray.",
    "Taking things seriously arent you darling he asked gently.",
    "Oh cried Dora Bunner shocked.",
    "Surely Letty you cant imagine \n\nHush said Miss Blacklog quickly.",
    "Thats the bell.",
    "You see my\nintelligent anticipation is being justified.",
    "II\n\n\fMitzi opened the door of the drawingroom and admitted Colonel and\nMrs. Easterbrook.",
    "She had her own methods of announcing people.",
    "Here is Colonel and Mrs. Easterbrook to see you she said\nconversationally.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook was very bluff and breezy to cover some slight\nembarrassment.",
    "Hope you dont mind us dropping in he said.",
    "A subdued gurgle came\nfrom Julia.",
    "Happened to be passing this way  eh what Quite a mild\nevening.",
    "Notice youve got your central heating on.",
    "We havent started\nours yet.",
    "Arent your chrysanthemums lovely gushed Mrs. Easterbrook.",
    "Such\nbeauties\n\nTheyre rather scraggy really said Julia.",
    "Mrs. Easterbrook greeted Phillipa Haymes with a little extra cordiality\nto show that she quite understood that Phillipa was not really an\nagricultural labourer.",
    "How is Mrs. Lucass garden getting on she asked.",
    "Do you think it\nwill ever be straight again Completely neglected all through the war and then only that dreadful old man Ashe who simply did nothing but\nsweep up a few leaves and put in a few cabbage plants.",
    "Its yielding to treatment said Phillipa.",
    "But it will take a little time.",
    "Mitzi opened the door again and said Here are the ladies from\nBoulders.",
    "Evening said Miss Hinchliffe striding over and taking Miss\nBlacklogs hand in her formidable grip.",
    "I said to Murgatroyd Lets just\ndrop in at Little Paddocks.",
    "I wanted to ask you how your ducks are\nlaying.",
    "The evenings do draw in so quickly now dont they said Miss\nMurgatroyd to Patrick in a rather fluttery way.",
    "What lovely\nchrysanthemums\n\nScraggy  said Julia.",
    "Why cant you be cooperative murmured Patrick to her in a\nreproachful aside.",
    "Youve got your central heating on said Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "She said it\naccusingly.",
    "Very early.",
    "The house gets so damp this time of year said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Patrick signalled with his eyebrows Sherry yet and Miss Blacklog\nsignalled back Not yet.",
    "She said to Colonel Easterbrook Are you getting any bulbs from\nHolland this year\n\n\fThe door again opened and Mrs. Swettenham came in rather guiltily\nfollowed by a scowling and uncomfortable Edmund.",
    "Here we are said Mrs. Swettenham gaily gazing round her with frank\ncuriosity.",
    "Then feeling suddenly uncomfortable she went on I just\nthought Id pop in and ask you if by any chance you wanted a kitten\nMiss Blacklog Our cat is just \n\nAbout to be brought to bed of the progeny of a ginger tom said\nEdmund.",
    "The result will I think be frightful.",
    "Dont say you havent been\nwarned\n\nShes a very good mouser said Mrs. Swettenham hastily.",
    "And added\nWhat lovely chrysanthemums\n\nYouve got your central heating on havent you asked Edmund with\nan air of originality.",
    "Arent people just like gramophone records murmured Julia.",
    "I dont like the news said Colonel Easterbrook to Patrick buttonholing him fiercely.",
    "I dont like it at all.",
    "If you ask me wars inevitable absolutely inevitable.",
    "I never pay any attention to news said Patrick.",
    "Once more the door opened and Mrs. Harmon came in.",
    "Her battered felt hat was stuck on the back of her head in a vague\nattempt to be fashionable and she had put on a rather limp frilly blouse\ninstead of her usual pullover.",
    "Hallo Miss Blacklog she exclaimed beaming all over her round face.",
    "Im not too late am I When does the murder begin\n\nIII\n\nThere was an audible series of gasps.",
    "Julia gave an approving little\ngiggle Patrick crinkled up his face and Miss Blacklog smiled at her\nlatest guest.",
    "Julian is just frantic with rage that he cant be here said Mrs. Harmon.",
    "He adores murders.",
    "Thats really why he preached such a good\nsermon last Sunday.",
    "I suppose I oughtnt to say it was a good sermon as\nhes my husband but it really was good didnt you think so much\nbetter than his usual sermons.",
    "But as I was saying it was all because of\nDeath Does the Hat Trick.",
    "Have you read it The girl at Boots kept it for\nme specially.",
    "Its simply baffling.",
    "You keep thinking you know and then\nthe whole thing switches round and there are a lovely lot of murders\nfour or five of them.",
    "Well I left it in the study when Julian was shutting\nhimself up there to do his sermon and he just picked it up and simply\ncould not put it down And consequently he had to write his sermon in a\nfrightful hurry and had to just put down what he wanted to say very\nsimply without any scholarly twists and bits and learned references \n\n\fand naturally it was heaps better.",
    "Oh dear Im talking too much.",
    "But do\ntell me when is the murder going to begin\n\nMiss Blacklog looked at the clock on the mantelpiece.",
    "If its going to begin she said cheerfully it ought to begin soon.",
    "Its\njust a minute to the half hour.",
    "In the meantime have a glass of sherry.",
    "Patrick moved with alacrity through the archway.",
    "Miss Blacklog went to the table by the archway where the cigarettebox\nwas.",
    "Id love some sherry said Mrs. Harmon.",
    "But what do you mean by\nif\n\nWell said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Im as much in the dark as you are.",
    "I dont\nknow what \n\nShe stopped and turned her head as the little clock on the mantelpiece\nbegan to chime.",
    "It had a sweet silvery belllike tone.",
    "Everybody was\nsilent and nobody moved.",
    "They all stared at the clock.",
    "It chimed a quarter  and then the half.",
    "As the last note died away all the\nlights went out.",
    "IV\n\n\fDelighted gasps and feminine squeaks of appreciation were heard in\nthe darkness.",
    "Its beginning cried Mrs. Harmon in an ecstasy.",
    "Dora\nBunners voice cried out plaintively Oh I dont like it Other voices\nsaid How terribly terribly frightening It gives me the creeps.",
    "Archie where are you What do I have to do Oh dear  did I step\non your foot Im so sorry.",
    "Then with a crash the door swung open.",
    "A powerful flashlight played\nrapidly round the room.",
    "A mans hoarse nasal voice reminiscent to all\nof pleasant afternoons at the cinema directed the company crisply to\nStick em up\n\nStick em up I tell you the voice barked.",
    "Delightedly hands were\nraised willingly above heads.",
    "Isnt it wonderful breathed a female voice.",
    "Im so thrilled.",
    "And then unexpectedly a revolver spoke.",
    "It spoke twice.",
    "The ping of\ntwo bullets shattered the complacency of the room.",
    "Suddenly the game\nwas no longer a game.",
    "Somebody screamed...",
    "The figure in the doorway whirled suddenly round it seemed to hesitate\na third shot rang out it crumpled and then it crashed to the ground.",
    "The\nflashlight dropped and went out.",
    "There was darkness once again.",
    "And gently with a little Victorian\nprotesting moan the drawingroom door as was its habit when not\npropped open swung gently to and latched with a click.",
    "V\n\nInside the drawingroom there was pandemonium.",
    "Various voices\nspoke at once.",
    "Lights.",
    "Cant you find the switch\n\nWhos got a lighter\n\nOh I dont like it I dont like it.",
    "But those shots were real\n\nIt was a real revolver he had.",
    "Was it a burglar\n\nOh Archie I want to get out of here.",
    "Please has somebody got a lighter\n\nAnd then almost at the same moment two lighters clicked and burned\nwith small steady flames.",
    "Everybody blinked and peered at each other.",
    "Startled face looked into\nstartled face.",
    "Against the wall by the archway Miss Blacklog stood with\nher hand up to her face.",
    "The light was too dim to show more than that\nsomething dark was trickling over her fingers.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook cleared his throat and rose to the occasion.",
    "Try the switches Swettenham he ordered.",
    "Edmund near the door obediently jerked the switch up and down.",
    "Off at the main or a fuse said the Colonel.",
    "Whos making that awful\nrow\n\nA female voice had been screaming steadily from somewhere beyond\nthe closed door.",
    "It rose now in pitch and with it came the sound of fists\nhammering on a door.",
    "Dora Bunner who had been sobbing quietly called out Its Mitzi.",
    "Somebodys murdering Mitzi...\n\nPatrick muttered No such luck.",
    "Miss Blacklog said We must get candles.",
    "Patrick will you \n\nThe Colonel was already opening the door.",
    "He and Edmund their\nlighters flickering stepped into the hall.",
    "They almost stumbled over a recumbent figure there.",
    "Seems to have knocked him out said the Colonel.",
    "Wheres that\nwoman making that hellish noise\n\nIn the diningroom said Edmund.",
    "The diningroom was just across the hall.",
    "Someone was beating on the\npanels and howling and screaming.",
    "Shes locked in said Edmund stooping down.",
    "He turned the key and\nMitzi came out like a bounding tiger.",
    "The diningroom light was still on.",
    "Silhouetted against it Mitzi presented\na picture of insane terror and continued to scream.",
    "A touch of comedy\nwas introduced by the fact that she had been engaged in cleaning silver\nand was still holding a chamois leather and a large fish slice.",
    "Be quiet Mitzi said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Stop it said Edmund and as Mitzi showed no disposition to stop\nscreaming he leaned forward and gave her a sharp slap on the cheek.",
    "Mitzi gasped and hiccupped into silence.",
    "Get some candles said Miss Blacklog.",
    "In the kitchen cupboard.",
    "Patrick you know where the fusebox is\n\nThe passage behind the scullery Right Ill see what I can do.",
    "Miss Blacklog had moved forward into the light thrown from the diningroom and Dora Bunner gave a sobbing gasp.",
    "Mitzi let out another fullblooded scream.",
    "The blood the blood she gasped.",
    "You are shot  Miss Blacklog you\nbleed to death.",
    "Dont be so stupid snapped Miss Blacklog.",
    "Im hardly hurt at all.",
    "It\njust grazed my ear.",
    "But Aunt Letty said Julia the blood.",
    "And indeed Miss Blacklogs white blouse and pearls and her hand were\na horrifyingly gory sight.",
    "Ears always bleed said Miss Blacklog.",
    "I remember fainting in the\nhairdressers when I was a child.",
    "The man had only just snipped my ear.",
    "There seemed to be a basin of blood at once.",
    "But we must have some\nlight.",
    "I get the candles said Mitzi.",
    "Julia went with her and they returned with several candles stuck into\nsaucers.",
    "Now lets have a look at our malefactor said the Colonel.",
    "Hold the\ncandles down low will you Swettenham As many as you can.",
    "Ill come the other side said Phillipa.",
    "With a steady hand she took a couple of saucers.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook\nknelt down.",
    "The recumbent figure was draped in a roughlymade black cloak with a\nhood to it.",
    "There was a black mask over the face and he wore black\ncotton gloves.",
    "The hood had slipped back disclosing a ruffled fair head.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook turned him over felt the pulse the heart... then\ndrew away his fingers with an exclamation of distaste looking down on\nthem.",
    "They were sticky and red.",
    "Shot himself he said.",
    "Is he badly hurt asked Miss Blacklog\n\nHm.",
    "Im afraid hes dead... May have been suicide  or he may have\ntripped himself up with that cloak thing and the revolver went off as he\nfell.",
    "If I could see better \n\nAt that moment as though by magic the lights came on again.",
    "With a queer feeling of unreality those inhabitants of Chipping Cleghorn\nwho stood in the hall of Little Paddocks realised that they stood in the\npresence of violent and sudden death.",
    "Colonel Easterbrooks hand was\nstained red.",
    "Blood was still trickling down Miss Blacklogs neck over\nher blouse and coat and the grotesquely sprawled figure of the\nintruder lay at their feet...\n\n\fPatrick coming from the diningroom said It seemed to be just one\nfuse gone...",
    "He stopped.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook tugged at the small\nblack mask.",
    "Better see who the fellow is he said.",
    "Though I dont suppose its\nanyone we know...",
    "He detached the mask.",
    "Necks were craned forward.",
    "Mitzi hiccupped\nand gasped but the others were very quiet.",
    "Hes quite young said Mrs. Harmon with a note of pity in her voice.",
    "And suddenly Dora Bunner cried out excitedly\n\nLetty Letty its the young man from the Spa Hotel in Medenham Wells.",
    "The one who came out here and wanted you to give him money to get\nback to Switzerland and you refused.",
    "I suppose the whole thing was\njust a pretext  to spy out the house... Oh dear  he might easily have\nkilled you...\n\nChapter 4\n\nTHE ROYAL SPA HOTEL\n\nGeorge Rydesdale Chief Constable of Middleshire was a quiet man.",
    "Of\nmedium height with shrewd eyes under rather bushy brows he was in\n\n\fthe habit of listening rather than talking.",
    "Then in his unemotional voice\nhe would give a brief order  and the order was obeyed.",
    "He was listening now to DetectiveInspector Dermot Craddock.",
    "Craddock was now officially in charge of the case.",
    "Rydesdale had\nrecalled him last night from Liverpool where he had been sent to make\ncertain inquiries in connection with another case.",
    "Rydesdale had a\ngood opinion of Craddock.",
    "He not only had brains and imagination he\nhad also which Rydesdale appreciated even more the selfdiscipline\nto go slow to check and examine each fact and to keep an open mind\nuntil the very end of a case.",
    "Constable Legg took the call sir Craddock was saying.",
    "He seems to\nhave acted very well with promptitude and presence of mind.",
    "And it\ncant have been easy.",
    "About a dozen people all trying to talk at once\nincluding one of those Mittel Europas who go off at the deep end at the\nmere sight of a policeman.",

    "Deceased has been identified\n\nYes sir.",
    "Rudi Scherz.",
    "Swiss Nationality.",
    "Employed at the Royal Spa\nHotel Medenham Wells as a receptionist.",
    "If you agree sir I thought Id\ntake the Royal Spa Hotel first and go out to Chipping Cleghorn\nafterwards.",
    "Sergeant Fletcher is out there now.",
    "Hell see the bus people\nand then go on to the house.",
    "Rydesdale nodded approval.",
    "The door opened and the Chief Constable looked up.",
    "Come in Henry he said.",
    "Weve got something here thats a little out\nof the ordinary.",
    "Sir Henry Clithering exCommissioner of Scotland Yard came in with\nslightly raised eyebrows.",
    "He was a tall distinguishedlooking elderly\nman.",
    "It may appeal to even your blas\u00e9 palate went on Rydesdale.",
    "I was never blas\u00e9 said Sir Henry indignantly.",
    "The latest idea said Rydesdale is to advertise ones murders\nbeforehand.",
    "Show Sir Henry that advertisement Craddock.",
    "The North Benham News and Chipping Cleghorn Gazette said Sir\nHenry.",
    "Quite a mouthful.",
    "He read the halfinch of print indicated by\nCraddocks finger.",
    "Hm yes somewhat unusual.",
    "Any line on who inserted this advertisement asked Rydesdale.",
    "By the description sir it was handed in by Rudi Scherz himself  on\nWednesday.",
    "Nobody questioned it The person who accepted it didnt think it\nodd\n\n\fThe adenoidal blonde who receives the advertisements is quite\nincapable of thinking I should say sir.",
    "She just counted the words and\ntook the money.",
    "What was the idea asked Sir Henry.",
    "Get a lot of the locals curious suggested Rydesdale.",
    "Get them all together at a particular place at a particular time then\nhold them up and relieve them of their spare cash and valuables.",
    "As an\nidea its not without originality.",
    "What sort of a place is Chipping Cleghorn asked Sir Henry.",

    "A certain amount of building done\nround about in Victorian times.",
    "I know said Sir Henry.",
    "Nice old Pussies and retired Colonels.",
    "Yes if\nthey noticed that advertisement theyd all come sniffing round at 630 to\nsee what was up.",
    "Lord I wish I had my own particular old Pussy here.",
    "Wouldnt she like to get her nice ladylike teeth into this.",
    "Right up her\nstreet it would be.",
    "Whos your own particular Pussy Henry An aunt\n\n\fNo Sir Henry sighed.",
    "Shes no relation.",
    "He said reverently Shes\njust the finest detective God ever made.",
    "Natural genius cultivated in a\nsuitable soil.",
    "He turned upon Craddock.",
    "Dont you despise the old Pussies in this village of yours my boy he\nsaid.",
    "In case this turns out to be a high powered mystery which I dont\nsuppose for a moment it will remember that an elderly unmarried\nwoman who knits and gardens is streets ahead of any detective\nsergeant.",
    "She can tell you what might have happened and what ought\nto have happened and even what actually did happen And she can tell\nyou why it happened\n\nIll bear that in mind sir said DetectiveInspector Craddock in his\nmost formal manner and nobody would have guessed that Dermot Eric\nCraddock was actually Sir Henrys godson and was on easy and\nintimate terms with his godfather.",
    "Rydesdale gave a quick outline of the case to his friend.",
    "Theyd all turn up at 630 I grant you that he said.",
    "But would that\nSwiss fellow know they would And another thing would they be likely\nto have much loot on them to be worth the taking\n\nA couple of oldfashioned brooches a string of seed pearls  a little\nloose change perhaps a note or two  not more said Sir Henry\nthoughtfully.",
    "Did this Miss Blacklog keep much money in the house\n\n\fShe says not sir.",
    "Five pounds odd I understand.",
    "Mere chicken feed said Rydesdale.",
    "What youre getting at said Sir Henry is that this fellow liked to\nplayact  it wasnt the loot it was the fun of playing and acting the holdup.",
    "Cinema stuff Eh Its quite possible.",
    "How did he manage to shoot\nhimself\n\nRydesdale drew a paper towards him.",
    "Preliminary medical report.",
    "The revolver was discharged at close\nrange  singeing... hm... nothing to show whether accident or suicide.",
    "Could have been done deliberately or he could have tripped and fallen\nand the revolver which he was holding close to him could have gone\noff...",
    "Probably the latter.",
    "He looked at Craddock.",
    "Youll have to\nquestion the witnesses very carefully and make them say exactly what\nthey saw.",
    "DetectiveInspector Craddock said sadly Theyll all have seen\nsomething different.",
    "Its always interested me said Sir Henry what people do see at a\nmoment of intense excitement and nervous strain.",
    "What they do see\nand even more interesting what they dont see.",
    "Wheres the report on the revolver\n\n\fForeign make  fairly common on the Continent  Scherz did not hold\na permit for it  and did not declare it on coming into England.",
    "Bad lad said Sir Henry.",
    "Unsatisfactory character all round.",
    "Well Craddock go and see what\nyou can find out about him at the Royal Spa Hotel.",
    "II\n\nAt the Royal Spa Hotel Inspector Craddock was taken straight to the\nManagers office.",
    "The Manager Mr. Rowlandson a tall florid man with a hearty manner\ngreeted Inspector Craddock with expansive geniality.",
    "Glad to help you\nin any way we can Inspector he said.",
    "Really a most surprising\nbusiness.",
    "Id never have credited it  never.",
    "Scherz seemed a very\nordinary pleasant young chap  not at all my idea of a holdup man.",
    "How long has he been with you Mr. Rowlandson\n\nI was looking that up just before you came.",
    "A little over three months.",
    "Quite good credentials the usual permits etc.",
    "And you found him satisfactory\n\nWithout seeming to do so Craddock marked the infinitesimal pause\nbefore Rowlandson replied.",
    "Quite satisfactory.",
    "Craddock made use of a technique he had found efficacious before now.",
    "No no Mr. Rowlandson he said gently shaking his head.",
    "Thats not\nreally quite the case is it\n\nWell  The Manager seemed slightly taken aback.",
    "Come now there was something wrong.",
    "What was it\n\nThats just it.",
    "I dont know.",
    "But you thought there was something wrong\n\nWell  yes  I did...",
    "But Ive nothing really to go upon.",
    "I shouldnt like my\nconjectures to be written down and quoted against me.",
    "Craddock smiled pleasantly.",
    "I know just what you mean.",
    "You neednt worry.",
    "But Ive got to get some\nidea of what this fellow Scherz was like.",
    "You suspected him of what\n\nRowlandson said rather reluctantly Well there was trouble once or\ntwice about the bills.",
    "Items charged that oughtnt to have been there.",
    "You mean you suspected that he charged up certain items which didnt\nappear in the hotel records and that he pocketed the difference when\nthe bill was paid\n\n\fSomething like that...",
    "Put it at the best there was gross carelessness\non his part.",
    "Once or twice quite a big sum was involved.",
    "Frankly I got\nour accountant to go over his books suspecting that he was  well a\nwrong un but though there were various mistakes and a good deal of\nslipshod method the actual cash was quite correct.",
    "So I came to the\nconclusion that I must be mistaken.",
    "Supposing you hadnt been wrong Supposing Scherz had been\nhelping himself to various small sums here and there he could have\ncovered himself I suppose by making good the money\n\nYes if he had the money.",
    "But people who help themselves to small\nsums  as you put it  are usually hard up for those sums and spend\nthem offhand.",
    "So if he wanted money to replace missing sums he would have had to\nget money  by a holdup or other means\n\nYes.",
    "I wonder if this is his first attempt...\n\nMight be.",
    "It was certainly a very amateurish one.",
    "Is there anyone else\nhe could have got money from Any women in his life\n\nOne of the waitresses in the Grill.",
    "Her names Myrna Harris.",
    "Id better have a talk with her.",
    "Myrna Harris was a pretty girl with a glorious head of red hair and a\npert nose.",
    "She was alarmed and wary and deeply conscious of the indignity of\nbeing interviewed by the police.",
    "I dont know a thing about it sir.",
    "Not a thing she protested.",
    "If Id\nknown what he was like Id never have gone out with Rudi at all.",
    "Naturally seeing as he worked in Reception here I thought he was all\nright.",
    "Naturally I did.",
    "What I say is the hotel ought to be more careful\nwhen they employ people  especially foreigners.",
    "Because you never\nknow where you are with foreigners.",
    "I suppose he might have been in\nwith one of these gangs you read about\n\nWe think said Craddock that he was working quite on his own.",
    "Fancy  and him so quiet and respectable.",
    "Youd never think.",
    "Though\nthere have been things missed now I come to think of it.",
    "A diamond\nbrooch and a little gold locket I believe.",
    "But I never dreamed that it\ncould have been Rudi.",
    "Im sure you didnt said Craddock.",
    "Anyone might have been taken in.",
    "You knew him fairly well\n\nI dont know that Id say well.",
    "But you were friendly\n\n\fOh we were friendly  thats all just friendly.",
    "Nothing serious at all.",
    "Im\nalways on my guard with foreigners anyway.",
    "Theyve often got a way\nwith them but you never know do you Some of those Poles during the\nwar And even some of the Americans Never let on theyre married\nmen until its too late.",
    "Rudi talked big and all that  but I always took it\nwith a grain of salt.",
    "Craddock seized on the phrase.",
    "Talked big did he Thats very interesting Miss Harris.",
    "I can see\nyoure going to be a lot of help to us.",
    "In what way did he talk big\n\nWell about how rich his people were in Switzerland\n\n and how\n\nimportant.",
    "But that didnt go with his being as short of money as he was.",
    "He always said that because of the money regulation he couldnt get\nmoney from Switzerland over here.",
    "That might be I suppose but his\nthings werent expensive.",
    "His clothes I mean.",
    "They werent really class.",
    "I think too that a lot of the stories he used to tell me were so much hot\nair.",
    "About climbing in the Alps and saving peoples lives on the edge of\na glacier.",
    "Why he turned quite giddy just going along the edge of\nBoulters Gorge.",
    "Alps indeed\n\nYou went out with him a good deal\n\nYes  well  yes I did.",
    "He had awfully good manners and he knew how\nto  to look after a girl.",
    "The best seats at the pictures always.",
    "And even\nflowers hed buy me sometimes.",
    "And he was just a lovely dancer lovely.",
    "Did he mention this Miss Blacklog to you at all\n\nShe comes in and lunches here sometimes doesnt she And shes\nstayed here once.",
    "No I dont think Rudi ever mentioned her.",
    "I didnt\nknow he knew her.",
    "Did he mention Chipping Cleghorn\n\nHe thought a faintly wary look came into Myrna Harriss eyes but he\ncouldnt be sure.",
    "I dont think so...",
    "I think he did once ask about buses  what time they\nwent  but I cant remember if that was Chipping Cleghorn or\nsomewhere else.",
    "It wasnt just lately.",
    "He couldnt get more out of her.",
    "Rudi Scherz had seemed just as usual.",
    "She hadnt seen him the evening before.",
    "Shed no idea  no idea at all she stressed the point that Rudi Scherz was a crook.",
    "And probably Craddock thought that was quite true.",
    "Chapter 5 MISS BLACKLOG AND MISS BUNNER\n\nLittle Paddocks was very much as DetectiveInspector Craddock had\nimagined it to be.",
    "He noted ducks and chickens and what had been until\nlately an attractive herbaceous border and in which a few late\nMichaelmas daisies showed a last dying splash of purple beauty.",
    "The\nlawn and the paths showed signs of neglect.",
    "Summing up DetectiveInspector Craddock thought Probably not\nmuch money to spend on gardeners  fond of flowers and a good eye for\nplanning and massing a border.",
    "House needs painting.",
    "Most houses do\nnowadays.",
    "Pleasant little property.",
    "As Craddocks car stopped before the front door Sergeant Fletcher\ncame round the side of the house.",
    "Sergeant FIetcher looked like a\nguardsman with an erect military bearing and was able to impart\nseveral different meanings to the one monosyllable Sir.",
    "So there you are Fletcher.",
    "Sir said Sergeant Fletcher.",
    "Anything to report\n\nWeve finished going over the house sir Scherz doesnt seem to have\nleft any fingerprints anywhere.",
    "He wore gloves of course.",
    "No signs of\nany of the doors or windows being forced to effect an entrance.",
    "He\nseems to have come out from Medenham on the bus arriving here at six\noclock.",
    "Side door of the house was locked at 530 I understand.",
    "Looks\nas though he must have walked in through the front door.",
    "Miss Blacklog\nstates that that door isnt usually locked until the house is shut up for\nthe night.",
    "The maid on the other hand states that the front door was\nlocked all the afternoon  but shed say anything.",
    "Very temperamental\nyoull find her.",
    "MittelEuropa refugee of some kind.",
    "Difficult is she\n\n\fSir said Sergeant Fletcher with intense feeling.",
    "Craddock smiled.",
    "Fletcher resumed his report.",
    "Lighting system is quite in order everywhere.",
    "We havent spotted yet\nhow he operated the lights.",
    "It was just the one circuit went.",
    "Drawingroom and hall.",
    "Of course nowadays the wall brackets and lamps\nwouldnt all be on one fuse  but this is an oldfashioned installation and\nwiring.",
    "Dont see how he could have tampered with the fusebox\nbecause its out by the scullery and hed have had to go through the\nkitchen so the maid would have seen him.",
    "Unless she was in it with him\n\nThats very possible.",
    "Both foreigners  and I wouldnt trust her a yard not a yard.",
    "Craddock noticed two enormous frightened black eyes peering out of a\nwindow by the front door.",
    "The face flattened against the pane was\nhardly visible.",
    "That her there\n\nThats right sir.",
    "The face disappeared.",
    "Craddock rang the frontdoor bell.",
    "After a long wait the door was opened by a goodlooking young woman\nwith chestnut hair and a bored expression.",
    "DetectiveInspector Craddock said Craddock.",
    "The young woman gave him a cool stare out of very attractive hazel\neyes and said Come in.",
    "Miss Blacklog is expecting you.",
    "The hall Craddock noted was long and narrow and seemed almost\nincredibly full of doors.",
    "The young woman threw open a door on the left and said Inspector\nCraddock Aunt Letty.",
    "Mitzi wouldnt go to the door.",
    "Shes shut herself\nup in the kitchen and shes making the most marvellous moaning noises.",
    "I shouldnt think wed get any lunch.",
    "She added in an explanatory manner to Craddock She doesnt like the\npolice and withdrew shutting the door behind her.",
    "Craddock advanced to meet the owner of Little Paddocks.",
    "He saw a tall activelooking woman of about sixty.",
    "Her grey hair had a\nslight natural wave and made a distinguished setting for an intelligent\nresolute face.",
    "She had keen grey eyes and a square determined chin.",
    "There was a surgical dressing on her left ear.",
    "She wore no makeup\nand was plainly dressed in a wellcut tweed coat and skirt and pullover.",
    "Round the neck of the latter she wore rather unexpectedly a set of oldfashioned cameos  a Victorian touch which seemed to hint at a\nsentimental streak not otherwise apparent.",
    "Close beside her with an eager round face and untidy hair escaping\nfrom a hair net was a woman of about the same age whom Craddock\nhad no difficulty in recognising as the Dora Bunner  companion of\nConstable Leggs notes  to which the latter had added an offtherecord commentary of Scatty\n\nMiss Blacklog spoke in a pleasant wellbred voice.",
    "Good morning Inspector Craddock.",
    "This is my friend Miss Bunner\nwho helps me run the house.",
    "Wont you sit down You wont smoke I\nsuppose\n\nNot on duty Im afraid Miss Blacklog.",
    "What a shame\n\nCraddocks eyes took in the room with a quick practised glance.",
    "Typical Victorian double drawingroom.",
    "Two long windows in this room\nbuilt out bay window in the other... chairs... sofa... centre table with a\nbig bowl of chrysanthemums  another bowl in window  all fresh and\npleasant without much originality.",
    "The only incongruous note was a\nsmall silver vase with dead violets in it on a table near the archway into\nthe further room.",
    "Since he could not imagine Miss Blacklog tolerating\ndead flowers in a room he imagined it to be the only indication that\nsomething out of the way had occurred to distract the routine of a wellrun household.",
    "He said I take it Miss Blacklog that this is the room in which the incident occurred\n\nYes.",
    "And you should have seen it last night Miss Bunner exclaimed.",
    "Such\na mess.",
    "Two little tables knocked over and the leg off one  people\nbarging about in the dark  and someone put down a lighted cigarette\nand burnt one of the best bits of furniture.",
    "People  young people\nespecially are so  careless about these things... Luckily none of the\nchina got broken  Miss Blacklog interrupted gently but firmly Dora\nall these things vexatious as they may be are only trifles.",
    "It will be best\nI think if we just answer Inspector Craddocks questions.",
    "Thank you Miss Blacklog.",
    "I shall come to what happened last night\npresently.",
    "First of all I want you to tell me when you first saw the dead\nman  Rudi Scherz.",
    "Rudi Scherz Miss Blacklog looked slightly surprised.",
    "Is that his\nname Somehow I thought... Oh well it doesnt matter.",
    "My first\nencounter with him was when I was in Medenham Spa for a days\nshopping about  let me see about three weeks ago.",
    "We  Miss Bunner\nand I  were having lunch at the Royal Spa Hotel.",
    "As we were just\nleaving after lunch I heard my name spoken.",
    "It was this young man.",
    "He\nsaid It is Miss Blacklog is it not And went on to say that perhaps I did\nnot remember him but that he was the son of the proprietor of the Hotel\ndes Alpes at Montreux where my sister and I had stayed for nearly a\nyear during the war.",
    "The Hotel des Alpes Montreux noted Craddock.",
    "And did you\nremember him Miss Blacklog\n\nNo I didnt.",
    "Actually I had no recollection of ever having seen him\nbefore.",
    "These boys at hotel reception desks all look exactly alike.",
    "We\nhad had a very pleasant time at Montreux and the proprietor there had\nbeen extremely obliging so I tried to be as civil as possible and said I\nhoped he was enjoying being in England and he said yes that his\nfather had sent him over for six months to learn the hotel business.",
    "It all\nseemed quite natural.",
    "And your next encounter\n\nAbout  yes it must have been ten days ago he suddenly turned up\nhere.",
    "I was very surprised to see him.",
    "He apologised for troubling me\nbut said I was the only person he knew in England.",
    "He told me that he\nurgently needed money to return to Switzerland as his mother was\ndangerously ill.",
    "But Letty didnt give it to him Miss Bunner put in breathlessly.",
    "It was a thoroughly fishy story said Miss Blacklog with vigour.",
    "I\nmade up my mind that he was definitely a wrong un.",
    "That story about\nwanting the money to return to Switzerland was nonsense.",
    "His father\ncould easily have wired for arrangements to have been made in this\ncountry.",
    "These hotel people are all in with each other.",
    "I suspected that\nhed been embezzling money or something of that kind.",
    "She paused\nand said dryly In case you think Im hardhearted I was secretary for\n\n\fmany years to a big financier and one becomes wary about appeals for\nmoney.",
    "I know simply all the hard luck stories there are.",
    "The only thing that did surprise me she added thoughtfully was that\nhe gave in so easily.",
    "He went away at once without any more argument.",
    "Its as though he had never expected to get the money.",
    "Do you think now looking back on it that his coming was really by way\nof a pretext to spy out the land\n\nMiss Blacklog nodded her head vigorously.",
    "Thats exactly what I do think  now.",
    "He made certain remarks as I let\nhim out  about the rooms.",
    "He said You have a very nice diningroom\nwhich of course it isnt  its a horrid dark little room just as an excuse\nto look inside.",
    "And then he sprang forward and unfastened the front\ndoor said Let me.",
    "I think now he wanted to have a look at the\nfastening.",
    "Actually like most people round here we never lock the\nfront door until it gets dark.",
    "Anyone could walk in.",
    "And the side door There is a side door to the garden I understand\n\nYes.",
    "I went out through it to shut up the ducks not long before the\npeople arrived.",
    "Was it locked when you went out\n\nMiss Blacklog frowned.",
    "I cant remember...",
    "I think so.",
    "I certainly locked it when I came in.",
    "That would be about quarterpast six\n\nSomewhere about then.",
    "And the front door\n\nThats not usually locked until later.",
    "Then Scherz could have walked in quite easily that way.",
    "Or he could\nhave slipped in whilst you were out shutting up the ducks.",
    "Hed already\nspied out the lie of the land and had probably noted various places of\nconcealment  cupboards etc.",
    "Yes that all seems quite clear.",
    "I beg your pardon it isnt at all clear said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Why on\nearth should anyone take all that elaborate trouble to come and burgle\nthis house and stage that silly sort of holdup\n\nDo you keep much money in the house Miss Blacklog\n\nAbout five pounds in that desk there and perhaps a pound or two in\nmy purse.",
    "Jewellery\n\nA couple of rings and brooches and the cameos Im wearing.",
    "You must\nagree with me Inspector that the whole things absurd.",
    "It wasnt burglary at all cried Miss Bunner.",
    "Ive told you so Letty all\nalong.",
    "It was revenge Because you wouldnt give him that money He\ndeliberately shot at you  twice.",
    "Ah said Craddock.",
    "Well come now to last night.",
    "What happened\nexactly Miss Blacklog Tell me in your own words as nearly as you can\nremember.",
    "Miss Blacklog reflected a moment.",
    "The clock struck she said.",
    "The one on the mantelpiece.",
    "I remember\nsaying that if anything were going to happen it would have to happen\nsoon.",
    "And then the clock struck.",
    "We all listened to it without saying\nanything.",
    "It chimes you know.",
    "It chimed the two quarters and then\nquite suddenly the lights went out.",
    "What lights were on\n\nThe wall brackets in here and the further room.",
    "The standard lamp and\nthe two small reading lamps werent on.",
    "Was there a flash first or a noise when the lights went out\n\nI dont think so.",
    "Im sure there was a flash said Dora Bunner.",
    "And a crackling noise.",
    "Dangerous\n\nAnd then Miss Blacklog\n\n\fThe door opened\n\nWhich door There are two in the room.",
    "Oh this door in here.",
    "The one in the other room doesnt open.",
    "Its a\ndummy.",
    "The door opened and there he was  a masked man with a\nrevolver.",
    "It just seemed too fantastic for words but of course at the\ntime I just thought it was a silly joke.",
    "He said something  I forget what\n\nHands up or I shoot supplied Miss Bunner dramatically.",
    "Something like that said Miss Blacklog rather doubtfully.",
    "And you all put your hands up\n\nOh yes said Miss Bunner.",
    "We all did.",
    "I mean it was part of it.",
    "I didnt said Miss Blacklog crisply.",
    "It seemed so utterly silly.",
    "And I\nwas annoyed by the whole thing.",
    "And then\n\nThe flashlight was right in my eyes.",
    "It dazzled me.",
    "And then quite\nincredibly I heard a bullet whizz past me and hit the wall by my head.",
    "Somebody shrieked and then I felt a burning pain in my ear and heard\nthe second report.",
    "It was terrifying put in Miss Bunner.",
    "And what happened next Miss Blacklog\n\nIts difficult to say  I was so staggered by the pain and the surprise.",
    "The  the figure turned away and seemed to stumble and then there was\nanother shot and his torch went out and everybody began pushing and\ncalling out.",
    "All banging into each other.",
    "Where were you standing Miss Blacklog\n\nShe was over by the table.",
    "Shed got that vase of violets in her hand\nsaid Miss Bunner breathlessly.",
    "I was over here Miss Blacklog went over to the small table by the\narchway.",
    "Actually it was the cigarettebox Id got in my hand.",
    "Inspector Craddock examined the wall behind her.",
    "The two bullet holes\nshowed plainly.",
    "The bullets themselves had been extracted and had\nbeen sent for comparison with the revolver.",
    "He said quietly You had a very near escape Miss Blacklog.",
    "He did shoot at her said Miss Bunner.",
    "Deliberately at her I saw him.",
    "He turned the flash round on everybody until he found her and then he\nheld it right at her and just fired at her.",
    "He meant to kill you Letty.",
    "Dora dear youve just got that into your head from mulling the whole\nthing over and over.",
    "He shot at you repeated Dora stubbornly.",
    "He meant to shoot you\nand when hed missed he shot himself.",
    "Im certain thats the way it\nwas\n\nI dont think he meant to shoot himself for a minute said Miss\nBlacklog.",
    "He wasnt the kind of man who shoots himself.",
    "You tell me Miss Blacklog that until the revolver was fired you thought\nthe whole business was a joke\n\nNaturally.",
    "What else could I think it was\n\nWho do you think was the author of this joke\n\nYou thought Patrick had done it at first Dora Bunner reminded her.",
    "Patrick asked the Inspector sharply.",
    "My young cousin Patrick Simmons Miss Blacklog continued sharply\nannoyed with her friend.",
    "It did occur to me when I saw this\nadvertisement that it might be some attempt at humour on his part but\nhe denied it absolutely.",
    "And then you were worried Letty said Miss Bunner.",
    "You were\nworried although you pretended not to be.",
    "And you were quite right to\nbe worried.",
    "It said a murder is announced  and it was announced  your\nmurder And if the man hadnt missed you would have been murdered.",

    "I rely on you you know to keep the\nhouse going.",
    "Isnt it the day for the laundry to come\n\nOh dear me Letty how fortunate you reminded me I wonder if theyll\nreturn that missing pillowcase.",
    "I must make a note in the book about it.",
    "Ill go and see to it at once.",
    "And take those violets away said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Theres nothing I\nhate more than dead flowers.",
    "What a pity.",
    "I picked them fresh yesterday.",
    "They havent lasted at all oh dear I must have forgotten to put any water in the vase.",
    "Fancy that\nIm always forgetting things.",
    "Now I must go and see about the laundry.",
    "They might be here any moment.",
    "She bustled away looking quite happy again.",
    "Shes not very strong said Miss Blacklog and excitements are bad\nfor her.",
    "Is there anything more you want to know Inspector\n\nI just want to know exactly how many people make up your household\nhere and something about them.",
    "Yes well in addition to myself and Dora Bunner I have two young\ncousins living here at present Patrick and Julia Simmons.",
    "Cousins Not a nephew and niece\n\nNo.",
    "They call me Aunt Letty but actually they are distant cousins.",
    "Their mother was my second cousin.",
    "Have they always made their home with you\n\nOh dear no only for the last two months.",
    "They lived in the South of\nFrance before the war.",
    "Patrick went into the Navy and Julia I believe\nwas in one of the Ministries.",
    "She was at Llandudno.",
    "When the war was\nover their mother wrote and asked me if they could possibly come to\nme as paying guests  Julia is training as a dispenser in Milchester\nGeneral Hospital Patrick is studying for an engineering degree at\nMilchester University.",
    "Milchester as you know is only fifty minutes by\nbus and I was very glad to have them here.",
    "This house is really too\nlarge for me.",
    "They pay a small sum for board and lodging and it all\nworks out very well.",
    "She added with a smile I like having somebody\nyoung about the place.",
    "Then there is a Mrs. Haymes I believe\n\nYes.",
    "She works as an assistant gardener at Dayas Hall Mrs. Lucass\nplace.",
    "The cottage there is occupied by the old gardener and his wife\nand Mrs. Lucas asked if I could billet her here.",
    "Shes a very nice girl.",
    "Her husband was killed in Italy and she has a boy of eight who is at a\nprep school and whom I have arranged to have here in the holidays.",
    "And by way of domestic help\n\nA jobbing gardener comes in on Tuesdays and Fridays.",
    "A Mrs. Huggins\nfrom the village comes up five mornings a week and I have a foreign\nrefugee with a most unpronounceable name as a kind of lady cook help.",
    "You will find Mitzi rather difficult Im afraid.",
    "She has a kind of\npersecution mania.",
    "Craddock nodded.",
    "He was conscious in his own mind of yet another of\nConstable Leggs invaluable commentaries.",
    "Having appended the word\nscatty to Dora Bunner and All right to Letitia Blacklog he had\nembellished Mitzis record with the one word Liar.",
    "As though she had read his mind Miss Blacklog said Please dont be\ntoo prejudiced against the poor thing because shes a liar.",
    "I do really\nbelieve that like so many liars there is a real substratum of truth\nbehind her lies.",
    "I mean that though to take an instance her atrocity\nstories have grown and grown until every kind of unpleasant story that\nhas ever appeared in print has happened to her or her relations\npersonally she did have a bad shock initially and did see one at least\nof her relations killed.",
    "I think a lot of these displaced persons feel\nperhaps justly that their claim to our notice and sympathy lies in their\natrocity value and so they exaggerate and invent.",
    "She added Quite frankly Mitzi is a maddening person.",
    "She\nexasperates and infuriates us all she is suspicious and sulky is\nperpetually having feelings and thinking herself insulted.",
    "But in spite\n\n\fof it all I really am sorry for her.",
    "She smiled.",
    "And also when she\nwants to she can cook very nicely.",
    "Ill try not to ruffle her more than I can help said Craddock soothingly.",
    "Was that Miss Julia Simmons who opened the door to me\n\nYes.",
    "Would you like to see her now Patrick has gone out.",
    "Phillipa\nHaymes you will find working at Dayas Hall.",
    "Thank you Miss Blacklog.",
    "Id like to see Miss Simmons now if I may.",
    "Chapter 6 JULIA MITZI AND PATRICK\n\nJulia when she came into the room and sat down in the chair vacated\nby Letitia Blacklog had an air of composure that Craddock for some\nreason found annoying.",
    "She fixed a limpid gaze on him and waited for\nhis questions.",
    "Miss Blacklog had tactfully left the room.",
    "Please tell me about last night.",
    "Miss Simmons.",
    "Last night murmured Julia with a blank stare.",
    "Oh we all slept like\nlogs.",
    "Reaction I suppose.",
    "I mean last night from six oclock onwards.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Well a lot of tiresome people came \n\n\fThey were\n\nShe gave him another limpid stare.",
    "Dont you know all this already\n\nIm asking the questions Miss Simmons said Craddock pleasantly.",
    "My mistake.",
    "I always find repetitions so dreary.",
    "Apparently you dont...\nWell there was Colonel and Mrs. Easterbrook Miss Hinchliffe and Miss\nMurgatroyd Mrs. Swettenham and Edmund Swettenham and Mrs.\nHarmon the Vicars wife.",
    "They arrived in that order and if you want to\nknow what they said  they all said the same things in turn.",
    "I see youve\ngot your central heating on and What lovely chrysanthemums\n\nCraddock bit his lip.",
    "The mimicry was good.",
    "The exception was Mrs. Harmon.",
    "Shes rather a pet.",
    "She came in with\nher hat falling off and her shoelaces untied and she asked straight out\nwhen the murder was going to happen It embarrassed everybody\nbecause theyd all been pretending theyd dropped in by chance.",
    "Aunt\nLetty said in her dry way that it was due to happen quite soon.",
    "And then\nthat clock chimed and just as it finished the lights went out the door\nwas flung open and a masked figure said Stick em up guys or\nsomething like that.",
    "It was exactly like a bad film.",
    "Really quite ridiculous.",
    "And then he fired two shots at Aunt Letty and suddenly it wasnt\nridiculous any more.",
    "Where was everybody when this happened\n\n\fWhen the lights went out Well just standing about you know.",
    "Mrs.\nHarmon was sitting on the sofa  Hinch thats Miss Hinchliffe had taken\nup a manly stance in front of the fireplace.",
    "You were all in this room or the far room\n\nMostly I think in this room.",
    "Patrick had gone into the other to get the\nsherry.",
    "I think Colonel Easterbrook went after him but I dont really\nknow.",
    "We were  well as I said just standing about.",
    "Where were you yourself\n\nI think I was over by the window.",
    "Aunt Letty went to get the\ncigarettes.",
    "On that table by the archway\n\nYes  and then the lights went out and the bad film started.",
    "The man had a powerful torch.",
    "What did he do with it\n\nWell he shone it on us.",
    "Horribly dazzling.",
    "It just made you blink.",
    "I want you to answer this very carefully Miss Simmons.",
    "Did he hold the\ntorch steady or did he move it about\n\nJulia considered.",
    "Her manner was now definitely less weary.",
    "He moved it she said slowly.",
    "Like a spotlight in a dance hall.",
    "It was\nfull in my eyes and then it went on round the room and then the shots\ncame.",
    "Two shots.",
    "And then\n\nHe whirled round  and Mitzi began to scream like a siren from\nsomewhere and his torch went out and there was another shot.",
    "And\nthen the door closed it does you know slowly with a whining noise quite uncanny and there we were all in the dark not knowing what to\ndo and poor Bunny squealing like a rabbit and Mitzi going all out\nacross the hall.",
    "Would it be your opinion that the man shot himself deliberately or do\nyou think he stumbled and the revolver went off accidentally\n\nI havent the faintest idea.",
    "The whole thing was so stagey.",
    "Actually I\nthought it was still some silly joke  until I saw the blood from Lettys ear.",
    "But even if you were actually going to fire a revolver to make the thing\nmore real youd be careful to fire it well above someones head\nwouldnt you\n\nYou would indeed.",
    "Do you think he could see clearly who he was firing\nat I mean was Miss Blacklog clearly outlined in the light of the torch\n\nIve no idea.",
    "I wasnt looking at her.",
    "I was looking at the man.",
    "What Im getting at is  do you think the man was deliberately aiming at\nher  at her in particular I mean\n\n\fJulia seemed a little startled by the idea.",
    "You mean deliberately picking on Aunt Letty Oh I shouldnt think so...\nAfter all if he wanted to take a pot shot at Aunt Letty there would be\nheaps of more suitable opportunities.",
    "There would be no point in\ncollecting all the friends and neighbours just to make it more difficult.",
    "He could have shot her from behind a hedge in the good old Irish\nfashion any day of the week and probably got away with it.",
    "And that thought Craddock was a very complete reply to Dora\nBunners suggestion of a deliberate attack on Letitia Blacklog.",
    "He said with a sigh Thank you Miss Simmons.",
    "Id better go and see\nMitzi now.",
    "Mind her fingernails warned Julia.",
    "Shes a tartar\n\nII\n\nCraddock with Fletcher in attendance found Mitzi in the kitchen.",
    "She\nwas rolling pastry and looked up suspiciously as he entered.",
    "Her black hair hung over her eyes she looked sullen and the purple\njumper and brilliant green skirt she wore were not becoming to her\npasty complexion.",
    "What do you come in my kitchen for Mr. Policeman You are police\nyes Always always there is persecution  ah I should be used to it by\n\n\fnow.",
    "They say it is different here in England but no it is just the same.",
    "You come to torture me yes to make me say things but I shall say\nnothing.",
    "You will tear off my fingernails and put lighted matches on my\nskin  oh yes and worse than that.",
    "But I will not speak do you hear I\nshall say nothing  nothing at all.",
    "And you will send me away to a\nconcentration camp and I shall not care.",
    "Craddock looked at her thoughtfully selecting what was likely to be the\nbest method of attack.",
    "Finally he sighed and said\n\nO.K.",
    "then get your hat and coat.",
    "What is that you say Mitzi looked startled.",
    "Get your hat and coat and come along.",
    "I havent got my nailpulling\napparatus and the rest of the bag of tricks with me.",
    "We keep all that\ndown at the station.",
    "Got the handcuffs handy Fletcher\n\nSir said Sergeant Fletcher with appreciation.",
    "But I do not want to come screeched Mitzi backing away from him.",
    "Then youll answer civil questions civilly.",
    "If you like you can have a\nsolicitor present.",
    "A lawyer I do not like a lawyer.",
    "I do not want a lawyer.",
    "She put the rolling pin down dusted her hands on a cloth and sat down.",
    "What do you want to know she asked sulkily.",
    "I want your account of what happened here last night.",
    "You know very well what happened.",
    "I want your account of it.",
    "I tried to go away.",
    "Did she tell you that When I saw that in the paper\nsaying about murder.",
    "I wanted to go away.",
    "She would not let me.",
    "She is\nvery hard  not at all sympathetic.",
    "She made me stay.",
    "But I knew  I\nknew what would happen.",
    "I knew I should be murdered.",
    "Well you werent murdered were you\n\nNo admitted Mitzi grudgingly.",
    "Come now tell me what happened.",
    "I was nervous.",
    "Oh I was nervous.",
    "All that evening.",
    "I hear things.",
    "People moving about.",
    "Once I think someone is in the hall moving\nstealthily  but it is only that Mrs. Haymes coming in through the side\ndoor so as not to dirty the front steps she says.",
    "Much she cares.",
    "She\nis a Nazi herself that one with her fair hair and her blue eyes so\nsuperior and looking at me and thinking that I  I am only dirt \n\nNever mind Mrs. Haymes.",
    "Who does she think she is Has she had expensive university\neducation like I have Has she a degree in Economics No she is just a\npaid labourer.",
    "She digs and mows grass and is paid so much every\nSaturday.",
    "Who is she to call herself a lady\n\nNever mind Mrs. Haymes I said.",
    "Go on.",
    "I take the sherry and the glasses and the little pastries that I have\nmade so nice into the drawingroom.",
    "Then the bell rings and I answer\nthe door.",
    "Again and again I answer the door.",
    "It is degrading  but I do it.",
    "And then I go back into the pantry and I start to polish the silver and I\nthink it will be very handy that because if someone comes to kill me I\nhave there close at hand the big carving knife all sharp.",
    "Very foresighted of you.",
    "And then suddenly  I hear shots.",
    "I think It has come  it is\nhappening.",
    "I run through the diningroom the other door  it will not\nopen I stand a moment to listen and then there comes another shot and\na big thud out there in the hall and I turn the door handle but it is\nlocked outside.",
    "I am shut in there like a rat in a trap.",
    "And I go mad with\nfear.",
    "I scream and I scream and I beat upon the door.",
    "And at last  at\nlast  they turn the key and let me out.",
    "And then I bring candles many\nmany candles  and the lights go on and I see blood  blood Ach Gott\nim Himmel the blood It is not the first time I have seen blood.",
    "My little\nbrother  I see him killed before my eyes  I see blood in the street people shot dying  I \n\nYes said Inspector Craddock.",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "And now said Mitzi dramatically you can arrest me and take me to\nprison\n\nNot today said Inspector Craddock.",
    "III\n\nAs Craddock and Fletcher went through the hall to the front door it was\nflung open and a tall handsome young man almost collided with them.",
    "Sleuths as I live cried the young man.",
    "Mr. Patrick Simmons\n\nQuite right Inspector.",
    "Youre the Inspector arent you and the others\nthe Sergeant\n\nYou are quite right Mr. Simmons.",
    "Can I have a word with you please\n\nI am innocent Inspector.",

    "Ive a good many other\npeople to see and I dont want to waste time.",
    "Whats this room Can we\ngo in here\n\nIts the socalled study  but nobody studies.",
    "I was told that you were studying said Craddock.",
    "I found I couldnt concentrate on mathematics so I came home.",
    "In a businesslike manner Inspector Craddock demanded full name age\ndetails of war service.",
    "And now Mr. Simmons will you describe what happened last night\n\nWe killed the fatted calf Inspector.",
    "That is Mitzi set her hand to\nmaking savoury pastries.",
    "Aunt Letty opened a new bottle of sherry \n\nCraddock interrupted.",
    "A new bottle Was there an old one\n\nYes.",
    "Half full.",
    "But Aunt Letty didnt seem to fancy it.",
    "Was she nervous then\n\nOh not really.",
    "Shes extremely sensible.",
    "It was old Bunny I think who\nhad put the wind up her  prophesying disaster all day.",
    "Miss Bunner was definitely apprehensive then\n\nOh yes she enjoyed herself thoroughly.",
    "She took the advertisement seriously\n\nIt scared her into fits.",
    "Miss Blacklog seems to have thought when she first read that\nadvertisement that you had had something to do with it.",
    "Why was\nthat\n\nAh sure I get blamed for everything round here\n\nYou didnt have anything to do with it did you Mr. Simmons\n\nMe Never in the world.",
    "Had you ever seen or spoken to this Rudi Scherz\n\nNever seen him in my life.",
    "It was the kind of joke you might have played though\n\nWhos been telling you that Just because I once made Bunny an\napplepie bed  and sent Mitzi a postcard saying the Gestapo was on\nher track \n\nJust give me your account of what happened.",
    "Id just gone into the small drawingroom to fetch the drinks when Hey\nPresto the lights went out.",
    "I turned round and theres a fellow standing\nin the doorway saying Stick your hands up and everybody gasping\nand squealing and just when Im thinking  can I rush him he starts\nfiring a revolver and then crash down he goes and his torch goes out\nand were in the dark again and Colonel Easterbrook starts shouting\n\n\forders in his barrackroom voice.",
    "Lights he says and will my lighter\ngo on No it wont as is the way of those cussed inventions.",
    "Did it seem to you that the intruder was definitely aiming at Miss\nBlacklog\n\nAh how could I tell I should say he just loosed off his revolver for the\nfun of the thing  and then found maybe hed gone too far.",
    "And shot himself\n\nIt could be.",
    "When I saw the face of him he looked like the kind of little\npasty thief who might easily lose his nerve.",
    "And youre sure you had never seen him before\n\nNever.",
    "Thank you Mr. Simmons.",
    "I shall want to interview the other people\nwho were here last night.",

    "He turned\naway and the old man called after him grudgingly\n\n\fMaybe youd find her in the apple orchard.",
    "Shes younger than I am for\ngetting the apples down.",

    "Quite so Mrs. Haymes.",
    "And what did you do when you came in\n\nKicked off my muddy footwear and went upstairs and had a bath and\nchanged.",

    "Which you proceeded to do\n\n\fWell I didnt actually.",
    "I thought it was just fun and I was tired and I\ndidnt think I needed really to put them up.",

    "It was just\nlike a pig being killed.",
    "Did you find the torch very dazzling\n\nNo not particularly.",
    "It was quite a strong one though.",
    "It lit up Miss\nBunner for a moment and she looked quite like a turnip ghost  you\nknow all white and staring with her mouth open and her eyes starting\nout of her head.",
    "The man moved the torch\n\nOh yes he played it all round the room.",
    "As though he were looking for someone\n\nNot particularly I should say.",
    "And after that Mrs. Haymes\n\nPhillipa Haymes frowned.",
    "Oh it was all a terrible muddle and confusion.",
    "Edmund Swettenham\nand Patrick Simmons switched on their lighters and they went out into\nthe hall and we followed and someone opened the diningroom door the lights hadnt fused there  and Edmund Swettenham gave Mitzi a\nterrific slap on the cheek and brought her out of her screaming fit and\nafter that it wasnt so bad.",
    "You saw the body of the dead man\n\nYes.",
    "Was he known to you Had you ever seen him before\n\nNever.",
    "Have you any opinion as to whether his death was accidental or do\nyou think he shot himself deliberately\n\nI havent the faintest idea.",
    "You didnt see him when he came to the house previously\n\nNo.",
    "I believe it was in the middle of the morning and I shouldnt have\nbeen there.",
    "Im out all day.",
    "Thank you Mrs. Haymes.",
    "One thing more.",
    "You havent any valuable\njewellery Rings bracelets anything of that kind\n\n\fPhillipa shook her head.",
    "My engagement ring  a couple of brooches.",
    "And as far as you know there was nothing of particular value in the\nhouse\n\nNo.",
    "I mean there is some quite nice silver  but nothing out of the\nordinary.",
    "Thank you Mrs. Haymes.",
    "II\n\nAs Craddock retraced his steps through the kitchen garden he came\nface to face with a large redfaced lady carefully corseted.",
    "Good morning she said belligerently.",
    "What do you want here\n\nMrs. Lucas I am DetectiveInspector Craddock.",
    "Oh thats who you are.",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "I dont like strangers forcing\ntheir way into my garden wasting the gardeners time.",
    "But I quite\nunderstand you have to do your duty.",
    "Quite so.",
    "May I ask if we are to expect a repetition of that outrage last night at\nMiss Blacklogs Is it a gang\n\n\fWe are satisfied Mrs. Lucas that it was not the work of a gang.",
    "There are far too many robberies nowadays.",
    "The police are getting\nslack.",
    "Craddock did not reply.",
    "I suppose youve been talking to\nPhillipa Haymes\n\nI wanted her account as an eyewitness.",
    "You couldnt have waited until one oclock I suppose After all it\nwould be fairer to question her in her time rather than in mine...\n\nIm anxious to get back to headquarters.",
    "Not that one expects consideration nowadays.",
    "Or a decent days work.",
    "On duty late half an hours pottering.",
    "A break for elevenses at ten\noclock.",
    "No work done at all the moment the rain starts.",
    "When you want\nthe lawn mown theres always something wrong with the mower.",
    "And\noff duty five or ten minutes before the proper time.",
    "I understood from Mrs. Haymes that she left here at twenty minutes\npast five yesterday instead of five oclock.",
    "Oh I dare say she did.",
    "Give her her due Mrs. Haymes is quite keen on\nher work though there have been days when I have come out here and\nnot been able to find her anywhere.",
    "She is a lady by birth of course\nand one feels its ones duty to do something for these poor young war\nwidows.",
    "Not that it isnt very inconvenient.",
    "Those long school holidays\nand the arrangement is that she has extra time off then.",
    "I told her that\n\n\fthere are really excellent camps nowadays where children can be sent\nand where they have a delightful time and enjoy it far more than\nwandering about with their parents.",
    "They need practically not come\nhome at all in the summer holidays.",
    "But Mrs. Haymes didnt take kindly to that idea\n\nShes as obstinate as a mule that girl.",
    "Just the time of year when I\nwant the tennis court mowed and marked nearly every day.",
    "Old Ashe\ngets the lines crooked.",
    "But my convenience is never considered\n\nI presume Mrs. Haymes takes a smaller salary than is usual.",
    "Naturally.",
    "What else could she expect\n\nNothing Im sure said Craddock.",
    "Good morning Mrs. Lucas.",
    "III\n\nIt was dreadful said Mrs. Swettenham happily.",
    "Quite  quite  dreadful and what I say is that they ought to be far more\ncareful what advertisements they accept at the Gazette office.",
    "At the\ntime when I read it I thought it was very odd.",
    "I said so didnt I\nEdmund\n\nDo you remember just what you were doing when the lights went out\nMrs. Swettenham asked the Inspector.",
    "How that reminds me of my old Nannie Where was Moses when the\nlight went out The answer of course was In the Dark.",
    "Just like us\nyesterday evening.",
    "All standing about and wondering what was going\nto happen.",
    "And then you know the thrill when it suddenly went pitch\nblack.",
    "And the door opening  just a dim figure standing there with a\nrevolver and that blinding light and a menacing voice saying Your\nmoney or your life Oh Ive never enjoyed anything so much.",
    "And then\na minute later of course it was all dreadful.",
    "Real bullets just whistling\npast our cars It must have been just like the Commandos in the war.",
    "Whereabouts were you standing or sitting at the time Mrs.\nSwettenham\n\nNow let me see where was I Who was I talking to Edmund\n\nI really havent the least idea Mother.",
    "Was it Miss Hinchliffe I was asking about giving the hens cod liver oil in\nthe cold weather Or was it Mrs. Harmon  no shed only just arrived.",
    "I\nthink I was just saying to Colonel Easterbrook that I thought it was\nreally very dangerous to have an atom research station in England.",
    "It\nought to be on some lonely island in case the radioactivity gets loose.",
    "You dont remember if you were sitting or standing\n\nDoes it really matter Inspector I was somewhere over by the window\nor near the mantelpiece because I know I was quite near the clock\nwhen it struck.",
    "Such a thrilling moment Waiting to see if anything might\nbe going to happen.",
    "You describe the light from the torch as blinding.",
    "Was it turned full on\nto you\n\nIt was right in my eyes.",
    "I couldnt see a thing.",
    "Did the man hold it still or did he move it about from person to\nperson\n\nOh I dont really know.",
    "Which did he do Edmund\n\nIt moved rather slowly over us all so as to see what we were all doing\nI suppose in case we should try and rush him.",
    "And where exactly in the room were you Mr. Swettenham\n\nId been talking to Julia Simmons.",
    "We were both standing up in the\nmiddle of the room  the long room.",
    "Was everyone in that room or was there anyone in the far room\n\nPhillipa Haymes had moved in there I think.",
    "She was over by that far\nmantelpiece.",
    "I think she was looking for something.",
    "Have you any idea as to whether the third shot was suicide or an\naccident\n\nIve no idea at all.",
    "The man seemed to swerve round very suddenly and\nthen crumple up and fall  but it was all very confused.",
    "You must realise\n\n\fthat you couldnt really see anything.",
    "And then that refugee girl started\nyelling the place down.",
    "I understand it was you who unlocked the diningroom door and let her\nout\n\nYes.",
    "The door was definitely locked on the outside\n\nEdmund looked at him curiously.",
    "Certainly it was.",
    "Why you dont\nimagine \n\nI just like to get my facts quite clear.",
    "Thank you Mr. Swettenham.",
    "IV\n\nInspector Craddock was forced to spend quite a long time with Colonel\nand Mrs. Easterbrook.",
    "He had to listen to a long disquisition on the\npsychological aspect of the case.",
    "The psychological approach  thats the only thing nowadays the\nColonel told him.",
    "Youve got to understand your criminal.",
    "Now the\nwhole setup here is quite plain to a man whos had the wide experience\nthat I have.",
    "Why does this fellow put that advert in Psychology.",
    "He\nwants to advertise himself  to focus attention on himself.",
    "Hes been\npassed over perhaps despised as a foreigner by the other employees\nat the Spa Hotel.",
    "A girl has turned him down perhaps.",
    "He wants to rivet\nher attention on him.",
    "Who is the idol of the cinema nowadays  the\n\n\fgangster  the tough guy Very well he will be a tough guy.",
    "Robbery\nwith violence.",
    "A mask A revolver But he wants an audience  he must\nhave an audience.",
    "So he arranges for an audience.",
    "And then at the\nsupreme moment his part runs away with him  hes more than a\nburglar.",
    "Hes a killer.",
    "He shoots  blindly \n\nInspector Craddock caught gladly at a word You say blindly Colonel\nEasterbrook.",
    "You didnt think that he was firing deliberately at one\nparticular object  at Miss Blacklog that is to say\n\nNo no.",
    "He just loosed off as I say blindly.",
    "And thats what brought him\nto himself.",
    "The bullet hit someone  actually it was only a graze but he\ndidnt know that.",
    "He comes to himself with a bang.",
    "All this  this makebelieve hes been indulging in  is real.",
    "Hes shot at someone  perhaps\nkilled someone... Its all up with him.",
    "And so in blind panic he turns the\nrevolver on himself.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook paused cleared his throat appreciatively and said\nin a satisfied voice Plain as a pikestaff thats what it is plain as a\npikestaff.",
    "It really is wonderful said Mrs. Easterbrook the way you know\nexactly what happened Archie.",
    "Her voice was warm with admiration.",
    "Inspector Craddock thought it was wonderful too but he was not quite\nso warmly appreciative.",
    "Exactly where were you in the room Colonel Easterbrook when the\nactual shooting business took place\n\nI was standing with my wife  near a centre table with some flowers on\nit.",
    "I caught hold of your arm didnt I Archie when it happened I was\nsimply scared to death.",
    "I just had to hold on to you.",
    "Poor little kitten said the Colonel playfully.",
    "V\n\nThe Inspector ran Miss Hinchliffe to earth by a pigsty.",
    "Nice creatures pigs said Miss Hinchliffe scratching a wrinkled pink\nback.",
    "Coming on well isnt he Good bacon round about Christmas\ntime.",
    "Well what do you want to see me about I told your people last\nnight I hadnt the least idea who the man was.",
    "Never seen him\nanywhere in the neighbourhood snooping about or anything of that sort.",
    "Our Mrs. Mopp says he came from one of the big hotels in Medenham\nWells.",
    "Why didnt he hold up someone there if he wanted to Get a\nmuch better haul.",
    "That was undeniable  Craddock proceeded with his inquiries.",
    "Where were you exactly when the incident took place\n\n\fIncident Reminds me of my A.R.P.",
    "days.",
    "Saw some incidents then I\ncan tell you.",
    "Where was I when the shooting started That what you\nwant to know\n\nYes.",
    "Leaning up against the mantelpiece hoping to God someone would\noffer me a drink soon replied Miss Hinchliffe promptly.",
    "Do you think that the shots were fired blindly or aimed carefully at one\nparticular person\n\nYou mean aimed at Letty Blacklog How the devil should I know\nDamned hard to sort out what your impressions really were or what\nreally happened after its all over.",
    "All I know is the lights went out and\nthat torch went whirling round dazzling us all and then the shots were\nfired and I thought to myself If that damned young fool Patrick\nSimmons is playing his jokes with a loaded revolver somebody will get\nhurt.",
    "You thought it was Patrick Simmons\n\nWell it seemed likely.",
    "Edmund Swettenham is intellectual and writes\nbooks and doesnt care for horseplay and old Colonel Easterbrook\nwouldnt think that sort of thing funny.",
    "But Patricks a wild boy.",
    "However I apologise to him for the idea.",
    "Did your friend think it might be Patrick Simmons\n\n\fMurgatroyd Youd better talk to her yourself.",
    "Not that youll get any\nsense out of her.",
    "Shes down the orchard.",
    "Ill yell for her if you like.",
    "Miss Hinchliffe raised her stentorian voice in a powerful bellow\n\nHi  you Murgatroyd...\n\nComing... floated back a thin cry.",
    "Hurry up  Polieece bellowed Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "Miss Murgatroyd arrived at a brisk trot very much out of breath.",
    "Her\nskirt was down at the hem and her hair was escaping from an\ninadequate hair net.",
    "Her round goodnatured face beamed.",
    "Is it Scotland Yard she asked breathlessly.",
    "Id no idea.",
    "Or I wouldnt\nhave left the house.",
    "We havent called in Scotland Yard yet Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "Im Inspector\nCraddock from Milchester.",
    "Well thats very nice Im sure said Miss Murgatroyd vaguely.",
    "Have\nyou found any clues\n\nWhere were you at the time of the crime thats what he wants to know\nMurgatroyd said Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "She winked at Craddock.",
    "Oh dear gasped Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "Of course.",
    "I ought to have been\nprepared.",
    "Alibis of course.",
    "Now let me see I was just with everybody\nelse.",
    "You werent with me said Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "Oh dear Hinch wasnt I No of course Id been admiring the\nchrysanthemums.",
    "Very poor specimens really.",
    "And then it all\nhappened  only I didnt really know it had happened  I mean I didnt\nknow that anything like that had happened.",
    "I didnt imagine for a\nmoment that it was a real revolver  and all so awkward in the dark and\nthat dreadful screaming.",
    "I got it all wrong you know.",
    "I thought she was\nbeing murdered  I mean the refugee girl.",
    "I thought she was having her\nthroat cut across the hall somewhere.",
    "I didnt know it was him  I mean\nI didnt even know there was a man.",
    "It was really just a voice you know\nsaying Put them up please.",
    "Stick em up Miss Hinchliffe corrected.",
    "And no suggestion of\nplease about it.",
    "Its so terrible to think that until that girl started screaming I was\nactually enjoying myself.",
    "Only being in the dark was very awkward and I\ngot a knock on my corn.",
    "Agony it was.",
    "Is there anything more you want\nto know Inspector\n\nNo said Inspector Craddock eyeing Miss Murgatroyd speculatively.",
    "I dont really think there is.",
    "Her friend gave a short bark of laughter.",
    "Hes got you taped Murgatroyd.",
    "Im sure Hinch said Miss Murgatroyd that Im only too willing to say\nanything I can.",
    "He doesnt want that said Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "She looked at the Inspector.",
    "If youre doing this geographically I\nsuppose youll go to the Vicarage next.",
    "You might get something there.",
    "Mrs. Harmon looks as vague as they make them  but I sometimes think\nshes got brains.",
    "Anyway shes got something.",
    "As they watched the Inspector and Sergeant Fletcher stalk away Amy\nMurgatroyd said breathlessly\n\nOh Hinch was I very awful I do get so flustered\n\nNot at all.",
    "Miss Hinchliffe smiled.",
    "On the whole I should say you did\nvery well.",
    "VI\n\nInspector Craddock looked round the big shabby room with a sense of\npleasure.",
    "It reminded him a little of his own Cumberland home.",
    "Faded\nchintz big shabby chairs flowers and books strewn about and a\nspaniel in a basket.",
    "Mrs. Harmon too with her distraught air and her\ngeneral disarray and her eager face he found sympathetic.",
    "But she said at once frankly I shant be any help to you.",
    "Because I\nshut my eyes.",
    "I hate being dazzled.",
    "And then there were shots and I\nscrewed them up tighter than ever.",
    "And I did wish oh I did wish that it\nhad been a quiet murder.",
    "I dont like bangs.",
    "So you didnt see anything.",
    "The Inspector smiled at her.",
    "But you\nheard\n\nOh my goodness yes there was plenty to hear.",
    "Doors opening and\nshutting and people saying silly things and gasping and old Mitzi\nscreaming like a steam engine  and poor Bunny squealing like a\ntrapped rabbit.",
    "And everyone pushing and falling over everyone else.",
    "However when there really didnt seem to be any more bangs coming I\nopened my eyes.",
    "Everyone was out in the hall then with candles.",
    "And\nthen the lights came on and suddenly it was all as usual  I dont mean\nreally as usual but we were ourselves again not just  people in the\ndark.",
    "People in the dark are quite different arent they\n\nI think I know what you mean Mrs. Harmon.",
    "Mrs. Harmon smiled at him.",
    "And there he was she said.",
    "A rather weasellylooking foreigner  all\npink and surprised looking  lying there dead  with a revolver beside\nhim.",
    "It didnt  oh it didnt seem to make sense somehow.",
    "It did not make sense to the Inspector either...",
    "The whole business\nworried him.",
    "Chapter 8 ENTER MISS MARPLE\n\nCraddock laid the typed transcript of the various interviews before the\nChief Constable.",
    "The latter had just finished reading the wire received\nfrom the Swiss Police.",
    "So he had a police record all right said Rydesdale.",
    "Hm  very much\nas one thought.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Jewellery... hm yes... falsified entries... yes... cheque... Definitely a\ndishonest fellow.",
    "Yes sir  in a small way.",
    "Quite so.",
    "And small things lead to large things.",
    "I wonder sir.",
    "The Chief Constable looked up.",
    "Worried Craddock\n\nYes sir.",
    "Why Its a straightforward story.",
    "Or isnt it Lets see what all these\npeople youve been talking to have to say.",
    "He drew the report towards him and read it through rapidly.",
    "The usual thing  plenty of inconsistencies and contradictions.",
    "Different peoples accounts of a few moments of stress never agree.",
    "But the main picture seems clear enough.",
    "I know sir  but its an unsatisfactory picture.",
    "If you know what I mean its the wrong picture.",
    "Well lets take the facts.",
    "Rudi Scherz took the 520 bus from\nMedenham to Chipping Cleghorn arriving there at six oclock.",
    "Evidence\nof conductor and two passengers.",
    "From the bus stop he walked away in\nthe direction of Little Paddocks.",
    "He got into the house with no\nparticular difficulty  probably through the front door.",
    "He held up the\ncompany with a revolver he fired two shots one of which slightly\nwounded Miss Blacklog he then killed himself with a third shot\nwhether accidentally or deliberately there is not sufficient evidence to\nshow.",
    "The reasons why he did all this are profoundly unsatisfactory I\nagree.",
    "But why isnt really a question we are called upon to answer.",
    "A\nCoroners jury may bring it in suicide  or accidental death.",
    "Whichever\nverdict it is its the same as far as were concerned.",
    "We can write\nfinis.",
    "You mean we can always fall back upon Colonel Easterbrooks\npsychology said Craddock gloomily.",
    "Rydesdale smiled.",
    "After all the Colonels probably had a good deal of experience he\nsaid.",
    "Im pretty sick of the psychological jargon thats used so glibly\nabout everything nowadays  but we cant really rule it out.",
    "I still feel the pictures all wrong sir.",
    "Any reason to believe that somebody in the setup at Chipping\nCleghorn is lying to you\n\nCraddock hesitated.",
    "I think the foreign girl knows more than she lets on.",
    "But that may be\njust prejudice on my part.",
    "You think she might possibly have been in it with this fellow Let him\ninto the house Put him up to it\n\nSomething of the kind.",
    "I wouldnt put it past her.",
    "But that surely\nindicates that there really was something valuable money or jewellery\nin the house and that doesnt seem to have been the case.",
    "Miss\nBlacklog negatived it quite decidedly.",
    "So did the others.",
    "That leaves us\nwith the proposition that there was something valuable in the house\nthat nobody knew about \n\nQuite a best seller plot.",
    "I agree its ridiculous sir.",
    "The only other point is Miss Bunners\ncertainty that it was a definite attempt by Scherz to murder Miss\nBlacklog.",
    "Well from what you say  and from her statement this Miss Bunner \n\nOh I agree sir Craddock put in quickly shes an utterly unreliable\nwitness.",
    "Highly suggestible.",
    "Anyone could put a thing into her head but the interesting thing is that this is quite her own theory  no one has\nsuggested it to her.",
    "Everybody else negatives it.",
    "For once shes not\nswimming with the tide.",
    "It definitely is her own impression.",
    "And why should Rudi Scherz want to kill Miss Blacklog\n\nThere you are sir.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Miss Blacklog doesnt know  unless\nshes a much better liar than I think she is.",
    "Nobody knows.",
    "So\npresumably it isnt true.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Cheer up Craddock said the Chief Constable.",
    "Im taking you off to\nlunch with Sir Henry and myself.",
    "The best that the Royal Spa Hotel in\nMedenham Wells can provide.",
    "Thank you sir.",
    "Craddock looked slightly surprised.",
    "You see we received a letter  He broke off as Sir Henry Clithering\nentered the room.",
    "Ah there you are Henry.",
    "Sir Henry informal this time said Morning Dermot.",
    "Ive got something for you.",
    "Henry said the Chief Constable.",
    "Whats that\n\nAuthentic letter from an old Pussy.",
    "Staying at the Royal Spa Hotel.",
    "Something she thinks we might like to know in connection with this\nChipping Cleghorn business.",
    "The old Pussies said Sir Henry triumphantly.",
    "What did I tell you They hear everything.",
    "They see everything.",
    "And\nunlike the famous adage they speak all evil.",
    "Whats this particular one\ngot hold of\n\nRydesdale consulted the letter.",
    "Writes just like my old grandmother he complained.",
    "Spiky.",
    "Like a\nspider in the ink bottle and all underlined.",
    "A good deal about how she\nhopes it wont be taking up our valuable time but might possibly be of\nsome slight assistance etc.",
    "etc.",
    "Whats her name Jane  something Murple  no Marple Jane Marple.",
    "Ye Gods and Little Fishes said Sir Henry can it be George its my\nown particular one and only four starred Pussy.",
    "The super Pussy of all\nold Pussies.",
    "And she has managed somehow to be at Medenham Wells\ninstead of peacefully at home in St. Mary Mead just at the right time to\nbe mixed up in a murder.",
    "Once more a murder is announced  for the\nbenefit and enjoyment of Miss Marple.",
    "Well Henry said Rydesdale sardonically.",
    "Ill be glad to see your\nparagon.",
    "Come on Well lunch at the Royal Spa and well interview the\nlady.",
    "Craddock here is looking highly sceptical.",
    "Not at all sir said Craddock politely.",
    "He thought to himself that sometimes his godfather carried things a bit\nfar.",
    "II\n\nMiss Jane Marple was very nearly if not quite as Craddock had\npictured her.",
    "She was far more benignant than he had imagined and a\ngood deal older.",
    "She seemed indeed very old.",
    "She had snow white hair\nand a pink crinkled face and very soft innocent blue eyes and she was\nheavily enmeshed in fleecy wool.",
    "Wool round her shoulders in the form\nof a lacy cape and wool that she was knitting and which turned out to\nbe a babys shawl.",
    "She was all incoherent delight and pleasure at seeing Sir Henry and\nbecame quite flustered when introduced to the Chief Constable and\nDetectiveInspector Craddock.",
    "But really Sir Henry how fortunate... how very fortunate.",
    "So long\nsince I have seen you...",
    "Yes my rheumatism.",
    "Very bad of late.",
    "Of\ncourse I couldnt have afforded this hotel really fantastic what they\ncharge nowadays but Raymond  my nephew Raymond West you may\nremember him\n\n\fEveryone knows his name.",
    "Yes the dear boy has been so successful with his clever books  he\nprides himself upon never writing about anything pleasant.",
    "The dear\nboy insisted on paying all my expenses.",
    "And his dear wife is making a\nname for herself too as an artist.",
    "Mostly jugs of dying flowers and\nbroken combs on windowsills.",
    "I never dare tell her but I still admire\nBlair Leighton and Alma Tadema.",
    "Oh but Im chattering.",
    "And the Chief\nConstable himself  indeed I never expected  so afraid I shall be taking\nup his time \n\nCompletely\n\ngaga\n\nthought\n\nthe\n\ndisgusted\n\nDetectiveInspector\n\nCraddock.",
    "Come into the Managers private room said Rydesdale.",
    "We can talk\nbetter there.",
    "When Miss Marple had been disentangled from her wool and her spare\nknitting pins collected she accompanied them fluttering and\nprotesting to Mr. Rowlandsons comfortable sittingroom.",
    "Now Miss Marple lets hear what you have to tell us said the Chief\nConstable.",
    "Miss Marple came to the point with unexpected brevity.",
    "It was a cheque she said.",
    "He altered it.",
    "He\n\n\fThe young man at the desk here the one who is supposed to have\nstaged that holdup and shot himself.",
    "He altered a cheque you say\n\nMiss Marple nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "I have it here.",
    "She extracted it from her bag and laid it on the\ntable.",
    "It came this morning with my others from the Bank.",
    "You can see\nit was for seven pounds and he altered it to seventeen.",
    "A stroke in front\nof the 7 and teen added after the word seven with a nice artistic little\nblot just blurring the whole word.",
    "Really very nicely done.",
    "A certain\namount of practice I should say.",
    "Its the same ink because I wrote the\ncheque actually at the desk.",
    "I should think hed done it quite often\nbefore wouldnt you\n\nHe picked the wrong person this time remarked Sir Henry.",
    "Miss Marple nodded agreement.",
    "Yes.",
    "Im afraid he would never have gone very far in crime.",
    "I was quite\nthe wrong person.",
    "Some busy young married woman or some girl\nhaving a love affair  thats the kind who write cheques for all sorts of\ndifferent sums and dont really look through their passbooks carefully.",
    "But an old woman who has to be careful of the pennies and who has\nformed habits  thats quite the wrong person to choose.",
    "Seventeen\npounds is a sum I never write a cheque for.",
    "Twenty pounds a round\nsum for the monthly wages and books.",
    "And as for my personal\n\n\fexpenditure I usually cash seven  it used to be five but everything has\ngone up so.",
    "And perhaps he reminded you of someone prompted Sir Henry\nmischief in his eye.",
    "Miss Marple smiled and shook her head at him.",
    "You are very naughty Sir Henry.",
    "As a matter of fact he did.",
    "Fred Tyier\nat the fish shop.",
    "Always slipped an extra 1 in the shillings column.",
    "Eating so much fish as we do nowadays it made a long bill and lots of\npeople never added it up.",
    "Just ten shillings in his pocket every time not\nmuch but enough to get himself a few neckties and take Jessie Spragge\nthe girl in the drapers to the pictures.",
    "Cut a splash thats what these\nyoung fellows want to do.",
    "Well the very first week I was here there was\na mistake in my bill.",
    "I pointed it out to the young man and he apologised\nvery nicely and looked very much upset but I thought to myself then\nYouve got a shifty eye young man.",
    "What I mean by a shifty eye continued Miss Marple is the kind that\nlooks very straight at you and never looks away or blinks.",
    "Craddock gave a sudden movement of appreciation.",
    "He thought to himself Jim Kelly to the life remembering a notorious\nswindler he had helped to put behind bars not long ago.",
    "Rudi Scherz was a thoroughly unsatisfactory character said\nRydesdale.",
    "Hes got a police record in Switzerland we find.",
    "Made the place too hot for him I suppose and came over here with\nforged papers said Miss Marple.",
    "Exactly said Rydesdale.",
    "He was going about with the little redhaired waitress from the diningroom said Miss Marple.",
    "Fortunately I dont think her hearts affected\nat all.",
    "She just liked to have someone a bit different and he used to\ngive her flowers and chocolates which the English boys dont do much.",
    "Has she told you all she knows she asked turning suddenly to\nCraddock.",
    "Or not quite all yet\n\nIm not absolutely sure said Craddock cautiously.",
    "I think theres a little to come said Miss Marple.",
    "Shes looking very\nworried.",
    "Brought me kippers instead of herrings this morning and\nforgot the milk jug.",
    "Usually shes an excellent waitress.",
    "Yes shes\nworried.",
    "Afraid she might have to give evidence or something like that.",
    "But I expect  her candid blue eyes swept over the manly proportions\nand handsome face of DetectiveInspector Craddock with truly\nfeminine Victorian appreciation  that you will be able to persuade her\nto tell you all she knows.",
    "DetectiveInspector Craddock blushed and Sir Henry chuckled.",
    "It might be important said Miss Marple.",
    "He may have told her who it\nwas.",
    "Rydesdale stared at her.",
    "Who what was\n\nI express myself so badly.",
    "Who it was who put him up to it I mean.",
    "So you think someone put him up to it\n\nMiss Marples eyes widened in surprise.",
    "Oh but surely  I mean... Heres a personable young man  who niches\na little bit here and a little bit there  alters a small cheque perhaps\nhelps himself to a small piece of jewellery if its left lying around or\ntakes a little money from the till  all sorts of small petty thefts.",
    "Keeps\nhimself going in ready money so that he can dress well and take a girl\nabout  all that sort of thing.",
    "And then suddenly he goes off with a\nrevolver and holds up a room full of people and shoots at someone.",
    "Hed never have done a thing like that  not for a moment He wasnt that\nkind of person.",
    "It doesnt make sense.",
    "Craddock drew in his breath sharply.",
    "That was what Letitia Blacklog\nhad said.",
    "What the Vicars wife had said.",
    "What he himself felt with\nincreasing force.",
    "It didnt make sense.",
    "And now Sir Henrys old Pussy\nwas saying it too with complete certainty in her fluting old ladys voice.",
    "Perhaps youll tell us Miss Marple he said and his voice was\nsuddenly aggressive what did happen then\n\nShe turned on him in surprise.",
    "But how should I know what happened There was an account in the\npaper  but it says so little.",
    "One can make conjectures of course but\none has no accurate information.",
    "George said Sir Henry.",
    "Would it be very unorthodox if Miss Marple\nwere allowed to read the notes of the interviews Craddock had with\nthese people at Chipping Cleghorn.",
    "It may be unorthodox said Rydesdale but Ive not got where I am by\nbeing orthodox.",
    "She can read them.",
    "Id be curious to hear what she has\nto say.",
    "Miss Marple was all embarrassment.",
    "Im afraid youve been listening to Sir Henry.",
    "Sir Henry is always too\nkind.",
    "He thinks too much of any little observations I may have made in\nthe past.",
    "Really I have no gifts  no gifts at all  except perhaps a certain\nknowledge of human nature.",
    "People I find are apt to be far too trustful.",
    "Im afraid that I have a tendency always to believe the worst.",
    "Not a nice\ntrait.",
    "But so often justified by subsequent events.",
    "Read these said Rydesdale thrusting the typewritten sheets upon\nher.",
    "They wont take you long.",
    "After all these people are your kind you must know a lot of people like them.",
    "You may be able to spot\nsomething that we havent.",
    "The case is just going to be closed.",
    "Lets\nhave an amateurs opinion on it before we shut up the files.",
    "I dont mind\ntelling you that Craddock here isnt satisfied.",
    "He says like you that it\ndoesnt make sense.",
    "There was silence whilst Miss Marple read.",
    "She put the typewritten\nsheets down at last.",
    "Its very interesting she said with a sigh.",
    "All the different things that\npeople say  and think.",
    "The things they see  or think that they see.",
    "And\nall so complex nearly all so trivial and if one thing isnt trivial its so\nhard to spot which one  like a needle in a haystack.",
    "Craddock felt a twinge of disappointment.",
    "Just for a moment or two he\nhad wondered if Sir Henry might be right about this funny old lady.",
    "She\nmight have put her finger on something  old people were often very\nsharp.",
    "Hed never for instance been able to conceal anything from his\nown great aunt Emma.",
    "She had finally told him that his nose twitched\nwhen he was about to tell a lie.",
    "But just a few fluffy generalities that was all that Sir Henrys famous\nMiss Marple could produce.",
    "He felt annoyed with her and said rather\ncurtly\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the facts are indisputable.",
    "Whatever\nconflicting details these people give they all saw one thing.",
    "They saw a\nmasked man with a revolver and a torch open the door and hold them\nup and whether they think he said Stick em up or Your money or your\nlife or whatever phrase is associated with a holdup in their minds\nthey saw him.",
    "But surely said Miss Marple gently.",
    "They couldnt  actually  have\nseen anything at all...\n\n\fCraddock caught his breath.",
    "Shed got it She was sharp after all.",
    "He\nwas testing her by that speech of his but she hadnt fallen for it.",
    "It didnt\nactually make any difference to the facts or to what happened but\nshed realised as hed realised that those people who had seen a\nmasked man holding them up couldnt really have seen him at all.",
    "If I understand rightly Miss Marple had a pink flush on her cheeks\nher eyes were bright and pleased as a childs there wasnt any light in\nthe hall outside  and not on the landing upstairs either\n\nThats right said Craddock.",
    "And so if a man stood in the doorway and flashed a powerful torch\ninto the room nobody could see anything but the torch could they\n\nNo they couldnt.",
    "I tried it out.",
    "And so when some of them say they saw a masked man etc.",
    "they are\nreally though they dont realise it recapitulating from what they saw\nafterwards  when the lights came on.",
    "So it really all fits in very well\ndoesnt it on the assumption that Rudi Scherz was the  I think fall guy\nis the expression I mean\n\nRydesdale stared at her in such surprise that she grew pinker still.",
    "I may have got the term wrong she murmured.",
    "I am not very clever\nabout Americanisms  and I understand they change very quickly.",
    "I got\nit from one of Mr. Dashiel Hammetts stories.",
    "I understand from my\n\n\fnephew Raymond that he is considered at the top of the tree in what is\ncalled the tough style of literature.",
    "A fall guy if I understand it rightly\nmeans someone who will be blamed for a crime really committed by\nsomeone else.",
    "This Rudi Scherz seems to me exactly the right type for\nthat.",
    "Rather stupid really you know but full of cupidity and probably\nextremely credulous.",
    "Rydesdale said smiling tolerantly Are you suggesting that he was\npersuaded by someone to go out and take pot shots at a room full of\npeople Rather a tall order.",
    "I think he was told that it was a joke said Miss Marple.",
    "He was paid\nfor doing it of course.",
    "Paid that is to put an advertisement in the\nnewspaper to go out and spy out the household premises and then on\nthe night in question he was to go there assume a mask and a black\ncloak and throw open a door brandishing a torch and cry Hands up\n\nAnd fire off a revolver\n\nNo no said Miss Marple.",
    "He never had a revolver.",
    "But everyone says  began Rydesdale and stopped.",
    "Exactly said Miss Marple.",
    "Nobody could possibly have seen a\nrevolver even if he had one.",
    "And I dont think he had.",
    "I think that after\nhed called Hands up somebody came up quietly behind him in the\ndarkness and fired those two shots over his shoulder.",
    "It frightened him\nto death.",
    "He swung round and as he did so that other person shot him\nand then let the revolver drop beside him...",
    "The three men looked at her.",
    "Sir Henry said softly\n\nIts a possible theory.",
    "But who is Mr. X. who came up in the darkness asked the Chief\nConstable.",
    "Miss Marple coughed.",
    "Youll have to find out from Miss Blacklog who wanted to kill her.",
    "Good for old Dora Bunner thought Craddock.",
    "Instinct against\nintelligence every time.",
    "So you think it was a deliberate attempt on Miss Blacklogs life asked\nRydesdale.",
    "It certainly has that appearance said Miss Marple.",
    "Though there are\none or two difficulties.",
    "But what I was really wondering about was\nwhether there mightnt be a short cut.",
    "Ive no doubt that whoever\narranged this with Rudi Scherz took pains to tell him to keep his mouth\nshut about it and perhaps he did keep his mouth shut but if he talked\nto anybody it would probably be to that girl Myrna Harris.",
    "And he may he just may  have dropped some hint as to the kind of person whod\nsuggested the whole thing.",
    "Ill see her now said Craddock rising.",
    "Miss Marple nodded.",
    "Yes do Inspector Craddock.",
    "Ill feel happier when you have.",
    "Because\nonce shes told you anything she knows shell be much safer.",
    "Safer...",
    "Yes I see.",
    "He left the room.",
    "The Chief Constable said doubtfully but tactfully\nWell Miss Marple youve certainly given us something to think about.",
    "III\n\nIm sorry about it I am really said Myrna Harris.",
    "Its ever so nice of\nyou not to be ratty about it.",
    "But you see Mums the sort of person who\nfusses like anything.",
    "And it did look as though Id  whats the phrase been an accessory before the factthe words ran glibly off her tongue.",
    "I mean I was afraid youd never take my word for it that I only thought\nit was just a bit of fun.",
    "Inspector Craddock repeated the reassuring phrases with which he\nhad broken down Myrnas resistance.",
    "I will.",
    "Ill tell you all about it.",
    "But you will keep me out of it if you can\nbecause of Mum It all started with Rudi breaking a date with me.",
    "We\nwere going to the pictures that evening and then he said he wouldnt be\nable to come and I was a bit standoffish with him about it  because\nafter all it had been his idea and I dont fancy being stood up by a\nforeigner.",
    "And he said it wasnt his fault and I said that was a likely\nstory and then he said hed got a bit of a lark on that night  and that he\n\n\fwasnt going to be out of pocket by it and how would I fancy a wristwatch So I said what do you mean by a lark And he said not to tell\nanyone but there was to be a party somewhere and he was to stage a\nsham holdup.",
    "Then he showed me the advertisement hed put in and I\nhad to laugh.",
    "He was a bit scornful about it all.",
    "Said it was kids stuff\nreally  but that was just like the English.",
    "They never really grew up and of course I said what did he mean by talking like that about us and we had a bit of an argument but we made it up.",
    "Only you can\nunderstand cant you sir that when I read all about it and it hadnt\nbeen a joke at all and Rudi had shot someone and then shot himself why I didnt know what to do.",
    "I thought if I said I knew about it\nbeforehand it would look as though I were in on the whole thing.",
    "But it\nreally did seem like a joke when he told me about it.",
    "Id have sworn he\nmeant it that way.",
    "I didnt even know hed got a revolver.",
    "He never said\nanything about taking a revolver with him.",
    "Craddock comforted her and then asked the most important question.",
    "Who did he say it was who had arranged this party\n\nBut there he drew a blank.",
    "He never said who it was that was getting him to do it.",
    "I suppose\nnobody was really.",
    "It was all his own doing.",
    "He didnt mention a name Did he say he  or she\n\nHe didnt say anything except that it was going to be a scream.",
    "I shall\nlaugh to see all their faces.",
    "Thats what he said.",
    "He hadnt had long to laugh Craddock thought.",
    "IV\n\nIts only a theory said Rydesdale as they drove back to Medenham.",
    "Nothing to support it nothing at all.",
    "Put it down as old maids\nvapourings and let it go eh\n\nId rather not do that sir.",
    "Its all very improbable.",
    "A mysterious X appearing suddenly in the\ndarkness behind our Swiss friend.",
    "Where did he come from Who was\nhe Where had he been\n\nHe could have come in through the side door said Craddock just as\nScherz came.",
    "Or he added slowly he could have come from the\nkitchen.",
    "She could have come from the kitchen you mean\n\nYes sir its a possibility.",
    "Ive not been satisfied about that girl all along.",
    "She strikes me as a nasty bit of goods.",
    "All that screaming and hysterics\n it could have been put on.",
    "She could have worked on this young fellow\nlet him in at the right moment rigged the whole thing shot him bolted\nback into the diningroom caught up her bit of silver and her chamois\nand started her screaming act.",
    "Against that we have the fact that  er  whats his name  oh yes\nEdmund Swettenham definitely says the key was turned on the outside\nof the door and that he turned it to release her.",
    "Any other door into that\npart of the house\n\nYes theres a door to the back stairs and kitchen just under the stairs\nbut it seems the handle came off three weeks ago and nobodys come\nto put it on yet.",
    "In the meantime you cant open the door.",
    "Im bound to\nsay that story seems correct.",
    "The spindle and the two handles were on\na shelf outside the door in the hall and they were thickly coated with\ndust but of course a professional would have ways of opening that\ndoor all right.",
    "Better look up the girls record.",
    "See if her papers are in order.",
    "But it\nseems to me the whole thing is very theoretical.",
    "Again the Chief Constable looked inquiringly at his subordinate.",
    "Craddock replied quietly\n\nI know sir and of course if you think the case ought to be closed it\nmust be.",
    "But Id appreciate it if I could work on it for just a little longer.",
    "Rather to his surprise the Chief Constable said quietly and approvingly\n\nGood lad.",
    "Theres the revolver to work on.",
    "If this theory is correct it wasnt\nScherzs revolver and certainly nobody so far has been able to say that\nScherz ever had a revolver.",
    "Its a German make.",
    "I know sir.",
    "But this countrys absolutely full of continental makes of\nguns.",
    "All the Americans brought them back and so did our chaps.",
    "You\ncant go by that.",
    "True enough.",
    "Any other lines of inquiry\n\nTheres got to be a motive.",
    "If theres anything in this theory at all it\nmeans that last Fridays business wasnt a mere joke and wasnt an\nordinary holdup it was a coldblooded attempt at murder.",
    "Somebody\ntried to murder Miss Blacklog.",
    "Now why It seems to me that if anyone\nknows the answer to that it must be Miss Blacklog herself.",
    "I understand she rather poured cold water on that idea\n\nShe poured cold water on the idea that Rudi Scherz wanted to murder\nher.",
    "And she was quite right.",
    "And theres another thing sir.",
    "Yes\n\nSomebody might try again.",
    "That would certainly prove the truth of the theory said the Chief\nConstable dryly.",
    "By the way look after Miss Marple wont you\n\nMiss Marple Why\n\n\fI gather she is taking up residence at the Vicarage in Chipping\nCleghorn and coming into Medenham Wells twice a week for her\ntreatments.",
    "It seems that Mrs. Whatshername is the daughter of an\nold friend of Miss Marples.",
    "Good sporting instincts that old bean.",
    "Oh\nwell I suppose she hasnt much excitement in her life and sniffing round\nafter possible murderers gives her a kick.",
    "I wish she wasnt coming said Craddock seriously.",
    "Going to get under your feet\n\nNot that sir but shes a nice old thing.",
    "I shouldnt like anything to\nhappen to her... always supposing I mean that theres anything in this\ntheory.",
    "Chapter 9 CONCERNING THE DOOR\n\nIm sorry to bother you again Miss Blacklog \n\nOh it doesnt matter.",
    "I suppose as the inquest was adjourned for a\nweek youre hoping to get more evidence\n\nDetectiveInspector Craddock nodded.",
    "To begin with Miss Blacklog Rudi Scherz was not the son of the\nproprietor of the Hotel des Alpes at Montreux.",
    "He seems to have started\nhis career as an orderly in a hospital at Berne.",
    "A good many of the\npatients missed small pieces of jewellery.",
    "Under another name he was\na waiter at one of the small winter sports places.",
    "His speciality there\n\n\fwas making out duplicate bills in the restaurant with items on one that\ndidnt appear on the other.",
    "The difference of course went into his\npocket.",
    "After that he was in a department store in Zurich.",
    "Their losses\nfrom shoplifting were rather above the average whilst he was with\nthem.",
    "It seems likely that the shoplifting wasnt entirely due to\ncustomers.",
    "He was a picker up of unconsidered trifles in fact said Miss\nBlacklog dryly.",
    "Then I was right in thinking that I had not seen him\nbefore\n\nYou were quite right  no doubt you were pointed out to him at the\nRoyal Spa Hotel and he pretended to recognise you.",
    "The Swiss police\nhad begun to make his own country rather too hot for him and he came\nover here with a very nice set of forged papers and took a job at the\nRoyal Spa.",
    "Quite a good hunting ground said Miss Blacklog dryly.",
    "Its extremely\nexpensive and very welloff people stay there.",
    "Some of them are\ncareless about their bills I expect.",
    "Yes said Craddock.",
    "There were prospects of a satisfactory\nharvest.",
    "Miss Blacklog was frowning.",
    "I see all that she said.",
    "But why come to Chipping Cleghorn What\ndoes he think weve got here that could possibly be better than the rich\nRoyal Spa Hotel\n\n\fYou stick to your statement that theres nothing of especial value in the\nhouse\n\nOf course there isnt.",
    "I should know.",
    "I can assure you Inspector weve\nnot got an unrecognised Rembrandt or anything like that.",
    "Then it looks doesnt it as though your friend Miss Bunner were\nright He came here to attack you.",
    "There Letty what did I tell you\n\nOh nonsense Bunny.",
    "But is it nonsense said Craddock.",
    "I think you know that its true.",
    "Miss Blacklog stared very hard at him.",
    "Now lets get this straight.",
    "You really believe that this young man\ncame out here  having previously arranged by means of an\nadvertisement that half the village would turn up agog at that particular\ntime \n\nBut he maynt have meant that to happen interrupted Miss Bunner\neagerly.",
    "It may have been just a horrid sort of warning  to you Letty thats how I read it at the time  A murder is announced  I felt in my\nbones that it was sinister  if it had all gone as planned he would have\nshot you and got away  and how would anyone have ever known who it\nwas\n\n\fThats true enough said Miss Blacklog.",
    "But \n\nI knew that advertisement wasnt a joke Letty.",
    "I said so.",
    "And look at\nMitzi  she was frightened too\n\nAh said Craddock Mitzi.",
    "Id like to know rather more about that\nyoung woman.",
    "Her permit and papers are quite in order.",
    "I dont doubt that said Craddock dryly.",
    "Scherzs papers appeared to\nbe quite correct too.",
    "But why should this Rudi Scherz want to murder me Thats what you\ndont attempt to explain Inspector Craddock.",
    "There may have been someone behind Scherz said Craddock slowly.",
    "Have you thought of that\n\nHe used the words metaphorically though it flashed across his mind\nthat if Miss Marples theory was correct the words would also be true in\na literal sense.",
    "In any case they made little impression on Miss Blacklog\nwho still looked sceptical.",
    "The point remains the same she said.",
    "Why on earth should anyone\nwant to murder me\n\nIts the answer to that that I want you to give me Miss Blacklog.",
    "Well I cant Thats flat.",
    "Ive no enemies.",
    "As far as Im aware Ive\nalways lived on perfectly good terms with my neighbours.",
    "I dont know\nany guilty secrets about anyone.",
    "The whole idea is ridiculous And if\nwhat youre hinting is that Mitzi has something to do with this thats\nabsurd too.",
    "As Miss Bunner has just told you she was frightened to\ndeath when she saw that advertisement in the Gazette.",
    "She actually\nwanted to pack up and leave the house then and there.",
    "That may have been a clever move on her part.",
    "She may have known\nyoud press her to stay.",
    "Of course if youve made up your mind about it youll find an answer\nto everything.",
    "But I can assure you that if Mitzi had taken an\nunreasoning dislike to me she might conceivably poison my food but\nIm sure she wouldnt go in for all this elaborate rigmarole.",
    "The whole ideas absurd.",
    "I believe you police have got an antiforeigner complex.",
    "Mitzi may be a liar but shes not a coldblooded\nmurderer.",
    "Go and bully her if you must.",
    "But when shes departed in a\nwhirl of indignation or shut herself up howling in her room Ive a good\nmind to make you cook the dinner.",
    "Mrs. Harmon is bringing some old\nlady who is staying with her to tea this afternoon and I wanted Mitzi to\nmake some little cakes  but I suppose youll upset her completely.",
    "Cant you possibly go and suspect somebody else\n\nII\n\n\fCraddock went out to the kitchen.",
    "He asked Mitzi questions that he had\nasked her before and received the same answers.",
    "Yes she had locked the front door soon after four oclock.",
    "No she did\nnot always do so but that afternoon she had been nervous because of\nthat dreadful advertisement.",
    "It was no good locking the side door because Miss Blacklog and Miss\nBunner went out that way to shut up the ducks and feed the chickens\nand Mrs. Haymes usually came in that way from work.",
    "Mrs. Haymes says she locked the door when she came in at 530.",
    "Ah and you believe her  oh yes you believe her...\n\nDo you think we shouldnt believe her\n\nWhat does it matter what I think You will not believe me.",
    "Supposing you give us a chance.",
    "You think Mrs. Haymes didnt lock\nthat door\n\nI thinking she was very careful not to lock it.",
    "What do you mean by that asked Craddock.",
    "That young man he does not work alone.",
    "No he knows where to come\nhe knows that when he comes a door will be left open for him  oh very\nconveniently open\n\n\fWhat are you trying to say\n\nWhat is the use of what I say You will not listen.",
    "You say I am a poor\nrefugee girl who tells lies.",
    "You say that a fairhaired English lady oh no\nshe does not tell lies  she is so British  so honest.",
    "So you believe her\nand not me.",
    "But I could tell you.",
    "Oh yes I could tell you\n\nShe banged down a saucepan on the stove.",
    "Craddock was in two minds whether to take notice of what might be\nonly a stream of spite.",
    "We note everything we are told he said.",
    "I shall not tell you anything at all.",
    "Why should I You are all alike.",
    "You\npersecute and despise poor refugees.",
    "If I say to you that when a week\nbefore that young man come to ask Miss Blacklog for money and she\nsends him away as  you say with a flea in the ear  if I tell you that after\nthat I hear him talking with Mrs. Haymes  yes out there in the\nsummerhouse  all you say is that I make it up\n\nAnd so you probably are making it up thought Craddock.",
    "But he said aloud\n\nYou couldnt hear what was said out in the summerhouse.",
    "There you are wrong screamed Mitzi triumphantly.",
    "I go out to get nettles  it makes very nice vegetables nettles.",
    "They do\nnot think so but I cook it and not tell them.",
    "And I hear them talking in\nthere.",
    "He say to her But where can I hide And she say I will show you\n and then she say At a quarterpast six and I think Ach so That is\nhow you behave my fine lady After you come back from work you go\nout to meet a man.",
    "You bring him into the house.",
    "Miss Blacklog I think\nshe will not like that.",
    "She will turn you out.",
    "I will watch I think and listen\nand then I will tell Miss Blacklog.",
    "But I understand now I was wrong.",
    "It\nwas not love she planned with him it was to rob and to murder.",
    "But you\nwill say I make all this up.",
    "Wicked Mitzi you will say.",
    "I will take her to\nprison.",
    "Craddock wondered.",
    "She might be making it up.",
    "But possibly she might not.",
    "He asked cautiously\n\nYou are sure it was this Rudi Scherz she was talking to\n\nOf course I am sure.",
    "He just leave and I see him go from the drive\nacross to the summerhouse.",
    "And presently said Mitzi defiantly I go\nout to see if there are any nice young green nettles.",
    "Would there the Inspector wondered be any nice young green nettles\nin October But he appreciated that Mitzi had had to produce a hurried\nreason for what had undoubtedly been nothing more than plain\nsnooping.",
    "You didnt hear any more than what you have told me\n\n\fMitzi looked aggrieved.",
    "That Miss Bunner the one with the long nose she call and call me.",
    "Mitzi Mitzi So I have to go.",
    "Oh she is irritating.",
    "Always interfering.",
    "Says she will teach me to cook.",
    "Her cooking It tastes yes everything\nshe does of water water water\n\nWhy didnt you tell me this the other day asked Craddock sternly.",
    "Because I did not remember  I did not think... Only afterwards do I say\nto myself it was planned then  planned with her.",
    "You are quite sure it was Mrs. Haymes\n\nOh yes I am sure.",
    "Oh yes I am very sure.",
    "She is a thief that Mrs.\nHaymes.",
    "A thief and the associate of thieves.",
    "What she gets for working\nin the garden it is not enough for such a fine lady no.",
    "She has to rob\nMiss Blacklog who has been kind to her.",
    "Oh she is bad bad bad that\none\n\nSupposing said the Inspector watching her closely that someone\nwas to say that you had been seen talking to Rudi Scherz\n\nThe suggestion had less effect than he had hoped for.",
    "Mitzi merely snorted and tossed her head.",
    "If anyone say they see me talking to him that is lies lies lies lies she\nsaid contemptuously.",
    "To tell lies about anyone that is easy but in\nEngland you have to prove them true.",
    "Miss Blacklog tell me that and it\nis true is it not I do not speak with murderers and thieves.",
    "And no\nEnglish policeman shall say I do.",
    "And how can I do cooking for lunch if\nyou are here talk talk talk Go out of my kitchens please.",
    "I want now\nto make a very careful sauce.",
    "Craddock went obediently.",
    "He was a little shaken in his suspicions of\nMitzi.",
    "Her story about Phillipa Haymes had been told with great\nconviction.",
    "Mitzi might be a liar he thought she was but he fancied\nthat there might be some substratum of truth in this particular tale.",
    "He\nresolved to speak to Phillipa on the subject.",
    "She had seemed to him\nwhen he questioned her a quiet wellbred young woman.",
    "He had had\nno suspicion of her.",
    "Crossing the hall in his abstraction he tried to open the wrong door.",
    "Miss Bunner descending the staircase hastily put him right.",
    "Not that door she said.",
    "It doesnt open.",
    "The next one to the left.",
    "Very\nconfusing isnt it.",
    "So many doors.",
    "There are a good many said Craddock looking up and down the\nnarrow hall.",
    "Miss Bunner amiably enumerated them for him.",
    "First the door to the cloakroom and then the cloaks cupboard door\nand then the diningroom thats on that side.",
    "And on this side the\n\n\fdummy door that you were trying to get through and then theres the\ndrawingroom door proper and then the china cupboard door and the\ndoor of the little flower room and at the end the side door.",
    "Most\nconfusing.",
    "Especially these two being so near together.",
    "Ive often tried\nthe wrong one by mistake.",
    "We used to have the hall table against it as a\nmatter of fact but then we moved it along against the wall there.",
    "Craddock had noted almost mechanically a thin line horizontally\nacross the panels of the door he had been trying to open.",
    "He realised\nnow it was the mark where the table had been.",
    "Something stirred\nvaguely in his mind as he asked Moved How long ago\n\nIn questioning Dora Bunner there was fortunately no need to give a\nreason for any question.",
    "Any query on any subject seemed perfectly\nnatural to the garrulous Miss Bunner who delighted in the giving of\ninformation however trivial.",
    "Now let me see really quite recently  ten days or a fortnight ago.",
    "Why was it moved\n\nI really cant remember.",
    "Something to do with the flowers.",
    "I think\nPhillipa did a big vase  she arranges flowers quite beautifully  all\nautumn colouring and twigs and branches and it was so big it caught\nyour hair as you went past and so Phillipa said Why not move the table\nalong and anyway the flowers would look much better against the bare\nwall than against the panels of the door.",
    "Only we had to take down\nWellington at Waterloo.",
    "Not a print Im really very fond of.",
    "We put it\n\n\funder the stairs.",
    "Its not really a dummy then Craddock asked looking at the door.",
    "Oh no its a real door if thats what you mean.",
    "Its the door of the\nsmall drawingroom but when the rooms were thrown into one one\ndidnt need two doors so this one was fastened up.",
    "Fastened up Craddock tried it again gently.",
    "You mean its nailed\nup Or just locked\n\nOh locked I think and bolted too.",
    "He saw the bolt at the top and tried it.",
    "The bolt slid back easily  too\neasily...",
    "When was it last open he asked Miss Bunner.",
    "Oh years and years ago I imagine.",
    "Its never been opened since Ive\nbeen here I know that.",
    "You dont know where the key is\n\nThere are a lot of keys in the hall drawer.",
    "Its probably among those.",
    "Craddock followed her and looked at a rusty assortment of old keys\npushed far back in the drawer.",
    "He scanned them and selected one that\nlooked different from the rest and went back to the door.",
    "The key fitted\nand turned easily.",
    "He pushed and the door slid open noiselessly.",
    "Oh do be careful cried Miss Bunner.",
    "There may be something\nresting against it inside.",
    "We never open it.",
    "Dont you said the Inspector.",
    "His face now was grim.",
    "He said with emphasis This doors been\nopened quite recently Miss Bunner.",
    "The locks been oiled and the\nhinges.",
    "She stared at him her foolish face a gape.",
    "But who could have done that she asked.",
    "Thats what I mean to find out said Craddock grimly.",
    "He thought  X\nfrom outside No  X was here  in this house  X was in the drawingroom that night...\n\nChapter 10 PIP AND EMMA\n\nMiss Blacklog listened to him this time with more attention.",
    "She was an\nintelligent woman as he had known and she grasped the implications\nof what he had to tell her.",
    "Yes she said quietly.",
    "That does alter things... No one had any right\nto meddle with that door.",
    "Nobody has meddled with it to my\nknowledge.",
    "You see what it means the Inspector urged.",
    "When the lights went\nout anybody in this room the other night could have slipped out of that\ndoor come up behind Rudi Scherz and fired at you.",
    "Without being seen or heard or noticed\n\nWithout being seen or heard or noticed.",
    "Remember when the lights\nwent out people moved exclaimed bumped into each other.",
    "And after\nthat all that could be seen was the blinding light of the electric torch.",
    "Miss Blacklog said slowly And you believe that one of those people one of my nice commonplace neighbours  slipped out and tried to\nmurder me Me But why For goodness sake why\n\nIve a feeling that you must know the answer to that question Miss\nBlacklog.",
    "But I dont Inspector.",
    "I can assure you I dont.",
    "Well lets make a start.",
    "Who gets your money if you were to die\n\nMiss Blacklog said rather reluctantly\n\nPatrick and Julia.",
    "Ive left the furniture in this house and a small\nannuity to Bunny.",
    "Really Ive not much to leave.",
    "I had holdings in\nGerman and Italian securities which became worthless and what with\ntaxation and the lower percentages that are now paid on invested\ncapital I can assure you Im not worth murdering  I put most of my\nmoney into an annuity about a year ago.",
    "Still you have some income Miss Blacklog and your nephew and\nniece would come into it.",
    "And so Patrick and Julia would plan to murder me I simply dont\nbelieve it.",
    "Theyre not desperately hard up or anything like that.",
    "Do you know that for a fact\n\nNo.",
    "I suppose I only know it from what theyve told me...",
    "But I really\nrefuse to suspect them.",
    "Someday I might be worth murdering but not\nnow.",
    "What do you mean by someday you might be worth murdering Miss\nBlacklog Inspector Craddock pounced on the statement.",
    "Simply that one day  possibly quite soon  I may be a very rich\nwoman.",
    "That sounds interesting.",
    "Will you explain\n\nCertainly.",
    "You may not know it but for more than twenty years I was\nsecretary to and closely associated with Randall Goedler.",
    "Craddock was interested.",
    "Randall Goedler had been a big name in the\nworld of finance.",
    "His daring speculations and the rather theatrical\npublicity with which he surrounded himself had made him a personality\nnot quickly forgotten.",
    "He had died if Craddock remembered rightly in\n1937 or 1938.",
    "Hes rather before your time I expect said Miss Blacklog.",
    "But youve\nprobably heard of him.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "He was a millionaire wasnt he\n\nOh several times over  though his finances fluctuated.",
    "He always\nrisked most of what he made on some new coup.",
    "She spoke with a certain animation her eyes brightened by memory.",
    "Anyway he died a very rich man.",
    "He had no children.",
    "He left his fortune\nin trust for his wife during her lifetime and after her death to me\nabsolutely.",
    "A vague memory stirred in the Inspectors mind.",
    "Immense Fortune to come to Faithful Secretary  something of that\nkind.",
    "For the last twelve years or so said Miss Blacklog with a slight\ntwinkle Ive had an excellent motive for murdering Mrs. Goedler  but\nthat doesnt help you does it\n\nDid  excuse me for asking this  did Mrs. Goedler resent her husbands\ndisposition of his fortune Miss Blacklog was now looking frankly\namused.",
    "You neednt be so very discreet.",
    "What you really mean is was I Randall\nGoedlers mistress No I wasnt.",
    "I dont think Randall ever gave me a\n\n\fsentimental thought and I certainly didnt give him one.",
    "He was in love\nwith Belle his wife and remained in love with her until he died.",
    "I think\nin all probability it was gratitude on his part that prompted his making\nhis will.",
    "You see Inspector in the very early days when Randall was\nstill on an insecure footing he came very near to disaster.",
    "It was a\nquestion of just a few thousands of actual cash.",
    "It was a big coup and a\nvery exciting one daring as all his schemes were but he just hadnt\ngot that little bit of cash to tide him over.",
    "I came to the rescue.",
    "I had a\nlittle money of my own.",
    "I believed in Randall.",
    "I sold every penny I had\nout and gave it to him.",
    "It did the trick.",
    "A week later he was an\nimmensely wealthy man.",
    "After that he treated me more or less as a junior partner.",
    "Oh they\nwere exciting days.",
    "She sighed.",
    "I enjoyed it all thoroughly.",
    "Then my\nfather died and my only sister was left a hopeless invalid.",
    "I had to give\nit all up and go and look after her.",
    "Randall died a couple of years later.",
    "I\nhad made quite a lot of money during our association and I didnt really\nexpect him to leave me anything but I was very touched yes and very\nproud to find that if Belle predeceased me and she was one of those\ndelicate creatures whom everyone always says wont live long I was to\ninherit his entire fortune.",
    "I think really the poor man didnt know who to\nleave it to.",
    "Belles a dear and she was delighted about it.",
    "Shes really a\nvery sweet person.",
    "She lives up in Scotland.",
    "I havent seen her for years\n we just write at Christmas.",
    "You see I went with my sister to a\nsanatorium in Switzerland just before the war.",
    "She died of consumption\nout there.",
    "She was silent for a moment or two then said\n\n\fI only came back to England just over a year ago.",
    "You said you might  be a rich woman very soon... How soon\n\nI heard from the nurse attendant who looks after Belle Goedler that\nBelle is sinking rapidly.",
    "It may be  only a few weeks.",
    "She added sadly\n\nThe money wont mean much to me now.",
    "Ive got quite enough for my\nrather simple needs.",
    "Once I should have enjoyed playing the markets\nagain  but now... Oh well one grows old.",
    "Still you do see Inspector\ndont you that if Patrick and Julia wanted to kill me for a financial\nreason theyd be crazy not to wait for another few weeks.",
    "Yes Miss Blacklog but what happens if you should predecease Mrs.\nGoedler.",
    "Who does the money go to then\n\nDyou know Ive never really thought.",
    "Pip and Emma I suppose...\n\nCraddock stared and Miss Blacklog smiled.",
    "Does that sound rather crazy I believe if I predecease Belle the\nmoney would go to the legal offspring  or whatever the term is  of\nRandalls only sister.",
    "Sonia Randall had quarrelled with his sister.",
    "She\nmarried a man whom he considered a crook and worse.",
    "And was he a crook\n\n\fOh definitely I should say.",
    "But I believe a very attractive person to\nwomen.",
    "He was a Greek or a Roumanian or something  what was his\nname now  Stamfordis Dmitri Stamfordis.",
    "Randall Goedler cut his sister out of his will when she married this\nman\n\nOh Sonia was a very wealthy woman in her own right.",
    "Randall had\nalready settled packets of money on her as far as possible in a way so\nthat her husband couldnt touch it.",
    "But I believe that when the lawyers\nurged him to put in someone in case I predeceased Belle he reluctantly\nput down Sonias offspring simply because he couldnt think of anyone\nelse and he wasnt the sort of man to leave money to charities.",
    "And there were children of the marriage\n\nWell there are Pip and Emma.",
    "She laughed.",
    "I know it sounds\nridiculous.",
    "All I know is that Sonia wrote once to Belle after her\nmarriage telling her to tell Randall that she was extremely happy and\nthat she had just had twins and was calling them Pip and Emma.",
    "As far\nas I know she never wrote again.",
    "But Belle of course may be able to\ntell you more.",
    "Miss Blacklog had been amused by her own recital.",
    "The Inspector did not look amused.",
    "It comes to this he said.",
    "If you had been killed the other night there\nare presumably at least two people in the world who would have come\n\n\finto a very large fortune.",
    "You are wrong Miss Blacklog when you say\nthat there is no one who has a motive for desiring your death.",
    "There are\ntwo people at least who are vitally interested.",
    "How old would this\nbrother and sister be\n\nMiss Blacklog frowned.",
    "Let me see... 1922... no  its difficult to remember....",
    "I suppose about\ntwentyfive or twentysix.",
    "Her face had sobered.",
    "But you surely dont think \n\nI think somebody shot at you with the intent to kill you.",
    "I think it\npossible that that same person or persons might try again.",
    "I would like\nyou if you will to be very very careful Miss Blacklog.",
    "One murder has\nbeen arranged and did not come off.",
    "I think it possible that another\nmurder may be arranged very soon.",
    "II\n\nPhillipa Haymes straightened her back and pushed back a tendril of\nhair from her damp forehead.",
    "She was cleaning a flower border.",
    "Yes Inspector\n\nShe looked at him inquiringly.",
    "In return he gave her a rather closer\nscrutiny than he had done before.",
    "Yes a goodlooking girl a very\nEnglish type with her pale ashblonde hair and her rather long face.",
    "An\nobstinate chin and mouth.",
    "Something of repression  of tautness about\n\n\fher.",
    "The eyes were blue very steady in their glance and told you\nnothing at all.",
    "The sort of girl he thought who would keep a secret well.",
    "Im sorry always to bother you when youre at work Mrs. Haymes he\nsaid but I didnt want to wait until you came back for lunch.",
    "Besides I\nthought it might be easier to talk to you here away from Little\nPaddocks.",
    "Yes Inspector\n\nNo emotion and little interest in the voice.",
    "But was there a note of\nwariness  or did he imagine it\n\nA certain statement has been made to me this morning.",
    "This statement\nconcerns you.",
    "Phillipa raised her eyebrows very slightly.",
    "You told me Mrs. Haymes that this man Rudi Scherz was quite\nunknown to you\n\nYes.",
    "That when you saw him there dead it was the first time you had set\neyes on him.",
    "Is that so\n\nCertainly.",
    "I had never seen him before.",
    "You did not for instance have a conversation with him in the\nsummerhouse of Little Paddocks\n\nIn the summerhouse\n\nHe was almost sure he caught a note of fear in her voice.",
    "Yes Mrs. Haymes.",
    "Who says so\n\nI am told that you had a conversation with this man Rudi Scherz and\nthat he asked you where he could hide and you replied that you would\nshow him and that a time a quarterpast six was definitely mentioned.",
    "It would be a quarterpast six roughly when Scherz would get here\nfrom the bus stop on the evening of the holdup.",
    "There was a moments silence.",
    "Then Phillipa gave a short scornful\nlaugh.",
    "She looked amused.",
    "I dont know who told you that she said.",
    "At least I can guess.",
    "Its a\nvery silly clumsy story  spiteful of course.",
    "For some reason Mitzi\ndislikes me even more than she dislikes the rest of us.",
    "You deny it\n\nOf course its not true...",
    "I never met or saw Rudi Scherz in my life and I\nwas nowhere near the house that morning.",
    "I was over here working.",
    "Inspector Craddock said very gently\n\nWhich morning\n\nThere was a momentary pause.",
    "Her eyelids flickered.",
    "Every morning.",
    "Im here every morning.",
    "I dont get away until one\noclock.",
    "She added scornfully\n\nIts no good listening to what Mitzi tells you.",
    "She tells lies all the time.",
    "And thats that said Craddock when he was walking away with\nSergeant Fletcher.",
    "Two young women whose stories flatly contradict\neach other.",
    "Which one am I to believe\n\nEveryone seems to agree that this foreign girl tells whoppers said\nFletcher.",
    "Its been my experience in dealing with aliens that lying\ncomes more easy than truth telling.",
    "Seems to be clear shes got a spite\nagainst this Mrs. Haymes.",
    "So if you were me youd believe Mrs. Haymes\n\nUnless youve got reason to think otherwise sir.",
    "And Craddock hadnt\nnot really  only the remembrance of a pair of oversteady blue eyes and\nthe glib enunciation of the words that morning.",
    "For to the best of his\nrecollection he hadnt said whether the interview in the summerhouse\nhad taken place in the morning or the afternoon.",
    "Still Miss Blacklog or if not Miss Blacklog certainly Miss Bunner might\nhave mentioned the visit of the young foreigner who had come to cadge\nhis fare back to Switzerland.",
    "And Phillipa Haymes might have therefore\nassumed that the conversation was supposed to have taken place on\nthat particular morning.",
    "But Craddock still thought that there had been a note of fear in her\nvoice as she asked In the summerhouse\n\nHe decided to keep an open mind on the subject.",
    "III\n\nIt was very pleasant in the Vicarage garden.",
    "One of those sudden spells\nof autumn warmth had descended upon England.",
    "Inspector Craddock\ncould never remember if it was St. Martins or St. Lukes Summer but\nhe knew that it was very pleasant  and also very enervating.",
    "He sat in a deck chair provided for him by an energetic Bunch just on\nher way to a Mothers Meeting and well protected with shawls and a\nlarge rug round her knees Miss Marple sat knitting beside him.",
    "The\nsunshine the peace the steady click of Miss Marples knitting needles\nall combined to produce a soporific feeling in the Inspector.",
    "And yet at\nthe same time there was a nightmarish feeling at the back of his mind.",
    "It was like a familiar dream where an undertone of menace grows and\nfinally turns Ease into Terror...",
    "He said abruptly You oughtnt to be here.",
    "Miss Marples needles stopped clicking for a moment.",
    "Her placid china\nblue eyes regarded him thoughtfully.",
    "She said I know what you mean.",
    "Youre a very conscientious boy.",
    "But\nits perfectly all right.",
    "Bunchs father he was vicar of our parish a very\nfine scholar and her mother who is a most remarkable woman  real\nspiritual power are very old friends of mine.",
    "Its the most natural thing\nin the world that when Im at Medenham I should come on here to stay\nwith Bunch for a little.",
    "Oh perhaps said Craddock.",
    "But  but dont snoop around... Ive a\nfeeling  I have really  that it isnt safe.",
    "Miss Marple smiled a little.",
    "But Im afraid she said that we old women always do snoop.",
    "It\nwould be very odd and much more noticeable if I didnt.",
    "Questions\nabout mutual friends in different parts of the world and whether they\nremember so and so and do they remember who it was that Lady\nSomebodys daughter married All that helps doesnt it\n\nHelps said the Inspector rather stupidly.",
    "Helps to find out if people are who they say they are said Miss Marple.",
    "She went on Because thats whats worrying you isnt it And thats\nreally the particular way the world has changed since the war.",
    "Take\n\n\fthis place Chipping Cleghorn for instance.",
    "Its very much like St. Mary\nMead where I live.",
    "Fifteen years ago one knew who everybody was.",
    "The\nBantrys in the big house  and the Hartnells and the Price Ridleys and\nthe Weatherbys...",
    "They were people whose fathers and mothers and\ngrandfathers and grandmothers or whose aunts and uncles had lived\nthere before them.",
    "If somebody new came to live there they brought\nletters of introduction or theyd been in the same regiment or served\non the same ship as someone there already.",
    "If anybody new  really new\n really a stranger  came well they stuck out  everybody wondered\nabout them and didnt rest till they found out.",
    "She nodded her head gently\n\nBut its not like that any more.",
    "Every village and small country place is\nfull of people whove just come and settled there without any ties to\nbring them.",
    "The big houses have been sold and the cottages have been\nconverted and changed.",
    "And people just come  and all you know about\nthem is what they say of themselves.",
    "Theyve come you see from all\nover the world.",
    "People from India and Hong Kong and China and\npeople who lived in France and Italy in cheap places and quaint islands.",
    "And also those who made some money and could retire.",
    "But no one\nknows any longer whos who.",
    "Somebody can own Benares Bronze\nobjects and speak of tiffin and chota Hazri  or own statues from\nTaormina and speak of their english church there  as Miss Murgatroyd\nand Miss Hinchcliffe.",
    "He may come from the Orient or the South of\nFrance.",
    "And everybody accepts the newcomers without hesitation.",
    "They dont expect for the first visit to first receive a letter from a friend\nsaying that soandso is a charming person a childhood friend etc...\n\n\fAnd that thought Craddock was exactly the source of his trouble.",
    "He\ndidnt know.",
    "They were all just faces and personalities vouched for by\nrationing and I.D.",
    "cards... well  printed but without photographies or\nfingerprints.",
    "You could get an I.D.",
    "for the asking  and partly due to this\nthe subtle ties that hold the structure of the rural society together were\nloosening.",
    "In a city nobody knows their neighbours neither in the\ncountry but sometimes you have the illusion that you do.",
    "Thanks to the tampered door Craddock knew that one of the\noccupants of the livingroom of Little Paddocks wasnt the good\nneighbour he or she pretended to be...\n\nAnd so he was afraid of what could happen to Miss Marple who was so\nfrail and old even if she was so clever...\n\nUp to a point he said we can check the past lives of these people...",
    "But he knew that this what harder than it seemed.",
    "India China HongKong South of France... much harder than it would have been fifteen\nyears ago.",
    "He knew well that many people went around with borrowed\nidentities... mostly borrowed from people who died in tragic\ncircumstances in the big cities.",
    "There were organizations who bought\nor faked I.D.",
    "cards  there were hundreds of kinds of small illegal\nactivities around.",
    "It was possible to check  but it would take a lot of\ntime time he didnt have since the widow of Randall Goedler was dying\nsoon.",
    "It was then tired and worried bathed in sunlight that he told Miss\nMarple the story of Randall Goedler and Pip and Emma.",
    "Two names nothing more he said.",
    "Nicknames after all They may\nnot exist.",
    "They may be respectable citizens living somewhere in Europe.",
    "Or one of them or both could be here in Chipping Cleghorn.",
    "About twentyfive years old... who could they be He went on\n\nThe nephew and niece... or cousins or whatever... for how long didnt\nshe see them I would like to know...\n\nIll try to find out said Miss Marple quietly.",
    "For Gods sake dont Miss Marple...\n\nIts going to be easy Inspector dont you worry.",
    "And nobody will pay\nattention since it wont be official.",
    "If theres something wrong its better\nnot to alarm them isnt it\n\nPip and Emma thought Craddock.",
    "Pip and Emma It had become an\nobsession to him.",
    "The goodlooking smart boy the beautiful girl with\ncold eyes...",
    "I may discover something about them in the next fortyeight hours he\nsaid.",
    "Im going to Scotland.",
    "If she is able to talk Mrs. Goedler may tell\nme something about Pip and Emma.",
    "Chapter 11 MISS MARPLE COMES TO TEA\n\nIf Letitia Blacklog seemed slightly absentminded when Mrs. Harmon\ncame to tea and brought a guest who was staying with her Miss Marple\n\n\fthe guest in question was hardly likely to notice the fact since it was\nthe first time she had met her.",
    "The old lady was very charming in her gentle gossipy fashion.",
    "She\nrevealed herself almost at once to be one of those old ladies who have a\nconstant preoccupation with burglars.",
    "They can get in anywhere my dear she assured her hostess\nabsolutely anywhere nowadays.",
    "So many new American methods.",
    "I\nmyself pin my faith to a very oldfashioned device.",
    "A cabin hook and eye.",
    "They can pick locks and draw back bolts but a brass hook and eye\ndefeats them.",
    "Have you ever tried that\n\nIm afraid were not very good at bolts and bars said Miss Blacklog\ncheerfully.",
    "Theres really nothing much to burgle.",
    "A chain on the front door Miss Marple advised.",
    "Then the maid need\nonly open it a crack and see who is there and they cant force their way\nin.",
    "I expect Mitzi our Mittel European would love that.",
    "The holdup you had must have been very very frightening said Miss\nMarple.",
    "Bunch has been telling me all about it.",
    "I was scared stiff said Bunch.",
    "It was an alarming experience admitted Miss Blacklog.",
    "It really seems like Providence that the man tripped himself up and\nshot himself.",
    "These burglars are so violent nowadays.",
    "How did he get\nin\n\nWell Im afraid we dont lock our doors much.",
    "Oh Letty exclaimed Miss Bunner.",
    "I forgot to tell you the Inspector\nwas most peculiar this morning.",
    "He insisted on opening the second\ndoor  you know  the one thats never been opened  the one over there.",
    "He hunted for the key and everything and said the door had been oiled.",
    "But I cant see why because \n\nToo late she got Miss Blacklogs signal to be quiet and paused openmouthed.",
    "Oh Lotty Im so sorry  I mean oh I do beg your pardon Letty  oh\ndear how stupid I am.",
    "It doesnt matter said Miss Blacklog but she was annoyed.",
    "Only I\ndont think Inspector Craddock wants that talked about.",
    "I didnt know\nyou had been there when he was experimenting Dora.",
    "You do\nunderstand dont you Mrs. Harmon\n\nOh yes said Bunch.",
    "We wont breathe a word will we Aunt Jane.",
    "But I wonder why he \n\nShe relapsed into thought.",
    "Miss Bunner fidgeted and looked miserable\nbursting out at last I always say the wrong thing  Oh dear Im\nnothing but a trial to you Letty.",
    "Miss Blacklog said quickly Youre my great comfort Dora.",
    "And\nanyway in a small place like Chipping Cleghorn there arent really any\nsecrets.",
    "Now that is very true said Miss Marple.",
    "Im afraid you know that\nthings do get round in the most extraordinary way.",
    "Servants of course\nand yet it cant only be that because one has so few servants\nnowadays.",
    "Still there are the daily women and perhaps they are worse\nbecause they go to everybody in turn and pass the news round.",
    "Oh said Bunch Harmon suddenly.",
    "Ive got it Of course if that door\ncould open too someone might have gone out of here in the dark and\ndone the holdup  only of course they didnt  because it was the man\nfrom the Royal Spa Hotel.",
    "Or wasnt it... No I dont see after all... she\nfrowned.",
    "Did it all happen in this room then asked Miss Marple adding\napologetically Im afraid you must think me sadly curious Miss\nBlacklog  but it really is so very exciting  just like something one reads\nabout in the paper  and actually to have happened to someone one\nknows... Im just longing to hear all about it and to picture it all if you\nknow what I mean \n\nImmediately Miss Marple received a confused and voluble account from\nBunch and Miss Bunner  with occasional emendations and corrections\nfrom Miss Blacklog.",
    "In the middle of it Patrick came in and goodnaturedly entered into the\nspirit of the recital  going so far as to enact himself the part of Rudi\nScherzo.",
    "And Aunt Letty was there  in the corner by the archway... Go and\nstand there Aunt Letty.",
    "Miss Blacklog obeyed and then Miss Marple was shown the actual\nbullet holes.",
    "What a marvellous  what a providential escape she gasped.",
    "I was just going to offer my guests cigarettes  Miss Blacklog\nindicated the big silver box on the table.",
    "People are so careless when they smoke said Miss Bunner\ndisapprovingly.",
    "Nobody really respects good furniture as they used to\ndo.",
    "Look at the horrid burn somebody made on this beautiful table by\nputting a cigarette down on it.",
    "Disgraceful.",
    "Miss Blacklog sighed.",
    "Sometimes Im afraid one thinks too much of ones possessions.",
    "But its such a lovely table Letty.",
    "Miss Bunner loved her friends possessions with as much fervour as\nthough they had been her own.",
    "Bunch Harmon had always thought it\nwas a very endearing trait in her.",
    "She showed no sign of envy.",
    "It is a lovely table said Miss Marple politely.",
    "And what a very pretty\nchina lamp on it.",
    "Again it was Miss Bunner who accepted the compliment as though she\nand not Miss Blacklog was the owner of the lamp.",
    "Isnt it delightful Dresden.",
    "There is a pair of them.",
    "The others in the\nspare room I think.",
    "You know where everything in this house is Dora  or you think you\ndo said Miss Blacklog goodhumouredly.",
    "You care far more about my things than I do.",
    "Miss Bunner flushed.",
    "I do like nice things she said.",
    "Her voice was half defiant  half wistful.",
    "I must confess said Miss Marple that my own few possessions are\nvery dear to me too  so many memories you know.",
    "Its the same with\nphotographs.",
    "People nowadays have so few photographs about.",
    "Now I\nlike to keep all the pictures of my nephews and nieces as babies  and\nthen as children  and so on.",
    "Youve got a horrible one of me aged three said Bunch.",
    "Holding a\nfox terrier and squinting.",
    "I expect your aunt has many photographs of you said Miss Marple\nturning to Patrick.",
    "Oh were only distant cousins said Patrick.",
    "I believe Elinor did send me one of you as a baby Pat said Miss\nBlacklog.",
    "But Im afraid I didnt keep it.",
    "Id really forgotten how many\nchildren shed had or what their names were until she wrote me about\nyou two being over here.",
    "Another sign of the times said Miss Marple.",
    "Nowadays one so often doesnt know ones younger relations at all.",
    "In\nthe old days with all the big family reunions that would have been\nimpossible.",
    "I last saw Pat and Julias mother at a wedding thirty years ago said\nMiss Blacklog.",
    "She was a very pretty girl.",
    "Thats why she has such handsome children said Patrick with a grin.",
    "Youve got a marvellous old album said Julia.",
    "Do you remember\nAunt Letty we looked through it the other day.",
    "The hats\n\nAnd how smart we thought ourselves said Miss Blacklog with a sigh.",
    "Never mind Aunt Letty said Patrick Julia will come across a\nsnapshot of herself in about thirty years time  and wont she think she\nlooks a guy\n\n\fDid you do that on purpose said Bunch as she and Miss Marple were\nwalking home.",
    "Talk about photographs I mean\n\nWell my dear it is interesting to know that Miss Blacklog didnt know\neither of her two young relatives by sight...",
    "Yes  I think Inspector\nCraddock will be interested to hear that.",

    "Phillipa Haymes was\nat work.",

    "Making a rapid survey of the household bedrooms he found an\nirritating normality.",

    "Mrs. Swettenham gave a faint scream.",
    "Oh how you startled me.",
    "I thought it might be another burglar.",
    "Fletcher came down the stairs.",
    "This house doesnt seem very well protected against burglars he\nsaid.",
    "Can anybody always walk in and out just as they like\n\nI just brought up some of my quinces explained Mrs. Swettenham.",

    "Not counting the ayah.",

    "So much\nworse for the miners always getting psittiscosis or is that parrot\ndisease and having to come out of the mines and try to be gardeners\nthough they dont know weeds from spinach.",
    "She added as she tripped towards the door I mustnt keep you.",
    "I\nexpect youre very busy.",
    "Nothing else is going to happen is it\n\nWhy should it Mrs. Swettenham\n\nI just wondered seeing you here.",
    "I thought it might be a gang.",
    "Youll\ntell Miss Blacklog about the quinces wont you\n\nMrs. Swettenham departed.",
    "Fletcher felt like a man who has received\nan unexpected jolt.",
    "He had been assuming  erroneously he now\nperceived  that it must have been someone in the house who had done\nthe oiling of the door.",
    "He saw now that he was wrong.",
    "An outsider had\nonly to wait until Mitzi had departed by bus and Letitia Blacklog and\nDora Bunner were both out of the house.",

    "Fishy\n\nYes.",
    "Tuck your hair up Murgatroyd and take this trowel.",
    "Pretend its a\nrevolver.",
    "Oh said Miss Murgatroyd nervously.",
    "All right.",
    "It wont bite you.",
    "Now come along to the kitchen door.",
    "Youre\ngoing to be the burglar.",
    "You stand here.",
    "Now youre going into the\nkitchen to hold up a lot of nitwits.",
    "Take the torch.",
    "Switch it on.",
    "But its broad daylight\n\nUse your imagination Murgatroyd.",
    "Switch it on.",
    "Miss Murgatroyd did so rather clumsily shifting the trowel under one\narm while she did so.",
    "Now then said Miss Hinchliffe off you go.",
    "Remember the time you\nplayed Hermia in A Midsummer Nights Dream at the Womens Institute\n\n\fAct.",
    "Give it all youve got.",
    "Stick em up Those are your lines  and dont\nruin them by saying Please.",
    "Obediently Miss Murgatroyd raised her torch nourished the trowel and\nadvanced on the kitchen door.",
    "Transferring the torch to her right hand she swiftly turned the handle\nand stepped forward resuming the torch in her left hand.",
    "Stick em up she fluted adding vexedly Dear me this is very\ndifficult Hinch.",
    "Why\n\nThe door.",
    "Its a swing door it keeps coming back and Ive got both\nhands full.",
    "Exactly boomed Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "And the drawingroom door at Little\nPaddocks always swings to.",
    "It isnt a swing door like this but it wont\nstay open.",
    "Thats why Letty Blacklog bought that absolutely delectable\nheavy glass doorstop from Elliots in the High Street.",
    "I dont mind saying\nIve never forgiven her for getting in ahead of me there.",
    "I was beating\nthe old brute down from eight guineas to six pound ten and then\nBlacklog comes along and buys the damned thing.",
    "Id never seen as\nattractive a doorstop you dont often get those glass bubbles in that big\nsize.",
    "Perhaps the burglar put the doorstop against the door to keep it\nopen suggested Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "Use your common sense Murgatroyd.",
    "What does he do Throw the\ndoor open say excuse me a moment stoop and put the stop into\nposition and then resume business by saying Hands up Try holding\nthe door with your shoulder.",
    "Its still very awkward complained Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "Exactly said Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "A revolver a torch and a door to hold\nopen  a bit too much isnt it So whats the answer\n\nMiss Murgatroyd did not attempt to supply an answer.",
    "She looked\ninquiringly and admiringly at her masterful friend and waited to be\nenlightened.",
    "We know hed got a revolver because he fired it said Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "And we know he had a torch because we all saw it  that is unless\nwere all the victims of mass hypnotism like explanations of the Indian\nRope trick what a bore that old Easterbrook is with his Indian stories\nso the question is did someone hold that door open for him\n\nBut who could have done that\n\nWell you could have for one Murgatroyd.",
    "As far as I remember you\nwere standing directly behind it when the lights went out.",
    "Miss\nHinchliffe laughed heartily.",
    "Highly suspicious character arent you\nMurgatroyd But whod think it to look at you.",
    "Here give me that trowel\n thank heavens it isnt really a revolver.",
    "Youd have shot yourself by\nnow\n\n\fIV\n\nIts a most extraordinary thing muttered Colonel Easterbrook.",
    "Most\nextraordinary.",
    "Laura.",
    "Yes darling\n\nCome into my dressingroom a moment.",
    "What is it darling\n\nMrs. Easterbrook appeared through the open door.",
    "Remember my showing you that revolver of mine\n\nOh yes Archie a nasty horrid black thing.",
    "Yes.",
    "Hun souvenir.",
    "Was in this drawer wasnt it\n\nYes it was.",
    "Well its not there now.",

    "Shall I ask her\n\nNo  no better not.",
    "Dont want to start a lot of talk.",
    "Tell me do you\nremember when it was I showed it to you\n\nOh about a week ago.",
    "You were grumbling about your collars and the\nlaundry and you opened this drawer wide and there it was at the back\nand I asked you what it was.",
    "Yes thats right.",
    "About a week ago.",
    "You dont remember the date\n\nMrs. Easterbrook considered eyelids down over her eyes a shrewd\nbrain working.",
    "Of course she said.",
    "It was Saturday.",
    "The day we were to have gone\nin to the pictures but we didnt.",
    "Hm  sure it wasnt before that Wednesday Thursday or even the\nweek before that again\n\nNo dear said Mrs. Easterbrook.",
    "I remember quite distinctly.",
    "It was\nSaturday the 30th.",
    "It just seems a long time because of all the trouble\ntheres been.",
    "And I can tell you how I remember.",
    "Its because it was the\nday after the holdup at Miss Blacklogs.",
    "Because when I saw your\nrevolver it reminded me of the shooting the night before.",
    "Ah said Colonel Easterbrook then thats a great load off my mind.",
    "Oh Archie why\n\nJust because if that revolver had disappeared before the shooting well it might possibly have been my revolver that was pinched by that\nSwiss fellow.",
    "But how would he have known you had one\n\nThese gangs have a most extraordinary communication service.",
    "They\nget to know everything about a place and who lives there.",
    "What a lot you do know Archie.",
    "Ha.",
    "Yes.",
    "Seen a thing or two in my time.",
    "Still as you definitely\nremember seeing my revolver after the holdup  well that settles it.",
    "The revolver that Swiss fellow used cant have been mine can it\n\nOf course it cant.",
    "A great relief.",
    "I should have had to go to the police about it.",
    "And they\nask a lot of awkward questions.",
    "Bound to.",
    "As a matter of fact I never\ntook out a licence for it.",
    "Somehow after a war one forgets these\npeacetime regulations.",
    "I looked on it as a war souvenir not as a\nfirearm.",
    "Yes I see.",
    "Of course.",
    "But all the same  where on earth can the damned thing be\n\nPerhaps Mrs.",
    "Butt took it.",
    "Shes always seemed quite honest but\nperhaps she felt nervous after the holdup and thought shed like to  to\nhave a revolver in the house.",
    "Of course shell never admit doing that.",
    "I\nshant even ask her.",
    "She might get offended.",
    "And what should we do\nthen This is such a big house  I simply couldnt \n\nQuite so said Colonel Easterbrook.",
    "Better not say anything.",

    "But just as he decided that the charms of the Present from Tunbridge\nWells were about to be too much for the lady who was staying at the\nVicarage for of course Mr. Elliot like everybody else knew exactly\nwho she was Miss Marple saw out of the corner of her eye Miss Dora\nBunner entering the Bluebird Cafe and immediately decided that what\nshe needed to counteract the cold wind was a nice cup of morning\ncoffee.",
    "Four or five ladies were already engaged in sweetening their morning\nshopping by a pause for refreshment.",
    "Miss Marple blinking a little in\nthe gloom of the interior of the Bluebird and hovering artistically was\ngreeted by the voice of Dora Bunner at her elbow.",
    "Oh good morning Miss Marple.",
    "Do sit down here.",
    "Im all alone.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Miss Marple subsided gratefully on to the rather angular little bluepainted armchair which the Bluebird affected.",
    "Such a sharp wind she complained.",
    "And I cant walk very fast\nbecause of my rheumatic leg.",
    "Oh I know.",
    "I had sciatica one year  and really most of the time I was\nin agony.",
    "The two ladies talked rheumatism sciatica and neuritis for some\nmoments with avidity.",
    "A sulkylooking girl in a pink overall with a flight\nof bluebirds down the front of it took their order for coffee and cakes\nwith a yawn and an air of weary patience.",
    "The cakes Miss Bunner said in a conspiratorial whisper are really\nquite good here.",
    "I was so interested in that very pretty girl I met as we were coming\naway from Miss Blacklogs the other day said Miss Marple.",
    "I think she\nsaid she does gardening.",
    "Or is she on the land Hynes  was that her\nname\n\nOh yes Phillipa Haymes.",
    "Our Lodger as we call her.",
    "Miss Bunner\nlaughed at her own humour.",
    "Such a nice quiet girl.",
    "A lady if you know what I mean.",
    "I wonder now.",
    "I knew a Colonel Haymes  in the Indian cavalry.",
    "Her\nfather perhaps\n\n\fShes Mrs. Haymes.",
    "A widow.",
    "Her husband was killed in Sicily or Italy.",
    "Of course it might be his father.",
    "I wondered perhaps if there might be a little romance on the way\nMiss Marple suggested roguishly.",
    "With that tall young man\n\nWith Patrick do you mean Oh I dont \n\nNo I meant a young man with spectacles.",
    "Ive seen him about.",
    "Oh of course Edmund Swettenham.",
    "Sh Thats his mother Mrs.\nSwettenham over in the corner.",
    "I dont know Im sure.",
    "You think he\nadmires her Hes such an odd young man  says the most disturbing\nthings sometimes.",
    "Hes supposed to be clever you know said Miss\nBunner with frank disapproval.",
    "Cleverness isnt everything said Miss Marple shaking her head.",
    "Ah\nhere is our coffee.",
    "The sulky girl deposited it with a clatter.",
    "Miss Marple and Miss Bunner\npressed cakes on each other.",
    "I was so interested to hear you were at school with Miss Blacklog.",
    "Yours is indeed an old friendship.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Miss Bunner sighed.",
    "Very few people would be as loyal\nto their old friends as dear Miss Blacklog is.",
    "Oh dear those days seem\na long time ago.",
    "Such a pretty girl and enjoyed life so much.",
    "It all\nseemed so sad.",
    "Miss Marple though with no idea of what had seemed so sad sighed\nand shook her head.",
    "Life is indeed hard she murmured.",
    "And sad affliction bravely borne murmured Miss Bunner her eyes\nsuffusing with tears.",
    "I always think of that verse.",
    "True patience true\nresignation.",
    "Such courage and patience ought to be rewarded that is\nwhat I say.",
    "What I feel is that nothing is too good for dear Miss Blacklog\nand whatever good things come to her she truly deserves them.",
    "Money said Miss Marple can do a lot to ease ones path in life.",
    "She felt herself safe in this observation since she judged that it must be\nMiss Blacklogs prospects of future affluence to which her friend\nreferred.",
    "The remark however started Miss Bunner on another train of thought.",
    "Money she exclaimed with bitterness.",
    "I dont believe you know that\nuntil one has really experienced it one can know what money or rather\nthe lack of it means.",
    "Miss Marple nodded her white head sympathetically.",
    "Miss Bunner went on rapidly working herself up and speaking with a\nflushed face Ive heard people say so often Id rather have flowers on\nthe table than a meal without them.",
    "But how many meals have those\n\n\fpeople ever missed They dont know what it is  nobody knows who\nhasnt been through it  to be really hungry.",
    "Bread you know and a jar\nof meat paste and a scrape of margarine.",
    "Day after day and how one\nlongs for a good plate of meat and two vegetables.",
    "And the shabbiness.",
    "Darning ones clothes and hoping it wont show.",
    "And applying for jobs\nand always being told youre too old.",
    "And then perhaps getting a job\nand after all one isnt strong enough.",
    "One faints.",
    "And youre back again.",
    "Its the rent  always the rent  thats got to be paid  otherwise youre\nout in the street.",
    "And in these days it leaves so little over.",
    "Ones old age\npension doesnt go far  indeed it doesnt.",
    "I know said Miss Marple gently.",
    "She looked with compassion at Miss\nBunners twitching face.",
    "I wrote to Letty.",
    "I just happened to see her name in the paper.",
    "It was a\nluncheon in aid of Milchester Hospital.",
    "There it was in black and white.",
    "Miss Letitia Blacklog.",
    "It brought the past back to me.",
    "I hadnt heard of\nher for years and years.",
    "Shed been secretary you know to that very\nrich man Goedler.",
    "She was always a clever girl  the kind that gets on\nin the world.",
    "Not so much looks  as character.",
    "I thought  well I thought\n perhaps shell remember me  and shes one of the people I could ask\nfor a little help.",
    "I mean someone youve known as a girl  been at school\nwith  well they do know about you  they know youre not just a\nbegging letter writer \n\nTears came into Dora Bunners eyes.",
    "And then Lotty came and took me away  said she needed someone to\nhelp her.",
    "Of course I was very surprised  very surprised  but then\n\n\fnewspapers do get things wrong.",
    "How kind she was  and how\nsympathetic.",
    "And remembering all the old days so well... Id do anything\nfor her  I really would.",
    "And I try very hard but Im afraid sometimes I\nmuddle things  my heads not what it was.",
    "I make mistakes.",
    "And I\nforget and say foolish things.",
    "Shes very patient.",
    "Whats so nice about\nher is that she always pretends that I am useful to her.",
    "Thats real\nkindness isnt it\n\nMiss Marple said gently Yes thats real kindness.",
    "I used to worry you know even after I came to Little Paddocks  about\nwhat would become of me if anything were to happen to Miss Blacklog.",
    "After all there are so many accidents  these motors dashing about one\nnever knows does one But naturally I never said anything  but she\nmust have guessed.",
    "Suddenly one day she told me that shed left me a\nsmall annuity in her will and  what I value far more  all her beautiful\nfurniture.",
    "I was quite overcome...",
    "But she said nobody else would value\nit as I should  and that is quite true  I cant bear to see some lovely\npiece of china smashed  or wet glasses put down on a table and\nleaving a mark.",
    "I do really look after her things.",
    "Some people  some\npeople especially are so terribly careless  and sometimes worse than\ncareless\n\nIm not really as stupid as I look Miss Bunner continued with\nsimplicity.",
    "I can see you know when Lettys being imposed upon.",
    "Some people  I wont name names  but they take advantage.",
    "Dear Miss\nBlacklog is perhaps just a shade too trusting.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head.",
    "Thats a mistake.",
    "Yes it is.",
    "You and I Miss Marple know the world.",
    "Dear Miss Blacklog  She shook her head.",
    "Miss Marple thought that as the secretary of a big financier Miss\nBlacklog might be presumed to know the world too.",
    "But probably what\nDora Bunner meant was that Letty Blacklog had always been\ncomfortably off and that the comfortably off do not know the deeper\nabysses of human nature.",
    "That Patrick said Miss Bunner with a suddenness and an asperity\nthat made Miss Marple jump.",
    "Twice at least to my knowledge hes\ngot money out of her.",
    "Pretending hes hard up.",
    "Run into debt.",
    "All that\nsort of thing.",
    "Shes far too generous.",
    "All she said to me when I\nremonstrated with her was The boys young Dora.",
    "Youth is the time to\nhave your fling.",
    "Well thats true enough said Miss Marple.",
    "Such a handsome young\nman too.",
    "Handsome is as handsome does said Dora Bunner.",
    "Much too fond of\npoking fun at people.",
    "And a lot of going on with girls.",
    "I expect.",
    "Im just a\nfigure of fun to him  thats all.",
    "He doesnt seem to realise that people\nhave their feelings.",
    "Young people are rather careless that way said Miss Marple.",
    "Miss Bunner leaned forward suddenly with a mysterious air.",
    "You wont breathe a word will you my dear she demanded.",
    "But I\ncant help feeling that he was mixed up in this dreadful business.",
    "I think\nhe knew that young man  or else Julia did.",
    "I darent hint at such a thing\nto dear Miss Blacklog  at least I did and she just snapped my head off.",
    "And of course its awkward  because hes her nephew  or at any rate\nher cousin  and if the Swiss young man shot himself Patrick might be\nheld morally responsible mightnt he If hed put him up to it I mean.",
    "Im really terribly confused about the whole thing.",
    "Everyone making\nsuch a fuss about that other door into the drawingroom.",
    "Thats another\nthing that worries me  the detective saying it had been oiled.",
    "Because\nyou see I saw \n\nShe came to an abrupt stop.",
    "Miss Marple paused to select a phrase.",
    "Most difficult for you she said sympathetically.",
    "Naturally you\nwouldnt want anything to get round to the police.",
    "Thats just it Dora Bunner cried.",
    "I lie awake at nights and worry...\nbecause you see I came upon Patrick in the shrubbery the other day.",
    "I\nwas looking for eggs  one hen lays out  and there he was holding a\nfeather and a cup  an oily cup.",
    "And he jumped most guiltily when he\nsaw me and he said I was just wondering what this was doing here.",
    "Well of course hes a quick thinker.",
    "I should say he thought that up\nquickly when I startled him.",
    "And how did he come to find a thing like\nthat in the shrubbery unless he was looking for it knowing perfectly\nwell it was there.",
    "Of course I didnt say anything.",
    "No no of course not.",
    "But I gave him a look if you know what I mean.",
    "Dora Bunner stretched out her hand and bit abstractedly into a lurid\nsalmon coloured cake.",
    "And then another day I happened to overhear him having a very\ncurious conversation with Julia.",
    "They seemed to be having a kind of\nquarrel.",
    "He was saying If I thought you had anything to do with a thing\nlike that and Julia shes always so calm you know said Well little\nbrother what would you do about it And then most unfortunately I\ntrod on that board that always squeaks and they saw me.",
    "So I said\nquite gaily You two having a quarrel and Patrick said Im warning\nJulia not to go in for these black market deals.",
    "Oh it was all very slick\nbut I dont believe they were talking about anything of the sort And if\nyou ask me I believe Patrick had tampered with that lamp in the\ndrawingroom  to make the lights go out because I remember\ndistinctly that it was the shepherdess  not the shepherd.",
    "And the next\nday \n\nShe stopped and her face grew pink.",
    "Miss Marple turned her head to\nsee Miss Blacklog standing behind them  she must just have come in.",
    "Coffee and gossip Bunny said Miss Blacklog with quite a shade of\nreproach in her voice.",
    "Good morning Miss Marple.",
    "Cold isnt it\n\nWe were just talking said Miss Bunner hurriedly.",
    "So many rules and\nregulations nowadays.",
    "One really doesnt know where one is.",
    "The doors flew open with a clang and Bunch Harmon came into the\nBluebird with a rush.",
    "Hallo she said am I too late for coffee\n\nNo dear said Miss Marple.",
    "Sit down and have a cup.",
    "We must get home said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Done your shopping.",
    "Bunny\n\nHer tone was indulgent once more but her eyes still held a slight\nreproach.",
    "Yes  yes thank you Letty.",
    "I must just pop into the chemists in passing\nand get some aspirin and some cornplasters.",
    "As the doors of the Bluebird swung to behind them Bunch asked\n\nWhat were you talking about\n\nMiss Marple did not reply at once.",
    "She waited whilst Bunch gave the\norder then she said\n\nFamily solidarity is a very strong thing.",
    "Very strong.",
    "Do you remember\nsome famous case  I really cant remember what it was.",
    "They said the\nhusband poisoned his wife.",
    "In a glass of wine.",
    "Then at the trial the\ndaughter said shed drunk half her mothers glass  so that knocked the\ncase against her father to pieces.",
    "They do say  but that may be just\n\n\frumour  that she never spoke to her father or lived with him again.",
    "Of\ncourse a father is one thing  and a nephew or a distant cousin is\nanother.",
    "But still there it is  no one wants a member of their own family\nhanged do they\n\nNo said Bunch considering.",
    "I shouldnt think they would.",
    "Miss Marple leaned back in her chair.",
    "She murmured under her breath\nPeople are really very alike everywhere.",
    "Who am I like\n\nWell really dear you are very much like yourself.",
    "I dont know that\nyou remind me of anyone in particular.",
    "Except perhaps \n\nHere it comes said Bunch.",
    "I was just thinking of a parlourmaid of mine dear.",
    "A parlourmaid I should make a terrible parlourmaid.",
    "Yes dear so did she.",
    "She was no good at all at waiting at table.",
    "Put\neverything on the table crooked mixed up the kitchen knives with the\ndiningroom ones and her cap this was a long time ago dear her cap\nwas never straight.",
    "Bunch adjusted her hat automatically.",
    "Anything else she demanded anxiously.",
    "I kept her because she was so pleasant to have about the house  and\nbecause she used to make me laugh.",
    "I liked the way she said things\nstraight out.",
    "Came to me one day Of course I dont know mam she\nsays but Florrie the way she sits down its just like a married woman.",
    "And sure enough poor Florrie was in trouble  the gentlemanly assistant\nat the hairdressers.",
    "Fortunately it was in good time and I was able to\nhave a little talk with him and they had a very nice wedding and settled\ndown quite happily.",
    "She was a good girl Florrie but inclined to be\ntaken in by a gentlemanly appearance.",
    "She didnt do a murder did she asked Bunch.",
    "The parlourmaid I\nmean.",
    "No indeed said Miss Marple.",
    "She married a Baptist Minister and\nthey had a family of five.",
    "Just like me said Bunch.",
    "Though Ive only got as far as Edward and\nSusan up to date.",
    "She added after a minute or two Who are you thinking about now\nAunt Jane\n\nQuite a lot of people dear quite a lot of people said Miss Marple\nvaguely.",
    "In St. Mary Mead\n\n\fMostly...",
    "I was really thinking about Nurse Ellerton  really an excellent\nkindly woman.",
    "Took care of an old lady seemed really fond of her.",
    "Then\nthe old lady died.",
    "And another came and she died.",
    "Morphia.",
    "It all came\nout.",
    "Done in the kindest way and the shocking thing was that the\nwoman herself really couldnt see that shed done anything wrong.",
    "They\nhadnt long to live in any case she said and one of them had cancer\nand quite a lot of pain.",
    "You mean  it was a mercy killing\n\nNo no.",
    "They signed their money away to her.",
    "She liked money you\nknow...\n\nAnd then there was that young man on the liner  Mrs. Pusey at the\npaper shop her nephew.",
    "Brought home stuff hed stolen and got her to\ndispose of it.",
    "Said it was things that hed bought abroad.",
    "She was quite\ntaken in.",
    "And then when the police came round and started asking\nquestions he tried to bash her on the head so that she shouldnt be\nable to give him away... Not a nice young man  but very goodlooking.",
    "Had two girls in love with him.",
    "He spent a lot of money on one of them.",
    "The nastiest one I suppose said Bunch.",
    "Yes dear.",
    "And there was Mrs. Cray at the wool shop.",
    "Devoted to her\nson spoilt him of course.",
    "He got in with a very queer lot.",
    "Do you\nremember Joan Croft Bunch\n\nNno I dont think so.",
    "I thought you might have seen her when you were with me on a visit.",
    "Used to stalk about smoking a cigar or a pipe.",
    "We had a Bank holdup\nonce and Joan Croft was in the Bank at the time.",
    "She knocked the man\ndown and took his revolver away from him.",
    "She was congratulated on\nher courage by the Bench.",
    "Bunch listened attentively.",
    "She seemed to be learning by heart.",
    "And  she prompted.",
    "That girl at St. Jean des Collines that summer.",
    "Such a quiet girl  not so\nmuch quiet as silent.",
    "Everybody liked her but they never got to know\nher much better... We heard afterwards that her husband was a forger.",
    "It made her feel cut off from people.",
    "It made her in the end a little\nqueer.",
    "Brooding does you know.",
    "Any AngloIndian Colonels in your reminiscences darling\n\nNaturally dear.",
    "There was Major Vaughan at The Larches and Colonel\nWright at Simla Lodge.",
    "Nothing wrong with either of them.",
    "But I do\nremember Mr. Hodgson the Bank Manager went on a cruise and\nmarried a woman young enough to be his daughter.",
    "No idea of where\nshe came from  except what she told him of course.",
    "And that wasnt true\n\nNo dear it definitely wasnt.",
    "Not bad said Bunch nodding and ticking people off on her fingers.",
    "Weve\n\nhad\n\nSwettenham\n\ndevoted\nand\n\nDora\n\nEdmund\n\nand\nand\n\nhandsome\nPhillipa\n\nPatrick\n\nHaymes\n\nand\n\nand\n\nMrs.",
    "Colonel\n\nEasterbrook and Mrs. Easterbrook  and if you ask me I should say\nyoure absolutely right about her.",
    "But there wouldnt be any reason for\nher murdering Letty Blacklog.",
    "Miss Blacklog of course might know something about her that she\ndidnt want known.",
    "Oh darling that old Tanqueray stuff Surely thats dead as the hills.",
    "It might not be.",
    "You see Bunch you are not the kind that minds much\nabout what people think of you.",
    "I see what you mean said Bunch suddenly.",
    "If youd been up against\nit and then rather like a shivering stray cat youd found a home and a\ncream and a warm stroking hand and you were called Pretty Pussy and\nsomebody thought the world of you... Youd do a lot to keep that... Well\nI must say youve presented me with a very complete gallery of\npeople.",
    "You didnt get them all right you know said Miss Marple mildly.",
    "Didnt I Where did I slip up Julia Julia pretty Juliar is peculiar.",
    "Three and sixpence said the sulky waitress materialising out of the\ngloom.",
    "And she added her bosom heaving beneath the bluebirds Id like to\nknow Mrs. Harmon why you call me peculiar.",
    "I had an aunt who joined\nthe Peculiar People but Ive always been good Church of England\nmyself as the late Rev.",
    "Hopkinson can tell you.",
    "Im terribly sorry said Bunch.",
    "I was just quoting a song.",
    "I didnt\nmean you at all.",
    "I didnt know your name was Julia.",
    "Quite a coincidence said the sulky waitress cheering up.",
    "No\noffence Im sure but hearing my name as I thought  well naturally if\nyou think someones talking about you its only human nature to listen.",
    "Thank you.",
    "She departed with her tip.",
    "Aunt Jane said Bunch dont look so upset.",
    "What is it\n\nBut surely murmured Miss Marple.",
    "That couldnt be so.",
    "Theres no\nreason \n\nAunt Jane\n\nMiss Marple sighed and then smiled brightly.",
    "Its nothing dear she said.",
    "Did you think you knew who did the murder asked Bunch.",
    "Who was\nit\n\n\fI dont know at all said Miss Marple.",
    "I got an idea for a moment  but\nits gone.",
    "I wish I did know.",
    "Times so short.",
    "So terribly short.",
    "What do you mean short\n\nThat old lady up in Scotland may die any moment.",
    "Bunch said staring Then you really do believe in Pip and Emma.",
    "You\nthink it was them  and that theyll try again\n\nOf course theyll try again said Miss Marple almost absentmindedly.",
    "If they tried once theyll try again.",
    "If youve made up your mind to\nmurder someone you dont stop because the first time it didnt come off.",
    "Especially if youre fairly sure youre not suspected.",
    "But if its Pip and Emma said Bunch there are only two people it\ncould be.",
    "It must be Patrick and Julia.",
    "Theyre brother and sister and\ntheyre the only ones who are the right age.",
    "My dear it isnt nearly as simple as that.",
    "There are all sort of\nramifications and combinations.",
    "Theres Pips wife if hes married or\nEmmas husband.",
    "Theres their mother  shes an interested party even\nif she doesnt inherit direct.",
    "If Letty Blacklog hasnt seen her for thirty\nyears shed probably not recognise her now.",
    "One elderly woman is\nvery like another.",
    "You remember Mrs. Wotherspoon drew her own and\nMrs. Bartletts Old Age Pension although Mrs. Bartlett had been dead\nfor years.",
    "Anyway Miss Blacklogs shortsighted.",
    "Havent you noticed\nhow she peers at people And then theres the father.",
    "Apparently he\nwas a real bad lot.",
    "Yes but hes a foreigner.",
    "By birth.",
    "But theres no reason to believe he speaks broken English\nand gesticulates with his hands.",
    "I dare say he could play the part of  of\nan AngloIndian Colonel as well as anybody else.",
    "Is that what you think\n\nNo I dont.",
    "I dont indeed dear.",
    "I just think that theres a great deal of\nmoney at stake a great deal of money.",
    "And Im afraid I know only too\nwell the really terrible things that people will do to lay their hands on a\nlot of money.",
    "I suppose they will said Bunch.",
    "It doesnt really do them any good\ndoes it Not in the end\n\nNo  but they dont usually know that.",
    "I can understand it.",
    "Bunch smiled suddenly her sweet rather crooked\nsmile.",
    "One feels it would be different for oneself...",
    "Even I feel that.",
    "She considered You pretend to yourself that youd do a lot of good\nwith all that money.",
    "Schemes... Homes for Unwanted Children...",
    "Tired\nMothers... A lovely rest abroad somewhere for elderly women who have\nworked too hard...",
    "Her face grew sombre.",
    "Her eyes were suddenly dark and tragic.",
    "I know what youre thinking she said to Miss Marple.",
    "Youre thinking\nthat Id be the worst kind.",
    "Because Id kid myself.",
    "If you just wanted the\nmoney for selfish reasons youd at any rate see what you were like.",
    "But\nonce you began to pretend about doing good with it youd be able to\npersuade yourself perhaps that it wouldnt very much matter killing\nsomeone...\n\nThen her eyes cleared.",
    "But I shouldnt she said.",
    "I shouldnt really kill anyone.",
    "Not even if\nthey were old or ill or doing a lot of harm in the world.",
    "Not even if they\nwere blackmailers or  or absolute beasts.",
    "She fished a fly carefully\nout of the dregs of the coffee and arranged it on the table to dry.",
    "Because people like living dont they So do flies.",
    "Even if youre old\nand in pain and you can just crawl out in the sun.",
    "Julian says those\npeople like living even more than young strong people do.",
    "Its harder\nfor them to die the struggles greater.",
    "I like living myself  not just being\nhappy and enjoying myself and having a good time.",
    "I mean living waking up and feeling all over me that Im there  ticking over.",
    "She blew on the fly gently it waved its legs and flew rather drunkenly\naway.",
    "Cheer up darling Aunt Jane said Bunch.",
    "Id never kill anybody.",
    "Chapter 14 EXCURSION INTO THE PAST\n\nAfter a night in the train Inspector Craddock alighted at a small station\nin the Highlands.",
    "It struck him for a moment as strange that the wealthy Mrs. Goedler  an\ninvalid  with a choice of a London house in a fashionable square an\nestate in Hampshire and a villa in the South of France should have\nselected this remote Scottish home as her residence.",
    "Surely she was\ncut off here from many friends and distractions.",
    "It must be a lonely life or was she too ill to notice or care about her surroundings\n\nA car was waiting to meet him.",
    "A big oldfashioned Daimler with an\nelderly chauffeur driving it.",
    "It was a sunny morning and the inspector\nenjoyed the twenty mile drive though he marvelled anew at this\npreference for isolation.",
    "A tentative remark to the chauffeur brought\npartial enlightenment.",
    "Its her own home as a girl.",
    "Ay shes the last of the family.",
    "And she and\nMr. Goedler were always happier here than anywhere though it wasnt\noften he could get away from London.",
    "But when he did they enjoyed\nthemselves like a couple of bairns.",
    "When the grey walls of the old keep came in sight Craddock felt that\ntime was slipping backwards.",
    "An elderly butler received him and after\na wash and a shave he was shown into a room with a huge fire burning\nin the grate and breakfast was served to him.",
    "After breakfast a tall middleaged woman in nurses dress with a\npleasant and competent manner came in and introduced herself as\nSister McClelland.",
    "I have my patient all ready for you Mr. Craddock.",
    "She is indeed\nlooking forward to seeing you.",
    "Ill do my best not to excite her Craddock promised.",
    "I had better warn you of what will happen.",
    "You will find Mrs. Goedler\napparently quite normal.",
    "She will talk and enjoy talking and then  quite\nsuddenly  her powers will fail.",
    "Come away at once then and send for\nme.",
    "She is you see kept almost entirely under the influence of morphia.",
    "She drowses most of the time.",
    "In preparation for your visit I have given\nher a strong stimulant.",
    "As soon as the effect of the stimulant wears off\nshe will relapse into semiconsciousness.",
    "I quite understand Miss McClelland.",
    "Would it be in order for you to tell\nme exactly what the state of Mrs. Goedlers health is\n\nWell Mr. Craddock she is a dying woman.",
    "Her life cannot be\nprolonged for more than a few weeks.",
    "To say that she should have been\ndead years ago would strike you as odd yet it is the truth.",
    "What has\nkept Mrs. Goedler alive is her intense enjoyment and love of being alive.",
    "That sounds perhaps an odd thing to say of someone who has lived\nthe life of an invalid for many years and has not left her home here for\nfifteen years but it is true.",
    "Mrs. Goedler has never been a strong\nwoman  but she has retained to an astonishing degree the will to live.",
    "She added with a smile She is a very charming woman too as you will\nfind.",
    "Craddock was shown into a large bedroom where a fire was burning\nand where an old lady lay in a large canopied bed.",
    "Though she was only\n\n\fabout seven or eight years older than Letitia Blacklog her fragility\nmade her seem older than her years.",
    "Her white hair was carefully arranged a froth of pale blue wool\nenveloped her neck and shoulders.",
    "There were lines of pain on the face\nbut lines of sweetness too.",
    "And there was strangely enough what\nCraddock could only describe as a roguish twinkle in her faded blue\neyes.",
    "Well this is interesting she said.",
    "Its not often I receive a visit from\nthe police.",
    "I hear Letitia Blacklog wasnt much hurt by this attempt on\nher How is my dear Blackie\n\nShes very well Mrs. Goedler.",
    "She sent you her love.",
    "Its a long time since Ive seen her... For many years now its been just\na card at Christmas.",
    "I asked her to come up here when she came back\nto England after Charlottes death but she said it would be painful after\nso long and perhaps she was right... Blackie always had a lot of sense.",
    "I\nhad an old school friend to see me about a year ago  she smiled  we\nbored each other to death.",
    "After wed finished all the Do you\nremembers there wasnt anything to say.",
    "Most embarrassing.",
    "Craddock was content to let her talk before pressing his questions.",
    "He\nwanted as it were to get back into the past to get the feel of the\nGoedlerBlacklog m\u00e9nage.",
    "I suppose said Belle shrewdly that you want to ask about the\nmoney Randall left it all to go to Blackie after my death.",
    "Really of\n\n\fcourse Randall never dreamed that Id outlive him.",
    "He was a big strong\nman never a days illness and I was always a mass of aches and pains\nand complaints and doctors coming and pulling long faces over me.",
    "I dont think complaints would be the right word Mrs. Goedler.",
    "The old lady chuckled.",
    "I didnt mean it in the complaining sense.",
    "Ive never been too sorry for\nmyself.",
    "But it was always taken for granted that I being the weakly one\nwould go first.",
    "It didnt work out that way.",
    "No  it didnt work out that\nway...\n\nWhy exactly did your husband leave his money the way he did\n\nYou mean why did he leave it to Blackie Not for the reason youve\nprobably been thinking.",
    "The roguish twinkle was very apparent.",
    "What\nminds you policemen have Randall was never in the least in love with\nher and she wasnt with him.",
    "Letitia you know has really got a mans\nmind.",
    "She hasnt any feminine feelings or weaknesses.",
    "I dont believe\nshe was ever in love with any man.",
    "She was never particularly pretty\nand she didnt care for clothes.",
    "She used a little makeup in deference\nto prevailing custom but not to make herself look prettier.",
    "There was\npity in the old voice as she went on She never knew any of the fun of\nbeing a woman.",
    "Craddock looked at the frail little figure in the big bed\nwith interest.",
    "Belle Goedler he realised had enjoyed  still enjoyed being a woman.",
    "She twinkled at him.",
    "Ive always thought she said it must be terribly dull to be a man.",
    "Then she said thoughtfully\n\nI think Randall looked on Blackie very much as a kind of younger\nbrother.",
    "He relied on her judgment which was always excellent.",
    "She\nkept him out of trouble more than once you know.",
    "She told me that she came to his rescue once with money\n\nThat yes but I meant more than that.",
    "One can speak the truth after all\nthese years.",
    "Randall couldnt really distinguish between what was\ncrooked and what wasnt.",
    "His conscience wasnt sensitive.",
    "The poor\ndear really didnt know what was just smart  and what was dishonest.",
    "Blackie kept him straight.",
    "Thats one thing about Letitia Blacklog shes\nabsolutely dead straight.",
    "She would never do anything that was\ndishonest.",
    "Shes a very fine character you know.",
    "Ive always admired\nher.",
    "They had a terrible girlhood those girls.",
    "The father was an old\ncountry doctor  terrifically pigheaded and narrowminded  the\ncomplete family tyrant.",
    "Letitia broke away came to London and\ntrained herself as a chartered accountant.",
    "The other sister was an\ninvalid there was a deformity of kinds and she never saw people or\nwent out.",
    "Thats why when the old man died Letitia gave up everything\nto go home and look after her sister.",
    "Randall was wild with her  but it\nmade no difference.",
    "If Letitia thought a thing was her duty shed do it.",
    "And you couldnt move her.",
    "How long was that before your husband died\n\n\fA couple of years I think.",
    "Randall made his will before she left the firm\nand he didnt alter it.",
    "He said to me Weve no one of our own.",
    "Our little\nboy died you know when he was two years old.",
    "After you and I are\ngone Blackie had better have the money.",
    "Shell play the markets and\nmake em sit up.",
    "You see Belle went on Randall enjoyed the whole moneymaking\ngame so much  it wasnt just the money  it was the adventure the risks\nthe excitement of it all.",
    "And Blackie liked it too.",
    "She had the same\nadventurous spirit and the same judgment.",
    "Poor darling shed never\nhad any of the usual fun  being in love and leading men on and teasing\nthem  and having a home and children and all the real fun of life.",
    "Craddock thought it was odd the real pity and indulgent contempt felt\nby this woman a woman whose life had been hampered by illness\nwhose only child had died whose husband had died leaving her to a\nlonely widowhood and who had been a hopeless invalid for years.",
    "She nodded her head at him.",
    "I know what youre thinking.",
    "But Ive had all the things that make life\nworthwhile  they may have been taken from me  but I have had them.",
    "I\nwas pretty and gay as a girl I married the man I loved and he never\nstopped loving me... My child died but I had him for two precious\nyears... Ive had a lot of physical pain but if you have pain you know\nhow to enjoy the exquisite pleasure of the times when pain stops.",
    "And\neveryones been kind to me always... Im a lucky woman really.",
    "Craddock seized upon an opening in her former remarks.",
    "You said just now Mrs. Goedler that your husband left his fortune to\nMiss Blacklog because he had no one else to leave it to.",
    "But thats not\nstrictly true is it He had a sister.",
    "Oh Sonia.",
    "But they quarrelled years ago and made a clean break of\nit.",
    "He disapproved of her marriage\n\nYes she married a man called  now what was his name\n\nStamfordis.",
    "Thats it.",
    "Dmitri Stamfordis.",
    "Randall always said he was a crook.",
    "The\ntwo men didnt like each other from the first.",
    "But Sonia was wildly in\nlove with him and quite determined to marry him.",
    "And I really never saw\nwhy she shouldnt.",
    "Men have such odd ideas about these things.",
    "Sonia\nwasnt a mere girl  she was twentyfive and she knew exactly what she\nwas doing.",
    "He was a crook I dare say  I mean really a crook.",
    "I believe\nhe had a criminal record  and Randall always suspected the name he\nwas passing under here wasnt his own.",
    "Sonia knew all that.",
    "The point\nwas which of course Randall couldnt appreciate that Dmitri was really\na wildly attractive person to women.",
    "And he was just as much in love\nwith Sonia as she was with him.",
    "Randall insisted that he was just\nmarrying her for her money but that wasnt true.",
    "Sonia was very\nhandsome you know.",
    "And she had plenty of spirit.",
    "If the marriage had\nturned out badly if Dmitri had been unkind to her or unfaithful to her\n\n\fshe would just have cut her losses and walked out on him.",
    "She was a\nrich woman and could do as she chose with her life.",
    "The quarrel was never made up\n\nNo.",
    "Randall and Sonia never had got on very well.",
    "She resented his\ntrying to prevent the marriage.",
    "She said Very well.",
    "Youre quite\nimpossible This is the last you hear of me\n\nBut it was not the last you heard of her\n\nBelle smiled.",
    "No I got a letter from her about eighteen months afterwards.",
    "She\nwrote from Budapest I remember but she didnt give an address.",
    "She\ntold me to tell Randall that she was extremely happy and that shed just\nhad twins.",
    "And she told you their names\n\nAgain Belle smiled.",
    "She said they were born just after midday  and\nshe intended to call them Pip and Emma.",
    "That may have been just a\njoke of course.",
    "Didnt you hear from her again\n\nNo.",
    "She said she and her husband and the babies were going to\nAmerica on a short stay.",
    "I never heard any more...\n\n\fYou dont happen I suppose to have kept that letter\n\nNo Im afraid not...",
    "I read it to Randall and he first grunted Shell\nregret marrying that fellow one of these days.",
    "Thats all he ever said\nabout it.",
    "We really forgot about her.",
    "She went right out of our lives...",
    "Nevertheless Mr. Goedler left his estate to her children in the event of\nMiss Blacklog predeceasing you\n\nOh that was my doing.",
    "I said to him when he told me about the will\nAnd suppose Blackie dies before I do He was quite surprised.",
    "I said\nOh I know Blackie is as strong as a horse and Im a delicate creature\nbut theres such a thing as accidents you know and theres such a\nthing as creaking gates... And he said Theres no one  absolutely no\none.",
    "I said Theres Sonia.",
    "And he said at once And let that fellow get\nhold of my money No  indeed I said Well her children then.",
    "Pip and\nEmma and there may be lots more by now and so he grumbled but he\ndid put it in.",
    "And from that day to this Craddock said slowly youve heard\nnothing of your sisterinlaw or her children\n\nNothing  they may be dead  they may be  anywhere.",
    "They may be in Chipping Cleghorn thought Craddock.",
    "As though she read his thoughts a look of alarm came into Belle\nGoedlers eyes.",
    "She said Dont let them hurt Blackie.",
    "Blackies good really good  you mustnt let harm come to \n\n\fHer voice trailed off suddenly.",
    "Craddock saw the sudden grey shadows\nround her mouth and eyes.",
    "Youre tired he said.",
    "Ill go.",
    "She nodded.",
    "Send Mac to me she whispered.",
    "Yes tired...\n\nShe made a feeble motion of her hand.",
    "Look after Blackie...",
    "Nothing\nmust happen to Blackie... look after her...\n\nIll do my very best Mrs. Goedler.",
    "He rose and went to the door.",
    "Her voice a thin thread of sound followed him...\n\nNot long now  until Im dead  dangerous for her  take care...",
    "Sister McClelland passed him as he went out.",
    "He said uneasily\n\nI hope I havent done her harm.",
    "Oh I dont think so Mr. Craddock.",
    "I told you she would tire quite\nsuddenly.",
    "Later he asked the nurse\n\n\fThe only thing I hadnt time to ask Mrs. Goedler was whether she had\nany old photographs If so I wonder \n\nShe interrupted him.",
    "Im afraid theres nothing of that kind.",
    "All her personal papers and\nthings were stored with their furniture from the London house at the\nbeginning of the war.",
    "Mrs. Goedler was desperately ill at the time.",
    "Then\nthe storage depository was blitzed.",
    "Mrs. Goedler was very upset at\nlosing so many personal souvenirs and family papers.",
    "Im afraid theres\nnothing of that kind.",
    "So that was that Craddock thought.",
    "Yet he felt his journey had not been in vain.",
    "Pip and Emma those twin\nwraiths were not quite wraiths.",
    "Craddock thought Heres a brother and sister brought up somewhere\nin Europe.",
    "Sonia Goedler was a rich woman at the time of her marriage\nbut money in Europe hasnt remained money.",
    "Queer things have\nhappened to money during these war years.",
    "And so there are two\nyoung people the son and daughter of a man who had a criminal record.",
    "Suppose they came to England more or less penniless.",
    "What would\nthey do Find out about any rich relatives.",
    "Their uncle a man of vast\nfortune is dead.",
    "Possibly the first thing theyd do would be to look up\nthat uncles will.",
    "See if by any chance money had been left to them or to\ntheir mother.",
    "They go to Somerset House and learn the contents of his\nwill and then perhaps they learn of the existence of Miss Letitia\nBlacklog.",
    "Then they make inquiries about Randall Goedlers widow.",
    "Shes an invalid living up in Scotland and they find out she hasnt long\nto live.",
    "If this Letitia Blacklog dies before her they will come into a vast\nfortune.",
    "What then\n\nCraddock thought They wouldnt go to Scotland.",
    "Theyd find out\nwhere Letitia Blacklog is living now.",
    "And theyd go there  but not as\nthemselves... Theyd go together  or separately Emma...",
    "I wonder...\nPip and Emma... Ill eat my hat if Pip or Emma or both of them arent in\nChipping Cleghorn now...\n\nChapter 15 DELICIOUS DEATH\n\nIn the kitchen at Little Paddocks Miss Blacklog was giving instructions\nto Mitzi.",
    "Sardine sandwiches as well as the tomato ones.",
    "And some of those\nlittle scones you make so nicely.",
    "And Id like you to make that special\ncake of yours.",
    "Is it a party then that you want all these things\n\nIts Miss Bunners birthday and some people will be coming to tea.",
    "At her age one does not have birthdays.",
    "It is better to forget.",
    "Well she doesnt want to forget Several people are bringing her\npresents  and it will be nice to make a little party of it.",
    "That is what you say last time  and see what happened\n\nMiss Blacklog controlled her temper.",
    "Well it wont happen this time.",
    "How do you know what may happen in this house All day long I shiver\nand at night I lock my door and I look in the wardrobe to see no one is\nhidden there.",
    "That ought to keep you nice and safe said Miss Blacklog coldly.",
    "The cake that you want me to make it is the \n\nMitzi uttered a sound that to Miss Blacklogs English ear sounded like\nSchwitzebzr or alternatively like cats spitting at each other.",
    "Thats the one.",
    "The rich one.",
    "Yes.",
    "It is rich.",
    "For it have I nothing Impossible to make such a cake.",
    "I\nneed for it chocolate and much butter and sugar and raisins.",
    "You can use this tin of butter that was sent us from America.",
    "And some\nof the raisins we were keeping for Christmas and here is a slab of\nchocolate and a pound of sugar.",
    "Mitzis face suddenly burst into radiant smiles.",
    "So I make him for you good  good she cried in an ecstasy.",
    "It will be\nrich rich of a melting richness And on top I will put the icing chocolate icing  I make him so nice  and write on it Good Wishes.",
    "These English people with their cakes that tastes of sand never never\nwill they have tasted such a cake.",
    "Delicious they will say  delicious \n\nHer face clouded again.",
    "Mr. Patrick.",
    "He called it Delicious Death.",
    "My cake I will not have my\ncake called that\n\nIt was a compliment really said Miss Blacklog.",
    "He meant it was\nworth dying to eat such a cake.",
    "Mitzi looked at her doubtfully.",
    "Well I do not like that word  death.",
    "They are not dying because they\neat my cake no they feel much much better...\n\nIm sure we all shall.",
    "Miss Blacklog turned away and left the kitchen with a sigh of relief at\nthe successful ending of the interview.",
    "With Mitzi one never knew.",
    "She ran into Dora Bunner outside.",
    "Oh Letty shall I run in and tell Mitzi just how to cut the sandwiches\n\n\fNo said Miss Blacklog steering her friend firmly into the hall.",
    "Shes\nin a good mood now and I dont want her disturbed.",
    "But I could just show her \n\nPlease dont show her anything Dora.",
    "These central Europeans dont\nlike being shown.",
    "They hate it.",
    "Dora looked at her doubtfully.",
    "Then she suddenly broke into smiles.",
    "Edmund Swettenham just rang up.",
    "He wished me many happy returns\nof the day and said he was bringing me a pot of honey as a present this\nafternoon.",
    "Isnt it kind I cant imagine how he knew it was my\nbirthday.",
    "Everybody seems to know.",
    "You must have been talking about it Dora.",
    "Well I did just happen to mention that today I should be fiftynine\n\nYoure sixtyfour said Miss Blacklog with a twinkle.",
    "And Miss Hinchliffe said You dont look it.",
    "What age do you think I\nam Which was rather awkward because Miss Hinchcliffe always looks\nso peculiar that she might be any age.",
    "She said she was bringing me\nsome eggs by the way.",
    "I said our hens hadnt been laying very well\nlately.",
    "Were not doing so badly out of your birthday said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Honey eggs  a magnificent box of chocolates from Julia \n\nI dont know where she gets such things.",
    "Better not ask.",
    "Her methods are probably strictly illegal.",
    "And your lovely brooch.",
    "Miss Bunner looked down proudly at her\nbosom on which was pinned a small diamond leaf.",
    "Do you like it Im glad.",
    "I never cared for jewellery.",
    "I love it.",
    "Good.",
    "Lets go and feed the ducks.",
    "II\n\nHa cried Patrick dramatically as the party took their places round\nthe diningroom table.",
    "What do I see before me Delicious Death.",
    "Hush said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Dont let Mitzi hear you.",
    "She objects to\nyour name for her cake very much.",
    "Nevertheless Delicious Death it is Is it Bunnys birthday cake\n\nYes it is said Miss Bunner.",
    "I really am having the most wonderful\nbirthday.",
    "Her cheeks were flushed with excitement and had been ever since\nColonel Easterbrook had handed her a small box of sweets and\ndeclaimed with a bow Sweets to the Sweet\n\nJulia had turned her head away hurriedly and had been frowned at by\nMiss Blacklog.",
    "Full justice was done to the good things on the tea table and they rose\nfrom their seats after a round of crackers.",
    "I feel slightly sick said Julia.",
    "Its that cake.",
    "I remember I felt just the\nsame last time.",
    "Its worth it said Patrick.",
    "These foreigners certainly understand confectionery said Miss Hinch.",
    "What they cant make is a plain boiled pudding.",
    "Everybody was respectfully silent though it seemed to be hovering on\nPatricks lips to ask if anyone really wanted a plain boiled pudding.",
    "Got a new gardener asked Miss Hinchliffe of Miss Blacklog as they\nreturned to the drawingroom.",
    "No why\n\nSaw a man snooping round the henhouse.",
    "Quite a decentlooking\nArmy type.",
    "Oh that said Julia.",
    "Thats our detective.",
    "Mrs. Easterbrook dropped her handbag.",
    "Detective she exclaimed.",
    "Butbutwhy\n\nI dont know said Julia.",
    "He prowls about and keeps an eye on the\nhouse.",
    "Hes protecting Aunt Letty I suppose.",
    "Absolute nonsense said Miss Blacklog.",
    "I can protect myself thank\nyou.",
    "But surely its all over now cried Mrs. Easterbrook.",
    "Though I meant\nto ask you why did they adjourn the inquest\n\nPolice arent satisfied said her husband.",
    "Thats what that means.",
    "But arent satisfied of what\n\nColonel Easterbrook shook his head  with the air of a man who could\nsay a good deal more if he chose.",
    "Edmund who disliked the Colonel said The truth of it is were all\nunder suspicion.",
    "But suspicion of what repeated Mrs. Easterbrook.",
    "Never mind kitten said her husband.",
    "Loitering with intent said Edmund.",
    "The intent being to commit\nmurder upon the first opportunity.",
    "Oh dont please dont Mr. Swettenham.",
    "Dora Bunner began to cry.",
    "Im sure nobody here could possibly want to kill dear dear Letty.",
    "There was a moment of horrible embarrassment.",
    "Edmund turned\nscarlet murmured Just a joke.",
    "Phillipa suggested in a high clear\nvoice that they might listen to the six oclock news and the suggestion\nwas received with enthusiastic assent.",
    "Patrick murmured to Julia We need Mrs. Harmon here.",
    "Shed be sure\nto say in that high clear voice of hers But I suppose somebody is still\nwaiting for a good chance to murder you Miss Blacklog\n\nIm glad she and that old Miss Marple couldnt come said Julia.",
    "That\nold woman is the prying kind.",
    "And a mind like a sink I should think.",
    "Real\nVictorian type.",
    "Listening to the news led easily into a pleasant discussion on the\nhorrors of atomic warfare.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook said that the real\nmenace to civilization was undoubtedly Russia and Edmund said that\nhe had several charming Russian friends  which announcement was\ncoldly received.",
    "The party broke up with renewed thanks to the hostess.",
    "Enjoy yourself Bunny asked Miss Blacklog as the last guest was\nsped.",
    "Oh I did.",
    "But Ive got a terrible headache.",
    "Its the excitement I think.",
    "Its the cake said Patrick.",
    "I feel a bit liverish myself.",
    "And youve been\nnibbling chocolates all the morning.",
    "Ill go and lie down I think said Miss Bunner.",
    "Ill take a couple of\naspirins and try and have a nice sleep.",
    "That would be a very good plan said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Miss Bunner departed upstairs.",
    "Shall I shut up the ducks for you Aunt Letty\n\nMiss Blacklog looked at Patrick severely.",
    "If youll be sure to latch that door properly.",
    "I will.",
    "I swear I will.",
    "Have a glass of sherry Aunt Letty said Julia.",
    "As my old nurse used\nto say It will settle your stomach.",
    "A revolting phrase  but curiously\napposite at this moment.",
    "Well I dare say it might be a good thing.",
    "The truth is one isnt used to\nrich things.",
    "Oh Bunny how you made me jump.",
    "What is it\n\nI cant find my aspirin said Miss Bunner disconsolately.",

    "This house is\nchock full of aspirin.",
    "It vexes me to be so careless and mislay things replied Miss Bunner\nretreating up the stairs again.",
    "Poor old Bunny said Julia holding up her glass.",
    "Do you think we\nought to have given her some sherry\n\nBetter not I think said Miss Blacklog.",
    "She had a lot of excitement\ntoday and it isnt really good for her.",
    "Im afraid shell be the worse for it\ntomorrow.",
    "Still I really do think she has enjoyed herself\n\nShes loved it said Phillipa.",
    "Lets give Mitzi a glass of sherry suggested Julia.",
    "Hi Pat she called as she heard him entering the side door fetch\nMitzi.",
    "So Mitzi was brought in and Julia poured her out a glass of sherry.",
    "Heres to the best cook in the world said Patrick.",
    "Mitzi was gratified  but felt nevertheless that a protest was due.",
    "That is not so.",
    "I am not really a cook.",
    "In my country I do intellectual\nwork.",
    "Then youre wasted said Patrick.",
    "Whats intellectual work compared\nto a chef doeuvre like Delicious Death\n\nOo  I say to you I do not like \n\nNever mind what you like my girl said Patrick.",
    "Thats my name for it\nand heres to it.",
    "Lets all drink to Delicious Death and to hell with the\naftereffects.",

    "There isnt anything\nwrong is there\n\nOh no Miss Blacklog.",
    "What should there be\n\nWell  I wondered.",
    "I thought perhaps that you and Patrick\n\nPatrick Phillipa looked really surprised.",
    "Its not so then.",
    "Please forgive me if Ive been impertinent.",
    "But youve\nbeen thrown together a lot and although Patrick is my cousin I dont\nthink hes the type to make a satisfactory husband.",
    "Not for some time to\ncome at all events.",
    "Phillipas face had frozen into a hard immobility.",
    "I shant marry again she said.",
    "Oh yes you will someday my child.",

    "Apart from Bunnys legacy everything goes to you\nPhillipa.",
    "What Phillipa spun round.",
    "Her eyes stared.",
    "She looked dismayed\nalmost frightened.",
    "But I dont want it  really I dont... Oh Id rather not... And anyway\nwhy Why to me\n\nPerhaps said Miss Blacklog in a peculiar voice because theres no\none else.",
    "But theres Patrick and Julia.",
    "Yes theres Patrick and Julia.",
    "The odd note in Miss Blacklogs voice\nwas still there.",
    "They are your relations.",
    "Very distant ones.",
    "They have no claim on me.",
    "But I  I havent either  I dont know what you think... Oh I dont want\nit.",
    "Her gaze held more hostility than gratitude.",
    "There was something\nalmost like fear in her manner.",

    "But youre not going to die Phillipa protested.",
    "Not if I can avoid it by taking due precautions.",
    "Precautions\n\nYes.",

    "So you heard \n\nYes I heard.",
    "I rather think I was meant to hear.",

    "His\ndreams had been less dreams than nightmares.",
    "Again and again he\nwas racing through the grey corridors of an oldworld castle in a\ndesperate attempt to get somewhere or to prevent something in time.",
    "Finally he dreamt that he awoke.",
    "An enormous relief surged over him.",
    "Then the door of his compartment slid slowly open and Letitia Blacklog\nlooked in at him with blood running down her face and said\nreproachfully\n\n\fWhy didnt you save me You could have if youd tried.",
    "This time he really awoke.",
    "Altogether the inspector was thankful finally to reach Milchester.",
    "He\nwent straight away to make his report to Rydesdale who listened\ncarefully.",
    "It doesnt take us much further he said.",
    "But it confirms what Miss\nBlacklog told you.",
    "Pip and Emma  hm I wonder.",
    "Patrick and Julia Simmons are the right age sir.",
    "If we could establish\nthat Miss Blacklog hadnt seen them since they were children \n\nWith a very faint chuckle Rydesdale said Our ally Miss Marple has\nestablished that for us.",
    "Actually Miss Blacklog had never seen either of\nthem at all until two months ago.",
    "Then surely sir \n\nIts not so easy as all that Craddock.",
    "Weve been checking up.",
    "On\nwhat weve got Patrick and Julia seem definitely to be out of it.",
    "His\nNaval record is genuine \n\nquite a good record bar a tendency to\n\ninsubordination.",
    "Weve checked with Cannes and an indignant Mrs.\nSimmons says of course her son and daughter are at Chipping\nCleghorn with her cousin Letitia Blacklog.",
    "So thats that\n\nAnd Mrs. Simmons is Mrs. Simmons\n\n\fShes been Mrs. Simmons for a very long time thats all I can say said\nRydesdale dryly.",
    "That seems clear enough.",
    "Only  those two fitted.",
    "Right age.",
    "Not\nknown to Miss Blacklog personally.",
    "If we wanted Pip and Emma  well\nthere they were.",
    "The Chief Constable nodded thoughtfully then he pushed across a\npaper to Craddock.",
    "Heres a little something weve dug up on Mrs. Easterbrook.",
    "The Inspector read with lifted eyebrows.",
    "Very interesting he remarked.",
    "Hoodwinked that old ass pretty well\nhasnt she It doesnt tie in with this business though as far as I can\nsee.",
    "Apparently not.",
    "And heres an item that concerns Mrs. Haymes.",
    "Again Craddocks eyebrows rose.",
    "I think Ill have another talk with the lady he said.",
    "You think this\ninformation might be relevant\n\nI think it might be.",
    "It would be a long shot of course...",
    "The two men were silent for a moment or two.",
    "How has Fletcher got on sir\n\nFletcher has been exceedingly active.",
    "Hes made a routine search of\nthe house by agreement with Miss Blacklog  but he didnt find anything\nsignificant.",
    "Then hes been checking up on who could have had the\nopportunity of oiling that door.",
    "Checking who was up at the house on\nthe days that that foreign girl was out.",
    "A little more complicated than\nwe thought because it appears she goes for a walk most afternoons.",
    "Usually down to the village where she has a cup of coffee at the\nBluebird.",
    "So that when Miss Blacklog and Miss Bunner are out  which\nis most afternoons  they go blackberrying  the coast is clear.",
    "And the doors are always left unlocked\n\nThey used to be.",
    "I dont suppose they are now.",
    "What are Fletchers results Whos known to have been in the house\nwhen it was left empty\n\nPractically the whole lot of them.",
    "Rydesdale consulted a page in front of him.",
    "Miss Murgatroyd was there with a hen to sit on some eggs.",
    "Sounds\ncomplicated but thats what she says.",
    "Very flustered about it all and\n\n\fcontradicts herself but Fletcher thinks thats temperamental and not a\nsign of guilt.",
    "Might be Craddock admitted.",
    "She flaps.",
    "Then Mrs. Swettenham came up to fetch some horse meat that Miss\nBlacklog had left for her on the kitchen table because Miss Blacklog\nhad been in to Milchester in the car that day and always gets Mrs.\nSwettenhams horse meat for her.",
    "That makes sense to you\n\nCraddock considered.",
    "Why didnt Miss Blacklog leave the horse meat when she passed Mrs.\nSwettenhams house on her way back from Milchester\n\nI dont know but she didnt.",
    "Mrs. Swettenham says she Miss B.\nalways leaves it on the kitchen table and she Mrs. S. likes to fetch it\nwhen Mitzi isnt there because Mitzi is sometimes so rude.",
    "Hangs together quite well.",
    "And the next\n\nMiss Hinchliffe.",
    "Says she wasnt there at all lately.",
    "But she was.",
    "Because Mitzi saw her coming out of the side door one day and so did a\nMrs.",
    "Butt shes one of the locals.",
    "Miss H. then admitted she might have\nbeen there but had forgotten.",
    "Cant remember what she went for.",
    "Says\nshe probably just dropped in.",
    "Thats rather odd.",
    "So was her manner apparently.",
    "Then theres Mrs. Easterbrook.",
    "She\nwas exercising the dear dogs out that way and she just popped in to\nsee if Miss Blacklog would lend her a knitting pattern but Miss Blacklog\nwasnt in.",
    "She says she waited a little.",
    "Just so.",
    "Might be snooping round.",
    "Or might be oiling a door.",
    "And the\nColonel\n\nWent there one day with a book on India that Miss Blacklog had\nexpressed a desire to read.",
    "Had she\n\nHer account is that she tried to get out of having to read it but it was\nno use.",
    "And thats fair enough sighed Craddock.",
    "If anyone is really\ndetermined to lend you a book you never can get out of it\n\nWe dont know if Edmund Swettenham was up there.",
    "Hes extremely\nvague.",
    "Said he did drop in occasionally on errands for his mother but\nthinks not lately.",
    "In fact its all inconclusive.",
    "Yes.",
    "Rydesdale said with a slight grin Miss Marple has also been active.",
    "Fletcher reports that she had morning coffee at the Bluebird.",
    "Shes\n\n\fbeen to sherry at Boulders and to tea at Little Paddocks.",

    "She may be able to tell us if Colonel Easterbrooks a pukka Colonel or\nnot.",
    "Shed know I agree  he seems all right.",
    "Wed have to check with the\nFar Eastern Authorities to get certain identification.",
    "And in the meantime   Craddock broke off  do you think Miss\nBlacklog would consent to go away\n\nGo away from Chipping Cleghorn\n\nYes.",
    "Take the faithful Bunner with her perhaps and leave for an\nunknown destination.",
    "Why shouldnt she go up to Scotland and stay\nwith Belle Goedler.",
    "Its a pretty ungetatable place.",
    "Stop there and wait for her to die I dont think shed do that.",
    "I dont\nthink any nicenatured woman would like that suggestion.",
    "If its a matter of saving her life \n\nCome now Craddock it isnt quite so easy to bump someone off as\nyou seem to think.",
    "Isnt it sir\n\n\fWell  in one way  its easy enough I agree.",
    "Plenty of methods.",
    "Weedkiller.",
    "A bash on the head when shes out shutting up the poultry a pot\nshot from behind a hedge.",
    "All quite simple.",
    "But to bump someone off\nand not be suspected of bumping them off  thats not quite so easy.",
    "And they must realise by now that theyre all under observation.",
    "The\noriginal carefully planned scheme failed.",
    "Our unknown murderer has\ngot to think up something else.",
    "I know that sir.",
    "But theres the time element to consider.",
    "Mrs.\nGoedlers a dying woman  she might pop off any minute.",
    "That means\nthat our murderer cant afford to wait.",
    "True.",
    "And another thing sir.",
    "He  or she  must know that were checking up\non everybody.",
    "And that takes time said Rydesdale with a sigh.",
    "It means checking\nwith the East with India.",
    "Yes its a long tedious business.",
    "So thats another reason for hurry.",
    "Im sure sir that the danger is very\nreal.",
    "Its a very large sum thats at stake.",
    "If Belle Goedler dies \n\nHe broke off as a constable entered.",

    "He put the receiver down.",
    "Is it  Craddock broke off.",
    "Rydesdale shook his head.",
    "No he said.",
    "Its Dora Bunner.",
    "She wanted some aspirin.",
    "Apparently\nshe took some from a bottle beside Letitia Blacklogs bed.",
    "There were\nonly a few tablets left in the bottle.",
    "She took two and left one.",
    "The\ndoctors got that one and is sending it to be analysed.",

    "Whilst waiting for Miss Blacklog Miss Marple looked round the drawingroom and wondered just exactly what Dora Bunner had meant that\nmorning in the Bluebird by saying that she believed Patrick had\n\n\ftampered with the lamp to make the lights go out.",
    "What lamp And\nhow had he tampered with it\n\nShe must Miss Marple decided have meant the small lamp that stood\non the table by the archway.",

    "What else was it that Dora Bunner had said I remember distinctly that\nit was the shepherdess.",
    "And the next day  Certainly it was a shepherd\nnow.",
    "Miss Marple remembered that when she and Bunch had come to tea\nDora Bunner had said something about the lamp being one of a pair.",
    "Of\ncourse  a shepherd and a shepherdess.",
    "And it had been the\nshepherdess on the day of the holdup  and the next morning it had\nbeen the other lamp  the lamp that was here now the shepherd.",
    "The\nlamps had been changed over during the night.",
    "And Dora Bunner had\nhad reason to believe or had believed without reason that it was\nPatrick who had changed them.",
    "Why Because if the original lamp were examined it would show just\nhow Patrick had managed to make the lights go out.",
    "How had he\nmanaged Miss Marple looked earnestly at the lamp in front of her.",
    "The\nflex ran along the table over the edge and was plugged into the wall.",
    "There was a small pearshaped switch halfway along the flex.",
    "None of it\n\n\fsuggested anything to Miss Marple because she knew very little about\nelectricity.",
    "Where was the shepherdess lamp she wondered.",
    "In the spare room\nor thrown away or  where was it Dora Bunner had come upon Patrick\nSimmons with a feather and an oily cup In the shrubbery Miss Marple\nmade up her mind to put all these points to Inspector Craddock.",
    "At the very beginning Miss Blacklog had leaped to the conclusion that\nher nephew Patrick had been behind the insertion of that advertisement.",
    "That kind of instinctive belief was often justified or so Miss Marple\nbelieved.",
    "Because if you knew people fairly well you knew the kind of\nthings they thought of...\n\nPatrick Simmons...\n\nA handsome young man.",
    "An engaging young man.",
    "A young man whom\nwomen liked both young women and old women.",

    "I dont think it was idle curiosity.",
    "Well perhaps youre right Miss Blacklog but my own diagnosis would\nbe a severe attack of Nosey Parkeritis...\n\n\fShes a very harmless old creature said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Dangerous\nas a rattlesnake if you only knew the Inspector thought grimly.",
    "But he\nhad no intention of taking anyone into his confidence unnecessarily.",

    "Ah.",
    "Can I have a look at it\n\nYes of course.",
    "Now where did I put that album\n\nTell me Miss Blacklog do you consider it remotely passible that Mrs.\nSwettenham might be Sonia Goedler\n\nMrs. Swettenham Miss Blacklog looked at him in lively astonishment.",
    "But her husband was in the Government Service  in India first I think\nand then in Hong Kong.",
    "What you mean is that thats the story shes told you.",
    "You dont as we\nsay in the Courts know it of your own knowledge do you\n\nNo said Miss Blacklog slowly.",
    "When you put it like that I dont...",
    "But\nMrs. Swettenham Oh its absurd\n\nDid Sonia Goedler ever do any acting Amateur theatricals\n\nOh yes.",
    "She was good.",
    "There you are Another thing Mrs. Swettenham wears a wig.",

    "Then theres Miss Hinchliffe and Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "Could either of them\nbe Sonia Goedler\n\nMiss Hinchliffe is too tall.",
    "Shes as tall as a man.",
    "Miss Murgatroyd then\n\nOh but  oh no Im sure Miss Murgatroyd couldnt be Sonia.",
    "You dont see very well do you Miss Blacklog\n\n\fIm shortsighted is that what you mean\n\nYes.",
    "What Id like to see is a snapshot of this Sonia Goedler even if its\na long time ago and not a good likeness.",
    "Were trained you know to\npick out resemblances in a way no amateur can ever do.",
    "Ill try and find it for you.",

    "Oh so thats where we put them.",
    "I couldnt remember.",

    "Were there Julia\n\nI didnt look very closely  only at some of the dresses.",
    "But no... youre\nright Aunt Letty there werent any blank spaces.",
    "Craddock looked grimmer still.",
    "Somebody he said has removed every photo of Sonia Goedler from\nthis album.",
    "Chapter 18 THE LETTERS\n\nSorry to worry you again Mrs. Haymes.",
    "It doesnt matter said Phillipa coldly.",
    "Shall we go into this room\nhere\n\nThe study Yes if you like Inspector.",
    "Its very cold.",
    "Theres no fire.",
    "It doesnt matter.",
    "Its not for long.",
    "And were not so likely to be\noverheard here.",
    "Does that matter\n\nNot to me Mrs. Haymes.",
    "It might to you.",
    "What do you mean\n\n\fI think you told me Mrs. Haymes that your husband was killed fighting\nin Italy\n\nWell\n\nWouldnt it have been simpler to have told me the truth  that he was a\ndeserter from his regiment.",
    "He saw her face grow white and her hands close and unclose\nthemselves.",
    "She said bitterly Do you have to rake up everything\n\nCraddock said dryly We expect people to tell us the truth about\nthemselves.",
    "She was silent.",
    "Then she said Well\n\nWhat do you mean by Well Mrs. Haymes\n\nI mean what are you going to do about it Tell everybody Is that\nnecessary  or fair  or kind\n\nDoes nobody know\n\nNobody here.",
    "Harry  her voice changed  my son he doesnt know.",
    "I\ndont want him to know.",
    "I dont want him to know  ever.",
    "Then let me tell you that youre taking a very big risk Mrs. Haymes.",
    "When the boy is old enough to understand tell him the truth.",
    "If he finds\nout by himself some day  it wont be good for him.",
    "If you go on stuffing\nhim up with tales of his father dying like a hero \n\nI dont do that.",
    "Im not completely dishonest.",
    "I just dont talk about it.",
    "His father was  killed in the war.",
    "After all thats what it amounts to  for\nus.",
    "But your husband is still alive\n\nPerhaps.",
    "How should I know\n\nWhen did you see him last Mrs. Haymes\n\nPhillipa said quickly I havent seen him for years.",
    "Are you quite sure thats true You didnt for instance see him about a\nfortnight ago\n\nWhat are you suggesting\n\nIt never seemed to me very likely that you met Rudi Scherz in the\nsummerhouse here.",
    "But Mitzis story was very emphatic.",
    "I suggest Mrs.\nHaymes that the man you came back from work to meet that morning\nwas your husband.",
    "I didnt meet anybody in the summerhouse.",
    "He was hard up for money perhaps and you supplied him with\nsome\n\nIve not seen him I tell you.",
    "I didnt meet anybody in the\nsummerhouse.",
    "Deserters are often rather desperate men.",

    "I dont know where my husband is.",
    "I havent seen him for years.",
    "Is that your last word Mrs. Haymes\n\nIve nothing else to say.",
    "II\n\nCraddock came away from his interview with Phillipa Haymes feeling\nangry and baffled.",
    "Obstinate as a mule he said to himself angrily.",
    "He was fairly sure that\nPhillipa was lying but he hadnt succeeded in breaking down her\nobstinate denials.",
    "He wished he knew a little more about exCaptain Haymes.",
    "His\ninformation was meagre.",
    "An unsatisfactory Army record but nothing to\nsuggest that Haymes was likely to turn criminal.",
    "And anyway Haymes didnt fit in with the oiled door.",
    "Someone in the house had done that or someone with easy access to it.",
    "He stood looking up the staircase and suddenly he wondered what\nJulia had been doing up in the attic.",
    "An attic he thought was an\nunlikely place for the fastidious Julia to visit.",
    "What had she been doing up there\n\nHe ran lightly up to the first floor.",
    "There was no one about.",
    "He opened\nthe door out of which Julia had come and went up the narrow stairs to\nthe attic.",
    "There were trunks there old suitcases various broken articles of\nfurniture a chair with a leg off a broken china lamp part of an old\ndinner service.",
    "He turned to the trunks and opened the lid of one.",
    "Clothes.",

    "He picked up another.",
    "Darling Charlotte\n\nI wish you would sometimes make up your mind to see people.",
    "You do\nexaggerate you know.",
    "It isnt nearly as bad as you think.",
    "And people\nreally dont mind things like that.",
    "Its not the disfigurement you think it is.",
    "He nodded his head.",
    "He remembered Belle Goedler saying that\nCharlotte Blacklog had a disfigurement or deformity of some kind.",
    "Letitia had in the end resigned her job to go and look after her sister.",
    "These letters all breathed the anxious spirit of her affection and love for\nan invalid.",
    "She had written her sister apparently long accounts of\n\n\feveryday happenings of any little detail that she thought might interest\nthe sick girl.",
    "And Charlotte had kept these letters.",
    "Occasionally odd\nsnapshots had been enclosed.",
    "Excitement suddenly flooded Craddocks mind.",
    "Here it might be he\nwould find a clue.",
    "In these letters there would be written down things\nthat Letitia Blacklog herself had long forgotten.",
    "Here was a faithful\npicture of the past and somewhere amongst it there might be a clue\nthat would help him to identify the unknown.",
    "Photographs too.",
    "There might just possibly be a photograph of Sonia\nGoedler here that the person who had taken the other photos out of the\nalbum did not know about.",
    "Inspector Craddock packed the letters up again carefully closed the\ncase and started down the stairs.",
    "Letitia Blacklog standing on the\nlanding below looked at him in amazement.",
    "Was that you up in the attic I heard footsteps.",
    "I couldnt imagine who \n\nMiss Blacklog I have found some letters here written by you to your\nsister Charlotte many years ago.",
    "Will you allow me to take them away\nand read them\n\nShe flushed angrily.",
    "Must you do a thing like that Why What good can they be to you\n\n\fThey might give me a picture of Sonia Goedler of her character  there\nmay be some allusion  some incident  that will help.",
    "They are private letters Inspector.",
    "I know.",
    "I suppose you will take them anyway... You have the power to do so I\nsuppose or you can easily get it.",
    "Take them  take them But youll find\nvery little about Sonia.",
    "She married and went away only a year or two\nafter I began to work for Randall Goedler.",
    "Craddock said obstinately There may be something  He added\nWeve got to try everything.",
    "I assure you the danger is very real.",
    "She said biting her lips I know.",
    "Bunny is dead  from taking an aspirin\ntablet that was meant for me.",
    "It may be Patrick or Julia or Phillipa or\nMitzi next  somebody young with their life in front of them.",
    "Somebody\nwho drinks a glass of wine that is poured out for me or eats a chocolate\nthat is sent to me.",
    "Oh take the letters  take them away.",
    "And afterwards\nburn them.",
    "They dont mean anything to anyone but me and Charlotte.",
    "Its all over  gone  past.",
    "Nobody remembers now...",
    "Her hand went up to the choker of false pearls she was wearing.",
    "Craddock thought how incongruous it looked with her tweed coat and\nskirt.",
    "She said again Take the letters.",
    "III\n\nIt was the following afternoon that the Inspector called at the Vicarage.",
    "It was a dark gusty day... Miss Marple had her chair pulled close to the\nfire and was knitting.",
    "Bunch was on hands and knees crawling about\nthe floor cutting out material to a pattern.",
    "She sat back and pushed a mop of hair out of her eyes looking up\nexpectantly at Craddock.",
    "I dont know if its a breach of confidence said the Inspector\naddressing himself to Miss Marple but Id like you to look at this\nletter.",
    "He explained the circumstances of his discovery in the attic.",
    "Its rather a touching collection of letters he said.",
    "Miss Blacklog\npoured out everything in the hopes of sustaining her sisters interest in\nlife and keeping her health good.",
    "Theres a very clear picture of an old\nfather in the background  old Dr. Blacklog.",
    "A real old pigheaded bully\nabsolutely set in his ways and convinced that everything he thought\nand said was right.",
    "Probably killed thousands of patients through\nobstinacy.",
    "He wouldnt stand for any new ideas or methods.",
    "I dont really know that I blame him there said Miss Marple.",
    "I always\nfeel that the young doctors are only too anxious to experiment.",
    "After\ntheyve whipped out all our teeth and administered quantities of very\npeculiar glands and removed bits of our insides they then confess that\n\n\fnothing can be done for us.",
    "I really prefer the oldfashioned remedy of\nbig black bottles of medicine.",
    "After all one can always pour those down\nthe sink.",
    "She took the letter that Craddock handed her.",
    "He said I want you to read it because I think that that generation is\nmore easily understood by you than by me.",
    "I dont know really quite\nhow these peoples minds worked.",
    "Miss Marple unfolded the fragile paper.",
    "Dearest Charlotte\n\nIve not written for two days because weve been having the most\nterrible domestic complications.",
    "Randalls sister Sonia you remember\nher She came to take you out in the car that day How I wish you\nwould go out more Sonia has declared her intention of marrying one\nDmitri Stamfordis.",
    "I have only seen him once.",
    "Very attractive  not to be\ntrusted I should say.",
    "R.G.",
    "raves against him and says he is a crook and\na swindler.",
    "Belle bless her just smiles and lies on her sofa.",
    "Sonia who\nthough she looks so impassive has really a terrific temper is simply\nwild with R.G.",
    "I really thought yesterday she was going to murder him\n\nIve done my best.",
    "Ive talked to Sonia and Ive talked to R.G.",
    "and Ive\ngot them both into a more reasonable frame of mind and then they\ncome together and it all starts over again Youve no idea how tiring it is.",
    "R.G.",
    "has been making enquiries  and it does really seem as though this\nStamfordis man was thoroughly undesirable.",
    "In the meantime business is being neglected.",
    "I carry on at the office and\nin a way its rather fun because R.G.",
    "gives me a free hand.",
    "He said to\nme yesterday Thank Heaven theres one sane person in the world.",
    "Youre never likely to fall in love with a crook Blackie are you I said I\ndidnt think I was likely to fall in love with anybody.",
    "R.G.",
    "said Lets\nstart a few new hares in the City.",
    "Hes really rather a mischievous devil\nsometimes and he sails terribly near the wind.",
    "Youre quite determined\nto keep me on the straight and narrow path arent you Blackie he\nsaid the other day.",
    "And I shall too I cant understand how people cant\nsee when a things dishonest  but R.G.",
    "really and truly doesnt.",
    "He only\nknows what is actually against the law.",
    "Belle only laughs at all this.",
    "She thinks the fuss about Sonia is all\nnonsense.",
    "Sonia has her own money she said.",
    "Why shouldnt she\nmarry this man if she wants to I said it might turn out to be a terrible\nmistake and Belle said Its never a mistake to marry a man you want to\nmarry  even if you regret it.",
    "And then she said I suppose Sonia\ndoesnt want to break with Randall because of money.",
    "Sonias very fond\nof money.",
    "No more now.",
    "How is father I wont say Give him my love.",
    "But you can\nif you think its better to do so.",
    "Have you seen more people You really\nmust not be morbid darling.",
    "Sonia asks to be remembered to you.",
    "She has just come in and is\nclosing and unclosing her hands like an angry cat sharpening its claws.",
    "I think she and R.G.",
    "have had another row.",
    "Of course Sonia can be very\nirritating.",
    "She stares you down with that cool stare of hers.",
    "Lots of love darling and buck up.",
    "This iodine treatment may make a lot\nof difference.",
    "Ive been inquiring about it and it really does seem to\nhave good results.",
    "Your loving sister\n\nLetitia\n\nMiss Marple folded the letter and handed it back.",
    "She looked\nabstracted.",
    "Well what do you think about her Craddock urged.",
    "What picture do\nyou get of her\n\nOf Sonia Its difficult you know to see anyone through another\npersons mind...",
    "Determined to get her own way  that definitely I think.",
    "And wanting the best of two worlds...",
    "Closing and unclosing her hands like an angry cat murmured\nCraddock.",
    "You know that reminds me of someone...",
    "He frowned.",
    "Making inquiries... murmured Miss Marple.",
    "If we could get hold of the result of those inquiries said Craddock.",
    "Does that letter remind you of anything in St. Mary Mead asked\nBunch rather indistinctly since her mouth was full of pins.",
    "I really cant say it does dear... Dr. Blacklog is perhaps a little like Mr.\nCurtiss the Wesleyan Minister.",
    "He wouldnt let his child wear a plate on\nher teeth.",
    "Said it was the Lords Will if her teeth stuck out.",
    "After all I\nsaid to him you do trim your beard and cut your hair.",
    "It might be the\nLords Will that your hair should grow out.",
    "He said that was quite\ndifferent.",
    "So like a man.",
    "But that doesnt help us with our present\nproblem.",
    "Weve never traced that revolver you know.",
    "It wasnt Rudi Scherzs.",
    "If\nI knew who had had a revolver in Chipping Cleghorn \n\nColonel Easterbrook has one said Bunch.",
    "He keeps it in his collar\ndrawer.",
    "How do you know Mrs. Harmon\n\nMrs.",
    "Butt told me.",
    "Shes my daily.",
    "Or rather my twice weekly.",
    "Being a\nmilitary gentleman she said hed naturally have a revolver and very\nhandy it would be if burglars were to come along.",
    "When did she tell you this\n\nAges ago.",
    "About six months ago I should think.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook murmured Craddock.",
    "Its like those pointer things at fairs isnt it said Bunch still speaking\nthrough a mouthful of pins.",
    "Go round and round and stop at something\ndifferent every time.",
    "Youre telling me said Craddock and groaned.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook was up at Little Paddocks to leave a book there\none day.",
    "He could have oiled that door then.",
    "He was quite\nstraightforward about being there though.",
    "Not like Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "Miss Marple coughed gently.",
    "You must make allowances for the times\nwe live in Inspector she said.",
    "Craddock looked at her uncomprehendingly.",
    "After all said Miss Marple you are the Police arent you People\ncant say everything theyd like to say to the Police can they\n\nI dont see why not said Craddock.",
    "Unless theyve got some criminal\nmatter to conceal.",
    "She means butter said Bunch crawling actively round a table leg to\nanchor a floating bit of paper.",
    "Butter and corn for hens and sometimes cream  and sometimes even\na side of bacon.",
    "Show him that note from Miss Blacklog said Miss Marple.",
    "Its some\ntime ago now but it reads like a firstclass mystery story.",
    "What have I done with it.",
    "Is this the one you mean Aunt Jane\n\nMiss Marple took it and looked at it.",
    "Yes she said with satisfaction.",
    "Thats the one.",
    "She handed it to the Inspector.",
    "I have made inquiries  Thursday is the day Miss Blacklog had written.",
    "Any time after three.",
    "If there is any for me leave it in the usual place.",
    "Bunch spat out her pins and laughed.",
    "Miss Marple was watching the\nInspectors face.",
    "The Vicars wife took it upon herself to explain.",
    "Thursday is the day one of the farms round here makes butter.",
    "They let\nanybody they like have a bit.",
    "Its usually Miss Hinchliffe who collects it.",
    "Shes very much in with all the farmers  because of her pigs I think.",
    "But its all a bit hushhush you know a kind of local scheme of barter.",
    "One person gets butter and sends along cucumbers or something like\nthat  and a little something when a pigs killed.",
    "And now and then an\nanimal has an accident and has to be destroyed.",
    "Oh you know the sort\nof thing.",
    "Only one cant very well say it right out to the Police.",
    "Because\nI suppose quite a lot of this barter is illegal  only nobody really knows\nbecause its all so complicated.",
    "But I expect Hinch had slipped into\nLittle Paddocks with a pound of butter or something and had put it in\n\n\fthe usual place.",
    "Thats a flour bin under the dresser by the way.",
    "It\ndoesnt have flour in it.",
    "Craddock sighed.",
    "Im glad I came here to you ladies he said.",
    "There used to be clothing coupons too said Bunch.",
    "Not usually\nbought  that wasnt considered honest.",
    "No money passes.",
    "But people\nlike Mrs.",
    "Butt or Mrs. Finch or Mrs. Huggins like a nice woollen dress or\na winter coat that hasnt seen too much wear and they pay for it with\ncoupons instead of money.",
    "Youd better not tell me any more said Craddock.",
    "Its all against the\nlaw.",
    "Then there oughtnt to be such silly laws said Bunch filling her\nmouth up with pins again.",
    "I dont do it of course because Julian\ndoesnt like me to so I dont.",
    "But I know whats going on of course.",
    "A kind of despair was coming over the Inspector.",
    "It all sounds so pleasant and ordinary he said.",
    "Funny and petty and\nsimple.",
    "And yet one woman and a man have been killed and another\nwoman may be killed before I can get anything definite to go on.",
    "Ive left\noff worrying about Pip and Emma for the moment.",
    "Im concentrating on\nSonia.",
    "I wish I knew what she looked like.",
    "There was a snapshot or two\nin with these letters but none of the snaps could have been of her.",
    "How do you know it couldnt have been her Do you know what she\nlooked like\n\nShe was small and dark Miss Blacklog said.",
    "Really said Miss Marple thats very interesting.",
    "There was one snap that reminded me vaguely of someone.",
    "A tall fair\ngirl with her hair all done up on top of her head.",
    "I dont know who she\ncould have been.",
    "Anyway it cant have been Sonia.",
    "Do you think Mrs.\nSwettenham could have been dark when she was a girl\n\nNot very dark said Bunch.",
    "Shes got blue eyes.",
    "I hoped there might be a photo of Dmitri Stamfordis  but I suppose\nthat was too much to hope for...  he took up the letter  Im sorry this\ndoesnt suggest anything to you Miss Marple.",
    "Oh but it does said Miss Marple.",
    "It suggests a good deal.",
    "Just read\nit through again Inspector  especially where it says that Randall\nGoedler was making inquiries about Dmitri Stamfordis.",
    "Craddock stared at her.",
    "The telephone rang.",
    "Bunch got up from the floor and went out into the hall where in\naccordance with the best Victorian traditions the telephone had\noriginally been placed and where it still was.",
    "She reentered the room to say to Craddock Its for you.",
    "Slightly surprised the Inspector went out to the instrument  carefully\nshutting the door of the livingroom behind him.",
    "Craddock Rydesdale here.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Ive been looking through your report.",
    "In the interview you had with\nPhillipa Haymes I see she states positively that she hasnt seen her\nhusband since his desertion from the Army\n\nThats right sir  she was most emphatic.",
    "But in my opinion she wasnt\nspeaking the truth.",
    "I agree with you.",
    "Do you remember a case about ten days ago  man\nrun over by a lorry  taken to Milchester General with concussion and a\nfractured pelvis\n\nThe fellow who snatched a child practically from under the wheels of a\nlorry and got run down himself\n\nThats the one.",
    "No papers of any kind on him and nobody came\nforward to identify him.",
    "Looked as though he might be on the run.",
    "He\ndied last night without regaining consciousness.",
    "But hes been\nidentified  deserter from the Army  Ronald Haymes exCaptain in the\nSouth Loamshires.",
    "Phillipa Haymes husband\n\nYes.",
    "Hed got an old Chipping Cleghorn bus ticket on him by the way and quite a reasonable amount of money.",
    "So he did get money from his wife I always thought he was the man\nMitzi overheard talking to her in the summerhouse.",
    "She denied it flatly\nof course.",
    "But surely sir that lorry accident was before \n\nRydesdale took the words out of his mouth.",
    "Yes he was taken to Milchester General on the 28th.",
    "The holdup at\nLittle Paddocks was on the 29th.",
    "That lets him out of any possible\nconnection with it.",
    "But his wife of course knew nothing about the\naccident.",
    "She may have been thinking all along that he was concerned\nin it.",
    "Shed hold her tongue  naturally  after all he was her husband.",
    "It was a fairly gallant bit of work wasnt it sir said Craddock slowly.",
    "Rescuing that child from the lorry Yes.",
    "Plucky.",
    "Dont suppose it was\ncowardice that made Haymes desert.",
    "Well all thats past history.",
    "For a\nman whod blotted his copybook it was a good death.",
    "Im glad for her sake said the Inspector.",
    "And for that boy of theirs.",
    "Yes he neednt be too ashamed of his father.",
    "And the young woman\nwill be able to marry again now.",
    "Craddock said slowly\n\nI was thinking of that sir...",
    "It opens up  possibilities.",
    "Since youre there its best to give her the news.",
    "Yes Sir.",
    "Ill look her up now.",
    "Or maybe better to wait till she gets home.",
    "She may get a shock...\n\nChapter 19 RECONSTITUTION OF THE CRIME\n\nIll put on a lamp by you before I go said Bunch.",
    "Its so dark in here.",
    "Theres going to be a storm I think.",
    "She lifted the small reading lamp to the other side of the table where it\nwould throw light on Miss Marples knitting as she sat in a wide highbacked chair.",
    "As the flex pulled across the table Tiglath Pileser the cat leapt upon it\nand bit and clawed it violently.",
    "No Tiglath Pileser you mustnt...",
    "He really is awful.",
    "Look hes nearly\nbitten it through  its all frayed.",
    "Dont you understand you idiotic puss\nthat you may get a nasty electric shock if you do that\n\nThank you dear said Miss Marple and put out a hand to turn on the\nlamp.",
    "It doesnt turn on there.",
    "You have to press that silly little switch halfway along the flex.",
    "Wait a minute.",
    "Ill take these flowers out of the way.",
    "She lifted a bowl of Christmas roses across the table.",
    "Tiglath Pileser\nhis tail switching put out a mischievous paw and clawed Bunchs arm.",
    "She spilled some of the water out of the vase.",
    "It fell on the frayed area\nof flex and on Tiglath Pileser himself who leapt to the floor with an\nindignant hiss.",
    "Miss Marple pressed the small pearshaped switch.",
    "Where the water\nhad soaked the frayed flex there was a flash and a crackle.",
    "Oh dear said Bunch.",
    "Its fused.",
    "Now I suppose all the lights in here\nare off.",
    "She tried them.",
    "Yes they are.",
    "So stupid being all on the same\nthingummibob.",
    "And its made a burn on the table too.",
    "Naughty Tiglath\nPileser  its all his fault.",
    "Aunt Jane  whats the matter Did it startle\nyou\n\nIts nothing dear.",
    "Just something I saw quite suddenly which I ought to\nhave seen before...\n\nIll go and fix the fuse and get the lamp from Julians study.",
    "No dear dont bother.",
    "Youll miss your bus.",
    "I dont want any more light.",
    "I just want to sit quietly and  think about something.",
    "Hurry dear or you\nwont catch your bus.",
    "When Bunch had gone Miss Marple sat quite still for about two minutes.",
    "The air of the room was heavy and menacing with the gathering storm\noutside.",
    "Miss Marple drew a sheet of paper towards her.",
    "She wrote first Lamp and underlined it heavily.",
    "After a moment or two\nshe wrote another word.",
    "Her pencil travelled down the paper making\nbrief cryptic notes...\n\nII\n\nIn the rather dark livingroom of Boulders with its low ceiling and\nlatticed window panes Miss Hinchliffe and Miss Murgatroyd were\nhaving an argument.",
    "The trouble with you Murgatroyd said Miss Hinchliffe is that you\nwont try.",
    "But I tell you Hinch I cant remember a thing.",
    "Now look here Amy Murgatroyd were going to do some constructive\nthinking.",
    "So far we havent shone on the detective angle.",
    "I was quite\nwrong over that door business.",
    "You didnt hold the door open for the\nmurderer after all.",
    "Youre cleared Murgatroyd\n\nMiss Murgatroyd gave a rather watery smile.",
    "Its just our luck to have the only silent cleaning woman in Chipping\nCleghorn continued Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "Usually Im thankful for it but\nthis time it means weve got off to a bad start.",
    "Everybody else in the\n\n\fplace knows about that second door in the drawingroom being used and we only heard about it yesterday \n\nI still dont quite understand how \n\nIts perfectly simple.",
    "Our original premises were quite right.",
    "You cant\nhold open a door wave a torch and shoot with a revolver all at the same\ntime.",
    "We kept in the revolver and the torch and cut out the door.",
    "Well\nwe were wrong.",
    "It was the revolver we ought to have cut out.",
    "But he did have a revolver said Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "I saw it.",
    "It was\nthere on the floor beside him.",
    "When he was dead yes.",
    "Its all quite clear.",
    "He didnt fire that revolver \n\nThen who did\n\nThats what were going to find out.",
    "But whoever did it the same\nperson put a couple of poisoned aspirin tablets by Letty Blacklogs bed\n and thereby bumped off poor Dora Bunner.",
    "And that couldnt have\nbeen Rudi Scherz because hes as dead as a doornail.",
    "It was someone\nwho was in the room that night of the holdup and probably someone\nwho was at the birthday party too.",
    "And the only person that lets out is\nMrs. Harmon.",
    "You think someone put those aspirins there the day of the birthday\nparty\n\n\fWhy not\n\nBut how could they\n\nWell we all went to the loo didnt we said Miss Hinchliffe coarsely.",
    "And I washed my hands in the bathroom because of that sticky cake.",
    "And little Sweetie Easterbrook powdered her grubby little face in\nBlacklogs bedroom didnt she\n\nHinch Do you think she \n\nI dont know yet.",
    "Rather obvious if she did.",
    "I dont think if you were\ngoing to plant some tablets that youd want to be seen in the bedroom\nat all.",
    "Oh yes there were plenty of opportunities.",
    "The men didnt go upstairs.",
    "There are back stairs.",
    "After all if a man leaves the room you dont\nfollow him to see if he really is going where you think he is going.",
    "It\nwouldnt be delicate Anyway dont argue Murgatroyd.",
    "I want to get\nback to the original attempt on Letty Blacklog.",
    "Now to begin with get\nthe facts firmly into your head because its all going to depend upon\nyou.",
    "Miss Murgatroyd looked alarmed.",
    "Oh dear Hinch you know what a muddle I get into\n\n\fIts not a question of your brains or the grey fluff that passes for\nbrains with you.",
    "Its a question of eyes.",
    "Its a question of what you saw.",
    "But I didnt see anything.",
    "The trouble with you is Murgatroyd as I said just now that you wont\ntry.",
    "Now pay attention.",
    "This is what happened.",
    "Whoever it is thats got it\nin for Letty Blacklog was there in that room that evening.",
    "He I say he\nbecause its easier but theres no reason why it should be a man more\nthan a woman except of course that men are dirty dogs well he has\npreviously oiled that second door that leads out of the drawingroom\nand which is supposed to be nailed up or something.",
    "Dont ask me when\nhe did it because that confuses things.",
    "Actually by choosing my time I\ncould walk into any house in Chipping Cleghorn and do anything I liked\nthere for half an hour or so with no one being the wiser.",
    "Its just a\nquestion of working out where the daily women are and when the\noccupiers are out and exactly where theyve gone and how long theyll\nbe.",
    "Just good staff work.",
    "Now to continue.",
    "Hes oiled that second door.",
    "It will open without a sound.",
    "Heres the setup Lights go out door A\nthe regular door opens with a flourish.",
    "Business with torch and holdup lines.",
    "In the meantime while were all goggling X thats the best\nterm to use slips quietly out by door B into the dark hall comes up\nbehind that Swiss idiot takes a couple of shots at Letty Blacklog and\nthen shoots the Swiss.",
    "Drops the revolver where lazy thinkers like you\nwill assume its evidence that the Swiss did the shooting and nips back\ninto the room again by the time that someone gets a lighter going.",
    "Got\nit\n\nYes  yees but who was it\n\n\fWell if you dont know Murgatroyd nobody does\n\nMe Miss Murgatroyd fairly twittered in alarm.",
    "But I dont know\nanything at all.",
    "I dont really Hinch\n\nUse that fluff of yours you call a brain.",
    "To begin with where was\neverybody when the lights went out\n\nI dont know.",
    "Yes you do.",
    "Youre maddening Murgatroyd.",
    "You know where you\nwere dont you You were behind the door.",
    "Yes  yes I was.",
    "It knocked against my corn when it flew open.",
    "Why dont you go to a proper chiropodist instead of messing about\nyourself with your feet.",
    "Youll give yourself blood poisoning one of these\ndays.",
    "Come on now  youre behind the door.",
    "Im standing against the\nmantelpiece with my tongue hanging out for a drink.",
    "Letty Blacklog is\nby the table near the archway getting the cigarettes.",
    "Patrick Simmons\nhas gone through the archway into the small room where Letty Blacklog\nhas had the drinks put.",
    "Agreed\n\nYes yes I remember all that.",
    "Good now somebody else followed Patrick into that room or was just\nstarting to follow him.",
    "One of the men.",
    "The annoying thing is that I cant\n\n\fremember whether it was Easterbrook or Edmund Swettenham.",
    "Do you\nremember\n\nNo I dont.",
    "You wouldnt And there was someone else who went through to the\nsmall room Phillipa Haymes.",
    "I remember that distinctly because I\nremember noticing what a nice flat back she has and I thought to\nmyself that girl would look well on a horse.",
    "I was watching her and\nthinking just that.",
    "She went over to the mantelpiece in the other room.",
    "I\ndont know what it was she wanted there because at that moment the\nlights went out.",
    "So thats the position.",
    "In the far drawingroom are Patrick Simmons\nPhillipa\n\nHaymes\n\nand\n\neither\n\nColonel\n\nEasterbrook\n\nor\n\nEdmund\n\nSwettenham  we dont know which.",
    "Now Murgatroyd pay attention.",
    "The most probable thing is that it was one of those three who did it.",
    "If\nanyone wanted to get out of that far door theyd naturally take care to\nput themselves in a convenient place when the lights went out.",
    "So as I\nsay in all probability its one of those three.",
    "And in that case\nMurgatroyd theres not a thing you can do about it\n\nMiss Murgatroyd brightened perceptibly.",
    "On the other hand continued Miss Hinchliffe theres the possibility\nthat it wasnt one of those three.",
    "And thats where you come in\nMurgatroyd.",
    "But how should I know anything about it\n\n\fAs I said before if you dont nobody does.",
    "But I dont I really dont I couldnt see anything at all\n\nOh yes you could.",
    "Youre the only person who could see.",
    "You were\nstanding behind the door.",
    "You couldnt look at the torch  because the\ndoor was between you and it.",
    "You were facing the other way the same\nway as the torch was pointing.",
    "The rest of us were just dazzled.",
    "But you\nwerent dazzled.",
    "No  no perhaps not but I didnt see anything the torch went round\nand round \n\nShowing you what It rested on faces didnt it And on tables And on\nchairs\n\nYes  yes it did... Miss Bunner her mouth wide open and her eyes\npopping out of her head staring and blinking.",
    "Thats the stuff Miss Hinchliffe gave a sigh of relief.",
    "The difficulty\nthere is in making you use that grey fluff of yours Now then keep it\nup.",
    "But I didnt see any more I didnt really.",
    "You mean you saw an empty room Nobody standing about Nobody\nsitting down\n\n\fNo of course not that.",
    "Miss Bunner with her mouth open and Mrs.\nHarmon was sitting on the arm of a chair.",
    "She had her eyes tight shut\nand her knuckles all doubled up to her face  like a child.",
    "Good thats Mrs. Harmon and Miss Bunner.",
    "Dont you see yet what Im\ngetting at The difficulty is that I dont want to put ideas into your head.",
    "But when weve eliminated who you did see  we can get on to the\nimportant point which is was there anyone you didnt see.",
    "Got it\nBesides the tables and the chairs and the chrysanthemums and the rest\nof it there were certain people Julia Simmons Mrs. Swettenham Mrs.\nEasterbrook  either Colonel Easterbrook or Edmund Swettenham Dora Bunner and Bunch Harmon.",
    "All right you saw Bunch Harmon and\nDora Bunner.",
    "Cross them off.",
    "Now think Murgatroyd think was there\none of those people who definitely wasnt there\n\nMiss Murgatroyd jumped slightly as a branch knocked against the open\nwindow.",
    "She shut her eyes.",
    "She murmured to herself...",
    "The flowers... on the table... the big armchair... the torch didnt come\nround as far as you Hinch  Mrs. Harmon yes...",
    "The telephone rang sharply.",
    "Miss Hinchliffe went to it.",
    "Hallo yes The station\n\nThe obedient Miss Murgatroyd her eyes closed was reliving the night\nof the 29th.",
    "The torch sweeping slowly round... a group of people... the\nwindows... the sofa... Dora Bunner... the wall... the table with lamp...\nthe archway... the sudden spat of the revolver...\n\n\f... but thats extraordinary said Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "What Miss Hinchliffe was barking angrily into the telephone.",
    "Been\nthere since this morning What time Damn and blast you and you only\nring me up now Ill set the S.P.C.A.",
    "after you.",
    "An oversight Is that all\nyouve got to say\n\nShe banged down the receiver.",
    "Its that dog she said.",
    "The red setter.",
    "Been at the station since this\nmorning  since this morning at eight oclock Without a drop of water\nAnd the idiots only ring me up now.",
    "Im going to get her right away.",
    "She plunged out of the room Miss Murgatroyd squeaking shrilly in her\nwake.",
    "But listen Hinch a most extraordinary thing...",
    "I dont understand it...\n\nMiss Hinchliffe had dashed out of the door and across to the shed which\nserved as a garage.",
    "Well go on with it when I come back she called.",
    "I cant wait for you\nto come with me.",
    "Youve got your bedroom slippers on as usual.",
    "She pressed the starter of the car and backed out of the garage with a\njerk.",
    "Miss Murgatroyd skipped nimbly sideways.",
    "But listen Hinch I must tell you \n\n\fWhen I come back...",
    "The car jerked and shot forwards.",
    "Miss Murgatroyds voice came faintly\nafter it on a high excited note.",
    "But Hinch she wasnt there...\n\nIII\n\nOverhead the clouds had been gathering thick and blue.",
    "As Miss\nMurgatroyd stood looking after the retreating car the first big drops\nbegan to fall.",
    "In an agitated fashion Miss Murgatroyd plunged across to a line of\nstring on which she had some hours previously hung out a couple of\njumpers and a pair of woollen combinations to dry.",
    "She was murmuring under her breath Really most extraordinary... Oh\ndear I shall never get these down in time... And they were nearly dry...\n\nShe struggled with a recalcitrant clothes peg then turned her head as\nshe heard someone approaching.",
    "Then she smiled a pleased welcome.",
    "Hallo  do go inside youll get wet.",
    "Let me help you.",
    "Oh if you dont mind... so annoying if they all get soaked again.",
    "I really\nought to let down the line but I think I can just reach.",
    "Heres your scarf.",
    "Shall I put it round your neck\n\nOh thank you...",
    "Yes perhaps...",
    "If I could just reach this peg...",
    "The woollen scarf was slipped round her neck and then suddenly\npulled tight...\n\nMiss Murgatroyds mouth opened but no sound came except a small\nchoking gurgle.",
    "And the scarf was pulled tighter still...\n\nIV\n\nOn her way back from the station.",
    "Miss Hinchliffe stopped the car to\npick up Miss Marple who was hurrying along the street.",
    "Hallo she shouted.",
    "Youll get very wet.",
    "Come and have tea with us.",
    "I\nsaw Bunch waiting for the bus.",
    "Youll be all alone at the Vicarage.",
    "Come\nand join us.",
    "Murgatroyd and I are doing a bit of reconstruction of the\ncrime.",
    "I rather think were just getting somewhere.",
    "Mind the dog.",
    "Shes\nrather nervous.",
    "What a beauty.",
    "Yes lovely bitch isnt she Those fools kept her at the station since\nthis morning without letting me know.",
    "I told them off the lazy beasts.",
    "Oh excuse my language.",
    "I was brought up by grooms at home in\nIreland.",
    "The little car turned with a jerk into the small backyard of Boulders.",
    "A crowd of eager dudes and fowls encircled the two ladies as they\ndescended.",
    "Curse Murgatroyd said Miss Hinchliffe  she hasnt given em their\ncorn.",
    "Is it difficult to get corn Miss Marple inquired.",
    "Miss Hinchliffe winked.",
    "Im in with most of the farmers she said.",
    "Shooing away the hens she escorted Miss Marple towards the cottage.",
    "Hope youre not too wet\n\nNo this is a very good mackintosh.",
    "Ill light the fire if Murgatroyd hasnt lit it.",
    "Hiyah Murgatroyd Where is\nthe woman Murgatroyd Wheres that dog Shes disappeared now.",
    "A slow dismal howl came from outside.",
    "Curse the silly bitch.",
    "Miss Hinchliffe tramped to the door and called\nHyou Cutie  Cutie.",
    "Damn silly name but thats what they called her\napparently.",
    "We must find her another name.",
    "Hiyah Cutie.",
    "The red setter was sniffing at something lying below the taut string\nwhere a row of garments swirled in the wind.",
    "Murgatroyds not even had the sense to bring the washing in.",
    "Where is\nshe\n\nAgain the red setter nosed at what seemed to be a pile of clothes and\nraised her nose high in the air and howled again.",
    "Whats the matter with the dog\n\nMiss Hinchliffe strode across the grass.",
    "And quickly apprehensively Miss Marple ran after her.",
    "They stood\nthere side by side the rain beating down on them and the older\nwomans arm went round the younger ones shoulders.",
    "She felt the muscles go stiff and taut as Miss Hinchliffe stood looking\ndown on the thing lying there with the blue congested face and the\nprotruding tongue.",
    "Ill kill whoever did this said Miss Hinchliffe in a low quiet voice if I\nonce get my hands on her...\n\nMiss Marple said questioningly\n\n\fHer\n\nMiss Hinchliffe turned a ravaged face towards her.",
    "Yes.",
    "I know who it is  near enough... That is its one of three\npossibles.",
    "She stood for another moment looking down at her dead friend and\nthen turned towards the house.",
    "Her voice was dry and hard.",
    "We must ring up the police she said.",
    "And while were waiting for\nthem Ill tell you.",
    "My fault in a way that Murgatroyds lying out there.",
    "I\nmade a game of it...",
    "Murder isnt a game...\n\nNo said Miss Marple.",
    "Murder isnt a game.",
    "You know something about it dont you said Miss Hinchliffe as she\nlifted the receiver and dialled.",
    "She made a brief report and hung up.",
    "Theyll be here in a few minutes...",
    "Yes I heard that youd been mixed\nup in this sort of business before...",
    "I think it was Edmund Swettenham\ntold me so... Do you want to hear what we were doing Murgatroyd and\nI\n\nSuccinctly she described the conversation held before her departure\nfor the station.",
    "She called after me you know.",
    "Just as I was leaving... Thats how I\nknow its a woman and not a man...",
    "If Id waited  if only Id listened God\ndammit the dog could have stopped where she was for another quarter\nof an hour.",
    "Dont blame yourself my dear.",
    "That does no good.",
    "One cant foresee.",
    "No one cant... Something tapped against the window I remember.",
    "Perhaps she was outside there then  yes of course she must have\nbeen... coming to the house... and there were Murgatroyd and I\nshouting at each other.",
    "Top of our voices... She heard... She heard it\nall...\n\nYou havent told me yet what your friend said.",
    "Just one sentence She wasnt there.",
    "She paused.",
    "You see There\nwere three women we hadnt eliminated.",
    "Mrs. Swettenham Mrs.\nEasterbrook Julia Simmons.",
    "And one of those three  wasnt there...\nShe wasnt there in the drawingroom because she had slipped out\nthrough the other door and was out in the hall.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple I see.",
    "Its one of those three women.",
    "I dont know which.",
    "But Ill find out\n\nExcuse me said Miss Marple.",
    "But did she  did Miss Murgatroyd I\nmean say it exactly as you said it\n\nHow dyou mean  as I said it\n\n\fOh dear how can I explain You said it like this.",
    "She  wasnt  there.",
    "An equal emphasis on every word.",
    "You see there are three ways you\ncould say it.",
    "You could say She wasnt there.",
    "Very personal.",
    "Or again.",
    "She wasnt there.",
    "Confirming some suspicion already held.",
    "Or else you\ncould say and this is nearer to the way you said it just now She\nwasnt there... quite blankly with the emphasis if there was emphasis\non the there.",
    "I dont know Miss Hinchliffe shook her head.",
    "I cant remember...\nHow the hell can I remember I think yes surely shed say She wasnt\nthere That would be the natural way I should think.",
    "But I simply dont\nknow.",
    "Does it make any difference\n\nChapter 20 MISS MARPLE IS MISSING\n\nThe postman rather to his disgust had lately been given orders to\nmake an afternoon delivery of letters in Chipping Cleghorn as well as a\nmorning one.",
    "On this particular afternoon he left three letters at Little Paddocks at\nexactly ten minutes to five.",
    "One was addressed to Phillipa Haymes in a schoolboys hand the other\ntwo were for Miss Blacklog.",
    "She opened them as she and Phillipa sat\ndown at the tea table.",
    "The torrential rain had enabled Phillipa to leave\nDayas Hall early today since once she had shut up the greenhouses\nthere was nothing more to do.",
    "Miss Blacklog tore open her first letter which was a bill for repairing the\nkitchen boiler.",
    "She snorted angrily.",
    "Dymonds prices are preposterous  quite preposterous.",
    "Still I\nsuppose all the other people are just as bad.",
    "She opened the second letter which was in a handwriting quite\nunknown to her.",
    "Dear Cousin Letty\n\nI hope it will be all right for me to come to you on Tuesday I wrote to\nPatrick two days ago but he hasnt answered.",
    "So I presume its all right.",
    "Mother is coming to England next month and hopes to see you then.",
    "My train arrives at Chipping Cleghorn at 615 if thats convenient\n\nYours affectionately\n\nJulia Simmons\n\nMiss Blacklog read the letter once with astonishment pure and simple\nand then again with a certain grimness.",
    "She looked up at Phillipa who was smiling over her sons letter.",
    "Are Julia and Patrick back do you know\n\nPhillipa looked up.",
    "Yes they came in just after I did.",
    "They went upstairs to change.",
    "They\nwere wet.",
    "Perhaps youd not mind going and calling them.",
    "Of course I will.",
    "Wait a moment  Id like you to read this.",
    "She handed Phillipa the letter she had received.",
    "Phillipa read it and frowned.",
    "I dont understand...",
    "Nor do I quite...",
    "I think its about time I did.",
    "Call Patrick and Julia\nPhillipa.",
    "Phillipa called from the bottom of the stairs Patrick Julia Miss\nBlacklog wants you.",
    "Patrick came running down the stairs and entered the room.",
    "Dont go Phillipa said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Hallo Aunt Letty said Patrick cheerfully.",
    "Want me\n\nYes I do.",
    "Perhaps youll give me an explanation of this\n\nPatricks face showed an almost comical dismay as he read.",
    "I meant to telegraph her What an ass I am\n\nThis letter I presume is from your sister Julia\n\nYes  yes it is.",
    "Miss Blacklog said grimly\n\nThen who may I ask is the young woman whom you brought here as\nJulia Simmons and whom I was given to understand was your sister\nand my cousin\n\nWell  you see  Aunt Letty  the fact of the matter is  I can explain it all\n I know I oughtnt to have done it  but it really seemed more of a lark\nthan anything else.",
    "If youll just let me explain \n\nI am waiting for you to explain.",
    "Who is this young woman\n\nWell I met her at a cocktail party soon after I got demobbed.",
    "We got\ntalking and I said I was coming here and then  well we thought it might\nbe rather a good wheeze if I brought her along... You see Julia the real\nJulia was mad to go on the stage and Mother had seven fits at the idea however Julia got a chance to join a jolly good repertory company up\nin Perth or somewhere and she thought shed give it a try  but she\nthought shed keep Mum calm by letting Mum think that she was here\nwith me studying to be a dispenser like a good little girl.",
    "I still want to know who this other young woman is.",
    "Patrick turned with relief as Julia cool and aloof came into the room.",
    "The balloons gone up he said.",
    "Julia raised her eyebrows.",
    "Then still cool she came forward and sat\ndown.",
    "O.K.",
    "she said.",
    "Thats that.",
    "I suppose youre very angry She\nstudied Miss Blacklogs face with almost dispassionate interest.",
    "I\nshould be if I were you.",
    "Who are you\n\nJulia sighed.",
    "I think the moments come when I make a clean breast of things.",
    "Here\nwe go.",
    "Im one half of the Pip and Emma combination.",
    "To be exact my\nchristened name is Emma Jocelyn Stamfordis  only Father soon\ndropped the Stamfordis.",
    "I think he called himself de Courcy next.",
    "My father and mother let me tell you split up about three years after\nPip and I were born.",
    "Each of them went their own way.",
    "And they split us\nup.",
    "I was Fathers part of the loot.",
    "He was a bad parent on the whole\nthough quite a charming one.",
    "I had various desert spells of being\neducated in convents  when Father hadnt any money or was\npreparing to engage in some particularly nefarious deal.",
    "He used to pay\nthe first term with every sign of affluence and then depart and leave me\non the nuns hands for a year or two.",
    "In the intervals he and I had some\n\n\fvery good times together moving in cosmopolitan society.",
    "However\nthe war separated us completely.",
    "Ive no idea of whats happened to\nhim.",
    "I had a few adventures myself.",
    "I was with the French Resistance\nfor a time.",
    "Quite exciting.",
    "To cut a long story short I landed up in\nLondon and began to think about my future.",
    "I knew that Mothers\nbrother with whom shed had a frightful row had died a very rich man.",
    "I\nlooked up his will to see if there was anything for me.",
    "There wasnt  not\ndirectly that is to say.",
    "I made a few inquiries about his widow  it\nseemed she was quite gaga and kept under drugs and was dying by\ninches.",
    "Frankly it looked as though you were my best bet.",
    "You were\ngoing to come into a hell of a lot of money and from all I could find out\nyou didnt seem to have anyone much to spend it on.",
    "Ill be quite frank.",
    "It occurred to me that if I could get to know you in a friendly kind of way\nand if you took a fancy to me  well after all conditions have changed a\nbit havent they since Uncle Randall died I mean any money we ever\nhad has been swept away in the cataclysm of Europe.",
    "I thought you\nmight pity a poor orphan girl all alone in the world and make her\nperhaps a small allowance.",
    "Oh you did did you said Miss Blacklog grimly.",
    "Yes.",
    "Of course I hadnt seen you then...",
    "I visualised a kind of sob stuff\napproach... Then by a marvellous stroke of luck I met Patrick here and he turned out to be your nephew or your cousin or something.",
    "Well\nthat struck me as a marvellous chance.",
    "I went bullheaded for Patrick\nand he fell for me in a most gratifying way.",
    "The real Julia was all wet\nabout this acting stuff and I soon persuaded her it was her duty to Art to\ngo and fix herself up in some uncomfortable lodgings in Perth and train\nto be the new Sarah Bernhardt.",
    "You mustnt blame Patrick too much.",
    "He felt awfully sorry for me all\nalone in the world  and he soon thought it would be a really marvellous\nidea for me to come here as his sister and do my stuff.",
    "And he also approved of your continuing to tell a tissue of lies to the\nPolice\n\nHave a heart Letty.",
    "Dont you see that when that ridiculous holdup\nbusiness happened  or rather after it happened  I began to feel I was\nin a bit of a spot.",
    "Lets face it Ive got a perfectly good motive for\nputting you out of the way.",
    "Youve only got my word for it now that I\nwasnt the one who tried to do it.",
    "You cant expect me deliberately to go\nand incriminate myself.",
    "Even Patrick got nasty ideas about me from\ntime to time and if even he could think things like that what on earth\nwould the police think That DetectiveInspector struck me as a man of\nsingularly sceptical mind.",
    "No I figured out the only thing for me to do\nwas to sit tight as Julia and just fade away when term came to an end.",
    "How was I to know that fool Julia the real Julia would go and have a\nrow with the producer and fling the whole thing up in a fit of\ntemperament She writes to Patrick and asks if she can come here and\ninstead of wiring her Keep away he goes and forgets to do anything at\nall She cast an angry glance at Patrick.",
    "Of all the utter idiots.",
    "She sighed.",
    "You dont know the straits Ive been put to in Milchester Of course I\nhavent been to the hospital at all.",
    "But I had to go somewhere.",
    "Hours\n\n\fand hours Ive spent in the pictures seeing the most frightful films over\nand over again.",
    "Pip and Emma murmured Miss Blacklog.",
    "I never believed somehow\nin spite of what the Inspector said that they were real \n\nShe looked searchingly at Julia.",
    "Youre Emma she said.",
    "Wheres Pip\n\nJulias eyes limpid and innocent met hers.",
    "I dont know she said.",
    "I havent the least idea.",
    "I think youre lying Julia.",
    "When did you see him last\n\nWas there a momentary hesitation before Julia spoke\n\nShe said clearly and deliberately I havent seen him since we were\nboth three years old  when my mother took him away.",
    "I havent seen\neither him or my mother.",
    "I dont know where they are.",
    "And thats all you have to say\n\nJulia sighed.",
    "I could say I was sorry.",
    "But it wouldnt really be true because actually\nId do the same thing again though not if Id known about this murder\nbusiness of course.",
    "Julia said Miss Blacklog I call you that because Im used to it.",
    "You\nwere with the French Resistance you say\n\nYes.",
    "For eighteen months.",
    "Then I suppose you learned to shoot\n\nAgain those cool blue eyes met hers.",
    "I can shoot all right.",
    "Im a firstclass shot.",
    "I didnt shoot at you Letitia\nBlacklog though youve only got my word for that.",
    "But I can tell you this\nthat if I had shot at you I wouldnt have been likely to miss.",
    "II\n\nThe sound of a car driving up to the door broke through the tenseness\nof the moment.",
    "Who can that be asked Miss Blacklog.",
    "Mitzi put a tousled head in.",
    "She was showing the whites of her eyes.",
    "It is the Police come again she said.",
    "This it is persecution Why will\nthey not leave us alone I will not bear it.",
    "I will write to the Prime\nMinister.",
    "I will write to your King.",
    "Craddocks hand put her firmly and not too kindly aside.",
    "He came in\nwith such a grim set to his lips that they all looked at him\napprehensively.",
    "This was a new Inspector Craddock.",
    "He said sternly Miss Murgatroyd has been murdered.",
    "She was\nstrangled  not more than an hour ago.",
    "His eye singled out Julia.",
    "You Miss Simmons  where have you been all day\n\nJulia said warily\n\nIn Milchester.",
    "Ive just got in.",
    "And you The eye went on to Patrick.",
    "Yes.",
    "Did you both come back here together\n\nYes  yes we did said Patrick.",
    "No said Julia.",
    "Its no good Patrick.",
    "Thats the kind of lie that will be\nfound out at once.",
    "The bus people know us well.",
    "I came back on the\nearlier bus Inspector  the one that gets here at four oclock.",
    "And what did you do then\n\nI went for a walk.",
    "In the direction of Boulders\n\n\fNo I went across the fields.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "Julia her face pale her lips tense stared back.",
    "Before anyone could speak the telephone rang.",
    "Miss Blacklog with an inquiring glance at Craddock picked up the\nreceiver.",
    "Yes.",
    "Who Oh Bunch.",
    "What No.",
    "No she hasnt.",
    "Ive no idea...",
    "Yes\nhes here now.",
    "She lowered the instrument and said Mrs. Harmon would like to speak\nto you Inspector.",
    "Miss Marple has not come back to the Vicarage and\nMrs. Harmon is worried about her.",
    "Craddock took two strides forward and gripped the telephone.",
    "Craddock speaking.",
    "Im worried Inspector.",
    "Bunchs voice came through with a childish\ntremor in it.",
    "Aunt Janes out somewhere  and I dont know where.",
    "And\nthey say that Miss Murgatroyds been killed.",
    "Is it true\n\nYes its true Mrs. Harmon.",
    "Miss Marple was there with Miss Hinchliffe\nwhen they found the body.",
    "Oh so thats where she is.",
    "Bunch sounded relieved.",
    "No  no Im afraid she isnt.",
    "Not now.",
    "She left there about  let me see half an hour ago.",
    "She hasnt got home\n\nNo  she hasnt.",
    "Its only ten minutes walk.",
    "Where can she be\n\nPerhaps shes called in on one of your neighbours\n\nIve rung them up  all of them.",
    "Shes not there.",
    "Im frightened\nInspector.",
    "So am I thought Craddock.",
    "He said quickly\n\nIll come round to you  at once.",
    "Oh do  theres a piece of paper.",
    "She was writing on it before she went\nout.",
    "I dont know if it means anything...",
    "It just seems gibberish to me.",
    "Craddock replaced the receiver.",
    "Miss Blacklog said anxiously\n\nHas something happened to Miss Marple Oh I hope not.",
    "I hope not too.",
    "His mouth was grim.",
    "Shes so old  and frail.",
    "I know.",
    "Miss Blacklog standing with her hand pulling at the choker of pearls\nround her neck said in a hoarse voice\n\nIts getting worse and worse.",
    "Whoevers doing these things must be\nmad Inspector  quite mad...",
    "I wonder.",
    "The choker of pearls round Miss Blacklogs neck broke under the\nclutch of her nervous fingers.",
    "The smooth white globules rolled all over\nthe room.",
    "Letitia cried out in an anguished tone.",
    "My pearls  my pearls  The agony in her voice was so acute that they\nall looked at her in astonishment.",
    "She turned her hand to her throat and rushed sobbing out of the room.",
    "Phillipa began picking up the pearls.",
    "Ive never seen her so upset over anything she said.",
    "Of course she\nalways wears them.",
    "Do you think perhaps that someone special gave\nthem to her Randall Goedler perhaps.",
    "Its possible said the Inspector slowly.",
    "Theyre not  they couldnt be  real by any chance Phillipa asked\nfrom where on her knees she was still collecting the white shining\nglobes.",
    "Taking one in his hand Craddock was just\n\nabout\n\nto reply\n\ncontemptuously Real Of course not when he suddenly stifled the\nwords.",
    "After all could the pearls be real\n\nThey were so large so even so white that their falseness seemed\npalpable but Craddock remembered suddenly a police case where a\nstring of real pearls had been bought for a few shillings in a\npawnbrokers shop.",
    "Letitia Blacklog had assured him that there was no jewellery of value in\nthe house.",
    "If these pearls were by any chance genuine they must be\nworth a fabulous sum.",
    "And if Randall Goedler had given them to her then they might be worth any sum you cared to name.",
    "They looked false  they must be false but  if they were real\n\nWhy not She might herself be unaware of their value.",
    "Or she might\nchoose to protect her treasure by treating it as though it were a cheap\nornament worth a couple of guineas at most.",
    "What would they be worth\nif real A fabulous sum... Worth doing murder for  if anybody knew\nabout them.",
    "With a start the Inspector wrenched himself away from his\nspeculations.",
    "Miss Marple was missing.",
    "He must go to the Vicarage.",
    "III\n\nHe found Bunch and her husband waiting for him their faces anxious\nand drawn.",
    "She hasnt come back said Bunch.",
    "Did she say she was coming back here when she left Boulders asked\nJulian.",
    "She didnt actually say so said Craddock slowly throwing his mind\nback to the last time he had seen Jane Marple.",
    "He remembered the grimness of her lips and the severe frosty light in\nthose usually gentle blue eyes.",
    "Grimness an inexorable determination...\nto do what To go where\n\nShe was talking to Sergeant Fletcher when I last saw her he said.",
    "Just by the gate.",
    "And then she went through it and out.",
    "I took it she\nwas going straight home to the Vicarage.",
    "I would have sent her in the\ncar  but there was so much to attend to and she slipped away very\nquietly.",
    "Fletcher may know something Wheres Fletcher\n\nBut Sergeant Fletcher it seemed as Craddock learned when he rang\nup Boulders was neither to be found there nor had he left any message\n\n\fwhere he had gone.",
    "There was some idea that he had returned to\nMilchester for some reason.",
    "The Inspector rang up headquarters in Milchester but no news of\nFletcher was to be found there.",
    "Then Craddock turned to Bunch as he remembered what she had told\nhim over the telephone.",
    "Wheres that paper You said shed been writing something on a bit of\npaper.",
    "Bunch brought it to him.",
    "He spread it out on the table and looked down\non it.",
    "Bunch leant over his shoulder and spelled it out as he read.",
    "The\nwriting was shaky and not easy to read\n\nLamp.",
    "Then came the word Violets.",
    "Then after a space\n\nWhere is bottle of aspirin\n\nThe next item in this curious list was more difficult to make out.",
    "Delicious Death Bunch read.",
    "Thats Mitzis cake.",
    "Making enquiries read Craddock.",
    "Inquiries What about I wonder Whats this Severe affliction bravely\nborne... What on earth\n\nIodine read the Inspector.",
    "Pearls.",
    "Ah pearls.",
    "And then Lotty  no Letty.",
    "Her es look like os.",
    "And then Berne.",
    "And\nwhats this Old Age Pension...",
    "They looked at each other in bewilderment.",
    "Craddock recapitulated swiftly Lamp.",
    "Violets.",
    "Where is bottle of\naspirin Delicious Death.",
    "Making enquiries.",
    "Severe affliction bravely\nborne.",
    "Iodine.",
    "Pearls.",
    "Letty.",
    "Berne.",
    "Old Age Pension.",
    "Bunch asked Does it mean anything Anything at all I cant see any\nconnection.",
    "Craddock said slowly Ive just a glimmer  but I dont see.",
    "Its odd that\nshe should have put down that about pearls.",
    "What about pearls What does it mean\n\nDoes Miss Blacklog always wear that three tier choker of pearls\n\nYes she does.",
    "We laugh about it sometimes.",
    "Theyre so dreadfully\nfalse looking arent they But I suppose she thinks its fashionable.",
    "There might be another reason said Craddock slowly.",
    "You dont mean that theyre real.",
    "Oh they couldnt be\n\nHow often have you had an opportunity of seeing real pearls of that\nsize Mrs. Harmon\n\nBut theyre so glassy.",
    "Craddock shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Anyway they dont matter now.",
    "Its Miss Marple that matters.",
    "Weve\ngot to find her.",
    "Theyd got to find her before it was too late  but perhaps it was already\ntoo late Those pencilled words showed that she was on the track...",
    "But\nthat was dangerous  horribly dangerous.",
    "And where the hell was\nFletcher\n\nCraddock strode out of the Vicarage to where hed left his car.",
    "Search that was all he could do  search.",
    "A voice spoke to him out of the dripping laurels.",
    "Sir said Sergeant Fletcher urgently.",
    "Sir...\n\nChapter 21 THREE WOMEN\n\nDinner was over at Little Paddocks.",
    "It had been a silent and\nuncomfortable meal.",
    "Patrick uneasily aware of having fallen from grace only made\nspasmodic attempts at conversation  and such as he did make were\nnot well received.",
    "Phillipa Haymes was sunk in abstraction.",
    "Miss\nBlacklog herself had abandoned the effort to behave with her normal\ncheerfulness.",
    "She had changed for dinner and had come down wearing\nher necklace of cameos but for the first time fear showed from her\ndarkly circled eyes and betrayed itself by her twitching hands.",
    "Julia alone had maintained her air of cynical detachment throughout\nthe evening.",
    "Im sorry Letty she said that I cant pack my bag and go.",
    "But I\npresume the police wouldnt allow it.",
    "I dont suppose Ill darken your\nroof  or whatever the expression is  for long.",
    "I should imagine that\nInspector Craddock will be round with a warrant and the handcuffs any\nmoment.",
    "In fact I cant imagine why something of the kind hasnt\nhappened already.",
    "Hes looking for the old lady  for Miss Marple said Miss Blacklog.",
    "Do you think shes been murdered too Patrick asked with scientific\ncuriosity.",
    "But why What could she know\n\nI dont know said Miss Blacklog dully.",
    "Perhaps Miss Murgatroyd told\nher something.",
    "If shes been murdered too said Patrick there seems to be logically\nonly one person who could have done it.",
    "Who\n\nHinchliffe of course said Patrick triumphantly.",
    "Thats where she\nwas last seen alive  at Boulders.",
    "My solution would be that she never\nleft Boulders.",
    "My head aches said Miss Blacklog in a dull voice.",
    "She pressed her\nfingers to her forehead.",
    "Why should Hinch murder Miss Marple It\ndoesnt make sense.",
    "It would if Hinch had really murdered Murgatroyd said Patrick\ntriumphantly.",
    "Phillipa came out of her apathy to say Hinch wouldnt murder\nMurgatroyd.",
    "Patrick was in an argumentative mood.",
    "She might have if Murgatroyd\nhad blundered on something to show that  she  Hinch  was the\ncriminal.",
    "Anyway Hinch was at the station when Murgatroyd was killed.",
    "She could have murdered Murgatroyd before she left.",
    "Startling them all Letitia Blacklog suddenly screamed out\n\nMurder murder murder  Cant you talk of anything else Im\nfrightened dont you understand Im frightened.",
    "I wasnt before.",
    "I\n\n\fthought I could take care of myself...",
    "But what can you do against a\nmurderer whos waiting  and watching  and biding his time Oh God\n\nShe dropped her head forward on her hands.",
    "A moment later she\nlooked up and apologised stiffly.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "I  I lost control.",
    "Thats all right Aunt Letty said Patrick affectionately.",
    "Ill look after\nyou.",
    "You was all Letitia Blacklog said but the disillusionment behind the\nword was almost an accusation.",
    "That had been shortly before dinner and Mitzi had then created a\ndiversion by coming and declaring that she was not going to cook the\ndinner.",
    "I do not do anything more in this house.",
    "I go to my room.",
    "I lock myself\nin.",
    "I stay there until it is daylight.",
    "I am afraid  people are being killed that Miss Murgatroyd with her stupid English face  who would want to\nkill her Only a maniac Then it is a maniac that is about And a maniac\ndoes not care who he kills.",
    "But me I do not want to be killed There are\nshadows in that kitchen  and I hear noises  I think there is someone\nout in the yard and then I think I see a shadow by the larder door and\nthen it is footsteps I hear.",
    "So I go now to my room and I lock the door\nand perhaps even I put the chest of drawers against it.",
    "And in the\nmorning I tell that cruel hard policeman that I go away from here.",
    "And if\n\n\fhe will not let me I say I scream and I scream and I scream until you\nhave to let me go\n\nEverybody with a vivid recollection of what Mitzi could do in the\nscreaming line shuddered at the threat.",
    "So I go to my room said Mitzi repeating the statement once more to\nmake her intentions quite clear.",
    "With a symbolic action she cast off the\ncretonne apron she had been wearing.",
    "Good night Miss Blacklog.",
    "Perhaps in the morning you may not be alive.",
    "So in case that is so I say\ngoodbye.",
    "She departed abruptly and the door with its usual gentle little whine\nclosed softly after her.",
    "Julia got up.",
    "Ill see to dinner she said in a matteroffact way.",
    "Rather a good\narrangement  less embarrassing for you all than having me sit down at\nthe table with you.",
    "Patrick since hes constituted himself your\nprotector Aunt Letty had better taste every dish first.",
    "I dont want to\nbe accused of poisoning you on top of everything else.",
    "So Julia had cooked and served a really excellent meal.",
    "Phillipa had\ncome out to the kitchen with an offer of assistance but Julia had said\nfirmly that she didnt want any help.",
    "Julia theres something I want to say \n\n\fThis is no time for girlish confidences said Julia firmly.",
    "Go on back\nin the diningroom Phillipa.",
    "Now dinner was over and they were in the drawingroom with coffee on\nthe small table by the fire  and nobody seemed to have anything to say.",
    "They were waiting  that was all.",
    "At 830 Inspector Craddock rang up.",
    "I shall be with you in about a quarter of an hours time he announced.",
    "Im bringing Colonel and Mrs. Easterbrook and Mrs. Swettenham and\nher son with me.",
    "But really Inspector...",
    "I cant cope with people tonight  Miss\nBlacklogs voice sounded as though she were at the end of her tether.",
    "I know how you feel Miss Blacklog.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "But this is urgent.",
    "Have you found Miss Marple\n\nNo said the Inspector and rang off.",
    "Julia took the coffee tray out to the kitchen where to her surprise she\nfound Mitzi contemplating the piled up dishes and plates by the sink.",
    "Mitzi burst into a torrent of words.",
    "See what you do in my so nice kitchen That frying pan  only only for\nomelettes do I use it And you what have you used it for\n\n\fFrying onions.",
    "Ruined  ruined.",
    "It will have now to be washed and never  never  do I\nwash my omelette pan.",
    "I rub it carefully over with a greasy newspaper\nthat is all.",
    "And this saucepan here that you have used  that one I use\nhim only for milk \n\nWell I dont know what pans you use for what said Julia crossly.",
    "You\nchose to go to bed and why on earth youve chosen to get up again I\ncant imagine.",
    "Go away again and leave me to wash up in peace.",
    "No I will not let you use my kitchen.",
    "Oh Mitzi you are impossible\n\nJulia stalked angrily out of the kitchen and at that moment the door bell\nrang.",
    "I do not go to the door Mitzi called from the kitchen.",
    "Julia muttered\nan impolite continental expression under her breath and stalked to the\nfront door.",
    "It was Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "Evening she said in her gruff voice.",
    "Sorry to barge in.",
    "Inspectors\nrung up I expect\n\n\fHe didnt tell us you were coming said Julia leading the way to the\ndrawingroom.",
    "He said I neednt come unless I liked said Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "But I do\nlike.",
    "Nobody\n\noffered\n\nMiss\n\nHinchliffe\n\nsympathy\n\nor\n\nmentioned\n\nMiss\n\nMurgatroyds death.",
    "The ravaged face of the tall vigorous woman told\nits own tale and would have made any expression of sympathy an\nimpertinence.",
    "Turn all the lights on said Miss Blacklog.",
    "And put more coal on the\nfire.",
    "Im cold  horribly cold.",
    "Come and sit here by the fire Miss\nHinchliffe.",
    "The Inspector said he would be here in a quarter of an hour.",
    "It must be nearly that now.",
    "Mitzis come down again said Julia.",
    "Has she Sometimes I think that girls mad  quite mad.",
    "But then\nperhaps were all mad.",
    "Ive no patience with this saying that all people who commit crimes are\nmad barked Miss Hinchliffe.",
    "For me all criminals are sane intelligent\neven... in an awful way.",
    "They heard the sound of an approaching car and soon Inspector\nCraddock came in bringing Coronel and Mrs. Easterbrook and Edmund\nand Mrs. Swettenham along.",
    "All looked circumspect.",
    "In a low voice Coronel Easterbrook said\n\nOh oh A nice fire\n\nMrs. Swettenham tried to cheer the atmosphere up producing almost a\nparody of herself\n\nIts weird isnt it she said.",
    "All of this I mean.",
    "Its best to say nothing.",
    "The trouble is that we dont know who will be next... like in epidemics\nisnt it\n\nMother said Edmund in a voice of acute suffering cant you shut\nup\n\nIm sure dear I dont want to say a word said Mrs. Swettenham and\nsat down on the sofa by Julia.",
    "Inspector Craddock stood near the door.",
    "Facing him almost in a row were the three women.",
    "Julia and Mrs.\nSwettenham on the sofa.",
    "Mrs. Easterbrook on the arm of her husbands\nchair.",
    "He had not brought about this arrangement but it suited him very\nwell.",
    "Miss Blacklog and Miss Hinchliffe were crouching over the fire.",
    "Edmund\nstood near them.",
    "Phillipa was far back in the shadows.",
    "Craddock began without preamble.",
    "You all know that Miss Murgatroyds been killed he began.",
    "Weve\nreason to believe that the person who killed her was a woman.",
    "And for\ncertain other reasons we can narrow it down still more.",
    "Im about to ask\n\n\fcertain ladies here to account for what they were doing between the\nhours of four and fourtwenty this afternoon.",
    "I have already had an\naccount of her movements from  from the young lady who has been\ncalling herself Miss Simmons.",
    "I will ask her to repeat that statement.",
    "At\nthe same time Miss Simmons I must caution you that you need not\nanswer if you think your answers may incriminate you and anything\nyou say will be taken down by Constable Edwards and may be used as\nevidence in court.",
    "You have to say that dont you said Julia.",
    "She was rather pale but\nstill composed.",
    "I repeat that between four and fourthirty I was walking\nalong the field leading down to the brook by Compton Farm.",
    "I came\nback to the road by that field with three poplars in it.",
    "I didnt meet\nanyone as far as I can remember.",
    "I did not go near Boulders.",
    "Mrs. Swettenham\n\nEdmund said Are you cautioning all of us\n\nThe Inspector turned to him.",
    "No.",
    "At the moment only Miss Simmons.",
    "I have no reason to believe that\nany other statement made will be incriminating but anyone of course\nis entitled to have a solicitor present and to refuse to answer questions\nunless he is present.",
    "Oh but that would be very silly and a complete waste of time cried\nMrs. Swettenham.",
    "Im sure I can tell you at once exactly what I was\ndoing.",
    "Thats what you want isnt it Shall I begin now\n\n\fYes please Mrs. Swettenham.",
    "Now let me see.",
    "Mrs. Swettenham closed her eyes opened them\nagain.",
    "Of course I had nothing at all to do with killing Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "Im sure everybody here knows that.",
    "But Im a woman of the world I\nknow quite well that the police have to ask all the most unnecessary\nquestions and write the answers down very carefully because its all\nfor what they call the record.",
    "Thats it isnt it Mrs. Swettenham\nflashed the question at the diligent Constable Edwards and added\ngraciously Im not going too fast for you I hope Constable Edwards\na good shorthand writer but with little social savoirfaire turned red to\nthe ears and replied\n\nIts quite all right madam.",
    "Well perhaps a little slower would be\nbetter.",
    "Mrs. Swettenham resumed her discourse with emphatic pauses where\nshe considered a comma or a full stop might be appropriate.",
    "Well of course its difficult to say  exactly  because Ive not got really\na very good sense of time.",
    "And ever since the war quite half our clocks\nhavent gone at all and the ones that do go are often either fast or slow\nor stop because we havent wound them up.",
    "Mrs. Swettenham paused\nto let this picture of confused time sink in and then went on earnestly\nWhat I think I was doing at four oclock was turning the heel of my sock\nand for some extraordinary reason I was going round the wrong way in purl you know not plain but if I wasnt doing that I must have been\n\n\foutside snipping off the dead chrysanthemums  no that was earlier before the rain.",
    "The rain said the inspector started at 410 exactly.",
    "Did it now That helps a lot.",
    "Of course I was upstairs putting a washbasin in the passage where the rain always comes through.",
    "And it was\ncoming through so fast that I guessed at once that the gutter was\nstopped up again.",
    "So I came down and got my mackintosh and rubber\nboots.",
    "I called Edmund but he didnt answer so I thought perhaps hed\ngot to a very important place in his novel and I wouldnt disturb him and\nIve done it quite often myself before.",
    "With the broom handle you know\ntied on to that long thing you push up windows with.",
    "You mean said Craddock noting bewilderment on his subordinates\nface that you were cleaning out the gutter\n\nYes it was all choked up with leaves.",
    "It took a long time and I got\nrather wet but I got it clear at last.",
    "And then I went in and got changed\nand washed  so smelly dead leaves  and then I went into the kitchen\nand put the kettle on.",
    "It was 615 by the kitchen clock.",
    "Constable Edwards blinked.",
    "Which means finished Mrs. Swettenham triumphantly that it was\nexactly twenty minutes to five.",
    "Or near enough she added.",
    "Did anybody see what you were doing whilst you were out cleaning the\ngutter\n\nNo indeed said Mrs. Swettenham Id soon have roped them in to\nhelp if they had Its a most difficult thing to do singlehanded.",
    "So by your own statement you were outside in a mackintosh and\nboots at the time when the rain was coming down and according to\nyou you were employed during that time in cleaning out a gutter but\nyou have no one who can substantiate that statement\n\nYou can look at the gutter said Mrs. Swettenham.",
    "Its beautifully\nclear.",
    "Did you hear your mother call to you Mr. Swettenham\n\nNo said Edmund.",
    "I was fast asleep.",
    "Edmund said his mother reproachfully I thought you were writing.",
    "Inspector\n\nCraddock\n\nturned\n\nto\n\nMrs.\n\nEasterbrook.",
    "Now\n\nMrs.\n\nEasterbrook\n\nI was sitting with Archie in his study said Mrs. Easterbrook fixing\nwide innocent eyes on him.",
    "We were listening to the wireless together\nwerent we Archie\n\nThere was a pause.",
    "Colonel Easterbrook was very red in the face.",
    "He\ntook his wifes hand in his.",
    "You dont understand these things kitten he said.",
    "I  well I must say Inspector youve rather sprung this business on us.",
    "My wife you know has been terribly upset by all this.",
    "Shes nervous\nand highly strung and doesnt appreciate the importance of  of taking\ndue consideration before she makes a statement.",
    "Archie cried Mrs. Easterbrook reproachfully are you going to say\nyou werent with me\n\nWell I wasnt was I my dear I mean ones got to stick to the facts.",
    "Very important in this sort of inquiry.",
    "I was talking to Lampson the\nfarmer at Croft End about some chicken netting.",
    "That was about a\nquarter to four.",
    "I didnt get home until after the rain had stopped.",
    "Just\nbefore tea.",
    "A quarter to five.",
    "Laura was toasting the scones.",
    "And had you been out also Mrs. Easterbrook\n\nThe pretty face looked more like a weasels than ever.",
    "Her eyes had a\ntrapped look.",
    "No  no I just sat listening to the wireless.",
    "I didnt go out.",
    "Not then.",
    "Id\nbeen out earlier.",
    "About  about halfpast three.",
    "Just for a little walk.",
    "Not\nfar.",
    "She looked as though she expected more questions but Craddock said\nquietly\n\n\fThats all Mrs. Easterbrook.",
    "He went on These statements will be typed out.",
    "You can read them\nand sign them if they are substantially correct.",
    "Mrs. Easterbrook looked at him with sudden venom.",
    "Why dont you ask the others where they were That Haymes woman\nAnd Edmund Swettenham How do you know he was asleep indoors\nNobody saw him.",
    "Inspector Craddock said quietly\n\nMiss Murgatroyd before she died made a certain statement.",
    "On the\nnight of the holdup here someone was absent from this room.",
    "Someone who was supposed to have been in the room all the time.",
    "Miss\nMurgatroyd told her friend the names of the people she did see.",
    "By a\nprocess of elimination she made the discovery that there was someone\nshe did not see.",
    "Nobody could see anything said Julia.",
    "Murgatroyd could said Miss Hinchliffe speaking suddenly in her\ndeep voice.",
    "She was over there behind the door where Inspector\nCraddock is now.",
    "She was the only person who could see anything of\nwhat was happening.",
    "Aha That is what you think is it demanded Mitzi.",
    "She made one of her dramatic entrances flinging open the door and\nalmost knocking Craddock sideways.",
    "She was in a frenzy of excitement.",
    "Ah you do not ask Mitzi to come in here with the others do you you\nstiff policeman I am only Mitzi Mitzi in the kitchen Let her stay in the\nkitchen where she belongs But I tell you that Mitzi as well as anyone\nelse and perhaps better yes better can see things.",
    "Yes I see things.",
    "I\nsee something the night of the burglary.",
    "I see something and I do not\nquite believe it and I hold my tongue till now.",
    "I think to myself I will not\ntell what it is I have seen not yet.",
    "I will wait.",
    "And when everything had calmed down you meant to ask for a little\nmoney from a certain person eh said Craddock.",
    "Mitzi turned on him like an angry cat.",
    "And why not Why look down your nose Why should I not be paid for it\nif I have been so generous as to keep silence Especially if some day\nthere will be money  much much money.",
    "Oh I have heard things  I\nknow what goes on.",
    "I know this  Pippemmer  this secret society of\nwhich she  she flung a dramatic finger towards Julia  is an agent.",
    "Yes I would have waited and asked for money  but now I am afraid.",
    "I\nwould rather be safe.",
    "For soon perhaps someone will kill me.",
    "So I will\ntell what I know.",
    "All right then said the Inspector sceptically.",
    "What do you know\n\nI tell you.",
    "Mitzi spoke solemnly.",
    "On that night I am not in the pantry\ncleaning silver as I say  I am already in the diningroom when I hear the\n\n\fgun go off.",
    "I look through the keyhole.",
    "The hall it is black but the gun go\noff again and the torch it falls  and it swings round as it falls  and I see\nher.",
    "I see her there close to him with the gun in her hand.",
    "I see Miss\nBlacklog.",
    "Me Miss Blacklog sat up in astonishment.",
    "You must be mad\n\nBut thats impossible cried Edmund.",
    "Mitzi couldnt have seen Miss\nBlacklog.",
    "Craddock cut in and his voice had the corrosive quality of a deadly acid.",
    "Couldnt she Mr. Swettenham And why not Because it wasnt Miss\nBlacklog who was standing there with the gun It was you wasnt it\n\nI  of course not  what the hell \n\nYou took Colonel Easterbrooks revolver.",
    "You fixed up the business\nwith Rudi Scherz  as a good joke.",
    "You had followed Patrick Simmons\ninto the far room and when the lights went out you slipped out through\nthe carefully oiled door.",
    "You shot at Miss Blacklog and then you killed\nRudi Scherz.",
    "A few seconds later you were back in the drawingroom\nclicking your lighter.",
    "For a moment Edmund seemed at a loss for words then he spluttered\nout\n\nThe whole idea is monstrous.",
    "Why me What earthly motive had I got\n\n\fIf Miss Blacklog dies before Mrs. Goedler two people inherit\nremember.",
    "The two we know of as Pip and Emma.",
    "Julia Simmons has\nturned out to be Emma \n\nAnd you think Im Pip Edmund laughed.",
    "Fantastic  absolutely\nfantastic Im about the right age nothing else.",
    "And I can prove to you\nyou damned fool that I am Edmund Swettenham.",
    "Birth certificate\nschools university  everything.",
    "He isnt Pip.",
    "The voice came from the shadows in the corner.",
    "Phillipa\nHaymes came forward her face pale.",
    "Im Pip Inspector.",
    "You Mrs. Haymes\n\nYes.",
    "Everybody seems to have assumed that Pip was a boy  Julia\nknew of course that her twin was another girl  I dont know why she\ndidnt say so this afternoon \n\nFamily solidarity said Julia.",
    "I suddenly realised who you were.",
    "Id\nhad no idea till that moment.",
    "Id  had the same idea as Julia did said Phillipa her voice trembling\na little.",
    "After I  lost my husband and the war was over I wondered\nwhat I was going to do.",
    "My mother died many years ago.",
    "I found out\nabout my Goedler relations.",
    "Mrs. Goedler was dying and at her death\nthe money would go to a Miss Blacklog.",
    "I found out where Miss Blacklog\nlived and I  I came here.",
    "I took a job with Mrs. Lucas.",
    "I hoped that since\nthis Miss Blacklog was an elderly woman without relatives she might\nperhaps be willing to help.",
    "Not me because I could work but help with\n\n\fHarrys education.",
    "After all it was Goedler money and shed no one\nparticular of her own to spend it on.",
    "And then Phillipa spoke faster it was as though now her long\nreserve had broken down she couldnt get the words out fast enough\nthat holdup happened and I began to be frightened.",
    "Because it\nseemed to me that the only possible person with a motive for killing\nMiss Blacklog was me.",
    "I hadnt the least idea who Julia was  we arent\nidentical twins and were not much alike to look at.",
    "No it seemed as\nthough I was the only one bound to be suspected.",
    "She stopped and pushed her fair hair back from her face and\nCraddock suddenly realised that the faded snapshot in the box of\nletters must have been a photograph of Phillipas mother.",
    "The likeness\nwas undeniable.",
    "He knew too why that mention of closing and unclosing\nhands had seemed familiar  Phillipa was doing it now.",
    "Miss Blacklog has been good to me.",
    "Very very good to me  I didnt try\nto kill her.",
    "I never thought of killing her.",
    "But all the same Im Pip.",
    "She\nadded You see you neednt suspect Edmund any more.",
    "Neednt I said Craddock.",
    "Again there was that acid biting tone in his\nvoice.",
    "Edmund Swettenhams a young man whos fond of money.",
    "A\nyoung man perhaps who would like to marry a rich wife.",
    "But she\nwouldnt be a rich wife unless Miss Blacklog died before Mrs. Goedler.",
    "And since it seemed almost certain that Mrs. Goedler would die before\nMiss Blacklog well  he had to do something about it  didnt you Mr.\nSwettenham\n\n\fIts a damned lie Edmund shouted.",
    "And then suddenly a sound rose on the air.",
    "It came from the kitchen  a\nlong unearthly shriek of terror.",
    "That isnt Mitzi cried Julia.",
    "No said Inspector Craddock its someone whos murdered three\npeople...\n\nChapter 22 THE TRUTH\n\nWhen the Inspector turned on Edmund Swettenham Mitzi had crept\nquietly out of the room and back to the kitchen.",
    "She was running water\ninto the sink when Miss Blacklog entered.",
    "Mitzi gave her a shamefaced sideways look.",
    "What a liar you are\nMitzi said Miss Blacklog pleasantly.",
    "Here  that isnt the way to wash\nup.",
    "The silver first and fill the sink right up.",
    "You cant wash up in about\ntwo inches of water.",
    "Mitzi turned the taps on obediently.",
    "You are not angry at what I say Miss Blacklog she asked.",
    "If I were to be angry at all the lies you tell I should never be out of a\ntemper said Miss Blacklog.",
    "I will go and say to the Inspector that I make it all up shall I asked\nMitzi.",
    "He knows that already said Miss Blacklog pleasantly.",
    "Mitzi turned off the taps and as she did so two hands came up behind\nher head and with one swift movement forced it down into the waterfilled sink.",
    "Only I know that youre telling the truth for once said Miss Blacklog\nviciously.",
    "Mitzi thrashed and struggled but Miss Blacklog was strong and her\nhands held the girls head firmly under water.",
    "Then from somewhere quite close behind her Dora Bunners voice\nrose piteously on the air\n\nOh Lotty  Lotty  dont do it... Lotty.",
    "Miss Blacklog screamed.",
    "Her hands flew up in the air and Mitzi\nreleased came up choking and spluttering.",
    "Miss Blacklog screamed again and again.",
    "For there was no one except\nMitzi there in the kitchen with her...\n\nDora Dora forgive me.",
    "I had to...",
    "I had to \n\n\fShe rushed distractedly towards the scullery door  and the bulk of\nSergeant Fletcher barred her way just as Miss Marple stepped flushed\nand triumphant out of the broom cupboard.",
    "I could always mimic peoples voices said Miss Marple.",
    "Youll have to come with me madam said Sergeant Fletcher.",
    "I was a\nwitness of your attempt to drown this girl.",
    "And there will be other\ncharges.",
    "I must warn you Letitia Blacklog \n\nCharlotte Blacklog corrected Miss Marple.",
    "Thats who she is you\nknow.",
    "Under that choker of pearls she always wears youll find the scar\nof the operation.",
    "Operation\n\nOperation for goitre.",
    "Miss Blacklog quite calm now looked at Miss Marple.",
    "So you know all about it she said.",
    "Yes Ive known for some time.",
    "Charlotte Blacklog sat down by the table and began to cry.",
    "You shouldnt have done that she said.",
    "Not made Doras voice come.",
    "I loved Dora.",
    "I really loved Dora.",
    "Inspector Craddock and the others had crowded in the doorway.",
    "Constable Edwards who added a knowledge of firstaid and artificial\nrespiration to his other accomplishments was busy with Mitzi.",
    "As soon\nas Mitzi could speak she was lyrical with selfpraise.",
    "I do that good do I not I am clever And I am brave Oh I am brave\nVery very nearly was I murdered too.",
    "But I am so brave I risk\neverything.",
    "With a rush Miss Hinchliffe thrust aside the others and leapt upon the\nweeping figure of Charlotte Blacklog by the table.",
    "It took all Sergeant Fletchers strength to hold her off.",
    "Now then  he said.",
    "Now then  no no Miss Hinchliffe \n\nBetween clenched teeth Miss Hinchliffe was muttering\n\nLet me get at her.",
    "Just let me get at her.",
    "It was she who killed Amy\nMurgatroyd.",
    "Charlotte Blacklog looked up and sniffed.",
    "I didnt want to kill her.",
    "I didnt want to kill anybody  I had to  but its\nDora I mind about  after Dora was dead I was all alone  ever since she\ndied  Ive been alone  oh Dora  Dora \n\nAnd once again she dropped her head on her hands and wept.",
    "Chapter 23 EVENING AT THE VICARAGE\n\nMiss Marple sat in the tall armchair.",
    "Bunch was on the floor in front of\nthe fire with her arms round her knees.",
    "The Reverend Julian Harmon was leaning forward and was for once\nlooking more like a schoolboy than a man foreshadowing his own\nmaturity.",
    "And Inspector Craddock was smoking his pipe and drinking a\nwhisky and soda and was clearly very much off duty.",
    "An outer circle\nwas composed of Julia Patrick Edmund and Phillipa.",
    "I think its your story Miss Marple said Craddock.",
    "Oh no my dear boy.",
    "I only just helped a little here and there.",
    "You were\nin charge of the whole thing and conducted it all and you know so\nmuch that I dont.",
    "Well tell it together said Bunch impatiently.",
    "Bit each.",
    "Only let Aunt\nJane start because I like the muddly way her mind works.",
    "When did you\nfirst think that the whole thing was a put up job by the Blacklog\n\nWell my dear Bunch its hard to say.",
    "Of course right at the very\nbeginning it did seem as though the ideal person  or rather the\nobvious person I should say to have arranged the holdup was Miss\nBlacklog herself.",
    "She was the only person who was known to have been\nin contact with Rudi Scherz and how much easier to arrange\nsomething like that when its your own house.",
    "The central heating for\ninstance.",
    "No fires  because that would have meant light in the room.",
    "But the only person who could have arranged not to have a fire was the\nmistress of the house herself.",
    "Not that I thought of all that at the time  it just seemed to me that it\nwas a pity it couldnt be as simple as that Oh no I was taken in like\neveryone else I thought that someone really did want to kill Letitia\nBlacklog.",
    "I think Id like to get clear first on what really happened said Bunch.",
    "Did this Swiss boy recognise her\n\nYes.",
    "Hed worked in \n\nShe hesitated and looked at Craddock.",
    "In Dr. Adolf Kochs clinic in Berne said Craddock.",
    "Koch was a world\nfamous specialist on operations for goitre.",
    "Charlotte Blacklog went\nthere to have her goitre removed and Rudi Scherz was one of the\norderlies.",
    "When he came to England he recognised in the hotel a lady\nwho had been a patient and on the spur of the moment he spoke to her.",
    "I dare say he mightnt have done that if hed paused to think because\nhe left the place under a cloud but that was sometime after Charlotte\nhad been there so she wouldnt know anything about it.",
    "So he never said anything to her about Montreux and his father being a\nhotel proprietor\n\nOh no she made that up to account for his having spoken to her.",
    "It must have been a great shock to her said Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "She felt reasonably safe  and then  the almost impossible mischance\nof somebody turning up who had known her  not as one of the two Miss\nBlacklogs  she was prepared for that  but definitely as Charlotte\nBlacklog a patient whod been operated on for goitre.",
    "But you wanted to go through it all from the beginning.",
    "Well the\nbeginning I think  if Inspector Craddock agrees with me  was when\nCharlotte Blacklog a pretty lighthearted affectionate girl developed\nthat enlargement of the thyroid gland thats called a goitre.",
    "It ruined her\nlife because she was a very sensitive girl.",
    "A girl too who had always\nset a lot of stress on her personal appearance.",
    "And girls just at that age\nin their teens are particularly sensitive about themselves.",
    "If shed had a\nmother or a reasonable father I dont think she would have got into the\nmorbid state she undoubtedly did get into.",
    "She had no one you see to\ntake her out of herself and force her to see people and lead a normal\nlife and not think too much about her infirmity.",
    "And of course in a\ndifferent household she might have been sent for an operation many\nyears earlier.",
    "But Dr. Blacklog I think was an oldfashioned narrowminded\ntyrannical and obstinate man.",
    "He didnt believe in these operations.",
    "Charlotte must take it from him that nothing could be done  apart from\ndosage with iodine and other drugs.",
    "Charlotte did take it from him and I\nthink her sister also placed more faith in Dr. Blacklogs powers as a\nphysician than he deserved.",
    "Charlotte was devoted to her father in a rather weak and soppy way.",
    "She thought definitely that her father knew best.",
    "But she shut herself\n\n\fup more and more as the goitre became larger and more unsightly and\nrefused to see people.",
    "She was actually a kindly affectionate\ncreature.",
    "Thats an odd description of a murderess said Edmund.",
    "I dont know that it is said Miss Marple.",
    "Weak and kindly people are\noften very treacherous.",
    "And if theyve got a grudge against life it saps\nthe little moral strength that they may possess.",
    "Letitia Blacklog of course had quite a different personality.",
    "Inspector\nCraddock told me that Belle Goedler described her as really good  and\nI think Letitia was good.",
    "She was a woman of great integrity who found as she put it herself  a great difficulty in understanding how people\ncouldnt see what was dishonest.",
    "Letitia Blacklog however tempted\nwould never have contemplated any kind of fraud for a moment.",
    "Letitia was devoted to her sister.",
    "She wrote her long accounts of\neverything that happened in an effort to keep her sister in touch with\nlife.",
    "She was worried by the morbid state Charlotte was getting into.",
    "Finally Dr. Blacklog died.",
    "Letitia without hesitation threw up her\nposition with Randall Goedler and devoted herself to Charlotte.",
    "She\ntook her to Switzerland to consult authorities there on the possibility of\noperating.",
    "It had been left very late  but as we know the operation was\nsuccessful.",
    "The deformity was gone  and the scar this operation had\nleft was easily hidden by a choker of pearls or beads.",
    "The war had broken out.",
    "A return to England was difficult and the two\nsisters stayed in Switzerland doing various Red Cross and other work.",
    "Thats right isnt it Inspector\n\nYes Miss Marple.",
    "They got occasional news from England  amongst other things I\nexpect they heard that Belle Goedler could not live long.",
    "Im sure it\nwould be only human nature for them both to have planned and talked\ntogether of the days ahead when a big fortune would be theirs to spend.",
    "One has got to realise I think that this prospect meant much more to\nCharlotte than it did to Letitia.",
    "For the first time in her life Charlotte\ncould go about feeling herself a normal woman a woman at whom no\none looked with either repulsion or pity.",
    "She was free at last to enjoy life\n and she had a whole lifetime as it were to crowd into her remaining\nyears.",
    "To travel to have a house and beautiful grounds  to have\nclothes and jewels and go to plays and concerts to gratify every whim\n it was all a kind of fairy tale come true to Charlotte.",
    "And then Letitia the strong healthy Letitia got flu which turned to\npneumonia and died within the space of a week Not only had Charlotte\nlost her sister but the whole dream existence she had planned for\nherself was cancelled.",
    "I think you know that she may have felt almost\nresentful towards Letitia.",
    "Why need Letitia have died just then when\nthey had just had a letter saying Belle Goedler could not last long Just\none more month perhaps and the money would have been Letitias and hers when Letitia died...\n\n\fNow this is where I think the difference between the two came in.",
    "Charlotte didnt really feel that what she suddenly thought of doing was\nwrong  not really wrong.",
    "The money was meant to come to Letitia  it\nwould have come to Letitia in the course of a few months  and she\nregarded herself and Letitia as one.",
    "Perhaps the idea didnt occur to her until the doctor or someone asked\nher her sisters Christian name  and then she realised how to nearly\neveryone they had appeared as the two Miss Blacklogs  elderly wellbred Englishwomen dressed much the same with a strong family\nresemblance and as I pointed out to Bunch one elderly woman is so\nlike another.",
    "Why shouldnt it be Charlotte who had died and Letitia\nwho was alive\n\nIt was an impulse perhaps more than a plan.",
    "Letitia was buried under\nCharlottes name.",
    "Charlotte was dead Letitia came to England.",
    "All\nthe natural initiative and energy dormant for so many years were now\nin the ascendant.",
    "As Charlotte she had played second fiddle.",
    "She now\nassumed the airs of command the feeling of command that had been\nLetitias.",
    "They were not really so unlike in mentality  though there was\nI think a big difference morally.",
    "Charlotte had of course to take one or two obvious precautions.",
    "She\nbought a house in a part of England quite unknown to her.",
    "The only\npeople she had to avoid were a few people in her own native town in\nCumberland where in any case shed lived as a recluse and of course\nBelle Goedler who had known Letitia so well that any impersonation\nwould have been out of the question.",
    "Handwriting difficulties were got\n\n\fover by the arthritic condition of her hands.",
    "It was really very easy\nbecause so few people had ever really known Charlotte.",
    "But supposing shed met people whod known Letitia asked Bunch.",
    "There must have been plenty of those.",
    "They wouldnt matter in the same way.",
    "Someone might say I came\nacross Letitia Blacklog the other day.",
    "Shes changed so much I really\nwouldnt have known her.",
    "But there still wouldnt be any suspicion in\ntheir minds that she wasnt Letitia.",
    "People do change in the course of\nten years.",
    "Her failure to recognise them could always be put down to\nher shortsightedness and you must remember that she knew every\ndetail of Letitias life in London  the people she met  the places she\nwent.",
    "Shed got Letitias letters to refer to and she could quickly have\ndisarmed any suspicion by mention of some incident or an inquiry after\na mutual friend.",
    "No it was recognition as Charlotte that was the only\nthing she had to fear.",
    "She settled down at Little Paddocks got to know her neighbours and\nwhen she got a letter asking dear Letitia to be kind she accepted with\npleasure the visit of two young cousins she had never seen.",
    "Their\nacceptance of her as Aunt Letty increased her security.",
    "The whole thing was going splendidly.",
    "And then  she made her big\nmistake.",
    "It was a mistake that arose solely from her kindness of heart\nand her naturally affectionate nature.",
    "She got a letter from an old\nschool friend who had fallen on evil days and she hurried to the rescue.",
    "Perhaps it may have been partly because she was in spite of\neverything lonely.",
    "Her secret kept her in a way apart from people.",
    "And\n\n\fshe had been genuinely fond of Dora Bunner and remembered her as a\nsymbol of her own gay carefree days at school.",
    "Anyway on an impulse\nshe answered Doras letter in person.",
    "And very surprised Dora must\nhave been Shed written to Letitia and the sister who turned up in\nanswer to her letter was Charlotte.",
    "There was never any question of\npretending to be Letitia to Dora.",
    "Dora was one of the few old friends\nwho had been admitted to see Charlotte in her lonely and unhappy days.",
    "And because she knew that Dora would look at the matter in exactly\nthe same way as she did herself she told Dora what she had done.",
    "Dora approved wholeheartedly.",
    "In her confused muddleheaded mind it\nseemed only right that dear Lotty should not be done out of her\ninheritance by Lettys untimely death.",
    "Lotty deserved a reward for all\nthe patient suffering she had borne so bravely.",
    "It would have been most\nunfair if all that money should have gone to someone nobody had ever\nheard of.",
    "She quite understood that nothing must be allowed to get out.",
    "It was\nlike an extra pound of butter.",
    "You couldnt talk about it but there was\nnothing wrong about having it.",
    "So Dora came to Little Paddocks  and\nvery soon Charlotte began to understand that she had made a terrible\nmistake.",
    "It was not merely the fact that Dora Bunner with her muddles\nand her mistakes and her bungling was quite maddening to live with.",
    "Charlotte could have put up with that  because she really cared for\nDora and anyway knew from the doctor that Dora hadnt got a very\nlong time to live.",
    "But Dora very soon became a real danger.",
    "Though\nCharlotte and Letitia had called each other by their full names Dora\nwas the kind of person who always uses abbreviations.",
    "To her the\nsisters had always been Letty and Lotty.",
    "And though she schooled her\n\n\ftongue resolutely to call her friend Letty the old name often slipped out.",
    "Memories of the past too were rather apt to come to her tongue  and\nCharlotte had constantly to be on the watch to check these forgetful\nallusions.",
    "It began to get on her nerves.",
    "Still nobody was likely to pay much attention to Doras inconsistencies.",
    "The real blow to Charlottes security came as I say when she was\nrecognised and spoken to by Rudi Scherz at the Royal Spa Hotel.",
    "I think that the money Rudi Scherz used to replace his earlier\ndefalcations at the hotel may have come from Charlotte Blacklog.",
    "Inspector Craddock doesnt believe  and I dont either  that Rudi\nScherz applied to her for money with any idea of blackmail in his head.",
    "He hadnt the faintest idea he knew anything to blackmail her about\nsaid Inspector Craddock.",
    "He knew that he was quite a personable\nyoung man  and he was aware by experience that personable young\nmen sometimes can get money out of elderly ladies if they tell a hard\nluck story convincingly enough.",
    "But she may have seen it differently.",
    "She may have thought that it was\na form of insidious blackmail that perhaps he suspected something and that later if there was publicity in the papers as there might be\nafter Belle Goedlers death he would realise that in her he had found a\ngold mine.",
    "And she was committed to the fraud now.",
    "Shed established herself as\nLetitia Blacklog.",
    "With the Bank.",
    "With Mrs. Goedler.",
    "The only snag was\n\n\fthis rather dubious Swiss hotel clerk an unreliable character and\npossibly a blackmailer.",
    "If only he were out of the way  shed be safe.",
    "Perhaps she made it all up as a kind of fantasy first.",
    "Shed been\nstarved of emotion and drama in her life.",
    "She pleased herself by\nworking out the details.",
    "How would she go about getting rid of him\n\nShe made her plan.",
    "And at last she decided to act on it.",
    "She told her\nstory of a sham holdup at a party to Rudi Scherz explained that she\nwanted a stranger to act the part of the gangster and offered him a\ngenerous sum for his cooperation.",
    "And the fact that he agreed without any suspicion is what makes me\nquite certain that Scherz had no idea that he had any kind of hold over\nher.",
    "To him she was just a rather foolish old woman very ready to part\nwith money.",
    "She gave him the advertisement to insert arranged for him to pay a\nvisit to Little Paddocks to study the geography of the house and\nshowed him the spot where she would meet him and let him into the\nhouse on the night in question.",
    "Dora Bunner of course knew nothing\nabout all this.",
    "The day came  He paused.",
    "Miss Marple took up the tale in her gentle voice.",
    "She must have spent a very miserable day.",
    "You see it still wasnt too\nlate to draw back... Dora Bunner told us that Letty was frightened that\n\n\fday and she must have been frightened.",
    "Frightened of what she was\ngoing to do frightened of the plan going wrong  but not frightened\nenough to draw back.",
    "It had been fun perhaps getting the revolver out of Colonel\nEasterbrooks collar drawer.",
    "Taking along eggs or jam  slipping\nupstairs in the empty house.",
    "It had been fun getting the second door in\nthe drawingroom oiled so that it would open and shut noiselessly.",
    "Fun\nsuggesting the moving of the table outside the door so that Phillipas\nflower arrangements would show to better advantage.",
    "It may have all\nseemed like a game.",
    "But what was going to happen next definitely\nwasnt a game any longer.",
    "Oh yes she was frightened... Dora Bunner\nwas right about that.",
    "All the same she went through with it said Craddock.",
    "And it all went\naccording to plan.",
    "She went out just after six to shut up the ducks and\nshe let Scherz in then and gave him the mask and cloak and gloves and\nthe torch.",
    "Then at 630 when the clock begins to chime shes ready by\nthat table near the archway with her hand on the cigarettebox.",
    "Its all\nso natural.",
    "Patrick acting as host has gone for the drinks.",
    "She the\nhostess is fetching the cigarettes.",
    "Shes judged quite correctly that\nwhen the clock begins to chime everyone will look at the clock.",
    "They\ndid.",
    "Only one person the devoted Dora kept her eyes fixed on her\nfriend.",
    "And she told us in her very first statement exactly what Miss\nBlacklog did.",
    "She said that Miss Blacklog had picked up the vase of\nviolets.",
    "Shed previously frayed the cord of the lamp so that the wires were\nnearly bare.",
    "The whole thing only took a second.",
    "The cigarettebox the\n\n\fvase and the little switch were all close together.",
    "She picked up the\nviolets spilt the water on the frayed place and switched on the lamp.",
    "Waters a good conductor of electricity.",
    "The wires fused.",
    "Just like the other afternoon at the Vicarage said Bunch.",
    "Thats\nwhat startled you so wasnt it Aunt Jane\n\nYes my dear.",
    "Ive been puzzling about those lights.",
    "Id realised that\nthere were two lamps a pair and that one had been changed for the\nother  probably during the night.",
    "Thats right said Craddock.",
    "When Fletcher examined that lamp the\nnext morning it was like all the others perfectly in order no frayed flex\nor fused wires.",
    "Id understood what Dora Bunner meant by saying it had been the\nshepherdess the night before said Miss Marple but I fell into the\nerror of thinking as she thought that Patrick had been responsible.",
    "The interesting thing about Dora Bunner was that she was quite\nunreliable in repeating things she had heard  she always used her\nimagination to exaggerate or distort them and was usually wrong in\nwhat she thought  but she was quite accurate about the things she saw.",
    "She saw Letitia pick up the violets \n\nAnd she saw what she described as a flash and a crackle put in\nCraddock.",
    "And of course when dear Bunch spilt the water from the Christmas\nroses on to the lamp wire  I realised at once that only Miss Blacklog\n\n\fherself could have fused the lights because only she was near that\ntable.",
    "I could kick myself said Craddock.",
    "Dora Bunner even prattled about\na burn on the table where someone had put their cigarette down  but\nnobody had even lit a cigarette... And the violets were dead because\nthere was no water in the vase  a slip on Letitias part  she ought to\nhave filled it up again.",
    "But I suppose she thought nobody would notice\nand as a matter of fact Miss Bunner was quite ready to believe that she\nherself had put no water in the vase to begin with.",
    "He went on\n\nShe was highly suggestible of course.",
    "And Miss Blacklog took\nadvantage of that more than once.",
    "Bunnys suspicions of Patrick were I\nthink induced by her.",
    "Why pick on me demanded Patrick in an aggrieved tone.",
    "It was not I think a serious suggestion  but it would keep Bunny\ndistracted from any suspicion that Miss Blacklog might be stage\nmanagering the business.",
    "Well we know what happened next.",
    "As soon\nas the lights went and everyone was exclaiming she slipped out\nthrough the previously oiled door and up behind Rudi Scherz who was\nflashing his torch round the room and playing his part with gusto.",
    "I dont\nsuppose he realised for a moment she was there behind him with her\ngardening gloves pulled on and the revolver in her hand.",
    "She waits till\nthe torch reaches the spot she must aim for  the wall near which she is\nsupposed to be standing.",
    "Then she fires rapidly twice and as he swings\n\n\fround startled she holds the revolver close to his body and fires again.",
    "She lets the revolver fall by his body throws her gloves carelessly on\nthe hall table then back through the other door and across to where\nshe had been standing when the lights went out.",
    "She nicked her ear  I\ndont quite know how \n\nNail scissors I expect said Miss Marple.",
    "Just a snip on the lobe of\nthe ear lets out a lot of blood.",
    "That was very good psychology of course.",
    "The actual blood running down over her white blouse made it seem\ncertain that she had been shot at and that it had been a near miss.",
    "It ought to have gone off quite all right said Craddock.",
    "Dora\nBunners insistence that Scherz had definitely aimed at Miss Blacklog\nhad its uses.",
    "Without meaning it Dora Bunner conveyed the impression\nthat shed actually seen her friend wounded.",
    "It might have been\nbrought in Suicide or Accidental Death.",
    "And the case would have been\nclosed.",
    "That it was kept open is due to Miss Marple here.",
    "Oh no no.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head energetically.",
    "Any little\nefforts on my part were quite incidental.",
    "It was you who werent\nsatisfied Mr. Craddock.",
    "It was you who wouldnt let the case be\nclosed.",
    "I wasnt happy about it said Craddock.",
    "I knew it was all wrong\nsomewhere.",
    "But I didnt see where it was wrong till you showed me.",
    "And after that Miss Blacklog had a real piece of bad luck.",
    "I discovered\nthat that second door had been tampered with.",
    "Until that moment\nwhatever we agreed might have happened  wed nothing to go upon\n\n\fbut a pretty theory.",
    "But that oiled door was evidence.",
    "And I hit upon it\nby pure chance  by catching hold of a handle by mistake.",
    "I think you were led to it Inspector said Miss Marple.",
    "But then Im\noldfashioned.",
    "So the hunt was up again said Craddock.",
    "But this time with a\ndifference.",
    "We were looking now for someone with a motive to kill\nLetitia Blacklog.",
    "And there was someone with a motive and Miss Blacklog knew it\nsaid Miss Marple.",
    "I think she recognised Phillipa almost at once.",
    "Because Sonia Goedler seems to have been one of the very few people\nwho had been admitted to Charlottes privacy.",
    "And when one is old you\nwouldnt know this yet Mr. Craddock one has a much better memory\nfor a face youve seen when you were young than you have for anyone\nyouve only met a year or two ago.",
    "Phillipa must have been just about\nthe same age as her mother was when Charlotte remembered her and\nshe was very like her mother.",
    "The odd thing is that I think Charlotte was\nvery pleased to recognise Phillipa.",
    "She became very fond of Phillipa\nand I think unconsciously it helped to stifle any qualms of conscience\nshe may have had.",
    "She told herself that when she inherited the money\nshe was going to look after Phillipa.",
    "She would treat her as a daughter.",
    "Phillipa and Harry should live with her.",
    "She felt quite happy and\nbeneficent about it.",
    "But once the Inspector began asking questions and\nfinding out about Pip and Emma Charlotte became very uneasy.",
    "She\ndidnt want to make a scapegoat of Phillipa.",
    "Her whole idea had been to\nmake the business look like a holdup by a young criminal and his\naccidental death.",
    "But now with the discovery of the oiled door the\n\n\fwhole viewpoint was changed.",
    "And except for Phillipa there wasnt as\nfar as she knew for she had absolutely no idea of Julias identity\nanyone with the least possible motive for wishing to kill her.",
    "She did her\nbest to shield Phillipas identity.",
    "She was quickwitted enough to tell you\nwhen you asked her that Sonia was small and dark and she took the old\nsnapshots out of the album so that you shouldnt notice any\nresemblance at the same time as she removed snapshots of Letitia\nherself.",
    "And to think I suspected Mrs. Swettenham of being Sonia Goedler\nsaid Craddock disgustedly.",
    "My poor Mamma murmured Edmund.",
    "A woman of blameless life  or\nso I have always believed.",
    "But of course Miss Marple went on.",
    "It was Dora Bunner who was the\nreal danger.",
    "Every day Dora got more forgetful and more talkative.",
    "I\nremember the way Miss Blacklog looked at her the day we went to tea\nthere.",
    "Do you know why Dora had just called her Lotty again.",
    "It\nseemed to us a mere harmless slip of the tongue.",
    "But it frightened\nCharlotte.",
    "And so it went on.",
    "Poor Dora could not stop herself talking.",
    "That day we had coffee together in the Bluebird I had the oddest\nimpression that Dora was talking about two people not one  and so of\ncourse she was.",
    "At one moment she spoke of her friend as not pretty\nbut having so much character  but almost at the same moment she\ndescribed her as a pretty lighthearted girl.",
    "Shed talk of Letty as so\nclever and so successful  and then say what a sad life shed had and\nthen there was that quotation about stern affliction bravely borne which really didnt seem to fit Letitias life at all.",
    "Charlotte must I think\n\n\fhave overheard a good deal that morning she came into the caf\u00e9.",
    "She\ncertainly must have heard Dora mention about the lamp having been\nchanged  about its being the shepherd and not the shepherdess.",
    "And\nshe realised then what a very real danger to her security poor devoted\nDora Bunner was.",
    "Im afraid that that conversation with me in the caf\u00e9 really sealed\nDoras fate  if youll excuse such a melodramatic expression.",
    "But I think\nit would have come to the same in the end... Because life couldnt be\nsafe for Charlotte while Dora Bunner was alive.",
    "She loved Dora  she\ndidnt want to kill Dora  but she couldnt see any other way.",
    "And I\nexpect like Nurse Ellerton that I was telling you about Bunch she\npersuaded herself that it was really almost a kindness.",
    "Poor Bunny  not\nlong to live anyway and perhaps a painful end.",
    "The queer thing is that\nshe did her best to make Bunnys last day a happy day.",
    "The birthday\nparty  and the special cake...",
    "Delicious Death said Phillipa with a shudder.",
    "Yes  yes it was rather like that... she tried to give her friend a\ndelicious death...",
    "The party and all the things she liked to eat and\ntrying to stop people saying things to upset her.",
    "And then the tablets\nwhatever they were in the aspirin bottle by her own bed so that Bunny\nwhen she couldnt find the new bottle of aspirin shed just bought\nwould go there to get some.",
    "And it would look as it did look that the\ntablets had been meant for Letitia...\n\nAnd so Bunny died in her sleep quite happily and Charlotte felt safe\nagain.",
    "But she missed Dora Bunner  she missed her affection and her\n\n\floyalty the missed being able to talk to her about the old days... She\ncried bitterly the day I came up with that note from Julian  and her grief\nwas quite genuine.",
    "Shed killed her own dear friend...\n\nThats horrible said Bunch.",
    "Horrible.",
    "But its very human said Julian Harmon.",
    "One forgets how human\nmurderers are.",
    "I know said Miss Marple.",
    "Human.",
    "And often very much to be pitied.",
    "But very dangerous too.",
    "Especially a weak kindly murderer like\nCharlotte Blacklog.",
    "Because once a weak person gets realty\nfrightened they get savage with terror and theyve no selfcontrol at\nall.",
    "Murgatroyd said Julian.",
    "Yes poor Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "Charlotte must have come up to the\ncottage and heard them rehearsing the murder.",
    "The window was open\nand she listened.",
    "It had never occurred to her until that moment that\nthere was anyone else who could be a danger to her.",
    "Miss Hinchliffe\nwas urging her friend to remember what shed seen and until that\nmoment Charlotte hadnt realised that anyone could have seen anything\nat all.",
    "Shed assumed that everybody would automatically be looking at\nRudi Scherz.",
    "She must have held her breath outside the window and\nlistened.",
    "Was it going to be all right And then just as Miss Hinchliffe\nrushed off to the station Miss Murgatroyd got to a point which showed\nthat she had stumbled on the truth.",
    "She called after Miss Hinchliffe\nShe wasnt there...",
    "I asked Miss Hinchliffe you know if that was the way she said it...\nBecause if shed said She wasnt there it wouldnt have meant the\nsame thing.",
    "Now thats too subtle a point for me said Craddock.",
    "Miss Marple turned her eager pink and white face to him.",
    "Just think whats going on in Miss Murgatroyds mind... One does see\nthings you know and not know one sees them.",
    "In a railway accident\nonce I remember noticing a large blister of paint at the side of the\ncarriage.",
    "I could have drawn it for you afterward.",
    "And once when there\nwas a flybomb in London  splinters of glass everywhere  and the\nshock  but what I remember best is a woman standing in front of me\nwho had a big hole halfway up the leg of her stockings and the\nstockings didnt match.",
    "So when Miss Murgatroyd stopped thinking and\njust tried to remember what she saw she remembered a good deal.",
    "She started I think near the mantelpiece where the torch must have\nhit first  then it went along the two windows and there were people in\nbetween the windows and her.",
    "Mrs. Harmon with her knuckles screwed\ninto her eyes for instance.",
    "She went on in her mind following the torch\npast Miss Bunner with her mouth open and her eyes staring  past a\nblank wall and a table with a lamp and a cigarettebox.",
    "And then came\nthe shots  and quite suddenly she remembered a most incredible thing.",
    "Shed seen the wall where later there were the two bullet holes the\nwall where Letitia Blacklog had been standing when she was shot and\n\n\fat the moment when the revolver went off and Letty was shot Letty\nhadnt been there...\n\nYou see what I mean now Shed been thinking of the three women\nMiss Hinchliffe had told her to think about.",
    "If one of them hadnt been\nthere it would have been the personality shed have fastened upon.",
    "Shed have said  in effect  Thats the one She wasnt there But it was\na place that was in her mind  a place where someone should have been\n but the place wasnt filled  there wasnt anybody there.",
    "The place was\nthere but the person wasnt.",
    "And she couldnt take it in all at once.",
    "How\nextraordinary Hinch she said.",
    "She wasnt there....",
    "So that could only\nmean Letitia Blacklog...",
    "But you knew before that didnt you said Bunch.",
    "When the lamp\nfused.",
    "When you wrote down those things on the paper.",
    "Yes my dear.",
    "It all came together then you see all the various isolated\nbits and made a coherent pattern.",
    "Bunch quoted softly Lamp Yes.",
    "Violets Yes.",
    "Battle of Aspirin.",
    "You\nmeant that Bunny had been going to buy a new bottle that day and so\nshe ought not to have needed to take Letitias\n\nNot unless her own bottle had been taken or hidden.",
    "It had to appear\nas though Letitia Blacklog was the one meant to be killed.",
    "Yes I see.",
    "And then Delicious Death.",
    "The cake but more than the\ncake.",
    "The whole party setup.",
    "A happy day for Bunny before she died.",
    "Treating her rather like a dog you were going to destroy.",
    "Thats what I\nfind the most horrible thing of all  the sort of spurious kindness.",
    "She was quite a kindly woman.",
    "What she said at the last in the kitchen\nwas quite true.",
    "I didnt want to kill anybody.",
    "What she wanted was a\ngreat deal of money that didnt belong to her And before that desire\nand it had become a kind of obsession  the money was to pay her back\nfor all the suffering life had inflicted on her everything else went to the\nwall.",
    "People with a grudge against the world are always dangerous.",
    "They seem to think life owes them something.",
    "Ive known many an\ninvalid who has suffered far worse and been cut off from life much more\nthan Charlotte Blacklog  and theyve managed to lead happy contented\nlives.",
    "Its whats in yourself that makes you happy or unhappy.",
    "But oh\ndear Im afraid Im straying away from what we were talking about.",
    "Where were we\n\nGoing over your list said Bunch.",
    "What did you mean by Making\nenquiries Inquiries about what\n\nMiss Marple shook her head playfully at Inspector Craddock.",
    "You ought to have seen that Inspector Craddock.",
    "You showed me that\nletter from Letitia Blacklog to her sister.",
    "It had the word enquiries in it\ntwice  each time spelt with an e. But in the note I asked Bunch to show\nyou Miss Blacklog had written inquiries with an i.",
    "People dont often\nalter their spelling as they get older.",
    "It seemed to me very significant.",
    "Yes Craddock agreed.",
    "I ought to have spotted that.",
    "Bunch was continuing.",
    "Severe affliction bravely borne.",
    "Thats what\nBunny said to you in the caf\u00e9 and of course Letitia hadnt had any\naffliction.",
    "Iodine.",
    "That put you on the track of goitre\n\nYes dear.",
    "Switzerland you know and Miss Blacklog giving the\nimpression that her sister had died of consumption.",
    "But I remembered\nthen that the greatest authorities on goitre and the most skilful\nsurgeons operating on it are Swiss.",
    "And it linked up with those really\nrather preposterous pearls that Letitia Blacklog always wore.",
    "Not really\nher style  but just right for concealing the scar.",
    "I understand now her agitation the night the string broke said\nCraddock.",
    "It seemed at the time quite disproportionate.",
    "And after that it was Lotty you wrote  not Letty as we thought said\nBunch.",
    "Yes I remembered that the sisters name was Charlotte and that Dora\nBunner had called Miss Blacklog Lotty once or twice  and that each\ntime she did so she had been very upset afterwards.",
    "And what about Berne and Old Age Pension\n\nRudi Scherz had been an orderly in a hospital in Berne.",
    "And Old Age Pension.",
    "Oh my dear Bunch I mentioned that to you in the Bluebird though I\ndidnt really see the application then.",
    "How Mrs. Wotherspoon drew Mrs.\n\n\fBartletts Old Age Pension as well as her own  though Mrs. Bartlett had\nbeen dead for years  simply because one old woman is so like another\nold woman  yes it all made a pattern and I felt so worked up I went out\nto cool my head a little and think what could be done about proving all\nthis.",
    "Then Miss Hinchliffe picked me up and we found Miss\nMurgatroyd...\n\nMiss Marples voice dropped.",
    "It was no longer excited and pleased.",
    "It\nwas quiet and remorseless.",
    "I knew then something had got to be done.",
    "Quickly But there still\nwasnt any proof.",
    "I thought out a possible plan and I talked to Sergeant\nFletcher.",
    "And I have had Fletcher on the carpet for it said Craddock.",
    "Hed no\nbusiness to go agreeing to your plans without reporting first to me.",
    "He didnt like it but I talked him into it said Miss Marple.",
    "We went up\nto Little Paddocks and I got hold of Mitzi.",
    "Julia drew a deep breath and said I cant imagine how you ever got\nher to do it.",
    "I worked on her my dear said Miss Marple.",
    "She thinks far too much\nabout herself anyway and it will be good for her to have done\nsomething for others.",
    "I flattered her up of course and said I was sure if\nshed been in her own country shed have been in the Resistance\nmovement and she said Yes indeed.",
    "And I said I could see she had\ngot just the temperament for that sort of work.",
    "She was brave didnt\n\n\fmind taking risks and could act a part.",
    "I told her stories of deeds done\nby girls in the Resistance movements some of them true and some of\nthem Im afraid invented.",
    "She got tremendously worked up\n\nMarvellous said Patrick.",
    "And then I got her to agree to do her part.",
    "I rehearsed her til she was\nword perfect.",
    "Then I told her to go upstairs to her room and not come\ndown until Inspector Craddock came.",
    "The worst of these excitable\npeople is that theyre apt to go off halfcocked and start the whole thing\nbefore the time.",
    "She did it very well said Julia.",
    "I dont quite see the point said Bunch.",
    "Of course I wasnt there \nshe added apologetically.",
    "The point was a little complicated  and rather touch and go.",
    "The idea\nwas that Mitzi whilst admitting as though casually that blackmail had\nbeen in her mind was now so worked up and terrified that she was\nwilling to come out with the truth.",
    "Shed seen through the keyhole of\nthe diningroom Miss Blacklog in the hall with a revolver behind Rudi\nScherz.",
    "Shed seen that is what had actually taken place.",
    "Now the only\ndanger was that Charlotte Blacklog might have realised that as the key\nwas in the keyhole Mitzi couldnt possibly have seen anything at all.",
    "But\nI banked on the fact that you dont think of things like that when youve\njust had a bad shock.",
    "All she could take in was that Mitzi had seen her.",
    "Craddock took over the story.",
    "But  and this was essential  I pretended to receive this with\nscepticism and I made an immediate attack as though unmasking my\nbatteries at last upon someone who had not been previously suspected.",
    "I accused Edmund \n\nAnd very nicely I played my part said Edmund.",
    "Hot denial.",
    "All\naccording to plan.",
    "What wasnt according to plan Phillipa my love was\nyou throwing in your little chirp and coming out into the open as Pip.",
    "Neither the Inspector nor I had any idea you were Pip.",
    "I was going to be\nPip It threw us off our stride for the moment but the Inspector made a\nmasterly comeback and made some perfectly filthy insinuations about\nmy wanting a rich wife which will probably stick in your subconscious\nand make irreparable trouble between us one day.",
    "I dont see why that was necessary\n\nDont you It meant that from Charlotte Blacklogs point of view the\nonly person who suspected or knew the truth was Mitzi.",
    "The suspicions\nof the police were elsewhere.",
    "They had treated Mitzi for the moment as\na liar.",
    "But if Mitzi were to persist they might listen to her and take her\nseriously.",
    "So Mitzi had got to be silenced.",
    "Mitzi went straight out of the room and back to the kitchen  just like I\nhad told her said Miss Marple.",
    "Miss Blacklog came out after her almost immediately.",
    "Mitzi was\napparently alone in the kitchen.",
    "Sergeant Fletcher was behind the\nscullery door.",
    "And I was in the broom cupboard in the kitchen.",
    "Luckily\nIm very thin.",
    "Bunch looked at Miss Marple.",
    "What did you expect to happen Aunt Jane\n\nOne of two things.",
    "Either Charlotte would offer Mitzi money to hold her\ntongue  and Sergeant Fletcher would be a witness to that offer or else\nI thought shed try to kill Mitzi.",
    "But she couldnt hope to get away with that Shed have been\nsuspected at once.",
    "Oh my dear she was past reasoning.",
    "She was just a snapping\nterrified cornered rat.",
    "Think what had happened that day.",
    "The scene\nbetween Miss Hinchliffe and Miss Murgatroyd.",
    "Miss Hinchliffe driving off\nto the station.",
    "As soon as she comes back Miss Murgatroyd will explain\nthat Letitia Blacklog wasnt in the room that night.",
    "Theres just a few\nminutes in which to make sure Miss Murgatroyd cant tell anything.",
    "No\ntime to make a plan or set a stage.",
    "Just crude murder.",
    "She greets the\npoor woman and strangles her.",
    "Then a quick rush home to change to\nbe sitting by the fire when the others come in as though shed never\nbeen out.",
    "And then came the revelation of Julias identity.",
    "She breaks her pearls\nand is terrified they may notice her scar.",
    "Later the Inspector\ntelephones that hes bringing everyone there.",
    "No time to think to rest.",
    "Up to her neck in murder now no mercy killing  or undesirable young\nman to be put out of the way.",
    "Crude plain murder.",
    "Is she safe Yes so\nfar.",
    "And then comes Mitzi  yet another danger.",
    "Kill Mitzi stop her\n\n\ftongue Shes beside herself with fear.",
    "Not human any longer.",
    "Just a\ndangerous animal.",
    "But why were you in the broom cupboard Aunt Jane asked Bunch.",
    "Couldnt you have left it to Sergeant Fletcher\n\nIt was safer with two of us my dear.",
    "And besides I knew I could mimic\nDora Bunners voice.",
    "If anything could break Charlotte Blacklog down that would.",
    "And it did...",
    "Yes... she went to pieces.",
    "There was a long silence as memory laid hold of them and then\nspeaking with determined lightness to ease the strain Julia said\n\nIts made a wonderful difference to Mitzi.",
    "She told me yesterday that\nshe was taking a post near Southampton.",
    "And she said Julia produced\na very good imitation of Mitzis accent\n\nI go there and if they say to me you have to register with the Police you are an alien I say to them Yes I will register The Police they\nknow me well.",
    "I assist the Police Without me the Police never would\nthey have made the arrest of a very dangerous criminal.",
    "I risked my life\nbecause I am brave  brave like a lion  I do not care about risks.",
    "Mitzi they say to me you are a heroine you are superb.",
    "Ach it is\nnothing I say.",
    "Julia stopped.",
    "And a great deal more she added.",
    "I think said Edmund thoughtfully that soon Mitzi will have assisted\nthe Police in not one but hundreds of cases\n\nShes softened towards me said Phillipa.",
    "She actually presented me\nwith the recipe for Delicious Death as a kind of wedding present.",
    "She\nadded that I was on no account to divulge the secret to Julia because\nJulia had ruined her omelette pan.",
    "Mrs. Lucas said Edmund is all over Phillipa now that since Belle\nGoedlers death Phillipa and Julia have inherited the Goedler millions.",
    "She sent us some silver asparagus tongs as a wedding present.",
    "I shall\nhave enormous pleasure in not asking her to the wedding\n\nAnd so they lived happily ever after said Patrick.",
    "Edmund and\nPhillipa  and Julia and Patrick he added tentatively.",
    "Not with me you wont live happily ever after said Julia.",
    "The\nremarks that Inspector Craddock improvised to address to Edmund\napply far more aptly to you.",
    "You are the sort of soft young man who\nwould like a rich wife.",
    "Nothing doing\n\nTheres gratitude for you said Patrick.",
    "After all I did for that girl.",
    "Nearly landed me in prison on a murder charge thats what your\nforgetfulness nearly did for me said Julia.",
    "I shall never forget that\n\n\fevening when your sisters letter came.",
    "I really thought I was for it.",
    "I\ncouldnt see any way out.",
    "As it is she added musingly I think I shall go on the stage.",
    "What You too groaned Patrick.",
    "Yes.",
    "I might go to Perth.",
    "See if I can get your Julias place in the rep\nthere.",
    "Then when Ive learnt my job I shall go into theatre management\n and put on Edmunds plays perhaps.",
    "I thought you wrote novels said Julian Harmon.",
    "Well so did I said Edmund.",
    "I began writing a novel.",
