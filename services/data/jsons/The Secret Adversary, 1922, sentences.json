    "\u201cBut may I speak to you for a moment\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.",
    "MR. WHITTINGTON\u2019S OFFER\n\nTUPPENCE turned sharply but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue\nremained unspoken for the man\u2019s appearance and manner did not bear out\nher first and most natural assumption.",
    "She hesitated.",
    "As if he read her\nthoughts the man said quickly\n\n\u201cI can assure you I mean no disrespect.\u201d\n\nTuppence believed him.",
    "Although she disliked and distrusted him\ninstinctively she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive\nwhich she had at first attributed to him.",
    "She looked him up and down.",
    "He\nwas a big man clean shaven with a heavy jowl.",
    "His eyes were small and\ncunning and shifted their glance under her direct gaze.",
    "\u201cWell what is it\u201d she asked.",
    "The man smiled.",
    "\u201cI happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young\ngentleman in Lyons\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWellwhat of it\u201d\n\n\u201cNothingexcept that I think I may be of some use to you.\u201d\n\nAnother inference forced itself into Tuppence\u2019s mind\n\n\u201cYou followed me here\u201d\n\n\u201cI took that liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in what way do you think you could be of use to me\u201d\n\nThe man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow.",
    "Tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully.",
    "It bore the inscription\n\u201cMr.",
    "Edward Whittington.\u201d Below the name were the words \u201cEsthonia\nGlassware Co.\u201d and the address of a city office.",
    "Mr. Whittington spoke\nagain\n\n\u201cIf you will call upon me tomorrow morning at eleven o\u2019clock I will\nlay the details of my proposition before you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt eleven o\u2019clock\u201d said Tuppence doubtfully.",
    "\u201cAt eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nTuppence made up her mind.",
    "\u201cVery well.",
    "I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.",
    "Good evening.\u201d\n\nHe raised his hat with a flourish and walked away.",
    "Tuppence remained\nfor some minutes gazing after him.",
    "Then she gave a curious movement of\nher shoulders rather as a terrier shakes himself.",
    "\u201cThe adventures have begun\u201d she murmured to herself.",
    "\u201cWhat does he want\nme to do I wonder There\u2019s something about you Mr. Whittington that I\ndon\u2019t like at all.",
    "But on the other hand I\u2019m not the least bit afraid\nof you.",
    "And as I\u2019ve said before and shall doubtless say again little\nTuppence can look after herself thank you\u201d\n\nAnd with a short sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward.",
    "As a\nresult of further meditations however she turned aside from the direct\nroute and entered a post office.",
    "There she pondered for some moments\na telegraph form in her hand.",
    "The thought of a possible five shillings\nspent unnecessarily spurred her to action and she decided to risk the\nwaste of ninepence.",
    "Disdaining the spiky pen and thick black treacle which a beneficent\nGovernment had provided Tuppence drew out Tommy\u2019s pencil which she had\nretained and wrote rapidly \u201cDon\u2019t put in advertisement.",
    "Will explain\ntomorrow.\u201d She addressed it to Tommy at his club from which in one\nshort month he would have to resign unless a kindly fortune permitted\nhim to renew his subscription.",
    "\u201cIt may catch him\u201d she murmured.",
    "\u201cAnyway it\u2019s worth trying.\u201d\n\nAfter handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home stopping\nat a baker\u2019s to buy three pennyworth of new buns.",
    "Later in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and\nreflected on the future.",
    "What was the Esthonia Glassware Co. and what\nearthly need could it have for her services A pleasurable thrill of\nexcitement made Tuppence tingle.",
    "At any rate the country vicarage had\nretreated into the background again.",
    "The morrow held possibilities.",
    "It was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night and when\nat length she did she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to\nwashing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware which bore an unaccountable\nresemblance to hospital plates\n\nIt wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block\nof buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were\nsituated.",
    "To arrive before the time would look overeager.",
    "So Tuppence\ndecided to walk to the end of the street and back again.",
    "She did so.",
    "On\nthe stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building.",
    "The Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor.",
    "There was a lift but\nTuppence chose to walk up.",
    "Slightly out of breath she came to a halt outside the ground glass door\nwith the legend painted across it \u201cEsthonia Glassware Co.\u201d\n\nTuppence knocked.",
    "In response to a voice from within she turned the\nhandle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office.",
    "A middleaged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the window\nand came towards her inquiringly.",
    "\u201cI have an appointment with Mr. Whittington\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cWill you come this way please.\u201d He crossed to a partition door with\n\u201cPrivate\u201d on it knocked then opened the door and stood aside to let\nher pass in.",
    "Mr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers.",
    "Tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed.",
    "There was something wrong\nabout Mr. Whittington.",
    "The combination of his sleek prosperity and his\nshifty eye was not attractive.",
    "He looked up and nodded.",
    "\u201cSo you\u2019ve turned up all right That\u2019s good.",
    "Sit down will you\u201d\n\nTuppence sat down on the chair facing him.",
    "She looked particularly small\nand demure this morning.",
    "She sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst\nMr. Whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers.",
    "Finally he pushed\nthem away and leaned over the desk.",
    "\u201cNow my dear young lady let us come to business.\u201d His large face\nbroadened into a smile.",
    "\u201cYou want work Well I have work to offer\nyou.",
    "What should you say now to \u00a3100 down and all expenses paid\u201d Mr.\nWhittington leaned back in his chair and thrust his thumbs into the\narmholes of his waistcoat.",
    "Tuppence eyed him warily.",
    "\u201cAnd the nature of the work\u201d she demanded.",
    "\u201cNominalpurely nominal.",
    "A pleasant trip that is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere to\u201d\n\nMr. Whittington smiled again.",
    "\u201cParis.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully.",
    "To herself she said \u201cOf course\nif father heard that he would have a fit But somehow I don\u2019t see Mr.\nWhittington in the role of the gay deceiver.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d continued Whittington.",
    "\u201cWhat could be more delightful To put the\nclock back a few yearsa very few I am sureand reenter one of those\ncharming pensionnats de jeunes filles with which Paris abounds\u201d\n\nTuppence interrupted him.",
    "\u201cA pensionnat\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.",
    "Madame Colombier\u2019s in the Avenue de Neuilly.\u201d\n\nTuppence knew the name well.",
    "Nothing could have been more select.",
    "She\nhad had several American friends there.",
    "She was more than ever puzzled.",
    "\u201cYou want me to go to Madame Colombier\u2019s For how long\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends.",
    "Possibly three months.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is all There are no other conditions\u201d\n\n\u201cNone whatever.",
    "You would of course go in the character of my ward\nand you would hold no communication with your friends.",
    "I should have\nto request absolute secrecy for the time being.",
    "By the way you are\nEnglish are you not\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet you speak with a slight American accent\u201d\n\n\u201cMy great pal in hospital was a little American girl.",
    "I dare say I\npicked it up from her.",
    "I can soon get out of it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary it might be simpler for you to pass as an American.",
    "Details about your past life in England might be more difficult to\nsustain.",
    "Yes I think that would be decidedly better.",
    "Then\u201d\n\n\u201cOne moment Mr. Whittington You seem to be taking my consent for\ngranted.\u201d\n\nWhittington looked surprised.",
    "\u201cSurely you are not thinking of refusing I can assure you that Madame\nColombier\u2019s is a most highclass and orthodox establishment.",
    "And the\nterms are most liberal.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s just it.",
    "The terms are almost too\nliberal Mr. Whittington.",
    "I cannot see any way in which I can be worth\nthat amount of money to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Whittington softly.",
    "\u201cWell I will tell you.",
    "I could doubtless\nobtain some one else for very much less.",
    "What I am willing to pay for\nis a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to\nsustain her part well and also one who will have sufficient discretion\nnot to ask too many questions.\u201d\n\nTuppence smiled a little.",
    "She felt that Whittington had scored.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s another thing.",
    "So far there has been no mention of Mr.\nBeresford.",
    "Where does he come in\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Beresford\u201d\n\n\u201cMy partner\u201d said Tuppence with dignity.",
    "\u201cYou saw us together\nyesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes.",
    "But I\u2019m afraid we shan\u2019t require his services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s off\u201d Tuppence rose.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s both or neither.",
    "Sorrybut that\u2019s\nhow it is.",
    "Good morning Mr. Whittington.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute.",
    "Let us see if something can\u2019t be managed.",
    "Sit down\nagain Miss\u201d He paused interrogatively.",
    "Tuppence\u2019s conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the\narchdeacon.",
    "She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her\nhead.",
    "\u201cJane Finn\u201d she said hastily and then paused openmouthed at the\neffect of those two simple words.",
    "All the geniality had faded out of Whittington\u2019s face.",
    "It was purple\nwith rage and the veins stood out on the forehead.",
    "And behind it all\nthere lurked a sort of incredulous dismay.",
    "He leaned forward and hissed\nsavagely\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s your little game is it\u201d\n\nTuppence though utterly taken aback nevertheless kept her head.",
    "She\nhad not the faintest comprehension of his meaning but she was naturally\nquickwitted and felt it imperative to \u201ckeep her end up\u201d as she phrased\nit.",
    "Whittington went on\n\n\u201cBeen playing with me have you all the time like a cat and mouse\nKnew all the time what I wanted you for but kept up the comedy.",
    "Is that\nit eh\u201d He was cooling down.",
    "The red colour was ebbing out of his face.",
    "He eyed her keenly.",
    "\u201cWho\u2019s been blabbing Rita\u201d\n\nTuppence shook her head.",
    "She was doubtful as to how long she could\nsustain this illusion but she realized the importance of not dragging\nan unknown Rita into it.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d she replied with perfect truth.",
    "\u201cRita knows nothing about me.\u201d\n\nHis eyes still bored into her like gimlets.",
    "\u201cHow much do you know\u201d he shot out.",
    "\u201cVery little indeed\u201d answered Tuppence and was pleased to note that\nWhittington\u2019s uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed.",
    "To have\nboasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind.",
    "\u201cAnyway\u201d snarled Whittington \u201cyou knew enough to come in here and\nplump out that name.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be my own name\u201d Tuppence pointed out.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s likely isn\u2019t it then there would be two girls with a name like\nthat\u201d\n\n\u201cOr I might just have hit upon it by chance\u201d continued Tuppence\nintoxicated with the success of truthfulness.",
    "Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.",
    "\u201cQuit fooling How much do you know And how much do you want\u201d\n\nThe last five words took Tuppence\u2019s fancy mightily especially after a\nmeagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before.",
    "Her present part\nwas of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order but she did\nnot deny its possibilities.",
    "She sat up and smiled with the air of one\nwho has the situation thoroughly well in hand.",
    "\u201cMy dear Mr. Whittington\u201d she said \u201clet us by all means lay our cards\nupon the table.",
    "And pray do not be so angry.",
    "You heard me say yesterday\nthat I proposed to live by my wits.",
    "It seems to me that I have now\nproved I have some wits to live by I admit I have knowledge of a\ncertain name but perhaps my knowledge ends there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesand perhaps it doesn\u2019t\u201d snarled Whittington.",
    "\u201cYou insist on misjudging me\u201d said Tuppence and sighed gently.",
    "\u201cAs I said once before\u201d said Whittington angrily \u201cquit fooling and\ncome to the point.",
    "You can\u2019t play the innocent with me.",
    "You know a great\ndeal more than you\u2019re willing to admit.\u201d\n\nTuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity and then said\nsoftly\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t like to contradict you Mr. Whittington.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we come to the usual questionhow much\u201d\n\nTuppence was in a dilemma.",
    "So far she had fooled Whittington with\ncomplete success but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken\nhis suspicions.",
    "An idea flashed across her brain.",
    "\u201cSuppose we say a little something down and a fuller discussion of the\nmatter later\u201d\n\nWhittington gave her an ugly glance.",
    "\u201cBlackmail eh\u201d\n\nTuppence smiled sweetly.",
    "\u201cOh no Shall we say payment of services in advance\u201d\n\nWhittington grunted.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d explained Tuppence still sweetly \u201cI\u2019m so very fond of\nmoney\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re about the limit that\u2019s what you are\u201d growled Whittington with\na sort of unwilling admiration.",
    "\u201cYou took me in all right.",
    "Thought you\nwere quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife\u201d moralized Tuppence \u201cis full of surprises.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the same\u201d continued Whittington \u201csome one\u2019s been talking.",
    "You say\nit isn\u2019t Rita.",
    "Was it Oh come in.\u201d\n\nThe clerk followed his discreet knock into the room and laid a paper at\nhis master\u2019s elbow.",
    "\u201cTelephone message just come for you sir.\u201d\n\nWhittington snatched it up and read it.",
    "A frown gathered on his brow.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019ll do Brown.",
    "You can go.\u201d\n\nThe clerk withdrew closing the door behind him.",
    "Whittington turned to\nTuppence.",
    "\u201cCome tomorrow at the same time.",
    "I\u2019m busy now.",
    "Here\u2019s fifty to go on\nwith.\u201d\n\nHe rapidly sorted out some notes and pushed them across the table to\nTuppence then stood up obviously impatient for her to go.",
    "The girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner secured them in her\nhandbag and rose.",
    "\u201cGood morning Mr. Whittington\u201d she said politely.",
    "\u201cAt least au\nrevoir I should say.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.",
    "Au revoir\u201d Whittington looked almost genial again a\nreversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving.",
    "\u201cAu revoir my\nclever and charming young lady.\u201d\n\nTuppence sped lightly down the stairs.",
    "A wild elation possessed her.",
    "A\nneighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s give Tommy a surprise\u201d murmured Tuppence and hailed a taxi.",
    "The cab drew up outside the tube station.",
    "Tommy was just within the\nentrance.",
    "His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward\nto assist Tuppence to alight.",
    "She smiled at him affectionately and\nremarked in a slightly affected voice\n\n\u201cPay the thing will you old bean I\u2019ve got nothing smaller than a\nfivepound note\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.",
    "A SET BACK\n\nTHE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been.",
    "To\nbegin with the resources of Tommy\u2019s pockets were somewhat limited.",
    "In\nthe end the fare was managed the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence\nand the driver still holding the varied assortment of coins in his\nhand was prevailed upon to move on which he did after one last hoarse\ndemand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve given him too much Tommy\u201d said Tuppence innocently.",
    "\u201cI\nfancy he wants to give some of it back.\u201d\n\nIt was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Mr. Beresford at length able to relieve his feelings\n\u201cwhat thedickens did you want to take a taxi for\u201d\n\n\u201cI was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting\u201d said Tuppence\ngently.",
    "\u201cAfraidyoumightbelate Oh Lord I give it up\u201d said Mr.\nBeresford.",
    "\u201cAnd really and truly\u201d continued Tuppence opening her eyes very wide\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got anything smaller than a fivepound note.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did that part of it very well old bean but all the same the\nfellow wasn\u2019t taken innot for a moment\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully \u201che didn\u2019t believe it.",
    "That\u2019s the\ncurious part about speaking the truth.",
    "No one does believe it.",
    "I found\nthat out this morning.",
    "Now let\u2019s go to lunch.",
    "How about the Savoy\u201d\n\nTommy grinned.",
    "\u201cHow about the Ritz\u201d\n\n\u201cOn second thoughts I prefer the Piccadilly.",
    "It\u2019s nearer.",
    "We shan\u2019t\nhave to take another taxi.",
    "Come along.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this a new brand of humour Or is your brain really unhinged\u201d\n inquired Tommy.",
    "\u201cYour last supposition is the correct one.",
    "I have come into money and\nthe shock has been too much for me For that particular form of mental\ntrouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited Hors d\u2019\u0153uvre\nLobster \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9ricane Chicken Newberg and P\u00eache Melba Let\u2019s go\nand get them\u201d\n\n\u201cTuppence old girl what has really come over you\u201d\n\n\u201cOh unbelieving one\u201d Tuppence wrenched open her bag.",

    "Miss Cowley told him.",
    "\u201cAnd the curious part of it is\u201d she ended \u201cthat I really did invent\nthe name of Jane Finn I didn\u2019t want to give my own because of poor\nfatherin case I should get mixed up in anything shady.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s so\u201d said Tommy slowly.",

    "You\u2019ve only got one idea in your head.",
    "What I mean is\nwhat about the next step How are you going to keep the game up\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d Tuppence laid down her spoon.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re right Tommy it is a bit of\na poser.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter all you know you can\u2019t bluff him forever.",
    "You\u2019re sure to slip\nup sooner or later.",
    "And anyway I\u2019m not at all sure that it isn\u2019t\nactionableblackmail you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense.",
    "Blackmail is saying you\u2019ll tell unless you are given\nmoney.",
    "Now there\u2019s nothing I could tell because I don\u2019t really know\nanything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm\u201d said Tommy doubtfully.",
    "\u201cWell anyway what are we going to do\nWhittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning but next time\nhe\u2019ll want to know something more before he parts with his money.",
    "He\u2019ll\nwant to know how much you know and where you got your information\nfrom and a lot of other things that you can\u2019t cope with.",
    "What are you\ngoing to do about it\u201d\n\nTuppence frowned severely.",
    "\u201cWe must think.",
    "Order some Turkish coffee Tommy.",
    "Stimulating to the\nbrain.",
    "Oh dear what a lot I have eaten\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have made rather a hog of yourself So have I for that matter but\nI flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours.",
    "Two coffees.\u201d This was to the waiter.",
    "\u201cOne Turkish one French.\u201d\n\nTuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air and snubbed\nTommy when he spoke to her.",
    "\u201cBe quiet.",
    "I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cShades of Pelmanism\u201d said Tommy and relapsed into silence.",
    "\u201cThere\u201d said Tuppence at last.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got a plan.",
    "Obviously what we\u2019ve\ngot to do is to find out more about it all.\u201d\n\nTommy applauded.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t jeer.",
    "We can only find out through Whittington.",
    "We must discover\nwhere he lives what he doessleuth him in fact Now I can\u2019t do it\nbecause he knows me but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons\u2019.",
    "He\u2019s not likely to recognize you.",
    "After all one young man is much like\nanother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI repudiate that remark utterly.",
    "I\u2019m sure my pleasing features and\ndistinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy plan is this\u201d Tuppence went on calmly \u201cI\u2019ll go alone tomorrow.",
    "I\u2019ll put him off again like I did today.",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t\nget any more money at once.",
    "Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr even longer\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hang about outside.",
    "When I come out I shan\u2019t speak to you in\ncase he\u2019s watching.",
    "But I\u2019ll take up my stand somewhere near and when\nhe comes out of the building I\u2019ll drop a handkerchief or something and\noff you go\u201d\n\n\u201cOff I go where\u201d\n\n\u201cFollow him of course silly What do you think of the idea\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of thing one reads about in books.",
    "I somehow feel that in real\nlife one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with\nnothing to do.",
    "People will wonder what I\u2019m up to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the city.",
    "Every one\u2019s in such a hurry.",
    "Probably no one will even\nnotice you at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve made that sort of remark.",
    "Never mind I\nforgive you.",
    "Anyway it will be rather a lark.",
    "What are you doing this\nafternoon\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Tuppence meditatively.",
    "\u201cI had thought of hats Or perhaps\nsilk stockings Or perhaps\u201d\n\n\u201cHold hard\u201d admonished Tommy.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a limit to fifty pounds But\nlet\u2019s do dinner and a show tonight at all events.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather.\u201d\n\nThe day passed pleasantly.",
    "The evening even more so.",
    "Two of the\nfivepound notes were now irretrievably dead.",
    "They met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded citywards.",
    "Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged\ninto the building.",
    "Tommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street then back again.",
    "Just as he came abreast of the building Tuppence darted across the\nroad.",
    "\u201cTommy\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "What\u2019s up\u201d\n\n\u201cThe place is shut.",
    "I can\u2019t make anyone hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it Come up with me and let\u2019s try again.\u201d\n\nTommy followed her.",
    "As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk\ncame out of an office.",
    "He hesitated a moment then addressed himself to\nTuppence.",
    "\u201cWere you wanting the Esthonia Glassware\u201d\n\n\u201cYes please.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s closed down.",
    "Since yesterday afternoon.",
    "Company being wound up\nthey say.",
    "Not that I\u2019ve ever heard of it myself.",
    "But anyway the office\nis to let.\u201d\n\n\u201cThthank you\u201d faltered Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know Mr.\nWhittington\u2019s address\u201d\n\n\u201cAfraid I don\u2019t.",
    "They left rather suddenly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you very much\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cCome on Tuppence.\u201d\n\nThey descended to the street again where they gazed at one another\nblankly.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s torn it\u201d said Tommy at length.",
    "\u201cAnd I never suspected it\u201d wailed Tuppence.",
    "\u201cCheer up old thing it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t it though\u201d Tuppence\u2019s little chin shot out defiantly.",
    "\u201cDo you\nthink this is the end If so you\u2019re wrong.",
    "It\u2019s just the beginning\u201d\n\n\u201cThe beginning of what\u201d\n\n\u201cOf our adventure Tommy don\u2019t you see if they are scared enough to\nrun away like this it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn\nbusiness Well we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.",
    "We\u2019ll run them down\nWe\u2019ll be sleuths in earnest\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but there\u2019s no one left to sleuth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo that\u2019s why we\u2019ll have to start all over again.",
    "Lend me that bit of\npencil.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Wait a minutedon\u2019t interrupt.",
    "There\u201d Tuppence handed\nback the pencil and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had\nwritten with a satisfied eye\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u201d\n\n\u201cAdvertisement.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to put that thing in after all\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it\u2019s a different one.\u201d She handed him the slip of paper.",
    "Tommy read the words on it aloud\n\n\u201cWANTED any information respecting Jane Finn.",
    "Apply Y. A.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.",
    "WHO IS JANE FINN\n\nTHE next day passed slowly.",
    "It was necessary to curtail expenditure.",
    "Carefully husbanded forty pounds will last a long time.",
    "Luckily the\nweather was fine and \u201cwalking is cheap\u201d dictated Tuppence.",
    "An outlying\npicture house provided them with recreation for the evening.",
    "The day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday.",
    "On Thursday the\nadvertisement had duly appeared.",
    "On Friday letters might be expected to\narrive at Tommy\u2019s rooms.",
    "He had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters\nif they did arrive but to repair to the National Gallery where his\ncolleague would meet him at ten o\u2019clock.",
    "Tuppence was first at the rendezvous.",
    "She ensconced herself on a red\nvelvet seat and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes until she saw\nthe familiar figure enter the room.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d returned Mr. Beresford provokingly.",
    "\u201cWhich is your favourite\npicture\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a wretch.",
    "Aren\u2019t there any answers\u201d\n\nTommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to disappoint you old thing by telling you right off.",
    "It\u2019s too bad.",
    "Good money wasted.\u201d He sighed.",
    "\u201cStill there it is.",
    "The\nadvertisement has appeared andthere are only two answers\u201d\n\n\u201cTommy you devil\u201d almost screamed Tuppence.",
    "\u201cGive them to me.",
    "How\ncould you be so mean\u201d\n\n\u201cYour language Tuppence your language They\u2019re very particular at the\nNational Gallery.",
    "Government show you know.",
    "And do remember as I have\npointed out to you before that as a clergyman\u2019s daughter\u201d\n\n\u201cI ought to be on the stage\u201d finished Tuppence with a snap.",
    "\u201cThat is not what I intended to say.",
    "But if you are sure that you have\nenjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have\nkindly provided you free of charge let us get down to our mail as the\nsaying goes.\u201d\n\nTuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him unceremoniously\nand scrutinized them carefully.",
    "\u201cThick paper this one.",
    "It looks rich.",
    "We\u2019ll keep it to the last and\nopen the other first.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight you are.",
    "One two three go\u201d\n\nTuppence\u2019s little thumb ripped open the envelope and she extracted the\ncontents.",
    "\u201cDEAR SIR\n\n\u201cReferring to your advertisement in this morning\u2019s paper I may be able\nto be of some use to you.",
    "Perhaps you could call and see me at the above\naddress at eleven o\u2019clock tomorrow morning.",
    "\u201cYours truly\n\n\u201cA.",
    "CARTER.\u201d\n\n\u201c27 Carshalton Gardens\u201d said Tuppence referring to the address.",

    "Plenty of time to get there if we tube.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe following\u201d said Tommy \u201cis the plan of campaign.",
    "It is my turn to\nassume the offensive.",
    "Ushered into the presence of Mr. Carter he and I\nwish each other good morning as is customary.",
    "He then says \u2018Please take\na seat Mr.er\u2019 To which I reply promptly and significantly \u2018Edward\nWhittington\u2019 whereupon Mr. Carter turns purple in the face and gasps\nout \u2018How much\u2019 Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds I rejoin you\nin the road outside and we proceed to the next address and repeat the\nperformance.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd Tommy.",
    "Now for the other letter.",
    "Oh this is from the\nRitz\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred pounds instead of fifty\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll read it\n\n\u201cDEAR SIR\n\n\u201cRe your advertisement I should be glad if you would call round\nsomewhere about lunchtime.",
    "\u201cYours truly\n\n\u201cJULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cDo I smell a Boche Or only an American millionaire\nof unfortunate ancestry At all events we\u2019ll call at lunchtime.",
    "It\u2019s a\ngood timefrequently leads to free food for two.\u201d\n\nTuppence nodded assent.",
    "\u201cNow for Carter.",
    "We\u2019ll have to hurry.\u201d\n\nCarshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence\ncalled \u201cladylike looking houses.\u201d They rang the bell at No.",
    "27 and a\nneat maid answered the door.",
    "She looked so respectable that Tuppence\u2019s\nheart sank.",
    "Upon Tommy\u2019s request for Mr. Carter she showed them into\na small study on the ground floor where she left them.",
    "Hardly a minute\nelapsed however before the door opened and a tall man with a lean\nhawklike face and a tired manner entered the room.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Y. A.\u201d he said and smiled.",
    "His smile was distinctly attractive.",
    "\u201cDo sit down both of you.\u201d\n\nThey obeyed.",
    "He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at\nher encouragingly.",
    "There was something in the quality of his smile that\nmade the girl\u2019s usual readiness desert her.",
    "As he did not seem inclined to open the conversation Tuppence was\nforced to begin.",
    "\u201cWe wanted to knowthat is would you be so kind as to tell us anything\nyou know about Jane Finn\u201d\n\n\u201cJane Finn Ah\u201d Mr. Carter appeared to reflect.",
    "\u201cWell the question is\nwhat do you know about her\u201d\n\nTuppence drew herself up.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t see that that\u2019s got anything to do with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo But it has you know really it has.\u201d He smiled again in his tired\nway and continued reflectively.",
    "\u201cSo that brings us down to it again.",
    "What do you know about Jane Finn\n\n\u201cCome now\u201d he continued as Tuppence remained silent.",
    "\u201cYou must know\nsomething to have advertised as you did\u201d He leaned forward a little\nhis weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness.",
    "\u201cSuppose you tell me....\u201d\n\nThere was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter\u2019s personality.",
    "Tuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort as she said\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t do that could we Tommy\u201d\n\nBut to her surprise her companion did not back her up.",
    "His eyes were\nfixed on Mr. Carter and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of\ndeference.",
    "\u201cI dare say the little we know won\u2019t be any good to you sir.",
    "But such\nas it is you\u2019re welcome to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTommy\u201d cried out Tuppence in surprise.",
    "Mr. Carter slewed round in his chair.",
    "His eyes asked a question.",
    "Tommy nodded.",
    "\u201cYes sir I recognized you at once.",
    "Saw you in France when I was with\nthe Intelligence.",
    "As soon as you came into the room I knew\u201d\n\nMr. Carter held up his hand.",
    "\u201cNo names please.",
    "I\u2019m known as Mr. Carter here.",
    "It\u2019s my cousin\u2019s house\nby the way.",
    "She\u2019s willing to lend it to me sometimes when it\u2019s a case of\nworking on strictly unofficial lines.",
    "Well now\u201dhe looked from one to\nthe other\u201cwho\u2019s going to tell me the story\u201d\n\n\u201cFire ahead Tuppence\u201d directed Tommy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s your yarn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes little lady out with it.\u201d\n\nAnd obediently Tuppence did out with it telling the whole story from\nthe forming of the Young Adventurers Ltd. downwards.",
    "Mr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner.",
    "Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a\nsmile.",
    "When she had finished he nodded gravely.",
    "\u201cNot much.",
    "But suggestive.",
    "Quite suggestive.",
    "If you\u2019ll excuse my saying\nso you\u2019re a curious young couple.",
    "I don\u2019t knowyou might succeed where\nothers have failed ...",
    "I believe in luck you knowalways have....\u201d\n\nHe paused a moment and then went on.",
    "\u201cWell how about it You\u2019re out for adventure.",
    "How would you like\nto work for me All quite unofficial you know.",
    "Expenses paid and a\nmoderate screw\u201d\n\nTuppence gazed at him her lips parted her eyes growing wider and\nwider.",
    "\u201cWhat should we have to do\u201d she breathed.",
    "Mr. Carter smiled.",
    "\u201cJust go on with what you\u2019re doing now.",
    "Find Jane Finn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes butwho is Jane Finn\u201d\n\nMr. Carter nodded gravely.",
    "\u201cYes you\u2019re entitled to know that I think.\u201d\n\nHe leaned back in his chair crossed his legs brought the tips of his\nfingers together and began in a low monotone\n\n\u201cSecret diplomacy which by the way is nearly always bad policy does\nnot concern you.",
    "It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of\n1915 a certain document came into being.",
    "It was the draft of a secret\nagreementtreatycall it what you like.",
    "It was drawn up ready for\nsignature by the various representatives and drawn up in Americaat\nthat time a neutral country.",
    "It was dispatched to England by a special\nmessenger selected for that purpose a young fellow called Danvers.",
    "It\nwas hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing\nwould have leaked out.",
    "That kind of hope is usually disappointed.",
    "Somebody always talks\n\n\u201cDanvers sailed for England on the Lusitania.",
    "He carried the precious\npapers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin.",
    "It was on that\nparticular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed and sunk.",
    "Danvers\nwas among the list of those missing.",
    "Eventually his body was washed\nashore and identified beyond any possible doubt.",
    "But the oilskin packet\nwas missing\n\n\u201cThe question was had it been taken from him or had he himself\npassed it on into another\u2019s keeping There were a few incidents that\nstrengthened the possibility of the latter theory.",
    "After the torpedo\nstruck the ship in the few moments during the launching of the boats\nDanvers was seen speaking to a young American girl.",
    "No one actually\nsaw him pass anything to her but he might have done so.",
    "It seems to me\nquite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl believing that\nshe as a woman had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore.",
    "\u201cBut if so where was the girl and what had she done with the papers\nBy later advice from America it seemed likely that Danvers had been\nclosely shadowed on the way over.",
    "Was this girl in league with his\nenemies Or had she in her turn been shadowed and either tricked or\nforced into handing over the precious packet\n\n\u201cWe set to work to trace her out.",
    "It proved unexpectedly difficult.",
    "Her name was Jane Finn and it duly appeared among the list of the\nsurvivors but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely.",
    "Inquiries into her antecedents did little to help us.",
    "She was an orphan\nand had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small\nschool out West.",
    "Her passport had been made out for Paris where she\nwas going to join the staff of a hospital.",
    "She had offered her services\nvoluntarily and after some correspondence they had been accepted.",
    "Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the Lusitania the\nstaff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving\nto take up her billet and at not hearing from her in any way.",
    "\u201cWell every effort was made to trace the young ladybut all in vain.",
    "We tracked her across Ireland but nothing could be heard of her after\nshe set foot in England.",
    "No use was made of the draft treatyas might\nvery easily have been doneand we therefore came to the conclusion that\nDanvers had after all destroyed it.",
    "The war entered on another phase\nthe diplomatic aspect changed accordingly and the treaty was never\nredrafted.",
    "Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied.",
    "The\ndisappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost\nin oblivion.\u201d\n\nMr. Carter paused and Tuppence broke in impatiently\n\n\u201cBut why has it all cropped up again The war\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nA hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter\u2019s manner.",
    "\u201cBecause it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all and that\nthey might be resurrected today with a new and deadly significance.\u201d\n\nTuppence stared.",
    "Mr. Carter nodded.",
    "\u201cYes five years ago that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands\ntoday it is a weapon against us.",
    "It was a gigantic blunder.",
    "If its\nterms were made public it would mean disaster....",
    "It might possibly\nbring about another warnot with Germany this time That is an extreme\npossibility and I do not believe in its likelihood myself but that\ndocument undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot\nafford to have discredited in any way at the present moment.",
    "As a party\ncry for Labour it would be irresistible and a Labour Government at this\njuncture would in my opinion be a grave disability for British trade\nbut that is a mere nothing to the real danger.\u201d\n\nHe paused and then said quietly\n\n\u201cYou may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist influence\nat work behind the present Labour unrest\u201d\n\nTuppence nodded.",
    "\u201cThat is the truth.",
    "Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country for the\nspecific purpose of procuring a Revolution.",
    "And there is a certain man\na man whose real name is unknown to us who is working in the dark for\nhis own ends.",
    "The Bolshevists are behind the Labour unrestbut this\nman is behind the Bolshevists.",
    "Who is he We do not know.",
    "He is always\nspoken of by the unassuming title of \u2018Mr.",
    "Brown.\u2019 But one thing is\ncertain he is the master criminal of this age.",
    "He controls a marvellous\norganization.",
    "Most of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated\nand financed by him.",
    "His spies are everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cA naturalized German\u201d asked Tommy.",
    "\u201cOn the contrary I have every reason to believe he is an Englishman.",
    "He\nwas proGerman as he would have been proBoer.",
    "What he seeks to attain\nwe do not knowprobably supreme power for himself of a kind unique in\nhistory.",
    "We have no clue as to his real personality.",
    "It is reported that\neven his own followers are ignorant of it.",
    "Where we have come across his\ntracks he has always played a secondary part.",
    "Somebody else assumes\nthe chief r\u00f4le.",
    "But afterwards we always find that there has been some\nnonentity a servant or a clerk who has remained in the background\nunnoticed and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped us once more.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d Tuppence jumped.",
    "\u201cI wonder\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember in Mr. Whittington\u2019s office.",
    "The clerkhe called him Brown.",
    "You don\u2019t think\u201d\n\nCarter nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cVery likely.",
    "A curious point is that the name is usually mentioned.",
    "An\nidiosyncrasy of genius.",
    "Can you describe him at all\u201d\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t notice.",
    "He was quite ordinaryjust like anyone else.\u201d\n\nMr. Carter sighed in his tired manner.",
    "\u201cThat is the invariable description of Mr. Brown Brought a telephone\nmessage to the man Whittington did he Notice a telephone in the outer\noffice\u201d\n\nTuppence thought.",
    "\u201cNo I don\u2019t think I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.",
    "That \u2018message\u2019 was Mr. Brown\u2019s way of giving an order to his\nsubordinate.",
    "He overheard the whole conversation of course.",
    "Was it after\nthat that Whittington handed you over the money and told you to come\nthe following day\u201d\n\nTuppence nodded.",
    "\u201cYes undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown\u201d Mr. Carter paused.",
    "\u201cWell\nthere it is you see what you are pitting yourselves against Possibly\nthe finest criminal brain of the age.",
    "I don\u2019t quite like it you know.",
    "You\u2019re such young things both of you.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t like anything to\nhappen to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t\u201d Tuppence assured him positively.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll look after her sir\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cAnd I\u2018ll look after you\u201d retorted Tuppence resenting the manly\nassertion.",
    "\u201cWell then look after each other\u201d said Mr. Carter smiling.",
    "\u201cNow\nlet\u2019s get back to business.",
    "There\u2019s something mysterious about this\ndraft treaty that we haven\u2019t fathomed yet.",
    "We\u2019ve been threatened with\nitin plain and unmistakable terms.",
    "The Revolutionary element as good\nas declare that it\u2019s in their hands and that they intend to produce it\nat a given moment.",
    "On the other hand they are clearly at fault about\nmany of its provisions.",
    "The Government consider it as mere bluff\non their part and rightly or wrongly have stuck to the policy of\nabsolute denial.",
    "I\u2019m not so sure.",
    "There have been hints indiscreet\nallusions that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one.",
    "The\nposition is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating\ndocument but couldn\u2019t read it because it was in cipherbut we know\nthat the draft treaty wasn\u2019t in ciphercouldn\u2019t be in the nature of\nthingsso that won\u2019t wash.",
    "But there\u2019s something.",
    "Of course Jane\nFinn may be dead for all we knowbut I don\u2019t think so.",
    "The curious\nthing is that they\u2019re trying to get information about the girl from\nus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "One or two little things have cropped up.",
    "And your story little\nlady confirms my idea.",
    "They know we\u2019re looking for Jane Finn.",
    "Well\nthey\u2019ll produce a Jane Finn of their ownsay at a pensionnat in\nParis.\u201d Tuppence gasped and Mr. Carter smiled.",
    "\u201cNo one knows in the\nleast what she looks like so that\u2019s all right.",
    "She\u2019s primed with a\ntrumpedup tale and her real business is to get as much information as\npossible out of us.",
    "See the idea\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you think\u201dTuppence paused to grasp the supposition fully\u201cthat\nit was as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to Paris\u201d\n\nMr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.",
    "\u201cI believe in coincidences you know\u201d he said.",
    "CHAPTER V. MR. JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER\n\n\u201cWELL\u201d said Tuppence recovering herself \u201cit really seems as though it\nwere meant to be.\u201d\n\nCarter nodded.",
    "\u201cI know what you mean.",
    "I\u2019m superstitious myself.",
    "Luck and all that sort\nof thing.",
    "Fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this.\u201d\n\nTommy indulged in a chuckle.",
    "\u201cMy word I don\u2019t wonder Whittington got the wind up when Tuppence\nplumped out that name I should have myself.",
    "But look here sir we\u2019re\ntaking up an awful lot of your time.",
    "Have you any tips to give us before\nwe clear out\u201d\n\n\u201cI think not.",
    "My experts working in stereotyped ways have failed.",
    "You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task.",
    "Don\u2019t be\ndiscouraged if that too does not succeed.",
    "For one thing there is a\nlikelihood of the pace being forced.\u201d\n\nTuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.",
    "\u201cWhen you had that interview with Whittington they had time before\nthem.",
    "I have information that the big coup was planned for early in\nthe new year.",
    "But the Government is contemplating legislative action\nwhich will deal effectually with the strike menace.",
    "They\u2019ll get wind of\nit soon if they haven\u2019t already and it\u2019s possible that that may bring\nthings to a head.",
    "I hope it will myself.",
    "The less time they have to\nmature their plans the better.",
    "I\u2019m just warning you that you haven\u2019t\nmuch time before you and that you needn\u2019t be cast down if you fail.",
    "It\u2019s not an easy proposition anyway.",
    "That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nTuppence rose.",
    "\u201cI think we ought to be businesslike.",
    "What exactly can we count upon you\nfor Mr. Carter\u201d Mr. Carter\u2019s lips twitched slightly but he replied\nsuccinctly \u201cFunds within reason detailed information on any point\nand no official recognition.",
    "I mean that if you get yourselves into\ntrouble with the police I can\u2019t officially help you out of it.",
    "You\u2019re\non your own.\u201d\n\nTuppence nodded sagely.",
    "\u201cI quite understand that.",
    "I\u2019ll write out a list of the things I want to\nknow when I\u2019ve had time to think.",
    "Nowabout money\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Miss Tuppence.",
    "Do you want to say how much\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly.",
    "We\u2019ve got plenty to go with for the present but when we\nwant more\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be waiting for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes butI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to be rude about the Government if\nyou\u2019ve got anything to do with it but you know one really has the devil\nof a time getting anything out of it And if we have to fill up a blue\nform and send it in and then after three months they send us a green\none and so onwell that won\u2019t be much use will it\u201d\n\nMr. Carter laughed outright.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t worry Miss Tuppence.",
    "You will send a personal demand to me here\nand the money in notes shall be sent by return of post.",
    "As to salary\nshall we say at the rate of three hundred a year And an equal sum for\nMr. Beresford of course.\u201d\n\nTuppence beamed upon him.",
    "\u201cHow lovely.",
    "You are kind.",
    "I do love money I\u2019ll keep beautiful accounts\nof our expenses all debit and credit and the balance on the right side\nand red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom.",
    "I\nreally know how to do it when I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.",
    "Well goodbye and good luck to you both.\u201d\n\nHe shook hands with them and in another minute they were descending the\nsteps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in a whirl.",
    "\u201cTommy Tell me at once who is \u2018Mr.",
    "Carter\u2019\u201d\n\nTommy murmured a name in her ear.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d said Tuppence impressed.",
    "\u201cAnd I can tell you old bean he\u2019s IT\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d said Tuppence again.",
    "Then she added reflectively\n\n\u201cI like him don\u2019t you He looks so awfully tired and bored and yet you\nfeel that underneath he\u2019s just like steel all keen and flashing.",
    "Oh\u201d\n She gave a skip.",
    "\u201cPinch me Tommy do pinch me.",
    "I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s\nreal\u201d\n\nMr. Beresford obliged.",
    "\u201cOw That\u2019s enough Yes we\u2019re not dreaming.",
    "We\u2019ve got a job\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what a job The joint venture has really begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more respectable than I thought it would be\u201d said Tuppence\nthoughtfully.",
    "\u201cLuckily I haven\u2019t got your craving for crime What time is it Let\u2019s\nhave lunchoh\u201d\n\nThe same thought sprang to the minds of each.",
    "Tommy voiced it first.",
    "\u201cJulius P. Hersheimmer\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell there wasn\u2019t much to tellnot till we\u2019ve seen him.",
    "Come on we\u2019d\nbetter take a taxi.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow who\u2019s being extravagant\u201d\n\n\u201cAll expenses paid remember.",
    "Hop in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt any rate we shall make a better effect arriving this way\u201d said\nTuppence leaning back luxuriously.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure blackmailers never arrive\nin buses\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve ceased being blackmailers\u201d Tommy pointed out.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not sure I have\u201d said Tuppence darkly.",
    "On inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer they were at once taken up to his\nsuite.",
    "An impatient voice cried \u201cCome in\u201d in answer to the pageboy\u2019s\nknock and the lad stood aside to let them pass in.",
    "Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either Tommy or\nTuppence had pictured him.",
    "The girl put him down as thirtyfive.",
    "He\nwas of middle height and squarely built to match his jaw.",
    "His face was\npugnacious but pleasant.",
    "No one could have mistaken him for anything but\nan American though he spoke with very little accent.",
    "\u201cGet my note Sit down and tell me right away all you know about my\ncousin.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour cousin\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing.",
    "Jane Finn.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs she your cousin\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father and her mother were brother and sister\u201d explained Mr.\nHersheimmer meticulously.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d cried Tuppence.",
    "\u201cThen you know where she is\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the table.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m darned if I do Don\u2019t you\u201d\n\n\u201cWe advertised to receive information not to give it\u201d said Tuppence\nseverely.",
    "\u201cI guess I know that.",
    "I can read.",
    "But I thought maybe it was her back\nhistory you were after and that you\u2019d know where she was now\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we wouldn\u2019t mind hearing her back history\u201d said Tuppence\nguardedly.",
    "But Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.",
    "\u201cSee here\u201d he declared.",
    "\u201cThis isn\u2019t Sicily No demanding ransom or\nthreatening to crop her ears if I refuse.",
    "These are the British Isles\nso quit the funny business or I\u2019ll just sing out for that beautiful big\nBritish policeman I see out there in Piccadilly.\u201d\n\nTommy hastened to explain.",
    "\u201cWe haven\u2019t kidnapped your cousin.",
    "On the contrary we\u2019re trying to find\nher.",
    "We\u2019re employed to do so.\u201d\n\nMr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.",
    "\u201cPut me wise\u201d he said succinctly.",
    "Tommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded\nversion of the disappearance of Jane Finn and of the possibility of her\nhaving been mixed up unawares in \u201csome political show.\u201d He alluded to\nTuppence and himself as \u201cprivate inquiry agents\u201d commissioned to find\nher and added that they would therefore be glad of any details Mr.\nHersheimmer could give them.",
    "That gentleman nodded approval.",
    "\u201cI guess that\u2019s all right.",
    "I was just a mite hasty.",
    "But London gets my\ngoat I only know little old New York.",
    "Just trot out your questions and\nI\u2019ll answer.\u201d\n\nFor the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers but Tuppence\nrecovering herself plunged boldly into the breach with a reminiscence\nculled from detective fiction.",
    "\u201cWhen did you last see the deceyour cousin I mean\u201d\n\n\u201cNever seen her\u201d responded Mr. Hersheimmer.",
    "\u201cWhat\u201d demanded Tommy astonished.",
    "Hersheimmer turned to him.",
    "\u201cNo sir.",
    "As I said before my father and her mother were brother and\nsister just as you might be\u201dTommy did not correct this view of their\nrelationship\u201cbut they didn\u2019t always get on together.",
    "And when my aunt\nmade up her mind to marry Amos Finn who was a poor school teacher out\nWest my father was just mad Said if he made his pile as he seemed\nin a fair way to do she\u2019d never see a cent of it.",
    "Well the upshot was\nthat Aunt Jane went out West and we never heard from her again.",
    "\u201cThe old man did pile it up.",
    "He went into oil and he went into steel\nand he played a bit with railroads and I can tell you he made Wall\nStreet sit up\u201d He paused.",
    "\u201cThen he diedlast falland I got the\ndollars.",
    "Well would you believe it my conscience got busy Kept\nknocking me up and saying What about your Aunt Jane way out West It\nworried me some.",
    "You see I figured it out that Amos Finn would never\nmake good.",
    "He wasn\u2019t the sort.",
    "End of it was I hired a man to hunt her\ndown.",
    "Result she was dead and Amos Finn was dead but they\u2019d left a\ndaughterJanewho\u2019d been torpedoed in the Lusitania on her way to\nParis.",
    "She was saved all right but they didn\u2019t seem able to hear of her\nover this side.",
    "I guessed they weren\u2019t hustling any so I thought I\u2019d\ncome along over and speed things up.",
    "I phoned Scotland Yard and the\nAdmiralty first thing.",
    "The Admiralty rather choked me off but Scotland\nYard were very civilsaid they would make inquiries even sent a man\nround this morning to get her photograph.",
    "I\u2019m off to Paris tomorrow\njust to see what the Prefecture is doing.",
    "I guess if I go to and fro\nhustling them they ought to get busy\u201d\n\nThe energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous.",
    "They bowed before it.",
    "\u201cBut say now\u201d he ended \u201cyou\u2019re not after her for anything Contempt of\ncourt or something British A proudspirited young American girl might\nfind your rules and regulations in war time rather irksome and get up\nagainst it.",
    "If that\u2019s the case and there\u2019s such a thing as graft in\nthis country I\u2019ll buy her off.\u201d\n\nTuppence reassured him.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s good.",
    "Then we can work together.",
    "What about some lunch Shall we\nhave it up here or go down to the restaurant\u201d\n\nTuppence expressed a preference for the latter and Julius bowed to her\ndecision.",
    "Oysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was brought to\nHersheimmer.",
    "\u201cInspector Japp C.I.D.",
    "Scotland Yard again.",
    "Another man this time.",

    "That Western photographer\u2019s place was\nburned down and all his negatives destroyedthis is the only copy in\nexistence.",

    "No I don\u2019t.",

    "Once again \u201cMr.",
    "Brown\u201d had triumphed.",
    "The immediate result of this setback was to effect a rapprochement\nbetween Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers.",
    "All barriers went\ndown with a crash and Tommy and Tuppence felt they had known the young\nAmerican all their lives.",
    "They abandoned the discreet reticence of\n\u201cprivate inquiry agents\u201d and revealed to him the whole history of\nthe joint venture whereat the young man declared himself \u201ctickled to\ndeath.\u201d\n\nHe turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a mite\nmossgrown.",
    "Oldfashioned and sweet you know but scared to move round\nwithout a footman or a maiden aunt.",
    "I guess I\u2019m a bit behind the times\u201d\n\nThe upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and Tuppence\ntook up their abode forthwith at the Ritz in order as Tuppence put\nit to keep in touch with Jane Finn\u2019s only living relation.",
    "\u201cAnd put\nlike that\u201d she added confidentially to Tommy \u201cnobody could boggle at\nthe expense\u201d\n\nNobody did which was the great thing.",

    "Tommy started\nin pursuit at once and was in time to see them turn the corner of the\nstreet.",
    "His vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them and by\nthe time he in his turn reached the corner the distance between them\nwas sensibly lessened.",
    "The small Mayfair streets were comparatively\ndeserted and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in\nsight.",
    "The sport was a new one to him.",
    "Though familiar with the technicalities\nfrom a course of novel reading he had never before attempted to\n\u201cfollow\u201d anyone and it appeared to him at once that in actual\npractice the proceeding was fraught with difficulties.",
    "Supposing for\ninstance that they should suddenly hail a taxi In books you simply\nleapt into another promised the driver a sovereignor its modern\nequivalentand there you were.",
    "In actual fact Tommy foresaw that it\nwas extremely likely there would be no second taxi.",
    "Therefore he\nwould have to run.",
    "What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran\nincessantly and persistently through the London streets In a main road\nhe might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a\nbus.",
    "But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that\nan officious policeman might stop him to explain matters.",
    "At this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the\ncorner of the street ahead.",
    "Tommy held his breath.",
    "Would they hail it\n\nHe drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged.",
    "Their\ncourse was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible\nto Oxford Street.",
    "When at length they turned into it proceeding in an\neasterly direction Tommy slightly increased his pace.",
    "Little by little\nhe gained upon them.",
    "On the crowded pavement there was little chance of\nhis attracting their notice and he was anxious if possible to catch\na word or two of their conversation.",
    "In this he was completely\nfoiled they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices\neffectually.",
    "Just before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road Tommy\nunperceived faithfully at their heels and entered the big Lyons\u2019.",
    "There they went up to the first floor and sat at a small table in the\nwindow.",
    "It was late and the place was thinning out.",
    "Tommy took a seat\nat the table next to them sitting directly behind Whittington in case\nof recognition.",
    "On the other hand he had a full view of the second man\nand studied him attentively.",
    "He was fair with a weak unpleasant face\nand Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole.",
    "He was\nprobably about fifty years of age his shoulders cringed a little as he\ntalked and his eyes small and crafty shifted unceasingly.",
    "Having already lunched heartily Tommy contented himself with ordering\na Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee.",
    "Whittington ordered a substantial\nlunch for himself and his companion then as the waitress withdrew he\nmoved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly\nin a low voice.",
    "The other man joined in.",
    "Listen as he would Tommy could\nonly catch a word here and there but the gist of it seemed to be some\ndirections or orders which the big man was impressing on his companion\nand with which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree.",
    "Whittington addressed the other as Boris.",
    "Tommy caught the word \u201cIreland\u201d several times also \u201cpropaganda\u201d but\nof Jane Finn there was no mention.",
    "Suddenly in a lull in the clatter of\nthe room he got one phrase entire.",
    "Whittington was speaking.",
    "\u201cAh but\nyou don\u2019t know Flossie.",
    "She\u2019s a marvel.",
    "An archbishop would swear she\nwas his own mother.",
    "She gets the voice right every time and that\u2019s\nreally the principal thing.\u201d\n\nTommy did not hear Boris\u2019s reply but in response to it Whittington said\nsomething that sounded like \u201cOf courseonly in an emergency....\u201d\n\nThen he lost the thread again.",
    "But presently the phrases became distinct\nagain whether because the other two had insensibly raised their voices\nor because Tommy\u2019s ears were getting more attuned he could not tell.",
    "But two words certainly had a most stimulating effect upon the listener.",
    "They were uttered by Boris and they were \u201cMr.",
    "Brown.\u201d\n\nWhittington seemed to remonstrate with him but he merely laughed.",
    "\u201cWhy not my friend It is a name most respectablemost common.",
    "Did\nhe not choose it for that reason Ah I should like to meet himMr.",
    "Brown.\u201d\n\nThere was a steely ring in Whittington\u2019s voice as he replied\n\n\u201cWho knows You may have met him already.\u201d\n\n\u201cBah\u201d retorted the other.",
    "\u201cThat is children\u2019s talka fable for the\npolice.",
    "Do you know what I say to myself sometimes That he is a fable\ninvented by the Inner Ring a bogy to frighten us with.",
    "It might be so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it might not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder ... or is it indeed true that he is with us and amongst us\nunknown to all but a chosen few If so he keeps his secret well.",
    "And\nthe idea is a good one yes.",
    "We never know.",
    "We look at each other\none of us is Mr. Brownwhich He commandsbut also he serves.",
    "Among\nusin the midst of us.",
    "And no one knows which he is....\u201d\n\nWith an effort the Russian shook off the vagary of his fancy.",
    "He looked\nat his watch.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Whittington.",
    "\u201cWe might as well go.\u201d\n\nHe called the waitress and asked for his bill.",
    "Tommy did likewise and a\nfew moments later was following the two men down the stairs.",
    "Outside Whittington hailed a taxi and directed the driver to go to\nWaterloo.",
    "Taxis were plentiful here and before Whittington\u2019s had driven off\nanother was drawing up to the curb in obedience to Tommy\u2019s peremptory\nhand.",
    "\u201cFollow that other taxi\u201d directed the young man.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t lose it.\u201d\n\nThe elderly chauffeur showed no interest.",

    "The drive was uneventful.",
    "Tommy\u2019s taxi came to rest at\nthe departure platform just after Whittington\u2019s.",
    "Tommy was behind him at\nthe bookingoffice.",
    "He took a firstclass single ticket to Bournemouth\nTommy did the same.",
    "As he emerged Boris remarked glancing up at the\nclock \u201cYou are early.",
    "You have nearly half an hour.\u201d\n\nBoris\u2019s words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommy\u2019s mind.",
    "Clearly Whittington was making the journey alone while the other\nremained in London.",
    "Therefore he was left with a choice as to which he\nwould follow.",
    "Obviously he could not follow both of them unless\nLike Boris he glanced up at the clock and then to the announcement\nboard of the trains.",
    "The Bournemouth train left at 3.30.",
    "It was now ten\npast.",
    "Whittington and Boris were walking up and down by the bookstall.",
    "He gave one doubtful look at them then hurried into an adjacent\ntelephone box.",
    "He dared not waste time in trying to get hold of\nTuppence.",
    "In all probability she was still in the neighbourhood of South\nAudley Mansions.",
    "But there remained another ally.",
    "He rang up the Ritz\nand asked for Julius Hersheimmer.",
    "There was a click and a buzz.",
    "Oh if\nonly the young American was in his room There was another click and\nthen \u201cHello\u201d in unmistakable accents came over the wire.",
    "\u201cThat you Hersheimmer Beresford speaking.",

    "I\u2019ve\nfollowed Whittington and another man here.",
    "No time to explain.",
    "Whittington\u2019s off to Bournemouth by the 3.30.",
    "Can you get there by\nthen\u201d\n\nThe reply was reassuring.",
    "\u201cSure.",
    "I\u2019ll hustle.\u201d\n\nThe telephone rang off.",
    "Tommy put back the receiver with a sigh of\nrelief.",
    "His opinion of Julius\u2019s power of hustling was high.",
    "He felt\ninstinctively that the American would arrive in time.",
    "Whittington and Boris were still where he had left them.",
    "If Boris\nremained to see his friend off all was well.",
    "Then Tommy fingered his\npocket thoughtfully.",
    "In spite of the carte blanche assured to him he\nhad not yet acquired the habit of going about with any considerable sum\nof money on him.",
    "The taking of the firstclass ticket to Bournemouth\nhad left him with only a few shillings in his pocket.",
    "It was to be hoped\nthat Julius would arrive better provided.",

    "\u201cGot any money with you\u201d\n\nJulius shook his head and Tommy\u2019s face fell.",
    "\u201cI guess I haven\u2019t more than three or four hundred dollars with me at\nthe moment\u201d explained the American.",
    "Tommy gave a faint whoop of relief.",

    "Here\u2019s your ticket.",

    "Then he\nwalked up Shaftesbury Avenue finally turning off into the maze of mean\nstreets round Soho.",
    "Tommy followed him at a judicious distance.",
    "They reached at length a small dilapidated square.",
    "The houses there had\na sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay.",
    "Boris looked round\nand Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch.",
    "The place was\nalmost deserted.",
    "It was a culdesac and consequently no traffic passed\nthat way.",
    "The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy\u2019s\nimagination.",
    "From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the\nsteps of a particularly evillooking house and rap sharply with a\npeculiar rhythm on the door.",
    "It was opened promptly he said a word or\ntwo to the doorkeeper then passed inside.",
    "The door was shut to again.",
    "It was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head.",
    "What he ought to have\ndone what any sane man would have done was to remain patiently where\nhe was and wait for his man to come out again.",
    "What he did do was\nentirely foreign to the sober common sense which was as a rule his\nleading characteristic.",
    "Something as he expressed it seemed to snap in\nhis brain.",
    "Without a moment\u2019s pause for reflection he too went up the\nsteps and reproduced as far as he was able the peculiar knock.",
    "The door swung open with the same promptness as before.",
    "A\nvillainousfaced man with closecropped hair stood in the doorway.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d he grunted.",

    "THE ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\n\nTAKEN aback though he was by the man\u2019s words Tommy did not hesitate.",
    "If audacity had successfully carried him so far it was to be hoped\nit would carry him yet farther.",
    "He quietly passed into the house and\nmounted the ramshackle staircase.",
    "Everything in the house was filthy\nbeyond words.",
    "The grimy paper of a pattern now indistinguishable\nhung in loose festoons from the wall.",
    "In every angle was a grey mass of\ncobweb.",
    "Tommy proceeded leisurely.",
    "By the time he reached the bend of the\nstaircase he had heard the man below disappear into a back room.",
    "Clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet.",
    "To come to the house and\nask for \u201cMr.",
    "Brown\u201d appeared indeed to be a reasonable and natural\nproceeding.",
    "At the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move.",
    "In\nfront of him ran a narrow passage with doors opening on either side of\nit.",
    "From the one nearest him on the left came a low murmur of voices.",
    "It was this room which he had been directed to enter.",
    "But what held\nhis glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right\nhalf concealed by a torn velvet curtain.",
    "It was directly opposite the\nlefthanded door and owing to its angle it also commanded a good view\nof the upper part of the staircase.",
    "As a hidingplace for one or at a\npinch two men it was ideal being about two feet deep and three feet\nwide.",
    "It attracted Tommy mightily.",
    "He thought things over in his usual\nslow and steady way deciding that the mention of \u201cMr.",
    "Brown\u201d was not a\nrequest for an individual but in all probability a password used by\nthe gang.",
    "His lucky use of it had gained him admission.",
    "So far he had\naroused no suspicion.",
    "But he must decide quickly on his next step.",
    "Suppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage.",
    "Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be\nsufficient Perhaps a further password would be required or at any\nrate some proof of identity.",
    "The doorkeeper clearly did not know all\nthe members of the gang by sight but it might be different upstairs.",
    "On the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far\nbut that there was such a thing as trusting it too far.",
    "To enter\nthat room was a colossal risk.",
    "He could not hope to sustain his part\nindefinitely sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself and\nthen he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness.",
    "A repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below and Tommy\nhis mind made up slipped quickly into the recess and cautiously drew\nthe curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from\nsight.",
    "There were several rents and slits in the ancient material which\nafforded him a good view.",
    "He would watch events and any time he chose\ncould after all join the assembly modelling his behaviour on that of\nthe new arrival.",
    "The man who came up the staircase with a furtive softfooted tread was\nquite unknown to Tommy.",
    "He was obviously of the very dregs of society.",
    "The low beetling brows and the criminal jaw the bestiality of the\nwhole countenance were new to the young man though he was a type that\nScotland Yard would have recognized at a glance.",
    "The man passed the recess breathing heavily as he went.",
    "He stopped at\nthe door opposite and gave a repetition of the signal knock.",
    "A voice\ninside called out something and the man opened the door and passed in\naffording Tommy a momentary glimpse of the room inside.",
    "He thought there\nmust be about four or five people seated round a long table that took up\nmost of the space but his attention was caught and held by a tall man\nwith closecropped hair and a short pointed navallooking beard\nwho sat at the head of the table with papers in front of him.",
    "As the\nnewcomer entered he glanced up and with a correct but curiously\nprecise enunciation which attracted Tommy\u2019s notice he asked\n\n\u201cYour number comrade\u201d\n\n\u201cFourteen gov\u2019nor\u201d replied the other hoarsely.",
    "\u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nThe door shut again.",
    "\u201cIf that isn\u2019t a Hun I\u2019m a Dutchman\u201d said Tommy to himself.",

    "Lucky I\ndidn\u2019t roll in.",
    "I\u2019d have given the wrong number and there would have\nbeen the deuce to pay.",
    "No this is the place for me.",
    "Hullo here\u2019s\nanother knock.\u201d\n\nThis visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last.",
    "Tommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner.",
    "Certainly Mr. Brown\u2019s\norganization was a farreaching concern.",
    "The common criminal the\nwellbred Irish gentleman the pale Russian and the efficient German\nmaster of the ceremonies Truly a strange and sinister gathering Who\nwas this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of\nan unknown chain\n\nIn this case the procedure was exactly the same.",
    "The signal knock the\ndemand for a number and the reply \u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nTwo knocks followed in quick succession on the door below.",
    "The first man\nwas quite unknown to Tommy who put him down as a city clerk.",
    "A quiet\nintelligentlooking man rather shabbily dressed.",
    "The second was of the\nworking classes and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man.",
    "Three minutes later came another a man of commanding appearance\nexquisitely dressed and evidently well born.",
    "His face again was not\nunknown to the watcher though he could not for the moment put a name to\nit.",
    "After his arrival there was a long wait.",
    "In fact Tommy concluded that\nthe gathering was now complete and was just cautiously creeping out\nfrom his hidingplace when another knock sent him scuttling back to\ncover.",
    "This lastcomer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast\nof Tommy before the young man had realized his presence.",
    "He was a small man very pale with a gentle almost womanish air.",
    "The\nangle of the cheekbones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry otherwise\nthere was nothing to indicate his nationality.",
    "As he passed the recess\nhe turned his head slowly.",
    "The strange light eyes seemed to burn through\nthe curtain Tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was\nthere and in spite of himself he shivered.",
    "He was no more fanciful than\nthe majority of young Englishmen but he could not rid himself of the\nimpression that some unusually potent force emanated from the man.",
    "The\ncreature reminded him of a venomous snake.",
    "A moment later his impression was proved correct.",
    "The newcomer knocked\non the door as all had done but his reception was very different.",
    "The\nbearded man rose to his feet and all the others followed suit.",
    "The\nGerman came forward and shook hands.",
    "His heels clicked together.",
    "\u201cWe are honoured\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe are greatly honoured.",
    "I much feared that\nit would be impossible.\u201d\n\nThe other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it\n\n\u201cThere were difficulties.",
    "It will not be possible again I fear.",
    "But one\nmeeting is essentialto define my policy.",
    "I can do nothing withoutMr.",
    "Brown.",
    "He is here\u201d\n\nThe change in the German\u2019s voice was audible as he replied with slight\nhesitation\n\n\u201cWe have received a message.",
    "It is impossible for him to be present\nin person.\u201d He stopped giving a curious impression of having left the\nsentence unfinished.",
    "A very slow smile overspread the face of the other.",
    "He looked round at a\ncircle of uneasy faces.",
    "\u201cAh I understand.",
    "I have read of his methods.",
    "He works in the dark and\ntrusts no one.",
    "But all the same it is possible that he is among us\nnow....\u201d He looked round him again and again that expression of fear\nswept over the group.",
    "Each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully.",
    "The Russian tapped his cheek.",
    "\u201cSo be it.",
    "Let us proceed.\u201d\n\nThe German seemed to pull himself together.",
    "He indicated the place he\nhad been occupying at the head of the table.",
    "The Russian demurred but\nthe other insisted.",
    "\u201cIt is the only possible place\u201d he said \u201cforNumber One.",
    "Perhaps\nNumber Fourteen will shut the door\u201d\n\nIn another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels\nand the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable\nmurmur.",
    "Tommy became restive.",
    "The conversation he had overheard had\nstimulated his curiosity.",
    "He felt that by hook or by crook he must\nhear more.",
    "There was no sound from below and it did not seem likely that the\ndoorkeeper would come upstairs.",
    "After listening intently for a minute or\ntwo he put his head round the curtain.",
    "The passage was deserted.",
    "Tommy\nbent down and removed his shoes then leaving them behind the curtain\nhe walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet and kneeling down by\nthe closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack.",
    "To his intense\nannoyance he could distinguish little more just a chance word here and\nthere if a voice was raised which merely served to whet his curiosity\nstill farther.",
    "He eyed the handle of the door tentatively.",
    "Could he turn it by degrees\nso gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing\nHe decided that with great care it could be done.",
    "Very slowly a\nfraction of an inch at a time he moved it round holding his breath in\nhis excessive care.",
    "A little morea little more stillwould it never\nbe finished Ah at last it would turn no farther.",
    "He stayed so for a minute or two then drew a deep breath and pressed\nit ever so slightly inward.",
    "The door did not budge.",
    "Tommy was annoyed.",
    "If he had to use too much force it would almost certainly creak.",
    "He waited until the voices rose a little then he tried again.",
    "Still\nnothing happened.",
    "He increased the pressure.",
    "Had the beastly thing\nstuck Finally in desperation he pushed with all his might.",
    "But the\ndoor remained firm and at last the truth dawned upon him.",
    "It was locked\nor bolted on the inside.",
    "For a moment or two Tommy\u2019s indignation got the better of him.",
    "\u201cWell I\u2019m damned\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWhat a dirty trick\u201d\n\nAs his indignation cooled he prepared to face the situation.",
    "Clearly\nthe first thing to be done was to restore the handle to its original\nposition.",
    "If he let it go suddenly the men inside would be almost\ncertain to notice it so with the same infinite pains he reversed his\nformer tactics.",
    "All went well and with a sigh of relief the young man\nrose to his feet.",
    "There was a certain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that\nmade him slow to admit defeat.",
    "Checkmated for the moment he was far\nfrom abandoning the conflict.",
    "He still intended to hear what was going\non in the locked room.",
    "As one plan had failed he must hunt about for\nanother.",
    "He looked round him.",
    "A little farther along the passage on the left was\na second door.",
    "He slipped silently along to it.",
    "He listened for a moment\nor two then tried the handle.",
    "It yielded and he slipped inside.",
    "The room which was untenanted was furnished as a bedroom.",
    "Like\neverything else in the house the furniture was falling to pieces and\nthe dirt was if anything more abundant.",
    "But what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find a\ncommunicating door between the two rooms up on the left by the window.",
    "Carefully closing the door into the passage behind him he stepped\nacross to the other and examined it closely.",
    "The bolt was shot across\nit.",
    "It was very rusty and had clearly not been used for some time.",
    "By\ngently wriggling it to and fro Tommy managed to draw it back without\nmaking too much noise.",
    "Then he repeated his former man\u0153uvres with the\nhandlethis time with complete success.",
    "The door swung opena crack\na mere fraction but enough for Tommy to hear what went on.",
    "There was a\nvelvet porti\u00e8re on the inside of this door which prevented him from\nseeing but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount\nof accuracy.",
    "The Sinn Feiner was speaking.",
    "His rich Irish voice was unmistakable\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well.",
    "But more money is essential.",
    "No moneyno\nresults\u201d\n\nAnother voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris replied\n\n\u201cWill you guarantee that there are results\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a month from nowsooner or later as you wishI will guarantee you\nsuch a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake the British Empire to\nits foundations.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause and then came the soft sibilant accents of Number\nOne\n\n\u201cGood You shall have the money.",
    "Boris you will see to that.\u201d\n\nBoris asked a question\n\n\u201cVia the Irish Americans and Mr. Potter as usual\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019ll be all right\u201d said a new voice with a transatlantic\nintonation \u201cthough I\u2019d like to point out here and now that things\nare getting a mite difficult.",
    "There\u2019s not the sympathy there was and\na growing disposition to let the Irish settle their own affairs without\ninterference from America.\u201d\n\nTommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered\n\n\u201cDoes that matter since the money only nominally comes from the\nStates\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition\u201d said the Sinn\nFeiner.",
    "\u201cThe money is conveyed in easily enoughthanks to our colleague\nhere.\u201d\n\nAnother voice which Tommy fancied was that of the tall\ncommandinglooking man whose face had seemed familiar to him said\n\n\u201cThink of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is settled then\u201d said the sibilant tones.",
    "\u201cNow in the matter\nof the loan to an English newspaper you have arranged the details\nsatisfactorily Boris\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is good.",
    "An official denial from Moscow will be forthcoming if\nnecessary.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause and then the clear voice of the German broke the\nsilence\n\n\u201cI am directed byMr.",
    "Brown to place the summaries of the reports\nfrom the different unions before you.",
    "That of the miners is most\nsatisfactory.",
    "We must hold back the railways.",
    "There may be trouble with\nthe A.S.E.\u201d\n\nFor a long time there was a silence broken only by the rustle of papers\nand an occasional word of explanation from the German.",
    "Then Tommy heard\nthe light taptap of fingers drumming on the table.",
    "\u201cAndthe date my friend\u201d said Number One.",
    "\u201cThe 29th.\u201d\n\nThe Russian seemed to consider\n\n\u201cThat is rather soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.",
    "But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders and we\ncannot seem to interfere too much.",
    "They must believe it to be entirely\ntheir own show.\u201d\n\nThe Russian laughed softly as though amused.",
    "\u201cYes yes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThat is true.",
    "They must have no inkling that we\nare using them for our own ends.",
    "They are honest menand that is their\nvalue to us.",
    "It is curiousbut you cannot make a revolution without\nhonest men.",
    "The instinct of the populace is infallible.\u201d He paused and\nthen repeated as though the phrase pleased him \u201cEvery revolution has\nhad its honest men.",
    "They are soon disposed of afterwards.\u201d\n\nThere was a sinister note in his voice.",
    "The German resumed\n\n\u201cClymes must go.",
    "He is too farseeing.",
    "Number Fourteen will see to\nthat.\u201d\n\nThere was a hoarse murmur.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all right gov\u2019nor.\u201d And then after a moment or two \u201cSuppose\nI\u2019m nabbed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will have the best legal talent to defend you\u201d replied the\nGerman quietly.",
    "\u201cBut in any case you will wear gloves fitted with the\nfingerprints of a notorious housebreaker.",
    "You have little to fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I ain\u2019t afraid gov\u2019nor.",
    "All for the good of the cause.",
    "The streets\nis going to run with blood so they say.\u201d He spoke with a grim relish.",
    "\u201cDreams of it sometimes I does.",
    "And diamonds and pearls rolling about\nin the gutter for anyone to pick up\u201d\n\nTommy heard a chair shifted.",
    "Then Number One spoke\n\n\u201cThen all is arranged.",
    "We are assured of success\u201d\n\n\u201cIthink so.\u201d But the German spoke with less than his usual confidence.",
    "Number One\u2019s voice held suddenly a dangerous quality\n\n\u201cWhat has gone wrong\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing but\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Labour leaders.",
    "Without them as you say we can do nothing.",
    "If\nthey do not declare a general strike on the 29th\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should they not\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve said they\u2019re honest.",
    "And in spite of everything we\u2019ve\ndone to discredit the Government in their eyes I\u2019m not sure that they\nhaven\u2019t got a sneaking faith and belief in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.",
    "They abuse it unceasingly.",
    "But on the whole public opinion\nswings to the side of the Government.",
    "They will not go against it.\u201d\n\nAgain the Russian\u2019s fingers drummed on the table.",
    "\u201cTo the point my friend.",
    "I was given to understand that there was a\ncertain document in existence which assured success.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so.",
    "If that document were placed before the leaders the result\nwould be immediate.",
    "They would publish it broadcast throughout England\nand declare for the revolution without a moment\u2019s hesitation.",
    "The\nGovernment would be broken finally and completely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what more do you want\u201d\n\n\u201cThe document itself\u201d said the German bluntly.",
    "\u201cAh It is not in your possession But you know where it is\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes anyone know where it is\u201d\n\n\u201cOne personperhaps.",
    "And we are not sure of that even.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this person\u201d\n\n\u201cA girl.\u201d\n\nTommy held his breath.",
    "\u201cA girl\u201d The Russian\u2019s voice rose contemptuously.",
    "\u201cAnd you have not\nmade her speak In Russia we have ways of making a girl talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is different\u201d said the German sullenly.",
    "\u201cHowdifferent\u201d He paused a moment then went on \u201cWhere is the girl\nnow\u201d\n\n\u201cThe girl\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is\u201d\n\nBut Tommy heard no more.",
    "A crashing blow descended on his head and all\nwas darkness.",
    "CHAPTER IX.",
    "TUPPENCE ENTERS DOMESTIC SERVICE\n\nWHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men it took all Tuppence\u2019s\nselfcommand to refrain from accompanying him.",
    "However she contained\nherself as best she might consoled by the reflection that her reasoning\nhad been justified by events.",
    "The two men had undoubtedly come from the\nsecond floor flat and that one slender thread of the name \u201cRita\u201d had\nset the Young Adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of\nJane Finn.",
    "The question was what to do next Tuppence hated letting the grass grow\nunder her feet.",
    "Tommy was amply employed and debarred from joining him\nin the chase the girl felt at a loose end.",
    "She retraced her steps\nto the entrance hall of the mansions.",
    "It was now tenanted by a small\nliftboy who was polishing brass fittings and whistling the latest air\nwith a good deal of vigour and a reasonable amount of accuracy.",
    "He glanced round at Tuppence\u2019s entry.",
    "There was a certain amount of the\ngamin element in the girl at all events she invariably got on well\nwith small boys.",
    "A sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed.",
    "She\nreflected that an ally in the enemy\u2019s camp so to speak was not to be\ndespised.",

    "She glanced mysteriously round the hall.",
    "The effect was purposely a broad one in case Albert should miss it.",
    "She\nleaned towards the boy and dropped her voice \u201cI want a word with you\nAlbert.\u201d\n\nAlbert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth slightly.",
    "\u201cLook Do you know what this is\u201d With a dramatic gesture she flung back\nthe left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge.",
    "It was\nextremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of itindeed\nit would have been fatal for Tuppence\u2019s plans since the badge in\nquestion was the device of a local training corps originated by the\narchdeacon in the early days of the war.",
    "Its presence in Tuppence\u2019s coat\nwas due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a\nday or two before.",
    "But Tuppence had sharp eyes and had noted the corner\nof a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert\u2019s pocket and the\nimmediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good\nand that the fish would rise to the bait.",
    "\u201cAmerican Detective Force\u201d she hissed.",
    "Albert fell for it.",
    "\u201cLord\u201d he murmured ecstatically.",

    "Having dispatched this and\nTommy not having yet returnedwhich did not surprise hershe started\noff on a shopping expedition which with an interval for tea and\nassorted creamy cakes occupied her until well after six o\u2019clock and\nshe returned to the hotel jaded but satisfied with her purchases.",
    "Starting with a cheap clothing store and passing through one or two\nsecondhand establishments she had finished the day at a wellknown\nhairdresser\u2019s.",
    "Now in the seclusion of her bedroom she unwrapped\nthat final purchase.",
    "Five minutes later she smiled contentedly at her\nreflection in the glass.",
    "With an actress\u2019s pencil she had slightly\naltered the line of her eyebrows and that taken in conjunction with\nthe new luxuriant growth of fair hair above so changed her appearance\nthat she felt confident that even if she came face to face with\nWhittington he would not recognize her.",
    "She would wear elevators in her\nshoes and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise.",
    "From hospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of\nuniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Tuppence aloud nodding at the pert reflection in the glass\n\u201cyou\u2019ll do.\u201d She then resumed her normal appearance.",
    "Dinner was a solitary meal.",
    "Tuppence was rather surprised at Tommy\u2019s\nnonreturn.",
    "Julius too was absentbut that to the girl\u2019s mind was\nmore easily explained.",
    "His \u201chustling\u201d activities were not confined\nto London and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully\naccepted by the Young Adventurers as part of the day\u2019s work.",
    "It\nwas quite on the cards that Julius P. Hersheimmer had left for\nConstantinople at a moment\u2019s notice if he fancied that a clue to his\ncousin\u2019s disappearance was to be found there.",
    "The energetic young\nman had succeeded in making the lives of several Scotland Yard men\nunbearable to them and the telephone girls at the Admiralty had learned\nto know and dread the familiar \u201cHullo\u201d He had spent three hours in\nParis hustling the Prefecture and had returned from there imbued with\nthe idea possibly inspired by a weary French official that the true\nclue to the mystery was to be found in Ireland.",
    "\u201cI dare say he\u2019s dashed off there now\u201d thought Tuppence.",
    "\u201cAll very\nwell but this is very dull for me Here I am bursting with news and\nabsolutely no one to tell it to Tommy might have wired or something.",
    "I\nwonder where he is.",
    "Anyway he can\u2019t have \u2018lost the trail\u2019 as they say.",
    "That reminds me\u201d And Miss Cowley broke off in her meditations and\nsummoned a small boy.",
    "Ten minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed\nsmoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of Garnaby Williams the Boy\nDetective which with other threepenny works of lurid fiction she had\nsent out to purchase.",
    "She felt and rightly that before the strain\nof attempting further intercourse with Albert it would be as well to\nfortify herself with a good supply of local colour.",
    "The morning brought a note from Mr. Carter\n\n\u201cDEAR MISS TUPPENCE\n\n\u201cYou have made a splendid start and I congratulate you.",
    "I feel though\nthat I should like to point out to you once more the risks you are\nrunning especially if you pursue the course you indicate.",
    "Those people\nare absolutely desperate and incapable of either mercy or pity.",
    "I feel\nthat you probably underestimate the danger and therefore warn you\nagain that I can promise you no protection.",
    "You have given us valuable\ninformation and if you choose to withdraw now no one could blame you.",
    "At any rate think the matter over well before you decide.",
    "\u201cIf in spite of my warnings you make up your mind to go through with\nit you will find everything arranged.",
    "You have lived for two years with\nMiss Dufferin The Parsonage Llanelly and Mrs. Vandemeyer can apply to\nher for a reference.",
    "\u201cMay I be permitted a word or two of advice Stick as near to the truth\nas possibleit minimizes the danger of \u2018slips.\u2019 I suggest that you\nshould represent yourself to be what you are a former V.A.D.",

    "CARTER.\u201d\n\nTuppence\u2019s spirits rose mercurially.",
    "Mr. Carter\u2019s warnings passed\nunheeded.",
    "The young lady had far too much confidence in herself to pay\nany heed to them.",
    "With some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had sketched\nout for herself.",
    "Although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain\na role indefinitely she had too much common sense not to recognize the\nforce of Mr. Carter\u2019s arguments.",
    "There was still no word or message from Tommy but the morning post\nbrought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.\u201d scrawled\nupon it.",
    "At tenthirty Tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered tin trunk\ncontaining her new possessions.",
    "It was artistically corded.",
    "It was with\na slight blush that she rang the bell and ordered it to be placed in a\ntaxi.",
    "She drove to Paddington and left the box in the cloak room.",
    "She then repaired with a handbag to the fastnesses of the ladies\u2019\nwaitingroom.",
    "Ten minutes later a metamorphosed Tuppence walked demurely\nout of the station and entered a bus.",
    "It was a few minutes past eleven when Tuppence again entered the hall\nof South Audley Mansions.",
    "Albert was on the lookout attending to his\nduties in a somewhat desultory fashion.",
    "He did not immediately recognize\nTuppence.",
    "When he did his admiration was unbounded.",
    "\u201cBlest if I\u2019d have known you That rigout\u2019s tophole.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad you like it Albert\u201d replied Tuppence modestly.",
    "\u201cBy the way am I\nyour cousin or am I not\u201d\n\n\u201cYour voice too\u201d cried the delighted boy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s as English as anything\nNo I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal.",

    "She\u2019s stopped on till todayto oblige she said but really\nit\u2019s so as to put you against the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice girl\u201d said Tuppence.",

    "Are you going up now miss Step inside the\nlift.",
    "No.",

    "I can tell you\u201d\n\nBut what more Annie could tell Tuppence was never destined to learn\nfor at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely ring to it\ncalled\n\n\u201cAnnie\u201d\n\nThe smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot.",
    "\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you talking to\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a young woman about the situation ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow her in then.",
    "At once.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nTuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage.",
    "A\nwoman was standing by the fireplace.",
    "She was no longer in her first\nyouth and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and\ncoarsened.",
    "In her youth she must have been dazzling.",
    "Her pale gold hair\nowing a slight assistance to art was coiled low on her neck her eyes\nof a piercing electric blue seemed to possess a faculty of boring into\nthe very soul of the person she was looking at.",
    "Her exquisite figure was\nenhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse.",
    "And yet despite her\nswaying grace and the almost ethereal beauty of her face you felt\ninstinctively the presence of something hard and menacing a kind of\nmetallic strength that found expression in the tones of her voice and in\nthat gimletlike quality of her eyes.",
    "For the first time Tuppence felt afraid.",
    "She had not feared Whittington\nbut this woman was different.",
    "As if fascinated she watched the long\ncruel line of the red curving mouth and again she felt that sensation\nof panic pass over her.",
    "Her usual selfconfidence deserted her.",
    "Vaguely\nshe felt that deceiving this woman would be very different to deceiving\nWhittington.",
    "Mr. Carter\u2019s warning recurred to her mind.",
    "Here indeed\nshe might expect no mercy.",
    "Fighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail and\nrun without further delay Tuppence returned the lady\u2019s gaze firmly and\nrespectfully.",
    "As though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory Mrs. Vandemeyer\nmotioned to a chair.",
    "\u201cYou can sit down.",
    "How did you hear I wanted a houseparlourmaid\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough a friend who knows the lift boy here.",
    "He thought the place\nmight suit me.\u201d\n\nAgain that basilisk glance seemed to pierce her through.",
    "\u201cYou speak like an educated girl\u201d\n\nGlibly enough Tuppence ran through her imaginary career on the lines\nsuggested by Mr. Carter.",
    "It seemed to her as she did so that the\ntension of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s attitude relaxed.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d she remarked at length.",
    "\u201cIs there anyone I can write to for a\nreference\u201d\n\n\u201cI lived last with a Miss Dufferin The Parsonage Llanelly.",
    "I was with\nher two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then you thought you would get more money by coming to London\nI suppose Well it doesn\u2019t matter to me.",
    "I will give you\n\u00a350\u00a360whatever you want.",
    "You can come in at once\u201d\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.",
    "Today if you like.",
    "My box is at Paddington.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo and fetch it in a taxi then.",
    "It\u2019s an easy place.",
    "I am out a good\ndeal.",

    "The cook will show you where everything is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nTuppence withdrew.",
    "The smart Annie was not in evidence.",
    "In the hall\nbelow a magnificent hall porter had relegated Albert to the background.",
    "Tuppence did not even glance at him as she passed meekly out.",
    "The adventure had begun but she felt less elated than she had done\nearlier in the morning.",
    "It crossed her mind that if the unknown Jane\nFinn had fallen into the hands of Mrs. Vandemeyer it was likely to have\ngone hard with her.",
    "CHAPTER X.",
    "ENTER SIR JAMES PEEL EDGERTON\n\nTUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties.",
    "The daughters of the\narchdeacon were well grounded in household tasks.",
    "They were also experts\nin training a \u201craw girl\u201d the inevitable result being that the raw girl\nonce trained departed elsewhere where her newly acquired knowledge\ncommanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacon\u2019s meagre\npurse allowed.",
    "Tuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient.",
    "Mrs.\nVandemeyer\u2019s cook puzzled her.",
    "She evidently went in deadly terror of\nher mistress.",
    "The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some\nhold over her.",
    "For the rest she cooked like a chef as Tuppence had\nan opportunity of judging that evening.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a\nguest to dinner and Tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished\ntable for two.",
    "She was a little exercised in her own mind as to this\nvisitor.",
    "It was highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington.",
    "Although she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her yet\nshe would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total\nstranger.",
    "However there was nothing for it but to hope for the best.",
    "At a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang and Tuppence went\nto answer it with some inward trepidation.",
    "She was relieved to see that\nthe visitor was the second of the two men whom Tommy had taken upon\nhimself to follow.",
    "He gave his name as Count Stepanov.",
    "Tuppence announced him and Mrs.\nVandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick murmur of\npleasure.",
    "\u201cIt is delightful to see you Boris Ivanovitch\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cAnd you madame\u201d He bowed low over her hand.",
    "Tuppence returned to the kitchen.",
    "\u201cCount Stepanov or some such\u201d she remarked and affecting a frank and\nunvarnished curiosity \u201cWho\u2019s he\u201d\n\n\u201cA Russian gentleman I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here much\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce in a while.",
    "What d\u2019you want to know for\u201d\n\n\u201cFancied he might be sweet on the missus that\u2019s all\u201d explained the\ngirl adding with an appearance of sulkiness \u201cHow you do take one up\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite easy in my mind about the souffl\u00e9\u201d explained the\nother.",
    "\u201cYou know something\u201d thought Tuppence to herself but aloud she only\nsaid \u201cGoing to dish up now Righto.\u201d\n\nWhilst waiting at table Tuppence listened closely to all that was said.",
    "She remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was shadowing when she\nhad last seen him.",
    "Already although she would hardly admit it she was\nbecoming uneasy about her partner.",
    "Where was he Why had no word of any\nkind come from him She had arranged before leaving the Ritz to have\nall letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small\nstationer\u2019s shop near at hand where Albert was to call in frequently.",
    "True it was only yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy and\nshe told herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd.",
    "Still\nit was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.",
    "But listen as she might the conversation presented no clue.",
    "Boris and\nMrs. Vandemeyer talked on purely indifferent subjects plays they had\nseen new dances and the latest society gossip.",
    "After dinner they\nrepaired to the small boudoir where Mrs. Vandemeyer stretched on the\ndivan looked more wickedly beautiful than ever.",
    "Tuppence brought in the\ncoffee and liqueurs and unwillingly retired.",
    "As she did so she heard\nBoris say\n\n\u201cNew isn\u2019t she\u201d\n\n\u201cShe came in today.",
    "The other was a fiend.",
    "This girl seems all right.",
    "She waits well.\u201d\n\nTuppence lingered a moment longer by the door which she had carefully\nneglected to close and heard him say\n\n\u201cQuite safe I suppose\u201d\n\n\u201cReally Boris you are absurdly suspicious.",
    "I believe she\u2019s the cousin\nof the hall porter or something of the kind.",
    "And nobody even dreams\nthat I have any connection with ourmutual friend Mr. Brown.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake be careful Rita.",
    "That door isn\u2019t shut.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell shut it then\u201d laughed the woman.",
    "Tuppence removed herself speedily.",
    "She dared not absent herself longer from the back premises but she\ncleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired in hospital.",
    "Then she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door.",
    "The cook more\nleisurely was still busy in the kitchen and if she missed the other\nwould only suppose her to be turning down the beds.",
    "Alas The conversation inside was being carried on in too low a tone\nto permit of her hearing anything of it.",
    "She dared not reopen the\ndoor however gently.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer was sitting almost facing it and\nTuppence respected her mistress\u2019s lynxeyed powers of observation.",
    "Nevertheless she felt she would give a good deal to overhear what was\ngoing on.",
    "Possibly if anything unforeseen had happened she might get\nnews of Tommy.",
    "For some moments she reflected desperately then her\nface brightened.",
    "She went quickly along the passage to Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s\nbedroom which had long French windows leading on to a balcony that ran\nthe length of the flat.",
    "Slipping quickly through the window Tuppence\ncrept noiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window.",
    "As she\nhad thought it stood a little ajar and the voices within were plainly\naudible.",
    "Tuppence listened attentively but there was no mention of anything\nthat could be twisted to apply to Tommy.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer and the Russian\nseemed to be at variance over some matter and finally the latter\nexclaimed bitterly\n\n\u201cWith your persistent recklessness you will end by ruining us\u201d\n\n\u201cBah\u201d laughed the woman.",
    "\u201cNotoriety of the right kind is the best way\nof disarming suspicion.",
    "You will realize that one of these daysperhaps\nsooner than you think\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the meantime you are going about everywhere with Peel Edgerton.",
    "Not only is he perhaps the most celebrated K.C.",
    "in England but his\nspecial hobby is criminology It is madness\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that his eloquence has saved untold men from the gallows\u201d said\nMrs. Vandemeyer calmly.",
    "\u201cWhat of it I may need his assistance in that\nline myself some day.",
    "If so how fortunate to have such a friend at\ncourtor perhaps it would be more to the point to say in court.\u201d\n\nBoris got up and began striding up and down.",
    "He was very excited.",
    "\u201cYou are a clever woman Rita but you are also a fool Be guided by me\nand give up Peel Edgerton.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head gently.",
    "\u201cI think not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou refuse\u201d There was an ugly ring in the Russian\u2019s voice.",
    "\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen by Heaven\u201d snarled the Russian \u201cwe will see\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Vandemeyer also rose to her feet her eyes flashing.",
    "\u201cYou forget Boris\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI am accountable to no one.",
    "I take my\norders only fromMr.",
    "Brown.\u201d\n\nThe other threw up his hands in despair.",
    "\u201cYou are impossible\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cImpossible Already it may be too\nlate.",
    "They say Peel Edgerton can smell a criminal How do we know what\nis at the bottom of his sudden interest in you Perhaps even now his\nsuspicions are aroused.",
    "He guesses\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer eyed him scornfully.",
    "\u201cReassure yourself my dear Boris.",
    "He suspects nothing.",
    "With less than\nyour usual chivalry you seem to forget that I am commonly accounted a\nbeautiful woman.",
    "I assure you that is all that interests Peel Edgerton.\u201d\n\nBoris shook his head doubtfully.",
    "\u201cHe has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied it.",
    "Do\nyou fancy that you can deceive him\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s eyes narrowed.",
    "\u201cIf he is all that you sayit would amuse me to try\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens Rita\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides\u201d added Mrs. Vandemeyer \u201che is extremely rich.",

    "I believe you\nwould sell your soul for money.",
    "I believe\u201d He paused then in a\nlow sinister voice he said slowly \u201cSometimes I believe that you would\nsell us\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled and shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cThe price at any rate would have to be enormous\u201d she said lightly.",
    "\u201cIt would be beyond the power of anyone but a millionaire to pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d snarled the Russian.",
    "\u201cYou see I was right\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Boris can you not take a joke\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it a joke\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen all I can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar my dear\nRita.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled.",
    "\u201cLet us not quarrel Boris.",
    "Touch the bell.",
    "We will have some drinks.\u201d\n\nTuppence beat a hasty retreat.",
    "She paused a moment to survey herself in\nMrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s long glass and be sure that nothing was amiss with\nher appearance.",
    "Then she answered the bell demurely.",
    "The conversation that she had overheard although interesting in that\nit proved beyond doubt the complicity of both Rita and Boris threw very\nlittle light on the present preoccupations.",
    "The name of Jane Finn had\nnot even been mentioned.",
    "The following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her that\nnothing was waiting for her at the stationer\u2019s.",
    "It seemed incredible\nthat Tommy if all was well with him should not send any word to her.",
    "A cold hand seemed to close round her heart.... Supposing.... She choked\nher fears down bravely.",
    "It was no good worrying.",
    "But she leapt at a\nchance offered her by Mrs. Vandemeyer.",
    "\u201cWhat day do you usually go out Prudence\u201d\n\n\u201cFriday\u2019s my usual day ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows.",
    "\u201cAnd today is Friday But I suppose you hardly wish to go out today\nas you only came yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking of asking you if I might ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer and then smiled.",
    "\u201cI wish Count Stepanov could hear you.",
    "He made a suggestion about\nyou last night.\u201d Her smile broadened catlike.",
    "\u201cYour request is\nverytypical.",
    "I am satisfied.",
    "You do not understand all thisbut\nyou can go out today.",
    "It makes no difference to me as I shall not be\ndining at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nTuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the other\u2019s\npresence.",
    "Once again she admitted to herself that she was afraid\nhorribly afraid of the beautiful woman with the cruel eyes.",
    "In the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver Tuppence was\ndisturbed by the ringing of the front door bell and went to answer it.",
    "This time the visitor was neither Whittington nor Boris but a man of\nstriking appearance.",
    "Just a shade over average height he nevertheless conveyed the\nimpression of a big man.",
    "His face cleanshaven and exquisitely mobile\nwas stamped with an expression of power and force far beyond the\nordinary.",
    "Magnetism seemed to radiate from him.",
    "Tuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as an\nactor or a lawyer but her doubts were soon solved as he gave her his\nname Sir James Peel Edgerton.",
    "She looked at him with renewed interest.",
    "This then was the famous K.C.",
    "whose name was familiar all over England.",
    "She had heard it said that he\nmight one day be Prime Minister.",
    "He was known to have refused office in\nthe interests of his profession preferring to remain a simple Member\nfor a Scotch constituency.",
    "Tuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully.",
    "The great man had\nimpressed her.",
    "She understood Boris\u2019s agitation.",
    "Peel Edgerton would not\nbe an easy man to deceive.",
    "In about a quarter of an hour the bell rang and Tuppence repaired to\nthe hall to show the visitor out.",
    "He had given her a piercing glance\nbefore.",

    "As she opened the door and stood aside to\nlet him pass out he stopped in the doorway.",
    "\u201cNot been doing this long eh\u201d\n\nTuppence raised her eyes astonished.",

    "But Sir James was already on the topmost stair.",

    "\u201cJust a hint\u201d he said.",

    "Satisfied\non this point she made her way to the Ritz.",
    "On inquiry she learnt\nthat Tommy had not yet returned.",
    "It was the answer she had expected but\nit was another nail in the coffin of her hopes.",
    "She resolved to appeal\nto Mr. Carter telling him when and where Tommy had started on his\nquest and asking him to do something to trace him.",
    "The prospect of\nhis aid revived her mercurial spirits and she next inquired for Julius\nHersheimmer.",
    "The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned\nabout half an hour ago but had gone out immediately.",
    "Tuppence\u2019s spirits revived still more.",
    "It would be something to see\nJulius.",

    "\u201cYou don\u2019t know where he is\u201d she asked faintly.",
    "\u201cI How should I know I haven\u2019t had one darned word from him though I\nwired him yesterday morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect your wire\u2019s at the office unopened.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where is he\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.",

    "I handed him out half a dollar and that settled\nthat.",

    "Whittington was there right enough.",
    "When I saw the skunk with his big\nsleek fat face and thought of poor little Jane in his clutches I felt\nreal mad that I hadn\u2019t got a gun with me.",
    "I\u2019d have tickled him up some.",
    "\u201cWe got to Bournemouth all right.",
    "Whittington took a cab and gave the\nname of an hotel.",
    "I did likewise and we drove up within three minutes\nof each other.",
    "He hired a room and I hired one too.",
    "So far it was all\nplain sailing.",
    "He hadn\u2019t the remotest notion that anyone was on to him.",
    "Well he just sat around in the hotel lounge reading the papers and so\non till it was time for dinner.",
    "He didn\u2019t hurry any over that either.",
    "\u201cI began to think that there was nothing doing that he\u2019d just come on\nthe trip for his health but I remembered that he hadn\u2019t changed for\ndinner though it was by way of being a slapup hotel so it seemed\nlikely enough that he\u2019d be going out on his real business afterwards.",
    "\u201cSure enough about nine o\u2019clock so he did.",
    "Took a car across the\ntownmighty pretty place by the way I guess I\u2019ll take Jane there for\na spell when I find herand then paid it off and struck out along those\npinewoods on the top of the cliff.",
    "I was there too you understand.",
    "We walked maybe for half an hour.",
    "There\u2019s a lot of villas all the way\nalong but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out and\nin the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch.",
    "Big house it\nwas with a lot of piny grounds around it.",
    "\u201cIt was a pretty black night and the carriage drive up to the house was\ndark as pitch.",
    "I could hear him ahead though I couldn\u2019t see him.",
    "I\nhad to walk carefully in case he might get on to it that he was being\nfollowed.",
    "I turned a curve and I was just in time to see him ring the\nbell and get admitted to the house.",
    "I just stopped where I was.",
    "It was\nbeginning to rain and I was soon pretty near soaked through.",
    "Also it\nwas almighty cold.",
    "\u201cWhittington didn\u2019t come out again and by and by I got kind of restive\nand began to mouch around.",
    "All the ground floor windows were shuttered\ntight but upstairs on the first floor it was a twostoried house I\nnoticed a window with a light burning and the curtains not drawn.",
    "\u201cNow just opposite to that window there was a tree growing.",
    "It was\nabout thirty foot away from the house maybe and I sort of got it into\nmy head that if I climbed up that tree I\u2019d very likely be able to see\ninto that room.",
    "Of course I knew there was no reason why Whittington\nshould be in that room rather than in any otherless reason in fact\nfor the betting would be on his being in one of the receptionrooms\ndownstairs.",
    "But I guess I\u2019d got the hump from standing so long in the\nrain and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing.",
    "So I\nstarted up.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so easy by a long chalk The rain had made the boughs mighty\nslippery and it was all I could do to keep a foothold but bit by bit I\nmanaged it until at last there I was level with the window.",
    "\u201cBut then I was disappointed.",
    "I was too far to the left.",
    "I could only\nsee sideways into the room.",
    "A bit of curtain and a yard of wallpaper\nwas all I could command.",
    "Well that wasn\u2019t any manner of good to me but\njust as I was going to give it up and climb down ignominiously some\none inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of walland by\ngum it was Whittington\n\n\u201cAfter that my blood was up.",
    "I\u2019d just got to get a look into that\nroom.",
    "It was up to me to figure out how.",
    "I noticed that there was a long\nbranch running out from the tree in the right direction.",
    "If I could only\nswarm about halfway along it the proposition would be solved.",
    "But it\nwas mighty uncertain whether it would bear my weight.",
    "I decided I\u2019d\njust got to risk that and I started.",
    "Very cautiously inch by inch I\ncrawled along.",
    "The bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion and it\ndidn\u2019t do to think of the drop below but at last I got safely to where\nI wanted to be.",
    "\u201cThe room was mediumsized furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way.",
    "There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room and\nsitting at that table facing towards me was Whittington right enough.",
    "He was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse.",
    "She was sitting\nwith her back to me so I couldn\u2019t see her face.",
    "Although the blinds\nwere up the window itself was shut so I couldn\u2019t catch a word of what\nthey said.",
    "Whittington seemed to be doing all the talking and the nurse\njust listened.",
    "Now and then she nodded and sometimes she\u2019d shake\nher head as though she were answering questions.",
    "He seemed very\nemphaticonce or twice he beat with his fist on the table.",
    "The rain had\nstopped now and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does.",
    "\u201cPresently he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying.",
    "He got\nup and so did she.",
    "He looked towards the window and asked somethingI\nguess it was whether it was raining.",
    "Anyway she came right across and\nlooked out.",
    "Just then the moon came out from behind the clouds.",
    "I\nwas scared the woman would catch sight of me for I was full in the\nmoonlight.",
    "I tried to move back a bit.",
    "The jerk I gave was too much for\nthat rotten old branch.",
    "With an almighty crash down it came and Julius\nP. Hersheimmer with it\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Julius\u201d breathed Tuppence \u201chow exciting Go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell luckily for me I pitched down into a good soft bed of earthbut\nit put me out of action for the time sure enough.",
    "The next thing I\nknew I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse not Whittington\u2019s one\non one side of me and a little blackbearded man with gold glasses\nand medical man written all over him on the other.",
    "He rubbed his hands\ntogether and raised his eyebrows as I stared at him.",
    "\u2018Ah\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018So\nour young friend is coming round again.",
    "Capital.",
    "Capital.\u2019\n\n\u201cI did the usual stunt.",
    "Said \u2018What\u2019s happened\u2019 And \u2018Where am I\u2019 But\nI knew the answer to the last well enough.",
    "There\u2019s no moss growing on\nmy brain.",
    "\u2018I think that\u2019ll do for the present sister\u2019 said the little\nman and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk welltrained way.",
    "But I caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed\nthrough the door.",
    "\u201cThat look of hers gave me an idea.",
    "\u2018Now then doc\u2019 I said and tried\nto sit up in bed but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge as I did so.",
    "\u2018A slight sprain\u2019 explained the doctor.",
    "\u2018Nothing serious.",
    "You\u2019ll be\nabout again in a couple of days.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI noticed you walked lame\u201d interpolated Tuppence.",
    "Julius nodded and continued\n\n\u201c\u2018How did it happen\u2019 I asked again.",
    "He replied dryly.",
    "\u2018You fell with\na considerable portion of one of my trees into one of my newly planted\nflowerbeds.\u2019\n\n\u201cI liked the man.",
    "He seemed to have a sense of humour.",
    "I felt sure that\nhe at least was plumb straight.",
    "\u2018Sure doc\u2019 I said \u2018I\u2019m sorry about\nthe tree and I guess the new bulbs will be on me.",
    "But perhaps you\u2019d\nlike to know what I was doing in your garden\u2019 \u2018I think the facts do\ncall for an explanation\u2019 he replied.",
    "\u2018Well to begin with I wasn\u2019t\nafter the spoons.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe smiled.",
    "\u2018My first theory.",
    "But I soon altered my mind.",
    "By the way\nyou are an American are you not\u2019 I told him my name.",
    "\u2018And you\u2019 \u2018I am\nDr. Hall and this as you doubtless know is my private nursing home.\u2019\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know but I wasn\u2019t going to put him wise.",
    "I was just thankful\nfor the information.",
    "I liked the man and I felt he was straight but\nI wasn\u2019t going to give him the whole story.",
    "For one thing he probably\nwouldn\u2019t have believed it.",
    "\u201cI made up my mind in a flash.",
    "\u2018Why doctor\u2019 I said \u2018I guess I feel\nan almighty fool but I owe it to you to let you know that it wasn\u2019t\nthe Bill Sikes business I was up to.\u2019 Then I went on and mumbled out\nsomething about a girl.",
    "I trotted out the stern guardian business and a\nnervous breakdown and finally explained that I had fancied I recognized\nher among the patients at the home hence my nocturnal adventures.",
    "I\nguess it was just the kind of story he was expecting.",
    "\u2018Quite a romance\u2019\nhe said genially when I\u2019d finished.",

    "It is an uncommon name and I should not have been\nlikely to forget it.\u2019\n\n\u201cWell that was flat.",

    "Of course if the girl\nwas really Whittington\u2019s niece she might be too cute to fall into the\ntrap but it was worth trying.",
    "Next thing I did was to write out a wire\nto Beresford saying where I was and that I was laid up with a sprained\nfoot and telling him to come down if he wasn\u2019t busy.",
    "I had to be\nguarded in what I said.",
    "However I didn\u2019t hear from him and my foot\nsoon got all right.",

    "That\nguy couldn\u2019t help us any.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I believe he could\u201d reiterated Tuppence obstinately.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you think it.",
    "So long.",
    "I\u2019ll be back in half an hour.\u201d\n\nThirtyfive minutes had elapsed when Julius returned.",
    "He took Tuppence\nby the arm and walked her to the window.",
    "\u201cThere she is.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d said Tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice as she gazed\ndown at the enormous car.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s some pacemaker I can tell you\u201d said Julius complacently.",
    "\u201cHow did you get it\u201d gasped Tuppence.",
    "\u201cShe was just being sent home to some bigwig.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\n\u201cI went round to his house\u201d said Julius.",
    "\u201cI said that I reckoned a car\nlike that was worth every penny of twenty thousand dollars.",
    "Then I told\nhim that it was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if he\u2019d\nget out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Tuppence intoxicated.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d returned Julius \u201che got out that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.",
    "A FRIEND IN NEED\n\nFRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully.",
    "Tuppence had received a brief\nanswer to her appeal from Mr. Carter.",
    "In it he pointed out that the\nYoung Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk and had\nbeen fully warned of the dangers.",
    "If anything had happened to Tommy he\nregretted it deeply but he could do nothing.",
    "This was cold comfort.",
    "Somehow without Tommy all the savour went out\nof the adventure and for the first time Tuppence felt doubtful of\nsuccess.",
    "While they had been together she had never questioned it for\na minute.",
    "Although she was accustomed to take the lead and to pride\nherself on her quickwittedness in reality she had relied upon Tommy\nmore than she realized at the time.",
    "There was something so eminently\nsober and clearheaded about him his common sense and soundness of\nvision were so unvarying that without him Tuppence felt much like a\nrudderless ship.",
    "It was curious that Julius who was undoubtedly much\ncleverer than Tommy did not give her the same feeling of support.",
    "She\nhad accused Tommy of being a pessimist and it is certain that he\nalways saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was\noptimistically given to overlooking but nevertheless she had really\nrelied a good deal on his judgment.",
    "He might be slow but he was very\nsure.",
    "It seemed to the girl that for the first time she realized the\nsinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly.",
    "It had begun like a page of romance.",
    "Now shorn of its glamour it\nseemed to be turning to grim reality.",
    "Tommythat was all that mattered.",
    "Many times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes\nresolutely.",
    "\u201cLittle fool\u201d she would apostrophize herself \u201cdon\u2019t\nsnivel.",
    "Of course you\u2019re fond of him.",
    "You\u2019ve known him all your life.",
    "But there\u2019s no need to be sentimental about it.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime nothing more was seen of Boris.",
    "He did not come to the\nflat and Julius and the car waited in vain.",
    "Tuppence gave herself over\nto new meditations.",
    "Whilst admitting the truth of Julius\u2019s objections\nshe had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to\nSir James Peel Edgerton.",
    "Indeed she had gone so far as to look up his\naddress in the Red Book.",
    "Had he meant to warn her that day If so\nwhy Surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation.",
    "He had\nlooked at her so kindly.",
    "Perhaps he might tell them something concerning\nMrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy\u2019s whereabouts.",
    "Anyway Tuppence decided with her usual shake of the shoulders it was\nworth trying and try it she would.",
    "Sunday was her afternoon out.",
    "She\nwould meet Julius persuade him to her point of view and they would\nbeard the lion in his den.",
    "When the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading\nbut Tuppence held firm.",
    "\u201cIt can do no harm\u201d was what she always came\nback to.",
    "In the end Julius gave in and they proceeded in the car to\nCarlton House Terrace.",
    "The door was opened by an irreproachable butler.",
    "Tuppence felt a little\nnervous.",
    "After all perhaps it was colossal cheek on her part.",
    "She\nhad decided not to ask if Sir James was \u201cat home\u201d but to adopt a more\npersonal attitude.",
    "\u201cWill you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes I have an\nimportant message for him.\u201d\n\nThe butler retired returning a moment or two later.",
    "\u201cSir James will see you.",
    "Will you step this way\u201d\n\nHe ushered them into a room at the back of the house furnished as a\nlibrary.",
    "The collection of books was a magnificent one and Tuppence\nnoticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology.",
    "There were several deeppadded leather armchairs and an oldfashioned\nopen hearth.",
    "In the window was a big rolltop desk strewn with papers at\nwhich the master of the house was sitting.",
    "He rose as they entered.",
    "\u201cYou have a message for me Ah\u201dhe recognized Tuppence with a\nsmile\u201cit\u2019s you is it Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer I\nsuppose\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIn fact I\u2019m afraid I only said that to\nbe quite sure of getting in.",
    "Oh by the way this is Mr. Hersheimmer\nSir James Peel Edgerton.\u201d\n\n\u201cPleased to meet you\u201d said the American shooting out a hand.",
    "\u201cWon\u2019t you both sit down\u201d asked Sir James.",
    "He drew forward two chairs.",
    "\u201cSir James\u201d said Tuppence plunging boldly \u201cI dare say you will think\nit is most awful cheek of me coming here like this.",
    "Because of course\nit\u2019s nothing whatever to do with you and then you\u2019re a very important\nperson and of course Tommy and I are very unimportant.\u201d She paused for\nbreath.",
    "\u201cTommy\u201d queried Sir James looking across at the American.",
    "\u201cNo that\u2019s Julius\u201d explained Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m rather nervous and that\nmakes me tell it badly.",
    "What I really want to know is what you meant by\nwhat you said to me the other day Did you mean to warn me against Mrs.\nVandemeyer You did didn\u2019t you\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear young lady as far as I recollect I only mentioned that there\nwere equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I know.",
    "But it was a hint wasn\u2019t it\u201d\n\n\u201cWell perhaps it was\u201d admitted Sir James gravely.",
    "\u201cWell I want to know more.",
    "I want to know just why you gave me a\nhint.\u201d\n\nSir James smiled at her earnestness.",
    "\u201cSuppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of\ncharacter\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI know lawyers are always dreadfully\ncareful.",
    "But can\u2019t we say \u2018without prejudice\u2019 first and then say just\nwhat we want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Sir James still smiling \u201cwithout prejudice then if I\nhad a young sister forced to earn her living I should not like to see\nher in Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s service.",
    "I felt it incumbent on me just to give\nyou a hint.",
    "It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl.",
    "That is\nall I can tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThank you very much.",
    "But I\u2019m not\nreally inexperienced you know.",
    "I knew perfectly that she was a bad\nlot when I went thereas a matter of fact that\u2019s why I went\u201d She\nbroke off seeing some bewilderment on the lawyer\u2019s face and went on\n\u201cI think perhaps I\u2019d better tell you the whole story Sir James.",
    "I\u2019ve a\nsort of feeling that you\u2019d know in a minute if I didn\u2019t tell the truth\nand so you might as well know all about it from the beginning.",
    "What do\nyou think Julius\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019re bent on it I\u2019d go right ahead with the facts\u201d replied the\nAmerican who had so far sat in silence.",
    "\u201cYes tell me all about it\u201d said Sir James.",
    "\u201cI want to know who Tommy\nis.\u201d\n\nThus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale and the lawyer listened\nwith close attention.",
    "\u201cVery interesting\u201d he said when she finished.",
    "\u201cA great deal of what\nyou tell me child is already known to me.",
    "I\u2019ve had certain theories\nof my own about this Jane Finn.",
    "You\u2019ve done extraordinarily well so\nfar but it\u2019s rather too bad ofwhat do you know him asMr.",
    "Carter to\npitchfork you two young things into an affair of this kind.",
    "By the\nway where did Mr. Hersheimmer come in originally You didn\u2019t make that\nclear\u201d\n\nJulius answered for himself.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m Jane\u2019s first cousin\u201d he explained returning the lawyer\u2019s keen\ngaze.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Sir James\u201d broke out Tuppence \u201cwhat do you think has become of\nTommy\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m.\u201d The lawyer rose and paced slowly up and down.",
    "\u201cWhen you arrived\nyoung lady I was just packing up my traps.",
    "Going to Scotland by the\nnight train for a few days\u2019 fishing.",
    "But there are different kinds of\nfishing.",
    "I\u2019ve a good mind to stay and see if we can\u2019t get on the track\nof that young chap.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically.",
    "\u201cAll the same as I said before it\u2019s too bad ofof Carter to set you\ntwo babies on a job like this.",
    "Now don\u2019t get offended Misser\u201d\n\n\u201cCowley.",
    "Prudence Cowley.",
    "But my friends call me Tuppence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell Miss Tuppence then as I\u2019m certainly going to be a friend.",
    "Don\u2019t\nbe offended because I think you\u2019re young.",
    "Youth is a failing only too\neasily outgrown.",
    "Now about this young Tommy of yours\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tuppence clasped her hands.",
    "\u201cFrankly things look bad for him.",
    "He\u2019s been butting in somewhere where\nhe wasn\u2019t wanted.",
    "Not a doubt of it.",
    "But don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you really will help us There Julius He didn\u2019t want me to come\u201d\n she added by way of explanation.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said the lawyer favouring Julius with another keen glance.",
    "\u201cAnd\nwhy was that\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little\nbusiness like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d He paused a moment.",
    "\u201cThis petty little business as you call\nit bears directly on a very big business bigger perhaps than either\nyou or Miss Tuppence know.",
    "If this boy is alive he may have very\nvaluable information to give us.",
    "Therefore we must find him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but how\u201d cried Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve tried to think of everything.\u201d\n\nSir James smiled.",
    "\u201cAnd yet there\u2019s one person quite near at hand who in all probability\nknows where he is or at all events where he is likely to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is that\u201d asked Tuppence puzzled.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Vandemeyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but she\u2019d never tell us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh that is where I come in.",
    "I think it quite likely that I shall be\nable to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u201d demanded Tuppence opening her eyes very wide.",
    "\u201cOh just by asking her questions\u201d replied Sir James easily.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s\nthe way we do it you know.\u201d\n\nHe tapped with his finger on the table and Tuppence felt again the\nintense power that radiated from the man.",
    "\u201cAnd if she won\u2019t tell\u201d asked Julius suddenly.",
    "\u201cI think she will.",
    "I have one or two powerful levers.",
    "Still in that\nunlikely event there is always the possibility of bribery.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.",
    "And that\u2019s where I come in\u201d cried Julius bringing his fist down\non the table with a bang.",
    "\u201cYou can count on me if necessary for one\nmillion dollars.",
    "Yes sir one million dollars\u201d\n\nSir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Hersheimmer\u201d he said at last \u201cthat is a very large sum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019ll have to be.",
    "These aren\u2019t the kind of folk to offer\nsixpence to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over two\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.",
    "Maybe you think I\u2019m talking through my hat but I can\ndeliver the goods all right with enough over to spare for your fee.\u201d\n\nSir James flushed slightly.",
    "\u201cThere is no question of a fee Mr. Hersheimmer.",
    "I am not a private\ndetective.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.",
    "I guess I was just a mite hasty but I\u2019ve been feeling bad about\nthis money question.",
    "I wanted to offer a big reward for news of Jane\nsome days ago but your crusted institution of Scotland Yard advised me\nagainst it.",
    "Said it was undesirable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were probably right\u201d said Sir James dryly.",
    "\u201cBut it\u2019s all O.K.",
    "about Julius\u201d put in Tuppence.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s not pulling\nyour leg.",
    "He\u2019s got simply pots of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe old man piled it up in style\u201d explained Julius.",
    "\u201cNow let\u2019s get\ndown to it.",
    "What\u2019s your idea\u201d\n\nSir James considered for a moment or two.",
    "\u201cThere is no time to be lost.",
    "The sooner we strike the better.\u201d He\nturned to Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIs Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out tonight do you\nknow\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I think so but she will not be out late.",
    "Otherwise she would\nhave taken the latchkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.",
    "I will call upon her about ten o\u2019clock.",
    "What time are you\nsupposed to return\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout ninethirty or ten but I could go back earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must not do that on any account.",
    "It might arouse suspicion if you\ndid not stay out till the usual time.",
    "Be back by ninethirty.",
    "I will\narrive at ten.",
    "Mr. Hersheimmer will wait below in a taxi perhaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a new RollsRoyce car\u201d said Tuppence with vicarious pride.",
    "\u201cEven better.",
    "If I succeed in obtaining the address from her we can\ngo there at once taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if necessary.",
    "You\nunderstand\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight.",
    "\u201cOh I feel so\nmuch better\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t build on it too much Miss Tuppence.",
    "Go easy.\u201d\n\nJulius turned to the lawyer.",
    "\u201cSay then.",
    "I\u2019ll call for you in the car round about ninethirty.",
    "Is\nthat right\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps that will be the best plan.",
    "It would be unnecessary to have two\ncars waiting about.",
    "Now Miss Tuppence my advice to you is to go and\nhave a good dinner a really good one mind.",
    "And don\u2019t think ahead\nmore than you can help.\u201d\n\nHe shook hands with them both and a moment later they were outside.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t he a duck\u201d inquired Tuppence ecstatically as she skipped down\nthe steps.",
    "\u201cOh Julius isn\u2019t he just a duck\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I allow he seems to be the goods all right.",
    "And I was wrong about\nits being useless to go to him.",
    "Say shall we go right away back to the\nRitz\u201d\n\n\u201cI must walk a bit I think.",
    "I feel so excited.",
    "Drop me in the park\nwill you Unless you\u2019d like to come too\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to get some petrol\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cAnd send off a cable or\ntwo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.",
    "I\u2019ll meet you at the Ritz at seven.",
    "We\u2019ll have to dine\nupstairs.",
    "I can\u2019t show myself in these glad rags.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.",
    "I\u2019ll get Felix help me choose the menu.",
    "He\u2019s some head waiter\nthat.",
    "So long.\u201d\n\nTuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine first glancing at\nher watch.",
    "It was nearly six o\u2019clock.",
    "She remembered that she had had no\ntea but felt too excited to be conscious of hunger.",
    "She walked as\nfar as Kensington Gardens and then slowly retraced her steps feeling\ninfinitely better for the fresh air and exercise.",
    "It was not so easy to\nfollow Sir James\u2019s advice and put the possible events of the evening\nout of her head.",
    "As she drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner the\ntemptation to return to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible.",
    "At any rate she decided it would do no harm just to go and look\nat the building.",
    "Perhaps then she could resign herself to waiting\npatiently for ten o\u2019clock.",
    "South Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual.",
    "What Tuppence\nhad expected she hardly knew but the sight of its red brick stolidity\nslightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness\nthat possessed her.",
    "She was just turning away when she heard a piercing\nwhistle and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join\nher.",
    "Tuppence frowned.",
    "It was no part of the programme to have attention\ncalled to her presence in the neighbourhood but Albert was purple with\nsuppressed excitement.",
    "\u201cI say miss she\u2019s agoing\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going\u201d demanded Tuppence sharply.",
    "\u201cThe crook.",
    "Ready Rita.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer.",
    "She\u2019s apacking up and she\u2019s\njust sent down word for me to get her a taxi.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d Tuppence clutched his arm.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the truth miss.",
    "I thought maybe as you didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlbert\u201d cried Tuppence \u201cyou\u2019re a brick.",
    "If it hadn\u2019t been for you\nwe\u2019d have lost her.\u201d\n\nAlbert flushed with pleasure at this tribute.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose\u201d said Tuppence crossing the road.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got\nto stop her.",
    "At all costs I must keep her here until\u201d She broke off.",
    "\u201cAlbert there\u2019s a telephone here isn\u2019t there\u201d\n\nThe boy shook his head.",
    "\u201cThe flats mostly have their own miss.",
    "But there\u2019s a box just round the\ncorner.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to it then at once and ring up the Ritz Hotel.",
    "Ask for Mr.\nHersheimmer and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and come on\nat once as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it.",
    "If you can\u2019t get him\nring up Sir James Peel Edgerton you\u2019ll find his number in the book and\ntell him what\u2019s happening.",
    "You won\u2019t forget the names will you\u201d\n\nAlbert repeated them glibly.",
    "\u201cYou trust to me miss it\u2019ll be all right.",
    "But what about you Aren\u2019t you afraid to trust yourself with her\u201d\n\n\u201cNo no that\u2019s all right.",
    "But go and telephone.",
    "Be quick.\u201d\n\nDrawing a long breath Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up to the\ndoor of No.",
    "20.",
    "How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer until the two men\narrived she did not know but somehow or other it had to be done and\nshe must accomplish the task singlehanded.",
    "What had occasioned this\nprecipitate departure Did Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her\n\nSpeculations were idle.",
    "Tuppence pressed the bell firmly.",
    "She might\nlearn something from the cook.",
    "Nothing happened and after waiting some minutes Tuppence pressed the\nbell again keeping her finger on the button for some little while.",
    "At last she heard footsteps inside and a moment later Mrs. Vandemeyer\nherself opened the door.",
    "She lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the\ngirl.",
    "\u201cYou\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a touch of toothache ma\u2019am\u201d said Tuppence glibly.",
    "\u201cSo thought\nit better to come home and have a quiet evening.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer said nothing but she drew back and let Tuppence pass\ninto the hall.",
    "\u201cHow unfortunate for you\u201d she said coldly.",
    "\u201cYou had better go to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I shall be all right in the kitchen ma\u2019am.",
    "Cook will\u201d\n\n\u201cCook is out\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer in a rather disagreeable tone.",
    "\u201cI\nsent her out.",
    "So you see you had better go to bed.\u201d\n\nSuddenly Tuppence felt afraid.",
    "There was a ring in Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s\nvoice that she did not like at all.",
    "Also the other woman was slowly\nedging her up the passage.",
    "Tuppence turned at bay.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t want\u201d\n\nThen in a flash a rim of cold steel touched her temple and Mrs.\nVandemeyer\u2019s voice rose cold and menacing\n\n\u201cYou damned little fool Do you think I don\u2019t know No don\u2019t answer.",
    "If\nyou struggle or cry out I\u2019ll shoot you like a dog.\u201d\n\nThe rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girl\u2019s temple.",
    "\u201cNow then march\u201d went on Mrs. Vandemeyer.",
    "\u201cThis wayinto my room.",
    "In\na minute when I\u2019ve done with you you\u2019ll go to bed as I told you to.",
    "And you\u2019ll sleepoh yes my little spy you\u2019ll sleep all right\u201d\n\nThere was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which Tuppence\ndid not at all like.",
    "For the moment there was nothing to be done and\nshe walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s bedroom.",
    "The pistol never\nleft her forehead.",
    "The room was in a state of wild disorder clothes\nwere flung about right and left a suitcase and a hat box halfpacked\nstood in the middle of the floor.",
    "Tuppence pulled herself together with an effort.",
    "Her voice shook a\nlittle but she spoke out bravely.",
    "\u201cCome now\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cThis is nonsense.",
    "You can\u2019t shoot me.",
    "Why every\none in the building would hear the report.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d risk that\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully.",
    "\u201cBut as long as you\ndon\u2019t sing out for help you\u2019re all rightand I don\u2019t think you will.",
    "You\u2019re a clever girl.",
    "You deceived me all right.",
    "I hadn\u2019t a suspicion\nof you So I\u2019ve no doubt that you understand perfectly well that this\nis where I\u2019m on top and you\u2019re underneath.",
    "Now thensit on the bed.",
    "Put\nyour hands above your head and if you value your life don\u2019t move them.\u201d\n\nTuppence obeyed passively.",
    "Her good sense told her that there was\nnothing else to do but accept the situation.",
    "If she shrieked for help\nthere was very little chance of anyone hearing her whereas there was\nprobably quite a good chance of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s shooting her.",
    "In the\nmeantime every minute of delay gained was valuable.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the washstand\nwithin reach of her hand and still eyeing Tuppence like a lynx in case\nthe girl should attempt to move she took a little stoppered bottle from\nits place on the marble and poured some of its contents into a glass\nwhich she filled up with water.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u201d asked Tuppence sharply.",
    "\u201cSomething to make you sleep soundly.\u201d\n\nTuppence paled a little.",
    "\u201cAre you going to poison me\u201d she asked in a whisper.",
    "\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer smiling agreeably.",
    "\u201cThen I shan\u2019t drink it\u201d said Tuppence firmly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d much rather be\nshot.",
    "At any rate that would make a row and some one might hear it.",
    "But\nI won\u2019t be killed off quietly like a lamb.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t be a little fool Do you really think I want a hue and cry for\nmurder out after me If you\u2019ve any sense at all you\u2019ll realize that\npoisoning you wouldn\u2019t suit my book at all.",
    "It\u2019s a sleeping draught\nthat\u2019s all.",
    "You\u2019ll wake up tomorrow morning none the worse.",
    "I simply\ndon\u2019t want the bother of tying you up and gagging you.",
    "That\u2019s the\nalternativeand you won\u2019t like it I can tell you I can be very rough\nif I choose.",
    "So drink this down like a good girl and you\u2019ll be none the\nworse for it.\u201d\n\nIn her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her.",
    "The arguments she had\nadduced rang true.",
    "It was a simple and effective method of getting her\nout of the way for the time being.",
    "Nevertheless the girl did not take\nkindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep without as much as one\nbid for freedom.",
    "She felt that once Mrs. Vandemeyer gave them the slip\nthe last hope of finding Tommy would be gone.",
    "Tuppence was quick in her mental processes.",
    "All these reflections\npassed through her mind in a flash and she saw where a chance a very\nproblematical chance lay and she determined to risk all in one supreme\neffort.",
    "Accordingly she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her knees\nbefore Mrs. Vandemeyer clutching her skirts frantically.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u201d she moaned.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s poisonI know it\u2019s poison.",
    "Oh don\u2019t make me drink it\u201dher voice rose to a shriek\u201cdon\u2019t make me\ndrink it\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer glass in hand looked down with a curling lip at this\nsudden collapse.",
    "\u201cGet up you little idiot Don\u2019t go on drivelling there.",
    "How you ever\nhad the nerve to play your part as you did I can\u2019t think.\u201d She stamped\nher foot.",
    "\u201cGet up I say.\u201d\n\nBut Tuppence continued to cling and sob interjecting her sobs with\nincoherent appeals for mercy.",
    "Every minute gained was to the good.",
    "Moreover as she grovelled she moved imperceptibly nearer to her\nobjective.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation and jerked the girl\nto her knees.",
    "\u201cDrink it at once\u201d Imperiously she pressed the glass to the girl\u2019s\nlips.",
    "Tuppence gave one last despairing moan.",
    "\u201cYou swear it won\u2019t hurt me\u201d she temporized.",
    "\u201cOf course it won\u2019t hurt you.",
    "Don\u2019t be a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you swear it\u201d\n\n\u201cYes yes\u201d said the other impatiently.",
    "\u201cI swear it.\u201d\n\nTuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass.",
    "\u201cVery well.\u201d Her mouth opened meekly.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief off her guard for the moment.",
    "Then quick as a flash Tuppence jerked the glass upward as hard as she\ncould.",
    "The fluid in it splashed into Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s face and during\nher momentary gasp Tuppence\u2019s right hand shot out and grasped the\nrevolver where it lay on the edge of the washstand.",
    "The next moment\nshe had sprung back a pace and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs.\nVandemeyer\u2019s heart with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it.",
    "In the moment of victory Tuppence betrayed a somewhat unsportsmanlike\ntriumph.",
    "\u201cNow who\u2019s on top and who\u2019s underneath\u201d she crowed.",
    "The other\u2019s face was convulsed with rage.",
    "For a minute Tuppence thought\nshe was going to spring upon her which would have placed the girl in an\nunpleasant dilemma since she meant to draw the line at actually letting\noff the revolver.",
    "However with an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled\nherself and at last a slow evil smile crept over her face.",
    "\u201cNot a fool then after all You did that well girl.",
    "But you shall pay\nfor itoh yes you shall pay for it I have a long memory\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you should have been gulled so easily\u201d said Tuppence\nscornfully.",
    "\u201cDid you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about\non the floor and whine for mercy\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may dosome day\u201d said the other significantly.",
    "The cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down\nTuppence\u2019s spine but she was not going to give in to it.",
    "\u201cSupposing we sit down\u201d she said pleasantly.",
    "\u201cOur present attitude is\na little melodramatic.",
    "Nonot on the bed.",
    "Draw a chair up to the table\nthat\u2019s right.",
    "Now I\u2019ll sit opposite you with the revolver in front of\nmejust in case of accidents.",
    "Splendid.",
    "Now let\u2019s talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly.",
    "Tuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute.",
    "She was remembering several\nthings.",
    "Boris\u2019s words \u201cI believe you would sell us\u201d and her\nanswer \u201cThe price would have to be enormous\u201d given lightly it was\ntrue yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it Long ago\nhad not Whittington asked \u201cWho\u2019s been blabbing Rita\u201d Would Rita\nVandemeyer prove to be the weak spot in the armour of Mr. Brown\n\nKeeping her eyes fixed steadily on the other\u2019s face Tuppence replied\nquietly\n\n\u201cMoney\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer started.",
    "Clearly the reply was unexpected.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you.",
    "You said just now that you had a long memory.",
    "A long\nmemory isn\u2019t half as useful as a long purse I dare say it relieves your\nfeelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of dreadful things to do to\nme but is that practical Revenge is very unsatisfactory.",
    "Every one\nalways says so.",
    "But money\u201dTuppence warmed to her pet creed\u201cwell\nthere\u2019s nothing unsatisfactory about money is there\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer scornfully \u201cthat I am the kind of\nwoman to sell my friends\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tuppence promptly.",
    "\u201cIf the price was big enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cA paltry hundred pounds or so\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI should suggesta hundred thousand\u201d\n\nHer economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole million\ndollars suggested by Julius.",
    "A flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cWhat did you say\u201d she asked her fingers playing nervously with a\nbrooch on her breast.",
    "In that moment Tuppence knew that the fish was\nhooked and for the first time she felt a horror of her own moneyloving\nspirit.",
    "It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship to the woman fronting\nher.",
    "\u201cA hundred thousand pounds\u201d repeated Tuppence.",
    "The light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s eyes.",
    "She leaned back in her\nchair.",
    "\u201cBah\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t got it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d admitted Tuppence \u201cI haven\u2019tbut I know some one who has.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u201d\n\n\u201cA friend of mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be a millionaire\u201d remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly.",
    "\u201cAs a matter of fact he is.",
    "He\u2019s an American.",
    "He\u2019ll pay you that\nwithout a murmur.",
    "You can take it from me that it\u2019s a perfectly genuine\nproposition.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer sat up again.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m inclined to believe you\u201d she said slowly.",
    "There was silence between them for some time then Mrs. Vandemeyer\nlooked up.",
    "\u201cWhat does he want to know this friend of yours\u201d\n\nTuppence went through a momentary struggle but it was Julius\u2019s money\nand his interests must come first.",
    "\u201cHe wants to know where Jane Finn is\u201d she said boldly.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer showed no surprise.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not sure where she is at the present moment\u201d she replied.",
    "\u201cBut you could find out\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes\u201d returned Mrs. Vandemeyer carelessly.",
    "\u201cThere would be no\ndifficulty about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen\u201dTuppence\u2019s voice shook a little\u201cthere\u2019s a boy a friend of\nmine.",
    "I\u2019m afraid something\u2019s happened to him through your pal Boris.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name\u201d\n\n\u201cTommy Beresford.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever heard of him.",
    "But I\u2019ll ask Boris.",
    "He\u2019ll tell me anything he\nknows.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits.",
    "It impelled\nher to more audacious efforts.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s one thing more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\nTuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice.",
    "\u201cWho is Mr. Brown\u201d\n\nHer quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face.",
    "With an\neffort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to resume her\nformer manner.",
    "But the attempt was a mere parody.",
    "She shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t have learnt much about us if you don\u2019t know that nobody\nknows who Mr. Brown is....\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do\u201d said Tuppence quietly.",
    "Again the colour deserted the other\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cWhat makes you think that\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said the girl truthfully.",
    "\u201cBut I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d she said hoarsely at last \u201cI know.",
    "I was beautiful you\nseevery beautiful\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are still\u201d said Tuppence with admiration.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer shook her head.",
    "There was a strange gleam in her\nelectricblue eyes.",
    "\u201cNot beautiful enough\u201d she said in a soft dangerous voice.",
    "\u201cNotbeautifulenough And sometimes lately I\u2019ve been afraid....\nIt\u2019s dangerous to know too much\u201d She leaned forward across the table.",
    "\u201cSwear that my name shan\u2019t be brought into itthat no one shall ever\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear it.",
    "And once\u2019s he caught you\u2019ll be out of danger.\u201d\n\nA terrified look swept across Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cShall I Shall I ever be\u201d She clutched Tuppence\u2019s arm.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re sure\nabout the money\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen shall I have it There must be no delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis friend of mine will be here presently.",
    "He may have to send cables\nor something like that.",
    "But there won\u2019t be any delayhe\u2019s a terrific\nhustler.\u201d\n\nA resolute look settled on Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll do it.",
    "It\u2019s a great sum of money and besides\u201dshe gave a curious\nsmile\u201cit is notwise to throw over a woman like me\u201d\n\nFor a moment or two she remained smiling and lightly tapping her\nfingers on the table.",
    "Suddenly she started and her face blanched.",
    "\u201cWhat was that\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard nothing.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully.",
    "\u201cIf there should be some one listening\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense.",
    "Who could there be\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the walls might have ears\u201d whispered the other.",
    "\u201cI tell you I\u2019m\nfrightened.",
    "You don\u2019t know him\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of the hundred thousand pounds\u201d said Tuppence soothingly.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t know him\u201d she reiterated hoarsely.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019sah\u201d\n\nWith a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet.",
    "Her outstretched hand\npointed over Tuppence\u2019s head.",
    "Then she swayed to the ground in a dead\nfaint.",
    "Tuppence looked round to see what had startled her.",
    "In the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius Hersheimmer.",
    "CHAPTER XIII.",
    "THE VIGIL\n\nSIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen woman.",
    "\u201cHeart\u201d he said sharply.",
    "\u201cSeeing us so suddenly must have given her a\nshock.",
    "Brandyand quickly or she\u2019ll slip through our fingers.\u201d\n\nJulius hurried to the washstand.",
    "\u201cNot there\u201d said Tuppence over her shoulder.",
    "\u201cIn the tantalus in the\ndiningroom.",
    "Second door down the passage.\u201d\n\nBetween them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and carried\nher to the bed.",
    "There they dashed water on her face but with no result.",
    "The lawyer fingered her pulse.",
    "\u201cTouch and go\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cI wish that young fellow would hurry up\nwith the brandy.\u201d\n\nAt that moment Julius reentered the room carrying a glass half full of\nthe spirit which he handed to Sir James.",
    "While Tuppence lifted her head\nthe lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit between her closed\nlips.",
    "Finally the woman opened her eyes feebly.",
    "Tuppence held the glass\nto her lips.",
    "\u201cDrink this.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer complied.",
    "The brandy brought the colour back to her\nwhite cheeks and revived her in a marvellous fashion.",
    "She tried to sit\nupthen fell back with a groan her hand to her side.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s my heart\u201d she whispered.",
    "\u201cI mustn\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nShe lay back with closed eyes.",
    "Sir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer then withdrew it\nwith a nod.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019ll do now.\u201d\n\nAll three moved away and stood together talking in low voices.",
    "One\nand all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax.",
    "Clearly any\nscheme for crossquestioning the lady was out of the question for the\nmoment.",
    "For the time being they were baffled and could do nothing.",
    "Tuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing\nto disclose the identity of Mr. Brown and how she had consented to\ndiscover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn.",
    "Julius was\ncongratulatory.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all right Miss Tuppence.",
    "Splendid I guess that hundred\nthousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it\ndid over night.",
    "There\u2019s nothing to worry over.",
    "She won\u2019t speak without\nthe cash anyway you bet\u201d\n\nThere was certainly a good deal of common sense in this and Tuppence\nfelt a little comforted.",
    "\u201cWhat you say is true\u201d said Sir James meditatively.",
    "\u201cI must confess\nhowever that I cannot help wishing we had not interrupted at the minute\nwe did.",
    "Still it cannot be helped it is only a matter of waiting until\nthe morning.\u201d\n\nHe looked across at the inert figure on the bed.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer lay\nperfectly passive with closed eyes.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Tuppence with an attempt at cheerfulness \u201cwe must wait\nuntil the morning that\u2019s all.",
    "But I don\u2019t think we ought to leave the\nflat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard\u201d\n\n\u201cAlbert And suppose she came round again and hooked it.",
    "Albert couldn\u2019t\nstop her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess she won\u2019t want to make tracks away from the dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might.",
    "She seemed very frightened of \u2018Mr.",
    "Brown.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Real plumb scared of him\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "She looked round and said even walls had ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she meant a dictaphone\u201d said Julius with interest.",
    "\u201cMiss Tuppence is right\u201d said Sir James quietly.",
    "\u201cWe must not leave the\nflatif only for Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nJulius stared at him.",
    "\u201cYou think he\u2019d get after her Between now and tomorrow morning.",
    "How\ncould he know even\u201d\n\n\u201cYou forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone\u201d said Sir James dryly.",
    "\u201cWe have a very formidable adversary.",
    "I believe if we exercise all due\ncare that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our\nhands.",
    "But we must neglect no precaution.",
    "We have an important witness\nbut she must be safeguarded.",
    "I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should\ngo to bed and that you and I Mr. Hersheimmer should share the vigil.\u201d\n\nTuppence was about to protest but happening to glance at the bed she\nsaw Mrs. Vandemeyer her eyes halfopen with such an expression of\nmingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words\non her lips.",
    "For a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had\nbeen a gigantic sham but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly\ncredit the supposition.",
    "As she looked the expression disappeared as by\nmagic and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before.",
    "For a\nmoment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it.",
    "But she determined\nnevertheless to be on the alert.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Julius \u201cI guess we\u2019d better make a move out of here any\nway.\u201d\n\nThe others fell in with his suggestion.",
    "Sir James again felt Mrs.\nVandemeyer\u2019s pulse.",
    "\u201cPerfectly satisfactory\u201d he said in a low voice to Tuppence.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019ll be\nabsolutely all right after a night\u2019s rest.\u201d\n\nThe girl hesitated a moment by the bed.",
    "The intensity of the expression\nshe had surprised had impressed her powerfully.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted\nher lids.",
    "She seemed to be struggling to speak.",
    "Tuppence bent over her.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019tleave\u201d she seemed unable to proceed murmuring something\nthat sounded like \u201csleepy.\u201d Then she tried again.",
    "Tuppence bent lower still.",
    "It was only a breath.",
    "\u201cMr.Brown\u201d The voice stopped.",
    "But the halfclosed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message.",
    "Moved by a sudden impulse the girl said quickly\n\n\u201cI shan\u2019t leave the flat.",
    "I shall sit up all night.\u201d\n\nA flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more.",
    "Apparently\nMrs. Vandemeyer slept.",
    "But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in\nTuppence.",
    "What had she meant by that low murmur \u201cMr.",

    "I ran round for Sir James\nhere and we came right on.",

    "He\u2019d been\nlistening outside the door of the flat but couldn\u2019t hear anything.",
    "Anyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing\nthe bell.",
    "And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along\nto find you.",
    "Albert\u2019s still below and must be just hopping mad by this\ntime.\u201d With which Julius departed abruptly.",

    "Gee if I ever lay hands on it again I\u2019ll freeze on to\nit likelike hell\u201d\n\n\u201cThat contingency is likely to be a remote one\u201d said the other dryly.",

    "\u201cSitting up at night is always rather jumpy\u201d she confessed.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Sir James.",

    "Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous\nresults.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you believe in spiritualism\u201d asked Tuppence opening her eyes wide.",
    "The lawyer shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cThere is some truth in it without a doubt.",
    "But most of the testimony\nwould not pass muster in the witnessbox.\u201d\n\nThe hours drew on.",
    "With the first faint glimmerings of dawn Sir James\ndrew aside the curtains.",
    "They beheld what few Londoners see the slow\nrising of the sun over the sleeping city.",
    "Somehow with the coming\nof the light the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd.",

    "\u201cWho\u2019s the other cup for\u201d inquired Julius.",
    "\u201cThe prisoner of course.",
    "I suppose we might call her that\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night\u201d said Julius\nthoughtfully.",
    "\u201cYes it does\u201d admitted Tuppence.",
    "\u201cBut anyway here goes.",
    "Perhaps\nyou\u2019d both come too in case she springs on me or anything.",
    "You see\nwe don\u2019t know what mood she\u2019ll wake up in.\u201d\n\nSir James and Julius accompanied her to the door.",
    "\u201cWhere\u2019s the key Oh of course I\u2019ve got it myself.\u201d\n\nShe put it in the lock and turned it then paused.",

    "Her cry brought the others.",
    "A very few minutes sufficed.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer\nwas deadmust have been dead some hours.",
    "She had evidently died in her\nsleep.",
    "\u201cIf that isn\u2019t the cruellest luck\u201d cried Julius in despair.",
    "The lawyer was calmer but there was a curious gleam in his eyes.",
    "\u201cIf it is luck\u201d he replied.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t thinkbut say that\u2019s plumb impossibleno one could have\ngot in.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d admitted the lawyer.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t see how they could.",
    "And yetshe is\non the point of betraying Mr. Brown andshe dies.",
    "Is it only chance\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how\u201d\n\n\u201cYes how That is what we must find out.\u201d He stood there silently\ngently stroking his chin.",
    "\u201cWe must find out\u201d he said quietly and\nTuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would not like the tone of\nthose simple words.",
    "Julius\u2019s glance went to the window.",
    "\u201cThe window\u2019s open\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cDo you think\u201d\n\nTuppence shook her head.",
    "\u201cThe balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir.",
    "We were there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe might have slipped out\u201d suggested Julius.",
    "But Sir James interrupted him.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Brown\u2019s methods are not so crude.",
    "In the meantime we must send for\na doctor but before we do so is there anything in this room that might\nbe of value to us\u201d\n\nHastily the three searched.",
    "A charred mass in the grate indicated\nthat Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight.",
    "Nothing of importance remained though they searched the other rooms as\nwell.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s that\u201d said Tuppence suddenly pointing to a small\noldfashioned safe let into the wall.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s for jewellery I believe\nbut there might be something else in it.\u201d\n\nThe key was in the lock and Julius swung open the door and searched\ninside.",
    "He was some time over the task.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Tuppence impatiently.",
    "There was a pause before Julius answered then he withdrew his head and\nshut to the door.",
    "\u201cNothing\u201d he said.",
    "In five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived hastily summoned.",
    "He was\ndeferential to Sir James whom he recognized.",
    "\u201cHeart failure or possibly an overdose of some sleepingdraught.\u201d He\nsniffed.",
    "\u201cRather an odour of chloral in the air.\u201d\n\nTuppence remembered the glass she had upset.",
    "A new thought drove her to\nthe washstand.",
    "She found the little bottle from which Mrs. Vandemeyer\nhad poured a few drops.",
    "It had been three parts full.",
    "Now it was empty.",
    "CHAPTER XIV.",
    "A CONSULTATION\n\nNOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the ease\nand simplicity with which everything was arranged owing to Sir James\u2019s\nskilful handling.",
    "The doctor accepted quite readily the theory that Mrs.\nVandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral.",
    "He doubted\nwhether an inquest would be necessary.",
    "If so he would let Sir James\nknow.",
    "He understood that Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for\nabroad and that the servants had already left Sir James and his young\nfriends had been paying a call upon her when she was suddenly stricken\ndown and they had spent the night in the flat not liking to leave\nher alone.",
    "Did they know of any relatives They did not but Sir James\nreferred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s solicitor.",
    "Shortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge and the other left\nthe illomened building.",
    "\u201cAnd what now\u201d asked Julius with a gesture of despair.",
    "\u201cI guess we\u2019re\ndown and out for good.\u201d\n\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cThere is still the chance that Dr. Hall may be\nable to tell us something.\u201d\n\n\u201cGee I\u2019d forgotten him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chance is slight but it must not be neglected.",
    "I think I told you\nthat he is staying at the M\u00e9tropole.",
    "I should suggest that we call\nupon him there as soon as possible.",
    "Shall we say after a bath and\nbreakfast\u201d\n\nIt was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the Ritz\nand call for Sir James in the car.",
    "This programme was faithfully carried\nout and a little after eleven they drew up before the M\u00e9tropole.",
    "They asked for Dr. Hall and a pageboy went in search of him.",
    "In a few\nminutes the little doctor came hurrying towards them.",
    "\u201cCan you spare us a few minutes Dr. Hall\u201d said Sir James pleasantly.",
    "\u201cLet me introduce you to Miss Cowley.",
    "Mr. Hersheimmer I think you\nalready know.\u201d\n\nA quizzical gleam came into the doctor\u2019s eye as he shook hands with\nJulius.",
    "\u201cAh yes my young friend of the tree episode Ankle all right eh\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s cured owing to your skilful treatment doc.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the heart trouble Ha ha\u201d\n\n\u201cStill searching\u201d said Julius briefly.",
    "\u201cTo come to the point can we have a word with you in private\u201d asked\nSir James.",
    "\u201cCertainly.",
    "I think there is a room here where we shall be quite\nundisturbed.\u201d\n\nHe led the way and the others followed him.",
    "They sat down and the\ndoctor looked inquiringly at Sir James.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Hall I am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the\npurpose of obtaining a statement from her.",
    "I have reason to believe\nthat she has been at one time or another in your establishment at\nBournemouth.",
    "I hope I am transgressing no professional etiquette in\nquestioning you on the subject\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose it is a matter of testimony\u201d\n\nSir James hesitated a moment then he replied\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be pleased to give you any information in my power.",
    "What is\nthe young lady\u2019s name Mr. Hersheimmer asked me I remember\u201d He half\nturned to Julius.",
    "\u201cThe name\u201d said Sir James bluntly \u201cis really immaterial.",
    "She would be\nalmost certainly sent to you under an assumed one.",
    "But I should like to\nknow if you are acquainted with a Mrs. Vandemeyer\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Vandemeyer of 20 South Audley Mansions I know her slightly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not aware of what has happened\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead\u201d\n\n\u201cDear dear I had no idea of it When did it happen\u201d\n\n\u201cShe took an overdose of chloral last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cPurposely\u201d\n\n\u201cAccidentally it is believed.",
    "I should not like to say myself.",
    "Anyway\nshe was found dead this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery sad.",
    "A singularly handsome woman.",
    "I presume she was a friend of\nyours since you are acquainted with all these details.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am acquainted with the details becausewell it was I who found her\ndead.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed\u201d said the doctor starting.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Sir James and stroked his chin reflectively.",
    "\u201cThis is very sad news but you will excuse me if I say that I do not\nsee how it bears on the subject of your inquiry\u201d\n\n\u201cIt bears on it in this way is it not a fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer\ncommitted a young relative of hers to your charge\u201d\n\nJulius leaned forward eagerly.",
    "\u201cThat is the case\u201d said the doctor quietly.",
    "\u201cUnder the name of\u201d\n\n\u201cJanet Vandemeyer.",
    "I understood her to be a niece of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she came to you\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas she a mental case\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is perfectly sane if that is what you mean.",
    "I understood from Mrs.\nVandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the Lusitania when\nthat illfated ship was sunk and had suffered a severe shock in\nconsequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the right track I think\u201d Sir James looked round.",
    "\u201cAs I said before I\u2019m a mutt\u201d returned Julius.",
    "The doctor looked at them all curiously.",
    "\u201cYou spoke of wanting a statement from her\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSupposing she is\nnot able to give one\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo she is.",
    "Nevertheless if you want a statement from her concerning\nany events prior to May 7 1915 she will not be able to give it to\nyou.\u201d\n\nThey looked at the little man stupefied.",
    "He nodded cheerfully.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a pity\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cA great pity especially as I gather Sir\nJames that the matter is important.",
    "But there it is she can tell you\nnothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why man Darn it all why\u201d\n\nThe little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young\nAmerican.",
    "\u201cBecause Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
    "An interesting case a very interesting case.",
    "Not so\nuncommon really as you would think.",
    "There are several very well known\nparallels.",
    "It\u2019s the first case of the kind that I\u2019ve had under my own\npersonal observation and I must admit that I\u2019ve found it of absorbing\ninterest.\u201d There was something rather ghoulish in the little man\u2019s\nsatisfaction.",
    "\u201cAnd she remembers nothing\u201d said Sir James slowly.",
    "\u201cNothing prior to May 7 1915.",
    "After that date her memory is as good as\nyours or mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the first thing she remembers\u201d\n\n\u201cIs landing with the survivors.",
    "Everything before that is a blank.",
    "She\ndid not know her own name or where she had come from or where she was.",
    "She couldn\u2019t even speak her own tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely all this is most unusual\u201d put in Julius.",
    "\u201cNo my dear sir.",
    "Quite normal under the circumstances.",
    "Severe shock to\nthe nervous system.",
    "Loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same\nlines.",
    "I suggested a specialist of course.",
    "There\u2019s a very good man in\nParismakes a study of these casesbut Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the\nidea of publicity that might result from such a course.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can imagine she would\u201d said Sir James grimly.",
    "\u201cI fell in with her views.",
    "There is a certain notoriety given to these\ncases.",
    "And the girl was very youngnineteen I believe.",
    "It seemed\na pity that her infirmity should be talked aboutmight damage her\nprospects.",
    "Besides there is no special treatment to pursue in such\ncases.",

    "In a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips\nwith the brief command \u201cDrink.\u201d Tommy obeyed.",
    "The potency of the draught\nmade him choke but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner.",
    "He was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held.",
    "On one side of him was the German on the other the villainousfaced\ndoorkeeper who had let him in.",
    "The others were grouped together at a\nlittle distance away.",
    "But Tommy missed one face.",
    "The man known as Number\nOne was no longer of the company.",
    "\u201cFeel better\u201d asked the German as he removed the empty glass.",
    "\u201cYes thanks\u201d returned Tommy cheerfully.",
    "\u201cAh my young friend it is lucky for you your skull is so thick.",
    "The\ngood Conrad struck hard.\u201d He indicated the evilfaced doorkeeper by a\nnod.",
    "The man grinned.",
    "Tommy twisted his head round with an effort.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d he said \u201cso you\u2019re Conrad are you It strikes me the thickness\nof my skull was lucky for you too.",
    "When I look at you I feel it\u2019s almost\na pity I\u2019ve enabled you to cheat the hangman.\u201d\n\nThe man snarled and the bearded man said quietly\n\n\u201cHe would have run no risk of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as you like\u201d replied Tommy.",
    "\u201cI know it\u2019s the fashion to run down\nthe police.",
    "I rather believe in them myself.\u201d\n\nHis manner was nonchalant to the last degree.",
    "Tommy Beresford was one\nof those young Englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual\nability but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a\n\u201ctight place.\u201d Their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like\na glove.",
    "Tommy realized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only\nchance of escape and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains\nfuriously.",
    "The cold accents of the German took up the conversation\n\n\u201cHave you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply lots of things\u201d replied Tommy with the same urbanity as before.",
    "\u201cDo you deny that you were listening at that door\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not.",
    "I must really apologizebut your conversation was so\ninteresting that it overcame my scruples.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get in\u201d\n\n\u201cDear old Conrad here.\u201d Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him.",
    "\u201cI hesitate\nto suggest pensioning off a faithful servant but you really ought to\nhave a better watchdog.\u201d\n\nConrad snarled impotently and said sullenly as the man with the beard\nswung round upon him\n\n\u201cHe gave the word.",
    "How was I to know\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d Tommy chimed in.",
    "\u201cHow was he to know Don\u2019t blame the poor\nfellow.",
    "His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all\nface to face.\u201d\n\nHe fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the group but\nthe watchful German stilled it with a wave of his hand.",
    "\u201cDead men tell no tales\u201d he said evenly.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d said Tommy \u201cbut I\u2019m not dead yet\u201d\n\n\u201cYou soon will be my young friend\u201d said the German.",
    "An assenting murmur came from the others.",
    "Tommy\u2019s heart beat faster but his casual pleasantness did not waver.",
    "\u201cI think not\u201d he said firmly.",
    "\u201cI should have a great objection to\ndying.\u201d\n\nHe had got them puzzled he saw that by the look on his captor\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cCan you give us any reason why we should not put you to death\u201d asked\nthe German.",
    "\u201cSeveral\u201d replied Tommy.",
    "\u201cLook here you\u2019ve been asking me a lot of\nquestions.",
    "Let me ask you one for a change.",
    "Why didn\u2019t you kill me off\nat once before I regained consciousness\u201d\n\nThe German hesitated and Tommy seized his advantage.",
    "\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t know how much I knewand where I obtained that\nknowledge.",
    "If you kill me now you never will know.\u201d\n\nBut here the emotions of Boris became too much for him.",
    "He stepped\nforward waving his arms.",
    "\u201cYou hellhound of a spy\u201d he screamed.",
    "\u201cWe will give you short shrift.",
    "Kill him Kill him\u201d\n\nThere was a roar of applause.",
    "\u201cYou hear\u201d said the German his eyes on Tommy.",
    "\u201cWhat have you to say to\nthat\u201d\n\n\u201cSay\u201d Tommy shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cPack of fools.",
    "Let them ask\nthemselves a few questions.",
    "How did I get into this place Remember what\ndear old Conrad said with your own password wasn\u2019t it How did I\nget hold of that You don\u2019t suppose I came up those steps haphazard and\nsaid the first thing that came into my head\u201d\n\nTommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech.",
    "His only\nregret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its full flavour.",
    "\u201cThat is true\u201d said the working man suddenly.",
    "\u201cComrades we have been\nbetrayed\u201d\n\nAn ugly murmur arose.",
    "Tommy smiled at them encouragingly.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s better.",
    "How can you hope to make a success of any job if you\ndon\u2019t use your brains\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will tell us who has betrayed us\u201d said the German.",
    "\u201cBut that shall\nnot save youoh no You shall tell us all that you know.",
    "Boris here\nknows pretty ways of making people speak\u201d\n\n\u201cBah\u201d said Tommy scornfully fighting down a singularly unpleasant\nfeeling in the pit of his stomach.",
    "\u201cYou will neither torture me nor kill\nme.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why not\u201d asked Boris.",
    "\u201cBecause you\u2019d kill the goose that lays the golden eggs\u201d replied Tommy\nquietly.",
    "There was a momentary pause.",
    "It seemed as though Tommy\u2019s persistent\nassurance was at last conquering.",
    "They were no longer completely sure of\nthemselves.",
    "The man in the shabby clothes stared at Tommy searchingly.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s bluffing you Boris\u201d he said quietly.",
    "Tommy hated him.",
    "Had the man seen through him\n\nThe German with an effort turned roughly to Tommy.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think I mean\u201d parried Tommy searching desperately in his\nown mind.",
    "Suddenly Boris stepped forward and shook his fist in Tommy\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cSpeak you swine of an Englishmanspeak\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get so excited my good fellow\u201d said Tommy calmly.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the\nworst of you foreigners.",
    "You can\u2019t keep calm.",
    "Now I ask you do I look\nas though I thought there were the least chance of your killing me\u201d\n\nHe looked confidently round and was glad they could not hear the\npersistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d admitted Boris at last sullenly \u201cyou do not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank God he\u2019s not a mind reader\u201d thought Tommy.",
    "Aloud he pursued his\nadvantage\n\n\u201cAnd why am I so confident Because I know something that puts me in a\nposition to propose a bargain.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bargain\u201d The bearded man took him up sharply.",
    "\u201cYesa bargain.",
    "My life and liberty against\u201d He paused.",
    "\u201cAgainst what\u201d\n\nThe group pressed forward.",
    "You could have heard a pin drop.",
    "Slowly Tommy spoke.",
    "\u201cThe papers that Danvers brought over from America in the Lusitania.\u201d\n\nThe effect of his words was electrical.",
    "Every one was on his feet.",
    "The German waved them back.",
    "He leaned over Tommy his face purple with\nexcitement.",
    "\u201cHimmel You have got them then\u201d\n\nWith magnificent calm Tommy shook his head.",
    "\u201cYou know where they are\u201d persisted the German.",
    "Again Tommy shook his head.",
    "\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\n\n\u201cThenthen\u201d angry and baffled the words failed him.",
    "Tommy looked round.",
    "He saw anger and bewilderment on every face but his\ncalm assurance had done its workno one doubted but that something lay\nbehind his words.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know where the papers arebut I believe that I can find them.",
    "I have a theory\u201d\n\n\u201cPah\u201d\n\nTommy raised his hand and silenced the clamours of disgust.",
    "\u201cI call it a theorybut I\u2019m pretty sure of my factsfacts that are\nknown to no one but myself.",
    "In any case what do you lose If I can\nproduce the papersyou give me my life and liberty in exchange.",
    "Is it a\nbargain\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if we refuse\u201d said the German quietly.",
    "Tommy lay back on the couch.",
    "\u201cThe 29th\u201d he said thoughtfully \u201cis less than a fortnight ahead\u201d\n\nFor a moment the German hesitated.",
    "Then he made a sign to Conrad.",
    "\u201cTake him into the other room.\u201d\n\nFor five minutes Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next door.",
    "His\nheart was beating violently.",
    "He had risked all on this throw.",
    "How would\nthey decide And all the while that this agonized questioning went on\nwithin him he talked flippantly to Conrad enraging the crossgrained\ndoorkeeper to the point of homicidal mania.",
    "At last the door opened and the German called imperiously to Conrad to\nreturn.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s hope the judge hasn\u2019t put his black cap on\u201d remarked Tommy\nfrivolously.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s right Conrad march me in.",
    "The prisoner is at the\nbar gentlemen.\u201d\n\nThe German was seated once more behind the table.",
    "He motioned to Tommy\nto sit down opposite to him.",
    "\u201cWe accept\u201d he said harshly \u201con terms.",
    "The papers must be delivered to\nus before you go free.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdiot\u201d said Tommy amiably.",
    "\u201cHow do you think I can look for them if\nyou keep me tied by the leg here\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you expect then\u201d\n\n\u201cI must have liberty to go about the business in my own way.\u201d\n\nThe German laughed.",
    "\u201cDo you think we are little children to let you walk out of here leaving\nus a pretty story full of promises\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tommy thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThough infinitely simpler for me I\ndid not really think you would agree to that plan.",
    "Very well we must\narrange a compromise.",
    "How would it be if you attached little Conrad here\nto my person.",
    "He\u2019s a faithful fellow and very ready with the fist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe prefer\u201d said the German coldly \u201cthat you should remain here.",
    "One of our number will carry out your instructions minutely.",
    "If the\noperations are complicated he will return to you with a report and you\ncan instruct him further.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re tying my hands\u201d complained Tommy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate affair\nand the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not and then where\nshall I be I don\u2019t believe one of you has got an ounce of tact.\u201d\n\nThe German rapped the table.",
    "\u201cThose are our terms.",
    "Otherwise death\u201d\n\nTommy leaned back wearily.",
    "\u201cI like your style.",
    "Curt but attractive.",
    "So be it then.",
    "But one thing\nis essential I must see the girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat girl\u201d\n\n\u201cJane Finn of course.\u201d\n\nThe other looked at him curiously for some minutes then he said slowly\nand as though choosing his words with care\n\n\u201cDo you not know that she can tell you nothing\u201d\n\nTommy\u2019s heart beat a little faster.",
    "Would he succeed in coming face to\nface with the girl he was seeking\n\n\u201cI shall not ask her to tell me anything\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cNot in so\nmany words that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why see her\u201d\n\nTommy paused.",
    "\u201cTo watch her face when I ask her one question\u201d he replied at last.",
    "Again there was a look in the German\u2019s eyes that Tommy did not quite\nunderstand.",
    "\u201cShe will not be able to answer your question.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat does not matter.",
    "I shall have seen her face when I ask it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think that will tell you anything\u201d He gave a short\ndisagreeable laugh.",
    "More than ever Tommy felt that there was a\nfactor somewhere that he did not understand.",
    "The German looked at\nhim searchingly.",
    "\u201cI wonder whether after all you know as much as we\nthink\u201d he said softly.",
    "Tommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before.",
    "His hold had\nslipped a little.",
    "But he was puzzled.",
    "What had he said wrong He spoke\nout on the impulse of the moment.",
    "\u201cThere may be things that you know which I do not.",
    "I have not pretended\nto be aware of all the details of your show.",
    "But equally I\u2019ve got\nsomething up my sleeve that you don\u2019t know about.",
    "And that\u2019s where I\nmean to score.",
    "Danvers was a damned clever fellow\u201d He broke off as\nif he had said too much.",
    "But the German\u2019s face had lightened a little.",
    "\u201cDanvers\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d He paused a minute then waved to\nConrad.",
    "\u201cTake him away.",
    "Upstairsyou know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cWhat about the girl\u201d\n\n\u201cThat may perhaps be arranged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will see about it.",
    "Only one person can decide that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u201d asked Tommy.",
    "But he knew the answer.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Brown\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I see him\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome\u201d said Conrad harshly.",
    "Tommy rose obediently.",
    "Outside the door his gaoler motioned to him to\nmount the stairs.",
    "He himself followed close behind.",
    "On the floor above\nConrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a small room.",
    "Conrad lit a\nhissing gas burner and went out.",
    "Tommy heard the sound of the key being\nturned in the lock.",
    "He set to work to examine his prison.",
    "It was a smaller room than the\none downstairs and there was something peculiarly airless about the\natmosphere of it.",
    "Then he realized that there was no window.",
    "He walked\nround it.",
    "The walls were filthily dirty as everywhere else.",
    "Four\npictures hung crookedly on the wall representing scenes from Faust.",
    "Marguerite with her box of jewels the church scene Siebel and his\nflowers and Faust and Mephistopheles.",
    "The latter brought Tommy\u2019s mind\nback to Mr. Brown again.",
    "In this sealed and closed chamber with its\nclosefitting heavy door he felt cut off from the world and the\nsinister power of the archcriminal seemed more real.",
    "Shout as he would\nno one could ever hear him.",
    "The place was a living tomb....\n\nWith an effort Tommy pulled himself together.",
    "He sank on to the bed\nand gave himself up to reflection.",
    "His head ached badly also he was\nhungry.",
    "The silence of the place was dispiriting.",
    "\u201cAnyway\u201d said Tommy trying to cheer himself \u201cI shall see the\nchiefthe mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in bluffing I\nshall see the mysterious Jane Finn also.",
    "After that\u201d\n\nAfter that Tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary.",
    "CHAPTER XVII.",
    "ANNETTE\n\nTHE troubles of the future however soon faded before the troubles of\nthe present.",
    "And of these the most immediate and pressing was that of\nhunger.",
    "Tommy had a healthy and vigorous appetite.",
    "The steak and\nchips partaken of for lunch seemed now to belong to another decade.",
    "He\nregretfully recognized the fact that he would not make a success of a\nhunger strike.",
    "He prowled aimlessly about his prison.",
    "Once or twice he discarded\ndignity and pounded on the door.",
    "But nobody answered the summons.",
    "\u201cHang it all\u201d said Tommy indignantly.",
    "\u201cThey can\u2019t mean to starve me\nto death.\u201d A newborn fear passed through his mind that this might\nperhaps be one of those \u201cpretty ways\u201d of making a prisoner speak which\nhad been attributed to Boris.",
    "But on reflection he dismissed the idea.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s that sourfaced brute Conrad\u201d he decided.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a fellow I\nshall enjoy getting even with one of these days.",
    "This is just a bit of\nspite on his part.",
    "I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d\n\nFurther meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be\nextremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on Conrad\u2019s\neggshaped head.",
    "Tommy stroked his own head tenderly and gave himself\nup to the pleasures of imagination.",
    "Finally a bright idea flashed\nacross his brain.",
    "Why not convert imagination into reality Conrad\nwas undoubtedly the tenant of the house.",
    "The others with the possible\nexception of the bearded German merely used it as a rendezvous.",
    "Therefore why not wait in ambush for Conrad behind the door and when\nhe entered bring down a chair or one of the decrepit pictures smartly\non to his head.",
    "One would of course be careful not to hit too hard.",
    "And thenand then simply walk out If he met anyone on the way down\nwell Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists.",
    "Such an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter\nof this afternoon.",
    "Intoxicated by his plan Tommy gently unhooked the\npicture of the Devil and Faust and settled himself in position.",
    "His\nhopes were high.",
    "The plan seemed to him simple but excellent.",
    "Time went on but Conrad did not appear.",
    "Night and day were the same\nin this prison room but Tommy\u2019s wristwatch which enjoyed a certain\ndegree of accuracy informed him that it was nine o\u2019clock in the\nevening.",
    "Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon\nit would be a question of waiting for breakfast.",
    "At ten o\u2019clock hope\ndeserted him and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in\nsleep.",
    "In five minutes his woes were forgotten.",
    "The sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his slumbers.",
    "Not belonging to the type of hero who is famous for awaking in full\npossession of his faculties Tommy merely blinked at the ceiling and\nwondered vaguely where he was.",
    "Then he remembered and looked at his\nwatch.",
    "It was eight o\u2019clock.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s either early morning tea or breakfast\u201d deduced the young man\n\u201cand pray God it\u2019s the latter\u201d\n\nThe door swung open.",
    "Too late Tommy remembered his scheme of\nobliterating the unprepossessing Conrad.",
    "A moment later he was glad that\nhe had for it was not Conrad who entered but a girl.",
    "She carried a\ntray which she set down on the table.",
    "In the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her.",
    "He decided\nat once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen.",
    "Her hair was a full rich brown with sudden glints of gold in it as\nthough there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths.",
    "There\nwas a wildrose quality about her face.",
    "Her eyes set wide apart were\nhazel a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams.",
    "A delirious thought shot through Tommy\u2019s mind.",
    "\u201cAre you Jane Finn\u201d he asked breathlessly.",
    "The girl shook her head wonderingly.",
    "\u201cMy name is Annette monsieur.\u201d\n\nShe spoke in a soft broken English.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d said Tommy rather taken aback.",
    "\u201cFran\u00e7aise\u201d he hazarded.",
    "\u201cOui monsieur.",
    "Monsieur parle fran\u00e7ais\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for any length of time\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s that Breakfast\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded.",
    "Tommy dropped off the bed and came and inspected the\ncontents of the tray.",
    "It consisted of a loaf some margarine and a jug\nof coffee.",
    "\u201cThe living is not equal to the Ritz\u201d he observed with a sigh.",
    "\u201cBut\nfor what we are at last about to receive the Lord has made me truly\nthankful.",
    "Amen.\u201d\n\nHe drew up a chair and the girl turned away to the door.",
    "\u201cWait a sec\u201d cried Tommy.",
    "\u201cThere are lots of things I want to ask you\nAnnette.",
    "What are you doing in this house Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re Conrad\u2019s\nniece or daughter or anything because I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do the service monsieur.",
    "I am not related to anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cYou know what I asked you just now.",
    "Have you ever\nheard that name\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard people speak of Jane Finn I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know where she is\u201d\n\nAnnette shook her head.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s not in this house for instance\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no monsieur.",
    "I must go nowthey will be waiting for me.\u201d\n\nShe hurried out.",
    "The key turned in the lock.",

    "\u201cWith a bit of luck that girl might help me to get out of\nhere.",
    "She doesn\u2019t look like one of the gang.\u201d\n\nAt one o\u2019clock Annette reappeared with another tray but this time\nConrad accompanied her.",
    "\u201cGood morning\u201d said Tommy amiably.",
    "\u201cYou have not used Pear\u2019s soap I\nsee.\u201d\n\nConrad growled threateningly.",

    "What have we for lunch Stew How did I\nknow Elementary my dear Watsonthe smell of onions is unmistakable.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk away\u201d grunted the man.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s little enough time you\u2019ll have to\ntalk in maybe.\u201d\n\nThe remark was unpleasant in its suggestion but Tommy ignored it.",
    "He\nsat down at the table.",

    "\u201cPrate not to thy\nbetters.\u201d\n\nThat evening Tommy sat on the bed and cogitated deeply.",
    "Would Conrad\nagain accompany the girl If he did not should he risk trying to make\nan ally of her He decided that he must leave no stone unturned.",
    "His\nposition was desperate.",
    "At eight o\u2019clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him spring\nto his feet.",
    "The girl was alone.",
    "\u201cShut the door\u201d he commanded.",
    "\u201cI want to speak to you.\u201d She obeyed.",
    "\u201cLook here Annette I want you to help me get out of this.\u201d She shook\nher head.",
    "\u201cImpossible.",
    "There are three of them on the floor below.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d Tommy was secretly grateful for the information.",
    "\u201cBut you would\nhelp me if you could\u201d\n\n\u201cNo monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not\u201d\n\nThe girl hesitated.",
    "\u201cI thinkthey are my own people.",
    "You have spied upon them.",
    "They are\nquite right to keep you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a bad lot Annette.",
    "If you\u2019ll help me I\u2019ll take you away from\nthe lot of them.",
    "And you\u2019d probably get a good whack of money.\u201d\n\nBut the girl merely shook her head.",
    "\u201cI dare not monsieur I am afraid of them.\u201d\n\nShe turned away.",
    "\u201cWouldn\u2019t you do anything to help another girl\u201d cried Tommy.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s\nabout your age too.",

    "\u201cJane Finn.",
    "Always I hear that name.",
    "It is familiar.\u201d\n\nTommy came forward eagerly.",
    "\u201cYou must know something about her\u201d\n\nBut the girl turned away abruptly.",
    "\u201cI know nothingonly the name.\u201d She walked towards the door.",
    "Suddenly\nshe uttered a cry.",
    "Tommy stared.",
    "She had caught sight of the picture\nhe had laid against the wall the night before.",
    "For a moment he caught a\nlook of terror in her eyes.",
    "As inexplicably it changed to relief.",
    "Then\nabruptly she went out of the room.",
    "Tommy could make nothing of it.",
    "Did\nshe fancy that he had meant to attack her with it Surely not.",
    "He rehung\nthe picture on the wall thoughtfully.",
    "Three more days went by in dreary inaction.",
    "Tommy felt the strain\ntelling on his nerves.",
    "He saw no one but Conrad and Annette and the\ngirl had become dumb.",
    "She spoke only in monosyllables.",
    "A kind of dark\nsuspicion smouldered in her eyes.",
    "Tommy felt that if this solitary\nconfinement went on much longer he would go mad.",
    "He gathered from Conrad\nthat they were waiting for orders from \u201cMr.",
    "Brown.\u201d Perhaps thought\nTommy he was abroad or away and they were obliged to wait for his\nreturn.",
    "But the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening.",
    "It was barely seven o\u2019clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps outside\nin the passage.",
    "In another minute the door was flung open.",
    "Conrad\nentered.",
    "With him was the evillooking Number 14.",
    "Tommy\u2019s heart sank at\nthe sight of them.",
    "\u201cEvenin\u2019 gov\u2019nor\u201d said the man with a leer.",
    "\u201cGot those ropes mate\u201d\n\nThe silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord.",
    "The next minute Number\n14\u2019s hands horribly dexterous were winding the cord round his limbs\nwhile Conrad held him down.",
    "\u201cWhat the devil\u201d began Tommy.",
    "But the slow speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the words on\nhis lips.",
    "Number 14 proceeded deftly with his task.",
    "In another minute Tommy was a\nmere helpless bundle.",
    "Then at last Conrad spoke\n\n\u201cThought you\u2019d bluffed us did you With what you knew and what you\ndidn\u2019t know.",
    "Bargained with us And all the time it was bluff Bluff\nYou know less than a kitten.",
    "But your number\u2019s up now all right you\nb swine.\u201d\n\nTommy lay silent.",
    "There was nothing to say.",
    "He had failed.",
    "Somehow\nor other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his pretensions.",

    "\u201cWith pleasure\u201d replied Tommy.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re making a sad mistakebut yours\nwill be the loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t kid us that way again\u201d said Number 14.",
    "\u201cTalking as though\nyou were still at the blooming Ritz aren\u2019t you\u201d\n\nTommy made no reply.",
    "He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown had\ndiscovered his identity.",
    "He decided that Tuppence in the throes of\nanxiety had gone to the police and that his disappearance having been\nmade public the gang had not been slow to put two and two together.",
    "The two men departed and the door slammed.",
    "Tommy was left to his\nmeditations.",
    "They were not pleasant ones.",
    "Already his limbs felt cramped\nand stiff.",
    "He was utterly helpless and he could see no hope anywhere.",
    "About an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned and the\ndoor opened.",
    "It was Annette.",
    "Tommy\u2019s heart beat a little faster.",
    "He had\nforgotten the girl.",
    "Was it possible that she had come to his help\n\nSuddenly he heard Conrad\u2019s voice\n\n\u201cCome out of it Annette.",
    "He doesn\u2019t want any supper tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOui oui je sais bien.",
    "But I must take the other tray.",
    "We need the\nthings on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell hurry up\u201d growled Conrad.",
    "Without looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table and picked up\nthe tray.",
    "She raised a hand and turned out the light.",
    "\u201cCurse you\u201dConrad had come to the door\u201cwhy did you do that\u201d\n\n\u201cI always turn it out.",
    "You should have told me.",
    "Shall I relight it\nMonsieur Conrad\u201d\n\n\u201cNo come on out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLe beau petit monsieur\u201d cried Annette pausing by the bed in the\ndarkness.",
    "\u201cYou have tied him up well hein He is like a trussed\nchicken\u201d The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy but at\nthat moment to his amazement he felt her hand running lightly over\nhis bonds and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his\nhand.",
    "\u201cCome on Annette.\u201d\n\n\u201cMais me voil\u00e0.\u201d\n\nThe door shut.",
    "Tommy heard Conrad say\n\n\u201cLock it and give me the key.\u201d\n\nThe footsteps died away.",
    "Tommy lay petrified with amazement.",
    "The object\nAnnette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife the blade open.",
    "From the way she had studiously avoided looking at him and her action\nwith the light he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked.",
    "There must be a peephole somewhere in the walls.",
    "Remembering how\nguarded she had always been in her manner he saw that he had probably\nbeen under observation all the time.",
    "Had he said anything to give\nhimself away Hardly.",
    "He had revealed a wish to escape and a desire\nto find Jane Finn but nothing that could have given a clue to his\nown identity.",
    "True his question to Annette had proved that he was\npersonally unacquainted with Jane Finn but he had never pretended\notherwise.",
    "The question now was did Annette really know more Were her\ndenials intended primarily for the listeners On that point he could\ncome to no conclusion.",
    "But there was a more vital question that drove out all others.",
    "Could he\nbound as he was manage to cut his bonds He essayed cautiously to\nrub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists\ntogether.",
    "It was an awkward business and drew a smothered \u201cOw\u201d of pain\nfrom him as the knife cut into his wrist.",
    "But slowly and doggedly he\nwent on sawing to and fro.",
    "He cut the flesh badly but at last he felt\nthe cord slacken.",
    "With his hands free the rest was easy.",
    "Five minutes\nlater he stood upright with some difficulty owing to the cramp in his\nlimbs.",
    "His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist.",
    "Then he sat on\nthe edge of the bed to think.",
    "Conrad had taken the key of the door so\nhe could expect little more assistance from Annette.",
    "The only outlet\nfrom the room was the door consequently he would perforce have to wait\nuntil the two men returned to fetch him.",
    "But when they did.... Tommy\nsmiled Moving with infinite caution in the dark room he found and\nunhooked the famous picture.",
    "He felt an economical pleasure that his\nfirst plan would not be wasted.",
    "There was now nothing to do but to wait.",
    "He waited.",
    "The night passed slowly.",
    "Tommy lived through an eternity of hours but\nat last he heard footsteps.",
    "He stood upright drew a deep breath and\nclutched the picture firmly.",
    "The door opened.",
    "A faint light streamed in from outside.",
    "Conrad went\nstraight towards the gas to light it.",
    "Tommy deeply regretted that it was\nhe who had entered first.",
    "It would have been pleasant to get even with\nConrad.",
    "Number 14 followed.",
    "As he stepped across the threshold Tommy\nbrought the picture down with terrific force on his head.",
    "Number 14 went\ndown amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass.",
    "In a minute Tommy had\nslipped out and pulled to the door.",
    "The key was in the lock.",
    "He turned\nit and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from\nthe inside with a volley of curses.",
    "For a moment Tommy hesitated.",
    "There was the sound of some one stirring\non the floor below.",
    "Then the German\u2019s voice came up the stairs.",
    "\u201cGott im Himmel Conrad what is it\u201d\n\nTommy felt a small hand thrust into his.",
    "Beside him stood Annette.",
    "She\npointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to some attics.",
    "\u201cQuickup here\u201d She dragged him after her up the ladder.",
    "In another\nmoment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber.",
    "Tommy\nlooked round.",
    "\u201cThis won\u2019t do.",
    "It\u2019s a regular trap.",
    "There\u2019s no way out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHush Wait.\u201d The girl put her finger to her lips.",
    "She crept to the top\nof the ladder and listened.",
    "The banging and beating on the door was terrific.",
    "The German and another\nwere trying to force the door in.",
    "Annette explained in a whisper\n\n\u201cThey will think you are still inside.",
    "They cannot hear what Conrad\nsays.",
    "The door is too thick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you could hear what went on in the room\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a peephole into the next room.",
    "It was clever of you to guess.",
    "But they will not think of thatthey are only anxious to get in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesbut look here\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d She bent down.",
    "To his amazement Tommy saw that she\nwas fastening the end of a long piece of string to the handle of a big\ncracked jug.",
    "She arranged it carefully then turned to Tommy.",
    "\u201cHave you the key of the door\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it to me.\u201d\n\nHe handed it to her.",
    "\u201cI am going down.",
    "Do you think you can go halfway and then swing\nyourself down behind the ladder so that they will not see you\u201d\n\nTommy nodded.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing.",
    "Stand behind it.",
    "Take the end of this string in your hand.",
    "When I\u2019ve let the others out\npull \u201d\n\nBefore he had time to ask her anything more she had flitted lightly\ndown the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a loud cry\n\n\u201cMon Dieu Mon Dieu Qu\u2019estce qu\u2019il y a\u201d\n\nThe German turned on her with an oath.",
    "\u201cGet out of this.",
    "Go to your room\u201d\n\nVery cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder.",
    "So\nlong as they did not turn round ... all was well.",
    "He crouched behind the\ncupboard.",
    "They were still between him and the stairs.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d Annette appeared to stumble over something.",
    "She stooped.",
    "\u201cMon\nDieu voil\u00e0 la clef\u201d\n\nThe German snatched it from her.",
    "He unlocked the door.",
    "Conrad stumbled\nout swearing.",
    "\u201cWhere is he Have you got him\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have seen no one\u201d said the German sharply.",
    "His face paled.",
    "\u201cWho do\nyou mean\u201d\n\nConrad gave vent to another oath.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s got away.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible.",
    "He would have passed us.\u201d\n\nAt that moment with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string.",
    "A crash\nof crockery came from the attic above.",
    "In a trice the men were pushing\neach other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared into the darkness\nabove.",
    "Quick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hidingplace and dashed down the\nstairs pulling the girl with him.",
    "There was no one in the hall.",
    "He\nfumbled over the bolts and chain.",
    "At last they yielded the door swung\nopen.",
    "He turned.",
    "Annette had disappeared.",
    "Tommy stood spellbound.",
    "Had she run upstairs again What madness\npossessed her He fumed with impatience but he stood his ground.",
    "He\nwould not go without her.",
    "And suddenly there was an outcry overhead an exclamation from the\nGerman and then Annette\u2019s voice clear and high\n\n\u201cMa foi he has escaped And quickly Who would have thought it\u201d\n\nTommy still stood rooted to the ground.",
    "Was that a command to him to go\nHe fancied it was.",
    "And then louder still the words floated down to him\n\n\u201cThis is a terrible house.",
    "I want to go back to Marguerite.",
    "To\nMarguerite.",
    "To Marguerite\u201d\n\nTommy had run back to the stairs.",
    "She wanted him to go and leave her.",
    "But why At all costs he must try and get her away with him.",
    "Then his\nheart sank.",
    "Conrad was leaping down the stairs uttering a savage cry at\nthe sight of him.",
    "After him came the others.",
    "Tommy stopped Conrad\u2019s rush with a straight blow with his fist.",
    "It\ncaught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a log.",
    "The\nsecond man tripped over his body and fell.",
    "From higher up the staircase\nthere was a flash and a bullet grazed Tommy\u2019s ear.",
    "He realized that\nit would be good for his health to get out of this house as soon as\npossible.",
    "As regards Annette he could do nothing.",
    "He had got even with\nConrad which was one satisfaction.",
    "The blow had been a good one.",
    "He leapt for the door slamming it behind him.",
    "The square was deserted.",
    "In front of the house was a baker\u2019s van.",
    "Evidently he was to have been\ntaken out of London in that and his body found many miles from the\nhouse in Soho.",
    "The driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar\nTommy\u2019s way.",
    "Again Tommy\u2019s fist shot out and the driver sprawled on the\npavement.",
    "Tommy took to his heels and rannone too soon.",
    "The front door opened\nand a hail of bullets followed him.",
    "Fortunately none of them hit him.",
    "He\nturned the corner of the square.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s one thing\u201d he thought to himself \u201cthey can\u2019t go on shooting.",
    "They\u2019ll have the police after them if they do.",
    "I wonder they dared to\nthere.\u201d\n\nHe heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him and redoubled his own\npace.",
    "Once he got out of these byways he would be safe.",
    "There would be\na policeman about somewherenot that he really wanted to invoke the aid\nof the police if he could possibly do without it.",
    "It meant explanations\nand general awkwardness.",
    "In another moment he had reason to bless his\nluck.",
    "He stumbled over a prostrate figure which started up with a yell\nof alarm and dashed off down the street.",
    "Tommy drew back into a doorway.",
    "In a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers of whom the\nGerman was one industriously tracking down the red herring\n\nTommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments to\nelapse while he recovered his breath.",
    "Then he strolled gently in the\nopposite direction.",
    "He glanced at his watch.",
    "It was a little after\nhalfpast five.",
    "It was rapidly growing light.",
    "At the next corner he\npassed a policeman.",
    "The policeman cast a suspicious eye on him.",
    "Tommy\nfelt slightly offended.",
    "Then passing his hand over his face he\nlaughed.",
    "He had not shaved or washed for three days What a guy he must\nlook.",
    "He betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath establishment which\nhe knew to be open all night.",
    "He emerged into the busy daylight feeling\nhimself once more and able to make plans.",
    "First of all he must have a square meal.",
    "He had eaten nothing since\nmidday yesterday.",
    "He turned into an A.B.C.",
    "shop and ordered eggs and\nbacon and coffee.",
    "Whilst he ate he read a morning paper propped up\nin front of him.",
    "Suddenly he stiffened.",
    "There was a long article on\nKramenin who was described as the \u201cman behind Bolshevism\u201d in Russia\nand who had just arrived in Londonsome thought as an unofficial envoy.",
    "His career was sketched lightly and it was firmly asserted that he\nand not the figurehead leaders had been the author of the Russian\nRevolution.",
    "In the centre of the page was his portrait.",
    "\u201cSo that\u2019s who Number 1 is\u201d said Tommy with his mouth full of eggs and\nbacon.",
    "\u201cNot a doubt about it I must push on.\u201d\n\nHe paid for his breakfast and betook himself to Whitehall.",
    "There he\nsent up his name and the message that it was urgent.",
    "A few minutes\nlater he was in the presence of the man who did not here go by the name\nof \u201cMr.",
    "Carter.\u201d There was a frown on his face.",
    "\u201cLook here you\u2019ve no business to come asking for me in this way.",
    "I\nthought that was distinctly understood\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was sir.",
    "But I judged it important to lose no time.\u201d\n\nAnd as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the experiences of\nthe last few days.",
    "Halfway through Mr. Carter interrupted him to give a few cryptic\norders through the telephone.",
    "All traces of displeasure had now left his\nface.",
    "He nodded energetically when Tommy had finished.",
    "\u201cQuite right.",
    "Every moment\u2019s of value.",
    "Fear we shall be too late anyway.",
    "They wouldn\u2019t wait.",
    "Would clear out at once.",
    "Still they may have left\nsomething behind them that will be a clue.",
    "You say you\u2019ve recognized\nNumber 1 to be Kramenin That\u2019s important.",
    "We want something against him\nbadly to prevent the Cabinet falling on his neck too freely.",
    "What about\nthe others You say two faces were familiar to you One\u2019s a Labour man\nyou think Just look through these photos and see if you can spot him.\u201d\n\nA minute later Tommy held one up.",
    "Mr. Carter exhibited some surprise.",
    "\u201cAh Westway Shouldn\u2019t have thought it.",
    "Poses as being moderate.",
    "As for\nthe other fellow I think I can give a good guess.\u201d He handed another\nphotograph to Tommy and smiled at the other\u2019s exclamation.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m right\nthen.",
    "Who is he Irishman.",
    "Prominent Unionist M.P.",
    "All a blind of\ncourse.",
    "We\u2019ve suspected itbut couldn\u2019t get any proof.",
    "Yes you\u2019ve done\nvery well young man.",
    "The 29th you say is the date.",
    "That gives us very\nlittle timevery little time indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u201d Tommy hesitated.",
    "Mr. Carter read his thoughts.",
    "\u201cWe can deal with the General Strike menace I think.",
    "It\u2019s a\ntossupbut we\u2019ve got a sporting chance But if that draft treaty turns\nupwe\u2019re done.",
    "England will be plunged in anarchy.",
    "Ah what\u2019s that\nThe car Come on Beresford we\u2019ll go and have a look at this house of\nyours.\u201d\n\nTwo constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho.",
    "An inspector\nreported to Mr. Carter in a low voice.",
    "The latter turned to Tommy.",
    "\u201cThe birds have flownas we thought.",
    "We might as well go over it.\u201d\n\nGoing over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the\ncharacter of a dream.",
    "Everything was just as it had been.",
    "The prison\nroom with the crooked pictures the broken jug in the attic the meeting\nroom with its long table.",
    "But nowhere was there a trace of papers.",
    "Everything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away.",
    "And\nthere was no sign of Annette.",
    "\u201cWhat you tell me about the girl puzzled me\u201d said Mr. Carter.",
    "\u201cYou\nbelieve that she deliberately went back\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would seem so sir.",
    "She ran upstairs while I was getting the door\nopen.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m she must belong to the gang then but being a woman didn\u2019t feel\nlike standing by to see a personable young man killed.",
    "But evidently\nshe\u2019s in with them or she wouldn\u2019t have gone back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s really one of them sir.",
    "Sheseemed so\ndifferent\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodlooking I suppose\u201d said Mr. Carter with a smile that made Tommy\nflush to the roots of his hair.",
    "He admitted Annette\u2019s beauty rather\nshamefacedly.",
    "\u201cBy the way\u201d observed Mr. Carter \u201chave you shown yourself to Miss\nTuppence yet She\u2019s been bombarding me with letters about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTuppence I was afraid she might get a bit rattled.",
    "Did she go to the\npolice\u201d\n\nMr. Carter shook his head.",
    "\u201cThen I wonder how they twigged me.\u201d\n\nMr. Carter looked inquiringly at him and Tommy explained.",

    "Ceilings leaking and all.",
    "\u2018Twould need a lot\nof money spent on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks\u201d said Tommy cheerily.",
    "\u201cI dare say it\u2019ll be a washout but\nhouses are scarce nowadays.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat they are\u201d declared the woman heartily.",

    "It\u2019s all the war.",
    "Upset things terribly it has.",
    "But excuse me\nsir it\u2019ll be too dark for you to see much of the house.",
    "Hadn\u2019t you\nbetter wait until tomorrow\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right.",
    "We\u2019ll have a look around this evening anyway.",
    "We\u2019d\nhave been here before only we lost our way.",
    "What\u2019s the best place to\nstay at for the night round here\u201d\n\nMrs. Sweeny looked doubtful.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s the Yorkshire Arms but it\u2019s not much of a place for\ngentlemen like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it will do very well.",
    "Thanks.",
    "By the way you\u2019ve not had a young\nlady here asking for this key today\u201d\n\nThe woman shook her head.",
    "\u201cNo one\u2019s been over the place for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks very much.\u201d\n\nThey retraced their steps to the Moat House.",
    "As the front door swung\nback on its hinges protesting loudly Julius struck a match and\nexamined the floor carefully.",
    "Then he shook his head.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d swear no one\u2019s passed this way.",
    "Look at the dust.",
    "Thick.",
    "Not a sign\nof a footmark.\u201d\n\nThey wandered round the deserted house.",
    "Everywhere the same tale.",
    "Thick\nlayers of dust apparently undisturbed.",
    "\u201cThis gets me\u201d said Julius.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t believe Tuppence was ever in this\nhouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe must have been.\u201d\n\nJulius shook his head without replying.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll go over it again tomorrow\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll see more\nin the daylight.\u201d\n\nOn the morrow they took up the search once more and were reluctantly\nforced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some\nconsiderable time.",
    "They might have left the village altogether but for\na fortunate discovery of Tommy\u2019s.",
    "As they were retracing their steps to\nthe gate he gave a sudden cry and stooping picked something up from\namong the leaves and held it out to Julius.",
    "It was a small gold brooch.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s Tuppence\u2019s\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely.",
    "I\u2019ve often seen her wear it.\u201d\n\nJulius drew a deep breath.",
    "\u201cI guess that settles it.",
    "She came as far as here anyway.",
    "We\u2019ll make\nthat pub our headquarters and raise hell round here until we find her.",
    "Somebody must have seen her.\u201d\n\nForthwith the campaign began.",
    "Tommy and Julius worked separately and\ntogether but the result was the same.",
    "Nobody answering to Tuppence\u2019s\ndescription had been seen in the vicinity.",
    "They were baffledbut not\ndiscouraged.",
    "Finally they altered their tactics.",
    "Tuppence had certainly\nnot remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House.",
    "That pointed\nto her having been overcome and carried away in a car.",
    "They renewed\ninquiries.",
    "Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House\nthat day Again they met with no success.",
    "Julius wired to town for his own car and they scoured the neighbourhood\ndaily with unflagging zeal.",
    "A grey limousine on which they had set high\nhopes was traced to Harrogate and turned out to be the property of a\nhighly respectable maiden lady\n\nEach day saw them set out on a new quest.",
    "Julius was like a hound on\nthe leash.",
    "He followed up the slenderest clue.",
    "Every car that had passed\nthrough the village on the fateful day was tracked down.",
    "He forced his\nway into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to\na searching crossexamination.",
    "His apologies were as thorough as his\nmethods and seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims\nbut as day succeeded day they were no nearer to discovering Tuppence\u2019s\nwhereabouts.",
    "So well had the abduction been planned that the girl seemed\nliterally to have vanished into thin air.",
    "And another preoccupation was weighing on Tommy\u2019s mind.",
    "\u201cDo you know how long we\u2019ve been here\u201d he asked one morning as they\nsat facing each other at breakfast.",
    "\u201cA week We\u2019re no nearer to finding\nTuppence and next Sunday is the 29th\u201d\n\n\u201cShucks\u201d said Julius thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten about the\n29th.",
    "I\u2019ve been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo have I.",
    "At least I hadn\u2019t forgotten about the 29th but it didn\u2019t\nseem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence.",
    "But today\u2019s\nthe 23rd and time\u2019s getting short.",
    "If we\u2019re ever going to get hold of\nher at all we must do it before the 29thher life won\u2019t be worth an\nhour\u2019s purchase afterwards.",
    "The hostage game will be played out by then.",
    "I\u2019m beginning to feel that we\u2019ve made a big mistake in the way we\u2019ve set\nabout this.",
    "We\u2019ve wasted time and we\u2019re no forrader.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with you there.",
    "We\u2019ve been a couple of mutts who\u2019ve bitten off a\nbigger bit than they can chew.",
    "I\u2019m going to quit fooling right away\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you.",
    "I\u2019m going to do what we ought to have done a week ago.",
    "I\u2019m going right back to London to put the case in the hands of your\nBritish police.",
    "We fancied ourselves as sleuths.",
    "Sleuths It was a piece\nof damnfool foolishness I\u2019m through I\u2019ve had enough of it.",
    "Scotland\nYard for me\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d said Tommy slowly.",
    "\u201cI wish to God we\u2019d gone there right\naway.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter late than never.",
    "We\u2019ve been like a couple of babes playing \u2018Here\nwe go round the Mulberry Bush.\u2019 Now I\u2019m going right along to Scotland\nYard to ask them to take me by the hand and show me the way I should go.",
    "I guess the professional always scores over the amateur in the end.",
    "Are\nyou coming along with me\u201d\n\nTommy shook his head.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the good One of us is enough.",
    "I might as well stay here and\nnose round a bit longer.",
    "Something might turn up.",
    "One never knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing.",
    "Well so long.",
    "I\u2019ll be back in a couple of shakes with a\nfew inspectors along.",
    "I shall tell them to pick out their brightest and\nbest.\u201d\n\nBut the course of events was not to follow the plan Julius had laid\ndown.",
    "Later in the day Tommy received a wire\n\n\u201cJoin me Manchester Midland Hotel.",
    "Important newsJULIUS.\u201d\n\nAt 7.30 that night Tommy alighted from a slow crosscountry train.",
    "Julius was on the platform.",
    "\u201cThought you\u2019d come by this train if you weren\u2019t out when my wire\narrived.\u201d\n\nTommy grasped him by the arm.",
    "\u201cWhat is it Is Tuppence found\u201d\n\nJulius shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "But I found this waiting in London.",
    "Just arrived.\u201d\n\nHe handed the telegraph form to the other.",
    "Tommy\u2019s eyes opened as he\nread\n\n\u201cJane Finn found.",
    "Come Manchester Midland Hotel immediatelyPEEL\nEDGERTON.\u201d\n\nJulius took the form back and folded it up.",
    "\u201cQueer\u201d he said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI thought that lawyer chap had quit\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.",
    "JANE FINN\n\n\u201cMY train got in half an hour ago\u201d explained Julius as he led the way\nout of the station.",
    "\u201cI reckoned you\u2019d come by this before I left London\nand wired accordingly to Sir James.",
    "He\u2019s booked rooms for us and will\nbe round to dine at eight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat made you think he\u2019d ceased to take any interest in the case\u201d\n asked Tommy curiously.",
    "\u201cWhat he said\u201d replied Julius dryly.",
    "\u201cThe old bird\u2019s as close as an\noyster Like all the darned lot of them he wasn\u2019t going to commit\nhimself till he was sure he could deliver the goods.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder\u201d said Tommy thoughtfully.",
    "Julius turned on him.",
    "\u201cYou wonder what\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether that was his real reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.",
    "You bet your life it was.\u201d\n\nTommy shook his head unconvinced.",
    "Sir James arrived punctually at eight o\u2019clock and Julius introduced\nTommy.",
    "Sir James shook hands with him warmly.",
    "\u201cI am delighted to make your acquaintance Mr. Beresford.",
    "I have heard\nso much about you from Miss Tuppence\u201dhe smiled involuntarily\u201cthat it\nreally seems as though I already know you quite well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you sir\u201d said Tommy with his cheerful grin.",
    "He scanned the\ngreat lawyer eagerly.",
    "Like Tuppence he felt the magnetism of the\nother\u2019s personality.",
    "He was reminded of Mr. Carter.",
    "The two men totally\nunlike so far as physical resemblance went produced a similar effect.",
    "Beneath the weary manner of the one and the professional reserve of the\nother lay the same quality of mind keenedged like a rapier.",
    "In the meantime he was conscious of Sir James\u2019s close scrutiny.",
    "When the\nlawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling that the other had\nread him through and through like an open book.",
    "He could not but wonder\nwhat the final judgment was but there was little chance of learning\nthat.",
    "Sir James took in everything but gave out only what he chose.",
    "A\nproof of that occurred almost at once.",
    "Immediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a flood\nof eager questions.",
    "How had Sir James managed to track the girl Why had\nhe not let them know that he was still working on the case And so on.",
    "Sir James stroked his chin and smiled.",
    "At last he said\n\n\u201cJust so just so.",
    "Well she\u2019s found.",
    "And that\u2019s the great thing isn\u2019t\nit Eh Come now that\u2019s the great thing\u201d\n\n\u201cSure it is.",
    "But just how did you strike her trail Miss Tuppence and I\nthought you\u2019d quit for good and all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him then resumed operations\non his chin.",
    "\u201cYou thought that did you Did you really H\u2019m dear me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I guess I can take it we were wrong\u201d pursued Julius.",
    "\u201cWell I don\u2019t know that I should go so far as to say that.",
    "But it\u2019s\ncertainly fortunate for all parties that we\u2019ve managed to find the young\nlady.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where is she\u201d demanded Julius his thoughts flying off on another\ntack.",
    "\u201cI thought you\u2019d be sure to bring her along\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would hardly be possible\u201d said Sir James gravely.",
    "\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the young lady was knocked down in a street accident and has\nsustained slight injuries to the head.",
    "She was taken to the infirmary\nand on recovering consciousness gave her name as Jane Finn.",
    "WhenahI\nheard that I arranged for her to be removed to the house of a\ndoctora friend of mine and wired at once for you.",
    "She relapsed into\nunconsciousness and has not spoken since.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not seriously hurt\u201d\n\n\u201cOh a bruise and a cut or two really from a medical point of view\nabsurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition.",
    "Her state is\nprobably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering\nher memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come back\u201d cried Julius excitedly.",
    "Sir James tapped the table rather impatiently.",
    "\u201cUndoubtedly Mr. Hersheimmer since she was able to give her real name.",
    "I thought you had appreciated that point.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you just happened to be on the spot\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cSeems quite like\na fairy tale.\u201d\n\nBut Sir James was far too wary to be drawn.",
    "\u201cCoincidences are curious things\u201d he said dryly.",
    "Nevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only suspected.",
    "Sir James\u2019s presence in Manchester was not accidental.",
    "Far from\nabandoning the case as Julius supposed he had by some means of his own\nsuccessfully run the missing girl to earth.",
    "The only thing that puzzled\nTommy was the reason for all this secrecy.",
    "He concluded that it was a\nfoible of the legal mind.",
    "Julius was speaking.",
    "\u201cAfter dinner\u201d he announced \u201cI shall go right away and see Jane.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will be impossible I fear\u201d said Sir James.",
    "\u201cIt is very unlikely\nthey would allow her to see visitors at this time of night.",
    "I should\nsuggest tomorrow morning about ten o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nJulius flushed.",
    "There was something in Sir James which always stirred\nhim to antagonism.",
    "It was a conflict of two masterful personalities.",
    "\u201cAll the same I reckon I\u2019ll go round there tonight and see if I can\u2019t\nginger them up to break through their silly rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be quite useless Mr. Hersheimmer.\u201d\n\nThe words came out like the crack of a pistol and Tommy looked up with\na start.",
    "Julius was nervous and excited.",
    "The hand with which he raised\nhis glass to his lips shook slightly but his eyes held Sir James\u2019s\ndefiantly.",
    "For a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to\nburst into flame but in the end Julius lowered his eyes defeated.",
    "\u201cFor the moment I reckon you\u2019re the boss.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d said the other.",
    "\u201cWe will say ten o\u2019clock then\u201d With\nconsummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy.",
    "\u201cI must confess Mr.\nBeresford that it was something of a surprise to me to see you here\nthis evening.",
    "The last I heard of you was that your friends were in\ngrave anxiety on your behalf.",
    "Nothing had been heard of you for\nsome days and Miss Tuppence was inclined to think you had got into\ndifficulties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had sir\u201d Tommy grinned reminiscently.",
    "\u201cI was never in a tighter\nplace in my life.\u201d\n\nHelped out by questions from Sir James he gave an abbreviated account\nof his adventures.",
    "The lawyer looked at him with renewed interest as he\nbrought the tale to a close.",
    "\u201cYou got yourself out of a tight place very well\u201d he said gravely.",
    "\u201cI\ncongratulate you.",
    "You displayed a great deal of ingenuity and carried\nyour part through well.\u201d\n\nTommy blushed his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t have got away but for the girl sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sir James smiled a little.",
    "\u201cIt was lucky for you she happened\ntoertake a fancy to you.\u201d Tommy appeared about to protest but Sir\nJames went on.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about her being one of the gang I\nsuppose\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not sir.",
    "I thought perhaps they were keeping her there by\nforce but the way she acted didn\u2019t fit in with that.",
    "You see she went\nback to them when she could have got away.\u201d\n\nSir James nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cWhat did she say Something about wanting to be taken to Marguerite\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer.",
    "All her friends spoke of\nher as Rita.",
    "Still I suppose the girl must have been in the habit of\ncalling her by her full name.",
    "And at the moment she was crying out to\nher Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or dying Curious There are one\nor two points that strike me as being obscuretheir sudden change\nof attitude towards yourself for instance.",
    "By the way the house was\nraided of course\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir but they\u2019d all cleared out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaturally\u201d said Sir James dryly.",
    "\u201cAnd not a clue left behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder\u201d The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully.",
    "Something in his voice made Tommy look up.",
    "Would this man\u2019s eyes have\nseen something where theirs had been blind He spoke impulsively\n\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d been there sir to go over the house\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had\u201d said Sir James quietly.",
    "He sat for a moment in silence.",
    "Then he looked up.",
    "\u201cAnd since then What have you been doing\u201d\n\nFor a moment Tommy stared at him.",
    "Then it dawned on him that of course\nthe lawyer did not know.",
    "\u201cI forgot that you didn\u2019t know about Tuppence\u201d he said slowly.",
    "The\nsickening anxiety forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing\nJane Finn was found at last swept over him again.",
    "The lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply.",
    "\u201cHas anything happened to Miss Tuppence\u201d His voice was keenedged.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s disappeared\u201d said Julius.",
    "\u201cWhen\u201d\n\n\u201cA week ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u201d\n\nSir James\u2019s questions fairly shot out.",
    "Between them Tommy and Julius\ngave the history of the last week and their futile search.",
    "Sir James went at once to the root of the matter.",
    "\u201cA wire signed with your name They knew enough of you both for that.",
    "They weren\u2019t sure of how much you had learnt in that house.",
    "Their\nkidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the countermove to your escape.",
    "If\nnecessary they could seal your lips with a threat of what might happen\nto her.\u201d\n\nTommy nodded.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s just what I thought sir.\u201d\n\nSir James looked at him keenly.",
    "\u201cYou had worked that out had you Not\nbadnot at all bad.",
    "The curious thing is that they certainly did not\nknow anything about you when they first held you prisoner.",
    "You are sure\nthat you did not in any way disclose your identity\u201d\n\nTommy shook his head.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s so\u201d said Julius with a nod.",
    "\u201cTherefore I reckon some one put\nthem wiseand not earlier than Sunday afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but who\u201d\n\n\u201cThat almighty omniscient Mr. Brown of course\u201d\n\nThere was a faint note of derision in the American\u2019s voice which made\nSir James look up sharply.",

    "Somehow the whole scene\nseemed unreal.",

    "Sir James spoke first.",
    "\u201cMiss Finn\u201d he said \u201cthis is your cousin Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\u201d\n\nA faint flush flitted over the girl\u2019s face as Julius stepped forward\nand took her hand.",

    "But Tommy caught the tremor in his voice.",
    "\u201cAre you really Uncle Hiram\u2019s son\u201d she asked wonderingly.",

    "\u201cIt\u2019s almost the last thing I\nremember before waking up in the hospital....\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on\u201d said Sir James in his quiet penetrating tones.",

    "Then I tore off\na bit of gorseMy but it did prickand plugged the hole with it so\nthat you\u2019d never guess there was a crevice of any kind there.",
    "Then I\nmarked the place carefully in my own mind so that I\u2019d find it again.",
    "There was a queer boulder in the path just therefor all the world\nlike a dog sitting up begging.",
    "Then I went back to the road.",
    "The car was\nwaiting and I drove back.",
    "I just caught the train.",
    "I was a bit ashamed\nof myself for fancying things maybe but by and by I saw the man\nopposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me and I felt\nscared again and was glad the papers were safe.",
    "I went out in the\ncorridor to get a little air.",
    "I thought I\u2019d slip into another carriage.",
    "But the woman called me back said I\u2019d dropped something and when I\nstooped to look something seemed to hit mehere.\u201d She placed her hand\nto the back of her head.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t remember anything more until I woke up\nin the hospital.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause.",
    "\u201cThank you Miss Finn.\u201d It was Sir James who spoke.",

    "If you start at once I think you can catch the connection.\u201d\n\nTommy looked up puzzled.",
    "\u201cIs there any need to hurry sir Today is only the 24th.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s always well to get up early in the morning\u201d said Julius\nbefore the lawyer had time to reply.",

    "I am due to speak at a meeting at two\no\u2019clock.",
    "It is unfortunate.\u201d\n\nThe reluctance in his tone was very evident.",
    "It was clear on the other\nhand that Julius was easily disposed to put up with the loss of the\nother\u2019s company.",
    "\u201cI guess there\u2019s nothing complicated about this deal\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cJust a game of hideandseek that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so\u201d said Sir James.",
    "\u201cSure thing.",
    "What else could it be\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are still young Mr. Hersheimmer.",
    "At my age you will probably have\nlearnt one lesson.",
    "\u2018Never underestimate your adversary.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe gravity of his tone impressed Tommy but had little effect upon\nJulius.",
    "\u201cYou think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand If he does I\u2019m\nready for him.\u201d He slapped his pocket.",
    "\u201cI carry a gun.",
    "Little Willie\nhere travels round with me everywhere.\u201d He produced a murderouslooking\nautomatic and tapped it affectionately before returning it to its\nhome.",
    "\u201cBut he won\u2019t be needed this trip.",
    "There\u2019s nobody to put Mr. Brown\nwise.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cThere was nobody to put Mr. Brown wise to the fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer\nmeant to betray him.",
    "Nevertheless Mrs. Vandemeyer died without\nspeaking.\u201d\n\nJulius was silenced for once and Sir James added on a lighter note\n\n\u201cI only want to put you on your guard.",
    "Goodbye and good luck.",
    "Take\nno unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands.",
    "If there is any\nreason to believe that you have been shadowed destroy them at once.",
    "Good luck to you.",
    "The game is in your hands now.\u201d He shook hands with\nthem both.",
    "Ten minutes later the two young men were seated in a firstclass\ncarriage en route for Chester.",
    "For a long time neither of them spoke.",
    "When at length Julius broke the\nsilence it was with a totally unexpected remark.",
    "\u201cSay\u201d he observed thoughtfully \u201cdid you ever make a darned fool of\nyourself over a girl\u2019s face\u201d\n\nTommy after a moment\u2019s astonishment searched his mind.",
    "\u201cCan\u2019t say I have\u201d he replied at last.",
    "\u201cNot that I can recollect\nanyhow.",
    "Why\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause for the last two months I\u2019ve been making a sentimental idiot of\nmyself over Jane First moment I clapped eyes on her photograph my heart\ndid all the usual stunts you read about in novels.",
    "I guess I\u2019m ashamed\nto admit it but I came over here determined to find her and fix it all\nup and take her back as Mrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d said Tommy amazed.",
    "Julius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued\n\n\u201cJust shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself One look at\nthe girl in the flesh and I was cured\u201d\n\nFeeling more tonguetied than ever Tommy ejaculated \u201cOh\u201d again.",
    "\u201cNo disparagement to Jane mind you\u201d continued the other.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s a real\nnice girl and some fellow will fall in love with her right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought her a very goodlooking girl\u201d said Tommy finding his\ntongue.",
    "\u201cSure she is.",
    "But she\u2019s not like her photo one bit.",
    "At least I suppose\nshe is in a waymust bebecause I recognized her right off.",
    "If I\u2019d\nseen her in a crowd I\u2019d have said \u2018There\u2019s a girl whose face I know\u2019\nright away without any hesitation.",
    "But there was something about that\nphoto\u201dJulius shook his head and heaved a sigh\u201cI guess romance is a\nmighty queer thing\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be\u201d said Tommy coldly \u201cif you can come over here in love with\none girl and propose to another within a fortnight.\u201d\n\nJulius had the grace to look discomposed.",
    "\u201cWell you see I\u2019d got a sort of tired feeling that I\u2019d never find\nJaneand that it was all plumb foolishness anyway.",
    "And thenoh well\nthe French for instance are much more sensible in the way they look at\nthings.",
    "They keep romance and marriage apart\u201d\n\nTommy flushed.",
    "\u201cWell I\u2019m damned If that\u2019s\u201d\n\nJulius hastened to interrupt.",
    "\u201cSay now don\u2019t be hasty.",
    "I don\u2019t mean what you mean.",
    "I take it\nAmericans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even.",
    "What I\nmeant was that the French set about marriage in a businesslike wayfind\ntwo people who are suited to one another look after the money affairs\nand see the whole thing practically and in a businesslike spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask me\u201d said Tommy \u201cwe\u2019re all too damned businesslike\nnowadays.",
    "We\u2019re always saying \u2018Will it pay\u2019 The men are bad enough\nand the girls are worse\u201d\n\n\u201cCool down son.",
    "Don\u2019t get so heated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel heated\u201d said Tommy.",
    "Julius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more.",
    "However Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they reached\nHolyhead and the cheerful grin had returned to his countenance as they\nalighted at their destination.",
    "After consultation and with the aid of a road map they were fairly\nwell agreed as to direction so were able to hire a taxi without more\nado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur Bay.",
    "They instructed\nthe man to go slowly and watched narrowly so as not to miss the path.",
    "They came to it not long after leaving the town and Tommy stopped the\ncar promptly asked in a casual tone whether the path led down to the\nsea and hearing it did paid off the man in handsome style.",
    "A moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead.",
    "Tommy and\nJulius watched it out of sight and then turned to the narrow path.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the right one I suppose\u201d asked Tommy doubtfully.",
    "\u201cThere must be\nsimply heaps along here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure it is.",
    "Look at the gorse.",
    "Remember what Jane said\u201d\n\nTommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which bordered the\npath on either side and was convinced.",
    "They went down in single file Julius leading.",
    "Twice Tommy turned his\nhead uneasily.",
    "Julius looked back.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "I\u2019ve got the wind up somehow.",
    "Keep fancying there\u2019s some\none following us.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be\u201d said Julius positively.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019d see him.\u201d\n\nTommy had to admit that this was true.",
    "Nevertheless his sense of\nuneasiness deepened.",
    "In spite of himself he believed in the omniscience\nof the enemy.",
    "\u201cI rather wish that fellow would come along\u201d said Julius.",
    "He patted his\npocket.",
    "\u201cLittle William here is just aching for exercise\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you always carry ithimwith you\u201d inquired Tommy with burning\ncuriosity.",
    "\u201cMost always.",
    "I guess you never know what might turn up.\u201d\n\nTommy kept a respectful silence.",
    "He was impressed by little William.",
    "It\nseemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther away.",
    "The path was now running along the side of the cliff parallel to the\nsea.",
    "Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy cannoned\ninto him.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s up\u201d he inquired.",
    "\u201cLook there.",
    "If that doesn\u2019t beat the band\u201d\n\nTommy looked.",
    "Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge boulder\nwhich certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a \u201cbegging\u201d terrier.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Tommy refusing to share Julius\u2019s emotion \u201cit\u2019s what we\nexpected to see isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\nJulius looked at him sadly and shook his head.",
    "\u201cBritish phlegm Sure we expected itbut it kind of rattles me all the\nsame to see it sitting there just where we expected to find it\u201d\n\nTommy whose calm was perhaps more assumed than natural moved his\nfeet impatiently.",
    "\u201cPush on.",
    "What about the hole\u201d\n\nThey scanned the cliffside narrowly.",
    "Tommy heard himself saying\nidiotically\n\n\u201cThe gorse won\u2019t be there after all these years.\u201d\n\nAnd Julius replied solemnly\n\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nTommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand.",
    "\u201cWhat about that crevice there\u201d\n\nJulius replied in an awestricken voice\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s itfor sure.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other.",
    "\u201cWhen I was in France\u201d said Tommy reminiscently \u201cwhenever my batman\nfailed to call me he always said that he had come over queer.",
    "I never\nbelieved it.",
    "But whether he felt it or not there is such a sensation.",
    "I\u2019ve got it now Badly\u201d\n\nHe looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion.",
    "\u201cDamn it\u201d he cried.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible Five years Think of it\nBird\u2019snesting boys picnic parties thousands of people passing It\ncan\u2019t be there It\u2019s a hundred to one against its being there It\u2019s\nagainst all reason\u201d\n\nIndeed he felt it to be impossiblemore perhaps because he could not\nbelieve in his own success where so many others had failed.",
    "The thing\nwas too easy therefore it could not be.",
    "The hole would be empty.",
    "Julius looked at him with a widening smile.",
    "\u201cI guess you\u2019re rattled now all right\u201d he drawled with some enjoyment.",
    "\u201cWell here goes\u201d He thrust his hand into the crevice and made a\nslight grimace.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a tight fit.",

    "I don\u2019t feel anythingnosay what\u2019s this Gee\nwhiz\u201d And with a flourish he waved aloft a small discoloured packet.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the goods all right.",
    "Sewn up in oilskin.",
    "Hold it while I get my\npenknife.\u201d\n\nThe unbelievable had happened.",

    "They look just as good as new.\u201d\n\nThey cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin.",
    "Inside was a small\nfolded sheet of paper.",

    "My poor aunt what lives in the country has been mortal bad\nfor a long time and she\u2019s asking for me with her dying breath.\u201d\n\nTommy nodded approval.",
    "\u201cCan you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing Cross\nin an hour\u2019s time\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there sir.",
    "You can count on me.\u201d\n\nAs Tommy had judged the faithful Albert proved an invaluable ally.",
    "The\ntwo took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse.",
    "To Albert fell the\ntask of collecting information.",
    "There was no difficulty about it.",
    "Astley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams.",
    "The doctor no longer\npracticed had retired the landlord believed but he took a few private\npatientshere the good fellow tapped his forehead knowingly\u201cbalmy\nones You understand\u201d The doctor was a popular figure in the village\nsubscribed freely to all the local sports\u201ca very pleasant affable\ngentleman.\u201d Been there long Oh a matter of ten years or somight be\nlonger.",
    "Scientific gentleman he was.",
    "Professors and people often came\ndown from town to see him.",
    "Anyway it was a gay house always visitors.",
    "In the face of all this volubility Tommy felt doubts.",
    "Was it possible\nthat this genial wellknown figure could be in reality a dangerous\ncriminal His life seemed so open and aboveboard.",
    "No hint of sinister\ndoings.",
    "Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake Tommy felt a cold chill\nat the thought.",
    "Then he remembered the private patients\u201cbalmy ones.\u201d He inquired\ncarefully if there was a young lady amongst them describing Tuppence.",
    "But nothing much seemed to be known about the patientsthey were seldom\nseen outside the grounds.",
    "A guarded description of Annette also failed\nto provoke recognition.",
    "Astley Priors was a pleasant redbrick edifice surrounded by\nwellwooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from\nobservation from the road.",
    "On the first evening Tommy accompanied by Albert explored the grounds.",
    "Owing to Albert\u2019s insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on\ntheir stomachs thereby producing a great deal more noise than if\nthey had stood upright.",
    "In any case these precautions were totally\nunnecessary.",
    "The grounds like those of any other private house after\nnightfall seemed untenanted.",
    "Tommy had imagined a possible fierce\nwatchdog.",
    "Albert\u2019s fancy ran to a puma or a tame cobra.",
    "But they\nreached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested.",
    "The blinds of the diningroom window were up.",
    "There was a large company\nassembled round the table.",
    "The port was passing from hand to hand.",
    "It\nseemed a normal pleasant company.",
    "Through the open window scraps of\nconversation floated out disjointedly on the night air.",
    "It was a heated\ndiscussion on county cricket\n\nAgain Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty.",
    "It seemed impossible\nto believe that these people were other than they seemed.",
    "Had he been\nfooled once more The fairbearded spectacled gentleman who sat at the\nhead of the table looked singularly honest and normal.",
    "Tommy slept badly that night.",
    "The following morning the indefatigable\nAlbert having cemented an alliance with the greengrocer\u2019s boy took the\nlatter\u2019s place and ingratiated himself with the cook at Malthouse.",
    "He returned with the information that she was undoubtedly \u201cone of\nthe crooks\u201d but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination.",
    "Questioned he could adduce nothing in support of his statement except\nhis own opinion that she wasn\u2019t the usual kind.",
    "You could see that at a\nglance.",
    "The substitution being repeated much to the pecuniary advantage of the\nreal greengrocer\u2019s boy on the following day Albert brought back the\nfirst piece of hopeful news.",
    "There was a French young lady staying\nin the house.",
    "Tommy put his doubts aside.",
    "Here was confirmation of\nhis theory.",
    "But time pressed.",
    "Today was the 27th.",
    "The 29th was the\nmuchtalkedof \u201cLabour Day\u201d about which all sorts of rumours were\nrunning riot.",
    "Newspapers were getting agitated.",
    "Sensational hints of a\nLabour coup d\u2019\u00e9tat were freely reported.",
    "The Government said nothing.",
    "It knew and was prepared.",
    "There were rumours of dissension among the\nLabour leaders.",
    "They were not of one mind.",
    "The more farseeing among\nthem realized that what they proposed might well be a deathblow to the\nEngland that at heart they loved.",
    "They shrank from the starvation and\nmisery a general strike would entail and were willing to meet the\nGovernment halfway.",
    "But behind them were subtle insistent forces at\nwork urging the memories of old wrongs deprecating the weakness of\nhalfandhalf measures fomenting misunderstandings.",
    "Tommy felt that thanks to Mr. Carter he understood the position fairly\naccurately.",
    "With the fatal document in the hands of Mr. Brown\npublic opinion would swing to the side of the Labour extremists and\nrevolutionists.",
    "Failing that the battle was an even chance.",
    "The\nGovernment with a loyal army and police force behind them might\nwinbut at a cost of great suffering.",
    "But Tommy nourished another and\na preposterous dream.",
    "With Mr. Brown unmasked and captured he\nbelieved rightly or wrongly that the whole organization would crumble\nignominiously and instantaneously.",
    "The strange permeating influence\nof the unseen chief held it together.",
    "Without him Tommy believed an\ninstant panic would set in and the honest men left to themselves an\neleventhhour reconciliation would be possible.",
    "\u201cThis is a oneman show\u201d said Tommy to himself.",
    "\u201cThe thing to do is to\nget hold of the man.\u201d\n\nIt was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had\nrequested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope.",
    "The draft\ntreaty was Tommy\u2019s bait.",
    "Every now and then he was aghast at his own\npresumption.",
    "How dared he think that he had discovered what so many\nwiser and clever men had overlooked Nevertheless he stuck tenaciously\nto his idea.",
    "That evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of Astley\nPriors.",
    "Tommy\u2019s ambition was somehow or other to gain admission to the\nhouse itself.",
    "As they approached cautiously Tommy gave a sudden gasp.",
    "On the second floor window some one standing between the window and\nthe light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind.",
    "It was one Tommy\nwould have recognized anywhere Tuppence was in that house\n\nHe clutched Albert by the shoulder.",
    "\u201cStay here When I begin to sing watch that window.\u201d\n\nHe retreated hastily to a position on the main drive and began in a\ndeep roar coupled with an unsteady gait the following ditty\n\n\n          I am a Soldier\n          A jolly British Soldier\n          You can see that I\u2019m a Soldier by my feet....",
    "It had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence\u2019s hospital days.",
    "He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw her own\nconclusions.",
    "Tommy had not a note of music in his voice but his lungs\nwere excellent.",
    "The noise he produced was terrific.",
    "Presently an unimpeachable butler accompanied by an equally\nunimpeachable footman issued from the front door.",
    "The butler\nremonstrated with him.",
    "Tommy continued to sing addressing the butler\naffectionately as \u201cdear old whiskers.\u201d The footman took him by one arm\nthe butler by the other.",
    "They ran him down the drive and neatly out\nof the gate.",
    "The butler threatened him with the police if he intruded\nagain.",
    "It was beautifully donesoberly and with perfect decorum.",
    "Anyone\nwould have sworn that the butler was a real butler the footman a real\nfootmanonly as it happened the butler was Whittington\n\nTommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert\u2019s return.",
    "At last that\nworthy made his appearance.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d cried Tommy eagerly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all right.",
    "While they was arunning of you out the window opened\nand something was chucked out.\u201d He handed a scrap of paper to Tommy.",
    "\u201cIt\nwas wrapped round a letterweight.\u201d\n\nOn the paper were scrawled three words \u201cTomorrowsame time.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood egg\u201d cried Tommy.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re getting going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote a message on a piece of paper wrapped it round a stone and\nchucked it through the window\u201d continued Albert breathlessly.",
    "Tommy groaned.",
    "\u201cYour zeal will be the undoing of us Albert.",
    "What did you say\u201d\n\n\u201cSaid we was astaying at the inn.",
    "If she could get away to come there\nand croak like a frog.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll know that\u2019s you\u201d said Tommy with a sigh of relief.",
    "\u201cYour\nimagination runs away with you you know Albert.",
    "Why you wouldn\u2019t\nrecognize a frog croaking if you heard it.\u201d\n\nAlbert looked rather crestfallen.",
    "\u201cCheer up\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cNo harm done.",
    "That butler\u2019s an old friend of\nmineI bet he knew who I was though he didn\u2019t let on.",
    "It\u2019s not their\ngame to show suspicion.",
    "That\u2019s why we\u2019ve found it fairly plain sailing.",
    "They don\u2019t want to discourage me altogether.",
    "On the other hand they\ndon\u2019t want to make it too easy.",
    "I\u2019m a pawn in their game Albert that\u2019s\nwhat I am.",
    "You see if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily\nthe fly might suspect it was a putup job.",

    "He had\nelaborated a careful plan for the following evening.",
    "He felt sure that\nthe inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with him up to\na certain point.",
    "It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a\nsurprise.",
    "About twelve o\u2019clock however his calm was rudely shaken.",
    "He was told\nthat some one was demanding him in the bar.",
    "The applicant proved to be a\nrudelooking carter well coated with mud.",
    "\u201cWell my good fellow what is it\u201d asked Tommy.",
    "\u201cMight this be for you sir\u201d The carter held out a very dirty folded\nnote on the outside of which was written \u201cTake this to the gentleman\nat the inn near Astley Priors.",

    "He asked me to take charge of them.",

    "At first I\u2019d\nbeen only grateful to her for being so kind to me but all the time I\nfelt there was something about her I didn\u2019t like and on the Irish\nboat I saw her talking to some queerlooking men and from the way they\nlooked I saw that they were talking about me.",
    "I remembered that she\u2019d\nbeen quite near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave me the\npacket and before that she\u2019d tried to talk to him once or twice.",
    "I\nbegan to get scared but I didn\u2019t quite see what to do.",
    "\u201cI had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead and not going on to London\nthat day but I soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness.",
    "The only\nthing was to act as though I\u2019d noticed nothing and hope for the best.",

    "One thing\nI\u2019d done already as a precautionripped open the oilskin packet and\nsubstituted blank paper and then sewn it up again.",

    "In the end I found myself in\na carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all.",
    "I went out into the corridor\nbut all the other carriages were full so I had to go back and sit down.",
    "I consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the\ncarriagethere was quite a nicelooking man and his wife sitting just\nopposite.",
    "So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London.",
    "I\nhad leaned back and closed my eyes.",
    "I guess they thought I was asleep\nbut my eyes weren\u2019t quite shut and suddenly I saw the nicelooking man\nget something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer and as he\ndid so he winked....\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and through.",
    "My\nonly thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could.",
    "I\ngot up trying to look natural and easy.",
    "Perhaps they saw somethingI\ndon\u2019t knowbut suddenly Mrs. Vandemeyer said \u2018Now\u2019 and flung something\nover my nose and mouth as I tried to scream.",

    "They spoke of\u201dshe closed her\neyes\u201ctorturing me to find out\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never known what fearreally sickening fearwas before Once\nthey came to look at me.",
    "I shut my eyes and pretended to be still\nunconscious but I was afraid they\u2019d hear the beating of my heart.",
    "However they went away again.",
    "I began thinking madly.",
    "What could I do\nI knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand up against torture very long.",

    "I had the whole thing at my fingertips.",
    "If only I could succeed in\ncarrying the bluff through it might save me.",
    "I said a prayer and drew\na long breath.",
    "Then I opened my eyes and started babbling in French\n\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Vandemeyer came round the screen at once.",
    "Her face was so wicked I\nnearly died but I smiled up at her doubtfully and asked her in French\nwhere I was.",
    "\u201cIt puzzled her I could see.",
    "She called the man she had been talking\nto.",
    "He stood by the screen with his face in shadow.",
    "He spoke to me in\nFrench.",
    "His voice was very ordinary and quiet but somehow I don\u2019t know\nwhy he scared me worse than the woman.",
    "I felt he\u2019d seen right through\nme but I went on playing my part.",
    "I asked again where I was and\nthen went on that there was something I must remembermust\nrememberonly for the moment it was all gone.",
    "I worked myself up to\nbe more and more distressed.",
    "He asked me my name.",
    "I said I didn\u2019t\nknowthat I couldn\u2019t remember anything at all.",
    "\u201cSuddenly he caught my wrist and began twisting it.",

    "He went on.",
    "I screamed and screamed but I managed to shriek\nout things in French.",
    "I don\u2019t know how long I could have gone on but\nluckily I fainted.",
    "The last thing I heard was his voice saying \u2018That\u2019s\nnot bluff Anyway a kid of her age wouldn\u2019t know enough.\u2019 I guess he\nforgot American girls are older for their age than English ones and\ntake more interest in scientific subjects.",
    "\u201cWhen I came to Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me.",
    "She\u2019d had her\norders I guess.",

    "She\nlooked relieved when I said that.",
    "\u201cBy and by she went out of the room altogether.",
    "I was suspicious still\nand lay quite quiet for some time.",
    "In the end however I got up and\nwalked round the room examining it.",
    "I thought that even if anyone\nwas watching me from somewhere it would seem natural enough under\nthe circumstances.",
    "It was a squalid dirty place.",
    "There were no windows\nwhich seemed queer.",
    "I guessed the door would be locked but I didn\u2019t\ntry it.",
    "There were some battered old pictures on the walls representing\nscenes from Faust.\u201d\n\nJane\u2019s two listeners gave a simultaneous \u201cAh\u201d The girl nodded.",
    "\u201cYesit was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was imprisoned.",
    "Of\ncourse at the time I didn\u2019t even know if I was in London.",
    "One thing was\nworrying me dreadfully but my heart gave a great throb of relief when\nI saw my ulster lying carelessly over the back of a chair.",
    "And the\nmagazine was still rolled up in the pocket\n\n\u201cIf only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked I looked\ncarefully round the walls.",
    "There didn\u2019t seem to be a peephole of any\nkindnevertheless I felt kind of sure there must be.",
    "All of a sudden I\nsat down on the edge of the table and put my face in my hands sobbing\nout a \u2018Mon Dieu Mon Dieu\u2019 I\u2019ve got very sharp ears.",
    "I distinctly heard\nthe rustle of a dress and slight creak.",
    "That was enough for me.",
    "I was\nbeing watched\n\n\u201cI lay down on the bed again and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer brought me\nsome supper.",
    "She was still sweet as they make them.",
    "I guess she\u2019d been\ntold to win my confidence.",
    "Presently she produced the oilskin packet\nand asked me if I recognized it watching me like a lynx all the time.",
    "\u201cI took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way.",
    "Then I shook my\nhead.",
    "I said that I felt I ought to remember something about it that\nit was just as though it was all coming back and then before I could\nget hold of it it went again.",
    "Then she told me that I was her niece\nand that I was to call her \u2018Aunt Rita.\u2019 I did obediently and she told\nme not to worrymy memory would soon come back.",
    "\u201cThat was an awful night.",
    "I\u2019d made my plan whilst I was waiting for her.",
    "The papers were safe so far but I couldn\u2019t take the risk of leaving\nthem there any longer.",
    "They might throw that magazine away any minute.",
    "I lay awake waiting until I judged it must be about two o\u2019clock in the\nmorning.",
    "Then I got up as softly as I could and felt in the dark along\nthe lefthand wall.",
    "Very gently I unhooked one of the pictures from its\nnailMarguerite with her casket of jewels.",
    "I crept over to my coat and\ntook out the magazine and an odd envelope or two that I had shoved in.",
    "Then I went to the washstand and damped the brown paper at the back\nof the picture all round.",
    "Presently I was able to pull it away.",
    "I had\nalready torn out the two stucktogether pages from the magazine and now\nI slipped them with their precious enclosure between the picture and its\nbrown paper backing.",
    "A little gum from the envelopes helped me to\nstick the latter up again.",
    "No one would dream the picture had ever been\ntampered with.",
    "I rehung it on the wall put the magazine back in my\ncoat pocket and crept back to bed.",
    "I was pleased with my hidingplace.",
    "They\u2019d never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures.",
    "I\nhoped that they\u2019d come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying\na dummy all along and that in the end they\u2019d let me go.",
    "\u201cAs a matter of fact I guess that\u2019s what they did think at first and\nin a way it was dangerous for me.",
    "I learnt afterwards that they nearly\ndid away with me then and therethere was never much chance of their\n\u2018letting me go\u2019but the first man who was the boss preferred to keep\nme alive on the chance of my having hidden them and being able to tell\nwhere if I recovered my memory.",
    "They watched me constantly for weeks.",
    "Sometimes they\u2019d ask me questions by the hourI guess there was nothing\nthey didn\u2019t know about the third degreebut somehow I managed to hold\nmy own.",
    "The strain of it was awful though....\n\n\u201cThey took me back to Ireland and over every step of the journey again\nin case I\u2019d hidden it somewhere en route.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer and another\nwoman never left me for a moment.",
    "They spoke of me as a young relative\nof Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s whose mind was affected by the shock of the\nLusitania.",
    "There was no one I could appeal to for help without\ngiving myself away to them and if I risked it and failedand Mrs.\nVandemeyer looked so rich and so beautifully dressed that I felt\nconvinced they\u2019d take her word against mine and think it was part of my\nmental trouble to think myself \u2018persecuted\u2019I felt that the horrors in\nstore for me would be too awful once they knew I\u2019d been only shamming.\u201d\n\nSir James nodded comprehendingly.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality.",
    "With that and her\nsocial position she would have had little difficulty in imposing her\npoint of view in preference to yours.",
    "Your sensational accusations\nagainst her would not easily have found credence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.",
    "It ended in my being sent to a sanatorium at\nBournemouth.",
    "I couldn\u2019t make up my mind at first whether it was a sham\naffair or genuine.",
    "A hospital nurse had charge of me.",
    "I was a special\npatient.",
    "She seemed so nice and normal that at last I determined to\nconfide in her.",
    "A merciful providence just saved me in time from falling\ninto the trap.",
    "My door happened to be ajar and I heard her talking to\nsome one in the passage.",
    "She was one of them They still fancied it\nmight be a bluff on my part and she was put in charge of me to make\nsure After that my nerve went completely.",
    "I dared trust nobody.",
    "\u201cI think I almost hypnotized myself.",
    "After a while I almost forgot\nthat I was really Jane Finn.",
    "I was so bent on playing the part of Janet\nVandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks.",
    "I became really\nillfor months I sank into a sort of stupor.",
    "I felt sure I should\ndie soon and that nothing really mattered.",
    "A sane person shut up in a\nlunatic asylum often ends by becoming insane they say.",
    "I guess I was\nlike that.",
    "Playing my part had become second nature to me.",
    "I wasn\u2019t even\nunhappy in the endjust apathetic.",
    "Nothing seemed to matter.",
    "And the\nyears went on.",
    "\u201cAnd then suddenly things seemed to change.",
    "Mrs. Vandemeyer came down\nfrom London.",
    "She and the doctor asked me questions experimented with\nvarious treatments.",
    "There was some talk of sending me to a specialist in\nParis.",
    "In the end they did not dare risk it.",
    "I overheard something that\nseemed to show that other peoplefriendswere looking for me.",
    "I\nlearnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to Paris\nand consulted a specialist representing herself to be me.",
    "He put her\nthrough some searching tests and exposed her loss of memory to be\nfraudulent but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced\nthem on me.",
    "I dare say I couldn\u2019t have deceived the specialist for a\nminutea man who has made a lifelong study of a thing is uniquebut\nI managed once again to hold my own with them.",
    "The fact that I\u2019d not\nthought of myself as Jane Finn for so long made it easier.",
    "\u201cOne night I was whisked off to London at a moment\u2019s notice.",
    "They took\nme back to the house in Soho.",
    "Once I got away from the sanatorium I felt\ndifferentas though something in me that had been buried for a long\ntime was waking up again.",
    "\u201cThey sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford.",
    "Of course I didn\u2019t know\nhis name then.",
    "I was suspiciousI thought it was another trap.",
    "But he\nlooked so honest I could hardly believe it.",
    "However I was careful in\nall I said for I knew we could be overheard.",
    "There\u2019s a small hole high\nup in the wall.",
    "\u201cBut on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house.",
    "They\nwere all very disturbed.",
    "Without their knowing I listened.",
    "Word had\ncome that he was to be killed.",
    "I needn\u2019t tell the next part because\nyou know it.",
    "I thought I\u2019d have time to rush up and get the papers from\ntheir hidingplace but I was caught.",
    "So I screamed out that he was\nescaping and I said I wanted to go back to Marguerite.",
    "I shouted the\nname three times very loud.",
    "I knew the others would think I meant\nMrs. Vandemeyer but I hoped it might make Mr. Beresford think of the\npicture.",
    "He\u2019d unhooked one the first daythat\u2019s what made me hesitate\nto trust him.\u201d\n\nShe paused.",
    "\u201cThen the papers\u201d said Sir James slowly \u201care still at the back of the\npicture in that room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the strain of\nthe long story.",
    "Sir James rose to his feet.",
    "He looked at his watch.",
    "\u201cCome\u201d he said \u201cwe must go at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight\u201d queried Tuppence surprised.",

    "\u201cBesides by\ngoing tonight we have the chance of capturing that great man and\nsupercriminalMr.",
    "Brown\u201d\n\nThere was dead silence and Sir James continued\n\n\u201cYou have been followed herenot a doubt of it.",
    "When we leave the house\nwe shall be followed again but not molested for it is Mr. Brown\u2019s\nplan that we are to lead him.",
    "But the Soho house is under police\nsupervision night and day.",
    "There are several men watching it.",
    "When we\nenter that house Mr. Brown will not draw backhe will risk all on the\nchance of obtaining the spark to fire his mine.",
    "And he fancies the risk\nnot greatsince he will enter in the guise of a friend\u201d\n\nTuppence flushed then opened her mouth impulsively.",
    "\u201cBut there\u2019s something you don\u2019t knowthat we haven\u2019t told you.\u201d Her\neyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity.",

    "\u201cNo hesitations Miss Tuppence.",
    "We need to be sure of our going.\u201d\n\nBut Tuppence for once seemed tonguetied.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s so difficultyou see if I\u2019m wrongoh it would be dreadful.\u201d\n She made a grimace at the unconscious Jane.",

    "\u201cAt last I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt last\u201d queried Tuppence doubtfully.",
    "\u201cOh but I thought\u201d She\npaused.",
    "\u201cYou thought correctly Miss Tuppence.",
    "I have been morally certain of\nhis identity for some timeever since the night of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s\nmysterious death.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d breathed Tuppence.",
    "\u201cFor there we are up against the logic of facts.",
    "There are only two\nsolutions.",
    "Either the chloral was administered by her own hand which\ntheory I reject utterly or else\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cOr else it was administered in the brandy you gave her.",
    "Only three\npeople touched that brandyyou Miss Tuppence I myself and one\notherMr.",
    "Julius Hersheimmer\u201d\n\nJane Finn stirred and sat up regarding the speaker with wide astonished\neyes.",
    "\u201cAt first the thing seemed utterly impossible.",
    "Mr. Hersheimmer as the\nson of a prominent millionaire was a wellknown figure in America.",
    "It\nseemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown could be one and the\nsame.",
    "But you cannot escape from the logic of facts.",
    "Since the thing\nwas soit must be accepted.",
    "Remember Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s sudden and\ninexplicable agitation.",
    "Another proof if proof was needed.",
    "\u201cI took an early opportunity of giving you a hint.",
    "From some words of\nMr. Hersheimmer\u2019s at Manchester I gathered that you had understood and\nacted on that hint.",
    "Then I set to work to prove the impossible possible.",
    "Mr. Beresford rang me up and told me what I had already suspected\nthat the photograph of Miss Jane Finn had never really been out of Mr.\nHersheimmer\u2019s possession\u201d\n\nBut the girl interrupted.",
    "Springing to her feet she cried out angrily\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean What are you trying to suggest That Mr. Brown is\nJulius Juliusmy own cousin\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Miss Finn\u201d said Sir James unexpectedly.",
    "\u201cNot your cousin.",

    "He went out West where\nhe obtained news of her and her photograph to aid him in his search.",
    "On\nthe eve of his departure from New York he was set upon and murdered.",
    "His\nbody was dressed in shabby clothes and the face disfigured to prevent\nidentification.",

    "He sailed immediately for\nEngland.",
    "None of the real Hersheimmer\u2019s friends or intimates saw him\nbefore he sailedthough indeed it would hardly have mattered if they\nhad the impersonation was so perfect.",

    "Every secret of theirs has been\nknown to him.",
    "Only once did he come near disaster.",

    "They\u2019ll take care to get him out\nof the way at the right minute.",
    "Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and\nrescues you in true melodramatic style.",
    "Bullets flybut don\u2019t hit\nanybody.",

    "\u201cThat business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius told me\nabout it.",
    "On the face of it it seemed that he or Sir James must have\ndone the trick.",
    "But I didn\u2019t know which.",
    "Finding that photograph in the\ndrawer after that story of how it had been got from him by Inspector\nBrown made me suspect Julius.",
    "Then I remembered that it was Sir James\nwho had discovered the false Jane Finn.",
    "In the end I couldn\u2019t make up\nmy mindand just decided to take no chances either way.",
    "I left a note\nfor Julius in case he was Mr. Brown saying I was off to the Argentine\nand I dropped Sir James\u2019s letter with the offer of the job by the desk\nso that he would see it was a genuine stunt.",
    "Then I wrote my letter to\nMr. Carter and rang up Sir James.",

    "I sent off Albert posthaste to\nMr. Carter.",
    "I pretended to go away but doubled back again.",
    "When Julius\ncame bursting up in his car I felt it wasn\u2019t part of Mr. Brown\u2019s\nplanand that there would probably be trouble.",

    "We got to the Soho house in plenty of time and met\nMr. Carter outside.",
    "After arranging things with him we went in and hid\nbehind the curtain in the recess.",
    "The policemen had orders to say if\nthey were asked that no one had gone into the house.",
    "That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nAnd Tommy came to an abrupt halt.",

    "Why didn\u2019t you\nsay\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess I was a mite suspicious too.",

    "\u201cI\nsuppose secret service work makes you like that\u201d\n\nIn the pause that ensued Mr. Carter took from his pocket a small shabby\nbrown book.",
    "\u201cBeresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James Peel\nEdgerton to be guilty unless so to speak he was caught in the act.",
    "That is so.",
    "Indeed not until I read the entries in this little book\ncould I bring myself fully to credit the amazing truth.",
