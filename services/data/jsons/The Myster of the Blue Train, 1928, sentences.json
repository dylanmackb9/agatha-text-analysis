    "THE MYSTERY OF THE BLUE TRAIN\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nTHE MAN WITH THE WHITE HAIR\n\nIt was close on midnight when a man crossed the Place de la\nConcorde.",
    "In spite of the handsome fur coat which garbed his\nmeagre form there was something essentially weak and paltry\nabout him.",
    "A little man with a face like a rat.",
    "A man one would say who could\nnever play a conspicuous part or rise to prominence in any\nsphere.",
    "And yet in leaping to such a conclusion an onlooker\nwould\n\nhave been wrong.",
    "For\n\nthis\n\nman\n\nnegligible\n\nand\n\ninconspicuous as he seemed played a prominent part in the\ndestiny of the world.",
    "In an Empire where rats ruled he was the\nking of the rats.",
    "Even now an Embassy awaited his return.",
    "But he had business to\ndo first  business of which the Embassy was not officially\ncognizant.",
    "His face gleamed white and sharp in the moonlight.",
    "There was the least hint of a curve in the thin nose.",
    "His father had\nbeen a Polish Jew a journeyman tailor.",
    "It was business such as\nhis father would have loved that took him abroad tonight.",
    "He came to the Seine crossed it and entered one of the less\nreputable quarters of Paris.",
    "Here he stopped before a tall\n\n\fdilapidated house and made his way up to an apartment on the\nfourth floor.",
    "He had barely time to knock before the door was\nopened by a woman who had evidently been awaiting his arrival.",
    "She gave him no greeting but helped him off with his overcoat and\nthen led the way into the tawdrily furnished sittingroom.",
    "The electric light was shaded with dirty pink festoons and it\nsoftened but could not disguise the girls face with its mask of\ncrude paint.",
    "Could not disguise either the broad Mongolian cast\nof her countenance.",
    "There was no doubt of Olga Demiroffs profession nor of her\nnationality.",
    "All is well little one\n\nAll is well Boris Ivanovitch.",
    "He nodded murmuring I do not think I have been followed.",
    "But there was anxiety in his tone.",
    "He went to the window drawing\nthe curtains aside slightly and peering carefully out.",
    "He started\naway violently.",
    "There are two men  on the opposite pavement.",
    "It looks to me \nHe broke off and began gnawing at his nails  a habit he had when\nanxious.",
    "The Russian girl was shaking her head with a slow reassuring\naction.",
    "They were here before you came.",
    "All the same it looks to me as though they were watching this\nhouse.",
    "Possibly she admitted indifferently.",
    "But then \n\nWhat of it Even if they know  it will not be you they will follow\nfrom here.",
    "A thin cruel smile came to his lips.",
    "No he admitted that is true.",
    "He mused for a minute or two and then observed.",
    "This damned American  he can look after himself as well as\nanybody.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "He went again to the window.",
    "Tough customers he muttered with a chuckle.",
    "Known to the\npolice I fear.",
    "Well well I wish Brother Apache good hunting.",
    "Olga Demiroff shook her head.",
    "If the American is the kind of man they say he is it will take more\nthan a couple of cowardly apaches to get the better of him.",
    "She paused.",
    "I wonder \n\nWell\n\nNothing.",
    "Only twice this evening a man has passed along this\nstreet  a man with white hair.",
    "What of it\n\nThis.",
    "As he passed those two men he dropped his glove.",
    "One of\nthem picked it up and returned it to him.",
    "A threadbare device.",
    "You mean  that the whitehaired man is  their employer\n\nSomething of the kind.",
    "The Russian looked alarmed and uneasy.",
    "You are sure  the parcel is safe It has not been tampered with\nThere has been too much talk... much too much talk.",
    "He gnawed his nails again.",
    "Judge for yourself.",
    "She bent to the fireplace deftly removing the coals.",
    "Underneath\nfrom amongst the crumpled balls of newspaper she selected from\n\n\fthe very middle an oblong package wrapped round with grimy\nnewspaper and handed it to the man.",
    "Ingenious he said with a nod of approval.",
    "The apartment has been searched twice.",
    "The mattress on my bed\nwas ripped open.",
    "It is as I said he muttered.",
    "There has been too much talk.",
    "This\nhaggling over the price  it was a mistake.",
    "He had unwrapped the newspaper.",
    "Inside was a small brown\npaper parcel.",
    "This in turn he unwrapped verified the contents\nand quickly wrapped it up once more.",
    "As he did so an electric bell\nrang sharply.",
    "The American is punctual said Olga with a glance at the clock.",
    "She left the room.",
    "In a minute she returned ushering in a stranger\na big broadshouldered man whose transatlantic origin was\nevident.",
    "His keen glance went from one to the other.",
    "M. Krassnine he inquired politely.",
    "I am he said Boris.",
    "I must apologize for  for the\nunconventionality of this meetingplace.",
    "But secrecy is urgent.",
    "I  I\ncannot afford to be connected with this business in any way.",
    "Is that so said the American politely.",
    "I have your word have I not that no details of this transaction will\nbe made public That is one of the conditions of  sale.",
    "The American nodded.",
    "That has already been agreed upon he said indifferently.",
    "Now\nperhaps you will produce the goods.",
    "You have the money  in notes\n\nYes replied the other.",
    "He did not however make any attempt to produce it.",
    "After a\nmoments hesitation Krassnine gestured towards the small parcel\non the table.",
    "The American took it up and unrolled the wrapping paper.",
    "The\ncontents he took over to a small electric lamp and submitted them\nto a very thorough examination.",
    "Satisfied he drew from his pocket\na thick leather wallet and extracted from it a wad of notes.",
    "These\nhe handed to the Russian who counted them carefully.",
    "All right\n\nI thank you Monsieur.",
    "Everything is correct.",
    "Ah said the other.",
    "He slipped the brown paper parcel\nnegligently into his pocket.",
    "He bowed to Olga.",
    "Good evening\nMademoiselle.",
    "Good evening M. Krassnine.",
    "He went out shutting the door behind him.",
    "The eyes of the two in\nthe room met.",
    "The man passed his tongue over his dry lips.",
    "I wonder  will he ever get back to his hotel he muttered.",
    "By common accord they both turned to the window.",
    "They were\njust in time to see the American emerge into the street below.",
    "He turned to the left and marched along at a good pace without\nonce turning his head.",
    "Two shadows stole from a doorway and\nfollowed noiselessly.",
    "Pursuers and pursued vanished into the\nnight.",
    "Olga Demiroff spoke.",
    "He will get back safely she said.",
    "You need not fear  or hope whichever it is.",
    "Why do you think he will be safe asked Krassnine curiously.",
    "A man who has made as much money as he has could not\npossibly be a fool said Olga.",
    "And talking of money \n\nShe looked significantly at Krassnine.",
    "Eh\n\nMy share Boris Ivanovitch.",
    "With some reluctance Krassnine handed over two of the notes.",
    "She nodded her thanks with a complete lack of emotion and\ntucked them away in her stocking.",
    "That is good she remarked with satisfaction.",
    "He looked at her curiously.",
    "You have no regrets Olga Vassilovna\n\nRegrets For what\n\nFor what has been in your keeping.",
    "There are women  most\nwomen I believe who go mad over such things.",
    "She nodded reflectively.",
    "Yes you speak truth there.",
    "Most women have that madness.",
    "I have not.",
    "I wonder now  She broke off.",
    "Well asked the other curiously.",
    "The American will be safe with them  yes I am sure of that.",
    "But\nafterwards \n\nEh What are you thinking of\n\nHe will give them of course to some woman said Olga\nthoughtfully.",
    "I wonder what will happen then...\n\nShe shook herself impatiently and went over to the window.",
    "Suddenly she uttered an\ncompanion.",
    "exclamation\n\nand called to her\n\n\fSee he is going down the street now  the man I mean.",
    "They both gazed down together.",
    "A slim elegant figure was\nprogressing along at a leisurely pace.",
    "He wore an opera hat and a\ncloak.",
    "As he passed a street lamp the light illuminated a thatch of\nthick white hair.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nM. LE MARQUIS\n\nThe man with the white hair continued on his course unhurried\nand seemingly indifferent to his surroundings.",
    "He took a side\nturning to the right and another one to the left.",
    "Now and then he\nhummed a little air to himself.",
    "Suddenly he stopped dead and listened intently.",
    "He had heard a\ncertain sound.",
    "It might have been the bursting of a tyre or it might\nhave been  a shot.",
    "A curious smile played round his lips for a\nminute.",
    "Then he resumed his leisurely walk.",
    "On turning a corner he came upon a scene of some activity.",
    "A\nrepresentative of the law was making notes in a pocketbook and\none or two late passersby had collected on the spot.",
    "To one of\nthese the man with the white hair made a polite request for\ninformation.",
    "Something has been happening yes\n\nMais oui Monsieur.",
    "Two apaches set upon an elderly American\ngentleman.",
    "They did him no injury\n\nNo indeed.",
    "The man laughed.",
    "The American he had a revolver\nin his pocket and before they could attack him he fired shots so\nclosely round them that they took alarm and fled.",
    "The police as\nusual arrived too late.",
    "Ah said the inquirer.",
    "He displayed no emotion of any kind.",
    "Placidly and unconcernedly\nhe resumed his nocturnal strolling.",
    "Presently he crossed the Seine\nand came into the richer areas of the city.",
    "It was some twenty\nminutes later that he came to a stop before a certain house in a\nquiet but aristocratic thoroughfare.",
    "The shop for shop it was was a restrained and unpretentious\none.",
    "D. Papopolous dealer in antiques was so known to fame that\nhe needed no advertisement and indeed most of his business was\nnot done over a counter.",
    "M. Papopolous had a very handsome apartment of his own\noverlooking the Champs Elysees and it might reasonably be\nsupposed that he would have been found there and not at his\nplace of business at such an hour but the man with the white hair\nseemed confident of success as he pressed the obscurely placed\n\n\fbell having first given a quick glance up and down the deserted\nstreet.",
    "His confidence was not misplaced.",
    "The door opened and a man\nstood in the aperture.",
    "He wore gold rings in his ears and was of a\nswarthy cast of countenance.",
    "Good evening said the stranger.",
    "Your master is within\n\nThe master is here but he does not see chance visitors at this\ntime of night growled the other.",
    "I think he will see me.",
    "Tell him that his friend M. le Marquis is\nhere.",
    "The man opened the door a little wider and allowed the visitor to\nenter.",
    "The man who gave his name as M. le Marquis had shielded his\nface with his hand as he spoke.",
    "When the manservant returned\nwith the information that M. Papopolous would be pleased to\nreceive the visitor a further change had taken place in the\nstrangers appearance.",
    "The manservant must have been very\nunobservant or very well trained for he betrayed no surprise at\nthe small black satin mask which hid the others features.",
    "Leading the way to a door at the end of the hall he opened it and\nannounced in a respectful murmur M. le Marquis.",
    "The figure which rose to receive this strange guest was an\nimposing one.",
    "There was something venerable and patriarchal\nabout M. Papopolous.",
    "He had a high domed forehead and a\nbeautiful\n\nwhite\n\nbeard.",
    "His\n\nmanner\n\nhad\n\nin\n\nit\n\nsomething\n\necclesiastical and benign.",
    "My dear friend said M. Papopolous.",
    "He spoke in French and his\ntones were rich and unctuous.",
    "I must apologize said the visitor for the lateness of the hour.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Not at all said M. Papopolous  an interesting time of\nnight.",
    "You have had perhaps an interesting evening\n\nNot personally said M. Le Marquis.",
    "Not personally repeated M. Papopolous no no of course not.",
    "And there is news eh\n\nHe cast a sharp glance sideways at the other a glance that was\nnot ecclesiastical or benign in the least.",
    "There is no news.",
    "The attempt failed.",
    "I hardly expected anything\nelse.",
    "Quite so said M. Papopolous anything crude \n\nHe waved his hand to express his intense distaste for crudity in\nany form.",
    "There was indeed nothing crude about M. Papopolous\nnor about the goods he handled.",
    "He was well known in most\n\n\fEuropean courts and kings called him Demetrius in a friendly\nmanner.",
    "He had the reputation for the most exquisite discretion.",
    "That together with the nobility of his aspect had carried him\nthrough several very questionable transactions.",
    "The direct attack  said M. Papopolous.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "It\nanswers sometimes  but very seldom.",
    "The other shrugged his shoulders.",
    "It saves time he remarked and to fail costs nothing  or next to\nnothing.",
    "The other plan  will not fail.",
    "Ah said M. Papopolous looking at him keenly.",
    "The other nodded slowly.",
    "I have great confidence in your  er  reputation said the antique\ndealer.",
    "M. le Marquis smiled gently.",
    "I think I may say he murmured that your confidence will not be\nmisplaced.",
    "You have unique opportunities said the other with a note of\nenvy in his voice.",
    "I make them said M. le Marquis.",
    "He rose and took up the cloak which he had thrown carelessly on\nthe back of a chair.",
    "I will keep you informed M. Papopolous through the usual\nchannels but there must be no hitch in your arrangements.",
    "M. Papopolous was pained.",
    "There is never a hitch in my arrangements he complained.",
    "The other smiled and without any further word of adieu he left the\nroom closing the door behind him.",
    "M. Papopolous remained in thought for a moment stroking his\nvenerable white beard and then moved across to a second door\nwhich opened inwards.",
    "As he turned the handle a young woman\nwho only too clearly had been leaning against it with her ear to the\nkeyhole stumbled headlong into the room.",
    "M. Papopolous\ndisplayed neither surprise nor concern.",
    "It was evidently all quite\nnatural to him.",
    "Well Zia he asked.",
    "I did not hear him go explained Zia.",
    "She was a handsome young woman built on Junoesque lines with\ndark flashing eyes and such a general air of resemblance to M.\nPapopolous that it was easy to see they were father and daughter.",
    "It is annoying she continued vexedly that one cannot see\nthrough a keyhole and hear through it at the same time.",
    "It has often annoyed me said M. Papopolous with great\nsimplicity.",
    "So that is M. le Marquis said Zia slowly.",
    "Does he always wear a\nmask father\n\nAlways.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "It is the rubies I suppose asked Zia.",
    "Her father nodded.",
    "What do you think my little one he inquired with a hint of\namusement in his beady black eyes.",
    "Of M. le Marquis\n\nYes.",
    "I think said Zia slowly that it is a very rare thing to find a wellbred Englishman who speaks French as well as that.",
    "Ah said M. Papopolous so that is what you think.",
    "As usual he did not commit himself but he regarded Zia with\nbenign approval.",
    "I thought too said Zia that his head was an odd shape.",
    "Massive said her father  a trifle massive.",
    "But then that effect is\nalways created by a wig.",
    "They both looked at each other and smiled.",
    "Chapter 3\n\nHEART OF FIRE\n\nRufus Van Aldin passed through the revolving doors of the Savoy\nand walked to the reception desk.",
    "The desk clerk smiled a\nrespectful greeting.",
    "Pleased to see you back again Mr Van Aldin he said.",
    "The American millionaire nodded his head in a casual greeting.",
    "Everything all right he asked.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Major Knighton is upstairs in the suite now.",
    "Van Aldin nodded again.",
    "Any mail he vouchsafed.",
    "They have all been sent up Mr Van Aldin.",
    "Oh wait a minute.",
    "He dived into a pigeon hole and produced a letter.",
    "Just come this minute he explained.",
    "Rufus Van Aldin took the letter from him and as he saw the\nhandwriting a womans flowing hand his face was suddenly\ntransformed.",
    "The harsh contours of it softened and the hard line\nof his mouth relaxed.",
    "He looked a different man.",
    "He walked across\nto the lift with the letter in his hand and the smile still on his lips.",
    "In the drawingroom of his suite a young man was sitting at a desk\nnimbly sorting correspondence with the ease born of long\npractice.",
    "He sprang up as Van Aldin entered.",
    "Hallo Knighton\n\nGlad to see you back sir.",
    "Had a good time\n\nSo so said the millionaire unemotionally.",
    "Paris is rather a onehorse city nowadays.",
    "Still  I got what I went over for.",
    "He smiled to himself rather grimly.",
    "You usually do I believe said the secretary laughing.",
    "Thats so agreed the other.",
    "He spoke in a matteroffact manner as one stating a wellknown\nfact.",
    "Throwing off his heavy overcoat he advanced to the desk.",
    "Anything urgent\n\nI dont think so sir.",
    "Mostly the usual stuff.",
    "I have not quite\nfinished sorting it out.",
    "Van Aldin nodded briefly.",
    "He was a man who seldom expressed\neither blame or praise.",
    "His methods with those he employed were\nsimple he gave them a fair trial and dismissed promptly those\nwho\n\nwere\n\ninefficient.",
    "His\n\nselections\n\nof\n\npeople\n\nwere\n\nunconventional.",
    "Knighton for instance he had met casually at a Swiss resort two\nmonths previously.",
    "He had approved of the fellow looked up his\nwar record and found in it the explanation of the limp with which\nhe walked.",
    "Knighton had made no secret of the fact that he was\nlooking for a job and indeed diffidently asked the millionaire if he\nknew of any available post.",
    "Van Aldin remembered with a grim\nsmile of amusement the young mans complete astonishment\nwhen he had been offered the post of secretary to the great man\nhimself.",
    "But  but I have no experience of business he had stammered.",
    "That doesnt matter a cuss Van Aldin had replied.",
    "I have got\nthree secretaries already to attend to that kind of thing.",
    "But I am\nlikely to be in England for the next six months and I want an\n\n\fEnglishman who  well knows the ropes  and can attend to the\nsocial side of things for me.",
    "So far Van Aldin had found his judgment confirmed.",
    "Knighton had\nproved quick intelligent and resourceful and he had a distinct\ncharm of manner.",
    "The secretary indicated three or four letters placed by themselves\non the top of the desk.",
    "It might perhaps be as well sir if you glanced at these he\nsuggested.",
    "The top one is about the Colton agreement \n\nBut Rufus Van Aldin held up a protesting hand.",
    "I am not going to look at a darned thing tonight he declared.",
    "They can all wait till the morning.",
    "Except this one he added\nlooking down at the letter he held in his hand.",
    "And again that\nstrange transforming smile stole over his face.",
    "Richard Knighton smiled sympathetically.",
    "Mrs Kettering he murmured.",
    "She rang up yesterday and\ntoday.",
    "She seems very anxious to see you at once sir.",
    "Does she now\n\nThe smile faded from the millionaires face.",
    "He ripped open the\nenvelope which he held in his hand and took out the enclosed\nsheet.",
    "As he read it his face darkened his mouth set grimly in the\n\n\fline which Wall Street knew so well and his brows knit themselves\nominously.",
    "Knighton turned tactfully away and went on opening\nletters and sorting them.",
    "A muttered oath escaped the millionaire\nand his clenched fist hit the table sharply.",
    "Ill not stand for this he muttered to himself.",
    "Poor little girl its\na good thing she has her old father behind her.",
    "He walked up and down the room for some minutes his brows\ndrawn together in a scowl.",
    "Knighton still bent assiduously over the\ndesk.",
    "Suddenly Van Aldin came to an abrupt halt.",
    "He took up his\novercoat from the chair where he had thrown it.",
    "Are you going out again sir\n\nYes Im going round to see my daughter.",
    "If Coltons people ring up \n\nTell them to go to the devil said Van Aldin.",
    "Very well said the secretary unemotionally.",
    "Van Aldin had his overcoat on by now.",
    "Cramming his hat upon his\nhead he went towards the door.",
    "He paused with his hand upon\nthe handle.",
    "You are a good fellow Knighton he said.",
    "You dont worry me\nwhen I am rattled.",
    "Knighton smiled a little but made no reply.",
    "Ruth is my only child said Van Aldin and there is no one on this\nearth who knows quite what she means to me.",
    "A faint smile irradiated his face.",
    "He slipped his hand into his\npocket.",
    "Care to see something Knighton\n\nHe came back towards the secretary.",
    "From his pocket he drew out a parcel carelessly wrapped in\nbrown paper.",
    "He tossed off the wrapping and disclosed a big\nshabby red velvet case.",
    "In the centre of it were some twisted\ninitials surmounted by a crown.",
    "He snapped the case open and\nthe secretary drew in his breath sharply.",
    "Against the slightly dingy\nwhite of the interior the stones glowed like blood.",
    "My God sir said Knighton.",
    "Are they  are they real\n\nVan Aldin laughed a quiet little cackle of amusement.",
    "I dont wonder at your asking that.",
    "Amongst these rubies are the\nthree largest in the world.",
    "Katherine of Russia wore them\nKnighton.",
    "That centre one there is known as Heart of Fire.",
    "Its\nperfect  not a flaw in it.",
    "But the secretary murmured they must be worth a fortune.",
    "Four or five hundred thousand dollars said Van Aldin\nnonchalantly and that is apart from the historical interest.",
    "And you carry them about  like that loose in your pocket\n\nVan Aldin laughed amusedly.",
    "I guess so.",
    "You see they are my little present for Ruthie.",
    "The secretary smiled discreetly.",
    "I can understand now Mrs Ketterings anxiety over the\ntelephone he murmured.",
    "But Van Aldin shook his head.",
    "The hard\nlook returned to his face.",
    "You are wrong there he said.",
    "She doesnt know about these\nthey are my little surprise for her.",
    "He shut the case and began slowly to wrap it up again.",
    "Its a hard thing Knighton he said how little one can do for\nthose one loves.",
    "I can buy a good portion of the earth for Ruth if it\nwould be any use to her but it isnt.",
    "I can hang these things round\nher neck and give her a moment or twos pleasure maybe but \n\nHe shook his head.",
    "When a woman is not happy in her home \n\n\fHe left the sentence unfinished.",
    "The secretary nodded discreetly.",
    "He knew none better the reputation of the Hon Derek Kettering.",
    "Van Aldin sighed.",
    "Slipping the parcel back in his coat pocket he\nnodded to Knighton and left the room.",
    "Chapter 4\n\nIN CURZON STREET\n\nThe Hon Mrs Derek Kettering lived in Curzon Street.",
    "The butler\nwho opened the door recognized Rufus Van Aldin at once and\npermitted himself a discreet smile of greeting.",
    "He led the way\nupstairs to the big double drawingroom on the first floor.",
    "A woman who was sitting by the window started up with a cry.",
    "Why Dad if that isnt too good for anything Ive been\ntelephoning Major Knighton all day to try and get hold of you but\nhe couldnt say for sure when you were expected back.",
    "Ruth Kettering was twentyeight years of age.",
    "Without being\nbeautiful or in the real sense of the word even pretty she was\nstriking looking because of her colouring.",
    "Van Aldin had been\ncalled Carrots and Ginger in his time and Ruths hair was almost\npure auburn.",
    "With it went dark eyes and very black lashes  the\neffect somewhat enhanced by art.",
    "She was tall and slender and\nmoved well.",
    "At a careless glance it was the face of a Raphael\nMadonna.",
    "Only if one looked closely did one perceive the same\n\n\fline of jaw and chin as in Van Aldins face bespeaking the same\nhardness and determination.",
    "It suited the man but suited the\nwoman less well.",
    "From her childhood upward Ruth Van Aldin had\nbeen accustomed to having her own way and anyone who had\never stood up against her soon realized that Rufus Van Aldins\ndaughter never gave in.",
    "Knighton told me youd phoned him said Van Aldin.",
    "I only got\nback from Paris half an hour ago.",
    "Whats all this about Derek\n\nRuth Kettering flushed angrily.",
    "Its unspeakable.",
    "Its beyond all limits she cried.",
    "He  he\ndoesnt seem to listen to anything I say.",
    "There was bewilderment as well as anger in her voice.",
    "Hell listen to me said the millionaire grimly.",
    "Ruth went on.",
    "Ive hardly seen him for the last month.",
    "He goes about\neverywhere with that woman.",
    "With what woman\n\nMirelle.",
    "She dances at the Parthenon you know.",
    "Van Aldin nodded.",
    "I was down at Leconbury last week.",
    "I  I spoke to Lord Leconbury.",
    "He was awfully sweet to me sympathized entirely.",
    "He said hed\ngive Derek a good talking to.",
    "Ah said Van Aldin.",
    "What do you mean by Ah Dad\n\nJust what you think I mean Ruthie.",
    "Poor old Leconbury is a\nwashout.",
    "Of course he sympathized with you of course he tried\nto soothe you down.",
    "Having got his son and heir married to the\ndaughter of one of the richest men in the States he naturally\ndoesnt want to mess the thing up.",
    "But hes got one foot in the\ngrave already everyone knows that and anything he may say will\ncut darned little ice with Derek.",
    "Cant you do anything Dad urged Ruth after a minute or two.",
    "I might said the millionaire.",
    "He waited a second reflectively and\nthen went on.",
    "There are several things I might do but theres only one that will\nbe any real good.",
    "How much pluck have you got Ruthie\n\nShe stared at him.",
    "He nodded back at her.",
    "I mean just what I say.",
    "Have you got the grit to admit to all the\nworld that youve made a mistake Theres only one way out of\nthis mess Ruthie.",
    "Cut your losses and start afresh.",
    "You mean \n\nDivorce.",
    "Divorce\n\nVan Aldin smiled drily.",
    "You say that word Ruth as though youd never heard it before.",
    "And yet your friends are doing it all round you every day.",
    "Oh I know that.",
    "But \n\nShe stopped biting her lip.",
    "Her father nodded comprehendingly.",
    "I know Ruth.",
    "Youre like me you cant bear to let go.",
    "But Ive\nlearnt and youve got to learn that there are times when its the\nonly way.",
    "I might find ways of whistling Derek back to you but it\nwould all come to the same in the end.",
    "Hes no good Ruth hes\nrotten through and through.",
    "And mind you I blame myself for ever\nletting you marry him.",
    "But you were kind of set on having him and\nhe seemed in earnest about turning over a new leaf  and well Id\ncrossed you once honey...",
    "He did not look at her as he said the last words.",
    "Had he done so\nhe might have seen the swift colour that came up in her face.",
    "You did she said in a hard voice.",
    "I was too darned softhearted to do it a second time.",
    "I cant tell\nyou how I wish I had though.",
    "Youve led a poor kind of life for the\nlast few years Ruth.",
    "It has not been very  agreeable agreed Mrs Kettering.",
    "Thats why I say to you that this thing has got to stop He\nbrought his hand down with a bang on the table.",
    "You may have a\nhankering after the fellow still.",
    "Cut it out.",
    "Face facts.",
    "Derek\nKettering married you for your money.",
    "Thats all there is to it.",
    "Get\nrid of him Ruth.",
    "Ruth Kettering looked down at the ground for some moments\nthen she said without raising her head\n\nSupposing he doesnt consent\n\nVan Aldin looked at her in astonishment.",
    "He wont have a say in the matter.",
    "She flushed and bit her lip.",
    "No  no  of course not.",
    "I only meant \n\nShe stopped.",
    "Her father eyed her keenly.",
    "What did you mean\n\n\fI meant  She paused choosing her words carefully.",
    "He maynt\ntake it lying down.",
    "The millionaires chin shot out grimly.",
    "You mean hell fight the case Let him But as a matter of fact\nyoure wrong.",
    "He wont fight.",
    "Any solicitor he consults will tell him\nhe hasnt a leg to stand upon.",
    "You dont think  she hesitated  I mean  out of sheer spite\nagainst me  he might try to make it awkward\n\nHer father looked at her in some astonishment.",
    "Fight the case you mean\n\nHe shook his head.",
    "Very unlikely.",
    "You see he would have to have something to go\nupon.",
    "Mrs Kettering did not answer.",
    "Van Aldin looked at her sharply.",
    "Come Ruth out with it.",
    "Theres something troubling you  what is\nit\n\nNothing nothing at all.",
    "But her voice was unconvincing.",
    "You are dreading the publicity eh Is that it You leave it to me.",
    "Ill put the whole thing through so smoothly that there will be no\nfuss at all.",
    "Very well Dad if you really think its the best thing to be done.",

    "The word came with no uncertain emphasis.",
    "Van Aldin seemed\nsatisfied.",
    "He patted his daughter on the shoulder.",
    "It will be all right little girl.",
    "Dont you worry any.",
    "Now lets forget\nall about this.",
    "I have brought you a present from Paris.",
    "For me Something very nice\n\nI hope youll think so said Van Aldin smiling.",
    "He took the parcel from his coat pocket and handed it to her.",
    "She\nunwrapped it eagerly and snapped open the case.",
    "A longdrawn\nOh came from her lips.",
    "Ruth Kettering loved jewels  always had\ndone so.",
    "Dad how  how wonderful\n\nRather in a class by themselves arent they said the\nmillionaire with satisfaction.",
    "You like them eh\n\n\fLike them Dad theyre unique.",
    "How did you get hold of them\n\nVan Aldin smiled.",
    "Ah thats my secret.",
    "They had to be bought privately of course.",
    "They are rather well known.",
    "See that big stone in the middle You\nhave heard of it maybe thats the historic Heart of Fire.",
    "Heart of Fire repeated Mrs Kettering.",
    "She had taken the stones from the case and was holding them\nagainst her breast.",
    "The millionaire watched her.",
    "He was thinking of the series of\nwomen who had worn the jewels.",
    "The heartaches the despairs\nthe jealousies.",
    "Heart of Fire like all famous stones had left\nbehind it a trail of tragedy and violence.",
    "Held in Ruth Ketterings\nassured hand it seemed to lose its potency of evil.",
    "With her cool\nequable poise this woman of the western world seemed a\nnegation to tragedy or heartburnings.",
    "Ruth returned the stones to\ntheir case then jumping up she flung her arms round her fathers\nneck.",
    "Thank you thank you thank you Dad They are wonderful You\ndo give me the most marvelous presents always.",

    "You will stay to dinner wont you father\n\n\fI dont think so.",
    "You were going out werent you\n\nYes but I can easily put that off.",
    "Nothing very exciting.",
    "No said Van Aldin.",
    "Keep your engagement.",
    "I have got a good\ndeal to attend to.",
    "See you tomorrow my dear.",
    "Perhaps if I phone\nyou we can meet at Galbraiths\n\nMessrs. Galbraith Galbraith Cuthbertson  Galbraith were Van\nAldins London solicitors.",
    "Very well Dad.",
    "She hesitated.",
    "I suppose it  this  wont keep\nme from going to the Riviera\n\nWhen are you off\n\nOn the fourteenth.",
    "Oh that will be all right.",
    "These things take a long time to mature.",
    "By the way Ruth I shouldnt take those rubies abroad if I were\nyou.",
    "Leave them at the bank.",
    "Mrs Kettering nodded.",
    "We dont want to have you robbed and murdered for the sake of\nHeart of Fire said the millionaire jocosely.",
    "And yet you carried it about in your pocket loose retorted his\ndaughter smiling.",
    "Yes \n\nSomething some hesitation caught her attention.",
    "What is it Dad\n\nNothing.",
    "He smiled.",
    "Thinking of a little adventure of mine in\nParis.",
    "An adventure\n\nYes the night I bought these things.",
    "He made a gesture towards the jewel case.",
    "Oh do tell me.",
    "Nothing to tell Ruthie.",
    "Some apache fellows got a bit fresh and I\nshot at them and they got off.",
    "Thats all.",
    "She looked at him with some pride.",
    "Youre a tough proposition Dad.",
    "You bet I am Ruthie.",
    "He kissed her affectionately and departed.",
    "On arriving back at the\nSavoy he gave a curt order to Knighton.",
    "Get hold of a man called Goby youll find his address in my\nprivate book.",
    "Hes to be here tomorrow morning at halfpast nine.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "I also want to see Mr Kettering.",
    "Run him to earth for me if you\ncan.",
    "Try his Club  at any rate get hold of him somehow and\narrange for me to see him here tomorrow morning.",
    "Better make it\nlatish about twelve.",
    "His sort arent early risers.",
    "The secretary nodded in comprehension of these instructions.",
    "Van Aldin gave himself into the hands of his valet.",
    "His bath was\nprepared and as he lay luxuriating in the hot water his mind went\nback over the conversation with his daughter.",
    "On the whole he\nwas well satisfied.",
    "His keen mind had long since accepted the fact\nthat divorce was the only possible way out.",
    "Ruth had agreed to the\nproposed solution with more readiness than he had hoped for.",
    "Yet in spite of her acquiescence he was left with a vague sense\nof uneasiness.",
    "Something about her manner he felt had not been\nquite natural.",
    "He frowned to himself.",
    "Maybe Im fanciful he muttered and yet  I bet theres\nsomething she has not told me.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nA USEFUL GENTLEMAN\n\n\fRufus Van Aldin had just finished the sparse breakfast of coffee\nand dry toast which was all he ever allowed himself when\nKnighton entered the room.",
    "Mr Goby is below sir waiting to see you.",
    "The millionaire glanced at the clock.",
    "It was just halfpast nine.",
    "All right he said curtly.",
    "He can come up.",
    "A minute or two later Mr Goby entered the room.",
    "He was a small\nelderly man shabbily dressed with eyes that looked carefully all\nround the room and never at the person he was addressing.",
    "Good morning Goby said the millionaire.",
    "Take a chair.",
    "Thank you Mr Van Aldin.",
    "Mr Goby sat down with his hands on his knees and gazed\nearnestly at the radiator.",
    "I have got a job for you.",
    "Yes Mr Van Aldin\n\nMy daughter is married to the Hon Derek Kettering as you may\nperhaps know.",
    "Mr Goby transferred his gaze from the radiator to the lefthand\ndrawer of the desk and permitted a deprecating smile to pass\n\n\fover his face.",
    "Mr Goby knew a great many things but he always\nhated to admit the fact.",
    "By my advice she is about to file a petition for divorce.",
    "That of\ncourse is a solicitors business.",
    "But for private reasons I want\nthe fullest and most complete information.",
    "Mr Goby looked at the cornice and murmured\n\nAbout Mr Kettering\n\nAbout Mr Kettering.",
    "Very good sir.",
    "Mr Goby rose to his feet.",
    "When will you have it ready for me\n\nIn a hurry sir\n\nIm always in a hurry said the millionaire.",
    "Mr Goby smiled understandingly at the wall.",
    "Two oclock this\nafternoon sir\n\nExcellent approved the other.",
    "Good morning Goby.",
    "Good morning Mr Van Aldin.",
    "Thats a very useful man said the millionaire as Goby went out\nand his secretary came in.",
    "In his own line hes a specialist.",
    "What is his line\n\nInformation.",
    "Give him twentyfour hours and he would lay the\nprivate life of the Archbishop of Canterbury bare for you.",
    "A useful sort of chap said Knighton with a smile.",
    "He has been useful to me once or twice said Van Aldin.",
    "Now\nthen Knighton Im ready for work.",
    "The next few hours saw a vast quantity of business rapidly\ntransacted.",
    "It was halfpast twelve when the telephone bell rang\nand Mr Van Aldin was informed that Mr Kettering had called.",
    "Knighton looked at Van Aldin and interpreted his brief nod.",
    "Ask Mr Kettering to come up please.",
    "The secretary gathered up his papers and departed.",
    "He and the\nvisitor passed each other in the doorway and Derek Kettering\nstood aside to let the other go out.",
    "Then he came in shutting the\ndoor behind him.",
    "Good morning sir.",
    "You are very anxious to see me I hear.",
    "The lazy voice with its slightly ironic inflection roused memories in\nVan Aldin.",
    "There was charm in it  there had always been charm in it.",
    "He\nlooked piercingly at his soninlaw.",
    "Derek Kettering was thirtyfour lean of build with a dark narrow face which had even now\nsomething indescribabiy boyish in it.",
    "Come in said Van Aldin curtly.",
    "Sit down.",
    "Kettering flung himself lightly into an armchair.",
    "He looked at his\nfatherinlaw with a kind of tolerant amusement.",
    "Not seen you for a long time sir he remarked pleasantly.",
    "About two years I should say.",
    "Seen Ruth yet\n\nI saw her last night said Van Aldin.",
    "Looking very fit isnt she said the other lightly.",
    "I didnt know you had had much opportunity of judging said Van\nAldin drily.",
    "Derek Kettering raised his eyebrows.",
    "Oh we sometimes meet at the same night club you know he\nsaid airily.",
    "I am not going to beat about the bush Van Aldin said curtly.",
    "I\nhave advised Ruth to file a petition for divorce.",
    "Derek Kettering seemed unmoved.",
    "How drastic he murmured.",
    "Do you mind if I smoke sir\n\nHe lit a cigarette and puffed out a cloud of smoke as he added\nnonchalantly\n\nAnd what did Ruth say\n\nRuth proposes to take my advice said her father.",
    "Does she really\n\nIs that all you have got to say demanded Van Aldin sharply.",
    "Kettering flicked his ash into the grate.",
    "I think you know he said with a detached air that shes\nmaking a great mistake.",
    "From your point of view she doubtless is said Van Aldin grimly.",
    "Oh come now said the other dont lets be personal.",
    "I really\nwasnt thinking of myself at the moment.",
    "I was thinking of Ruth.",
    "You know my poor old Governor really cant last much longer all\nthe doctors say so.",
    "Ruth had better give it a couple more years\nthen I shall be Lord Leconbury and she can be chatelaine of\nLeconbury which is what she married me for.",
    "I wont have any of your darned impudence roared Van Aldin.",
    "Derek Kettering smiled at him quite unmoved.",
    "I agree with you.",
    "Its an obsolete idea he said.",
    "Theres nothing\nin a title nowadays.",
    "Still Leconbury is a very fine old place and\nafter all we are one of the oldest families in England.",
    "It will be\nvery annoying for Ruth if she divorces me to find me marrying\nagain and some other woman queening it at Leconbury instead of\nher.",
    "I am serious young man said Van Aldin.",
    "Oh so am I said Kettering.",
    "I am in very low water financially it\nwill put me in a nasty hole if Ruth divorces me and after all if she\nhas stood it for ten years why not stand it a little longer I give\nyou my word of honour that the old man cant possibly last out\nanother eighteen months and as I said before its a pity Ruth\nshouldnt get what she married me for.",
    "You suggest that my daughter married you for your title and\nposition\n\nDerek Kettering laughed a laugh that was not all amusement.",
    "You dont think it was a question of a love match he asked.",
    "I know said Van Aldin slowly that you spoke very differently in\nParis ten years ago.",
    "Did I Perhaps I did.",
    "Ruth was very beautiful you know  rather\nlike an angel or a saint or something that had stepped down from\na niche in a church.",
    "I had fine ideas I remember of turning over a\n\n\fnew leaf of settling down and living up to the highest traditions of\nEnglish homelife with a beautiful wife who loved me.",
    "He laughed again rather more discordantly.",
    "But you dont believe that I suppose he said.",
    "I have no doubt at all that you married Ruth for her money said\nVan Aldin unemotionally.",
    "And that she married me for love asked the other ironically.",
    "Certainly said Van Aldin.",
    "Derek Kettering stared at him for a minute or two then he nodded\nreflectively.",
    "I see you believe that he said.",
    "So did I at the time.",
    "I can assure\nyou my dear fatherinlaw I was very soon undeceived.",
    "I dont know what you are getting at said Van Aldin and I dont\ncare.",
    "You have treated Ruth darned badly.",
    "Oh I have agreed Kettering lightly but shes tough you know.",
    "Shes your daughter.",
    "Underneath the pinkandwhite softness of\nher shes as hard as granite.",
    "You have always been known as a\nhard man so I have been told but Ruth is harder than you are.",
    "You at any rate love one person better than yourself.",
    "Ruth never\nhas and never will.",
    "That is enough said Van Aldin.",
    "I asked you here so that I could\ntell you fair and square what I meant to do.",
    "My girl has got to have\nsome happiness and remember this I am behind her.",
    "Derek Kettering got up and stood by the mantelpiece.",
    "He tossed\naway his cigarette.",
    "When he spoke his voice was very quiet.",
    "What exactly do you mean by that I wonder he said.",
    "I mean said Van Aldin that you had better not try to defend the\ncase.",
    "Oh said Kettering.",
    "Is that a threat\n\nYou can take it any way you please said Van Aldin.",
    "Kettering drew a chair up to the table.",
    "He sat down fronting the\nmillionaire.",
    "And supposing he said softly that just for arguments sake I\ndid defend the case\n\nVan Aldin shrugged his shoulders.",
    "You have not got a leg to stand upon you young fool.",
    "Ask your\nsolicitors they will soon tell you.",
    "Your conduct has been\nnotorious the talk of London.",
    "Ruth has been kicking up a row about Mirelle I suppose.",
    "Very\nfoolish of her.",
    "I dont interfere with her friends.",
    "What do you mean said Van Aldin sharply.",
    "Derek Kettering laughed.",
    "I see you dont know everything sir he said.",
    "You are perhaps\nnaturally prejudiced.",
    "He took up his hat and stick and moved towards the door.",
    "Giving advice is not much in my line.",
    "He delivered his final\nthrust.",
    "But in this case I should advise most strongly perfect\nfrankness between father and daughter.",
    "He passed quickly out of the room and shut the door behind him\njust as the millionaire sprang up.",
    "Now what the hell did he mean by that said Van Aldin as he\nsank back into his chair again.",
    "All his uneasiness returned in full force.",
    "There was something here that he had not yet got to the bottom of.",
    "The telephone was by his elbow he seized it and asked for the\nnumber of his daughters house.",
    "Hallo Hallo Is that Mayfair 81907 Mrs Kettering in Oh shes\nout is she Yes out to lunch.",
    "What time will she be in You dont\nknow Oh very good no theres no message.",
    "He slammed the receiver down again angrily.",
    "At two oclock he was pacing the floor of his room waiting\nexpectantly for Goby.",
    "The latter was ushered in at ten minutes past two.",
    "Well barked the millionaire sharply.",
    "But the little Mr Goby was not to be hurried.",
    "He sat down at the table produced a very shabby pocketbook\nand proceeded to read from it in a monotonous voice.",
    "The\nmillionaire listened attentively with an increasing satisfaction.",
    "Goby came to a full stop and looked attentively at the\nwastepaperbasket.",
    "Um said Van Aldin.",
    "That seems pretty definite.",
    "The case will go\nthrough like winking.",
    "The hotel evidence is all right I suppose\n\nCast iron said Mr Goby and looked malevolently at a gilt\narmchair.",
    "And financially hes in very low water.",
    "Hes trying to raise a loan\nnow you say Has already raised practically all he can upon his\nexpectations from his father.",
    "Once the news of the divorce gets\nabout he wont be able to raise another cent and not only that\nhis obligations can be bought up and pressure can be put upon\nhim from that quarter.",
    "We have got him Goby we have got him in\na cleft stick.",
    "He hit the table a bang with his fist.",
    "His face was grim and\ntriumphant.",
    "The information said Mr Goby in a thin voice seems\nsatisfactory.",
    "I have got to go round to Curzon Street now said the millionaire.",
    "I am much obliged to you Goby.",
    "You are the goods all right.",
    "A pale smile of gratification showed itself on the little mans face.",
    "Thank you Mr Van Aldin he said I try to do my best.",
    "Van Aldin did not go direct to Curzon Street.",
    "He went first to the\nCity where he had two interviews which added to his satisfaction.",
    "From there he took the tube to Down Street.",
    "As he was walking\nalong Curzon Street a figure came out of No.",
    "160 and turned up\nthe street towards him so that they passed each other on the\npavement.",
    "For a moment the millionaire had fancied it might be\nDerek Kettering himself the height and build were not unlike.",
    "But\nas they came face to face he saw that the man was a stranger to\nhim.",
    "At least  no not a stranger his face awoke some call of\nrecognition in the millionaires mind and it was associated\ndefinitely with something unpleasant.",
    "He cudgelled his brains in vain but the thing eluded him.",
    "He went\non shaking his head irritably.",
    "He hated to be baffled.",
    "Ruth Kettering was clearly expecting him.",
    "She ran to him and\nkissed him when he entered.",
    "Well Dad how are things going\n\nVery well said Van Aldin but I have got a word or two to say to\nyou Ruth.",
    "Almost insensibly he felt the change in her something shrewd and\nwatchful replaced the impulsiveness of her greeting.",
    "She sat\ndown in a big armchair.",
    "Well Dad she asked.",
    "What is it\n\nI saw your husband this morning said Van Aldin.",
    "You saw Derek\n\nI did.",
    "He said a lot of things most of which were darned cheek.",
    "Just as he was leaving he said something that I didnt understand.",
    "He advised me to be sure that there was perfect frankness\nbetween father and daughter.",
    "What did he mean by that Ruthie\n\nMrs Kettering moved a little in her chair.",
    "I  I dont know Dad.",
    "How should I\n\nOf course you know said Van Aldin.",
    "He said something else\nabout his having his friends and not interfering with yours.",
    "What\ndid he mean by that\n\n\fI dont know said Ruth Kettering again.",
    "Van Aldin sat down.",
    "His mouth set itself in a grim line.",
    "See here Ruth.",
    "I am not going into this with my eyes closed.",
    "I am\nnot at all sure that that husband of yours doesnt mean to make\ntrouble.",
    "Now he cant do it I am sure of that.",
    "I have got the means\nto silence him to shut his mouth for good and all but I have got to\nknow if theres any need to use those means.",
    "What did he mean by\nyour having your own friends\n\nMrs Kettering shrugged her shoulders.",
    "I have got lots of friends she said uncertainly.",
    "I dont know\nwhat he meant I am sure.",
    "You do said Van Aldin.",
    "He was speaking now as he might have spoken to a business\nadversary.",
    "I will put it plainer.",
    "Who is the man\n\nWhat man\n\nThe man.",
    "Thats what Derek was driving at.",
    "Some special man\nwho is a friend of yours.",
    "You neednt worry honey I know there is\nnothing in it but we have got to look at everything as it might\nappear to the Court.",
    "They can twist these things about a good\n\n\fdeal you know.",
    "I want to know who the man is and just how\nfriendly you have been with him.",
    "Ruth didnt answer.",
    "Her hands were kneading themselves\ntogether in intense nervous absorption.",
    "Come honey said Van Aldin in a softer voice.",
    "Dont be afraid of\nyour old Dad.",
    "I was not too harsh was I even that time in Paris By gosh\n\nHe stopped thunderstruck.",
    "Thats who it was he murmured to himself.",
    "I thought I knew his\nface.",
    "What are you talking about Dad I dont understand.",
    "The millionaire strode across to her and took her firmly by the\nwrist.",
    "See here Ruth have you been seeing that fellow again\n\nWhat fellow\n\nThe one we had all that fuss about years ago.",
    "You know who I\nmean well enough.",
    "You mean  she hesitated  you mean the Comte de la Roche\n\n\fComte de la Roche snorted Van Aldin.",
    "I told you at the time\nthat the man was no better than a swindler.",
    "You had entangled\nyourself with him then very deeply but I got you out of his\nclutches.",
    "Yes you did said Ruth bitterly.",
    "And I married Derek Kettering.",
    "You wanted to said the millionaire sharply.",
    "She shrugged her shoulders.",
    "And now said Van Aldin slowly you have been seeing him\nagain  after all I told you.",
    "He has been in the house today.",
    "I met\nhim outside and couldnt place him for the moment.",
    "Ruth Kettering had recovered her composure.",
    "I want to tell you one thing Dad you are wrong about Armand the Comte de la Roche I mean.",
    "Oh I know there were several\nregrettable incidents in his youth  he has told me about them but\n well he has cared for me always.",
    "It broke his heart when you\nparted us in Paris and now \n\nShe was interrupted by the snort of indignation her father gave.",
    "So you fell for that stuff did you You a daughter of mine My\nGod\n\nHe threw up his hands.",
    "That women can be such darned fools he murmured.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nMIRELLE\n\nDerek Kettering emerged from Van Aldins suite so precipitantly\nthat he collided with a lady passing across the corridor.",
    "He\napologised and she accepted his apologies with a smiling\nreassurance and passed on leaving him with a pleasant\nimpression of a soothing personality and rather fine grey eyes.",
    "For all his nonchalance his interview with his fatherinlaw had\nshaken him more than he cared to show.",
    "He had a solitary lunch\nand after it frowning to himself a little he went round to the\nsumptuous flat that housed the lady known as Mirelle.",
    "A trim\nFrenchwoman received him with smiles.",
    "But enter then Monsieur.",
    "Madame reposes herself.",
    "He was ushered into the long room with its eastern setting which\nhe knew so well.",
    "Mirelle was lying on the divan supported by an\nincredible amount of cushions all in varying shades of amber to\nharmonise with the yellow ochre of her complexion.",
    "The dancer\nwas a beautifully made woman and if her face beneath its mask\nof yellow was in truth somewhat haggard it had a bizarre charm\nof its own and her orange lips smiled invitingly at Derek Kettering.",
    "He kissed her and flung himself into a chair.",
    "What have you been doing with yourself Just got up I suppose\nThe orange mouth widened into a long smile.",
    "No said the dancer.",
    "I have been at work.",
    "She flung out a long pale hand towards the piano which was\nlittered with untidy music scores.",
    "Ambrose has been here.",
    "He has been playing me the new Opera.",
    "Kettering nodded without paying much attention.",
    "He was\nprofoundly uninterested in Claud Ambrose and the latters\noperatic setting of Ibsens Peer Gynt.",
    "So was Mirelle for that\nmatter regarding it merely as a unique opportunity for her own\npresentation as Anitra.",
    "It is a marvellous dance she murmured.",
    "I shall put all the\npassion of the desert into it.",
    "I shall dance hung over with jewels ah and by the way mon ami there is a pearl that I saw yesterday\nin Bond Street  a black pearl.",
    "She paused looking at him invitingly.",
    "My dear girl said Kettering its no use talking of black pearls to\nme.",
    "At the present minute as far as I am concerned the fat is in\nthe fire.",
    "She was quick to respond to his tone.",
    "She sat up her big black\neyes widening.",
    "What did you say Dereek What has happened\n\n\fMy esteemed fatherinlaw said Kettering is preparing to go\noff the deepend.",
    "Eh\n\nIn other words he wants Ruth to divorce me.",
    "How stupid said Mirelle.",
    "Why should she want to divorce you\n\nDerek Kettering grinned.",
    "Mainly because of you cherie he said.",
    "Mirelle shrugged her shoulders.",
    "That is foolish she observed in a matteroffact voice.",
    "Very foolish agreed Derek.",
    "What are you going to do about it demanded Mirelle.",
    "My dear girl what can I do On the one side the man with\nunlimited money on the other side the man with unlimited debts.",
    "There is no question as to who will come out on top.",
    "They are extraordinary these Americans commented Mirelle.",
    "It is not as though your wife were fond of you.",
    "Well said Derek what are we going to do about it\n\n\fShe looked at him inquiringly.",
    "He came over and took both her\nhands in his.",
    "Are you going to stick to me\n\nWhat do you mean After \n\nYes said Kettering.",
    "After when the creditors come down like\nwolves on the fold.",
    "I am damned fond of you Mirelle are you going\nto let me down\n\nShe pulled her hands away from him.",
    "You know I adore you Dereek.",
    "He caught the note of evasion in her voice.",
    "So thats that is it The rats will leave the sinking ship.",
    "Ah Dereek\n\nOut with it he said violently.",
    "You will fling me over is that it\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.",
    "I am fond of you mon ami  indeed I am fond of you.",
    "You are very\ncharming  un beau gar\u00e7on but ce nest pas pratique.",
    "You are a rich mans luxury eh Is that it\n\n\fIf you like to put it that way.",
    "She leaned back on the cushions her head flung back.",
    "All the same I am fond of you Dereek.",
    "He went over to the window and stood there some time looking\nout with his back to her.",
    "Presently the dancer raised herself on\nher elbow and stared at him curiously.",
    "What are you thinking of mon ami\n\nHe grinned at her over his shoulder a curious grin that made her\nvaguely uneasy.",
    "As it happened I was thinking of a woman my dear.",
    "A woman eh\n\nMirelle pounced on something that she could understand.",
    "You are thinking of some other woman is that it\n\nOh you neednt worry it is purely a fancy portrait.",
    "Portrait of a\nlady with grey eyes.",
    "Mirelle said sharply When did you meet her\n\nDerek Kettering laughed and his laughter had a mocking ironical\nsound.",
    "I ran into the lady in the corridor of the Savoy Hotel.",
    "Well what did she say\n\nAs far as I can remember I said I beg your pardon and she\nsaid It doesnt matter or words to that effect.",
    "And then persisted the dancer.",
    "Kettering shrugged his shoulders.",
    "And then  nothing.",
    "That was the end of the incident.",
    "I dont understand a word of what you are talking about\ndeclared the dancer.",
    "Portrait of a lady with grey eyes murmured Derek reflectively.",
    "Just as well I am never likely to meet her again.",
    "Why\n\nShe might bring me bad luck.",
    "Women do.",
    "Mirelle slipped quickly from her couch and came across to him\nlaying one long snakelike arm round his neck.",
    "You are foolish Dereek she murmured.",
    "You are very foolish.",
    "You are beau gar\u00e7on and I adore you but I am not made to be\n\n\fpoor  no decidedly I am not made to be poor.",
    "Now listen to me\neverything is very simple.",
    "You must make it up with your wife.",
    "I am afraid thats not going to be actually in the sphere of\npractical politics said Derek drily.",
    "How do you say I do not understand.",
    "Van Aldin my dear is not taking any.",
    "He is the kind of man who\nmakes up his mind and sticks to it.",
    "I have heard of him nodded the dancer.",
    "He is very rich is he\nnot Almost the richest man in America.",
    "A few days ago in Paris\nhe bought the most wonderful ruby in the world  Heart of Fire it\nis called.",
    "Kettering did not answer.",
    "The dancer went on musingly\n\nIt is a wonderful stone  a stone that should belong to a woman\nlike me.",
    "I love jewels Dereek they say something to me.",
    "Ah to\nwear a ruby like Heart of Fire.",
    "She gave a little sigh and then became practical once more.",
    "You dont understand these things Dereek you are only a man.",
    "Van Aldin will give these rubies to his daughter I suppose.",
    "Is she\nhis only child\n\nYes.",
    "Then when he dies she will inherit all his money.",
    "She will be a\nrich woman.",
    "She is a rich woman already said Kettering drily.",
    "He settled a\ncouple of millions on her at her marriage.",
    "A couple of millions But that is immense.",
    "And if she died\nsuddenly eh That would all come to you\n\nAs things stand at present said Kettering slowly it would.",
    "As\nfar as I know she has not made a will.",
    "Mon Dieu said the dancer.",
    "If she were to die what a solution\nthat would be.",
    "There was a moments pause and then Derek Kettering laughed\noutright.",
    "I like your simple practical mind Mirelle but I am afraid what\nyou desire wont come to pass.",
    "My wife is an extremely healthy\nperson.",
    "Eh bien said Mirelle there are accidents.",
    "He looked at her sharply but did not answer.",
    "She went on.",
    "But you are right mon ami we must not dwell on possibilities.",
    "See now my little Dereek there must be no more talk of this\ndivorce.",
    "Your wife must give up the idea.",
    "And if she wont\n\nThe dancers eyes widened to slits.",
    "I think she will my friend.",
    "She is one of those who would not like\nthe publicity.",
    "There are one or two pretty stories that she would\nnot like her friends to read in the newspapers.",
    "What do you mean asked Kettering sharply.",
    "Mirelle laughed her head thrown back.",
    "Parbleu I mean the gentleman who calls himself the Comte de la\nRoche.",
    "I know all about him.",
    "I am Parisienne you remember.",
    "He\nwas her lover before she married you was he not\n\nKettering took her sharply by the shoulders.",
    "That is a damned lie he said and please remember that after\nall you are speaking of my wife.",
    "Mirelle was a little sobered.",
    "You are extraordinary you English she complained.",
    "All the\nsame I dare say that you may be right.",
    "The Americans are so\ncold are they not But you will permit me to say mon ami that\n\n\fshe was in love with him before she married you and her father\nstepped in and sent the Comte about his business.",
    "And the little\nMademoiselle she wept many tears But she obeyed.",
    "Still you\nmust know as well as I do Dereek that it is a very different story\nnow.",
    "She sees him nearly every day and on the fourteenth she\ngoes to Paris to meet him.",
    "How do you know all this demanded Kettering.",
    "Me I have friends in Paris my dear Dereek who know the Comte\nintimately.",
    "It is all arranged.",
    "She is going to the Riviera so she\nsays but in reality the Comte meets her in Paris and  who knows\nYes yes you can take my word for it it is all arranged.",
    "Derek Kettering stood motionless.",
    "You see purred the dancer if you are clever you have her in\nthe hollow of your hand.",
    "You can make things very awkward for\nher.",
    "Oh for Gods sake be quiet cried Kettering.",
    "Shut your cursed\nmouth\n\nMirelle flung herself down again on the divan with a laugh.",
    "Kettering caught up his hat and coat and left the flat banging the\ndoor violently.",
    "And still the dancer sat on the divan and laughed\nsoftly to herself.",
    "She was not displeased with her work.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nLETTERS\n\nMrs Samuel Harfield presents her compliments to Miss Katherine\nGrey and wishes to point out that under the circumstances Miss\nGrey may not be aware \nMrs Harfield having written so far fluently came to a dead stop\nheld up by what has proved an insuperable difficulty to many other\npeople  namely the difficulty of expressing oneself fluently in the\nthird person.",
    "After a minute or two of hesitation Mrs Harfield tore up the sheet\nof notepaper and started afresh.",
    "Dear Miss Grey\nWhilst fully appreciating the adequate way you discharged your\nduties to my Cousin Emma whose recent death has indeed been a\nsevere blow to us all I cannot but feel \nAgain Mrs Harfield came to a stop.",
    "Once more the letter was\nconsigned to the wastepaperbasket.",
    "It was not until four false starts had been made that Mrs Harfield\nat last produced an epistle that satisfied her.",
    "It was duly sealed\nand stamped and addressed to Miss Katherine Grey Little\nCrampton St Mary Mead Kent and it lay beside that ladys plate\non the following morning at breakfasttime in company with a\nmore important looking communication in a long blue envelope.",
    "Katherine Grey opened Mrs Harfields letter first.",
    "The finished\nproduction ran as follows\nDear Miss Grey\nMy husband and I wish to express our thanks to you for your\nservices to my poor cousin Emma.",
    "Her death has been a great\nblow to us though we were of course aware that her mind has\nbeen failing for some time past.",
    "I understand that her latter\ntestamentary dispositions have been of a most peculiar character\nand they would not hold good of course in any court of law.",
    "I\nhave no doubt that with your usual good sense you have already\nrealized this fact.",
    "If these matters can be arranged privately it is\nalways so much better my husband says.",
    "We shall be pleased to\nrecommend you most highly for a similar post and hope that you\nwill also accept a small present.",
    "Believe me dear Miss Grey\nyours cordially\nMary Anne Harfield.",
    "Katherine Grey read the letter through smiled a little and read it\na second time.",
    "Her face as she laid the letter down after the\nsecond reading was distinctly amused.",
    "Then she took up the\nsecond letter.",
    "After one brief perusal she laid it down and stared\nvery straight in front of her.",
    "This time she did not smile.",
    "Indeed it\nwould have been hard for anyone watching her to guess what\nemotions lay behind that quiet reflective gaze.",
    "Katherine Grey was thirtythree.",
    "She came of good family but her\nfather had lost all his money and Katherine had had to work for\n\n\fher living from an early age.",
    "She had been just twentythree when\nshe had come to old Mrs Harfield as companion.",
    "It was generally recognized that old Mrs Harfield was difficult.",
    "Companions came and went with startling rapidity.",
    "They arrived\nfull of hope and they usually left in tears.",
    "But from the moment\nKatherine Grey set foot in Little Crampton ten years ago perfect\npeace had reigned.",
    "No one knows how these things come about.",
    "Snakecharmers they say are born not made.",

    "At\nthirtythree she was a quiet woman with those same grey eyes\nshining steadily out on the world with a kind of happy serenity that\nnothing could shake.",
    "Moreover she had been born with and still possessed a sense of\nhumour.",
    "As she sat at the breakfasttable staring in front of her there was\na ring at the bell accompanied by a very energetic ratatattat at\nthe knocker.",
    "In another minute the little maidservant opened the\ndoor and announced rather breathlessly\n\nDr Harrison.",
    "The big middleaged doctor came buzzing in with the energy and\nbreeziness that had been foreshadowed by his onslaught on the\nknocker.",
    "Good morning Miss Grey.",
    "Good morning Dr Harrison.",
    "I dropped in early began the doctor in case you should have\nheard from one of those Harfield cousins.",
    "Mrs Samuel she calls\nherself  a perfectly poisonous person.",
    "Without a word Katherine picked up Mrs Harfields letter from the\ntable and gave it to him.",
    "With a good deal of amusement she\nwatched his perusal of it the drawing together of the bushy\neyebrows the snorts and grunts of violent disapproval.",
    "He dashed\nit down again on the table.",
    "Perfectly monstrous he fumed.",
    "Dont you let it worry you my\ndear.",
    "Theyre talking through their hat.",
    "Mrs Harfields intellect was\nas good as yours or mine and you wont get anyone to say the\ncontrary.",
    "They wouldnt have a leg to stand upon and they know\nit.",
    "All that talk of taking it into court is pure bluff.",
    "Hence this\nattempt to get round you in a holeandcorner way.",

    "Dont\nget fancying its your duty to hand over the cash or any\ntomfoolery of conscientious scruples.",
    "Im afraid it hasnt occurred to me to have scruples said\nKatherine.",
    "All these people are distant relatives of Mrs Harfields\nhusband and they never came near her or took any notice of her\nin her lifetime.",
    "Youre a sensible woman said the doctor.",
    "I know none better\nthat youve had a hard life of it for the last ten years.",
    "Youre fully\nentitled to enjoy the old ladys savings such as they were.",
    "Katherine smiled thoughtfully.",
    "Such as they were she repeated.",
    "Youve no idea of the amount\ndoctor\n\nWell  enough to bring in five hundred a year or so I suppose.",
    "Katherine nodded.",
    "Thats what I thought she said.",
    "Now read this.",
    "She handed him the letter she had taken from the long blue\nenvelope.",
    "The doctor read and uttered an exclamation of utter\nastonishment.",
    "Impossible he muttered.",
    "Impossible.",
    "She was one of the original shareholders in Mortaulds.",
    "Forty\nyears ago she must have had an income of eight or ten thousand a\nyear.",
    "She has never I am sure spent more than four hundred a\nyear.",
    "She was always terribly careful about money.",
    "I always\nbelieved that she was obliged to be careful about every penny.",

    "My dear youre going to be a very rich woman.",
    "Katherine Grey nodded.",
    "Yes she said I am.",

    "Well said the doctor preparing to depart you have all my\ncongratulations.",
    "He flicked Mrs Samuel Harfields letter with his\nthumb.",
    "Dont worry about that woman and her odious letter.",
    "It really isnt an odious letter said Miss Grey tolerantly.",
    "Under\nthe circumstances I think its really quite a natural thing to do.",
    "I have the gravest suspicions of you sometimes said the doctor.",
    "Why\n\nThe things that you find perfectly natural.",
    "Katherine Grey laughed.",
    "Doctor Harrison retailed the great news to his wife at lunchtime.",
    "She was very excited about it.",
    "Fancy old Mrs Harfield  with all that money.",
    "Im glad she left it to\nKatherine Grey.",
    "That girls a saint.",
    "The doctor made a wry face.",
    "Saints I always imagine must have been difficult people.",

    "You might look in on her Polly he suggested.",
    "Im going to said Mrs Harrison promptly.",
    "She made her call about three oclock.",
    "My dear Im so glad she said warmly as she squeezed\nKatherines hand.",
    "And everyone in the village will be glad too.",
    "Its very nice of you to come and tell me said Katherine.",
    "I\nhoped you would come because I wanted to ask about Johnnie.",
    "Oh Johnnie.",
    "Well \n\nJohnnie was Mrs Harrisons youngest son.",
    "In another minute she\nwas off retailing a long history in which Johnnies adenoids and\ntonsils bulked largely.",
    "Katherine listened sympathetically.",
    "Habits\ndie hard.",
    "Listening had been her portion for ten years now.",
    "My\ndear I wonder if I ever told you about that naval ball at\nPortsmouth When Lord Charles admired my gown And\ncomposedly kindly Katherine would reply I rather think you\nhave Mrs Harfield but Ive forgotten about it.",
    "Wont you tell it me\nagain And then the old lady would start off full swing with\nnumerous details.",
    "And half of Katherines mind would be listening\nsaying the right things mechanically when the old lady paused...\n\nNow with that same curious feeling of duality to which she was\naccustomed she listened to Mrs Harrison.",
    "At the end of half an hour the latter recalled herself suddenly.",
    "Ive been talking about myself all this time she exclaimed.",
    "And I\ncame here to talk about you and your plans.",
    "I dont know that Ive got any yet.",
    "My dear  youre not going to stay on here.",
    "Katherine smiled at the horror in the others tone.",
    "No I think I want to travel.",
    "Ive never seen much of the world you\nknow.",
    "I should think not.",
    "It must have been an awful life for you cooped\nup here all these years.",
    "I dont know said Katherine.",
    "It gave me a lot of freedom.",
    "She caught the others gasp and reddened a little.",
    "It must sound foolish  saying that.",
    "Of course I hadnt much\nfreedom in the downright physical sense \n\nI should think not breathed Mrs Harrison remembering that\nKatherine had seldom had that useful thing as a day off.",
    "But in a way being tied physically gives you lots of scope\nmentally.",
    "Youre always free to think.",
    "Ive had a lovely feeling\nalways of mental freedom.",
    "Mrs Harrison shook her head.",
    "I cant understand that.",
    "Oh you would if youd been in my place.",
    "But all the same I feel I\nwant a change.",
    "I want  well I want things to happen.",
    "Oh Not to\nme  I dont mean that.",
    "But to be in the midst of things exciting\nthings  even if Im only the lookeron.",
    "You know things dont\nhappen in St Mary Mead.",
    "They dont indeed said Mrs Harrison with fervour.",
    "I shall go to London first said Katherine.",
    "I have to see the\nsolicitors anyway.",
    "After that I shall go abroad I think.",
    "Very nice.",
    "But of course first of all \n\nYes\n\nI must get some clothes.",
    "Exactly what I said to Arthur this morning cried the doctors\nwife.",
    "You know Katherine you could look possibly positively\nbeautiful if you tried.",
    "Miss Grey laughed unaffectedly.",
    "Oh I dont think you could ever make a beauty out of me she\nsaid sincerely.",
    "But I shall enjoy having some really good clothes.",
    "Im afraid Im talking about myself an awful lot.",
    "Mrs Harrison looked at her shrewdly.",
    "It must be quite a novel experience for you she said drily.",
    "Katherine went to say goodbye to old Miss Viner before leaving\nthe village.",
    "Miss Viner was two years older than Mrs Harfield and\n\n\fher mind was mainly taken up with her own success in outliving\nher dead friend.",
    "You wouldnt have thought Id have outlasted Jane Harfield\nwould you she demanded triumphantly of Katherine.",
    "We were\nat school together she and I.",
    "And here we are she taken and I\nleft.",
    "Who would have thought it\n\nYouve always eaten brown bread for supper havent you\nmurmured Katherine mechanically.",
    "Fancy your remembering that my dear.",
    "Yes if Jane Harfield had\nhad a slice of brown bread every evening and taken a little\nstimulant with her meals she might be here today.",
    "The old lady paused nodding her head triumphantly then added\nin sudden remembrance\n\nAnd so youve come into a lot of money I hear Well well.",
    "Take\ncare of it.",
    "And youre going up to London to have a good time\nDont think youll get married though my dear because you\nwont.",
    "Youre not the kind to attract the men.",
    "And besides youre\ngetting on.",
    "How old are you now\n\nThirtythree Katherine told her.",
    "Well remarked Miss Viner doubtfully thats not so very bad.",
    "Youve lost your first freshness of course.",
    "Im afraid so said Katherine much entertained.",
    "But youre a very nice girl said Miss Viner kindly.",
    "And Im sure\ntheres many a man might do worse than take you for a wife\ninstead of one of these flibbertigibbets running about nowadays\nshowing more of their legs than the Creator ever intended them\nto.",
    "Goodbye my dear and I hope youll enjoy yourself but things\nare seldom what they seem in this life.",
    "Heartened by these prophecies Katherine took her departure.",
    "Half the village came to see her off at the station including the\nlittle maid of all work Alice who brought a stiff wired nosegay and\ncried openly.",
    "There aint a many like her sobbed Alice when the train had\nfinally departed.",
    "Im sure when Charlie went back on me with that\ngirl from the Dairy nobody could have been kinder than Miss Grey\nwas and though particular about the brasses and the dust she\nwas always one to notice when youd give a thing an extra rub.",
    "Cut\nmyself in little pieces for her I would any day.",
    "A real lady thats\nwhat I call her.",
    "Such was Katherines departure from St Mary Mead.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nLADY TAMPLIN WRITES A LETTER\n\nWell said Lady Tamplin well.",
    "She laid down the continental Daily Mail and stared out across the\nblue waters of the Mediterranean.",
    "A branch of golden mimosa\nhanging just above her head made an effective frame for a very\ncharming picture.",
    "A goldenhaired blueeyed lady in a very\nbecoming negligee.",
    "That the golden hair owed something to art\nas did the pinkandwhite complexion was undeniable but the\nblue of the eyes was Natures gift and at fortyfour Lady Tamplin\ncould still rank as a beauty.",
    "Charming as she looked Lady Tamplin was for once not thinking\nof herself.",
    "That is to say she was not thinking of her appearance.",
    "She was intent on graver matters.",
    "Lady Tamplin was a wellknown\nfigure on the Riviera and her parties at the Villa Marguerite were\njustly celebrated.",
    "She was a woman of considerable experience\nand had had four husbands.",

    "Mr Charles\nEvans an extremely goodlooking young man of twentyseven\nwith delightful manners a keen love of sport and an appreciation\nof this worlds goods had no money of his own whatsoever.",
    "Lady\nTamplin was very pleased and satisfied with life generally but she\nhad occasional faint preoccupations about money.",
    "The button manufacturer had left his widow a considerable\nfortune but as Lady Tamplin was wont to say what with one\nthing and another  one thing being the depreciation of stocks\nowing to the war and the other the extravagances of the late Lord\nTamplin.",
    "She was still comfortably off.",
    "But to be merely\ncomfortably off is hardly satisfactory to one of Rosalie Tamplins\ntemperament.",
    "So on this particular January morning she opened her blue eyes\nextremely wide as she read a certain item of news and uttered\nthat noncommittal monosyllable Well.",
    "The only other occupant of the balcony was her daughter the Hon\nLenox Tamplin.",
    "A daughter such as Lenox was a sad thorn in Lady\nTamplins side a girl with no kind of tact who actually looked\nolder than her age and whose peculiar sardonic form of humour\nwas to say the least of it uncomfortable.",
    "Darling said Lady Tamplin just fancy.",
    "What is it\n\nLady Tamplin picked up the Daily Mail handed it to her daughter\nand indicated with an agitated forefinger the paragraph of\ninterest.",
    "Lenox read it without any of the signs of agitation shown by her\nmother.",

    "Well dear said Lady Tamplin I was thinking that if would be\nvery nice if I wrote to dear Katherine and suggested that she\nshould pay us a little visit out here.",
    "Naturally she is quite out of\ntouch with Society.",
    "It would be nicer for her to be launched by one\nof her own people.",
    "An advantage for her and an advantage for\nus.",
    "How much do you think you would get her to cough up asked\nLenox.",
    "Her mother looked at her reproachfully and murmured.",
    "We should have to come to some financial arrangement of\ncourse.",
    "What with one thing and another  the war  your poor\nfather \n\nAnd Chubby now said Lenox.",
    "He is an expensive luxury if you\nlike.",
    "She was a nice girl as I remember her murmured Lady Tamplin\npursuing her own line of thought quiet never wanted to shove\nherself forward not a beauty and never a manhunter.",
    "She will leave Chubby alone then said Lenox.",
    "Lady Tamplin looked at her in protest.",
    "Chubby would never  she began.",
    "No said Lenox I dont believe he would he knows a jolly sight\ntoo well which way his bread is buttered.",
    "Darling said Lady Tamplin you have such a coarse way of\nputting things.",
    "Sorry said Lenox.",
    "Lady Tamplin gathered up the Daily Mail and her negligee a\nvanitybag and various odd letters.",
    "I shall write to dear Katherine at once she said and remind her\nof the dear old days at Edgeworth.",
    "She went into the house a light of purpose shining in her eyes.",
    "Unlike Mrs Samuel Harfield correspondence flowed easily from\nher pen.",
    "She covered four sheets without pause or effort and on\nrereading it found no occasion to alter a word.",
    "Katherine received it on the morning of her arrival in London.",
    "Whether she read between the lines of it or not is another matter.",
    "She put it in her handbag and started out to keep the appointment\nshe had made with Mrs Harfields lawyers.",
    "The firm was an oldestablished one in Lincolns Inn Fields and\nafter a few minutes delay Katherine was shown into the presence\nof the senior partner a kindly elderly man with shrewd blue eyes\nand a fatherly manner.",
    "They discussed Mrs Harfields will and various legal matters for\nsome minutes then Katherine handed the lawyer Mrs Samuels\nletter.",
    "I had better show you this I suppose she said though it is\nreally rather ridiculous.",
    "He read it with a slight smile.",
    "Rather a crude attempt Miss Grey.",
    "I need hardly tell you I\nsuppose that these people have no claim of any kind upon the\n\n\festate and if they endeavour to contest the will no court will\nuphold them.",
    "I thought as much.",
    "Human nature is not always very wise.",
    "In Mrs Samuel Harfields\nplace I should have been more inclined to make an appeal to your\ngenerosity.",
    "That is one of the things I wanted to speak to you about.",
    "I should\nlike a certain sum to go to these people.",
    "There is no obligation.",
    "I know that.",
    "And they will not take it in the spirit it is meant.",
    "They will probably\nregard it as an attempt to pay them off though they will not refuse\nit on that account.",
    "I can see that and it cant be helped.",
    "I should advise you Miss Grey to put that idea out of your head.",
    "Katherine shook her head.",
    "You are quite right I know but I\nshould like it done all the same.",
    "They will grab at the money and abuse you all the more\nafterwards.",
    "Well said Katherine let them if they like.",
    "We all have our own\nways of enjoying ourselves.",
    "They were after all Mrs Harfields\nonly relatives and though they despised her as a poor relation\nand paid no attention to her when she was alive it seems to me\nunfair that they should be cut off with nothing.",
    "She carried her point though the lawyer was still unwilling and\nshe presently went out into the streets of London with a\ncomfortable assurance that she could spend the money freely and\nmake what plans she liked for the future.",
    "Her first action was to\nvisit the establishment of a famous dressmaker.",
    "A slim elderly Frenchwoman rather like a dreaming duchess\nreceived her and Katherine spoke with a certain naivet\u00e9.",
    "I want if I may to put myself in your hands.",
    "I have been very poor\nall my life and know nothing about clothes but now I have come\ninto some money and want to look really well dressed.",
    "The\n\nFrenchwoman\n\nwas\n\ncharmed.",
    "She\n\nhad\n\nan\n\nartists\n\ntemperament which had been soured earlier in the morning by a\nvisit from an Argentine meat queen who had insisted on having\nthose models least suited to her flamboyant type of beauty.",
    "She\nscrutinized Katherine with keen clever eyes.",
    "Yes  yes it will be\na pleasure Mademoiselle has a very good figure for her the\nsimple lines will be best.",

    "Marcelle my child the little mimosa suit\nof crepe de chine.",
    "It was a charming morning.",
    "Marcelle Clothilde Virginie bored\nand scornful passed slowly round squirming and wriggling in the\ntimehonoured fashion of mannequins.",
    "The Duchess stood by Katherine and made entries in a small\nnotebook.",
    "An excellent choice Mademoiselle.",
    "Mademoiselle has great go\u00fbt.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Mademoiselle cannot do better than those little suits\nif she is going to the Riviera as I suppose this winter.",
    "Let me see that evening dress once more said Katherine  the\npinky mauve one.",
    "Virginie appeared circling slowly.",
    "That is the prettiest of all said Katherine as she surveyed the\nexquisite draperies of mauve and grey and blue.",
    "What do you call\nit\n\nSoupir\n\ndautomne yes\n\nMademoiselle.",
    "yes that is\n\ntruly\n\nthe\n\ndress\n\nof\n\n\fWhat was there in these words that came back to Katherine with a\nfaint feeling of sadness after she had left the dressmaking\nestablishment.",
    "Soupir dautomne that is truly the dress of Mademoiselle.",
    "Autumn yes it was autumn for her.",
    "She who had never known\nspring or summer and would never know them now.",
    "Something\nshe had lost never could be given to her again.",

    "I am an idiot said Katherine.",
    "I am an idiot.",
    "What do I want\nWhy I was more contented a month ago than I am now.",
    "She drew out from her handbag the letter she had received that\nmorning from Lady Tamplin.",
    "Katherine was no fool.",
    "She\nunderstood the nuances of that letter as well as anybody and the\nreason of Lady Tamplins sudden show of affection towards a\nlongforgotten cousin was not lost upon her.",
    "It was for profit and\nnot for pleasure that Lady Tamplin was so anxious for the\ncompany of her dear cousin.",
    "Well why not There would be profit\non both sides.",
    "I will go said Katherine.",
    "She was walking down Piccadilly at the moment and turned into\nCooks to clinch the matter then and there.",
    "She had to wait for a\nfew minutes.",
    "The man with whom the clerk was engaged was also\ngoing to the Riviera.",
    "Everyone she felt was going.",
    "Well for the\nfirst time in her life she too would be doing what everybody did.",
    "The man in front of her turned abruptly and she stepped into his\nplace.",
    "She made her demand to the clerk but at the same time\nhalf of her mind was busy with something else.",
    "That mans face  in\nsome vague way it was familiar to her.",
    "Where had she seen him\nbefore Suddenly she remembered.",
    "It was in the Savoy outside\nher room that morning.",
    "She had collided with him in the passage.",
    "Rather an odd coincidence that she should run into him twice in a\nday.",
    "She glanced over her shoulder rendered uneasy by\nsomething she knew not what.",
    "The man was standing in the\ndoorway looking back at her.",
    "A cold shiver passed over\nKatherine she had a haunting sense of tragedy of doom\nimpending...\n\nThen she shook the impression from her with her usual good\nsense and turned her whole attention to what the clerk was\nsaying.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nAN OFFER REFUSED\n\nIt was rarely that Derek Kettering allowed his temper to get the\nbetter\n\nof\n\nhim.",
    "An\n\neasygoing\n\ninsouciance\n\nwas\n\nhis\n\nchief\n\ncharacteristic and it had stood him in good stead in more than one\ntight corner.",
    "Even now by the time he had left Mirelles flat he had\n\n\fcooled down.",
    "He had need of coolness.",
    "The corner he was in now\nwas a tighter one than he had ever been in before and unforeseen\nfactors had arisen with which for the moment he did not know\nhow to deal.",
    "He strolled along deep in thought.",
    "His brow was furrowed and\nthere was none of the easy jaunty manner which sat so well on\nhim.",
    "Various possibilities floated trough his mind.",
    "It might have\nbeen said of Derek Kettering that he was less of a fool than he\nlooked.",
    "He saw several roads that he might take  one in\nparticular.",
    "If he shrank from it it was for the moment only.",
    "Desperate ills need desperate remedies.",

    "He walked up St Jamess\nStreet across Piccadilly and strolled along it in the direction of\nPiccadilly Circus.",
    "As he passed the offices of Messrs. Thomas\nCook  Sons his footsteps slackened.",
    "He walked on however still\nturning the matter over in his mind.",
    "Finally he gave a brief nod of\nhis head turned sharply  so sharply as to collide with a couple of\npedestrians who were following in his footsteps and went back\nthe way he had come.",
    "This time he did not pass Cooks but went\nin.",
    "The office was comparatively empty and he got attended to at\nonce.",
    "I want to go to Nice next week.",
    "Will you give me particulars\n\nWhat date sir\n\n\fThe 14th.",
    "What is the best train\n\nWell of course the best train is what they call The Blue Train.",
    "You avoid the tiresome Customs business at Calais.",
    "Derek nodded.",
    "He knew all this none better.",
    "The 14th murmured the clerk that is rather soon.",
    "The Blue\nTrain is nearly always all booked up.",
    "See if there is a berth left said Derek.",

    "The clerk disappeared for a few minutes and presently returned.",
    "That is all right sir still three berths left.",
    "I will book you one of\nthem.",
    "What name\n\nPavett said Derek.",
    "He gave the address of his rooms in Jermyn\nStreet.",
    "The clerk nodded finished writing it down wished Derek good\nmorning politely and turned his attention to the next client.",
    "I want to go to Nice  on the 14th.",
    "Isnt there a train called the\nBlue Train\n\nDerek looked round sharply.",
    "Coincidence  a strange coincidence.",
    "He remembered his own\nhalfwhimsical words to Mirelle Portrait of a lady with grey eyes.",
    "I dont suppose I shall ever see her again.",
    "But he had seen her\nagain and what was more she proposed to travel to the Riviera\non the same day as he did.",
    "Just for a moment a shiver passed over him in some ways he was\nsuperstitious.",
    "He had said halflaughingly that this woman might\nbring him bad luck.",
    "Suppose  suppose that should prove to be\ntrue.",
    "From the doorway he looked back at her as she stood talking\nto the clerk.",
    "For once his memory had not played him false.",
    "A lady\n a lady in every sense of the word.",
    "Not very young not singularly\nbeautiful.",
    "But with something  grey eyes that might perhaps see\ntoo much.",
    "He knew as he went out of the door that in some way he\nwas afraid of this woman.",
    "He had a sense of fatality.",
    "He went back to his rooms in Jermyn Street and summoned his\nman.",
    "Take this cheque Pavett cash it first thing in the morning and\ngo around to Cooks in Piccadilly.",
    "They will have some tickets\nthere booked in your name pay for them and bring them back.",
    "Very good sir.",
    "Pavett withdrew.",
    "Derek strolled over to a sidetable and picked up a handful of\nletters.",
    "They were of a type only too familiar.",
    "Bills small bills and\nlarge bills one and all pressing for payment.",
    "The tone of the demands was still polite.",
    "Derek knew how soon that polite tone would change if  if certain\nnews became public property.",
    "He flung himself moodily into a large leathercovered chair.",
    "A\ndamned hole  that was what he was in.",
    "Yes a damned hole\n\nAnd ways of getting out of that damned hole were not too\npromising.",
    "Pavett appeared with a discreet cough.",
    "A gentleman to see you  sir  Major Knighton.",
    "Knighton eh\n\nDerek sat up frowned became suddenly alert.",
    "He said in a softer\ntone almost to himself\n\nKnighton  I wonder what is in the wind now\n\nShall I  er  show him in sir\n\nHis master nodded.",
    "When Knighton entered the room he found a\ncharming and genial host awaiting him.",
    "Very good of you to look me up said Derek.",
    "Knighton was nervous.",
    "The others keen eyes noticed that at once.",
    "The errand on which the secretary had come was clearly\ndistasteful to him.",
    "He replied almost mechanically to Dereks easy\nflow of conversation.",
    "He declined a drink and if anything his\nmanner became stiffer than before.",
    "Derek appeared at last to notice it.",
    "Well he said cheerfully what does my esteemed fatherinlaw\nwant with me You have come on his business I take it\n\nKnighton did not smile in reply.",
    "I have yes he said carefully.",
    "I  I wish Mr Van Aldin had chosen\nsomeone else.",
    "Derek raised his eyebrows in mock dismay.",
    "Is it as bad as all that I am not very thin skinned I can assure\nyou Knighton.",
    "No said Knighton but this \n\nHe paused.",
    "Derek eyed him keenly.",
    "Go on out with it he said kindly.",
    "I can imagine my dear fatherinlaws errands might not always be pleasant ones.",
    "Knighton cleared his throat.",
    "He spoke formally in tones that he\nstrove to render free of embarrassment.",
    "I am directed by Mr Van Aldin to make you a definite offer.",
    "An offer For a moment Derek showed his surprise.",
    "Knightons\nopening words were clearly not what he had expected.",
    "He offered\na cigarette to Knighton lit one himself and sank back in his chair\nmurmuring in a slightly sardonic voice\n\nAn offer That sounds rather interesting.",
    "Shall I go on\n\nPlease.",
    "You must forgive my surprise but it seems to me that my\ndear fatherinlaw has rather climbed down since our chat this\nmorning.",
    "And climbing down is not what one associates with\nstrong men.",
    "Napoleons of finance etc.",
    "It shows  I think it shows\nthat he finds his position weaker than he thought it.",
    "Knighton listened politely to the easy mocking voice but no sign\nof any kind showed itself on his rather stolid countenance.",
    "He waited until Derek had finished and then he said quietly\n\nI will state the proposition in the fewest possible words.",
    "Knighton did not look at the other.",
    "His voice was curt and matteroffact.",
    "The matter is simply this.",
    "Mrs Kettering as you know is about to\nfile a petition for divorce.",
    "If the case goes undefended you will\nreceive one hundred thousand on the day that the decree is made\nabsolute.",
    "Derek in the act of lighting his cigarette suddenly stopped dead.",
    "A hundred thousand he said sharply.",
    "Dollars\n\nPounds.",
    "There was dead silence for at least two minutes.",
    "Kettering had his\nbrows together linking.",
    "A hundred thousand pounds.",
    "It meant\nMirelle and a continuance of his pleasant carefree life.",
    "It meant\nthat Van Aldin knew something.",
    "Van Aldin did not pay for nothing.",
    "He got up and stood by the chimneypiece.",
    "And in the event of my refusing his handsome offer he asked\nwith a cold ironical politeness.",
    "Knighton made a deprecating gesture.",
    "I can assure you Mr Kettering he said earnestly that it is with\nthe utmost unwillingness that I came here with this message.",
    "Thats all right said Kettering.",
    "Dont distress yourself its not\nyour fault.",
    "Now then  I asked you a question will you answer it\n\n\fKnighton also rose.",
    "He spoke more reluctantly than before.",
    "In the event of your refusing this proposition he said Mr Van\nAldin wished me to tell you in plain words that he proposes to\nbreak you.",
    "Just that.",
    "Kettering raised his eyebrows but he retained his light amused\nmanner.",
    "Well well he said I suppose he can do it.",
    "I certainly should not\nbe able to put up much of a fight against Americas man of\nmillions.",
    "A hundred thousand If you are going to bribe a man\nthere is nothing like doing it thoroughly.",
    "Supposing I were to tell\nyou that for two hundred thousand Id do what he wanted what\nthen\n\nI would take your message back to Mr Van Aldin said Knighton\nunemotionally.",
    "Is that your answer\n\nNo said Derek funnily enough it is not.",
    "You can go back to my\nfatherinlaw and tell him to take himself and his bribes to hell.",
    "Is\nthat clear\n\nPerfectly said Knighton.",
    "He got up hesitated and then flushed.",
    "I  you will allow me to say Mr Kettering that I am glad you have\nanswered as you have.",
    "Derek did not reply.",
    "When the other had left the room he remained\nfor a minute or two lost in thought.",
    "A curious smile came to his\nlips.",
    "And that is that he said softly.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nON THE BLUE TRAIN\n\nDad\n\nMrs Kettering started violently.",
    "Her nerves were not completely\nunder control this morning.",
    "Very perfectly dressed in a long mink\ncoat and a little hat of Chinese lacquer red she had been walking\nalong the crowded platform of Victoria deep in thought and her\nfathers sudden appearance and hearty greeting had an unlookedfor effect upon her.",
    "Why Ruth how you jumped\n\nI didnt expect to see you I suppose Dad.",
    "You said goodbye to\nme last night and said you had a conference this morning.",
    "So I have said Van Aldin but you are more to me than any\nnumber of darned conferences.",
    "I came to take a last look at you\nsince I am not going to see you for some time.",
    "That is very sweet of you Dad.",
    "I wish you were coming too.",
    "What would you say if I did\n\nThe remark was merely a joking one.",
    "He was surprised to see the\nquick colour flame in Ruths cheeks.",
    "For a moment he almost\nthought he saw dismay flash out of her eyes.",
    "She laughed uncertainly and nervously.",
    "Just for a moment I really thought you meant it she said.",
    "Would you have been pleased\n\nOf course.",
    "She spoke with exaggerated emphasis.",
    "Well said Van Aldin thats good.",
    "It isnt really for very long Dad continued Ruth you know you\nare coming out next month.",
    "Ah said Van Aldin unemotionally sometimes I guess I will go to\none of these smug guys in Harley Street and have him tell me that I\nneed sunshine and change of air right away.",
    "Dont be so lazy cried Ruth next month is ever so much nicer\nthan this month out there.",
    "You have got all sorts of things.",
    "You\ncant possibly leave just now.",
    "Well thats so I suppose said Van Aldin with a sigh.",
    "You had\nbetter be getting on board this train of yours Ruth.",
    "Which is your\nseat\n\nRuth Kettering looked vaguely up at the train.",
    "At the door of one of\nthe Pullman cars a thin tall woman dressed in black was standing\n Ruth Ketterings maid.",
    "She drew aside as her mistress came up\nto her.",
    "I have put your dressingcase under your seat Madam in case\nyou should need it.",
    "Shall I take the rugs or will you require one\n\nNo no I shant want one.",
    "Better go and find your own seat now\nMason.",
    "Yes Madam.",
    "The maid departed.",
    "Van Aldin entered the Pullman car with Ruth.",
    "She found her seat\nand Van Aldin deposited various papers and magazines on the\ntable in front of her.",
    "The seat opposite to her was already taken\nand the American gave a cursory glance at its occupant.",
    "He had a\nfleeting impression of attractive grey eyes and a neat travelling\ncostume.",
    "He indulged in a little more desultory conversation with\nRuth the kind of talk peculiar to those seeing other people off by\ntrain.",
    "Presently as whistles blew he glanced at his watch.",
    "I had best be clearing out of here.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Dont worry I will\nattend to things.",
    "Oh father\n\nHe turned back sharply.",
    "There had been something in Ruths\nvoice something so entirely foreign to her usual manner that he\nwas startled.",
    "It was almost a cry of despair.",
    "She had made an\nimpulsive movement towards him but in another minute she was\nmistress of herself once more.",
    "Till next month she said cheerfully.",
    "Two minutes later the train started.",
    "Ruth sat very still biting her\nunder lip and trying hard to keep the unaccustomed tears from\nher eyes.",
    "She felt a sudden sense of horrible desolation.",
    "There\nwas a wild longing upon her to jump out of the train and to go back\nbefore it was too late.",
    "She so calm so selfassured for the first\ntime in her life felt like a leaf swept by the wind.",
    "If her father knew what would he say\n\nMadness Yes just that madness For the first time in her life she\nwas swept away by emotion swept away to the point of doing a\nthing which even she knew to be incredibly foolish and reckless.",
    "She was enough Van Aldins daughter to realize her own folly and\nlevelheaded enough to condemn her own action.",
    "But she was his\ndaughter in another sense also.",
    "She had that same iron\ndetermination that would have what it wanted and once it had\nmade up its mind would not be balked.",
    "From her cradle she had\nbeen selfwilled the very circumstances of her life had developed\n\n\fthat selfwill in her.",
    "It drove her now remorselessly.",
    "Well the die\nwas cast.",
    "She must go through with it now.",
    "She looked up and her eyes met those of the woman sitting\nopposite.",
    "She had a sudden fancy that in some way this other\nwoman had read her mind.",

    "It was only a fleeting impression.",
    "The faces of both women\nhardened to wellbred impassiveness.",
    "Mrs Kettering took up a\nmagazine and Katherine Grey looked out of the window and\nwatched a seemingly endless vista of depressing streets and\nsuburban houses.",

    "In spite of herself a thousand apprehensions\npreyed on her mind.",
    "What a fool she had been What a fool she\nwas Like all cool and selfsufficient people when she did lose her\nselfcontrol she lost it thoroughly  it was too late... Was it too late\nOh for someone to speak to for someone to advise her.",
    "She had\nnever before had such a wish she would have scorned the idea of\nrelying on any judgment other than her own but now  what was\nthe matter with her Panic.",
    "Yes that would describe it best panic.",
    "She Ruth Kettering was completely and utterly panic\nstricken.",
    "She stole a covert glance at the figure opposite.",
    "If only she knew someone like that some nice cool calm\nsympathetic creature.",
    "That was the sort of person one could talk to.",
    "But you cant of\ncourse confide in a stranger.",

    "After\ndisembarking at Calais and settling herself down with her maid in\nher double compartment in the Blue Train she went along to the\nluncheon car.",
    "It was with a little shock of surprise that she found herself set\ndown to a small table with opposite her the same woman who\nhad been her vis\u0430vis in the Pullman.",
    "A faint smile came to the lips\nof both women.",
    "This is quite a coincidence said Mrs Kettering.",
    "I know said Katherine it is odd the way things happen.",
    "A flying attendant shot up to them with the wonderful velocity\nalways displayed by the Compagnie Internationale des WagonsLits and deposited two cups of soup.",

    "For ten years I have been a paid\ncompanion with just enough money of my own to buy myself\nstrong country shoes now I have been left what seems to me a\nfortune though I dare say it would not seem so to you.",
    "Now I wonder why you say that  that it would not seem so to me.",
    "Katherine laughed.",
    "I dont really know.",
    "I suppose one forms\nimpressions without thinking of it.",
    "I put you down in my own mind\nas one of the very rich of the earth.",
    "It was just an impression.",
    "I\ndare say I am wrong.",
    "No said Ruth you are not wrong.",
    "She had suddenly become very grave.",

    "Oh please dont be conventional.",
    "I want to know.",
    "As we left\nVictoria I looked across at you and I had the sort of feeling that\nyou  well understood what was going on in my mind.",
    "I can assure you I am not a mind reader said Katherine smiling.",
    "No but will you tell me please just what you thought.",
    "Ruths\neagerness was so intense and so sincere that she carried her\npoint.",
    "I will tell you if you like but you must not think me impertinent.",
    "I\nthought that for some reason you were in great distress of mind\nand I was sorry for you.",
    "You are right.",
    "You are quite right.",
    "I am in terrible trouble.",
    "I  I\nshould like to tell you something about it if I may.",
    "Oh dear Katherine thought to herself how extraordinarily\nalike the world seems to be everywhere People were always\ntelling me things in St Mary Mead and it is just the same thing\nhere and I dont really want to hear anybodys troubles\n\nShe replied politely\n\nDo tell me.",
    "They were just finishing their lunch.",
    "Ruth gulped down her coffee\nrose from her seat and quite oblivious of the fact that Katherine\nhad not begun to sip her coffee said Come to my compartment\nwith me.",
    "They were two single compartments with a communicating door\nbetween them.",
    "In the second of them a thin maid whom Katherine\nhad noticed at Victoria was sitting very upright on the seat\nclutching a big scarlet morocco case with the initials R.V.K.",
    "on it.",
    "Mrs Kettering pulled the communicating door to and sank down on\nthe seat.",
    "Katherine sat down beside her.",
    "I am in trouble and I dont know what to do.",
    "There is a man whom\nI am fond of  very fond of indeed.",
    "We cared for each other when\nwe were young and we were thrust apart most brutally and\nunjustly.",
    "Now we have come together again.",
    "Yes\n\n\fI  I am going to meet him now.",
    "Oh I dare say you think it is all\nwrong but you dont know the circumstances.",
    "My husband is\nimpossible.",
    "He has treated me disgracefully.",
    "Yes said Katherine again.",
    "What I feel so badly about is this.",
    "I have deceived my father  it\nwas he who came to see me off at Victoria today.",
    "He wishes me to\ndivorce my husband and of course he has no idea  that I am\ngoing to meet this other man.",
    "He would think it extraordinarily\nfoolish.",
    "Well dont you think it is\n\nI suppose it is.",
    "Ruth Kettering looked down at her hands they were shaking\nviolently.",
    "But I cant draw back now.",
    "Why not\n\nI  it is all arranged and it would break his heart.",
    "Dont you believe it said Katherine robustly hearts are pretty\ntough.",
    "He will think I have no courage no strength of purpose.",
    "It seems to me an awfully silly thing that you are going to do\nsaid Katherine.",
    "I think you realize that yourself.",
    "Ruth Kettering buried her face in her hands.",
    "I dont know  I dont\nknow.",
    "Ever since I left Victoria I have had a horrible feeling of\nsomething  something that is coming to me very soon  that I cant\nescape.",
    "She clutched convulsively at Katherines hand.",
    "You must think I am mad talking to you like this but I tell you I\nknow something horrible is going to happen.",
    "Dont think it said Katherine try to pull yourself together.",
    "You\ncould send your father a wire from Paris if you like and he would\ncome to you at once.",
    "The other brightened.",
    "Yes I could do that.",
    "Dear old Dad.",
    "It is queer  but I never knew\nuntil today how terribly fond of him I am.",
    "She sat up and dried her\neyes with a handkerchief.",
    "I have been very foolish.",
    "Thank you so\nmuch for letting me talk to you.",
    "I dont know why I got into such a\nqueer hysterical state.",
    "She got up.",
    "I am quite all right now.",
    "I suppose really I just\nneeded someone to talk to.",
    "I cant think now why I have been\nmaking such an absolute fool of myself.",
    "Katherine got up too.",
    "I am so glad you feel better she said trying to make her voice\nsound as conventional as possible.",
    "She was only too well aware\nthat the aftermath of confidences is embarrassment.",
    "She added\ntactfully\n\nI must be going back to my own compartment.",
    "She emerged into the corridor at the same time as the maid was\nalso coming out from the next door.",
    "The latter looked towards\nKatherine over her shoulder and an expression of intense\nsurprise showed itself on her face.",
    "Katherine turned also but by\nthat time whoever it was who had aroused the maids interest had\nretreated into his or her compartment and the corridor was\nempty.",
    "Katherine walked down it to regain her own place which\nwas in the next coach.",
    "As she passed the end compartment the\ndoor opened and a womans face looked out for a moment and\nthen pulled the door to sharply.",
    "It was a face not easily forgotten as Katherine was to know when\nshe saw it again.",
    "A beautiful face oval and dark very heavily\nmade up in a bizarre fashion.",
    "Katherine had a feeling that she had\nseen it before somewhere.",
    "She regained her own compartment without other adventure and\nsat for some time thinking of the confidence which had just been\nmade to her.",
    "She wondered idly who the woman in the mink coat\nmight be wondered also how the end of her story would turn out.",
    "If I have stopped anyone from making an idiot of themselves I\nsuppose I have done good work she thought to herself.",
    "But who\nknows That is the kind of woman who is hardheaded and\negotistical all her life and it might be good for her to do the other\nsort of thing for a change.",
    "Oh well  I dont suppose I shall ever\nsee her again.",
    "She certainly wont want to see me again.",
    "That is\nthe worst of letting people tell you things.",
    "They never do.",
    "She hoped that she would not be given the same table at dinner.",
    "She reflected not without humour that it might be awkward for\nboth of them.",
    "Leaning back with her head against a cushion she\nfelt tired and vaguely depressed.",
    "They had reached Paris and the\nslow journey round the ceinture with its interminable stops and\nwaits was very wearisome.",
    "When they arrived at the Gare de Lyon she was glad to get out and\nwalk up and down the platform.",
    "The keen cold air was refreshing\nafter the steamheated train.",
    "She observed with a smile that her friend of the mink coat was\nsolving the possible awkwardness of the dinner problem in her\nown way.",
    "A dinner basket was being handed up and received\nthrough the window by the maid.",
    "When the train started once more and dinner was announced by a\nviolent ringing of bells Katherine went along to it much relieved in\nmind.",
    "Her vis\u0430vis tonight was of an entirely different kind  a\nsmall man distinctly foreign in appearance with a rigidly waxed\nmoustache and an eggshaped head which he carried rather on\none side.",
    "Katherine had taken in a book to dinner with her.",
    "She\n\n\ffound the little mans eyes fixed on it with a kind of twinkling\namusement.",
    "I see Madame that you have a Roman Policier.",
    "You are fond of\nsuch things\n\nThey amuse me Katherine admitted.",
    "The little man nodded with the air of complete understanding.",
    "They have a good sale always so I am told.",
    "Now why is that eh\nMademoiselle I ask it of you as a student of human nature  why\nshould that be\n\nKatherine felt more and more amused.",
    "Perhaps they give one the illusion of living an exciting life she\nsuggested.",
    "He nodded gravely.",
    "Yes there is something in that.",
    "Of course one knows that such things dont really happen\nKatherine was continuing but he interrupted her sharply.",
    "Sometimes Mademoiselle Sometimes I who speak to you  they\nhave happened to me.",
    "She threw him a quick interested glance.",
    "Some day who knows you might be in the thick of things he\nwent on.",
    "It is all chance.",
    "I dont think it is likely said Katherine Nothing of that kind ever\nhappens to me.",
    "He leaned forward.",
    "Would you like it to\n\nThe question startled her and she drew in her breath sharply.",
    "It is my fancy perhaps said the little man as he dexterously\npolished one of the forks but I think that you have a yearning in\nyou for interesting happenings.",
    "Eh bien Mademoiselle all through\nmy life I have observed one thing  All one wants one gets Who\nknows His face screwed itself up comically.",
    "You may get more\nthan you bargain for.",
    "Is that a prophecy asked Katherine smiling as she rose from\nthe table.",
    "The little man shook his head.",
    "I never prophesy he declared pompously.",
    "It is true that I have\nthe habit of being always right  but I do not boast of it.",
    "Goodnight Mademoiselle and may you sleep well.",
    "Katherine went back along the train amused and entertained by\nher little neighbour.",
    "She passed the open door of her friends compartment and saw\nthe conductor making up the bed.",
    "The lady in the mink coat was\nstanding looking out of the window.",
    "The second compartment as\nKatherine saw trough the communicating door was empty with\nrugs and bags heaped up on the mat.",
    "The maid was not there.",
    "Katherine found her own bed prepared and since she was tired\nshe went to bed and switched off her light about halfpast nine.",
    "She woke with a sudden start how much time had passed she did\nnot know.",
    "Glancing at her watch she found that it had stopped.",
    "A feeling of intense uneasiness pervaded her and grew stronger\nmoment by moment.",
    "At last she got up threw her dressinggown\nround her shoulders and stepped out into the corridor.",
    "The whole\ntrain seemed wrapped in slumber.",
    "Katherine let down the window\nand sat by it for some minutes drinking in the cool night air and\ntrying vainly to calm her uneasy fears.",
    "She presently decided that\nshe would go along to the end and ask the conductor for the right\ntime so that she could set her watch.",
    "She found however that his\nlittle chair was vacant.",
    "She hesitated for a moment and then walked through into the next\ncoach.",
    "She looked down the long dim line of the corridor and\nsaw to her surprise that a man was standing with his hand on the\ndoor of the compartment occupied by the lady in the mink coat.",
    "That is to say she thought it was the compartment.",
    "Probably\n\n\fhowever she was mistaken.",
    "He stood there for a moment or two\nwith his back to her seeming uncertain and hesitating in his\nattitude.",
    "Then he slowly turned and with an odd feeling of fatality\nKatherine recognized him as the same man whom she had noticed\ntwice before  once in the corridor of the Savoy Hotel and once in\nCooks offices.",
    "Then he opened the door of the compartment and\npassed in drawing it to behind him.",
    "An idea flashed across Katherines mind.",
    "Could this be the man of\nwhom the other woman had spoken  the man she was journeying\nto meet.",
    "Then Katherine told herself that she was romancing.",
    "In all\nprobability she had mistaken the compartment.",
    "She went back to her own carriage.",
    "Five minutes later the train\nslackened speed.",
    "There was the long plaintive hiss of the Westinghouse brake and\na few minutes later the train came to a stop at Lyons.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nMURDER\n\nKatherine wakened the next morning to brilliant sunshine.",
    "She\nwent along to breakfast early but met none of her acquaintances\nof the day before.",
    "When she returned to her compartment it had\n\n\fjust been restored to its daytime appearance by the conductor a\ndark man with a drooping moustache and melancholy face.",
    "Madame is fortunate he said the sun shines.",
    "It is always a\ngreat disappointment to passengers when they arrive on a grey\nmorning.",
    "I should have been disappointed certainly said Katherine.",
    "The man prepared to depart.",
    "We are rather late Madame he said.",
    "I will let you know just\nbefore we get to Nice.",
    "Katherine nodded.",
    "She sat by the window entranced by the sunlit\npanorama.",
    "The palid trees the deep blue of the sea the bright\nyellow mimosa came with all the charm of novelty to the woman\nwho for fourteen years had known only the drab winters of\nEngland.",
    "When they arrived at Cannes Katherine got out and walked up\nand down the platform.",
    "She was curious about the lady in the mink\ncoat and looked up at the windows of her compartment.",
    "The\nblinds were still drawn down  the only ones to be so on the whole\ntrain.",
    "Katherine wondered a little and when she reentered the\ntrain she passed along the corridor and noticed that these two\ncompartments were still shuttered and closed.",
    "The lady of the\nmink coat was clearly no early riser.",
    "Presently the conductor came to her and told her that in a few\nminutes the train would arrive at Nice.",
    "Katherine handed him a tip\nthe man thanked her but still lingered.",
    "There was something odd about him.",
    "Katherine who had at first\nwondered whether the tip had not been big enough was now\nconvinced that something far more serious was amiss.",
    "His face\nwas of a sickly pallor he was shaking all over and looked as if he\nhad been frightened out of his life.",
    "He was eyeing her in a curious\nmanner.",
    "Presently he said abruptly Madame will excuse me but\nis she expecting friends to meet her at Nice\n\nProbably said Katherine.",
    "Why\n\nBut the man merely shook his head and murmured something that\nKatherine could not catch and moved away not reappearing until\nthe train came to rest at the station when he started handing her\nbelongings down from the window.",
    "Katherine stood for a moment or two on the platform rather at a\nloss but a fair young man with an ingenuous face came up to her\nand said rather hesitatingly\n\nMiss Grey is it not\n\nKatherine said that it was and the young man beamed upon her\nseraphically and murmured\n\nI am Chubby you know  Lady Tamplins husband.",
    "I expect she\nmentioned me but perhaps she forgot.",
    "Have you got your billet de\n\n\fbagages I lost mine when I came out this year and you would not\nbelieve the fuss they made about it.",
    "Regular French red tape\n\nKatherine produced it and was just about to move off beside him\nwhen a very gentle and insidious voice murmured in her ear\n\nA little moment Madame if you please.",
    "Katherine turned to behold an individual who made up for\ninsignificance of stature by a large quantity of gold lace and\nuniform.",
    "The individual explained.",
    "There were certain formalities.",
    "Madame\nwould perhaps be so kind as to accompany him.",
    "The regulations\nof the police  He threw up his arms.",
    "Absurd doubtless but\nthere it was.",
    "Mr Chubby Evans listened with a very imperfect comprehension\nhis French being of a limited order.",
    "So like the French murmured Mr Evans.",
    "He was one of those\nstaunch patriotic Britons who having made a portion of a foreign\ncountry their own strongly resent the original inhabitants of it.",
    "Always up to some silly dodge or other.",
    "Theyve never tackled\npeople on the station before though.",
    "This is something quite new.",
    "I suppose youll have to go.",
    "Katherine departed with her guide.",
    "Somewhat to her surprise he\nled her towards a siding where a coach of the departed train had\nbeen shunted.",
    "He invited her to mount into this and preceding\n\n\fher down the corridor held aside the door of one of the\ncompartments.",
    "In it was a pompouslooking official personage and with him a\nnondescript being who appeared to be a clerk.",
    "The pompouslooking personage rose politely bowed to Katherine and said\n\nYou will excuse me Madame but there are certain formalities to\nbe complied with.",
    "Madame speaks French I trust\n\nSufficiently I think Monsieur replied Katherine in that\nlanguage.",
    "That is good.",
    "Pray be seated Madame.",
    "I am M. Caux the\nCommissary of Police.",
    "He blew out his chest importantly and Katherine tried to look\nsufficiently impressed.",
    "You wish to see my passport she inquired.",
    "Here it is.",
    "The Commissary eyed her keenly and gave a little grunt.",
    "Thank you Madame he said taking the passport from her.",
    "He\ncleared his throat.",
    "But what I really desire is a little information.",
    "Information\n\n\fThe Commissary nodded his head slowly.",
    "About a lady who has been a fellowpassenger of yours.",
    "You\nlunched with her yesterday.",
    "I am afraid I cant tell you anything about her.",
    "We fell into\nconversation over our meal but she is a complete stranger to me.",
    "I have never seen her before.",
    "And yet said the Commissary sharply you returned to her\ncompartment with her after lunch and sat talking for some time\n\nYes said Katherine that is true.",
    "The Commissary seemed to expect her to say something more.",
    "He\nlooked at her encouragingly.",
    "Yes Madame\n\nWell Monsieur said Katherine.",
    "You can perhaps give me some kind of idea of that\nconversation\n\nI could said Katherine but at the moment I see no reason to do\nso.",
    "In somewhat British fashion she felt annoyed.",
    "This foreign official seemed to her impertinent.",
    "No reason cried the Commissary.",
    "Oh yes Madame I can\nassure you that there is a reason.",
    "Then perhaps you will give it to me.",
    "The Commissary rubbed his chin thoughtfully for a minute or two\nwithout speaking.",
    "Madame he said at last the reason is very simple.",
    "The lady in\nquestion was found dead in her compartment this morning.",
    "Dead gasped Katherine.",
    "What was it  heart failure\n\nNo said the Commissary in a reflective voice.",
    "No  she was\nmurdered.",
    "Murdered cried Katherine.",
    "So you see Madame why we are anxious for any information we\ncan possibly get.",
    "But surely her maid \n\nThe maid has disappeared.",
    "Oh Katherine paused to assemble her thoughts.",
    "Since the conductor had seen you talking with her in her\ncompartment he quite naturally reported the fact to the police\n\n\fand that is why Madame we have detained you in the hope of\ngaining some information.",
    "I am very sorry said Katherine I dont even know her name.",
    "Her name is Kettering.",
    "That we know from her passport and from\nthe labels on her luggage.",
    "If we \n\nThere was a knock on the compartment door.",
    "M. Caux frowned.",
    "He opened it about six inches.",
    "What is the matter he said peremptorily.",
    "I cannot be\ndisturbed.",
    "The eggshaped head of Katherines dinner acquaintance showed\nitself in the aperture.",
    "On his face was a beaming smile.",
    "My name he said is Hercule Poirot.",
    "Not the Commissary stammered not the Hercule Poirot\n\nThe same said Mr Poirot.",
    "I remember meeting you once M.\nCaux at the S\u00fbret\u00e9 in Paris though doubtless you have forgotten\nme\n\nNot at all Monsieur not at all declared the Commissary\nheartily.",
    "But enter I pray of you.",
    "You know of this \n\nYes I know said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I came to see if I might be of\nany assistance\n\n\fWe should be flattered replied the Commissary promptly.",
    "Let\nme present you Mr Poirot to  he consulted the passport he still\nheld in his hand  to Madame  er  Mademoiselle Grey.",
    "Poirot smiled across at Katherine.",
    "It is strange is it not he murmured that my words should have\ncome true so quickly\n\nMademoiselle alas can tell us very little said the Commissary.",
    "I have been explaining said Katherine that this poor lady was\na complete stranger to me.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "But she talked to you did she not he said gently.",
    "You formed\nan impression  is it not so\n\nYes said Katherine thoughtfully.",
    "I suppose I did.",
    "And that\nimpression was \n\nYes Mademoiselle  the Commissary jerked himself forward let us by all means have your impressions.",
    "Katherine sat turning the whole thing over in her mind.",
    "She felt in\na way as if she were betraying a confidence but with that ugly\nword Murder ringing in her ears she dared not keep anything\nback.",
    "Too much might hang upon it.",
    "So as nearly as she could\n\n\fshe repeated word for word the conversation she had had with the\ndead woman.",
    "That is interesting said the Commissary glancing at the other.",
    "Eh M. Poirot that is interesting Whether it has anything to do\nwith the crime  He left the sentence unfinished.",
    "I suppose it could not be suicide said Katherine rather\ndoubtfully.",
    "No said the Commissary it could not be suicide.",
    "She was\nstrangled with a length of black cord.",
    "Oh Katherine shivered.",
    "M. Caux spread out his hands\napologetically.",
    "It is not nice  no.",
    "I think that our train robbers are\nmore brutal than they are in your country.",
    "It is horrible.",
    "Yes yes  he was soothing and apologetic  but you have great\ncourage Mademoiselle.",
    "At once as soon as I saw you I said to\nmyself Mademoiselle has great courage.",
    "That is why I am going\nto ask you to do something more  something distressing but I\nassure you very necessary.",
    "Katherine looked at him apprehensively.",
    "He spread out his hands apologetically.",
    "I am going to ask you Mademoiselle to be so good as to\naccompany me to the next compartment.",
    "Must I asked Katherine in a low voice.",
    "Someone must identify her said the Commissary and since the\nmaid has disappeared  he coughed significantly  you appear to\nbe the person who has seen most of her since she joined the\ntrain.",
    "Very well said Katherine quietly if it is necessary \n\nShe rose.",
    "Poirot gave her a little nod of approval.",
    "Mademoiselle is sensible he said.",
    "May I accompany you M.\nCaux\n\nEnchanted my dear M. Poirot.",
    "They went out into the corridor and M. Caux unlocked the door of\nthe dead womans compartment.",
    "The blinds on the far side had\nbeen drawn halfway up to admit light.",
    "The dead woman lay on the\nberth to their left in so natural a posture that one could have\nthought her asleep.",
    "The bedclothes were drawn up over her and\nher head was turned to the wall so that only the red auburn curls\nshowed.",
    "Very gently M. Caux laid a hand on her shoulder and\nturned the body back so that the face came into view.",
    "Katherine\nflinched a little and dug her nails into her palms.",
    "A heavy blow had\ndisfigured the features almost beyond recognition.",
    "Poirot gave a\nsharp exclamation.",
    "When was that done I wonder he demanded.",
    "Before death or\nafter\n\nThe doctor says after said M. Caux.",
    "Strange said Poirot drawing his brows together.",
    "He turned to Katherine.",
    "Be brave Mademoiselle look at her well.",
    "Are you sure that this is the woman you talked to in the train\nyesterday\n\nKatherine had good nerves.",
    "She steeled herself to look long and\nearnestly at the recumbent figure.",
    "Then she leaned forward and\ntook up the dead womans hand.",
    "I am quite sure she replied at length.",
    "The face is too disfigured\nto recognize but the build and carriage and hair are exact and\nbesides I noticed this  she pointed to a tiny mole on the dead\nwomans wrist  while I was talking to her.",
    "Bon\n\napproved\n\nPoirot.",
    "You\n\nare\n\nan\n\nexcellent\n\nwitness\n\nMademoiselle.",
    "There is then no question as to the identity but it is\nstrange all the same.",
    "He frowned down on the dead woman in\nperplexity.",
    "M. Caux shrugged his shoulders.",
    "The murderer was carried away by rage doubtless he\nsuggested.",
    "If\n\nshe\n\nhad\n\nbeen\n\nstruck\n\ndown\n\nit\n\nwould\n\nhave\n\nbeen\n\ncomprehensible mused Poirot but the man who strangled her\nslipped up behind and caught her unawares.",
    "A little choke  a little\ngurgle  that is all that would be heard and then afterwards  that\nsmashing blow on her face.",
    "Now why Did he hope that if the face\nwere unrecognizable she might not be identified Or did he hate\nher so much that he could not resist striking that blow even after\nshe was dead\n\nKatherine shuddered and he turned at once to her kindly.",
    "You must not let me distress you Mademoiselle he said.",
    "To\nyou this is all very terrible.",
    "To me alas it is an old story.",
    "One\nmoment I pray of you both.",
    "They stood against the door watching him as he went quickly\nround the compartment.",
    "He noted the dead womans clothes\nneatly folded on the end of the berth the big fur coat that hung\nfrom a hook and the little red lacquer hat tossed up on the rack.",
    "Then he passed through into the adjoining compartment that in\nwhich Katherine had seen the maid sitting.",
    "Here the berth had not\nbeen made up.",
    "Three or four rugs were piled loosely on the seat\nthere was a hatbox and a couple of suitcases.",
    "He turned suddenly\nto Katherine.",
    "You were in here yesterday he said.",
    "Do you see anything\nchanged anything missing\n\nKatherine looked carefully round both compartments.",
    "Yes she said there is something missing  a scarlet morocco\ncase.",
    "It had the initials R.V.K.",
    "on it.",
    "It might have been a small\ndressingcase or a big jewelcase.",
    "When I saw it the maid was\nholding it.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "But surely said Katherine.",
    "I  of course I dont know anything\nabout such things but surely it is plain enough if the maid and the\njewelcase are missing\n\nYou mean that it was the maid who was the thief No\nMademoiselle there is a very good reason against that said the\nCommissary.",
    "What\n\nThe maid was left behind in Paris.",
    "He turned to Poirot.",
    "I should like you to hear the conductors story yourself he\nmurmured confidentially.",
    "It is very suggestive.",
    "Mademoiselle would doubtless like to hear it also said Poirot.",
    "You do not object Monsieur le Commissaire\n\nNo said the Commissary who clearly did object very much.",
    "No certainly M. Poirot if you say so.",
    "You have finished here\n\n\fI think so.",
    "One little minute.",
    "He had been turning over the rugs and now he took one to the\nwindow and looked at it picking something off it with his fingers.",
    "What is it demanded M. Caux sharply.",
    "Four auburn hairs.",
    "He bent over the dead woman.",
    "Yes they are\nfrom the head of Madame.",
    "And what of it Do you attach importance to them\n\nPoirot let the rug drop back on the seat.",
    "What is important What is not One cannot say at this stage.",
    "But\nwe must note each little fact carefully.",
    "They went back again into the first compartment and in a minute\nor two the conductor of the carriage arrived to be questioned.",
    "Your name is Pierre Michel said the Commissary.",
    "Yes Monsieur le Commissaire.",
    "I should like you to repeat to this gentleman  he indicated Poirot\n the story that you told me as to what happened in Paris.",
    "Very good Monsieur le Commissaire.",
    "It was after we had left the\nGare de Lyon.",
    "I came along to make the beds thinking that\n\n\fMadame would be at dinner but she had a dinnerbasket in her\ncompartment.",
    "She said to me that she had been obliged to leave\nher maid behind in Paris so that I only need make up one berth.",
    "She took her dinnerbasket into the adjoining compartment and\nsat there while I made up the bed then she told me that she did\nnot wish to be wakened early in the morning that she liked to\nsleep on.",
    "I told her I quite understood and she wished me\ngoodnight.",
    "You yourself did not go into the adjoining compartment\n\nNo Monsieur.",
    "Then you did not happen to notice if a scarlet morocco case was\namongst the luggage there\n\nNo Monsieur I did not.",
    "Would it have been possible for a man to have been concealed in\nthe adjoining compartment\n\nThe conductor reflected.",
    "The door was half open he said.",
    "If a man had stood behind that\ndoor I should not have been able to see him but he would of\ncourse have been perfectly visible to Madame when she went in\nthere.",
    "Quite so said Poirot Is there anything more you have to tell\nus\n\n\fI think that is all Monsieur.",
    "I can remember nothing else.",
    "And now this morning prompted Poirot.",
    "As Madame had ordered I did not disturb her.",
    "It was not until just\nbefore Cannes that I ventured to knock at the door.",
    "Getting no\nreply I opened it.",
    "The lady appeared to be in her bed asleep.",
    "I\ntook her by the shoulder to rouse her and then \n\nAnd then you saw what had happened volunteered Poirot.",
    "Tr\u00e8s\nbien.",
    "I think I know all I want to know.",
    "I hope Monsieur le Commissaire it is not that I have been guilty\nof any negligence said the man piteously.",
    "Such an affair to\nhappen on the Blue Train It is horrible.",
    "Console yourself said the Commissary.",
    "Everything will be done\nto keep the affair as quiet as possible if only in the interests of\njustice.",
    "I cannot think you have been guilty of any negligence.",
    "And Monsieur le Commissaire will report as much to the\nCompany\n\nBut certainly but certainly said M. Caux impatiently.",
    "That will\ndo now.",
    "The conductor withdrew.",
    "According to the medical evidence said the Commissary the\nlady was probably dead before the train reached Lyons.",
    "Who then\nwas the murderer From Mademoiselles story it seems clear that\nsomewhere on her journey she was to meet this man of whom she\nspoke.",
    "Her action in getting rid of the maid seems significant.",
    "Did\nthe man join the train at Paris and did she conceal him in the\nadjoining compartment If so they may have quarrelled and he\nmay have killed her in a fit of rage.",
    "That is one possibility.",
    "The\nother and the more likely to my mind is that her assailant was a\ntrain robber travelling on the train that he stole along the corridor\nunseen by the conductor killed her and went off with the red\nmorocco case which doubtless contained jewels of some value.",
    "In\nall probability he left the train at Lyons and we have already\ntelegraphed to the station there for full particulars of anyone seen\nleaving the train.",
    "Or he might have come on to Nice suggested Poirot.",
    "He might agreed the Commissary but that would be a very\nbold course.",
    "Poirot let a minute or two go by before speaking and then he said\n\nIn the latter case you think the man was an ordinary train\nrobber\n\nThe Commissary shrugged his shoulders.",
    "It depends.",
    "We must get hold of the maid.",
    "It is possible that she\nhas the red morocco case with her.",
    "If so then the man of whom\n\n\fshe spoke to Mademoiselle may be concerned in the case and the\naffair is a crime of passion.",
    "I myself think the solution of a train\nrobber is the more probable.",
    "These bandits have become very\nbold of late.",
    "Poirot looked suddenly across to Katherine.",
    "And you Mademoiselle he said you heard and saw nothing\nduring the night\n\nNothing said Katherine.",
    "Poirot turned to the Commissary.",
    "We need detain Mademoiselle no longer I think he suggested.",
    "The latter nodded.",
    "She will leave us her address he said.",
    "Katherine gave him the name of Lady Tamplins villa.",
    "Poirot made\nher a little bow.",
    "You permit that I see you again Mademoiselle he said.",
    "Or\nhave you so many friends that your time will be all taken up\n\nOn the contrary said Katherine I shall have plenty of leisure\nand I shall be very pleased to see you again.",
    "Excellent said Poirot and gave her a little friendly nod.",
    "This\nshall be a Roman Policier a nous.",
    "We will investigate this affair\ntogether.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nAT THE VILLA MARGUERITE\n\nThen you were really in the thick of it all said Lady Tamplin\nenviously.",
    "My dear how thrilling She opened her china blue\neyes very wide and gave a little sigh.",
    "A real murder said Mr Evans gloatingly.",
    "Of course Chubby had no idea of anything of the kind went on\nLady Tamplin he simply could not imagine why the police wanted\nyou.",
    "My dear what an opportunity I think you know  yes I\ncertainly think something might be made out of this.",
    "A calculating look rather marred the ingenuousness of the blue\neyes.",
    "Katherine felt slightly uncomfortable.",
    "They were just finishing\nlunch and she looked in turn at the three people sitting round the\ntable.",
    "Lady Tamplin full of practical schemes Mr Evans beaming\nwith naive appreciation and Lenox with a queer crooked smile on\nher dark face.",
    "Marvellous luck murmured Chubby.",
    "I wish I could have gone\nalong with you  and seen  all the exhibits.",
    "His tone was wistful and childlike.",
    "Katherine said nothing.",
    "The police had laid no injunctions of\nsecrecy upon her and it was clearly impossible to suppress the\nbare facts or try to keep them from her hostess.",
    "But she did rather wish it had been possible to do so.",
    "Yes said Lady Tamplin coming suddenly out of her reverie I\ndo think something might be done.",
    "A little account you know\ncleverly written up.",
    "An eyewitness a feminine touch How I\nchatted with the dead woman little thinking  that sort of thing\nyou know.",
    "Rot said Lenox.",
    "You have no idea said Lady Tamplin in a soft wistful voice\nwhat newspapers will pay for a little titbit Written of course by\nsomeone of really unimpeachable social position.",
    "You would not\nlike to do it yourself I dare say Katherine dear but just give me\nthe bare bones of it and I will manage the whole thing for you.",
    "Mr\nde Haviland is a special friend of mine.",
    "We have a little\nunderstanding together.",
    "A most delightful man  not at all\nreporterish.",
    "How does the idea strike you Katherine\n\nI would much prefer to do nothing of the kind said Katherine\nbluntly.",
    "Lady Tamplin was rather disconcerted at this uncompromising\nrefusal.",
    "She sighed and turned to the elucidation of further details.",
    "A very strikinglooking woman you said I wonder now who she\ncould have been.",
    "You didnt hear her name\n\nIt was mentioned Katherine admitted but I cant remember it.",
    "You see I was rather upset.",
    "I should think so said Mr Evans it must have been a beastly\nshock.",
    "It is to be doubted whether even if Katherine had remembered the\nname she would have admitted the fact.",
    "Lady Tamplins\nremorseless crossexamination was making her restive.",
    "Lenox\nwho was observant in her own way noticed this and offered to\ntake Katherine upstairs to see her room.",
    "She left her there\nremarking kindly before she went You mustnt mind Mother she\nwould make a few pennies profit out of her dying grandmother if\nshe could.",
    "Lenox went down again to find her mother and her stepfather\ndiscussing the newcomer.",
    "Presentable said Lady Tamplin quite presentable.",
    "Her clothes\nare all right.",
    "That grey thing is the same model that Gladys Cooper\nwore in Palm Trees in Egypt \n\nHave you noticed her eyes  what interposed Mr Evans.",
    "Never mind her eyes Chubby said Lady Tamplin tartly we are\ndiscussing the things that really matter.",
    "Oh quite said Mr Evans and retired into his shell.",
    "She doesnt seem to me very  malleable said Lady Tamplin\nrather hesitating to choose the right word.",
    "She has all the instincts of a lady as they say in books said\nLenox with a grin.",
    "Narrowminded murmured Lady Tamplin.",
    "Inevitable under the\ncircumstances I suppose.",
    "I expect you will do your best to broaden her said Lenox with a\ngrin but you will have your work cut out.",
    "Just now you noticed\nshe stuck down her forefeet and laid back her ears and refused to\nbudge.",
    "Anyway said Lady Tamplin hopefully she doesnt look to me at\nall mean.",
    "Some people when they come into money seem to\nattach undue importance to it.",
    "Oh youll easily touch her for what you want said Lenox and\nafter all that is all that matters isnt it That is what she is here\nfor.",
    "She is my own cousin said Lady Tamplin with dignity.",
    "Cousin eh said Mr Evans waking up again.",
    "I suppose I call\nher Katherine dont I\n\nIt is of no importance at all what you call her Chubby said Lady\nTamplin.",
    "Good said Mr Evans then I will.",
    "Do you suppose she plays\ntennis he added hopefully.",
    "Of course not said Lady Tamplin.",
    "She has been a companion I\ntell you.",
    "Companions dont play tennis  or golf.",
    "They might\npossibly play golfcroquet but I have always understood that they\nwind wool and wash dogs most of the day.",
    "O God said Mr Evans do they really\n\nLenox drifted upstairs again to Katherines room.",
    "Can I help\nyou she asked rather perfunctorily.",
    "On Katherines disclaimer Lenox sat on the edge of the bed and\nstared thoughtfully at her guest.",
    "Why did you come she said at last.",
    "To us I mean.",
    "Were not\nyour sort.",
    "Oh I am anxious to get into Society.",
    "Dont be an ass said Lenox promptly detecting the flicker of a\nsmile.",
    "You know what I mean well enough.",
    "You are not a bit what I\nthought you would be.",
    "I say you have got some decent clothes.",
    "She sighed.",
    "Clothes are no good to me.",
    "I was born awkward.",
    "Its\na pity because I love them.",
    "I love them too said Katherine but it has not been much use\nmy loving them up to now.",
    "Do you think this is nice\n\nShe and Lenox discussed several models with artistic fervour.",
    "I like you said Lenox suddenly.",
    "I came up to warn you not to be\ntaken in by Mother but I think now that there is no need to do that.",
    "You are frightfully sincere and upright and all those queer things\nbut you are not a fool.",
    "Oh hell what is it now\n\nLady Tamplins voice was calling plaintively from the hall\n\nLenox Derek has just rung up.",
    "He wants to come to dinner\ntonight.",
    "Will it be all right I mean we havent got anything\nawkward like quails have we\n\nLenox reassured her and came back into Katherines room.",
    "Her\nface looked brighter and less sullen.",
    "Im glad old Derek is coming she said youll like him.",
    "Who is Derek\n\nHe is Lord Leconburys son married a rich American woman.",
    "Women are simply potty about him.",
    "Why\n\nOh the usual reason  very goodlooking and a regular bad lot.",
    "Everyone goes off their head about him.",
    "Do you\n\nSometimes I do said Lenox and sometimes I think I would like\nto marry a nice curate and live in the country and grow things in\nframes.",
    "She paused a minute and then added An Irish curate\nwould be best and then I should hunt.",
    "After a minute or two she reverted to her former theme.",
    "There is\nsomething queer about Derek.",
    "All that family are a bit potty  mad\ngamblers you know.",
    "In the old days they used to gamble away\ntheir wives and their estates and did most reckless things just for\nthe love of it.",
    "Derek would have made a perfect highwayman debonair and gay just the right manner.",
    "She moved to the door.",
    "Well come down when you like it.",
    "Left alone Katherine gave herself up to thought.",
    "Just at present\nshe felt thoroughly ill at ease and jarred by her surroundings.",
    "The shock of the discovery in the train and the reception of the\nnews by her new friends jarred upon her susceptibilities.",
    "She\nthought long and earnestly about the murdered woman.",
    "She had\nbeen sorry for Ruth but she could not honestly say that she had\nliked her.",
    "She had divined only too well the ruthless egoism that\nwas the keynote of her personality and it repelled her.",
    "She had been amused and a trifle hurt by the others cool\ndismissal of her when she had served her turn.",
    "That she had come\nto some decision Katherine was quite certain but she wondered\nnow what that decision had been.",
    "Whatever it was death had\nstepped in and made all decisions meaningless.",
    "Strange that it should have been so and that a brutal crime should\nhave been the ending of that fateful journey.",
    "But suddenly\nKatherine remembered a small fact that she ought perhaps to\nhave told the police  a fact that had for the moment escaped her\nmemory.",
    "Was it of any real importance She had certainly thought\nthat she had seen a man going into that particular compartment\nBut she realized that she might easily have been mistaken.",
    "It\nmight have been the compartment next door and certainly the\nman in question could be no train robber.",
    "She recalled him very\nclearly as she had seen him on those two previous occasions once at the Savoy and once at Cooks office.",
    "No doubtless she\nhad been mistaken.",
    "He had not gone into the dead womans\ncompartment and it was perhaps as well that she had said\nnothing to the police.",
    "She might have done incalculable harm by\ndoing so.",
    "She went down to join the others on the terrace outside.",
    "Through\nthe branches of mimosa she looked out over the blue of the\nMediterranean and whilst listening with half an ear to Lady\nTamplins chatter she was glad that she had come.",
    "This was\nbetter than St Mary Mead.",
    "That evening she put on the mauvy pink dress that went by the\nname of soupir dautomne and after smiling at her reflection in the\n\n\fmirror went downstairs with for the first time in her life a faint\nfeeling of shyness.",
    "Most of Lady Tamplins guests had arrived and since noise was\nthe essential of Lady Tamplins parties the din was already critic.",
    "Chubby rushed up to Katherine passed a cocktail upon her and\ntook her under his wing.",
    "Oh here you are Derek cried Lady Tamplin as the door\nopened to admit the last comer.",
    "Now at last we can have\nsomething to eat.",
    "I am starving.",
    "Katherine looked across the room.",
    "She was startled.",
    "So this  was\nDerek and she realized that she was not surprised.",
    "She had\nalways known that she would some day meet the man whom she\nhad seen three times by such a curious chain of coincidences.",
    "She thought too that he recognized her.",
    "He paused abruptly in\nwhat he was saying to Lady Tamplin and went on again as though\nwith an effort.",
    "They all went in to dinner and Katherine found that\nhe was placed beside her.",
    "He turned to her at once with a vivid\nsmile.",
    "I knew I was going to meet you soon he remarked but I never\ndreamt that it would be here.",
    "It had to be you know.",
    "Once at the\nSavoy and once at Cooks  never twice without three times.",
    "Dont\nsay you cant remember me or never noticed me.",
    "I insist upon your\npretending that you noticed me anyway.",
    "Oh I did said Katherine but this is not the third time.",
    "It is the\nfourth.",
    "I saw you on the Blue Train.",
    "On the Blue Train Something undefinable came over his\nmanner she could not have said just what it was.",
    "It was as though\nhe had received a check a setback.",
    "Then he said carelessly\n\nWhat was the rumpus this morning Somebody had died hadnt\nthey\n\nYes said Katherine slowly somebody had died.",
    "You shouldnt die on a train remarked Derek flippantly.",
    "I\nbelieve it causes all sorts of legal and international complications\nand it gives the train an excuse for being even later than usual.",
    "Mr Kettering A stout American lady who was sitting opposite\nleaned forward and spoke to him with the deliberate intonation of\nher race.",
    "Mr Kettering I do believe you have forgotten me and I\nthought you such a perfectly lovely man.",
    "Derek leaned forward answering her and Katherine sat almost\ndazed.",
    "Kettering That was the name of course  she remembered it now\n but what a strange ironical situation Here was this man whom\nshe had seen go into his wifes apartment last night who had left\nher safe and well and now he was sitting there quite unconscious\nof the fate that had befallen her.",
    "Of that there was no doubt.",
    "He\ndid not know.",
    "A servant was leaning over Derek handing him a note and\nmurmuring in his ear.",
    "With a word of excuse to Lady Tamplin he broke it open and an\nexpression of utter astonishment came over his face as he read\nthen he looked at his hostess.",
    "This is most extraordinary.",
    "I say Rosalie I am afraid I will have to\nleave you.",
    "The Prefect of Police wants to see me at once.",
    "I cant\nthink what about.",
    "Your sins have found you out remarked Lenox.",
    "They must have said Derek probably some idiotic nonsense\nbut I suppose I shall have to push off to the Prefecture.",
    "How dare\nthe old boy rout me out from dinner It ought to be something\ndeadly serious to justify that and he laughed as he pushed back\nhis chair and rose to leave the room.",
    "Chapter 13\n\nVAN ALDIN GETS A TELEGRAM\n\nOn the afternoon of the 15th February a thick yellow fog had\nsettled down on London.",
    "Rufus Van Aldin was in his suite at the Savoy and was making the\nmost of the atmospheric conditions by working double time.",
    "Knighton was overjoyed.",
    "He had found it difficult of late to get his\nemployer to concentrate on the matters in hand.",
    "When he had\nventured to urge certain courses Van Aldin had put him off with a\ncurt word.",
    "But now Van Aldin seemed to be throwing himself into\nwork with redoubled energy and the secretary made the most of\nhis\n\nopportunities.",
    "Always\n\ntactful\n\nhe\n\nplied\n\nthe\n\nspur\n\nso\n\nunobtrusively that Van Aldin never suspected it.",
    "Yet in the middle of this absorption in business matters one little\nfact lay at the back of Van Aldins mind.",
    "A chance remark of\nKnightons uttered by the secretary in all unconsciousness had\ngiven rise to it.",
    "It now festered unseen gradually reaching further\nand further forward into Van Aldins consciousness until at last in\nspite of himself he had to yield to its insistence.",
    "He listened to what Knighton was saying with his usual air of keen\nattention but in reality not one word of it penetrated his mind.",
    "He\nnodded automatically however and the secretary turned to some\nother paper.",
    "As he was sorting them out his employer spoke\n\nDo you mind telling me that over again Knighton\n\nFor a moment Knighton was at a loss.",
    "You mean about this sir He held up a closely written Company\nreport.",
    "No no said Van Aldin what you told me about seeing Ruths\nmaid in Paris last night.",
    "I cant make it out.",
    "You must have been\nmistaken.",
    "I cant have been mistaken sir I actually spoke to her.",
    "Well tell me the whole thing again.",
    "Knighton complied.",
    "I had fixed up the deal with Barthermers he explained and had\ngone back to the Ritz to pick up my traps preparatory to having\ndinner and catching the nine oclock train from the Gare du Nord.",
    "At the reception desk I saw a woman whom I was quite sure was\nMrs Ketterings maid.",
    "I went up to her and asked if Mrs Kettering\nwas staying there.",
    "Yes yes said Van Aldin.",
    "Of course.",
    "Naturally.",
    "And she told you\nthat Ruth had gone on to the Riviera and had sent her to the Ritz to\nawait further orders there\n\nExactly that sir.",
    "It is very odd said Van Aldin.",
    "Very odd indeed unless the\nwoman had been impertinent or something of that kind.",
    "In that case objected Knighton surely Mrs Kettering would\nhave paid her down a sum of money and told her to go back to\nEngland.",
    "She would hardly have sent her to the Ritz.",
    "No muttered the millionaire thats true.",
    "He was about to say something further but checked himself.",
    "He\nwas fond of Knighton and liked and trusted him but he could\nhardly discuss his daughters private affairs with his secretary.",
    "He\nhad already felt hurt by Ruths lack of frankness and this chance\nrevelation which had come to him did nothing to allay his\nmisgivings.",
    "Why had Ruth got rid of her maid in Paris What possible object or\nmotive could she have had in so doing\n\nHe reflected for a moment or two on the curious combination of\nchance.",
    "How should it have occurred to Ruth except as the\nwildest coincidence that the first person that the maid should run\nacross in Paris should be her fathers secretary Ah but that was\nthe way things happened.",
    "That was the way things got found out.",
    "He winced at the last phrase it had arisen with complete\nnaturalness to his mind.",
    "Was there then something to be found\nout He hated to put this question to himself he had no doubt of\nthe answer.",
    "The answer was  he was sure of it  Armand de la\nRoche.",
    "It was bitter to Van Aldin that a daughter of his should be gulled by\nsuch a man yet he was forced to admit that she was in good\ncompany  that other wellbred and intelligent women had\nsuccumbed just as easily to the Counts fascination.",
    "Men saw\nthrough him women did not.",
    "He sought now for a phrase that would allay any suspicion that his\nsecretary might have felt.",
    "Ruth is always changing her mind about things at a moments\nnotice he remarked and then he added in a wouldbe careless\ntone The maid didnt give any  er  reason for this change of\nplan\n\nKnighton was careful to make his voice as natural as possible as\nhe replied\n\nShe said sir that Mrs Kettering had met a friend unexpectedly.",
    "Is that so\n\nThe secretarys practised ears caught the note of strain\nunderlying the seemingly casual tone.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Man or woman\n\nI think she said a man sir.",
    "Van Aldin nodded.",

    "Ruth said Van Aldin hoarsely.",

    "I can only say call upon me at any\ntime and you will not find me ungrateful.",
    "And now gentlemen to\nbusiness.",
    "I propose said M. Carrege to interrogate the maid Ada\nMason.",
    "You have her here I understand\n\nYes said Van Aldin.",
    "We picked her up in Paris in passing\nthrough.",
    "She was very upset to hear of her mistresss death but\nshe tells her story coherently enough.",
    "We will have her in then said M. Carrege.",
    "He rang the bell on his desk and in a few minutes Ada Mason\nentered the room.",
    "She was very neatly dressed in black and the tip of her nose was\nred.",
    "She had exchanged her grey travelling gloves for a pair of\nblack suede ones.",
    "She cast a look round the Examining\nMagistrates office in some trepidation and seemed relieved at\nthe presence of her mistresss father.",
    "The Examining Magistrate\nprided himself on his geniality of manner and did his best to put\nher at her ease.",
    "He was helped in this by Poirot who acted as\ninterpreter and whose friendly manner was reassuring to the\nEnglishman.",
    "Your name is Ada Mason is that right\n\nAda Beatrice I was christened sir said Mason primly.",
    "Just so.",
    "And we can understand Mason that this has all been\nvery distressing.",
    "Oh indeed it has sir.",
    "I have been with many ladies and always\ngiven satisfaction I hope and I never dreamt of anything of this\nkind happening in any situation where I was.",
    "No no said M. Carrege.",
    "Naturally I have read of such things of course in the Sunday\npapers.",
    "And then I always have understood that those foreign\ntrains  She suddenly checked her flow remembering that the\n\n\fgentlemen who were speaking to her were of the same nationality\nas the trains.",
    "Now let us talk this affair over said M. Carrege.",
    "There was I\nunderstand no question of your staying in Paris when you started\nfrom London\n\nOh no sir.",
    "We were to go straight through to Nice.",
    "Have you ever been abroad with your mistress before\n\nNo sir.",
    "I had only been with her two months you see.",
    "Did she seem quite as usual when starting on this journey\n\nShe was worried like and a bit upset and she was rather irritable\nand difficult to please.",
    "M. Carrege nodded.",
    "Now then Mason what was the first you heard of your stopping\nin Paris\n\nIt was at the place they call the Gare de Lyon sir.",
    "My mistress\nwas thinking of getting out and walking up and down the platform.",
    "She was just going out into the corridor when she gave a sudden\nexclamation and came back into her compartment with a\ngentleman.",
    "She shut the door between her carriage and mine so\nthat I didnt see or hear anything till she suddenly opened it again\nand told me that she had changed her plans.",
    "She gave me some\n\n\fmoney and told me to get out and go to the Ritz.",
    "They knew her\nwell there she said and would give me a room.",
    "I was to wait there\nuntil I heard from her she would wire me what she wanted me to\ndo.",
    "I had just time to get my things together and jump out of the\ntrain before it started off.",
    "It was a rush.",
    "While Mrs Kettering was telling you this where was the\ngentleman\n\nHe was standing in the other compartment sir looking out of the\nwindow.",
    "Can you describe him to us\n\nWell you see sir I hardly saw him.",
    "He had his back to me most of\nthe time.",
    "He was a tall gentleman and dark thats all I can say.",
    "He\nwas dressed very like any other gentleman in a dark blue overcoat\nand a grey hat.",
    "Was he one of the passengers on the train\n\nI dont think so sir I took it that he had come to the station to see\nMrs Kettering in passing through.",
    "Of course he might have been\none of the passengers I never thought of that.",
    "Mason seemed a little flurried by the suggestion.",
    "Ah M. Carrege passed lightly to another subject.",
    "Your mistress\nlater requested the conductor not to rouse her early in the\nmorning.",
    "Was that a likely thing for her to do do you think\n\n\fOh yes sir.",
    "The mistress never ate any breakfast and she didnt\nsleep well at nights so that she liked sleeping on in the morning.",
    "Again M. Carrege passed to another subject.",
    "Amongst the luggage there was a scarlet morocco case was\nthere not he asked.",
    "Your mistresss jewelcase\n\nYes sir.",
    "Did you take that case to the Ritz\n\nMe take the mistresss jewelcase to the Ritz Oh no indeed sir.",
    "Masons tones were horrified.",
    "You left it behind you in the carriage\n\nYes sir.",
    "Had your mistress many jewels with her do you know\n\nA fair amount sir made me a bit uneasy sometimes I can tell\nyou with those nasty tales you hear of being robbed in foreign\ncountries.",
    "They were insured I know but all the same it seemed a\nfrightful risk.",
    "Why the rubies alone the mistress told me were\nworth several hundred thousand pounds.",
    "The rubies What rubies barked Van Aldin suddenly.",
    "Mason turned to him.",
    "I think it was you who gave them to her sir not very long ago.",
    "My God cried Van Aldin.",
    "You dont imply she had those rubies\nwith her I told her to leave them at the Bank.",
    "Mason gave once more the discreet cough which was apparently\npart of her stockintrade as a ladys maid.",
    "This time it expressed a\ngood deal.",
    "It expressed far more clearly than words could have\ndone that Masons mistress had been a lady who took her own\nway.",
    "Ruth must have been mad muttered Van Aldin.",
    "What on earth\ncould have possessed her\n\nM. Carrege in turn gave vent to a cough again a cough of\nsignificance.",
    "It riveted Van Aldins attention on him.",
    "For the moment said M. Carrege addressing Mason I think\nthat is all.",
    "If you will go into the next room Mademoiselle they will\nread over to you the questions and answers and you will sign\naccordingly.",
    "Mason went out escorted by the clerk and Van Aldin said\nimmediately to the Magistrate\n\nWell\n\n\fM. Carrege opened a drawer in his desk took out a letter and\nhanded it across to Van Aldin.",
    "This was found in Madames handbag.",
    "Ch\u00e8re amie the letter ran\nI will obey you I will be prudent discreet  all those things that a\nlover most hates.",
    "Paris would perhaps have been unwise but the\nIsles dOr are far away from the world and you may be assured\nthat nothing will leak out.",
    "It is like you and your divine sympathy to\nbe so interested in the work on famous jewels that I am writing.",
    "It\nwill indeed be an extraordinary privilege to actually see and\nhandle these historic rubies.",
    "I am devoting a special passage to\nHeart of Fire.",
    "My wonderful one Soon I will make up to you for all\nthose sad years of separation and emptiness.",
    "Your everadoring\nArmand.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nTHE COMTE DE LA ROCHE\n\nVan Aldin read the letter through in silence.",
    "His face turned a dull\nangry crimson.",
    "The men watching him saw the veins start out on\nhis forehead and his big hands clench themselves unconsciously.",
    "He handed back the letter without a word.",
    "M. Carrege was looking\nwith close attention at his desk M. Cauxs eyes were fixed upon\n\n\fthe ceiling and M. Hercule Poirot was tenderly brushing a speck\nof dust from his coat sleeve.",
    "With the greatest tact they none of\nthem looked at Van Aldin.",
    "It was M. Carrege mindful of his status and his duties who\ntackled the unpleasant subject.",
    "Perhaps Monsieur he murmured you are aware by whom  er this letter was written\n\nYes I know said Van Aldin heavily.",
    "Ah said the Magistrate inquiringly.",
    "A scoundrel who calls himself the Comte de la Roche.",
    "There was a pause then M. Poirot leaned forward straightened a\nruler on the judges desk and addressed the millionaire directly.",
    "M. Van Aldin we are all sensible deeply sensible of the pain it\nmust give you to speak of these matters but believe me\nMonsieur it is not the time for concealments.",
    "If justice is to be\ndone we must know everything.",
    "If you will reflect a little minute\nyou will realize the truth of that clearly for yourself.",
    "Van Aldin was silent for a moment or two then almost reluctantly\nhe nodded his head in agreement.",
    "You are quite right M. Poirot he said.",
    "Painful as it is I have no\nright to keep anything back.",
    "The Commissary gave a sigh of relief and the Examining\nMagistrate leaned back in his chair and adjusted a pincenez on\nhis long thin nose.",
    "Perhaps you will tell us in your own words M. Van Aldin he said\nall that you know of this gentleman.",
    "It began eleven or twelve years ago  in Paris.",
    "My daughter was a\nyoung girl then and of foolish romantic notions like all young\ngirls are.",
    "Unknown to me she made the acquaintance of this\nComte de la Roche.",
    "You have heard of him perhaps\n\nThe Commissary and Poirot nodded in assent.",
    "He calls himself the Comte de la Roche continued Van Aldin\nbut I doubt if he has any right to the title.",
    "You would not have found his name in the Almanac de Gotha\nagreed the Commissary.",
    "I discovered as much said Van Aldin.",
    "The man was a goodlooking plausible scoundrel with a fatal fascination for women.",
    "Ruth was infatuated with him but I soon put a stop to the whole\naffair.",
    "The man was no better than a common swindler.",
    "You are quite right said the Commissary.",
    "The Comte de la\nRoche is well known to us.",
    "If it were possible we should have laid\nhim by the heels before now but to foil  it is not easy the fellow is\ncunning his affairs are always conducted with ladies of high\n\n\fsocial position.",
    "If he obtains money from them under false\npretences or as the fruit of blackmail eh bien naturally they will\nnot prosecute.",
    "To look foolish in the eyes of the world oh no that\nwould never do and he has an extraordinary power over women.",
    "That is so said the millionaire heavily.",
    "Well as I told you I\nbroke the affair up pretty sharply.",
    "I told Ruth exactly what he was\nand she had perforce to believe me.",
    "About a year afterwards\nshe met her present husband and married him.",
    "As far as I knew\nthat was the end of the matter but only a week ago I discovered\nto\n\nmy\n\namazement\n\nthat\n\nmy\n\ndaughter\n\nhad\n\nresumed\n\nher\n\nacquaintance with the Comte de la Roche.",
    "She had been meeting\nhim frequently in London and Paris.",
    "I remonstrated with her on her\nimprudence for I may tell you gentlemen that on my insistence\nshe was preparing to bring a suit for divorce against her\nhusband.",
    "That is interesting murmured Poirot softly his eyes on the\nceiling.",
    "Van Aldin looked at him sharply and then went on.",
    "I pointed out to her the folly of continuing to see the Comte under\nthe circumstances.",
    "I thought she agreed with me.",
    "The Examining Magistrate coughed delicately.",
    "But according to this letter  he began and then stopped.",
    "Van Aldins jaw set itself squarely.",
    "I know.",
    "Its no good mincing matters.",
    "However unpleasant we\nhave got to face facts.",
    "It seems clear that Ruth had arranged to go\nto Paris and meet de la Roche there.",
    "After my warnings to her\nhowever she must have written to the Count suggesting a change\nof rendezvous.",
    "The Isles dOr said the Commissary thoughtfully are situated\njust opposite Hyeres a remote and idyllic spot.",
    "Van Aldin nodded.",
    "My God How could Ruth be such a fool he exclaimed bitterly.",
    "All this talk about writing a book on jewels Why he must have\nbeen after the rubies from the first.",
    "There are some very famous rubies said Poirot originally part\nof the Crown jewels of Russia they are unique in character and\ntheir value is almost fabulous.",
    "There has been a rumour that they\nhave lately passed into the possession of an American.",
    "Are we\nright in concluding Monsieur that you were the purchaser\n\nYes said Van Aldin.",
    "They came into my possession in Paris\nabout ten days ago.",
    "Pardon me Monsieur but you have been negotiating for their\npurchase for some time\n\nA little over two months.",
    "Why\n\n\fThese things become known said Poirot.",
    "There is always a\npretty formidable crowd on the track of jewels such as these.",
    "A spasm distorted the others face.",
    "I remember he said brokenly a joke I made to Ruth when I\ngave them to her.",
    "I told her not to take them to the Riviera with\nher as I could not afford to have her robbed and murdered for the\nsake of the jewels.",
    "My God the things one says  never dreaming\nor knowing they will come true.",
    "There was a sympathetic silence and then Poirot spoke in a\ndetached manner.",
    "Let us arrange our facts with order and precision.",
    "According to\nour present theory this is how they run.",
    "The Comte de la Roche\nknows of your purchase of these jewels.",
    "By an easy stratagem he\ninduces Madame Kettering to bring the stones with her.",
    "He then\nis the man Mason saw in the train at Paris.",
    "The other three nodded in agreement.",
    "Madame is surprised to see him but she deals with the situation\npromptly.",
    "Mason is got out of the way a dinner basket is ordered.",
    "We know from the conductor that he made up the berth for the\nfirst compartment that\n\nhe\n\ndid\n\nnot\n\ngo\n\ninto\n\nthe\n\nsecond\n\ncompartment and that a man could quite well have been\nconcealed from him.",
    "So far the Comte would have been hidden to\na marvel.",
    "No one knows of his presence on the train except\n\n\fMadame he has been careful that the maid did not see his face.",
    "All that she could say is that he was tall and dark.",
    "It is all most\nconveniently vague.",
    "They are alone  and the train rushes through\nthe night.",
    "There would be no outcry no struggle for the man is so\nshe thinks her lover.",
    "He turned gently to Van Aldin.",
    "Death Monsieur must have been almost instantaneous.",
    "We will\npass over that quickly.",
    "The Comte takes the jewelcase which lies\nready to his hand.",
    "Shortly afterwards the train draws into Lyons.",
    "M. Carrege nodded his approval.",
    "Precisely.",
    "The conductor descends.",
    "It would be easy for our man\nto leave the train unseen it would be easy to catch a train back to\nParis or anywhere he pleases.",
    "And the crime would be put down\nas an ordinary train robbery.",
    "But for the letter found in Madames\nbag the Comte would not have been mentioned.",
    "It was an oversight on his part not to search that bag declared\nthe Commissary.",
    "Without doubt he thought she had destroyed that letter.",
    "It was pardon me Monsieur  it was an indiscretion of the first water to\nkeep it.",
    "And yet murmured Poirot it was an indiscretion the Comte\nmight have foreseen.",
    "You mean\n\nI mean we are all agreed on one point and that is that the Comte\nde la Roche knows one subject \u00e0 fond Women.",
    "How was it that\nknowing women as he does he did not foresee that Madame\nwould have kept that letter\n\nYes  yes said the Examining Magistrate doubtfully there is\nsomething in what you say.",
    "But at such times you understand a\nman is not master of himself.",
    "He does not reason calmly.",
    "Mon\nDieu he added with feeling if our criminals kept their heads\nand acted with intelligence how should we capture them\n\nPoirot smiled to himself.",
    "It seems to me a clear case said the other but a difficult one to\nprove.",
    "He is a slippery customer and unless the maid can identify\nhim \n\nWhich is most unlikely said Poirot.",
    "True true.",
    "The Examining Magistrate rubbed his chin.",
    "It is\ngoing to be difficult.",
    "If he did indeed commit the crime  began Poirot.",
    "M. Caux\ninterrupted.",
    "If  you say if\n\nYes Monsieur le Juge I say if.",
    "The other looked at him sharply.",
    "You are right he said at last\nwe go too fast.",
    "It is possible that the Comte may have an alibi.",
    "Then we should look foolish.",
    "Ah \u00e7a par exemple replied Poirot that is of no importance\nwhatever.",
    "Naturally if he committed the crime he will have an\nalibi.",
    "A man with the Comtes experience does not neglect to take\nprecautions.",
    "No I said if for a very different reason.",
    "And what was that\n\nPoirot wagged an emphatic forefinger.",
    "The psychology.",
    "Eh said the Commissary.",
    "The psychology is at fault.",
    "The Comte is a scoundrel  yes.",
    "The\nComte is a swindler  yes.",
    "The Comte preys upon women  yes.",
    "He\nproposes to steal Madames jewels  again yes.",
    "Is he the kind of\nman to commit murder I say no A man of the type of the Comte is\nalways a coward he takes no risks.",
    "He plays the safe the mean\nwhat the English call the lowdown game but murder a hundred\ntimes no He shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.",
    "The Examining Magistrate however did not seem disposed to\nagree with him.",
    "The day always comes when such gentry lose their heads and go\ntoo far he observed sagely.",
    "Doubtless that is the case here.",
    "Without wishing to disagree with you M. Poirot \n\nIt was only an opinion Poirot hastened to explain.",
    "The case is\nof course in your hands and you will do what seems fit to you.",
    "I am satisfied in my own mind that the Comte de la Roche is the\nman we need to get hold of said M. Carrege.",
    "You agree with me\nMonsieur le Commissaire\n\nPerfectly.",
    "And you M. Van Aldin\n\nYes said the millionaire.",
    "Yes the man is a thoroughpaced\nvillain no doubt about it.",
    "It will be difficult to lay hands on him I am afraid said the\nMagistrate but we shall do our best.",
    "Telegraphed instructions\nshall go out at once.",
    "Permit me to assist you said Poirot.",
    "There need be no\ndifficulty.",
    "Eh\n\nThe others stared at him.",
    "The little man smiled beamingly back at\nthem.",
    "It is my business to know things.",
    "he explained.",
    "The Comte is a\nman of intelligence.",
    "He is at present at a villa he has leased the\nVilla Marina at Antibes.",
    "Chapter 16\n\nPOIROT DISCUSSES THE CASE\n\nEverybody looked respectfully at Poirot.",
    "Undoubtedly the little man had scored heavily.",
    "The Commissary\nlaughed  on a rather hollow note.",
    "You teach us all our business he cried.",
    "M. Poirot knows more\nthan the police.",
    "Poirot gazed complacently at the ceiling adopting a mockmodest\nair.",
    "What will you it is my little hobby he murmured to know\nthings.",
    "Naturally I have the time to indulge it.",
    "I am not\noverburdened with affairs.",
    "Ah said the Commissary shaking his head portentously.",
    "As for\nme \n\nHe made an exaggerated gesture to represent the cares that lay\non his shoulders.",
    "Poirot turned suddenly to Van Aldin.",
    "You agree Monsieur with this view You feel certain that the\nComte de la Roche is the murderer\n\nWhy it would seem so  yes certain.",
    "Something guarded in the answer made the Examining Magistrate\nlook at the American curiously.",
    "Van Aldin seemed aware of his\nscrutiny and made an effort as though to shake off some\npreoccupation.",
    "What about my soninlaw he asked.",
    "You have acquainted him\nwith the news He is in Nice I understand.",
    "Certainly Monsieur.",
    "The Commissary hesitated and then\nmurmured very discreetly\n\nYou are doubtless aware M. Van Aldin that M. Kettering was\nalso one of the passengers on the Blue Train that night\n\nThe millionaire nodded.",
    "Heard it just before I left London he vouchsafed laconically.",
    "He tells us continued the Commissary that he had no idea his\nwife was travelling on the train.",
    "I bet he hadnt said Van Aldin grimly.",
    "It would have been rather\na nasty shock to him if hed come across her on it.",
    "The three men looked at him questioningly.",
    "Im not going to mince matters said Van Aldin savagely.",
    "No one\nknows what my poor girl has had to put up with.",
    "Derek Kettering\nwasnt alone.",
    "He had a lady with him.",
    "Ah\n\nMirelle  the dancer.",
    "M. Carrege and the Commissary looked at each other and nodded\nas though confirming some previous conversation.",
    "M. Carrege\nleaned back in his chair joined his hands and fixed his eyes on\nthe ceiling.",
    "Ah he murmured again.",
    "One wondered.",
    "He coughed.",
    "One has heard rumours.",
    "The lady said M. Caux is very notorious.",
    "And also murmured Poirot softly very expensive.",
    "Van Aldin had gone very red in the face.",
    "He leant forward and hit the table a bang with his fist.",
    "See here he cried my soninlaw is a damned scoundrel\n\nHe glared at them looking from one face to another.",
    "Oh I know he went on.",
    "Good looks and a charming easy\nmanner.",
    "It took me in once upon a time.",
    "I suppose he pretended to\nbe brokenhearted when you broke the news to him  that is if he\ndidnt know it already.",
    "Oh it\n\ncame\n\nas\n\na\n\ncomplete\n\nsurprise to\n\nhim.",
    "He\n\nwas\n\noverwhelmed.",
    "Darned young hypocrite said Van Aldin.",
    "Simulated great grief\nI suppose\n\nNno said the Commissary cautiously.",
    "I would not quite say\nthat  eh M. Carrege\n\nThe Magistrate brought the tips of his fingers together and half\nclosed his eyes.",
    "Shock bewilderment horror  these things yes he declared\njudicially.",
    "Great sorrow  no  I should not say that.",
    "Hercule Poirot spoke once more.",
    "Permit me to ask M. Van Aldin does M. Kettering benefit by the\ndeath of his wife\n\nHe benefits to the tune of a couple of millions said Van Aldin.",
    "Dollars\n\nPounds.",
    "I settled that sum on Ruth absolutely on her marriage.",
    "She made no will and leaves no children so the money will go to\nher husband.",
    "Whom she was on the point of divorcing murmured Poirot.",
    "Ah\nyes  pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment.",
    "The Commissary turned and looked sharply at him.",
    "Do you mean  he began.",
    "I mean nothing said Poirot.",
    "I arrange the facts that is all.",
    "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest.",
    "The little man rose to his feet.",
    "I do not think I can be of any further service to you M. le Juge\nhe said politely bowing to M. Carrege.",
    "You will keep me informed\nof the course of events It will be a kindness.",
    "But certainly  most certainly.",
    "Van Aldin rose also.",
    "You dont want me any more at present\n\n\fNo Monsieur we have all the information we need for the\nmoment.",
    "Then I will walk a little way with M. Poirot.",
    "That is if he does not\nobject\n\nEnchanted Monsieur said the little man with a bow.",
    "Van Aldin lighted a large cigar having offered one to Poirot who\ndeclined it and lit one of his own tiny cigarettes.",
    "A man of great\nstrength of character Van Aldin already appeared to be his\neveryday normal self once more.",
    "After strolling along for a minute\nor two in silence the millionaire spoke\n\nI take it M. Poirot that you no longer exercise your profession\n\nThat is so Monsieur.",
    "I enjoy the world.",
    "Yet you are assisting the police in this affair\n\nMonsieur if a doctor walks along the street and an accident\nhappens does he say I have retired from my profession I will\ncontinue my walk when there is someone bleeding to death at his\nfeet If I had been already in Nice and the police had sent to me\nand asked me to assist them I should have refused.",
    "But this affair\nthe good God thrust it upon me.",
    "You were on the spot said Van Aldin thoughtfully.",
    "You\nexamined the compartment did you not\n\n\fPoirot nodded.",
    "Doubtless you found things that were shall we say suggestive to\nyou\n\nPerhaps said Poirot.",
    "I hope you see what I am leading up to said Van Aldin.",
    "It\nseems to me that the case against this Comte de la Roche is\nperfectly clear but I am not a fool.",
    "I have been watching you for\nthis last hour or so and I realise that for some reason of your own\nyou dont agree with that theory\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I may be wrong.",
    "So we come to the favour I want to ask you.",
    "Will you act in this\nmatter for me\n\nFor you personally\n\nThat was my meaning.",
    "Poirot was silent for a moment or two.",
    "Then he said\n\nYou realize what you are asking\n\n\fI guess so said Van Aldin.",
    "Very well said Poirot.",
    "I accept.",
    "But in that case I must have\nfrank answers to my questions.",
    "Why certainly.",
    "That is understood.",
    "Poirots manner changed.",
    "He became suddenly brusque and\nbusinesslike.",
    "This question of a divorce he said.",
    "It was you who advised your\ndaughter to bring the suit\n\nYes.",
    "When\n\nAbout ten days ago.",
    "I had had a letter from her complaining of\nher husbands behaviour and I put it to her very strongly that\ndivorce was the only remedy.",
    "In what way did she complain of his behaviour\n\nHe was being seen about with a very notorious lady  the one we\nhave been speaking of  Mirelle.",
    "The dancer.",
    "Ahha And Madame Kettering objected Was she\nvery devoted to her husband\n\nI would not say that said Van Aldin hesitating a little.",
    "It was not her heart that suffered it was her pride  is that what\nyou would say\n\nYes I suppose you might put it like that.",
    "I gather that the marriage had not been a happy one from the\nbeginning\n\nDerek Kettering is rotten to the core said Van Aldin.",
    "He is\nincapable of making any woman happy.",
    "He is as you say in England a bad lot.",
    "That is right is it not\n\nVan Aldin nodded.",
    "Tr\u00e8s bien You advise Madame to seek a divorce she agrees you\nconsult your solicitors.",
    "When does M. Kettering get news of what\nis in the wind\n\nI sent for him myself and explained the course of action I\nproposed to take.",
    "And what did he say murmured Poirot softly.",
    "Van Aldins face darkened at the remembrance.",
    "He was infernally impudent.",
    "Excuse the question Monsieur but did he refer himself to le\nComte de la Roche\n\nNot by name growled the other unwillingly but he showed\nhimself cognizant of the affair.",
    "What if I may ask was M. Ketterings financial position at the\ntime\n\nHow do you suppose I should know that asked Van Aldin after\na very brief hesitation.",
    "It seemed likely to me that you would inform yourself on that\npoint.",
    "Well  you are quite right I did.",
    "I discovered that Kettering was on\nthe rocks.",
    "And now he has inherited two million pounds Ma foi  it is a\nstrange thing is it not\n\nVan Aldin looked at him sharply.",
    "What do you mean\n\nI moralize said Poirot.",
    "I reflect I speak the philosophy.",
    "But to\nreturn to where we were.",
    "Surely M. Kettering did not propose to\nallow himself to be divorced without making a fight for it\n\nVan Aldin did not answer for a minute or two then he said\n\n\fI dont exactly know what his intentions were.",
    "Did you hold any further communications with him\n\nAgain a slight pause then Van Aldin said No.",
    "Poirot stopped dead took off his hat and held out his hand.",
    "I must wish you goodday Monsieur.",
    "I can do nothing for you.",
    "What are you getting at demanded Van Aldin angrily.",
    "If you do not tell me the truth I can do nothing.",
    "I dont know what you mean.",
    "I think you do.",
    "You may rest assured M. Van Aldin that I know\nhow to be discreet.",
    "Very well then said the millionaire.",
    "Ill admit that I was not\nspeaking the truth just now.",
    "I did have further communication with\nmy soninlaw.",
    "Yes\n\nTo be exact I sent my secretary Major Knighton to see him with\ninstructions to offer him the sum of one hundred thousand pounds\nin cash if the divorce went through undefended.",
    "A pretty sum of money said Poirot appreciatively and the\nanswer of Monsieur your soninlaw\n\nHe sent back word that I could go to hell replied the millionaire\nsuccinctly.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "He betrayed no emotion of any kind.",
    "At the moment he was\nengaged in methodically recording facts.",
    "Monsieur Kettering has told the police that he neither saw nor\nspoke to his wife on the journey from England.",
    "Are you inclined to\nbelieve that statement Monsieur\n\nYes I am said Van Aldin.",
    "He would take particular pains to\nkeep out of her way I should say.",
    "Why\n\nBecause he had got that woman with him.",
    "Mirelle\n\nYes.",
    "How did you come to know that fact\n\nA man of mine whom I had put on to watch him reported to me\nthat they had both left by that train.",
    "I see said Poirot.",
    "In that case as you said before he would not\nbe likely to attempt to hold any communication with Madame\nKettering.",
    "The little man fell silent for some time.",
    "Van Aldin did not interrupt his meditation.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nAN ARISTOCRATIC GENTLEMAN\n\nYou have been to the Riviera before Georges said Poirot to his\nvalet the following morning.",
    "George was an intensely English rather woodenfaced individual.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "I was here two years ago when I was in the service of\nLord Edward Frampton.",
    "And today murmured his master you are here with Hercule\nPoirot.",
    "How one mounts in the world\n\nThe valet made no reply to this observation.",
    "After a suitable pause\nhe asked\n\nThe brown lounge suit sir The wind is somewhat chilly today.",
    "There is a grease spot on the waistcoat objected Poirot.",
    "A\nmorceau of Filet de sole a la Jeanette alighted there when I was\nlunching at the Ritz last Tuesday.",
    "There is no spot there now sir said George reproachfully.",
    "I\nhave removed it.",
    "Tr\u00e8s bien said Poirot.",
    "I am pleased with you Georges.",
    "Thank you sir.",
    "There was a pause and then Poirot murmured dreamily\n\nSupposing my good Georges that you had been born in the\nsame social sphere as your late master Lord Edward Frampton that penniless yourself you had married an extremely wealthy\nwife but that that wife proposed to divorce you with excellent\nreasons what would you do about it\n\nI should endeavour sir replied George to make her change\nher mind.",
    "By peaceful or by forcible methods\n\nGeorge looked shocked.",
    "You will excuse me sir he said but a gentleman of the\naristocracy would not behave like a Whitechapel coster.",
    "He would\nnot do anything low.",
    "Would he not Georges I wonder now Perhaps you are right.",
    "There was a knock on the door.",
    "George went to it and opened it a\ndiscreet inch or two.",
    "A low murmured colloquy went on and then\nthe valet returned to Poirot.",
    "A note sir.",
    "Poirot took it.",
    "It was from M. Caux the Commissary of Police.",
    "We are about to interrogate the Comte de la Roche.",
    "The Juge\ndInstruction begs that you will be present.",
    "Quickly my suit Georges.",
    "I must hasten myself.",
    "A quarter of an hour later spick and span in his brown suit Poirot\nentered the Examining Magistrates room.",
    "M. Caux was already\nthere and both he and M. Carrege greeted Poirot with polite\nempressement.",
    "The affair is somewhat discouraging murmured M. Caux.",
    "It appears that the Comte arrived in Nice the day before the\nmurder.",
    "If that is true it will settle your affair nicely for you responded\nPoirot.",
    "M. Carrege cleared his throat.",
    "We must not accept this alibi without very cautious inquiry he\ndeclared.",
    "He struck the bell upon the table with his hand.",
    "In\nanother minute a tall dark man exquisitely dressed with a\nsomewhat haughty cast of countenance entered the room.",
    "So\nvery aristocraticlooking was the Count that it would have\nseemed sheer heresy even to whisper that his father had been an\nobscure cornchandler in Nantes  which as a matter of fact was\nthe case.",
    "Looking at him one would have been prepared to swear\nthat innumerable ancestors of his must have perished by the\nguillotine in the French Revolution.",
    "I am here gentlemen said the Count haughtily.",
    "May I ask why\nyou wish to see me\n\nPray be seated Monsieur le Comte said the Examining\nMagistrate politely.",
    "It is the affair of the death of Madame\nKettering that we are investigating.",
    "The death of Madame Kettering I do not understand.",
    "You were  ahem  acquainted with the lady I believe Monsieur\nle Comte\n\nCertainly I was acquainted with her.",
    "What has that to do with the\nmatter\n\nSticking an eyeglass in his eye he looked coldly round the room\nhis glance resting longest on Poirot who was gazing at him with a\nkind of simple innocent admiration which was most pleasing to\n\n\fthe Counts vanity.",
    "M. Carrege leaned back in his chair and\ncleared his throat.",
    "You do not perhaps know Monsieur le Comte  he paused  that\nMadame Kettering was murdered\n\nMurdered Mon Dieu how terrible\n\nThe surprise and the sorrow were excellently done  so well done\nindeed as to seem wholly natural.",
    "Madame Kettering was strangled between Paris and Lyons\ncontinued M. Carrege and her jewels were stolen.",
    "It is iniquitous cried the Count warmly the police should do\nsomething about these train bandits.",
    "Nowadays no one is safe.",
    "In Madames handbag continued the Judge we found a letter\nto her from you.",
    "She had it seemed arranged to meet you\n\nThe Count shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands.",
    "Of what use are concealments he said frankly.",
    "We are all men\nof the world.",
    "Privately and between ourselves I admit the affair.",
    "You met her in Paris and travelled down with her I believe said\nM. Carrege.",
    "That was the original arrangement but by Madames wish it was\nchanged.",
    "I was to meet her at Hyeres.",
    "You did not meet her on the train at the Gare de Lyon on the\nevening of the 14th\n\nOn the contrary I arrived in Nice on the morning of that day so\nwhat you suggest is impossible.",
    "Quite so quite so said M. Carrege.",
    "As a matter of fact you\nwould perhaps give me an account of your movements during the\nevening and night of the 14th.",
    "The Count reflected for a minute.",
    "I dined in Monte Carlo at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris.",
    "Afterwards I went to\nthe Le Sporting.",
    "I won a few thousand francs he shrugged his\nshoulders.",
    "I returned home at perhaps one oclock.",
    "Pardon me Monsieur but how did you return home\n\nIn my own twoseater car.",
    "No one was with you\n\nNo one.",
    "You could produce witnesses in support of this statement\n\nDoubtless many of my friends saw me there that evening.",
    "I dined\nalone.",
    "Your servant admitted you on your return to your villa\n\nI let myself in with my own latchkey.",
    "Ah murmured the Magistrate.",
    "Again he struck the bell on the table with his hand.",
    "The door\nopened and a messenger appeared.",
    "Bring in the maid Mason said M. Carrege.",
    "Very good Monsieur le Juge.",
    "Ada Mason was brought in.",
    "Will you be so good Mademoiselle as to look at this gentleman.",
    "To the best of your ability was it he who entered your mistresss\ncompartment in Paris\n\nThe woman looked long and searchingly at the Count who was\nPoirot fancied rather uneasy under this scrutiny.",
    "I could not say sir I am sure said Mason at last.",
    "It might be\nand again it might not.",
    "Seeing as how I only saw his back its hard\nto say.",
    "I rather think it was the gentleman.",
    "But you are not sure\n\nNoo said Mason unwillingly nno I am not sure.",
    "You have seen this gentleman before in Curzon Street\n\nMason shook her head.",
    "I should not be likely to see any visitors that come to Curzon\nStreet she explained unless they were staying in the house.",
    "Very well that will do said the Examining Magistrate sharply.",
    "Evidently he was disappointed.",
    "One moment said Poirot.",
    "There is a question I would like to put\nto Mademoiselle if I may\n\nCertainly M. Poirot  certainly by all means.",
    "Poirot addressed himself to the maid.",
    "What happened to the tickets\n\nThe tickets sir\n\nYes the tickets from London to Nice.",
    "Did you or your mistress\nhave them\n\nThe mistress had her own Pullman ticket sir the others were in\nmy charge.",
    "What happened to them\n\n\fI gave them to the conductor on the French train sir he said it\nwas usual.",
    "I hope I did right sir\n\nOh quite right quite right.",
    "A mere matter of detail.",
    "Both M. Caux and the Examining Magistrate looked at him\ncuriously.",
    "Mason stood uncertainly for a minute or two and then\nthe Magistrate gave her a brief nod of dismissal and she went out.",
    "Poirot scribbled something on a scrap of paper and handed it\nacross to M. Carrege.",
    "The latter read it and his brow cleared.",
    "Well gentlemen demanded the Count haughtily am I to be\ndetained further\n\nAssuredly not assuredly not M. Carrege hastened to say with a\ngreat deal of amiability.",
    "Everything is now cleared up as regards\nyour own position in this affair.",
    "Naturally in view of Madames\nletter we were bound to question you.",
    "The Count rose picked up his handsome stick from the corner\nand with rather a curt bow left the room.",
    "And that is that said M. Carrege.",
    "You were quite right M.\nPoirot  much better to let him feel he is not suspected.",
    "Two of my\nmen will shadow him night and day and at the same time we will\ngo into the question of the alibi.",
    "It seems to me rather  er  a fluid\none.",
    "Possibly agreed Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "I asked M. Kettering to come here this morning continued the\nMagistrate though really I doubt if we have much to ask him but\nthere are one or two suspicious circumstances  He paused\nrubbing his nose.",
    "Such as asked Poirot.",
    "Well  the Magistrate coughed  this lady with whom he is said\nto be travelling  Mademoiselle Mirelle.",
    "She is staying at one hotel\nand he at another.",
    "That strikes me  er  as rather odd.",
    "It looks said M. Caux as though they were being careful.",
    "Exactly said M. Carrege triumphantly and what should they\nhave to be careful about\n\nAn excess of caution is suspicious eh said Poirot.",
    "Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment.",
    "We might I think murmured Poirot ask M. Kettering one or\ntwo questions.",
    "The Magistrate gave instructions.",
    "A moment or two later Derek\nKettering debonair as ever entered the room.",
    "Good morning Monsieur said the Judge politely.",
    "Good morning said Derek Kettering curtly.",
    "You sent for me.",
    "Has anything fresh turned up\n\n\fPray sit down Monsieur.",
    "Derek took a seat and flung his hat and stick on the table.",
    "Well he asked impatiently.",
    "We have so far no fresh data said M. Carrege cautiously.",
    "Thats very interesting said Derek drily.",
    "Did you get me here in\norder to tell me that\n\nWe naturally thought Monsieur that you would like to be\ninformed of the progress of the case said the Magistrate\nseverely.",
    "Even if the progress was nonexistent.",
    "We also wished to ask you a few questions.",
    "Ask away.",
    "You are quite sure that you neither saw nor spoke with your wife\non the train\n\nIve answered that already.",
    "I did not.",
    "You had no doubt your reasons.",
    "Derek stared at him suspiciously.",
    "I  did  not  know  she  was  on  the  train he explained\nspacing his words elaborately as though to someone dull of\nintellect.",
    "That is what you say yes murmured M. Carrege.",
    "A frown suffused Dereks face.",
    "I should like to know what youre driving at.",
    "Do you know what I\nthink M. Carrege\n\nWhat do you think Monsieur\n\nI think the French police are vastly overrated.",
    "Surely you must\nhave some data as to these gangs of train robbers.",
    "Its outrageous\nthat such a thing could happen on a train de luxe like that and that\nthe French police should be helpless to deal with the matter.",
    "We are dealing with it Monsieur never fear.",
    "Madame Kettering I understand did not leave a will interposed\nPoirot suddenly.",
    "His fingertips were joined together and he was\nlooking intently at the ceiling.",
    "I dont think she ever made one said Kettering.",
    "Why\n\nIt is a very pretty little fortune that you inherit there said Poirot a very pretty little fortune.",
    "Although his eyes were still on the ceiling he managed to see the\ndark flush that rose to Derek Ketterings face.",
    "What do you mean and who are you\n\nPoirot gently uncrossed his knees withdrew his gaze from the\nceiling and looked the young man full in the face.",
    "My name is Hercule Poirot he said quietly and I am probably\nthe greatest detective in the world.",
    "You are quite sure that you did\nnot see or speak to your wife on that train\n\nWhat are you getting at Do you  do you mean to insinuate that I I killed her\n\nHe laughed suddenly.",
    "I mustnt lose my temper its too palpably absurd.",
    "Why if I killed\nher I should have had no need to steal her jewels would I\n\nThat is true murmured Poirot with a rather crestfallen air.",
    "I did\nnot think of that.",
    "If ever there were a clear case of murder and robbery this is it\nsaid Derek Kettering.",
    "Poor Ruth it was those damned rubies did\nfor her.",
    "It must have got about she had them with her.",
    "There has\nbeen murder done for those same stones before now I believe.",
    "Poirot sat up suddenly in his chair.",
    "A very faint green light glowed\nin his eyes.",
    "He looked extraordinarily like a sleek wellfed cat.",
    "One more question M. Kettering he said.",
    "Will you give me the\ndate when you last saw your wife\n\nLet me see Kettering reflected.",
    "It must have been \u2013 yes over\nthree weeks ago.",
    "I am afraid I cant give you the date exactly.",
    "No matter said Poirot drily that is all I wanted to know.",
    "Well said Derek Kettering impatiently anything further\n\nHe looked towards M. Carrege.",
    "The latter sought inspiration from\nPoirot and received it in a very faint shake of the head.",
    "No M. Kettering he said politely no I do not think we need\ntrouble you any further.",
    "I wish you good morning.",
    "Good morning said Kettering.",
    "He went out banging the door\nbehind him.",
    "Poirot leaned forward and spoke sharply as soon as the young\nman was out of the room.",
    "Tell me he said peremptorily when\ndid you speak of these rubies to M. Kettering\n\nI have not spoken of them said M. Carrege.",
    "It was only\nyesterday afternoon that we learnt about them from M. Van Aldin.",
    "Yes but there was a mention of them in the Comtes letter.",
    "M. Carrege looked pained.",
    "Naturally I did not speak of that letter to M. Kettering he said in\na shocked voice.",
    "It would have been most indiscreet at the\npresent juncture of affairs.",
    "Poirot leaned forward and tapped the table.",
    "Then how did he know about them he demanded softly.",
    "Madame could not have told him for he has not seen her for\nthree weeks.",
    "It seems unlikely that either M. Van Aldin or his\nsecretary would have mentioned them their interviews with him\nhave been on entirely different lines and there has not been any\nhint or reference to them in the newspapers.",
    "He got up and took his hat and stick.",
    "And yet he murmured to himself our gentleman knows all\nabout them.",
    "I wonder now yes I wonder\n\nChapter 18\n\nDEREK LUNCHES\n\nDerek Kettering went straight to the Negresco where he ordered\na couple of cocktails and disposed of them rapidly then he stared\nmoodily out over the dazzling blue sea.",
    "He noted the passersby\nmechanically  a damned dull crowd badly dressed and painfully\nuninteresting one hardly ever saw anything worth while\n\n\fnowadays.",
    "Then he corrected this last impression rapidly as a\nwoman placed herself at a table a little distance away from him.",
    "She was wearing a marvellous confection of orange and black\nwith a little hat that shaded her face.",
    "He ordered a third cocktail\nagain he stared out to sea and then suddenly he started.",
    "A wellknown perfume assailed his nostrils and he looked up to see the\norangeandblack lady standing beside him.",
    "He saw her face now\nand recognized her  it was Mirelle.",
    "She was smiling that insolent\nseductive smile he knew so well.",
    "Dereek she murmured.",
    "You are pleased to see me no\n\nShe dropped into a seat the other side of the table.",
    "But welcome me then stupid one she mocked.",
    "This is an unexpected pleasure said Derek.",
    "When did you\nleave London\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.",
    "A day or two ago.",
    "And the Parthenon\n\nI have how do you say it  given them the chuck\n\nReally\n\nYou are not very amiable Dereek.",
    "Do you expect me to be\n\nMirelle lit a cigarette and puffed at it for a few minutes before\nsaying\n\nYou think perhaps that it is not prudent so soon\n\nDerek stared at her then he shrugged his shoulders and\nremarked formally\n\nYou are lunching here\n\nMais oui.",
    "I am lunching with you.",
    "I am extremely sorry said Derek.",
    "I have a very important\nengagement.",
    "Mon Dieu But you men are like children exclaimed the dancer.",
    "But yes its the spoilt child that you act to me ever since that day\nin London when you flung yourself out of my flat you sulk.",
    "Ah\nmais cest inou\u00ef\n\nMy dear girl said Derek I really dont know what you are\ntalking about.",
    "We agreed in London that rats desert a sinking ship\nthat is all that there is to be said.",
    "In spite of his careless words his face looked haggard and\nstrained.",
    "Mirelle leaned forward suddenly.",
    "You cannot deceive me she murmured.",
    "I know  I know what\nyou have done for me.",
    "He looked up at her sharply.",
    "Some undercurrent in her voice\narrested his attention.",
    "She nodded her head at him.",
    "Ah have no fear I am discreet.",
    "You are magnificent You have a\nsuperb courage but all the same it was I who gave you the idea\nthat day when I said to you in London that accidents sometimes\nhappened.",
    "And you are not in danger The police do not suspect\nyou\n\nWhat the devil \n\nHush\n\nShe held up a slim olive hand with one big emerald on the little\nfinger.",
    "You are right I should not have spoken in so a public place.",
    "We\nwill not speak of the matter again but our troubles are ended our\nlife together will be wonderful  wonderful\n\nDerek laughed suddenly  a harsh disagreeable laugh.",
    "So the rats come back do they Two million makes a difference of course it does.",
    "I ought to have known that.",
    "He laughed again.",
    "You will help me to spend that two million wont you Mirelle You\nknow how no woman better.",
    "He laughed again.",
    "Hush cried the dancer.",
    "What is the matter with you Dereek\nSee  people are turning to stare at you.",
    "Me I will tell you what is the matter.",
    "I have finished with you\nMirelle.",
    "Do you hear Finished\n\nMirelle did not take it as he expected her to do.",
    "She looked at him\nfor a minute or two and then she smiled softly.",
    "But what a child You are angry  you are sore and all because I\nam practical.",
    "Did I not always tell you that I adored you\n\nShe leaned forward.",
    "But I know you Dereek.",
    "Look at me  see it is Mirelle who\nspeaks to you.",
    "You cannot live without her you know it.",
    "I loved you\nbefore I will love you a hundred times more now.",
    "I will make life\nwonderful for you  but wonderful.",
    "There is no one like Mirelle.",
    "Her eyes burned into his.",
    "She saw him grow pale and draw in his\nbreath and she smiled to herself contentedly.",
    "She knew her own\nmagic and power over men.",
    "That is settled she said softly and gave a little laugh.",
    "And now\nDereek will you give me lunch\n\nNo.",
    "He drew in his breath sharply and rose to his feet.",
    "I am sorry but I told you  I have got an engagement.",
    "You are lunching with someone else Bah I dont believe it.",
    "I am lunching with that lady over there.",
    "He crossed abruptly to where a lady in white had just come up the\nsteps.",
    "He addressed her a little breathlessly.",
    "Miss Grey will you  will you have lunch with me You met me at\nLady Tamplins if you remember.",
    "Katherine looked at him for a minute or so with those thoughtful\ngrey eyes that said so much.",
    "Thank you she said after a moments pause I should like to\nvery much.",
    "Chapter 19\n\nAN UNEXPECTED VISITOR\n\nThe Comte de la Roche had just finished d\u00e9jeuner consisting of\nan omelette fines herbes an entrec\u00f4te Bearnaise and a Savarin\nau Rhum.",
    "Wiping his fine black moustache delicately with his table\nnapkin the Comte rose from the table.",
    "He passed through the\n\n\fsalon of the villa noting with appreciation the few objets dart\nwhich were carelessly scattered about.",
    "The Louis XV snuffbox\nthe satin shoe worn by Marie Antoinette and the other historic\ntrifles were part of the Comtes mise en scene.",
    "They were he\nwould explain to his fair visitors heirlooms in his family.",
    "Passing\nthrough on to the terrace the Comte looked out on the\nMediterranean with an unseeing eye.",
    "He was in no mood for\nappreciating the beauties of scenery.",
    "A fully matured scheme had\nbeen rudely brought to naught and his plans had to be cast\nafresh.",
    "Stretching himself out in a basket chair a cigarette held\nbetween his white fingers the Comte pondered deeply.",
    "Presently Hippolyte his manservant brought out coffee and a\nchoice of liqueurs.",
    "The Comte selected some very fine old brandy.",
    "As the manservant was preparing to depart the Comte arrested\nhim with a slight gesture.",
    "Hippolyte stood respectfully to attention.",
    "His countenance was hardly a prepossessing one but the\ncorrectitude of his demeanour went far to obliterate the fact.",
    "He was now the picture of respectful attention.",
    "It is possible said the Comte that in the course of the next few\ndays various strangers may come to the house.",
    "They will\nendeavour to scrape acquaintance with you and with Marie.",
    "They\nwill probably ask you various questions concerning me.",
    "Yes Monsieur le Comte.",
    "Perhaps this has already happened\n\nNo Monsieur le Comte.",
    "There have been no strangers about the place You are certain\n\nThere has been no one Monsieur le Comte.",
    "That is well said the Comte drily nevertheless they will come I am sure of it.",
    "They will ask questions.",
    "Hippolyte looked at his master in intelligent anticipation.",
    "The Comte spoke slowly without looking at Hippolyte.",
    "As you know I arrived here last Tuesday morning.",
    "If the police or\nany other inquirer should question you do not forget that fact.",
    "I\narrived on Tuesday the 14th  not Wednesday the 15th.",
    "You\nunderstand\n\nPerfectly Monsieur le Comte.",
    "In an affair where a lady is concerned it is always necessary to\nbe discreet.",
    "I feel certain Hippolyte that you can be discreet.",
    "I can be discreet Monsieur.",
    "And Marie\n\nMarie also.",
    "I will answer for her.",
    "That is well then murmured the Comte.",
    "When Hippolyte had withdrawn the Comte sipped his black coffee\nwith a reflective air.",
    "Occasionally he frowned once he shook his\nhead slightly twice he nodded it  into the midst of these\ncogitations came Hippolyte once more.",
    "A lady Monsieur.",
    "A lady\n\nThe Comte was surprised.",
    "Not that a visit from a lady was an\nunusual thing at the Villa Marina but at this particular moment the\nComte could not think who the lady was likely to be.",
    "She is I think a lady not known to Monsieur murmured the valet\nhelpfully.",
    "The Comte was more and more intrigued.",
    "Show her out here Hippolyte he commanded.",
    "A moment later a marvellous vision in orange and black stepped\nout on the terrace accompanied by a strong perfume of exotic\nblossoms.",
    "Monsieur le Comte de la Roche\n\nAt your service Mademoiselle said the Comte bowing.",
    "My name is Mirelle.",
    "You may have heard of me.",
    "Ah indeed Mademoiselle but who has not been enchanted by\nthe dancing of Mademoiselle Mirelle Exquisite\n\nThe\n\ndancer\n\nacknowledged\n\nthis\n\ncompliment\n\nwith\n\na\n\nbrief\n\nmechanical smile.",
    "My descent upon you is unceremonious she began.",
    "But seat yourself I beg of you Mademoiselle cried the Comte\nbringing forward a chair.",
    "Behind the gallantry of his manner he was observing her narrowly.",
    "There were very few things that the Comte did not know about\nwomen.",
    "True his experience had not lain much in ladies of\nMirelles class who were themselves predatory.",
    "He and the\ndancer were in a sense birds of a feather.",
    "His arts the Comte\nknew would be thrown away on Mirelle.",
    "She was a Parisienne\nand a shrewd one.",
    "Nevertheless there was one thing that the\nComte could recognize infallibly when he saw it.",
    "He knew at once\nthat he was in the presence of a very angry woman and an angry\nwoman as the Comte was well aware always says more than is\nprudent and is occasionally a source of profit to a levelheaded\ngentleman who keeps cool.",
    "It is most amiable of you Mademoiselle to honour my poor abode\nthus.",
    "We have mutual friends in Paris said Mirelle.",
    "I have heard of\nyou from them but I come to see you today for another reason.",
    "I\nhave heard of you since I came to Nice  in a different way you\nunderstand.",
    "Ah said the Comte softly.",
    "I will be brutal continued the dancer nevertheless believe\nthat I have your welfare at heart.",
    "They are saying in Nice\nMonsieur le Comte that you are the murderer of the English lady\nMadame Kettering.",
    "I  the murderer of Madame Kettering Pah But how absurd\n\nHe spoke more languidly than indignantly knowing that he would\nthus provoke her further.",
    "But yes she insisted it is as I tell you.",
    "It amuses people to talk murmured the Comte indifferently.",
    "It\nwould be beneath me to take such wild accusations seriously.",
    "You do not understand.",
    "Mirelle bent forward her dark eyes\nflashing.",
    "It is not the idle talk of those in the streets.",
    "It is the\npolice.",
    "The police  ah\n\nThe Comte sat up alert once more.",
    "Mirelle nodded her head vigorously several times.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "You comprehend me  I have friends everywhere.",
    "The\nPrefect himself \n\nShe left the sentence unfinished with an eloquent shrug of the\nshoulders.",
    "Who is not indiscreet where a beautiful woman is concerned\nmurmured the Count politely.",
    "The police believe that you killed Mrs Kettering.",
    "But they are\nwrong.",
    "Certainly they are wrong agreed the Comte easily.",
    "You say that but you do not know the truth.",
    "I do.",
    "The Comte looked at her curiously.",
    "You know who killed Madame Kettering Is that what you would\nsay Mademoiselle\n\nMirelle nodded vehemently.",
    "Yes.",
    "Who was it asked the Comte sharply.",
    "Her husband.",
    "She bent nearer to the Comte speaking in a low\nvoice that vibrated with anger and excitement.",
    "It was her\nhusband who killed her.",
    "The Comte leant back in his chair.",
    "His face was a mask.",
    "Let me ask you Mademoiselle  how do you know this\n\nHow do I know it Mirelle sprang to her feet with a laugh.",
    "He\nboasted of it beforehand.",
    "He was ruined bankrupt dishonoured.",
    "Only the death of his wife could save him.",
    "He told me so.",
    "He\ntravelled on the same train  but she was not to know it.",
    "Why was\nthat I ask you So that he might creep upon her in the night  Ah  she shut her eyes  I can see it happening...",
    "The Count coughed.",
    "Perhaps  perhaps he murmured.",
    "But surely Mademoiselle in\nthat case he would not steal the jewels\n\nThe jewels breathed Mirelle.",
    "The jewels.",
    "Ah Those rubies...",
    "Her eyes grew misty a faraway light in them.",
    "The Comte looked\nat her curiously wondering for the hundredth time at the magical\ninfluence of precious stones on the female sex.",
    "He recalled her to\npractical matters.",
    "What do you want me to do Mademoiselle\n\nMirelle became alert and businesslike once more.",
    "Surely it is simple.",
    "You will go to the police.",
    "You will say to them\nthat M. Kettering committed this crime.",
    "And if they do not believe me If they ask for proof He was\neyeing her closely.",
    "Mirelle laughed softly and drew her orangeandblack wrap\ncloser round her.",
    "Send them to me Monsieur le Comte she said softly I will give\nthem the proof they want.",
    "Upon that she was gone an impetuous whirlwind her errand\naccomplished.",
    "The Comte looked after her his eyebrows delicately raised.",
    "She is in a fury he murmured.",
    "What has happened now to\nupset her But she shows her hand too plainly.",
    "Does she really\nbelieve that Mr Kettering killed his wife She would like me to\nbelieve it.",
    "She would even like the police to believe it.",
    "He smiled to himself.",
    "He had no intention whatsoever of going to\nthe police.",
    "He saw various other possibilities to judge by his\nsmile an agreeable vista of them.",
    "Presently however his brow clouded.",
    "According to Mirelle he\nwas suspected by the police.",
    "That might be true or it might not.",
    "An angry woman of the type of the dancer was not likely to bother\nabout the strict veracity of her statements.",
    "On the other hand she\nmight easily have obtained inside information.",
    "In that case  his mouth set grimly  in that case he must take\ncertain precautions.",
    "He went into the house and questioned Hippolyte closely once\nmore as to whether any strangers had been to the house.",
    "The\nvalet was positive in his assurances that this was not the case.",
    "The Comte went up to his bedroom and crossed over to an old\nbureau that stood against the wall.",
    "He let down the lid of this and\nhis delicate fingers sought a spring at the back of one of the\npigeonholes.",
    "A secret drawer flew out in it was a small brown paper package.",
    "The Comte took this out and weighed it in his hand carefully for a\nminute or two.",
    "Raising his hand to his head with a slight grimace\nhe pulled out a single hair.",
    "This he placed on the lip of the drawer\nand shut it carefully.",
    "Still carrying the small parcel in his hand he\nwent downstairs and out of the house to the garage where stood\na scarlet twoseater car.",
    "Ten minutes later he had taken the road\nfor Monte Carlo.",
    "He spent a few hours at the Casino then sauntered out into the\ntown.",
    "Presently he reentered the car and drove off in the direction\nof Mentone.",
    "Earlier in the afternoon he had noticed an\ninconspicuous grey car some little distance behind him.",
    "He\nnoticed it again now.",
    "He smiled to himself.",
    "The road was climbing\nsteadily upwards.",
    "The Comtes foot pressed hard on the\n\n\faccelerator.",
    "The little red car had been specially built to the\nComtes design and had a far more powerful engine than would\nhave been suspected from its appearance.",
    "It shot ahead.",
    "Presently he looked back and smiled the grey car was following\nbehind.",
    "Smothered in dust the little red car leaped along the\nroad.",
    "It was travelling now at a dangerous pace but the Comte\nwas a firstclass driver.",
    "Now they were going downhill twisting and curving unceasingly.",
    "Presently the car slackened speed and finally came to a standstill\nbefore a Bureau de Poste.",
    "The Comte jumped out lifted the lid of\nthe tool chest extracted the small brown paper parcel and\nhurried into the post office.",
    "Two minutes later he was driving once\nmore in the direction of Mentone.",
    "When the grey car arrived there\nthe Comte was drinking English five oclock tea on the terrace of\none of the hotels.",
    "Later he drove back to Monte Carlo dined there and reached\nhome once more at eleven oclock.",
    "Hippolyte came out to meet\nhim with a disturbed face.",
    "Ah Monsieur le Comte has arrived.",
    "Monsieur le Comte did not\ntelephone me by any chance\n\nThe Comte shook his head.",
    "And yet at three oclock I received a summons from Monsieur le\nComte to present myself to him at Nice at the Negresco.",
    "Really said the Comte and you went\n\nCertainly Monsieur but at the Negresco they knew nothing of\nMonsieur le Comte  he had not been there.",
    "Ah said the Comte doubtless at that hour Marie was out doing\nher afternoon marketing\n\nThat is so Monsieur le Comte.",
    "Ah well said the Comte it is of no importance.",
    "A mistake.",
    "He went upstairs smiling to himself.",
    "Once within his own room he bolted his door and looked sharply\nround.",
    "Everything seemed as usual.",
    "He opened various drawers\nand cupboards.",
    "Then he nodded to himself.",
    "Things had been replaced almost exactly as he had left them but\nnot quite.",
    "It was evident that a very thorough search had been\nmade.",
    "He went over to the bureau and pressed the hidden spring.",
    "The\ndrawer flew open but the hair was no longer where he had placed\nit.",
    "He nodded his head several times.",
    "They are excellent our French police he murmured to himself excellent.",
    "Nothing escapes them.",
    "Chapter 20\n\nKATHERINE MAKES A FRIEND\n\nOn the following morning Katherine and Lenox were sitting on the\nterrace of the Villa Marguerite.",
    "Something in the nature of a\nfriendship was springing up between them despite the difference\nin age.",
    "But for Lenox Katherine would have found life at the Villa\nMarguerite quite intolerable.",
    "The Kettering case was the topic of\nthe\n\nmoment.",
    "Lady\n\nTamplin\n\nfrankly\n\nexploited\n\nher\n\nguests\n\nconnection with the affair for all it was worth.",
    "The most persistent rebuffs that Katherine could administer quite\nfailed to pierce Lady Tamplins selfesteem.",
    "Lenox adopted a\ndetached\n\nattitude\n\nseemingly\n\namused\n\nat\n\nher\n\nmothers\n\nmanoeuvres and yet with a sympathetic understanding of\nKatherines feelings.",
    "The situation was not helped by Chubby whose naive delight was\nunquenchable and who introduced Katherine to all and sundry\nas\n\nThis is Miss Grey.",
    "You know that Blue Train business She was in\nit up to the ears Had a long talk with Ruth Kettering a few hours\nbefore the murder Bit of luck for her eh\n\nA few remarks of this kind had provoked Katherine that morning\nto an unusually tart rejoinder and when they were alone together\nLenox observed in her slow drawl\n\n\fNot used to exploitation are you You have a lot to learn\nKatherine.",
    "I am sorry I lost my temper.",
    "I dont as a rule.",
    "It is about time you learnt to blow off steam.",
    "Chubby is only an\nass there is no harm in him.",
    "Mother of course is trying but you\ncan lose your temper with her until Kingdom come and it wont\nmake any impression.",
    "She will open large sad blue eyes at you\nand not care a bit.",
    "Katherine made no reply to this filial observation and Lenox\npresently went on\n\nI am rather like Chubby.",
    "I delight in a good murder and besides well knowing Derek makes a difference.",
    "Katherine nodded.",
    "So you lunched with him yesterday pursued Lenox reflectively.",
    "Do you like him Katherine\n\nKatherine considered for a minute or two.",
    "I dont know she said very slowly.",
    "He is very attractive.",
    "Yes he is attractive.",
    "What dont you like about him\n\nKatherine did not reply to the question or at any rate not directly.",
    "He spoke of his wifes death she said.",
    "He said he would not\npretend that it had been anything but a bit of most marvellous luck\nfor him.",
    "And that shocked you I suppose said Lenox.",
    "She paused and\nthen added in rather a queer tone of voice He likes you\nKatherine.",
    "He gave me a very good lunch said Katherine smiling.",
    "Lenox refused to be sidetracked.",
    "I saw it the night he came here she said thoughtfully.",
    "The way\nhe looked at you and you are not his usual type  just the opposite.",
    "Well I suppose it is like religion  you get it at a certain age.",
    "Mademoiselle is wanted at the telephone said Marie appearing\nat the window of the salon.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot desires to speak\nwith her.",
    "More blood and thunder.",
    "Go on Katherine go and dally with your\ndetective.",
    "M. Hercule Poirots voice came neat and precise in its intonation\nto Katherines ear.",
    "That is Mademoiselle Grey who speaks Mademoiselle I have a\nword for you from M. Van Aldin the father of Madame Kettering.",
    "He wishes very much to speak with you either at the Villa\nMarguerite or at his hotel whichever you prefer.",
    "Katherine reflected for a moment but she decided that for Van\nAldin to come to the Villa Marguerite would be both painful and\nunnecessary.",
    "Lady Tamplin would have hailed his advent with far\ntoo much delight.",
    "She never lost a chance of cultivating\nmillionaires.",
    "She told Poirot that she would much rather come to\nNice.",
    "Excellent Mademoiselle.",
    "I will call for you myself in an auto.",
    "Shall\nwe say in about threequarters of an hour\n\nPunctually to the moment Poirot appeared.",
    "Katherine was waiting\nfor him and they drove off at once.",
    "Well Mademoiselle how goes it\n\nShe looked at his twinkling eyes and was confirmed in her first\nimpression that there was something very attractive about M.\nHercule Poirot.",
    "This is our own Roman Policier is it not said Poirot.",
    "I made\nyou the promise that we should study it together.",
    "And me  I\nalways keep my promises.",
    "You are too kind murmured Katherine.",
    "Ah you mock yourself at me but do you want to hear the\ndevelopments of the case or do you not\n\nKatherine admitted that she did and Poirot proceeded to sketch\nfor her a thumbnail portrait of the Comte de la Roche.",
    "You think he killed her said Katherine thoughtfully.",
    "That is the theory said Poirot guardedly.",
    "Do you yourself believe that\n\nI did not say so.",
    "And you Mademoiselle what do you think\n\nKatherine shook her head.",
    "How should I know I dont know anything about those things but\nI should say that \n\nYes said Poirot encouragingly.",
    "Well  from what you say the Count does not sound the kind of\nman who would actually kill anybody.",
    "Ah Very good cried Poirot you agree with me that is just\nwhat I have said.",
    "He looked at her sharply.",
    "But tell me you have met Mr Derek\nKettering\n\n\fI met him at Lady Tamplins and I lunched with him yesterday.",
    "A mauvais sujet said Poirot shaking his head but les femmes they like that eh\n\nHe twinkled at Katherine and she laughed.",
    "He is the kind of man one would notice anywhere continued\nPoirot.",
    "Doubtless you observed him on the Blue Train\n\nYes I noticed him.",
    "In the restaurant car\n\nNo.",
    "I didnt notice him at meals at all.",
    "I only saw him once  going\ninto his wifes compartment.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "A strange business he murmured.",
    "I believe you\nsaid you were awake Mademoiselle and looked out of your\nwindow at Lyons You saw no tall dark man such as the Comte de\nla Roche leave the train\n\nKatherine shook her head.",
    "I dont think I saw anyone at all she\nsaid.",
    "There was a youngish lad in a cap and overcoat who got\nout but I dont think he was leaving the train only walking up and\ndown the platform.",
    "There was a fat Frenchman with a beard in\npyjamas and an overcoat who wanted a cup of coffee.",
    "Otherwise\nI think there were only the train attendants.",
    "Poirot nodded his head several times.",
    "It is like this you see he\nconfided the Comte de la Roche has an alibi.",
    "An alibi it is a very\npestilential thing and always open to the gravest suspicion.",
    "But\nhere we are\n\nThey went straight up to Van Aldins suite where they found\nKnighton.",
    "Poirot introduced him to Katherine.",
    "After a few\ncommonplaces had been exchanged Knighton said I will tell Mr\nVan Aldin that Miss Grey is here.",
    "He went through a second door into an adjoining room.",
    "There was\na low murmur of voices and then Van Aldin came into the room\nand advanced towards Katherine with outstretched hand giving\nher at the same time a shrewd and penetrating glance.",
    "I am pleased to meet you Miss Grey he said simply.",
    "I have\nbeen wanting very badly to hear what you can tell me about Ruth.",
    "The quiet simplicity of the millionaires manner appealed to\nKatherine strongly.",
    "She felt herself in the presence of a very\ngenuine grief the more real for its absence of outward sign.",
    "He drew forward a chair.",
    "Sit here will you and just tell me all about it.",
    "Poirot and Knighton retired discreetly into the other room and\nKatherine and Van Aldin were left alone together.",
    "She found no\ndifficulty in her task.",
    "Quite simply and naturally she related her\nconversation with Ruth Kettering word for word as nearly as she\n\n\fcould.",
    "He listened in silence leaning back in his chair with one\nhand shading his eyes.",
    "When she had finished he said quietly Thank you my dear.",
    "They both sat silent for a minute or two.",
    "Katherine felt that words of sympathy would be out of place.",
    "When\nthe millionaire spoke it was in a different tone\n\nI am very grateful to you Miss Grey.",
    "I think you did something to\nease my poor Ruths mind in the last hours of her life.",
    "Now I want\nto ask you something.",
    "You know  M. Poirot will have told you about the scoundrel that my poor girl had got herself mixed up\nwith.",
    "He was the man of whom she spoke to you  the man she was\ngoing to meet.",
    "In your judgment do you think she might have\nchanged her mind after her conversation with you Do you think\nshe meant to go back on her word\n\nI cant honestly tell you.",
    "She had certainly come to some\ndecision and seemed more cheerful in consequence of it.",
    "She gave you no idea where she intended to meet the skunk whether in Paris or at Hyeres\n\nKatherine shook her head.",
    "She said nothing as to that.",
    "Ah said Van Aldin thoughtfully and that is the important point.",
    "Well time will show.",
    "He got up and opened the door of the adjoining room.",
    "Poirot and\nKnighton came back.",
    "Katherine declined the millionaires invitation to lunch and\nKnighton went down with her and saw her into the waiting car.",
    "He returned to find Poirot and Van Aldin deep in conversation.",
    "If we only knew said the millionaire thoughtfully what decision\nRuth came to.",
    "It might have been any of half a dozen.",
    "She might\nhave meant to leave the train at Paris and cable to me.",
    "She may\nhave meant to have gone on to the south of France and have an\nexplanation with the Count there.",
    "We are in the dark  absolutely in\nthe dark.",
    "But we have the maids word for it that she was both\nstartled and dismayed at the Counts appearance at the station in\nParis.",
    "That was clearly not part of the preconceived plan  you\nagree with me Knighton\n\nThe secretary started.",
    "I beg your pardon Mr Van Aldin.",
    "I was not\nlistening.",
    "Daydreaming eh said Van Aldin.",
    "Thats not like you.",
    "I believe\nthat girl has bowled you over.",
    "Knighton blushed.",
    "She is a remarkably nice girl said Van Aldin thoughtfully very\nnice.",
    "Did you happen to notice her eyes\n\nAny man said Knighton would be bound to notice her eyes.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nAT THE TENNIS\n\nSeveral days had elapsed.",
    "Katherine had been for a walk by\nherself one morning and came back to find Lenox grinning at her\nexpectantly.",
    "Your young man has been ringing you up Katherine\n\nWho do you call my young man\n\nA new one  Rufus Van Aldins secretary.",
    "You seem to have made\nrather an impression there.",
    "You are becoming a serious breaker\nof hearts Katherine.",
    "First Derek Kettering and now this young\nKnighton.",
    "The funny thing is that I remember him quite well.",
    "He\nwas in Mothers War Hospital that she ran out here.",
    "I was only a\nkid of about eight at the time.",
    "Was he badly wounded\n\nShot in the leg if I remember rightly  rather a nasty business.",
    "I\nthink the doctors messed it up a bit.",
    "They said he wouldnt limp or\n\n\fanything but when he left here he was still completely dot and go\none.",
    "Lady Tamplin came out and joined them.",
    "Have you been telling Katherine about Major Knighton she\nasked.",
    "Such a dear fellow Just at first I didnt remember him one had so many  but now it all comes back.",
    "He was a bit too unimportant to be remembered before said\nLenox.",
    "Now that he is a secretary to an American millionaire it is\na very different matter.",
    "Darling said Lady Tamplin in her vague reproachful voice.",
    "What did Major Knighton ring up about inquired Katherine.",
    "He asked if you would like to go to the tennis this afternoon.",
    "If so\nhe would call for you in a car.",
    "Mother and I accepted for you with\nempressement.",
    "Whilst you dally with a millionaires secretary you\nmight give me a chance with the millionaire Katherine.",
    "He is\nabout sixty I suppose so that he will be looking about for a nice\nsweet young thing like me.",
    "I should like to meet Mr Van Aldin said Lady Tamplin earnestly\none has heard so much of him.",
    "Those fine rugged figures of the\nWestern world  she broke off  so fascinating she murmured.",
    "Major Knighton was very particular to say it was Mr Van Aldins\ninvitation said Lenox.",
    "He said it so often that I began to smell a\n\n\frat.",
    "You and Knighton would make a very nice pair Katherine.",
    "Bless you my children\n\nKatherine laughed and went upstairs to change her clothes.",
    "Knighton arrived soon after lunch and endured manfully Lady\nTamplins transports of recognition.",
    "When they were driving together towards Cannes he remarked to\nKatherine Lady Tamplin has changed wonderfully little.",
    "In manner or appearance\n\nBoth.",
    "She must be I suppose well over forty but she is a\nremarkably beautiful woman still.",
    "She is agreed Katherine.",
    "I am very glad that you could come today went on Knighton.",
    "M.\nPoirot is going to be there also.",
    "What an extraordinary little man\nhe is.",
    "Do you know him well Miss Grey\n\nKatherine shook her head.",
    "I met him on the train on the way here.",
    "I was reading a detective novel and I happened to say something\nabout such things not happening in real life  of course I had no\nidea of who he was.",
    "He is a very remarkable person said Knighton slowly and has\ndone some very remarkable things.",
    "He has a kind of genius for\ngoing to the root of the matter and right up to the end no one has\n\n\fany idea of what he is really thinking.",
    "I remember I was staying at\na house in Yorkshire and Lady Clanravons jewels were stolen.",
    "It\nseemed at first to be a simple robbery but it completely baffled\nthe local police.",
    "I wanted them to call in Hercule Poirot and said\nhe was the only man who could help them but they pinned their\nfaith to Scotland Yard.",
    "And what happened said Katherine curiously.",
    "The jewels were never recovered said Knighton drily.",
    "You really do believe in him\n\nI do indeed.",
    "The Comte de la Roche is a pretty wily customer.",
    "He\nhas wriggled out of most things.",
    "But I think he has met his match\nin Hercule Poirot.",
    "The Comte de la Roche said Katherine thoughtfully so you\nreally think he did it\n\nOf course.",
    "Knighton looked at her in astonishment.",
    "Dont you\n\nOh yes said Katherine hastily that is I mean if it was not just\nan ordinary train robbery.",
    "It might be of course agreed the other but it seems to me that\nthe Comte de la Roche fits into this business particularly well.",
    "And yet he has an alibi.",
    "Oh alibis Knighton laughed his face broke into his attractive\nboyish smile.",
    "You confess that you read detective stories Miss Grey.",
    "You must\nknow that anyone who has a perfect alibi is always open to grave\nsuspicion.",
    "Do you think that real life is like that asked Katherine smiling.",
    "Why not Fiction is founded on fact.",
    "But is rather superior to it suggested Katherine.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "Anyway if I was a criminal I should not like to have\nHercule Poirot on my track.",
    "No more should I said Katherine and laughed.",
    "They were met on arrival by Poirot.",
    "As the day was warm he was\nattired in a white duck suit with a white camellia in his buttonhole.",
    "Bonjour Mademoiselle said Poirot.",
    "I look very English do I\nnot\n\nYou look wonderful said Katherine tactfully.",
    "You mock yourself at me said Poirot genially but no matter.",
    "Papa Poirot he always laughs the last.",
    "Where is Mr Van Aldin asked Knighton.",
    "He will meet us at our seats.",
    "To tell you the truth my friend he is\nnot too well pleased with me.",
    "Oh those Americans  the repose\nthe calm they know it not Mr Van Aldin he would that I fly myself\nin the pursuit of criminals through all the byways of Nice.",
    "I should have thought myself that it would not have been a bad\nplan observed Knighton.",
    "You are wrong said Poirot in these matters one needs not\nenergy but finesse.",
    "At the tennis one meets everyone.",
    "That is so\nimportant.",
    "Ah there is Mr Kettering.",
    "Derek came abruptly up to them.",
    "He looked reckless and angry\nas though something had arisen to upset him.",
    "He and Knighton\ngreeted each other with some frigidity.",
    "Poirot alone seemed unconscious of a sense of strain and chatted\npleasantly in a laudable attempt to put everyone at their ease.",
    "He\npaid little compliments.",
    "It is amazing M. Kettering how well you speak the French he\nobserved  so well that you could be taken for a Frenchman if you\nchose.",
    "That is a very rare accomplishment among Englishmen.",
    "I wish I did said Katherine.",
    "I am only too well aware that my\nFrench is of a painfully British order.",
    "They reached their seats and sat down and almost immediately\nKnighton perceived his employer signalling to him from the other\nend of the court and went off to speak to him.",
    "Me I approve of that young man said Poirot sending a beaming\nsmile after the departing secretary and you Mademoiselle\n\nI like him very much.",
    "And you M. Kettering\n\nSome quick rejoinder was springing to Dereks lips but he\nchecked it as though something in the little Belgians twinkling\neyes had made him suddenly alert.",
    "He spoke carefully choosing\nhis words.",
    "Knighton is a very good fellow he said.",
    "Just for a moment\nKatherine fancied that Poirot looked disappointed.",
    "He is a great admirer of yours M. Poirot she said and she\nrelated some of the things that Knighton had said.",
    "It amused her\nto see the little man plume himself like a bird thrusting out his\nchest and assuming an air of mock modesty that would have\ndeceived no one.",
    "That reminds me Mademoiselle he said suddenly I have a\nlittle matter of business I have to speak to you about.",
    "When you\nwere sitting talking to that poor lady in the train I think you must\nhave dropped a cigarette case.",
    "Katherine looked rather astonished.",
    "I dont think so she said.",
    "Poirot drew from his pocket a cigarette case of soft blue leather\nwith the initial K on it in gold.",
    "No that is not mine Katherine said.",
    "Ah a thousand apologies.",
    "It was doubtless Madames own.",
    "K of\ncourse stands for Kettering.",
    "We were doubtful because she had\nanother cigarette case in her bag and it seemed odd that she\nshould have two.",
    "He turned to Derek suddenly.",
    "You do not know I suppose\nwhether this was your wifes case or not\n\nDerek seemed momentarily taken aback.",
    "He stammered a little in\nhis reply I  I dont know.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "It is not yours by any chance\n\nCertainly not.",
    "If it were mine it would hardly have been in my\nwifes possession.",
    "Poirot looked more ingenuous and childlike than ever.",
    "I thought perhaps you might have dropped it when you were in\nyour wifes compartment he explained guilelessly.",
    "I never was there.",
    "I have already told the police that a dozen\ntimes.",
    "A thousand pardons said Poirot with his most apologetic air.",
    "It\nwas Mademoiselle here who mentioned having seen you going in.",
    "He stopped with an air of embarrassment.",
    "Katherine looked at Derek.",
    "His face had gone rather white but\nperhaps that was her fancy.",
    "His laugh when it came was natural\nenough.",
    "You made a mistake Miss Grey he said easily.",
    "From what the\npolice have told me I gather that my own compartment was only a\ndoor or two away from that of my wifes  though I never suspected\nthe fact at the time.",
    "You must have seen me going into my own\ncompartment.",
    "He got up quickly as he saw Van Aldin and\nKnighton approaching.",
    "Im going to leave you now he announced.",
    "I cant stand my\nfatherinlaw at any price.",
    "Van Aldin greeted Katherine very courteously but was clearly in a\nbad humour.",
    "You seem fond of watching tennis M. Poirot he growled.",
    "It is a pleasure to me yes cried Poirot placidly.",
    "It is as well you are in France said Van Aldin.",
    "We are made of\nsterner stuff in the States.",
    "Business comes before pleasure\nthere.",
    "Poirot did not take offence indeed he smiled gently and\nconfidingly at the irate millionaire.",
    "Do not enrage yourself I beg of you.",
    "Everyone has his own\nmethods.",
    "Me I have always found it a delightful and pleasing idea\nto combine business and pleasure together.",
    "He glanced at the other two.",
    "They were deep in conversation\nabsorbed in each other.",
    "Poirot nodded his head in satisfaction\nand then leant towards the millionaire lowering his voice as he\ndid so.",
    "It is not only for pleasure that I am here M. Van Aldin.",
    "Observe\njust opposite us that ill old man  the one with the yellow face and\nthe venerable beard.",
    "Well what of him\n\nThat Poirot said is M. Papopolous.",
    "A Greek eh\n\nAs you say  a Greek.",
    "He is a dealer in antiques of worldwide\nreputation.",
    "He has a small shop in Paris and he is suspected by\nthe police of being something more.",
    "What\n\nA receiver of stolen goods especially jewels.",
    "There is nothing as\nto the recutting and resetting of gems that he does not know.",
    "He\n\n\fdeals with the highest in Europe and with the lowest of the riffraff\nof the underworld.",
    "Van Aldin was looking at Poirot with suddenly awakened attention.",
    "Well he demanded a new note in his voice.",
    "I ask myself said Poirot I Hercule Poirot  he thumped\nhimself dramatically on the chest  ask myself why is M.\nPapopolous suddenly come to Nice\n\nVan Aldin was impressed.",
    "For a moment he had doubted Poirot\nand suspected the little man of being past his job a poseur only now in a moment he switched back to his original opinion.",
    "He\nlooked straight at the little detective.",
    "I must apologize to you M. Poirot.",
    "Poirot waved the apology aside with an extravagant gesture.",
    "Bah he cried all that is of no importance.",
    "Now listen M. Van\nAldin I have news for you.",
    "The millionaire looked sharply at him all his interest aroused.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "It is as I say.",
    "You will be interested.",
    "As you know M. Van Aldin\nthe Comte de la Roche has been under surveillance ever since his\n\n\finterview with the Juge dInstruction.",
    "The day after that during his\nabsence the Villa Marina was searched by the police.",
    "Well said Van Aldin did they find anything I bet they didnt.",
    "Poirot made him a little bow.",
    "Your acumen is not at fault M. Van Aldin.",
    "They found nothing of\nan incriminating nature.",
    "It was not to be expected that they would.",
    "The Comte de la Roche as your expressive idiom has it was not\nborn on the preceding day.",
    "He is an astute gentleman with great\nexperience.",
    "Well go on growled Van Aldin.",
    "It may be of course that the Comte had nothing of a\ncompromising nature to conceal.",
    "But we must not neglect the\npossibility.",
    "If then he has something to conceal where is it Not in\nhis house  the police searched thoroughly.",
    "Not on his person for\nhe knows that he is liable to arrest at any minute.",
    "There remains his car.",
    "As I say he was under surveillance.",
    "He was followed on\nthat day to Monte Carlo.",
    "From there he went by road to Mentone\ndriving himself.",
    "His car is a very powerful one it outdistanced his\npursuers and for about a quarter of an hour they completely lost\nsight of him.",
    "And during that time you think he concealed something by the\nroadside asked Van Aldin keenly interested.",
    "By the roadside no.",
    "\u00c7a nest pas pratique.",
    "But listen now  me I\nhave made a little suggestion to M. Carrege.",
    "He is graciously\npleased to approve of it.",
    "In each Bureau de Poste in the\nneighbourhood it has been seen to that there is someone who\nknows the Comte de la Roche by sight.",
    "Because you see\nMessieurs the best way of hiding a thing is by sending it away by\nthe post.",
    "Well demanded Van Aldin his face was keenly alight with\ninterest and expectation.",
    "Well  With a dramatic flourish Poirot drew out from his pocket a\nloosely wrapped brown paper package from which the string had\nbeen removed.",
    "During that quarter of an hours interval our good gentleman\nmailed this.",
    "The address asked the other sharply.",
    "Poirot nodded his head.",
    "Might have told us something but unfortunately it does not.",
    "The\npackage was addressed to one of these little newspaper shops in\nParis where letters and parcels are kept until called for on\npayment of a small commission.",
    "Yes but what is inside demanded Van Aldin impatiently.",
    "Poirot unwrapped the brown paper and disclosed a square\ncardboard box.",
    "He looked round him.",
    "It is a good moment he said quietly.",
    "All eyes are on the tennis.",
    "Look Monsieur\n\nHe lifted the lid of the box for the fraction of a second.",
    "An\nexclamation of utter astonishment came from the millionaire.",
    "His\nface turned as white as chalk.",
    "My God he breathed the rubies.",
    "He sat for a minute as though dazed.",
    "Poirot restored the box to his\npocket.",
    "Then suddenly the millionaire seemed to come out of his\ntrance he leaned across to Poirot and wrung his hand so heartily\nthat the little man winced with pain.",
    "This is great said Van Aldin.",
    "Great You are the goods M.\nPoirot.",
    "Once and for all you are the goods.",
    "It is nothing said Poirot modestly.",
    "Order method being\nprepared for eventualities beforehand  that is all there is to it.",
    "And now I suppose the Comte de la Roche has been arrested\ncontinued Van Aldin eagerly.",
    "No said Poirot.",
    "A look of utter astonishment came over Van Aldins face.",
    "But why What more do you want\n\nThe Comtes alibi is still unshaken.",
    "But that is nonsense.",
    "Yes said Poirot I rather think it is nonsense but unfortunately\nwe have to prove it so.",
    "In the meantime he will slip through your fingers.",
    "Poirot shook his head very energetically.",
    "No he said he will not do that.",
    "The one thing the Comte cannot\nafford to sacrifice is his social position.",
    "At all costs he must stop\nand brazen it out.",
    "Van Aldin was still dissatisfied.",
    "But I dont see \n\nPoirot raised a hand.",
    "Grant me a little moment Monsieur.",
    "Me I\nhave a little idea.",
    "Many have mocked themselves at the little ideas\nof Hercule Poirot  and they have been wrong.",
    "Well said Van Aldin go ahead.",
    "What is this little idea\n\nPoirot paused for a moment and then he said\n\n\fI will call upon you at your hotel at eleven oclock tomorrow\nmorning.",
    "Until then say nothing to anyone.",
    "Chapter 22\n\nM. PAPOPOULOS AT BREAKFAST\n\nM. Papopolous was at breakfast.",
    "Opposite him sat his daughter\nZia.",
    "There was a knock at the sittingroom door and a chasseur\nentered with a card which he brought to Mr Papopolous.",
    "The latter\nscrutinized it raised his eyebrows and passed it over to his\ndaughter.",
    "Ah said M. Papopolous scratching his left ear thoughtfully\nHercule Poirot.",
    "I wonder now.",
    "Father and daughter looked at each other.",
    "I saw him yesterday at the tennis said M. Papopolous.",
    "Zia I\nhardly like this.",
    "He was very useful to you once his daughter reminded him.",
    "That is true acknowledged M. Papopolous also he has retired\nfrom active work so I hear.",
    "These interchanges between father and daughter had passed in\ntheir own language.",
    "Now M. Papopolous turned to the chasseur\nand said in French\n\nFaites monter ce monsieur.",
    "A few minutes later Hercule Poirot exquisitely attired and\nswinging a cane with a jaunty air entered the room.",
    "My dear M. Papopolous.",
    "My dear M. Poirot.",
    "And Mademoiselle Zia.",
    "Poirot swept her a low bow.",
    "You will excuse us going on with our breakfast said M.\nPapopolous pouring himself out another cup of coffee.",
    "Your call\nis  ahem  a little early.",
    "It is scandalous said Poirot but see you I am pressed.",
    "Ah murmured M. Papopolous you are on an affair then\n\nA very serious affair said Poirot the death of Madame\nKettering.",
    "Let me see M. Papopolous looked innocently up at the ceiling\nthat was the lady who died on the Blue Train was it not I saw a\nmention of it in the papers but theres no suggestion of foul play.",
    "In the interests of justice said Poirot it was thought best to\nsuppress that fact.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "And in what way can I assist you Mr Poirot asked the dealer\npolitely.",
    "Voil\u00e0 said Poirot I shall come to the point.",
    "He took from his\npocket the same box that he had displayed at Cannes and\nopening it he took out the rubies and pushed them across the\ntable to Papopolous.",
    "Although Poirot was watching him narrowly not a muscle of the\nold mans face moved.",
    "He took up the jewels and examined them\nwith a kind of detached interest then he looked across at the\ndetective inquiringly\n\nSuperb are they not asked Poirot.",
    "Quite excellent said M. Papopolous.",
    "How much should you say they are worth\n\nThe Greeks face quivered a little.",
    "Is it really necessary to tell you M. Poirot he asked.",
    "You are shrewd M. Papopolous.",
    "No it is not.",
    "They are not for\ninstance worth five hundred thousand dollars.",
    "Papopolous laughed and Poirot joined with him.",
    "As an imitation said Papopolous handing them back to Poirot\nthey are as I said quite excellent.",
    "Would it be indiscreet to ask\nM. Poirot where you came across them\n\nNot at all said Poirot I have no objection to telling an old friend\nlike yourself.",
    "They were in the possession of the Comte de la\nRoche.",
    "M. Papopolous eyebrows lifted themselves eloquently.",
    "Indeed he murmured.",
    "Poirot leant forward and assumed his most innocent and beguiling\nair.",
    "M. Papopolous he said I am going to lay my cards upon the\ntable.",
    "The original of these jewels was stolen from Madame\nKettering on the Blue Train.",
    "Now I will say to you first this I am not\nconcerned with the recovery of these jewels.",
    "That is the affair of\nthe police.",
    "I am working not for the police but for M. Van Aldin.",
    "I\nwant to lay hands on the man who killed Madame Kettering.",
    "I am\ninterested in the jewels only in so far as they may lead me to the\nman.",
    "You understand\n\nThe last two words were uttered with great magnificence.",
    "M.\nPapopolous his face quite unmoved said quietly Go on.",
    "It seems to me probable Monsieur that the jewels will change\nhands in Nice  maybe they have done so.",
    "Ah said M. Papopolous.",
    "He sipped his coffee reflectively and looked a shade more noble\nand patriarchal than usual.",
    "I say to myself continued Poirot with animation what good\nfortune My old friend M. Papopolous is in Nice.",
    "He will aid me.",
    "And how do you think I can aid you inquired M. Papopolous\ncoldly.",
    "I said to myself without doubt M. Papopolous is in Nice on\nbusiness.",
    "Not at all said M. Papopolous I am here for my health  by the\ndoctors orders.",
    "He coughed hollowly.",
    "I am desolated to hear it replied Poirot with somewhat\ninsincere sympathy.",
    "But to continue.",
    "When a Russian Grand\nDuke an Austrian Archduchess or an Italian Prince wish to\ndispose of their family jewels  to whom do they go To M.\nPapopolous is it not He who is famous all over the world for the\ndiscretion with which he arranges these things.",
    "The other bowed.",
    "You flatter me.",
    "It is a great thing discretion mused Poirot and was rewarded\nby the fleeting smile which passed across the Greeks face.",
    "I too\ncan be discreet.",
    "The eyes of the two men met.",
    "Then Poirot went on speaking very slowly and obviously picking\nhis words with care.",
    "I say to myself this if these jewels have changed hands in Nice\nM. Papopolous would have heard of it.",
    "He has knowledge of all\nthat passes in the jewel world.",
    "Ah said M. Papopolous and helped himself to a croissant.",
    "The police you understand said M. Poirot do not enter into the\nmatter.",
    "It is a personal affair.",
    "One hears rumours admitted M. Papopolous cautiously.",
    "Such as prompted Poirot.",
    "Is there any reason why I should pass them on\n\nYes said Poirot I think there is.",
    "You may remember M.\nPapopolous that seventeen years ago there was a certain article\nin your hands left there as security by a very  er  Prominent\n\n\fPerson.",
    "It was in your keeping and it unaccountably disappeared.",
    "You were if I may use the English expression in the soup.",
    "His eyes came gently round to the girl.",
    "She had pushed her cup\nand plate aside and with both elbows on the table and her chin\nresting on her hands was listening eagerly.",
    "Still keeping an eye on\nher he went on\n\nI am in Paris at the time.",
    "You send for me.",
    "You place yourself in\nmy hands.",
    "If I restore to you that  article you say I shall earn your\nundying gratitude.",
    "Eh bien I did restore it to you.",
    "A long sigh came from M. Papopolous.",
    "It was the most unpleasant moment of my career he murmured.",
    "Seventeen years is a long time said Poirot thoughtfully but I\nbelieve that I am right in saying Monsieur that your race does not\nforget.",
    "A Greek murmured Papopolous with an ironical smile.",
    "It was not as a Greek I meant said Poirot.",
    "There was a silence and then the old man drew himself up\nproudly.",
    "You are right M. Poirot he said quietly.",
    "I am a Jew.",
    "And as you\nsay our race does not forget.",
    "You will aid me then\n\nAs regards the jewels Monsieur I can do nothing.",
    "The old man as Poirot had done just now picked his words\ncarefully.",
    "I know nothing.",
    "I have heard nothing but I can perhaps do you a\ngood turn  that is if you are interested in racing.",
    "Under certain circumstances I might be said Poirot eyeing him\nsteadily.",
    "There is a horse running at Longchamps that would I think\nrepay attention.",
    "I cannot say for certain you understand this\nnews passed through so many hands.",
    "He stopped fixing Poirot with his eye as though to make sure that\nthe latter was comprehending him.",
    "Perfectly perfectly said Poirot nodding.",
    "The name of the horse said M. Papopolous leaning back and\njoining the tips of his fingers together is the Marquis.",
    "I think but I\nam not sure that it is an English horse eh Zia\n\nI think so too said the girl.",
    "Poirot got up briskly.",
    "I thank you Monsieur he said.",
    "It is a great thing to have what\nthe English call a tip from the stable.",
    "Au revoir Monsieur and\nmany thanks.",
    "He turned to the girl.",
    "Au revoir Mademoiselle Zia.",
    "It seems to me but yesterday that I\nsaw you in Paris.",
    "One would say that two years had passed at\nmost.",
    "There is a difference between sixteen and thirtythree said Zia\nruefully.",
    "Not in your case declared Poirot gallantly.",
    "You and your father\nwill perhaps dine with me one night.",
    "We shall be delighted replied Zia.",
    "Then we will arrange it declared Poirot and now  je me\nsauve.",
    "Poirot walked along the street humming a little tune to himself.",
    "He\ntwirled his stick with a jaunty air once or twice he smiled to\nhimself quietly.",
    "He turned into the first Bureau de Poste he came\nto and sent off a telegram.",
    "He took some time in wording it but it was in code and he had to\ncall upon his memory.",
    "It purported to deal with a missing scarfpin and was addressed to Inspector Japp Scotland Yard.",
    "Decoded it was short and to the point.",
    "Wire me everything\nknown about man whose soubriquet is the Marquis.",
    "Chapter 23\n\nA NEW THEORY\n\nIt was exactly eleven oclock when Poirot presented himself at Van\nAldins hotel.",
    "He found the millionaire alone.",
    "You are punctual M. Poirot he said with a smile as he rose to\ngreet the detective.",
    "I am always punctual said Poirot.",
    "The exactitude  always do I\nobserve it.",
    "Without order and method \n\nHe broke off.",
    "Ah but it is possible that I have said these things to\nyou before.",
    "Let us come at once to the object of my visit.",
    "Your little idea\n\nYes my little idea.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "First of all Monsieur I should\nlike to interview once more the maid Ada Mason.",
    "She is here\n\nYes shes here.",
    "Ah\n\n\fVan Aldin looked at him curiously.",
    "He rang the bell and a\nmessenger was dispatched to find Mason.",
    "Poirot greeted her with his usual politeness which was never\nwithout effect on that particular class.",
    "Good afternoon Mademoiselle he said cheerfully.",
    "Be seated\nwill you not if Monsieur permits.",
    "Yes yes sit down my girl said Van Aldin.",
    "Thank you sir said Mason primly and she sat down on the\nextreme edge of a chair.",
    "She looked bonier and more acid than\never.",
    "I have come to ask you yet more questions said Poirot.",
    "We\nmust get to the bottom of this affair.",
    "Always I return to the\nquestion of the man in the train.",
    "You have been shown the Comte\nde la Roche.",
    "You say that it is possible he was the man but you\nare not sure.",
    "As I told you sir I never saw the gentlemans face.",
    "That is what\nmakes it so difficult.",
    "Poirot beamed and nodded.",
    "Precisely exactly.",
    "I comprehend well the difficulty.",
    "Now\nMademoiselle you have been in the service of Madame Kettering\ntwo months you say.",
    "During that time how often did you see your\nmaster\n\n\fMason reflected a minute or two and then said\n\nOnly twice sir.",
    "And was that near to or far away\n\nWell once sir he came to Curzon Street.",
    "I was upstairs and I\nlooked over the banisters and saw him in the hall below.",
    "I was a bit\ncurious like you understand knowing the way things  er  were.",
    "Mason finished up with her discreet cough.",
    "And the other time\n\nI was in the Park sir with Annie  one of the housemaids sir and\nshe pointed out the master to me walking with a foreign lady.",
    "Again Poirot nodded.",
    "Now listen Mason this man whom you saw in the carriage\ntalking to your mistress at the Gare de Lyon how do you know it\nwas not your master\n\nThe master sir Oh I dont think it would have been.",
    "But you are not sure Poirot persisted.",
    "Well  I never thought of it sir.",
    "Mason was clearly upset at the idea.",
    "You have heard that your master was also on the train.",
    "What\nmore natural than that it should be he who came along the\ncorridor.",
    "But the gentleman who was talking to the mistress must have\ncome from outside sir.",
    "He was dressed for the street.",
    "In an\novercoat and soft hat.",
    "Just so Mademoiselle but reflect a minute.",
    "The train has just\narrived at the Gare de Lyon.",
    "Many of the passengers promenade\nthemselves upon the quay.",
    "Your mistress was about to do so and\nfor that purpose had doubtless put on her fur coat eh\n\nYes sir agreed Mason.",
    "Your master then does the same.",
    "The train is heated but\noutside in the station it is cold.",
    "He puts on his overcoat and his hat\nand he walks along beside the train and looking up at the lighted\nwindows he suddenly sees Madame Kettering.",
    "Until then he has\nhad no idea that she was on the train.",
    "Naturally he mounts the\ncarriage and goes to her compartment.",
    "She gives an exclamation\nof surprise at seeing him and quickly shuts the door between the\ntwo compartments since it is possible that their conversation may\nbe of a private nature.",
    "He leaned back in his chair and watched the suggestion slowly\ntake effect.",
    "No one knew better than Hercule Poirot that the class\nto which Mason belongs cannot be hurried.",
    "He must give her time to get rid of her own preconceived ideas.",
    "At\nthe end of three minutes she spoke\n\nWell of course sir it might be so.",
    "I never thought of it that way.",
    "The master is tall and dark and just about that build.",
    "It was seeing\nthe hat and coat that made me say it was a gentleman from\noutside.",
    "Yes it might have been the master.",
    "I would not like to say\neither way I am sure.",
    "Thank you very much Mademoiselle.",
    "I shall not require you any\nfurther.",
    "Ah just one thing more.",
    "He took from his pocket the\ncigarette case he had already shown to Katherine.",
    "Is that your\nmistresss case he said to Mason.",
    "No sir it is not the mistresss  at least \n\nShe looked suddenly startled.",
    "An idea was clearly working its way\nto the forefront of her mind.",
    "Yes said Poirot encouragingly.",
    "I think sir  I cant be sure but I think  it is a case that the\nmistress bought to give to the master.",
    "Ah said Poirot in a noncommittal manner.",
    "But whether she ever did give it to him or not I cant say of\ncourse.",
    "Precisely\n\nsaid\n\nPoirot\n\nprecisely.",
    "That\n\nis\n\nall\n\nI\n\nthink\n\nMademoiselle.",
    "I wish you good afternoon.",
    "Ada Mason retired discreetly closing the door noiselessly behind\nher.",
    "Poirot looked across at Van Aldin a faint smile upon his face.",
    "The\nmillionaire looked thunderstruck.",
    "You think  you think it was Derek he queried but  everything\npoints the other way.",
    "Why the Count has actually been caught\nredhanded with the jewels on him.",
    "No.",
    "But you told me \n\nWhat did I tell you\n\nThat story about the jewels.",
    "You showed them to me.",
    "No.",
    "Van Aldin stared at him.",
    "You mean to say you didnt show them to me.",
    "No.",
    "Yesterday  at the tennis\n\n\fNo.",
    "Are you crazy M. Poirot or am I\n\nNeither of us is crazy said the detective.",
    "You ask me a\nquestion I answer it.",
    "You say have I not shown you the jewels that\nday I reply  no.",
    "What I showed you Van Aldin was a firstclass\nimitation not to be distinguished except by an expert from the real\nones.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nPOIROT GIVES ADVICE\n\nIt took the millionaire some few minutes to take the thing in.",
    "He\nstared at Poirot as though dumbfounded.",
    "The little Belgian\nnodded at him gently.",
    "Yes he said it alters the position does it not\n\nImitation\n\nHe leaned forward.",
    "All along M. Poirot you have had this idea All along this is what\nyou have been driving at You never believed that the Comte de la\nRoche was the murderer\n\n\fI have had doubts said Poirot quietly.",
    "I said as much to you.",
    "Robbery with violence and murder  he shook his head\nenergetically  no it is difficult to picture.",
    "It does not harmonize\nwith the personality of the Comte de la Roche.",
    "But you believe that he meant to steal the rubies\n\nCertainly.",
    "There is no doubt as to that.",
    "See I will recount to you\nthe affair as I see it.",
    "The Comte knew of the rubies and he laid his\nplans accordingly.",
    "He made up a romantic story of a book he was\nwriting so as to induce your daughter to bring them with her.",
    "He\nprovided himself with an exact duplicate.",
    "It is clear is it not that\nsubstitution is what he was after.",
    "Madame your daughter was not\nan expert on jewels.",
    "It would probably be a long time before she\ndiscovered what had occurred.",
    "When she did so  well  I do not\nthink she would prosecute the Comte.",
    "Too much would come out.",
    "He would have in his possession various letters of hers.",
    "Oh yes a\nvery safe scheme from the Comtes point of view  one that he has\nprobably carried out before.",
    "It seems clear enough yes said Van Aldin musingly.",
    "It accords with the personality of the Comte de la Roche said\nPoirot.",
    "Yes but now  Van Aldin looked searchingly at the other.",
    "What\nactually happened Tell me that M. Poirot.",
    "Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "It is quite simple he said someone stepped in ahead of the\nComte.",
    "There was a long pause.",
    "Van Aldin seemed to be turning things over in his mind.",
    "When he\nspoke it was without beating about the bush.",
    "How long have you suspected my soninlaw M. Poirot\n\nFrom the very first.",
    "He had the motive and the opportunity.",
    "Everyone took for granted that the man in Madames compartment\nin Paris was the Comte de la Roche.",
    "I thought so too.",
    "Then you\nhappened to mention that you had once mistaken the Comte for\nyour soninlaw.",
    "That told me that they were of the same height\nand build and alike in colouring.",
    "It put some curious ideas in my\nhead.",
    "The maid had only been with your daughter a short time.",
    "It\nwas unlikely that she would know Mr Kettering well by sight since\nhe had not been living in Curzon Street also the man was careful\nto keep his face turned away.",
    "You believe he  murdered her said Van Aldin hoarsely.",
    "Poirot raised a hand quickly.",
    "No no I did not say that  but it is a possibility  a very strong\npossibility.",
    "He was in a tight corner a very tight corner\nthreatened with ruin.",
    "This was the one way out.",
    "But why take the jewels\n\nTo make the crime appear an ordinary one committed by train\nrobbers.",
    "Otherwise suspicion might have fallen on him straight\naway.",
    "If that is so what has he done with the rubies\n\nThat remains to be seen.",
    "There are several possibilities.",
    "There is\na man in Nice who may be able to help the man I pointed out at\nthe tennis.",
    "He rose to his feet and Van Aldin rose also and laid his hand on the\nlittle mans shoulder.",
    "His voice when he spoke was harsh with emotion.",
    "Find Ruths murderer for me he said that is all I ask.",
    "Poirot drew himself up.",
    "Leave it in the hands of Hercule Poirot he said superbly have\nno fears.",
    "I will discover the truth.",
    "He brushed a speck of fluff from his hat smiled reassuringly at the\nmillionaire and left the room.",
    "Nevertheless as he went down the\nstairs some of the confidence faded from his face.",
    "It is all very well he murmured to himself but there are\ndifficulties.",
    "Yes there are great difficulties.",
    "As he was passing\n\n\fout of the hotel he came to a sudden halt.",
    "A car had drawn up in\nfront of the door.",
    "In it was Katherine Grey and Derek Kettering\nwas standing beside it talking to her earnestly.",
    "A minute or two later the car drove off and Derek remained\nstanding on the pavement looking after it.",
    "The expression on his\nface was an odd one.",
    "He gave a sudden impatient gesture of the\nshoulders sighed deeply and turned to find Hercule Poirot\nstanding at his elbow.",
    "In spite of himself he started.",
    "The two men\nlooked at each other.",
    "Poirot steadily and unwaveringly and Derek\nwith a kind of lighthearted defiance.",
    "There was a sneer behind\nthe easy mockery of his tone when he spoke raising his eyebrows\nslightly as he did so.",
    "Rather a dear isnt she he asked easily.",
    "His manner was perfectly natural.",
    "Yes said Poirot thoughtfully that describes Mademoiselle\nKatherine very well.",
    "It is very English that phrase there and\nMademoiselle Katherine she also is very English.",
    "Derek remained perfectly still without answering.",
    "And yet she is sympathique is it not so\n\nYes said Derek there are not many like her.",
    "He spoke softly almost as though to himself.",
    "Poirot nodded\nsignificantly.",
    "Then he leant towards the other and spoke in a\n\n\fdifferent tone a quiet grave tone that was new to Derek\nKettering.",
    "You will pardon an old man Monsieur if he says to you something\nthat you may consider impertinent.",
    "There is one of your English\nproverbs that I would quote to you.",
    "It says that it is well to be off\nwith the old love before being on with the new.",
    "Kettering turned on him angrily.",
    "What the devil do you mean\n\nYou enrage yourself at me said Poirot placidly.",
    "I expected as\nmuch.",
    "As to what I mean  I mean Monsieur that there is a second\ncar with a lady in it.",
    "If you turn your head you will see her.",
    "Derek spun around.",
    "His face darkened with anger.",
    "Mirelle damn her he muttered.",
    "I will soon \n\nPoirot arrested the movement he was about to make.",
    "Is it wise what you are about to do there he asked warningly.",
    "His eyes shone brightly with a green light in them.",
    "But Derek was\npast noticing the warning signs.",
    "In his manner he was completely\noff his guard.",
    "I have broken with her utterly and she knows it cried Derek\nangrily.",
    "You have broken with her yes but has she broken with you\n\n\fDerek gave a sudden harsh laugh.",
    "She wont break with two million pounds if she can help it he\nmurmured brutally trust Mirelle for that.",
    "Poirot raised his eyebrows.",
    "You have the outlook cynical he murmured.",
    "Have I There was no mirth in his sudden wide smile.",
    "I have\nlived in the world long enough M. Poirot to know that all women\nare pretty much alike.",
    "His face softened suddenly.",
    "All save one.",
    "He met Poirots gaze defiantly.",
    "A look of alertness crept into his\neyes then faded again.",
    "That one he said and jerked his head in\nthe direction of Cap Martin.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "This quiescence was well calculated to provoke the impetuous\ntemperament of the other.",
    "I know what you are going to say said Derek rapidly the kind\nof life I have led the fact that I am not worthy of her.",
    "You will say\nthat I have no right to think even of such a thing.",
    "You will say that it\nis not a case of giving a dog a bad name  I know that it is not\ndecent to be speaking like this with my wife dead only a few days\nand murdered at that.",
    "He paused for breath and Poirot took advantage of the pause to\nremark in his plaintive tone.",
    "But indeed I have not said anything at all.",
    "But you will.",
    "Eh said Poirot.",
    "You will say that I have no earthly chance of marrying Katherine.",
    "No said Poirot I would not say that.",
    "Your reputation is bad\nyes but with women  never does that deter them.",
    "If you were a\nman of excellent character of strict morality who had done\nnothing that he should not do and  possibly everything that he\nshould do  eh bien then I should have grave doubts of your\nsuccess.",
    "Moral worth you understand it is not romantic.",
    "It is\nappreciated however by widows.",
    "Derek Kettering stared at him then he swung round on his heel\nand went up to the waiting car.",
    "Poirot looked after him with some interest.",
    "He saw the lovely\nvision lean out of the car and speak.",
    "Derek Kettering did not stop.",
    "He lifted his hat and passed straight\non.",
    "\u00c7a y est said M. Hercule Poirot it is time I think that I return\nchez moi.",
    "He found the imperturbable George pressing trousers.",
    "A pleasant day Georges somewhat fatiguing but not without\ninterest he said.",
    "George received these remarks in his usual wooden fashion.",
    "Indeed sir.",
    "The personality of a criminal Georges is an interesting matter.",
    "Many murderers are men of great personal charm.",
    "I always heard sir that Dr Crippen was a pleasantspoken\ngentleman.",
    "And yet he cut up his wife like so much mincemeat.",
    "Your instances are always apt Georges.",
    "The valet did not reply and at that moment the telephone rang.",
    "Poirot took up the receiver.",
    "Allo  allo  yes yes it is Hercule Poirot who speaks.",
    "This is Knighton.",
    "Will you hold the line a minute M. Poirot Mr\nVan Aldin would like to speak to you.",
    "There was a moments pause then the millionaires voice came\nthrough.",
    "Is that you M. Poirot I just wanted to tell you Mason came to me\nnow of her own accord.",
    "She has been thinking it over and she\nsays that she is almost certain that the man at Paris was Derek\nKettering.",
    "There was something familiar about him at the time she\nsays but at the minute she could not place it.",
    "She seems pretty\ncertain now.",
    "Ah said Poirot thank you M. Van Aldin.",
    "That advances us.",
    "He replaced the receiver and stood for a minute or two with a\nvery curious smile on his face.",
    "George had to speak to him twice\nbefore obtaining an answer.",
    "Eh said Poirot.",
    "What is that that you say to me\n\nAre you lunching here sir or are you going out\n\nNeither said Poirot I shall go to bed and take a tisane.",
    "The\nexpected has happened and when the expected happens it\nalways causes me emotion.",
    "Chapter 25\n\nDEFIANCE\n\nAs Derek Kettering passed the car Mirelle leant out.",
    "Dereek  I must speak to you for a moment \n\n\fBut lifting his hat Derek passed straight on without stopping.",
    "When he got back to his hotel the concierge detached himself\nfrom his wooden pen and accosted him.",
    "A gentleman is waiting to see you Monsieur.",
    "Who is it asked Derek.",
    "He did not give me his name Monsieur but he said his business\nwith you was important and that he would wait.",
    "Where is he\n\nIn the little salon Monsieur.",
    "He preferred it to the lounge he said\nas being more private.",
    "Derek nodded and turned his steps in that direction.",
    "The small salon was empty except for the visitor who rose and\nbowed with easy foreign grace as Derek entered.",
    "As it chanced\nDerek had only seen the Comte de la Roche once but found no\ndifficulty in recognizing that aristocratic nobleman and he\nfrowned angrily.",
    "Of all the consummate impertinence\n\nThe Comte de la Roche is it not he said.",
    "I am afraid you have\nwasted your time in coming here.",
    "I hope not said the Comte agreeably.",
    "His white teeth glittered.",
    "The Comtes charm of manner was usually wasted on his own sex.",
    "All men without exception disliked him heartily.",
    "Derek Kettering\nwas already conscious of a distinct longing to kick the Count\nbodily out of the room.",
    "It was only the realization that scandal\nwould be unfortunate just at present that restrained him.",
    "He\nmarveled anew that Ruth could have cared as she certainly had\nfor this fellow.",
    "A bounder and worse than a bounder.",
    "He looked\nwith distaste at the Counts exquisitely manicured hands.",
    "I called said the Comte on a little matter of business.",
    "It would\nbe advisable I think for you to listen to me.",
    "Again Derek felt strongly tempted to kick him out but again he\nrefrained.",
    "The hint of a threat was not lost upon him but he\ninterpreted it in his own way.",
    "There were various reasons why it\nwould be better to hear what the Comte had to say.",
    "He sat down and drummed impatiently with his fingers on the\ntable.",
    "Well he said sharply what is it\n\nIt was not the Comtes way to come out into the open at once.",
    "Allow me Monsieur to offer you my condolences on your recent\nbereavement.",
    "If I have any impertinence from you said Derek quietly you go\nout by that window.",
    "He nodded his head towards the window beside the Comte and\nthe latter moved uneasily.",
    "I will send my friends to you Monsieur if that is what you desire\nhe said haughtily.",
    "Derek laughed.",
    "A duel eh My dear Count I dont take you seriously enough for\nthat.",
    "But I should take a good deal of pleasure in kicking you down\nthe Promenade des Anglais.",
    "The Comte was not at all anxious to take offence.",
    "He merely raised\nhis eyebrows and murmured\n\nThe English are barbarians.",
    "Well said Derek what is it you have to say to me\n\nI will be frank said the Comte I will come immediately to the\npoint.",
    "That will suit us both will it not\n\nAgain he smiled in his agreeable fashion.",
    "Go on said Derek curtly.",
    "The Comte looked at the ceiling joined the tips of his fingers\ntogether and murmured softly\n\nYou have come into a lot of money Monsieur.",
    "What the devil has that got to do with you\n\nThe Comte drew himself up.",
    "Monsieur my name is tarnished I am suspected  accused  of\nfoul crime.",
    "The accusation does not come from me said Derek coldly as\nan interested party I have not expressed any opinion.",
    "I am innocent said the Comte I swear before heaven  he\nraised his hand to heaven  that I am innocent.",
    "M. Carrege is I believe the Juge dInstruction in charge of the\ncase hinted Derek politely.",
    "The Comte took no notice.",
    "Not only am I unjustly suspected of a crime that I did not commit\nbut I am also in serious need of money.",
    "He coughed softly and suggestively.",
    "Derek rose to his feet.",
    "I was waiting for that he said softly you blackmailing brute I\nwill not give you a penny.",
    "My wife is dead and no scandal that you\ncan make can touch her now.",
    "She wrote you foolish letters I dare\nsay.",
    "If I were to buy them from you for a round sum at this minute I\nam pretty certain that you would manage to keep one or two back\nand I will tell you this M. de la Roche blackmailing is an ugly word\nboth in England and in France.",
    "That is my answer to you.",
    "Good\nafternoon.",
    "One moment  the Comte stretched out a hand as Derek was\nturning to leave the room.",
    "You are mistaken Monsieur.",
    "You are\ncompletely mistaken.",
    "I am I hope a gentleman.",
    "Derek laughed.",
    "Any letters that a lady might write to me I should hold sacred.",
    "He\nflung back his head with a beautiful air of nobility.",
    "The\nproposition that I was putting before you was of quite a different\nnature.",
    "I am as I said extremely short of money and my\nconscience might impel me to go to the police with certain\ninformation.",
    "Derek came slowly back into the room.",
    "What do you mean\n\nThe Comtes agreeable smile flashed forth once more.",
    "Surely it is not necessary to go into details he purred.",
    "Seek\nwhom the crime benefits they say dont they As I said just now\nyou have come into a lot of money lately.",
    "Derek laughed.",
    "If that is all  he said contemptuously.",
    "But the Comte was shaking his head.",
    "But it is not all my dear sir.",
    "I should not come to you unless I had much more precise and\ndetailed information than that.",
    "It is not agreeable Monsieur to be\narrested and tried for murder.",
    "Derek came close up to him.",
    "His face expressed such furious\nanger that involuntarily the Comte drew back a pace or two.",
    "Are you threatening me the young man demanded angrily.",
    "You shall hear nothing more of the matter the Comte assured\nhim.",
    "Of all the colossal bluffs that I have ever struck \n\nThe Comte raised a white hand.",
    "You are wrong.",
    "It is not a bluff.",
    "To convince you I will tell you this.",
    "My information was obtained from a certain lady.",
    "It is she who\nholds the irrefutable proof that you committed the murder.",
    "She Who\n\n\fMademoiselle Mirelle.",
    "Derek drew back as though struck.",
    "Mirelle he muttered.",
    "The Comte was quick to press what he took to be his advantage.",
    "A bagatelle of one hundred thousand francs he said.",
    "I ask no\nmore.",
    "Eh said Derek absently.",
    "I was saying Monsieur that a bagatelle of one hundred thousand\nfrancs would satisfy my  conscience.",
    "Derek seemed to recollect himself.",
    "He looked earnestly at the\nComte.",
    "You would like my answer now\n\nIf you please Monsieur.",
    "Then here it is.",
    "You can go to the devil.",
    "See\n\nLeaving the Comte too astonished to speak Derek turned on his\nheel and swung out of the room.",
    "Once out of the hotel he hailed a taxi and drove to Mirelles hotel.",
    "On inquiring he learned that the dancer had just come in.",
    "Derek\ngave the concierge his card.",
    "Take this up to Mademoiselle and ask if she will see me.",
    "A very brief interval elapsed and then Derek was bidden to follow\na chasseur.",
    "A wave of exotic perfume assailed Dereks nostrils as he stepped\nover the threshold of the dancers apartments.",
    "The room was\nfilled with carnations orchids and mimosa.",
    "Mirelle was standing\nby the window in a peignoir of foamy lace.",
    "She came towards him her hands outstretched.",
    "Derek  you have come to me.",
    "I knew you would.",
    "He put aside the clinging arms and looked down on her sternly.",
    "Why did you send the Comte de la Roche to me\n\nShe looked at him in astonishment which he took to be genuine.",
    "I Send the Comte de la Roche to you But for what\n\nApparently  for blackmail said Derek grimly.",
    "Again she stared.",
    "Then suddenly she smiled and nodded her\nhead.",
    "Of course.",
    "It was to be expected.",
    "It is what he would do ce type\nl\u00e0.",
    "I might have known it.",
    "No indeed Dereek I did not send him.",
    "He looked at her piercingly as though seeking to read her mind.",
    "I will tell you said Mirelle.",
    "I am ashamed but I will tell you.",
    "The\nother day you comprehend I was mad with rage quite mad  she\nmade an eloquent gesture.",
    "My temperament it is not a patient\none.",
    "I want to be revenged on you and so I go to the Comte de la\nRoche and I tell him to go to the police and say so and so and so\nand so.",
    "But have no fear Dereek.",
    "Not completely did I lose my\nhead the proof rests with me alone.",
    "The police can do nothing\nwithout my word you understand And now  now\n\nShe nestled up close to him looking up at him with melting eyes.",
    "He thrust her roughly away from him.",
    "She stood there her breast\nheaving her eyes narrowing to a catlike slit.",
    "Be careful Dereek be very careful.",
    "You have come back to me\nhave you not\n\nI shall never come back to you said Derek steadily.",
    "Ah\n\nMore than ever the dancer looked like a cat.",
    "Her eyelids flickered.",
    "So there is another woman The one with whom you lunched that\nday.",
    "Eh am I right\n\nI intend to ask that lady to marry me.",
    "You might as well know.",
    "That prim Englishwoman Do you think that I will support that for\none moment Ah no.",
    "Her beautiful lithe body quivered.",
    "Listen Dereek do you remember that conversation we had in\nLondon You said the only thing that could save you was the death\nof your wife.",
    "You regretted that she was so healthy.",
    "Then the idea\nof an accident came to your brain.",
    "And more than an accident.",
    "I suppose said Derek contemptuously that it was this\nconversation that you repeated to the Comte de la Roche.",
    "Mirelle laughed.",
    "Am I a fool Could the police do anything with a vague story like\nthat See  I will give you a last chance.",
    "You shall give up this\nEnglishwoman.",
    "You shall return to me.",
    "And then cheri never\nnever will I breathe \n\nBreathe what\n\nShe laughed softly.",
    "You thought no one saw you \n\nWhat do you mean\n\n\fAs I say you thought no one saw you  but I saw you Dereek\nmon ami I saw you coming out of the compartment of Madame\nyour wife just before the train got into Lyons that night.",
    "And I know\nmore than that.",
    "I know that when you came out of her\ncompartment she was dead.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "Then like a man in a dream he turned very\nslowly and went out of the room swaying slightly as he walked.",
    "Chapter 26\n\nA WARNING\n\nAnd so it is said Poirot that we are the good friends and have\nno secrets from each other.",
    "Katherine turned her head to look at him.",
    "There was something in\nhis voice some undercurrent of seriousness which she had not\nheard before.",
    "They were sitting in the gardens of Monte Carlo.",
    "Katherine had\ncome over with her friends and they had run into Knighton and\nPoirot almost immediately on arrival.",
    "Lady Tamplin had seized\nupon Knighton and had overwhelmed him with reminiscences\nmost of which Katherine had a faint suspicion were invented.",
    "They\nhad moved away together Lady Tamplin with her hand on the\nyoung mans arm.",
    "Knighton had thrown a couple of glances back\n\n\fover his shoulder and Poirots eyes twinkled a little as he saw\nthem.",
    "Of course we are friends said Katherine.",
    "From the beginning we have been sympathetic to each other mused\nPoirot.",
    "When you told me that a roman policier occurs in real life.",
    "And I was right was I not he challenged her with an emphatic\nforefinger.",
    "Here we are plunged in the middle of one.",
    "That is natural\nfor me  it is my m\u00e9tier  but for you it is different.",
    "Yes he added in a\nreflective tone for you it is different.",
    "She looked sharply at him.",
    "It was as though he were warning her\npointing out to her some menace that she had not seen.",
    "Why do you say that I am in the middle of it It is true that I had that\nconversation with Mrs. Kettering just before she died but now  now\nall that is over.",
    "I am not connected with the case any more.",
    "Ah Mademoiselle Mademoiselle can we ever say I have finished\nwith this or that\n\nKatherine turned defiantly round to face him.",
    "What is it she asked.",
    "You are trying to tell me something  to\nconvey it to me rather.",
    "But I am not clever at taking hints.",
    "I would\nmuch rather that you said anything you have to say straight out.",
    "Poirot looked at her sadly.",
    "Ah mais cest anglais \u00e7a he murmured\neverything in black and white everything clear cut and well defined.",
    "But life it is not like that Mademoiselle.",
    "There are the things that are\nnot yet but which cast their shadow before.",
    "He dabbed his brow with a very large silk pockethandkerchief and\nmurmured Ah but it is that I become poetical.",
    "Let us as you say\nspeak only of facts.",
    "And speaking of facts tell me what you think of\nMajor Knighton.",
    "I like him very much indeed said Katherine warmly he is quite\ndelightful.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "What is the matter asked Katherine.",
    "You reply so heartily said Poirot.",
    "If you had said in an indifferent\nvoice Oh quite nice eh bien do you know I should have been better\npleased.",
    "Katharine did not answer.",
    "She felt slightly uncomfortable.",
    "Poirot went\non dreamily And yet who knows With les femmes they have so\nmany ways of concealing what they feel  and heartiness is perhaps as\ngood a way as any other.",
    "He sighed.",
    "I dont see  began Katherine.",
    "He interrupted her.",
    "You do not see why I am being so impertinent Mademoiselle I\nam an old man and now and then  not very often  I come across\nsomeone whose welfare is dear to me.",
    "We are friends\nMademoiselle.",
    "You have said so yourself.",
    "And it is just this  I\nshould like to see you happy.",
    "Katherine stared very straight in front of her.",
    "She had a cretonne\nsunshade with her and with its point she traced little designs in\nthe gravel at her feet.",
    "I have asked you a question about Major Knighton now I will ask\nyou another.",
    "Do you like Mr Derek Kettering\n\nI hardly know him said Katherine.",
    "That is not an answer that.",
    "I think it is.",
    "He looked at her struck by something in her tone.",
    "Then he\nnodded his head gravely and slowly.",
    "Perhaps you are right Mademoiselle.",
    "See you I who speak to\nyou have seen much of the world and I know that there are two\nthings which are true.",
    "A good man may be ruined by his love for a\nbad woman  but the other way holds good also.",
    "A bad man may\nequally be ruined by his love for a good woman.",
    "Katherine looked up sharply.",
    "When you say ruined \n\nI mean from his point of view.",
    "One must be wholehearted in crime\nas in everything else.",
    "You are trying to warn me said Katherine in a low voice.",
    "Against whom\n\nI cannot look into your heart Mademoiselle I do not think you\nwould let me if I could.",
    "I will just say this.",
    "There are men who have\na strange fascination for women.",
    "The Comte de la Roche said Katherine with a smile.",
    "There are others  more dangerous than the Comte de la Roche.",
    "They have qualities that appeal  recklessness daring audacity.",
    "You are fascinated Mademoiselle I see that but I think that it is\nno more than that.",
    "I hope so.",
    "This man of whom I speak the\nemotion he feels is genuine enough but all the same \n\nYes\n\nHe got up and stood looking down at her.",
    "Then he spoke in a low\ndistinct voice\n\nYou could perhaps love a thief Mademoiselle but not a\nmurderer.",
    "He wheeled sharply away on that and left her sitting there.",
    "He heard the little gasp she gave and paid no attention.",
    "He had\nsaid what he meant to say.",
    "He left her there to digest that last\nunmistakable phrase.",
    "Derek Kettering coming out of the Casino into the sunshine saw\nher sitting alone on the bench and joined her.",
    "I have been gambling he said with a light laugh gambling\nunsuccessfully.",
    "I have lost everything  everything that is that I\nhave with me.",
    "Katherine looked at him with a troubled face.",
    "She was aware at\nonce of something new in his manner some hidden excitement\nthat betrayed itself in a hundred different infinitesimal signs.",
    "I should think you were always a gambler.",
    "The spirit of gambling\nappeals to you.",
    "Every day and in every way a gambler You are about right.",
    "Dont\nyou find something stimulating in it To risk all on one throw there is nothing like it.",
    "Calm and stolid as she believed herself to be Katherine felt a faint\nanswering thrill.",
    "I want to talk to you went on Derek and who knows when I may\nhave another opportunity There is an idea going about that I\n\n\fmurdered my wife  no please dont interrupt.",
    "It is absurd of\ncourse.",
    "He paused for a minute or two then went on speaking\nmore deliberately.",
    "In dealing with the police and Local\nAuthorities here I have had to pretend to  well  a certain\ndecency.",
    "I prefer not to pretend with you.",
    "I meant to marry money.",
    "I was on the look out for money when I first met Ruth Van Aldin.",
    "She had the look of a slim Madonna about her and I  well  I made\nall sorts of good resolutions  and was bitterly disillusioned.",
    "My\nwife was in love with another man when she married me.",
    "She\nnever cared for me in the least.",
    "Oh I am not complaining the\nthing was a perfectly respectable bargain.",
    "She wanted Leconbury\nand I wanted money.",
    "The trouble arose simply through Ruths\nAmerican blood.",
    "Without caring a pin for me she would have liked\nme to be continually dancing attendance.",
    "Time and again she as\ngood as told me that she had bought me and that I belonged to\nher.",
    "The result was that I behaved abominably to her.",
    "My fatherinlaw will tell you that and he is quite right.",
    "At the time of Ruths\ndeath I was faced with absolute disaster.",
    "He laughed suddenly.",
    "One is faced with absolute disaster when one is up against a man\nlike Rufus Van Aldin.",
    "And then asked Katherine in a low voice.",
    "And then Derek shrugged his shoulders Ruth was murdered very providentially.",
    "He laughed and the sound of his laugh hurt Katherine.",
    "She\nwinced.",
    "Yes said Derek.",
    "that wasnt in very good taste.",
    "But it is quite\ntrue.",
    "Now I am going to tell you something more.",
    "From the very\nfirst moment I saw you I knew you were the only woman in the\nworld for me.",
    "I was  afraid of you.",
    "I thought you might bring me\nbad luck.",
    "Bad luck said Katherine sharply.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "Why do you repeat it like that What have you\ngot in your mind\n\nI was thinking of things that people have said to me.",
    "Derek grinned suddenly.",
    "They will say a lot to you about me my\ndear and most of it will be true.",
    "Yes and worse things too  things\nthat I shall never tell you.",
    "I have been a gambler always  and I\nhave taken some long odds.",
    "I shant confess to you now or at any\nother time.",
    "The past is done with.",
    "There is one thing I do wish you\nto believe.",
    "I swear to you solemnly that I did not kill my wife.",
    "He said the words earnestly enough yet there was somehow a\ntheatrical touch about them.",
    "He met her troubled gaze and went\non\n\nI know.",
    "I lied the other day.",
    "It was my wifes compartment I went\ninto.",
    "Ah said Katherine.",
    "Its difficult to explain just why I went in but Ill try.",
    "I did it on an\nimpulse.",
    "You see I was more or less spying on my wife.",
    "I kept out\nof sight on the train.",
    "Mirelle had told me that my wife was meeting\nthe Comte de la Roche in Paris.",
    "Well as far as I had seen that was\nnot so.",
    "I felt ashamed and I thought suddenly that it would be a\ngood thing to have it out with her once and for all so I pushed\nopen the door and went in.",
    "He paused.",
    "Yes said Katherine gently.",
    "Ruth was lying on the bunk asleep  her face was turned away\nfrom me  I could only see the back of her head.",
    "I could have\nwaked her up of course.",
    "But suddenly I felt a reaction.",
    "What after\nall was there to say that we hadnt both of us said a hundred times\nbefore She looked so peaceful lying there.",
    "I left the compartment\nas quietly as I could.",
    "Why lie about it to the police asked Katherine.",
    "Because Im not a complete fool.",
    "Ive realized from the beginning\nthat from the point of view of motive Im the ideal murderer.",
    "If I\nonce admitted that I had been in her compartment just before she\nwas murdered Id do for myself once and for all.",
    "I see.",
    "Did she see She could not have told herself.",
    "She was feeling the\nmagnetic attraction of Dereks personality but there was\nsomething in her that resisted that held back...\n\nKatherine \n\nYes\n\nYou know that I care for you.",
    "Do  do you care for me\n\nI  I dont know.",
    "Weakness there.",
    "Either she knew or she did not know.",
    "If  if only \n\nShe cast a look round desperately as though seeking something\nthat would help her.",
    "A soft colour rose in her cheeks as a tall fair\nman with a limp came hurrying along the path towards them Major Knighton.",
    "There was relief and an unexpected warmth in her voice as she\ngreeted him.",
    "Derek stood up scowling his face black as a thundercloud.",
    "Lady Tamplin having a flutter he said easily.",
    "I must join her\nand give her the benefit of my system.",
    "He swung round on his heel and left them together.",
    "Katherine sat\ndown again.",
    "Her heart was beating rapidly and unevenly but as\nshe sat there talking commonplaces to the quiet rather shy man\nbeside her her selfcommand came back.",
    "Then she realized with a shock that Knighton also was laying bare\nhis heart much as Derek had done but in a very different manner.",
    "He was shy and stammering.",
    "The words came haltingly with no\neloquence to back them.",
    "From the first moment I saw you  I  I ought not to have spoken so\nsoon  but Mr Van Aldin may leave here any day and I might not\nhave another chance.",
    "I know you cant care for me so soon  that\nis impossible.",
    "I dare say it is presumption anyway on my part.",
    "I\nhave private means but not very much  no please dont answer\nnow.",
    "I know what your answer would be.",
    "But in case I went away\nsuddenly I just wanted you to know  that I care.",
    "She was shaken  touched.",
    "His manner was so gentle and\nappealing.",
    "Theres one thing more.",
    "I just wanted to say that if  if you are\never in trouble anything that I can do \n\nHe took her hand in his held it tightly for a minute then dropped it\nand walked rapidly away towards the Casino without looking\nback.",
    "Katherine sat perfectly still looking after him.",
    "Derek Kettering Richard Knighton  two men so different  so very different.",
    "There\nwas something kind about Knighton kind and trustworthy.",
    "As to\nDerek  Then suddenly Katherine had a very curious sensation.",
    "She felt that she was no longer sitting alone on the seat in the\nCasino gardens but that someone was standing beside her and\nthat that someone was the dead woman Ruth Kettering.",
    "She had\na further impression that Ruth wanted  badly  to tell her\nsomething.",
    "The impression was so curious so vivid that it could\nnot be driven away.",
    "She felt absolutely certain that the spirit of\nRuth Kettering was trying to convey something of vital importance\nto her.",
    "The impression faded.",
    "Katherine got up trembling a little.",
    "What was it that Ruth Kettering had wanted so badly to say\n\nChapter 27\n\nINTERVIEW WITH MIRELLE\n\nWhen Knighton left Katherine he went in search of Hercule Poirot\nwhom he found in the Rooms jauntily placing the minimum stake\non the even numbers.",
    "As Knighton joined him the number thirtythree turned up and Poirots stake was swept away.",
    "Bad luck said Knighton are you going to stake again\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "Not at present.",
    "Do you feel the fascination of gambling asked Knighton\ncuriously.",
    "Not at roulette.",
    "Knighton shot a swift glance at him.",
    "His own face became\ntroubled.",
    "He spoke haltingly with a touch of deference.",
    "I wonder are you busy M. Poirot There is something I would like\nto ask you about.",
    "I am at your disposal.",
    "Shall we go outside It is pleasant in the\nsunshine.",
    "They strolled out together and Knighton drew a deep breath.",
    "I love the Riviera he said.",
    "I came here first twelve years ago\nduring the war when I was sent to Lady Tamplins Hospital.",
    "It was\nlike Paradise coming from Flanders to this.",
    "It must have been said Poirot.",
    "How long ago the war seems now mused Knighton.",
    "They walked on in silence for some little way.",
    "You have something on your mind said Poirot.",
    "Knighton looked at him in some surprise.",
    "You are quite right he confessed.",
    "I dont know how you knew\nit though.",
    "It showed itself only too plainly said Poirot drily.",
    "I did not know that I was so transparent.",
    "It is my business to observe the physiognomy the little man\nexplained with dignity.",
    "I will tell you M. Poirot.",
    "You have heard of this dancer woman Mirelle\n\nShe who is the ch\u00e8re amie of M. Derek Kettering\n\nYes that is the one and knowing this you will understand that\nMr. Van Aldin is naturally prejudiced against her.",
    "She wrote to\nhim asking for an interview.",
    "He told me to dictate a curt refusal\nwhich of course I did.",
    "This morning she came to the hotel and sent\nup her card saying that it was urgent and vital that she should see\nMr. Van Aldin at once.",
    "You interest me said Poirot.",
    "Mr. Van Aldin was furious.",
    "He told me what message to send\ndown to her.",
    "I ventured to disagree with him.",
    "It seemed to me both\nlikely and probable that this woman Mirelle might give us valuable\ninformation.",
    "We know that she was on the Blue Train and she may\n\n\fhave seen or heard something that it might be vital for us to know.",
    "Dont you agree with me M. Poirot\n\nI do said Poicot drily.",
    "M. Van Aldin if I may say so behaved\nexceedingly foolishly.",
    "I am glad you take that view of the matter said the secretary.",
    "Now I am going to tell you something M. Poirot.",
    "So strongly did I\nfeel the unwisdom of Mr. Van Aidins attitude that I went down\nprivately and had an interview with the lady.",
    "Eh bien\n\nThe difficulty was that she insisted on seeing Mr Van Aldin\nhimself.",
    "I softened his message as much as I possibly could.",
    "In\nfact  to be candid  I gave it in a very different form.",
    "I said that Mr\nVan Aldin was too busy to see her at present but that she might\nmake any communication she wished to me.",
    "That however she\ncould not bring herself to do and she left without saying anything\nfurther.",
    "But I have a strong impression M. Poirot that that woman\nknows something.",
    "This is serious said Poirot quietly.",
    "You know where she is\nstaying\n\nYes.",
    "Knighton mentioned the name of the hotel.",
    "Good said Poirot we will go there immediately.",
    "The secretary looked doubtful.",
    "And Mr Van Aldin he queried doubtfully.",
    "M. Van Aldin is an obstinate man said Poirot drily.",
    "I do not\nargue with obstinate men.",
    "I act in spite of them.",
    "We will go and see\nthe lady immediately.",
    "I will tell her that you are empowered by M.\nVan Aldin to act for him and you will guard yourself well from\ncontradicting me.",
    "Knighton still looked slightly doubtful but Poirot took no notice of\nhis hesitation.",
    "At the hotel they were told that Mademoiselle was in and Poirot\nsent up both his and Knightons cards with From Mr Van Aldin\npencilled upon them.",
    "Word came down that Mademoiselle Mirelle would receive them.",
    "When they were ushered into the dancers apartments Poirot\nimmediately took the lead.",
    "Mademoiselle he murmured bowing very low we are here on\nbehalf of M. Van Aldin.",
    "Ah And why did he not come himself\n\nHe is indisposed said Poirot mendaciously the Riviera throat\nit has him in its grip but me I am empowered to act for him as is\nMajor Knighton his secretary.",
    "Unless of course Mademoiselle\nwould prefer to wait a fortnight or so.",
    "If there was one thing of which Poirot was tolerably certain it was\nthat to a temperament such as Mirelles the mere word wait was\nanathema.",
    "Eh bien I will speak Messieurs she cried.",
    "I have been patient.",
    "I have held my hand.",
    "And for what That I should be insulted Yes\ninsulted Ah Does he think to treat Mirelle like that To throw her\noff like an old glove.",
    "I tell you never has a man tired of me.",
    "Always\nit is I who tire of them.",
    "She paced up and down the room her slender body trembling\nwith rage.",
    "A small table impeded her free passage and she flung it\nfrom her into a corner where it splintered against the wall.",
    "That is what I will do to him she cried and that\n\nPicking up a glass bowl filled with lilies she flung it into the grate\nwhere it smashed into a hundred pieces.",
    "Knighton was looking at her with cold British disapproval.",
    "He felt\nembarrassed and ill at ease.",
    "Poirot on the other hand with\ntwinkling eyes was thoroughly enjoying the scene.",
    "Ah it is magnificent he cried.",
    "It can be seen  Madame has a\ntemperament.",
    "I am an artist said Mirelle every artist has a temperament.",
    "I\ntold Dereek to beware and he would not listen.",
    "She whirled\n\n\fround on Poirot suddenly.",
    "It is true is it not that he wants to\nmarry that English miss\n\nPoirot coughed.",
    "On ma dit he murmured that he adores her passionately.",
    "Mirelle came towards them.",
    "He murdered his wife she screamed.",
    "There  now you have it\nHe told me beforehand that he meant to do it.",
    "He had got to an\nimpasse  zut he took the easiest way out.",
    "You say that M. Kettering murdered his wife.",
    "Yes yes yes.",
    "Have I not told you so\n\nThe police murmured Poirot will need proof of that  er statement.",
    "I tell you I saw him come out of her compartment that night on the\ntrain.",
    "When asked Poirot sharply.",
    "Just before the train reached Lyons.",
    "You will swear to that Mademoiselle\n\nIt was a different Poirot who spoke now sharp and decisive.",
    "Yes.",
    "There was a moments silence.",
    "Mirelle was panting and her eyes\nhalf defiant half frightened went from the face of one man to the\nother.",
    "This is a serious matter Mademoiselle said the detective.",
    "You\nrealize how serious\n\nCertainly I do.",
    "That is well said Poirot.",
    "Then you understand Mademoiselle\nthat no time must be lost.",
    "You will perhaps accompany us\nimmediately to the office of the Examining Magistrate.",
    "Mirelle was taken aback.",
    "She hesitated but as Poirot had\nforeseen she had no loophole for escape.",
    "Very well she muttered.",
    "I will fetch a coat.",
    "Left alone together Poirot and Knighton exchanged glances.",
    "It is necessary to act while  how do you say it  the iron is hot\nmurmured Poirot.",
    "She is temperamental in an hours time\nmaybe she will repent and she will wish to draw back.",
    "We must\nprevent that at all costs.",
    "Mirelle reappeared wrapped in a sandcoloured velvet wrap\ntrimmed with leopard skin.",
    "She looked not altogether unlike a\n\n\fleopardess tawny and dangerous.",
    "Her eyes still flashed with\nanger and determination.",
    "They found M. Caux and the Examining Magistrate together.",
    "A few\nbrief introductory words from Poirot and Mademoiselle Mirelle\nwas courteously entreated to tell her tale.",
    "This she did in much the\nsame words as she had done to Knighton and Poirot though with\nfar more soberness of manner.",
    "This is an extraordinary story Mademoiselle said M. Carrege\nslowly.",
    "He leant back in his chair adjusted his pincenez and\nlooked keenly and searchingly at the dancer through them.",
    "You wish us to believe M. Kettering actually boasted of the crime\nto you beforehand\n\nYes yes.",
    "She was too healthy he said.",
    "If she were to die it must\nbe an accident  he would arrange it all.",
    "You are aware Mademoiselle said M. Carrege sternly that you\nare making yourself out to be an accessory before the fact\n\nMe But not the least in the world Monsieur.",
    "Not for a moment\ndid I take that statement seriously.",
    "Ah no indeed I know men\nMonsieur they say many wild things.",
    "It would be an odd state of\naffairs if one were to take all they said au pied de la lettre.",
    "The Examining Magistrate raised his eyebrows.",
    "We are to take it then that you regarded M. Ketterings threats\nas mere idle words May I ask Mademoiselle what made you\nthrow up your engagements in London and come out to the\nRiviera\n\nMirelle looked at him with melting black eyes.",
    "I wished to be with the man I loved she said simply.",
    "Was it so\nunnatural\n\nPoirot interpolated a question gently.",
    "Was it then at M. Ketterings wish that you accompanied him to\nNice\n\nMirelle seemed to find a little difficulty in answering this.",
    "She\nhesitated perceptibly before she spoke.",
    "When she did it was with\na haughty indifference of manner.",
    "In such matters I please myself Monsieur she said.",
    "That the answer was not an answer at all was noted by all three\nmen.",
    "They said nothing.",
    "When were you first convinced that M. Kettering had murdered\nhis wife\n\nAs I tell you Monsieur I saw M. Kettering come out of his wifes\ncompartment just before the train drew into Lyons.",
    "There was a\n\n\flook on his face  ah at the moment I could not understand it  a\nlook haunted and terrible.",
    "I shall never forget it.",
    "Her voice rose shrilly and she flung out her arms in an\nextravagant gesture.",
    "Quite so said M. Carrege.",
    "Afterwards when I found that Madame Kettering was dead when\nthe train left Lyons then  then I knew\n\nAnd still  you did not go to the police Mademoiselle said the\nCommissary mildly.",
    "Mirelle glanced at him superbly she was clearly enjoying herself\nin the role she was playing.",
    "Shall I betray my lover she asked.",
    "Ah no do not ask a woman\nto do that.",
    "Yet now  hinted M. Caux.",
    "Now it is different.",
    "He has betrayed me Shall I suffer that in\nsilence\n\nThe Examining Magistrate checked her.",
    "Quite so quite so he murmured soothingly.",
    "And now Mademoiselle perhaps you will read over the\nstatement of what you have told us see that it is correct and sign\nit.",
    "Mirelle wasted no time on the document.",
    "Yes yes she said it is correct.",
    "She rose to her feet.",
    "You\nrequire me no longer Messieurs\n\nAt present no Mademoiselle.",
    "And Dereek will be arrested\n\nAt once Mademoiselle.",
    "Mirelle laughed cruelly and drew her fur draperies closer about\nher.",
    "He should have thought of this before he insulted me she cried.",
    "There is one little matter  Poirot coughed apologetically  just a\nmatter of detail.",
    "Yes\n\nWhat makes you think Madame Kettering was dead when the\ntrain left Lyons\n\nMirelle stared.",
    "But she was dead.",
    "Was she\n\nYes of course.",
    "I \n\nShe came to an abrupt stop.",
    "Poirot was regarding her intently\nand he saw the wary look that came into her eyes.",
    "I have been told so.",
    "Everybody says so.",
    "Oh said Poirot I was not aware that the fact had been\nmentioned outside the Examining Magistrates office.",
    "Mirelle appeared somewhat discomposed.",
    "One hears those things she said vaguely they get about.",
    "Somebody told me.",
    "I cant remember who it was.",
    "She moved to the door.",
    "M. Caux sprang forward to open it for her\nand as he did so Poirots voice rose gently once more.",
    "And the jewels Pardon Mademoiselle.",
    "Can you tell me anything\nabout those\n\nThe jewels What jewels\n\nThe rubies of Katherine the Great.",
    "Since you hear so much you\nmust have heard of them.",
    "I know nothing about any jewels said Mirelle sharply.",
    "She went out closing the door behind her.",
    "M. Caux came back to\nhis chair the Examining Magistrate sighed.",
    "What a fury he said but diablement chic.",
    "I wonder if she is\ntelling the truth I think so.",
    "There is some truth in her story certainly said Poirot.",
    "We have\nconfirmation of it from Miss Grey.",
    "She was looking down the\ncorridor a short time before the train reached Lyons and she saw\nM. Kettering go into his wifes compartment.",
    "The case against him seems quite clear said the Commissary\nsighing it is a thousand pities he murmured.",
    "How do you mean asked Poirot.",
    "It has been the ambition of my life to lay the Comte de la Roche by\nthe heels.",
    "This time ma foi I thought we had got him.",
    "This other it is not nearly so satisfactory.",
    "M. Carrege rubbed his nose.",
    "If anything goes wrong he observed cautiously it will be most\nawkward.",
    "M. Kettering is of the aristocracy.",
    "It will get into the\nnewspapers.",
    "If we have made a mistake  He shrugged his\nshoulders forebodingly.",
    "The jewels now said the Commissary what do you think he has\ndone with them\n\nHe took them for a plant of course said M. Carrege they must\nhave been a great inconvenience to him and very awkward to\ndispose of.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "I have an idea of my own about the jewels.",
    "Tell me Messieurs\nwhat do you know of a man called the Marquis\n\nThe Commissary leant forward excitedly.",
    "The Marquis he said the Marquis Do you think he is mixed up\nin this affair M. Poirot\n\nI ask you what you know of him.",
    "The Commissary made an expressive grimace.",
    "Not as much as we should like to he observed ruefully.",
    "He\nworks behind the scenes you understand.",
    "He has underlings who\ndo his dirty work for him.",
    "But he is someone high up.",
    "That we are\nsure of.",
    "He does not come from the criminal classes.",
    "A Frenchman\n\nYes.",
    "At least we believe so.",
    "But we are not sure.",
    "He has worked\nin France in England in America.",
    "There was a series of robberies\n\n\fin Switzerland last autumn which were laid at his door.",
    "By all\naccounts he is a grand seigneur speaking French and English\nwith equal perfection and his origin is a mystery.",
    "Poirot nodded and rose to take his departure.",
    "Can you tell us nothing more M. Poirot urged the Commissary.",
    "At present no said Poirot but I may have news awaiting me at\nmy hotel.",
    "M. Carrege looked uncomfortable.",
    "If the Marquis is concerned in\nthis  he began and then stopped.",
    "It upsets our ideas complained M. Caux.",
    "It does not upset mine said Poirot.",
    "On the contrary I think it\nagrees with them very well.",
    "Au revoir Messieurs if news of any\nimportance\n\ncomes\n\nto\n\nme\n\nI\n\nwill\n\ncommunicate\n\nit\n\nto\n\nyou\n\nimmediately.",
    "He walked back to his hotel with a grave face.",
    "In his absence a\ntelegram had come to him.",
    "Taking a papercutter from his pocket\nhe slit it open.",
    "It was a long telegram and he read it over twice\nbefore slowly putting it in his pocket.",
    "Upstairs George was\nawaiting his master.",
    "I am fatigued Georges much fatigued.",
    "Will you order for me a\nsmall pot of chocolate\n\n\fThe chocolate was duly ordered and brought and George set it at\nthe little table at his masters elbow.",
    "As he was preparing to retire\nPoirot spoke\n\nI believe Georges that you have a good knowledge of the\nEnglish aristocracy murmured Poirot.",
    "George smiled apologetically.",
    "I think that I might say that I have sir he replied.",
    "I suppose that it is your opinion Georges that criminals are\ninvariably drawn from the lower orders.",
    "Not always sir.",
    "There was great trouble with one of the Duke of\nDevizes younger sons.",
    "He left Eton under a cloud and after that\nhe caused great anxiety on several occasions.",
    "The police would\nnot accept the view that it was kleptomania.",
    "A very clever young\ngentleman sir but vicious through and through if you take my\nmeaning.",
    "His Grace shipped him to Australia and I hear he was\nconvicted out there under another name.",
    "Very odd sir but there it\nis.",
    "The young gentleman I need hardly say was not in want\nfinancially.",
    "Poirot nodded his head slowly.",
    "Love of excitement he murmured and a little kink in the brain\nsomewhere.",
    "I wonder now \n\nHe drew out the telegram from his pocket and read it again.",
    "Then there was Lady Mary Foxs daughter continued the valet in\na mood of reminiscence.",
    "Swindled tradespeople something\nshocking she did.",
    "Very worrying to the best families if I may say\nso and there are many other queer cases I could mention.",
    "You have a wide experience Georges murmured Poirot.",
    "I often\nwonder having lived so exclusively with titled families that you\ndemean yourself by coming as a valet to me.",
    "I put it down to love\nof excitement on your part.",
    "Not exactly sir said George.",
    "I happened to see in Society\nSnippets that you had been received at Buckingham Palace.",
    "That\nwas just when I was looking for a new situation.",
    "His Majesty so it\nsaid had been most gracious and friendly and thought very highly\nof your abilities.",
    "Ah said Poirot one always likes to know the reason for\nthings.",
    "He remained in thought for a few moments and then said\n\nYou rang up Mademoiselle Papopolous\n\nYes sir she and her father will be pleased to dine with you\ntonight.",
    "Ah said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "He drank off his chocolate set the\ncup and saucer neatly in the middle of the tray and spoke gently\nmore to himself than to the valet.",
    "The squirrel my good Georges collects nuts.",
    "He stores them up\nin the autumn so that they may be of advantage to him later.",
    "To\nmake a success of humanity Georges we must profit by the\nlessons of those below us in the animal kingdom.",
    "I have always\ndone so.",
    "I have been the cat watching at the mouse hole.",
    "I have\nbeen the good dog following up the scent and not taking my nose\nfrom the trail.",
    "And also my good Georges I have been the\nsquirrel.",
    "I have stored away the little fact here the little fact there.",
    "I go now to my store and I take out one particular nut a nut that I\nstored away  let me see seventeen years ago.",
    "You follow me\nGeorges\n\nI should hardly have thought sir said George that nuts would\nhave kept so long as that though I know one can do wonders with\npreserving bottles.",
    "Poirot looked at him and smiled.",
    "Chapter 28\n\nPOIROT PLAYS THE SQUIRREL\n\nPoirot started to keep his dinner appointment with a margin of\nthree quarters of an hour to spare.",
    "He had an object in this.",
    "The\ncar took him not straight to Monte Carlo but to Lady Tamplins\nhouse at Cap Martin where he asked for Miss Grey.",
    "The ladies\nwere dressing and Poirot was shown into a small salon to wait\n\n\fand here after a lapse of three or four minutes Lenox Tamplin\ncame to him.",
    "Katherine is not quite ready yet she said.",
    "Can I give her a\nmessage or would you rather wait until she comes down\n\nPoirot looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "He was a minute or two in\nreplying as though something of great weight hung upon his\ndecision.",
    "Apparently the answer to such a simple question\nmattered.",
    "No he said at last no I do not think it is necessary that I should\nwait to see Mademoiselle Katherine.",
    "I think perhaps that it is\nbetter that I should not.",
    "These things are sometimes difficult.",
    "Lenox waited politely her eyebrows slightly raised.",
    "I have a piece of news continued Poirot.",
    "You will perhaps tell\nyour friend.",
    "M. Kettering was arrested tonight for the murder of\nhis wife.",
    "You want me to tell Katherine that asked Lenox.",
    "She breathed\nrather hard as though she had been running her face Poirot\nthought looked white and strained  rather noticeably so.",
    "If you please Mademoiselle.",
    "Why said Lenox.",
    "Do you think Katherine will be upset Do you\nthink she cares\n\n\fI dont know Mademoiselle said Poirot.",
    "See I admit it frankly.",
    "As a rule I know everything but in this case I  well I do not.",
    "You\nperhaps know better than I do.",
    "Yes said Lenox I know  but I am not going to tell you all the\nsame.",
    "She paused for a minute or two her dark brows drawn together in\na frown.",
    "You believe he did it she said abruptly.",
    "Poirot shrugged his\nshoulders.",
    "The police say so.",
    "Ah said Lenox hedging are you So there is something to\nhedge about.",
    "Again she was silent frowning.",
    "Poirot said gently\n\nYou have known Derek Kettering a long time have you not\n\nOff and on ever since I was a kid said Lenox gruffly.",
    "Poirot nodded his head several times without speaking.",
    "With one of her brusque movements Lenox drew forward a chair\nand sat down on it her elbows on the table and her face\nsupported by her hands.",
    "Sitting thus she looked directly across\nthe table at Poirot.",
    "What have they got to go on she demanded.",
    "Motive I suppose.",
    "Probably came into money at her death.",
    "He came into two million.",
    "And if she had not died he would have been ruined\n\nYes.",
    "But there must have been more than that persisted Lenox.",
    "He\ntravelled by the same train I know but  that would not be enough\nto go on by itself.",
    "A cigarette case with the letter K on it which did not belong to\nMrs Kettering was found in her carriage and he was seen by two\npeople entering and leaving the compartment just before the train\ngot into Lyons.",
    "What two people\n\nYour friend Miss Grey was one of them.",
    "The other was\nMademoiselle Mirelle the dancer.",
    "And he Derek what has he got to say about it demanded\nLenox sharply.",
    "He denies having entered his wifes compartment at all said\nPoirot.",
    "Fool said Lenox crisply frowning.",
    "Just before Lyons you say\nDoes nobody know when  when she died\n\nThe doctors evidence necessarily cannot be very definite said\nPoirot they are inclined to think that death was unlikely to have\noccurred after leaving Lyons.",
    "And we know this much that a few\nmoments after leaving Lyons Mrs Kettering was dead.",
    "How do you know that\n\nPoirot was smiling rather oddly to himself.",
    "Someone else went into her compartment and found her dead.",
    "And they did not rouse the train\n\nNo.",
    "Why was that\n\nDoubtless they had their reasons.",
    "Lenox looked at him sharply.",
    "Do you know the reason\n\nI think so  yes.",
    "Lenox sat still turning things over in her mind.",
    "Poirot watched her\nin silence.",
    "At last he looked up.",
    "A soft colour had come into her\ncheeks and her eyes were shining.",
    "You think someone on the train must have killed her but that\nneed not be so at all.",
    "What is to stop anyone swinging themselves\non to the train when it stopped at Lyons They could go straight to\nher compartment strangle her and take the rubies and drop off\nthe train again without anyone being the wiser.",
    "She may have\nbeen actually killed while the train was in Lyons station.",
    "Then she\nwould have been alive when Derek went in and dead when the\nother person found her.",
    "Poirot leant back in his chair.",
    "He drew a deep breath.",
    "He looked\nacross at the girl and nodded his head three times then he\nheaved a sigh.",
    "Mademoiselle he said what you have said there is very just very true.",
    "I was struggling in darkness and you have shown me a\nlight.",
    "There was a point that puzzled me and you have made it\nplain.",
    "He got up.",
    "And Derek said Lenox.",
    "Who knows said Poirot with a shrug of his shoulders.",
    "But I will\ntell you this Mademoiselle.",
    "I am not satisfied no I Hercule Poirot\nam not yet satisfied.",
    "It may be that this very night I shall learn\nsomething more.",
    "At least I go to try.",
    "You are meeting someone\n\nYes.",
    "Someone who knows something\n\nSomeone who might know something.",
    "In these matters one must\nleave no stone unturned.",
    "Au revoir Mademoiselle.",
    "Lenox accompanied him to the door.",
    "Have I  helped she asked.",
    "Poirots face softened as he looked up at her standing on the\ndoorstep above him.",
    "Yes Mademoiselle you have helped.",
    "If things are very dark\nalways remember that.",
    "When the car had driven off he relapsed into a frowning\nabsorption but in his eyes was that faint green light which was\nalways the precursor of the triumph to be.",
    "He was a few minutes\nlate at the rendezvous and found that M. Papopolous and his\ndaughter had arrived before him.",
    "His apologies were abject and\nhe outdid himself in politeness and small attentions.",
    "The Greek\nwas looking particularly benign and noble this evening a\nsorrowful patriarch of blameless life Zia was looking handsome\nand goodhumoured.",
    "The dinner was a pleasant one.",
    "Poirot was\nhis best and most sparkling self.",
    "He told anecdotes he made\n\n\fjokes he paid graceful compliments to Zia Papopolous and he\ntold many interesting incidents of his career.",
    "The menu was a\ncarefully selected one and the wine was excellent.",
    "At the close of dinner M. Papopolous inquired politely And the tip\nI gave you You have had your little flutter on the horse\n\nI am in communication with  er  my bookmaker replied Poirot.",
    "The eyes of the two men met.",
    "A wellknown horse eh\n\nNo said Poirot it is what our friends the English call a dark\nhorse.",
    "Ah said M. Papopolous thoughtfully.",
    "Now we must step across to the Casino and have our little flutter\nat the roulette table cried Poirot gaily.",
    "At the Casino the party separated Poirot devoting himself solely\nto Zia whilst Papopolous himself drifted away.",
    "Poirot was not fortunate but Zia had a run of good luck and had\nsoon won a few thousand francs.",
    "It would be as well she observed drily to Poirot if I stopped\nnow.",
    "Poirots eyes twinkled.",
    "Superb he exclaimed.",
    "You are the daughter of your father\nMademoiselle Zia.",
    "To know when to stop.",
    "Ah that is the art.",
    "He looked round the rooms.",
    "I cannot see your father anywhere about he remarked\ncarelessly.",
    "I will fetch your cloak for you Mademoiselle and we\nwill go out in the gardens.",
    "He did not however go straight to the cloakroom.",
    "His sharp eyes\nhad seen but a little while before the departure of M. Papopolous.",
    "He was anxious to know what had become of the wily Greek.",
    "He\nran him to earth unexpectedly in the big entrance hall.",
    "He was standing by one of the pillars talking to a lady who had\njust arrived.",
    "The lady was Mirelle.",
    "Poirot sidled unostentatiously round the room.",
    "He arrived at the\nother side of the pillar and unnoticed by the two who were talking\ntogether in an animated fashion  or rather that is to say the\ndancer was talking Papopolous contributing an occasional\nmonosyllable and a good many expressive gestures.",
    "I tell you I must have time the dancer was saying If you give\nme time I will get the money.",
    "To wait  the Greek shrugged his shoulders  it is awkward.",
    "Only a very little while pleaded the other.",
    "Ah but you must A\nweek  ten days  that is all I ask.",
    "You can be sure of your affair.",
    "The money will be forthcoming.",
    "Papopolous shifted a little and looked round him uneasily  to find\nPoirot almost at his elbow with a beaming innocent face.",
    "Ah vous voil\u00e0 M. Papopolous.",
    "I have been looking for you.",
    "It is\npermitted that I take Mademoiselle Zia for a little turn in the\ngardens Good evening Mademoiselle.",
    "He bowed very low to\nMirelle.",
    "A thousand pardons that I did not see you immediately.",
    "The dancer accepted his greetings rather impatiently.",
    "She was\nclearly annoyed at the interruption of her t\u00eate\u0430t\u00eate.",
    "Poirot was\nquick to take the hint.",
    "Papopolous had already murmured\nCertainly  but certainly and Poirot withdrew forthwith.",
    "He\nfetched Zias cloak and together they strolled out into the\ngardens.",
    "This is where the suicides take place said Zia.",
    "Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "So it is said.",
    "Men are foolish are\nthey not Mademoiselle To eat to drink to breathe the good air it\nis a very pleasant thing Mademoiselle.",
    "One is foolish to leave all\nthat simply because one has no money  or because the heart\naches.",
    "Lamour it causes many fatalities does it not\n\nZia laughed.",
    "You should not laugh at love Mademoiselle said Poirot shaking\nan energetic forefinger at her.",
    "You who are young and beautiful.",
    "Hardly that said Zia you forget that I am thirtythree M. Poirot.",
    "I am frank with you because it is no good being otherwise.",
    "As you\ntold my father it is exactly seventeen years since you aided us in\nParis that time.",
    "When I look at you it seems much less said Poirot gallantly.",
    "You were then very much as you are now Mademoiselle a little\nthinner a little paler a little more serious.",
    "Sixteen years old and\nfresh from your pension.",
    "Not quite the petite pensionnaire not\nquite a woman.",
    "You were very delicious very charming\nMademoiselle Zia others thought so too without doubt.",
    "At sixteen said Zia one is simple and a little fool.",
    "That may be said Poirot yes that well may be.",
    "At sixteen one\nis credulous is one not One believes what one is told.",
    "If he saw the quick sideways glance that the girl shot at him he\npretended not to have done so.",
    "He continued dreamily It was a\ncurious affair that altogether.",
    "Your father Mademoiselle has\nnever understood the true inwardness of it.",
    "No\n\nWhen he asked me for details for explanations I said to him thus\nWithout scandal I have got back for you that which was lost.",
    "You\n\n\fmust ask no questions.",
    "Do you know Mademoiselle why I said\nthese things\n\nI have no idea said the girl coldly.",
    "It was because I had a soft spot in my heart for a little\npensionnaire so pale so thin so serious.",
    "I dont understand what you are talking about cried Zia angrily.",
    "Do you\n\nnot\n\nMademoiselle\n\nHave\n\nyou forgotten\n\nAntonio\n\nPirezzio\n\nHe heard the quick intake of her breath  almost a gasp.",
    "He came to work as an assistant in the shop but not thus could\nhe have got hold of what he wanted.",
    "An assistant can lift his eyes\nto his masters daughter can he not If he is young and handsome\nwith a glib tongue.",
    "And since they cannot make love all the time\nthey must occasionally talk of things that interest them both  such\nas that very interesting thing which was temporarily in M.\nPapopolous possession.",
    "And since as you say Mademoiselle the\nyoung are foolish and credulous it was easy to believe him and to\ngive him a sight of that particular thing to show him where it was\nkept.",
    "And afterwards when it is gone  when the unbelievable\ncatastrophe has happened.",
    "Alas the poor little pensionnaire.",
    "What a terrible position she is in.",
    "She is frightened the poor little\none.",
    "To speak or not to speak And then there comes along that\nexcellent fellow Hercule Poirot.",
    "Almost a miracle it must have\n\n\fbeen the way things arranged themselves.",
    "The priceless\nheirlooms are restored and there are no awkward questions.",
    "Zia turned on him fiercely.",
    "You have known all the time Who told you Was it  was it\nAntonio\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "No one told me he said quietly.",
    "I guessed.",
    "It was a good guess\nwas it not Mademoiselle You see unless you are good at\nguessing it is not much use being a detective.",
    "The girl walked along beside him for some minutes in silence.",
    "Then she said in a hard voice\n\nWell what are you going to do about it are you going to tell my\nfather\n\nNo said Poirot sharply.",
    "Certainly not.",
    "She looked at him curiously.",
    "You want something from me\n\nI want your help Mademoiselle.",
    "What makes you think that I can help you\n\n\fI do not think so.",
    "I only hope so.",
    "And if I do not help you then  you will tell my father\n\nBut no but no Disembarrass yourself of that idea Mademoiselle.",
    "I am not a blackmailer.",
    "I do not hold your secret over your head\nand threaten you with it.",
    "If I refuse to help you  began the girl slowly.",
    "Then you refuse and that is that.",
    "Then why  she stopped.",
    "Listen and I will tell you why.",
    "Women Mademoiselle are\ngenerous.",
    "If they can render a service to one who has rendered a\nservice to them they will do it.",
    "I was generous once to you\nMademoiselle.",
    "When I might have spoken I held my tongue.",
    "There was another silence then the girl said My father gave you\na hint the other day.",
    "It was very kind of him.",
    "I do not think said Zia slowly that there is anything that I can\nadd to that.",
    "If Poirot was disappointed he did not show it.",
    "Not a muscle of his\nface changed.",
    "Eh bien he said cheerfully then we must talk of other things.",
    "And he proceeded to chat gaily.",
    "The girl was distrait however\nand her answers were mechanical and not always to the point.",
    "It\nwas when they were approaching the Casino once more that she\nseemed to come to a decision.",
    "M. Poirot\n\nYes Mademoiselle\n\nI  I should like to help you if I could.",
    "You are very amiable Mademoiselle  very amiable.",
    "Again there was a pause.",
    "Poirot did not press her.",
    "He was quite\ncontent to wait and let her take her own time.",
    "Ah bah said Zia after all why should I not tell you My father is\ncautious  very cautious in everything he says.",
    "But I know that with\nyou it is not necessary.",
    "You have told us it is only the murderer\nyou seek and that you are not concerned over the jewels.",
    "I\nbelieve you.",
    "You were quite right when you guessed that we were\nin Nice because of the rubies.",
    "They have been handed over here\naccording to plan.",
    "My father has them now.",
    "He gave you a hint the\nother day as to who our mysterious client was.",
    "The Marquis murmured Poirot softly.",
    "Yes the Marquis.",
    "Have you ever seen the Marquis Mademoiselle Zia\n\nOnce said the girl.",
    "But not very well she added.",
    "It was\nthrough a keyhole.",
    "That always presents difficulties said Poirot sympathetically\nbut all the same you saw him.",
    "You would know him again\n\nZia shook her head.",
    "He wore a mask she explained.",
    "Young or old\n\nHe had white hair.",
    "It may have been a wig it may not.",
    "It fitted\nvery well.",
    "But I do not think he was old.",
    "His walk was young and\nso was his voice.",
    "His voice said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Ah his voice Would you\nknow it again Mademoiselle Zia\n\nI might said the girl.",
    "You were interested in him eh It was that that took you to the\nkeyhole.",
    "Zia nodded.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "I was curious.",
    "One had heard so much  he is not the\nordinary thief  he is more like a figure of history or romance.",
    "Yes said Poirot thoughtfully yes perhaps so.",
    "But it is not this that I meant to tell you said Zia.",
    "It was just one\nother little fact that I thought might be  well  useful to you.",
    "Yes said Poirot encouragingly.",
    "The rubies as I say were handed over to my father here at Nice.",
    "I did not see the person who handed them over but \n\nYes\n\nI know one thing.",
    "It was a woman.",
    "Chapter 29\n\nA LETTER FROM HOME\n\nDear Katherine\nLiving among grand friends as you are doing now I dont\nsuppose you will care to hear any of our news but as I always\nthought you were a sensible girl perhaps you are a trifle less\nswollenheaded than I suppose.",
    "Everything goes on much the\nsame here.",
    "There was great trouble about the new curate who is\n\n\fscandalously high.",
    "In my view he is neither more nor less than a\nRoman.",
    "Everybody has spoken to the Vicar about it but you know\nwhat the Vicar is  all Christian charity and no proper spirit.",
    "I have\nhad a lot of trouble with maids lately.",
    "That girl Annie was no good skirts up to her knees and wouldnt wear sensible woollen\nstockings.",
    "Not one of them can bear being spoken to.",
    "I have had a\nlot of pain with my rheumatism one way and another and Dr\nHarris persuaded me to go and see a London specialist  a waste\nof three guineas and a railway fare as I told him but by waiting\nuntil Wednesday I managed to get a cheap return.",
    "The London\ndoctor pulled a long face and talked all round about and never\nstraight out until I said to him Im a plain woman Doctor and I\nlike things to be plainly stated.",
    "Is it cancer or is it not And then\nof course he had to say it was.",
    "They say a year with care and not\ntoo much pain though I am sure I can bear pain as well as any\nother Christian woman.",
    "Life seems rather lonely at times with\nmost of my friends dead or gone before.",
    "I wish you were in St Mary\nMead my dear and that is a fact.",
    "If you hadnt come into this\nmoney and gone off into grand society I would have offered you\ndouble the salary poor Jane gave you to come and look after me\nbut there  theres no good wanting what we cant get.",
    "However if\nthings should go ill with you  and that is always possible.",
    "I have\nheard no end of tales of bogus noblemen marrying girls and\ngetting hold of their money and then leaving them at the church\ndoor.",
    "I dare say you are too sensible for anything of the kind to\nhappen to you but one never knows and never having had much\nattention of any kind it might easily go to your head now.",
    "So just in\ncase my dear remember there is always a home for you here\nand though a plainspoken woman I am a warmhearted one too.",
    "Your affectionate old friend\nAmelia Viner.",
    "P.S.",
    "I saw a mention of you in the paper with your cousin\nViscountess Tamplin and I cut it out and put it with my cuttings.",
    "I\nprayed for you on Sunday that you might be kept from pride and\nvain glory.",
    "Katherine read this characteristic epistle through twice then she\nlaid it down and stared out of her bedroom window across the\nblue waters of the Mediterranean.",
    "She felt a curious lump in her\nthroat.",
    "A sudden wave of longing for St Mary Mead swept over\nher.",
    "So full of familiar everyday stupid little things  and yet home.",
    "She felt very inclined to lay her head down on her arms and\nindulge in a real good cry.",
    "Lenox coming in at the moment saved her.",
    "Hello Katherine said Lenox.",
    "I say  what is the matter\n\nNothing said Katherine grabbing up Miss Viners letter and\nthrusting it into her handbag.",
    "You looked rather queer said Lenox.",
    "I say  I hope you dont\nmind  I rang up your detective friend M. Poirot and asked him to\nlunch with us in Nice.",
    "I said you wanted to see him as I thought he\nmight not come for me.",
    "Did you want to see him then asked Katherine.",
    "Yes said Lenox.",
    "I have rather lost my heart to him.",
    "I never met\na man before whose eyes were really green like a cats.",
    "All right said Katherine.",
    "She spoke listlessly.",
    "The last few days\nhad been trying.",
    "Derek Ketterings arrest had been the topic of the\nhour and the Blue Train Mystery had been thrashed out from\nevery conceivable standpoint.",
    "I have ordered the car said Lenox and I have told Mother\nsome lie or other  unfortunately I cant remember exactly what\nbut it wont matter as she never remembers.",
    "If she knew where\nwe were going she would want to come too to pump M. Poirot.",
    "The two girls arrived at the Negresco to find Poirot waiting.",
    "He was full of Gallic politeness and showered so many\ncompliments upon the two girls that they were soon helpless with\nlaughter yet for all that the meal was not a gay one.",
    "Katherine\nwas\n\ndreamy\n\nand\n\ndistracted\n\nand\n\nLenox\n\nmade bursts\n\nof\n\nconversation interspersed by silences.",
    "As they were sitting on\nthe terrace sipping their coffee she suddenly attacked Poirot\nbluntly.",
    "How are things going You know what I mean\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "They take their course he said.",
    "And you are just letting them take their course\n\n\fHe looked at Lenox a little sadly.",
    "You are young Mademoiselle but there are three things that\ncannot be hurried  le bon Dieu Nature and old people.",
    "Nonsense said Lenox.",
    "You are not old.",
    "Ah it is pretty what you say there.",
    "Here is Major Knighton said Lenox.",
    "Katherine looked round\nquickly and then turned back again.",
    "He is with Mr Van Aldin continued Lenox.",
    "There is something I\nwant to ask Major Knighton about.",
    "I wont be a minute.",
    "Left alone together Poirot bent forward and murmured to\nKatherine\n\nYou are distraite Mademoiselle your thoughts they are far\naway are they not\n\nJust as far as England no farther.",
    "Guided by a sudden impulse she took the letter she had received\nthat morning and handed it across to him to read.",
    "That is the first word that has come to me from my old life\nsomehow or other  it hurts.",
    "He read it through and then handed it back to her.",
    "So you are\ngoing back to St Mary Mead he said slowly.",
    "No I am not said Katherine why should I\n\nAh said Poirot it is my mistake.",
    "You will excuse me one little\nminute.",
    "He strolled across to where Lenox Tamplin was talking to Van\nAldin and Knighton.",
    "The American looked old and haggard.",
    "He greeted Poirot with a\ncurt nod but without any other sign of animation.",
    "As he turned to reply to some observation made by Lenox Poirot\ndrew Knighton aside.",
    "M. Van Aldin looks ill he said.",
    "Do you wonder asked Knighton.",
    "The scandal of Derek\nKetterings arrest has about put the lid on things as far as he is\nconcerned.",
    "He is even regretting that he asked you to find out the\ntruth.",
    "He should go back to England said Poirot.",
    "We are going the day after tomorrow.",
    "That is good news said Poirot.",
    "He hesitated and looked across the terrace to where Katherine\nwas sitting.",
    "I wish he murmured that you could tell Miss Grey that.",
    "Tell her what\n\nThat you  I mean that M. Van Aldin is I returning to England.",
    "Knighton looked a little puzzled but he readily crossed the\nterrace and joined Katherine.",
    "Poirot saw him go with a satisfied nod of the head and then joined\nLenox and the American.",
    "After a minute or two they joined the\nothers.",
    "Conversation was general for a few minutes then the\nmillionaire and his secretary departed.",
    "Poirot also prepared to\ntake his departure.",
    "A thousand thanks for your hospitality Mesdemoiselles he\ncried it has been a most charming luncheon.",
    "Ma foi I needed it\nHe swelled out his chest and thumped it.",
    "I am now a lion  a giant.",
    "Ah Mademoiselle Katherine you have not seen me as I can be.",
    "You have seen the gentle the calm Hercule Poirot but there is\nanother Hercule Poirot.",
    "I go now to bully to threaten to strike\nterror into the hearts of those who listen to me.",
    "He looked at them in a selfsatisfied way and they both appeared\nto be duly impressed though Lenox was biting her under lip and\nthe corners of Katherines mouth had a suspicious twitch.",
    "And I shall do it he said gravely.",
    "Oh yes I shall succeed.",
    "He had gone but a few steps when Katherines voice made him\nturn.",
    "M. Poirot I  I want to tell you.",
    "I think you were right in what you\nsaid.",
    "I am going back to England almost immediately.",
    "Poirot stared at her very hard and under the directness of his\nscrutiny she blushed.",
    "I see he said gravely.",
    "I dont believe you do said Katherine.",
    "I know more than you think Mademoiselle he said quietly.",
    "He left her with an odd little smile upon his lips.",
    "Entering a waiting\ncar he drove to Antibes.",
    "Hippolyte the Comte de la Roches woodenfaced manservant\nwas busy at the Villa Marina polishing his masters beautiful cutglass table.",
    "The Comte de la Roche himself had gone to Monte\nCarlo for the day.",
    "Chancing to look out of the window Hippolyte espied a visitor\nwalking briskly up to the hall door a visitor of so uncommon a type\nthat Hippolyte experienced as he was had some difficulty in\nplacing him.",
    "Calling to his wife Marie who was busy in the\nkitchen he drew her attention to what he called ce type l\u00e0.",
    "It is not the police again said Marie anxiously.",
    "Look for yourself said Hippolyte.",
    "Marie looked.",
    "Certainly not the police she declared.",
    "I am glad.",
    "They have not really worried us much said Hippolyte.",
    "In fact\nbut for Monsieur le Comtes warning I should never have guessed\nthat stranger at the wineshop to be what he was.",
    "The hall bell pealed and Hippolyte in a grave and decorous\nmanner went to open the door.",
    "M. le Comte I regret to say is not at home.",
    "The little man with the large moustaches beamed placidly.",
    "I know that he replied.",
    "You are Hippolyte Flavelle are you\nnot\n\nYes Monsieur that is my name.",
    "And you have a wife Marie Flavelle\n\nYes Monsieur but \n\n\fI desire to see you both said the stranger and he stepped\nnimbly past Hippolyte into the hall.",
    "Your wife is doubtless in the kitchen he said.",
    "I will go there.",
    "Before Hippolyte could recover his breath the other had selected\nthe right door at the back of the hall and passed along the\npassage and into the kitchen where Marie paused openmouthed\nto stare at him.",
    "Voil\u00e0 said the stranger and sank into a wooden armchair I am\nHercule Poirot.",
    "Yes Monsieur\n\nYou do not know the name\n\nI have never heard it said Hippolyte.",
    "Permit me to say that you have been badly educated.",
    "It is the\nname of one of the great ones of this world.",
    "He sighed and folded his hands across his chest.",
    "Hippolyte and Marie were staring at him uneasily.",
    "They were at a\nloss what to make of this unexpected and extremely strange\nvisitor.",
    "Monsieur desires  murmured Hippolyte mechanically.",
    "I desire to know why you have lied to the police.",
    "Monsieur cried Hippolyte I  lied to the police Never have I\ndone such a thing.",
    "M. Poirot shook his head.",
    "You are wrong he said you have done on several occasions.",
    "Let me see.",
    "He took small notebook from his pocket and\nconsulted it.",
    "Ah yes on seven occasions at least.",
    "I will recite\nthem to you.",
    "In a gentle unemotional voice he proceeded to outline the seven\noccasions.",
    "Hippolyte was taken aback.",
    "But it is not of these past lapses that I wish to speak continued\nPoirot only my dear friend do not get into the habit of thinking\nyourself too clever.",
    "I come now to the particular lie in which I am\nconcerned  your statement that the Comte de la Roche arrived at\nthis villa on the morning of 14th January.",
    "But that was no lie Monsieur that was the truth.",
    "Monsieur le\nComte arrived here on the morning of Tuesday the 14th.",
    "That is\nso Marie is it not\n\nMarie assented eagerly.",
    "Ah yes that is quite right.",
    "I remember it perfectly.",
    "Ah said Poirot and what did you give your good master for\nd\u00e9jeuner that day\n\nI  Marie paused trying to collect herself.",
    "Odd said Poirot how one remembers some things  and\nforgets others.",
    "He leant forward and struck the table a blow with his fist his eyes\nflashed with anger.",
    "Yes yes it is as I say.",
    "You tell your lies and you think nobody\nknows.",
    "But there are two people who know.",
    "Yes  two people.",
    "One\nis le bon Dieu \n\nHe raised a hand to heaven and then settling himself back in his\nchair and shutting his eyelids he murmured comfortably\n\nAnd the other is Hercule Poirot.",
    "I assure you Monsieur you are completely mistaken.",
    "Monsieur le\nComte left Paris on Monday night \n\nTrue said Poirot by the Rapide.",
    "I do not know where he broke\nhis journey.",
    "Perhaps you do not know that.",
    "What I do know is that\nhe arrived here on Wednesday morning and not on Tuesday\nmorning.",
    "Monsieur is mistaken said Marie stolidly.",
    "Poirot rose to his feet.",
    "Then the law must take its course he murmured.",
    "A pity.",
    "What do you mean Monsieur asked Marie with a shade of\nuneasiness.",
    "You will be arrested and held as accomplices concerned in the\nmurder of Mrs Kettering the English lady who was killed.",
    "Murder\n\nThe mans face had gone chalk white his knees knocked together.",
    "Marie dropped the rollingpin and began to weep.",
    "But it is impossible  impossible.",
    "I thought \n\nSince you stick to your story there is nothing to be said.",
    "I think\nyou are both foolish.",
    "He was turning towards the door when an agitated voice arrested\nhim.",
    "Monsieur Monsieur just a little moment.",
    "I  I had no idea that it\nwas anything of this kind.",
    "I  I thought it was just a matter\nconcerning a lady.",
    "There have been little awkwardnesses with the\npolice over ladies before.",
    "But murder  that is very different.",
    "I have no patience with you cried Poirot.",
    "He turned round on\nthem and angrily shook his fist in Hippolytes face.",
    "Am I to stop\nhere all day arguing with a couple of imbeciles thus It is the truth\nI want.",
    "If you will not give it to me that is your look out.",
    "For the last\ntime when did Monsieur le Comte arrive at the Villa Marina Tuesday morning or Wednesday morning\n\nWednesday gasped the man and behind him Marie nodded\nconfirmation.",
    "Poirot regarded them for a minute or two then inclined his head\ngravely.",
    "You are wise my children he said quietly.",
    "Very nearly you\nwere in serious trouble.",
    "He left the Villa Marina smiling to himself.",
    "One guess confirmed he murmured to himself.",
    "Shall I take a\nchance on the other\n\nIt was six oclock when the card of Monsieur Hercule Poirot was\nbrought up to Mirelle.",
    "She stared at it for a moment or two and then nodded.",
    "When\nPoirot entered he found her walking up and down the room\nfeverishly.",
    "She turned on him furiously.",
    "Well she cried.",
    "Well What is it now Have you not tortured me\nenough all of you Have you not made me betray my poor\nDereek What more do you want\n\nJust one little question Mademoiselle.",
    "After the train left Lyons\nwhen you entered Mrs Ketterings compartment \n\nWhat is that\n\nPoirot looked at her with an air of mild reproach and began again.",
    "I say when you entered Mrs Ketterings compartment \n\nI never did.",
    "And found her \n\nI never did.",
    "Ah sacr\u00e9\n\nHe turned on her in a rage and shouted at her so that she\ncowered back before him.",
    "Will you lie to me I tell you I know what happened as well as\nthough I had been there.",
    "You went into her compartment and you\nfound her dead.",
    "I tell you I know it.",
    "To lie to me is dangerous.",
    "Be\ncareful Mademoiselle Mirelle.",
    "Her eyes wavered beneath his gaze and fell.",
    "I  I didnt  she began uncertainly and stopped.",
    "There is only one thing about which I wonder said Poirot.",
    "I\nwonder Mademoiselle if you found what you were looking for or\nwhether \n\nWhether what\n\nOr whether someone else had been before you.",
    "I will answer no more questions screamed the dancer.",
    "She tore\nherself away from Poirots restraining hand and flinging herself\ndown on the floor in a frenzy she screamed and sobbed.",
    "A\nfrightened maid came rushing in.",
    "Hercule Poirot shrugged his shoulders raised his eyebrows and\nquietly left the room.",
    "But he seemed satisfied.",
    "Chapter 30\n\nMISS VINER GIVES JUDGMENT\n\nKatherine looked out of Miss Viners bedroom window.",
    "It was\nraining not violently but with a quiet wellbred persistence.",
    "The\nwindow looked out on a strip of front garden with a path down to\n\n\fthe gate and neat little flowerbeds on either side where later\nroses and pinks and blue hyacinths would bloom.",
    "Miss Viner was\nlying in a large Victorian bedstead.",
    "A tray with the remains of\nbreakfast had been pushed to one side and she was busy opening\nher correspondence and making various caustic comments upon\nit.",
    "Katherine had an open letter in her hand and was reading it\nthrough for the second time.",
    "It was dated from the Ritz Hotel\nParis.",
    "Ch\u00e8re Mademoiselle Katherine it began\nI trust that you are in good health and that the return to the\nEnglish winter has not proved too depressing.",
    "Me I prosecute my\ninquiries with the utmost diligence.",
    "Do not think that it is the\nholiday that I take here.",
    "Very shortly I shall be in England and I\nhope then to have the pleasure of meeting you once more.",
    "It shall\nbe so shall it not On arrival in London I shall write to you.",
    "You\nremember that we are the colleagues in this affair But indeed I\nthink you know that very well.",
    "Be assured Mademoiselle of my most respectful and devoted\nsentiments.",
    "Hercule Poirot.",
    "Katherine frowned slightly.",
    "It was as though something in the\nletter puzzled and intrigued her.",
    "A choir boys picnic indeed came from Miss Viner.",
    "Tommy\nSaunders and Albert Dykes ought to be left behind and I shant\n\n\fsubscribe to it unless they are.",
    "What those two boys think they are\ndoing in church on Sundays I dont know.",
    "Tommy sang O God\nmake speed to save us and never opened his lips again and if\nAlbert Dykes wasnt sucking a mint humbug my nose is not what it\nis and always has been.",
    "I know they are awful agreed Katherine.",
    "She opened her second letter and a sudden flush came to her\ncheeks.",
    "Miss Viners voice in the room seemed to recede into the\nfar distance.",
    "When she came back to a sense of her surroundings Miss Viner\nwas bringing a long speech to a triumphant termination.",
    "And I said to her Not at all.",
    "As it happens Miss Grey is Lady\nTamplins own cousin.",
    "What do you think of that\n\nWere you fighting my battles for me That was very sweet of\nyou.",
    "You can put it that way if you like.",
    "There is nothing to me in a title.",
    "Vicars wife or no vicars wife that woman is a cat.",
    "Hinting you\nhad bought your way into Society.",
    "Perhaps she was not so very far wrong.",
    "And look at you continued Miss Viner.",
    "Have you come back a\nstuckup fine lady as well you might have done No there you\nare as sensible as ever you were with a pair of good Balbriggan\n\n\fstockings on and sensible shoes.",
    "I spoke to Ellen about it only\nyesterday.",
    "Ellen I said you look at Miss Grey.",
    "She has been\nhobnobbing with some of the greatest in the land and does she go\nabout as you do with skirts up to her knees and silk stockings that\nladder when you look at them and the most ridiculous shoes that\never I set eyes on.",
    "Katherine smiled a little to herself it had apparently been worth\nwhile to conform to Miss Viners prejudices.",
    "The old lady went on\nwith increasing gusto.",
    "It has been a great relief to me that you have not had your head\nturned.",
    "Only the other day I was looking for my cuttings.",
    "I have\nseveral about Lady Tamplin and her War Hospital and what not\nbut I cannot lay my hand upon them.",
    "I wish you would look my\ndear your eyesight is better than mine.",
    "They are all in a box in the\nbureau drawer.",
    "Katherine glanced down at the letter in her hand and was about to\nspeak but checked herself and going over to the bureau found\nthe box of cuttings and began to look over them.",
    "Since her return\nto St Mary Mead her heart had gone out to Miss Viner in\nadmiration of the old womans stoicism and pluck.",
    "She felt that\nthere was little she could do for her old friend but she knew from\nexperience how much those seemingly small trifles meant to old\npeople.",
    "Here is one she said presently.",
    "Viscountess Tamplin who is\nrunning her villa at Nice as an Officers Hospital has just been the\nvictim of a sensational robbery her jewels having been stolen.",
    "Amongst them were some very famous emeralds heirlooms of the\nTamplin family.",
    "Probably paste said Miss Viner a lot of these Society womens\njewels are.",
    "Here is another said Katherine.",
    "A picture of her A charming\ncamera study of Viscountess Tamplin with her little daughter\nLenox.",
    "Let me look said Miss Viner.",
    "You cant see much of the childs\nface can you But I dare say that is just as well.",
    "Things go by\ncontraries in this world and beautiful mothers have hideous\nchildren.",
    "I dare say the photographer realized that to take the\nback of the childs head was the best thing he could do for her.",
    "Katherine laughed.",
    "One of the smartest hostesses on the Riviera this season is\nViscountess Tamplin who has a villa at Cap Martin.",
    "Her cousin\nMiss Grey who recently inherited a vast fortune in a most\nromantic manner is staying with her there.",
    "That is the one I wanted said Miss Viner.",
    "I expect there has\nbeen a picture of you in one of the papers that I have missed you\nknow the kind of thing.",
    "Mrs Somebody or other JonesWilliams at\nthe something or other pointtopoint usually carrying a shootingstick and having one foot lifted up in the air.",
    "It must be a trial to\nsome of them to see what they look like.",
    "Katherine did not answer.",
    "She was smoothing out the cutting with\nher finger and her face had a puzzled worried look.",
    "Then she\ndrew the second letter out of its envelope and mastered its\ncontents once more.",
    "She turned to her friend.",
    "Miss Viner I wonder  there is a friend of mine someone I met on\nthe Riviera who wants very much to come down and see me\nhere\n\nA man said Miss Viner.",
    "Yes.",
    "Who is he\n\nHe is secretary to Mr Van Aldin the American millionaire.",
    "What is his name\n\nKnighton Major Knighton.",
    "Hm  secretary to a millionaire.",
    "And wants to come down here.",
    "Now Katherine I am going to say something to you for your own\ngood.",
    "You are a nice girl and a sensible girl and though you have\nyour head screwed on the right way about most things every\nwoman makes a fool of herself once in her life.",
    "Ten to one what\nthis man is after is your money.",
    "With a gesture she arrested Katherines reply.",
    "I have been\nwaiting for something of this kind.",
    "What is a secretary to a\n\n\fmillionaire Nine times out of ten it is a young man who likes living\nsoft.",
    "A young man with nice manners and a taste for luxury and no\nbrains and no enterprise and if there is anything that is a softer\njob than being a secretary to a millionaire it is marrying a rich\nwoman for her money.",
    "I am not saying that you might not be some\nmans fancy.",
    "But you are not young and though you have a very\ngood complexion you are not a beauty and what I say to you is\ndont make a fool of yourself but if you are determined to do so\ndo see that your money is properly tied up on yourself.",
    "There now\nI have finished.",
    "What have you got to say\n\nNothing said Katherine but would you mind if he did come\ndown to see me\n\nI wash my hands of it said Miss Viner.",
    "I have done my duty and\nwhatever happens now is on your own head.",
    "Would you like him to\nlunch or to dinner I dare say Ellen could manage dinner  that is\nif she didnt lose her head.",
    "Lunch would be very nice said Katherine.",
    "It is awfully kind of\nyou Miss Viner.",
    "He asked me to ring him up so I will do so and say\nthat we shall be pleased if he will lunch with us.",
    "He will motor\ndown from town.",
    "Ellen does a steak with grilled tomatoes pretty fairly said Miss\nViner.",
    "She doesnt do it well but she does it better than anything\nelse.",
    "It is no good having a tart because she is heavy handed with\npastry but her little castle puddings are not bad and I dare say\nyou could find a nice piece of Stilton at Abbots.",
    "I have always\nheard that gentlemen like a nice piece of Stilton and there is a\n\n\fgood deal of fathers wine left a bottle of sparkling Moselle\nperhaps.",
    "Oh no Miss Viner that is really not necessary.",
    "Nonsense my child.",
    "No gentleman is happy unless he drinks\nsomething with his meal.",
    "There is some good prewar whisky if\nyou think he would prefer that.",
    "Now do as I say and dont argue.",
    "The key of the winecellar is in the third drawer down in the\ndressingtable in the second pair of stockings on the lefthand\nside.",
    "Katherine went obediently to the spot indicated.",
    "The second pair now mind said Miss Viner.",
    "The first pair has\nmy diamond earrings and my filigree brooch in it.",
    "Oh said Katherine rather taken aback wouldnt you like them\nput in your jewelcase\n\nMiss Viner gave vent to a terrific and prolonged snort.",
    "No indeed I have much too much sense for that sort of thing\nthank you.",
    "Dear dear I well remember how my poor father had a\nsafe built in downstairs.",
    "Pleased as Punch he was with it and he\nsaid to my mother Now Mary you bring me your jewels in their\ncase every night and I will lock them away for you.",
    "My mother was\na very tactful woman and she knew that gentlemen like having\ntheir own way and she brought him the jewelcase locked up just\nas he said.",
    "And one night burglars broke in and of course  naturally  the\nfirst thing they went for was the safe It would be with my father\ntalking up and down the village and bragging about it until you\nmight have thought he kept all King Solomons diamonds there.",
    "They made a clean sweep got the tankards the silver cups and\nthe presentation gold plate that my father had had presented to\nhim and the jewelcase.",
    "She sighed reminiscently.",
    "My father was in a great state over my\nmothers jewels.",
    "There was the Venetian set and some very fine\ncameos and some pale pink corals and two diamond rings with\nquite large stones in them.",
    "And then of course she had to tell him\nthat being a sensible woman she had kept her jewellery rolled up\nin a pair of corsets and there it was still as safe as anything.",
    "And the jewelcase had been quite empty\n\nOh no dear said Miss Viner it would have been too light a\nweight then.",
    "My mother was a very intelligent woman she saw to\nthat.",
    "She kept her buttons in the jewelcase and a very handy\nplace it was.",
    "Boot buttons in the top tray trouser buttons in the\nsecond tray and assorted buttons below.",
    "Curiously enough my\nfather was quite annoyed with her.",
    "He said he didnt like deceit.",
    "But I mustnt go chattering on you want to go and ring up your\nfriend and mind you choose a nice piece of steak and tell Ellen\nshe is not to have holes in her stockings when she waits at lunch.",
    "Is her name Ellen or Helen Miss Viner I thought \n\n\fMiss Viner closed her eyes.",
    "I can sound my hs dear as well as anyone but Helen is not a\nsuitable name for a servant.",
    "I dont know what the mothers in the\nlower classes are coming to nowadays.",
    "The rain had cleared away when Knighton arrived at the cottage.",
    "The pale fitful sunshine shone down on it and burnished\nKatherines head as she stood in the doorway to welcome him.",
    "He\ncame up to her quickly almost boyishly.",
    "I say I hope you dont mind.",
    "I simply had to see you again soon.",
    "I\nhope the friend you are staying with does not mind.",
    "Come in and make friends with her said Katherine.",
    "She can be\nmost alarming but you will soon find that she has the softest heart\nin the world.",
    "Miss Viner was enthroned majestically in the drawingroom\nwearing a complete set of the cameos which had been so\nprovidentially preserved in the family.",
    "She greeted Knighton with\ndignity and an austere politeness which would have damped many\nmen.",
    "Knighton however had a charm of manner which was not\neasily set aside and after about ten minutes Miss Viner thawed\nperceptibly.",
    "Luncheon was a merry meal and Ellen or Helen in a\nnew pair of silk stockings devoid of ladders performed prodigies\nof waiting.",
    "Afterwards Katherine and Knighton went for a walk\nand they came back to have tea t\u00eate\u0430t\u00eate since Miss Viner had\ngone to lie down.",
    "When the car had finally driven off Katherine went slowly upstairs.",
    "A voice called her and she went in to Miss Viners bedroom.",
    "Friend gone\n\nYes.",
    "Thank you so much for letting me ask him down.",
    "No need to thank me.",
    "Do you think I am the sort of old\ncurmudgeon who will never do anything for anybody\n\nI think you are a dear said Katherine affectionately.",
    "Humph said Miss Viner mollified.",
    "As Katherine was leaving the room she called her back.",
    "Katherine\n\nYes.",
    "I was wrong about that young man of yours.",
    "A man when he is\nmaking up to anybody can be cordial and gallant and full of little\nattentions and altogether charming.",
    "But when a man is really in\nlove he cant help looking like a sheep.",
    "Now whenever that young\nman looked at you he looked like a sheep.",
    "I take back all I said this\nmorning.",
    "It is genuine.",
    "Chapter 31\n\nMR AARONS LUNCHES\n\nAh said Mr Joseph Aarons appreciatively.",
    "He took a long draught from his tankard set it down with a sigh\nwiped the froth from his lips and beamed across the table at his\nhost Monsieur Hercule Poirot.",
    "Give me said Mr Aarons a good Porterhouse steak and a\ntankard of something worth drinking and anyone can have your\nFrench fallals and whatnots your ordoovres and your omelettes\nand your little bits of quail.",
    "Give me he reiterated a\nPorterhouse steak.",
    "Poirot who had just\n\ncomplied with this request smiled\n\nsympathetically.",
    "Not that there is much wrong with a steak and kidney pudding\ncontinued Mr Aarons.",
    "Apple tart Yes I will take apple tart thank\nyou Miss and a jug of cream.",
    "The meal proceeded.",
    "Finally with a long sigh Mr Aarons laid\ndown his spoon and fork preparatory to toying with some cheese\nbefore turning his mind to other matters.",
    "There was a little matter of business I think you said Monsieur\nPoirot he remarked.",
    "Anything I can do to help you I am sure I\nshall be most happy.",
    "That is very kind of you said Poirot.",
    "I said to myself If you\nwant to know anything about the dramatic profession there is one\nperson who knows all that is to be known and that is my old friend\nMr Joseph Aarons.",
    "And you dont say far wrong said Mr Aarons complacently\nwhether it is past present or future Joe Aarons is the man to\ncome to.",
    "Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment.",
    "Now I want to ask you Monsieur Aarons what you\nknow about a young woman called Kidd.",
    "Kidd Kitty Kidd\n\nKitty Kidd.",
    "Pretty smart she was.",
    "Male impersonator song and a dance That one\n\nThat is the one.",
    "Very smart she was.",
    "Made a good income.",
    "Never out of an\nengagement.",
    "Male impersonation mostly but as a matter of fact\nyou could not touch her as a character actress.",
    "So I have heard said Poirot but she has not been appearing\nlately has she\n\nNo.",
    "Dropped right out of things.",
    "Went over to France and took up\nwith some swell nobleman there.",
    "She quitted the stage then for\ngood and all I guess.",
    "How long ago was that\n\nLet me see.",
    "Three years ago.",
    "And she has been a loss  let me tell\nyou that.",
    "She was clever\n\nClever as a cartload of monkeys.",
    "You dont know the name of the man she became friends with in\nParis\n\nHe was a swell I know that.",
    "A Count  or was it a Marquis Now I\ncome to think of it I believe it was a Marquis.",
    "And you know nothing about her since\n\nNothing.",
    "Never even run across her accidentally like.",
    "I bet she is\ntooling it round some of these foreign resorts.",
    "Being a Marquise to\nthe life.",
    "You couldnt put one over on Kitty.",
    "She would give as good\nas she got any day.",
    "I see said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "I am sorry I cant tell you more Monsieur Poirot said the other.",
    "I would like to be of use to you if I could.",
    "You did me a good turn\nonce.",
    "Ah but we are quits on that you too did me a good turn.",
    "One good turn deserves another.",
    "Ha ha said Mr Aarons.",
    "Your profession must be a very interesting one said Poirot.",
    "Soso said Mr Aarons noncommittally.",
    "Taking the rough with\nthe smooth it is all right.",
    "I dont do so badly at it all things\nconsidered but you have to keep your eyes skinned.",
    "Never know\nwhat the public will jump for next.",
    "Dancing has come very much to the fore in the last few years\nmurmured Poirot reflectively.",
    "I never saw anything in this Russian ballet but people like it.",
    "Too\nhighbrow for me.",
    "I met one dancer out on the Riviera  Mademoiselle Mirelle.",
    "Mirelle She is hot stuff by all accounts.",
    "There is always money\ngoing to back her  though so far as that goes the girl can dance\nI have seen her and I know what I am talking about.",
    "I never had\nmuch to do with her myself but I hear she is a terror to deal with.",
    "Tempers and tantrums all the time.",
    "Yes said Poirot thoughtfully yes so I should imagine.",
    "Temperament said Mr Aarons temperament That is what they\ncall it themselves.",
    "My missus was a dancer before she married\nme but I am thankful to say she never had any temperament.",
    "You\ndont want temperament in the home Monsieur Poirot.",
    "I agree with you my friend it is out of place there.",
    "A woman should be calm and sympathetic and a good cook\nsaid Mr Aarons.",
    "Mirelle has not been long before the public has she asked\nPoirot.",
    "About two and a half years that is all said Mr Aarons.",
    "Some\nFrench Duke started her.",
    "I hear now that she has taken up with\nthe exPrime Minister of Greece.",
    "These are the chaps who manage\nto put money away quietly.",
    "That is news to me said Poirot.",
    "Oh shes not one to let the grass grow under her feet.",
    "They say\nthat young Kettering murdered his wife on her account.",
    "I dont\nknow I am sure.",
    "Anyway he is in prison and she had to look\nround for herself and pretty smart she has been about it.",
    "They\nsay she is wearing a ruby the size of a pigeons egg  not that I\nhave ever seen a pigeons egg myself but that is what they always\ncall it in works of fiction.",
    "A ruby the size of a pigeons egg said Poirot.",
    "His eyes were\ngreen and catlike.",
    "How interesting\n\nI had it from a friend of mine said Mr Aarons.",
    "But for all I know\nit may be coloured glass.",
    "They are all the same these women they never stop telling tall stories about their jewels.",
    "Mirelle goes\nabout bragging that it has got a curse on it.",
    "Heart of Fire I think\nshe calls it.",
    "But if I remember rightly said Poirot the ruby that is named\nHeart of Fire is the centre stone in a necklace.",
    "There you are Didnt I tell you there is no end to the lies women\nwill tell about their jewellery This is a single stone hung on a\nplatinum chain round her neck but as I said before ten to one it\nis a bit of coloured glass.",
    "No said Poirot gently no  somehow I do not think it is coloured\nglass.",
    "Chapter 32\n\nKATHERINE AND POIROT COMPARE NOTES\n\nYou have changed Mademoiselle said Poirot suddenly.",
    "He and\nKatherine were seated opposite each other at a small table at the\nSavoy.",
    "Yes you have changed he continued.",
    "In what way\n\nMademoiselle these nuances are difficult to express.",
    "I am older.",
    "Yes you are older.",
    "And by that I do not mean that the wrinkles\nand the crows feet are coming.",
    "When I first saw you\nMademoiselle you were a lookeron at life.",
    "You had the quiet\namused look of one who sits back in the stalls and watches the\nplay.",
    "And now\n\nNow you no longer watch.",
    "It is an absurd thing perhaps that I\nsay here but you have the wary look of a fighter who is playing a\ndifficult game.",
    "My old lady is difficult sometimes said Katherine with a smile\nbut I can assure you that I dont engage in deadly contests with\nher.",
    "You must go down and see her some day Monsieur Poirot.",
    "I\nthink you are one of the people who would appreciate her pluck\nand her spirit.",
    "There was a silence while the waiter deftly served them with\nchicken en casserole.",
    "When he had departed Poirot said\n\n\fYou have heard me speak of my friend Hastings  he who said\nthat I was a human oyster.",
    "Eh bien Mademoiselle I have met my\nmatch in you.",
    "You far more than I play a lone hand.",
    "Nonsense said Katherine lightly.",
    "Never does Hercule Poirot talk nonsense.",
    "It is as I say.",
    "Again there was a silence.",
    "Poirot broke it by inquiring\n\nHave you seen any of our Riviera friends since you have been\nback Mademoiselle\n\nI have seen something of Major Knighton.",
    "Aha Is that so\n\nSomething in Poirots twinkling eyes made Katherine lower hers.",
    "So Mr Van Aldin remains in London\n\nYes.",
    "I must try to see him tomorrow or the next day.",
    "You have news for him\n\nWhat makes you think that\n\nI  wondered that is all.",
    "Poirot looked across at her with twinkling eyes.",
    "And now Mademoiselle there is much that you wish to ask me I\ncan see that.",
    "And why not Is not the affair of the Blue Train our\nown Roman Policier\n\nYes there are things I should like to ask you.",
    "Eh bien\n\nKatherine looked up with a sudden air of resolution.",
    "What were you doing in Paris Monsieur Poirot\n\nPoirot smiled slightly.",
    "I made a call at the Russian Embassy.",
    "Oh.",
    "I see that that tells you nothing.",
    "But I will not be a human oyster.",
    "No I will lay my cards on the table which is assuredly a thing that\noysters do not do.",
    "You suspect do you not that I am not satisfied\nwith the case against Derek Kettering\n\nThat is what I have been wondering.",
    "I thought in Nice that you\nhad finished with the case.",
    "You do not say all that you mean Mademoiselle.",
    "But I admit\neverything.",
    "It was I  my researches  which placed Derek\nKettering where he is now.",
    "But for me the Examining Magistrate\nwould still be vainly trying to fasten the crime on the Comte de la\nRoche.",
    "Eh bien Mademoiselle what I have done I do not regret.",
    "I\nhave only one duty  to discover the truth and that way led\nstraight to Mr Kettering.",
    "But did it end there The police say yes\nbut I Hercule Poirot am not satisfied.",
    "He broke off suddenly.",
    "Tell me Mademoiselle have you heard\nfrom Mademoiselle Lenox lately\n\nOne very short scrappy letter.",
    "She is I think annoyed with me\nfor coming back to England.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "I had an interview with her the night that Monsieur Kettering was\narrested.",
    "It was an interesting interview in more ways than one.",
    "Again he fell silent and Katherine did not interrupt his train of\nthought.",
    "Mademoiselle he said at last I am now on delicate ground yet\nI will say this to you.",
    "There is I think someone who loves\nMonsieur Kettering  correct me if I am wrong  and for her sake well  for her sake I hope that I am right and the police are wrong.",
    "You know who that someone is\n\nThere was a pause then Katherine said Yes  I think I know.",
    "Poirot leant across the table towards her.",
    "I am not satisfied Mademoiselle no I am not satisfied.",
    "The facts\nthe main facts led straight to Monsieur Kettering.",
    "But there is one\nthing that has been left out of account.",
    "And what is that\n\nThe disfigured face of the victim.",
    "I have asked myself\nMademoiselle a hundred times Was Derek Kettering the kind of\nman who would deal that smashing blow after having committed\nmurder What end would it serve What purpose would it\naccomplish Was it a likely action for one of Monsieur Ketterings\ntemperament And Mademoiselle the answer to these questions\nis profoundly unsatisfactory.",
    "Again and again I go back to that one\npoint  why And the only things I have to help me to a solution of\nthe problem are these.",
    "He whipped out his pocketbook and extracted something from it\nwhich he held between his finger and thumb.",
    "Do you remember Mademoiselle You saw me take these hairs\nfrom the rug in the railway carriage.",
    "Katherine leant forward scrutinizing the hairs keenly.",
    "Poirot nodded his head slowly several times.",
    "They suggest nothing to you I see that Mademoiselle.",
    "And yet  I\nthink somehow that you see a good deal.",
    "I have had ideas said Katherine slowly curious ideas.",
    "That is\nwhy I ask you what you were doing in Paris Monsieur Poirot.",
    "When I wrote to you \n\nFrom the Ritz\n\nA curious smile came over Poirots face.",
    "Yes as you say from the Ritz.",
    "I am a luxurious person sometimes\n when a millionaire pays.",
    "The Russian Embassy said Katherine frowning.",
    "No I dont see\nwhere that comes in.",
    "It does not come in directly Mademoiselle.",
    "I went there to get\ncertain information.",
    "I saw a particular personage and I threatened\nhim  yes Mademoiselle I Hercule Poirot threatened him.",
    "With the police\n\nNo said Poirot drily with the Press  a much more deadly\nweapon.",
    "He looked at Katherine and she smiled at him just shaking her\nhead.",
    "Are you not just turning back into an oyster again Monsieur\nPoirot\n\nNo no I do not wish to make mysteries.",
    "See I will tell you\neverything.",
    "I suspect this man of being the active party in the sale\nof the jewels of Monsieur Van Aldin.",
    "I tax him with it and in the end\nI get the whole story out of him.",
    "I learn where the jewels were\nhanded over and I learn too of the man who paced up and down\noutside in the street  a man with a venerable head of white hair\nbut who walked with the light springy step of a young man  and I\ngive that man a name in my own mind  the name of Monsieur le\nMarquis.",
    "And now you have come to London to see Mr Van Aldin\n\nNot entirely for that reason.",
    "I had other work to do.",
    "Since I have\nbeen in London I have seen two more people  a theatrical agent\nand a Harley Street doctor.",
    "From each of them I have got certain\ninformation.",
    "Put these things together Mademoiselle and see if\nyou can make of them the same as I do.",
    "I\n\nYes you.",
    "I will tell you one thing Mademoiselle.",
    "There has been a\ndoubt all along in my mind as to whether the robbery and the\nmurder were done by the same person.",
    "For a long time I was not\nsure \n\nAnd now\n\n\fAnd now I know.",
    "There was a silence.",
    "Then Katherine lifted her head.",
    "Her eyes\nwere shining.",
    "I am not clever like you Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Half the things that you\nhave been telling me dont seem to me to point anywhere at all.",
    "The ideas that came to me came from such an entirely different\nangle \n\nAh but that is always so said Poirot quietly.",
    "A mirror shows\nthe truth but everyone stands in a different place for looking into\nthe mirror.",
    "My ideas may be absurd  they may be entirely different from\nyours but \n\nYes\n\nTell me does this help you at all\n\nHe took a newspaper cutting from her outstretched hand.",
    "He read\nit and looking up he nodded gravely.",
    "As I told you Mademoiselle one stands at a different angle for\nlooking into the mirror but it is the same mirror and the same\nthings are reflected there.",
    "Katherine got up.",
    "I must rush she said.",
    "I have only just time to\ncatch my train Monsieur Poirot \n\n\fYes Mademoiselle.",
    "It  it mustnt be much longer you understand.",
    "I  I cant go on\nmuch longer.",
    "There was a break in her voice.",
    "He patted her hand reassuringly.",
    "Courage Mademoiselle you must not fail now the end is very\nnear.",
    "Chapter 33\n\nA NEW THEORY\n\nMonsieur Poirot wants to see you sir.",
    "Damn the fellow said Van Aldin.",
    "Knighton remained sympathetically silent.",
    "Van Aldin got up from\nhis chair and paced up and down.",
    "I suppose you have seen the cursed newspapers this morning\n\nI have glanced at them sir.",
    "Still at it hammer and tongs\n\nI am afraid so sir.",
    "The millionaire sat down again and pressed his hand to his\nforehead.",
    "If I had had an idea of this he groaned.",
    "I wish to God I had\nnever got that little Belgian to ferret out the truth.",
    "Find Ruths\nmurderer  that was all I thought about.",
    "You wouldnt have liked your soninlaw to go scot free\n\nVan Aldin sighed.",
    "I would have preferred to take the law into my own hands.",
    "I dont think that would have been a very wise proceeding sir.",
    "All the same  are you sure the fellow wants to see me\n\nYes Mr Van Aldin.",
    "He is very urgent about it.",
    "Then I suppose he will have to.",
    "He can come along this morning if\nhe likes.",
    "It was a very fresh and debonair Poirot who was ushered in.",
    "He\ndid not seem to see any lack of cordiality in the millionaires\nmanner and chatted pleasantly about various trifles.",
    "He was in\n\n\fLondon he explained to see his doctor.",
    "He mentioned the name\nof an eminent surgeon.",
    "No no pas la guerre  a memory of my days in the police force a\nbullet of a rascally Apache.",
    "He touched his left shoulder and winced realistically.",
    "I always consider you a lucky man Monsieur Van Aldin you are\nnot like our popular idea of American millionaires martyrs to the\ndyspepsia.",
    "I am pretty tough said Van Aldin.",
    "I lead a very simple life you\nknow plain fare and not too much of it.",
    "You have seen something of Miss Grey have you not inquired\nPoirot innocently turning to the secretary.",
    "I  yes once or twice said Knighton.",
    "He blushed slightly and Van Aldin exclaimed in surprise\n\nFunny you never mentioned to me that you had seen her\nKnighton\n\nI didnt think you would be interested sir.",
    "I like that girl very much said Van Aldin.",
    "It is a thousand pities that she should have buried herself once\nmore in St Mary Mead said Poirot.",
    "It is very fine of her said Knighton hotly.",
    "There are very few\npeople who would bury themselves down there to look after a\ncantankerous old woman who has no earthly claim on her.",
    "I am silent said Poirot his eyes twinkling a little but all the\nsame I say it is a pity.",
    "And now Messieurs let us come to\nbusiness.",
    "Both the other men looked at him in some surprise.",
    "You must not be shocked or alarmed at what I am about to say.",
    "Supposing Monsieur Van Aldin that after all Monsieur Derek\nKettering did not murder his wife\n\nWhat\n\nBoth men stared at him in blank surprise.",
    "Supposing I say that Monsieur Derek Kettering did not murder\nhis wife\n\nAre you mad Monsieur Poirot\n\nIt was Van Aldin who spoke.",
    "No said Poirot I am not mad.",
    "I am eccentric perhaps  at least\ncertain people say so but as regards my profession I am very\n\n\fmuch as one says all there.",
    "I ask you Monsieur Van Aldin\nwhether you would be glad or sorry if what I tell you should be the\ncase\n\nVan Aldin stared at him.",
    "Naturally I should be glad he said at\nlast.",
    "Is this an exercise in suppositions Monsieur Poirot or are\nthere any facts behind it\n\nPoirot looked at the ceiling.",
    "There is an offchance he said quietly that it might be the\nComte de la Roche after all.",
    "At least I have succeeded in upsetting\nhis alibi.",
    "How did you manage that\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders modestly.",
    "I have my own methods.",
    "The exercise of a little tact a little\ncleverness  and the thing is done.",
    "But the rubies said Van Aldin these rubies that the Count had\nin his possession were false.",
    "And clearly he would not have committed the crime except for\nthe rubies.",
    "But you are overlooking one point Monsieur Van Aldin.",
    "Where the rubies were concerned someone might have been\nbefore him.",
    "But this is an entirely new theory cried Knighton.",
    "Do you really believe all this rigmarole Monsieur Poirot\ndemanded the millionaire.",
    "The thing is not proved said Poirot quietly.",
    "It is as yet only a\ntheory but I tell you this Monsieur Van Aldin the facts are worth\ninvestigating.",
    "You must come out with me to the south of France\nand go into the case on the spot.",
    "You really think this is necessary  that I should go I mean.",
    "I thought it would be what you yourself would wish said Poirot.",
    "There was a hint of reproach in his tone which was not lost upon\nthe other.",
    "Yes yes of course he said.",
    "When do you wish to start\nMonsieur Poirot\n\nYou are very busy at present sir murmured Knighton.",
    "But the millionaire had now made up his mind and he waved the\nothers objections aside.",
    "I guess this business comes first he said.",
    "All right Monsieur\nPoirot tomorrow.",
    "What train\n\nWe will go I think by the Blue Train said Poirot and he smiled.",
    "Chapter 34\n\nTHE BLUE TRAIN AGAIN\n\nThe millionaires train as it is sometimes called swung round a\ncurve of line at what seemed a dangerous speed.",
    "Van Aldin\nKnighton and Poirot sat together in silence.",
    "Knighton and Van Aldin had two compartments connecting with\neach other as Ruth Kettering and her maid had had on the fateful\njourney.",
    "Poirots own compartment was further along the coach.",
    "The journey was a painful one for Van Aldin recalling as it did the\nmost agonizing memories.",
    "Poirot and Knighton conversed\noccasionally in low tones without disturbing him.",
    "When however the train had completed its slow journey round\nthe ceinture and reached the Gare de Lyon Poirot became\nsuddenly galvanized into activity.",
    "Van Aldin realized that part of\nhis object in travelling by the train had been to attempt to\nreconstruct the crime.",
    "Poirot himself acted every part.",
    "He was in\nturn the maid hurriedly shut into her own compartment Mrs\nKettering recognizing her husband with surprise and a trace of\nanxiety and Derek Kettering discovering that his wife was\ntravelling on the train.",
    "He tested various possibilities such as the\nbest way for a person to conceal himself in the second\ncompartment.",
    "Then suddenly an idea seemed to strike him.",
    "He clutched at Van\nAldins arm.",
    "Mon Dieu but that is something I have not thought of We must\nbreak our journey in Paris.",
    "Quick quick let us alight at once.",
    "Seizing suitcases he hurried from the train.",
    "Van Aldin and\nKnighton bewildered but obedient followed him.",
    "Van Aldin having\nonce formed his opinion of Poirots ability was slow to part from it.",
    "At the barrier they were held up.",
    "Their tickets were in charge of\nthe conductor of the train a fact which all three of them had\nforgotten.",
    "Poirots explanations were rapid fluent and impassioned but\nthey produced no effect upon the stolidfaced official.",
    "Let us get quit of this said Van Aldin abruptly.",
    "I gather you are\nin a hurry Monsieur Poirot.",
    "For Gods sake pay the fares from\nCalais and let us get right on with whatever you have got in your\nmind.",
    "But Poirots flood of language had suddenly stopped dead and he\nhad the appearance of a man turned to stone.",
    "His arm still\noutflung in an impassioned gesture remained there as though\nstricken with paralysis.",
    "I have been an imbecile he said simply.",
    "Ma foi I lose my head\nnowadays.",
    "Let us return and continue our journey quietly.",
    "With\nreasonable luck the train will not have gone.",
    "They were only just in time the train moving off as Knighton the\nlast of the three swung himself and his suitcase on board.",
    "The conductor remonstrated with them feelingly and assisted\nthem to carry their luggage back to their compartments.",
    "Van Aldin\nsaid\n\nnothing\n\nbut\n\nhe\n\nwas\n\nclearly\n\ndisgusted\n\nat\n\nPoirots\n\nextraordinary conduct.",
    "Alone with Knighton for a moment or two he remarked\n\nThis is a wild goose chase.",
    "The man has lost his grip on things.",
    "He has got brains up to a point but any man who loses his head\nand scuttles round like a frightened rabbit is no earthly darned\ngood.",
    "Poirot came to them in a moment or two full of abject apologies\nand clearly so crestfallen that harsh words would have been\nsuperfluous.",
    "Van Aldin received his apologies gravely but managed to restrain\nhimself from making acid comments.",
    "They had dinner on the train and afterwards somewhat to the\nsurprise of the other two Poirot suggested that they should all\nthree sit up in Van Aldins compartment.",
    "The millionaire looked at him curiously.",
    "Is there anything that you are keeping back from us Monsieur\nPoirot\n\n\fI Poirot opened his eyes in innocent surprise.",
    "But what an\nidea.",
    "Van Aldin did not answer but he was not satisfied.",
    "The conductor\nwas told that he need not make up the beds.",
    "Any surprise he might\nhave felt was obliterated by the largeness of the tip which Van\nAldin handed to him.",
    "The three men sat in silence.",
    "Poirot fidgeted\nand seemed restless.",
    "Presently he turned to the secretary.",
    "Major Knighton is the door of your compartment bolted The\ndoor into the corridor I mean.",
    "Yes I bolted it myself just now.",
    "Are you sure said Poirot.",
    "I will go and make sure if you like said Knighton smiling.",
    "No no do not derange yourself.",
    "I will see for myself.",
    "He passed through the connecting door and returned in a second\nor two nodding his head.",
    "Yes yes it is as you said.",
    "You must pardon an old mans fussy\nways.",
    "He closed the connecting door and resumed his place in the righthand corner.",
    "The hours passed.",
    "The three men dozed fitfully waking with\nuncomfortable starts.",
    "Probably never before had three people booked berths on the\nmost luxurious train available then declined to avail themselves of\nthe accommodation they had paid for.",
    "Every now and then Poirot glanced at his watch and then nodded\nhis head and composed himself to slumber once more.",
    "On one\noccasion he rose from his seat and opened the connecting door\npeered sharply into the adjoining compartment and then returned\nto his seat shaking his head.",
    "What is the matter whispered Knighton.",
    "You are expecting\nsomething to happen arent you\n\nI have the nerves confessed Poirot.",
    "I am like the cat upon the\nhot tiles.",
    "Every little noise it makes me jump.",
    "Knighton yawned.",
    "Of all the darned uncomfortable journeys he murmured.",
    "I\nsuppose you know what you are playing at Monsieur Poirot.",
    "He composed himself to sleep as best he could.",
    "Both he and Van\nAldin had succumbed to slumber when Poirot glancing for the\nfourteenth time at his watch leant across and tapped the\nmillionaire on the shoulder.",
    "Eh What is it\n\n\fIn five or ten minutes Monsieur we shall arrive at Lyons.",
    "My God Van Aldins face looked white and haggard in the dim\nlight.",
    "Then it must have been about this time that poor Ruth was\nkilled.",
    "He sat staring straight in front of him.",
    "His lips twitched a little his\nmind reverting back to the terrible tragedy that had saddened his\nlife.",
    "There was the usual long screaming sigh of the brake and the\ntrain slackened speed and drew into Lyons.",
    "Van Aldin let down the\nwindow and leant out.",
    "If it wasnt Derek  if your new theory is correct it is here that the\nman left the train he asked over his shoulder.",
    "Rather to his surprise Poirot shook his head.",
    "No he said thoughtfully no man left the train but I think  yes I\nthink a woman may have done so.",
    "Knighton gave a gasp.",
    "A woman demanded Van Aldin sharply.",
    "Yes a woman said Poirot nodding his head.",
    "You may not\nremember Monsieur Van Aldin but Miss Grey in her evidence\nmentioned that a youth in a cap and overcoat descended on to the\n\n\fplatform ostensibly to stretch his legs.",
    "Me I think that that youth\nwas most probably a woman.",
    "But who was she\n\nVan Aldins face expressed incredulity but Poirot replied\nseriously and categorically.",
    "Her name  or the name under which she was known for many\nyears  is Kitty Kidd but you Monsieur Van Aldin knew her by\nanother name  that of Ada Mason.",
    "Knighton sprang to his feet.",
    "What he cried.",
    "Poirot swung round to him.",
    "Ah  before I forget it.",
    "He whipped something from a pocket and\nheld it out.",
    "Permit me to offer you a cigarette  out of your own cigarettecase.",
    "It was careless of you to drop it when you boarded the train\non the ceinture at Paris.",
    "Knighton stood staring at him as though stupefied.",
    "Then he made\na movement but Poirot flung up his hand in a warning gesture.",
    "No dont move he said in a silky voice the door into the next\ncompartment is open and you are being covered from there this\n\n\fminute.",
    "I unbolted the door into the corridor when we left Paris\nand our friends the police were told to take their places there.",
    "As I\nexpect you know the French police want you rather urgently\nMajor Knighton  or shall we say  Monsieur le Marquis\n\nChapter 35\n\nEXPLANATIONS\n\nExplanations\n\nPoirot smiled.",
    "He was sitting opposite the millionaire at a luncheon\ntable in the latters private suite at the Negresco.",
    "Facing him was\na relieved but very puzzled man.",
    "Poirot leant back in his chair lit\none of his tiny cigarettes and stared reflectively at the ceiling.",
    "Yes I will give you explanations.",
    "It began with the one point that\npuzzled me.",
    "You know what that point was The disfigured face.",
    "It\nis not an uncommon thing to find when investigating a crime and it\nrouses an immediate question the question of identity.",
    "That\nnaturally was the first thing that occurred to me.",
    "Was the dead\nwoman really Mrs Kettering But that line led me nowhere for\nMiss Greys evidence was positive and very reliable so I put that\nidea aside.",
    "The dead woman was Ruth Kettering.",
    "When did you first begin to suspect the maid\n\n\fNot for some time but one peculiar little point drew my attention\nto her.",
    "The cigarettecase found in the railway carriage and which\nshe told us was one which Mrs Kettering had given to her\nhusband.",
    "Now that was on the face of it most improbable seeing\nthe terms that they were on.",
    "It awakened a doubt in my mind as to\nthe general veracity of Ada Masons statements.",
    "There was the\nrather suspicious fact to be taken into consideration that she had\nonly been with her mistress for two months.",
    "Certainly it did not\nseem as if she could have had anything to do with the crime since\nshe had been left behind in Paris and Mrs Kettering had been seen\nalive by several people afterwards but \n\nPoirot leant forward.",
    "He raised an emphatic forefinger and\nwagged it with intense emphasis at Van Aldin.",
    "But I am a good detective.",
    "I suspect.",
    "There is nobody and nothing\nthat I do not suspect.",
    "I believe nothing that I am told.",
    "I say to\nmyself how do we know that Ada Mason was left behind in Paris\nAnd at first the answer to that question seemed completely\nsatisfactory.",
    "There was the evidence of your secretary Major\nKnighton a complete outsider whose testimony might be\nsupposed to be entirely impartial and there was the dead\nwomans own words to the conductor on the train.",
    "But I put the\nlatter point aside for the moment because a very curious idea  an\nidea perhaps fantastic and impossible  was growing up in my\nmind.",
    "If by any outside chance it happened to be true that\nparticular piece of testimony was worthless.",
    "I concentrated on the chief stumblingblock to my theory.",
    "Major\nKnightons statement that he saw Ada Mason at the Ritz after the\n\n\fBlue Train had left Paris.",
    "That seemed conclusive enough but yet\non examining the facts carefully I noted two things.",
    "First that by a\ncurious coincidence he too had been exactly two months in your\nservice.",
    "Secondly his initial letter was the same  K. Supposing just supposing  that it was his cigarette case which had been\nfound in the carriage.",
    "Then if Ada Mason and he were working\ntogether and she recognized it when we showed it to her would\nshe not act precisely as she had done At first taken aback she\nquickly evolved a plausible theory that would agree with Mr\nKetterings guilt.",
    "Bien entendu that was not the original idea.",
    "The\nComte de la Roche was to be the scapegoat though Ada Mason\nwould not make her recognition of him too certain in case he\nshould be able to prove an alibi.",
    "Now if you will cast your mind\nback to that time you will remember a significant thing that\nhappened.",
    "I suggested to Ada Mason that the man she had seen\nwas not the Comte de la Roche but Derek Kettering.",
    "She seemed\nuncertain at the time but after I had got back to my hotel you rang\nme up and told me that she had come to you and said that on\nthinking it over she was now quite convinced that the man in\nquestion was Mr Kettering.",
    "I had been expecting something of the\nkind.",
    "There could be but one explanation of this sudden certainty\non her part.",
    "After my leaving your hotel she had had time to\nconsult with somebody and had received instructions which she\nacted upon.",
    "Who had given her these instructions Major\nKnighton.",
    "And there was another very small point which might\nmean nothing or might mean a great deal.",
    "In casual conversation\nKnighton had talked of a jewel robbery in Yorkshire in a house\nwhere he was staying.",
    "Perhaps a mere coincidence  perhaps\nanother small link in the chain.",
    "But there is one thing I do not understand Monsieur Poirot.",
    "I\nguess I must be dense or I would have seen it before now.",
    "Who\nwas the man in the train at Paris Derek Kettering or the Comte de\nla Roche\n\nThat is the simplicity of the whole thing.",
    "There was no man.",
    "Ah mille tonnerres  do you not see the cleverness of it all Whose\nword have we for it that there ever was a man there Only Ada\nMasons.",
    "And we believe in Ada Mason because of Knightons\nevidence that she was left behind in Paris.",
    "But Ruth herself told the conductor that she had left her maid\nbehind there demurred Van Aldin.",
    "Ah I am coming to that.",
    "We have Mrs Ketterings own evidence\nthere but on the other hand we have not really got her evidence\nbecause Monsieur Van Aldin a dead woman cannot give\nevidence.",
    "It is not her evidence but the evidence of the conductor\nof the train  a very different affair altogether.",
    "So you think the man was lying\n\nNo no not at all.",
    "He spoke what he thought to be the truth.",
    "But\nthe woman who told him that she had left her maid in Paris was not\nMrs Kettering.",
    "Van Aldin stared at him.",
    "Monsieur Van Aldin Ruth Kettering was dead before the train\narrived at the Gare de Lyon.",
    "It was Ada Mason dressed in her\n\n\fmistresss very distinctive clothing who purchased a dinner\nbasket and who made that very necessary statement to the\nconductor.",
    "Impossible\n\nNo no Monsieur Van Aldin not impossible.",
    "Les femmes they\nlook so much alike nowadays that one identifies them more by\ntheir clothing than by their faces.",
    "Ada Mason was the same height\nas your daughter.",
    "Dressed in that very sumptuous fur coat and the\nlittle red lacquer hat jammed down over her eyes with just a\nbunch of auburn curls showing over each ear it was no wonder\nthat the conductor was deceived.",
    "He had not previously spoken to\nMrs Kettering you remember.",
    "True he had seen the maid just for\na moment when she handed him the tickets but his impression\nhad been merely that of a gaunt blackclad female.",
    "If he had been\nan unusually intelligent man he might have gone so far as to say\nthat mistress and maid were not unlike but it is extremely unlikely\nthat he would even think that.",
    "And remember Ada Mason or Kitty\nKidd was an actress able to change her appearance and tone of\nvoice at a moments notice.",
    "No no there was no danger of his\nrecognizing the maid in the mistresss clothing but there was the\ndanger that when he came to discover the body he might realize it\nwas not the woman he had talked to the night before.",
    "And now we\nsee the reason for the disfigured face.",
    "The chief danger that Ada\nMason ran was that Katherine Grey might visit her compartment\nafter the train left Paris and she provided against that difficulty by\nordering a dinner basket and by locking herself in her\ncompartment.",
    "But who killed Ruth  and when\n\nFirst bear it in mind that the crime was planned and undertaken\nby the two of them  Knighton and Ada Mason working together.",
    "Knighton was in Paris that day on your business.",
    "He boarded the\ntrain somewhere on its way round the ceinture.",
    "Mrs Kettering\nwould be surprised but she would be quite unsuspicious.",
    "Perhaps\nhe draws her attention to something out the window and as she\nturns to look he slips the cord round her neck  and the whole\nthing is over in a second or two.",
    "The door of the compartment is\nlocked and he and Ada Mason set to work.",
    "They strip off the dead\nwomans outer clothes.",
    "Mason and Knighton roll the body up in a\nrug and put it on the seat in the adjoining compartment amongst\nthe bags and suitcases.",
    "Knighton drops off the train taking the\njewelcase containing the rubies with him.",
    "Since the crime is not\nsupposed to have been committed until nearly twelve hours later\nhe is perfectly safe and his evidence and the supposed Mrs\nKetterings words to the conductor will provide a perfect alibi for\nhis accomplice.",
    "At the Gare de Lyon Ada Mason gets a dinner basket and\nshutting herself into the toilet compartment she quickly changes\ninto her mistresss clothes adjusts two false bunches of auburn\ncurls and generally makes up to resemble her as closely as\npossible.",
    "When the conductor comes to make up the bed she tells\nhim the prepared story about having left her maid behind in Paris\nand whilst he is making up the berth she stands looking out of the\nwindow so that her back is towards the corridor and people\npassing along there.",
    "That was a wise precaution because as we\n\n\fknow Miss Grey was one of those passing and she among others\nwas willing to swear that Mrs Kettering was still alive at that hour.",
    "Go on said Van Aldin.",
    "Before getting to Lyons Ada Mason arranged her mistresss\nbody in the bunk folded up the dead womans clothes neatly on\nthe end of it and herself changed into a mans clothes and\nprepared to leave the train.",
    "When Derek Kettering entered his\nwifes compartment and as he thought saw her asleep in her\nberth the scene had been set and Ada Mason was hidden in the\nnext compartment waiting for the moment to leave the train\nunobserved.",
    "As soon as the conductor had swung himself down\non to the platform at Lyons she follows slouching along as\nthough just taking a breath of air.",
    "At a moment when she is\nunobserved she hurriedly crosses to the other platform and\ntakes the first train back to Paris and the Ritz Hotel.",
    "Her name has\nbeen registered there as taking a room the night before by one of\nKnightons female accomplices.",
    "She has nothing to do but wait\nthere placidly for your arrival.",
    "The jewels are not and never have\nbeen in her possession.",
    "Kettering had them.",
    "No suspicion\nattaches to him and as your secretary he brings them to Nice\nwithout the least fear of discovery.",
    "Their delivery there to\nMonsieur Papopolous is already arranged for and they are\nentrusted to Mason at the last moment to hand over to the Greek.",
    "Altogether a very neatly planned coup as one would expect from\na master of the game such as the Marquis.",
    "And you honestly mean that Richard Knighton is a wellknown\ncriminal who has been at this business for years\n\n\fPoirot nodded.",
    "One of the chief assets of the gentleman called the Marquis was\nhis plausible ingratiating manner.",
    "You fell a victim to his charm\nMonsieur Van Aldin when you engaged him as a secretary on\nsuch a slight acquaintanceship\n\nI could have sworn that he never angled for the post cried the\nmillionaire.",
    "It was very astutely done  so astutely done that it deceived a\nman whose knowledge of other men is as great as yours is.",
    "I looked up his antecedents too.",
    "The fellows record was\nexcellent.",
    "Yes yes that was part of the game.",
    "As Richard Knighton his life\nwas quite free from reproach.",
    "He was wellborn wellconnected\ndid honourable service in the war and seemed altogether above\nsuspicion but when I came to glean information about the\nmysterious Marquis I found many points of similarity.",
    "Knighton\nspoke French like a Frenchman he had been in America France\nand England at much the same time as the Marquis was operating.",
    "The Marquis was last heard of as engineering various jewel\nrobberies in Switzerland and it was in Switzerland that you had\ncome across Major Knighton and it was at precisely that time that\nthe first rumours were going round of your being in treaty for the\nfamous rubies.",
    "But why murder murmured Van Aldin brokenly.",
    "Surely a\nclever thief could have stolen the jewels without running his head\ninto a noose.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "This is not the first murder that lies to the\nMarquiss charge.",
    "He is a killer by instinct he believes too in\nleaving no evidence behind him.",
    "Dead men and women tell no\ntales.",
    "The Marquis had an intense passion for famous and historical\njewels.",
    "He laid his plans far beforehand by installing himself as\nyour secretary and getting his accomplice to obtain the situation\nof maid with your daughter for whom he guessed the jewels were\ndestined.",
    "And though this was his matured and carefully thoughtout plan he did not scruple to attempt a shortcut by hiring a\ncouple of Apaches to waylay you in Paris on the night you bought\nthe jewels.",
    "That plan failed which hardly surprised him I think.",
    "This plan was so he thought completely safe.",
    "No possible\nsuspicion could attach to Richard Knighton.",
    "But like all great men\n and the Marquis was a great man  he had his weaknesses.",
    "He\nfell genuinely in love with Miss Grey and suspecting her liking for\nDerek Kettering he could not resist the temptation to saddle him\nwith the crime when the opportunity presented itself.",
    "And now\nMonsieur Van Aldin I am going to tell you something very curious.",
    "Miss Grey is not a fanciful woman by any means yet she firmly\nbelieves that she felt your daughters presence beside her one\nday in the Casino Gardens at Monte Carlo just after she had been\nhaving a long talk with Knighton.",
    "She was convinced she says\nthat the dead woman was urgently trying to tell her something\nand it suddenly came to her that what the dead woman was trying\n\n\fto say was that Knighton was her murderer The idea seemed so\nfantastic at the time that Miss Grey spoke of it to no one.",
    "But she\nwas so convinced of its truth that she acted on it  wild as it\nseemed.",
    "She did not discourage Knightons advances and she\npretended to him that she was convinced of Derek Ketterings\nguilt.",
    "Extraordinary said Van Aldin.",
    "Yes it is very strange.",
    "One cannot explain these things.",
    "Oh by\nthe way there is one little point that baffled me considerably.",
    "Your\nsecretary has a decided limp  the result of a wound that he\nreceived in the war.",
    "Now the Marquis most decidedly did not limp.",
    "That was a stumblingblock.",
    "But Miss Lenox Tamplin happened to\nmention one day that Knightons limp had been a surprise to the\nsurgeons who had been in charge of the case in her mothers\nhospital.",
    "That suggested camouflage.",
    "When I was in London I\nwent to the surgeon in question and I got several technical details\nfrom him which confirmed me in that belief.",
    "I mentioned the name\nof that surgeon in Knightons hearing the day before yesterday.",
    "The natural thing would have been for Knighton to mention that he\nhad been attended by him during the war but he said nothing and that little point if nothing else gave me the last final\nassurance that my theory of the crime was correct.",
    "Miss Grey\ntoo provided me with a cutting showing that there had been a\nrobbery at Lady Tamplins hospital during the time that Knighton\nhad been there.",
    "She realized that I was on the same track as\nherself when I wrote to her from the Ritz in Paris.",
    "I had some trouble in my inquiries there but I got what I wanted evidence that Ada Mason arrived on the morning after the crime\nand not on the evening of the day before.",
    "There was a long silence then the millionaire stretched out a hand\nto Poirot across the table.",
    "I guess you know what this means to me Monsieur Poirot he\nsaid huskily.",
    "I am sending you round a cheque in the morning but\nno cheque in the world will express what I feel about what you\nhave done for me.",
    "You are the goods Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Every time\nyou are the goods.",
    "Poirot rose to his feet his chest swelled.",
    "I am only Hercule Poirot he said modestly yet as you say in\nmy own way I am a big man even as you also are a big man.",
    "I am\nglad and happy to have been of service to you.",
    "Now I go to repair\nthe damages caused by travel.",
    "Alas my excellent Georges is not\nwith me.",
    "In the lounge of the hotel he encountered a friend  the venerable\nMonsieur Papopolous his daughter Zia beside him.",
    "I thought you had left Nice Monsieur Poirot murmured the\nGreek as he took the detectives affectionately proffered hand.",
    "Business\n\ncompelled\n\nPapopolous.",
    "me\n\nto\n\nreturn\n\nmy\n\ndear\n\nMonsieur\n\n\fBusiness\n\nYes business.",
    "And talking of business I hope your health is\nbetter my dear friend\n\nMuch better.",
    "In fact we are returning to Paris tomorrow.",
    "I am enchanted to hear such good news.",
    "You have not completely\nruined the Greek exMinister I hope.",
    "I\n\nI understand you sold him a very wonderful ruby which  strictly\nentre nous  is being worn by Mademoiselle Mirelle the dancer\n\nYes murmured Monsieur Papopolous yes that is so.",
    "A ruby not unlike the famous Heart of Fire\n\nIt has points of resemblance certainly said the Greek casually.",
    "You have a wonderful hand with jewels Monsieur Papopolous.",
    "I\ncongratulate you.",
    "Mademoiselle Zia I am desolate that you are\nreturning to Paris so speedily.",
    "I had hoped to see some more of\nyou now that my business is accomplished.",
    "Would one be indiscreet if one asked what that business was\nasked Monsieur Papopolous.",
    "Not at all not at all.",
    "I have just succeeded in laying the Marquis\nby the heels.",
    "A\n\nfaraway\n\nlook\n\ncame\n\nover\n\nMonsieur\n\nPapopolous\n\nnoble\n\ncountenance.",
    "The Marquis he murmured now why does that seem familiar\nto me No  I cannot recall it.",
    "You would not I am sure said Poirot.",
    "I refer to a very notable\ncriminal and jewel robber.",
    "He has just been arrested for the\nmurder of the English lady Madame Kettering.",
    "Indeed How interesting these things are\n\nA polite exchange of farewells followed and when Poirot was out\nof earshot.",
    "Monsieur Papopolous turned to his daughter.",
    "Zia he said with feeling that man is the devil\n\nI like him.",
    "I like him myself admitted Monsieur Papopolous.",
    "But he is the\ndevil all the same.",
    "Chapter 36\n\nBY THE SEA\n\n\fThe mimosa was nearly over.",
    "The scent of it in the air was faintly\nunpleasant.",
    "There were pink geraniums twining along the\nbalustrade of Lady Tamplins villa and masses of carnations\nbelow sent up a sweet heavy perfume.",
    "The Mediterranean was at\nits bluest.",
    "Poirot sat on the terrace with Lenox Tamplin.",
    "He had\njust finished telling her the same story he had told to Van Aldin two\ndays before.",
    "Lenox had listened to him with absorbed attention\nher brows knitted and her eyes sombre.",
    "When he had finished she said simply And Derek\n\nHe was released yesterday.",
    "And he has gone  where\n\nHe left Nice last night.",
    "For St Mary Mead\n\nYes for St Mary Mead.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "I was wrong about Katherine said Lenox.",
    "I thought she did not\ncare.",
    "She is very reserved.",
    "She trusts no one.",
    "She might have trusted me said Lenox with a shade of\nbitterness.",
    "Yes said Poirot gravely she might have trusted you.",
    "But\nMademoiselle Katherine has spent a great deal of her life\nlistening and those who have listened do not find it easy to talk\nthey keep their sorrows and joys to themselves and tell no one.",
    "I was a fool said Lenox I thought she really cared for\nKnighton.",
    "I ought to have known better.",
    "I suppose I thought so\nbecause  well I hoped so.",
    "Poirot took her hand and gave it a little friendly squeeze.",
    "Courage Mademoiselle he said gently.",
    "Lenox looked very straight out across the sea and her face in its\nugly rigidity had for the moment a tragic beauty.",
    "Oh well she said at last it would not have done.",
    "I am too\nyoung for Derek he is like a kid that has never grown up.",
    "He\nwants the Madonna touch.",
    "There was a long silence then Lenox turned to him quickly and\nimpulsively.",
    "But I did help Monsieur Poirot  at any rate I did\nhelp.",
    "Yes Mademoiselle.",
    "It was you who gave me the first inkling of the\ntruth when you said that the person who committed the crime\nneed not have been on the train at all.",
    "Before that I could not see\nhow the thing had been done.",
    "Lenox drew a deep breath.",
    "I am glad she said at any rate  that is something.",
    "From far behind them there came a longdrawn scream of an\nengines whistle.",
    "That is that damned Blue Train said Lenox.",
    "Trains are\nrelentless things arent they Monsieur Poirot People are\nmurdered and die but they go on just the same.",
    "I am talking\nnonsense but you know what I mean.",
    "Yes yes I know.",
    "Life is like a train Mademoiselle.",
    "It goes on.",
    "And\nit is a good thing that that is so.",
    "Why\n\nBecause the train gets to its journeys end at last and there is a\nproverb about that in your language Mademoiselle.",
    "Journeys end in lovers meeting.",
    "Lenox laughed.",
    "That is not\ngoing to be true for me.",
    "Yes  yes it is true.",
    "You are young younger than you yourself\nknow.",
    "Trust the train Mademoiselle for it is le bon Dieu who\ndrives it.",
    "The whistle of the engine came again.",
    "Trust the train Mademoiselle murmured Poirot again.",
    "And\ntrust Hercule Poirot.",
    "He knows."
