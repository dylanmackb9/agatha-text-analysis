    "THREE ACT TRAGEDY\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\f1\nMr. Satterthwaite sat on the terrace of \u201cCrow\u2019s Nest\u201d and watched\nhis host Sir Charles Cartwright climbing up the path from the sea.",
    "Crow\u2019s Nest was a modern bungalow of the better type.",
    "It had no\nhalf timbering no gables no excrescences dear to a thirdclass\nbuilder\u2019s heart.",
    "It was a plain white solid building  deceptive as to\nsize since it was a good deal bigger than it looked.",
    "It owed its name\nto its position high up overlooking the harbour of Loomouth.",
    "Indeed from one corner of the terrace protected by a strong\nbalustrade there was a sheer drop to the sea below.",
    "By road\nCrow\u2019s Nest was a mile from the town.",
    "The road ran inland and then\nzigzagged high up above the sea.",
    "On foot it was accessible in seven\nminutes by the steep fisherman\u2019s path that Sir Charles Cartwright\nwas ascending at this minute.",
    "Sir Charles was a wellbuilt sunburnt man of middle age.",
    "He wore\nold grey flannel trousers and a white sweater.",
    "He had a slight\nrolling gait and carried his hands half closed as he walked.",
    "Nine\npeople out of ten would say \u201cRetired Naval man  can\u2019t mistake the\ntype.\u201d The tenth and more discerning would have hesitated\npuzzled by something indefinable that did not ring true.",
    "And then\nperhaps a picture would rise unsought the deck of a ship  but not\na real ship  a ship curtailed by hanging curtains of thick rich\nmaterial  a man Charles Cartwright standing on that deck light\nthat was not sunlight streaming down on him the hands half\n\n\fclenched the easy gait and a voice  the easy pleasant voice of an\nEnglish sailor and gentleman a great deal magnified in tone.",
    "\u201cNo sir\u201d Charles Cartwright was saying \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you\nany answer to that question.\u201d\nAnd swish fell the heavy curtains up sprang the lights an\norchestra plunged into the latest syncopated measure girls with\nexaggerated bows in their hair said Chocolates Lemonade The\nfirst act of The Call of the Sea with Charles Cartwright as\nCommander Vanstone was over.",
    "From his post of vantage looking down Mr. Satterthwaite smiled.",
    "A driedup little pipkin of a man Mr. Satterthwaite a patron of art\nand the drama a determined but pleasant snob always included in\nthe more important houseparties and social functions the word\n\u201cand Mr. Satterthwaite\u201d appeared invariably at the tail of a list of\nguests.",
    "Withal a man of considerable intelligence and a very\nshrewd observer of people and things.",
    "He murmured now shaking his head \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought it.",
    "No really I wouldn\u2019t have thought it.\u201d\nA step sounded on the terrace and he turned his head.",
    "The big\ngreyhaired man who drew a chair forward and sat down had his\nprofession clearly stamped on his keen kindly middleaged face.",
    "\u201cDoctor\u201d and \u201cHarley Street\u201d Sir Bartholomew Strange had\nsucceeded in his profession.",
    "He was a wellknown specialist in\nnervous disorders and had recently received a knighthood in the\nBirthday Honours list.",
    "He drew his chair forward beside that of Mr. Satterthwaite and said\n\u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t you have thought \u201c\nWith a smile Mr. Satterthwaite drew attention to the figure below\nrapidly ascending the path.",
    "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought Sir Charles would have remained\ncontented so long in  er  exile.\u201d\n\u201cBy Jove no more should I\u201d The other laughed throwing back his\nhead.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve known Charles since he was a boy.",
    "We were at Oxford\ntogether.",
    "He\u2019s always been the same  a better actor in private life\nthan on the stage Charles is always acting.",
    "He can\u2019t help it  it\u2019s\nsecond nature to him.",
    "Charles doesn\u2019t go out of a room  he \u2018makes\nan exit\u2019  and he usually has to have a good line to make it on.",
    "All the\nsame he likes a change of part  none better.",
    "Two years ago he\nretired from the stage  said he wanted to live a simple country life\nout of the world and indulge his old fancy for the sea.",
    "He comes\ndown here and builds this place.",
    "His idea of a simple country\ncottage.",
    "Three bathrooms and all the latest gadgets I was like you\nSatterthwaite I didn\u2019t think it would last.",
    "After all Charles is human\n he needs his audience.",
    "Two or three retired captains a bunch of\nold women and a parson  that\u2019s not much of a house to play to.",
    "I\nthought the \u2018simple fellow with his love of the sea\u2019 would run for\nsix months.",
    "Then frankly I thought he\u2019d tire of the part.",
    "I thought\nthe next thing to fill the bill would be the weary man of the world at\nMonte Carlo or possibly a laird in the Highlands  he\u2019s versatile\nCharles is.\u201d\n\n\fThe doctor stopped.",
    "It had been a long speech.",
    "His eyes were full of\naffection and amusement as he watched the unconscious man\nbelow.",
    "In a couple of minutes he would be with them.",
    "\u201cHowever\u201d Sir Bartholomew went on \u201cit seems we were wrong.",
    "The attraction of the simple life holds.\u201d\n\u201cA man who dramatises himself is sometimes misjudged\u201d pointed\nout Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cOne does not take his sincerities seriously.\u201d\nThe doctor nodded.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\nWith a cheerful halloo Charles Cartwright ran up the steps on to the\nterrace.",
    "\u201cMirabelle surpassed herself\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou ought to have come\nSatterthwaite.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite shook his head.",
    "He had suffered too often\ncrossing the Channel to have any illusions about the strength of his\nstomach afloat.",
    "He had observed the Mirabelle from his bedroom\nwindow that morning.",
    "There had been a stiff sailing breeze and Mr.\nSatterthwaite had thanked heaven devoutly for dry land.",
    "Sir Charles went to the drawingroom window and called for drinks.",
    "\u201cYou ought to have come Tollie\u201d he said to his friend.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you\nspend half your life sitting in Harley Street telling your patients how\ngood life on the ocean wave would be for them\u201d\n\u201cThe great merit of being a doctor\u201d said Sir Bartholomew \u201cis that\nyou are not obliged to follow your own advice.\u201d\n\n\fSir Charles laughed.",
    "He was still unconsciously playing his part the bluff breezy Naval man.",
    "He was an extraordinarily goodlooking\nman beautifully proportioned with a lean humorous face and the\ntouch of grey at his temples gave him a kind of added distinction.",
    "He looked what he was  a gentleman first and an actor second.",
    "\u201cDid you go alone\u201d asked the doctor.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d Sir Charles turned to take his drink from a smart parlourmaid\nwho was holding a tray.",
    "\u201cI had a \u2018hand.\u2019 The girl Egg to be exact.\u201d\nThere was something some faint trace of selfconsciousness in his\nvoice which made Mr. Satterthwaite look up sharply.",
    "\u201cMiss Lytton Gore She knows something about sailing doesn\u2019t\nshe\u201d\nSir Charles laughed rather ruefully.",
    "\u201cShe succeeds in making me feel a complete landlubber but I\u2019m\ncoming on  thanks to her.\u201d\nThought sipped quickly in and out of Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s mind.",
    "\u201cI wonder  Egg Lytton Gore  perhaps that\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t tired the age  a dangerous age  it\u2019s always a young girl at that time of\nlife \u2026 \u201d\nSir Charles went on \u201cThe sea  there\u2019s nothing like it  sun and wind\nand sea  and a simple shanty to come home to.\u201d\nAnd he looked with pleasure at the white building behind him\nequipped with three bathrooms hot and cold water in all the\nbathrooms the latest system of central heating the newest\n\n\felectrical fittings and a staff of parlourmaid housemaid chef and\nkitchenmaid.",
    "Sir Charles\u2019s interpretation of simple living was\nperhaps a trifle exaggerated.",
    "A tall and exceedingly ugly woman issued from the house and bore\ndown upon them.",
    "\u201cGood morning Miss Milray.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning Sir Charles.",
    "Good morning a slight inclination of\nthe head towards the other two.",
    "This is the menu for dinner.",
    "I don\u2019t know whether you would like it\naltered in any way.\u201d\nSir Charles took it and murmured\n\u201cLet\u2019s see.",
    "Melon Cantaloupe Bortch Soup Fresh Mackerel\nGrouse Souffl\u00e9 Surprise Canape Diane ... No I think that will do\nexcellently Miss Milray.",
    "Everyone is coming by the fourthirty\ntrain.\u201d\n\u201cI have already given Holgate his orders.",
    "By the way Sir Charles if\nyou will excuse me it would be better if I dined with you tonight.\u201d\nSir Charles looked startled but said courteously\n\u201cDelighted I am sure Miss Milray  but  er  \u201d\nMiss Milray proceeded calmly to explain.",
    "\u201cOtherwise Sir Charles it would make thirteen at table and so\nmany people are superstitious.\u201d\n\n\fFrom her tone it could be gathered that Miss Milray would have sat\ndown thirteen to dinner every night of her life without the slightest\nqualm.",
    "She went on\n\u201cI think everything is arranged.",
    "I have told Holgate the car is to\nfetch Lady Mary and the Babbingtons.",
    "Is that right\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.",
    "Just what I was going to ask you to do.\u201d\nWith a slightly superior smile on her rugged countenance Miss\nMilray withdrew.",
    "\u201cThat\u201d said Sir Charles reverently \u201cis a very remarkable woman.",
    "I\u2019m always afraid she\u2019ll come and brush my teeth for me.\u201d\n\u201cEfficiency personified\u201d said Strange.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s been with me for six years\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cFirst as my\nsecretary in London and here I suppose she\u2019s kind of glorified\nhousekeeper.",
    "Runs this place like clockwork.",
    "And now if you\nplease she\u2019s going to leave.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\u201cShe says  \u201d Sir Charles rubbed his nose dubiously \u201c  she says\nshe\u2019s got an invalid mother.",
    "Personally I don\u2019t believe it.",
    "That kind\nof woman never had a mother at all.",
    "Spontaneously generated from\na dynamo.",
    "No there\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\u201cQuite probably\u201d said Sir Bartholomew \u201cpeople have been\ntalking.\u201d\n\u201cTalking\u201d The actor stared.",
    "\u201cTalking  what about\u201d\n\n\f\u201cMy dear Charles.",
    "You know what talking means.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean talking about her  and me With that face And at her\nage\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably under fifty.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose she is\u201d Sir Charles considered the matter.",
    "\u201cBut\nseriously Tollie have you noticed her face It\u2019s got two eyes a\nnose and a mouth but it\u2019s not what you would call a face  not a\nfemale face.",
    "The most scandalloving old cat in the neighbourhood\ncouldn\u2019t seriously connect sexual passion with a face like that.\u201d\n\u201cYou underrate the imagination of the British spinster.\u201d\nSir Charles shook his head.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.",
    "There\u2019s a kind of hideous respectability about\nMiss Milray that even a British spinster must recognise.",
    "She is\nvirtue and respectability personified  and a damned useful woman.",
    "I always choose my secretaries plain as sin.\u201d\n\u201cWise man.\u201d\nSir Charles remained deep in thought for some minutes.",
    "To distract\nhim Sir Bartholomew asked\n\u201cWho\u2019s coming this afternoon\u201d\n\u201cAngie for one.\u201d\n\u201cAngela Sutcliffe That\u2019s good.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite leaned forward interestedly keen to know the\ncomposition of the house party.",
    "Angela Sutcliffe was a wellknown\n\n\factress no longer younger but with a strong hold on the public and\ncelebrated for her wit and charm.",
    "She was sometimes spoken of as\nEllen Terry\u2019s successor.",
    "\u201cThen there are the Dacres.\u201d\nAgain Mr. Satterthwaite nodded to himself.",
    "Mrs. Dacres was\nAmbrosine Ltd. that successful dressmaking establishment.",
    "You\nsaw it on programs  \u201cMiss Blank\u2019s dresses in the first act by\nAmbrosine Ltd. Brook Street.\u201d Her husband Captain Dacres was\na dark horse in his own racing parlance.",
    "He spent a lot of time on\nracecourses  had ridden himself in the Grand National in years\ngone by.",
    "There had been some trouble  nobody knew exactly though rumours had been spread about.",
    "There had been no inquiry\n nothing overt but somehow at mention of Freddie Dacres\npeople\u2019s eyebrows went up a little.",
    "\u201cThen there\u2019s Anthony Astor the playwright.\u201d\n\u201cOf course\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cShe wrote OneWay Traffic.",
    "I\nsaw it twice.",
    "It made a great hit.\u201d\nHe rather enjoyed the show that he knew that Anthony Astor was a\nwoman.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cI forget what her real name is Wills I think.",
    "I\u2019ve only met her once.",
    "I asked her to please Angela.",
    "That\u2019s the lot  of the houseparty I mean.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the locals\u201d asked the doctor.",
    "\u201cOh the locals Well there are the Babbingtons  he\u2019s the parson\nquite a good fellow not too parsonical and his wife\u2019s a really nice\n\n\fwoman.",
    "Lectures me on gardening.",
    "They\u2019re coming  and Lady\nMary and Egg.",
    "That\u2019s all.",
    "Oh yes there\u2019s a young fellow called\nManders he\u2019s a journalist or something.",
    "Goodlooking young\nfellow.",
    "That completes the party.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite was a man of methodical nature.",
    "He counted\nheads.",
    "\u201cMiss Sutcliffe one the Dacres three Anthony Astor four Lady\nMary and her daughter six the parson and his wife eight the\nyoung fellow nine ourselves twelve.",
    "Either you or Miss Milray must\nhave counted wrong Sir Charles.\u201d\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be Miss Milray\u201d said Sir Charles with assurance.",
    "\u201cThat\nwoman\u2019s never wrong.",
    "Let me see Yes by Jove you\u2019re right.",
    "I\nhave missed out one guest.",
    "He\u2019s slipped my memory.\u201d\nHe chuckled.",
    "\u201cWouldn\u2019t be best pleased at that either.",
    "The fellow is\nthe most conceited little devil I ever met.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite\u2019s eyes twinkled.",
    "He had always been of the\nopinion that the vainest men in creation were actors.",
    "He did not\nexempt Sir Charles Cartwright.",
    "This instance of the pot calling the\nkettle black amused him.",
    "\u201cWho is the egoist\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cRum little beggar\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cRather a celebrated little\nbeggar though.",
    "You may have heard of him.",
    "Hercule Poirot.",
    "He\u2019s a\nBelgian.\u201d\n\u201cThe detective\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cI have met him.",
    "Rather a\nremarkable personage.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019ve never met him\u201d said Sir Bartholomew \u201cbut I\u2019ve heard a good\ndeal about him.",
    "He retired some time ago though didn\u2019t he\nProbably most of what I\u2019ve heard is legend.",
    "Well Charles I hope we\nshan\u2019t have a crime this weekend.\u201d\n\u201cWhy Because we\u2019ve got a detective in the house Rather putting\nthe cart before the horse aren\u2019t you Tollie\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s by way of being a theory of mine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your theory doctor\u201d asked Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cThat events come to people  not people to events.",
    "Why do some\npeople have exciting lives and other people dull ones Because of\ntheir surroundings Not at all.",
    "One man may travel to the ends of\nthe earth and nothing will happen to him.",
    "There will be a massacre\na week before he arrives and an earthquake the day after he\nleaves and the boat that he nearly took will be shipwrecked.",
    "And\nanother man may live at Balham and travel to the City everyday\nand things will happen to him.",
    "He will be mixed up with blackmailing\ngangs and beautiful girls and motor bandits.",
    "There are people with\na tendency to shipwrecks  even if they go on a boat on an\nornamental lake something will happen to it.",
    "In the same way men\nlike your Hercule Poirot don\u2019t have to look for crime  it comes to\nthem.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite \u201cperhaps it is as well that\nMiss Milray is joining us and that we are not sitting down thirteen to\ndinner.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell\u201d said Sir Charles handsomely \u201cyou can have your murder\nTollie if you\u2019re so keen on it.",
    "I make only one stipulation  that I\nshan\u2019t be the corpse.\u201d\nAnd laughing the three men went into the house.",
    "2\n\nThe principal interest of Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s life was people.",
    "He was on the whole more interested in women than men.",
    "For a\nmanly man Mr. Satterthwaite knew far too much about women.",
    "There was a womanish strain in his character which lent him insight\ninto the feminine mind.",
    "Women all his life had confided in him but\nthey had never taken him seriously.",
    "Sometimes he felt a little bitter\nabout this.",
    "He was he felt always in the stalls watching the play\nnever on the stage taking part in the drama.",
    "But in truth the r\u00f4le of\nonlooker suited him very well.",
    "This evening sitting in the large room giving on to the terrace\ncleverly decorated by a modern form to resemble a ship\u2019s cabin de\nluxe he was principally interested in the exact shade of hair dye\nattained by Cynthia Dacres.",
    "It was an entirely new tone  straight\nfrom Paris he suspected  a curious and rather pleasing effect of\ngreenish bronze.",
    "What Mrs. Dacres really looked like it was\nimpossible to tell.",
    "She was a tall woman with a figure perfectly\ndisciplined to the demands of the moment.",
    "Her neck and arms were\nher usual shade of summer tan for the country  whether naturally\nor artificially produced it was impossible to tell.",
    "The greenish\nbronze hair was set in a clever and novel style that only London\u2019s\nbest hairdresser could achieve.",
    "Her plucked eyebrows darkened\n\n\flashes exquisitely madeup face and mouth lipsticked to a curve\nthat its naturally straight line did not possess seemed all adjuncts\nto the perfection of her evening gown of a deed and unusual blue\ncut very simply it seemed though this was ludicrously far from the\ncase and of an unusual material  dull but with hidden lights in it.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a clever woman\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite eyeing her with\napproval.",
    "\u201cI wonder what she\u2019s really like.\u201d\nBut this time he meant in mind not in body.",
    "Her words came drawlingly in the mode of the moment.",
    "\u201cMy dear it wasn\u2019t possible.",
    "I mean things either are possible or\nthey\u2019re not.",
    "This wasn\u2019t.",
    "It was simply penetrating.\u201d\nThat was the new word just now  everything was \u201cpenetrating\u201d.",
    "Sir Charles was vigorously shaking cocktails and talking to Angela\nSutcliffe a tall greyhaired woman with a mischievous mouth and\nfine eyes.",
    "Dacres was talking to Bartholomew Strange.",
    "\u201cEveryone knows what\u2019s wrong with old Ladisbourne.",
    "The whole\nstable knows.\u201d\nHe spoke in a high clipped voice  a little red foxy man with a short\nmoustache and slightly shifty eyes.",
    "Beside Mr. Satterthwaite sat Miss Wills whose play OneWay\nTraffic had been acclaimed as one of the most witty and daring\nseen in London for some years.",
    "Miss Wills was tall and thin with a\nreceding chin and very badly waved fair hair.",
    "She wore pincenez\n\n\fand was dressed in exceedingly limp green chiffon.",
    "Her voice was\nhigh and undistinguished.",
    "\u201cI went to the South of France\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cBut really I didn\u2019t enjoy\nit very much.",
    "Not friendly at all.",
    "But of course it\u2019s useful to me in my\nwork  to see all the goings on you know.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite thought \u201cPoor soul.",
    "Cut off by success from her\nspiritual home  a boarding house in Bournemouth.",
    "That\u2019s where\nshe\u2019d like to be.\u201d He marvelled at the difference between written\nworks and their authors.",
    "That cultivated \u201cmanoftheworld\u201d tone\nthat Anthony Astor imparted to his plays  what faintest spark of it\ncould be perceived in Miss Wills Then he noticed that the paleblue\neyes behind the pincenez were singularly intelligent.",
    "They were\nturned on him now with an appraising look that slightly\ndisconcerted him.",
    "It was as though Miss Wills were painstaking\nlearning him by heart.",
    "Sir Charles was just pouring out the cocktails.",
    "\u201cLet me get you a cocktail\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite springing up.",
    "Miss Wills giggled.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do\u201d she said.",
    "The door opened and Temple announced Lady Mary Lytton Gore\nand Mr. and Mrs. Babbington and Miss Lytton Gore.",
    "As has been\nstated before he had a weakness for titles.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite supplied Miss Wills with her cocktail and then\nsidled into the neighbourhood of Lady Mary Lytton Gore.",
    "As has\nbeen stated before he had a weakness for titles.",
    "Also apart from snobbishness he liked a gentlewoman and that\nLady Mary most undeniably was.",
    "Left as a widow very badly off with a child of three she had come to\nLoomouth and taken a small cottage where she had lived with one\ndevoted maid ever since.",
    "She was a tall thin woman looking older\nthan her fiftyfive years.",
    "Her expression was sweet and rather timid.",
    "She adored her daughter but was a little alarmed by her.",
    "Hermione Lytton Gore usually known for some obscure reason as\nEgg bore little resemblance to her mother.",
    "She was of a more\nenergetic type.",
    "She was not Mr. Satterthwaite decided beautiful\nbut she was undeniably attractive.",
    "And the cause of that attraction\nhe thought lay in her abounding vitality.",
    "She seemed twice as alive\nas anyone in that room.",
    "She had dark hair and grey eyes and was\nof medium height.",
    "It was something in the way the hair curled\ncrisply in her neck in the straight glance of the grey eyes in the\ncurve of the cheek in the infectious laugh that gave one that\nimpression of riotous youth and vitality.",
    "She stood talking to Oliver Manders who had just arrived.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t think why sailing bores you so much.",
    "You used to like it.\u201d\n\u201cEgg  my dear.",
    "One grows up.\u201d\nHe drawled the words raising his eyebrows.",
    "A handsome young fellow twentyfive at a guess.",
    "Something\nperhaps a little sleek about his good looks.",
    "Something else something  was it foreign Something unEnglish about him.",
    "Somebody else was watching Oliver Manders.",
    "A little man with an\neggshaped head and very foreignlooking moustaches.",
    "Mr.\nSatterthwaite had recalled himself to M. Hercule Poirot\u2019s memory.",
    "The little man had been very affable.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite suspected\nhim of deliberately exaggerating his foreign mannerisms.",
    "His small\ntwinkly eyes seemed to say \u201cYou expect me to be the buffoon To\nplay the comedy for you Bien  it shall be as you wish\u201d\nBut there was no twinkle now in Hercule Poirot\u2019s eyes.",
    "He looked\ngrave and a little sad.",
    "The Rev.",

    "\u201cNo as you say it\u2019s ridiculous.",

    "Now I did happen to notice he made a wry face when\ndrinking.",

    "But\nsupposing that Sir Bartholomew\u2019s tentative suggestion is correct that Mr. Babbington may for some reason have wished to commit\nsuicide.",
    "That does strike me as just possible whereas the\nsuggestion of murder seems quite ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cI feel that it is possible though not probable that Mr. Babbington\nintroduced somehow into that glass unseen by us.",

    "\u201cCan one ask a professional detective to detect\nYes a very nice point.\u201d\n\u201cJust an opinion\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "There was a gentle tap on the door and Hercule Poirot\u2019s face\nappeared peering in with an apologetic expression.",

    "Look\nhere do you think there\u2019s anything wrong about it\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "He said\n\u201cWrong How do you mean that  wrong\u201d\nBartholomew Strange said \u201cMy friend has got an idea into his head\nthat old Babbington was murdered.",
    "\u201cAnd you do not think so  eh\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to know what you think.\u201d\nPoirot said thoughtfully\n\u201cHe was taken ill of course very suddenly  very suddenly indeed.\u201d\n\u201cJust so.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite explained the theory of suicide and his own\nsuggestion of having a cocktail glass analysed.",
    "Poirot nodded approval.",
    "\u201cThat at any rate can do no harm.",
    "As a judge of human nature it\nseems to me unlikely in the extreme that anyone would wish to do\naway with a charming and harmless old gentleman.",
    "Still less does\nthe solution of suicide appeal to me.",
    "However the cocktail glass\nwill tell us one way or another.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the result of the analysis you think will be  what\u201d\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cMe I can only guess.",
    "You ask me to guess what will be the result\nof the analysis\u201d\n\u201cYes  \u201d\n\u201cThen I guess that they will find only the remains of a very excellent\ndry Martini.\u201d He bowed to Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cTo poison a man in a\ncocktail one of many handed round on a tray  well it would be a\ntechnique very  very  difficult.",
    "And if that charming old clergyman\nwanted to commit suicide I do not think he would do it at a party.",
    "That would show a very decided lack of consideration for others\nand Mr. Babbington struck me as a very considerate person.",
    "He\npaused.",
    "That since you ask me is my opinion.\u201d\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence.",
    "Then Sir Charles gave a deep sigh.",
    "He opened one of the windows and looked out.",
    "\u201cWind\u2019s gone round a point\u201d he said.",
    "The sailor had come back and the Secret Service detective had\ndisappeared.",
    "But to the observant Mr. Satterthwaite it seemed as though Sir\nCharles hankered slightly after the part he was not after all to\nplay.",
    "4\n\n\u201cYes but what do you think Mr. Satterthwaite Really think\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite looked this way and that.",

    "What did you think of the inquest\u201d\n\u201cIt all seemed quite  er  normal.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you think of Dr. MacDougal\u2019s evidence Frightfully\ntechnical and all that  close description of the organs  but didn\u2019t it\nstrike you that behind all that bombardment of words he was\nhedging What he said amounted to this that there was nothing to\n\n\fshow death had not arisen from natural causes.",
    "He didn\u2019t say it was\nthe result of natural causes.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you splitting hairs a little my dear\u201d\n\u201cThe point is that he did  he was puzzled but he had nothing to go\nupon so he had to take refuge in medical caution.",
    "What did Sir\nBartholomew Strange think\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite repeated some of the physician\u2019s dictums.",
    "\u201cPoohpoohed it did he\u201d said Egg thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cOf course he\u2019s a\ncautious man  I suppose a Harley Street big bug has to be.\u201d\n\u201cThere was nothing in the cocktail glass but gin and vermouth\u201d Mr.\nSatterthwaite reminded her.",

    "\u201cMy dear\u201d he said \u201cso many people are disgusting about so many\nthings.\u201d\n\u201cMost people are swine of course\u201d agreed Egg cheerfully.",

    "\u201cI suppose\u201d said Cartwright slowly \u201cthat I do.",
    "At least I don\u2019t\nsuspect them ...",
    "They just seem rather more possible than anyone\nelse.",
    "I don\u2019t know them very well for one thing.",
    "But for the life of\nme I can\u2019t see why Freddie Dacres who spends his life on the race\ncourse or Cynthia who spends her time designing fabulously\nexpensive clothes for women should have any desire to remove a\ndear insignificant old clergyman ... \u201d\nHe shook his head then his face brightened.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s the Wills woman.",
    "I forgot her again.",
    "What is there about\nher that continually makes you forget her She\u2019s the most\ndamnably nondescript creature I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite smiled.",
    "\u201cI rather fancy she might embody Burns\u2019s famous line  \u2018A chiel\u2019s\namang ye takin\u2019 notes.\u2019 I rather fancy that Miss Wills spend her time\n\n\ftaking notes.",
    "There are sharp eyes behind that pair of glasses.",
    "I\nthink you\u2019ll find that anything worth noticing in this affair has been\nnoticed by Miss Wills.\u201d\n\u201cDo you\u201d said Sir Charles doubtfully.",
    "\u201cThe next thing to do\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite \u201cis to have some\nlunch.",
    "After that we\u2019ll go out to the Abbey and see what we can\ndiscover on the spot.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to be taking very kindly to this Satterthwaite\u201d said Sir\nCharles with a twinkle of amusement.",
    "\u201cThe investigation of crime is not new to me\u201d said Mr.\nSatterthwaite.",
    "\u201cOnce when my car broke down and I was staying at\na lonely inn  \u201d\nHe got no further.",
    "\u201cI remember\u201d said Sir Charles in his high clear carrying actor\u2019s\nvoice \u201cwhen I was touring in 1921 ... \u201d\nSir Charles won.",
    "9\n\nNothing could have been more peaceful than the grounds and\nbuilding of Melfort Abbey as the two men saw it that afternoon in\nthe September sunshine.",
    "Portions of the Abbey were fifteenth\ncentury.",
    "It had been restored and a new wing added on to it.",
    "The\nnew Sanatorium was out of sight of the house with grounds of its\nown.",
    "Sir Charles and Mr. Satterthwaite were received by Mrs. Leckie the\ncook a portly lady decorously gowned in black who was tearful\nand voluble.",
    "Sir Charles she already knew and it was to him she\naddressed most of her conversation.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll understand I\u2019m sure sir what it\u2019s meant to me.",
    "The\nmaster\u2019s death and all.",
    "Policemen all over the place poking their\nnoses here and there  would you believe it even the dustbins they\nhad to have their noses in and questions  They wouldn\u2019t have\ndone with asking questions.",
    "Oh that I should have lived to see such\na thing  the doctor such a quiet gentleman as he always was and\nmade Sir Bartholomew too which a proud day it was to all of us as\nBeatrice and I well remember though she\u2019s been here two years\nless than I have.",
    "And such questions as that police fellow for\ngentleman I will not call him having been accustomed to gentlemen\nand their ways and knowing what\u2019s what fellow I say whether or\nno he is a superintendent  \u201d Mrs. Leckie paused took breath and\nextricated herself from the somewhat complicated conversational\nmorass into which she had fallen.",
    "\u201cQuestions that\u2019s what I say\nabout all the maids in the house and good girls they are every one\nof them  not that I\u2019d say that Doris gets up when she should do in\nthe morning.",
    "I have to speak about it at least once a week and\nVickie she\u2019s inclined to be impertinent but there with the young\nones you can\u2019t expect the training  their mothers don\u2019t give it to\nthem nowadays  but good girls they are and no police\nsuperintendent shall make me say otherwise.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 I said to him\n\u2018you needn\u2019t think I\u2019m going to say anything against my girls.",
    "They\u2019re good girls they are and as to having anything to do with\nmurder why it\u2019s rightdown wicked to suggest such a thing.\u201d\nMrs. Leckie paused.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Ellis now  that\u2019s different.",
    "I don\u2019t know anything about Mr.\nEllis and couldn\u2019t answer for him in any way he having been\nbrought from London and strange to the place while Mr. Baker\nwas on holiday.\u201d\n\u201cBaker\u201d asked Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Baker had been Sir Bartholomew\u2019s butler for the last seven\nyears sir.",
    "He was in London most of the time in Harley Street.",
    "You\u2019ll remember him sir\u201d She appealed to Sir Charles who\nnodded.",
    "\u201cSir Bartholomew used to bring him up here when he had a\nparty.",
    "But he hadn\u2019t been so well in his health so Sir Bartholomew\nsaid and he gave him a couple of months\u2019 holiday paid for him too\nin a place near the sea down near Brighton  a real kind gentleman\nthe doctor was  and he took Mr. Ellis on temporary for the time\nbeing and so as I said to that superintendent I can\u2019t say anything\nabout Mr. Ellis though from all he said himself he seems to have\nbeen with the best families and he certainly had a gentlemanly way\nwith him.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t find anything  unusual about him\u201d asked Sir Charles\nhopefully.",
    "\u201cWell it\u2019s odd your saying that sir because if you know what I\nmean I did and I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nSir Charles looked encouraging and Mrs. Leckie went on\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t exactly say what it was sir but there was something  \u201d\nThere always is  after the event  thought Mr. Satterthwaite to\nhimself grimly.",
    "However much Mrs. Leckie had despised the police\n\n\fshe was not proof against suggestion.",
    "If Ellis turned out to be the\ncriminal well Mrs. Leckie would have noticed something.",
    "\u201cFor one thing he was standoffish.",
    "Oh quite polite quite the\ngentleman  as I said he\u2019d been used to good houses.",
    "But he kept\nhimself to himself spent a lot of time in his own room and he was well I don\u2019t know how to describe it I\u2019m sure  he was well there\nwas something  \u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t suspect he wasn\u2019t  not really a butler\u201d suggested Mr.\nSatterthwaite.",
    "\u201cOh he\u2019d been in service right enough sir.",
    "The things he knew and about wellknown people in society too.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as\u201d suggested Sir Charles gently.",
    "But Mrs. Leckie became vague and noncommittal.",
    "She was not\ngoing to retail servants\u2019 hall gossip.",
    "Such a thing would have offended her sense of fitness.",
    "To put her at her ease Mr. Satterthwaite said\n\u201cPerhaps you can describe his appearance.\u201d\nMrs. Leckie brightened.",
    "\u201cYes indeed sir.",
    "He was a very respectablelooking man  sidewhiskers and grey hair stooped a little and he was growing stout it worried him that did.",
    "He had a rather shaky hand too but not\nfrom the cause you might imagine.",
    "He was a most abstemious man not like many I\u2019ve known.",
    "His eyes were a bit weak I think sir the\nlight hurt them  especially a bright light used to make them water\n\n\fsomething cruel.",
    "Out with us he wore glasses but not when he was\non duty.\u201d\n\u201cNo special distinguishing marks\u201d asked Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cNo scars\nOr broken fingers Or birth marks\u201d\n\u201cOh no sir nothing of that kind.\u201d\n\u201cHow superior detective stories are to life\u201d sighed Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cIn\nfiction there is always some distinguishing characteristic.\u201d\n\u201cHe had a tooth missing\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cI believe so sir I never noticed it myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was his manner on the night of the tragedy\u201d asked Mr.\nSatterthwaite in a slightly bookish manner.",
    "\u201cWell really sir I couldn\u2019t say.",
    "I was busy you see in my kitchen.",
    "I\nhadn\u2019t time for noticing things.\u201d\n\u201cNo no quite so.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the news came out that the master was dead we were struck\nall of a heap.",
    "I cried and couldn\u2019t stop and so did Beatrice.",
    "The\nyoung ones of course were excited like though very upset.",
    "Mr.\nEllis naturally wasn\u2019t so upset as we were he being new but he\nbehaved very considerate and insisted on Beatrice and me taking\na little glass of port to counteract the shock.",
    "And to think that all the\ntime it was he  the villain  \u201d\nWords failed Mrs. Leckie her eyes shone with indignation.",
    "\u201cHe disappeared that night I understand\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes sir went to his room like the rest of us and in the morning he\nwasn\u2019t there.",
    "That\u2019s what set the police on him of course.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes very foolish of him.",
    "Have you any idea how he left the\nhouse\u201d\n\u201cNot the slightest.",
    "It seems the police were watching the house all\nnight and they never saw him go  but there that\u2019s what the police\nare human like anyone else in spite of the airs they give\nthemselves coming into a gentleman\u2019s house and nosing round.\u201d\n\u201cI hear there\u2019s some question of a secret passage\u201d Sir Charles\nsaid.",
    "Mrs. Leckie sniffed.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what the police say.\u201d\n\u201cIs there such a thing\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard mention of it\u201d Mrs. Leckie agreed cautiously.",
    "\u201cDo you know where it starts from\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t sir.",
    "Secret passages are all very well but they\u2019re not\nthings to be encouraged in the servants\u2019 hall.",
    "It gives the girls\nideas.",
    "They might think of slipping out that way.",
    "My girls go out by\nthe back door and in by the back door and then we know where we\nare.\u201d\n\u201cSplendid Mrs. Leckie.",
    "I think you\u2019re very wise.\u201d\nMrs. Leckie bridled in the sun of Sir Charles\u2019s approval.",
    "\u201cI wonder\u201d he went on \u201cif we might just ask a few questions of the\nother servants\u201d\n\u201cOf course sir but they can\u2019t tell you anything more than I can.\u201d\n\u201cOh I know.",
    "I didn\u2019t mean so much about Ellis as about Sir\nBartholomew himself  his manner that night and so on.",
    "You see he\nwas a friend of mine.\u201d\n\u201cI know sir.",
    "I quite understand.",
    "There\u2019s Beatrice and there\u2019s Alice.",
    "She waited at table of course.\u201d\n\u201cYes I\u2019d like to see Alice.\u201d\nMrs. Leckie however had a belief in seniority.",
    "Beatrice Church\nthe upperhousemaid was the first to appear.",
    "She was a tall thin woman with a pinched mouth who looked\naggressively respectable.",
    "After a few unimportant questions Sir Charles led the talk to the\nbehaviour of the house party on the fatal evening.",
    "Had they all been\nterribly upset What had they said or done\nA little animation entered into Beatrice\u2019s manner.",
    "She had the usual\nghoulish relish for tragedy.",
    "\u201cMiss Sutcliffe she quite broke down.",
    "A very warmhearted lady\nshe\u2019s stayed here before.",
    "I suggested bringing her a little drop of\nbrandy or a nice cup of tea but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it.",
    "She took\nsome aspirin though.",
    "Said she was sure she couldn\u2019t sleep.",
    "But\nshe was sleeping like a little child the next morning when I bought\nher her early tea.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd Mrs. Dacres\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything would upset that lady much.\u201d\nFrom Beatrice\u2019s tone she had not liked Cynthia Dacres.",
    "\u201cJust anxious to get away she was.",
    "Said her business would suffer.",
    "She\u2019s a big dressmaker in London so Mr. Ellis told us.\u201d\nA big dressmaker to Beatrice meant \u201ctrade\u201d and trade she looked\ndown upon.",
    "\u201cAnd her husband\u201d\nBeatrice sniffed.",
    "\u201cSteadied his nerves with brandy he did.",
    "Or unsteadied them\nsome would say.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Lady Mary Lytton Gore\u201d\n\u201cA very nice lady\u201d said Beatrice her tone softening.",
    "\u201cMy great aunt\nwas in service with her father at the Castle.",
    "A pretty young girl she\nwas so I\u2019ve always heard.",
    "Poor she may be but you can see she\u2019s\nsomeone  and so considerate never giving trouble and always\nspeaking so pleasant.",
    "Her daughter\u2019s a nice young lady too.",
    "They\ndidn\u2019t know Sir Bartholomew well of course but they were very\ndistressed.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Wills\u201d\nSome of Beatrice\u2019s rigidity returned.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t say sir what Miss Wills thought about it.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOr what you thought about her\u201d asked Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cCome now\nBeatrice be human.\u201d\nAn unexpected smile dinted Beatrice\u2019s wooden cheeks.",
    "There was\nsomething appealingly schoolboyish in Sir Charles\u2019s manner.",
    "She\nwas not proof against the charm that nightly audiences had felt so\nstrongly.",
    "\u201cReally sir I don\u2019t know what you want me to say.\u201d\n\u201cJust what you thought and felt about Miss Wills.\u201d\n\u201cNothing sir nothing at all.",
    "She wasn\u2019t of course  \u201d\nBeatrice hesitated.",
    "\u201cGo on Beatrice.\u201d\n\u201cWell she wasn\u2019t quite the \u2018class\u2019 of the others sir.",
    "She couldn\u2019t\nhelp it I know went on Beatrice kindly.",
    "But she did things a real\nlady wouldn\u2019t have done.",
    "She pried if you know what I mean sir\npoked and pried about.\u201d\nSir Charles tried hard to get this statement amplified but Beatrice\nremained vague.",
    "Miss Wills had poked and pried but asked to\nproduce a special instance of the poking Beatrice seemed unable\nto do so.",
    "She merely repeated that Miss Wills pried into things that\nwere no business of hers.",
    "They gave it up at last and Mr. Satterthwaite said\n\u201cYoung Mr. Manders arrived unexpectedly didn\u2019t he\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes sir he had an accident with his car  just by the lodge gates it\nwas.",
    "He said it was a bit of luck its happening just here.",
    "The house\nwas full of course but Miss Lyndon had a bed made up for him in\nthe little study.\u201d\n\u201cWas everyone very surprised to see him\u201d\n\u201cOh yes sir naturally sir.\u201d\nAsked her opinion of Ellis Beatrice was noncommittal.",
    "She\u2019d seen\nvery little of him.",
    "Going off the way he did looked bad though why\nhe should want to harm the master she couldn\u2019t imagine.",
    "Nobody\ncould.",
    "\u201cWhat was he like the doctor I mean Did he seem to be looking\nforward to the house party Had he anything on his mind\u201d\n\u201cHe seemed particularly cheerful sir.",
    "Smiled to himself he did as\nthough he had some joke on.",
    "I even heard him make a joke with Mr.\nEllis a thing he\u2019d never done with Mr. Baker.",
    "He was usually a bit\nbrusque with the servants kind always but not speaking to them\nmuch.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he say\u201d asked Mr. Satterthwaite eagerly.",
    "\u201cWell I forget exactly now sir.",
    "Mr. Ellis had come up with a\ntelephone message and Sir Bartholomew asked him if he was sure\nhe\u2019d got the names right and Mr. Ellis said quite sure  speaking\nrespectful of course.",

    "Eh Beatrice what do you\nthink\u2019 And I was so surprised sir at the master speaking like that quite unlike his usual self  that I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd Ellis\u201d\n\u201cHe looked kind of disapproving sir as though it was the kind of\nthing he hadn\u2019t been used to.",
    "Stiff like.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the telephone message\u201d asked Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cThe message sir Oh it was from the Sanatorium  about a patient\nwho had arrived there and had stood the journey well.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember the name\u201d\n\u201cIt was a queer name sir.\u201d Beatrice hesitated.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "de\nRushbridger  something like that.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes\u201d said Sir Charles soothingly.",
    "\u201cNot an easy name to get\nright on the telephone.",

    "\u201cNot ordinary sir.",

    "He arranged the work different.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t think he poisoned your master.\u201d\n\u201cOh sir I don\u2019t see how he could have done.",
    "I was waiting at table\nwith him and he couldn\u2019t have put anything in the master\u2019s food\nwithout my seeing him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the drinks\u201d\n\u201cHe went round with the wine sir.",
    "Sherry first with the soup and\nthen hock and claret.",
    "But what could he have done sir If there\u2019d\nbeen anything in the wine he\u2019d have poisoned everybody  or all\nthose who took it.",

    "He had been about to\nsay that if Ellis was a professional criminal who had been detected\nby Sir Bartholomew and had murdered him in consequence the\nwhole affair would become unbearably dull.",
    "Just in time he\nremembered that Sir Bartholomew had been a friend of Sir Charles\nCartwright\u2019s and was duly appalled by the callousness of the\nsentiments he had nearly revealed.",
    "At first sight Ellis\u2019s room did not seem to offer much promise of\ndiscovery.",

    "The boots were neatly\npolished and arranged on trees.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite picked up a boot and murmured \u201cNines just so\nnines.\u201d But since there were no footprints in the case that didn\u2019t\nseem to lead anywhere.",
    "It seemed clear from its absence that Ellis had departed in his\nbutler\u2019s kit and Mr. Satterthwaite pointed out to Sir Charles that\nthat seemed rather remarkable fact.",
    "\u201cAny man in his senses would have changed into an ordinary suit.\u201d\n\u201cYes it\u2019s odd that ... Looks almost though that\u2019s absurd as if he\nhadn\u2019t gone at all ...",
    "Nonsense of course.\u201d\nThey continued their search.",
    "No letters no papers except a cutting\nfrom a newspaper regarding a cure for corns and a paragraph\nrelating to the approaching marriage of a duke\u2019s daughter.",
    "There was a small blottingbook and a penny bottle of ink on a side\ntable  no pen.",
    "Sir Charles held up the blottingbook to the mirror\nbut without result.",
    "One page of it was very much used  a\nmeaningless jumble and the ink looked to both men old.",
    "\u201cEither he hasn\u2019t written any letters since he was here or he hasn\u2019t\nblotted them\u201d deduced Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cThis is an old blotter.",
    "Ah yes  \u201d With some gratification he pointed to a barely\ndecipherable \u201cL.",
    "Baker\u201d amidst the jumble.",
    "\u201cI should say Ellis hadn\u2019t used this at all.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather odd isn\u2019t it\u201d said Sir Charles slowly.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\u201cWell a man usually writes letters ...\u201d\n\u201cNot if he\u2019s a criminal.\u201d\n\u201cNo perhaps you\u2019re right ...",
    "There must have been something fishy\nabout him to make him bolt as he did ... All we say is that he didn\u2019t\nmurder Tollie.\u201d\nThey hunted round the floor raising the carpet looking under the\nbed.",
    "There was nothing anywhere except a splash of ink beside the\nfireplace.",
    "The room was disappointingly bare.",
    "They left it in a somewhat disconcerted fashion.",
    "Their zeal as\ndetectives was momentarily damped.",
    "Possibly the thought passed through their minds that things were\narranged better in books.",
    "They had a few words with the other members of the staff scaredlooking juniors in awe of Mrs. Leckie and Beatrice church but they\nelicited nothing further.",
    "Finally they took their leave.",
    "\u201cWell Satterthwaite\u201d said Sir Charles as they strolled across the\npark Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s car had been instructed to pick them up\nat the lodge \u201canything strike you  anything at all\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite thought.",
    "He was not to be hurried into an answer\n especially as he felt something ought to have struck him.",
    "To\nconfess that the whole expedition had been a waste of time was an\nunwelcome idea.",
    "He passed over in his mind the evidence of one\nservant after another  the information was extraordinarily meagre.",
    "As Sir Charles had summed it up just now Miss Wills had poked and\npried Miss Sutcliffe had been very upset Mrs. Dacres had not been\nupset at all and Captain Dacres had got drunk.",
    "Very little there\nunless Freddie Dacres\u2019s indulgence showed the deadening of a\nguilty conscience.",
    "But Freddie Dacres Mr. Satterthwaite knew\nquite frequently got drunk.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d repeated Sir Charles impatiently.",
    "\u201cNothing\u201d confessed Mr. Satterthwaite reluctantly.",
    "\u201cExcept  well I\nthink we are entitled to assume from the clipping we found that Ellis\nsuffered from corns.\u201d\nSir Charles gave a wry smile.",
    "\u201cThat seems quite a reasonable deduction.",
    "Does it  er  get us\nanywhere\u201d\n\n\fMr. Satterthwaite confessed that it did not.",
    "\u201cThe only other thing \u201d he said and then stopped.",
    "\u201cYes Go on man.",
    "Anything may help.\u201d\n\u201cIt struck me as a little odd the way that Sir Bartholomew chaffed\nhis butler  you know what the housemaid told us.",
    "It seems\nsomehow uncharacteristic.\u201d\n\u201cIt was uncharacteristic\u201d said Sir Charles with emphasis.",
    "\u201cI knew\nTollie well  better than you did  and I can tell you that he wasn\u2019t a\nfacetious sort of man.",
    "He\u2019d never have spoken like that unless well unless for some reason he wasn\u2019t quite normal at the time.",
    "You\u2019re right Satterthwaite that is a point.",
    "Now where does it get\nus\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d began Mr. Satterthwaite but it was clear that Sir Charles\u2019s\nquestion had been merely a rhetorical one.",
    "He was anxious not to\nhear Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s views but to air his own.",
    "\u201cYou remember when that incident occurred Satterthwaite Just\nafter Ellis had brought him a telephone message.",
    "I think it\u2019s a fair\ndeduction to assume that it was that telephone message which was\ncause of Tollie\u2019s sudden unusual hilarity.",
    "You may remember I\nasked the housemaid woman what that message had been.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite nodded.",
    "\u201cIt was to say that a woman named Mrs. de Rushbridger had arrived\nat the Sanatorium\u201d he said to show that he too had paid attention\nto the point.",
    "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound particularly thrilling.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound so certainly.",
    "But if our reasoning is correct\nthere must be some significance in that message.\u201d\n\u201cYees\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite doubtfully.",
    "\u201cIndubitably\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find out what that\nsignificance was.",
    "It just crosses my mind that it may have been a\ncode message of some kind  a harmless sounding natural thing\nbut which really meant something entirely different.",
    "If Tollie had\nbeen making inquiries into Babbington\u2019s death this may have had\nsomething to do with those inquiries.",
    "Say even that he employed a\nprivate detective to find out a certain fact.",
    "He may have told him in\nthe event of this particular suspicion being justified to ring up and\nuse that particular phrase which would convey no hint of the truth\nto anyone taking it.",
    "That would explain his jubilation it might\nexplain his asking Ellis if he was sure of the name  he himself\nknowing well there was no such person really.",
    "In fact the slight\nlack of balance a person shows when they have brought off what\ncan be described as a long shot.\u201d\n\u201cYou think there\u2019s no such person as Mrs. de Rushbridger\u201d\n\u201cWell I think we ought to find out for certain.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u201d\n\u201cWe might run along to the Sanatorium now and ask the Matron.\u201d\n\u201cShe may think it rather odd.\u201d\nSir Charles laughed.",
    "\u201cYou leave it to me\u201d he said.",
    "They turned aside from the drive and walked in the direction of the\nSanatorium.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite said\n\u201cWhat about you Cartwright Does anything strike you at all\nArising out of our visit to the house I mean.\u201d\nSir Charles answered slowly.",
    "\u201cYes there is something  the devil of it is I can\u2019t remember what.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite stared at him in surprise.",
    "The other frowned.",
    "\u201cHow can I explain There was something  something which at the\nmoment struck me as wrong  as unlikely  only  I hadn\u2019t the time to\nthink about it then I put it aside in my own mind.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now you can\u2019t remember what it was\u201d\n\u201cNo  only that at some moment I said to myself \u2018That\u2019s odd.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWas it when we were questioning the servants Which servant\u201d\n\u201cI tell you I can\u2019t remember.",
    "And the more I think the less I shall\nremember ...",
    "If I leave it alone it may come back to me.\u201d\nThey came into view of the Sanatorium a big white modern\nbuilding divided from the park by palings.",
    "There was a gate\nthrough which they passed and they rang the frontdoor bell and\nasked for the Matron.",
    "The Matron when she came was a tall middleaged woman with\nan intelligent face and a capable manner.",
    "Sir Charles she clearly\nknew by name as a friend of the late Sir Bartholomew Strange.",
    "Sir Charles explained that he had just come back from abroad had\nbeen horrified to hear of his friend\u2019s death and of the terrible\nsuspicions entertained and had been up to the house to learn as\nmany details as he could.",
    "The Matron spoke in moving terms of the\nloss Sir Bartholomew would be to them and of his fine career as a\ndoctor.",
    "Sir Charles professed himself anxious to know what was\ngoing to happen to the Sanatorium.",
    "The Matron explained that Sir\nBartholomew had had two partners both capable doctors one was\nin residence at the Sanatorium.",
    "\u201cBartholomew was very proud of this place I know\u201d said Sir\nCharles.",
    "\u201cYes his treatments were a great success.\u201d\n\u201cMostly nerve cases isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThat reminds me  fellow I met out at Monte had some kind of\nrelation coming here.",
    "I forget her name now  odd sort of name Rushbridger  Rusbrigger  something like that.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "de Rushbridger you mean\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.",
    "Is she here now\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "But I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t be able to see you  not for some\ntime yet.",
    "She\u2019s having a very strict rest cure.",
    "The Matron smiled\njust a trifle archly.",
    "No letters no exciting visitors ... \u201d\n\u201cI say she\u2019s not very bad is she\u201d\n\n\f\u201cRather a bad nervous breakdown  lapses of memory and severe\nnervous exhaustion.",
    "Oh we shall get her right in time.\u201d\nThe Matron smiled reassuringly.",
    "\u201cLet me see haven\u2019t I heard Tollie  Sir Bartholomew  speak of\nher She was a friend of his as well as a patient wasn\u2019t she\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so Sir Charles.",
    "At least the doctor never said so.",
    "She\nhas recently arrived from the West Indies  really it was very funny\nI must tell you.",
    "Rather a difficult name for a servant to remember the parlourmaid here is rather stupid.",
    "She came and said to me\n\u2018Mrs.",
    "West India has come\u2019 and of course I suppose Rushbridger\ndoes sound rather like West India  but it was rather a coincidence\nher having just come from the West Indies.\u201d\n\u201cRather  rather  most amusing.",
    "Her husband over too\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s still out there.\u201d\n\u201cAh quite  quite.",
    "I must be mixing her up with someone else.",
    "It was\na case the doctor was specially interested in\u201d\n\u201cCases of amnesia are fairly common but they\u2019re always\ninteresting to a medical man  the variations you know.",
    "Two cases\nare seldom alike.\u201d\n\u201cSeems all very odd to me.",
    "Well thank you Matron I\u2019m glad to have\nhad a little chat with you.",
    "I know how much Tollie thought of you.",
    "He\noften spoke about you\u201d finished Sir Charles mendaciously.",
    "\u201cOh I\u2019m glad to hear that\u201d.",
    "The Matron flushed and bridled.",
    "\u201cSuch a\nsplendid man  such a loss to us all.",
    "We were absolutely shocked well stunned would describe it better.",
    "Murder Who ever would\n\n\fmurder Dr.",
    "Strange I said.",
    "It\u2019s incredible.",
    "That awful butler.",
    "I hope\nthe police catch him.",
    "And no motive or anything.\u201d\nSir Charles shook his head sadly and they took their departure\ngoing round by the road to the spot where the car awaited them.",
    "In revenge for his enforced quiescence during the interview with\nthe Matron Mr. Satterthwaite displayed a lively interest in the\nscene of Oliver Manders\u2019 accident plying the lodge keeper a slowwitted man of middle age with questions.",
    "Yes that was the place where the wall was broken away.",
    "On a\nmotor cycle the young gentleman was.",
    "No he didn\u2019t see it happen.",
    "He heard it though and come out to see.",
    "The young gentleman\nwas standing there  just where the other gentleman was standing\nnow.",
    "He didn\u2019t seem to be hurt.",
    "Just looking ruefullike at his bike and a proper mess that was.",
    "Just asked what the name of the place\nmight be and when he heard it was Sir Bartholomew Strange\u2019s he\nsaid \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of luck\u201d and went on up to the house.",
    "A very\ncalm young gentleman he seemed to be  tired like.",
    "How he come to\nhave such an accident the lodge keeper couldn\u2019t see but he\nsupposed them things went wrong sometimes.",
    "\u201cIt was an odd accident\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite thoughtfully.",
    "He looked at the wide straight road.",
    "No bends no dangerous\ncrossroads nothing to cause a motor cyclist to swerve suddenly\ninto a tenfoot wall.",
    "Yes an odd accident.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s in your mind Satterthwaite\u201d asked Sir Charles curiously.",
    "\u201cNothing\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite \u201cnothing.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIt\u2019s odd certainly\u201d said Sir Charles and he too stared at the\nscene of the accident in a puzzled manner.",
    "They got into the car and drove off.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite was busy with his thoughts.",
    "Mrs. de Rushbridger Cartwright\u2019s theory wouldn\u2019t work  it wasn\u2019t a code message there was such a person.",
    "But could there be something about the\nwoman herself Was she perhaps a witness of some kind or was it\njust because she was an interesting case that Bartholomew\nStrange had displayed this unusual elation Was she perhaps an\nattractive woman To fall in love at the age of fiftyfive did Mr.\nSatterthwaite had observed it many a time change a man\u2019s\ncharacter completely.",
    "It might perhaps make him facetious where\nbefore he had been aloof His thoughts were interrupted.",
    "Sir Charles leant forward.",
    "\u201cSatterthwaite\u201d he said \u201cdo you mind if we turn back\u201d\nWithout waiting for a reply he took up the speaking tube and gave\nthe order.",
    "The car slowed down stopped and the chauffeur began\nto reverse into a convenient lane.",
    "A minute or two later they were\nbowling along the road in the opposite direction.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d asked Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve remembered\u201d said Sir Charles \u201cwhat struck me as odd.",
    "It\nwas the inkstain on the floor in the butler\u2019s room.\u201d\n\n11\n\n\fMr. Satterthwaite stared at his friend in surprise.",
    "\u201cThe inkstain What do you mean Cartwright\u201d\n\u201cYou remember it\u201d\n\u201cI remember there was an inkstain yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou remember its position\u201d\n\u201cWell  not exactly.\u201d\n\u201cIt was close to the skirting board near the fireplace.\u201d\n\u201cYes so it was.",
    "I remember now.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you think that stain was caused Satterthwaite\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite reflected a minute or two.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big stain\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been an\nupset inkbottle.",
    "I should say in all probability that the man dropped\nhis fountain pen there  there was no pen in the room you\nremember.\u201d He shall see I notice things just as much as he does\nthought Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cSo it seems clear the man must have\nhad a fountain pen if he ever wrote at all  and there\u2019s no evidence\nthat he ever did.\u201d\n\u201cYes there is Satterthwaite.",
    "There\u2019s the inkstain.\u201d\n\u201cHe mayn\u2019t have been writing\u201d snapped Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cHe may\nhave just dropped the pen on the floor.\u201d\n\u201cBut there wouldn\u2019t have been a stain unless the top had been off\nthe pen.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI daresay you\u2019re right\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cBut I can\u2019t see\nwhat\u2019s odd about it.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps there isn\u2019t anything odd\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t tell till I\nget back and see for myself.\u201d\nThey were turning in at the lodge gates.",
    "A few minutes later they\nhad arrived at the house and Sir Charles was allaying the curiosity\ncaused by his return by inventing a pencil left behind in the butler\u2019s\nroom.",
    "\u201cAnd now\u201d said Sir Charles shutting the door of Ellis\u2019s room\nbehind them having with some skill shaken off the helpful Mrs.\nLeckie \u201clet\u2019s see if I\u2019m making an infernal fool of myself or whether\nthere\u2019s anything in my idea.\u201d\nIn Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s opinion the former alternative was by far the\nmore probable but he was much too polite to say so.",
    "He sat down\non the bed and watched the other.",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s our stain\u201d said Sir Charles indicating the mark with his\nfoot.",
    "\u201cRight up against the skirting board at the opposite side of the\nroom to the writingtable.",
    "Under what circumstances would a man\ndrop a pen just there\u201d\n\u201cYou can drop a pen anywhere\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cYou can hurl it across the room of course\u201d agreed Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cBut one doesn\u2019t usually treat one\u2019s pen like that.",
    "I don\u2019t know\nthough.",
    "Fountain pens are damned annoying things.",
    "Dry up and\nrefuse to write just when you want them to.",
    "Perhaps that\u2019s the\nsolution of the matter.",
    "Ellis lost his temper said \u2018Damn the thing\u2019\nand hurled it across the room.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI think there are plenty of explanations\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cHe may have simply laid the pen on the mantelpiece and it rolled\noff.\u201d\nSir Charles experimented with a pencil.",
    "He allowed it to roll off the\ncorner of the mantelpiece.",
    "The pencil struck the ground at least a\nfoot from the mark and rolled inwards towards the gas fire.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s your explanation\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to find one.\u201d\nFrom his seat on the bed Mr. Satterthwaite now witnessed a\nthoroughly amusing performance.",
    "Sir Charles tried dropping the pencil from his hand as he walked in\nthe direction of the fireplace.",
    "He tried sitting on the edge of the bed\nand writing there and then dropping the pencil.",
    "To get the pencil to\nfall on the right spot it was necessary to stand or sit jammed up\nagainst the wall in a most unconvincing attitude.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u201d said Sir Charles aloud.",
    "He stood considering\nthe wall the stain and the prim little gas fire.",
    "\u201cIf he were burning papers now\u201d he said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cBut one\ndoesn\u2019t burn papers in a gas fire  \u201d\nSuddenly he drew in his breath.",
    "A minute later Mr. Satterthwaite was realising Sir Charles\u2019s\nprofession to the full.",
    "Charles Cartwright had become Ellis the butler.",
    "He sat writing at\nthe writingtable.",
    "He looked furtive every now and then he raised\n\n\fhis eyes shooting them shiftily from side to side.",
    "Suddenly he\nseemed to hear something  Mr. Satterthwaite could even guess\nwhat that something was  footsteps along the passage.",
    "The man\nhad a guilty conscience.",
    "He attached a certain meaning to those\nfootsteps.",
    "He sprang up the paper on which he had been writing in\none hand his pen in the other.",
    "He darted across the room to the\nfireplace his head halfturned still alert  listening  afraid.",
    "He tried\nto shove the papers under the gas fire  in order to use both hands\nhe cast down the pen impatiently.",
    "Sir Charles\u2019s pencil the \u201cpen\u201d of\nthe drama fell accurately on the inkstain ...\n\u201cBravo\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite applauding generously.",
    "So good had the performance been that he was left with the\nimpression that so and only so could Ellis have acted.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d said Sir Charles resuming his own personality and\nspeaking with modest elation.",
    "\u201cIf the fellow heard the police or what\nhe thought was the police coming and had to hide what he was\nwriting  well where could he hide it Not in a drawer or under the\nmattress  if the police searched the room that would be found at\nonce.",
    "He hadn\u2019t time to take up a floorboard.",
    "No behind the gas\nfire was the only chance.\u201d\n\u201cThe next thing to do\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite \u201cis to see whether\nthere is anything hidden behind the gas fire.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "Of course it may have been a false alarm and he may\nhave got the things out again later.",
    "But we\u2019ll hope for the best.\u201d\n\n\fRemoving his coat and turning up his shirtsleeves Sir Charles lay\ndown on the floor and applied his eye to the crack under the gas\nfire.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s something under there\u201d he reported.",
    "\u201cSomething white.",
    "How can we get it out We want something like a woman\u2019s hatpins.\u201d\n\u201cWomen don\u2019t have hatpins any more\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite\nsadly.",
    "\u201cPerhaps a penknife.\u201d\nBut a penknife proved unavailing.",
    "In the end Mr. Satterthwaite went out and borrowed a knitting\nneedle from Beatrice.",
    "Though extremely curious to know what he\nwanted it for her sense of decorum was too great to permit her to\nask.",
    "The knitting needle did the trick.",
    "Sir Charles extracted half a dozen\nsheets of crumpled writingpaper hastily crushed together and\npushed in.",
    "With growing excitement he and Mr. Satterthwaite smoothed them\nout.",
    "They were clearly several different drafts of a letter  written in\na small neat clerkly handwriting.",
    "This is to say began the first that the writer of this does not wish to\ncause unpleasantness and may possibly have been mistaken in\nwhat he thought he saw tonight but \n\n\fHere the writer had clearly been dissatisfied and had broken off to\nstart afresh.",
    "John Ellis butler presents his compliments and would be glad of a\nshort interview touching the tragedy tonight before going to the\npolice with certain information in his possession \n\nStill dissatisfied the man had tried again.",
    "John Ellis butler has certain facts concerning the death of the\ndoctor in his possession.",
    "He has not yet given these facts to the\npolice \n\nIn the next one the use of the third person had been abandoned.",

    "If you will meet me \n\nThis letter broke off in a different way  after the \u201cme\u201d the pen had\ntailed off in a scrawl and the last five words were all blurred and\nblotchy.",
    "Clearly it was when writing this that Ellis had heard\nsomething that alarmed him.",

    "\u201cAnnoying we don\u2019t know\nwhich.",
    "Why couldn\u2019t the fellow begin one of his effusions Sir or\nMadam then we\u2019d know where we are.",
    "Ellis seems to have been an\nartistic sort of fellow.",
    "He was taking a lot of trouble over his\nblackmailing letter.",
    "If only he\u2019d given us one clue  one simple little\nclue  as to whom that letter was addressed.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cWe are getting on.",
    "You\nremember you said that what we wanted to find in this room was a\nproof of Ellis\u2019s innocence.",
    "Well we\u2019ve found it.",
    "These letters show\n\n\fthat he was innocent  of murder I mean.",
    "He was a thoroughpaced\nscoundrel in other ways.",
    "But he didn\u2019t murder Sir Bartholomew\nStrange.",
    "Somebody else did it that.",
    "Someone who murdered\nBabbington also.",
    "I think even the police will have to come round to\nour view now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell them about this\u201d\nSir Charles\u2019s voice expressed dissatisfaction.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t see that we can do otherwise.",
    "Why\u201d\n\u201cWell \u201d Sir Charles sat down on the bed.",
    "His brow furrowed itself in\nthought.",
    "\u201cHow can I put it best At the moment we know something\nthat nobody else does.",
    "The police are looking for Ellis.",
    "They think\nhe\u2019s the murderer.",
    "Everyone knows that they think he\u2019s the\nmurderer.",
    "So the real criminal must be feeling pretty good.",
    "He or\nshe will be not exactly off his or her guard but feeling  well\ncomfortable.",
    "Isn\u2019t it a pity to upset that state of things Isn\u2019t that\njust our chance I mean our chance of finding a connection\nbetween Babbington and one of these people.",
    "They don\u2019t know that\nanyone has connected this death with Babbington\u2019s death.",
    "They\u2019ll\nbe unsuspicious.",
    "It\u2019s a chance in a hundred.\u201d\n\u201cI see what you mean\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cAnd I agree with\nyou.",
    "It is a chance.",
    "But all the same I don\u2019t think we can take it.",
    "It\nis our duty as citizens to report this discovery of ours to the police\nat once.",
    "We have no right to withhold it from them.\u201d\nSir Charles looked at him quizzically.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re the pattern of a good citizen Satterthwaite.",
    "I\u2019ve no doubt\nthe orthodox thing must be done  but I\u2019m not nearly such a good\n\n\fcitizen as you are.",
    "I should have no scruples in keeping this find to\nmyself for a day or two  only a day or two  eh No Well I give in.",
    "let us be pillars of law and order.\u201d\n\u201cYou see\u201d explained Mr. Satterthwaite \u201cJohnson is a friend of\nmine and he was very decent about it all  let us into all the police\nwere doing  gave us full information and all that.\u201d\n\u201cOh you\u2019re right\u201d sighed Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cQuite right.",
    "Only after all\nno one but me thought of looking under that gas stove.",
    "The idea\nnever occurred to one of those thickheaded policeman ...",
    "But have\nit your own way.",
    "I say Satterthwaite where do you think Ellis is\nnow\u201d\n\u201cI presume\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite \u201cthat he got what he wanted.",
    "He was paid to disappear and he did disappear  most effectually.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cI suppose that is the explanation.\u201d\nHe gave a slight shiver.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t like this room Satterthwaite.",
    "Come out of it.\u201d\n\n12\n\nSir Charles and Mr. Satterthwaite arrived back in London the\nfollowing evening.",
    "The interview with Colonel Johnson had had to be very tactfully\nconducted.",
    "Superintendent Crossfield had not been too pleased\nthat mere \u201cgentlemen\u201d should have found what he and his\nassistants had missed.",
    "He was at some pains to save his face.",
    "\u201cVery creditable indeed sir.",
    "I confess I never thought of looking\nunder the gas fire.",
    "As a matter of fact it beats me what set you\nlooking there.\u201d\nThe two men had not gone into a detailed account of how theorising\nfrom an inkblot had led to the discovery.",
    "\u201cJust nosing around\u201d was\nhow Sir Charles had put it.",
    "\u201cStill look you did\u201d continued the Superintendent \u201cand were\njustified.",
    "Not that what you\u2019ve found is much surprise to me.",
    "You\nsee it stands to reason that if Ellis wasn\u2019t the murderer he must\nhave disappeared for some reason or other and it\u2019s been in the\nback of my mind all along that blackmail might have been his line of\nbusiness.\u201d\nOne thing did arise from their discovery.",
    "Colonel Johnson was\ngoing to communicate with the Loomouth police.",
    "The death of\nStephen Babbington ought certainly to be investigated.",
    "\u201cAnd if they find he died from nicotine poisoning even Crossfield\nwill admit the two deaths are connected\u201d said Sir Charles when\nthey were speeding towards London.",
    "He was still a little disgruntled at having had to hand over his\ndiscovery to the police.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite had soothed him by pointing out that the\ninformation was not to be made public or given to the press.",
    "\u201cThe guilty person will have no misgivings.",
    "The search for Ellis will\nstill be continued.\u201d\nSir Charles admitted that that was true.",
    "On arrival in London he explained to Mr. Satterthwaite he\nproposed to get in touch with Egg Lytton Gore.",
    "Her letter had been\nwritten from an address in Belgrave Square.",
    "He hoped that she\nmight still be there.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite gravely approved this course.",
    "He himself was\nanxious to see Egg.",
    "It was arranged that Sir Charles should ring her\nup as soon as they reached London.",
    "Egg proved to be still in town.",
    "She and her mother were staying\nwith relatives and were not returning to Loomouth for about a\nweek.",
    "Egg was easily prevailed upon to come out and dine with the\ntwo men.",
    "\u201cShe can\u2019t come here very well I suppose\u201d said Sir Charles\nlooking round his luxurious flat.",
    "\u201cHer mother mightn\u2019t like it eh Of\ncourse we could have Miss Milray too but I\u2019d rather not.",
    "To tell the\ntruth Miss Milray cramps my style a bit.",
    "She\u2019s so efficient that she\ngives me an inferiority complex.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite suggested his house.",
    "In the end it was arranged\nto dine at the Berkeley.",
    "Afterwards if Egg liked they could adjourn\nelsewhere.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite noticed at once that the girl was looking thinner.",
    "Her eyes seemed larger and more feverish her chin more decided.",
    "She was pale and had circles under her eyes.",
    "But her charm was as\ngreat as ever her childish eagerness just as intense.",
    "She said to Sir Charles \u201cI knew you\u2019d come ... \u201d\nHer tone implied \u201cNow that you\u2019ve come everything will be all right\n... \u201d\n\n\fMr. Satterthwaite thought to himself \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d\ncome she wasn\u2019t sure at all.",
    "She\u2019s been on tenterhooks.",
    "She\u2019s been\nfretting herself to death.\u201d And he thought \u201cDoesn\u2019t the man\nrealise Actors are usually vain enough ... Doesn\u2019t he know that\ngirl\u2019s head over ears in love with him\u201d\nIt was he thought an odd situation.",
    "That Sir Charles was\noverwhelmingly in love with the girl he had no doubt whatever.",
    "She\nwas equally in love with him.",
    "And the link between them the link to\nwhich each of them clung frenziedly was a crime a double crime of\na revolting nature.",
    "During dinner little was said.",
    "Sir Charles talked about his\nexperiences abroad.",
    "Egg talked about Loomouth.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite\nencouraged them both whenever the conversation seemed likely to\nflag.",
    "When dinner was over they went to Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s house.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s house was on Chelsea Embankment.",
    "It was a\nlarge house and contained many beautiful works of art.",
    "There were\npictures sculpture Chinese porcelain prehistoric pottery ivories\nminiatures and much genuine Chippendale and Hepplewhite\nfurniture.",
    "It had an atmosphere about it of mellowness and\nunderstanding.",
    "Egg Lytton Gore saw nothing noticed nothing.",
    "She flung off her\nevening coat on to a chair and said\n\u201cAt last.",
    "Now tell me all about it.\u201d\nShe listened with vivid interest white Sir Charles narrated their\nadventures in Yorkshire drawing in her breath sharply when he\ndescribed the discovery of the blackmailing letters.",
    "\u201cWhat happened after that we can only conjecture\u201d finished Sir\nCharles.",
    "\u201cPresumably Ellis was paid to hold his tongue and his\nescape was facilitated.\u201d\nBut Egg shook her head.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you see Ellis is dead.\u201d\nBoth men were startled but Egg reiterated her assertion.",
    "\u201cOf course he\u2019s dead.",
    "That\u2019s why he\u2019s disappeared so successfully\nthat no one can find a trace of him.",
    "He knew too much and so he\nwas killed.",
    "Ellis is the third murder.\u201d\nAlthough neither of the two men had considered the possibility\nbefore they were forced to admit that it did not entirely ring false.",
    "\u201cBut look here my dear girl\u201d argued Sir Charles \u201cit\u2019s all very well\nto say Ellis is dead.",
    "Where\u2019s the body There\u2019s twelve stone or so of\nsolid butler to be accounted for.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where the body is\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cThere must be lots of\nplaces.\u201d\n\u201cHardly\u201d murmured Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cHardly ... \u201d\n\u201cLots\u201d reiterated Egg.",
    "\u201cLet me see \u2026\u201d She paused for a moment.",
    "\u201cAttics there are masses of attics that no one ever goes into.",
    "He\u2019s\nprobably in a trunk in the attic.\u201d\n\u201cRather unlikely\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cBut possible of course.",
    "It\nmight evade discovery  for  er  a time.\u201d\n\n\fIt was not Egg\u2019s way to avoid unpleasantness.",
    "She dealt\nimmediately with the point in Sir Charles\u2019s mind.",
    "\u201cSmell goes up not down.",
    "You\u2019d notice a decaying body in the\ncellar much sooner than in the attic.",
    "And anyway for a long time\npeople would think it was a dead rat.\u201d\n\u201cIf your theory were correct it would point definitely to a man as\nthe murderer.",
    "A woman couldn\u2019t drag a body round the house.",
    "In\nfact it would be a pretty good feat for a man.\u201d\n\u201cWell there are other possibilities.",
    "There\u2019s a secret passage there\nyou know.",
    "Miss Sutcliffe told me so and Sir.",
    "Bartholomew told me\nhe would show it to me.",
    "The murderer might have given Ellis the\nmoney and shown him the way to get out of the house gone down\nthe passage with him and killed him there.",
    "A woman could do that.",
    "She could stab him or something from behind.",
    "Then she\u2019d just\nleave the body there and go back and no one would ever know.\u201d\nSir Charles shook his head doubtfully but he no longer disputed\nEgg\u2019s theory.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite felt sure that the same suspicion had come to him\nfor a moment in Ellis\u2019s room when they had found the letters.",
    "He\nremembered Sir Charles\u2019s little shiver.",
    "The idea that Ellis might be\ndead had come to him then ...\nMr. Satterthwaite thought \u201cIf Ellis is dead then we\u2019re dealing with\na very dangerous person ...",
    "Yes a very dangerous person ... \u201d And\nsuddenly he felt a cold chill of fear down his spine ...\nA person who had killed three times wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill again\n...",
    "They were in danger all three of them Sir Charles and Egg and he\n...",
    "If they found out too much ...",
    "He was recalled by the sound of Sir Charles\u2019s voice.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t understand in your letter Egg.",
    "You\nspoke of Oliver Manders being in danger of the police suspecting\nhim.",
    "I can\u2019t see that they attach the least suspicion to him.\u201d\nIt seemed to Mr. Satterthwaite that Egg was very slightly\ndiscomposed.",
    "He even fancied that she blushed.",
    "\u201cAha\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite to himself.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s see how you get out\nof this young lady.\u201d\n\u201cIt was silly of me\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cI got confused.",
    "I thought that Oliver\narriving as he did with what might have been a trumpedup excuse\nwell I thought the police were sure to suspect him.\u201d\nSir Charles accepted the explanation easily enough.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI see.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite spoke.",
    "\u201cWas it a trumpedup excuse\u201d he said.",
    "Egg turned to him.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\u201cIt was an odd sort of accident\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cI thought if\nit was a trumpedup excuse you might know.\u201d\n\n\fEgg shook her head.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "I never thought about it.",
    "But why should Oliver\npretend to have an accident if he didn\u2019t\u201d\n\u201cHe might have had reasons\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cQuite natural\nones.\u201d\nHe was smiling at her.",
    "Egg blushed crimson.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cNo.\u201d\nSir Charles sighed.",
    "It occurred to Mr. Satterthwaite that his friend\nhad interpreted that blush quite wrongly Sir Charles seemed a\nsadder and older man when he spoke again.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d he said \u201cif our young friend is in no danger where do I\ncome in\u201d\nEgg came forward quickly and caught him by the coat sleeve.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re not going away again.",
    "You\u2019re not going to give up You\u2019re\ngoing to find out the truth  the truth.",
    "I don\u2019t believe anybody but\nyou could find out the truth.",
    "You can.",
    "You will.\u201d\nShe was tremendously in earnest.",
    "The waves of her vitality seemed\nto surge and eddy in the oldworld air of the room.",
    "\u201cYou believe in me\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "He was moved.",
    "\u201cYes yes yes.",
    "We\u2019re going to get at the truth.",
    "You and I together.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Satterthwaite.\u201d\n\u201cOf course and Mr. Satterthwaite\u201d said Egg without interest.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite smiled covertly.",
    "Whether Egg wanted to include\nhim or not he had no intention of being left out.",
    "He was fond of\nmysteries and he liked observing human nature and he had a soft\nspot for lovers.",
    "All three tastes seemed likely to be gratified in this\naffair.",
    "Sir Charles sat down.",
    "His voice changed.",
    "He was in command\ndirecting a production.",
    "\u201cFirst of all we\u2019ve got to clarify the situation.",
    "Do we or do we not\nbelieve that the same person killed Babbington and Bartholomew\nStrange\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cDo we believe that the second murder sprang directly from the\nfirst I mean do we believe that Bartholomew Strange was killed in\norder to prevent his revealing the facts of the first murder or his\nsuspicion about it\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Egg and Mr. Satterthwaite again but in unison this time.",
    "\u201cThen it is the first murder we must investigate not the second.\u201d\nEgg nodded.",
    "\u201cIn my mind until we discover the motive for the first murder we\ncan hardly hope to discover the murderer.",
    "The motive presents\nextraordinary difficulty.",
    "Babbington was a harmless pleasant\ngentle old man without one would say an enemy in the world.",
    "Yet\nhe was killed and there must have been some reason for killing.",
    "We\u2019ve got to find that reason.\u201d\n\n\fHe paused and then said in his ordinary everyday voice\n\u201cLet\u2019s get down to it.",
    "What reasons are there for killing people\nFirst I suppose gain.\u201d\n\u201cRevenge\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cHomicidal mania\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cThe crime passionel\nwould hardly apply in this case.",
    "But there\u2019s fear.\u201d\nCharles Cartwright nodded.",
    "He was scribbling on a piece of paper.",
    "\u201cThat about covers the ground\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cFirst Gain.",
    "Does anyone\ngain by Babbington\u2019s death Has he any money or expectation of\nmoney\u201d\n\u201cI should think it very unlikely\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cSo should I but we\u2019d better approach Mrs. Babbington on the\npoint.\u201d\n\u201cThen there\u2019s revenge.",
    "Did Babbington do an injury to anyone\nperhaps in his young days Did he marry the girl that some other\nman wanted We\u2019ll have to look into that too.\u201d\n\u201cThen homicidal mania.",
    "Were both Babbington and Tollie killed by a\nlunatic I don\u2019t think that theory will hold water.",
    "Even a lunatic has\nsome kind of reasonableness in his crimes.",
    "I mean a lunatic might\nthink himself divinely appointed to kill doctors or to kill clergyman\nbut not to kill both.",
    "I think we can wash out the theory of homicidal\nmania.",
    "There remains fear.\u201d\n\u201cNow frankly that seems to me far the most likely solution.",
    "Babbington knew something about somebody or he recognised\n\n\fsomebody.",
    "He was killed to prevent him telling what that something\nwas.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t see what someone like Mr. Babbington could know that was\ndamaging about anybody who was there that night.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Sir Charles \u201cit was something that he didn\u2019t know\nthat he knew.\u201d\nHe went on trying to make his meaning clear.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say just what I mean.",
    "Suppose for instance this is\nonly an instance that Babbington saw a certain person in a certain\nplace at a certain time.",
    "As far as he knows there\u2019s no reason why\nthat person had concocted a very clever alibi for some reason\nshowing that at that particular time he was somewhere else a\nhundred miles away.",
    "Well at any minute old Babbington in the\nmost innocent way in the world might give the show away.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cSay there\u2019s a murder committed in London and\nBabbington sees the man who did it at Paddington Station but the\nman has proved that he didn\u2019t do it by having an alibi showing that\nhe was at Leeds at the time.",
    "Then Babbington might give the whole\nshow away.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean exactly.",
    "Of course that\u2019s only an instance.",
    "It\nmight be anything.",

    "And Mr. Satterthwaite  \u201d her eyes\nshifted to him for a moment \u201c  came and fetched one for a lady Miss Wills I think it was.\u201d\n\u201cQuite right\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cThe others I handed sir I think everyone took one except Sir\nBartholomew.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWill you be so very obliging Temple as to repeat the performance.",
    "Let us put cushions for some of the people.",
    "I stood here I\nremember  Miss Sutcliffe was there.\u201d\nWith Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s help the scene was reconstructed.",
    "Mr.\nSatterthwaite was observant.",
    "He remembered fairly well where\neveryone had been in the room.",
    "Then Temple did her round.",
    "They\nascertained that she had started with Mrs. Dacres gone on to Miss\nSutcliffe and Poirot and had then come to Mr. Babbington Lady\nMary and Mr. Satterthwaite who had been sitting together.",
    "This agreed with Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s recollection.",
    "Finally Temple was dismissed.",
    "\u201cPah\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt does not make sense.",
    "Temple is the last\nperson to handle those cocktails but it was impossible for her to\ntamper with them in any way and as I say one cannot force a\ncocktail on a particular person.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s instinctive to take the one nearest to you\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cPossibly that might work by handing the tray to the person first but then it would be very uncertain.",
    "The glasses are close together\none does not look particularly nearer than another.",
    "No no such a\nhaphazard method could not adopted.",
    "Tell me Mr. Satterthwaite\ndid Mr. Babbington put his cocktail down or did he retain it in his\nhand\u201d\n\u201cHe put it down on this table.\u201d\n\u201cDid anyone come near that table after he had done so\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNo.",
    "I was the nearest person to him and I assure you I did not\ntamper with it in any way  even if I could have done so\nunobserved.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite spoke rather stiffly.",
    "Poirot hastened to apologise.",
    "\u201cNo no I am not making an accusation  quelle id\u00e9e But I want to\nbe very sure of my facts.",
    "According to the analysis there was\nnothing out of the way in that cocktail  now it seems that apart\nfrom that analysis there could have been nothing put in it.",
    "The same\nresults from two different tests.",
    "But Mr. Babbington ate or drank\nnothing else and if he was poisoned by pure nicotine death would\nhave resulted very rapidly.",
    "You see where that leads us\u201d\n\u201cNowhere damn it all\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cI would not say that  no I would not say that.",
    "It suggests a very\nmonstrous idea  which I hope and trust cannot be true.",
    "No of\ncourse it is not true  the death of Sir Bartholomew proves that ...\nAnd yet  \u201d\nHe frowned lost in thought.",
    "The others watched him curiously.",
    "He\nlooked up.",
    "\u201cYou see my point do you not Mrs. Babbington was not at Melfort\nAbbey therefore Mrs. Babbington is cleared of suspicion.\u201d\nPoirot smiled beneficently.",
    "\u201cNo It is a curious thing that.",
    "The idea occurred to me at once  but\nat once.",
    "If the poor gentleman is not poisoned by the cocktail then\nhe must have been poisoned a very few minutes before entering the\nhouse.",
    "What way could there be A capsule Something perhaps\n\n\fto prevent indigestion.",
    "But who then could tamper with that Only\na wife.",
    "Who might perhaps have a motive that no one outside\ncould possibly suspect Again a wife.\u201d\n\u201cBut they were devoted to each other\u201d cried Egg indignantly.",
    "\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t understand a bit.\u201d\nPoirot smiled kindly at her.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "That is valuable.",
    "You know but I do not.",
    "I see the facts\nunbiased by any preconceived notions.",
    "And let me tell you\nsomething mademoiselle  in the course of my experience I have\nknown five cases of wives murdered by devoted husband and\ntwentytwo of husbands murdered by devoted wives.",
    "Les femmes\nthey obviously keep up appearances better.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re perfectly horrid\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cI know the Babbingtons\nare not like that.",
    "It\u2019s  it\u2019s monstrous\u201d\n\u201cMurder is monstrous mademoiselle\u201d said Poirot and there was a\nsudden sternness in his voice.",
    "He went on in a lighter tone.",
    "\u201cBut I  who see only the facts  agree that Mrs. Babbington did not\ndo this thing.",
    "You see she was not at Melfort Abbey.",
    "No as Sir\nCharles had already said the guilt must lie on a person who was\npresent on both occasions  one of the seven on your list.\u201d\nThere was a silence.",
    "\u201cAnd how do you advise us to act\u201d asked Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cYou have doubtless already your plan\u201d suggested Poirot.",
    "Sir Charles cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cThe only feasible thing seems to be a process of elimination\u201d he\nsaid.",
    "\u201cMy idea was to take each person on that list and consider\nthem guilty until they are proved innocent.",
    "I mean that we are to\nfeel convinced ourselves that there is a connection between that\nperson and Stephen Babbington and we are to use ingenuity to find\nout what that connection can be.",
    "If we find no connection then we\npass on to the next person.\u201d\n\u201cIt is good psychology that\u201d approved Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd your method\u201d\n\u201cThat we have not yet had time to discuss.",
    "We should welcome your\nadvice on that point M. Poirot.",
    "Perhaps you yourself  \u201d\nPoirot held up a hand.",
    "\u201cMy friend do not ask me to do anything of an active nature.",
    "It is my\nlifelong conviction that any problem is best solved by thought.",
    "Let\nme hold what is called I believe the watching brief.",
    "Continue your\ninvestigation which Sir Charles is so ably directing  \u201d\n\u201cAnd what about me\u201d thought Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cThese actors\nAlways in the limelight playing the star part\u201d\n\u201cYou will perhaps from time to time require what we may describe\nas Counsel\u2019s opinion.",
    "Me I am the Counsel.\u201d\nHe smiled at Egg.",
    "\u201cDoes that strike you as the sense mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cExcellent\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure your experience will be very useful\nto us.\u201d\n\n\fHer face looked relieved.",
    "She glanced at her watch and gave an\nexclamation.",
    "\u201cI must go home.",
    "Mother will have a fit.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll drive you home\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "They went out together.",
    "17\n\n\u201cSo you see the fish has risen\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite who had been looking at the door which had just\nclosed behind the other two gave a start as he turned to Poirot.",
    "The latter was smiling with a hint of mockery.",
    "\u201cYes yes do not deny it.",
    "Deliberately you showed me the bait that\nday in Monte Carlo.",
    "Is it not so You showed me the paragraph in\nthe paper.",
    "You hoped that it would arouse my interest  that I should\noccupy myself with the affair.\u201d\n\u201cIt is true\u201d confessed Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cBut I thought that I had\nfailed.\u201d\n\u201cNo no you did not fail.",
    "You are a shrewd judge of human nature\nmy friend.",
    "I was suffering from ennui  I had  in the words of the\nchild who was playing near us  \u2018nothing to do.\u2019 You came at the\npsychological moment.",
    "And talking of that how much crime\ndepends too on that psychological moment.",
    "The crime the\npsychology they go hand in hand.",
    "But let us come back to our\nmuttons.",
    "This is\n\n\fa crime very intriguing  it puzzles me completely.\u201d\n\u201cWhich crime  the first or the second\u201d\n\u201cThere is only one  what you call the first and second murder are\nonly the two halves of the same crime.",
    "The second half is simple the motive  the means adopted  \u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite interrupted.",
    "\u201cSurely the means present an equal difficulty.",
    "There was no poison\nfound in any of the wine and the food was eaten by everybody.\u201d\n\u201cNo no it is quite different.",
    "In the first case it does not seem as\nthough anybody could have poisoned Stephen Babbington.",
    "Sir\nCharles if he had wanted to could have poisoned one of his\nguests but not any particular guest.",
    "Temple might possibly have\nslipped something into the last glass on the tray  but Mr.\nBabbington\u2019s was not the last glass.",
    "No the murder of Mr.\nBabbington seems so impossible that I still feel that perhaps it is\nimpossible  that he died a natural death after all ...",
    "But that we shall\nsoon know.",
    "The second case is different.",
    "Any one of the guests\npresent or the butler or parlourmaid could have poisoned\nBartholomew Strange.",
    "That presents no difficulty whatever.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see  \u201d began Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "Poirot went on\n\u201cI will prove that to you some time by a little experiment.",
    "Let us pass\non to another and most important matter.",
    "It is vital you see and\nyou will see I am sure you have the sympathetic heart and the\n\n\fdelicate understanding that I must not play the part of what you\ncall the spoilsport.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean  \u201d began Mr. Satterthwaite with the beginning of a\nsmile.",
    "\u201cThat Sir Charles must have the star part He is used to it.",
    "And\nmoreover it is expected of him by someone else.",
    "Am I not right It\ndoes not please mademoiselle at all that I come to concern myself\nin this matter.\u201d\n\u201cYou are what we call \u2018quick in the uptake\u2019 M. Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cAh that it leaps to the eye I am of a very susceptible nature  I\nwish to assist a love affair  not to hinder it.",
    "You and I my friend\nmust work together in this  to the honour and glory of Charles\nCartwright it is not so When the case is solved  \u201d\n\u201cIf  \u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite mildly.",
    "\u201cWhen I do not permit myself to fail.\u201d\n\u201cNever\u201d asked Mr. Satterthwaite searchingly.",
    "\u201cThere have been times\u201d said Poirot with dignity \u201cwhen for a short\ntime I have been what I suppose you would call slow in the takeup.",
    "I have not perceived the truth as soon as I might have done.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re never failed altogether\u201d\nThe persistence of Mr. Satterthwaite was curiosity pure and\nsimple.",
    "He wondered ...\n\n\f\u201cEh bien\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cOnce.",
    "Long ago in Belgium.",
    "We will not talk\nof it ... \u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite his curiosity and his malice satisfied hastened\nto change the subject.",
    "\u201cJust so.",
    "You were saying that when the case is solved  \u201d\n\u201cSir Charles will have solved it.",
    "That is essential.",
    "I shall have been a\nlittle cog in the wheel he spread out his hands.",
    "Now and then here\nand there I shall say a little word  just one little word  a hint no\nmore.",
    "I desire no honour  no renown.",
    "I have all the renown I need.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite studied him with interest.",
    "He was amused by the\nna\u00efve conceit the immense egoism of the little man.",
    "But he did not\nmake the easy mistake of considering it mere empty boasting.",
    "An\nEnglishman is usually modest about what he does well sometimes\npleased with himself over something he does badly but a Latin has\na truer appreciation of his own powers.",
    "If he is clever he sees no\nreason for concealing the fact.",
    "\u201cI should like to know\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite \u201cit would interest me\nvery much  just what do you yourself hope to get out of this\nbusiness Is it the excitement of the chase\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo  no  it is not that.",
    "Like the chien de chasse I follow the scent\nand I get excited and once on the scent I cannot be called off it.",
    "All\nthat is true.",
    "But there is more ...",
    "It is  how shall I put it  a passion\nfor getting at the truth.",
    "In all the world there is nothing so curious\nand so interesting and so beautiful as truth ... \u201d\n\n\fThere was silence for a little while after Poirot\u2019s words.",
    "Then he took up the paper on which Mr. Satterthwaite had carefully\ncopied out the seven names and read them aloud.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Dacres Captain Dacres Miss Wills Miss Sutcliffe Lady Mary\nLytton Gore Miss Lytton Gore Oliver Manders.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d he said \u201csuggestive is it not\u201d\n\u201cWhat is suggestive about it\u201d\n\u201cThe order in which the names occur.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything suggestive about it.",
    "We just wrote\nthe names down without any particular order about it.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "The list is headed by Mrs. Dacres.",
    "I deduce from that that\nshe is considered the most likely person to have committed the\ncrime.\u201d\n\u201cNot the most likely\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cThe least unlikely\nwould express it better.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a third phrase would express it better still.",
    "She is perhaps the\nperson you would all prefer to have committed the crime.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite opened his lips impulsively then met the gentle\nquizzical gaze of Poirot\u2019s shining green eyes and altered what he\nhad been about to say.",
    "\u201cI wonder  perhaps M. Poirot you are right  unconsciously that\nmay be true.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to ask you something Mr. Satterthwaite.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cCertainly  certainly\u201d Mr. Satterthwaite answered complacently.",
    "\u201cFrom what you have told me I gather that Sir Charles and Miss\nLytton Gore went together to interview Mrs. Babbington.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not accompany them\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "three would have been rather a crowd.\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cAnd also perhaps your inclinations led you elsewhere.",
    "You had\nas they say different fish to fry.",
    "Where did you go Mr.\nSatterthwaite\u201d\n\u201cI had tea with Lady Mary Lytton Gore\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite\nstiffly.",
    "\u201cAnd what did you talk about\u201d\n\u201cShe was so good as to confide in me some of the troubles of her\nearly married life.\u201d\nHe repeated the substances of Lady Mary\u2019s story.",
    "Poirot nodded\nhis head sympathetically.",
    "\u201cThat is so true to life  the idealistic young girl who marries the bad\nhat and will listen to nobody.",
    "But did you talk of nothing else Did\nyou for instance not speak of Mr. Oliver Manders\u201d\n\u201cAs a matter of fact we did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you leant about him  what\u201d\n\n\fMr. Satterthwaite repeated what Lady Mary had told him.",
    "Then he\nsaid\n\u201cWhat made you think we had talked of him\u201d\n\u201cBecause you went there for that reason.",
    "Oh yes do not protest.",
    "You may hope that Mrs. Dacres or her husband committed the\ncrime but you think that young Manders did.\u201d\nHe stilled Mr. Satterthwaite\u2019s protests.",
    "\u201cYes yes you have the secretive nature.",
    "You have your ideas but\nyou like keeping them to yourself.",
    "I have sympathy with you.",
    "I do the\nsame myself ... \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t suspect him  that\u2019s absurd.",
    "But I just want to know more\nabout him.\u201d\n\u201cThat is as I say.",
    "He is your instinctive choice.",
    "I too am interested\nin that young man.",
    "I was interested in him on the night of the dinner\nhere because I saw  \u201d\n\u201cWhat did you see\u201d asked Mr. Satterthwaite eagerly.",
    "\u201cI saw that there were two people at least perhaps more who were\nplaying a part.",
    "One was Sir Charles.\u201d He smiled.",
    "\u201cHe was playing\nthe naval officer am I not right That is quite natural.",
    "A great actor\ndoes not cease to act because he is not on the stage any more.",
    "But\nyoung Manders he too was acting.",
    "He was playing the part of the\nbored and blas\u00e9 young man  but in reality he was neither bored nor\nblas\u00e9  he was very keenly alive.",
    "And therefore my friend I noticed\nhim.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know I\u2019d been wondering about him\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIn many little ways.",
    "You have been interested in that accident of\nhis that brought him to Melfort Abbey that night.",
    "You had not gone\nwith Sir Charles and Miss Lytton Gore to see Mrs. Babbington.",
    "Why Because you wanted to follow out some line of your own\nunobserved.",
    "You went to Lady Mary\u2019s to find out about someone.",
    "Who It could only be someone local.",
    "Oliver Manders.",
    "And then\nmost characteristic you put his name at the bottom of the list.",
    "Who\nare really the least likely suspects in you mind  Lady Mary and\nMademoiselle Egg  but you put his name after theirs because he is\nyour dark horse and you want to keep him to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cDear me\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cAm I really that kind of man\u201d\n\u201cPr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment.",
    "You have shrewd judgment and observation and you\nlike keeping its results to yourself.",
    "Your opinions of people are your\nprivate collection.",
    "You do not display them for all the world to see.\u201d\n\u201cI believe\u201d began Mr. Satterthwaite but he was interrupted by the\nreturn of Sir Charles.",
    "The actor came in with a springing buoyant step.",
    "\u201cBrrr\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a wild night.\u201d\nHe poured himself out a whisky and soda.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite and Poirot both declined.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Sir Charles \u201clet\u2019s map out our plan of campaign.",
    "Where\u2019s that list Satterthwaite An thanks.",
    "Now M. Poirot\ncounsel\u2019s opinion if you please.",
    "How shall we divide up the\nspadework\u201d\n\u201cHow would you suggest yourself Sir Charles\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell we might divide these people up  division of labour  eh\nFirst there\u2019s Mrs. Dacres.",
    "Egg seems rather keen to take her on.",
    "She seems to think that anyone so perfectly turned out won\u2019t get\nimpartial treatment from mere males.",
    "It seems quite a good idea to\napproach her through the professional side.",
    "Satterthwaite and I\nmight work the other gambit as well if it seemed advisable.",
    "Then\nthere\u2019s Dacres.",
    "I know some of his racing pals.",
    "I daresay I could\npick up something that way.",
    "Then there\u2019s Angela Sutcliffe.\u201d\n\u201cThat also seems to be your work Cartwright\u201d said Mr.\nSatterthwaite.",
    "\u201cYou know her pretty well don\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "That\u2019s why I\u2019d rather somebody else tackled her ... Firstly\u201d he\nsmiled ruefully \u201cI shall be accused of not putting my back into the\njob and secondly  well  she\u2019s a friend  you understand\u201d\n\u201cParfaitement parfaitement  you feel the natural delicacy.",
    "It is\nmost understandable.",
    "This good Mr. Satterthwaite  he will replace\nyou in the task.\u201d\n\u201cLady Mary and Egg  they don\u2019t count of course.",
    "What about\nyoung Manders His presence on the night of Tollie\u2019s death was an\naccident still I suppose we ought to include him.\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Satterthwaite will look after young Manders said Poirot.",
    "But I\nthink Sir Charles you have missed out a name on your list.",
    "You\nhave passed over Miss Muriel Wills.\u201d\n\u201cSo I have.",
    "Well if Satterthwaite takes on Manders I\u2019ll take on Miss\nWills.",
    "Is that settled Any suggestions M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cNo no  I do not think so.",
    "I shall be interested to hear your results.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOf course  that goes without saying.",
    "Another idea If we procured\nphotographs of these people we might use them in making inquiries\nin Gilling.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent\u201d approved Poirot.",
    "\u201cThere was something  ah yes your\nfriend Sir Bartholomew he did not drink cocktails but he did drink\nthe port\u201d\n\u201cYes he had a particular weakness for port.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems odd to me that he did not taste anything unusual.",
    "Pure\nnicotine has a most pungent and unpleasant taste.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember\u201d said Sir Charles \u201cthat there probably\nwasn\u2019t any nicotine in the port.",
    "The contents of the glass were\nanalysed remember.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes  foolish of me.",
    "But however it was administered  nicotine\nhas a very disagreeable taste.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that that would matter\u201d said Sir Charles slowly.",
    "\u201cTollie had a very bad go of influenza last spring and it left him with\nhis sense of taste and smell a good deal impaired.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThat might account for it.",
    "That\nsimplifies things considerably.\u201d\nSir Charles went to the window and looked out.",
    "\u201cStill blowing a gale.",
    "I\u2019ll send for your things M. Poirot.",
    "The Rose\nand Crown is all very well for enthusiastic artists but I think you\u2019d\nprefer proper sanitation and a comfortable bed.\u201d\n\u201cYou are extremely amiable Sir Charles.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNot at all.",
    "I\u2019ll see to it now.\u201d\nHe left the room.",
    "Poirot looked at Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cIf I may permit myself a suggestion.\u201d\nPoirot leaned forward and said in a low voice\n\u201cAsk young Manders why he faked an accident.",
    "Tell him the police\nsuspect him  and see what he says.\u201d\n\n18\n\nThe showrooms of Ambrosine Ltd. were very pure in appearance.",
    "The walls were a shade just off white  the thick pile carpet was son\nneutral as to be almost colourless  so was the upholstery.",
    "Chromium gleamed here and there and on one wall was a gigantic\ngeometric design in vivid blue and lemon yellow.",
    "The room had\nbeen designed by Mr. Sydney Sandford  the newest and youngest\ndecorator of the moment.",
    "Egg Lytton Gore sat in an armchair of modern design  faintly\nreminiscent of a dentist\u2019s chair and watched exquisite snakelike\nyoung women with beautiful bored faces pass sinuously before her.",
    "Egg was principally concerned with endeavouring to appear as\nthough fifty or sixty pounds was a mere bagatelle to pay for a dress.",

    "The experiment could only be fair this way.\u201d\n\u201cWas that the only reason you planned this  to see whether it could\nbe done unnoticed\u201d\n\u201cWell not quite perhaps.",

    "It was a lovely crisp morning with just a touch of frost in the air.",

    "At last however they were flying smoothly along the Folkestone\nroad.",
    "After passing through Maidstone Sir Charles consulted a\nmap and they turned off from the main road and were shortly\nwinding through country lanes.",
    "It was about a quarter to twelve\nwhen they at last reached their objective.",
    "Gilling was a village which the world had left behind.",
    "It had an old\nchurch a vicarage two or three shops a row of cottages three or\nfour new council houses and a very attractive village green.",
    "Miss Milray\u2019s mother lived in a tiny house on the other side of the\ngreen to the church.",

    "She\u2019s so\nmuch more efficient than I am  she\u2019d probably try to prompt me.\u201d\nEgg laughed.",
    "Mrs. Milray turned out to be almost ludicrously unlike her daughter.",
    "Where Miss Milray was hard she was soft where Miss Milray was\nangular she was round.",
    "Mrs. Milray was an immense dumpling of a\nwoman immovably fixed in an armchair conveniently placed so that\nshe could from the window observe all that went on in the world\noutside.",
    "She seemed pleasurably excited by the arrival of her visitors.",
    "\u201cThis is very nice of you I\u2019m sure Sir Charles.",

    "Perhaps you\u2019d like a little refreshment after your drive\ndown\u201d\nBoth Sir Charles and Egg disclaimed the need of refreshment but\nMrs. Milray paid no attention.",
    "She clapped her hands in an Oriental\nmanner and tea and biscuits made their appearance.",
    "As they\nnibbled and sipped Sir Charles came to the object of their visit.",
    "\u201cI expect you\u2019ve heard Mrs. Milray all about the tragic death of Mr.\nBabbington who used to be vicar here\u201d\nThe dumpling nodded its head in vigorous assent.",
    "\u201cYes indeed.",
    "I\u2019ve read all about the exhumation in the paper.",
    "And\nwhoever can have poisoned him I can\u2019t imagine.",
    "A very nice man\n\n\fhe was everyone liked him here  and her too.",
    "And their little\nchildren and all.\u201d\n\u201cIt is indeed a great mystery\u201d said Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re all in despair\nabout it.",
    "In fact we wondered if you could possibly throw any light\nupon the matter.\u201d\n\u201cMe But I haven\u2019t seen the Babbingtons  let me see  it must be\nover fifteen years.\u201d\n\u201cI know but some of us have the idea that there might be something\nin the past to account for his death.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what there could be.",
    "They led very quiet lives\n very badly off poor things with all those children.\u201d\nMrs. Milray was willing enough to reminisce but her reminiscences\nseemed to shed little light on the problem they had set out to solve.",
    "Sir Charles showed her the enlargement of a snapshot which\nincluded the Dacres also an early portrait of Angela Sutcliffe and a\nsomewhat blurred reproduction of Miss Wills cut from a newspaper.",
    "Mrs. Milray surveyed them all with great interest but with no signs\nof recognition.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t say I remember any of them  of course it\u2019s a long time ago.",
    "But this is a small place.",
    "There\u2019s not much coming and going.",
    "The\nAgnew girls the doctor\u2019s daughters  they\u2019re all married and out in\nthe world and our present doctor\u2019s a bachelor  he\u2019s got a new\nyoung partner.",
    "Then there were the old Miss Cayleys  sat in the big\npew  they\u2019re all dead many years back.",
    "And the Richardsons  he\ndied and she went to Wales.",
    "And the village people of course.",
    "But\nthere\u2019s not much change there.",
    "Violet I expect could tell you as\n\n\fmuch as I could.",
    "She was a young girl hen and often over at the\nVicarage.\u201d\nSir Charles tried to envisage Miss Milray as a young girl and failed.",
    "He asked Mrs. Milray if she remembered anyone of the name of\nRushbridger but the name failed to evoke any response.",
    "Finally they took their leave.",
    "Their next move was a scratch lunch in the baker\u2019s shop.",
    "Sir\nCharles had hankerings for fleshpots elsewhere but Egg pointed\nout that they might get hold of some local gossip.",
    "\u201cAnd boiled eggs and scones will do you no harm for once\u201d she\nsaid severely.",
    "\u201cMen are so fussy about their food.\u201d\n\u201cI always find eggs so depressing\u201d said Sir Charles meekly.",
    "The woman who served them was communicative enough.",
    "She too\nhad read of the exhumation in the paper and had been\nproportionately thrilled by its being \u201cold vicar.\u201d \u201cI were a child at\nthe time\u201d she explained.",
    "\u201cBut I remember him.\u201d\nShe could not however tell them much about him.",
    "After lunch they went to the church and looked through the register\nof births marriages and deaths.",
    "Here again there seemed nothing\nhopeful or suggestive.",
    "They came out into the churchyard and lingered.",
    "Egg read the\nnames on the tombstones.",
    "\u201cWhat queer names there are\u201d she said.",

    "When  when  you thought I was dead.\u201d\n\u201cOh then.\u201d Egg tried to make her voice nonchalant.",

    "Mrs. de Rushbridger had\nnever mentioned Sir Bartholomew\u2019s death and they did not even\nknow of the despatching of the telegram.",
    "On a request from Poirot the two men were taken to the dead\nwoman\u2019s room.",
    "They found Superintendent Crossfield in charge\nand Mr. Satterthwaite introduced him to Poirot.",
    "Then the two men moved over to the bed and stood looking down\non the dead woman.",
    "She was about forty darkhaired and pale.",
    "Her\nface was not peaceful  it still showed the agony of her death.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite said slowly\n\n\f\u201cPoor soul ... \u201d\nHe looked across at Hercule Poirot.",
    "There was a strange\nexpression on the little Belgian\u2019s face.",
    "Something about it made Mr. Satterthwaite shiver ...\nMr. Satterthwaite said\n\u201cSomeone knew she was going to speak and killed her ... She was\nkilled in order to prevent her speaking ... \u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYes that is so.\u201d\n\u201cShe was murdered to prevent her telling us what she knew.\u201d\n\u201cOr what she did not know ...",
    "But let us not waste time ...",
    "There is\nmuch to be done.",
    "There must be no more deaths.",
    "We must see to\nthat.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite asked curiously\n\u201cDoes this fit in with your idea of the murderer\u2019s identity\u201d\n\u201cYes it fits ...",
    "But I realise one thing The murderer is more\ndangerous than I thought ... We must be careful.\u201d\nSuperintendent Crossfield followed them out of the room and learnt\nfrom them of the telegram which had been received by them.",
    "The\ntelegram had been handed it at Melfort Post Office and on inquiry\nthere it was elicited that it had been handed in by a small boy.",
    "The\nyoung lady in charge remembered it because the message had\n\n\fexcited her very much mentioning as it did Sir Bartholomew\nStrange\u2019s death.",
    "After six o\u2019clock that evening the small boy who had handed in the\ntelegram was found.",
    "He told his story promptly.",
    "He had been given\nthe telegram by a man dressed in shabby clothes.",
    "The man told him\nthat the telegram had been given him by a \u201cloony lady\u201d in the\n\u201cHouse in the Park.\u201d She had dropped it out of the window wrapped\nround two halfcrowns.",
    "The man was afraid to be mixed up in some\nfunny business and was tramping in the other direction so he had\ngiven the boy two and six and told him to keep the change.",
    "A search would be instituted for the man.",
    "In the meantime there\nseemed nothing more to be done and Poirot and Mr. Satterthwaite\nreturned to London.",
    "It was close on midnight when the two men arrived back in town.",
    "Egg had gone back to her mother but Sir Charles met them and\nthe three men discussed the situation.",
    "\u201cMon ami\u201d said Poirot \u201cbe guided by me.",
    "Only one thing will solve\nthis case  the little grey cells of the brain.",
    "To rush up and down\nEngland to hope that this person and that will tell us what we want\nto know  all such methods are amateurish and absurd.",
    "The truth\ncan only be seen from within.\u201d\nSir Charles looked slightly sceptical.",
    "\u201cWhat do you want to do then\u201d\n\u201cI want to think.",
    "I ask of you twentyfour house  in which to think.\u201d\nSir Charles shook his head with a slight smile.",
    "\u201cWill thinking tell you what it was this woman could have said if she\nlived\u201d\n\u201cI believe so.\u201d\n\u201cIt hardly seems possible.",
    "However M. Poirot you must have it\nyour own way.",
    "If you can see through this mystery it\u2019s more than I\ncan.",
    "I\u2019m beaten and I confess it.",
    "In any case I\u2019ve other fish to fry.\u201d\nPerhaps he hoped to be questioned but if so his expectation was\ndisappointed.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite did indeed look up alertly but\nPoirot remained lost in thought.",
    "\u201cWell I must be off\u201d said the actor.",
    "\u201cOh just one thing.",
    "I\u2019m rather\nworried about  Miss Wills.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about her\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d\nPoirot stared at him.",
    "\u201cGone Gone where\u201d\n\u201cNobody knows...",
    "I was thinking things over after I got your\ntelegram.",
    "As I told you at the time I felt convinced that that woman\nknew something she hadn\u2019t told us.",
    "I thought I\u2019d have a last shot at\ngetting it out of her.",
    "I drove out to her house  it was about halfpast\nnine when I got there  and asked for her.",
    "It appears she left home\nthis morning  went up to London for the day  that\u2019s what she said.",
    "Her people got a telegram in the evening saying she wasn\u2019t\nreturning for a day or so and not to worry.\u201d\n\u201cAnd were they worrying\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI gather they were rather.",
    "You see she hadn\u2019t taken any luggage\nwith her.\u201d\n\u201cOdd\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cI know.",
    "It seems as though  I don\u2019t know.",
    "I feel uneasy.\u201d\n\u201cI warned her\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI warned everyone.",
    "You remember I\nsaid to them \u2018Speak now.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYes yes.",
    "Do you think that she too  \u201d\n\u201cI have my ideas\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cFor the moment I prefer not to\ndiscuss them.\u201d\n\u201cFist the butler  Ellis  then Miss Wills.",
    "Where is Ellis It\u2019s\nincredible that the police have never been able to lay hands on\nhim.\u201d\n\u201cThey have not looked for his body in the right place\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThen you agree with Egg.",
    "You think he is dead\u201d\n\u201cEllis will never be seen alive again.\u201d\n\u201cMy God\u201d burst out Sir Charles.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare  the whole thing\nis utterly incomprehensible.\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "It is sane and logical on the contrary.\u201d\nSir Charles stared at him.",
    "\u201cYou say that\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "You see I have the orderly mind.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite too looked curiously at the little detective.",
    "\u201cWhat kind of mind have I\u201d demanded Sir Charles slightly hurt.",
    "\u201cYou have the actor\u2019s mind Sir Charles creative original seeing\nalways dramatic values.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite he has the playgoer\u2019s\nmind he observes the characters he has the sense of atmosphere.",
    "But me I have the prosaic mind.",
    "I see only the facts without any\ndramatic trappings or footlights.\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019re to leave you to it\u201d\n\u201cThat is my idea.",
    "For twentyfour hours.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck to you then.",
    "Goodnight.\u201d\nAs they went away together Sir Charles said to Mr. Satterthwaite\n\u201cThat chap thinks a lot of himself.\u201d\nHe spoke rather coldly.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite smiled.",
    "That star part So that was it.",
    "He said\n\u201cWhat did you mean by saying you had other fish to fry Sir\nCharles\u201d\nOn Sir Charles\u2019s face appeared the sheepish expression that Mr.\nSatterthwaite knew so well from attending weddings in Hanover\nSquare.",
    "\u201cWell as a matter of fact I  er  well Egg and I  \u201d\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019m delighted to hear it\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "\u201cMy best\ncongratulations.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m years too old for her.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t think so  and she\u2019s the best judge.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you Satterthwaite.",
    "You know I\u2019d got it into my\nhead she was fond of young Manders.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what made you think that\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite\ninnocently.",
    "\u201cAnyway\u201d said Sir Charles firmly \u201cshe isn\u2019t ... \u201d\n\n26\n\nPoirot did not have quite the uninterrupted twentyfour hours for\nwhich he had stipulated.",
    "At twenty minutes past eleven on the following morning Egg walked\nin unannounced.",
    "To her amazement she found the great detective\nengaged in building card houses.",
    "Her face showed such lively\nscorn that Poirot was impelled to defend himself.",
    "\u201cIt is not mademoiselle that I have become childish in my old age.",
    "No.",
    "But the building of card houses I have always found it most\nstimulating to the mind.",
    "It is an old habit of mine.",
    "This morning first\nthing I go out and buy the pack of cards.",
    "Unfortunately I make an\nerror they are not real cards.",
    "But they do just as well.\u201d\nEgg looked more closely at the erection on the table.",
    "She laughed.",
    "\u201cGood heavens they\u2019ve sold you Happy Families.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that you say the Happy Families\u201d\n\u201cYes it\u2019s a game.",
    "Children play it in the nursery.\u201d\n\u201cAh well one can compose the houses just in the same manner.\u201d\nEgg had picked up some of the cards from the table and was\nlooking at them affectionately.",
    "\u201cMaster Bun the baker\u2019s son  I always loved him.",

    "When she had finished he said\n\u201cAh it was that that Sir Charles meant last night.",
    "I wondered ...\nMugg  ah yes one says in slang does one not you are a mug  a\nfool Naturally you would change your name.",
    "You would not like to\nbe Lady Mugg eh\u201d\nEgg laughed.",
    "She said\n\u201cWell wish me happiness.\u201d\n\u201cI do wish you happiness mademoiselle.",
    "Not the brief happiness of\nyouth but the happiness that endures  the happiness that is built\nupon a rock.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019ll tell Charles you call him a rock\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cAnd now for what I\ncame to see you about.",
    "I\u2019ve been worrying and worrying about that\ncutting from the paper that Oliver dropped from his wallet.",
    "You\nknow the one Miss Wills picked up and handed back to him.",
    "It\nseems to me that either Oliver is telling a downright lie when he\nsays he doesn\u2019t remember its being there or else it never was\nthere.",
    "He dropped some odd bit of paper and that woman\npretended it was the nicotine cutting.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should she have done that mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cBecause she wanted to get rid of it.",
    "She planted it one Oliver.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean she is a criminal\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was her motive\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good asking me that.",
    "I can only suggest that she\u2019s a lunatic.",
    "Clever people often are rather mad.",
    "I can\u2019t see any other reason  in\nfact I can\u2019t see any motive anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cDecidedly that is the impasse.",
    "I should not ask you to guess at a\nmotive.",
    "It is of myself that I ask that question without ceasing.",
    "What\nwas the motive behind Mr. Babbington\u2019s death When I can answer\nthat the case will be solved.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think just madness  \u201d suggested Egg.",
    "\u201cNo mademoiselle  not madness in the sense you mean.",
    "There is a\nreason.",
    "I must find that reason.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell goodbye\u201d said Egg.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have disturbed you but\nthe idea just occurred to me.",
    "I must hurry.",
    "I\u2019m going with Charles to\nthe dress rehearsal of Little Dog Laughed  you know the play Miss\nWills has written for Angela Sutcliffe.",
    "It\u2019s the first night tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cMon dieu\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat is it Has anything happened\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed something has happened.",
    "An idea.",
    "A superb idea.",
    "Oh\nbut I have been blind  blind  \u201d\nEgg stared at him.",
    "As though realising his eccentricity Poirot took\na hold on himself.",
    "He patted Egg on the shoulder.",
    "\u201cYou think I am mad.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I heard what you said.",
    "You go to see\nThe Little Dog Laughed and Miss Sutcliffe acts in it.",
    "Go then and\npay no attention to what I have said.\u201d\nRather doubtfully Egg departed.",
    "Left to himself Poirot strode up\nand down the room muttering under his breath.",
    "His eyes hone\ngreen as any cat\u2019s.",
    "\u201cMais oui  that explains everything.",
    "A curious motive  a very\ncurious motive  such a motive as I have never come across before\nand yet it is reasonable and given the circumstances natural.",
    "Altogether a very curious case.\u201d\nHe passed the table where his card house still reposed.",
    "With a\nsweep of his hands he swept the cards from the table.",
    "\u201cThe happy family I need it no longer\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe problem is\nsolved.",
    "It only remains to act.\u201d\n\n\fHe caught up his had and put on his overcoat.",
    "Then he went\ndownstairs and the commissionaire called him a taxi.",
    "Poirot gave\nthe address of Sir Charles\u2019s flat.",
    "Arrived there he paid off the taxi and stepped into the hall.",
    "The\nporter was absent taking up the lift.",
    "Poirot walked up the stairs.",
    "Just as he arrived on the second floor the door of Sir Charles\u2019s flat\nopened and Miss Milray came out.",
    "She started when she saw Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cMe Or is it I Enfin moi\u201d\nMiss Milray said\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t find Sir Charles.",
    "He\u2019s gone to the Babylon\nTheatre with Miss Lytton Gore.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not Sir Charles I seek.",
    "It is my stick that I think I have left\nbehind one day.\u201d\n\u201cOh I see.",
    "Well if you\u2019ll ring Temple will find it for you.",
    "I\u2019m sorry I\ncan\u2019t stop.",
    "I\u2019m on my way to catch a train.",
    "I\u2019m going down to Kent to my mother.\u201d\n\u201cI comprehend.",
    "Do not let me delay you mademoiselle.\u201d\nHe stood aside and Miss Milray passed rapidly down the stairs.",
    "She\nwas carrying a small attach\u00e9 case.",
    "But when she had gone Poirot seemed to forget the purpose for\nwhich he had come.",
    "Instead of going on up to the landing he turned\nand made his way downstairs again.",
    "He arrived at the front door\njust in time to see Miss Milray getting into a taxi.",
    "Another taxi was\ncoming slowly along the kerb.",
    "Poirot raised a hand and it came to\nrest.",
    "He got in and directed the driver to follow the other taxi.",
    "No surprise showed on his face when the first taxi went north and\nfinally drew up at Paddington Station though Paddington is an odd\nstation from which to proceed to Kent.",
    "Poirot went to the firstclass\nbooking window and demanded a return ticket to Loomouth.",
    "The\ntrain was due to depart in five minutes.",
    "Pulling up his overcoat well\nabout his ears for the day was cold Poirot ensconced himself in\nthe corner of a firstclass carriage.",
    "They arrived at Loomouth about five o\u2019clock.",
    "It was already\ngrowing dark.",
    "Standing back a little Poirot heard Miss Milray being\ngreeted by the friendly porter at the little station.",
    "\u201cWell now miss we didn\u2019t expect you.",
    "Is Sir Charles coming\ndown\u201d\nMiss Milray replied\n\u201cI\u2019ve come down here unexpectedly.",
    "I shall be going back tomorrow\nmorning.",
    "I\u2019ve just come to fetch some things.",
    "No I don\u2019t want a cab\nthank you.",
    "I\u2019ll walk up by the cliff path.\u201d\nThe dusk had deepened.",
    "Miss Milray walked briskly up the steep\nzigzag path.",
    "A good way behind came Hercule Poirot.",
    "He trod softly\nlike a cat.",
    "Miss Milray on arrival at Crows Nest produced a key\nfrom her bag and passed through the side door leaving it ajar.",
    "She\n\n\freappeared a minute or two later.",
    "She had a rusty door key and an\nelectric torch in her hand.",
    "Poirot drew back a little behind a\nconvenient bush.",
    "Miss Milray passed round behind the house and up a scrambling\novergrown path.",
    "Hercule Poirot followed.",
    "Up and up went Miss\nMilray until she came suddenly to an old stone tower such as is\nfound often on that coast.",
    "This one was of humble and dilapidated\nappearance.",
    "There was however a curtain over the dirty window\nand Miss Milray inserted her key in the big wooden door.",
    "The key turned with a protesting creak.",
    "The door swung with a\ngroan on its hinges.",
    "Miss Milray and her torch passed inside.",
    "With an increase of pace Poirot caught up.",
    "He passed in his turn\nnoiselessly through the door.",
    "The light of Miss Milray\u2019s torch\ngleamed fitfully on glass retorts a bunsen burner  various\napparatus.",
    "Miss Milray had picked up a cowbar.",
    "She had raised it and was\nholding it over the glass apparatus when a hand caught her by the\narm.",
    "She gasped and turned.",
    "The green catlike eyes of Poirot looked into hers.",
    "\u201cYou cannot do that mademoiselle\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cFor what you seek to\ndestroy is evidence.\u201d\n\n27\n\n\fHercule Poirot sat in a big armchair.",
    "The wall lights had been\nturned out.",
    "Only a roseshaded lamp shed its glow on the figure in\nthe armchair.",
    "There seemed something symbolic about it  he alone\nin the light  and the other three Sir Charles Mr. Satterthwaite and\nEgg Lytton Gore  Poirot\u2019s audience  sitting in the outer darkness.",
    "Hercule Poirot\u2019s voice was dreamy.",
    "He seemed to be addressing\nhimself to space rather than his listeners.",
    "\u201cTo reconstruct the crime  that is the aim of the detective.",
    "To\nreconstruct a crime you must place one fact upon another just as\nyou place one card on another in building a house of cards.",
    "And if\nthe facts will not fit  if the card will not balance  well  you must\nstart your house again or else it will fall ...\n\u201cAs I said the other day there are three different types of mind\nThere is the dramatic mind  the producer\u2019s mind which sees the\neffect of reality that can be produced by mechanical appliances there is also the mind that reacts easily to dramatic appearances and there is the young romantic mind  and finally my friends there\nis the prosaic mind  the mind that sees not blue sea and mimosa\ntree but the painted backcloth of stage scenery.",
    "\u201cSo I come mes amis to the murder of Stephen Babbington in\nAugust last.",
    "On that evening Sir Charles Cartwright advanced the\ntheory that Stephen Babbington had been murdered.",
    "I did not\nagree with that theory.",
    "I could not believe a that such a man as\nStephen Babbington was likely to have been murdered and b that\nit was possible to administer poison to a particular person under\nthe circumstances that had obtained that evening.",
    "\u201cNow here I admit that Sir Charles was right and I was wrong.",
    "I was\nwrong because I was looking at the crime from an entirely false\nangle.",
    "It is only twentyfour hours ago that I suddenly perceived the\nproper angle of vision  and let me say that from that angle of vision\nthe murder of Stephen Babbington is both reasonable and possible.",
    "But I will pass from that point for the moment and take you step by\nstep along the path I myself have trodden.",
    "The death of Stephen\nBabbington I may call the first act of our drama.",
    "The curtain fell on\nthat act when we all departed from Crow\u2019s Nest.",
    "\u201cWhat I might call the second act of the drama began in Monte\nCarlo when Mr. Satterthwaite showed me the newspaper account\nof Sir Bartholomew\u2019s death.",
    "It was at once clear that I had been\nwrong and Sir Charles had been right.",
    "Both Stephen Babbington\nand Sir Bartholomew Strange had been murdered and the two\nmurders formed part of one and the same crime.",
    "Later a third\nmurder completed the series  the murder of Mrs. de Rushbridger.",
    "What we need therefore is a reasonable commonsense theory\nwhich will link those three deaths together  in other words those\nthree crimes were committed by one and the same person and\nwere to the advantage and benefit of that particular person.",
    "\u201cNow I may say at once that the principal thing that worried me was\nthe fact that the murder of Sir Bartholomew Strange came after that\nof Stephen Babbington.",
    "Looking at those three murders without\ndistinction of time and place the probabilities pointed to the murder\nof Sir Bartholomew Strange being what one might call the central\nor principal crime and the other two murders as secondary in\ncharacter  that is arising from the connection of those two people\nwith Sir Bartholomew Strange.",
    "However as I remarked before  one\n\n\fcannot have one\u2019s crime as one would like to have it.",
    "Stephen\nBabbington had been murdered first and Sir Bartholomew Strange\nsome time later.",
    "It seemed therefore as though the second crime\nmust necessarily arise out of the first and that accordingly it was\nthe first crime we must examine for the clue to the whole.",
    "\u201cI did indeed so fair incline to the theory of probability that I\nseriously considered the idea of a mistake having arisen.",
    "Was it\npossible that Sir Bartholomew Strange was intended as the first\nvictim and that Mr. Babbington was poisoned by mistake I was\nforced however to abandon that idea.",
    "Anybody who knew Sir\nBartholomew Strange with any degree of intimacy knew that he\ndisliked the cocktail habit.",
    "\u201cAnother suggestion Had Stephen Babbington been poisoned in\nmistake for any other member of the original party I could not find\nany evidence of such a thing.",
    "I was therefore forced back to the\nconclusion that the murder of Stephen Babbington had been\ndefinitely intended  and at once I came up against a complete\nstumbling block  the apparent impossibility of such a thing having\nhappened.",
    "\u201cOne should always start an investigation with the simplest and\nmost obvious theories.",
    "Granting that Stephen Babbington had\ndrunk a poisoned cocktail who had had the opportunity of\npoisoning that cocktail At first sight it seemed to that the only two\npeople who could have done so e.g.",
    "who handled the drinks were\nSir Charles Cartwright himself and the parlourmaid Temple.",
    "But\nthough either of them could presumably have introduced the poison\ninto the glass neither of them had had any opportunity of directing\nthat particular glass into Mr. Babbington\u2019s hand.",
    "Temple might\n\n\fhave done so by adroit handing of the tray so as to offer him the one\nremaining glass  not easy but it might have been done.",
    "Sir\nCharles could have done so by deliberately picking up the\nparticular glass and handing it to him.",
    "But neither of these things\nhad occurred.",
    "It looked as though chance and chance alone\ndirected that particular glass to Stephen Babbington.",
    "\u201cSir Charles Cartwright and Temple had the handling of the\ncocktails.",
    "Were either of those two at Melfort Abbey They were\nnot.",
    "Who had the best chance of tampering with Sir Bartholomew\u2019s\nport glass The absconding butler Ellis and his helper the\nparlourmaid.",
    "But here however the possibility that one of the\nguests had done so could not be laid aside.",
    "It was risky but it was\npossible for any of the house party to have slipped into the dining\nroom and put the nicotine into the port glass.",
    "\u201cWhen I joined you at Crow\u2019s Nest you already had a list drawn up\nof the people who had been at Crows Nest and at Melfort Abbey.",
    "I\nmay say now that the four names which headed the list  Captain\nand Mrs. Dacres Miss Sutcliffe and Miss Wills  I discarded\nimmediately.",
    "\u201cIt was impossible that any of those four people should have known\nbeforehand that they were going to meet Stephen Babbington at\ndinner.",
    "The employment of nicotine as a poison showed a carefully\nthoughtout plan not one that could be put into operation on the\nspur of the moment.",
    "There were three other names on that list Lady Mary Lytton Gore Miss Lytton Gore and Mr. Oliver Manders.",
    "Although not probable those three were possible.",
    "They were local\npeople they might conceivably have motives for the removal of\n\n\fStephen Babbington and have chosen the evening of the dinnerparty for putting their plans into operation.",
    "\u201cOn the other hand I could find no evidence whatsoever that any of\nthem had actually done such a thing.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Satterthwaite I think reasoned on much the same lines as I\nhad done and he fixed his suspicion on Oliver Manders.",
    "I may say\nthat young Manders was by far the most possible suspect.",
    "He\ndisplayed all the signs of high nervous tension on that evening at\nCrow\u2019s Nest  he had a somewhat distorted view of life owing to his\nprivate troubles  he had a strong inferiority complex which is a\nfrequent cause of crime he was at an unbalanced age he had\nactually had a quarrel or shall we say had displayed animosity\nagainst\n\nMr.\n\nBabbington.",
    "Then\n\nthere\n\nwere\n\nthe\n\ncurious\n\ncircumstances of his arrival at Melfort Abbey.",
    "And later we had his\nsomewhat incredible story of the letter from Sir Bartholomew\nStrange and the evidence of Miss Wills as to his having a\nnewspaper cutting on the subject of nicotine poisoning in his\npossession.",
    "\u201cOliver Manders then was clearly the person who should be\nplaced at the head of the list of those seven suspects.",
    "\u201cBut then my friends I was visited by a curious sensation.",
    "It\nseemed clear and logical enough that the person who had\ncommitted the crimes must have been a person who had been\npresent on both occasions in other words a person on that list of\nseven  but I had the feeling that that obviousness was an arranged\nobviousness.",
    "It was what any sane and logical person would be\nexpected to think.",
    "I felt that I was in fact looking not at reality but\nat an artfully painted bit of scenery.",
    "A really clever criminal would\n\n\fhave realised that anyone whose name was on that list would\nnecessarily be suspect and therefore he or she would arrange for\nit not to be there.",
    "\u201cIn other words the murderer of Stephen Babbington and Sir\nBartholomew Strange was present on both occasions  but was not\napparently so.",
    "\u201cWho had been present on the first occasion and not on the\nsecond Sir Charles Cartwright Mr. Satterthwaite Miss Milray and\nMrs. Babbington.",
    "\u201cCould any of those four have been present on the second occasion\nin some capacity other than their own Sir Charles and Mr.\nSatterthwaite had been in the South of France Miss Milray had\nbeen in London Mrs. Babbington had been in Loomouth.",
    "Of the\nfour then Miss Milray and Mrs. Babbington seemed indicated.",
    "But\ncould Miss Milray have been present at Melfort Abbey unrecognised\nby any of the company Miss Milray has very striking features not\neasily disguised and not easily forgotten.",
    "I decided that it was\nimpossible that Miss Milray could have been at Melfort Abbey\nunrecognised.",
    "The same applied to Mrs. Babbington.",
    "\u201cFor the matter of that could Mr. Satterthwaite or Sir Charles\nCartwright have been at Melfort Abbey and not been recognised\nMr. Satterthwaite just possibly but when we come to Sir Charles\nCartwright we come to a very different matter.",
    "Sir Charles is an\nactor accustomed to playing a part.",
    "But what part could he have\nplayed\n\u201cAnd then I came to the consideration of the butler Ellis.",
    "\u201cA very mysterious person Ellis.",
    "A person who appears from\nnowhere a fortnight before the crime and vanishes afterwards with\ncomplete success.",
    "Why was Ellis so successful Because Ellis did\nnot really exist.",
    "Ellis again was a thing of pasteboard and paint\nand stagecraft  Ellis was not real.",
    "\u201cBut was it possible After all the servants at Melfort Abbey knew\nSir Charles Cartwright and Sir Bartholomew Strange was an\nintimate friend of his.",
    "The servants I got over easily enough.",
    "The\nimpersonation of the butler risked nothing  if the servants\nrecognised him  why no harm would be done  the whole thing\ncould be passed off as a joke.",
    "If on the other hand a fortnight\npassed without any suspicion being aroused well the thing was\nsafe as houses.",
    "And I recalled what I had been told of the servants\u2019\nremarks about the butler.",
    "He was \u2018quite the gentleman\u2019 and had\nbeen \u2018in good houses\u2019 and knew several interesting scandals.",
    "That\nwas easy enough.",
    "But a very significant statement was made by the\nparlourmaid Alice.",
    "She said \u2018He arranged the work different from\nany butler I ever knew before.\u2019 When that remark was repeated to\nme it became a confirmation of my theory.",
    "\u201cBut Sir Bartholomew Strange was another matter.",
    "It is hardly to be\nsupposed that his friend could take him in.",
    "he must have known of\nthe impersonation.",
    "Had we any evidence of that Yes.",
    "The acute\nMr. Satterthwaite pounced on one point quite early in the\nproceedings  the facetious remark of Sir Bartholomew totally\nuncharacteristic of his manner to servants  \u2018You\u2019re a firstclass\nbutler aren\u2019t you Ellis\u2019 A perfectly understandable remark if the\nbutler were Sir Charles Cartwright and Sir Bartholomew was in on\nthe joke.",
    "\u201cBecause that is undoubtedly how Sir Bartholomew saw the matter.",
    "The impersonation of Ellis was a joke possibly even a wager its\nculmination was designed to be the successful spoofing of the\nhouse party  hence Sir Bartholomew\u2019s remark about a surprise\nand his cheerful humour.",
    "Note too that there was still time to draw\nback.",
    "If any of the house party had spotted Charles Cartwright that\nfirst evening at the dinner table nothing irrevocable had yet\noccurred.",
    "The whole thing could have been passed off as a joke.",
    "But nobody noticed the stooping middleaged butler with his\nbelladonnadarkened eyes and his whiskers and the painted\nbirthmark on his wrist.",
    "A very subtle identifying touch that  which\ncompletely failed owing to the lack of observation of most human\nbeings The birthmark was intended to bulk largely in the\ndescription of Ellis  and in all that fortnight no one noticed it The\nonly person who did was the sharpeyed Miss Wills to whom we\nshall come presently.",
    "\u201cWhat happened next Sir Bartholomew died.",
    "His time the death\nwas not put down to natural causes.",
    "The police came.",
    "They\nquestioned Ellis and the others.",
    "Later that night \u2018Ellis\u2019 left by the\nsecret passage resumed his own personality and two days later\nwas strolling about the gardens at Monte Carlo ready to be shocked\nand surprised by the news of his friend\u2019s death.",
    "\u201cThis mind you was all theory.",
    "I had no actual proof but\neverything that arose supported that theory.",
    "My house of cards was\nwell and truly built.",
    "The blackmailing letters discovered in Ellis\u2019s\nroom But it was Sir Charles himself who discovered them\n\u201cAnd what of the supposed letter from Sir Bartholomew Strange\nasking young Manders to arrange an accident Well what could be\n\n\feasier than for Sir Charles to write that letter in Sir Bartholomew\u2019s\nname If Manders had not destroyed that letter himself Sir Charles\nin the role of Ellis can easily do so when he valets the young\ngentleman.",
    "In the same way the newspaper cutting is easily\nintroduced by Ellis into Oliver Manders\u2019s wallet.",
    "\u201cAnd now we come to the third victim  Mrs. de Rushbridger.",
    "When\ndo we first hear of Mrs. de Rushbridger Immediately after that very\nawkward chaffing reference to Ellis being the perfect butler  that\nextremely uncharacteristic utterance of Sir Bartholomew Strange.",
    "At all costs attention must be drawn away from Sir Bartholomew\u2019s\nmanner to his butler.",
    "Sir Charles quickly asks what was the\nmessage the butler had brought.",
    "It is about this woman  this\npatient of the doctor\u2019s.",
    "And immediately Sir Charles throws all his\npersonality into directing attention to this unknown woman and\naway from the butler.",
    "He goes to the Sanatorium and questions the\nMatron.",
    "He runs Mrs. de Rushbridger for all he is worth as a red\nherring.",
    "\u201cWe must now examine the part played by Miss Wills in the drama.",
    "Miss Wills has a curious personality.",
    "She is one of those people who\nare quite unable to impress themselves on their surroundings.",
    "She\nis neither goodlooking nor witty nor clever nor even particularly\nsympathetic.",
    "She is nondescript.",
    "But she is extremely observant\nand extremely intelligent.",
    "She takes her revenge on the world with\nher pen.",
    "She had the great art of being able to reproduce character\non paper.",
    "I do not know if there was anything about the butler that\nstruck Miss Wills as unusual but I do think that she was the only\nperson at the table who noticed him at all.",
    "On the morning after the\nmurder her insatiable curiosity led her to poke and pry as the\nhousemaid put it.",
    "She went into Dacres\u2019s room she went through\n\n\fthe baize door into the servants\u2019 quarters led I think by the\nmongoose instinct for finding out.",
    "\u201cShe was the only person who occasioned Sir Charles any\nuneasiness.",
    "That is why he was anxious to be the one to tackle her.",
    "He was fairly reassured by his interview and distinctly gratified that\nshe had noticed the birthmark.",
    "But after that came catastrophe.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t think that until that minute Miss Wills had connected Ellis the\nbutler with Sir Charles Cartwright.",
    "I think she had only been\nvaguely struck by some resemblance to someone in Ellis.",
    "But she\nwas an observer.",
    "When dishes were handed to her she had\nautomatically noted  not the face  but the hands that held the\ndishes.",
    "\u201cIt did not occur to her that Ellis was Sir Charles.",
    "But when Sir\nCharles was talking to her it did suddenly occur to her that Sir\nCharles was Ellis And so she asked him to pretend to hand her a\ndish of vegetables.",
    "But it was not whether the birthmark was on the\nright or the left wrist that interested her.",
    "She wanted a pretext to study his hands  hands held in the same\nposition as those of Ellis the butler.",
    "\u201cAnd so she leaped to the truth.",
    "But she was a peculiar woman.",
    "She\nenjoyed knowledge for its own sake.",
    "Besides she was by no means\nsure\n\nthat\n\nSir\n\nCharles\n\nhad\n\nmurdered\n\nhis\n\nfriend.",
    "He\n\nhad\n\nmasqueraded as a butler yes  but that did not necessarily make\nhim a murderer.",
    "Many an innocent man has kept silence because\nspeech would place him in an awkward position.",
    "\u201cSo Miss Wills kept her knowledge to herself  and enjoyed it.",
    "But\nSir Charles was worried.",
    "He did not like that expression of satisfied\n\n\fmalice on her face that he saw as he left the room.",
    "She knew\nsomething.",
    "What Did it affect him He could not be sure.",
    "But he\nfelt that it was something connected with Ellis the butler.",
    "First Mr.\nSatterthwaite  now Miss Wills.",
    "Attention must be drawn away from\nthat vital point.",
    "It must be focused definitely elsewhere.",
    "And he\nthought of a plan  simple audacious and as he fancied definitely\nmystifying.",
    "\u201cOn the day of my Sherry Party I imagine Sir Charles rose very\nearly went to Yorkshire and disguised in shabby clothes gave the\ntelegram to a small boy to send off.",
    "Then he returned to town in\ntime to act the part I had indicated in my little drama.",
    "He did one\nmore thing.",
    "He posted a box of chocolates to a woman he had never\nseen and of whom he knew nothing ...\n\u201cYou know what happened that evening.",
    "From Sir Charles\u2019s\nuneasiness I was fairly sure that Miss Wills had certain suspicions.",
    "When Sir Charles did his \u2018death scene\u2019 I watched Miss Wills\u2019s face.",
    "I\nsaw the look of astonishment that showed on it.",
    "I knew then that\nMiss Wills definitely suspected Sir Charles of being the murderer.",
    "When he appeared to die poisoned like the other two she thought\nher deductions must be wrong.",
    "\u201cBut if Miss Wills suspected Sir Charles then Miss Wills was in\nserious danger.",
    "A man who has killed twice will kill again.",
    "I uttered\na very solemn warning.",
    "Later that night I communicated with Miss\nWills by telephone and on my advice she left home suddenly the\nnext day.",
    "Since then she had been living here in this hotel.",
    "That I\nwas wise is proved by the fact that Sir Charles went out to Tooting\non the following evening after he had returned from Gilling.",
    "He was\ntoo late.",
    "The bird had flown.",
    "\u201cIn the meantime from his point of view the plan had worked well.",
    "Mrs. de Rushbridger had something of importance to tell us.",
    "Mrs.\nde Rushbridger was killed before she could speak.",
    "How dramatic\nHow like the detective stories the plays the films Again the\ncardboard and the tinsel and the painted cloth.",
    "\u201cBut I Hercule Poirot was not deceived.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite said to\nme she was killed in order that she should not speak.",
    "I agreed.",
    "He\nwent on to say she was killed before she could tell us what she\nknew.",
    "I said \u2018Or what she did NOT know.\u2019 I think he was puzzled.",
    "But he should have seen then the truth.",
    "Mrs. de Rushbridger was\nkilled because she could in actual fact have told us nothing at all.",
    "Because she had no connection with the crime.",
    "If she were to be Sir\nCharles\u2019s successful red herring  she could only be so dead.",
    "And\nso Mrs. de Rushbridger a harmless stranger was murdered ...\n\u201cYet even in that seeming triumph Sir Charles made a colossal  a\nchildish  error The telegram was addressed to me Hercule Poirot\nat the Ritz Hotel.",
    "But Mrs. de Rushbridger had never heard of my\nconnection with the case No one up in that part of the world knew\nof it.",
    "It was an unbelievably childish error.",
    "\u201cEh bien then I had reached a certain stage.",
    "I knew the identity of\nthe murderer.",
    "But I did not know the motive for the original crime.",
    "\u201cI reflected.",
    "\u201cAnd once again more clearly than ever I saw the death of Sir\nBartholomew Strange as the original and purposeful murder.",
    "What\nreason could Sir Charles Cartwright have for the murder of his\nfriend Could I imagine a motive I thought I could.\u201d\n\n\fThere was a deep sigh.",
    "Sir Charles Cartwright rose slowly to his\nfeet and strolled to the fireplace.",
    "He stood there his hand on his\nhip looking down at Poirot.",
    "His attitude Mr. Satterthwaite could\nhave told you was that of Lord Eaglemount as he looks scornfully\nat the rascally solicitor who has succeeded in fastening an\naccusation of fraud upon him.",
    "He radiated nobility and disgust.",
    "He\nwas the aristocrat looking down at the ignoble canaille.",
    "\u201cYou have an extraordinary imagination M. Poirot he said.",
    "It\u2019s\nhardly worth while saying that there\u2019s not one single word of truth\nin your story.",
    "How you have the damned impertinence to dish up\nsuch an absurd fandangle of lies I don\u2019t know.",
    "But go on I am\ninterested.",
    "What was my motive for murdering a man whom I had\nknown ever since boyhood\u201d\nHercule Poirot the little bourgeois looked up at the aristocrat.",
    "He\nspoke quickly but firmly.",
    "\u201cSir Charles we have a proverb that says \u2018Cherchez la femme.\u2019 It\nwas there that I found my motive.",
    "I had seen you with Mademoiselle\nLytton Gore.",
    "It was clear that you loved her  loved her with that\nterrible absorbing passion that comes to a middleaged man and\nwhich is usually inspired by an innocent girl.",
    "\u201cYou loved her.",
    "She I could see had the hero worship for you.",
    "You\nhad only to speak and she would fall into your arms.",
    "But you did not\nspeak.",
    "Why\n\u201cYou pretended to your friend Mr. Satterthwaite that you were the\ndense lover who cannot recognise his mistress\u2019s answering\npassion.",
    "You pretended to think that Miss Lytton Gore was in love\nwith Oliver Manders.",
    "But I say Sir Charles that you are a man of\n\n\fthe world.",
    "You are a man with a great experience of women.",
    "You\ncannot have been deceived.",
    "You knew perfectly well that Miss\nLytton Gore cared for you.",
    "Why then did you not marry her You\nwanted to do so.",
    "\u201cIt must be that there was some obstacle.",
    "What could that obstacle\nbe It could only be the fact that you already had a wife.",
    "But nobody\never spoke of you as a married man.",
    "You passed always as a\nbachelor.",
    "The marriage then had taken place when you were very\nyoung  before you became known as a rising young actor.",
    "\u201cWhat had happened to your wife If she were still alive why did\nnobody know about her If you were living apart there was the\nremedy of divorce.",
    "If your wife was a Catholic or one who\ndisapproved of divorce she would still be known as living apart\nfrom you.",
    "\u201cBut there are two tragedies where the law gives no relief.",
    "The\nwoman you married might be serving a life sentence in some\nprison or she might be confined in a lunatic asylum.",
    "In neither case\ncould you obtain a divorce and if it had happened while you were\nstill a boy nobody might know about it.",
    "\u201cIf nobody knew you might marry Miss Lytton Gore without telling\nher the truth.",
    "But supposing one person knew  a friend who had\nknown you all your life Sir Bartholomew Strange was an\nhonourable upright physician.",
    "He might pity you deeply he might\nsympathise with a liaison or an irregular life but he would not stand\nby silent and see you enter into a bigamous marriage with an\nunsuspecting young girl.",
    "Before you could marry Miss Lytton Gore Sir Bartholomew Strange\nmust be removed ... \u201d\nSir Charles laughed.",
    "\u201cAnd dear old Babbington Did he know all about it too\u201d\n\u201cI fancied so at first.",
    "But I soon found that there was no evidence to\nsupport that theory.",
    "Besides my original stumbling block\nremained.",
    "Even if it was you who put the nicotine into the cocktail\nglass you could not have ensured its reaching one particular\nperson.",
    "\u201cThat was my problem.",
    "And suddenly a chance word from Miss\nLytton Gore showed me light.\u201d\n\u201cThe poison was not intended especially for Stephen Babbington.",
    "It\nwas intended for any one of those present with three exceptions.",
    "These exceptions were Miss Lytton Gore to whom you were careful\nto hand an innocent glass yourself and Sir Bartholomew Strange\nwho you knew did not drink cocktails.\u201d\nMr. Satterthwaite cried out\n\u201cBut that\u2019s nonsense What\u2019s the point of it There isn\u2019t any.\u201d\nPoirot turned towards him.",
    "Triumph came into his voice.",
    "\u201cOh yes there is.",
    "A queer point  a very queer point.",
    "The only time I\nhave come across such a motive for murder.",
    "The murder of\nStephen Babbington was neither more nor less than a dress\nrehearsal.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes Sir Charles was an actor.",
    "He obeyed his actor\u2019s instinct.",
    "He\ntried out his murder before committing it.",
    "No suspicion could\npossibly attach to him.",
    "Not one of those people\u2019s deaths could\nbenefit him in any way and moreover as everyone has found he\ncould not have been proved to have poisoned any particular\nperson.",
    "And my friends the dress rehearsal went well.",
    "Mr.\nBabbington dies and foul play is not even suspected.",
    "It is left to Sir\nCharles to urge that suspicion and he is highly gratified at our\nrefusal to take it seriously.",
    "The substitution of the glass too that\nhas gone without a hitch.",
    "In fact he can be sure that when the real\nperformance comes it will be \u2018all right on the night.\u2019\n\u201cAs you know events took a slightly different turn.",
    "On the second\noccasion a doctor was present who immediately suspected poison.",
    "It was then to Sir Charles\u2019s interests to stress the death of\nBabbington.",
    "Sir Bartholomew\u2019s death must be presumed to be the\noutcome of the earlier death.",
    "Attention must be focused on the\nmotive for Babbington\u2019s murder not on any motive that might exist\nfor Sir Bartholomew\u2019s removal.",
    "\u201cBut there was one thing that Sir Charles failed to realise  the\nefficient watchfulness of Miss Milray.",
    "Miss Milray knew that her\nemployer dabbled in chemical experiments in the tower in the\ngarden.",
    "Miss Milray paid bills for rose spraying solution and\nrealised that quite a lot of it had unaccountably disappeared.",
    "When\nshe read that Mr. Babbington had died of nicotine poisoning her\nclever brain leaped at once to the conclusion that Sir Charles had\nextracted the pure alkaloid from the rose solution.",
    "\u201cAnd Miss Milray did not know what to do for she had known Mr.\nBabbington as a little girl and she was in love deeply and\ndevotedly as an ugly woman can be with her fascinating employer.",
    "\u201cIn the end she decided to destroy Sir Charles\u2019s apparatus.",
    "Sir\nCharles himself had been so cocksure of his success that he had\nnever thought it necessary.",
    "She went down to Cornwall and I\nfollowed.\u201d\nAgain Sir Charles laughed.",
    "More than ever he looked a fine\ngentleman disgusted by a rat.",
    "\u201cIs some old chemical apparatus all your evidence\u201d he demanded\ncontemptuously.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThere is your passport showing the dates when\nyou returned to and left England.",
    "And there is the fact that in the\nHarverton County Asylum there is a woman Gladys Mary Mugg the\nwife of Charles Mugg.\u201d\nEgg had so far sat silent  a frozen figure.",
    "But now she stirred.",
    "A\nlittle cry  almost a moan  came from her.",
    "Sir Charles turned superbly.",
    "\u201cEgg you don\u2019t believe a word of this absurd story do you\u201d\nHe laughed.",
    "His hands were outstretched.",
    "Egg came slowly forward as though hypnotised.",
    "Her eyes\nappealing tortured gazed into her lover\u2019s.",
    "And then just before\nshe reached him she wavered her glance fell went this way and\nthat as though seeking for reassurance.",
    "Then with a cry she fell on her knees by Poirot.",
    "\u201cIs this true Is this true\u201d\nHe put both hands on her shoulders s firm kindly touch.",
    "\u201cIt is true mademoiselle.\u201d\nThere was no sound then but Egg\u2019s sobs.",
    "Sir Charles seemed suddenly to have aged.",
    "It was an old man\u2019s\nface a leering satyr\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cGod damn you\u201d he said.",
    "And never in all his acting career had words come with such utter\nand compelling malignancy.",
    "Then he turned and went out of the room.",
    "Mr. Satterthwaite half sprang up from his chair but Poirot shook his\nhead his hand still gently stroking the sobbing girl.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019ll escape\u201d said Mr. Satterthwaite.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo he will only choose his exit.",
    "The slow one before the eyes of\nthe world or the quick one off stage.\u201d\nThe door opened softly and someone came in.",
    "it was Oliver\nManders.",
    "His usual sneering expression was gone.",
    "He looked white\nand unhappy.",
    "Poirot bent over the girl.",
    "\u201cSee mademoiselle\u201d he said gently.",
    "\u201cHere is a friend come to take\nyou home.\u201d\nEgg rose to her feet.",
    "She looked uncertainly towards Oliver then\nmade a step stumblingly towards him.",
    "\u201cOliver ... Take me to Mother.",
    "Oh take me to Mother.\u201d\nHe put an arm round her and drew her towards the door.",
    "\u201cYes dear I\u2019ll take you.",
    "Come.\u201d\nEgg\u2019s legs were trembling so that she could hardly walk.",
    "Between\nthem Oliver and Mr. Satterthwaite guided her footsteps.",
    "At the door\nshe took a hold upon herself and threw back her head.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d\nPoirot made a gesture and Oliver Manders cane back into the\nroom.",
    "\u201cBe very good to her\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI will Sir.",
    "She\u2019s all I care about in the world  you know that.",
    "Love\nfor her made me bitter and cynical.",
    "But I shall be different now.",
    "I\u2019m\nready to stand by.",
    "And some day perhaps  \u201d\n\u201cI think so\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI think she was beginning to care for you\nwhen he came along and dazzled her.",
    "Hero worship is a real and\nterrible danger to the young.",
    "Some day Egg will fall in love with a\nfriend and build her happiness upon rock.\u201d\nHe looked kindly after the young man as he left the room.",
    "Presently Mr. Satterthwaite returned.",
    "\u201cM.",
