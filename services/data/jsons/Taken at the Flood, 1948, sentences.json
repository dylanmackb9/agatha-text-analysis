    "Major Porter paused.",
    "Nobody displayed any interest or asked him to\ncontinue.",
    "Newspapers were held up sedulously in front of faces but it\ntook more than that to discourage Major Porter.",
    "He always had long\nhistories to relate mostly about people whom nobody knew.",
    "Interesting said Major Porter firmly his eyes fixed absently on a\npair of extremely pointed patent leather shoes  a type of footwear of\nwhich he profoundly disapproved.",

    "Foreign of course That explained the shoes.",
    "Really thought Major\nPorter whats the club coming to Cant get away from foreigners\neven here.",

    "She cant be more than about twentyfive he went on.",
    "And a widow\nfor the second time.",
    "Or at any rate  thats what she thinks...",
    "He paused hoping for curiosity  for comment.",

    "Might be\nawkward for her some day I warned him.",
    "Oh no he says Id play\nthe game.",
    "Robert Underhay would be dead all right.",
    "Well I didnt think any more of it but six months later I heard that\nUnderhay had died of fever up in the bush somewhere.",
    "His natives\nwere a trustworthy lot and they came back with a good circumstantial\ntale and a few last words scrawled in Underhays writing saying theyd\ndone all they could for him and he was afraid he was pegging out and\npraising up his headman.",
    "That man was devoted to him and so were all\nthe others.",
    "Whatever he told them to swear to they would swear to.",
    "So\nthere it is... Maybe Underhays buried up country in the midst of\nequatorial Africa but maybe he isnt  and if he isnt Mrs Gordon Cloade\nmay get a shock one day.",
    "And serve her right I say.",
    "I never met her\nbut I know the sound of a little gold digger She broke up poor old\nUnderhay all right.",
    "Its an interesting story.",
    "Major Porter looked round rather wistfully for confirmation of this\nassertion.",
    "He met two bored and fishy stares the halfaverted gaze of\nyoung Mr Mellon and the polite attention of M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "Then the newspaper rustled and a greyhaired man with a singularly\nimpassive face rose quietly from his armchair by the fire and went out.",
    "Major Porters jaw dropped and young Mr Mellon gave a faint whistle.",
    "Now youve done it he remarked.",
    "Know who that was\n\nGod bless my soul said Major Porter in some agitation.",
    "Of course.",
    "I\ndont know him intimately but we are acquainted... Jeremy Cloade\nisnt it Gordon Cloades brother Upon my word how extremely\nunfortunate If Id had any idea \n\nHes a solicitor said young Mr Mellon.",
    "Bet he sues you for slander\nor defamation of character or something.",
    "For young Mr Mellon enjoyed creating alarm and despondency in such\nplaces as it was not forbidden by the Defence of the Realm Act.",
    "Major Porter continued to repeat in an agitated manner\n\nMost unfortunate.",
    "Most unfortunate\n\nIt will be all over Warmsley Heath by this evening said Mr Mellon.",
    "Thats where all the Cloades hang out.",
    "Theyll sit up late discussing\nwhat action to take.",
    "But at that moment the All Clear sounded and young Mr Mellon\nstopped being malicious and tenderly piloted his friend Hercule Poirot\nout into the street.",
    "Terrible atmosphere these clubs he said.",
    "The most crashing\ncollection of old bores.",
    "Porters easily the worst though.",
    "His\ndescription of the Indian rope trick takes three quarters of an hour\nand he knows everybody whose mother ever passed through Poona\n\nThis was in the Autumn of 1944.",
    "It was in late Spring 1946 that\nHercule Poirot received a visit.",
    "II\n\nHercule Poirot was sitting at his neat writingdesk on a pleasant May\nmorning when his manservant George approached him and murmured\ndeferentially\n\nThere is a lady sir asking to see you.",
    "What kind of a lady Poirot asked cautiously.",
    "He always enjoyed the meticulous accuracy of Georges descriptions.",
    "She would be aged between forty and fifty I should say sir.",
    "Untidy\nand somewhat artistic in appearance.",
    "Good walkingshoes brogues.",
    "A\ntweed coat and skirt  but a lace blouse.",
    "Some questionable Egyptian\nbeads and a blue chiffon scarf.",
    "Poirot shuddered slightly.",
    "I do not think he said that I wish to see her.",
    "Shall I tell her sir that you are indisposed\n\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.",
    "You have already I gather told her that I am engaged on important\nbusiness and cannot be disturbed\n\nGeorge coughed again.",
    "She said sir that she had come up from the country specially and\ndid not mind how long she waited.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "One should never struggle against the inevitable he said.",
    "If a\nmiddleaged lady wearing sham Egyptian beads has made up her mind\nto see the famous Hercule Poirot and has come up from the country to\ndo so nothing will deflect her.",
    "She will sit there in the hall till she gets\nher way.",
    "Show her in George.",
    "George retreated returning presently to announce formally\n\nMrs Cloade.",
    "The figure in the worn tweeds and the floating scarf came in with a\nbeaming face.",
    "She advanced to Poirot with an outstretched hand all\nher bead necklaces swinging and clinking.",
    "M. Poirot she said I have come to you under spirit guidance.",
    "Poirot blinked slightly.",
    "Indeed Madame.",
    "Perhaps you will take a seat and tell me \n\nHe got no further.",
    "Both ways M. Poirot.",
    "With the automatic writing and with the ouija\nboard.",
    "It was the night before last.",
    "Madame Elvary a wonderful\nwoman she is and I were using the board.",
    "We got the same initials\nrepeatedly.",
    "H.P.",
    "H.P.",
    "H.P.",
    "Of course I did not get the true significance\nat once.",
    "It takes you know a little time.",
    "One cannot on this earthly\nplane see clearly.",
    "I racked my brains thinking of someone with those\ninitials.",
    "I knew it must connect up with the last seance  really a most\npoignant one but it was some time before I got it.",
    "And then I bought a\ncopy of Picture Post Spirit guidance again you see because usually I\nbuy the New Statesman and there you were  a picture of you and\ndescribed and an account of what you had done.",
    "It is wonderful dont\nyou think M. Poirot how everything has a purpose Clearly you are\nthe person appointed by the Guides to elucidate this matter.",
    "Poirot surveyed her thoughtfully.",
    "Strangely enough the thing that really caught his attention was that\nshe had remarkably shrewd lightblue eyes.",
    "They gave point as it\nwere to her rambling method of approach.",
    "And what Mrs  Cloade  is that right He frowned.",
    "I seem to have\nheard the name some time ago \n\nShe nodded vehemently.",
    "My poor brotherinlaw  Gordon.",
    "Immensely rich and often mentioned\nin the press.",
    "He was killed in the Blitz over a year ago  a great blow to\nall of us.",
    "My husband is his younger brother.",
    "He is a doctor.",
    "Dr Lionel\nCloade... Of course she added lowering her voice he has no idea\nthat I am consulting you.",
    "He would not approve.",
    "Doctors I find have a\nvery materialistic outlook.",
    "The spiritual seems to be strangely hidden\nfrom them.",
    "They pin their faith on Science  but what I say is... what is\nScience  what can it do\n\nThere seemed to Hercule Poirot to be no answer to the question\nother than a meticulous and painstaking description embracing\nPasteur Lister Humphrey Davys safety lamp  the convenience of\nelectricity in the home and several hundred other kindred items.",
    "But\nthat naturally was not the answer Mrs Lionel Cloade wanted.",
    "In actual\nfact her question like so many questions was not really a question at\nall.",
    "It was a mere rhetorical gesture.",
    "Hercule Poirot contented himself with inquiring in a practical manner\n\nIn what way do you believe I can help you Mrs Cloade\n\nDo you believe in the reality of the spirit world M. Poirot\n\nI am a good Catholic said Poirot cautiously.",
    "Mrs Cloade waved aside the Catholic faith with a smile of pity.",
    "Blind The Church is blind  prejudiced foolish  not welcoming the\nreality and beauty of the world that lies behind this one.",
    "At twelve oclock said Hercule Poirot I have an important\nappointment.",
    "It was a welltimed remark.",
    "Mrs Cloade leaned forward.",
    "I must come to the point at once.",
    "Would it be possible for you M.\nPoirot to find a missing person\n\nPoirots eyebrows rose.",
    "It might be possible  yes he replied cautiously.",
    "But the police my\ndear Mrs Cloade could do so a great deal more easily than I could.",
    "They have all the necessary machinery.",
    "Mrs Cloade waved away the police as she had waved away the\nCatholic Church.",
    "No M. Poirot  it is to you I have been guided  by those beyond the\nveil.",
    "Now listen.",
    "My brother Gordon married some weeks before his\ndeath a young widow  a Mrs Underhay.",
    "Her first husband poor child\nsuch a grief to her was reported dead in Africa.",
    "A mysterious country\n Africa.",
    "A mysterious continent Poirot corrected her.",
    "Possibly.",
    "What part \n\nShe swept on.",
    "Central Africa.",
    "The home of voodoo of the zhombie \n\n\fThe zhombie is in the West Indies.",
    "Mrs Cloade swept on \n\n of black magic  of strange and secret practices  a country where a\nman could disappear and never be heard of again.",
    "Possibly possibly said Poirot.",
    "But the same is true of Piccadilly\nCircus.",
    "Mrs Cloade waved away Piccadilly Circus.",
    "Twice lately M. Poirot a communication has come through from a\nspirit who gives his name as Robert.",
    "The message was the same each\ntime.",
    "Not dead... We were puzzled we knew no Robert.",
    "Asking for\nfurther guidance we got this.",
    "R.U.",
    "R.U.",
    "R.U.",
    "then Tell R. Tell R. Tell\nRobert we asked.",
    "No from Robert.",
    "R.U.",
    "What does the U. stand\nfor Then M. Poirot the most significant answer came.",
    "Little Boy\nBlue.",
    "Little Boy Blue.",
    "Ha ha ha You see\n\nNo said Poirot I do not.",
    "She looked at him pityingly.",
    "The nursery rhyme Little Boy Blue.",
    "Under the Haycock fast asleep Under hay  you see\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He forbore to ask why if the name Robert could be\nspelt out the name Underhay could not have been treated the same\n\n\fway and why it had been necessary to resort to a kind of cheap Secret\nService spy jargon.",
    "And my sisterinlaws name is Rosaleen finished Mrs Cloade\ntriumphantly.",
    "You see Confusing all these Rs.",
    "But the meaning is quite plain.",
    "Tell\nRosaleen that Robert Underhay is not dead.",
    "Aha and did you tell her\n\nMrs Cloade looked slightly taken aback.",
    "Er  well  no.",
    "You see I mean  well people are so sceptical.",
    "Rosaleen I am sure would be so.",
    "And then poor child it might upset\nher  wondering you know where he was  and what he was doing.",
    "Besides projecting his voice through the ether Quite so.",
    "A curious\nmethod surely of announcing his safety\n\nAh M. Poirot you are not an initiate.",
    "And how do we know what the\ncircumstances are Poor Captain Underhay or is it Major Underhay\nmay be a prisoner somewhere in the dark interior of Africa.",
    "But if he\ncould be found M. Poirot.",
    "If he could be restored to his dear young\nRosaleen.",
    "Think of her happiness Oh M. Poirot I have been sent to\nyou  surely surely you will not refuse the behest of the spiritual\nworld.",
    "Poirot looked at her reflectively.",
    "My fees he said softly are very expensive.",
    "I may say enormously\nexpensive And the task you suggest would not be easy.",
    "Oh dear  but surely  it is most unfortunate.",
    "I and my husband are\nvery badly off  very badly off indeed.",
    "Actually my own plight is worse\nthan my dear husband knows.",
    "I bought some shares  under spirit\nguidance  and so far they have proved very disappointing  in fact\nquite alarming.",
    "They have gone right down and are now I gather\npractically unsaleable.",
    "She looked at him with dismayed blue eyes.",
    "I have not dared to tell my husband.",
    "I simply tell you in order to\nexplain how I am situated.",
    "But surely dear M. Poirot to reunite a\nyoung husband and wife  it is such a noble mission \n\nNobility ch\u00e8re Madame will not pay steamer and railway and air\ntravel fares.",
    "Nor will it cover the cost of long telegrams and cables\nand the interrogations of witnesses.",
    "But if he is found  if Captain Underhay is found alive and well  then well I think I may safely say that once that was accomplished there there would be no difficulty about  er  reimbursing you.",
    "Ah he is rich then this Captain Underhay\n\nNo.",
    "Well no...",
    "But I can assure you  I can give you my word  that that the money situation will not present difficulties.",
    "Slowly Poirot shook his head.",
    "I am sorry Madame.",
    "The answer is no.",
    "He had a little difficulty in getting her to accept that answer.",
    "When she had finally gone away he stood lost in thought frowning to\nhimself.",
    "He remembered now why the name of Cloade was familiar to him.",
    "The\nconversation at the club the day of the Air Raid came back to him.",
    "The\nbooming boring voice of Major Porter going on and on telling a story\nto which nobody wanted to listen.",
    "He remembered the rustle of a newspaper and Major Porters suddenly\ndropped jaw and expression of consternation.",
    "But what worried him was trying to make up his mind about the eager\nmiddleaged lady who had just left him.",
    "The glib spiritualistic patter\nthe vagueness the floating scarves the chains and amulets jingling\nround her neck  and finally slightly at variance with all this that\nsudden shrewd glint in a pair of paleblue eyes.",
    "Just why exactly did she come to me he said to himself.",
    "And what\nI wonder has been going on in  he looked down at the card on his\ndesk  Warmsley Vale.",
    "It was exactly five days later that he saw a small paragraph in an\nevening paper  it referred to the death of a man called Enoch Arden at Warmsley Vale a small oldworld village about three miles from the\npopular Warmsley Heath Golf Course.",
    "Hercule Poirot said to himself again I wonder what has been going on\nin Warmsley Vale...\n\nBOOK I\n\nChapter 1\n\nWarmsley Heath consists of a Golf Course two Hotels some very\nexpensive modern villas giving on to the Golf Course a row of what\nwere before the war luxury shops and a railway station.",
    "Emerging from the railway station a main road roars its way to London\non your left  to your right a small path across a field is signposted\nFootpath to Warmsley Vale.",
    "Warmsley Vale tucked away amongst wooded hills is as unlike\nWarmsley Heath as well can be.",
    "It is in essence a microscopic oldfashioned market town now degenerated into a village.",
    "It has a main\nstreet of Georgian houses several pubs a few unfashionable shops\nand a general air of being a hundred and fifty instead of twentyeight\nmiles from London.",
    "Its occupants one and all unite in despising the mushroom growth of\nWarmsley Heath.",
    "On the outskirts are some charming houses with pleasant oldworld\ngardens.",
    "It was to one of these houses the White House that Lynn\nMarchmont returned in the early spring of 1946 when she was\ndemobbed from the Wrens.",
    "On her third morning she looked out of her bedroom window across\nthe untidy lawn to the elms in the meadow beyond and sniffed the air\nhappily.",
    "It was a gentle grey morning with a smell of soft wet earth.",
    "The\nkind of smell that she had been missing for the past two years and a\nhalf.",
    "Wonderful to be home again wonderful to be here in her own little\nbedroom which she had thought of so often and so nostalgically whilst\nshe had been overseas.",
    "Wonderful to be out of uniform to be able to\nget into a tweed skirt and a jumper  even if the moths had been rather\ntoo industrious during the war years\n\nIt was good to be out of the Wrens and a free woman again although\nshe had really enjoyed her overseas service very much.",
    "The work had\nbeen reasonably interesting there had been parties plenty of fun but\nthere had also been the irksomeness of routine and the feeling of\nbeing herded together with her companions which had sometimes\nmade her feel desperately anxious to escape.",
    "It was then during the long scorching summer out East that she had\nthought so longingly of Warmsley Vale and the shabby cool pleasant\nhouse and of dear Mums.",
    "Lynn both loved her mother and was irritated by her.",
    "Far away from\nhome she had loved her still and had forgotten the irritation or\nremembered it only with an additional homesick pang.",
    "Darling Mums\nso completely maddening What she would not have given to have\nheard Mums enunciate one clich\u00e9 in her sweet complaining voice.",
    "Oh\nto be at home again and never never to have to leave home again\n\n\fAnd now here she was out of the Service free and back at the White\nHouse.",
    "She had been back three days.",
    "And already a curious dissatisfied\nrestlessness was creeping over her.",
    "It was all the same  almost too\nmuch all the same  the house and Mums and Rowley and the farm and\nthe family.",
    "The thing that was different and that ought not to be\ndifferent was herself...",
    "Darling... Mrs Marchmonts thin cry came up the stairs.",
    "Shall I bring\nmy girl a nice tray in bed\n\nLynn called out sharply\n\nOf course not.",
    "Im coming down.",
    "And why she thought has Mums got to say my girl.",
    "Its so silly\n\nShe ran downstairs and entered the diningroom.",
    "It was not a very\ngood breakfast.",
    "Already Lynn was realising the undue proportion of\ntime and interest taken by the search for food.",
    "Except for a rather\nunreliable woman who came four mornings a week Mrs Marchmont\nwas alone in the house struggling with cooking and cleaning.",
    "She had\nbeen nearly forty when Lynn was born and her health was not good.",
    "Also Lynn realised with some dismay how their financial position had\nchanged.",
    "The small but adequate fixed income which had kept them\ngoing comfortably before the war was now almost halved by taxation.",
    "Rates expenses wages had all gone up.",
    "Oh brave new world thought Lynn grimly.",
    "Her eyes rested lightly on\nthe columns of the daily paper.",
    "ExW.A.A.F.",
    "seeks\n\npost\n\nwhere\n\ninitiative\n\nand\n\ndrive\n\nwill\n\nbe\n\nappreciated.",
    "Former W.R.E.N.",
    "seeks post where organising ability and authority\nare needed.",
    "Enterprise initiative command those were the commodities offered.",
    "But what was wanted People who could cook and clean or write\ndecent shorthand.",
    "Plodding people who knew a routine and could give\ngood service.",
    "Well it didnt affect her.",
    "Her way ahead lay clear.",
    "Marriage to her\ncousin Rowley Cloade.",
    "They had got engaged seven years ago just\nbefore the outbreak of war.",
    "Always as long as she could remember\nshe had meant to marry Rowley.",
    "His choice of a farming life had been\nacquiesced in readily by her.",
    "A good life  not exciting perhaps and\nwith plenty of hard work but they both loved the open air and the care\nof animals.",
    "Not that their prospects were quite what they had been  Uncle Gordon\nhad always promised...\n\nMrs Marchmonts voice broke in plaintively opposite\n\nIts been the most dreadful blow to us all Lynn darling as I wrote you.",
    "Gordon had only been in England two days.",
    "We hadnt even seen him.",
    "If only he hadnt stayed in London.",
    "If hed come straight down here.",
    "Yes if only...\n\nFar away Lynn had been shocked and grieved by the news of her\nuncles death but the true significance of it was only now beginning to\ncome home to her.",
    "For as long as she could remember her life all their lives had been\ndominated by Gordon Cloade.",
    "The rich childless man had taken all his\nrelatives completely under his wing.",
    "Even Rowley... Rowley and his friend Johnnie Vavasour had started in\npartnership on the farm.",
    "Their capital was small but they had been full\nof hope and energy.",
    "And Gordon Cloade had approved.",
    "To her he had\nsaid more.",
    "You cant get anywhere in farming without capital.",
    "But the first thing\nto find out is whether these boys have really got the will and the energy\nto make a go of it.",
    "If I set them up now I wouldnt know that  maybe for\nyears.",
    "If theyve got the right stuff in them if Im satisfied that their side\nof it is all right well then Lynn you neednt worry.",
    "Ill finance them on\nthe proper scale.",
    "So dont think badly of your prospects my girl.",
    "Youre just the wife Rowley needs.",
    "But keep what Ive told you under\nyour hat.",
    "Well she had done that but Rowley himself had sensed his uncles\nbenevolent interest.",
    "It was up to him to prove to the old boy that\nRowley and Johnnie were a good investment for money.",
    "Yes they had all depended on Gordon Cloade.",
    "Not that any of the\nfamily had been spongers or idlers.",
    "Jeremy Cloade was senior partner\nin a firm of solicitors Lionel Cloade was in practice as a doctor.",
    "But behind the workaday life was the comforting assurance of money\nin the background.",
    "There was never any need to stint or to save.",
    "The\nfuture was assured.",
    "Gordon Cloade a childless widower would see to\nthat.",
    "He had told them all more than once that that was so.",
    "His widowed sister Adela Marchmont had stayed on at the White\nHouse when she might perhaps have moved into a smaller more\nlaboursaving house.",
    "Lynn went to firstclass schools.",
    "If the war had\nnot come she would have been able to take any kind of expensive\ntraining she had pleased.",
    "Cheques from Uncle Gordon flowed in with\ncomfortable regularity to provide little luxuries.",
    "Everything had been so settled so secure.",
    "And then had come Gordon Cloades wholly unexpected marriage.",
    "Of course darling Adela went on we were all flabbergasted.",
    "If\nthere was one thing that seemed quite certain it was that Gordon\nwould never marry again.",
    "It wasnt you see as though he hadnt got\nplenty of family ties.",
    "Yes thought Lynn plenty of family.",

    "Though perhaps\njust a weeny bit tyrannical on occasions.",
    "He never liked the habit of\n\n\fdining off a polished table.",
    "Always insisted on my sticking to the oldfashioned tablecloths.",
    "In fact he sent me the most beautiful Venetian\nlace ones when he was in Italy.",
    "It certainly paid to fall in with his wishes said Lynn dryly.",
    "She added\nwith some curiosity How did he meet this  second wife You never\ntold me in your letters.",
    "Oh my dear on some boat or plane or other.",
    "Coming from South\nAmerica to New York I believe.",
    "After all those years And after all\nthose secretaries and typists and housekeepers and everything.",
    "Lynn smiled.",
    "Ever since she could remember Gordon Cloades\nsecretaries housekeepers and office staff had been subjected to the\nclosest scrutiny and suspicion.",
    "She asked curiously Shes goodlooking I suppose\n\nWell dear said Adela I think myself she has rather a silly face.",
    "Youre not a man Mums\n\nOf course Mrs Marchmont went on the poor girl was blitzed and\nhad shock from blast and was really frightfully ill and all that and its\nmy opinion shes never really quite recovered.",
    "Shes a mass of nerves\nif you know what I mean.",
    "And really sometimes she looks quite halfwitted.",
    "I dont feel she could ever have made much of a companion for\npoor Gordon.",
    "Lynn smiled.",
    "She doubted whether Gordon Cloade had chosen to\nmarry a woman years younger than himself for her intellectual\ncompanionship.",
    "And then dear Mrs Marchmont lowered her voice I hate to say it\nbut of course shes not a lady\n\nWhat an expression Mums What does that matter nowadays\n\nIt still matters in the country dear said Adela placidly.",
    "I simply\nmean that she isnt exactly one of us.",
    "Poor little devil\n\nReally Lynn I dont know what you mean.",
    "We have all been most\ncareful to be kind and polite and to welcome her amongst us for\nGordons sake.",
    "Shes at Furrowbank then Lynn asked curiously.",
    "Yes naturally.",
    "Where else was there for her to go when she came out\nof the nursing home The doctors said she must be out of London.",
    "Shes at Furrowbank with her brother.",
    "Whats he like Lynn asked.",
    "A dreadful young man Mrs Marchmont paused and then added with\na good deal of intensity Rude.",
    "A momentary flicker of sympathy crossed Lynns mind.",
    "She thought I\nbet Id be rude in his place\n\nShe asked Whats his name\n\nHunter.",
    "David Hunter.",
    "Irish I believe.",
    "Of course they are not people\none has ever heard of.",
    "She was a widow  a Mrs Underhay.",
    "One doesnt\nwish to be uncharitable but one cant help asking oneself  what kind\nof a widow would be likely to be travelling about from South America in\nwartime One cant help feeling you know that she was just looking\nfor a rich husband.",
    "In which case she didnt look in vain remarked Lynn.",
    "Mrs Marchmont sighed.",
    "It seems so extraordinary.",
    "Gordon was such a shrewd man always.",
    "And it wasnt I mean that women hadnt tried.",
    "That last secretary but\none for instance.",
    "Really quite blatant.",
    "She was very efficient I believe\nbut he had to get rid other.",
    "Lynn said vaguely I suppose theres always a Waterloo.",
    "Sixtytwo said Mrs Marchmont.",
    "A very dangerous age.",
    "And a war I\nimagine is unsettling.",
    "But I cant tell you what a shock it was when we\ngot his letter from New York.",
    "What did it say exactly\n\n\fHe wrote to Frances  I really cant think why.",
    "Perhaps he imagined\nthat owing to her upbringing she might be more sympathetic.",
    "He said\nthat wed probably be surprised to hear that he was married.",
    "It had all\nbeen rather sudden but he was sure we should all soon grow very\nfond of Rosaleen such a very theatrical name dont you think dear I\nmean definitely rather bogus.",
    "She had had a very sad life he said and\nhad gone through a lot although she was so young.",
    "Really it was\nwonderful the plucky way she had stood up to life.",
    "Quite a wellknown gambit murmured Lynn.",
    "Oh I know.",
    "I do agree.",
    "One has heard it so many times.",
    "But one would\nreally think that Gordon with all his experience  still there it is.",
    "She\nhas the most enormous eyes  dark blue and what they call put in with\na smutty finger.",
    "Attractive\n\nOh yes she is certainly very pretty.",
    "Its not the kind of prettiness I\nadmire.",
    "It never is said Lynn with a wry smile.",
    "No dear.",
    "Really men  but well theres no accounting for men Even\nthe most wellbalanced of them do the most incredibly foolish things\nGordons letter went on to say that we mustnt think for a moment that\nthis would mean any loosening of old ties.",
    "He still considered us all his\nspecial responsibility.",
    "But he didnt said Lynn make a will after his marriage\n\n\fMrs Marchmont shook her head.",
    "The last will he made was in 1940.",
    "I dont know any details but he\ngave us to understand at the time that we were all taken care of by it if\nanything should happen to him.",

    "He was killed practically the day\nafter he landed in this country.",
    "And so she  Rosaleen  gets everything\n\nYes.",
    "The old will was invalidated by his marriage.",
    "Lynn was silent.",
    "She was not more mercenary than most but she\nwould not have been human if she had not resented the new state of\naffairs.",
    "It was not she felt at all what Gordon Cloade himself would\nhave envisaged.",
    "The bulk of his fortune he might have left to his young\nwife but certain provisions he would certainly have made for the\nfamily he had encouraged to depend upon him.",
    "Again and again he had\nurged them not to save not to make provision for the future.",
    "She had\nheard him say to Jeremy Youll be a rich man when I die.",
    "To her\nmother he had often said Dont worry Adela.",

    "And look at all these she wailed.",
    "What am I to do What on earth\nam I to do Lynn The bank manager wrote me only this morning that\nIm overdrawn.",
    "I dont see how I can be.",
    "Ive been so careful.",
    "But it\nseems my investments just arent producing what they used to.",
    "Increased taxation he says.",
    "And all these yellow things.",
    "War Damage\nInsurance or something  one has to pay them whether one wants to or\nnot.",
    "Lynn took the bills and glanced through them.",
    "There were no records\nof extravagance amongst them.",

    "It was noted enviously in Warmsley Vale that if any one had servants it\nwould be Frances Cloade.",
    "She did not bribe them with extravagant\nwages and she was exacting as to performance  but her warm\napproval of endeavour and her infectious energy and drive made of\ndomestic service something creative and personal.",
    "She had been so used to being waited on all her life that she took it for\ngranted\n\nwithout\n\nselfconsciousness\n\nand\n\nshe\n\nhad\n\nthe\n\nsame\n\nappreciation of a good cook or a good parlourmaid as she would have\nhad for a good pianist.",

    "But Lord\n\n\fEdward had escaped with his reputation only lightly tarnished and had\nreached an arrangement with his creditors which permitted him to live\nexceedingly comfortably in the South of France.",
    "And for these\nunexpected blessings he had to thank the shrewdness and special\nexertions of his solicitor Jeremy Cloade.",
    "Cloade had done a good deal\nmore than a solicitor usually does for a client and had even advanced\nguarantees of his own.",
    "He had made it clear that he had a deep\nadmiration for Frances Trenton and in due course when her fathers\naffairs had been satisfactorily wound up Frances became Mrs Jeremy\nCloade.",
    "What she had felt about it no one had ever known.",
    "All that could be\nsaid was that she had kept her side of the bargain admirably.",

    "Although\nJeremy Cloade did not know it himself the gesture was a characteristic\none and coincided with inner perturbation.",
    "Frances had not observed\nit very often.",
    "Once when Antony their son had been seriously ill as a\nchild once when waiting for a jury to consider their verdict at the\n\n\foutbreak of war waiting to hear the irrevocable words over the\nwireless on the eve of Antonys departure after embarkation leave.",

    "She had said Is it \n\nHe had bowed his head then crossed and put the telegram into her\noutstretched hand.",
    "They had stood there quite silently for a while.",
    "Then Jeremy had said\nI wish I could help you my dear.",
    "And she had answered her voice steady her tears unshed conscious\nonly of the terrible emptiness and aching Its just as bad for you.",
    "He had patted her shoulder.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Yes... Then he had moved towards the door walking\na little awry yet stiffly suddenly an old man... saying as he did so\nTheres nothing to be said  nothing to be said...\n\nShe had been grateful to him passionately grateful for understanding\nso well and had been torn with pity for him seeing him suddenly turn\ninto an old man.",
    "With the loss of her boy something had hardened in\nher  some ordinary common kindness had dried up.",
    "She was more\n\n\fefficient more energetic than ever  people became sometimes a little\nafraid of her ruthless common sense...\n\nJeremy Cloades finger moved along his upper lip again  irresolutely\nsearching.",
    "And crisply across the room Frances spoke.",
    "Is anything the matter Jeremy\n\nHe started.",
    "His coffee cup almost slipped from his hand.",
    "He recovered\nhimself put it firmly down on the tray.",
    "Then he looked across at her.",
    "What do you mean Frances\n\nIm asking you if anything is the matter\n\nWhat should be the matter\n\nIt would be foolish to guess.",
    "I would rather you told me.",
    "She spoke without emotion in a businesslike way.",
    "He said unconvincingly\n\nThere is nothing the matter \n\nShe did not answer.",
    "She merely waited inquiringly.",
    "His denial it\nseemed she put aside as negligible.",
    "He looked at her uncertainly.",
    "And just for a moment the imperturbable mask of his grey face slipped\nand she caught a glimpse of such turbulent agony that she almost\nexclaimed aloud.",
    "It was only for a moment but she didnt doubt what\nshe had seen.",
    "She said quietly and unemotionally\n\nI think you had better tell me \n\nHe sighed  a deep unhappy sigh.",
    "You will have to know of course he said sooner or later.",
    "And he added what was to her a very astonishing phrase.",
    "Im afraid youve made a bad bargain Frances.",
    "She went right past an implication she did not understand to attack\nhard facts.",
    "What is it she said money\n\nShe did not know why she put money first.",
    "There had been no special\nsigns of financial stringency other than were natural to the times.",
    "They\nwere shortstaffed at the office with more business than they could\ncope with but that was the same everywhere and in the last month\nthey had got back some of their people released from the Army.",
    "It\nmight just as easily have been illness that he was concealing  his\ncolour had been bad lately and he had been overworked and\n\n\fovertired.",
    "But nevertheless Francess instinct went towards money\nand it seemed she was right.",
    "Her husband nodded.",
    "I see.",
    "She was silent a moment thinking.",
    "She herself did not really care\nabout money at all  but she knew that Jeremy was quite incapable of\nrealising that.",
    "Money meant to him a foursquare world  stability obligations  a definite place and status in life.",
    "Money to her was a toy tossed into ones lap to play with.",
    "She had been\nborn and bred in an atmosphere of financial instability.",
    "There had been\nwonderful times when the horses had done what was expected of\nthem.",
    "There had been difficult times when the tradesmen wouldnt give\ncredit and Lord Edward had been forced to ignominious straits to\navoid the bailiffs on the frontdoor step.",
    "Once they had lived on dry\nbread for a week and sent all the servants away.",
    "They had had the\nbailiffs in the house for three weeks once when Frances was a child.",
    "She had found the bum in question very agreeable to play with and full\nof stories of his own little girl.",
    "If one had no money one simply scrounged or went abroad or lived on\nones friends and relations for a bit.",
    "Or somebody tided you over with a\nloan...",
    "But looking across at her husband Frances realised that in the Cloade\nworld you didnt do that kind of thing.",
    "You didnt beg or borrow or live\n\n\fon other people.",
    "And conversely you didnt expect them to beg or\nborrow or live off you\n\nFrances felt terribly sorry for Jeremy and a little guilty about being so\nunperturbed herself.",
    "She took refuge in practicality.",
    "Shall we have to sell up everything Is the firm going smash\n\nJeremy Cloade winced and she realised she had been too matteroffact.",
    "My dear she said gently do tell me.",
    "I cant go on guessing.",
    "Cloade said stiffly We went through rather a bad crisis two years\nago.",
    "Young Williams you remember absconded.",
    "We had some\ndifficulty getting straight again.",
    "Then there were certain complications\narising out of the position in the Far East after Singapore \n\nShe interrupted him.",
    "Never mind the whys  they are so unimportant.",
    "You were in a jam.",
    "And you havent been able to snap out of it\n\nHe said I relied on Gordon.",
    "Gordon would have put things straight.",
    "She gave a quick impatient sigh.",
    "Of course.",
    "I dont want to blame the poor man  after all its only\nhuman nature to lose your head about a pretty woman.",
    "And why on\nearth shouldnt he marry again if he wanted to But it was unfortunate\n\n\fhis being killed in that air raid before hed settled anything or made a\nproper will or adjusted his affairs.",
    "The truth is that one never believes\nfor a minute no matter what danger youre in that you yourself are\ngoing to be killed.",
    "The bomb is always going to hit the other person\n\nApart from his loss and I was very fond of Gordon  and proud of him\ntoo said Gordon Cloades elder brother his death was a\ncatastrophe for me.",
    "It came at a moment \n\nHe stopped.",
    "Shall we be bankrupt Frances asked with intelligent interest.",
    "Jeremy Cloade looked at her almost despairingly.",
    "Though she did not\nrealise it he could have coped much better with tears and alarm.",
    "This\ncool detached practical interest defeated him utterly.",
    "He said harshly Its a good deal worse than that...",
    "He watched her as she sat quite still thinking over that.",
    "He said to\nhimself In another minute I shall have to tell her.",
    "Shell know what I\nam...",
    "Shell have to know.",
    "Perhaps she wont believe it at first.",
    "Frances Cloade sighed and sat up straight in her big armchair.",
    "I see she said.",
    "Embezzlement.",
    "Or if that isnt the right word that\nkind of thing... Like young Williams.",
    "Yes but this time  you dont understand  Im responsible.",
    "Ive used\ntrust funds that were committed to my charge.",
    "So far Ive covered my\ntracks \n\nBut now its all going to come out\n\nUnless I can get the necessary money  quickly.",
    "The shame he felt was the worst he had known in his life.",
    "How would\nshe take it\n\nAt the moment she was taking it very calmly.",
    "But then he thought\nFrances would never make a scene.",
    "Never reproach or upbraid.",
    "Her hand to her cheek she was frowning.",
    "Its so stupid she said that I havent got any money of my own at\nall...",
    "He said stiffly There is your marriage settlement but \n\nShe said absently But I suppose thats gone too.",
    "He was silent.",
    "Then he said with difficulty in his dry voice Im sorry\nFrances.",
    "More sorry than I can say.",
    "You made a bad bargain.",
    "She looked up sharply.",
    "You said that before.",
    "What do you mean by that\n\n\fJeremy said stiffly\n\nWhen you were good enough to marry me you had the right to expect\n well integrity  and a life free from sordid anxieties.",
    "She was looking at him with complete astonishment.",
    "Really Jeremy What on earth do you think I married you for\n\nHe smiled slightly.",
    "You have always been a most loyal and devoted wife my dear.",
    "But I\ncan hardly natter myself that you would have accepted me in  er different circumstances.",
    "She stared at him and suddenly burst out laughing.",
    "You funny old stick What a wonderful novelettish mind you must have\nbehind that legal facade Do you really think that I married you as the\nprice of saving Father from the wolves  or the Stewards of the Jockey\nClub et cetera\n\nYou were very fond of your father Frances.",
    "I was devoted to Daddy He was terribly attractive and the greatest\nfun to live with But I always knew he was a bad hat.",
    "And if you think\nthat Id sell myself to the family solicitor in order to save him from\ngetting what was always coming to him then youve never understood\nthe first thing about me.",
    "Never\n\n\fShe stared at him.",
    "Extraordinary she thought to have been married to\nsomeone for over twenty years and not have known what was going on\nin their minds.",
    "But how could one know when it was a mind so different\nfrom ones own A romantic mind of course well camouflaged but\nessentially romantic.",
    "She thought All those old Stanley Weymans in\nhis bedroom.",
    "I might have known from them The poor idiotic darling\n\nAloud she said\n\nI married you because I was in love with you of course.",
    "In love with me But what could you see in me\n\nIf you ask me that Jeremy I really dont know.",
    "You were such a\nchange so different from all Fathers crowd.",
    "You never talked about\nhorses for one thing.",
    "Youve no idea how sick I was of horses  and\nwhat the odds were likely to be for the Newmarket Cup You came to\ndinner one night  do you remember  and I sat next to you and asked\nyou what bimetallism was and you told me  really told me It took the\nwhole of dinner  six courses  we were in funds at the moment and had\na French chef\n\nIt must have been extremely boring said Jeremy.",
    "It was fascinating Nobody had ever treated me seriously before.",
    "And\nyou were so polite and yet never seemed to look at me or think I was\nnice or good looking or anything.",
    "It put me on my mettle.",
    "I swore Id\nmake you notice me.",
    "Jeremy Cloade said grimly I noticed you all right.",
    "I went home that\nevening and didnt sleep a wink.",
    "You had a blue dress with\ncornflowers...",
    "There was silence for a moment or two then Jeremy cleared his\nthroat.",
    "Er  all that is a long time ago...\n\nShe came quickly to the rescue of his embarrassment.",
    "And were now a middleaged married couple in difficulties looking\nfor the best way out.",
    "After what youve just told me Frances it makes it a thousand times\nworse that this  this disgrace \n\nShe interrupted him.",
    "Let us please get things clear.",
    "You are being apologetic because\nyouve fallen foul of the law.",
    "You may be prosecuted  go to prison.",

    "But he went to fight\nand got a posthumous V.C.",
    "for complete bravery and devotion to his\nmen and superhuman endurance.",
    "What Im trying to say is people are\nlike that  not quite bad or quite good.",
    "I dont suppose Im particularly\n\n\fstraight myself  I have been because there hasnt been any temptation\nto be otherwise.",
    "But what I have got is plenty of courage and  she\nsmiled at him Im loyal\n\nMy dear He got up and came over to her.",
    "He stooped and put his lips\nto her hair.",
    "And now said Lord Edward Trentons daughter smiling up at him\nwhat are we going to do Raise money somehow\n\nJeremys face stiffened.",
    "I dont see how.",
    "A mortgage on this house.",
    "Oh I see she was quick thats been\ndone.",

    "She might respond.",
    "Her husband said warningly\n\nThere must be no hint of  er  real urgency.",

    "Presently he said Thinking out something\n\nHis voice was quite pleasant slightly amused but she felt consciencestricken.",
    "He might think that she was going out of her way to be illmannered.",
    "She said Im sorry.",

    "And it doesnt seem\nto do much good either.",
    "It is usually more practical to wish to do harm.",
    "Weve thought up one\nor two rather practical gadgets in that line during the last few years including that piece de resistance the Atom Bomb.",

    "Nowadays well  He\nshrugged his shoulders.",
    "With all the ill will in the world you and your\nfamily cant do much about Rosaleen and myself can you\n\nLynns head went back with a jerk.",
    "Suddenly she was enjoying herself.",
    "Its a little late in the day for that she said politely.",
    "David Hunter laughed.",
    "He too sounded as though he were enjoying\nhimself.",
    "Meaning weve got away with the booty Yes were sitting pretty all\nright.",
    "And you get a kick out of it\n\nOut of having a lot of money Ill say we do.",
    "I didnt mean only the money.",
    "I meant out of us.",
    "Out of having scored off you Well perhaps.",
    "Youd all have been\npretty smug and complacent about the old boys cash.",
    "Looked upon it\nas practically in your pockets already.",
    "Lynn said\n\nYou must remember that wed been taught to think so for years.",
    "Taught not to save not to think of the future  encouraged to go ahead\nwith all sorts of schemes and projects.",
    "Rowley she thought Rowley and the farm.",
    "Only one thing in fact that you hadnt learnt said David pleasantly.",
    "Whats that\n\nThat nothings safe.",
    "Lynn cried Aunt Katherine leaning forward from the head of the\ntable one of Mrs Lesters controls is a fourth dynasty priest.",
    "Hes told\nus such wonderful things.",
    "You and I Lynn must have a long talk.",
    "Egypt I feel must have affected you physically.",
    "Dr Cloade said sharply\n\nLynns had better things to do than play about with all this\nsuperstitious tomfoolery.",
    "You are so biased Lionel said his wife.",
    "Lynn smiled at her aunt  then sat silent with the refrain of the words\nDavid had spoken swimming in her brain.",
    "Nothings safe...",
    "There were people who lived in such a world  people to whom\neverything was dangerous.",
    "David Hunter was such a person...",
    "It was\nnot the world that Lynn had been brought up in  but it was a world that\nheld attractions for her nevertheless.",
    "David said presently in the same low amused voice\n\nAre we still on speaking terms\n\nOh yes.",
    "Good.",
    "And do you still grudge Rosaleen and myself our illgotten\naccess to wealth\n\nYes said Lynn with spirit.",
    "Splendid.",
    "What are you going to do about it\n\nBuy some wax and practise black magic\n\nHe laughed.",
    "Oh no you wont do that.",
    "You arent one of those who rely on old outmoded methods.",
    "Your methods will be modern and probably very\nefficient.",
    "But you wont win.",
    "What makes you think there is going to be a fight Havent we all\naccepted the inevitable\n\nYou all behave beautifully.",
    "It is very amusing.",
    "Why said Lynn in a low tone do you hate us\n\nSomething flickered in those dark unfathomable eyes.",
    "I couldnt possibly make you understand.",
    "I think you could said Lynn.",
    "David was silent for a moment or two then he asked in a light\nconversational tone\n\nWhy are you going to marry Rowley Cloade Hes an oaf.",
    "She said sharply\n\nYou know nothing about it  or about him.",
    "You couldnt begin to know\n\nWithout any air of changing the conversation David asked\n\nWhat do you think of Rosaleen\n\nShes very lovely.",
    "What else\n\nShe doesnt seem to be enjoying herself.",
    "Quite right said David Rosaleens rather stupid.",
    "Shes scared.",
    "She\nalways has been rather scared.",
    "She drifts into things and then doesnt\nknow what its all about.",
    "Shall I tell you about Rosaleen\n\nIf you like said Lynn politely.",
    "I do like.",
    "She started by being stagestruck and drifted on to the\nstage.",
    "She wasnt any good of course.",
    "She got into a thirdrate touring\ncompany that was going out to South Africa.",
    "She liked the sound of\nSouth Africa.",
    "The company got stranded in Cape Town.",
    "Then she\ndrifted into marriage with a Government official from Nigeria.",
    "She\ndidnt like Nigeria  and I dont think she liked her husband much.",
    "If\nhed been a hearty sort of fellow who drank and beat her it would have\nbeen all right.",
    "But he was rather an intellectual man who kept a large\nlibrary in the wilds and who liked to talk metaphysics.",
    "So she drifted\nback to Cape Town again.",
    "The fellow behaved very well and gave her\nan adequate allowance.",
    "He might have given her a divorce but again\nhe might not for he was a Catholic but anyway he rather fortunately\ndied of fever and Rosaleen got a small pension.",
    "Then the war started\nand she drifted on to a boat for South America.",
    "She didnt like South\nAmerica very much so she drifted on to another boat and there she\nmet Gordon Cloade and told him all about her sad life.",
    "So they got\nmarried in New York and lived happily for a fortnight and a little later\nhe was killed by a bomb and she was left a large house a lot of\nexpensive jewellery and an immense income.",
    "Its nice that the story has such a happy ending said Lynn.",
    "Yes said David Hunter.",
    "Possessing no intellect at all Rosaleen has\nalways been a lucky girl  which is just as well.",
    "Gordon Cloade was a\nstrong old man.",
    "He was sixtytwo.",
    "He might easily have lived for twenty\nyears.",
    "He might have lived even longer.",
    "That wouldnt have been much\nfun for Rosaleen would it She was twentyfour when she married him.",
    "Shes only twentysix now.",
    "She looks even younger said Lynn.",
    "David looked across the table.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade was crumbling her\nbread.",
    "She looked like a nervous child.",
    "Yes he said thoughtfully.",
    "She does.",
    "Complete absence of thought I\nsuppose.",
    "Poor thing said Lynn suddenly.",
    "David frowned.",
    "Why the pity he said sharply.",
    "Ill look after Rosaleen.",
    "I expect you will.",
    "He scowled.",
    "Any one who tries to do down Rosaleen has got me to deal with And I\nknow a good many ways of making war  some of them not strictly\northodox.",
    "Am I going to hear your life history now asked Lynn coldly.",
    "A very abridged edition.",
    "He smiled.",
    "When the war broke out I saw\nno reason why I should fight for England.",
    "Im Irish.",
    "But like all the Irish\nI like fighting.",
    "The Commandos had an irresistible fascination for me.",
    "I\nhad some fun but unfortunately I got knocked out with a bad leg\nwound.",
    "Then I went to Canada and did a job of training fellows there.",
    "I\nwas at a loose end when I got Rosaleens wire from New York saying\nshe was getting married She didnt actually announce that there\n\n\fwould be pickings but Im quite sharp at reading between the lines.",
    "I\nflew there tacked myself on to the happy pair and came back with\nthem to London.",
    "And now  he smiled insolently at her  Home is the\nsailor home from the sea.",
    "Thats you And the Hunter home from the\nHill.",
    "Whats the matter\n\nNothing said Lynn.",
    "She got up with the others.",
    "As they went into the drawingroom\nRowley said to her You seemed to be getting on quite well with David\nHunter.",
    "What were you talking about\n\nNothing particular said Lynn.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nDavid when are we going back to London When are we going to\nAmerica\n\nAcross the breakfast table David Hunter gave Rosaleen a quick\nsurprised glance.",
    "Theres no hurry is there Whats wrong with this place\n\nHe gave a swift appreciative glance round the room where they were\nbreakfasting.",
    "Furrowbank was built on the side of a hill and from the windows one\nhad an unbroken panorama of sleepy English countryside.",
    "On the\n\n\fslope of the lawn thousands of daffodils had been planted.",
    "They were\nnearly over now but a sheet of golden bloom still remained.",
    "Crumbling the toast on her plate Rosaleen murmured\n\nYou said wed go to America  soon.",
    "As soon as it could be managed.",
    "Yes  but actually it isnt managed so easily.",
    "Theres priority.",
    "Neither\nyou nor I have any business reasons to put forward.",
    "Things are always\ndifficult after a war.",
    "He felt faintly irritated with himself as he spoke.",
    "The reasons he\nadvanced though genuine enough had the sound of excuses.",
    "He\nwondered if they sounded that way to the girl who sat opposite him.",
    "And why was she suddenly so keen to go to America\n\nRosaleen murmured You said wed only be here for a short time.",
    "You\ndidnt say we were going to live here.",
    "Whats wrong with Warmsley Vale  and Furrowbank Come now\n\nNothing.",
    "Its them  all of them\n\nThe Cloades\n\nYes.",
    "Thats just what I get a kick out of said David.",
    "I like seeing their\nsmug faces eaten up with envy and malice.",
    "Dont grudge me my fun\nRosaleen.",
    "She said in a low troubled voice\n\nI wish you didnt feel like that.",
    "I dont like it.",
    "Have some spirit girl.",
    "Weve been pushed around enough you and I.",

    "They havent done me any harm.",
    "But theyd like to babyface.",
    "Theyd like to.",
    "He laughed recklessly.",
    "If\nthey werent so careful of their own skins youd be found with a knife\nin your back one fine morning.",
    "She shivered.",
    "Dont say such dreadful things.",
    "Well  perhaps not a knife.",
    "Strychnine in the soup.",
    "She stared at him her mouth tremulous.",
    "Youre joking...",
    "He became serious again.",
    "Dont worry Rosaleen.",
    "Ill look after you.",
    "Theyve got me to deal with.",
    "She said stumbling over the words If its true what you say  about\ntheir hating us  hating me  why dont we go to London Wed be safe\nthere  away from them all.",
    "The countrys good for you my girl.",
    "You know it makes you ill being in\nLondon.",

    "Dont remember.",
    "The\ndoctor said country air and a country life for a long time to come.",
    "Thats why I want to keep you away from London.",
    "Is that really why Is it David I thought  perhaps \n\nWhat did you think\n\nRosaleen said slowly\n\nI thought perhaps it was because of her you wanted to be here...",

    "And youve seen her since havent you\n\nI met her near the farm the other morning when I was out riding.",
    "And youll meet her again.",
    "Of course Ill always be meeting her This is a tiny place.",
    "You cant go\ntwo steps without falling over a Cloade.",
    "But if you think Ive fallen for\nLynn Marchmont youre wrong.",
    "Shes a proud stuckup unpleasant girl\nwithout a civil tongue in her head.",
    "I wish old Rowley joy of her.",
    "No\nRosaleen my girl shes not my type.",
    "She said doubtfully Are you sure David\n\nOf course Im sure.",
    "She said halftimidly\n\nI know you dont like my laying out the cards...",
    "But they come true\nthey do indeed.",
    "There was a girl bringing trouble and sorrow  a girl\nwould come from over the sea.",
    "There was a dark stranger too coming\ninto our lives and bringing danger with him.",
    "There was the death card\nand \n\nYou and your dark strangers David laughed.",
    "What a mass of\nsuperstition you are.",
    "Dont have any dealings with a dark stranger\nthats my advice to you.",
    "He strolled out of the house laughing but when he was away from the\nhouse his face clouded over and he frowned to himself murmuring\n\nBad luck to you Lynn.",
    "Coming home from abroad and upsetting the\napple cart.",
    "For he realised that at this very moment he was deliberately making a\ncourse on which he might hope to meet the girl he had just\napostrophised so savagely.",
    "Rosaleen watched him stroll away across the garden and out through\nthe small gate that gave on to a public footpath across the fields.",
    "Then\nshe went up to her bedroom and looked through the clothes in her\n\n\fwardrobe.",
    "She always enjoyed touching and feeling her new mink\ncoat.",
    "To think she should own a coat like that  she could never quite\nget over the wonder of it.",
    "She was in her bedroom when the\nparlourmaid came up to tell her that Mrs Marchmont had called.",
    "Adela was sitting in the drawingroom with her lips set tightly together\nand her heart beating at twice its usual speed.",
    "She had been steeling\nherself for several days to make an appeal to Rosaleen but true to her\nnature had procrastinated.",
    "She had also been bewildered by finding that Lynns attitude had\nunaccountably changed and that she was now rigidly opposed to her\nmother seeking relief from her anxieties by asking Gordons widow for\na loan.",
    "However another letter from the Bank Manager that morning had\ndriven Mrs Marchmont into positive action.",
    "She could delay no longer.",
    "Lynn had gone out early and Mrs Marchmont had caught sight of\nDavid Hunter walking along the footpath  so the coast was clear.",
    "She\nparticularly wanted to get Rosaleen alone without David rightly\njudging that Rosaleen alone would be a far easier proposition.",
    "Nevertheless she felt dreadfully nervous as she waited in the sunny\ndrawingroom though she felt slightly better when Rosaleen came in\nwith what Mrs Marchmont always thought of as her halfwitted look\nmore than usually marked.",
    "I wonder thought Adela to herself if the blast did it or if she was\nalways like that\n\n\fRosaleen stammered.",
    "Oh ggood morning.",
    "Is there anything Do sit down.",
    "Such a lovely morning said Mrs Marchmont brightly.",
    "All my early\ntulips are out.",
    "Are yours\n\nThe girl stared at her vacantly.",
    "I dont know.",
    "What was one to do thought Adela with someone who didnt talk\ngardening or dogs  those standbyes of rural conversation.",
    "Aloud she said unable to help the tinge of acidity that crept into her\ntone\n\nOf course you have so many gardeners  they attend to all that.",
    "I believe were shorthanded.",
    "Old Mullard wants two more men he\nsays.",
    "But there seems a terrible shortage still of labour.",
    "The words came out with a kind of glib parrotlike delivery  rather like\na child who repeats what it has heard a grownup person say.",
    "Yes she was like a child.",
    "Was that Adela wondered her charm Was\nthat what had attracted that hardheaded shrewd business man\nGordon Cloade and blinded him to her stupidity and her lack of\nbreeding After all it couldnt only be looks.",
    "Plenty of goodlooking\nwomen had angled unsuccessfully to attract him.",
    "But childishness to a man of sixtytwo might be an attraction.",
    "Was it\ncould it be real  or was it a pose  a pose that had paid and so had\nbecome second nature\n\nRosaleen was saying Davids out Im afraid... and the words\nrecalled Mrs Marchmont to herself.",
    "David might return.",
    "Now was her\nchance and she must not neglect it.",
    "The words stuck in her throat but\nshe got them out.",
    "I wonder  if you would help me\n\nHelp you\n\nRosaleen looked surprised uncomprehending.",
    "I  things are very difficult  you see Gordons death has made a great\ndifference to us all.",
    "You silly idiot she thought.",
    "Must you go on gaping at me like that\nYou know what I mean You must know what I mean.",
    "After all youve\nbeen poor yourself...\n\nShe hated Rosaleen at that moment.",
    "Hated her because she Adela\nMarchmont was sitting here whining for money.",
    "She thought I cant\ndo it  I cant do it after all.",
    "In one brief instant all the long hours of thought and worry and vague\nplanning flashed again across her brain.",
    "Sell the house  But move where There werent any small houses on\nthe market  certainly not any cheap houses.",
    "Take paying guests But you couldnt get staff  and she simply couldnt  she just couldnt\ndeal with all the cooking and housework involved.",
    "If Lynn helped  but\nLynn was going to marry Rowley.",
    "Live with Rowley and Lynn herself\nNo shed never do that Get a job.",
    "What job Who wanted an\nuntrained elderly tiredout woman\n\nShe heard her voice belligerent because she despised herself.",
    "I mean money she said.",
    "Money said Rosaleen.",
    "She sounded ingenuously surprised as though money was the last\nthing she expected to be mentioned.",
    "Adela went on doggedly tumbling the words out\n\nIm overdrawn at the bank and I owe bills  repairs to the house  and\nthe rates havent been paid yet.",
    "You see everythings halved  my\nincome I mean.",
    "I suppose its taxation.",
    "Gordon you see used to help.",
    "With the house I mean.",
    "He did all the repairs and the roof and painting\nand things like that.",
    "And an allowance as well.",
    "He paid it into the bank\nevery quarter.",
    "He always said not to worry and of course I never did.",
    "I\nmean it was all right when he was alive but now \n\nShe stopped.",
    "She was ashamed  but at the same time relieved.",
    "After\nall the worst was over.",
    "If the girl refused she refused and that was\nthat.",
    "Rosaleen was looking very uncomfortable.",
    "Oh dear she said.",
    "I didnt know.",
    "I never thought...",
    "I  well of\ncourse Ill ask David...\n\nGrimly gripping the sides of her chair Adela said desperately\n\nCouldnt you give me a cheque  now...",
    "Yes  yes I suppose I could.",
    "Rosaleen looking startled got up went\nto the desk.",
    "She hunted in various pigeonholes and finally produced a\nchequebook.",
    "Shall I  how much\n\nWould  would five hundred pounds \n\nAdela broke off.",
    "Five hundred pounds Rosaleen wrote obediently.",
    "A load slipped off Adelas back.",
    "After all it had been easy She was\ndismayed as it occurred to her that it was less gratitude that she felt\nthan a faint scorn for the easiness of her victory Rosaleen was surely\nstrangely simple.",
    "The girl rose from the writingdesk and came across to her.",
    "She held\nout the cheque awkwardly.",
    "The embarrassment seemed now entirely\non her side.",
    "I hope this is all right.",
    "Im really so sorry \n\n\fAdela took the cheque.",
    "The unformed childish hand straggled across\nthe pink paper.",
    "Mrs Marchmont.",
    "Five hundred pounds.",
    "Rosaleen\nCloade.",
    "Its very good of you Rosaleen.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Oh please  I mean  I ought to have thought \n\nVery good of you my dear.",
    "With the cheque in her handbag Adela Marchmont felt a different\nwoman.",
    "The girl had really been very sweet about it.",
    "It would be\nembarrassing to prolong the interview.",
    "She said goodbye and\ndeparted.",
    "She passed David in the drive said Good morning pleasantly and\nhurried on.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nWhat was the Marchmont woman doing here demanded David as\nsoon as he got in.",
    "Oh David.",
    "She wanted money dreadfully badly.",
    "Id never thought \n\nAnd you gave it her I suppose.",
    "He looked at her in halfhumorous despair.",
    "Youre not to be trusted alone Rosaleen.",
    "Oh David I couldnt refuse.",
    "After all \n\nAfter all  what How much\n\nIn a small voice Rosaleen murmured Five hundred pounds.",
    "To her relief David laughed.",
    "A mere fleabite\n\nOh David its a lot of money.",
    "Not to us nowadays Rosaleen.",
    "You never really seem to grasp that\nyoure a very rich woman.",
    "All the same if she asked five hundred shed\nhave gone away perfectly satisfied with twofifty.",
    "You must learn the\nlanguage of borrowing\n\nShe murmured Im sorry David.",
    "My dear girl After all its your money.",
    "It isnt.",
    "Not really.",
    "Now dont begin that all over again.",
    "Gordon Cloade died before he\nhad time to make a will.",
    "Thats whats called the luck of the game.",
    "We\nwin you and I.",
    "The others  lose.",
    "It doesnt seem  right.",
    "Come now my lovely sister Rosaleen arent you enjoying all this A\nbig house servants  jewellery Isnt it a dream come true Isnt it\nGlory be to God sometimes I think Ill wake up and find it is a dream.",
    "She laughed with him and watching her narrowly he was satisfied.",
    "He\nknew how to deal with his Rosaleen.",
    "It was inconvenient he thought\nthat she should have a conscience but there it was.",
    "Its quite true David it is like a dream  or like something on the\nPictures.",
    "I do enjoy it all.",
    "I do really.",
    "But what we have we hold he warned her.",
    "No more gifts to the\nCloades Rosaleen.",
    "Every one of them has got far more money than\neither you or I ever had.",
    "Yes I suppose thats true.",
    "Where was Lynn this morning he asked.",
    "I think shed gone to Long Willows.",
    "To Long Willows  to see Rowley  the oaf  the clodhopper His good\nhumour vanished.",
    "Set on marrying the fellow was she\n\nMoodily he strolled out of the house up through massed azaleas and\nout through the small gate on the top of the hill.",
    "From there the\nfootpath dipped down the hill and past Rowleys farm.",
    "As David stood there he saw Lynn Marchmont coming up from the\nfarm.",
    "He hesitated for a minute then set his jaw pugnaciously and\nstrolled down the hill to meet her.",
    "They met by a stile just halfway up\nthe hill.",
    "Good morning said David.",
    "Whens the wedding\n\nYouve asked that before she retorted.",
    "You know well enough.",
    "Its\nin June.",
    "Youre going through with it\n\nI dont know what you mean David.",
    "Oh yes you do.",
    "He gave a contemptuous laugh.",
    "Rowley.",
    "Whats\nRowley\n\nA better man than you  touch him if you dare she said lightly.",
    "Ive no doubt hes a better man than me  but I do dare.",
    "Id dare\nanything for you Lynn.",
    "She was silent for a moment or two.",
    "She said at last\n\nWhat you dont understand is that I love Rowley.",
    "I wonder.",
    "She said vehemently\n\n\fI do I tell you.",
    "I do.",
    "David looked at her searchingly.",
    "We all see pictures of ourselves  of ourselves as we want to be.",
    "You\nsee yourself in love with Rowley settling down with Rowley living here\ncontented with Rowley never wanting to get away.",
    "But thats not the\nreal you is it Lynn\n\nOh what is the real me Whats the real you if it comes to that What\ndo you want\n\nId have said I wanted safety peace after storm ease after troubled\nseas.",
    "But I dont know.",
    "Sometimes I suspect Lynn that both you and I\nwant  trouble.",
    "He added moodily I wish youd never turned up here.",
    "I was remarkably happy until you came.",
    "Arent you happy now\n\nHe looked at her.",
    "She felt excitement rising in her.",
    "Her breath became\nfaster.",
    "Never had she felt so strongly Davids queer moody attraction.",
    "He shot out a hand grasped her shoulder swung her round...\n\nThen as suddenly she felt his grasp slacken.",
    "He was staring over her\nshoulder up the hill.",
    "She twisted her head to see what it was that had\ncaught his attention.",
    "A woman was just going through the small gate above Furrowback.",
    "David said sharply Whos that\n\n\fLynn said\n\nIt looks like Frances.",
    "Frances He frowned.",
    "What does Frances want\n\nMy dear Lynn Only those who want something drop in to see\nRosaleen.",
    "Your mother has already dropped in this morning.",
    "Mother Lynn drew back.",
    "She frowned.",
    "What did she want\n\nDont you know Money\n\nMoney Lynn stiffened.",
    "She got it all right said David.",
    "He was smiling now the cool cruel\nsmile that flitted his face so well.",
    "They had been near a moment or two ago now they were miles apart\ndivided by a sharp antagonism.",
    "Lynn cried out Oh no no no\n\nHe mimicked her.",
    "Yes yes yes\n\nI dont believe it How much\n\n\fFive hundred pounds.",
    "She drew her breath in sharply.",
    "David said musingly\n\nI wonder how much Frances is going to ask for Really its hardly safe\nto leave Rosaleen alone for five minutes The poor girl doesnt know\nhow to say no.",
    "Have there been  who else\n\nDavid smiled mockingly.",
    "Aunt Kathie had incurred certain debts  oh nothing much a mere\ntwo hundred and fifty covered them  but she was afraid it might get to\nthe doctors ears Since they had been occasioned by payments to\nmediums he might not have been sympathetic.",
    "She didnt know of\ncourse added David that the doctor himself had applied for a loan.",
    "Lynn said in a low voice What you must think of us  what you must\nthink of us\n\nThen taking him by surprise she turned and ran helterskelter down\nthe hill to the farm.",
    "He frowned as he watched her go.",
    "She had gone to Rowley flown\nthere as a homing pigeon flies and the fact disturbed him more than\nhe cared to acknowledge.",
    "He looked up the hill again and frowned.",
    "No Frances he said under his breath.",
    "I think not.",
    "Youve chosen a\nbad day and he strode purposefully up the hill.",
    "He went through the gate and down through the azaleas  crossed the\nlawn and came quietly in through the window of the drawingroom just\nas Frances Cloade was saying\n\n I wish I could make it all clearer.",
    "But you see Rosaleen it really is\nfrightfully difficult to explain \n\nA voice from behind her said\n\nIs it\n\nFrances Cloade turned sharply.",
    "Unlike Adela Marchmont she had not\ndeliberately tried to find Rosaleen alone.",
    "The sum needed was\nsufficiently large to make it unlikely that Rosaleen would hand it over\nwithout consulting her brother.",
    "Actually Frances would far rather have discussed the matter with\nDavid and Rosaleen together than have David feel that she had tried\nto get money out of Rosaleen during his absence from the house.",
    "She had not heard him come through the window absorbed as she\nwas in the presentation of a plausible case.",
    "The interruption startled\nher and she realised also that David Hunter was for some reason in a\nparticularly ugly mood.",
    "Oh David she said easily Im glad youve come.",
    "Ive just been\ntelling Rosaleen.",
    "Gordons death has left Jeremy in no end of a hole\nand Im wondering if she could possibly come to the rescue.",
    "Its like\nthis \n\nHer tongue flowed on swiftly  the large sum involved  Gordons\nbacking  promised verbally  Government restrictions  mortgages \n\nA certain admiration stirred in the darkness of Davids mind.",
    "What a\ndamned good liar the woman was Plausible the whole story.",
    "But not\nthe truth.",
    "No hed take his oath on that.",
    "Not the truth What he\nwondered was the truth Jeremy been getting himself into Queer\nStreet It must be something pretty desperate if he was allowing\nFrances to come and try this stunt.",
    "She was a proud woman too \n\nHe said Ten thousand\n\nRosaleen murmured in an awed voice\n\nThats a lot of money.",
    "Frances said swiftly\n\nOh I know it is.",
    "I wouldnt come to you if it wasnt such a difficult sum\nto raise.",
    "But Jeremy would never have gone into the deal if it hadnt\nbeen for Gordons backing.",
    "Its so dreadfully unfortunate that Gordon\nshould have died so suddenly \n\n\fLeaving you all out in the cold Davids voice was unpleasant.",
    "After\na sheltered life under his wing.",
    "There was a faint flash in Frances eyes as she said\n\nYou put things so picturesquely\n\nRosaleen cant touch the capital you know.",
    "Only the income.",
    "And she\npays about nineteen and six in the pound income tax.",
    "Oh I know.",
    "Taxations dreadful these days.",
    "But it could be managed\ncouldnt it Wed repay \n\nHe interrupted\n\nIt could be managed.",
    "But it wont be\n\nFrances turned swiftly to Rosaleen.",
    "Rosaleen youre such a generous \n\nDavids voice cut across her speech.",
    "What do you Cloades think Rosaleen is  a milk cow All of you at her hinting asking begging.",
    "And behind her back Sneering at her\npatronising her resenting her hating her wishing her dead \n\nThats not true Frances cried.",
    "Isnt it I tell you Im sick of you all Shes sick of you all.",
    "Youll get no\nmoney out of us so you can stop coming and whining for it\nUnderstand\n\nHis face was black with fury.",
    "Frances stood up.",
    "Her face was wooden and expressionless.",
    "She drew\non a washleather glove absently yet with attention as though it was a\nsignificant action.",
    "You make your meaning quite plain David she said.",
    "Rosaleen murmured\n\nIm sorry.",
    "Im really sorry...\n\nFrances paid no attention to her.",
    "Rosaleen might not have been in the\nroom.",
    "She took a step towards the window and paused facing David.",
    "You have said that I resent Rosaleen.",
    "That is not true.",
    "I have not\nresented Rosaleen  but I do resent  you\n\nWhat do you mean\n\nHe scowled at her.",
    "Women must live.",
    "Rosaleen married a very rich man years older than\nherself.",
    "Why not But you You must live on your sister live on the fat\nof the land live softly  on her.",
    "I stand between her and harpies.",
    "They stood looking at each other.",
    "He was aware of her anger and the\nthought flashed across him that Frances Cloade was a dangerous\nenemy one who could be both unscrupulous and reckless.",
    "When she opened her mouth to speak he even felt a moments\napprehension.",
    "But what she said was singularly noncommittal.",
    "I shall remember what you have said David.",
    "Passing him she went out of the window.",
    "He wondered why he felt so strongly that the words had been a threat.",
    "Rosaleen was crying.",
    "Oh David David  you oughtnt to have been saying those things to\nher.",
    "Shes the one of them thats been the nicest to me.",
    "He said furiously Shut up you little fool.",
    "Do you want them to trample\nall over you and bleed you of every penny\n\nBut the money  if  if it isnt rightfully mine \n\nShe quailed before his glance.",
    "I  I didnt mean that David.",
    "I should hope not.",
    "Conscience he thought was the devil\n\nHe hadnt reckoned with the item of Rosaleens conscience.",
    "It was\ngoing to make things awkward in the future.",
    "The future He frowned as he looked at her and let his thoughts race\nahead.",
    "Rosaleens future... His own... Hed always known what he\nwanted... he knew now...",
    "But Rosaleen What future was there for\nRosaleen\n\nAs his face darkened she cried out  suddenly shivering\n\nOh Someones walking over my grave.",
    "He said looking at her curiously\n\nSo you realise it may come to that\n\nWhat do you mean David\n\nI mean that five  six  seven people have every intention to hurry you\ninto your grave before youre due there\n\nYou dont mean  murder  Her voice was horrified.",
    "You think these\npeople would do murder  not nice people like the Cloades.",
    "Im not sure that it isnt just nice people like the Cloades who do do\nmurder.",
    "But they wont succeed in murdering you while Im here to\nlook after you.",
    "Theyd have to get me out of the way first.",
    "But if they did\nget me out of the way  well  look out for yourself\n\nDavid  dont say such awful things.",
    "Listen he gripped her arm.",
    "If ever Im not here look after yourself\nRosaleen.",
    "Life isnt safe remember  its dangerous damned\ndangerous.",
    "And Ive an idea its specially dangerous for you.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nRowley can you let me have five hundred pounds\n\nRowley stared at Lynn.",
    "She stood there out of breath from running\nher face pale her mouth set.",
    "He said soothingly and rather as he would speak to a horse\n\nThere there ease up old girl.",
    "Whats all this about\n\nI want five hundred pounds.",
    "I could do with it myself for that matter.",
    "But Rowley this is serious.",
    "Cant you lend me five hundred pounds\n\nIm overdrawn as it is.",
    "That new tractor \n\n\fYes yes  She pushed aside the farming details.",
    "But you could raise\nmoney somehow  if you had to couldnt you\n\nWhat do you want it for Lynn Are you in some kind of a hole\n\nI want it for him  She jerked her head backwards towards the big\nsquare house on the hill.",
    "Hunter Why on earth \n\nIts Mums.",
    "Shes been borrowing from him.",
    "Shes  shes in a bit of a\njam about money.",
    "Yes I expect she is.",
    "Rowley sounded sympathetic.",
    "Damned hard\nlines on her.",
    "I wish I could help a bit  but I cant.",
    "I cant stand her borrowing money from David\n\nHold hard old girl.",
    "Its Rosaleen who actually has to fork out the cash.",
    "And after all why not\n\nWhy not You say Why not Rowley\n\nI dont see why Rosaleen shouldnt come to the rescue once in a\nwhile.",
    "Old Gordon put us all in a spot by pegging out without a will.",
    "If\nthe position is put clearly to Rosaleen she must see herself that a spot\nof help all round is indicated.",
    "You havent borrowed from her\n\n\fNo  well  thats different.",
    "I cant very well go and ask a woman for\nmoney.",
    "Sort of thing you dont like doing.",
    "Cant you see that I dont like being  being beholden to David\nHunter\n\nBut youre not.",
    "It isnt his money.",
    "Thats just what it is actually.",
    "Rosaleens completely under his\nthumb.",
    "Oh I dare say.",
    "But it isnt his legally.",
    "And you wont you cant  lend me some money\n\nNow look here Lynn  if you were in some real jam  blackmail or\ndebts  I might be able to sell land or stock  but it would be a pretty\ndesperate proceeding.",
    "Im only just keeping my head above water as it\nis.",
    "And what with not knowing what this damned Government is going\nto do next  hampered at every turn  snowed under with forms up to\nmidnight trying to fill them in sometimes  its too much for one man.",
    "Lynn said bitterly\n\nOh I know If only Johnnie hadnt been killed \n\nHe shouted out\n\nLeave Johnnie out of it Dont talk about that\n\n\fShe stared at him astonished.",
    "His face was red and congested.",
    "He\nseemed beside himself with rage.",
    "Lynn turned away and went slowly back to the White House.",
    "Cant you give it back Mums\n\nReally Lynn darling I went straight to the bank with it.",
    "And then I paid\nArthurs and Bodgham and Knebworth.",
    "Knebworth was getting quite\nabusive.",
    "Oh my dear the relief I havent been able to sleep for nights\nand nights.",
    "Really Rosaleen was most understanding and nice about\nit.",
    "Lynn said bitterly\n\nAnd I suppose youll go to her again and again now.",
    "I hope it wont be necessary dear.",
    "I shall try to be very economical\nyou know that.",
    "But of course everything is so expensive nowadays.",
    "And it gets worse and worse.",
    "Yes and we shall get worse and worse.",
    "Going on cadging.",
    "Adela flushed.",
    "I dont think thats a nice way of putting it Lynn.",
    "As I explained to\nRosaleen we had always depended on Gordon.",
    "We shouldnt have.",
    "Thats whats wrong we shouldnt have.",
    "Lynn\nadded Hes right to despise us.",
    "Who despises us\n\nThat odious David Hunter.",
    "Really said Mrs Marchmont with dignity I dont see that it can\nmatter in the least what David Hunter thinks.",
    "Fortunately he wasnt at\nFurrowbank this morning  otherwise I dare say he would have\ninfluenced that girl.",
    "Shes completely under his thumb of course.",
    "Lynn shifted from one foot to the other.",
    "What did you mean Mums when you said  that first morning I was\nhome  If he is her brother\n\nOh that Mrs Marchmont looked slightly embarrassed.",
    "Well theres\nbeen a certain amount of gossip you know.",
    "Lynn merely waited inquiringly.",
    "Mrs Marchmont coughed.",
    "That type of young woman  the adventuress type of course poor\nGordon was completely taken in theyve usually got a  well a young\nman of their own in the background.",
    "Suppose she says to Gordon\nshes got a brother  wires to him in Canada or wherever he was.",
    "This\nman turns up.",
    "How is Gordon to know whether hes her brother or not\nPoor Gordon absolutely infatuated no doubt and believing everything\nshe said.",
    "And so her brother comes with them to England  poor\nGordon quite unsuspecting.",
    "Lynn said fiercely\n\nI dont believe it.",
    "I dont believe it\n\nMrs Marchmont raised her eyebrows.",
    "Really my dear \n\nHes not like that.",
    "And she  she isnt either.",
    "Shes a fool perhaps but\nshes sweet  yes shes really sweet.",
    "Its just peoples foul minds.",
    "I\ndont believe it I tell you.",
    "Mrs Marchmont said with dignity\n\nTheres really no need to shout\n\nChapter 8\n\nIt was a week later that the 5.20 train drew into Warmsley Heath\nStation and a tall bronzed man with a knapsack got out.",
    "On the opposite platform a cluster of golfers were waiting for the up\ntrain.",
    "The tall bearded man with the knapsack gave up his ticket and\npassed out of the station.",
    "He stood uncertainly for a minute or two  then he saw the signpost\nFootpath to Warmsley Vale  and directed his steps that way with brisk\ndetermination.",
    "At Long Willows Rowley Cloade had just finished making himself a cup\nof tea when a shadow falling across the kitchen table made him look\nup.",
    "If for just a moment he thought the girl standing just inside the door\nwas Lynn his disappointment turned to surprise when he saw it was\nRosaleen Cloade.",
    "She was wearing a frock of some peasant material in bright broad\nstripes of orange and green  the artificial simplicity of which had run\ninto more money than Rowley could ever have imagined possible.",
    "Up to now he had always seen her dressed in expensive and somewhat\ntowny clothes which she wore with an artificial air  much he had\nthought as a mannequin might display dresses that did not belong to\nher but to the firm who employed her.",
    "This afternoon in the broad peasant stripes of gay colour he seemed\nto see a new Rosaleen Cloade.",
    "Her Irish origin was more noticeable\nthe dark curling hair and the lovely blue eyes put in with the smutty\nfinger.",
    "Her voice too had a softer Irish sound instead of the careful\nrather mincing tones in which she usually spoke.",
    "Its such a lovely afternoon she said.",
    "So I came for a walk.",
    "She added\n\nDavids gone to London.",
    "She said it almost guiltily then flushed and took a cigarette case out of\nher bag.",
    "She offered one to Rowley who shook his head then looked round for\na match to light Rosaleens cigarette.",
    "But she was flicking\nunsuccessfully at an expensivelooking small gold lighter.",
    "Rowley took\nit from her and with one sharp movement it lit.",
    "As she bent her head\ntowards him to light her cigarette he noticed how long and dark the\nlashes were that lay on her cheek and he thought to himself\n\nOld Gordon knew what he was doing...\n\nRosaleen stepped back a pace and said admiringly\n\nThats a lovely little heifer youve got in the top field.",
    "Astonished by her interest Rowley began to talk to her about the farm.",
    "Her interest surprised him but it was obviously genuine and not put\non and to his surprise he found that she was quite knowledgeable on\nfarm matters.",
    "Buttermaking and dairy produce she spoke of with\nfamiliarity.",
    "Why you might be a farmers wife Rosaleen he said smiling.",
    "The animation went out of her face.",
    "She said\n\nWe had a farm  in Ireland  before I came over here  before \n\n\fBefore you went on the stage\n\nShe said wistfully and a trifle it seemed to him guiltily\n\nIts not so very long ago...",
    "I remember it all very well.",
    "She added with\na flash of spirit I could milk your cows for you Rowley now.",
    "This was quite a new Rosaleen.",
    "Would David Hunter have approved\nthese casual references to a farming past Rowley thought not.",
    "Old\nIrish landed gentry that was the impression David tried to put over.",
    "Rosaleens version he thought was nearer the truth.",
    "Primitive farm\nlife then the lure of the stage the touring company to South Africa\nmarriage  isolation in Central Africa  escape  hiatus  and finally\nmarriage to a millionaire in New York...",
    "Yes Rosaleen Hunter had travelled a long way since milking a Kerry\ncow.",
    "Yet looking at her he found it hard to believe that she had ever\nstarted.",
    "Her face had that innocent slightly halfwitted expression the\nface of one who has no history.",
    "And she looked so young  much\nyounger than her twentysix years.",
    "There was something appealing about her she had the same pathetic\nquality as the little calves he had driven to the butcher that morning.",
    "He looked at her as he had looked at them.",
    "Poor little devils he had\nthought a pity that they had to be killed...\n\nA look of alarm came into Rosaleens eyes.",
    "She asked uneasily What\nare you thinking of Rowley\n\nWould you like to see over the farm and the dairy\n\n\fOh indeed I would.",
    "Amused by her interest he took her all over the farm.",
    "But when he\nfinally suggested making her a cup of tea an alarmed expression\ncame into her eyes.",
    "Oh no  thank you Rowley  Id best be getting home.",
    "She looked\ndown at her watch.",
    "Oh how late it is David will be back by the 5.20\ntrain.",
    "Hell wonder where I am.",
    "I  I must hurry.",
    "She added shyly I\nhave enjoyed myself Rowley.",
    "And that he thought was true.",
    "She had enjoyed herself.",
    "She had been\nable to be natural  to be her own raw unsophisticated self.",
    "She was\nafraid of her brother David that was clear.",
    "David was the brains of the\nfamily.",
    "Well for once shed had an afternoon out  yes that was it an\nafternoon out just like a servant\n\nThe rich Mrs Gordon Cloade\n\nHe smiled grimly as he stood by the gate watching her hurrying up the\nhill towards Furrowbank.",
    "Just before she reached the stile a man\ncame over it  Rowley wondered if it was David but it was a bigger\nheavier man.",
    "Rosaleen drew back to let him pass then skipped lightly\nover the stile her pace accentuating almost to a run.",
    "Yes shed had an afternoon off  and he Rowley had wasted over an\nhour of valuable time Well perhaps it hadnt been wasted.",
    "Rosaleen\nhe thought had seemed to like him.",
    "That might come in useful.",
    "A pretty\n\n\fthing  yes and the calves this morning had been pretty... poor little\ndevils.",
    "Standing there lost in thought he was startled by a voice and raised\nhis head sharply.",
    "A big man in a broad felt hat with a pack slung across his shoulders\nwas standing on the footpath at the other side of the gate.",
    "Is this the way to Warmsley Vale\n\nAs Rowley stared he repeated his question.",
    "With an effort Rowley\nrecalled his thoughts and answered\n\nYes keep right along the path  across that next field.",
    "Turn to the left\nwhen you get to the road and about three minutes takes you right into\nthe village.",
    "In the selfsame words he had answered that particular question\nseveral hundred times.",
    "People took the footpath on leaving the station\nfollowed it up over the hill and lost faith in it as they came down the\nother side and saw no sign of their destination for Blackwell Copse\nmasked Warmsley Vale from sight.",
    "It was tucked away in a hollow\nthere with only the tip of its church tower showing.",
    "The next question was not quite so usual but Rowley answered it\nwithout much thought.",
    "The Stag or the Bells and Motley.",
    "The Stag for choice.",
    "Theyre both\nequally good  or bad.",
    "I should think youd get a room all right.",
    "The question made him look more attentively at his interlocutor.",
    "Nowadays people usually booked a room beforehand at any place they\nwere going to...",
    "The man was tall with a bronzed face a beard and very blue eyes.",
    "He\nwas about forty and not illlooking in a tough and rather daredevil\nstyle.",
    "It was not perhaps a wholly pleasant face.",
    "Come from overseas somewhere thought Rowley.",
    "Was there or was\nthere not a faint Colonial twang in his accent Curious in some way\nthe face was not unfamiliar... Where had he seen that face or a face\nvery like it before\n\nWhilst he was puzzling unsuccessfully over that problem the stranger\nstartled him by asking\n\nCan you tell me if theres a house called Furrowbank near here\n\nRowley answered slowly\n\nWhy yes.",
    "Up there on the hill.",
    "You must have passed close by it  that\nis if youve come along the footpath from the station.",
    "Yes  thats what I did.",
    "He turned staring up the hill.",
    "So that was it that big white newlooking house.",
    "Yes thats the one.",
    "A big place to run said the man.",
    "Must cost a lot to keep up\n\nA devil of a lot thought Rowley.",
    "And our money... A stirring of anger\nmade him forget for the moment where he was...\n\nWith a start he came back to himself to see the stranger staring up the\nhill with a curious speculative look in his eyes.",
    "Who lives there he said.",
    "Is it  a Mrs Cloade\n\nThats right said Rowley.",
    "Mrs Gordon Cloade.",
    "The stranger raised his eyebrows.",
    "He seemed gently amused.",
    "Oh he said Mrs Gordon Cloade.",
    "Very nice for her\n\nThen he gave a short nod.",
    "Thanks pal he said and shifting the pack he carried he strode on\ntowards Warmsley Vale.",
    "Rowley turned slowly back into the farmyard.",
    "His mind was still\npuzzling over something.",
    "Where the devil had he seen that fellow before\n\nAbout ninethirty that night Rowley pushed aside a heap of forms that\nhad been littering the kitchen table and got up.",
    "He looked\n\n\fabsentmindedly at the photograph of Lynn that stood on the\nmantelpiece then frowning he went out of the house.",
    "Ten minutes later he pushed open the door of the Stag Saloon Bar.",
    "Beatrice Lippincott behind the bar counter smiled welcome at him.",
    "Mr Rowley Cloade she thought was a fine figure of a man.",
    "Over a pint of bitter Rowley exchanged the usual observations with the\ncompany present unfavourable comment was made upon the\nGovernment the weather and sundry particular crops.",
    "Presently moving up a little Rowley was able to address Beatrice in a\nquiet voice\n\nGot a stranger staying here Big man Slouch hat\n\nThats right Mr Rowley.",
    "Came along about six oclock.",
    "That the one\nyou mean\n\nRowley nodded.",
    "He passed my place.",
    "Asked his way.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Seems a stranger.",
    "I wondered said Rowley who he was.",
    "He looked at Beatrice and smiled.",
    "Beatrice smiled back.",
    "Thats easy Mr Rowley if youd like to know.",
    "She dipped under the bar and out to return with a fat leather volume\nwherein were registered the arrivals.",
    "She opened it at the page showing the most recent entries.",
    "The last of\nthese ran as follows\n\nEnoch Arden.",
    "Cape Town.",
    "British.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nIt was a fine morning.",
    "The birds were singing and Rosaleen coming\ndown to breakfast in her expensive peasant dress felt happy.",
    "The doubts and fears that had lately oppressed her seemed to have\nfaded away.",
    "David was in a good temper laughing and teasing her.",
    "His\nvisit to London on the previous day had been satisfactory.",
    "Breakfast\nwas well cooked and well served.",
    "They had just finished it when the\npost arrived.",
    "There were seven or eight letters for Rosaleen.",
    "Bills charitable\nappeals some local invitations  nothing of any special interest.",
    "David laid aside a couple of small bills and opened the third envelope.",
    "The enclosure like the outside of the envelope was written in printed\ncharacters.",
    "Dear Mr. Hunter\n\n\fI think it is best to approach you rather than your sister Mrs Cloade\nin case the contents of this letter might come as somewhat of a shock\nto her.",
    "Briefly I have news of Captain Robert Underhay which she\nmay be glad to hear.",
    "I am staying at the Stag and if you will call there\nthis evening I shall be pleased to go into the matter with you.",
    "Yours faithfully\n\nEnoch Arden.",
    "A strangled sound came from Davids throat.",
    "Rosaleen looked up\nsmiling then her face changed to an expression of alarm.",
    "David  David  what is it\n\nMutely he held out the letter to her.",
    "She took it and read it.",
    "But  David  I dont understand  what does it mean\n\nYou can read cant you\n\nShe glanced up at him timorously.",
    "David  does it mean  what are we going to do\n\nHe was frowning  planning rapidly in his quick farseeing mind.",
    "Its all right Rosaleen no need to be worried.",
    "Ill deal with it \n\n\fBut does it mean that \n\nDont worry my dear girl.",
    "Leave it to me.",
    "Listen this is what youve\ngot to do.",
    "Pack a bag at once and go up to London.",
    "Go to the flat  and\nstay there until you hear from me Understand\n\nYes.",
    "Yes of course I understand but David \n\nJust do as I say Rosaleen.",
    "He smiled at her.",
    "He was kindly\nreassuring.",
    "Go and pack.",
    "Ill drive you to the station.",
    "You can catch\nthe 10.32.",
    "Tell the porter at the flats that you dont want to see any one.",
    "If any one calls and asks for you hes to say youre out of town.",
    "Give\nhim a quid.",
    "Understand Hes not to let any one up to see you except\nme.",
    "Oh.",
    "Her hands went up to her cheeks.",
    "She looked at him with scared\nlovely eyes.",
    "Its all right Rosaleen  but its tricky.",
    "Youre not much hand at the\ntricky stuff.",
    "Thats my look out.",
    "I want you out of the way so that Ive\ngot a free hand thats all.",
    "Cant I stay here David\n\nNo of course you cant Rosaleen.",
    "Do have some sense.",
    "Ive got to\nhave a free hand to deal with this fellow whoever he is \n\nDo you think that its  that its \n\n\fHe said with emphasis\n\nI dont think anything at the moment.",
    "The first thing is to get you out of\nthe way.",
    "Then I can find out where we stand.",
    "Go on  theres a good\ngirl dont argue.",
    "She turned and went out of the room.",
    "David frowned down at the letter in his hand.",
    "Very noncommittal  polite  well phrased  might mean anything.",
    "It\nmight be genuine solicitude in an awkward situation.",
    "Might be a veiled\nthreat.",
    "He conned its phrases over and over  I have news of Captain\nRobert Underhay... Best to approach you...",
    "I shall be pleased to go\ninto the matter with you... Mrs Cloade.",
    "Damn it all he didnt like\nthose inverted commas  Mrs Cloade.",
    "He looked at the signature.",
    "Enoch Arden.",
    "Something stirred in his mind  some poetical memory...\na line of verse.",
    "When David strode into the hall of the Stag that evening there was as\nwas usual no one about.",
    "A door at the left was marked Coffee Room a\ndoor on the right was marked Lounge.",
    "A door farther along was\nmarked repressively For Resident Guests Only.",
    "A passage on the\nright led along to the Bar from whence a faint hum of voices could be\nheard.",
    "A small glassencased box was labelled Office and had a pushbell placed conveniently on the side of its sliding window.",
    "Sometimes as David knew by experience you had to ring four or five\ntimes before any one condescended to come and attend to you.",
    "Except\n\n\ffor the short period of meal times the hall of the Stag was as deserted\nas Robinson Crusoes island\n\nThis time Davids third ring of the bell brought Miss Beatrice\nLippencott along the passage from the bar her hand patting her\ngolden pompadour of hair into place.",
    "She slipped into the glass box\nand greeted him with a gracious smile.",
    "Good evening Mr Hunter.",
    "Rather cold weather for the time of year\nisnt it\n\nYes  I suppose it is.",
    "Have you got a Mr Arden staying here\n\nLet me see now said Miss Lippincott making rather a parade of not\nknowing exactly a proceeding she always adopted as tending to\nincrease the importance of the Stag.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Mr Enoch Arden.",
    "No.",
    "5.",
    "On the first floor.",
    "You cant miss it Mr Hunter.",
    "Up the stairs and dont\ngo along the gallery but round to the left and down three steps.",
    "Following these complicated directions David tapped on the door of\nNo.",
    "5 and a voice said Come in.",
    "He went in closing the door behind him.",
    "Coming out of the office Beatrice Lippincott called Lily.",
    "An\nadenoidal girl with a giggle and pale boiled gooseberry eyes\nresponded to the summons.",
    "Can you manage for a bit Lily Ive got to see about some linen.",
    "Lily said Oh yes Miss Lippincott gave a giggle and added sighing\ngustily I do think Mr Hunters ever so goodlooking dont you\n\nAh Ive seen a lot of his type in the war said Miss Lippincott with a\nworldweary air.",
    "Young pilots and suchlike from the fighter station.",
    "Never could be sure about their cheques.",
    "Often had such a way with\nthem that youd cash the things against your better judgment.",
    "But of\ncourse Im funny that way Lily what I like is class.",
    "Give me class\nevery time.",
    "What I say is a gentlemans a gentleman even if he does\ndrive a tractor.",
    "With which enigmatic pronouncement Beatrice left Lily and went up\nthe stairs.",
    "Inside room No.",
    "5 David Hunter paused inside the door and looked at\nthe man who had signed himself Enoch Arden.",
    "Fortyish knocked about a bit a suggestion of having come down in the\nworld  on the whole a difficult customer.",
    "Such was Davids summing\nup.",
    "Apart from that not easy to fathom.",
    "A dark horse.",
    "Arden said\n\nHallo  you Hunter Good.",
    "Sit down.",
    "Whatll you have Whisky\n\nHed made himself comfortable David noted that.",
    "A modest array of\nbottles  a fire burning in the grate on this chilly Spring evening.",
    "Clothes not English cut but worn as an Englishman wears clothes.",
    "The man was the right age too...",
    "Thanks David said Ill have a spot of whisky.",
    "Say When.",
    "When.",
    "Not too much soda.",
    "They were a little like dogs maneuvering for position  circling round\neach other backs stiff hackles up ready to be friendly or ready to\nsnarl and snap.",
    "Cheerio said Arden.",
    "Cheerio.",
    "They set their glasses down relaxed a little.",
    "Round One was over.",
    "The man who called himself Enoch Arden said\n\nYou were surprised to get my letter\n\nFrankly said David I dont understand it at all.",
    "Nno  nno  well perhaps not.",
    "David said\n\nI understand you knew my sisters first husband  Robert Underhay.",
    "Yes I knew Robert very well.",
    "Arden was smiling blowing clouds of\nsmoke idly up in the air.",
    "As well perhaps as any one could know him.",
    "You never met him did you.",
    "Hunter\n\nNo.",
    "Oh perhaps thats as well.",
    "What do you mean by that David asked sharply.",
    "Arden said easily\n\nMy dear fellow it makes everything much simpler  thats all.",
    "I\napologise for asking you to come here but I did think it was best to\nkeep  he paused  Rosaleen out of it all.",
    "No need to give her\nunnecessary pain.",
    "Do you mind coming to the point\n\nOf course of course.",
    "Well now did you ever suspect  how shall we\nsay  that there was anything  well  fishy  about Underhays death\n\nWhat on earth do you mean\n\nWell Underhay had rather peculiar ideas you know.",
    "It may have been\nchivalry  it may just possibly have been for quite a different reason but lets say that at a particular moment some years ago there were\ncertain advantages to Underhay in being considered dead.",
    "He was\ngood at managing natives  always had been.",
    "No trouble to him to get a\nprobable story circulated with any amount of corroborative detail.",
    "All\n\n\fUnderhay had to do was to turn up about a thousand miles away  with\na new name.",
    "It seems a most fantastic supposition to me said David.",
    "Does it Does it really Arden smiled.",
    "He leaned forward tapped\nDavid on the knee.",
    "Suppose its true Hunter Eh Suppose its true\n\nI should require very definite proof of it.",
    "Would you Well of course theres no superdefinite proof.",
    "Underhay\nhimself could turn up here  in Warmsley Vale.",
    "Howd you like that for\nproof\n\nIt would at least be conclusive said David dryly.",
    "Oh yes conclusive  but just a little embarrassing  for Mrs Gordon\nCloade I mean.",
    "Because then of course she wouldnt be Mrs Gordon\nCloade.",
    "Awkward.",
    "You must admit just a little bit awkward\n\nMy sister said David remarried in perfectly good faith.",
    "Of course she did my dear fellow.",
    "Of course she did.",
    "Im not disputing\nthat for a second.",
    "Any judge would say the same.",
    "No actual blame\ncould attach to her.",
    "Judge said David sharply.",
    "The other said as though apologetically\n\n\fI was thinking of bigamy.",
    "Just what are you driving at asked David savagely.",
    "Now dont get excited old boy.",
    "We just want to put our heads\ntogether and see whats best to be done  best for your sister thats to\nsay.",
    "Nobody wants a lot of dirty publicity.",
    "Underhay  well Underhay\nwas always a chivalrous kind of chap.",
    "Arden paused.",
    "He still is...\n\nIs asked David sharply.",
    "Thats what I said.",
    "You say Robert Underhay is alive.",
    "Where is he now\n\nArden leaned forward  his voice became confidential.",
    "Do you really want to know Hunter Wouldnt it be better if you didnt\nknow Put it that as far as you know and as far as Rosaleen knows\nUnderhay died in Africa.",
    "Very good and if Underhay is alive he\ndoesnt know his wife has married again he hasnt the least idea of it.",
    "Because of course if he did know he would have come forward...\nRosaleen you see has inherited a good deal of money from her\nsecond husband  well then of course she isnt entitled to any of that\nmoney... Underhay is a man with a very sensitive sense of honour.",
    "He\nwouldnt like her inheriting money under false pretences.",
    "He paused.",
    "But of course its possible that Underhay doesnt know anything about\nher second marriage.",
    "Hes in a bad way poor fellow  in a very bad\nway.",
    "What do you mean by in a bad way\n\nArden shook his head solemnly.",
    "Broken down in health.",
    "He needs medical attention  special\ntreatments  all unfortunately rather expensive.",
    "The last word dropped delicately as though into a category of its own.",
    "It was the word for which David Hunter had been unconsciously\nwaiting.",
    "He said\n\nExpensive\n\nYes  unfortunately everything costs money.",
    "Underhay poor devil is\npractically destitute.",
    "He added Hes got practically nothing but what\nhe stands up in.",
    "Just for a moment Davids eyes wandered round the room.",
    "He noted\nthe pack slung on a chair.",
    "There was no suitcase to be seen.",
    "I wonder said David and his voice was not pleasant if Robert\nUnderhay is quite the chivalrous gentleman you make him out to be.",
    "He was once the other assured him.",
    "But life you know is inclined\nto make a fellow cynical.",
    "He paused and added softly Gordon\nCloade was really an incredibly wealthy fellow.",
    "The spectacle of too\nmuch wealth arouses ones baser instincts.",
    "David Hunter got up.",
    "Ive got an answer for you.",
    "Go to the devil.",
    "Unperturbed Arden said smiling\n\nYes I thought youd say that.",
    "Youre a damned blackmailer neither more nor less.",
    "Ive a good mind\nto call your bluff.",
    "Publish and be damned An admirable sentiment.",
    "But you wouldnt\nlike it if I did publish.",
    "Not that I shall.",
    "If you wont buy Ive another\nmarket.",
    "What do you mean\n\nThe Cloades.",
    "Suppose I go to them.",
    "Excuse me but would you be\ninterested to learn that the late Robert Underhay is very much alive\nWhy man theyll jump at it\n\nDavid said scornfully\n\nYou wont get anything out of them.",
    "Theyre broke every one of\nthem.",
    "Ah but theres such a thing as a working arrangement.",
    "So much in\ncash on the day its proved that Underhay is alive that Mrs Gordon\nCloade is still Mrs Robert Underhay and that consequently Gordon\nCloades will made before his marriage is good in law...\n\n\fFor some few minutes David sat silent then he asked bluntly\n\nHow much\n\nThe answer came as bluntly\n\nTwenty thousand.",
    "Out of the question My sister cant touch the capital shes only got a\nlife interest.",
    "Ten thousand then.",
    "She can raise that easily.",
    "Theres jewellery isnt\nthere\n\nDavid sat silent then he said unexpectedly\n\nAll right.",
    "For a moment the other man seemed at a loss.",
    "It was as though the\nease of his victory surprised him.",
    "No cheques he said.",
    "To be paid in notes\n\nYoull have to give us time  to get hold of the money.",
    "Ill give you fortyeight hours.",
    "Make it next Tuesday.",
    "All right.",
    "Youll bring the money here.",
    "He added before David could\nspeak.",
    "Im not meeting you at a lonely copse  or a deserted river\nbank so dont you think so.",
    "Youll bring the money here  to the Stag at nine oclock next Tuesday evening.",
    "Suspicious sort of chap arent you\n\nI know my way about.",
    "And I know your kind.",
    "As you said then.",
    "David went out of the room and down the stairs.",
    "His face was black\nwith rage.",
    "Beatrice Lippincott came out of the room marked No.",
    "4.",
    "There was a\ncommunicating door between 4 and 5 though the fact could hardly be\nnoted by an occupant in 5 since a wardrobe stood upright in front of it.",
    "Miss Lippincotts cheeks were pink and her eyes bright with\npleasurable excitement.",
    "She smoothed back her pompadour of hair with an agitated hand.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nShepherds Court Mayfair was a large block of luxury service flats.",
    "Unharmed by the ravages of enemy action they had nevertheless\nbeen unable to keep up quite their prewar standard of ease.",
    "There was service still although not very good service.",
    "Where there\nhad been two uniformed porters there was now only one.",
    "The\nrestaurant still served meals but except for breakfast meals were not\nsent up to the apartments.",
    "The flat rented by Mrs Gordon Cloade was on the third floor.",
    "It\nconsisted of a sittingroom with a builtin cocktail bar two bedrooms\nwith builtin cupboards and a superbly appointed bathroom gleaming\nwith tiles and chromium.",
    "In the sittingroom David Hunter was striding up and down whilst\nRosaleen sat on a big squareended settee watching him.",
    "She looked\npale and frightened.",
    "Blackmail he muttered.",
    "Blackmail My God am I the kind of man to\nlet myself be blackmailed\n\nShe shook her head bewildered troubled.",
    "If I knew David was saying.",
    "If I only knew \n\nFrom Rosaleen there came a small miserable sob.",
    "He went on\n\nIts this working in the dark  working blindfold  He wheeled round\nsuddenly.",
    "You took those emeralds round to Bond Street to old\nGreatorex\n\nYes.",
    "How much\n\nRosaleens voice was stricken as she said\n\nFour thousand.",
    "Four thousand pounds.",
    "He said if I didnt sell them\nthey ought to be reinsured.",
    "Yes  precious stones have doubled in value.",
    "Oh well we can raise the\nmoney.",
    "But if we do its only the beginning  it means being bled to\ndeath  bled Rosaleen bled white\n\nShe cried\n\nOh lets leave England  lets get away couldnt we go to Ireland America  somewhere\n\nHe turned and looked at her.",
    "Youre not a fighter are you Rosaleen Cut and run is your motto.",
    "She wailed Were wrong  all this has been wrong  very wicked.",
    "Dont turn pious on me just now I cant stand it.",
    "We were sitting\npretty Rosaleen.",
    "For the first time in my life I was sitting pretty  and\nIm not going to let it all go do you hear If only it wasnt this cursed\nfighting in the dark.",
    "You understand dont you that the whole thing\nmay be bluff  nothing but bluff Underhays probably safely buried in\nAfrica as weve always thought he was.",
    "She shivered.",
    "Dont David.",
    "You make me afraid.",
    "He looked at her saw the panic in her face and at once his manner\nchanged.",
    "He came over to her sat down took her cold hands in his.",
    "Youre not to worry he said.",
    "Leave it all to me  and do as I tell you.",
    "You can manage that cant you Just do exactly as I tell you.",
    "I always do David.",
    "He laughed.",
    "Yes you always do.",
    "Well snap out of this never you fear.",
    "Ill find a way of scotching Mr Enoch Arden.",
    "Wasnt there a poem David  something about a man coming back \n\nYes.",
    "He cut her short.",
    "Thats just what worries me...",
    "But Ill get to\nthe bottom of things never you fear.",
    "She said\n\nIts Tuesday night you  take him the money\n\nHe nodded.",
    "Five thousand.",
    "Ill tell him I cant raise the rest all at once.",
    "But I must\nstop him going to the Cloades.",
    "I think that was only a threat but I cant\nbe sure.",
    "He stopped his eyes became dreamy far away.",
    "Behind them his mind\nworked considering and rejecting possibilities.",
    "Then he laughed.",
    "It was a gay reckless laugh.",
    "There were men now\ndead who would have recognised it...",
    "It was the laugh of a man going into action on a hazardous and\ndangerous enterprise.",
    "There was enjoyment in it and defiance.",
    "I can trust you Rosaleen he said.",
    "Thank goodness I can trust you\nabsolutely\n\nTrust me She raised her big inquiring eyes.",
    "To do what\n\nHe smiled again.",
    "To do exactly as you are told.",
    "Thats the secret\nRosaleen of a successful operation.",
    "He laughed\n\nOperation Enoch Arden.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nRowley opened the big mauve envelope with some surprise.",
    "Who on\nearth he wondered could be writing to him using that kind of\nstationery  and how did they manage to get it anyway.",
    "These fancy\nlines had surely gone right out during the war.",
    "Dear Mr. Rowley he read\n\n\fI hope you wont think Im taking a liberty in writing to you this way\nbut if youll excuse me I do think there are things going on that you\nought to know about.",
    "He noted the underlining with a puzzled look.",
    "Arising out of our conversation the other evening when you came in\nasking about a certain person.",
    "If you could call in at the Stag Id be\nvery glad to tell you all about it.",
    "Weve all of us felt down here what a\nwicked shame it was about your Uncle dying and his money going the\nway it did.",
    "Hoping you wont be angry with me but I really do think you ought to\nknow whats going on.",
    "Yours ever\n\nBeatrice Lippincott.",
    "Rowley stared down at this missive his mind afire with speculation.",
    "What on earth was all this about Good old Bee.",
    "Hed known Beatrice\nall his life.",
    "Bought tobacco from her fathers shop and passed the time\nof day with her behind the counter.",
    "Shed been a goodlooking girl.",
    "He\nremembered as a child hearing rumours about her during an absence\nof hers from Warmsley Vale.",
    "Shed been away about a year and\neverybody said shed gone away to have an illegitimate baby.",
    "Perhaps\nshe had perhaps she hadnt.",
    "But she was certainly highly respectable\nand refined nowadays.",
    "Plenty of backchat and giggles but an almost\npainful propriety.",
    "Rowley glanced up at the clock.",
    "Hed go along to the Stag right away.",
    "To hell with all those forms.",
    "He wanted to know what it was that\nBeatrice was so anxious to tell him.",
    "It was a little after eight when he pushed open the door of the saloon\nbar.",
    "There were the usual greetings nods of the head Evening sir.",
    "Rowley edged up to the bar and asked for a Guinness.",
    "Beatrice beamed upon him.",
    "Glad to see you Mr Rowley.",
    "Evening Beatrice.",
    "Thanks for your note.",
    "She gave him a quick glance.",
    "Ill be with you in a minute Mr Rowley.",
    "He nodded  and drank his half pint meditatively whilst he watched\nBeatrice finish serving out.",
    "She called over her shoulder and presently\nthe girl Lily came in to relieve her.",
    "Beatrice murmured If youll come\nwith me Mr Rowley\n\nShe led him along a passage and in through a door marked Private.",
    "Inside it was very small and overfurnished with plush armchairs a\nblaring radio a lot of china ornaments and a rather batteredlooking\npierrot doll thrown across the back of a chair.",
    "Beatrice Lippincott turned off the radio and indicated a plush\narmchair.",
    "Im ever so glad you came up Mr Rowley and I hope you didnt mind\nmy writing to you  but Ive been turning it over in my mind all over the\nweekend  and as I said I really felt you ought to know whats going\non.",
    "She was looking happy and important clearly pleased with herself.",
    "Rowley asked with mild curiosity\n\nWhat is going on\n\nWell Mr Rowley you know the gentleman whos staying here  Mr\nArden the one you came and asked about.",
    "Yes\n\nIt was the very next evening.",
    "Mr Hunter came along and asked for\nhim.",
    "Mr Hunter\n\nRowley sat up interestedly.",
    "Yes Mr Rowley.",
    "No.",
    "5 I said and Mr Hunter nodded and went straight\nup.",
    "I was surprised I must say for this Mr Arden hadnt said he knew\nany one in Warmsley Vale and Id kind of taken it for granted he was a\nstranger here and didnt know any one in the place.",
    "Very out of temper\n\n\fMr Hunter looked as though something had happened to upset him but\nof course I didnt make anything of it then\n\nShe paused for breath.",
    "Rowley said nothing just listened.",
    "He never\nhurried people.",
    "If they liked to take their time it suited him.",
    "Beatrice continued with dignity\n\nIt was just a little later I had occasion to go up to No.",
    "4 to see to the\ntowels and the bed linen.",
    "Thats next door to No.",
    "5 and as it happens\ntheres a communicating door  not that youd know it from No.",
    "5\nbecause the big wardrobe there stands right across it so that you\nwouldnt know there was a door.",
    "Of course its always kept shut but as\nit happened this time it was just a bit open  though who opened it Ive\nno idea Im sure\n\nAgain Rowley said nothing but just nodded his head.",
    "Beatrice he thought had opened it.",
    "She had been curious and had\ngone up deliberately to No.",
    "4 to find out what she could.",
    "And so you see Mr Rowley I couldnt help hearing what was going\non.",
    "Really you could have knocked me over with a feather \n\nA pretty substantial feather thought Rowley would be needed.",
    "He listened with an impassive almost bovine face to Beatrices\nsuccinct account of the conversation she had overheard.",
    "When she had finished she waited expectantly.",
    "It was fully a couple of minutes before Rowley came out of his trance.",
    "Then he got up.",
    "Thanks Beatrice he said.",
    "Thanks a lot.",
    "And with that he went straight out of the room.",
    "Beatrice felt somewhat\ndeflated.",
    "She really did think she said to herself that Mr Rowley might\nhave said something.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nWhen Rowley left the Stag his steps turned automatically in the\ndirection of home but after walking a few hundred yards he pulled up\nshort and retraced his steps.",
    "His mind took things in slowly and his first astonishment over\nBeatrices revelations was only now beginning to give way to a true\nappreciation of the significance.",
    "If her version of what she had overheard was correct and he had no\ndoubt that in substance it was so then a situation had arisen which\nconcerned every member of the Cloade family closely.",
    "The person\nmost fitted to deal with this was clearly Rowleys Uncle Jeremy.",
    "As a\nsolicitor Jeremy Cloade would know what use could best be made of\nthis surprising information and exactly what steps to take.",
    "Though Rowley would have liked to take action himself he realised\nrather grudgingly that it would be far better to lay the matter before a\nshrewd and experienced lawyer.",
    "The sooner Jeremy was in\n\n\fpossession of this information the better and accordingly Rowley bent\nhis footsteps straight to Jeremys house in the High Street.",
    "The little maid who opened the door informed him that Mr and Mrs\nCloade were still at the dinner table.",
    "She would have shown him in\nthere but Rowley negatived this and said he would wait in Jeremys\nstudy till they had finished.",
    "He did not particularly want to include\nFrances in the colloquy.",
    "Indeed the fewer people who knew about it\nthe better until they should have determined on a definite course of\naction.",
    "He wandered restlessly up and down Jeremys study.",
    "On the flattopped desk was a tin dispatch box labelled Sir William Jessamy\nDeceased.",
    "The shelves held a collection of legal tomes.",
    "There was an\nold photograph of Frances in evening dress and one of her father Lord\nEdward Trenton in riding kit.",
    "On the desk was the picture of a young\nman in uniform  Jeremys son Antony killed in the war.",
    "Rowley winced and turned away.",
    "He sat down in a chair and stared at\nLord Edward Trenton instead.",
    "In the diningroom Frances said to her husband\n\nI wonder what Rowley wants\n\nJeremy said wearily\n\nProbably fallen foul of some Government regulation.",
    "No farmer\nunderstands more than a quarter of these forms they have to fill up.",
    "Rowleys a conscientious fellow.",
    "He gets worried.",
    "Hes nice said Frances but terribly slow.",
    "I have a feeling you\nknow that things arent going too well between him and Lynn.",
    "Jeremy murmured vacantly\n\nLynn  oh yes of course.",
    "Forgive me I  I dont seem able to\nconcentrate.",
    "The strain \n\nFrances said swiftly\n\nDont think about it.",
    "Its going to be all right I tell you.",
    "You frighten me sometimes Frances.",
    "Youre so terribly reckless.",
    "You\ndont realise \n\nI realise everything.",
    "Im not afraid.",
    "Really you know Jeremy Im\nrather enjoying myself \n\nThat my dear said Jeremy is just what causes me such anxiety.",
    "She smiled.",
    "Come she said.",
    "You mustnt keep that bucolic young man waiting\ntoo long.",
    "Go and help him to fill up form eleven hundred and ninetynine or whatever it is.",
    "But as they came out of the diningroom the front door banged shut.",
    "Edna came to tell them that Mr Rowley had said he wouldnt wait and\nthat it was nothing that really mattered.",
    "Chapter 13\n\nOn that particular Tuesday afternoon Lynn Marchmont had gone for a\nlong walk.",
    "Conscious of a growing restlessness and dissatisfaction\nwith herself she felt the need for thinking things out.",
    "She had not seen Rowley for some days.",
    "After their somewhat stormy\nparting on the morning she had asked him to lend her five hundred\npounds they had met as usual.",
    "Lynn realised that her demand had\nbeen unreasonable and that Rowley had been well within his rights in\nturning it down.",
    "Nevertheless reasonableness has never been a quality\nthat appeals to lovers.",
    "Outwardly things were the same between her\nand Rowley inwardly she was not so sure.",
    "The last few days she had\nfound unbearably monotonous yet hardly liked to acknowledge to\nherself that David Hunters sudden departure to London with his sister\nmight have something to do with their monotony.",
    "David she admitted\nruefully was an exciting person...\n\nAs for her relations at the moment she found them all unbearably\ntrying.",
    "Her mother was in the best of spirits and had annoyed Lynn at lunch\nthat day by announcing that she was going to try and find a second\ngardener.",
    "Old Tom really cant keep up with things here.",
    "But darling we cant afford it Lynn had exclaimed.",
    "Nonsense I really think Lynn that Gordon would be terribly upset if\nhe could see how the garden has gone down.",
    "He was so particular\n\n\falways about the border and the grass being kept mown and the\npaths in good order  and just look at it now.",
    "I feel Gordon would want\nit put in order again.",
    "Even if we have to borrow money from his widow to do it.",
    "I told you Lynn Rosaleen couldnt have been nicer about it.",
    "I really\nthink she quite saw my point of view.",
    "I have a nice balance at the bank\nafter paying all the bills.",
    "And I really think a second gardener would be\nan economy.",
    "Think of the extra vegetables we could grow.",
    "We could buy a lot of extra vegetables for a good deal less than\nanother three pounds a week.",
    "I think we could get someone for less than that dear.",
    "There are men\ncoming out of the Services now who want jobs.",
    "The paper says so.",
    "Lynn said dryly I doubt if youll find them in Warmsley Vale  or in\nWarmsley Heath.",
    "But although the matter was left like that the tendency of her mother\nto count on Rosaleen as a regular source of support haunted Lynn.",
    "It\nrevived the memory of Davids sneering words.",
    "So feeling disgruntled and out of temper she set out to walk her black\nmood off.",
    "Her temper was not improved by a meeting with Aunt Kathie outside\nthe post office.",
    "Aunt Kathie was in good spirits.",
    "I think Lynn dear that we shall soon have good news.",
    "What on earth do you mean.",
    "Aunt Kathie\n\nMrs Cloade nodded and smiled and looked wise.",
    "Ive had the most astonishing communications  really astonishing.",
    "A\nsimple happy end to all our troubles.",
    "I had one setback but since then\nIve got the message to Try try try again.",
    "If at first you dont succeed\netc... Im not going to betray any secrets Lynn dear and the last thing\nI should want to do would be to raise false hopes prematurely but I\nhave the strongest belief that things will very soon be quite all right.",
    "And quite time too.",
    "I am really very worried about your uncle.",
    "He\nworked far too hard during the war.",
    "He really needs to retire and\ndevote himself to his specialised studies  but of course he cant do\nthat without an adequate income.",
    "And sometimes he has such queer\nnervous fits I am really very worried about him.",
    "He is really quite odd.",
    "Lynn nodded thoughtfully.",
    "The change in Lionel Cloade had not\nescaped her notice nor his curious alternation of moods.",
    "She\nsuspected that he occasionally had recourse to drugs to stimulate\nhimself and she wondered whether he were not to a certain extent an\naddict.",
    "It would account for his extreme nervous irritability.",
    "She wondered how much Aunt Kathie knew or guessed.",
    "Aunt Kathie\nthought Lynn was not such a fool as she looked.",
    "Going down the High Street she caught a glimpse of her Uncle Jeremy\nletting himself into his front door.",
    "He looked Lynn thought very much\nolder just in these last three weeks.",
    "She quickened her pace.",
    "She wanted to get out of Warmsley Vale up\non to the hills and open spaces.",
    "Setting out at a brisk pace she soon\nfelt better.",
    "She would go for a good tramp of six or seven miles  and\nreally think things out.",
    "Always all her life she had been a resolute\nclearheaded person.",
    "She had known what she wanted and what she\ndidnt want.",
    "Never until now had she been content just to drift along...",
    "Yes that was just what it was Drifting along An aimless formless\nmethod of living.",
    "Ever since she had come out of the Service.",
    "A wave\nof nostalgia swept over her for those war days.",
    "Days when duties were\nclearly defined when life was planned and orderly  when the weight of\nindividual decisions had been lifted from her.",
    "But even as she\nformulated the idea she was horrified at herself.",
    "Was that really and\ntruly what people were secretly feeling elsewhere Was that what\nultimately war did to you It was not the physical dangers  the mines\nat sea the bombs from the air the crisp ping of a rifle bullet as you\ndrove over a desert track.",
    "No it was the spiritual danger of learning\nhow much easier life was if you ceased to think... She Lynn\nMarchmont was no longer the clearheaded resolute intelligent girl\nwho had joined up.",
    "Her intelligence had been specialised directed in\nwelldefined channels.",
    "Now mistress of herself and her life once more\nshe was appalled at the disinclination of her mind to seize and grapple\nwith her own personal problems.",
    "With a sudden wry smile Lynn thought to herself Odd if its really that\nnewspaper character the housewife who has come into her own\nthrough war conditions.",
    "The women who hindered by innumerable\nshall nots were not helped by any definite shalls.",
    "Women who had\nto plan and think and improvise who had to use every inch of the\n\n\fingenuity they had been given and to develop an ingenuity that they\ndidnt know they had got They alone thought Lynn now could stand\nupright without a crutch responsible for themselves and others.",
    "And she Lynn Marchmont well educated clever having done a job\nthat needed brains and close application was now rudderless devoid\nof resolution  yes hateful word drifting...",
    "The people who had stayed at home Rowley for instance.",
    "But at once Lynns mind dropped from vague generalities to the\nimmediate personal.",
    "Herself and Rowley.",
    "That was the problem the real problem  the only\nproblem.",
    "Did she really want to marry Rowley\n\nSlowly the shadows lengthened to twilight and dusk.",
    "Lynn sat\nmotionless her chin cupped in her hands on the outskirts of a small\ncopse on the hillside looking down over the valley.",
    "She had lost count\nof time but she knew that she was strangely reluctant to go home to\nthe White House.",
    "Below her away to the left was Long Willows.",
    "Long Willows her home\nif she married Rowley.",
    "If It came back to that  if  if  if\n\n\fA bird flew out of the wood with a startled cry like the cry of an angry\nchild.",
    "A billow of smoke from a train went eddying up in the sky forming as it\ndid so a giant question mark\n\nShall I marry Rowley Do I want to marry Rowley Did I ever want to\nmarry Rowley Could I bear not to marry Rowley\n\nThe train puffed away up the valley the smoke quivered and\ndispersed.",
    "But the question mark did not fade from Lynns mind.",
    "She had loved Rowley before she went away.",
    "But Ive come home\nchanged she thought.",
    "Im not the same Lynn.",
    "A line of poetry flared\ninto her mind.",
    "Life and the world and mine own self are changed...\n\nAnd Rowley Rowley hadnt changed.",
    "Yes that was it.",
    "Rowley hadnt changed.",
    "Rowley was where she had\nleft him four years ago.",
    "Did she want to marry Rowley If not what did she want\n\nTwigs cracked in the copse behind her and a mans voice cursed as he\npushed his way through.",
    "She cried out David\n\nLynn He looked amazed as he came crashing through the\nundergrowth.",
    "What in the name of fortune are you doing here\n\n\fHe had been running and was slightly out of breath.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Just thinking  sitting and thinking.",
    "She laughed\nuncertainly.",
    "I suppose  its getting very late.",
    "Havent you any idea of the time\n\nShe looked down vaguely at her wristwatch.",
    "Its stopped again.",
    "I disorganise watches.",
    "More than watches David said.",
    "Its the electricity in you.",
    "The\nvitality.",
    "The life.",
    "He came up to her and vaguely disturbed she rose quickly to her feet.",
    "Its getting quite dark.",
    "I must hurry home.",
    "What time is it David\n\nQuarter past nine.",
    "I must run like a hare.",
    "I simply must catch the 9.20\ntrain to London.",
    "I didnt know you had come back here\n\nI had to get some things from Furrowbank.",
    "But I must catch this train.",
    "Rosaleens alone in the flat  and she gets the jitters if shes alone at\nnight in London.",
    "In a service flat Lynns voice was scornful.",
    "David said sharply\n\nFear isnt logical.",
    "When youve suffered from blast \n\nLynn was suddenly ashamed  contrite.",
    "She said\n\nIm sorry.",
    "Id forgotten.",
    "With sudden bitterness David cried out\n\nYes its soon forgotten  all of it.",
    "Back to safety Back to tameness\nBack to where we were when the whole bloody show started Creep\ninto our rotten little holes and play safe again.",
    "You too Lynn  youre\njust the same as the rest of them\n\nShe cried Im not.",
    "Im not David.",
    "I was just thinking  now \n\nOf me\n\nHis quickness startled her.",
    "His arm was round her holding him to her.",
    "He kissed her with hot angry lips.",
    "Rowley Cloade he said that oaf By God Lynn you belong to me.",
    "Then as suddenly as he had taken her he released her almost\nthrusting her away from him.",
    "Ill miss the train.",
    "He ran headlong down the hillside.",
    "David...",
    "He turned his head calling back\n\nIll ring you when I get to London...\n\nShe watched him running through the gathering gloom light and\nathletic and full of natural grace.",
    "Then shaken her heart strangely stirred her mind chaotic she\nwalked slowly homeward.",
    "She hesitated a little before going in.",
    "She shrank from her mothers\naffectionate welcome her questions...",
    "Her mother who had borrowed five hundred pounds from people whom\nshe despised.",
    "Weve no right to despise Rosaleen and David thought Lynn as she\nwent very softly upstairs.",
    "Were just the same.",
    "Wed do anything anything for money.",
    "She stood in her bedroom looking curiously at her face in the mirror.",
    "It\nwas she thought the face of a stranger...\n\nAnd then sharply anger shook her.",
    "If Rowley really loved me she thought hed have got that five\nhundred pounds for me somehow.",
    "He would  he would.",
    "He wouldnt let\nme be humiliated by having to take it from David  David \n\nDavid had said he would ring her when he got to London.",
    "She went downstairs walking in a dream...\n\nDreams she thought could be very dangerous things...\n\nChapter 14\n\nOh there you are Lynn.",
    "Adelas voice was brisk and relieved.",
    "I\ndidnt hear you come in darling.",
    "Have you been in long\n\nOh yes ages.",
    "I was upstairs.",
    "I wish youd tell me when you come in Lynn.",
    "Im always nervous when\nyoure out alone after dark.",
    "Really Mums dont you think I can look after myself\n\nWell there have been dreadful things in the papers lately.",
    "All these\ndischarged soldiers  they attack girls.",
    "I expect the girls ask for it.",
    "She smiled  rather a twisted smile.",
    "Yes girls did ask for danger...\nWho after all really wanted to be safe...\n\n\fLynn darling are you listening\n\nLynn brought her mind back with a jerk.",
    "Her mother had been talking.",
    "What did you say Mums\n\nI was talking about your bridesmaids dear.",
    "I suppose theyll be able\nto produce the coupons all right.",
    "Its very lucky for you having all your\ndemob ones.",
    "Im really terribly sorry for girls who get married\nnowadays on just their ordinary coupons.",
    "I mean they just cant have\nanything new at all.",
    "Not outside I mean.",
    "What with the state all ones\nundies are in nowadays one just has to go for them.",
    "Yes Lynn you\nreally are lucky.",
    "Oh very lucky.",
    "She was walking round the room  prowling picking up things putting\nthem down.",
    "Must you be so terribly restless dear You make me feel quite\njumpy\n\nSorry Mums.",
    "Theres nothing the matter is there\n\nWhat should be the matter asked Lynn sharply.",
    "Well dont jump down my throat darling.",
    "Now about bridesmaids.",
    "I\nreally think you ought to ask the Macrae girl.",
    "Her mother was my\nclosest friend remember and I do think shell be hurt if \n\nI loathe Joan Macrae and always have.",
    "I know darling but does that really matter Marjorie will Im sure\nfeel hurt \n\nReally Mums its my wedding isnt it\n\nYes I know Lynn but \n\nIf there is a wedding at all\n\nShe hadnt meant to say that.",
    "The words slipped out without her having\nplanned them.",
    "She would have caught them back but it was too late.",
    "Mrs Marchmont was staring at her daughter in alarm.",
    "Lynn darling what do you mean\n\nOh nothing Mums.",
    "You and Rowley havent quarrelled\n\nNo of course not.",
    "Dont fuss Mums everythings all right.",
    "But Adela was looking at her daughter in real alarm sensitive to the\nturmoil behind Lynns frowning exterior.",
    "Ive always felt youd be so safe married to Rowley she said\npiteously.",
    "Who wants to be safe Lynn asked scornfully.",
    "She turned sharply.",
    "Was that the telephone\n\nNo.",
    "Why Are you expecting a call\n\nLynn shook her head.",
    "Humiliating to be waiting for the telephone to\nring.",
    "He had said he would ring her tonight.",
    "He must.",
    "Youre mad she told herself.",
    "Mad.",
    "Why did this man attract her so The memory of his dark unhappy face\nrose up before her eyes.",
    "She tried to banish it tried to replace it by\nRowleys broad goodlooking countenance.",
    "His slow smile his\naffectionate glance.",
    "But did Rowley she thought really care about\nher Surely if hed really cared hed have understood that day when\nshe came to him and begged for five hundred pounds.",
    "Hed have\nunderstood instead of being so maddeningly reasonable and matteroffact.",
    "Marry Rowley live on the farm never go away again never see foreign\nskies smell exotic smells  never again be free...",
    "Sharply the telephone rang.",
    "Lynn took a deep breath walked across\nthe hall and picked up the receiver.",

    "Lynn Is that you Oh Im so glad.",
    "Im afraid you know Ive made\nrather a muddle  about the meeting at the Institute \n\nThe thin fluttering voice went on.",
    "Lynn listened interpolated\ncomments uttered reassurances received thanks.",
    "Such a comfort dear Lynn you are always so kind and so practical.",
    "I\nreally cant imagine how I get things so muddled up.",
    "Lynn couldnt imagine either.",
    "Aunt Kathies capacity for muddling the\nsimplest issues amounted practically to genius.",
    "But I always do say finished Aunt Kathie that everything goes\nwrong at once.",
    "Our telephone is out of order and Ive had to go out to a\ncallbox and now Im here I hadnt got twopence only halfpennies and I had to go and ask \n\nIt petered out at last.",
    "Lynn hung up and went back to the drawingroom.",
    "Adela Marchmont alert asked Was that  and paused.",
    "Lynn said quickly Aunt Kathie.",
    "What did she want\n\nOh just one of her usual muddles.",
    "Lynn sat down again with a book glancing up at the clock.",
    "Yes  it had\nbeen too early.",
    "She couldnt expect her call yet.",
    "At five minutes past eleven the telephone rang again.",
    "She went slowly\nout to it.",
    "This time she wouldnt expect  it was probably Aunt Kathie again...",
    "But no.",
    "Warmsley Vale 34 Can Miss Lynn Marchmont take a personal\ncall from London\n\nHer heart missed a beat.",
    "This is Miss Lynn Marchmont speaking.",
    "Hold on please.",
    "She waited  confused noises  then silence.",
    "The telephone service\nwas getting worse and worse.",
    "She waited.",
    "Finally she depressed the\nreceiver angrily.",
    "Another womans voice indifferent cold spoke was\nuninterested.",
    "Hang up please.",
    "Youll be called later.",
    "She hung up went back towards the drawingroom the bell rang again\nas she had her hand on the door.",

    "Yes...\n\nLook here Lynn I think Id better clear out \n\nWhat do you mean\n\nClear out of England altogether.",
    "Oh its easy enough.",
    "Ive pretended\nit wasnt to Rosaleen  simply because I didnt want to leave Warmsley\nVale.",

    "Youre a\nfine girl Lynn  and as for me Im a bit of a crook always have been.",

    "Lynn are you still there\n\nYes Im here.",
    "You didnt say anything.",
    "What is there to say\n\nLynn\n\nWell...",
    "Strange how clearly she could feel over all that distance his\nexcitement the urgency of his mood...",

    "Chapter 15\n\nIt was the custom at the Stag for guests to be called at whatever hour\nthey named by the simple process of a loud bang on the door and the\nshouted information that it was Eightthirty sir or Eight oclock\nwhatever the case might be.",
    "Early tea was produced if expressly\n\n\fstipulated for and was deposited with a rattle of crockery on the mat\noutside the door.",

    "Its the gentleman in No.",
    "5 Miss.",
    "Hes lying there on the floor dead.",
    "The doctor stared at the girl and then at Miss Lippincott the latter\nstared at Gladys and then at the doctor.",
    "Finally Dr Cloade said uncertainly Nonsense.",
    "Dead as a doornail said Gladys and added with a certain relish Is\neads bashed in\n\nThe doctor looked towards Miss Lippincott.",
    "Perhaps Id better \n\nYes please.",
    "Dr Cloade.",
    "But really  I hardly think  it seems so\nimpossible.",
    "They trooped upstairs Gladys leading the way.",

    "Thats all you can remember\nIll have it typed out for you to read and then if you wouldnt mind\nsigning it \n\nOh dear  I shant have to give evidence in a police court I do hope.",
    "Superintendent Spence smiled appeasingly.",
    "Oh we hope it maynt come to that he said mendaciously.",
    "It may be suicide Beatrice suggested hopefully.",
    "Superintendent Spence forebore to say that a suicide does not usually\ncave in the back of his skull with a pair of steel firetongs.",
    "Instead he\nreplied in the same easy manner\n\nNever any good jumping to conclusions.",
    "Thank you Miss Lippincott.",
    "Very good of you to come forward with this statement so promptly.",
    "When she had been ushered out he ran over her statement in his\nmind.",
    "He knew all about Beatrice Lippincott had a very good idea of\nhow far her accuracy was to be depended upon.",
    "So much for a\nconversation genuinely overheard and remembered.",
    "A little extra\nembroidery for excitements sake.",
    "A little extra still because murder\nhad been done in bedroom No.",
    "5.",
    "But take extras away and what\nremained was ugly and suggestive.",
    "Superintendent Spence looked at the table in front of him.",
    "There was a\nwristwatch with a smashed glass a small gold lighter with initials on it\n\n\fa lipstick in a gilt holder and a pair of heavy steel firetongs the heavy\nhead of which was stained a rusty brown.",
    "Sergeant Graves looked in and said that Mr Rowley Cloade was\nwaiting.",
    "Spence nodded and the Sergeant showed Rowley in.",
    "Just as he knew all about Beatrice Lippincott so the Superintendent\nknew all about Rowley Cloade.",
    "If Rowley had come to the police\nstation it was because Rowley had got something to say and that\nsomething would be solid reliable and unimaginative.",
    "It would in fact\nbe worth hearing.",
    "At the same time Rowley being a deliberate type of\nperson it would take some time to say.",
    "And you couldnt hurry the\nRowley Cloade type.",
    "If you did they became rattled repeated\nthemselves and generally took twice as long...\n\nGood morning Mr Cloade.",
    "Pleased to see you.",
    "Can you throw any\nlight on this problem of ours The man who was killed at the Stag.",
    "Rather to Spences surprise Rowley began with a question.",
    "He asked\nabruptly\n\nHave you identified the fellow\n\nNo said Spence slowly.",
    "I wouldnt say we had.",
    "He signed the\nregister Enoch Arden.",
    "Theres nothing in his possession to show he\nwas Enoch Arden.",
    "Rowley frowned.",
    "Isnt that  rather odd\n\n\fIt was exceedingly odd but Superintendent Spence did not propose to\ndiscuss with Rowley Cloade just how odd he thought it was.",
    "Instead he\nsaid pleasantly\n\nCome now Mr Cloade Im the one who asks the questions.",
    "You went\nto see the dead man last night.",
    "Why\n\nYou know Beatrice Lippincott Superintendent At the Stag.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "And said the Superintendent taking what he hoped\nwould be a short cut Ive heard her story.",
    "She came to me with it.",
    "Rowley looked relieved.",
    "Good.",
    "I was afraid she mightnt want to be mixed up with a police\nmatter.",
    "These people are funny that way sometimes.",
    "The Superintendent nodded.",
    "Well then Beatrice told me what shed overheard and it seemed to\nme  I dont know if it does to you  decidedly fishy.",
    "What I mean is were well were interested parties.",
    "Again the Superintendent nodded.",
    "He had taken a keen local interest\nin Gordon Cloades death and in common with general local opinion he\nconsidered that Gordons family had been badly treated.",
    "He endorsed\nthe common opinion that Mrs Gordon Cloade wasnt a lady and that\nMrs Gordon Cloades brother was one of those young firebrand\n\n\fCommandos who though they had had their uses in time of war were\nto be looked at askance in peacetime.",
    "I dont suppose I need explain to you Superintendent that if Mrs\nGordons first husband is still alive it will make a big difference to us\nas a family.",
    "This story of Beatrices was the first intimation I had that\nsuch a state of affairs might exist.",
    "Id never dreamed of such a thing.",
    "Thought she was definitely a widow.",
    "And I may say it shook me up a\nlot.",
    "Took me a bit of time to realise it as you might say.",
    "You know I had\nto let it soak in.",
    "Spence nodded again.",
    "He could see Rowley slowly ruminating the\nmatter turning it over and over in his mind.",
    "First of all I thought Id better get my uncle on to it  the lawyer one.",
    "Mr Jeremy Cloade\n\nYes so I went along there.",
    "Must have been some time after eight.",
    "They were still at dinner and I sat down in old Jeremys study to wait\nfor him and I went on turning things over in my mind.",
    "Yes\n\nAnd finally I came to the conclusion that Id do a bit more myself\nbefore getting my uncle on to it.",
    "Lawyers Superintendent are all the\nsame Ive found.",
    "Very slow very cautious and have to be absolutely\nsure of their facts before theyll move in a matter.",
    "The information Id\ngot had come to me in a rather holeandcorner manner  and I\n\n\fwondered if old Jeremy might hem and haw a bit about acting on it.",
    "I\ndecided Id go along to the Stag and see this Johnnie for myself.",
    "And you did so\n\nYes.",
    "I went right back to the Stag \n\nAt what time was this\n\nRowley pondered.",
    "Lemme see I must have got to Jeremys about twenty past eight or\nthereabouts  five minutes  well I wouldnt like to say exactly Spence after halfpast eight  perhaps about twenty to nine\n\nYes Mr Cloade\n\nI knew where the bloke was  Bee had mentioned the number of his\nroom  so I went right up and knocked at the door and he said Come\nin and I went in.",
    "Rowley paused.",
    "Somehow I dont think I handled the business very well.",
    "I thought\nwhen I went in that I was the one who was on top.",
    "But the fellow must\nhave been rather a clever fellow.",
    "I couldnt pin him down to anything\ndefinite.",
    "I thought hed be frightened when I hinted hed been doing a\nspot of blackmail but it just seemed to amuse him.",
    "He asked me damned cheek  if I was in the market too You cant play your dirty\ngame with me I said.",
    "Ive nothing to hide.",
    "And he said rather nastily\n\n\fthat that wasnt his meaning.",
    "The point was he said that hed got\nsomething to sell and was I a buyer What do you mean I said.",
    "He\nsaid How much will you  or the family generally  pay me for the\ndefinite proof that Robert Underhay reported dead in Africa is really\nalive and kicking I asked him why the devil we should pay anything at\nall And he laughed and said Because Ive got a client coming this\nevening who certainly will pay a very substantial sum for proof positive\nthat Robert Underhay is dead.",
    "Then  well then Im afraid I rather lost\nmy temper and told him that my family werent used to doing that kind\nof dirty business.",
    "If Underhay was really alive I said the fact ought to\nbe quite easy to establish.",
    "Upon that I was just stalking out when he\nlaughed and said in what was really rather a queer tone I dont think\nyoull prove it without my cooperation.",
    "Funny sort of way he said\nthat.",
    "And then\n\nWell frankly I went home rather disturbed.",
    "Felt you know that Id\nmessed things up.",
    "Rather wished Id left it to old Jeremy to tackle after\nall.",
    "I mean dash it all a lawyers used to dealing with slippery\ncustomers.",
    "What time did you leave the Stag\n\nIve no idea.",
    "Wait a sec.",
    "Must have been just before nine because I\nheard the pips for the news as I was going along the village  through\none of the windows.",
    "Did Arden say who it was he was expecting The client\n\n\fNo.",
    "I took it for granted it was David Hunter.",
    "Who else could it be\n\nHe didnt seem in any way alarmed by the prospect\n\nI tell you the fellow was thoroughly pleased with himself and on top of\nthe world\n\nSpence indicated with a slight gesture the heavy steel tongs.",
    "Did you notice these in the grate Mr Cloade\n\nThose No  I dont think so.",
    "The fire wasnt lit.",
    "He frowned trying to\nvisualise the scene.",
    "There were fireirons in the grate Im sure but I\ncant say I noticed what they were.",
    "He added Was that what \n\nSpence nodded.",
    "Smashed his skull in.",
    "Rowley frowned.",
    "Funny.",
    "Hunters a lightly built chap  Arden was a big man  powerful.",
    "The Superintendent said in a colourless voice\n\nThe medical evidence is that he was struck down from behind and\nthat the blows delivered with the head of the tongs were struck from\nabove.",
    "Rowley said thoughtfully\n\n\fOf course he was a cocksure sort of a bloke  but all the same I\nwouldnt have turned my back with a fellow in the room whom I was\ntrying to bleed white and whod done some pretty tough fighting in the\nwar.",
    "Arden cant have been a very cautious sort of chap.",
    "If he had been cautious very likely hed be alive now said the\nSuperintendent dryly.",
    "I wish to God he was said Rowley fervently.",
    "As it is I feel Ive\nmucked things up thoroughly.",
    "If only I hadnt got on my high horse and\nstalked off I might have got something useful out of him.",
    "I ought to\nhave pretended that we were in the market but the things so damned\nsilly.",
    "I mean who are we to bid against Rosaleen and David Theyve\ngot the cash.",
    "None of us could raise five hundred pounds between us.",
    "The Superintendent picked up the gold lighter.",
    "Seen this before\n\nA crease appeared between Rowleys brows.",
    "He said slowly\n\nIve seen it somewhere yes but I cant remember where.",
    "Not very\nlong ago.",
    "No  I cant remember.",
    "Spence did not give the lighter into Rowleys outstretched hand.",
    "He\nput it down and picked up the lipstick unsheathing it from its case.",
    "And this\n\n\fRowley grinned.",
    "Really thats not in my line.",
    "Superintendent.",
    "Thoughtfully Spence smeared a little on the back of his hand.",
    "He put\nhis head on one side studying it appreciatively.",
    "Brunette colouring I should say he remarked.",
    "Funny things you policemen know said Rowley.",
    "He got up.",
    "And you\ndont  definitely do not  know who the dead man was\n\nHave you any idea yourself Mr Cloade\n\nI only wondered said Rowley slowly.",
    "I mean  this fellow was our\nonly clue to Underhay.",
    "Now that hes dead  well looking for Underhay\nis going to be like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
    "Therell be publicity Mr Cloade said Spence.",
    "Remember that in due\ncourse a lot of this will appear in the press.",
    "If Underhay is alive and\ncomes to read about it  well he may come forward.",
    "Yes said Rowley doubtfully.",
    "He may.",
    "But you dont think so\n\nI think said Rowley Cloade that Round One has gone to David\nHunter.",
    "I wonder said Spence.",
    "As Rowley went out Spence picked up the\ngold lighter and looked at the initials D.H. on it.",
    "Expensive bit of\nwork he said to Sergeant Graves.",
    "Not mass produced.",
    "Quite easily\nidentified.",
    "Greatorex or one of those Bond Street places.",
    "Have it seen\nto\n\nYes sir.",
    "Then the Superintendent looked at the wristwatch  the glass was\nsmashed and the hands pointed to ten minutes past nine.",
    "He looked at the Sergeant.",
    "Got the report on this.",
    "Graves\n\nYes sir.",
    "Mainsprings broken.",
    "And the mechanism of the hands\n\nQuite all right sir.",
    "What in your opinion.",
    "Graves does the watch tell us\n\nGraves murmured warily Seems as though it might give us the time\nthe crime was committed.",
    "Ah said Spence when youve been as long in the Force as I have\nyoull be a little suspicious of anything so convenient as a smashed\nwatch.",
    "It can be genuine  but its a wellknown hoary old trick.",
    "Turn\nthe hands of a watch to a time that suits you  smash it  and out with\n\n\fsome virtuous alibi.",
    "But you dont catch an old bird that way.",
    "Im\nkeeping a very open mind on the subject of the time this crime was\ncommitted.",
    "Medical evidence is between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.",
    "Sergeant Graves cleared his throat.",
    "Edwards second gardener at Furrowbank says he saw David Hunter\ncoming out of a side door there about 7.30.",
    "The maids didnt know he\nwas down here.",
    "They thought he was up in London with Mrs Gordon.",
    "Shows he was in the neighbourhood all right.",
    "Yes said Spence.",
    "Ill be interested to hear Hunters own account of\nhis doings.",
    "Seems like a clear case sir said Graves looking at the initials on\nthe lighter.",
    "Hm said the Superintendent.",
    "Theres still this to account for.",
    "He indicated the lipstick.",
    "It had rolled under the chest of drawers sir.",
    "Might have been there\nsome time.",
    "Ive checked up said Spence.",
    "The last time a woman occupied that\nroom was three weeks ago.",
    "I know service isnt up to much nowadays but I still think they run a mop under the furniture once in three weeks.",
    "The Stag is kept pretty clean and tidy on the whole.",
    "Theres been no suggestion of a woman being mixed up with Arden.",
    "I know said the Superintendent.",
    "Thats why that lipstick is what I\ncall the unknown quantity.",
    "Sergeant Graves refrained from saying Cherchez la femme.",
    "He had a\nvery good French accent and he knew better than to irritate\nSuperintendent Spence by drawing attention to it.",
    "Sergeant Graves\nwas a tactful young man.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nSuperintendent Spence looked up at Shepherds Court Mayfair\nbefore stepping inside its agreeable portal.",
    "Situated modestly in the\nvicinity of Shepherds Market it was discreet expensive and\ninconspicuous.",
    "Inside Spences feet sunk into soft pile carpet there was a velvet\ncovered settee and a jardiniere full of flowering plants.",
    "A small automatic lift faced him with a flight of stairs at one side of it.",
    "On the right of the hall was a door marked Office.",
    "Spence pushed it open and went through.",
    "He found himself in a small room with a counter behind which was a\ntable and a typewriter and two chairs.",
    "One was drawn up to the table\nthe other a more decorative one was set at an angle to the window.",
    "There was no one visible.",
    "Spying a bell inset on the mahogany counter Spence pressed it.",
    "When\nnothing happened he pressed it again.",
    "A minute or so later a door in\nthe far wall was opened and a resplendent person in uniform\nappeared.",
    "His appearance was that of a foreign General or possibly\nField Marshal but his speech was of London and uneducated London\nat that.",
    "Yes sir\n\nMrs Gordon Cloade.",
    "Third floor sir.",
    "Shall I ring through first\n\nShes here is she said Spence.",
    "I had an idea she might be in the\ncountry.",
    "No sir shes been here since Saturday last.",
    "And Mr David Hunter\n\nMr Hunters been here too.",
    "Hes not been away\n\nNo sir.",
    "Was he here last night\n\nNow then said the Field Marshal suddenly becoming aggressive.",
    "Whats all this about Want to know every ones life history\n\n\fSilently Spence displayed his warrant card.",
    "The Field Marshal was\nimmediately deflated and became cooperative.",
    "Sorry Im sure he said.",
    "Couldnt tell could I\n\nNow then was Mr Hunter here last night\n\nYes sir he was.",
    "At least to the best of my belief he was.",
    "That is he\ndidnt say he was going away.",
    "Would you know if he was away\n\nWell generally speaking no.",
    "I dont suppose I should.",
    "Gentlemen and\nladies usually say if theyre not going to be here.",
    "Leave word about\nletters or what they want said if any one rings up.",
    "Do telephone calls go through this office\n\nNo most of the flats have their own lines.",
    "One or two prefer not to\nhave a telephone and then we send up word on the house phone and\nthe people come down and speak from the box in the hall.",
    "But Mrs Cloades flat has its own phone\n\nYes sir.",
    "And as far as you know they were both here last night\n\nThats right.",
    "What about meals\n\nTheres a restaurant but Mrs Cloade and Mr Hunter dont very often\nuse it.",
    "They usually go out to dinner.",
    "Breakfast\n\nThats served in the flats.",
    "Can you find out if breakfast was served this morning to them\n\nYes sir.",
    "I can find out from room service.",
    "Spence nodded.",
    "Im going up now.",
    "Let me know about that when I\ncome down.",
    "Very good sir.",
    "Spence entered the lift and pressed the button for the third floor.",
    "There were only two flats on each landing.",
    "Spence pushed the bell of\nNo.",
    "9.",
    "David Hunter opened it.",
    "He did not know the Superintendent by sight\nand he spoke brusquely.",
    "Well what is it\n\nMr Hunter\n\n\fYes.",
    "Superintendent Spence of the Oatshire County Police.",
    "Can I have a\nword with you\n\nI apologise Superintendent.",
    "He grinned.",
    "I thought you were a tout.",
    "Come in.",
    "He led the way into a modern and charming room.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade\nwas standing by the window and turned at their entrance.",
    "Superintendent\n\nSpence\n\nRosaleen\n\nsaid\n\nHunter.",
    "Sit\n\ndown\n\nSuperintendent.",
    "Have a drink\n\nNo thank you Mr Hunter.",
    "Rosaleen had inclined her head slightly.",
    "She sat now her back to the\nwindow her hands clasped tightly on her lap.",
    "Smoke David preferred cigarettes.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Spence took a cigarette waited... watched David slide a\nhand into a pocket slide it out frown look round and pick up a box of\nmatches.",
    "He struck one and lit the Superintendents cigarette.",
    "Thank you sir.",
    "Well said David easily as he lit his own cigarette.",
    "Whats wrong at\nWarmsley Vale Has our cook been dealing in the Black Market She\n\n\fprovides us with wonderful food and Ive always wondered if there\nwas some sinister story behind it.",
    "Its rather more serious than that said the Superintendent.",
    "A man\ndied at the Stag Inn last night.",
    "Perhaps you saw it in the papers\n\nDavid shook his head.",
    "No I didnt notice it.",
    "What about him\n\nHe didnt only die.",
    "He was killed.",
    "His head was smote in as a matter of\nfact.",
    "A halfchoked exclamation came from Rosaleen.",
    "David said quickly\n\nPlease Superintendent dont enlarge on any details.",
    "My sister is\ndelicate.",
    "She cant help it but if you mention blood and horrors shell\nprobably faint.",
    "Oh Im sorry said the Superintendent.",
    "But there wasnt any blood\nto speak of.",
    "It was murder right enough though.",
    "He paused.",
    "Davids eyebrows went up.",
    "He said gently\n\nYou interest me.",
    "Where do we come in\n\nWe hoped you might be able to tell us something about this man Mr\nHunter.",
    "I\n\nYou called to see him on Saturday evening last.",
    "His name  or the\nname he was registered under  was Enoch Arden.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "I remember now.",
    "David spoke quietly without embarrassment.",
    "Well Mr Hunter\n\nWell Superintendent Im afraid I cant help you.",
    "I know next to\nnothing about the man.",
    "Was his name really Enoch Arden\n\nI should very much doubt it.",
    "Why did you go to see him\n\nJust one of the usual hard luck stories.",
    "He mentioned certain places\nwar experiences people  David shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Just a\ntouch Im afraid.",
    "The whole thing was rather bogus.",
    "Did you give him any money sir\n\nThere was a fractional pause and then David said\n\nJust a fiver  for luck.",
    "Hed been in the war all right.",
    "He mentioned certain names that you knew\n\nYes.",
    "Was one of those names Captain Robert Underhay\n\nNow at last he got his effect.",
    "David stiffened.",
    "Behind him Rosaleen\ngave a little frightened gasp.",
    "What makes you think that Superintendent David asked at last.",
    "His\neyes were cautious probing.",
    "Information received said the Superintendent stolidly.",
    "There was a short silence.",
    "The Superintendent was aware of Davids\neyes studying him sizing him up striving to know...",
    "He himself waited\nquietly.",
    "Any idea who Robert Underhay was Superintendent David asked.",
    "Suppose you tell me sir.",
    "Robert Underhay was my sisters first husband.",
    "He died in Africa\nsome years ago.",
    "Quite sure of that Mr Hunter\n\nSpence asked quickly.",
    "Quite sure.",
    "Thats so isnt it Rosaleen\n\nHe turned to her.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "She spoke quickly and breathlessly.",
    "Robert died of fever blackwater fever.",
    "It was very sad.",
    "Sometimes stories get about that arent quite true Mrs Cloade.",
    "She said nothing.",
    "She was looking not at him but at her brother.",
    "Then\nafter a moment she said\n\nRoberts dead.",
    "From information in my possession said the Superintendent I\nunderstand that this man Enoch Arden claimed to be a friend of the\nlate Robert Underhay and at the same time informed you Mr Hunter\nthat Robert Underhay was alive.",
    "David shook his head.",
    "Nonsense he said.",
    "Absolute nonsense.",
    "You state definitely that the name of Robert Underhay was not\nmentioned\n\nOh David smiled charmingly it was mentioned.",
    "This poor fellow\nhad known Underhay.",
    "There was no question of  blackmail Mr Hunter\n\n\fBlackmail I dont understand you Superintendent.",
    "Dont you really Mr Hunter By the way just as a matter of form\nwhere were you last night  between shall we say seven and eleven\n\nJust as a matter of form Superintendent suppose I refuse to\nanswer\n\nArent you behaving rather childishly Mr Hunter\n\nI dont think so.",
    "I dislike  I always have disliked being bullied.",
    "The Superintendent thought that was probably true.",
    "Hed known witnesses of the David Hunter type before.",
    "Witnesses who\nwere obstructive for the sake of being obstructive and not in the least\nbecause they had anything to hide.",
    "The mere fact of being asked to\naccount for their comings and goings seemed to raise a black pride\nand sullenness in them.",
    "They would make it a point to give the law all\nthe trouble they could.",
    "Superintendent Spence though he prided himself on being a fairminded man had nevertheless come to Shepherds Court with a very\nstrong conviction that David Hunter was a murderer.",
    "Now for the first time he was not so sure.",
    "The very puerility of Davids\ndefiance awoke doubts in him.",
    "Spence looked at Rosaleen Cloade.",
    "She responded at once.",
    "David why dont you tell him\n\nThats right Mrs Cloade.",
    "We only want to clear things up \n\nDavid broke in savagely\n\nYoull stop bullying my sister do you hear What is it to you where I\nmay have been here or at Warmsley Vale or in Timbuctoo\n\nSpence said warningly\n\nYoull be subpoenaed for the Inquest Mr Hunter and there youll have\nto answer questions.",
    "Ill wait for the Inquest then And now Superintendent will you get to\nhell out of here\n\nVery good sir.",
    "The Superintendent rose imperturbable.",
    "But Ive\nsomething to ask Mrs Cloade first.",
    "I dont want my sister worried.",
    "Quite so.",
    "But I want her to look at the body and tell me if she can\nidentify it.",
    "Im within my rights there.",
    "Itll have to be done sooner or\nlater.",
    "Why not let her come down with me now and get it over The late\nMr Arden was heard by a witness to say that he knew Robert Underhay\n ergo he may have known Mrs Underhay  and therefore Mrs Underhay\nmay know him.",
    "If his name isnt Enoch Arden we could do with\nknowing what it really is.",
    "Rather unexpectedly Rosaleen Cloade got up.",
    "Ill come of course she said.",
    "Spence expected a fresh outburst from David but to his surprise the\nother grinned.",
    "Good for you Rosaleen he said.",
    "Ill confess Im curious myself.",
    "After all you may be able to put a name to the fellow.",
    "Spence said to her\n\nYou didnt see him yourself in Warmsley Vale\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "Ive been in London since Saturday last.",
    "And Arden arrived on Friday night  yes.",
    "Rosaleen asked Do you want me to come now\n\nShe asked the question with something of the submissiveness of a little\ngirl.",
    "In spite of himself the Superintendent was favourably impressed.",
    "There was a docility a willingness about her which he had not\nexpected.",
    "That would be very nice of you Mrs Cloade he said.",
    "The sooner we\ncan get certain facts definitely established the better.",
    "I havent got a\npolice car here Im afraid.",
    "David crossed to the telephone.",
    "Ill ring up the Daimler Hire.",
    "Its beyond the legal limit  but I expect\nyou can square that Superintendent.",
    "I think that can be arranged Mr Hunter.",
    "He got up.",
    "Ill be waiting for\nyou downstairs.",
    "He went down in the lift and pushed open the office door once more.",
    "The Field Marshal was awaiting him.",
    "Well\n\nBoth beds slept in last night sir.",
    "Baths and towels used.",
    "Breakfast\nwas served to them in the flat at ninethirty.",
    "And you dont know what time Mr Hunter came in yesterday\nevening\n\nI cant tell you anything further Im afraid sir\n\nWell that was that Spence thought.",
    "He wondered if there was anything behind Davids refusal to speak\nexcept pure childlike defiance.",
    "He must realise that a charge of\n\n\fmurder was hovering over him.",
    "Surely he must see that the sooner he\ntold his story the better.",
    "Never a good thing to antagonise the police.",
    "But antagonising the police he thought ruefully was just what David\nHunter would enjoy doing.",
    "They talked very little on the way down.",
    "When they arrived at the\nmortuary Rosaleen Cloade was very pale.",
    "Her hands were shaking.",
    "David looked concerned for her.",
    "He spoke to her as though she was a\nsmall child.",
    "Itll be only a minute or two Rosaleen.",
    "Its nothing at all nothing at all\nnow.",
    "Dont get worked up.",
    "You go in with the Superintendent and Ill\nwait for you.",
    "And theres nothing at all to mind about.",
    "Peaceful hell\nlook and just as though he were asleep.",
    "She gave him a little nod of the head and stretched out her hand.",
    "He\ngave it a little squeeze.",
    "Be a brave girl now alanna.",
    "As she followed the Superintendent she said in her soft voice You\nmust think Im a terrible coward.",
    "Superintendent.",
    "But when theyve\nbeen all dead in the house  all dead but you  that awful night in\nLondon \n\nHe said gently I understand Mrs Cloade.",
    "I know you went through a\nbad experience in the Blitz when your husband was killed.",
    "Really it will\nbe only a minute or two.",
    "At a sign from Spence the sheet was turned back.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade\nstood looking down at the man who had called himself Enoch Arden.",
    "Spence unobtrusively standing to one side was actually watching her\nclosely.",
    "She looked at the dead man curiously and as though wondering  she\ngave no start no sign of emotion or recognition just looked long and\nwonderingly at him.",
    "Then very quietly in an almost matter of fact way she made the sign\nof the cross.",
    "God rest his soul she said.",
    "Ive never seen that man in my life.",
    "I\ndont know who he is.",
    "Spence thought to himself\n\nEither youre one of the finest actresses Ive ever known or else\nyoure speaking the truth.",
    "Later Spence rang up Rowley Cloade.",
    "Ive had the widow down he said.",
    "She says definitely that hes not\nRobert Underhay and that shes never seen him before.",
    "So that settles\nthat\n\nThere was a pause.",
    "Then Rowley said slowly\n\nDoes it settle it\n\n\fI think a jury would believe her  in the absence of evidence to the\ncontrary of course.",
    "Yees said Rowley and rang off.",
    "Then frowning he picked up not the local telephone directory but the\nLondon one.",
    "His forefingers ran methodically down the letter P.\nPresently he found what he wanted.",
    "BOOK II\n\nChapter 1\n\nHercule Poirot carefully folded the last of the newspapers he had sent\nGeorge out to purchase.",
    "The information they gave was somewhat\nmeagre.",
    "Medical evidence was given that the mans skull was\nfractured by a series of heavy blows.",
    "The inquest had been adjourned\nfor a fortnight.",
    "Anybody who could give information about a man\nnamed Enoch Arden believed to have lately arrived from Cape Town\nwas asked to communicate with the Chief Constable of Oatshire.",
    "Poirot laid the papers in a neat pile and gave himself up to meditation.",
    "He was interested.",
    "He might perhaps have passed the first small\nparagraph by without interest if it had not been for the recent visit of\nMrs Lionel Cloade.",
    "But that visit had recalled to him very clearly the\nincidents of that day at the Club during that Air Raid.",
    "He remembered\nvery distinctly Major Porters voice saying Maybe a Mr Enoch Arden\nwill turn up somewhere a thousand miles away and start life anew.",
    "He\nwanted now rather badly to know more about this man called Enoch\nArden who had died by violence at Warmsley Vale.",
    "He remembered that he was slightly acquainted with Superintendent\nSpence of the Oatshire police and he also remembered that young\nMellon lived not very far from Warmsley Heath and that young Mellon\nknew Jeremy Cloade.",
    "It was while he was meditating a telephone call to young Mellon that\nGeorge came in and announced that a Mr Rowland Cloade would like\nto see him.",
    "Aha said Hercule Poirot with satisfaction.",
    "Show him in.",
    "A goodlooking worried young man was shown in and seemed rather\nat a loss how to begin.",
    "Well Mr Cloade said Poirot helpfully and what can I do for you\n\nRowley Cloade was eyeing Poirot rather doubtfully.",
    "The flamboyant\nmoustaches the sartorial elegance the white spats and the pointed\npatent leather shoes all filled this insular young man with distinct\nmisgivings.",
    "Poirot realised this perfectly well and was somewhat amused.",
    "Rowley Cloade began rather heavily\n\nIm afraid Ill have to explain who I am and all that.",
    "You wont know my\nname \n\nPoirot interrupted him\n\n\fBut yes I know your name perfectly.",
    "Your aunt you see came to see\nme last week.",
    "My aunt Rowleys jaw dropped.",
    "He stared at Poirot with the utmost astonishment.",
    "This so clearly was news to him that Poirot put aside his first surmise\nwhich was that the two visits were connected.",
    "For a moment it seemed to him a remarkable coincidence that two\nmembers of the Cloade family should choose to consult him within\nsuch a short period of time but a second later he realised that there\nwas no coincidence  merely a natural sequence proceeding from one\ninitial cause.",
    "Aloud he said\n\nI assume that Mrs Lionel Cloade is your aunt.",
    "If anything Rowley looked rather more astonished than before.",
    "He said with the utmost incredulity\n\nAunt Kathie Surely  dont you mean  Mrs Jeremy Cloade\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "But what on earth could Aunt Kathie \n\n\fPoirot murmured discreetly\n\nShe was directed to me I understand by spirit guidance.",
    "Oh Lord said Rowley.",
    "He looked relieved and amused.",
    "He said as\nthough reassuring Poirot Shes quite harmless you know.",
    "I wonder said Poirot.",
    "What do you mean\n\nIs anybody  ever  quite harmless\n\nRowley stared.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "You have come to me to ask me something  Yes he prompted\ngently.",
    "The worried look came back to Rowleys face.",
    "Its rather a long story Im afraid \n\nPoirot was afraid of it too.",
    "He had a very shrewd idea that Rowley\nCloade was not the sort of person to come to the point quickly.",
    "He\nleaned back and half closed his eyes as Rowley began\n\nMy uncle you see was Gordon Cloade \n\nI know all about Gordon Cloade said Poirot helpfully.",
    "Good.",
    "Then I neednt explain.",
    "He married a few weeks before his\ndeath  a young widow called Underhay.",
    "Since his death she has been\nliving at Warmsley Vale  she and a brother of hers.",
    "We all understood\nthat her first husband had died of fever in Africa.",
    "But now it seems as\nthough that mightnt be so.",
    "Ah Poirot sat up.",
    "And what has led you to that surmise\n\nRowley described the advent of Mr Enoch Arden in Warmsley Vale.",
    "Perhaps you have seen in the papers \n\nYes I have seen.",
    "Poirot was again helpful.",
    "Rowley went on.",
    "He described his first impression of the man Arden\nhis visit to the Stag the letter he had received from Beatrice Lippincott\nand finally the conversation that Beatrice had overheard.",
    "Of course Rowley said one cant be sure just what she did hear.",
    "She may have exaggerated it all a bit  or even got it wrong.",
    "Has she told her story to the police\n\nRowley nodded.",
    "I told her shed better.",
    "I dont quite see  pardon me  why you come to me Mr Cloade Do\nyou want me to investigate this  murder For it is murder I assume.",
    "Lord no said Rowley.",
    "I dont want anything of that kind.",
    "Thats a\npolice job.",
    "He was bumped off all right.",
    "No what Im after is this.",
    "I want\nyou to find out who the fellow was.",
    "Poirots eyes narrowed.",
    "Who do you think he was Mr Cloade\n\nWell I mean  Enoch Arden isnt a name.",
    "Dash it all its a quotation.",
    "Tennyson.",
    "I went and mugged it up.",
    "Fellow who comes back and finds\nout his wife has married another fellow.",
    "So you think said Poirot quietly that Enoch Arden was Robert\nUnderhay himself\n\nRowley said slowly\n\nWell he might have been  I mean about the right age and\nappearance and all that.",
    "Of course Ive gone over it all with Beatrice\nagain and again.",
    "She cant naturally remember exactly what they both\nsaid.",
    "The chap said Robert Underhay had come down in the world and\nwas in bad health and needed money.",
    "Well he might have been talking\nabout himself mightnt he He seems to have said something about it\nwouldnt suit David Hunters book if Underhay turned up in Warmsley\nVale  sounding a bit as though he was there under an assumed name.",
    "What evidence of identification was there at the Inquest\n\nRowley shook his head.",
    "Nothing definite.",
    "Only the Stag people saying he was the man whod\ncome there and registered as Enoch Arden.",
    "What about his papers\n\nHe hadnt any.",
    "What Poirot sat up in surprise.",
    "No papers of any kind\n\nNothing at all.",
    "Some spare socks and a shirt and a toothbrush etc.",
    "but no papers.",
    "No passport No letters Not even a ration card\n\nNothing at all.",
    "That said Poirot is very interesting.",
    "Yes very interesting.",
    "Rowley went on David Hunter thats Rosaleen Cloades brother had\ncalled to see him the evening after he arrived.",
    "His story to the police is\nthat hed had a letter from the chap saying he had been a friend of\nRobert Underhays and was down and out.",
    "At his sisters request he\nwent to the Stag and saw the fellow and gave him a fiver.",
    "Thats his\nstory and you bet he means to stick to it Of course the police are\nkeeping dark about what Beatrice heard.",
    "David Hunter says he had no previous acquaintance with the man\n\nThats what he says.",
    "Anyway I gather Hunter never met Underhay.",
    "And what about Rosaleen Cloade\n\nThe police asked her to look at the body in case she knew the man.",
    "She told them that he was a complete stranger to her.",
    "Eh bien said Piorot.",
    "Then that answers your question\n\nDoes it said Rowley bluntly.",
    "I think not.",
    "If the dead man is\nUnderhay then Rosaleen was never my uncles wife and shes not\nentitled to a penny of his money.",
    "Do you think she would recognise him\nunder those circumstances\n\nYou dont trust her\n\nI dont trust either of them.",
    "Surely there are plenty of people who could say for certain that the\ndead man is or is not Underhay\n\nIt doesnt seem to be so easy.",
    "Thats what I want you to do.",
    "Find\nsomeone who knows Underhay.",
    "Apparently he has no living relations\nin this country  and he was always an unsociable lonely sort of chap.",
    "I\nsuppose there must be old servants  friends  someone  but the wars\nbroken up everything and shifted people round.",
    "I wouldnt know how to\nbegin to tackle the job  anyway I havent the time.",
    "Im a farmer  and\nIm shorthanded.",
    "Why me said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Rowley looked embarrassed.",
    "A faint twinkle came into Poirots eye.",
    "Spirit guidance he murmured.",
    "Good Lord no said Rowley horrified.",
    "Matter of fact he hesitated I heard a fellow I know talk about you said you were a wizard at these sort of things.",
    "I dont know about your\nfees  expensive I expect  were rather a stonybroke lot but I dare\nsay we could cough it up amongst the lot of us.",
    "That is if youll take it\non.",
    "Hercule Poirot said slowly\n\nYes I think perhaps I can help you.",
    "His memory a very precise and definite memory went back.",
    "The club\nbore the rustling newspapers the monotonous voice.",
    "The name  he had heard the name  it would come back to him\npresently.",
    "If not he could always ask Mellon... No he had got it.",
    "Porter.",
    "Major Porter.",
    "Hercule Poirot rose to his feet.",
    "Will you come back here this afternoon Mr Cloade\n\nWell  I dont know.",
    "Yes I suppose I could.",
    "But surely you cant do\nanything in that short time\n\n\fHe looked at Poirot with awe and incredulity.",
    "Poirot would have been\nless than human if he could have resisted the temptation to show off.",
    "With memories of a brilliant predecessor in his mind he said solemnly\n\nI have my methods Mr Cloade.",
    "It was clearly the right thing to say.",
    "Rowleys expression became\nrespectful in the extreme.",
    "Yes  of course  really  I dont know how you people do these things.",
    "Poirot did not enlighten him.",
    "When Rowley had gone he sat down and\nwrote a short note.",
    "Giving it to George he instructed him to take it to\nthe Coronation Club and wait for an answer.",
    "The answer was highly satisfactory.",
    "Major Porter presented his compliments to M. Hercule Poirot and\nwould be happy to see him and his friend at 79 Edgeway Street\nCampden Hill that afternoon at five oclock.",
    "At fourthirty Rowley Cloade reappeared.",
    "Any luck M. Poirot\n\nBut yes Mr Cloade we go now to see an old friend of Captain Robert\nUnderhays.",
    "What Rowleys mouth fell open.",
    "He stared at Poirot with the\namazement a small boy shows when a conjurer produces rabbits out\nof a hat.",
    "But its incredible I dont understand how you can do these\nthings  why its only a few hours.",
    "Poirot waved a deprecating hand and tried to look modest.",
    "He had no\nintention of revealing the simplicity with which his conjuring trick had\nbeen done.",
    "His vanity was pleased to impress this simple Rowley.",
    "The two men went out together and hailing a taxi they drove to\nCampden Hill.",
    "Major Porter had the first floor of a small shabby house.",
    "They were\nadmitted by a cheerful blowsylooking woman who took them up.",
    "It\nwas a square room with bookshelves round it and some rather bad\nsporting prints.",
    "There were two rugs on the floor  good rugs with\nlovely dim colour but very worn.",
    "Poirot noticed that the centre of the\nfloor was covered with a new heavy varnish whereas the varnish round\nthe edge was old and rubbed.",
    "He realised then that there had been\nother better rugs until recently  rugs that were worth good money in\nthese days.",
    "He looked up at the man standing erect by the fireplace in\nhis wellcut shabby suit.",
    "Poirot guessed that for Major Porter retired Army officer life was\nlived very near the bone.",
    "Taxation and increased cost of living struck\nhardest at the old warhorses.",
    "Some things he guessed Major Porter would cling to until the end.",
    "His\nclub subscription for instance.",
    "Major Porter was speaking jerkily.",
    "Fraid I dont remember meeting you M. Poirot.",
    "At the club you say\nCouple of years ago Know your name of course.",
    "This said Poirot is Mr Rowland Cloade.",
    "Major Porter jerked his head in honour of the introduction.",
    "How dye do he said.",
    "Fraid I cant ask you to have a glass of\nsherry.",
    "Matter of fact my wine merchant has lost his stock in the Blitz.",
    "Got some gin.",
    "Filthy stuff I always think.",
    "Or what about some beer\n\nThey accepted beer.",
    "Major Porter produced a cigarette case.",
    "Smoke Poirot accepted a cigarette.",
    "The Major struck a match and\nlighted Poirots cigarette.",
    "You dont I know said the Major to Rowley.",
    "Mind if I light my pipe\n\nHe did so with a great deal of sucking and blowing.",
    "Now then he said when all these preliminaries had been\naccomplished.",
    "Whats all this about\n\nHe looked from one to the other of them.",
    "Poirot said You may have read in the paper of the death of a man at\nWarmsley Vale\n\nPorter shook his head.",
    "May have.",
    "Dont think so.",
    "His name was Arden.",
    "Enoch Arden\n\nPorter still shook his head.",
    "He was found at the Stag Inn with the back of his head smashed in.",
    "Porter frowned.",
    "Let me see  yes did see something about it I believe  some days\nago.",
    "Yes.",
    "I have here a photograph  it is a press photograph and not very\nclear Im afraid What we should like to know Major Porter is whether\nyou have ever seen this man before\n\nHe handed over the best reproduction of the dead mans face he had\nbeen able to find.",
    "Major Porter took it and frowned at it.",
    "Wait a sec.",
    "The Major took out his spectacles adjusted them on his\nnose and studied the photograph more closely  then he gave a sudden\nstart.",
    "God bless my soul he said.",
    "Well Im damned\n\nYou know the man Major\n\n\fOf course I know him.",
    "Its Underhay  Robert Underhay.",
    "Youre sure of that There was triumph in Rowleys voice.",
    "Of course Im sure.",
    "Robert Underhay Id swear to it anywhere.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nThe telephone rang and Lynn went to answer it.",
    "Rowleys voice spoke.",
    "Lynn\n\nRowley\n\nHer voice sounded depressed.",
    "He said\n\nWhat are you up to I never see you these days.",
    "Oh well  its all chores  you know.",
    "Running round with a basket\nwaiting for fish and queueing up for a bit of quite disgusting cake.",
    "All\nthat sort of thing.",
    "Home life.",
    "I want to see you.",
    "Ive got something to tell you.",
    "What sort of thing\n\nHe gave a chuckle.",
    "Good news.",
    "Meet me by Rolland Copse.",
    "Were ploughing up there.",
    "Good news Lynn put the receiver down.",
    "What to Rowley Cloade\nwould be good news Finance Had he sold that young bull at a better\nprice than he had hoped to get\n\nNo she thought it must be more than that.",
    "As she walked up the field\nto Rolland Copse Rowley left the tractor and came to meet her.",
    "Hallo Lynn.",
    "Why Rowley  you look  different somehow\n\nHe laughed.",
    "I should think I do.",
    "Our lucks turned Lynn\n\nWhat do you mean\n\nDo you remember old Jeremy mentioning a chap called Hercule\nPoirot\n\nHercule Poirot Lynn frowned.",
    "Yes I do remember something \n\nQuite a long time ago.",
    "When the war was on.",
    "They were in that\nmausoleum of a club of his and there was an Air Raid.",
    "Well Lynn demanded impatiently.",
    "Fellow has the wrong clothes and all that.",
    "French chap  or Belgian.",
    "Queer fellow but hes the goods all right.",
    "Lynn knit her brows.",
    "Wasnt he  a detective\n\nThats right.",
    "Well you know this fellow who was done in at the Stag.",
    "I\ndidnt tell you but an idea was getting around that he might just\npossibly be Rosaleen Cloades first husband.",
    "Lynn laughed.",
    "Simply because he called himself Enoch Arden What an absurd\nidea\n\nNot so absurd my girl.",
    "Old Spence got Rosaleen down to have a look\nat him.",
    "And she swore quite firmly that he wasnt her husband.",
    "So that finished it\n\nIt might have said Rowley.",
    "But for me\n\nFor you What did you do\n\nI went to this fellow Hercule Poirot.",
    "I told him we wanted another\nopinion.",
    "Could he rustle up someone who had actually known Robert\nUnderhay My word but hes absolutely wizard that chap Just like\nrabbits out of a hat.",
    "He produced a fellow who was Underhays best\nfriend in a few hours.",
    "Old boy called Porter.",
    "Rowley stopped.",
    "Then he chuckled again with that note of excitement\nthat had surprised and startled Lynn.",
    "Now keep this under your hat\nLynn.",
    "The Super swore me to secrecy  but Id like you to know.",
    "The\ndead man is Robert Underhay.",
    "What Lynn took a step back.",
    "She stared at Rowley blankly.",
    "Robert Underhay himself.",
    "Porter hadnt the least doubt.",
    "So you see\nLynn  Rowleys voice rose excitedly  weve won After all weve\nwon Weve beaten those damned crooks\n\nWhat damned crooks\n\nHunter and his sister.",
    "Theyre licked  out of it.",
    "Rosaleen doesnt get\nGordons money.",
    "We get it.",
    "Its ours Gordons will that he made before\nhe married Rosaleen holds good and that divides it amongst us.",
    "I get a\nfourth share.",
    "See If her first husband was alive when she married\nGordon she was never married to Gordon at all\n\nAre you  are you sure of what youre saying\n\nHe stared at her for the first time he looked faintly puzzled.",
    "Of course Im sure Its elementary.",
    "Everythings all right now.",
    "Its the\nsame as Gordon meant it to be.",
    "Everythings the same as if that\nprecious pair had never butted in.",
    "Everythings the same.",
    "But you couldnt Lynn thought wash out like\nthat something that had happened.",
    "You couldnt pretend that it had\nnever been.",
    "She said slowly\n\nWhat will they do\n\nEh She saw that until that moment Rowley had hardly considered\nthat question.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Go back where they came from I suppose.",
    "I think you\nknow  She could see him slowly following it out.",
    "Yes I think we\nought to do something for her.",
    "I mean she married Gordon in all good\nfaith.",
    "I gather she really believed her first husband was dead.",
    "Its not\nher fault.",
    "Yes we must do something about her  give her a decent\nallowance.",
    "Make it up between us all.",
    "You like her dont you said Lynn.",
    "Well yes.",
    "He considered.",
    "I do in a way.",
    "Shes a nice kid.",
    "She knows\na cow when she sees it.",
    "I dont said Lynn.",
    "Oh youll learn said Rowley kindly.",
    "And what about  David asked Lynn.",
    "Rowley scowled.",
    "To hell with David It was never his money anyway.",
    "He just came\nalong and sponged on his sister.",
    "No Rowley it wasnt like that  it wasnt.",
    "Hes not a sponger.",
    "Hes hes an adventurer perhaps \n\nAnd a ruddy murderer\n\nShe said breathlessly\n\nWhat do you mean\n\nWell who do you think killed Underhay\n\nShe cried\n\nI dont believe it I dont believe it\n\nOf course he killed Underhay Who else could have done it He was\ndown here that day.",
    "Came down by the fivethirty.",
    "I was meeting some\nstuff at the station and caught sight of him in the distance.",
    "Lynn said sharply\n\nHe went back to London that evening.",
    "After having killed Underhay said Rowley triumphantly.",
    "You oughtnt to say things like that Rowley.",
    "What time was Underhay\nkilled\n\n\fWell  I dont know exactly.",
    "Rowley slowed up  considered.",
    "Dont\nsuppose we shall know until the Inquest tomorrow.",
    "Some time\nbetween nine and ten I imagine.",
    "David caught the ninetwenty train back to London.",
    "Look here Lynn how do you know\n\nI  I met him  he was running for it.",
    "How do you know he ever caught it\n\nBecause he telephoned me from London later.",
    "Rowley scowled angrily.",
    "What the hell should he telephone you for Look here Lynn Im\ndamned if I \n\nOh what does it matter Rowley Anyway it shows he caught that\ntrain.",
    "Plenty of time to have killed Underhay and then run for the train.",
    "Not if he was killed after nine oclock.",
    "Well he may have been killed just before nine.",
    "But his voice was a little doubtful.",
    "Lynn halfclosed her eyes.",
    "Was that\nthe truth of it When breathless swearing David had emerged from\nthe copse had it been a murderer fresh from his crime who had taken\nher in his arms She remembered his curious excitement  the\nrecklessness of his mood Was that the way that murder would affect\nhim It might.",
    "She had to admit it.",
    "Were David and murder so far\nremoved from each other Would he kill a man who had never done\nhim any harm  a ghost from the past A man whose only crime was to\nstand between Rosaleen and a big inheritance  between David and the\nenjoyment of Rosaleens money.",
    "She murmured\n\nWhy should he kill Underhay\n\nMy God Lynn can you ask Ive just told you Underhays being alive\nmeans that we get Gordons money Anyway Underhay was\nblackmailing him.",
    "Ah that fell more into the pattern.",
    "David might kill a blackmailer  in\nfact wasnt it just the way he would deal with a blackmailer Yes it all\nfell into pattern.",
    "Davids haste his excitement  his fierce almost\nangry lovemaking.",
    "And later his renouncement of her.",
    "Id better\nclear out...",
    "Yes it fitted.",
    "From a long way away she heard Rowleys voice asking\n\nWhats the matter Lynn Are you feeling all right\n\nYes of course.",
    "Well for heavens sake dont look so glum.",
    "He turned looking down\nthe hillside to Long Willows.",
    "Thank goodness we can have the place\nsmartened up a bit now  get some laboursaving gadgets put in  make\nit right for you.",
    "I dont want you to pig it Lynn.",
    "That was to be her home  that house.",
    "Her home with Rowley...\n\nAnd one morning at eight oclock David would swing by the neck until\nhe was dead...\n\nChapter 3\n\nWith a pale determined face and watchful eyes David had his hands\non Rosaleens shoulders.",
    "It will be all right Im telling you it will be all right.",
    "But you must keep\nyour head and do exactly as I tell you.",
    "And if they take you away You said that You did say that they might\ntake you away.",
    "Its a possibility yes.",
    "But it wont be for long.",
    "Not if you keep your\nhead.",
    "Ill do what you tell me David.",
    "Theres the girl All you have to do Rosaleen is to stick to your story.",
    "Hold to it that the dead man is not your husband Robert Underhay.",
    "Theyll trap me into saying things I dont mean.",
    "No  they wont.",
    "Its all right I tell you.",
    "No its wrong  its been wrong all along.",
    "Taking money that doesnt\nbelong to us.",
    "I lie awake nights thinking of it David.",
    "Taking what\ndoesnt belong to us.",
    "God is punishing us for our wickedness.",
    "He looked at her frowning.",
    "She was cracking  yes definitely she was\ncracking.",
    "There had always been that religious streak.",
    "Her conscience had\nnever been quite stilled.",
    "Now unless he was extremely lucky shed\nbreak down completely.",
    "Well there was only one thing to be done.",
    "Listen Rosaleen he said gently.",
    "Do you want me to be hanged\n\nHer eyes widened in horror.",
    "Oh David you wouldnt  they couldnt \n\nTheres only one person who can hang me  thats you.",
    "If you once\nadmit by look or sign or word that the dead man might be Underhay\nyou put the rope round my neck Do you understand that\n\nYes that had got home.",
    "She gazed at him with wide horrified eyes.",
    "Im so stupid David.",
    "No youre not.",
    "In any case you havent got to be clever.",
    "Youll have to\nswear solemnly that the dead man is not your husband.",
    "You can do\nthat\n\nShe nodded.",
    "Look stupid if you like.",
    "Look as if you dont understand quite what\ntheyre asking you.",
    "That will do no harm.",
    "But stand firm on the points\nIve gone over with you.",
    "Gaythorne will look after you.",
    "Hes a very able\ncriminal lawyer  thats why Ive got him.",
    "Hell be at the Inquest and\nhell protect you from any heckling.",
    "But even to him stick to your story.",
    "For Gods sake dont try to be clever or think you can help me by some\nline of your own.",
    "Ill do it David.",
    "Ill do exactly what you tell me.",
    "Good girl.",
    "When its all over well go away  to the South of France  to\nAmerica.",
    "In the meantime take care of your health.",
    "Dont lie awake at\nnights fretting and working yourself up.",
    "Take those sleeping things Dr\nCloade prescribed for you  bromide or something.",
    "Take one every\nnight cheer up and remember theres a good time coming\n\nNow  he looked at his watch.",
    "Its time to go to the Inquest.",
    "Its\ncalled for eleven.",
    "He looked round the long beautiful drawingroom.",
    "Beauty comfort\nwealth...\n\nHed enjoyed it all.",
    "A fine house.",
    "Furrowbank.",
    "Perhaps this was Goodbye...\n\n\fHed got himself into a jam  that was certain.",
    "But even now he didnt\nregret.",
    "And for the future  well hed go on taking chances.",
    "And we\nmust take the current when it serves or lose our ventures.",
    "He looked\nat Rosaleen.",
    "She was watching him with large appealing eyes and\nintuitively he knew what she wanted.",
    "I didnt kill him Rosaleen he said gently.",
    "I swear it to you by every\nsaint in your calendar\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe inquest was held in the Cornmarket.",
    "The coroner Mr Pebmarsh was a small fussy man with glasses and a\nconsiderable sense of his own importance.",
    "Beside him sat the large bulk of Superintendent Spence.",
    "In an\nunobtrusive seat was a small foreignlooking man with a large black\nmoustache.",
    "The Cloade family the Jeremy Cloades the Lionel\nCloades Rowley Cloade Mrs Marchmont and Lynn  they were all\nthere.",
    "Major Porter sat by himself fidgeting and ill at ease.",
    "David and\nRosaleen arrived last.",
    "They sat by themselves.",
    "The coroner cleared his throat and glancing round the jury of nine\nlocal worthies started proceedings.",
    "Constable Peacock...",
    "Sergeant Vane...\n\n\fDr Lionel Cloade...\n\nYou were attending a patient professionally at the Stag when Gladys\nAitkin came to you.",
    "What did she say\n\nShe informed me that the occupant of No.",
    "5 was lying on the floor\ndead.",
    "In consequence you went up to No.",
    "5\n\nI did.",
    "Will you describe what you found there\n\nDr Cloade described.",
    "Body of a man... face downwards... head\ninjuries... back of skull... firetongs.",
    "You were of opinion that the injuries were inflicted with the tongs in\nquestion\n\nSome of them unquestionably were.",
    "And that several blows had been struck\n\nYes.",
    "I did not make a detailed examination as I considered that the\npolice should be called before the body was touched or its position\naltered.",
    "Very proper.",
    "The man was dead\n\n\fYes.",
    "He had been dead for some hours.",
    "How long in your opinion had he been dead\n\nI should hesitate to be very definite about that.",
    "At least eleven hours quite possibly thirteen or fourteen  let us say between 7.30 and 10.30\np.m. the preceding evening.",
    "Thank you Dr Cloade.",
    "Then came the police surgeon  giving a full and technical description\nof the wounds.",
    "There was an abrasion and swelling on the lower jaw\nand five or six blows had been struck on the base of the skull some of\nwhich had been delivered after death.",
    "It was an assault of great savagery\n\nExactly.",
    "Would great strength have been needed to inflict these blows\n\nNno not exactly strength.",
    "The tongs grasped by the pincers end\ncould be easily swung without much exertion.",
    "The heavy steel ball\nwhich forms the head of the tongs makes them a formidable weapon.",
    "Quite a delicate person could have inflicted the injuries if that is to\nsay they were struck in a frenzy of excitement.",
    "Thank you Doctor.",
    "Details as to the condition of the body followed  well nourished\nhealthy age about fortyfive.",
    "No signs of illness or disease  heart\nlungs etc.",
    "all good.",
    "Beatrice Lippincott gave evidence of the arrival of deceased.",
    "He had\nregistered as Enoch Arden Cape Town.",
    "Did deceased produce a ration book\n\nNo sir.",
    "Did you ask him for one\n\nNot at first.",
    "I did not know how long he was staying.",
    "But you did eventually ask him\n\nYes sir.",
    "He arrived on the Friday and on Saturday I said if he was\nstaying more than five days would he please let me have his ration\nbook.",
    "What did he say to that\n\nHe said he would give it to me.",
    "But he did not actually do so\n\nNo.",
    "He did not say that he had lost it Or had not got one\n\n\fOh no.",
    "He just said Ill look it out and bring it along.",
    "Miss Lippincott did you on the night of Saturday overhear a certain\nconversation\n\nWith a good deal of elaborate explanation as to the necessity she was\nunder of visiting No.",
    "4 Beatrice Lippincott told her tale.",
    "The coroner\nguided her astutely.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Did you mention this conversation you had overheard to\nanybody\n\nYes I told Mr Rowley Cloade.",
    "Why did you tell Mr Cloade\n\nI thought he ought to know.",
    "Beatrice flushed.",
    "A tall thin man Mr Claythorne rose and asked permission to put a\nquestion.",
    "In the course of the conversation between the deceased and Mr David\nHunter did the deceased at any time mention definitely that he himself\nwas Robert Underhay\n\nNo  no  he didnt.",
    "In fact he spoke of Robert Underhay as though Robert Underhay was\nquite another person\n\n\fYes  yes he did.",
    "Thank you Mr Coroner that was all I wanted to get clear.",
    "Beatrice Lippincott stood down and Rowley Cloade was called.",
    "He confirmed that Beatrice had repeated the story to him and then\ngave his account of his interview with the deceased.",
    "His last words to you were I dont think youll prove that without my\ncooperation That  being the fact that Robert Underhay was still\nalive.",
    "Thats what he said yes.",
    "And he laughed.",
    "He laughed did he What did you take those words to mean\n\nWell  I just thought he was trying to get me to make him an offer but\nafterwards I got thinking \n\nYes Mr Cloade  but what you thought afterwards is hardly relevant.",
    "Shall we put it that as a result of that interview you set about trying to\nfind some person who was acquainted with the late Robert Underhay\nAnd that with certain help you were successful.",
    "Rowley nodded.",
    "Thats right.",
    "What time was it when you left the deceased\n\nAs nearly as I can tell it was five minutes to nine.",
    "What made you fix on that time\n\nAs I went along the street I heard the nine oclock chimes through an\nopen window.",
    "Did the deceased mention at what time he was expecting this client\n\nHe said At any minute.",
    "He did not mention any name\n\nNo.",
    "David Hunter\n\nThere was just a faint soft buzz as the inhabitants of Warmsley Vale\ncraned their necks to look at the tall thin bitterlooking young man who\nstood defiantly facing the coroner.",
    "The preliminaries went rapidly.",
    "The coroner continued\n\nYou went to see the deceased on Saturday evening\n\nYes.",
    "I received a letter from him asking for assistance and stating he\nhad known my sisters first husband in Africa.",
    "You have got that letter\n\nNo I dont keep letters.",
    "You have heard the account given by Beatrice Lippincott of your\nconversation with the deceased.",
    "Is that a true account\n\nQuite untrue.",
    "The deceased spoke of knowing my late brotherinlaw\ncomplained of his own bad luck and of having come down in the world\nand begged for some financial assistance which as is usual he was\nquite confident of being able to repay.",
    "Did he tell you that Robert Underhay was still alive\n\nDavid smiled\n\nCertainly not.",
    "He said If Robert were still alive I know he would help\nme.",
    "That is quite different from what Beatrice Lippincott tells us.",
    "Eavesdroppers said David usually hear only a portion of what goes\non and frequently get the whole thing wrong owing to supplying the\nmissing details from their own fertile imaginations.",
    "Beatrice flounced angrily and exclaimed Well I never \n\nThe coroner said repressively Silence please.",
    "Now Mr Hunter did you visit the deceased again on the night of\nTuesday \n\nNo I did not.",
    "You have heard Mr Rowley Cloade say that the deceased expected a\nvisitor\n\nHe may have expected a visitor.",
    "If so I was not that visitor.",
    "Id given\nhim a fiver before.",
    "I thought that was quite enough for him.",
    "There was\nno proof that hed ever known Robert Underhay.",
    "My sister since she\ninherited a large income from her husband has been the target of\nevery begging letterwriter and every sponger in the neighbourhood.",
    "Quietly he let his eyes pass over the assembled Cloades.",
    "Mr Hunter will you tell us where you were on the evening of\nTuesday\n\nFind outsaid David.",
    "Mr Hunter The coroner rapped the table.",
    "That is a most foolish and\nilladvised thing to say.",
    "Why should I tell you where I was and what I was doing Time enough\nfor that when you accuse me of murdering the man.",
    "If you persist in that attitude it may come to that sooner than you\nthink.",
    "Do you recognise this Mr Hunter\n\n\fLeaning forward David took the gold cigarette lighter into his hand.",
    "His face was puzzled.",
    "Handing it back he said slowly Yes its mine.",
    "When did you have it last\n\nI missed it  He paused.",
    "Yes Mr Hunter The coroners voice was suave.",
    "Gaythorne fidgeted seemed about to speak.",
    "But David was too quick\nfor him.",
    "I had it last Friday  Friday morning.",
    "I dont remember seeing it since.",
    "Mr Gaythorne rose.",
    "With your permission Mr Coroner.",
    "You visited the deceased Saturday\nevening.",
    "Might you not have left the lighter there then\n\nI might have I suppose David said slowly.",
    "I certainly dont\nremember seeing it after Friday  He added Where was it found\n\nThe coroner said\n\nWe shall go into that later.",
    "You can stand down now Mr Hunter.",
    "David moved slowly back to his seat.",
    "He bent his head and whispered to Rosaleen Cloade.",
    "Major Porter.",
    "Hemming and hawing a little Major Porter took the stand.",
    "He stood\nthere an erect soldierly figure as though on parade.",
    "Only the way he moistened his lips showed the intense nervousness\nfrom which he was suffering.",
    "You are George Douglas Porter late Major of the Royal African\nRifles\n\nYes.",
    "How well did you know Robert Underhay\n\nIn a paradeground voice Major Porter barked out places and dates.",
    "You have viewed the body of the deceased\n\nYes.",
    "Can you identify that body\n\nYes.",
    "It is the body of Robert Underhay.",
    "A buzz of excitement went round the court.",
    "You state that positively and without the least doubt\n\nI do.",
    "There is no possibility of your being mistaken\n\nNone.",
    "Thank you Major Porter.",
    "Mrs Gordon Cloade.",
    "Rosaleen rose.",
    "She passed Major Porter.",
    "He looked at her with some curiosity.",
    "She did not even glance at him.",
    "Mrs Cloade you were taken by the police to see the body of the\ndeceased\n\nShe shivered.",
    "Yes.",
    "You stated definitely that it was the body of a man completely\nunknown to you\n\nYes.",
    "In view of the statement just made by Major Porter would you like to\nwithdraw or amend your own statement\n\nNo.",
    "You still assert definitely that the body was not that of your husband\nRobert Underhay\n\nIt was not my husbands body.",
    "It was a man I had never seen in my\nlife.",
    "Come now Mrs Cloade Major Porter has definitely recognised it as\nthe body of his friend Robert Underhay.",
    "Rosaleen said expressionlessly\n\nMajor Porter is mistaken.",
    "You are not under oath in this court Mrs Cloade.",
    "But it is likely that\nyou will be under oath in another court shortly.",
    "Are you prepared then\nto swear that the body is not that of Robert Underhay but of an\nunknown stranger\n\nI am prepared to swear that it is not the body of my husband but of a\nman quite unknown to me.",
    "Her voice was clear and unfaltering.",
    "Her eyes met the coroner\nunshrinkingly.",
    "He murmured You can stand down.",
    "Then removing his pincenez he addressed the jury.",
    "They were there to discover how this man came to his death.",
    "As to\nthat there could be little question.",
    "There could be no idea of accident\nor suicide.",
    "Nor could there be any suggestion of manslaughter.",
    "There remained only one verdict  wilful murder.",
    "As to the identity of\nthe dead man that was not clearly established.",
    "They had heard one witness a man of upright character and probity\nwhose word could be relied upon say that the body was that of a\nformer friend of his Robert Underhay.",
    "On the other hand Robert\nUnderhays death from fever in Africa had been established apparently\nto the satisfaction of the local authorities and no question had then\nbeen raised.",
    "In contradiction of Major Porters statement Robert Underhays\nwidow now Mrs Gordon Cloade stated positively that the body was\nnot that of Robert Underhay.",
    "These were diametrically opposite statements.",
    "Passing from the\nquestion of identity they would have to decide if there was any\nevidence to show whose hand had murdered the deceased.",
    "They\nmight think that the evidence pointed to a certain person but a good\ndeal of evidence was needed before a case could be made out evidence and motive and opportunity.",
    "The person must have been seen by someone in the vicinity of the\ncrime at the appropriate time.",
    "If there was not such evidence the best\nverdict was that of Wilful Murder without sufficient evidence to show\nby whose hand.",
    "Such a verdict would leave the police free to pursue\nthe necessary inquiries.",
    "He then dismissed them to consider their Verdict.",
    "They took three quarters of an hour.",
    "They returned a Verdict of Wilful Murder against David Hunter.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nI was afraid theyd do it said the coroner apologetically.",
    "Local\nprejudice Feeling rather than logic.",
    "The coroner the Chief Constable Superintendent Spence and Hercule\nPoirot were all in consultation together after the inquest.",
    "You did your best said the Chief Constable.",
    "Its premature to say the least of it said Spence frowning.",
    "And it\nhampers us.",
    "Do you know M. Hercule Poirot\n\nHe was instrumental in bringing Porter forward.",
    "The coroner said graciously\n\nI have heard of you M. Poirot and Poirot made an unsuccessful\nattempt to look modest.",
    "M. Poirots interested in the case said Spence with a grin.",
    "Truly that is so said Poirot.",
    "I was in it as you might say before\nthere was a case.",
    "And in answer to their interested glances he told of the queer little\nscene in the club when he had first heard a mention of Robert\nUnderhays name.",
    "Thats an additional point in Porters evidence when the case comes\nto trial said the Chief Constable thoughtfully.",
    "Underhay actually\nplanned a pretended death  and spoke of using the name of Enoch\nArden.",
    "The Chief Constable murmured Ah but will that be admissible as\nevidence Words spoken by a man who is now dead\n\nIt may not be admissible as evidence said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "But it\nraises a very interesting and suggestive line of thought.",
    "What we want said Spence is not suggestion but a few concrete\nfacts.",
    "Someone who actually saw David Hunter at the Stag or near it\non Tuesday evening.",
    "It ought to be easy said the Chief Constable frowning.",
    "If it was abroad in my country it would be easy enough said Poirot.",
    "There would be a little caf\u00e9 where someone takes the evening coffee but in provincial England He threw up his hands.",
    "The Superintendent nodded.",
    "Some of the folks are in the pubs and will stay in the pubs till closing\ntime and the rest of the population are inside their houses listening to\nthe nine oclock news.",
    "If you ever go along the main street here\nbetween eightthirty and ten its completely deserted.",
    "Not a soul.",
    "He counted on that suggested the Chief Constable.",
    "Maybe said Spence.",
    "His expression was not a happy one.",
    "Presently the Chief Constable and the coroner departed.",
    "Spence and\nPoirot were left together.",
    "You do not like the case no asked Poirot sympathetically.",
    "That young man worries me said Spence.",
    "Hes the kind that you\nnever know where you are with them.",
    "When theyre most innocent of a\nbusiness they act as though they were guilty.",
    "And when theyre guilty why youd take your oath they were angels of light\n\nYou think he is guilty asked Poirot.",
    "Dont you Spence countered.",
    "Poirot spread out his hands.",
    "I should be interested to know he said just exactly how much you\nhave against him\n\nYou dont mean legally You mean in the way of probability\n\n\fPoirot nodded.",
    "Theres the lighter said Spence.",
    "Where did you find it\n\nUnder the body.",
    "Fingerprints on it\n\nNone.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "Yes said Spence.",
    "I dont like that too much myself.",
    "Then the dead\nmans watch had stopped at 9.10.",
    "That fits in with the medical\nevidence quite nicely  and with Rowley Cloades evidence that\nUnderhay was expecting his client at any minute  presumably that\nclient was almost due.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Yes  it is all very neat.",
    "And the thing you cant get away from to my mind M. Poirot is that\nhes the only person he and his sister that is to say who has the\nghost or shadow of a motive.",
    "Either David Hunter killed Underhay  or\nelse Underhay was killed by some outsider who followed him here for\nsome reason that we know nothing about  and that seems wildly\nimprobable.",
    "Oh I agree I agree.",
    "You see theres no one in Warmsley Vale who could possibly have a\nmotive  unless by a coincidence someone is living here other than the\nHunters who had a connection with Underhay in the past.",
    "I never rule\nout coincidence but there hasnt been a hint or suggestion of anything\nof the kind.",
    "The man was a stranger to every one but that brother and\nsister.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "To the Cloade family Robert Underhay would be the apple of their eye\nto be kept alive by every possible precaution.",
    "Robert Underhay alive\nand kicking means the certainty of a large fortune divided amongst\nthem.",
    "Again mon ami I agree with you enthusiastically.",
    "Robert Underhay\nalive and kicking is what the Cloade family needs.",
    "So back we come  Rosaleen and David Hunter are the only two\npeople who have a motive.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade was in London.",
    "But David\nwe know was in Warmsley Vale that day.",
    "He arrived at 5.30 at\nWarmsley Heath station.",
    "So now we have Motive written very big and the fact that at 5.30 and\nonward to some unspecified time he was on the spot.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Now take Beatrice Lippincotts story.",
    "I believe that story.",
    "She\noverheard what she says she overheard though she may have\ngingered it up a little as is only human.",
    "Only human as you say.",
    "Apart from knowing the girl I believe her because she couldnt have\ninvented some of the things.",
    "Shed never heard of Robert Underhay\nbefore for instance.",
    "So I believe her story of what passed between the\ntwo men and not David Hunters.",
    "I too said Poirot.",
    "She strikes me as a singularly truthful witness.",
    "Weve confirmation that her story is true.",
    "What do you suppose the\nbrother and sister went off to London for\n\nThat is one of the things that has interested me most.",
    "Well the money positions like this.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade has only a life\ninterest in Gordon Cloades estate.",
    "She cant touch the capital except I believe for about a thousand pounds.",
    "But jewellery etc.",
    "is\nhers.",
    "The first thing she did on going to town was to take some of the\nmost valuable pieces round to Bond Street and sell them.",
    "She wanted\na large sum of cash quickly  in other words she had to pay a\nblackmailer.",
    "You call that evidence against David Hunter\n\nDont you\n\n\fPoirot shook his head.",
    "Evidence that there was blackmail yes.",
    "Evidence of intent to commit\nmurder no.",
    "You cannot have it both ways mon cher.",
    "Either that young\nman was going to pay up or else he was planning to kill.",
    "You have\nproduced evidence that he was planning to pay.",
    "Yes  yes perhaps that is so.",
    "But he may have changed his mind.",
    "Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I know this type said the Superintendent thoughtfully.",
    "Its a type\nthats done well during the war.",
    "Any amount of physical courage.",
    "Audacity and a reckless disregard of personal safety.",
    "The sort that will\nface any odds.",
    "Its the kind that is likely to win the V.C.",
    "though mind\nyou its often a posthumous one.",
    "Yes in wartime a man like that is a\nhero.",
    "But in peace  well in peace such men usually end up in prison.",
    "They like excitement and they cant run straight and they dont give a\ndamn for society  and finally theyve no regard for human life.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "I tell you the Superintendent repeated I know the type.",
    "There was some few minutes of silence.",
    "Eh bien said Poirot at last.",
    "We agree that we have here the type of\na killer.",
    "But that is all.",
    "It takes us no further.",
    "Spence looked at him with curiosity.",
    "Youre taking a great interest in this business M. Poirot\n\nYes.",
    "Why if I may ask\n\nFrankly Poirot spread out his hands I do not quite know.",
    "Perhaps it\nis because when two years ago I am sitting very sick in my stomach\nfor I did not like Air Raids and I am not very brave though I endeavour\nto put up the good appearance when as I say I am sitting with a sick\nfeeling here Poirot clasped his stomach expressively in the\nsmokingroom of my friends club there droning away is the club\nbore the good Major Porter recounting a long history to which nobody\nlistens but me I listen because I am wishful to distract myself from\nthe bombs and because the facts he is relating seem to me interesting\nand suggestive.",
    "And I think to myself that it is possible that some day\nsomething may come of the situation he recounts.",
    "And now something\nhas come of it.",
    "The unexpected has happened eh\n\nOn the contrary Poirot corrected him.",
    "It is the expected that has\nhappened  which in itself is sufficiently remarkable.",
    "You expected murder Spence asked sceptically.",
    "No no no But a wife remarries.",
    "Possibility that first husband is still\nalive He is alive.",
    "He may turn up He does turn up There may be\n\n\fblackmail.",
    "There\n\nis\n\nblackmail\n\nPossibility\n\ntherefore\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nblackmailer may be silenced Ma foi  he is silenced\n\nWell said Spence eyeing Poirot rather doubtfully.",
    "I suppose these\nthings run pretty close to type.",
    "Its a common sort of crime  blackmail\nresulting in murder.",
    "Not interesting you would say Usually no.",
    "But this case is\ninteresting because you see said Poirot placidly it is all wrong.",
    "All wrong What do you mean by all wrong\n\nNone of it is how shall I put it the right shape\n\nSpence stared.",
    "Chief Inspector Japp he remarked always said you\nhave a tortuous mind.",
    "Give me an instance of what you call wrong\n\nWell the dead man for instance he is all wrong.",
    "Spence shook his head.",
    "You do not feel that Poirot asked.",
    "Oh well perhaps I am fanciful.",
    "Then take this point.",
    "Underhay arrives at the Stag.",
    "He writes to David\nHunter.",
    "Hunter receives that letter the next morning  at breakfast\ntime\n\nYes thats so.",
    "He admits receiving a letter from Arden then.",
    "That was the first intimation was it not of the arrival of Underhay in\nWarmsley Vale What is the first thing he does  bundles his sister off\nto London\n\nThats quite understandable said Spence.",
    "He wants a clear hand to\ndeal with things his own way.",
    "He may have been afraid the woman\nwould have been weak.",
    "Hes the leading spirit remember.",
    "Mrs Cloade\nis entirely under his thumb.",
    "Oh yes that shows itself plainly.",
    "So he sends her to London and calls\non this Enoch Arden.",
    "We have a pretty clear account of their\nconversation from Beatrice Lippincott and the thing that sticks out a\nmile as you say is that David Hunter was not sure whether the man he\nwas talking to was Robert Underhay or not.",
    "He suspected it but he\ndidnt know.",
    "But theres nothing odd about that M. Poirot.",
    "Rosaleen Hunter\nmarried Underhay in Cape Town and went with him straight to Nigeria.",
    "Hunter and Underhay never met.",
    "Therefore though as you say.",
    "Hunter\nsuspected that Arden was Underhay he couldnt know it for a fact because he had never met the man.",
    "Poirot looked at Superintendent Spence thoughtfully.",
    "So there is nothing there that strikes you as  peculiar he asked.",
    "I know what youre driving at.",
    "Why didnt Underhay say straight out\nthat he was Underhay Well I think thats understandable too.",
    "Respectable people who are doing something crooked like to preserve\nappearances.",
    "They like to put things in such a way that it keeps them\n\n\fin the clear  if you know what I mean.",
    "No  I dont think that that is so\nvery remarkable.",
    "Youve got to allow for human nature.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "Human nature.",
    "That I think is perhaps the real\nanswer as to why I am interested in this case.",
    "I was looking round the\nCoroners Court looking at all the people looking particularly at the\nCloades  so many of them all bound by a common interest all so\ndifferent in their characters in their thoughts and feelings.",
    "All of them\ndependent for many years on the strong man the power in the family\non Gordon Cloade I do not mean perhaps directly dependent.",
    "They\nall had their independent means of existence.",
    "But they had come they\nmust have come consciously or unconsciously to lean on him.",
    "And\nwhat happens  I will ask you this Superintendent  What happens to\nthe ivy when the oak round which it clings is struck down\n\nThats hardly a question in my line said Spence.",
    "You think not I think it is.",
    "Character mon cher does not stand still.",
    "It\ncan gather strength.",
    "It can also deteriorate.",
    "What a person really is is\nonly apparent when the test comes  that is the moment when you\nstand or fall on your own feet.",
    "I dont really know what you are getting at M. Poirot.",
    "Spence looked\nbewildered.",
    "Anyway the Cloades are all right now.",
    "Or will be once\nthe legal formalities are through.",
    "That Poirot reminded him might take some time.",
    "There is still Mrs\nGordon Cloades evidence to shake.",
    "After all a woman should know\nher own husband when she sees him\n\n\fHe put his head a little on one side and gazed inquiringly at the big\nSuperintendent.",
    "Isnt it worth while to a woman not to recognise her husband if the\nincome of a couple of million pounds depends on it asked the\nSuperintendent cynically.",
    "Besides if he wasnt Robert Underhay why\nwas he killed\n\nThat murmured Poirot is indeed the question.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nPoirot left the police station frowning to himself.",
    "His steps grew slower\nas he walked.",
    "In the market square he paused looking about him.",
    "There was Dr Cloades house with its worn brass plate and a little way\nalong was the post office.",
    "On the other side was Jeremy Cloades\nhouse.",
    "In front of Poirot set back a little was the Roman Catholic Church of\nthe Assumption a small modest affair a shrinking violet compared to\nthe aggressiveness of St. Marys which stood arrogantly in the middle\nof the square facing the Cornmarket and proclaiming the dominance\nof the Protestant religion.",
    "Moved by an impulse Poirot went through the gate and along the path\nto the door of the Roman Catholic building.",
    "He removed his hat genuflected in front of the altar and knelt down\nbehind one of the chairs.",
    "His prayers were interrupted by the sound of\nstifled heartbroken sobs.",
    "He turned his head.",
    "Across the aisle a woman in a dark dress was\nkneeling her head buried in her hands.",
    "Presently she got up and still\nsobbing under her breath went towards the door.",
    "Poirot his eyes\nwide with interest got up and followed her.",
    "He had recognised\nRosaleen Cloade.",
    "She stood in the porch fighting for control and there Poirot spoke to\nher very gently\n\nMadame can I help you\n\nShe showed no signs of surprise but answered with the simplicity of\nan unhappy child.",
    "No she said.",
    "No one can help me.",
    "You are in very bad trouble.",
    "That is it is it not\n\nShe said Theyve taken David away... Im all alone.",
    "They say he killed\n But he didnt He didnt\n\nShe looked at Poirot and said You were there today At the inquest.",
    "I\nsaw you\n\nYes.",
    "If I can help you Madame I shall be very glad to do so.",
    "Im frightened.",
    "David said Id be safe as long as he was there to look\nafter me.",
    "But now theyve taken him away  Im afraid.",
    "He said  they all\nwanted me dead.",
    "Thats a dreadful thing to say.",
    "But perhaps its true.",
    "Let me help you Madame.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "No she said.",
    "No one can help me.",
    "I cant go to confession even.",
    "Ive got to bear the weight of my wickedness all alone.",
    "Im cut off from\nthe mercy of God.",
    "Nobody said Hercule Poirot is cut off from the mercy of God.",
    "You\nknow that well my child.",
    "Again she looked at him  a wild unhappy look.",
    "Id have to confess my sins  to confess.",
    "If I could confess \n\nCant you confess You came to the church for that did you not\n\nI came to get comfort  comfort.",
    "But what comfort is there for me Im\na sinner.",
    "We are all sinners.",
    "But youd have to repent  Id have to say  to tell  Her hands went up\nto her face.",
    "Oh the lies Ive told  the lies Ive told.",
    "You told a lie about your husband About Robert Underhay It was\nRobert Underhay who was killed here wasnt it\n\n\fShe turned sharply on him.",
    "Her eyes were suspicious wary.",
    "She cried\nout sharply\n\nI tell you it was not my husband.",
    "It wasnt the least like him\n\nThe dead man was not in the least like your husband\n\nNo she said defiantly.",
    "Tell me said Poirot what was your husband like\n\nHer eyes stared at him.",
    "Then her face hardened into alarm.",
    "Her eyes\ngrew dark with fear.",
    "She cried out\n\nIll not talk to you any more\n\nGoing swiftly past him she ran down the path and passed through the\ngate out into the market square.",
    "Poirot did not try and follow her.",
    "Instead he nodded his head with a\ngood deal of satisfaction.",
    "Ah he said.",
    "So that is that\n\nHe walked slowly out into the square.",
    "After a momentary hesitation he followed the High Street until he came\nto the Stag which was the last building before the open country.",
    "In the doorway of the Stag he met Rowley Cloade and Lynn\nMarchmont.",
    "Poirot looked at the girl with interest.",
    "A handsome girl he thought and\nintelligent also.",
    "Not the type he himself admired.",
    "He preferred\nsomething softer more feminine.",
    "Lynn Marchmont he thought was\nessentially a modern type  though one might with equal accuracy\ncall it an Elizabethan type.",
    "Women who thought for themselves who\nwere free in language and who admired enterprise and audacity in\nmen.",
    "Were very grateful to you M. Poirot said Rowley.",
    "By Jove it really\nwas quite like a conjuring trick.",
    "Which was exactly what it had been Poirot reflected Asked a question\nto which you knew the answer there was no difficulty whatsoever in\nperforming a trick with the requisite frills.",
    "He quite appreciated that to\nthe simple Rowley the production of Major Porter out of the blue so to\nspeak had been as breathtaking as any amount of rabbits produced\nfrom the conjurers hat.",
    "How you go about these things beats me said Rowley.",
    "Poirot did not enlighten him.",
    "He was after all only human.",
    "The\nconjurer does not tell his audience how the trick was done.",
    "Anyway Lynn and I are no end grateful Rowley went on.",
    "Lynn Marchmont Poirot thought was not looking particularly grateful.",
    "There were lines of strain round her eyes her fingers had a nervous\ntrick of twining and intertwining themselves.",
    "Its going to make a lot of difference to our future married life said\nRowley.",
    "Lynn said sharply\n\nHow do you know There are all sorts of formalities and things Im\nsure.",
    "You are getting married when asked Poirot politely.",
    "June.",
    "And you have been engaged since when\n\nNearly six years said Rowley.",
    "Lynns just come out of the Wrens.",
    "And is it forbidden to marry in the Wrens yes\n\nLynn said briefly\n\nIve been overseas.",
    "Poirot noticed Rowleys swift frown.",
    "He said shortly\n\nCome on Lynn.",
    "We must get going.",
    "I expect M. Poirot wants to get\nback to town.",
    "Poirot said smilingly\n\nBut Im not going back to town.",
    "What\n\nRowley stopped dead giving a queer wooden effect.",
    "I am staying here at the Stag for a short while.",
    "But  but why\n\nCest un beau paysage Poirot said placidly.",
    "Rowley said uncertainly\n\nYes of course...",
    "But arent you  well I mean busy\n\nI have made my economies said Poirot smiling.",
    "I do not need to\noccupy myself unduly.",
    "No I can enjoy my leisure and spend my time\nwhere the fancy takes me.",
    "And my fancy inclines to Warmsley Vale.",
    "He saw Lynn Marchmont raise her head and gaze at him intently.",
    "Rowley he thought was slightly annoyed.",
    "I suppose you play golf he said.",
    "Theres a much better hotel at\nWarmsley Heath.",
    "This is a very onehorse sort of place.",
    "My interests said Poirot lie entirely in Warmsley Vale.",
    "Lynn said\n\nCome along Rowley.",
    "Half reluctantly Rowley followed her.",
    "At the door Lynn paused and then came swiftly back.",
    "She spoke to\nPoirot in a quiet low voice.",
    "They arrested David Hunter after the inquest.",
    "Do you  do you think\nthey were right\n\nThey had no alternative.",
    "Mademoiselle after the verdict.",
    "I mean  do you think he did it\n\nDo you said Poirot.",
    "But Rowley was back at her side.",
    "Her face hardened to a poker\nsmoothness.",
    "She said\n\nGoodbye M. Poirot.",
    "I  I hope we meet again.",
    "Now I wonder said Poirot to himself.",
    "Presently after arranging with Beatrice Lippincott about a room he\nwent out again.",
    "His steps led him to Dr Lionel Cloades house.",
    "Oh said Aunt Kathie who opened the door taking a step or two\nbackwards.",
    "M. Poirot\n\nAt your service Madame.",
    "Poirot bowed.",
    "I came to pay my\nrespects.",
    "Well thats very nice of you Im sure.",
    "Yes  well  I suppose youd\nbetter come in.",
    "Sit down  Ill move Madame Blavatsky  and perhaps a\ncup of tea  only the cake is terribly stale.",
    "I meant to go to Peacocks for\nsome they do have Swiss roll sometimes on a Wednesday  but an\ninquest puts ones household routine out dont you think so\n\nPoirot said that he thought that was entirely understandable.",
    "He had fancied that Rowley Cloade was annoyed by the announcement\nof his stay in Warmsley Vale.",
    "Aunt Kathies manner without any doubt\nwas far from welcoming.",
    "She was looking at him with something not far\nfrom dismay.",
    "She said leaning forward and speaking in a hoarse\nconspiratorial whisper\n\nYou wont tell my husband will you that I came and consulted you\nabout  well about we know what\n\nMy lips are sealed.",
    "I mean  of course Id no idea at the time  that Robert Underhay poor\nman so tragic  was actually in Warmsley Vale.",
    "That seems to me still a\nmost extraordinary coincidence\n\n\fIt would have been simpler agreed Poirot if the Ouija board had\ndirected you straight to the Stag.",
    "Aunt Kathie cheered up a little at the mention of the Ouija board.",
    "The way things come about in the spirit world seem quite\nincalculable she said.",
    "But I do feel M. Poirot that there is a purpose\nin it all Dont you feel that in life That there is always a purpose\n\nYes indeed Madame.",
    "Even that I should sit here now in your\ndrawingroom there is a purpose in that.",
    "Oh is there Mrs Cloade looked rather taken aback.",
    "Is there\nreally Yes I suppose so... Youre on your way back to London of\ncourse\n\nNot at present.",
    "I stay for a few days at the Stag.",
    "At the Stag.",
    "Oh  at the Stag But thats where  oh M. Poirot do you\nthink you are wise\n\nI have been guided to the Stag said Poirot solemnly.",
    "Guided What do you mean\n\nGuided by you.",
    "Oh but I never meant  I mean I had no idea.",
    "Its all so dreadful dont\nyou think so\n\n\fPoirot shook his head sadly and said\n\nI have been talking to Mr Rowley Cloade and Miss Marchmont.",
    "They\nare getting married I hear quite soon\n\nAunt Kathie was immediately diverted.",
    "Dear Lynn she is such a sweet girl  and so very good at figures.",
    "Now\nI have no head for figures  no head at all.",
    "Having Lynn home is an\nabsolute blessing.",
    "If I get in a terrible muddle she always straightens\nthings out for me.",
    "Dear girl I do hope she will be happy.",
    "Rowley of\ncourse is a splendid person but possibly  well a little dull.",
    "I mean dull\nto a girl who has seen as much of the world as Lynn has.",
    "Rowley you\nsee has been here on his farm all through the war  oh quite rightly of\ncourse  I mean the Government wanted him to  that side of it is quite\nall right  not white feathers or things like that as they did in the Boer\nWar  but what I mean is its made him rather limited in his ideas.",
    "Six years engagement is a good test of affection.",
    "Oh it is But I think these girls when they come home they get rather\nrestless  and if there is someone else about  someone perhaps who\nhas led an adventurous life \n\nSuch as David Hunter\n\nThere isnt anything between them Aunt Kathie said anxiously.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "Im quite sure of that It would have been dreadful if\nthere had been wouldnt there with his turning out a murderer His\nown brotherinlaw too Oh no M. Poirot please dont run away with\n\n\fthe idea that theres any kind of an understanding between Lynn and\nDavid.",
    "Really they seemed to quarrel more than anything else every\ntime they met.",
    "What I feel is that  oh dear I think thats my husband\ncoming.",
    "You will remember wont you M. Poirot not a word about our\nfirst meeting My poor dear husband gets so annoyed if he thinks that oh Lionel dear here is M. Poirot who so cleverly brought that Major\nPorter down to see the body.",
    "Dr Cloade looked tired and haggard.",
    "His eyes pale blue with pinpoint\npupils wandered vaguely round the room.",
    "How do you do M. Poirot on your way back to town\n\nMon Dieu another who packs me back to London thought Poirot.",
    "Aloud he said patiently\n\nNo I remain at the Stag for a day or so.",
    "The Stag Lionel Cloade frowned.",
    "Oh Police want to keep you here\nfor a bit\n\nNo.",
    "It is my own choice.",
    "Indeed The doctor suddenly flashed a quick intelligent look.",
    "So\nyoure not satisfied\n\nWhy should you think that Dr Cloade\n\nCome man its true isnt it\n\n\fTwittering about tea Mrs Cloade left the room.",
    "The doctor went on\nYouve a feeling havent you that somethings wrong\n\nPoirot was startled.",
    "It is odd that you should say that.",
    "Do you then feel that yourself\n\nCloade hesitated.",
    "Nno.",
    "Hardly that... perhaps its just a feeling of unreality.",
    "In books\nthe blackmailer gets slugged.",
    "Does he in real life Apparently the\nanswer is yes.",
    "But it seems unnatural.",
    "Was there anything unsatisfactory about the medical aspect of the\ncase I ask unofficially of course.",
    "Dr Cloade said thoughtfully\n\nNo I dont think so.",
    "Yes  there is something.",
    "I can see there is something.",
    "When he wished Poirots voice could assume an almost hypnotic\nquality.",
    "Dr Cloade frowned a little then he said hesitatingly\n\nIve no experience of course of police cases.",
    "And anyway medical\nevidence isnt the hardandfast castiron business that laymen or\nnovelists seem to think.",
    "Were fallible  medical science is fallible.",
    "Whats diagnosis A guess based on a very little knowledge and some\n\n\findefinite clues which point in more than one direction.",
    "Im pretty\nsound perhaps at diagnosing measles because at my time of life Ive\nseen hundreds of cases of measles and I know an extraordinary wide\nvariation of signs and symptoms.",
    "You hardly ever get what a text book\ntells you is a typical case of measles.",
    "But Ive known some queer\nthings in my time  Ive seen a woman practically on the operating table\nready for her appendix to be whipped out  and paratyphoid diagnosed\njust in time Ive seen a child with skin trouble pronounced as a case of\nserious vitamin deficiency by an earnest and conscientious young\ndoctor  and the local vet comes along and mentions to the mother that\nthe cat the child is hugging has got ringworm and that the child has\ncaught it\n\nDoctors like every one else are victims of the preconceived idea.",
    "Heres a man obviously murdered lying with a bloodstained pair of\nfiretongs beside him.",
    "It would be nonsense to say he was hit with\nanything else and yet speaking out of complete inexperience of\npeople with their heads smashed in Id have suspected something\nrather different  something not so smooth and round  something  oh\nI dont know something with a more cutting edge  a brick something\nlike that.",
    "You did not say so at the inquest\n\nNo  because I dont really know.",
    "Jenkins the police surgeon was\nsatisfied and hes the fellow who counts.",
    "But theres the preconceived\nidea  weapon lying beside the body.",
    "Could the wound have been\ninflicted with that Yes it could.",
    "But if you were shown the wound and\nasked what made it  well I dont know whether youd say it because it\n\n\freally doesnt make sense  I mean if you had two fellows one hitting\nhim with a brick and one with the tongs \n\nThe doctor stopped shook his head in a dissatisfied way.",
    "Doesnt make sense does it he said to Poirot.",
    "Could he have fallen on some sharp object\n\nDr Cloade shook his head.",
    "He was lying face down in the middle of the floor  on a good thick oldfashioned Axminster carpet.",
    "He broke off as his wife entered the room.",
    "Heres Kathie with the catlap.",
    "he remarked.",
    "Aunt Kathie was balancing a tray covered with crockery half a loaf of\nbread and some depressinglooking jam in the bottom of a 2lb.",
    "pot.",
    "I think the kettle was boiling she remarked doubtfully as she raised\nthe lid of the teapot and peered inside.",
    "Dr Cloade snorted again and muttered Catlap with which explosive\nword he left the room.",
    "Poor Lionel his nerves are in a terrible state since the war.",
    "He\nworked much too hard.",
    "So many doctors away.",
    "He gave himself no\nrest.",
    "Out morning noon and night.",
    "I wonder he didnt break down\n\n\fcompletely.",
    "Of course he looked forward to retiring as soon as peace\ncame.",
    "That was all fixed up with Gordon.",
    "His hobby you know is\nbotany with special reference to medicinal herbs in the Middle Ages.",
    "Hes writing a book on it.",
    "He was looking forward to a quiet life and\ndoing the necessary research.",
    "But then when Gordon died like that well you know what things are M. Poirot nowadays.",
    "Taxation and\neverything.",
    "He cant afford to retire and its made him very bitter.",
    "And\nreally it does seem unfair.",
    "Gordons dying like that without a will  well\nit really quite shook my faith.",
    "I mean I really couldnt see the purpose\nin that.",
    "It seemed I couldnt help feeling a mistake.",
    "She sighed then cheered up a little.",
    "But I get some lovely reassurances from the other side.",
    "Courage and\npatience and a way will be found.",
    "And really when that nice Major\nPorter stood up today and said in such a firm manly way that the poor\nmurdered man was Robert Underhay  well I saw that a way had been\nfound Its wonderful isnt it M. Poirot how things do turn out for the\nbest\n\nEven murder said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nPoirot entered the Stag in a thoughtful mood and shivering slightly for\nthere was a sharp east wind.",
    "The hall was deserted.",
    "He pushed open\nthe door of the lounge on the right.",
    "It smelt of stale smoke and the fire\nwas nearly out.",
    "Poirot tiptoed along to the door at the end of the hall\nlabelled Residents Only.",
    "Here there was a good fire but in a large\narmchair comfortably toasting her toes was a monumental old lady\n\n\fwho glared at Poirot with such ferocity that he beat an apologetic\nretreat.",
    "He stood for a moment in the hall looking from the glassenclosed\nempty office to the door labelled in firm oldfashioned style CoffeeRoom.",
    "By experience of country hotels Poirot knew well that the only\ntime coffee was served there was somewhat grudgingly for breakfast\nand that even then a good deal of watery hot milk was its principal\ncomponent.",
    "Small cups of a treacly and muddy liquid called Black\nCoffee were served not in the CoffeeRoom but in the lounge.",
    "The\nWindsor Soup Vienna Steak and Potatoes and Steamed Pudding\nwhich comprised Dinner would be obtainable in the CoffeeRoom at\nseven sharp.",
    "Until then a deep peace brooded over the residential\narea of the Stag.",
    "Poirot went thoughtfully up the staircase.",
    "Instead of turning to the left\nwhere his own room.",
    "No.",
    "11 was situated he turned to the right and\nstopped before the door of No.",
    "5.",
    "He looked round him.",
    "Silence and\nemptiness.",
    "He opened the door and went in.",
    "The police had done with the room.",
    "It had clearly been freshly cleaned\nand scrubbed.",
    "There was no carpet on the floor.",
    "Presumably the oldfashioned Axminster had gone to the cleaners.",
    "The blankets were\nfolded on the bed in a neat pile.",
    "Closing the door behind him Poirot wandered round the room.",
    "It was\nclean and strangely barren of human interest.",
    "Poirot took in its\nfurnishings  a writingtable a chest of drawers of good oldfashioned\nmahogany an upright wardrobe of the same the one presumably that\nmasked the door into No.",
    "4 a large brass double bed a basin with hot\n\n\fand cold water  tribute to modernity and the servant shortage  a large\nbut rather uncomfortable armchair two small chairs an oldfashioned\nVictorian grate with a poker and a pierced shovel belonging to the\nsame set as the firetongs a heavy marble mantelpiece and a solid\nmarble firecurb with squared corners.",
    "It was at these last that Poirot bent and looked.",
    "Moistening his finger\nhe rubbed it along the righthand corner and then inspected the result.",
    "His finger was slightly black.",
    "He repeated the performance with\nanother finger on the lefthand corner of the curb.",
    "This time his finger\nwas quite clean.",
    "Yes said Poirot thoughtfully to himself.",
    "Yes.",
    "He looked at the fitted washbasin.",
    "Then he strolled to the window.",
    "It\nlooked out over some leads  the roof of a garage he fancied and then\nto a small back alley.",
    "An easy way to come and go unseen from room\nNo.",
    "5.",
    "But then it was equally easy to walk upstairs to No.",
    "5 unseen.",
    "He\nhad just done it himself.",
    "Quietly Poirot withdrew shutting the door noiselessly behind him.",
    "He\nwent along to his own room.",
    "It was decidedly chilly.",
    "He went\ndownstairs again hesitated and then driven by the chill of the\nevening boldly entered the Residents Only drew up a second armchair to the fire and sat down.",
    "The monumental old lady was even more formidable seen close at\nhand.",
    "She had irongrey hair a nourishing moustache and when\npresently she spoke a deep and aweinspiring voice.",
    "This lounge she said is Reserved for persons staying in the hotel.",
    "I am staying in the Hotel replied Hercule Poirot.",
    "The old lady meditated for a moment or two before returning to the\nattack.",
    "Then she said accusingly\n\nYoure a foreigner.",
    "Yes replied Hercule Poirot.",
    "In my opinion said the old lady you should all go back.",
    "Go back where inquired Poirot.",
    "To where you came from said the old lady firmly.",
    "She added as a kind of rider sotto voce Foreigners and snorted.",
    "That said Poirot mildly would be difficult.",
    "Nonsense said the old lady.",
    "Thats what we fought the war for isnt\nit So that people could go back to their proper places and stay there.",
    "Poirot did not enter into a controversy.",
    "He had already learnt that\nevery single individual had a different version of the theme.",
    "What did\nwe fight the war for\n\n\fA somewhat hostile silence reigned.",
    "I dont know what things are coming to said the old lady.",
    "I really\ndont.",
    "Every year I come and stay in this place.",
    "My husband died here\nsixteen years ago.",
    "Hes buried here.",
    "I come every year for a month.",
    "A pious pilgrimage said Poirot politely.",
    "And every year things get worse and worse.",
    "No service Food\nuneatable Vienna steaks indeed A steaks either Rump or Fillet steak\n not choppedup horse\n\nPoirot shook his head sadly.",
    "One good thing  theyve shut down the aerodrome said the old lady.",
    "Disgraceful it was all those young airmen coming in here with those\ndreadful girls.",
    "Girls indeed I dont know what their mothers are\nthinking of nowadays.",
    "Letting them gad about as they do.",
    "I blame the\nGovernment.",
    "Sending the mothers to work in factories.",
    "Only let em off\nif theyve got young children.",
    "Young children stuff and nonsense Any\none can look after a baby A baby doesnt go running round after\nsoldiers.",

    "It takes a mother to know just what\na girl is up to.",
    "Soldiers Airmen Thats all they think about.",
    "Americans\nNiggers Polish riffraff\n\nIndignation at this point made the old lady cough.",
    "When she had\nrecovered she went on working herself into a pleasurable frenzy and\nusing Poirot as a target for her spleen.",
    "Why do they have barbed wire round their camps To keep the\nsoldiers from getting at the girls No to keep the girls from getting at\nthe soldiers Manmad thats what they are Look at the way they\ndress.",
    "Trousers Some poor fools wear shorts  they wouldnt if they\nknew what they looked like from behind\n\nI agree with you Madame indeed I agree with you.",
    "What do they wear on their heads Proper hats No a twisted up bit\nof stuff and faces covered with paint and powder.",
    "Filthy stuff all over\ntheir mouths.",
    "Not only red nails  but red toenails\n\nThe old lady paused explosively and looked at Poirot expectantly.",
    "He\nsighed and shook his head.",
    "Even in church said the old lady.",
    "No hats.",
    "Sometimes not even\nthose silly scarves.",
    "Just that ugly crimped permanently waved hair.",
    "Hair Nobody knows what hair is nowadays.",
    "I could sit on my hair\nwhen I was young.",
    "Poirot stole a glance at the irongrey bands.",
    "It seemed impossible that\nthis fierce old woman could ever have been young\n\nPut her head in here the other night one of them did the old lady\nwent on.",
    "Tied up in an orange scarf and painted and powdered.",
    "I\nlooked at her.",
    "I just looked at her She soon went away\n\nShe wasnt a Resident went on the old lady.",
    "No one of her type\nstaying here Im glad to say So what was she doing coming out of a\nmans bedroom Disgusting I call it.",
    "I spoke about it to that Lippincott\n\n\fgirl  but shes just as bad as any of them  go a mile for anything that\nwears trousers.",
    "Some faint interest stirred in Poirots mind.",
    "Coming out a mans bedroom he queried.",
    "The old lady fell upon the topic with zest.",
    "Thats what I said.",
    "Saw her with my own eyes.",
    "No.",
    "5.",
    "What day was that Madame\n\nThe day before there was all that fuss about a man being murdered.",
    "Disgraceful that such a thing could happen here This used to be a\nvery decent oldfashioned type of place.",
    "But now \n\nAnd what hour of the day was this\n\nDay It wasnt day at all.",
    "Evening.",
    "Late evening too.",
    "Perfectly\ndisgraceful.",
    "Past ten oclock.",
    "I go up to bed at a quarterpast ten.",
    "Out\nshe comes from No.",
    "5 as bold as brass stares at me then dodges\nback inside again laughing and talking with the man there.",
    "You heard him speak\n\nArent I telling you so She dodges back inside and he calls out Oh\ngo on get out of here.",
    "Im fed up.",
    "Thats a nice way for a man to talk to\na girl But they ask for it Hussies\n\n\fPoirot said You did not report this to the police\n\nShe fixed him with a basilisk stare and totteringly rose out of her chair.",
    "Standing over him and glaring down on him she said\n\nI have never had anything to do with the police.",
    "The police indeed I\nin a police court\n\nQuivering with rage and with one last malevolent glance at Poirot she\nleft the room.",
    "Poirot sat for a few minutes thoughtfully caressing his moustache\nthen he went in search of Beatrice Lippincott.",
    "Oh yes M. Poirot you mean old Mrs Leadbetter Canon Leadbetters\nwidow.",
    "She comes here every year but of course between ourselves\nshe is rather a trial.",
    "Shes really frightfully rude to people sometimes\nand she doesnt seem to understand that things are different\nnowadays.",
    "Shes nearly eighty of course.",
    "But she is clear in her mind She knows what she is saying\n\nOh yes.",
    "Shes quite a sharp old lady  rather too much so sometimes.",
    "Do you know who a young woman was who visited the murdered man\non Tuesday night\n\nBeatrice looked astonished.",
    "I dont remember a young woman coming to visit him at any time.",
    "What was she like\n\nShe was wearing an orange scarf round her head and I should fancy a\ngood deal of makeup.",
    "She was in No.",
    "5 talking to Arden at a quarter\npast ten on Tuesday night.",
    "Really M. Poirot Ive no idea whatsoever.",
    "Thoughtfully Poirot went along in search of Superintendent Spence.",
    "Spence listened to Poirots story in silence.",
    "Then he leaned back in his\nchair and nodded his head slowly.",
    "Funny isnt it he said.",
    "How often you come back to the same old\nformula.",
    "Cherchez la femme.",
    "The Superintendents French accent was not as good as Sergeant\nGraves but he was proud of it.",
    "He got up and went across the room.",
    "He came back holding something in his hand.",
    "It was a lipstick in a gilt\ncardboard case.",
    "We had this indication all along that there might be a woman mixed up\nin it he said.",
    "Poirot took the lipstick and smeared a little delicately on the back of\nhis hand.",
    "Good quality he said.",
    "A dark cherry red  worn by a brunette\nprobably.",
    "Yes.",
    "It was found on the floor of No.",
    "5.",
    "It had rolled under the chest of\ndrawers and of course just possibly it might have been there some\ntime.",
    "No fingerprints on it.",
    "Nowadays of course there isnt the range\nof lipsticks there used to be  just a few standard makes.",
    "And you have no doubt made your inquiries\n\nSpence smiled.",
    "Yes he said as you put it we have made our inquiries.",
    "Rosaleen\nCloade uses this type of lipstick.",
    "So does Lynn Marchmont.",
    "Frances\nCloade uses a more subdued colour.",
    "Mrs Lionel Cloade doesnt use\nlipstick at all.",
    "Mrs Marchmont uses a pale mauve shade.",
    "Beatrice\nLippincott doesnt appear to use anything as expensive as this  nor\ndoes the chambermaid Gladys.",
    "He paused.",
    "You have been thorough said Poirot.",
    "Not thorough enough.",
    "It looks now as though an outsider is mixed up\nin it  some woman perhaps that Underhay knew in Warmsley Vale.",
    "And who was with him at a quarter past ten on Tuesday evening\n\nYes said Spence.",
    "He added with a sigh This lets David Hunter out.",
    "It does\n\n\fYes.",
    "His lordship has consented to make a statement at last.",
    "After his\nsolicitor had been along to make him see reason.",
    "Heres his account of\nhis own movements.",
    "Poirot read a neat typed memorandum.",
    "Left London 4.16 train for Warmsley Heath.",
    "Arrived there 5.30.",
    "Walked\nto Furrowbank by footpath.",
    "His reason for coming down the Superintendent broke in was\naccording to him to get certain things hed left behind letters and\npapers a chequebook and to see if some shirts had come back from\nthe laundry  which of course they hadnt.",
    "My word laundrys a\nproblem nowadays.",
    "Four ruddy weeks since theyve been to our place\n not a clean towel left in our house and the wife washes all my things\nherself now.",
    "After this very human interpolation the Superintendent returned to the\nitinerary of Davids movements.",
    "Left Furrowbank at 7.25 and states he went for a walk as he had\nmissed the 7.20 train and there would be no train until the 9.20.",
    "In what direction did he go for a walk asked Poirot.",
    "The Superintendent consulted his notes.",
    "Says by Downe Copse Bats Hill and Long Ridge.",
    "In fact a complete circular tour round the White House\n\n\fMy word you pick up local geography quickly M. Poirot\n\nPoirot smiled and shook his head.",
    "No I did not know the places you named.",
    "I was making a guess.",
    "Oh you were were you The Superintendent cocked his head on\none side.",
    "Then according to him when he was up on Long Ridge he realised\nhe was cutting it rather fine and fairly hared it for Warmsley Heath\nstation going across country.",
    "He caught the train by the skin of his\nteeth arrived at Victoria 10.45 walked to Shepherds Court arriving\nthere at eleven oclock which latter statement is confirmed by Mrs\nGordon Cloade.",
    "And what confirmation have you of the rest of it\n\nRemarkably little  but there is some.",
    "Rowley Cloade and others saw\nhim arrive at Warmsley Heath.",
    "The maids at Furrowbank were out he\nhad his own key of course so they didnt see him but they found a\ncigarette stump in the library which I gather intrigued them and also\nfound a good deal of confusion in the linen cupboard.",
    "Then one of the\ngardeners was there working late  shutting up greenhouses or\nsomething and he caught sight of him.",
    "Miss Marchmont met him up by\nMardon Wood  when he was running for the train.",
    "Did any one see him catch the train\n\n\fNo  but he telephoned from London to Miss Marchmont as soon as he\ngot back  at 11.05.",
    "That is checked\n\nYes wed already put through an inquiry about calls from that\nnumber.",
    "There was a Toll call out at 11.04 to Warmsley Vale 36.",
    "Thats\nthe Marchmonts number.",
    "Very very interesting murmured Poirot.",
    "But Spence was going on painstakingly and methodically.",
    "Rowley Cloade left Arden at five minutes to nine.",
    "Hes quite definite it\nwasnt earlier.",
    "About 9.10 Lynn Marchmont sees Hunter up at Mardon\nWood.",
    "Granted hes run all the way from the Stag would he have had\ntime to meet Arden quarrel with him kill him and get to Mardon Wood\nWere going into it and I dont think it can be done.",
    "However now were\nstarting again.",
    "Far from Arden being killed at nine oclock he was alive\nat ten minutes past ten  that is unless your old lady is dreaming.",
    "He\nwas either killed by the woman who dropped the lipstick the woman in\nthe orange scarf  or by somebody who came in after that woman left.",
    "And whoever did it deliberately put the hands of the watch back to\nnineten.",
    "Which if David Hunter had not happened to meet Lynn Marchmont in a\nvery unlikely place would have been remarkably awkward for him\nsaid Poirot.",
    "Yes it would.",
    "The 9.20 is the last train up from Warmsley Heath.",
    "It\nwas growing dark.",
    "There are always golfers going back by it.",
    "Nobody\nwould have noticed Hunter  indeed the station people dont know him\nby sight.",
    "And he didnt take a taxi at the other end.",
    "So wed only have\nhis sisters word for it that he arrived back at Shepherds Court when\nhe said he did.",
    "Poirot was silent and Spence asked\n\nWhat are you thinking about M. Poirot\n\nPoirot said A long walk round the White House.",
    "A meeting in Mardon\nWoods.",
    "A telephone call later... And Lynn Marchmont is engaged to\nRowley Cloade...",
    "I should like very much to know what was said over\nthat telephone call.",
    "Its the human interest thats getting you\n\nYes said Poirot.",
    "It is always the human interest.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nIt was getting late but there was still one more call that Poirot wanted\nto make.",
    "He went along to Jeremy Cloades house.",
    "There he was shown into Jeremy Cloades study by a small intelligentlooking maid.",
    "Left alone Poirot gazed interestedly round him.",
    "All very legal and dry\nas dust he thought even in his home.",
    "There was a large portrait of\n\n\fGordon Cloade on the desk.",
    "Another faded one of Lord Edward\nTrenton on a horse and Poirot was examining the latter when Jeremy\nCloade came in.",
    "Ah pardon.",
    "Poirot put the photoframe down in some confusion.",
    "My wifes father said Jeremy a faint selfcongratulatory note in his\nvoice.",
    "And one of his best horses.",
    "Chestnut Trenton.",
    "Ran second in\nthe Derby in 1924.",
    "Are you interested in racing\n\nAlas no.",
    "Runs away with a lot of money said Jeremy dryly.",
    "Lord Edward\ncame a crash over it  had to go and live abroad.",
    "Yes an expensive\nsport.",
    "But there was still the note of pride in his voice.",
    "He himself Poirot judged would as soon throw his money in the street\nas invest it in horseflesh but he had a secret admiration and respect\nfor those who did.",
    "Cloade went on\n\nWhat can I do for you M. Poirot As a family I feel we owe you a debt\nof gratitude  for finding Major Porter to give evidence of\nidentification.",
    "The family seems very jubilant about it said Poirot.",
    "Ah said Jeremy dryly.",
    "Rather premature to rejoice.",
    "Lot of waters\ngot to pass under the bridge yet.",
    "After all Underhays death was\naccepted in Africa.",
    "Takes years to upset a thing of this kind  and\nRosaleens evidence was very positive  very positive indeed.",
    "She\nmade a good impression you know.",
    "It seemed almost as though Jeremy Cloade was unwilling to bank upon\nany improvement in his prospects.",
    "I wouldnt like to give a ruling one way or the other he said.",
    "Couldnt say how a case would go.",
    "Then pushing aside some papers with a fretful almost weary gesture\nhe said\n\nBut you wanted to see me\n\nI was going to ask you Mr Cloade if you are really quite certain your\nbrother did not leave a will A will made subsequent to his marriage I\nmean\n\nJeremy looked surprised.",
    "I dont think theres ever been any idea of such a thing.",
    "He certainly\ndidnt make one before leaving New York.",
    "He might have made one during the two days he was in London.",
    "Gone to a lawyer there\n\n\fOr written one out himself.",
    "And got it witnessed Witnessed by whom\n\nThere were three servants in the house Poirot reminded him.",
    "Three\nservants who died the same night he did.",
    "Hm  yes  but if by any chance he did do what you suggest well the\nwill was destroyed too.",
    "That is just the point.",
    "Lately a great many documents believed to have\nperished completely have actually been deciphered by a new process.",
    "Incinerated inside home safes for instance but not so destroyed that\nthey cannot be read.",
    "Well really M. Poirot that is a most remarkable idea of yours...",
    "Most\nremarkable.",
    "But I dont think  no I really dont believe there is\nanything in it...",
    "So far as I know there was no safe in the house in\nSheffield Terrace.",
    "Gordon kept all valuable papers etc.",
    "at his office and there was certainly no will there.",
    "But one might make inquiries Poirot was persistent.",
    "From the\nA.R.P.",
    "officials for instance You would authorise me to do that\n\nOh certainly  certainly.",
    "Very kind of you to offer to undertake such a\nthing.",
    "But I havent any belief whatever Im afraid in your success.",
    "Still  well it is an off chance I suppose.",
    "You  youll be going back to\nLondon at once then\n\n\fPoirots eyes narrowed.",
    "Jeremys tone had been unmistakably eager.",
    "Going back to London... Did they all want him out of the way\n\nBefore he could answer the door opened and Frances Cloade came\nin.",
    "Poirot was struck by two things.",
    "First by the fact that she looked\nshockingly ill. Secondly by her very strong resemblance to the\nphotograph of her father.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot has come to see us my dear said Jeremy rather\nunnecessarily.",
    "She shook hands with him and Jeremy Cloade immediately outlined to\nher Poirots suggestion about a will.",
    "Frances looked doubtful.",
    "It seems a very outside chance.",
    "M. Poirot is going up to London and will very kindly make inquiries.",
    "Major Porter I understand was an Air Raid Warden in that district\nsaid Poirot.",
    "A curious expression passed over Mrs Cloades face.",
    "She said\n\nWho is Major Porter\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "A retired Army Officer living on his pension.",
    "He really was in Africa\n\nPoirot looked at her curiously.",
    "Certainly Madame.",
    "Why not\n\nShe said almost absently I dont know.",
    "He puzzled me.",
    "Yes Mrs Cloade said Poirot.",
    "I can understand that.",
    "She looked sharply at him.",
    "An expression almost of fear came into her\neyes.",
    "Turning to her husband she said\n\nJeremy I feel very much distressed about Rosaleen.",
    "She is all alone\nat Furrowbank and she must be frightfully upset over Davids arrest.",
    "Would you object if I asked her to come here and stay\n\nDo you really think that is advisable my dear Jeremy sounded\ndoubtful.",
    "Oh  advisable I dont know But one is human.",
    "She is such a helpless\ncreature.",
    "I rather doubt if she will accept.",
    "I can at any rate make the offer.",
    "The lawyer said quietly Do so if it will make you feel happier.",
    "Happier\n\nThe word came out with a strange bitterness.",
    "Then she gave a quick\ndoubtful glance at Poirot.",
    "Poirot murmured formally\n\nI will take my leave now.",
    "She followed him out into the hall.",
    "You are going up to London\n\nI shall go up tomorrow but for twentyfour hours at most.",
    "And then I\nreturn to the Stag  where you will find me Madame if you want me.",
    "She demanded sharply\n\nWhy should I want you\n\nPoirot did not reply to the question merely said\n\nI shall be at the Stag.",
    "Later that night out of the darkness Frances Cloade spoke to her\nhusband.",
    "I dont believe that man is going to London for the reason he said.",
    "I\ndont believe all that about Gordons having made a will.",
    "Do you believe\nit Jeremy\n\nA hopeless rather tired voice answered her\n\nNo Frances.",
    "No  hes going for some other reason.",
    "What reason\n\nIve no idea.",
    "Frances said What are we going to do Jeremy What are we going to\ndo\n\nPresently he answered\n\nI think Frances theres only one thing to be done \n\nChapter 9\n\nArmed with the necessary credentials from Jeremy Cloade Poirot had\ngot the answers to his questions.",
    "They were very definite.",
    "The house\nwas a total wreck.",
    "The site had been cleared only quite recently in\npreparation for rebuilding.",
    "There had been no survivors except for David Hunter and Mrs Cloade.",
    "There had been three servants in the house Frederick Game\nElizabeth Game and Eileen Corrigan.",
    "All three had been killed\n\n\finstantly.",
    "Gordon Cloade had been brought out alive but had died on\nthe way to hospital without recovering consciousness.",
    "Poirot took the names and addresses of the three servants nextofkin.",
    "It is possible he said that they may have spoken to their friends\nsomething in the way of gossip or comment that might give me a\npointer to some information I badly need.",
    "The official to whom he was speaking looked sceptical.",
    "The Games\nhad come from Dorset Eileen Corrigan from County Cork.",
    "Poirot next bent his steps towards Major Porters rooms.",
    "He\nremembered Porters statement that he himself was a Warden and he\nwondered whether he had happened to be on duty on that particular\nnight and whether he had seen anything of the incident in Sheffield\nTerrace.",
    "He had besides other reasons for wanting a word with Major Porter.",
    "As he turned the corner of Edge Street he was startled to see a\npoliceman in uniform standing outside the particular house for which\nhe was making.",
    "There was a ring of small boys and other people\nstanding staring at the house.",
    "Poirots heart sank as he interpreted the signs.",
    "The constable intercepted Poirots advance.",
    "Cant go in here sir he said.",
    "What has happened\n\nYou dont live in the house do you sir\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "Who was it you were wishing to see\n\nI wished to see a Major Porter.",
    "You a friend of his sir\n\nNo I should not describe myself as a friend.",
    "What has happened\n\nGentleman has shot himself I understand.",
    "Ah heres the Inspector.",
    "The door had opened and two figures came out.",
    "One was the local\nInspector the other Poirot recognised as Sergeant Graves from\nWarmsley Vale.",
    "The latter recognised him and promptly made himself\nknown to the Inspector.",
    "Better come inside said the latter.",
    "The three men reentered the house.",
    "They telephoned through to Warmsley Vale Graves explained.",
    "And\nSuperintendent Spence sent me up.",
    "Suicide\n\n\fThe Inspector answered\n\nYes.",
    "Seems a clear case.",
    "Dont know whether having to give evidence\nat the inquest preyed upon his mind.",
    "People are funny that way\nsometimes but I gather hes been depressed lately.",
    "Financial\ndifficulties and one thing and another.",
    "Shot himself with his own\nrevolver.",
    "Poirot asked Is it permitted that I go up\n\nIf you like M. Poirot.",
    "Take M. Poirot up Sergeant.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Graves led the way up to the firstfloor room.",
    "It was much as Poirot\nremembered it the dim colours of the old rugs the books.",
    "Major\nPorter was in the big armchair.",
    "His attitude was almost natural just\nthe head slumped forward.",
    "His right arm hung down at his side  below\nit on the rug lay the revolver.",
    "There was still a very faint smell of acrid\ngunpowder in the air.",
    "About a couple of hours ago they think said Graves.",
    "Nobody heard\nthe shot.",
    "The woman of the house was out shopping.",
    "Poirot was frowning looking down on the quiet figure with the small\nscorched wound in the right temple.",
    "Any idea why he should do it M. Poirot asked Graves.",
    "He was respectful to Poirot because he had seen the Superintendent\nbeing respectful  though his private opinion was that Poirot was one\nof these frightful old dugouts.",
    "Poirot replied absently\n\nYes  yes there was a very good reason.",
    "That is not the difficulty.",
    "His glance shifted to a small table at Major Porters left hand.",
    "There\nwas a big solid glass ashtray on it with a pipe and a box of matches.",
    "Nothing there.",
    "His eyes roamed round the room.",
    "Then he crossed to\nan open rolltop desk.",
    "It was very tidy.",
    "Papers neatly pigeonholed.",
    "A\nsmall leather blotter in the centre a pentray with a pen and two\npencils a box of paperclips and a book of stamps.",
    "All very neat and\norderly.",
    "An ordinary life and an orderly death  of course  that was it that was what was missing\n\nHe said to Graves\n\nDidnt he leave any note  any letter for the coroner\n\nGraves shook his head.",
    "No he didnt  sort of thing one would have expected an exArmy man\nto do.",
    "Yes that is very curious.",
    "Punctilious in life.",
    "Major Porter had not been punctilious in death.",
    "It\nwas all wrong Poirot thought that Porter had left no note.",
    "Bit of a blow for the Cloades this said Graves.",
    "It will set them back.",
    "Theyll have to hunt about for someone else who knew Underhay\nintimately.",
    "He fidgeted slightly.",
    "Anything more you want to see M. Poirot\n\nPoirot shook his head and followed Graves from the room.",
    "On the stairs they met the landlady.",
    "She was clearly enjoying her own\nstate of agitation and started a voluble discourse at once.",
    "Graves\nadroitly detached himself and left Poirot to receive the full spate.",
    "Cant seem to catch my breath properly.",
    "Eart thats what it is.",
    "Angina\nPectoria my mother died of  fell down dead as she was crossing the\nCaledonian Market.",
    "Nearly dropped down myself when I found him oh it did give me a turn Never suspected anything of the kind though\ne ad been low in is spirits for a long time.",
    "Worried over money I think\nand didnt eat enough to keep himself alive.",
    "Not that hed ever accept a\nbite from us.",
    "And then yesterday he ad to go down to a place in\nOatshire  Warmsley Vale  to give evidence at an inquest.",
    "Preyed on\nhis mind that did.",
    "He come back looking awful.",
    "Tramped about all last\nnight.",
    "Up and down  up and down.",
    "A murdered gentleman it was and a\nfriend of his by all accounts.",
    "Poor dear it did upset him.",
    "Up and down\n up and down.",
    "And when I was out doing my bit of shopping  and\naving to queue ever so long for the fish I went up to see if hed like a\nnice cuppa tea  and there he was poor gentleman the revolver\ndropped out of his hand leaning back in his chair.",
    "Gave me an awful\nturn it did.",
    "Ad to ave the police in and everything.",
    "Whats the world\ncoming to thats what I say\n\n\fPoirot said slowly\n\nThe world is becoming a difficult place to live in  except for the\nstrong.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nIt was past eight oclock when Poirot got back to the Stag.",
    "He found a\nnote from Frances Cloade asking him to come and see her.",
    "He went\nout at once.",
    "She was waiting for him in the drawingroom.",
    "He had not seen that\nroom before.",
    "The open windows gave on a walled garden with pear\ntrees in bloom.",
    "There were bowls of tulips on the tables.",
    "The old\nfurniture shone with beeswax and elbowgrease and the brass of the\nfender and coalscuttle were brightly gleaming.",
    "It was Poirot thought a very beautiful room.",
    "You said I should want you M. Poirot.",
    "You were quite right.",
    "There is\nsomething that must be told  and I think you are the best person to tell\nit to.",
    "It is always easier Madame to tell a thing to someone who already\nhas a very good idea of what it is.",
    "You think you know what I am going to say\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Since when \n\nShe left the question unfinished but he replied promptly\n\nSince the moment when I saw the photograph of your father.",
    "The\nfeatures of your family are very strongly marked.",
    "One could not doubt\nthat you and he were of the same family.",
    "The resemblance was equally\nstrong in the man who came here calling himself Enoch Arden.",
    "She sighed  a deep unhappy sigh.",
    "Yes  yes youre right  although poor Charles had a beard.",
    "He was\nmy second cousin M. Poirot somewhat the black sheep of the family.",
    "I\nnever knew him very well but we played together as children  and\nnow Ive brought him to his death  an ugly sordid death \n\nShe was silent for a moment or two.",
    "Poirot said gently\n\nYou will tell me \n\nShe roused herself.",
    "Yes the story has got to be told.",
    "We were desperate for money thats where it begins.",
    "My husband  my husband was in serious\ntrouble  the worst kind of trouble.",
    "Disgrace perhaps imprisonment lay\nahead of him  still lies ahead of him for that matter.",
    "Now understand\nthis M. Poirot the plan I made and carried out was my plan my\n\n\fhusband had nothing to do with it.",
    "It wasnt his sort of plan in any case\n it would have been far too risky.",
    "But Ive never minded taking risks.",
    "And Ive always been I suppose rather unscrupulous.",
    "First of all let\nme say I applied to Rosaleen Cloade for a loan.",
    "I dont know whether\nleft to herself she would have given it to me or not.",
    "But her brother\nstepped in.",
    "He was in an ugly mood and he was or so I thought\nunnecessarily insulting.",
    "When I thought of this scheme I had no\nscruples at all about putting it into operation.",
    "To explain matters I must tell you that my husband had repeated to\nme last year a rather interesting piece of information which he had\nheard at his club.",
    "You were there I believe so I neednt repeat it in\ndetail.",
    "But it opened up the possibility that Rosaleens first husband\nmight not be dead  and of course in that case she would have no right\nat all to any of Gordons money.",
    "It was of course only a vague\npossibility but it was there at the back of our minds a sort of outside\nchance that might possibly come true.",
    "And it flashed into my mind that\nsomething could be done by using that possibility.",
    "Charles my cousin\nwas in this country down on his luck.",
    "Hes been in prison Im afraid\nand he wasnt a scrupulous person but he did well in the war.",
    "I put the\nproposition before him.",
    "It was of course blackmail neither more nor\nless.",
    "But we thought that we had a good chance of getting away with it.",
    "At worst I thought David Hunter would refuse to play.",
    "I didnt think\nthat he would go to the police about it  people like him arent fond of\nthe police.",
    "Her voice hardened.",
    "Our scheme went well.",
    "David fell for it better than we hoped.",
    "Charles\nof course could not definitely pose as Robert Underhay.",
    "Rosaleen\n\n\fcould give that away in a moment.",
    "But fortunately she went up to\nLondon and that left Charles a chance of at least suggesting that he\nmight be Robert Underhay.",
    "Well as I say David appeared to be falling\nfor the scheme.",
    "He was to bring the money on Tuesday evening at nine\noclock.",
    "Instead \n\nHer voice faltered.",
    "We should have known that David was  a dangerous person.",
    "Charles\nis dead  murdered  and but for me he would be alive.",
    "I sent him to his\ndeath.",
    "After a little she went on in a dry voice\n\nYou can imagine what I have felt like ever since.",
    "Nevertheless said Poirot you were quick enough to see a further\ndevelopment of the scheme It was you who induced Major Porter to\nidentify your cousin as Robert Underhay\n\nBut at once she broke out vehemently\n\nNo I swear to you no.",
    "Not that No one was more astonished...\nAstonished We were dumbfounded when this Major Porter came\ndown and gave evidence that Charles  Charles  was Robert\nUnderhay.",
    "I couldnt understand it  I still cant understand it\n\nBut someone went to Major Porter.",
    "Someone persuaded him or\nbribed him  to identify the dead man as Underhay\n\n\fFrances said decisively\n\nIt was not I.",
    "And it was not Jeremy.",
    "Neither of us would do such a\nthing.",
    "Oh I dare say that sounds absurd to you You think that because\nI was ready to blackmail that I would stoop just as easily to fraud.",
    "But\nin my mind the two things are worlds apart.",
    "You must understand that I\nfelt  indeed I still feel  that we have a right to a portion of Gordons\nmoney.",
    "What I had failed to get by fair means I was prepared to get by\nfoul.",
    "But deliberately to swindle Rosaleen out of everything by\nmanufacturing evidence that she was not Gordons wife at all  oh no\nindeed M. Poirot I would not do a thing like that.",
    "Please please\nbelieve me.",
    "I will at least admit said Poirot slowly that every one has their own\nparticular sins.",
    "Yes I will believe that.",
    "Then he looked at her sharply.",
    "Do you know Mrs Cloade that Major Porter shot himself this\nafternoon\n\nShe shrank back her eyes wide and horrified.",
    "Oh no M. Poirot  no\n\nYes Madame.",
    "Major Porter you see was au fond an honest man.",
    "Financially he was in very low water and when temptation came he\nlike many other men failed to resist it.",
    "It may have seemed to him he\ncan have made himself feel that his life was almost morally justified.",
    "He was already deeply prejudiced in his mind against the woman his\n\n\ffriend Underhay had married.",
    "He considered that she had treated his\nfriend disgracefully.",
    "And now this heartless little golddigger had\nmarried a millionaire and had got away with her second husbands\nfortune to the detriment of his own flesh and blood.",
    "It must have\nseemed tempting to him to put a spoke in her wheel  no more than she\ndeserved.",
    "And merely by identifying a dead man he himself would be\nmade secure for the future.",
    "When the Cloades got their rights he\nwould get his cut...",
    "Yes  I can see the temptation...",
    "But like many men\nof his type he lacked imagination.",
    "He was unhappy very unhappy at\nthe inquest.",
    "One could see that.",
    "In the near future he would have to\nrepeat his lie upon oath.",
    "Not only that a man was now arrested\ncharged with murder  and the identity of the dead man supplied a very\npotent motive for that charge.",
    "He went back home and faced things squarely.",
    "He took the way out\nthat seemed best to him.",
    "He shot himself\n\nYes.",
    "Frances murmured He didnt say who  who \n\nSlowly Poirot shook his head.",
    "He had his code.",
    "There was no reference whatever as to who had\ninstigated him to commit perjury.",
    "He watched her closely.",
    "Was there an instant flash of relief of relaxed\ntension Yes but that might be natural enough in any case...\n\n\fShe got up and walked to the window.",
    "She said\n\nSo we are back where we were.",
    "Poirot wondered what was passing in her mind.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nSuperintendent Spence the following morning used almost Frances\nwords\n\nSo were back where we started he said with a sigh.",
    "Weve got to\nfind out who this fellow Enoch Arden really was.",
    "I can tell you that.",
    "Superintendent said Poirot.",
    "His name was\nCharles Trenton.",
    "Charles Trenton The Superintendent whistled.",
    "Hm One of the\nTrentons  I suppose she put him up to it  Mrs Jeremy I mean...",
    "However we shant be able to prove her connection with it.",
    "Charles\nTrenton I seem to remember \n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "He has a record.",
    "Thought so.",
    "Swindling hotels if I remember rightly.",
    "Used to arrive at\nthe Ritz go out and buy a Rolls subject to a mornings trial go round\nin the Rolls to all the most expensive shops and buy stuff  and I can tell\nyou a man whos got his Rolls outside waiting to take his purchases\nback to the Ritz doesnt get his cheques queried Besides he had the\nmanner and the breeding.",
    "Hed stay a week or so and then just when\nsuspicions began to arise hed quietly disappear selling the various\nitems cheap to the pals hed picked up.",
    "Charles Trenton.",
    "Hm  He\nlooked at Poirot.",
    "You find out things dont you\n\nHow does your case progress against David Hunter\n\nWe shall have to let him go.",
    "There was a woman there that night with\nArden.",
    "It doesnt only depend on that old tartars word.",
    "Jimmy Pierce\nwas going home got pushed out of the Load of Hay  he gets\nquarrelsome after a glass or two.",
    "He saw a woman come out of the\nStag and go into the telephone box outside the post office  that was\njust after ten.",
    "Said it wasnt any one he knew thought it was someone\nstaying at the Stag.",
    "A tart from London is what he called her.",
    "He was not very near her\n\nNo right across the street.",
    "Who the devil was she M. Poirot\n\nDid he say how she was dressed\n\nTweed coat he said orange scarf round her head.",
    "Trousers and a lot\nof makeup.",
    "Fits with the old ladys description.",
    "Yes it fits Poirot was frowning.",
    "Spence asked\n\nWell who was she where did she come from where did she go You\nknow our train service.",
    "The 9.20s the last train up to London  and the\n10.30 the other way.",
    "Did that woman hang about all night and go up on\nthe 6.18 in the morning Had she got a car Did she hitchhike Weve\nsent out all over the place  but no results.",
    "What about the 6.18\n\nIts always crowded  mostly men though.",
    "I think theyd have noticed\na woman  that type of woman thats to say.",
    "I suppose she might have\ncome and left by car but a cars noticed in Warmsley Vale nowadays.",
    "Were off the main road you see.",
    "No cars noticed out that night\n\nOnly Dr Cloades.",
    "He was out on a case  over Middlingham way.",
    "Youd think someone would have noticed a strange woman in a car.",
    "It need not have been a stranger Poirot said slowly.",
    "A man slightly\ndrunk and a hundred yards away might not recognise a local person\nwhom he did not know very well.",
    "Someone perhaps dressed in a\ndifferent way from their usual way.",
    "Spence looked at him questioningly.",
    "Would this young Pierce recognise for instance Lynn Marchmont\nShe has been away for some years.",
    "Lynn Marchmont was at the White House with her mother at that\ntime said Spence.",
    "Are you sure\n\nMrs Lionel Cloade  thats the scatty one the doctors wife  says she\ntelephoned to her there at ten minutes past ten.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade was\nin London.",
    "Mrs Jeremy  well Ive never seen her in slacks and she\ndoesnt use much makeup.",
    "Anyway she isnt young.",
    "Oh mon cher Poirot leaned forward.",
    "On a dim night with feeble\nstreet lights can one tell youth or age under a mask of makeup\n\nLook here Poirot said Spence what are you getting at\n\nPoirot leaned back and halfclosed his eyes.",
    "Slacks a tweed coat an orange scarf enveloping the head a great\ndeal of makeup a dropped lipstick.",
    "It is suggestive.",
    "Think youre the oracle at Delphi growled the Superintendent.",
    "Not\nthat I know what the oracle at Delphi was  sort of thing young Graves\ngives himself airs about knowing  doesnt help his police work any.",
    "Any more cryptic pronouncements M. Poirot\n\nI told you said Poirot that this case was the wrong shape.",
    "As an\ninstance I said to you that the dead man was all wrong.",
    "So he was as\nUnderhay.",
    "Underhay was clearly an eccentric chivalrous individual\noldfashioned and reactionary.",
    "The man at the Stag was a blackmailer\n\n\fhe was neither chivalrous oldfashioned nor reactionary nor was he\nparticularly eccentric  therefore he was not Underhay.",
    "He could not\nbe Underhay for people do not change.",
    "The interesting thing was that\nPorter said he was Underhay.",
    "Leading you to Mrs Jeremy\n\nThe likeness led me to Mrs Jeremy.",
    "A very distinctive case of\ncountenance the Trenton profile.",
    "To permit myself a little play on\nwords as Charles Trenton the dead man is the right shape.",
    "But there\nare still questions to which we require answers.",
    "Why did David Hunter\npermit himself to be blackmailed so readily Is he the kind of man who\nlets himself be blackmailed One would say very decidedly no.",
    "So he\ntoo acts out of character.",
    "Then there is Rosaleen Cloade.",
    "Her whole\nbehaviour is incomprehensible  but there is one thing I should like to\nknow very much.",
    "Why is she afraid Why does she think that\nsomething will happen to her now that her brother is no longer there to\nprotect her Someone  or something has given her that fear.",
    "And it is\nnot that she fears losing her fortune  no it is more than that.",
    "It is for\nher life that she is afraid...\n\nGood Lord M. Poirot you dont think \n\nLet us remember Spence that as you said just now we are back\nwhere we started.",
    "That is to say the Cloade family are back where\nthey started.",
    "Robert Underhay died in Africa.",
    "And Rosaleen Cloades\nlife stands between them and the enjoyment of Gordon Cloades\nmoney \n\nDo you honestly think that one of them would do that\n\n\fI think this.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade is twentysix and though mentally\nsomewhat unstable physically she is strong and healthy.",
    "She may live\nto be seventy she may live longer still.",
    "Fortyfour years let us say.",
    "Dont you think.",
    "Superintendent that fortyfour years may be too long\nfor someone to contemplate\n\nChapter 12\n\nWhen Poirot left the police station he was almost at once accosted by\nAunt Kathie.",
    "She had several shoppingbags with her and came up to\nhim with a breathless eagerness of manner.",
    "So terrible about poor Major Porter she said.",
    "I cant help feeling\nthat his outlook on life must have been very materialistic.",
    "Army life\nyou know.",
    "Very narrowing and though he had spent a good deal of his\nlife in India Im afraid he never took advantage of the spiritual\nopportunities.",
    "It would be all pukka and chota hazri and tiffin and pigsticking  the narrow Army round.",
    "To think that he might have sat as a\nchela at the feet of some guru Ah the missed opportunities M. Poirot\nhow sad they are\n\nAunt Kathie shook her head and relaxed her grip on one of the\nshoppingbags.",
    "A depressedlooking bit of cod slipped out and slithered into the\ngutter.",
    "Poirot retrieved it and in her agitation Aunt Kathie let a second\nbag slip whereupon a tin of golden syrup began a gay career rolling\nalong the High Street.",
    "Thank you so much M. Poirot Aunt Kathie grasped the cod.",
    "He ran\nafter the golden syrup.",
    "Oh thank you  so clumsy of me  but really I\nhave been so upset.",
    "That unfortunate man  yes it is sticky but really I\ndont like to use your clean handkerchief.",
    "Well its very kind of you  as\nI was saying in life we are in death  and in death we are in life  I\nshould never be surprised to see the astral body of any of my dear\nfriends who have passed over.",
    "One might you know just pass them in\nthe street.",
    "Why  only the other night I \n\nYou permit Poirot rammed the cod firmly into the depths of the bag.",
    "You were saying  yes\n\nAstral bodies said Aunt Kathie.",
    "I asked you know for twopence because I only had halfpennies.",
    "But I thought at the time the face was\nfamiliar  only I couldnt place it.",
    "I still cant  but I think now it must be\nsomeone who has Passed Over  perhaps some time ago  so that my\nremembrance was very uncertain.",
    "It is wonderful the way people are\nsent to one in ones need  even if its only a matter of pennies for\ntelephones.",
    "Oh dear quite a queue at Peacocks  they must have got\neither trifle or Swiss roll I hope Im not too late\n\nMrs Lionel Cloade plunged across the road and joined herself to the\ntail end of a queue of grimfaced women outside the confectioners\nshop.",
    "Poirot went on down the High Street.",
    "He did not turn in at the Stag.",
    "Instead he bent his steps towards the White House.",
    "He wanted very much to have a talk with Lynn Marchmont and he\nsuspected that Lynn Marchmont would not be averse to having a talk\nwith him.",
    "It was a lovely morning  one of those summer mornings in spring that\nhave a freshness denied to a real summers day.",
    "Poirot turned off from the main road.",
    "He saw the footpath leading up\npast Long Willows to the hillside above Furrowbank.",
    "Charles Trenton had come that way from the station on the Friday\nbefore his death.",
    "On his way down the hill he had met Rosaleen\nCloade coming up.",
    "He had not recognised her which was not\nsurprising since he was not Robert Underhay and she naturally had\nnot recognised him for the same reason.",
    "But she had sworn when\nshown the body that she had never seen that man before.",
    "Did she say\nthat for safetys sake Or had she been that day so lost in thought\nthat she had not even glanced at the face of the man she had passed\non the footpath If so what had she been thinking about Had she by\nany chance been thinking of Rowley Cloade\n\nPoirot turned along the small side road which led to the White House.",
    "The garden of the White House was looking very lovely.",
    "It held many\nflowering shrubs lilacs and laburnums and in the centre of the lawn\nwas a big old gnarled apple tree.",
    "Under it stretched out in a\ndeckchair was Lynn Marchmont.",
    "She jumped nervously when Poirot in a formal voice wished her\nGood morning\n\n\fYou did startle me M. Poirot.",
    "I didnt hear you coming across the\ngrass.",
    "So you are still here  in Warmsley Vale\n\nI am still here  yes.",
    "Why\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "It is a pleasant outoftheworld spot where one can relax.",
    "I relax.",
    "Im glad you are here said Lynn.",
    "You do not say to me like the rest of your family When do you go\nback to London M. Poirot and wait anxiously for the answer.",
    "Do they want you to go back to London\n\nIt would seem so.",
    "I dont.",
    "No  I realise that.",
    "Why Mademoiselle\n\nBecause it means that youre not satisfied.",
    "Not satisfied I mean that\nDavid Hunter did it.",
    "And you want him so much  to be innocent\n\nHe saw a faint flush creep up under her bronzed skin.",
    "Naturally I dont want to see a man hanged for what he didnt do.",
    "Naturally  oh yes\n\nAnd the police are simply prejudiced against him because hes got\ntheir backs up.",
    "Thats the worst of David  he likes antagonising\npeople.",
    "The police are not so prejudiced as you think.",
    "Miss Marchmont.",
    "The\nprejudice against him was in the minds of the jury.",
    "They refused to\nfollow the coroners guidance.",
    "They gave a verdict against him and so\nthe police had to arrest him.",
    "But I may tell you that they are very far\nfrom satisfied with the case against him.",
    "She said eagerly\n\nThen they may let him go\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Who do they think did it M. Poirot\n\nPoirot said slowly There was a woman at the Stag that night.",
    "Lynn cried\n\nI dont understand anything.",
    "When we thought the man was Robert\nUnderhay it all seemed so simple.",
    "Why did Major Porter say it was\n\n\fUnderhay if it wasnt Why did he shoot himself Were back now\nwhere we started.",
    "You are the third person to use that phrase\n\nAm I She looked startled.",
    "What are you doing M. Poirot\n\nTalking to people.",
    "That is what I do.",
    "Just talk to people.",
    "But you dont ask them things about the murder\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "No I just  what shall we say  pick up gossip.",
    "Does that help\n\nSometimes it does.",
    "You would be surprised how much I know of the\neveryday life of Warmsley Vale in the last few weeks.",
    "I know who\nwalked where and who they met and sometimes what they said.",
    "For\ninstance I know that the man Arden took the footpath to the village\npassing by Furrowbank and asking the way of Mr Rowley Cloade and\nthat he had a pack on his back and no luggage.",
    "I know that Rosaleen\nCloade had spent over an hour at the farm with Rowley Cloade and\nthat she had been happy there unlike her usual self.",
    "Yes said Lynn Rowley told me that.",
    "He said she was like someone\nhaving an afternoon out.",
    "Aha he said that Poirot paused and went on Yes I know a lot of\nthe comings and goings.",
    "And I have heard a lot about peoples\ndifficulties  yours and your mothers for example.",
    "Theres no secret about any of us said Lynn.",
    "Weve all tried to\ncadge money off Rosaleen.",
    "Thats what you mean isnt it\n\nI did not say so.",
    "Well its true And I suppose youve heard things about me and\nRowley and David.",
    "But you are going to marry Rowley Cloade\n\nAm I I wish I knew... Thats what I was trying to decide that day when David burst out of the wood.",
    "It was like a great question mark in\nmy brain.",
    "Shall I Shall I Even the train in the valley seemed to be\nasking the same thing.",
    "The smoke made a fine question mark in the\nsky.",
    "Poirots face took on a curious expression.",
    "Lynn misunderstood it.",
    "She\ncried out\n\nOh dont you see M. Poirot its all so difficult.",
    "It isnt a question of\nDavid at all.",
    "Its me Ive changed.",
    "Ive been away for three  four years.",
    "Now Ive come back Im not the same person who went away.",
    "Thats\nthe tragedy everywhere.",
    "People coming home changed having to\nreadjust themselves.",
    "You cant go away and lead a different kind of life\nand not change\n\n\fYou are wrong said Poirot.",
    "The tragedy of life is that people do not\nchange.",
    "She stared at him shaking her head.",
    "He insisted\n\nBut yes.",
    "It is so.",
    "Why did you go away in the first place\n\nWhy I went into the Wrens.",
    "I went on service.",
    "Yes yes but why did you join the Wrens in the first place You were\nengaged to be married.",
    "You were in love with Rowley Cloade.",
    "You\ncould have worked could you not as a land girl here in Warmsley\nVale\n\nI could have I suppose but I wanted \n\nYou wanted to get away.",
    "You wanted to go abroad to see life.",
    "You\nwanted perhaps to get away from Rowley Cloade... And now you are\nrestless you still want  to get away Oh no Mademoiselle people do\nnot change\n\nWhen I was out East I longed for home Lynn cried defensively.",
    "Yes yes where you are not there you will want to be That will\nalways be so perhaps with you.",
    "You make a picture to yourself you\nsee a picture of Lynn Marchmont coming home...",
    "But the picture does\nnot come true because the Lynn Marchmont whom you imagine is not\nthe real Lynn Marchmont.",
    "She is the Lynn Marchmont you would like\nto be.",
    "Lynn asked bitterly\n\nSo according to you I shall never be satisfied anywhere\n\nI do not say that.",
    "But I do say that when you went away you were\ndissatisfied with your engagement and that now you have come back\nyou are still dissatisfied with your engagement.",
    "Lynn broke off a leaf and chewed it meditatively.",
    "Youre rather a devil at knowing things arent you M. Poirot\n\nIt is my metier said Poirot modestly.",
    "There is a further truth I think\nthat you have not yet recognised.",
    "Lynn said sharply\n\nYou mean David dont you You think I am in love with David\n\nThat is for you to say murmured Poirot discreetly.",
    "And I  dont know Theres something in David that Im afraid of  but\ntheres something that draws me too...\n\nShe was silent a moment and then went on I was talking yesterday to\nhis Brigadier.",
    "He came down here when he heard David was arrested\nto see what he could do.",
    "Hes been telling me about David how\nincredibly daring he was.",
    "He said David was one of the bravest people\nhed ever had under him.",
    "And yet you know M. Poirot in spite of all he\n\n\fsaid and his praise I had the feeling that he wasnt sure not absolutely\nsure that David hadnt done this\n\nAnd are you not sure either\n\nLynn gave a crooked rather pathetic smile.",
    "No  you see Ive never trusted David.",
    "Can you love someone you\ndont trust\n\nUnfortunately yes.",
    "Ive always been unfair to David  because I didnt trust him.",
    "Ive\nbelieved quite a lot of the beastly local gossip  hints that David wasnt\nDavid Hunter at all  but just a boy friend of Rosaleens.",
    "I was ashamed\nwhen I met the Brigadier and he talked to me about having known\nDavid as a boy in Ireland.",
    "Cest \u00e9patant murmured Poirot how people can get hold of the\nwrong end of a stick\n\nWhat do you mean\n\nJust what I say.",
    "Tell me did Mrs Cloade  the doctors wife I mean did she ring up on the night of the murder\n\nAunt Kathie Yes she did.",
    "What about\n\n\fSome incredible muddle she had got into over some accounts.",
    "Did she speak from her own house\n\nWhy no actually her telephone was out of order.",
    "She had to go out to\na callbox.",
    "At ten minutes past ten\n\nThereabouts.",
    "Our clocks never keep particularly good time.",
    "Thereabouts said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "He went on delicately\n\nThat was not the only telephone call you had that evening\n\nNo.",
    "Lynn spoke shortly.",
    "David Hunter rang you up from London\n\nYes.",
    "She flared out suddenly I suppose you want to know what he\nsaid\n\nOh indeed I should not presume \n\nYoure welcome to know He said he was going away  clearing out of\nmy life.",
    "He said he was no good to me and that he never would run\nstraight  not even for my sake.",
    "And since that was probably true you did not like it said Poirot.",
    "I hope he will go away  that is if he gets acquitted all right...",
    "I hope\ntheyll both go away to America or somewhere.",
    "Then perhaps we\nshall be able to stop thinking about them  well learn to stand on our\nown feet.",
    "Well stop feeling ill will.",
    "Ill will\n\nYes.",
    "I felt it first one night at Aunt Kathies.",
    "She gave a sort of party.",
    "Perhaps it was because I was just back from abroad and rather on\nedge  but I seemed to feel it in the air eddying all round us.",
    "Ill will to\nher  to Rosaleen.",
    "Dont you see we were wishing her dead  all of us\nWishing her dead... And thats awful to wish that someone whos never\ndone you any harm  may die \n\nHer death of course is the only thing that can do you any practical\ngood.",
    "Poirot spoke in a brisk and practical tone.",
    "You mean do us good financially Her mere being here has done us\nharm in all the ways that matter Envying a person resenting them\ncadging off them  it isnt good for one.",
    "Now there she is at\nFurrowbank all alone.",
    "She looks like a ghost  she looks scared to\ndeath  she looks  oh she looks as though shes going off her head.",
    "And she wont let us help Not one of us.",
    "Weve all tried.",
    "Mums asked\nher to come and stay with us.",
    "Aunt Frances asked her there.",
    "Even Aunt\nKathie went along and offered to be with her at Furrowbank.",
    "But she\nwont have anything to do with us now and I dont blame her.",
    "She\n\n\fwouldnt even see Brigadier Conroy.",
    "I think shes ill ill with worry and\nfright and misery.",
    "And were doing nothing about it because she wont\nlet us.",
    "Have you tried You yourself\n\nYes said Lynn.",
    "I went up there yesterday.",
    "I said was there anything\nI could do She looked at me \n\nSuddenly she broke off and shivered.",
    "I think she hates me.",
    "She said\nYou least of all.",
    "David told her I think to stop on at Furrowbank and\nshe always does what David tells her.",
    "Rowley took her up eggs and\nbutter from Long Willows.",
    "I think hes the only one of us she likes.",
    "She\nthanked him and said hed always been kind.",
    "Rowley of course is\nkind.",
    "There are people said Poirot for whom one has great sympathy great pity people who have too heavy a burden to bear.",
    "For Rosaleen\nCloade I have great pity.",
    "If I could I would help her.",
    "Even now if she\nwould listen \n\nWith sudden resolution he got to his feet.",
    "Come Mademoiselle he said let us go up to Furrowbank.",
    "You want me to come with you\n\nIf you are prepared to be generous and understanding \n\nLynn cried\n\n\fI am  indeed I am \n\nChapter 13\n\nIt took them only about five minutes to reach Furrowbank.",
    "The drive\nwound\n\nup\n\nan\n\nincline\n\nthrough\n\ncarefully\n\nmassed\n\nbanks\n\nof\n\nrhododendrons.",
    "No trouble or expense had been spared by Gordon\nCloade to make Furrowbank a showplace.",
    "The parlourmaid who answered the front door looked surprised to see\nthem and a little doubtful as to whether they could see Mrs Cloade.",
    "Madam she said wasnt up yet.",
    "However she ushered them into the\ndrawingroom and went upstairs with Poirots message.",
    "Poirot looked round him.",
    "He was contrasting this room with Frances\nCloades drawingroom  the latter such an intimate room so\ncharacteristic of its mistress.",
    "The drawingroom at Furrowbank was strictly impersonal  speaking\nonly of wealth tempered by good taste.",
    "Gordon Cloade had seen to the\nlatter  everything in the room was of good quality and of artistic merit\nbut there was no sign of any selectiveness no clue to the personal\ntastes of the rooms mistress.",
    "Rosaleen it seemed had not stamped\nupon the place any individuality of her own.",
    "She had lived in\nFurrowbank as a foreign visitor might live at the Ritz or at the Savoy.",
    "I wonder thought Poirot if the other \n\n\fLynn broke the chain of his thought by asking him of what he was\nthinking and why he looked so grim.",
    "The wages of sin Mademoiselle are said to be death.",
    "But sometimes\nthe wages of sin seem to be luxury.",
    "Is that any more endurable I\nwonder To be cut off from ones own home life.",
    "To catch perhaps a\nsingle glimpse of it when the way back to it is barred \n\nHe broke off.",
    "The parlourmaid her superior manner laid aside a mere\nfrightened middleaged woman came running into the room\nstammering and choking with words she could hardly get out.",
    "Oh Miss Marchmont Oh sir the mistress  upstairs  shes very bad she doesnt speak and I cant rouse her and her hands so cold.",
    "Sharply Poirot turned and ran out of the room.",
    "Lynn and the maid\ncame behind him.",
    "He raced up to the first floor.",
    "The parlourmaid\nindicated the open door facing the head of the stairs.",
    "It was a large beautiful bedroom the sun pouring in through the open\nwindows on to pale beautiful rugs.",
    "In the big carved bedstead Rosaleen was lying  apparently asleep.",
    "Her long dark lashes lay on her cheeks her head turned naturally into\nthe pillow.",
    "There was a crumpledup handkerchief in one hand.",
    "She\nlooked like a sad child who had cried itself to sleep.",
    "Poirot picked up her hand and felt for the pulse.",
    "The hand was icecold\nand told him what he already guessed.",
    "He said quietly to Lynn\n\nShe has been dead some time.",
    "She died in her sleep.",
    "Oh sir  oh  what shall we do The parlourmaid burst out crying.",
    "Who was her doctor\n\nUncle Lionel said Lynn.",
    "Poirot said to the parlourmaid Go and telephone to Dr Cloade.",
    "She\nwent out of the room still sobbing.",
    "Poirot moved here and there about\nthe room.",
    "A small white cardboard box beside the bed bore a label One powder\nto be taken at bedtime.",
    "Using his handkerchief he pushed the box\nopen.",
    "There were three powders left.",
    "He moved across to the\nmantelpiece then to the writingtable.",
    "The chair in front of it was pushed aside the blotter was open.",
    "A sheet\nof paper was there with words scrawled in an unformed childish hand.",
    "I dont know what to do...",
    "I cant go on... Ive been so wicked.",
    "I must\ntell someone and get peace...",
    "I didnt mean to he so wicked to begin\nwith.",
    "I didnt know all that was going to come of it.",
    "I must write down \n\nThe words sprawled off in a dash.",
    "The pen lay where it had been flung\ndown.",
    "Poirot stood looking down at those written words.",
    "Lynn still stood by\nthe bed looking down at the dead girl.",
    "Then the door was pushed violently open and David Hunter strode\nbreathlessly into the room.",
    "David Lynn started forward.",
    "Have they released you Im so glad \n\nHe brushed her words aside as he brushed her aside thrusting her\nalmost roughly out of the way as he bent over the still white figure.",
    "Rosa Rosaleen...",
    "He touched her hand then he swung round on\nLynn his face blazing with anger.",
    "His words came high and deliberate\n\nSo youve killed her have you Youve got rid of her at last You got\nrid of me sent me to gaol on a trumpedup charge and then amongst\nyou all you put her out of the way All of you Or just one of you I\ndont care which it is You killed her You wanted the damned money now youve got it Her death gives it to you Youll all be out of Queer\nStreet now.",
    "Youll all be rich  a lot of dirty murdering thieves thats\nwhat you are You werent able to touch her so long as I was by.",
    "I knew\nhow to protect my sister  she was never one to be able to protect\nherself.",
    "But when she was alone here you saw your chance and you\ntook it.",
    "He paused swayed slightly and said in a low quivering voice\nMurderers.",
    "Lynn cried out\n\nNo David.",
    "No youre wrong.",
    "None of us would kill her.",
    "We wouldnt\ndo such a thing.",
    "One of you killed her Lynn Marchmont.",
    "And you know that as well as I\ndo\n\nI swear we didnt David.",
    "I swear we did nothing of the kind.",
    "The wildness of his gaze softened a little.",
    "Maybe it wasnt you Lynn \n\nIt wasnt David I swear it wasnt \n\nHercule Poirot moved forward a step and coughed.",
    "David swung\nround on him.",
    "I think said Poirot that your assumptions are a little overdramatic.",
    "Why jump to the conclusion that your sister was murdered\n\nYou say she wasnt murdered Do you call this  he indicated the\nfigure on the bed  a natural death Rosaleen suffered from nerves\nyes but she had no organic weakness.",
    "Her heart was sound enough.",
    "Last night said Poirot before she went to bed she sat writing here\n\n\nDavid strode past him bent over the sheet of paper.",
    "Do not touch it Poirot warned him.",
    "David drew back his hand and\nread the words as he stood motionless.",
    "He turned his head sharply and looked searchingly at Poirot.",
    "Are you suggesting suicide Why should Rosaleen commit suicide\n\nThe voice that answered the question was not Poirots.",
    "Superintendent\nSpences quiet Oatshire voice spoke from the open doorway\n\nSupposing that last Tuesday night Mrs Cloade wasnt in London but\nin Warmsley Vale Suppose she went to see the man who had been\nblackmailing her Suppose that in a nervous frenzy she killed him\n\nDavid swung round on him.",
    "His eyes were hard and angry.",
    "My sister was in London on Tuesday night.",
    "She was there in the flat\nwhen I got in at eleven oclock.",
    "Yes said Spence thats your story Mr Hunter.",
    "And I dare say youll\nstick to it.",
    "But Im not obliged to believe that story.",
    "And in any case\nisnt it a little late  he gestured towards the bed  the case will never\ncome to court now.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nHe wont admit it said Spence.",
    "But I think he knows she did it.",
    "Sitting in his room at the police station he looked across the table at\nPoirot.",
    "Funny how it was his alibi we were so careful about checking.",
    "We never gave much thought to hers.",
    "And yet theres no corroboration\nat all for her being in the flat in London that night.",
    "Weve only got his\nword that she was there.",
    "We knew all along that only two people had a\nmotive for doing away with Arden  David Hunter and Rosaleen Cloade.",
    "I went baldheaded for him and passed her by.",
    "Fact is she seemed\nsuch a gentle thing  even a bit halfwitted  but I dare say that partly\nexplains it.",
    "Very likely David Hunter hustled her up to London for just\nthat reason.",
    "He may have realised that shed lose her head and he\nmay have known that shes the kind who gets dangerous when they\npanic.",
    "Another funny thing Ive often seen her going about in an\norange linen frock  it was a favourite colour of hers.",
    "Orange scarves a striped orange frock an orange beret.",
    "And yet even when old Mrs\nLeadbetter described a young woman with her head tied up in an\norange scarf I still didnt tumble to it that it must have been Mrs Gordon\nherself.",
    "I still think the girl wasnt quite all there  wasnt wholly\nresponsible.",
    "The way you describe her as haunting the R.C.",
    "church\nhere sounds as though she was half off her head with remorse and a\nsense of guilt.",
    "She had a sense of guilt yes said Poirot.",
    "Spence said thoughtfully She must have attacked Arden in a kind of\nfrenzy.",
    "I dont suppose he had the least idea of what was coming to\nhim.",
    "He wouldnt be on his guard with a slip of a girl like that.",
    "He\nruminated for a moment or two in silence then he remarked Theres\nstill one thing Im not quite clear about.",
    "Who got at Porter You say it\nwasnt Mrs Jeremy Bet you it was all the same\n\nNo said Poirot.",
    "It was not Mrs Jeremy.",
    "She assured me of that and I\nbelieve her.",
    "I have been stupid over that.",
    "I should have known who it\nwas.",
    "Major Porter himself told me.",
    "He told you\n\n\fOh indirectly of course.",
    "He did not know that he had done so.",
    "Well who was it\n\nPoirot put his head a little on one side.",
    "Is it permitted first that I ask you two questions\n\nThe Superintendent looked surprised.",
    "Ask anything you like.",
    "Those sleepingpowders in a box by Rosaleen Cloades bed.",
    "What\nwere they\n\nThe Superintendent looked more surprised.",
    "Those Oh they were quite harmless.",
    "Bromide.",
    "Soothing to the\nnerves.",
    "She took one every night.",
    "We analysed them of course.",
    "They\nwere quite all right.",
    "Who prescribed them\n\nDr Cloade.",
    "When did he prescribe them\n\nOh some time ago.",
    "What poison was it that killed her\n\n\fWell we havent actually got the report yet but I dont think theres\nmuch doubt about it.",
    "Morphia and a pretty hefty dose of it.",
    "Was any morphia found in her possession\n\nSpence looked curiously at the other man.",
    "No.",
    "What are you getting at M. Poirot\n\nI will pass now to my second question said Poirot evasively.",
    "David\nHunter put through a call from London to Lynn Marchmont at 11.05 on\nthat Tuesday night.",
    "You say you checked up on calls.",
    "That was the only\noutgoing call from the flat in Shepherds Court.",
    "Were there any\nincoming calls\n\nOne.",
    "At 10.15.",
    "Also from Warmsley Vale.",
    "It was put through from a\npublic call box.",
    "I see.",
    "Poirot was silent for a moment or two.",
    "Whats the big idea M. Poirot\n\nThat call was answered The operator I mean got a response from\nthe London number.",
    "I see what you mean said Spence slowly.",
    "There must have been\nsomeone in the flat.",
    "It couldnt be David Hunter  he was in the train on\nhis way back.",
    "It looks then as if it must have been Rosaleen Cloade.",
    "And if so Rosaleen Cloade couldnt have been at the Stag a few\n\n\fminutes earlier.",
    "What youre getting at M. Poirot is that the woman in\nthe orange scarf wasnt Rosaleen Cloade.",
    "And if so it wasnt Rosaleen\nCloade who killed Arden.",
    "But then why did she commit suicide\n\nThe answer to that said Poirot is very simple.",
    "She did not commit\nsuicide.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade was killed\n\nWhat\n\nShe was deliberately and coldbloodedly murdered.",
    "But who killed Arden Weve eliminated David \n\nIt was not David.",
    "And now you eliminate Rosaleen But dash it all those two were the\nonly ones with a shadow of motive\n\nYes said Poirot.",
    "Motive.",
    "It was that which has led us astray.",
    "If A has\na motive for killing C and B has a motive for killing D  well it does not\nseem to make sense does it that A should kill D and B should kill C\n\nSpence groaned.",
    "Go easy M. Poirot go easy.",
    "I dont even begin to\nunderstand what you are talking about with your As and Bs and Cs.",
    "It is complicated said Poirot it is very complicated.",
    "Because you\nsee you have here two different kinds of crime  and consequently you\nhave you must have two different murders.",
    "Enter First Murderer and\nenter Second Murderer.",
    "Dont quote Shakespeare groaned Spence.",
    "This isnt Elizabethan\ndrama.",
    "But yes it is very Shakespearian  there are here all the emotions the human emotions  in which Shakespeare would have revelled  the\njealousies the hates  the swift passionate actions.",
    "And here too is\nsuccessful opportunism.",
    "There is a tide in the affairs of men which\ntaken at its flood leads on to Fortune...",
    "Someone acted on that\nSuperintendent.",
    "To seize opportunity and turn it to ones own ends that has been triumphantly accomplished  under your nose so to\nspeak\n\nSpence rubbed his nose irritably.",
    "Talk sense M. Poirot he pleaded.",
    "If its possible just say what you\nmean.",
    "I will be very clear  clear as the crystal.",
    "We have here have we not\nthree deaths You agree to that do you not Three people are dead.",
    "Spence looked at him curiously.",
    "I should certainly say so... Youre not going to make me believe that\none of the three is still alive\n\nNo no said Poirot.",
    "They are dead.",
    "But how did they die How that\nis to say would you classify their deaths\n\n\fWell as to that M. Poirot you know my views.",
    "One murder and two\nsuicides.",
    "But according to you the last suicide isnt a suicide.",
    "Its\nanother murder.",
    "According to me said Poirot there has been one suicide one\naccident and one murder.",
    "Accident Do you mean Mrs Cloade poisoned herself by accident Or\ndo you mean Major Porters shooting himself was an accident\n\nNo said Poirot.",
    "The accident was the death of Charles Trenton otherwise Enoch Arden.",
    "Accident The Superintendent exploded.",
    "Accident You say that a\nparticularly brutal murder where a mans head is stove in by repeated\nblows is an accident\n\nQuite unmoved by the Superintendents vigour Poirot replied calmly\n\nWhen I say an accident I mean that there was no intent to kill.",
    "No intent to kill  when a mans head is battered in Do you mean that\nhe was attacked by a lunatic\n\nI think that that is very near the truth  though not quite in the sense\nyou mean it.",
    "Mrs Gordon was the only batty woman in this case.",
    "Ive seen her\nlooking very queer sometimes.",
    "Of course Mrs Lionel Cloade is a bit\nbats in the belfry  but shed never be violent.",
    "Mrs Jeremy has got her\n\n\fhead screwed on the right way if any one has By the way you say that\nit was not Mrs Jeremy who bribed Porter\n\nNo.",
    "I know who it was.",
    "As I say it was Porter himself who gave it\naway.",
    "One simple little remark  ah I could kick myself as you say all\nround the town for not noticing it at the time.",
    "And then your anonymous A B C lunatic murdered Rosaleen Cloade\nSpences voice was more and more sceptical.",
    "Poirot shook his head vigorously.",
    "By no means.",
    "This is where the First Murderer exits and Second\nMurderer enters.",
    "Quite a different type of crime this no heat and no\npassion.",
    "Cold deliberate murder and I intend.",
    "Superintendent Spence\nto see that her murderer is hanged for that murder.",
    "He got up as he spoke and moved towards the door.",
    "Hi cried Spence.",
    "Youve got to give me a few names.",
    "You cant\nleave it like this.",
    "In a very little while  yes I will tell you.",
    "But there is something for\nwhich I wait  to be exact a letter from across the sea.",
    "Dont talk like a ruddy fortuneteller Hi  Poirot.",
    "But Poirot had slipped away.",
    "He went straight across the square and rang the bell of Dr Cloades\nhouse.",
    "Mrs Cloade came to the door and gave her usual gasp at seeing Poirot.",
    "He wasted no time.",
    "Madame I must speak to you.",
    "Oh of course  do come in  Im afraid I havent had much time to dust\nbut \n\nI want to ask you something.",
    "How long has your husband been a\nmorphia addict\n\nAunt Kathie immediately burst into tears.",
    "Oh dear oh dear  I did so hope nobody would ever know  it began in\nthe war.",
    "He was so dreadfully overtired and had such dreadful\nneuralgia.",
    "And since then hes been trying to lessen the dose  he has\nindeed.",
    "But thats what makes him so dreadfully irritable sometimes \n\nThat is one of the reasons why he has needed money is it not\n\nI suppose so.",
    "Oh dear M. Poirot.",
    "He has promised to go for a cure \n\nCalm yourself Madame and answer me one more little question.",
    "On\nthe night when you telephoned to Lynn Marchmont you went out to the\ncallbox outside the post office did you not Did you meet anybody in\nthe square that night\n\n\fOh no M. Poirot not a soul.",
    "But I understood you had to borrow tuppence because you had only\nhalfpennies.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "I had to ask a woman who came out of the box.",
    "She gave me\ntwo pennies for four halfpennies \n\nWhat did she look like this woman\n\nWell rather actressy if you know what I mean.",
    "An orange scarf round\nher head.",
    "The funny thing was that Im almost sure Id met her\nsomewhere.",
    "Her face seemed very familiar.",
    "She must I think have\nbeen someone who had passed over.",
    "And yet you know I couldnt\nremember where and how I had known her.",
    "Thank you Mrs Cloade said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nLynn came out of the house and glanced up at the sky.",
    "The sun was getting low there was no red in the sky but a rather\nunnatural glow of light.",
    "A still evening with a breathless feel about it.",
    "There would be she thought a storm later.",
    "Well the time had come now.",
    "She couldnt put things off any longer.",
    "She must go to Long Willows and tell Rowley.",
    "She owed him that at\nleast  to tell him herself.",
    "Not to choose the easy way of the written\nword.",
    "Her mind was made up  quite made up  she told herself and yet she\nfelt a curious reluctance.",
    "She looked round her and thought Its\ngoodbye to all this  to my own world  my own way of life.",
    "For she had no illusions.",
    "Life with David was a gamble  an adventure\nthat was as likely to turn out badly as to turn out well.",
    "He himself had\nwarned her...",
    "The night of the murder over the telephone.",
    "And now a few hours ago he had said\n\nI meant to go out of your life.",
    "I was a fool  to think I could leave you\nbehind me.",
    "Well go to London and be married by special licence  oh\nyes Im not going to give you the chance of shillyshallying about.",
    "Youve got roots here roots that hold you down.",
    "Ive got to pull you up\nby the roots.",
    "He had added Well break it to Rowley when youre\nactually Mrs David Hunter.",
    "Poor devil its the best way to break it to\nhim.",
    "But to that she did not agree though she had not said so at the time.",
    "No she must tell Rowley herself.",
    "It was to Rowley she was going now\n\nThe storm was just starting as Lynn tapped at the door of Long\nWillows.",
    "Rowley opened it and looked astonished to see her.",
    "Hallo Lynn why didnt you ring up and say you were coming I might\nhave been out.",
    "I want to talk to you Rowley.",
    "He stood aside to let her pass and followed her into the big kitchen.",
    "The remains of his supper were on the table.",
    "Im planning to get an Aga or an Esse put in here he said.",
    "Easier for\nyou.",
    "And a new sink  steel \n\nShe interrupted.",
    "Dont make plans Rowley.",
    "You mean because that poor kid isnt buried yet I suppose it does\nseem rather heartless.",
    "But she never struck me as a particularly\nhappy person.",
    "Sickly I suppose.",
    "Never got over that damned Air Raid.",
    "Anyway there it is.",
    "Shes dead and in her grave and oh the difference\nto me  or rather to us \n\nLynn caught her breath.",
    "No Rowley.",
    "There isnt any us.",
    "Thats what I came to tell you.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "She said quietly hating herself but steadfast in her\npurpose\n\nIm going to marry David Hunter Rowley.",
    "She did not know quite what she expected  protests perhaps an\nangry outburst  but she certainly did not expect Rowley to take it as he\ndid.",
    "He stared at her for a minute or two then he went across and poked at\nthe stove turning at last in an almost absentminded manner.",
    "Well he said lets get it clear Youre going to marry David Hunter.",
    "Why\n\nBecause I love him.",
    "You love me.",
    "No.",
    "I did love you  when I went away.",
    "But its been four years and Ive\n Ive changed.",
    "Weve both changed.",
    "Youre wrong... he said quietly.",
    "I havent changed.",
    "Well perhaps you havent changed so much.",
    "I havent changed at all.",
    "I havent had much chance to change.",
    "Ive\njust gone plodding on here.",
    "I havent dropped from parachutes or\nswarmed up cliffs by night or wound an arm round a man in the\ndarkness and stabbed him \n\nRowley \n\n\fI havent been to the war.",
    "I havent fought.",
    "I dont know what war is\nIve led a nice safe life here down on the farm.",
    "Lucky Rowley But as a\nhusband youd be ashamed of me\n\nNo Rowley  oh no It isnt that at all.",
    "But I tell you it is He came nearer to her.",
    "The blood was welling up in\nhis neck the veins of his forehead were starting out.",
    "That look in his\neyes  she had seen it once as she passed a bull in a field.",
    "Tossing its\nhead stamping its foot slowly lowering its head with the great horns.",
    "Goaded to a dull fury a blind rage...\n\nBe quiet Lynn youll listen to me for a change.",
    "Ive missed what I\nought to have had.",
    "Ive missed my chance of fighting for my country.",
    "Ive seen my best friend go and be killed.",
    "Ive seen my girl  my girl dress up in uniform and go overseas.",
    "Ive been Just the Man She Left\nBehind Her.",
    "My lifes been hell  dont you understand Lynn Its been\nHell.",
    "And then you came back  and since then its been worse Hell.",
    "Ever since that night at Aunt Kathies when I saw you looking at David\nHunter across the table.",
    "But hes not going to have you do you hear If\nyoure not for me then no one shall have you.",
    "What do you think I am\n\nRowley \n\nShe had risen was retreating a step at a time.",
    "She was terrified.",
    "This\nman was not a man any longer he was a brute beast.",
    "Ive killed two people said Rowley Cloade.",
    "Do you think I shall stick\nat killing a third\n\n\fRowley \n\nHe was upon her now his hands round her throat...",
    "I cant bear any more Lynn \n\nThe hands tightened round her neck the room whirled blackness\nspinning blackness suffocation  everything going dark...\n\nAnd then suddenly a cough.",
    "A prim slightly artificial cough.",
    "Rowley paused his hands relaxed fell to his sides.",
    "Lynn released\nsank in a crumpled heap on the floor.",
    "Just inside the door Hercule Poirot stood apologetically coughing.",
    "I hope he said that I do not intrude I knocked.",
    "Yes indeed I\nknocked but no one answered...",
    "I suppose you were busy\n\nFor a moment the air was tense electric.",
    "Rowley stared.",
    "It looked for a moment as though he might fling himself\non Hercule Poirot but finally he turned away.",
    "He said in a flat empty voice\n\nYou turned up  just in the nick of time.",
    "Chapter 16\n\n\fInto an atmosphere quivering with danger Hercule Poirot brought his\nown atmosphere of deliberate anticlimax.",
    "The kettle it is boiling he inquired.",
    "Rowley said heavily  stupidly  Yes its boiling.",
    "Then you will perhaps make some coffee Or some tea if it is\neasier.",
    "Like an automaton Rowley obeyed.",
    "Hercule Poirot took a large clean handkerchief from his pocket he\nsoaked it in cold water wrung it out and came to Lynn.",
    "There Mademoiselle if you fasten that round your throat  so.",
    "Yes I\nhave the safetypin.",
    "There that will at once ease the pain.",
    "Croaking hoarsely Lynn thanked him.",
    "The kitchen of Long Willows Poirot fussing about  it all had for her the\nquality of a nightmare.",
    "She felt horribly ill and her throat was paining\nher badly.",
    "She staggered to her feet and Poirot guided her gently to a\nchair and put her into it.",
    "There he said and over his shoulder\n\nThe coffee he demanded.",
    "Its ready said Rowley.",
    "He brought it.",
    "Poirot poured out a cup and took it to Lynn.",
    "Look here said Rowley I dont think you understand.",
    "I tried to\nstrangle Lynn.",
    "Tscha tscha said Poirot in a vexed voice.",
    "He seemed to be\ndeploring a lapse of bad taste on Rowleys part.",
    "Two deaths Ive got on my conscience said Rowley.",
    "Hers would\nhave been the third  if you hadnt arrived.",
    "Let us drink up our coffee said Poirot and not talk of deaths.",
    "It is\nnot agreeable for Mademoiselle Lynn.",
    "My God said Rowley.",
    "He stared at Poirot.",
    "Lynn sipped her coffee with difficulty.",
    "It was hot and strong.",
    "Presently\nshe felt her throat less painful and the stimulant began to act.",
    "There that is better yes said Poirot.",
    "She nodded.",
    "Now we can talk said Poirot.",
    "When I say that I mean really that I\nshall talk.",
    "How much do you know said Rowley heavily.",
    "Do you know that I\nkilled Charles Trenton\n\n\fYes said Poirot.",
    "I have known that for some time.",
    "The door burst open.",
    "It was David Hunter.",
    "Lynn he cried.",
    "You never told me \n\nHe stopped puzzled his eyes going from one to the other.",
    "Whats the matter with your throat\n\nAnother cup said Poirot.",
    "Rowley took one from the dresser.",
    "Poirot\nreceived it filled it with coffee and handed it to David.",
    "Once more\nPoirot dominated the situation.",
    "Sit down he said to David.",
    "We will sit here and drink coffee and you\nshall all three listen to Hercule Poirot while he gives you a lecture on\ncrime.",
    "He looked round on them and nodded his head.",
    "Lynn thought\n\nThis is some fantastic nightmare.",
    "It isnt real\n\nThey were all it seemed under the sway of this absurd little man with\nthe big moustaches.",
    "They sat there obediently  Rowley the killer she\nhis victim David the man who loved her  all holding cups of coffee\nlistening to this little man who in some strange way dominated them\nall.",
    "What causes crime Hercule Poirot demanded rhetorically.",
    "It is a\nquestion that.",
    "What stimulus is needed What inbred predisposition\ndoes there have to be Is every one capable of crime  of some crime\nAnd what happens  that is what I have asked myself from the\nbeginning what happens when people who have been protected from\nreal life  from its assaults and ravages  are suddenly deprived of that\nprotection\n\nI am speaking you see of the Cloades.",
    "There is only one Cloade\nhere and so I can speak very freely.",
    "From the beginning the problem\nhas fascinated me.",
    "Here is a whole family whose circumstances have\nprevented from ever having to stand on their own feet.",
    "Though each\none of the family had a life of his or her own a profession yet really\nthey have never escaped from the shadow of a beneficent protection.",
    "They have had always freedom from fear.",
    "They have lived in security and a security which was unnatural and artificial.",
    "Gordon Cloade was\nalways there behind them.",
    "What I say to you is this there is no telling what a human character is\nuntil the test comes.",
    "To most of us the test comes early in life.",
    "A man is\nconfronted quite soon with the necessity to stand on his own feet to\nface dangers and difficulties and to take his own line of dealing with\nthem.",
    "It may be the straight way it may be the crooked way whichever it is a man usually learns early just what he is made of.",
    "But the Cloades had no opportunity of knowing their own weaknesses\nuntil the time when they were suddenly shorn of protection and were\nforced quite unprepared to face difficulty.",
    "One thing and one thing\nonly stood between them and the resumption of security the life of\nRosaleen Cloade.",
    "I am quite certain in my own mind that every single\n\n\fone of the Cloades thought at one time or another If Rosaleen was to\ndie \n\nLynn shivered.",
    "Poirot paused letting the words sink in then went on\n\nThe thought of death her death passed through every mind  of that I\nam certain.",
    "Did the further thought of murder pass through also And\ndid the thought in one particular instance go beyond thinking and\nbecame action.",
    "Without a change of voice he turned to Rowley\n\nDid you think of killing her\n\nYes said Rowley.",
    "It was the day she came to the farm.",
    "There was\nno one else there.",
    "I thought then  I could kill her quite easily.",
    "She\nlooked pathetic  and very pretty  like the calves Id sent to market.",
    "You can see how pathetic they are  but you send them off just the\nsame.",
    "I wondered really that she wasnt afraid... She would have\nbeen if shed known what was in my mind...",
    "Yes it was in my mind\nwhen I took the lighter from her to light her cigarette.",
    "She left it behind I suppose.",
    "Thats how you got hold of it.",
    "Rowley nodded.",
    "I dont know why I didnt kill her he said wonderingly.",
    "I thought of it.",
    "One could have faked it up as an accident or something.",
    "It was not your type of crime said Poirot.",
    "That is the answer.",
    "The\nman you did kill you killed in a rage  and you did not really mean to kill\nhim I fancy\n\nGood Lord no.",
    "I hit him on the jaw.",
    "He went over backwards and hit\nhis head on that marble fender.",
    "I couldnt believe it when I found he\nwas dead.",
    "Then suddenly he shot a startled glance at Poirot\n\nHow did you know that\n\nI think said Poirot that I have reconstructed your actions fairly\naccurately.",
    "You shall tell me if I am wrong.",
    "You went to the Stag did\nyou not and Beatrice Lippincott told you about the conversation she\nhad overheard Thereupon you went as you have said to your\nuncles Jeremy Cloade to get his opinion as a solicitor upon the\nposition.",
    "Now something happened there something that made you\nchange your mind about consulting him.",
    "I think I know what that\nsomething was.",
    "You saw a photograph \n\nRowley nodded.",
    "Yes it was on the desk.",
    "I suddenly realised the likeness.",
    "I realised too\nwhy the fellows face had seemed so familiar.",
    "I tumbled to it that\nJeremy and Frances were getting some relation of hers to put up a\nstunt and get money out of Rosaleen.",
    "It made me see red.",
    "I went\nheadlong back to the Stag and up to No.",
    "5 and accused the fellow of\nbeing a fraud.",
    "He laughed and admitted it  said David Hunter was\ngoing to come across all right with the money that very evening.",
    "I just\n\n\fsaw red when I realised that my own family was as I saw it doublecrossing me.",
    "I called him a swine and hit him.",
    "He went down as I said.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Poirot said And then\n\nIt was the lighter said Rowley slowly.",
    "It fell out of my pocket.",
    "Id\nbeen carrying it about meaning to give it back to Rosaleen when I saw\nher.",
    "It fell down on the body and I saw the initials D.H.",
    "It was Davids\nnot hers.",
    "Ever since that party at Aunt Kathies Id realised  well never mind all\nthat.",
    "Ive sometimes thought Im going mad  perhaps I am a bit mad.",
    "First Johnny going  and then the war  I  I cant talk about things but\nsometimes Id feel blind with rage  and now Lynn  and this fellow.",
    "I\ndragged the dead man into the middle of the room and turned him over\non his face.",
    "Then I picked up those heavy steel tongs  well I wont go\ninto details.",
    "I wiped off fingerprints cleaned up the marble curb  then\nI deliberately put the hands of the wristwatch at ten minutes past nine\nand smashed it.",
    "I took away his ration book and his papers  I thought\nhis identity might be traced through them.",
    "Then I got out.",
    "It seemed to\nme that with Beatrices story of what shed overheard David would be\nfor it all right.",
    "Thanks said David.",
    "And then said Poirot you came to me.",
    "It was a pretty little comedy\nthat you played there was it not asking me to produce some witness\nthat knew Underhay It was already clear to me that Jeremy Cloade\nhad repeated to his family the story that Major Porter had told.",
    "For\nnearly two years all the family had cherished a secret hope that\n\n\fUnderhay might turn up.",
    "That wish influenced Mrs Lionel Cloade in her\nmanipulation of the Ouija board  unconsciously but it was a very\nrevealing incident.",
    "Eh bien I perform my conjuring trick.",
    "I flatter myself that I impress\nyou and really it is I who am the complete mug.",
    "Yes and there in Major\nPorters room he says after he offers me a cigarette he says to you\nYou dont do you\n\nHow did he know that you did not smoke He is supposed only that\nmoment to have met you.",
    "Imbecile that I am I should have seen the\ntruth then  that already you and Major Porter you had made your little\narrangement together No wonder he was nervous that morning.",
    "Yes I\nam to be the mug I am to bring Major Porter down to identify the body.",
    "But I do not go on being the mug for ever  no I am not the mug now\nam I\n\nHe looked round angrily and then went on\n\nBut then.",
    "Major Porter went back on that arrangement.",
    "He does not\ncare to be a witness upon oath in a murder trial and the strength of\nthe case against David Hunter depends very largely upon the identity\nof the dead man.",
    "So Major Porter backs out.",
    "He wrote to me he wouldnt go through with it said Rowley thickly.",
    "The damned fool.",
    "Didnt he see wed gone too far to stop I came up\nto try to drive some sense into him.",
    "I was too late.",
    "Hed said hed rather\nshoot himself than perjure himself when it was a question of murder.",
    "The front door wasnt locked  I went up and found him.",
    "I cant tell you what I felt like.",
    "It was as though I was a murderer twice\nover.",
    "If only hed waited  if hed only let me talk to him.",
    "There was a note there Poirot asked.",
    "You took it away\n\nYes  I was in for things now.",
    "Might as well go the whole hog.",
    "The note\nwas to the coroner.",
    "It simply said that hed given perjured evidence at\nthe inquest.",
    "The dead man was not Robert Underhay.",
    "I took the note\naway and destroyed it.",
    "Rowley struck his fist on the table.",
    "It was like a bad dream  a horrible nightmare Id begun this thing and\nId got to go on with it.",
    "I wanted the money to get Lynn  and I wanted\nHunter to hang.",
    "And then  I couldnt understand it  the case against\nhim broke down.",
    "Some story about a woman  a woman who was with\nArden later.",
    "I couldnt understand I still cant understand.",
    "What\nwoman How could a woman be in there talking to Arden after he was\ndead\n\nThere was no woman said Poirot.",
    "But M. Poirot Lynn croaked.",
    "That old lady.",
    "She saw her.",
    "She heard\nher.",
    "Aha said Poirot.",
    "But what did she see And what did she hear She\nsaw someone in trousers with a light tweed coat.",
    "She saw a head\ncompletely enveloped in an orange scarf arranged turbanwise and a\nface covered with makeup and a lipsticked mouth.",
    "She saw that in a\ndim light.",
    "And what did she hear She saw the hussy draw back into\n\n\fNo.",
    "5 and from within the room she heard a mans voice saying Get\nout of here my girl.",
    "Eh bien it was a man she saw and a man she\nheard But it was a very ingenious idea Mr Hunter Poirot added\nturning placidly to David.",
    "What do you mean David asked sharply.",
    "It is now to you that I will tell a story.",
    "You come along to the Stag at\nnine oclock or thereabouts.",
    "You come not to murder but to pay.",
    "What\ndo you find You find the man who had been blackmailing you lying on\nthe floor murdered in a particularly brutal manner.",
    "You can think fast\nMr Hunter and you realise at once that you are in imminent danger.",
    "You have not been seen entering the Stag by any one as far as you\nknow and your first idea is to clear out as soon as possible catch the\n9.20 train back to London and swear hard that you have not been near\nWarmsley Vale.",
    "To catch the train your only chance is to run across\ncountry.",
    "In doing so you run unexpectedly into Miss Marchmont and\nyou also realise that you cannot catch the train.",
    "You see the smoke of\nit in the valley.",
    "She too although you do not know it has seen the\nsmoke but she has not consciously realised that it indicates that you\ncannot catch the train and when you tell her that the time is ninefifteen she accepts your statement without any doubt.",
    "To impress on her mind that you do catch the train you invent a very\ningenious scheme.",
    "In fact you now have to plan an entirely new\nscheme to divert suspicion from yourself.",
    "You go back to Furrowbank letting yourself in quietly with your key\nand you help yourself to a scarf of your sisters you take one of her\n\n\flipsticks and you also proceed to make up your face in a highly\ntheatrical manner.",
    "You return to the Stag at a suitable time impress your personality on\nthe old lady who sits in the Residents Only room and whose\npeculiarities are common gossip at the Stag.",
    "Then you go up to No.",
    "5.",
    "When you hear her coming to bed you come out into the passage then\nwithdraw hurriedly inside again and proceed to say loudly Youd\nbetter get out of here my girl.",
    "Poirot paused.",
    "A very ingenious performance he observed.",
    "Is that true David cried Lynn.",
    "Is it true\n\nDavid was grinning broadly.",
    "I think a good deal of myself as a female impersonator.",
    "Lord you\nshould have seen that old gorgons face\n\nBut how could you be here at ten oclock and yet telephone to me\nfrom London at eleven demanded Lynn perplexedly.",
    "David Hunter bowed to Poirot.",
    "All explanations by Hercule Poirot he remarked.",
    "The man who\nknows everything.",
    "How did I do it\n\n\fVery simply said Poirot.",
    "You rang up your sister at the flat from the\npublic callbox and gave her certain precise instructions.",
    "At elevenfour exactly she put through a toll call to Warmsley Vale 34.",
    "When Miss\nMarchmont came to the phone the operator verified the number then\nsaying no doubt A call from London or Go ahead London something\nof that kind\n\nLynn nodded.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade then replaced the receiver.",
    "You Poirot turned to\nDavid carefully noting the time dialled 34 got it pressed Button A\nsaid London wants you in a slightly disguised voice and then spoke.",
    "The lapse of a minute or two would be nothing strange in a telephone\ncall these days and would only strike Miss Marchmont as a\nreconnection.",
    "Lynn said quietly\n\nSo thats why you rang me up David\n\nSomething in her tone quiet as it was made David look at her sharply.",
    "He turned to Poirot and made a gesture of surrender.",
    "No doubt about it.",
    "You do know everything To tell the truth I was\nscared stiff.",
    "I had to think up something.",
    "After Id rung Lynn I walked\nfive miles to Dasleby and went up to London by the early milk train.",
    "Slipped into the flat in time to rumple the bed and have breakfast with\nRosaleen.",
    "It never entered my head that the police would think shed\ndone it.",
    "And of course I hadnt the remotest idea who had killed him I simply\ncouldnt imagine who could have wanted to kill him.",
    "Absolutely nobody\nhad a motive as far as I could see except for myself and Rosaleen.",
    "That said Poirot has been the great difficulty.",
    "Motive.",
    "You and your\nsister had a motive for killing Arden.",
    "Every member of the Cloade\nfamily had a motive for killing Rosaleen.",
    "David said sharply\n\nShe was killed then It wasnt suicide\n\nNo.",
    "It was a carefullypremeditated wellthoughtout crime.",
    "Morphia\nwas substituted for bromide in one of her sleepingpowders  one\ntowards the bottom of the box.",
    "In the powders.",
    "David frowned.",
    "You dont mean  you cant mean\nLionel Cloade\n\nOh no said Poirot.",
    "You see practically any of the Cloades could\nhave substituted the morphia.",
    "Aunt Kathie could have tampered with\nthe powders before they left the surgery.",
    "Rowley here came up to\nFurrowbank with butter and eggs for Rosaleen.",
    "Mrs Marchmont came\nthere.",
    "So did Mrs Jeremy Cloade.",
    "Even Lynn Marchmont came.",
    "And\none and all they had a motive.",
    "Lynn didnt have a motive cried David.",
    "We all had motives said Lynn.",
    "Thats what you mean\n\n\fYes said Poirot.",
    "That is what has made the case difficult.",
    "David\nHunter and Rosaleen Cloade had a motive for killing Arden  but they\ndid not kill him.",
    "All of you Cloades had a motive for killing Rosaleen\nCloade and yet none of you killed her.",
    "This case is always has been\nthe wrong way round.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade was killed by the person who\nhad most to lose by her death.",
    "He turned his head slightly You killed\nher Mr Hunter\n\nI David cried.",
    "Why on earth should I kill my own sister\n\nYou killed her because she wasnt your sister.",
    "Rosaleen Cloade died\nby enemy action in London nearly two years ago.",
    "The woman you killed\nwas a young Irish housemaid Eileen Corrigan whose photograph I\nreceived from Ireland today.",
    "He drew it from his pocket as he spoke.",
    "With lightning swiftness David\nsnatched it from him leapt to the door jumped through it and banging\nit behind him was gone.",
    "With a roar of anger Rowley charged\nheadlong after him.",
    "Poirot and Lynn were left alone.",
    "Lynn cried out Its not true.",
    "It cant be true.",
    "Oh yes it is true.",
    "You saw half the truth once when you fancied David\nHunter was not her brother.",
    "Put it the other way and it all falls into\nshape.",
    "This Rosaleen was a Catholic Underhays wife was not a\nCatholic troubled by conscience wildly devoted to David.",
    "Imagine his\nfeelings on that night of the Blitz his sister dead Gordon Cloade dying\n\n\f all that new life of ease and money snatched away from him and then\nhe sees this girl very much the same age the only survivor except for\nhimself blasted and unconscious.",
    "Already no doubt he has made love\nto her and he has no doubt he can make her do what he wants.",
    "He had a way with women Poirot added dryly without looking at\nLynn who flushed.",
    "He is an opportunist he snatches his chance of fortune.",
    "He identifies\nher as his sister.",
    "She returns to consciousness to find him at her\nbedside.",
    "He persuades and cajoles her into accepting the role.",
    "But imagine their consternation when the first blackmailing letter\narrives.",
    "All along I have said to myself Is Hunter really the type of man\nto let himself be blackmailed so easily It seemed too that he was\nactually uncertain whether the man blackmailing him was Underhay or\nnot.",
    "But how could he be uncertain Rosaleen Cloade could tell him at\nonce if the man was her husband or not Why hurry her up to London\nbefore she has a chance to catch a glimpse of the man Because there could only be one reason  because he could not risk the man\ngetting a glimpse of her.",
    "If the man was Underhay he must not\ndiscover that Rosaleen Cloade was not Rosaleen Cloade at all.",
    "No\nthere was only one thing to be done.",
    "Pay up enough to keep the\nblackmailer quiet and then  do a flit  go off to America.",
    "And then unexpectedly the blackmailing stranger is murdered  and\nMajor Porter identifies him as Underhay.",
    "Never in his life has David\nHunter been in a tighter place Worse still the girl herself is beginning\nto crack.",
    "Her conscience is becoming increasingly active.",
    "She is\nshowing signs of mental breakdown.",
    "Sooner or later she will confess\n\n\fgive the whole thing away render him liable to criminal prosecution.",
    "Moreover he finds her demands on him increasingly irksome.",
    "He has\nfallen in love with you.",
    "So he decides to cut his losses.",
    "Eileen must die.",
    "He substitutes morphia for one of the powders prescribed for her by\nDr Cloade urges her on to take them every night suggests to her\nfears of the Cloade family.",
    "David Hunter will not be suspected since\nthe death of his sister means that her money passes back to the\nCloades.",
    "That was his trump card lack of motive.",
    "As I told you  this case was\nalways the wrong way round.",
    "The door opened and Superintendent Spence came in.",
    "Poirot said sharply Eh bien\n\nSpence said Its all right.",
    "Weve got him.",
    "Lynn said in a low voice\n\nDid he  say anything\n\nSaid hed had a good run for his money \n\nFunny added the Superintendent how they always talk at the\nwrong moment... We cautioned him of course.",
    "But he said Cut it out\nman.",
    "Im a gambler  but I know when Ive lost the last throw.",
    "Poirot murmured\n\n\fThere is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at its flood leads on\nto fortune...",
    "Yes the tide sweeps in  but it also ebbs  and may carry\nyou out to sea.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nIt was a Sunday morning when Rowley Cloade answering a knock at\nthe farm door found Lynn waiting outside.",
    "He stepped back a pace.",
    "Lynn\n\nCan I come in Rowley\n\nHe stood back a little.",
    "She passed him and went into the kitchen.",
    "She\nhad been at church and was wearing a hat.",
    "Slowly with an almost\nritual air she raised her hands took off the hat and laid it down on the\nwindowsill.",
    "Ive come home Rowley.",
    "What on earth do you mean\n\nJust that.",
    "Ive come home.",
    "This is home  here with you.",
    "Ive been a\nfool not to know it before  not to know journeys end when I saw it.",
    "Dont you understand Rowley Ive come home.",
    "You dont know what youre saying Lynn.",
    "I  I tried to kill you.",
    "I know.",
    "Lynn gave a grimace and put her fingers gingerly to her\nthroat.",
    "Actually it was just when I thought you had killed me that I\nbegan to realise what a really thundering fool Id been making of\nmyself\n\nI dont understand said Rowley.",
    "Oh dont be stupid.",
    "I always wanted to marry you didnt I And then I\ngot out of touch with you  you seemed to me so tame  so meek  I felt\nlife would be so safe with you  so dull.",
    "I fell for David because he was\ndangerous and attractive  and to be honest because he knows\nwomen much too well.",
    "But none of that was real.",
    "When you caught\nhold of me by the throat and said if I wasnt for you no one should have\nme  well  I knew then that I was your woman Unfortunately it seemed\nthat I was going to know it  just too late... Luckily Hercule Poirot\nwalked in and saved the situation.",
    "And I am your woman Rowley\n\nRowley shook his head.",
    "Its impossible Lynn.",
    "Ive killed two men  murdered them \n\nRubbish cried Lynn.",
    "Dont be pigheaded and melodramatic.",
    "If you\nhave a row with a hulking big man and hit him and he falls down and\nhits his head on a fender  that isnt murder.",
    "Its not even legally\nmurder.",
    "Its manslaughter.",
    "You go to prison for it.",
    "Possibly.",
    "If so I shall be on the step when you come out.",
    "And theres Porter.",
    "Im morally responsible for his death.",
    "No youre not.",
    "He was a fully adult responsible man  he could have\nturned down your proposition.",
    "One cant blame any one else for the\nthings one decides to do with ones eyes open.",
    "You suggested\ndishonesty to him he accepted it and then repented and took a quick\nway out.",
    "He was just a weak character.",
    "Rowley shook his head obstinately.",
    "Its no good old girl.",
    "You cant marry a gaolbird.",
    "I dont think youre going to gaol.",
    "A policeman would have been round\nfor you before now if so.",
    "Rowley stared.",
    "But damn it all manslaughter  bribing Porter \n\nWhat makes you think the police know anything about all that or ever\nwill.",
    "That fellow Poirot knows.",
    "He isnt the police.",
    "Ill tell you what the police think.",
    "They think David\nHunter killed Arden as well as Rosaleen now they know he was in\nWarmsley Vale that evening.",
    "They wont charge him with it because it\nisnt necessary  and besides I believe you cant be arrested twice on\nthe same charge.",
    "But as long as they think he did it they wont look for\nany one else.",
    "But that chap Poirot \n\nHe told the Superintendent it was an accident and I gather the\nSuperintendent just laughed at him.",
    "If you ask me I think Poirot will say\nnothing to any one.",
    "Hes rather a dear \n\nNo Lynn.",
    "I cant let you risk it.",
    "Apart from anything else I  well I\nmean can I trust myself What I mean is it wouldnt be safe for you.",
    "Perhaps not...",
    "But you see Rowley I do love you  and youve had\nsuch a hell of a time  and Ive never really cared very much for being\nsafe"
