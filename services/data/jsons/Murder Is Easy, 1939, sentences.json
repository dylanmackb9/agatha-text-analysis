    "MURDER IS EASY\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nEngland England after many years How was he going to like it Luke\nFitzwilliam asked himself that question as he walked down the\ngangplank to the dock.",
    "It was present at the back of his mind all\nthrough the wait in the customs shed.",
    "It came suddenly to the fore\nwhen he was finally seated in the boat train.",
    "Here he was honorably\nretired on a pension with some small private means of his own a\ngentleman of leisure come home to England.",
    "What was he going to do\nwith himself With an effort Luke Fitzwilliam averted his eyes from the\nlandscape outside the railwaycarriage window and settled down to a\nperusal of the papers he had just bought.",
    "The Times the Daily Clarion\nand Punch.",
    "He started with the Daily Clarion.",
    "The Clarion was given over entirely\nto Epsom.",
    "He had drawn a horse in the club sweep and he looked now to see\nwhat the Clarions racing correspondent thought of its chances.",
    "He\nfound it dismissed contemptuously in a sentence\n\nOf the others Jujube the II Marks Mile Santony and Jerry Boy are\nhardly likely to qualify for a place.",
    "A likely outsider is \n\nBut Luke paid no attention to the likely outsider.",
    "His eye had shifted to\nthe betting.",
    "Jujube the II was listed at a modest 40 to 1.",
    "He glanced at\nhis watch.",
    "A quarter to four.",
    "Well he thought its over now.",
    "And he wished hed had a bet on\nClarigold who was the second favorite.",
    "Then he opened the Times and became absorbed in more serious\nmatters.",
    "A full half hour afterward the train slowed down and finally\nstopped.",
    "Luke looked out of the window.",
    "They were in a large emptylooking station with many platforms.",
    "He\ncaught sight of a bookstall some way up the platform with a placard\nDERBY RESULT.",
    "Luke opened the door jumped out and ran toward\nthe bookstall.",
    "A moment later he was staring with a broad grin at a few\nsmudged lines in the stop press.",
    "DERBY RESULT\n\n1st  Jujube the II\n\n2nd  Mazeppa\n\n3rd  Clarigold\n\nLuke grinned broadly.",
    "A hundred pounds to blow Good old Jujube the\nII so scornfully dismissed by all the tipsters.",
    "He folded the paper still\ngrinning to himself and turned back  to face emptiness.",
    "In the\nexcitement of Jujube the IIs victory his train had slipped out of the\n\n\fstation unnoticed by him.",
    "When the devil did that train go out he\ndemanded of a gloomylooking porter.",
    "What train There hasnt been no train since the 314.",
    "There was a train here just now.",
    "I got out of it.",
    "The boat express.",
    "The boat express dont stop anywhere till London.",
    "But it did Luke assured him.",
    "I got out of it.",
    "Faced by facts the porter changed his ground.",
    "You didnt ought to\nhave done he said reproachfully.",
    "It dont stop here.",
    "But it did.",
    "That was signal that was.",
    "Signal against it.",
    "It didnt what youd call\nstop.",
    "You didnt ought to have got out.",
    "Well admit that said Luke.",
    "The wrong is done past all recall.",
    "What\nIm trying to get at is what do you a man experienced in the services\nof the railway company advise me to do\n\nReckon said the porter youd best go on by the 425.",
    "If the 425 goes to London said Luke the 425 is the train for me.",
    "Reassured on that point Luke strolled up and down the platform.",
    "A\nlarge board informed him that he was at FENNY CLAYTON JUNCTION\nFOR WYCHWOOD UNDER ASHE and presently a train consisting of\n\n\fone carriage pushed backward by an antiquated little engine came\nslowly puffing in and deposited itself in a modest way.",
    "At last with immense importance the London train came in.",
    "Luke\nscrutinized each compartment.",
    "The first a smoker contained a\ngentleman of military aspects smoking a cigar.",
    "He passed on to the\nnext one which contained a tiredlooking genteel young woman\npossibly a nursery governess and an activelooking small boy of about\nthree.",
    "Luke passed on quickly.",
    "The next door was open and the\ncarriage contained one passenger an elderly lady.",
    "She reminded Luke\nslightly of one of his aunts his Aunt Mildred who had courageously\nallowed him to keep a grass snake when he was ten years old.",
    "Aunt\nMildred had been decidedly a good aunt as aunts go.",
    "Luke entered the\ncarriage and sat down.",
    "After some five minutes of intense activity on the part of milk vans\nluggage trucks and other excitements the train moved slowly out of\nthe station.",
    "Luke unfolded his paper and turned to such items of news\nas might interest a man who had already read his morning paper.",
    "He\ndid not hope to read it for long.",
    "Being a man of many aunts he was\nfairly certain that the nice old lady in the corner did not propose to\ntravel in silence to London.",
    "He was right  a window that needed\nadjusting a dropped umbrella and the old lady was telling him what a\ngood train this was.",
    "Only an hour and ten minutes.",
    "Thats very good\nyou know very good indeed.",
    "Much better than the morning one.",
    "That\ntakes an hour and forty minutes.",
    "She went on Of course nearly\neveryone goes by the morning one.",
    "I mean when it is the cheap way its\nsilly to go up in the afternoon.",
    "I meant to go up this morning but Wonky\nPooh was missing  thats my cat a Persian such a beauty only hes\n\n\fhad a painful ear lately  and of course I couldnt leave home till he was\nfound\n\nLuke murmured Of course not and let his eyes drop ostentatiously\nto his paper.",
    "But it was of no avail.",
    "The flood went on\n\nSo I just made the best of a bad job and took the afternoon train\ninstead and of course its a blessing in one way because its not so\ncrowded  not that that matters when one is traveling first class.",
    "Of\ncourse I dont usually do that but really I was so upset because you\nsee Im going up on very important business and I wanted to think out\nexactly what I was going to say  just quietly you know.",
    "Luke\nrepressed a smile.",
    "So I thought just for once the expense was quite permissible.",
    "Of\ncourse she went on quickly with a swift glance at Lukes bronzed\nface I know soldiers on leave have to travel first class I mean being\nofficers its expected of them.",
    "Luke sustained the inquisitive glance of a pair of bright twinkling eyes.",
    "He capitulated at once.",
    "It would come to it he knew in the end.",
    "Im\nnot a soldier he said.",
    "Oh Im so sorry.",
    "I didnt mean  I just thought  you were so brown perhaps home from the East on leave.",
    "Im home from the East said Luke but not on leave.",
    "He stalled off\nfurther researches with a bald statement Im a policeman.",
    "In the police Now really thats very interesting.",
    "A dear friend of\nmine her boy has just joined the Palestinian police.",
    "Mayang Straits said Luke taking another short cut.",
    "Oh dear very interesting.",
    "Really its quite a coincidence  I mean\nthat you should be traveling in this carriage.",
    "Because you see this\nbusiness Im going up to town about  well actually it is to Scotland\nYard Im going.",
    "Really said Luke.",
    "The old lady continued happily Yes I meant to go up this morning\nand then as I told you I was so worried about Wonky Pooh.",
    "But you\ndont think it will be too late do you I mean there arent any special\noffice hours at Scotland Yard.",
    "I dont think they close down at four or anything like that said Luke.",
    "No of course they couldnt could they I mean somebody might\nwant to report a serious crime at any minute mightnt they\n\nExactly said Luke.",
    "For a moment the old lady relapsed into silence.",
    "She looked worried.",
    "I\nalways think its better to go to the fountainhead she said at last.",
    "John Reed is quite a nice fellow  thats our constable in Wychwood  a\nvery civilspoken pleasant man but I dont feel you know that he\nwould be quite the person to deal with anything serious.",
    "Hes quite\nused to dealing with people whove drunk too much or with exceeding\n\n\fthe speed limit or lightingup time or people who havent taken out a\ndog license and perhaps with burglary even.",
    "But I dont think  Im\nquite sure  he isnt the person to deal with murder\n\nLukes eyebrows rose.",
    "Murder\n\nThe old lady nodded vigorously.",
    "Yes murder.",
    "Youre surprised I can\nsee.",
    "I was myself at first.",
    "I really couldnt believe it.",
    "I thought I must\nbe imagining things.",
    "Are you quite sure you werent Luke asked gently.",
    "Oh no.",
    "She shook her head positively.",
    "I might have been the first\ntime but not the second or the third or the fourth.",
    "After that one\nknows.",
    "Luke said Do you mean there have been  er  several murders\n\nThe quiet gentle voice replied A good many Im afraid.",
    "She went\non Thats why I thought it would be best to go straight to Scotland\nYard and tell them about it.",
    "Dont you think thats the best thing to do\n\nLuke looked at her thoughtfully then he said Why yes I think youre\nquite right.",
    "He thought to himself Theyll know how to deal with her.",
    "Probably get\nhalf a dozen old ladies a week coming in burbling about the amount of\nmurders committed in their nice quiet country villages.",
    "There may be a\nspecial department for dealing with the old dears.",
    "He was roused from these meditations by the thin gentle voice\ncontinuing You know I remember reading once  I think it was the\nAbercrombie case.",
    "Of course hed poisoned quite a lot of people\nbefore any suspicion was aroused... What was I saying Oh yes\nsomebody said that there was a look  a special look that he gave\nanyone and then very shortly afterwards that person would be taken\nill.",
    "I didnt really believe that when I read about it but its true.",
    "Whats true\n\nThe look on a persons face.",
    "Luke stared at her.",
    "She was trembling a\nlittle and her nice pink cheeks had lost some of their color.",
    "I saw it first with Amy Gibbs  and she died.",
    "And then it was Carter.",
    "And Tommy Pierce.",
    "But now yesterday it was Doctor Humbleby  and\nhes such a good man  a really good man.",
    "Carter of course drank\nand Tommy Pierce was a dreadfully cheeky impertinent little boy and\nbullied the tiny boys twisting their arms and pinching them.",
    "I didnt\nfeel quite so badly about them but Doctor Humblebys different.",
    "He\nmust be saved.",
    "And the terrible thing is that if I went to him and told\nhim about it he wouldnt believe me Hed only laugh And John Reed\nwouldnt believe me either.",
    "But at Scotland Yard it will be different.",
    "Because naturally theyre used to crime there\n\nShe glanced out of the window.",
    "Oh dear we shall be in in a minute.",
    "She fussed a little opening and shutting her bag collecting her\numbrella.",
    "Its been such a relief talking to you.",
    "Most kind of you Im\nsure.",
    "So glad you think Im doing the right thing.",
    "Luke said kindly Im sure theyll give you good advice at Scotland\nYard.",
    "I really am most grateful.",
    "She fumbled in her bag.",
    "My card  oh dear\nI only have one.",
    "I must keep that for Scotland Yard.",
    "Of course of course.",
    "But my name is Fullerton.",
    "Miss Fullerton said Luke smiling.",
    "My name is Luke Fitzwilliam.",
    "As\nthe train drew into the platform he added Can I get you a taxi\n\nOh no thank you.",
    "Miss Fullerton seemed quite shocked at the idea.",
    "I shall take the tube.",
    "That will take me to Trafalgar Square and I shall\nwalk down Whitehall.",
    "Well good luck said Luke.",
    "Miss Fullerton shook him warmly by the hand.",
    "So kind she\nmurmured again.",
    "You know just at first I thought you didnt believe\nme.",
    "Luke had the grace to blush.",
    "Well he said.",
    "So many murders\nRather hard to do a lot of murders and get away with it eh\n\nMiss Fullerton shook her head.",
    "She said earnestly No no my dear\nboy thats where youre wrong.",
    "Its very easy to kill so long as no one\nsuspects you.",
    "And you see the person in question is just the last\nperson anyone would suspect.",
    "Well anyway good luck said Luke.",
    "Miss Fullerton was swallowed up in the crowd.",
    "He himself went off in\nsearch of his luggage thinking as he did so Just a little bit batty No\nI dont think so.",
    "A vivid imagination thats all.",
    "Hope they let her down\nlightly.",
    "Rather an old dear.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nJimmy Lorrimer was one of Lukes oldest friends.",
    "As a matter of\ncourse Luke stayed with Jimmy as soon as he got to London.",
    "It was\nwith Jimmy that he sailed forth on the evening of his arrival in search\nof amusement.",
    "It was Jimmys coffee that he drank with an aching head the morning\nafter and it was Jimmys voice that went unanswered while he read\ntwice over a small insignificant paragraph in the morning paper.",
    "Sorry Jimmy he said coming to himself with a start.",
    "What were you absorbed in  the political situation\n\nLuke grinned.",
    "No fear.",
    "No its rather queer.",
    "Old pussy I traveled up\nwith in the train yesterday got run over.",
    "Probably trusted to a Belisha Beacon said Jimmy.",
    "How do you\nknow its her\n\nOf course it maynt be.",
    "But its the same name  Fullerton.",
    "She was\nknocked down and killed by a car as she was crossing Whitehall.",
    "The\ncar didnt stop.",
    "Whoever was driving that car will pay for it.",
    "Bring in manslaughter as\nlikely as not.",
    "I tell you Im scared stiff of driving a car nowadays.",
    "What have you got at present in the way of a car\n\nFord V8.",
    "I tell you my boy \n\nThe conversation became severely mechanical.",
    "It was over a week later that Luke carelessly scanning the front page\nof the Times gave a sudden startled exclamation Well Im damned\n\nJimmy Lorrimer looked up.",
    "Whats the matter\n\nLuke raised his head and looked at his friend.",
    "His expression was so\npeculiar that Jimmy was quite taken aback.",
    "Whats up Luke You\nlook as though youd seen a ghost.",
    "For a minute or two the other did not reply.",
    "He dropped the paper\nstrode to the window and back again.",
    "Jimmy watched him with\nincreasing surprise.",
    "Luke dropped into a chair and leaned forward.",
    "Jimmy old son do you remember my mentioning an old lady I\ntraveled up to town with the day I arrived in England\n\nThe one you said reminded you of your Aunt Mildred And then she\ngot run over by a car\n\nThats the one.",
    "Listen Jimmy.",
    "The old girl came out with a long\nrigmarole of how she was going up to Scotland Yard to tell them about\na lot of murders.",
    "There was a murderer loose in her village thats what\nit amounted to and hed been doing some pretty rapid execution.",
    "You didnt tell me she was batty said Jimmy.",
    "I didnt think she was off her head.",
    "She was quite circumstantial\nmentioned one or two victims by name and then explained that what\nhad really rattled her was the fact that she knew who the next victim\nwas going to be.",
    "Yes said Jimmy encouragingly.",
    "The point is that the mans name was Humbleby  Doctor Humbleby.",
    "My old lady said Doctor Humbleby would be the next and she was\ndistressed because he was such a good man.",
    "Well said Jimmy.",
    "Well look at this.",
    "Luke passed over the paper his finger pressed\nagainst an entry in the column of deaths.",
    "Humbleby  On June 12 suddenly at his residence Sandgate\nWychwood under Ashe John Ward Humbleby M.D.",
    "beloved husband\nof Jessie Rose Humbleby.",
    "Funeral Friday.",
    "No flowers by request.",
    "You see.",
    "Jimmy Thats the name and the place and hes a doctor.",
    "What do you make of it\n\nJimmy took a moment or two to answer.",
    "His voice was serious when he said at last rather uncertainly I\nsuppose its just a damned odd coincidence.",
    "Luke wheeled round suddenly.",
    "Suppose that every word that dear\nbleating old sheep said was true Suppose that that fantastic story was\njust the plain literal truth\n\nOh come now old boy That would be a bit thick.",
    "Things like that\ndont happen.",
    "How do you know They may happen a good deal oftener than you\nsuppose.",
    "There speaks the police wallah Cant you forget youre a policeman\nnow that youve retired into private life\n\nOnce a policeman always a policeman I suppose said Luke.",
    "Now\nlook here Jimmy.",
    "The case stands like this.",
    "I was told a story  an\nimprobable but not an impossible story.",
    "One piece of evidence  the\ndeath of Doctor Humbleby  supports that story.",
    "And theres one other\nsignificant fact.",
    "Miss Fullerton was going to Scotland Yard with this\n\n\fimprobable story of hers.",
    "But she didnt get there.",
    "She was run over\nand killed by a car that didnt stop.",
    "Jimmy objected You dont know that she didnt get there.",
    "She might\nhave been killed after her visit not before.",
    "She might have been yes but I dont think she was.",
    "Thats pure supposition.",
    "It boils down to this You believe in this  this\nmelodrama.",
    "Luke shook his head sharply.",
    "No.",
    "I dont say that.",
    "All I say is theres a\ncase for investigation.",
    "In other words you are going to Scotland Yard\n\nNo it hasnt come to that yet  not nearly.",
    "As you say this man\nHumblebys death may be merely a coincidence.",
    "Then what may I ask is the idea\n\nThe idea is to go down to this place and look into the matter.",
    "So thats the idea is it\n\nDont you agree that that is the only sensible way to set about it\n\nJimmy stared at him then he said Are you serious about this\nbusiness Luke\n\n\fAbsolutely.",
    "Suppose the whole things a mares nest\n\nThat would be the best thing that could happen.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "Jimmy frowned.",
    "But you dont think it is do you\n\nMy dear fellow Im keeping an open mind.",
    "Jimmy was silent for a minute or two.",
    "Then he said Got any plan I mean youll have to have some reason\nfor suddenly arriving in this place.",
    "Yes I suppose I shall.",
    "No suppose about it.",
    "Do you realize what a small English country\ntown is like Anyone new sticks out a mile\n\nI shall have to adopt a disguise said Luke with a sudden grin.",
    "What\ndo you suggest Artist Hardly I cant draw let alone paint.",
    "Jimmy said Wait a sec.",
    "Give me that paper again.",
    "Taking it he gave\nit a cursory glance and announced triumphantly I thought so Luke\nold boy to put it in a nutshell Ill fix you O.K.",
    "Everythings as easy as\nwinking.",
    "Luke wheeled round.",
    "What\n\n\fJimmy was continuing with modest pride I thought something struck\na chord Wychwood under Ashe.",
    "Of course The very place\n\nHave you by any chance a pal who knows the coroner there\n\nNot this time.",
    "Better than that my boy.",
    "Nature as you know has\nendowed me plentifully with aunts and cousins my father having been\none of a family of thirteen.",
    "Now listen to this I have a cousin in\nWychwood under Ashe.",
    "Jimmy youre a blinking marvel.",
    "It is pretty good isnt it said Jimmy modestly.",
    "Tell me about him.",
    "Its a her.",
    "Her names Bridget Conway.",
    "For the last two years shes\nbeen secretary to Lord Easterfield.",
    "The man who owns those nasty little weekly papers\n\nThats right.",
    "Rather a nasty little man too.",
    "Pompous He was born in\nWychwood under Ashe and being the kind of snob who rams his birth\nand breeding down your throat and glories in being selfmade he has\nreturned to his home village bought up the only big house in the\nneighborhood  it belonged to Bridgets family originally by the way and is busy making the place into a model estate.",
    "And your cousin is his secretary\n\n\fShe was said Jimmy darkly.",
    "Now shes gone one better Shes\nengaged to him\n\nOh said Luke rather taken aback.",
    "Hes a catch of course said Jimmy.",
    "Rolling in money.",
    "Bridget took\nrather a toss over some fellow.",
    "It pretty well knocked the romance out\nof her.",
    "I dare say this will pan out very well.",
    "Shell probably be kind but\nfirm with him and hell eat out of her hand.",
    "And where do I come in\n\nJimmy replied promptly You go down there to stay.",
    "Youd better be\nanother cousin.",
    "Bridgets got so many that one more or less wont\nmatter.",
    "Ill fix that up with her all right.",
    "She and I have always been\npals.",
    "Now for your reason for going there  witchcraft my boy.",
    "Witchcraft\n\nFolklore local superstitions  all that sort of thing.",
    "Wychwood under\nAshe has got rather a reputation that way.",
    "One of the last places\nwhere they had a witches Sabbath witches were still burnt there in\nthe last century all sorts of traditions.",
    "Youre writing a book see\nCorrelating the customs of the Mayang Straits and old English folklore\n points of resemblance and so on.",
    "You know the sort of stuff.",
    "Go\nround with a notebook and interview the oldest inhabitant about local\nsuperstitions and customs.",
    "Theyre quite used to that sort of thing\ndown there and if youre staying at Ashe Manor it vouches for you.",
    "What about Lord Easterfield\n\n\fHell be all right.",
    "Hes quite uneducated and completely credulous actually believes things he reads in his own papers.",
    "Anyway Bridget\nwill fix him.",
    "Bridgets all right.",
    "Ill answer for her.",
    "Luke drew a deep breath.",
    "Jimmy old scout it looks as though the\nthing was going to be easy.",
    "Youre a wonder.",
    "If you can really fix me up\nwith your cousin \n\nThat will be absolutely O.K.",
    "Leave it to me.",
    "Im no end grateful to you.",
    "Jimmy said All I ask is if youre hunting down a homicidal murderer\nlet me be in at the death.",
    "He added sharply What is it\n\nLuke said slowly Just something I remembered my old lady saying to\nme.",
    "Id said to her that it was a bit thick to do a lot of murders and get\naway with it and she answered that I was wrong  that it was very easy\nto kill.",
    "He stopped and then said slowly I wonder if thats true.",
    "Jimmy I wonder if it is \n\nWhat\n\n easy to kill.",
    "Chapter 3\n\n\fThe June sun was shining when Luke came over the hill and down into\nthe little country town of Wychwood under Ashe.",
    "It lay innocently and\npeacefully in the sunlight mainly composed of a long straggling street\nthat ran along under the overhanging brow of Ashe Ridge.",
    "It seemed\nsingularly remote strangely untouched.",
    "Luke thought Im probably\nmad.",
    "The whole things fantastic.",
    "He drove gently down the twisting road and so entered the main\nstreet.",
    "Wychwood as has been said consisted mainly of its one\nprincipal street.",
    "There were shops small Georgian houses prim and\naristocratic with whitened steps and polished knockers there were\npicturesque cottages with flower gardens.",
    "There was an inn the Bells\nand Motley standing a little back from the street.",
    "There was a village\ngreen and a duck pond and presiding over them a dignified Georgian\nhouse which Luke thought at first must be his destination Ashe Manor.",
    "But on coming nearer he saw that there was a large painted board\nannouncing that it was the Museum and Library.",
    "Farther on there was\nan anachronism a large white modern building austere and irrelevant\nto the cheerful haphazardness of the rest of the place.",
    "It was Luke\ngathered a local Institute and Lads Club.",
    "It was at this point that he\nstopped and asked the way to his destination.",
    "He was told that Ashe Manor was about half a mile farther on he would\nsee the gates on his right.",
    "Luke continued his course.",
    "He found the\ngates easily they were of new and elaborate wrought iron.",
    "He drove\nin caught a gleam of red brick through the trees and turned a corner\nof the drive to be stupefied by the appalling and incongruous\ncastellated mass that greeted his eyes.",
    "While he was contemplating the nightmare the sun went in.",
    "He\nbecame suddenly conscious of the overlying menace of Ashe Ridge.",
    "There was a sudden sharp gust of wind blowing back the leaves of the\ntrees and at that moment a girl came round the corner of the\ncastellated mansion.",
    "Her black hair was blown up off her head by the\nsudden gust and Luke was reminded of a picture he had once seen Nevinsons Witch.",
    "The long pale delicate face the black hair flying up to the stars.",
    "He\ncould see this girl on a broomstick flying up to the moon.",
    "She came\nstraight toward him.",
    "You must be Luke Fitzwilliam.",
    "Im Bridget Conway.",
    "He took the hand she held out.",
    "He could see her now as she was  not\nin a sudden moment of fantasy.",
    "Tall slender a long delicate face with\nslightly hollow cheekbones ironic black brows black eyes and hair.",
    "She was like a delicate etching he thought  poignant and beautiful.",
    "He\nsaid How dyou do I must apologize for wishing myself on you like\nthis.",
    "Jimmy would have it that you wouldnt mind.",
    "Oh we dont.",
    "Were delighted.",
    "She smiled a sudden curving smile\nthat brought the corners of her mouth halfway up her cheeks.",
    "Jimmy\nand I always stand in together.",
    "And if youre writing a book on folklore\nthis is a splendid place.",
    "All sorts of legends and picturesque spots.",
    "Splendid said Luke.",
    "They went together toward the house.",
    "Luke stole another glance at it.",
    "He discerned now traces of a sober\nQueen\n\nAnne\n\ndwelling\n\noverlaid\n\nand\n\nsmothered\n\nby\n\nthe\n\nflorid\n\nmagnificence.",
    "He remembered that Jimmy had mentioned the house\nas having originally belonged to Bridgets family.",
    "That he thought\ngrimly was in its unadorned days.",
    "Inside Bridget Conway led the way\nto a room with book shelves and comfortable chairs where a tea table\nstood near the window with two people sitting by it.",
    "She said Gordon this is Luke a sort of cousin of mine.",
    "Lord Easterfield was a small man with a semibald head.",
    "His face was\nround and ingenuous with a pouting mouth and boiled gooseberry\neyes.",
    "He was dressed in carelesslooking country clothes.",
    "They were\nunkind to his figure which ran mostly to stomach.",
    "He greeted Luke with affability Glad to see you  very glad.",
    "Just come\nback from the East I hear.",
    "Interesting place.",
    "Writing a book so\nBridget tells me.",
    "They say too many books are written nowadays.",
    "I say\nno always room for a good one.",
    "Bridget said My aunt Mrs. Anstruther and Luke shook hands with a\nmiddleaged woman with a rather foolish mouth.",
    "Mrs. Anstruther as Luke soon learned was devoted body and soul to\ngardening.",
    "After acknowledging the introduction she said now I believe those\nnew rock roses would do perfectly in this climate and proceeded to\nimmerse herself in catalogues.",
    "Throwing his squat little figure back in his chair.",
    "Lord Easterfield\nsipped his tea and studied Luke appraisingly.",
    "So you write books he murmured.",
    "Feeling slightly nervous Luke was about to enter on explanations\nwhen he perceived that Lord Easterfield was not really seeking for\ninformation.",
    "Ive often thought said His Lordship complacently that\nId like to write a book myself.",
    "Trouble is I havent got the time.",
    "Im a\nvery busy man.",
    "Of course.",
    "You must be.",
    "You wouldnt believe what Ive got on my shoulders said Lord\nEasterfield.",
    "I take a personal interest in each one of my publications.",
    "I\nconsider that Im responsible for molding the public mind.",
    "Next week\nmillions of people will be thinking and feeling just exactly what Ive\nintended to make them feel and think.",
    "Thats a very solemn thought.",
    "That means responsibility.",
    "Well I dont mind responsibility.",
    "Im not\nafraid of it.",
    "I can do with responsibility.",
    "Lord Easterfield swelled out his chest attempted to draw in his\nstomach and glared amiably at Luke.",
    "Bridget Comway said lightly\nYoure a great man Gordon.",
    "Have some more tea.",
    "Lord Easterfield replied simply I am a great man.",
    "No I wont have any\nmore tea.",
    "Then descending from his own Olympian heights to the level of more\nordinary mortals he inquired kindly of his guest Know anybody\nround this part of the world\n\nLuke shook his head.",
    "Then on an impulse and feeling that the sooner\nhe began to get down to his job the better he added\n\nAt least theres a man here that I promised to look up  friend of mine.",
    "Man called Humbleby.",
    "Hes a doctor.",
    "Oh Lord Easterfield struggled upright in his chair.",
    "Doctor\nHumbleby Pity.",
    "Whats a pity\n\nDied about a week ago said Lord Easterfield.",
    "Oh dear said Luke.",
    "Im sorry about that.",
    "Dont think youd have cared for him said Lord Easterfield.",
    "Opinionated pestilential muddleheaded old fool.",
    "Which means put in Bridget that he disagreed with Gordon.",
    "Question of our water supply said Lord Easterfield.",
    "I may tell you\nMr. Fitzwilliam that Im a publicspirited man.",
    "Ive got the welfare of\nthis town at heart.",
    "I was born here.",
    "Yes born in this very town.",
    "Exhaustive details of Lord Easterfields career were produced for\nLukes benefit and the former wound up triumphantly Do you know\n\n\fwhat stands where my fathers shop used to be A fine building built\nand endowed by me  Institute Boys Club everything tiptop and up to\ndate.",
    "Employed the best architect in the country I must say hes made\na bare plain job of it  looks like a workhouse or a prison to me  but\nthey say its all right so I suppose it must be.",
    "Cheer up said Bridget.",
    "You had your own way over this house.",
    "Lord Easterfield chuckled appreciatively.",
    "Yes they tried to put it over on me here When one architect wouldnt\ndo what I wanted I sacked him and got another.",
    "The fellow I got in the\nend understood my ideas pretty well.",
    "He pandered to your worst flights of imagination said Bridget.",
    "Shed have liked the place left as it was said Lord Easterfield.",
    "He\npatted her arm.",
    "No use living in the past my dear.",
    "I always had a\nfancy for a castle and now Ive got one\n\nWell said Luke a little at a loss for words its a great thing to know\nwhat you want.",
    "And I usually get it too said the other chuckling.",
    "You nearly didnt get your way about the water scheme Bridget\nreminded him.",
    "Oh that said Lord Easterfield.",
    "Humbleby was a fool.",
    "These elderly\nmen are inclined to be pigheaded.",
    "They wont listen to reason.",
    "Doctor Humbleby was rather an outspoken man wasnt he Luke\nventured.",
    "He made a good many enemies that way I should imagine.",
    "Nno I dont know that I should say that demurred Lord Easterfield\nrubbing his nose.",
    "Eh Bridget\n\nHe was very popular with everyone I always thought said Bridget.",
    "I\nonly saw him when he came about my ankle that time but I thought he\nwas a dear.",
    "Yes he was popular enough on the whole admitted Lord\nEasterfield.",
    "Though I know one or two people who had it in for him.",
    "Lots of little feuds and cliques in a place like this he said.",
    "Yes I suppose so said Luke.",
    "He hesitated uncertain of his next\nstep.",
    "What sort of people live here mostly he queried.",
    "It was rather a weak question but he got an instant response.",
    "Relicts\nmostly said Bridget.",
    "Clergymens daughters and sisters and wives.",
    "Doctors dittos.",
    "About six women to every man.",
    "But there are some men hazarded Luke.",
    "Oh yes theres Mr. Abbot the solicitor and young Doctor Thomas\nDoctor Humblebys partner and Mr. Wake the rector and  Who else\nis there Gordon Oh Mr. Ellsworthy who keeps the antique shop.",
    "And\nMajor Horton and his bulldogs.",
    "Theres somebody else I believe my friends mentioned as living down\nhere said Luke.",
    "They said she was a nice old pussy but talked a lot.",
    "What was the name now Ive got it.",
    "Fullerton.",
    "Lord Easterfield said with a hoarse chuckle Really youve no luck\nShes dead too.",
    "Got run over the other day in London.",
    "Killed outright.",
    "You seem to have a lot of deaths here said Luke lightly.",
    "Lord Easterfield bridled immediately.",
    "Not at all.",
    "One of the healthiest places in England.",
    "Cant count\naccidents.",
    "They may happen to anyone.",
    "But Bridget Conway said thoughtfully As a matter of fact Gordon\nthere have been a lot of deaths in the last year.",
    "Theyre always having\nfunerals.",
    "Nonsense my dear.",
    "Luke said Was Doctor Humblebys death an accident too\n\nLord Easterfield shook his head.",
    "Oh no he said.",
    "Humbleby died of acute septicemia.",
    "Just like a\ndoctor.",
    "Scratched his finger with a rusty nail or something paid no\nattention to it and it turned septic.",
    "He was dead in three days.",
    "Doctors are rather like that said Bridget.",
    "And of course theyre\nvery liable to infection I suppose if they dont take care.",
    "It was sad\nthough.",
    "His wife was brokenhearted.",
    "No good of rebelling against the will of Providence said Lord\nEasterfield easily.",
    "But was it the will of Providence Luke asked himself later as he\nchanged into his dinner jacket.",
    "Septicemia Perhaps.",
    "A very sudden\ndeath though.",
    "And there echoed through his head Bridget Conways\nlight spoken words  there have been a lot of deaths in the last year.",
    "Chapter 4\n\nLuke had thought out his plan of campaign with some care and\nprepared to put it into action without more ado when he came down to\nbreakfast the following morning.",
    "The gardening aunt was not in\nevidence but Lord Easterfield was eating kidneys and drinking coffee\nand Bridget Conway had finished her meal and was standing at the\nwindow looking out.",
    "After goodmornings had been exchanged and\nLuke had sat down with a plentifully heaped plate of eggs and bacon\nhe began.",
    "I must get to work he said.",
    "Difficult thing is to induce people to talk.",
    "You know what I mean not people like you and  er  Bridget.",
    "He\nremembered just in time not to say Miss Conway.",
    "Youd tell me\nanything you knew.",
    "But the trouble is you wouldnt know the things I\n\n\fwant to know  that is the local superstitions.",
    "Youd hardly believe the\namount of superstition that still lingers in outoftheway parts of the\nworld.",
    "Why theres a village in Devonshire.",
    "The rector had to remove\nsome old granite menhirs that stood by the church because the\npeople persisted in marching round them in some old ritual every time\nthere was a death.",
    "Extraordinary how old heathen rites persist.",
    "Here followed almost verbatim a page of a work that Luke had read up\nfor the occasion.",
    "Deaths are the most hopeful line he ended.",
    "Burial rites and\ncustoms always survive longer than any others.",
    "Besides for some\nreason or other village people always like talking about deaths.",
    "They enjoy funerals agreed Bridget from the window.",
    "I thought Id make that my starting point went on Luke.",
    "If I can get a\nlist of recent demises in the parish track down the relatives and get\ninto conversation Ive no doubt I shall soon get a hint of what Im after.",
    "Who had I better get the data from  the parson\n\nMr. Wake would probably be very interested said Bridget.",
    "Hes\nquite an old dear and a bit of an antiquary.",
    "He could give you a lot of\nstuff I expect.",
    "Luke had a momentary qualm during which he hoped that the\nclergyman might not be so efficient an antiquary as to expose his own\npretensions.",
    "Aloud he said heartily Good.",
    "Youve no idea I suppose\nof likely people whove died during the last year.",
    "Bridget murmured Let me see.",
    "Carter of course.",
    "He was the\nlandlord of the Seven Stars that nasty little pub down by the river.",
    "A drunken ruffian said Lord Easterfield.",
    "One of these socialistic\nabusive brutes.",
    "A good riddance.",
    "And Mrs. Rose the laundress went on Bridget.",
    "And little Tommy\nPierce he was a nasty little boy if you like.",
    "Oh of course and that girl\nAmy WhatsHerName Her voice changed slightly as she uttered the\nlast name.",
    "Amy said Luke.",
    "Amy Gibbs.",
    "She was housemaid here and then she went to Miss\nWaynflete.",
    "There was an inquest on her.",
    "Why\n\nFool of a girl mixed up some bottles in the dark said Lord\nEasterfield.",
    "She took what she thought was cough mixture and it was hat paint\nexplained Bridget.",
    "Luke raised his eyebrows.",
    "Somewhat of a tragedy.",
    "Bridget said There was some idea of her having done it on purpose.",
    "Some row with a young man.",
    "She spoke slowly almost reluctantly.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Luke felt instinctively the presence of some\nunspoken feeling weighing down the atmosphere.",
    "He thought Amy Gibbs Yes that was one of the names old Miss\nFullerton mentioned.",
    "She had also mentioned a small boy  Tommy\nsomeone  of whom she had evidently held a low opinion  this it\nseemed was shared by Bridget.",
    "And yes he was almost sure the\nname Carter had been spoken too.",
    "Rising he said lightly Talking like\nthis makes me feel rather ghoulish  as though I dabbled only in\ngraveyards.",
    "Marriage customs are interesting too but rather more\ndifficult to introduce into conversation unconcernedly.",
    "I should imagine that was likely said Bridget with a faint twitch of\nthe lips.",
    "Illwishing or overlooking  theres another interesting subject went\non Luke with a wouldbe show of enthusiasm.",
    "You often get that in\nthese Old World places.",
    "Know of any gossip of that kind here\n\nLord Easterfield slowly shook his head.",
    "Bridget Conway said We shouldnt be likely to hear of things like\nthat.",
    "Luke took it up almost before she finished talking No doubt about it\nIve got to search in lower social spheres to get what I want.",
    "Ill be off\nto the vicarage first and see what I can get there.",
    "After there perhaps\na walk to the  Seven Stars did you say And what about the small boy\nof unpleasant habits Did he leave any sorrowing relatives\n\n\fMrs. Pierce keeps a tobacco and paper shop in High Street.",
    "That said Luke is nothing less than providential.",
    "Well Ill be on my\nway.",
    "With a swift graceful movement Bridget moved from the window.",
    "I\nthink she said Ill come with you if you dont mind.",
    "Of course not.",
    "He said it as heartily as possible but he wondered if\nshe had noticed that just for a moment he had been taken aback.",
    "It\nwould have been easier for him to tackle an elderly antiquarian\nclergyman without an alert discerning intelligence by his side.",
    "Oh\nwell he thought to himself.",
    "Its up to me to do my stuff convincingly.",
    "Bridget said Will you just wait Luke whilst I change my shoes\n\nWhat else could she have called him Since she had agreed to Jimmys\nscheme of cousinship she could hardly call him Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "He\nthought suddenly and uneasily What does she think of it all What\ndoes she think He had thought of her  if he had thought of her at all as a little blond secretary person astute enough to have captured a\nrich mans fancy.",
    "Instead she had force brains a cool clear\nintelligence and he had no idea what she was thinking of him.",
    "He thought Shes not an easy person to deceive.",
    "Im ready now She had joined him so silently that he had not heard\nher approach.",
    "She wore no hat and there was no net on her hair.",
    "As they stepped out\nfrom the house the wind sweeping round the corner of the castellated\nmonstrosity caught her long black hair and whipped it into a sudden\nfrenzy round her face.",
    "Looking back at the battlements behind him he said irritably What an\nabomination Couldnt anyone stop him\n\nBridget answered An Englishmans house is his castle  literally so in\nGordons case He adores it.",
    "Conscious that the remark was in bad taste he said\n\nIts your old home isnt it Do you adore to see it the way it is now\n\nShe looked at him then  a steady slightly amused look it was.",
    "I hate\nto destroy the dramatic picture you are building up she murmured.",
    "But actually I left here when I was two and a half so you see the oldhome motive doesnt apply.",
    "I cant even remember this place.",
    "Youre right said Luke.",
    "Forgive the lapse into film language.",
    "She laughed Truth she said is seldom romantic.",
    "And there was a\nsudden bitter scorn in her voice that startled him.",
    "He flushed a deep\nred under his tan then realized suddenly that the bitterness had not\nbeen aimed at him.",
    "It was her own scorn and her own bitterness.",
    "Luke\nwas wisely silent.",
    "But he wondered a good deal about Bridget Conway.",
    "Five minutes brought them to the church and to the vicarage that\nadjoined it.",
    "They found the vicar in his study.",
    "Alfred Wake was a small\n\n\fstooping old man with very mild blue eyes and an absentminded but\ncourteous air.",
    "He seemed pleased but a little surprised by the visit.",
    "Mr. Fitzwilliam is staying with us at Ashe Manor said Bridget and\nhe wants to consult you about a book he is writing.",
    "Mr. Wake turned his mild inquiring eyes toward the younger man and\nLuke plunged into explanations.",
    "He was nervous  doubly so.",
    "Nervous\nin the first place because this man had no doubt a far deeper\nknowledge of folklore and superstitious rites and customs than one\ncould acquire by merely hurriedly cramming from a haphazard\ncollection of books.",
    "Secondly he was nervous because Bridget\nConway was standing by listening.",
    "Luke was relieved to find that Mr. Wakes special interest was Roman\nremains.",
    "He confessed gently that he knew very little of medieval\nfolklore and witchcraft.",
    "He mentioned the existence of certain items in\nthe history of Wychwood offered to take Luke to the particular ledge\nof hill where it was said the witches Sabbaths had been held but\nexpressed himself regretful that he could add no special information of\nhis own.",
    "Inwardly much relieved Luke expressed himself as somewhat\ndisappointed and then plunged into inquiries as to deathbed\nsuperstitions.",
    "Mr. Wake shook his head gently.",
    "I am afraid I should be the last\nperson to know about those.",
    "My parishioners would be careful to keep\nanything unorthodox from my ears.",
    "Thats so of course.",
    "But Ive no doubt all the same there is a lot of superstition still rife.",
    "These village communities are very backward.",
    "Luke plunged boldly.",
    "Ive been asking Miss Conway for a list of all the\nrecent deaths she could remember.",
    "I thought I might get at something\nthat way.",
    "I suppose you could supply me with a list so that I could pick\nout the likelies.",
    "Yes yes that could be managed.",
    "Giles our sexton a good fellow but\nsadly deaf could help you there.",
    "Let me see now.",
    "There have been a\ngood many  a good many  a treacherous spring and a hard winter\nbehind it  and then a good many accidents.",
    "Quite a cycle of bad luck\nthere seems to have been.",
    "Sometimes said Luke a cycle of bad luck is attributed to the\npresence of a particular person.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "The old story of Jonah.",
    "But I do not think there have been\nany strangers here  nobody that is to say outstanding in any way and Ive certainly never heard any rumor of such a feeling but then\nagain as I said perhaps I shouldnt.",
    "Now let me see.",
    "Quite recently\nwe have had Doctor Humbleby and poor Lavinia Fullerton.",
    "A fine man.",
    "Doctor Humbleby.",
    "Bridget put in Mr. Fitzwilliam knows friends of his.",
    "Do you indeed Very sad.",
    "His loss will be much felt.",
    "A man with many\nfriends.",
    "But surely a man with some enemies too said Luke.",
    "Im only going\nby what Ive heard my friends say he went on hastily.",
    "Mr. Wake sighed.",
    "A man who spoke his mind and a man who wasnt\nalways very tactful shall we say He shook his head.",
    "It does get\npeoples backs up.",
    "But he was greatly beloved among the poorer\nclass.",
    "Luke said carelessly You know I always feel that one of the most\nunpalatable facts to be faced in life is the fact that every death that\noccurs means a gain to someone  I dont mean only financially.",
    "The vicar nodded thoughtfully.",
    "I see your meaning yes.",
    "We read in an\nobituary notice that a man is regretted by everybody but that can only\nbe true very rarely I fear.",
    "In Doctor Humblebys case there is no\ndenying that his partner.",
    "Doctor Thomas will find his position very\nmuch improved by Doctor Humblebys death.",
    "How is that\n\nThomas I believe is a very capable fellow  certainly Humbleby\nalways said so  but he didnt get on here very well.",
    "He was I think\novershadowed by Humbleby who was a man of very definite\nmagnetism.",
    "Thomas appeared rather colorless in contrast.",
    "He didnt\nimpress his patients at all.",
    "I think he worried over it too and that made\nhim worse  more nervous and tonguetied.",
    "As a matter of fact Ive\nnoticed an astonishing difference already.",
    "More aplomb more\npersonality.",
    "I think he feels a new confidence in himself.",
    "He and\nHumbleby didnt always agree I believe.",
    "Thomas was all for newer\n\n\fmethods of treatment and Humbleby preferred to stick to the old ways.",
    "There were clashes between them more than once  over that as well\nas over a matter nearer home.",
    "But there I mustnt gossip.",
    "Bridget said softly and clearly But I think Mr. Fitzwilliam would like\nyou to gossip.",
    "Luke shot her a quick disturbed look.",
    "Mr. Wake shook his head doubtfully and then went on smiling a little\nin deprecation\n\nI am afraid one learns to take too much interest in ones neighbors\naffairs.",
    "Rose Humbleby is a very pretty girl.",
    "One doesnt wonder that\nGeoffrey Thomas lost his heart.",
    "And of course Humblebys point of\nview was quite understandable too  the girl is young and buried away\nhere she hadnt much chance of seeing other men.",
    "He objected said Luke.",
    "Very definitely.",
    "Said they were far too young.",
    "And of course young\npeople resent being told that.",
    "There was a very definite coldness\nbetween the two men.",
    "But I must say that Im sure Doctor Thomas was\ndeeply distressed at his partners unexpected death.",
    "Septicemia Lord Easterfield told me.",
    "Yes just a little scratch that got infected.",
    "Doctors run grave risks in\nthe course of their profession Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "They do indeed said Luke.",
    "Mr. Wake gave a sudden start.",
    "But I have wandered a long way from\nwhat we were talking about he said.",
    "A gossiping old man I am\nafraid.",
    "We were speaking of the survival of pagan death customs and\nof recent deaths.",
    "There was Lavinia Fullerton  one of our most kindly\nchurch helpers.",
    "Then there was that poor girl Amy Gibbs you might\ndiscover something in your line there Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "There was just a\nsuspicion you know that it might have been suicide and there are\ncertain rather eerie rites in connection with that type of death.",
    "There is\nan aunt  not I fear a very estimable woman and not very much\nattached to her niece but a great talker.",
    "Valuable said Luke.",
    "Then there was Tommy Pierce he was in the choir at one time  a\nbeautiful treble  quite angelic but not a very angelic boy otherwise I\nam afraid.",
    "We had to get rid of him in the end he made the other boys\nbehave badly too.",
    "Poor lad Im afraid he was not very much liked\nanywhere.",
    "He was dismissed from the post office where we got him a\njob as telegraph boy.",
    "He was in Mr. Abbots office for a while but there\nagain he was dismissed very soon  interfered with some confidential\npapers I believe.",
    "Then of course he was at Ashe Manor for a time wasnt he.",
    "Miss Conway  as a garden boy and Lord Easterfield had\nto discharge him for gross impertinence.",
    "I was so sorry for his mother\n a very decent hardworking soul.",
    "Miss Waynflete very kindly got him\nsome odd windowcleaning work.",
    "Lord Easterfield objected at first\nthen suddenly he gave in actually it was sad that he did so.",
    "Why\n\n\fBecause the boy was killed that way.",
    "He was cleaning the top\nwindows of the library  the old hall you know  and tried some silly\nfooling  dancing on the window ledge or something of that sort  lost\nhis balance or else became dizzy and fell.",
    "A nasty business He never\nrecovered consciousness and died a few hours after they got him to\nthe hospital.",
    "Did anyone else see him fall asked Luke with interest.",
    "No.",
    "He was on the garden side not the front of the house.",
    "They\nestimate he lay there for about half an hour before anyone found him.",
    "Who did find him\n\nMiss Fullerton.",
    "You remember the lady I mentioned just now who was\nunfortunately killed in a street accident the other day.",
    "Poor soul she\nwas terribly upset.",
    "A nasty experience She had obtained permission\nto take a cutting of some plants and found the boy there lying where\nhe had fallen.",
    "It must have been a very unpleasant shock said Luke thoughtfully.",
    "A greater shock he thought to himself than you know.",
    "He was a disgusting bully said Bridget.",
    "You know he was Mr.\nWake.",
    "Always tormenting cats and stray puppies and pinching other\nlittle boys.",
    "I know  I know.",
    "Mr. Wake shook his head sadly.",
    "But you know my\ndear Miss Conway sometimes cruelty is not so much innate as due to\n\n\fthe fact that imagination is slow in ripening.",
    "That is why if you\nconceive of a grown man with the mentality of a child you realize that\nthe cunning and brutality of a lunatic may be quite unrealized by the\nman himself.",
    "A lack of growth somewhere that I am convinced is at\nthe root of much of the cruelty and stupid brutality in the world today.",
    "One must put away childish things  He shook his head and spread out\nhis hands.",
    "Bridget said in a voice suddenly hoarse Yes youre right.",
    "I know\nwhat you mean.",
    "A man who is a child is the most frightening thing in\nthe world.",
    "Luke Fitzwilliam wondered very much who the person Bridget was\nthinking of might be.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nMr. Wake murmured a few more names to himself.",
    "Let me see now.",
    "Poor Mrs. Rose and old Bell and that child of the\nElkins and Harry Carter.",
    "Theyre not all my people you understand.",
    "Mrs. Rose and Carter were dissenters.",
    "And that cold spell in March\ntook off poor old Ben Stanbury at last  ninetytwo he was.",
    "Amy Gibbs died in April said Bridget.",
    "Yes poor girl a sad mistake\nto happen.",
    "Luke looked up to find Bridget watching him.",
    "She lowered her eyes\nquickly.",
    "He thought with some annoyance Theres something here\nthat I havent got on to.",
    "Something to do with this girl Amy Gibbs.",
    "When they had taken leave of the vicar and were outside again he\nsaid Just who and what was Amy Gibbs\n\nBridget took a minute or two to answer.",
    "Then she said  and Luke noticed the slight constraint in her voice Amy was one of the most inefficient housemaids I have ever known.",
    "Thats why she got the sack\n\nNo.",
    "She stayed out after hours playing about with some young man.",
    "Gordon has very moral and oldfashioned views.",
    "Sin in his view does\nnot take place until after eleven oclock but then it is rampant.",
    "So he\ngave the girl notice and she was impertinent about it\n\nLuke asked Shes the one who swallowed off hat paint in mistake for\ncough mixture\n\nYes.",
    "Rather a stupid thing to do Luke hazarded.",
    "Very stupid.",
    "Was she stupid\n\n\fNo she was quite a sharp girl.",
    "Luke stole a look at her.",
    "He was puzzled.",
    "Her replies were given in an\neven tone without emphasis or even much interest.",
    "But behind what\nshe said there was he felt convinced something not put into words.",
    "At that moment Bridget stopped to speak to a tall man who swept off\nhis hat and greeted her with breezy heartiness.",
    "Bridget after a word\nor two introduced Luke This is my cousin Mr. Fitzwilliam who is\nstaying at the Manor.",
    "Hes down here to write a book.",
    "This is Mr.\nAbbot.",
    "Luke looked at Mr. Abbot with some interest.",
    "This was the solicitor\nwho had employed Tommy Pierce.",
    "Mr. Abbot was not at all the\nconventional type of lawyer he was neither thin spare nor tightlipped.",
    "He was a big florid man dressed in tweeds with a hearty\nmanner and a jovial effusiveness.",
    "There were little creases at the\ncorners of his eyes and the eyes themselves were more shrewd than\none appreciated in a first casual glance.",
    "Writing a book eh Novel\n\nFolklore said Bridget.",
    "Youve come to the right place for that said the lawyer.",
    "Wonderfully\ninteresting part of the world here.",
    "So Ive been led to understand said Luke.",
    "I dare say you could help\nme a bit.",
    "You must come across curious old deeds or know of some\ninteresting surviving customs.",
    "Well I dont know about that.",
    "Maybe  maybe.",
    "No haunted houses\n\nNo I dont know of anything of that kind.",
    "Theres the child superstition of course said Luke.",
    "Death of a boy\nchild  a violent death that is  the boy always walks.",
    "Not a girl child interesting that.",
    "Very said Mr. Abbot.",
    "I never heard that before.",
    "Since Luke had just invented it that was hardly surprising.",
    "Seems\ntheres a boy here  Tommy something  was in your office at one time.",
    "Ive reason to believe they think that hes walking.",
    "Mr. Abbots red face turned slightly purple.",
    "Tommy Pierce A goodfornothing prying meddlesome jackanapes.",
    "Whos seen him Whats this story\n\nThese things are difficult to pin down said Luke.",
    "People wont come\nout into the open with a statement.",
    "Its just in the air so to speak.",
    "Yes yes I suppose so.",
    "Luke changed the subject adroitly The real person to get hold of is\nthe local doctor.",
    "They hear a lot in the poorer cases they attend.",
    "All\nsorts of superstitions and charms  probably love philters and all the\nrest of it.",
    "You must get on to Thomas.",
    "Good fellow Thomas thoroughly uptodate man.",
    "Not like poor old Humbleby.",
    "Bit of a reactionary wasnt he\n\nAbsolutely pigheaded a diehard of the worst description.",
    "You had a real row over the water scheme didnt you asked\nBridget.",
    "Again a rich ruddy glow suffused Abbots face.",
    "Humbleby stood dead\nin the way of progress he said sharply.",
    "He held out against the\nscheme He was pretty rude too in what he said.",
    "Didnt mince his\nwords.",
    "Some of the things he said to me were positively actionable.",
    "Bridget murmured But lawyers never go to law do they They know\nbetter.",
    "Abbot laughed immoderately.",
    "His anger subsided as quickly as it had\nrisen.",
    "Pretty good Miss Bridget And youre not far wrong.",
    "We who\nare in it know too much about the law haha.",
    "Well I must be getting\nalong.",
    "Give me a call if you think I can help you in any way Mr.  er \n\nFitzwilliam said Luke.",
    "Thanks I will.",
    "As they walked on Bridget said If you want to hear more about Amy\nGibbs I can take you to someone who could help you.",
    "Who is that\n\n\fA Miss Waynflete.",
    "Amy went there after she left the Manor.",
    "She was\nthere when she died.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "He was a little taken aback.",
    "Well thank you very much.",
    "She lives just here.",
    "They were crossing the village green.",
    "Inclining her head in the\ndirection of the big Georgian house that Luke had noticed the day\nbefore Bridget said Thats Wych Hall.",
    "Its a library now.",
    "Adjoining the Hall was a little house that looked rather like a dolls\nhouse in proportion.",
    "Its steps were dazzlingly white its knocker shone\nand its window curtains showed white and prim.",
    "Bridget pushed open\nthe gate and advanced to the steps.",
    "As she did so the front door\nopened and an elderly woman came out.",
    "She was Luke thought\ncompletely the country spinster.",
    "Her thin form was neatly dressed in a\ntweed coat and skirt and she wore a gray silk blouse with a cairngorm\nbrooch.",
    "Her hat a conscientious felt sat squarely upon her wellshaped head.",
    "Her face was pleasant and her eyes through their pincenez decidedly intelligent.",
    "Good\n\nmorning.",
    "Miss\n\nWaynflete\n\nsaid\n\nBridget.",
    "This\n\nis\n\nMr.\n\nFitzwilliam.",
    "Luke bowed.",
    "Hes writing a book  about deaths and\nvillage customs and general gruesomeness.",
    "Oh dear said Miss Waynflete.",
    "How very interesting.",
    "And she\nbeamed encouragingly upon him.",
    "He was reminded of Miss Fullerton.",
    "I thought said Bridget  and again he noted that curious flat tone in\nher voice  that you might tell him something about Amy.",
    "Oh said Miss Waynflete.",
    "About Amy Yes.",
    "About Amy Gibbs.",
    "He was conscious of a new factor in her expression.",
    "She seemed to be\nthoughtfully summing him up.",
    "Then as though coming to a decision\nshe drew back into the hall.",
    "Do come in she said.",
    "I can go out later.",
    "No no  in answer to a\nprotest from Luke  I had really nothing important to do.",
    "Just a little\nunimportant shopping.",
    "The small drawing room was exquisitely neat and smelled faintly of\nburnt lavender.",
    "Miss Waynflete offered her guests chairs and then\nsaid apologetically Im afraid I dont smoke myself so I have no\ncigarettes but do please smoke if you like.",
    "Luke refused but Bridget promptly lighted a cigarette.",
    "Sitting bolt upright in a chair with carved arms.",
    "Miss Waynflete studied\nher guest for a moment or two and then dropping her eyes as though\nsatisfied she said You want to know about that poor girl Amy The\nwhole thing was very sad and caused me a great deal of distress.",
    "Such\na tragic mistake.",
    "Wasnt there some question of  suicide asked Luke.",
    "Miss Waynflete shook her head.",
    "No no that I cannot believe for a\nmoment.",
    "Amy was not at all that type.",
    "What type was she asked Luke bluntly.",
    "Id like to hear your\naccount of her.",
    "Miss Waynflete said Well of course she wasnt at all a good servant.",
    "But nowadays really one is thankful to get anybody.",
    "She was very\nslipshod over her work and always wanting to go out.",
    "Well of course\nshe was young and girls are like that nowadays.",
    "They dont seem to\nrealize that their time is their employers.",
    "Luke looked properly sympathetic and Miss Waynflete proceeded to\ndevelop her theme.",
    "She was fond of admiration went on Miss\nWaynflete and was inclined to think a lot of herself.",
    "Mr. Ellsworthy he keeps the new antique shop but he is actually a gentleman  he\ndabbles a little in water colors and he had done one or two sketches of\nthe girls head  and I think you know that that rather gave her ideas.",
    "She was rather inclined to quarrel with the young man she was\nengaged to  Jim Harvey.",
    "Hes a mechanic at the garage and very fond\nof her.",
    "Miss Waynflete paused and then went on I shall never forget that\ndreadful night.",
    "Amy had been out of sorts a nasty cough and one thing\nand another  those silly cheap silk stockings they will wear and\nshoes with paper soles practically of course they catch chills  and\nshed been to the doctor that afternoon.",
    "Luke asked quickly Doctor Humbleby or Doctor Thomas\n\n\fDoctor Thomas.",
    "And he gave her a bottle of cough mixture that she\nbrought back with her.",
    "Something quite harmless  a stock mixture I\nbelieve.",
    "She went to bed early and it must have been about one in the\nmorning when the noise began  an awful kind of choking scream.",
    "I got\nup and went to her door but it was locked on the inside.",
    "I called to her\nbut couldnt get any answer.",
    "Cook was with me and we were both\nterribly upset.",
    "And then we went to the front door and luckily there\nwas Reed  our constable  just passing on his beat and we called to\nhim.",
    "He went round the back of the house and managed to climb up on\nthe outhouse roof and as her window was open he got in quite easily\nthat way and unlocked the door.",
    "Poor girl it was terrible.",
    "They couldnt\ndo anything for her and she died in hospital a few hours later.",
    "And it was  what  hat paint\n\nYes.",
    "Oxalicacid poisoning is what they called it.",
    "The bottle was about\nthe same size as the coughunctus one.",
    "The latter was on her\nwashstand and the hat paint was by her bed.",
    "She must have picked up\nthe wrong bottle and put it by her in the dark ready to take if she felt\nbadly.",
    "That was the theory at the inquest.",
    "Miss Waynflete stopped.",
    "Her intelligent goats eyes looked at him and\nhe was aware that some particular significance lay behind them.",
    "He\nhad the feeling that she was leaving some part of the story untold and\na stronger feeling that for some reason she wanted him to be aware\nof the fact.",
    "There was a silence  a long and rather difficult silence.",
    "Luke felt like\nan actor who does not know his cue.",
    "He said rather weakly And you\ndont think it was suicide\n\n\fMiss Waynflete said promptly Certainly not.",
    "If the girl had decided to\nmake away with herself she would have bought something probably.",
    "This was an old bottle of stuff that she must have had for years.",
    "And\nanyway as Ive told you she wasnt that kind of girl.",
    "So you think  what said Luke bluntly.",
    "Miss Waynflete said I think it was very unfortunate.",
    "She closed her\nlips and looked at him earnestly.",
    "Just when Luke was feeling that he must try desperately to say\nsomething anticipated a diversion occurred.",
    "There was a scratching\nat the door and a plaintive mew.",
    "Miss Waynflete sprang up and went to\nopen the door whereupon a magnificent orange Persian walked in.",
    "He\npaused looked disapprovingly at the visitor and sprang up on the arm\nof Miss Waynfletes chair.",
    "Miss Waynflete addressed him in a cooing\nvoice.",
    "Why Wonky Pooh Wheres my Wonky Pooh been all the morning\n\nThe name struck a chord of memory.",
    "Where had he heard something about a Persian cat called Wonky\nPooh He said Thats a very handsome cat.",
    "Have you had him long\n\nMiss Waynflete shook her head.",
    "Oh no he belonged to an old friend\nof mine.",
    "Miss Fullerton.",
    "She was run over by one of these horrid\nmotorcars and of course I couldnt have let Wonky Pooh go to\n\n\fstrangers.",
    "Lavinia would have been most upset.",
    "She simply\nworshipped him  and he is very beautiful isnt he\n\nLuke admired the cat gravely.",
    "Miss Waynflete said Be careful of his\nears.",
    "Theyve been rather painful lately.",
    "Luke stroked the animal warily.",
    "Bridget rose to her feet.",
    "She said We\nmust be going.",
    "Miss Waynflete shook hands with Luke.",
    "Perhaps she said I shall see you again before long.",
    "Luke said cheerfully I hope so Im sure.",
    "He thought she looked puzzled and a little disappointed.",
    "Her gaze\nshifted to Bridget  a rapid look with a hint of interrogation in it.",
    "Luke\nfelt that there was some understanding between the two women from\nwhich he was excluded.",
    "It annoyed him but he promised himself to get\nto the bottom of it before long.",
    "Miss Waynflete came out with them.",
    "Luke stood a minute on the top of the steps looking with approval on\nthe untouched primness of the village green and the duck pond.",
    "Marvelously unspoilt this place he said.",
    "Miss Waynfletes face lit up.",
    "Yes indeed she said eagerly.",
    "Really it\nis still just as I remember it as a child.",
    "We lived in the Hall you know.",
    "But when it came to my brother he did not care to live in it  indeed\ncould not afford to do so  and it was put up for sale.",
    "A builder had\nmade an offer and was I believe going to develop the land  I think\nthat was the phrase.",
    "Fortunately Lord Easterfield stepped in and\n\n\facquired the property and saved it.",
    "He turned the house into a library\nand museum really it is practically untouched.",
    "I act as librarian twice\na week there  unpaid of course  and I cant tell you what a pleasure it\nis to be in the old place and know that it will not be vandalized.",
    "And\nreally it is a perfect setting you must visit our little museum one day\nMr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "There are some quite interesting local exhibits.",
    "I certainly shall make a point of doing so Miss Waynflete.",
    "Lord Easterfield has been a great benefactor to Wychwood said\nMiss Waynflete.",
    "It grieves me that there are people who are sadly\nungrateful.",
    "Her lips pressed themselves together.",
    "Luke discreetly asked no\nquestions.",
    "He said goodbye again.",
    "When they were outside the gate Bridget said Do you want to pursue\nfurther researches or shall we go home by way of the river Its a\npleasant walk.",
    "Luke answered promptly.",
    "He had no mind for further investigations\nwith Bridget Conway standing by listening.",
    "He said Go around by the\nriver by all means.",
    "They walked along the High Street.",
    "One of the last houses had a sign\ndecorated in old gold lettering with the word ANTIQUES on it.",
    "Luke\npaused and peered through one of the windows into the cool depths.",
    "Rather a nice slipware dish there he remarked.",
    "Do for an aunt of\nmine.",
    "Wonder how much they want for it\n\n\fShall we go in and see\n\nDo you mind I like pottering about antique shops.",
    "Sometimes one\npicks up a good bargain.",
    "I doubt if you will here said Bridget dryly.",
    "Ellsworthy knows the\nvalue of his stuff pretty accurately I should say.",
    "The door was open.",
    "In the hall were chairs and settees and dressers\nwith china and pewter in them.",
    "Two rooms full of goods opened at\neither side.",
    "Luke went into the room on the left and picked up the\nslipware dish.",
    "At the same moment a dim figure came forward from the\nback of the room where he had been sitting at a Queen Anne walnut\ndesk.",
    "Ah dear Miss Conway what a pleasure to see you.",
    "Good morning Mr. Ellsworthy.",
    "Mr. Ellsworthy was a thin young man dressed in russet brown.",
    "He had\na long pale face and long black hair.",
    "Luke was introduced and Mr.\nEllsworthy immediately transferred his attention to him.",
    "Genuine old English slipware.",
    "Lovely isnt it I have some good\npieces but I hate to sell them.",
    "Its always been my dream to live in the\ncountry and have a little shop.",
    "Marvelous place Wychwood it has\natmosphere if you know what I mean.",
    "The artistic temperament murmured Bridget.",
    "Ellsworthy turned on her with a flash of long white hands.",
    "Not that\nterrible phrase Miss Conway.",
    "Im a tradesman thats all just a\ntradesman.",
    "But youre really an artist arent you said Luke.",
    "I mean you do\nwater colors dont you Miss Waynflete told us that you had made\nseveral sketches of a girl  Amy Gibbs.",
    "Oh Amy said Mr. Ellsworthy.",
    "He took a step backward and set a\nbeer mug rocking.",
    "He steadied it carefully.",
    "He said Did I Oh yes I\nsuppose I did.",
    "His poise seemed somewhat shaken.",
    "She was a pretty girl said Bridget.",
    "Ellsworthy had recovered his aplomb.",
    "Do you think so he asked.",
    "Very interesting thought...",
    "If youre\ninterested in slipware he went on to Luke I have a couple slipware\nbirds.",
    "Luke displayed a faint interest in the birds and then asked the price of\na duck.",
    "Ellsworth named a figure.",
    "Thanks said Luke.",
    "But I dont think Ill deprive you of it after all.",
    "I am always relieved you know said Ellsworthy when I dont make\na sale.",
    "Foolish isnt it Look here Ill let you have the stuff for a guinea\nless  you care for it I can see that it makes all the difference.",
    "And\nafter all this is a shop.",
    "No thanks said Luke.",
    "Mr. Ellsworthy accompanied them out to the door.",
    "Queer fellow Ellsworthy he remarked when they were out of\nearshot.",
    "I believe he dabbles in black magic.",
    "Not Black Masses but that sort of\nthings.",
    "The reputation of this place helps.",
    "Luke said rather awkwardly Good Lord I think hes the kind of chap I\nneed.",
    "I really ought to have talked to him on the subject.",
    "Do you think so said Bridget.",
    "He knows a lot about it.",
    "Luke said Ill have to look him up some other day.",
    "Bridget didnt answer.",
    "They were out of the town now.",
    "She turned\naside to follow a footpath and they came to the river.",
    "There they\npassed a small man with a stiff mustache and protuberant eyes.",
    "He\nhad three bulldogs with him to whom he was shouting hoarsely in turn\nNero come here Nellie leave it I tell you Augustus Augustus I say\n\n\nHe broke off to raise his hat stared at Luke with what was evidently a\ndevouring\n\ncuriosity\n\nand\n\npassed\n\non\n\nexpostulations.",
    "Major Horton and his bulldogs asked Luke.",
    "resuming\n\nhis\n\nhoarse\n\n\fQuite right.",
    "Havent we seen practically everyone of note in Wychwood this\nmorning\n\nPractically.",
    "I feel rather intrusive said Luke.",
    "I suppose a stranger in an English\nvillage is bound to stick out a mile he added ruefully remembering\nJimmy Lorrimers remarks.",
    "Major Horton never hides his curiosity very well said Bridget.",
    "He\ndid stare rather.",
    "Hes the sort of man you could tell was a major anywhere said Luke\nrather viciously.",
    "Bridget said abruptly Shall we sit on the bank a bit Weve got lots of\ntime.",
    "They sat on a fallen tree that made a convenient seat.",
    "Bridget went on\nYes Major Horton is very military has an orderlyroom manner.",
    "Youd\nhardly believe he was the most henpecked man in existence a year\nago.",
    "What that fellow\n\nYes.",
    "He had the most disagreeable woman for a wife that Ive ever\nknown.",
    "She had the money too and never scrupled to underline the\nfact in public.",
    "Poor brute  Horton I mean.",
    "He behaved very nicely to her  always the officer and gentleman.",
    "Personally I wonder he didnt take a hatchet to her.",
    "She wasnt popular I gather.",
    "Everybody disliked her.",
    "She snubbed Gordon and patronized me and\nmade herself generally unpleasant wherever she went.",
    "But I gather a merciful Providence removed her\n\nYes about a year ago.",
    "Acute gastritis.",
    "She gave her husband.",
    "Doctor\nThomas and two nurses absolute hell but she died all right.",
    "The\nbulldogs brightened up at once.",
    "Intelligent brutes.",
    "There was a silence.",
    "Bridget was idly picking at the long grass.",
    "Luke\nfrowned at the opposite bank unseeingly.",
    "Once again the dreamlike\nquality of his mission obsessed him.",
    "How much was fact how much\nimagination Wasnt it bad for one to go about studying every fresh\nperson you met as a potential murderer Something degrading about\nthat point of view.",
    "Damn it all thought Luke.",
    "Ive been a policeman\ntoo long.",
    "He was brought out of his abstraction with a shock.",
    "Bridgets cold\nclear voice was speaking.",
    "Mr. Fitzwilliam she said just exactly why have you come down\nhere\n\nChapter 6\n\nLuke had been just in the act of applying a match to a cigarette.",
    "The\nunexpectedness of her remark momentarily paralyzed his hand.",
    "He\nremained quite motionless for a second or two the match burned\ndown and scorched his finger.",
    "Damn said Luke as he dropped the match and shook his hand\nvigorously.",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "You gave me rather a nasty jolt.",
    "He\nsmiled ruefully.",
    "Did I\n\nYes.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Oh well I suppose anyone of real intelligence was\nbound to see through me.",
    "That story of my writing a book on folklore\ndidnt take you in for a moment I suppose\n\nNot after Id once seen you.",
    "Not sufficient brains to write a book Dont spare my feelings.",
    "Id\nrather know.",
    "You might write a book but not that kind of book  old superstitions\ndelving into the past  not that sort of thing Youre not the kind of man\n\n\fto whom the past means much  perhaps not even the future  only just\nthe present.",
    "Hm.",
    "I see.",
    "He made a wry face.",
    "Damn it all youve made me\nnervous ever since I got here You looked so confoundedly intelligent.",
    "Im sorry said Bridget dryly.",
    "What did you expect\n\nWell I really hadnt thought about it.",
    "But she went on calmly A fluffy little person with just enough brains\nto realize her opportunities and marry her boss\n\nLuke made a confused noise.",
    "She turned a cool amused glance on\nhim.",
    "I quite understand.",
    "Its all right.",
    "Im not annoyed.",
    "Luke chose effrontery.",
    "Well perhaps it was something faintly\napproaching that.",
    "But I didnt think much about it.",
    "She said slowly No you wouldnt.",
    "You dont cross your fences till you\nget to them.",
    "She paused a minute then said Why are you down\nhere Mr. Fitzwilliam\n\nThey had returned full circle to the original question.",
    "Luke had been\naware that it must be so.",
    "In the last few seconds he had been trying to\nmake up his mind He looked up now and met her eyes  shrewd\ninquiring eyes that met his with a calm steady gaze.",
    "There was a\ngravity in them which he had not quite expected to find there.",
    "It would be better I think he said meditatively not to tell you any\nmore lies.",
    "Much better.",
    "But the truths awkward.",
    "Look here have you yourself formed any\nopinions I mean has anything occurred to you about my being here\n\nShe nodded slowly and thoughtfully.",
    "What was your idea Will you tell me I fancy it may help somehow.",
    "Bridget said quietly I had an idea that you came down here in\nconnection with the death of that girl Amy Gibbs.",
    "Thats it then Thats what I saw  what I felt  whenever her name\ncropped up I knew there was something.",
    "So you thought I came down\nabout that\n\nDidnt you\n\nIn a way yes.",
    "He was silent frowning.",
    "The girl beside him sat equally silent not\nmoving.",
    "She said nothing to disturb his train of thought.",
    "He made up\nhis mind.",
    "Ive come down here on a wildgoose chase  on a\nfantastical and probably quite absurd and melodramatic supposition.",
    "Amy Gibbs is part of that whole business.",
    "Im interested to find out\nexactly how she died.",
    "Yes I thought so.",
    "But dash it all why did you think so What is there about her death\nthat  well aroused your interest\n\nBridget said Ive thought all along that there was something wrong\nabout it.",
    "Thats why I took you to see Miss Waynflete.",
    "Why\n\nBecause she thinks so too.",
    "Oh.",
    "Luke thought back rapidly.",
    "He understood now the underlying\nsuggestions of that intelligent spinsters manner.",
    "She thinks as you do\n that theres something odd about it Bridget nodded.",
    "Why\nexactly\n\nHat paint to begin with.",
    "What do you mean  hat paint\n\nWell about twenty years ago people did paint hats  one season you\nhad a pink straw next season a bottle of hat paint and it became dark\nblue then perhaps another bottle and a black hat But not nowadays.",
    "Hats are cheap  tawdry stuff to be thrown away when out of fashion.",
    "Even girls of the class of Amy Gibbs\n\nId be more likely to paint a hat than she would.",
    "Thrifts gone out.",
    "And\ntheres another thing.",
    "It was red hat paint.",
    "Well\n\nAnd Amy Gibbs had red hair  carrots\n\nYou mean it doesnt go together\n\nBridget nodded.",
    "You wouldnt wear a scarlet hat with carroty hair.",
    "Its\nthe sort of thing a man wouldnt realize but \n\nLuke interrupted her with heavy significance.",
    "No a man wouldnt realize that.",
    "It fits in  it all fits in.",
    "Bridget said Jimmy has got some odd friends at Scotland Yard.",
    "Youre not \n\nLuke said quickly Im not an official detective and Im not a well\nknown private investigator with rooms in Baker Street and so on.",
    "Im\nexactly what Jimmy told you I was  a retired policeman from the East.",
    "Im homing in on this business because of an odd thing that happened\nin the train to London.",
    "He gave a brief synopsis of his conversation with Miss Fullerton and\nthe subsequent events that had brought about his presence in\nWychwood.",
    "So you see he ended its fantastic Im looking for a certain man  a\nsecret killer  a man here in Wychwood probably well known and\n\n\frespected.",
    "If Miss Fullertons right and youre right and Miss WhatsErName is right that man killed Amy Gibbs.",
    "Bridget said I see.",
    "It could have been done from outside I suppose\n\nYes I think so said Bridget slowly.",
    "Reed the constable climbed up\nto her window by means of an outhouse.",
    "The window was open.",
    "It was\na bit of a scramble but a reasonably active man would find no real\ndifficulty.",
    "And having done that he did what\n\nSubstituted a bottle of hat paint for the cough unctus.",
    "Hoping shed do exactly what she did do  wake up drink it off and\nthat everyone would say shed made a mistake or committed suicide\n\nYes.",
    "There was no suspicion of what they call in books foul play at the\ninquest\n\nNo.",
    "Men again I suppose.",
    "The hatpaint point wasnt raised\n\nNo.",
    "But it occurred to you\n\nYes.",
    "And to Miss Waynflete Have you discussed it together\n\nBridget smiled faintly.",
    "Oh no not in the sense you mean.",
    "I mean we\nhavent said anything right out.",
    "I dont really know how far the old\npussy has gone in her own mind.",
    "Id say shed been just worried to\nstart with and gradually getting more so.",
    "Shes quite intelligent you\nknow went to Girton or wanted to and was advanced when she was\nyoung.",
    "Shes not got quite the woolly mind of most of the people down\nhere.",
    "Miss Fullerton had rather a woolly mind I should imagine said Luke.",
    "Thats why I never dreamed there was anything in her story to begin\nwith.",
    "She was pretty shrewd I always thought said Bridget.",
    "Most of\nthese rambling old dears are as sharp as nails in some ways.",
    "You said\nshe mentioned other names\n\nLuke nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "A small boy  that was Tommy Pierce.",
    "I\nremembered the name as soon as I heard it.",
    "And Im pretty sure that\nthe man Carter came in too.",
    "Carter Tommy Pierce Amy Gibbs Doctor Humbleby said Bridget\nthoughtfully.",
    "As you say its almost too fantastic to be true.",
    "Who on\nearth would want to kill those people They were all so different\n\n\fLuke asked Any idea as to why anyone should want to do away with\nAmy Gibbs\n\nBridget shook her head.",
    "I cant imagine.",
    "What about the man Carter How did he die by the way\n\nFell into the river and was drowned.",
    "He was on his way home it was a\nmisty night and he was quite drunk.",
    "Theres a footbridge with a rail on\nonly one side.",
    "It was taken for granted that he missed his footing.",
    "But someone could quite easily have given him a shove\n\nOh yes.",
    "And somebody else could quite easily have given nasty little Tommy a\npush when he was windowcleaning\n\nAgain yes.",
    "So it boils down to the fact that its really quite easy to remove three\nhuman beings without anyone suspecting.",
    "Miss Fullerton suspected Bridget pointed out.",
    "Luke said I suppose its no good my asking you if youve a hunch of\nany kind Theres no particular individual in Wychwood who gives you\na creepy feeling down the spine or who has strange pale eyes or a\nqueer maniacal giggle\n\n\fBridget said You think this man is definitely mad\n\nOh I should say so.",
    "A lunatic all right but a cunning one.",
    "My Miss\nFullerton spoke of the look in his eyes when he was measuring up his\nnext victim.",
    "From the way she spoke I got the impression  its only an\nimpression mark you  that the man she was speaking of was at least\nher social equal.",
    "Of course I may be wrong\n\nYoure probably quite right Those nuances of conversation cant be\nput down in black and white but theyre the sort of things one doesnt\nreally make mistakes about.",
    "You know said Luke its a great relief to have you knowing all\nabout it.",
    "It will probably cramp your style less I agree.",
    "And I can probably help\nyou.",
    "Your help will be invaluable.",
    "You really mean to see it through\n\nOf course.",
    "Luke said with a sudden slight embarrassment What about Lord\nEasterfield Do you think \n\nNaturally we wont tell Gordon anything about it said Bridget.",
    "You mean he wouldnt believe it\n\n\fOh hed believe it Gordon could believe anything Hed probably be\nsimply thrilled and insist on having half a dozen of his bright young\nmen down to beat up the neighborhood Hed simply adore it\n\nThat does rather rule it out agreed Luke.",
    "Yes we cant allow him to have his simple pleasures Im afraid.",
    "Luke looked at her.",
    "He seemed about to say something then changed\nhis mind.",
    "He looked instead at his watch.",
    "Yes said Bridget we ought to be getting home.",
    "She got up.",
    "There\nwas a sudden constraint between them as though Lukes unspoken\nwords hovered uncomfortably in the air.",
    "They walked home in silence.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nLuke sat in his bedroom.",
    "At lunchtime he had sustained an\ninterrogation by Mrs. Anstruther as to what flowers hed had in his\ngarden in the Mayang Straits.",
    "He had then been told what flowers\nwould have done well there.",
    "He had also listened to further Talks to\nYoung Men on the Subject of Myself by Lord Easterfield.",
    "Now he was\nmercifully alone.",
    "He took a sheet of paper and wrote down a series of names.",

    "Mr. Abbot.",
    "Possible case against him\n\nI feel a lawyer is definitely a suspicious person.",

    "He\nmurmured softly ... which is absurd How nicely Euclid put things.",
    "He tore up the lists and burnt them.",
    "He said to himself This job isnt\ngoing to be exactly easy.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nDoctor Thomas leaned back in his chair and passed a long delicate\nhand over his thick fair hair.",
    "He was a young man whose appearance\nwas deceptive.",
    "Immature as he might look though the diagnosis he\nhad just pronounced on Lukes rheumatic knee agreed almost\nprecisely with that delivered by an eminent Harley Street specialist\nonly a week earlier.",
    "Thanks said Luke.",
    "Well Im relieved you think that electrical\ntreatment will do the trick.",
    "I dont want to turn into a cripple at my\nage.",
    "Doctor Thomas smiled boyishly.",
    "Oh I dont think theres any danger\nof that Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "Well youve relieved my mind said Luke.",
    "I was thinking of going to\nsome specialist chap but Im sure theres no need now.",
    "Doctor Thomas smiled again.",
    "Go if it makes your mind easier.",
    "After\nall its always a good thing to have an experts opinion.",
    "Luke said quickly Men get the wind up pretty badly in these ways.",
    "I\nexpect you find that I often think a doctor must feel himself a\nmedicine man  a kind of magician to most of his patients.",
    "The element of faith enters in very largely.",
    "I know.",
    "The doctor says so is a remark always uttered with\nsomething like reverence.",
    "Doctor Thomas raised his shoulders.",
    "If ones patients only knew he\nmurmured humorously.",
    "Then he said Youre writing a book on magic arent you Mr.\nFitzwilliam\n\nNow how did you know that exclaimed Luke perhaps with\nsomewhat overdone surprise.",
    "Doctor Thomas looked amused.",
    "Oh my dear sir news gets about very\nrapidly in a place like this.",
    "We have so little to talk about.",
    "It probably gets exaggerated too.",
    "Youll be hearing Im raising the\nlocal spirits and emulating the witch of Endor.",
    "Rather odd you should say that.",
    "Why\n\nWell the rumor has been going round that you had raised the ghost of\nTommy Pierce.",
    "Pierce Pierce Is that the small boy who fell out of a window\n\nYes.",
    "Now I wonder how  Of course.",
    "I made some remark to the solicitor whats his name  Abbot.",
    "Yes the story originated with Abbot.",
    "Dont say Ive converted a hardheaded solicitor to a belief in\nghosts\n\nYou believe in ghosts yourself then\n\nYour tone suggests that you do not Doctor.",
    "No I wouldnt say I\nactually believe in ghosts  to put it crudely.",
    "But I have known curious\nphenomena in the case of sudden or violent death.",
    "But Im more\ninterested in the various superstitions pertaining to violent deaths that a murdered man for instance cant rest in his grave.",
    "And the\ninteresting belief that the blood of a murdered man flows if his\nmurderer touches him.",
    "I wonder how that arose.",
    "Very curious said Thomas.",
    "But I dont suppose many people\nremember that nowadays.",
    "More than you would think.",
    "Of course I dont suppose you have many\nmurders down here so its hard to judge.",
    "Luke had smiled as he spoke his eyes resting with seeming\ncarelessness on the others face.",
    "But Doctor Thomas seemed quite\nunperturbed and smiled in return.",
    "No I dont think weve had a murder for  oh very many years certainly not in my time\n\n\fNo this is a peaceful spot.",
    "Not conducive to foul play.",
    "Unless\nsomebody pushed little Tommy WhatsHisName out of the window.",
    "Luke laughed.",
    "Again Doctor Thomas smile came in answer  a natural\nsmile full of boyish amusement.",
    "A lot of people would have been willing to wring that childs neck he\nsaid but I dont think they actually got to the point of throwing him out\nof windows.",
    "He seems to have been a thoroughly nasty child the removal of him\nmight have been conceived as a public duty.",
    "Its a pity one cant apply that theory fairly often.",
    "Ive always thought a few wholesale murders would be beneficial to\nthe community said Luke.",
    "I havent the respect for human life that\nthe normal Englishman has.",
    "Any man who is a stumbling block on the\nway of progress ought to be eliminated  thats how I see it.",
    "Running his hand through his short fair hair Doctor Thomas said\nYes but who is to be the judge of a mans fitness or unfitness\n\nYoud have to have a scientific man as judge said Luke.",
    "Someone\nwith an unbiased but highly specialized mind  a doctor for instance.",
    "Come to that I think youd be a pretty good judge yourself.",
    "Doctor.",
    "Of unfitness to live\n\n\fYes.",
    "Doctor Thomas shook his head.",
    "My job is to make the unfit fit.",
    "Most of\nthe time its an uphill job Ill admit.",
    "Now just for the sake of argument said Luke.",
    "Take a man like the\nlate Harry Carter \n\nDoctor Thomas said sharply Carter You mean the landlord of the\nSeven Stars\n\nYes thats the man.",
    "I never knew him myself but my cousin Miss\nConway was talking about him.",
    "He seems to have been a really\nthoroughgoing scoundrel.",
    "Well said the other he drank of course.",
    "Illtreated his wife bullied\nhis daughter.",
    "He was quarrelsome and abusive and had had a row\nwith most people in the place.",
    "In fact the world is a better place without him\n\nOne might be inclined to say so I agree.",
    "In fact if somebody had given him a push and sent him into the river\ninstead of his kindly electing to fall in of his own accord that person\nwould have been acting in the public interest\n\nDoctor Thomas said dryly These methods that you advocate  did you\nput them into practice in the  Mayang Straits I think you said\n\n\fLuke laughed.",
    "Oh no with me its theory not practice.",
    "No I do not think you are the stuff of which murderers are made.",
    "Tell me  it interests me  have you ever come across a man you\nbelieved might be a murderer\n\nDoctor Thomas said sharply Really what an extraordinary question\n\nIs it After all a doctor must come across so many queer characters.",
    "He would be better able to detect for instance the signs of homicidal\nmania in an early stage before its noticeable.",
    "Thomas said rather irritably You have the general laymans idea of a\nhomicidal maniac  a man who runs amok with a knife a man more or\nless foaming at the mouth.",
    "Let me tell you a homicidal lunatic may be\nthe most difficult thing on this earth to spot.",
    "To all seeming he may be\nexactly like everyone else  a man perhaps who is easily frightened\nwho may tell you perhaps that he has enemies.",
    "No more than that.",
    "A\nquiet inoffensive fellow.",
    "Is that really so\n\nOf course its so.",
    "A homicidal lunatic often kills as he thinks in selfdefense.",
    "But of course a lot of killers are ordinary sane fellows like\nyou and me.",
    "Doctor you alarm me Fancy if you should discover later that I have\nfive or six quiet little killings to my credit.",
    "Doctor Thomas smiled.",
    "I dont think its very likely Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "Dont you Ill return the compliment.",
    "I dont believe youve got five or\nsix murders to your credit either.",
    "Doctor Thomas said cheerfully Youre not counting my professional\nfailures.",
    "Both men laughed.",
    "Luke got up and said goodbye.",
    "Im afraid Ive\ntaken up a lot of your time he said apologetically.",
    "Oh Im not busy.",
    "Wychwood is a pretty healthy place.",
    "Its a pleasure\nto have a talk with someone from the outside world.",
    "I was wondering  said Luke and stopped.",
    "Yes\n\nMiss Conway told me when she sent me to you what a very  well\nwhat a firstclass man you were.",
    "I wondered if you didnt feel rather\nburied down here Not much opportunity for talent.",
    "Oh general practice is a good beginning.",
    "Its valuable experience.",
    "But you wont be content to stay in a rut all your life.",
    "Your late partner.",
    "Doctor Humbleby was an unambitious fellow so Ive heard  quite\ncontent with his practice here.",
    "Hed been here for a good many years I\nbelieve.",
    "Practically a lifetime.",
    "He was sound but oldfashioned so I hear.",
    "Doctor Thomas said At times he was difficult.",
    "Very suspicious of\nmodern innovations but a good example of the old school of\nphysicians.",
    "Left a very pretty daughter Im told said Luke in jocular fashion.",
    "He had the pleasure of seeing Doctor Thomas pale pink countenance\ngo a deep scarlet.",
    "Oh  er  yes he said.",
    "Luke gazed at him kindly.",
    "He was pleased at the prospect of erasing\nDoctor Thomas from his list of suspected persons.",
    "The latter\nrecovered his normal hue and said abruptly Talking about crime just\nnow I can lend you rather a good book as you are interested in the\nsubject.",
    "Translation from the German.",
    "Kreuzhammer on Inferiority and\nCrime.",
    "Thank you said Luke.",
    "Doctor Thomas ran his finger along a shelf and drew out the book in\nquestion.",
    "Here you are.",
    "Some of the theories are rather startling and\nof course they are only theories but they are interesting.",
    "The early life\nof Menzheld for instance the Frankfurt butcher as they called him\nand the chapter on Anna Helm the little nursemaid killer are really\nextremely interesting.",
    "She killed about a dozen of her charges before the authorities\ntumbled to it I believe said Luke.",
    "Doctor Thomas nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "She had a most sympathetic personality\n devoted to children and apparently quite genuinely heartbroken at\neach death.",
    "The psychology is amazing.",
    "Amazing how these people get away with it.",
    "He was on the doorstep now.",
    "Doctor Thomas had come out with him.",
    "Not amazing really said Doctor Thomas.",
    "Its quite easy you know.",
    "What is\n\nTo get away with it.",
    "He was smiling again  a charming boyish smile.",
    "If youre careful.",
    "One just has to be careful thats all.",
    "But a clever\nman is extremely careful not to make a slip.",
    "Thats all there is to it.",
    "He\nsmiled again and went into the house.",
    "Luke stood staring up the steps.",
    "There had been something\ncondescending in the doctors smile.",
    "Throughout their conversation\nLuke had been conscious of himself as a man of full maturity and of\nDoctor Thomas as a youthful and ingenuous young man.",
    "Just for the moment he felt the roles reversed The doctors smile had\nbeen that of a grownup amused by the cleverness of a child.",
    "Chapter 9\n\n\fIn the little shop in the High Street Luke had bought a tin of cigarettes\nand todays copy of Good Cheer the enterprising little weekly which\nprovided Lord Easterfield with a good portion of his substantial\nincome.",
    "Turning to the football competition Luke with a groan gave\nforth the information that he had just failed to win a hundred and\ntwenty pounds.",
    "Mrs. Pierce was roused at once to sympathy and\nexplained similar disappointments on the part of her husband.",
    "Friendly relations thus established Luke found no difficulty in\nprolonging the conversation.",
    "A great interest in football Mr. Pierce takes said Mr. Pierces\nspouse.",
    "Turns to it first of all in the news he does.",
    "And as I say many\na disappointment hes had but there everybody cant win thats what\nI say and what I say is you cant go against luck.",
    "Luke concurred heartily in these sentiments and proceeded to\nadvance by an easy transition to a further profound statement that\ntroubles never come singly.",
    "Ah no indeed sir that I do know.",
    "Mrs. Pierce sighed.",
    "And when a\nwoman has a husband and eight children  six living and buried two\nthat is  well she knows what trouble is as you may say.",
    "I suppose she does.",
    "Oh undoubtedly said Luke.",
    "Youve  er  buried\ntwo you say\n\nOne no longer than a month ago said Mrs. Pierce with a kind of\nmelancholy enjoyment.",
    "Dear me very sad.",
    "It wasnt only sad sir.",
    "It was a shock thats what it was  a shock I\ncame all over queer I did when they broke it to me.",
    "Never having\nexpected anything of that kind to happen to Tommy as you might say\nfor when a boys trouble to you it doesnt come natural to think of him\nbeing took.",
    "Now my Emma Jane a sweet little mite she was.",
    "Youll\nnever rear her.",
    "Thats what they said.",
    "Shes too good to live.",
    "And it\nwas true sir.",
    "The Lord knows his own.",
    "Luke acknowledged the sentiment and strove to return from the\nsubject of the saintly Emma Jane to that of the less saintly Tommy.",
    "Your boy died quite recently he asked.",
    "An accident\n\nAn accident it was sir.",
    "Cleaning the windows of the old hall which is\nnow the library and he must have lost his balance and fell  from the\ntop windows that was.",
    "Mrs. Pierce expatiated at some length on all the details of the accident.",
    "Wasnt there some story said Luke carelessly of his having been\nseen dancing on the window sill\n\nMrs. Pierce said that boys would be boys but no doubt it did give the\nMajor a turn him being a fussy gentleman.",
    "Major Horton\n\n\fYes sir the gentleman with the bulldogs.",
    "After the accident\nhappened he chanced to mention having seen our Tommy acting very\nrashlike  and of course it does show that if something sudden had\nstartled him he would have fallen easy enough.",
    "High spirits sir that\nwas Tommys trouble.",
    "A sore trial hes been to me in many ways she\nfinished but there it was just high spirits  nothing but high spirits\nsuch as any lad might have.",
    "There wasnt no real harm in him as you\nmight say.",
    "No no Im sure there wasnt but sometimes you know Mrs. Pierce\npeople  sober middleaged people  find it hard to remember theyve\never been young themselves.",
    "Mrs. Pierce sighed.",
    "Very true those words are sir.",
    "I cant help but\nhope that some gentlemen I could name but wont will have taken it to\nheart the way they were hard upon the lad just on account of his high\nspirits.",
    "Played a few tricks upon his employers did he asked Luke with an\nindulgent smile.",
    "Mrs. Pierce responded immediately It was just his fun sir that was\nall.",
    "Tommy was always good at imitations.",
    "Make us hold our sides with\nlaughing the way hed pretend to be that Mr. Ellsworthy at the curio\nshop or old Mr. Hobbs the churchwarden and he was imitating his\nlordship up at the Manor and the two undergardeners laughing when\nup came his lordship quiet like and gave Tommy the sack on the spot\nand naturally that was only to be expected and quite right and his\nlordship didnt bear malice afterwards and helped Tommy to get\nanother job.",
    "But other people werent so magnanimous eh said Luke.",
    "That they were not sir.",
    "Naming no names.",
    "And youd never think it\nwith Mr. Abbot so pleasant in his manner and always a kind word or a\njoke.",
    "Tommy got into trouble with him\n\nMrs. Pierce said Its not Im sure that the boy meant any harm.",
    "And\nafter all if papers are private and not meant to be looked at they\nshouldnt be laid out on a table  thats what I say.",
    "Oh quite said Luke.",
    "Private papers in a lawyers office ought to be\nkept in the safe.",
    "Thats right sir.",
    "Thats what I think and Mr. Pierce he agrees with\nme.",
    "Its not even as though Tommy had read much of it.",
    "What was it  a will asked Luke.",
    "He judged  probably rightly  that a\nquestion as to what the document in question had been might make\nMrs. Pierce halt.",
    "But this direct question brought an instant response.",
    "Oh no sir nothing of that kind.",
    "Nothing really important.",
    "Just a\nprivate letter it was  from a lady  and Tommy didnt even see who the\nlady was.",
    "All such a fuss about nothing  thats what I say.",
    "Mr. Abbot must be the sort of man who takes offense very easily\nsaid Luke.",
    "Well it does seem so doesnt it sir Although as I say hes always\nsuch a pleasant gentleman to speak to  always a joke or a cheery\nword.",
    "But its true that I have heard he was a difficult man to get up\nagainst and him and Doctor Humbleby was daggers drawn as the\nsaying is just before the poor gentleman died.",
    "And not a pleasant\nthought for Mr. Abbot afterwards.",
    "For once theres a death one\ndoesnt like to think theres been harsh words spoken and no chance\nof taking them back.",
    "Luke shook his head solemnly and murmured Very true  very true.",
    "He went on A bit of a coincidence that.",
    "Hard words with Doctor\nHumbleby and Doctor Humbleby died harsh treatment of your\nTommy and the boy dies.",
    "I should think that a double experience like\nthat would tend to make Mr. Abbot careful of his tongue in future.",
    "Harry Carter too down at the Seven Stars said Mrs. Pierce.",
    "Very\nsharp words passed between them only a week before Carter went\nand drowned himself but one cant blame Mr. Abbot for that.",
    "The\nabuse was all on Carters side.",
    "Went up to Mr. Abbots house he did\nbeing in liquor at the time and shouting out the foulest language at the\ntop of his voice.",
    "Poor Mrs. Carter she had a deal to put up with and it\nmust be owned.",
    "Carters death was a merciful release as far as she\nwas concerned.",
    "He left a daughter too didnt he\n\nAh said Mrs. Pierce Im never one to gossip.",
    "This was\nunexpected but promising.",
    "Luke pricked up his ears and waited.",
    "I\ndont say there was anything in it but talk.",
    "Lucy Carters a finelooking\nyoung woman in her way and if it hadnt been for the difference in\n\n\fstation I dare say no notice would have been taken.",
    "But talk there has\nbeen and you cant deny it especially after Carter went right up to his\nhouse shouting and swearing.",
    "Luke gathered the implications of this somewhat confused speech.",
    "Mr. Abbot looks as though hed appreciate a goodlooking girl he\nsaid.",
    "Its often the way with gentlemen said Mrs. Pierce.",
    "They dont mean\nanything by it  just a word or two in passing  but the gentrys the\ngentry and it gets noticed in consequence.",
    "Its only to be expected in a\nquiet place like this.",
    "Its a very charming place said Luke.",
    "So unspoilt.",
    "Thats what artists always say but I think were a bit behind the times\nmyself.",
    "Why theres been no building here to speak of.",
    "Over at\nAshevale for instance theyve got a lovely lot of new houses some of\nthem with green roofs and stained glass in the windows.",
    "Luke shuddered slightly.",
    "Youve got a grand new Institute here he\nsaid.",
    "They say its a very fine building said Mrs. Pierce without great\nenthusiasm.",
    "Of course his lordships done a lot for the place.",
    "He\nmeans well we all know that.",
    "But you dont think his efforts are quite successful said Luke\namused.",
    "Well of course sir he isnt really gentry  not like Miss Waynflete for\ninstance and Miss Conway.",
    "Why Lord Easterfields father kept a boot\nshop only a few doors from here.",
    "My mother remembers Gordon Ragg\nserving in the shop  remembers it as well as anything.",
    "Of course hes\nhis lordship now and hes a rich man but its never the same is it sir\n\nEvidently not said Luke.",
    "Youll excuse me mentioning it sir said Mrs. Pierce.",
    "And of course I\nknow youre staying at the Manor and writing a book.",
    "But youre a\ncousin of Miss Bridgets I know and thats quite a different thing.",
    "Very\npleased we shall be to have her back as mistress of Ashe Manor.",
    "Rather said Luke.",
    "Im sure you will.",
    "He paid for his cigarettes and paper with sudden abruptness.",
    "He\nthought to himself The personal element.",
    "One must keep that out of\nit.",
    "Hell Im here to track down a criminal.",
    "What does it matter who that\nblackhaired witch marries or doesnt marry She doesnt come into\nthis.",
    "He walked slowly along the street.",
    "With an effort he thrust Bridget into\nthe back of his mind.",
    "Now then he said to himself.",
    "Abbot.",
    "The case\nagainst Abbot.",
    "Ive linked him up with three of the victims.",
    "He had a\nrow with Humbleby a row with Carter and a row with Tommy Pierce\nand all three died.",
    "What about the girl Amy Gibbs What was the\nprivate letter that infernal boy saw Did he know who it was from Or\ndidnt he He maynt have said so to his mother.",
    "But suppose he did.",
    "Suppose Abbot thought it necessary to shut his mouth.",
    "It could be.",
    "Thats all one can say about it.",
    "It could be.",
    "Not good enough.",
    "Luke quickened his pace looking about him with sudden exasperation.",
    "This damned village  its getting on my nerves.",
    "So smiling and\npeaceful so innocent and all the time this crazy streak of murder\nrunning through it.",
    "Or am I the crazy one Was Lavinia Fullerton\ncrazy After all the whole thing could be coincidence  yes\nHumblebys death and all.",
    "He glanced back down the length of the\nHigh Street and he was assailed by a strong feeling of unreality.",
    "He\nsaid to himself These things dont happen.",
    "Then he lifted his eyes to the long frowning line of Ashe Ridge and at\nonce the unreality passed.",
    "Ashe Ridge was real it knew strange things\n witchcraft and cruelty and forgotten blood lusts and evil rites.",
    "He startled.",
    "Two figures were walking along the side of the ridge.",
    "He\nrecognized them easily  Bridget and Ellsworthy.",
    "The young man was\ngesticulating with those curious unpleasant hands of his.",
    "His head was\nbent to Bridgets.",
    "They looked like two figures out of a dream.",
    "One felt\nthat their feet made no sound as they sprang catlike from tuft to tuft.",
    "He saw her black hair stream out behind her blown by the wind.",
    "Again\nthat queer magic of hers held him.",
    "Bewitched thats what I am betwitched he said to himself.",
    "He stood quite still a queer numbed feeling spreading over him.",
    "He\nthought to himself ruefully Whos to break the spell Theres no one.",
    "Chapter 10\n\n\fA soft sound behind him made him turn sharply.",
    "A girl was standing\nthere a remarkably pretty girl with brown hair curling round her ears\nand rather timidlooking dark blue eyes.",
    "She flushed a little with\nembarrassment before she spoke.",
    "Mr. Fitzwilliam isnt it she said.",
    "Yes.",
    "I \n\nIm Rose Humbleby.",
    "Bridget told me that  that you knew some people\nwho knew my father.",
    "Luke had the grace to flush slightly under his tan.",
    "It was a long time\nago he said rather lamely.",
    "They  er  knew him as a young man before he was married.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Rose Humbleby looked a little crestfallen.",
    "But she went on\nYoure writing a book arent you\n\nYes.",
    "Im making notes for one that is.",
    "About local superstitions.",
    "All\nthat sort of thing.",
    "I see.",
    "It sounds frightfully interesting.",
    "Luke smiled at her.",
    "He thought Our Doctor Thomas is in luck.",
    "There are people he said who can make the most exciting subject\nunbearably boring.",
    "Im afraid Im one of them.",
    "Rose Humbleby smiled back.",
    "Then she said Do you believe in  in\nsuperstitions and all that\n\n\fThats a difficult question.",
    "It doesnt follow you know.",
    "One can be\ninterested in things one doesnt believe in.",
    "Yes I suppose so.",
    "The girl sounded doubtful.",
    "Are you superstitious\n\nNno I dont think so.",
    "But I do think things come in  in waves.",
    "Waves\n\nWaves of bad luck and good luck.",
    "I mean I feel as though lately all\nWychwood was under a spell of  of misfortune.",
    "Father dying and Miss\nFullerton being run over and that little boy who fell out of the window.",
    "I\n I began to feel as though I hated this place  as though I must get\naway.",
    "Her breath came rather faster.",
    "Luke looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "So\nyou feel like that\n\nOh I know its silly.",
    "I suppose really it was poor Daddy dying so\nunexpectedly  it was so horribly sudden.",
    "She shivered.",
    "And then\nMiss Fullerton.",
    "She said  The girl paused.",
    "What did she say She was a delightful old lady I thought  very like a\nrather special aunt of mine.",
    "Oh did you know her Roses face lit up.",
    "I was very fond of her and\nshe was devoted to Daddy.",
    "But Ive sometimes wondered if she was\nwhat the Scotch call fey.",
    "Why\n\nBecause  its so odd  she seemed quite afraid that something was\ngoing to happen to Daddy.",
    "She almost warned me.",
    "Especially about\naccidents.",
    "And then that day just before she went up to town she was\nso odd in her manner  absolutely in a dither.",
    "I really do think Mr.\nFitzwilliam that she was one of those people who have second sight.",
    "I\nthink she knew that something was going to happen to her.",
    "And she\nmust have known that something was going to happen to Daddy too.",
    "Its  its rather frightening that sort of thing She moved a step nearer\nto him.",
    "There are times when one can foresee the future said Luke.",
    "It isnt\nalways supernatural though.",
    "No I suppose its quite natural really  just a faculty that most people\nlack.",
    "All the same it worries me.",
    "You mustnt worry said Luke gently.",
    "Remember its all behind you\nnow.",
    "Its no good going back over the past.",
    "Its the future one has to\nlive for.",
    "I know.",
    "But theres more you see.",
    "Rose hesitated.",
    "There was\nsomething  to do with your cousin.",
    "My cousin Bridget\n\n\fYes.",
    "Miss Fullerton was worried about her in the same way.",
    "She was\nalways asking me questions.",
    "I think she was afraid for her too.",
    "Luke turned sharply scanning the hillside.",
    "He had an unreasoning\nsense of fear for Bridget.",
    "Fancy  all fancy Ellsworthy was only a\nharmless dilettante who played at shopkeeping.",
    "As though reading his\nthoughts.",
    "Rose said Do you like Mr. Ellsworthy\n\nEmphatically no.",
    "Geoffrey  Doctor Thomas you know  doesnt like him either.",
    "And you\n\nOh no I think hes dreadful.",
    "She drew a little nearer.",
    "Theres a lot of\ntalk about him.",
    "I was told that he had some queer ceremony in the\nWitches Meadow  a lot of his friends came down from London frightfully queerlooking people.",
    "And Tommy Pierce was a kind of\nacolyte.",
    "Tommy Pierce said Luke sharply.",
    "Yes.",
    "He had a surplice and a red cassock.",
    "When was this\n\nOh some time ago.",
    "I think it was in March.",
    "Tommy Pierce seems to have been mixed up in everything that ever\ntook place in this village.",
    "Rose said He was frightfully inquisitive.",
    "He always had to know\nwhatever was going on.",
    "He probably knew a bit too much in the end said Luke grimly.",
    "Rose accepted the words at their face value.",
    "He was rather an odious little boy.",
    "He liked cutting up wasps and he\nteased dogs.",
    "The kind of boy whose decease is hardly to be regretted.",
    "No I suppose not.",
    "It was terrible for his mother though.",
    "I gather she has six blessings left to console her.",
    "Shes got a good\ntongue that woman.",
    "She does talk a lot doesnt she\n\nAfter buying a few cigarettes from her I feel I know the full history of\neveryone in the place.",
    "Rose said ruefully Thats the worst of a place like this.",
    "Everybody\nknows everything about everybody else.",
    "Oh no said Luke.",
    "She looked at him inquiringly.",
    "Luke said with significance No one human being knows the full truth\nabout another human being.",
    "Not even ones nearest and dearest.",
    "Not even  She stopped.",
    "Oh I suppose youre right but I wish you\nwouldnt say frightening things like that Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "Does it frighten you\n\nSlowly she nodded her head.",
    "Then she turned abruptly.",
    "I must be\ngoing now.",
    "If  if you have nothing better to do  I mean if you could  do\ncome and see us.",
    "Mother would  would like to see you because of your\nknowing friends of Daddys so long ago.",
    "She walked slowly away down the road.",
    "Her head was bent a little as\nthough some weight of care or perplexity bowed it down.",
    "Luke stood looking after her.",
    "A sudden wave of solicitude swept over\nhim.",
    "He felt a longing to shield and protect this girl.",
    "From what Asking\nhimself the question he shook his head with a momentary impatience\nat himself.",
    "It was true that Rose Humbleby had recently lost her father\nbut she had a mother and she was engaged to be married to a\ndecidedly attractive young man who was fully adequate to anything in\nthe protection line.",
    "Then why should he Luke Fitzwilliam be assailed\nby this protection complex\n\nAll the same he said to himself as he strolled on toward the looming\nmass of Ashe Ridge I like that girl.",
    "Shes much too good for Thomas a cool superior devil like that.",
    "A memory of the doctors last smile on the doorstep recurred to him.",
    "Decidedly smug it had been Complacent\n\nThe sound of footsteps a little way ahead roused Luke from his slightly\nirritable meditations.",
    "He looked up to see young Mr. Ellsworthy coming\ndown the path from the hillside.",
    "His eyes were on the ground and he\nwas smiling to himself.",
    "His expression struck Luke disagreeably.",
    "Ellsworthy was not so much walking as prancing  like a man who\nkeeps time to some devilish little jig running in his brain.",
    "His smile was\na strange secret contortion of the lips it had a gleeful slyness that was\ndefinitely unpleasant.",
    "Luke had stopped and Ellsworthy was nearly\nabreast of him when he at last looked up.",
    "His eyes malicious and\ndancing met the other mans for just a minute before recognition\ncame.",
    "Then  or so it seemed to Luke  a complete change came over\nthe man.",
    "Where a minute before there had been the suggestion of a\ndancing satyr there was now a somewhat priggish young man.",
    "Oh\nMr. Fitzwilliam good morning.",
    "Good morning said Luke.",
    "Have you been admiring the beauties of\nNature\n\nMr. Ellsworthys long pale hands flew up in a reproving gesture.",
    "Oh\nno no.",
    "I abhor Nature.",
    "But I do enjoy life Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "So do I said Luke.",
    "Mens sana in corpore sano said Mr. Ellsworthy.",
    "His tone was\ndelicately ironic.",
    "Im sure thats so true of you.",
    "There are worse things said Luke.",
    "My dear fellow Sanity is the one\nunbelievable bore.",
    "One must be mad slightly twisted  then one sees\nlife from a new and entrancing angle.",
    "The lepers squint suggested Luke.",
    "Oh very good very good quite witty But theres something in it you\nknow.",
    "An interesting angle of vision.",
    "But I mustnt detain you.",
    "Youre\nhaving exercise.",
    "One must have exercise  the publicschool spirit\n\nAs you say said Luke and with a curt nod walked on.",
    "He thought\nIm getting too darned imaginative.",
    "The fellows just an ass thats all.",
    "But some indefinable uneasiness drove his feet on faster.",
    "That queer\nsly triumphant smile that Ellsworthy had had on his face  was that just\nimagination on his Lukes part And his subsequent impression that it\nhad been wiped off as though by a sponge the moment the other man\ncaught sight of Luke coming toward him  what of that And with\nquickening uneasiness he thought Bridget Is she all right They\ncame up here together and he came back alone.",
    "He hurried on.",
    "The sun had come out while he was talking to Rose\nHumbleby.",
    "Now it had gone in again.",
    "The sky was dull and menacing\nand wind came in sudden erratic little puffs.",
    "It was as though he had\nstepped out of normal everyday life into that queer half world of\nenchantment the consciousness of which had enveloped him ever\nsince he came to Wychwood.",
    "He turned a corner and came out on the\nflat ledge of green grass that had been pointed out to him from below\nand which went he knew by the name of Witches Meadow.",
    "It was\n\n\fhere so tradition had it that the witches had held revelry on Walpurgis\nNight and Halloween.",
    "And then a quick wave of relief swept over him.",
    "Bridget was here.",
    "She\nsat with her back against a rock on the hillside.",
    "She was sitting bent\nover her head in her hands.",
    "He walked quickly over to her.",
    "Lovely\nspring turf strangely green and fresh.",
    "He said Bridget\n\nSlowly she raised her face from her hands.",
    "Her face troubled him.",
    "She\nlooked as though she were returning from some faroff world as\nthough she had difficulty in adjusting herself to the world of now and\nhere.",
    "Luke said rather inadequately I say youre  youre all right arent\nyou\n\nIt was a minute or two before she answered  as though she still had\nnot quite come back from that faroff world that had held her.",
    "Luke felt\nthat his words had to travel a long way before they reached her.",
    "Then she said Of course Im all right.",
    "Why shouldnt I be And now\nher voice was sharp and almost hostile.",
    "Luke grinned.",
    "Im hanged if I know.",
    "I got the windup about you\nsuddenly.",
    "Why\n\nMainly I think because of the melodramatic atmosphere in which Im\nliving at present.",
    "It makes me see things out of all proportion.",
    "If I lose\n\n\fsight of you for an hour or two I naturally assume that the next thing\nwill be to find your gory corpse in a ditch.",
    "It would be in a play or a\nbook.",
    "Heroines are never killed said Bridget.",
    "No but   Luke stopped just in time.",
    "What were you going to say\n\nNothing.",
    "Thank goodness he had just stopped himself in time.",
    "One couldnt\nvery well say to an attractive young woman But youre not the\nheroine.",
    "Bridget went on They are abducted imprisoned left to die of sewer\ngas or be drowned in cellars they are always in danger but they dont\never die.",
    "Nor even fade away said Luke.",
    "He went on So this is the Witches\nMeadow\n\nYes.",
    "He looked down at her.",
    "You only need a broomstick he said kindly.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Mr. Ellsworthy said much the same.",
    "I met him just now said Luke.",
    "Did you talk to him at all\n\nYes.",
    "I think he tried to annoy me.",
    "Did he succeed\n\nHis methods were rather childish.",
    "He paused and then went on\nabruptly Hes an odd sort of fellow.",
    "One minute you think hes just a\nmess and then suddenly one wonders if there isnt a bit more to it than\nthat.",
    "Bridget looked up at him.",
    "Youve felt that too\n\nYou agree then\n\nYes.",
    "Luke waited.",
    "Bridget said Theres something  odd about him.",
    "Ive been wondering you know.",
    "I lay awake last night racking my\nbrains.",
    "About the whole business.",
    "It seemed to me that if there was a a killer about I ought to know who it was.",
    "I mean living down here\nand all that.",
    "I thought and thought and it came to this  if there is a\nkiller he must definitely be mad.",
    "Thinking of what Doctor Thomas had said Luke asked You dont\nthink that a murderer can be as sane as you or I\n\nNot this kind of a murderer.",
    "As I see it this murderer must be crazy.",
    "And that you see brought me straight to Ellsworthy.",
    "Of all the people\ndown here hes the only one who is definitely queer.",
    "He is queer you\ncant get away from it\n\n\fLuke said doubtfully There are a good many of his sort  dilettantes\nposeurs  usually quite harmless.",
    "Yes.",
    "But I think there might be a little more than that.",
    "Hes got such\nnasty hands.",
    "You noticed that Funny I did too\n\nTheyre not just white theyre green.",
    "They do give one that effect.",
    "All the same you cant convict a man of\nbeing a murderer because of the color of his flesh.",
    "Oh quite.",
    "What we want is evidence.",
    "Evidence growled Luke.",
    "Just the one thing thats absolutely\nlacking.",
    "The mans been too careful.",
    "A careful murderer A careful\nlunatic\n\nIve been trying to help said Bridget.",
    "With Ellsworthy you mean\n\nYes.",
    "I thought I could probably tackle him better than you could.",
    "Ive\nmade a beginning.",
    "Tell me.",
    "Well it seems that he has a kind of little coterie  a band of nasty\nfriends.",
    "They come down here from time to time and celebrate.",
    "Do you mean what are called nameless orgies\n\nI dont know about nameless but certainly orgies.",
    "Actually it all\nsounds very silly and childish.",
    "I suppose they worship the devil and do obscene dances.",
    "Something of the kind.",
    "Apparently they get a kick out of it.",
    "I can contribute something to this said Luke.",
    "Tommy Pierce took\npart in one of their ceremonies.",
    "He was an acolyte.",
    "He had a red\ncassock.",
    "So he knew about it\n\nYes.",
    "And that might explain his death.",
    "You mean he talked about it\n\nYes  or he may have tried a spot of quiet blackmail.",
    "Bridget said thoughtfully I know its all fantastic but it doesnt seem\nquite so fantastic when applied to Ellsworthy as it does to anyone\nelse.",
    "No I agree.",
    "The thing becomes just conceivable instead of being\nludicrously unreal.",
    "Weve got a connection with two of the victims said Bridget.",
    "Tommy\nPierce and Amy Gibbs.",
    "Where do the publican and Humbleby come in\n\nAt the moment they dont.",
    "Not the publican.",
    "But I can imagine a motive for Humblebys removal.",
    "He was a doctor and he may have tumbled to Ellsworthys abnormal\nstate.",
    "Yes thats possible.",
    "Then Bridget laughed.",
    "I did my stuff pretty well this morning.",
    "My\npsychic possibilities are grand it seems and when I told how one of\nmy greatgreatgrandmothers had a near escape of being burnt for\nwitchcraft my stock went soaring up.",
    "I rather think that I shall be\ninvited to take part in the orgies at the next meeting of the Satanic\nGames whenever that may be.",
    "Luke said Bridget for Gods sake be careful.",
    "She looked at him\nsurprised.",
    "He got up.",
    "I met Humblebys daughter just now.",
    "We were\ntalking about Miss Fullerton.",
    "And the Humbleby girl said that Miss\nFullerton had been worried about you.",
    "Bridget in the act of rising stopped as though frozen into immobility.",
    "Whats that Miss Fullerton worried  about me.",
    "Thats what Rose Humbleby said.",
    "Rose Humbleby said that\n\nYes.",
    "What more did she say\n\nNothing more.",
    "Are you sure\n\nQuite sure.",
    "There was a pause then Bridget said I see.",
    "Miss Fullerton was worried about Humbleby and he died.",
    "Now I hear\nshe was worried about you \n\nBridget laughed.",
    "She stood up and shook her head so that her long\nblack hair flew out round her head.",
    "Dont worry she said.",
    "The devil\nlooks after his own.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nHe leaned back in his chair on the other side of the bank managers\ntable.",
    "Well that seems very satisfactory he said.",
    "Im afraid Ive\nbeen taking up a lot of your time.",
    "Mr. Jones waved a deprecating hand.",
    "His tall dark plump face wore a\nhappy expression.",
    "No indeed Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "This is a quiet spot you know.",
    "We are\nalways glad to see a stranger.",
    "Its a fascinating part of the world said he.",
    "Full of superstitions.",
    "Mr. Jones sighed and said it took a long time for education to eradicate\nsuperstition.",
    "Luke remarked that he thought education was too highly rated\nnowadays and Mr. Jones was slightly shocked by the statement.",
    "Lord Easterfield he said has been a handsome benefactor here.",
    "He realizes the disadvantages under which he himself suffered as a\nchild and does everything to favour the youth nowadays.",
    "These initial disadvantages didt stop him making a great fortune\nsaid Luke.",
    "No hes got capacity... a great capacity.",
    "Or luck said Luke.",
    "Jones seemed somewhat shocked.",
    "Luck is what counts Luke went on.",
    "Look at a murderer for\nexample.",
    "Why is a murderer successful and escapes Is it for his\nhability O just pure luck\n\nJones admitted that it was probably luck and Luke went on\n\nLook at someone like this Carter the pub owner.",
    "This man was\nprobably drunk six nights a week and then one night tumbles from the\nbridge into the river.",
    "Luck again.",
    "Good luck for some.",
    "Pardon me\n\nFor his wife and daughter.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Of course.",
    "A clerk knocked and came in bringing some papers.",
    "Luke signed\ntwice and got his chequebook.",
    "He got up.",
    "Well I am glad that everything is in order.",
    "I had a lot of luck this year\nat the races.",
    "How about you\n\nJones said smiling that he wasnt a gambling man.",
    "He added that Mrs.\nJones had a very particular point of view about this subject.",
    "So I suppose that you didnt watch the Great Cup\n\nActually no.",
    "Someone from here went\n\nMajor Horton went.",
    "He is quite a clever bet.",
    "And Mr. Abbot normally\ndoesnt work on this day.",
    "But he didnt spot the winner.",
    "I dont think many did said Luke and took leave.",
    "He lighted a cigarrette as he left the bank.",
    "Leaving the least probable\nperson theory aside he didnt see a reason for keeping Mr. Jones on\nhis suspect list.",
    "The bank manager hadnt had any reaction to the\nquestions Luke put to him.",
    "It seemed completely impossible to think of\nhim as a murderer.",
    "Furthermore he hadnt been away on the day of\nthe Great Cup.",
    "Accidentally Lukes visit hadnt been lost he got two\ninformations.",
    "Both Major Horton and Mr. Abbot the lawyer had been\naway from Wychwood on the day of the Great Cup.",
    "Any of them could\ntherefore have been in London when Mrs. Fullerton had been run over\nby a car.",
    "Even though he didnt suspect Dr. Thomas at the moment he would be\nmore satisfied if he knew for sure that he had been in Wychwood\nperforming his duties on that day.",
    "He noted down mentally the\nnecessity of verifying this point.",
    "There was also Ellworthy.",
    "Had he\nbeen in Wychwood on that day If he had the assumption that he was\nthe murderer would become much weaker.",
    "Nut there was of course\nthe possibility of Mrs. Fullertons death being an accident.",
    "But he\nrejected this theory.",
    "Her death had been too fortunate.",
    "Luke went into his car and drove it to the Pipeweel Garageon the other\nend of High Street.",
    "The car had some minor troubles that needed\n\n\ffixing.",
    "A young nicelooking mechanic listened courteously to him.",
    "Lifting the hood they became both absorbed in a technical discussion.",
    "A voice called Jim come here for a bit\n\nThe mechanic obeyed.",
    "Jim Harvey.",
    "That was it.",
    "Jim Harvey.",
    "Amy\nGibbs boyfriend.",
    "He came back soon apologizing and the talk\nbecame technical once more.",
    "Luke agreed to leaving his car.",
    "When he\nwas about to say goodbye he asked casually Were you lucky at the\nGreat Cup this year\n\nNo sir.",
    "I placed my bet on Clarigold.",
    "I wonder if many people put their money on Jujube II\n\nActually no sir.",
    "I even think some paper said she hadnt a chance.",
    "Luke shook his head.",
    "Horse races are a risky game.",
    "Did you go to see the Great Cup\n\nNo sir.",
    "I would have liked to.",
    "I had already had a day off this year.",
    "There were cheap return tickets to Epson but the boss wouldnt even\nhear of it.",
    "To tell the truth we were shortstaffed and had a lot of work\nthat day.",
    "Luke said goodbye.",
    "He took Jim Harvey off his list.",
    "This nicelooking\nboy wasnt a murderer and hadnt run Lavinia Fullerton over.",
    "He went home by the river.",
    "There as had happened before he met\nMajor Horton and his dogs.",
    "The Major was still shouting Augustus...\nNelly Nelly... Nero Nero Nero Again the protuberant eyes stared at\nLuke.",
    "But this time there was more to follow.",
    "Major Horton said\nExcuse me Mr. Fitzwilliam isnt it\n\nYes.",
    "Horton here  Major Horton.",
    "Believe Im going to meet you tomorrow\nup at the Manor.",
    "Tennis party.",
    "Miss Conway very kindly asked me.",
    "Cousin of yours isnt she\n\nYes.",
    "Thought so.",
    "Soon spot a new face down here you know.",
    "Here a\ndiversion occurred the two bulldogs advancing upon a nondescript\nwhite mongrel.",
    "Augustus... Nero Come here sir Come here I say\n\nWhen Augustus and Nero had finally reluctantly obeyed the command\nMajor Horton returned to the conversation.",
    "Luke was patting Nelly\nwho was gazing up at him sentimentally.",
    "Nice bitch that isnt she said the Major.",
    "I like bulldogs.",
    "Ive always\nhad em.",
    "Prefer em to any other breed.",
    "My place is just near here\ncome in and have a drink.",
    "Luke accepted and the two men walked together while Major Horton\nheld forth on the subject of dogs and the inferiority of all other breeds\nto that which he himself preferred.",
    "Luke heard of the prizes Nelly had\n\n\fwon of the infamous conduct of a judge in awarding Augustus merely\na Highly Commended and of the triumphs of Nero in the show ring.",
    "By then they had turned in at the Majors gate.",
    "He opened the front\ndoor which was not locked and the two men passed into the house.",
    "Leading the way into a small slightly doggysmelling room lined with\nbookshelves Major Horton busied himself with the drinks.",
    "Luke looked\nround him.",
    "There were photographs of dogs copies of the Field and\nCountry Life and a couple of wellworn armchairs.",
    "Silver cups were\narranged round the bookcases.",
    "There was one oil painting over the\nmantlepiece.",
    "My wife said the Major looking up from the siphon and noting the\ndirection of Lukes glance.",
    "Remarkable woman.",
    "A lot of character in\nher face dont you think\n\nYes indeed said Luke looking at the late Mrs. Horton.",
    "She was\nrepresented in a pink satin dress and was holding a bunch of lilies of\nthe valley.",
    "Her brown hair was parted in the middle and her lips were\npressed grimly together.",
    "Her eyes of a cold gray looked out illtemperedly at the beholder.",
    "A remarkable woman said the Major handing a glass to Luke.",
    "She\ndied over a year ago.",
    "I havent been the same man since.",
    "No said Luke a little at a loss to know what to say.",
    "Sit down said the Major waving a hand toward one of the leather\nchairs.",
    "He himself took the other one and sipping his whisky and soda\nhe went on No I havent been the same man since.",
    "You must miss her said Luke awkwardly.",
    "Major Horton shook his head darkly.",
    "Fellow needs a wife to keep him up to scratch he said.",
    "Otherwise\nhe gets slack  yes slack.",
    "He lets himself go.",
    "But surely \n\nMy boy I know what Im talking about.",
    "Mind you Im not saying\nmarriage doesnt come hard on a fellow at first.",
    "It does.",
    "Fellow says to\nhimself Damn it all he says I cant call my soul my own But he gets\nbroken in.",
    "Its all discipline.",
    "Luke thought that Major Hortons married life must have been more\nlike a military campaign than an idyll of domestic bliss.",
    "Women soliloquized the Major are a rum lot.",
    "It seems sometimes\nthat theres no pleasing them.",
    "But by jove they keep a man up to the\nmark.",
    "Luke preserved a respectful silence.",
    "You married inquired\nthe Major.",
    "No.",
    "Ah well youll come to it.",
    "And mind you my boy theres nothing like\nit.",
    "Its always cheering said Luke to hear someone speak well of the\nmarriage state.",
    "Especially in these days of easy divorce.",
    "Pah said the Major.",
    "Young people make me sick.",
    "No stamina no\nendurance.",
    "They cant stand anything.",
    "No fortitude\n\nLuke itched to ask why such exceptional fortitude should be needed\nbut he controlled himself.",
    "Mind you said the major Lydia was a woman in a thousand  in a\nthousand Everyone here respected and looked up to her.",
    "Yes\n\nShe wouldnt stand any nonsense.",
    "Shed got a way of fixing a person\nwith her eye and the person wilted  just wilted.",
    "Some of these halfbaked girls who call themselves servants nowadays.",
    "They think youll\nput up with any insolence.",
    "Lydia soon showed them Do you know we\nhad fifteen cooks and houseparlormaids in one year.",
    "Fifteen\n\nLuke felt that this was hardly a tribute to Mrs. Nortons domestic\nmanagement but since it seemed to strike his host differently he\nmerely murmured some vague remark.",
    "Turned em out neck and crop she did if they didnt suit.",
    "Was it always that way about asked Luke.",
    "Well of course a lot of them walked out on us.",
    "A good riddance thats what Lydia used to say\n\nA fine spirit said Luke.",
    "But wasnt it sometimes rather awkward\n\n\fOh I didnt mind turning to and putting my hand to things said\nHorton.",
    "Im a pretty fair cook and I can lay a fire with anyone.",
    "Ive\nnever cared for washing up but of course its got to be done you cant\nget away from that.",
    "Luke agreed that you couldnt.",
    "He asked whether Mrs. Horton had\nbeen good at domestic work.",
    "Im not the sort of fellow to let his wife\nwait on him said Major Horton.",
    "And anyway Lydia was far too\ndelicate to do any housework.",
    "She wasnt strong then\n\nMajor Horton shook his head.",
    "She had wonderful spirit.",
    "She wouldnt\ngive in.",
    "But what the woman suffered And no sympathy from the\ndoctors either.",
    "Doctors are callous brutes.",
    "They only understand\ndownright physical pain.",
    "Anything out of the ordinary is beyond most\nof them.",
    "Humbleby for instance everyone seemed to think he was a\ngood doctor.",
    "You dont agree\n\nThe man was an absolute ignoramus.",
    "Knew nothing of modern\ndiscoveries.",
    "Doubt if hed ever heard of a neurosis He understands\nmeasles and mumps and broken bones all right I suppose.",
    "But\nnothing else.",
    "Had a row with him in the end.",
    "He didnt understand\nLydias case at all.",
    "I gave it to him straight from the shoulder and he\ndidnt like it.",
    "Got huffed and backed right out.",
    "Said I could send for any\nother doctor I chose.",
    "After that we had Thomas.",
    "You liked him better\n\nAltogether a much cleverer man.",
    "If anyone could have pulled her\nthrough her last illness Thomas would have done it.",
    "As a matter of\nfact she was getting better but she had a sudden relapse.",
    "Was it painful\n\nHm yes.",
    "Gastritis.",
    "Acute pain sickness all the rest of it.",
    "How that\npoor woman suffered She was a martyr if there ever was one.",
    "And a\ncouple of hospital nurses in the house who were about as sympathetic\nas a brace of grandfather clocks.",
    "The patient this and the patient\nthat.",
    "The Major shook his head and drained his glass.",
    "Cant stand\nhospital nurses So smug.",
    "Lydia insisted they were poisoning her.",
    "That\nwasnt true of course  a regular sick fancy lots of people have it so\nThomas said  but there was this much truth behind it  those women\ndisliked her.",
    "Thats the worst of women  always down on their own\nsex.",
    "I suppose said Luke feeling that he was putting it awkwardly but\nnot seeing how to put it better that Mrs. Horton had a lot of devoted\nfriends in Wychwood\n\nPeople were very kind said the Major somewhat grudgingly.",
    "Easterfield sent down grapes and peaches from his hothouses.",
    "And\nthe old tabbies used to come and sit with her.",
    "Honoria Waynflete and\nLavinia Fullerton.",
    "Miss Fullerton came often did she\n\n\fYes.",
    "Regular old maid but a kind creature Very worried about Lydia\nshe was.",
    "Used to inquire into the diet and the medicines.",
    "All kindly\nmeant you know but what I call a lot of fuss.",
    "Luke nodded comprehendingly.",
    "Cant stand fuss said the Major.",
    "Too many women in this place.",
    "Difficult to get a decent game of golf.",
    "What about the young fellow at the antique shop said Luke.",
    "The Major snorted.",
    "He doesnt play golf.",
    "Has he been in Wychwood long\n\nAbout two years.",
    "Nasty sort of fellow.",
    "Hate those longhaired purring\nchaps.",
    "Funnily enough Lydia liked him.",
    "You cant trust womens\njudgment about men.",
    "They cotton to some amazing bounders.",
    "She\neven insisted on taking some patent quack nostrum of his.",
    "Stuff in a\npurple glass jar with signs of the Zodiac all over it Supposed to be\ncertain herbs picked at the full of the moon.",
    "Lot of tomfoolery but\nwomen swallow that stuff  swallow it literally too  haha\n\nLuke said feeling that he was changing the subject rather abruptly\nbut correctly judging that Major Horton would not be aware of the fact\nWhat sort of a fellow is Abbot the local solicitor Pretty sound on the\nlaw Ive got to have some legal advice about something and I thought\nI might go to him.",
    "They say hes pretty shrewd acknowledged Major Horton.",
    "I dont\nknow.",
    "Matter of fact Ive had a row with him.",
    "Not seen him since he\ncame out here to make Lydias will for her just before she died.",
    "In my\nopinion the mans a cad.",
    "But of course he added that doesnt affect\nhis ability as a lawyer.",
    "No of course not said Luke.",
    "He seems a quarrelsome sort of man\nthough.",
    "Seems to have fallen out with a good many people from what I\nhear.",
    "Trouble with him is that hes so confoundedly touchy said Major\nHorton.",
    "Seems to think hes God Almighty and that anyone who\ndisagrees with him is committing lesemajeste.",
    "Heard of his row with\nHumbleby\n\nThey had a row did they\n\nFirstclass row.",
    "Mind you that doesnt surprise me.",

    "Blood\npoisonings a damned dangerous thing.",
    "Always put iodine on a cut I\ndo Simple precaution.",
    "Humbleby whos a doctor doesnt do anything\nof the sort.",
    "It just shows.",
    "Luke was not quite sure what it showed but\nhe let that pass.",
    "Glancing at his watch he got up.",
    "Major Horton said\nGetting on for lunchtime So it is.",
    "Well glad to have had a chat with\nyou.",

    "We must have\n\n\fa yarn some other time.",
    "Where was your show Mayang Straits Never\nbeen there.",
    "Hear youre writing a book.",
    "Superstitions and all that.",
    "Yes I \n\nBut Major Horton swept on I can tell you several very interesting\nthings.",
    "When I was in India my boy \n\nLuke escaped some ten minutes later after enduring the usual\nhistories of fakirs rope and mango tricks dear to the retired AngloIndian.",
    "As he stepped out into the open air and heard the Majors voice\nbellowing to Nero behind him he marveled at the miracle of married\nlife.",
    "Major Horton seemed genuinely to regret a wife who by all\naccounts not excluding his own must have been nearly allied to a\nmaneating tiger.",
    "Or was it Luke asked himself the question suddenly was it an exceedingly clever bluff\n\nChapter 12\n\nThe afternoon of the tennis party was fortunately fine.",
    "Lord\nEasterfield was in his most genial mood acting the part of the host\nwith a good deal of enjoyment.",
    "He referred frequently to his humble\norigin.",
    "The players were eight in all  Lord Easterfield Bridget Luke\nRose Humbleby Mr. Abbot Doctor Thomas Major Horton and Hetty\nJones a giggling young woman who was the daughter of the bank\nmanager.",
    "In the second set of the afternoon Luke found himself partnering\nBridget against Lord Easterfield and Rose Humbleby.",
    "Rose was a good\nplayer with a strong forehand drive and played in county matches.",
    "She atoned for Lord Easterfields failures and Bridget and Luke who\nwere neither of them particularly strong made quite an even match of\nit.",
    "They were three games all and then Luke found a streak of erratic\nbrilliance and he and Bridget forged ahead to 53.",
    "It was then he\nobserved that Lord Easterfield was losing his temper.",
    "He argued over\na line ball declared a serve to be a fault in spite of Roses disclaimer\nand displayed all the attributes of a peevish child.",
    "It was set point but\nBridget sent an easy shot into the net and immediately after served a\ndouble fault.",
    "Deuce.",
    "The next ball was returned down the middle line\nand as he prepared to take it he and his partner collided.",
    "Then Bridget\nserved another double fault and the game was lost.",
    "Bridget apologized Sorry Ive gone to pieces.",
    "It seemed true enough.",
    "Bridgets shots were wild and she seemed to\nbe unable to do anything right.",
    "The set ended with Lord Easterfield and\nhis partner victorious with the score of 86.",
    "There was a momentary\ndiscussion as to the composition of the next set.",
    "In the end Rose\nplayed again with Mr. Abbot as her partner against Doctor Thomas\nand Miss Jones.",
    "Lord\n\nEasterfield sat\n\ndown\n\nwiping his\n\nforehead\n\nand\n\nsmiling\n\ncomplacently his good humor quite restored.",
    "He began to talk to\nMajor Horton on the subject of a series of articles on Fitness for\nBritain which one of his papers was starting.",
    "Luke said to Bridget\nShow me the kitchen garden.",
    "Why the kitchen garden\n\nI have a feeling for cabbages.",
    "Wont green peas do\n\nGreen peas would be admirable.",
    "They walked away from the tennis court and came to the walled\nkitchen garden.",
    "It was empty of gardeners this Saturday afternoon and\nlooked lazy and peaceful in the sunshine.",
    "Here are your peas said Bridget.",
    "Luke paid no attention to the object of the visit.",
    "He said Why did you\ngive them the set\n\nBridgets eyebrows went up a fraction.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "I went to bits.",
    "My tennis is erratic.",
    "Not so erratic as that Those double faults of yours wouldnt deceive a\nchild And those wild shots  each of them half a mile out\n\nBridget said calmly Thats because Im such a rotten tennis player.",
    "If\nI were a bit better I could perhaps have made it a bit more plausible\nBut as it is if I try to make a ball go just out its always just on the line\nand all the good work still to do.",
    "Oh you admit it then.",
    "Obvious my dear Watson.",
    "And the reason\n\nEqually obvious I should have thought.",
    "Gordon doesnt like losing.",
    "And what about me Supposing I like to win\n\nIm afraid my dear Luke that that isnt equally important.",
    "Would you like to make your meaning just a little clearer still\n\nCertainly if you like.",
    "One mustnt quarrel with ones bread and butter.",
    "Gordon is my bread and butter.",
    "You are not.",
    "Luke drew a deep breath.",
    "Then he exploded.",
    "What do you mean by marrying that absurd little man Why are you\ndoing it\n\nBecause as his secretary I get six pounds a week and as his wife I\nshall get a hundred thousand settled on me a jewel case full of pearls\nand diamonds a handsome allowance and various perquisites of the\nmarried state.",
    "But for somewhat different duties\n\nBridget said coldly Must we have this melodramatic attitude towards\nevery single thing in life If you are contemplating a pretty picture of\n\n\fGordon as an luxurious lover you can wash it right out.",
    "Gordon as you\nshould have realized is a small boy who has not quite grown up.",
    "What\nhe needs is a mother not a wife.",
    "Unfortunately his mother died when\nhe was four years old.",
    "What he wants is someone at hand to whom he\ncan brag someone who will reassure him about himself and who is\nprepared to listen indefinitely to Lord Easterfield on the subject of\nhimself.",
    "Youve got a bitter tongue havent you\n\nBridget retorted sharply I dont tell myself fairy stories if thats what\nyou mean Im a young woman with a certain amount of intelligence\nvery moderate looks and no money.",
    "I intend to earn an honest living.",
    "My job as Gordons wife will be practically indistinguishable from my\njob as Gordons secretary.",
    "After a year I doubt if hell remember to\nkiss me good night.",
    "The only difference is in the salary.",
    "They looked at each other.",
    "Both of them were pale with anger.",
    "Bridget\nsaid jeeringly Go on.",
    "Youre rather oldfashioned arent you Mr.\nFitzwilliam Hadnt you better trot out the old cliches  say that Im\nselling myself for money  thats always a good one I think\n\nLuke said Youre a coldblooded little devil\n\nThats better than being a hotblooded little fool\n\nIs it\n\nYes.",
    "I know.",
    "Luke sneered.",
    "What do you know\n\nI know what it is to care about a man Did you ever meet Johnnie\nCornish I was engaged to him for three years.",
    "He was adorable.",
    "I\ncared like hell about him  cared so much that it hurt Well he threw\nme over and married a nice plump widow with a North Country accent\nand three chins and an income of thirty thousand a year That sort of\nthing rather cures one of romance dont you think\n\nLuke turned away with a sudden groan.",
    "He said It might.",
    "It did.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "The silence lay heavy between them.",
    "Bridget\nbroke it at last.",
    "She said but with a slight uncertainty in her tone I\nhope you realize that you had no earthly right to speak to me as you\ndid.",
    "Youre staying in Gordons house and its damned bad taste.",
    "Luke had recovered his composure.",
    "Isnt that rather a cliche too he\ninquired politely.",
    "Bridget flushed.",
    "Its true anyway.",
    "It isnt.",
    "I had every right.",
    "Nonsense\n\nLuke looked at her.",
    "His face had a queer pallor like a man who is\nsuffering physical pain.",
    "He said I have a right.",
    "Ive the right of caring\nfor you  what did you say just now  of caring so much that it hurts\n\n\fShe drew back a step.",
    "She said You \n\nYes funny isnt it The sort of thing that ought to give you a hearty\nlaugh I came down here to do a job of work and you came round the\ncorner of that house and  how can I say it  put a spell on me Thats\nwhat it feels like.",
    "You mentioned fairy stories just now.",
    "Im caught up in\na fairy story Youve bewitched me.",
    "Ive a feeling that if you pointed\nyour finger at me and said Turn into a frog Id go hopping away with\nmy eyes popping out of my head.",
    "He took a step nearer to her.",
    "I love\nyou like hell Bridget Conway.",
    "And loving you like hell you cant\nexpect me to enjoy seeing you get married to a potbellied pompous\nlittle peer who loses his temper when he doesnt win at tennis.",
    "What do you suggest I should do\n\nI suggest that you should marry me instead.",
    "But doubtless that\nsuggestion will give rise to a lot of merry laughter.",
    "The laughter is positively uproarious.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Well now we know where we are.",
    "Shall we return to the\ntennis court Perhaps this time you will find me a partner who can play\nto win.",
    "Really said Bridget sweetly.",
    "I believe you mind losing just as much\nas Gordon does.",
    "Luke caught her suddenly by the shoulders.",
    "Youve got a devilish tongue havent you Bridget\n\nIm afraid you dont like me very much Luke however great your\npassion for me.",
    "I dont think I like you at all.",
    "Bridget said watching him You meant to get married and settle down\nwhen you came home didnt you\n\nYes.",
    "But not to someone like me\n\nI never thought of anyone in the least like you.",
    "No you wouldnt.",
    "I know your type.",
    "I know it exactly.",
    "You are so clever dear Bridget.",
    "A really nice girl thoroughly English fond of the country and good\nwith dogs.",
    "You probably visualized her in a tweed skirt stirring a log\nfire with the tip of her shoe.",
    "The picture sounds most attractive.",
    "Im sure it does.",
    "Shall we return to the tennis court You can play with\nRose Humbleby.",
    "Shes so good that youre practically certain to win.",
    "Being oldfashioned I must allow you to have the last word.",
    "Again there was a pause.",
    "Then Luke took his hands slowly from her\nshoulders.",
    "They both stood uncertain as though something still unsaid\nlingered between them.",
    "Then Bridget turned abruptly and led the way back.",
    "The next set was\njust ending.",
    "Rose protested against playing again.",
    "Ive played two sets running.",
    "Bridget however insisted.",
    "Im feeling tired.",
    "I dont want to play.",
    "You\nand Mr. Fitzwilliam take on Miss Jones and Major Horton.",
    "But Rose continued to protest and in the end a mens four was\narranged.",
    "Afterward came tea.",
    "Lord Easterfield conversed with Doctor Thomas describing at length\nand with great selfimportance a visit he had recently paid to the\nWellerman Kreitz Research Laboratories.",
    "I wanted to understand the trend of the latest scientific discoveries\nfor myself he explained earnestly.",
    "Im responsible for what my\npapers print.",
    "I feel that very keenly.",
    "This is a scientific age.",
    "Science\nmust be made easily assimilable by the masses.",
    "A little science might possibly be a dangerous thing said Doctor\nThomas with a slight shrug of his shoulders.",
    "Science in the home  thats what we have to aim at said Lord\nEasterfield.",
    "Scienceminded \n\n\fTesttube conscious said Bridget gravely.",
    "I was impressed said Lord Easterfield.",
    "Wellerman took me round\nhimself of course.",
    "I begged him to leave me to an underling but he\ninsisted.",
    "Naturally said Luke.",
    "Lord Easterfield looked gratified.",
    "And he explained everything most\nclearly  the cultures the serum the whole principle of the thing.",
    "He\nagreed to contribute the first article in the series himself.",
    "Mrs. Anstruther murmured They use guinea pigs I believe.",
    "So cruel though of course not so bad as dogs or even cats.",
    "Fellows who use dogs ought to be shot said Major Horton hoarsely.",
    "I really believe Horton said Mr. Abbot that you value canine life\nabove human life.",
    "Every time said the Major.",
    "Dogs cant turn round on you like human\nbeings can.",
    "Never get a nasty word from a dog.",
    "Only a nasty tooth stuck into your leg said Mr. Abbot.",
    "What about\nthat eh Horton\n\nDogs are a good judge of character said Major Horton.",
    "One of your brutes nearly pinned me by the leg last week.",
    "What do\nyou say to that Horton\n\nSame as I said just now\n\nBridget interposed tactfully What about some more tennis\n\nA couple more sets were played.",
    "Then as Rose Humbleby said goodbye Luke appeared beside her.",
    "Ill see you home he said.",
    "And\ncarry the tennis racket.",
    "You havent got a car have you\n\nNo but its no distance.",
    "Id like a walk.",
    "He said no more merely taking her racket and shoes\nfrom her.",
    "They walked down the drive without speaking.",
    "Then Rose\nmentioned one or two trivial matters.",
    "Luke answered rather shortly\nbut the girl did not seem to notice.",
    "As they turned into the gate of her house Lukes face cleared.",
    "Im\nfeeling better now he said.",
    "Were you feeling badly before\n\nNice of you to pretend you didnt notice it.",
    "Youve exorcised the\nbrutes sulky temper though.",
    "Funny I feel as though Id come out of a\ndark cloud into the sun.",
    "So you have.",
    "There was a cloud over the sun when we left the Manor\nand now its passed over.",
    "So it has literally as well as figuratively.",
    "Well well the worlds a good\nplace after all.",
    "Of course it is.",
    "Miss Humbleby may I be impertinent\n\nIm sure you couldnt be.",
    "Oh dont be too sure of that.",
    "I wanted to say that I think Doctor\nThomas is a very lucky man.",
    "Rose blushed and smiled.",
    "So it is true.",
    "You and he are engaged\n\nRose nodded.",
    "Only just now were not announcing it officially.",
    "You\nsee Daddy was against it and it seems  well unkind to  to blazon it\nabroad the moment hes dead.",
    "Your father disapproved\n\nRose bent her head slowly and reluctantly.",
    "Yes Im afraid what it really amounted to was that Daddy didnt  well\ndidnt really like Geoffrey.",
    "They were antagonistic to each other\n\nIt seemed like that sometimes.",
    "Of course Daddy was rather a\nprejudiced old dear.",
    "And I suppose he was very fond of you and didnt like the thought of\nlosing you\n\nRose assented but still with a shade of reservation in her manner.",
    "It went deeper than that asked Luke.",
    "He definitely didnt want\nThomas as a husband for you\n\nNo.",
    "You see.",
    "Daddy and Geoffrey are so very unlike and in some ways\nthey clashed.",
    "Geoffrey was really very patient and good about it but\nknowing Daddy didnt like him made him even more reserved and shy\nin his manner so that Daddy really never got to know him any better.",
    "Prejudices are very hard to combat said Luke.",
    "It was so completely unreasonable\n\nYour father didnt advance any reasons\n\nOh no.",
    "He couldnt Naturally I mean there wasnt anything he could\nsay against Geoffrey except that he didnt like him.",
    "I do not love thee Doctor Fell\n\nThe reason why I cannot tell.",
    "Exactly.",
    "No tangible thing to get hold of I mean your Geoffrey doesnt drink\nor back horses\n\nOh no.",
    "I dont believe Geoffrey even knows what won the Derby.",
    "Thats funny said Luke.",
    "You know I could swear I saw your Doctor\nThomas at Epsom on Derby Day.",
    "For a moment he was anxious lest he might already have mentioned\nthat he only arrived in England on that day.",
    "But Rose responded at\nonce quite unsuspiciously.",
    "You thought you saw Geoffrey at the Derby Oh no.",
    "He couldnt get\naway for one thing.",
    "He was over at Ashewold nearly all that day at a\ndifficult confinement case.",
    "What a memory youve got\n\nRose laughed.",
    "I remember that because he told me they called the\nbaby Jujube as a nickname Luke nodded abstractedly.",
    "Anyway said Rose Geoffrey never goes to race meetings.",
    "Hed be\nbored to death.",
    "She added in a different tone Wont you come in I think Mother\nwould like to see you.",
    "If youre sure of that\n\n\fRose led the way into a room where twilight hung rather sadly.",
    "A\nwoman was sitting in an armchair in a curiously huddledup position.",
    "Mother this is Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "Mrs. Humbleby gave a start and shook hands.",
    "Rose went quietly out of\nthe room.",
    "Im glad to see you Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "Some friends of yours knew my\nhusband many years ago so Rose tells me.",
    "Yes Mrs. Humbleby.",
    "He rather hated repeating the lie to the\nwidowed woman but there was no way out of it.",
    "Mrs. Humbleby said I wish you could have met him.",
    "He was a fine\nman and a great doctor.",
    "He cured many people who had been given up\nas hopeless just by the strength of his personality.",
    "Luke said gently Ive heard a lot about him since Ive been here.",
    "I\nknow how much people thought of him.",
    "He could not see Mrs. Humblebys face very distinctly.",
    "Her voice was\nrather monotonous but its very lack of feeling seemed to emphasize\nthe fact that actually feeling was in her strenuously held back.",
    "She\nsaid rather unexpectedly The world is a very wicked place Mr.\nFitzwilliam.",
    "Do you know that\n\nLuke was a little surprised.",
    "Yes perhaps that may be.",
    "She insisted No but you do know it Its important that.",
    "Theres a lot\nof wickedness about.",
    "One must be prepared  to fight it John was.",
    "He\nknew.",
    "He was on the side of the right\n\nLuke said gently I sure he was.",
    "He knew the wickedness there was in this place said Mrs.\nHumbleby.",
    "He knew  She burst suddenly into tears.",
    "Luke murmured Im so sorry and stopped.",
    "She controlled herself as suddenly as she had lost control.",
    "You must\nforgive me she said.",
    "She held out her hand and he took it.",
    "Do come\nand see us while you are here she said.",
    "It would be so good for\nRose.",
    "She likes you so much.",
    "I like her.",
    "I think your daughter is the nicest girl Ive met for a long\ntime Mrs. Humbleby.",
    "Shes very good to me.",
    "Doctor Thomas is a very lucky man.",
    "Yes.",
    "Mrs. Humbleby dropped his hand.",
    "Her voice had gone flat\nagain.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Its all so difficult.",
    "Luke left her standing in the half gloom her fingers nervously twisting\nand untwisting themselves.",
    "As he walked home his mind went over\nvarious aspects of the conversation.",
    "Doctor Thomas had been absent from Wychwood for a good part of\nDerby Day.",
    "He had been absent in a car.",
    "Wychwood was thirtyfive\nmiles from London.",
    "Supposedly he had been attending a confinement\ncase.",
    "Was there more than his word The point he supposed could be\nverified.",
    "His mind went on to Mrs. Humbleby.",
    "What had she meant by\nher insistence on that phrase Theres a lot of wickedness about.",
    "Was she just nervous and overwrought by the shock of her husbands\ndeath Or was there something more to it than that Did she perhaps\nknow something Something that Dr. Humbleby had known before he\ndied\n\nIve got to go on with this said Luke to himself.",
    "Ive got to go on.",
    "Resolutely he averted his mind from the passage of arms that had\ntaken place between him and Bridget.",
    "Chapter 13\n\nOn the following morning Luke came to a decision.",
    "He had he felt\nproceeded as far as he could with indirect inquiries.",
    "It was inevitable\nthat sooner or later he would be forced into the open.",
    "He felt that the\ntime had come to drop the bookwriting camouflage and reveal that he\nhad come to Wychwood with a definite aim in view.",
    "In pursuance of\n\n\fthis plan of campaign he decided to call upon Honoria Waynflete.",
    "He\nbelieved that she had told him what she knew.",
    "He wanted to induce her\nto tell him what she might have guessed.",
    "He had a shrewd idea that\nMiss Waynfletes guesses might be fairly near the truth.",
    "Miss Waynflete received him in a matteroffact manner showing no\nsurprise at his call.",
    "As she sat down near him her prim hands folded\nand her intelligent eyes  so like an amiable goats  fixed on his face\nhe found little difficulty in coming to the object of his visit.",
    "He said I\ndare say you have guessed.",
    "Miss Waynflete that the reason of my\ncoming here is not merely to write a book on local customs Miss\nWaynflete inclined her head and continued to listen.",
    "I am down here to inquire into the circumstances of the death of that\npoor girl Amy Gibbs.",
    "Miss Waynflete said You mean you have been sent down by the\npolice\n\nOh no Im not a plainclothes dick.",
    "He added with a slightly\nhumorous inflection Im afraid Im that wellknown character in\nfiction the private investigator.",
    "I see.",
    "Then it was Bridget Conway who brought you down here Luke\nhesitated a moment.",
    "Then he decided to let it go at that.",
    "Without going\ninto the whole Fullerton story it was difficult to account for his\npresence.",
    "Miss Waynflete was continuing a note of gentle admiration in her\nvoice Bridget is so practical so efficient Im afraid if it had been left\n\n\fto me I should have distrusted my own judgment.",
    "I mean that if you\nare not absolutely sure of a thing it is so difficult to commit yourself to\na definite course of action.",
    "But you are sure arent you\n\nMiss Waynflete said gravely No indeed Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "It is not a\nthing one can be sure about.",
    "I mean it might all be imagination.",
    "Living\nalone with no one to consult or to talk to one might easily become\nmelodramatic and imagine things which had no foundation in fact.",
    "Luke assented readily to this statement recognizing its inherent truth\nbut he added gently But you are sure in your own mind\n\nEven here Miss Waynflete showed a little reluctance.",
    "We are not\ntalking at cross purposes I hope she demurred.",
    "Luke smiled.",
    "You would like me to put it in plain words Very well.",
    "You\ndo think that Amy Gibbs was murdered\n\nHonoria Waynflete flinched a little at the crudity of the language.",
    "She\nsaid I dont feel at all happy about her death.",
    "Not at all happy.",
    "The\nwhole thing is profoundly unsatisfactory in my opinion.",
    "Luke said patiently But you dont think her death was a natural one\n\nNo.",
    "You dont believe it was an accident\n\n\fIt seems to me most improbable.",
    "There are so many \n\nLuke cut her short.",
    "You dont think it was suicide\n\nEmphatically not.",
    "Then said Luke gently you do think that it was murder\n\nMiss Waynflete hesitated gulped and bravely took the plunge.",
    "Yes\nshe said I do\n\nGood.",
    "Now we can get on with things.",
    "But I have really no evidence on which to base that belief Miss\nWaynflete explained anxiously.",
    "It is entirely an idea.",
    "Quite so.",
    "This is a private conversation.",
    "We are merely speaking\nabout what we think and suspect.",
    "We suspect Amy Gibbs was\nmurdered.",
    "Who do we think murdered her\n\nMiss Waynflete shook her head.",
    "She was looking very troubled.",
    "Luke\nsaid watching her Who had reason to murder her\n\nMiss Waynflete said slowly She had had a quarrel I believe with her\nyoung man at the garage Jim Harvey  a most steady superior young\nman.",
    "I know one reads in the papers of young men attacking their\nsweethearts and dreadful things like that but I really cant believe\nthat Jim would do such a thing.",
    "Luke nodded.",
    "Miss Waynflete went on.",
    "Besides I cant believe that he would do it that way.",
    "Climb up to her\n\n\fwindow and substitute a bottle of poison for the other one with the\ncough mixture.",
    "I mean that doesnt seem \n\nLuke came to the rescue as she hesitated.",
    "Its not the act of an angry\nlover I agree In my opinion we can wash Jim Harvey right out.",
    "Amy\nwas killed  were agreeing she was killed  by someone who wanted to\nget her out of the way and who planned the crime carefully so that it\nshould appear to be an accident.",
    "Now have you any idea  any hunch shall we put it like that  who that person could be\n\nMiss Waynflete said No  really  no I havent the least idea\n\nSure\n\nNno no indeed.",
    "Luke looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "The denial he felt\nhad not rung quite true.",
    "He went on You know of no motive\n\nNo motive whatever.",
    "That was more emphatic.",
    "Had she been in many places in Wychwood\n\nShe was with the Hortons for a year before going to Lord Easterfield.",
    "Luke summed up rapidly Its like this then Somebody wanted that\ngirl out of the way.",
    "From the given facts we assume that first it was a\nman and a man of moderately oldfashioned outlook  as shown by the\nhat paint touch  and secondly that it must have been a reasonably\nathletic man since it is clear he must have climbed up over the\nouthouse to the girls window.",
    "You agree on those points\n\n\fAbsolutely said Miss Waynflete.",
    "Do you mind if I go round and have a try myself\n\nNot at all.",
    "I think that is a very good idea.",
    "She led him out by a side door and round to the back yard.",
    "Luke\nmanaged to reach the outhouse roof without much trouble.",
    "From there\nhe could easily raise the sash of the girls window and with a slight\neffort hoist himself into the room.",
    "A few minutes later he rejoined Miss\nWaynflete on the path below wiping his hands on his handkerchief.",
    "Actually its easier than it looks he said.",
    "You want a certain amount\nof muscle thats all.",
    "There were no signs on the sill or outside\n\nMiss Waynflete shook her head.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "Of course the\nconstable climbed up this way.",
    "So that if there were any traces they would be taken to be his.",
    "How\nthe police force assists the criminal Well thats that\n\nMiss Waynflete led the way back to the house.",
    "Was Amy Gibbs a heavy sleeper he asked.",
    "Miss Waynflete replied acidly It was extremely difficult to get her up\nin the morning.",
    "Sometimes I would knock again and again and call out\nto her before she answered.",
    "But then you know Mr. Fitzwilliam\ntheres a saying there are none so deaf as those who will not hear.",
    "Thats true acknowledged Luke.",
    "Well now Miss Waynflete we\ncome to the question of motive.",
    "Starting with the most obvious one do\nyou think there was anything between that fellow Ellsworthy and the\ngirl He added hastily This is just your opinion Im asking.",
    "Only\nthat.",
    "If its a matter of opinion I would say yes.",
    "Luke nodded.",
    "In your opinion would the girl Amy have stuck at a spot\nof blackmail\n\nAgain as a matter of opinion I should say that that was quite\npossible.",
    "Do you happen to know if she had much money in her possession at\nthe time of her death\n\nMiss Waynflete reflected.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "If she had had any unusual\namount I think I should have heard about it.",
    "And she hadnt launched into any unusual extravagance before she\ndied\n\nI dont think so.",
    "That rather militates against the blackmail theory.",
    "The victim usually\npays once before he decides to proceed to extremes.",
    "Theres another\ntheory.",
    "The girl might know something.",
    "What kind of thing\n\n\fShe might have knowledge that was dangerous to someone here in\nWychwood.",
    "Well take a strictly hypothetical case.",
    "Shed been in\nservice in a good many houses here.",
    "Supposing she came to know of\nsomething that would damage say someone like Mr. Abbot\nprofessionally.",
    "Mr. Abbot\n\nLuke said quickly Or possibly some negligence or unprofessional\nconduct on the part of Doctor Thomas.",
    "Miss Waynflete began But surely  and then stopped.",
    "Luke went on Amy Gibbs was housemaid you said in the Hortons\nhouse at the time when Mrs. Horton died.",
    "There was a moments pause then Miss Waynflete said Will you tell\nme Mr. Fitzwilliam why you bring the Hortons into this Mrs. Horton\ndied over a year ago.",
    "Yes and the girl Amy was there at the time.",
    "I see.",
    "What have the Hortons to do with it\n\nI dont know.",
    "I just wondered.",
    "Mrs. Horton died of acute gastritis\ndidnt she\n\nYes.",
    "Was her death at all unexpected\n\nMiss Waynflete said slowly It was to me.",
    "You see she had been\ngetting much better  seemed well on the road to recovery  and then\nshe had a sudden relapse and died.",
    "Was Doctor Thomas surprised\n\nI dont know.",
    "I believe he was.",
    "And the nurses  what did they say\n\nIn my experience said Miss Waynflete hospital nurses are never\nsurprised at any case taking a turn for the worse.",
    "It is recovery that\nsurprises them.",
    "But her death surprised you Luke persisted.",
    "Yes.",
    "I had been with her only the day before and she had seemed\nvery much better talked and seemed quite cheerful.",
    "What did she think about her own illness\n\nShe complained that the nurses were poisoning her.",
    "She had had one\nnurse sent away but she said these two were just as bad.",
    "I suppose you didnt pay much attention to that\n\nWell no I thought it was all part of the illness.",
    "And she was a very\nsuspicious woman and  it may be unkind to say so but she liked to\n\n\fmake herself important.",
    "No doctor ever understood her case and it\nwas never anything simple it must either be some very obscure\ndisease or else somebody was trying to get her out of the way.",
    "Luke tried to make his voice casual.",
    "She didnt suspect her husband\nof trying to do her in\n\nOh no that idea never occurred to her Miss Waynflete paused a\nminute then she asked quietly Is that what you think\n\nLuke said slowly Husbands have done that before and got away with\nit.",
    "Mrs. Horton from all accounts was a woman any man might have\nlonged to be rid of.",
    "And I understand that he came into a good deal of\nmoney on her death.",
    "Yes he did.",
    "What do you think.",
    "Miss Waynflete\n\nYou want my opinion\n\nYes just your opinion.",
    "Miss Waynflete said quietly and deliberately In my opinion.",
    "Major\nHorton was quite devoted to his wife and would never have dreamed of\ndoing such a thing.",
    "Luke looked at her and received the mild amber glance in reply.",
    "It did\nnot waver.",
    "Well he said I expect youre right.",
    "Youd probably know if it was the\nother way round.",
    "Miss Waynflete permitted herself a smile.",
    "We women are good\nobservers you think\n\nAbsolutely first class.",
    "Would Miss Fullerton have agreed with you do\nyou think\n\nI dont think I ever heard Lavinia express an opinion.",
    "What did she think about Amy Gibbs\n\nMiss Waynflete frowned a little as though thinking.",
    "Its difficult to say.",
    "Lavinia had a very curious idea.",
    "What idea\n\nShe thought that there was something odd going on here in\nWychwood.",
    "She thought for instance that somebody pushed Tommy Pierce out\nof that window\n\nMiss Waynflete stared at him in astonishment.",
    "How did you know that Mr. Fitzwilliam\n\nShe told me so.",
    "Not in those words but she gave me the general\nidea.",
    "Miss Waynflete leaned forward pink with excitement.",
    "When was this\nMr. Fitzwilliam\n\nLuke said quietly The day she was killed.",
    "We traveled together to\nLondon.",
    "What did she tell you exactly\n\nShe told me that there had been too many deaths in Wychwood.",
    "She\nmentioned Amy Gibbs and Tommy Pierce and that man Carter.",
    "She\nalso said that Doctor Humbleby would be the next to go.",
    "Miss\n\nWaynflete\n\nnodded\n\nslowly.",
    "Did\n\nshe\n\ntell\n\nyou\n\nwho\n\nwas\n\nresponsible\n\nA man with a certain look in his eyes said Luke grimly.",
    "A look you\ncouldnt mistake according to her.",
    "Shed seen that look in his eye\nwhen he was talking to Humbleby.",
    "Thats why she said Humbleby\nwould be the next to go.",
    "And he was whispered Miss Waynflete.",
    "Oh dear Oh dear She\nleaned back.",
    "Her eyes had a stricken look in them.",
    "Who was the man said Luke.",
    "Come now Miss Waynflete you know\n you must know\n\nI dont.",
    "She didnt tell me.",
    "But you can guess said Luke keenly.",
    "Youve a very shrewd idea of\nwho was in her mind.",
    "Reluctantly Miss Waynflete bowed her head.",
    "Then tell me.",
    "But Miss Waynflete shook her head energetically.",
    "No indeed Youre asking me to do something that is highly improper\nYoure asking me to guess at what may  only may mind you  have\nbeen in the mind of a friend who is now dead.",
    "I couldnt make an\naccusation of that kind\n\nIt wouldnt be an accusation only an opinion.",
    "But Miss Waynflete was unexpectedly firm.",
    "Ive nothing to go on nothing whatever she said.",
    "Lavinia never actually said anything to\nme.",
    "I may think she had a certain idea but you see I might be entirely\nwrong.",
    "And then I should have misled you and perhaps serious\nconsequences might ensue.",
    "It would be very wicked and unfair of me\nto mention a name.",
    "And I may be quite quite wrong In fact I probably\nam wrong\n\nAnd Miss Waynflete set her lips firmly and glared at Luke with a grim\ndetermination.",
    "Luke knew how to accept defeat when he met it.",
    "He realized that Miss\nWaynfletes sense of rectitude and something else more nebulous that\nhe could not quite place were both against him.",
    "He accepted defeat\nwith a good grace and rose to say goodbye.",
    "He had every intention of\nreturning to the charge later but he allowed no hint of that to escape\ninto his manner.",
    "You must do as you think right of course he said.",
    "Thank you for the\nhelp you have given me.",
    "Miss Waynflete seemed to become a little less sure of herself as she\naccompanied him to the door.",
    "I hope you dont think  she began\nthen changed the form of the sentence.",
    "If there is anything else I can\ndo to help you please please let me know.",
    "I will.",
    "You wont repeat this conversation will you\n\nOf course not.",
    "I shant say a word to anybody.",
    "Luke hoped that that\nwas true.",
    "Give my love to Bridget said Miss Waynflete.",
    "Shes such a\nhandsome girl isnt she And clever too.",
    "I  I hope she will be happy.",
    "And as Luke looked a question she added Married to Lord\nEasterfield I mean.",
    "Such a great difference in age.",
    "Yes there is.",
    "Miss Waynflete sighed.",
    "You know that I was engaged to him once\nshe said unexpectedly.",
    "Luke stared in astonishment.",
    "She was nodding her head and smiling\nrather sadly.",
    "A long time ago.",
    "He was such a promising boy.",
    "I had\nhelped him you know to educate himself.",
    "And I was so proud of his his spirit and the way he was determined to succeed.",
    "She sighed\nagain.",
    "My people of course were scandalized.",
    "Class distinctions in\nthose days were very strong.",
    "She added after a minute or two Ive\n\n\falways followed his career with great interest.",
    "My people I think were\nwrong.",
    "Then with a smile she nodded a farewell and went back into\nthe house.",
    "Luke tried to collect his thoughts.",
    "He had placed Miss Waynflete as\ndefinitely old.",
    "He realized now that she was probably still under\nsixty.",
    "Lord Easterfield must be well over fifty.",
    "She might perhaps be a\nyear or two older than he no more.",
    "And he was going to marry\nBridget.",
    "Bridget who was twentyeight.",
    "Bridget who was young and\nalive\n\nOh damn said Luke.",
    "Dont let me go on thinking of it.",
    "The job.",
    "Get\non with the job.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nMiss Church Amy Gibbs aunt was definitely an unpleasant woman.",
    "Her sharp nose shifty eyes and her voluble tongue all alike filled Luke\nwith nausea.",
    "He adopted a curt manner with her and found it\nunexpectedly successful.",
    "What youve got to do he told her is to\nanswer my questions to the best of your ability.",
    "If you hold back\nanything or tamper with the truth the consequences may be extremely\nserious to you.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "I see.",
    "Im sure Im only too willing to tell you anything I can.",
    "Ive never been mixed up with the police \n\n\fAnd you dont want to be finished Luke.",
    "Well if you do as Ive told\nyou there wont be any question of that.",
    "I want to know all about your\nlate niece  who her friends were what money she had anything she\nsaid that might be out of the way.",
    "Well start with her friends.",
    "Who were\nthey\n\nMrs. Church leered at him slyly out of the corner of an unpleasant eye.",
    "Youll be meaning gentlemen sir\n\nHad she any girlfriends\n\nWell hardly  not to speak of sir.",
    "Of course there was girls shed\nbeen in service with but Amy didnt keep up with them much.",
    "You see \n\nShe preferred the sterner sex.",
    "Go on.",
    "Tell me about that.",
    "It was Jim Harvey down at the garage she was actually going with\nsir.",
    "And a nice steady young fellow he was.",
    "You couldnt do better\nIve said to her many a time.",
    "Luke cut in And the others\n\nAgain he got the sly look.",
    "I expect youre thinking of the gentleman\nwho keeps the curiosity shop I didnt like it myself and I tell you that\nstraight sir Ive always been respectable and I dont hold with\ncarryings on But with what girls are nowadays its no use speaking to\nthem.",
    "They go their own way.",
    "And often they live to regret it.",
    "Did Amy live to regret it asked Luke bluntly.",
    "No sir that I do not think.",
    "She went to consult Doctor Thomas on the day of her death.",
    "That\nwasnt the reason\n\nNo sir Im nearly sure it wasnt.",
    "Oh Id take my oath on it Amy had\nbeen feeling ill and out of sorts but it was just a bad cough and cold\nshe had.",
    "It wasnt anything of the kind you suggest Im sure it wasnt\nsir.",
    "Ill take your word for that.",
    "How far had matters gone between her\nand Ellsworthy\n\nMrs. Church leered.",
    "I couldnt exactly say sir.",
    "Amy wasnt one for\nconfiding in me.",
    "Luke said curtly But theyd gone pretty far\n\nMrs. Church said smoothly The gentleman hasnt got at all a good\nreputation here sir.",
    "All sorts of goings on.",
    "And friends down from town\nand many queer happenings.",
    "Up in the Witches Meadow in the middle\nof the night.",
    "Did Amy go\n\nShe did go once sir I believe.",
    "Stayed out all night and his lordship\nfound out about it  she was at the Manor then  and spoke to her pretty\nsharp and she sauced him back and her gave her notice for it which\nwas only to be expected.",
    "Did she ever talk to you much about what went on in the places she\nwas in\n\nMrs. Church shook her head.",
    "Not very much sir.",
    "More interested in\nher own doings she was.",
    "She was with Major and Mrs. Horton for a while wasnt she\n\nNearly a year sir.",
    "Why did she leave\n\nJust to better herself.",
    "There was a place going at the Manor and of\ncourse the wages was better there.",
    "Luke nodded.",
    "She was with the Hortons at the time of Mrs. Hortons\ndeath he asked.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "She grumbled a lot about that  with two hospital nurses in\nthe house and all that extra work nurses make and the trays and one\nthing and another.",
    "She wasnt with Mr. Abbot the lawyer at all\n\nNo sir.",
    "Mr. Abbot has a man and wife do for him.",
    "Amy did go to see\nhim once at his office but I dont know why.",
    "Luke stored away that small fact as possibly relevant.",
    "Since Mrs.\nChurch however clearly knew nothing more about it he did not\n\n\fpursue the subject.",
    "Any other gentlemen in the town who were\nfriends of hers\n\nNothing that Id care to repeat.",
    "Come now Mrs. Church.",
    "I want the truth remember.",
    "It wasnt a gentleman sir very far from it.",
    "Demeaning herself thats\nwhat it was and so I told her.",
    "Do you mind speaking more plainly Mrs. Church\n\nYoull have heard of the Seven Stars sir Not a goodclass house and\nthe landlord Harry Carter a lowclass fellow and half seas over most\nof the time.",
    "Amy was a friend of his\n\nShe went for a walk with him once or twice.",
    "I dont believe there was\nmore in it than that.",
    "I dont indeed sir.",
    "Luke nodded thoughtfully and changed the subject.",
    "Did you know a\nsmall boy Tommy Pierce\n\nWhat Mrs. Pierces son Of course I did.",
    "Always up to mischief.",
    "He ever see much of Amy\n\nOh no sir.",
    "Amy would soon send him off with a flea in his ear if he\ntried any of his tricks on her.",
    "Was she happy in her place with Miss Waynflete\n\nShe found it a bit dull sir and the pay wasnt high.",
    "But of course\nafter shed been dismissed the way she was from Ashe Manor it\nwasnt so easy to get another good place.",
    "She could have gone away I suppose\n\nTo London you mean\n\nOr some other part of the country\n\nMrs. Church shook her head.",
    "She said slowly Amy didnt want to\nleave Wychwood not as things were.",
    "How do you mean as things were\n\nWhat with Jim and the gentleman at the curio shop.",
    "Luke nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Mrs. Church went on Miss Waynflete is a\nvery nice lady but very particular about brass and silver and\neverything being dusted and the mattresses turned.",
    "Amy wouldnt\nhave put up with the fussing if she hadnt been enjoying herself in other\nways.",
    "I can imagine that said Luke dryly.",
    "He turned things over in his mind.",
    "He could see no further questions to ask.",
    "He was fairly certain that he\nhad extracted all that Mrs. Church knew.",
    "He decided on one last\ntentative attack I dare say you can guess the reason for all these\n\n\fquestions.",
    "The circumstances of Amys death were rather mysterious.",
    "Were not entirely satisfied as to its being an accident.",
    "If not you\nrealize what it must have been.",
    "Mrs. Church said with a certain ghoulish relief Foul play\n\nQuite so.",
    "Now supposing your niece did meet with foul play who do\nyou think is likely to be responsible for her death\n\nMrs. Church wiped her hands on her apron.",
    "Thered be a reward as\nlikely as not for setting the police on the right track she inquired\nmeaningly.",
    "There might be said Luke.",
    "I wouldnt like to say anything definite  Mrs. Church passed a hungry\ntongue over her thin lips  but the gentleman at the curio shop is a\nqueer one.",
    "Youll remember the Castor case sir and that poor girl.",
    "And thereve been five or six other poor girls served the same way\nlater.",
    "Maybe this Mr. Ellsworthy is one of that kind\n\nThats your suggestion is it\n\nWell it might be that way sir mightnt it\n\nLuke admitted that it might.",
    "Then he said Was Ellsworthy away from\nhere on the afternoon of Derby Day Thats a very important point.",
    "Mrs. Church stared.",
    "Derby Day\n\n\fYes a fortnight ago last Wednesday.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "Really I couldnt say as to that.",
    "He usually was\naway on Wednesdays went up to town as often as not.",
    "Its early\nclosing Wednesday you see.",
    "Oh said Luke early closing.",
    "He took his leave of Mrs. Church disregarding her insinuations that\nher time had been valuable and that she was therefore entitled to\nmonetary compensation.",
    "He found himself disliking Mrs. Church\nintensely.",
    "Nevertheless the conversation he had had with her though\nnot strikingly illuminative in any way had provided several suggestive\nsmall points.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nHe went over things carefully in his mind.",
    "Yes it still boiled down to\nthose four people  Thomas Abbot Horton and Ellsworthy.",
    "The\nattitude of Miss Waynflete seemed to him to prove that.",
    "Her distress\nand reluctance to mention a name.",
    "Surely that meant  that must mean\n that the person in question was someone of standing in Wychwood\nsomeone whom a chance insinuation might definitely injure.",
    "It tallied\ntoo with Miss Fullertons determination to take her suspicions to\nheadquarters.",
    "The local police would ridicule her theory.",
    "It was not a\ncase of the butcher the baker the candlestick maker.",
    "It was not a\ncase of a mere garage mechanic.",
    "The person in question was one\n\n\fagainst whom an accusation of murder was a fantastic and moreover\na serious matter.",
    "There were four possible candidates.",
    "It was up to\nhim to go carefully once more into the case against each one and\nmake up his own mind.",
    "First to examine the reluctance of Miss Waynflete.",
    "She was a\nconscientious and scrupulous person.",
    "She believed that she knew the\nman whom Miss Fullerton had suspected but it was as she had\npointed out only a belief on her part.",
    "It was possible that she was\nmistaken.",
    "Who was the person in Miss Waynfletes mind Miss\nWaynflete was distressed lest an accusation by her might injure an\ninnocent man.",
    "Therefore the object of her suspicions must be a man\nof high standing generally liked and respected by the community.",
    "Therefore Luke argued that automatically barred out Ellsworthy.",
    "He\nwas practically a stranger to Wychwood his local reputation was bad\nnot good.",
    "Luke did not believe that if Ellsworthy was the person in\nMiss Waynfletes mind she would have had any objection to\nmentioning him.",
    "Therefore as far as Miss Waynflete was concerned\nwash out Ellsworthy.",
    "Now as to the others.",
    "Luke believed that he could also eliminate Major\nHorton.",
    "Miss Waynflete had rebutted with some warmth the suggestion\nthat Horton might have poisoned his wife.",
    "If she had suspected him of\nlater crimes she would hardly have been so positive about his\ninnocence of the death of Mrs. Horton.",
    "That left Doctor Thomas and Mr. Abbot.",
    "Both of them fulfilled the\nnecessary requirements.",
    "They were men of high professional\nstanding against whom no word of scandal had ever been uttered.",
    "They were on the whole both popular and well liked and were known\nas men of integrity and rectitude.",
    "Luke proceeded to another aspect of the matter.",
    "Could he himself\neliminate Ellsworthy and Horton Immediately he shook his head.",
    "It\nwas not so simple.",
    "Miss Fullerton had known  really known  who the\nman was.",
    "That was proved in the first case by her own death and in\nthe second case by the death of Doctor Humbleby.",
    "But Miss Fullerton\nhad never actually mentioned a name to Honoria Waynflete.",
    "Therefore\nthough Miss Waynflete thought she knew she might quite easily be\nwrong.",
    "We often know what other people are thinking but sometimes\nwe find out that we did not know after all and have in fact made an\negregious mistake.",
    "Therefore the four candidates were still in the field.",
    "Miss Fullerton was\ndead and could give no further assistance.",
    "It was up to Luke to do\nwhat he had done before on the day after he came to Wychwood weigh up the evidence and consider the probabilities.",
    "He began with Ellsworthy.",
    "On the face of it Ellsworthy was the likeliest\nstarter.",
    "Lets take it this way said Luke to himself.",
    "Suspect everyone in\nturn.",
    "Ellsworthy for instance.",
    "Lets say hes the killer.",
    "For the moment\nlets take it quite definitely that I know that.",
    "Now well take the possible\nvictims in chronological order.",
    "First Mrs. Horton.",
    "Difficult to see what\nmotive Ellsworthy could have had for doing away with Mrs. Horton.",
    "But\nthere was a means.",
    "Horton spoke of some quack nostrum that she got\nfrom him and took.",
    "Some poison like arsenic could have been given\nthat way.",
    "The question is Why\n\n\fNow the others.",
    "Amy Gibbs.",
    "Why did Ellsworthy kill Amy Gibbs The\nobvious reason  she was being a nuisance.",
    "Threatened an action for\nbreach of promise perhaps Or had she assisted at a midnight orgy\nDid she threaten to talk Lord Easterfield has a good deal of influence\nin Wychwood and Lord Easterfield according to Bridget is a very\nmoral man.",
    "He might have taken up the matter against Ellsworthy if the\nlatter had been up to anything particularly objectionable.",
    "So exit Amy.",
    "Not I think a sadistic murder.",
    "The method employed is against that.",
    "Whos next Carter Why Carter Unlikely he would know about\nmidnight orgies  or did Amy tell him Was the pretty daughter mixed\nup in it Did Ellsworthy start making love to her Must have a look at\nLucy Carter.",
    "Perhaps he was just abusive to Ellsworthy and\nEllsworthy resented it.",
    "If hed already committed one or two murders\nhe would be getting sufficiently callous to contemplate a killing for a\nvery slight reason.",
    "Now Tommy Pierce.",
    "Why did Ellsworthy kill Tommy Pierce Easy.",
    "Tommy had assisted at a midnight ritual of some kind.",
    "Tommy\nthreatened to talk about it.",
    "Perhaps Tommy was talking about it.",
    "Shut\nTommys mouth.",
    "Doctor Humbleby.",
    "Why did Ellsworthy kill Doctor Humbleby Thats\nthe easiest of the lot.",
    "Humbleby was a doctor and hed noticed that\nEllsworthys mental balance was none too good.",
    "Probably was getting\nready to do something about it.",
    "So Humbleby was doomed.",
    "Theres a\nstumbling block there in the method.",
    "How did Ellsworthy insure that\nHumbleby should die of blood poisoning Or did Humbleby die of\nsomething else Was the poisoned finger a coincidence\n\n\fLast of all Miss Fullerton.",
    "Wednesdays early closing.",
    "Ellsworthy\nmight have gone up to town that day.",
    "Has he a car I wonder Never\nseen him in one but that proves nothing.",
    "He knew shed suspected\nhim and he was going to take no chances of Scotland Yard believing\nher story.",
    "Perhaps they already knew something about him then\n\nThats the case against Ellsworthy Now what is there for him Well\nfor one thing hes certainly not the man Miss Waynflete thought Miss\nFullerton meant.",
    "For another he doesnt fit  quite  with my own vague\nimpression.",
    "When she was talking I got a picture of a man  and it\nwasnt a man like Ellsworthy.",
    "The impression she gave me was of a\nvery ordinary man  outwardly that is  the kind of man nobody would\nsuspect.",
    "Ellsworthy is the kind of man you would suspect.",
    "No I got\nmore the impression of a man like  Doctor Thomas.",
    "Thomas now.",
    "What about Thomas I wiped him clean off the list after\nId had a chat with him.",
    "Nice unassuming fellow.",
    "But the whole point of\nthis murderer  unless Ive got the whole thing wrong  is that he would\nbe a nice unassuming fellow.",
    "The last person youd think ever would\nbe a murderer Which of course is exactly what one feels about\nThomas.",
    "Now then lets go through it again.",
    "Why did Doctor Thomas kill Amy\nGibbs Really it seems most unlikely that he did.",
    "But she did go to see\nhim that day and he did give her that bottle of cough mixture.",
    "Suppose\nthat was really oxalic acid.",
    "That would be very simple and clever.",
    "Who\nwas called in I wonder when she was found poisoned  Humbleby or\nThomas If it was Thomas he might just come along with an old bottle\nof hat paint in his pocket put it down unobtrusively on the table and\n\n\ftake off both bottles to be analyzed as bold as brass.",
    "Something like\nthat.",
    "It could be done if you were cool enough.",
    "Tommy Pierce Again I cant see a likely motive.",
    "Thats the difficulty\nwith our Doctor Thomas  motive.",
    "Theres not even a crazy motive.",
    "Same with Carter.",
    "Why should Doctor Thomas want to dispose of\nCarter One can only assume that Amy Tommy and the publican all\nknew something about Doctor Thomas that it was unhealthy to know.",
    "Ah supposing now that that something was the death of Mrs. Horton.",
    "Doctor Thomas attended her.",
    "And she died of a rather unexpected\nrelapse.",
    "He could have managed that easily enough.",
    "And Amy Gibbs\nremember was in the house at the time.",
    "She might have seen or heard\nsomething.",
    "That would account for her.",
    "Tommy Pierce we have it on\ngood authority was a particularly inquisitive small boy.",
    "He may have\ngot wise to something.",
    "Cant fit Carter in.",
    "Unless Amy Gibbs told him\nsomething.",
    "He may have repeated it in his cups and Thomas may have\ndecided to silence him too.",
    "All this of course is pure conjecture.",
    "But\nwhat else can one do\n\nNow Humbleby.",
    "Ah at last we come to a perfectly plausible murder.",
    "Adequate motive and ideal means.",
    "If Doctor Thomas couldnt give his\npartner blood poisoning no one could.",
    "He could reinfect the wound\nevery time he dressed it.",
    "I wish the earlier killings were a little more\nplausible.",
    "Miss Fullerton Shes more difficult but there is one definite fact.",
    "Doctor Thomas was not in Wychwood for at least a good part of the\nday.",
    "He gave out that he was attending a confinement.",
    "That may be.",
    "But the fact remains that he was away from Wychwood in a car.",
    "Is\nthere anything else Yes just one thing.",
    "The look he gave me when I\n\n\fwent away from the house the other day.",
    "Superior condescending the\nsmile of a man whod just led me up the garden path and knew it.",
    "Luke sighed shook his head and went on with his reasoning.",
    "Abbot\nHes the right kind of man too.",
    "Normal welltodo respected last sort\nof man and so on.",
    "Hes conceited too and confident.",
    "Murderers\nusually are.",
    "Theyve got overweening conceit.",
    "Always think theyll get\naway with it.",
    "Amy Gibbs paid him a visit once.",
    "Why What did she want\nto see him for To get legal advice Why Or was it a personal matter.",
    "Theres that mention of a letter from a lady that Tommy saw.",
    "Was that\nletter from Amy Gibbs Or was it a letter written by Mrs. Horton  a\nletter perhaps that Amy Gibbs had got hold of What other lady could\nthere be writing to Mr. Abbot on a matter so private that he loses\ncontrol when the office boy inadvertently sees it What else can we\nthink of re Amy Gibbs The hat paint Yes right kind of oldfashioned\ntouch  men like Abbot are usually well behind the times where women\nare concerned.",
    "The Old World style of philanderer.",
    "Tommy Pierce\nObvious on account of the letter  really it must have been a very\ndamning letter.",
    "Carter Well there was trouble about Carters\ndaughter.",
    "Abbot wasnt going to have a scandal  a lowdown ruffianly\nhalfwit like Carter dare to threaten him.",
    "He who had got away with two\nclever killings Away with Mr. Carter Dark night and a welldirected\npush.",
    "Really this killing business is almost too easy.",
    "Have I got the Abbot mentality I think so.",
    "Nasty look in an old ladys\neye.",
    "Shes thinking things about him.",
    "Then row with Humbleby.",
    "Old\nHumbleby daring to set himself against Abbot the clever solicitor and\nmurderer.",
    "The old fool  he little knows whats in store for him Hes for\nit Daring to browbeat me\n\n\fAnd then  what Turning to catch Lavinia Fullertons eyes.",
    "And his\nown eyes falter show a consciousness of guilt.",
    "He who was boasting\nof being unsuspected had definitely aroused suspicion.",
    "Miss Fullerton\nknows his secret.",
    "She knows what he has done.",
    "Yes but she cant\nhave proof.",
    "But suppose she goes about looking for it.",
    "Suppose she\ntalks.",
    "Suppose  Hes quite a shrewd judge of character.",
    "He guesses\nwhat she will finally do.",
    "If she goes with this tale of hers to Scotland\nYard they may believe her they may start making inquiries.",
    "Something pretty desperate has got to be done.",
    "Has Abbot got a car or\ndid he hire one in London Anyway he was away from here on Derby\nDay.",
    "Again Luke paused.",
    "He was so entering into the spirit of the thing that\nhe found it hard to make a transition from one suspect to another.",
    "He\nhad to wait a minute before he could force himself into the mood where\nhe could visualize Major Horton as a successful murderer.",
    "Horton murdered his wife.",
    "Lets start with that.",
    "He had ample\nprovocation and he gained considerably by her death.",
    "In order to carry\nit off successfully he had to make a good show of devotion.",
    "Hed had\nto keep that up.",
    "Sometimes shall we say he overdoes it a bit\n\nVery good one murder successfully accomplished.",
    "Whos the next\nAmy Gibbs.",
    "Yes perfectly credible.",
    "Amy was in the house.",
    "She may\nhave seen something  the Major administering a soothing cup of beef\ntea or gruel.",
    "She maynt have realized the point of what she saw till\nsome time later.",
    "The hatpaint trick is the sort of thing that would occur\nto the Major quite naturally  a very masculine man with little\nknowledge of womens fripperies.",
    "Amy Gibbs all serene and\naccounted for.",
    "The drunken Carter Same suggestion as before  Amy told him\nsomething.",
    "Another straightforward murder.",
    "Now Tommy Pierce.",
    "Weve got to fall back on his inquisitive nature.",
    "I\nsuppose the letter in Abbots office couldnt have been a complaint\nfrom Mrs. Horton that her husband was trying to poison her Thats\nonly a wild suggestion but it might be so.",
    "Anyway the Major becomes\nalive to the fact that Tommy is a menace so Tommy joins Amy and\nCarter.",
    "All quite simple and straightforward and according to Cocker.",
    "Easy to kill My God yes\n\nBut now we come to something rather difficult.",
    "Humbleby Motive\nVery obscure.",
    "Humbleby was attending Mrs. Horton originally.",
    "Did he\nget puzzled by the illness and did Horton influence his wife to change\nto the younger more unsuspicious doctor But if so what made\nHumbleby a danger so long after Difficult that.",
    "The manner of his\ndeath too.",
    "A poisoned finger.",
    "Doesnt connect up with the Major.",
    "Miss Fullerton Thats perfectly possible.",
    "He has a car.",
    "I saw it.",
    "And\nhe was away from Wychwood that day supposedly gone to the Derby.",
    "It might be yes.",
    "Is Horton a coldblooded killer Is he Is he I wish I\nknew\n\nLuke stared ahead of him.",
    "His brow was puckered with thought.",
    "Its\none of them.",
    "I dont think its Ellsworthy but it might be.",
    "Hes the most\nobvious one.",
    "Thomas is wildly unlikely  if it werent for the manner of\nHumblebys death.",
    "That blood poisoning definitely points to a medical\nmurderer.",
    "It could be Abbot theres not so much evidence against him\nas against the others but I can see him in the part somehow.",
    "Yes he\n\n\ffits as the others dont.",
    "And it could be Horton.",
    "Bullied by his wife for\nyears feeling his insignificance  yes it could be.",
    "But Miss Waynflete\ndoesnt think it is and shes no fool  and she knows the place and the\npeople in it.",
    "Which does she suspect.",
    "Abbot or Thomas It must be one of these\ntwo.",
    "If I tackled her outright  which of them is it  Id get it out of her\nthen perhaps.",
    "But even then she might be wrong.",
    "Theres no way of\nproving her right  like Miss Fullerton proved herself.",
    "More evidence thats what I want.",
    "If there were to be one more case  just one more then Id know.",
    "He stopped himself with a start.",
    "What Im asking for is another\nmurder he said under his breath.",
    "Chapter 16\n\nIn the bar of the Seven Stars Luke drank his pint and felt somewhat\nembarrassed.",
    "The stare of half a dozen bucolic pairs of eyes followed\nhis least movement and conversation had come to a standstill upon\nhis entrance.",
    "Luke essayed a few comments of general interest such as the crops\nthe state of the weather and football coupons but to none did he get\nany response.",
    "He was reduced to gallantry.",
    "The finelooking girl\nbehind the counter with her black hair and red cheeks he rightly\njudged to be Miss Lucy Carter.",
    "His advances were received in a\n\n\fpleasant spirit.",
    "Miss Carter duly giggled and said Go on with you Im\nsure you dont think nothing of the kind... Thats telling  and other\nsuch rejoinders.",
    "But the performance was clearly mechanical.",
    "Luke\nseeing no advantage to be gained by remaining finished his beer and\ndeparted.",
    "He walked along the path to where the river was spanned by a\nfootbridge.",
    "He was standing looking at this when a quavering voice\nbehind him said Thats it mister thats where old Harry went over.",
    "Luke turned to see one of his late fellow drinkers  one who had been\nparticularly unresponsive to the topic of crops weather and coupons.",
    "He was now clearly about to enjoy himself as a guide to the macabre.",
    "Went over into the mud he did said the ancient laborer.",
    "Right into\nthe mud and stuck in it head downward.",
    "Perhaps someone pushed him over said Luke making the\nsuggestion in a casual fashion.",
    "They might of the rustic agreed.",
    "But I dont know whod go for to do\nthat he added.",
    "He might have made a few enemies.",
    "He was fairly abusive when he\nwas drunk wasnt he\n\nHis language was a treat to hear.",
    "Didnt mince his words.",
    "Harry didnt.",
    "But no one would go for to push a man whats drunk.",
    "Luke did not combat this statement.",
    "It was evidently regarded as\nwildly unsporting for advantage to be taken of a mans state of\nintoxication.",
    "The rustic had sounded quite shocked at the idea.",
    "Well he said vaguely it was a sad business.",
    "None so sad for his missus said the old man.",
    "Reckon her and Lucy\nhavent no call to be sad about it.",
    "There may be other people who are glad to have him out of the way.",
    "The old man was vague about that.",
    "Maybe he said.",
    "But he didnt mean no harm.",
    "Harry didnt.",
    "On this\nepitaph for the late Mr. Carter they parted.",
    "Luke bent his steps toward the old Hall.",
    "The library transacted its\nbusiness in the two front rooms.",
    "Luke passed on to the back through a\ndoor which was labeled MUSEUM.",
    "There he moved from case to case\nstudying the notveryinspiring exhibits.",
    "Some Roman pottery and\ncoins.",
    "Some South Sea curiosities a Malay headdress.",
    "Various Indian\ngods presented by Major Horton together with a large and\nmalevolentlooking Buddha and a case of doubtfullooking Egyptian\nbeads.",
    "Luke wandered out again into the hall.",
    "There was no one about.",
    "He\nwent quietly up the stairs.",
    "There was a room with magazines and\npapers there and a room filled with nonfiction books.",
    "Luke went a\nstory higher.",
    "Here were rooms filled with what he designated himself as junk.",
    "Stuffed birds removed from the museum owing to the moths having\nattacked them stacks of torn magazines and a room whose shelves\n\n\fwere covered with outofdate works of fiction and childrens books.",
    "Luke approached the window.",
    "Here it must have been that Tommy\nPierce had sat possibly whistling and occasionally rubbing a pane of\nglass vigorously when he heard anyone coming.",
    "Somebody had come\nin.",
    "Tommy had shown his zeal sitting half out of the window and\npolishing with zest.",
    "And then that somebody had come up to him and\nwhile talking had given a sudden sharp push.",
    "Luke turned away.",
    "He walked down the stairs and stood a minute or\ntwo in the hall.",
    "Nobody had noticed him come in.",
    "Nobody had seen him go upstairs.",
    "Anyone might have done it said Luke.",
    "Easiest thing in the world.",
    "He heard footsteps coming from the direction of the library proper.",
    "Since he was an innocent man with no objection to being seen he\ncould remain where he was.",
    "If he had not wanted to be seen how easy\njust to step back inside the door of the museum room.",
    "Miss Waynflete came out from the library a little pile of books under\nher arm.",
    "She was pulling on her gloves.",
    "She looked happy and busy.",
    "When she saw him her face lit up and she exclaimed Oh Mr.\nFitzwilliam have you been looking at the museum Im afraid there\nisnt very much there really.",
    "Lord Easterfield is talking of getting us\nsome really interesting exhibits.",
    "Really\n\nYes something modern you know and uptodate.",
    "Like they have at\nthe Science Museum in London.",
    "He suggests a model aeroplane and a\nlocomotive and some chemical things too.",
    "That would perhaps brighten things up.",
    "Yes I dont think a museum should deal solely with the past do you\n\nPerhaps not.",
    "Then some food exhibits too  calories and vitamins  all that sort of\nthing.",
    "Lord Easterfield is so keen on the Greater Fitness Campaign.",
    "So he was saying the other night.",
    "Its the thing at present isnt it Lord Easterfield was telling me how\nhed been to the Wellerman Laboratories and seen such a lot of germs\nand cultures and bacteria it quite made me shiver.",
    "And he told me all\nabout mosquitoes and sleeping sickness and something about a liver\nfluke that Im afraid was a little too difficult for me.",
    "It was probably too difficult for Lord Easterfield said Luke\ncheerfully.",
    "Ill bet he got it all wrong.",
    "Youve got a much clearer brain\nthan he has Miss Waynflete.",
    "Miss Waynflete said sedately Thats very nice of you Mr. Fitzwilliam\nbut Im afraid women are never quite such deep thinkers as men.",
    "Luke repressed a desire to criticize adversely Lord Easterfields\nprocesses of thought.",
    "Instead he said I did look into the museum but\nafterwards I went up to have a look at the top windows.",
    "You mean where Tommy  Miss Waynflete shivered.",
    "Its really very\nhorrible.",
    "Yes its not a nice thought.",
    "Ive spent about an hour with Mrs. Church\n Amys aunt  not a nice woman.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I had to take rather a strong line with her said Luke.",
    "I fancy she\nthinks Im a kind of super policeman.",
    "He stopped as he noted a sudden change of expression on Miss\nWaynfletes face.",
    "Oh Mr. Fitzwilliam do you think that was wise\n\nLuke said I dont really know.",
    "I think it was inevitable.",
    "The book story\nwas wearing thin.",
    "I cant get much farther on that.",
    "I had to ask the kind\nof questions that were directly to the point.",
    "Miss Waynflete shook her head the troubled expression still on her\nface.",
    "In a place like this you see everything gets round so fast.",
    "You mean that everybody will say There goes the detective as I walk\ndown the street I dont think that really matters now.",
    "In fact I may get\nmore that way.",
    "I wasnt thinking of that.",
    "Miss Waynflete sounded a little breathless.",
    "What I meant was that hell know.",
    "Hell realize that youre on his\ntrack.",
    "Luke said slowly I suppose he will.",
    "Miss Waynflete said But dont you see thats horribly dangerous\nHorribly\n\nYou mean  Luke grasped her point at last  you mean that the killer\nwill have a crack at me\n\nYes.",
    "Funny said Luke.",
    "I never thought of that I believe youre right\nthough.",
    "Well that might be the best thing that could happen.",
    "Miss Waynflete said earnestly I dont think you realize that hes  hes\na very clever man.",
    "Hes cautious too.",
    "And remember hes got a great\ndeal of experience  perhaps more than we know.",
    "Yes said Luke thoughtfully thats probably true.",
    "Miss Waynflete exclaimed Oh I dont like it Really I feel quite\nalarmed\n\nLuke said gently You neednt worry.",
    "I shall be very much on my\nguard I can assure you.",
    "You see Ive narrowed the possibilities down\npretty closely.",
    "Ive an idea at any rate who the killer might be.",
    "She\nlooked up sharply.",
    "Luke came a step nearer.",
    "He lowered his voice to a\nwhisper.",
    "Miss Waynflete if I were to ask you which of two men you\nconsidered the most likely  Doctor Thomas or Mr. Abbot  what would\nyou say\n\n\fOh said Miss Waynflete.",
    "Her hand flew to her breast.",
    "She stepped\nback.",
    "Her eyes met Lukes in an expression that puzzled him.",
    "They\nshowed impatience and something closely allied to it that he could not\nquite place.",
    "She said I cant say anything.",
    "She turned away abruptly with a curious sound  half a sigh half a\nsob.",
    "Luke resigned himself.",
    "Are you going home he asked.",
    "No.",
    "I was going to take these books to Mrs. Humbleby.",
    "That lies on\nyour way back to the Manor.",
    "We might go part of the way together.",
    "That will be very nice said Luke.",
    "They went down the steps turned to the left skirting the village green.",
    "Luke looked back at the Stately lines of the house they had left.",
    "It\nmust have been a lovely house in your fathers day he said.",
    "Miss Waynflete sighed.",
    "Yes we were all very happy there.",
    "I am so\nthankful it hasnt been pulled down.",
    "So many of the old houses are\ngoing.",
    "I know.",
    "Its sad.",
    "And really the new ones arent nearly so well built.",
    "I doubt if they will stand the test of time as well.",
    "But of course said Miss Waynflete the new ones are convenient so laborsaving and not such big drafty passages to scrub.",
    "Luke assented.",
    "When they arrived at the gate of Doctor Humblebys\nhouse Miss Waynflete hesitated and said Such a beautiful evening.",
    "I\nthink if you dont mind I will come a little farther.",
    "I am enjoying the\nair.",
    "Somewhat surprised Luke expressed pleasure politely.",
    "It was hardly\nwhat he would have described as a beautiful evening.",
    "There was a\nstrong wind blowing turning back the leaves viciously on the trees.",
    "A\nstorm he thought might come at any minute.",
    "Miss Waynflete\nhowever clutching her hat with one hand walked by his side with\nevery appearance of enjoyment talking as she went in little gasps.",
    "It was a somewhat lonely lane they were taking since from Doctor\nHumblebys house the shortest way to Ashe Manor was not by the main\nroad but by a side lane which led to one of the back gates of the manor\nhouse.",
    "This gate was not of the same ornate ironwork but had two\nhandsome gate pillars surmounted by two vast pink pineapples.",
    "Why\npineapples Luke had been unable to discover.",
    "But he gathered that to\nLord Easterfield pineapples spelt distinction and good taste.",
    "As they\napproached the gate the sound of voices raised in anger came to\nthem.",
    "A moment later they came in sight of Lord Easterfield\nconfronting a young man in chauffeurs uniform.",
    "Youre fired Lord Easterfield was shouting.",
    "Dyou hear Youre\nfired\n\nIf youd overlook it mlord just this once.",
    "No I wont overlook it Taking my car out My car And whats more\nyouve been drinking...",
    "Yes you have dont deny it Ive made it clear\nthere are three things I wont have on my estate  ones drunkenness\nanothers immorality and the lasts impertinence\n\nThough the man was not actually drunk he had had enough to loosen\nhis tongue.",
    "His manner changed.",
    "You wont have this and you wont\nhave that you old buzzard Your estate Think we dont all know your\nfather kept a boot shop down here Makes us laugh ourselves sick it\ndoes seeing you strutting about as cock of the walk Who are you Id\nlike to know Youre no better than I am thats what you are\n\nLord Easterfield turned purple.",
    "How dare you speak to me like that\nHow dare you\n\nThe young man took a threatening step forward.",
    "If you wasnt such a\nmiserable potbellied little swine Id give you a sock on the jaw  yes I\nwould.",
    "Lord Easterfield hastily retreated a step tripped over a root and went\ndown in a sitting position.",
    "Luke had come up.",
    "Get out of here he said\nroughly to the chauffeur.",
    "The latter regained sanity.",
    "He looked frightened.",
    "Im sorry sir.",
    "I dont\nknow what came over me Im sure.",
    "A couple of glasses too much I should say said Luke.",
    "He assisted\nLord Easterfield to his feet.",
    "Im sorry mlord stammered the man.",
    "Youll be sorry for this Rivers said Lord Easterfield.",
    "His voice\ntrembled with intense feeling.",
    "The man hesitated a minute then\nshambled\n\naway\n\nslowly.",
    "Lord\n\nEasterfield\n\nexploded\n\nColossal\n\nimpertinence To me Speaking to me like that Something very serious\nwill happen to that man No respect no proper sense of his station in\nlife.",
    "When I think of what I do for these people  good wages every\ncomfort a pension when they retire.",
    "The ingratitude  the base\ningratitude\n\nHe choked with excitement then perceived Miss Waynflete who was\nstanding silently by.",
    "Is that you Honoria Im deeply distressed that\nyou should have witnessed such a disgraceful scene.",
    "That mans\nlanguage \n\nIm afraid he wasnt quite himself Lord Easterfield said Miss\nWaynflete primly.",
    "He was drunk thats what he was  drunk\n\nJust a bit lit up said Luke.",
    "Do you know what he did Lord Easterfield looked from one to the\nother of them.",
    "Took out my car  my car Thought I shouldnt be back\nso soon.",
    "Bridget drove me over to Lyne in the twoseater.",
    "And this\nfellow had the impertinence to take a girl  Lucy Carter I believe  out\nin my car\n\nMiss Waynflete said gently A most improper thing to do.",
    "Lord Easterfield seemed a little comforted.",
    "Yes wasnt it\n\nBut Im sure hell regret it.",
    "I shall see that he does.",
    "Youve dismissed him Miss Waynflete pointed out.",
    "Lord Easterfield shook his head.",
    "Hell come to a bad end that fellow.",
    "He threw back his shoulders.",
    "Come up to the house Honoria and\nhave a glass of sherry.",
    "Thank you Lord Easterfield but I must go to Mrs. Humbleby with\nthese books... Good night Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "Youll be quite all right now.",
    "She gave him a smiling nod and walked briskly away.",
    "It was so much\nthe attitude of a nurse who delivers a child at a party that Luke caught\nhis breath as a sudden idea struck him.",
    "Was it possible that Miss\nWaynflete had accompanied him solely in order to protect him The\nidea seemed ridiculous but...\n\nLord Easterfields voice interrupted his meditations.",
    "Very capable\nwoman Honoria Waynflete.",
    "Very I should think.",
    "Lord Easterfield began to walk toward the house.",
    "He moved rather\nstiffly and his hand went to his posterior and rubbed it gingerly.",
    "Suddenly he chuckled.",
    "I was engaged to Honoria once years ago.",
    "She was a nicelooking girl  not so skinny as she is today.",
    "Seems\nfunny to think of now.",
    "Her people were the nobs of this place.",
    "Yes\n\nLord Easterfield ruminated.",
    "Old Colonel Waynflete bossed the show.",
    "One had to come out and touch ones cap pretty sharp.",
    "One of the old\nschool he was and proud as Lucifer.",
    "He chuckled again.",
    "The fat was\nin the fire all right when Honoria announced she was going to marry\nme Called herself a radical she did.",
    "Very earnest.",
    "Was all for\nabolishing class distinctions.",
    "She was a serious kind of girl.",
    "So her family broke up the romance\n\nLord Easterfield rubbed his nose.",
    "Well not exactly.",
    "Matter of fact we\nhad a bit of a row over something.",
    "Blinking bird she had  one of those\nbeastly twittering canaries always hated them  bad business  wrung\nits neck.",
    "Well no good dwelling on all that now.",
    "Lets forget it.",
    "He\nshook his shoulders like a man who throws off an unpleasant memory.",
    "Then he said rather jerkily Dont think shes ever forgiven me.",
    "Well\nperhaps its only natural.",
    "I think shes forgiven you all right said Luke.",
    "Lord Easterfield brightened up.",
    "Do you Glad of that.",
    "You know I\nrespect Honoria.",
    "Capable woman and a lady That still counts even in\nthese days.",
    "She runs that library business very well.",
    "He looked up\nand his voice changed.",
    "Hullo he said.",
    "Here comes Bridget.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nLuke felt a tightening of his muscles as Bridget approached.",
    "He had\nhad no word alone with her since the day of the tennis party.",
    "By mutual\nconsent they had avoided each other.",
    "He stole a glance at her now.",
    "She looked provokingly calm cool and indifferent.",
    "She said lightly I\nwas beginning to wonder what on earth had become of you Gordon.",
    "Lord Easterfield grunted.",
    "Had a bit of a dustup That fellow.",
    "Rivers\nhad the impertinence to take the Rolls out this afternoon.",
    "Lesemajeste said Bridget.",
    "Its no good making a joke out of it Bridget.",
    "The things serious.",
    "He\ntook a girl out.",
    "I dont suppose it would have given him any pleasure to go solemnly\nfor a drive by himself.",
    "Lord Easterfield drew himself up.",
    "On my estate Ill have decent moral\nbehavior.",
    "It isnt actually immoral to take a girl joy riding.",
    "It is when its my car.",
    "That of course is worse than immorality It practically amounts to\nblasphemy.",
    "But you cant cut out the sex stuff altogether Gordon.",
    "The\nmoon is at the full and its actually Midsummer Eve.",
    "Is it by Jove said Luke.",
    "Bridget threw him a glance.",
    "That seems to interest you\n\nIt does.",
    "Bridget turned back to Lord Easterfield.",
    "Three extraordinary people have arrived at the Bells and Motley.",
    "Item\none a man with shorts spectacles and a lovely plumcolored silk shirt\nItem two a female with no eyebrows dressed in a peplum a pound of\nassorted sham Egyptian beads and sandals.",
    "Item three a fat man in a\nlavender suit and corespondent shoes.",
    "I suspect them of being\nfriends of our Mr. Ellsworthy.",
    "Says the gossip writer Someone has\nwhispered that there will be gay doings in the Witches Meadow\ntonight.",
    "Lord Easterfield turned purple and said I wont have it\n\nYou cant help it darling.",
    "The Witches Meadow is public property.",
    "I wont have this irreligious mumbo jumbo going on down here Ill\nexpose it in Scandals.",
    "He paused then said Remind me to make a\nnote about that and get Siddely on to it.",
    "I must go up to town\ntomorrow.",
    "Lord Easterfields campaign against witchcraft said Bridget\nflippantly.",
    "Medieval superstitions still rife in quiet country village.",
    "Lord Easterfield stared at her with a puzzled frown then he turned and\nwent into the house.",
    "Luke said pleasantly You must do your stuff better than that\nBridget.",
    "What do you mean\n\nIt would be a pity if you lost your job.",
    "That hundred thousand isnt\nyours yet.",
    "Nor are the diamonds and pearls.",
    "I should wait until after the\nmarriage ceremony to exercise your sarcastic gifts if I were you.",
    "Her glance met his coolly.",
    "You are so thoughtful dear Luke.",
    "Its kind\nof you to take my future so much to heart.",
    "Kindness and consideration have always been my strong points.",
    "I hadnt noticed it.",
    "No You surprise me.",
    "Bridget twitched the leaf off a creeper.",
    "She said What have you been\ndoing today\n\nThe usual spot of sleuthing.",
    "Any results\n\n\fYes and no as the politicians say.",
    "By the way have you got any tools\nin the house\n\nI expect so.",
    "What kind of tools\n\nOh any handy little gadgets.",
    "Perhaps I could inspect same.",
    "Ten\nminutes later Luke had made his selection from a cupboard shelf.",
    "That little lot will do nicely he said slapping the pocket in which he\nhad stowed them away.",
    "Are you thinking of doing a spot of forcing and entering\n\nMaybe.",
    "Youre very uncommunicative on the subject.",
    "Well after all the situation bristles with difficulties.",
    "Im in the hell of a\nposition.",
    "After our little dustup on Saturday I suppose I ought to clear\nout of here.",
    "To behave as a perfect gentleman you should.",
    "But since Im convinced that I am pretty hot on the trail of a homicidal\nmaniac Im more or less forced to remain.",
    "If you could think of any\nconvincing reason for me to leave here and take up my quarters at the\nBells and Motley for goodness sake trot it out.",
    "Bridget shook her head.",
    "Thats not feasible  you being a cousin and\nall that.",
    "Besides the inn is full of Mr. Ellsworthys friends.",
    "They only run\nto three guest rooms.",
    "So I am forced to remain painful as it must be for you.",
    "Bridget smiled sweetly at him.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I can always do with a few\nscalps to dangle.",
    "That said Luke appreciatively was a particularly dirty crack.",
    "What\nI admire about you Bridget is that you have practically no instincts of\nkindliness.",
    "Well well.",
    "The rejected lover will now go and change for\ndinner.",
    "The evening passed uneventfully.",
    "Luke won Lord Easterfields\napproval even more deeply than before by the apparent absorbed\ninterest with which he listened to the others nightly discourse.",
    "When\nthey came into the drawing room Bridget said You men have been a\nlong time.",
    "Luke replied Lord Easterfield was being so interesting that the time\npassed like a flash.",
    "He was telling me how he founded his first\nnewspaper.",
    "Mrs. Anstruther said These new little fruiting trees in pots are\nperfectly marvelous I believe.",
    "You ought to try them along the terrace\nGordon.",
    "The conversation then proceeded on normal lines.",
    "Luke retired early.",
    "He did not however go to bed.",
    "He had other plans.",
    "It was just striking twelve when he descended the stairs noiselessly in\n\n\ftennis shoes passed through the library and let himself out by a\nwindow.",
    "The wind was still blowing in violent gusts interspersed with brief lulls.",
    "Clouds scudded across the sky obliterating the moon so that\ndarkness alternated with bright moonlight.",
    "Luke made his way by a circuitous route to Mr. Ellsworthys\nestablishment.",
    "He saw his way clear to doing a little investigation.",
    "He\nwas fairly certain that Mr. Ellsworthy and his friends would be out\ntogether on this particular date.",
    "Midsummer Eve Luke thought was\nsure to be marked by some ceremony or other.",
    "Whilst this was in\nprogress it would be a good opportunity to search Mr. Ellsworthys\nhouse.",
    "He climbed a couple of walls got round to the back of the house took\nthe assorted tools from his pocket and selected a likely implement.",
    "He found a scullery window amenable to his efforts.",
    "A few minutes\nlater he had slipped back the catch raised the sash and hoisted\nhimself over.",
    "He had a torch in his pocket.",
    "He used it sparingly  a brief\nflash just to show him his way and to avoid running into things.",
    "In a quarter of an hour he had satisfied himself that the house was\nempty.",
    "The owner was out and abroad on his own affairs.",
    "Luke smiled\nwith satisfaction and settled down to his task.",
    "He made a minute and\nthorough search of every available nook and corner.",
    "In a locked\ndrawer below two or three innocuous watercolor sketches he came\nupon some artistic efforts which caused him to lift his eyebrows and\nwhistle.",
    "Mr. Ellsworthys correspondence was unilluminating but\n\n\fsome of his books  those tucked away at the back of a cupboard repaid attention.",
    "Besides these Luke accumulated three meager but\nsuggestive scraps of information.",
    "The first was a pencil scrawl in a\nlittle notebook Settle with Tommy Pierce  the date being a couple of\ndays before the boys death.",
    "The second was a crayon sketch of Amy\nGibbs with a furious red cross right across the face.",
    "The third was a\nbottle of cough mixture.",
    "None of these things was in any way\nconclusive but taken together they might be considered as\nencouraging.",
    "Luke was just restoring some final order replacing things in their\nplace when he suddenly stiffened and switched off his torch.",
    "He had\nheard the key inserted in the lock of a side door.",
    "He stepped across to\nthe door of the room he was in and applied an eye to a crack.",
    "He hoped\nEllsworthy  if it was he  would go straight upstairs.",
    "The side door opened and Ellsworthy stepped in switching on a hall\nlight as he did so.",
    "As he passed along the hall Luke saw his face and\ncaught his breath.",
    "It was unrecognizable.",
    "The eyes were alight with a\nstrange mad exultation but what caused Luke to catch his breath was\nthe sight of Ellsworthys hands.",
    "They were stained a deep brownish\nred the color of dried blood.",
    "He disappeared up the stairs.",
    "A moment\nlater the light in the hall was extinguished.",
    "Luke waited a little longer then very cautiously he crept out into the\nhall made his way to the scullery and left by the window.",
    "He looked up\nat the house but it was dark and silent.",
    "He drew a deep breath.",
    "The\nfellows mad all right he said.",
    "I wonder what hes been up to Ill\nswear that was blood on his hands\n\n\fHe made a detour round the village and returned to Ashe Manor by a\nroundabout route.",
    "It was as he was turning into the side lane that a\nsudden rustle of leaves wrapped in a dark cloak came out from the\nshadow of a tree.",
    "It looked so eerie that Luke felt his heart miss a beat.",
    "Then he recognized the long pale face under the hood.",
    "Bridget How\nyou startled me\n\nShe said sharply Where have you been I saw you go out.",
    "And you followed me\n\nNo.",
    "Youd gone too far.",
    "Ive been waiting till you came back.",
    "That was a silly thing to do Luke grumbled.",
    "She repeated her question impatiently Where have you been\n\nLuke said gaily Raiding our Mr. Ellsworthy.",
    "Bridget caught her breath.",
    "Did you  find anything\n\nI dont know.",
    "I know a bit more about the swines tastes and all that and there are three things that might be suggestive.",
    "She listened attentively as he recounted the result of his search.",
    "Its\nvery slight evidence though he ended.",
    "But Bridget just as I was\nleaving Ellsworthy came back.",
    "And I tell you this  the mans as mad as\na hatter\n\nYou really think so\n\n\fI saw his face It was  unspeakable God knows what hed been up to\nHe was in a delirium of mad excitement.",
    "And his hands were stained\nIll swear with blood.",
    "Bridget shivered.",
    "Horrible she murmured.",
    "Luke said irritably You shouldnt have come out by yourself Bridget.",
    "It was absolute madness.",
    "Somebody might have knocked you on the\nhead.",
    "She laughed shakily.",
    "The same applies to you my dear.",
    "I can look after myself.",
    "Im pretty good at taking care of myself too.",
    "Hardboiled I should\nthink youd call me.",
    "A sharp gust of wind came.",
    "Luke said suddenly Take off that hood\nthing.",
    "Why\n\nWith an unexpected movement he snatched at her cloak and whipped\nit away.",
    "The wind caught her hair and blew it out straight up from her\nhead.",
    "She stared at him her breath coming fast.",
    "Luke said You\ncertainly are incomplete without a broomstick Bridget.",
    "Thats how I\nsaw you first.",
    "He stared a minute longer and said Youre a cruel devil.",
    "With a\nsharp impatient sigh he tossed the cloak back to her.",
    "There put it on.",
    "Lets go home.",
    "Wait.",
    "Why\n\nShe came up to him.",
    "She spoke in a low rather breathless voice.",
    "Because Ive got something to say to you.",
    "Thats partly why I waited\nfor you here outside the Manor.",
    "I want to say it to you now before we\ngo inside into Gordons property.",
    "Well\n\nShe gave a short rather bitter laugh.",
    "Oh its quite simple.",
    "You win\nLuke.",
    "Thats all.",
    "He said sharply What do you mean\n\nI mean that Ive given up the idea of being Lady Easterfield.",
    "He took a step nearer.",
    "Is that true he demanded.",
    "Yes Luke.",
    "Youll marry me\n\nYes.",
    "Why I wonder.",
    "I dont know.",
    "You say such beastly things to me and I seem to like it.",
    "He took her in his arms and kissed her.",
    "He said Its a mad world.",
    "Are you happy Luke\n\nNot particularly.",
    "Do you think youll ever be happy with me\n\nI dont know.",
    "Ill risk it.",
    "Yes thats what I feel.",
    "He slipped his arm through hers.",
    "Were rather queer about all this my\nsweet.",
    "Come along.",
    "Perhaps we shall be more normal in the morning.",
    "Yes.",
    "Its rather frightening the way things happen to one.",
    "She looked\ndown and tugged him to a standstill.",
    "Luke  Luke whats that\n\nThe moon had come out from the clouds.",
    "Luke looked down to where\nBridgets shoe trembled by a huddled mass.",
    "With a startled\nexclamation he dragged his arm free and knelt down.",
    "He looked from\nthe shapeless heap to the gatepost above.",
    "The pineapple was gone.",
    "He stood up at last.",
    "Bridget was standing her hands pressed together\non her mouth.",
    "He said Its the chauffeur  Rivers.",
    "Hes dead.",
    "That beastly stone thing  its been loose for some time.",
    "I suppose it\nblew down on him.",
    "Luke shook his head.",
    "The wind wouldnt do a thing like that.",
    "Oh thats\nwhat its meant to look like that is what its meant to be  another\naccident But its a fake.",
    "Its the killer again.",
    "No no Luke\n\nI tell you it is.",
    "Do you know what I felt on the back of his head in with\nthe stickiness and mess  grains of sand.",
    "Theres no sand about here.",
    "I\ntell you Bridget somebody stood here and slugged him as he came\nthrough the gate back to his cottage.",
    "Then they laid him down and\nrolled that pineapple thing down on top of him.",
    "Bridget said faintly Luke theres blood  on your hands\n\nLuke said grimly There was blood on someone elses hands.",
    "Do you\nknow what I was thinking this afternoon That if there were to be one\nmore crime wed surely know.",
    "And we do know Ellsworthy He was\nout tonight and he came in with blood on his hands capering and\nprancing and mad  drunk with the homicidal maniacs exultation.",
    "Looking down Bridget shivered and said in a low voice Poor Rivers.",
    "Luke said pityingly Yes poor fellow.",
    "Its damnable bad luck.",
    "But this\nwill be the last Bridget Now we know well get him\n\n\fHe saw her sway and in two steps he had caught her in his arms.",
    "She\nsaid in a small childlike voice Luke Im frightened.",
    "He said Its all over darling.",
    "Its all over.",
    "She murmured Be kind to me please.",
    "Ive been hurt so much.",
    "He said Weve hurt each other.",
    "We wont do that any more.",
    "Chapter 18\n\nDoctor Thomas stared across his consultingroom desk at Luke.",
    "Remarkable he said.",
    "Remarkable You are really serious Mr.\nFitzwilliam\n\nAbsolutely.",
    "I am convinced that Ellsworthy is a dangerous maniac.",
    "I have not paid special attention to the man.",
    "I should say though that\nhe is possibly an abnormal type.",
    "Id go a good deal farther than that said Luke grimly.",
    "You seriously believe that this man.",
    "Rivers was murdered\n\nI do.",
    "You noticed the grains of sand in the wound\n\n\fDoctor Thomas nodded.",
    "I looked out for them after your statement.",
    "I\nam bound to say that you were correct.",
    "That makes it clear does it not that the accident was faked and that\nthe man was killed by a blow from a sandbag or at any rate was\nstunned by one\n\nNot necessarily.",
    "What do you mean\n\nDoctor Thomas leaned back and joined his finger tips together.",
    "Supposing that this man Rivers had been lying out in a sand pit during\nthe day  there are several about in this part of the world.",
    "That might\naccount for grains of sand in the hair.",
    "Man I tell you he was murdered\n\nYou may tell me so said Doctor Thomas dryly but that doesnt\nmake it a fact.",
    "Luke controlled his exasperation.",
    "I suppose you dont believe a word\nof what Im telling you.",
    "Doctor Thomas smiled a kindly superior smile.",
    "You must admit Mr.\nFitzwilliam that its rather a wild story.",
    "You assert that this man\nEllsworthy has killed a servant girl a small boy a drunken publican\nmy own partner and finally this man Rivers.",
    "You dont believe it\n\n\fDoctor Thomas shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I have some knowledge of Humblebys case.",
    "It seems to me quite out\nof the question that Ellsworthy could have caused his death and I\nreally cannot see that you have any evidence at all that he did so.",
    "I dont know how he managed it confessed Luke but it all hangs\ntogether with Miss Fullertons story.",
    "There again you assert that Ellsworthy followed her up to London and\nran her down in a car.",
    "Again you havent a shadow of proof that\nhappened Its all  well romancing\n\nLuke said sharply Now that I know where I am it will be my business\nto get proofs.",
    "Im going up to London tomorrow to see an old pal of\nmine.",
    "I saw in the paper two days ago that hes been made assistant\ncommissioner.",
    "He knows me and hell listen to what I have to say.",
    "One\nthing Im sure of.",
    "Hell order a thorough investigation of the whole\nbusiness.",
    "Doctor Thomas stroked his chin thoughtfully.",
    "Well no doubt that should be very satisfactory.",
    "If it turns out that\nyoure mistaken \n\nLuke interrupted him You definitely dont believe a word of all this\n\nIn wholesale murder Doctor Thomas raised his eyebrows.",
    "Quite\nfrankly Mr. Fitzwilliam I dont.",
    "The thing is too fantastic.",
    "Fantastic perhaps but it hangs together.",
    "Youve got to admit it hangs\ntogether.",
    "Once you accept Miss Fullertons story as true.",
    "Doctor Thomas was shaking his head.",
    "A slight smile came to his lips.",
    "If you knew some of these old maids as well as I do  he murmured.",
    "Luke rose trying to control his annoyance.",
    "At any rate youre well named he said.",
    "A doubting Thomas if there\never was one\n\nThomas replied goodhumoredly.",
    "Give me a few proofs my dear\nfellow.",
    "Thats all I ask.",
    "Not just a long melodramatic rigmarole based\non what an old lady fancied she saw.",
    "What old ladies fancy they see is very often right.",
    "My Aunt Mildred\nwas positively uncanny Have you got any aunts yourself Thomas\n\nWell  er  no.",
    "A mistake said Luke.",
    "Every man should have aunts.",
    "They illustrate\nthe triumph of guesswork over logic.",
    "It is reserved for aunts to know\nthat Mr. A is a rogue because he looks like a dishonest butler they\nonce had.",
    "Other people say reasonably enough that a respectable\nman like Mr. A couldnt be a crook.",
    "The old ladies are right every time.",
    "Doctor Thomas smiled his superior smile again.",
    "Luke said his\nexasperation mounting once more Dont you realize that Im a\npoliceman myself Im not the complete amateur.",
    "Doctor Thomas smiled and murmured In the Mayang Straits.",
    "Crime is crime even in the Mayang Straits.",
    "Of course  of course.",
    "Luke left Doctor Thomas surgery in a state of suppressed irritation.",
    "He joined Bridget who said Well how did you get on\n\nHe didnt believe me said Luke.",
    "Which when you come to think of\nit is hardly surprising.",
    "Its a wild story with no proofs.",
    "Doctor Thomas\nis emphatically not the sort of man who believes six impossible things\nbefore breakfast.",
    "Will anybody believe you\n\nProbably not but when I get hold of old Billy Bones tomorrow the\nwheels will start turning.",
    "Theyll check up on our longhaired friend\nEllsworthy and in the end theyre bound to get somewhere.",
    "Bridget said thoughtfully Were coming out into the open very much\narent we\n\nWeve got to.",
    "We cant  we simply cant afford any more murders.",
    "Bridget shivered.",
    "Do be careful Luke.",
    "Im being careful all right.",
    "Dont walk near gates with pineapples on\nthem avoid the lonely woods at nightfall watch out for your food and\ndrink.",
    "I know all the ropes.",
    "Its horrible feeling youre a marked man.",
    "So long as youre not a marked woman my sweet.",
    "Perhaps I am.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "But I dont intend to take risks.",
    "Im watching over you\nlike an oldfashioned guardian angel.",
    "Is it any good saying anything to the police here Luke considered.",
    "No I dont think it is.",
    "Better go straight to Scotland Yard.",
    "Bridget murmured Thats what Miss Fullerton thought.",
    "Yes but I shall be watching out for trouble.",
    "Bridget said I know what Im going to do tomorrow.",
    "I shall march\nGordon down to that brutes shop and make him buy things.",
    "Thereby insuring that our Mr. Ellsworthy is not lying in ambush for me\non the steps of Whitehall\n\nThats the idea.",
    "Luke said with some slight embarrassment About Easterfield.",
    "Bridget said quickly Lets leave it till you come back tomorrow.",
    "Then\nwell have it out.",
    "Will he be very cut up do you think\n\nWell  Bridget considered the question  hell be annoyed.",
    "Annoyed Ye gods Isnt that putting it a bit mildly\n\nNo.",
    "Because you see Gordon doesnt like being annoyed.",
    "It upsets\nhim.",
    "Luke said soberly I feel rather uncomfortable about it all.",
    "That feeling was uppermost in his mind when he prepared that evening\nto listen for the twentieth time to Lord Easterfield on the subject of\nLord Easterfield.",
    "It was he admitted a cads trick to stay in a mans\nhouse and steal his fianc\u00e9e.",
    "He still felt however that a potbellied\npompous strutting little nincompoop like Lord Easterfield ought never\nto have aspired to Bridget at all.",
    "But his conscience so far chastened\nhim that he listened with an extra dose of fervent attention and in\nconsequence made a thoroughly favorable impression on his host.",
    "Lord Easterfield was in high good humor this evening.",
    "The death of his erstwhile chauffeur seemed to have exhilarated rather\nthan depressed him.",

    "Its always the way sir.",
    "The man sighed.",
    "Half the witnesses have\ndisappeared before a constable can get there and take down\nparticulars.",

    "Its rather a personal\none but I think you will forgive me for asking it.",
    "Please ask me anything you like.",
    "I am quite sure your reason for doing\nso will be a good one.",
    "Thank you.",
    "He paused.",
    "I want to know exactly why you broke off\nyour engagement to Lord Easterfield all those years ago\n\nShe had not expected that.",
    "The color rose in her cheeks and one hand\nwent to her breast.",
    "Has he told you anything\n\nLuke replied He told me there was something about a bird  a bird\nwhose neck was wrung.",
    "He said that Her voice was wondering.",
    "He admitted it Thats\nextraordinary\n\nWill you tell me please\n\nYes I will tell you.",
    "But I beg that you will never speak of the matter to\nhim  to Gordon.",
    "It is all past  all over and finished with.",
    "I dont want it raked up.",
    "She looked at him appealingly.",
    "Luke nodded.",
    "It is only for my personal satisfaction he said.",
    "I shall\nnot repeat what you tell me.",
    "Thank you.",
    "She had recovered her composure.",
    "Her voice was quite\nsteady as she went on It was like this I had a little canary.",
    "I was very\nfond of it and perhaps rather silly about it  girls were then.",
    "They\nwere rather  well coy about their pets.",
    "It must have been irritating to\na man  I do realize that.",
    "Yes said Luke as she paused.",
    "Gordon was jealous of the bird.",
    "He said one day quite illtemperedly\nI believe you prefer that bird to me.",
    "And I in the rather silly way girls\nwent on in those days laughed and held it up on my finger saying\nsomething like Of course I love you dicky bird better than a great\nsilly boy Of course I do Then  oh it was frightening  Gordon\nsnatched the bird from me and wrung its neck.",
    "It was such a shock.",
    "I\nshall never forget it Her face had gone very pale.",
    "And so you broke off the engagement said Luke.",
    "Yes.",
    "I couldnt feel the same afterwards  she hesitated  it wasnt\njust the action  that might have been done in a fit of jealousy and\ntemper  it was the awful feeling I had that hed enjoyed doing it.",
    "It was\nthat that frightened me\n\nEven long ago murmured Luke.",
    "Even in those days.",
    "She laid a hand on his arm.",
    "Mr. Fitzwilliam \n\n\fHe met the frightened appeal in her eyes with a grave steady look.",
    "It\nis Lord Easterfield who has committed all those murders he said.",
    "Youve known that all along havent you\n\nShe shook her head with vigor.",
    "Not known it If I had known it then then of course I would have spoken out.",
    "No it was just a fear.",
    "And yet you never gave me a hint\n\nShe clasped her hands in a sudden anguish.",
    "How could I How could I I was fond of him once.",
    "Yes said Luke gently.",
    "I see.",
    "She turned away fumbled in her bag and a small laceedged\nhandkerchief was pressed for a moment to her eyes.",
    "Then she turned\nback again dryeyed dignified and composed.",
    "I am so glad she said that Bridget has broken off her engagement.",
    "She is going to marry you instead is she not\n\nYes.",
    "That will be much more suitable said Miss Waynflete rather primly.",
    "Luke was unable to help smiling a little.",
    "But Miss Waynfletes face grew\ngrave and anxious.",
    "She leaned forward and once more laid a hand on his arm.",
    "But be\nvery careful she said.",
    "Both of you must be very careful.",
    "You mean  with Lord Easterfield\n\nYes.",
    "It would be better not to tell him.",
    "Luke frowned.",
    "I dont think either of us would like the idea of that.",
    "Oh what does that matter You dont seem to realize that hes mad mad.",
    "He wont stand it  not for a moment If anything happens to her \n\nNothing shall happen to her\n\nYes I know but do realize that youre not a match for him Hes so\ndreadfully cunning Take her away at once its the only hope.",
    "Make\nher go abroad Youd better both go abroad\n\nLuke said slowly It might be as well if she went.",
    "I shall stay.",
    "I was afraid you would say that.",
    "But at any rate send her away.",
    "At\nonce mind\n\nLuke nodded slowly.",
    "I think he said that youre right.",
    "I know Im right Get her away  before its too late.",
    "Chapter 20\n\n\fBridget heard Luke drive up.",
    "She came out on the steps to meet him.",
    "She said without preamble Ive told him.",
    "What Luke was taken aback.",
    "His dismay was so patent that Bridget noticed it.",
    "Luke what is it You\nseem quite upset.",
    "He said slowly I thought we agreed to wait until I came back.",
    "I know but I thought it was better to get it over.",
    "He was making plans\n for our marriage our honeymoon  all that I simply had to tell him\nShe added  a touch of reproach in her voice  It was the only decent\nthing to do.",
    "He acknowledged it.",
    "From your point of view yes.",
    "Oh yes I see that.",
    "From every point of view I should have thought\n\nLuke said slowly There are times when one cant afford decency.",
    "Luke what do you mean\n\nHe made an impatient gesture.",
    "I cant tell you now and here.",
    "How did\nEasterfield take it\n\nBridget said slowly Extraordinarily well.",
    "Really extraordinarily well.",
    "I\nfelt ashamed.",
    "I believe Luke that Ive underestimated Gordon just\nbecause hes rather pompous and occasionally futile.",
    "I believe really\nhes rather  well a great little man.",
    "Luke nodded.",
    "Yes possibly he is a great man  in ways we havent\nsuspected.",
    "Look here Bridget you must get out of here as soon as\npossible.",
    "Naturally I shall pack up my things and leave today.",
    "You might drive\nme up to town.",
    "I suppose we cant both go and stay at the Bells and\nMotley  that is if the Ellsworthy contingent have left\n\nLuke shook his head.",
    "No youd better go back to London.",
    "Ill explain\npresently.",
    "In the meantime I suppose Id better see Easterfield.",
    "I suppose its the thing to do.",
    "Its all rather beastly isnt it I feel such\na rotten little gold digger.",
    "Luke smiled at her.",
    "It was a fair enough bargain.",
    "Youd have played\nstraight with him.",
    "Anyway its no use lamenting over things that are\npast and done with.",
    "Ill go in and see Easterfield now.",
    "He found Lord Easterfield striding up and down the drawing room.",
    "He\nwas outwardly calm there was even a slight smile on his lips.",
    "But Luke\nnoticed that a pulse in his temple was beating furiously.",
    "He wheeled\nround as Luke entered.",
    "Oh there you are Fitzwilliam.",
    "Luke said Its no good my saying Im sorry for what Ive done.",
    "That\nwould be hypocritical.",
    "I admit that from your point of view Ive behaved\nbadly and Ive very little to say in defense.",
    "These things happen.",
    "Lord Easterfield resumed his pacing.",
    "Quite  quite He waved a hand.",
    "Luke went on.",
    "Bridget and I have treated you shamefully.",
    "But there it\nis We care for each other and theres nothing to be done about it\nexcept to tell you the truth and clear out.",
    "Lord Easterfield stopped.",
    "He looked at Luke with his pale protuberant\neyes.",
    "No he said theres nothing you can do about it.",
    "There was a\nvery curious tone in his voice.",
    "He stood looking at Luke gently shaking\nhis head as though in commiseration.",
    "Luke said sharply What do you mean\n\nTheres nothing you can do said Lord Easterfield.",
    "Its too late.",
    "Luke took a step nearer him.",
    "Tell me what you mean\n\nLord Easterfield said unexpectedly Ask Honoria Waynflete.",
    "Shell\nunderstand.",
    "She knows what happens.",
    "She spoke to me about it\nonce.",
    "What does she understand\n\nLord Easterfield said Evil doesnt go unpunished.",
    "There must be\njustice.",
    "Im sorry because Im fond of Bridget.",
    "In a way Im sorry for\nyou both.",
    "Luke said Are you threatening us\n\n\fLord Easterfield seemed genuinely shocked.",
    "No no my dear fellow.",
    "Ive no feeling in the matter.",
    "When I did Bridget the honor to choose\nher as my wife she accepted certain responsibilities.",
    "Now she\nrepudiates them but theres no going back in this life.",
    "If you break\nlaws you pay the penalty.",
    "Luke clenched both hands.",
    "He said You mean that something is\ngoing to happen to Bridget Now understand me Easterfield nothing\nis going to happen to Bridget nor to me If you attempt anything of that\nkind its the finish.",
    "Youd better be careful I know a good deal about\nyou\n\nIts nothing to do with me said Lord Easterfield.",
    "Im only the\ninstrument of a higher Power.",
    "What that Power decrees happens.",
    "I see you believe that said Luke.",
    "Because its the truth Anyone who goes against me pays the penalty.",
    "You and Bridget will be no exception.",
    "Luke said Thats where youre wrong.",
    "However long a run of luck\nmay be it breaks in the end.",
    "Yours is very near breaking now.",
    "Lord Easterfield said gently My dear young man you dont know who\nit is youre talking to.",
    "Nothing can touch me\n\nCant it Well see.",
    "Youd better watch your step Easterfield.",
    "A little ripple of movement passed over the other.",
    "His voice had\nchanged when he spoke.",
    "Ive been very patient said Lord\nEasterfield.",
    "Dont strain my patience too far.",
    "Get out of here.",
    "Im going said Luke as quick as I can.",
    "Remember that Ive warned\nyou.",
    "He turned on his heel and went quickly out of the room.",
    "He ran\nupstairs.",
    "He found Bridget in her room superintending the packing of\nher clothes by a housemaid.",
    "Ready soon\n\nIn ten minutes.",
    "Her eyes asked a question which the presence of the maid prevented\nher from putting into words.",
    "Luke gave a short nod.",
    "He went to his own\nroom and flung his things hurriedly into his suitcases.",
    "He returned ten\nminutes later to find Bridget ready for departure.",
    "Shall we go now\n\nIm ready.",
    "As they descended the staircase they met the butler ascending.",

    "He had a knife in his hand  a long slender blade.",
    "Perfect\nworkmanship he was saying.",
    "One of my young men brought it back\nto me from Morocco where hed been special correspondent.",
    "Its\nMoorish of course a Riff knife.",
    "He drew a finger lovingly along the\nblade.",
    "What an edge\n\nMiss Waynflete said sharply Put it away Gordon for goodness\nsake\n\nHe smiled and laid it down among a collection of other weapons on the\ntable.",
    "I like the feel of it he said softly.",
    "Miss Waynflete had lost some of her usual poise.",
    "She looked white and\nnervous.",
    "Ah there you are Bridget my dear she said.",
    "Lord Easterfield chuckled.",
    "Yes theres Bridget.",
    "Make the most of her\nHonoria.",
    "She wont be with us long.",
    "Miss Waynflete said sharply What dyou mean\n\nMean I mean shes going to London.",

    "Well Ill leave you to have your\ntalk.",
    "He went out of the room his hands jingling the coins in his pockets.",
    "Oh dear said Miss Waynflete.",

    "I really am frightfully sorry.",
    "Miss Waynflete said Hes angry  hes frightfully angry.",
    "Oh dear this\nis terrible What are we going to do\n\nBridget stared.",
    "Do What do you mean\n\nMiss Waynflete said including them both in her reproachful glance\nYou should never have told him\n\nBridget said Nonsense.",
    "What else could we do\n\nYou shouldnt have told him now.",
    "You should have waited till youd got\nright away.",
    "Bridget said shortly Thats a matter of opinion.",
    "I think myself its\nbetter to get unpleasant things over as quickly as possible.",
    "Oh my dear if it were only a question of that  She stopped.",
    "Then her\neyes asked a question of Luke.",
    "Luke shook his head.",
    "His lips formed the words Not yet.",
    "Miss Waynflete murmured I see.",
    "Bridget said with some slight exasperation Did you want to see me\nabout something in particular.",
    "Miss Waynflete\n\nWell yes.",
    "As a matter of fact I came to suggest that you should come\nand pay me a little visit.",
    "I thought  er  you might find it uncomfortable\nto remain on here and that you might want a few days to  er  well\nmature your plans.",
    "Thank you Miss Waynflete that was very kind of you.",
    "You see youd be quite safe with me and \n\nBridget interrupted Safe\n\nMiss Waynflete a little flustered said hurriedly\n\nComfortable  thats what I mean  quite comfortable with me.",
    "I mean\nnot nearly so luxurious as here naturally but the hot water is hot and\nmy little maid Emily really cooks quite nicely.",
    "Oh Im sure everything would be lovely Miss Waynflete said Bridget\nmechanically.",
    "But of course if you are going up to town that is much better.",
    "Bridget said slowly Its a little awkward.",

    "Bridget got in.",
    "Luke started the engine and\ndrove rapidly down the drive.",
    "He gave a sigh of relief as they emerged\nfrom the iron gates.",
    "Thank God Ive got you out of there safely he\nsaid.",
    "Have you gone quite mad Luke Why all this hushhush I cant tell\nyou what I mean now business\n\nLuke said grimly Well there are difficulties you know in explaining\nthat a mans a murderer when youre actually under his roof.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nBridget sat for a minute motionless beside him.",
    "She said Gordon\nLuke nodded.",
    "Gordon Gordon a murderer Gordon the murderer I never heard\nanything so ridiculous in all my life\n\nThats how it strikes you\n\n\fYes indeed.",
    "Why Gordon wouldnt hurt a fly.",
    "Luke said grimly That may be true.",
    "I dont know.",
    "But he certainly\nkilled a canary bird and Im pretty certain hes killed a large number of\nhuman beings as well.",
    "My dear Luke I simply cant believe it\n\nI know said Luke.",
    "It does sound quite incredible.",
    "Why he never\neven entered my head as a possible suspect until the night before\nlast.",
    "Bridget protested But I know all about Gordon I know what hes like\nHes really a sweet little man  pompous yes but rather pathetic\nreally.",
    "Luke shook his head.",
    "Youve got to readjust your ideas about him\nBridget.",
    "Its no good Luke I simply cant believe it What put such an absurd\nidea into your head Why two days ago you were quite positive it was\nEllsworthy.",
    "Luke winced slightly.",
    "I know.",
    "I know.",
    "You probably think that\ntomorrow I shall suspect Thomas and the day after I shall be\nconvinced that its Horton Im after.",
    "Im not really so unbalanced as\nthat.",
    "I admit the ideas completely startling when it first comes to you\nbut if you look into it a bit closer youll see that it all fits in remarkably\nwell.",
    "No wonder Miss Fullerton didnt dare to go to the local\n\n\fauthorities.",
    "She knew theyd laugh at her Scotland Yard was her only\nhope.",
    "But what possible motive could Gordon have for all this killing\nbusiness Oh its all so silly\n\nI know.",
    "But dont you realize that Gordon Easterfield has a very\nexalted opinion of himself\n\nBridget said He pretends to be very wonderful and very important.",
    "Thats just inferiority complex poor lamb\n\nPossibly thats at the root of the trouble.",
    "I dont know.",
    "But think\nBridget  just think a minute.",
    "Remember all the phrases youve used\nlaughingly yourself about him  lesemajeste and so on.",
    "Dont you\nrealize that the mans ego is swollen out of all proportion And its\nallied with religion.",
    "My dear girl the mans as mad as a hatter\n\nBridget thought for a minute.",
    "She said at last I still cant believe it.",
    "What evidence have you got Luke\n\nWell there are his own words.",
    "He told me quite plainly and distinctly\nthe night before last that anyone who opposed him in any way always\ndied.",
    "Go on.",
    "I cant quite explain to you what I mean but it was the way he said it.",
    "Quite calm and complacent and  how shall I put it  quite used to the\n\n\fidea He just sat there smiling to himself.",
    "It was uncanny and rather\nhorrible Bridget\n\nGo on.",
    "Well then he went on to give me a list of people whod passed out\nbecause theyd incurred his sovereign displeasure And listen to this\nBridget the people he mentioned were Mrs. Horton Amy Gibbs\nTommy Pierce Harry Carter Humbleby and that chauffeur fellow\nRivers.",
    "Bridget was shaken at last.",
    "She went very pale.",
    "He mentioned those\nactual people\n\nThose actual people Now do you believe\n\nOh I suppose I must.",
    "What were his reasons\n\nHorribly trivial.",
    "Thats what made it so frightening.",
    "Mrs. Horton had\nsnubbed him Tommy Pierce had done imitations of him and made the\ngardeners laugh.",
    "Harry Carter had abused him Amy Gibbs had been\ngrossly impertinent Humbleby had dared to oppose him publicly.",
    "Rivers threatened him before me and Miss Waynflete.",
    "Bridget put her hands to her eyes.",
    "Horrible.",
    "Quite horrible she\nmurmured.",
    "I know.",
    "Then theres some other outside evidence.",
    "The car that ran\ndown Miss Fullerton in London was a Rolls and its number was the\nnumber of Lord Easterfields car.",
    "That definitely clinches it said Bridget slowly.",
    "Yes.",
    "The police thought the woman who gave them that number must\nhave made a mistake.",
    "Mistake indeed\n\nI can understand that said Bridget.",
    "When it comes to a rich powerful man like Lord Easterfield naturally\nhis story is the one to be believed.",
    "Yes.",
    "One appreciates Miss Fullertons difficulty.",
    "Bridget said thoughtfully Once or twice she said rather queer things\nto me.",
    "As though she were warning me against something.",
    "I didnt\nunderstand in the least at the time.",
    "I see now\n\nIt all fits in said Luke.",
    "Thats the way of it.",
    "At first one says  as you\nsaid  Impossible and then once one accepts the idea everything fits\nin.",
    "The grapes he sent to Mrs. Horton  and she thought the nurses\nwere poisoning her And that visit of his to the Wellerman Kreitz\nResearch Laboratories  Somehow or other he must have got hold of\nsome culture of germs and infected Humbleby.",
    "I dont see how he managed that.",
    "I dont either but the connection is there.",
    "One cant get away from\nthat.",
    "No.",
    "As you say it fits.",
    "And of course he could do things that other\npeople couldnt.",
    "I mean he would be so completely above suspicion.",
    "I think Miss Waynflete suspected.",
    "She mentioned that visit to the\nlaboratories.",
    "Brought it into conversation quite casually but I believe\nshe hoped Id act upon it.",
    "She knew then all along\n\nShe had a very strong suspicion.",
    "I think she was handicapped by\nhaving once been in love with him.",
    "Bridget nodded.",
    "Yes that accounts for several things.",
    "Gordon told\nme they had once been engaged.",
    "She wanted you see not to believe it was him.",
    "But she became more\nand more sure that it was.",
    "She tried to give me hints but she couldnt\nbear to do anything outright against him.",
    "Women are odd creatures.",
    "I\nthink in a way she still cares about him.",
    "Even after he jilted her\n\nShe jilted him.",
    "It was rather an ugly story.",
    "Ill tell you.",
    "He recounted\nthe short violent episode.",
    "Bridget stared at him.",
    "Gordon did that\n\nYes.",
    "Even in those days you see he cant have been normal.",
    "Bridget shivered and murmured All those years ago  all those years \n\nLuke said He may have got rid of a lot more people than we shall ever\nknow about.",
    "Its just the rapid succession of deaths lately that drew\nattention to him.",
    "As though hed got reckless with success.",
    "Bridget nodded.",
    "She was silent for a minute or two thinking then she\nsaid abruptly What exactly did Miss Fullerton say to you in the train\nthat day How did she begin\n\nLuke cast his mind back.",
    "Told me she was going to Scotland Yard\nmentioned the village constable said he was a nice fellow but not up\nto dealing with murder.",
    "That was the first mention of the word\n\nYes.",
    "Go on.",
    "Then she said Youre surprised I can see.",
    "I was myself at first.",
    "I\nreally couldnt believe it.",
    "I thought I must be imagining things.",
    "And then\n\nI asked her if she was sure she wasnt  imagining things I mean  and\nshe said quite placidly Oh no.",
    "It might have been the first time but\nnot the second or the third or the fourth.",
    "After that one knows.",
    "Marvelous commented Bridget.",
    "Go on.",
    "So of course I humored her said I was sure she was doing the right\nthing.",
    "I was an unbelieving Thomas if there ever was one.",
    "I know.",
    "So easy to be wise after the event.",
    "Id have felt just the same nice and superior to the poor old dame.",
    "How did the conversation go\non\n\nLet me see.",
    "Oh she mentioned the Abercrombie case  you know the\nWelsh poisoner.",
    "Said she hadnt really believed that there had been a\nlook  a special look  that he gave his victims.",
    "But that she believed it\nnow because she had seen it herself.",
    "What words did she use exactly\n\nLuke thought creasing his brow.",
    "She said still in that nice ladylike\nvoice Of course I didnt really believe that when I read about it but\nits true.",
    "And I said Whats true And she said The look on a\npersons face.",
    "And by Jove Bridget the way she said that absolutely\ngot me Her quiet voice and the look on her face  like someone who\nhad really seen something almost too horrible to speak about\n\nGo on Luke.",
    "Tell me everything.",
    "And then she enumerated the victims  Amy Gibbs and Carter and\nTommy Pierce and said that Tommy was a horrid boy and Carter\ndrank.",
    "And then she said But now  yesterday  it was Doctor\nHumbleby  and hes such a good man  a really good man.",
    "And she\n\n\fsaid if she went to Humbleby and told him he wouldnt believe her\nhed only laugh\n\nBridget gave a deep sigh.",
    "I see she said.",
    "I see.",
    "Luke looked at her.",
    "What is it Bridget What are you thinking of\n\nSomething Mrs. Humbleby once said.",
    "I wondered  No never mind go\non.",
    "What was it she said to you right at the end\n\nLuke repeated the words soberly.",
    "They had made an impression on\nhim and he was not likely to forget them.",
    "Id said it was difficult to get\naway with a lot of murders and she answered No no my dear boy\nthats where youre wrong.",
    "Its very easy to kill so long as no one\nsuspects you.",
    "And you see the person in question is just the last\nperson anyone would suspect.",
    "He was silent.",
    "Bridget said with a shiver Easy to kill Horribly easy  thats true\nenough No wonder those words stuck in your mind Luke.",
    "Theyll stick\nin mine  all my life A man like Gordon Easterfield  Oh of course its\neasy\n\nIts not so easy to bring it home to him said Luke.",
    "Dont you think so Ive an idea I can help there.",
    "Bridget I forbid you \n\nYou cant.",
    "One cant just sit back and play safe.",
    "Im in this Luke.",
    "It\nmay be dangerous  yes Ill admit that  but Ive got to play my part.",
    "Bridget \n\nIm in this Luke I shall accept Miss Waynfletes invitation and stay\ndown here.",
    "My darling I implore you \n\nIts dangerous for both of us.",
    "I know that.",
    "But were in it Luke  were\nin it together\n\nChapter 22\n\nThe calm interior of Miss Waynfletes house was almost an anticlimax\nafter that tense moment in the car.",
    "Miss Waynflete received Bridgets\nacceptance of her invitation a little doubtfully hastening however to\nreiterate her offer of hospitality by way of showing that her doubts\nwere due to quite another cause than unwillingness to receive the girl.",
    "Luke said I really think it will be the best thing since you are so kind\nMiss Waynflete.",
    "I am staying at the Bells and Motley.",
    "Id rather have\nBridget under my eye than up in town.",
    "After all remember what\nhappened there before.",
    "Miss Waynflete said You mean Lavinia Fullerton\n\n\fYes.",
    "You would have said wouldnt you that anyone would be quite\nsafe in the middle of a crowded city.",
    "You mean said Miss Waynflete that anyones safety depends\nprincipally on the fact that nobody wishes to kill them\n\nExactly.",
    "We have come to depend upon what has been called the\ngood will of civilization.",
    "Miss Waynflete nodded her head thoughtfully.",
    "Bridget said How long have you known that  that Gordon was the\nkiller Miss Waynflete\n\nMiss Waynflete sighed.",
    "That is a difficult question to answer my dear.",
    "I suppose that I have been quite sure in my inmost heart for some\ntime.",
    "But I did my best not to recognize that belief.",
    "You see I didnt\nwant to believe it and so I pretended to myself that it was a wicked and\nmonstrous idea on my part.",
    "Luke said bluntly Have you never been afraid for yourself\n\nMiss Waynflete considered.",
    "You mean that if Gordon had suspected\nthat I knew he would have found some means of getting rid of me\n\nYes.",
    "Miss Waynflete said gently I have of course been alive to that\npossibility.",
    "I tried to be careful of myself.",
    "But I do not think that Gordon\nwould have considered me a real menace.",
    "Why\n\nMiss Waynflete flushed a little.",
    "I dont think that Gordon would ever\nbelieve that I would do anything to  to bring him into danger.",
    "Luke said abruptly You went as far didnt you as to warn him\n\nYes.",
    "That is I did hint to him that it was odd that anyone who\ndispleased him should shortly meet with an accident.",
    "Bridget demanded And what did he say\n\nA worried expression passed over Miss Waynfletes face.",
    "He didnt\nreact at all in the way I meant.",
    "He seemed  really its most\nextraordinary  he seemed pleased.",
    "He said So youve noticed that\nHe quite  quite preened himself if I may use that expression.",
    "Hes mad of course said Luke.",
    "Miss Waynflete agreed eagerly Yes indeed there isnt any other\nexplanation possible.",
    "Hes not responsible for his acts.",
    "She laid a\nhand on Lukes arm.",
    "They  they wont hang him will they Mr.\nFitzwilliam\n\nNo no.",
    "Send him to Broadmoor I expect.",
    "Miss Waynflete sighed and leaned back.",
    "Im so glad.",
    "Her eyes rested on Bridget who was frowning down at\nthe carpet.",
    "Luke said But were a long way from all that still.",
    "Ive notified the\npowers that be and I can say this much Theyre prepared to take the\nmatter seriously.",
    "But you must realize that weve got remarkably little\nevidence to go upon.",
    "Well get evidence said Bridget.",
    "Miss Waynflete looked up at her.",
    "There was some quality in her\nexpression that reminded Luke of someone or something that he had\nseen not long ago.",
    "He tried to pin down the elusive memory but failed.",
    "Miss Waynflete said doubtfully You are confident my dear.",
    "Well\nperhaps you are right.",
    "Luke said Ill go along with the car Bridget and fetch your things\nfrom the manor.",
    "Bridget said immediately Ill come too.",
    "Id rather you didnt.",
    "Yes but Id rather come.",
    "Luke said irritably Dont do the motherandchild act with me\nBridget I refuse to be protected by you.",
    "Miss Waynflete murmured I really think Bridget that it will be quite\nall right  in the car and in daylight.",
    "Bridget gave a slightly shamefaced laugh.",
    "Im being rather an idiot.",
    "This business gets on ones nerves.",
    "Luke said Miss Waynflete protected me home the other night... Come\nnow Miss Waynflete admit it You did didnt you\n\nShe admitted it smiling.",
    "You see Mr. Fitzwilliam you were so\ncompletely unsuspicious.",
    "And if Gordon Easterfield had really grasped\nthe fact that you were down here to look into this business and for no\nother reason  well it wasnt very safe.",
    "And thats a very lonely lane.",
    "Anything might have happened\n\nWell Im alive to the danger now all right said Luke grimly.",
    "I shant\nbe caught napping I can assure you.",
    "Miss Waynflete said anxiously Remember he is very cunning.",
    "And\nmuch cleverer than you would ever imagine.",
    "Really a most ingenious\nmind.",
    "Im forewarned.",
    "Men have courage  one knows that said Miss Waynflete  but they\nare more easily deceived than women.",
    "Thats true said Bridget.",
    "Luke said Seriously Miss Waynflete do you really think that I am in\nany danger Do you think in film parlance that Lord Easterfield is\nreally out to get me\n\n\fMiss Waynflete hesitated.",
    "I think she said that the principal danger\nis to Bridget.",
    "It is her rejection of him that is the supreme insult.",
    "I think\nthat after he has dealt with Bridget he will turn his attention to you.",
    "But I think that undoubtedly he will try for her first.",
    "Luke groaned I wish to goodness youd go abroad  now  at once\nBridget.",
    "Bridgets lips set themselves together.",
    "Im not going.",
    "Miss Waynflete sighed.",
    "You are a brave creature Bridget.",
    "I admire\nyou.",
    "Youd do the same in my place.",
    "Well perhaps.",
    "Bridget said her voice dropping to a full rich note Luke and I are in\nthis together.",
    "She went out with him to the door.",
    "Luke said Ill give you a ring from\nthe Bells and Motley when Im safely out of the lions den.",
    "Yes do.",
    "My sweet dont lets get all het up Even the most accomplished\nmurderers have to have a little time to mature their plans.",
    "I should say\nwere quite all right for a day or two.",
    "Superintendent Battle is coming\n\n\fdown from London today.",
    "From then on Easterfield will be under\nobservation.",
    "In fact everything is O.K.",
    "and we can cut out the melodrama.",
    "Luke said gravely laying a hand on her shoulder Bridget my sweet\nyou will oblige me by not doing anything rash.",
    "Same to you darling Luke.",
    "He squeezed her shoulder jumped into the car and drove off.",
    "Bridget\nreturned to the sitting room.",
    "Miss Waynflete was fussing a little in a\ngentle spinsterish manner.",
    "My dear your rooms not quite ready yet.",
    "Emily is seeing to it.",
    "Do you know what Im going to do Im going to get\nyou a nice cup of tea.",
    "Its just what you need after all these upsetting\nincidents.",
    "Its frightfully kind of you.",
    "Miss Waynflete but I really dont want any.",
    "Bridget disliked tea intensely.",
    "It usually gave her indigestion.",
    "Miss\nWaynflete however had decided that tea was what her young guest\nneeded.",
    "She bustled out of the room and reappeared about five\nminutes later her face beaming carrying a tray on which stood two\ndainty Dresden cups full of a fragrant steaming beverage.",
    "Real Lapsang souchong said Miss Waynflete proudly.",
    "Bridget who\ndisliked China tea even more than Indian gave a wan smile.",
    "At that moment Emily a small clumsylooking girl with pronounced\nadenoids appeared in the doorway and said If you blease biss did\nyou bean the frilled billow cases\n\nMiss Waynflete hurriedly left the room and Bridget took advantage of\nthe respite to pour her tea out of the window narrowly escaping\nscalding Wonky Pooh who was on the flower bed below.",
    "Wonky Pooh accepted her apologies sprang up on the window sill and\nproceeded to wind himself in and out over Bridgets shoulders purring\nin an affected manner.",
    "Handsome said Bridget drawing a hand down his back.",
    "Wonky\nPooh arched his tail and purred with redoubled vigor.",
    "Nice pussy\nsaid Bridget tickling his ears.",
    "Miss Waynflete returned at that minute.",
    "Dear me she exclaimed.",
    "Wonky Pooh has quite taken to you hasnt\nhe Hes so standoffish as a rule Mind his ear my dear.",
    "Hes had a bad\near lately and its still very painful.",
    "The injunction came too late.",
    "Bridgets hand had tweaked the painful ear.",
    "Wonky Pooh spat at her\nand retired a mass of orange offended dignity.",
    "Oh dear has he\nscratched you cried Miss Waynflete.",
    "Nothing much said Bridget sucking a diagonal scratch on the back\nof her hand.",
    "Shall I put some iodine on\n\nOh no its quite all right.",
    "Dont lets fuss.",
    "Miss Waynflete seemed a little disappointed.",
    "Feeling that she had been\nungracious Bridget said hastily I wonder how long Luke will be\n\nNow dont worry my dear.",
    "Im sure Mr. Fitzwilliam is well able to take\ncare of himself.",
    "Oh Lukes tough all right\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang.",
    "Bridget hurried to it.",
    "Lukes voice spoke Hullo That you Bridget\nIm at the Bells and Motley.",
    "Can you wait for your traps till after lunch\nBecause Battle has arrived here  you know who I mean.",
    "The superintendent man from Scotland Yard\n\nYes.",
    "And he wants to have a talk with me right away.",
    "Thats all right by me.",
    "Bring my things round after lunch and tell me\nwhat he says about it all.",
    "Right.",
    "So long my sweet.",
    "Bridget replaced the receiver and retailed the conversation to Miss\nWaynflete.",
    "Then she yawned.",
    "A feeling of fatigue had succeeded her\nexcitement.",
    "Miss Waynflete noticed it.",
    "Youre tired my dear Youd\nbetter lie down.",
    "No perhaps that would be a bad thing just before\nlunch.",
    "I was just going to take some old clothes to a woman in a\n\n\fcottage not very far away  quite a pretty walk over the fields.",
    "Perhaps\nyoud care to come with me Well just have time before lunch.",
    "Bridget agreed willingly.",
    "They went out the back way.",
    "Miss Waynflete\nwore a straw hat and to Bridgets amusement had put on gloves.",
    "We\nmight be going to Bond Street she thought to herself.",
    "Miss Waynflete chatted pleasantly of various small village matters as\nthey walked.",
    "They went across two fields crossed a rough lane and\nthen took a path leading through a ragged copse.",
    "The day was hot and\nBridget found the shade of the trees pleasant.",
    "Miss Waynflete\nsuggested that they should sit down and rest a minute.",
    "Its really\nrather oppressively warm today dont you think I fancy there must be\nthunder about.",
    "Bridget acquiesced somewhat sleepily.",
    "She lay back against the bank\nher eyes half closed some lines of poetry wandering through her\nbrain\n\nO why do you walk through the fields in gloves\n\nO fat white woman whom nobody loves\n\nBut that wasnt quite right Miss Waynflete wasnt fat.",
    "She amended the\nwords to fit the case\n\nO why do you walk through the fields in gloves\n\nO lean gray woman whom nobody loves\n\n\fMiss Waynflete broke in upon her thoughts.",
    "Youre very sleepy dear\narent you\n\nThe words were said in a gentle everyday tone but something in them\njerked Bridgets eyes suddenly open.",
    "Miss Waynflete was leaning forward toward her.",
    "Her eyes were eager\nher tongue passed gently over her lips.",
    "She repeated her question\nYoure very sleepy arent you\n\nThis time there was no mistaking the definite significance of the tone.",
    "A flash passed through Bridgets brain  a lightning flash of\ncomprehension succeeded by one of contempt at her own density.",
    "She had suspected the truth but it had been no more than a dim\nsuspicion.",
    "She had meant working quietly and secretly to make sure.",
    "But not for one moment had she realized that anything was to be\nattempted against herself.",
    "She had she thought concealed her\nsuspicions entirely.",
    "Nor would she have dreamed that anything would be contemplated so\nsoon.",
    "Fool  seven times fool And she thought suddenly The tea  there was\nsomething in the tea.",
    "She doesnt know I never drank it.",
    "Nows my\nchance.",
    "I must pretend.",
    "What stuff was it I wonder Poison Or just\nsleeping stuff She expects me to be sleepy  thats evident.",
    "She let her eyelids droop again.",
    "In what she hoped was a natural\ndrowsy voice she said I do  frightfully.",
    "How funny I dont know when\nIve felt so sleepy.",
    "Miss Waynflete nodded softly.",
    "Bridget watched the older woman\nnarrowly through her almostclosed eyes.",
    "She thought Im a match\nfor her anyway.",
    "My muscles are pretty tough shes a skinny frail old\npussy.",
    "But Ive got to make her talk  thats it make her talk.",
    "Miss Waynflete was smiling.",
    "It was not a nice smile.",
    "It was sly and not\nvery human.",
    "Bridget thought Shes like a goat.",
    "How like a goat she is A goats\nalways been an evil symbol.",
    "I see why now.",
    "I was right  I was right in\nthat fantastic idea of mine.",
    "Hell has no fury like a woman scorned.",
    "That\nwas the start of it its all there.",
    "She murmured and this time her voice held a definite note of\napprehension I dont know whats the matter with me I feel so queer so very queer.",
    "Miss Waynflete gave a swift glance round her.",
    "The spot was entirely\ndesolate.",
    "It was too far from the village for a shout to be heard.",
    "There\nwere no houses or cottages near.",
    "She began to fumble with the parcel\nshe carried  the parcel that was supposed to contain old clothes.",
    "Apparently it did.",
    "The paper came apart revealing a soft woolly\ngarment.",
    "And still those gloved hands fumbled and fumbled.",
    "O why do you walk through the fields in gloves\n\nYes why Why gloves Of course Of course The whole thing so\nbeautifully planned\n\n\fThe wrapping fell aside.",
    "Carefully Miss Waynflete extracted the knife\nholding it very carefully so as not to obliterate the fingerprints which\nwere already on it  where the short podgy fingers of Lord Easterfield\nhad held it earlier that day in the drawing room at Ashe Manor.",
    "The\nMoorish knife with the sharp blade.",
    "Bridget felt slightly sick.",
    "She must play for time  yes and she must\nmake the woman talk  this lean gray woman whom nobody loved.",
    "It\nought not to be difficult  not really.",
    "Because she must want to talk oh so badly  and the only person she\ncould ever talk to was someone like Bridget  someone who was going\nto be silenced forever.",
    "Bridget said in a faint thick voice Whats that\nknife\n\nAnd then Miss Waynflete laughed.",
    "It was a horrible laugh soft and\nmusical and ladylike and quite inhuman.",
    "She said Its for you\nBridget.",
    "For you Ive hated you you know for a very long time.",
    "Bridget said Because I was going to marry Gordon Easterfield\n\nMiss Waynflete nodded.",
    "Youre clever.",
    "Youre quite clever This you\nsee will be the crowning proof against him.",
    "Youll be found here with\nyour throat cut  and his knife and his fingerprints on the knife Clever\nthe way I asked to see it this morning And then I slipped it into my bag\nwrapped in a handkerchief whilst you were upstairs.",
    "So easy But the\nwhole thing has been easy.",
    "I would hardly have believed it.",
    "Bridget said  still in the thick muffled voice of a person heavily\ndrugged Thats because youre so devilishly clever.",
    "Miss Waynflete laughed her ladylike little laugh again.",
    "She said with a\nhorrible kind of pride Yes I always had brains even as a girl.",
    "But\nthey wouldnt let me do anything.",
    "I had to stay at home doing nothing.",
    "And then Gordon  just a common bootmakers son but he had\nambition.",
    "I knew  I knew he would rise in the world.",
    "And then he jilted\nme  jilted me All because of that ridiculous business with the bird.",
    "Her hands made a queer gesture as though she were twisting\nsomething.",
    "Again a wave of sickness passed over Bridget.",
    "Gordon Ragg daring to jilt me Colonel Waynfletes daughter I swore\nId pay him out for that I used to think about it night after night.",
    "And\nthen we got poorer and poorer.",
    "The house had to be sold.",
    "He bought it\nHe came along patronizing me offering me a job in my own old home.",
    "How I hated him then But I never showed my feelings.",
    "We were taught\nthat as girls  a most valuable training.",
    "That I always think is where\nbreeding tells.",
    "She was silent a minute.",
    "Bridget watched her hardly daring to\nbreathe lest she should stem the flow of words.",
    "Miss Waynflete went on softly All the time I was thinking and thinking.",
    "First of all I just thought of killing him.",
    "Thats when I began to read up\ncriminology  quietly you know  in the library.",
    "And really I found my\nreading came in most useful more than once later.",
    "The door of Amys\nroom for instance turning the key in the lock from the outside with\npincers after Id changed the bottles by her bed.",
    "How she snored that\ngirl.",
    "Quite disgusting it was She paused.",
    "Let me see where was I\n\n\fThat gift which Bridget had cultivated which had charmed Lord\nEasterfield  the gift of the perfect listener  stood her in good stead\nnow.",
    "Honoria Waynflete might be a homicidal maniac but she was also\nsomething much more common than that.",
    "She was a human being who\nwanted to talk about herself.",
    "And with that class of human being\nBridget was well fitted to cope.",
    "She said and her voice had exactly the\nright invitation in it You meant at first to kill him.",
    "Yes but that didnt satisfy me  much too ordinary.",
    "It had to be\nsomething better than just killing.",
    "And then I got this idea.",
    "It just came\nto me.",
    "He should suffer for committing a lot of crimes of which he was\nquite innocent.",
    "He should be a murderer He should be hanged for my\ncrimes Or else theyd say he was mad and he would be shut up all his\nlife.",
    "That might be even better.",
    "She giggled now.",
    "A horrible little giggle.",
    "Her eyes were light and\nstaring with queer elongated pupils.",
    "As I told you I read a lot of books on crime.",
    "I chose my victims\ncarefully there was not to be too much suspicion at first.",
    "You see \nher voice deepened  I enjoyed the killing.",
    "That disagreeable woman\nLydia Horton  shed patronized me  once she referred to me as an old\nmaid.",
    "I was glad when Gordon quarreled with her.",
    "Two birds with one\nstone I thought.",
    "Such fun sitting by her bedside and slipping the\narsenic in her tea and then going out and telling the nurse how Mrs.\nHorton had complained of the bitter taste of Lord Easterfields grapes\nThe stupid woman never repeated that which was such a pity.",
    "And then the others As soon as I heard that Gordon had a grievance\nagainst anyone it was so easy to arrange for an accident And he was\n\n\fsuch a fool  such an incredible fool I made him believe that there was\nsomething very special about him That anyone who went against him\nsuffered.",
    "He believed it quite easily.",
    "Poor dear Gordon hed believe\nanything.",
    "So gullible\n\nBridget thought of herself saying to Luke scornfully Gordon He\ncould believe anything\n\nEasy How easy Poor pompous credulous little Gordon.",
    "But she must\nlearn more.",
    "Easy This was easy too.",
    "Shed done it as a secretary for\nyears.",
    "Quietly encouraged her employers to talk about themselves.",
    "And this woman wanted badly to talk to boast about her own\ncleverness.",
    "Bridget murmured But how did you manage it all I dont\nsee how you could.",
    "Oh it was quite easy.",
    "It just needed organization When Amy was\ndischarged from the Manor I engaged her at once.",
    "I think the hatpaint\nidea was quite clever  and the door being locked on the inside made\nme quite safe.",
    "But of course I was always safe because I never had\nany motive and you cant suspect anyone of murder if there isnt a\nmotive.",
    "Carter was quite easy too he was lurching about in the fog\nand I caught up with him on the footbridge and gave him a quick push.",
    "Im really very strong you know.",
    "She paused and the soft horrible little giggle came again.",
    "The whole\nthing was such fun I shall never forget Tommys face when I pushed\nhim off the window sill that day.",
    "He hadnt had the least idea.",
    "She\nleaned toward Bridget confidentially.",
    "People are really very stupid\nyou know.",
    "Id never realized that before.",
    "Bridget said very softly But then youre unusually clever.",
    "Yes yes perhaps youre right.",
    "Bridget said Doctor Humbleby  that must have been more difficult\n\nYes it was really amazing how that succeeded.",
    "It might not have\nworked of course.",
    "But Gordon had been talking to everybody of his\nvisit to the Wellerman Kreitz Laboratories and I thought if I could\nmanage it so that people remembered that visit and connected it\nafterwards  And Wonky Poohs ear was really very nasty a lot of\ndischarge.",
    "I managed to run the point of my scissors into the doctors\nhand and then I was so distressed and insisted on putting on a\ndressing and bandaging it up.",
    "He didnt know the dressing had been\ninfected first from Wonky Poohs ear.",
    "Of course it mightnt have\nworked it was just a long shot.",
    "I was delighted when it did  especially\nas Wonky Pooh had been Lavinias cat.",
    "Her face darkened.",
    "Lavinia Fullerton She guessed.",
    "It was she who\nfound Tommy that day.",
    "And then when Gordon and old Doctor\nHumbleby had that row she caught me looking at Humbleby.",
    "I was off\nmy guard.",
    "I was just wondering exactly how Id do it.",
    "And she knew I\nturned round to find her watching me and  I gave myself away.",
    "I saw\nthat she knew.",
    "She couldnt prove anything of course I knew that.",
    "But\nI was afraid all the same someone might believe her.",
    "I was afraid they\nmight believe her at Scotland Yard.",
    "I felt sure that was where she was\ngoing that day.",
    "I was in the same train and I followed her.",
    "The whole thing was so easy.",
    "She was on an island crossing\nWhitehall.",
    "I was close behind her.",
    "She never saw me.",
    "A big car came\nalong and I shoved with all my might.",
    "Im very strong She went right\ndown in front of it.",
    "I told the woman next to me Id seen the number of\nthe car and gave her the number of Gordons Rolls.",
    "I hoped shed\nrepeat it to the police.",
    "It was lucky the car didnt stop.",
    "Some chauffeur\njoyriding without his masters knowledge I suspect.",
    "Yes I was lucky\nthere.",
    "Im always lucky.",
    "That scene the other day with Rivers and Luke\nFitzwilliam as witness.",
    "Ive had such fun with him leading him along\nOdd how difficult it was to make him suspect Gordon.",
    "But after Rivers\ndeath he would be sure to do so.",
    "He must And now  well this will just\nfinish the whole thing nicely.",
    "She got up and came toward Bridget.",
    "She said softly Gordon jilted me He was going to marry you.",
    "All my\nlife Ive been disappointed.",
    "Ive had nothing  nothing at all...\n\nO lean gray woman whom nobody loves\n\nShe was bending over her smiling with mad light eyes.",
    "The knife\ngleamed.",
    "With all her youth and strength Bridget sprang.",
    "Like a tiger cat she\nflung herself full force on the other woman knocking her back seizing\nher right wrist.",
    "Taken by surprise Honoria Waynflete fell back before the onslaught.",
    "But then after a moments inertia she began to fight.",
    "In strength there\nwas no comparison between them.",
    "Bridget was young and healthy\n\n\fwith muscles toughened by games.",
    "Honoria Waynflete was a slenderbuilt fragile creature.",
    "But there was one factor on which Bridget had\nnot reckoned.",
    "Honoria Waynflete was mad.",
    "Her strength was the\nstrength of the insane.",
    "She fought like a devil and her insane strength\nwas stronger than the sane muscled strength of Bridget.",
    "They swayed to and fro and still Bridget strove to wrest the knife away\nfrom her and still Honoria Waynflete hung on to it.",
    "And then little by little the mad womans strength began to prevail.",
    "Bridget cried out now Luke Help Help But she had no hope of help\ncoming.",
    "She and Honoria Waynflete were alone.",
    "Alone in a dead world.",
    "With a supreme effort she wrenched the others wrist back and at last\nshe heard the knife fall.",
    "The next minute Honoria Waynfletes two\nhands had fastened round her neck in a maniacs grasp squeezing the\nlife out of her.",
    "She gave one last choked cry.",
    "Chapter 23\n\nLuke was favorably impressed by the appearance of Superintendent\nBattle.",
    "He was a solid comfortablelooking man with a broad red face\nand a large handsome mustache.",
    "He did not exactly express brilliance\nat a first glance but a second glance was apt to make an observant\nperson thoughtful for Superintendent Battles eye was unusually\nshrewd.",
    "Luke did not make the mistake of underestimating him.",
    "He had met\nmen of Battles type before.",
    "He knew that they could be trusted and\nthat they invariably got results.",
    "He could not have wished for a better\nman to be put in charge of the case.",
    "When they were alone together\nLuke said Youre rather a big noise to be sent down on a case like\nthis.",
    "Superintendent Battle smiled.",
    "It may turn out to be a serious\nbusiness Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "When a man like Lord Easterfield is\nconcerned we dont want to have any mistakes.",
    "I appreciate that.",
    "Are you alone\n\nOh no.",
    "Got a detective sergeant with me.",
    "Hes at the other pub the\nSeven Stars and his job is to keep an eye on his lordship.",
    "I see.",
    "Battle asked In your opinion Mr. Fitzwilliam theres no doubt\nwhatever Youre pretty sure of your man\n\nOn the facts I dont see that any alternative theory is possible.",
    "Do you\nwant me to give you the facts\n\nIve had them thank you from Sir William.",
    "Well what do you think I suppose it seems to you wildly unlikely that\na man in Lord Easterfields position should be a homicidal criminal\n\n\fVery few things seem unlikely to me said Superintendent Battle.",
    "Nothings impossible in crime.",
    "Thats what Ive always said.",
    "If you\nwere to tell me that a dear old maiden lady or an archbishop or a\nschoolgirl was a dangerous criminal I wouldnt say no.",
    "Id look into\nthe matter.",
    "If youve heard the main facts of the case from Sir William Ill just tell\nyou what happened this morning said Luke.",
    "He ran over briefly the main lines of his scene with Lord Easterfield.",
    "Superintendent Battle listened with a good deal of interest.",
    "He said You say he was fingering a knife.",
    "Did he make a special point\nof that knife Mr. Fitzwilliam Was he threatening with it\n\nNot openly.",
    "He tested the edge in rather a nasty way  a kind of\nesthetic pleasure about that that I didnt care about.",
    "Miss Waynflete\nfelt the same I believe.",
    "Thats the lady you spoke about  the one whos known Lord\nEasterfield all her life and was once engaged to marry him\n\nThats right.",
    "Superintendent Battle said I think you can make your mind easy\nabout the young lady Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "Ill have someone put on to keep\na sharp watch on her.",
    "With that and with Jackson tailing his lordship\nthere ought to be no danger of anything happening.",
    "You relieve my mind a good deal said Luke.",
    "The superintendent nodded sympathetically.",
    "Its a nasty position for you Mr. Fitzwilliam.",
    "Worrying about Miss\nConway.",
    "Mind you I dont expect this will be an easy case.",
    "Lord\nEasterfield must be a pretty shrewd man.",
    "He will probably lie low for a\ngood long while.",
    "That is unless hes got to the last stage.",
    "What do you call the last stage\n\nA kind of swollen egoism where a criminal thinks he simply cant be\nfound out.",
    "Hes too clever and everybody else is too stupid.",
    "Then of\ncourse we get him.",
    "Luke nodded.",
    "He rose.",
    "Well he said I wish you luck.",
    "Let me help in\nany way I can.",
    "Certainly.",
    "Theres nothing that you can suggest\n\nBattle turned the question over in his mind.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "Not at the\nmoment.",
    "I just want to get the general hang of things in the place.",
    "Perhaps I could have another word with you in the evening\n\nRather.",
    "I shall know better where we are then.",
    "Luke felt vaguely comforted and soothed.",
    "Many\n\npeople\n\nhad\n\nhad\n\nthat\n\nfeeling\n\nafter\n\nan\n\ninterview\n\nwith\n\nSuperintendent Battle.",
    "He glanced at his watch.",
    "Should he go round\nand see Bridget before lunch Better not he thought.",
    "Miss Waynflete\nmight feel that she had to ask him to stay for the meal and it might\ndisorganize her housekeeping.",
    "Middleaged ladies Luke knew from\nexperience with aunts were liable to be fussed over problems of\nhousekeeping.",
    "He wondered if Miss Waynflete was an aunt Probably.",
    "He had strolled out to the door of the inn.",
    "A figure in black hurrying\ndown the street stopped suddenly when she saw him.",
    "Mr.\nFitzwilliam.",
    "Mrs. Humbleby.",
    "He came forward and shook hands.",
    "She said I thought you had left.",
    "No only changed my quarters.",
    "Im staying here now.",
    "And Bridget I heard she had left Ashe Manor.",
    "Yes she has.",
    "Mrs. Humbleby sighed.",
    "I am so glad  so very glad she has gone right\naway from Wychwood.",
    "Oh shes still here.",
    "As a matter of fact shes staying with Miss\nWaynflete.",
    "Mrs. Humbleby moved back a step.",
    "Her face Luke noted with surprise\nlooked extraordinarily distressed.",
    "Staying with Honoria Waynflete\nOh but why\n\nMiss Waynflete very kindly asked her to stay for a few days.",
    "Mrs. Humbleby gave a little shiver.",
    "She came close to Luke and laid a\nhand on his arm.",
    "Mr. Fitzwilliam I know I have no right to say anything  anything at all.",
    "I have had a lot of sorrow and grief lately and perhaps it makes me\nfanciful.",
    "These feelings of mine may be only sick fancies.",
    "Luke said gently What feelings\n\nThis conviction I have of  of evil She looked timidly at Luke.",
    "Seeing\nthat he merely bowed his head gravely and did not appear to question\nher statement she went on So much wickedness  that is the thought\nthat is always with me  wickedness here in Wychwood.",
    "And that\nwoman is at the bottom of it all.",
    "I am sure of it.",
    "Luke was mystified.",
    "What woman\n\nMrs. Humbleby said Honoria Waynflete is I am sure a very wicked\nwoman Oh I see you dont believe me No one believed Lavinia\nFullerton either.",
    "But we both felt it.",
    "She I think knew more than I did.",
    "Remember Mr. Fitzwilliam if a woman is not happy she is capable of\nterrible things.",
    "Luke said gently That may be yes.",
    "Mrs. Humbleby said quickly You dont believe me Well why should\nyou But I cant forget the day when John came home with his hand\nbound up from her house though he poohpoohed it and said it was\nonly a scratch.",
    "She turned.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Please forget what I have just\nsaid.",
    "I  I dont feel quite myself these days.",
    "Luke watched her go.",
    "He wondered why Mrs. Humbleby called\nHonoria Waynflete a wicked woman.",
    "Had Doctor Humbleby and\nHonoria Waynflete been friends and was the doctors wife jealous\nWhat had she said No one believed Lavinia Fullerton either.",
    "Then\nLavinia Fullerton must have confided some of her suspicions to Mrs.\nHumbleby.",
    "With a rush the memory of the railway carriage came back and the\nworried face of a nice old lady.",
    "He heard again an earnest voice\nsaying The look on a persons face.",
    "And the way her own face had\nchanged as though she were seeing something very clearly in her\nmind.",
    "Just for a moment he thought her face had been quite different\nthe lips drawn back from the teeth and a queer almost gloating look in\nher eyes.",
    "He suddenly thought But Ive seen someone look just like that  that\nsame expression.",
    "Quite lately.",
    "When This morning.",
    "Of course.",
    "Miss\nWaynflete when she was looking at Bridget in the drawing room at the\nManor.",
    "And quite suddenly another memory assailed him.",
    "One of\nmany years ago.",
    "His Aunt Mildred saying She looked you know my\ndear quite halfwitted.",
    "And just for a minute her own sane\ncomfortable face had borne an imbecile mindless expression.",
    "Lavinia Fullerton had been speaking of the look she had seen on a\nmans  no a persons  face.",
    "Was it possible that just for a second her\nvivid imagination had reproduced the look that she saw  the look of a\nmurderer looking at his next victim\n\nHalf unaware of what he was doing Luke quickened his pace toward\nMiss Waynfletes house.",
    "A voice in his brain was saying over and over\nagain Not a man  she never mentioned a man.",
    "You assumed it was a\nman because you were thinking of a man but she never said so.",
    "Oh\nGod am I quite mad It isnt possible what Im thinking.",
    "Surely it isnt\npossible it wouldnt make sense.",
    "But I must get to Bridget.",
    "I must\nknow shes all right.",
    "Those eyes  those queer amber eyes.",
    "Oh Im\nmad.",
    "I must be mad.",
    "Easterfields the criminal.",
    "He must be.",
    "He\npractically said so.",
    "And still like a nightmare he saw Miss Fullertons\nface in its momentary impersonation of something horrible and not\nquite sane.",
    "The stunted little maid opened the door to him.",
    "A little startled by his\nvehemence she said The ladys gone out.",
    "Miss Waynflete told me so.",
    "Ill see if Miss Waynfletes in.",
    "He pushed past her went into the drawing room.",
    "Emily ran upstairs.",
    "She came down breathless.",
    "The mistress is out too.",
    "Luke took her by the shoulder.",
    "Which way Where did they go\n\nShe gaped at him.",
    "They must have gone out by the back.",
    "Id have seen\nthem if theyd gone out front ways because the kitchen looks out\nthere.",
    "She followed him as he raced out through the door into the tiny garden\nand out beyond.",
    "There was a man clipping a hedge.",
    "Luke went up to him and asked a question striving to keep his voice\nnormal.",
    "The man said slowly Two ladies Yes.",
    "Some while since.",
    "I was having\nmy dinner under the hedge.",
    "Reckon they didnt notice me.",
    "Which way did they go\n\nHe strove desperately to make his voice normal.",
    "Yet the others eyes\nopened a little wider as he replied slowly Across them fields.",
    "Over\nthat way.",
    "I dont know where after that.",
    "Luke thanked him and began to run.",
    "His strong feeling of urgency was\ndeepened.",
    "He must catch up with them  he must He might be quite\nmad.",
    "In all probability they were just taking an amicable stroll but\nsomething in him clamored for haste.",
    "More haste He crossed the two\nfields stood hesitating in a country lane.",
    "Which way now And then he\nheard the call  faint far away but unmistakable Luke Help And\nagain Luke Unerringly he plunged into the wood and ran in the\ndirection from which the cry had come.",
    "There were more sounds now scuffling panting a low gurgling cry.",
    "He came through the trees in time to tear a mad womans hands from\nher victims throat to hold her struggling foaming cursing till at last\nshe gave a convulsive shudder and turned rigid in his grasp.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nBut I dont understand said Lord Easterfield.",
    "I dont understand.",
    "He strove to maintain his dignity but beneath the pompous exterior a\nrather pitiable bewilderment was evident.",
    "He could hardly credit the\nextraordinary things that were being told him.",
    "Its like this.",
    "Lord Easterfield said Battle patiently.",
    "To begin with\nthere is a touch of insanity in the family.",
    "Weve found that out now.",
    "Often the way with these old families.",
    "I should say she had a\npredisposition that way.",
    "And then she was an ambitious lady and she\nwas thwarted.",
    "First her career and then her love affair.",
    "He coughed.",
    "I understand it was you who jilted her.",
    "Lord Easterfield said stiffly I dont like the term jilt.",
    "Superintendent Battle amended the phrase It was you who\nterminated the engagement\n\nWell yes.",
    "Tell us why Gordon said Bridget.",
    "Lord Easterfield got rather red.",
    "He said Oh very well if I must.",
    "Honoria had a canary.",
    "She was very fond of it.",
    "It used to take sugar\nfrom her lips.",
    "One day it pecked her violently instead.",
    "She was angry\n\n\fand picked it up and  wrung its neck I  I couldnt feel the same after\nthat.",
    "I told her I thought wed both made a mistake.",
    "Battle nodded.",
    "He said That was the beginning of it.",
    "As she told Miss\nConway she turned her thoughts and her undoubted mental ability to\none aim and purpose.",
    "Lord Easterfield said incredulously To get me convicted as a\nmurderer I cant believe it.",
    "Bridget said Its true Gordon.",
    "You know you were surprised yourself\nat the extraordinary way that everybody who annoyed you was\ninstantly struck down.",
    "There was a reason for that.",
    "Honoria Waynflete was the reason said Bridget.",
    "Do get it into your\nhead Gordon that it wasnt Providence that pushed Tommy Pierce out\nof the window and all the rest of them.",
    "It was Honoria.",
    "Lord Easterfield shook his head.",
    "It all seems to me quite incredible\nhe said.",
    "Battle said You say you got a telephone message this morning\n\nYes about twelve oclock.",
    "I was asked to go to the Shaw Wood at\nonce as you Bridget had something to say to me.",
    "I was not to come\nby car but to walk.",
    "Battle nodded.",
    "Exactly.",
    "That would have been the finish.",
    "Miss Conway\nwould have been found with her throat cut and beside her your knife\nwith your fingerprints on it And you yourself would have been seen in\nthe vicinity at the time You wouldnt have had a leg to stand upon.",
    "Any\njury in the world would have convicted you.",
    "Me said Lord Easterfield startled and distressed.",
    "Anyone would\nhave believed a thing like that of me\n\nBridget said gently I didnt Gordon.",
    "I never believed it.",
    "Lord Easterfield looked at her coldly then he said stiffly In view of my\ncharacter and my standing in the country I do not believe that anyone\nfor one moment would have believed such a monstrous charge.",
    "He\nwent out with dignity and closed the door behind him.",
    "Luke said Hell never realize that he was really in danger.",
    "Then he\nsaid Go on Bridget.",
    "Tell me how you came to suspect the Waynflete\nwoman.",
    "Bridget explained It was when you were telling me that Gordon was\nthe killer.",
    "I couldnt believe it You see I knew him so well.",
    "Id been his\nsecretary for two years.",
    "I knew him in and out.",
    "I knew that he was\npompous and petty and completely selfabsorbed but I knew too that\nhe was a kindly person and almost absurdly tenderhearted.",
    "It worried\nhim even to kill a wasp.",
    "That story about his killing Miss Waynfletes\ncanary  it was all wrong.",
    "He just couldnt have done it.",
    "Hed told me\nonce that he had jilted her.",
    "Now you insisted that it was the other way\nabout.",
    "Well that might be so His pride might not have allowed him to\nadmit that she had thrown him over.",
    "But not the canary story That\n\n\fsimply wasnt Gordon He didnt even shoot because seeing things\nkilled made him feel sick.",
    "So I simply knew that that part of the story was untrue.",
    "But if so.",
    "Miss\nWaynflete must have lied.",
    "And it was really when you came to think of\nit a very extraordinary lie.",
    "And I wondered suddenly if shed told any\nmore lies.",
    "She was a very proud woman  one could see that.",
    "To be\nthrown over must have hurt her pride horribly.",
    "It would probably make\nher feel very angry and revengeful against Lord Easterfield especially I felt if he turned up again later all rich and prosperous\nand successful.",
    "I thought Yes shed probably enjoy helping to fix a\ncrime upon him.",
    "And then a curious sort of whirling feeling came in my\nbrain and I thought But suppose everything she says is a lie and I\nsuddenly saw how easily a woman like that could make a fool of a man.",
    "And I thought Its fantastic but suppose it was she who killed all\nthese people and fed Gordon up with the idea that it was a kind of\ndivine retribution.",
    "It would be quite easy for her to make him believe\nthat.",
    "As I told you once Gordon would believe anything And I thought\nCould she have done all those murders And I saw that she could\nShe could give a shove to a drunken man push a boy out of a window\nand Amy Gibbs had died in her house.",
    "Mrs. Horton too  she used to go\nand sit with her when she was ill.",
    "Doctor Humbleby was more difficult.",
    "I didnt know then that Wonky Pooh had a nasty septic ear.",
    "Miss\nFullertons death was even more difficult because I couldnt imagine\nMiss Waynflete dressed up as a chauffeur driving a Rolls.",
    "And then suddenly I saw that that was the easiest of the lot It was\nthe old shove from behind  easily done in a crowd.",
    "The car didnt stop\nand she saw a fresh opportunity and told another woman she had seen\nthe number of the car and gave the number of Lord Easterfields Rolls.",
    "Of course all this only came very confusedly through my head.",
    "But if\nGordon definitely hadnt done the murders  and I knew yes knew that\nhe hadnt  well who did And the answer seemed quite clear.",
    "Someone who hates Gordon Who hates Gordon Honoria Waynflete of\ncourse.",
    "And then I remembered that Miss Fullerton had definitely spoken of a\nman as the killer.",
