    "\fThe Seven\nDials Mystery\n\n\n\n\fIntroduction\nby Val McDermid\n\nThings that everybody knows about Agatha Christie she produced a lot of\nbooks that still outsell the competition she was the greatest plotter of the\nclassic detective story she did a vanishing act and turned up amnesiac in\nHarrogate identified by the banjo player in the hotel band she wrote the\nlongestrunning play in theatrical history The Mousetrap and she couldn\u2019t\nwrite thrillers.",
    "So why am I suggesting that anyone would want to read The Seven Dials\nMystery After all it has all the ingredients of the classic 1920s thriller as\nexemplified by A. E. W. Mason Sapper and John Buchan.",
    "Secret plans evil\nforeigners marvellous cars with running boards and powerful engines the\njoint threats of Germany and Communist Russia house parties young men\nwandering round with loaded revolvers and plucky young women\u2014they\u2019re\nall there by the bucketload.",
    "Oh and let\u2019s not forget the secret society that meets behind closed doors\nwhose members are masked so not even they know who the other members\nare.",
    "Bulldog Drummond and Richard Hannay territory surely Which we\nknow that Christie can\u2019t do.",
    "Right\nWrong.",
    "Because The Seven Dials Mystery isn\u2019t a thriller.",
    "It\u2019s a pastiche of\na thriller an antidote to the gungho chestbeating of the boys.",
    "It\u2019s wry it\u2019s\ngot its tongue planted firmly in its cheek and it subverts the whole genre it\nappears to be part of not least because as well as all of this it also delivers\ncleverly dovetailed plotting with a typical Christie flourish at the end.",
    "\u201cAh\nyes\u201d we sigh.",
    "\u201cFooled again.\u201d If one of our Young Turks did something\nsimilar with the thriller now we\u2019d all nod sagely and go \u201chow very\npostmodern how very selfreferential and knowing how very metafictional.\u201d\nBut that was then and this is now.",
    "So Christie gets no credit for poking her\ntongue out at the big boys who set the agenda for what a thriller should be.",
    "I\nmean how can a nice middleclass wife and mother be considered a\nsubversive How embarrassing would that be for the leatherjacketed\n\n\ficonoclasts\nBut the fact remains that The Seven Dials Mystery really doesn\u2019t perform\nas expected.",
    "As well as showing that when it came to sleight of hand Agatha Christie\njust couldn\u2019t help herself what The Seven Dials Mystery reveals is the side of\nits author that everybody seems to forget.",
    "Not surprisingly when you look at\nthose stern jacket photographs .",
    ". . She had a sense of humour.",
    "It was sly and\nshrewd and never far from the surface.",
    "It\u2019s there in the very first Jane Marple mystery in the character of\nGriselda the hopelessly inappropriate wife of the very conservative vicar.",
    "And it continues in the Marple novels with for example a series of sly digs at\nMiss Marple\u2019s nephew the literary novelist Raymond West whose\npretensions are a constant source of bubblebursting on Christie\u2019s part.",
    "And it\u2019s there in the Poirot mysteries too.",
    "Perhaps Christie\u2019s funniest as\nwell as her most selfreferential character appears regularly there\u2014the crime\nwriter Ariadne Oliver.",
    "Mrs. Oliver with her perpetually bursting bags of\napples and her disregard for convention is clearly a thinly disguised version\nof Christie herself.",
    "Where Christie has her Belgian detective whom she came to dislike\nintensely Mrs. Oliver has a Finn.",
    "She is constantly to be heard complaining\nbitterly about her folly in creating a depressive detective from a country about\nwhich she knew nothing and has had to learn far too much.",
    "She moans that\nher publisher and her readers won\u2019t let her kill him off because they like him\ntoo much.",
    "All of this is delivered in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to avoid a\nwry smile at the character\u2019s expense and at Christie\u2019s too.",
    "From the very first paragraph of The Seven Dials Mystery we should be in\nno doubt that we\u2019re in a world of Wodehousian insouciance.",
    "No one could\nhave written such an opening not even in 1929 without being conscious of\nits parodic quality.",
    "That amiable youth Jimmy Thesiger came racing down the big staircase\nat Chimneys two steps at a time.",
    "So precipitate was his descent that he\ncollided with Tredwell the stately butler just as the latter was crossing\nthe hall bearing a fresh supply of hot coffee.",
    "Owing to the marvellous\npresence of mind and masterly agility of Tredwell no casualty occurred.",
    "\u201cSorry\u201d apologized Jimmy.",
    "\u201cI say Tredwell am I the last down\u201d\nSubstitute Bertie Wooster for Jimmy Thesiger and Jeeves for Tredwell\nand it wouldn\u2019t feel at all out of place.",
    "I think it\u2019s safe to say that Christie\nwasn\u2019t setting up in competition with Buchan and Sapper when she wrote this\nnovel.",
    "When critics consider Christie now they often point to the apparent\nintolerance and lack of political correctness revealed by her attitudes to class\nand to other races.",
    "It\u2019s true that she patronises the lower classes and is\nextraordinarily offensive about Jews Germans and Russians among others.",
    "But in this she reflected the attitudes of a woman of her class and generation.",
    "It would have been remarkable if she had displayed different attitudes.",
    "Even a\nfeminist icon like Virginia Woolf writing at around the same time displays\nan unnerving lack of insight into the lives and dreams of the \u201cservant classes.\u201d\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped people leaping on Christie as an example of all\nthat is worst about the English.",
    "She\u2019s accused of snobbery of insensitivity of\nracial and class stereotyping.",
    "But how valid are these criticisms For myself I\u2019ve always thought that\nthe true test of people\u2019s beliefs lies in their sense of humour.",
    "What they find\nfunny will tell you far more about someone than their serious professions of\nbelief.",
    "It\u2019s often seemed to me that those we make the butts of our jokes are\nthose for whom we nurse our deepest and most secret contempt.",
    "So what does Christie make fun of in this novel\nWell first there is the aristocracy.",
    "The egotistical indolent and almost\nindigent Lord Caterham a title absurd in itself Caterham being the epitome\nof stifling Home Counties suburbia is drawn with affection but where\nBuchan or Sapper would have shown him as a figure of status worthy of\nrespect and trust Christie shows him as a figure of fun who is indulged by his\nfeisty daughter.",
    "He\u2019s a nottoodistant relative of Wodehouse\u2019s Lord\nEmsworth.",
    "Christie teases the nouveau riche just as wickedly.",
    "Sir Oswald and Lady\nCoote are perceptively lampooned the one for his overreaching ambition the\nother for her failure to escape her lower middleclass sensibilities.",
    "We see her\ntreated with disdain by the servants while her husband fails to see how little\nacceptance his wealth his title and his material success have brought him.",
    "But the upper middle classes are given no more leeway than the arrivistes.",
    "The Seven Dials Mystery is peppered with ineffectual Oxbridge Foreign\nOffice young men being rescued by their women.",
    "The men are silly asses\nwho avoid disaster more by luck and having the right people behind them\nthan by finely honed judgement.",
    "But most importantly prejudice comes under the cosh.",
    "There are several\ncharacters in The Seven Dials Mystery about whom we are invited to make\nkneejerk judgements from the mysterious East European countess to the\napparently reliable but unimaginative Scotland Yard detective.",
    "All of these\nsnap decisions would fall into line with the received bigotry of the time.",
    "Yet by the end of the novel Christie has forced a reversal of almost all of\nthese positions.",
    "I\u2019m not suggesting that she was actually a secret radical who was aiming\nto subvert the narrowminded intolerance of her time and class.",
    "That would be\npatently absurd for Agatha Christie was no revolutionary.",
    "But she was far less of a hidebound conservative than is generally\nassumed.",
    "There is clearly more to The Seven Dials Mystery than a facile\nattempt to turn everything on its head in order to make the \u201cleast likely\nperson\u201d hypothesis work.",
    "There is I believe clear evidence that Christie saw\nher world with a far clearer and colder eye than those who disparage her\nunderstand.",
    "The Seven Dials Mystery is the perfect antidote to anyone who has\noverdosed on the classic English thriller from between the wars.",
    "But it\u2019s also\nworth reading for the sheer skill with which Christie plays with her readers\u2019\nexpectations and uses them to play the cleverest of narrative tricks with us.",
    "It\u2019s all sleight of hand.",
    "And the quickness of Christie\u2019s hand still continues\nto deceive our eyes all those years later.",
    "OceanofPDF.com\n\n\fOne\nON EARLY RISING\n\nThat amiable youth Jimmy Thesiger came racing down the big staircase at\nChimneys two steps at a time.",
    "So precipitate was his descent that he collided\nwith Tredwell the stately butler just as the latter was crossing the hall\nbearing a fresh supply of hot coffee.",
    "Owing to the marvellous presence of\nmind and masterly agility of Tredwell no casualty occurred.",
    "\u201cSorry\u201d apologized Jimmy.",
    "\u201cI say Tredwell am I the last down\u201d\n\u201cNo sir.",
    "Mr. Wade has not come down yet.\u201d\n\u201cGood\u201d said Jimmy and entered the breakfast room.",
    "The room was empty save for his hostess and her reproachful gaze gave\nJimmy the same feeling of discomfort he always experienced on catching the\neye of a defunct codfish exposed on a fisherman\u2019s slab.",
    "Yet hang it all why\nshould the woman look at him like that To come down at a punctual nine\nthirty when staying in a country house simply wasn\u2019t done.",
    "To be sure it was\nnow a quarter past eleven which was perhaps the outside limit but even then\n\u2014\n\u201cAfraid I\u2019m a bit late Lady Coote.",
    "What\u201d\n\u201cOh it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d said Lady Coote in a melancholy voice.",
    "As a matter of fact people being late for breakfast worried her very much.",
    "For the first ten years of her married life Sir Oswald Coote then plain Mr.\nhad to put it badly raised hell if his morning meal were even a half minute\nlater than eight o\u2019clock.",
    "Lady Coote had been disciplined to regard\nunpunctuality as a deadly sin of the most unpardonable nature.",
    "And habit dies\nhard.",
    "Also she was an earnest woman and she could not help asking herself\nwhat possible good these young people would ever do in the world without\nearly rising.",
    "As Sir Oswald so often said to reporters and others \u201cI attribute\nmy success entirely to my habits of early rising frugal living and methodical\n\n\fhabits.\u201d\nLady Coote was a big handsome woman in a tragic sort of fashion.",
    "She\nhad large mournful eyes and a deep voice.",
    "An artist looking for a model for\n\u201cRachel mourning for her children\u201d would have hailed Lady Coote with\ndelight.",
    "She would have done well too in melodrama staggering through the\nfalling snow as the deeply wronged wife of the villain.",
    "She looked as though she had some terrible secret sorrow in her life and\nyet if the truth be told Lady Coote had had no trouble in her life whatever\nexcept the meteoric rise to prosperity of Sir Oswald.",
    "As a young girl she had\nbeen a jolly flamboyant creature very much in love with Oswald Coote the\naspiring young man in the bicycle shop next to her father\u2019s hardware store.",
    "They had lived very happily first in a couple of rooms and then in a tiny\nhouse and then in a larger house and then in successive houses of increasing\nmagnitude but always within a reasonable distance of \u201cthe Works\u201d until now\nSir Oswald had reached such an eminence that he and \u201cthe Works\u201d were no\nlonger interdependent and it was his pleasure to rent the very largest and\nmost magnificent mansions available all over England.",
    "Chimneys was a\nhistoric place and in renting it from the Marquis of Caterham for two years\nSir Oswald felt that he had attained the top notch of his ambition.",
    "Lady Coote was not nearly so happy about it.",
    "She was a lonely woman.",
    "The principal relaxation of her early married life had been talking to \u201cthe\ngirl\u201d\u2014and even when \u201cthe girl\u201d had been multiplied by three conversation\nwith her domestic staff had still been the principal distraction of Lady Coote\u2019s\nday.",
    "Now with a pack of housemaids a butler like an archbishop several\nfootmen of imposing proportions a bevy of scuttling kitchen and scullery\nmaids a terrifying foreign chef with a \u201ctemperament\u201d and a housekeeper of\nimmense proportions who alternately creaked and rustled when she moved\nLady Coote was as one marooned on a desert island.",
    "She sighed now heavily and drifted out through the open window much\nto the relief of Jimmy Thesiger who at once helped himself to more kidneys\nand bacon on the strength of it.",
    "Lady Coote stood for a few moments tragically on the terrace and then\nnerved herself to speak to MacDonald the head gardener who was surveying\nthe domain over which he ruled with an autocratic eye.",
    "MacDonald was a\nvery chief and prince among head gardeners.",
    "He knew his place\u2014which was\n\n\fto rule.",
    "And he ruled\u2014despotically.",
    "Lady Coote approached him nervously.",
    "\u201cGood morning MacDonald.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning m\u2019lady.\u201d\nHe spoke as head gardeners should speak\u2014mournfully but with dignity\n\u2014like an emperor at a funeral.",
    "\u201cI was wondering\u2014could we have some of those late grapes for dessert\ntonight\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no fit for picking yet\u201d said MacDonald.",
    "He spoke kindly but firmly.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d said Lady Coote.",
    "She plucked up courage.",
    "\u201cOh but I was in the end house yesterday and I tasted one and they\nseemed very good.\u201d\nMacDonald looked at her and she blushed.",
    "She was made to feel that she\nhad taken an unpardonable liberty.",
    "Evidently the late Marchioness of\nCaterham had never committed such a solecism as to enter one of her own\nhothouses and help herself to grapes.",
    "\u201cIf you had given orders m\u2019lady a bunch should have been cut and sent\nin to you\u201d said MacDonald severely.",
    "\u201cOh thank you\u201d said Lady Coote.",
    "\u201cYes I will do that another time.\u201d\n\u201cBut they\u2019re no properly fit for picking yet.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d murmured Lady Coote \u201cno I suppose not.",
    "We\u2019d better leave it\nthen.\u201d\nMacDonald maintained a masterly silence.",
    "Lady Coote nerved herself\nonce more.",
    "\u201cI was going to speak to you about the piece of lawn at the back of the\nrose garden.",
    "I wondered if it could be used as a bowling green.",
    "Sir Oswald is\nvery fond of a game of bowls.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why not\u201d thought Lady Coote to herself.",
    "She had been instructed in\n\n\fher history of England.",
    "Had not Sir Francis Drake and his knightly\ncompanions been playing a game of bowls when the Armada was sighted\nSurely a gentlemanly pursuit and one to which MacDonald could not\nreasonably object.",
    "But she had reckoned without the predominant trait of a\ngood head gardener which is to oppose any and every suggestion made to\nhim.",
    "\u201cNae doot it could be used for that purpose\u201d said MacDonald\nnoncommittally.",
    "He threw a discouraging flavour into the remark but its real object was to\nlure Lady Coote on to her destruction.",
    "\u201cIf it was cleared up and\u2014er\u2014cut\u2014and\u2014er\u2014all that sort of thing\u201d she\nwent on hopefully.",
    "\u201cAye\u201d said MacDonald slowly.",
    "\u201cIt could be done.",
    "But it would mean\ntaking William from the lower border.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said Lady Coote doubtfully.",
    "The words \u201clower border\u201d conveyed\nabsolutely nothing to her mind\u2014except a vague suggestion of a Scottish song\n\u2014but it was clear that to MacDonald they constituted an insuperable\nobjection.",
    "\u201cAnd that would be a pity\u201d said MacDonald.",
    "\u201cOh of course\u201d said Lady Coote.",
    "\u201cIt would.\u201d And wondered why she\nagreed so fervently.",
    "MacDonald looked at her very hard.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d he said \u201cif it\u2019s your orders m\u2019lady\u2014\u201d\nHe left it like that.",
    "But his menacing tone was too much for Lady Coote.",
    "She capitulated at once.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI see what you mean MacDonald.",
    "N\u2014no\u2014William\nhad better get on with the lower border.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thocht meself m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Lady Coote.",
    "\u201cYes certainly.\u201d\n\u201cI thocht you\u2019d agree m\u2019lady\u201d said MacDonald.",
    "\u201cOh certainly\u201d said Lady Coote again.",
    "MacDonald touched his hat and moved away.",
    "Lady Coote sighed unhappily and looked after him.",
    "Jimmy Thesiger\nreplete with kidneys and bacon stepped out on to the terrace beside her and\nsighed in quite a different manner.",
    "\u201cTopping morning eh\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cIs it\u201d said Lady Coote absently.",
    "\u201cOh yes I suppose it is.",
    "I hadn\u2019t\nnoticed.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are the others Punting on the lake\u201d\n\u201cI expect so.",
    "I mean I shouldn\u2019t wonder if they were.\u201d\nLady Coote turned and plunged abruptly into the house again.",
    "Tredwell\nwas just examining the coffee pot.",
    "\u201cOh dear\u201d said Lady Coote.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWade m\u2019lady\u201d\n\u201cYes Mr. Wade.",
    "Isn\u2019t he down yet\u201d\n\u201cNo m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very late.\u201d\n\u201cYes m\u2019lady.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear.",
    "I suppose he will come down sometime Tredwell\u201d\n\u201cOh undoubtedly m\u2019lady.",
    "It was eleven thirty yesterday morning when\nMr. Wade came down m\u2019lady.\u201d\nLady Coote glanced at the clock.",
    "It was now twenty minutes to twelve.",
    "A\nwave of human sympathy rushed over her.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard luck on you Tredwell.",
    "Having to clear and then get lunch\non the table by one o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\u201cI am accustomed to the ways of young gentlemen m\u2019lady.\u201d\nThe reproof was dignified but unmistakable.",
    "So might a prince of the\nChurch reprove a Turk or an infidel who had unwittingly committed a\nsolecism in all good faith.",
    "Lady Coote blushed for the second time that morning.",
    "But a welcome\ninterruption occurred.",
    "The door opened and a serious spectacled young man\n\n\fput his head in.",
    "\u201cOh there you are Lady Coote.",
    "Sir Oswald was asking for you.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll go to him at once Mr. Bateman.\u201d\nLady Coote hurried out.",
    "Rupert Bateman who was Sir Oswald\u2019s private secretary went out the\nother way through the window where Jimmy Thesiger was still lounging\namiably.",
    "\u201c \u2019Morning Pongo\u201d said Jimmy.",
    "\u201cI suppose I shall have to go and make\nmyself agreeable to those blasted girls.",
    "You coming\u201d\nBateman shook his head and hurried along the terrace and in at the library\nwindow.",
    "Jimmy grinned pleasantly at his retreating back.",
    "He and Bateman\nhad been at school together when Bateman had been a serious spectacled\nboy and had been nicknamed Pongo for no earthly reason whatever.",
    "Pongo Jimmy reflected was very much the same sort of ass now that he\nhad been then.",
    "The words \u201cLife is real life is earnest\u201d might have been\nwritten specially for him.",
    "Jimmy yawned and strolled slowly down to the lake.",
    "The girls were there\nthree of them\u2014just the usual sort of girls two with dark shingled heads and\none with a fair shingled head.",
    "The one that giggled most was he thought\ncalled Helen\u2014and there was another called Nancy\u2014and the third one was\nfor some reason addressed as Socks.",
    "With them were his two friends Bill\nEversleigh and Ronny Devereux who were employed in a purely ornamental\ncapacity at the Foreign Office.",
    "\u201cHallo\u201d said Nancy or possibly Helen.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s Jimmy.",
    "Where\u2019s what\u2019s his\nname\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say\u201d said Bill Eversleigh \u201cthat Gerry Wade\u2019s not up\nyet Something ought to be done about it.\u201d\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not careful\u201d said Ronny Devereux \u201che\u2019ll miss his breakfast\naltogether one day\u2014find it\u2019s lunch or tea instead when he rolls down.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame\u201d said the girl called Socks.",
    "\u201cBecause it worries Lady Coote\nso.",
    "She gets more and more like a hen that wants to lay an egg and can\u2019t.",
    "It\u2019s\ntoo bad.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cLet\u2019s pull him out of bed\u201d suggested Bill.",
    "\u201cCome on Jimmy.\u201d\n\u201cOh let\u2019s be more subtle than that\u201d said the girl called Socks.",
    "Subtle was\na word of which she was rather fond.",
    "She used it a great deal.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not subtle\u201d said Jimmy.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s get together and do something about it tomorrow morning\u201d\nsuggested Ronny vaguely.",
    "\u201cYou know get him up at seven.",
    "Stagger the\nhousehold.",
    "Tredwell loses his false whiskers and drops the tea urn.",
    "Lady\nCoote has hysterics and faints in Bill\u2019s arms\u2014Bill being the weight carrier.",
    "Sir Oswald says \u2018Ha\u2019 and steel goes up a point and five eighths.",
    "Pongo\nregisters emotion by throwing down his spectacles and stamping on them.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know Gerry\u201d said Jimmy.",
    "\u201cI daresay enough cold water might\nwake him\u2014judiciously applied that is.",
    "But he\u2019d only turn over and go to\nsleep again.\u201d\n\u201cOh we must think of something more subtle than cold water\u201d said\nSocks.",
    "\u201cWell what\u201d asked Ronny bluntly.",
    "And nobody had any answer ready.",
    "\u201cWe ought to be able to think of something\u201d said Bill.",
    "\u201cWho\u2019s got any\nbrains\u201d\n\u201cPongo\u201d said Jimmy.",
    "\u201cAnd here he is rushing along in a harried manner\nas usual.",
    "Pongo was always the one for brains.",
    "It\u2019s been his misfortune from\nhis youth upwards.",
    "Let\u2019s turn Pongo on to it.\u201d\nMr. Bateman listened patiently to a somewhat incoherent statement.",
    "His\nattitude was that of one poised for flight.",
    "He delivered his solution without\nloss of time.",
    "\u201cI should suggest an alarum clock\u201d he said briskly.",
    "\u201cI always use one\nmyself for fear of oversleeping.",
    "I find that early tea brought in in a noiseless\nmanner is sometimes powerless to awaken one.\u201d\nHe hurried away.",
    "\u201cAn alarum clock.\u201d Ronny shook his head.",
    "\u201cOne alarum clock.",
    "It would\ntake about a dozen to disturb Gerry Wade.\u201d\n\u201cWell why not\u201d Bill was flushed and earnest.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got it.",
    "Let\u2019s all go\ninto Market Basing and buy an alarum clock each.\u201d\n\n\fThere was laughter and discussion.",
    "Bill and Ronny went off to get hold of\ncars.",
    "Jimmy was deputed to spy upon the dining room.",
    "He returned rapidly.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s here right enough.",
    "Making up for lost time and wolfing down toast\nand marmalade.",
    "How are we going to prevent him coming along with us\u201d\nIt was decided that Lady Coote must be approached and instructed to hold\nhim in play.",

    "The hum of voices\nwhich had come to her for a minute or two rather like the faroff roar of sea\nwaves ceased as suddenly as it had begun and Bundle heard the sound of a\nbolt being shot.",
    "Clearly someone had come in from the gaming room next\ndoor and she paid tribute to the thoroughness with which the communicating\ndoor had been rendered soundproof.",
    "In another minute the intruder came into her line of vision\u2014a line of\nvision that was necessarily somewhat incomplete but which yet answered its\npurpose.",
    "A tall man broadshouldered and powerful looking with a long\nblack beard Bundle remembered having seen him sitting at one of the\nbaccarat tables on the preceding night.",
    "This then was Alfred\u2019s mysterious Russian gentleman the proprietor of\nthe club the sinister Mr. Mosgorovsky.",
    "Bundle\u2019s heart beat faster with\nexcitement.",
    "So little did she resemble her father that at this minute she fairly\ngloried in the extreme discomfort of her position.",
    "The Russian remained for some minutes standing by the table stroking\nhis beard.",
    "Then he drew a watch from his pocket and glanced at the time.",
    "Nodding his head as though satisfied he again thrust his hand into his pocket\nand pulling out something that Bundle could not see he moved out of the\n\n\fline of vision.",
    "When he reappeared she could hardly help giving a gasp of surprise.",
    "His face was now covered by a mask\u2014but hardly a mask in the\nconventional sense.",
    "It was not shaped to the face.",
    "It was a mere piece of\nmaterial hanging in front of the features like a curtain in which two slits were\npierced for the eyes.",
    "In shape it was round and on it was the representation of\na clock face with the hands pointing to six o\u2019clock.",
    "\u201cThe Seven Dials\u201d said Bundle to herself.",
    "And at that minute there came a new sound\u2014seven muffled taps.",
    "Mosgorovsky strode across to where Bundle knew was the other cupboard\ndoor.",
    "She heard a sharp click and then the sound of greetings in a foreign\ntongue.",
    "Presently she had a view of the newcomers.",
    "They also wore clock masks but in their case the hands were in a different\nposition\u2014four o\u2019clock and five o\u2019clock respectively.",
    "Both men were in\nevening dress\u2014but with a difference.",
    "One was an elegant slender young man\nwearing evening clothes of exquisite cut.",
    "The grace with which he moved was\nforeign rather than English.",
    "The other man could be better described as wiry\nand lean.",
    "His clothes fitted him sufficiently well but no more and Bundle\nguessed at his nationality even before she heard his voice.",
    "\u201cI reckon we\u2019re the first to arrive at this little meeting.\u201d\nA full pleasant voice with a slight American drawl and an inflection of\nIrish behind it.",
    "The elegant young man said in good but slightly stilted English\n\u201cI had much difficulty in getting away tonight.",
    "These things do not always\narrange themselves fortunately.",
    "I am not like No 4 here my own master.\u201d\nBundle tried to guess at his nationality.",
    "Until he spoke she had thought he\nmight be French but the accent was not a French one.",
    "He might possibly she\nthought be an Austrian or a Hungarian or even a Russian.",
    "The American moved to the other side of the table and Bundle heard a\nchair being pulled out.",
    "\u201cOne o\u2019clock\u2019s being a great success\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI congratulate you on\ntaking the risk.\u201d\nFive o\u2019clock shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cUnless one takes risks\u2014\u201d He left the sentence unfinished.",
    "Again seven taps sounded and Mosgorovsky moved across to the secret\ndoor.",
    "She failed to catch anything definite for some moments since the whole\ncompany were out of sight but presently she heard the bearded Russian\u2019s\nvoice upraised.",
    "\u201cShall we begin proceedings\u201d\nHe himself came round the table and took the seat next to the armchair at\nthe top.",
    "Sitting thus he was directly facing Bundle\u2019s cupboard.",
    "The elegant\nfive o\u2019clock took the place next to him.",
    "The third chair that side was out of\nBundle\u2019s sight but the American No 4 moved into her line of vision for a\nmoment or two before he sat down.",
    "On the near side of the table also only two chairs were visible and as she\nwatched a hand turned the second\u2014really the middle chair\u2014down.",
    "And then\nwith a swift movement one of the newcomers brushed past the cupboard and\ntook the chair opposite Mosgorovsky.",
    "Whoever sat there had of course their\nback directly turned to Bundle\u2014and it was at that back that Bundle was\nstaring with a good deal of interest for it was the back of a singularly\nbeautiful woman very much d\u00e9collet\u00e9.",
    "It was she who spoke first.",
    "Her voice was musical foreign\u2014with a deep\nseductive note in it.",
    "She was glancing towards the empty chair at the head of\nthe table.",
    "\u201cSo we are not to see No 7 tonight\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cTell me my friends shall\nwe ever see him\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s darned good\u201d said the American.",
    "\u201cDarned good As for seven\no\u2019clock\u2014I\u2019m beginning to believe there is no such person.\u201d\n\u201cI should not advise you to think that my friend\u201d said the Russian\npleasantly.",
    "There was a silence\u2014rather an uncomfortable silence Bundle felt.",
    "She was still staring as though fascinated at the beautiful back in front of\nher.",
    "There was a tiny black mole just below the right shoulder blade that\nenhanced the whiteness of the skin.",
    "Bundle felt that at last the term \u201cbeautiful\nadventuress\u201d so often read had a real meaning for her.",
    "She was quite certain\nthat this woman had a beautiful face\u2014a dark Slavonic face with passionate\neyes.",
    "She was recalled from her imagining by the voice of the Russian who\nseemed to act as master of ceremonies.",
    "\u201cShall we get on with our business First to our absent comrade No 2\u201d\nHe made a curious gesture with his hand towards the turned down chair\nnext to the woman which everyone present imitated turning to the chair as\nthey did so.",
    "\u201cI wish No 2 were with us tonight\u201d he continued.",
    "\u201cThere are many things\nto be done.",
    "Unsuspected difficulties have arisen.\u201d\n\u201cHave you had his report\u201d It was the American who spoke.",
    "\u201cAs yet\u2014I have nothing from him.\u201d There was a pause.",
    "\u201cI cannot\nunderstand it.\u201d\n\u201cYou think it may have\u2014gone astray\u201d\n\u201cThat is\u2014a possibility.\u201d\n\u201cIn other words\u201d said five o\u2019clock softly \u201cthere is\u2014danger.\u201d\nHe spoke the word delicately\u2014and yet with relish.",
    "The Russian nodded emphatically.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014there\u2019s danger.",
    "Too much is getting known about us\u2014about this\nplace.",
    "I know of several people who suspect.\u201d He added coldly \u201cThey must\nbe silenced.\u201d\nBundle felt a little cold shiver pass down her spine.",
    "If she were to be\nfound would she be silenced She was recalled suddenly to attention by a\nword.",
    "\u201cSo nothing has come to light about Chimneys\u201d\nMosgorovsky shook his head.",
    "\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\fSuddenly No 5 leant forward.",
    "\u201cI agree with Anna where is our president\u2014No 7 He who called us into\nbeing.",
    "Why do we never see him\u201d\n\u201cNo 7\u201d said the Russian \u201chas his own ways of working.\u201d\n\u201cSo you always say.\u201d\n\u201cI will say no more\u201d said Mosgorovsky.",
    "\u201cI pity the man\u2014or woman\u2014\nwho comes up against him.\u201d\nThere was an awkward silence.",
    "\u201cWe must get on with our business\u201d said Mosgorovsky quietly.",
    "\u201cNo 3\nyou have the plans of Wyvern Abbey\u201d\nBundle strained her ears.",
    "So far she had neither caught a glimpse of No 3\nnor had she heard his voice.",
    "She heard it now and recognized it as\nunmistakable.",
    "Low pleasant indistinct\u2014the voice of a wellbred\nEnglishman.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got them here sir.\u201d\nSome papers were shoved across the table.",
    "Everyone bent forward.",
    "Presently Mosgorovsky raised his head again.",
    "\u201cAnd the list of guests\u201d\n\u201cHere.\u201d\nThe Russian read them.",
    "\u201cSir Stanley Digby.",
    "Mr. Terence O\u2019Rourke.",
    "Sir Oswald and Lady Coote.",
    "Mr. Bateman.",
    "Countess Anna Radzky.",
    "Mrs. Macatta.",
    "Mr. James Thesiger\u2014\u201d\nHe paused and then asked sharply\n\u201cWho is Mr. James Thesiger\u201d\nThe American laughed.",
    "\u201cI guess you needn\u2019t worry any about him.",
    "The usual complete young\nass.\u201d\nThe Russian continued reading.",
    "\u201cHerr Eberhard and Mr. Eversleigh.",
    "That completes the list.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it\u201d said Bundle silently.",
    "\u201cWhat about that sweet girl Lady Eileen\n\n\fBrent\u201d\n\u201cYes there seems nothing to worry about there\u201d said Mosgorovsky.",
    "He\nlooked across the table.",
    "\u201cI suppose there\u2019s no doubt whatever about the value\nof Eberhard\u2019s invention\u201d\nThree o\u2019clock made a laconic British reply.",
    "\u201cNone whatever.\u201d\n\u201cCommercially it should be worth millions\u201d said the Russian.",
    "\u201cAnd\ninternationally\u2014well one knows only too well the greed of nations.\u201d\nBundle had an idea that behind his mask he was smiling unpleasantly.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he went on.",
    "\u201cA gold mine.\u201d\n\u201cWell worth a few lives\u201d said No 5 cynically and laughed.",
    "\u201cBut you know what inventors are\u201d said the American.",
    "\u201cSometimes these\ndarned things won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cA man like Sir Oswald Coote will have made no mistake\u201d said\nMosgorovsky.",
    "\u201cSpeaking as an aviator myself\u201d said No 5 \u201cthe thing is perfectly\nfeasible.",
    "It has been discussed for years\u2014but it needed the genius of Eberhard\nto bring it to fruition.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Mosgorovsky \u201cI don\u2019t think we need discuss matters any\nfurther.",
    "You have all seen the plans.",
    "I do not think our original scheme can be\nbettered.",
    "By the way I hear something about a letter of Gerald Wade\u2019s that\nhas been found\u2014a letter that mentions this organization.",
    "Who found it\u201d\n\u201cLord Caterham\u2019s daughter\u2014Lady Eileen Brent.\u201d\n\u201cBauer should have been on to that\u201d said Mosgorovsky.",
    "\u201cIt was careless\nof him.",
    "Who was the letter written to\u201d\n\u201cHis sister I believe\u201d said No 3.",
    "\u201cUnfortunate\u201d said Mosgorovsky.",

    "I suppose that has been arranged for\u201d\n\u201cReports as to local lads having been practising with rifles have been\nspread everywhere\u201d said the American.",
    "\u201cThat should be all right then.",
    "I think there is nothing further to be said.",
    "I\nthink we must all congratulate our dear one o\u2019clock and wish her luck in the\npart she has to play.\u201d\n\u201cHurrah\u201d cried No 5.",
    "\u201cTo Anna\u201d\nAll hands flew out in the same gesture which Bundle had noticed before.",
    "\u201cTo Anna\u201d\nOne o\u2019clock acknowledged the salutation with a typically foreign gesture.",
    "Then she rose to her feet and the others followed suit.",
    "For the first time\nBundle caught a glimpse of No 3 as he came to put Anna\u2019s cloak round her\u2014\na tall heavily built man.",
    "Then the party filed out through the secret door.",
    "Mosgorovsky secured it\nafter them.",
    "He waited a few moments and then Bundle heard him unbolt the\nother door and pass through after extinguishing the electric light.",
    "It was not until two hours later that a white and anxious Alfred came to\nrelease Bundle.",
    "She almost fell into his arms and he had to hold her up.",
    "\u201cNothing\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cJust stiff that\u2019s all.",
    "Here let me sit down.\u201d\n\u201cOh Gord my lady it\u2019s been awful.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense\u201d said Bundle.",

    "In this life Alfred one never stops\nlearning.\u201d\nOceanofPDF.com\n\n\fFifteen\nTHE INQUEST\n\nBundle reached home about six a.m. She was up and dressed by half past\nnine and rang up Jimmy Thesiger on the telephone.",
    "The promptitude of his reply somewhat surprised her till he explained\nthat he was going down to attend the inquest.",
    "\u201cSo am I\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a lot to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cWell suppose you let me drive you down and we can talk on the way.",
    "How about that\u201d\n\u201cAll right.",
    "But allow a bit extra because you\u2019ll have to take me to\nChimneys.",
    "The Chief Constable\u2019s picking me up there.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a kind man\u201d said Bundle.",

    "It was\u2014\u201d\nBut an indignant protest drowned her words.",
    "\u201cI may be an ass\u201d said Jimmy.",
    "\u201cI daresay I am\u2014but I won\u2019t have Russian\nJews saying so.",

    "\u201cGoodbye for the\nmoment.\u201d\nShe rang off in a tantalizing manner which left Jimmy pleasantly puzzled.",
    "He had the highest respect for Bundle\u2019s capabilities though there was not the\nslightest trace of sentiment in his feeling towards her.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s been up to something\u201d he opined as he took a last hasty drink of\ncoffee.",
    "\u201cDepend upon it she\u2019s been up to something.\u201d\nTwenty minutes later his little twoseater drew up before the Brook Street\nhouse and Bundle who had been waiting came tripping down the steps.",
    "Jimmy was not ordinarily an observant young man but he noticed that there\nwere black rings round Bundle\u2019s eyes and that she had all the appearance of\nhaving had a late night the night before.",
    "\u201cNow then\u201d he said as the car began to nose her way through the\nsuburbs \u201cwhat dark deeds have you been up to\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cBut don\u2019t interrupt until I\u2019ve finished.\u201d\nIt was a somewhat long story and Jimmy had all he could do to keep\nsufficient attention on the car to prevent an accident.",

    "\u201cBundle\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cLook here you\u2019re not pulling my leg\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d apologized Jimmy \u201cbut it seems to me as though I\u2019d heard it\nall before\u2014in a dream you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u201d said Bundle sympathetically.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible\u201d said Jimmy following out his own train of thought.",

    "No 2 is Bauer\u2014our footman.",
    "That seems to me quite\nclear from what they said about expecting a report which hadn\u2019t come in\u2014\nthough what there can be to report about Chimneys I can\u2019t think.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be something to do with Gerry Wade\u2019s death\u201d said Jimmy.",

    "I can\u2019t put the thing properly because I haven\u2019t got the scientific knowledge\u2014\nbut I know the result was that it became so toughened that a wire was as\nstrong as a steel bar had previously been.",
    "Eberhard had to do with aeroplanes\nand his idea was that the weight would be so enormously reduced that flying\nwould be practically revolutionized\u2014the cost of it I mean.",
    "I believe he\noffered his invention to the German Government and they turned it down\npointed out some undeniable flaw in it\u2014but they did it rather nastily.",

    "\u201cAnd now if you please\u201d said Sir Oswald \u201cI should like to hear exactly\nwhat occurred.\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle gave a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the events of the night.",

    "Superintendent Battle looked slowly around him.",
    "His glance was arrested\nby a big screen of Spanish leather which stood near one of the bookcases.",

    "\u201cOh it doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "I\u2019ve been able to reconstruct things.",
    "There were\nyour footprints you see leading up from the bottom of the garden and a\nplace where you had obviously stopped and stooped down and a kind of dent\nin the grass which was highly suggestive.",
    "By the way what was your theory\nof the pistol being there\u201d\n\u201cI presumed that it had been dropped by the man in his flight.\u201d\nBattle shook his head.",
    "\u201cNot dropped.",

    "There are two points against that.",
    "To begin\nwith there are only one set of footprints crossing the lawn just there\u2014your\nown.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Sir Oswald thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cCan you be sure of that Battle\u201d put in George.",
    "\u201cQuite sure sir.",
    "There is one other set of tracks crossing the lawn Miss\nWade\u2019s but they are a good deal further to the left.\u201d\nHe paused and then went on \u201cAnd there\u2019s the dent in the ground.",
    "The\npistol must have struck the ground with some force.",
    "It all points to its having\nbeen thrown.\u201d\n\u201cWell why not\u201d said Sir Oswald.",
    "\u201cSay the man fled down the path to the\nleft.",
    "He\u2019d leave no footprints on the path and he\u2019d hurl the pistol away from\nhim into the middle of the lawn eh Lomax\u201d\nGeorge agreed by a nod of the head.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019d leave no footprints on the path\u201d said Battle \u201cbut from\nthe shape of the dent and the way the turf was cut I don\u2019t think the pistol was\nthrown from that direction.",
    "I think it was thrown from the terrace here.\u201d\n\u201cVery likely\u201d said Sir Oswald.",
    "\u201cDoes it matter Superintendent\u201d\n\u201cAh yes Battle\u201d broke in George.",
    "\u201cIs it\u2014er\u2014strictly relevant\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps not Mr. Lomax.",

    "Will\nyou Sir Oswald That\u2019s very kind.",
    "Stand just there in the window.",
    "Now fling\nit into the middle of the lawn.\u201d\nSir Oswald complied sending the pistol flying through the air with a\npowerful sweep of his arm.",
    "Jimmy Thesiger drew near with breathless\ninterest.",
    "The Superintendent lumbered off after it like a welltrained retriever.",
    "He reappeared with a beaming face.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s it sir.",
    "Just the same kind of mark.",
    "Although by the way you sent\nit a good ten yards farther.",
    "But then you\u2019re a very powerfully built man\naren\u2019t you Sir Oswald Excuse me I thought I heard someone at the door.\u201d\nThe Superintendent\u2019s ears must have been very much sharper than anyone\nelse\u2019s.",

    "\u201cYou\u2019re just like a naughty little boy.",
    "Drink it up now.\u201d\nAnd meekly obediently the great steel magnate drank it up\nLady Coote smiled sadly and sweetly at everyone.",
    "\u201cAm I interrupting you Are you very busy Oh look at those revolvers.",
    "Nasty noisy murdering things.",
    "To think Oswald that you might have been\nshot by the burglar last night.\u201d\n\u201cYou must have been alarmed when you found he was missing Lady\nCoote\u201d said Battle.",

    "\u201cThis poor boy\nhere\u201d\u2014she indicated Jimmy\u2014\u201cbeing shot\u2014and everything so dreadful but\nso exciting.",

    "\u201cI am usually an excellent sleeper\u201d said Sir Oswald.",
    "\u201cBut I must confess\nthat last night I felt unusually restless.",
    "I thought the night air would do me\ngood.\u201d\n\u201cYou came out through this window I suppose\u201d\nWas it his fancy or did Sir Oswald hesitate for a moment before replying\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIn your pumps too\u201d said Lady Coote \u201cinstead of putting thick shoes on.",
    "What would you do without me to look after you\u201d\nShe shook her head sadly.",
    "\u201cI think Maria if you don\u2019t mind leaving us\u2014we have still a lot to\ndiscuss.\u201d\n\u201cI know dear I\u2019m just going.\u201d\nLady Coote withdrew carrying the empty medicine glass as though it\nwere a goblet out of which she had just administered a death potion.",
    "\u201cWell Battle\u201d said George Lomax \u201cit all seems clear enough.",
    "Yes\nperfectly clear.",
    "The man fires a shot disabling Mr. Thesiger flings away the\nweapon runs along the terrace and down the gravel path.\u201d\n\u201cWhere he ought to have been caught by my men\u201d put in Battle.",
    "\u201cYour men if I may say so Battle seem to have been singularly remiss.",
    "They didn\u2019t see Miss Wade come in.",
    "If they could miss her coming in they\ncould easily miss the thief going out.\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle opened his mouth to speak then seemed to think\nbetter of it.",

    "I was round the corner of the terrace myself\nnot fifty seconds after the shot was fired.",

    "You have some idea of your own\nwhich I have not yet\u2014er\u2014grasped.",
    "You say the man did not go across the\nlawn and now you hint\u2014What exactly do you hint That the man did not go\ndown the path Then in your opinion\u2014er\u2014where did he go\u201d\nFor answer Superintendent Battle jerked an eloquent thumb upwards.",
    "\u201cEh\u201d said George.",
    "The Superintendent jerked harder than ever.",
    "George raised his head and\nlooked at the ceiling.",
    "\u201cUp there\u201d said Battle.",

    "That was when our friend was up there the first time.",
    "I suspect the key was under Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pillow.",

    "He sat quite immovable and Bundle got an odd sensation of power\nradiating from him.",
    "His inactivity was not the inactivity of weakness\u2014and\nshe wished violently almost hysterically that he would speak\u2014that he would\nmake some sign some gesture\u2014not just sit there like a gigantic spider in the\nmiddle of its web waiting remorselessly for its prey.",
    "She shivered and as she did so Mosgorovsky rose.",

    "\u201cDo not answer precipitately.\u201d\nShe fancied that Mosgorovsky beneath his clock mask was smiling\nsignificantly into his beard.",
    "\u201cYou do not as yet know Lady Eileen what it is you are refusing.\u201d\n\u201cI can make a pretty good guess\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cCan you\u201d\nIt was the voice of 7 o\u2019clock.",
    "It awoke some vague chord of memory in\nBundle\u2019s brain.",
    "Surely she knew that voice\nVery slowly No 7 raised a hand to his head and fumbled with the fastening\nof the mask.",

    "His name is Mr. Jimmy Thesiger\nand he was arrested this afternoon.\u201d\nOceanofPDF.com\n\n\fThirtythree\nBATTLE EXPLAINS\n\nSuperintendent Battle settled down to explain.",
    "He spoke comfortably and\ncosily.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t suspect him myself for a long time.",
    "The first hint of it I had was\nwhen I heard what Mr. Devereux\u2019s last words had been.",
    "Naturally you took\nthem to mean that Mr. Devereux was trying to send word to Mr. Thesiger that\nthe Seven Dials had killed him.",
    "That\u2019s what the words seemed to mean on\ntheir face value.",
    "But of course I knew that that couldn\u2019t be so.",
    "It was the\nSeven Dials that Mr. Devereux wanted told\u2014and what he wanted them told\nwas something about Mr. Jimmy Thesiger.",
    "\u201cThe thing seemed incredible because Mr. Devereux and Mr. Thesiger\nwere close friends.",
    "But I remembered something else\u2014that these thefts must\nhave been committed by someone who was absolutely in the know.",
    "Someone\nwho if not in the Foreign Office himself was in the way of hearing all its\nchitchat.",
    "And I found it very hard to find out where Mr. Thesiger got his\nmoney.",
    "The income his father left him was a small one yet he was able to live\nat a most expensive rate.",
    "Where did the money come from\n\u201cI knew that Mr. Wade had been very excited by something that he had\nfound out.",
    "He was quite sure that he was on the right track.",
    "He didn\u2019t confide\nin anyone about what he thought that track was but he did say something to\nMr. Devereux about being on the point of making sure.",
    "That was just before\nthey both went down to Chimneys for that weekend.",
    "As you know Mr. Wade\ndied there\u2014apparently from an overdose of a sleeping draught.",
    "It seemed\nstraightforward enough but Mr. Devereux did not accept that explanation for\na minute.",
    "He was convinced that Mr. Wade had been very cleverly put out of\nthe way and that someone in the house must actually be the criminal we were\nall after.",
    "He came I think very near confiding in Mr. Thesiger for he\ncertainly had no suspicions of him at that moment.",
    "But something held him\nback.",
    "\u201cThen he did a rather curious thing.",
    "He arranged seven clocks upon the\nmantelpiece throwing away the eighth.",
    "It was meant as a symbol that the\nSeven Dials would revenge the death of one of their members\u2014and he\nwatched eagerly to see if anyone betrayed themselves or showed signs of\nperturbation.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it was Jimmy Thesiger who poisoned Gerry Wade\u201d\n\u201cYes he slipped the stuff into a whisky and soda which Mr. Wade had\ndownstairs before retiring to bed.",
    "That\u2019s why he was already feeling sleepy\nwhen he wrote that letter to Miss Wade.\u201d\n\u201cThen the footman Bauer hadn\u2019t anything to do with it\u201d asked Bundle.",
    "\u201cBauer was one of our people Lady Eileen.",
    "It was thought likely that our\ncrook would go for Herr Eberhard\u2019s invention and Bauer was got into the\nhouse to watch events on our behalf.",
    "But he wasn\u2019t able to do much.",
    "As I say\nMr. Thesiger administered the fatal dose easily enough.",
    "Later when everyone\nwas asleep a bottle glass and empty chloral bottle were placed by Mr.\nWade\u2019s bedside by Mr. Thesiger.",
    "Mr. Wade was unconscious then and his\nfingers were probably pressed round the glass and the bottle so that they\nshould be found there if any questions should arise.",
    "I don\u2019t know what effect\nthe seven clocks on the mantelpiece made on Mr. Thesiger.",
    "He certainly\ndidn\u2019t let on anything to Mr. Devereux.",
    "All the same I think he had a bad five\nminutes now and again thinking of them.",
    "And I think he kept a pretty wary\neye on Mr. Devereux after that.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what happened next.",
    "No one saw much of Mr.\nDevereux after Mr. Wade\u2019s death.",
    "But it is clear that he worked along the\nsame lines that he knew Mr. Wade had been working on and reached the same\nresult\u2014namely that Mr. Thesiger was the man.",
    "I fancy too that he was\nbetrayed in the same way.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u201d\n\u201cThrough Miss Loraine Wade.",
    "Mr. Wade was devoted to her\u2014I believe he\nhoped to marry her\u2014she wasn\u2019t really his sister of course\u2014and there is no\ndoubt that he told her more than he should have done.",
    "But Miss Loraine Wade\nwas devoted body and soul to Mr. Thesiger.",
    "She would do anything he told\nher.",
    "She passed on the information to him.",
    "In the same way later Mr.\nDevereux was attracted to her and probably warned her against Mr. Thesiger.",
    "So Mr. Devereux in turn was silenced\u2014and died trying to send word to the\nSeven Dials that his murderer was Mr. Thesiger.\u201d\n\u201cHow ghastly\u201d cried Bundle.",
    "\u201cIf I had only known.\u201d\n\u201cWell it didn\u2019t seem likely.",
    "In fact I could hardly credit it myself.",
    "But\nthen we came to the affair at the Abbey.",
    "You will remember how awkward it\nwas\u2014specially awkward for Mr. Eversleigh here.",
    "You and Mr. Thesiger were\nhand in glove.",
    "Mr. Eversleigh had already been embarrassed by your insisting\non being brought to this place and when he found that you had actually\noverheard what went on at a meeting he was dumbfounded.\u201d\nThe Superintendent paused and a twinkle came into his eye.",
    "\u201cSo was I Lady Eileen.",
    "I never dreamed of such a thing being possible.",
    "You put one over on me there all right.",
    "\u201cWell Mr. Eversleigh was in a dilemma.",
    "He couldn\u2019t let you into the\nsecret of the Seven Dials without letting Mr. Thesiger in also\u2014and that would\nnever do.",
    "It all suited Mr. Thesiger very well of course for it gave him a\nbona fide reason for getting himself asked to the Abbey which made things\neasier for him.",
    "\u201cI may say that the Seven Dials had already sent a warning letter to Mr.\nLomax.",
    "That was to ensure his applying to me for assistance so that I should\nbe able to be on the spot in a perfectly natural manner.",
    "I made no secret of my\npresence as you know.\u201d\nAnd again the Superintendent\u2019s eye twinkled.",
    "\u201cWell ostensibly Mr. Eversleigh and Mr. Thesiger were to divide the\nnight into two watches.",
    "Really Mr. Eversleigh and Miss St. Maur did so.",
    "She\nwas on guard at the library window when she heard Mr. Thesiger coming and\nhad to dart behind the screen.",
    "\u201cAnd now comes the cleverness of Mr. Thesiger.",
    "Up to a point he told me\na perfectly true story and I must admit that with the fight and everything I\nwas distinctly shaken\u2014and began to wonder whether he had had anything to\ndo with the theft at all or whether we were completely on the wrong track.",
    "There were one or two suspicious circumstances that pointed in an entirely\ndifferent direction and I can tell you I didn\u2019t know what to make of things\nwhen something turned up to clinch matters.",
    "\u201cI found the burnt glove in the fireplace with the teeth marks on it\u2014and\nthen\u2014well\u2014I knew that I\u2019d been right after all.",
    "But upon my word he was a\nclever one.\u201d\n\u201cWhat actually happened\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cWho was the other man\u201d\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any other man.",
    "Listen and I\u2019ll show you how in the end I\nreconstructed the whole story.",
    "To begin with Mr. Thesiger and Miss Wade\nwere in this together.",
    "And they have a rendezvous for an exact time.",
    "Miss\nWade comes over in her car climbs through the fence and comes up to the\nhouse.",
    "She\u2019s got a perfectly good story if anyone stops her\u2014the one she told\neventually.",
    "But she arrived unmolested on the terrace just after the clock had\nstruck two.",
    "\u201cNow I may say to begin with that she was seen coming in.",
    "My men saw\nher but they had orders to stop nobody coming in\u2014only going out.",
    "I wanted\nyou see to find out as much as possible.",
    "Miss Wade arrives on the terrace\nand at that minute a parcel falls at her feet and she picks it up.",
    "A man comes\ndown the ivy and she starts to run.",
    "What happens next The struggle\u2014and\npresently the revolver shots.",
    "What will everyone do Rush to the scene of the\nfight.",
    "And Miss Loraine Wade could have left the grounds and driven off with\nthe formula safely in her possession.",
    "\u201cBut things don\u2019t happen quite like that.",
    "Miss Wade runs straight into my\narms.",
    "And at that moment the game changes.",
    "It\u2019s no longer attack but\ndefence.",
    "Miss Wade tells her story.",
    "It is perfectly true and perfectly sensible.",
    "\u201cAnd now we come to Mr. Thesiger.",
    "One thing struck me at once.",
    "The\nbullet wound alone couldn\u2019t have caused him to faint.",
    "Either he had fallen and\nhit his head\u2014or\u2014well he hadn\u2019t fainted at all.",
    "Later we had Miss St. Maur\u2019s\nstory.",
    "It agreed perfectly with Mr. Thesiger\u2019s\u2014there was only one suggestive\npoint.",
    "Miss St. Maur said that after the lights were turned out and Mr.\nThesiger went over to the window he was so still that she thought he must\nhave left the room and gone outside.",
    "Now if anyone is in the room you can\nhardly help hearing their breathing if you are listening for it.",
    "Supposing then\nthat Mr. Thesiger had gone outside.",
    "Where next Up the ivy to Mr.\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s room\u2014Mr.",
    "O\u2019Rourke\u2019s whisky and soda having been doped the\nnight before.",
    "He gets the papers throws them down to the girl climbs down\nthe ivy again and\u2014starts the fight.",
    "That\u2019s easy enough when you come to\nthink of it.",
    "Knock the tables down stagger about speak in your own voice\n\n\fand then in a hoarse half whisper.",
    "And then the final touch the two revolver\nshots.",
    "His own Colt automatic bought openly the day before is fired at an\nimaginary assailant.",
    "Then with his left gloved hand he takes from his pocket\nthe small Mauser pistol and shoots himself through the fleshy part of the right\narm.",
    "He flings the pistol through the window tears off the glove with his\nteeth and throws it into the fire.",
    "When I arrive he is lying on the floor in a\nfaint.\u201d\nBundle drew a deep breath.",
    "\u201cYou didn\u2019t realize all this at the time Superintendent Battle\u201d\n\u201cNo that I didn\u2019t.",
    "I was taken in as much as anyone could be.",
    "It wasn\u2019t till\nlong afterwards that I pieced it all together.",
    "Finding the glove was the\nbeginning of it.",
    "Then I made Sir Oswald throw the pistol through the window.",
    "It fell a good way farther on than it should have done.",
    "But a man who is righthanded doesn\u2019t throw nearly as far with the left hand.",
    "Even then it was only\nsuspicion\u2014and a very faint suspicion at that.",
    "\u201cBut there was one point struck me.",
    "The papers were obviously thrown\ndown for someone to pick up.",
    "If Miss Wade was there by accident who was\nthe real person Of course for those who weren\u2019t in the know that question\nwas answered easily enough\u2014the Countess.",
    "But there I had the pull over you.",
    "I knew the Countess was all right.",
    "So what follows Why the idea that the\npapers had actually been picked up by the person they were meant for.",
    "And\nthe more I thought of it the more it seemed to me a very remarkable\ncoincidence that Miss Wade should have arrived at the exact moment she\ndid.\u201d\n\u201cIt must have been very difficult for you when I came to you full of\nsuspicion about the Countess.\u201d\n\u201cIt was Lady Eileen.",
    "I had to say something to put you off the scent.",
    "And\nit was very difficult for Mr. Eversleigh here with the lady coming out of a\ndead faint and no knowing what she might say.\u201d\n\u201cI understand Bill\u2019s anxiety now\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cAnd the way he kept\nurging her to take time and not talk till she felt quite all right.\u201d\n\u201cPoor old Bill\u201d said Miss St. Maur.",
    "\u201cThat poor baby had to be vamped\nagainst his will\u2014getting madder\u2019n a hornet every minute.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell\u201d said Superintendent Battle \u201cthere it was.",
    "I suspected Mr. Thesiger\n\u2014but I couldn\u2019t get definite proof.",
    "On the other hand Mr. Thesiger himself\nwas rattled.",
    "He realized more or less what he was up against in the Seven\nDials\u2014but he wanted badly to know who No 7 was.",
    "He got himself asked to\nthe Cootes under the impression that Sir Oswald Coote was No 7.\u201d\n\u201cI suspected Sir Oswald\u201d said Bundle \u201cespecially when he came in from\nthe garden that night.\u201d\n\u201cI never suspected him\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t mind telling you that I\ndid have my suspicions of that young chap his secretary.\u201d\n\u201cPongo\u201d said Bill.",
    "\u201cNot old Pongo\u201d\n\u201cYes Mr. Eversleigh old Pongo as you call him.",
    "A very efficient\ngentleman and one that could have put anything through if he\u2019d a mind to.",
    "I\nsuspected him partly because he\u2019d been the one to take the clocks into Mr.\nWade\u2019s room that night.",
    "It would have been easy for him to put the bottle and\nglass by the bedside then.",
    "And then for another thing he was lefthanded.",
    "That glove pointed straight to him\u2014if it hadn\u2019t been for one thing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cThe teeth marks\u2014only a man whose right hand was incapacitated would\nhave needed to tear off that glove with his teeth.\u201d\n\u201cSo Pongo was cleared.\u201d\n\u201cSo Pongo was cleared as you say.",
    "I\u2019m sure it would be a great surprise to\nMr. Bateman to know he was ever suspected.\u201d\n\u201cIt would\u201d agreed Bill.",
    "\u201cA solemn card\u2014a silly ass like Pongo.",
    "How\ncould you ever think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell as far as that goes Mr. Thesiger was what you might describe as an\nemptyheaded young ass of the most brainless description.",
    "One of the two\nwas playing a part.",
    "When I decided that it was Mr. Thesiger I was interested\nto get Mr. Bateman\u2019s opinion of him.",
    "All along Mr. Bateman had the gravest\nsuspicions of Mr. Thesiger and frequently said as much to Sir Oswald.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s curious\u201d said Bill \u201cbut Pongo always is right.",
    "It\u2019s maddening.\u201d\n\u201cWell as I say\u201d went on Superintendent Battle \u201cwe got Mr. Thesiger\nfairly on the run badly rattled over this Seven Dials business and uncertain\n\n\fjust where the danger lay.",
    "That we got him in the end was solely through Mr.\nEversleigh.",
    "He knew what he was up against and he risked his life cheerfully.",
    "But he never dreamt that you would be dragged into it Lady Eileen.\u201d\n\u201cMy God no\u201d said Bill with feeling.",
    "\u201cHe went round to Mr. Thesiger\u2019s rooms with a cookedup tale\u201d\ncontinued Battle.",
    "\u201cHe was to pretend that certain papers of Mr. Devereux\u2019s\nhad come into his hands.",
    "Those papers were to suggest a suspicion of Mr.\nThesiger.",
    "Naturally as the honest friend Mr. Eversleigh rushed round sure\nthat Mr. Thesiger would have an explanation.",
    "We calculated that if we were\nright Mr. Thesiger would try and put Mr. Eversleigh out of the way and we\nwere fairly certain as to the way he\u2019d do it.",
    "Sure enough Mr. Thesiger gave\nhis guest a whisky and soda.",
    "During the minute or two that his host was out of\nthe room.",
    "Mr. Eversleigh poured that into a jar on the mantelpiece but he had\nto pretend of course that the drug was taking effect.",
    "It would be slow he\nknew not sudden.",
    "He began his story and Mr. Thesiger at first denied it all\nindignantly but as soon as he saw or thought he saw that the drug was\ntaking effect he admitted everything and told Mr. Eversleigh that he was the\nthird victim.",
    "\u201cWhen Mr. Eversleigh was nearly unconscious Mr. Thesiger took him\ndown to the car and helped him in.",
    "The hood was up.",
    "He must already have\ntelephoned to you unknown to Mr. Eversleigh.",
    "He made a clever suggestion\nto you.",
    "You were to say that you were taking Miss Wade home.",
    "\u201cYou made no mention of a message from him.",
    "Later when your body was\nfound here Miss Wade would swear that you had driven her home and gone\nup to London with the idea of penetrating into this house by yourself.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Eversleigh continued to play his part that of the unconscious man.",
    "I\nmay say that as soon as the two young men had left Jermyn Street one of my\nmen gained admission and found the doctored whisky which contained\nenough hydrochloride of morphia to kill two men.",
    "Also the car they were in\nwas followed.",
    "Mr. Thesiger drove out of town to a wellknown golf course\nwhere he showed himself for a few minutes speaking of playing a round.",
    "That of course was for an alibi should one be needed.",
    "He left the car with\nMr. Eversleigh in it a little way down the road.",
    "Then he drove back to town\nand to the Seven Dials Club.",
    "As soon as he saw Alfred leave he drove up to\nthe door spoke to Mr. Eversleigh as he got out in case you might be listening\n\n\fand came into the house and played his little comedy.",
    "\u201cWhen he pretended to go for a doctor he really only slammed the door\nand then crept quietly upstairs and hid behind the door of this room where\nMiss Wade would presently send you up on some excuse.",
    "Mr. Eversleigh of\ncourse was horrorstruck when he saw you but he thought it best to keep up\nthe part he was playing.",
    "He knew our people were watching the house and he\nimagined that there was no immediate danger intended to you.",
    "He could\nalways \u2018come to life\u2019 at any moment.",
    "When Mr. Thesiger threw his revolver\non the table and apparently left the house it seemed safer than ever.",
    "As for the\nnext bit\u2014\u201d He paused looking at Bill.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to tell that sir.\u201d\n\u201cI was still lying on that bally sofa\u201d said Bill \u201ctrying to look done in and\ngetting the fidgets worse and worse.",
    "Then I heard someone run down the\nstairs and Loraine got up and went to the door.",
    "I heard Thesiger\u2019s voice but\nnot what he said.",
    "I heard Loraine say \u2018That\u2019s all right\u2014it\u2019s gone splendidly.\u2019\nThen he said \u2018Help me carry him up.",
    "It will be a bit of a job but I want them\nboth together there\u2014a nice little surprise for No 7.\u2019 I didn\u2019t quite understand\nwhat they were jawing about but they hauled me up the stairs somehow or\nother.",
    "It was a bit of a job for them.",
    "I made myself a dead weight all right.",
    "They heaved me in here and then I heard Loraine say \u2018You\u2019re sure it\u2019s all\nright She won\u2019t come round\u2019 And Jimmy said\u2014the damned blackguard\n\u2018No fear.",
    "I hit her with all my might.\u2019\n\u201cThey went away and locked the door and then I opened my eyes and\nsaw you.",
    "My God Bundle I shall never feel so perfectly awful again.",
    "I\nthought you were dead.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose my hat saved me\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cPartly\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cBut partly it was Mr. Thesiger\u2019s\nwounded arm.",
    "He didn\u2019t realize it himself\u2014but it had only half its usual\nstrength.",
    "Still that\u2019s all no credit to the Department.",
    "We didn\u2019t take the care of\nyou we ought to have done Lady Eileen\u2014and it\u2019s a black blot on the whole\nbusiness.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very tough\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cAnd also rather lucky.",
    "What I can\u2019t get\nover is Loraine being in it.",
    "She was such a gentle little thing.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cSo was the Pentonville murderess that\nkilled five children.",
    "You can\u2019t go by that.",
    "She\u2019s got bad blood in her\u2014her\n\n\ffather ought to have seen the inside of a prison more than once.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got her too\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle nodded.",
    "\u201cI daresay they won\u2019t hang her\u2014juries are softhearted.",
    "But young\nThesiger will swing all right\u2014and a good thing too\u2014a more utterly depraved\nand callous criminal I never met.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now\u201d he added \u201cif your head isn\u2019t aching too badly Lady Eileen\nwhat about a little celebration There\u2019s a nice little restaurant round the\ncorner.\u201d\nBundle heartily agreed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m starving Superintendent Battle.",
    "Besides\u201d she looked round.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve\ngot to get to know all my colleagues.\u201d\n\u201cThe Seven Dials\u201d said Bill.",
    "\u201cHurrah Some fizz is what we need.",
    "Do\nthey run to fizz at this place Battle\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have anything to complain of sir.",

    "As it is I shall have to put up with Bill.\u201d\nOceanofPDF.com\n\n\fThirtyfour\nLORD CATERHAM APPROVES\n\n\u201cFather\u201d said Bundle \u201cI\u2019ve got to break a piece of news to you.",
    "You\u2019re\ngoing to lose me.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re suffering\nfrom galloping consumption or a weak heart or anything like that because I\nsimply don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not death\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s marriage.\u201d\n\u201cVery nearly as bad\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cI suppose I shall have to come\nto the wedding all dressed up in tight uncomfortable clothes and give you\naway.",
    "And Lomax may think it necessary to kiss me in the vestry.\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens You don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to marry George do you\u201d\ncried Bundle.",
    "\u201cWell something like that seemed to be in the wind last time I saw you\u201d\nsaid her father.",
    "\u201cYesterday morning you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be married to someone a hundred times nicer than George\u201d\nsaid Bundle.",

    "\u201cBut one never knows.",
    "I don\u2019t\nfeel you\u2019re really a good judge of character Bundle.",
    "You told me that young\nThesiger was a cheerful inefficient and from all I hear now it seems that he\nwas one of the most efficient criminals of the day.",
    "The sad thing is that I\nnever met him.",
    "I was thinking of writing my reminiscences soon\u2014with a\nspecial chapter on murderers I have met\u2014and by a purely technical oversight\nI never met this young man.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly\u201d said Bundle.",
    "\u201cYou know you haven\u2019t got the energy to\nwrite reminiscences or anything else.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t actually going to write them myself\u201d said Lord Caterham.",
    "\u201cI\nbelieve that\u2019s never done.",

    "She collects the material and does all the actual\nwriting.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you do\u201d\n\u201cOh just give her a few facts for half an hour every day.",
    "Nothing more\nthan that.\u201d After a slight pause Lord Catherham said \u201cShe was a nicelooking girl\u2014very restful and sympathetic.\u201d\n\u201cFather\u201d said Bundle \u201cI have a feeling that without me you will run into\ndeadly danger.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent kinds of danger suit different kinds of people\u201d said Lord\nCaterham.",
    "He was moving away when he turned back and said over his shoulder\n\u201cBy the way Bundle who are you marrying\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering\u201d said Bundle \u201cwhen you were going to ask me that.",
    "I\u2019m going to marry Bill Eversleigh.\u201d\nThe egoist thought it over for a minute.",
