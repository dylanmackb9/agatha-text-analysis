    "The scene that met his eyes was typical of the English\ncountryside as depicted on Xmas cards and in oldfashioned\nmelodramas.",
    "Everywhere was snow deep drifts of it  no mere\npowdering an inch or two thick.",
    "Snow had fallen all over England\nfor the last four days and up here on the fringe of Dartmoor it had\nattained a depth of several feet.",
    "All over England householders\nwere groaning over burst pipes and to have a plumber friend or\neven a plumbers mate was the most coveted of all distinctions.",
    "Up here in the tiny village of Sittaford at all times remote from the\nworld and now almost completely cut off the rigors of winter were\na very real problem.",
    "Major Burnaby however was a hardy soul.",
    "He snorted twice\ngrunted once and marched resolutely out into the snow.",
    "His destination was not far away.",
    "A few paces along a winding lane\nthen in at a gate and so up a drive partially swept clear of snow to a\nhouse of some considerable size built of granite.",
    "The door was opened by a neatly clad parlormaid.",
    "The Major was\ndivested of his British Warm his gum boots and his aged scarf.",
    "A door was flung open and he passed through it into a room which\nconveyed all the illusion of a transformation scene.",
    "Although it was only half past three the curtains had been drawn\nthe electric lights were on and a huge fire blazed cheerfully on the\nhearth.",
    "Two women in afternoon frocks rose to greet the staunch\nold warrior.",
    "Splendid of you to turn out Major Burnaby said the elder of the\ntwo.",
    "Not at all Mrs Willett not at all.",
    "Very good of you to ask me.",
    "He\nshook hands with them both.",
    "Mr Garfield is coming went on Mrs Willett and Mr Duke and Mr\nRycroft said he would come  but one can hardly expect him at his\nage in such weather.",
    "Really it is too dreadful.",
    "One feels one must\ndo something to keep oneself cheerful.",
    "Violet put another log on\nthe fire.",
    "The Major rose gallantly to perform this task.",
    "Allow me Miss Violet.",
    "He put the log expertly in the right place and returned once more to\nthe armchair his hostess had indicated.",
    "Trying not to appear as\nthough he were doing so he cast surreptitious glances round the\nroom.",
    "Amazing how a couple of women could alter the whole\ncharacter of a room  and without doing anything very outstanding\nthat you could put your finger on.",
    "Sittaford House had been built ten years ago by Captain Joseph\nTrevelyan B.N.",
    "on the occasion of his retirement from the Navy.",
    "He was a man of substance and he had always had a great\nhankering to live on Dartmoor.",
    "He had placed his chance on the tiny\nhamlet of Sittaford.",
    "It was not in a valley like most of the villages\nand farms but perched right on the shoulder of the moor under the\nshadow of Sittaford Beacon.",
    "He had purchased a large tract of\nground had built a comfortable house with its own electric light\nplant and an electric pump to save labor in pumping water.",
    "Then as\na speculation he had built six small bungalows each in its quarter\nacre of ground along the lane.",
    "The first of these the one at his very gates had been allotted to his\nold friend and crony John Burnaby  the others had by degrees\nbeen sold there being several people who from choice or necessity\nliked to live right out of the world.",
    "The village itself consisted of\nthree picturesque but dilapidated cottages a forge and a\ncombined post office and sweet shop.",
    "The nearest town was\nExhampton six miles away a steady descent which necessitated\nthe sign Motorists engage your lowest gear so familiar on the\nDartmoor roads.",
    "Captain Trevelyan as has been said was a man of substance.",
    "In\nspite of this  or perhaps because of it  he was a man who was\ninordinately fond of money.",
    "At the end of October a houseagent in\nExhampton wrote to him asking if he would consider letting\nSittaford House.",
    "A tenant had made inquiries concerning it wishing to rent it for the\nwinter.",
    "Captain Trevelyans first impulse was to refuse his second to\ndemand further information.",
    "The tenant in question proved to be a\nMrs Willett a widow with one daughter.",
    "She had recently arrived\nfrom South Africa and wanted a house on Dartmoor for the winter.",
    "Damn it all the woman must be mad said Captain Trevelyan.",
    "Eh\nBurnaby dont you think so\n\nBurnaby did think so and said so as forcibly as his friend had done.",
    "Anyway you dont want to let he said.",
    "Let the fool woman go\nsomewhere else if she wants to freeze.",
    "Coming from South Africa\ntoo\n\nBut at this point Captain Trevelyans money complex asserted itself.",
    "Not once in a hundred times would you get a chance of letting your\nhouse in midwinter.",
    "He demanded what rent the tenant was willing\nto pay.",
    "An offer of twelve guineas a week clinched matters.",
    "Captain\nTrevelyan went into Exhampton rented a small house on the\n\n\foutskirts at two guineas a week and handed over Sittaford House\nto Mrs Willet half the rent to be paid in advance.",
    "A fool and her money are soon parted he growled.",
    "But Burnaby\nwas thinking this afternoon as he scanned Mrs Willett covertly that\nshe did not look a fool.",
    "She was a tall woman with a rather silly\nmanner  but her physiognomy was shrewd rather than foolish.",
    "She\nwas inclined to overdress had a distinct Colonial accent and\nseemed perfectly content with the transaction.",
    "She was clearly\nvery well off and that as Burnaby had reflected more than once\nreally made the whole affair more odd.",
    "She was not the kind of\nwoman one would credit with a passion for solitude.",
    "As a neighbor she had proved almost embarrassingly friendly.",
    "Invitations to Sittaford House were rained on everybody.",
    "Captain\nTrevelyan was constantly urged to Treat the house as though we\nhadnt rented it.",
    "Trevelyan however was not fond of women.",
    "Report went that he had been jilted in his youth.",
    "He persistently\nrefused all invitations.",
    "Two months had passed since the installation of the Willetts and the\nfirst wonder at their arrival had passed away.",
    "Burnaby naturally a silent man continued to study his hostess\noblivious to any need for small talk.",
    "Liked to make herself out a fool\nbut wasnt really.",
    "So he summed up the situation.",
    "His glance shifted\nto Violet Willett.",

    "Supposing\nsomething had happened to Captain Trevelyan... Supposing...\n\nChapter 3\n\nFIVE AND TWENTY PAST FIVE\n\nTwo and half hours later just before eight oclock Major Burnaby\nhurricane lantern in hand his head dropped forward so as not to\nmeet the blinding drive of the snow stumbled up the path to the\ndoor of Hazelmoor the small house tenanted by Captain\nTrevelyan.",
    "The snow had begun to fall about an hour ago  great blinding flakes\nof it.",
    "Major Burnaby was gasping emitting the loud sighing gasps of\nan utterly exhausted man.",
    "He was numbed with cold.",
    "He stamped\nhis feet blew puffed snorted and applied a numbed finger to the\nbell push.",
    "The bell trilled shrilly.",
    "Burnaby waited.",
    "After a pause of a few minutes as nothing\nhappened he pushed the bell again.",
    "Once more there was no stir of life.",
    "Burnaby rang a third time.",
    "This time he kept his finger on the bell.",
    "It trilled on and on  but there was still no sign of life in the house.",
    "There was a knocker on the door.",
    "Major Burnaby seized it and\nworked it vigorously producing a noise like thunder.",
    "And still the little house remained silent as the dead.",
    "The Major\ndesisted.",
    "He stood for a moment as though perplexed  then he\nslowly went down the path and out at the gate continuing on the\nroad he had come towards Exhampton.",
    "A hundred yards brought\nhim to the small police station.",
    "He hesitated again then finally made up his mind and entered.",
    "Constable Graves who knew the Major well rose in astonishment.",
    "Well I never sir fancy you being out on a night like this.",
    "Look here said Burnaby curtly.",
    "Ive been ringing and knocking\nat the Captains house and I cant get any answer.",
    "Why of course its Friday said Graves who knew the habits of\nthe two pretty well.",
    "But you dont mean to say youve actually come\ndown from Sittaford on a night like this Surely the Captain would\nnever expect you.",
    "Whether hes expected me or not Ive come said Burnaby testily.",
    "And as Im telling you I cant get in.",
    "Ive rung and knocked and\nnobody answers.",
    "Some of his uneasiness seemed to communicate itself to the\npoliceman.",
    "Thats odd he said frowning.",
    "Of course its odd said Burnaby.",
    "Its not as though hes likely to be out  on a night like this.",
    "Of course hes not likely to be out.",
    "It is odd said Graves again.",
    "Burnaby displayed impatience at the mans slowness.",
    "Arent you going to do something he snapped.",
    "Do something\n\nYes do something.",
    "The policeman ruminated.",
    "Think he might have been taken bad His face brightened.",
    "Ill try\nthe telephone.",
    "It stood at his elbow.",
    "He took it up and gave the\nnumber.",
    "But to the telephone as to the front door bell Captain Trevelyan\ngave no reply.",
    "Looks as though he had been taken bad said Graves as he\nreplaced the receiver.",
    "And all alone in the house too.",
    "Wed best\nget hold of Dr Warren and take him along with us.",
    "Dr Warrens house was almost next door to the police station.",
    "The\ndoctor was just sitting down to dinner with his wife and was not\nbest pleased at the summons.",
    "However he grudgingly agreed to\naccompany them drawing on an aged British Warm and a pair of\nrubber boots and muffling his neck with a knitted scarf.",
    "The snow was still falling.",
    "Damnable night murmured the doctor.",
    "Hope you havent\nbrought me out on a wild goose chase.",
    "Trevelyans as strong as a\nhorse.",
    "Never has anything the matter with him.",
    "Burnaby did not reply.",
    "Arriving at Hazelmoor once more they again rang and knocked\nbut elicited no response.",
    "The doctor then suggested going round the house to one of the\nback windows.",
    "Easier to force than the door.",
    "Graves agreeing they went round to the back.",
    "There was a side\ndoor which they tried on the way but it too was locked and\npresently they emerged on the snowcovered lawn that led up to\nthe back windows.",
    "Suddenly Warren uttered an exclamation.",
    "The window of the study  its open.",
    "True enough the window a French one was standing ajar.",
    "They\nquickened their steps.",
    "On a night like this no one in his senses\nwould open a window.",
    "There was a light in the room that streamed\nout in a thin yellow band.",
    "The three men arrived simultaneously at the window  Burnaby was\nthe first man to enter the constable hard on his heels.",
    "They both stopped dead inside and something like a muffled cry\ncame from the exsoldier.",
    "In another moment Warren was beside\nthem and saw what they had seen.",
    "Captain Trevelyan lay on the floor face downwards.",
    "His arms\nsprawled widely.",
    "The room was in confusion  drawers of the\nbureau pulled out papers lying about the floor.",
    "The window beside\nthem was splintered where it had been forced near the lock.",
    "Beside\nCaptain Trevelyan was a dark green baize tube about two inches in\ndiameter.",
    "Warren sprang forward.",
    "He knelt down by the prostrate figure.",
    "One minute sufficed.",
    "He rose to his feet his face pale.",
    "Hes dead asked Burnaby.",
    "The doctor nodded.",
    "Then he turned to Graves.",
    "Its you to say whats to be done.",
    "I can do nothing except examine\nthe body and perhaps youd rather I didnt do that until the\nInspector comes.",
    "I can tell you the cause of death now.",
    "Fracture of\nthe base of the skull.",
    "And I think I can make a guess at the weapon.",
    "He indicated the green baize tube.",
    "Trevelyan always had them along the bottom of the door  to keep\nthe draft out said Burnaby.",
    "His voice was hoarse.",
    "Yes  a very efficient form of sandbag.",
    "My God\n\nBut this here  the constable broke in his wits arriving at the point\nslowly.",
    "You mean  this here is murder.",
    "The policeman stepped to the table on which stood a telephone.",
    "Major Burnaby approached the doctor.",
    "Have you any idea he said breathing hard how long hes been\ndead\n\nAbout two hours I should say or possibly three.",
    "Thats a rough\nestimate.",
    "Burnaby passed his tongue over dry lips.",
    "Would you say he asked that he might have been killed at five\ntwentyfive\n\nThe doctor looked at him curiously.",
    "If I had to give a time definitely thats just about the time I would\nsuggest.",
    "Oh my God said Burnaby.",
    "Warren stared at him.",
    "The Major felt his way blindly to a chair collapsed on to it and\nmuttered to himself whilst a kind of staring terror overspread his\nface.",
    "Five and twenty past five  Oh my God then it was true after all.",
    "Chapter 4\n\nINSPECTOR NARRACOTT\n\nIt was the morning after the tragedy and two men were standing in\nthe little study of Hazelmoor.",
    "Inspector Narracott looked round him.",
    "A little frown appeared upon\nhis forehead.",
    "Yees he said thoughtfully.",
    "Yees.",
    "Inspector Narracott was a very efficient officer.",
    "He had a quiet\npersistence a logical mind and a keen attention to detail which\nbrought him success where many another man might have failed.",
    "He was a tall man with a quiet manner rather far away gray eyes\nand a slow soft Devonshire voice.",
    "Summoned from Exeter to take charge of the case he had arrived\non the first train that morning.",
    "The roads had been impassable for\ncars even with chains otherwise he would have arrived the night\n\n\fbefore.",
    "He was standing now in Captain Trevelyans study having\njust completed his examination of the room.",
    "With him was Sergeant\nPollock of the Exhampton police.",
    "Yees said Inspector Narracott.",
    "A ray of pale wintry sunshine came in through the window.",
    "Outside\nwas the snowy landscape.",
    "There was a fence about a hundred\nyards from the window and beyond it the steep ascending slope of\nthe snowcovered hillside.",
    "Inspector Narracott bent once more over the body which had been\nleft for his inspection.",
    "An athletic man himself he recognized the\nathletes type the broad shoulders narrow flanks and the good\nmuscular development.",
    "The head was small and well set on the\nshoulders and the pointed naval beard was carefully trimmed.",
    "Captain Trevelyans age he had ascertained was sixty but he\nlooked not much more than fiftyone or two.",
    "Its a curious business said Inspector Narracott.",
    "Ah said Sergeant Pollock.",
    "The other turned on him.",
    "What is your view of it\n\nWell  Sergeant Pollock scratched his head.",
    "He was a cautious\nman unwilling to advance further than necessary.",
    "Well he said as I see it sir I should say that the man came to\nthe window forced the lock and started rifling the room.",
    "Captain\nTrevelyan I suppose must have been upstairs.",
    "Doubtless the\nburglar thought the house was empty \n\nWhere is Captain Trevelyans bedroom situated\n\nUpstairs sir.",
    "Over this room.",
    "At the present time of year it is dark at four oclock.",
    "If Captain\nTrevelyan was up in his bedroom the electric light would have been\non the burglar would have seen it as he approached this window.",
    "You mean hed have waited.",
    "No man in his senses would break into a house with a light in it.",
    "If\nanyone forced this window  he did it because he thought the house\nwas empty.",
    "Sergeant Pollock scratched his head.",
    "Seems a bit odd I admit.",
    "But there it is.",
    "Well let it pass for the moment.",
    "Go on.",
    "Well suppose the Captain hears a noise downstairs.",
    "He comes\ndown to investigate.",
    "The burglar hears him coming.",
    "He snatches up\nthat bolster arrangement gets behind the door and as the Captain\nenters the room strikes him down from behind.",
    "Inspector Narracott nodded.",
    "Yes thats true enough.",
    "He was struck down when he was facing\nthe window.",
    "But all the same Pollock I dont like it.",
    "No sir\n\nNo as I say I dont believe in houses that are broken into at five\noclock in the afternoon.",
    "Weell he may have thought it a good opportunity \n\nIt is not a question of opportunity  slipping in because he found a\nwindow unlatched.",
    "It was deliberate housebreaking  look at the\nconfusion everywhere  what would a burglar go for first The\npantry where the silver is kept.",
    "Thats true enough admitted the Sergeant.",
    "And this confusion  this chaos continued Narracott these\ndrawers pulled out and their contents scattered.",
    "Pah Its bunkum.",
    "Bunkum\n\nLook at the window Sergeant.",
    "That window was not locked and\nforced open It was merely shut and then splintered from the\noutside to give the appearance of forcing.",
    "Pollock examined the latch of the window closely uttering an\nejaculation to himself as he did so.",
    "You are right sir he said with respect in his voice.",
    "Whod have\nthought of that now\n\nSomeone who wishes to throw dust in our eyes  and hasnt\nsucceeded.",
    "Sergeant Pollock was grateful for the our.",
    "In such small ways did\nInspector Narracott endear himself to his subordinates.",
    "Then it wasnt burglary.",
    "You mean sir it was an inside job.",
    "Inspector Narracott nodded.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "The only curious thing\nis though that I think the murderer did actually enter by the\nwindow.",
    "As you and Graves reported and as I can still see for\nmyself there are damp patches still visible where the snow melted\nand was trodden in by the murderers boots.",
    "These damp patches\nare only in this room.",
    "Constable Graves was quite positive that\nthere was nothing of the kind in the hall when he and Dr Warren\npassed through it.",
    "In this room he noticed them immediately.",
    "In that\ncase it seems clear that the murderer was admitted by Captain\nTrevelyan through the window.",
    "Therefore it must have been\nsomeone whom Captain Trevelyan knew.",
    "You are a local man\nSergeant can you tell me if Captain Trevelyan was a man who\nmade enemies easily\n\nNo sir I should say he hadnt an enemy in the world.",
    "A bit keen on\nmoney and a bit of a martinet  wouldnt stand for any slackness or\nincivility  but bless my soul he was respected for that.",
    "No enemies said Narracott thoughtfully.",
    "Not here that is.",
    "Very true  we dont know that enemies he may have made during\nhis naval career.",
    "Its my experience Sergeant that a man who\nmakes enemies in one place will make them in another but I agree\nthat we cant put that possibility entirely aside.",
    "We come logically\nnow to the next motive  the most common motive for every crime gain.",
    "Captain Trevelyan was I understand a rich man\n\nVery warm indeed by all accounts.",
    "But close.",
    "Not an easy man to\ntouch for a subscription.",
    "Ah said Narracott thoughtfully.",
    "Pity it snowed as it did said the Sergeant.",
    "But for that wed have\nhad his footprints as something to go on.",
    "There was no one else in the house asked the Inspector.",
    "No.",
    "For the last five years Captain Trevelyan has only had one\nservant  retired naval chap.",
    "Up at Sittaford House a woman came\nin daily but this chap Evans cooked and looked after his master.",
    "About a month ago he got married  much to the Captains\nannoyance.",
    "I believe thats one of the reasons he let Sittaford\nHouse to this South African lady.",
    "He wouldnt have any woman\nliving in the house.",
    "Evans lives just round the corner here in Fore\nStreet with his wife and comes in daily to do for his master.",
    "Ive got\nhim here now for you to see.",
    "His statement is that he left here at\n\n\fhalf past two yesterday afternoon the Captain having no further\nneed for him.",
    "Yes I shall want to see him.",
    "He may be able to tell us something useful.",
    "Sergeant Pollock looked at his superior officer curiously.",
    "There\nwas something so odd about his tone.",
    "You think  he began.",
    "I think said Inspector Narracott deliberately that theres a lot\nmore in this case than meets the eye.",
    "In what way sir\n\nBut the Inspector refused to be drawn.",
    "You say this man Evans is here now\n\nHes waiting in the diningroom.",
    "Good Ill see him straight away.",
    "What sort of a fellow is he\n\nSergeant Pollock was better at reporting facts than at descriptive\naccuracy.",
    "Hes a retired naval chap.",
    "Ugly customer in a scrap I should say.",
    "Does he drink\n\n\fNever been the worse for it that I know of.",
    "What about this wife of his Not a fancy of the Captains or\nanything of that sort\n\nOh no sir nothing of that kind about Captain Trevelyan.",
    "He\nwasnt that kind at all.",
    "He was known as a woman hater if\nanything.",
    "And Evans was supposed to be devoted to his master\n\nThats the general idea sir and I think it would be known if he\nwasnt.",
    "Exhamptons a small place.",
    "Inspector Narracott nodded.",
    "Well he said theres nothing more to be seen here.",
    "Ill interview\nEvans and Ill take a look at the rest of the house and after that we\nwill go over to the Three Crowns and see this Major Burnaby.",
    "That\nremark of his about the time was curious.",
    "Twentyfive minutes past\nfive eh He must know something he hasnt told or why should he\nsuggest the time of the crime so accurately.",
    "The two men moved toward the door.",
    "Its a rum business said Sergeant Pollock his eye wandering to\nthe littered floor.",
    "All this burglary fake\n\n\fIts not that that strikes me as odd said Narracott under the\ncircumstances it was probably the natural thing to do.",
    "No  what\nstrikes me as odd is the window.",
    "The window sir\n\nYes.",
    "Why should the murderer go to the window Assuming it was\nsomeone Trevelyan knew and admitted without question why not\ngo to the front door To get round to this window from the road on a\nnight like last night would have been a difficult and unpleasant\nproceeding with the snow lying as thick as it does.",
    "Yet there must\nhave been some reason.",
    "Perhaps suggested Pollock the man didnt want to be seen\nturning into the house from the road.",
    "There wouldnt be many people about yesterday afternoon to see\nhim.",
    "Nobody who could help it was out of doors.",
    "No  theres some\nother reason.",
    "Well perhaps it will come to light in due course.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nEVANS\n\nThey found Evans waiting in the diningroom.",
    "He rose respectfully\non their entrance.",
    "He was a short thickset man.",
    "He had very long arms and a habit of\nstanding with his hands half clenched.",
    "He was clean shaven with\nsmall rather piglike eyes yet he had a look of cheerfulness and\nefficiency that redeemed his bulldog appearance.",
    "Inspector\n\nNarracott\n\nmentally\n\ntabulated\n\nhis\n\nimpressions.",
    "Intelligent.",
    "Shrewd and practical.",
    "Looks rattled.",
    "Then he spoke\n\nYoure Evans eh\n\nYes sir.",
    "Christian names\n\nRobert Henry.",
    "Ah Now what do you know about this business\n\nNot a thing sir.",
    "Its fair knocked me over.",
    "To think of the Capting\nbeing done in\n\nWhen did you last see your master\n\nTwo oclock I should say it was sir.",
    "I cleared away the lunch things\nand laid the table here as you see for supper.",
    "The Capting he told\nme as I neednt come back.",
    "What do you usually do\n\n\fAs a general rule I come back about seven for a couple of hours.",
    "Not always  sometimes the Capting would say as I neednt.",
    "Then you werent surprised when he told you that yesterday you\nwouldnt be wanted again\n\nNo sir.",
    "I didnt come back the evening before either  on account\nof the weather.",
    "Very considerate gentleman the Capting was as\nlong as you didnt try to shirk things.",
    "I knew him and his ways pretty\nwell.",
    "What exactly did he say\n\nWell he looked out of the window and he says Not a hope of\nBurnaby today.",
    "Shouldnt wonder he says if Sittaford isnt cut off\naltogether.",
    "Dont remember such a winter since I was a boy.",
    "That\nwas his friend Major Burnaby over to Sittaford that he was referring\nto.",
    "Always comes on a Friday he does he and the Capting play\nchess and do acrostics.",
    "And on Tuesdays the Capting would go to\nMajor Burnabys.",
    "Very regular in his habits was the Capting.",
    "Then\nhe said to me You can go now Evans and you neednt come till\ntomorrow morning.",
    "Apart from his reference to Major Burnaby he didnt speak of\nexpecting anyone that afternoon\n\nNo sir not a word.",
    "There was nothing unusual or different in any way in his manner.",
    "No sir not that I could see.",
    "Ah Now I understand Evans that you have lately got married.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Mrs Bellings daughter at the Three Crowns.",
    "Matter of two\nmonths ago sir.",
    "And Captain Trevelyan was not overpleased about it.",
    "A very faint grin appeared for a moment on Evans face.",
    "Cut up rough about it he did the Capting.",
    "My Rebecca is a fine\ngirl sir and a very good cook.",
    "And I hoped we might have been\nable to do for the Capting together but he  he wouldnt hear of it.",
    "Said he wouldnt have women servants about his house.",
    "In fact sir\nthings were rather at a deadlock when this South African lady came\nalong and wanted to take Sittaford House for the winter.",
    "The\nCapting he rented this place I came in to do for him every day and\nI dont mind telling you sir that I had been hoping that by the end of\nthe winter the Capting would have come round to the idea and that\nme and Rebecca would go back to Sittaford with him.",
    "Why he\nwould never even know she was in the house.",
    "She would keep to\nthe kitchen and she would manage so that he would never meet\nher on the stairs.",
    "Have you any idea what lay behind Captain Trevelyans dislike of\nwomen\n\n\fNothing to it sir.",
    "Just an abit sir thats all.",
    "I have seen many a\ngentleman like it before.",
    "If you ask me its nothing more or less\nthan shyness.",
    "Some young lady or other gives them a snub when\nthey are young  and they gets the abit.",
    "Captain Trevelyan was not married\n\nNo indeed sir.",
    "What relations had he Do you know\n\nI believe he had a sister living at Exeter sir and I think I have\nheard him mention a nephew or nephews.",
    "None of them ever came to see him\n\nNo sir.",
    "I think he quarreled with his sister at Exeter.",
    "Do you know her name\n\nGardner I think sir but I wouldnt be sure.",
    "You dont know her address\n\nIm afraid I dont sir.",
    "Well doubtless we shall come across that in looking through\nCaptain Trevelyans papers.",
    "Now Evans what were you yourself\ndoing from four oclock onwards yesterday afternoon\n\n\fI was at home sir.",
    "Where s home\n\nJust round the corner sir 85 Fore Street.",
    "You didnt go out at all\n\nNot likely sir.",
    "Why the snow was coming down a fair treat.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "Is there anyone who can support your statement\n\nBeg pardon sir.",
    "Is there anyone who knows that you were at home during that\ntime\n\nMy wife sir.",
    "She and you were alone in the house\n\nYes sir.",
    "Well well I have no doubt thats all right.",
    "That will be all for the\npresent Evans.",
    "The exsailor hesitated.",
    "He shifted from one foot to the other.",
    "Anything I can do here sir  in the way of tidying up\n\n\fNo  the whole place is to be left exactly as it is for the present.",
    "I see.",
    "You had better wait though until I have had a look round said\nNarracott in case there might be any question I want to ask you.",
    "Very good sir.",
    "Inspector Narracott transferred his gaze from Evans to the room.",
    "The interview had taken place in the diningroom.",
    "On the table an\nevening meal was set out.",
    "A cold tongue pickles a Stilton cheese\nand biscuits and on a gas ring by the fire a saucepan containing\nsoup.",
    "On the sideboard was a tantalus a soda water siphon and\ntwo bottles of beer.",
    "There was also an immense array of silver cups\nand with them  a rather incongruous item three very new looking\nnovels.",
    "Inspector Narracott examined one or two of the cups and read the\ninscriptions on them.",
    "Bit a sportsman Captain Trevelyan he observed.",
    "Yes indeed sir said Evans.",
    "Been an athlete all his life he had.",
    "Inspector Narracott read the titles of the novels.",
    "Love Turns the\nKey The Merry Men of Lincoln Loves Prisoner.",
    "Hm he remarked.",
    "The Captains taste in literature seems\nsomewhat incongruous.",
    "Oh that sir.",
    "Evans laughed.",
    "Thats not for reading sir.",
    "Thats\nthe prizes he won in these Railway Pictures Names Competitions.",
    "Ten solutions the Capting sent in under different names including\nmine because he said 85 Fore Street was a likely address to give a\nprize to The commoner your name and address the more likely you\nwere to get a prize in the Captings opinion.",
    "And sure enough a\nprize I got  but not the 2000 pounds only three new novels  and\nthe kind of novels in my opinion that no one would ever pay money\nfor in a shop.",
    "Narracott smiled then again mentioning that Evans was to wait he\nproceeded on his tour of inspection.",
    "There was a large kind of\ncupboard in one corner of the room.",
    "It was almost a small room in\nitself.",
    "Here packed in unceremoniously were two pairs of skis a\npair of sculls mounted ten or twelve hippopotamus tusks rods and\nlines and various fishing tackle including a book of flies a bag of\ngolf clubs a tennis racket an elephants foot stuffed and mounted\nand a tiger skin.",
    "It was clear that when Captain Trevelyan had let\nSittaford House furnished he had removed his most precious\npossessions distrustful of female influence.",
    "Funny idea  to bring all this with him said the Inspector.",
    "The\nhouse was only let for a few months wasnt it\n\nThats right sir.",
    "Surely these things could have been locked up at Sittaford\nHouse\n\nFor the second time in the course of the interview Evans grinned.",
    "That would have been much the easiest way of doing it he\nagreed.",
    "Not that there are many cupboards at Sittaford House.",
    "The architect and the Capting planned it together and it takes a\nfemale to understand the value of cupboard room.",
    "Still as you say\nsir that would have been the commonsense thing to do.",
    "Carting\nthem down here was a job  I should say it was a job But there the\nCapting couldnt bear the idea of anyone messing around with his\nthings.",
    "And lock things up as you will he says a woman will always\nfind a way of getting in.",
    "Its curiosity he says.",
    "Better not lock them\nup at all if you dont want her to handle them he says.",
    "But best of\nall take them along and then youre sure to be on the safe side.",
    "So\ntake em along we did and as I say it was a job and came\nexpensive too.",
    "But there those things of the Captings was like his\nchildren.",
    "Evans paused out of breath.",
    "Inspector Narracott nodded thoughtfully.",
    "There was another point\non which he wanted information and it seemed to him that this was\na good moment when the subject had arisen naturally.",
    "This Mrs Willett he said casually.",
    "Was she an old friend or\nacquaintance of the Captains\n\nOh no sir she was quite a stranger to him.",
    "You are sure of that said the Inspector sharply.",
    "Well  the sharpness took the old sailor aback.",
    "The Capting\nnever actually said so  but  Oh yes Im sure of it.",
    "I ask explained the Inspector because it is a very curious time\nof year for a let.",
    "On the other hand if this Mrs Willett was\nacquainted with Captain Trevelyan and knew the house she might\nhave written to him and suggested taking it.",
    "Evans shook his head.",
    "Twas the agents  Williamsons  that wrote said they had an offer\nfrom a lady.",
    "Inspector Narracott frowned.",
    "He found this business of the letting\nof Sittaford House distinctly odd.",
    "Captain Trevelyan and Mrs Willett met I suppose he asked.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "She came to see the house and he took her over it.",
    "And youre positive they hadnt met before\n\nOh quite sir.",
    "Did they  er  the Inspector paused as he tried to frame the\nquestion naturallv.",
    "Did they get on well together Were they\nfriendly\n\n\fThe lady was.",
    "A faint smile crossed Evans lips.",
    "All over him as\nyou might say.",
    "Admiring the house and asking him if hed planned\nthe building of it.",
    "Altogether laying it on thick as you might say.",
    "And the Captain\n\nThe smile broadened.",
    "That sort of gushing lady wasnt likely to cut any ice with him.",
    "Polite he was but nothing more.",
    "And declined her invitations.",
    "Invitations\n\nYes to consider the house as his own any time and drop in thats\nhow she put it  drop in.",
    "You dont drop in to a place when youre\nliving six miles away.",
    "She seemed anxious to  well  to see something of the Captain\n\nNarracott was wondering.",
    "Was that the reason for the taking of the\nhouse Was it only a prelude to the making of Captain Trevelyans\nacquaintance Was that the real game It would probably not have\noccurred to her that the Captain would have gone as far as\nExhampton to live.",
    "She might have calculated on his moving into\none of the small bungalows perhaps sharing Major Burnabys.",
    "Evans answer was not very helpful.",
    "Shes a very hospitable lady by all accounts.",
    "Someone in to lunch\nor dinner every day.",
    "Narracott nodded.",
    "He could learn no more here.",
    "But he determined\nto seek an interview with this Mrs Willett at an early date.",
    "Her\nabrupt arrival needed looking into.",
    "Come on Pollock well go upstairs now he said.",
    "They left Evans in the diningroom and proceeded to the upper\nstory.",
    "All right do you think asked the Sergeant in a low voice jerking\nhis head over his shoulder in the direction of the closed diningroom door.",
    "He seems so said the Inspector.",
    "But one never knows.",
    "Hes no\nfool that fellow whatever else he is.",
    "No hes an intelligent sort of chap.",
    "His story seems straightforward enough went on the Inspector.",
    "Perfectly clear and above board.",
    "Still as I say one never knows.",
    "And with this pronouncement very typical of his careful and\nsuspicious mind the Inspector proceeded to search the rooms on\nthe first floor.",
    "There were three bedrooms and a bathroom.",
    "Two of the bedrooms\nwere empty and had clearly not been entered for some weeks.",
    "The\n\n\fthird Captain Trevelyans own room was in exquisite and applepie\norder.",
    "Inspector Narracott moved about in it opening drawers and\ncupboards.",
    "Everything was in its right place.",
    "It was the room of a\nman almost fanatically tidy and neat in his habits.",
    "Narracott\nfinished his inspection and glanced into the adjoining bathroom.",
    "Here too everything was in order.",
    "He gave a last glance at the\nbed neatly turned down with folded pajamas laid ready.",
    "Then he shook his head.",
    "Nothing here he said.",
    "No everything seems in perfect order.",
    "There are the papers in the desk in the study.",
    "You had better go\nthrough those Pollock.",
    "Ill tell Evans that he can go.",
    "I may call\nround and see him at his own place later.",
    "Very good sir.",
    "The body can be removed.",
    "I shall want to see Warren by the way.",
    "He lives near here doesnt he\n\nYes sir.",
    "This side of the Three Crowns or the other\n\nThe other sir.",
    "Then Ill take the Three Crowns first.",
    "Carry on Sergeant.",
    "Pollock went to the diningroom to dismiss Evans.",
    "The Inspector\npassed out of the front door and walked rapidly in the direction of\nthe Three Crowns.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nAT THE THREE CROWNS\n\nInspector Narracott was not destined to see Major Burnaby until he\nhad had a protracted interview with Mrs Belling  licensed\nproprietor of the Three Crowns.",
    "Mrs Belling was fat and excitable\nand so voluble that there was nothing to be done but to listen\npatiently until such time as the stream of conversation should dry\nup.",
    "And such a night as never was she ended up.",
    "And little did any\nof us think what was happening to the poor dear gentleman.",
    "Those\nnasty tramps  if Ive said it once Ive said it a dozen times I cant\nabear those nasty tramps.",
    "Do anybody in they would.",
    "The Captain\nhad not so much as a dog to protect him.",
    "Cant abear a dog tramps\ncant.",
    "Ah well you never know what is happening within a Stones\nthrow.",
    "Yes Mr Narracott she proceeded in answer to his question the\nMajor is having his breakfast now.",
    "You will find him in the coffeeroom.",
    "And what kind of a night he has passed with no pajamas or\nanything and she a widow woman with nothing to lend him I cant\n\n\fsay I am sure.",
    "Said it made no matter he did  all upset and queer\nhe was  and no wonder with his best friend murdered.",
    "Very nice\ngentlemen the two of them though the Captain had the reputation\nof being close with his money.",
    "Ah well well I have always thought\nit dangerous to live up to Sittaford miles away from anywhere and\nheres the Captain struck down in Exhampton itself.",
    "Its always what\nyou dont expect in this life that happens isnt it Mr Narracott\n\nThe Inspector said that undoubtedly it was.",
    "Then he added\n\nWho did you have staying here yesterday Mrs Belling Any\nstrangers\n\nNow let me see.",
    "There was Mr Moresby and Mr Jones commercial gentlemen they are and there was a young gentleman\nfrom London.",
    "Nobody else.",
    "It stands to reason there wouldnt be\nthis time of year.",
    "Very quiet here in the winter.",
    "Oh and there was\nanother young gentleman  arrived by the last train.",
    "Nosy young\nfellow I call him.",
    "He isnt up yet.",
    "The last train said the Inspector.",
    "That gets in at ten oclock eh\nI dont think we need trouble ourselves about him.",
    "What about the\nother  the one from London Did you know him\n\nNever seen him before in my life.",
    "Not a commercial gentleman oh\nno  a cut above that.",
    "I cant remember his name for the moment but youll find it in the register.",
    "Let on the first train to Exeter this\nmorning he did.",
    "Six ten.",
    "Rather curious.",
    "What did he want down\nhere anyway thats what Id like to know.",
    "He didnt mention his business\n\nNot a word.",
    "Did he go out at all\n\nArrived at lunch time went out about half past four and came in\nabout twenty past six.",
    "Where did he go when he went out\n\nI havent the remotest idea sir.",
    "May have been just for a stroll like.",
    "That was before the snow came but it wasnt what you might call a\npleasant day for walking.",
    "Went out at half past four and returned about twenty past six said\nthe Inspector thoughtfully.",
    "Thats rather odd.",
    "He didnt mention\nCaptain Trevelyan\n\nMrs Belling shook her head decisively.",
    "No Mr Narracott he didnt mention anybody at all.",
    "Kept himself to\nhimself he did.",
    "A nice looking young fellow  but worried I should\nsay.",
    "The Inspector nodded and stepped across to inspect the register.",
    "James Pearson London said the Inspector.",
    "Well  that doesnt\ntell us much.",
    "Well have to make a few inquiries about Mr James\nPearson.",
    "Then he strode off to the coffeeroom in search of Major Burnaby.",
    "The Major was the only occupant of the room.",
    "He was drinking\nsome rather muddy looking coffee and the Times was propped up in\nfront of him.",
    "Major Burnaby\n\nThats my name.",
    "I am Inspector Narracott from Exeter.",
    "Good morning Inspector.",
    "Any further\n\nYes sir.",
    "I think we are a little further.",
    "I think I can safely say that.",
    "Glad to hear it said the Major drily.",
    "His attitude was one of\nresigned disbelief.",
    "Now there are just one or two points I would like some information\non Major Burnaby said the Inspector and I think you can\nprobably tell me what I want to know.",
    "Do what I can said Burnaby.",
    "Had Captain Trevelyan any enemies to your knowledge\n\nNot an enemy in the world.",
    "Burnaby was decisive.",
    "This man Evans  do you yourself consider him trustworthy\n\nShould think so.",
    "Trevelyan trusted him I know.",
    "There was no ill feeling about this marriage of his\n\nNot ill feeling no.",
    "Trevelyan was annoyed  didnt like his habits\nupset.",
    "Old bachelor you know.",
    "Talking of bachelors thats another point.",
    "Captain Trevelyan was\nunmarried  do you know if he made a will And in the event of there\nbeing no will have you any idea who would inherit his estate\n\nTrevelyan made a will said Burnaby promptly.",
    "Ah  you know that.",
    "Yes.",
    "Made me executor.",
    "Told me so.",
    "Do you know how he left his money\n\nThat I cant say.",
    "I understand he was very comfortably off.",
    "Trevelyan was a rich man replied Burnaby.",
    "I should say he was\nmuch better off than anyone round here suspected.",
    "What relations had he  do you know\n\n\fHed a sister and some nephews and nieces I believe.",
    "Never saw\nmuch of any of them but there was no quarrel.",
    "About this will do you know where he kept it\n\nIts at Walters  Kirkwood  the solicitors here in Exhampton.",
    "They\ndrew it up for him.",
    "Then perhaps Major Burnaby as you are executor I wonder if\nyou would come round to Walters  Kirkwood with me now.",
    "I should\nlike to have an idea of the contents of that will as soon as possible.",
    "Burnaby looked up alertly.",
    "Whats in the wind he said.",
    "Whats the will got to do with it\n\nInspector Narracott was not disposed to show his hand too soon.",
    "The case isnt such plain sailing as we thought he said.",
    "By the\nway theres another question I want to ask you.",
    "I understand Major\nBurnaby that you asked Dr Warren whether death had occurred at\nfive and twenty minutes past five\n\nWell said the Major gruffly.",
    "What made you select that exact time Major\n\nWhy shouldnt I said Burnaby.",
    "Well  something must have put it into your head.",
    "There was quite a pause before Major Burnaby replied.",
    "Inspector\nNarracotts interest was aroused.",
    "The Major had something which\nhe quite patently wished to conceal.",
    "To watch him doing so was\nalmost ludicrous.",
    "Why shouldnt I say twentyfive past five he demanded\ntruculently or twentyfive to six  or twenty past four for that\nmatter\n\nQuite so sir said Inspector Narracott soothingly.",
    "He did not wish\nto antagonize the Major just at this moment.",
    "He promised himself\nthat he would get to the bottom of the matter before the day was\nout.",
    "Theres one thing that strikes me as curious sir he went on.",
    "Yes\n\nThis business of the letting of Sittaford House.",
    "I dont know what\nyou think about it but it seems to me a curious thing to have\nhappened.",
    "If you ask me said Burnaby its damned odd.",
    "Thats your opinion\n\nIts everyones opinion.",
    "In Sittaford\n\n\fIn Sittaford and Exhampton too.",
    "The woman must be mad.",
    "Well I suppose theres no accounting for tastes said the\nInspector.",
    "Damned odd taste for a woman of that kind.",
    "You know the lady\n\nI know her.",
    "Why I was at her house when \n\nWhen what asked Narracott as the Major came to an abrupt halt.",
    "Nothing said Burnaby.",
    "Inspector Narracott looked at him keenly.",
    "There was something\nhere he would have liked to get at.",
    "The Majors obvious confusion\nand embarrassment did not escape him.",
    "He had been on the point\nof saying  what\n\nAll in good time said Narracott to himself.",
    "Now isnt the moment\nto rub him up the wrong way.",
    "Aloud he said innocently\n\nYou were at Sittaford House you say sir.",
    "The lady has been there\nnow  about how long\n\nA couple of months.",
    "The Major was eager to escape the result of his imprudent words.",
    "It\nmade him more loquacious than usual.",
    "A widow lady with her daughter\n\nThats it.",
    "Does she give any reason for her choice of residence\n\nWell  the Major rubbed his nose dubiously.",
    "She talks a lot shes\nthat kind of woman  beauties of nature  out of the world  that sort\nof thing.",
    "But \n\nHe paused rather helplessly.",
    "Inspector Narracott came to his\nrescue.",
    "It didnt strike you as natural on her part.",
    "Well its like this.",
    "Shes a fashionable sort of woman.",
    "Dressed up\nto the nines  daughters a smart pretty girl.",
    "Natural thing would be\nfor them to be staying at the Ritz or Claridges or some other big\nhotel somewhere.",
    "You know the sort.",
    "Narracott nodded.",
    "They dont keep themselves to themselves do they he asked.",
    "You dont think they are  well  hiding\n\nMajor Burnaby shook his head positively.",
    "Oh no nothing of that kind.",
    "Theyre very sociable  a bit too\nsociable.",
    "I mean in a little place like Sittaford you cant have\nprevious engagements and when invitations are showered on you\nits a bit awkward.",
    "Theyre exceedingly kind hospitable people but\na bit too hospitable for English ideas.",
    "The Colonial touch said the Inspector.",
    "Yes I suppose so.",
    "Youve no reason to think they were previously acquainted with\nCaptain Trevelyan\n\nSure they werent.",
    "You seem very positive\n\nJoe would have told me.",
    "And you dont think their motive could have been  well  to scrape\nacquaintance with the Captain\n\nThis was clearly a new idea to the Major.",
    "He pondered over it for\nsome minutes.",
    "Well I never thought of that.",
    "They were very gushing to him\ncertainly.",
    "Not that they got any change out of Joe.",
    "But no I think it\nwas just their usual manner.",
    "Over friendly you know like Colonials\nare added the Super Insular soldier.",
    "I see.",
    "Now as to the house itself.",
    "Captain Trevelyan built that I\nunderstand\n\nYes.",
    "And nobody else has ever lived in it I mean its not been let\nbefore\n\nNever.",
    "Then it doesnt seem as though it could be anything in the house\nitself that was the attraction.",
    "Its a puzzle.",
    "Ten to one its got\nnothing to do with the case but it just struck me as an odd\ncoincidence.",
    "This house that Captain Trevelyan took Hazelmoor\nwhose property was that\n\nMiss Larpents.",
    "Middleaged woman shes gone to a boarding\nhouse at Cheltenham for the winter.",
    "Does every year.",
    "Usually shuts\nthe house up but lets it if she can which isnt often.",
    "There seemed nothing promising there.",
    "The Inspector shook his\nhead in a discouraged fashion.",
    "Williamsons were the agents I understand he said.",
    "Yes.",
    "Their office is in Exhampton\n\n\fNext door to Walters  Kirkwood.",
    "Ah then perhaps if you dont mind Major we might just drop in\non our way.",
    "Not at all.",
    "You wont find Kirkwood at his office before ten anyway.",
    "You know what lawyers are.",
    "Then shall we go\n\nThe Major who had finished his breakfast some time ago nodded\nassent and rose.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nTHE WILL\n\nAn alert looking young man rose to receive them in the office of\nMessrs. Williamson.",
    "Good morning Major Burnaby.",
    "Morning.",
    "Terrible business this said the young man chattily.",
    "Not been\nsuch a thing in Exhampton for years.",
    "He spoke with gusto and the Major winced.",
    "This is Inspector Narracott he said.",
    "Oh yes said the young man pleasurably excited.",
    "I want some information that I think you can give me said the\nInspector.",
    "I understand that you put through this let of Sittaford\nHouse.",
    "To Mrs Willet Yes we did.",
    "Can you give me full details please of how that came about.",
    "Did\nthe lady apply personally or by letter\n\nBy letter.",
    "She wrote let me see  He opened a drawer and turned\nup a file.",
    "Yes from the Carlton Hotel London.",
    "Did she mention Sittaford House by name\n\nNo she merely said she wanted to rent a house for the winter it\nmust be right on Dartmoor and have at least eight bedrooms.",
    "Being\nnear a railway station or a town was of no consequence.",
    "Was Sittaford House on your books\n\nNo it was not.",
    "But as a matter of fact it was the only house in the\nneighborhood that at all fulfilled the requirements.",
    "The lady\nmentioned in her letter that she would be willing to go to twelve\nguineas and in these circumstances I thought it worth while writing\n\n\fto Captain Trevelyan and asking whether he would consider letting.",
    "He replied in the affirmative and we fixed the thing up.",
    "Without Mrs Willett seeing the house\n\nShe agreed to take it without seeing it and signed the agreement.",
    "Then she came down here for one day drove up to Sittaford saw\nCaptain Trevelyan arranged with him about plate and linen etc.",
    "and saw over the house.",
    "She was quite satisfied\n\nShe came in and said she was delighted with it.",
    "And what did you think asked Inspector Narracott eyeing him\nkeenly.",
    "The young man shrugged his shoulders.",
    "You learn never to be surprised at anything in the house\nbusiness he said.",
    "On this note of philosophy they left the Inspector thanking the\nyoung man for his help.",
    "Not at all a pleasure Im sure.",
    "He accompanied them politely to the door.",
    "The offices of Messrs. Walters  Kirkwood were as Major Burnaby\nhad said next door to the estate agents.",
    "On reaching there they\nwere told that Mr Kirkwood had just arrived and they were shown\ninto his room.",
    "Mr Kirkwood was an elderly man with a benign expression.",
    "He was\na native of Exhampton and had succeeded his father and\ngrandfather in the firm.",
    "He rose put on his mourning face and shook hands with the Major.",
    "Good morning Major Burnaby he said.",
    "This is a very shocking\naffair.",
    "Very shocking indeed.",
    "Poor Trevelyan.",
    "He looked inquiringly at Narracott and Major Burnaby explained his\npresence in a few succinct words.",
    "You are in charge of the case Inspector Narracott\n\nYes Mr Kirkwood.",
    "In pursuance of my investigations I have come\nto ask you for certain information.",
    "I shall be happy to give you any information if it is proper for me to\ndo so said the lawyer.",
    "It concerns the late Captain Trevelyans will said Narracott.",
    "I\nunderstand the will is here in your office.",
    "That is so.",
    "It was made some time ago\n\nFive or six years ago.",
    "I cannot be sure of the exact date at the\nmoment.",
    "Ah I am anxious Mr Kirkwood to know the contents of that will as\nsoon as possible.",
    "It may have an important bearing on the case.",
    "Indeed said the lawyer.",
    "Indeed I should not have thought that\nbut naturally you know your own business best Inspector.",
    "Well \nhe glanced across at the other man.",
    "Major Burnaby and myself are\njoint executors of the will.",
    "If he has no objection \n\nNone.",
    "Then I see no reason why I should not accede to your request\nInspector.",
    "Taking up a telephone that stood on his desk he spoke a few words\ndown it.",
    "In two or three minutes a clerk entered the room and laid a\nsealed envelope in front of the lawyer.",
    "The clerk left the room Mr\nKirkwood picked up the envelope slit it open with a paper knife and\ndrew out a large and important looking document cleared his\nthroat and began to read\n\nI Joseph Arthur Trevelyan of Sittaford House Sittaford in the\nCounty of Devon declare this to be my last will and testament\nwhich I make this thirteenth day of August nineteen hundred and\ntwentysix.",
    "1 I appoint John Edward Burnaby of The Cottages Sittaford and\nFrederick Kirkwood of Exhampton to be the executors and trustees\nof this my will.",
    "2 I give to Robert Henry Evans who has served me long and\nfaithfully the sum of one hundred pounds free of legacy duty for his\nown benefit absolutely provided that he is in my service at the time\nof my death and not under notice to leave whether given or\nreceived.",
    "3 I give the said John Edward Burnaby as a token of our\nfriendship and of my affection and regard for him all my trophies of\nsport including my collection of heads and pelts of big game as\nwell as any challenge cups and prizes awarded to me in any\ndepartment of sport and any spoils of the chase in my possession.",
    "4 I give all my real and personal property not otherwise disposed\nof by this my will or any codicil hereto to my Trustees upon Trust\nthat my Trustees shall sell call in and convert the same into money.",
    "5 My Trustees shall out of the moneys to arise out of such sale\ncalling in and conversion pay any funeral and testamentary\nexpenses and debts and the legacies given by this my will or any\ncodicil hereto and all death duties and other moneys.",
    "6 My Trustees shall hold the residue of such moneys or the\ninvestments for the time being representing the same upon Trust\nto divide the same into four equal parts or shares.",
    "7 Upon such division as aforesaid my Trustees shall hold one\nsuch equal fourth part or share upon Trust to pay the same to my\nsister Jennifer Gardner for her own use and enjoyment absolutely.",
    "And my Trustees shall hold the remaining three such equal fourth\nparts or shares upon Trust to pay one such equal fourth part or\nshare to each of the three children of my deceased sister Mary\nPearson for the benefit of each such child absolutely.",
    "In Witness whereof I the said Joseph Arthur Trevelyan have\nhereunto set my hand the day and year first above written.",
    "Signed by the above named Testator as his last will in the\npresence of us both present at the same time who in his presence\nand at his request and in the presence of each other have hereunto\nsubscribed our names as witness\n\nMr Kirkwood handed the document to the Inspector.",
    "Witnessed by two of my clerks in this office.",
    "The Inspector ran his eye over the will thoughtfully.",
    "My deceased sister Mary Pearson he said.",
    "Can you tell me\nanything about Mrs Pearson Mr Kirkwood\n\nVery little.",
    "She died about ten years ago I believe.",
    "Her husband a\nstockbroker had predeceased her.",
    "As far as I know she never\nvisited Captain Trevelyan here.",
    "Pearson said the Inspector again.",
    "Then he added One thing\nmore.",
    "The amount of Captain Trevelyans estate is not mentioned.",
    "To what sum do you think it will amount\n\nThat is difficult to say exactly said Mr Kirkwood enjoying like all\nlawyers making the reply to a simple question difficult.",
    "It is a\nquestion of real or personal estate.",
    "Besides Sittaford House\nCaptain Trevelyan owns some property in the neighborhood of\nPlymouth and various investments he made from time to time have\nfluctuated in value.",
    "I just want an approximate idea said Inspector Narracott.",
    "I should not like to commit myself.",
    "Just the roughest estimate as a guide.",
    "For instance would twenty\nthousand pounds be out of the way\n\nTwenty thousand pounds.",
    "My dear sir Captain Trevelyans estate\nwill be worth at least four times as much as that.",
    "Eighty or even\nninety thousand pounds will be much nearer the mark.",
    "I told you Trevelyan was a rich man said Burnaby.",
    "Inspector Narracott rose.",
    "Thank you very much Mr Kirkwood he said for the information\nyou have given me.",
    "You think you will find it helpful eh\n\nThe laywer very clearly was agog with curiosity but Inspector\nNarracott was in no mood to satisfy it at present.",
    "In a case like this we have to take everything into account he\nsaid noncommittally.",
    "By the way have you the names and\naddresses of this Jennifer Gardner and of the Pearson family\n\nI know nothing of the Pearson family.",
    "Mrs Gardners address is\nThe Laurels Waldon Road Exeter.",
    "The Inspector noted it down in his book.",
    "That will do to get on with he said.",
    "You dont know how many\nchildren the late Mrs Pearson left\n\nThree I fancy.",
    "Two girls and a boy  or possibly two boys and a girl\n I cannot remember which.",
    "The Inspector nodded and put away his notebook and thanked the\nlawyer once more and took his departure.",
    "When they had reached the street he turned suddenly and faced\nhis companion.",
    "And now sir he said well have the truth about that twentyfive\npast five business.",
    "Major Burnabys face reddened with annoyance.",
    "I have told you already \n\nThat wont go down with me.",
    "Withholding information that is what\nyou are doing Major Burnaby.",
    "You must have had some idea in\nmentioning that specific time to Dr Warren  and I think I have a very\ngood idea of what that something is.",
    "Well if you know about it why ask me growled the Major.",
    "I take it that you were aware that a certain person had an\nappointment with Captain Trevelyan somewhere about that time.",
    "Now isnt that so\n\nMajor Burnaby stared at him in surprise.",
    "Nothing of the kind he snarled nothing of the kind.",
    "Be careful Major Burnaby.",
    "What about Mr James Pearson\n\nJames Pearson James Pearson whos he Do you mean one of\nTrevelyans nephews\n\nI presume it would be a nephew.",
    "He had one called James hadnt\nhe\n\nNot the least idea.",
    "Trevelyan had nephews  I know that.",
    "But what\ntheir names were I havent the vaguest idea.",
    "The young man in question was at the Three Crowns last night.",
    "You probably recognized him there.",
    "I didnt recognize anybody growled the Major.",
    "Shouldnt anyway\n never saw any of Trevelyans nephews in my life.",
    "But you knew that Captain Trevelyan was expecting a nephew to\ncall upon him yesterday afternoon\n\nI did not roared the Major.",
    "Several people in the street turned round to stare at him.",
    "Damn it wont you take plain truth I knew nothing about any\nappointment.",
    "Trevelyans nephews may have been in Timbuctoo for\nall I knew about them.",
    "Inspector Narracott was a little taken aback.",
    "The Majors vehement\ndenial bore the mark of truth too plainly for him to be deceived.",
    "Then why this twentyfive past five business\n\nOh well  I suppose I had better tell you the Major coughed in an\nembarrassed fashion.",
    "But mind you  the whole thing is damned\nfoolishness Tommy rot sir.",
    "How any thinking man can believe such\nnonsense\n\nInspector Narracott looked more and more surprised.",
    "Major Burnaby was looking more uncomfortable and ashamed of\nhimself every minute.",
    "You know what it is Inspector.",
    "You have to join in these things to\nplease a lady.",
    "Of course I never thought there was anything in it.",
    "In what Major Burnaby\n\nTable turning.",
    "Table turning\n\nWhatever Narracott had expected he had not expected this.",
    "The\nMajor proceeded to explain himself.",
    "Haltingly and with many\ndisclaimers to his own belief in the thing he described the events of\nthe previous afternoon and the message that had purported to\ncome through for himself.",
    "You mean Major Burnaby that the table spelt out the name of\nTrevelyan and informed you that he was dead  murdered\n\nMajor Burnaby wiped his forehead.",
    "Yes thats what happened.",

    "It was the first well\nauthenticated case he had come across.",
    "A very queer business altogether but as far as he could see\nthough it explained Major Burnabys attitude it had no practical\nbearing on the case as far as he himself was concerned.",
    "He had to\ndeal with the physical world and not the psychic.",
    "It was his job to track down the murderer.",
    "And to do that he required no guidance from the spirit world.",

    "You cannot very well tell him to go to the devil.",
    "No enemies had he asked the young man.",
    "No said the Major.",
    "But I hear the police dont think it is robbery went on Enderby.",
    "How do you know that asked the Major.",
    "Mr Enderby however did not reveal the source of his information.",

    "Yes.",
    "It must have been an awful shock.",
    "The conversation proceeded.",
    "Major Burnaby was still determined\nto give no information but he was no match for the adroitness of Mr\nEnderby.",
    "The latter made statements with which the Major was\nforced to agree or disagree thereby providing the information the\nyoung man wanted.",

    "Just so said Inspector Narracott.",
    "The maid ushered him into the drawingroom  a room which like\nthe outside of the house was badly in need of a little money spent\nupon it but yet had with all that an air of charm which the\nInspector felt without being able to particularize the why and\nwherefore of it.",

    "Oh of course you couldnt be expected to know said the nurse\ngraciously.",
    "Is Mr Gardner dangerously ill inquired the Inspector.",
    "Its a sad case said the nurse.",
    "Of course in a manner of\nspeaking theres nothing the matter with him really.",
    "Hes lost the\nuse of his limbs entirely through nervous shock.",
    "Theres no visible\ndisability.",
    "He had no extra strain or shock yesterday afternoon inquired\nthe Inspector.",
    "Not that I know of the nurse looked somewhat surprised.",
    "You were with him all the afternoon\n\nI intended to be but well  as a matter of fact Captain Gardner\nwas very anxious for me to change two books for him at the library.",
    "He had forgotten to ask his wife before she went out.",
    "So to oblige\nhim I went out with them and he asked me at the same time to get\none or two other little things for him  presents for his wife as a\nmatter of fact.",

    "Think this old\nfellow was telling the truth Thats the sort of story that gets\ncooked up afterwards by those believers in spooks and things of\nthat kind.",
    "I fancy its true all right said Narracott with a grin.",
    "I had a lot of\ndifficulty getting it out of him.",
    "Hes not a believer  just the opposite old soldier all damned nonsense attitude.",
    "The Superintendent nodded his comprehension.",
    "Well its odd but it doesnt get us anywhere was his conclusion.",
    "Then Ill take the 1.45 to London.",
    "The other nodded.",
    "On arrival in town Narracott went straight to 21 Cromwell Street.",
    "Mr\nPearson he was told was at the office.",
    "He would be back for\ncertain about seven oclock.",
    "Narracott nodded carelessly as though the information were of no\nvalue to him.",
    "Ill call back if I can he said.",
    "Its nothing of importance and\ndeparted quickly without leaving a name.",
    "He decided not to go to the Insurance Office but to visit Wimbledon\ninstead and have an interview with Mrs Martin Dering formerly Miss\nSylvia Pearson.",
    "There were no signs of shabbiness about The Nook.",
    "New and\nshoddy was how Inspector Narracott described it to himself.",
    "Mrs Dering was at home.",
    "A rather pertlooking maid dressed in lilac\ncolor showed him into a rather overcrowded drawingroom.",
    "He\ngave her his official card to take to her mistress.",
    "Mrs Dering came to him almost immediately his card in her hand.",
    "I suppose you have come abo ut poor Uncle Joseph was her\ngreeting.",
    "Its shocking  really shocking I am so dreadfully\nnervous of burglars myself.",
    "I had two extra bolts put on the back\ndoor last week and new patent catches on the windows.",
    "Sylvia Dering the Inspector knew from Mrs Gardner was only\ntwentyfive but she looked considerably over thirty.",
    "She was small\nand fair and anemic looking with a worried and harassed\nexpression.",
    "Her voice had that faintly complaining note in it which\nis about the most annoying sound a human voice can contain still\nnot allowing the Inspector to speak she went on\n\n\fIf theres anything I can do to help you in any way of course I shall\nbe only too glad to do so but one hardly ever saw Uncle Joseph.",
    "He\nwasnt a very nice man  I am sure he couldnt have been.",
    "Not the\nsort of person one could go to in trouble always carping and\ncriticizing.",
    "Not the sort of man who had any knowledge of what\nliterature meant.",
    "Success  true success is not always measured in\nterms of money Inspector.",
    "At last she paused and the Inspector to whom those remarks had\nopened certain fields of conjecture was given his turn to speak.",
    "Youve heard of the tragedy very quickly Mrs Dering.",
    "Aunt Jennifer wired it to me.",
    "I see.",
    "But I suppose it will be in the evening papers.",
    "Dreadful isnt it\n\nI gather youve not seen your uncle of late years.",
    "I have only seen him twice since my marriage.",
    "On the second\noccasion he was really very rude to Martin.",
    "Of course he was a\nregular philistine in every way  devoted to sport.",
    "No appreciation\nas I said just now of literature.",
    "Husband applied to him for a loan and got refused was Inspector\nNarracotts private comment on the situation.",
    "Just as a matter of form Mrs Dering will you tell me what your\nmovements were yesterday afternoon\n\nMy movements What a very queer way of putting it Inspector.",
    "I\nplayed bridge most of the afternoon and a friend came in and spent\nthe evening with me as my husband was out.",
    "Out was he Away from home altogether\n\nA literary dinner explained Mrs Dering with importance.",
    "He\nlunched with an American publisher and had this dinner in the\nevening.",
    "I see.",
    "That seemed quite fair and above board.",
    "He went on.",
    "Your younger brother is in Australia I believe Mrs Dering\n\nYes.",
    "You have his address\n\nOh yes I can find it for you if you wish  rather a peculiar name Ive forgotten it for the minute.",
    "Somewhere in New South Wales.",
    "And now Mrs Dering your elder brother\n\nJim\n\n\fYes.",
    "I shall want to get in touch with him.",
    "Mrs Dering hastened to supply him with the address  the same as\nthat which Mrs Gardner had already given him.",
    "Then feeling there was no more to be said on either side he cut the\ninterview short.",
    "Glancing at his watch he noted that by the time he had returned to\ntown it would be seven oclock  a likely time he hoped for finding\nMr James Pearson at home.",
    "The same superior looking middleaged woman opened the door of\nNo.",
    "21.",
    "Yes Mr Pearson was at home now.",
    "It was on the second\nfloor if the gentleman would walk up.",
    "She preceded him tapped at a door and in a murmured and\napologetic voice said The gentleman to see you sir.",
    "Then\nstanding back she allowed the Inspector to enter.",
    "A young man in evening dress was standing in the middle of the\nroom.",
    "He was goodlooking indeed handsome if you took no\naccount of the rather weak mouth and the irresolute slant of the\neyes.",
    "He had a haggard worried look and an air of not having had\nmuch sleep of late.",
    "He looked inquiringly at the Inspector as the latter advanced.",
    "I am Detective Inspector Narracott he began  but got no further.",
    "With a hoarse cry the young man dropped on to a chair flung his\narms out in front of him on the table bowing his head on them and\nmuttering\n\nOh my God Its come.",
    "After a minute or two he lifted his head and said\n\nWell why dont you get on with it man\n\nInspector Narracott looked exceedingly stolid and unintelligent.",
    "I am investigating the death of your uncle Captain Joseph\nTrevelyan.",
    "May I ask you sir if you have anything to say\n\nThe young man rose slowly to his feet and said in a low strained\nvoice\n\nAre you  arresting me\n\nNo sir I am not.",
    "If I was arresting you I would give you the\ncustomary caution.",
    "I am simply asking you to account for your\nmovements yesterday afternoon.",
    "You may reply to my questions or\nnot as you see fit.",
    "And if I dont reply to them  it will tell against me.",
    "Oh yes I know\nyour little ways.",
    "Youve found out then that I was down there\nyesterday\n\nYou signed your name in the hotel register Mr Pearson.",
    "Oh I suppose theres no use denying it.",
    "I was there  why shouldnt\nI be\n\nWhy indeed said the Inspector mildly.",
    "I went down there to see my uncle.",
    "By appointment\n\nWhat do you mean by appointment\n\nDid your uncle know you were coming\n\nI  no  he didnt.",
    "It  it was a sudden impulse.",
    "No reason for it\n\nI  reason No  no why should there be I  I just wanted to see my\nuncle.",
    "Quite so sir.",
    "And you did see him\n\nThere was a pause  a very long pause.",
    "Indecision was written on\nevery feature of the young mans face.",
    "Inspector Narracott felt a\nkind of pity as he watched him.",
    "Couldnt the boy see that his\npalpable indecision was as good as an admission of the fact\n\nAt last Jim Pearson drew a deep breath.",
    "I  I suppose I had better\nmake a clean breast of it.",
    "Yes  I did see him.",
    "I asked at the station\n\n\fhow I could get to Sittaford.",
    "They told me it was out of the question.",
    "The roads were impassable for any vehicle.",
    "I said it was urgent.",
    "Urgent murmured the Inspector.",
    "I  I wanted to see my uncle very much.",
    "So it seems sir.",
    "The porter continued to shake his head and say that it was\nimpossible.",
    "I mentioned my uncles name and at once his face\ncleared up and he told me my uncle was actually in Exhampton\nand gave me full directions as to how to find the house he had\nrented.",
    "This was at what time sir\n\nAbout one oclock I think.",
    "I went to the Inn  the Three Crowns booked a room and had some lunch there.",
    "Then afterwards I  I\nwent out to see my uncle.",
    "Immediately afterwards\n\nNo not immediately.",
    "What time was it\n\nWell I couldnt say for certain.",
    "Half past three Four oclock Half past four\n\n\fI  I  he stammered worse than ever.",
    "I dont think it could have\nbeen as late as that.",
    "Mrs Belling the proprietress said you went out at half past four.",
    "Did I I  I think shes wrong.",
    "It couldnt have been as late as that.",
    "What happened next\n\nI found my uncles house had a talk with him and came back to the\nInn.",
    "How did you get into your uncles house\n\nI rang the bell and he opened the door to me himself.",
    "Wasnt he surprised to see you\n\nYes  yes  he was rather surprised.",
    "How long did you remain with him Mr Pearson\n\nA quarter of an hour  twenty minutes.",
    "But look here he was\nperfectly all right when I left him.",
    "Perfectly all right.",
    "I swear it.",
    "And what time did you leave him\n\nThe young man lowered his eyes.",
    "Again the hesitation was\npalpable in his tone I dont know exactly.",
    "I think you do Mr Pearson.",
    "The assured tone had its effect.",
    "The boy replied in a low tone.",
    "It was a quarter past five.",
    "You returned to the Three Crowns at a quarter to six.",
    "At most it\ncould only take you seven or eight minutes to walk over from your\nuncles house.",
    "I didnt go straight back.",
    "I walked about the town.",
    "In that icy weather  in the snow\n\nIt wasnt actually snowing then.",
    "It came on to snow later.",
    "I see.",
    "And what was the nature of your conversation with your\nuncle\n\nOh nothing in particular.",
    "I  I just wanted to talk to the old boy\nlook him up that sort of thing you know.",
    "Hes a poor liar thought Inspector Narracott to himself.",
    "Why I\ncould manage better than that myself.",
    "Aloud he said\n\n\fVery good sir.",
    "Now may I ask you why on hearing of your uncles\nmurder you left Exhampton without disclosing your relationship to\nthe murdered man\n\nI was scared said the young man frankly.",
    "I heard he had been\nmurdered round about the time I left him.",
    "Now dash it all thats\nenough to scare anyone isnt it I got the wind up and left the place\nby the first available train.",
    "Oh I dare say I was a fool to do anything\nof the sort.",
    "But you know what it is when you are rattled.",
    "And\nanyone might have been rattled under these circumstances.",
    "And thats all you have to say sir\n\nYes  yes of course.",
    "Then perhaps youll have no objection sir to coming round with\nme and having this statement taken down in writing after which\nyou will have it read over to you and you will sign it.",
    "Is  is that all\n\nI think it possible Mr Pearson that it may be necessary to detain\nyou until after the inquest.",
    "Oh my God said Jim Pearson.",
    "Can nobody help me\n\nAt that moment the door opened and a young woman walked into\nthe room.",
    "She was as the observant Inspector Narracott noted at once a\nvery exceptional kind of young woman.",
    "She was not strikingly\nbeautiful but she had a face which was arresting and unusual a\nface that having once seen you could not forget.",
    "There was about\nher an atmosphere of common sense savoirfaire invincible\ndetermination and a most tantalizing fascination.",
    "Oh Jim she exclaimed Whats happened\n\nIts all over Emily said the young man.",
    "They think I murdered my\nuncle.",
    "Who thinks so demanded Emily.",
    "The young man indicated his visitor by a gesture.",
    "This is Inspector Narracott he said and he added with a dismal\nattempt at introduction Miss Emily Trefusis.",
    "Oh said Emily Trefusis.",
    "She studied Inspector Narracott with keen hazel eyes.",
    "Jim she said is a frightful idiot.",
    "But he doesnt murder people.",
    "The Inspector said nothing.",
    "I expect said Emily turning to Jim that youve been saying the\nmost frightfully imprudent things.",
    "If youd read the papers a little\nbetter than you do Jim you would know that you must never talk to\n\n\fpolicemen unless you have a strong solicitor sitting beside you\nmaking objections to every word.",
    "Whats happened Are you\narresting him Inspector Narracott\n\nInspector Narracott explained technically and clearly exactly what\nhe was doing.",
    "Emily cried the young man you wont believe I did it You never\nwill believe it will you\n\nNo darling said Emily kindly.",
    "Of course not.",
    "And she added in\na gentle meditative tone You havent got the guts.",
    "I dont feel as if I had a friend in the world groaned Jim.",
    "Yes you have said Emily.",
    "Youve got me.",
    "Cheer up Jim look at\nthe winking diamonds on the third finger of my left hand.",
    "Here\nstands the faithful fianc\u0439e.",
    "Go with the Inspector and leave\neverything to me.",
    "Jim Pearson rose still with a dazed expression on his face.",
    "His\novercoat was lying over a chair and he put it on.",
    "Inspector\nNarracott handed him a hat which was lying on a bureau near by.",
    "They moved towards the door and the Inspector said politely\n\nGood evening Miss Trefusis.",
    "Au revoir Inspector said Emily sweetly.",
    "And if he had known Miss Emily Trefusis better he would have\nknown that in these three words lay a challenge.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nEMILY SETS TO WORK\n\nThe inquest on the body of Captain Trevelyan was held on Monday\nmorning.",
    "From the point of view of sensation it was a tame affair for\nit was almost immediately adjourned for a week thus disappointing\nlarge\n\nnumbers\n\nof\n\npeople.",
    "Between\n\nSaturday\n\nand\n\nMonday\n\nExhampton had sprung into fame.",
    "The knowledge that the dead\nmans nephew had been detained in connection with the murder\nmade the whole affair spring from a mere paragraph in the back\npages of the newspapers to gigantic headlines.",
    "On the Monday\nreporters had arrived at Exhampton in large numbers.",
    "Mr Charles\nEnderby had reason once more to congratulate himself on the\nsuperior position he had obtained from the purely fortuitous chance\nof the football competition prize.",
    "It was the journalists intention to stick to Major Burnaby like a\nleech.",
    "And under the pretext of photographing the latters cottage\nto obtain exclusive information of the inhabitants of Sittaford and\ntheir relations with the dead man.",
    "It did not escape Mr Enderbys notice that at lunch time a small\ntable near the door was occupied by a very attractive girl.",
    "Mr\nEnderby wondered what she was doing in Exhampton.",
    "She was well\n\n\fdressed in a demure and provocative style and did not appear to\nbe a relation of the deceased and still less could be labeled as one\nof the idle curious.",
    "I wonder how long shes staying thought Mr Enderby.",
    "Rather a\npity I am going up to Sittaford this afternoon.",
    "Just my luck.",
    "Well\nyou cant have it both ways I suppose.",
    "But shortly after lunch Mr Enderby received an agreeable surprise.",
    "He was standing on the steps of the Three Crowns observing the\nfast melting snow and enjoying the sluggish rays of wintry\nsunshine when he was aware of a voice an extremely charming\nvoice addressing him.",
    "I beg your pardon  but could you tell me  if there is anything to\nsee in Exhampton\n\nCharles Enderby rose to the occasion promptly.",
    "Theres a castle I believe he said.",
    "Not much to it  but there it is.",
    "Perhaps you would allow me to show you the way to it.",
    "That would be frightfully kind of you said the girl.",
    "If you are sure\nyou are not too busy \n\nCharles Enderby disclaimed immediately the notion of being busy.",
    "They set out together.",
    "You are Mr Enderby arent you said the girl.",
    "Yes.",
    "How did you know\n\nMrs Belling pointed you out to me.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "My name is Emily Trefusis.",
    "Mr Enderby  I want you to help me.",
    "To help you said Enderby.",
    "Why certainly  but \n\nYou see I am engaged to Jim Pearson.",
    "Oh said Mr Enderby journalistic possibilities rising before his\nmind.",
    "And the police are going to arrest him.",
    "I know they are.",
    "Mr\nEnderby I know that Jim didnt do this thing.",
    "I am down here to\nprove he didnt.",
    "But I must have someone to help me.",
    "One cant do\nanything without a man.",
    "Men know so much and are able to get\ninformation in so many ways that are simply impossible to women.",
    "Well  I  yes I suppose that is true said Mr Enderby\ncomplacently.",
    "I was looking at all these journalists this morning said Emily.",
    "Such a lot of them I thought had such stupid faces.",
    "I picked you out\nas the one really clever one among them.",
    "Oh I say.",
    "I dont think thats true you know said Mr Enderby still\nmore complacently.",
    "What I want to propose said Emily Trefusis is a kind of\npartnership.",
    "There would I think be advantages on both sides.",
    "There are certain things I want to investigate  to find out about.",
    "There you in your charaeter of journalist can help me.",
    "I want \n\nEmily paused.",
    "What she really wanted was to engage Mr Enderby\nas a kind of private sleuth of her own.",
    "To go where she told him to\nask the questions she wanted asked and in general to be a kind of\nbond slave.",
    "But she was aware of the necessity of couching these\nproposals in terms at once flattering and agreeable.",
    "The whole\npoint was that she was to be the boss but the matter needed\nmanaging tactfully.",
    "I want said Emily to feel that I can depend upon you.",
    "She had a lovely voice liquid and alluring.",
    "As she uttered the last\nsentence a feeling rose in Mr Enderbys bosom that this lovely\nhelpless girl could depend upon him to the last ditch.",
    "It must be ghastly said Mr Enderby and taking her hand he\nsqueezed it with fervor.",
    "But you know he went on with a journalistic reaction my time is\nnot entirely my own.",
    "I mean I have got to go where I am sent and\nall that.",
    "Yes said Emily.",
    "I have thought of that and that you see is where\nI come in.",
    "Surely I am what you call a scoop arent I You can do\nan interview with me every day you can make me say anything that\nyou think your readers will like.",
    "Jim Pearsons fianc\u0439e.",
    "Girl who\nbelieves passionately in his innocence.",
    "Reminiscences of his\nchildhood which she supplies.",
    "I dont really know about his\nchildhood you know she added but that doesnt matter.",
    "I think said Mr Enderby that you are marvelous.",
    "You really are\nmarvelous.",
    "And then said Emily pursuing her advantage I have access\nnaturally to Jims relations.",
    "I can get you in there as a friend of\nmine where quite possibly you might have the door shut in your\nface any other way.",
    "Dont I know that only too well said Mr Enderby with feeling\nrecalling various rebuffs of the past.",
    "A glorious prospect opened out before him.",
    "He had been in luck\nover this affair all round.",
    "First the lucky chance of the football\ncompetition and now this.",
    "Its a deal he said fervently.",
    "Good said Emily becoming brisk and businesslike.",
    "Now whats\nthe first move\n\nIm going up to Sittaford this afternoon.",
    "He explained the fortunate circumstance which had put him in such\nan advantageous position with regard to Major Burnaby.",
    "Because\nmind you he is the kind of old buffer that hates newspaper men like\npoison.",
    "But you cant push a chap in the face who has just handed\nyou 5000 pounds can you\n\nIt would be awkward said Emily.",
    "Well if you are going to\nSittaford I am coming with you.",
    "Splendid said Mr Enderby.",
    "I dont know though if theres\nanywhere to stay up there.",
    "As far as I know theres only Sittaford\nHouse and a few odd cottages belonging to people like Burnaby.",
    "We shall find something said Emily.",
    "I always find something.",
    "Mr Enderby could well believe that.",
    "Emily had the kind of\npersonality that soars triumphantly over all obstacles.",
    "They had arrived by now at the ruined castle but paying no\nattention to it they sat down on a piece of wall in the socalled\nsunshine and Emily proceeded to develop her ideas.",
    "I am looking at this Mr Enderby in an absolutely unsentimental\nand businesslike way.",
    "Youve got to take it from me to begin with\nthat Jim didnt do the murder.",
    "Im not saying that simply because I\nam in love with him or believe in his beautiful character or anything\nlike that.",
    "Its just  well  knowledge.",
    "You see I have been on my own\npretty well since I was sixteen.",
    "I have never come into contact with\nmany women and I know very little about them but I know really a\nlot about men.",
    "And unless a girl can size up a man pretty\n\n\faccurately and know whats shes got to deal with she will never\nget on.",
    "I have got on.",
    "I work as a mannequin at Lucies and I can\ntell you Mr Enderby that to arrive there is a feat.",
    "Well as I was saying I can size up men pretty accurately.",
    "Jim is\nrather a weak character in many ways.",
    "I am not sure said Emily\nforgetting for a moment her r\u0444le of admirer of strong men that\nthats not why I like him.",
    "The feeling that I can run him and make\nsomething of him.",
    "There are quite a lot of  well  even criminal\nthings that I can imagine him doing if pushed to it  but not murder.",
    "He simply couldnt pick up a sandbag and hit an old man on the\nback of the neck with it.",
    "He would make a bosh shot and hit him in\nthe wrong place if he did.",
    "He is a  he is a gentle creature Mr\nEnderby.",
    "He doesnt even like killing wasps.",
    "He always tries to put\nthem out of a window without hurting them and usually gets stung.",
    "However its no good my going on like this.",
    "Youve got to take my\nword for it and start on the assumption that Jim is innocent.",
    "Do you think that somebody is deliberately trying to fasten the\ncrime on him asked Charles Enderby in his best journalistic\nmanner.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "You see nobody knew about Jim coming down to\nsee his Uncle.",
    "Of course one cant be certain but I should put that\ndown as just a coincidence and bad luck.",
    "What we have to find is\nsomeone else with a motive for killing Captain Trevelyan.",
    "The police\nare quite certain that this is not what they call an outside job  I\nmean it wasnt a burglar.",
    "The broken open window was faked.",
    "Did the police tell you all this\n\n\fPractically said Emily.",
    "What do you mean by practically\n\nThe chambermaid told me and her sister is married to Constable\nGraves so of course she knows everything the police think.",
    "Very well said Mr Enderby it wasnt an outside job.",
    "It was an\ninside one.",
    "Exactly said Emily.",
    "The police  that is Inspector Narracott who\nby the way I should think is an awfully sound man have started\ninvestigating to find who benefits by Captain Trevelyans death and\nwith Jim sticking out a mile so to speak they wont bother to go on\nwith other investigations much.",
    "Well thats got to be our job.",
    "What a scoop it would be said Mr Enderby if you and I\ndiscovered the real murderer.",
    "The crime expert of the Daily Wire thats the way I should be described.",
    "But its too good to be true\nhe added despondently.",
    "That sort of thing only happens in books.",
    "Nonsense said Emily it happens with me.",
    "Youre simply marvelous said Enderby again.",
    "Emily brought out a little notebook.",
    "Now lets put things down methodically.",
    "Jim himself his brother\nand sister and his Aunt Jennifer benefit equally by Captain\n\n\fTrevelyans death.",
    "Of course Sylvia  thats Jims sister  wouldnt\nhurt a fly but I wouldnt put it past her husband hes what I call a\nnasty sort of brute.",
    "You know  the artistic nasty kind has affairs\nwith women  all that sort of thing.",
    "Very likely to be in a hole\nfinancially  The money theyd come into would actually be Sylvias\nbut that wouldnt matter to him.",
    "He would soon manage to get it out\nof her.",
    "He sounds a most unpleasant person said Mr Enderby.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Goodlooking in a bold sort of way.",
    "Women talk about sex\nwith him in corners.",
    "Real men hate him.",
    "Well thats suspect No.",
    "1 said Mr Enderby also writing in a little\nbook.",
    "Investigate his movements on Friday  easily done under the\nguise of interview with popular novelist connected with the crime.",
    "Is that all right\n\nSplendid said Emily.",
    "Then theres Brian Jims younger brother.",
    "Hes supposed to be in Australia but he might quite easily have\ncome back.",
    "I mean people do sometimes without saying.",
    "We could send him a cable.",
    "We will.",
    "I suppose Aunt Jennifer is out of it.",
    "From all Ive heard\nshes rather a wonderful person.",
    "Shes got character.",
    "Still after all\nshe wasnt very far away she was only at Exeter.",
    "She might have\ncome over to see her brother and he might have said something\nnasty about her husband whom she adores and she might have\nseen red and snatched up a sandbag and biffed him one.",
    "Do yon really think so said Mr Enderby dubiously.",
    "No rot really.",
    "But one never knows.",
    "Then of course theres the\nbatman.",
    "He only gets 100 pounds under the will and he seems all\nright.",
    "But there again one never knows.",
    "His wife is Mrs Bellings\nniece.",
    "You know Mrs Belling who keeps the Three Crowns.",
    "I think I\nshall weep on her shoulder when I get back.",
    "She looks rather a\nmotherly and romantic soul.",
    "I think she would be terribly sorry for\nme with my young man probably going to prison and she might let\nslip something useful.",
    "And then of course theres Sittaford House.",
    "Do you know what struck me as queer\n\nNo what\n\nThese people the Willetts.",
    "The ones that took Captain Trevelyans\nhouse furnished in the middle of winter.",
    "Its an awfully queer thing\nto do.",
    "Yes it is odd agreed Mr Enderby.",
    "There might be something at\nthe bottom of that  something to do with Captain Trevelyans past\nlife.",
    "That s\u0439ance business was queer too he added.",
    "Im thinking of\nwriting that up for the paper.",

    "May be something in these things.",
    "First time Ive really ever\ncome across anything authentic.",
    "Emily gave a slight shiver.",
    "I hate supernatural things she said.",
    "Just for once as you say it does look as though there was\nsomething in it.",
    "But how  how gruesome\n\nThis s\u0439ance business never seems very practical does it If the\nold boy could get through and say he was dead why couldnt he say\nwho murdered him It ought to be all so simple.",
    "I feel there may be a clue in Sittaford said Emily thoughtfully.",
    "Yes I think we ought to investigate there thoroughly said\nEnderby.",

    "And he didnt do it and oh dear its all too dreadful\n\nAnd here Emily began to cry.",
    "She had earlier in the day\nannounced her intentions to Charles Enderby of doing so but what\nappalled her so was with what ease the tears came.",

    "Terribly shy poor dear.",
    "That was what was the matter with him.",
    "Ive known dozens of men\nlike it.",
    "They are called women haters and all sorts of silly things\nand really all the time its only shyness.",

    "She might be as innocent as\nshe appeared.",
    "On the other hand she might not.",
    "The point I am anxious to get information about is this he said\nand paused.",
    "Yes Inspector\n\nMajor Burnaby as you doubtless know discovered the body.",
    "He\nwas led to do so by an accident that occurred in this house.",
    "You mean\n\nI mean the table turning.",

    "Im saying what I thought at the time Violet.",
    "What could one think\nit but a joke\n\nIt was curious said the Inspector slowly.",

    "Up to then it had been oh just lighthearted fooling.",
    "You know the sort of thing.",
    "Good fun on a winters evening.",
    "And\nthen suddenly  this I was very angry.",
    "Angry\n\nWell naturally.",
    "I thought someone was doing it deliberately  for a\njoke as I say.",
    "And now\n\n\fNow\n\nYes what do you think now\n\nMrs Willett spread her hands out expressively.",

    "I shall never forget it.",
    "I dream of it.",
    "I shall never\ndare to do table turning again.",
    "Mr Rycroft would say it was genuine I suppose said her mother.",
    "He believes in all that sort of thing.",
    "Really Im inclined to believe in\nit myself.",
    "What other explanation is there except that it was a\ngenuine message from a spirit\n\nThe Inspector shook his head.",
    "The table turning had been his red\nherring.",
    "His next remark was most casual sounding.",
    "Dont you find it very bleak here in winter Mrs Willett\n\nOh we love it.",
    "Such a change.",

    "Well  we were reading these books as I told you and there was a\nboy on board who talked about Exhampton  he was so enthusiastic\nabout it.",
    "What was his name asked the Inspector.",
    "Did he come from this\npart of the world\n\nNow what was his name Cullen  I think.",
    "No  it was Smythe.",
    "How\nstupid of me.",
    "I really cant remember.",
    "You know how it is on board\nship Inspector you get to know people so well and plan to meet\nagain  and a week after youve landed you cant even be sure of\ntheir names\n\n\fShe laughed.",
    "But he was such a nice boy  not goodlooking reddish hair but a\ndelightful smile.",
    "And on the strength of that you decided to take a house in these\nparts said the Inspector smiling.",
    "Yes wasnt it mad of us\n\nClever thought Narracott.",
    "Distinctly clever.",
    "He began to realise\nMrs Willetts methods.",
    "She always carried the war into the enemys\ncountry.",
    "So you wrote to the house agents and inquired about a house\n\nYes  and they sent us particulars of Sittaford.",
    "It sounded just what\nwe wanted.",
    "It wouldnt be my taste at this time of year said the Inspector with\na laugh.",
    "I daresay it wouldnt be ours if we lived in England said Mrs\nWillett brightly.",
    "The Inspector rose.",
    "How did you know the name of a house agent to write to in\nExhampton he asked.",
    "That must have presented a difficulty.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "The first pause in the conversation.",
    "He thought\nhe caught a glimpse of vexation more of anger in Mrs Willetts\neyes.",
    "He had hit upon something to which she had not thought out\nthe answer.",
    "She turned towards her daughter.",
    "How did we Violet I cant remember.",
    "There was a different look in the girls eyes.",
    "She looked frightened.",
    "Why of course said Mrs Willett.",
    "Delfridges.",
    "Their information\nbureau.",
    "Its too wonderful.",
    "I always go and inquire there about\neverything.",
    "I asked them the name of the best agent here and they\ntold me.",
    "Quick thought the Inspector.",
    "Very quick.",
    "But not quite quick\nenough.",
    "I had you there madam.",
    "He made a cursory examination of the house.",
    "There was nothing\nthere.",
    "No papers no locked drawers or cupboards.",
    "Mrs Willett accompanied him talking brightly.",
    "He took his leave\nthanking her politely.",
    "As he departed he caught a glimpse of the girls face over her\nshoulder.",
    "There was no mistaking the expression on her face.",
    "It was fear he saw on her countenance.",
    "Fear written there plainly at\nthis moment when she thought herself unobserved.",
    "Mrs Willett was still talking.",
    "Alas.",
    "We have one grave drawback here.",
    "The domestic problem\nInspector.",
    "Servants will not stand these country places.",
    "All of mine\nhave been threatening to leave us for some time and the news of\nthe murder seems to have unsettled them utterly.",
    "I dont know what\nI shall do.",
    "Perhaps men servants would answer the case.",
    "That is\nwhat the Registry Office in Exeter advised.",
    "The Inspector answered mechanically.",
    "He was not listening to her\nflow of talk.",
    "He was thinking of the expression he had surprised on\nthe girls face.",
    "Mrs Willett had been clever  but not quite clever enough.",
    "He went away cogitating on his problem.",
    "If the Willetts had nothing to do with Captain Trevelyans death why\nwas Violet Willett afraid\n\nHe fired his last shot.",
    "With his foot actually over the threshold of the\nfront door he turned back.",
    "By the way he said you know young Pearson dont you\n\nThere was no doubt of the pause this time.",
    "A dead silence of about\na second.",
    "Then Mrs Willett spoke\n\nPearson she said.",
    "I dont think \n\n\fShe was interrupted.",
    "A queer sighing breath came from the room\nbehind her and then the sound of a fall.",
    "The Inspector was over the\nthreshold and into the room in a flash.",
    "Violet Willett had fainted.",
    "Poor child cried Mrs Willett.",
    "All this strain and shock.",
    "That\ndreadful table turning business and the murder on the top of it.",
    "She\nisnt strong.",
    "Thank you so much Inspector.",
    "Yes on the sofa please.",
    "If you would ring the bell.",
    "No I dont think there is anything more\nyou can do.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "The Inspector went down the drive with his lips set in a grim line.",
    "Jim Pearson was engaged he knew to that extremely charming\nlooking girl he had seen in London.",
    "Why then should Violet Willett faint at the mention of his name\nWhat was the connection between Jim Pearson and the Willetts\n\nHe paused indecisively as he emerged from the front gate.",
    "Then he\ntook from his pocket a small notebook.",
    "In it was entered a list of the\ninhabitants of the six bungalows built by Captain Trevelyan with a\nfew brief remarks against each name.",
    "Inspector Narracotts stubby\nforefinger paused at the entry against No.",
    "6 The Cottages.",
    "Yes he said to himself.",
    "Id better see him next.",
    "He strode briskly down the lane and beat a firm rattat on the\nknocker of No.",
    "6  the bungalow inhabited by Mr Duke.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nVISIT TO MAJOR BURNABY\n\nLeading the way up the path to the Majors front door Mr Enderby\nrapped upon it in a cheery fashion.",
    "The door was flung open almost\nimmediately and Major Burnaby red in the face appeared on the\nthreshold.",
    "Its you is it he observed with no very great fervor in his voice\nand was about to go on in the same strain when he caught sight of\nEmily and his expression altered.",
    "This is Miss Trefusis said Charles with the air of one producing\nthe ace of trumps.",
    "She was very anxious to see you.",
    "May I come in said Emily with her sweetest smile.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Certainly.",
    "Of course  Oh yes of course.",
    "Stumbling in his speech the Major backed into the livingroom of his\ncottage and began pulling forward chairs and pushing aside tables.",
    "Emily as was her fashion came straight to the point.",
    "You see\nMajor Burnaby I am engaged to Jim  Jim Pearson you know.",
    "And\nnaturally I am terribly anxious about him.",
    "In the act of pushing a table the Major paused with his mouth open.",
    "Oh dear he said thats a bad business.",
    "My dear young lady I am\nmore sorry about it than I can say.",
    "Major Burnaby tell me honestly.",
    "Do you yourself believe he is\nguilty Oh you neednt mind saying if you do.",
    "I would a hundred\ntimes rather people didnt lie to me.",
    "No I do not think him guilty said the Major in a loud assertive\nvoice.",
    "He hit a cushion once or twice vigorously and then sat down\nfacing Emily.",
    "The chap is a nice young chap.",
    "Mind you he might be\na bit weak.",
    "Dont be offended if I say that hes the kind of young\nfellow that might easily go wrong if temptation came in his way.",
    "But\nmurder  no.",
    "And mind you I know what I am talking about  a lot of\nsubalterns have passed through my hands in my time.",
    "Its the\nfashion to make fun at retired army officers nowadays but we know\na thing or two all the same Miss Trefusis.",
    "Im sure you do said Emily.",
    "Im awfully grateful to you for saying\nwhat youve done.",
    "Have  have a whisky and soda said the Major.",
    "Im afraid theres\nnothing else he said apologetically.",
    "No thank you Major Burnaby.",
    "Some plain soda then\n\nNo thank you said Emily.",
    "I ought to be able to produce tea said the Major with a touch of\nwistfulness.",
    "Weve had it said Charles.",
    "At Mrs Curtiss he added.",
    "Major Burnaby said Emily Who do you think did it have you any\nidea at all\n\nNo.",
    "I am damned  er  bother  if I have said the Major.",
    "Took it\nfor granted it was some chap that broke in but now the police say\nthat cant be so.",
    "Well its their job and I suppose they know best.",
    "They say nobody broke in so I suppose nobody did break in.",
    "But all\nthe same it beats me Miss Trefusis Trevelyan hadnt an enemy in\nthe world as far as I know.",
    "And you would know if anybody did said Emily.",
    "Yes I suppose I knew more of Trevelyan than many of his relations\ndid.",
    "And you cant think of anything  anything that would help in any\nway asked Emily.",
    "The Major pulled at his short mustache.",
    "I know what youre thinking.",
    "Like in books there ought to be some\nlittle incident that I should remember that would be a clue.",
    "Well Im\nsorry but there isnt any such thing.",
    "Trevelyan just led an ordinary\nnormal life.",
    "Got very few letters and wrote less.",
    "There were no\n\n\ffemale complications in his life I am sure of that.",
    "No it beats me\nMiss Trefusis.",
    "All three were silent.",
    "What about that servant of his asked Charles.",
    "Been with him for years.",
    "Absolutely faithful.",
    "He had married lately said Charles.",
    "Married a perfectly decent respectable girl.",
    "Major Burnaby said Emily forgive me putting it this way  but\ndidnt you get the wind up rather easily about him\n\nThe Major rubbed his nose with the embarrassed air that always\ncame over him when the table turning was mentioned.",
    "Yes theres no denying it I did.",
    "I knew the whole thing was tommy\nrot and yet \n\nYou felt somehow it wasnt said Emily helpfully.",
    "The Major nodded.",
    "Thats why I wonder  said Emily.",
    "The two men looked at her.",
    "I cant quite put what I mean in the way I want said Emily.",
    "What I\nmean is this You say that you dont believe in all this table turning\nbusiness  and yet in spite of the awful weather and what must\nhave seemed to you the absurdity of the whole thing  you felt so\nuneasy that you had to set out no matter what the weather\nconditions and see for yourself that Captain Trevelyan was all\nright.",
    "Well dont you think that may have been because  because\nthere was something in the atmosphere.",
    "I mean she continued desperately as she saw no trace of\ncomprehension in the Majors face that there was something in\nsomeone elses mind as well as yours.",
    "And that somehow or other\nyou felt it.",
    "Well I dont know said the Major.",
    "He rubbed his nose again.",
    "Of\ncourse he added hopefully women do take these things\nseriously.",
    "Women said Emily.",
    "Yes she murmured softly to herself I\nbelieve somehow or other thats it.",
    "She turned abruptly to Major Burnaby.",
    "What are they like these Willetts\n\nOh well Major Burnaby cast about in his mind he was clearly no\ngood at personal descriptions Well  they are very kind you know very helpful and all that.",
    "Why do they want to take a house like Sittaford House at this time\nof year\n\nI cant imagine said the Major.",
    "Nobody does he added.",
    "Dont you think its very queer persisted Emily.",
    "Of course its queer.",
    "However theres no accounting for tastes.",
    "Thats what the Inspector said.",
    "Thats nonsense said Emily.",
    "People dont do things without a\nreason.",
    "Well I dont know said Major Burnaby cautiously.",
    "Some people\ndont.",
    "You wouldnt Miss Trefusis.",
    "But some people  He sighed\nand shook his head.",
    "You are sure they hadnt met Captain Trevelyan before\n\nThe Major scouted the idea.",
    "Trevelyan would have said something\nto him.",
    "No he was as astonished himself as anyone could be.",
    "So he thought it queer\n\nOf course Ive just told you we all did.",
    "What was Mrs Willetts attitude towards Captain Trevelyan\nasked Emily.",
    "Did she try and avoid him\n\nA faint chuckle came from the Major.",
    "No indeed she didnt.",
    "Pestered the life out of him  always asking\nhim to come and see them.",
    "Oh said Emily thoughtfully.",
    "She paused and then said So she\nmight  just possibly she might have taken Sittaford House just on\npurpose to get acquainted with Captain Trevelyan.",
    "Well the Major seemed to turn it over in his mind.",
    "Yes I suppose\nshe might have.",
    "Rather an expensive way of doing things.",
    "I dont know said Emily.",
    "Captain Trevelyan wouldnt have been\nan easy person to get to know otherwise.",
    "No he wouldnt agreed the late Captain Trevelyans friend.",
    "I wonder said Emily.",
    "The Inspector thought of that too said Burnaby.",
    "Emily\n\nfelt a\n\nsudden\n\nirritation\n\nagainst\n\nInspector\n\nNarracott.",
    "Everything that she thought of seemed to have already been\nthought of by the Inspector.",
    "It was galling to a young woman who\nprided herself on being sharper than other people.",
    "She rose and held out her hand.",
    "Thank you very much she said simply.",
    "I wish I could help you more said the Major.",
    "Im rather an\nobvious sort of person  always have been.",
    "If I were a clever chap I\nmight be able to hit upon something that might be a clue.",
    "At any\nrate count on me for anything you want.",
    "Thank you said Emily.",
    "I will.",
    "Goodby sir said Enderby.",
    "I shall be along in the morning with\nmy camera you know.",
    "Burnaby grunted.",
    "Emily and Charles retraced their steps to Mrs Curtiss.",
    "Come into my room I want to talk to you said Emily.",
    "She sat on the one chair and Charles sat on the bed.",
    "Emily plucked off her hat and sent it spinning into a corner of the\nroom.",
    "Now listen she said.",
    "I think Ive got a kind of starting point.",
    "I\nmay be wrong and I may be right at any rate its an idea.",
    "I think a lot\nhinges on this table turning business.",
    "Youve done table turning\nhavent you\n\nOh yes now and then.",
    "Not serious you know.",
    "No of course not.",
    "Its the kind of thing one does on a wet\nafternoon and everyone accuses everyone else of shoving.",
    "Well if\n\n\fyouve played it you know what happens.",
    "The table starts spelling\nout say a name well its a name somebody knows.",
    "Very often they\nrecognize it at once and hope it isnt going to be that and all the\ntime unconsciously they are what one calls shoving.",
    "I mean sort of\nrecognizing things makes one give an involuntary jerk when the\nnext letter comes and stops the thing.",
    "And the less you want to do\nthat sometimes the more it happens.",
    "Yes thats true agreed Mr Enderby.",
    "I dont believe for a moment in spirits or anything like that.",
    "But\nsupposing that one of those people who were playing knew that\nCaptain Trevelyan was being murdered at that minute \n\nOh I say protested Charles thats awfully farfetched.",
    "Well it neednt be quite so crude as that.",
    "Yes I think it must be.",
    "We\nare just taking a hypothesis  thats all.",
    "We are asserting that\nsomebody knew that Captain Trevelyan was dead and absolutely\ncouldnt hide their knowledge.",
    "The table betrayed them.",
    "Its awfully ingenious said Charles but I dont believe for a\nminute its true.",
    "Well assume that it is true said Emily firmly.",
    "I am sure that in\ndetection of crime you mustnt be afraid to assume things.",
    "Oh Im quite agreeable said Mr Enderby.",
    "Well assume that it is\ntrue  anything you like.",
    "So what we have to do said Emily is to consider very carefully\nthe people who were playing.",
    "To begin with theres Major Burnaby\nand Mr Rycroft.",
    "Well it seems wildly unlikely that either of them\nshould have an accomplice who was the murderer.",
    "Then there is\nthis Mr Duke.",
    "Well for the moment we know nothing about him.",
    "He\nhas only just arrived here lately and of course he might be a\nsinister stranger  part of a gang or something.",
    "We will put X against\nhis name.",
    "And now we come to the Willetts.",
    "Charles there is\nsomething awfully mysterious about the Willetts.",
    "What on earth have they got to gain from Captain Trevelyans\ndeath\n\nWell on the face of it nothing.",
    "But if my theory is correct there\nmust be a connection somewhere.",
    "Weve got to find what is the\nconnection.",
    "Right said Mr Enderby.",
    "And supposing its all a mares nest\n\nWell well have to start all over again said Emily.",
    "Hark cried Charles suddenly.",
    "He held up his hand.",
    "Then he went over to the window and opened\nit and Emily too heard the sound which had aroused his attention.",
    "It was the far off booming of a great bell.",
    "As they stood listening Mrs Curtiss voice called excitedly from\nbelow.",
    "Do you hear the bell Miss  do you hear it\n\nEmily opened the door.",
    "Dyou hear it Plain as plain isnt it Well now to think of that\n\nWhat is it asked Emily.",
    "Its the bell at Princetown Miss near to twelve miles away.",
    "It\nmeans that a convicts escaped.",
    "George George where is that\nman Dyou hear the bell Theres a convict loose.",
    "Her voice died away as she went through the kitchen.",
    "Charles shut the window and sat down on the bed again.",
    "Its a pity that things happen all wrong he said dispassionately.",
    "If only this convict had escaped on Friday why there would be our\nmurderer nicely accounted for.",
    "No farther to look.",
    "Hungry man\ndesperate criminal breaks in.",
    "Trevelyan defends his Englishmans\ncastle  and desperate criminal biffs him one.",
    "All so simple.",
    "It would have been said Emily with a sigh.",
    "Instead of which said Charles he escapes three days too late.",
    "Its  its hopelessly inartistic.",
    "He shook his head sadly.",
    "Chapter 16\n\nMR RYCROFT\n\nEmily woke early the next morning.",
    "Being a sensible young woman\nshe\n\nrealized\n\nthere\n\nwas\n\nlittle\n\npossibility\n\nof\n\nMr\n\nEnderbys\n\ncollaboration until the morning was well advanced.",
    "So feeling\nrestless and unable to lie still she set out for a brisk walk along the\nlane in the opposite direction from which they had come last night.",
    "She passed the gates of Sittaford House on her right and shortly\nafter that the lane took a sharp turn to the right and ran steeply up\nhill and came out on the open moor where it degenerated into a\ngrass track and soon petered out altogether.",
    "The morning was a\nfine one cold and crisp and the view was lovely.",
    "Emily ascended to\nthe very top of Sittaford Tor a pile of gray rock of a fantastic shape.",
    "From this height she looked down over an expanse of moorland\nunbroken as far as she could see without any habitation or any\nroad.",
    "Below her on the opposite side of the Tor were gray masses\nof granite boulders and rocks.",
    "After considering the scene for a\nminute or two she turned to view the prospect to the north from\nwhich she had come.",
    "Just below her lay Sittaford clustering on the\nflank of the hill the square gray blob of Sittaford House and the\ndotted cottages beyond it.",
    "In the valley below she could see\nExhampton.",
    "One ought thought Emily confusedly to see things better when\nyou are high up like this.",
    "It ought to be like lifting off the top of a\ndolls house and peering in.",
    "She wished with all her heart that she had met the dead man even if\nonly once.",
    "It was so hard to get an idea of people you had never\nseen.",
    "You had to rely on other peoples judgment and Emily had\nnever yet acknowledged that any other persons judgment was\nsuperior to her own.",
    "Other peoples impressions were no good to\nyou.",
    "They might be just as true as yours but you couldnt act on\nthem.",
    "You couldnt as it were use another persons angle of attack.",
    "Meditating vexedly on these questions Emily sighed impatiently\nand shifted her position.",
    "She had been so lost in her own thoughts that she had been\noblivious to her immediate surroundings.",
    "It was with a shock of\nsurprise that she realized that a small elderly gentleman was\nstanding a few feet away from her his hat held courteously in his\nhand while he breathed rather fast.",
    "Excuse me he said.",
    "Miss Trefusis I believe\n\nYes said Emily.",
    "My name is Rycroft.",
    "You must forgive me speaking to you but in\nthis little community of ours the smallest detail is known and your\narrival here yesterday has naturally gone the round.",
    "I can assure\nyou that everyone feels a deep sympathy with your position Miss\nTrefusis.",
    "We are all one and all anxious to assist you in any way we\ncan.",
    "Thats very kind of you said Emily.",
    "Not at all not at all said Mr Rycroft.",
    "Beauty in distress you will\npardon my oldfashioned manner of putting it.",
    "But seriously my\ndear young lady do count on me if there is any way in which I can\npossibly assist you.",
    "Beautiful view from up here is it not\n\nWonderful agreed Emily.",
    "The moor is a wonderful place.",
    "You know that a prisoner must have escaped last night from\nPrincetown.",
    "Yes.",
    "Has he been recaptured\n\nNot yet I believe.",
    "Ah well poor fellow he will no doubt be\nrecaptured soon enough.",
    "I believe I am right in saying that no one\nhas escaped successfully from Princetown for the last twenty\nyears.",
    "Which direction is Princetown\n\nMr Rycroft stretched out his arm and pointed southwards over the\nmoor.",
    "It lies over there about twelve miles as the crow flies over\nunbroken moorland.",
    "Its sixteen miles by road.",
    "Emily gave a faint shiver.",
    "The idea of the desperate hunted man\nimpressed her powerfully.",
    "Mr Rycroft was watching her and gave a\nlittle nod.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "I feel the same myself.",
    "Its curious how ones\ninstincts rebel at the thought of a man being hunted down and yet\nthese men at Princetown are all dangerous and violent criminals\nthe kind of men whom probably you and I would do our utmost to\nput there in the first place.",
    "He gave a little apologetic laugh.",
    "You must forgive me Miss Trefusis I am deeply interested in the\nstudy of crime.",
    "A fascinating study.",
    "Ornithology and criminology\nare my two subjects.",
    "He paused and then went on\n\nThats the reason why if you will allow me to do so I should like to\nassociate myself with you in this matter.",
    "To study a crime at first\nhand has long been an unrealized dream of mine.",
    "Will you place\nyour confidence in me Miss Trefusis and allow me to place my\nexperience at your disposal I have read and studied this subject\ndeeply.",
    "Emily was silent for a minute.",
    "She was congratulating herself on the\nway events were playing into her hand.",
    "Here was firsthand\nknowledge being offered her of life as it had been lived at Sittaford.",
    "Angle of attack Emily repeated the phrase that had crept into her\nmind so short a time before.",
    "She had had Major Burnabys angle matter of fact  simple  direct.",
    "Taking cognizance of facts and\ncompletely oblivious of subtleties.",
    "Now she was being offered\nanother angle which she suspected might open up a very different\nfield of vision.",
    "This little shriveled driedup gentleman had read\nand studied deeply was well versed in human nature had that\n\n\fdevouring interested curiosity in life displayed by the man of\nreflection as opposed to the man of action.",
    "Please help me she said simply.",
    "I am so very worried and\nunhappy.",
    "You must be my dear you must be.",
    "Now as I understand the\nposition Trevelyans eldest nephew has been arrested or detained\n the evidence against him being of a somewhat simple and obvious\nnature I of course have an open mind.",
    "You must allow me that.",
    "Of course said Emily.",
    "Why should you believe in his innocence\nwhen you know nothing about him\n\nMost reasonable said Mr Rycroft.",
    "Really Miss Trefusis you\nyourself are a most interesting study.",
    "By the way your name  is it\nCornish like our poor friend Trevelyan\n\nYes said Emily.",
    "My father was Cornish my mother was\nScottish.",
    "Ah said Mr Rycroft very interesting.",
    "Now to approach our little\nproblem.",
    "On the one hand we assume that young Jim  the name is\nJim is it not We assume that young Jim had a pressing need of\nmoney that he came down to see his uncle that he asked for\nmoney that his uncle refused that in a moment of passion he\npicked up a sandbag that was lying at the door and that he hit his\nuncle over the head.",
    "The crime was unpremeditated  was in fact a\nfoolish irrational affair most deplorably conducted.",
    "Now all that\nmay be so on the other hand he may have parted with his uncle in\n\n\fanger and some other person may have stepped in shortly\nafterwards and committed the crime.",
    "That is what you believe  and\nto put it a little differently that is what I hope.",
    "I do not want your\nfianc\u0439e to have committed the crime for from my point of view it is\nso uninteresting that he should have done so.",
    "I am therefore\nbacking the other horse.",
    "The crime was committed by someone\nelse.",
    "We will assume that and go at once to a most important point.",
    "Was that someone else aware of the quarrel that had just taken\nplace Did that quarrel in fact actually precipitate the murder You\nsee my point Someone is meditating doing away with Captain\nTrevelyan and seizes this opportunity realizing that suspicion is\nbound to fall on young Jim.",
    "Emily considered the matter from this angle.",
    "In that case she said slowly \n\nMr Rycroft took the words out of her mouth.",
    "In that case he said briskly the murderer would have to be a\nperson in close association with Captain Trevelyan.",
    "He would have\nto be domiciled in Exhampton.",
    "In all probability he would have to be\nin the house either during or after the quarrel.",
    "And since we are\nnot in a court of law and can bandy about names freely the name of\nthe servant Evans leaps to our minds as a person who could\nsatisfy our conditions.",
    "A man who quite possibly might have been in\nthe house.",
    "Have overheard the quarrel and seized the opportunity.",
    "Our next point is to discover whether Evans benefits in any way\nfrom his masters death.",
    "I believe he gets a small legacy said Emily.",
    "That may or may not constitute a sufficient motive.",
    "We shall have\nto discover whether or not Evans had a pressing need of money.",
    "We must also consider Mrs Evans  there is a Mrs Evans of recent\ndate I understand.",
    "If you had studied criminology Miss Trefusis\nyou would realize the curious effect caused by inbreeding\nespecially in country districts.",
    "There are at least four young women\nin Broadmoor pleasant in manner but with that curious kink in\ntheir dispositions that human life is of little or no account to them.",
    "No  we must not leave Mrs Evans out of account.",
    "What do you think about this table turning business Mr Rycroft\n\nNow that is very strange.",
    "Most strange.",
    "I confess Miss Trefusis\nthat I am powerfully impressed by it.",
    "I am as perhaps you may have\nheard a believer in psychic things.",
    "To a certain degree I am a\nbeliever in spiritualism.",
    "I have already written out a full account and\nsent it up to the Society of Psychical Research.",
    "A well\nauthenticated and amazing case.",
    "Five people present none of\nwhom could have the least idea or suspicion that Captain Trevelyan\nwas murdered.",
    "You dont think \n\nEmily stopped.",
    "It was not so easy to suggest her own idea to Mr\nRycroft that one of the five people might have guilty foreknowledge\nas he himself had been one of them.",
    "Not that she suspected for a\nmoment that there was anything whatever to connect Mr Rycroft\nwith the tragedy.",
    "Still she felt that the suggestion might not be\n\n\fwholly tactful.",
    "She pursued her object in a more roundabout\nmanner.",
    "It all interested me very much Mr Rycroft it is as you say an\namazing occurrence.",
    "You dont think that any of the people present\nwith the exception of yourself of course were in any way psychic\n\nMy dear young lady I myself am not psychic.",
    "I have no powers in\nthat direction.",
    "I am only a very deeply interested observer.",
    "What about this Mr Garfield\n\nA nice lad said Mr Rycroft but not remarkable in any way.",
    "Well off I suppose said Emily.",
    "Stony broke I believe said Mr Rycroft.",
    "I hope I am using that\nidiom correctly.",
    "He comes down here to dance attendance on an\naunt from whom he has what I call expectations.",
    "Miss Percehouse\nis a very sharp lady and I think she knows what these attentions are\nworth.",
    "But as she has a sardonic form of humor of her own she\nkeeps him dancing.",
    "I should like to meet her said Emily.",
    "Yes you must certainly meet her.",
    "She will no doubt insist on\nmeeting you.",
    "Curiosity  alas my dear Miss Trefusis  curiosity.",
    "Tell me about the Willetts said Emily.",
    "Charming said Mr Rycroft quite charming.",
    "Colonial of course.",
    "No real poise if you understand me.",
    "A little too lavish in their\nhospitality.",
    "Everything a shade on the ornate side.",
    "Miss Violet is a\ncharming girl.",
    "A funny place to come for the winter said Emily.",
    "Yes very odd is it not But after all it is only logical.",
    "We ourselves\nliving in this country long for the sunshine hot climates waving\npalm trees.",
    "People who live in Australia or South Africa are\nenchanted with the idea of an oldfashioned Christmas with snow\nand ice.",
    "I wonder which of them said Emily to herself told him that.",
    "She reflected that it was not necessary to bury yourself in a\nmoorland village in order to obtain an oldfashioned Christmas with\nsnow and ice.",
    "Clearly Mr Rycroft did not see anything suspicious in\nthe Willetts choice of a winter resort.",
    "But that she reflected was\nperhaps natural\n\nin one\n\nwho\n\nwas\n\nan ornithologist\n\nand\n\na\n\ncriminologist.",
    "Sittaford clearly appeared an ideal residence to Mr\nRycroft and he could not conceive of it as an unsuitable\nenvironment to someone else.",
    "They had been slowly descending the slope of the hillside and were\nnow wending their way down the lane.",
    "Who lives in that cottage asked Emily abruptly.",
    "Captain Wyatt  he is an invalid.",
    "Rather unsociable I fear.",
    "Was he a friend of Captain Trevelyans\n\nNot an intimate friend in any way.",
    "Trevelyan merely made a formal\nvisit to him every now and then.",
    "As a matter of fact Wyatt doesnt\nencourage visitors.",
    "A surly man.",
    "Emily was silent.",
    "She was reviewing the possibility of how she\nherself might become a visitor.",
    "She had no intention of allowing any\nangle of attack to remain unexplored.",
    "She suddenly remembered the hitherto unmentioned member of the\ns\u0439ance.",
    "What about Mr Duke she asked brightly.",
    "What about him\n\nWell who is he\n\nWell said Mr Rycroft slowly that is what nobody knows.",
    "How extraordinary said Emily.",
    "As a matter of fact said Mr Rycroft it isnt.",
    "You see Duke is\nsuch an entirely unmysterious individual.",
    "I should imagine that the\nonly mystery about him was his social origin.",
    "Not  not quite if you\nunderstand me.",
    "But a very solid good fellow he hastened to add.",
    "Emily was silent.",
    "This is my cottage said Mr Rycroft pausing perhaps you will do\nme the honor of coming in and inspecting it.",
    "I should love to said Emily.",
    "They went up the small path and entered the cottage.",
    "The interior\nwas charming.",
    "Bookcases lined the walls.",
    "Emily went from one to the other glancing curiously at the titles of\nthe books.",
    "One section dealt with occult phenomena another with\nmodern detective fiction but by far the greater part of the\nbookcases was given up to criminology and to the worlds famous\ntrials.",
    "Books on ornithology held a comparatively small position.",
    "I think its all delightful said Emily.",
    "I must get back now.",
    "I expect\nMr Enderby will be up and waiting for me.",
    "As a matter of fact I\nhavent had breakfast yet.",
    "We told Mrs Curtis half past nine and I\nsee its ten oclock.",
    "I shall be dreadfully late  thats because youve\nbeen so interesting  and so very helpful.",
    "Anything I can do burbled Mr Rycroft as Emily turned a\nbewitching glance on him.",
    "You can count on me.",
    "We are\ncollaborators.",
    "Emily gave him her hand and squeezed his warmly.",
    "Its so wonderful she said using the phrase that in the course of\nher short life she had found so effectual to feel that theres\nsomeone on whom one can really rely.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nMISS PERCEHOUSE\n\nEmily returned to find eggs and bacon and Charles waiting for her.",
    "Mrs Curtis was still agog with excitement over the escape of the\nconvict.",
    "Two years it is since the last one escaped she said and three\ndays it was before they found him.",
    "Near to Moretonhampstead he\nwas.",
    "Do you think hell come this way asked Charles.",
    "Local\nknowledge vetoed this suggestion.",
    "They never comes this way all bare moorland it is and only small\ntowns when you do come off the moor.",
    "Hell make for Plymouth\nthats the most likely.",
    "But theyll catch him long before that.",
    "You could find a good hiding place among these rocks on the other\nside of the Tor said Emily.",
    "Youre right Miss and there is a hiding place there the Pixies\nCave they call it.",
    "As narrow an opening between two rocks as you\ncould find but it widens out inside.",
    "They say one of King Charless\n\n\fmen hid there once for a fortnight with a serving maid from a farm\nbringing him food.",
    "I must take a look at that Pixies Cave said Charles.",
    "Youll be surprised how hard it is to find sir.",
    "Many a picnic party in\nsummer looks for it the whole afternoon and doesnt find it but if\nyou do find it be sure you leave a pin inside it for luck.",
    "I wonder said Charles when breakfast was over and he and Emily\nhad strolled out into the small bit of garden if I ought to go off to\nPrincetown Amazing how things pile up once you have a bit of\nluck.",
    "Here I am  I start with a simple football competition prize and\nbefore I know where I am I run straight into an escaped convict and\na murderer.",
    "Marvelous\n\nWhat about this photographing of Major Burnabys cottage\n\nCharles looked up at the sky.",
    "Hm he said.",
    "I think I shall say the weather is wrong.",
    "I have got\nto hang on to my raison d\u043atre of being in Sittaford as long as\npossible and its coming over misty.",
    "Er  I hope you dont mind I\nhave just posted off an interview with you\n\nOh thats all right said Emily mechanically.",
    "What have you made\nme say\n\nOh the usual sort of things people like to hear said Mr Enderby.",
    "Our special representative records his interview with Miss Emily\n\n\fTrefusis the fianc\u0439e of Mr James Pearson who has been arrested\nby the police and charged with the murder of Captain Trevelyan Then my impression of you as a highspirited beautiful girl.",
    "Thank you said Emily.",
    "Shingled went on Charles.",
    "What do you mean by shingled\n\nYou are said Charles.",
    "Well of course I am said Emily.",
    "But why mention it\n\nWomen readers always like to know said Charles Enderby.",
    "It\nwas a splendid interview.",
    "Youve no idea what fine womanly\ntouching things you said about standing by your man no matter if\nthe whole world was against him.",
    "Did I really say that said Emily wincing slightly.",
    "Do you mind said Mr Enderby anxiously.",
    "Oh no said Emily.",
    "Enjoy yourself darling.",
    "Mr Enderby looked\nslightly taken aback.",
    "Its all right said Emily.",
    "Thats a quotation.",
    "I had it on my bib\nwhen I was small  my Sunday bib.",
    "The weekday one had Dont be a\nglutton on it.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "I put in a very good bit about Captain Trevelyans sea\ncareer and just a hint at foreign idols looted and a possibility of a\nstrange priests revenge  only a hint you know.",
    "Well you seem to have done your days good deed said Emily.",
    "What have you been up to You were up early enough heaven\nknows.",
    "Emily described her meeting with Mr Rycroft.",
    "She broke off suddenly and Enderby glancing over his shoulders\nand following the direction of her eyes became aware of a pink\nhealthy looking young man leaning over the gate and making\nvarious apologetic noises to attract attention.",
    "I say said the young man frightfully sorry to butt in and all that.",
    "I\nmean it is awfully awkward but my aunt sent me along.",
    "Emily and Charles both said Oh in an inquiring tone not being\nmuch the wiser for the explanation.",
    "Yes said the young man.",
    "To tell the truth my aunts rather a\nTartar.",
    "What she says goes if you know what I mean.",
    "Of course I\nthink its frightfully bad form coming along at a time like this but if\nyou knew my aunt  and if you do as she wants you will know her in\na few minutes \n\nIs your aunt Miss Percehouse broke in Emily.",
    "Thats right said the young man much relieved.",
    "So you know all\nabout her Old Mother Curtis has been talking I suppose.",
    "She can\nwag a tongue cant she Not that shes a bad sort mind you.",
    "Well\nthe fact is my aunt said she wanted to see you and I was to come\nalong and tell you so.",
    "Compliments and all that and would it be\ntroubling you too much  she was an invalid and quite unable to get\nout and it would be a great kindness  well you know the sort of\nthing.",
    "I neednt say it all.",
    "Its curiosity really of course and if you\nsay youve got a headache or have got letters to write it will be\nquite all right and you neednt bother.",
    "Oh but I should like to bother said Emily.",
    "Ill come with you at\nonce.",
    "Mr Enderby has got to go along and see Major Burnaby.",
    "Have I said Enderby in a low voice.",
    "You have said Emily firmly.",
    "She dismissed him with a brief nod and joined her new friend in the\nroad.",
    "I suppose youre Mr Garfield she said.",
    "Thats right.",
    "I ought to have told you.",
    "Oh well said Emily it wasnt very difficult to guess.",
    "Splendid of you coming along like this said Mr Garfield.",
    "Lots of\ngirls would have been awfully offended.",
    "But you know what old\nladies are.",
    "You dont live down here do you Mr Garfield\n\nYou bet your life I dont said Ronnie Garfield with fervor.",
    "Did you\never see such a godforsaken spot Not so much as the Pictures to\ngo to.",
    "I wonder someone doesnt commit a murder to \n\nHe paused appalled by what he had said.",
    "I say I am sorry.",
    "I am the most unlucky devil that ever lived.",
    "Always coming out with the wrong thing.",
    "I never meant it for a\nmoment.",
    "Im sure you didnt said Emily soothingly.",
    "Here we are said Mr Garfield.",
    "He pushed open a gate and Emily\npassed through and went up the path leading to a small cottage\nidentical with the rest.",
    "In the livingroom giving on the garden was a\ncouch and on it was lying an elderly lady with a thin wrinkled face\nand with one of the sharpest and most interrogative noses that\nEmily had ever seen.",
    "She raised herself on an elbow with a little\ndifficulty.",
    "So youve brought her she said.",
    "Very kind of you my dear to\ncome along to see an old woman.",
    "But you know what it is when you\nare an invalid.",
    "You must have a finger in every pie going and if you\ncant go to the pie then the pie has got to come to you.",
    "And you\nneednt think its all curiosity  its more than that.",
    "Ronnie go out\nand paint the garden furniture.",
    "In the shed at the end of the garden.",
    "Two basket chairs and a bench.",
    "Youll find the paint there all\nready.",
    "Right oh Aunt Caroline.",
    "The obedient nephew disappeared.",
    "Sit down said Miss Percehouse.",
    "Emily sat on the chair indicated.",
    "Strange to say she had\nimmediately felt conscious of a distinct liking and sympathy for this\nrather sharptongued middleaged invalid.",
    "She felt indeed a kind of\nkinship with her.",
    "Here is someone thought Emily who goes straight to the point\nand means to have her own way and bosses everybody she can.",
    "Just like me only I happen to be rather goodlooking and she has to\ndo it all by force of character.",
    "I understand you are the girl who is engaged to Trevelyans\nnephew said Miss Percehouse.",
    "Ive heard all about you and now I\nhave seen you I understand exactly what you are up to.",
    "And I wish\nyou good luck.",
    "Thank you said Emily.",
    "I hate a slobbering female said Miss Percehouse.",
    "I like one who\ngets up and does things.",
    "She looked at Emily sharply.",
    "I suppose you pity me  lying here never able to get up and walk\nabout\n\nNo said Emily thoughtfully.",
    "I dont know that I do.",
    "I suppose that\none can if one has the determination always get something out of\nlife.",
    "If you cant get it in one way you get it in another.",
    "Quite right said Miss Percehouse.",
    "Youve got to take life from a\ndifferent angle thats all.",
    "Angle of attack murmured Emily.",
    "Whats that you say\n\nAs clearly as she was able Emily outlined the theory that she had\nevolved that morning and the application of it she had made to the\nmatter in hand.",
    "Not bad said Miss Percehouse nodding her head.",
    "Now my dear  we will get down to business.",
    "Not being a born fool\nI suppose youve come up to this village to find out what you can\nabout the people here and to see if what you find out has any\nbearing on the murder.",
    "Well if theres anything you want to know\nabout the people here I can tell it to you.",
    "Emily wasted no time.",
    "Concise and businesslike she came to the\npoint.",
    "Major Burnaby she asked.",
    "Typical retired army officer narrowminded in outlook jealous\ndisposition Credulous in money matters.",
    "Kind of man who invests in\na South Sea because he cant see a yard in front of his own nose.",
    "Likes to pay his debts promptly and dislikes people who dont wipe\ntheir feet on the mat.",
    "Mr Rycroft said Emily.",
    "Queer little man enormous egoist.",
    "Cranky.",
    "Likes to think himself a\nwonderful fellow.",
    "I suppose he has offered to help you solve the\ncase aright owing to his wonderful knowledge of criminology.",
    "Emily admitted that that was the case.",
    "Mr Duke she asked.",
    "Dont know a thing about the man  and yet I ought to.",
    "Most\nordinary type.",
    "I ought to know  and yet I dont.",
    "Its queer.",
    "Its like a\nname on the tip of your tongue and yet for the life of you you cant\nremember it.",
    "The Willetts asked Emily.",
    "Ah the Willetts Miss Percehouse hoisted herself up on an elbow\nagain in some excitement.",
    "What about the Willetts indeed Now Ill\ntell you something about them my dear.",
    "It may be useful to you or\nit may not.",
    "Go over to my writing table there and pull out the little\n\n\ftop drawer  the one to the left  thats right.",
    "Bring me the blank\nenvelope thats there.",
    "Emily brought the envelope as directed.",
    "I dont say its important  it probably isnt said Miss Percehouse.",
    "Everybody tells lies one way or another and Mrs Willett is perfectly\nentitled to do the same as everybody else.",
    "She took the envelope and slipped her hand inside.",
    "I will tell you all about it.",
    "When the Willetts arrived here with their\nsmart clothes and their maids and their innovation trunks she and\nViolet came up in Forders car and the maids and the innovation\ntrunks came by the station bus.",
    "And naturally the whole thing\nbeing an event as you might say I was looking out as they passed\nand I saw a colored label blow off from one of the trunks and dive\ndown on to one of my borders.",
    "Now if there is one thing I hate more\nthan another it is a litter of paper or mess of any kind so I sent\nRonnie out to pick it up and I was going to throw it away when it\nstruck me it was a bright pretty thing and I might as well keep it for\nthe scrapbooks I make for the childrens hospital.",
    "Well I wouldnt\nhave thought about it again except for Mrs Willett deliberately\nmentioning on two or three occasions that Violet had never been\nout of South Africa and that she herself had only been to South\nAfrica England and the Riviera.",
    "Yes said Emily.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Now  look at this.",
    "Miss Percehouse thrust a luggage label into Emilys hand.",
    "It bore\nthe inscription Mendles Hotel Melbourne.",
    "Australia said Miss Percehouse isnt South Africa  or it wasnt\nin my young days.",
    "I daresay it isnt important but there it is for what\nit is worth.",
    "And Ill tell you another thing I have heard Mrs Willett\ncalling to her daughter and she called Cooee and that again is\nmore typical of Australia than South Africa.",
    "And what I say is it is\nqueer.",
    "Why shouldnt you wish to admit that you come from\nAustralia if you do\n\nIts certainly curious said Emily.",
    "And its curious that they\nshould come to live here in winter time as they have.",
    "That leaps to the eye said Miss Percehouse.",
    "Have you met them\nyet\n\nNo.",
    "I thought of going there this morning.",
    "Only I didnt know quite\nwhat to say.",
    "Ill provide you with an excuse said Miss Percehouse briskly.",
    "Fetch me my fountain pen and some notepaper and an envelope.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Now let me see.",
    "She paused deliberately then\nwithout the least warning raised her voice in a hideous scream.",
    "Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie Is the boy deaf Why cant he come when\nhes called Ronnie Ronnie\n\nRonnie arrived at a brisk trot paint brush in hand.",
    "Is there anything the matter Aunt Caroline\n\nWhat should be the matter I was calling you that was all.",
    "Did you\nhave any particular cake for tea when you were at the Willetts\nyesterday\n\nCake\n\nCake sandwiches  anything.",
    "How slow you are boy.",
    "What did you\nhave to eat for tea\n\nThere was a coffee cake said Ronnie very much puzzled and\nsome sandwiches \n\nCoffee cake said Miss Percehouse.",
    "Thatll do.",
    "She began to\nwrite briskly.",
    "You can go back to your painting Ronnie.",
    "Dont hang\nabout and dont stand there with your mouth open.",
    "You had your\nadenoids out when you were eight years old so there is no excuse\nfor it.",
    "She continued to write\n\nDear Mrs Willett\n\nI hear you had the most delicious coffee cake for tea yesterday\nafternoon.",
    "Will you be so very kind as to give me the recipe for it.",
    "I\nknow youll not mind my asking you this  an invalid has so little\n\n\fvariety except in her diet.",
    "Miss Trefusis has kindly promised to take\nthis note for me as Ronnie is busy this morning.",
    "Is not this news\nabout the convict too dreadful\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nCaroline Percehouse.",
    "She put it in an envelope sealed it down and addressed it.",
    "There you are young woman.",
    "You will probably find the doorstep\nlittered with reporters.",
    "A lot of them passed along the lane in\nForders charabanc.",
    "I saw them.",
    "But you ask for Mrs Willett and say\nyou have brought a note from me and youll sail in.",
    "I neednt tell you\nto keep your eyes open and make the most you can of your visit.",
    "You will do that anyway.",
    "You are kind said Emily.",
    "You really are.",
    "I help those who can help themselves said Miss Percehouse.",
    "By\nthe way you havent asked me what I think of Ronnie yet.",
    "I presume\nhe is on your list of the village.",
    "He is a good lad in his way but\npitifully weak.",
    "I am sorry to say he would do almost anything for\nmoney.",
    "Look at what he stands from me And he hasnt got the\nbrains to see that I would like him just ten times better if he stood\nup to me now and again and told me to go to the devil.",
    "The only other person in the village is Captain Wyatt.",
    "He smokes\nopium I believe.",
    "And hes easily the worsttempered man in\nEngland.",
    "Anything more you want to know\n\nI dont think so said Emily.",
    "What you have told me seems pretty\ncomprehensive.",
    "Chapter 18\n\nEMILY VISITS SITTAFORD HOUSE\n\nAs Emily walked briskly along the lane she noticed once more how\nthe character of the morning was changing.",
    "The mist was closing\nup and round.",
    "What an awful place to live in England is thought Emily.",
    "If it isnt\nsnowing or raining or blowing its misty.",
    "And if the sun does shine\nits so cold that you cant feel your fingers or toes.",
    "She was interrupted in these reflections by a rather hoarse voice\nspeaking rather close to her right ear.",
    "Excuse me it said but do you happen to have seen a bull\nterrier\n\nEmily started and turned.",
    "Leaning over a gate was a tall thin man\nwith a very brown complexion bloodshot eyes and gray hair.",
    "He\nwas propped up with a crutch on one side and was eyeing Emily\n\n\fwith enormous interest.",
    "She had no difficulty in identifying him as\nCaptain Wyatt the invalid owner of No.",

    "No I havent said Emily.",
    "Shes got out said Captain Wyatt.",
    "An affectionate creature but\nan absolute fool.",

    "Charabancs do in the summer time said Captain Wyatt grimly.",
    "Its the three and sixpenny morning run from Exhampton.",
    "Ascent of\nSittaford Beacon with a halt halfway up from Exhampton for light\nrefreshments.",
    "Yes but this isnt summer time said Emily.",
    "All the same a charabanc came along just now.",
    "Reporters I\nsuppose going to have a look at Sittaford House.",
    "Did you know Captain Trevelyan well asked Emily.",
    "She was of the opinion that the incident of the bull terrier had been\na mere subterfuge on Captain Wyatts part dictated by a very\nnatural curiosity.",
    "She was she was well aware the principal object\nof attention in Sittaford at present and it was only natural that\nCaptain Wyatt should wish to have a look at her as well as everyone\nelse.",
    "I dont know about well said Captain Wyatt.",
    "He sold me this\ncottage.",
    "Yes said Emily encouragingly.",
    "A skinflint thats what he was said Captain Wyatt.",
    "The\narrangement was that he was to do the place up to suit the\npurchasers taste and just because I had the window sashes in\nchocolate picked out in lemon he wanted me to pay half.",
    "Said the\narrangement was for a uniform color.",
    "You didnt like him said Emily.",
    "I was always having rows with him said Captain Wyatt.",
    "But I\nalways have rows with everyone he added as an afterthought.",
    "In\na place like this you have to teach people to leave a man alone.",
    "Always knocking at the door and dropping in and chattering.",
    "I dont\nmind seeing people when I am in the mood  but it has got to be my\nmood not theirs.",
    "No good Trevelyan giving me his Lord of the Manor\nairs and dropping in whenever he felt like it.",
    "Theres not a soul in\nthe place comes near me now he added with satisfaction.",
    "Oh said Emily.",
    "Thats the best of having a native servant said Captain Wyatt.",
    "They understand orders.",
    "Abdul he roared.",
    "A tall Indian in a turban came out of the cottage and waited\nattentively.",

    "Oh no you havent said Captain Wyatt.",
    "Yes I have said Emily.",
    "Ive got an appointment.",
    "Nobody understands the art of living nowadays said Captain\nWyatt.",
    "Catching trains making appointments fixing times for\neverything  all nonsense.",
    "Get up with the sun I say have your\nmeals when you feel like it and never tie yourself to a time or a\ndate.",
    "I could teach people how to live if they would listen to me.",
    "The results of this exalted idea of living were not too hopeful Emily\nreflected.",
    "Anything more like a battered wreck of a man than\nCaptain Wyatt she had never seen.",
    "However feeling that his\ncuriosity had been sufficiently satisfied for the time being she\ninsisted once more on her appointment and went on her way.",
    "Sittaford House had a solid oak front door a neat bell pull an\nimmense wire mat and a brilliantly polished brass letter box.",
    "It\nrepresented as Emily could not fail to see comfort and decorum.",
    "A\nneat and conventional parlormaid answered the bell.",
    "Emily deduced the journalist evil had been before her as the\nparlormaid said at once in a distant tone Mrs Willett is not seeing\nanyone this morning.",
    "I have brought a note from Miss Percehouse said Emily.",
    "This clearly altered matters.",
    "The parlormaids face expressed\nindecision then she shifted her ground.",
    "Will you come inside please.",

    "She was a very pretty girl Emily noticed smartly and\nexpensively dressed and she also thought that she had never seen\na girl in a greater state of nervous apprehension.",
    "Not that this was\napparent on the surface however.",
    "Miss Willett was making a gallant\nappearance of being entirely at her ease.",
    "Good morning she said advancing and shaking hands.",
    "Im so\nsorry mother isnt down but shes spending the morning in bed.",
    "Oh I am so sorry Im afraid I have come at an unfortunate time.",
    "No of course not.",
    "The cook is writing out the recipe for that cake\nnow.",
    "We are only too delighted for Miss Percehouse to have it.",
    "Are\nyou staying with her\n\n\fEmily reflected with an inward smile that this was perhaps the only\nhouse in Sittaford whose members were not exactly aware of who\nshe was and why she was there.",
    "Sittaford House had a definite\nregime of employers and employed.",
    "The employed might know\nabout her  the employers clearly did not.",
    "I am not exactly staying with her said Emily.",
    "In fact Im at Mrs\nCurtiss.",
    "Of course the cottage is terribly small and she has her nephew\nRonnie with her hasnt she I suppose there wouldnt be room for\nyou too.",
    "Shes a wonderful person isnt she So much character I\nalways think but I am rather afraid of her really.",
    "Shes a bully isnt she agreed Emily cheerfully.",
    "But its an awful\ntemptation to be a bully especially if people wont stand up to you.",
    "Miss Willett sighed.",
    "I wish I could stand up to people she said.",
    "Weve had the most\nawful morning absolutely pestered by reporters.",
    "Oh of course said Emily.",
    "This is Captain Trevelyans house\nreally isnt it  the man who was murdered at Exhampton.",
    "She was trying to determine the exact cause of Violet Willetts\nnervousness.",
    "The girl was clearly on the jump.",
    "Something was\nfrightening her  and frightening her badly.",
    "She mentioned Captain\nTrevelyans name bluntly on purpose.",
    "The girl didnt noticeably\n\n\freact to it in any way but then she was probably expecting some\nsuch reference.",
    "Yes wasnt it dreadful\n\nDo tell me  thats if you dont mind talking about it\n\nNo  no  of course not  why should I\n\nTheres something very wrong with this girl thought Emily.",
    "She\nhardly knows what shes saying.",
    "What has made her get the wind\nup this morning particularly\n\nAbout that table turning went on Emily.",
    "I heard about it in a\ncasual sort of way and it seemed to me so frightfully interesting  I\nmean so absolutely gruesome.",
    "Girlish thrills she thought to herself thats my line.",
    "Oh it was horrid said Violet.",
    "That evening  I shall never forget\nit We thought of course that it was somebody just fooling  only it\nseemed a very nasty kind of joke.",
    "Yes\n\nI shall never forget when we turned the lights on  everybody\nlooked so queer.",
    "Not Mr Duke and Major Burnaby  they are the\nstolid kind they would never like to admit that they were impressed\nby anything of that kind.",
    "But you could see that Major Burnaby was\nreally awfully rattled by it.",
    "I think that actually he believed in it more\n\n\fthan anybody else.",
    "But I thought poor little Mr Rycroft was going to\nhave a heart attack or something yet he must be used to that kind\nof thing because he does a lot of psychic research and as for\nRonnie Ronnie Garfield you know  he looked as though he had\nseen a ghost  actually seen one.",
    "Even mother was awfully upset more than I have ever seen her before.",
    "It must have been most spooky said Emily.",
    "I wish I had been\nthere to see.",
    "It was rather horrid really.",
    "We all pretended that it was  just fun\nyou know but it didnt seem like that.",
    "And then Major Burnaby\nsuddenly made up his mind to go over to Exhampton and we all\ntried to stop him and said he would be buried in a snowdrift but he\nwould go.",
    "And there we sat after he had gone all feeling dreadful\nand worried.",
    "And then last night  no yesterday morning  we got\nthe news.",
    "You think it was Captain Trevelyans spirit said Emily in an awed\nvoice.",
    "Or do you think it was clairvoyance or telepathy\n\nOh I dont know.",
    "But I shall never never laugh at these things\nagain.",
    "The parlormaid entered with a folded piece of paper on a salver\nwhich she handed to Violet.",
    "The parlormaid withdrew and Violet unfolded the paper glanced\nover it and handled it to Emily.",
    "There you are she said.",
    "As a matter of fact you are just in time.",
    "This murder business has upset the servants.",
    "They think its\ndangerous to live in this out of the way part.",
    "Mother lost her temper\nwith them yesterday evening and has sent them all packing.",
    "They\nare going after lunch.",
    "We are going to get two men instead  a\nhouseparlorman and a kind of butlerchauffeur.",
    "I think it will\nanswer much better.",
    "Servants are silly arent they said Emily.",
    "It isnt even as if Captain Trevelyan had been killed in this house.",
    "What made you think of coming to live here asked Emily trying\nto make the question sound artless and girlishly natural.",
    "Oh we thought it would be rather fun said Violet.",
    "Dont you find it rather dull\n\nOh no I love the country.",
    "But her eyes avoided Emilys.",
    "Just for a moment she looked\nsuspicious and afraid.",
    "She stirred uneasily in her chair and Emily rose rather reluctantly to\nher feet.",
    "I must be going now she said.",
    "Thank you so much Miss Willett.",
    "I\ndu hope your mother will be all right.",
    "Oh shes quite well really.",
    "Its only the servants  and all the\nworry.",
    "Of course.",
    "Adroitly unperceived by the others Emily managed to discard her\nglove on a small table.",
    "Violet Willett accompanied her to the front\ndoor and they took leave of each other with a few pleasant remarks.",
    "The parlormaid who had opened the door to Emily had unlocked it\nbut as Violet Willett closed it behind her retreating guest Emily\ncaught no sound of the key being turned.",
    "When she reached the\ngate therefore she retraced her steps slowly.",
    "Her visit had more than confirmed the theories she held about\nSittaford House.",
    "There was something queer going on here.",
    "She\ndidnt think Violet Willett was directly implicated  that is unless she\nwas a very clever actress indeed.",
    "But there was something wrong\nand that something must have a connection with the tragedy.",
    "There\nmust be some link between the Willetts and Captain Trevelyan and\nin that link there might lie the clue to the whole mystery.",
    "She came up to the front door turned the handle very gently and\npassed across the threshold.",
    "The hall was deserted.",
    "Emily paused\nuncertain what to do next.",
    "She had her excuse  the gloves left\nthoughtfully behind in the drawingroom.",
    "She stood stock still\nlistening.",
    "There was no sound anywhere except a very faint murmur\nof voices from upstairs.",
    "As quietly as possible Emily crept to the\nfoot of the stairs and stood looking up.",
    "Then very gingerly she\nascended a step at a time.",
    "This was rather more risky.",
    "She could\n\n\fhardly pretend that her gloves had walked of their own accord to\nthe first floor but she had a burning desire to overhear something\nof the conversation that was going on upstairs.",
    "Modern builders\nnever made their doors fit well in Emilys opinion.",
    "You could hear a\nmurmur of voices down here.",
    "Therefore if you reached the door\nitself you would hear plainly the conversation that was going on\ninside the room.",
    "Another step  one more again... Two womens\nvoices  Violet and her mother without doubt.",
    "Suddenly there was a break in the conversation  a sound of\nfootsteps.",
    "Emily retreated rapidly.",
    "When Violet Willett opened her mothers door and came down the\nstairs she was surprised to find her late guest standing in the hall\npeering about her in a lost dog kind of way.",
    "My gloves she explained.",
    "I must have left them.",
    "I came back for\nthem.",
    "I expect they are in here said Violet.",
    "They went into the drawingroom and there sure enough on a little\ntable near where Emily had been sitting lay the missing gloves.",
    "Oh thank you said Emily.",
    "Its so stupid of me.",
    "I am always\nleaving things.",
    "And you want gloves in this weather said Violet.",
    "Its so cold.",
    "Once again they parted at the hall door and this time Emily heard\nthe key being turned in the lock.",
    "She went down the drive with plenty to think about for as that door\non the upper landing had opened she had heard distinctly one\nsentence spoken in an older womans fretful and plaintive voice\n\nMy God the voice had wailed I cant bear it.",
    "Will tonight never\ncome\n\nChapter 19\n\nTHEORIES\n\nEmily arrived back at the cottage to find her boy friend absent.",
    "He\nhad Mrs Curtis explained gone off with several other young\ngentlemen but two telegrams had come for the young lady.",
    "Emily\ntook them opened them and put them in the pocket of her sweater\nMrs Curtis eyeing them hungrily the while.",
    "Not bad news I hope said Mrs Curtis.",
    "Oh no said Emily.",
    "Always gives me a turn a telegram does said Mrs Curtis.",
    "I know said Emily.",
    "Very disturbing.",
    "At the moment she felt disinclined for anything but solitude.",
    "She\nwanted to sort out and arrange her own ideas.",
    "She went up to her\n\n\fown room and taking pencil and notepaper she set to work on a\nsystem of her own.",
    "After twenty minutes of this exercise she was\ninterrupted by Mr Enderby.",
    "Hullo hullo hullo there you are.",
    "Fleet Street has been hard on\nyour tracks all morning but they have just missed you everywhere.",
    "Anyway they have had it from me that you are not to be worried.",
    "As\nfar as youre concerned I am the big noise.",
    "He sat down on the chair Emily was occupying the bed and\nchuckled.",
    "Envy and malice isnt in it he said.",
    "I have been handing them out\nthe goods.",
    "I know everyone and I am right in it.",
    "Its too good to be\ntrue.",
    "I keep pinching myself and feeling I will wake up in a minute.",
    "I\nsay have you noticed the fog\n\nIt wont stop me going to Exeter this afternoon will it said Emily.",
    "Do you want to go to Exeter\n\nYes.",
    "I have to meet Mr Dacres there.",
    "My solicitor you know  the\none who is undertaking Jims defence.",
    "He wants to see me.",
    "And I\nthink I shall pay a visit to Jims Aunt Jennifer while I am there.",
    "After\nall Exeter is only half an hour away.",
    "Meaning she might have nipped over by train and batted her\nbrother over the head and nobody would have noticed her\nabsence.",
    "Oh I know it sounds rather improbable but one has to go into\neverything.",
    "Not that I want it to be Aunt Jennifer  I dont.",
    "I would\nmuch rather it was Martin Dering.",
    "I hate the sort of man who\npresumes on going to be a brotherinlaw and does things in public\nthat you cant smack his face for.",
    "Is he that kind\n\nVery much that kind.",
    "Hes an ideal person for a murderer  always\ngetting telegrams from bookmakers and losing money on horses.",
    "Its annoying that hes got such a good alibi.",
    "Mr Dacres told me\nabout it.",
    "A publisher and a literary dinner seems so very\nunbreakable and respectable.",
    "A literary dinner said Enderby.",
    "Friday night.",
    "Martin Dering  let\nme see  Martin Dering  why yes  I am almost sure of it.",
    "Dash it all I\nam quite sure of it but I can clinch things by wiring to Carruthers.",
    "What are you talking about said Emily.",
    "Listen.",
    "You know I came down to Exhampton on Friday evening.",
    "Well there was a bit of information I was going to get from a pal of\nmine another newspaper man Carruthers his name is.",
    "He was\ncoming round to see me about half past six if he could  before he\nwent on to some literary dinner  he is rather a big bug Carruthers\nand if he couldnt make it he would send me a line to Exhampton.",
    "Well he didnt make it and he did send me a line.",
    "What has all this got to do with it said Emily.",
    "Dont be so impatient I am coming to the point.",
    "The old chap was\nrather screwed when he wrote it  done himself well at the dinner after giving me the item I wanted he went on to waste a good bit of\njuicy description on me.",
    "You know  about the speeches and what\nasses so and so a famous novelist and a famous playwright were.",
    "And he said he had been rottenly placed at the dinner.",
    "There was\nan empty seat on one side of him where the sex specialist Martin\nDering ought to have been but he moved up near to a poet who is\nvery well known in Blackheath and tried to make the best of things.",
    "Now do you see the point\n\nCharles Darling Emily became lyrical with excitement.",
    "How\nmarvelous.",
    "Then the brute wasnt at the dinner at all\n\nExactly.",
    "You are sure youve remembered the name right\n\nIm positive.",
    "I have torn up the letter worse luck but I can always\nwire to Carruthers to make sure.",
    "But I absolutely know that Im not\nmistaken.",
    "Theres the publisher still of course said Emily.",
    "The one he\nspent the afternoon with.",
    "But I rather think it was a publisher who\nwas just going back to America and if so that looks fishy.",
    "I mean it\nlooks as though he had selected someone who couldnt be asked\nwithout rather a lot of trouble.",
    "Do you really think we have hit it said Charles Enderby.",
    "Well it looks like it.",
    "I think the best thing to be done is to go\nstraight to that nice Inspector Narracott and just tell him these new\nfacts.",
    "I mean we cant tackle an American publisher who is on the\nMauretania or the Berengaria or somewhere.",
    "Thats a job for the\npolice.",
    "My word if this comes off.",
    "What a scoop said Mr Enderby.",
    "If it\ndoes I should think the Daily Wire couldnt offer me less than \n\nEmily broke in ruthlessly into his dreams of advancement.",
    "But we mustnt lose our heads she said and throw everything\nelse to the wind.",
    "I must go to Exeter.",
    "I dont suppose I shall be able\nto be back here until tomorrow.",
    "But Ive got a job for you.",
    "What kind of a job\n\nEmily described her visit to the Willetts and the strange sentence\nshe had overheard on leaving.",
    "We have got absolutely and positively to find out what is going to\nhappen tonight.",
    "Theres something in the wind.",
    "What an extraordinary thing\n\nWasnt it But of course it may be a coincidence.",
    "Or it may not  but\nyou observe that the servants are being cleared out of the way.",
    "Something queer is going to happen there tonight and you have to\nbe on the spot to see what it is.",
    "You mean I have to spend the whole night shivering under a bush\nin the garden\n\nWell you dont mind that do you Journalists dont mind what they\ndo in a good cause.",
    "Who told you that\n\nNever mind who told me I know it.",
    "You will do it wont you\n\nOh rather said Charles.",
    "I am not going to miss anything.",
    "If\nanything queer goes on at Sittaford House tonight I shall be in it.",
    "Emily then told him about the luggage label.",
    "Its odd said Mr Enderby.",
    "Australia is where the third Pearson is\nisnt it  the youngest one.",
    "Not of course that that means\nanything but still it  well there might be a connection.",
    "Hm said Emily.",
    "I think thats all.",
    "Have you anything to report on\nyour side\n\nWell said Charles Ive got an idea.",
    "Yes\n\nThe only thing is I dont know how youll like it.",
    "What do you mean  how Ill like it\n\n\fYou wont fly out over it will you\n\nI dont suppose so.",
    "I mean I hope I can listen sensibly and quietly\nto anything.",
    "Well the point is said Charles Enderby eyeing her doubtfully\ndont think I mean to be offensive or anything like that but do you\nthink that lad of yours is to be depended on for the strict truth\n\nDo you mean said Emily that he did murder him after all You\nare quite welcome to that view if you like.",
    "I said to you at the\nbeginning that that was the natural view to take but I said we had\nto work on the assumption that he didnt.",
    "I dont mean that said Enderby.",
    "I am with you in assuming that\nhe didnt do the old boy in.",
    "What I mean is how far is his own story\nof what happened true He says that he went there had a chat with\nthe old fellow and came away leaving him alive and well.",
    "Yes.",
    "Well it just occurred to me you dont think its possible that he\nwent there and actually found the old man dead I mean he might\nhave got the wind up and been scared and not liked to say so.",
    "Charles had propounded this theory rather dubiously but he was\nrelieved to find that Emily showed no signs of flying out at him over\nit.",
    "Instead she frowned and creased her brow in thought.",
    "I am not going to pretend she said.",
    "It is possible.",
    "I hadnt\nthought of it before.",
    "I know Jim wouldnt murder anyone but he\nmight quite well get rattled and tell a silly lie and then of course he\nwould have to stick to it.",
    "Yes it is quite possible.",
    "The awkward thing is that you cant go and ask him about it now.",
    "I\nmean they wouldnt let you see him alone would they\n\nI can put Mr Dacres on to him said Emily.",
    "You see your solicitor\nalone I believe.",
    "The worst of Jim is that he is frightfully obstinate if\nhe has once said a thing he sticks to it.",
    "Thats my story and Im going to stick to it said Mr Enderby\ncomprehendingly.",
    "Yes.",
    "I am glad you mentioned that possibility to me Charles it\nhadnt occurred to me.",
    "We have been looking for someone who\ncame in after Jim had left  but if it was before \n\nShe paused lost in thought.",
    "Two very different theories stretched\nout in opposite directions.",
    "There was the one suggested by Mr\nRycroft in which Jims quarrel with his uncle was the determining\npoint.",
    "The other theory however took no cognizance of Jim\nwhatsoever.",
    "The first thing to do Emily felt was to see the doctor\nwho had first examined the body.",
    "If it were possible that Captain\nTrevelyan had been murdered at  say  four oclock it might make a\nconsiderable difference to the question of alibis.",
    "And the other\nthing to do was to make Mr Dacres urge most strongly on his client\nthe absolute necessity of speaking the truth on this point.",
    "She rose from the bed.",
    "Well she said you had better find out how I can get to\nExhampton.",
    "The man at the smithy has a car of a kind I believe.",
    "Will\nyou go and settle with him about it Ill start immediately after\nlunch.",
    "Theres a train at threeten to Exeter.",
    "That will give me time\nto see the doctor first.",
    "Whats the time now\n\nHalf past twelve said Mr Enderby consulting his watch.",
    "Then we will both go up and fix up about that car said Emily.",
    "And\ntheres just one other thing I want to do before leaving Sittaford.",
    "Whats that\n\nI am going to pay a call on Mr Duke.",
    "Hes the only person in\nSittaford I havent seen.",
    "And he was one of the people at the table\nturning.",
    "Oh well pass his cottage on the way to the smithy.",
    "Mr Dukes cottage was the last of the row.",
    "Emily and Charles\nunlatched the gate and walked up the path.",
    "And then something\nrather surprising occurred.",
    "For the door opened and a man came\nout.",
    "And that man was Inspector Narracott.",
    "He too looked surprised and Emily fancied embarrassed.",
    "Emily\nabandoned her original intention.",
    "I am so glad to have meet you Inspector Narracott she said.",
    "There are one or two things I want to talk to you about if I may.",
    "Delighted Miss Trefusis.",
    "He drew out a watch.",
    "Im afraid you will\nhave to look sharp Ive a car waiting.",
    "Ive got to go back to\nExhampton almost immediately.",
    "How extraordinarily fortunate said Emily you might give me a\nlift will you Inspector\n\nThe Inspector said rather woodenly that he would be very pleased\nto do so.",
    "You might go and get my suitcase Charles said Emily.",
    "Its\npacked up and ready.",
    "Charles departed immediately.",
    "Its a great surprise meeting you here Miss Trefusis said\nInspector Narracott.",
    "I said au revoir Emily reminded him.",
    "I didnt notice it at the time.",
    "Youve not seen the last of me by a long way said Emily candidly.",
    "You know Inspector Narracott youve made a mistake.",
    "Jims not\nthe man youre after.",
    "Indeed\n\n\fAnd whats more said Emily I believe in your heart that you\nagree with me.",
    "What makes you think that Miss Trefusis\n\nWhat were you doing in Mr Dukes cottage retaliated Emily.",
    "Narracott looked embarrassed and she was quick to follow it up.",
    "Youre doubtful Inspector  thats what you are  doubtful.",
    "You\nthought you had got the right man and now you are not so sure and\nso you are making a few investigations.",
    "Well I have got something\nto tell you that may help.",
    "Ill tell it to you on the way to Exhampton.",
    "Footsteps sounded down the road and Ronnie Garfield appeared.",
    "He had the air of a truant breathless and guilty.",
    "I say Miss Trefusis he began.",
    "What about a walk this afternoon\nWhile my aunt has a nap you know.",
    "Impossible said Emily.",
    "Im going away.",
    "To Exeter.",
    "What not really For good you mean\n\nOh no said Emily.",
    "I shall be back again tomorrow.",
    "Oh thats splendid.",
    "Emily took something from the pocket of her sweater and handed it\nto him.",
    "Give that to your aunt will you Its a recipe for coffee\ncake and tell her that she was just in time the cook is leaving today\nand so are the other servants.",
    "Be sure you tell her she will be\ninterested.",
    "A far off scream was borne on the breeze.",
    "Ronnie it said\nRonnie Ronnie.",
    "Theres my aunt said Ronnie starting nervously.",
    "I had better\ngo.",
    "I think you had said Emily.",
    "Youve got green paint on your left\ncheek she called after him.",
    "Ronnie Garfield disappeared through\nhis aunts gate.",
    "Heres my boy friend with my suitcase said Emily.",
    "Come on\nInspector.",
    "Ill tell you everything in the car.",
    "Chapter 20\n\nVISIT TO AUNT JENNIFER\n\nAt half past two Dr Warren received a call from Emily.",
    "He took an\nimmediate fancy to this businesslike and attractive girl.",
    "Her\nquestions were blunt and to the point.",
    "Yes Miss Trefusis I see exactly what you mean.",
    "Youll understand\nthat contrary to the popular belief in novels it is extremely difficult\nto fix the time of death accurately.",
    "I saw the body at eight oclock.",
    "I\ncan say decidedly that Captain Trevelyan had been dead at least\ntwo hours.",
    "How much longer than that would be difficult to say.",
    "If\nyou were to tell me that he was killed at four oclock I should say\nthat it was possible though my own opinion inclines to a later time.",
    "On the other hand he could certainly not have been dead for much\nlonger than that.",
    "Four and a half hours would be the outside limit.",
    "Thank you said Emily thats all that I wanted to know.",
    "She caught the threeten train at the station and drove straight to\nthe hotel where Mr Dacres was staying.",
    "Their interview was businesslike and unemotional.",
    "Mr Dacres had\nknown Emily since she was a small child and had managed her\naffairs for her since she came of age.",
    "You must prepare yourself for a shock Emily he said.",
    "Things\nare much worse for Jim Pearson than we imagined.",
    "Worse\n\nYes.",
    "Its no good beating about the bush.",
    "Certain facts have come\nto light which are bound to show him up in a most unfavorable light.",
    "It is those facts which led the police actually to charge him with the\ncrime.",
    "I should not be acting in your interests if I withheld these\nfacts from you.",
    "Please tell me said Emily.",
    "Her voice was perfectly calm and composed.",
    "Whatever the inward\nshock she might have felt she had no intention of making an\noutward display of her feelings.",
    "It was not feelings that were going\nto help Jim Pearson it was brains.",
    "She must keep all her wits about\nher.",
    "There is no doubt that he was in urgent and immediate need of\nmoney.",
    "I am not going to enter into the ethics of the situation at the\nmoment.",
    "Pearson\n\nhad\n\napparently\n\nbefore\n\nnow\n\noccasionally\n\nborrowed money  to use a euphemism  from his firm  I may say\nwithout their knowledge.",
    "He was fond of speculating in shares and\non one occasion previously knowing that certain dividends were to\nbe paid into his account in a weeks time he anticipated them by\nusing the firms money to buy certain shares which he had pretty\ncertain knowledge were bound to go up.",
    "The transaction was quite\nsatisfactory the money was replaced and Pearson really doesnt\nseem to have had any doubts as to the honesty of the transaction.",
    "Apparently he repeated this just over a week ago.",
    "This time an\nunforeseen thing occurred.",
    "The books of the firm are examined at\ncertain stated times but for some reason or other this date was\nadvanced and Pearson was faced with a very unpleasant dilemma.",
    "He was quite aware of the construction that would be put on his\naction and he was quite unable to raise the sum of money involved.",
    "He admits himself that he had tried in various quarters and failed\nwhen as a last resource he rushed down to Devonshire to lay the\nmatter before his uncle and persuade him to help him.",
    "This Captain\nTrevelyan absolutely refused to do.",
    "Now my dear Emily we shall be quite unable to prevent these\nfacts from being brought to light.",
    "The police have already\nunearthed the matter.",
    "And you see dont you that we have here a\nvery pressing and urgent motive for the crime The moment\nCaptain Trevelyan was dead Pearson could easily have obtained\nthe necessary sum as an advance from Mr Kirkwood and saved\nhimself from disaster and possibly criminal prosecution.",
    "Oh the idiot said Emily helplessly.",
    "Quite so said Mr Dacres dryly.",
    "It seems to me that our only\nchance lies in proving that Jim Pearson was quite unaware of the\nprovisions of his uncles will.",
    "There was a pause while Emily considered the matter.",
    "Then she said quietly\n\nIm afraid thats impossible.",
    "All three of them knew  Sylvia Jim\nand Brian.",
    "They often discussed it and laughed and joked about the\nrich uncle in Devonshire.",
    "Dear dear said Mr Dacres.",
    "Thats unfortunate.",
    "You dont think him guilty Mr Dacres asked Emily.",
    "Curiously enough I do not replied the lawyer.",
    "In some ways Jim\nPearson is a most transparent young man.",
    "He hasnt if you will\nallow me to say so Emily a very high standard of commercial\n\n\fhonesty but I do not believe for one minute that his hand\nsandbagged his uncle.",
    "Well thats a good thing said Emily.",
    "I wish the police thought the\nsame.",
    "Quite so.",
    "Our own impressions and ideas are of no practical use.",
    "The case against him is unfortunately strong.",
    "I am not going to\ndisguise from you my dear child that the outlook is bad.",
    "I should\nsuggest Lorimer K.C.",
    "as the defence.",
    "Forlorn hope man they call\nhim he added cheerfully.",
    "There is one thing I should like to know said Emily.",
    "You have of course seen Jim\n\nCertainly.",
    "I want you to tell me honestly if you think he has told the truth in\nother respects.",
    "She outlined to him the idea that Enderby had\nsuggested to her.",
    "The lawyer considered the matter carefully before replying.",
    "Its my impression he said that he is speaking the truth when he\ndescribes his interview with his uncle.",
    "But there is little doubt that\nhe has got the wind up badly and if he went round to the window\nentered that way and came across his uncles dead body  he might\njust possibly be too scared to admit the fact and have concocted\nthis other story.",
    "Thats what I thought said Emily.",
    "Next time you see him Mr\nDacres will you urge him to speak the truth It may make the most\ntremendous difference.",
    "I will do so.",
    "All the same he said after a moment or twos pause\nI think you are mistaken in this idea.",
    "The news of Captain\nTrevelyans death was bandied around in Exhampton about eight\nthirty.",
    "At that time the last train had left for Exeter but Jim Pearson\ngot the first train available in the morning  a thoroughly unwise\nproceeding by the way as it called attention to his movements\nwhich without would not have been aroused if he had left by a train\nat a more conventional hour.",
    "Now if as you suggest he discovered\nhis uncles dead body some time after half past four I think he\nwould have left Exhampton straight away.",
    "Theres a train which\nleaves shortly after six and another at a quarter to eight.",
    "Thats a point admitted Emily I didnt think of that.",
    "I have questioned him narrowly about his method of entering his\nuncles house went on Mr Dacres.",
    "He says that Captain\nTrevelyan made him remove his boots and leave them on the\ndoorstep.",
    "That accounts for no wet marks being discovered in the\nhall.",
    "He doesnt speak of having heard any sound  anything at all  that\ngives him the idea that there might have been someone else in the\nhouse\n\nHe didnt mention it to me.",
    "But I will ask him.",
    "Thank you said Emily.",
    "If I write a note can you take it to him\n\nSubject to its being read of course.",
    "Oh it will be a very discreet one.",
    "She crossed to the writing table and scribbled a few words.",
    "Dearest Jim\n\nEverythings going to be all right so cheer up.",
    "I am working like\nfury to find out the truth.",
    "What an idiot youve been darling.",
    "Love from\n\nEmily.",
    "There she said.",
    "Mr Dacres read it but made no comment.",
    "I have taken pains with my handwriting said Emily so that the\nprison authorities can read it easily.",
    "Now I must be off.",
    "You will allow me to offer you a cup of tea.",
    "No thank you Mr Dacres.",
    "I have no time to lose.",
    "I am going to see\nJims Aunt Jennifer.",
    "At The Laurels Emily was informed that Mrs Gardner was out but\nwould be home shortly.",
    "Emily smiled upon the parlormaid.",
    "Ill come in and wait then.",
    "Would you like to see Nurse Davis\n\nEmily was always ready to see anybody.",
    "Yes she said promptly.",
    "A few minutes later Nurse Davis starched and curious arrived.",
    "How do you do said Emily.",
    "I am Emily Trefusis  a kind of niece of\nMrs Gardners.",
    "That is I am going to be a niece but my fianc\u0439e Jim\nPearson has been arrested as I expect you know.",
    "Oh its been too dreadful said Nurse Davis.",
    "We saw it all in the\npapers this morning.",
    "What a terrible business.",
    "You seem to be\nbearing up wonderfully Miss Trefusis  really wonderfully.",
    "There was a faint note of disapproval in the Nurses voice.",
    "Hospital\nnurses she implied were able to bear up owing to their force of\ncharacter but lesser mortals were expected to give way.",
    "Well one mustnt sag at the knees said Emily.",
    "I hope you dont\nmind very much.",
    "I mean it must be awkward for you to be\nassociated with a family that has got a murder in it.",
    "Its very unpleasant of course said Nurse Davis unbending at\nthis proof of consideration.",
    "But ones duty to ones patient comes\nbefore everything.",
    "How splendid said Emily.",
    "It must be wonderful for Aunt Jennifer\nto feel she has somebody upon whom she can rely.",
    "Oh really said the Nurse simpering you are too kind.",
    "But of\ncourse I have had curious experiences before this.",
    "Why at the last\ncase I attended  Emily listened patiently to a long and scandalous\nanecdote comprising complicated divorce and paternity questions.",
    "After complimenting Nurse Davis on her tact discretion and savoir\nfaire Emily slid back to the topic of the Gardners.",
    "I dont know Aunt Jennifers husband at all she said.",
    "Ive never\nmet him.",
    "He never goes away from home does he\n\nNo poor fellow.",
    "What exactly is the matter with him\n\nNurse Davis embarked on the subject with professional gusto.",
    "So really he might get well again any minute Emily murmured\nthoughtfully.",
    "He would be terribly weak said the Nurse.",
    "Oh of course.",
    "But it makes it seem more hopeful doesnt it\n\nThe Nurse shook her head with firm professional despondency.",
    "I dont suppose there will be any cure in his case.",
    "Emily had copied down in her little notebook the timetable of what\nshe called Aunt Jennifers alibi.",
    "She now murmured tentatively\n\nHow queer it seems to think that Aunt Jennifer was actually at the\nPictures when her brother was being killed.",
    "Very sad isnt it said Nurse Davis.",
    "Of course she couldnt tell but it gives one such a shock afterwards.",
    "Emily cast about in her mind to find out what she wanted to know\nwithout asking a direct question.",
    "Didnt she have some queer kind of vision or premonition she\ninquired.",
    "Wasnt it you who met her in the hall when she came in\nand exclaimed that she looked quite queer\n\nOh no said the Nurse.",
    "It wasnt me.",
    "I didnt see her until we\nwere sitting down to dinner together and she seemed quite her\nordinary self then.",
    "How very interesting.",
    "I expect I am mixing it up with something else said Emily.",
    "Perhaps it was some other relation suggested Nurse Davis.",
    "I\ncame in rather late myself.",
    "I felt rather guilty about leaving my\npatient so long but he himself had urged me to go.",
    "She suddenly looked at her watch.",
    "Oh dear.",
    "He asked me for another hot water bottle.",
    "I must see\nabout it at once.",
    "Will you excuse me Miss Trefusis\n\nEmily excused her and going over to the fireplace she put her finger\non the bell.",
    "The slipshod maid came with rather a frightened face.",
    "Whats your name said Emily.",
    "Beatrice Miss.",
    "Oh Beatrice I may not be able to wait to see my aunt  Mrs\nGardner after all  I wanted to ask her about some shopping she\ndid on Friday.",
    "Do you know if she brought a big parcel back with\nher\n\nNo Miss I didnt see her come in.",
    "I thought you said she came in at six oclock.",
    "Yes Miss she did I didnt see her come in but when I went to take\nsome hot water to her room at seven oclock it gave me a shock to\nfind her lying in the dark on the bed.",
    "Well maam I said to her\n\n\fYou gave me quite a shock.",
    "I came in quite a long time ago.",
    "At six\noclock she said.",
    "I didnt see a big parcel anywhere said Beatrice\ntrying her hardest to be helpful.",
    "Its all very difficult thought Emily.",
    "One has to invent so many\nthings.",
    "Ive already invented a premonition and a big parcel but so\nfar as I can see one has to invent something if one doesnt want to\nsound suspicious.",
    "She smiled sweetly and said\n\nThats all right Beatrice it doesnt matter.",
    "Beatrice left the room.",
    "Emily took a small local timetable out of her\nhandbag and consulted it.",
    "Leave Exeter St Davids three ten she murmured Arrive\nExhampton three fortytwo.",
    "Time allowed for going to brothers\nhouse and murdering him  how beastly and coldblooded it sounds\n and such nonsense too  say half an hour to three quarters.",
    "What\nare the trains back Theres one at four twentyfive and theres one\nMr Dacres mentioned at six ten that gets in at twentythree minutes\nto seven.",
    "Yes its actually possible either way.",
    "Its a pity theres\nnothing to suspect the Nurse for.",
    "She was out all the afternoon and\nnobody knows where she was.",
    "But you cant have a murder without\nany motive at all.",
    "Of course I dont really believe anybody in this\nhouse murdered Captain Trevelyan but in a way its comforting to\nknow that they could have.",
    "Hello  theres the front door.",
    "There was a murmur of voices in the hall and the door opened and\nJennifer Gardner came into the room.",
    "Im Emily Trefusis said Emily.",
    "You know  the one who is\nengaged to Jim Pearson.",
    "So you are Emily said Mrs Gardner shaking hands.",
    "Well this is a\nsurprise.",
    "Suddenly Emily felt very weak and small.",
    "Rather like a little girl in\nthe act of doing something very silly.",
    "An extraordinary person Aunt\nJennifer.",
    "Character  that was what it was.",
    "Aunt Jennifer had about\nenough character for two and three quarter people instead of one.",
    "Have you had tea my dear No Then well have it here.",
    "Just a\nmoment  I must go up and see Robert first.",
    "A strange expression flitted over her face as she mentioned her\nhusbands name.",
    "The hard beautiful voice softened.",
    "It was like a\nlight passing over dark ripples of water.",
    "She does adore him thought Emily left alone in the drawingroom.",
    "All the same theres something frightening about Aunt\nJennifer.",
    "I wonder if Uncle Robert likes being adored quite as much\nas that.",
    "When Jennifer Gardner returned she had taken off her hat.",
    "Emily\nadmired the smooth sweep of the hair back from her forehead.",
    "Do you want to talk about things Emily or dont you If you dont I\nshall quite understand.",
    "It isnt much good talking about them is it\n\n\fWe can only hope said Mrs Gardner that they will find the real\nmurderer quickly.",
    "Just press the bell will you Emily Ill send\nNurses tea up to her.",
    "I dont want her chattering down here.",
    "How I\nhate hospital nurses.",
    "Is she a good one\n\nI suppose she is.",
    "Robert says she is anyway.",
    "I dislike her intensely\nand always have.",
    "But Robert says shes far and away the best nurse\nweve had.",
    "Shes rather goodlooking said Emily.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "With her ugly beefy hands\n\nEmily watched her aunts long white fingers as they touched the\nmilk jug and the sugar tongs.",
    "Beatrice came took the cup of tea and a plate of eatables and left\nthe room.",
    "Robert has been very upset over all this said Mrs Gardner.",
    "He\nworks himself into such curious states.",
    "I suppose its all part of his\nillness really.",
    "He didnt know Captain Trevelyan well did he\n\nJennifer Gardner shook her head.",
    "He neither knew him nor cared about him.",
    "To be honest I myself\ncant pretend any great sorrow over his death.",
    "He was a cruel\ngrasping man Emily.",
    "He knew the struggle we have had.",
    "The\npoverty He knew that a loan of money at the right time might have\ngiven Robert special treatment that would have made all the\ndifference.",
    "Well retribution has overtaken him.",
    "She spoke in a deep brooding voice.",
    "What a strange woman she is thought Emily.",
    "Beautiful and\nterrible like something out of a greek tragedy.",
    "Maybe theres still time Mrs Gardner went on.",
    "I wrote to the\nExhampton lawyers today asking if they could forward me some of\nmy inheritance money.",
    "Her face was glowing lit up as though by a lamp.",
    "Emily was tired.",
    "She had had a long day little or nothing to eat and\nshe was worn out by suppressed emotion.",
    "The room kept going\naway and coming back again.",
    "Arent you feeling well dear\n\nIts all right gasped Emily and to her own surprise annoyance\nand humiliation burst into tears.",
    "Mrs Gardner did not attempt to rise and console her for which\nEmily was grateful.",
    "She just sat silently until Emilys tears should\nsubside.",
    "She murmured in a thoughtful voice\n\n\fPoor child.",
    "Its very unlucky that Jim Pearson should have been\narrested  very unlucky.",
    "I wish  something could be done about it.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nCONVERSATIONS\n\nLeft to his own devices Charles Enderby did not relax his efforts.",
    "To\nfamiliarize himself with life as lived in Sittaford village he had only to\nturn on Mrs Curtis much as you would turn on the tap of a hydrant.",
    "Listening slightly dazed to a stream of anecdote reminiscence\nrumors surmise and meticulous detail he endeavored valiantly to\nsift the grain from the chaff.",
    "He then mentioned another name and\nimmediately the force of the water was directed in that direction.",
    "He heard all about Captain Wyatt his tropical temper his rudeness\nhis\n\nquarrels\n\nwith\n\nhis\n\nneighbors\n\nhis\n\noccasional\n\namazing\n\ngraciousness usually to personable young women.",
    "The life he led\nhis Indian servant the peculiar times he had his meals and the\nexact diet that composed them.",
    "He heard about Mr Rycrofts library his hair tonics his insistence\non strict tidiness and punctuality his inordinate curiosity over other\npeoples doings his recent selling of a few old prized personal\npossessions his inexplicable fondness for birds and the prevalent\nidea that Mrs Willett was setting her cap at him.",
    "He heard about Miss Percehouse and her tongue and the way she\nbullied her nephew and of the rumors of the gay life that same\nnephew led in London.",
    "He heard all over again of Major Burnabys\nfriendship with Captain Trevelyan their reminiscences of the past\nand their fondness for chess.",
    "He heard everything that was known about the Willetts including\nthe belief that Miss Violet Willett was leading on Mr Ronnie Garfield\nand that she didnt really mean to have him.",
    "It was hinted that she\nmade mysterious excursions to the moor and that she had been\nseen walking there with a young man.",
    "And it was doubtless for that\nreason so Mrs Curtis had surmised that they had come to this\ndesolate spot.",
    "Her mother had taken her right away to get right\nover it like.",
    "But there  girls can be far more artful than ladies ever\ndream of.",
    "About Mr Duke there was curiously little to hear.",
    "He had been\nthere only a short time and his activities seemed to be solely\nhorticultural.",
    "It was half past three and with his head spinning from the effects of\nMrs Curtiss conversation Mr Enderby went out for a stroll.",
    "His\nintention was to cultivate the acquaintance of Miss Percehouses\nnephew more closely.",
    "Prudent reconnaissance in the neighborhood\nof Miss Percehouses cottage proved unavailing but by a stroke of\ngood fortune he ran into that young man just as he was emerging\ndisconsolately from the gates of Sittaford House.",
    "He had all the\nappearance of having been sent away with a flea in his ear.",
    "Hello said Charles I say isnt that Captain Trevelyans house\n\n\fThats right said Ronnie.",
    "I was hoping to get a snapshot of it this morning.",
    "For my paper\nyou know he added.",
    "But this weather is hopeless for\nphotography.",
    "Ronnie accepted this statement in all good faith without reflecting\nthat if photography was only possible on days of brilliant sunshine\nthe pictures appearing in the daily papers would be few.",
    "It must be a very interesting job  yours he said.",
    "A dogs life said Charles faithful to the convention of never\nshowing enthusiasm about ones work.",
    "He looked over his shoulder\nat Sittaford House.",
    "Rather a gloomy place I should imagine.",
    "No end of a difference there since the Willetts moved in said\nRonnie.",
    "I was down here last year about the same time and really\nyou would hardly take it for the same place and yet I dont know\nquite what they have done.",
    "Moved the furniture about a bit I\nsuppose got cushions and things of that sort about.",
    "Its been a\ngodsend to me their being here I can tell you.",
    "Cant be a very jolly spot as a rule I suppose said Charles.",
    "Jolly If I lived here a fortnight I should pass out altogether.",
    "How\nmy aunt manages to cling on to life in the way she does beats me.",
    "You havent seen her cats have you I had to comb one of them this\n\n\fmorning and look at the way the brute scratched me.",
    "He held out a\nhand and an arm for inspection.",
    "Rather rough luck said Charles.",
    "I should say it was.",
    "I say are you doing any sleuthing If so can I\nhelp Be the Watson to your Sherlock or anything of that kind\n\nAny clues in Sittaford House inquired Charles casually.",
    "I mean\ndid Captain Trevelyan leave any of his things there\n\nI dont think so.",
    "My aunt was saying he moved lock stock and\nbarrel.",
    "Took his elephants trotters and his hippopotamuss toothy\npegs and all the sporting rifles and what nots.",
    "Almost as though he didnt mean to come back said Charles.",
    "I say  thats an idea.",
    "You dont think it was suicide do you\n\nA man who can hit himself correctly on the back of the head with a\nsandbag would be something of an artist in the suicide world said\nCharles.",
    "Yes I thought there wasnt much in that idea.",
    "Looks as if he had\nhad a premonition though Ronnies face brightened.",
    "Look here\nwhat about this Enemies on his track he knows theyre coming so\nhe clears out and passes the buck as it were to the Willetts.",
    "The Willetts were a bit of a miracle by themselves said Charles.",
    "Yes I cant make it out.",
    "Fancy planting yourself down here in the\ncountry like this.",
    "Violet doesnt seem to mind  actually says she\nlikes it.",
    "I dont know whats the matter with her today I suppose its\nthe domestic trouble.",
    "I cant think why women worry so about\nservants.",
    "If they cut up nasty just push them out.",
    "Thats just what they have done isnt it said Charles.",
    "Yes I know.",
    "But they are in a great stew about it all.",
    "Mother lying\ndown with screaming hysterics or something and daughter\nsnapping like a turtle.",
    "Fairly pushed me out just now.",
    "They havent had the police there have they Ronnie stared.",
    "The police no why would they\n\nWell I wondered.",
    "Seeing Inspector Narracott in Sittaford this\nmorning.",
    "Ronnie dropped his stick with a clatter and stooped to pick it up.",
    "Who did you say was in Sittaford this morning  Inspector\nNarracott\n\nYes.",
    "Is he  is he the man in charge of the Trevelyan case\n\nThats right.",
    "What was he doing in Sittaford Where did you see him\n\nOh I suppose he was just nosing about said Charles checking\nup Captain Trevelyans past life so to speak.",
    "You think thats all\n\nI suppose so.",
    "He doesnt think anyone in Sittaford had anything to do with it\n\nThat would be very unlikely wouldnt it\n\nOh frightfully.",
    "But then you know what the police are  always\nbutting in on the wrong tack.",
    "At least thats what it says in detective\nnovels.",
    "I think they are really rather an intelligent body of men said\nCharles.",
    "Of course the Press does a lot to help them he added.",
    "But if you really read a case carefully its amazing the way they\ntrack down murderers with practically no evidence to go on.",
    "Oh  well  its nice to know that isnt it They have certainly got on\nto this man Pearson pretty quick.",
    "It seems a pretty clear case.",
    "Crystal clear said Charles.",
    "A good thing it wasnt you or me eh\nWell I must be sending off a few wires.",
    "They dont seem very used\nto telegrams in this place.",
    "If you send more than half a crowns\nworth at one go they seem to think you are an escaped lunatic.",
    "Charles sent his telegrams bought a packet of cigarettes a few\ndoubtful looking bulls eyes and two very aged paper backed\nnovelettes.",
    "He then returned to the cottage threw himself on his\nbed and slept peacefully blissfully unaware that he and his affairs\nparticularly Miss Emily Trefusis were being discussed in various\nplaces all around him.",
    "It is fairly safe to say that there were only three topics of\nconversation at present in Sittaford.",
    "One was the murder one was\nthe escape of the convict and the other was Miss Emily Trefusis\nand her cousin.",
    "Indeed at a certain moment four separate\nconversations were going on with her as their main theme.",
    "Conversation No.",
    "1 was at Sittaford House where Violet Willett and\nher mother had just washed up their own tea things owing to the\ndomestic retreat.",
    "It was Mrs Curtis who told me said Violet.",
    "She still looked pale\nand wan.",
    "Its almost a disease the way that woman talks said her mother.",
    "I know.",
    "It seems the girl is actually stopping there with a cousin or\nsomething.",
    "She did mention this morning that she was at Mrs\nCurtiss but I thought that that was simply because Miss\nPercehouse hadnt room for her.",
    "And now it seems that shed never\neven seen Miss Percehouse till this morning\n\nI dislike that woman intensely said Mrs Willett.",
    "Mrs Curtis\n\nNo no the Percehouse woman.",
    "That kind of woman is dangerous.",
    "They live for what they can find out about other people.",
    "Sending\nthat girl along here for a recipe for coffee cake Id like to have sent\nher a poisoned cake.",
    "That would have stopped her interfering for\ngood and all\n\nI suppose I ought to have realized  began Violet.",
    "But her mother\ninterrupted her.",
    "How could you my dear And anyway what harm is done\n\nWhy do you think she came here\n\nI dont suppose she had anything definite in mind.",
    "She was just\nspying out the land.",
    "Is Mrs Curtis sure about her being engaged to\nJim Pearson\n\nThe girl told Mr Rycroft so I believe.",
    "Mrs Curtis said she\nsuspected it from the first.",
    "Well then the whole things natural enough.",
    "Shes just looking\nabout aimlessly for something that might help.",
    "You didnt see her mother said Violet.",
    "She isnt aimless.",
    "I wish I had seen her said Mrs Willett.",
    "But my nerves were all to\npieces this morning.",
    "Reaction I suppose after that interview with\nthe police inspector yesterday.",
    "You were wonderful mother.",
    "If only I hadnt been such an utter\nfool  to go and faint.",
    "Oh Im ashamed of myself for giving the whole\nshow away.",
    "And there were you perfectly calm and collected  not\nturning a hair.",
    "Im in pretty good training said Mrs Willett in a hard dry voice.",
    "If\nyoud been through what Ive been through  but there I hope you\nnever will my child.",
    "I trust and believe that youve got a happy\npeaceful life ahead of you.",
    "Violet shook her head.",
    "Im afraid  Im afraid \n\nNonsense  and as for saying you gave the show away by fainting\nyesterday  nothing of the kind.",
    "Dont worry.",
    "But that Inspector  hes bound to think \n\nThat it was the mention of Jim Pearson made you faint Yes  hell\nthink that all right.",
    "Hes no fool that Inspector Narracott.",
    "But what\nif he does Hell suspect a connection  and hell look for it  and he\nwont find it.",
    "You think not\n\nOf course not How can he Trust me Violet dear.",
    "Thats castiron\ncertainty and in a way perhaps that faint of yours was a lucky\nhappening.",
    "Well think so anyway.",
    "Conversation No.",
    "2 was in Major Burnabys cottage.",
    "It was a\nsomewhat onesided one the brunt of it being borne by Mrs Curtis\nwho had been poised for departures for the last half hour having\ndropped in to collect Major Burnabys laundry.",
    "Like my Great Aunt Sarahs Belinda thats what I said to Curtis this\nmorning said Mrs Curtis triumphantly.",
    "A deep one  and one that\ncan twist all the men round her little finger.",
    "A great grunt from Major Burnaby.",
    "Engaged to one young man and carrying on with another said\nMrs Curtis.",
    "Thats my Great Aunt Sarahs Belinda all over.",
    "And not\nfor the fun of it mark you.",
    "Its not just flightiness  shes a deep one.",
    "And now young Mr Garfield  shell have him roped ir before you can\nsay knife.",
    "Never have I seen a young gentleman look more like a\nsheep than he did this morning  and thats a sure sign.",
    "She paused for breath.",
    "Well well said Major Burnaby.",
    "Dont let me keep you Mrs\nCurtis.",
    "Curtis will be wanting his tea and thats a fact said Mrs Curtis\nwithout moving.",
    "I was never one to stand about gossiping.",
    "Get on\nwith your job  thats what I say.",
    "And talking about jobs what do you\nsay sir to a good turn out.",
    "No said Major Burnaby with force.",
    "Its a month since its been done.",
    "No.",
    "I like to know where my things are and everything.",
    "After one of\nthese turn outs nothings ever put back in its place.",
    "Mrs Curtis sighed.",
    "She was an impassioned cleaner and turner out.",
    "Its Captain Wyatt as could do with a Spring cleaning she\nobserved.",
    "That nasty native of his  what does he know about\ncleaning I should like to know Nasty black fellow.",
    "Nothing better than a native servant said Major Burnaby.",
    "They\nknow their job and they dont talk.",
    "Any hint the last sentence might have contained was lost upon Mrs\nCurtis.",
    "Her mind had reverted to a former topic.",
    "Two telegrams she got  two arriving in half an hour.",
    "Gave me quite\na turn it did.",
    "But she read them as cool as anything.",
    "And then she\ntold me she was going to Exeter and wouldnt be back till\ntomorrow.",
    "Did she take her young man with her inquired the Major with a\ngleam of hope.",
    "No hes still here.",
    "A pleasant spoken young gentleman.",
    "He and\nshed make a nice pair.",
    "Grunt from Major Burnaby.",
    "Well said Mrs Curtis.",
    "Ill be getting along.",
    "The Major hardly dared breathe for fear he might distract her from\nher purpose.",
    "But this time Mrs Curtis was as good as her word.",
    "The\ndoor closed behind her.",
    "With a sigh of relief the Major drew forth a pipe and began to peruse\na prospectus of a certain mine which was couched in terms so\nblatantly optimistic that it would have aroused suspicion in any\nheart but that of a widow or a retired soldier.",
    "Twelve per cent murmured Major Burnaby.",
    "That sounds pretty\ngood...\n\nNext door Captain Wyatt was laying down the law to Mr Rycroft.",
    "Fellows like you he said dont know anything of the world.",
    "Youve never lived.",
    "Youve never roughed it.",
    "Mr Rycroft said nothing.",

    "The Captain leaned over the side of his invalid chair.",
    "Wheres that bitch got to Nice looking girl he added.",
    "The\nassociation of ideas in his mind was quite natural.",
    "It was less so to\nMr Rycroft who looked at him in a scandalized fashion.",

    "He then resumed the conversation.",
    "So thats who she is.",
    "Too good for a counter jumper like that.",
    "A girl\nlike that wants a real man.",
    "Young Pearson is very good looking said Mr Rycroft.",
    "Good looking  good looking  a girl doesnt want a barbers block.",
    "What does that sort of young man who works in an office every day\nknow of life What experience has he had of reality\n\nPerhaps the experience of being tried for murder will be sufficient\nreality to last him for some time said Mr Rycroft drily.",
    "Police sure he did it eh\n\nThey must be fairly sure or they wouldnt have arrested him.",
    "Country bumpkins said Captain Wyatt contemptuously.",
    "Not quite said Mr Rycroft.",
    "Inspector Narracott struck me this\nmorning as an able and efficient man.",
    "Where did you see him this morning\n\nHe called at my house.",
    "He didnt call at mine said Captain Wyatt in an injured fashion.",
    "Well you werent a close friend of Trevelyans or anything like\nthat.",

    "Captain\nWyatt continued to urge a drink upon him.",
    "Youd be twice the man if you drank a bit more.",
    "A man who cant\nenjoy a drink isnt a man at all.",
    "But Mr Rycroft continued to decline the offer.",
    "He had already\nconsumed one whiskey and soda of most unusual strength.",
    "What tea do you drink asked Wyatt.",

    "Chapter 22\n\nNOCTURNAL ADVENTURES OF CHARLES\n\nCharles was not looking forward with any relish to the prospect of\nhis nights vigil.",
    "He privately considered that it was likely to be a\nwild goose chase.",
    "Emily he considered was possessed of a too\nvivid imagination.",
    "He was convinced that she had read into the few words she had\noverheard a meaning that had its origin in her own brain.",
    "Probably\nsheer weariness had induced Mrs Willett to yearn for night to come.",
    "Charles looked out of his window and shivered.",
    "It was a piercingly\ncold night raw and foggy  the last night one would wish to spend in\nthe open hanging about and waiting for something very nebulous in\nnature to happen.",
    "Still he dared not yield to his intense desire to remain comfortably\nindoors.",
    "He recalled the liquid melodiousness of Emilys voice as\nshe said Its wonderful to have someone you can really rely on.",
    "She relied on him Charles and she should not rely in vain.",
    "What\nFail that beautiful helpless girl Never.",
    "Besides he reflected as he donned all the spare underclothes he\npossessed before encasing himself in two pullovers and his\novercoat things were likely to be deucedly unpleasant if Emily on\nher return found out that he had not carried out his promise.",
    "She would probably say the most unpleasant things.",
    "No he couldnt\nrisk it.",
    "But as for anything happening \n\nAnd anyway when and how was it going to happen He couldnt be\neverywhere at once.",
    "Probably whatever was going to happen would\nhappen inside Sittaford House and he would never know a thing\nabout it.",
    "Just like a girl he grumbled to himself waltzing off to Exeter and\nleaving me to do the dirty work.",
    "And then he remembered once more the liquid tones of Emilys\nvoice as she expressed her reliance on him and he felt ashamed of\nhis outburst.",
    "He completed his toilet rather after the model of Tweedledee and\neffected a surreptitious exit from the cottage.",
    "The night was even colder and more unpleasant than he had\nthought.",
    "Did Emily realize all he was about to suffer on her behalf\nHe hoped so.",
    "His hand went tenderly to a pocket and caressed a hidden flask\nconcealed in a near pocket.",
    "The boys best friend he murmured.",
    "It would be a night like this\nof course.",
    "With suitable precautions he introduced himself into the grounds of\nSittaford House.",
    "The Willetts kept no dog so there was no fear of\nalarm from that quarter.",
    "A light in the gardeners cottage showed\nthat it was inhabited.",
    "Sittaford House itself was in darkness save for\none lighted window on the first floor.",
    "Those two women are alone in the house thought Charles.",
    "I\nshouldnt care for that myself.",
    "A bit creepy\n\nHe supposed Emily had really overheard that sentence\n\n\fWill tonight never come What did it really mean\n\nI wonder he thought to himself if they mean to do a flit Well\nwhatever happens little Charles is going to be here to see it.",
    "He circled the house at a discreet distance.",

    "What did you do in the Great War Daddy cant have\nbeen any worse than this.",
    "He glanced at his watch and was surprised to find that it was still\nonly twenty minutes to twelve.",
    "He had been convinced that it must\nbe nearly dawn.",
    "An unexpected sound made him prick up his ears excitedly.",
    "It was\nthe sound of a bolt being very gently drawn back in its socket and it\ncame from the direction of the house.",
    "Charles made a noiseless\nspring from bush to bush.",
    "Yes he had been quite right the small\nside door was slowly opening.",
    "A dark figure stood on the threshold.",
    "It was peering anxiously out into the night.",
    "Mrs or Miss Willett said Charles to himself.",
    "The fair Violet I\nthink.",
    "After waiting a minute or two the figure stepped out on the path\nand closed the door noiselessly behind her and started to walk\naway from the house in the opposite direction to the front drive.",
    "The\npath in question led up behind Sittaford House passing through a\nsmall plantation of trees and so out on to the open moor.",
    "The path wound quite near the bushes where Charles was\nconcealed so near that Charles was able to recognize the woman\nas she passed.",
    "He had been quite right it was Violet Willett.",
    "She\nwas wearing a long dark coat and had a beret on her head.",
    "She went on up and as quietly as possible Charles followed her.",
    "He\nhad no fears of being seen but he was alive to the danger of being\noverheard.",
    "He was particularly anxious not to alarm the girl.",
    "Owing\nto his care in this respect she outdistanced him.",
    "For a moment or\ntwo he was afraid lest he should lose her but as he in his turn\nwound his way anxiously through the plantation of trees he saw her\nstanding a little way ahead of him.",
    "Here the low wall which\nsurrounded the estate was broken by a gate.",
    "Violet Willett was\nstanding by this gate leaning over it peering out into the night.",
    "Charles crept up as near as he dared and waited.",
    "The time passed.",
    "The girl had a small pocket torch with her and once she switched it\non for a moment or two directing it Charles thought to see the\ntime by the wrist watch she was wearing then she leant over the\ngate again in the same attitude of expectant interest.",
    "Suddenly\nCharles heard a low whistle twice repeated.",
    "He saw the girl start to sudden attention.",
    "She leant farther over the\ngate and from her lips came the same signal  a low whistle twice\nrepeated.",
    "Then with startling suddenness a mans figure loomed out of the\nnight.",
    "A low exclamation came from the girl.",
    "She moved back a\npace or two the gate swung inward and the man joined her.",
    "She\nspoke to him in a low hurried voice.",
    "Unable to catch what they said\nCharles moved forward somewhat imprudently.",
    "A twig snapped\nbeneath his feet.",
    "The man swung round instantly.",
    "Whats that he said.",
    "He caught sight of Charless retreating figure.",
    "Hie you stop What are you doing here\n\nWith a bound he sprang after Charles.",
    "Charles turned and tackled\nhim adroitly.",
    "The next moment they were rolling over and over\ntogether locked in a tight embrace.",
    "The tussle was a short one.",
    "Charless assailant was by far the\nheavier and stronger of the two.",
    "He rose to his feet jerking his\ncaptive with him.",
    "Switch on that light Violet he said lets have a look at this\nfellow.",
    "The girl who had been standing terrified a few paces away came\nforward and switched on the torch obediently.",
    "It must be the man who is staying in the village she said.",
    "A\njournalist.",
    "A journalist eh exclaimed the other.",
    "I dont like the breed.",
    "What\nare you doing you skunk nosing round private grounds at this time\nof night\n\nThe torch wavered in Violets hand.",
    "For the first time Charles was\ngiven a full view of his antagonist.",
    "For a few minutes he had\nentertained the wild idea that the visitor might have been the\nescaped convict.",
    "One look at the other dispelled any such fancy.",
    "This was a young man not more than twentyfour or five years of\nage.",
    "Tall goodlooking and determined with none of the hunted\ncriminal about him.",
    "Now then he said sharply Whats your name\n\nMy name is Charles Enderby said Charles.",
    "You havent told me\nyours he continued.",
    "Confound your cheek\n\nA sudden flash of inspiration came to Charles.",
    "An inspired guess\nhad saved him more than once.",
    "It was a long shot but he believed\nthat he was right.",
    "I think however he said quietly that I can guess it.",
    "Eh\n\n\fThe other was clearly taken aback.",
    "I think said Charles that I have the pleasure of addressing Mr\nBrian Pearson from Australia.",
    "Is that so\n\nThere was a silence  rather a long silence.",
    "Charles had a feeling\nthat the tables were turned.",
    "How the devil you knew that I cant think said the other at last\nbut youre right.",
    "My name is Brian Pearson.",
    "In that case said Charles supposing we adjourn to the house\nand talk things over\n\nChapter 23\n\nAT HAZELMOOR\n\nMajor Burnaby was doing his accounts or  to use a more Dickenslike phrase he was looking into his affairs.",
    "The Major was an\nextremely methodical man.",
    "In a calfbound book he kept a record of\nshares bought shares sold and the accompanying loss or profit usually a loss for in common with most retired army men the Major\nwas attracted by a high rate of interest rather than a modest\npercentage coupled with safety.",
    "These oil wells looked all right he was muttering.",
    "Seems as\nthough there ought to have been a fortune in it.",
    "Almost as bad as\nthat diamond mine Canadian land that ought to be sound now.",
    "His cogitations were interrupted as the head of Mr Ronald Garfield\nappeared at the open window.",
    "Hello said Ronnie cheerfully I hope Im not butting in\n\nIf you are coming in go round to the front door said Major\nBurnaby.",
    "Mind the rock plants.",
    "I believe you are standing on them\nat the moment.",
    "Ronnie retreated with an apology and presently presented himself\nat the front door.",
    "Wipe your feet on the mat if you dont mind cried the Major.",
    "He found young men extremely trying.",
    "Indeed the only young man\ntowards whom he had felt any kindliness for a long time was the\njournalist Charles Enderby.",
    "A nice young chap the Major had said to himself.",
    "And very\ninterested too in what I have told him about the Boer War.",
    "Towards Ronnie Garfield the Major felt no such kindliness.",
    "Practically everything that the unfortunate Ronnie said or did\nmanaged to rub the Major up the wrong way.",
    "Still hospitality is\nhospitality.",
    "Have a drink said the Major loyal to that tradition.",
    "No thanks.",
    "As a matter of fact I just dropped in to see if we couldnt\nget together.",
    "I wanted to go to Exhampton today and I hear Elmer is\nbooked to take you in.",
    "Burnaby nodded.",
    "Got to go over Trevelyans things he explained.",
    "The police have\ndone with the place now.",
    "Well you see said Ronnie rather awkwardly I particularly\nwanted to go into Exhampton today.",
    "I thought if we could get\ntogether and share and share alike as it were.",
    "Eh What about it\n\nCertainly said the Major.",
    "I am agreeable.",
    "Do you a lot more good\nto walk he added.",
    "Exercise.",
    "None of you young chaps nowadays\ntake any exercise.",
    "A brisk six miles there and a brisk six miles back\nwould do you all the good in the world.",
    "If it werent that I needed the\ncar to bring some of Trevelyans things back here I should be\nwalking myself.",
    "Getting soft  thats the curse of the present day.",
    "Oh well said Ronnie I dont believe in being strenuous myself.",
    "But Im glad weve settled that all right.",
    "Elmer said you were\nstarting at eleven oclock.",
    "Is that right\n\nThats it.",
    "Good.",
    "Ill be there.",
    "Ronnie was not quite so good as his word his idea of being on the\nspot was to be ten minutes late and he found Major Burnaby fuming\nand fretting and not at all inclined to be placated by a careless\napology.",
    "What a fuss old buffers make thought Ronnie to himself.",
    "They\nhave no idea what a curse they are to everybody with their\npunctuality and everything done on the dot of the minute and their\ncursed exercise and keeping fit.",
    "His mind played agreeably for a few minutes with the idea of a\nmarriage between Major Burnaby and his aunt.",
    "Which he\nwondered would get the better of it He thought his aunt every\ntime.",
    "Rather amusing to think of her clapping her hands and\nuttering piercing cries to summon the Major to her side.",
    "Banishing these reflections from his mind he proceeded to enter\ninto cheerful conversation.",
    "Sittaford has become a pretty gay spot  what Miss Trefusis and\nthis chap Enderby and the lad from Australia  by the way when did\nhe blow in There he was as large as life this morning and nobody\nknew where he had come from.",
    "Its been worrying my aunt blue in\nthe face.",
    "He is staying with the Willetts said Major Burnaby tartly.",
    "Yes but where did he blow in from Even the Willetts havent got a\nprivate aerodrome.",
    "You know I think theres something deuced\nmysterious about this lad Pearson.",
    "Hes got what I call a nasty\n\n\fgleam in his eye  a very nasty glint.",
    "Its my impression that hes the\nchap who did in poor old Trevelyan.",
    "The Major made no reply.",
    "The way I look at it is this continued Ronnie fellows that go off\nto the Colonies are usually bad hats.",
    "Their relations dont like them\nand push them out there for that reason.",
    "Very well then  there you\nare.",
    "The bad hat comes back short of money visits wealthy uncle\nin the neighborhood of Christmas time wealthy relative wont\ncough up to impecunious nephew  and impecunious nephew bats\nhim one.",
    "Thats what I call a theory.",
    "You should mention it to the police said Major Burnaby.",
    "I thought you might do that said Mr Garfield.",
    "Youre Narracotts\nlittle pal arent you By the way he hasnt been nosing about\nSittaford again has he\n\nNot that I know about.",
    "Not meeting you at the house today is he\n\nNo.",
    "The shortness of the Majors answers seemed to strike Ronnie at\nlast.",
    "Well he said vaguely thats that and relapsed into a thoughtful\nsilence.",
    "At Exhampton the car drew up outside the Three Crowns.",
    "Ronnie\nalighted and after arranging with the Major that they would\nrendezvous there at half past four for the return journey he strode\noff in the direction of such shops as Exhampton offered.",
    "The Major went first to see Mr Kirkwood after a brief conversation\nwith him he took the keys and started off for Hazelmoor.",
    "He had told Evans to meet him there at twelve oclock and he found\nthe faithful retainer waiting on the doorstep.",
    "With a rather grim\nface Major Burnaby inserted the key into the front door and passed\ninto the empty house Evans at his heels.",
    "He had not been in it since\nthe night of the tragedy and in spite of his iron determination to\nshow no weakness he gave a slight shiver as he passed the\ndrawingroom.",
    "Evans and the Major worked together in sympathy and silence.",
    "When either of them made a brief remark it was duly appreciated\nand understood by the other.",
    "Unpleasant job this but it has to be done said Major Burnaby and\nEvans sorting out socks into neat piles and counting pajamas\nresponded.",
    "It seems rather unnatural like but as you say sir its got to be\ndone.",
    "Evans was deft and efficient at his work.",
    "Everything was neatly\nsorted and arranged and classified in heaps.",
    "At one oclock they\n\n\frepaired to the Three Crowns for a short midday meal When they\nreturned to the house the Major suddenly caught Evans by the arm\nas the latter closed the front door behind him.",
    "Hush he said.",
    "Do you hear that footstep overhead Its  its in\nJoes bedroom.",
    "My Gawd sir.",
    "So it is.",
    "A kind of superstitious terror held them both for a minute and then\nbreaking loose from it and with an angry squaring of the shoulders\nthe Major strode to the foot of the stairs and shouted in a stentorian\nvoice\n\nWhos that Come out of there I say.",
    "To his intense surprise and annoyance and yet be it confessed to\nhis slight relief Ronnie Garfield appeared at the top of the stairs.",
    "He looked embarrassed and sheepish.",
    "Hello he said.",
    "I have been looking for you.",
    "What do you mean\nlooking for me\n\nWell I wanted to tell you that I shant be ready at half past four.",
    "Ive\ngot to go into Exeter.",
    "So dont wait for me.",
    "Ill have to get a car up\nfrom Exhampton.",
    "How did you get into this house asked the Major.",
    "The door was open exclaimed Ronnie.",
    "Naturally I thought you\nwere here.",
    "The Major turned to Evans sharply.",
    "Didnt you lock it when you came out\n\nNo sir I hadnt got the key.",
    "Stupid of me muttered the Major.",
    "You dont mind do you said Ronnie.",
    "I couldnt see anyone\ndownstairs so I went upstairs and had a look round.",
    "Of course it doesnt matter snapped the Major.",
    "You startled me\nthats all.",
    "Well said Ronnie airily.",
    "I shall be pushing along now.",
    "So long.",
    "The Major grunted.",
    "Ronnie came down the stairs.",
    "I say he said boyishly do you mind telling me  er  er  where it\nhappened\n\nThe Major jerked a thumb in the direction of the drawingroom.",
    "Oh may I look inside\n\nIf you like growled the Major.",
    "Ronnie opened the drawingroom door.",
    "He was absent a few\nminutes and then returned.",
    "The Major had gone up the stairs but Evans was in the hall.",
    "He had\nthe air of a bulldog on guard his small deepset eyes watched\nRonnie with a somewhat malicious scrutiny.",
    "I say said Ronnie.",
    "I thought you could never wash out blood\nstains.",
    "I thought however much you washed them they always\ncame back.",
    "Oh of course  the old fellow was sandbagged wasnt\nhe Stupid of me.",
    "It was one of these wasnt it He took up a long\nnarrow bolster that lay against one of the other doors.",
    "He weighed\nit thoughtfully and balanced it in his hand.",
    "Nice little toy eh He\nmade a few tentative swings with it in the air.",
    "Evans was silent.",
    "Well said Ronnie realizing that the silence was not a wholly\nappreciative one Id better be getting along.",
    "Im afraid Ive been a\nbit tactless eh He jerked his head towards the upper story.",
    "I\nforgot about them being such pals and all that.",
    "Two of a kind\nwerent they Well Im really going now.",
    "Sorry if Ive said all the\nwrong things.",
    "He walked across the hall and out through the front door.",
    "Evans\nstayed impassively in the hall and only when he had heard the latch\nof the gate close behind Mr Garfield did he mount the stairs and\nrejoin Major Burnaby.",
    "Without any word or comment he resumed\nwhere he had left off going straight across the room and kneeling\ndown in front of the boot cupboard.",
    "At half past three their task was finished.",
    "One trunk of clothes and\nunderclothes was allotted to Evans and another was strapped up\nready to be sent to the Seamens Orphanage.",
    "Papers and bills were\npacked into an attach\u0439 case and Evans was given instructions to\nsee a local firm of removers about the storage of the various\nsporting trophies and heads as there was no room for them in\nMajor Burnabys cottage.",
    "Since Hazelmoor was only rented\nfurnished no other questions arose.",
    "When all this was settled Evans cleared his throat nervously once\nor twice and then said\n\nBeg pardon sir but  Ill be wanting a job to look after a\ngentleman same as I did to look after the Capting.",
    "Yes yes you can tell anyone to apply to me for a recommendation.",
    "That will be quite all right.",
    "Begging your pardon sir that wasnt quite what I meant.",
    "Rebecca\nand me sir weve talked it over and we was wondering if sir  if\nmaybe you would give us a trial\n\nOh but  well  I look after myself as you know.",
    "That old whats her\nname comes in and cleans for me once a day and cooks a few\nthings.",
    "Thats  er  about all I can afford.",
    "It isnt the money that matters so much sir said Evans quickly.",
    "You see sir I was very fond of the Capting and  well if I could do\n\n\ffor you sir the same as I did for him well it would be almost like\nthe same thing if you know what I mean.",
    "The Major cleared his throat and averted his eyes.",
    "Very decent of you upon my word.",
    "Ill  Ill think about it.",
    "And\nescaping with alacrity he almost bolted down the road.",
    "Evans stood\nlooking after him an understanding smile upon his face.",
    "Like as two peas him and the Capting he murmured.",
    "And then a\npuzzled expression came over his face.",
    "Where can they have got to he murmured.",
    "Its a bit queer that.",
    "I\nmust ask Rebecca what she thinks.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nINSPECTOR NARRACOTT DISCUSSES THE CASE\n\nI am not entirely happy about it sir said Inspector Narracott.",
    "The Chief Constable looked at him inquiringly.",
    "No said Inspector Narracott.",
    "Im not nearly as happy about it as\nI was.",
    "You dont think weve got the right man\n\n\fIm not satisfied.",
    "You see to start with everything pointed the one\nway but now  its different.",
    "The evidence against Pearson remains the same.",
    "Yes but theres a good deal of further evidence come to light sir.",
    "Theres the other Pearson  Brian.",
    "Feeling that we had no further to\nlook I accepted the statement that he was in Australia.",
    "Now it turns\nout that he was in England all the time.",
    "It seems he arrived back in\nEngland two months ago  traveled on the same boat as these\nWilletts apparently.",
    "Looks as though he had got sweet on the girl on\nthe voyage.",
    "Anyway for whatever reason he didnt communicate\nwith any of his family.",
    "Neither his sister nor his brother had any idea\nhe was in England.",
    "On Thursday of last week he left the Ormsby\nHotel in Russell Square and drove to Paddington from there until\nTuesday night when Enderby ran across him he refuses to\naccount for his movements in any way.",
    "You pointed out to him the gravity of such a course of action\n\nSaid he didnt give a damn.",
    "He had had nothing to do with the\nmurder and it was up to us to prove he had.",
    "The way he had\nemployed his time was his own business and none of ours and he\ndeclined definitely to state where he had been and what he had\nbeen doing.",
    "Most extraordinary said the Chief Constable.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Its an extraordinary case.",
    "You see theres no use getting\naway from the facts this mans far more the type than the other.",
    "Theres something incongruous about James Pearson hitting an old\nman on the head with a sandbag  but in a manner of speaking it\nmight be all in the days work to Brian Pearson.",
    "Hes a hottempered highhanded young man  and he profits to exactly the\nsame extent remember.",
    "Yes  he came over with Mr Enderby this\nmorning very bright and breezy quite square and aboveboard\nthat was his attitude.",
    "But it wont wash sir it wont wash.\n\nHm  you mean \n\nIt isnt borne out by the facts.",
    "Why didnt he come forward before\nHis uncles death was in all the papers Saturday.",
    "His brother was\narrested Monday.",
    "And he doesnt give a sign of life.",
    "And he wouldnt\nhave either if that journalist hadnt run across him in the garden of\nSittaford House at midnight last night.",
    "What was he doing there Enderby I mean\n\nYou know what journalists are said Narracott always nosing\nround.",
    "Theyre uncanny.",
    "They are a darned nuisance very often said the Chief Constable.",
    "Though they have their uses too.",
    "I fancy it was the young lady put him up to it said Narracott.",
    "The young lady\n\nMiss Emily Trefusis.",
    "How did she know anything about it\n\nShe was up at Sittaford nosing around.",
    "And shes what youd call a\nsharp young lady.",
    "Theres not much gets past her.",
    "What was Brian Pearsons own account of his movements\n\nSaid he came to Sittaford House to see his young lady Miss\nWillett that is.",
    "She came out of the house to meet him when\neveryone was asleep because she didnt want her mother to know\nabout it.",
    "Thats their story.",
    "Inspector Narracotts voice expressed distinct disbelief.",
    "Its my belief sir that if Enderby hadnt run him to earth he never\nwould have come forward.",
    "Hed have gone back to Australia and\nclaimed his inheritance from there.",
    "A taint smile crossed the Chief Constables lips.",
    "How he must have cursed these pestilential prying journalists he\nmurmured.",
    "Theres something else come to light continued the Inspector.",
    "There are three Pearsons you remember and Sylvia Pearson is\nmarried to Martin Dering the novelist.",
    "He told me that he lunched\nand spent the afternoon with an American publisher and went to a\nliterary dinner in the evening but it now seems that he wasnt at\nthat dinner at all.",
    "Who says so\n\nEnderby again.",
    "I think I must meet Enderby said the Chief Constable.",
    "He\nappears to be one of the live wires of this investigation.",
    "No doubt\nabout it the Daily Wire does have some bright young men on their\nstaff.",
    "Well of course that may mean little or nothing continued the\nInspector.",
    "Captain Trevelyan was killed before six oclock so\nwhere Dering spent his evening is really of no consequence  but\nwhy should he have deliberately lied about it I dont like it sir.",
    "No agreed the Chief Constable.",
    "It seems a little unnecessary.",
    "It makes one think that the whole thing may be false.",
    "Its a farfetched supposition I suppose but Dering might have left\nPaddington by the twelve ten train  arrived at Exhampton some\ntime after five have killed the old man got the six ten train and\nbeen back home again before midnight.",
    "At any rate its got to be\nlooked into sir.",
    "Weve got to investigate his financial position see if\nhe was desperately hard up.",
    "Any money his wife came into he\nwould have the handling of  youve only got to look at her to know\nthat.",
    "Weve got to make perfectly sure that the afternoon alibi holds\nwater.",
    "The\n\nwhole\n\nthing\n\nis\n\nextraordinary\n\ncommented\n\nthe\n\nChief\n\nConstable.",
    "But I still think the evidence against Pearson is pretty\n\n\fconclusive.",
    "I see that you dont agree with me  youve a feeling\nyouve got hold of the wrong man.",
    "The\n\nevidence\n\nis\n\nall\n\nright\n\nadmitted\n\nInspector\n\nNarracott\n\ncircumstantial and all that and any jury ought to convict on it.",
    "Still\nwhat you say is true enough  I dont see him as a murderer.",
    "And his young lady is very active in the case said the Chief\nConstable.",
    "Miss Trefusis yes shes a one and no mistake.",
    "A real fine young\nlady.",
    "And absolutely determined to get him off.",
    "Shes got hold of\nthat journalist Enderby and shes working him for all shes worth.",
    "Shes a great deal too good for Mr James Pearson.",
    "Beyond his good\nlooks I wouldnt say there was much to him in the way of\ncharacter.",
    "But if shes a managing young woman thats what she likes said\nthe Chief Constable.",
    "Ah well said Inspector Narracott theres no accounting for\ntastes.",
    "Well you agree sir that I had better take up this alibi of\nDerings without any more delay.",
    "Yes get on to it at once.",
    "What about the fourth interested party in\nthe will Theres a fourth isnt there\n\nYes the sister.",
    "Thats perfectly all right.",
    "I have made inquiries\nthere.",
    "She was at home at six oclock all right sir.",
    "Ill get right on\nwith the Dering business.",
    "It was about five hours later that Inspector Narracott found himself\nonce more in the small sittingroom of The Nook.",
    "This time Mr\nDering was at home.",
    "He couldnt be disturbed as he was writing\nthe maid had said at first but the Inspector had produced an\nofficial card and bade her take it to her master without delay.",
    "Whilst\nwaiting he strode up and down the room.",
    "His mind was working\nactively.",
    "Every now and then he picked up a small object from a\ntable looked at it almost unseeingly and then replaced it.",
    "The\ncigarette box of Australian fiddleback  a present from Brian\nPearson possibly.",
    "He picked up a rather battered old book.",
    "Pride\nand Prejudice.",
    "He opened the cover and saw scrawled on the flyleaf in rather faded ink the name Martha Rycroft.",
    "Somehow the\nname of Rycroft seemed familiar but he could not for the moment\nremember why.",
    "He was interrupted as the door opened and Martin\nDering came into the room.",
    "The novelist was a man of middle height with thick rather heavy\nchestnut hair.",
    "He was goodlooking in a somewhat heavy fashion\nwith lips that were rather full and red.",
    "Inspector Narracott was not prepossessed by his appearance.",
    "Good morning Mr Dering.",
    "Sorry to trouble you all here again.",
    "Oh it doesnt matter Inspector but really I cant tell you any more\nthan youve been told already.",
    "We were led to understand that your brotherinlaw Mr Brian\nPearson was in Australia.",
    "Now we find that he has been in England\n\n\ffor the last two months.",
    "I might have been given an inkling of that I\nthink.",
    "Your wife distinctly told me that he was in New South Wales.",
    "Brian in England Dering seemed genuinely astonished.",
    "I can\nassure you Inspector that I had no knowledge of the fact  nor Im\nsure had my wife.",
    "He has not communicated with you in any way\n\nNo indeed I know for a fact that Sylvia has twice written him\nletters to Australia during that time.",
    "Oh well in that case I apologize sir.",
    "But naturally I thought he\nwould have communicated with his relations and I was a bit sore\nwith you for holding out on me.",
    "Well as I tell you we knew nothing.",
    "Have a cigarette Inspector\nBy the way I see youve recaptured your escaped convict.",
    "Yes got him late Tuesday night.",
    "Rather bad luck for him the mist\ncoming down.",
    "He walked right round in a circle.",
    "Did about twenty\nmiles to find himself about half a mile from Princetown at the end of\nit.",
    "Extraordinary how everyone goes round in circles in a fog.",
    "Good\nthing he didnt escape on the Friday.",
    "I suppose he would have had\nthis murder put down to him as a certainty.",
    "Hes a dangerous man.",
    "Freemantle Freddy they used to call him.",
    "Robbery with violence assault  led the most extraordinary double\n\n\flife.",
    "Half the time he passed as an educated respectable wealthy\nman.",
    "I am not at all sure myself that Broadmoor wasnt the place for\nhim.",
    "A kind of criminal mania used to come over him from time to\ntime.",
    "He would disappear and consort with the lowest characters.",
    "I suppose many people dont escape from Princetown\n\nIts wellnigh impossible sir.",
    "But this particular escape was\nextraordinarily well planned and carried out.",
    "We havent nearly got\nto the bottom of it yet.",
    "Well Dering rose and glanced at his watch if theres nothing\nmore Inspector  Im afraid I am rather a busy man \n\nOh but there is something more Mr Dering.",
    "I want to know why\nyou told me that you were at a literary dinner at the Cecil Hotel on\nFriday night\n\nI  I dont understand you Inspector.",
    "I think you do sir.",
    "You werent at that dinner Mr Dering.",
    "Martin Dering hesitated.",
    "His eyes ran uncertainly from the\nInspectors face up to the ceiling then to the door and then to his\nfeet.",
    "The Inspector waited calm and stolid.",
    "Well said Martin Dering at last supposing I wasnt.",
    "What the hell\nhas that got to do with you What have my movements five hours\nafter my uncle was murdered got to do with you or anyone else\n\nYou made a certain statement to us Mr Dering and I want that\nstatement verified.",
    "Part of it has already proved to be untrue.",
    "Ive\ngot to check up on the other half.",
    "You say you lunched and spent\nthe afternoon with a friend.",
    "Yes  my American publisher.",
    "His name\n\nRosenkraun Edgar Rosenkraun.",
    "Ah and his address\n\nHes left England.",
    "He left last Saturday.",
    "For New York\n\nYes.",
    "Then hell be on the sea at the present moment.",
    "What boat is he\non\n\nI  I really cant remember.",
    "You know the line Was it a Cunard or White Star\n\n\fI  I really dont remember.",
    "Ah well said the Inspector well cable his firm in New York.",
    "Theyll know.",
    "It was the Gargantua said Dering sullenly.",
    "Thank you Mr Dering I thought you could remember if you tried\nNow your statement is that you lunched with Mr Rosenkraun and\nthat you spent the afternoon with him.",
    "At what time did you leave\nhim\n\nAbout five oclock I should say.",
    "And then\n\nI decline to state.",
    "Its no business of yours.",
    "Thats all you want\nsurely.",
    "Inspector Narracott nodded thoughtfully.",
    "If Rosenkraun confirmed\nDerings statement then any case against Dering must fall to the\nground.",
    "Whatever his mysterious activities had been that evening\ncould not affect the case.",
    "What are you going to do demanded Dering uneasily.",
    "Wireless Mr Rosenkraun on board the Gargantua.",
    "Damn it all cried Dering youll involve me in all sorts of publicity.",
    "Look here \n\n\fHe went across to his desk scribbled a few words on a bit of paper\nthen took it to the Inspector.",
    "I suppose youve got to do what youre doing he said\nungraciously but at least you might do it in my way.",
    "Its not fair to\nrun a chap in for a lot of trouble.",
    "On the sheet of paper was written\n\nRosenkraun S.S. Gargantua.",
    "Please confirm my statement I was with you lunchtime until five\noclock Friday 14th.",
    "Martin Dering.",
    "Have the reply sent straight to you  I dont mind.",
    "But dont have it\nsent to Scotland Yard or a Police Station.",
    "You dont know what\nthese Americans are like.",
    "Any hint of me being mixed up in a police\ncase and this new contract that Ive been discussing will go to the\nwinds.",
    "Keep it a private matter Inspector.",
    "Ive no objection to that Mr Dering.",
    "All I want is the truth.",
    "Ill send\nthis reply paid the reply to be sent to my private address in\nExeter.",
    "Thank you you are a good chap.",
    "Its not such easy going earning\nyour living by literature Inspector.",
    "Youll see the answer will be all\nright.",
    "I did tell you a lie about the dinner but as a matter of fact I\nhad told my wife that that was where I had been and I thought I\nmight as well stick to the same story to you.",
    "Otherwise I would have\nlet myself in for a lot of trouble.",
    "If Mr Rosenkraun confirms your statement Mr Dering you will\nhave nothing else to fear.",
    "An unpleasant character the Inspector thought as he left the\nhouse.",
    "But he seems pretty certain that this American publisher\nwill confirm the truth of his story.",
    "A sudden remembrance came to the Inspector as he hopped into\nthe train which would take him back to Devon.",
    "Rycroft he said of course  thats the name of the old gentleman\nwho lives in one of the cottages at Sittaford.",
    "A curious\ncoincidence.",
    "Chapter 25\n\nAT DELLERS CAF\u0419\n\nEmily Trefusis and Charles Enderby were seated at a small table in\nDellers Caf\u0439 in Exeter.",
    "It was half past three and at that hour there\n\n\fwas comparative peace and quiet.",
    "A few people were having a\nquiet cup of tea but the restaurant on the whole was deserted.",
    "Well said Charles what do you think of him\n\nEmily frowned.",
    "Its difficult she said.",
    "After his interview with the police Brian Pearson had lunched with\nthem.",
    "He had been extremely polite to Emily rather too polite in her\nopinion.",
    "To that astute girl it seemed a shade unnatural.",
    "Here was a young\nman conducting a clandestine love affair and an officious stranger\nbutts in.",
    "Brian Pearson had taken it like a lamb had fallen in with Charless\nsuggestion of having a car and driving over to see the police.",
    "Why this attitude of meek acquiescence It seemed to Emily\nentirely untypical of the natural Brian Pearson as she read his\ncharacter.",
    "Ill see you in hell first would she felt sure have been far more\nhis attitude.",
    "This lamblike demeanor was suspicious.",
    "She tried to convey\nsomething of her feelings to Enderby.",
    "I get you said Enderby.",
    "Our Brian has got something to conceal\ntherefore he cant be his natural highhanded self.",
    "Thats it exactly.",
    "Do you think he might possibly have killed old Trevelyan\n\nBrian said Emily thoughtfully is  well a person to be reckoned\nwith.",
    "He is rather unscrupulous I should think and if he wanted\nanything I dont think he would let ordinary conventional standards\nstand in his way.",
    "Hes not plain tame English.",
    "Putting all personal considerations on one side hes a more likely\nstarter than Jim said Enderby.",
    "Emily nodded.",
    "Much more likely.",
    "He would carry a thing through well  because\nhe would never lose his nerve.",
    "Honestly Emily do you think he did it\n\nI  I dont know.",
    "He fulfills the conditions  the only person who\ndoes.",
    "What do you mean by fulfills the conditions\n\nWell 1 Motive.",
    "She ticked off the items on her fingers.",
    "The same\nmotive.",
    "Twenty thousand pounds.",
    "2 Opportunity.",
    "Nobody knows\nwhere he was on Friday afternoon and if he was anywhere that he\n\n\fcould say  well  surely he would say it So we assume that he was\nactually in the neighborhood of Hazelmoor on Friday.",
    "They havent found anyone who save him in Exhampton Charles\npointed out and hes a fairly noticeable person.",
    "Emily shook her head scornfully.",
    "He wasnt in Exhampton.",
    "Dont you see Charles if he committed\nthe murder he planned it beforehand.",
    "Its only poor innocent Jim\nwho came down like a mug and stayed there.",
    "Theres Lydford and\nChagford or perhaps Exeter.",
    "He might have walked over from\nLydford  thats a main road and the snow wouldnt have been\nimpassable.",
    "It would have been pretty good going.",
    "I suppose we ought to make inquiries all round.",
    "The police are doing that said Emily and theyll do it a lot better\nthan we shall.",
    "All public things are much better done by the police.",
    "Its private and personal things like listening to Mrs Curtis and\npicking up a hint from Miss Percehouse and watching the Willetts thats where we score.",
    "Or dont as the case may be said Charles.",
    "To go back to Brian Pearson fulfilling the conditions said Emily.",
    "Weve done two motive and opportunity and theres the third  the\none that in a way I think is the most important of all.",
    "Whats that\n\n\fWell I have felt from the beginning that we couldnt ignore that\nqueer business of the table turning.",
    "I have tried to look at it as\nlogically and clearsightedly as possible.",
    "There are just three\nsolutions of it.",
    "1 That it was supernatural.",
    "Well of course that\nmay be so but personally I am ruling it out.",
    "2 That it was\ndeliberate  someone did it on purpose but as one cant arrive at\nany conceivable reason we can rule that out also.",
    "3 Accidental.",
    "Someone gave himself away without meaning to do so  indeed\nquite against his will.",
    "An unconscious piece of selfrevelation.",
    "If so\nsomeone among those six people either knew definitely that\nCaptain Trevelyan was going to be killed at a certain time that\nafternoon or that someone was having an interview with him from\nwhich violence might result.",
    "None of those six people could have\nbeen the actual murderer but one of them must have been in\ncollusion with the murderer.",
    "Theres no link between Major Burnaby\nand anybody else or Mr Rycroft and anybody else or Ronald\nGarfield and anyone else but when we come to the Willetts its\ndifferent.",
    "Theres a link between Violet Willett and Brian Pearson.",
    "Those two are on very intimate terms and that girl was all on the\njump after the murder.",
    "You think she knew said Charles.",
    "She or her mother  one or other of them.",
    "Theres one person you havent mentioned said Charles.",
    "Mr\nDuke.",
    "I know said Emily.",
    "Its queer.",
    "Hes the one person we know\nabsolutely nothing about.",
    "Ive tried to see him twice and failed.",
    "There seems no connection between him and Captain Trevelyan or\nbetween him and any of Captain Trevelyans relations theres\nabsolutely nothing to connect him with the case in any way and yet\n\n\nWell said Charles Enderby as Emily paused.",
    "And yet we met Inspector Narracott coming out of his cottage.",
    "What does Inspector Narracott know about him that we dont I\nwish I knew.",
    "You think \n\nSupposing Duke is a suspicious character and the police know it.",
    "Supposing Captain Trevelyan had found out something about Duke.",
    "He was particular about his tenants remember and supposing he\nwas going to tell the police what he knew.",
    "And Duke arranges with\nan accomplice to have him killed.",
    "Oh I know it all sounds dreadfully\nmelodramatic put like that and yet after all something of the kind\nmight be possible.",
    "Its an idea certainly said Charles slowly.",
    "They were both silent each one deep in thought.",
    "Suddenly Emily said\n\n\fDo you know that queer feeling you get when somebody is looking\nat you.",
    "I feel now as though someones eyes were burning the back\nof my neck.",
    "Is it all fancy or is there really someone staring at me\nnow\n\nCharles moved his chair an inch or two and looked round the caf\u0439 in\na casual manner.",
    "Theres a woman at a table in the window he reported.",
    "Tall dark\nand handsome.",
    "Shes staring at you.",
    "Young\n\nNo not very young.",
    "Hello\n\nWhat is it\n\nRonnie Garfield.",
    "He has just come in and hes shaking hands with\nher and hes sitting down at her table.",
    "I think shes saying\nsomething about us.",
    "Emily opened her handbag.",
    "Rather ostentatiously she powdered\nher nose adjusting the small pocket mirror to a convenient angle.",
    "Its Aunt Jennifer she said softly.",
    "They are getting up.",
    "They are going said Charles.",
    "Do you want to speak to her\n\nNo said Emily.",
    "I think its better for me to pretend that I havent\nseen her.",
    "After all said Charles why shouldnt Aunt Jennifer know Ronnie\nGarfield and ask him to tea\n\nWhy should she said Emily.",
    "Why shouldnt she\n\nOh for goodness sake Charles dont lets go on and on like this\nshould  shouldnt  should  shouldnt.",
    "Of course its all nonsense\nand it doesnt mean anything But we were just saying that nobody\nelse at the s\u0439ance had any relation with the family and not five\nminutes later we see Ronnie Garfield having tea with Captain\nTrevelyans sister.",
    "It shows said Charles that you never know.",
    "It shows said Emily that you are always having to begin again.",
    "In more ways than one said Charles.",
    "Emily looked at him.",
    "What do you mean\n\nNothing at present said Charles.",
    "He put his hand over hers.",
    "She did not draw it away.",
    "Weve got to put this through said Charles.",
    "Afterwards \n\n\fAfterwards said Emily softly.",
    "Id do anything for you Emily said Charles.",
    "Simply anything \n\nWould you said Emily.",
    "Thats rather nice of you Charles dear.",
    "Chapter 26\n\nROBERT GARDNER\n\nIt was just twenty minutes later when Emily rang the front door bell\nof The Laurels.",
    "It had been a sudden impulse.",
    "She smiled beamingly\non Beatrice when the latter opened the door to her.",
    "Its me again said Emily.",
    "Mrs Gardners out I know but can I\nsee Mr Gardner\n\nSuch a request was clearly unusual.",
    "Beatrice seemed doubtful.",
    "Well I dont know.",
    "Ill go up and see shall I\n\nYes do said Emily.",
    "Beatrice went upstairs leaving Emily alone in the hall.",
    "She returned\nin a few minutes to ask the young lady to please step this way.",
    "Robert Gardner was lying on a couch by the window in a big room\non the first floor.",
    "He was a big man blue eyed and fair haired.",
    "He\nlooked Emily thought as Tristran ought to look in the third act of\nTristran and Isolde and as no Wagnerian tenor has ever looked yet.",
    "Hello he said.",
    "You are the criminals spouse to be arent you\n\nThats right Uncle Robert said Emily.",
    "I suppose I do call you\nUncle Robert dont I she asked.",
    "If Jennifer will allow it.",
    "Whats it like having a young man\nlanguishing in prison\n\nA cruel man Emily decided.",
    "A man who would take a malicious joy\nin giving you sharp digs in painful places.",
    "But she was a match for him.",
    "She said smilingly\n\nVery thrilling.",
    "Not so thrilling for Master Jim eh\n\nOh well said Emily its an experience isnt it\n\nTeach him life cant be all beer and skittles said Robert Gardner\nmaliciously.",
    "Too young to fight in the Great War wasnt he Able to\nlive soft and take it easily.",
    "Well well...",
    "He got it in the neck from\nanother source.",
    "He looked at her curiously.",
    "What did you want to come and see me for eh\n\nThere was a tinge of something like suspicion in his voice.",
    "If you are going to marry into a family its just as well to see all your\nrelationsinlaw beforehand.",
    "Know the worst before its too late.",
    "So you really think you are\ngoing to marry young Jim eh\n\nWhy not\n\nIn spite of this murder charge\n\nIn spite of this murder charge.",
    "Well said Robert Gardner I have never seen anybody less cast\ndown.",
    "Anyone would think you were enjoying yourself.",
    "I am.",
    "Tracking down a murderer is frightfully thrilling.",
    "Eh\n\nI said tracking down a murderer is frightfully thrilling said Emily.",
    "Robert Gardner stared at her then he threw himself back on his\npillows.",
    "I am tired he said in a fretful voice.",
    "I cant talk any more.",
    "Nurse\nwheres Nurse Nurse Im tired.",
    "Nurse Davis had come swiftly at his call from an adjoining room.",
    "Mr Gardner gets tired very easily.",
    "I think you had better go now if\nyou dont mind Miss Trefusis.",
    "Emily rose to her feet.",
    "She nodded brightly and said\n\nGoodby Uncle Robert.",
    "Perhaps Ill come back some day.",
    "What do you mean\n\nAu revoir said Emily.",
    "She was going out of the front door when she stopped.",
    "Oh she said to Beatrice.",
    "I have left my gloves.",
    "I will get them Miss.",
    "Oh no said Emily.",
    "Ill do it.",
    "She ran lightly up the stairs and\nentered without knocking.",
    "Oh said Emily.",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "I am so sorry.",
    "It was my\ngloves.",
    "She took them up ostentatiously and smiling sweetly at the\ntwo occupants of the room who were sitting hand in hand ran down\nthe stairs and out of the house.",
    "This glove leaving is a terrific scheme said Emily to herself.",
    "This\nis the second time its come off.",
    "Poor Aunt Jennifer does she know\nI wonder Probably not.",
    "I must hurry or Ill keep Charles waiting.",
    "Enderby was waiting in Elmers Ford at the agreed rendezvous.",
    "Any luck he asked as he tucked the rug round her.",
    "In a way yes.",
    "Im not sure.",
    "Enderby looked at her inquiringly.",
    "No said Emily in answer to his glance Im not going to tell you\nabout it.",
    "You see it may have nothing whatever to do with it  and if\nso it wouldnt be fair.",
    "Enderby sighed.",
    "I call that hard he observed.",
    "Im sorry said Emily firmly.",
    "But there it is.",
    "Have it your own way said Charles coldly.",
    "They drove on in silence  an offended silence on Charless part  an\noblivious one on Emilys.",
    "They were nearly at Exhampton when she broke the silence by a\ntotally unexpected remark.",
    "Charles she said are you a bridge player\n\nYes I am.",
    "Why\n\nI was thinking.",
    "You know what they tell you to do when youre\nassessing the value of your hand If youre defending  count the\nwinners  but if youre attacking count the losers.",
    "Now were\nattacking in this business of ours  but perhaps we have been doing\nit the wrong way.",
    "How do you mean\n\nWell weve been counting the winners havent we I mean going\nover the people who could have killed Captain Trevelyan however\nimprobable it seems.",
    "And thats perhaps why weve got so terribly\nmuddled.",
    "I havent got muddled said Charles.",
    "Well I have then.",
    "Im so muddled I cant think at all.",
    "Lets look at it\nthe other way round.",
    "Lets count the losers  the people who cant\npossibly have killed Captain Trevelyan.",
    "Well lets see  Enderby reflected.",
    "To begin with theres the\nWilletts and Burnaby and Rycroft and Ronnie  Oh and Duke.",
    "Yes agreed Emily.",
    "We know none of them can have killed him.",
    "Because at the time he was killed they were all at Sittaford House\nand they all saw each other and they cant all be lying.",
    "Yes theyre\nall out of it.",
    "As a matter of fact everyone in Sittaford is out of it said Enderby.",
    "Even Elmer he lowered his voice in deference to the possibility of\nthe driver hearing him.",
    "Because the road to Sittaford was\nimpassable for cars on Friday.",
    "He could have walked said Emily in an equally low voice.",
    "If\nMajor Burnaby could have got there that evening Elmer could have\nstarted at lunch time  got to Exhampton at five murdered him and\nwalked back again.",
    "Enderby shook his head.",
    "I dont think he could have walked back again.",
    "Remember the\nsnow started to fall about half past six.",
    "Anyway youre not accusing\nElmer are you\n\nNo said Emily though of course he might be a homicidal\nmaniac.",
    "Hush said Charles.",
    "Youll hurt his feelings if he hears you.",
    "At any rate said Emily you cant say definitely that he couldnt\nhave murdered Captain Trevelyan.",
    "Almost said Charles.",
    "He couldnt walk to Exhampton and back\nwithout all Sittaford knowing about it and saying it was queer.",
    "It certainly is a place where everyone knows everything agreed\nEmily.",
    "Exactly said Charles and thats why I say that everyone in\nSittaford is out of it.",
    "The only ones that werent at the Willetts  Miss\nPercehouse and Captain Wyatt  are invalids.",
    "They couldnt go\nplowing through snowstorms.",
    "And dear old Curtis and Mrs C. If any\nof them did it they must have gone comfortably to Exhampton for\nthe weekend and come back when it was all over.",
    "Emily laughed.",
    "You couldnt be absent from Sittaford for the weekend without its\nbeing noticed certainly she said.",
    "Curtis would notice the silence if Mrs C. was said Enderby.",
    "Of course said Emily the person it ought to be is Abdul.",
    "It would\nbe in a book.",
    "Hed be a Lascar really and Captain Trevelyan would\nhave thrown his favorite brother overboard in a mutiny  something\nlike that.",
    "I decline to believe said Charles that that wretched depressed\nlooking native ever murdered anybody.",
    "I know he said suddenly.",
    "What said Emily eagerly.",
    "The blacksmiths wife.",
    "The one whos expecting her eighth.",
    "The\nintrepid woman despite her condition walked all the way to\nSittaford and batted him one with the sandbag.",
    "And why pray\n\nBecause of course although the blacksmith was the father of the\npreceding seven Captain Trevelyan was the father of her coming\nchild.",
    "Charles said Emily.",
    "Dont be indelicate.",
    "And anyway she added it would be the blacksmith who did it\nnot her.",
    "A really good case there.",
    "Think how that brawny arm could\nwield a sandbag And his wife would never notice his absence with\nseven children to look after.",
    "She wouldnt have time to notice a\nmere man.",
    "This is degenerating into mere idiocy said Charles.",
    "It is rather agreed Emily.",
    "Counting losers hasnt been a great\nsuccess.",
    "What about you said Charles.",
    "Me\n\nWhere were you when the crime was committed\n\nHow extraordinary I never thought of that.",
    "I was in London of\ncourse.",
    "But I dont know that I could prove it.",
    "I was alone in my flat\n\n\fThere you are said Charles.",
    "Motive and everything.",
    "Your young\nman coming into twenty thousand pounds.",
    "What more do you\nwant\n\nYou are clever Charles said Emily.",
    "I can see that really Im a\nmost suspicious character.",
    "I never thought of it before.",
    "Chapter 27\n\nNARRACOTT ACTS\n\nTwo mornings later Emily was seated in Inspector Narracotts\noffice.",
    "She had come over from Sittaford that morning.",
    "Inspector Narracott looked at her appraisingly.",
    "He admired Emilys\npluck her courageous determination not to give in and her resolute\ncheerfulness.",
    "She was a fighter and Inspector Narracott admired\nfighters.",
    "It was his private opinion that she was a great deal too\ngood for Jim Pearson even if that young man was innocent of the\nmurder.",
    "Its generally understood in books he said that the police are\nintent on having a victim and dont in the least care if that victim is\ninnocent or not as long as they have enough evidence to convict\nhim.",
    "Thats not the truth Miss Trefusis its only the guilty man we\nwant.",
    "Do you honestly believe Jim to be guilty Inspector Narracott\n\n\fI cant give you an official answer to that Miss Trefusis.",
    "But Ill tell\nyou this  that we are examining not only the evidence against him\nbut the evidence against other people very carefully.",
    "You mean against his brother  Brian\n\nA very unsatisfactory gentleman Mr Brian Pearson.",
    "Refused to\nanswer questions or to give any information about himself but I\nthink  Inspector Narracotts slow Devonshire smile widened I\nthink I can make a pretty good guess at some of his activities.",
    "If I\nam right I shall know in another half hour.",
    "Then theres the ladys\nhusband Mr Dering.",
    "Youve seen him asked Emily curiously.",
    "Inspector Narracott looked at her vivid face and felt tempted to\nrelax official caution.",
    "Leaning back in his chair he recounted his\ninterview with Mr Dering then from a file at his elbow he took out a\ncopy of the wireless message he had dispatched to Mr Rosenkraun.",
    "Thats what I sent he said.",
    "And heres the reply.",
    "Emily read it.",
    "Narracott Drysdale Road Exeter.",
    "Certainly confirm Mr Derings statement.",
    "He was in my company all\nFriday afternoon.",
    "Rosenkraun.",
    "Oh  bother said Emily selecting a milder word than that she had\nmeant to use knowing that the police force was oldfashioned and\neasily shocked.",
    "Yees said Inspector Narracott reflectively.",
    "Its annoying isnt\nit\n\nAnd his slow Devonshire smile broke out again.",
    "But I am a suspicious man Miss Trefusis.",
    "Mr Derings reasons\nsounded very plausible  but I thought it a pity to play into his hands\ntoo completely.",
    "So I sent another wireless message.",
    "Again he handed her two pieces of paper.",
    "The first ran\n\nInformation wanted re murder of Captain Trevelyan.",
    "Do you support\nMartin Derings statement of alibi on Friday afternoon.",
    "Divisional Inspector Narracott Exeter.",
    "The return message showed agitation and a reckless disregard for\nexpense.",
    "Had no idea it was criminal case did not see Martin Dering Friday\nagreed support his statement as one friend to another believed his\nwife was having him watched for divorce proceedings.",
    "Oh said Emily.",
    "Oh  you are clever Inspector.",
    "The Inspector evidently thought that he had been rather clever.",
    "His\nsmile was gentle and contented.",
    "How men do stick together went on Emily looking over the\ntelegrams.",
    "Poor Sylvia.",
    "In some ways I really think that men are\nbeasts.",
    "Thats why she added its so nice when one finds a man\non whom one can really rely.",
    "And she smiled admiringly at the Inspector.",
    "Now all this is very confidential Miss Trefusis the Inspector\nwarned her.",
    "I have gone further than I should in letting you know\nabout this.",
    "I think its adorable of you said Emily.",
    "I shall never never forget\nit.",
    "Well mind the Inspector warned her.",
    "Not a word to anybody.",
    "You mean that I am not to tell Charles  Mr. Enderby.",
    "Journalists\n\nwill\n\nbe\n\njournalists\n\nsaid\n\nInspector\n\nNarracott.",
    "However well you have got him tamed Miss Trefusis  well news is\nnews isnt it\n\nI wont tell him then said Emily.",
    "I think Ive got him muzzled all\nright but as you say newspaper men will be newspaper men.",
    "Never part with information unnecessarily.",
    "Thats my rule said\nInspector Narracott.",
    "A faint twinkle appeared in Emilys eyes her unspoken thought\nbeing that Inspector Narracott had infringed this rule rather badly\nduring the last half hour.",
    "A sudden recollection came into her mind not of course that it\nprobably mattered now.",
    "Everything seemed to be pointing in a\ntotally different direction.",
    "But still it would be nice to know.",
    "Inspector Narracott she said suddenly.",
    "Who is Mr Duke\n\nMr Duke\n\nShe thought the Inspector was rather taken aback by her\nquestions.",
    "You remember said Emily we met you coming out of his cottage\nin Sittaford.",
    "Ah yes yes I remember.",
    "To tell you the truth Miss Trefusis I\nthought I would like to have an independent account of that table\nturning business.",
    "Major Burnaby is not a firstrate hand at\ndescription.",
    "And yet said Emily thoughtfully if I had been you I should have\ngone to somebody like Mr Rycroft for it.",
    "Why Mr Duke\n\nThere was a silence and then the Inspector said\n\nJust a matter of opinion.",
    "I wonder.",
    "I wonder if the police know something about Mr Duke.",
    "Inspector Narracott didnt answer.",
    "He had got his eyes fixed very\nsteadily on the blotting paper.",
    "The man who leads a blameless life said Emily.",
    "That seems to\ndescribe Mr Duke awfully accurately but perhaps he hasnt always\nled a blameless life Perhaps the police know that\n\nShe saw a faint quiver on Inspector Narracotts face as he tried to\nconceal a smile.",
    "You like guessing dont you Miss Trefusis he said amiably.",
    "When people dont tell you things you have to guess retaliated\nEmily.",
    "If a man as you say is leading a blameless life Inspector\nNarracott said and if it would be an annoyance and an\ninconvenience for him to have his past life raked up well the police\nare capable of keeping their own counsel.",
    "We have no wish to give\na man away.",
    "I see said Emily but all the same  you went to see him didnt\nyou That looks as though you thought to begin with at any rate\nthat he might have had a hand in it.",
    "I wish  I wish I knew who Mr\nDuke really was And what particular branch of criminology he\nindulged in in the past\n\nShe looked appealingly at Inspector Narracott but the latter\npreserved a wooden face and realizing that on this point she could\nnot hope to move him Emily sighed and took her departure.",
    "When she had gone the Inspector sat staring at the blotting pad a\ntrace of a smile still lingering on his lips.",
    "He rang the bell and one of\nhis underlings entered.",
    "Well demanded Inspector Narracott.",
    "Quite right sir.",
    "But it wasnt the Duchy at Princetown it was the\nhotel at Two Bridges.",
    "Ah The Inspector took the papers the other handed to him.",
    "Well he said.",
    "That settles that all right.",
    "Have you followed up the\nother young chaps movements on Friday\n\n\fHe certainly arrived at Exhampton by the last train but I havent\nfound out yet what time he left London.",
    "Inquiries are being made.",
    "Narracott nodded.",
    "Here is the entry from Somerset House sir.",
    "Narracott unfolded it.",
    "It was the record of a marriage in 1894\nbetween William Martin Dering and Martha Elizabeth Rycroft.",
    "Ah said the Inspector anything else\n\nYes sir.",
    "Mr Brian Pearson sailed from Australia on a Blue Funnel\nBoat the Phidias.",
    "She touched at Cape Town but no passengers of\nthe name of Willett were abroad.",
    "No mother and daughter at all\nfrom South Africa.",
    "There was a Mrs and Miss Evans and a Mrs and\nMiss Johnson from Melbourne  the latter answer the description of\nthe Willetts.",
    "Hm said the Inspector  Johnson.",
    "Probably neither Johnson nor\nWillett is the right name.",
    "I think Ive got them taped out all right.",
    "Anything more\n\nThere was nothing else it seemed.",
    "Well said Narracott I think we have got enough to go on with.",
    "Chapter 28\n\n\fBOOTS\n\nBut my dear young lady said Mr Kirkwood what can you\npossibly expect to find at Hazelmoor.",
    "All Captain Trevelyans\neffects have been removed.",
    "The police have made a thorough\nsearch of the house.",
    "I quite understand your position and your\nanxiety that Mr Pearson shall be  er  cleared if possible.",
    "But what\ncan you do\n\nI dont expect to find anything Emily replied or to notice\nanything that the police have overlooked.",
    "I cant explain to you Mr\nKirkwood I want  I want to get the atmosphere of the place.",
    "Please\nlet me have the key.",
    "Theres no harm in it.",
    "Certainly theres no harm in it said Mr Kirkwood with dignity.",
    "Then please be kind said Emily.",
    "So Mr Kirkwood was kind and handed over the with an indulgent\nsmile.",
    "He did his best to come with her which catastrophe was only\naverted by great tact and firmness on Emilys part.",
    "That morning Emily had received a letter.",
    "It was couched in the\nfollowing terms\n\nDear Miss Trefusis\n\n\fwrote Mrs Belling\n\nYou said as how you would like to hear if anything at all should\nhappen that was in any way out of the common even if not\nimportant and as this is peculiar though not in any way important\nI thought it my duty Miss to let you know at once hoping this will\ncatch you by the last post tonight or by the first post tomorrow.",
    "My\nniece she come round and said it wasnt of any importance but\npeculiar which I agreed with her.",
    "The police said and it was\ngenerally thought that nothing was taken from Captain Trevelyans\nhouse and nothing was in a manner of speaking  nothing that is of\nany value but something there is missing though not noticed at the\ntime being unimportant.",
    "But it seems Miss that a pair of the\nCaptains boots is missing which Evans noticed when he went over\nthe things with Major Burnaby.",
    "Though I dont suppose it is of any\nimportance Miss I thought you would like to know.",
    "It was a pair of\nboots Miss the thick kind you rubs oil into and which the Captain\nwould have worn if he had gone out in the snow but as he didnt go\nout in the snow it doesnt seem to make sense.",
    "But missing they are\nand who took them nobody knows and though I well know its of no\nimportance I felt it my duty to write and hoping this finds you as it\nleaves me at present and hoping you are not worrying too much\nabout the young gentleman I remain Miss Yours truly\n\nMrs J. Belling.",
    "Emily had read and reread this letter.",
    "She had discussed it with\nCharles.",
    "Boots said Charles thoughtfully.",
    "It doesnt seem to make\nsense.",
    "It must mean something Emily pointed out.",
    "I mean  why should\na pair of boots be missing\n\nYou dont think Evans is inventing\n\nWhy should he And after all if people do invent they invent\nsomething sensible.",
    "Not a silly pointless thing like this.",
    "Boots suggests something to do with footprints said Charles\nthoughtfully.",
    "I know.",
    "But footprints dont seem to enter into this case at all.",
    "Perhaps if it hadnt come on to snow again \n\nYes perhaps but even then.",
    "Could he have given them to some tramp suggested Charles\nand then the tramp did him in.",
    "I suppose thats possible said Emily but it doesnt sound very\nlike Captain Trevelyan.",
    "He might perhaps have found a man some\nwork to do or given him a shilling but he wouldnt have pressed his\nbest winter boots on him.",
    "Well I give it up said Charles.",
    "Im not going to give it up said Emily.",
    "By hook or by crook Im\ngoing to get to the bottom of it\n\nAccordingly she came to Exhampton and went first to the Three\nCrowns where Mrs Belling received her with great enthusiasm.",
    "And your young gentleman still in prison Miss Well its a cruel\nshame and none of us dont believe it was him  at least I would like\nto hear them say so when I am about.",
    "So you got my letter Youd\nlike to see Evans Well he lives right round the corner 85 Fore\nStreet it is.",
    "I wish I could come with you but I cant leave the place\nbut you cant mistake it.",
    "Emily did not mistake it.",
    "Evans himself was out but Mrs Evans\nreceived her and invited her in.",
    "Emily sat down and induced Mrs\nEvans to do so also and plunged straight into the matter on hand.",
    "Ive come to talk about what your husband told Mrs Belling.",
    "I mean\nabout a pair of Captain Trevelyans boots being missing.",
    "Its an odd thing to be sure said the girl.",
    "Your husband is quite certain about it\n\nOh yes.",
    "Wore these boots most of the time in winter the Captain\ndid.",
    "Big ones they were and he wore a couple of pairs of socks\ninside them.",
    "Emily nodded.",
    "They cant have gone to be mended or anything like that she\nsuggested.",
    "Not without Evans knowing they couldnt said his wife boastfully.",
    "No I suppose not.",
    "Its queer like said Mrs Evans but I dont suppose it had\nanything to do with the murder do you Miss\n\nIt doesnt seem likely agreed Emily.",
    "Have they found out anything new Miss The girls voice was\neager.",
    "Yes one or two things  nothing very important.",
    "Seeing as that the Inspector from Exeter was here again today I\nthought as though they might.",
    "Inspector Narracott\n\nYes thats the one Miss.",
    "Did he come by my train\n\nNo he came by car.",
    "He went to the Three Crowns first and asked\nabout the young gentlemans luggage.",
    "What young gentlemans luggage\n\nThe gentleman you go about with Miss.",
    "Emily stared.",
    "They asked Tom went on the girl I was passing by just after and\nhe told me about it.",
    "Hes a one for noticing is Tom.",
    "He remembered\nthere were two labels on the young gentlemans luggage one to\nExeter and one to Exhampton.",
    "A sudden smile illuminated Emilys face as she pictured the crime\nbeing committed by Charles in order to provide a scoop for himself.",
    "One could she decided write a gruesome little story on that theme.",
    "But she admired Inspector Narracotts thoroughness in checking\nevery detail to do with anyone however remote their connection\nwith the crime.",
    "He must have left Exeter almost immediately after\nhis interview with her.",
    "A fast car would easily beat the train and in\nany case she had lunched in Exeter.",
    "Where did the Inspector go afterwards she asked.",
    "To Sittaford Miss.",
    "Tom heard him tell the driver.",
    "To Sittaford House\n\nBrian Pearson was she knew still staying at Sittaford House with\nthe Willetts.",
    "No Miss to Mr Dukes.",
    "Duke again.",
    "Emily felt irritated and baffled.",
    "Always Duke  the\nunknown factor.",
    "She ought she felt to be able to deduce him from\nthe evidence but he seemed to have produced the same effect on\neveryone  a normal ordinary pleasant man.",
    "Ive got to see him said Emily to herself.",
    "Ill go straight there as\nsoon as I get back to Sittaford.",
    "Then she had thanked Mrs Evans gone on to Mr Kirkwoods and\nobtained the key and was now standing in the hall of Hazelmoor and\nwondering how and what she had expected to feel there.",
    "She mounted the stairs slowly and went into the first room at the\ntop of the stairs.",
    "This was quite clearly Captain Trevelyans\nbedroom.",
    "It had as Mr Kirkwood had said been emptied of\npersonal effects.",
    "Blankets were folded in a neat pile the drawers\nwere empty there was not so much as a hanger left in the\ncupboard.",
    "The boot cupboard showed a row of bare shelves.",
    "Emily sighed and then turned and went downstairs.",
    "Here was the\nsittingroom where the dead man had lain the snow blowing in from\nthe open window.",
    "She tried to visualize the scene.",
    "Whose hand had struck Captain\nTrevelyan down and why Had he been killed at five and twenty\npast five as everyone believed  or had Jim really lost his nerve and\nlied Had he failed to make anyone hear at the front door and gone\nround to the window looked in and seen his dead uncles body and\n\n\fdashed away in an agony of fear If only she knew.",
    "According to Mr\nDacres Jim stuck to his story.",
    "Yes  but Jim might have lost his\nnerve.",
    "She couldnt be sure.",
    "Had there been as Mr Rycroft had\nsuggested someone else in the house  someone who had\noverheard the quarrel and seized his chance\n\nIf so  did that throw any light on the boot problem Had someone\nbeen upstairs  perhaps in Captain Trevelyans bedroom Emily\npassed through the hall again.",
    "She took a quick look into the diningroom there were a couple of\ntrunks there neatly strapped and labeled.",
    "The sideboard was bare.",
    "The silver cups were at Major Burnabys bungalow.",
    "She noticed however that the prize of three new novels an\naccount of which Charles had had from Evans and had reported\nwith amusing embellishments to her had been forgotten and lay\ndejectedly on a chair.",
    "She looked round the room and shook her head.",
    "There was nothing\nhere.",
    "She went up the stairs again and once more entered the bedroom.",
    "She must know why these boots were missing Until she could\nconcoct some theory reasonably satisfactory to her herself which\nwould account for their disappearance she felt powerless to put\nthem out of her mind.",
    "They were soaring to ridiculous proportions\ndwarfing everything else to do with the case.",
    "Was there nothing to\nhelp her\n\n\fShe took each drawer out and felt behind it.",
    "In detective stories\nthere was always an obliging scrap of paper.",
    "But evidently in real\nlife one could not expect such fortunate accidents or else\nInspector Narracott and his men had been wonderfully thorough.",
    "She felt for loose boards she felt round the edge of the carpet with\nher fingers.",
    "She investigated the spring mattress.",
    "What she\nexpected to find in all these places she hardly knew but she went on\nlooking with dogged perseverance.",
    "And then as she straightened her back and stood upright her eye\nwas caught by the one incongruous touch in this room of apple pie\norder a little pile of soot in the grate.",
    "Emily looked at it with the fascinated gaze of a bird for a snake.",
    "She\ndrew nearer eyeing it.",
    "It was no logical deduction no reasoning of\ncause and effect it was simply that the sight of soot as such\nsuggested a certain possibility.",
    "Emily rolled up her sleeves and thrust both arms up the chimney.",
    "A moment later she was staring with incredulous delight at a parcel\nwrapped\n\nloosely\n\nin\n\nnewspaper.",
    "One\n\nshake\n\ndetached\n\nthe\n\nnewspaper and there before her were The missing pair of boots.",
    "But why said Emily.",
    "Here they are.",
    "But why Why Why Why\n\nShe stared at them.",
    "She turned them over.",
    "She examined them\noutside and inside and the same question beat monotonously in her\nbrain.",
    "Why\n\n\fGranted that someone had removed Captain Trevelyans boots and\nhidden them up the chimney.",
    "Why had they done so\n\nOh cried Emily desperately I shall go mad\n\nShe put the boots carefully in the middle of the floor and drawing up\na chair opposite them she sat down.",
    "And then deliberately she set\nherself to think out things from the beginning going over every\ndetail that she knew herself or had learned by hearsay from other\npeople.",
    "She considered every actor in the drama and outside the\ndrama.",
    "And suddenly a queer nebulous idea began to take shape  an idea\nsuggested by that pair of innocent boots that stood there dumbly on\nthe floor.",
    "But if so said Emily  if so \n\nShe picked up the boots in her hand and hurried downstairs.",
    "She\npushed open the diningroom door and went to the cupboard in the\ncorner.",
    "Here was Captain Trevelyans motley array of sporting\ntrophies and sporting outfits all the things he had not trusted within\nreach of the female tenants.",
    "The skis the sculls the elephants\nfoot the tusks the fishing rods  everything still waiting for Messrs.\nYoung and Peabody to pack them expertly for store.",
    "Emily bent down boots in hand.",
    "In a minute or two she stood upright flushed incredulous.",
    "So that was it said Emily.",
    "So that was it.",
    "She sank into a chair.",
    "There was still much that she did not\nunderstand.",
    "After some minutes she rose to her feet.",
    "She spoke aloud.",
    "I know who killed Captain Trevelyan she said.",
    "But I dont know\nwhy.",
    "I still cant think why.",
    "But I mustnt lose time.",
    "She hurried out of Hazelmoor.",
    "To find a car to drive her to Sittaford\nwas the work of a few minutes.",
    "She ordered it to take her to Mr\nDukes bungalow.",
    "Here she paid the man and then walked up the\npath as the car drove away.",
    "She lifted the knocker and gave a loud rattat.",
    "After a moment or twos interval the door was opened by a big burly\nman with a rather impassive face.",
    "For the first time Emily met Mr Duke face to face.",
    "Mr Duke she asked.",
    "Yes.",
    "I am Miss Trefusis.",
    "May I come in please\n\n\fThere was a momentary hesitation.",
    "Then he stood aside to let her\npass.",
    "Emily walked into the livingroom.",
    "He closed the front door and followed her.",
    "I want to see Inspector Narracott said Emily.",
    "Is he here\n\nAgain there was a pause.",
    "Mr Duke seemed uncertain how to\nanswer.",
    "At last he appeared to make up his mind.",
    "He smiled  a\nrather curious smile.",
    "Inspector Narracott is here he said.",
    "What do you want to see\nhim about\n\nEmily took the parcel she was carrying and unwrapped it.",
    "She took\nout a pair of boots and placed them on the table in front of him.",
    "I want she said to see him about those boots.",
    "Chapter 29\n\nTHE SECOND S\u0419ANCE\n\nHullo hullo hullo said Ronnie Garfield.",
    "Mr Rycroft slowly ascending the steep slope of the lane from the\npost office paused till Ronnie overtook him.",
    "Been to the local Harrods eh said Ronnie.",
    "Old Mother Hibbert.",
    "No said Mr Rycroft.",
    "I have been for a short walk along past the\nforge.",
    "Very delightful weather today.",
    "Ronnie looked up at the blue sky.",
    "Yes a bit of a difference from last week.",
    "By the way youre going\nto the Willetts I suppose\n\nI am.",
    "You also\n\nYes.",
    "Our bright spot in Sittaford  the Willetts.",
    "Mustnt let yourself\nget downhearted thats their motto.",
    "Carry on as usual.",
    "My aunt\nsays it is unfeeling of them to ask people to tea so soon after the\nfuneral and all that but thats all bunkum.",
    "She just says that\nbecause shes feeling rattled about the Emperor of Peru.",
    "The Emperor of Peru said Mr Rycroft surprised.",
    "One of the blinking cats.",
    "Its turned out to be an Empress instead\nand Aunt Carolines naturally annoyed about it.",
    "She doesnt like\nthese sex problems  so as I say she got her feelings off her chest\nby making catty remarks about the Willetts.",
    "Why shouldnt they ask\npeople to tea Trevelyan wasnt a relation or anything like that.",
    "Very true said Mr Rycroft turning his head and examining a bird\nwhich flew past and in which he thought he recognized a rare\nspecies.",
    "How annoying he murmured.",
    "I havent got my glasses with me.",
    "Eh I say talking of Trevelyan do you think Mrs Willett can have\nknown the old boy better than she says\n\nWhy do you ask that\n\nBecause of the change in her.",
    "Have you ever seen anything like it\nShes aged about twenty years in the last week.",
    "You must have\nnoticed it.",
    "Yes said Mr Rycroft.",
    "I have noticed it.",
    "Well there you are.",
    "Trevelyans death must have been the most\nfrightful shock to her in some way or other.",
    "Queer if she turned out\nto be the old mans long lost wife whom he deserted in his youth and\ndidnt recognize.",
    "I hardly think that likely Mr Garfield.",
    "Bit too much of a Movie stunt eh All the same very odd things\nhappen.",
    "Ive read some really amazing things in the Daily Wire things you wouldnt credit if a newspaper didnt print them.",
    "Are they any more to be credited on that account inquired Mr\nRycroft acidly.",
    "You have got a down on young Enderby havent you said\nRonnie.",
    "I dislike illbred nosing into affairs that do not concern you said\nMr Rycroft.",
    "Yes but then they do concern him Ronnie persisted.",
    "I mean\nnosing about is the poor chaps job.",
    "He seems to have tamed old\nBurnaby all right.",
    "Funny the old boy can hardly bear the sight of\nme.",
    "Im like a red rag to a bull to him.",
    "Mr Rycroft did not reply.",
    "By Jove said Ronnie again glancing up at the sky.",
    "Do you realize\nits Friday Just a week ago today at about this time we were\ntrudging up to the Willetts just as we are now.",
    "But a bit of a change\nin the weather.",
    "A week ago said Mr Rycroft.",
    "It seems infinitely longer.",
    "More like a bally year doesnt it Hullo Abdul.",
    "They were passing Captain Wyatts gate over which the melancholy\nIndian was leaning.",
    "Good afternoon Abdul said Mr Rycroft.",
    "Hows your master\n\nThe native shook his head.",
    "Master bad today Sahib.",
    "Not see anyone.",
    "Not see anyone for long\ntime.",
    "You know said Ronnie as they passed on that chap could\nmurder Wyatt quite easily and no one would know.",
    "He could go on\nfor weeks shaking his head and saying the master wouldnt see\nanyone and no one would think it the least odd.",
    "Mr Rycroft admitted the truth if the statement.",
    "But there would still be the problem of the disposal of the body\nhe pointed out.",
    "Yes thats always the snag isnt it Inconvenient thing a human\nbody.",
    "They passed Major Burnabys cottage.",
    "The Major was in his garden\nlooking sternly at a weed which was growing where no weed should\nbe.",
    "Good afternoon Major said Mr Rycroft.",
    "Are you also coming to\nSittaford House\n\nBurnaby rubbed his nose.",
    "Dont think so.",
    "They sent a note asking me.",
    "But  well  I dont feel\nlike it.",
    "Expect youll understand.",
    "Mr Rycroft bowed his head in token of understanding.",
    "All the same he said I wish youd come.",
    "Ive got a reason.",
    "A reason.",
    "What sort of a reason\n\n\fMr Rycroft hesitated.",
    "It was clear that the presence of Ronnie\nGarfield constrained him.",
    "But Ronnie completely oblivious of the\nfact stood his ground listening with ingenuous interest.",
    "Id like to try an experiment he said at last slowly.",
    "What sort of experiment demanded Burnaby.",
    "Mr Rycroft hesitated.",
    "Id rather not tell you beforehand.",
    "But if you come Ill ask you to\nback me up in anything I suggest.",
    "Burnabys curiosity was aroused.",
    "All right he said.",
    "Ill come.",
    "You can count on me.",
    "Wheres my\nhat\n\nHe rejoined them in a minute hat on head and all three turned in at\nthe gates of Sittaford House.",
    "Hear you are expecting company Rycroft said Burnaby\nconversationally.",
    "A shade of vexation passed over the older mans face.",
    "Who told you that\n\n\fThat chattering magpie of a woman Mrs Curtis.",
    "Shes clean and\nshes honest but her tongue never stops and she pays no attention\nto whether you listen or whether you dont.",
    "Its quite true admitted Mr Rycroft.",
    "I am expecting my niece Mrs\nDering and her husband tomorrow.",
    "They had arrived at the front door by now and on pressing the bell\nit was opened to them by Brian Pearson.",
    "As they removed their overcoats in the hall Mr Rycroft observed\nthe tall broadshouldered young man with an interested eye.",
    "Fine specimen he thought.",
    "Very fine specimen.",
    "Strong temper.",
    "Curious angle of the jaw.",
    "Might be a nasty customer to tackle in\ncertain circumstances.",
    "What you might call a dangerous young\nnan.",
    "A queer feeling of unreality stole over Major Burnaby as he entered\nthe drawingroom and Mrs Willett rose to greet him.",
    "Splendid of you to turn out.",
    "The same words as last week.",
    "The same blazing fire on the hearth.",
    "He fancied but was not sure the same gowns on the two women.",
    "It did give one a queer feeling.",
    "As though it were last week again as though Joe Trevelyan hadnt died  as though nothing had\nhappened or were changed.",
    "Stop that was wrong.",
    "The Willett\nwoman had changed.",
    "A wreck that was the only way of describing\n\n\fher.",
    "No longer the prosperous determined woman of the world but\na broken nervy creature making an obvious and pathetic effort to\nappear as usual.",
    "But Im hanged if I can see what Joes death meant to her\nthought the Major.",
    "For the hundredth time he registered the impression that there was\nsomething deuced odd about the Willetts.",
    "As usual he awoke to the\nrealization that he was being silent and that someone was speaking\nto him.",
    "Our last little gathering I am afraid Mrs Willett was saying.",
    "Whats that Ronnie Garfield looked up suddenly.",
    "Yes.",
    "Mrs Willett shook her head with a wouldbe smile.",
    "We have\ngot to forego the rest of the winter in Sittaford.",
    "Personally of\ncourse I love it  the snow and the tors and the wildness of it all But\nthe domestic problem The domestic problem is too difficult  it\ndefeats me\n\nI thought you were going to get a chauffeurbutler and a handy\nman said Major Burnaby.",
    "A sudden shiver shook Mrs Willetts frame.",
    "No she said I  I have had to give up that idea.",
    "Dear dear said Mr Rycroft.",
    "This is a great blow to us all.",
    "Very\nsad indeed.",
    "We will sink back into our little rut after you have gone.",
    "When do you go by the way\n\nOn Monday I expect said Mrs Willett.",
    "Unless I can get away\ntomorrow.",
    "Its so very awkward with no servants.",
    "Of course I must\narrange things with Mr Kirkwood.",
    "I took the house for four months.",
    "You are going to London inquired Mr Rycroft.",
    "Yes probably to start with anyway.",
    "Then I expect we shall go\nabroad to the Riviera.",
    "A great loss said Mr Rycroft bowing gallantly.",
    "Mrs Willett gave a queer aimless little titter.",
    "Too kind of you Mr Rycroft.",
    "Well shall we have tea\n\nTea was laid ready.",
    "Mrs Willett poured out.",
    "Ronnie and Brian\nhanded things.",
    "A queer kind of embarrassment lay over the party.",
    "What about you said Burnaby abruptly to Brian Pearson.",
    "You\noff too\n\nTo London yes.",
    "Naturally I shant go abroad till this business is\nover.",
    "This business\n\n\fI mean until my brother is cleared of this ridiculous charge.",
    "He flung the words at them defiantly in such a challenging manner\nthat nobody knew quite what to say.",
    "Major Burnaby relieved the situation.",
    "Never have believed he did it.",
    "Not for a moment he said.",
    "None of us think so said Violet flinging him a grateful glance.",
    "The tinkle of a bell broke the ensuing pause.",
    "Thats Mr Duke said Mrs Willett.",
    "Let him in Brian.",
    "Young Pearson had gone to the window.",
    "Its not Duke he said.",
    "Its that damned journalist.",
    "Oh dear said Mrs Willett.",
    "Well I suppose we must let him in all\nthe same.",
    "Brian nodded and reappeared in a few minutes with Charles\nEnderby.",
    "Enderby entered with his usual ingenuous air of beaming\nsatisfaction.",
    "The idea that he might not be welcome did not seem to\noccur to him.",
    "Hullo Mrs Willett.",
    "How are you Thought Id just drop in and see\nhow things were.",
    "I wondered where everyone in Sittaford had got\nto.",
    "Now I see.",
    "Have some tea Mr Enderby\n\nAwfully kind of you.",
    "I will.",
    "I see Emily isnt here.",
    "I suppose shes\nwith your aunt Mr Garfield.",
    "Not that I know of said Ronnie staring.",
    "I thought shed gone to\nExhampton.",
    "Ah but shes back from there.",
    "How do I know A little bird told me.",
    "The Curtis bird to be accurate.",
    "Saw the car pass the post office\nand go up the lane and come back empty.",
    "She is not in No.",
    "5 and\nshes not in Sittaford House.",
    "Puzzle  where is she Failing Miss\nPercehouse she must be sipping tea with that determined lady\nkiller Captain Wyatt.",
    "She may have gone up Sittaford Beacon to see the sunset\nsuggested Mr Rycroft.",
    "Dont think so said Burnaby.",
    "Should have seen her pass.",
    "Ive\nbeen in the garden for the last hour.",
    "Well I dont think its a very vital problem said Charles cheerfully.",
    "I mean I dont think shes been kidnapped or murdered or\nanything.",
    "Thats a pity from the point of view of your paper isnt it sneered\nBrian.",
    "Even for copy I wouldnt sacrifice Emily said Charles.",
    "Emily he\nadded thoughtfully is unique.",
    "Very charming said Mr Rycroft.",
    "Very charming.",
    "We are  er collaborators she and I.",
    "Has everyone finished said Mrs Willett.",
    "What about some\nbridge\n\nEr  one moment said Mr Rycroft.",
    "He cleared his throat importantly.",
    "Everyone looked at him.",
    "Mrs Willett I am as you know deeply interested in psychic\nphenomena.",
    "A week ago today in this very room we had an\namazing indeed an awe inspiring experience.",
    "There was a faint sound from Violet Willett.",
    "He turned to her.",
    "I know my dear Miss Willett I know.",
    "The experience upset you it\nwas upsetting.",
    "I do not deny it.",
    "Now ever since the crime the police\nforce have been seeking the murderer of Captain Trevelyan.",
    "They\nhave made an arrest.",
    "But some of us at least in this room do not\nbelieve that Mr James Pearson is the guilty party.",
    "What I propose is\nthis that we repeat the experiment of last Friday though\napproaching it this time in a rather different spirit.",
    "No cried Violet.",
    "Oh I say said Ronnie.",
    "Thats a bit too thick.",
    "Im not going to join\nin anyway.",
    "Mr Rycroft took no notice of him.",
    "Mrs Willett what do you say\n\nShe hesitated.",
    "Frankly Mr Rycroft I do not like the idea.",
    "I dont like it at all.",
    "That\nmiserable\n\nbusiness\n\nlast\n\nweek\n\nmade\n\na\n\nmost\n\ndisagreeable\n\nimpression on me.",
    "It will take me a long time to forget it.",
    "What are you getting at exactly asked Enderby interestedly.",
    "Do\nyou propose that the spirits should tell us the name of Captain\nTrevelyans murderer That seems a pretty tall order.",
    "It was a pretty tall order as you call it when last week a message\ncame through saying that Captain Trevelyan was dead.",
    "Thats true agreed Enderby.",
    "But  well  you know this idea of\nyours might have consequences you havent considered.",
    "Such as\n\nSupposing a name was mentioned Could you be sure that\nsomeone present did not deliberately \n\n\fHe paused and Ronnie Garfield tendered the word.",
    "Shove.",
    "Thats what he means.",
    "Supposing somebody goes and\nshoves.",
    "This is a serious experiment sir said Mr Rycroft warmly.",
    "Nobody would do such a thing.",
    "I dont know said Ronnie dubiously.",
    "I wouldnt put it past them.",
    "I\ndont mean myself.",
    "I swear I wouldnt but suppose everyone turns\non me and says I have.",
    "Jolly awkward you know.",
    "Mrs Willett I am in earnest.",
    "The little old gentleman disregarded\nRonnie.",
    "I beg of you let us make the experiment.",
    "She wavered.",
    "I dont like it.",
    "I really dont.",
    "I  She looked round her uneasily as\nthough for a way of escape.",
    "Major Burnaby you were Captain\nTrevelyans friend.",
    "What do you say\n\nThe Majors eyes met those of Mr Rycroft.",
    "This he understood was\nthe contingency which the latter had foreshadowed.",
    "Why not he said gruffly.",
    "It had all the decision of a casting vote.",
    "Ronnie went into the adjoining room and brought the small table\nwhich had been used before.",
    "He set it in the middle of the floor and\n\n\fchairs were drawn up round it.",
    "No one spoke.",
    "The experiment was\nclearly not popular.",
    "That is correct I think said Mr Rycroft.",
    "We are about to repeat\nthe experiment of last Friday under precisely similar conditions.",
    "Not precisely similar objected Mrs Willett.",
    "Mr Duke is missing.",
    "True said Mr Rycroft.",
    "A pity he is not here.",
    "A great pity.",
    "Well  er\n we must consider him as replaced by Mr Pearson.",
    "Dont take part in it Brian.",
    "I beg of you.",
    "Please dont cried Violet.",
    "What does it matter Its all nonsense anyway.",
    "That is quite the wrong spirit said Mr Rycroft severely.",
    "Brian Pearson did not reply but took his place beside Violet.",
    "Mr Enderby began Mr Rycroft but Charles interrupted him.",
    "I was not in on this.",
    "Im a journalist and you mistrust me.",
    "Ill take\nnotes in shorthand of any phenomena  thats the word isnt it  that\noccur.",
    "Matters were settled like that.",
    "The other six took their places round\nthe table.",
    "Charles turned off the lights and sat down on the fender.",
    "One minute he said.",
    "Whats the time He peered at his wrist\nwatch in the firelight.",
    "Thats odd he said.",
    "Whats odd\n\nIts just twentyfive minutes past five...\n\nViolet uttered a little cry.",
    "Mr Rycroft said severely\n\nSilence.",
    "The minutes passed.",
    "A very different atmosphere this time than a\nweek ago.",
    "There was no muffled laughter no whispered comments\n only silence broken at last by a short crack from the table.",
    "Mr Rycrofts voice rose Is there anyone there\n\nAnother faint crack  somehow an eerie sound in that darkened\nroom.",
    "Is anyone there\n\nNo knock this time but a deafening tremendous rap.",
    "Violet screamed and Mrs Willett gave a cry.",
    "Brian Pearsons voice rose reassuringly.",
    "Its all right.",
    "Thats a knock at the front door.",
    "Ill go and open it.",
    "He strode from the room without a comment from anybody.",
    "Suddenly the door flew open the lights were switched on.",
    "In the doorway stood Inspector Narracott.",
    "Behind him were Emily\nTrefusis and Mr Duke.",
    "Narracott took a step into the room and spoke.",
    "John Burnaby I charge you with the murder of Joseph Trevelyan\non Friday the 14th instant and I hereby warn you that anything you\nmay say will be taken down and may be used in evidence.",
    "Chapter 30\n\nEMILY EXPLAINS\n\nIt was a crowd of people almost too surprised for words that\ncrowded round Emily Trefusis.",
    "Inspector Narracott had led his prisoner from the room.",
    "Charles Enderby found his voice first.",
    "For heavens sake cough it up Emily he said.",
    "I want to get to\nthe telegraph office.",
    "Every moments vital.",
    "It was Major Burnaby who killed Captain Trevelyan.",
    "Well I saw Narracott arrest him.",
    "And I suppose Narracotts sane hasnt gone off his nut suddenly.",
    "But how can Burnaby have killed\nTrevelyan I mean how is it humanly possible If Trevelyan was\nkilled at five and twenty past five \n\nHe wasnt.",
    "He was killed at about a quarter to six.",
    "Well but even then  I know.",
    "Youd never guess unless you just\nhappened to think of it.",
    "Skis  thats the explanation  skis.",
    "Skis repeated everyone.",
    "Emily nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "He deliberately engineered that table turning.",
    "It wasnt\naccident and done unconsciously as we thought Charles.",
    "It was\nthe second alternative that we rejected  done on purpose.",
    "He saw\nit was going to snow before very long.",
    "That would make it perfectly\nsafe and wipe out all tracks.",
    "He created the impression that\nCaptain Trevelyan was dead  got everyone all worked up.",
    "Then he\npretended to be very upset and insisted on starting off for\nExhampton.",
    "He went home buckled on his skis they were kept in a shed in the\ngarden with a lot of other tackle and started.",
    "He was an expert on\nskis.",
    "Its all down hill to Exhampton  a wonderful run.",
    "It would only\ntake about ten minutes.",
    "He arrived at the window and rapped.",
    "Captain Trevelyan let him in\nall unsuspecting.",
    "Then when Captain Trevelyans back was turned\nhe seized his opportunity picked up that sandbag thing and  and\nkilled him.",
    "Ugh It makes me sick to think of it.",
    "She shuddered.",
    "It was all quite easy.",
    "He had plenty of time.",
    "He must have wiped\nand cleaned the skis and then put them into the cupboard in the\ndiningroom pushed in among all the other things.",
    "Then I suppose\nhe forced the window and pulled out all the drawers and things  to\nmake it look as though someone had broken in.",
    "Then just before eight oclock all he had to do was to go out make\na detour on to the road higher up and come puffing and panting into\nExhampton as though hed walked all the way from Sittaford.",
    "So\nlong as no one suspected about the skis hed be perfectly safe.",
    "The\ndoctor couldnt fail to say that Captain Trevelyan had been dead at\nleast two hours.",
    "And as I say so long as no one thought of skis\nMajor Burnaby would have a perfect alibi.",
    "But they were friends  Burnaby and Trevelyan said Mr Rycroft.",
    "Old friends  theyve always been friends.",
    "Its incredible.",
    "I know said Emily.",
    "Thats what I thought.",
    "I couldnt see why.",
    "I\npuzzled and I puzzled and at last I had to come to Inspector\nNarracott and Mr Duke.",
    "She paused and looked at the impassive Mr Duke.",
    "May I tell them she said.",
    "Mr Duke smiled.",
    "If you like Miss Trefusis.",
    "Anyway  no perhaps youd rather I didnt.",
    "I went to them and we\ngot the thing clear.",
    "Do you remember telling me Charles that\nEvans mentioned that Captain Trevelyan used to send in solutions\nof competitions in his name He thought Sittaford House was too\ngrand an address.",
    "Well  thats what he did in that Football\nCompetition that you gave Major Burnaby five thousand pounds for.",
    "It was Captain Trevelyans solution really and he sent it in in\nBurnabys name.",
    "No.",
    "1 The Cottages Sittaford sounded much\nbetter he thought.",
    "Well you see what happened On Friday\nmorning Major Burnaby got the letter saying hed won five thousand\npounds and by the way that ought to have made us suspicious.",
    "He\ntold you he never got the letter  that nothing had come through on\nFriday owing to the weather.",
    "That was a lie.",
    "Friday morning was the\nlast day things did come through.",
    "Where was I Oh  Major\nBurnaby getting the letter.",
    "He wanted that five thousand  wanted it\nbadly.",
    "Hed been investing in some rotten shares or other and had\nlost a terrible lot of money.",
    "The idea must have come into his head quite suddenly I should\nthink.",
    "Perhaps when he realized it was going to snow that evening.",
    "If Trevelyan were dead  he could keep that money and no one\nwould ever know.",
    "Amazing murmured Mr Rycroft.",
    "Quite amazing.",
    "I never dreamed\n But my dear young lady how did you learn all this What put you\non the right track\n\nFor answer Emily explained Mrs Bellings letter and told how she\nhad discovered the boots in the chimney.",
    "It was looking at them that put it into my mind.",
    "They were ski\nboots you see and it made me think of skis.",
    "And suddenly I\nwondered if perhaps  I rushed downstairs to the cupboard and\nsure enough there were two pairs of skis there.",
    "One pair was\nlonger than the other.",
    "And the boots fitted the long pair  but they\ndidnt fit the other.",
    "The toe clip things were adjusted for a much\nsmaller pair of boots.",
    "The shorter pair of skis belonged to a\ndifferent person.",
    "He ought to have hidden the skis somewhere else said Mr\nRycroft with artistic disapproval.",
    "No  no said Emily.",
    "Where else could he hide them It was a very\ngood place really.",
    "In a day or two the whole collection would have\nbeen stored and in the meantime it wasnt likely that the police\nwould bother whether Captain Trevelyan had had one or two pairs\nof skis.",
    "But why did he hide the boots\n\nI suppose said Emily that he was afraid the police might do\nexactly what I did  The sight of ski boots might have suggested skis\nto them.",
    "So he stuffed them up the chimney.",
    "And thats really of\n\n\fcourse where he made his mistake because Evans noticed that\ntheyd gone and I got to know of it.",
    "Did he deliberately mean to fasten the crime on Jim demanded\nBrian Pearson angrily.",
    "Oh no.",
    "That was just Jims usual idiotic luck.",
    "He was an idiot poor\nlamb.",
    "Hes all right now said Charles.",
    "You neednt worry about him.",
    "Have you told me everything Emily because if so I want to rush to\nthe telegraph office.",
    "Youll excuse me everybody.",
    "He dashed out of the room.",
    "The live wire said Emily.",
    "Mr Duke spoke in his deep voice.",
    "Youve been rather a live wire yourself Miss Trefusis.",
    "You have said Ronnie admiringly.",
    "Oh dear said Emily suddenly and dropped limply on a chair.",
    "What you need is a pickmeup said Ronnie.",
    "A cocktail eh\n\nEmily shook her head.",
    "A little brandy suggested Mr Rycroft solicitiously.",
    "A cup of tea suggested Violet.",
    "Id like a spot of face powder said Emily wistfully.",
    "Ive left my\npowder puff in the car.",
    "And I know Im simply shining with\nexcitement.",
    "Violet led her upstairs in search of this sedative to the nerves.",
    "Thats better said Emily dabbing her nose firmly.",
    "What a nice\nkind.",
    "I feel much better now.",
    "Have you got any lipstick I feel almost\nhuman.",
    "Youve been wonderful said Violet.",
    "So brave.",
    "Not really said Emily.",
    "Underneath this camouflage Ive been as\nwobbly as a jelly with a sort of sick feeling in my middle.",
    "I know said Violet.",
    "Ive felt much the same myself.",
    "I have been\nso terrified this last few days  about Brian you know.",
    "They couldnt\nhang him for murdering Captain Trevelyan of course but if once he\nhad said where he was during that time they would soon have\nferreted out that it was he who engineered fathers escape.",
    "Whats that said Emily pausing in her facial repairs.",
    "Father was the convict who escaped.",
    "Thats why we came here.",
    "Mother and I.",
