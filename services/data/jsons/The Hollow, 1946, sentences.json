    "THE HOLLOW\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nAt 613 a.m. on a Friday morning Lucy Angkatells big blue eyes\nopened upon another day and as always she was at once wide awake\nand began immediately to deal with the problems conjured up by her\nincredibly active mind.",
    "Feeling urgently the need of consultation and\nconversation and selecting for the purpose her young cousin Midge\nHardcastle who had arrived at The Hollow the night before Lady\nAngkatell slipped quickly out of bed threw a negligee round her still\ngraceful shoulders and went along the passage to Midges room.",
    "Since she was a woman of disconcertingly rapid thought processes\nLady Angkatell as was her invariable custom commenced the\nconversation in her own mind supplying Midges answers out of her\nown fertile imagination.",
    "The conversation was in full swing when Lady Angkatell flung open\nMidges door.",
    "And so darling you really must agree that the weekend is going to\npresent difficulties\n\nEh Hwah Midge grunted inarticulately aroused thus abruptly from\na satisfying and deep sleep.",
    "Lady Angkatell crossed to the window opening the shutters and\njerking up the blind with a brisk movement letting in the pale light of a\nSeptember dawn.",
    "Birds she observed peering with kindly pleasure through the pane.",
    "So sweet.",
    "What\n\nWell at any rate the weather isnt going to present difficulties.",
    "It looks\nas though it had set in fine.",
    "Thats something.",
    "Because if a lot of\ndiscordant personalities are boxed up indoors Im sure you will agree\nwith me that it makes it ten times worse.",
    "Round games perhaps and\nthat would be like last year when I shall never forgive myself about\npoor Gerda.",
    "I said to Henry afterwards it was most thoughtless of me and one has to have her of course because it would be so rude to ask\nJohn without her but it really does make things difficult  and the worst\nof it is that she is so nice  really it seems odd sometimes that anyone\nso nice as Gerda is should be so devoid of any kind of intelligence and\nif that is what they mean by the law of compensation I dont really think\nit is at all fair.",
    "What are you talking about Lucy\n\nThe weekend darling.",
    "The people who are coming tomorrow.",
    "I have\nbeen thinking about it all night and I have been dreadfully bothered\nabout it.",
    "So it really is a relief to talk it over with you Midge.",
    "You are\nalways so sensible and practical.",
    "Lucy said Midge sternly do you know what time it is\n\n\fNot exactly darling.",
    "I never do you know.",
    "Its quarter past six.",
    "Yes dear said Lady Angkatell with no signs of contrition.",
    "Midge gazed sternly at her.",
    "How maddening how absolutely\nimpossible Lucy was Really thought Midge.",
    "I dont know why we put\nup with her\n\nYet even as she voiced the thought to herself she was aware of the\nanswer.",
    "Lucy Angkatell was smiling and as Midge looked at her she\nfelt the extraordinary pervasive charm that Lucy had wielded all her\nlife and that even now at over sixty had not failed her.",
    "Because of it\npeople all over the world foreign potentates A.D.Cs Government\nofficials had endured inconvenience annoyance and bewilderment.",
    "It\nwas the childlike pleasure and delight in her own doing that disarmed\nand nullified criticism.",
    "Lucy had but to open those wide blue eyes and\nstretch out those fragile hands and murmur.",
    "Oh but Im so sorry...\nand resentment immediately vanished.",
    "Darling said Lady Angkatell Im so sorry.",
    "You should have told\nme\n\nIm telling you now  but its too late Im thoroughly awake.",
    "What a shame.",
    "But you will help me wont you\n\nAbout the weekend Why Whats wrong with it\n\n\fLady Angkatell sat down on the edge of the bed.",
    "It was not Midge\nthought like anyone else sitting on your bed.",
    "It was as unsubstantial\nas though a fairy had poised itself there for a minute.",
    "Lady Angkatell stretched out fluttering white hands in a lovely\nhelpless gesture.",
    "All the wrong people coming  the wrong people to be together I\nmean  not in themselves.",
    "Theyre all charming really.",
    "Who is coming\n\nMidge pushed thick wiry black hair back from her square forehead\nwith a sturdy brown arm.",
    "Nothing unsubstantial or fairylike about her.",
    "Well John and Gerda.",
    "Thats all right by itself.",
    "I mean John is\ndelightful  most attractive.",
    "And as for poor Gerda  well I mean we\nmust all be very kind.",
    "Very very kind.",
    "Moved by an obscure instinct of defence Midge said\n\nOh come now shes not as bad as that.",
    "Oh darling shes pathetic.",
    "Those eyes.",
    "And she never seems to\nunderstand a single word one says.",
    "She doesnt said Midge.",
    "Not what you say  but I dont know that I\nblame her.",
    "Your mind.",
    "Lucy goes so fast that to keep pace with it your\n\n\fconversation takes the most amazing leaps.",
    "All the connecting links\nare left out.",
    "Just like a monkey said Lady Angkatell vaguely.",
    "But who else is coming beside the Christows Henrietta I suppose\n\nLady Angkatells face brightened.",
    "Yes  and I really do feel that she will be a tower of strength.",
    "She\nalways is.",
    "Henrietta you know is really kind  kind all through not just\non top.",
    "She will help a lot with poor Gerda.",
    "She was simply wonderful\nlast year.",
    "That was the time we played limericks or wordmaking or\nquotations  or one of those things and we had all finished and were\nreading them out when we suddenly discovered that poor dear Gerda\nhadnt even begun.",
    "She wasnt even sure what the game was.",
    "It was\ndreadful wasnt it Midge\n\nWhy anyone ever comes to stay with the Angkatells I dont know\nsaid Midge.",
    "What with the brainwork and the round games and your\npeculiar style of conversation Lucy.",
    "Yes darling we must be trying  and it must always be hateful for\nGerda and I often think that if she had any spirit she would stay away but however there it was and the poor dear looked so bewildered\nand  well  mortified you know.",
    "And John looked so dreadfully\nimpatient.",
    "And I simply couldnt think of how to make things all right\nagain  and it was then that I felt so grateful to Henrietta.",
    "She turned\nright round to Gerda and asked about the pullover she was wearing really a dreadful affair in faded lettuce green  too depressing and\n\n\fjumble sale darling  and Gerda brightened up at once it seems that\nshe had knitted it herself and Henrietta asked her for the pattern and\nGerda looked so happy and proud.",
    "And that is what I mean about\nHenrietta.",
    "She can always do that sort of thing.",
    "Its a kind of knack.",
    "She takes trouble said Midge slowly.",
    "Yes and she knows what to say.",
    "Ah said Midge.",
    "But it goes further than saying.",
    "Do you know Lucy\nthat Henrietta actually knitted that pullover.",
    "Oh my dear.",
    "Lady Angkatell looked grave.",
    "And wore it\n\nAnd wore it.",
    "Henrietta carries things through.",
    "And was it very dreadful\n\nNo.",
    "On Henrietta it looked very nice.",
    "Well of course it would.",
    "Thats just the difference between Henrietta\nand Gerda.",
    "Everything Henrietta does she does well and it turns out\nright.",
    "Shes clever about nearly everything as well as in her own line.",
    "I\nmust say Midge that if anyone carries us through this weekend it will\nbe Henrietta.",
    "She will be nice to Gerda and she will amuse Henry and\nshell keep John in a good temper and Im sure shell be most helpful\nwith David \n\nDavid Angkatell\n\n\fYes.",
    "Hes just down from Oxford  or perhaps Cambridge.",
    "Boys of that\nage are so difficult  especially when they are intellectual.",
    "David is very\nintellectual.",
    "One wishes that they could put off being intellectual until\nthey were rather older.",
    "As it is they always glower at one so and bite\ntheir nails and seem to have so many spots and sometimes an Adams\napple as well.",
    "And they either wont speak at all or else are very loud\nand contradictory.",
    "Still as I say I am trusting to Henrietta.",
    "She is very\ntactful and asks the right kind of questions and being a sculptress\nthey respect her especially as she doesnt just carve animals or\nchildrens heads but does advanced things like that curious affair in\nmetal and plaster that she exhibited at the New Artists last year.",
    "It\nlooked rather like a Heath Robinson step ladder.",
    "It was called\nAscending Thought  or something like that.",
    "It is the kind of thing that\nwould impress a boy like David...",
    "I thought myself it was just silly.",
    "Dear Lucy\n\nBut some of Henriettas things I think are quite lovely.",
    "That Weeping\nAsh tree figure for instance.",
    "Henrietta has a touch of real genius I think.",
    "And she is a very lovely\nand satisfying person as well said Midge.",
    "Lady Angkatell got up and drifted over to the window again.",
    "She\nplayed absentmindedly with the blind cord.",
    "Why acorns I wonder she murmured.",
    "Acorns\n\n\fOn the blind cord.",
    "Like pineapples on gates.",
    "I mean there must be a\nreason.",
    "Because it might just as easily be a fir cone or a pear but its\nalways an acorn.",
    "Mash they call it in crosswords  you know for pigs.",
    "So curious I always think.",
    "Dont ramble off Lucy.",
    "You came in here to talk about the weekend\nand I cant see why you are so anxious about it.",
    "If you manage to keep\noff round games and try to be coherent when youre talking to Gerda\nand put Henrietta on to tame the intellectual David where is the\ndifficulty\n\nWell for one thing darling Edward is coming.",
    "Oh Edward.",
    "Midge was silent for a moment after saying the name.",
    "Then she asked quietly\n\nWhat on earth made you ask Edward for this weekend\n\nI didnt Midge.",
    "Thats just it.",
    "He asked himself.",
    "Wired to know if we\ncould have him.",
    "You know what Edward is.",
    "How sensitive.",
    "If Id wired\nback No hed probably never have asked himself again.",
    "Hes like\nthat.",
    "Midge nodded her head slowly.",
    "Yes she thought Edward was like that.",
    "For an instant she saw his face\nclearly that very dearly loved face.",
    "A face with something of Lucys\ninsubstantial charm gentle diffident ironic...\n\n\fDear Edward said Lucy echoing the thought in Midges mind.",
    "She went on impatiently\n\nIf only Henrietta would make up her mind to marry him.",
    "She is really\nfond of him I know she is.",
    "If they had been here some weekend without\nthe Christows... As it is John Christow has always the most\nunfortunate effect on Edward.",
    "John if you know what I mean becomes\nso much more so and Edward becomes so much less so.",
    "You\nunderstand.",
    "Again Midge nodded.",
    "And I cant put the Christows off because the weekend was arranged\nlong ago but I do feel Midge that it is all going to be difficult with\nDavid glowering and biting his nails and with trying to keep Gerda\nfrom feeling out of it and with John being so positive and dear Edward\nso negative \n\nThe ingredients of the pudding are not promising murmured Midge.",
    "Lucy smiled at her.",
    "Sometimes she said meditatively things arrange themselves quite\nsimply.",
    "Ive asked the crime man to lunch on Sunday.",
    "It will make a\ndistraction dont you think so\n\nCrime man\n\n\fLike an egg said Lady Angkatell.",
    "He was in Baghdad solving\nsomething when Henry was high commissioner.",
    "Or perhaps it was\nafterwards We had him to lunch with some other duty people.",
    "He had\non a white duck suit I remember and a pink flower in his buttonhole\nand black patent leather shoes.",
    "I dont remember much about it\nbecause I never think its very interesting who killed who.",
    "I mean once\nthey are dead it doesnt seem to matter why and to make a fuss about\nit all seems so silly.",
    "But have you any crimes down here Lucy\n\nOh no darling.",
    "Hes in one of those funny new cottages  you know\nbeams that bump your head and a lot of very good plumbing and quite\nthe wrong kind of garden.",
    "London people like that sort of thing.",
    "Theres an actress in the other I believe.",
    "They dont live in them all the\ntime like we do.",
    "Still Lady Angkatell moved vaguely across the room\nI daresay it pleases them.",
    "Midge darling its sweet of you to have\nbeen so helpful.",
    "I dont think I have been so very helpful.",
    "Oh havent you Lucy Angkatell looked surprised.",
    "Well have a nice\nsleep now and dont get up to breakfast and when you do get up do\nbe as rude as ever you like.",
    "Rude Midge looked surprised.",
    "Why Oh she laughed.",
    "I see\nPenetrating of you Lucy.",
    "Perhaps Ill take you at your word.",
    "Lady Angkatell smiled and went out.",
    "As she passed the open bathroom\ndoor and saw the kettle and gas ring an idea came to her.",
    "People were fond of tea she knew  and Midge wouldnt be called for\nhours.",
    "She would make Midge some tea.",
    "She put the kettle on and then\nwent on down the passage.",
    "She paused at her husbands door and turned the handle but Sir\nHenry Angkatell that able administrator knew his Lucy.",
    "He was\nextremely fond of her but he liked his morning sleep undisturbed.",
    "The\ndoor was locked.",
    "Lady Angkatell went on into her own room.",
    "She would have liked to\nhave consulted Henry but later would do.",
    "She stood by her open\nwindow looking out for a moment or two then she yawned.",
    "She got\ninto bed laid her head on the pillow and in two minutes was sleeping\nlike a child.",
    "In the bathroom the kettle came to the boil and went on boiling...\n\nAnother kettle gone Mr. Gudgeon said Simmons the housemaid.",
    "Gudgeon the butler shook his grey head.",
    "He took the burntout kettle from Simmons and going into the pantry\nproduced another kettle from the bottom of the plate cupboard where\nhe had a stock of half a dozen.",
    "There you are Miss Simmons.",
    "Her ladyship will never know.",
    "Does her ladyship often do this kind of thing asked Simmons.",
    "Gudgeon sighed.",
    "Her ladyship he said is at once kindhearted and very forgetful if\nyou know what I mean.",
    "But in this house he continued I see to it that\neverything possible is done to spare her ladyship annoyance or\nworry.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nHenrietta Savernake rolled up a little strip of clay and patted it into\nplace.",
    "She was building up the clay head of a girl with swift practised\nskill.",
    "In her ears but penetrating only to the edge of her understanding was\nthe thin whine of a slightly common voice\n\nAnd I do think Miss Savernake that I was quite right Really I said\nif thats the line youre going to take Because I do think Miss\nSavernake that a girl owes it to herself to make a stand about these\nsort of things  if you know what I mean.",
    "Im not accustomed I said to\nhaving things like that said to me and I can only say that you must\nhave a very nasty imagination One does hate unpleasentness but I do\nthink I was right to make a stand dont you Miss Savernake\n\nOh absolutely said Henrietta with a fervour in her voice which might\nhave led someone who knew her well to suspect that she had not been\nlistening very closely.",
    "And if your wife says things of that kind I said well Im sure I cant\nhelp it I dont know how it is Miss Savernake but it seems to be\ntrouble wherever I go and Im sure its not my fault.",
    "I mean men are so\nsusceptible arent they The model gave a coquettish little giggle.",
    "Frightfully said Henrietta her eyes half closed.",
    "Lovely she was thinking.",
    "Lovely that plane just below the eyelid and the other plane coming up to meet it.",
    "That angle by the jaws\nwrong...",
    "I must scrape off there and build up again.",
    "Its tricky.",
    "Aloud she said in her warm sympathetic voice\n\nIt must have been most difficult for you.",
    "I do think jealousys so unfair Miss Savernake and so narrow if you\nknow what I mean.",
    "Its just envy if I may say so because someones\nbetter looking and younger than they are.",
    "Henrietta working on the jaw said absently Yes of course.",
    "She had learned the trick years ago of shutting her mind into\nwatertight compartments.",
    "She could play a game of bridge conduct\nan intelligent conversation write a clearly constructed letter all\nwithout giving more than a fraction of her essential mind to the task.",
    "She was now completely intent on seeing the head of Nausicaa build\nitself up under her fingers and the thin spiteful stream of chatter\nissuing from those very lovely childish lips penetrated not at all into the\ndeeper recesses of her mind.",
    "She kept the conversation going without\n\n\feffort.",
    "She was used to models who wanted to talk.",
    "Not so much the\nprofessional ones  it was the amateurs who uneasy at their forced\ninactivity of limb made up for it by bursting into garrulous selfrevelation.",
    "So an inconspicuous part of Henrietta listened and replied\nand very far and remote the real Henrietta commented Common\nmean spiteful little piece  but what eyes... Lovely lovely lovely\neyes...\n\nWhilst she was busy on the eyes let the girl talk.",
    "She would ask her to\nkeep silent when she got to the mouth.",
    "Funny when you came to think\nof it that that thin stream of spite should come out through those\nperfect curves.",
    "Oh damn thought Henrietta with sudden frenzy.",
    "Im ruining that\neyebrow arch What the hells the matter with it Ive overemphasized\nthe bone  its sharp not thick...\n\nShe stood back again frowning from the clay to the flesh and blood\nsitting on the platform.",
    "Doris Sanders went on\n\nWell I said I really dont see why your husband shouldnt give me a\npresent if he likes and I dont think I said you ought to make\ninsinuations of that kind.",
    "It was ever such a nice bracelet Miss\nSavernake reely quite lovely  and of course I daresay the poor fellow\ncouldnt really afford it but I do think it was nice of him and I certainly\nwasnt going to give it back\n\nNo no murmured Henrietta.",
    "And its not as though there was anything between us  anything\nnasty I mean  there was nothing of that kind.",
    "No said Henrietta Im sure there wouldnt be.",
    "Her brow cleared.",
    "For the next half hour she worked in a kind of fury.",
    "Clay smeared itself\non her forehead clung to her hair as she pushed an impatient hand\nthrough it.",
    "Her eyes had a blind intense ferocity.",
    "It was coming... she\nwas getting it...\n\nNow in a few hours she would be out of her agony  the agony that\nhad been growing upon her for the last ten days.",
    "Nausicaa  she had been haunted by Nausicaa she had got up with\nNausicaa and had breakfasted with Nausicaa and had gone out with\nNausicaa.",
    "She had tramped the streets in a nervous excitable\nrestlessness unable to fix her mind on anything but a beautiful blind\nface somewhere just beyond her minds eye  hovering there just not\nable to be clearly seen.",
    "She had interviewed models hesitated over\nGreek types felt profoundly dissatisfied...\n\nShe wanted something  something to give her the start  something\nthat would bring her own already partially realized vision alive.",
    "She\nhad walked long distances getting physically tired out and welcoming\nthe fact.",
    "And driving her harrying her was that urgent incessant\nlonging  to see \n\nThere was a blind look in her own eyes as she walked.",
    "She saw nothing\nof what was around her.",
    "She was straining  straining the whole time to\nmake that face come nearer... She felt sick ill miserable...\n\n\fAnd then suddenly her vision had cleared and with normal human\neyes she had seen opposite her in the bus which she had boarded\nabsentmindedly and with no interest in its destination  she had seen yes Nausicaa\n\nA foreshortened childish face half parted lips and eyes  lovely\nvacant blind eyes.",
    "The girl rang the bell and got out Henrietta followed her.",
    "She was now quite calm and businesslike.",
    "She had got what she\nwanted  the agony of baffled search was over.",
    "Excuse me for speaking to you.",
    "Im a professional sculptor and to put\nit frankly your head is just what I have been looking for.",
    "She was friendly charming and compelling as she knew how to be\nwhen she wanted something.",
    "Doris Sanders had been doubtful alarmed flattered.",
    "Well I dont know Im sure.",
    "If its just the head.",
    "Of course Ive never\ndone that sort of thing\n\nSuitable hesitations delicate financial inquiry.",
    "Of course I should insist on your accepting the proper professional\nfee.",
    "And so here was Nausicaa sitting on the platform enjoying the idea of\nher attractions being immortalized though not liking very much the\nexamples of Henriettas work which she could see in the studio and\nenjoying also the revelation of her personality to a listener whose\nsympathy and attention seemed to be so complete.",
    "On the table beside the model were her spectacles  the spectacles\nthat she put on as seldom as possible owing to vanity preferring to\nfeel her way almost blindly sometimes since she admitted to Henrietta\nthat without them she was so shortsighted that she could hardly see a\nyard in front of her.",
    "Henrietta had nodded comprehendingly.",
    "She understood now the\nphysical reason for that blank and lovely stare.",
    "Time went on.",
    "Henrietta suddenly laid down her modelling tools and\nstretched her arms wide.",
    "All right she said Ive finished.",
    "I hope youre not too tired\n\nOh no thank you Miss Savernake.",
    "Its been very interesting Im\nsure.",
    "Do you mean its really done  so soon\n\nHenrietta laughed.",
    "Oh no its not actually finished.",
    "I still have to work on it quite a bit.",
    "But its finished as far as youre concerned.",
    "Ive got what I wanted built up the planes.",
    "The girl came down slowly from the platform.",
    "She put on her\nspectacles and at once the blind innocence and vague confiding\ncharm of the face vanished.",
    "There remained now an easy cheap\nprettiness.",
    "She came to stand by Henrietta and look at the clay model.",
    "Oh she said doubtfully disappointment in her voice its not very\nlike me is it\n\nHenrietta smiled.",
    "Oh no its not a portrait.",
    "There was indeed hardly a likeness at all.",
    "It was the setting of the\neyes  the line of the cheekbone  that Henrietta had seen as the\nessential keynote of her conception of Nausicaa.",
    "This was not Doris\nSanders it was a blind girl about whom a poem could be made.",
    "The\nlips were parted as Doriss were parted but they were not Doriss lips.",
    "They were lips that would speak another language and would utter\nthoughts that were not Doriss thoughts \n\nNone of the features were clearly defined.",
    "It was Nausicaa\nremembered not seen...\n\nWell said Miss Sanders doubtfully I suppose itll look better when\nyouve got on with it a bit... And you reely dont want me any more\n\nNo thank you said Henrietta.",
    "And thank God I dont said her\ninner mind.",
    "Youve been simply splendid.",
    "Im very grateful.",
    "She got rid of Doris expertly and returned to make herself some black\ncoffee.",
    "She was tired  she was horribly tired...",
    "But happy  happy and\nat peace.",
    "Thank goodness she thought now I can be a human being again.",
    "And at once her thoughts went to John...\n\nJohn she thought.",
    "Warmth crept into her cheeks a sudden quick\nlifting of the heart made her spirits soar.",
    "Tomorrow she thought Im going to The Hollow...",
    "I shall see John...\n\nShe sat quite still sprawled back on the divan drinking down the hot\nstrong liquid.",
    "She drank three cups of it... She felt vitality surging\nback...",
    "It feels nice she thought to be a human being again not that other\nthing.",
    "Nice to have stopped feeling restless and miserable and driven.",
    "Nice to be able to stop walking about the streets unhappily looking for\nsomething and feeling irritable and impatient because really you\ndidnt know what you were looking for Now thank goodness there\nwould be only hard work  and who minded hard work\n\nShe put down the empty cup and got up and strolled back to Nausicaa.",
    "She looked at the face for some time and slowly a little frown crept\nbetween her brows.",
    "It wasnt  it wasnt quite \n\n\fWhat was it that was wrong...",
    "Blind eyes...",
    "Blind eyes that were more beautiful than any eyes that could see...",
    "Blind eyes that tore at your heart because they were blind... Had she\ngot that or hadnt she\n\nShed got it yes  but shed got something else as well.",
    "Something that\nshe hadnt meant or thought about...",
    "The structure was all right  yes\nsurely.",
    "But where did it come from  that faint insidious suggestion...",
    "The suggestion somewhere of a common spiteful mind...\n\nShe hadnt been listening not really listening.",
    "Yet somehow in\nthrough her ears and out at her fingers it had worked its way into the\nclay.",
    "And she wouldnt she knew she wouldnt be able to get it out again...\n\nHenrietta turned away sharply.",
    "Perhaps it was fancy.",
    "Yes surely it was\nfancy.",
    "She would feel quite differently about it in the morning.",
    "She\nthought with dismay how vulnerable one is.",
    "She walked frowning up to the end of the studio.",
    "She stopped in front\nof her figure of The Worshipper.",
    "That was all right  a lovely bit of pearwood graining just right.",
    "Shed\nsaved it up for ages hoarding it.",
    "She looked at it critically.",
    "Yes it was good No doubt about that.",
    "The\nbest thing she had done for a long time  it was for the International\nGroup.",
    "Yes quite a worthy exhibit.",
    "Shed got it all right the humility the strength in the neck muscles the\nbowed shoulders the slightly upraised face  a featureless face since\nworship drives out personality  yes submission adoration  and that\nfinal devotion that is beyond not this side idolatry.",
    "Henrietta sighed.",
    "If only she thought John had not been so angry...",
    "It had startled her that anger.",
    "It had told her something about him that\nhe did not she thought know himself.",
    "He had said flatly You cant exhibit that\n\nAnd she had said as flatly I shall.",
    "She went slowly back to Nausicaa.",
    "There was nothing there she\nthought that she couldnt put right.",
    "She sprayed it and wrapped it up\nin the damp cloths.",
    "It would have to stand over until Monday or\nTuesday.",
    "There was no hurry now.",
    "The urgency had gone  all the\nessential planes were there.",
    "It only needed patience.",
    "Ahead of her were three happy days with Lucy and Henry and Midge and John\n\n\fShe yawned stretched herself like a cat stretches itself with relish and\nabandon pulling out each muscle to its fullest extent.",
    "She knew\nsuddenly how very tired she was.",
    "She had a hot bath and went to bed.",
    "She lay on her back staring at a\nstar or two through the skylight.",
    "Then from there her eyes went to the\none light she always left on the small bulb that illuminated the glass\nmask that had been one of her earliest bits of work.",
    "Rather an obvious\npiece she thought now.",
    "Conventional in its suggestion.",

    "Oh dear\nhow cold the gravy was getting  a skin was forming on the top of it she must send it back  but then if John were just coming  and surely\nhe would be coming now \n\nHer mind went round and round unhappily... like a trapped animal.",

    "Thought\nof her suddenly not as herself but of her beauty and her freshness\nher health and her radiant vitality  and the faint smell of primroses that\nclung about her hair.",
    "And he had gone to Henrietta straight away sending a curt telephone\nmessage home about being called away.",
    "He had strode into the studio\nand taken Henrietta in his arms holding her to him with a fierceness\nthat was new in their relationship\n\nThere had been a quick startled wonder in her eyes.",

    "But at first unwillingly then more fluently he answered her questions.",
    "And presently he was striding up and down pouring out a spate of\ntechnical explanations and surmises.",
    "Once or twice he paused trying\nto simplify  to explain.",
    "You see you have to get a reaction \n\n\fHenrietta said quickly\n\nYes yes the D.L.",
    "reaction has to be positive.",
    "I understand that.",

    "Go on.",
    "Im following you all right.",
    "Well he said doubtfully remember Scobells unsound.",
    "He went on\ntalking.",
    "He talked for two hours and a half.",
    "Reviewing the setbacks\nanalyzing the possibilities outlining possible theories.",
    "He was hardly\nconscious of Henriettas presence.",
    "And yet more than once as he\nhesitated her quick intelligence took him a step of the way seeing\nalmost before he did what he was hesitating to advance.",
    "He was\ninterested now and his belief in himself was creeping back.",

    "Does it matter\n\nNo.",

    "He wasnt used to it.",
    "Gerda took him in deadly earnest.",
    "And Veronica\nhad never thought about anything but herself.",
    "But Henrietta had a trick\nof throwing her head back of looking at him through halfclosed eyes\nwith a sudden tender halfmocking little smile as though she were\nsaying Let me have a good look at this funny person called John...\nLet me get a long way away and look at him...",
    "It was he thought very much the same as the way she screwed up her\neyes to look at her work  or a picture.",
    "It was  damn it all  it was\ndetached.",
    "He didnt want Henrietta to be detached.",
    "He wanted\nHenrietta to think only of him never to let her mind stray away from\nhim.",
    "Just what you object to in Gerda in fact said his private imp\nbobbing up again.",
    "The truth of it was that he was completely illogical.",
    "He didnt know\nwhat he wanted.",
    "I want to go home... What an absurd what a ridiculous phrase.",
    "It\ndidnt mean anything.",
    "In an hour or so at any rate hed be driving out of London  forgetting\nabout sick people with their faint sour wrong smell... sniffing wood\nsmoke and pines and soft wet Autumn leaves...",
    "The very motion of the\ncar would be soothing  that smooth effortless increase of speed...",
    "But it wouldnt he reflected suddenly be at all like that because owing\nto a slightly strained wrist Gerda would have to drive and Gerda God\nhelp her had never been able to begin to drive a car Every time she\nchanged gear he would sit silent grinding his teeth together\nmanaging not to say anything because he knew by bitter experience\nthat when he did say anything Gerda became immediately worse.",
    "Curious that no one had ever been able to teach Gerda to change gear\n not even Henrietta.",
    "Hed turned her over to Henrietta thinking that\nHenriettas enthusiasm might do better than his own irritability.",
    "For Henrietta loved cars.",
    "She spoke of cars with the lyrical intensity\nthat other people gave to Spring or the first snowdrop.",
    "Isnt he a beauty John Doesnt he just purr along For Henriettas\ncars were always masculine.",
    "Hell do Bale Hill in third  not straining at\nall  quite effortlessly.",
    "Listen to the even way he ticks over.",
    "Until he had burst out suddenly and furiously\n\nDont you think Henrietta you could pay some attention to me and\nforget the damned car for a minute or two\n\nHe was always ashamed of these outbursts.",
    "He never knew when they would come upon him out of a blue sky.",
    "It was the same thing over her work.",
    "He realized that her work was\ngood.",
    "He admired it  and hated it  at the same time.",
    "The most furious quarrel he had had with her had arisen over that.",
    "Gerda had said to him one day\n\nHenrietta has asked me to sit for her.",
    "What His astonishment had not if he came to think of it been\nflattering.",
    "You\n\nYes Im going over to the studio tomorrow.",
    "What on earth does she want you for\n\nNo he hadnt been very polite about it.",
    "But luckily Gerda hadnt\nrealized that fact.",
    "She had looked pleased about it.",
    "He suspected\nHenrietta of one of those insincere kindnesses of hers  Gerda\nperhaps had hinted that she would like to be modelled.",
    "Something of\nthat kind.",
    "Then about ten days later Gerda had shown him triumphantly a small\nplaster statuette.",
    "It was a pretty thing  technically skilful like all of Henriettas work.",
    "It\nidealized Gerda  and Gerda herself was clearly pleased about it.",
    "I really think its rather charming John.",
    "Is that Henriettas work It means nothing  nothing at all.",
    "I dont see\nhow she came to do a thing like that.",
    "Its different of course from her abstract work  but I think its good\nJohn I really do.",
    "He had said no more  after all he didnt want to spoil Gerdas\npleasure.",
    "But he tackled Henrietta about it at the first opportunity.",
    "What did you want to make that silly thing of Gerda for Its unworthy\nof you.",
    "After all you usually turn out decent stuff.",
    "Henrietta said slowly\n\nI didnt think it was bad.",
    "Gerda seemed quite pleased.",
    "Gerda was delighted.",
    "She would be.",
    "Gerda doesnt know art from a\ncoloured photograph.",
    "It wasnt bad art John.",
    "It was just a portrait statuette  quite harmless\nand not at all pretentious.",
    "You dont usually waste your time doing that kind of stuff \n\nHe broke off staring at a wooden figure about five feet high.",
    "Hullo whats this\n\nIts for the International Group.",
    "Pearwood.",
    "The Worshipper.",
    "She watched him.",
    "He stared and then  suddenly his neck swelled and\nhe turned on her furiously.",
    "So thats what you wanted Gerda for How dare you\n\nI wondered if youd see...\n\nSee it Of course I see it.",
    "Its here.",
    "He placed a finger on the broad\nheavy neck muscles.",
    "Henrietta nodded.",
    "Yes its the neck and shoulders I wanted  and that heavy forward\nslant  the submission  that bowed look.",
    "Its wonderful\n\nWonderful Look here Henrietta I wont have it.",
    "Youre to leave\nGerda alone.",
    "Gerda wont know.",
    "Nobody will know.",
    "You know Gerda would never\nrecognize herself here  nobody else would either.",
    "And it isnt Gerda.",
    "It\nisnt anybody.",
    "I recognized it didnt I\n\nYoure different John.",
    "You  see things.",
    "Its the damned cheek of it I wont have it Henrietta I wont have it.",
    "Cant you see that it was an indefensible thing to do\n\nWas it\n\nDont you know it was Cant you feel it was Wheres your usual\nsensitiveness\n\n\fHenrietta said slowly\n\nYou dont understand John.",
    "I dont think I could ever make you\nunderstand... You dont know what it is to want something  to look at it\nday after day  that line of the neck  those muscles  the angle where\nthe head goes forward  that heaviness round the jaw.",
    "Ive been\nlooking at them wanting them  every time I saw Gerda...",
    "In the end I\njust had to have them\n\nUnscrupulous\n\nYes I suppose just that.",
    "But when you want things in that way you just\nhave to take them.",
    "You mean you dont care a damn about anybody else.",
    "You dont care\nabout Gerda \n\nDont be stupid John.",
    "Thats why I made that statuette thing.",
    "To\nplease Gerda and make her happy.",
    "Im not inhuman\n\nInhuman is exactly what you are.",
    "Do you think  honestly  that Gerda would ever recognize herself in\nthis\n\nJohn looked at it unwillingly.",
    "For the first time his anger and\nresentment became subordinated to his interest.",
    "A strange submissive\nfigure a figure offering up worship to an unseen deity  the face raised\n blind dumb devoted  terribly strong terribly fanatical...",
    "He said\n\n\fThats rather a terrifying thing that you have made Henrietta\n\nHenrietta shivered slightly.",
    "She said Yes  I thought that...\n\nJohn said sharply\n\nWhats she looking at  who is it  there in front of her\n\nHenrietta hesitated.",
    "She said and her voice had a queer note in it \n\nI dont know.",
    "But I think  she might be looking at you John.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nIn the dining room the child Terence made another scientific\nstatement.",
    "Lead salts are more soluble in cold water than in hot.",
    "He looked expectantly at his mother but without any real hope.",
    "Parents in the opinion of young Terence were sadly disappointing.",
    "Did you know that Mother\n\nI dont know anything about chemistry dear.",
    "You could read about it in a book said Terence.",
    "It was a simple statement of fact but there was a certain wistfulness\nbehind it.",
    "Gerda did not hear the wistfulness.",
    "She was caught in the trap of her\nanxious misery.",
    "Round and round and round... She had been miserable\never since she woke up this morning and realized that at last this longdreaded weekend with the Angkatells was upon her.",
    "Staying at The\nHollow was always a nightmare to her.",
    "She always felt bewildered and\nforlorn.",
    "Lucy Angkatell with her sentences that were never finished\nher swift inconsequences and her obvious attempt at kindliness was\nthe figure she dreaded most.",
    "But the others were nearly as bad.",
    "For\nGerda it was two days of sheer martyrdom  to be endured for Johns\nsake.",
    "For John that morning as he stretched himself had remarked in\ntones of unmitigated pleasure\n\nSplendid to think well be getting into the country this weekend.",
    "It will\ndo you good Gerda just what you need.",
    "She had smiled mechanically and had said with unselfish fortitude It\nwill be delightful.",
    "Her unhappy eyes had wandered round the bedroom.",
    "The wallpaper\ncream striped with a black mark just by the wardrobe the mahogany\ndressing table with the glass that swung too far forward the cheerful\n\n\fbright blue carpet the water colours of the Lake district.",
    "All dear\nfamiliar things and she would not see them again until Monday.",
    "Instead tomorrow a housemaid who rustled would come into the\nstrange bedroom and put down a little dainty tray of early tea by the\nbed and pull up the blinds and would then rearrange and fold Gerdas\nclothes  a thing which made Gerda feel hot and uncomfortable all\nover.",
    "She would lie miserably enduring these things trying to comfort\nherself by thinking Only one morning more... Like being at school and\ncounting the days.",
    "Gerda had not been happy at school.",
    "At school there had been even\nless reassurance than elsewhere.",
    "Home had been better.",
    "But even\nhome had not been very good.",
    "For they had all of course been\nquicker and more clever than she was.",
    "Their comments quick\nimpatient not quite unkind had whistled about her ears like a\nhailstorm Oh do be quick Gerda.",
    "Butterfingers give it to me\nOh dont let Gerda do it shell be ages.",
    "Gerda never takes in\nanything...\n\nHadnt they seen all of them that that was the way to make her slower\nand more stupid still Shed got worse and worse more clumsy with\nher fingers more slowwitted more inclined to stare vacantly when\nsomething was said to her.",
    "Until suddenly she had reached the point where she had found a way\nout...",
    "Almost accidentally really she found her weapon of defence.",
    "She had grown slower still her puzzled stare had become even more\nblank.",
    "But now when they said impatiently Oh Gerda how stupid\n\n\fyou are dont you understand that she had been able behind her\nblank expression to hug herself a little in her secret knowledge... For\nshe wasnt quite as stupid as they thought... Often when she\npretended not to understand she did understand.",
    "And often\ndeliberately she slowed down in her task of whatever it was smiling to\nherself when someones impatient fingers snatched it away from her.",
    "For warm and delightful was a secret knowledge of superiority.",
    "She\nbegan to be quite often a little amused...",
    "Yes it was amusing to know\nmore than they thought you knew.",
    "To be able to do a thing but not let\nanybody know that you could do it.",
    "And it had the advantage suddenly discovered that people often did\nthings for you.",
    "That of course saved you a lot of trouble.",
    "And in the\nend if people got into the habit of doing things for you you didnt have\nto do them at all and then people didnt know that you did them badly.",
    "And so slowly you came round again almost to where you started.",
    "To\nfeeling that you could hold your own on equal terms with the world at\nlarge.",
    "But that wouldnt Gerda feared hold good with the Angkatells the\nAngkatells were always so far ahead that you didnt feel even in the\nsame street with them.",
    "How she hated the Angkatells It was good for\nJohn  John liked it there.",
    "He came home less tired  and sometimes\nless irritable.",
    "Dear John she thought.",
    "John was wonderful.",
    "Everyone thought so\nSuch a clever doctor so terribly kind to his patients.",
    "Wearing himself\nout  and the interest he took in his hospital patients  all that side of his\nwork that didnt pay at all.",
    "John was so disinterested  so truly noble.",
    "She had always known from the very first that John was brilliant and\nwas going to get to the top of the tree.",
    "And he had chosen her when\nhe might have married somebody far more brilliant.",
    "He had not minded\nher being slow and rather stupid and not very pretty.",
    "Ill look after\nyou he had said.",
    "Nicely rather masterfully.",
    "Dont worry about\nthings Gerda Ill take care of you...\n\nJust what a man ought to be.",
    "Wonderful to think John should have\nchosen her.",
    "He had said with that sudden very attractive half pleading smile of\nhis I like my own way you know Gerda\n\nWell that was all right.",
    "She had always tried to give in to him in\neverything.",
    "Even lately when he had been so difficult and nervy  when\nnothing seemed to please him.",
    "When somehow nothing she did was\nright.",
    "One couldnt blame him.",
    "He was so busy so unselfish \n\nOh dear that mutton She ought to have sent it back Still no sign of\nJohn... Why couldnt she sometimes decide right.",
    "Again those dark\nwaves of misery swept over her.",
    "The mutton This awful weekend with\nthe Angkatells She felt a sharp pain through both temples.",
    "Oh dear\nnow she was going to have one of her headaches.",
    "And it did so annoy\nJohn when she had headaches.",
    "He never would give her anything for\nthem when surely it would be so easy being a doctor.",
    "Instead he\nalways said Dont think about it.",
    "No use poisoning yourself with\ndrugs.",
    "Take a brisk walk.",
    "The mutton Staring at it Gerda felt the words repeating themselves in\nher aching head The mutton the MUTTON THE MUTTON...\n\nTears of selfpity sprang to her eyes.",
    "Why she thought does nothing\never go right for me\n\nTerence looked across the table at his mother and then at the joint He\nthought Why cant we have our dinner How stupid grown up people\nare.",
    "They havent any sense\n\nAloud he said in a careful voice\n\nNicholson Minor and I are going to make nitroglycerine in his fathers\nshrubbery They live at Streatham.",
    "Are you dear That will be very nice said Gerda.",
    "There was still time.",
    "If she rang the bell and told Lewis to take the joint\ndown now \n\nTerence looked at her with faint curiosity.",
    "He had felt instinctively that\nthe manufacture of nitroglycerine was not the kind of occupation that\nwould be encouraged by parents.",
    "With base opportunism he had\nselected a moment when he felt tolerable certain that he had a good\nchance of getting away with his statement.",
    "And his judgment had been\njustified.",
    "If by any chance there should be a fuss  if that is the\nproperties of nitroglycerine should manifest themselves too evidently\nhe would be able to say in an injured voice I told Mother...\n\nAll the same he felt vaguely disappointed.",
    "Even Mother he thought ought to know about nitroglycerine.",
    "He sighed.",
    "There swept over him that intense sense of loneliness that\nonly childhood can feel.",
    "His father was too impatient to listen his\nmother was too inattentive.",
    "Zena was only a silly kid...",
    "Pages of interesting chemical tests.",
    "And who cared about them\nNobody\n\nBang Gerda started.",
    "It was the door of Johns consulting room.",
    "It was\nJohn running upstairs.",
    "John Christow burst into the room bringing with him his own\nparticular atmosphere of intense energy.",
    "He was goodhumoured\nhungry impatient...\n\nGod he exclaimed as he sat down and energetically sharpened the\ncarving knife against the steel.",
    "how I hate sick people\n\nOh John.",
    "Gerda was quickly reproachful.",
    "Dont say things like that.",
    "Theyll think you mean it.",
    "She gestured slightly with her head towards the children.",
    "I do mean it said John Christow.",
    "Nobody ought to be ill.\n\nFathers joking said Gerda quickly to Terence.",
    "Terence examined his father with the dispassionate attention he gave\nto everything.",
    "I dont think he is he said.",
    "If you hated sick people you wouldnt be a doctor dear said Gerda\nlaughing gently.",
    "Thats exactly the reason said John Christow.",
    "No doctors like\nsickness.",
    "Good God this meats stone cold.",
    "Why on earth didnt you\nhave it sent down to keep hot\n\nWell dear I didnt know.",
    "You see I thought you were just coming \n\nJohn Christow pressed the bell a long irritated push.",
    "Lewis came\npromptly.",
    "Take this down and tell cook to warm it up.",
    "He spoke curtly.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Lewis slightly impertinent managed to convey in the two\ninnocuous words exactly her opinion of a mistress who sat at the\ndining table watching a joint of meat grow cold.",
    "Gerda went on rather incoherently\n\nIm so sorry dear its all my fault but first you see I thought you\nwere coming and then I thought well if I did send it back...\n\n\fJohn interrupted her impatiently.",
    "Oh what does it matter It isnt important.",
    "Not worth making a song\nand dance about.",
    "Then he asked\n\nIs the car here\n\nI think so.",
    "Collie ordered it.",
    "Then we can get away as soon as lunch is over.",
    "Across Albert Bridge he thought and then over Clapham Common the short cut by the Crystal Palace  Croydon  Purley Way then avoid\nthe main road  take that righthand fork up Metherly Hill  along\nHaverston Ridge  get suddenly right out of the suburban belt through\nConnerton and then up Shovel Down  trees golden red  woodland\nbelow one everywhere  the soft Autumn smell and down over the\ncrest of the hill...\n\nLucy and Henry... Henrietta...",
    "He hadnt seen Henrietta for four days.",
    "When he had last seen her\nhed been angry.",
    "Shed had that look in her eyes... Not abstracted not\ninattentive  he couldnt quite describe it  that look of seeing\nsomething  something that wasnt there  something and that was the\ncrux of it something that wasnt John Christow\n\n\fHe said to himself I know shes a sculptor.",
    "I know her works good.",
    "But damn it all cant she put it aside sometimes Cant she sometimes\nthink of me  and nothing else\n\nHe was unfair.",
    "He knew he was unfair.",
    "Henrietta seldom talked of her\nwork  was indeed less obsessed by it than most artists he knew.",
    "It was\nonly on very rare occasions that her absorption with some inner vision\nspoiled the completeness of her interest in him.",
    "But it always roused\nhis furious anger.",
    "Once he had said his voice sharp and hard Would\nyou give all this up if I asked you to\n\nAll  what Her warm voice held surprise.",
    "All  this.",
    "He waved a comprehensive hand round the studio.",
    "And immediately he thought to himself Fool Why did you ask her that\nAnd again Let her say Of course.",
    "Let her lie to me If shell only say\nOf course I will.",
    "It doesnt matter if she means it or not But let her\nsay it.",
    "I must have peace.",
    "Instead she had said nothing for some time.",
    "Her eyes had gone\ndreamy and abstracted.",
    "She had frowned a little.",
    "Then she had said slowly\n\nI suppose so.",
    "If it was necessary...",
    "Necessary What do you mean by necessary\n\n\fI dont really know what I mean by it John.",
    "Necessary as an\namputation might be necessary...",
    "Nothing short of a surgical operation in fact\n\nYou are angry.",
    "What did you want me to say\n\nYou know well enough.",
    "One word would have done.",
    "Yes.",
    "Why couldnt\nyou say it You say enough things to other people to please them\nwithout caring whether theyre true or not.",
    "Why not to me For Gods\nsake why not to me\n\nAnd still very slowly she had answered\n\nI dont know... really I dont know John.",
    "I cant  thats all.",
    "I cant.",
    "He had walked up and down for a minute or two.",
    "Then he had said\n\nYou will drive me mad Henrietta.",
    "I never feel that I have any influence\nover you at all.",
    "Why should you want to have\n\nI dont know but I do.",
    "He threw himself down on a chair.",
    "I want to come first.",
    "You do John.",
    "No.",
    "If I were dead the first thing youd do with the tears streaming\ndown your face would be to start modelling some damned mourning\nwoman or some figure of grief...",
    "I wonder.",
    "I believe  yes perhaps I would.",
    "Its rather horrible...\n\nShe had sat there looking at him with dismayed eyes \n\nThe pudding was burnt.",
    "Christow raised his eyebrows over it and\nGerda hurried into apologies.",
    "Im so sorry dear.",
    "I cant think why that should happen Its my fault.",
    "Give me the top and you take the underneath.",
    "The pudding was burnt because he John Christow had stayed sitting\nin his consulting room for a quarter of an hour after he needed to\nthinking about Henrietta and Mrs. Crabtree and letting ridiculous\nnostalgic feelings about San Miguel sweep over him.",
    "The fault was his.",
    "It was idiotic of Gerda to try and take the blame maddening of her to\ntry and eat the burnt part herself.",
    "Why did she always have to make a\nmartyr of herself Why did Terence stare at him in that slow\ninterested way Why oh why did Zena have to sniff so continually\nWhy were they all so damned irritating\n\nHis wrath fell on Zena.",
    "Why on earth dont you blow your nose\n\n\fShes got a little cold I think dear.",
    "No she hasnt.",
    "Youre always thinking they have colds Shes all\nright.",
    "Gerda sighed.",
    "She had never been able to understand why a doctor\nwho spent his time treating the ailments of others could be so\nindifferent to the health of his own family.",
    "He always ridiculed any\nsuggestion of illness.",
    "I sneezed eight times before lunch said Zena importantly.",
    "Heat sneeze said John.",
    "Its not hot said Terence.",
    "The thermometer in the hall is fiftyfive.",
    "John got up.",
    "Have we finished Good lets get on.",
    "Ready to start Gerda\n\nIn a minute John Ive just a few things to put in.",
    "Surely you could have done that before.",
    "What have you been doing all\nthe morning\n\nHe went out of the dining room fuming.",
    "Gerda had hurried off into her\nbedroom.",
    "Her anxiety to be quick would make her much slower.",
    "But\nwhy couldnt she have been ready His own suitcase was packed and\nin the hall.",
    "Why on earth \n\n\fZena was advancing on him clasping some rather sticky cards.",
    "Can I tell your fortune Daddy I know how.",
    "Ive told Mothers and\nTerrys and Lewiss and Janes and Cooks.",
    "All right \n\nHe wondered how long Gerda was going to be.",
    "He wanted to get away\nfrom this horrible house and this horrible street and this city full of\nailing sniffling diseased people.",
    "He wanted to get to woods and wet\nleaves  and the graceful aloofness of Lucy Angkatell who always gave\nyou the impression she hadnt even got a body.",
    "Zena was importantly dealing out cards.",
    "Thats you in the middle Father the King of Hearts.",
    "The person\nwhose fortunes told is always the King of Hearts.",
    "And then I deal the\nothers face down.",
    "Two on the left of you and two on the right of you\nand one over your head  that has power over you and one under your\nfeet  you have power over it.",
    "And this one  covers you\n\nNow Zena drew a deep breath.",
    "We turn them over.",
    "On the right of\nyou is the Queen of Diamonds  quite close.",
    "Henrietta he thought momentarily diverted and amused by Zenas\nsolemnity.",
    "And the next one is the Knave of Clubs  hes some quite young man \n\n\fOn the left of you is the eight of spades  thats a secret enemy.",
    "Have\nyou got a secret enemy Father\n\nNot that I know of.",
    "And beyond is the Queen of Spades  thats a much older lady.",
    "Lady Angkatell he said to himself.",
    "Now this is whats over your head and has power over you  the\nQueen of Hearts...\n\nVeronica he thought.",
    "Veronica And then What a fool I am Veronica\ndoesnt mean a thing to me now.",
    "And this is under your feet and you have power over it  the Queen of\nClubs...\n\nGerda hurried into the room.",
    "Im quite ready now John.",
    "Oh wait Mother wait Im telling Daddys fortune.",
    "Just the last card\nDaddy  the most important of all.",
    "The one that covers you.",
    "Zenas small sticky fingers turned it over.",
    "She gave a gasp.",
    "Oo  its the Ace of Spades Thats usually a death  but \n\n\fYour mother said John is going to run over someone on the way\nout of London.",
    "Come on Gerda.",
    "Goodbye you two.",
    "Try and behave.",

    "Oh Im all right.",
    "How delightful to be somewhere where no fat women\nare trying to get into clothes several sizes too small for them\n\nMust be dreadful Sir Henry paused and then said glancing down at\nhis wristwatch Edwards arriving by the 1215.",

    "But never of course noticing her very much\nbecause Henrietta was there...\n\n\fEdward always so retiring so very much of a visitor that she had been\nstartled one day when Tremlet the head gardener had said\n\nThe place will be Mr. Edwards some day.",
    "But why Tremlet Hes not Uncle Geoffreys son\n\nHes the heir Miss Midge.",
    "Entailed thats what they call it.",
    "Miss Lucy\nshes Mr. Geoffreys only child but she cant inherit because shes a\nfemale and Mr. Henry her husband hes only a second cousin.",
    "Not so\nnear as Mr. Edward.",
    "And now Edward lived at Ainswick.",
    "Lived there alone and very seldom\ncame away.",
    "Midge wondered sometimes if Lucy minded.",
    "Lucy always\nlooked as though she never minded about anything.",
    "Yet Ainswick had been her home and Edward was only her first cousin\nonce removed and over twenty years younger than she was.",
    "Her\nfather old Geoffrey Angkatell had been a great character in the\ncounty.",
    "He had had considerable wealth as well most of which had\ncome to Lucy so that Edward was a comparatively poor man with\nenough to keep the place up but not much over when that was done.",
    "Not that Edward had expensive tastes.",
    "He had been in the diplomatic\nservice for a time but when he inherited Ainswick he had resigned and\ncome to live on his property.",
    "He was of a bookish turn of mind collected first editions and\noccasionally wrote rather hesitating ironical little articles for obscure\n\n\freviews.",
    "He had asked his second cousin Henrietta Savernake three\ntimes to marry him.",
    "Midge sat in the Autumn sunshine thinking of these things.",
    "She could\nnot make up her mind whether she was glad she was going to see\nEdward or not.",
    "It was not as though she were what is called getting\nover it.",
    "One simply did not get over anyone like Edward.",
    "Edward at\nAinswick was just as real to her as Edward rising to greet her from a\nrestaurant table in London.",
    "She had loved Edward ever since she\ncould remember...\n\nSir Henrys voice recalled her\n\nHow do you think Lucy is looking\n\nVery well.",
    "Shes just the same as ever.",
    "Midge smiled a little.",
    "More\nso.",
    "Yees.",
    "Sir Henry drew on his pipe.",
    "He said unexpectedly\n\nSometimes you know Midge I get worried about Lucy.",
    "Worried Midge looked at him in surprise.",
    "Why Sir Henry shook\nhis head.",
    "Lucy he said doesnt realize that there are things that she cant\ndo.",
    "Midge stared.",
    "He went on\n\n\fShe gets away with things.",
    "She always has.",
    "He smiled.",
    "Shes\nflouted the traditions of Government House  shes played merry hell\nwith precedence at dinner parties and that Midge is a black crime.",
    "Shes put deadly enemies next to each other at the dinner table and\nrun riot over the Colour question And instead of raising one big\nalmighty row and setting everyone at loggerheads and bringing\ndisgrace on the British Raj  Im damned if she hasnt got away with it\nThat trick of hers  smiling at people and looking as though she\ncouldnt help it Servants are the same  she gives them any amount of\ntrouble and they adore her.",
    "I know what you mean said Midge thoughtfully.",
    "Things that you\nwouldnt stand from anyone else you feel are all right if Lucy does\nthem.",
    "What is it I wonder Charm Magnetism\n\nSir Henry shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Shes always been the same from a girl  only sometimes I feel its\ngrowing on her...",
    "I mean that she doesnt realize that there are limits.",
    "Why I really believe Midge he said amused that Lucy would feel\nshe could get away with murder\n\nHenrietta got the Delage out from the garage in the Mews and after a\nwholly technical conversation with her friend Albert who looked after\nthe Delage s health she started off.",
    "Running a treat Miss said Albert.",
    "Henrietta smiled.",
    "She shot away down the Mews savouring the\nunfailing pleasure she always felt when setting off in the car alone.",
    "She\nmuch preferred to be alone when driving.",
    "In that way she could realize\nto the full the intimate personal enjoyment that driving a car brought to\nher.",
    "She enjoyed her own skill in traffic she enjoyed nosing out new short\ncuts out of London.",
    "She had routes of her own and when driving in\nLondon itself had as intimate a knowledge of its streets as any taxi\ndriver.",
    "She now took her own newly discovered way southwest turning and\ntwisting through intricate mazes of suburban streets.",
    "When she finally came to the long ridge of Shovel Down it was half past\ntwelve.",
    "Henrietta had always loved the view from that particular place.",
    "She paused now just at the point where the road began to descend.",
    "All\naround and below her were trees trees whose leaves were turning\nfrom gold to brown.",
    "It was a world incredibly golden and splendid in\nthe strong Autumn sunlight.",
    "Henrietta thought I love Autumn.",
    "Its so much richer than Spring.",
    "And suddenly one of those moments of intense happiness came to her\n a sense of the loveliness of the world  of her own intense enjoyment\nof that world.",
    "She thought I shall never be as happy again as I am now... never...\n\n\fShe stayed there a minute gazing out over that golden world that\nseemed to swim and dissolve into itself hazy and blurred with its own\nbeauty...\n\nThen she came down over the crest of the hill down through the\nwoods down the long steep road to The Hollow.",
    "When Henrietta drove in Midge was sitting on the low wall of the\nterrace and waved to her cheerfully.",
    "Henrietta was pleased to see\nMidge whom she liked.",
    "Lady Angkatell came out of the house and said\n\nOh there you are Henrietta.",
    "When youve taken your car into the\nstables and given it a bran mash lunch will be ready.",
    "What a penetrating remark of Lucys said Henrietta as she drove\nround the house Midge accompanying her on the running board.",
    "You\nknow I always prided myself on having completely escaped the horsy\ntaint of my Irish forebears.",
    "When youve been brought up amongst\npeople who talk nothing but horse you go all superior about not caring\nfor them.",
    "And now Lucy has just shown me that I treat my car exactly\nlike a horse.",
    "Its quite true.",
    "I do.",
    "I know said Midge.",
    "Lucy is quite devastating.",
    "She told me this\nmorning that I was to be as rude as I liked whilst I was here.",
    "Henrietta considered this for a moment and then nodded.",
    "Of course she said.",
    "The shop\n\n\fYes.",
    "When one has to spend every day of ones life in a damnable little\nbox being polite to rude women calling them Madam pulling frocks\nover their heads smiling and swallowing their damned cheek\nwhatever they like to say to one  well one does want to cuss You\nknow Henrietta I always wonder why people think its so humiliating\nto go into service and that its grand and independent to be in a shop.",
    "One puts up with far more insolence in a shop than Gudgeon or\nSimmons or any decent domestic does.",
    "It must be foul darling.",
    "I wish you werent so grand and proud and\ninsistent on earning your own living...",
    "Anyway Lucys an angel.",
    "I shall be gloriously rude to everyone this\nweekend.",
    "Whos here said Henrietta as she got out of the car.",
    "The Christows are coming.",
    "Midge paused and then went on\nEdwards just arrived.",
    "Edward How nice I havent seen Edward for ages.",
    "Anybody else\n\nDavid Angkatell.",
    "That according to Lucy is where you are going to\ncome in useful.",
    "Youre going to stop him biting his nails.",
    "It sounds very unlike me said Henrietta.",
    "I hate interfering with\npeople and I wouldnt dream of checking their personal habits.",
    "What\ndid Lucy really say\n\n\fIt amounted to that Hes got an Adams apple too\n\nIm not expected to do anything about that am I asked Henrietta\nalarmed.",
    "And youre to be kind to Gerda.",
    "How I should hate Lucy if I were Gerda\n\nAnd someone who solves crimes is coming to lunch tomorrow.",
    "Were not going to play the Murder Game are we\n\nI dont think so.",
    "I think it is just neighbourly hospitality.",
    "Midges voice changed a little.",
    "Heres Edward coming out to hunt us.",
    "Dear Edward thought Henrietta with a sudden rush of warm\naffection.",
    "Edward Angkatell was very tall and thin.",
    "He was smiling now as he\ncame towards the two young women.",
    "Hullo Henrietta.",
    "I havent seen you for over a year.",
    "Hullo Edward.",
    "How nice Edward was That gentle smile of his the little creases at the\ncorners of his eyes.",
    "And all his nice knobbly bones...",
    "I believe its his\nbones I like so much thought Henrietta.",
    "The warmth of her affection\nfor Edward startled her.",
    "She had forgotten that she liked Edward so\nmuch...\n\nAfter lunch Edward said Come for a walk Henrietta.",
    "It was Edwards kind of walk  a stroll.",
    "They went up behind the house taking a path that zigzagged up\nthrough the trees.",
    "Like the woods at Ainswick thought Henrietta...\nDear Ainswick what fun they had had there She began to talk to\nEdward about Ainswick.",
    "They revived old memories.",
    "Do you remember our squirrel The one with the broken paw And we\nkept it in a cage and it got well\n\nOf course.",
    "It had a ridiculous name  what was it now\n\nCholmondeleyMajoribanks\n\nThats it.",
    "They both laughed.",
    "And old Mrs. Bondy the housekeeper  she always said it would go up\nthe chimney one day.",
    "And we were so indignant...\n\nAnd then it did...\n\nShe made it said Henrietta positively.",
    "She put the thought into the\nsquirrels head.",
    "She went on\n\nIs it all the same Edward Or is it changed I always imagine it as just\nthe same.",
    "Why dont you come and see Henrietta Its a long long time since\nyouve been there.",
    "I know...\n\nWhy she thought had she let so long a time go by\n\nOne got busy  interested  tangled up with people...\n\nYou know youre always welcome there at any time.",
    "How sweet you are Edward\n\nDear Edward she thought with his nice bones...",
    "He said presently\n\nIm glad youre fond of Ainswick Henrietta.",
    "She said dreamily Ainswick is the loveliest place in the world...\n\nA longlegged girl with a mane of untidy brown hair... happy girl with\nno idea at all of the things that life was going to do to her... a girl who\nloved trees...\n\nTo have been so happy and not to have known it If I could go back she\nthought...\n\nAnd aloud she said suddenly\n\nIs Ygdrasil still there\n\nIt was struck by lightning.",
    "Oh no not Ygdrasil\n\nShe was distressed.",
    "Ygdrasil  her own special name for the big oak\ntree.",
    "If the gods could strike down Ygdrasil then nothing was safe\nBetter not go back...\n\nDo you remember your special sign the Ygdrasil sign Edward\nasked.",
    "The funny tree like no tree that ever was I used to draw on bits of\npaper I still do Edward On blotters and on telephone books and on\nbridge scores.",
    "I doodle it all the time.",
    "Give me a pencil.",
    "He handed her a pencil and notebook and laughing she drew the\nridiculous tree.",
    "Yes he said thats Ygdrasil...",
    "They had come almost to the top of the path.",
    "Henrietta sat on a fallen\ntree trunk.",
    "Edward sat down beside her.",
    "She looked down through the trees.",
    "Its a little like Ainswick here  a kind of pocket Ainswick.",
    "Ive\nsometimes wondered  Edward do you think that that is why Lucy and\nHenry came here\n\nIts possible.",
    "One never knows said Henrietta slowly what goes on in Lucys\nhead.",
    "Then she asked What have you been doing with yourself\nEdward since I saw you last\n\nNothing Henrietta.",
    "That sounds very peaceful.",
    "Ive never been very good at  doing things.",
    "She threw him a quick\nglance.",
    "There had been something in his tone...",
    "But he was smiling at\nher quietly.",
    "And again she felt that rush of deep affection.",
    "Perhaps she said you are wise.",
    "Wise\n\nNot to do things...\n\nEdward said slowly Thats an odd thing for you to say Henrietta.",
    "You\nwhove been so successful.",
    "Do you think of me as successful How funny.",
    "But you are my dear.",
    "Youre an artist.",
    "You must be proud of yourself you cant help being.",
    "I know said Henrietta.",
    "A lot of people say that to me.",
    "They dont\nunderstand  they dont understand the first thing about it You dont\nEdward.",
    "Sculpture isnt a thing you set out to do and succeed in.",
    "Its a\nthing that gets at you that nags at you  and haunts you  so that\nsooner or later youve got to make terms with it.",
    "And then for a bit\nyou get some peace  until the whole thing starts over again.",
    "Do you want to be peaceful Henrietta\n\nSometimes I think I want to be peaceful more than anything in the\nworld Edward\n\nYou could be peaceful at Ainswick...",
    "I think you could be happy there.",
    "Even  even if you had to put up with me.",
    "What about it Henrietta\nWont you come to Ainswick and make it your home Its always been\nthere you know waiting for you.",
    "Henrietta turned her head slowly.",
    "She said in a low voice\n\n\fI wish I wasnt so dreadfully fond of you Edward.",
    "It makes it so very\nmuch harder to go on saying no.",
    "It is no then\n\nIm sorry.",
    "Youve said no before  but this time  well I thought it might be\ndifferent.",
    "Youve been happy this afternoon Henrietta.",
    "You cant deny\nthat.",
    "Ive been very happy.",
    "Your face even  its younger than it was this morning.",
    "I know.",
    "Weve been happy together talking about Ainswick thinking about\nAinswick.",
    "Dont you see what that means Henrietta\n\nIts you who dont see what it means Edward Weve been living all\nthis afternoon in the past.",
    "The past is sometimes a very good place to live.",
    "One cant go back.",
    "Thats the one thing one cant do  go back.",
    "He was silent for a minute or two.",
    "Then he said in a quiet pleasant and\nquite unemotional voice\n\n\fWhat you really mean is that you wont marry me because of John\nChristow.",
    "Henrietta did not answer and Edward went on\n\nThats it isnt it If there were no John Christow in the world you\nwould marry me.",
    "Henrietta said harshly I cant imagine a world in which there was no\nJohn Christow Thats what youve got to understand.",
    "If its like that why on earth doesnt the fellow get a divorce from his\nwife and then you could marry\n\nJohn doesnt want to get a divorce from his wife.",
    "And I dont know that\nI should want to marry John if he did.",
    "It isnt  it isnt in the least like you\nthink.",
    "Edward said in a thoughtful considering way John Christow...",
    "There\nare too many John Christows in this world...\n\nYoure wrong said Henrietta.",
    "There are very few people like\nJohn...",
    "If thats so  its a good thing At least thats what I think\n\nHe got up.",
    "Wed better go back again.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nAs they got into the car and Lewis shut the front door of the Harley\nStreet house Gerda felt the pang of exile go through her.",
    "That shut\ndoor was so final.",
    "She was barred out  this awful weekend was upon\nher.",
    "And there were things quite a lot of things that she ought to have\ndone before leaving.",
    "Had she turned off that tap in the bathroom And\nthat note for the laundry  shed put it  where had she put it Would the\nchildren be all right with Mademoiselle Mademoiselle was so  so would Terence for instance ever do anything that Mademoiselle told\nhim to French governesses never seemed to have any authority.",
    "She got into the driving seat still bowed down by misery and\nnervously pressed the starter.",
    "She pressed it again and again.",
    "John\nsaid.",
    "The car will start better Gerda if you switch on the engine.",
    "Oh dear how stupid of me.",
    "She shot a quick alarmed glance at him.",
    "If John was going to become annoyed straight away.",
    "But to her relief\nhe was smiling.",
    "Thats because thought Gerda with one of her flashes of acumen hes\nso pleased to be going to the Angkatells.",
    "Poor John he worked so hard His life was so unselfish so completely\ndevoted to others.",
    "No wonder he looked forward to this long weekend.",
    "And her mind harking back to the conversation at lunch she said as\nshe let in the clutch rather too suddenly so that the car leapt forward\nfrom the curb\n\n\fYou know John you really shouldnt make jokes about hating sick\npeople.",
    "Its wonderful of you to make light of all you do and I\nunderstand.",
    "But the children dont.",
    "Terry in particular has such a\nvery literal mind.",
    "There are times said John Christow when Terry seems to me\nalmost human  not like Zena How long do girls go on being a mass of\naffectation\n\nGerda gave a little quite sweet laugh.",
    "John she knew was teasing\nher.",
    "She stuck to her point.",
    "Gerda had an adhesive mind.",
    "I really think John that its good for children to realize the\nunselfishness and devotion of a doctors life.",
    "Oh God said Christow.",
    "Gerda was momentarily deflected.",
    "The traffic lights she was\napproaching had been green for a long time.",
    "They were almost sure\nshe thought to change before she got to them.",
    "She began to slow\ndown...",
    "Still green...\n\nJohn Christow forgot his resolutions of keeping silent about Gerdas\ndriving and said What are you stopping for\n\nI thought the lights might change \n\nShe pressed her foot on the accelerator the car moved forward a\nlittle just beyond the lights then unable to pick up the engine stalled.",
    "The lights changed.",
    "The cross traffic hooted angrily.",
    "John said but quite pleasantly\n\nYou really are the worst driver in the world Gerda\n\nI always find traffic lights so worrying.",
    "One doesnt know just when\nthey are going to change.",
    "John cast a quicksideways look at Gerdas anxious unhappy face.",
    "Everything worries Gerda he thought and tried to imagine what it\nmust feel like to live in that state.",
    "But since he was not a man of much\nimagination he could not picture it at all.",
    "You see Gerda stuck to her point Ive always impressed on the\nchildren just what a doctors life is  the selfsacrifice the dedication of\noneself to helping pain and suffering  the desire to serve others.",
    "Its\nsuch a noble life  and Im so proud of the way you give your time and\nenergy and never spare yourself \n\nJohn Christow interrupted her.",
    "Hasnt it ever occurred to you that I like doctoring  that its a\npleasure not a sacrifice Dont you realize that the damned things\ninteresting\n\n\fBut no he thought Gerda would never realize a thing like that If he\ntold her about Mrs. Crabtree and the Margaret Russell Ward she would\nonly see him as a kind of angelic helper of the Poor with a capital P.\n\nDrowning in treacle he said under his breath.",
    "What Gerda leaned towards him.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "If he were to tell Gerda that he was trying to find a cure for cancer\nshe would respond  she could understand a plain sentimental\nstatement.",
    "But she would never understand the peculiar fascination of\nthe intricacies of Ridgeways Disease  he doubted if he could even\nmake her understand what Ridgeways Disease actually was.",
    "Particularly he thought with a grin as were not really quite sure\nourselves We dont really know why the cortex degenerates\n\nBut it ocurred to him suddenly that Terence child though he was\nmight be interested in Ridgeways Disease.",
    "He had liked the way that\nTerence had eyed him appraisingly before stating I think Father does\nmean it...\n\nTerence had been out of favour the last few days for breaking the\nCona coffee machine  some nonsense about trying to make\nammonia... Ammonia Funny kid why should he want to make\nammonia Interesting in a way...\n\nGerda was relieved at Johns silence.",
    "She could cope with driving\nbetter if she were not distracted by conversation.",
    "Besides if John was\n\n\fabsorbed in thought he was not so likely to notice that jarring noise of\nher occasional forced changes of gear.",
    "She never changed down if\nshe could help it.",
    "There were times Gerda knew when she changed gear quite well\nthough never with confidence but it never happened if John were in\nthe car.",
    "Her nervous determination to do it right this time was always\ndisastrous her hand fumbled she accelerated too much or not\nenough and then she pushed the gear lever quickly and clumsily so\nthat it shrieked in protest.",
    "Stroke it in Gerda stroke it in Henrietta had pleaded once years\nago.",
    "Henrietta had demonstrated.",
    "Cant you feel the way it wants to\ngo  it wants to slide in  keep your hand flat till you get the feeling of it dont just push it anywhere  feel it.",
    "But Gerda had never been able to feel anything about a gear lever.",
    "If\nshe was pushing it more or less in the proper direction it ought to go\nin Cars ought to be made so that you didnt have that horrible grinding\nnoise.",
    "On the whole thought Gerda as she began the ascent of Mersham\nHill this drive wasnt going too badly.",
    "John was still absorbed in\nthought  and he hadnt noticed rather a bad crashing of gears in\nCroydon.",
    "Optimistically as the car gained speed she changed up into\nthird and immediately the car slackened.",
    "John as it were woke up.",
    "What on earths the point of changing up just when youre coming to\nthe steep bit\n\n\fGerda set her jaw.",
    "Not very much farther now.",
    "Not that she wanted to\nget there.",
    "No indeed shed much rather drive on for hours and hours\neven if John did lose his temper with her\n\nBut now they were driving along Shovel Down  flaming Autumn woods\nall round them.",
    "Wonderful to get out of London into this exclaimed John.",
    "Think of it\nGerda most afternoons were stuck in that dingy drawing room having\ntea  sometimes with the light on.",
    "The image of the somewhat dark drawing room of the flat rose up\nbefore Gerdas eyes with the tantalizing delight of a mirage.",
    "Oh if only\nshe could be sitting there now.",
    "The country looks lovely she said heroically.",
    "Down the steep hill  no\nescape now... That vague hope that something she didnt know what\nmight intervene to save her from the nightmare was unrealized.",
    "They\nwere there.",
    "She was a little comforted as she drove in to see Henrietta sitting on\na wall with Midge and a tall thin man.",
    "She felt a certain reliance on\nHenrietta who would sometimes unexpectedly come to the rescue if\nthings were getting very bad.",
    "John was glad to see Henrietta too...",
    "It seemed to him exactly the\nfitting journeys end to that lovely panorama of Autumn to drop down\nfrom the hilltop and find Henrietta waiting for him...\n\n\fShe had on the green tweed coat and skirt that he liked her in and\nwhich he thought suited her so much better than London clothes.",
    "Her\nlong legs were stuck out in front of her ending in wellpolished brown\nbrogues.",
    "They exchanged a quick smile  a brief recognition of the fact that each\nwas glad of the others presence.",
    "John didnt want to talk to Henrietta\nnow.",
    "He just enjoyed feeling that she was there  knowing that without\nher the weekend would be barren and empty.",
    "Lady Angkatell came out from the house and greeted them.",
    "Her\nconscience made her more effusive to Gerda than she would have\nbeen normally to any guest.",
    "But how very nice to see you Gerda Its been such a long time.",
    "And\nJohn\n\nThe idea was clearly that Gerda was the eagerly awaited guest and\nJohn the mere adjunct.",
    "It failed miserably of its object making Gerda\nstiff and uncomfortable.",
    "Lucy said You know Edward Edward Angkatell\n\nJohn nodded to Edward and said No I dont think so.",
    "The afternoon sun lighted up the gold of Johns hair and the blue of his\neyes.",
    "So might a Viking look who had just come ashore on a\nconquering mission.",
    "His voice warm and resonant charmed the ear\nand the magnetism of his whole personality took charge of the scene.",
    "That warmth and that objectiveness did no damage to Lucy.",
    "It set off\nindeed that curious elfin elusiveness of hers.",
    "It was Edward who\nseemed suddenly by contrast with the other man bloodless  a\nshadowy figure stooping a little...\n\nHenrietta suggested to Gerda that they should go and look at the\nkitchen garden.",
    "Lucy is sure to insist on showing us the rock garden and the Autumn\nborder she said as she led the way but I always think kitchen\ngardens are nice and peaceful.",
    "One can sit on the cucumber frames\nor go inside a greenhouse if its cold and nobody bothers one and\nsometimes theres something to eat.",
    "They found indeed some late peas which Henrietta ate raw but\nwhich Gerda did not much care for.",
    "She was glad to have got away\nfrom Lucy Angkatell whom she had found more alarming than ever.",
    "She began to talk to Henrietta with something like animation.",
    "The\nquestions Henrietta asked always seemed to be questions to which\nGerda knew the answers.",
    "After ten minutes Gerda felt very much\nbetter and began to think that perhaps the weekend wouldnt be so\nbad after all.",
    "Zena was going to dancing class now and had just had a new frock.",
    "Gerda described it at length.",
    "Also she had found a very nice new\nleathercraft shop.",
    "Henrietta asked whether it would be difficult to\nmake herself a handbag Gerda must show her.",
    "It was really very easy she thought to make Gerda look happy and\nwhat an enormous difference it made to her when she did look happy\n\nShe only wants to be allowed to curl up and purr thought Henrietta.",
    "They sat happily on the corner of the cucumber frames where the sun\nnow low in the sky gave an illusion of a Summer day.",
    "Then a silence fell.",
    "Gerdas face lost its expression of placidity.",
    "Her\nshoulders drooped.",
    "She sat there the picture of misery.",
    "She jumped\nwhen Henrietta spoke.",
    "Why do you come said Henrietta if you hate it so much\n\nGerda hurried into speech.",
    "Oh I dont I mean I dont know why you should think \n\nShe paused then went on It is really delightful to get out of London\nand Lady Angkatell is so very kind \n\nLucy Shes not a bit kind.",
    "Gerda looked faintly shocked.",
    "Oh but she is.",
    "Shes so very nice to me always.",
    "Lucy has good manners and she can be gracious.",
    "But she is rather a\ncruel person.",
    "I think really because she isnt quite human  she doesnt\nknow what its like to feel and think like ordinary people.",
    "And you are\n\n\fhating being here Gerda You know you are.",
    "And why should you\ncome if you feel like that\n\nWell you see John likes it \n\nOh John likes it all right.",
    "But you could let him come by himself.",
    "He wouldnt like that.",
    "He wouldnt enjoy it without me.",
    "John is so\nunselfish.",
    "He thinks it is good for me to get out into the country.",
    "The country is all right said Henrietta but theres no need to throw\nin the Angkatells.",
    "I  I  dont want you to feel that Im ungrateful.",
    "My dear Gerda why should you like us I always have thought the\nAngkatells were an odious family.",
    "We all like getting together and\ntalking an extraordinary language of our own.",
    "I dont wonder outside\npeople want to murder us.",
    "Then she added\n\nI expect its about teatime.",
    "Lets go back.",
    "She was watching Gerdas\nface as the latter got up and started to walk towards the house.",
    "Its\ninteresting thought Henrietta one portion of whose mind was always\ndetached to see exactly what a female Christian martyrs face looked\nlike before she went into the Arena...\n\nAs they left the walled kitchen garden they heard shots and Henrietta\nremarked\n\n\fSounds as though the massacre of the Angkatells had begun\n\nIt turned out to be Sir Henry and Edward discussing firearms and\nillustrating their discussion by firing revolvers.",
    "Henry Angkatells\nhobby was firearms and he had quite a collection of them.",
    "He had brought out several revolvers and some target cards and he\nand Edward were firing at them.",
    "Hullo Henrietta.",
    "Want to try if you could kill a burglar\n\nHenrietta took the revolver from him.",
    "Thats right  yes so aim like this.",
    "Bang\n\nMissed him said Sir Henry.",
    "You try Gerda.",
    "Oh I dont think I \n\nCome on Mrs. Christow.",
    "Its quite simple.",
    "Gerda fired the revolver flinching and shutting her eyes.",
    "The bullet\nwent even wider than Henriettas had done.",
    "Oo I want to do it said Midge strolling up.",
    "Its more difficult than youd think she remarked after a couple of\nshots.",
    "But its rather fun.",
    "Lucy came out from the house.",
    "Behind her came a tall sulky young\nman with an Adams apple.",
    "Heres David she announced.",
    "She took the revolver from Midge as her husband greeted David\nAngkatell reloaded it and without a word put three holes close to the\ncentre of the target.",
    "Well done Lucy exclaimed Midge.",
    "I didnt know shooting was one\nof your accomplishments.",
    "Lucy said Sir Henry gravely always kills her man\n\nThen he added reminiscently Came in useful once.",
    "Do you\nremember my dear those thugs that set upon us that day on the Asian\nside of the Bosporus I was rolling about with two of them on top of\nme feeling for my throat.",
    "And what did Lucy do asked Midge.",
    "Fired two shots into the melee.",
    "I didnt even know she had the pistol\nwith her.",
    "Got one bad man through the leg and the other in the\nshoulder.",
    "Nearest escape in the world Ive ever had.",
    "I cant think how\nshe didnt hit me.",
    "Lady Angkatell smiled at him.",
    "I think one always has to take some risk she said gently.",
    "And one\nshould do it quickly and not think too much about it.",
    "An admirable sentiment my dear said Sir Henry.",
    "But I have always\nfelt slightly aggrieved that I was the risk you took\n\nChapter 8\n\nAfter tea John said to Henrietta Come for a walk and Lady\nAngkatell said that she must show Gerda the rock garden though of\ncourse it was quite the wrong time of year.",
    "Walking with John thought Henrietta was as unlike walking with\nEdward as anything could be.",
    "With Edward one seldom did more than potter.",
    "Edward she thought\nwas a born potterer.",
    "Walking with John it was all she could do to keep\nup and by the time they got up to Shovel Down she said breathlessly\nIts not a Marathon John\n\nHe slowed down and laughed.",
    "Am I walking you off your feet\n\n\fI can do it  but is there any need We havent got a train to catch.",
    "Why do you have this ferocious energy Are you running away from\nyourself\n\nHe stopped dead.",
    "Why do you say that\n\nHenrietta looked at him curiously.",
    "I didnt mean anything particular by it.",
    "John went on again but walking more slowly.",
    "As a matter of fact he said Im tired.",
    "Im very tired.",
    "She heard the lassitude in his voice.",
    "Hows the Crabtree\n\nIts early days to say but I think Henrietta that Ive got the hang of\nthings.",
    "If Im right  his footsteps began to quicken  a lot of our ideas\nwill be revolutionised  well have to reconsider the whole question of\nhormone secretion \n\nYou mean that there will be a cure for Ridgeways Disease That\npeople wont die\n\nThat incidentally.",
    "What odd people doctors were thought Henrietta.",
    "Incidentally\n\n\fScientifically it opens up all sorts of possibilities\n\nHe drew a deep breath.",
    "But its good to get down here  good to get\nsome air into your lungs  good to see you.",
    "He gave her one of his\nsudden quick smiles And it will do Gerda good.",
    "Gerda of course simply loves coming to The Hollow\n\nOf course she does.",
    "By the way have I met Edward Angkatell\nbefore\n\nYouve met him twice said Henrietta dryly.",
    "I couldnt remember.",
    "Hes one of those vague indefinite people.",
    "Edwards a dear.",
    "Ive always been very fond of him.",
    "Well dont lets waste time on Edward None of these people count.",
    "Henrietta said in a low voice\n\nSometimes John  Im afraid for you\n\nAfraid for me  what do you mean\n\nHe turned an astonished face upon her.",
    "You are so oblivious  so  yes blind.",
    "Blind\n\n\fYou dont know  you dont see  youre curiously insensitive You dont\nknow what other people are feeling and thinking.",
    "I should have said just the opposite.",
    "You see what youre looking at yes.",
    "Youre  youre like a searchlight.",
    "A powerful beam turned onto the one spot where your interest is and\nbehind it and each side of it darkness\n\nHenrietta my dear what is all this\n\nIts dangerous John.",
    "You assume that everyone likes you that they\nmean well to you.",
    "People like Lucy for instance.",
    "Doesnt Lucy like me he said surprised.",
    "Ive always been\nextremely fond of her.",
    "And so you assume that she likes you.",
    "But Im not sure... And Gerda\nand Edward  or and Midge and Henry How do you know what they\nfeel towards you\n\nAnd Henrietta Do I know how she feels He caught her hand for a\nmoment.",
    "At least Im sure of you.",
    "She took her hand away.",
    "You can be sure of no one in this world John.",
    "His face had grown grave.",
    "No I wont believe that.",
    "Im sure of you and Im sure of myself.",
    "At least\n His face changed.",
    "What is it John\n\nDo you know what I found myself saying today Something quite\nridiculous.",
    "I want to go home.",
    "Thats what I said and I havent the least\nidea what I meant by it.",
    "Henrietta said slowly You must have had some picture in your\nmind...",
    "He said sharply Nothing.",
    "Nothing at all\n\nAt dinner that night Henrietta was put next to David and from the end\nof the table Lucys delicate eyebrows telegraphed  not a command Lucy never commanded  but an appeal.",
    "Sir Henry was doing his best with Gerda and succeeding quite well.",
    "John his face amused was following the leaps and bounds of Lucys\ndiscursive mind.",
    "Midge talked in rather a stilted way to Edward who\nseemed more absentminded than usual.",
    "David was glowering and crumbling his bread with a nervous hand.",
    "David had come to The Hollow in a spirit of considerable\nunwillingness.",
    "Until now he had never met either Sir Henry or Lady\nAngkatell and disapproving of the Empire generally he was prepared\n\n\fto disapprove of these relatives of his.",
    "Edward whom he did know he\ndespised as a dilettante.",
    "The remaining four guests he examined with\na critical eye.",
    "Relations he thought were pretty awful and one was\nexpected to talk to people a thing which he hated doing.",
    "Midge and Henrietta he discounted as emptyheaded.",
    "This Dr.\nChristow was just one of these Harley Street charlatans  all manner\nand social success  his wife obviously did not count.",
    "David shifted his neck in his collar and wished fervently that all these\npeople could know how little he thought of them They were really all\nquite negligible.",
    "When he had repeated that three times to himself he felt rather better.",
    "He still glowered but he was able to leave his bread alone.",
    "Henrietta though responding loyally to the eyebrows had some\ndifficulty in making headway.",
    "Davids curt rejoinders were snubbing in\nthe extreme.",
    "In the end she had recourse to a method she had\nemployed before with the tonguetied young.",
    "She\n\nmade\n\ndeliberately\n\na\n\ndogmatic\n\nand\n\nquite\n\nunjustifiable\n\npronouncement on a modern composer knowing that David had much\ntechnical musical knowledge.",
    "To her amusement the plan worked.",
    "David drew himself up from his\nslouching position where he had been more or less reclining on his\nspine.",
    "His voice was no longer low and mumbling.",
    "He stopped\ncrumbling his bread.",
    "That he said in loud clear tones fixing a cold eye on Henrietta\nshows that you dont know the first thing about the subject\n\nFrom then on until the end of dinner he lectured her in clear and biting\naccents and Henrietta subsided into the proper meekness of one\ninstructed.",
    "Lucy Angkatell sent a benignant glance down the table and Midge\ngrinned to herself.",
    "So clever of you darling murmured Lady Angkatell as she slipped\nan arm through Henriettas on the way to the drawingroom.",
    "What an\nawful thought it is that if people had less in their heads they would\nknow better what to do with their hands Do you think hearts or bridge\nor rummy or something terribly terribly simple like animal grab\n\nI think David would be rather insulted by animal grab.",
    "Perhaps you are right.",
    "Bridge then.",
    "I am sure he will feel that bridge\nis rather worthless and then he can have a nice glow of contempt for\nus.",
    "They made up two tables.",
    "Henrietta played with Gerda against John\nand Edward.",
    "It was not her idea of the best grouping.",
    "She had wanted\nto segregate Gerda from Lucy and if possible from John also  but John\nhad shown determination.",
    "And Edward had then forestalled Midge.",
    "The atmosphere was not Henrietta thought quite comfortable but\nshe did not quite know from whence the discomfort arose.",
    "Anyway if\nthe cards gave them anything like a break she intended that Gerda\n\n\fshould win.",
    "Gerda was not really a bad bridge player  away from John\nshe was quite average  but she was a nervous player with bad\njudgment and with no real knowledge of the value of her hand.",
    "John\nwas a good if slightly overconfident player.",
    "Edward was a very good\nplayer indeed.",
    "The evening wore on and at Henriettas table they were still playing the\nsame rubber.",
    "The scores rose above the line on either side.",
    "A curious\ntensity had come into the play of which only one person was unaware.",
    "To Gerda this was just a rubber of bridge which she happened for\nonce to be quite enjoying.",
    "She felt indeed a pleasurable excitement.",
    "Difficult decisions had been unexpectedly eased by Henriettas overcalling her own bids and playing the hand.",
    "Those moments when John unable to refrain from that critical attitude\nwhich did more to undermine Gerdas selfconfidence than he could\npossibly have imagined exclaimed Why on earth did you lead that\nclub Gerda were countered almost immediately by Henriettas swift\nNonsense John of course she had to lead the club It was the only\npossible thing to do.",
    "Finally with a sigh Henrietta drew the score towards her.",
    "Game and\nrubber but I dont think we shall make much out of it Gerda.",
    "John said A lucky finesse in a cheerful voice.",
    "Henrietta looked up sharply.",
    "She knew his tone.",
    "She met his eyes and\nher own dropped\n\n\fShe got up and went to the mantelpiece and John followed her.",
    "He said\nconversationally You dont always look deliberately into peoples\nhands do you\n\nHenrietta said calmly Perhaps I was a little obvious.",
    "How despicable\nit is to want to win at games\n\nYou wanted Gerda to win the rubber you mean.",
    "In your desire to give\npleasure to people you dont draw the line at cheating.",
    "How horribly you put things And you are always quite right.",
    "Your wishes seemed to be shared by my partner.",
    "So he had noticed thought Henrietta.",
    "She had wondered herself if she\nhad been mistaken.",
    "Edward was so skillful  there was nothing you\ncould have taken hold of.",
    "A failure once to call the game.",
    "A lead that\nhad been sound and obvious  but when a less obvious lead would have\nassured success.",
    "It worried Henrietta... Edward she knew would never play his cards in\norder that she Henrietta might win.",
    "He was far too imbued with\nEnglish sportsmanship for that.",
    "No he thought it was just any more\nsuccess for John Christow that he was unable to endure...\n\nShe felt suddenly keyed up alert.",
    "She didnt like this party of Lucys.",
    "And then dramatically unexpectedly with the unreality of a stage\nentrance.",
    "Veronica Cray came through the window\n\n\fThe French windows had been pushed to not closed for the evening\nwas warm.",
    "Veronica pushed them wide came through them and stood\nthere framed against the night smiling a little rueful wholly charming\nwaiting just that infinitesimal moment before speaking so that she\nmight be sure of her audience.",
    "You must forgive me  bursting in upon you this way.",
    "Im your\nneighbour Lady Angkatell  from that ridiculous cottage Dovecotes and the most frightful catastrophe has occurred\n\nHer smile broadened  became more humorous.",
    "Not a match Not a single match in the house And Saturday evening.",
    "So stupid of me.",
    "But what could I do I came along here to beg help\nfrom my only neighbour within miles.",
    "Nobody spoke for a moment for Veronica had rather that effect.",
    "She\nwas lovely  not quietly lovely not even dazzlingly lovely  but so\nefficiently lovely that it made you gasp The waves of pale shimmering\nhair the curving mouth  the platinum foxes that swathed her\nshoulders and the long sweep of white velvet underneath them...\n\nShe was looking from one to the other of them humorous charming\n\nAnd I smoke she said like a chimney And my lighter wont work\nAnd besides theres breakfast  gas stoves  She thrust out her\nhands.",
    "I do feel such a complete fool.",
    "Lucy came forward gracious faintly amused.",
    "Why of course  she began but Veronica Cray interrupted.",
    "She was looking at John Christow.",
    "An expression of utter amazement\nof incredulous delight was spreading over her face.",
    "She took a step\ntowards him hands outstretched.",
    "Why surely  John Its John Christow Now isnt that too\nextraordinary I havent seen you for years and years and years And\nsuddenly  to find you here\n\nShe had his hands in hers by now.",
    "She was all warmth and simple\neagerness.",
    "She half turned her head to Lady Angkatell.",
    "This is just the most wonderful surprise.",
    "Johns an old old friend of\nmine.",
    "Why.",
    "Johns the first man I ever loved I was crazy about you\nJohn.",
    "She was half laughing now  a woman moved by the ridiculous\nremembrance of young love.",
    "I always thought John was just wonderful\n\nSir Henry courteous and polished had moved forward to her.",
    "She must have a drink.",
    "He manoeuvred glasses.",
    "Lady Angkatell said\n\nMidge dear ring the bell.",
    "When Gudgeon came Lucy said\n\n\fA box of matches Gudgeon  at least has cook got plenty\n\nA new dozen came in today mlady.",
    "Then bring in half a dozen.",
    "Gudgeon.",
    "Oh no Lady Angkatell  just one\n\nVeronica protested laughing she had her drink now and was smiling\nround at everyone.",
    "John Christow said\n\nThis is my wife.",
    "Veronica.",
    "Oh but how lovely to meet you.",
    "Veronica beamed upon Gerdas air\nof bewilderment.",
    "Gudgeon brought in the matches stacked on a silver salver.",
    "Lady Angkatell indicated Veronica Cray with a gesture and he brought\nthe salver to her.",
    "Oh dear Lady Angkatell not all these\n\nLucys gesture was negligently royal.",
    "Its so tiresome having only one of a thing.",
    "We can spare them quite\neasily.",
    "Sir Henry was saying pleasantly\n\n\fAnd how do you like living at Dovecotes\n\nI adore it.",
    "Its wonderful here near London and yet one feels so\nbeautifully isolated.",
    "Veronica put down her glass.",
    "She drew the platinum foxes a little\ncloser round her.",
    "She smiled on them all.",
    "Thank you so much Youve been so kind  the words floated between\nSir Henry and Lady Angkatell and for some reason Edward.",
    "I shall\nnow carry home the spoils.",
    "John she gave him an artless friendly\nsmile you must see me safely back because I want dreadfully to hear\nall youve been doing in the years and years since Ive seen you.",
    "It\nmakes me feel of course dreadfully old...\n\nShe moved to the window and John Christow followed\n\nIm so dreadfully sorry to have bothered you in this stupid way...",
    "Thank you so much Lady Angkatell.",
    "She went out with John.",
    "Sir Henry stood by the window looking after\nthem.",
    "Quite a fine warm night he said.",
    "Lady Angkatell yawned.",
    "Oh dear she murmured we must go to bed.",
    "Henry we must go\nand see one of her pictures.",
    "Im sure from tonight she must give a\nlovely performance.",
    "They went upstairs.",
    "Midge saying good night asked Lucy\n\nA lovely performance\n\nDidnt you think so darling\n\nI gather Lucy that you think its just possible she may have some\nmatches in Dovecotes all the time.",
    "Dozens of boxes I expect darling.",
    "But we mustnt be uncharitable.",
    "And it was a lovely performance\n\nDoors were shutting all down the corridor voices were murmuring\ngood nights.",
    "Sir Henry said Ill leave the window for Christow.",
    "His\nown door shut.",
    "Henrietta said to Gerda What fun actresses are.",
    "They make such\nmarvellous entrances and exits She yawned and added Im\nfrightfully sleepy.",
    "Veronica Cray moved swiftly along the narrow path through the\nchestnut woods.",
    "She came out from the woods to the open space by the swimming pool.",
    "There was a small pavilion here where the Angkatells sat on days that\nwere sunny but when there was a cold wind.",
    "Veronica Cray stood still.",
    "She turned and faced John Christow.",
    "Then she laughed.",
    "With her hand she gestured towards the leafstrewn\nsurface of the swimming pool.",
    "Not quite like the Mediterranean is it John she said.",
    "He knew then what he had been waiting for  knew that in all those\nfifteen years of separation from Veronica she had still been with him.",
    "The blue sea the scent of mimosa the hot dust  pushed down thrust\nout of sight but never really forgotten...",
    "They all meant one thing Veronica.",
    "He was a young man of twentyfour desperately and\nagonizingly in love and this time he was not going to run away...\n\nChapter 9\n\nJohn Christow came out from the chestnut woods onto the green slope\nby the house.",
    "There was a moon and the house basked in the\nmoonlight with a strange innocence in its curtained windows.",
    "He\nlooked down at the wristwatch he wore.",
    "It was three oclock.",
    "He drew a deep breath and his face was anxious.",
    "He was no longer even remotely a young man of twentyfour in love.",
    "He was a shrewd practical man of just on forty and his mind was clear\nand levelheaded.",
    "Hed been a fool of course a complete damned fool but he didnt\nregret that For he was he now realized completely master of himself.",
    "It was as though for years he had dragged a weight upon his leg  and\nnow the weight was gone.",
    "He was free.",
    "He was free and himself John Christow  and he knew that to John\nChristow successful Harley Street specialist Veronica Cray meant\nnothing whatsoever.",
    "All that had been in the past  and because that\nconflict had never been resolved because he had always suffered\nhumiliatingly from the fear that he had in plain language run away\nVeronicas image had never completely left him.",
    "She had come to him\ntonight out of a dream... and he had accepted the dream and now\nthank God he was delivered from it for ever.",
    "He was back in the\npresent  and it was 300 a.m. and it was just possible that he had\nmucked up things rather badly.",
    "Hed been with Veronica for three hours.",
    "She had sailed in like a\nfrigate and cut him out of the circle and carried him off as her prize\nand he wondered now what on earth everybody had thought about it.",
    "What for instance would Gerda think\n\nAnd Henrietta But he didnt care quite so much about Henrietta.",
    "He\ncould he felt at a pinch explain to Henrietta.",
    "He could never explain to\nGerda.",
    "And he didnt definitely he didnt want to lose anything.",
    "All his life he had been a man who took a justifiable amount of risks.",
    "Risks with patients risks with treatment risks with investments.",
    "Never\na fantastic risk  only the kind of risk that was just beyond the margin of\nsafety.",
    "If Gerda guessed  if Gerda had the least suspicion.",
    "But would she have How much did he really know about Gerda\nNormally Gerda would believe white was black if he told her so.",
    "But\nover a thing like this...\n\nWhat had he looked like when he followed Veronicas tall triumphant\nfigure out of that window What had he shown in his face Had they\nseen a boys dazed lovesick face Or had they only observed a man\ndoing a polite duty He didnt know He hadnt the least idea.",
    "But he was afraid  afraid for the ease and order and safety of his life.",
    "Hed been mad  quite mad he thought with exasperation  and then\ntook comfort in that very thought.",
    "Nobody would believe surely he\ncould have been as mad as that\n\nEverybody was in bed and asleep that was clear.",
    "The French window\nof the drawingroom stood half open left for his return.",
    "He looked up\nagain at the innocent sleeping house.",
    "It looked somehow too\ninnocent.",
    "Suddenly he started.",
    "He had heard or he had imagined he heard the\nfaint closing of a door.",
    "He turned his head sharply.",
    "If someone had come down to the pool\nfollowing him there.",
    "If someone had waited and followed him back that\nsomeone could have taken a higher path and so gained entrance to the\nhouse again by the side garden door and the soft closing of the garden\ndoor would have made just the sound that he had heard.",
    "He looked up sharply at the windows.",
    "Was that curtain moving had it\nbeen pushed aside for someone to look out and then allowed to fall\nHenriettas room...\n\nHenrietta Not Henrietta his heart cried in a sudden panic.",
    "I cant lose\nHenrietta\n\nHe wanted suddenly to fling up a handful of pebbles at her window to\ncry out to her.",
    "Come out my dear love.",
    "Come out to me now and walk with me up\nthrough the woods to Shovel Down and there listen  listen to\neverything that I now know about myself and that you must know too.",
    "If you do not know it already...",
    "He wanted to say to Henrietta\n\nI am starting again.",
    "A new life begins from today.",
    "The things that\ncrippled and hindered me from living have fallen away.",
    "You were right\nthis afternoon when you asked me if I was running away from myself.",
    "That is what I have been doing for years.",
    "Because I never knew\nwhether it was strength or weakness that took me away from\nVeronica I have been afraid of myself afraid of life afraid of you.",
    "If he were to wake Henrietta and make her come out with him now  up\nthrough the woods to where they could watch together the sun come\nup over the rim of the world...\n\nYoure mad he said to himself.",
    "He shivered.",
    "It was cold now late\nSeptember after all.",
    "What the devil is the matter with you he asked\n\n\fhimself.",
    "Youve behaved quite insanely enough for one night.",
    "If you\nget away with it as it is youre damned lucky What on earth would\nGerda think if he stayed out all night and came home with the milk\n\nWhat for the matter of that would the Angkatells think\n\nBut that did not worry him for a moment.",
    "The Angkatells took\nGreenwich time as it were from Lucy Angkatell.",
    "And to Lucy\nAngkatell the unusual always appeared perfectly reasonable.",
    "But Gerda unfortunately was not an Angkatell.",
    "Gerda would have to be dealt with and hed better go in and deal with\nGerda as soon as possible.",
    "Supposing it had been Gerda who had followed him tonight.",
    "No good\nsaying people didnt do such things.",
    "As a doctor he knew only too well\nwhat people highminded sensitive fastidious honourable people\nconstantly did.",
    "They listened at doors and opened letters and spied\nand snooped  not because for one moment they approved of such\nconduct but because before the sheer necessity of human anguish\nthey were rendered desperate.",
    "Poor devils he thought poor suffering human devils... John Christow\nknew a good deal about human suffering.",
    "He had not very much pity\nfor weakness but he had for suffering for it was he knew the strong\nwho suffer...",
    "If Gerda knew.",
    "Nonsense he said to himself why should she Shes\ngone up to bed and shes fast asleep.",
    "Shes no imagination never has\nhad.",
    "He went in through the French windows switched on a lamp closed\nand locked the windows.",
    "Then switching off the light he left the room\nfound the switch in the hall went quickly and lightly up the stairs.",
    "A\nsecond switch turned off the hall light.",
    "He stood for a moment by the\nbedroom door his hand on the doorknob then he turned it and went\nin.",
    "The room was dark and he could hear Gerdas even breathing.",
    "She\nstirred as he came in and closed the door.",
    "Her voice came to him\nblurred and indistinct with sleep\n\nIs that you John\n\nYes.",
    "Arent you very late What time is it\n\nHe said easily\n\nIve no idea.",
    "Sorry I woke you up.",
    "I had to go in with the woman and\nhave a drink.",
    "He made his voice sound bored and sleepy.",
    "Gerda murmured Oh Good night John.",
    "There was a rustle as she turned over in bed.",
    "It was all right As usual hed been lucky... As usual  just for a moment\nit sobered him the thought of how often his luck had held Time and\nagain there had been a moment when hed held his breath and said If\nthis goes wrong... And it hadnt gone wrong But some day surely his\nluck would change...",
    "He undressed quickly and got into bed.",
    "Funny that kids fortune\ntelling.",
    "And this one is over your head and has power over you...\nVeronica And she had had power over him all right.",
    "But not any more my girl he thought with a kind of savage\nsatisfaction.",
    "All thats over.",
    "Im quit of you now\n\nChapter 10\n\nIt was ten oclock the next morning when John came down.",
    "Breakfast\nwas on the sideboard.",
    "Gerda had had her breakfast sent up to her in\nbed and had been rather perturbed since perhaps she might be\ngiving trouble.",
    "Nonsense John had said.",
    "People like the Angkatells who still\nmanaged to have butlers and servants might just as well give them\nsomething to do.",
    "He felt very kindly towards Gerda this morning.",
    "All that nervous\nirritation that had so fretted him of late seemed to have died down and\ndisappeared.",
    "Sir Henry and Edward had gone out shooting Lady Angkatell told him.",
    "She herself was busy with a gardening basket and gardening gloves.",
    "He stayed talking to her for a while until Gudgeon approached him with\na letter on a salver.",
    "This has just come by hand sir.",
    "He took it with slightly raised eyebrows.",
    "Veronica\n\nHe strolled into the library tearing it open.",
    "Please come over this morning.",
    "I must see you.",
    "Veronica.",
    "Imperious as ever he thought Hed a good mind not to go.",
    "Then he\nthought he might as well and get it over.",
    "Hed go at once.",
    "He took the path opposite the library window passed by the swimming\npool which was a kind of nucleus with paths radiating from it in every\ndirection one up the hill to the woods proper one from the flower walk\nabove the house one from the farm and the one that led on to the lane\nwhich he took now.",
    "A few yards up the lane was the cottage called Dovecotes.",
    "Veronica was waiting for him.",
    "She spoke from the window of the\npretentious halftimbered building.",
    "Come inside John.",
    "Its cold this morning.",
    "There was a fire lit in the sitting room which was furnished in offwhite\nwith pale cyclamen cushions.",
    "Looking at her this morning with an appraising eye he saw the\ndifferences there were from the girl he remembered as he had not\nbeen able to see them last night.",
    "Strictly speaking he thought she was more beautiful now than then.",
    "She understood her beauty better and she cared for it and enhanced\nit in every way.",
    "Her hair which had been deep golden was now a\nsilvery platinum colour.",
    "Her eyebrows were different giving much\nmore poignancy to her expression.",
    "Hers had never been a mindless beauty.",
    "Veronica he remembered\nhad qualified as one of our intellectual actresses.",
    "She had a\nuniversity degree and had had views on Strindberg and on\nShakespeare.",
    "He was struck now with what had been only dimly apparent to him in\nthe past  that she was a woman whose egoism was quite abnormal.",
    "Veronica was accustomed to getting her own way and beneath the\nsmooth beautiful contours of flesh he seemed to sense an ugly iron\ndetermination.",
    "I sent for you said Veronica as she handed him a box of cigarettes\nbecause weve got to talk.",
    "Weve got to make arrangements.",
    "For our\nfuture I mean.",
    "He took a cigarette and lighted it.",
    "Then he said quite pleasantly\n\nBut have we a future\n\nShe gave him a sharp glance.",
    "What do you mean John Of course we have got a future.",
    "Weve\nwasted fifteen years.",
    "Theres no need to waste any more time.",
    "He sat down.",
    "Im sorry Veronica.",
    "But Im afraid youve got all this taped out wrong.",
    "Ive  enjoyed meeting you again very much.",
    "But your life and mine\ndont touch anywhere.",
    "They are quite divergent.",
    "Nonsense John.",
    "I love you and you love me.",
    "Weve always loved each\nother.",
    "You were incredibly obstinate in the past But never mind that\nnow.",
    "Our lives neednt clash.",
    "I dont mean to go back to the States.",
    "When Ive finished this picture Im working on now Im going to play a\nstraight part on the London stage.",
    "Ive got a wonderful play  Eldertons\nwritten it for me.",
    "It will be a terrific success.",
    "Im sure it will he said politely.",
    "And you can go on being a doctor.",
    "Her voice was kind and\ncondescending.",
    "Youre quite well known they tell me.",
    "My dear girl Im married.",
    "Ive got children.",
    "Im married myself at the moment said Veronica.",
    "But all these\nthings are easily arranged.",
    "A good lawyer can fix up everything.",
    "She\nsmiled at him dazzlingly.",
    "I always did mean to marry you darling.",
    "I\ncant think why I have this terrible passion for you but there it is\n\nIm sorry Veronica but no good lawyer is going to fix up anything.",
    "Your life and mine have nothing to do with each other.",
    "Not after last night\n\nYoure not a child Veronica.",
    "Youve had a couple of husbands and by\nall accounts several lovers.",
    "What does last night mean actually\nNothing at all and you know it.",
    "Oh my dear John  she was still amused indulgent.",
    "If youd seen\nyour face  there in that stuffy drawingroom You might have been in\nSan Miguel again\n\nJohn sighed.",
    "He said\n\nI was in San Miguel...",
    "Try to understand Veronica.",
    "You came to me\nout of the past.",
    "Last night I too was in the past but today  todays\ndifferent.",
    "Im a man fifteen years older.",
    "A man you dont even know and whom I daresay you wouldnt like much if you did know.",
    "You prefer your wife and children to me\n\nShe was genuinely amazed.",
    "Odd as it may seem to you I do.",
    "Nonsense John you love me.",
    "Im sorry Veronica.",
    "She said incredulously\n\nYou dont love me\n\nIts better to be quite clear about these things.",
    "You are an\nextraordinarily beautiful woman Veronica but I dont love you.",
    "She sat so still that she might have been a waxwork.",
    "That stillness of\nhers made him just a little uneasy.",
    "When she spoke it was with such venom that he recoiled.",
    "Who is she\n\nShe Who do you mean\n\nThat woman by the mantelpiece last night\n\nHenrietta he thought.",
    "How the devil did she get on to Henrietta Aloud\nhe said\n\n\fWho are you talking about Midge Hardcastle\n\nMidge Thats the square dark girl isnt it No I dont mean her.",
    "And I\ndont mean your wife.",
    "I mean that insolent devil who was leaning\nagainst the mantelpiece Its because of her that youre turning me\ndown Oh dont pretend to be so moral about your wife and children.",
    "Its that other woman.",
    "She got up and came towards him.",
    "Dont you understand John that ever since I came back to England\neighteen months ago Ive been thinking about you Why do you\nimagine I took this idiotic place here Simply because I found out that\nyou often came down for weekends with the Angkatells\n\nSo last night was all planned Veronica\n\nYou belong to me John.",
    "You always have\n\nI dont belong to anyone Veronica Hasnt life taught you even now\nthat you cant own other human beings body and soul I loved you\nwhen I was a young man.",
    "I wanted you to share my life.",
    "You wouldnt\ndo it\n\nMy life and career were much more important than yours Anyone can\nbe a doctor\n\nHe lost his temper a little.",
    "Are you quite as wonderful as you think you are\n\nYou mean that I havent got to the top of the tree.",
    "I shall I shall\n\nJohn Christow looked at her with a sudden quite dispassionate\ninterest.",
    "I dont believe you know that you will... Theres a lack in you\nVeronica.",
    "Youre all grab and snatch  no real generosity  I think thats\nit...\n\nVeronica got up.",
    "She said in a quiet voice\n\nYou turned me down fifteen years ago... Youve turned me down again\ntoday.",
    "Ill make you sorry for this.",
    "John got up and went to the door.",
    "Im sorry Veronica if Ive hurt you.",
    "Youre very lovely my dear and I\nonce loved you very much.",
    "Cant we leave it at that\n\nGoodbye John.",
    "Were not leaving it at that.",
    "Youll find that out all\nright.",
    "I think  I think I hate you more than I believed I could hate\nanyone.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "John walked back slowly through the wood.",
    "When he got to the\nswimming pool he sat down on the bench there.",
    "He had no regrets for\nhis treatment of Veronica.",
    "Veronica he thought dispassionately was a\nnasty bit of work.",
    "She always had been a nasty bit of work and the best\nthing he had ever done was to get clear of her in time.",
    "God alone knew\nwhat would have happened to him by now if he hadnt\n\nAs it was he had that extraordinary sensation of starting a new life\nunfettered and unhampered by the past.",
    "He must have been extremely\ndifficult to live with for the last year or two.",
    "Poor Gerda he thought\nwith her unselfishness and her continual anxiety to please him.",
    "He\nwould be kinder in future.",
    "And perhaps now he would be able to stop trying to bully Henrietta.",
    "Not that one could really bully Henrietta  she wasnt made that way.",
    "Storms broke over her and she stood there meditative her eyes\nlooking at you from very far away...",
    "He thought I shall go to Henrietta and tell her.",
    "He looked up sharply disturbed by some small unexpected sound.",
    "There had been shots in the woods higher up and there had been the\nusual small noises of woodlands birds and the faint melancholy\ndropping of leaves.",
    "But this was another noise  a very faint\nbusinesslike click...\n\nAnd suddenly John was acutely conscious of danger.",
    "How long had\nhe been sitting here Half an hour An hour There was someone\nwatching him.",
    "Someone \n\n\fAnd that click was  of course it was \n\nHe turned sharply a man very quick in his reactions.",
    "But he was not\nquick enough.",
    "His eyes widened in surprise but there was no time for\nhim to make a sound.",
    "The shot rang out and he fell awkwardly sprawled out by the edge of\nthe swimming pool...\n\nA dark stain welled up slowly on his left side and trickled slowly onto\nthe concrete of the pool edge and from there dripped red into the blue\nwater...\n\nChapter 11\n\nHercule Poirot flicked a last speck of dust from his shoes.",
    "He had\ndressed carefully for his luncheon party and he was satisfied with the\nresult.",
    "He knew well enough the kind of clothes that were worn in the country\non a Sunday in England but he did not choose to conform to English\nideas.",
    "He preferred his own standards of urban smartness.",
    "He was not\nan English country gentleman and he would not dress like an English\ncountry gentleman.",
    "He was Hercule Poirot\n\nHe did not he confessed it to himself really like the country.",
    "The\nweekend cottage  so many of his friends had extolled it  he had\nallowed himself to succumb and had purchased Resthaven though\n\n\fthe only thing he had liked about it was its shape which was quite\nsquare like a box.",
    "The surrounding landscape he did not care for\nthough it was he knew supposed to be a beauty spot.",
    "It was\nhowever too wildly asymmetrical to appeal to him.",
    "He did not care\nmuch for trees at any time  they had that untidy habit of shedding their\nleaves He could endure poplars and he approved of a monkey puzzle but this riot of beech and oak left him unmoved.",
    "Such a landscape was\nbest enjoyed from a car on a fine afternoon.",
    "You exclaimed Quel\nbeau paysage and drove back to a good hotel.",
    "The best thing about Resthaven he considered was the small\nvegetable garden neatly laid out in rows by his Belgian gardener\nVictor.",
    "Meanwhile Fran\u00e7oise Victors wife devoted herself with\ntenderness to the care of her employers stomach.",
    "Hercule Poirot passed through the gate sighed glanced down once\nmore at his shining black shoes adjusted his pale grey Homburg hat\nand looked up and down the road.",
    "He shivered slightly at the aspect of Dovecotes.",
    "Dovecotes and\nResthaven had been erected by rival builders each of whom had\nacquired a small piece of land.",
    "Further enterprise on their part had\nbeen swiftly curtailed by a National Trust for preserving the beauties\nof the countryside.",
    "The two houses remained representative of two\nschools of thought.",
    "Resthaven was a box with a roof severely modern\nand a little dull.",
    "Dovecotes was a riot of halftimbering and Olde\nWorlde packed into as small a space as possible.",
    "Hercule Poirot debated within himself as to how he should approach\nThe Hollow.",
    "There was he knew a little higher up the lane a small\n\n\fgate and a path.",
    "This the unofficial way would save a half mile detour\nby the road.",
    "Nevertheless Hercule Poirot a stickler for etiquette\ndecided to take the longer way round and approach the house\ncorrectly by the front entrance.",
    "This was his first visit to Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell.",
    "One should not\nhe considered take short cuts uninvited especially when one was the\nguest of people of social importance.",
    "He was it must be admitted\npleased by their invitation.",
    "Je suis un peu snob he murmured to himself.",
    "He had retained an agreeable impression of the Angkatells from the\ntime in Baghdad particularly of Lady Angkatell.",
    "Une originale he thought to himself.",
    "His estimation of the time required for walking to The Hollow by road\nwas accurate.",
    "It was exactly one minute to one when he rang the front\ndoor bell.",
    "He was glad to have arrived and felt slightly tired.",
    "He was\nnot fond of walking.",
    "The door was opened by the magnificent Gudgeon of whom Poirot\napproved.",
    "His reception however was not quite as he had hoped.",
    "Her ladyship is in the pavilion by the swimming pool sir.",
    "Will you come\nthis way\n\nThe passion of the English for sitting out of doors irritated Hercule\nPoirot.",
    "Though one had to put up with this whimsy in the height of\n\n\fSummer surely Poirot thought one should be safe from it by the end\nof September The day was mild certainly but it had as Autumn days\nalways had a certain dampness.",
    "How infinitely pleasanter to have\nbeen ushered into a comfortable drawingroom with perhaps a small\nfire in the grate.",
    "But no here he was being led out through French\nwindows across a slope of lawn past a rockery and then through a\nsmall gate and along a narrow track between closely planted young\nchestnuts.",
    "It was the habit of the Angkatells to invite guests for one oclock and\non fine days they had cocktails and sherry in the small pavilion by the\nswimming pool.",
    "Lunch itself was scheduled for onethirty by which\ntime the most unpunctual of guests should have managed to arrive\nwhich permitted Lady Angkatells excellent cook to embark on souffles\nand such accurately timed delicacies without too much trepidation.",
    "To Hercule Poirot the plan did not commend itself.",
    "In a little minute he thought I shall be almost back where I\nstarted.",
    "With an increasing awareness of his feet in his shoes he followed\nGudgeons tall figure.",
    "It was at that moment from just ahead of him that he heard a little cry.",
    "It increased somehow his dissatisfaction.",
    "It was incongruous in\nsome way unfitting.",
    "He did not classify it nor indeed think about it.",
    "When he thought about it afterwards he was hard put to it to remember\njust what emotions it had seemed to convey.",
    "Dismay Surprise\n\n\fHorror He could only say that it suggested very definitely the\nunexpected.",
    "Gudgeon stepped out from the chestnuts.",
    "He was moving to one side\ndeferentially to allow Poirot to pass and at the same time clearing his\nthroat preparatory to murmuring M. Poirot mlady in the proper\nsubdued and respectful tones when his suppleness became suddenly\nrigid.",
    "He gasped.",
    "It was an unbutlerlike noise.",
    "Hercule Poirot stepped out onto the open space surrounding the\nswimming pool and immediately he too stiffened but with annoyance.",
    "It was too much  it was really too much He had not suspected such\ncheapness of the Angkatells.",
    "The long walk by the road the\ndisappointment at the house  and now this The misplaced sense of\nhumour of the English\n\nHe was annoyed and he was bored  oh how he was bored Death was\nnot to him amusing.",
    "And here they had arranged for him by way of a\njoke a set piece.",
    "For what he was looking at was a highly artificial murder scene.",
    "By the\nside of the pool was the body artistically arranged with an outflung\narm and even some red paint dripping gently over the edge of the\nconcrete into the pool.",
    "It was a spectacular body that of a handsome\nfairhaired man.",
    "Standing over the body revolver in hand was a\nwoman a short powerfully built middleaged woman with a curiously\nblank expression.",
    "And there were three other actors.",
    "On the far side of the pool was a\ntall young woman whose hair matched the Autumn leaves in its rich\nbrown she had a basket in her hand full of dahlia heads.",
    "A little further\noff was a man a tall inconspicuous man in a shooting coat carrying a\ngun.",
    "And immediately on his left with a basket of eggs in her hand\nwas his hostess Lady Angkatell.",
    "It was clear to Hercule Poirot that several different paths converged\nhere at the swimming pool and that these people had each arrived by a\ndifferent path.",
    "It was all very mathematical and artificial.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Enfin what did they expect him to do Was he to pretend to\nbelieve in this crime Was he to register dismay  alarm Or was he\nto bow to congratulate his I hostess  Ah but it is very charming\nwhat you arrange for me here.",
    "Really the whole thing was very stupid  not spirituel at all Was it not\nQueen Victoria who had said We are not amused He felt very\ninclined to say the same.",
    "I Hercule Poirot am not amused.",
    "Lady Angkatell had walked towards the body.",
    "He followed conscious\nof Gudgeon still breathing hard behind him.",
    "He is not in the secret\nthat one Hercule Poirot thought to himself.",
    "From the other side of the\npool the other two people joined them.",
    "They were all quite close now\nlooking down on that spectacular sprawling figure by the pools edge.",
    "And suddenly with a terrific shock with that feeling as of blurring on a\ncinematograph screen before the picture comes into focus Hercule\nPoirot realized that this artificially set scene had a point of reality.",
    "For what he was looking down at was if not a dead at least a dying\nman...",
    "It was not red paint dripping off the edge of the concrete it was blood.",
    "This man had been shot and shot a very short time ago.",
    "He darted a quick glance at the woman who stood there revolver in\nhand.",
    "Her face was quite blank without feeling of any kind.",
    "She looked\ndazed and rather stupid.",
    "Curious he thought.",
    "Had she he wondered drained herself of all emotion all feeling in the\nfiring of the shot Was she now all passion spent nothing but an\nexhausted shell It might be so he thought.",
    "Then he looked down on the shot man and he started.",
    "For the dying\nmans eyes were open.",
    "They were intensely blue eyes and they held an\nexpression that Poirot could not read but which he described to\nhimself as a kind of intense awareness.",
    "And suddenly or so it felt to Poirot there seemed to be in all this group\nof people only one person who was really alive  the man who was at\nthe point of death...\n\n\fPoirot had never received so strong an impression of vivid and intense\nvitality.",
    "The others were pale shadowy figures actors in a remote\ndrama but this man was real...\n\nJohn Christow opened his mouth and spoke.",
    "His voice was strong\nunsurprised and urgent.",
    "Henrietta  he said.",
    "Then his eyelids dropped his head jerked sideways...\n\nHercule Poirot knelt down made sure then rose to his feet\nmechanically dusting the knees of his trousers.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "He is dead...",
    "The picture broke up wavered refocussed itself.",
    "There were\nindividual reactions now  trivial happenings.",
    "Poirot was conscious of\nhimself as a kind of magnified eyes and ears  recording.",
    "Just that\nrecording.",
    "He was aware of Lady Angkatells hand relaxing its grip on her basket\nand Gudgeon springing forward quickly taking it from her.",
    "Allow me mlady...",
    "Mechanically quite naturally Lady Angkatell murmured\n\nThank you Gudgeon.",
    "And then hesitantly she said\n\nGerda \n\nThe woman holding the revolver stirred for the first time.",
    "She looked\nround at them all.",
    "When she spoke her voice held what seemed to be\npure bewilderment.",
    "Johns dead she said.",
    "Johns dead...\n\nWith a kind of swift authority the tall young woman with the leaf brown\nhair came swiftly to her.",
    "Give that to me Gerda she said.",
    "And dexterously before Poirot could protest or intervene she had\ntaken the revolver out of Gerda Christows hand.",
    "Poirot took a quick step forwards.",
    "You should not do that Mademoiselle \n\nThe young woman started nervously at the sound of his voice.",
    "The\nrevolver slipped through her fingers.",
    "She was standing by the edge of\nthe pool and the revolver fell with a splash into the water.",
    "Her mouth opened and she uttered an oh of consternation turning\nher head to look at Poirot apologetically.",
    "What a fool I am she said.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "Poirot did not speak for a moment.",
    "He was staring into a pair of clear\nhazel eyes.",
    "They met his quite steadily and he wondered if his\nmomentary suspicion had been unjust.",
    "He said quietly\n\nThings should be handled as little as possible.",
    "Everything must be left\nexactly as it is for the police to see.",
    "There was a little stir then  very faint just a ripple of uneasiness.",
    "Lady Angkatell murmured distastefully Of course.",
    "I suposse  yes the\npolice \n\nIn a quiet pleasant voice tinged with fastidious repulsion the man in\nthe shooting coat said Im afraid Lucy its inevitable.",
    "Into that moment of silence and realization there came the sound of\nfootsteps\n\nand\n\nvoices\n\nassured\n\nbrisk\n\nfootsteps\n\nand\n\ncheerful\n\nincongruous voices.",
    "Along the path from the house came Sir Henry Angkatell and Midge\nHardcastle talking and laughing together.",
    "At the sight of the group round the pool Sir Henry stopped short and\nexclaimed in astonishment\n\nWhats the matter Whats happened\n\n\fHis wife answered.",
    "Gerda has  she broke off sharply.",
    "I mean  John is \n\nGerda said in her flat bewildered voice\n\nJohn has been shot... hes dead...",
    "They all looked away from her embarrassed.",
    "Then Lady Angkatell said quickly\n\nMy dear I think youd better go and  and lie down... Perhaps we had\nbetter all go back to the house Henry you and M. Poirot can stay here\nand  and wait for the police.",
    "That will be the best plan I think said Sir Henry.",
    "He turned to\nGudgeon.",
    "Will you ring up the police station Gudgeon Just state\nexactly what has occurred.",
    "When the police arrive bring them straight\nout here.",
    "Gudgeon bent his head a little and said Yes Sir Henry.",
    "He was\nlooking a little white about the gills but he was still the perfect servant.",
    "The tall young woman said Come Gerda and putting her hand\nthrough the other womans arm she led her unresistingly away and\nalong the path towards the house.",
    "Gerda walked as though in a dream.",
    "Gudgeon stood back a little to let them pass and then followed\ncarrying the basket of eggs.",
    "Sir Henry turned sharply to his wife.",
    "Now Lucy what is all this What happened exactly\n\nLady Angkatell stretched out vague hands a lovely helpless gesture.",
    "Hercule Poirot felt the charm of it and the appeal.",
    "My dear I hardly know...",
    "I was down by the hens.",
    "I heard a shot that\nseemed very near but I didnt really think anything about it.",
    "After all\nshe appealed to them all one doesnt And then I came up the path to\nthe pool and there was John lying there and Gerda standing over him\nwith the revolver.",
    "Henrietta and Edward arrived almost at the same\nmoment  from over there.",
    "She nodded towards the farther side of the pool where two paths ran\nup into the woods.",
    "Hercule Poirot cleared his throat.",
    "Who were they this John and this Gerda If I may know he added\napologetically.",
    "Oh of course.",
    "Lady Angkatell turned to him in quick apology.",
    "One\nforgets  but then one doesnt exactly introduce people  not when\nsomebody has just been killed.",
    "John is John Christow Dr. Christow.",
    "Gerda Christow is his wife.",
    "And the lady who went with Mrs. Christow to the house\n\nMy cousin Henrietta Savernake.",
    "There was a movement a very faint movement from the man on\nPoirots left.",
    "Henrietta Savernake thought Poirot and he does not like that she\nshould say it  but it is after all inevitable that I should know...\n\nHenrietta the dying man had said.",
    "He had said it in a very curious\nway.",
    "A way that reminded Poirot of something  of some incident...\nnow what was it No matter it would come to him.",
    "Lady Angkatell was going on determined now on fulfilling her social\nduties.",
    "And this is another cousin of ours Edward Angkatell.",
    "And Miss\nHardcastle.",
    "Poirot acknowledged the introductions with polite bows.",
    "Midge felt\nsuddenly that she wanted to laugh hysterically she controlled herself\nwith an effort.",
    "And now my dear said Sir Henry I think that as you suggested\nyou had better go back to the house...",
    "I will have a word or two here\nwith M. Poirot.",
    "Lady Angkatell looked thoughtfully at them.",
    "I do hope she said that Gerda is lying down.",
    "Was that the right\nthing to suggest I really couldnt think what to say.",
    "I mean one has no\n\n\fprecedent.",
    "What does one say to a woman who has just killed her\nhusband\n\nShe looked at them as though hoping that some authoritative answer\nmight be given to her question.",
    "Then she went along the path towards the house.",
    "Midge followed her.",
    "Edward brought up the rear.",
    "Poirot was left with his host.",
    "Sir Henry cleared his throat.",
    "He seemed a little uncertain what to say.",
    "Christow he observed at last was a very able fellow  a very able\nfellow.",
    "Poirots eyes rested once more on the dead man.",
    "He still had the\ncurious impression that the dead man was more alive than the living.",
    "He wondered what gave him that impression.",
    "He responded politely to Sir Henry\n\nSuch a tragedy as this is very unfortunate he said.",
    "This sort of thing is more in your line than mine said Sir Henry.",
    "I\ndont think I have ever been at close quarters with a murder before.",
    "I\nhope Ive done the right thing so far\n\n\fThe procedure has been quite correct said Poirot.",
    "You have\nsummoned the police and until they arrive and take charge there is\nnothing for us to do  except to make sure that nobody disturbs the\nbody or tampers with the evidence.",
    "As he said the last word he looked down into the pool where he could\nsee the revolver lying on the concrete bottom slightly distorted by the\nblue water.",
    "The evidence he thought had perhaps already been tampered with\nbefore he Hercule Poirot had been able to prevent it...",
    "But no  that had been an accident.",
    "Sir Henry murmured distastefully\n\nThink weve got to stand about A bit chilly.",
    "It would be all right I\nshould think if we went inside the pavilion\n\nPoirot who had been conscious of damp feet and a disposition to\nshiver acquiesced gladly.",
    "The pavilion was at the side of the pool\nfarthest from the house and through its open door they commanded a\nview of the pool and the body and the path to the house along which\nthe police would come.",
    "The pavilion was luxuriously furnished with comfortable settees and\ngay native rugs.",
    "On a painted iron table a tray was set with glasses\nand a decanter of sherry.",
    "Id offer you a drink said Sir Henry but I suppose Id better not\ntouch anything until the police come  not I should imagine that\ntheres anything to interest them in here.",
    "Still it is better to be on the\nsafe side.",
    "Gudgeon hadnt brought out the cocktails yet I see.",
    "He was\nwaiting for you to arrive.",
    "The two men sat down rather gingerly in two wicker chairs near the\ndoor so that they could watch the path from the house.",
    "A constraint settled over them.",
    "It was an occasion on which it was\ndifficult to make small talk.",
    "Poirot glanced round the pavilion noting anything that struck him as\nunusual.",
    "An expensive cape of platinum fox had been flung carelessly\nacross the back of one of the chairs.",
    "He wondered whose it was.",
    "Its\nrather ostentatious magnificence did not harmonize with any of the\npeople he had seen up to now.",
    "He could not for instance imagine it\nround Lady Angkatells shoulders.",
    "It worried him.",
    "It breathed a mixture of opulence and selfadvertisement  and those characteristics were lacking in anyone he\nhad seen so far.",
    "I suppose we can smoke said Sir Henry offering his case to Poirot.",
    "Before taking the cigarette Poirot sniffed the air.",
    "French perfume... an expensive French perfume... Only a trace of it\nlingered but it was there and again the scent was not the scent that\nassociated itself in his mind with any of the occupants of The Hollow...\n\n\fAs he leaned forward to light his cigarette at Sir Henrys lighter\nPoirots glance fell on a little pile of matchboxes  six of them  stacked\non a small table near one of the settees.",
    "It was a detail that struck him as definitely odd.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nHalf past two said Lady Angkatell.",
    "She was in the drawingroom with Midge and Edward.",
    "From behind the\nclosed door of Sir Henrys study came the murmur of voices.",
    "Hercule\nPoirot Sir Henry and Inspector Grange were in there.",
    "Lady Angkatell sighed.",
    "You know Midge I still feel one ought to do something about lunch...",
    "It seems of course quite heartless to sit down round the table as\nthough nothing had happened.",
    "But after all M. Poirot was asked to\nlunch  and he is probably hungry.",
    "And it cant be upsetting to him that\npoor John Christow has been killed like it is to us... And I must say that\nthough I really do not feel like eating myself Henry and Edward must\nbe extremely hungry after being out shooting all the morning \n\nEdward Angkatell said Dont worry on my account Lucy dear.",
    "You are always considerate Edward.",
    "And then there is David  I\nnoticed that he ate a great deal at dinner last night.",
    "Intellectual people\nalways seem to need a good deal of food.",
    "Where is David by the way\n\nHe went up to his room said Midge after he had heard what had\nhappened.",
    "Yes  well that was rather tactful of him.",
    "I daresay it made him feel\nawkward... Of course say what you like a murder is an awkward thing\n it upsets the servants and puts the general routine out  we were\nhaving ducks for lunch  fortunately they are quite nice eaten cold...\nWhat does one do about Gerda do you think Something on a tray A\nlittle strong soup perhaps\n\nReally thought Midge Lucy is inhuman And then with a qualm she\nreflected that it was perhaps because Lucy was too human that it\nshocked one so Wasnt it the plain unvarnished truth that all\ncatastrophes were hedged round with these little trivial wonderings\nand surmises Lucy merely gave utterance to the thoughts which most\npeople did not acknowledge.",
    "One did remember the servants and\nworry about meals and one did even feel hungry.",
    "She felt hungry\nherself at this very moment Hungry she thought and at the same\ntime rather sick... A curious mixture.",
    "And there was undoubtedly just plain awkward embarrassment in not\nknowing how to react to a quiet commonplace woman whom one had\nreferred to only yesterday as poor Gerda and who was now\npresumably shortly to be standing in the dock accused of murder.",
    "These things happen to other people thought Midge.",
    "They cant\nhappen to us.",
    "She looked across the room at Edward.",
    "They oughtnt she thought to\nhappen to people like Edward.",
    "People who are so very unviolent... She\ntook comfort in looking at Edward.",
    "Edward so quiet so reasonable so\nkind and calm...\n\nGudgeon entered inclined himself confidentially and spoke in a\nsuitably muted voice.",
    "I have placed sandwiches and some coffee in the dining room\nmlady.",
    "Oh thank you Gudgeon\n\nReally said Lady Angkatell as Gudgeon left the room.",
    "Gudgeon is\nwonderful I dont know what I should do without Gudgeon.",
    "He always\nknows the right thing to do.",
    "Some really substantial sandwiches are as\ngood as lunch  and nothing heartless about them if you know what I\nmean\n\nOh Lucy dont...\n\nMidge suddenly felt warm tears running down her cheeks.",
    "Lady\nAngkatell looked surprised murmured\n\nPoor darling.",
    "Its all been too much for you.",
    "Edward crossed to the sofa and sat down by Midge.",
    "He put his arm\nround her.",
    "Dont worry little Midge he said.",
    "Midge buried her face on his shoulder and sobbed there comfortably.",
    "She remembered how nice Edward had been to her when her rabbit\nhad died at Ainswick one Easter holiday.",
    "Edward said gently Its been a shock.",
    "Can I get her some brandy\nLucy\n\nOn the sideboard in the dining room.",
    "I dont think \n\nShe broke off as Henrietta came into the room.",
    "Midge sat up.",
    "She felt\nEdward stiffen and sit very still.",
    "What thought Midge does Henrietta feel She felt almost reluctant to\nlook at her cousin  but there was nothing to see.",
    "Henrietta looked if\nanything belligerent.",
    "She had come in with her chin up her colour\nhigh and with a certain swiftness.",
    "Oh there you are Henrietta cried Lady Angkatell.",
    "I have been\nwondering.",
    "The police are with Henry and M. Poirot.",
    "What have you\ngiven Gerda Brandy Or tea and an aspirin\n\nI gave her some brandy  and a hot water bottle.",
    "Quite right said Lady Angkatell approvingly.",
    "Thats what they tell\nyou in First Aid classes  the hot water bottle I mean for shock  not\n\n\fthe brandy there is a reaction nowadays against stimulants.",
    "But I\nthink that is only a fashion.",
    "We always gave brandy for shock when I\nwas a girl at Ainswick.",
    "Though really I suppose it cant be exactly\nshock with Gerda I dont know really what one would feel if one had\nkilled ones husband  its the sort of thing one just cant begin to\nimagine  but it wouldnt exactly give one a shock.",
    "I mean there\nwouldnt be any element of surprise.",
    "Henriettas voice icy cold cut into the placid atmosphere.",
    "She said Why are you all so sure that Gerda killed John\n\nThere was a moments pause  and Midge felt a curious shifting in the\natmosphere  there was confusion strain and finally a kind of slow\nwatchfulness.",
    "Then Lady Angkatell said her voice quite devoid of any inflection\n\nIt seemed  selfevident.",
    "What else do you suggest\n\nIsnt it possible that Gerda came along to the pool that she found\nJohn  lying there and that she had just picked up the revolver when when we came upon the scene\n\nAgain there was that silence.",
    "Then Lady Angkatell asked\n\nIs that what Gerda says\n\nYes.",
    "It was not a simple assent.",
    "It had force behind it.",
    "It came out like a\nrevolver shot.",
    "Lady Angkatell raised her eyebrows then she said with apparent\nirrelevancy\n\nThere are sandwiches and coffee in the dining room.",
    "She broke off with a little gasp as Gerda Christow came through the\nopen door.",
    "Gerda said hurriedly and apologetically\n\nI  I really didnt feel I could lie down any longer.",
    "One is  one is so\nterribly restless.",
    "Lady Angkatell cried\n\nYou must sit down  you must sit down at once.",
    "She displaced Midge from the sofa settled Gerda there put a cushion\nat her back.",
    "You poor dear said Lady Angkatell.",
    "She spoke with emphasis but the words seemed quite meaningless.",
    "Edward walked to the window and stood there looking out.",
    "Gerda pushed back the untidy hair from her forehead.",
    "She spoke in a\nworried bewildered tone\n\n\fI  I really am only just beginning to realize it.",
    "You know I havent been\nable to feel  I still cant feel  that its real  that John  is dead.",
    "She\nbegan to shake a little.",
    "Who can have killed him Who can possibly\nhave killed him\n\nLady Angkatell drew a deep breath  then she turned her head sharply.",
    "Sir Henrys door had opened.",
    "He came in accompanied by Inspector\nGrange who was a large heavily built man with a downdrooping\npessimistic moustache.",
    "This is my wife  Inspector Grange.",
    "Grange bowed and said\n\nI was wondering Lady Angkatell if I could have a few words with Mrs.\nChristow \n\nHe broke off as Lady Angkatell indicated the figure on the sofa.",
    "Mrs. Christow\n\nGerda said eagerly\n\nYes I am Mrs. Christow.",
    "I dont want to distress you Mrs. Christow but I would like to ask you\na few questions.",
    "You can of course have your solicitor present if you\nprefer it \n\nSir Henry put in\n\n\fIt is sometimes wiser Gerda \n\nShe interrupted\n\nA solicitor Why a solicitor Why should a solicitor know anything\nabout Johns death\n\nInspector Grange coughed.",
    "Sir Henry seemed about to speak.",
    "Henrietta put in\n\nThe Inspector only wants to know just what happened this morning.",
    "Gerda turned to him.",
    "She spoke in a wondering voice\n\nIt seems all like a bad dream  not real.",
    "I  I havent been able to cry or\nanything.",
    "One just doesnt feel anything at all.",
    "Grange said soothingly\n\nThats the shock Mrs. Christow.",
    "Yes yes  I suppose it is...",
    "But you see it was all so sudden.",
    "I went out\nfrom the house and along the path to the swimming pool \n\nAt what time Mrs. Christow\n\nIt was just before one oclock  about two minutes to one.",
    "I know\nbecause I looked at that clock.",
    "And when I got there  there was John\nlying there  and blood on the edge of the concrete...\n\n\fDid you hear a shot Mrs. Christow\n\nYes  no  I dont know.",
    "I knew Sir Henry and Mr. Angkatell were out\nshooting...",
    "I  I just saw John \n\nYes Mrs. Christow\n\nJohn  and blood  and a revolver.",
    "I picked up the revolver \n\nWhy\n\nI beg your pardon\n\nWhy did you pick up the revolver Mrs. Christow\n\nI  I dont know.",
    "You shouldnt have touched it you know.",
    "Shouldnt I Gerda was vague her face vacant.",
    "But I did.",
    "I held it in\nmy hand...\n\nShe looked down now at her hands as though she was in fancy seeing\nthe revolver lying in them.",
    "She turned sharply to the Inspector.",
    "Her voice was suddenly sharp anguished.",
    "Who could have killed John Nobody could have wanted to kill him.",
    "He was  he was the best of men.",
    "So kind so unselfish  he did\neverything for other people.",
    "Everybody loved him Inspector.",
    "He was a\nwonderful doctor.",
    "The best and kindest of husbands.",
    "It must have been\nan accident  it must  it must\n\nShe flung out a hand to the room.",
    "Ask anyone Inspector.",
    "Nobody could have wanted to kill John could\nthey\n\nShe appealed to them all.",
    "Inspector Grange closed up his notebook.",
    "Thank you Mrs. Christow he said in an unemotional voice.",
    "That will\nbe all for the present.",
    "Hercule Poirot and Inspector Grange went together through the\nchestnut woods to the swimming pool.",
    "The thing that had been John\nChristow but which was now the body had been photographed and\nmeasured and written about and examined by the police surgeon and\nhad now been taken away to the mortuary.",
    "The swimming pool Poirot\nthought looked curiously innocent.",
    "Everything about today he\nthought had been strangely fluid.",
    "Except John Christow  he had not\nbeen fluid.",
    "Even in death he had been purposeful and objective.",
    "The\nswimming pool was not now preeminently a swimming pool it was the\nplace where John Christows body had lain and where his life blood\nhad welled away over concrete into artificially blue water...",
    "Artificial  for a moment Poirot grasped at the word...",
    "Yes there had\nbeen something artificial about it all.",
    "As though \n\nA man in a bathing suit came up to the Inspector.",
    "Heres the revolver sir he said.",
    "Grange took the dripping object gingerly.",
    "No hope of fingerprints now he remarked but luckily it doesnt\nmatter in this case.",
    "Mrs. Christow was actually holding the revolver\nwhen you arrived wasnt she M. Poirot\n\nYes.",
    "Identification of the revolver is the next thing said Grange.",
    "I should\nimagine Sir Henry will be able to do that for us.",
    "She got it from his\nstudy I should say.",
    "He cast a glance around the pool.",
    "Now lets have that again to be quite clear.",
    "The path below the pool\ncomes up from the farm and thats the way Lady Angkatell came.",
    "The\nother two Mr. Edward Angkatell and Miss Savernake came down from\nthe woods  but not together.",
    "He came by the lefthand path and she\nby the righthand one which leads out of the long flower walk above\nthe house.",
    "But they were both standing on the far side of the pool\nwhen you arrived\n\n\fYes.",
    "And this path here beside the pavilion leads on to Podders Lane.",
    "Right  well go along it.",
    "As they walked Grange spoke without excitement just with\nknowledge and quiet pessimism.",
    "Never like these cases much he said.",
    "Had one last year  down\nnear Ashridge.",
    "Retired military man he was  distinguished career.",
    "Wife was the nice quiet oldfashioned kind sixtyfive grey hair rather pretty hair with a wave in it.",
    "Did a lot of gardening.",
    "One day she\ngoes up to his room gets out his service revolver and walks out into\nthe garden and shoots him.",
    "Just like that A good deal behind it of\ncourse that one had to dig out.",
    "Sometimes they think up some fool\nstory about a tramp We pretend to accept it of course keep things\nquiet whilst were making inquiries but we know whats what.",
    "You mean said Poirot that you have decided that Mrs. Christow\nshot her husband\n\nGrange gave him a look of surprise.",
    "Well dont you think so\n\nPoirot said slowly It could all have happened as she said.",
    "Inspector Grange shrugged his shoulders.",
    "It could have  yes.",
    "But its a thin story.",
    "And they all think she killed\nhim They know something we dont.",
    "He looked curiously at his\ncompanion.",
    "You thought shed done it all right didnt you when you\narrived on the scene\n\nPoirot half closed his eyes.",
    "Coming along the path... Gudgeon stepping\naside... Gerda Christow standing over her husband with the revolver in\nher hand and that blank look on her face.",
    "Yes as Grange had said he\nhad thought she had done it... had thought at least that that was the\nimpression he was meant to have...",
    "Yes but that was not the same thing...\n\nA scene staged  set to deceive...\n\nHad Gerda Christow looked like a woman who had just shot her\nhusband That was what Inspector Grange wanted to know.",
    "And with a sudden shock of surprise Hercule Poirot realized that in all\nhis long experience of deeds of violence he had never actually come\nface to face with a woman who had just killed her husband... What\nwould a woman look like in such circumstances Triumphant horrified\nsatisfied dazed incredulous empty \n\nAny one of these things he thought...",
    "Inspector Grange was talking.",
    "Poirot caught the end of his speech.",
    "once you get all the facts behind the case and you can usually get\nall that from the servants.",
    "Mrs. Christow is going back to London\n\nYes.",
    "Therere a couple of kids there.",
    "Have to let her go.",
    "Of course we\nkeep a sharp eye on her but she wont know that.",
    "She thinks shes got\naway with it all right.",
    "Looks rather a stupid kind of woman to me...\n\nDid Gerda Christow realize Poirot wondered what the police thought and what the Angkatells thought She had looked as though she did\nnot realize anything at all  she had looked like a woman whose\nreactions were slow and who was completely dazed and heartbroken\nby her husbands death...",
    "They had come out into the lane.",
    "Poirot stopped by his gate.",
    "Grange said\n\nThis your little place Nice and snug.",
    "Well goodbye for the present\nM. Poirot.",
    "Thanks for your cooperation.",
    "Ill drop in sometime and give\nyou the lowdown on how were getting on.",
    "His eye travelled up the lane.",
    "Whos your neighbour Thats not where our new celebrity hangs out\nis it\n\nMiss Veronica Cray the actress comes there for weekends I\nbelieve.",
    "Of course.",
    "Dovecotes.",
    "I liked her in Lady Rides on Tiger but shes a bit\nhighbrow for my taste.",
    "Give me Deanna Durbin or Hedy Lamarr.",
    "He turned away.",
    "Well I must get back to the job.",
    "So long M. Poirot.",
    "You recognize this Sir Henry\n\nInspector Grange laid the revolver on the desk in front of Sir Henry and\nlooked at him expectantly.",
    "I can handle it Sir Henrys hand hesitated over the revolver as he\nasked the question.",
    "Grange nodded.",
    "Its been in the pool.",
    "Destroyed whatever fingerprints there were on\nit.",
    "A pity if I may say so that Miss Savernake let it slip out of her hand.",
    "Yes yes  but of course it was a very tense moment for all of us.",
    "Women are apt to get flustered and  er  drop things.",
    "Again Inspector Grange nodded.",
    "He said\n\nMiss Savernake seems a cool capable young lady on the whole.",
    "The words were devoid of emphasis yet something in them made Sir\nHenry look up sharply.",
    "Grange went on\n\n\fNow do you recognize it sir\n\nSir Henry picked up the revolver and examined it.",
    "He noted the number\nand compared it with a list in a small leatherbound book.",
    "Then closing\nthe book with a sigh he said\n\nYes Inspector this comes from my collection here.",
    "When did you see it last\n\nYesterday afternoon.",
    "We were doing some shooting in the garden\nwith a target and this was one of the firearms we were using.",
    "Who actually fired this revolver on that occasion\n\nI think everybody had at least one shot with it.",
    "Including Mrs. Christow\n\nIncluding Mrs. Christow.",
    "And after you had finished shooting\n\nI put the revolver away in its usual place.",
    "Here.",
    "He pulled out the drawer of a big bureau.",
    "It was half full of guns.",
    "Youve got a big collection of firearms Sir Henry.",
    "Its been a hobby of mine for many years.",
    "Inspector Granges eyes rested thoughtfully on the exGovernor of the\nHollowene Islands.",
    "A goodlooking distinguished man the kind of man\nhe would be quite pleased to serve under himself  in fact a man he\nwould much prefer to his own present Chief Constable.",
    "Inspector\nGrange did not think much of the Chief Constable of Wealdshire  a\nfussy despot and a tufthunter  he brought his mind back to the job in\nhand.",
    "The revolver was not of course loaded when you put it away Sir\nHenry\n\nCertainly not.",
    "And you keep your ammunition  where\n\nHere.",
    "Sir Henry took a key from a pigeonhole and unlocked one of\nthe lower drawers of the desk.",
    "Simple enough thought Grange.",
    "The Christow woman had seen where\nit was kept.",
    "Shed only got to come along and help herself.",
    "Jealousy\nhe thought plays the dickens with women.",
    "Hed lay ten to one it was\njealousy.",
    "The thing would come clear enough when hed finished the\nroutine here and got onto the Harley Street end.",
    "But youd got to do\nthings in their proper order.",
    "He got up and said\n\nWell thank you Sir Henry.",
    "Ill let you know about the inquest.",
    "Chapter 13\n\nThey had the cold ducks for supper.",
    "After the ducks there was a\ncaramel custard which Lady Angkatell said showed just the right\nfeeling on the part of Mrs. Medway.",
    "Cooking she said really gave great scope to delicacy of feeling.",
    "We are only as she knows moderately fond of caramel custard.",
    "There would be something very gross just after the death of a friend\nin eating ones favourite pudding.",
    "But caramel custard is so easy slippery if you know what I mean  and then one leaves a little on ones\nplate.",
    "She sighed and said that she hoped they had done right in letting\nGerda go back to London.",
    "But quite correct of Henry to go with her.",
    "For Sir Henry had insisted on driving Gerda to Harley Street.",
    "She will come back here for the inquest of course went on Lady\nAngkatell meditatively eating caramel custard.",
    "But naturally she\nwanted to break it to the children  they might see it in the papers and\nwith only a Frenchwoman in the house  one knows how excitable  a\ncrise de nerfs possibly.",
    "But Henry will deal with her and I really think\nGerda will be quite all right.",
    "She will probably send for some relations \n\n\fsisters perhaps.",
    "Gerda is the sort of person who is sure to have sisters\n three or four I should think probably living at Tunbridge Wells.",
    "What extraordinary things you do say Lucy said Midge.",
    "Well darling Torquay if you prefer it  no not Torquay.",
    "They would be\nat least sixtyfive if they were living at Torquay  Eastboune perhaps\nor St. Leonards.",
    "Lady Angkatell looked at the last spoonful of caramel custard seemed\nto condole with it and laid it down very gently uneaten.",
    "David who liked only savouries looked down gloomily at his empty\nplate.",
    "Lady Angkatell got up.",
    "I think we shall all want to go to bed early tonight she said.",
    "So\nmuch has happened hasnt it One has no idea from reading about\nthese things in the paper how tiring they are.",
    "I feel you know as\nthough I had walked about fifteen miles... instead of actually having\ndone nothing but sit about  but that is tiring too because one does\nnot like to read a book or a newspaper it looks so heartless.",
    "Though I\nthink perhaps the leading article in the Observer would have been all\nright  but not the News of the World.",
    "Dont you agree with me David I\nlike to know what the young people think it keeps one from losing\ntouch.",
    "David said in a gruff voice that he never read the News of the World.",
    "I always do said Lady Angkatell.",
    "We pretend we get it for the\nservants but Gudgeon is very understanding and never takes it out\nuntil after tea.",
    "It is a most interesting paper all about women who put\ntheir heads in gas ovens  an incredible number of them\n\nWhat will they do in the houses of the future which are all electric\nasked Edward Angkatell with a faint smile.",
    "I suppose they will just have to decide to make the best of things  so\nmuch more sensible.",
    "I disagree with you sir said David about the houses of the future\nbeing all electric.",
    "There can be communal heating laid on from a\ncentral supply.",
    "Every workingclass house should be completely\nlaboursaving \n\nEdward Angkatell said hastily that he was afraid that was a subject he\nwas not very well up in.",
    "Davids lip curled with scorn.",
    "Gudgeon brought in coffee on a tray moving a little slower than usual\nto convey a sense of mourning.",
    "Oh Gudgeon said Lady Angkatell about those eggs I meant to\nwrite the date in pencil on them as usual.",
    "Will you ask Mrs. Medway to\nsee to it\n\nI think you will find mlady that everything has been attended to quite\nsatisfactorily.",
    "He cleared his throat.",
    "I have seen to things myself.",
    "Oh thank you Gudgeon.",
    "As Gudgeon went out she murmured Really Gudgeon is wonderful.",
    "The servants are all being marvellous.",
    "And one does so sympathize\nwith them having the police here  it must be dreadful for them.",
    "By the\nway are there any left\n\nPolice do you mean asked Midge.",
    "Yes.",
    "Dont they usually leave one standing in the hall Or perhaps hes\nwatching the front door from the shrubbery outside.",
    "Why should he watch the front door\n\nI dont know Im sure.",
    "They do in books.",
    "And then somebody else is\nmurdered in the night.",
    "Oh Lucy dont said Midge.",
    "Lady Angkatell looked at her curiously.",
    "Darling I am so sorry.",
    "Stupid of me.",
    "And of course nobody else\ncould be murdered.",
    "Gerdas gone home  I mean oh Henrietta dear I\nam sorry.",
    "I didnt mean to say that.",
    "But Henrietta did not answer.",
    "She was standing by the round table\nstaring down at the bridge score she had kept last night.",
    "She said rousing herself Sorry Lucy what did you say\n\nI wondered if there were any police left over\n\n\fLike remnants in a sale I dont think so.",
    "Theyve all gone back to the\npolice station to write out what we said in proper police language.",
    "What are you looking at Henrietta\n\nNothing.",
    "Henrietta moved across to the mantelpiece.",
    "What do you think Veronica Cray is doing tonight she asked.",
    "A look of dismay crossed Lady Angkatells face.",
    "My dear You dont think she might come over here again She must\nhave heard by now.",
    "Yes said Henrietta thoughtfully.",
    "I suppose shes heard...",
    "Which reminds me said Lady Angkatell I really must telephone to\nthe Careys.",
    "We cant have them coming to lunch tomorrow just as\nthough nothing had happened.",
    "She left the room.",
    "David hating his relations murmured that he wanted to look up\nsomething in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.",
    "The library he thought\nwould be a peaceful place.",
    "Henrietta went to the French windows opened them and passed\nthrough.",
    "After a moments hesitation Edward followed her.",
    "He found her standing outside looking up at the sky.",
    "She said\n\nNot so warm as last night is it\n\nIn his pleasant voice Edward said No distinctly chilly.",
    "She was standing looking up at the house.",
    "Her eyes were running\nalong the windows.",
    "Then she turned and looked towards the woods.",
    "He had no clue to what was in her mind.",
    "He made a movement towards the open window.",
    "Better come in.",
    "Its cold.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "Im going for a stroll.",
    "To the swimming pool.",
    "Oh my dear  He took a quick step towards her.",
    "Ill come with you.",
    "No thank you Edward.",
    "Her voice cut sharply through the chill of the\nair.",
    "I want to be alone with my dead.",
    "Henrietta My dear  I havent said anything.",
    "But you do know how how sorry I am.",
    "Sorry That John Christow is dead\n\n\fThere was still the brittle sharpness in her tone.",
    "I meant  sorry for you Henrietta.",
    "I know it must have been a  a great\nshock.",
    "Shock Oh but Im very tough Edward I can stand shocks.",
    "Was it a\nshock to you What did you feel when you saw him lying there Glad I\nsuppose... You didnt like John Christow.",
    "Edward murmured He and I  hadnt much in common.",
    "How nicely you put things In such a restrained way.",
    "But as a matter\nof fact you did have one thing in common.",
    "Me You were both fond of\nme werent you Only that didnt make a bond between you  quite the\nopposite.",
    "The moon came fitfully through a cloud and he was startled as he\nsuddenly saw her face looking at him.",
    "Unconsciously he always saw\nHenrietta as a projection of the Henrietta he had known at Ainswick.",
    "To him she was always a laughing girl with dancing eyes full of eager\nexpectation.",
    "The woman he saw now seemed to him a stranger with\neyes that were brilliant but cold and which seemed to look at him\ninimically.",
    "He said earnestly\n\nHenrietta dearest do believe this  that I do sympathize with you  in in your grief your loss.",
    "Is it grief\n\nThe question startled him.",
    "She seemed to be asking it not of him but of\nherself.",
    "She said in a low voice\n\nSo quick  it can happen so quickly... One moment living breathing\nand the next  dead  gone  emptiness.",
    "Oh the emptiness And here\nwe are all of us eating caramel custard and calling ourselves alive and John who was more alive than any of us is dead.",
    "I say the word\nyou know over and over again to myself.",
    "Deaddeaddeaddeaddead... And soon it hasnt got any meaning  not any meaning at all...\nIts just a funny little word like the breaking off of a rotten branch.",
    "Deaddeaddeaddead Its like a tomtom isnt it beating in the\njungle Deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead\n\nHenrietta stop For Gods sake stop\n\nShe looked at him curiously.",
    "Didnt you know Id feel like this What did you think That Id sit\ngently crying into a nice little pocket handkerchief while you held my\nhand.",
    "That it would all be a great shock but that presently Id begin to\nget over it.",
    "And that youd comfort me very nicely.",
    "You are nice\nEdward.",
    "Youre very nice but youre so  so inadequate.",
    "He drew back.",
    "His face stiffened.",
    "He said in a dry voice\n\nYes Ive always known that.",
    "She went on fiercely\n\nWhat do you think its been like all the evening sitting round with\nJohn dead and nobody caring but me and Gerda With you glad and\nDavid embarrassed and Midge distressed and Lucy delicately enjoying\nthe News of the World come from print into real life Cant you see how\nlike a fantastic nightmare it all is\n\nEdward said nothing.",
    "He stepped back a pace into shadows.",
    "Looking at him Henrietta said\n\nTonight  nothing seems real to me nobody is real  but John\n\nEdward said quietly I know...",
    "I am not very real...\n\nWhat a brute I am Edward But I cant help it.",
    "I cant help resenting\nthat John who was so alive is dead.",
    "And that I who am half dead am alive...",
    "I didnt mean that Edward.",
    "I think you did Henrietta...",
    "I think perhaps you are right.",
    "But she was saying thoughtfully harking back to an earlier thought\n\nBut it is not grief.",
    "Perhaps I cannot feel grief... Perhaps I never shall...\nAnd yet  I would like to grieve for John...",
    "Her words seemed to him fantastic.",
    "Yet he was even more startled\nwhen she added suddenly in an almost businesslike voice\n\nI must go to the swimming pool.",
    "She glided away through the trees.",
    "Walking stiffly Edward went through the open window.",
    "Midge looked up as Edward came through the window with unseeing\neyes.",
    "His face was grey and pinched.",
    "It looked bloodless.",
    "He did not hear the little gasp that Midge stifled immediately.",
    "Almost mechanically he walked to a chair and sat down.",
    "Aware of\nsomething expected of him he said\n\nIts cold...\n\nAre you very cold Edward Shall we  shall I  light a fire\n\nWhat\n\nMidge took a box of matches from the mantelpiece.",
    "She knelt down\nand set a match to the fire.",
    "She looked cautiously sideways at Edward.",
    "He was quite oblivious she thought of everything.",
    "She said A fire is nice.",
    "It warms one...\n\n\fHow cold he looks she thought.",
    "But it cant be as cold as that outside.",
    "Its Henrietta What has she said to him\n\nBring your chair nearer Edward.",
    "Come close to the fire.",
    "What\n\nYour chair.",
    "To the fire.",
    "She was talking to him now loudly and slowly as though to a deaf\nperson.",
    "And suddenly so suddenly that her heart turned over with relief\nEdward the real Edward was there again.",
    "Smiling at her gently.",
    "Have you been talking to me Midge Im sorry.",
    "Im afraid I was thinking of something.",
    "Oh it was nothing.",
    "Just the fire.",
    "The sticks were crackling and some fir cones were burning with a\nbright clear flame.",
    "Edward looked at them.",
    "He said\n\nIts a nice fire.",
    "He stretched out his long thin hands to the blaze aware of relief from\ntension.",
    "Midge said We always had fir cones at Ainswick...",
    "I still do.",
    "A basket of them is brought in every day and put by the\ngrate.",
    "Edward at Ainswick... Midge half closed her eyes picturing it.",
    "He\nwould sit she thought in the library on the west side of the house.",
    "There was a magnolia that almost covered one window and which\nfilled the room with a golden green light in the afternoons.",
    "Through the\nother window you looked out on the lawn and a tall Wellingtonia stood\nup like a sentinel.",
    "And to the right was the big copper beech.",
    "Oh Ainswick  Ainswick...\n\nShe could smell the soft air that drifted in from the magnolia which\nwould still in September have some great white sweetsmelling\nwaxy flowers on it... And the pine cones on the fire... and a faintly\nmusty smell from the kind of book that Edward was sure to be\nreading...",
    "He would be sitting in the saddleback chair and\noccasionally perhaps his eyes would go from the book to the fire and\nhe would think just for a minute of Henrietta...\n\nMidge stirred and asked\n\nWhere is Henrietta\n\nShe went to the swimming pool.",
    "Midge stared.",
    "Why\n\nHer voice abrupt and deep roused Edward a little.",
    "My dear Midge surely you knew  oh well  guessed.",
    "She knew\nChristow pretty well...\n\nOh of course one knew that But I dont see why she should go\nmooning off to where he was shot.",
    "Thats not at all like Henrietta.",
    "Shes\nnever melodramatic.",
    "Do any of us know what anyone else is like Henrietta for\ninstance...\n\nMidge frowned.",
    "She said\n\nAfter all Edward you and I have known Henrietta all our lives.",
    "She has changed.",
    "Not really.",
    "I dont think one changes.",
    "Henrietta has changed.",
    "Midge looked at him curiously.",
    "More than we have you and I\n\nOh I have stood still I know that well enough.",
    "And you \n\nHis eyes suddenly focusing looked at her where she knelt by the\nfender.",
    "It was as though he was looking at her from a long way off\ntaking in the square chin the dark eyes the resolute mouth.",
    "He said\n\n\fI wish I saw you more often Midge my dear.",
    "She smiled up at him.",
    "She said\n\nI know.",
    "It isnt easy these days to keep touch.",
    "There was a sound outside and Edward got up.",
    "Lucy was right he said.",
    "It has been a tiring day  ones first\nintroduction to murder I shall go to bed.",
    "Good night.",
    "He had left the room when Henrietta came through the window.",
    "Midge turned on her.",
    "What have you done to Edward\n\nEdward Henrietta was vague.",
    "Her forehead was puckered.",
    "She\nseemed to be thinking of something far away.",
    "Yes Edward.",
    "He came in looking dreadful  so cold and grey.",
    "If you care about Edward so much Midge why dont you do\nsomething about him\n\nDo something What do you mean\n\nI dont know.",
    "Stand on a chair and shout Draw attention to yourself.",
    "Dont you know thats the only hope with a man like Edward\n\n\fEdward will never care about anyone but you Henrietta.",
    "He never\nhas.",
    "Then its very unintelligent of him.",
    "She threw a quick glance at\nMidges white face.",
    "Ive hurt you.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "But I hate Edward tonight \n\nHate Edward You cant...\n\nOh yes I can You dont know \n\nWhat\n\nHenrietta said slowly\n\nHe reminds me of such a lot of things I would like to forget.",
    "What things\n\nWell Ainswick for instance.",
    "Ainswick You want to forget Ainswick\n\nMidges tone was incredulous.",
    "Yes yes yes I was happy there.",
    "I cant stand just now being\nreminded of happiness... Dont you understand A time when one\ndidnt know what was coming.",
    "When one said confidently everything is\ngoing to be lovely Some people are wise  they never expect to be\nhappy.",
    "I did.",
    "She said abruptly\n\nI shall never go back to Ainswick.",
    "Midge said slowly\n\nI wonder...\n\nChapter 14\n\nMidge woke up abruptly on Monday morning.",
    "For a moment she lay there bemused her eyes going confusedly\ntowards the door for she half expected Lady Angkatell to appear.",
    "What was it Lucy had said when she came drifting in that first\nmorning\n\nA difficult weekend She had been worried... had thought that\nsomething unpleasant might happen.",
    "Yes and something unpleasant\nhad happened  something that was lying now upon Midges heart and\nspirits like a thick black cloud.",
    "Something that she didnt want to think\nabout  didnt want to remember.",
    "Something surely that frightened\nher... Something to do with Edward... Memory came with a rush.",
    "One\nugly stark word  murder\n\nOh no thought Midge it cant be true.",
    "Its a dream Ive been having.",
    "John Christow murdered shot  lying there by the pool.",
    "Blood and\n\n\fblue water  like the jacket of a detective story...",
    "Fantastic unreal...",
    "The sort of thing that doesnt happen to oneself...",
    "If we were at\nAinswick now.",
    "It couldnt have happened at Ainswick.",
    "The black weight moved from her forehead.",
    "It settled instead in the pit\nof her stomach making her feel slightly sick.",
    "It was not a dream.",
    "It was a real happening  a News of the World\nhappening  and she and Edward and Lucy and Henry and Henrietta\nwere all mixed up with it.",
    "Unfair  surely unfair  since it was nothing to do with them if Gerda had\nshot her husband.",
    "Midge stirred uneasily.",
    "Quiet stupid slightly pathetic Gerda  you couldnt associate Gerda\nwith melodrama  with violence.",
    "Gerda surely couldnt shoot anybody.",
    "Again that inward uneasiness rose.",
    "No no one mustnt think like\nthat... Because who else could have shot John And Gerda had been\nstanding there by his body with the revolver in her hand.",
    "The revolver\nshe had taken from Henrys study.",
    "Gerda had said that she had found John dead and picked up the\nrevolver... Well what else could she say Shed have to say something\npoor thing...\n\n\fAll very well for Henrietta to defend her  to say that Gerdas story was\nperfectly possible.",
    "Henrietta hadnt considered the impossible\nalternatives.",
    "Henrietta had been very odd last night.",
    "But that of course had been the shock of John Christows death.",
    "Poor Henrietta  who had cared so terribly for John\n\nBut she would get over it in time  one got over everything.",
    "And then\nshe would marry Edward and live at Ainswick  and Edward would be\nhappy at last...\n\nHenrietta had always loved Edward very dearly.",
    "It was only the\naggressive dominant personality of John Christow that had come in\nthe way.",
    "He had made Edward look so  so pale by comparison.",
    "It struck Midge when she came down to breakfast that morning that\nalready Edwards personality freed from John Christows dominance\nhad begun to assert itself.",
    "He seemed more sure of himself less\nhesitant and retiring.",
    "He was talking pleasantly to the glowering and unresponsive David.",
    "You must come more often to Ainswick David.",
    "Id like you to feel at\nhome there and to get to know all about the place.",
    "Helping himself to marmalade David said coldly\n\n\fThese big estates are completely farcical.",
    "They should be split up.",
    "That wont happen in my time I hope said Edward smiling.",
    "My\ntenants are a contented lot.",
    "They shouldnt be said David.",
    "Nobody should be contented.",
    "If apes had been content with tails  murmured Lady Angkatell from\nwhere she was standing by the sideboard looking vaguely at a dish of\nkidneys.",
    "Thats a poem I learnt in the nursery but I simply cant\nremember how it goes on.",
    "I must have a talk with you David and learn\nall the new ideas.",
    "As far as I can see one must hate everybody but at\nthe same time give them free medical attention and a lot of extra\neducation poor things All those helpless little children herded into\nschoolhouses every day  and cod liver oil forced down babies throats\nwhether they like it or not  such nastysmelling stuff.",
    "Lucy Midge thought was behaving very much as usual.",
    "And Gudgeon when she passed him in the hall also looked just as\nusual.",
    "Life at The Hollow seemed to have resumed its normal course.",
    "With the departure of Gerda the whole business seemed like a dream.",
    "Then there was a scrunch of wheels on the gravel outside and Sir\nHenry drew up in his car.",
    "He had stayed the night at his club and\ndriven down early.",
    "Well dear said Lucy was everything all right\n\n\fYes.",
    "The secretary was there  competent sort of girl.",
    "She took\ncharge of things.",
    "Theres a sister it seems.",
    "The secretary telegraphed\nto her.",
    "I knew there would be said Lady Angkatell.",
    "At Tunbridge Wells\n\nBexhill I think said Sir Henry looking puzzled.",
    "I daresay  Lucy considered Bexhill.",
    "Yes  quite probably.",
    "Gudgeon approached.",
    "Inspector Grange telephoned Sir Henry.",
    "The inquest will be at eleven\noclock on Wednesday.",
    "Sir Henry nodded.",
    "Lady Angkatell said\n\nMidge youd better ring up your shop.",
    "Midge went slowly to the telephone.",
    "Her life had always been so entirely normal and commonplace that she\nfelt she lacked the phraseology to explain to her employer that after\nfour days holiday she was unable to return to work owing to the fact\nthat she was mixed up in a murder case.",
    "It did not sound credible.",
    "It did not even feel credible.",
    "And Madame Alfrege was not a very easy person to explain things to at\nany time.",
    "Midge set her chin resolutely and picked up the receiver.",
    "It was all just as unpleasant as she had imagined it would be.",
    "The\nraucous voice of the vitriolic little Jewess came angrily over the wires.",
    "What ith that Mith Hardcathtle A death A funeral Do you not know\nvery well I am shorthanded.",
    "Do you think I am going to stand for these\nexcutheth Oh yeth you are having a good time I darethay\n\nMidge interrupted speaking sharply and distinctly.",
    "The poleeth The poleeth you thay It was almost a scream.",
    "You\nare mixed up with the poleeth\n\nSetting her teeth Midge continued to explain.",
    "Strange how sordid that\nwoman at the other end made the whole thing seem.",
    "A vulgar police\ncase.",
    "What alchemy there was in human beings\n\nEdward opened the door and came in then seeing that Midge was\ntelephoning he was about to go out.",
    "She stopped him.",
    "Do stay Edward.",
    "Please.",
    "Oh I want you to.",
    "The presence of Edward in the room gave her strength  counteracted\nthe poison.",
    "She took her hand from where she had laid it over the receiver.",
    "What Yes.",
    "I am sorry Madam...",
    "But after all it is hardly my fault \n\n\fThe ugly raucous voice was screaming angrily\n\nWho are theethe friendth of yourth What thort of people are they to\nhave the poleeth there and a man shot.",
    "Ive a good mind not to have\nyou back at all I cant have the tone of my ethtablishment lowered.",
    "Midge made a few submissive noncommittal replies.",
    "She replaced the\nreceiver at last with a sigh of relief.",
    "She felt sick and shaken.",
    "Its the place I work she explained.",
    "I had to let them know that I\nwouldnt be back until Thursday because of the inquest and the  the\npolice.",
    "I hope they were decent about it What is it like this dress shop of\nyours Is the woman who runs it pleasant and sympathetic to work\nfor\n\nI should hardly describe her as that Shes a Whitechapel Jewess with\ndyed hair and a voice like a corncrake.",
    "But my dear Midge \n\nEdwards face of consternation almost made Midge laugh.",
    "He was so\nconcerned.",
    "But my dear child  you cant put up with that sort of thing.",
    "If you must\nhave a job you must take one where the surroundings are harmonious\nand where you like the people you are working with.",
    "Midge looked at him for a moment without answering.",
    "How explain she thought to a person like Edward What did Edward\nknow of the labour market of jobs\n\nAnd suddenly a tide of bitterness rose in her.",
    "Lucy Henry Edward yes even Henrietta  they were all divided from her by an impassable\ngulf  the gulf that separates the leisured from the working.",
    "They had no conception of the difficulties of getting a job and once\nyou had got it of keeping it One might say perhaps that there was no\nneed actually for her to earn her living.",
    "Lucy and Henry would gladly\ngive her a home  they would with equal gladness have made her an\nallowance.",
    "Edward would also willingly have done the latter.",
    "But something in Midge rebelled against the acceptance of ease\noffered her by her welltodo relations.",
    "To come on rare ocasions and\nsink into the wellordered luxury of Lucys life was delightful.",
    "She could\nrevel in that.",
    "But some sturdy independence of spirit held her back\nfrom accepting that life as a gift.",
    "The same feeling had prevented her\nfrom starting a business on her own with money borrowed from\nrelations and friends.",
    "She had seen too much of that.",
    "She would borrow no money  use no influence.",
    "She had found a job for\nherself at four pounds a week and if she had actually been given the\njob because Madame Alfrege hoped that Midge would bring her\nsmart friends to buy Madame Alfrege was disappointed.",
    "Midge\nsternly discouraged any such notion on the part of her friends.",
    "She had no particular illusions about working.",
    "She disliked the shop\nshe disliked Madame Alfrege she disliked the eternal subservience to\nilltempered and impolite customers but she doubted very much\nwhether she could obtain any other job which she would like better\nsince she had none of the necessary qualifications.",
    "Edwards assumption that a wide range of choice was open to her was\nsimply unbearably irritating this morning.",
    "What right had Edward to\nlive in a world so divorced from reality\n\nThey were Angkatells all of them And she  was only half an Angkatell\nAnd sometimes like this morning she did not feel like an Angkatell at\nall She was all her fathers daughter.",
    "She thought of her father with the usual pang of love and compunction\na greyhaired middleaged man with a tired face.",
    "A man who had\nstruggled for years running a small family business that was bound\nfor all his care and effort to go slowly down the hill.",
    "It was not\nincapacity on his part  it was the march of progress...\n\nStrangely enough it was not to her brilliant Angkatell mother but to\nher quiet tired father that Midges devotion had always been given.",
    "Each time when she came back from those visits to Ainswick which\nwere the wild delight of her life she would answer the faint deprecating\nquestion in her fathers tired face by flinging her arms round his neck\nand saying Im glad to be home  Im glad to be home.",
    "Her mother had died when Midge was thirteen.",
    "Sometimes Midge\nrealized that she knew very little about her mother.",
    "She had been\nvague charming gay.",
    "Had she regretted her marriage the marriage\n\n\fthat had taken her outside the circle of the Angkatell clan Midge had\nno idea.",
    "Her father had grown greyer and quieter after his wifes\ndeath.",
    "His struggles against the extinction of his business had grown\nmore unavailing.",
    "He had died quietly and inconspicuously when Midge\nwas eighteen.",
    "Midge had stayed with various Angkatell relations had accepted\npresents from the Angkatells had had good times with the Angkatells\nbut she had refused to be financially dependent on their good will.",
    "And\nmuch as she loved them there were times such as these when she felt\nsuddenly and violently divergent from them.",
    "She thought with rancour they dont know anything\n\nEdward sensitive as always was looking at her with a puzzled face.",
    "He asked gently\n\nIve upset you Why\n\nLucy drifted into the room.",
    "She was in the middle of one of her\nconversations.",
    "you see one doesnt really know whether shed prefer the White\nHart to us or not.",
    "Midge looked at her blankly  then at Edward.",
    "Its no use looking at Edward said Lady Angkatell.",
    "Edward simply\nwouldnt know you Midge are always so practical.",
    "I dont know what you are talking about Lucy.",
    "Lucy looked surprised.",
    "The inquest darling.",
    "Gerda has to come down for it.",
    "Should she stay\nhere Or go to the White Hart The associations here are painful of\ncourse  but then at the White Hart there will be people who will stare\nand quantities of reporters... Wednesday you know at eleven or is it\neleventhirty A smile lit up Lady Angkatells face.",
    "I have never been\nto an inquest I thought my grey  and a hat of course like church  but\nnot gloves \n\nYou know went on Lady Angkatell crossing the room and picking up\nthe telephone receiver and gazing down at it earnestly I dont believe\nIve got any gloves except gardening gloves nowadays And of course\nlots of long evening ones put away from the Government House days.",
    "Gloves are rather stupid dont you think so\n\nTheir only use is to avoid fingerprints in crimes said Edward\nsmiling.",
    "Now its very interesting that you should say that Edward  very\ninteresting  what am I doing with this thing Lady Angkatell looked at\nthe telephone receiver with faint distaste.",
    "Were you going to ring up someone\n\nI dont think so.",
    "Lady Angkatell shook her head vaguely and put the\nreceiver back on its stand very gingerly.",
    "She looked from Edward to Midge.",
    "I dont think Edward that you ought to upset Midge.",
    "Midge minds\nsudden deaths more than we do.",
    "My dear Lucy exclaimed Edward.",
    "I was only worrying about this\nplace where Midge works.",
    "It sounds all wrong to me.",
    "Edward thinks I ought to have a delightful sympathetic employer who\nwould appreciate me said Midge drily.",
    "Dear Edward said Lucy with complete appreciation.",
    "She smiled at Midge and went out again.",
    "Seriously Midge said Edward I am worried \n\nShe interrupted him\n\nThe damned woman pays me four pounds a week.",
    "Thats all that\nmatters.",
    "She brushed past him and went out into the garden.",
    "Sir Henry was sitting in his usual place on the low wall but Midge\nturned away and walked up towards the flower walk.",
    "Her relatives were charming but she had no use for their charm this\nmorning.",
    "David Angkatell was sitting on the seat at the top of the path.",
    "There was no overdone charm about David and Midge made straight\nfor him and sat down by him noting with malicious pleasure his look of\ndismay.",
    "How extraordinarily difficult it was thought David to get away from\npeople.",
    "He had been driven from his bedroom by the brisk incursion of\nhousemaids purposeful with mops and dusters.",
    "The library and the Encyclopaedia Britannica had not been the\nsanctuary he had hoped optimistically it might be.",
    "Twice Lady\nAngkatell had drifted in and out addressing him kindly with remarks to\nwhich there seemed no possible intelligent reply.",
    "He had come out here to brood upon his position.",
    "The mere weekend\nto which he had unwillingly committed himself had now lengthened\nout owing to the exigencies connected with sudden and violent death.",
    "David who preferred the contemplation of an Academic Past or the\nearnest discussion of a Left Wing Future had no aptitude for dealing\nwith a violent and realistic present.",
    "As he had told Lady Angkatell he\ndid not read the News of the World.",
    "But now the News of the World\nseemed to have come to The Hollow.",
    "Murder David shuddered distastefully.",
    "What would his friends think\nHow did one so to speak take murder What was ones attitude\nBored Disgusted Lightly amused\n\n\fTrying to settle these problems in his mind he was by no means\npleased to be disturbed by Midge.",
    "He looked at her uneasily as she sat\nbeside him.",
    "He was rather startled by the defiant stare with which she returned his\nlook.",
    "A disagreeable girl of no intellectual value.",
    "She said How do you like your relations\n\nDavid shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said\n\nDoes one really think about relations\n\nMidge said\n\nDoes one really think about anything\n\nDoubtless David thought she didnt.",
    "He said almost graciously\n\nI was analyzing my reactions to murder\n\nIt is certainly odd said Midge to be in one.",
    "David sighed and said\n\nWearisome... That was quite the best attitude.",
    "All the clich\u00e9s that\none thought existed only in the pages of detective fiction\n\nYou must be sorry you came said Midge.",
    "David sighed.",
    "Yes I might have been staying with a friend of mine in London.",
    "He\nadded He keeps a Left Wing bookshop.",
    "I expect its more comfortable here said Midge.",
    "Does one really care about being comfortable David asked\nscornfully.",
    "There are times said Midge when I feel I dont care about anything\nelse.",
    "The pampered attitude to life said David.",
    "If you were a worker \n\nMidge interrupted him.",
    "I am a worker.",
    "Thats just why being comfortable is so attractive.",
    "Box\nbeds down pillows  early morning tea softly deposited beside the bed\n a porcelain bath with lashings of hot water  and delicious bath salts.",
    "The kind of easy chair you really sink into...\n\nMidge paused in her catalogue.",
    "The workers said David should have all these things.",
    "But he was a little doubtful about the softly deposited early morning\ntea which sounded impossibly sybaritic for an earnestly organised\nworld.",
    "I couldnt agree with you more said Midge heartily.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nHercule Poirot enjoying a midmorning cup of chocolate was\ninterrupted by the ringing of the telephone.",
    "He got up and lifted the\nreceiver.",
    "Allo\n\nM. Poirot\n\nLady Angkatell\n\nHow nice of you to know my voice.",
    "Am I disturbing you\n\nBut not at all.",
    "You are I hope none the worse for the distressing\nevents of yesterday\n\nNo indeed.",
    "Distressing as you say but one feels I find quite\ndetached.",
    "I ring you up to know if you could possibly come over  an\nimposition I know but I am really in great distress...",
    "But certainly Lady Angkatell.",
    "Did you mean now\n\nWell yes I did mean now.",
    "As quickly as you can.",
    "Thats very sweet of\nyou.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I will come by the woods then\n\nOh of course  the shortest way.",
    "Thank you so much dear M. Poirot.",
    "Pausing only to brush a few specks of dust off the lapels of his coat\nand to slip on a thin overcoat Poirot crossed the lane and hurried\nalong the path through the chestnuts.",
    "The swimming pool was\ndeserted  the police had finished their work and gone.",
    "It looked\ninnocent and peaceful in the soft misty Autumnal light.",
    "Poirot took a quick look into the pavilion.",
    "The platinum fox cape he\nnoted had been removed.",
    "But the six boxes of matches still stood\nupon the table by the settee.",
    "He wondered more than ever about those\nmatches.",
    "It is not a place to keep matches  here in the damp.",
    "One box for\nconvenience perhaps  but not six.",
    "He frowned down on the painted iron table.",
    "The tray of glasses had\nbeen removed.",
    "Someone had scrawled with a pencil on the table  a\nrough design of a nightmarish tree.",
    "It pained Hercule Poirot.",
    "It\noffended his tidy mind.",
    "He clicked his tongue shook his head and hurried on towards the\nhouse wondering at the reason for this urgent summons.",
    "Lady Angkatell was waiting for him at the French windows and swept\nhim into the empty drawingroom.",
    "It was nice of you to come M. Poirot.",
    "She clasped his hand warmly.",
    "Madame I am at your service.",
    "Lady Angkatells hands floated out expressively.",
    "Her wide beautiful\neyes opened.",
    "You see its all so difficult.",
    "The Inspector person is interviewing no\nquestioning  taking a statement  what is the term they use Gudgeon.",
    "And really our whole life here depends on Gudgeon and\none does so sympathize with him.",
    "Because naturally it is terrible for\nhim to be questioned by the police  even Inspector Grange who I do\nfeel is really nice and probably a family man  boys I think and he\nhelps them with Meccano in the evenings  and a wife who has\neverything spotless but a little overcrowded...\n\nHercule Poirot blinked as Lady Angkatell developed her imaginary\nsketch of Inspector Granges home life.",
    "By the way his moustache droops went on Lady Angkatell I think\nthat a home that is too spotless might be sometimes depressing  like\nsoap on hospital nurses faces.",
    "Quite a shine But that is more abroad\nwhere things lag behind  in London nursing homes they have lots of\npowder and really vivid lipstick.",
    "But I was saying M. Poirot that you\nreally must come to lunch properly when all this ridiculous business is\nover.",
    "You are very kind.",
    "I do not mind the police myself said Lady Angkatell.",
    "I really find it\nall quite interesting.",
    "Do let me help you in any way I can I said to\nInspector Grange.",
    "He seems rather a bewildered sort of person but\nmethodical.",
    "Motive seems so important to policemen she went on.",
    "Talking of\nhospital nurses just now I believe that John Christow  a nurse with\nred hair and an upturned nose  quite attractive.",
    "But of course it was\na long time ago and the police might not be interested.",
    "One doesnt\nreally know how much poor Gerda had to put up with.",
    "She is the loyal\ntype dont you think Or possibly she believed what is told her.",
    "I think\nif one has not a great deal of intelligence it is wise to do that.",
    "Quite suddenly Lady Angkatell flung open the study door and ushered\nPoirot in crying brightly Here is M. Poirot.",
    "She swept round him and out shutting the door.",
    "Inspector Grange and\nGudgeon were sitting by the desk.",
    "A young man with a notebook was\nin a corner.",
    "Gudgeon rose respectfully to his feet.",
    "Poirot hastened into apologies.",
    "I retire immediately.",
    "I assure you I had no idea that Lady Angkatell \n\nNo no you wouldnt have.",
    "Granges moustache looked more\npessimistic\n\nthan\n\never\n\nthis morning.",
    "Perhaps\n\nthought\n\nPoirot\n\nfascinated by Lady Angkatells recent sketch of Grange there has\nbeen too much cleaning or perhaps a Benares brass table has been\n\n\fpurchased so that the good Inspector he really cannot have space to\nmove.",
    "Angrily he dismissed these thoughts.",
    "Inspector Granges clean but\novercrowded home his wife his boys and their addiction to Meccano\nwere all figments of Lady Angkatells busy brain.",
    "But the vividness with which they assumed concrete reality interested\nhim.",
    "It was quite an accomplishment.",
    "Sit down M. Poirot said Grange.",
    "Theres something I want to ask\nyou about and Ive nearly finished here.",
    "He turned his attention back to Gudgeon who deferentially and almost\nunder protest resumed his seat and turned an expressionless face\ntowards his interlocutor.",
    "And thats all you can remember\n\nYes sir.",
    "Everything sir was very much as usual.",
    "There was no\nunpleasantness of any kind.",
    "Theres a fur cape thing  out in that summer house by the pool.",
    "Which\nof the ladies did it belong to\n\nAre you referring sir to a cape of platinum fox I noticed it yesterday\nwhen I took out the glasses to the pavilion.",
    "But it is not the property of\nanyone in this house sir.",
    "Whose is it then\n\n\fIt might possibly belong to Miss Cray sir.",
    "Miss Veronica Cray the\nmotion picture actress.",
    "She was wearing something of the kind.",
    "When\n\nWhen she was here the night before last sir.",
    "You didnt mention her as having been a guest here.",
    "She was not a guest sir.",
    "Miss Cray lives at Dovecotes the  er cottage up the lane and she came over after dinner having run out of\nmatches to borrow some.",
    "Did she take away six boxes asked Poirot.",
    "Gudgeon turned to him.",
    "That is correct sir.",
    "Her ladyship after having inquired if we had\nplenty insisted on Miss Cray s taking half a dozen boxes.",
    "Which she left in the pavilion said Poirot.",
    "Yes sir I observed them there yesterday morning.",
    "There is not much that that man does not observe remarked Poirot\nas Gudgeon departed closing the door softly and deferentially behind\nhim.",
    "Inspector Grange merely remarked that servants were the devil\n\n\fHowever he said with a little renewed cheerfulness theres always\nthe kitchen maid.",
    "Kitchen maids talk  not like these stuckup upper\nservants.",
    "Ive put a man on to make inquiries at Harley Street he went on and\nI shall be there myself later in the day.",
    "We ought to get something\nthere.",
    "Daresay you know that wife of Christows had a good bit to put\nup with.",
    "Some of these fashionable doctors and their lady patients well youd be surprised And I gather from Lady Angkatell that there\nwas some trouble over a hospital nurse.",
    "Of course she was very\nvague about it.",
    "Poirot agreed.",
    "She would be vague...",
    "Yes a skilfull built up picture... John Christow and amorous intrigues\nwith hospital nurses... the opportunities of a doctors life... plenty of\nreasons for Gerda Christows jealousy which had culminated at last in\nmurder...",
    "Yes a skilfully suggested picture... drawing attention to a Harley\nStreet background  away from The Hollow  away from the moment\nwhen Henrietta Savernake stepping forward had taken the revolver\nfrom Gerda Christows unresisting hand... away from that other\nmoment when John Christow dying had said Henrietta...",
    "Suddenly opening his eyes which had been half closed Hercule Poirot\ndemanded with irresistible curiosity\n\nDo your boys play with Meccano\n\n\fEh what Inspector Grange came back from a frowning reverie to\nstare at Poirot.",
    "Why what on earth As a matter of fact theyre a bit\nyoung  but I was thinking of giving Teddy a Meccano set for\nChristmas.",
    "What made you ask\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "What made Lady Angkatell dangerous he thought was the fact that\nthose intuitive wild guesses of hers might often be right... With a\ncareless seemingly careless word she built up a picture  and if part\nof the picture was right wouldnt you in spite of yourself believe in\nthe other half of the picture...",
    "Inspector Grange was speaking.",
    "Theres a point I want to put to you M. Poirot.",
    "This Miss Cray the\nactress  she traipses over here borrowing matches.",
    "If she wanted to\nborrow matches why didnt she come to your place only a step or two\naway Why come about half a mile\n\nHercule Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "There might be reasons.",
    "Snob reasons shall we say My little\ncottage it is small unimportant.",
    "I am only a weekender but Sir Henry\nand Lady Angkatell are important  they live here  they are what is\ncalled gentry in the county.",
    "This Miss Veronica Cray she may have\nwanted to get to know them  and after all this was a way.",
    "Inspector Grange got up.",
    "Yes he said thats perfectly possible of course but one doesnt\nwant to overlook anything.",
    "Still Ive no doubt that everythings going to\nbe plain sailing.",
    "Sir Henry has identified the gun as one of his\ncollection.",
    "It seems they were actually practising with it the afternoon\nbefore.",
    "All Mrs. Christow had to do was to go into the study and get it\nfrom where shed seen Sir Henry put it and the ammunition away.",
    "Its\nall quite simple.",
    "Yes Poirot murmured.",
    "It seems all quite simple.",
    "Just so he thought would a woman like Gerda Christow commit a\ncrime.",
    "Without subterfuge or complexity  driven suddenly to violence\nby the bitter anguish of a narrow but deeply loving nature...\n\nAnd yet surely  surely she would have had some sense of selfpreservation.",
    "Or had she acted in that blindness  that darkness of the\nspirit  when reason is entirely laid aside\n\nHe recalled her blank dazed face.",
    "He did not know  he simply did not know.",
    "But he felt that he ought to know.",
    "Chapter 16\n\n\fGerda Christow pulled the black dress up over her head and let it fall\non a chair.",
    "Her eyes were piteous with uncertainty.",
    "She said I dont know...",
    "I really dont know...",
    "Nothing seems to\nmatter.",
    "I know dear I know.",
    "Mrs. Patterson was kind but firm.",
    "She knew\nexactly how to treat people who had had a bereavement.",
    "Elsie is\nwonderful in a crisis her family said of her.",
    "At the present moment she was sitting in her sister Gerda s bedroom\nin Harley Street being wonderful.",
    "Elsie Patters on was tall and spare\nwith an energetic manner.",
    "She was looking now at Gerda with a\nmixture of irritation and compassion.",
    "Poor dear Gerda  tragic for her to lose her husband in such an awful\nway  and really even now she didnt seem to take in the  well the\nimplications properly Of course Mrs. Patterson reflected Gerda\nalways was terribly slow.",
    "And there was shock too to take into\naccount.",
    "She said in a brisk voice I think I should decide on that black\nmarocain at twelve guineas.",
    "One always did have to make up Gerdas mind for her.",
    "Gerda stood\nmotionless her brow puckered.",
    "She said hesitantly\n\n\fI dont really know if John liked mourning.",
    "I think I once heard him say\nhe didnt...\n\nJohn she thought.",
    "If only John were here to tell me what to do.",
    "But John would never be there again.",
    "Never  never  never... Mutton\ngetting cold  congealing on the table... the bang of the consulting\nroom door John running up two steps at a time always in a hurry so\nvital so alive...",
    "Alive...",
    "Lying on his back by the swimming pool... the slow drip of blood over\nthe edge... the feel of the revolver in her hand...\n\nA nightmare a bad dream presently she would wake up and none of it\nwould be true...",
    "Her sisters crisp voice came cutting through her nebulous thoughts.",
    "You must have something black for the inquest.",
    "It would look most\nodd if you turned up in bright blue.",
    "Gerda said That awful inquest and half shut her eyes.",
    "Terrible for you darling said Elsie Patterson quickly.",
    "But after it is\nall over you will come straight down to us and we shall take great care\nof you.",
    "The nebulous blur of Gerda Christows thoughts hardened.",
    "She said\nand her voice was frightened almost panic stricken\n\nWhat am I going to do without John\n\nElsie Patterson knew the answer to that one.",
    "Youve got your\nchildren.",
    "Youve got to live for them.",
    "Zena sobbing and crying... My Daddys dead Throwing herself on\nher bed.",
    "Terry pale inquiring shedding no tears...\n\nAn accident with a revolver she had told them  poor Daddy has had\nan accident.",
    "Beryl Collins so thoughtful of her had confiscated the morning papers\nso that the children should not see them.",
    "She had warned the\nservants too.",
    "Really Beryl had been most kind and thoughtful...\n\nTerence coming to his mother in the dim drawingroom.",
    "His lips\npursed close together his face almost greenish in its odd pallor.",
    "Why was Father shot\n\nAn accident dear.",
    "I  I cant talk about it.",
    "It wasnt an accident.",
    "Why do you say what isnt true Father was\nkilled.",
    "It was murder.",
    "The paper says so.",
    "Terry how did you get hold of a paper I told Miss Collins \n\n\fHe had nodded  queer repeated nods like a very old man.",
    "I went out and bought one of course.",
    "I knew there must be something\nin them that you werent telling us or else why did Miss Collins hide\nthem\n\nIt was never any good hiding truth from Terence.",
    "That queer\ndetached scientific curiosity of his had always to be satisfied.",
    "Why was he killed Mother\n\nShe had broken down then becoming hysterical.",
    "Dont ask me about it  dont talk about it  I cant talk about it... its all\ntoo dreadful.",
    "But theyll find out wont they I mean they have to find out.",
    "Its\nnecessary.",
    "So reasonable so detached...",
    "It made Gerda want to scream and\nlaugh and cry.",
    "She thought He doesnt care  he cant care  he just\ngoes on asking questions.",
    "Why he hasnt cried even.",
    "Terence had gone away evading his Aunt Elsies ministrations a\nlonely little boy with a stiff pinched face.",
    "He had always felt alone.",
    "But\nit hadnt mattered until today.",
    "Today he thought was different.",
    "If only there was someone who would\nanswer questions reasonably and intelligently.",
    "Tomorrow Tuesday he and Nicholson Minor were going to make\nnitroglycerine.",
    "He had been looking forward to it with a thrill.",
    "The thrill\nhad gone.",
    "He didnt care if he never made nitroglycerine.",
    "Terence felt almost shocked at himself.",
    "Not to care any more about\nscientific experiment But when a chaps father had been murdered...",
    "He thought My father  murdered...\n\nAnd something stirred  took root  grew... a slow anger.",
    "Beryl Collier tapped on the bedroom door and came in.",
    "She was pale\ncomposed efficient.",
    "She said\n\nInspector Grange is here.",
    "And as Gerda gasped and looked at her\npiteously Beryl went on quickly He said there was no need for him to\nworry you.",
    "Hell have a word with you before he goes but it is just\nroutine questions about Dr. Christows practice and I can tell him\neverything he wants to know.",
    "Oh thank you Collie.",
    "Beryl made a rapid exit and Gerda sighed out\n\nCollie is such a help.",
    "Shes so practical.",
    "Yes indeed said Mrs. Patterson.",
    "An excellent secretary Im sure.",
    "Very plain poor girl isnt she Oh well I always think thats just as\nwell.",
    "Especially with an attractive man like John was.",
    "Gerda flamed out at her\n\nWhat do you mean Elsie John would never  he never  you talk as\nthough John would have flirted or something horrid if he had had a\npretty secretary.",
    "John wasnt like that at all.",
    "Of course not darling said Mrs. Patterson.",
    "But after all one knows\nwhat men are like\n\nIn the consulting room Inspector Grange faced the cool belligerent\nglance of Beryl Collier.",
    "It was belligerent he noted that.",
    "Well perhaps\nthat was only natural.",
    "Plain bit of goods he thought.",
    "Nothing between her and the doctor I\nshouldnt think.",
    "She may have been sweet on him though.",
    "It works that\nway sometimes.",
    "But not this time he came to the conclusion when he leaned back in\nhis chair a quarter of an hour later.",
    "Beryl Colliers answers to his\nquestions had been models of clearness.",
    "She replied promptly and\nobviously had every detail of the doctors practice at her fingertips.",
    "He\nshifted his ground and began to probe gently into the relations existing\nbetween John Christow and his wife.",
    "They had been Beryl said on excellent terms.",
    "I suppose they\nquarrelled every now and then like most married couples The\nInspector sounded easy and confidential.",
    "I do not remember any quarrels.",
    "Mrs. Christow was quite devoted to\nher husband  really quite slavishly so.",
    "There was a faint edge of contempt in her voice.",
    "Inspector Grange\nheard it.",
    "Bit of a feminist this girl he thought.",
    "Aloud he said\n\nDidnt stand up for herself at all\n\nNo.",
    "Everything revolved round Dr. Christow.",
    "Tyrannical eh\n\nBeryl considered.",
    "No I wouldnt say that...",
    "But he was what I should call a very selfish\nman.",
    "He took it for granted that Mrs. Christow would always fall in with\nhis ideas.",
    "Any difficulties with patients  women I mean You neednt mind\nabout being frank Miss Collier.",
    "One knows doctors have their\ndifficulties in that line.",
    "Oh that sort of thing Beryls voice was scornful.",
    "Dr. Christow was\nquite equal to dealing with any difficulties in that line.",
    "He had an\nexcellent manner with patients.",
    "She added He was really a\nwonderful doctor.",
    "There was an almost grudging admiration in her voice.",
    "Grange said Was he tangled up with any woman Dont be loyal Miss\nCollier its important that we should know.",
    "Yes I can appreciate that.",
    "Not to my knowledge.",
    "A little too brusque he thought.",
    "She doesnt know but perhaps she\nguesses...",
    "He said sharply What about Miss Henrietta Savernake\n\nBeryls lips closed tightly.",
    "She was a close friend of the familys.",
    "No  trouble between Dr. and Mrs. Christow on her account\n\nCertainly not.",
    "The answer was emphatic.",
    "Overemphatic\n\nThe Inspector shifted his ground.",
    "What about Miss Veronica Cray\n\nVeronica Cray\n\nThere was pure astonishment in Beryls voice.",
    "She was a friend of Dr. Christows was she not\n\nI never heard of her.",
    "At least I seem to know the name \n\nThe motion picture actress.",
    "Beryls brow cleared.",
    "Of course I wondered why the name was familiar.",
    "But I didnt even\nknow that Dr. Christow knew her.",
    "She seemed so positive on the point that the Inspector abandoned it at\nonce.",
    "He went on to question her about Dr. Christows manner on the\npreceding Saturday.",
    "And here for the first time the confidence of\nBeryls replies wavered.",
    "She said slowly\n\nHis manner wasnt quite as usual.",
    "What was the difference\n\nHe seemed distrait.",
    "There was quite a long gap before he rang for his\nlast patient  and yet normally he was always in a hurry to get through\nwhen he was going away.",
    "I thought  yes I definitely thought he had\nsomething on his mind.",
    "But she could not be more definite.",
    "Inspector Grange was not very satisfied with his investigations.",
    "Hed\ncome nowhere near establishing motive  and motive had to be\nestablished before there was a case to go to the Public Prosecutor.",
    "He was quite certain in his own mind that Gerda Christow had shot her\nhusband.",
    "He suspected jealousy as the motive  but so far he had\nfound nothing to go on.",
    "Sergeant Coombes had been working on the\nmaids but they all told the same story.",
    "Mrs. Christow worshipped the\nground her husband walked on.",
    "Whatever happened he thought must have happened down at The\nHollow.",
    "And remembering The Hollow he felt a vague disquietude.",
    "They were an odd lot down there.",
    "The telephone on the desk rang and Miss Collier picked up the\nreceiver.",
    "She said Its for you Inspector and passed the instrument to him.",
    "Hullo Grange here... Whats that... Beryl heard the alteration in his\ntone and looked at him curiously.",
    "The woodenlooking face was\nimpassive as ever.",
    "He was grunting  listening \n\nYes yes Ive got that... Thats absolutely certain is it No margin of\nerror...",
    "Yes... yes... yes Ill be down.",
    "Ive about finished here...",
    "Yes.",
    "He put the receiver back and sat for a moment motionless.",
    "Beryl\nlooked at him curiously.",
    "He pulled himself together and asked in a voice that was quite different\nfrom the voice of his previous questions\n\nYouve no ideas of your own I suppose Miss Collier about this\nmatter\n\nYou mean \n\nI mean no ideas as to who it was killed Dr. Christow\n\nShe said flatly\n\nIve absolutely no idea at all Inspector.",
    "Grange said slowly\n\nWhen the body was found Mrs. Christow was standing beside it with\nthe revolver in her hand \n\nHe left it purposely as an unfinished sentence.",
    "Her reaction came promptly.",
    "Not heated cool and judicial.",
    "If you think Mrs. Christow killed her husband I am quite sure you are\nwrong.",
    "Mrs. Christow is not at all a violent woman.",
    "She is very meek\nand submissive and she was entirely under the doctors thumb.",
    "It\nseems to me quite ridiculous that anyone could imagine for a moment\nthat she shot him however much appearances may be against her.",
    "Then if she didnt who did he asked sharply.",
    "Beryl said slowly Ive no idea...",
    "The Inspector moved to the door.",
    "Beryl asked\n\nDo you want to see Mrs. Christow before you go\n\nNo  yes perhaps Id better.",
    "Again Beryl wondered this was not the same man who had been\nquestioning her before the telephone rang.",
    "What news had he got that\nhad altered him so much\n\nGerda came into the room nervously.",
    "She looked unhappy and\nbewildered.",
    "She said in a low shaky voice\n\nHave you found out any more about who killed John\n\nNot yet Mrs. Christow.",
    "Its so impossible  so absolutely impossible.",
    "But it happened Mrs. Christow.",
    "She nodded looking down screwing a handkerchief into a little ball.",
    "He said quietly\n\nHad your husband any enemies Mrs. Christow\n\n\fJohn Oh no.",
    "He was wonderful.",
    "Everyone adored him.",
    "You cant think of anyone who had a grudge against him he paused\nor against you\n\nAgainst me She seemed amazed.",
    "Oh no Inspector.",
    "Inspector Grange sighed.",
    "What about Miss Veronica Cray\n\nVeronica Cray Oh you mean the one who came that night to borrow\nmatches\n\nYes thats the one.",
    "You knew her\n\nGerda shook her head.",
    "Id never seen her before.",
    "John knew her years ago  or so she said.",
    "I suppose she might have had a grudge against him that you didnt\nknow about\n\nGerda said with dignity\n\nI dont believe anybody could have had a grudge against John.",
    "He\nwas the kindest and most unselfish  oh and one of the noblest men.",
    "Hm said the Inspector.",
    "Yes.",
    "Quite so.",
    "Well good morning Mrs.\nChristow.",
    "You understand\n\nabout\n\nthe\n\ninquest\n\nEleven\n\noclock\n\n\fWednesday in Market Depleach.",
    "It will be very simple  nothing to\nupset you  probably be adjourned for a week so that we can make\nfurther inquiries.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Thank you.",
    "She stood there staring after him.",
    "He wondered whether even now\nshe had grasped the fact that she was the principal suspect.",
    "He hailed a taxi  justifiable expense in view of the piece of information\nhe had just been given over the telephone.",
    "Just where that piece of\ninformation was leading him be did not know.",
    "On the face of it it\nseemed completely irrelevant  crazy.",
    "It simply did not make sense.",
    "But in some way that he could not yet see it must make sense.",
    "The only inference to be drawn from it was that the case was not quite\nthe simple straightforward one that he had hitherto assumed it to be.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nSir Henry stared curiously at Inspector Grange.",
    "He said slowly Im\nnot quite sure that I understand you Inspector.",
    "Its quite simple Sir Henry.",
    "Im asking you to check over your\ncollection of firearms.",
    "I presume they are catalogued and indexed\n\nNaturally.",
    "But I have already identified the revolver as part of my\ncollection.",
    "It isnt quite so simple as that Sir Henry.",
    "Grange paused a moment.",
    "His instincts were always against giving out any information but his\nhand was being forced in this particular instance.",
    "Sir Henry was a\nperson of importance.",
    "He would doubtless comply with the request\nthat was being made to him but he would also require a reason.",
    "The\nInspector decided that he had got to give him the reason.",
    "He said quietly\n\nDr. Christow was not shot with the revolver you identified this\nmorning.",
    "Sir Henrys eyebrows rose.",
    "Remarkable he said.",
    "Grange felt vaguely comforted.",
    "Remarkable was exactly what he felt\nhimself.",
    "He was grateful to Sir Henry for saying so and equally\ngrateful for his not saying any more.",
    "It was as far as they could go at\nthe moment.",
    "The thing was remarkable  and beyond that simply did\nnot make sense.",
    "Sir Henry asked\n\nHave you any reason to believe that the weapon from which the fatal\nshot was fired comes from my collection\n\nNo reason at all.",
    "But I have got to make sure shall we say that it\ndoesnt.",
    "Sir Henry nodded his head in confirmation.",
    "I appreciate your point.",
    "Well we will get to work.",
    "It will take a little\ntime.",
    "He opened the desk and took out a leatherbound volume.",
    "As he opened it he repeated\n\nIt will take a little time to check up \n\nGranges attention was held by something in his voice.",
    "He looked up\nsharply.",
    "Sir Henrys shoulders sagged a little  he seemed suddenly an\nolder and more tired man.",
    "Inspector Grange frowned.",
    "He thought Devil if I know what to make of these people down here...\n\nAh \n\nGrange spun round.",
    "His eyes noted the time by the clock thirty\nminutes  twenty minutes  since Sir Henry had said It will take a little\ntime...\n\nGrange said sharply\n\nYes sir\n\n\fA .38 Smith  Wesson is missing.",
    "It was in a brown leather holster and\nwas at the end of the rack in this drawer.",
    "Ah The Inspector kept his voice calm but he was excited.",
    "And\nwhen sir to your certain knowledge did you last see it in its proper\nplace\n\nSir Henry reflected for a moment or two.",
    "That is not very easy to say Inspector.",
    "I last had this drawer open\nabout a week ago and I think  I am almost certain  that if the revolver\nhad been missing then I should have noticed the gap.",
    "But I should not\nlike to swear definitely that I saw it there.",
    "Inspector Grange nodded his head.",
    "Thank you sir I quite understand... Well I must be getting on with\nthings \n\nHe left the room  a busy purposeful man.",
    "Sir Henry stood motionless for a while after the Inspector had gone\nthen he went out slowly through the French windows onto the terrace.",
    "His wife was busy with a gardening basket and gloves.",
    "She was\ntrimming some rare shrubs with a pair of scissors.",
    "She waved to him brightly.",
    "What did the Inspector want I hope he is not going to worry the\nservants again.",
    "You know Henry they dont like it.",
    "They cant see it as\namusing or as a novelty like we do.",
    "Do we see it like that\n\nHis tone attracted her attention.",
    "She smiled up at him sweetly.",
    "How tired you look Henry.",
    "Must you let all this worry you so much\n\nMurder is worrying Lucy.",
    "Lady Angkatell considered a moment absently dipping off some\nbranches then her face clouded over.",
    "Oh dear  that is the worst of scissors they are so fascinating  one\ncant stop and one always clips off more than one means.",
    "What was it\nyou were saying  something about murder being worrying But really\nHenry I have never seen why.",
    "I mean if one has to die it may be\ncancer or tuberculosis in one of those dreadful bright sanatoriums or\na stroke  horrid with ones face all on one side  or else one is shot or\nstabbed or strangled perhaps  but the whole thing comes to the same\nin the end.",
    "There one is I mean dead Out of it all.",
    "And all the worry\nover.",
    "And the relations have all the difficulties  money quarrels and\nwhether to wear black or not  and who was to have Aunt Selinas\nwriting desk  things like that\n\nSir Henry sat down on the stone coping.",
    "He said\n\nThis is all going to be more upsetting than we thought Lucy.",
    "Well darling we shall have to bear it.",
    "And when its all over we might\ngo away somewhere.",
    "Lets not bother about present troubles but look\nforward to the future.",
    "I really am happy about that.",
    "Ive been\nwondering whether it would be nice to go to Ainswick for Christmas or leave it until Easter.",
    "What do you think\n\nPlenty of time to make plans for Christmas.",
    "Yes but I like to see things in my mind.",
    "Easter perhaps...",
    "Yes Lucy\nsmiled happily she will certainly have got over it by then.",
    "Who Sir Henry was startled.",
    "Lady Angkatell said calmly\n\nHenrietta...",
    "I think if they were to have the wedding in October October of next year I mean then we could go and stop for that\nChristmas.",
    "Ive been thinking Henry \n\nI wish you wouldnt my dear.",
    "You think too much.",
    "You know the barn It will make a perfect studio.",
    "And Henrietta will\nneed a studio.",
    "She has real talent you know.",
    "Edward I am sure will be\nimmensely proud of her.",
    "Two boys and a girl would be nice  or two\nboys and two girls \n\nLucy  Lucy How you run on.",
    "But darling Lady Angkatell opened wide beautiful eyes Edward\nwill never marry anyone but Henrietta  he is very very obstinate.",
    "Rather like my father in that way.",
    "He gets an idea in his head So of\ncourse Henrietta must marry him  and she will now that John\nChristow is out of the way.",
    "He was really the greatest misfortune that\ncould possibly have happened to her.",
    "Poor devil\n\nWhy Oh you mean because hes dead Oh well everyone has to die\nsometime.",
    "I never worry over people dying...",
    "He looked at her curiously.",
    "I always thought you liked Christow Lucy\n\nI found him amusing.",
    "And he had charm.",
    "But I never think one ought\nto attach too much importance to anybody.",
    "And gently with a smiling face Lady Angkatell clipped remorselessly\nat a vine.",
    "Chapter 18\n\nHercule Poirot looked out of his window and saw Henrietta Savernake\nwalking up the path to the front door.",
    "She was wearing the same green\ntweeds that she had worn on the day of the tragedy.",
    "There was a\nspaniel with her.",
    "He hastened to the front door and opened it.",
    "She stood smiling at him.",
    "May I come in and see your house I like looking at peoples houses.",
    "Im just taking the dog for a walk.",
    "But most certainly.",
    "How English it is to take the dog for a walk\n\nI know said Henrietta.",
    "I thought of that.",
    "Do you know that nice\npoem The days passed slowly one by one.",
    "I fed the ducks reproved\nmy wife played H\u00e4ndels Largo on the fife And took the dog a run.",
    "Again she smiled  a brilliant unsubstantial smile.",
    "Poirot ushered her\ninto his sitting room.",
    "She looked round its neat and prim arrangement\nand nodded her head.",
    "Nice she said two of everything.",
    "How you would hate my studio.",
    "Why should I hate it\n\nOh a lot of clay sticking to things  and here and there just one thing\nthat I happen to like and which would be ruined if there were two of\nthem.",
    "But I can understand that Mademoiselle.",
    "You are an artist.",
    "Arent you an artist too M. Poirot\n\nPoirot put his head on one side.",
    "It is a question that.",
    "But on the whole I would say no.",
    "I have known\ncrimes that were artistic  they were you understand supreme\nexercises of imagination  but the solving of them  no it is not the\ncreative power that is needed.",
    "What is required is a passion for the\ntruth.",
    "A passion for the truth said Henrietta meditatively.",
    "Yes I can see\nhow dangerous that might make you.",
    "Would the truth satisfy you\n\nHe looked at her curiously.",
    "What do you mean Miss Savernake\n\nI can understand that you would want to know.",
    "But would knowledge\nbe enough Would you have to go a step further and translate\nknowledge into action\n\nHe was interested in her approach.",
    "You are suggesting that if I knew the truth about Dr. Christow s death\n I might be satisfied to keep that knowledge to myself.",
    "Do you know\nthe truth about his death\n\nHenrietta shrugged her shoulders.",
    "The obvious answer seems to be Gerda.",
    "How cynical it is that a wife\nor  a husband is always the first suspect.",
    "But you do not agree\n\n\fI always like to keep an open mind.",
    "Poirot said quietly\n\nWhy did you come here Miss Savernake\n\nI must admit that I havent your passion for truth M. Poirot.",
    "Taking the\ndog for a walk was such a nice English countryside excuse.",
    "But of\ncourse the Angkatells havent got a dog  as you may have noticed the\nother day.",
    "The fact had not escaped me.",
    "So I borrowed the gardeners spaniel.",
    "I am not you must understand\nM. Poirot very truthful.",
    "Again that brilliant brittle smile flashed out.",
    "He wondered why he\nshould suddenly find it unendurably moving He said quietly\n\nNo but you have integrity.",
    "Why on earth do you say that\n\nShe was startled  almost he thought dismayed.",
    "Because I believe it to be true.",
    "Integrity Henrietta repeated thoughtfully.",
    "I wonder what that word\nreally means...\n\n\fShe sat very still staring down at the carpet then she raised her head\nand looked at him steadily.",
    "Dont you want to know why I did come\n\nYou find a difficulty perhaps in putting it into words.",
    "Yes I think I do...",
    "The inquest M. Poirot is tomorrow.",
    "One has to\nmake up ones mind just how much \n\nShe broke off.",
    "Getting up she wandered across to the mantelpiece\ndisplaced one or two of the ornaments and moved a vase of\nMichaelmas daisies from its position in the middle of a table to the\nextreme corner of the mantelpiece.",
    "She stepped back eyeing the\narrangement with her head on one side.",
    "How do you like that M. Poirot\n\nNot at all Mademoiselle.",
    "I thought you wouldnt.",
    "She laughed moved everything quickly and\ndeftly back to their original positions.",
    "Well if one wants to say a thing one has to say it You are somehow\nthe sort of person one can talk to.",
    "Here goes.",
    "Is it necessary do you\nthink that the police should know that I was John Christows\nmistress\n\nHer voice was quite dry and unemotional.",
    "She was looking not at him\nbut at the wall over his head.",
    "With one forefinger she was following the\n\n\fcurve of the jar that held the purple flowers.",
    "He had an idea that in the\ntouch of that finger was her emotional outlet.",
    "Hercule Poirot said precisely and also without emotion\n\nI see.",
    "You were lovers\n\nIf you prefer to put it like that.",
    "He looked at her curiously.",
    "It was not how you put it Mademoiselle.",
    "No.",
    "Why not\n\nHenrietta shrugged her shoulders.",
    "She came and sat down by him on\nthe sofa.",
    "She said slowly\n\nOne likes to describe things as  as accurately as possible.",
    "His interest in Henrietta Savernake grew stronger.",
    "He said\n\nYou had been Dr. Christows mistress  for how long\n\nAbout six months.",
    "The police will have I gather no difficulty in discovering the fact\n\n\fHenrietta considered.",
    "I imagine not.",
    "That is if they are looking for something of that kind\n\nOh they will be looking I can assure you of that.",
    "Yes I rather thought they would.",
    "She paused stretched out her\nfingers on her knee and looked at them then gave him a swift friendly\nglance.",
    "Well M. Poirot what does one do Go to Inspector Grange\nand say  what does one say to a moustache like that Its such a\ndomestic family moustache.",
    "Poirots hand crawled upwards to his own proudly borne adornment.",
    "Whereas mine Mademoiselle\n\nYour moustache.",
    "M. Poirot is an artistic triumph.",
    "It has no\nassociations with anything but itself.",
    "It is I am sure unique.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "And it is probably the reason why I am talking to you as I am.",
    "Granted\nthat the police have to know the truth about John and myself will it\nnecessarily have to be made public\n\nThat depends said Poirot.",
    "If the police think it has no bearing on\nthe case they will be quite discreet.",
    "You  are very anxious on this\npoint\n\n\fHenrietta nodded.",
    "She stared down at her fingers for a moment or two\nthen suddenly lifted her head and spoke.",
    "Her voice was no longer dry\nand light.",
    "Why should things be made worse than they are for poor Gerda She\nadored John and hes dead.",
    "Shes lost him.",
    "Why should she have to\nbear an added burden\n\nIt is for her that you mind\n\nDo you think that is hypocritical I suppose youre thinking that if I\ncared at all about Gerdas peace of mind I would never have become\nJohns mistress.",
    "But you dont understand  it was not like that.",
    "I did\nnot break up his married life.",
    "I was only one  of a procession.",
    "Ah it was like that\n\nShe turned on him sharply\n\nNo no no Not what you are thinking.",
    "Thats what I mind most of all\nThe false idea that everybody will have of what John was like.",
    "Thats\nwhy Im here talking to you  because Ive got a vague foggy hope that I\ncan make you understand.",
    "Understand I mean the sort of person\nJohn was I can see so well what will happen  the headlines in the\npapers  A Doctors Love Life  Gerda myself Veronica Cray.",
    "John\nwasnt like that  he wasnt actually a man who thought much about\nwomen.",
    "It wasnt women who mattered to him most it was his work It\nwas in his work that his interest and his excitement  yes and his sense\nof adventure really lay If John had been taken unawares at any\n\n\fmoment and asked to name the woman who was most in his mind do\nyou know who he would have said  Mrs. Crabtree.",
    "Mrs. Crabtree Poirot was surprised.",
    "Who then is this Mrs.\nCrabtree\n\nThere was something between tears and laughter in Henriettas voice\nas she went on.",
    "Shes an old woman  ugly dirty wrinkled quite indomitable.",
    "John\nthought the world of her.",
    "Shes a patient in St. Christophers Hospital.",
    "Shes got Ridgeways Disease.",
    "Thats a disease thats very rare but if\nyou get it youre bound to die  there just isnt any cure.",
    "But John was\nfinding a cure  I cant explain technically  it was all very complicated some question of hormone secretion.",
    "Hed been making experiments\nand Mrs. Crabtree was his prize patient  you see shes got guts she\nwants to live  and she was fond of John.",
    "She and he were fighting on\nthe same side.",
    "Ridgeways Disease and Mrs. Crabtree is what has\nbeen uppermost in Johns mind for months  night and day  nothing\nelse really counted.",
    "Thats what being the kind of doctor John was\nreally means  not all the Harley Street stuff and the rich fat women\nthat was only a sideline  its the intense scientific curiosity and\nachievement.",
    "I  oh I wish I could make you understand.",
    "Her hands flew out in a curiously despairing gesture and Hercule\nPoirot thought how very lovely and sensitive those hands were.",
    "He said\n\nYou seem to understand very well.",
    "Oh yes I understood.",
    "John used to come and talk do you see Not\nquite to me  partly I think to himself.",
    "He got things clear that way.",
    "Sometimes he was almost despairing  he couldnt see how to\novercome the heightened toxicity  and then hed get an idea for\nvarying the treatment.",
    "I cant explain to you what it was like  it was\nlike yes a battle.",
    "You cant imagine the  the fury of it and the\nconcentration  and yes sometimes the agony.",
    "And sometimes the\nsheer tiredness...\n\nShe was silent for a minute or two her eyes dark with remembrance.",
    "Poirot said curiously\n\nYou must have a certain technical knowledge yourself\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "Not really.",
    "Only enough to understand what John was talking about.",
    "I\ngot books and read about it.",
    "She was silent again her face softened her lips half parted.",
    "She was\nhe thought remembering.",
    "With a sigh her mind came back to the present.",
    "She looked at him\nwistfully.",
    "If I could only make you see \n\nBut you have Mademoiselle.",
    "Really\n\nYes.",
    "One recognizes authenticity when one hears it.",
    "Thank you.",
    "But it wont be so easy to explain to Inspector Grange.",
    "Probably not.",
    "He will concentrate on the personal angle.",
    "Henrietta said vehemently\n\nAnd that was so unimportant  so completely unimportant.",
    "Poirots eyebrows rose slowly.",
    "She answered his unspoken protest.",
    "But it was You see  after a while  I got between John and what he\nwas thinking of.",
    "I affected him as a woman...",
    "He couldnt concentrate\nas he wanted to concentrate  because of me.",
    "He began to be afraid\nthat he was beginning to love me  he didnt want to love anyone.",
    "He he made love to me because he didnt want to think about me too\nmuch.",
    "He wanted it to be light easy just an affair like other affairs that\nhe had had.",
    "And you  Poirot was watching her closely.",
    "You were content to\nhave it  like that\n\nHenrietta got up.",
    "She said and once more it was her dry voice\n\nNo I wasnt content.",
    "After all one is human...\n\n\fPoirot waited a minute then he said\n\nThen why Mademoiselle \n\nWhy she whirled round on him.",
    "I wanted John to be satisfied I\nwanted John to have what he wanted.",
    "I wanted him to be able to go on\nwith the thing he cared about  his work.",
    "If he didnt want to be hurt  to\nbe vulnerable again  why  why then that was all right by me\n\nPoirot rubbed his nose.",
    "Just now Miss Savernake you mentioned Veronica Cray.",
    "Was she\nalso a friend of John Christows\n\nUntil last Saturday night he hadnt seen her for fifteen years.",
    "He knew her fifteen years ago\n\nThey were engaged to be married.",
    "Henrietta came back and sat\ndown.",
    "I see Ive got to make it all clearer.",
    "John loved Veronica\ndesperately.",
    "Veronica was and is a bitch of the first water.",
    "Shes the\nsupreme egoist.",
    "Her terms were that John was to chuck everything he\ncared about and become Miss Veronica Crays little tame husband.",
    "John broke up the whole thing  quite rightly.",
    "But he suffered like hell.",
    "His one idea was to marry someone as unlike Veronica as possible.",
    "He\nmarried Gerda whom you might describe inelegantly as a first class\nchump.",
    "That was all very nice and safe but as anyone could have told\nhim the day came when being married to a chump irritated him.",
    "He\nhad various affairs  none of them important.",
    "Gerda of course never\nknew about them.",
    "But I think myself that for fifteen years there has\n\n\fbeen something wrong with John  something connected with\nVeronica.",
    "He never really got over her.",
    "And then last Saturday he met\nher again  \n\nAfter a long pause Poirot recited dreamily\n\nHe went out with her that night to see her home and returned to The\nHollow at 300 a.m.\n\nHow do you know\n\nA housemaid had the toothache.",
    "Henrietta said irrelevantly Lucy has far too many servants.",
    "But you yourself knew that Mademoiselle.",
    "Yes.",
    "How did you know\n\nAgain there was an infinitesimal pause.",
    "Then Henrietta replied slowly\n\nI was looking out of my window and saw him come back to the\nhouse.",
    "The toothache Mademoiselle\n\nShe smiled at him.",
    "Quite another kind of ache M. Poirot.",
    "She got up and moved towards the door and Poirot said\n\nI will walk back with you Mademoiselle.",
    "They crossed the lane and went through the gate into the chestnut\nplantation.",
    "Henrietta said\n\nWe need not go past the pool.",
    "We can go up to the left and along the\ntop path to the flower walk.",
    "A track led steeply uphill towards the woods.",
    "After a while they came\nto a broader path at right angles across the hillside above the chestnut\ntrees.",
    "Presently they came to a bench and Henrietta sat down Poirot\nbeside her.",
    "The woods were above and behind them and below were\nthe closely planted chestnut groves.",
    "Just in front of the seat a curving\npath led downwards to where just a glimmer of blue water could be\nseen.",
    "Poirot watched Henrietta without speaking.",
    "Her face had relaxed the\ntension had gone.",
    "It looked rounder and younger.",
    "He realized what she\nmust have looked like as a young girl.",
    "He said very gently at last\n\nOf what are you thinking Mademoiselle\n\n\fOf Ainswick...\n\nWhat is Ainswick\n\nAinswick Its a place.",
    "Almost dreamily she described Ainswick to\nhim.",
    "The white graceful house  the big magnolia  growing up it  the\nwhole set in an amphitheatre of wooded hills.",
    "It was your home\n\nNot really.",
    "I lived in Ireland.",
    "It was where we came all of us for\nholidays.",
    "Edward and Midge and myself.",
    "It was Lucys home actually.",
    "It\nbelonged to her father.",
    "After his death it came to Edward.",
    "Not to Sir Henry But it is he who has the title.",
    "Oh thats a K.C.B.",
    "she explained.",
    "Henry was only a distant cousin.",
    "And after Edward Angkatell to whom does it go this Ainswick\n\nHow odd.",
    "Ive never really thought.",
    "If Edward doesnt marry  She\npaused.",
    "A shadow passed over her face.",
    "Hercule Poirot wondered exactly what thought was passing through\nher mind.",
    "I suppose said Henrietta slowly it will go to David.",
    "So thats why \n\nWhy what\n\n\fWhy Lucy asked him here... David and Ainswick\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "They dont fit somehow.",
    "Poirot pointed to the path in front of them.",
    "It is by that path Mademoiselle that you went down to the swimming\npool yesterday\n\nShe gave a quick shiver.",
    "No by the one nearer the house.",
    "It was Edward who came this way.",
    "She turned on him suddenly.",
    "Must we talk about it any more I hate\nthe swimming pool...",
    "I even hate The Hollow.",
    "I hate the dreadful Hollow behind the little wood.",
    "Its lips in the field above are dabbled with bloodred heath\n\nThe redribbd ledges drip with a silent horror of blood\n\nAnd Echo there whatever is askd her answers Death.",
    "Henrietta turned an astonished face on him.",
    "Tennyson said Hercule Poirot nodding his head proudly.",
    "The\npoetry of your Lord Tennyson.",
    "Henrietta was repeating.",
    "And Echo there whatever is askd her... She went on almost to\nherself.",
    "But of course  I see  thats what it is  Echo\n\nHow do you mean Echo\n\nThis place  The Hollow itself I almost saw it before  on Saturday\nwhen Edward and I walked up to the ridge.",
    "An echo of Ainswick... And\nthats what we are we Angkatells.",
    "Echoes Were not real  not real as\nJohn was real.",
    "She turned to Poirot.",
    "I wish you had known him M.\nPoirot.",
    "Were all shadows compared with John.",
    "John was really alive.",
    "I knew that even when he was dying Mademoiselle.",
    "I know.",
    "One felt it... And John is dead and we the echoes are alive...\nIts like you know a very bad joke...",
    "The youth had gone from her face again.",
    "Her lips were twisted bitter\nwith sudden pain.",
    "When Poirot spoke asking a question she did not for a moment take\nin what he was saying.",
    "I am sorry.",
    "What did you say M. Poirot\n\nI was asking whether your aunt Lady Angkatell liked Dr. Christow.",
    "Lucy She is a cousin by the way not an aunt.",
    "Yes she liked him very\nmuch.",
    "And your  also a cousin  Mr. Edward Angkatell  did he like Dr.\nChristow\n\nHer voice was he thought a little constrained as she replied\n\nNot particularly  but then he hardly knew him.",
    "And your  yet another cousin  Mr. David Angkatell\n\nHenrietta smiled.",
    "David I think hates all of us.",
    "He spends his time immured in the library\nreading the Encyclopaedia Britannica.",
    "Ah a serious temperament.",
    "I am sorry for David.",
    "He has had a difficult home life  his mother was\nunbalanced  an invalid.",
    "Now his only way of protecting himself is to try\nto feel superior to everyone.",
    "Its all right as long as it works but now\nand then it breaks down and the vulnerable David peeps through.",
    "Did he feel himself superior to Dr. Christow\n\nHe tried to  but I dont think it came off.",
    "I suspect that Christow was\njust the kind of man that David would like to be  He disliked John in\nconsequence.",
    "Poirot nodded his head thoughtfully.",
    "Yes  selfassurance confidence virility  all the intensive male\nqualities.",
    "It is interesting  very interesting.",
    "Henrietta did not answer.",
    "Through the chestnuts down by the pool Hercule Poirot saw a man\nstooping searching for something or so it seemed.",
    "He murmured I wonder \n\nI beg your pardon\n\nPoirot said That is one of Inspector Granges men.",
    "He seems to be\nlooking for something.",
    "Clues I suppose.",
    "Dont policemen look for clues Cigarette ash\nfootprints burnt matches\n\nHer voice held a kind of bitter mockery.",
    "Poirot answered seriously\n\nYes they look for these things  and sometimes they find them.",
    "But\nthe real clues Miss Savernake in a case like this usually lie in the\npersonal relationships of the people concerned.",
    "I dont think I understand you.",
    "Little things said Poirot his head thrown back his eyes half closed.",
    "Not cigarette ash or a rubber heel mark  but a gesture a look an\nunexpected action...\n\n\fHenrietta turned her head sharply to look at him.",
    "He felt her eyes but\nhe did not turn his head.",
    "She said\n\nAre you thinking of  anything in particular\n\nI was thinking of how you stepped forward and took the revolver out\nof Mrs. Christows hand and then dropped it in the pool.",
    "He felt the slight start she gave.",
    "But her voice was quite normal and\ncalm.",
    "Gerda M. Poirot is rather a clumsy person.",
    "In the shock of the\nmoment and if the revolver had had another cartridge in it she might\nhave fired it and  and hurt someone.",
    "But it was rather clumsy of you was it not to drop it in the pool\n\nWell  I had had a shock too.",
    "She paused.",
    "What are you suggesting\nM. Poirot\n\nPoirot sat up turned his head and spoke in a brisk matteroffact way\n\nIf there were fingerprints on that revolver that is to say fingerprints\nmade before Mrs. Christow handled it it would be interesting to know\nwhose they were  and that we shall never know now.",
    "Henrietta said quietly but steadily\n\nMeaning that you think they were mine... You are suggesting that I\nshot John and then left the revolver beside him so that Gerda could\n\n\fcome along and pick it up and be left holding the baby that is what\nyou are suggesting isnt it But surely if I did that you will give me\ncredit for enough intelligence to have wiped off my own fingerprints\nfirst\n\nBut surely you are intelligent enough to see Mademoiselle that if you\nhad done so and if the revolver had had no fingerprints on it but Mrs.\nChristows that would have been very remarkable For you were all\nshooting with that revolver the day before.",
    "Gerda Christow would\nhardly have wiped the revolver clean of fingerprints before using it why should she\n\nHenrietta said slowly\n\nSo you think I killed John\n\nWhen Dr. Christow was dying he said Henrietta.",
    "And you think that that was an accusation It was not.",
    "What was it then\n\nHenrietta stretched out her foot and traced a pattern with the toe.",
    "She\nsaid in a low voice\n\nArent you forgetting  what I told you not very long ago I mean  the\nterms we were on\n\nAh yes  he was your lover  and so as he is dying he says Henrietta.",
    "That is very touching.",
    "She turned blazing eyes upon him.",
    "Must you sneer\n\nI am not sneering But I do not like being lied to  and that I think is\nwhat you are trying to do.",
    "Henrietta said quietly\n\nI have told you that I am not very truthful  but when John said\nHenrietta he was not accusing me of having murdered him.",
    "Cant you\nunderstand that people of my kind who make things are quite\nincapable of taking life I dont kill people M. Poirot.",
    "I couldnt kill\nanyone.",
    "Thats the plain stark truth.",
    "You suspect me simply because\nmy name was murmured by a dying man who hardly knew what he was\nsaying.",
    "Dr. Christow knew perfectly what he was saying.",
    "His voice was as\nalive and conscious as that of a doctor doing a vital operation who\nsays sharply and urgently Nurse the forceps please.",
    "But  She seemed at a loss taken aback.",
    "Hercule Poirot went on\nrapidly\n\nAnd it is not just on account of what Dr. Christow said when he was\ndying.",
    "I do not believe for one moment that you are capable of\npremeditated murder  that no.",
    "But you might have fired that shot in a\nsudden moment of fierce resentment  and if so  if so Mademoiselle\nyou have the creative imagination and ability to cover your tracks.",
    "Henrietta got up.",
    "She stood for a moment pale and shaken looking at\nhim.",
    "She said with a sudden rueful smile\n\nAnd I thought you liked me.",
    "Hercule Poirot sighed.",
    "He said sadly\n\nThat is what is so unfortunate for me.",
    "I do.",
    "Chapter 19\n\nWhen Henrietta had left him Poirot sat on until he saw below him\nInspector Grange walk past the pool with a resolute easy stride and\ntake the path on past the pavilion.",
    "The Inspector was walking in a purposeful way.",
    "He must be going therefore either to Resthaven or to Dovecotes.",
    "Poirot wondered which.",
    "He got up and retraced his steps along the way he had come.",
    "If\nInspector Grange was coming to see him he was interested to hear\nwhat the Inspector had to say.",
    "But when he got back to Resthaven there was no sign of a visitor.",
    "Poirot looked thoughtfully up the lane in the direction of Dovecotes.",
    "Veronica Cray had not he knew gone back to London.",
    "He found his curiosity rising about Veronica Cray.",

    "It was he thought an interesting pattern...",
    "Yes that was how he saw\nit a pattern.",
    "A design of intermingled emotions and the clash of personalities.",
    "A\nstrange involved design with dark threads of hate and desire running\nthrough it.",
    "Had Gerda Christow shot her husband Or was it not quite so simple\nas that\n\nHe thought of his conversation with Henrietta and decided that it was\nnot so simple.",
    "Henrietta had jumped to the conclusion that he suspected her of the\nmurder but actually he had not gone nearly as far as that in his mind.",
    "No further indeed than the belief that Henrietta knew something.",
    "Knew\nsomething or was concealing something  which\n\nHe shook his head dissatisfied.",
    "The scene by the pool.",
    "A set scene.",
    "A stage scene.",
    "Staged by whom\n\n\fStaged for whom\n\nThe answer to the second question was he strongly suspected\nHercule Poirot.",
    "He had thought so at the time.",
    "But he had thought then\nthat it was an impertinence  a joke.",
    "It was still an impertinence  but not a joke.",
    "And the answer to the first question\n\nHe shook his head.",
    "He did not know.",
    "He had not the least idea.",

    "And somewhere in that interplay of characters and emotions lay the\ntruth...\n\n\fTo Hercule Poirot there was only one thing more fascinating than the\nstudy of human beings and that was the pursuit of truth...",
    "He meant to know the truth of John Christows death.",
    "But of course Inspector said Veronica.",
    "Im only too anxious to\nhelp you.",
    "Thank you Miss Cray.",
    "Veronica Cray was not somehow at all what the Inspector had\nimagined.",
    "He had been prepared for glamour for artificiality even possibly for\nheroics.",
    "He would not have been at all surprised if she had put on an\nact of some kind.",
    "In fact she was he shrewdly suspected putting on an act.",
    "But it was\nnot the kind of act he had expected.",
    "There was no overdone feminine charm  glamour was not stressed.",
    "Instead he felt that he was sitting opposite to an exceedingly goodlooking and expensively dressed woman who was also a good\nbusiness woman.",
    "Veronica Cray he thought was no fool.",
    "We just want a clear statement Miss Cray.",
    "You came over to The\nHollow on Saturday evening\n\n\fYes Id run out of matches.",
    "One forgets how important these things\nare in the country.",
    "You went all the way to The Hollow Why not to your next door\nneighbour M. Poirot\n\nShe smiled  a superb confident camera smile.",
    "I didnt know who my next door neighbour was  otherwise I should\nhave.",
    "I just thought he was some little foreigner and I thought you\nknow he might become a bore  living so near.",
    "Yes thought Grange quite plausible.",
    "Shed worked that one out ready\nfor the occasion.",
    "You got your matches he said.",
    "And you recognized an old friend in\nDr. Christow I understand\n\nShe nodded.",
    "Poor John.",
    "Yes I hadnt seen him for fifteen years.",
    "Really There was polite disbelief in the Inspectors tone.",
    "Really.",
    "Her tone was firmly assertive.",
    "You were pleased to see him\n\n\fVery pleased.",
    "Its always delightful dont you think Inspector to\ncome across an old friend\n\nIt can be on some occasions.",
    "Veronica Cray went on without waiting for further questioning\n\nJohn saw me home.",
    "Youll want to know if he said anything that could\nhave a bearing on the tragedy and Ive been thinking over our\nconversation very carefully  but really there wasnt a pointer of any\nkind.",
    "What did you talk about Miss Cray\n\nOld days.",
    "Do you remember this that and the other\n\nShe smiled pensively.",
    "We had known each other in the South of\nFrance.",
    "John had really changed very little  older of course and more\nassured.",
    "I gather he was quite well known in his profession.",
    "He didnt\ntalk about his personal life at all.",
    "I just got the impression that his\nmarried life wasnt perhaps frightfully happy  but it was only the\nvaguest impression.",
    "I suppose his wife poor thing was one of those\ndim jealous women  probably always making a fuss about his betterlooking lady patients.",
    "No said Grange.",
    "She doesnt really seem to have been that way.",
    "Veronica said quickly\n\n\fYou mean  it was all underneath Yes  yes I can see that that would\nbe far more dangerous.",
    "I see you think Mrs. Christow shot him Miss Cray\n\nI oughtnt to have said that One mustnt comment  is that it  before a\ntrial Im extremely sorry Inspector.",
    "It was just that my maid told me\nshed been found actually standing over the body with the revolver still\nin her hand.",
    "You know how in these quiet country places everything\ngets so exaggerated and servants do pass things on.",
    "Servants can be very useful sometimes Miss Cray.",
    "Yes I suppose you get a lot of your information that way.",
    "Grange went on stolidly\n\nIts a question of course of who had a motive.",
    "He paused.",
    "Veronica said with a faint rueful smile\n\nAnd a wife is always the first suspect How cynical But theres\nusually whats called the other woman.",
    "I suppose she might be\nconsidered to have a motive too\n\nYou think there was another woman in Dr. Christows life\n\nWell  yes I did rather imagine there might be.",
    "One just gets an\nimpression you know.",
    "Impressions can be very helpful sometimes said Grange.",
    "I rather imagined  from what he said  that that sculptress woman\nwas well a very close friend.",
    "But I expect you know all about that\nalready\n\nWe have to look into all these things of course.",
    "Inspector Granges voice was strictly noncommittal but he saw\nwithout appearing to see a quick spiteful flash of satisfaction in those\nlarge blue eyes.",
    "He said making the question very official\n\nDr. Christow saw you home you say.",
    "What time was it when you said\ngood night to him\n\nDo you know I really cant remember We talked for some time I do\nknow that.",
    "It must have been quite late.",
    "He came in\n\nYes I gave him a drink.",
    "I see.",
    "I imagined your conversation might have taken place in the  er pavilion by the swimming pool.",
    "He saw her eyelids flicker.",
    "There was hardly a moments hesitation\nbefore she said\n\n\fYou really are a detective arent you Yes we sat there and smoked\nand talked for some time.",
    "How did you know\n\nHer face bore the pleased eager expression of a child asking to be\nshown a clever trick.",
    "You left your furs behind there Miss Cray.",
    "He added just without\nemphasis And the matches.",
    "Yes of course I did.",
    "Dr. Christow returned to The Hollow at 300 a.m. announced the\nInspector again without emphasis.",
    "Was it really as late as that Veronica sounded quite amazed.",
    "Yes it was Miss Cray.",
    "Of course we had so much to talk over  not having seen each other\nfor so many years.",
    "Are you sure it was quite so long since you had seen Dr. Christow\n\nIve just told you I hadnt seen him for fifteen years.",
    "Are you quite sure youre not making a mistake Ive got the\nimpression you might have been seeing quite a lot of him.",
    "What on earth makes you think that\n\n\fWell this note for one thing.",
    "Inspector Grange took out a letter from\nhis pocket glanced down at it cleared his throat and read\n\nPlease come over this morning.",
    "I must see you.",
    "Veronica.",
    "Yees.",
    "She smiled.",
    "It is a little peremptory perhaps.",
    "Im afraid\nHollywood makes one  well rather arrogant.",
    "Dr. Christow came over to your house the following morning in\nanswer to that summons.",
    "You had a quarrel.",
    "Would you care to tell me\nMiss Cray what that quarrel was about\n\nThe Inspector had unmasked his batteries.",
    "He was quick to seize the\nflash of anger the illtempered tightening of the lips.",
    "She snapped out\n\nWe didnt quarrel.",
    "Oh yes you did Miss Cray.",
    "Your last words were I think I hate you\nmore than I believed I could hate anyone.",
    "She was silent now.",
    "He could feel her thinking  thinking quickly and\nwarily.",
    "Some women might have rushed into speech.",
    "But Veronica\nCray was too clever for that.",
    "She shrugged her shoulders and said lightly\n\n\fI see.",
    "More servants tales.",
    "My little maid has rather a lively\nimagination.",
    "There are different ways of saying things you know.",
    "I can\nassure you that I wasnt being melodramatic.",
    "It was really a mildly\nflirtatious remark.",
    "We had been sparring together.",
    "Those words were not intended to be taken seriously\n\nCertainly not.",
    "And I can assure you Inspector that it was fifteen\nyears since I had last seen John Christow.",
    "You can verify that for\nyourself.",
    "She was poised again detached sure of herself.",
    "Grange did not argue or pursue the subject.",
    "He got up.",
    "Thats all for the moment Miss Cray he said pleasantly.",
    "He went out of Dovecotes and down the lane and turned in at the gate\nof Resthaven.",
    "Hercule Poirot stared at the Inspector in the utmost surprise.",
    "He\nrepeated incredulously\n\nThe revolver that Gerda Christow was holding and which was\nsubsequently dropped into the pool was not the revolver that fired the\nfatal shot But that is extraordinary.",
    "Exactly M. Poirot.",
    "Put bluntly it just doesnt make sense.",
    "Poirot murmured softly\n\nNo it does not make sense...",
    "But all the same Inspector it has got to\nmake sense eh\n\nThe Inspector said heavily Thats just it M. Poirot.",
    "Weve got to find\nsome way that it does make sense  but at the moment I cant see it.",
    "The truth is that we shant get much further until weve found the gun\nthat was used.",
    "It came from Sir Henrys collection all right  at least\ntheres one missing  and that means that the whole thing is still tied up\nwith The Hollow.",
    "Yes murmured Poirot.",
    "It is still tied up with The Hollow.",
    "It seemed a simple straightforward business went on the Inspector.",
    "Well it isnt so simple or so straightforward.",
    "No said Poirot it is not simple.",
    "Weve got to admit the possibility that the thing was a frameup  thats\nto say that it was all set to implicate Gerda Christow.",
    "But if that was so\nwhy not leave the right revolver lying by the body for her to pick up\n\nShe might not have picked it up.",
    "Thats true but even if she didnt so long as nobody elses\nfingerprints were on the gun  thats to say if it was wiped after use she would probably have been suspected all right.",
    "And thats what the\nmurderer wanted wasnt it\n\n\fWas it\n\nGrange stared.",
    "Well if youd done a murder youd want to plant it good and quick on\nsomeone else wouldnt you That would be a murderers normal\nreaction.",
    "Yees said Poirot.",
    "But then perhaps we have here a rather unusual\ntype of murderer.",
    "It is possible that that is the solution of our problem.",
    "What is the solution\n\nPoirot said thoughtfully\n\nAn unusual type of murderer.",
    "Inspector Grange stared at him curiously.",
    "He said\n\nBut then  what was the murderers idea What was he or she getting\nat\n\nPoirot spread out his hands with a sigh.",
    "I have no idea  I have no idea\nat all.",
    "But it seems to me  dimly \n\nYes\n\nThat the murderer is someone who wanted to kill John Christow but\nwho did not want to implicate Gerda Christow.",
    "Hm Actually we suspected her right away.",
    "Ah yes but it was only a matter of time before the facts about the gun\ncame to light and that was bound to give a new angle.",
    "In the interval\nthe murderer has had time \n\nPoirot came to a full stop.",
    "Time to do what\n\nAh mon ami there you have me.",
    "Again I have to say I do not know.",
    "Inspector Grange took a turn or two up and down the room.",
    "Then he\nstopped and came to a stand in front of Poirot.",
    "Ive come to you this afternoon M. Poirot for two reasons.",
    "One is\nbecause I know  its pretty well known in the Force  that youre a man\nof wide experience whos done some very tricky work on this type of\nproblem.",
    "Thats reason Number One.",
    "But theres another reason.",
    "You\nwere there.",
    "You were an eyewitness.",
    "You saw what happened.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Yes I saw what happened  but the eyes Inspector Grange are very\nunreliable witnesses.",
    "What do you mean M. Poirot\n\nThe eyes see sometimes what they are meant to see.",
    "You think that it was planned out beforehand\n\nI suspect it.",
    "It was exactly you understand like a stage scene.",
    "What I\nsaw was clear enough.",
    "A man who had just been shot and the woman\nwho had shot him holding in her hand the gun she had just used.",
    "That\nis what I saw and already we know that in one particular the picture is\nwrong.",
    "That gun had not been used to shoot John Christow.",
    "Hm the Inspector pulled his drooping moustache firmly downwards.",
    "What you are getting at is that some of the other particulars of the\npicture may be wrong too\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said\n\nThere were three other people present  three people who had\napparently just arrived on the scene.",
    "But that may not be true either.",
    "The pool is surrounded by a thick grove of young chestnuts.",
    "From the\npool five paths lead away one to the house one up to the woods one\nup to the flower walk one down from the pool to the farm and one to\nthe lane here.",
    "Of those three people each one came along a different path Edward\nAngkatell from the woods above Lady Angkatell up from the farm and\nHenrietta Savernake from the flower border above the house.",
    "Those\nthree arrived upon the scene of the crime almost simultaneously and a\nfew minutes after Gerda Christow.",
    "But one of those three Inspector could have been at the pool before\nGerda Christow could have shot John Christow and could have\n\n\fretreated up or down one of the paths and then turning round could\nhave arrived at the same time as the others.",
    "Inspector Grange said\n\nYes its possible.",
    "And another possibility not envisaged at the time someone could\nhave come along the path from the lane could have shot John\nChristow and could have gone back the same way unseen.",
    "Grange said Youre dead right.",
    "There are two other possible\nsuspects besides Gerda Christow.",
    "Weve got the same motive jealousy  its definitely a crime passionel  there were two other\nwomen mixed up with John Christow.",
    "He paused and said\n\nChristow went over to see Veronica Cray that morning.",
    "They had a\nrow.",
    "She told him that shed make him sorry for what hed done and\nshe said she hated him more than she believed she could hate\nanyone.",
    "Interesting murmured Poirot.",
    "Shes straight from Hollywood  and by what I read in the papers they\ndo a bit of shooting each other out there sometimes.",
    "She could have\ncome along to get her furs which shed left in the pavilion the night\nbefore.",
    "They could have met  the whole thing could have flared up \n\n\fshe fired at him  and then hearing someone coming she could have\ndodged back the way she came.",
    "He paused a moment and added irritably\n\nAnd now we come to the part where it all goes haywire.",
    "That damned\ngun Unless his eyes brightened she shot him with her own gun and\ndropped one that shed pinched from Sir Henrys study so as to throw\nsuspicion on the crowd at The Hollow.",
    "She mightnt know about our\nbeing able to identify the gun used from the marks on the rifling.",
    "How many people do know that I wonder\n\nI put the point to Sir Henry.",
    "He said he thought quite a lot of people\nwould know  on account of all the detective stories that are written.",
    "Quoted a new one The Clue of the Dripping Fountain which he said\nJohn Christow himself had been reading on Saturday and which\nemphasized that particular point.",
    "But Veronica Cray would have had to get the gun somehow from Sir\nHenrys study.",
    "Yes it would mean premeditation...",
    "The Inspector took another tug\nat his moustache then he looked at Poirot.",
    "But youve hinted yourself at another possibility M. Poirot.",
    "Theres\nMiss Savernake.",
    "And heres where your eyewitness stuff or rather I\nshould say earwitness stuff comes in again.",
    "Dr. Christow said\nHenrietta when he was dying.",
    "You heard him  they all heard him\nthough Mr. Angkatell doesnt seem to have caught what he said \n\n\fEdward Angkatell did not hear That is interesting.",
    "But the others did.",
    "Miss Savernake herself says he tried to speak to\nher.",
    "Lady Angkatell says he opened his eyes saw Miss Savernake and\nsaid Henrietta.",
    "She doesnt I think attach any importance to it.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "No  she would not attach importance to it.",
    "Now M. Poirot what about you You were there  you saw  you\nheard.",
    "Was Or.",
    "Christow trying to tell you all that it was Henrietta who\nhad shot him In short was that word an accusation\n\nPoirot said slowly\n\nI did not think so at the time.",
    "But now M. Poirot What do you think now\n\nPoirot sighed.",
    "Then he said slowly\n\nIt may have been so.",
    "I cannot say more than that.",
    "It is an impression\nonly for which you are asking me and when the moment is past there\nis a temptation to read into things a meaning which was not there at\nthe time.",
    "Grange said hastily Of course this is an off the record.",
    "What M.\nPoirot thought isnt evidence  I know that.",
    "Its only a pointer Im trying\nto get.",
    "Oh I understand you very well  and an impression from an eyewitness can be a very useful thing.",
    "But I am humiliated to have to say\nthat my impressions are valueless.",
    "I was under the misconception\ninduced by the visual evidence that Mrs. Christow had just shot her\nhusband so that when Dr. Christow opened his eyes and said\nHenrietta I never thought of it as being an accusation.",
    "It is tempting\nnow looking back to read into that scene something that was not\nthere.",
    "I know what you mean said Grange.",
    "But it seems to me that since\nHenrietta was the last word Christow spoke it must have meant one\nof two things.",
    "It was either an accusation of murder or else it was well purely emotional.",
    "Shes the woman he was in love with and he\nwas dying.",
    "Now bearing everything in mind which of the two did it\nsound like to you\n\nPoirot sighed stirred closed his eyes opened them again stretched\nout his hands in acute vexation.",
    "He said\n\nHis voice was urgent  that is all I can say  urgent.",
    "It seemed to me\nneither accusing nor emotional  but urgent yes And of one thing I am\nsure.",
    "He was in full possession of his faculties.",
    "He spoke  yes he\nspoke like a doctor  a doctor who has say a sudden surgical\nemergency on his hands  a patient who is bleeding to death\nperhaps...\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "That is the best I can do for you.",
    "Medical eh said the Inspector.",
    "Well yes that is a third way of\nlooking at it.",
    "He was shot he suspected he was dying he wanted\n\n\fsomething done for him quickly.",
    "And if as Lady Angkatell says Miss\nSavernake was the first person he saw when his eyes opened then he\nwould appeal to her... Its not very satisfactory though.",
    "Nothing about this case is satisfactory said Poirot with some\nbitterness.",
    "A murder scene set and staged to deceive Hercule Poirot  and which\nhad deceived him No it was not satisfactory.",
    "Inspector Grange was looking out of the window.",
    "Hullo he said.",
    "heres Coombes my Sergeant.",
    "Looks as though hes\ngot something.",
    "Hes been working on the servants  the friendly touch.",
    "Hes a nicelooking chap got a way with women.",
    "Sergeant Coombes came in a little breathlessly.",
    "He was clearly\npleased with himself though subduing the fact under a respectful\nofficial manner.",
    "Thought Id better come and report sir since I knew where youd\ngone.",
    "He hesitated shooting a doubtful glance at Poirot whose exotic\nforeign appearance did not commend itself to his sense of official\nreticence.",
    "Out with it my lad said Grange.",
    "Never mind M. Poirot here.",
    "Hes\nforgotten more about this game than youll know for many years to\ncome.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Its this way sir.",
    "I got something out of the kitchen maid \n\nGrange interrupted.",
    "He turned to Poirot triumphantly.",
    "What did I tell you Theres always hope where theres a kitchen\nmaid.",
    "Heaven help us when domestic staffs are so reduced that\nnobody keeps a kitchen maid any more.",
    "Kitchen maids talk kitchen\nmaids babble.",
    "Theyre so kept down and in their place by the cook and\nthe upper servants that its only human nature to talk about what they\nknow to someone who wants to hear it.",
    "Go on Coombes.",
    "This is what the girl says sir.",
    "That on Sunday afternoon she saw\nGudgeon the butler walking across the hall with a revolver in his\nhand.",
    "Gudgeon\n\nYes sir.",
    "Coombes referred to a notebook.",
    "These are her own\nwords.",
    "I dont know what to do but I think I ought to say what I saw\nthat day.",
    "I saw Mr. Gudgeon he was standing in the hall with a revolver\nin his hand.",
    "Mr. Gudgeon looked very peculiar indeed.",
    "I dont suppose said Coombes breaking off that the part about\nlooking peculiar means anything.",
    "She probably put that in out of her\nhead.",
    "But I thought you ought to know about it at once sir.",
    "Inspector Grange rose with the satisfaction of a man who sees a task\nahead of him which he is well fitted to perform.",
    "Gudgeon he said.",
    "Ill have a word with Mr. Gudgeon right away.",
    "Chapter 20\n\nSitting once more in Sir Henrys study Inspector Grange stared at the\nimpassive face of the man in front of him.",
    "So far the honours lay with Gudgeon.",
    "I am very sorry sir he repeated.",
    "I suppose I ought to have\nmentioned the occurrence but it had slipped my memory.",
    "He looked apologetically from the Inspector to Sir Henry.",
    "It was about 530 if I remember rightly sir.",
    "I was crossing the hall to\nsee if there were any letters for the post when I noticed a revolver\nlying on the hall table.",
    "I presumed it was from the masters collection\nso I picked it up and brought it in here.",
    "There was a gap on the shelf by\nthe mantelpiece where it had come from so I replaced it where it\nbelonged.",
    "Point it out to me said Grange.",
    "Gudgeon rose and went to the shelf in question the Inspector close\nbeside him...",
    "It was this one sir.",
    "Gudgeons finger indicated a small Mauser pistol\nat the end of the row.",
    "It was a .25  quite a small weapon.",
    "It was certainly not the gun that\nhad killed John Christow.",
    "Grange with his eyes on Gudgeons face said\n\nThats an automatic pistol not a revolver.",
    "Gudgeon coughed.",
    "Indeed sir Im afraid that I am not at all well up in firearms.",
    "I may\nhave used the term revolver rather loosely sir.",
    "But you are quite sure that that is the gun you found in the hall and\nbrought in here\n\nOh yes sir there can be no possible doubt about that.",
    "Grange stopped him as he was about to stretch out a hand.",
    "Dont touch it please.",
    "I must examine it for fingerprints and to see if it\nis loaded.",
    "I dont think it is loaded sir.",
    "None of Sir Henrys collection is kept\nloaded.",
    "And as for fingerprints I polished it over with my handkerchief\nbefore replacing it sir so there will only be my fingerprints on it.",
    "Why did you do that asked Grange sharply.",
    "But Gudgeons apologetic smile did not waver.",
    "I fancied it might be dusty sir.",
    "The door opened and Lady Angkatell came in.",
    "She smiled at the\nInspector.",
    "How nice to see you Inspector Grange.",
    "What is all this about a\nrevolver and Gudgeon That child in the kitchen is in floods of tears.",
    "Mrs. Medway has been bullying her  but of course the girl was quite\nright to say what she saw if she thought she ought to do so.",
    "I always\nfind right and wrong so bewildering myself  easy you know if right is\nunpleasant and wrong is agreeable because then one knows where\none is  but confusing when it is the other way about  and I think dont\nyou Inspector that everyone must do what they think right\nthemselves.",
    "What have you been telling them about that pistol\nGudgeon\n\nGudgeon said with respectful emphasis\n\nThe pistol was in the hall m lady on the centre table.",
    "I have no idea\nwhere it came from.",
    "I brought it in here and put it away in its proper\nplace.",
    "That is what I have just told the Inspector and he quite\nunderstands.",
    "Lady Angkatell shook her head.",
    "She said gently\n\nYou really shouldnt have said that Gudgeon.",
    "Ill talk to the Inspector\nmyself.",
    "Gudgeon made a slight movement and Lady Angkatell said very\ncharmingly\n\nI do appreciate your motives Gudgeon.",
    "I know how you always try to\nsave us trouble and annoyance.",
    "She added in gentle dismissal That\nwill be all now.",
    "Gudgeon hesitated threw a fleeting glance towards Sir Henry and\nthen at the Inspector then bowed and moved towards the door.",
    "Grange made a motion as though to stop him but for some reason he\nwas not able to define to himself he let his arm fall again.",
    "Gudgeon\nwent out and closed the door.",
    "Lady Angkatell dropped into a chair and smiled at the two men.",
    "She\nsaid conversationally\n\nYou know I really do think that was very charming of Gudgeon.",
    "Quite\nfeudal if you know what I mean.",
    "Yes feudal is the right word.",
    "Grange said stiffly\n\nAm I to understand Lady Angkatell that you yourself have some\nfurther knowledge about the matter\n\nOf course.",
    "Gudgeon didnt find it in the hall at all.",
    "He found it when he\ntook the eggs out.",
    "The eggs Inspector Grange stared at her.",
    "Out of the basket said Lady Angkatell.",
    "She seemed to think that everything was now quite clear.",
    "Sir Henry said gently\n\nYou must tell us a little more my dear.",
    "Inspector Grange and I are still\nat sea.",
    "Oh Lady Angkatell set herself to be explicit.",
    "The pistol you see was\nin the basket under the eggs.",
    "What basket and what eggs Lady Angkatell\n\nThe basket I took down to the farm.",
    "The pistol was in it and then I put\nthe eggs in on top of the pistol and forgot all about it.",
    "And when we\nfound poor John Christow dead by the pool it was such a shock I let\ngo of the basket and Gudgeon just caught it in time because of the\neggs I mean.",
    "If Id dropped it they would have been broken and he\nbrought it back to the house.",
    "And later I asked him about writing the\ndate on the eggs  a thing I always do  otherwise one eats the fresher\neggs sometimes before the older ones  and he said all that had been\nattended to  and now that I remember he was rather emphatic about\nit.",
    "And that is what I mean by being feudal.",
    "He found the pistol and put\nit back in here  I suppose really because there were police in the\nhouse.",
    "Servants are always so worried by police I find.",
    "Very nice and\nloyal  but also quite stupid because of course Inspector its the\ntruth you want to hear isnt it\n\n\fAnd Lady Angkatell finished up by giving the Inspector a beaming\nsmile.",
    "The truth is what I mean to get said Grange rather grimly.",
    "Lady Angkatell sighed.",
    "It all seems such a fuss doesnt it she said.",
    "I mean all this\nhounding people down.",
    "I dont suppose whoever it was that shot John\nChristow really meant to shoot him  not seriously I mean.",
    "If it was\nGerda Im sure she didnt.",
    "In fact Im really surprised that she didnt\nmiss  its the sort of thing that one would expect of Gerda.",
    "And shes\nreally a very nice kind creature.",
    "And if you go and put her in prison\nand hang her what on earth is going to happen to the children If she\ndid shoot John shes probably dreadfully sorry about it now.",
    "Its bad\nenough for children to have a father whos been murdered  but it will\nmake it infinitely worse for them to have their mother hanged for it.",
    "Sometimes I dont think you policemen think of these things.",
    "We are not contemplating arresting anyone at present Lady\nAngkatell.",
    "Well thats sensible at any rate.",
    "But I have thought all along\nInspector Grange that you were a very sensible sort of man.",
    "Again that charming almost dazzling smile.",
    "Inspector Grange blinked a little.",
    "He could not help it but he came\nfirmly to the point at issue.",
    "As you said just now Lady Angkatell its the truth I want to get at.",
    "You\ntook the pistol from here  which gun was it by the way\n\nLady Angkatell nodded her head towards the shelf by the mantelpiece.",
    "The second from the end.",
    "The Mauser .25.",
    "Something in the crisp\ntechnical way she spoke jarred on Grange.",
    "He had not somehow\nexpected Lady Angkatell whom up to now he had labelled in his own\nmind as vague and just a bit batty to describe a firearm with such\ntechnical precision.",
    "You took the pistol from here and put it in your basket.",
    "Why\n\nI knew youd ask me that said Lady Angkatell.",
    "Her tone\nunexpectedly was almost triumphant.",
    "And of course there must be\nsome reason.",
    "Dont you think so Henry She turned to her husband.",
    "Dont you think I must have had a reason for taking a pistol out that\nmorning\n\nI should certainly have thought so my dear said Sir Henry stiffly.",
    "One does things said Lady Angkatell gazing thoughtfully in front of\nher and then one doesnt remember why one has done them.",
    "But I\nthink you know Inspector that there always is a reason if one can\nonly get at it.",
    "I must have had some idea in my head when I put the\nMauser into my egg basket.",
    "She appealed to him.",
    "What do you think\nit can have been\n\nGrange stared at her.",
    "She displayed no embarrassment  just a\nchildlike eagerness.",
    "It beat him.",
    "He had never yet met anyone like Lucy\nAngkatell and just for the moment he didnt know what to do about it.",
    "My wife said Sir Henry is extremely absentminded Inspector.",
    "So it seems sir said Grange.",
    "He did not say it very nicely.",
    "Why do you think I took that pistol Lady Angkatell asked him\nconfidentially.",
    "I have no idea Lady Angkatell.",
    "I came in here mused Lady Angkatell.",
    "I had been talking to\nSimmons about the pillow cases  and I dimly remember crossing over\nto the fireplace  and thinking we must get a new poker  the curate\nnot the rector \n\nInspector Grange stared.",
    "He felt his head going round.",
    "And I remember picking up the Mauser  it was a nice handy little gun\nIve always liked it  and dropping it into the basket  Id just got the\nbasket from the flower room  But there were so many things in my\nhead  Simmons you know and the bindweed in the Michaelmas\ndaisies  and hoping Mrs. Medway would make a really rich Nigger in\nhis Shirt \n\nA nigger in his shirt Inspector Grange had to break in.",
    "Chocolate you know and eggs  and then covered with whipped\ncream.",
    "Just the sort of sweet a foreigner would like for lunch.",
    "Inspector Grange spoke fiercely and brusquely feeling like a man who\nbrushes away fine spiders webs which are impairing his vision.",
    "Did you load the pistol\n\nHe had hoped to startle her  perhaps even to frighten her a little but\nLady Angkatell only considered the question with a kind of desperate\nthoughtfulness.",
    "Now did I Thats so stupid.",
    "I cant remember.",
    "But I should think I\nmust have dont you Inspector I mean whats the good of a pistol\nwithout ammunition I wish I could remember exactly what was in my\nhead at the time.",
    "My dear Lucy said Sir Henry.",
    "What goes on or does not go on in\nyour head has been for years the despair of everyone who knows you\nwell.",
    "She flashed him a very sweet smile.",
    "I am trying to remember Henry dear.",
    "One does such curious things.",
    "I\npicked up the telephone receiver the other morning and found myself\nlooking down at it quite bewildered.",
    "I couldnt imagine what I wanted\nwith it.",
    "Presumably you were going to ring someone up said the Inspector\ncoldly.",
    "No funnily enough I wasnt.",
    "I remembered afterwards  Id been\nwondering why Mrs. Mears the gardeners wife held her baby in such\n\n\fan odd way and I picked up the telephone receiver to try you know\njust how one would hold a baby and of course I realized that it had\nlooked odd because Mrs. Mears was lefthanded and had its head the\nother way round.",
    "She looked triumphantly from one to the other of the two men.",
    "Well thought the Inspector I suppose its possible that there are\npeople like this...",
    "But he did not feel very sure about it.",
    "The whole thing he realized might be a tissue of lies.",
    "The kitchen\nmaid for instance had distinctly stated that it was a revolver Gudgeon\nhad been holding.",
    "Still you couldnt set much store by that.",
    "The girl\nknew nothing of firearms.",
    "She had heard a revolver talked about in\nconnection with the crime and revolver or pistol would be all one to\nher.",
    "Both Gudgeon and Lady Angkatell had specified the Mauser pistol  but\nthere was nothing to prove their statements.",
    "It might actually have\nbeen the missing revolver that Gudgeon had been handling and he\nmight have returned it not to the study but to Lady Angkatell herself.",
    "The servants all seemed absolutely besotted about the damned\nwoman.",
    "Supposing it was actually she who had shot John Christow But why\nshould she He couldnt see why.",
    "Would they still back her up and tell lies for her He had an\nuncomfortable feeling that that was just what they would do.",
    "And now this fantastic story of hers about not being able to remember\n surely she could think up something better than that.",
    "And looking so\nnatural about it  not in the least embarrassed or apprehensive.",
    "Damn\nit all she gave you the impression that she was speaking the literal\ntruth.",
    "He got up.",
    "When you remember a little more perhaps youll tell me Lady\nAngkatell he said dryly.",
    "She answered Of course I will Inspector.",
    "Things come to one quite\nsuddenly sometimes.",
    "Grange went out of the study.",
    "In the hall he put a finger round the\ninside of a collar and drew a deep breath.",
    "He felt all tangled up in thistledown.",
    "What he needed was his oldest\nand foulest pipe a pint of ale and a good steak and chips.",
    "Something\nplain and objective.",
    "Chapter 21\n\n\fIn the study Lady Angkatell flittered about touching things here and\nthere with a vague forefinger.",
    "Sir Henry sat back in his chair watching\nher.",
    "He said at last\n\nWhy did you take the pistol Lucy\n\nLady Angkatell came back and sank down gracefully into a chair.",
    "Im not really quite sure Henry.",
    "I suppose I had some vague ideas of\nan accident.",
    "Accident\n\nYes.",
    "All those roots of trees you know said Lady Angkatell vaguely\nsticking out  so easy just to trip over one... One might have had a few\nshots at the target and left one shot in the magazine  careless of\ncourse  but then people are careless.",
    "Ive always thought you know\nthat accident would be the simplest way to do a thing of that kind.",
    "One\nwould be dreadfully sorry of course and blame oneself...",
    "Her voice died away.",
    "Her husband sat very still without taking his eyes\noff her face.",
    "He spoke again in the same quiet careful voice\n\nWho was to have had  the accident\n\nLucy turned her head a little looking at him in surprise.",
    "John Christow of course.",
    "Good God Lucy  He broke off.",
    "She said earnestly\n\nOh Henry Ive been so dreadfully worried.",
    "About Ainswick.",
    "I see.",
    "Its Ainswick.",
    "Youve always cared too much about Ainswick\nLucy.",
    "Sometimes I think its the only thing you do care for...\n\nEdward and David are the last  the last of the Angkatells.",
    "And David\nwont do Henry.",
    "Hell never marry  because of his mother and all that.",
    "Hell get the place when Edward dies and he wont marry and you and\nI will be dead long before hes even middleaged.",
    "Hell be the last of the\nAngkatells and the whole thing will die out.",
    "Does it matter so much Lucy\n\nOf course it matters Ainswick\n\nYou should have been a boy Lucy.",
    "But he smiled a little  for he could not imagine Lucy being anything but\nfeminine.",
    "It all depends on Edwards marrying  and Edwards so obstinate  that\nlong head of his like my fathers.",
    "I hoped hed get over Henrietta and\nmarry some nice girl  but I see now that thats hopeless.",
    "Then I\nthought that Henriettas affair with John would run the usual course.",
    "Johns affairs were never I imagined very permanent.",
    "But I saw him\nlooking at her the other evening.",
    "He really cared about her.",
    "If only\nJohn were out of the way I felt that Henrietta would marry Edward.",
    "Shes not the kind of person to cherish a memory and live in the past.",
    "So you see it all came to that  get rid of John Christow.",
    "Lucy.",
    "You didnt  What did you do Lucy\n\nLady Angkatell got up again.",
    "She took two dead flowers out of a vase.",
    "Darling she said you dont imagine for a moment do you that I\nshot John Christow I did have that silly idea about an accident.",
    "But\nthen you know I remembered that wed asked John Christow here its not as though he proposed himself.",
    "One cant ask someone to be a\nguest and then arrange accidents.",
    "Even Arabs are most particular\nabout hospitality.",
    "So dont worry will you Henry\n\nShe stood looking at him with a brilliant affectionate smile.",
    "He said\nheavily\n\nI always worry about you Lucy...\n\nTheres no need darling.",
    "And you see everything has actually turned\nout all right.",
    "John has been got rid of without our doing anything about\nit.",
    "It reminds me said Lady Angkatell reminiscently of that man in\nBombay who was so frightfully rude to me.",
    "He was run over by a tram\nthree days later.",
    "She unbolted the French window and went out into the garden.",
    "Sir Henry sat still watching her tall slender figure wander down the\npath.",
    "He looked old and tired and his face was the face of a man who\nlives at close quarters with fear.",
    "In the kitchen a tearful Doris Emmott was wilting under the stern\nreproof of Mr. Gudgeon.",
    "Mrs. Medway and Miss Simmons acted as a\nkind of Greek Chorus.",
    "Putting yourself forward and jumping to conclusions in a way only an\ninexperienced girl would do.",
    "Thats right said Mrs. Medway.",
    "If you see me with a pistol in my hand the proper thing to do is to\ncome to me and say Mr. Gudgeon will you be so kind as to give me an\nexplanation\n\nOr you could have come to me put in Mrs. Medway.",
    "Im always\nwilling to tell a young girl what doesnt know the world what she ought\nto think.",
    "What you should not have done said Gudgeon severely is to go\nbabbling off to a policeman  and only a Sergeant at that Never get\nmixed up with the police more than you can help.",
    "Its painful enough\nhaving them in the house at all.",
    "Inexpressibly painful murmured Miss Simmons.",
    "Such a thing never\nhappened to me before.",
    "We all know went on Gudgeon what her ladyship is like.",
    "Nothing\nher ladyship does would ever surprise me  but the police dont know\nher ladyship the way we do and its not to be thought of that her\n\n\fladyship should be worried with silly questions and suspicions just\nbecause she wanders about with firearms.",
    "Its the sort of thing she\nwould do but the police have the kind of minds that just see murder\nand nasty things like that.",
    "Her ladyship is the kind of absentminded\nlady who wouldnt hurt a fly but theres no denying that she puts things\nin funny places.",
    "I shall never forget added Gudgeon with feeling\nwhen she brought back a live lobster and put it in the card tray in the\nhall.",
    "Thought I was seeing things\n\nThat must have been before my time said Simmons with curiosity.",
    "Mrs. Medway checked these revelations with a glance at the erring\nDoris.",
    "Some other time she said.",
    "Now then Doris weve only been\nspeaking to you for your own good.",
    "Its common to be mixed up with\nthe police and dont you forget it.",
    "You can get on with the vegetables\nnow and be more careful with the runner beans than you were last\nnight.",
    "Doris sniffed.",
    "Yes Mrs. Medway she said and shuffled over to the sink.",
    "Mrs. Medway said forebodingly\n\nI dont feel as Im going to have a light hand with my pastry.",
    "That nasty\ninquest tomorrow.",
    "Gives me a turn every time I think of it.",
    "A thing like\nthat  happening to us.",
    "Chapter 22\n\nThe latch of the gate clicked and Poirot looked out of the window in\ntime to see the visitor who was coming up the path to the front door.",
    "He knew at once who she was.",
    "He wondered very much what brought\nVeronica Cray to see him.",
    "She brought a delicious faint scent into the room with her a scent that\nPoirot recognized.",
    "She wore tweeds and brogues as Henrietta had\ndone  but she was he decided very different from Henrietta.",
    "M. Poirot.",
    "Her tone was delighted a little thrilled.",
    "Ive only just\ndiscovered who my neighbour is.",
    "And Ive always wanted so much to\nknow you.",
    "He took her outstretched hands bowed over them.",
    "Enchanted Madame.",
    "She accepted the homage smilingly refused his offer of tea coffee or\ncocktail.",
    "No Ive just come to talk to you.",
    "To talk seriously.",
    "Im worried.",
    "You are worried I am sorry to hear that.",
    "Veronica sat down and sighed.",
    "Its about John Christows death.",
    "The inquests tomorrow.",
    "You know\nthat\n\nYes yes I know.",
    "And the whole thing has really been so extraordinary \n\nShe broke off.",
    "Most people really wouldnt believe it.",
    "But you would I think because\nyou know something about human nature.",
    "I know a little about human nature admitted Poirot.",
    "Inspector Grange came to see me.",
    "Hed got it into his head that Id\nquarrelled with John  which is true in a way though not in the way he\nmeant  I told him that I hadnt seen John for fifteen years  and he\nsimply didnt believe me.",
    "But its true M. Poirot.",
    "Poirot said Since it is true it can easily be proved so why worry\n\nShe returned his smile in the friendliest fashion.",
    "The real truth is that I simply havent dared to tell the Inspector what\nactually happened on Saturday evening.",
    "Its so absolutely fantastic\nthat he certainly wouldnt believe it.",
    "But I felt I must tell someone.",
    "Thats why I have come to you.",
    "Poirot said quietly I am flattered.",
    "That fact he noted she took for granted.",
    "She was a woman he\nthought who was very sure of the effect she was producing.",
    "So sure\nthat she might occasionally make a mistake.",
    "John and I were engaged to be married fifteen years ago.",
    "He was\nvery much in love with me  so much so that it rather alarmed me\nsometimes.",
    "He wanted me to give up acting  to give up having any\nmind or life of my own.",
    "He was so possessive and masterful that I felt I\ncouldnt go through with it and I broke off the engagement.",
    "Im afraid\nhe took that very hard.",
    "Poirot clicked a discreet and sympathetic tongue.",
    "I didnt see him again until last Saturday night.",
    "He walked home with\nme.",
    "I told the Inspector that we talked about old times  thats true in a\nway.",
    "But there was far more than that.",
    "Yes\n\nJohn went mad  quite mad.",
    "He wanted to leave his wife and children\nhe wanted me to get a divorce from my husband and marry him.",
    "He\nsaid hed never forgotten me  that the moment he saw me time stood\nstill...\n\nShe closed her eyes she swallowed.",
    "Under her makeup her face was\nvery pale.",
    "She opened her eyes again and smiled almost timidly at Poirot.",
    "Can you believe that a  a feeling like that is possible she asked.",
    "I think it is possible yes said Poirot.",
    "Never to forget  to go on waiting  planning  hoping to determine\nwith all ones heart and mind to get what one wants in the end...",
    "There\nare men like that M. Poirot.",
    "Yes  and women.",
    "She gave him a hard stare.",
    "Im talking about men  about John Christow.",
    "Well thats how it was.",
    "I\nprotested at first laughed refused to take him seriously.",
    "Then I told\nhim he was mad...",
    "It was quite late when he went back to the house.",
    "Wed argued and argued...",
    "He was still  just as determined.",
    "She swallowed again.",
    "Thats why I sent him a note the next morning.",
    "I\ncouldnt leave things like that.",
    "I had to make him realize that what he\nwanted was  impossible.",
    "It was impossible\n\nOf course it was impossible He came over.",
    "He wouldnt listen to what\nI had to say.",
    "He was just as insistent.",
    "I told him that it was no good that\nI didnt love him that I hated him... She paused breathing hard.",
    "I had\nto be brutal about it.",
    "So we parted in anger... And now  hes dead.",
    "He saw her hands creep together saw the twisted fingers and the\nknuckles stand out.",
    "They were large rather cruel hands.",
    "The strong emotion that she was feeling communicated itself to him.",
    "It\nwas not sorrow not grief  no it was anger.",
    "The anger he thought of a\nbaffled egoist.",
    "Well M. Poirot Her voice was controlled and smooth again.",
    "What\nam I to do Tell the story or keep it to myself.",
    "Its what happened  but\nit takes a bit of believing.",
    "Poirot looked at her a long considering gaze.",
    "He did not think that Veronica Cray was telling the truth and yet there\nwas an undeniable undercurrent of sincerity.",
    "It happened he thought\nbut it did not happen like that...\n\nAnd suddenly he got it.",
    "It was a true story inverted.",
    "It was she who\nhad been unable to forget John Christow.",
    "It was she who had been\nbaffled and repulsed.",
    "And now unable to bear in silence the furious\nanger of a tigress deprived of what she considered her legitimate\nprey she had invented a version of the truth that should satisfy her\nwounded pride and feed a little the aching hunger for a man who had\ngone beyond the reach of her clutching hands.",
    "Impossible to admit\nthat she Veronica Cray could not have what she wanted So she had\nchanged it all round.",
    "Poirot drew a deep breath and spoke\n\nIf all this had any bearing on John Christows death you would have\nto speak out but if it has not  and I cannot see why it should have then I think you are quite justified in keeping it to yourself.",
    "He wondered if she was disappointed.",
    "He had a fancy that in her\npresent mood she would like to hurl her story into the printed page of\na newspaper.",
    "She had come to him  why To try out her story To test\nhis reaction Or to use him  to induce him to pass the story on.",
    "If his mild response disappointed her she did not show it.",
    "She got up\nand gave him one of those long wellmanicured hands.",
    "Thank you M. Poirot.",
    "What you say seems eminently sensible.",
    "Im so\nglad I came to you.",
    "I  I felt I wanted somebody to know.",
    "I shall respect your confidence Madame.",
    "When she had gone he opened the windows a little.",
    "Scents affected\nhim.",
    "He did not like Veronicas scent.",
    "It was expensive but cloying\noverpowering like her personality.",
    "He wondered as he flapped the curtains whether Veronica Cray had\nkilled John Christow.",
    "She would have been willing to kill him  he believed that.",
    "She would\nhave enjoyed pressing the trigger  would have enjoyed seeing him\nstagger and fall.",
    "But behind that vindictive anger was something cold and shrewd\nsomething that appraised chances a cool calculating intelligence.",
    "However much Veronica Cray wished to kill John Christow he\ndoubted whether she would have taken the risk.",
    "Chapter 23\n\nThe inquest was over.",
    "It had been the merest formality of an affair and\nthough warned of this beforehand yet nearly everyone had a resentful\nsense of anticlimax.",
    "Adjourned for a fortnight at the request of the police.",
    "Gerda had driven down with Mrs. Patterson from London in a hired\nDaimler.",
    "She had on a black dress and an unbecoming hat and looked\nnervous and bewildered.",
    "Preparatory to stepping back into the Daimler she paused as Lady\nAngkatell came up to her.",
    "How are you Gerda dear Not sleeping too badly I hope.",
    "I think it\nwent off as well as we could hope for dont you So sorry we havent\ngot you with us at The Hollow but I quite understand how distressing\nthat would be.",
    "Mrs. Patterson said in her bright voice glancing reproachfully at her\nsister for not introducing her properly\n\nThis was Miss Colliers idea  to drive straight down and back.",
    "Expensive of course but we thought it was worth it.",
    "Oh I do so agree with you.",
    "Mrs. Patterson lowered her voice.",
    "I am taking Gerda and the children straight down to Bexhill.",
    "What she\nneeds is rest and quiet.",
    "The reporters Youve no idea Simply\nswarming round Harley Street.",
    "A young man snapped off a camera and Elsie Patterson pushed her\nsister into the car and they drove off.",
    "The others had a momentary view of Gerdas face beneath the\nunbecoming hat brim.",
    "It was vacant lost  she looked for the moment\nlike a halfwitted child.",
    "Midge Hardcastle muttered under her breath Poor devil.",
    "Edward said irritably\n\nWhat did everybody see in Christow That wretched woman looks\ncompletely heartbroken.",
    "She was absolutely wrapped up in him said Midge.",
    "But why He was a selfish sort of fellow good company in a way  but\n He broke off.",
    "Then he asked What did you think of him Midge\n\nI Midge reflected.",
    "She said at last rather surprised at her own\nwords I think I respected him.",
    "Respected him For what\n\nWell he knew his job.",
    "Youre thinking of him as a doctor\n\nYes.",
    "There was no time for more.",
    "Henrietta was driving Midge back to London in her car.",
    "Edward was\nreturning to lunch at The Hollow and going up by the afternoon train\nwith David.",
    "He said vaguely to Midge You must come out and lunch\none day and Midge said that that would be very nice but that she\ncouldnt take more than an hour off.",
    "Edward gave her his charming\nsmile and said\n\nOh its a special occasion.",
    "Im sure theyll understand.",
    "Then he moved towards Henrietta.",
    "Ill ring you up Henrietta.",
    "Yes do Edward.",
    "But I may be out a good deal.",
    "Out\n\nShe gave him a quick mocking smile.",
    "Drowning my sorrow.",
    "You dont expect me to sit at home and mope\ndo you\n\nHe said slowly I dont understand you nowadays Henrietta.",
    "You are\nquite different.",
    "Her face softened.",
    "She said unexpectedly Darling Edward and gave\nhis arm a quick squeeze.",
    "Then she turned to Lucy Angkatell.",
    "I can come back if I want to cant\nI Lucy\n\nLady Angkatell said Of course darling.",
    "And anyway there will be the\ninquest again in a fortnight.",
    "Henrietta went to where she had parked the car in the market square.",
    "Her suitcases and Midges were already inside.",
    "They got in and drove\noff.",
    "The car climbed the long hill and came out on the road over the ridge.",
    "Below them the brown and golden leaves shivered a little in the chill of\na grey Autumn day.",
    "Midge said suddenly Im glad to get away  even from Lucy.",
    "Darling\nas she is she gives me the creeps sometimes.",
    "Henrietta was looking intently into the small driving mirror.",
    "She said rather inattentively\n\nLucy has to give the coloratura touch  even to murder.",
    "You know Id never thought about murder before.",
    "Why should you It isnt a thing one thinks about.",
    "Its a sixletter word\nin a crossword or a pleasant entertainment between the covers of a\nbook.",
    "But the real thing \n\nShe paused.",
    "Midge finished\n\nIs real That is what startles one.",
    "Henrietta said\n\nIt neednt be startling to you.",
    "You are outside it.",
    "Perhaps the only one\nof us who is.",
    "Midge said\n\nWere all outside it now.",
    "Weve got away.",
    "Henrietta murmured Have we\n\nShe was looking in the driving mirror again.",
    "Suddenly she put her foot\ndown on the accelerator.",
    "The car responded.",
    "She glanced at the\nspeedometer.",
    "They were doing over fifty.",
    "Presently the needle\nreached sixty...\n\nMidge looked sideways at Henriettas profile.",
    "It was not like Henrietta\nto drive recklessly.",
    "She liked speed but the winding road hardly\njustified the pace they were going.",
    "There was a grim smile hovering\nround Henriettas mouth.",
    "She said Look over your shoulder Midge.",
    "See that car way back\nthere\n\nYes.",
    "Its a Ventnor 10.",
    "Is it Midge was not particularly interested.",
    "Theyre useful little cars low petrol consumption keep the road well\nbut theyre not fast.",
    "No\n\nCurious thought Midge how fascinated Henrietta always was by cars\nand their performance.",
    "As I say theyre not fast  but that car Midge has managed to keep\nits distance although weve been going over sixty.",
    "Midge turned a startled face to her.",
    "Do you mean that \n\nHenrietta nodded.",
    "The police I believe have special engines in very\nordinarylooking cars.",
    "Midge said\n\nYou mean theyre still keeping an eye on us all\n\n\fIt seems rather obvious.",
    "Midge shivered.",
    "Henrietta can you understand the meaning of this second gun\nbusiness\n\nNo it lets Gerda out.",
    "But beyond that it just doesnt seem to add up to\nanything.",
    "But if it was one of Henrys guns \n\nWe dont know that it was.",
    "It hasnt been found yet remember.",
    "No thats true.",
    "It could be someone outside altogether.",
    "Do you know\nwho Id like to think killed John Henrietta That woman.",
    "Veronica Cray\n\nYes.",
    "Henrietta said nothing.",
    "She drove on with her eyes fixed sternly on the\nroad ahead of her.",
    "Dont you think its possible persisted Midge.",
    "Possible yes said Henrietta slowly.",
    "Then you dont think \n\n\fIts no good thinking a thing because you want to think it.",
    "Its the\nperfect solution  letting all of us out\n\nUs But \n\nWere in it  all of us.",
    "Even you Midge darling  though theyd be hard\nput to it to find a motive for your shooting John Of course Id like it to\nbe Veronica.",
    "Nothing would please me better than to see her giving a\nlovely performance as Lucy would put it in the dock\n\nMidge shot a quick look at her.",
    "Tell me Henrietta does it all make you feel vindictive\n\nYou mean  Henrietta paused a moment  because I loved John\n\nYes.",
    "As she spoke Midge realized with a slight sense of shock that this was\nthe first time the bald fact had been put into words.",
    "It had been\naccepted by them all by Lucy and Henry by Midge by Edward even\nthat Henrietta loved John Christow but nobody had ever so much as\nhinted at the fact in words before.",
    "There was a pause whilst Henrietta seemed to be thinking.",
    "Then she\nsaid in a thoughtful voice\n\nI cant explain to you what I feel.",
    "Perhaps I dont know myself.",
    "They were driving now over Albert Bridge.",
    "Henrietta said\n\nYoud better come to the studio Midge.",
    "Well have tea and Ill drive\nyou to your digs afterwards.",
    "Here in London the short afternoon light was already fading.",
    "They\ndrew up at the studio door and Henrietta put her key into the door.",
    "She\nwent in and switched on the light.",
    "Its chilly she said.",
    "Wed better light the gas fire.",
    "Oh bother  I\nmeant to get some matches on the way.",
    "Wont a lighter do\n\nMines no good and anyway its difficult to light a gas fire with one.",
    "Make yourself at home.",
    "Theres an old blind man stands on the corner.",
    "I usually get my matches off him.",
    "I shant be a minute or two.",
    "Left alone in the studio Midge wandered round looking at Henriettas\nwork.",
    "It gave her an eerie feeling to be sharing the empty studio with\nthese creations of wood and bronze.",
    "There was a bronze head with high cheekbones and a tin hat possibly\na Red Army soldier and there was an airy structure of twisted ribbonlike aluminum which intrigued her a good deal.",
    "There was a vast static\nfrog in pinkish granite and at the end of the studio she came to an\nalmost lifesized wooden figure.",
    "She was staring at it when Henriettas key turned in the lock and\nHenrietta herself came in slightly breathless.",
    "Midge turned.",
    "Whats this Henrietta Its rather frightening.",
    "That Thats The Worshipper.",
    "Its going to the International Group.",
    "Midge repeated staring at it\n\nIts frightening...\n\nKneeling to light the gas fire Henrietta said over her shoulder\n\nIts interesting your saying that.",
    "Why do you find it frightening\n\nI think  because it hasnt any face...\n\nHow right you are Midge...\n\nIts very good Henrietta.",
    "Henrietta said lightly Its a nice bit of pear wood...\n\nShe rose from her knees.",
    "She tossed her big satchel bag and her furs\non to the divan and threw down a couple of boxes of matches on the\ntable.",
    "Midge was struck by the expression on her face  it had a sudden quite\ninexplicable exultation.",
    "Now for tea said Henrietta and in her voice was the same warm\njubilation that Midge had already glimpsed in her face.",
    "It struck an almost jarring note  but Midge forgot it in a train of thought\naroused by the sight of the two boxes of matches.",
    "You remember those matches Veronica Cray took away with her\n\nWhen Lucy insisted on foisting a whole half dozen on her Yes.",
    "Did anyone ever find out whether she had matches in her cottage all\nthe time\n\nI expect the police did.",
    "Theyre very thorough.",
    "A faintly triumphant smile was curving Henriettas lips.",
    "Midge felt\npuzzled and almost repelled.",
    "She thought Can Henrietta really have cared for John Can she\nSurely not.",
    "And a faint desolate chill struck through her as she reflected\n\nEdward will not have to wait very long...\n\nUngenerous of her not to let that thought bring warmth.",
    "She wanted\nEdward to be happy didnt she It wasnt as though she could have\n\n\fEdward herself.",
    "To Edward she would be always little Midge.",
    "Never\nmore than that.",
    "Never a woman to be loved.",
    "Edward unfortunately was the faithful kind.",
    "Well the faithful kind\nusually got what they wanted in the end.",
    "Edward and Henrietta at Ainswick... that was the proper ending to the\nstory.",
    "Edward and Henrietta living happy ever afterwards...\n\nShe could see it all very clearly...",
    "Cheer up Midge said Henrietta.",
    "You mustnt let murder get you\ndown.",
    "Shall we go out later and have a spot of dinner together\n\nBut Midge said quickly that she must get back to her rooms.",
    "She had\nthings to do  letters to write.",
    "In fact shed better go as soon as shed\nfinished her cup of tea.",
    "All right.",
    "Ill drive you there.",
    "I could get a taxi.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Lets use the car as its here.",
    "They went out into damp evening air.",
    "As they drove past the end of the\nMews Henrietta pointed out a car drawn in to the side.",
    "A Ventnor 10.",
    "Our shadow.",
    "Youll see.",
    "Hell follow us.",
    "How beastly it all is\n\n\fDo you think so I dont really mind.",
    "Henrietta dropped Midge at her rooms and came back to the Mews\nand put her car away in the garage.",
    "Then she let herself into the studio once more.",
    "For some minutes she stood abstractedly drumming with her fingers\non the mantelpiece.",
    "Then she sighed and murmured to herself\n\nWell  to work...",
    "Better not waste time.",
    "She threw off her tweeds and got into her overall.",
    "An hour and a half later she drew back and studied what she had done.",
    "There were dabs of clay on her cheek and her hair was dishevelled\nbut she nodded approval at the model on the stand.",
    "It was the rough similitude of a horse.",
    "The clay had been slapped on in\ngreat irregular lumps.",
    "It was the kind of horse that would have given\nthe Colonel of a Cavalry Regiment apoplexy so unlike was it to any\nflesh and blood horse that had ever been foaled.",
    "It would also have\ndistressed Henriettas Irish hunting forbears.",
    "Nevertheless it was a\nhorse  a horse conceived in the abstract.",
    "Henrietta wondered what Inspector Grange would think of it if he ever\nsaw it and her mouth widened a little in amusement as she pictured\nhis face.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nEdward Angkatell stood hesitantly in the swirl of foot traffic in\nShaftesbury\n\nAvenue.",
    "He\n\nwas\n\nnerving\n\nhimself\n\nto\n\nenter\n\nthe\n\nestablishment which bore the goldlettered sign Madame Alfrege.",
    "Some obscure instinct had prevented him from merely ringing up and\nasking Midge to come out and lunch.",
    "That fragment of telephone\nconversation at The Hollow had disturbed him  more had shocked\nhim.",
    "There had been in Midges voice a submission a subservience\nthat had outraged all his feelings.",
    "For Midge the free the cheerful the outspoken to have to adopt that\nattitude.",
    "To have to submit as she clearly was submitting to rudeness\nand insolence on the other end of the wire.",
    "It was all wrong  the whole\nthing was wrong And then when he had shown his concern she had\nmet him pointblank with the unpalatable truth that one had to keep\nones job that jobs werent easy to get and that the holding down of a\njob entailed more unpleasantnesses than the mere performing of a\nstipulated task.",
    "Up till then Edward had vaguely accepted the fact that a great many\nyoung women had jobs nowadays.",
    "If he had thought about it at all he\nhad thought that on the whole they had jobs because they liked jobs that it flattered their sense of independence and gave them an interest\nof their own in life.",
    "The fact that a working day of nine to six with an hour off for lunch cut\na girl off from most of the pleasures and relaxations of a leisured class\nhad simply not occurred to Edward.",
    "That Midge unless she sacrificed\nher lunch hour could not drop into a picture gallery that she could not\ngo to an afternoon concert drive out of town on a fine summers day\nlunch in a leisurely way at a distant restaurant but had instead to\nrelegate her excursions into the country to Saturday afternoons and\nSundays and to snatch her lunch in a crowded Lyons or a snack bar\nwas a new and unwelcome discovery.",
    "He was very fond of Midge.",
    "Little\nMidge  that was how he thought of her.",
    "Arriving shy and wideeyed at\nAinswick for the holidays tonguetied at first then opening up into\nenthusiasm and affection.",
    "Edwards tendency to live exclusively in the past and to accept the\npresent dubiously as something as yet untested had delayed his\nrecognition of Midge as a wageearning adult.",
    "It was on that evening at The Hollow when he had come in cold and\nshivering from that strange upsetting clash with Henrietta and when\nMidge had knelt to build up the fire that he had been first aware of a\nMidge who was not an affectionate child but a woman.",
    "It had been an\nupsetting vision  he had felt for a moment that he had lost something something that was a precious part of Ainswick.",
    "And he had said\nimpulsively speaking out of that suddenly aroused feeling I wish I\nsaw you more often Midge my dear...",
    "Standing outside in the moonlight speaking to a Henrietta who was no\nlonger suddenly the familiar Henrietta he had loved for so long  he\nhad known sudden panic.",
    "And he had come in to a further disturbance\nof the set pattern which was his life.",
    "Little Midge was also a part of\n\n\fAinswick  and this was no longer Little Midge  but a courageous and\nsadeyed adult whom he did not know.",
    "Ever since then he had been troubled in his mind and had indulged in\na good deal of selfreproach for the unthinking way in which he had\nnever bothered about Midges happiness or comfort.",
    "The idea of her\nuncongenial job at Madame Alfreges had worried him more and more\nand he had determined at last to see for himself just what this dress\nshop of hers was like.",
    "Edward peered suspiciously into the show window at a little black\ndress with a narrow gold belt some rakishlooking skimpy jumper\nsuits and an evening gown of rather tawdry coloured lace.",
    "Edward knew nothing about womens clothes except by instinct but\nhad a shrewd idea that all these exhibits were somehow of a\nmeretricious order.",
    "No he thought this place was not worthy of her.",
    "Someone  Lucy Angkatell perhaps  must do something about it.",
    "Overcoming his shyness with an effort Edward straightened his\nslightly stooping shoulders and walked in.",
    "He was instantly paralyzed with embarrassment.",
    "Two platinum blonde\nlittle minxes with shrill voices were examining dresses in a showcase\nwith a dark saleswoman in attendance.",
    "At the back of the shop a small\nwoman with a thick nose hennared hair and a disagreeable voice was\narguing with a stout and bewildered customer over some alterations to\nan evening gown.",
    "From an adjacent cubicle a womans fretful voice\nwas raised.",
    "Frightful  perfectly frightful  cant you bring me anything decent to\ntry\n\nIn response he heard the soft murmur of Midges voice  a deferential\npersuasive voice\n\nThis wine model is really very smart.",
    "And I think it would suit you.",
    "If\nyoud just slip it on \n\nIm not going to waste my time trying on things that I can see are no\ngood.",
    "Do take a little trouble.",
    "Ive told you I dont want reds.",
    "If youd\njust listen to what you are told \n\nThe colour surged up into Edwards neck.",
    "He hoped Midge would\nthrow the dress in the odious womans face.",
    "Instead she murmured\n\nIll have another look.",
    "You wouldnt care for green I suppose\nMadam Or this peach\n\nDreadful  perfectly dreadful No I wont see anything more.",
    "Sheer\nwaste of time \n\nBut now Madame Alfrege detaching herself from the stout customer\nhad come down to Edward and was looking at him inquiringly.",
    "He pulled himself together.",
    "Is  could I speak  is Miss Hardcastle here\n\n\fMadame Alfreges eyebrows went up  but she took in the Savile Row\ncut of Edwards clothes\n\nand she produced\n\na smile\n\nwhose\n\ngraciousness was rather more unpleasant than her bad temper would\nhave been.",
    "From inside the cubicle the fretful voice rose sharply\n\nDo be careful How clumsy you are.",
    "Youve torn my hair net.",
    "And Midge her voice unsteady\n\nIm very sorry Madam.",
    "Stupid clumsiness.",
    "The voice disappeared muffled.",
    "No Ill do it myself.",
    "My belt please.",
    "Miss Hardcastle will be free in a minute said Madame Alfrege.",
    "Her\nsmile was now a leer.",
    "A sandyhaired badtempered looking woman emerged from the\ncubicle carrying several parcels and went out into the street.",
    "Midge\nin a severe black dress opened the door for her.",
    "She looked pale and\nunhappy.",
    "Ive come to take you out to lunch said Edward without preamble.",
    "Midge gave a harried glance up at the clock.",
    "I dont get off until quarter past one she began.",
    "It was ten past one.",
    "Madame Alfrege said graciously\n\nYou can go off now if you like Miss Hardcastle as your friend has\ncalled for you.",
    "Midge murmured Uh thank you Madame Alfrege and to Edward\nIll be ready in a minute and disappeared into the back of the shop.",
    "Edward who had winced under the impact of Madame Alfreges heavy\nemphasis on friend stood helplessly waiting.",
    "Madame Alfrege was just about to enter into arch conversation with\nhim when the door opened and an opulentlooking woman with a\nPekingese came in and Madame Alfreges business instincts took her\nforward to the newcomer.",
    "Midge reappeared with her coat on and taking her by the elbow\nEdward steered her out of the shop into the street.",
    "My God he said is that the sort of thing you have to put up with I\nheard that damned woman talking to you behind the curtain.",
    "How can\nyou stick it Midge Why didnt you throw the damned frocks at her\nhead\n\nId soon lose my job if I did things like that.",
    "But dont you want to fling things at a woman of that kind\n\nMidge drew a deep breath.",
    "Of course I do.",
    "And there are times especially at the end of a hot\nweek during the summer sales when I am afraid that one day I shall let\ngo and just tell everyone exactly where they get off  instead of Yes\nMadam no Madam  Ill see if we have anything else Madam.",
    "Midge dear little Midge you cant put up with all this\n\nMidge laughed a little shakily.",
    "Dont be so upset Edward.",
    "Why on earth did you have to come here\nWhy not ring up\n\nI wanted to see for myself.",
    "Ive been worried...",
    "He paused and then\nbroke out.",
    "Why Lucy wouldnt talk to a scullery maid the way that\nwoman talked to you.",
    "Its all wrong that you should have to put up with\ninsolence and rudeness.",
    "Good God Midge Id like to take you right out\nof it all down to Ainswick.",
    "Id like to hail a taxi bundle you into it and\ntake you down to Ainswick now by the 215.",
    "Midge stopped.",
    "Her assumed nonchalance fell from her.",
    "She had had a\nlong tiring morning with trying customers and Madame at her most\nbullying.",
    "She turned on Edward with a sudden flare of resentment.",
    "Well then why dont you There are plenty of taxis\n\n\fHe stared at her taken aback by her sudden fury.",
    "She went on her\nanger flaming up\n\nWhy do you have to come along and say these things You dont mean\nthem.",
    "Do you think it makes it any easier after Ive had the hell of a\nmorning to be reminded that there are places like Ainswick Do you\nthink Im grateful to you for standing there and babbling about how\nmuch youd like to take me out of it all All very sweet and insincere.",
    "You dont really mean a word of it.",
    "Dont you know that Id sell my soul\nto catch the 215 to Ainswick and get away from everything I cant\nbear even to think of Ainswick do you understand You mean well\nEdward but youre cruel Saying things  just saying things...",
    "They faced each other seriously incommoding the lunchtime crowd in\nShaftesbury Avenue.",
    "Yet they were conscious of nothing but each\nother.",
    "Edward was staring at her like a man suddenly aroused from\nsleep.",
    "He said All right then damn it.",
    "Youre coming to Ainswick by the\n215\n\nHe raised his stick and hailed a passing taxi.",
    "It drew into the curb.",
    "Edward opened the door and Midge slightly dazed got in.",
    "Edward\nsaid Paddington Station to the driver and followed her in.",
    "They sat in silence.",
    "Midges lips were set together.",
    "Her eyes were\ndefiant and mutinous.",
    "Edward stared straight ahead of him.",
    "As they waited for the traffic lights in Oxford Street Midge said\ndisagreeably\n\n\fI seem to have called your bluff.",
    "Edward said shortly\n\nIt wasnt bluff.",
    "The taxi started forward again with a jerk.",
    "It was not until the taxi turned left in Edgware Road into Cambridge\nTerrace that Edward suddenly regained his normal attitude to life.",
    "He said We cant catch the 215 and tapping on the glass he said to\nthe driver Go to the Berkeley.",
    "Midge said coldly Why cant we catch the 215 Its only twentyfive\npast one now.",
    "Edward smiled at her.",
    "You havent got any luggage little Midge.",
    "No nightgowns or\ntoothbrushes or country shoes.",
    "Theres a 415 you know.",
    "Well have\nsome lunch now and talk things over.",
    "Midge sighed.",
    "Thats so like you Edward.",
    "To remember the practical side.",
    "Impulse\ndoesnt carry you very far does it Oh well it was a nice dream while\nit lasted.",
    "She slipped her hand into his and gave him her old smile.",
    "Im sorry I stood on the pavement and abused you like a fishwife she\nsaid.",
    "But you know Edward you were irritating.",
    "Yes he said I must have been.",
    "They went into the Berkeley happily side by side.",
    "They got a table by\nthe window and Edward ordered an excellent lunch.",
    "As they finished their chicken Midge sighed and said I ought to hurry\nback to the shop.",
    "My times up.",
    "Youre going to take decent time over your lunch today even if I have\nto go back and buy half the clothes in the shop\n\nDear Edward you are really rather sweet.",
    "They ate cr\u00eapes suzette and then the waiter brought them coffee.",
    "Edward stirred his sugar in with his spoon.",
    "He said gently\n\nYou really do love Ainswick dont you\n\nMust we talk about Ainswick Ive survived not catching the 215  and\nI quite realize that there isnt any question of the 415  but dont rub it\nin.",
    "Edward smiled.",
    "No Im not proposing that we catch the 415.",
    "But I am suggesting that\nyou come to Ainswick Midge.",
    "Im suggesting that you come there for\ngood  that is if you can put up with me.",
    "She stared at him over the rim of her coffee cup  put it down with a\nhand that she managed to keep steady.",
    "What do you really mean Edward\n\nIm suggesting that you should marry me Midge.",
    "I dont suppose that\nIm a very romantic proposition.",
    "Im a dull dog I know that and not\nmuch good at anything  I just read books and potter around.",
    "But\nalthough Im not a very exciting person weve known each other a long\ntime and I think that Ainswick itself would  well would compensate.",
    "I\nthink youd be happy at Ainswick Midge.",
    "Will you come\n\nMidge swallowed once or twice  then she said\n\nBut I thought  Henrietta  and stopped.",
    "Edward said his voice level and unemotional\n\nYes Ive asked Henrietta three times to marry me.",
    "Each time she has\nrefused.",
    "Henrietta knows what she doesnt want.",
    "There was a silence and then Edward said\n\nWell Midge dear what about it\n\n\fMidge looked up at him.",
    "There was a catch in her voice.",
    "She said\n\nIt seems so extraordinary  to be offered heaven on a plate as it were\nat the Berkeley\n\nHis face lighted up.",
    "He laid his hand over hers for a brief moment.",
    "Heaven on a plate he said.",
    "So you feel like that about Ainswick...\nOh Midge Im glad.",
    "They sat there happily.",
    "Edward paid the bill and added an enormous\ntip.",
    "The people in the restaurant were thinning out.",
    "Midge said with an\neffort\n\nWell have to go...",
    "I suppose Id better go back to Madame Alfrege.",
    "After all shes counting on me.",
    "I cant just walk out.",
    "No I suppose youll have to go back and resign or hand in your\nnotice or whatever you call it.",
    "Youre not to go on working there\nthough.",
    "I wont have it.",
    "But first I thought wed better go to one of those\nshops in Bond Street where they sell rings.",
    "Rings\n\nIts usual isnt it\n\nMidge laughed.",
    "In the dimmed lighting of the jewellers shop Midge and Edward bent\nover trays of sparkling engagement rings whilst a discreet salesman\nwatched them benignantly.",
    "Edward said pushing away a velvetcovered tray\n\nNot emeralds.",
    "Henrietta in green tweeds  Henrietta in an evening dress like Chinese\njade...\n\nNo not emeralds...\n\nMidge pushed away the tiny stabbing pain at her heart.",
    "Choose for me she said to Edward.",
    "He bent over the tray before them.",
    "He picked out a ring with a single\ndiamond.",
    "Not a very large stone but a stone of beautiful colour and\nfire.",
    "I like this.",
    "Midge nodded.",
    "She loved this display of Edwards unerring and\nfastidious taste.",
    "She slipped it on her finger as Edward and the\nshopman drew aside.",
    "Edward wrote out a check for three hundred and fortytwo pounds and\ncame back to Midge smiling.",
    "He said Lets go and be rude to Madame Alfrege.",
    "Chapter 25\n\nBut darlings I am so delighted\n\nLady Angkatell stretched out a fragile hand to Edward and touched\nMidge softly with the other.",
    "You did quite right Edward to make her leave that horrid shop and to\nbring her right down here.",
    "Shell stay here of course and be married\nfrom here  St. Georges you know three miles by the road though\nonly a mile through the woods but then one doesnt go to a wedding\nthrough woods.",
    "And I suppose it will have to be the Vicar  poor man\nhe has such dreadful colds in the head every Autumn  the Curate now\nhas one of those high Anglican voices and the whole thing would be\nfar more impressive  and more religious too if you know what I mean.",
    "It is so hard to keep ones mind reverent when somebody is saying\nthings through the nose.",
    "It was Midge decided a very Lucyish reception.",
    "It made her want to\nboth laugh and cry.",
    "Id love to be married from here Lucy she said.",
    "Then thats settled darling.",
    "Offwhite satin I think and an ivory\nprayer book  not a bouquet.",
    "Bridesmaids\n\n\fNo.",
    "I dont want a fuss.",
    "Just a very quiet wedding.",
    "I know what you mean darling  and I think perhaps you are right.",
    "With an Autumn wedding its nearly always chrysanthemums  such an\nuninspiring flower I always think.",
    "And unless one takes a lot of time to\nchoose them carefully bridesmaids never match properly and theres\nnearly always one terribly plain one who ruins the whole effect  but\none has to have her because shes usually the bridegrooms sister.",
    "But of course  Lady Angkatell beamed.",
    "Edward hasnt got any\nsisters.",
    "That seems to be one point in my favour.",
    "said Edward smiling.",
    "But children are really the worst at weddings went on Lady\nAngkatell happily pursuing her own train of thought.",
    "Everyone says\nHow sweet but my dear the anxiety They step on the train or else\nthey howl for Nannie and quite often theyre sick.",
    "I always wonder how\na girl can go up the aisle in a proper frame of mind while shes so\nuncertain about what is happening behind her.",
    "There neednt be anything behind me said Midge cheerfully.",
    "Not\neven a train.",
    "I can be married in a coat and skirt.",
    "Oh no Midge thats so like a widow.",
    "No offwhite satin and not from\nMadame Alfreges.",
    "Certainly not from Madame Alfreges said Edward.",
    "I shall take you to Mireille said Lady Angkatell.",
    "My dear Lucy.",
    "I cant possibly afford Mireille.",
    "Nonsense Midge.",
    "Henry and I are going to give you your trousseau.",
    "And Henry of course will give you away.",
    "I do hope the band of his\ntrousers wont be too tight.",
    "Its nearly two years since he last went to a\nwedding.",
    "And I shall wear \n\nLady Angkatell paused and closed her eyes.",
    "Yes Lucy\n\nHydrangea blue.",
    "announced Lady Angkatell in a rapt voice.",
    "I\nsuppose Edward you will have one of your own friends for best man\notherwise of course there is David.",
    "I cannot help feeling it would be\nfrightfully good for David.",
    "It would give him poise you know and he\nwould feel we all liked him.",
    "That I am sure is very important with\nDavid.",
    "It must be so disheartening you know to feel you are clever\nand intellectual and yet nobody likes you any the better for it But of\ncourse it would be rather a risk.",
    "He would probably lose the ring or\ndrop it at the last minute.",
    "I expect it would worry Edward too much.",
    "But\nit would be nice in a way to keep it to the same people weve had here\nfor the murder.",
    "Lady Angkatell uttered the last few words in the most conversational\nof tones.",
    "Lady Angkatell has been entertaining a few friends for a murder this\nAutumn Midge could not help saying.",
    "Yes said Lucy meditatively.",
    "I suppose it did sound like that.",
    "A party\nfor the shooting... You know when you come to think of it thats just\nwhat it has been\n\nMidge gave a faint shiver and said\n\nWell at any rate its over now.",
    "Its not exactly over  the inquest was only adjourned.",
    "And that nice\nInspector Grange has got men all over the place simply crashing\nthrough the chestnut woods and startling all the pheasants and\nspringing up like jacksinthebox in the most unlikely places.",
    "What are they looking for asked Edward.",
    "The revolver that\nChristow was shot with\n\nI imagine that must be it.",
    "They even came to the house with a search\nwarrant  the Inspector was most apologetic about it quite shy  but of\ncourse I told him we should be delighted.",
    "It was really most\ninteresting.",
    "They looked absolutely everywhere.",
    "I followed them\nround you know and I suggested one or two places which even they\nhadnt thought of.",
    "But they didnt find anything.",
    "It was most\ndisappointing.",
    "Poor Inspector Grange he is growing quite thin and he\npulls and pulls at that moustache of his.",
    "His wife ought to give him\nspecially nourishing meals with all this worry he is having  but I have a\nvague idea that she must be one of those women who care more about\nhaving the linoleum really wellpolished than in cooking a tasty little\nmeal.",
    "Which reminds me I must go and see Mrs. Medway.",
    "Funny how\nservants cannot bear the police.",
    "Her cheese souffle last night was\nquite uneatable.",
    "Souffles and pastry always show if one is off balance.",
    "If it werent for Gudgeon keeping them all together I really believe half\nthe servants would leave.",
    "Why dont you two go and have a nice walk\nand help the police look for the revolver\n\nHercule Poirot sat on the bench overlooking the chestnut groves\nabove the pool.",
    "He had no sense of trespassing since Lady Angkatell\nhad very sweetly begged him to wander where he would at any time.",
    "It\nwas Lady Angkatells sweetness which Hercule Poirot was considering\nat this moment.",
    "From time to time he heard the cracking of twigs in the woods above or\ncaught sight of a figure moving through the chestnut groves below\nhim.",
    "Presently Henrietta came along the path from the direction of the\nlane.",
    "She stopped for a moment when she saw Poirot then she came\nand sat down by him.",
    "Good morning M. Poirot.",
    "I have just been to call upon you.",
    "But you\nwere out.",
    "You look very Olympian.",
    "Are you presiding over the hunt\nThe Inspector seems very active.",
    "What are they looking for The\nrevolver\n\nYes Miss Savernake.",
    "Will they find it do you think\n\nI think so.",
    "Quite soon now I should say\n\n\fShe looked at him inquiringly.",
    "Have you an idea then where it is\n\nNo.",
    "But I think it will be found soon.",
    "It is time for it to be found.",
    "You do say odd things M. Poirot\n\nOdd things happen here.",
    "You have come back very soon from\nLondon Mademoiselle.",
    "Her face hardened.",
    "She gave a short bitter laugh.",
    "The murderer returns to the scene of the crime That is the old\nsuperstition isnt it So you do think that I did it You dont believe me\nwhen I tell you that I wouldnt  that I couldnt kill anybody\n\nPoirot did not answer at once.",
    "At last he said thoughtfully\n\nIt has seemed to me from the beginning that either this crime was\nvery simple  so simple that it was difficult to believe its simplicity and\nsimplicity Mademoiselle can be strangely baffling or else it was\nextremely complex  that is to say we were contending against a mind\ncapable of intricate and ingenious inventions so that every time we\nseemed to be heading for the truth we were actually being led on a\ntrail that twisted away from the truth and led us to a point which ended\nin nothingness.",
    "This apparent futility this continual barrenness is not\nreal  it is artificial it is planned.",
    "A very subtle and ingenious mind is\nplotting against us the whole time  and succeeding.",
    "Well said Henrietta.",
    "What has that to do with me\n\nThe mind that is plotting against us is a creative mind Mademoiselle.",
    "I see  thats where I come in\n\nShe was silent her lips set together bitterly.",
    "From her jacket pocket\nshe had taken a pencil and now she was idly drawing the outline of a\nfantastic tree on the white painted wood of the bench frowning down\nas she did so.",
    "Poirot watched her.",
    "Something stirred in his mind  standing in Lady\nAngkatells drawingroom on the afternoon of the crime looking down\nat a pile of bridge markers standing by a painted iron table in the\npavilion the next morning and a question that he had put to Gudgeon.",
    "He said\n\nThat is what you drew on your bridge marker  a tree.",
    "Yes.",
    "Henrietta seemed suddenly aware of what she was doing.",
    "Ygdrasil M. Poirot.",
    "She laughed.",
    "Why do you call it Ygdrasil\n\nShe explained the origin of Ygdrasil.",
    "And so  when you doodle that is the word is it not  it is always\nYgdrasil you draw\n\n\fYes.",
    "Doodling is a funny thing isnt it\n\nHere on the seat... on the bridge marker on Saturday evening... in the\npavilion on Sunday morning...",
    "The hand that held the pencil stiffened and stopped.",
    "She said in a tone\nof careless amusement\n\nIn the pavilion\n\nYes on the round iron table there.",
    "Oh that must have been on  on Saturday afternoon.",
    "It was not on Saturday afternoon.",
    "When Gudgeon brought the glasses\nout to the pavilion about twelve oclock on Sunday morning there was\nnothing drawn on the table.",
    "I asked him and he is quite definite about\nthat.",
    "Then it must have been  she hesitated for just a moment  of\ncourse on Sunday afternoon.",
    "But still smiling pleasantly Hercule Poirot shook his head.",
    "I think not.",
    "Granges men were at the pool all Sunday afternoon\nphotographing the body getting the revolver out of the water.",
    "They did\nnot leave until dusk.",
    "They would have seen anyone go into the\npavilion.",
    "Henrietta said slowly\n\n\fI remember now  I went along there quite late in the evening  after\ndinner \n\nPoirots voice came sharply\n\nPeople do not doodle in the dark Miss Savernake.",
    "Are you telling me\nthat you went into the pavilion at night and stood by a table and drew a\ntree without being able to see what you were drawing\n\nHenrietta said calmly\n\nI am telling you the truth.",
    "Naturally you dont believe it.",
    "You have your\nown ideas  What is your idea by the way\n\nI am suggesting that you were in the pavilion on Sunday morning after\ntwelve oclock when Gudgeon brought the glasses out.",
    "That you stood\nby that table watching someone or waiting for someone and\nunconsciously took out a pencil and drew Ygdrasil without being fully\naware of what you were doing.",
    "I was not in the pavilion on Sunday morning.",
    "I sat out on the terrace\nfor a while then I got the gardening basket and went up to the dahlia\nborder and cut off heads and tied up some of the Michaelmas daisies\nthat were untidy.",
    "Then just on one oclock I went along to the pool.",
    "Ive been through it all with Inspector Grange.",
    "I never came near the\npool until one oclock just after John had been shot.",
    "That said Hercule Poirot is your story.",
    "But Ygdrasil Mademoiselle\ntestifies against you.",
    "I was in the pavilion and I shot John thats what you mean\n\nYou were there and you shot Dr. Christow or you were there and you\nsaw who shot Dr. Christow  or someone else was there who knew\nabout Ygdrasil and deliberately drew it on the table to put suspicion on\nyou.",
    "Henrietta got up.",
    "She turned on him with her chin lifted.",
    "You still think that I shot John Christow.",
    "You think that you can prove I\nshot him.",
    "Well I will tell you this.",
    "You will never prove it.",
    "Never\n\nYou think that you are cleverer than I am\n\nYou will never prove it said Henrietta and turning she walked away\ndown the winding path that led to the swimming pool.",
    "Chapter 26\n\nGrange came into Resthaven to drink a cup of tea with Hercule Poirot.",
    "The tea was exactly what he had had apprehensions it might be extremely weak and China tea at that.",
    "These foreigners thought Grange dont know how to make tea you cant teach em.",
    "But he did not mind much.",
    "He was in a condition\nof pessimism when one more thing that was unsatisfactory actually\nafforded him a kind of grim satisfaction.",
    "He said The adjourned inquests the day after tomorrow and where\nhave we got Nowhere at all.",
    "What the hell that gun must be\nsomewhere Its this damned country  miles of woods.",
    "It would take an\narmy to search them properly.",
    "Talk of a needle in a haystack.",
    "It may be\nanywhere.",
    "The fact is weve got to face up to it  we may never find\nthat gun.",
    "You will find it said Poirot confidently.",
    "Well it wont be for want of trying\n\nYou will find it sooner or later.",
    "And I should say sooner.",
    "Another cup\nof tea\n\nI dont mind if I do  no no hot water.",
    "It is not too strong\n\nOh no its not too strong.",
    "The Inspector was conscious of\nunderstatement.",
    "Gloomily he sipped at the pale strawcoloured beverage.",
    "This case is making a monkey of me M. Poirot  a monkey of me I\ncant get the hang of these people.",
    "They seem helpful  but everything\nthey tell you seems to lead you away on a wildgoose chase.",
    "Away said Poirot.",
    "A startled look came into his eyes.",
    "Yes I see.",
    "Away...",
    "The Inspector was developing his grievance.",
    "Take the gun now.",
    "Christow was shot  according to the medical\nevidence  only a minute or two before your arrival.",
    "Lady Angkatell had\nthat egg basket Miss Savernake had a gardening basket full of dead\nflower heads and Edward Angkatell was wearing a loose shooting\ncoat with large pockets stuffed with cartridges.",
    "Anyone of them could\nhave carried the revolver away with them.",
    "It wasnt hidden anywhere\nnear the pool  my men have raked the place so thats definitely out.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Grange went on\n\nGerda Christow was framed  by whom Thats where every clue I\nfollow seems to vanish into thin air.",
    "Their stories of how they spent the morning are satisfactory\n\nThe stories are all right.",
    "Miss Savernake was gardening.",
    "Lady\nAngkatell was collecting eggs.",
    "Edward Angkatell and Sir Henry were\nshooting and separated at the end of the morning  Sir Henry coming\nback to the house and Edward Angkatell coming down here through\nthe woods.",
    "The young fellow was up in his bedroom reading.",
    "Funny\nplace to read on a nice day but hes the indoor bookish kind.",
    "Miss\nHardcastle took a book down to the orchard.",
    "All sounds very natural\nand likely and theres no means of checking up on it.",
    "Gudgeon took a\ntray of glasses out to the pavillion about twelve oclock.",
    "He cant say\nwhere any of the house party were or what they were doing.",
    "In a way\nyou know theres something against almost all of them\n\n\fReally\n\nOf course the most obvious person is Veronica Cray she had\nquarrelled with Christow she hated his guts shes quite likely to have\nshot him  but I cant find the least iota of proof that she did shoot him.",
    "No evidence as to her having had any opportunity to pinch the\nrevolvers from Sir Henrys collection no one who saw her going to or\nfrom the pool that day.",
    "And the missing revolver definitely isnt in her\npossession now.",
    "Ah you have made sure of that\n\nWhat do you think The evidence would have justified a search\nwarrant but there was no need.",
    "She was quite gracious about it.",
    "Its\nnot anywhere in that tinpot bungalow.",
    "After the inquest was\nadjourned we made a show of letting up on Miss Cray and Miss\nSavernake and weve had a tail on them to see where they went and\nwhat theyd do.",
    "Weve had a man on at the film studios watching\nVeronica  no sign of her trying to ditch the gun there.",
    "And Henrietta Savernake\n\nNothing there either.",
    "She went straight back to Chelsea and weve\nkept an eye on her ever since.",
    "The revolver isnt in her studio or in her\npossession.",
    "She was quite pleasant about the search  seemed\namused.",
    "Some of her fancy stuff gave our man quite a turn.",
    "He said it\nbeat him why people wanted to do that kind of thing  statues all lumps\nand swellings bits of brass and aluminum twisted into fancy shapes\nhorses that you wouldnt know were horses \n\n\fPoirot stirred a little.",
    "Horses you say\n\nWell a horse.",
    "If youd call it a horse If people want to model a horse\nwhy dont they go and look at a horse\n\nA horse repeated Poirot.",
    "Grange turned his head.",
    "What is there about that that interests you so M. Poirot I dont get\nit.",
    "Association  a point of the psychology.",
    "Word association Horse and cart.",
    "Rocking horse Clotheshorse.",
    "No I dont get it.",
    "Anyway after a day or two Miss Savernake packs up\nand comes down here again.",
    "You know that\n\nYes I have talked with her and I have seen her walking in the woods.",
    "Restless yes.",
    "Well she was having an affair with the doctor all right\nand his saying Henrietta as he died is pretty near to an accusation.",
    "But its not quite near enough M. Poirot.",
    "No said Poirot thoughtfully it is not near enough.",
    "Grange said heavily\n\n\fTheres something in the atmosphere here  It gets you all tangled up\nIts as though they all knew something.",
    "Lady Angkatell now  shes\nnever been able to put out a decent reason why she took out a gun\nwith her that day.",
    "Its a crazy thing to do  sometimes I think she is\ncrazy.",
    "Poirot shook his head very gently.",
    "No he said she is not crazy.",
    "Then theres Edward Angkatell.",
    "I thought I was getting something on\nhim.",
    "Lady Angkatell said  no hinted  that hed been in love with Miss\nSavernake for years.",
    "Well that gives him a motive.",
    "And now I find its\nthe other girl  Miss Hardcastle  that hes engaged to.",
    "So bang goes\nthe case against him.",
    "Poirot gave a sympathetic murmur.",
    "Then theres the young fellow pursued the Inspector.",
    "Lady\nAngkatell let slip something about him  his mother it seems died in an\nasylum  persecution mania  thought everybody was conspiring to kill\nher.",
    "Well you can see what that might mean.",
    "If the boy had inherited\nthat particular strain of insanity he might have got ideas into his head\nabout Dr. Christow  might have fancied the doctor was planning to\ncertify him.",
    "Not that Christow was that kind of doctor.",
    "Nervous\naffections of the alimentary canal and diseases of the SuperSupersomething  that was Christows line.",
    "But if the boy was a bit touched\nhe might imagine Christow was here to keep him under observation.",
    "Hes got an extraordinary manner that young fellow nervous as a\ncat.",
    "Grange sat unhappily for a moment or two.",
    "You see what I mean All vague suspicions  leading nowhere.",
    "Poirot stirred again.",
    "He murmured softly\n\nAway  not towards.",
    "From not to.",
    "Nowhere instead of somewhere...",
    "Yes of course that must be it.",
    "Grange stared at him.",
    "He said\n\nTheyre queer all these Angkatells.",
    "Id swear sometimes that they\nknow all about it.",
    "Poirot said quietly\n\nThey do.",
    "You mean they know all of them who did it the Inspector asked\nincredulously.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Yes  they know.",
    "I have thought so for some time.",
    "I am quite sure\nnow.",
    "I see.",
    "The Inspectors face was grim.",
    "And theyre hiding it up among\nthem Well Ill beat them yet.",
    "Im going to find that gun.",
    "It was Poirot reflected quite the Inspectors theme song.",
    "Grange went on with rancour\n\nId give anything to get even with them \n\nWith \n\nAll of them Muddling me up Suggesting things Hinting Helping my\nmen  helping them All gossamer and spiders webs nothing tangible.",
    "What I want is a good solid fact\n\nHercule Poirot had been staring out of the window for some moment...\nHis eye had been attracted by an irregularity in the symmetry of his\ndomain.",
    "He said now\n\nYou want a solid fact Eh bien unless I am much mistaken there is a\nsolid fact in the hedge by my gate.",
    "They went down the garden path.",
    "Grange went down on his knees\ncoaxed the twigs apart till he disclosed more fully the thing that had\nbeen thrust between them.",
    "He drew a deep sigh as something black\nand steel was revealed.",
    "He said Its a revolver all right.",
    "Just for a moment his eye rested doubtfully on Poirot.",
    "No no my\nfriend said Poirot.",
    "I did not shoot Dr. Christow and I did not put the\nrevolver in my own hedge.",
    "Of course you didnt M. Poirot Sorry Well weve got it.",
    "Looks like\nthe one missing from Sir Henrys study.",
    "We can verify that as soon as\nwe get the number.",
    "Then well see if it was the gun that shot Christow.",
    "Easy does it now.",
    "With infinite care and the use of a silk handkerchief he eased the gun\nout of the hedge.",
    "To give us a break we want fingerprints.",
    "Ive a feeling you know that\nour lucks changed at last.",
    "Let me know \n\nOf course I will M. Poirot.",
    "Ill ring you up.",
    "Poirot received two telephone calls.",
    "The first came through that same\nevening.",
    "The Inspector was jubilant.",
    "That you M. Poirot Well heres the dope.",
    "Its the gun all right.",
    "The\ngun missing from Sir Henrys collection and the gun that shot John\nChristow Thats definite.",
    "And there is a good set of prints on it.",
    "Thumb first finger part of the middle finger.",
    "Didnt I tell you our luck\nhad changed\n\nYou have identified the fingerprints\n\n\fNot yet.",
    "Theyre certainly not Mrs. Christows.",
    "We took hers.",
    "They\nlook more like a mans than a womans for size.",
    "Tomorrow Im going\nalong to The Hollow to speak my little piece and get a sample from\neveryone.",
    "And then M. Poirot we shall know where we are\n\nI hope so I am sure said Poirot politely.",
    "The second telephone call came through on the following day and the\nvoice that spoke was no longer jubilant.",
    "In tones of unmitigated gloom\nGrange said\n\nWant to hear the latest Those fingerprints arent the prints of\nanybody connected with the case No sir Theyre not Edward\nAngkatells nor Davids nor Sir Henrys.",
    "Theyre not Gerda Christows\nnor the Savernakes nor our Veronicas nor her ladyships nor the\nlittle dark girls Theyre not even the kitchenmaids  let alone any of\nthe other servants\n\nPoirot made condoling noises.",
    "The sad voice of Inspector Grange went\non\n\nSo it looks as though after all it was an outside job.",
    "Someone that is\nto say who had a down on Dr. Christow and who we dont know\nanything about Someone invisible and inaudible who pinched the guns\nfrom the study and who went away after the shooting by the path to\nthe lane.",
    "Someone who put the gun in your hedge and then vanished\ninto thin air\n\nWould you like my fingerprints my friend\n\n\fI dont mind if I do It strikes me M Poirot that you were on the spot\nand that taking it all round youre far and away the most suspicious\ncharacter in the case\n\nChapter 27\n\nThe coroner cleared his throat and looked expectantly at the foreman\nof the jury.",
    "The latter looked down at the piece of paper he held in his hand.",
    "His\nAdams apple wagged up and down excitedly.",
    "He read out in a careful\nvoice\n\nWe find that the deceased came to his death by wilful murder by some\nperson or persons unknown.",
    "Poirot nodded his head quietly in his corner by the wall.",
    "There could be no other possible verdict.",
    "Outside the Angkatells stopped a moment to speak to Gerda and her\nsister.",
    "Gerda was wearing the same black clothes as before.",
    "Her face\nhad the same dazed unhappy expression.",
    "This time there was no\nDaimler.",
    "The train service Elsie Patterson explained was really very\ngood.",
    "A fast train to Waterloo and they could easily catch the 120 to\nBexhill.",
    "Lady Angkatell clasping Gerdas hand murmured\n\n\fYou must keep in touch with us my dear.",
    "A little lunch perhaps one\nday in London I expect youll come up to do shopping occasionally\n\nI  I dont know said Gerda.",
    "Elsie Patterson said\n\nWe must hurry dear our train and Gerda turned away with an\nexpression of relief.",
    "Midge said\n\nPoor Gerda.",
    "The only thing Johns death has done for her is to set her\nfree from your terrifying hospitality Lucy.",
    "How unkind you are Midge.",
    "Nobody could say I didnt try.",
    "You are much worse when you try Lucy.",
    "Well its very nice to think its all over isnt it said Lady Angkatell\nbeaming at them.",
    "Except of course for poor Inspector Grange.",
    "I do\nfeel so sorry for him.",
    "Would it cheer him up do you think if we asked\nhim back to lunch As a friend I mean.",
    "I should let well alone Lucy said Sir Henry.",
    "Perhaps you are right said Lady Angkatell meditatively And\nanyway it isnt the right kind of lunch today.",
    "Partridges au Choux  and\nthat delicious souffle surprise that Mrs. Medway makes so well.",
    "Not at\n\n\fall Inspector Granges kind of lunch.",
    "A really good steak a little\nunderdone and a good oldfashioned apple tart with no nonsense\nabout it  or perhaps apple dumplings  thats what I should order for\nInspector Grange.",
    "Your instincts about food are always very sound Lucy.",
    "I think we had\nbetter get home to those partridges  they sound delicious.",
    "Well I thought we ought to have some celebration Its wonderful\nisnt it how everything always seems to turn out for the best\n\nYees \n\nI know what youre thinking Henry but dont worry.",
    "I shall attend to it\nthis afternoon.",
    "What are you up to now Lucy\n\nLady Angkatell smiled at him.",
    "Its quite all right darling.",
    "Just tucking in a loose end.",
    "Sir Henry looked at her doubtfully.",
    "When they reached The Hollow Gudgeon came out to open the door of\nthe car.",
    "Everything went off very satisfactorily Gudgeon said Lady\nAngkatell.",
    "Please tell Mrs. Medway and the others.",
    "I know how\n\n\funpleasant it has been for you all and I should like to tell you now how\nmuch Sir Henry and I have appreciated the loyalty you have all shown.",
    "We have been deeply concerned for you mlady said Gudgeon.",
    "Very sweet of Gudgeon said Lucy as she went into the drawingroom but really quite wasted.",
    "I have really almost enjoyed it all  so\ndifferent you know from what one is accustomed to.",
    "Dont you feel\nDavid that an experience like this has broadened your mind It must\nbe so different from Cambridge.",
    "I am at Oxford.",
    "said David coldly.",
    "Lady Angkatell said vaguely The dear boat race.",
    "So English dont\nyou think and went towards the telephone.",
    "She picked up the receiver and holding it in her hand she went on\n\nI do hope David that you will come and stay with us again.",
    "Its so\ndifficult isnt it to get to know people when there is a murder And\nquite impossible to have any really intellectual conversation.",
    "Thank you said David.",
    "But when I come down I am going to Athens to the British School.",
    "Lady Angkatell turned to her husband.",
    "Whos got the Embassy now Oh of course  HopeRemmington.",
    "No I\ndont think David would like them.",
    "Those girls of theirs are so terribly\n\n\fhearty.",
    "They play hockey and cricket and the funny game where you\ncatch the thing in a net.",
    "She broke off looking down at the telephone receiver.",
    "Now what am I doing with this thing\n\nPerhaps you were going to ring someone up said Edward.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "She replaced it.",
    "Do you like telephones David\n\nIt was the sort of question David reflected irritably that she would\nask one to which there could be no intelligent answer.",
    "He replied\ncoldly that he supposed they were useful.",
    "You mean said Lady\nAngkatell like mincing machines Or elastic bands All the same one\nwouldnt \n\nShe broke off as Gudgeon appeared in the doorway to announce\nlunch.",
    "But you like partridges said Lady Angkatell to David anxiously.",
    "David admitted that he liked partridges.",
    "Sometimes I think Lucy really is a bit touched said Midge as she\nand Edward strolled over from the house and up towards the woods.",
    "The partridges and the souffle surprise had been excellent and with\nthe inquest over a weight had lifted from the atmosphere.",
    "Edward said thoughtfully\n\nI always think Lucy has a brilliant mind that expresses itself like a\nmissing word competition.",
    "To mix metaphors  the hammer jumps from\nnail to nail and never fails to hit each one squarely on the head.",
    "All the same Midge said soberly Lucy frightens me sometimes.",
    "She added with a tiny shiver.",
    "This place has frightened me lately.",
    "The Hollow\n\nEdward turned an astonished face to her.",
    "It always reminds me a little of Ainswick he said.",
    "Its not of course\nthe real thing \n\nMidge interrupted\n\nThats just it Edward  Im frightened of things that arent the real\nthing... You dont know you see whats behind them... Its like  oh its\nlike a mask.",
    "You mustnt be fanciful little Midge.",
    "It was the old tone the indulgent tone he had used years ago.",
    "She had\nliked it then but now it disturbed her.",
    "She struggled to make her\nmeaning clearer  to show him that behind what he called fancy was\nsome shape of dimly apprehended reality.",
    "I got away from it in London but now I get back here it all comes over\nme again.",
    "I feel that everyone knows who killed John Christow... That\nthe only person who doesnt know  is me.",
    "Edward said irritably\n\nMust we think and talk about John Christow Hes dead.",
    "Dead and\ngone.",
    "Midge murmured\n\nHe is dead and gone lady\n\nHe is dead and gone\n\nAt his head a grassgreen turf\n\nAt his heels a stone.",
    "She put her hand on Edwards arm.",
    "Who did kill him Edward We\nthought it was Gerda  but it wasnt Gerda.",
    "Then who was it Tell me\nwhat you think Was it someone weve never heard of\n\nHe said irritably\n\nAll this speculation seems to me quite unprofitable.",
    "If the police cant\nfind out or cant get sufficient evidence then the whole thing will have\nto be allowed to drop  and we shall be rid of it.",
    "Yes  but its the not knowing \n\nWhy should we want to know What has John Christow to do with\nus\n\nWith us she thought with Edward and me Nothing Comforting\nthought  she and Edward linked a dual entity.",
    "And yet  and yet  John\nChristow for all that he had been laid in his grave and the words of the\nburial service read over him was not buried deep enough.",
    "He is dead\nand gone lady...",
    "But John Christow was not dead and gone  for all\nthat Edward wished him to be... John Christow was still here at The\nHollow.",
    "Edward said Where are we going\n\nSomething in his tone surprised her.",
    "She said Lets walk up onto the\ntop of the ridge.",
    "Shall we\n\nIf you like.",
    "For some reason he was unwilling.",
    "She wondered why.",
    "It was usually\nhis favourite walk.",
    "He and Henrietta used nearly always  Her thought\nsnapped and broke off...",
    "He and Henrietta  She said Have you been\nthis way yet this Autumn\n\nHe said stiffly\n\nHenrietta and I walked up here that first afternoon.",
    "They went on in silence.",
    "They came at last to the top and sat on the fallen tree.",
    "Midge thought He and Henrietta sat here perhaps...\n\nShe turned the ring on her finger round and round.",
    "The diamond\nflashed coldly at her... Not emeralds he had said.",
    "She said with a slight effort\n\nIt will be lovely to be at Ainswick again for Christmas.",
    "He did not seem to hear her.",
    "He had gone far away.",
    "She thought He is thinking of Henrietta and of John Christow.",
    "Sitting here he had said something to Henrietta or she had said\nsomething to him... Henrietta might know what she didnt want but he\nbelonged to Henrietta still.",
    "He always would Midge thought belong to\nHenrietta...",
    "Pain swooped down upon her.",
    "The happy bubble world in which she\nhad lived for the last week quivered and broke.",
    "She thought I cant live like that  with Henrietta always there in his\nmind.",
    "I cant face it.",
    "I cant bear it...",
    "The wind sighed through the trees  the leaves were falling fast now there were hardly any gold ones left only brown.",
    "She said Edward\n\nThe urgency of her voice aroused him.",
    "He turned his head.",
    "Im sorry Edward.",
    "Her lips were trembling but she forced her voice\nto be quiet and selfcontrolled.",
    "Ive got to tell you.",
    "Its no use.",
    "I cant\nmarry you.",
    "It wouldnt work Edward.",
    "He said But Midge  surely Ainswick \n\nShe interrupted\n\nI cant marry you just for Ainswick Edward.",
    "You  you must see that.",
    "He sighed then a long gentle sigh.",
    "It was like an echo of the dead\nleaves slipping gently off the branches of the trees.",
    "I see what you mean he said.",
    "Yes I suppose you are right.",
    "It was dear of you to ask me dear and sweet.",
    "But it wouldnt do\nEdward.",
    "It wouldnt work.",
    "She had had a faint hope perhaps that he would argue with her that\nhe would try to persuade her  but he seemed quite simply to feel just\nas she did about it.",
    "Here with the ghost of Henrietta close beside him\nhe too apparently saw that it couldnt work...\n\nNo he said echoing her words it wouldnt work.",
    "She slipped the ring off her finger and held it out to him.",
    "She would always love Edward and Edward would always love\nHenrietta and life was just plain unadulterated hell...\n\nShe said with a little catch in her voice\n\nIts a lovely ring Edward.",
    "I wish youd keep it Midge.",
    "Id like you to have it.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "I couldnt do that.",
    "He said with a faint humorous twist of the lips\n\nI shant give it to anyone else you know.",
    "It was all quite friendly.",
    "He didnt know  he would never know  just\nwhat she was feeling...",
    "Heaven on a plate  and the plate was broken\nand Heaven had slipped between her fingers or had perhaps never\nbeen there.",
    "That afternoon Poirot received his third visitor.",
    "He had been visited by Henrietta Savernake and by Veronica Cray.",
    "This time it was Lady Angkatell.",
    "She came floating up the path with her\nusual appearance of insubstantiality.",
    "He opened the door and she stood smiling at him.",
    "I have come to see you she announced.",
    "So might a fairy confer a favour on a mere mortal.",
    "I am enchanted Madame.",
    "He led the way into the sitting room.",
    "She sat down on the sofa and\nonce more she smiled.",
    "Hercule Poirot thought She is old  her hair is grey  there are lines in\nher face.",
    "Yet she has magic  she will always have magic...\n\nLady Angkatell said softly\n\nI want you to do something for me.",
    "Yes Madame\n\nTo begin with I must talk to you  about John Christow.",
    "About Dr. Christow\n\nYes.",
    "It seems to me that the only thing to do is to put a full stop to the\nwhole thing.",
    "You understand what I mean dont you\n\nI am not sure that I do know what you mean Lady Angkatell.",
    "She gave him her lovely dazzling smile again and she put one long\nwhite hand on his sleeve.",
    "Dear M. Poirot you know perfectly.",
    "The police will have to hunt about\nfor the owner of those fingerprints and they wont find him and in the\nend theyll have to let the whole thing drop.",
    "But Im afraid you know\nthat you wont let it drop.",
    "No I shall not let it drop said Hercule Poirot.",
    "That is just what I thought... And that is why I came.",
    "Its the truth you\nwant isnt it\n\nCertainly I want the truth.",
    "I see I havent explained myself very well.",
    "Im trying to find out just\nwhy you wont let things drop.",
    "It isnt because of your prestige  or\nbecause you want to hang a murderer such an unpleasant kind of\ndeath Ive always thought  so medieval.",
    "Its just I think that you want\nto know.",
    "You do see what I mean dont you If you were to know the\ntruth  if you were to be told the truth I think  I think perhaps that\nmight satisfy you Would it satisfy you M. Poirot\n\nYou are offering to tell me the truth Lady Angkatell\n\nShe nodded.",
    "You yourself know the truth then\n\nHer eyes opened very wide.",
    "Oh yes Ive known for a long time.",
    "Id like to tell you.",
    "And then we\ncould agree that  well that it was all over and done with.",
    "She smiled at him.",
    "Is it a bargain M. Poirot\n\nIt was quite an effort for Hercule Poirot to say\n\nNo Madame it is not a bargain.",
    "He wanted  he wanted very badly to let the whole thing drop... simply\nbecause Lucy Angkatell asked him to do so.",
    "Lady Angkatell sat very still for a moment.",
    "Then she raised her\neyebrows.",
    "I wonder she said...",
    "I wonder if you really know what you are\ndoing\n\nChapter 28\n\nMidge lying dry eyed and awake in the darkness turned restlessly on\nher pillows.",
    "She heard a door unlatch a footstep in the corridor outside passing\nher door...",
    "It was Edwards door and Edwards step...\n\nShe switched on the lamp by her bed and looked at the clock that\nstood by the lamp on the table.",
    "It was ten minutes to three.",
    "Edward passing her door and going down the stairs at this hour in the\nmorning.",
    "It was odd.",
    "They had all gone to bed early at half past ten.",
    "She herself had not\nslept had lain there with burning eyelids and with a dry aching misery\nracking her feverishly.",
    "She had heard the clock strike downstairs  had heard owls hoot\noutside her bedroom window.",
    "Had felt that depression that reaches its\nnadir at 200 a.m. Had thought to herself I cant bear it  I cant bear\nit.",
    "Tomorrow coming  another day... Day after day to be got through.",
    "Banished by her own act from Ainswick  from all the loveliness and\ndearness of Ainswick which might have been her very own possession.",
    "But better banishment better\n\nloneliness better a drab and\n\nuninteresting life than life with Edward and Henriettas ghost.",
    "Until\nthat day in the wood she had not known her own capacity for bitter\njealousy.",
    "And after all Edward had never told her that he loved her.",
    "Affection\nkindliness he had never pretended to more than that.",
    "She had\n\n\faccepted the limitation and not until she had realized what it would\nmean to live at close quarters with an Edward whose mind and heart\nhad Henrietta as a permanent guest did she know that for her\nEdwards affection was not enough.",
    "Edward walking past her door down the front stairs...",
    "It was odd  very odd  where was he going\n\nUneasiness grew upon her.",
    "It was all part and parcel of the uneasiness\nthat The Hollow gave her nowadays.",
    "What was Edward doing\ndownstairs in the small hours of the morning Had he gone out\n\nInactivity at last became too much for her.",
    "She got up slipped on her\ndressing gown and taking a flashlight she opened her door and came\nout into the passage.",
    "It was quite dark no lights had been switched on.",
    "Midge turned to the\nleft and came to the head of the staircase.",
    "Below all was dark too.",
    "She\nran down the stairs and after a moments hesitation switched on the\nlight in the hall.",
    "Everything was silent.",
    "The front door was closed and\nlocked.",
    "She tried the side door but that too was locked.",
    "Edward then had not gone out.",
    "Where could he be\n\nAnd suddenly she raised her head and sniffed.",
    "A whiff  a very faint whiff of gas.",
    "The baize door to the kitchen quarters was just ajar.",
    "She went through\nit  a faint light was shining from the open kitchen door.",
    "The smell of\ngas was much stronger.",
    "Midge ran along the passage and into the kitchen.",
    "Edward was lying\non the floor with his head inside the gas oven which was turned on full.",
    "Midge was a quick practical girl.",
    "Her first act was to swing open the\nshutters.",
    "She could not unlatch the window and winding a glass cloth\nround her arm she smashed it.",
    "Then holding her breath she stooped\ndown and tugged and pulled Edward out of the gas oven and switched\noff the taps.",
    "He was unconscious and breathing queerly but she knew that he\ncould not have been unconscious long.",
    "He could only just have gone\nunder.",
    "The wind sweeping through from the window to the open door\nwas fast dispelling the gas fumes.",
    "Midge dragged Edward to a spot\nnear the window where the air would have full play.",
    "She sat down and\ngathered him into her strong young arms.",
    "She said his name first softly then with increasing desperation\n\nEdward Edward Edward Edward...",
    "He stirred groaned opened his eyes and looked up at her.",
    "He said very faintly Gas oven... and his eyes went round to the gas\nstove.",
    "I know darling but why  why\n\n\fHe was shivering now his hands were cold and lifeless.",
    "He said Midge\n\nThere was a kind of wondering surprise and pleasure in his voice.",
    "She said I heard you pass my door...",
    "I didnt know...",
    "I came down.",
    "He sighed  a very long sigh as though from very far away.",
    "Best way out he said.",
    "And then inexplicably until she remembered\nLucys conversation on the night of the tragedy News of the World.",
    "But Edward why  why\n\nHe looked up at her and the blank cold darkness of his stare\nfrightened her.",
    "Because I know now Ive never been any good.",
    "Always a failure.",
    "Always ineffectual.",
    "Its men like Christow who do things.",
    "They get\nthere and women admire them.",
    "Im nothing  Im not even quite alive.",
    "I\ninherited Ainswick and Ive enough to live on  otherwise Id have gone\nunder.",
    "No good at a career  never much good as a writer.",
    "Henrietta\ndidnt want me.",
    "No one wanted me.",
    "That day  at the Berkeley  I\nthought  but it was the same story.",
    "You couldnt care either Midge.",
    "Even for Ainswick you couldnt put up with me...",
    "So I thought better get\nout altogether.",
    "Her words came with a rush.",
    "Darling darling.",
    "You dont understand.",
    "It was because of Henrietta because I thought you still loved Henrietta so much.",
    "Henrietta He murmured it vaguely as though speaking of someone\ninfinitely remote.",
    "Yes I loved her very much.",
    "And from even farther away she heard him murmur\n\nIts so cold...\n\nEdward  my darling.",
    "Her arms closed round him firmly.",
    "He smiled at her murmuring\n\nYoure so warm Midge  youre so warm.",
    "Yes she thought that was what despair was.",
    "A cold thing  a thing of\ninfinite coldness and loneliness.",
    "Shed never understood until now that\ndespair was a cold thing.",
    "She had thought of it as something hot and\npassionate something violent a hotblooded desperation.",
    "But that\nwas not so.",
    "This was despair  this utter outer darkness of coldness\nand loneliness.",
    "And the sin of despair that priests talked of was a\ncold sin the sin of cutting oneself off from all warm and living human\ncontacts...\n\nEdward said again Youre so warm.",
    "Midge.",
    "And suddenly with a\nglad proud confidence she thought.",
    "But thats what he wants  thats\nwhat I can give him They were all cold the Angkatells even Henrietta\nhad something in her of the willothewisp of the elusive fairy\n\n\fcoldness in the Angkatell blood.",
    "Let Edward love Henrietta as an\nintangible and unpossessable dream.",
    "It was warmth permanence\nstability that was his real need.",
    "It was daily companionship and love\nand laughter at Ainswick.",
    "She thought What Edward needs is someone to light a fire on his\nhearth  and I am the person to do that.",
    "Edward looked up.",
    "He saw Midges face bending over him the warm\ncolouring of the skin the generous mouth the steady eyes and the\ndark hair that lay back from her forehead like two wings.",
    "He saw Henrietta always as a projection from the past.",
    "In the grown\nwoman he sought and wanted only to see the seventeenyearold girl\nhe had first loved.",
    "But now looking up at Midge he had a queer sense\nof seeing a continuous Midge  he saw the schoolgirl with her winged\nhair springing back into two pigtails he saw its dark waves framing\nher face now and he saw exactly how those wings would look when the\nhair was not dark any longer but grey...\n\nMidge he thought is real... the only real thing I have ever known...",
    "He\nfelt the warmth of her and the strength  dark positive alive real\nMidge he thought is the rock on which I can build my life...",
    "He said Darling Midge I love you so never leave me again...\n\nShe bent down to him and he felt the warmth of her lips on his felt her\nlove enveloping him shielding him and happiness flowered in that\ncold desert where he had lived alone so long...",
    "Suddenly Midge said with a shaky laugh \n\nLook Edward a black beetle has come out to look at us.",
    "Isnt he a\nnice black beetle I never thought I could like a black beetle so much\nShe added dreamily\n\nHow odd life is.",
    "Here we are sitting on the floor in a kitchen that still\nsmells of gas all amongst the black beetles and feeling that its\nheaven.",
    "He murmured dreamily\n\nI could stay here forever.",
    "Wed better go and get some sleep.",
    "Its four oclock.",
    "How on earth are\nwe to explain that broken window to Lucy\n\nFortunately Midge reflected Lucy was an extraordinarily easy person\nto explain things to...",
    "Taking a leaf out of Lucys own book Midge went into her room at six\noclock.",
    "She made a bald statement of fact.",
    "Edward went down and put his head in the gas oven in the night she\nsaid.",
    "Fortunately I heard him and went down after him.",
    "I broke the\nwindow because I couldnt get it open quickly.",
    "Lucy Midge had to admit was wonderful.",
    "She smiled sweetly with no sign of surprise.",
    "Dear Midge she said you are always so practical.",
    "Im sure you will\nalways be the greatest comfort to Edward.",
    "After Midge had gone Lady Angkatell lay thinking.",
    "Then she got up and\nwent into her husbands room which for once was unlocked.",
    "Henry.",
    "My dear Lucy Its not cockcrow yet.",
    "No but listen Henry this is really important.",
    "We must have electricity\ninstalled to cook by and get rid of that gas stove.",
    "Why its quite satisfactory isnt it\n\nOh yes dear.",
    "But its the sort of thing that gives people ideas and\neverybody mightnt be as practical as dear Midge.",
    "She flitted elusively away.",
    "Sir Henry turned over with a grunt.",
    "Presently he awoke with a start just as he was dozing off.",
    "Did I dream it he murmured or did Lucy come in and start talking\nabout gas stoves\n\nOutside in the passage Lady Angkatell went into the bathroom and put\na kettle on the gas ring.",
    "Sometimes she knew people liked an early\n\n\fcup of tea...",
    "Fired with selfapproval she returned to bed and lay back\non her pillows pleased with life and with herself.",
    "Edward and Midge at Ainswick  the inquest over  She would go and\ntalk to M. Poirot again.",
    "A nice little man...",
    "Suddenly another idea flashed into her head.",
    "She sat upright in bed.",
    "I wonder now she speculated if she has thought of that\n\nShe got out of bed and drifted along the passage to Henriettas room\nbeginning her remarks as usual long before she was within earshot.",
    "and it suddenly came home dear that you might have overlooked\nthat.",
    "Henrietta murmured sleepily\n\nFor heavens sake Lucy the birds arent up yet\n\nOh I know dear it is rather early but it seems to have been a very\ndisturbed night  Edward and the gas stove and Midge and the kitchen\nwindow  and thinking of what to say to M. Poirot and everything \n\nIm sorry Lucy but everything you say sounds like complete\ngibberish... Cant it wait\n\nIt was only the holster dear.",
    "I thought you know that you might not\nhave thought about the holster.",
    "Holster Henrietta sat up in bed.",
    "She was suddenly wide awake.",
    "Whats this about a holster\n\nThat revolver of Henrys was in a holster you know.",
    "And the holster\nhasnt been found.",
    "And of course nobody may think of it  but on the\nother hand somebody might \n\nHenrietta swung herself out of bed.",
    "She said\n\nOne always forgets something  thats what they say And its true\n\nLady Angkatell went back to her room.",
    "She got into bed and quickly went fast asleep.",
    "The kettle on the gas ring boiled and went on boiling...\n\nChapter 29\n\nGerda rolled over to the side of the bed and sat up.",
    "Her head felt a little better now but she was still glad that she hadnt\ngone with the others on the picnic.",
    "It was peaceful and almost\ncomforting to be alone in the house for a bit.",
    "Elsie of course had been very kind  very kind  especially at first.",
    "To\nbegin with Gerda had been urged to stay in bed for breakfast trays\nhad been brought up to her.",
    "Everybody urged her to sit in the most\n\n\fcomfortable armchair to put her feet up not to do anything at all\nstrenuous.",
    "They were all so sorry for her about John.",
    "She had stayed cowering\ngratefully in that protective dim haze.",
    "She hadnt wanted to think or to\nfeel or to remember.",
    "But now every day she felt it coming nearer  shed have to start living\nagain to decide what to do where to live.",
    "Already Elsie was showing a\nshade of impatience in her manner.",
    "Oh Gerda dont be so slow\n\nIt was all the same as it had been  long ago before John came and\ntook her away.",
    "They all thought her slow and stupid.",
    "There was\nnobody to say as John had said Ill look after you.",
    "Her head ached and Gerda thought Ill make myself some tea.",
    "She went down to the kitchen and put the kettle on.",
    "It was nearly\nboiling when she heard a ring at the front door.",
    "The maids had been given the day out.",
    "Gerda went to the door and\nopened it.",
    "She was astonished to see Henriettas rakishlooking car\ndrawn up to the curb and Henrietta herself standing on the doorstep.",
    "Why Henrietta she exclaimed.",
    "She fell back a step or two.",
    "Come\nin.",
    "Im afraid my sister and the children are out but \n\nHenrietta cut her short.",
    "Good.",
    "Im glad.",
    "I wanted to get you alone.",
    "Listen Gerda what did you\ndo with the holster\n\nGerda\n\nstopped.",
    "Her\n\neyes\n\nlooked\n\nsuddenly\n\nvacant\n\nand\n\nuncomprehending.",
    "She said Holster\n\nThen she opened a door on the right of the hall.",
    "Youd better come in here.",
    "Im afraid its rather dusty.",
    "You see we\nhavent had much time this morning \n\nHenrietta interrupted again urgently.",
    "She said Listen Gerda youve got to tell me.",
    "Apart from the holster\neverythings all right  absolutely watertight.",
    "Theres nothing to\nconnect you with the business.",
    "I found the revolver where youd\nshoved it into that thicket by the pool.",
    "I hid it in a place where you\ncouldnt possibly have put it  and there are fingerprints on it which\ntheyll never identify.",
    "So theres only the holster I must know what you\ndid with that\n\nShe paused praying desperately that Gerda would react quickly.",
    "She had no idea why she had this vital sense of urgency but it was\nthere.",
    "Her car had not been followed  she had made sure of that.",
    "She\nhad started on the London road had filled up at a garage and had\nmentioned that she was on her way to London.",
    "Then a little further on\nshe had swung across country until she had reached a main road\nleading south to the coast.",
    "Gerda was still staring at her.",
    "The trouble with Gerda thought\nHenrietta was that she was so slow.",
    "If youve still got it Gerda you must give it to me.",
    "Ill get rid of it\nsomehow.",
    "Its the only possible thing you see that can connect you\nnow with Johns death.",
    "Have you got it\n\nThere was a pause and then Gerda slowly nodded her head.",
    "Didnt you know it was madness to keep it Henrietta could hardly\ncontrol her impatience.",
    "I forgot about it.",
    "It was up in my room.",
    "She added When the police came up to Harley Street I cut it in two\nand put it in the bag with my leather work.",
    "Henrietta said That was clever of you.",
    "Gerda said Im not quite so stupid as everybody thinks.",
    "She put her hand up to her throat.",
    "She said John  John  Her voice\nbroke.",
    "Henrietta said I know my dear I know.",
    "Gerda said But you cant know... John wasnt  he wasnt  She stood\nthere dumb and strangely pathetic.",
    "She raised her eyes suddenly to Henriettas face.",
    "It was all a lie everything All the things I thought he was I saw his face when he\nfollowed that woman out that evening.",
    "Veronica Cray I knew hed\ncared for her of course years ago before he married me but I\nthought it was all over.",
    "Henrietta said gently\n\nBut it was all over.",
    "Gerda shook her head.",
    "No.",
    "She came there and pretended that she hadnt seen John for\nyears  but I saw Johns face...",
    "He went out with her.",
    "I went up to bed.",
    "I\nlay there trying to read  I tried to read that detective story that John\nwas reading.",
    "And John didnt come.",
    "And at last I went out...",
    "Her eyes seemed to be turning inwards seeing the scene.",
    "It was moonlight.",
    "I went along the path to the swimming pool.",
    "There\nwas a light in the pavilion.",
    "They were there  John and that woman...\n\nHenrietta made a faint sound.",
    "Gerdas face had changed  it had none of its usual slightly vacant\namiability.",
    "It was remorseless implacable.",
    "Id trusted John.",
    "Id believed in him  as though he were God.",
    "I thought\nhe was the noblest man in the world  I thought he was everything that\n\n\fwas fine and noble... And it was all a lie I was left with nothing nothing at all.",
    "I  Id worshipped John\n\nHenrietta was gazing at her fascinated.",
    "For here before her eyes was\nwhat she had guessed at and brought to life carving it out of wood.",
    "Here was The Worshipper  blind devotion thrown back on itself\ndisillusioned  dangerous...\n\nGerda said I couldnt bear it I had to kill him I had to  you do see\nthat Henrietta\n\nShe said it quite conversationally in an almost friendly tone.",
    "And I knew I must be careful because the police are very clever.",
    "But\nthen Im not really as stupid as people think If youre very slow and\njust stare people think you dont take things in  and sometimes\nunderneath youre laughing at them I knew I could kill John and\nnobody would know because Id read in that detective story about the\npolice being able to tell which gun a bullet has been fired from.",
    "Sir\nHenry had shown me how to load and fire a revolver that afternoon.",
    "Id\ntake two revolvers.",
    "Id shoot John with one and then hide it and let\npeople find me holding the other and first theyd think Id shot him and\nthen theyd find he couldnt have been killed with that revolver and so\ntheyd say I hadnt done it after all\n\nShe nodded her head triumphantly.",
    "But I forgot about the leather thing.",
    "It was in the drawer in my\nbedroom.",
    "What do you call it a holster Surely the police wont bother\nabout that now\n\n\fThey might said Henrietta.",
    "Youd better give it to me and Ill take it\naway with me.",
    "Once its out of your hands youre quite safe.",
    "She sat down.",
    "She felt suddenly unutterably weary.",
    "Gerda said You dont look well.",
    "I was just making tea.",
    "She went out of the room.",
    "Presently she came back with a tray.",
    "On it\nwas a teapot milk jug and two cups.",
    "The milk jug had slopped over\nbecause it was overfull.",
    "Gerda put the tray down and poured out a cup\nof tea and handed it to Henrietta.",
    "Oh dear she said dismayed I dont believe the kettle can have\nbeen boiling.",
    "Its quite all right said Henrietta.",
    "Go and get that holster Gerda.",
    "Gerda hesitated and then went out of the room.",
    "Henrietta leant\nforward and put her arms on the table and her head down on them.",
    "She was so tired so dreadfully tired...",
    "But it was nearly done now.",
    "Gerda would be safe... as John had wanted her to be safe.",
    "She sat up pushed the hair off her forehead and drew the teacup\ntowards her.",
    "Then at a sound in the doorway she looked up.",
    "Gerda had\nbeen quite quick for once.",
    "But it was Hercule Poirot who stood in the doorway.",
    "The front door was open he remarked as he advanced to the table\nso I took the liberty of walking in.",
    "You said Henrietta.",
    "How did you get here\n\nWhen you left The Hollow so suddenly naturally I knew where you\nwould go.",
    "I hired a very fast car and came straight here.",
    "I see.",
    "Henrietta sighed.",
    "You would.",
    "You should not drink that tea said Poirot taking the cup from her\nand replacing it on the tray.",
    "Tea that has not been made with boiling\nwater is not good to drink.",
    "Does a little thing like boiling water really matter\n\nPoirot said gently Everything matters.",
    "There was a sound behind him and Gerda came into the room.",
    "She had\na workbag in her hands.",
    "Her eyes went from Poirots face to\nHenriettas.",
    "Henrietta said quickly\n\nIm afraid Gerda Im rather a suspicious character.",
    "M. Poirot seems\nto have been shadowing me.",
    "He thinks that I killed John  but he cant\nprove it.",
    "She spoke slowly and deliberately.",
    "So long as Gerda did not give\nherself away \n\n\fGerda said vaguely Im so sorry.",
    "Will you have some tea M. Poirot\n\nNo thank you Madame.",
    "Gerda sat down behind the tray.",
    "She began to talk in her apologetic\nconversational way.",
    "Im so sorry that everybody is out.",
    "My sister and the children have all\ngone for a picnic.",
    "I didnt feel very well so they left me behind.",
    "I am sorry Madame.",
    "Gerda lifted a teacup and drank.",
    "It is all so very worrying.",
    "Everything is so worrying... You see John\nalways arranged everything and now John is gone.",
    "Her voice trailed\noff.",
    "Now John is gone...",
    "Her gaze piteous bewildered went from one to the other.",
    "I dont know what to do without John.",
    "John looked after me...",
    "He took\ncare of me.",
    "Now he is gone everything is gone... And the children they ask me questions and I cant answer them properly.",
    "I dont know\nwhat to say to Terry.",
    "He keeps saying Why was Father killed Some\nday of course he will find out why... Terry always has to know.",
    "What\npuzzles me is that he always asks why not who\n\nGerda leaned back in her chair.",
    "Her lips were very blue.",
    "She said stiffly\n\nI feel  not very well  if John  John \n\nPoirot came round the table to her and eased her sideways down in\nthe chair.",
    "Her head dropped forward.",
    "He bent and lifted her eyelid.",
    "Then he straightened up.",
    "An easy and comparatively painless death.",
    "Henrietta stared at him.",
    "Heart No.",
    "Her mind leaped forward.",
    "Something in the tea...\nSomething she put there herself.",
    "She chose that way out\n\nPoirot shook his head gently.",
    "Oh no it was meant for you.",
    "It was in your teacup.",
    "For me Henriettas voice was incredulous.",
    "But I was trying to help\nher.",
    "That did not matter.",
    "Have you not seen a dog caught in a trap  it sets\nits teeth into anyone who touches it.",
    "She saw only that you knew her\nsecret and so you too must die.",
    "Henrietta said slowly\n\nAnd you made me put the cup back on the tray  you meant  you\nmeant her \n\n\fPoirot interrupted her quietly\n\nNo no Mademoiselle.",
    "I did not know that there was anything in your\nteacup.",
    "I only knew that there might be.",
    "And when the cup was on the\ntray it was an even chance if she drank from that or the other  if you\ncall it chance.",
    "I say myself that an end such as this is merciful.",
    "For her\n and for two innocent children...",
    "He said gently to Henrietta You are very tired are you not\n\nShe nodded.",
    "She asked him When did you guess\n\nI do not know exactly.",
    "The scene was set I felt that from the first.",
    "But I\ndid not realize for a long time that it was set by Gerda Christow  that\nher attitude was stagy because she was actually acting a part.",
    "I was\npuzzled by the simplicity and at the same time the complexity.",
    "I\nrecognized fairly soon that it was your ingenuity that I was fighting\nagainst and that you were being aided and abetted by your relations\nas soon as they understood what you wanted done He paused and\nadded Why did you want it done\n\nBecause John asked me to Thats what he meant when he said\nHenrietta.",
    "It was all there in that one word.",
    "He was asking me to\nprotect Gerda.",
    "You see he loved Gerda...",
    "I think he loved Gerda much\nbetter than he ever knew he did.",
    "Better than Veronica Cray  better\nthan me.",
    "Gerda belonged to him and John liked things that belonged\nto him...",
    "He knew that if anyone could protect Gerda from the\nconsequences of what shed done I could  And he knew that I would\ndo anything he wanted because I loved him.",
    "And you started at once said Poirot grimly.",
    "Yes the first thing I could think of was to get the revolver away from\nher and drop it in the pool.",
    "That would obscure the fingerprint\nbusiness.",
    "When I discovered later that he had been shot with a\ndifferent gun I went out to look for it and naturally found it at once\nbecause I knew just the sort of place Gerda would have put it  I was\nonly a minute or two ahead of Inspector Granges men.",
    "She paused and then went on\n\nI kept it with me in that satchel bag of mine until I could take it up to\nLondon.",
    "Then I hid it in the studio until I could bring it back and put it\nwhere the police would find it.",
    "The clay horse murmured Poirot.",
    "How did you know Yes I put it in a sponge bag and wired the\narmature round it and then slapped up the clay model round it.",
    "After\nall the police couldnt very well destroy an artists masterpiece could\nthey What made you know where it was\n\nThe fact that you chose to model a horse.",
    "The horse of Troy was the\nunconscious association in your mind.",
    "But the fingerprints  How did\nyou manage the fingerprints\n\nAn old blind man who sells matches in the street.",
    "He didnt know what\nit was I asked him to hold for a moment while I got some money out\n\n\fPoirot looked at her for a moment.",
    "Cest formidable he murmured.",
    "You are one of the best\nantagonists Mademoiselle that I have ever had.",
    "Its been dreadfully tiring always trying to keep one move ahead of\nyou\n\nI know.",
    "I began to realize the truth as soon as I saw that the pattern\nwas always designed not to implicate anyone person but to implicate\neveryone  other than Gerda Christow.",
    "Every indication always pointed\naway from her.",
    "You deliberately planted Ygdrasil to catch my attention\nand bring yourself under suspicion.",
    "Lady Angkatell who knew\nperfectly what you were doing amused herself by leading poor\nInspector Grange in one direction after another.",
    "David Edward\nherself.",
    "Yes there is only one thing to do if you want to clear a person from\nsuspicion who is actually guilty.",
    "You must suggest guilt elsewhere but\nnever localize it.",
    "That is why every clue looked promising and then\npetered out and ended in nothing.",
    "Henrietta looked at the figure huddled pathetically in the chair.",
    "She\nsaid Poor Gerda.",
    "Is that what you have felt all along\n\nI think so... Gerda loved John terribly  but she didnt want to love him\nfor what he was.",
    "She built up a pedestal for him and attributed every\nsplendid and noble and unselfish characteristic to him.",
    "And if you cast\n\n\fdown an idol theres nothing left... She paused and then went on.",
    "But John was something much finer than an idol on a pedestal.",
    "He\nwas a real living vital human being.",
    "He was generous and warm and\nalive and he was a great doctor  yes a great doctor And hes dead\nand the world has lost a very great man.",
    "And I have lost the only man I\nshall ever love...\n\nPoirot put his hand gently on her shoulder.",
    "He said\n\nBut you are of those who can live with a sword in their hearts  who\ncan go on and smile \n\nHenrietta looked up at him.",
    "Her lips twisted into a bitter smile.",
    "Thats\na little melodramatic isnt it\n\nIt is because I am a foreigner and I like to use fine words.",
    "Henrietta said suddenly\n\nYou have been very kind to me.",
    "That is because I have admired you always very much.",
    "M. Poirot what are we going to do About Gerda I mean.",
    "Poirot drew the raffia workbag towards him.",
    "He turned out its\ncontents scraps of brown suede and other coloured leathers.",
    "There\nwere three fragments of thick shiny brown leather.",
    "Poirot fitted them\ntogether.",
    "The holster.",
    "I take this.",
    "And poor Madame Christow she was\noverwrought her husbands death was too much for her.",
    "It will be\nbrought in that she took her life whilst of unsound mind \n\nHenrietta said slowly\n\nAnd no one will ever know what really happened\n\nI think one person will know.",
    "Dr. Christows son.",
    "I think that one day\nhe will come to me and ask me for the truth.",
    "But you wont tell him cried Henrietta.",
    "Yes I shall tell him.",
    "Oh no\n\nYou do not understand.",
    "To you it is unbearable that anyone should be\nhurt.",
    "But to some minds there is something more unbearable still  not\nto know.",
    "You heard that poor woman just a little while ago say Terry\nalways has to know... To the scientific mind truth comes first.",
    "Truth\nhowever bitter can be accepted and woven into a design for living.",
    "Henrietta got up.",
    "Do you want me here or had I better go\n\nIt would be better if you went I think.",
    "She nodded.",
    "Then she said more to herself than to him\n\n\fWhere shall I go What shall I do  without John\n\nYou are speaking like Gerda Christow.",
    "You will know where to go and\nwhat to do.",
    "Shall I Im so tired M. Poirot so tired...",
    "He said gently\n\nGo my child.",
    "Your place is with the living.",
    "I will stay here with the\ndead...\n\nChapter 30\n\nAs she drove towards London the two phrases echoed through\nHenrietta s mind  What shall I do Where shall I go\n\nFor the last few weeks she had been strung up excited never relaxing\nfor a moment.",
    "She had had a task to perform  a task laid on her by\nJohn.",
    "But now that was over  had she failed or succeeded One could\nlook at it either way...",
    "But however one looked at it the task was over.",
    "And she experienced the terrible weariness of the reaction.",
    "Her mind went back to the words she had spoken to Edward that night\non the terrace  the night of Johns death  the night when she had gone\nalong to the pool and into the pavilion and had deliberately by the light\nof a match drawn Ygdrasil upon the iron table.",
    "Purposeful planning \n\n\fnot yet able to sit down and mourn  mourn for her dead.",
    "I should\nlike she had said to Edward to grieve for John...",
    "But she had not dared to relax then  not dared to let sorrow take\ncommand over her...",
    "But now she could grieve.",
    "Now she had all the time there was...\n\nShe said under her breath John... John...",
    "Bitterness and black rebellion broke over her...\n\nShe thought I wish Id drunk that cup of tea...\n\nDriving the car soothed her gave her strength for the moment...",
    "But\nsoon she would be in London.",
    "Soon she would put the car in the\ngarage and go along to the empty studio...",
    "Empty since John would\nnever sit there again bullying her being angry with her loving her\nmore than he wanted to love her telling her eagerly about Ridgeways\nDisease  about his triumphs and despairs about Mrs. Crabtree and St.\nChristophers...\n\nAnd suddenly with a lifting of the dark pall that lay over her mind she\nsaid aloud\n\nOf course.",
    "Thats where I will go.",
    "To St. Christophers...",
    "Lying in her narrow hospital bed old Mrs. Crabtree peered up at her\nvisitor out of rheumy twinkling eyes.",
    "She was exactly as John had described her and Henrietta felt a\nsudden warmth a lifting of the spirit.",
    "This was real  this would last\nHere for a little space she had found John again...",
    "The pore doctor.",
    "Orful aint it Mrs. Crabtree was saying.",
    "There was\nrelish in her voice as well as regret for Mrs. Crabtree loved life and\nsudden deaths particularly murders or deaths in childbed were the\nrichest parts of the tapestry of life.",
    "Getting imself bumped off like\nthat Turned my stomach right over it did when I eard.",
    "I read all about\nit in the papers  Sister let me ave all she could get old of  reely nice\nabout it she was.",
    "There was pictures and everythink... That swimming\npool and all.",
    "Is wife leaving the inquest pore thing and that Lady\nAngkatell what the swimming pool belonged to Lots of pictures.",
    "Real\nmystery the ole thing werent it\n\nHenrietta was not repelled by her ghoulish enjoyment.",
    "She liked it\nbecause she knew that John himself would have liked it.",
    "If he had to\ndie he would much prefer old Mrs. Crabtree to get a kick out of it than\nto sniff and shed tears.",
    "All I ope is that they catch ooever done it and ang im continued\nMrs. Crabtree vindictively.",
    "They dont ave angings in public like they\nused to once  mores the pity.",
    "Ive always thought Id like to go to an\nanging... And Id go double quick if you understand me to see ooever\nkilled the doctor anged Real wicked e must ave been.",
    "Why the\ndoctor was one in a thousand Ever so clever e was And a nice way\nwith im Got you laughing whether you wanted to or not.",
    "The things e\nused to say sometimes Id ave done anythink for the doctor I would\n\n\fYes said Henrietta.",
    "He was a very clever man.",
    "He was a great\nman.",
    "Think the world of im in the orspital they do All them nurses.",
    "And is\npatients Always felt you were going to get well when ed been along.",
    "So you are going to get well said Henrietta.",
    "The little shrewd eyes clouded for a moment.",
    "Im not so sure about that ducky.",
    "Ive got that mealymouthed young\nfellow with the spectacles now.",
    "Quite different to Dr. Christow.",
    "Never a\nlaugh E was a one Dr. Christow was  always up to is jokes Given me\nsome norful times e as with this treatment of is.",
    "I cant stand any\nmore of it doctor Id say to im and Yes you can Mrs. Crabtree ed\nsay to me.",

    "Excuse me dearie youre not the doctors wife by any chance\n\nNo said Henrietta Im just a friend.",
    "I see said Mrs. Crabtree.",
    "Henrietta thought that she did see.",
    "What made you come along if you dont mind me arsking\n\nThe doctor used to talk to me a lot about you  and about his new\ntreatment.",
    "I wanted to see how you were.",
    "Im slipping back  thats what Im doing.",
    "Henrietta cried\n\nBut you mustnt slip back Youve got to get well.",
    "Mrs. Crabtree grinned.",
    "I dont want to peg out dont you think it\n\nWell fight then Dr. Christow said you were a fighter.",
    "Did e now Mrs. Crabtree lay still a minute then she said slowly\n\nOoever shot im its a wicked shame There arent many of is sort...\n\nWe shall not see his like again... the words passed through Henriettas\nmind.",
    "Mrs. Crabtree was regarding her keenly.",
    "Keep your pecker up dearie she said.",
    "She added Ead a nice\nfuneral I ope.",
    "He had a lovely funeral said Henrietta obligingly.",
    "Ar Wish I could of gorn to it\n\nMrs. Crabtree sighed.",
    "Be going to me own funeral next I expect.",
    "No cried Henrietta.",
    "You mustnt let go.",
    "You said just now that Dr.\nChristow told you that you and he were going to make medical history.",
    "Well youve got to carry on by yourself.",
    "The treatments just the same.",
    "Youve got to have the guts for two  youve got to make medical history\nby yourself  for him.",
    "Mrs. Crabtree looked at her for a moment or two.",
    "Sounds a bit grand Ill do my best ducky.",
    "Cant say more than that.",
    "Henrietta got up and took her hand.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Ill come and see you again if I may.",
    "Yes do.",
    "Itll do me good to talk about the doctor a bit.",
    "The bawdy twinkle came into her eye again.",
    "Proper man in every kind\nof way Dr. Christow.",
    "Yes said Henrietta.",
    "He was...",
    "The old woman said\n\n\fDont fret ducky  whats gorns gorn.",
    "You cant ave it back...\n\nMrs. Crabtree and Hercule Poirot Henrietta thought expressed the\nsame idea in different language.",
    "She drove back to Chelsea put away the car in the garage and walked\nslowly to the studio.",
    "Now she thought it has come.",
    "The moment I have been dreading  the\nmoment when I am alone...\n\nNow I can put it off no longer... Now grief is here with me.",
    "What had she said to Edward I should like to grieve for John...\n\nShe dropped down on a chair and pushed back the hair from her face.",
    "Alone  empty  destitute...",
    "This awful emptiness.",
    "The tears pricked at her eyes flowed slowly down her cheeks.",
    "Grief she thought grief for John...\n\nOh John  John...\n\nRemembering  remembering... His voice sharp with pain\n\n\fIf I were dead the first thing youd do with the tears streaming down\nyour face would be to start modelling some damned mourning woman\nor some figure of grief.",
    "She stirred uneasily... Why had that thought come into her head\n\nGrief... Grief... A veiled figure... its outline barely perceptible  its head\ncowled...\n\nAlabaster...\n\nShe could see the lines of it  tall elongated... its sorrow hidden\nrevealed only by the long mournful lines of the drapery...\n\nSorrow emerging from clear transparent alabaster.",
    "If I were dead...\n\nAnd suddenly bitterness came over her full tide\n\nShe thought Thats what I am John was right.",
    "I cannot love  I cannot\nmourn  not with the whole of me... Its Midge its people like Midge\nwho are the salt of the earth.",
    "Midge and Edward at Ainswick...\n\nThat was reality  strength  warmth...",
    "But I she thought am not a whole person.",
    "I belong not to myself but to\nsomething outside me...",
    "I cannot grieve for my dead...",
    "Instead I must take my grief and make it into a figure of alabaster...\n\nExhibit N. 58 Grief Alabaster.",
    "Miss Henrietta Savernake.",
    "She said under her breath\n\nJohn forgive me... forgive me... for what I cant help doing..."
