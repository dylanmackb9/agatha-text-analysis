    "I \u00a2ish to assure my readers that I can vouch for the occurrences related\nin these chapters.",
    "If I have taken a certain poetic license in descriling\nthe thoughts and feelings of various persons it is because I\nbelieve I have set them down with a reasonable amount of accuracy.",
    "I\nmay add that they have been vetted by my friend Hercule Poirot\n\n\fhimself.",
    "Irt conclusion I will say that if I have described at too great length\nsome of the secondary personal relationships which arose as a consequeoe\nof this strange series of crimes it is because the human and personal\nelement can never be ignored.",
    "Hercule Poirot once taught me in a\nvery dramatic manner that romance can be a byproduct of crime.",

    "The Letter\n\nIt was in June of 1935 that I came home from my ranch in South America\n\n\ffor a stay of about six months.",
    "It had been a difficult time for us out\nthere.",
    "Like every one else we had suffered from world depression.",
    "I\nhad various affairs to see to in England that I felt could only be successful\nif a personal touch was introduced.",
    "My wife remained to manage\nthe ranch.",
    "I need hardly say that one of my first actions on reaching England\nwas to look up my old friend Hercule Poirot.",
    "I found him installed in one of the newest type of service flats in\nLondon.",
    "I accused him and he admitted the fact of having chosen this\nparticular building entirely on account of its strictly geometrical\npearance and proportions.",
    "But yes my friend it is of a most pleasing symmetry do you not\nfind it so\nI said that I thought there could be too much squareness and alluding\nto an old joke I asked if in this supermodern hostelry they managed\nto induce hens to lay square eggs\nPoirot laughed heartily.",
    "Ah you remember that Alas noscience has not yet induced the\nhens to conform to modern tastes they still lay eggs of different sizes\nand colours\nI examined my old friend with an affectionate eye.",
    "He was looking\nwonderfully wellhardly a day older than when I had last seen him.",
    "AGATHA CHRISTIE\n\n\fYoure looking in fine fettle Poirot I said.",
    "Youve hardly aged\nat all.",
    "In fact if it were possible I should say that you had fewer grey\n\nhairs than when I saw you last.",
    "Poirot beamed on me.",
    "And why is that not possible It is quite true.",
    "Do you mean your hair is turning from grey to black instead of\n\nfrom black to grey\n\nPrecisely.",
    "But surely thats a scientific impossibility\n\nNot at all.",
    "But thats very extraordinary.",
    "It seems against nature.",
    "As usual Hastings you have the beautiful and unsuspicious mind.",
    "Years do not change that in you You perceive a fact and mention the\nsolution of it in the same breath without noticing that you are doing\n\n\fSO\n\nI stared at him puzzled.",
    "Without a word he walked into his bedroom and returned with a bottle\nin his hand which he handed to me.",
    "I took it for the moment uncomprehending.",
    "It bore the words\n\nREVlVlT.To bring back the natural tone of the hair.",
    "REVlVIT is\n\n\u00b7 NOT a dye.",
    "In five shades Ash Chestnut 7tian Brown Black.",
    "Poirot I cried.",
    "You have dyed your hair\n\nAh the comprehension comes to you\n\nSo thatwhy your hair looks so much blacker than it did last time\nI was back.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Dear me I said recovering from the shock.",
    "I suppose next time I\ncome home I shall find you wearing false moustachesor are you\ndoing so now\n\nPoirot winced.",
    "His moustaches had always been his sensitive point.",

    "My words touched him on the raw.",
    "No no indeed mort ami.",
    "That day I pray the good God is still far\noff.",
    "The false moustaches Quelle horreur\n\nHe tugged at them vigorously to assure me of their genuine character.",

    "THE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS\n\nA good job too I thought privately.",
    "But I would not for the world\nhave hurt Poirots feelings by saying so.",
    "Instead I asked if he still practiced his profession on occasions.",
    "I know I said that you actually retired years agog\nCest vrai.",
    "To grow the vegetable marrows And immediately a\n\n\fmurder occursand I send the vegetable marrows to promenade\nthemselves to the devil.",
    "And since thenI know very well what you\nwill sayI am like the Prima Donna who makes positively the farewell\nperformance That farewell performance it repeats itself an indefinite\nnumber of times\nI laughed.",
    "In truth it has been very like that.",
    "Each time I say This is the end.",
    "But no something else arises And I will admit it my friend the retirement\nI care for it not at all.",
    "If the little grey cells are not exercised they\ngrow the rust.",

    "Precisely\nthatcareless.",
    "But let us not talk of it.",
    "You know Hastings in many\nways I regard you as my mascot.",
    "Indeed I said.",
    "In what ways\nPoirot did not answer my question directly.",
    "He went on\n\n\fAs soon as I heard you were coming over I said to myself Something\nwill arise.",
    "As in former days we will hunt together we two.",
    "But if\nso it must be no common affair.",
    "It must be somethinghe waved his\nhands excitedlysomething recherchddelicatefine...",
    "He gave\nthe last untranslatable word its full fiavour.",
    "Upon my word Poirot I said.",
    "Any one would think you were ordering\na dinner at the Ritz.",
    "Whereas one cannot command a crime to order Very true.",
    "He\nsighed.",
    "But I believe in luckin destiny if you will.",
    "It is your destiny\nto stand beside me and prevent me from committing the unforgivable\nerror.",
    "4\n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nWhat do you call the unforgivable error\n\nOverlooking the obvious.",
    "I turned this over in my mind without quite seeing the point.",
    "Well I said presently smiling has this super crime turned up\nyet\n\n\fPas encore.",
    "At leastthat\n\nHe paused.",
    "A frown of perplexity creased his forehead.",
    "His hands\nautomatically straightened an object or two that I had inadvertently\npushed awry.",
    "I am not sure he said slowly.",
    "There was something so odd about his tone that I looked at him in\nsurprise.",
    "The frown still iingered.",
    "Suddenly with a brief decisive nod of the head he crossed the room\nto a desk near the window.",
    "Its contents I need hardly say were all\nneatly docketed and pigeonholed so that he was able at once to lay his\nhand upon the paper he wanted.",
    "He came slowly across to me an open letter in his hand.",
    "He read it\nthrough himself then passed it to me.",
    "Tell me rnon ami he said.",
    "What do you make of thisT\n\nI took it from him with some interest.",
    "It was written on thickish white notepaper in printed characters\n\nMR. HERCULE POIROTYou fancy yourself dont you at solving\nmysteries that are too dicult for our poor thickheaded British police\n Let us see Mr.",

    "That also was printed.",
    "Postmarked W.C. 1 said Poirot as I turned my attention to the\npostmark.",
    "Well what is your opinion.",
    "I shrugged my shoulders as I handed it back to him.",
    "Some madman or other I suppose.",
    "That is all you have to say.",
    "Welldoesnt it sound like a madman to youT\n\n\fYes my friend it does.",
    "His tone was grave.",

    "A madman is a very\ndangerous thing.",
    "Yes of course that is true ....",
    "I hadnt considered that point ....",
    "But what I meant was it sounds more like a rather idiotic kind of hoax.",
    "Perhaps some convivial idiot who had had one over the eight.",
    "Comment Nine7 Nine what\nNothingjust an expression.",
    "I meant a fellow who was tight.",
    "No\ndamn it a fellow who had had a spot too much to drink.",

    "They get\n\n\fthese things every day at Scotland Yard.",

    "There are\nno fingerprints on it.",
    "There are no local clues as to the possible writer.",
    "In\nfact there is only your own instinct.",
    "Not\ninstinct Hastings.",
    "Instinct is a bad word.",
    "It is my knowledgemy\nexperiencethat tells me that something about that letter\nis wrong\nHe\n\n\n\n\fgesticulated as words failed him then shook his head again.",
    "I\nmay be making the mountain out of the anthill.",
    "In any case there is\nnothing to be done but wait.",
    "Well\nthe 21 st is Friday.",
    "If a whacking great robbery takes place near\nAndover then\nAh\nwhat a comfort that would be I \n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nA comfort.",
    "I stared.",
    "The word seemed to be a very extraordinary\none to use.",
    "A robbery may be a thrill but it can hardly be a comfort I protested.",
    "Poirot shook his head energetically.",
    "You are in error my friend.",
    "You do not understand my meaning.",
    "A\nrobbery would be a relief since it would dispossess my mind of the fear\n\nof something else.",
    "Of what\n\nMurder said Hercule Poirot.",
    "II.",
    "Not from Captain Hastings\nPersonal Narrative\n\nMr. Alexander Bonaparte Cust rose from his seat and peered nearsightedly\nround the shabby bedroom.",
    "His back was stiff from sitting in\na cramped position and as he stretched himself to his full height an onlooker\nwould have realized that he was in reality quite a tall man.",
    "His\nstoop and his nearsighted peering gave a delusive impression.",
    "Going to a wellworn overcoat hanging on the back of the door he\ntook from the pocket a packet of cheap cigarettes and some matches.",
    "He lit a cigarette and then returned to the table at which he had been\nsitting.",
    "He picked up a railway guide and co0sulted it then he returned\nto the consideration of a typewritten list of names.",
    "With a pen he made\na tick against one of the first names on the list.",
    "It was Thursday June 20th.",
    "III.",
    "Andover\n\nI had been impressed at the time by Poirots forebodings about the\nanonymous letter he had received but I must admit that the matter had\npassed from my mind when the 21st actually arrived and the first reminder\nof it came with a visit paid to my friend by Chief Inspector\nJapp of Scotland Yard.",
    "The C.I.D.",
    "inspector had been known to us for\nmany years and he gave me a hearty welcome.",
    "Well I never he exclaimed.",
    "If it isnt Captain Hastings back\nfrom the wilds of the what do you call it Quite like old days seeing\nyou here with Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Youre looking well too.",
    "Just a little\nbit thin on top eh Well thats what were all coming to.",
    "Im the\nsame.",
    "I winced slightly.",
    "I was under the impression that owing to the careful\nway I brushed my hair across the top of my head that thinness referred\nto by Japp was quite unnoticeable.",
    "However Japp had never\nbeen remarkable for tact where I was concerned so I put a good face\nupon it and agreed that we were none of us getting any younger.",
    "Except Monsieur Poirot here said Japp.",
    "Quite a good advertisement\nfor a hair tonic hed be.",
    "Face fungus sprouting finer than ever.",
    "Coming out into the limelight too in his old age.",
    "Mixed up in all the\n\n\fcelebrated cases of the day.",
    "Train mysteries air mysteries high society\ndeathsoh hes here there and everywhere.",
    "Never been so celebrated\nas since he retired.",
    "THE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS\n\nI have already told Hastings that I am like the Prima Donna who\nmakes always one more appearance said Poirot smiling.",
    "Shouldnt wonder if you ended by detecting your own death said\nJapp laughing heartily.",
    "Thats an idea that is.",
    "Ought to be put in a\nbook.",
    "It will be Hastings who will have to do that said Poirot twinkling\nat me.",
    "Ha ha That would be a joke that would laughed Japp.",
    "I failed to see why the idea was so extremely amusing and in any\ncase I thought the joke was in poor taste.",
    "Poirot poor old chap is getting\non.",
    "Jokes about his approaching demise can hardly be agreeable to\nhim.",
    "Perhaps my manner showed my feelings for Japp changed the subject.",
    "Have you heard about Monsieur Poirots anonymous letter he\nasked.",
    "I showed it to Hastings the other day said my friend.",
    "Of course I exclaimed.",
    "It had quite slipped my memory.",
    "Let me\nsee what was the date mentioned\n\n\fThe 21st said Japp.",
    "Thats what I dropped in about.",
    "Yesterday\nwas the 21st and just out of curiosity I rang up Andover last night.",
    "It\nwas a hoax all right.",
    "Nothing doing.",
    "One broken shop windowkid\nthrowing stonesand a couple of drunk and disorderlies.",
    "So just for\nonce our Belgian friend was barking up the wrong tree.",
    "I am relieved I must confess acknowledged Poirot.",
    "Youd quite got the wind up about it hadnt you said Japp affectionately.",
    "Bless you we get dozens of letters like that coming in every\nday People with nothing better to do and a bit weak in the top story sit\ndown and write em.",
    "They dont mean any harm Just a kind of excitement.",
    "I have indeed been foolish to take the matter so seriously said\nPoirot.",
    "It is the nest of the horse that I put my nose into there.",
    "Youre mixing up mares and wasps said Japp.",
    "Pardon \nJust a couple of proverbs.",
    "Well I must be off.",
    "Got a little business\nin the next street to see toreceiving stolen jewelry.",
    "I thought Id just\ndrop in on my way and put your mind at rest.",
    "Pity to let those grey cells\nfunction unnecessarily.",
    "With which words and a hearty laugh Japp departed.",
    "He does not change much the good Japp eh asked Poirot.",
    "l0\n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\n\fHe looks much older I said.",
    "Getting as grey as a badger I\nadded vindictively.",
    "Poirot coughed and said\nYou know Hastings there is a little devicemy hairdresser is a\nman of great ingenuityone attaches it to the scalp and brushes ones\nown hair over itit is not a wig you comprehendbut\nPoirot I roared.",
    "Once and for all I will have nothing to do with\nthe beastly inventions of your confounded hairdresser.",
    "Whats the matter\nwith the top of my head\nNothingnothing at all.",
    "Its not as though I were going bald.",
    "Of course not Of course not\nThe hot summers out there naturally cause the hair to fall out a bit.",
    "I shall take back a really good hair tonic.",
    "Prdcisdment.",
    "And anyway what business is it of Japps He always was an offensive\nkind of devil.",
    "And no sense of humour.",
    "The kind of man who\nlaughs when a chair is pulled away just as a man is about to sit down.",
    "A great many people would laugh at that.",
    "Its utterly senseless.",
    "From the point of view of the man about to sit certainly it is.",
    "Well I said slightly recovering my temper.",
    "I admit that I am\ntouchy about the thinness of my hair.",
    "Im sorry that anonymous letter\nbusiness came to nothing.",
    "I have indeed been in the wrong over that.",
    "About that letter there\nwas I thought the odour of the fish.",
    "Instead a mere stupidity.",
    "Alas I\n\n\fgrow old and suspicious like the blind watchdog who growls when\nthere is nothing there.",
    "If Im going to cooperate with you we must look about for some\nother creamy crime I said with a laugh.",
    "You remember your remark of the other day If you could order a\ncrime as one orders a dinner what would you choose\nI fell in with his humour.",
    "Let me see now.",
    "Lets review the menu.",
    "Robbery Forgery No I\nthink not.",
    "Rather too vegetarian.",
    "It must be murderredblooded\nmurderwith trimmings of course.",

    "Who shall the victim beman or woman Man I think.",
    "Some bigwig.",
    "American millionaire.",
    "Prime Minister.",
    "Newspaper proprietor.",
    "Scene of the crimewell whats wrong with the good old library\nNothing like it for atmosphere.",
    "As for the weaponwell it might be a\n\nTIlE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS\n\ncuriously twisted daggeror some blunt instrumenta carved stone\nidol\n\nPoirot sighed.",
    "Or of course I said theres poisonbut thats always so technical.",
    "Or a revolver shot echoing in the night.",
    "Then there must be a beautiful\ngirl or two\n\nWith auburn hair murmured my friend.",
    "Your same old joke.",
    "One of the beautiful girls of course must be\nunjustly suspectedand theres some misunderstanding between her\nand the young man.",
    "And then of course there must be some other\nsuspectsan older womark dangerous typeand some friend\nor rival of the dead mansand a quiet secretarydark horseand a\nhearty man with a bluff mannerand a couple of discharged servants\nor gamekeepers or somethingand a damn fool of a detective rather\nlike Jappand wellthats about all.",
    "That is your idea of the cream eh\nI gather you dont agree.",
    "Poirot looked at me sadly.",
    "You have made there a very pretty r6sum6 of nearly all the detective\nstories that have ever been written.",
    "Well I said.",
    "What would you order\n\nPoirot closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.",
    "His voice came\npuningly from between his lips.",
    "A very simple crime.",
    "A crime with no complications.",
    "A crime of\n\nquiet domestic life.. very unimpassionedvery intime.",
    "How can a crime be intime\n\nSupposing murmured Poirot that four people sit down to play\nbridge and one the odd man out sits in a chair by the fire.",
    "At the end of\nthe evening the man by the fire is found dead.",
    "One of the four while he\nis dummy has gone over and killed him and intent on the play of the\nhand the other three have not noticed.",
    "Ah there would be a crime for\nyou Which of the four was it\n\nWell I said.",
    "I cant see any excitement in that\n\nPoirot threw me a glance of reproof.",
    "No because there are no curiously twisted daggers no blackmail\nno emerald that is the stolen eye of a god no untraceable Eastern poisons.",
    "You have the melodramatic soul Hastings.",
    "You would like not\none murder but a series of murders.",
    "I admit I said that a second murder in a book often cheers things\nup.",
    "If the murder happens in the first chapter and you have to follow\n\n\fAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nup everybodys alibi until the last page but onewell it does get a bit\ntedious.",
    "The telephone rang and Poirot rose to answer.",
    "Allo he said.",
    "Ailo.",
    "Yes it is Hercule Poirot speaking.",
    "He listened for a minute or two and then I saw his face change.",
    "His own side of the conversation was short and disjointed.",
    "Mais oui .",
    ". .",
    "Yes of course...",
    "But yes we will come...",
    "Naturally...",
    "It may be as you say...",
    "Yes I will bring it.",
    "A tout lheure then.",
    "He replaced the receiver and came across the room to me.",
    "That was Japp speaking Hastings.",
    "Yes.",
    "He had just got back to the Yard.",
    "There was a message from Andover....\nAndover I cried excitedly.",
    "Poirot said slowly\nAn old woman of the name of Ascher who keeps a little tobacco\nand newspaper shop has been found murdered.",
    "I think I felt ever so slightly damped.",
    "My interest quickened by the\nsound of Andover suffered a faint check.",
    "I had expected something\nfantasticout oftbe way The murder of an old woman who kept a litfie tobacco shop seemed somehow sordid and uninteresting.",
    "Poirot continued in the same slow grave voice\nThe Andover police believe they can put their hand on the man\nwho did it\nI felt a second throb of disappointment.",
    "It seems the woman was on bad terms with her husband.",
    "He drinks\nand is by way of being rather a nasty customer.",
    "Hes threatened to take\nher life more than once.",
    "Nevertheless continued Poirot in view of what has happened the\npolice there would like to have another look at the anonymous letter l\nreceived.",
    "I have said that you and I will go down to Andover at once \nMy spirits revived a little.",
    "After all sordid as this crime seemed\nbe it was a crime and it was a long time since I had had any associltion\nwith crime and criminals.",
    "I hardly listened to the next words Poirot said.",

    "When the police s\ngeon arrived on the spot it was elicited that the woman had been stru\ndown by a heavy blow on the back of the head probably while she n\nreaching down a packet of cigarettes from the shelf behind the count\nDeath must have occurred about nine to seven hours previously.",
    "But weve been able to get it down a bit nearer than that e\nplained the inspector.",
    "Weve found a man who went in and boug\nsome tobacco at 530.",
    "And a second man went in and found the sh\nempty as he thought at five minutes past six.",

    "Then the murderer could just as well be a woman as a man\nThe suggestion took the doctor somewhat aback.",
    "A woman eh Well I confess it never occurred to me to connect a\nwoman with this type of crime.",
    "But of course its possibleperfectly\npossible.",
    "Only psychologically speaking I shouldnt say this was a\nwomans crime.",

    "Perfectly perfectly.",

    "I have a reason.",
    "He did not explain further and a few minutes later we were driving\non the London road in the direction of Overton.",
    "The address which the inspector had given us was that of a goodsized\nhouse about a mile on the London side of the village.",

    "We entered and\nPoirot seating himself on a chair by the window looked up keenly into\nthe girls face.",
    "You have heard of your aunts death of course\n\nThe girl nodded tears coming once more into her eyes.",
    "This morning sir.",
    "The police came over.",
    "Oh its terrible Poor\nauntie Such a hard life as shed had too.",
    "And now thisits too awful.",

    "And yet auntie says he was a fine handsome figure of a m\nwhen she married him.",
    "Its dreadful to think sir what people come t\u00a2\nYes indeed.",
    "And so I suppose Mary having actually heard the\nthreats you were not so very surprised when you learnt what had hal\npened\nOh but I was sir.",
    "You see sir I never thought for one moment th\nhe meant it.",
    "I thought it was just nasty talk and nothing more to it.",
    "AJ\nit isnt as though auntie was afraid of him.",
    "Why Ive seen him sli\naway like a dog with its tail between its legs when she turned on hi He was afraid of her if you like.",
    "And yet she gave him money\nWell he was her husband you see sir.",
    "Yes so you said before.",

    "Didnt kill her\nShe stared.",
    "That is what I said.",
    "Supposing some one else killed her.... Ha\nyou any idea who that some one else could be\nShe stared at him with even more amazement.",
    "Ive no idea sir.",
    "It doesnt seem likely though does itT\nThere was no one your aunt was afraid of.",
    "Mary shook her head.",
    "Auntie wasnt afraid of people.",
    "Shed a sharp tongue and she\nstand up to anybody.",
    "You never heard her mention any one who had a grudge again\n\n\fher\nNo indeed sin\nDid she ever get anonymous letters\nWhat kind of letters did you say sir\nLetters that werent signedor only signed by something In\nA.B.C.",

    "If I want you at any time Mary I will write to\nyou here.",
    "As a matter of fact sir Im giving in my notice.",
    "I dont like the\ncountry.",
    "I stayed here because I fancied it was a comfort to auntie to\nhave me near by.",
    "But nowagain the tears rose in her eyestheres\n\n\fno reason I should stay and so Ill go back to London.",
    "Its gayer for a\ngirl there.",
    "I wish that when you do go you would give me your address.",
    "Here\nis my card.",
    "He handed it to her.",
    "She looked at it with a puzzled frown.",

    "The Scene of the Crime\n\nThe street in which the tragedy had occurred was a turning offthe main\nstreet.",
    "Mrs. Aschers shop was situated about halfway down it on the\nrighthand side.",
    "As we turned into the street Poirot glanced at his watch and I realized\n\n\fwhy he had delayed his visit to the scene of the crime until now.",
    "It\nwas just on halfpast five He had wished to reproduce yesterdays atmosphere\nas closely as possible.",
    "But if that had been his purpose it was defeated.",
    "Certainly at this\nmoment the road bore very little likeness to its appearance on the previous\nevening.",
    "There were a certain number of small shops interspersed\nbetween private houses of the poorer class.",
    "I judged that\nordinarily there would be a fair number of people passing up and\ndownmostly people of the poorer classes with a good sprinkling of\nchildren playing on the pavements and in the road.",
    "At this moment there was a solid mass of people standing stating at\none particular house or shop and it took little perspicuity to guess\nwhich that was.",
    "What we saw was a mass of average human beings\nlooking with intense interest at the spot where another human being\nhad been done to death.",
    "As we drew nearer this proved to be indeed the case.",
    "In front of a\nsmall dingylooking shop with its shutters now closed stood a\nharassedlooking young policeman who was stolidly adjuring the\ncrowd to pass along there.",

    "Poirot stopped a little distance from the main body of the crowd.",
    "From where we stood the legend painted over the door could be read\nplainly enough.",
    "Poirot repeated it under his breath.",
    "A. Ascher.",
    "Oui c est peuttre a He broke off.",
    "Come let us go inside Hastings.",
    "I was only too ready.",
    "We made our way through the crowd and accosted the young policeman.",
    "Poirot produced the credentials which the inspector had given\nhim.",
    "The constable nodded and unlocked the door to let us pass\nwithin.",
    "We did so and entered to the intense interest of the lookerson.",
    "Inside it was very dark owing to the shutters being closed.",
    "The\nconstable found and switched on the electric light.",
    "The bulb was a lowpowered one so that the interior was still dimly lit.",
    "I looked about me.",
    "A dingy little place.",
    "A few cheap magazines strewn about and yesterdays\nnewspapersall with a days dust on them.",
    "Behind the\ncounter a row of shelves reaching to the ceiling and packed with tobacco\nand packets of cigarettes.",
    "There were also a couple of jars o\n\n\fpeppermint humbugs and barley sugar.",

    "Down in a heap behind the counter thats where she was.",
    "Doctor\nsays as how she never knew what hit her.",
    "Must have been reaching up\nto one of the shelves.",
    "There was nothing in her hand\nNo sir but there was a packet of Players down beside her.",

    "And the railway guide waswhere\nHere sir.",
    "The constable pointed out the spot on the counter.",
    "It\nwas open at the right page for Andover and lying face down.",
    "Seems\nthough he must have been looking up the trains to London.",

    "Yes sir you go through that door at the back sir.",
    "Youll excuse me\nfrom coming with you but Ive got to stay\nPoirot passed through the door in question and I followed him.",
    "Behind\nthe shop was a microscopic sort of parlour and kitchen\ncombined it was neat and clean but very drearylooking and scantily\nfurnished.",
    "On the mantelpiece were a few photographs.",
    "I went up and\nlooked at them and Poirot joined me.",
    "The photographs were three in all.",
    "One was a cheap portrait of the\ngirl we had been with that afternoon Mary Drower.",
    "She was obviously\nwearing her best clothes and had the selfconscious wooden smile on\nher face that so often disfigures the expression in posed photography\nand makes a snapshot preferable.",
    "The second was a more expensive type of picturean artistically\nblurred reproduction of an elderly woman with white hair.",
    "A high fur\ncollar stood up round the neck.",
    "I guessed that this was probably the Miss Rose who had left Mrs.\nAscher the small legacy which had enabled her to start in business.",
    "The third photograph was a very old one now faded and yellow.",
    "It\nrepresented a young man and woman in somewhat oldfashioned\nclothes standing arm in arm.",
    "The man had a flower in his buttonhole\nand there was an air of bygone festivity about the whole pose.",
    "Probably a wedding picture said Poirot.",
    "Regard Hastings did I\nnot tell you that she had been a beautiful womanT\n\n\fHe was right.",
    "Disfigured by oldfashioned hairdressing and weird\nclothes there was no disguising the handsomeness of the girl in the\npicture with her clearcut features and spirited bearing.",
    "I looked\nclosely at the second figure.",
    "It was almost impossible to recognize the\nseedy Ascher in this smart young man with the military beating.",
    "I recalled the leering drunken old man and the worn toilworn face\nof the dead womanand I shivered a little at the remorselessness of\ntinle ....\nFrom the parlour a stair led to two upstairs rooms.",
    "One was empty\n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nand unfurnished the other had evidently been the dead womans bedroom.",

    "If there had been any personal papers the police had taken them.",
    "Pauvrefemme murmured Poirot.",
    "Come Hastings there is nothing\nfor us here.",
    "When we were once more in the street he hesitated for a minute or\n\n\ftwo then crossed the road.",
    "Almost exactly opposite Mrs. Aschers was\na greengrocers shopof the type that has most of its stock outside\nrather than inside.",
    "In a low voice Poirot gave me certain instructions.",
    "Then he himself\nentered the shop.",
    "After waiting a minute or two I followed him in.",
    "He\nwas at the moment negotiating for a lettuce.",
    "I myself bought a pound\nof strawberries.",
    "Poirot was talking animatedly to the stout lady who was serving\nhim.",
    "It was just opposite you was it not that this murder occurred\nWhat an affair What a sensation it must have caused you\nThe stout lady was obviously tired of talking about the murder.",
    "She\nmust have had a long day of it.",
    "She observed\nIt would be as well if some of that gaping crowd cleared off.",
    "What\nis there to look at Id like to know.",
    "It must have been very different last night said Poirot.",
    "Possibly\nyou even observed the murderer enter the shopa tall fair man with a\nbeard was he not A Russian so I have heard.",
    "Whats that The woman looked up sharply.",
    "A Russian did it.",
    "you sayT\nI understand that the police have arrested him.",
    "Did you ever nowT The woman was excited voluble.",
    "A foreigner.",
    "Mais oui.",

    "A short dark man I was told.",
    "An interested discussion intervened in which the stout lady her lank\nhusband and a hoarsevoiced shopboy all participated.",
    "No less than\nfour short dark men had been observed and the hoarse boy had seen a\ntall fair one but he hadnt got no beard he added regretfully.",
    "Finally our purchases made we left the establishment leaving our\nfalsehoods uncorrected.",
    "And what was the point of all that Poirot I demanded somewhat\nreproachfully.",
    "Parbleu I wanted to estimate the chances of a stranger being noticed\nentering the shop opposite.",
    "Couldnt you simply have askedwithout all that tissue of lies\nNo mon ami.",
    "If I had simply asked as you put it I should have\ngot no answer at all to my questions.",
    "You yourself are English and yet\nyou do not seem to appreciate the quality of the English reaction to a\ndirect question.",
    "It is invariably one of suspicion and the natural result\nis reticence.",
    "If I had asked those people for information they would\nhave shut up like oysters.",
    "But by making a statement and a somewhat\noutoftheway and preposterous one and by your contradiction of it\ntongues are immediately loosened.",
    "We know also that that particular\ntime was a busy timethat is that every one would be intent on their\nown concerns and that there would be a fair number of people passing\n\nalong the pavements.",
    "Our murderer chose his time well Hastings.",

    "From Inspector Glen What can I do for you Mr.\nPoirot\nI understand Mr. Partridge that you were the last person to see\nMrs. Ascher alive.",
    "Mr. Partridge placed his fingertips together and looked at Poirot as\nthough he were a doubtful cheque.",
    "That is a very debatable point Mr. Poiro he said.",

    "If so they have not come forward to say so.",
    "Mr. Partridge coughed.",
    "Some people Mr. Poirot have no sense of public duty.",

    "Exceedingly true murmured Poirot.",
    "You I understand went to\nthe police of your own accord\nCertainly I did.",
    "As soon as I heard of the shocking occurrence I\nperceived that my statement might be helpful and came forward accordingly.",
    "A very proper spirit said Poirot solemnly.",
    "Perhaps you will be\nso kind as to repeat your story to me.",
    "By all means.",
    "I was returning to this house and at 530 preciselyPardon\nhow was it that you knew the time so accurately\nMr Partridge looked a little annoyed at being interrupted.",
    "The church clock chimed.",
    "I looked at my watch and found I was a\nminute slow.",
    "That was just before I entered Mrs. Aschers shop.",
    "Were you in the habit of making purchases there\nFairly frequently.",
    "It was on my way home.",
    "About once or twice a\nweek I was in the habit of purchasing two ounces of John Cetn\nmild.",

    "Thank you Mr. Partridge for answering these questions.",
    "Have\nyou by any chance an A.B.C.",

    "Our next interview was with Mr. Albert Riddell and was of a highly\ndifferent character.",
    "Mr. Albert Riddell was a platelayer and our conversation\ntook place to the accompaniment of the clattering of plates\nand dishes by Mr. Riddells obviously nervous wife the growling of\n\n\fMr. Riddells dog and the undisguised hostility of Mr. Riddell himself.",
    "He was a big clumsy giant of a man with a broad face and small suspicious\neyes.",

    "He peered at us angrily over the rim of his cup.",
    "Told all Ive got to tell once havent I he growled.",

    "Best tell the gentleman what he wants Bert said the woman nervously.",
    "You shut your blarsted mouth roared the giant.",
    "You did not I think go to the police of your own accord.",
    "Poirot\nslipped the remark in neatly.",
    "Why the hell should I It were no business of mine.",
    "A matter of opinion said Poirot indifferently.",
    "There has been a\nmurderthe police want to know who has been in the shopI myself\n\n\fthink it would havewhat shall I saylooked more natural if you\nhad come forward.",
    "Ive got my work to do.",
    "Dont say I shouldnt have come forward\nin my own time\n\nBut as it was the police were given your name as that of a person\n\nATHA\n\nseen to go into Mrs. Aschers and they had to come to you.",
    "Were they\nsatisfied with your account\n\nWhy shouldnt they be demanded Bert truculently.",

    "What are you getting at mister Nobodys got anything against\nme Every one knows who did the old girl in that b of a husband\nof hers.",
    "But he was not in the street that evening and you were.",
    "Trying to fasten it on me are you Well you wont succeed.",

    "That you refuse it seems to mewhat shall we\nsaya little odd\n\nWho said I refused anything Mr. Riddell sank back again into his\nseat.",
    "I dont mind.",

    "Was there a railway guide lying about\n\nYes there wasface downwards.",

    "Perhaps you picked up the railway guide or moved it along the\ncounter\n\nDidnt touch the b thing.",
    "I did just what I said.",
    "And you did not see any one leaving the shop before you yourself\ngot there\n\nDidnt see any such thing.",

    "Poirot I cried.",
    "For a moment I was completely taken in.",
    "Then the twinkle in my\nfriends eye undeceived me.",
    "Poirot I said again this time in reproach.",
    "Mon ami what will you You fix upon me a look of doglike dewtion\nand demand of me a pronouncement h ia Sherlock Holmes Now\nfor the truthdo not know what the murderer looks like nor whett\nhe lives nor how to set hands upon him.",
    "If only he had left some clue I murmured.",
    "Yes the clueit is always the clue that attracts you.",
    "Alas that he\ndid not smoke the cigarette and leave the ash and then step in it with a\nshoe that has nails of a curious pattern.",
    "Nohe is not so obliging.",
    "But\nat least my friend you have the railway guide.",
    "The A.B.C.",
    "that is a\nclue for you\n\nDo you think he left it by mistake then\n\nOf course not.",

    "So that really the A.B.C.",
    "isnt helpful at all.",
    "Not in the sense you mean.",
    "In any sense\nPoirot did not answer at once.",
    "Then he said slowly\nThe answer to that is yes.",
    "We are confronted here by an unknow\npersonage.",
    "He is in the dark and seeks to remain in the dark.",
    "But in the\nvery nature of things he cannot help throwing light upon himself.",

    "The interviews\nwith those two men were disappointing.",
    "They couldnt tell us\nanything more than we knew already.",
    "To tell the truth I did not expect much in that line.",
    "But we could\nnot neglect two possible candidates for the murder.",

    "Do you really think\nNo Hastings.",

    "Oh Im the plain one of the family.",

    "Hes a very steady and hardworking man and would\nhave mqle her a good husband.",
    "Poiro continued to gaze at her.",
    "She did not flush under his glance\nbut retued it with one of her own equally steady and with something\nelse in isomething that reminded me of her first defiant disdainful\nmanner.",
    "So it is like that he said at last.",

    "Yes I see that now.",
    "Then let us continue our conversation.",
    "I have formed the idea that\nthis Donald Fraser has perhaps a violent and jealous temper is that\nright\nMegan Barnard said quietly\nIm trusting you now M. Poirot.",
    "Im going to give you the absolute\ntruth.",
    "Don is as I say a very quiet persona bottledup person if you\n\n\fknow what I mean.",
    "He cant always express what he feels in words.",
    "But underneath it all he minds things terribly.",
    "And hes got a jealous\nnature.",
    "He was always jealous of Betty.",
    "He was devoted to herand of\ncourse she was very fond of him but it waslit in Betty to be fond of\none person and not notice anybody else.",
    "She wasnt made that way.",
    "Shed got awell an eye for any nicelooking man whod pass the\ntime of day with her.",
    "And of course working in the Ginger Cat she\nwas always running up against menespecially in the summer holidays.",
    "She was always very pat with her tongte and if they chaffed her\nshed chaff back again.",
    "And then perhaps shed meet them and go to\nthe pictures or something like that.",
    "Nothing seriousnever anything\nof that kindbut she just liked her fun.",
    "She used to say that as shed\ngot to settle down with Don one day she might as well have her fun\nnow while she could.",
    "Megan paused and Poirot said\nI understand.",
    "Continue.",
    "It was just that attitude of mind of hers that Don couldnt understand.",
    "If she was really keen on him he couldnt see why she wanted to\ngo out with other people.",

    "M. Don he was no longer quiet\nIts like all those quiet people when they do lose their tempers they\nlose them with a vengeance.",
    "Don was so violent that Betty was frightened.",
    "Wlen was this\nThere was one row nearly a year ago and anothera worse one\n\n\fAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\njust over a month ago.",
    "I was home for the weekendand I got them to\npatch it up again and it was then that I tried to knock a little sense into\nBettytold her she was a little fool.",
    "All she would say was that there\nhadnt been any harm in it.",
    "Well that was true enough but all the same\nshe was riding for a fall.",
    "You see after the row a year ago shed got\ninto the habit of telling a few useful lies on the principle that what the\nmind doesnt know the heart doesnt grieve over.",
    "This last flareup\ncame because shed told Don she was going to Hastings to see a girl\npal and he found out that shed really been over to Eastbourne with\nsome man.",
    "He was a married man as it happened and hed been a bit\nsecretive about the business anywayand so that made it worse.",
    "They\nhad an awful sceneBetty saying that she wasnt married to him yet\nand she had a right to go about with whom she pleased and Don all\nwhite and shaking and saying that one dayone day\nYes\nHed commit murder said Megan in a lowered voice.",
    "She stopped and stared at Poirot.",
    "He nodded his head gravely several times.",
    "And so naturally you were afraid...",
    "I didnt think hed actually done itnot for a minute But I was\nafraid it might be brought upthe quarrel and all that hed saidseveral\npeople knew about it.",
    "Again Poirot nodded his head gravely.",
    "Just so.",
    "And I may say mademoiselle that but for the egotistical\n\n\fvanity of a killer that is just what would have happened.",
    "If Donald Fraser\nescapes suspicion it will be thanks to A.B.C.s maniacal boasting.",
    "He was silent for a minute or two then he said\nDo you know if your sister met this married man or any other man\nlately\nMegan shook her head.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Ive been away you see.",
    "But what do you think\nShe maynt have met that particular man again.",
    "Hed probably\nsheer off if he thought there was a chance of a row but it wouldnt surprise\nme if Betty hadwell been telling Don a few lies again.",
    "You\nsee she did so enjoy dancing and the pictures and of course Don\ncouldnt afford to take her all the time.",
    "If so is she likely to have confided in any one The girl at the cafe\nfor instance\nI dont think thats likely.",
    "Betty couldnt bear the Higley girl.",
    "She\n\nTHE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS\n59\n\nthought her common.",
    "And the others would be new.",
    "Betty wasnt the\nconfiding sort anyway.",
    "An electric bell trilled sharply above the girls head.",
    "She went to the window and leaned out.",
    "She drew back her head\nsharply.",
    "Its Don.. \n\nBring him in here said Poirot quickly.",
    "I would like a word with\nhim before our good inspector takes him in hand.",
    "Like a flash Megan Bamard was out of the kitchen and a couple of\nseconds later she was back again leading Donald Fraser by the hand.",
    "XII.",
    "Donald Fraser\n\nI felt sorry at once for the young man.",
    "His white haggard face and bewildered\neyes showed how great a shock he had had.",
    "He was a wellmade finelooking young fellow standing close on\nsix foot not goodlooking but with a pleasant freckled face high\ncheekbones and flaming red hair.",
    "Whats this Megan he said.",
    "Why in here For Gods sake tell\n\n\fmeIve only just heardBetty...\n\nHis voice trailed away.",
    "Poirot pushed forward a chair and he sank down on it.",
    "My friend then extracted a small flask from his pocket poured some\nof its contents into a convenient cup which was hanging on the dresser\nand said\n\nDrink some of this Mr. Fraser.",
    "It will do you good.",
    "The young man obeyed.",
    "The brandy brought a little colour back into\nhis face.",
    "He sat up straighter and turned once more to the girl.",
    "His manner\nwas quite quiet and selfcontrolled.",
    "Its true I suppose he said.",
    "Betty isdeadkilled\n\nIts true Don.",
    "He said as though mechanically\n\nHave you just come down from London\n\nYes.",
    "Dad phoned me.",
    "By the 920 I suppose said Donald Fraser.",
    "THE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS\n\nHis mind shrinking from reality ran for safety along these unimportant\ndetails.",
    "Yes.",
    "There was silence for a minute or two then Fraser said\nThe police Are they doing anything\nTheyre upstairs now.",
    "Looking through Bettys things I suppose.",
    "Theyve no idea who They dont know.",
    "He stopped.",
    "He had all a sensitive shy persons dislike of putting violent facts\ninto words.",
    "Poirot moved forward a little and asked a question.",
    "He spoke in a\nbusinesslike matteroffact voice as though what he asked was an unimpoctant\ndetail.",
    "Did Miss Barnard tell you where she was going last night.",
    "Fraser replied to the question.",
    "He seemed to be speaking mechanically.",
    "She told me she was going with a girl friend to St. Leonards.",
    "Did you believe her\nI Suddenly the automaton came to life.",
    "What the devil do you\nmean\nHis face then menacing convulsed by sudden passion made me\n\n\funderstand that a girl might well be afraid of rousing his anger.",
    "Poirot said crisply\nBetty Barnard was killed by a homicidal murderer.",
    "Only by speaking\nthe exact truth can you help us to get on his track.",
    "His glance for a minute turned to Megan.",
    "Thats right Don she said.",
    "It isnt a time for considering ones\nown feelings or any one elses.",
    "Youve got to come clean.",
    "Donald Fraser looked suspiciously at Poirot.",
    "Who are you You dont belong to the police\nI am better than the police said Poirot.",
    "He said it without conscious\narrogance.",
    "It was to him a simple statement of fact.",
    "Tell him said Megan.",
    "Donald Fraser capitulated.",
    "Iwasnt sure he said.",
    "I believed her when she said it.",
    "Never\nthought of doing anything else.",
    "Afterwardsperhaps it was something\nin her manner.",
    "II well I began to wonder.",
    "Yes.",
    "said Poirot.",
    "He had sat down opposite Donald Fraser.",
    "His eyes fixed on the\nother mans seemed to be exercising a mesmeric spell.",
    "I was ashamed of myself for being so suspicious.",
    "Butbut I was\n\n69\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\n\fsuspicious...",
    "I thought of going down to the front and watching her\n\nwhen she left the cafe.",
    "I actually went there.",
    "Then I felt I couldnt do\n\nthat.",
    "Betty would see me and shed be angry.",
    "Shed realize at once that\n\nl was watching her.",
    "What did you do\n\nI went over to St. Leonards.",
    "Got over there by eight oclock.",
    "Then\nI watched the busesto see if she were in them\n\nBut\n\nthere was no\nsign\nof her....\nAnd\nthen\nlI\nlost my head rather.",
    "I was convinced she was with some man.",
    "I\nthought it probable he had taken her in his car to Hastings.",
    "I went on therelooked\nin hotels and restaurants hung round cinemaswent on\nthe pier.",
    "All damn foolishness.",
    "Even if she was there I was unlikely to\nfind her and anyway there were heaps of other places he might have taken\nher to instead of Hastings.",
    "He\nstopped.",
    "Precise as his tone had remained I caught an undertone of\n\n\fthat blind bewildering misery and anger that had possessed him at the\ntime he described.",
    "In\nthe end I gave it upcame back.",
    "At\nwhat time\nI\ndont know.",
    "I walked.",
    "It must have been midnight or after when l\ngot\nhome \nThen\nThe\nkitchen\ndoor opened.",
    "Oh there\nyou are said Inspector Kelsey.",
    "Inspector Crome\npushed past him shot a glance at Poirot and a glance at\nthe two strangers.",
    "Miss\nMegan Barnard and Mr. Donald Fraser said Poirot introducing\nthem.",
    "This\nis Inspector Crome from London he explained.",
    "Turning\n\n\fto the inspector he said\nWhile\nyou pursued your investigations upstairs I have been conversing\nwith Miss Barnard and Mr. Fraser endeavouring if I could to find\nsomething that will throw light upon the matter.",
    "Oh\nyes said Inspector Crome his thoughts not upon Poirot but upon\nthe two newcomers.",
    "Poirot\nretreated to the hall.",
    "Inspector Kelsey said kindly as he passed\nGet\nanything\nBut\nhis attention was distracted by his colleague and he did not wait for\na reply.",
    "THE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS\n63\n\nI joined Poirot in the hall.",
    "Did anything strike you Poirot.",
    "I inquired.",
    "Only the amazing magnanimity of the murderer Hastings.",

    "Official conferences.",
    "Unofficial conferences.",
    "This particular conference was to decide whether or not the facts\nrelative to the anonymous letters should or should not be made public\nin the press.",
    "The Bexhill murder had attracted much more attention than the Andover\none.",
    "It had of course far more elements of popularity.",
    "The victim was a\nyoung and goodlooking girl to begin with.",
    "Also it had taken place at a\npopular seaside resort.",
    "All the details of the crime were reported fully and rehashed daily in\nthin disguises.",
    "The A.B.C.",
    "railway guide came in for its share of attention.",
    "The favourite theory was that it had been bought locally by the\nmurderer and that it was a valuable clue to his identity.",
    "It also seemed\nto show that he had come to the place by train and was intending to\nleave for London.",
    "The railway guide had not figured at all in the meagre accounts of\nthe Andover murder so there seemed at present little likelihood of the\ntwo crimes being connected in the public eye.",
    "Weve got to decide upon a policy said the Assistant Commis\n\nTHE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS 65\n\nsioner.",

    "looking out for sales of A.B.C.sand so on.",
    "Against that I SUlYpose\ntheres the advantage of working in the darknot letting our man\nknow what were up to but then theres the fact that he knows very well\n\n\fthat we know.",
    "Hes drawn attention to himself deliberately by his letters.",
    "Eh Crome whats your opinion\n\nI look at it this way sir.",
    "If you make it public youre playing\nA.B.C.",

    "Refusing him the publicity hes hankering\nafter.",
    "What about you M. Poirot\n\nPoirot did not speak for a minute.",
    "When he did it was with an air of\nchoosing his words carefully.",
    "It is difficult for me Sir Lionel he said.",
    "I am as you might say\nan interested party.",
    "The challenge was sent to me.",
    "If I say Suppress\nthat factdo not make it public may it not be thought that it is my\nvanity that speaks That I am afraid for my reputation It is difficult\nTo speak outto tell allthat has its advantages.",
    "It is at least a warning\n.... On the other hand I am as convinced as Inspector Crome that\nit is what the murderer wants us to do.",
    "Hm said the Assistant Commissioner rubbing his chin.",
    "He\nlooked across at Dr. Thompson.",
    "Suppose we refuse our lunatic the\nsatisfaction of the publicity he craves.",
    "Whats he likely to do\n\nCommit another crime said the doctor promptly.",
    "Force your\nhand.",

    "Then whats his reaction\n\nSame answer.",
    "One way you feed his megalomania the other you\n\nbaulk it.",
    "The results the same.",
    "Another crime.",
    "What do you say M. Poirot\nI agree with Dr. Thompson.",
    "A cleft stickeh How many crimes do you think thislunatic\nhas in mind\n\nDr. Thompson looked across at Poirot.",
    "66\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nLooks like A to Z he said cheerfully.",
    "Of course he went on he wont get there.",
    "Not nearly.",
    "Youll\nhave him by the heels long before that.",
    "Interesting to know how hed\nhave dealt with the letter X.",
    "He recalled himself guiltily from this\npurely enjoyable speculation.",
    "But youll have him long before that.",
    "G\nor H lets say.",
    "The Assistant Commissioner struck the table with his fist.",
    "My God are you telling me were going to have five more murders\nIt wont be as much as that sir said Inspector Crome.",
    "Trust me.",
    "He spoke with confidence.",
    "Which letter of the alphabet do you place it at inspector asked\nPoirot.",
    "There was a slight ironic note in his voice.",
    "Cromc I thought looked\nat him with a tinge of dislike adulterating the usual calm superiority.",
    "Might get him next time M. Poirot.",
    "At any rate Id guarantee to get\nhim by the time he gets to E\nHe turned to the Assistant Commissioner.",
    "I think Ive got the psychology of the case fairly clear.",
    "Dr. Thompson\nwill correct me if Im wrong.",
    "I take it that every time he brings a\ncrime off his selfconfidence increases about a hundred per cent.",
    "Every\ntime he feels Im cleverthey cant catch meI he becomes so\noverweeningly confident that he also becomes careless.",
    "He exaggerates\nhis own cleverness and every one clses stupidity.",
    "Very soon hell\nbe hardly bothering to take any precautions at all.",
    "Thats right isnt it\ndoctor\nThompson nodded.",
    "Thats usually the case.",
    "In nonmedical terms it couldnt have been\nput better.",
    "You know something about such things M. Poirot.",
    "Dont\nyou agree\nI dont think that Crome liked Thompsons appeal to Poirot.",
    "He considered\nthat he and he only was the expert on this subject.",
    "It is as Inspector Crome says agreed Poirot.",
    "Paranoia murmured the doctor.",
    "Poirot turned to Crome.",
    "Are there any material facts of interest in the Bexhill case\nNothing very definite.",
    "A waiter at the Splendide at Eastbourne recognizes\nthe dead girls photograph as that of a young woman who\ndined there in company with a middleaged man in spectacles.",
    "Its also\nbeen recognized at a roadhouse place called the Scarlet Runner halfway\nbetween Bexhill and London.",

    "We havent been able to trace the\nA.B.C.",
    "Well you seem to be doing all that can be done Crome said the\nAssistant Commissioner.",
    "What do you say M. Poirot Does any line\nof inquiry suggest itself to you\n\n\fPoirot said slowly\nIt seems to me that there is one very important cluethe discovery\nof the motive.",
    "Isnt that pretty obvious An alphabetical complex.",
    "Isnt that what\nyou called it doctor\na oui said Poirot.",
    "There is an alphabetical complex.",
    "A madman\nin particular has always a very strong reason for the crimes he\ncommits.",
    "Come come M. Poirot said Crome.",
    "Look at Stoneman in 1929.",
    "He ended by trying to do away with any one who annoyed him in the\nslightest degree.",
    "Poirot turned to him.",
    "Quite so.",
    "But if you are a sufficiently great and important person it\nis necessary that you should be spared small annoyances.",
    "If a fly settles\non your forehead again and again maddening you by its ticklingwhat\ndo you do You endeavour to kill that fly.",
    "You have no qualms\nabout it.",
    "You are importantthe fly is not.",
    "You kill the fly and the annoyance\nceases.",
    "Your action appears to you sane and justifiable.",
    "Another\nreason for killing a fly is if you have a strong passion for hygiene.",
    "The fly is a potential source of danger to the communitythe fly must\ngo.",
    "So works the mind of the mentally deranged criminal.",
    "But consider\nnow this caseif the victims are alphabetically selected then they are\nnot being removed because they are a source of annoyance to him personally.",
    "It would be too much of a\ncoincidence to combine the two.",
    "Thats a point said Dr. Thompson.",
    "I remember a case where a\nwomans husband was condemned to death.",
    "She started killing the\n\n\fmembers of the jury one by one.",
    "Quite a time before the crimes were\nconnected up.",
    "They seemed entirely haphazard.",
    "But as M. Poirot says\nthere isnt such a thing as a murderer who commits crimes at random.",
    "Either he removes people who stand however insignificantly in his\npath or else he kills by conviction.",
    "He removes clergymen or policemen\nor prostitutes because he firmly believes that they should be removed.",
    "That doesnt apply here either as far as I can see.",
    "Mrs. Ascher\nand Betty Barnard cannot be linked as members of the same class.",
    "Of\n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\ncourse its possible that there is a sex complex.",
    "Both victims have\nbeen women.",
    "We can tell better of course after the next crime\nFor Gods sake Thompson dont speak so glibly of the next\ncrime said Sir Lionel irritably.",
    "Were going to do all we can to prevent\nanother crime.",
    "Dr. Thompson held his peace and blew his nose with some violence.",
    "Hfive it your own way the noise seemed to say.",
    "If you wont face\nfacts\nThe Assistant Commissioner turned to Poirot.",
    "I see what youre driving at but Im not quite clear yet.",
    "I ask myself said Poirot what passes in itself exactly in the\nmind of the murderer He kills it would seem from his letters pour le\nsportto amuse himself.",
    "Can that really be true And even if it is true\n\n\fon what principle does he select his victims apart from the merely alphabetical\none If he kills merely to amuse himself he would not advertise\nthe fact since otherwise he could kill with impunity.",
    "But no\nhe seeks as we all agree to make the splash in the public eyeto assert\nhis personality.",
    "In what way has his personality been suppressed\nthat one can connect with the two victims he has so far selected A final\nsuggestionIs his motive direct personal hatred of me of Hercule\nPoirot Does he challenge me in public because I have unknown to\nmyself vanquished him somewhere in the course of my career Or is\nhis animosity impersonaldirected against a foreigner And if so\nwhat again has led to that What injury has he suffered at a foreigners\nhand\nAll very suggestive questions said Dr. Thompson.",
    "Inspector Crome cleared his throat.",
    "Oh yes A little unanswerable at present perhaps.",
    "Nevertheless my friend said Poirot looking straight at him it is\nthere in those questions that the solution lies.",
    "If we knew the exact\nreasonfantastic perhaps to usbut logical to himof why our\nbadman commits these crimes we should know perhaps who the\nnext victim is likely to be.",
    "Crome shook his head.",
    "He selects them haphazardthats my opinion.",

    "All\nthe same I dont think that that is our fellows reason.",
    "He wants the\ncredit of these crimes for his own honour and glory.",
    "Thats the explanation\nthat fits best.",
    "Weve come to no decision about the publicity business said the\nAssistant Commissioner.",
    "If I may make a suggestion sir said Crome.",
    "Why not wait fill the\nreceipt of the next letter Make it public thenspecial editions etc.",
    "It\nwill make a bit of a panic in the particular town named but it will put\nevery one whose name begins with C on his guard and itll put A.B.C.",

    "He had the resolute competent manner of a man accustomed to\nmeeting with emergencies.",
    "Goodmorning gentlemen.",

    "This is Inspector Crome of the C.I.D.",
    "Mr. Hercule Poirot anderCaptain\nHayter.",
    "Hastings I corrected coldly.",

    "Let me offer you some breakfast he said.",
    "We can discuss the position\nas we eat.",
    "There were no dissentient voices and we were soon doing justice to\nexcellent eggs and bacon and coffee.",
    "Now for it said Franklin Clarke.",
    "Inspector Wells gave me a\nrough idea of the position last nightthough I may say it seemed one\nof the wildest tales I have ever heard.",
    "Am I really to believe Inspector\nCrome that my poor brother is the victim of a homicidal maniac that\nthis is the third murder that has occurred and that in each case an\nA.B.C.",
    "railway guide has been deposited beside the body\n\n\fThat is substantially the position Mr. Clarke.",
    "But why What earthly benefit can accrue from such a crimeeven in the most diseased imagination\nPoirot nodded his head in approval.",
    "You go straight to the point Mr. Clarke he said.",
    "Its not much good looking for motives at this stage Mr. Clarke\nsaid Inspector Crome.",
    "Thats a matter for an alienistthough I may\nsay that Ive had a certain experience of criminal lunacy and that the\nmotives are usually grossly inadequate.",
    "There is a desire to assert ones\npersonality to make a splash in the public eyein fact to be a somebody\ninstead of a nonentity.",
    "AGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nIs that true M. Poirot\n\nClarke seemed incredulous.",
    "His appeal to the older man was not too\n\nwell received by Inspector Crome who frowned.",
    "Absolutely true replied my friend.",
    "At any rate such a man cannot escape detection long said Clarke\n\n\fthoughtfully.",
    "Vous croyez  Ah but they are cunningces gens lit.t And you must\nremember such a type has usually all the outer signs of\ninsignificancehe belongs to the class of person who is usually\npassed over and ignored or even laughed at\n\nWill you let me have a few facts please Mr. Clarke said Crome\n\nbreaking in on the conversation.",
    "Certainly.",
    "Your brother I take it was in his usual health and spirits yesterday\n\nHe received no unexpected letters Nothing to upset him\nNo.",
    "I should say he was quite his usual self.",
    "Not upset and worded in any way\n\nExcuse me inspector.",
    "I didnt say that.",
    "To be upset and worried\n\nwas my poor brothers normal condition.",
    "Why was that\n\nYou may not know that my sisterinlaw Lady Clarke is in very\n\n\fbad health.",
    "Frankly between ourselves she is suffering from an incurable\ncancer and cannot live very much longer.",
    "Her illness has preyed\nterribly on my brothers mind.",
    "I myself returned from the East not long\n\nago and I was shocked at the change in him.",
    "Poirot interpolated a question.",
    "Supposing Mr. Clarke that your brother had been found shot at\nthe foot of a cliffor shot with a revolver beside him.",
    "What would\nhave been your first thought\n\nQuite frankly I should have jumped to the conclusion that it was\nsuicide said Clarke.",
    "Encore.t said Poirot.",
    "What is thatT\n\nA fact that repeats itselfi It is of no matter.",
    "Anyway it wasnt suicide said Crome with a touch of curtness.",
    "Now I believe Mr. Clarke that it was your brothers habit to go for a\nstroll every evening\n\n\fQuite right.",
    "He always did.",
    "Every night\n\nWell not if it was pouring with rain naturally.",
    "And every one in the house knew of this habit\n\nOf course.",
    "And outside\nI dont quite know what you mean by outside.",
    "The gardener may\nhave been aware of it or not I dont know.",
    "And in the village.9\nStrictly speaking we havent got a village.",
    "Theres a post office\nand cottages at Churston Fettersbut theres no village or shops.",
    "I suppose a stranger hanging round the place would be fairly easily\nnoticed\nOn the contrary.",
    "In August all this part of the world is a seething\nmass of strangers.",
    "They come over every day from Brixham and\nIiTorquay and Paignton in cars and buses and on foot.",
    "Broadsands\nwhich is down there he pointed is a very popular beach and so is\nElbury Coveit s a wellknown beauty spot and people come there\nand picnic.",
    "I wish they didnt Youve no idea how beautiful and\npeaceful this part of the world is in June and the beginning of July.",
    "So you dont think a stranger would be noticed\n\n\fNot unless he lookedwell off his head.",
    "This man doesnt look off his head said Crome with certainty.",
    "You see what Im getting at Mr. Clarke.",
    "This man must have been\nspying out the land beforehand and discovered your brothers habit of\ntaking an evening stroll.",
    "I suppose by the way that no strange man\ncame up to the house and asked to see Sir Carmichael yesterday\nNot that I know ofbat well ask Deveril.",
    "He rang the bell and put the question to the butler.",
    "No sir no one came to see Sir Carmicbael.",
    "And I didnt notice any\none hanging about the house either.",
    "No more did the maids because\nIve asked them.",
    "The butler waited a moment then inquired Is that all sir.",
    "Yes Deveril you can go.",
    "The butler withdrew drawing back in the doorway to let a young\nwoman pass.",
    "Franklin Clarke rose as she came.",
    "This is Miss Grey gentlemen.",
    "My brothers secretary.",
    "My attention was caught at once by the girls extraordinary Scandinavian\nfairness.",
    "She had the almost colourless ash hairlight grey\ne.yesand transparent glowing pallor that one finds amongst Norwegians\nand Swedes.",
    "She looked about twentyseven and seemed to be as\nefficient as she was decorative.",
    "Can I help you in any way.9 she asked as she sat down.",
    "Clarke brought her a cup of coffee but she refused any food.",
    "80\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nDid you deal with Sir Carmichaels correspondence asked\nCrome.",
    "Yes all of it.",
    "I suppose he never received a letter or letters signed A.B.C.",
    "A.B.C.T She shook her head.",
    "No Im sure he didnt.",
    "He didnt mention having seen any one hanging about during his\nevening walks lately\n\nNo.",
    "He never mentioned anything of the kind.",
    "And you yourself have noticed no strangers\n\nNot exactly hanging about.",
    "Of course there are a lot of people\nwhat you might call wandering about at this time of year.",
    "One often\nmeets people strolling with an aimless look across the golf links or\ndown the lanes to the sea.",
    "In the same way practically every one one\n\nsees this time of year is a stranger.",
    "Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Inspector Crome asked to be taken over the ground of Sir\nCarmichaels nightly walk.",
    "Franklin Clarke led the way through the\n\nFrench window and Miss Grey accompanied us.",
    "She and I were a little behind the others.",
    "All this must have been a terrible shock to you all I said.",
    "It seems quite unbelievable.",
    "I had gone to bed last night when the\npolice rang up.",
    "I heard voices downstairs and at last I came out and\nasked what was the matter.",
    "Deveril and Mr. Clarke were just setting\nout with lanterns.",
    "What time did Sir Carmichael usually come back from his walk\nAbout a quarter to ten.",
    "He used to let himself in by the side door\nand then sometimes he went straight to bed sometimes to the gallery\nwhere his collections were.",
    "That is why unless the police had rung up\nhe would probably not have been missed till they went to call him this\nmorning.",
    "It must have been a terrible shock to his wife\n\n\fLady Clarke is kept under morphia a good deal.",
    "I think she is in too\ndazed a condition to appreciate what goes on round her.",
    "We had come out through a garden gate on to the golf links.",
    "Crossing\na corner of them we passed over a stile into a steep winding lane.",
    "This leads down to Elbury Cove explained Franklin Clarke.",
    "But\ntwo years ago they made a new road leading from the main road to\nBroadsands and on to Elbury so that now this lane is practically deserted.",
    "We went on down the lane.",
    "At the foot of it a path led between brambles\nand bracken down to the sea.",
    "Suddenly we came out on a grassy\n\nTHE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS 81\n\nridge overlooking the sea and a beach of glistening white stones.",
    "All\nround dark green trees ran down to the sea.",
    "It was an enchanting\nspotwhite deep greenand sapphire blue.",
    "How beautiful I exclaimed.",
    "Clarke turned to me eagerly.",
    "Isnt it Why people want to go abroad to the Riviera when theyve\ngot this Ive wandered all over the world in my time and honest to\nGod Ive never seen anything as beautiful.",
    "Then as though ashamed of his eagerness he said in a more matteroffact\n\n\ftone\nThis was my brothers evening walk.",
    "He came as far as here then\nback up the path and turning to the right instead of the left went past the farm and across the fields\nback to the house.",
    "We proceeded on our way till we came to a spot near the hedge halfway\nacross the field where the body had been found.",
    "Crome nodded.",
    "Easy enough.",
    "The man stood here in the shadow.",
    "Your brother\nwould have noticed nothing till the blow fell.",
    "The girl at my side gave a quick shiver.",
    "Franklin Clarke said\nHold up Thora.",
    "Its pretty beastly but its no use shirking facts.",
    "Thora Greythe name suited her.",
    "We went back to the house where the body had been taken after being\nphotographed.",
    "As we mounted the wide staircase the doctor came out of a room\nblack hag in hand.",
    "Anything to tell us doctor inquired Clarke.",
    "The doctor shook his head.",
    "Perfectly simple case.",
    "Ill keep the technicalities for the inquest.",
    "Anyway he didnt suffer.",
    "Death must have been instantaneous.",
    "He moved away.",
    "Ill just go in and see Lady Clarke.",
    "A hospital nurse came out of a room further along the corridor and\nthe doctor joined her.",
    "We went into the room out of which the doctor had come.",
    "I came out again rather quickly.",
    "Thora Grey was still standing at the\n\n\fhead of the stairs.",
    "There was a queer scared expression on her face.",
    "Miss Grey I stopped.",
    "Is anything the matter\nShe looked at me.",
    "I was thinking she saidabout D.\n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nAbout D I stared at her stupidly.",
    "Yes.",
    "The next murder.",
    "Something must be done.",
    "Its got to be\nstopped.",
    "Clarke came out of the room behind me.",
    "He said\nWhats got to be stopped Thora\nThese awful murders.",
    "Yes.",
    "His jaw thrust itself out aggressively.",
    "I want to talk to\nM. Poirot sometime\n\nIs\n\nCrome any good He shot the words out\nunexpectedly.",
    "I\nreplied that he was supposed to be a very clever officer.",
    "My\nvoice was perhaps not as enthusiastic as it might have been.",
    "Hes\ngot a damned offensive manner said Clarke.",
    "Looks as though\n\n\fhe knows everythingand what does he know Nothing at all as\nfar as I can make out.",
    "He\nwas silent for a minute or two.",
    "Then he said\nM.\nPoirots the man for my money.",
    "Ive got a plan.",
    "But well talk of that\nlater.",
    "He\nwent along the passage and tapped at the same door as the doctor had\nentered.",
    "I\nhesitated a moment.",
    "The girl was staring in front of her.",
    "What\nare you thinking of Miss GreyT She\nturned her eyes towards me.",
    "Im\nwondering where he is now.. the murderer I mean.",
    "Its not twelve\nhours yet since it happened .... Oh arent there any real clairvoyants\n\nwho could see where he is now and what he is doing...  \nhe police are searching I\nbegan.",
    "My commonplace words broke the spell.",
    "Thora Grey pulled\nherself\ntogether.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "Of\ncourse.",
    "In her turn she descended the staircase.",

    "case.",
    "Some\nof them were harmless lunatics some of them were wellmeaning persons\nwho genuinely believed that their information was of value.",
    "It\nwas the duty of Sergeant Jacobs to act as a human sieveretaining the\ngrosset matter and passing on the residue to his superior.",
    "Very well Jacobs said Crome.",
    "Send him along.",
    "A few minutes later there was a tap on the inspectors door and Sergeant\nJacobs appeared ushering in a tall moderately goodlooking\nyoung man.",
    "This is Mr. Torn Hartigan sir.",
    "Hes got something to tell us which\nmay have a possible bearing on the A.B.C.",
    "case.",

    "Goodmorning Mr. Hartigan.",

    "The appearance\nof the inspector vaguely disappointed him.",
    "He looked quite an ordinary\nperson I\n141\n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\nNow then said Crome.",
    "Youve got something to tell us that ou\nthink may have a bearing on the case.",
    "Fire ahead.",
    "Torn began nervously.",
    "Of course it may be nothing at all.",
    "Its just an idea of mine.",
    "I may\nbe wasting your time.",
    "Again Inspector Crome sighed imperceptibly.",
    "The amount of time\nhe had to waste in reassuring people\nWere the best judge of that.",
    "Lets have the facts Mr. Hartigan.",
    "Well its like this sir.",
    "Ive got a young lady you see and her\nmother lets rooms.",
    "Up Camden Town way.",
    "Their second floor back has\nbeen let for over a year to a man called Cust.",
    "Custeh\nThats fight sir.",
    "A sort of middleaged bloke whats rather vague\nand softand come down in the world a bit I should say.",
    "Sort of creature\n\n\fwho wouldnt hurt a fly youd sayand Id never of dreamed of\nanything being wrong if it hadnt been for something rather odd.",
    "In a somewhat confused manner and repeating himself once or\ntwice Torn described his encounter with Mr. Cust at Euston Station\nand the incident of the dropped ticket.",
    "You see sir look at it how you will its funny like.",
    "Lily thats my\nyoung lady sirshe was quite positive that it was Cheltenham he said\nand her mother says the samesays she remembers distinct talking\nabout it the morning he went off.",
    "Of course I didnt pay much attention\nto it at the time.",
    "Lilymy young lady said as how she hoped he\nwouldnt cop it for this A.B.C.",
    "fellow going to Doncasterand then\nshe says its rather a coincidence because he was down Churston way\nat the time of the last crime.",
    "Laughing like I asks her whether he was\nat Bexhill the time before and she says she dont know where he was\nbut he was away at the seasidethat she does know.",
    "And then I said t\nher it would be odd if he was the A.B.C.",
    "himself and she said poor Mr.\nCust wouldnt hurt a flyand that was all at the time.",
    "We didnt think\nno more about it.",
    "At least in a sort of way I did sir underneath like.",
    "I\nbegan wondering about this Cust fellow and thinking that after all\nharmless as he seemed he might be a bit batty.",
    "Torn took a breath and then went on.",
    "Inspector Crome was listening\nintently now.",
    "And then after the Doncaster murder sir it was in all the papers\nthat information was wanted as to the whereabouts of a certain A.B.",
    "Case or Cash and it gave a description that fitted well enough.",
    "First\n\n\fevening off I had I went round to Lilys and asked her what her Mr.\nCusts initials were.",
    "She couldnt remember at first but her mother did.",
    "THE A.B.C.",
    "MURDERS \n\nSaid they were A.B.",
    "right enough.",
    "Then we got down to it and tried to\nfigure out if Cust had been away at the time of the first murder at Andover.",
    "Well as you know sir it isnt too easy to remember things three\nmonths back.",
    "We had a job of it but we got it fixed down in the end\nbecause Mrs. Marbury had a brother come from Canada to see her on\nJune 21st.",
    "He arrived unexpected like and she wanted to give him a\nbed and Lily suggested that as Mr. Cust was away Bert Marbury might\nhave his bed.",
    "But Mrs. Marbury wouldnt agree because she said it\nwasnt acting right by her lodger and she always liked to act fair and\nsquare.",
    "But we fixed the date all right because of Bert Marburys ship\ndocking at Southampton that day.",
    "Inspector Crome had listened very attentively jotting down an occasional\nnote.",
    "Thats all.",
    "he asked.",
    "Thats all sir.",
    "I hope you dont think Im making a lot of nothing.",
    "Torn flushed slightly.",
    "Not at all.",
    "You were quite right to come here.",
    "Of course its very\nslight evidencethese dates may be mere coincidence and the likeness\nof the name too.",
    "But it certainly warrants my having an interview\nwith your Mr. Cust.",
    "Is he at home now\nYes sir.",
    "When did he return.",
    "The evening of the Doncaster murder sir.",
    "Whats he been doing sine.",
    "cT\nHes stayed in mostly sir.",
    "And hes been looking very queer Mrs.\nMarbury says.",
    "He buys a lot of newspapersgoes out early and gets\nthe morning ones and then after dark he goes out and gets the evening\nones.",
    "Mrs. Marbury says he talks a lot to himself too.",
    "She thinks hes\ngetting queerer.",
    "What is this Mrs. Marburys address\nTorn gave it to him.",
    "\u00b0lrhank you.",
    "I shall probably be calling round in the course of the\nday.",
    "I need hardly tell you to be careful of your manner if you come\nacross this Cust.",
    "He rose and shook hands.",
    "You may he quite satisfied you did the fight thing in coming to us.",
    "Goodmorning Mr. Hartigan.",
    "Well sir asked Jacobs reentering the room a few minutes later.",
    "Think its the goods\nIts promising said Inspector Crome.",
    "That is if the facts are as\nthe boy stated them.",
    "Weve had no luck with the stocking manufactur\n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE\n\ners yet.",
    "It was time we got hold of something.",
    "By the way give me that\n\n\ffile of the Churston case.",
    "He spent some minutes looking for what he wanted.",
    "Ah here it is.",
    "Its amongst the statements made to the Torquay\nlice.",
    "Young man of the name of Hill.",
    "Deposes he was leaving\nTorquay Pavilion after the film Not a Sparrow and noticed a man behaving\nqueerly.",
    "He was talking to himself.",
    "Hill heard him say Thats\nan idea.",
    "Not a Sparrowthats the film that was on at the Regal in\nDoncasterT\nYes sir.",
    "There may be something in that.",
    "Nothing to it at the timebut its\npossible that the idea of the modus operandi for his next crime occurred\nto our man then.",
    "Weve got Hills name and address I see.",
    "His\ndescription of the man is vague but it links up well enough with the\nscriptions of Mary Stroud and this Torn Hartigan ....",
    "He nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Were getting warm said Inspector Cromerather inaccurately\nfor he himself was always slightly chilly.",
    "Any instructions sir\nPut on a couple of men to watch this Camden Town address but I\ndont want our bird frightened.",
    "I must have a word with the A.C. Then\nI think it would be as well if Cust was brought along here and asked if\nhed like to make a statement.",
    "It sounds as though hes quite ready to\nget rattled.",
    "Outside Torn Hartigan had rejoined Lily Marbury who was waiting\nfor him on the Embankmenf.",
    "All right Torn Torn nodded.",
    "I saw Inspector Crome himself.",
    "The one whos in charge of\ncase.",

    "Thats Lord Trenchards new kind said Lily with respect.",
    "Sorc\nof them are ever so grand.",
    "Well what did he say Torn gave her a brief rsum of the interview.",
    "So they think as it really was him\nThey think it might be.",
    "Anyway theyll come along and ask hiia a\nquestion or two.",

    "Oh Torn.",
    "Lily squeezed his arm in an ecstasy.",
    "And in the meantime what do you say to a bite at the Corner\n\n\fHouse\nLily squeezed tighter.",
    "Come on then\nAll righthalf a minute.",

    "I dont suppose they meant it seriously she thought comfortably.",
    "And now I hope theyll be ashamed of themselves.",
    "In some obscure way that she could not have explained Mr. Custs\nstatement that his sister had had a baby had effectually removed any\ndoubts Mrs. Marbury might have had of her lodgers bonafides.",
