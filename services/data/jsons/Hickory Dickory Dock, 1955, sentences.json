    "\fCHAPTER ONE\nHercule Poirot frowned.",
    "Miss Lemon he said.",
    "Yes Monsieur Poirot\nThere are three mistakes in this letter.",
    "He sounded shocked.",
    "Miss Lemon a proud and professional woman never\nmade mistakes.",
    "She was never ill never tired never upset never inaccurate.",
    "Order and method had been Hercule Poirots favourite words for many years.",
    "With George his perfect manservant and Miss Lemon his perfect secretary\norder and method shaped his life.",
    "And yet this morning Miss Lemon had made three mistakes in typing a\nvery simple letter.",
    "The world had stopped turning.",
    "Hercule Poirot held out the offending document.",
    "He was not annoyed he\nwas just confused.",
    "This was something that just could not happen  but it had\nMiss Lemon took the letter.",
    "Oh dear I cant think how I did that  well\nperhaps I can.",
    "Its because of my sister.",
    "Your sister Another shock.",
    "Poirot had never known that Miss Lemon had\na sister.",
    "Miss Lemon nodded.",
    "Yes most of her life she has lived in Singapore.",
    "Her\nhusband was in the rubber business there but he died four years ago.",
    "There were\nno children so when she came back to England I found a very nice little flat for\nher but  Miss Lemon paused.",
    "Well she was lonely and she told me that she was\nthinking about taking a job.",
    "Job\nLooking after a hostel for students.",
    "It is owned by a woman who is partly\nGreek and she wanted someone to manage it for her.",
    "Its a big old house and my\nsister was going to have a very nice flat \n\n\fMiss Lemon stopped and Poirot made an encouraging noise for her to\ncontinue.",
    "I wasnt sure about it but my sister likes to be busy and shes always been\ngood with young people.",
    "So your sister took the job Poirot asked.",
    "Yes she moved into 26 Hickory Road about six months ago and she liked\nher work there.",
    "Hercule Poirot listened.",
    "So far the story of Miss Lemons sister had been\ndisappointingly ordinary.",
    "But for some time now shes been very worried.",
    "Why\nWell Monsieur Poirot she doesnt like the things that are going on there.",
    "There are students there of both sexes Poirot inquired delicately.",
    "Oh no I dont mean that One always expects difficulties of that kind No\nbut things have been disappearing.",
    "Disappearing\nYes.",
    "And such odd things... And all in rather a strange way.",
    "When you say things have been disappearing you mean things have been\nstolen\nYes.",
    "Have the police been called in\nNo.",
    "My sister is fond of these young people  well of some of them  and\nshe would prefer to straighten things out by herself.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "I can understand that.",
    "But that does not explain if I may\nsay so your own anxiety.",
    "I cannot help feeling that something is going on which I do not\nunderstand.",
    "No ordinary explanation seems to fit with the facts.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Not an ordinary thief A kleptomaniac perhaps\nI do not think so.",
    "I read about the subject in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.",
    "But I was not persuaded.",
    "Hercule Poirot was silent for a minute and a half.",
    "Did he wish to involve\nhimself in the troubles of Miss Lemons sister But it was very inconvenient to\nhave Miss Lemon making mistakes in his letters.",
    "He told himself that if he were\nto involve himself that would be the reason.",
    "He did not admit to himself that he\nhad been rather bored lately.",
    "Supposing Miss Lemon you were to invite your sister here for afternoon\ntea I might be able to be of some small help to her.",
    "Thats very kind of you Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Then shall we say tomorrow\n\n\fCHAPTER TWO\nMiss Lemons sister Mrs Hubbard looked very like her.",
    "She was a little\nfatter her hair was more stylish and she was gentler in manner but her eyes\nwere the same sharp eyes that shone through Miss Lemons glasses.",
    "This is very kind of you Monsieur Poirot she said.",
    "Very kind.",
    "And such\na wonderful tea too.",
    "First we enjoy our tea  afterwards we talk business.",
    "Poirot smiled at her\nand stroked his moustache.",
    "Can you explain to me exactly what worries you\nYes I can.",
    "It would be natural for money to be taken.",
    "And jewellery thats natural too  well I dont really mean natural  but it would make sense.",
    "So\nIll just read you a list of the things that have been taken.",
    "Mrs Hubbard opened\nher bag and took out a small notebook.",
    "Evening shoe one of a new pair\nBracelet cheap\nDiamond ring found in a plate of soup\nPowder compact Lipstick Stethoscope Old grey trousers Electric light\nbulbs Box of chocolates Silk scarf cut to pieces\nRucksack cut to pieces\nBoracic powder Bath salts Cookery book\nHercule Poirot took a long deep breath.",
    "Very  very interesting.",
    "I\ncongratulate you Mrs Hubbard.",
    "She looked surprised.",
    "But why Monsieur Poirot\nI congratulate you on having such an unusual and beautiful problem.",
    "Well perhaps it makes sense to you Monsieur Poirot but \n\n\fIt does not make sense at all.",
    "Why was such a strange collection of things\nstolen Is there any system there The first thing to do is to study the list of\nobjects very carefully.",
    "There was a silence while Poirot did this.",
    "When he finally spoke Mrs\nHubbard jumped.",
    "The first thing that I notice is this said Poirot.",
    "Most of the things were of\nsmall value except for two  a stethoscope and a ring.",
    "Forget the stethoscope for\na moment I would like to concentrate on the ring.",
    "You say a diamond ring\nYes it had been Miss Lanes mothers engagement ring.",
    "She was most\nupset when it was missing and we were all relieved when it reappeared the same\nevening in Miss Hobhouses plate of soup.",
    "Just an unpleasant joke we thought.",
    "And so it may have been.",
    "But I myself think for someone to steal the ring\nand then return it is important.",
    "If a lipstick or a powder compact or a book are\nmissing you do not call in the police.",
    "But a diamond ring is different.",
    "It is very\nlikely that the police will be called in.",
    "So the ring is returned.",
    "But why take it if youre going to return it said Miss Lemon.",
    "That is a\ngood question said Poirot.",
    "But for the moment we will forget questions.",
    "I am\nconcentrating now on the objects.",
    "Who is this Miss Lane from whom the ring\nwas stolen\nPatricia Lane Shes a very nice girl whos studying History.",
    "Rich\nShes got a little money but she doesnt have many new clothes.",
    "What is she like\nWell shes neither dark nor fair and rather quiet.",
    "A serious type of girl.",
    "And the ring was found in Miss Hobhouses plate of soup.",
    "Who is Miss\nHobhouse\nValerie Hobhouse Shes a clever girl with dark hair and rather a sharp\nmanner.",
    "She works in a beauty salon Sabrina Fair.",
    "Are these two girls friendly\nMrs Hubbard thought.",
    "I think so  Patricia gets on well with everybody\nreally.",
    "Valerie has her enemies but shes got her admirers too if you know what\nI mean.",
    "I think I know said Poirot.",
    "He looked at the list again.",
    "What is so\ninteresting is the different groups of things.",
    "There are the cheap articles and then\nwe have the stethoscope which someone might want to sell.",
    "Who did it belong\nto\nMr Bateson  hes a big friendly young man.",
    "A medical student\nYes.",
    "Was he very angry\nYes Monsieur Poirot.",
    "And who did the grey trousers belong to\nMr McNabb.",
    "They were very old but Mr McNabb is fond of his old\nclothes and he never throws anything away.",
    "So we have come to the things that seem not worth stealing  old trousers\nlight bulbs boracic powder bath salts  a cookery book.",
    "The boracic was\nprobably taken by mistake the cookery book may have been borrowed and not\nreturned.",
    "Then there is the evening shoe one of a new pair Who do they belong\nto\nSally Finch.",
    "Shes an American girl studying Science over here on a\nscholarship.",
    "She was going to a party in evening dress and the shoes were really\nimportant because they were her only evening shoes.",
    "It was inconvenient  and annoying for her  yes.",
    "Yes perhaps there is\nsomething there...",
    "He was silent for a moment.",
    "And there are two more articles\n a rucksack and a silk scarf both cut to pieces.",
    "Here we have something that\nmay be cruel.",
    "Who did the rucksack belong to\n\n\fNearly all the students have rucksacks and many of them are the same bought at the same place.",
    "But this one belonged to Leonard Bateson.",
    "And the silk scarf.",
    "To whom did that belong\nTo Valerie Hobhouse.",
    "Miss Hobhouse...",
    "I see.",
    "Poirot closed his eyes.",
    "Pieces of silk scarf and rucksack cookery books\nlipsticks names and pictures of students spun round in space.",
    "But Poirot knew\nthat somewhere there must be a pattern...",
    "He opened his eyes.",
    "This is a matter\nthat needs some consideration.",
    "But we might start with practical things.",
    "The\nevening shoe  yes we might start with that.",
    "Miss Lemon Mrs Hubbard will\nobtain for you perhaps the remaining shoe.",
    "Go with it to Baker Street Station\nto the lost property department.",
    "You will say you left a shoe on a bus.",
    "How many\nbuses pass near Hickory Road\nTwo only Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Good.",
    "But why do you think  began Mrs Hubbard.",
    "Poirot interrupted her.",
    "Let us see first what results we get.",
    "Then you and I\nmust talk again.",
    "You will tell me then those things which are necessary for me to\nknow.",
    "I really think Ive told you everything I can.",
    "No no.",
    "Here we have young people all living together different\ncharacters different sexes.",
    "A loves B but B loves C and D and E hate each\nother because of A perhaps.",
    "It is all that I need to know.",
    "Im sure said Mrs Hubbard uncomfortably I dont know anything about\nthat sort of thing.",
    "But you are interested in people.",
    "You will tell me  yes you will tell me\nBecause you are worried  not about what has been happening  you could go to\nthe police about that \n\n\fThe owner Mrs Nicoletis would not like to have the police called in I\ncan tell you that.",
    "Poirot paid no attention to this and continued No you are worried about\nsomeone  someone who you think may have been involved in this.",
    "Someone\ntherefore that you like.",
    "Really Monsieur Poirot\nYes really.",
    "And I think you are right to be worried.",
    "For that silk scarf cut\nto pieces it is not nice.",
    "And the rucksack that also is not nice.",
    "The rest it seems\nlike childishness  and yet  I am not sure.",
    "I am not sure at all\n\n\fCHAPTER THREE\nHurrying up the steps Mrs Hubbard put her key into the door of 26\nHickory Road.",
    "Just as it opened a big young man with red hair ran up behind\nher.",
    "Hallo Ma have you been out having fun\nIve been out to tea Mr Bateson.",
    "I cut up a beautiful dead body today said Len.",
    "That was fun\nA beautiful dead body Really you are awful.",
    "Len Bateson laughed.",
    "A thin young man with untidy hair came out of a room on the right and\nsaid sharply Oh its only you.",
    "I thought because of the noise it must be at least a\ngroup of big men.",
    "I hope it doesnt harm your nerves replied Bateson.",
    "Not more than usual said Nigel Chapman and went back into his room.",
    "Our delicate flower said Len.",
    "Now dont you two quarrel.",
    "said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "I like everyone to be\nfriendly.",
    "The big young man smiled down at her.",
    "I dont mind Nigel Ma.",
    "Oh Mrs Hubbard Mrs Nicoletis is in her room and said she would like to\nsee you as soon as you got back.",
    "A tall dark girl stood against the wall on the\nstairs to let her pass.",
    "Mrs Hubbard sighed and went on up.",
    "Len Bateson said What is it Valerie Complaints about our behaviour\n\n\fI dont know.",
    "The girl came down the stairs.",
    "This place gets more like a\nmadhouse every day.",
    "She went through the door on the right.",
    "In fact 26 Hickory Road was two houses 24 and 26.",
    "They had been made\ninto one on the ground floor so that there was a large sitting room and dining\nroom there.",
    "Two staircases led to the floors above which remained separate.",
    "The\ngirls occupied bedrooms on the righthand side of the house and the men on the\nother the original Number 24.",
    "Upstairs Mrs Hubbard knocked on the door of Mrs Nicoletiss room and\nentered.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis was on the sofa.",
    "She was a big woman still goodlooking\nwith an angrylooking mouth and large brown eyes.",
    "Ah So there you are.",
    "Yes said Mrs Hubbard I was told you wanted to see me.",
    "Yes I do.",
    "It is disgusting\nWhats disgusting\nThese bills Mrs Nicoletis showed her a handful of papers.",
    "What are we\nfeeding these students on Shellfish and champagne Is this the Ritz Hotel\nThey get a good breakfast and a good evening meal  plain healthy food.",
    "It is all very economical.",
    "Economical You dare to say that to me When I am being ruined\nYou make a very good profit.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis.",
    "Bah That Italian cook and her husband.",
    "They cheat you over the food.",
    "Oh no they dont.",
    "I can tell that no one cheats me over anything.",
    "Then it is you yourself  you who are robbing me.",
    "Mrs Hubbard remained calm.",
    "I cant allow you to say things like that.",
    "It is\nnot nice and one day you will be in trouble for it.",
    "Ah Mrs Nicoletis threw the bills up in the air from where they fell to the\n\n\ffloor in all directions.",
    "You admit that these totals are higher than those of last\nweek\nOf course they are.",
    "Mrs Hubbard bent and picked the bills up.",
    "Theres\nbeen some very good cutprice food at Lampsons Stores.",
    "Ive taken advantage of\nit.",
    "Next weeks totals will be below average.",
    "There.",
    "Mrs Hubbard put the bills in\na neat pile on the table.",
    "Anything else\nThe American girl Sally Finch she talks of leaving  I do not want her to\ngo.",
    "She will bring here other American scholars.",
    "She must not leave.",
    "Whats her reason for leaving\nHow can I remember It was not true what she said.",
    "I could tell that.",
    "You\nwill talk to her\nYes of course.",
    "It must be because of the Communists  you know how Americans hate\nCommunists.",
    "Nigel Chapman  he is a Communist.",
    "I doubt it.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "You should have heard what he was saying one evening.",
    "Nigel will say anything to annoy people.",
    "You know them all so well.",
    "Dear Mrs Hubbard you are wonderful I say\nto myself again and again  what would I do without Mrs Hubbard\nWell Ill do what I can.",
    "She left the room and hurried along the passage to\nher own sitting room.",
    "But there was to be no peace for Mrs Hubbard just yet.",
    "As she entered a\ntall figure stood up and said I would like to speak to you for a few minutes\nplease.",
    "Of course Elizabeth.",
    "Mrs Hubbard was rather surprised.",
    "Elizabeth Johnston was a girl from the\n\n\fWest Indies who was studying Law.",
    "She was hardworking and ambitious and\nkept herself to herself but Mrs Hubbard heard a slight shake in her voice.",
    "Will you come with me to my room please\nMrs Hubbard followed her up to the top floor.",
    "Elizabeth opened the door\nof her room and went across to a table near the window.",
    "Here are my work notes.",
    "The result of several months hard study.",
    "You see\nwhat has been done\nMrs Hubbard gasped.",
    "Ink had been spilled on the table.",
    "It had run all over\nthe papers.",
    "Mrs Hubbard touched it with her finger.",
    "It was still wet.",
    "This was done while I was out.",
    "It is not even my own ink.",
    "Somebody\nbrought ink here and did it deliberately.",
    "What a very cruel thing to do.",
    "Elizabeth I am shocked and will do my best\nto find out who did this.",
    "Do you have any ideas about that\nThe girl replied at once.",
    "This is green ink.",
    "Not many people use it but I\nknow one person here who does.",
    "Nigel Chapman.",
    "Nigel Do you think Nigel would do a thing like that\nI dont think so  no.",
    "Well Im very sorry Elizabeth that such a thing has happened in this\nhouse.",
    "Thank you Mrs Hubbard.",
    "There have been  other things havent there\nYes  er  yes.",
    "Mrs Hubbard left the room and started towards the stairs.",
    "But she stopped\nsuddenly and instead went along the passage to a door at the end.",
    "She knocked\nand a voice told her to enter.",
    "The room was a pleasant one and Sally Finch\nherself a cheerful redhead was a pleasant person.",
    "She was writing at a desk and\nlooked up smiling.",
    "Sally have you heard whats happened to Elizabeth Johnston\nWhat has happened to her\nMrs Hubbard told her about the green ink.",
    "Thats an awful thing to do Sally said.",
    "But everybody likes Elizabeth so\nwho... Well it fits in with all the other things.",
    "Thats why \nThats why what\nSally said slowly Thats why Im getting out of here.",
    "Did Mrs Nick tell\nyou\nYes.",
    "She was very upset about it.",
    "Well I just dont like whats going on.",
    "It was strange losing my shoe but\nthen Valeries scarf being all cut to bits and Lens rucksack... Ive a feeling that\ntheres a person in this house who isnt right.",
    "Mrs Hubbard went downstairs to the students common room.",
    "There were\nfour people there Valerie Hobhouse lying on a sofa Nigel Chapman sitting at a\ntable with a heavy book open in front of him Patricia Lane leaning against the\nfireplace and a girl in a coat who was pulling off a woollen hat.",
    "She was a\nshort fair girl with brown eyes and a mouth that was usually a little open so that\nshe always looked surprised.",
    "Something very unpleasant has happened Mrs Hubbard said.",
    "Nigel I\nwant you to help me.",
    "Me Madam Nigel shut his book.",
    "His thin face suddenly lit up with a\nsurprisingly sweet smile.",
    "What have I done\nNothing I hope said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "But ink has been deliberately spilt all\nover Elizabeth Johnstons notes and its green ink.",
    "His smile disappeared.",
    "I use green ink.",
    "Awful stuff said Patricia.",
    "I wish you wouldnt Nigel.",
    "I like being unusual said Nigel.",
    "But are you serious Mum About\nElizabeths papers\nYes I am serious.",
    "Did you do it Nigel\nNo of course not.",
    "I like annoying people but I would never do an\nunpleasant thing like that  and certainly not to Elizabeth.",
    "I usually keep my ink\non the shelf over there.",
    "He got up and went across the room.",
    "The bottles nearly\nempty.",
    "It should be nearly full.",
    "The girl in the coat gasped.",
    "Oh I dont like it \nNigel turned to her.",
    "Have you got an alibi.",
    "Celia\nI didnt do it.",
    "I really didnt.",
    "Ive been at the hospital all day.",
    "I couldnt \nNow Nigel said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "Dont joke with Celia.",
    "Patricia Lane said\nangrily Why do you suspect Nigel Just because his ink was taken \nValerie said Thats right darling defend your little boy.",
    "You know she\nlooked at Mrs Hubbard all this is getting beyond a joke.",
    "Something will have to\nbe done about it.",
    "Something is going to be done said Mrs Hubbard firmly.",
    "CHAPTER FOUR\nHere you are Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Miss Lemon laid a small brown paper\npackage before him.",
    "He removed the paper and looked at a silver evening shoe.",
    "It was at the Lost Property Office just as you said.",
    "That tells us my ideas are correct said Poirot.",
    "And I received a letter from my sister.",
    "There have been some new\ndevelopments.",
    "She handed it to him and after reading it he asked Miss Lemon\nto get her sister on the telephone.",
    "Oh Monsieur Poirot how kind of you to ring me up so quickly.",
    "Mrs Hubbard do you sometimes arrange talks at the hostel or films\nYes sometimes.",
    "Ah.",
    "Then this evening you will have persuaded Monsieur Hercule Poirot\nto come and talk to your students about his more interesting cases.",
    "Dinner was at seventhirty and most of the students were already seated\nwhen Mrs Hubbard came down from her sitting room followed by a small man\nwith surprisingly black hair and a very large moustache.",
    "This is Monsieur Hercule Poirot who is kindly going to talk to us after\ndinner.",
    "Poirot sat down by Mrs Hubbard and busied himself with keeping his\nmoustache out of the excellent soup which was served by an Italian manservant.",
    "This was followed by spaghetti and it was then that a girl sitting on Poirots right\nspoke to him.",
    "Is it true that Mrs Hubbards sister works for you\nBut yes.",
    "Miss Lemon is the most perfect secretary that ever lived.",
    "I am\nsometimes afraid of her.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "I wondered \nNow what did you wonder Mademoiselle He smiled upon her in fatherly\nfashion making a note in his mind as he did so Pretty worried not very clever\nfrightened...",
    "He said May I know your name and what it is you are studying\nCelia Austin.",
    "I dont study.",
    "Im a chemist at St Catherines Hospital.",
    "And these others Can you tell me something about them perhaps\nWell sitting on Mrs Hubbards left is Nigel Chapman.",
    "Hes studying\nItalian at London University.",
    "Then theres Patricia Lane with glasses on next to\nhim.",
    "Shes studying History.",
    "The big redheaded boy is Len Bateson hes a\nmedical student and the dark girl is Valerie Hobhouse she works in a beauty\nshop.",
    "Next to her is Colin McNabb  hes studying Psychology.",
    "There was a\nchange in her voice as she described Colin and her face went slightly pink.",
    "Poirot said to himself So  she is in love.",
    "He noticed that McNabb never\nlooked at her as he was much too interested in his conversation with a laughing\nredheaded girl beside him.",
    "Thats Sally Finch.",
    "Shes American  studying Science.",
    "Then theres\nGenevieve Maricaud.",
    "Shes doing English and the small fair girl is Jean\nTomlinson  shes at the hospital too a physiotherapist.",
    "The black man is\nAkibombo  he comes from West Africa and hes very nice.",
    "Then theres\nElizabeth Johnston shes from Jamaica and shes studying Law.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Do you all get on well together Or do you have quarrels\nPoirot asked lightly.",
    "Celia said Oh were all too busy to have quarrels  although \nAlthough what Miss Austin\nWell  Nigel  he likes making people angry.",
    "And Len Bateson gets angry.",
    "But hes very sweet really.",
    "And Colin McNabb  does he too get annoyed\nOh no.",
    "Colin just looks amused.",
    "I see.",
    "And the young ladies do you have your quarrels\nNo we all get on very well.",
    "Genevieve sometimes...",
    "I think French people\ncan be a bit difficult  oh Im sorry  Celia looked confused.",
    "Me I am Belgian said Poirot and continued.",
    "What did you mean just\nnow when you said that you wondered.",
    "You wondered  what\nOh that  just there have been some silly jokes lately  I thought Mrs\nHubbard perhaps  no I didnt mean anything.",
    "Poirot did not put pressure on her.",
    "He turned to Mrs Hubbard and was soon\nhaving a conversation with her and Nigel Chapman who declared that crime\nwas a form of creative art  and that people only became policemen to express\ntheir secret cruelty.",
    "All you young people nowadays think of nothing but politics and\npsychology Mrs Hubbard said.",
    "When I was a girl we used to dance but you\nnever do.",
    "Patricia Lane said You see Mrs Hubbard with lectures to attend and then\nnotes to write up theres really not time for anything else.",
    "A chocolate pudding followed the spaghetti and afterwards they all went\ninto the common room and Poirot was invited to begin his talk.",
    "He spoke in his\nusual confident way about some of his more entertaining cases exaggerating a\nlittle to amuse his audience.",
    "And so you see he finished prevention always is\nbetter than cure.",
    "We want to prevent murders  not wait until they have been\ncommitted.",
    "The students clapped loudly.",
    "Poirot bowed.",
    "And then as he was about to\nsit down Colin McNabb said And now perhaps youll talk about what youre\nreally here for\nPatricia said Colin\nWell we can guess cant we He looked round.",
    "Monsieur Poirot has\ngiven us a very amusing little talk but thats not what he came here for.",
    "Hes here\nas a working detective.",
    "You dont really think Monsieur Poirot that we dont\nknow that\n\n\fI will admit Poirot said that Mrs Hubbard has told me that certain events\nhave caused her  worry.",
    "Celia gave a frightened gasp.",
    "Then I was right\nMrs Hubbard spoke firmly.",
    "I asked Monsieur Poirot to give us a talk but I\nalso wanted to ask his advice about various things that have happened lately.",
    "Something has got to be done and it seemed to me that the only other possibility\nwas  the police.",
    "At once a violent argument broke out and then in a moment of quiet\nLeonard Batesons voice could be heard.",
    "Lets hear what Monsieur Poirot has to\nsay about these troubles.",
    "Poirot bowed.",
    "Thank you.",
    "As though performing a magic trick he brought\nout a pair of evening shoes and handed them to Sally Finch.",
    "Your shoes\nMademoiselle\nBoth of them Where did the missing one come from\nFrom the Lost Property Office at Baker Street Station.",
    "But why did you think it might be there Monsieur Poirot\nSomeone takes a shoe from your room.",
    "Why Not to wear and not to sell.",
    "And since everyone will try to find it then the shoe must be got out of the house\nor destroyed.",
    "But it is not so easy to destroy a shoe.",
    "The easiest way is to take it\non a bus and leave it under a seat.",
    "He paused.",
    "Monsieur Bateson has asked me\nto say what I myself think of these troubles.",
    "But it would not be right for me to\nspeak unless I am invited to by all of you.",
    "Oh goodness Sally Finch said.",
    "This is a kind of party all friends\ntogether.",
    "Lets hear what Monsieur Poirot advises without any more fuss.",
    "I couldnt agree with you more Sally said Nigel.",
    "Very well Poirot said.",
    "My advice is simple.",
    "Mrs Hubbard  or Mrs\nNicoletis rather  should call in the police at once.",
    "CHAPTER FIVE\nThere was no doubt that Poirots statement was unexpected.",
    "It caused a\nsudden and uncomfortable silence.",
    "Then Poirot was taken by Mrs Hubbard up to\nher sitting room.",
    "You are probably right she said.",
    "Perhaps we should get the\npolice in  especially after this cruel ink business.",
    "But I wish you hadnt said so right out like that.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "You think I should have kept it a secret\nWell whoever has been doing these stupid things  well that person is\nwarned now.",
    "Perhaps yes.",
    "Even if hes someone who wasnt here this evening he will hear about it.",
    "That is true.",
    "And we cant call in the police unless Mrs Nicoletis agrees  oh whos that\nnow There had been a sharp knock on the door.",
    "Mrs Hubbard called crossly\nCome in.",
    "Colin McNabb entered.",
    "Excuse me but I would like to speak to you with\nMonsieur Poirot here.",
    "With me Poirot turned his head in innocent surprise.",
    "Yes with you.",
    "Colin spoke sharply.",
    "I know youre a man whos had a lot\nof experience but if youll excuse me for saying so your methods and your ideas\nare both very oldfashioned.",
    "Really Colin said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "You are extremely rude.",
    "Crime and punishment Monsieur Poirot  thats all you think about.",
    "But\nnowadays even the Law has to understand that it is the causes that are\nimportant.",
    "But there cried Poirot I could not agree with you more\nBecause there always is a reason and it may be to the person concerned a\nvery good reason.",
    "I am studying Psychology and what Im saying is that youve\ngot to understand the basic cause of the trouble if youre ever to cure the young\ncriminal.",
    "Poirot said I am willing to listen to you Mr McNabb.",
    "Colin looked\nsurprised.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Well Ill start with the pair of shoes you returned to Sally\nFinch.",
    "Remember one shoe was stolen.",
    "Only one.",
    "I remember noticing the fact said Poirot.",
    "Colin McNabb leaned forward.",
    "Ah but you didnt see the importance of it.",
    "We have here very definitely a Cinderella complex.",
    "You know the Cinderella\nfairy story\nA French story  yes.",
    "Cinderella the servant sits by the fire her sisters go to the Princes party.",
    "A fairy godmother sends Cinderella too to that party.",
    "At midnight her beautiful\nclothes turn back to rags  she escapes leaving behind her one shoe.",
    "So here we\nhave a mind that compares itself to Cinderella  the girl who steals a shoe.",
    "Why\nA girl\nOf course a girl.",
    "That should be clear to the lowest intelligence.",
    "Really Colin said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "She wants to be the Princess to be claimed by the Prince.",
    "Another\nimportant fact the shoe is stolen from an attractive girl who is going to a party.",
    "So now lets look at a few of the other things that were taken.",
    "A powder compact\nlipsticks earrings a bracelet a ring  all pretty things and there are two\nimportant points here.",
    "The girl wants to be noticed.",
    "And she also wants to be\npunished.",
    "It is not the value of these things that is wanted.",
    "Yet a diamond ring was amongst the things stolen said Poirot.",
    "That was returned.",
    "And surely Mr McNabb you would not say that a stethoscope is a pretty\nthing\nThat had a deeper meaning.",
    "Women who feel they are not attractive can\nfind confidence through professional work.",
    "And the cookery book\nA symbol of home life husband and family.",
    "And boracic powder\nColin said crossly Monsieur Poirot nobody would steal boracic powder\nWhy would they\nThis is what I have asked myself.",
    "Mr McNabb you seem to have an\nanswer for everything.",
    "Explain to me then the importance of an old pair of grey\ntrousers  your trousers I understand.",
    "For the first time Colin appeared uncomfortable.",
    "I could explain that  but\nit would be complicated and perhaps  well rather embarrassing.",
    "Ah.",
    "And the ink that is spilt over another students papers the silk scarf\nthat is cut.",
    "Do these things cause you no worry Colins calmness suddenly\ndisappeared.",
    "They do.",
    "She ought to have treatment  at once.",
    "Medical treatment.",
    "Shes all confused.",
    "If I...\nPoirot interrupted him.",
    "You know then who she is\nI think perhaps that I do.",
    "Poirot said quietly A girl who is not very successful with men.",
    "A kind girl.",
    "A girl who is not very clever.",
    "A girl who feels lonely.",
    "A girl...",
    "There was a knock on the door.",
    "Come in said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "The door opened.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Miss Celia Austin.",
    "Celia looked at Colin with pain in her eyes.",
    "I didnt know you were here.",
    "I\ncame because  She took a deep breath and rushed to\nMrs Hubbard.",
    "Please please dont send for the police.",
    "Its me.",
    "Ive been\ntaking those things.",
    "I dont know why.",
    "I just  something told me to.",
    "She turned\nto Colin.",
    "So now you know what Im like... and youll never speak to me again.",
    "Im awful...\nNo youre not said Colin.",
    "If youll trust me Celia Ill soon be able to put\nyou right.",
    "Oh Colin  really\nHe took her hand.",
    "Dont worry.",
    "Then he looked at Mrs Hubbard.",
    "I hope\nnow that you will not call in the police.",
    "Celia will return anything she has taken.",
    "I cant return the bracelet and the powder compact said Celia anxiously.",
    "I\nput them in a rubbish bin.",
    "But Ill buy new ones.",
    "And the stethoscope said Poirot.",
    "Where did you put that\nI didnt take the stethoscope.",
    "And it wasnt me who spilt ink over\nElizabeths papers.",
    "I would never do a thing like that.",
    "Yet you cut up Miss Hobhouses scarf Mademoiselle\nCelia looked uncomfortable.",
    "That was different.",
    "I mean  Valerie didnt\nmind.",
    "And the rucksack\nOh I didnt cut that up.",
    "That was done with anger.",
    "Poirot took out the list he had copied from Mrs Hubbards notebook.",
    "Tell\nme which of these things you did or did not take\nCelia read the list.",
    "I dont know anything about the rucksack or the\nelectric light bulbs or bath salts and the ring was just a mistake.",
    "When I realised\nit was valuable I returned it.",
    "Colin said quickly.",
    "I can promise you that there will be no more things\ntaken.",
    "From now on Ill be responsible for her.",
    "Oh Colin you are good to me.",
    "I would like you to tell me all about your early home life Celia.",
    "Did your\nparents get on well together\nOh no it was awful \nExactly.",
    "And \nMrs Hubbard interrupted.",
    "That is enough.",
    "Im glad Celia that youve told\nthe truth.",
    "Now please go.",
    "As the door closed behind them she took a deep\nbreath.",
    "Well what do you think of that\nHercule Poirot smiled.",
    "I think  that we have helped at a love scene modern style.",
    "In my young days love was all like a beautiful dream.",
    "Nowadays it\nis the difficulties which bring a boy and girl together.",
    "All such nonsense.",
    "said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "Celias father died when she was\nyoung but she had a very happy childhood.",
    "Ah but she is wise enough not to say so to young McNabb\nDo you believe all those ideas of his Monsieur Poirot\nI do not believe that Celia had a Cinderella complex.",
    "I think she stole\nunimportant articles in order to attract the attention of Colin McNabb  and she\nhas been successful.",
    "I do apologize for wasting your time over such a silly business.",
    "Anyway\nalls well that ends well.",
    "No no.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "I do not think we are at the end yet.",
    "There\nare things still that are not explained and me I think that we have here\nsomething serious  really serious.",
    "I wonder Madame if I could speak to Miss\nPatricia Lane.",
    "I would like to examine the ring that was stolen.",
    "Why of course Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Ill go down and send her up to you.",
    "Patricia Lane came in shortly afterwards.",
    "Mrs Hubbard said you wanted to\nsee my ring.",
    "She slipped it off her finger and held it out to him.",
    "It was my\nmothers engagement ring.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "She is alive still your mother\nNo.",
    "Both my parents are dead.",
    "That is sad.",
    "Yes.",
    "They were both very nice people but somehow I was never quite so\nclose to them as I ought to have been.",
    "One feels sad about that afterwards.",
    "My\nmother wanted a daughter who was fond of clothes and parties.",
    "She was very\ndisappointed that I preferred History.",
    "You have always had a serious mind\nI think so.",
    "I feel that life is so short I ought to be doing something\nimportant.",
    "Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "Apart from a little lipstick Patricia Lane\nwore no makeup.",
    "Her mousecoloured hair was combed back from her face and\nher blue eyes looked back at him through glasses.",
    "Patricia was saying Im really very shocked about what happened to\nElizabeth.",
    "It seems to me that someone deliberately used the green ink to blame\nNigel.",
    "But Nigel would never do a thing like that.",
    "Ah.",
    "Poirot looked at her with more interest.",
    "Nigels not easy to understand.",
    "You see he had a very difficult home life.",
    "My goodness another of them\nWhat did you say\nNothing.",
    "Please continue \nAbout Nigel.",
    "Hes very clever but even if everybody in this place thinks\nhe did that trick with the ink he wont say that he didnt.",
    "Hell just say Let them\n\n\fthink it if they want to.",
    "And that attitude is really so stupid.",
    "It can be misunderstood certainly.",
    "Its a kind of pride I think.",
    "Because he has always been misunderstood.",
    "In\nsome ways in spite of his being so independent he needs looking after like a\nchild.",
    "Poirot felt suddenly very tired of love and was glad to be past all that.",
    "He\nstood up.",
    "Will you permit me Mademoiselle to keep your ring It will be\nreturned to you tomorrow.",
    "Certainly said Patricia.",
    "And please Mademoiselle be careful.",
    "Careful Careful of what\nI wish I knew said Hercule Poirot.",
    "CHAPTER SIX\nThe next day Mrs Hubbard woke with a sense of relief.",
    "A silly girl had\nbeen responsible for the recent events.",
    "And now there was order again.",
    "Going\ndown to breakfast however her new sense of peace was destroyed.",
    "Is it true Ma said Len Bateson.",
    "That its Celia whos been taking those\nthings Is that why she was not at breakfast\nIm not really surprised said Sally.",
    "I always had a sort of idea...\nAre you saying that it was Celia who threw ink on my notes Elizabeth\nlooked shocked.",
    "Celia did not throw ink on your work said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "And I wish you\nwould all stop discussing this.",
    "I meant to tell you all later but \nBut Jean was listening outside the door last night said Valerie.",
    "I was not listening.",
    "I just happened to go \nCome now Elizabeth said Nigel.",
    "You know very well who threw the\ngreen ink.",
    "I did of course.",
    "He didnt said Patricia.",
    "Hes only pretending.",
    "Nigel how can you be so\nstupid\nIm being kind to you Pat.",
    "Who borrowed my ink yesterday morning You\ndid.",
    "I do not understand please said Mr Akibombo.",
    "You dont want to Sally said.",
    "Colin McNabb had been trying to speak for some time.",
    "Now he hit the\ntable hard with his hand and suddenly everyone was silent.",
    "Dont any of you\nknow anything about psychology Celias been going through a very difficult\ntime and she needs treating with kindness not all this nonsense.",
    "I quite agree about being kind said Jean but we should not encourage\nstealing.",
    "This wasnt stealing.",
    "said Colin.",
    "You make me sick  all of you.",
    "Interesting case is she Colin said Valerie and smiled at him.",
    "If youre interested in the workings of the mind yes.",
    "I would like to make a formal protest.",
    "said Mr Chandra Lal an Indian\nstudent who also lived in the hostel.",
    "Boracic powder very necessary for my\neyes was taken.",
    "Please said Mr Akibombo.",
    "I still do not understand.",
    "Come along said Sally.",
    "Ill tell you about it on the way to the college.",
    "She guided him out of the room and was followed by the other students.",
    "Oh dear said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "Why did I ever take this job on\nValerie who was the only person left smiled.",
    "Dont worry Ma.",
    "Its a good\nthing its all come out.",
    "Everyone was getting very anxious.",
    "I must say I was very surprised.",
    "That it was Celia I thought it was rather obvious really.",
    "Have you always thought that\nWell one or two things made me wonder.",
    "Anyway shes got Colin where\nshe wants him.",
    "As Valerie went out Mrs Hubbard heard her saying cheerfully in the hall\nGood morning Celia.",
    "All is known and all is going to be forgiven.",
    "Celia came into the dining room her eyes red from crying.",
    "Youre very late.",
    "Mrs Hubbard said.",
    "The coffees cold and theres not\nmuch left to eat.",
    "I didnt want to meet the others.",
    "Youve got to meet them sooner or later.",
    "Oh I know but of course Ill leave at the end of the week.",
    "You dont need to do that.",
    "But youll have to pay for anything that you\ncant return.",
    "Celia interrupted her eagerly.",
    "Oh yes Ive got my cheque book with me.",
    "It was in her hand with an envelope.",
    "And I had written to you in case you\nwerent here to say how sorry I was.",
    "All right.",
    "Mrs Hubbard looked at the list of objects.",
    "Its difficult to say\nhow much \nWell let me give you a cheque for what you think and then I can take some\nback or give you more later.",
    "Mrs Hubbard suggested a sum and Celia opened the cheque book and\nstarted to write then stopped.",
    "Oh dear my pen has no ink.",
    "She went over to the\nshelves where there were various small things that belonged to the students.",
    "There isnt any ink here either except Nigels awful green.",
    "Oh Ill use that.",
    "She\nfilled the pen and wrote out the cheque.",
    "Then she looked at her watch.",
    "I shall be\nlate.",
    "I had better not stop for breakfast.",
    "Now you should have something Celia  Yes what is it  Geronimo the\nItalian manservant had come into the room.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis she has just come in.",
    "She wants to see you.",
    "She is very angry.",
    "Im coming.",
    "Mrs Hubbard left the room while Celia began cutting off a\npiece of bread.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis was walking up and down her room and turned when she\nheard Mrs Hubbard come in.",
    "You sent for the police Without a word to me\nWho do you think you are\nI did not send for the police.",
    "You are not telling the truth.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis you cant talk to me like that.",
    "Oh no Of course it is I who am wrong.",
    "Not you.",
    "Always me.",
    "Everything\nyou do is perfect.",
    "Police in my respectable hostel.",
    "But no one has called in the police.",
    "A famous private detective had\ndinner here last night.",
    "He gave a very interesting talk to the students.",
    "Yes and you told this detective friend of yours all about our most private\nmatters.",
    "That is a great breaking of trust.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Im responsible for this place and Im glad to tell you that one of\nthe students has admitted that she has been responsible for most of these things.",
    "What is the good of that My beautiful Students Home will now have a\nbad name.",
    "No one will come.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis sat down on the sofa and began to\ncry.",
    "Nobody thinks of my feelings.",
    "If I died tomorrow who would care\nWisely leaving this question unanswered Mrs Hubbard left the room.",
    "She then put notes in all the students rooms explaining that Celia wished\nto pay them for anything they had lost.",
    "As she came down to dinner Len Bateson stopped her.",
    "Ill wait for Celia\nout in the hall and bring her in.",
    "So that she knows everything is all right.",
    "Thats very nice of you Len.",
    "So as soup was being passed round Lens voice was heard from the hall.",
    "Come along in Celia.",
    "All friends here.",
    "Nigel remarked sharply to his soup plate So hes done his good job for\nthe day but he waved to Celia as she came in with Lens arm round her.",
    "And\nthere was a general sound of cheerful conversation.",
    "Colin McNabb came in late and seemed quieter than usual.",
    "When the meal\nwas nearly finished he got up and said Ive got to go out and see someone but I\nwould like to tell you all first.",
    "Celia and I  hope to get married next year when Ive done my course.",
    "He\nimmediately received good wishes and jokes from his friends and finally\nescaped.",
    "Im so glad Celia said Patricia.",
    "I hope youll be very happy.",
    "Everything is now perfect said Nigel.",
    "Why is dear Jean looking so\nserious Do you disapprove of marriage Jean\nOf course not.",
    "I always think its so much better than free love dont you Nicer for the\nchildren.",
    "Looks better on their passports.",
    "Elizabeth Johnston said suddenly I would still like to talk about what\nhappened yesterday.",
    "Valerie said Whats the matter Elizabeth\nOh please said Celia.",
    "I really think that if the person who threw the ink\non your papers and cut up that rucksack admits it like Ive done then\neverything will be all right.",
    "Valerie said with a short laugh And well all live happily ever after.",
    "They all got up and went into the common room.",
    "There was some\ncompetition to give Celia her coffee then finally everyone living in 24 and 26\nHickory Road went to bed.",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\nMiss Lemon was rarely if ever late.",
    "Storms illness transport failure none of these things seemed to affect her.",
    "But this morning Miss Lemon arrived\nbreathless at five minutes past ten instead of at ten oclock.",
    "Im extremely sorry Monsieur Poirot.",
    "I was just about to leave the flat\nwhen my sister rang up very upset.",
    "One of the students has committed suicide.",
    "What is the name of the student\nA girl called Celia Austin.",
    "How\nThey think she took morphia.",
    "Could it have been an accident\nOh no.",
    "She left a note.",
    "Poirot said softly It was not this I expected no... and yet it is true I\nexpected something.",
    "He looked at Miss Lemon.",
    "Please answer what letters you\ncan.",
    "Me I will go round to Hickory Road.",
    "Geronimo let Poirot in.",
    "Sir we have here big trouble.",
    "The girl she is dead\nin her bed this morning.",
    "First the doctor came.",
    "Now comes an Inspector of the\npolice.",
    "He is upstairs with Mrs Hubbard.",
    "Why would she wish to kill herself\nwhen last night she was engaged to be married\nEngaged\nYes yes to Mr Colin.",
    "Geronimo opened the door of the common room\nfor Poirot.",
    "You stay here yes When the police go I will tell Mrs Hubbard you\nare here.",
    "Upstairs Mrs Hubbard was with Inspector Sharpe who was asking\nquestions.",
    "He was a big comfortablelooking man with a gentle manner that hid\n\n\fhis determination.",
    "There will have to be an inquest he said.",
    "So we must get the facts right.",
    "Now this girl had been unhappy lately you say\nYes.",
    "Love affair\nNot exactly.",
    "Mrs Hubbard paused.",
    "You think perhaps she had a reason for killing herself\nInspector Sharpe the girl had done some very stupid things but...",
    "Yes\nWell for three months things have been disappearing  small things I\nmean  nothing important.",
    "No money.",
    "And this girl was responsible\nYes.",
    "The night before last a friend of mine came to dinner.",
    "A Monsieur\nHercule Poirot  perhaps you know the name\nInspector Sharpes eyes opened rather wide.",
    "Monsieur Hercule Poirot\nNow thats very interesting.",
    "He gave us a little talk after dinner and we discussed the fact that things\nhad been stolen.",
    "He advised me in front of them all to go to the police.",
    "He did did he\nAfterwards Celia came to my room and admitted everything.",
    "She was\nvery upset.",
    "Were you going to tell the police\nNo.",
    "She was going to pay for everything and everyone was very nice to\nher about it.",
    "Was she short of money\nNo.",
    "She had a job as a pharmacist at St Catherines Hospital and a little\nmoney of her own.",
    "It was kleptomania I suppose said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "You see\nthere was a young man she was fond of.",
    "And he ended their relationship\nOh no.",
    "The complete opposite.",
    "He defended her very strongly and last\nnight he told us that they were now engaged to be married.",
    "Inspector Sharpe looked very surprised.",
    "And then she goes to bed and\ntakes morphia\nI cant understand it.",
    "Mrs Hubbard shook her head.",
    "And yet the facts are clear.",
    "Sharpe looked at the small torn piece of paper\non the table.",
    "Dear Mrs Hubbard I really am sorry and this is the best thing I can do.",
    "Its not signed but you are sure its her handwriting\nYes.",
    "But Mrs Hubbard was worried.",
    "Why did she feel so strongly that\nthere was something wrong about it\nTheres one clear fingerprint on it which is definitely hers said the\nInspector.",
    "The morphia was in a small bottle with the label of St Catherines\nHospital on it so she probably brought it home with her yesterday in order to\ncommit suicide.",
    "I really cant believe that.",
    "She was so happy last night.",
    "Well perhaps her mood changed when she went up to bed.",
    "Perhaps there\nwas more in her past than you know about.",
    "This young man of hers  whats his\nname\nColin McNabb.",
    "Hes doing a Psychology course at St Catherines.",
    "Celia\nwas very much in love with him more I think than he was with her.",
    "That probably explains things.",
    "She hadnt told him everything she should\nhave.",
    "Young people are very romantic and sometimes expect too much of love\naffairs.",
    "He stood up.",
    "Thank you Mrs Hubbard.",
    "Her mother died two years ago\nand the only relative is an elderly aunt  well contact her.",
    "He picked up the\nsmall piece of paper with Celias writing on it.",
    "Theres something wrong about that said Mrs Hubbard suddenly.",
    "Wrong In what way\nI dont know  but I feel I should know.",
    "Oh dear I feel so stupid this\nmorning.",
    "Its all been very difficult for you.",
    "Inspector Sharpe opened the door and\nimmediately fell over Geronimo who was pressed against it.",
    "Hello he said.",
    "Listening at doors eh\nNo no I do not listen  never I am just coming in with message.",
    "I see.",
    "What message\nThere is gentleman downstairs to see Mrs Hubbard.",
    "All right.",
    "Go in and tell her.",
    "The Inspector walked down the passage and then paused as he heard\nGeronimo say The gentleman with the moustache he is waiting to see you.",
    "Gentleman with the moustache eh said Sharpe to himself and went\ndownstairs and into the common room.",
    "Hello Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Its a long time\nsince we met.",
    "Calmly Poirot turned from where he had been examining a bookshelf near\nthe fireplace.",
    "Surely  yes it is Inspector Sharpe is it not But you did not work\nin this part of London\nI moved here two years ago.",
    "So I would like to know why you came along\nhere the other night to give a talk on criminology to students.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "But Mrs Hubbard here is the sister of my wonderful\n\n\fsecretary Miss Lemon.",
    "So when she asked me  When she asked you to\ninvestigate what had been going on here you came along.",
    "Thats it really isnt\nit\nYou are correct.",
    "But why A silly girl taking a few things.",
    "Why did that interest you\nMonsieur Poirot\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "It is not so simple as that.",
    "Why not I dont understand Sharpe said.",
    "No and I do not understand.",
    "The things that were taken  they did not\nmake a pattern  they did not make sense.",
    "And other things happened that were\nmeant to fit in with the pattern of Celia Austin  but they did not fit in.",
    "They\nwere meaningless and some were even cruel.",
    "But Celia was not cruel.",
    "She was a kleptomaniac\nI very much doubt it.",
    "It is my opinion that stealing these cheap objects was\nto attract the attention of a certain young man.",
    "Colin McNabb\nYes.",
    "She was in love with Colin McNabb who never noticed her.",
    "So\ninstead of being a pretty wellbehaved girl she became a young criminal.",
    "Colin\nMcNabb was immediately interested in her.",
    "He must be very stupid.",
    "Not at all.",
    "He is a keen psychologist.",
    "Oh one of those I understand now.",
    "Inspector Sharpe smiled.",
    "So the girl\nwas rather clever.",
    "Surprisingly so.",
    "And I think the idea had been suggested to her by\nsomeone else.",
    "But still said Sharpe I dont understand.",
    "If this kleptomania business was\n\n\fsuccessful why did she commit suicide\nThe answer is that she did not commit suicide.",
    "Are you quite sure that she\ndid\nIts obvious Monsieur Poirot and \nThe door opened and Mrs Hubbard came in looking very pleased with\nherself.",
    "Ive got it.",
    "It came to me suddenly.",
    "Why that suicide note looked wrong\nI mean.",
    "Celia couldnt possibly have written it.",
    "Why not Mrs Hubbard asked Sharpe.",
    "Because its written in blueblack ink.",
    "And Celia filled her pen with green\nink  that ink over there  at breakfast time yesterday morning.",
    "She went to the\nshelf and held up the nearly empty bottle.",
    "I am sure that the piece of paper was\ntorn out of the letter she wrote to me yesterday  and which I never opened.",
    "What did she do with it Can you remember\nMrs Hubbard shook her head.",
    "I left her alone in here and she must have\njust forgotten about it.",
    "And somebody found it and opened it... somebody  The Inspector\npaused.",
    "You understand what this means Somebody saw the possibility of\nusing the opening words of her letter to you  to suggest something very\ndifferent.",
    "To suggest suicide  So this means \nMurder said Hercule Poirot.",
    "CHAPTER EIGHT\nIt was five oclock and Inspector Sharpe was drinking his third cup of tea.",
    "Thank you for inviting me to your home Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Ive got an hour to\nwait until the students get back to the house so that I can question them all.",
    "You have been to St Catherines Hospital Poirot asked.",
    "Yes.",
    "The chief\npharmacist was very helpful.",
    "What did he say about the girl\n\n\fShe had worked there for just over a year and everyone liked her.",
    "He\npaused.",
    "The morphia certainly came from there.",
    "It did That is interesting  and rather strange.",
    "It was morphine tartrate and was kept in the poison cupboard on the upper\nshelf amongst drugs that were not often used.",
    "So if one small bottle disappeared it would not immediately be noticed\nThats right.",
    "The three pharmacists all had keys to the poison cupboard\nbut on a busy day someone is going to it every few minutes therefore the\ncupboard is unlocked and remains unlocked till the end of work.",
    "What outsiders come into the pharmacy\nQuite a lot of people go through the pharmacy to get to the chief\npharmacists office  and salesmen from big drug companies go through it too.",
    "Then of course friends come in sometimes to see one of the pharmacists.",
    "Who came in recently to see Celia Austin\nSharpe looked at his notebook.",
    "A girl called Patricia Lane came on\nTuesday last week.",
    "She wanted Celia to meet her at the cinema after the\npharmacy closed.",
    "Patricia Lane said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "She was only there for about five minutes and did not go near the poison\ncupboard.",
    "They also remember a West Indian girl coming  about two weeks\nago.",
    "She was interested in the work and asked questions about it and made\nnotes.",
    "That must be Elizabeth Johnston.",
    "Anyone else\nNot that the other pharmacists can remember.",
    "Do doctors come to the pharmacy\nSharpe smiled.",
    "All the time.",
    "Sometimes to ask about a particular drug.",
    "Sometimes they just come in for a talk to the girls.",
    "And a lot of young fellows\ncome in for pills because theyve been drinking too much.",
    "Poirot said And if I remember rightly one or more of the students at\nHickory Road is studying at St Catherines  a big redhaired boy  Bateman \nLeonard Bateson.",
    "Thats right.",
    "And Colin McNabb is doing a course there.",
    "Then theres a girl Jean Tomlinson who works in the physiotherapy department.",
    "And all of these have probably been quite often in the pharmacy\nYes and nobody remembers when because theyre so used to seeing them.",
    "It is not easy said Poirot.",
    "No it is not Sharpe paused.",
    "You said this morning that someone might\nhave suggested the kleptomania idea to Celia Austin.",
    "If so who\nOnly three of the students I believe would have been able to think of\nsuch an idea.",
    "Leonard Bateson might have suggested kleptomania to Celia\nalmost as a joke but I do not really think he would have allowed such a thing to\ngo on for so long.",
    "Nigel Chapman is a humorous and slightly cruel character.",
    "He\nwould think it good fun and would not care if things went wrong.",
    "The third person is a young woman called Valerie Hobhouse.",
    "She is clever\nand has probably read enough psychology to judge Colins probable reaction.",
    "Thanks said Sharpe writing down the names.",
    "And is that all the help you\ncan give me Monsieur Poirot\nI fear so.",
    "But I shall continue to be interested and do what I can.",
    "For me\nthere is only one method.",
    "And that is\nConversation my friend.",
    "Conversation and again conversation All the\nmurderers I have ever met enjoyed talking.",
    "They are so pleased with themselves\nthat sooner or later they say something that shows they know too much about the\ncrime.",
    "Sharpe stood up.",
    "I suppose every single one of the students is a possible\nmurderer.",
    "I think so said Poirot lightly.",
    "CHAPTER NINE\nInspector Sharpe leaned back in his chair and took a deep breath.",
    "He had\ninterviewed a tearful French girl the gentle Mr Akibombo and several other\nforeign students who did not really understand what he was saying.",
    "None of\nthese he was certain knew anything about the death of Celia Austin.",
    "His next interview was with Nigel Chapman who immediately took\ncontrol of the conversation.",
    "Of course I had an idea that youd got it wrong\nwhen you thought it was suicide.",
    "But it rather pleases me that you suddenly saw\nit in a new way because she filled her pen with my green ink.",
    "The one thing the\nmurderer couldnt possibly have expected.",
    "I suppose youve thought carefully\nabout what can be the motive for this crime\nIm asking the questions Mr Chapman said Inspector Sharpe.",
    "Oh of\ncourse said Nigel.",
    "I was trying to go directly to the important points.",
    "But I\nsuppose weve got to go through all the usual boring questions.",
    "Name Nigel\nChapman.",
    "Age twentyfive.",
    "Im studying History at London University.",
    "Anything else you want to know\nWhat is your home address Mr Chapman\nNo home address.",
    "I have a father but he and I have quarrelled and his\naddress is therefore no longer mine.",
    "So 26 Hickory Road and Coutts Bank will\nalways find me.",
    "Inspector Sharpe did not react to Nigels behaviour.",
    "He suspected that it hid\nhis nervousness of being questioned about a murder.",
    "How well did you know\nCelia Austin he asked.",
    "I knew her very well in the sense that I saw her almost every day but in\nfact I didnt know her at all.",
    "I wasnt interested in her and I think she probably\ndisapproved of me.",
    "Did she disapprove of you for any particular reason\nShe didnt like my sense of humour.",
    "When was the last time you saw Celia Austin\nAt dinner yesterday evening.",
    "When Colin told us they were engaged.",
    "Was that at dinner or in the common room\nAt dinner.",
    "Afterwards when we went into the common room Colin went\noff somewhere.",
    "And the rest of you had coffee in the common room\nYes.",
    "Did Celia Austin have coffee\nWell I suppose so.",
    "I mean I didnt actually notice her having coffee but\nshe must have had it.",
    "You did not personally hand her some coffee\nAre you trying to suggest something Mr Sharpe Well I didnt go near\nher.",
    "Ive never been attracted to Celia and her engagement to Colin McNabb\ncaused no murderous feelings in me.",
    "Im not suggesting anything like that Mr Chapman said Sharpe.",
    "But\nsomebody wanted Celia Austin dead.",
    "Why\nI cant imagine why Inspector.",
    "Celia was such a boring girl but very nice\nnot at all the type to get herself murdered.",
    "Were you surprised when you found that it was Celia who had been\nstealing things here\nVery.",
    "You didnt perhaps encourage her to take those things\nMe Why would I And surely Inspector the reason was psychological\nDo you think that Celia Austin was a kleptomaniac\n\n\fWhat other explanation can there be\nYou dont think that someone might have suggested it to Miss Austin as a\nway of  say  making Mr McNabb look at her in a new way\nNigels eyes shone.",
    "Now that really is a most interesting explanation.",
    "And\nits perfectly possible because of course Colin would react like that.",
    "Have you any ideas Mr Chapman about the things that have been going\non in this house About for example the throwing of ink over Miss Johnstons\npapers\nIf youre thinking I did it Inspector thats quite untrue.",
    "Of course it looks\nlike me because of the green ink but if you ask me somebody used my ink to\nmake it look like me.",
    "The next person on Inspector Sharpes list was Leonard Bateson.",
    "He was\neven more uncomfortable than Nigel though it showed in a different way.",
    "All right he shouted after the first few questions.",
    "I poured out Celias\ncoffee and gave it to her.",
    "And you can believe it or not but there was no morphia\nin it.",
    "You saw her drink it\nNo.",
    "We were all moving around and I got into an argument with someone\njust after that.",
    "So you are saying that anybody could have dropped morphia into her\ncoffee cup\nNo.",
    "You try to put anything in anyones cup Everybody would see you.",
    "Would they said Sharpe.",
    "Len shouted Why do you think I would want to poison the girl I liked\nher.",
    "She must have taken it herself.",
    "Theres no other explanation.",
    "We might think so if it wasnt for the false suicide note.",
    "False She wrote it didnt she\nShe wrote it as part of a letter early that morning.",
    "Well  she could have torn a bit out and used it as a suicide note.",
    "Really Mr Bateson if you wanted to write a suicide note you would write\none.",
    "You wouldnt take a letter you had written to somebody else and carefully\ntear out one particular bit.",
    "I might do.",
    "People do all sorts of strange things.",
    "So did you believe Celia when she said she had stolen the things in the\nhouse\nOf course.",
    "But it did seem strange.",
    "She didnt seem to be the type to be a\nkleptomaniac.",
    "Nor a thief either.",
    "And you cant think of any other reason for her having done it\nWhat other reason could there be\nWell she might have wanted to make Colin McNabb interested in her.",
    "Len shook his head.",
    "She wouldnt have been able to plan a thing like that.",
    "She didnt have the knowledge.",
    "Youve got the knowledge though havent you\nLen gave a short laugh.",
    "You think I would do a stupid thing like that\nYoure mad.",
    "The Inspector changed direction.",
    "Do you think that Celia Austin spilled\nthe ink over Elizabeth Johnstons papers or do you think someone else did it\nSomeone else.",
    "Celia said she didnt do that and I believe her.",
    "She never got\nannoyed with Elizabeth not like some people did.",
    "Who got annoyed with her  and why \nShe criticised people you know.",
    "Len paused.",
    "Anyone who said something\n\n\fwithout really thinking.",
    "She would look across the table and say something like\nIm afraid that is not proved by the facts.",
    "It has been well established by\nmathematics that... Well it was annoying  especially to Nigel for example.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "Nigel Chapman.",
    "And it was green ink too.",
    "So you think it was Nigel who did it\nWell its possible.",
    "Can you think of anybody else who Elizabeth Johnston annoyed\nWell Colin McNabb wasnt too pleased now and again nor was Jean\nTomlinson.",
    "Sharpe saw Valerie Hobhouse next.",
    "Valerie was cool and stylish.",
    "She seemed much less nervous than either of\nthe men.",
    "She had been fond of Celia she said.",
    "Celia was not very clever and it\nwas rather sad the way she so loved Colin McNabb.",
    "Do you think she was a kleptomaniac Miss Hobhouse\nWell I suppose so.",
    "I dont really know much about the subject.",
    "Do you think anyone had encouraged her to do what she did\nYou mean in order to attract Colin\nYoure very quick on the point Miss Hobhouse.",
    "Yes thats what I mean.",
    "You didnt suggest it to her perhaps\nValerie smiled.",
    "Well no considering that a favourite scarf of mine was cut\nto pieces.",
    "Im not as kind as that.",
    "Do you think anyone else suggested it to her\nNo.",
    "I think it was just natural behaviour.",
    "What do you mean by natural\nWell I first suspected that it was Celia when Sallys shoe went missing.",
    "Celia was jealous of Sally.",
    "Shes easily the most attractive girl here and Colin\ngave her a lot of attention.",
    "So on the night of this party Sallys shoe disappeared\nand she had to go in an old black dress and black shoes.",
    "And there was Celia\nlooking as pleased as a cat thats swallowed the cream.",
    "But I didnt suspect her of\ntaking all these other things like bracelets and compacts.",
    "Who did you think took those\nValerie shook her head.",
    "Oh I dont know.",
    "One of the cleaning women I\nthought.",
    "And the rucksack that was cut up\nWas there a rucksack taken I had forgotten.",
    "Miss Hobhouse have you any ideas of your own about Celia Austins\ndeath Any idea of the motive for it\nValeries face was serious now.",
    "No.",
    "It was a horrible thing to happen.",
    "I\ncant think of anybody who wanted Celia to die.",
    "She was a nice girl and she had\njust got engaged and...\nAnd\nI wondered if that was why said Valerie slowly.",
    "Because she had got\nengaged.",
    "Because she was going to be happy.",
    "But that means somebody is  well\n mad.",
    "Inspector Sharpe looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "Yes.",
    "Madness is a possible\nreason.",
    "So have you any theory about the ink on Elizabeth Johnstons papers\nI dont believe that Celia would do a thing like that.",
    "Any idea who it could have been\nWell... not a reasonable idea.",
    "But an unreasonable one\nWell Ive got a sort of idea that it was Patricia Lane.",
    "Really Now you do surprise me.",
    "Patricia Lane seems such a wellbalanced young lady.",
    "Im not saying she did do it.",
    "I just think she might have.",
    "Why\nWell Patricia disliked Elizabeth because she was always criticising her\nbeloved Nigel.",
    "You know when he made silly statements the way he does.",
    "You think it was more likely to have been Patricia rather than Nigel\nhimself\nOh yes.",
    "Nigel wouldnt bother and he would certainly not use his own\nspecial ink.",
    "Then it might be somebody who did not like Nigel Chapman and wanted\nto make people think that he did it Who does dislike him\nOh well Jean Tomlinson does.",
    "And Nigel and Len Bateson often quarrel\nwith each other.",
    "Have you any ideas Miss Hobhouse how morphia could have been given\nto Celia Austin\nI suppose the coffee is the most obvious way.",
    "We were all moving around\nin the common room.",
    "Celias coffee was on a small table near her and she always\nwaited until it was nearly cold before she drank it.",
    "Anybody could have dropped\na pill or something into her cup.",
    "The morphia said Inspector Sharpe was in the form of a powder.",
    "Oh.",
    "That would be rather more difficult wouldnt it\nCan you describe to me exactly what happened that evening in the\ncommon room\n\n\fWell we all sat about talked.",
    "Most of the boys went out.",
    "Celia went up to\nbed rather early and so did Jean Tomlinson.",
    "Sally and I stayed there rather late.",
    "I\nwas writing letters and Sally was reading some notes.",
    "I think I was the last to go\nup to bed.",
    "Thank you Miss Hobhouse.",
    "Will you send Miss Lane to me now\nPatricia Lane looked worried but not frightened.",
    "And she told the\nInspector nothing very new.",
    "When he asked her about Elizabeth Johnstons\npapers Patricia said that she was sure that Celia had thrown the ink on them.",
    "But she said she didnt Miss Lane.",
    "Well of course she would.",
    "But it fits in doesnt it with all the other\nthings\nDo you know what I think about this case Miss Lane That nothing fits in\nvery well.",
    "I suppose said Patricia that you think it was Nigel who did it because of\nthe ink.",
    "Thats such nonsense.",
    "I mean Nigel wouldnt have used his own ink if\nhe had done a thing like that.",
    "But anyway he wouldnt do it.",
    "He didnt always get on very well with Miss Johnston did he\nOh she could be annoying sometimes but he didnt really mind.",
    "Patricia\nLane leaned forward.",
    "I would like to try to make you understand some things\nabout Nigel Inspector.",
    "Im the first to admit that hes got a very difficult manner.",
    "It turns people against him.",
    "Hes rude and makes fun of people but really hes\nvery different from what he seems.",
    "Hes one of those shy rather unhappy people\nwho really want to be liked but who for some reason find themselves saying\nand doing the opposite to what they mean to say and do.",
    "Ah said Inspector Sharpe.",
    "Rather unfortunate that.",
    "Yes but it comes from having had an unfortunate childhood.",
    "Nigels father\nwas very hard and never understood him.",
    "He treated his mother very badly too.",
    "After she died they had a big quarrel and Nigel left the house and his father said\nthat he would never give him any help or money.",
    "Nigel said he didnt want\nanything from his father and he never went near him again.",
    "Since his mother\n\n\fdied hes never had anyone to care for him.",
    "He has a wonderful mind but just\ncant show himself as he really is.",
    "Inspector Sharpe looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "In love with the fellow he\nthought.",
    "He wondered if Nigel Chapman had been attracted to Celia Austin.",
    "If\nso Patricia Lane might have disliked her a lot.",
    "Disliked her enough to murder\nher Surely not  and of course the fact that Celia had got engaged to Colin\nMcNabb would surely destroy that as a possible motive.",
    "He thanked Patricia\nLane and asked for Jean Tomlinson.",
    "CHAPTER TEN\nJean Tomlinson was a severelooking young woman with fair hair and a\nrather tight mouth.",
    "She sat down.",
    "How can I help you Inspector It was bad\nenough when we thought Celia had committed suicide but now that its\nsupposed to be murder... She stopped and shook her head.",
    "Do you know where the poison came from said Sharpe.",
    "Jean nodded.",
    "I\nhear it came from St Catherines Hospital but that makes it seem more like\nsuicide.",
    "It was probably intended to.",
    "I hear that you often visited the pharmacy\nMiss Tomlinson.",
    "I went in there to see my friend Mildred one of the other pharmacists yes.",
    "But I would never have gone to the poison cupboard.",
    "But you could have done so\nThat is a disgusting accusation.",
    "Inspector Sharpe.",
    "But its not an accusation Miss Tomlinson.",
    "I am just saying that it was\npossible for you to go to the poison cupboard.",
    "Im not saying that you did so.",
    "I\nmean why would you\nExactly.",
    "I was a friend of Celias.",
    "People do sometimes get poisoned by their friends.",
    "Did you suspect it was\nCelia who had stolen the things in the house\nNo.",
    "I always thought Celia had high principles.",
    "Of course said Sharpe kleptomaniacs cant really help themselves can\nthey\nJean Tomlinson paused.",
    "I cant agree with that idea.",
    "Stealing is stealing.",
    "People should be punished for these things.",
    "But instead everything was ending happily and Miss Austin was getting\nmarried.",
    "One isnt surprised at anything Colin McNabb does said Jean.",
    "He isnt\nreligious and my opinion is that hes a Communist He supported Celia because\nhe thinks everyone should just take anything they want.",
    "What about the ink on Elizabeth Johnstons papers Did she do that\nIt does seem unlikely.",
    "You think it was Nigel Chapman\nNo I dont think Nigel would do that either.",
    "I think it was probably Mr\nAkibombo.",
    "Really Why would he do it\nJealousy.",
    "Because Elizabeth is so clever.",
    "Inspector Sharpe thought for a moment.",
    "When was the last time you saw\nCelia Austin\nAfter dinner on Friday night.",
    "Who went up to bed first she or you\nI did.",
    "And youve no idea who could have put morphia into her coffee  if it was\ngiven that way\nNo idea at all.",
    "You never saw morphia anywhere in the house\nNo I dont think so.",
    "You dont think so Miss Tomlinson\nWell I just wondered.",
    "There was that silly bet.",
    "What bet\nOh some of the boys were arguing  Colin and Nigel started it and then\nLen joined in and Patricia was there too.",
    "What were they arguing about\nMurder and ways of doing it.",
    "Really Can you remember what was said \nJean Tomlinson considered.",
    "Well it started with a discussion on murder\nby using poison.",
    "They said that the difficulty was to obtain the poison that the\nmurderer was usually found because of where he bought poison or because he\nhad an opportunity to get it.",
    "But Nigel said that he could think of three ways by\nwhich anyone could obtain a poison and nobody would ever know.",
    "Len Bateson\nsaid that he was talking nonsense.",
    "Nigel said no he wasnt and he would prove\nit.",
    "Pat said that Nigel was right and that either Len or Colin could probably get\npoison any time they liked from a hospital and so could Celia.",
    "And Nigel said\nthat wasnt what he meant at all.",
    "He said that he who wasnt a doctor or\npharmacist could get three different types of poison by three different methods.",
    "Len Bateson said All right then but what are your methods and Nigel said\nI wont tell you now but I bet you that within three weeks I can produce three\ndeadly poisons here and Len Bateson said he would bet him five pounds he\ncouldnt do it.",
    "Well what happened said Inspector Sharpe.",
    "Nothing for some time and then one evening in the common room Nigel\nsaid Look here  I did it and he put three things on the table a tube of\nhvoscine pills a bottle of digitalis and a tiny bottle of morphine.",
    "The Inspector said sharply Morphine.",
    "Any label on it\nYes it had St Catherines Hospital on it.",
    "And the others\nI dont think they were from hospitals.",
    "What happened next\nWell Len Bateson said But if you had committed a murder this would\nsoon lead to you and Nigel said No it wouldnt.",
    "I have no connection with any\nhospital and nobody will connect me with these.",
    "Well they argued a bit but in\nthe end Len said he would pay the five pounds.",
    "He then said What are we\ngoing to do with the poisons Nigel said we had better get rid of them before\nany accidents happened so they threw the pills and the morphine on the fire.",
    "The\ndigitalis they poured down the lavatory.",
    "And the bottles\nI dont know what happened to the bottles.",
    "And this all happened  when\nJust over two weeks ago I think.",
    "Inspector Sharpe remained thinking for a while after she had gone.",
    "Then\nhe asked Nigel Chapman in again.",
    "Ive just had a rather interesting statement\nfrom Miss Tomlinson he said.",
    "Ah Whos dear Jean been poisoning your mind against Me\nShes been talking about poison and in connection with you Mr\nChapman.",
    "I hear that you had a bet with Mr Bateson about three methods of\nobtaining poison\nOh that Nigel smiled.",
    "Yes of course I dont even remember Jean being\nthere.",
    "You admit it then\nOh yes.",
    "Colin and Len were being rather annoying so...",
    "So what were your three methods Mr Chapman\nNigel leant his head on one side.",
    "Arent you asking me to incriminate\nmyself\n\n\fYou can refuse to answer my questions if you like.",
    "Nigel considered for a moment a slight smile on his lips.",
    "Of course what\nI did was against the law.",
    "You could charge me for it.",
    "But if its got any\nconnection with poor little Celias death I suppose I should tell you.",
    "That would certainly be the sensible decision.",
    "All right then Ill talk.",
    "What were these three methods\nWell.",
    "Nigel leant back in his chair.",
    "Ones always reading in the papers\nabout doctors losing dangerous drugs from a car.",
    "So I thought that one very\nsimple method would be to go down to the country follow a doctor about and\nwhen the opportunity came just open the car look in the doctors case and take\nwhat you wanted.",
    "I had to follow three doctors until I found a suitably careless\none.",
    "When I did it was so easy.",
    "The car was left outside a farmhouse.",
    "I looked in\nthe case took out a tube of hyoscine and that was that.",
    "And method number two\nThat involved Celia but she had no idea what I was doing.",
    "I just talked\nabout the funny way doctors write prescriptions and asked her to write one for\nme like a doctor would write it for digitalis.",
    "So she did.",
    "All I then had to do was\nto find a doctor living in another part of London write his signature on the\nprescription so that it was hard to read and take it to a chemist in another busy\npart of London.",
    "I received the medicine without any difficulty at all.",
    "And the third method\nI am incriminating myself I can hear it in your voice.",
    "Stealing drugs from an unlocked car is larceny.",
    "Forging a prescription...\nNigel interrupted him.",
    "But I didnt obtain money by it and it wasnt a copy\nof any particular doctors signature.",
    "Anyway Im only telling you because...",
    "Yes Mr Chapman...\n\n\fNigel said with sudden feeling Celia didnt deserve to be murdered and I\nwant to help.",
    "Mr Chapman the police can choose how they treat some types of\nbehaviour.",
    "So please tell me about your third method.",
    "Well said Nigel it was a bit more risky than the other two but it was also\nmore fun.",
    "You see I had been to visit Celia before in her pharmacy.",
    "I knew the\nplace reasonably well...",
    "So you were able to take the bottle out of the cupboard\nNo no if I had been planning a real murder someone would remember\nthat I had been there.",
    "No I knew that Celia always went into the back room at\nelevenfifteen for a cup of coffee.",
    "There was a new girl there and she didnt\nknow me so with a white coat on and a stethoscope round my neck I walked\ninto the pharmacy when she was alone there.",
    "I went along to the poison\ncupboard took out a bottle then asked the girl if she had a couple of headache\npills as I had had too much to drink the night before.",
    "I swallowed them and\nwalked out.",
    "She never suspected that I wasnt a doctor.",
    "It was so easy.",
    "A stethoscope said Inspector Sharpe.",
    "Where did you get that\nNigel smiled.",
    "It was Len Batesons.",
    "You should have seen everyones face\nwhen I put those three poisons on the table.",
    "But we got rid of all of them at least\ntwo weeks ago.",
    "That is what you think Mr Chapman but it may not really be so.",
    "What do you mean\nHow long had you had these things in your possession\nWell the hyoscine about ten days.",
    "The morphine about four days.",
    "The\ndigitalis I had only got that afternoon.",
    "And where did you keep these things\nIn my chest of drawers under my socks.",
    "Did anyone know that\nNo.",
    "Did you tell anyone about what you were doing\nNo.",
    "At least  no I didnt.",
    "You said at least Mr Chapman.",
    "Well I was going to tell Pat then I thought she wouldnt approve so I\ndidnt.",
    "I told her after I had got them.",
    "She was not amused.",
    "But we just threw it\nall on the fire and down the lavatory with no harm done.",
    "But its very possible that harm was done.",
    "Have you never thought Mr\nChapman that someone might have seen where you put those things and that\nsomeone might have emptied morphia out of the bottle and replaced it with\nsomething else\nGoodness no But nobody could possibly have known.",
    "Which students might normally go into your room\nWell I share it with Len Bateson.",
    "Most of the men here have been in it.",
    "Not the girls of course.",
    "Theyre not allowed to come to the bedroom floors on\nour side of the house.",
    "But they might still do so\nAnyone might said Nigel.",
    "In the afternoon theres nobody about.",
    "Does Miss Lane ever come to your room\nI hope you dont mean that the way it sounds Inspector.",
    "Pat comes to my\nroom sometimes to return some socks shes mended.",
    "Thats all.",
    "Leaning forward Inspector Sharpe said You do see Mr Chapman that the\nperson who could most easily have taken some of that poison out of the bottle\nwas yourself\nNigel looked at him his face suddenly very tired.",
    "Yes.",
    "I saw that just a\n\n\fminute and a half ago.",
    "But I had no reason to kill the girl Inspector and I didnt\ndo it.",
    "Although youve only got my word for it.",
    "CHAPTER ELEVEN\nLen Bateson and Colin McNabb both agreed that the story of the bet and\nthe throwing away of the poison was true.",

    "Just ask me any questions which you think may be useful to\nyou.",
    "It was your opinion that Celia Austins behaviour had a psychological\norigin\nTheres no doubt about it.",
    "Her childhood had been very difficult because...",
    "Yes Im sure.",
    "Inspector Sharpe did not want to hear the story of yet\nanother unhappy childhood.",
    "Nigels had been enough.",
    "You had been attracted to\nher for some time\nI would not say that said Colin.",
    "Subconsciously no doubt but I was not\naware of it.",
    "Had Celia any enemies here\nNo Inspector.",
    "Celia was well liked.",
    "I do not think it was a personal matter\nthe reason she was killed.",
    "What do you mean by not a personal matter\nI do not wish to say at the moment.",
    "Im not clear about it myself.",
    "The Inspector could not move him from that position.",
    "The last two students to be interviewed were Sally Finch and Elizabeth\nJohnston.",
    "Sally was an attractive girl with red hair and bright intelligent eyes.",
    "After\nthe usual questions she said Inspector I would like to tell you that I think theres\nsomething very wrong about this house.",
    "You mean youre afraid of something Miss Finch\nSally nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "The place isnt what it seems.",
    "And Ill bet you that\nawful old Mrs Nicoletis knows about it.",
    "Thats interesting.",
    "Can you be clearer\nSally shook her head.",
    "No.",
    "All I can tell you is that something unpleasant is\ngoing on here Inspector.",
    "Other people feel it too.",
    "Akibombo does.",
    "Hes\nfrightened.",
    "I believe Elizabeth does but she wouldnt say anything.",
    "And I think\nthat Celia knew something about it.",
    "Knew something about what\nThere were things she said that last day.",
    "About clearing everything up.",
    "She\nhad admitted her part in what was going on but I think she knew something\nabout someone.",
    "Thats the reason I think she was killed.",
    "But if it was something as serious as that...\nSally interrupted him.",
    "I think she had no idea how serious it was.",
    "I see.",
    "Thank you... Now the last time you saw Celia was in the common\nroom after dinner last night\nI saw her after that.",
    "When I went up to bed she was going out of the front\ndoor.",
    "Thats rather surprising.",
    "I think she was going to meet someone.",
    "Someone from outside.",
    "Or one of the students\nWell I think that it was one of the students.",
    "Because if she wanted to\nspeak to somebody privately there was nowhere she could do it in the house.",
    "Do you know when she returned\nNo.",
    "Thank you Miss Finch.",
    "Last of all the Inspector talked to Elizabeth Johnston.",
    "Celia Austin said\nthat it was not she who damaged your papers.",
    "Do you believe her\nI do not think Celia did it.",
    "No.",
    "You dont know who did\nThe obvious answer is Nigel Chapman.",
    "But it seems to me a little too\nobvious.",
    "Nigel is clever.",
    "He would not use his own ink.",
    "And if not Nigel who then\nThat is more difficult.",
    "But I think Celia knew who it was.",
    "Did she tell you so\nNot really but yesterday evening before dinner she came to tell me that\nthough she had stolen the things she had not damaged my work.",
    "I said I\nbelieved her then asked if she knew who had done so.",
    "And what did she say\nShe said  Elizabeth paused a moment she said I cant really be sure\nbecause I dont see why...",
    "It might have been a mistake or an accident... Im sure\nwhoever did it would really like to admit it.",
    "And there are some things I dont\nunderstand like the light bulbs the day the police came.",
    "Whats this about the police and light bulbs\nI dont know.",
    "All Celia said was I didnt take them out.",
    "And then she\nsaid I wondered if it had anything to do with the passport I said What\npassport And she said I think someone might have a forged passport.",
    "The Inspector was silent.",
    "Here at last a faint pattern seemed to be taking\nshape.",
    "A passport... What more did she say\n\n\fShe just said Anyway I shall know more about it tomorrow.",
    "I shall\nknow more about it tomorrow.",
    "Thats a very interesting remark.",
    "The Inspector was again silent as he considered.",
    "Before coming to Hickory Road with Sergeant Cobb he had looked up the\nrecords.",
    "Hostels which housed foreign students were carefully watched.",
    "Number\n26 Hickory Road had a good record.",
    "There had only been one inquiry when\nthere was a routine check of all hostels for a foreign student wanted for the\nmurder of a woman near Cambridge.",
    "This had happened some time ago and\ncould not possibly have any connection with the death of Celia Austin.",
    "He looked up to see Elizabeth Johnstons dark intelligent eyes watching\nhim and suddenly said Have you ever had a feeling that something was wrong\nabout this place\nShe looked surprised.",
    "In what way  wrong\nI dont really know.",
    "Im thinking of something Miss Finch said to me.",
    "Oh  Sally Finch Americans are all the same suspicious of everything\nThe Inspectors interest grew.",
    "So Elizabeth disliked Sally Finch.",
    "Why\nBecause Sally was an American Or did Elizabeth dislike Americans just\nbecause Sally was an American\nHe said You understand Miss Johnston we just ask most people for facts.",
    "But when we meet someone with a high level of intelligence  He paused.",
    "Would she respond\nShe did.",
    "What you want is the clarity of a trained mind.",
    "Inspector Sharpe nodded.",
    "Thats why I would value your opinion.",
    "Elizabeth said Dont listen to Sally Finch Inspector.",
    "This is a good wellrun hostel.",
    "I am certain that you will find no illegal political activities here.",
    "Inspector Sharpe was surprised.",
    "It wasnt really political activities I was\nthinking about.",
    "Oh  I see  She was a little confused.",
    "I was thinking of what Celia said\nabout a passport.",
    "But I am sure that the reason for Celias death was a private\none.",
    "I see.",
    "Well thank you Miss Johnston.",

    "There have been difficulties yes\nThats a very nice way of saying it.",
    "Inspector Sharpe came with a search\nwarrant today and Ive got Mrs Nicoletis here shouting at me.",
    "I am sorry Poirot said it is just a little question I have to ask.",
    "You sent\nme a list of those things that had disappeared but did you write that list in the\norder they were taken\nNo Im sorry I just wrote them down as I thought of them.",
    "Would it be too difficult for you to remember and write what was the\nproper order\nWell the rucksack I believe was the first and the light bulbs and then the\nbracelet and the compact no  the evening shoe.",

    "My students they will all\nleave.",
    "I shall be ruined...\nMadam this is a murder case.",
    "It is not murder  it is suicide.",
    "So Ill start here in your sitting room.",
    "Here no I refuse Mrs Nicoletis shouted.",
    "7 am above the law.",
    "No one is above the law.",
    "So please stand aside.",
    "He started with the desk.",

    "A little moment.",
    "Poirot stopped him.",
    "Do you remember the day when\ncertain electric light bulbs disappeared\nYes I remember.",
    "Exactly what bulbs were taken\nThe one in the hall and I think in the common room.",
    "Do you remember the date\nGeronimo thought.",
    "I think it was on the day when a policeman come\nsome time in February \nA policeman What did a policeman come here for\nHe come here to see Mrs Nicoletis about a man who murdered a woman\nsomewhere else.",
    "And that was the day the bulbs were missing\nYes.",
    "Because I turn switch and nothing happen.",
    "And I look in drawer for\nmore and I see bulbs have gone.",
    "So I use just candles.",
    "Poirot thought about this as he followed Geronimo up to Mrs Hubbards\nroom.",
    "She was looking very tired and held out a piece of paper to him.",
    "Ive done\nmy best to write down these things in the proper order but Im not sure that its\ncompletely accurate.",
    "I am deeply grateful to you Madame.",
    "Poirot looked at the piece of paper.",
    "I see now that the rucksack is first.",
    "You had I believe a visit from the police\nhere And it was after that that you found the rucksack\nYes.",
    "Len Bateson was going off on a hitchhike and he couldnt find his\nrucksack anywhere and everyone looked and at last Geronimo found it behind\nthe boiler all cut up.",
    "So strange and pointless Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Yes strange and pointless.",
    "Poirot paused.",
    "How soon after this did the\nstealing begin\nI think... yes Genevieve said she had missed her bracelet about a week\nafter that.",
    "Between 20th and 25th February.",
    "And after that the stealing went on\nYes.",
    "And this rucksack was Len Bateson very angry about it\nYes.",
    "But Len is that type of boy Monsieur Poirot said Mrs Hubbard\nsmiling.",
    "Hes also very generous and kind.",
    "What was it this rucksack  something special\nOh no it was just ordinary.",
    "Could you show me one like it\nOf course.",
    "Colins got one.",
    "So has Nigel  in fact Lens got one again now\nbecause he had to go and buy another.",
    "They get them at the shop at the end of\nthe road.",
    "Its much cheaper than any of the big stores.",
    "Mrs Hubbard led him to\nColin McNabbs room opened the cupboard and picked up a rucksack.",
    "It would take some strength to cut that said Poirot.",
    "Oh yes strength and  well  anger you know.",
    "I know yes it is not pleasant.",
    "Then when later that scarf of Valeries was found also cut to pieces well\n\n\fit did look  unbalanced.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "But I think there you are wrong Madame.",
    "I do not think\nthere is anything unbalanced about this business.",
    "I think it has purpose and shall\nwe say method You say that these rucksacks are bought at the shop at the end\nof the road\nYes.",
    "Poirot thanked Mrs Hubbard then left the house and walked down\nHickory Road until he came to the shop.",
    "In the window was a lot of sports\nequipment.",
    "Poirot entered and said he would like to buy a rucksack for his\nnephew who was going hitchhiking.",
    "The man said Ah hitchhiking.",
    "They all do it nowadays all over Europe\nsome of these young people go.",
    "Now here is the usual one we sell.",
    "Good strong\nand really very cheap he said as he wrapped it up.",
    "Poirot paid him and went out with his package.",
    "He had only gone a step or\ntwo when he felt a hand on his shoulder.",
    "Just the man I want to see said Inspector Sharpe.",
    "Theres a place along\nhere where you can get a cup of coffee if youre not busy.",
    "The place was almost empty.",
    "The men carried their cups to a small table in\na corner and Sharpe told Poirot the results of his interviews with the students.",
    "The only person weve got any evidence against is Chapman he said.",
    "And there\nweve got too much.",
    "Three lots of poison in his possession But I doubt he would\nhave been as honest about his activities if he was guilty.",
    "And your hunt through the house  did you find anything\nPatricia Lane in her drawer had a handkerchief covered in green ink.",
    "Green ink Poirot said.",
    "Patricia Lane So it may have been she who\nspilled it over Elizabeth Johnstons papers and then wiped her hands afterwards.",
    "But surely...",
    "Surely she wouldnt want her dear Nigel to be suspected Sharpe finished\nfor him.",
    "But of course someone else might have put the handkerchief in her\ndrawer.",
    "Anything else\nWell it seems Leonard Batesons father is in a mental hospital.",
    "Batesons a\nnice fellow but his temper is a bit well uncontrolled.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Suddenly he remembered Celia Austin saying that it wasnt\nher who cut up the rucksack that it was done with anger.",
    "How did she know it\nwas done with anger Had she seen Len Bateson attacking that rucksack\nBut we didnt find what we wanted.",
    "No forged passports.",
    "You cannot really expect such a thing as a false passport to be left about\nfor you to find my good friend.",
    "Things will only make sense if we begin at the\nbeginning.",
    "What do you call the beginning Poirot\nThe rucksack said Poirot softly.",
    "All this began with a rucksack.",
    "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\nI shall come in as usual on Monday said Mrs Nicoletis to Mrs Hubbard.",
    "I\nwant new electric light bulbs put in the dark passages  stronger ones.",
    "But you said especially that you wanted lowpower bulbs  for economy.",
    "That was last week said Mrs Nicoletis.",
    "Now  it is different.",
    "Now I look\nover my shoulder  and I wonder who is following me.",
    "Mrs Hubbard said Are you sure you ought to go home by yourself\nI shall be safer there than here I can tell you\nBut what is it you are afraid of If I knew perhaps I could \nI tell you nothing.",
    "It is not your business.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "Im sure \nNow you are offended.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis gave her a wide smile.",
    "But\nremember I trust you dear Mrs Hubbard.",
    "Good night.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis went out of the front door down the steps to the gate and\nturned to the left.",
    "At the end of Hickory Road there were traffic lights on the\ncorner and a public house The Queens Head.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis walked in the\nmiddle of the path and occasionally looked over her shoulder but there was no\none there.",
    "When she reached The Queens Head after another quick look she\nstepped inside.",
    "Sipping a double brandy she felt better then turned violently as a voice\nbehind her said Why Mrs Nick I didnt know you came here\nOh its you she said.",
    "I thought...\nWho did you think it was Some big bad man What are you drinking Ill\nget you another.",
    "It is all the worry Mrs Nicoletis explained.",
    "These policemen searching\nmy house.",
    "I do not like drinking but I just thought a little brandy...",
    "Nothing like brandy.",
    "Here you are.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis left The Queens Head a short while later feeling positively\nhappy.",
    "One brandy less perhaps would have been wise but why shouldnt a\nlady have a quiet drink sometimes And if they complained then she would tell\nthem that she knew a thing or two.",
    "So if she decided to talk... Mrs Nicoletis\nstepped sharply aside to avoid a postbox.",
    "Her head did feel a little strange.",
    "Perhaps if she just leant against the wall here for a little If she closed her eyes\nfor a moment or two...\nII\nHercule Poirot was in his sitting room.",
    "Neatly arranged on the table were\nfour rucksacks  the result of instructions given to his servant George.",
    "Poirot\ntook the rucksack he had bought the day before and added it to the others.",
    "It did\nnot seem any different from them but it was very much cheaper.",
    "He examined them all very carefully inside and outside turning them\nupside down feeling the seams the pockets the handles.",
    "Then he picked up a\nsmall sharp knife and turning the rucksack he had bought at Mr Hickss shop\ninside out he attacked the bottom of it.",
    "Between the inner lining and the bottom\nthere was a heavy piece of cloth.",
    "Poirot looked at the rucksack with extreme\ninterest.",
    "Then he began to attack the other rucksacks.",
    "Finally he sat back and took\nout the new list that Mrs Hubbard had given him.",
    "It was as follows\nRucksack Len Batesons\nElectric light bulbs Bracelet Genevieves\nDiamond ring Patricias\nPowder compact Genevieves\nEvening shoe Sallys\n\n\fLipstick Elizabeth Johnstons\nEarrings Valeries\nStethoscope Len Batesons\nBath salts \nScarf cut in pieces Valeries\nTrousers Colins\nCookery book \nBoracic powder Chandra Lais\nCostume brooch Sallys\nInk spilled on Elizabeths notes.",
    "This is the best I can do.",
    "L. Hubbard.",
    "Poirot looked at it for a long time then said to himself Yes... we have to\neliminate the things that do not matter...",
    "He had an idea of who could help him.",
    "It was Sunday so most of the\nstudents would be at home.",
    "He phoned 26 Hickory Road.",
    "A short time later Geronimo opened the door and led the way upstairs into\na goodsized room overlooking Hickory Road.",
    "The bed was decorated with a\nsilk cover and there was some attractive old furniture.",
    "Well you have made this place very nice Miss Hobhouse said Poirot.",
    "It\nhas style.",
    "Valerie smiled.",
    "Ive been here a long time so Ive got some of my own\nthings.",
    "You are not a student are you Mademoiselle\nOh no.",
    "Im one of the buyers for Sabrina Fair  its a beauty salon.",
    "Actually\n\n\fI have a small share in the business.",
    "We also sell a few small things from Paris\nand thats my department.",
    "You go over fairly often to Paris\nAbout once a month sometimes more.",
    "Please do sit down Monsieur\nPoirot.",
    "Poirot sat in a highbacked chair.",
    "Valerie sat on the bed.",
    "She had a nervous\nrather tired beauty and he wondered if her nervousness was the result of the\nrecent inquiry or whether it was a part of her usual manner.",
    "Inspector Sharpe has been asking questions of you he asked.",
    "Yes.",
    "And you have told him all that you know\nOf course.",
    "I wonder he said if that is true.",
    "She gave him a humorous look.",
    "Since you did not hear my answers you\ncant know anything about it.",
    "Ah it is just one of my little ideas.",
    "I have them you know  the little ideas.",
    "They are here.",
    "He touched his head.",
    "But Valerie did not smile as he had expected.",
    "Why dont you get to the\npoint Monsieur Poirot I really dont know what it is you want.",
    "But certainly Miss Hobhouse.",
    "He took from his pocket a little package.",
    "You can guess perhaps what I have in here\nIm not a fortuneteller.",
    "Monsieur Poirot.",
    "I have here the ring that was stolen from Miss Patricia Lane.",
    "Her mothers engagement ring But why do you have it\nI asked her to lend it to me.",
    "I took it to a jeweller friend of mine and I\nasked him to report on the diamond.",
    "A large stone with some small stones on\neither side.",
    "You remember  Mademoiselle\n\n\fNot very well.",
    "But it was in your soup plate.",
    "That was how it was returned I remember that.",
    "I nearly swallowed it.",
    "Valerie gave a short laugh.",
    "Do you know what my friend said about the stone\nHow could I\nHe said that the stone was not a diamond.",
    "It was just a zircon.",
    "Oh Do you mean that  Patricia thought it was a diamond but it was only\na zircon or...\nPoirot was shaking his head.",
    "No I do not mean that.",
    "Miss Lane is a young\nlady of good family and I am certain that the Pappa of Miss Lane would not\nhave given her Mamma anything but a valuable engagement ring.",
    "Therefore it\nseems that the stone must have been changed for another stone later.",
    "I suppose said Valerie that Pat might have lost the stone out of it\ncouldnt afford another diamond so had a zircon put in instead.",
    "That is possible but I do not think it is what happened.",
    "Well what do you think happened\nI think that the ring was taken by Mademoiselle Celia and that the\ndiamond was removed and the zircon put there before the ring was returned.",
    "Valerie sat up very straight.",
    "You think that Celia stole that diamond\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "No I think you stole it Mademoiselle.",
    "Well really You have no evidence for saying that.",
    "But yes Poirot interrupted her.",
    "I have evidence.",
    "The ring was returned in\na plate of soup.",
    "Now me I dined here one evening and the soup was served\nfrom a pot on the side table.",
    "Therefore if anyone found a ring in their soup plate\nit could only have been placed there either by the person who was serving the\n\n\fsoup in this case Geronimo or by the person whose soup plate it was.",
    "You I\nthink that you arranged the return of the ring in the soup in that way because it\namused you.",
    "To hold up the ring To pretend great surprise I think you did not\nunderstand that you told the truth about yourself by so doing.",
    "Is that all Valerie spoke coldly.",
    "Oh no.",
    "You see when Celia spoke of this ring she said I didnt know\nhow valuable it was.",
    "As soon as I knew I returned it.",
    "Who told her how\nvaluable the ring was And then when she spoke of the cut scarf Celia said\nsomething like Valerie didnt mind... Why did you not mind I formed the idea\nthen that the plan of pretending to be a kleptomaniac and so attracting the\nattention of Colin McNabb had been thought out for Celia by someone else.",
    "You\ntold her the ring was valuable you took it from her and arranged its return.",
    "In\nthe same way it was you who suggested that she cut a scarf of yours to pieces.",
    "Valerie gave a short laugh.",
    "Youre quite right.",
    "It was all my idea.",
    "May I ask you why\nOh there was Celia so in love with Colin who never looked at her.",
    "It all\nseemed so silly.",
    "So I spoke to her and explained the idea.",
    "She was a bit nervous\nbut rather excited at the same time.",
    "Then of course one of the first things the\nstupid girl does is to take Pats ring  a really valuable piece of jewellery which\nmight mean that the police would be called in.",
    "So I told her I would return it\nsomehow and that she must just take cheap things and perhaps do a little\ndamage to something of mine which wouldnt get her into trouble.",
    "Poirot drew a deep breath.",
    "That was exactly what I thought.",
    "And now we\ncome to this business of Patricias ring.",
    "Before returning it to her what\nhappened You were short of money was that it\nWithout looking at him she nodded.",
    "The trouble is Monsieur Poirot Im a\ngambler.",
    "I belong to a little club in Mayfair and Ive lost rather a lot recently.",
    "Then I thought if this diamond was replaced with a white zircon Pat would\nnever know the difference So I sold the diamond and replaced it with a zircon.",
    "There Now you know it all.",
    "But honestly I never meant Celia to be blamed for\nit.",
    "No no I understand.",
    "Poirot said.",
    "But you made a great mistake\n\n\fMademoiselle.",
    "I know that said Valerie.",
    "Then she cried out But what does that matter\nnow Tell the police if you like.",
    "Tell Pat.",
    "Tell the world But hows it going to\nhelp us find out who killed Celia Poirot stood up.",
    "One never knows what may\nhelp and what may not.",
    "But I suggest that you go to Miss Patricia Lane and tell\nher what you did.",
    "Valerie did not look happy.",
    "All right.",
    "And Ill tell her that when I can\nafford it Ill buy her another diamond.",
    "The door opened suddenly and Mrs Hubbard came in.",
    "She was breathing\nfast and her expression made Valerie ask Whats the matter Mum Whats\nhappened\nIts Mrs Nicoletis.",
    "Mrs Nick What about her\nOh my dear.",
    "Shes dead.",
    "Dead Valeries voice sounded rough.",
    "How When\nShe was found in the street last night  they took her to the police station.",
    "They thought she was \nDrunk I suppose...",
    "Yes  she had been drinking.",
    "But anyway  she died \nPoor old Mrs Nick said Valerie.",
    "Poirot said gently You were fond of her Mademoiselle\nIts strange  but yes  I was...",
    "When I first came here she wasnt nearly as\n as difficult as she became later.",
    "She was funny warmhearted.",
    "Shes changed a\nlot in the last year \nMrs Hubbard said I do blame myself  letting her go off home alone last\nnight  she was afraid of something.",
    "Afraid Poirot and Valerie said it together.",
    "Mrs Hubbard nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "She kept saying she wasnt safe.",
    "I asked her to\ntell me what she was afraid of  and she refused.",
    "Now  I wonder \nValerie said You dont think that she  that she too was  She stopped a\nlook of fear in her eyes.",
    "Poirot asked What did they say was the cause of death\nMrs Hubbard said They didnt say.",
    "There will be an inquest  on Tuesday \n\n\fCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nIn a quiet room at Scotland Yard four men were sitting round a table.",
    "The policemen were Superintendent Wilding of the Drugs division\nSergeant Bell and Inspector Sharpe.",
    "The fourth man was Hercule Poirot.",
    "On the\ntable was a rucksack.",
    "Its an interesting idea Monsieur Poirot Superintendent Wilding said.",
    "Smuggling goes on all the time of course.",
    "Theres been a lot of heroin coming\ninto this country in the last year and a half.",
    "And what about other things such as jewels\nSergeant Bell spoke.",
    "Theres a lot of it going on sir.",
    "Superintendent\nWilding said But Monsieur Poirot what is it youre interested in drugs or\njewels\nEither.",
    "Anything of great value but small in size.",
    "There is an opportunity\nit seems to me for what you might call a transport service carrying things across\nthe Channel.",
    "It could be a small independent organization unconnected with\nselling the things.",
    "And the profits might be high.",
    "Youre right about that\nYou see said Poirot the weakness of the smuggler is always that sooner\nor later you suspect a person an air hostess a sailing enthusiast the woman who\ntravels to France too often.",
    "But if the things are brought into this country by a\ndifferent person each time then it is very difficult to find the drugs or jewels.",
    "Wilding pointed at the rucksack.",
    "And that is how you think it is done\nYes.",
    "Who is going to suspect a student travelling about with just a\nrucksack on his back And the great cleverness of the arrangement is that the\ncarriers know nothing about what they are doing.",
    "How exactly do you think its managed Wilding asked.",
    "I think that it worked roughly like this first some rucksacks are made.",
    "They look ordinary just like any other rucksack but the lining at the bottom is\ndifferent.",
    "As you see it can easily be removed and below is a space where\njewels or drugs could be hidden.",
    "Wilding said You could bring in drugs worth five or six thousand pounds\neach time without anyone knowing.",
    "Exactly said Hercule Poirot.",
    "The rucksacks are made and put in\nprobably more than one shop for sale.",
    "There is of course probably someone\nwho is himself a student who is in charge of the whole thing.",
    "Students travel.",
    "At\nsome point on the return journey a rucksack that looks just the same is\nexchanged.",
    "The student returns to England arrives back at the hostel unpacks\nand the empty rucksack is thrown into a corner.",
    "At this point the rucksack will\nagain be exchanged.",
    "And you think thats what happened at Hickory Road Poirot nodded.",
    "That is my suspicion.",
    "Yes.",
    "But what made you think of it Monsieur Poirot\nA rucksack was cut to pieces.",
    "Why It was hard work and someone must\nhave been very anxious to do it.",
    "I got my clue when I found that the rucksack\nwas destroyed at the time when a police officer called to see the person in charge\nof the hostel.",
    "The officers call concerned another matter but suppose you are\nsomeone involved in this smuggling you immediately think that the police have\ncome about the smuggling.",
    "And suppose that at that moment there is in the\nhouse a rucksack just brought back from abroad containing drugs.",
    "If there are\ndrugs or jewels in the house they can be hidden in bath salts.",
    "But even an empty\nrucksack if it had held drugs might show signs of heroin if it was examined.",
    "So\nthe rucksack must be destroyed.",
    "It is an idea as I said before said Superintendent Wilding.",
    "It also seems possible that some missing light bulbs may be connected\nwith the rucksack.",
    "Perhaps someone was frightened that his face might be\nknown to the police if they saw him in a bright light.",
    "So he removed the bulb\nfrom the hall light and took away the new ones so that it could not be replaced.",
    "But if what you say is true said Wilding it must go beyond just Hickory\n\n\fRoad\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "The organization must involve many students\nhostels.",
    "You have to find a connection between them said Wilding.",
    "Inspector Sharpe spoke for the first time.",
    "There is such a connection sir.",
    "Or there was.",
    "A woman who owned several hostels Mrs Nicoletis.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "But I suspect she was not in charge of the whole\noperation.",
    "Hm said Wilding.",
    "It would be interesting to know more about Mrs\nNicoletis.",
    "Where is she\nShes dead sir said Sharpe.",
    "Dead Wildings eyes widened.",
    "Yes.",
    "Well know for certain after shes been examined but I think it could\nhave been murder.",
    "And Celia Austin did she know something\nShe knew something said Poirot but I do not think she knew what it was\nshe knew So perhaps she mentioned the fact without understanding that it was\nimportant.",
    "Have you any idea what she knew\nThere has been mention of a passport.",
    "Did someone in the house have a\nfalse passport that allowed them to travel with another name Did she see\nsomeone removing the false bottom from the rucksack Did she perhaps see the\nperson\nwho removed the light bulbs Guesses Guesses Guesses One must know\nmore\nWell said Sharpe we can start by investigating Mrs Nicoletiss\n\n\finvolvement.",
    "But you say she was not in charge of the organization.",
    "Have you\nany idea Monsieur Poirot who that might be\nI could make a guess  I might be wrong.",
    "Yes  I might be wrong\n\n\fCHAPTER SIXTEEN\nPlease Sally may I ask you a question\nSally and Akibombo were having lunch together in a restaurant in Regents\nPark.",
    "All this morning said Akibombo sadly I have been very upset.",
    "I cannot\nanswer my professors questions at all.",
    "He is not pleased with me.",
    "But I find it\nvery hard to think except of what goes on at Hickory Road.",
    "I understand said Sally.",
    "I feel the same.",
    "So that is why I am asking you please to tell me certain things.",
    "This\nboracic it is an acid they say Something very strong\nNo.",
    "Its harmless.",
    "You mean you could put it in your eyes\nThats right.",
    "Thats what people use it for.",
    "Ah that explains that then.",
    "Mr Chandra Lal he has little white bottle with\nwhite powder and he puts powder in hot water and washes his eyes with it.",
    "He\nkeeps it in bathroom and then it was not there one day and he was very angry.",
    "That would be boracic\nWhat is all this about boracic\nIll tell you later.",
    "I need to think some more about it.",
    "Well dont go around telling everyone said Sally.",
    "I dont want yours to be\nthe next dead body Akibombo.",
    "II\nValerie do you think you could give me some advice said Jean.",
    "Its\nabout doing the right thing.",
    "Then Im the last person you should ask.",
    "I never do the right thing  well\nnot often.",
    "Oh Valerie dont say things like that But suppose you know something\nsomething about someone should you should tell the police\nWhat a stupid question You cant answer something like that in general\nterms.",
    "What is it you want to tell or dont want to tell\nIts about a passport.",
    "A passport Valerie sat up.",
    "Whose passport\nNigels.",
    "Hes got a false passport.",
    "I dont believe it.",
    "But he has.",
    "And Valerie suppose Celia found out about it and he killed\nher\nSounds very unlikely.",
    "But how did you see Nigels passport\nWell I was looking for something in my case and by mistake I must have\nlooked in Nigels case.",
    "They were both in the common room.",
    "Valerie laughed rather unkindly.",
    "What were you hoping to find\nNothing I just wasnt thinking properly so I opened the case and I was\njust sorting through it...\nJean thats nonsense.",
    "Nigels case is much bigger than yours and its a\ndifferent colour.",
    "So all right you found a chance to look through Nigels things\nand you did.",
    "Jean stood up.",
    "If youre going to be unpleasant I shall...\nOh sit down said Valerie.",
    "Im getting interested now.",
    "Well there was this passport.",
    "And it had a name on it.",
    "Stanford or Stanley\nand I thought how strange that Nigel has somebody elses passport.",
    "I opened it\nand the photograph inside was Nigel\n\n\fValerie laughed.",
    "Bad luck Jean.",
    "Theres a simple explanation.",
    "Pat told me\nthat Nigel was left some money on the condition that he changed his name.",
    "So\nthats all it is.",
    "His original name was Stanfield or Stanley or something like that.",
    "Oh Jean looked very disappointed.",
    "Better luck next time said Valerie.",
    "I dont know what you mean.",
    "You would like to get Nigel in trouble with the police.",
    "You may not believe me Valerie but all I wanted to do was my duty Jean\nsaid and left the room.",
    "111\nNigel Ive got something I must tell you.",
    "What is it Pat Nigel was looking urgently inside his chest of drawers.",
    "What did I do with my notes\nOh Nigel you must listen Ive got to tell the truth about something.",
    "Not murder I hope Nigel laughed.",
    "Hickory dickory dock the mouse\nran up the clock.",
    "The police said Boo I wonder who will eventually stand in\nthe dock\nNo of course not But one day when I had mended your socks and was\nputting them away in your drawer...",
    "Yes\nAnd the bottle of morphia was there.",
    "The one you told me about Nigel it\nwas there in your drawer where anybody could have found it.",
    "Why Nobody else looks amongst my socks except you.",
    "Well I thought it was wrong so I took the bottle out of the drawer and I\nemptied the poison out of it and I replaced it with some bicarbonate of soda.",
    "You mean that when I told Len and Colin that it was morphine it was just\nbicarbonate of soda But that might make the bet no good\nNigel it was really dangerous keeping it there.",
    "So what did you do with the morphine\nI put it in the bicarbonate of soda bottle and I hid it at the back of my\nhandkerchief drawer.",
    "Nigel shook his head.",
    "Really Pat do you really have a brain What was\nthe point\nI felt it was safer there.",
    "I have a room of my own and you share yours.",
    "I\nwasnt going to tell you about it ever but I must now.",
    "Because you see its\ngone.",
    "Do you mean... Nigel looked shocked.",
    "Theres a bottle with Soda Bic\nwritten on it containing morphine in this place somewhere and at any time\nsomeone might take a spoonful of it if theyve got a stomach pain Why didnt\nyou throw the drug away if you were so upset about it\nBecause I thought it was valuable and ought to go back to the hospital.",
    "As\nsoon as you had won your bet I meant to ask Celia to put it back.",
    "So when did it disappear\nI dont know.",
    "I looked for it the day before Celia died and couldnt find it.",
    "It was gone the day before she died\nI suppose said Patricia her face white that Ive been very stupid.",
    "Nigel\ndo you think I should tell the police\nI suppose so yes.",
    "And its going to be all my fault\nOh no Nigel dear its me.",
    "I \nI was the one who stole it.",
    "It all seemed to be very amusing at the time but\nnow  Look Pat youve probably just forgotten where you put it.",
    "Nigel stood\n\n\fup.",
    "Lets go along to your room and look.",
    "IV\nNigel those are my underclothes.",
    "Really Pat you cant go all shy now.",
    "Down among the panties is just\nwhere you would hide a bottle now isnt it\nYes but Im sure I \nThere was a slight knock on the door and Sally Finch entered.",
    "Her eyes\nwidened.",
    "Pat with a handful of Nigels socks was sitting on the bed and Nigel\nwas digging into a pile of clothes like an excited dog while panties lay all\naround him.",
    "For goodness sake said Sally whats going on\nLooking for bicarbonate said Nigel.",
    "Bicarbonate Why\nIve got a pain he said smiling.",
    "In my stomach.",
    "Ive got some I believe.",
    "No good Sally its got to be Pats.",
    "Hers is the only type that will help my\nparticular problem.",
    "Youre mad said Sally.",
    "You havent seen my bicarbonate have you Sally Pat asked.",
    "No.",
    "Sally paused.",
    "But somebody here  no I cant remember  Have you\ngot a stamp Pat I want to send a letter and I havent got any.",
    "In the drawer there.",
    "Sally opened the drawer found a book of stamps took one and put some\nmoney on the desk.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Shall I post this letter of yours at the same time\n\n\fYes  no I think Ill wait.",
    "When Sally had left the room Pat dropped the socks and twisted her\nfingers nervously together.",
    "Nigel Theres something else Ive got to tell you.",
    "Im\nafraid youll be angry.",
    "Im past being angry.",
    "Im just frightened.",
    "If Celia was poisoned with the\nmorphine that I stole I shall probably go to prison.",
    "Its nothing to do with that.",
    "Its about your father.",
    "What Nigel turned a shocked expression on his face.",
    "You do know hes very ill dont you\nI dont care how ill he is.",
    "It said so on the radio last night.",
    "Sir Arthur Stanley the chemist is in a\nvery bad condition.",
    "So nice to be famous.",
    "All the world hears when youre ill.\nNigel if hes dying you should go to see him.",
    "No I certainly will not He may be dying but hes still the same person\nYou mustnt be like that Nigel.",
    "So unforgiving.",
    "Listen Pat  I told you once he killed my mother.",
    "I know you said so and I know you loved her very much.",
    "But Nigel lots\nof husbands are unkind and it makes their wives unhappy.",
    "But to say your father\nkilled your mother isnt really true.",
    "You know so much about it dont you\nI know that some day youll be sorry that you didnt make peace with your\nfather before he died.",
    "Thats why  Pat paused.",
    "Thats why Ive written to your\nfather  telling him \nYouve written to him Is that the letter Sally wanted to post Nigel\n\n\fwalked over to the desk.",
    "He picked the letter up tore it into small pieces and\nthrew it into the waste paper basket.",
    "Thats that\nReally Nigel you can tear the letter up but you cant stop me writing\nanother.",
    "Youre so stupid.",
    "Did you not understand that when I said my father killed\nmy mother I was stating just a plain fact.",
    "My mother died from taking too much\nof her sleeping medicine.",
    "They said at the inquest that she took it by mistake.",
    "But she didnt take it by mistake.",
    "It was given to her deliberately by my father.",
    "He wanted to marry another woman and my mother wouldnt give him a\ndivorce.",
    "It was plain murder.",
    "What would you have done in my place Told the\npolice My mother wouldnt have wanted that...",
    "So I did the only thing I could\ndo  told him I knew  and left home  for ever.",
    "I even changed my name.",
    "Nigel  Im sorry...",
    "I never dreamed...\nWell you know now... about the respected Arthur Stanley.",
    "But his other\nwoman didnt marry him after all.",
    "I think she guessed what he had done \nNigel dear how awful...\nAll right.",
    "We wont talk of it again.",
    "Lets get back to this bicarbonate\nbusiness.",
    "Now think back carefully to exactly what you did with the stuff.",
    "Think\nPat.",
    "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nSitting in a room at the police station Nigel looked nervously into the eyes\nof Inspector Sharpe.",
    "You understand Mr Chapman that what you have just told us is very\nserious said the Inspector.",
    "Of course I understand.",
    "I wouldnt have come here to tell you about it\nunless I had felt it was important.",
    "And you say Miss Lane cant remember exactly when she last saw this\nbicarbonate bottle containing morphine\nNo but shes trying to make some sense of it now.",
    "We had better go round to Hickory Road immediately.",
    "As the Inspector spoke the telephone rang and the constable who had been\ntaking notes of Nigels story answered.",
    "Its Miss Lane he said.",
    "Wanting to\nspeak to Mr Chapman.",
    "Nigel leaned across the table and took the receiver.",
    "Pat Nigel here.",
    "The girls voice sounded breathless.",
    "Nigel.",
    "I think I know I mean who\nmust have taken  you know  from my handkerchief drawer  you see theres\nonly one person who  The voice broke off.",
    "Pat.",
    "Are you still there Who was it\nI cant tell you now.",
    "Later.",
    "Youll be coming round\nThe receiver was near enough for the Inspector to hear the voice clearly\nand he nodded at Nigel.",
    "Were coming round right now said Nigel.",
    "Oh Good.",
    "Ill be in my room.",
    "Goodbye Pat.",
    "Hardly a word was spoken during the short ride to Hickory Road.",
    "Nigel\nopened the front door and led the way upstairs to\nPats room.",
    "He knocked and entered.",
    "Hello Pat.",
    "Here we  He stopped.",
    "Over Nigels shoulder Sharpe could see Patricia Lane lying on the floor.",
    "He pushed Nigel gently aside then went across to the girl.",
    "He raised her head\nfelt for the pulse then let the head rest back again.",
    "No said Nigel his voice high and unnatural.",
    "No.",
    "No.",
    "No.",
    "Yes Mr Chapman shes dead.",
    "The Inspector stood up.",
    "No no.",
    "Not Pat Dear stupid Pat.",
    "How \nWith this.",
    "It was a simple weapon.",
    "A stone paperweight inside a sock.",
    "Hit\non the back of the head.",
    "If its any help to you\nI dont think she knew what happened to her.",
    "Nigel sat down on the bed.",
    "Thats one of my socks... She was going to\nmend it...",
    "He began to cry like a child.",
    "Do you recognize the paperweight Mr Chapman Sharpe rolled back the\nsock.",
    "Nigel still crying looked.",
    "Pat always had it on her desk a lion.",
    "Suddenly\nhe sat up straight throwing back his untidy fair hair.",
    "Ill kill whoever did this\nIll kill him\nGently Mr Chapman.",
    "Speaking kindly Inspector Sharpe got him out of\nthe room.",
    "Then he went back and leant over the dead girl.",
    "Very carefully he\nremoved something from between her fingers.",
    "II\nGeronimo looked with frightened eyes at the Inspector.",
    "I see nothing.",
    "I\nhear nothing.",
    "I am with Maria in kitchen.",
    "But you can see from the kitchen window who goes in and out cant you\nSharpe said.",
    "Who was in the house from six oclock until six thirtyfive when we\narrived\nEverybody except Mr Nigel and Mrs Hubbard and Miss Hobhouse.",
    "When did they go out\nMrs Hubbard  she go out before teatime she has not come back yet.",
    "Mr\nNigel goes out about half an hour ago just before six  look very upset.",
    "He come\nback with you just now.",
    "Miss Valerie she goes out just at six oclock dressed for\nparty.",
    "She still out.",
    "Sharpe looked down at his notebook.",
    "The time of Patricias call was\nwritten there.",
    "Eight minutes past six exactly.",
    "Everybody else was here Nobody\ncame back during that time\nOnly Miss Sally.",
    "She went down to postbox with letter and come back in.",
    "Do you know what time she came in\nGeronimo thought.",
    "She came back while the news was on the radio.",
    "After six then\nYes sir.",
    "111\nIn her room Mrs Hubbard still in her outdoor clothes sat on the sofa.",
    "I think she telephoned from in here said Sharpe.",
    "Nobody saw or heard\nthe hall telephone being used.",
    "You were out Mrs Hubbard but I dont suppose\nyou lock your door\nMrs Hubbard shook her head.",
    "So Patricia Lane came in here to telephone excited with what she had\nremembered.",
    "Then while she was talking somebody opened the door.",
    "Patricia\npaused and then ended the conversation.",
    "Was that because the person who had\n\n\fcome in was the person whose name she was just about to say And then that\nperson went back to Patricias room with her and perhaps Patricia asked her\nabout taking the bicarbonate.",
    "Mrs Hubbard said sharply Why do you say her\nJust this.",
    "Somebody went into Patricias room with her  someone with\nwhom she felt comfortable.",
    "That points to another girl.",
    "And if the conversation\nearlier between Nigel and Pat was heard it was probably a girl who heard it.",
    "Which girls have the rooms on either side of Patricias\nGenevieves is on the far side  but thats a thick original wall.",
    "Elizabeth\nJohnstons is on the side nearer the stairs.",
    "Thats only a thin wall.",
    "But Ive been told that she was already in the common room when Sally\nFinch went out to post her letter.",
    "She did go upstairs again to get a book.",
    "But\nnobody can say when.",
    "It might have been any of them said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "As far as their statements go yes  but weve got a little extra evidence.",
    "Sharpe took a small paper bag out of his pocket.",
    "Whats that\nTwo hairs  I took them from between Patricia Lanes fingers.",
    "You mean that \nThere was a knock on the door.",
    "Come in said the Inspector.",
    "The door opened.",
    "Please Mr Akibombo said I have a statement to make.",
    "A very important statement about this murder.",
    "CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\nMr Akibombo was offered a chair.",
    "Thank you.",
    "You see sometimes I have\na stomach ache.",
    "Sometimes I take a small pill and sometimes stomach powder.",
    "After that Akibombo smiled I feel much better.",
    "Mrs Hubbard said We understand all about that.",
    "Now get on to the next\npart.",
    "Yes.",
    "Well as I say this happens to me early last week.",
    "It was after supper\nin the common room and only Elizabeth was there and I say to her Have you\nbicarbonate I have finished mine.",
    "And she says No.",
    "But I saw some in Pats\ndrawer when I was putting back a handkerchief I borrowed from her.",
    "I will get it\nfor you.",
    "So she goes upstairs and comes back with a bottle almost empty.",
    "I\nthank her and I put a teaspoon of it in water and drink it.",
    "A teaspoon A teaspoon The Inspector looked at him.",
    "You swallowed a\nteaspoon of morphia\nBut I think it is bicarbonate.",
    "And then afterwards I was ill but really ill.",
    "I cant make out why youre not dead\nMr Akibombo continued.",
    "So then next day when I am better I take the\nbottle and the tiny bit of powder that is left in it to a chemist and I say please tell\nme what is this\nYes\nAnd he says come back later and then he says No wonder This is not\nthe bicarbonate.",
    "It is the boracic.",
    "You can put it in the eyes yes but if you\nswallow a teaspoonful it makes you ill.\nBoracic But how did boracic get into that bottle What happened to the\nmorphia Inspector Sharpe shook his head.",
    "I have been thinking said Akibombo of Miss Celia and how she died\n\n\fand that someone after she was dead must have come into her room and left\nthere the empty morphia bottle and the little piece of paper that say she killed\nherself.",
    "Akibombo paused and the Inspector nodded.",
    "And I think if it is one of the girls it will be easy but if a man not so easy.",
    "So I think and I say suppose it is someone in our house but in the next room to\nMiss Celias Outside his window is a balcony and outside hers is a balcony too.",
    "So if he is big and strong he could jump across.",
    "The room next to Celias in the other house said Mrs Hubbard Well\nthats Nigels and  and...\nLen Batesons.",
    "The Inspectors finger touched the folded paper in his\nhand.",
    "Mr Chandra Lal was very angry when his boracic was not there and later\nwhen I ask he says he has been told that it was taken by Len Bateson...",
    "The morphia was taken from Nigels drawer and boracic was exchanged\nfor it.",
    "Then Patricia Lane came along and exchanged soda bicarbonate for what\nshe thought was morphia but which was really boracic powder...",
    "Yes...",
    "I see...",
    "I have helped you yes Mr Akibombo asked politely.",
    "Yes thank you.",
    "Dont  er  repeat any of this.",
    "No sir.",
    "I will be most careful.",
    "Mr Akibombo left the room.",
    "Len Bateson said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "Oh No.",
    "Hes always seemed so nice.",
    "Thats been said about a lot of criminals said Sharpe.",
    "Gently he opened\nhis little paper bag.",
    "In it were two red curly hairs...\nOh dear said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "CHAPTER NINETEEN\nBut it is beautiful my friend said Hercule Poirot.",
    "So clear  so\nbeautifully clear.",
    "Everything fits in its correct place.",
    "Even these Inspector Sharpe showed Poirot the two red hairs.",
    "Ah  yes the one deliberate mistake.",
    "The two men looked at each other.",
    "For the other investigation my friend it is all fixed \nYes for tomorrow.",
    "You go yourself\nNo.",
    "I plan to appear at 26 Hickory Road.",
    "Cobb will be in charge.",
    "We will wish him good luck said Hercule Poirot\nII\nSergeant Cobb marched boldly into the pink interior of Sabrina Fair\nDetective Constable McCrae behind him.",
    "A beautiful creature moved towards\nthem her feet hardly seeming to touch the floor.",
    "Sergeant Cobb said Good morning Madam and explained why he was\nthere.",
    "The beautiful creature backed away and another beautiful but much older\ncreature with smooth hair and steelgrey eyes appeared.",
    "This is most unusual she said.",
    "Please come this way.",
    "She led him\nthrough the salon into a room with a big desk and several hardbacked chairs.",
    "I\nam Mrs Lucas the owner of this place.",
    "My partner Miss Hobhouse is not here\ntoday.",
    "No Madam said Sergeant Cobb who already knew that.",
    "This is her private office and your search warrant seems to be most\nunnecessary said Mrs Lucas.",
    "He waited politely until she left them alone.",
    "A quarter of an hour later a\nsafe and the drawers of the desk had been searched but they had found nothing.",
    "Looks like we got it wrong said McCrae.",
    "Were only just beginning said Cobb.",
    "He took the drawers one after the\nother and turned them upside down.",
    "Here we are Fastened with tape\nunderneath the bottom drawer were six small darkblue books with gold\nlettering.",
    "Passports.",
    "McCrae watched as Cobb opened the passports and compared the\nphotographs.",
    "You really wouldnt think it was the same woman would you\nThe passports were those of Mrs da Silva Miss Irene French Mrs Olga\nKohn Miss Nina Le Mesurier Mrs Gladys Thomas and Miss Moira ONeele.",
    "The photos were all of a dark young woman between the ages of twentyfive and\nforty.",
    "Its the different hairstyle that does it said Cobb.",
    "I expect shes got bank\naccounts in all these different names.",
    "Bit complicated that\nIt has to be complicated.",
    "Its not so difficult to make money by smuggling\n but its very difficult to account for money when youve got it I bet this little\ngambling club in Mayfair was started by the lady for just that reason.",
    "Winning\nmoney by gambling is about the only thing a tax inspector cant check.",
    "And then\none day she must have left one of these false passports lying about at Hickory\nRoad and poor little Celia saw it.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY\nIt was a clever idea of Miss Hobhouses said Inspector Sharpe moving\nthe passports from one hand to the other like a pack of cards.",
    "Weve had a busy\ntime racing round the banks.",
    "And weve got Monsieur Poirot here to thank for\nworking it out.",
    "It was clever of her too to suggest that stealing trick to poor\nlittle Miss Austin.",
    "You saw it was a trick almost at once didnt you Monsieur\nPoirot\nPoirot smiled.",
    "She could not let pass the chance of possessing that fine\ndiamond in Patricia Lanes ring.",
    "But murder said Mrs Hubbard.",
    "I cant really believe it even now.",
    "We arent able to charge her with the murder yet said Sharpe.",
    "She could\ncertainly have poisoned Mrs Nicoletis  but she definitely did not kill Patricia\nLane.",
    "The chemist at the corner of the road says she came in at five minutes past\nsix and bought face powder and aspirin and used the telephone.",
    "She left his shop\nat quarterpast six.",
    "Poirot sat up in his chair.",
    "But that is perfect It is just what we want\nWhat do you mean\nI mean that she telephoned from the chemists shop.",
    "Inspector Sharpe looked at him.",
    "Now Monsieur Poirot lets not forget the\nfacts.",
    "At eight minutes past six Patricia Lane is alive and telephoning to the\npolice station from this room.",
    "You agree\nI do not think she was telephoning from this room.",
    "Well then from downstairs.",
    "Not from downstairs either.",
    "Inspector Sharpe shook his head.",
    "You do agree that a call was received at\n\n\fthe police station\nCertainly.",
    "A call was received by you.",
    "A call that came from the public\ncallbox at the chemists.",
    "Inspector Sharpes mouth dropped open.",
    "You mean that Valerie Hobhouse\nmade that call That she pretended to speak as Patricia Lane and that Patricia\nLane was already dead.",
    "That is what I mean yes.",
    "The Inspector was silent for a moment then his hand came down with a\ncrash on the table.",
    "I dont believe it.",
    "The voice  I heard it myself \nYou heard it yes.",
    "A girls voice.",
    "But you didnt know Patricia Lanes voice\nwell enough to say that it was her voice.",
    "I didnt perhaps.",
    "But Nigel Chapman would have known if it wasnt Pats\nvoice.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "Nigel Chapman would have known.",
    "Nigel Chapman\nknew very well that it wasnt Patricia.",
    "Who would know better than he as he had\nkilled her only a short while before.",
    "It was a moment or two before the Inspector spoke.",
    "Nigel Chapman But\nwhen we found her dead he cried like a child.",
    "I expect he did said Poirot.",
    "I think he cared about that girl as much as he\ncould care for anybody  but that wouldnt save her  not if she was a threat to his\ninterests.",
    "All along Nigel Chapman has been the most likely murderer.",
    "Who had\nmorphia in his possession Nigel Chapman.",
    "Who had the sharp intelligence to\nplan and the nerve to commit murder Nigel Chapman.",
    "Who cares nothing for\nanyone but himself Nigel Chapman.",
    "He even wanted to draw attention to\nhimself  using the green ink and even by the silly deliberate mistake of putting\nLen Batesons hairs in Patricias fingers.",
    "He didnt care that as Patricia was hit\nfrom behind she could not possibly have pulled her attackers hair.",
    "They are like\nthat these murderers excited by their love of their own cleverness and charm for he has charm this Nigel  all the charm of a spoiled child who has never\ngrown up who never will grow up  who sees only one thing himself and what\nhe wants\n\n\fBut why Monsieur Poirot Why murder Celia Austin perhaps but why\nPatricia Lane\nThat said Poirot we have got to find out.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY ONE\nI havent seen you for a long time said old Mr Endicott to Hercule Poirot.",
    "Its very nice of you to call.",
    "Not really said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I want something.",
    "Well as you know I am very grateful to you.",
    "You cleared up that\nunpleasant Abernethie business for me.",
    "The old lawyer smiled.",
    "Sir Arthur Stanley was a good friend was he not\nYes.",
    "And weve looked after his legal work since he was young.",
    "His death was mentioned on the six oclock news yesterday I believe.",
    "Yes.",
    "The funerals on Friday.",
    "Lady Stanley died some years ago\nTwo and a half years ago.",
    "He looked sharply at Poirot.",
    "How did she die\nToo much of a sleeping drug.",
    "The inquest found that she took it\naccidentally.",
    "Did she\nMr Endicott was silent for a moment.",
    "It seems so.",
    "There was no\nsuggestion of suicide.",
    "And no suggestion of  anything else\nAgain he looked sharply at Poirot.",
    "Her husband said that she did\nsometimes get confused after taking the drug and ask for more.",
    "Was he lying\n\n\fReally Poirot why do you think that I could possibly know\nPoirot smiled.",
    "I think my friend that you know very well.",
    "But I will not\nembarrass you by asking you that.",
    "Instead I will\nask you for an opinion.",
    "Was Arthur Stanley the type of man who would\nkill his wife if he wanted to marry another woman\nMr Endicott was shocked.",
    "Certainly not And there was no other woman.",
    "Stanley loved his wife.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "I thought so.",
    "And now I will tell you the purpose of my\ncall.",
    "Arthur Stanley had a son.",
    "The son quarrelled with his father at the time of\nhis mothers death and then left home.",
    "He even changed his name.",
    "That I did not know.",
    "So did Arthur Stanley leave a letter with you a letter to be opened under\ncertain conditions or after his death\nPoirot how can you possibly know the things you do\nI am right then I think there were two choices in the letter.",
    "It was either to\nbe destroyed  or you were to perform a certain action.",
    "This matter is private.",
    "Even from you Poirot  Mr Endicott shook his\nhead.",
    "And if I show you good cause why you should speak\nHow can you possibly know anything at all about this matter Poirot took\na deep breath.",
    "It is in my mind that your instructions are these.",
    "If Sir Arthur\ndies you are to find his son Nigel and discover if he is involved in any criminal\nactivity.",
    "This time Mr Endicott gave a sharp sound of surprise.",
    "Well as you\nseem to know all about it Ill tell you anything you want to know.",
    "You must have\nmet young Nigel in the course of your professional activities.",
    "Whats he done\nnow\nI think the story goes like this.",
    "After he had left home he changed his\nname.",
    "He then met some people who were involved in smuggling  drugs and\n\n\fjewels.",
    "I think it was his idea to use innocent students to carry things.",
    "The whole\noperation was organized by two people Nigel Chapman as he now called\nhimself and a young woman called Valerie Hobhouse.",
    "Everything went well\nuntil one day a police officer came to a students hostel to ask questions about a\nmurder near Cambridge.",
    "But Nigel thought the police were after him.",
    "He\nremoved certain electric bulbs so that the light would be faint and he also took a\ncertain rucksack outside cut it to pieces and threw it behind the boiler.",
    "He was\nafraid some remains of drugs might be found in its false bottom.",
    "His fear was\nunnecessary but one of the girls in the hostel had happened to look out of her\nwindow and had seen him destroying the rucksack.",
    "That did not immediately\nmean she had to die.",
    "Instead she was persuaded to commit certain stupid actions\nwhich would put her in a difficult position.",
    "But they pushed that idea too far.",
    "I\nwas called in.",
    "I advised going to the police.",
    "The girl was frightened and admitted what\nshe had done.",
    "But only the things she had done.",
    "And she went I think to Nigel\nand urged him to admit to the rucksack business and to spilling ink over a fellow\nstudents work.",
    "Neither Nigel nor Valerie could consider calling attention to the\nrucksack  their whole plan would be ruined.",
    "Celia the young girl she knew too\nmuch.",
    "The next evening she went out to meet Nigel somewhere.",
    "He gave her\nsome coffee and in it was morphia.",
    "She died in her sleep with everything\narranged to look like suicide.",
    "An expression of deep upset crossed Mr Endicotts face.",
    "But that was not the end said Poirot.",
    "The woman who owned the hostels\ndied soon after and then finally there came the last most cruel and heartless\ncrime.",
    "Patricia Lane a girl who loved Nigel told him that he should go to see\nhis father before he died.",
    "He told her some lies about his family and destroyed\nher letter to his father but he knew that she might write a second letter.",
    "I think\nmy friend that you can tell me why that would have been such a deadly thing to\nhappen.",
    "Mr Endicott stood up went across to a safe unlocked it and came back\nwith a long envelope in his hand.",
    "He took out two letters and laid them before\nPoirot.",
    "Dear Endicott\n\n\fYou will open this after I am dead.",
    "I wish you to find my son Nigel and\ndiscover if he has been guilty of any criminal actions.",
    "Nigel has twice been guilty of forging my name to a cheque.",
    "On each\noccasion I said the signature was mine but warned him that I would not do so\nagain.",
    "On the third occasion it was his mothers name he forged.",
    "He asked her to\nkeep silent.",
    "She refused.",
    "It was then that he put an extra amount of her sleeping\nmixture into her glass.",
    "Before she fell asleep however she had told me about the\ncheque.",
    "When the next morning she was found dead I knew who had done it.",
    "I told Nigel that I intended to go to the police.",
    "He was very upset and kept\nasking me not to.",
    "What would you have done Endicott I know my son is one of\nthose dangerous people who have no sense of pity.",
    "I had no reason to save him.",
    "But it was the thought of my wife that decided me.",
    "Would she wish me to bring\nour son to justice I thought that I knew the answer  she would have wanted him\nsaved.",
    "But I firmly believe that once a killer always a killer.",
    "There might be in\nthe future other victims.",
    "I made a deal with my son and whether I did right or\nwrong I do not know.",
    "He was to write out a confession of his crime which I\nwould keep.",
    "He was to leave my house and never return.",
    "I would give him a\nsecond chance.",
    "Money belonging to his mother would come to him.",
    "He had had\na good education.",
    "He had every chance of making a better life for himself.",
    "But  if he committed any criminal activity at all the confession he had left\nwith me would go to the police.",
    "I also made myself safe because my own death\nwould not prevent that happening.",
    "You are my oldest friend.",
    "Find Nigel.",
    "If his record is clean destroy both\nthese letters.",
    "If not  then justice must be done.",
    "Your loving friend\nArthur Stanley\nAh Poirot breathed out and unfolded the other piece of paper.",
    "I hereby confess that I murdered my mother by giving her an extra amount\nof her sleeping medicine on November 18th.",
    "Nigel Stanley\n\n\fCHAPTER TWENTY TWO\nYou understand your position Miss Hobhouse.",
    "I have already warned you\n\nValerie Hobhouse interrupted Sharpe.",
    "That what I say will be used in\nevidence.",
    "Im prepared for that.",
    "Youve got me on the smuggling charge.",
    "But this\nother information means that Ill be charged in connection with a murder.",
    "Making a statement may help you but I cant promise that.",
    "I dont really care.",
    "I never intended murder or wanted it.",
    "What I do want is\na clear case against Nigel... Celia knew too much but I could have managed\nthat.",
    "Nigel didnt give me time.",
    "He killed her and then told me what he had done.",
    "The same thing happened with Mrs Nick.",
    "He had found out that she drank that\nshe couldnt be trusted  so he met her somewhere on her way home and\npoisoned her drink.",
    "Then there was Pat.",
    "He came up to my room and told me\nwhat had happened.",
    "He told me what I had to do  so that both he and I would\nhave an alibi.",
    "I was caught by then... but now I only care about one thing  to\nmake sure that Nigel gets punished.",
    "Im not sure that I understand... began Sharpe.",
    "You dont need to understand.",
    "Ive got my reasons.",
    "Hercule Poirot spoke very gently.",
    "Mrs Nicoletis she was  your mother\nwas she not\nYes said Valerie Hobhouse.",
    "She was my mother...\n\n\fCHAPTER TWENTY THREE\nI do not understand.",
    "Mr Akibombo looked from one red head to the other.",
    "Do you think asked Sally Finch that Nigel meant me to be suspected or\nyou\nEither I expect replied Len Bateson.",
    "I believe he took the hairs from my\nbrush.",
    "Was it then Mr Nigel who jumped the balcony asked Mr Akibombo.",
    "Nigel can jump like a cat said Len.",
    "I couldnt have jumped across that\nspace.",
    "Im much too heavy.",
    "I want to apologize for my suspicions said Akibombo.",
    "Thats all right said Len.",
    "In fact you helped a lot said Sally.",
    "All your thinking  about the boracic.",
    "He smiled.",
    "If you meet my professor at the University party tonight will\nyou tell him please that I have done some good thinking\nIll tell him said Sally.",
    "Len Bateson was looking unhappy.",
    "In a weeks time youll be back in\nAmerica.",
    "I shall come back.",
    "Or you might come and study over there.",
    "Whats the use\nAkibombo said Sally would you like one day to be best man at a\nwedding\nWhat do you mean best man\n\n\fThe bridegroom for example Len here gives you a ring to keep for him\nand he and you go to church very smartly dressed and at the right moment he\nasks you for the ring and you give it to him and he puts it on my finger and then\nthe wedding march is played and everybody cries.",
    "And there we are.",
    "You mean that you and Mr Len are to be married\nThats the idea.",
    "Sally\nUnless of course Len doesnt like the idea.",
    "Sally If you only knew how happy youve made me.",
    "I do have just a tiny suspicion.",
    "II\nHercule Poirot signed the last of the letters that Miss Lemon had laid\nbefore him.",
    "Very good he said.",
    "Not a single mistake.",
    "I dont often make mistakes I hope Miss Lemon said.",
    "Not often.",
    "But it has happened.",
    "How is your sister by the way\nShe is thinking of going on a cruise.",
    "Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Ah.",
    "Hercule Poirot wondered if  possibly  on a cruise  Not that he\nhimself would ever go on one  not for any reason...",
    "The clock behind him struck\none.",
    "The clock struck one\nThe mouse ran down\nHickory dickory dock said Hercule Poirot.",
    "What was that Monsieur Poirot\n\n\fNothing said Hercule Poirot."
