    "Cards on the Table\nAgatha Christie\n1936\n\n\f2\n\n\fChapter 1\nMr. Shaitana\n\u201cMy dear Monsieur Poirot\u201d\nIt was a soft purring voice \u2010 a voice used deliberately as an instrument \u2010 nothing impulsive\nor unpremeditated about it.",
    "Hercule Poirot swung round.",
    "He bowed.",
    "He shook hands ceremoniously.",
    "There was something in his eye that was unusual.",
    "One would have said that this chance\nencounter awakened in him an emotion that he seldom had occasion to feel.",
    "\u201cMy dear Mr. Shaitana\u201d he said.",
    "They both paused.",
    "They were like duelists en garde.",
    "Around them a well\u2010dressed languid London crowd eddied mildly.",
    "Voices drawled or\nmurmured.",
    "\u201cDarling \u2010 exquisite\u201d\n\u201cSimply divine aren\u2019t they my dear\u201d\nIt was the Exhibition of Snuffboxes at Wessex House.",
    "Admission one guinea in aid of the\nLondon hospitals.",
    "\u201cMy dear man\u201d said Mr. Shaitana \u201chow nice to see you Not hanging or guillotining much\njust at present Slack season in the criminal world Or is there to be a robbery here this\nafternoon That would be too delicious.\u201d\n\u201cAlas monsieur\u201d said Poirot \u201cI am here in a purely private capacity.\u201d\nMr. Shaitana was diverted for a moment by a Lovely Young Thing with tight poodle curls\nup one side of her head and three cornucopias in black straw on the other.",
    "He said \u201cMy\ndear \u2010 why didn\u2019t you come to my party It really was a marvellous party Quite a lot of\npeople actually spoke to me One woman even said \u2018How do you do\u2019 and \u2018Good\u2010by\u2019 and\n\u2018Thank you so much\u2019 \u2010 but of course she came from a Garden City poor dear\u201d\nWhile the Lovely Young Thing made a suitable reply Poirot allowed himself a good study\nof the hirsute adornment on Mr. Shaitana\u2019s upper lip.",
    "A fine moustache \u2010 a very fine moustache \u2010 the only moustache in London perhaps that\ncould compete with that of Monsieur Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut it is not so luxuriant\u201d he murmured to himself.",
    "\u201cNo decidedly it is inferior in every\nrespect.",
    "Tout de m\u00eame it catches the eye.\u201d\n3\n\n\fThe whole of Mr. Shaitana\u2019s person caught the eye \u2010 it was designed to do so.",
    "He\ndeliberately attempted a Mephistophelean effect.",
    "He was tall and thin his face was long\nand melancholy his eyebrows were heavily accented and jet black he wore a moustache\nwith stiff waxed ends and a tiny black imperial.",
    "His clothes were works of art \u2010 of exquisite\ncut \u2010 but with a suggestion of the bizarre.",
    "Every healthy Englishman who saw him longed earnestly and fervently to kick him They\nsaid with a singular lack of originality \u201cThere\u2019s that damned Shaitana\u201d Their wives\ndaughters sisters aunts mothers and even grandmothers said varying the idiom\naccording to their generation words to this effect \u2010 \u201cI know my dear.",
    "Of course he is too\nterrible.",
    "But so rich And such marvellous parties And he\u2019s always got something amusing\nand spiteful to tell you about people.\u201d\nWhether Mr. Shaitana was an Argentine or a Portuguese or a Greek or some other\nnationality nobody knew.",
    "But three facts were quite certain.",
    "He existed richly and beautifully in a super flat in Park Lane.",
    "He gave wonderful parties \u2010\nlarge parties small parties macabre parties respectable parties and definitely \u201cqueer\u201d\nparties.",
    "He was a man of whom nearly everybody was a little afraid.",
    "Why this last was so can hardly be stated in definite words.",
    "There was a feeling perhaps\nthat he knew a little too much about everybody.",
    "And there was a feeling too that his\nsense of humour was a curious one.",
    "People nearly always felt that it would be better not to risk offending Mr. Shaitana.",
    "It was his humour this afternoon to bait that ridiculous looking little man Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cSo even a policeman needs recreation\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou study the arts in your old age\nMonsieur Poirot.\u201d\nPoirot smiled good\u2010humouredly.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d he said \u201cthat you yourself have lent three snuffboxes to the exhibition.\u201d\nMr. Shaitana waved a deprecating hand.",
    "\u201cOne picks up trifles here and there.",
    "You must\ncome to my flat one day.",
    "I have some interesting pieces.",
    "I do not confine myself to any\nparticular period or class of object.\u201d\n\u201cYour tastes are catholic\u201d said Poirot smiling.",
    "\u201cAs you say.\u201d\nSuddenly Mr. Shaitana\u2019s eyes danced the corners of his lips curled up his eyebrows\nassumed a fantastic tilt.",
    "4\n\n\f\u201cI could even show you objects in your own line Monsieur Poirot\u201d\n\u201cYou have then a private \u2018Black Museum\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBah\u201d Mr. Shaitana snapped disdainful fingers.",
    "\u201cThe cup used by the Brighton murderer\nthe jimmy of a celebrated burglar \u2010 absurd childishness I should never burden myself with\nrubbish like that.",
    "I collect only the best objects of their kind.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you consider the best objects artistically speaking in crime\u201d inquired\nPoirot.",
    "Mr. Shaitana leaned forward and laid two fingers on Poirot\u2019s shoulder.",
    "He hissed his words\ndramatically.",
    "\u201cThe human beings who commit them Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s eyebrows rose a trifle.",
    "\u201cAha I have startled you\u201d said Mr. Shaitana.",
    "\u201cMy dear dear man you and I look on these\nthings as from poles apart For you crime is a matter of routine \u2010 a murder an\ninvestigation a due and ultimately for you are undoubtedly an able fellow a conviction.",
    "Such banalities would not interest me I am not interested in poor specimens of any kind.",
    "And the caught murderer is necessarily one of the failures.",
    "He is second rate.",
    "No I look on\nthe matter from the artistic point of view.",
    "I collect only the best\u201d\n\u201cThe best being \u2010\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cMy dear fellow \u2010 the ones who have got away with it The successes The criminals who\nlead an agreeable life which no breath of suspicion has ever touched.",
    "Admit that is an\namusing hobby.\u201d\n\u201cIt was another word I was thinking of \u2010 not amusing.\u201d\n\u201cAn idea\u201d cried Shaitana paying no attention to Poirot.",
    "\u201cA little dinner A dinner to meet\nmy exhibits Really that is a most amusing thought.",
    "I cannot think why it has never\noccurred to me before.",
    "Yes \u2010 yes I see it all \u2010 I see it exactly.",
    "You must give me a little time\n\u2010 not next week \u2010 let us say the week after next.",
    "You are free What day shall we say\u201d\n\u201cAny day of the week after next would suit me\u201d said Poirot with a bow.",
    "\u201cGood then let us say Friday.",
    "Friday the eighteenth that will be.",
    "I will write it down at\nonce in my little book.",
    "Really the idea pleases me enormously.\u201d\n\u201cI am not quite sure if it pleases me\u201d said Poirot slowly.",
    "\u201cI do not mean that I am\ninsensible to the kindness of your invitation \u2010 no \u2010 not that \u2010\u201d\nShaitana interrupted him.",
    "\u201cBut it shocks your bourgeois sensibilities My dear fellow you\nmust free yourself from the limitations of the policeman mentality.\u201d\nPoirot said slowly \u201cIt is true that I have a thoroughly bourgeois attitude to murder.\u201d\n5\n\n\f\u201cBut my dear why A stupid bungled butchering business \u2010 yes I agree with you.",
    "But\nmurder can be an art A murderer can be an artist.\u201d\n\u201cOh I admit it.\u201d\n\u201cWell then\u201d Mr. Shaitana asked.",
    "\u201cBut he is still a murderer\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSurely my dear Monsieur Poirot to do a thing supremely well is a justification You want\nvery unimaginatively to take every murderer handcuff him shut him up and eventually\nbreak his neck for him in the early hours of the morning.",
    "In my opinion a really successful\nmurderer should be granted a pension out of the public funds and asked out to dinner\u201d\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cI am not as insensitive to art in crime as you think.",
    "I can\nadmire the perfect murderer I can also admire a tiger \u2010 that splendid tawny striped beast.",
    "But I will admire him from outside his cage.",
    "I will not go inside.",
    "That is to say not unless it\nis my duty to do so.",
    "For you see Mr. Shaitana the tiger might spring.\u201d\nMr. Shaitana laughed.",
    "\u201cI see.",
    "And the murderer\u201d\n\u201cMight murder\u201d said Poirot gravely.",
    "\u201cMy dear fellow \u2010 what an alarmist you are Then you will not come to meet my collection\nof \u2010 tigers\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary I shall be enchanted.\u201d\n\u201cHow brave\u201d\n\u201cYou do not quite understand me Mr. Shaitana.",
    "My words were in the nature of a\nwarning.",
    "You asked me just now to admit that your idea of a collection of murderers was\namusing.",
    "I said I could think of another word other than amusing.",
    "That word was\ndangerous.",
    "I fancy Mr. Shaitana that your hobby might be a dangerous one\u201d\nMr. Shaitana laughed a very Mephistophelean laugh.",
    "He said \u201cI may expect you then on the eighteenth\u201d\nPoirot gave a little bow.",
    "\u201cYou may expect me on the eighteenth.",
    "Mille remerciments.\u201d\n\u201cI shall arrange a little party\u201d replied Shaitana.",
    "\u201cDo not forget.",
    "Eight o\u2019clock.\u201d\nHe moved away.",
    "Poirot stood a minute or two looking after him.",
    "He shook his head slowly and thoughtfully.",
    "6\n\n\fChapter 2\nDinner at Mr. Shaitana\u2019s\nThe door of Mr. Shaitana\u2019s flat opened noiselessly.",
    "A gray\u2010haired butler drew it back to let\nPoirot enter.",
    "He closed it equally noiselessly and deftly relieved the guest of his overcoat\nand hat.",
    "He murmured in a low expressionless voice \u201cWhat name shall I say\u201d\n\u201cMonsieur Hercule Poirot.\u201d\nThere was a little hum of talk that eddied out into the hall as the butler opened a door and\nannounced \u201cMonsieur Hercule Poirot.\u201d\nSherry glass in hand Shaitana came forward to meet him.",
    "He was as usual immaculately\ndressed.",
    "The Mephistophelean suggestion was heightened tonight the eyebrows seemed\naccentuated in their mocking twist.",
    "\u201cLet me introduce you \u2010 do you know Mrs. Oliver\u201d\nThe showman in him enjoyed the little start of surprise that Poirot gave.",
    "Mrs. Ariadne Oliver was extremely well known as one of the foremost writers of detective\nand other sensational stories.",
    "She wrote chatty if not particularly grammatical articles on\n\u201cThe Tendency of the Criminal\u201d \u201cFamous Crimes Passionnels\u201d \u201cMurder for Love v.\nMurder for Gain.\u201d She was also a hot\u2010headed feminist and when any murder of\nimportance was occupying space in the press there was sure to be an interview with Mrs.\nOliver and it was mentioned that Mrs. Oliver had said \u201cNow if a woman were the head of\nScotland Yard\u201d She was an earnest believer in woman\u2019s intuition.",
    "For the rest she was an agreeable woman of middle age handsome in a rather untidy\nfashion with fine eyes substantial shoulders and a large quantity of rebellious gray hair\nwith which she was continually experimenting.",
    "One day her appearance would be highly\nintellectual \u2010 a brow with the hair scraped back from it and coiled in a large bun in the\nneck on another Mrs. Oliver would suddenly appear with Madonna loops or large\nmasses of slightly untidy curls.",
    "On this particular evening Mrs. Oliver was trying out a\nfringe.",
    "She greeted Poirot whom she had met before at a literary dinner in an agreeable bass\nvoice.",
    "\u201cAnd Superintendent Battle you doubtless know\u201d said Mr. Shaitana.",
    "A big square wooden\u2010faced man moved forward.",
    "Not only did an onlooker feel that\nSuperintendent Battle was carved out of wood \u2010 he also managed to convey the\nimpression that the wood in question was the timber out of a battleship.",
    "7\n\n\fSuperintendent Battle was supposed to be Scotland Yard\u2019s best representative.",
    "He always\nlooked stolid and rather stupid.",
    "\u201cI know Monsieur Poirot\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "And his wooden face creased into a smile and then returned to its former\ninexpressiveness.",
    "\u201cColonel Race\u201d went on Mr. Shaitana.",
    "Poirot had not previously met Colonel Race but he\nknew something about him.",
    "A dark handsome deeply bronzed man of fifty he was\nusually to be found in some outpost of Empire \u2010 especially if there were trouble brewing.",
    "Secret Service is a melodramatic term but it described pretty accurately to the lay mind\nthe nature and scope of Colonel Race\u2019s activities.",
    "Poirot had by now taken in and appreciated the particular essence of his host\u2019s humorous\nintentions.",
    "\u201cOur other guests are late\u201d said Mr. Shaitana.",
    "\u201cMy fault perhaps.",
    "I believe I told them\neight\u2010fifteen.\u201d\nBut at that moment the door opened and the butler announced \u201cDoctor Roberts.\u201d\nThe man who came in did so with a kind of parody of a brisk bedside manner.",
    "He was a\ncheerful highly coloured individual of middle age.",
    "Small twinkling eyes a touch of\nbaldness a tendency of embonpoint and a general air of a well\u2010scrubbed and disinfected\nmedical practitioner.",
    "His manner was cheerful and confident.",
    "You felt that his diagnosis\nwould be correct and his treatments agreeable and practical \u2010 \u201ca little champagne in\nconvalescence perhaps.\u201d A man of the world\n\u201cNot late I hope\u201d said Doctor Roberts genially.",
    "He shook hands with his host and was introduced to the others.",
    "He seemed particularly\ngratified at meeting Battle.",
    "\u201cWhy you\u2019re one of the big noises at Scotland Yard aren\u2019t\nyou This is interesting Too bad to make you talk shop but I warn you I shall have a try at\nit.",
    "Always been interested in crime.",
    "Bad thing for a doctor perhaps.",
    "Mustn\u2019t say so to my\nnervous patients \u2010 ha ha\u201d\nAgain the door opened.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer was a well\u2010dressed woman of sixty.",
    "She had lovely cut features beautifully\narranged gray hair and a clear incisive voice.",
    "\u201cI hope I\u2019m not late\u201d she said advancing to her host.",
    "She turned from him to greet Doctor\nRoberts with whom she was acquainted.",
    "The butler announced \u201cMajor Despard.\u201d\n\n8\n\n\fMajor Despard was a tall lean handsome man his face slightly marred by a scar on the\ntemple.",
    "Introductions completed he gravitated naturally to the side of Colonel Race \u2010 and\nthe two men were soon talking sport and comparing their experiences on safari.",
    "For the last time the door opened and the butler announced \u201cMiss.",
    "Meredith.\u201d\nA girl in the early twenties entered.",
    "She was of medium height and pretty.",
    "Brown curls\nclustered in her neck her gray eyes were large and wide apart.",
    "Her face was powdered\nbut not made up.",
    "Her voice was slow and rather shy.",
    "She said \u201cOh dear am I the last\u201d\nMr. Shaitana descended on her with sherry and an ornate and complimentary reply.",
    "His\nintroductions were formal and almost ceremonious.",
    "Miss.",
    "Meredith was left sipping her sherry by Poirot\u2019s side.",
    "\u201cOur friend is very punctilious\u201d said Poirot with a smile.",
    "The girl agreed.",
    "\u201cI know.",
    "People rather dispense with introductions nowadays.",
    "They just\nsay \u2018I expect you know everybody\u2019 and leave it at that.\u201d\n\u201cWhether you do or you don\u2019t\u201d\n\u201cWhether you do or don\u2019t.",
    "Sometimes it makes it awkward \u2010 but I think this is more awe\ninspiring.\u201d\nShe hesitated and then said \u201cIs that Mrs. Oliver the novelist\u201d\nMrs. Oliver\u2019s bass voice rose powerfully at that minute speaking to Doctor Roberts.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t get away from a woman\u2019s instinct Doctor.",
    "Women know these things.\u201d\nForgetting that she no longer had a brow she endeavoured to sweep her hair back from it\nbut was foiled by the fringe.",
    "\u201cThat is Mrs. Oliver\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe one who wrote The Body in the Library\u201d\n\u201cThat identical one.\u201d\nMiss.",
    "Meredith frowned a little.",
    "\u201cAnd that wooden\u2010looking man \u2010 a superintendent did Mr. Shaitana say\u201d\n\u201cFrom Scotland Yard.\u201d\n9\n\n\f\u201cAnd you\u201d\n\u201cAnd me\u201d\n\u201cI know all about you Monsieur Poirot.",
    "It was you who really solved the A.B.C.",
    "crimes.\u201d\n\u201cMademoiselle you cover me with confusion.\u201d\nMiss.",
    "Meredith drew her brows together.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Shaitana\u201d she began and then stopped.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Shaitana \u2010\u201d\nPoirot said quietly \u201cOne might say he was \u2018crime minded.\u2019 It seems so.",
    "Doubtless he\nwishes to hear us dispute ourselves.",
    "He is already egging on Mrs. Oliver and Doctor\nRoberts.",
    "They are now discussing untraceable poisons.\u201d\nMiss.",
    "Meredith gave a little gasp as she said \u201cWhat a queer man he is\u201d\n\u201cDoctor Roberts\u201d\n\u201cNo Mr. Shaitana.\u201d\nShe shivered a little and said \u201cThere\u2019s always something a little frightening about him I\nthink.",
    "You never know what would strike him as amusing.",
    "It might \u2010 it might be something\ncruel\u201d\n\u201cSuch as fox hunting eh\u201d\nMiss.",
    "Meredith threw him a reproachful glance.",
    "\u201cI meant \u2010 oh something Oriental\u201d\n\u201cHe has perhaps the tortuous mind\u201d admitted Poirot.",
    "\u201cTorturer\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cNo no tortuous I said.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I like him frightfully\u201d confided Miss.",
    "Meredith her voice dropping.",
    "\u201cYou will like his dinner though\u201d Poirot assured her.",
    "\u201cHe has a marvellous cook.\u201d\nShe looked at him doubtfully and then laughed.",
    "\u201cWhy\u201d she exclaimed \u201cI believe you are\nquite human\u201d\n\u201cBut certainly I am human\u201d\n\u201cYou see\u201d said Miss.",
    "Meredith \u201call these celebrities are rather intimidating.\u201d\n10\n\n\f\u201cMademoiselle you should not be intimidated \u2010 you should be thrilled You should have\nall ready your autograph book and your fountain pen.\u201d\n\u201cWell you see I\u2019m not really terribly interested in crime.",
    "I don\u2019t think women are it\u2019s\nalways men who read detective stories.\u201d\nHercule Poirot sighed affectedly.",
    "\u201cAlas\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cWhat would I not give at this minute to be even the most minor of\nfilm stars\u201d\nThe butler threw the door open.",
    "\u201cDinner is served\u201d he announced.",
    "Poirot\u2019s prognostication was amply justified.",
    "The dinner was delicious and its serving\nperfection.",
    "Subdued light polished wood the blue gleam of Irish glass.",
    "In the dimness at\nthe head of the table Mr. Shaitana looked more than ever diabolical.",
    "He apologized gracefully for the uneven number of the sexes.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer was on his\nright hand Mrs. Oliver on his left.",
    "Miss.",
    "Meredith was between Superintendent Battle and\nMajor Despard.",
    "Poirot was between Mrs. Lorrimer and Doctor Roberts.",
    "The latter murmured facetiously to him \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be allowed to monopolize\nthe only pretty girl all the evening.",
    "You French fellows you don\u2019t waste your time do\nyou\u201d\n\u201cI happen to be Belgian\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cSame thing where the ladies are concerned I expect my boy\u201d said the doctor cheerfully.",
    "Then dropping the facetiousness and adopting a professional tone he began to talk to\nColonel Race on his other side about the latest developments in the treatment of sleeping\nsickness.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer turned to Poirot and began to talk of the latest plays.",
    "Her judgments were\nsound and her criticisms apt.",
    "They drifted on to books and then to world politics.",
    "He found\nher a well\u2010informed and thoroughly intelligent woman.",
    "On the opposite side of the table Mrs. Oliver was asking Major Despard if he knew of any\nunheard\u2010of out\u2010of\u2010the\u2010way poisons.",
    "\u201cWell there\u2019s curare.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear man vieux jeu That\u2019s been done hundreds of times.",
    "I mean something new\u201d\nMajor Despard said dryly \u201cPrimitive tribes are rather old fashioned.",
    "They stick to the good\nold stuff their grandfathers and great\u2010grandfathers used before them.\u201d\n11\n\n\f\u201cVery tiresome of them\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cI should have thought they were always\nexperimenting with pounding up herbs and things.",
    "Such a chance for explorers I always\nthink.",
    "They could come home and kill off all their rich old uncles with some new drug that\nno one\u2019s ever heard of.\u201d\n\u201cYou should go to civilization not to the wilds for that\u201d said Despard.",
    "\u201cIn the modern\nlaboratory for instance.",
    "Cultures of innocent looking germs that will produce bona fide\ndiseases.\u201d\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t do for my public\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cBesides one is so apt to get the names\nwrong \u2010 staphylococcus and streptococcus and all those things \u2010 so difficult for my\nsecretary and anyway rather dull don\u2019t you think so What do you think Superintendent\nBattle\u201d\n\u201cIn real life people don\u2019t bother about being too subtle Mrs. Oliver\u201d said the\nsuperintendent.",
    "\u201cThey usually stick to arsenic because it\u2019s nice and handy to get hold of.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s simply because there are lots of crimes you people\nat Scotland Yard never find out.",
    "Now if you had a woman there \u2010\u201d\n\u201cAs a matter of fact we have \u2010\u201d\n\u201cYes those dreadful policewomen in funny hats who bother people in parks I mean a\nwoman at the head of things.",
    "Women know about crime.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re usually very successful criminals\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cKeep their heads\nwell.",
    "It\u2019s amazing how they\u2019ll brazen things out.\u201d\nMr. Shaitana laughed gently.",
    "\u201cPoison is a woman\u2019s weapon\u201d he said.",

    "I knew of Despard before \u2010 read his travel book and a jolly good yarn it is.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know that he and Mr. Shaitana were acquainted\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Shaitana never mentioned him to me.",
    "As I say I\u2019d heard of him but never met him.",
    "Miss Meredith I\u2019ve never seen before.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer I know slightly.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you know about her\u201d\nRoberts shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s a widow.",
    "Moderately well off.",
    "Intelligent well\u2010bred woman \u2010 first class bridge\nplayer.",
    "That\u2019s where I\u2019ve met her as a matter of fact playing bridge.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Mr. Shaitana never mentioned her either\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n25\n\n\f\u201cH\u2019m \u2010 that doesn\u2019t help us much.",
    "Now Doctor Roberts perhaps you\u2019ll be so kind as to tax\nyour memory carefully and tell me how often you yourself left your seat at the bridge\ntable and all you can remember about the movements of the others.\u201d\nDoctor Roberts took a few minutes to think.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult\u201d he said frankly \u201cI can remember my own movements more or less.",
    "I got up\nthree times \u2010 that is on three occasions when I was dummy I left my seat and made\nmyself useful.",
    "Once I went over and put wood on the fire.",
    "Once I brought drinks to the two\nladies.",
    "Once I poured out a whisky and soda for myself.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember the times\u201d\n\u201cI could only say very roughly.",
    "We began to play about nine\u2010thirty I imagine.",
    "I should say it\nwas about an hour later that I stoked the fire quite a short time after that I fetched the\ndrinks next hand but one I think and perhaps half\u2010past eleven when I got myself a whisky\nand soda but those times are quite approximate.",
    "I couldn\u2019t answer for their being\ncorrect.\u201d\n\u201cThe table with the drinks was beyond Mr. Shaitana\u2019s chair\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "That\u2019s to say I passed quite near him three times.\u201d\n\u201cAnd each time to the best of your belief he was asleep\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought the first time.",
    "The second time I didn\u2019t even look at him.",
    "Third time\nI rather fancy the thought just passed through my mind \u2018How the beggar does sleep\u2019 but I\ndidn\u2019t really look at him.\u201d\n\u201cVery good.",
    "Now when did your fellow players leave then seats\u201d\nDoctor Roberts frowned.",
    "\u201cDifficult \u2010 very difficult.",
    "Despard went and fetched an extra ash tray I think.",
    "And he went\nfor a drink.",
    "That was before me for I remember he asked me if I\u2019d have one and I said I\nwasn\u2019t quite ready.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the ladies\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer went over to the fire once.",
    "Poked it I think.",
    "I rather fancy she spoke to\nShaitana but I don\u2019t know.",
    "I was playing a rather tricky no trump at the time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Miss Meredith\u201d\n\u201cShe certainly left the table once.",
    "Came round and looked at my hand \u2010 I was her partner\nat the time.",
    "Then she looked at the other people\u2019s hands and then she wandered round\nthe room.",
    "I don\u2019t know what she was doing exactly.",
    "I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d\n26\n\n\fSuperintendent Battle said thoughtfully \u201cAs you were sitting at the bridge table no one\u2019s\nchair was directly facing the fireplace\u201d\n\u201cNo sort of sideways on and there was a big cabinet between \u2010 Chinese piece very\nhandsome.",
    "I can see of course that it would be perfectly possible to stab the old boy.",
    "After all when you\u2019re playing bridge you\u2019re playing bridge.",
    "You\u2019re not looking round you\nand noticing what is going on.",
    "The only person who\u2019s likely to be doing that is dummy.",
    "And\nin this case \u2010\u201d\n\u201cIn this case undoubtedly dummy was the murderer\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cAll the same\u201d said Doctor Roberts \u201cit wanted nerve you know After all who is to say\nthat somebody won\u2019t look up just at the critical moment\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cIt was a big risk.",
    "The motive must have been a strong one.",
    "I wish we\nknew what it was\u201d he added with unblushing mendacity.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll find out I expect\u201d said Roberts.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll go through his papers and all that sort of\nthing.",
    "There will probably be a clue.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hope so\u201d said Superintendent Battle gloomily.",
    "He shot a keen glance at the other.",
    "\u201cI wonder if you\u2019d oblige me Doctor Roberts by giving me a personal opinion \u2010 as man to\nman.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\u201cWhich do you fancy yourself of the three\u201d\nDoctor Roberts shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s easy.",
    "Offhand I\u2019d say Despard.",
    "The man\u2019s got plenty of nerve he\u2019s used to a\ndangerous life where you\u2019ve got to act quickly.",
    "He wouldn\u2019t mind taking a risk.",
    "It doesn\u2019t\nseem to me likely the women are in on this.",
    "Take a bit of strength I should imagine.\u201d\n\u201cNot so much as you might think.",
    "Take a look at this.\u201d\nRather like a conjuror Battle suddenly produced a long thin instrument of gleaming metal\nwith a small round jewelled head.",
    "Doctor Roberts leaned forward took it and examined it with rich professional\nappreciation.",
    "He tried the point and whistled.",
    "\u201cWhat a tool What a tool Absolutely made\nfor murder this little toy.",
    "Go in like butter \u2010 absolutely like butter.",
    "Brought it with him I\nsuppose.\u201d\nBattle shook his head.",
    "27\n\n\f\u201cNo.",
    "It was Mr. Shaitana\u2019s.",
    "It lay on the table near the door with a good many other knick\u2010\nknacks.\u201d\n\u201cSo the murderer helped himself.",
    "A bit of luck finding a tool like that.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s one way of looking at it\u201d said Battle slowly.",
    "\u201cWell of course it wasn\u2019t luck for Shaitana poor fellow.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that Doctor Roberts.",
    "I meant that there was another angle of looking at the\nbusiness.",
    "It occurs to me that it was noticing this weapon that put the idea of murder into\nour criminal\u2019s mind.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it was a sudden inspiration That the murder wasn\u2019t premeditated He\nconceived the idea after he got here Er \u2010 anything to suggest that idea to you\u201d He\nglanced at Battle searchingly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s just an idea\u201d said Superintendent Battle stolidly.",
    "\u201cWell it might be so of course\u201d said Doctor Roberts slowly.",
    "Superintendent Battle cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cWell I won\u2019t keep you any longer Doctor.",
    "Thank you for your help.",
    "Perhaps you\u2019ll leave\nyour address.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "Two hundred Gloucester Terrace W. two.",
    "Telephone Bayswater No.",
    "two\u2010three\u2010\neight\u2010nine\u2010six.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.",
    "I may have to call upon you shortly.\u201d\n\u201cDelighted to see you any time.",
    "Hope there won\u2019t be too much in the papers.",
    "I don\u2019t want\nmy nervous patients upset.\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle looked round at Poirot.",
    "\u201cExcuse me Monsieur Poirot.",
    "If you\u2019d like to ask any questions I\u2019m sure the doctor\nwouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not.",
    "Of course not.",
    "Great admirer of yours Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Little gray cells \u2010\norder and method.",
    "I know all about it.",
    "I feel sure you\u2019ll think of something most intriguing\nto ask me.\u201d\nHercule Poirot spread out his hands in his most foreign manner.",
    "\u201cNo no.",
    "I just like to get all the details clear in my mind.",
    "For instance how many rubbers\ndid you play\u201d\n28\n\n\f\u201cThree\u201d said Roberts promptly.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019d got well into the fourth rubber when you came in.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who played with who\u201d\n\u201cFirst rubber Despard and I against the ladies.",
    "They beat us God bless \u2018em.",
    "Walkover we\nnever held a card.",
    "\u201cSecond rubber Miss Meredith and I against Despard and Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "Third rubber Mrs.\nLorrimer and I against Miss Meredith and Despard.",
    "We cut each time but it worked out\nlike a pivot.",
    "Fourth rubber Miss Meredith and I again.\u201d\n\u201cWho won and who lost\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer won every rubber.",
    "Miss Meredith won the first and lost the next two.",
    "I was\na bit up and Miss Meredith and Despard must have been down.\u201d\nPoirot said smiling \u201cThe good superintendent has asked you your opinion of your\ncompanions as candidates for murder.",
    "I now ask you for your opinion of them as bridge\nplayers.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer\u2019s first class\u201d Doctor Roberts replied promptly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll bet she makes a good\nincome a year out of bridge.",
    "Despard\u2019s a good player too \u2010 what I call a sound player \u2010\nlongheaded chap Miss Meredith you might describe as quite a safe player.",
    "She doesn\u2019t\nmake mistakes but she isn\u2019t brilliant.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you yourself Doctor\u201d\nRoberts\u2019s eyes twinkled \u201cI overbid my hand a bit or so they say.",
    "But I\u2019ve always found it\npays.\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "Doctor Roberts rose.",
    "\u201cAnything more\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cWell good night then.",
    "Good night Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You ought to get some copy out of this.",
    "Better than your untraceable poisons eh\u201d\nDoctor Roberts left the room his bearing springy once more.",
    "Mrs. Oliver said bitterly as the door closed behind him \u201cCopy Copy indeed People are so\nunintelligent.",
    "I could invent a better murder any day than anything real.",
    "I\u2019m never at a loss\nfor a plot.",
    "And the people who read my books like untraceable poisons\u201d\n\n29\n\n\f30\n\n\fChapter 5\nSecond Murderer\nMrs. Lorrimer came into the dining\u2010room like a gentlewoman.",
    "She looked a little pale but\ncomposed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have to bother you\u201d Superintendent Battle began.",
    "\u201cYou must do your duty of course\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer quietly.",
    "\u201cIt is I agree an\nunpleasant position in which to be placed but there is no good shirking it.",
    "I quite realize\nthat one of the four people in that room must be guilty.",
    "Naturally I can\u2019t expect you to\ntake my word that I am not the person.\u201d\nShe accepted the chair that Colonel Race offered her and sat down opposite the\nsuperintendent.",
    "Her intelligent gray eyes met his.",
    "She waited attentively.",
    "\u201cYou knew Mr. Shaitana well\u201d began the superintendent.",
    "\u201cNot very well.",
    "I have known him over a period of some years but never intimately.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you meet him\u201d\n\u201cAt a hotel in Egypt \u2010 the Winter Palace at Luxor I think.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you think of him\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer shrugged her shoulders slightly.",
    "\u201cI thought him \u2010 I may as well say so \u2010 rather a charlatan.\u201d\n\u201cYou had \u2010 excuse me for asking \u2010 no motive for wishing him out of the way\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer looked slightly amused.",
    "\u201cReally Superintendent Battle do you think I should admit it if I had\u201d\n\u201cYou might\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cA really intelligent person might know that a thing was bound to\ncome out.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer inclined her head thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThere is that of course.",
    "No Superintendent Battle I had no motive for wishing Mr.\nShaitana out of the way.",
    "It is really a matter of indifference to me whether he is alive or\ndead.",
    "I thought him a poser and rather theatrical and sometimes he irritated me.",
    "That is \u2010\nor rather was \u2010 my attitude toward him.\u201d\n\n31\n\n\f\u201cThat is that then.",
    "Now Mrs. Lorrimer can you tell me anything about your three\ncompanions\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.",
    "Major Despard and Miss Meredith I met for the first time tonight.",
    "Both of\nthem seem charming people.",
    "Doctor Roberts I know slightly.",
    "He\u2019s a very popular doctor I\nbelieve.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not your own doctor\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d\n\u201cNow Mrs. Lorrimer can you tell me how often you got up from your seat tonight and\nwill you also describe the movements of the other three\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer did not take any time to think.",
    "\u201cI thought you would probably ask me that.",
    "I have been trying to think it out.",
    "I got up once\nmyself when I was dummy.",
    "I went over to the fire.",
    "Mr. Shaitana was alive then.",
    "I\nmentioned to him how nice it was to see a wood fire.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he answered\u201d\n\u201cThat he hated radiators.\u201d\n\u201cDid anyone overhear your conversation\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.",
    "I lowered my voice not to interrupt the players.\u201d She added dryly \u201cIn fact\nyou have only my word for it that Mr. Shaitana was alive and spoke to me.\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle made no protest.",
    "He went on with his quiet methodical\nquestioning.",
    "\u201cWhat time was that\u201d\n\u201cI should think we had been playing a little over an hour.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the others\u201d\n\u201cDoctor Roberts got me a drink.",
    "He also got himself one \u2010 that was later.",
    "Major Despard\nalso went to get a drink \u2010 at about eleven\u2010fifteen I should say.\u201d\n\u201cOnly once\u201d\n\u201cNo \u2010 twice I think.",
    "The men moved about a fair amount but I didn\u2019t notice what they did.",
    "Miss Meredith left her seat once only I think.",
    "She went round to look at her partner\u2019s\nhand.\u201d\n\u201cBut she remained near the bridge table\u201d\n32\n\n\f\u201cI couldn\u2019t say at all.",
    "She may have moved away.\u201d\nBattle nodded.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all very vague\u201d he grumbled.",
    "\u201cI am sorry.\u201d\nOnce again Battle did his conjuring trick and produced the long delicate stiletto.",
    "\u201cWill you look at this Mrs. Lorrimer\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer took it without emotion.",
    "\u201cHave you ever seen that before\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cYet it was lying on a table in the drawing\u2010room.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice it.\u201d\n\u201cYou realize perhaps Mrs. Lorrimer that with a weapon like that a woman could do the\ntrick just as easily as a man.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose she could\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer quietly.",
    "She leaned forward and handed the dainty little thing back to him.",
    "\u201cBut all the same\u201d said Superintendent Battle \u201cthe woman would have to be pretty\ndesperate.",
    "It was a long chance to take.\u201d\nHe waited a minute but Mrs. Lorrimer did not speak.",
    "\u201cDo you know anything of the relations between the other three and Mr. Shaitana\u201d\nShe shook her head.",
    "\u201cNothing at all.\u201d\n\u201cWould you care to give me an opinion as to which of them you consider the most likely\nperson\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer drew herself up stiffly.",
    "\u201cI should not care to do anything of the kind.",
    "I consider that a most improper question.\u201d\nThe superintendent looked like an abashed little boy who has been reprimanded by his\ngrandmother.",
    "33\n\n\f\u201cAddress please\u201d he mumbled drawing his notebook toward him.",
    "\u201cOne eleven Cheyne Lane Chelsea.\u201d\n\u201cTelephone number\u201d\n\u201cChelsea four\u2010five\u2010six\u2010three\u2010two.\u201d Mrs. Lorrimer rose.",
    "\u201cAnything you want to ask Monsieur Poirot\u201d said Battle hurriedly.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer paused her head slightly inclined.",
    "\u201cWould it be a proper question Madame to ask you your opinion of your companions not\nas potential murderers but as bridge players\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer answered coldly \u201cI have no objection to answering that \u2010 if it bears upon\nthe matter at issue in any way though I fail to see how it can.\u201d\n\u201cI will be the judge of that.",
    "Your answer if you please Madame.\u201d\nIn the tone of an impatient adult humouring an idiot child Mrs. Lorrimer replied \u201cMajor\nDespard is a good sound player.",
    "Doctor Roberts overbids but plays his hand brilliantly.",
    "Miss Meredith is quite a nice little player but a bit too cautious.",
    "Anything more\u201d\nIn his turn doing a conjuring trick Poirot produced four crumpled bridge scores.",
    "\u201cThese scores Madame is one of these yours\u201d\nShe examined them.",
    "\u201cThis is my writing.",
    "It is the score of the third rubber.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this score\u201d\n\u201cThat must be Major Despard\u2019s.",
    "He cancels as he goes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this one\u201d\n\u201cMiss Meredith\u2019s.",
    "The first rubber.\u201d\n\u201cSo this unfinished one is Doctor Roberts\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "\u201c\n\u201cThank you Madame.",
    "I think that is all.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer turned to Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cGood night Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Good night Colonel Race.\u201d\nThen having shaken hands with all four of them she went out.",
    "34\n\n\fChapter 6\nThird Murderer\n\u201cDidn\u2019t get any extra change out of her\u201d commented Battle.",
    "\u201cPut me in my place too.",
    "She\u2019s the old\u2010fashioned kind full of consideration for others but arrogant as the devil I\ncan\u2019t believe she did it but you never know She\u2019s got plenty of resolution.",
    "What\u2019s the\nidea of the bridge scores Monsieur Poirot\u201d\nPoirot spread them out on the table.",
    "\u201cThey are illuminating do you not think What do we want in this case A clue to\ncharacter.",
    "And a clue not to one character but to four characters.",
    "And this is where we\nare most likely to find it \u2010 in these scribbled figures.",
    "Here is the first rubber you see \u2010 a\ntame business soon over.",
    "Small neat figures \u2010 careful addition and subtraction \u2010 that is\nMiss Meredith\u2019s score.",
    "She was playing with Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "They had the cards and they\nwon.\u201d\n\u201cIn this next one it is not so easy to follow the play since it is kept in the cancellation style.",
    "But it tells us perhaps something about Major Despard \u2010 a man who likes the whole time\nto know at a glance where he stands.",
    "The figures are small and full of character.\u201d\n\u201cThis next score is Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s \u2010 she and Doctor Roberts against the other two \u2010 a\nHomeric combat figures mounting up above the line each side.",
    "Overbidding on the\ndoctor\u2019s part and they go down \u2010 but since they are both first\u2010class players they never go\ndown very much.",
    "If the doctor\u2019s overbidding induces rash bidding on the other side there\nis the chance seized of doubling.",
    "See \u2010 these figures here are doubled tricks gone down.",
    "A\ncharacteristic handwriting graceful very legible firm.\u201d\n\u201cHere is the last score \u2010 the unfinished rubber.",
    "I collected one score in each person\u2019s\nhandwriting you see.",
    "Figures rather flamboyant.",
    "Not such high scores as the preceding\nrubber.",
    "That is probably because the doctor was playing with Miss Meredith and she is a\ntimid player.",
    "His calling would make her more so\u201d\n\u201cYou think perhaps that they are foolish these questions that I ask But it is not so.",
    "I\nwant to get at the characters of these four players and when it is only about bridge I ask\neveryone is ready and willing to speak.\u201d\n\u201cI never think your questions foolish Monsieur Poirot\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve seen too much of\nyour work.",
    "Everyone\u2019s got his own ways of working.",
    "I know that.",
    "I give my inspectors a\nfree hand always.",
    "Everyone\u2019s got to find out for himself what method suits him best.",
    "But\nwe\u2019d better not discuss that now.",
    "We\u2019ll have the girl in.\u201d\nAnne Meredith was upset.",
    "She stopped in the doorway.",
    "Her breath came unevenly.",
    "Superintendent Battle was immediately fatherly.",
    "He rose set a chair for her at a slightly\ndifferent angle.",
    "35\n\n\f\u201cSit down Miss Meredith sit down.",
    "Now don\u2019t be alarmed.",

    "\u201cTravelled a lot too.",
    "Not many parts of the world he doesn\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\n47\n\n\f\u201cSecret Service I suppose\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me so I know but he wouldn\u2019t\nhave been asked otherwise this evening.",
    "The four murderers and the four sleuths \u2010\nScotland Yard.",
    "Secret Service.",
    "Private.",
    "Fiction.",
    "A clever idea.\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cYou are in error Madame.",
    "It was a very stupid idea.",
    "The tiger was alarmed \u2010 and the tiger\nsprang.\u201d\n\u201cThe tiger Why the tiger\u201d\n\u201cBy the tiger I mean the murderer\u201d said Poirot.",
    "Battle said bluntly \u201cWhat\u2019s your idea of the right line to take Monsieur Poirot That\u2019s one\nquestion.",
    "And I\u2019d also like to know what you think of the psychology of these four people.",
    "You\u2019re rather hot on that.\u201d\nStill smoothing his bridge scores Poirot said \u201cYou are right psychology is very important.",
    "We know the kind of murder that has been committed the way it was committed.",
    "If we\nhave a person who from the psychological point of view could not have committed that\nparticular type of murder then we can dismiss that person from our calculations.",
    "We\nknow something about these people.",
    "We have our own impression of them we know the\nline that each has elected to take and we know something about their minds and their\ncharacters from what we have learned about them as card players and from the study of\ntheir handwriting and of these scores.",
    "But alas It is not too easy to give a definite\npronouncement.",
    "This murder required audacity and nerve \u2010 a person who was willing to\ntake a risk.\u201d\n\u201cWell we have Doctor Roberts \u2010 a bluffer an over\u2010bidder of his hand a man with\ncomplete confidence in his own powers to pull off a risky thing.",
    "His psychology fits very\nwell with the crime.",
    "One might say then that that automatically wipes out Miss Meredith.",
    "She is timid frightened of overbidding her hand careful economical prudent and lacking\nin self\u2010confidence \u2010 the last type of person to carry out a bold and risky coup.",
    "But a timid\nperson will murder out of fear.",
    "A frightened nervous person can be made desperate can\nturn like a rat at bay if driven into a corner.",
    "If Miss Meredith had committed a crime in the\npast and if she believed that Mr. Shaitana knew the circumstances of that crime and was\nabout to deliver her up to justice she would be wild with terror she would stop at nothing\nto save herself.",
    "It would be the same result though brought about through a different\nreaction \u2010 not cool nerve and daring but desperate panic.\u201d\n\u201cThen take Major Despard \u2010 a cool resourceful man willing to try a long shot if he believed\nit absolutely necessary.",
    "He would weigh the pros and cons and might decide that there\nwas a sporting chance in his favour \u2010 and he is the type of man to prefer action to inaction\nand a man who would never shrink from taking the dangerous way if he believed there\nwas a reasonable chance of success.",
    "Finally there is Mrs. Lorrimer an elderly woman but\na woman in full possession of her wits and faculties.",
    "A cool woman.",
    "A woman with a\nmathematical brain.",
    "She has probably the best brain of the four.",
    "I confess that if Mrs.\nLorrimer committed a crime I should expect it to be a premeditated crime.",
    "I can see her\n48\n\n\fplanning a crime slowly and carefully making sure that there were no flaws in her scheme.",
    "For that reason she seems to me slightly more unlikely than the other three.",
    "She is\nhowever the most dominating personality and whatever she undertook she would\nprobably carry through without a flaw.",
    "She is a thoroughly efficient woman.\u201d He paused.",
    "\u201cSo you see that does not help us much.",
    "No \u2010 there is only one way in this crime.",
    "We\nmust go back into the past.\u201d\nBattle sighed.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve said it\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cIn the opinion of Mr. Shaitana each of those four people had committed murder.",
    "Had he\nevidence Or was it a guess We cannot tell.",
    "It is unlikely I think that he could have had\nactual evidence in all four cases \u2010\u201d\n\u201cI agree with you there\u201d said Battle nodding his head.",
    "\u201cThat would be a bit too much of a\ncoincidence.\u201d\n\u201cI suggest that it might come about this way \u2010 murder or a certain form of murder is\nmentioned and Mr. Shaitana surprised a look on someone\u2019s face.",
    "He was very quick \u2010 very\nsensitive to expression.",
    "It amuses him to experiment to probe gently in the course of\napparently aimless conversation he is alert to notice a wince a reservation a desire to\nturn the conversation.",
    "Oh it is easily done.",
    "If you suspect a certain secret nothing is easier\nthan to confirm your suspicion.",
    "Every time a word goes home you notice it \u2010 if you are\nwatching for such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the sort of game that would have amused our late friend\u201d said Battle nodding.",
    "\u201cWe may assume then that such was the procedure in one or more cases.",
    "He may have\ncome across a piece of actual evidence in another case and followed it up.",
    "I doubt\nwhether in any of the cases he had sufficient actual knowledge with which \u2010 for instance \u2010\nto have gone to the police.\u201d\n\u201cOr it mayn\u2019t have been the kind of case\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cOften enough there\u2019s a fishy\nbusiness \u2010 we suspect foul play but we can\u2019t ever prove it.",
    "Anyway the course is clear.",
    "We\u2019ve got to go through the records of all these people \u2010 and note any deaths that may be\nsignificant.",
    "I expect you noticed just as the colonel did what Shaitana said at dinner.\u201d\n\u201cThe black angel\u201d murmured Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cA neat little reference to poison to accident to a doctor\u2019s opportunities to shooting\naccidents.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t be surprised if he signed his death warrant when he said those\nwords.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a nasty sort of pause\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThose words went home to one person at least \u2010 that person probably\nthought that Shaitana knew far more than he really did.",
    "That listener thought that they\nwere the prelude to the end \u2010 that the party was a dramatic entertainment arranged by\n49\n\n\fShaitana leading up to arrest for murder as its climax Yes as you say he signed his death\nwarrant when he baited his guests with those words.\u201d\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence.",
    "\u201cThis will be a long business\u201d said Battle with a sigh.",
    "\u201cWe can\u2019t find out all we want in a\nmoment \u2010 and we\u2019ve got to be careful.",
    "We don\u2019t want any of the four to suspect what\nwe\u2019re doing.",
    "All our questioning and so on must seem to have to do with this murder.",
    "There mustn\u2019t be a suspicion that we\u2019ve got any idea of the motive for the crime.",
    "And the\ndevil of it is we\u2019ve got to check up on four possible murders in the past not one.\u201d\nPoirot demurred.",
    "\u201cOur friend Mr. Shaitana was not infallible\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHe may \u2010 it is just possible \u2010 have\nmade a mistake.\u201d\n\u201cAbout all four\u201d\n\u201cNo \u2010 he was more intelligent than that.\u201d\n\u201cCall it fifty\u2010fifty\u201d\n\u201cNot even that.",
    "For me I say one in four.\u201d\n\u201cOne innocent and three guilty That\u2019s bad enough.",
    "And the devil of it is even if we get at\nthe truth it mayn\u2019t help us.",
    "Even if somebody did push his or her great\u2010aunt down the\nstairs years ago it won\u2019t be much use to us today.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes it will be of use to us.\u201d Poirot encouraged him.",
    "\u201cYou know that.",
    "You know it as\nwell as I do.\u201d\nBattle nodded slowly.",
    "\u201cI know what you mean\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSame hallmark.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean\u201d said Mrs. Oliver \u201cthat the previous victim will have been stabbed with a\ndagger too\u201d\n\u201cNot quite as crude as that Mrs. Oliver\u201d said Battle turning to her.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t doubt it\nwill be essentially the same type of crime.",
    "The details may be different but the essentials\nunderlying them will be the same.",
    "It\u2019s odd but a criminal gives himself away every time by\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cMan is an unoriginal animal\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cWomen\u201d said Mrs. Oliver \u201care capable of infinite variation.",
    "I should never commit the\nsame type of murder twice running.\u201d\n50\n\n\f\u201cDon\u2019t you ever write the same plot twice running\u201d asked Battle.",
    "\u201cThe Lotus Murder\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe Clue of the Candle Wax.\u201d\nMrs. Oliver turned on him her eyes beaming appreciation.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s clever of you \u2010 that\u2019s\nreally very clever of you.",
    "Because of course those two are exactly the same plot but\nnobody else has seen it.",
    "One is stolen papers at an informal week\u2010end party of the\nCabinet and the other\u2019s a murder in Borneo in a rubber planter\u2019s bungalow.\u201d\n\u201cBut the essential point on which the story turns is the same\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cOne of your\nneatest tricks.",
    "The rubber planter arranges his own murder the cabinet minister arranges\nthe robbery of his own papers.",
    "At the last minute the third person steps in and turns\ndeception into reality.\u201d\n\u201cI enjoyed your last Mrs. Oliver\u201d said Superintendent Battle kindly.",
    "\u201cThe one where all\nthe chief constables were shot simultaneously.",
    "You just slipped up once or twice on\nofficial details.",
    "I know you\u2019re keen on accuracy so I wondered if \u2010\u201d\nMrs. Oliver interrupted him.",
    "\u201cAs a matter of fact I don\u2019t care two pins about accuracy.",
    "Who is accurate Nobody\nnowadays.",
    "If a reporter writes that a beautiful girl of twenty\u2010two dies by turning on the\ngas after looking out over the sea and kissing her favourite Labrador Bob good\u2010by does\nanybody make a fuss because the girl was twenty\u2010six the room faced inland and the dog\nwas a Sealyham terrier called Bonnie If a journalist can do that sort of thing I don\u2019t see\nthat it matters if I mix up police ranks and say a revolver when I mean an automatic and a\ndictograph when I mean a phonograph and use a poison that just allows you to gasp one\ndying sentence and no more.\u201d\n\u201cWhat really matters is plenty of bodies If the thing\u2019s getting a little dull some more\nblood cheers it up.",
    "Somebody is going to tell something \u2010 and then they\u2019re killed first That\nalways goes down well.",
    "It comes in all my books \u2010 camouflaged different ways of course.",
    "And people like untraceable poisons and idiotic police inspectors and girls tied up in\ncellars with sewer gas or water pouring in such a troublesome way of killing anyone really\nand a hero who can dispose of anything from three to seven villains single\u2010handed.",
    "I\u2019ve\nwritten thirty\u2010two books by now \u2010 and of course they\u2019re all exactly the same really as\nMonsieur Poirot seems to have noticed \u2010 but nobody else has and I only regret one thing\nmaking my detective a Finn.",
    "I don\u2019t really know anything about Finns and I\u2019m always\ngetting letters from Finland pointing out something impossible that he\u2019s said or done.",
    "They seem to read detective stories a good deal in Finland.",
    "I suppose it\u2019s the long winters\nwith no daylight.",
    "In Bulgaria and Rumania they don\u2019t seem to read at all.",
    "I\u2019d have done\nbetter to have made him a Bulgarian\u201d She broke off.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.",
    "I\u2019m talking shop.",
    "And this is a real murder.\u201d Her face lighted up.",
    "\u201cWhat a\ngood idea it would be if none of them had murdered him.",
    "If he\u2019d asked them all and then\nquietly committed suicide just for the fun of making a schemozzle.\u201d\n\n51\n\n\fPoirot nodded approvingly.",
    "\u201cAn admirable solution.",
    "So neat.",
    "So ironic.",
    "But alas Mr.\nShaitana was not that sort of man.",
    "He was very fond of life.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he was really a nice man\u201d said Mrs. Oliver slowly.",
    "\u201cHe was not nice no\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut he was alive \u2010 and now he is dead and as I told\nhim once I have a bourgeois attitude to murder.",
    "I disapprove of it.\u201d\nHe added softly \u201cAnd so \u2010 I am prepared to go inside the tiger\u2019s cage.\u201d\n\n52\n\n\fChapter 9\nDoctor Roberts\n\u201cGood morning Superintendent Battle.\u201d\nDoctor Roberts rose from his chair and offered a large pink hand smelling of soap and\ncarbolic.",
    "\u201cHow are things going\u201d he went on.",
    "Superintendent Battle glanced round the comfortable consulting room before answering.",
    "\u201cWell Doctor Roberts strictly speaking they\u2019re not going.",
    "They\u2019re standing still.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s been nothing much in the papers I\u2019ve been glad to see.\u201d\n\u201cSudden death of the well\u2010known Mr. Shaitana at an evening party in his own house.",
    "It\u2019s\nleft at that for the moment.",
    "We\u2019ve had the autopsy \u2010 I brought a report of the findings\nalong \u2010 thought it might interest you \u2010\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you it would.",
    "H\u2019m \u2010 cervical third rib et cetera.",
    "Yes very interesting.\u201d\nHe handed it back.",
    "\u201cAnd we\u2019ve interviewed Mr. Shaitana\u2019s solicitor.",
    "We know the terms of his will.",
    "Nothing of\ninterest there.",
    "He has relatives in Syria it seems.",
    "And then of course we\u2019ve been through\nall his private papers.\u201d\nWas it fancy or did that broad clean \u2010 shaven countenance look a little strained \u2010 a little\nwooden\n\u201cAnd\u201d asked Doctor Roberts.",
    "\u201cNothing\u201d said Superintendent Battle watching him.",
    "There wasn\u2019t a sigh of relief.",
    "Nothing so blatant as that.",
    "But the doctor\u2019s figure seemed to\nrelax just a shade more comfortably in his chair.",
    "\u201cAnd so you\u2019ve come to me\u201d\n\u201cAnd so as you say I\u2019ve come to you.\u201d\nThe doctor\u2019s eyebrows rose a little and his shrewd eyes looked into Battle\u2019s.",
    "\u201cWant to go through my private papers \u2010 eh\u201d\n\n53\n\n\f\u201cThat was my idea.\u201d\n\u201cGot a search warrant\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWell you could get one easily enough I suppose.",
    "I\u2019m not going to make difficulties.",
    "It\u2019s\nnot very pleasant being suspected of murder but I suppose I can\u2019t blame you for what\u2019s\nobviously your duty.\u201d\n\u201cThank you sir\u201d said Superintendent Battle with real gratitude.",
    "\u201cI appreciate your\nattitude if I may say so very much.",
    "I hope all the others will be as reasonable I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can\u2019t be cured must be endured\u201d said the doctor good\u2010humouredly.",
    "He went on.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve finished seeing my patients here.",
    "I\u2019m just off on my rounds.",
    "I\u2019ll leave you\nmy keys and just say a word to my secretary and you can rootle to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very nice and pleasant I\u2019m sure\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you a few more\nquestions before you go.\u201d\n\u201cAbout the other night Really I told you all I know\u201d\n\u201cNo not about the other night.",
    "About yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWell man ask away.",
    "What do you want to know\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d just like a rough sketch of your career Doctor Roberts.",
    "Birth marriage and so on.\u201d\n\u201cIt will get me into practice for Who\u2019s Who\u201d said the doctor dryly.",
    "\u201cMy career\u2019s a perfectly\nstraightforward one.",
    "I\u2019m a Shropshire man born at Ludlow.",
    "My father was in practice\nthere.",
    "He died when I was fifteen.",
    "I was educated at Shrewsbury and went in for medicine\nlike my father before me.",
    "I\u2019m a Saint Christopher\u2019s man \u2010 but you\u2019ll have all the medical\ndetails already I expect.\u201d\n\u201cI looked you up yes sir.",
    "You an only child or have you any brothers or sisters\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m an only child.",
    "Both my parents are dead and I\u2019m unmarried.",
    "Will that do to get on\nwith I came into partnership here with Doctor Emery.",
    "He retired about fifteen years ago.",
    "Lives in Ireland.",
    "I\u2019ll give you his address if you like.",
    "I live here with a cook a parlour\u2010maid\nand a housemaid.",
    "My secretary comes in daily.",
    "I make a good income and I only kill a\nreasonable number of my patients.",
    "How\u2019s that\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle grinned.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s fairly comprehensive Doctor Roberts.",
    "I\u2019m glad\nyou\u2019ve got a sense of humour.",
    "Now I\u2019m going to ask you one more thing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a strictly moral man Superintendent.\u201d\n54\n\n\f\u201cOh that wasn\u2019t my meaning.",
    "No I was just going to ask you if you\u2019d give me the names of\nfour friends \u2010 people who\u2019ve known you intimately for a number of years.",
    "Kind of\nreferences if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cYes I think so.",
    "Let me see now.",
    "You\u2019d prefer people who are actually in London now\u201d\n\u201cIt would make it a bit easier but it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\nThe doctor thought for a minute or two then with his fountain pen he scribbled four\nnames and addresses on a paper and pushed it across the desk to Battle.",
    "\u201cWill those do They\u2019re the best I can think of on the spur of the moment.\u201d\nBattle read carefully nodded his head in satisfaction and put the sheet of paper away in\nan inner pocket.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of elimination\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThe sooner I can get one person eliminated\nand go on to the next the better it is for everyone concerned.",
    "I\u2019ve got to make perfectly\ncertain that you weren\u2019t on bad terms with the late Mr. Shaitana that you had no private\nconnections or business dealings with him that there was no question of his having\ninjured you at any time and your bearing resentment.",
    "I may believe you when you say you\nonly know him slightly but it isn\u2019t a question of my belief.",
    "I\u2019ve got to say I\u2019ve made sure.\u201d\n\u201cOh I understand perfectly.",
    "You\u2019ve got to think everybody\u2019s a liar till he\u2019s proved he\u2019s\nspeaking the truth.",
    "Here are my keys Superintendent.",
    "That\u2019s the drawers of the desk \u2010\nthat\u2019s the bureau \u2010 that little one\u2019s the key of the poison cupboard.",
    "Be sure you lock it up\nagain.",
    "Perhaps I\u2019d better just have a word with my secretary.\u201d He pressed a button on his\ndesk.",
    "Almost immediately the door opened and a competent\u2010looking young woman appeared.",
    "\u201cYou rang Doctor\u201d\n\u201cThis is Miss Burgess Superintendent Battle from Scotland Yard.\u201d\nMiss Burgess turned a cool gaze on Battle.",
    "It seemed to say \u201cDear me what sort of an\nanimal is this\u201d\n\u201cI should be glad Miss Burgess if you will answer any questions Superintendent Battle\nmay put to you and give him any help he may need.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly if you say so Doctor.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Roberts rising.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll be off.",
    "Did you put the morphia in my case I shall need it\nfor the Lockhaert case \u2010\u201d\nHe bustled out still talking and Miss Burgess followed him.",
    "She returned a minute or two\nlater to say \u201cWill you press that button when you want me Superintendent Battle\u201d\n55\n\n\fSuperintendent Battle thanked her and said he would do so.",
    "Then he set to work.",
    "His search was careful and methodical though he had no great hopes of finding anything\nof importance.",
    "Roberts\u2019s ready acquiescence dispelled the chance of that.",
    "Roberts was no\nfool.",
    "He would realize that a search would be bound to come and he would make\nprovisions accordingly.",
    "There was however a faint chance that Battle might come across\na hint of the information he was really after since Roberts would not know the real object\nof his search.",
    "Superintendent Battle opened and shut drawers rifled pigeonholes glanced\nthrough a checkbook estimated the unpaid bills \u2010 noted what those same bills were for\nscrutinized Roberts\u2019s passbook ran through his case notes and generally left no written\ndocument unturned.",
    "The result was meager in the extreme.",
    "He next took a look through\nthe poison cupboard noted the wholesale firms with which the doctor dealt and the\nsystem of checking re\u2010locked the cupboard and passed on to the bureau.",
    "The contents of\nthe latter were of a more personal nature but Battle found nothing germane to his\nsearch.",
    "He shook his head sat down in the doctor\u2019s chair and pressed the desk button.",
    "Miss Burgess appeared with promptitude.",
    "Superintendent Battle asked her politely to be seated and then sat studying her for a\nmoment before he decided which way to tackle her.",
    "He had sensed immediately her\nhostility and he was uncertain whether to provoke her into unguarded speech by\nincreasing that hostility or whether to try a softer method of approach.",
    "\u201cI suppose you know what all this is about Miss Burgess\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cDoctor Roberts told me\u201d said Miss Burgess shortly.",
    "\u201cThe whole thing\u2019s rather delicate\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cIs it\u201d said Miss Burgess.",
    "\u201cWell it\u2019s rather a nasty business.",
    "Four people are under suspicion and one of them must\nhave done it.",
    "What I want to know is whether you\u2019ve ever seen this Mr. Shaitana\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cEver heard Doctor Roberts speak of him\u201d\n\u201cNever \u2010 No I am wrong.",
    "About a week ago Doctor Roberts told me to enter a dinner\nappointment in his engagement book.",
    "Mr. Shaitana eight\u2010fifteen on the eighteenth.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that is the first you ever heard of this Mr. Shaitana\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cNever seen his name in the papers He was often in the fashionable news.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got better things to do than reading the fashionable news.\u201d\n56\n\n\f\u201cI expect you have.",
    "Oh I expect you have\u201d said the superintendent mildly.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d he went on.",
    "\u201cThere it is.",
    "All four of these people will only admit to knowing Mr.\nShaitana slightly.",
    "But one of them knew him well enough to kill him.",
    "It\u2019s my job to find out\nwhich of them it was.\u201d\nThere was an unhelpful pause.",
    "Miss Burgess seemed quite uninterested in the\nperformance of Superintendent Battle\u2019s job.",
    "It was her job to obey her employer\u2019s orders\nand sit here listening to what Superintendent Battle chose to say and answer any direct\nquestions he might choose to put to her.",
    "\u201cYou know Miss Burgess\u201d the superintendent found it uphill work but he persevered \u201cI\ndoubt if you appreciate half the difficulties of our job.",
    "People say things for instance.",
    "Well we mayn\u2019t believe a word of it but we\u2019ve got to take notice of it all the same.",
    "It\u2019s\nparticularly noticeable in a case of this kind.",
    "I don\u2019t want to say anything against your sex\nbut there\u2019s no doubt that a woman when she\u2019s rattled is apt to lash out with her tongue a\nbit.",
    "She makes unfounded accusations hints this that and the other and rakes up all sorts\nof old scandals that have probably nothing whatever to do with the case.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean\u201d demanded Miss Burgess \u201cthat one of these other people has been saying\nthings against the doctor\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly said anything\u201d said Battle cautiously.",
    "\u201cBut all the same I\u2019m bound to take\nnotice.",
    "Suspicious circumstances about the death of a patient.",
    "Probably all a lot of\nnonsense.",
    "I\u2019m ashamed to bother the doctor with it.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose someone\u2019s got hold of that story about Mrs. Graves\u201d said Miss Burgess\nwrathfully.",
    "\u201cThe way people talk about things they know nothing whatever about is\ndisgraceful.",
    "Lots of old ladies get like that they think everybody is poisoning them \u2010 their\nrelations and their servants and even their doctors.",
    "Mrs. Graves had had three doctors\nbefore she came to Doctor Roberts and then when she got the same fancies about him\nhe was quite willing for her to have Doctor Lee instead.",
    "It\u2019s the only thing to do in these\ncases he said.",
    "And after Doctor Lee she had Doctor Steele and then Doctor Farmer \u2010 until\nshe died poor old thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised the way the smallest thing starts a story\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cWhenever a\ndoctor benefits by the death of a patient somebody has something ill\u2010natured to say.",
    "And\nyet why shouldn\u2019t a grateful patient leave a little something or even a big something to\nher medical attendant\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the relations\u201d said Miss Burgess.",
    "\u201cI always think there\u2019s nothing like death for\nbringing out the meanness of human nature.",
    "Squabbling over who\u2019s to have what before\nthe body\u2019s cold.",
    "Luckily Doctor Roberts has never had any trouble of that kind.",
    "He always\nsays he hopes his patients won\u2019t leave him anything.",
    "I believe he once had a legacy of fifty\npounds and he\u2019s had two walking sticks and a gold watch but nothing else.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult life that of a professional man\u201d said Battle with a sigh.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s always open\nto blackmail.",
    "The most innocent occurrences lend themselves sometimes to a scandalous\n57\n\n\fappearance.",
    "A doctor\u2019s got to avoid even the appearance of evil that means he\u2019s got to\nhave his wits about him good and sharp.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of what you say is true\u201d said Miss Burgess.",
    "\u201cDoctors have a difficult time with\nhysterical women.\u201d\n\u201cHysterical women.",
    "That\u2019s right.",
    "I thought in my own mind that that was all it amounted\nto.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you mean that dreadful Mrs. Craddock\u201d\nBattle pretended to think\n\u201cLet me see was it three years ago No more.\u201d\n\u201cFour or five I think.",
    "She was a most unbalanced woman I was glad when she went\nabroad and so was Doctor Roberts.",
    "She told her husband the most frightful lies they\nalways do of course.",
    "Poor man he wasn\u2019t quite himself he\u2019d begun to be ill.",
    "He died of\nanthrax you know an infected shaving brush.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten that\u201d said Battle untruthfully.",
    "\u201cAnd then she went abroad and died not long afterward.",
    "But I always thought she was a\nnasty type of woman \u2010 man mad you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know the kind\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cVery dangerous they are.",
    "A doctor\u2019s got to give them a\nwide berth.",
    "Whereabouts did she die abroad \u2010 I seem to remember \u2010\u201d\n\u201cEgypt I think it was.",
    "She got blood poisoning \u2010 some native infection.\u201d\n\u201cAnother thing that must be difficult for a doctor\u201d said Battle making a conversational\nleap is when he suspects that one of his patients is being poisoned by one of his or her\nrelatives.",
    "What\u2019s he to do He\u2019s got to be sure \u2010 or else hold his tongue.",
    "And if he\u2019s done\nthe latter then it\u2019s awkward for him if there\u2019s talk of foul play afterward.",
    "I wonder if any\ncase of that kind has ever come Doctor Roberts\u2019s way\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think it has\u201d said Miss Burgess considering.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything\nlike that.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the statistical point of view it would be interesting to know how many deaths occur\namong a doctor\u2019s practice per year.",
    "For instance now you\u2019ve been with Doctor Roberts\nsome years \u2010\u201d\n\u201cSeven.\u201d\n\u201cSeven.",
    "Well how many deaths have there been in that time offhand\u201d\n\n58\n\n\f\u201cReally it\u2019s difficult to say.\u201d Miss Burgess gave herself up to calculation.",
    "She was by now\nquite thawed and unsuspicious.",
    "\u201cSeven eight \u2010 of course I can\u2019t remember exactly \u2010 I\nshouldn\u2019t say more than thirty in the time.\u201d\n\u201cThen I fancy Doctor Roberts must be a better doctor than most\u201d said Battle genially.",
    "\u201cI\nsuppose too most of his patients are upper class.",
    "They can afford to take care of\nthemselves.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very popular doctor.",
    "He\u2019s so good at diagnosis.\u201d\nBattle sighed and rose to his feet.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been wandering from my duty which is\nto find out a connection between the doctor and this Mr. Shaitana.",
    "You\u2019re quite sure he\nwasn\u2019t a patient of the doctor\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\n\u201cUnder another name perhaps\u201d Battle handed her a photograph.",
    "\u201cRecognize him at all\u201d\n\u201cWhat a very theatrical\u2010looking person No I\u2019ve never seen him here at any time.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s that.\u201d Battle sighed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m much obliged to the doctor I\u2019m sure for being so\npleasant about everything.",
    "Tell him so from me will you Tell him I\u2019m passing on to\nnumber two.",
    "Good\u2010bye Miss Burgess and thank you for your help.\u201d\nHe shook hands and departed.",
    "Walking along the street he took a small notebook from his\npocket and made several entries in it under the letter R.\nMrs. Graves Unlikely.",
    "Mrs. Craddock\nNo legacies.",
    "No wife.",
    "Pity.",
    "Investigate deaths of patients.",
    "Difficult.",
    "He closed the book and turned into the Lancaster Gate branch of the London  Wessex\nbank.",
    "The display of his official card brought him to a private interview with the manager.",
    "\u201cGood morning sir.",
    "One of your clients is a Doctor Geoffrey Roberts I understand.\u201d\n\u201cQuite correct Superintendent.\u201d\n\u201cI shall want some information about that gentleman\u2019s account going back over a period\nof years.\u201d\n59\n\n\f\u201cI will see what I can do for you.\u201d\nA complicated half\u2010hour followed.",
    "Finally Battle with a sigh tucked away a sheet of\npencilled figures.",
    "\u201cGot what you want\u201d inquired the bank manager curiously.",
    "\u201cNo I haven\u2019t.",
    "Not one suggestive lead.",
    "Thank you all the same.\u201d\nAt that same moment Doctor Roberts washing his hands in his consulting room said over\nhis shoulder to Miss Burgess \u201cWhat about our stolid sleuth eh Did he turn the place\nupside down and you inside out\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t get much out of me I can tell you\u201d said Miss Burgess setting her lips tightly.",
    "\u201cMy dear girl no need to be an oyster.",
    "I told you to tell him all he wanted to know.",
    "What\ndid he want to know by the way\u201d\n\u201cOh he kept harping on your knowing that man Shaitana \u2010 suggested even that he might\nhave come here as a patient under a different name.",
    "He showed me his photograph.",
    "Such\na theatrical\u2010looking man\u201d\n\u201cShaitana Oh yes fond of posing as a modern Mephistopheles.",
    "It went down rather well\non the whole.",
    "What else did Battle ask you\u201d\n\u201cReally nothing very much.",
    "Except \u2010 oh yes somebody had been telling him some\nabsolute nonsense about Mrs. Graves \u2010 you know the way she used to go on.\u201d\n\u201cGraves Graves Oh yes old Mrs. Graves That\u2019s rather funny\u201d The doctor laughed with\nconsiderable amusement.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s really very funny indeed.\u201d\nAnd in high good humour he went in to lunch.",
    "60\n\n\fChapter 10\nDoctor Roberts Continued\nSuperintendent Battle was lunching with Hercule Poirot.",
    "The former looked downcast the\nlatter sympathetic.",
    "\u201cYour morning then has not been entirely successful\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Battle\nshook his head.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be uphill work Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think of him\u201d\n\u201cOf the doctor Well frankly I think Shaitana was right.",
    "He\u2019s a killer.",
    "Reminds me of\nWestaway.",
    "And of that lawyer chap in Norfolk.",
    "Same hearty self\u2010confident manner.",
    "Same\npopularity.",
    "Both of them were clever devils \u2010 so\u2019s Roberts.",
    "All the same it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat Roberts killed Shaitana and as a matter of fact I don\u2019t think he did.",
    "He\u2019d know the risk\ntoo well \u2010 better than a layman would \u2010 that Shaitana might wake and cry out.",
    "No I don\u2019t\nthink Roberts murdered him.\u201d\n\u201cBut you think he has murdered someone\u201d\n\u201cPossibly quite a lot of people.",
    "Westaway had.",
    "But it\u2019s going to be hard to get at.",
    "I\u2019ve\nlooked over his bank account \u2010 nothing suspicious there \u2010 no large sums suddenly paid in.",
    "At any rate in the last seven years he\u2019s not had any legacy from a patient.",
    "That wipes out\nmurder for direct gain.",
    "He\u2019s never married \u2010 that\u2019s a pity \u2010 so ideally simple for a doctor to\nkill his own wife.",
    "He\u2019s well to do but then he\u2019s got a thriving practice among well\u2010to\u2010do\npeople.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact he appears to lead a thoroughly blameless life \u2010 and perhaps does do so.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.",
    "But I prefer to believe the worst.\u201d\nHe went on.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s the hint of a scandal over a woman \u2010 one of his patients \u2010 name of\nCraddock.",
    "That\u2019s worth looking up I think.",
    "I\u2019ll get someone on to that straightaway.",
    "Woman actually died out in Egypt at some local disease so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything\nin that \u2010 but it might throw a light on his general character and morals.\u201d\n\u201cWas there a husband\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Husband died of anthrax.\u201d\n\u201cAnthrax\u201d\n\u201cYes there were a lot of cheap shaving brushes on the market just then \u2010 some of them\ninfected.",
    "There was a regular scandal about it.\u201d\n61\n\n\f\u201cConvenient\u201d suggested Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.",
    "If her husband were threatening to kick up a row \u2010 But there it\u2019s all\nconjecture.",
    "We haven\u2019t a leg to stand upon.\u201d\n\u201cCourage my friend.",
    "I know your patience.",
    "In the end you will have perhaps as many legs\nas a centipede.\u201d\n\u201cAnd fall into the ditch as a result of thinking about them\u201d grinned Battle.",
    "Then he asked curiously.",
    "\u201cWhat about you Monsieur Poirot Going to take a hand\u201d\n\u201cI too might call on Doctor Roberts.\u201d\n\u201cTwo of us in one day that ought to put the wind up him.\u201d\n\u201cOh I shall be very discreet.",
    "I shall not inquire into his past life.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to know just exactly what line you\u2019ll take\u201d said Battle curiously \u201cbut don\u2019t tell me\nunless you want to.\u201d\n\u201cDu tout \u2010 du tout.",
    "I am most willing.",
    "I shall talk a little of bridge that is all.\u201d\n\u201cBridge again.",
    "You harp on that don\u2019t you Monsieur Poirot\u201d\n\u201cI find the subject very useful.\u201d\n\u201cWell every man to his taste.",
    "I don\u2019t deal much in these fancy approaches.",
    "They don\u2019t suit\nmy style.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your style Superintendent\u201d\nThe superintendent met the twinkle in Poirot\u2019s eyes with an answering twinkle in his own.",
    "\u201cA straightforward honest zealous officer doing his duty in the most laborious manner \u2010\nthat\u2019s my style.",
    "No frills.",
    "No fancy work.",
    "Just honest perspiration.",
    "Stolid and a bit stupid \u2010\nthat\u2019s my ticket.\u201d\nPoirot raised his glass.",
    "\u201cTo our respective methods \u2010 and may success crown our joint\nefforts.\u201d\n\u201cI expect Colonel Race may get us something worth having about Despard\u201d said Battle\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a good many sources of information.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Mrs. Oliver\u201d\n\n62\n\n\f\u201cBit of a tossup there I rather like that woman.",
    "Talks a lot of nonsense but she\u2019s a sport.",
    "And women get to know things about other women that men can\u2019t get at.",
    "She may spot\nsomething useful.\u201d\nThey separated.",
    "Battle went back to Scotland Yard to issue instructions for certain lines to\nbe followed up.",
    "Poirot betook himself to 200 Gloucester Terrace.",
    "Doctor Roberts\u2019s eyebrows rose comically as he greeted his guest.",
    "\u201cTwo sleuths in one\nday\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cHandcuffs by this evening I suppose.\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cI can assure you Doctor Roberts that my attentions are being equally divided between\nall four of you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s something to be thankful for at all events.",
    "Smoke\u201d\n\u201cIf you permit I prefer my own.\u201d\nPoirot lighted one of his tiny Russian cigarettes.",
    "\u201cWell what can I do for you\u201d asked Roberts.",
    "Poirot was silent for a minute or two puffing then he said \u201cAre you a keen observer of\nhuman nature Doctor\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "I suppose I am.",
    "A doctor has to be.\u201d\n\u201cThat was exactly my reasoning I said to myself \u2018A doctor has always to be studying his\npatients \u2010 their expressions their colour how fast they breathe any signs of restlessness\na doctor notices these things automatically almost without noticing he notices Doctor\nRoberts is the man to help me.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m willing enough to help.",
    "What\u2019s the trouble\u201d\nPoirot produced from a neat little pocket case three carefully folded bridge scores.",
    "\u201cThese are the first three rubbers the other evening\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cHere is the first one\nin Miss Meredith\u2019s handwriting.",
    "Now can you tell me with this to refresh your memory\nexactly what the bidding was and how each hand went\u201d\nRoberts stared at him in astonishment.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re joking Monsieur Poirot.",
    "How can I possibly\nremember\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you I should be so very grateful if you could.",
    "Take this first rubber.",
    "The first game\nmust have resulted either in a game bid in hearts or spades or else one or other side must\nhave gone down fifty.\u201d\n63\n\n\f\u201cLet me see \u2010 that was the first hand Yes I think they went out in spades.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the next hand\u201d\n\u201cI suppose one or other of us went down fifty \u2010 but I can\u2019t remember which or what it was\nin.",
    "Really Monsieur Poirot you can hardly expect me to do so.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you remember any of the bidding or the hands\u201d\n\u201cI got a grand slam \u2010 I remember that.",
    "It was doubled too.",
    "And I also remember going\ndown a nasty smack playing three no trumps I think it was \u2010 went down a plenty.",
    "But that\nwas later on.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember with whom you were playing\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer.",
    "She looked a bit grim I remember.",
    "Didn\u2019t like my overbidding I expect.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t remember any other of the hands or the bidding\u201d\nRoberts laughed.",
    "\u201cMy dear Monsieur Poirot did you really expect I could First there was the murder \u2010\nenough to drive the most spectacular hands out of one\u2019s mind \u2010 and in addition I\u2019ve played\nat least half a dozen rubbers since then.\u201d\nPoirot sat looking rather crestfallen.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d said Roberts.",
    "\u201cIt does not matter very much\u201d said Poirot slowly.",
    "\u201cI hoped that you might remember one\nor two at least of the hands because I thought they might be valuable landmarks in\nremembering other things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat other things\u201d\n\u201cWell you might have noticed for instance that your partner made a mess of playing a\nperfectly simple no trumper or that an opponent say presented you with a couple of\nunexpected tricks by failing to lead an obvious card.\u201d\nDoctor Roberts became suddenly serious.",
    "He leaned forward in his chair \u201cAh\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNow I see what you\u2019re driving at.",
    "Forgive me.",
    "I thought at first you were talking pure\nnonsense.",
    "You mean that the murder \u2010 the successful accomplishment of the murder \u2010\nmight have made a definite difference in the guilty party\u2019s play\u201d\nPoirot nodded \u201cYou have seized the idea correctly.",
    "It would be a clue of the first\nexcellence if you had been four players who knew each other\u2019s game well.",
    "A variation a\nsudden lack of brilliance a missed opportunity \u2010 that would have been immediately\nnoticed.",
    "Unluckily you were all strangers to each other.",
    "Variations in play would not be so\n64\n\n\fnoticeable.",
    "But think Monsieur le docteur I beg of you to think.",
    "Do you remember any\ninequalities \u2010 any sudden glaring mistakes \u2010 in the play of anyone\u201d\nThere was silence for a minute or two then Doctor Roberts shook his head.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s no good.",
    "I\ncan\u2019t help you\u201d he said frankly.",
    "\u201cI simply don\u2019t remember.",

    "\u201cYes Miss Meredith\u201d Poirot prompted him.",
    "\u201cShe did make mistakes once or twice I remember \u2010 toward the end of the evening but\nthat may simply have been because she was tired not being a very experienced player.",
    "Her hand shook too \u2010\u201d He stopped.",
    "\u201cWhen did her hand shake\u201d\n\u201cWhen was it now I can\u2019t remember \u2010 I think she was just nervous.",

    "If you show me the door me I march to that\ndoor with complete submission.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer smiled very slightly.",

    "\u201cIt is difficult that\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cMajor Despard scores in the cancellation manner.\u201d\n\u201cI rather fancy both sides went down fifty to start with \u2010 then Doctor Roberts went to five\ndiamonds and we doubled and got him down three tricks.",
    "Then we made three clubs but\nimmediately after the others went game in spades.",
    "We made the second game in five\nclubs.",
    "Then we went down a hundred.",

    "\u201cThis rubber was rather a battle I remember.",
    "It started tamely.",
    "Major Despard and Miss\nMeredith made a one heart bid.",
    "Then we went down a couple of fifties trying for four\nhearts and four spades.",
    "Then the others made game in spades \u2010 no use trying to stop\nthem.",
    "We went down three hands running after that but undoubled.",
    "Then we won the\nsecond game in no trumps.",
    "Then a battle royal started.",
    "Each side went down in turn.",
    "Doctor Roberts overbid but though he got badly down once or twice his calling paid for\nmore than once he frightened Miss Meredith out of bidding her hand.",
    "Then he bid an\noriginal two spades I gave him three diamonds he bid four no trumps I bid five spades\nand he suddenly jumped to seven diamonds.",
    "We were doubled of course.",
    "He had no\nbusiness to make such a bid.",
    "By a kind of miracle we got it.",
    "I never thought we should\nwhen I saw his hand go down.",
    "If the others had led a heart we would have been three\ntricks down.",
    "As it was they led the king of clubs and we got it.",
    "It was really very exciting.\u201d\n\u201cJe crois bien \u2010 a grand slam vulnerable doubled.",
    "It causes the emotions that Me I admit\nit I have not the nerve to go for the slams.",
    "I content myself with the game.\u201d\n\u201cOh but you shouldn\u2019t\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer with energy.",
    "\u201cYou must play the game\nproperly.\u201d\n\u201cTake risks you mean\u201d\n\u201cThere is no risk if the bidding is correct.",
    "It should be a mathematical certainty.",
    "Unfortunately few people really bid well.",
    "They know the opening bids but later they lose\n69\n\n\ftheir heads.",
    "They cannot distinguish between a hand with winning cards in it and a hand\nwithout losing cards \u2010 but I mustn\u2019t give you a lecture on bridge Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cIt would improve my play I am sure Madame.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer resumed her study of the score.",
    "\u201cAfter that excitement the next hands were rather tame.",
    "Have you the fourth score there\nAh yes.",
    "A dingdong battle \u2010 neither side able to score below.\u201d\n\u201cIt is often like that as the evening wears on.\u201d\n\u201cYes one starts tamely and then the cards get worked up.\u201d\nPoirot collected the scores and made a little bow \u201cMadame I congratulate you.",
    "Your card\nmemory is magnificent \u2010 but magnificent You remember one might say every card that\nwas played\u201d\n\u201cI believe I do.\u201d\n\u201cMemory is a wonderful gift.",
    "With it the past is never the past.",
    "I should imagine Madame\nthat to you the past unrolls itself every incident clear as yesterday.",
    "Is that so\u201d\nShe looked at him quickly.",
    "Her eyes were wide and dark.",
    "It was only for a moment then\nshe had resumed her woman\u2010of\u2010the\u2010world manner but Hercule Poirot did not doubt.",

    "I apologize for trespassing on your time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been able to help you more.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have helped me\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cI hardly think so.\u201d She spoke with decision.",
    "\u201cBut yes.",
    "You have told me something I wanted to know.\u201d\nShe asked no question as to what that something was.",
    "He held out his hand.",
    "\u201cThank you Madame for your forbearance.\u201d\nAs she shook hands with him she said \u201cYou are an extraordinary man Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\n70\n\n\f\u201cI am as the good God made me Madame.\u201d\n\u201cWe are all that I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cNot all Madame.",
    "Some of us have tried to improve on his pattern.",
    "Mr. Shaitana for\ninstance.\u201d\n\u201cIn what way do you mean\u201d\n\u201cHe had a very pretty taste in objets de vertus and bric\u2010a\u2010brac he should have been\ncontent with that.",
    "Instead he collected other things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of things\u201d\n\u201cWell \u2010 shall we say \u2010 sensations\u201d\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t you think that was dans son caract\u00e8re\u201d\nPoirot shook his head gravely.",
    "\u201cHe played the part of the devil too successfully.",
    "But he was\nnot the devil.",
    "Au fond he was a stupid man.",
    "And so \u2010 he died.\u201d\n\u201cBecause he was stupid\u201d\n\u201cIt is the sin that is never forgiven and always punished Madame.\u201d\nThere was a silence.",
    "Then Poirot said \u201cI take my departure.",
    "A thousand thanks for your\namiability Madame.",
    "I I will not come again unless you send for me.\u201d\nHer eyebrows rose.",
    "\u201cDear me Monsieur Poirot why should I send for you\u201d\n\u201cYou might.",
    "It is just an idea.",
    "If so I will come.",
    "Remember that.\u201d\nHe bowed once more and left the room.",
    "In the street he said to himself \u201cI am right \u2010 I am sure I am right \u2010 It must be that\u201d\n\n71\n\n\f72\n\n\fChapter 12\nAnne Meredith\nMrs. Oliver extricated herself from the driving seat of her little two\u2010seater with some\ndifficulty.",
    "To begin with the makers of modern motor cars assume that only a pair of\nsylphlike knees will ever be under the steering wheel.",
    "It is also the fashion to sit low.",
    "That\nbeing so for a middle\u2010aged woman of generous proportions it requires a good deal of\nsuperhuman wriggling to get out from under the steering wheel.",
    "In the second place the\nseat next to the driving seat was encumbered by several maps a hand\u2010bag three novels\nand a large bag of apples.",
    "Mrs. Oliver was partial to apples and had indeed been known to\neat as many as five pounds straight off while composing the complicated plot of The Death\nin the Drain Pipe coming to herself with a start and an incipient stomach\u2010ache an hour\nand ten minutes after she was due at an important luncheon party given in her honour.",
    "With a final determined heave and a sharp shove with the knee against a recalcitrant door\nMrs. Oliver arrived a little too suddenly on the sidewalk outside the gate of Wendon\nCottage showering apple cores freely round her as she did so.",
    "She gave a deep sigh pushed back her country hat to an unfashionable angle looked\ndown with approval at the tweeds she had remembered to put on frowned a little when\nshe saw that she had absent\u2010mindedly retained her London high\u2010heeled patent leather\nshoes and pushing open the gate of Wendon Cottage walked up the flagged path to the\nfront door.",
    "She rang the bell and executed a cheerful little rat\u2010a\u2010tat\u2010tat on the knocker \u2010 a\nquaint conceit in the form of a toad\u2019s head.",
    "As nothing happened she repeated the performance.",
    "After a further pause of a minute and a half Mrs. Oliver stepped briskly round the side of\nthe house on a voyage of exploration.",
    "There was a small old\u2010fashioned garden with Michaelmas daisies and straggling\nchrysanthemums behind the cottage and beyond it a field.",
    "Beyond the field was the river.",
    "For an October day the sun was warm.",
    "Two girls were just crossing the field in the direction of the cottage.",

    "The trouble is I\u2019ve no earthly means of knowing which is right.",
    "To begin with perhaps\nShaitana was a moneylender.",
    "He had a very oily look.",
    "Roberts was in his clutches and killed\nhim because he couldn\u2019t get the money to repay the loan.",
    "Or perhaps Shaitana ruined his\ndaughter or his sister.",

    "She said \u201cDo doctors usually want to murder\ntheir patients wholesale Wouldn\u2019t it have rather a regrettable effect on their practice\u201d\n\u201cThere would be a reason of course\u201d said Mrs. Oliver vaguely.",

    "\u201cWe haven\u2019t got a maid \u2010 only a woman who\ncomes in in the mornings.\u201d\nShe introduced him to Rhoda.",
    "Rhoda said briskly\n\u201cLet\u2019s have some tea.",
    "It\u2019s getting chilly.",

    "\u201cI\u2019m going to leave you my card she said.",
    "Here it is with my address on it.",
    "Come and see\nme when you come up to town and we\u2019ll talk everything over and see if we can\u2019t think of\nsomething ingenious to get to the bottom of things.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come out to the gate with you\u201d said Rhoda.",

    "She held out her hand.",
    "\u201cThank you very much\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "It\u2019s very good of you to have bothered.\u201d\n\u201cOf course if you feel that way there\u2019s nothing more to be said\u201d said Mrs. Oliver\ncheerfully.",
    "\u201cI at any rate shall not let the grass grow under my feet.",
    "Good\u2010by my dear.",
    "Look me up in London if you change your mind.\u201d\nShe climbed into the car and started it waving a cheerful hand at the two girls.",

    "She must be to write all those books.",

    "That wasn\u2019t strictly true.",

    "81\n\n\fDespard shot a quick glance at her rather liking the gallant boyish figure that leaned\nagainst the mantelpiece and was following his words so intensely.",
    "They were an attractive\npair these two.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure she couldn\u2019t have a more devoted friend than you Miss Dawes\u201d he said\ncourteously \u201cbut it occurred to me that in the peculiar circumstances the advice of\nsomeone with a good dash of worldly wisdom might not be amiss.",

    "Miss Meredith is under suspicion of having committed murder.",
    "The same applies to\nme and to the two other people who were in the room last night.",

    "Jacobs Peel and Jacobs is the actual name of the firm.",

    "\u201cI should say emphatically so.",
    "There are all sorts of legal pitfalls\u201d\n\u201cAre these people very expensive\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter a bit\u201d said Rhoda.",

    "He added seriously \u201cI\nreally do think it\u2019s a wise course Miss Meredith.\u201d\n\u201cVery well\u201d said Anne slowly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll do it if you think so.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n82\n\n\fRhoda said warmly \u201cI think it\u2019s awfully nice of you Major Despard.",
    "Really frightfully nice.\u201d\nAnne said \u201cThank you.\u201d\nShe hesitated and then said \u201cDid you say Superintendent Battle was coming here\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "You mustn\u2019t be alarmed by that.",
    "It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\n\u201cOh I know.",

    "\u201cAnne and I know you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nHe looked at them both with kindly eyes.",

    "He said quickly \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nBut Rhoda said with a sigh \u201cOf course it was awful but it was exciting too I don\u2019t think\nAnne appreciates that side of it.",

    "88\n\n\f\u201cSorry Miss Meredith.",
    "I\u2019ve had a lot of routine work to do.\u201d\n\u201cSatisfactory\u201d\n\u201cNot particularly.",

    "She explained.",
    "\u201cMy Aunt Emily is just mad on gardening.",
    "Anne spent most of her time\nweeding or putting in bulbs.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you left Mrs. Deering\u201d\n\u201cHer health got worse and she had to have a regular nurse.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s got cancer\u201d said Rhoda.",

    "I asked Anne to come here with me and\nshe\u2019s been here ever since.\u201d\n90\n\n\f\u201cWell that certainly seems a most blameless life\u201d said Battle.",
    "Let\u2019s just get the dates clear.",
    "You were with Mrs. Eldon two years you say.",
    "By the way what is her address now\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s in Palestine.",
    "Her husband has some government appointment out there \u2010 I\u2019m not\nsure what.\u201d\n\u201cAh well I can soon find out.",
    "And after that you went to Mrs. Deering\u201d\n\u201cI was with her three years\u201d said Anne quickly.",
    "\u201cHer address is Marsh Dene Little\nHembury Devon.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cSo you are now twenty\u2010five Miss Meredith.",
    "Now there\u2019s just one\nthing more \u2010 the name and address of a couple of people in Cheltenham who knew you\nand your father.\u201d\nAnne supplied him with these.",
    "\u201cNow about this trip to Switzerland \u2010 where you met Mr. Shaitana.",
    "Did you go alone there\nor was Miss Dawes here with you\u201d\n\u201cWe went out together.",
    "We joined some other people.",
    "There was a party of eight.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about your meeting with Mr. Shaitana.\u201d\nAnne crinkled her brows.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to tell.",

    "He got first prize at the Fancy Dress Ball.",
    "He went\nas Mephistopheles.\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle sighed.",

    "\u201cHe hardly had to make up at all.\u201d\nThe superintendent looked from one girl to the other.",
    "\u201cWhich of you two young ladies knew him best\u201d\nAnne hesitated.",
    "It was Rhoda who answered.",
    "\u201cBoth the same to begin with.",
    "Awfully little that is.",
    "You see our crowd was the skiing lot\nand we were off doing runs most days and dancing together in the evenings.",
    "But then\nShaitana seemed to take rather a fancy to Anne.",
    "You know went out of his way to pay her\ncompliments and all that.",
    "We ragged her about it rather.\u201d\n\u201cI just think he did it to annoy me\u201d said Anne.",
    "\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t like him.",
    "I think it amused\nhim to make me feel embarrassed.\u201d\n91\n\n\fRhoda said laughing \u201cWe told Anne it would be a nice rich marriage for her.",
    "She got\nsimply wild with us.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Battle \u201cyou\u2019d give me the names of the other people in your party\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t what I\u2019d call a trustful man\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cDo you think that every word we\u2019re\ntelling you is downright lies\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle twinkled.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going to make quite sure it isn\u2019t anyway\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou are suspicious\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "She scribbled some names on a piece of paper and gave it to him.",
    "Battle rose.",
    "\u201cWell thank you very much Miss Meredith\u201d he said \u201cAs Miss Dawes says you seem to\nhave led a particularly blameless life.",
    "I don\u2019t think you need worry much.",
    "It\u2019s odd the way\nMr. Shaitana\u2019s manner changed to you.",
    "You\u2019ll excuse my asking but he didn\u2019t ask you to\nmarry him \u2010 or \u2010 er \u2010 pester you with attentions of another kind\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t try to seduce her\u201d said Rhoda helpfully \u201cif that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\nAnne was blushing.",
    "\u201cNothing of the kind\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cHe was always most polite and \u2010 and \u2010\nformal.",
    "It was just his elaborate manners that made me uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u201cAnd little things he said or hinted\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2010 at least \u2010 no.",
    "He never hinted things.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.",
    "These lady killers do sometimes.",
    "Well good night Miss Meredith thank you very\nmuch.",
    "Excellent coffee.",
    "Good night Miss Dawes.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u201d said Rhoda as Anne came back into the room after shutting the front door after\nBattle.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s over and not so very terrible.",
    "He\u2019s a nice fatherly man and he evidently\ndoesn\u2019t suspect you in the least.",
    "It was all ever so much better than I expected.\u201d\nAnne sank down with a sigh.",
    "\u201cIt was really quite easy\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIt was silly of me to work\nmyself up so.",
    "I thought he\u2019d try to browbeat me \u2010 like K.C.\u2019s on the stage.\u201d\n\u201cHe looks sensible\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019d know well enough you\u2019re not a murdering kind of\nfemale.\u201d\nShe hesitated and then said \u201cI say Anne you didn\u2019t mention being at Croftways.",
    "Did you\nforget\u201d\nAnne said slowly \u201cI didn\u2019t think it counted.",
    "I was only there a few months.",
    "And there\u2019s no\none to ask about me there.",
    "I can write and tell him if you think it matters but I\u2019m sure it\ndoesn\u2019t.",
    "Let\u2019s leave it.\u201d\n92\n\n\f\u201cRight if you say so.\u201d\nRhoda rose and turned on the radio.",
    "A raucous voice said \u201cYou have just heard the Black Nubian play \u2018Why Do You Tell Me\nLies Baby\u2019\u201d\n\n93\n\n\f94\n\n\fChapter 15\nMajor Despard\nMajor Despard came out of the Albany turned sharply into Regent Street and jumped on\na bus.",
    "It was the quiet time of day the top of the bus had very few seats occupied.",
    "Despard\nmade his way forward and sat down on the front seat.",
    "He had jumped on the bus while it was going.",
    "Now it came to a halt took up passengers\nand made its way once more up Regent Street.",
    "A second traveller climbed the steps made his way forward and sat down in the front\nseat on the other side.",
    "Despard did not notice the newcomer but after a few minutes a tentative voice\nmurmured \u201cIt is a good view of London is it not that one gets from the top of a bus\u201d\nDespard turned his head.",
    "He looked puzzled for a moment then his face cleared.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon Monsieur Poirot.",
    "I didn\u2019t see it was you.",
    "Yes as you say one has a\ngood bird\u2019s\u2010eye view of the world from here.",
    "It was better though in the old days when\nthere wasn\u2019t all this caged\u2010in\u2010glass business.\u201d\nPoirot sighed.",
    "\u201cTout de m\u00eame it was not always agreeable in the wet weather when the\ninside was full.",
    "And there is much wet weather in this country.\u201d\n\u201cRain Rain never did any harm to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cYou are in error\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt leads often to a fluxion de poitrine.\u201d\nDespard smiled.",
    "\u201cI see you belong to the well\u2010wrapped\u2010up school Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\nPoirot was indeed well equipped against any treachery of an autumn day.",
    "He wore a\ngreatcoat and a muffler.",
    "\u201cRather odd running into you like this\u201d said Despard.",
    "He did not see the smile that the\nmuffler concealed.",
    "There was nothing odd in this encounter.",
    "Having ascertained a likely\nhour for Despard to leave his rooms Poirot had been waiting for him.",
    "He had prudently\nnot risked leaping on the bus but he had trotted after it to its next stopping place and\nboarded it there.",
    "\u201cTrue we have not seen each other since the evening at Mr. Shaitana\u2019s\u201d he replied.",
    "\u201cAren\u2019t you taking a hand in that business\u201d asked Despard.",
    "Poirot scratched his ear delicately.",
    "95\n\n\f\u201cI reflect\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI reflect a good deal.",
    "To run to and fro to make the investigations\nthat no.",
    "It does not suit my age my temperament or my figure.\u201d\nDespard said unexpectedly \u201cReflect eh Well you might do worse.",
    "There\u2019s too much\nrushing about nowadays.",
    "If people sat tight and thought about a thing before they tackled\nit there\u2019d be less mess\u2010ups than there are.\u201d\n\u201cIs that your procedure in life Major Despard\u201d\n\u201cUsually\u201d said the other simply.",
    "\u201cGet your bearings figure out your route weigh up the\npros and cons make your decision \u2010 and stick to it.\u201d His mouth set grimly.",
    "\u201cAnd after that nothing will turn you from your path eh\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cOh I don\u2019t say that.",
    "No use in being pigheaded over things.",

    "\u201cAnd even then there\nwere circumstances \u2010 but no matter.\u201d\n\u201cThat seems a pretty good record\u201d said Despard.",

    "\u201cUnder the nose of the Criminal\nInvestigation Department also.\u201d\n\u201cThat was probably a bad mistake\u201d said Poirot gravely.",
    "\u201cThe good square Superintendent\nBattle he may look wooden but he is not wooden in the head \u2010 not at all.\u201d\n\u201cI agree\u201d said Despard.",

    "Very efficient fellow.",
    "Varies his appearance\ntoo from time to time.",
    "Quite artistic about it.\u201d\n\u201cAh but that would not deceive you.",

    "A paper bag touched by her elbow fell from the desk and apples rolled energetically all\nover the floor.",
    "\u201cNever mind my dear don\u2019t bother someone will pick them up sometime.\u201d\nRather breathless Rhoda rose from a stooping position with five apples in her grasp.",
    "\u201cOh thank you \u2010 no I shouldn\u2019t put them back in the bag.",
    "I think it\u2019s got a hole in it.",
    "Put\nthem on the mantelpiece.",
    "That\u2019s right.",
    "Now then sit down and let\u2019s talk.\u201d\nRhoda accepted a second battered chair and focused her eyes on her hostess.",
    "\u201cI say I\u2019m terribly sorry.",
    "Am I interrupting or anything\u201d she asked breathlessly.",
    "\u201cWell you are and you aren\u2019t\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cI am working.",
    "As you see.",
    "But that\ndreadful Finn of mine has got himself terribly tangled up.",
    "He did some awfully clever\ndeduction with a dish of French beans and now he\u2019s just detected deadly poison in the\nsage and onion stuffing of the Michaelmas goose and I\u2019ve just remembered that French\nbeans are over by Michaelmas.\u201d\nThrilled by this peep into the inner world of creative detective fiction Rhoda said\nbreathlessly \u201cThey might be tinned.\u201d\n106\n\n\f\u201cThey might of course\u201d said Mrs. Oliver doubtfully.",
    "\u201cBut it would rather spoil the point.",
    "I\u2019m always getting tangled up in horticulture and things like that.",
    "People write to me and\nsay I\u2019ve got the wrong flowers all out together.",
    "As though it mattered \u2010 and anyway they\nare all out together in a London shop.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d said Rhoda loyally.",
    "\u201cOh Mrs. Oliver it must be marvellous\nto write.\u201d\nMrs. Oliver rubbed her forehead with a carbony finger and asked \u201cWhy\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said Rhoda a little taken aback.",
    "\u201cBecause it must.",
    "It must be wonderful just to sit\ndown and write off a whole book.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen exactly like that\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cOne actually has to think you\nknow.",
    "And thinking is always a bore.",
    "And you have to plan things.",
    "And then one gets stuck\nevery now and then and you feel you\u2019ll never get out of the mess \u2010 but you do Writing\u2019s\nnot particularly enjoyable.",
    "It\u2019s hard work like everything else.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like work\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cNot to you\u201d said Mrs. Oliver \u201cbecause you don\u2019t have to do it It feels very like work to\nme.",
    "Some days I can only keep going by repeating over and over to myself the amount of\nmoney I might get for my next serial rights.",
    "That spurs you on you know.",
    "So does your\nbankbook when you see how much overdrawn you are.\u201d\n\u201cI never imagined you actually typed your books yourself\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cI thought you\u2019d\nhave a secretary.\u201d\n\u201cI did have a secretary and I used to try and dictate to her but she was so competent that\nit used to depress me.",
    "I felt she knew so much more about English and grammar and full\nstops and semicolons than I did that it gave me a kind of inferiority complex.",
    "Then I tried\nhaving a thoroughly incompetent secretary but of course that didn\u2019t answer very well\neither.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be so wonderful to be able to think of things\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cI can always think of things\u201d said Mrs. Oliver happily.",
    "\u201cWhat is so tiring is writing them\ndown.",
    "I always think I\u2019ve finished and then when I count up I find I\u2019ve only written thirty\nthousand words instead of sixty thousand and so then I have to throw in another murder\nand get the heroine kidnapped again.",
    "It\u2019s all very boring.\u201d\nRhoda did not answer.",
    "She was staring at Mrs. Oliver with the reverence felt by youth for\ncelebrity \u2010 slightly tinged by disappointment.",
    "\u201cDo you like the wallpaper\u201d asked Mrs. Oliver waving an airy hand.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m frightfully fond\nof birds.",
    "The foliage is supposed to be tropical.",
    "It makes me feel it\u2019s a hot day even when\nit\u2019s freezing.",
    "I can\u2019t do anything unless I feel very very warm.",
    "But Sven Hjerson breaks the\nice on his bath every morning\u201d\n107\n\n\f\u201cI think it\u2019s all marvellous\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cAnd it\u2019s awfully nice of you to say I\u2019m not\ninterrupting you.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have some coffee and toast\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cVery black coffee and very hot\ntoast.",
    "I can always eat that any time.\u201d\nShe went to the door opened it and shouted.",
    "Then she returned and said \u201cWhat brings\nyou to town \u2010 shopping\u201d\n\u201cYes I\u2019ve been doing some shopping.\u201d\n\u201cIs Miss Meredith up too\u201d\n\u201cYes she\u2019s gone with Major Despard to a solicitor.\u201d\n\u201cSolicitor eh\u201d Mrs. Oliver\u2019s brows rose inquiringly.",
    "\u201cYes you see Major Despard told her she ought to have one.",
    "He\u2019s been awfully kind \u2010 he\nreally has.\u201d\n\u201cI was kind too\u201d said Mrs. Oliver \u201cbut it didn\u2019t seem to go down very well did it In fact I\nthink your friend rather resented my coming.\u201d\n\u201cOh she didn\u2019t \u2010 really she didn\u2019t.\u201d Rhoda wriggled on her chair in a paroxysm of\nembarrassment.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s really one reason why I wanted to come today \u2010 to explain.",
    "You\nsee I saw you had got it all wrong.",
    "She did seem very ungracious but it wasn\u2019t that really.",
    "I mean it wasn\u2019t your coming.",
    "It was something you said.\u201d\n\u201cSomething I said\u201d\n\u201cYes you couldn\u2019t tell of course.",
    "It was just unfortunate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did I say\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect you remember even.",
    "It was just the way you put it.",
    "You said something\nabout an accident and poison.\u201d\n\u201cDid I\u201d\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d probably not remember.",
    "Yes you see Anne had a ghastly experience once.",
    "She was in a house where a woman took some poison \u2010 hat paint I think it was \u2010 by\nmistake for something else.",
    "And she died.",
    "And of course it was an awful shock to Anne.",
    "She can\u2019t bear thinking of it or speaking of it.",
    "And your saying that reminded her of\ncourse and she dried up and got all stiff and queer like she does.",
    "And I saw you noticed it.",
    "And I couldn\u2019t say anything in front of her.",
    "But I did want you to know that it wasn\u2019t what\nyou thought.",
    "She wasn\u2019t ungrateful.\u201d\nMrs. Oliver looked at Rhoda\u2019s Hushed eager face.",
    "She said slowly \u201cI see.\u201d\n108\n\n\f\u201cAnne\u2019s awfully sensitive\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cAnd she\u2019s bad about \u2010 well facing things.",
    "If\nanything\u2019s upset her she\u2019d just rather not talk about it \u2010 although that isn\u2019t any good really\n\u2010 at least I don\u2019t think so.",
    "Things are there just the some whether you talk about them or\nnot.",
    "It\u2019s only running away from them to pretend they don\u2019t exist.",
    "I\u2019d rather have it all out\nhowever painful it would be.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Mrs. Oliver quietly.",
    "\u201cbut you my dear are a soldier.",
    "Your Anne isn\u2019t.\u201d\nRhoda flushed.",
    "\u201cAnne\u2019s a darling.\u201d\nMrs. Oliver smiled.",
    "She said \u201cI didn\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t.",
    "I only said she hadn\u2019t got your particular brand of\ncourage.\u201d\nShe sighed then said rather unexpectedly to the girl \u201cDo you believe in the value of truth\nmy dear or don\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cOf course I believe in the truth\u201d said Rhoda staring.",
    "\u201cYes you say that but perhaps you haven\u2019t thought about it.",
    "The truth hurts sometimes \u2010\nand destroys one\u2019s illusions.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have it all the same\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cSo would I.",
    "But I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re wise.\u201d\nRhoda said earnestly.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t tell Anne will you what I\u2019ve told you She wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly shouldn\u2019t dream of doing any such thing.",
    "Was this long ago\u201d\n\u201cAbout four or five years ago.",
    "It\u2019s odd isn\u2019t it how the same things happen again and\nagain to people.",
    "I had an aunt who was always in shipwrecks.",
    "And here\u2019s Anne mixed up in\ntwo sudden deaths \u2010 only of course this one is much worse.",
    "Murder\u2019s rather awful isn\u2019t\nit\u201d\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d\nThe black coffee and the hot buttered toast appeared at this minute.",
    "Rhoda ate and drank\nwith childish gusto.",
    "It was very exciting to her thus to be sharing an intimate meal with a\ncelebrity.",
    "When they had finished she rose and said \u201cI do hope I haven\u2019t interrupted you too\nterribly.",
    "Would you mind \u2010 I mean would it bother you awfully if I sent one of your books\nto you would you sign it for me\u201d\n\n109\n\n\fMrs. Oliver laughed.",
    "\u201cOh I can do better than that for you.\u201d She opened a cupboard at the\nfar end of the room.",
    "\u201cWhich would you like I rather fancy \u2018The Affair of the Second\nGoldfish\u2019 myself.",
    "It\u2019s not quite such frightful tripe as the rest.\u201d\nA little shocked at hearing an authoress thus describe the children of her pen Rhoda\naccepted eagerly.",
    "Mrs. Oliver took the book opened it inscribed her name with a\nsuperlative flourish and handed it to Rhoda.",
    "\u201cThere you are.\u201d\n\u201cThank you very much.",
    "I have enjoyed myself.",
    "Sure you didn\u2019t mind my coming\u201d\n\u201cI wanted you to\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She added after a moment\u2019s pause \u201cYou\u2019re a nice child.",
    "Good\u2010bye.",
    "Take care of yourself\nmy dear.\u201d\n\u201cNow why did I say that\u201d she murmured to herself as the door closed behind her guest.",
    "She shook her head milled her hair and returned to the masterly dealings of Sven Hjerson\nwith the sage and onion stuffing.",
    "110\n\n\fChapter 18\nTea Interlude\nMrs. Lorrimer came out of a certain door in Harley Street.",
    "She stood for a minute at the\ntop of the steps and then she descended them slowly.",
    "There was a curious expression on her face \u2010 a mingling of grim determination and of\nstrange indecision.",
    "She bent her brows a little as though to concentrate on some all\u2010\nabsorbing problem.",
    "It was just then that she caught sight of Anne Meredith on the opposite pavement.",
    "Anne\nwas standing staring up at a big block of flats just on the corner.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer hesitated a moment then she crossed the street.",
    "\u201cHow do you do Miss\nMeredith\u201d\nAnne started and turned.",
    "\u201cOh how do you do\u201d\n\u201cStill in London\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "I\u2019ve only come up for the day.",
    "To do some legal business.\u201d\nHer eyes were still straying back to the big block of flats.",

    "\u201cThe matter Oh no what should be the matter\u201d\n\u201cYou were looking as though you had something on your mind.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t \u2010 well at least I have \u2010 but it\u2019s nothing important something quite silly.\u201d She\nlaughed a little.",
    "She went on \u201cIt\u2019s only that I thought I saw my friend \u2010 the girl I live with \u2010 go in there and I\nwondered if she\u2019d gone to see Mrs. Oliver.\u201d\n\u201cIs that where Mrs. Oliver lives I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "She came to see us the other day and she gave us her address and asked us to come\nand see her.",

    "\u201cThere is a shop quite near here that I\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you\u201d said Anne hesitating.",
    "Side by side they walked down the street and turned into a side street.",
    "In a small\npastrycook\u2019s they were served with tea and muffins.",
    "They did not talk much.",
    "Each of them\nseemed to find the other\u2019s silence restful.",
    "Anne asked suddenly \u201cHas Mrs. Oliver been to see you\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer shook her head.",

    "\u201cThe usual things I suppose.",
    "Routine inquiries.",
    "He was very\npleasant over it all.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose he interviewed everyone.\u201d\n\u201cI should think so.\u201d There was another pause.",
    "Anne asked \u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer do you think \u2010 they will ever find out who did it\u201d\nHer eyes were bent on her plate.",
    "She did not see the curious expression in the older\nwoman\u2019s eyes as she watched the downcast head.",

    "\u201cI might be run over by a bus on the way home\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYes that is true.",
    "And I \u2010 might not.\u201d Mrs. Lorrimer said it in an odd way.",

    "Pal of his was\nbeing mauled by a lion.\u201d\nBattle sighed.",

    "What do you say Monsieur Poirot\u201d\n\u201cI agree with you Battle.",
    "I have always disapproved of murder.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a delightfully droll way of putting it\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",

    "That is what is so dangerous.",
    "Once a man is imbued with the idea that he knows who ought to be allowed to live and\nwho ought not \u2010 then he is half way to becoming the most dangerous killer there is the\narrogant criminal who kills not for profit but for an idea.",

    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stop with you.",
    "Too much to do.",

    "Shouldn\u2019t be surprised if there never was an end.",
    "Even if you find out who\ndid it it\u2019s going to be next to impossible to prove.",
    "I\u2019ve given you the facts you wanted but\nin my opinion Despard\u2019s not the man.",
    "I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s ever committed murder.",
    "Shaitana may have heard some garbled rumour of Professor Luxmore\u2019s death but I don\u2019t\nbelieve there\u2019s more to it than that.",
    "Despard\u2019s a white man and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s ever\nbeen a murderer.",
    "That\u2019s my opinion.",
    "And I know something of men.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Mrs. Luxmore like\u201d asked Battle.",
    "\u201cShe lives in London so you can see for yourself.",
    "You\u2019ll find the address among those\npapers.",
    "Somewhere in South Kensington.",
    "But I repeat Despard isn\u2019t the man.\u201d Colonel\nRace left the room stepping with the springy noiseless tread of a hunter.",
    "Battle nodded his head thoughtfully as the door closed behind him.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s probably right\u201d\nhe said.",
    "\u201cHe knows men Colonel Race does.",
    "But all the same one can\u2019t take anything for\ngranted.\u201d\nHe looked through the mass of documents Race had deposited on the table occasionally\nmaking a pencil note on the pad beside him.",

    "\u201cThis is all very irregular Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I hope you realize that.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose for a moment you\u2019ll tell us anything you\ndon\u2019t want to.\u201d\nBattle shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said decidedly.",
    "\u201cCards on the table.",
    "That\u2019s the motto for this business.",
    "I mean to\nplay fair.\u201d\nMrs. Oliver hitched her chair nearer.",
    "\u201cTell us\u201d she begged.",
    "Superintendent Battle said slowly \u201cFirst of all I\u2019ll say this.",
    "As far as the actual murder of\nMr. Shaitana goes I\u2019m not a penny the wiser.",
    "There\u2019s no hint nor clue of any kind to be\nfound in his papers.",
    "As for the four others I\u2019ve had them shadowed naturally but without\nany tangible result.",
    "That was only to be expected.",
    "No as Monsieur Poirot said there\u2019s only\none hope \u2010 the past.",
    "Find out what crime exactly if any these people have committed \u2010\nand it may tell you who committed this crime.\u201d\n\u201cWell have you found out anything\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a line on one of them\u201d\n\u201cWhich\u201d\n\u201cDoctor Roberts.\u201d\nMrs. Oliver looked at him with thrilled expectations.",
    "\u201cAs Monsieur Poirot here knows I tried out all kinds of theories.",
    "I established the fact\npretty clearly that none of his immediate family had met with a sudden death.",
    "I\u2019ve\nexplored every alley as well as I could and the whole thing boils down to one possibility \u2010\nand rather an outside possibility at that.",
    "A few years ago Roberts must have been guilty of\nindiscretion at least with one of his lady patients.",
    "There may have been nothing in it \u2010\nprobably wasn\u2019t but the woman was the hysterical emotional kind who likes to make a\nscene and either the husband got wind of what was going on or his wife confessed.",
    "Anyway the fat was in the fire as far as the doctor was concerned.",
    "Enraged husband\nthreatening to report him to the General Medical Council \u2010 which would probably have\nmeant the ruin of his professional career.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened\u201d demanded Mrs. Oliver breathlessly.",
    "\u201cApparently Roberts managed to calm down the irate gentleman temporarily \u2010 and he\ndied of anthrax almost immediately afterward.\u201d\n120\n\n\f\u201cAnthrax But that\u2019s a cattle disease\u201d\nThe superintendent grinned.",
    "\u201cQuite right Mrs. Oliver.",
    "It isn\u2019t the untraceable arrow\npoison of the South American Indians You may remember that there was rather a scare\nabout infected shaving brushes of cheap make about that time.",
    "Craddock\u2019s shaving brush\nwas proved to have been the cause of infection.\u201d\n\u201cDid Doctor Roberts attend him\u201d\n\u201cOh no.",
    "Too canny for that.",
    "Daresay Craddock wouldn\u2019t have wanted him in any case.",
    "The\nonly evidence I\u2019ve got \u2010 and that\u2019s precious little \u2010 is that among the doctor\u2019s patients there\nwas a case of anthrax at the time.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the doctor infected the shaving brush\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big idea.",
    "And mind you it\u2019s only an idea.",
    "Nothing whatever to go on.",
    "Pure\nconjecture.",
    "But it could be.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t marry Mrs. Craddock afterward\u201d\n\u201cOh dear me no I imagine the affection was always on the lady\u2019s side.",
    "She tended to cut\nup rough I hear but suddenly went off to Egypt quite happily for the winter.",
    "She died\nthere.",
    "A case of some obscure blood poisoning.",
    "It\u2019s got a long name but I don\u2019t expect it\nwould convey much to you.",
    "Most uncommon in this country fairly common among the\nnatives in Egypt.\u201d\n\u201cSo the doctor couldn\u2019t have poisoned her\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Battle slowly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve been chatting to a bacteriologist friend of mind \u2010\nawfully difficult to get straight answers out of these people.",
    "They never can say yes or no.",
    "It\u2019s always \u2018that might be possible under certain conditions\u2019 \u2010 \u2018it would depend on the\npathological condition of the recipient\u2019 \u2010 \u2018such cases have been known\u2019 \u2010 \u2018a lot depends on\nindividual idiosyncrasy\u2019 \u2010 all that sort of stuff.",
    "But as far as I could pin my friend down I got\nat this \u2010 the germ or germs I suppose might have been introduced into the blood before\nleaving England.",
    "The symptoms would not make their appearance for some time to\ncome.\u201d\nPoirot asked \u201cWas Mrs. Craddock inoculated for typhoid before going to Egypt Most\npeople are I fancy.\u201d\n\u201cGood for you Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Doctor Roberts did the inoculation\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.",
    "There you are again \u2010 we can\u2019t prove anything.",
    "She had the usual two\ninoculations \u2010 and they may have been typhoid inoculations for all we know.",
    "Or one of\nthem may have been typhoid inoculation and the other \u2010 something else.",
    "We don\u2019t know.",
    "We never shall know.",
    "The whole thing is pure hypothesis.",
    "All we can say is \u2018It might be.\u2019\u201d\n121\n\n\fPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cIt agrees very well with some remarks made to me by Mr. Shaitana.",
    "He was exalting the\nsuccessful murderer the man against whom his crime could never be brought home.\u201d\n\u201cHow did Mr. Shaitana know about it then\u201d asked Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cThat we shall never learn.",
    "He himself was in Egypt at one\ntime.",
    "We know that because he met Mrs. Lorrimer there.",
    "He may have heard some local\ndoctor comment on curious features of Mrs. Craddock\u2019s case \u2010 a wonder as to how the\ninfection arose.",
    "At some other time he may have heard gossip about Roberts and Mrs.\nCraddock.",
    "He might have amused himself by making some cryptic remark to the doctor\nand noted the startled awareness in his eye \u2010 all that one can never know.",
    "Some people\nhave an uncanny gift of divining secrets.",
    "Mr. Shaitana was one of those people.",
    "All that\ndoes not concern us.",
    "We have only to say \u2010 he guessed.",
    "Did he guess right\u201d\n\u201cWell I think he did\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve a feeling that our cheerful genial doctor wouldn\u2019t\nbe too scrupulous.",
    "I\u2019ve known one or two like him \u2010 wonderful how certain types resemble\neach other.",
    "In my opinion he\u2019s a killer all right.",
    "He killed Craddock.",
    "He may have killed Mrs.\nCraddock if she was beginning to be a nuisance and cause a scandal.",
    "But did he kill\nShaitana That\u2019s the real question.",
    "And comparing the crimes I rather doubt it.",
    "In the case\nof the Craddocks he used medical methods each time.",
    "The deaths appeared to be due to\nnatural causes.",
    "In my opinion if he had killed Shaitana he would have done so in a\nmedical way.",
    "He\u2019d have used the germ and not the knife.\u201d\n\u201cI never thought it was him\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cNot for a minute.",
    "He\u2019s too obvious\nsomehow.\u201d\n\u201cExit Roberts\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd the others\u201d\nBattle made a gesture of impatience.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve pretty well drawn blank.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s been a widow for twenty years now.",
    "She\u2019s\nlived in London most of the time occasionally going abroad in the winter.",
    "Civilized places \u2010\nthe Riviera Egypt that sort of thing.",
    "Can\u2019t find any mysterious deaths associated with her.",
    "She seems to have led a perfectly normal respectable life the life of a woman of the\nworld.",
    "Everyone seems to respect her and to have the highest opinion of her character.",
    "The worst that they can say about her is that she doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly I don\u2019t mind\nadmitting I\u2019ve been beaten all along the line there.",
    "And yet there must be something\nShaitana thought there was.\u201d\nHe sighed in a dispirited manner.",
    "\u201cThen there\u2019s Miss Meredith.",
    "I\u2019ve got her history taped\nout quite clearly.",
    "Usual sort of story.",
    "Army officer\u2019s daughter.",
    "Left with very little money.",
    "Had to earn her living.",
    "Not properly trained for anything.",
    "I\u2019ve checked up on her early days\nat Cheltenham.",
    "All quite straightforward.",
    "Everyone very sorry for the poor little thing.",
    "She\nwent first to some people in the Isle of Wight \u2010 kind of nursery\u2010governess and mother\u2019s\nhelp.",
    "The woman she was with is out in Palestine but I\u2019ve talked with her sister and she\n122\n\n\fsays Mrs. Eldon liked the girl very much.",
    "Certainly no mysterious deaths nor anything of\nthat kind.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Eldon went abroad Miss Meredith went to Devonshire and took a post as\ncompanion to an aunt of a school friend.",
    "The school friend is the girl she is living with now\n\u2010 Miss Rhoda Dawes.",
    "She was there over two years until Mrs. Deering got too ill and had to\nhave a regular trained nurse.",
    "Cancer I gather.",
    "She\u2019s alive still but very vague.",
    "Kept under\nmorphia a good deal I imagine.",
    "I had an interview with her.",
    "She remembered Anne said\nshe was a nice child.",
    "I also talked to a neighbour of hers who would be better able to\nremember the happenings of the last few years.",
    "No deaths in the parish except one or two\nof the older villagers with whom as far as I can make out Anne Meredith never came into\ncontact.\u201d\n\u201cSince then there\u2019s been Switzerland.",
    "Thought I might get on the track of some fatal\naccident there but nothing doing.",
    "And there\u2019s nothing in Wallingford either.\u201d\n\u201cSo Anne Meredith is acquitted\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "Battle hesitated.",
    "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that.",
    "There\u2019s something.",
    "There\u2019s a scared look about her\nthat can\u2019t quite be accounted for by panic over Shaitana.",
    "She\u2019s too watchful.",
    "Too much on\nthe alert.",
    "I\u2019d swear there was something.",
    "But there it is \u2010 she\u2019s led a perfectly blameless\nlife.\u201d\nMrs. Oliver took a deep breath \u2010 a breath of pure enjoyment.",
    "\u201cAnd yet\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cAnne Meredith was in the house when a woman took poison by\nmistake and died.\u201d\nShe had nothing to complain of in the effect her words produced.",
    "Superintendent Battle spun round in his chair and stared at her in amazement.",
    "\u201cIs this true Mrs. Oliver How do you know\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sleuthing\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cI get on with girls.",

    "The Rhoda girl was\nfriendly \u2010 oh and rather impressed by thinking I was a celebrity.",
    "The little Meredith hated\nmy coming and showed it quite plainly.",
    "She was suspicious.",
    "Why should she be if she\nhasn\u2019t got anything to hide I asked either of them to come and see me in London.",
    "The\nRhoda girl did and she blurted the whole thing out \u2010 how Anne had been rude to me the\nother day because something I\u2019d said had reminded her of a painful incident and then she\nwent on to describe the incident.\u201d\n\u201cDid she say when and where it happened\u201d\n\u201cFour or five years ago in Devonshire.\u201d\n\n123\n\n\fThe superintendent muttered something under his breath and scribbled on his pad.",

    "\u201cYou\u2019ve put\none over on us this time.",
    "That is very valuable information.",

    "A couple of months at most.",
    "It must\nhave been between the Isle of Wight and going to Mrs. Deering.",
    "Yes that could be it right\nenough.",

    "The sister was rather a precise party.",

    "I was only curious.",
    "Continue Superintendent\nBattle.\u201d\n\u201cIn the same way\u201d went on Battle \u201cI took it for granted that she went to Mrs. Deering\nstraight from the Isle of Wight.",

    "She deceived me all right.",
    "Lying the\nwhole time.\u201d\n\u201cLying is not always a sign of guilt\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI know that Monsieur Poirot.",

    "Always says the thing that sounds best.",
    "But all the same it\u2019s a pretty grave\nrisk to take suppressing facts like that.\u201d\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t know you had any idea of past crimes\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason for not suppressing that little piece of information.",
    "It must\nhave been accepted as a bona fide case of accidental death so she\u2019d nothing to fear \u2010\nunless she were guilty.\u201d\n\u201cUnless she were guilty of the Devonshire death yes\u201d said Poirot.",
    "124\n\n\fBattle turned to him.",
    "\u201cOh I know.",
    "Even if that accidental death turns out to be not so\naccidental it doesn\u2019t follow that she killed Shaitana.",
    "But these other murders are murders\ntoo.",
    "I want to be able to bring home a crime to the person responsible for it.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to Mr. Shaitana that is impossible\u201d remarked Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt is in Roberts\u2019s case.",
    "It remains to be seen if it is in Miss Meredith\u2019s.",
    "I shall go down to\nDevon tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWill you know where to go\u201d asked Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t like to ask Rhoda for more\ndetails.\u201d\n\u201cNo that was wise of you.",
    "I shan\u2019t have much difficulty.",
    "There must have been an inquest.",
    "I shall find it in the coroner\u2019s records.",
    "That\u2019s routine police work.",
    "They\u2019ll have it all taped\nout for me by tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Major Despard\u201d asked Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cHave you found out anything about\nhim\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for Colonel Race\u2019s report.",
    "I\u2019ve had him shadowed of course.",
    "One rather\ninteresting thing he went down to see Miss Meredith at Wallingford.",
    "You remember he\nsaid he\u2019d never met her until the other night.\u201d\n\u201cBut she is a very pretty girl\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "Battle laughed.",
    "\u201cYes I expect that\u2019s all there is to it.",
    "By the way Despard\u2019s taking no chances.",
    "He\u2019s already\nconsulted a solicitor.",
    "That looks as though he\u2019s expecting trouble.\u201d\n\u201cHe is a man who looks ahead\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cHe is a man who prepares for every\ncontingency.\u201d\n\u201cAnd therefore not the kind of man to stick a knife into a man in a hurry\u201d said Battle with\na sigh.",
    "\u201cNot unless it was the only way\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cHe can act quickly remember.\u201d\nBattle looked across the table at him.",
    "\u201cNow Monsieur Poirot what about your cards Haven\u2019t seen your hand down on the\ntable yet.\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cThere is so little in it.",
    "You think I conceal facts from you It is not so.",
    "I have\nnot learned many facts.",
    "I have talked with Doctor Roberts with Mrs. Lorrimer with Major\nDespard I have still to talk to Miss Meredith and what have I learned This.",
    "That Doctor\nRoberts is a keen observer that Mrs. Lorrimer on the other hand has a most remarkable\npower of concentration but is in consequence almost blind to her surroundings.",
    "But she\n125\n\n\fis fond of flowers.",
    "Despard notices only those things which appeal to him \u2010 rugs trophies\nof sport \u2010 he has neither what I call the outward vision seeing details all around you \u2010 what\nis called an observant person nor the inner vision \u2010 concentration the focusing of the\nmind on one object.",
    "He has a purposefully limited vision He sees only what blends and\nharmonizes with the bent of his mind.\u201d\n\u201cSo those are what you call facts eh\u201d said Battle curiously.",
    "\u201cThey are facts.",
    "Very small fry perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Miss Meredith\u201d\n\u201cI have left her to the end.",
    "But I shall question her too as to what she remembers in that\nroom.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd method of approach\u201d said Battle thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cPurely psychological.",
    "Suppose\nthey\u2019re leading you up the garden path\u201d\nPoirot shook his head with a smile.",
    "\u201cNo that would be impossible.",
    "Whether they try to\nhinder or to help they necessarily reveal their type of mind.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in it no doubt\u201d said Battle thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t work that way\nmyself though.\u201d\nPoirot said still smiling \u201cI feel I have done very little in comparison with you and with Mrs.\nOliver \u2010 and with Colonel Race.",
    "My cards that I place on the table are very low ones.\u201d\nBattle twinkled at him.",
    "\u201cAs to that Monsieur Poirot the two of trumps is a low card but it\ncan take anyone of three aces.",
    "All the same I\u2019m going to ask you to do a practical job of\nwork.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that is\u201d\n\u201cI want you to interview Professor Luxmore\u2019s widow.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why do you not do that yourself\u201d\n\u201cBecause as I said just now I\u2019m off to Devonshire.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you not do that yourself\u201d repeated Poirot.",
    "\u201cWon\u2019t be put off will you Well I\u2019ll speak the truth.",
    "I think you\u2019ll get more out of her\nthan I shall.\u201d\n\u201cMy methods being less straightforward\u201d\n\u201cYou can put it that way if you like\u201d said Battle grinning.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve heard Inspector Japp say\nthat you\u2019ve got a tortuous mind.\u201d\n126\n\n\f\u201cLike the late Mr. Shaitana\u201d\n\u201cYou think he would have been able to get things out of her\u201d\nPoirot said slowly \u201cI rather think he did get things out of her\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think so\u201d asked Battle sharply.",
    "\u201cA chance remark of Major Despard\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cGave himself away did he That sounds unlike him.\u201d\n\u201cOh my dear friend it is impossible not to give oneself away \u2010 unless one never opens\none\u2019s mouth Speech is the deadliest of revealers.\u201d\n\u201cEven if people tell lies\u201d asked Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cYes Madame because it can be seen at once that you tell a certain kind of lie.\u201d\n\u201cYou make me feel quite uncomfortable\u201d said Mrs. Oliver getting up.",

    "\u201cOf course he\u2019s idiotic.",
    "But people like him.",
    "Good\u2010bye.\u201d\n\u201cI too must depart\u201d said Poirot.",
    "Battle scribbled an address on a piece of paper and shoved it into Poirot\u2019s hand.",
    "\u201cThere you are.",
    "Go and tackle her.\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cAnd what do you want me to find out\u201d\n\u201cThe truth about Professor Luxmore\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cMon cher Battle Does anybody know the truth about anything\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to about this business in Devonshire\u201d said the superintendent with decision.",

    "Oh well she seems to be stringing him along good\nand proper.",
    "Hose at such a price indeed\u201d\nUnaware of the low estimate formed by the young ladies upon his character Poirot was\ntrotting homeward.",
    "He had been in for about half an hour when he heard the doorbell ring.",
    "A few minutes\nlater Major Despard entered the room.",
    "He was obviously keeping his temper with\ndifficulty.",
    "\u201cWhat the devil did you want to go and see Mrs. Luxmore for\u201d he asked.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "\u201cI wished you see for the true story of Professor Luxmore\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cTrue story Do you think that woman\u2019s capable of telling the truth about anything\u201d\ndemanded Despard wrathfully.",
    "\u201cEh bien I did wonder now and then\u201d admitted Poirot.",
    "\u201cI should think you did That woman\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nPoirot demurred.",
    "\u201cNot at all.",
    "She is a romantic woman that is all.\u201d\n\u201cRomantic be damned.",
    "She\u2019s an out\u2010and\u2010out liar I sometimes think she even believes her\nown lies.\u201d\n\u201cIt is quite possible.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s an appalling woman I had a hell of a time with her out there.\u201d\n\u201cThat also I can well believe.\u201d\nDespard sat down abruptly.",
    "\u201cLook here Monsieur Poirot I\u2019m going to tell you the truth.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you are going to give me your version of the story\u201d\n\u201cMy version will be the true version.\u201d\n136\n\n\fPoirot did not reply.",
    "Despard went on dryly \u201cI quite realize that I can\u2019t claim any merit in\ncoming out with this.",
    "I\u2019ll tell the truth because it\u2019s the only thing to be done at this stage.",
    "Whether you believe me or not is up to you.",
    "I\u2019ve no kind of proof that my story is the\ncorrect one.\u201d\nHe paused for a minute and then began.",
    "\u201cI arranged the trip for the Luxmores.",
    "He was a nice old boy quite batty about mosses and\nplants and things.",
    "She was a \u2010 well she was what you\u2019ve no doubt observed her to be\nThat trip was a nightmare.",
    "I didn\u2019t care a damn for the woman \u2010 rather disliked her as a\nmatter of fact.",
    "She was the intense soulful kind that always makes me feel prickly with\nembarrassment.",
    "Everything went all right for the first fortnight.",
    "Then we all had a go of\nfever.",
    "She and I had it slightly.",
    "Old Luxmore was pretty bad.",
    "One night \u2010 now you\u2019ve got to\nlisten to this carefully \u2010 I was sitting outside my tent Suddenly I saw Luxmore in the\ndistance staggering off into the bush by the river.",
    "He was absolutely delirious and quite\nunconscious of what he was doing.",
    "In another minute he would be in the river and at that\nparticular spot it would have been the end of him.",
    "No chance of a rescue.",
    "There wasn\u2019t\ntime to rush after him only one thing to be done.",
    "My rifle was beside me as usual.",
    "I\nsnatched it up.",
    "I\u2019m a pretty accurate shot.",
    "I was quite sure I could bring the old boy down \u2010\nget him in the leg.",
    "And then just as I fired that idiotic fool of a woman flung herself from\nsomewhere upon me yelping out \u2018Don\u2019t shoot.",
    "For God\u2019s sake don\u2019t shoot\u2019 She caught\nmy arm and jerked it ever so slightly just as the rifle went off \u2010 with the result that the\nbullet got him in the back and killed him dead\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you that was a pretty ghastly moment And that damned fool of a woman still\ndidn\u2019t understand what she\u2019d done.",
    "Instead of realizing that she\u2019d been responsible for\nher husband\u2019s death she firmly believed that I\u2019d been trying to shoot the old boy in cold\nblood \u2010 for love of her if yon please We had the devil of a scene she insisting that we\nshould say he\u2019d died of fever.",
    "I was sorry for her especially as I saw she didn\u2019t realize what\nshe\u2019d done But she\u2019d have to realize it if the truth came out.",
    "And then her complete\ncertainty that I was head over heels in love with her gave me a bit of a jar.",
    "It was going to\nbe a pretty kettle of fish if she went about giving that out.",
    "In the end I agreed to do what\nshe wanted \u2010 partly for the sake of peace I\u2019ll admit.",
    "After all it didn\u2019t seem to matter\nmuch.",
    "Fever or accident.",
    "And I didn\u2019t want to drag a woman through a lot of\nunpleasantness even if she was a damned fool.",
    "I gave it out next day that the professor\nwas dead of fever and we buried him The bearers knew the truth of course but they\nwere all devoted to me and I knew that what I said they\u2019d swear to if need be.",
    "We buried\npoor old Luxmore and got back to civilization.",

    "\u201cHe must have heard it from Mrs. Luxmore.",
    "Easy enough to get the story\nout of her.",
    "That sort of thing would have amused him.\u201d\n\n137\n\n\f\u201cIt might have been a dangerous story \u2010 to you \u2010 in the hands of a man like Shaitana.\u201d\nDespard shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of Shaitana.\u201d\nPoirot didn\u2019t answer.",
    "Despard said quietly \u201cThat again you have to take my word for.",
    "It\u2019s\ntrue enough I suppose that I had a kind of motive for Shaitana\u2019s death.",
    "Well the truth\u2019s\nout now take it or leave it.\u201d\nPoirot held out a hand.",
    "\u201cI will take it Major Despard.",
    "I have no doubt at all that things in\nSouth America happened exactly as you have described.\u201d\nDespard\u2019s face lighted up.",
    "\u201cThanks\u201d he said laconically.",
    "And he clasped Poirot\u2019s hand warmly.",
    "138\n\n\fChapter 22\nEvidence from Combeacre\nSuperintendent Battle was in the police station of Combeacre.",

    "Seemed all as right as rain.",
    "The doctor was satisfied.",
    "Everyone was\nsatisfied.",

    "I want to get it quite clear.\u201d\n\u201cSyrup of Figs that\u2019s what the bottle was.",
    "She took it regular it seems.",
    "Then there was\nthis hat paint she\u2019d been using or rather the young lady her companion had been using\nfor her.",
    "Brightening up a garden hat.",
    "There was a good deal left over and the bottle\nbroke and Mrs. Benson herself said \u2018Put it in that old bottle \u2010 the Syrup of Figs bottle.\u2019\nThat\u2019s all right.",
    "The servants heard her.",
    "The young lady Miss Meredith and the\nhousemaid and the parlour\u2010maid \u2010 they all agree on that.",

    "Careless of course the coroner commented on that.\u201d\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cOn this particular night the deceased went into the bathroom took down a Syrup of Figs\nbottle poured herself out a good dose and drank it.",
    "Realized what she\u2019d done and they\nsent off at once for the doctor.",
    "He was out on a case and it was sometime before they\ncould get at him.",
    "They did all they could but she died.\u201d\n\u201cShe herself believed it to be an accident\u201d\n\u201cOh yes everyone thought so.",
    "It seems clear the bottles must have got mixed up\nsomehow.",
    "It was suggested the housemaid did it when she dusted but she swears she\ndidn\u2019t.\u201d\nSuperintendent Battle was silent thinking.",
    "Such an easy business.",
    "A bottle taken down\nfrom an upper shelf put in place of the other.",
    "So difficult to trace a mistake like that to its\nsource.",
    "Handled it with gloves possibly and anyway the last prints would be those of Mrs.\nBenson herself.",
    "Yes so easy \u2010 so simple.",
    "But all the same murder The perfect crime.",

    "Young ladies didn\u2019t stay long as a rule.\u201d\nBattle was still puzzled.",
    "Young ladies didn\u2019t stay long.",
    "A difficult woman evidently.",
    "But if\nAnne Meredith had been unhappy she could have left as her predecessors had done.",
    "No\nneed to kill \u2010 unless it were sheer unreasoning vindictiveness.",

    "But Mrs. Benson had died and Anne Meredith had not told him that\nshe had been at Combeacre.",
    "It was all profoundly unsatisfactory.",
    "He made diligent and painstaking inquiries.",
    "The doctor was clear and emphatic.",
    "No reason\nto believe it was anything but an accident.",
    "Miss \u2010 couldn\u2019t remember her name nice girl\nbut rather helpless \u2010 had been very upset and distressed.",
    "There was the vicar.",

    "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult.",
    "I don\u2019t really think I remember.",
    "I\ncouldn\u2019t say what the wallpaper was like.",

    "But then no more is Hercule Poirot If she\nknew me better she would realize I would never lay a piege as gross as that\nAloud he said \u201cA case of Egyptian jewellery you say\u201d\nAnne answered with some enthusiasm.",
    "\u201cYes \u2010 some of it was lovely.",
    "Blues and red.",
    "Enamel.",
    "One or two lovely rings.",
    "And scarabs \u2010 but I don\u2019t like them so much.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a great collector Mr. Shaitana\u201d murmured Poirot.",

    "\u201cThe room was full of stuff.",
    "One couldn\u2019t begin to\nlook at it all.\u201d\n\u201cSo that you cannot mention anything else that particularly struck your notice.\u201d\nAnne smiled a little as she said \u201cOnly a vase of chrysanthemums that badly wanted their\nwater changed.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes servants are not always too particular about that.\u201d Poirot was silent for a\nmoment or two.",
    "Anne said timidly \u201cI\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t noticed \u2010 whatever it is you wanted me to notice.\u201d\nPoirot smiled kindly.",

    "My tastes alas are rather old\u2010fashioned.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d queried Anne kindly.",
    "\u201cSilk hose now are silk hose a welcome present to receive\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed.",
    "It\u2019s always nice to be given hose.\u201d\n\u201cYou relieve my mind.",
    "I will ask my favour.",
    "I have obtained some different colours.",
    "There\nare I think about fifteen or sixteen pairs.",
    "Could you be so amiable as to look through\nthem and set aside half a dozen pairs that seem to you the most desirable\u201d\n\u201cCertainly I will\u201d said Anne laughing as she rose.",
    "Poirot directed her toward a table in an alcove \u2010 a table whose contents were strangely at\nvariance had she but known it with the well\u2010known order and neatness of Hercule Poirot.",
    "There were hose piled up in untidy heaps some fur\u2010lined gloves calendars and boxes of\nbonbons.",
    "\u201cI send oft my parcels very much \u00e0 l\u2019avance\u201d Poirot explained.",
    "\u201cSee mademoiselle here\nare the hose.",
    "Select me I pray of you six pairs.\u201d\nHe turned intercepting Rhoda who was following him.",
    "\u201cAs for mademoiselle here I have a little treat for her.",
    "A treat that would be no treat to\nyou I fancy Mademoiselle Meredith.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it\u201d cried Rhoda.",
    "144\n\n\fHe lowered his voice.",
    "\u201cA knife mademoiselle with which twelve people once stabbed a\nman.",
    "It was given me as a souvenir by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits.\u201d\n\u201cHorrible\u201d cried Anne.",
    "\u201cOoh let me see\u201d said Rhoda.",

    "\u201cIt was given me by the\nCompagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits because \u2010\u201d\nThey passed out of the room.",
    "They returned three minutes later.",
    "Anne came toward them.",
    "\u201cI think these six are the\nnicest Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Both these are very good evening shades and this lighter colour\nwould be nice when summer comes and it\u2019s daylight in the evening.\u201d\n\u201cMille remerciments mademoiselle.\u201d\nHe offered them more sirop which they refused and finally accompanied them to the\ndoor still talking genially.",
    "When they had finally departed he returned to the room and\nwent straight to the littered table.",
    "The pile of hose still lay in a confused heap.",
    "Poirot\ncounted the six selected pairs and then went on to count the others.",
    "He had bought nineteen pairs.",

    "\u201cThat\u2019s what Shaitana was aiming at with\nhis \u2018domestic accident\u2019 business.",
    "But what gets me is the motive.",
    "Why did she want to kill\nthe woman\u201d\n\u201cI think I can help you there my friend.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cThis afternoon I conducted a little experiment.",
    "I induced mademoiselle and her friend to\ncome here.",
    "I put to them my usual questions as to what there was in the room that night.\u201d\nBattle looked at him curiously.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re very keen on that question.\u201d\n\u201cYes it\u2019s useful.",
    "It tells me a good deal.",
    "Mademoiselle Meredith was suspicious.",
    "Very\nsuspicious.",
    "She takes nothing for granted that young lady.",
    "So that good dog Hercule\nPoirot he does one of his best tricks.",
    "He lays a clumsy amateurish trap.",
    "Mademoiselle\nmentions a case of jewellery.",
    "I say was not that at the opposite end of the room from the\ntable with the dagger Mademoiselle does not fall into the trap.",
    "She avoids it cleverly.",
    "And\nafter that she is pleased with herself and her vigilance relaxes.",
    "So that is the object of this\nvisit To get her to admit that she knew where the dagger was and that she noticed it Her\nspirits rise when she has as she thinks defeated me.",
    "She talks quite freely about the\njewellery.",
    "She has noticed many details of it.",
    "There is nothing else in the room that she\nremembers \u2010 except that a vase of chrysanthemums needed its water changed.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cWell it is significant that.",
    "Suppose we knew nothing about this girl.",
    "Her words would\ngive us a clue to her character.",
    "She notices flowers \u2010 she is then fond of flowers No since\nshe does not mention a very big bowl of early tulips which would at once have attracted\nthe attention of a flower lover.",
    "No it is the paid companion who speaks \u2010 the girl whose\nduty it has been to put fresh water in the vases \u2010 and allied to that there is a girl who loves\nand notices jewellery.",
    "Is not that at least suggestive\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m beginning to see what you\u2019re driving at.\u201d\n\n147\n\n\f\u201cPrecisely.",
    "As I told you the other day I place my cards on the table.",
    "When you recounted\nher history the other day and Mrs. Oliver made her startling announcement my mind\nwent at once to an important point.",
    "The murder could not have been committed for gain\nsince Miss Meredith had still to earn her living after it happened.",
    "Why then I considered\nMiss Meredith\u2019s temperament as it appeared superficially.",
    "A rather timid young girl poor\nbut well\u2010dressed fond of pretty things.",
    "The temperament is it not of a thief rather than\na murderer And I asked immediately if Mrs. Eldon had been a tidy woman.",
    "You replied\nthat no she had not been tidy.",
    "I formed a hypothesis.",
    "Supposing that Anne Meredith was\na girl with a weak streak in her character \u2010 the kind of girl who takes little things from the\nbig shops.",
    "Supposing that poor and yet loving pretty things she helped herself once or\ntwice to things from her employer.",
    "A brooch perhaps an odd half crown or two a string\nof beads.",
    "Mrs. Eldon careless untidy would put down these disappearances to her own\ncarelessness.",
    "She would not suspect her gentle little mother\u2019s\u2010help.",
    "But now suppose a\ndifferent type of employer \u2010 an employer who did notice \u2010 who accused Anne Meredith of\ntheft.",
    "That would be a possible motive for murder.",
    "As I said the other evening Miss\nMeredith would only commit a murder through fear.",
    "She knows that her employer will be\nable to prove the theft there is only one thing that can save her \u2010 her employer must die.",
    "And so she changes the bottles and Mrs. Benson dies ironically enough convinced that\nthe mistake is her own and not suspecting for a minute that the cowed frightened girl has\nhad a hand in it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s only a hypothesis but it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a little more than possible my friend it is also probable.",
    "For this afternoon I laid a\nlittle trap nicely baited \u2010 the real trap after the sham one had been circumvented.",
    "If what I\nsuspect is true Anne Meredith will never never be able to resist a really expensive pair of\nhose I ask her to aid me.",
    "I let her know carefully that I am not sure exactly how many\nhose there are.",
    "I go out of the room leaving her alone \u2010 and the result my friend is that I\nhave now seventeen pairs of hose instead of nineteen and that two pairs have gone away\nin Anne Meredith\u2019s handbag.\u201d\n\u201cWhew\u201d Superintendent Battle whistled.",
    "\u201cWhat a risk to take though.\u201d\n\u201cPas du tout.",
    "What does she think I suspect her of Murder.",
    "What is the risk then in\nstealing a pair or two pairs of silk hose I am not looking for a thief.",
    "And besides the thief\nor the kleptomaniac is always the same convinced that she can get away with it.\u201d\nBattle nodded his head.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s true enough.",
    "Incredibly stupid.",
    "The pitcher goes to the well time after time.",
    "Well I\nthink between us we\u2019ve arrived fairly clearly at the truth.",
    "Anne Meredith was caught\nstealing.",
    "Anne Meredith changed a bottle from one shelf to another.",
    "We know that was\nmurder but I\u2019m damned if we could ever prove it.",
    "Successful crime number two.",
    "Roberts\ngets away with it.",
    "Anne Meredith gets away with it.",
    "But what about Shaitana Did Anne\nMeredith kill Shaitana\u201d\nHe remained silent for a moment or two then he shook his head.",
    "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work out\nright\u201d he said reluctantly.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s not one to take a risk.",
    "Change a couple of bottles yes.",
    "148\n\n\fShe knew no one could fasten that on her.",
    "It was absolutely safe because anyone might\nhave done it Of course it mightn\u2019t have worked.",
    "Mrs. Benson might have noticed before\nshe drank the stuff or she mightn\u2019t have died from it.",
    "It was what I call a hopeful kind of\nmurder.",
    "It might work or it mightn\u2019t.",
    "Actually it did.",
    "But Shaitana was a very different pair\nof shoes.",
    "That was deliberate audacious purposeful murder.\u201d\nPoirot nodded his head.",
    "\u201cI agree with you.",
    "The two types of crime are not the same.\u201d\nBattle rubbed his nose.",
    "\u201cSo that seems to wipe her out as far as he\u2019s concerned.",
    "Roberts\nand the girl both crossed off our list.",
    "What about Despard Any luck with the Luxmore\nwoman\u201d Poirot narrated his adventures of the preceding afternoon.",
    "Battle grinned.",
    "\u201cI know that type.",
    "You can\u2019t disentangle what they remember from what\nthey invent.\u201d\nPoirot went on.",
    "He described Despard\u2019s visit and the story the latter had told.",
    "\u201cBelieve him\u201d Battle asked abruptly.",
    "\u201cYes I do.\u201d\nBattle sighed.",
    "\u201cSo do I.",
    "Not the type to shoot a man because he wanted the man\u2019s wife.",
    "Anyway what\u2019s wrong with the divorce court Everyone flocks there and he\u2019s not a\nprofessional man it wouldn\u2019t ruin him or anything like that.",
    "No I\u2019m of the opinion that our\nlate lamented Mr. Shaitana struck a snag there.",
    "Murderer number three wasn\u2019t a\nmurderer after all.\u201d\nHe looked at Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat leaves \u2010\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer\u201d said Poirot.",
    "The telephone rang.",
    "Poirot got up and answered it.",
    "He spoke a few words waited spoke\nagain.",
    "Then he hung up the receiver and returned to Battle.",
    "His face was very grave.",
    "\u201cThat was Mrs. Lorrimer speaking\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cShe wants me to come round and see her \u2010\nnow.\u201d\nHe and Battle looked at each other.",
    "The latter shook his head slowly.",
    "\u201cAm I wrong\u201d he\nsaid.",
    "\u201cOr were you expecting something of the kind\u201d\n\u201cI wondered\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat was all.",
    "I wondered.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get along\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll manage to get at the truth at last.\u201d\n149\n\n\f150\n\n\fChapter 25\nMrs. Lorrimer Speaks\nThe day was not a bright one and Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s room seemed rather dark and cheerless.",
    "She herself had a gray look and seemed much older than she had on the occasion of\nPoirot\u2019s last visit.",
    "She greeted him with her usual smiling assurance.",
    "\u201cIt is very nice of you to come so promptly Monsieur Poirot.",
    "You are a busy man I know.\u201d\n\u201cAt your service Madame\u201d said Poirot with a little bow.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer pressed the bell by the fireplace.",
    "\u201cWe will have tea brought in.",
    "I don\u2019t know what you feel about it but I always think it\u2019s a\nmistake to rush straight into confidences without any decent paving of the way.\u201d\n\u201cThere are to be confidences then Madame\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer did not answer for at that moment her maid answered the bell.",
    "When she\nhad received the order and gone again Mrs. Lorrimer said dryly \u201cYou said if you\nremember when you were last here that you would come if I sent for you.",
    "You had an\nidea I think of the reason that should prompt me to send\u201d\nThere was no more just then.",
    "Tea was brought.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer dispensed it talking\nintelligently on various topics of the day.",
    "Taking advantage of a pause Poirot remarked \u201cI hear you and little Mademoiselle\nMeredith had tea together the other day.\u201d\n\u201cWe did.",
    "You have seen her lately\u201d\n\u201cThis very afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cShe is in London then or have you been down to Wallingford\u201d\n\u201cNo she and her friend were so amiable as to pay me a visit.\u201d\n\u201cAh the friend.",
    "I have not met her.\u201d\nPoirot said smiling a little \u201cThis murder \u2010 it has made for a rapprochement.",
    "You and\nMademoiselle Meredith have tea together.",
    "Major Despard he too cultivates Miss\nMeredith\u2019s acquaintance.",
    "The Doctor Roberts he is perhaps the only one out of it.\u201d\n\n151\n\n\f\u201cI saw him out at bridge the other day\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "\u201cHe seemed quite his usual\ncheerful self.\u201d\n\u201cAs fond of bridge as ever\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2010 still making the most outrageous bids \u2010 and very often getting away with it.\u201d\nShe was silent for a moment or two then said \u201cHave you seen Superintendent Battle\nlately\u201d\n\u201cAlso this afternoon.",
    "He was with me when you telephoned.\u201d\nShading her face from the fire with one hand Mrs. Lorrimer asked \u201cHow is he getting\non\u201d\nPoirot said gravely \u201cHe is not very rapid the good Battle.",
    "He gets there slowly but he does\nget there in the end Madame.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder\u201d Her lips curved in a faintly ironical smile.",
    "She went on \u201cHe has paid me quite a lot of attention.",
    "He has delved I think into my past\nhistory right back to my girlhood.",
    "He has interviewed my friends and chatted to my\nservants \u2010 the ones I have now and the ones who have been with me in former years.",
    "What he hoped to find I do not know but he certainly did not find it.",
    "He might as well\nhave accepted what I told him.",
    "It was the truth.",
    "I knew Mr. Shaitana very slightly.",
    "I met\nhim at Luxor as I said and our acquaintanceship was never more than an\nacquaintanceship.",
    "Superintendent Battle will not be able to get away from these facts.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps not\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd you Monsieur Poirot Have not you made any inquiries\u201d\n\u201cAbout you Madame\u201d\n\u201cThat is what I meant.\u201d\nSlowly the little man shook his head.",
    "\u201cIt would have been of no avail.\u201d\n\u201cJust exactly what do you mean by that Monsieur Poirot\u201d\n\u201cI will be quite frank Madame.",
    "I have realized from the beginning that of the four persons\nin Mr. Shaitana\u2019s room that night the one with the best brains with the coolest most\nlogical head was you Madame.",
    "If I had to lay money on the chance of one of those four\nplanning a murder and getting away with it successfully it is on you that I should place my\nmoney.\u201d\n152\n\n\fMrs. Lorrimer\u2019s brows rose.",
    "\u201cAm I expected to feel flattered\u201d she asked dryly.",
    "Poirot went on without paying any attention to her interruption.",
    "\u201cFor a crime to be\nsuccessful it is usually necessary to think every detail of it out beforehand.",
    "All possible\ncontingencies must be taken into account.",
    "The timing must be accurate.",
    "The placing must\nbe scrupulously correct.",
    "Doctor Roberts might bungle a crime through haste and\noverconfidence Major Despard would probably be too prudent to commit one Miss\nMeredith might lose her head and give herself away.",
    "You Madame would do none of\nthese things.",
    "You would be clearheaded and cool you are sufficiently resolute of character\nand could be sufficiently obsessed with an idea to the extent of overruling prudence you\nare not the kind of woman to lose her head.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer sat silent for a minute or two a curious smile playing round her lips.",
    "At last\nshe said \u201cSo that is what you think of me Monsieur Poirot \u2010 that I am the kind of woman\nto commit an ideal murder.\u201d\n\u201cAt least you have the amiability not to resent the idea.\u201d\n\u201cI find it very interesting.",
    "So it is your idea that I am the only person who could\nsuccessfully have murdered Shaitana.\u201d\nPoirot said slowly \u201cThere is a difficulty there Madame.\u201d\n\u201cReally Do tell me.\u201d\n\u201cYou may have noticed that I said just now a phrase something like this For a crime to be\nsuccessful it is usually necessary to plan every detail of it carefully beforehand.",
    "\u2018Usually\u2019 is\nthe word to which I want to draw your attention.",
    "For there is another type of successful\ncrime.",
    "Have you ever said suddenly to anyone \u2018Throw a stone and see if you can hit that\ntree\u2019 and the person obeys quickly without thinking \u2010 and surprisingly often he does hit\nthe tree.",
    "But when he comes to repeat the throw it is not so easy for he has begun to\nthink.",
    "\u2018So hard \u2010 no harder \u2010 a little more to the right \u2010 to the left.\u2019 The first was an almost\nunconscious action the body obeying the mind as the body of an animal does.",
    "Eh bien\nMadame there is a type of crime like that \u2010 a crime committed on the spur of the moment\n\u2010 an inspiration \u2010 a flash of genius \u2010 without time to pause or think.",
    "And that Madame was\nthe kind of crime that killed Mr. Shaitana.",
    "A sudden dire necessity a flash of inspiration\nrapid execution.\u201d\nHe shook his head.",
    "\u201cAnd that Madame is not your type of crime at all.",
    "If you killed Mr.\nShaitana it should have been a premeditated crime.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Her hand waved softly to and fro keeping the heat of the fire from her face.",
    "\u201cAnd\nof course it wasn\u2019t a premeditated crime so I couldn\u2019t have killed him \u2010 eh Monsieur\nPoirot\u201d\nPoirot bowed.",
    "\u201cThat is right Madame.\u201d\n153\n\n\f\u201cAnd yet \u2010\u201d she leaned forward her waving hand stopped \u2010 \u201cI did kill Shaitana Monsieur\nPoirot \u2010\u201d\n\n154\n\n\fChapter 26\nThe Truth\nThere was a pause \u2010 a very long pause.",
    "The room was growing dark.",
    "The firelight leaped\nand flickered.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer and Hercule Poirot looked not at each other but at the fire.",
    "It\nwas as though time was momentarily in abeyance.",
    "Then Hercule Poirot sighed and stirred.",
    "\u201cSo it was that \u2010 all the time.",
    "Why did you kill him Madame\u201d\n\u201cI think you know why Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cBecause he knew something about you Something that had happened long ago\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that something was \u2010 another death Madame\u201d\nShe bowed her head.",
    "Poirot said gently \u201cWhy did you tell me What made you send for me today\u201d\n\u201cYou told me once that I should do so some day.\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2010 that is I hoped \u2010 I knew Madame that there was only one way of learning the truth\nas far as you were concerned and that was by your own free will.",
    "If you did not choose to\nspeak you would not do so and you would never give yourself away.",
    "But there was a\nchance \u2010 that you yourself might wish to speak.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer nodded.",
    "\u201cIt was clever of you to foresee that \u2010 the weariness the loneliness\u2010\n\u201d\nHer voice died away.",
    "Poirot looked at her curiously.",
    "\u201cSo it has been like that Yes I can understand it might be.\u201d\n\u201cAlone \u2010 quite alone\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "\u201cNo one knows what that means unless they\nhave lived as I have lived with the knowledge of what one has done.\u201d\nPoirot said gently.",
    "\u201cIs it an impertinence Madame or may I be permitted to offer my\nsympathy\u201d\nShe bent her head a little.",
    "\u201cThank you Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\n\n155\n\n\fThere was another pause then Poirot said speaking in a slightly brisker tone \u201cAm I to\nunderstand Madame that you took the words Mr. Shaitana spoke at dinner as a direct\nmenace aimed at you\u201d\nShe nodded.",
    "\u201cI realized at once that he was speaking so that one person should\nunderstand him.",
    "That person was myself.",
    "The reference to a woman\u2019s weapon being\npoison was meant for me.",
    "He knew.",
    "I had suspected it once before.",
    "He had brought the\nconversation round to a certain famous trial and I saw his eyes watching me.",
    "There was a\nkind of uncanny knowledge in them.",
    "But of course that night I was quite sure.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you were sure too of his future intentions.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer said dryly \u201cIt was hardly likely that the presence of Superintendent Battle\nand yourself was an accident.",
    "I took it that Shaitana was going to advertise his own\ncleverness by pointing out to you both that he had discovered something that no one else\nhad suspected.\u201d\n\u201cHow soon did you make up your mind to act Madame\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer hesitated a little.",
    "\u201cIt is difficult to remember exactly when the idea came into my mind\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI had\nnoticed the dagger before going in to dinner.",
    "When we returned to the drawing\u2010room I\npicked it up and slipped it into my sleeve.",
    "No one saw me do it.",
    "I made sure of that.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be dextrously done I have no doubt Madame.\u201d\n\u201cI made up my mind then exactly what I was going to do.",
    "I had only to carry it out.",
    "It was\nrisky perhaps but I considered that it was worth trying.\u201d\n\u201cThat is your coolness your successful weighing of chances coming into play.",
    "Yes I see\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cWe started to play bridge\u201d continued Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "Her voice was cool and\nunemotional.",
    "\u201cAt last an opportunity arose.",
    "I was dummy.",
    "I strolled across the room to the\nfireplace.",
    "Shaitana had dozed off to sleep.",
    "I looked over at the others.",
    "They were all intent\non the game.",
    "I leaned over and \u2010 and did it \u2010\u201d\nHer voice shook just a little but instantly it regained its cool aloofness.",
    "\u201cI spoke to him.",
    "It came into my head that that would make a kind of alibi for me I made\nsome remark about the fire and then pretended he had answered me and went on again\nsaying something like \u2018I agree with you.",
    "I do not like radiators either.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe did not cry out at all\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "I think he made a little grunt \u2010 that was all.",
    "It might have been taken for words from a\ndistance.\u201d\n156\n\n\f\u201cAnd then\u201d\n\u201cAnd then I went back to the bridge table.",
    "The last trick was just being played.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you sat down and resumed play\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWith sufficient interest in the game to be able to tell me nearly all the calling and the\nhands two days later.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer simply.",
    "\u201cEpatant\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He leaned back in his chair.",
    "He nodded his head several times.",
    "Then by way of a change\nhe shook it.",
    "\u201cBut there is still something Madame that I do not understand\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to me that there is some factor I have missed.",
    "You are a woman who considers\nand weighs everything carefully.",
    "You decide that for a certain reason you will run an\nenormous risk.",
    "You do run it \u2010 successfully.",
    "And then not two weeks later you change\nyour mind.",
    "Frankly Madame that does not seem to me to ring true.\u201d\nA queer little smile twisted her lips.",
    "\u201cYou are quite right Monsieur Poirot there is one factor that you do not know.",
    "Did Miss\nMeredith tell you where she met me the other day\u201d\n\u201cIt was I think she said near Mrs. Oliver\u2019s flat.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that is so.",
    "But I meant the actual name of the street.",
    "Anne Meredith met me in\nHarley Street\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d He looked at her attentively.",
    "\u201cI begin to see.\u201d\n\u201cYes I thought you would.",
    "I had been to see a specialist there.",
    "He told me what I already\nhalf suspected.\u201d\nHer smile widened.",
    "It was no longer twisted and bitter.",
    "It was suddenly sweet.",
    "\u201cI shall not\nplay very much more bridge Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Oh he didn\u2019t say so in so many words.",
    "He\nwrapped up the truth a little.",
    "With great care et cetera I might live several years.",
    "But I\nshall not take any great care.",
    "I am not that kind of a woman.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes I begin to understand\u201d said Poirot.",
    "157\n\n\f\u201cIt made a difference you see.",
    "A month \u2010 two months perhaps \u2010 not more.",
    "And then just\nas I left the specialist I saw Miss Meredith.",
    "I asked her to have tea with me.\u201d\nShe paused then went on.",
    "\u201cI am not after all a wholly wicked woman.",
    "All the time we\nwere having tea I was thinking.",
    "By my action the other evening I had not only deprived\nthe man Shaitana of life that was done and could not be undone I had also to a varying\ndegree affected unfavourably the lives of three other people.",
    "Because of what I had done\nDoctor Roberts Major Despard and Anne Meredith none of whom had injured me in any\nway were passing through a very grave ordeal and might even be in danger.",
    "That at least\nI could undo.",
    "I don\u2019t know that I felt particularly moved by the plight of either Doctor\nRoberts or Major Despard \u2010 although both of them had presumably a much longer span of\nlife in front of them than I had.",
    "They were men and could to a certain extent look after\nthemselves.",
    "But when I looked at Anne Meredith \u2010\u201d\nShe hesitated then continued slowly \u201cAnne Meredith was only a girl.",
    "She has the whole\nof her life in front of her.",
    "This miserable business might ruin that life.",
    "I didn\u2019t like the\nthought of that.",
    "And then Monsieur Poirot with these ideas growing in my mind I\nrealized that what you had hinted had come true.",
    "I was not going to be able to keep\nsilence.",
    "This afternoon I rang you up \u2010\u201d\nMinutes passed.",
    "Hercule Poirot leaned forward.",
    "He stared deliberately stared through the\ngathering gloom at Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "She returned that intent gaze quietly and without any\nnervousness.",
    "He said at last \u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer.",
    "Are you sure \u2010 are you positive you will tell me the truth\nwill you not that the murder of Mr. Shaitana was not premeditated Is it not a fact that\nyou planned the crime beforehand That you went to that dinner with the murder already\nall mapped out in your mind\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer stared at him for a moment then she shook her head sharply.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d she\nsaid.",
    "\u201cYou did not plan the murder beforehand\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\u201cThen \u2010 then \u2010 Oh you are lying to me \u2010 you must be lying \u2010\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer\u2019s voice cut into the air like ice.",
    "\u201cReally Monsieur Poirot you forget yourself.\u201d\nThe little man sprang to his feet.",
    "He paced up and down the room muttering to himself\nuttering ejaculations.",
    "Suddenly he said \u201cPermit me\u201d And going to the switch he turned\non the electric lights.",
    "He came back sat down in his chair placed both hands on his knees and stared straight at\nhis hostess.",
    "158\n\n\f\u201cThe question is\u201d he said \u201ccan Hercule Poirot possibly be wrong\u201d\n\u201cNo one can always be right\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer coldly.",
    "\u201cI am\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cAlways I am right.",
    "It is so invariable that it startles me.",
    "But now it\nlooks it very much looks as though I am wrong.",
    "And that upsets me.",
    "Presumably you know\nwhat you are saying.",
    "It is your murder Fantastic then that Hercule Poirot should know\nbetter than you do how you committed it.\u201d\n\u201cFantastic and very absurd\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer still more coldly.",
    "\u201cI am then mad.",
    "Decidedly I am mad.",
    "No \u2010 sacr\u00e9 nom d\u2019un petit bonhomme \u2010 I am not\nmad I am right.",
    "I must be right.",
    "I am willing to believe that you killed Mr. Shaitana \u2010 but\nyou cannot have killed him in the way you say you did.",
    "No one can do a thing that is not\ndans son caract\u00e8re\u201d\nHe paused.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer drew in an angry breath and bit her lips.",
    "She was about to\nspeak but Poirot forestalled her.",
    "\u201cEither the killing of Shaitana was planned beforehand \u2010\nor you did not kill him at all\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer said sharply \u201cI really believe you are mad Monsieur Poirot.",
    "If I am willing to\nadmit I committed the crime I should not be likely to lie about the way I did it.",
    "What\nwould be the point of such a thing\u201d\nPoirot got up again and took one turn round the room.",
    "When he came back to his seat his\nmanner had changed.",
    "He was gentle and kindly.",
    "\u201cYou did not kill Shaitana\u201d he said softly.",
    "\u201cI see that now.",
    "I see everything.",
    "Harley Street.",
    "And little Anne Meredith standing forlorn on the pavement.",
    "I see too another girl \u2010 a very\nlong time ago.",
    "A girl who has gone through life always alone terribly alone.",
    "Yes I see all\nthat.",
    "But one thing I do not see \u2010 why are you so certain that Anne Meredith did it\u201d\n\u201cReally Monsieur Poirot \u2010\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely useless to protest to lie further to me Madame.",
    "I tell you I know the truth.",
    "I\nknow the very emotions that swept over you that day in Harley Street.",
    "You would not\nhave done it for Doctor Roberts \u2010 oh no You would not have done it for Major Despard\nnon plus.",
    "But Anne Meredith is different.",
    "You have compassion for her because she has\ndone what you once did.",
    "You do not know even \u2010 or so I imagine \u2010 what reason she had for\nthe crime.",
    "But you are quite sure she did it.",
    "You were sure that first evening the evening it\nhappened when Superintendent Battle invited you to give your views on the case.",
    "Yes I\nknow it all you see.",
    "It is quite useless to lie further to me.",
    "You see that do you not\u201d He\npaused for an answer but none came.",
    "He nodded his head in satisfaction.",
    "\u201cYes you are sensible.",
    "That is good.",
    "It is a very noble action that you perform there\nMadame to take the blame on yourself and to let this child escape.\u201d\n\n159\n\n\f\u201cYou forget\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer in a dry voice.",
    "\u201cI am not an innocent woman.",
    "Years ago\nMonsieur Poirot I killed my husband.\u201d\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence.",
    "\u201cI see\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt is justice.",
    "After all only justice.",
    "You have the logical mind.",
    "You are\nwilling to suffer for the act you committed.",
    "Murder is murder \u2010 it does not matter who the\nvictim is.",
    "Madame you have courage and you have clear\u2010sightedness.",
    "But I ask of you\nonce more How can you be so sure How do you know that it was Anne Meredith who\nkilled Mr. Shaitana\u201d\nA deep sigh broke from Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "Her last resistance had gone down before Poirot\u2019s\ninsistence.",
    "She answered his question quite simply like a child.",
    "\u201cBecause\u201d she said \u201cI saw her.\u201d\n\n160\n\n\fChapter 27\nThe Eyewitness\nSuddenly Poirot laughed.",
    "He could not help it.",
    "His head went back and his high Gallic laugh\nfilled the room.",
    "\u201cPardon Madame\u201d he said wiping his eyes.",
    "\u201cI could not help it.",
    "Here we\nargue and we reason We ask questions We invoke the psychology \u2010 and all the time\nthere was an eyewitness of the crime.",
    "Tell me I pray of you.\u201d\n\u201cIt was fairly late in the evening.",
    "Anne Meredith was dummy.",
    "She got up and looked over\nher partner\u2019s hand and then she moved about the room.",
    "The hand wasn\u2019t very interesting\n\u2010 the conclusion was inevitable.",
    "I didn\u2019t need to concentrate on the cards.",
    "Just as we got to\nthe last three tricks I looked over toward the fireplace.",
    "Anne Meredith was bent over Mr.\nShaitana.",
    "As I watched she straightened herself \u2010 her hand had been actually on his breast\n\u2010 a gesture which awakened my surprise.",
    "She straightened herself and I saw her face and\nher quick look over toward us.",
    "Guilt and fear \u2010 that is what I saw on her face.",
    "Of course I\ndidn\u2019t know what had happened then.",
    "I only wondered what on earth the girl could have\nbeen doing.",
    "Later \u2010 I knew.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cBut she did not know that you knew.",
    "She did not know that you had seen\nher\u201d\n\u201cPoor child\u201d said Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "\u201cYoung frightened \u2010 her way to make in the world.",
    "Do\nyou wonder that I \u2010 well held my tongue\u201d\n\u201cNo no I do not wonder.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially knowing that I \u2010 that I myself \u2010\u201d She finished the sentence with a shrug.",
    "\u201cIt was\ncertainly not my place to stand accuser.",
    "It was up to the police.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so but today you have gone further than that.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer said grimly \u201cI\u2019ve never been a very soft\u2010hearted or compassionate woman\nbut I suppose these qualities grow upon one in one\u2019s old age.",
    "I assure you I\u2019m not often\nactuated by pity.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not always a very safe guide Madame.",
    "Mademoiselle Anne is young she is fragile\nshe looks timid and frightened \u2010 oh yes she seems a very worthy subject for compassion.",
    "But I I do not agree.",
    "Shall I tell you Madame why Miss Anne Meredith killed Mr.\nShaitana It was because he knew that she had previously killed an elderly lady to whom\nshe was companion \u2010 because that lady had found her out in a petty theft.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer looked a little startled.",
    "\u201cIs that true Monsieur Poirot\u201d\n\u201cI have no doubt of it whatsoever.",
    "She is so soft \u2010 so gentle \u2010 one would say.",
    "Pah she is\ndangerous Madame that little Mademoiselle Anne Where her own safety her own\n161\n\n\fcomfort is concerned she will strike wildly treacherously.",
    "With Mademoiselle Anne those\ntwo crimes will not be the end.",
    "She will gain confidence from them.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer said sharply \u201cWhat you say is horrible Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Horrible\u201d\nPoirot rose.",
    "\u201cMadame I will now take my leave.",
    "Reflect on what I have said.\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer was looking a little uncertain of herself.",
    "She said with an attempt at her old\nmanner \u201cIf it suits me Monsieur Poirot I shall deny this whole conversation.",
    "You have no\nwitnesses remember.",
    "What I have just told you that I saw on that fatal evening is \u2010 well\nprivate between ourselves.\u201d\nPoirot said gravely \u201cNothing shall be done without your consent Madame.",
    "And be at\npeace I have my own methods.",
    "Now that I know what I am driving at \u2010\u201d\nHe took her hand and raised it to his lips.",
    "\u201cPermit me to tell you Madame that you are a most remarkable woman.",
    "All my homage\nand respects.",
    "Yes indeed a woman in a thousand.",
    "Why you have not even done what\nnine hundred and ninety\u2010nine women out of a thousand could not have resisted doing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d\n\u201cTold me just why you killed your husband \u2010 and how entirely justified such a proceeding\nreally was\u201d\nMrs. Lorrimer drew herself up.",
    "\u201cReally Monsieur Poirot\u201d she said stiffly \u201cmy reasons were entirely my own business.\u201d\n\u201cMagnifique\u201d said Poirot and once more raising her hand to his lips he left the room.",
    "It was cold outside the house and he looked up and down for a taxi but there was none in\nsight.",
    "He began to walk in the direction of Kings Road.",
    "As he walked he was thinking hard.",
    "Occasionally he nodded his head once he shook it.",
    "He looked back over his shoulder.",
    "Someone was going up the steps of Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s\nhouse.",
    "In figure it looked very like Anne Meredlth.",
    "He hesitated for a minute wondering\nwhether to turn back or not but in the end he went on.",
    "On arrival at home he found that Battle had gone without leaving any message.",
    "He\nproceeded to ring the superintendent up.",
    "\u201cHullo.\u201d Battle\u2019s voice came through.",
    "\u201cGot anything\u201d\n\u201cJe crois bien.",
    "Mon ami we must get after the Meredith girl \u2010 and quickly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting after her \u2010 but why quickly\u201d\n162\n\n\f\u201cBecause my friend she may be dangerous.\u201d\nBattle was silent for a minute or two.",
    "Then he said \u201cI know what you mean.",
    "But there\u2019s no\none \u2010 Oh well we mustn\u2019t take chances.",
    "As a matter of fact I\u2019ve written her.",
    "Official note\nsaying I\u2019m calling to see her tomorrow.",
    "I thought it might be a good thing to get her\nrattled.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a possibility at least.",
    "I may accompany you\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.",
    "Honoured to have your company Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\nPoirot hung up the receiver with a thoughtful face.",
    "His mind was not quite at rest.",
    "He sat for a long time in front of his fire frowning to\nhimself.",
    "At last putting his fears and doubts aside he went to bed.",
    "\u201cWe will see in the morning\u201d he murmured.",
    "But of what the morning would bring he had no idea.",
    "163\n\n\f164\n\n\fChapter 28\nSuicide\nThe summons came by telephone at the moment when Poirot was sitting down to his\nmorning coffee and rolls.",
    "He lifted the telephone receiver and Battle\u2019s voice spoke.",
    "\u201cThat\nMonsieur Poirot\u201d\n\u201cYes it is I. Qu\u2019est ce qu\u2019il y a\u201d\nThe mere inflection of the superintendent\u2019s voice had told him that something had\nhappened.",
    "His own vague misgivings came back to him.",
    "\u201cBut quickly my friend tell me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Lorrimer.\u201d\n\u201cLorrimer \u2010 yes\u201d\n\u201cWhat the devil did you say to her \u2010 or did she say to you yesterday You never told me\nanything in fact you let me think that the Meredith girl was the one we were after.\u201d\nPoirot said quietly \u201cWhat has happened\u201d\n\u201cSuicide.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer has committed suicide\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.",
    "It seems she has been very depressed and unlike herself lately.",
    "Her doctor\nhad ordered her some sleeping stuff.",
    "Last night she took an overdose.\u201d\nPoirot drew a deep breath.",
    "\u201cThere is no question of \u2010 accident\u201d\n\u201cNot the least.",
    "It\u2019s all cut and dried.",
    "She wrote to the three of them.\u201d\n\u201cWhich three\u201d\n\u201cThe other three.",
    "Roberts Despard and Miss Meredith.",
    "All fair and square no beating\nabout the bush.",
    "Just wrote that she would like them to know that she was taking a short\ncut out of all the mess \u2010 that it was she who had killed Shaitana and that she apologized \u2010\napologized \u2010 to all three of them for the inconvenience and annoyance they had suffered.",
    "Perfectly calm businesslike letter.",
    "Absolutely typical of the woman.",
    "She was a cool\ncustomer all right.\u201d\nFor a minute or two Poirot did not answer.",
    "165\n\n\fSo this was Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s final word.",
    "She had determined after all to shield Anne\nMeredith.",
    "A quick painless death instead of a protracted painful one and her last action\nan altruistic one \u2010 the saving of the girl with whom she felt a secret bond of sympathy.",
    "The\nwhole thing planned and carried out with quiet ruthless efficiency \u2010 a suicide carefully\nannounced to the three interested parties.",
    "What a woman His admiration quickened.",
    "It\nwas like her like her clear\u2010cut determination her insistence on what she had decided\nbeing carried out.",
    "He had thought to have convinced her \u2010 but evidently she had preferred her own\njudgment.",
    "A woman of very strong will.",
    "Battle\u2019s voice cut into his meditations.",
    "\u201cWhat the devil did you say to her yesterday You must have put the wind up her and this\nis the result.",
    "But you implied that the result of your interview was definite suspicion of the\nMeredith girl.\u201d\nPoirot was silent a minute or two.",
    "He felt that dead Mrs. Lorrimer constrained him to her\nwill as she could not have done if she were living.",
    "He said at last slowly \u201cI was in error.\u201d\nThey were unaccustomed words on his tongue and he did not like them.",
    "\u201cYou made a mistake eh\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cAll the same she must have thought you were on\nto her.",
    "It\u2019s a bad business letting her slip through our fingers like this.\u201d\n\u201cYou could not have proved anything against her\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cNo I suppose that\u2019s true.",
    "Perhaps it\u2019s all for the best.",
    "You \u2010 er \u2010 didn\u2019t mean this to\nhappen Monsieur Poirot\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s disclaimer was indignant.",
    "Then he said \u201cTell me exactly what has occurred.\u201d\n\u201cRoberts opened his letters just before eight o\u2019clock.",
    "He lost no time dashed off at once in\nhis car leaving his parlour\u2010maid to communicate with us which she did.",
    "He got to the\nhouse to find that Mrs. Lorrimer hadn\u2019t been called yet \u2010 rushed up to her bedroom but it\nwas too late.",
    "He tried artificial respiration but there was nothing doing.",
    "Our divisional\nsurgeon arrived soon after and confirmed his treatment.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the sleeping stuff\u201d\n\u201cVeronal I think.",
    "One of the Barbitonum series at any rate.",
    "There was a bottle of tablets\nby her bed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the other two Did they not try to communicate with you\u201d\n\u201cDespard is out of town.",
    "He hasn\u2019t had this morning\u2019s post.\u201d\n\u201cAnd \u2010 Miss Meredith.\u201d\n166\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019ve just rung her up.\u201d\n\u201cEh bien\u201d\n\u201cShe had just opened the letter a few moments before my call came through.",
    "Post is later\nthere.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was her reaction\u201d\n\u201cA perfectly proper attitude.",
    "Intense relief decently veiled.",
    "Shocked and grieved \u2010 that sort\nof thing.\u201d\nPoirot paused a moment then he said \u201cWhere are you now my friend\u201d\n\u201cAt Cheyne Lane.\u201d\n\u201cBien.",
    "I will come round immediately.\u201d\nIn the hall at Cheyne Lane he found Doctor Roberts on the point of departure.",
    "The\ndoctor\u2019s usual florid manner was rather in abeyance this morning.",
    "He looked pale and\nshaken.",
    "\u201cNasty business this Monsieur Poirot.",
    "I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not relieved \u2010 from my own point of\nview \u2010 but to tell you the truth it\u2019s a bit of a shock.",
    "I never really thought for a minute that\nit was Mrs. Lorrimer who stabbed Shaitana.",
    "It\u2019s been the greatest surprise to me.\u201d\n\u201cI too am surprised.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet well\u2010bred self\u2010contained woman.",
    "Can\u2019t imagine her doing a violent thing like that.",
    "What was the motive I wonder Oh well we shall never know now.",
    "I confess I\u2019m curious\nthough.\u201d\n\u201cIt must take a load off your mind \u2010 this occurrence.\u201d\n\u201cOh it does undoubtedly.",
    "It would be hypocrisy not to admit it.",
    "It\u2019s not very pleasant to\nhave a suspicion of murder hanging over you.",
    "As for the poor woman herself \u2010 well it was\nundoubtedly the best way out.\u201d\n\u201cSo she thought herself.\u201d\nRoberts nodded.",
    "\u201cConscience I suppose\u201d he said as he let himself out of the house.",
    "Poirot shook his head thoughtfully.",
    "The doctor had misread the situation.",
    "It was not\nremorse that had made Mrs. Lorrimer take her life.",
    "On his way upstairs he paused to say a few words of comfort to the elderly parlour\u2010maid\nwho was weeping quietly.",
    "167\n\n\f\u201cIts so dreadful sir.",
    "So very dreadful.",
    "We were all so fond of her.",
    "And you having tea with\nher yesterday so nice and quiet.",
    "And now today she\u2019s gone.",
    "I shall never forget this\nmorning \u2010 never as long as I live.",
    "The gentleman pealing at the bell.",
    "Rang three times he\ndid before I could get to it.",
    "And \u2018Where\u2019s your mistress\u2019 he shot out at me.",
    "I was so\nflustered I couldn\u2019t hardly answer.",
    "You see we never went in to the mistress till she rang \u2010\nthat was her orders.",
    "And I just couldn\u2019t get out anything.",
    "And the doctor he says\n\u2018Where\u2019s her room\u2019 and ran up the stairs and me behind him and I showed him the door\nand he rushes in not so much as knocking and takes one look at her lying there and \u2018Too\nlate\u2019 he said.",
    "She was dead sir.",
    "But he sent me for brandy and hot water and he tried\ndesperate to bring her back but it couldn\u2019t be done.",
    "And then the police coming and all \u2010 it\nisn\u2019t \u2010 it isn\u2019t \u2010 decent sir.",
    "Mrs. Lorrimer wouldn\u2019t have liked it.",
    "And why the police It\u2019s\nnone of their business surely even if an accident has occurred and the poor mistress did\ntake an overdose by mistake.\u201d\nPoirot did not reply to her question.",
    "He said \u201cLast night was your mistress quite as usual\nDid she seem upset or worried at all\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so sir.",
    "She was tired \u2010 and I think she was in pain.",
    "She hasn\u2019t been well\nlately sir.\u201d\n\u201cNo I know.\u201d\nThe sympathy in his tone made the woman go on.",
    "\u201cShe was never one for complaining sir but both cook and I had been worried about her\nfor some time.",
    "She couldn\u2019t do as much as she used to do and things tired her.",
    "I think\nperhaps the young lady coming after you left was a bit too much for her.\u201d\nWith his foot on the stairs Poirot turned back.",
    "\u201cThe young lady Did a young lady come here yesterday evening\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "Just after you left it was.",
    "Miss Meredith her name was.\u201d\n\u201cDid she stay long\u201d\n\u201cAbout an hour sir.\u201d\nPoirot was silent for a minute or two then he said \u201cAnd afterward\u201d\n\u201cThe mistress went to bed.",
    "She had dinner in bed.",
    "She said she was tired.\u201d\nAgain Poirot was silent then he said \u201cDo you know if your mistress wrote any letters\nyesterday evening\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean after she went to bed I don\u2019t think so sir.\u201d\n\u201cBut you are not sure\u201d\n168\n\n\f\u201cThere were some letters on the hall table ready to be posted sir.",
    "We always took them\nlast thing before shutting up.",
    "But I think they had been lying there since earlier in the day.\u201d\n\u201cHow many were there\u201d\n\u201cTwo or three \u2010 I\u2019m not quite sure sir.",
    "Three I think.\u201d\n\u201cYou \u2010 or cook \u2010 whoever posted them \u2010 did not happen to notice to whom they were\naddressed Do not be offended at my question.",
    "It is of the utmost importance.\u201d\n\u201cI went to the post myself with them sir.",
    "I noticed the top one it was to Fortnum and\nMason\u2019s.",
    "I couldn\u2019t say as to the others.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s tone was earnest and sincere.",
    "\u201cAre you sure there were not more than three letters\u201d\n\u201cYes sir I\u2019m quite certain of that.\u201d\nPoirot nodded his head gravely.",
    "Once more he started up the staircase.",
    "Then he said \u201cYou\nknew I take it that your mistress took medicine to make her sleep\u201d\n\u201cOh yes sir it was the doctor\u2019s orders.",
    "Doctor Lang.\u201d\n\u201cWhere was the sleeping medicine kept\u201d\n\u201cIn the little cupboard in the mistress\u2019s room.\u201d\nPoirot did not ask any further questions.",
    "He went upstairs.",
    "His face was very grave.",
    "On the upper landing Battle greeted him.",
    "The superintendent looked worried and\nharassed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Let me introduce you to Doctor Davidson.\u201d\nThe divisional surgeon shook hands.",
    "He was a tall melancholy man.",
    "\u201cThe luck was against us\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAn hour or two earlier and we might have saved her.\u201d\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cI mustn\u2019t say so officially but I\u2019m not sorry.",
    "She was a \u2010 well she was a\nlady.",
    "I don\u2019t know what her reasons were for killing Shaitana but she may just conceivably\nhave been justified.\u201d\n\u201cIn any case\u201d said Poirot \u201cit is doubtful if she would have lived to stand her trial.",
    "She was\na very ill woman.\u201d\nThe surgeon nodded in agreement.",
    "169\n\n\f\u201cI should say you were quite right.",
    "Well perhaps it is all for the best.\u201d\nHe started down the stairs.",
    "Battle moved after him.",
    "\u201cOne minute Doctor.\u201d\nPoirot his hand on the bedroom door murmured \u201cI may enter \u2010 yes\u201d\nBattle nodded over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cQuite all right.",
    "We\u2019re through.\u201d Poirot passed into the\nroom closing the door behind him.",
    "He went over to the bed and stood looking down at the quiet dead face.",
    "He was very\ndisturbed.",
    "Had the dead woman gone to the grave in a last determined effort to save a\nyoung girl from death and disgrace \u2010 or was there a different a more sinister explanation\nThere were certain facts.",
    "Suddenly he bent down examining a dark discoloured bruise on the dead woman\u2019s arm.",
    "He straightened himself up again.",
    "There was a strange catlike gleam in his eyes that\ncertain close associates of his would have recognized.",
    "He left the room quickly and went\ndownstairs.",
    "Battle and a subordinate were at the telephone.",
    "The latter laid down the\nreceiver and said \u201cHe hasn\u2019t come back sir.\u201d\nBattle said \u201cDespard.",
    "I\u2019ve been trying to get him.",
    "There\u2019s a letter for him with the Chelsea\npostmark all right.\u201d\nPoirot asked an irrelevant question.",
    "\u201cHad Doctor Roberts had his breakfast when he came\nhere\u201d\nBattle stared.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said \u201cI remember he mentioned that he\u2019d come out without it.\u201d\n\u201cThen he will be at his house now.",
    "We can get him.\u201d\n\u201cBut why\u201d\nBut Poirot was already busy at the dial.",
    "Then he spoke.",
    "\u201cDoctor Roberts It is Doctor Roberts speaking Mais oui it is Poirot here.",
    "Just one\nquestion.",
    "Are you well acquainted with the handwriting of Mrs. Lorrimer\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer\u2019s handwriting I \u2010 no I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d ever seen it before.\u201d\n\u201cJe vous remercie.\u201d\nPoirot laid down the receiver quickly.",
    "Battle was staring at him.",
    "170\n\n\f\u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea Monsieur Poirot\u201d he asked quietly.",
    "Poirot took him by the arm.",
    "\u201cListen my friend.",
    "A few minutes after I left this house yesterday Anne Meredith arrived.",
    "I\nactually saw her going up the steps though I was not quite sure of her identity at the time.",
    "Immediately after Anne Meredith left Mrs. Lorrimer went to bed.",
    "As far as the maid\nknows she did not write any letters then and for reasons which you will understand\nwhen I recount to you our interview I do not believe that she wrote those three letters\nbefore my visit.",
    "When did she write them then\u201d\n\u201cAfter the servants had gone to bed\u201d suggested Battle.",
    "\u201cThat is possible yes but there is another possibility \u2010 that she did not write them at all.\u201d\nBattle whistled.",
    "\u201cMy God you mean \u2010\u201d\nThe telephone trilled.",
    "The sergeant picked up the receiver.",
    "He listened a minute then\nturned to Battle.",
    "\u201cSergeant O\u2019Connor speaking from Despard\u2019s flat sir.",
    "There\u2019s reason to believe that\nDespard\u2019s down at Wallingford\u2010on\u2010Thames.\u201d\nPoirot caught Battle by the arm.",
    "\u201cQuickly my friend.",
    "We too must go to Wallingford.",
    "I tell\nyou I am not easy in my mind.",
    "This may not be the end.",
    "I tell you again my friend this\nyoung lady she is dangerous.\u201d\n\n171\n\n\f172\n\n\fChapter 29\nAccident\n\u201cAnne\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cMmm\u201d\n\u201cNo really Anne don\u2019t answer with half your mind on a crossword puzzle.",
    "I want you to\nattend to me.\u201d\n\u201cI am attending.\u201d\nAnne sat bolt upright and put down the paper.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s better.",
    "Look here Anne.\u201d Rhoda hesitated.",
    "\u201cAbout this man coming.\u201d\n\u201cSuperintendent Battle\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Anne I wish you\u2019d tell him \u2010 about being at the Bensons\u2019.\u201d\nAnne\u2019s voice grew rather cold.",
    "\u201cNonsense why should I\u201d\n\u201cBecause \u2010 well it might look as though you\u2019d been keeping something back.",
    "I\u2019m sure it\nwould be better to mention it.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t very well now\u201d said Anne coldly.",
    "\u201cI wish you had in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s too late to bother about that now.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Rhoda did not sound convinced.",
    "Anne said rather irritably \u201cIn any case I can\u2019t see why.",
    "It\u2019s got nothing to do with all this.\u201d\n\u201cNo of course not.\u201d\n\u201cI was only there about two months.",
    "He only wants these things as \u2010 well \u2010 references.",
    "Two\nmonths doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\u201cNo I know.",
    "I expect I\u2019m being foolish but it does worry me rather.",
    "I feel you ought to\nmention it.",
    "You see if it came out some other way it might look rather bad \u2010 your keeping\ndark about it I mean.\u201d\n\n173\n\n\f\u201cI don\u2019t see how it can come out.",
    "Nobody knows but you.\u201d\n\u201cN\u2010No\u201d\nAnne pounced on the slight hesitation in Rhoda\u2019s voice.",
    "\u201cWhy who does know\u201d\n\u201cWell everyone at Combeacre\u201d said Rhoda after a moment\u2019s pause.",
    "\u201cOh that\u201d Anne dismissed it with a shrug.",
    "\u201cThe superintendent isn\u2019t likely to come up\nagainst anyone from there.",
    "It would be an extraordinary coincidence if he did.\u201d\n\u201cCoincidences happen.\u201d\n\u201cRhoda you\u2019re being extraordinary about this.",
    "Fuss fuss fuss.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry darling.",
    "Only you know what the police might be like if they thought\nyou were \u2010 well \u2010 hiding things.\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t know.",
    "Who\u2019s to tell them Nobody knows but you.\u201d\nIt was the second time she had said those words.",
    "At this second repetition her voice\nchanged a little \u2010 something queer and speculative came into it.",
    "\u201cOh dear I wish you would\u201d sighed Rhoda unhappily.",
    "She looked guiltily at Anne but\nAnne was not looking at her.",
    "She was sitting with a frown on her face as though working\nout some calculation.",
    "\u201cRather fun Major Despard turning up\u201d said Rhoda.",
    "\u201cWhat Oh yes.\u201d\n\u201cAnne he is attractive.",
    "If you don\u2019t want him do do do hand him over to me\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd Rhoda.",
    "He doesn\u2019t care tuppence for me.\u201d\n\u201cThen why does he keep on turning up Of course he\u2019s keen on you.",
    "You\u2019re just the sort\nof distressed damsel that he\u2019d enjoy rescuing.",
    "You look so beautifully helpless Anne.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s equally pleasant to both of us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s only his niceness.",
    "But if you don\u2019t want him I could do the sympathetic friend act \u2010\nconsole his broken heart and in the end I might get him who knows\u201d Rhoda concluded\ninelegantly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re quite welcome to him my dear\u201d said Anne laughing.",
    "174\n\n\f\u201cHe\u2019s got such a lovely back to his neck\u201d sighed Rhoda.",
    "\u201cVery brick red and muscular.\u201d\n\u201cDarling must you be so mawkish\u201d\n\u201cDo you like him Anne\u201d\n\u201cYes very much.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t we prim and sedate I think he likes me a little \u2010 not as much as you but a little.\u201d\n\u201cOh but he does like you\u201d said Anne.",
    "Again there was an unusual note in her voice but Rhoda did not hear it.",
    "\u201cWhat time is our sleuth coming\u201d she asked.",
    "\u201cTwelve\u201d said Anne.",
    "She was silent for a minute or two then she said \u201cIt\u2019s only half\u2010past\nten now.",

    "\u201cCome\non then.\u201d\nShe went out of the room and through the garden door.",
    "Anne followed her.",
    "Major Despard called at Wendon Cottage about ten minutes later.",
    "He was before his time\nhe knew so was a little surprised to find both girls had already gone out.",
    "He went through\nthe garden and across the fields and turned to the right along the towpath.",
    "Mrs. Astwell remained a minute or two looking after him instead of getting on with her\nmorning chores.",
    "\u201cSweet on one or other of \u2018em he is\u201d she observed to herself.",
    "\u201cI think it\u2019s Miss Anne but\nI\u2019m not certain.",

    "Treats \u2018em both alike.",
    "I\u2019m not sure\nthey ain\u2019t both sweet on him too.",
    "If so they won\u2019t be such dear friends so much longer.",
    "Nothing like a gentleman for coming between two young ladies.\u201d\nPleasurably excited by the prospect of assisting at a budding romance Mrs. Astwell turned\nindoors to her task of washing up the breakfast things when once again the doorbell rang.",
    "\u201cDrat that door\u201d said Mrs. Astwell.",
    "\u201cDo it on purpose they do.",
    "Parcel I suppose.",
    "Or might\nbe a telegram.\u201d She moved slowly to the front door.",
    "175\n\n\fTwo gentlemen stood there a small foreign gentleman and an exceedingly English big\nburly gentleman.",
    "The latter she had seen before she remembered.",
    "\u201cMiss Meredith at home\u201d asked the big man.",
    "Mrs. Astwell shook her head.",
    "\u201cJust gone out.\u201d\n\u201cReally Which way We didn\u2019t meet her.\u201d\nMrs. Astwell secretly studying the amazing moustache of the other gentleman and\ndeciding that they looked an unlikely pair to be friends volunteered further information.",
    "\u201cGone out on the river\u201d she explained.",
    "The other gentleman broke in.",
    "\u201cAnd the other lady Miss Dawes\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve both gone.\u201d\n\u201cAh thank you\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cLet me see which way does one get to the river\u201d\n\u201cFirst turning to the left down the lane\u201d Mrs. Astwell replied promptly.",
    "\u201cWhen you get to\nthe towpath go right.",
    "I heard them say that\u2019s the way they were going\u201d she added\nhelpfully.",
    "\u201cNot above a quarter of an hour ago.",
    "You\u2019ll soon catch \u2018em up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I wonder\u201d she added to herself as she unwillingly closed the front door having\nstared inquisitively at their retreating backs \u201cwho you two may be.",
    "Can\u2019t place you\nsomehow.\u201d Mrs. Astwell returned to the kitchen sink and Battle and Poirot duly took the\nfirst turning to the left \u2010 a straggling lane which soon ended abruptly at the towpath.",
    "Poirot was hurrying along and Battle eyed him curiously.",
    "\u201cAnything the matter Monsieur\nPoirot You seem in a mighty hurry.\u201d\n\u201cIt is true.",
    "I am uneasy my friend.\u201d\n\u201cAnything particular\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "But there are possibilities.",
    "You never know.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve something in your head\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cYou were urgent that we should come\ndown here this morning without losing a moment \u2010 and my word you made Constable\nTurner step on the gas What are you afraid of The girl\u2019s shot her bolt.\u201d\n176\n\n\fPoirot was silent.",
    "\u201cWhat are you afraid of\u201d Battle repeated.",
    "\u201cWhat is one always afraid of in these cases\u201d\nBattle nodded.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re quite right.",
    "I wonder \u2010\u201d\n\u201cYou wonder what my friend\u201d\nBattle said slowly \u201cI\u2019m wondering if Miss Meredith knows that her friend told Mrs. Oliver\na certain fact.\u201d\nPoirot nodded his head in vigorous appreciation.",
    "\u201cHurry my friend\u201d he said.",
    "They hastened along the riverbank.",
    "There was no craft visible on the water\u2019s surface but\npresently they rounded a bend and Poirot suddenly stopped dead.",
    "Battle\u2019s quick eyes saw\nalso.",
    "\u201cMajor Despard\u201d he said.",
    "Despard was about two hundred yards ahead of them striding along the riverbank.",
    "A little\nfurther on the two girls were in view in a punt on the water Rhoda punting Anne lying\nand laughing up at her.",
    "Neither of them was looking toward the bank.",
    "And then \u2010 it happened Anne\u2019s hand outstretched Rhoda\u2019s stagger her plunge overboard\n\u2010 her desperate grasp at Anne\u2019s sleeve \u2010 the rocking boat \u2010 then an overturned punt and\ntwo girls struggling in the water.",
    "\u201cSee it\u201d cried Battle as he started to run.",
    "\u201cLittle Meredith caught her round the ankle and\ntipped her in.",
    "My God that\u2019s her fourth murder\u201d\nThey were both running hard but someone was ahead of them.",
    "It was clear that neither\ngirl could swim but Despard had run quickly along the path to the nearest point and now\nhe plunged in and swam toward them.",
    "\u201cMon Dieu this is interesting\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "He caught at Battle\u2019s arm.",
    "\u201cWhich of them will\nhe go for first\u201d\nThe two girls were not together.",
    "About twelve yards separated them.",
    "Despard swam powerfully toward them there was no check in his stroke.",
    "He was making\nstraight for Rhoda.",
    "Battle in his turn reached the nearest bank and went in.",
    "Despard had just brought Rhoda\nsuccessfully to shore.",
    "He hauled her up.",
    "Hung her down and plunged in again swimming\ntoward the spot where Anne had just gone under.",

    "She said slowly \u201cYou saved me.",
    "You saved me \u2010\u201d She held out her hands to him and as he\ntook them she burst suddenly into tears.",
    "He said \u201cRhoda \u2010\u201d Their hands clung together.",

    "Anne Why should she\u201d\n\u201cShe had her reasons\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cBut the point is Miss Dawes that as\nfar as Miss Meredith knew you were the only person who could give us a clue to that\nincident.",
    "You didn\u2019t tell her I suppose that you\u2019d mentioned it to Mrs. Oliver\u201d\nRhoda said slowly \u201cNo.",

    "The murderer of Mr. Shaitana is found at last.\u201d\n\u201cSo Mrs. Oliver told me.",
    "That pretty little thing Anne Meredith.",
    "I can hardly believe it.",
    "A\nmost unbelievable murderess.\u201d\n\u201cShe was a murderess all right\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cThree murders to her credit \u2010 and not her\nfault that she didn\u2019t get away with a fourth one.\u201d\n\u201cIncredible\u201d murmured Roberts.",
    "\u201cNot at all\u201d said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "\u201cLeast likely person.",
    "It seems to work out in real life just the\nsame as in books.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing day\u201d said Roberts.",
    "\u201cFirst Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s letter \u2010 I suppose that was\na forgery eh\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely.",
    "A forgery written in triplicate.\u201d\n\u201cShe wrote one to herself too\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.",
    "The forgery was quite skilful \u2010 it would not deceive an expert of course but\nthen it was highly unlikely that an expert would have been called in.",
    "All the evidence\npointed to Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s having committed suicide.\u201d\n\u201cYou will excuse my curiosity Monsieur Poirot but what made you suspect that she had\nnot committed suicide\u201d\n\u201cA little conversation that I had with a maidservant at Cheyne Lane.\u201d\n\u201cShe told you of Anne Meredith\u2019s visit the former evening\u201d\n\u201cThat among other things.",
    "And then you see I had already come to a conclusion in my\nown mind as to the identity of the guilty person \u2010 that is the person who killed Mr.\nShaitana.",
    "That person was not Mrs. Lorrimer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat made you suspect Miss Meredith\u201d\n180\n\n\fPoirot raised his hand.",
    "\u201cA little minute.",
    "Let me approach this matter in my own way.",
    "Let\nme that is to say eliminate.",
    "The murderer of Mr. Shaitana was not Mrs. Lorrimer nor was\nit Major Despard and curiously enough it was not Anne Meredith \u2010\u201d\nHe leaned forward.",
    "His voice purred soft and catlike.",
    "\u201cYou see Doctor Roberts you were the person who killed Mr. Shaitana and you also killed\nMrs. Lorrimer \u2010\u201d\nThere was at least three minutes\u2019 silence.",
    "Then Roberts laughed a rather menacing laugh.",
    "\u201cAre you quite mad Monsieur Poirot I certainly did not murder Mr. Shaitana and I could\nnot possibly have murdered Mrs. Lorrimer.",
    "My dear Battle\u201d he turned to the Scotland\nYard man \u201care you standing for this\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019d better listen to what Monsieur Poirot has to say\u201d said Battle quietly.",
    "Poirot said \u201cIt is true that though I have known for some time that you \u2010 and only you \u2010\ncould have killed Shaitana it would not be an easy matter to prove it.",
    "But Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s\ncase is quite different.\u201d He leaned forward.",
    "\u201cIt is not a case of my knowing.",
    "It is much\nsimpler than that \u2010 for we have an eyewitness who saw you do it.\u201d\nRoberts grew very quiet.",
    "His eyes glittered.",
    "He said sharply \u201cYou are talking rubbish\u201d\n\u201cOh no I am not.",
    "It was early in the morning.",
    "You bluffed your way into Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s\nroom where she was still heavily asleep under the influence of the drug she had taken the\nnight before.",
    "You bluff again \u2010 pretend to see at a glance that she is dead You pack the\nparlour\u2010maid off for brandy hot water all the rest of it.",
    "You are left alone in the room.",
    "The maid has only had the barest peep.",
    "And then what happens\u201d\n\u201cYou may not be aware of the fact Doctor Roberts but certain firms of window cleaners\nspecialize in early morning work.",
    "A window cleaner with his ladder arrived at the same\ntime as you did.",
    "He placed his ladder against the side of the house and began his work.",
    "The first window he tackled was that of Mrs. Lorrimer\u2019s room.",
    "When however he saw\nwhat was going on he quickly retired to another window but he had seen something first.",
    "He shall tell us his own story.\u201d\nPoirot stepped lightly across the floor turned a door handle called \u201cCome in Stephens\u201d\nand returned.",
    "A big awkward\u2010looking man with red hair entered.",
    "In his hand he held a uniform hat\nbearing the legend Chelsea Window Cleaners Association which he twirled awkwardly.",
    "Poirot said \u201cIs there anybody you recognize in this room\u201d\nThe man looked round then gave a bashful nod of the head toward Doctor Roberts.",
    "\u201cHim\u201d he said.",
    "181\n\n\f\u201cTell us when you saw him last and what he was doing\u201d\n\u201cThis morning it was.",
    "Eight o\u2019clock job at a lady\u2019s house in Cheyne Lane.",
    "I started on the\nwindows there.",
    "Lady was in bed.",
    "Looked ill she did.",
    "She was just turning her head round\non the pillow.",
    "This gent I took to be a doctor.",
    "He shoved her sleeve up and jabbed\nsomething into her arm just about here.\u201d He gestured.",
    "\u201cShe just dropped back on the\npillow again.",
    "I thought I\u2019d better hop it to another window so I did.",
    "Hope I didn\u2019t do\nwrong in any way\u201d\n\u201cYou did admirably my friend\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He said quietly \u201cEh bien Doctor Roberts\u201d\n\u201cA \u2010 a simple restorative\u201d stammered Roberts.",
    "\u201cA last hope of bringing her round.",
    "It\u2019s\nmonstrous \u2010\u201d\nPoirot interrupted him.",
    "\u201cA simple restorative N\u2010methyl\u2010clyclo\u2010hexenyl\u2010methyl\u2010malonyl urea\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He\nrolled out the syllables unctuously.",
    "\u201cKnown more simply as Evipan.",
    "Used as an anaesthetic\nfor short operations.",
    "Injected intravenously in large doses it produces instant\nunconsciousness.",
    "It is dangerous to use it after veronal or any barbiturates have been\ngiven.",
    "I noticed the bruised place on her arm where something had obviously been\ninjected into a vein.",
    "A hint to the police surgeon and the drug used was easily discovered\nby no less a person than Sir Charles Imphrey the Home Office analyst.\u201d\n\u201cThat about cooks your goose I think\u201d said Superintendent Battle.",
    "\u201cNo need to prove the\nShaitana business though of course if necessary we can bring a further charge as to the\nmurder of Mr. Charles Craddock \u2010 and possibly his wife also.\u201d\nThe mention of those two names finished Roberts.",
    "He leaned back in his chair.",
    "\u201cI throw in my hand\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve got me I suppose that\nsly devil Shaitana put you wise before you came that evening.",
    "And I thought I\u2019d settled his\nhash so nicely.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t Shaitana you\u2019ve got to thank\u201d said Battle.",
    "\u201cThe honours lie with Monsieur Poirot\nhere.\u201d\nHe went to the door and two men entered.",
    "Superintendent Battle\u2019s voice became official as he made the formal arrest.",
    "As the door closed behind the accused man Mrs. Oliver said happily if not quite truthfully\n\u201cI always said he did it\u201d\n\n182\n\n\fChapter 31\nCards on the Table\nIt was Poirot\u2019s moment every face was turned to his in eager anticipation.",
    "\u201cYou are very\nkind\u201d he said smiling.",
    "\u201cYou know I think that I enjoy my little lecture.",
    "I am a prosy old\nfellow.\u201d\n\u201cThis case to my mind has been one of the most interesting cases I have ever come\nacross.",
    "There was nothing you see to go upon.",
    "There were four people one of whom\nmust have committed the crime but which of the four Was there anything to tell one In\nthe material sense no.",
    "There were no tangible clues \u2010 no fingerprints no incriminating\npapers or documents.",
    "There were only \u2010 the people themselves.\u201d\n\u201cAnd one tangible clue the bridge scores.\u201d\n\u201cYou may remember that from the beginning I showed a particular interest in those\nscores.",
    "They told me something about the various people who had kept them and they\ndid more.",
    "They gave me one valuable hint.",
    "I noticed at once in the third rubber the figure\nof 1500 above the line.",
    "That figure could only represent one thing \u2010 a call of grand slam.",
    "Now if a person were to make up his mind to commit a crime under these somewhat\nunusual circumstances that is during a rubber of bridge that person was clearly running\ntwo serious risks.",
    "The first was that the victim might cry out and the second was that even\nif the victim did not cry out some one of the other three might chance to look up at the\npsychological moment and actually witness the deed.\u201d\n\u201cNow as to the first risk nothing could be done about it.",
    "It was a matter of a gambler\u2019s\nluck.",
    "But something could be done about the second.",
    "It stands to reason that during an\ninteresting or an exciting hand the attention of the three players would be wholly on the\ngame whereas during a dull hand they were more likely to be looking about them.",
    "Now a\nbid of grand slam is always exciting.",
    "It is very often as in this case it was doubled.",
    "Every\none of the three players is playing with close attention \u2010 the declarer to get his contract\nthe adversaries to discard correctly and to get him down.",
    "It was then a distinct possibility\nthat the murder was committed during this particular hand and I determined to find out if\nI could exactly how the bidding had gone.",
    "I soon discovered that dummy during this\nparticular hand had been Doctor Roberts.",
    "I bore that in mind and approached the matter\nfrom my second angle \u2010 psychological probability.",
    "Of the four suspects Mrs. Lorrimer\nstruck me as by far the most likely to plan and carry out a successful murder \u2010 but I could\nnot see her as committing any crime that had to be improvised on the spur of the\nmoment.",
    "On the other hand her manner that first evening puzzled me.",
    "It suggested either\nthat she had committed the murder herself or that she knew who had committed it.",
    "Miss\nMeredith Major Despard and Doctor Roberts were all psychological possibilities though\nas I have already mentioned each of them would have committed the crime from an\nentirely different angle.\u201d\n\u201cI next made a second test.",
    "I got everyone in turn to tell me just what they remembered of\nthe room.",
    "From that I got some very valuable information.",
    "First of all by far the most\nlikely person to have noticed the dagger was Doctor Roberts.",
    "He was a natural observer of\n183\n\n\ftrifles of all kinds \u2010 what is called an observant man.",
    "Of the bridge hands however he\nremembered practically nothing at all.",
    "I did not expect him to remember much hut his\ncomplete forgetfulness looked as though he had had something else on his mind all the\nevening.",
    "Again you see Doctor Roberts was indicated.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lorrimer I found to have a marvellous card memory and I could well imagine that\nwith anyone of her powers of concentration a murder could easily be committed close at\nhand and she would never notice anything.",
    "She gave me a valuable piece of information.",
    "The grand slam was bid by Doctor Roberts quite unjustifiably and he bid it in her suit not\nhis own so that she necessarily played the hand.\u201d\n\u201cThe third test the test on which Superintendent Battle and I built a good deal was the\ndiscovery of the earlier murders so as to establish a similarity of method.",
    "Well the credit\nfor those discoveries belongs to Superintendent Battle to Mrs. Oliver and to Colonel\nRace.",
    "Discussing the matter with my friend Battle he confessed himself disappointed\nbecause there were no points of similarity between any of the three earlier crimes and\nthat of the murder of Mr. Shaitana.",
    "But actually that was not true.",
    "The two murders\nattributed to Doctor Roberts when examined closely and from the psychological point of\nview and not the material one proved to he almost exactly the same.",
    "They too had been\nwhat I might describe as public murders.",
    "A shaving brush boldly infected in the victim\u2019s\nown dressing\u2010room while the doctor officially washes his hands after a visit.",
    "The murder of\nMrs. Craddock under cover of a typhoid inoculation.",
    "Again done quite openly \u2010 in the sight\nof the world as you might say.",
    "And the reaction of the man is the same.",
    "Pushed into a\ncorner he seizes a chance and acts at once \u2010 sheer bold audacious bluff \u2010 exactly like his\nplay at bridge.",
    "As at bridge so in the murder of Shaitana he took a long chance and played\nhis cards well.",
    "The blow was perfectly struck and at exactly the right moment.\u201d\n\u201cNow just at the moment that I had decided quite definitely that Roberts was the man\nMrs. Lorrimer asked me to come and see her \u2010 and quite convincingly accused herself of\nthe crime I nearly believed her For a minute or two I did believe her and then my little\ngray cells reasserted their mastery.",
    "It could not be so it was not\u201d\n\u201cBut what she told me was more difficult still.\u201d\n\u201cShe assured me that she had actually seen Anne Meredith commit the crime.\u201d\n\u201cIt was not till the following morning when I stood by a dead woman\u2019s bed that I saw\nhow I could still be right and Mrs. Lorrimer still have spoken the truth.\u201d\n\u201cAnne Meredith went over to the fireplace and saw that Mr. Shaitana was dead She\nstooped over him perhaps stretched out her hand to the gleaming head of the jewelled\npin.\u201d\n\u201cHer lips part to call out but she does not call out.",
    "She remembers Shaitana\u2019s talk at\ndinner.",
    "Perhaps he has left some record.",
    "She Anne Meredith has a motive for desiring his\ndeath.",
    "Everyone will say that she has killed him.",
    "She dare not call out.",
    "Trembling with fear\nand apprehension she goes back to her seat.\u201d\n184\n\n\f\u201cSo Mrs. Lorrimer is right since she as she thought saw the crime committed but I am\nright too for actually she did not see it.\u201d\n\u201cIf Roberts had held his hand at this point I doubt if we could have ever brought his\ncrimes home to him.",
    "We might have done so by a mixture of bluff and various ingenious\ndevices.",
    "I would at any rate have tried.",
    "But he lost his nerve and once again overbid his\nhand.",
    "And this time the cards lay wrong for him and he came down heavily.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt he was uneasy.",
    "He knew that Battle was nosing about.",
    "He foresaw the present\nsituation going on indefinitely the police still searching \u2010 and perhaps by some miracle\ncoming on traces of his former crimes.",
    "He hit upon the brilliant idea of making Mrs.\nLorrimer the scapegoat for the party.",
    "His practiced eye guessed no doubt that she was ill\nand that her life could not be very much prolonged.",
    "How natural in those circumstances\nfor her to choose a quick way out and before taking it confess to the crime So he\nmanages to get a sample of her hand\u2010writing\u2010forges three identical letters and arrives at\nthe house hotfoot in the morning with his story of the letter he has just received.",
    "His\nparlour\u2010maid quite correctly is instructed to ring up the police.",
    "All he needs is a start.",
    "And\nhe gets it.",
    "By the time the police surgeon arrives it is all over.",
    "Doctor Roberts is ready with\nhis story of artificial respiration that has failed.",
    "It is all perfectly plausible perfectly\nstraightforward.\u201d\n\u201cIn all this he has no idea of throwing suspicion on Anne Meredith.",
    "He does not even know\nof her visit the night before.",
    "It is suicide and security only that he is aiming at.\u201d\n\u201cIt is in fact an awkward moment for him when I ask if he is acquainted with Mrs.\nLorrimer\u2019s handwriting.",
    "If the forgery has been detected he must save himself by saying\nthat he has never seen her handwriting.",
    "His mind works quickly but not quickly enough.\u201d\n\u201cFrom Wallingford I telephone to Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She plays her part by lulling his suspicions\nand bringing him here.",
    "And then when he is congratulating himself that all is well though\nnot exactly in the way he has planned the blow falls.",
    "Hercule Poirot springs And so \u2010 the\ngambler will gather in no more tricks.",
    "He has thrown his cards upon the table.",
    "C\u2019est fini.\u201d\nThere was silence.",
    "Rhoda broke it with a sigh.",
    "\u201cWhat amazing luck that window cleaner happened to be there\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cLuck Luck That was not luck mademoiselle.",
    "That was the gray cells of Hercule Poirot.",
    "And that reminds me \u2010\u201d\nHe went to the door.",
    "\u201cCome in \u2010 come in my dear fellow.",
    "You acted your part \u00e0 merveille.\u201d\nHe returned accompanied by the window cleaner who now held his red hair in his hand\nand who looked somehow a very different person.",
    "\u201cMy friend Mr. Gerald Hemmingway a very promising young actor.\u201d\n185\n\n\f\u201cThen there was no window cleaner\u201d cried Rhoda.",
    "\u201cNobody saw him\u201d\n\u201cI saw\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cWith the eyes of the mind one can see more than with the eyes of\nthe body.",
    "One leans back and closes the eyes \u2010\u201d\nDespard said cheerfully \u201cLet\u2019s stab him Rhoda and see if his ghost can come back and\nfind out who did it.\u201d\n\n186"
