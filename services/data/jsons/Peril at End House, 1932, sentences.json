    "The Peril at End House\nAgatha Christie\n1932\nA Hercule Poirot Mystery\n\n\n\fChapter 1\nThe Majestic Hotel\nNo seaside town in the south of England is I think as attractive as St Loo.",
    "It is\nwell named the Queen of Watering Places and reminds one forcibly of the\nRiviera.",
    "The Cornish coast is to my mind every bit as fascinating as that of the\nsouth of France.",
    "I remarked as much to my friend Hercule Poirot.",
    "So it said on our menu in the\nrestaurant car yesterday mon ami.",
    "Your remark is not original.",
    "But dont you agree\nHe was smiling to himself and did not at once answer my question.",
    "I repeated it.",
    "A thousand pardons Hastings.",
    "My thoughts were wandering.",
    "Wandering indeed\nto that part of the world you mentioned just now.",
    "The south of France\nYes.",
    "I was thinking of that last winter that I spent there and of the events which\noccurred.",
    "I remembered.",
    "A murder had been committed on the Blue Train and the\nmysterya complicated and baffling onehad been solved by Poirot with his usual\nunerring acumen.",
    "How I wish I had been with you I said with deep regret.",
    "I too said Poirot.",
    "Your experience would have been invaluable to me.",
    "I looked at him sideways.",
    "As a result of long habit I distrust his compliments but\nhe appeared perfectly serious.",
    "And after all why not I have a very long\nexperience of the methods he employs.",
    "What I particularly missed was your vivid imagination Hastings he went on\ndreamily.",
    "One needs a certain amount of light relief.",
    "My valet Georges an\n3\n\n\fadmirable man with whom I sometimes permitted myself to discuss a point has\nno imagination whatever.",
    "This remark seemed to me quite irrelevant.",
    "Tell me Poirot I said.",
    "Are you never tempted to renew your activities This\npassive life\nSuits me admirably my friend.",
    "To sit in the sunwhat could be more charming\nTo step from your pedestal at the zenith of your famewhat could be a grander\ngesture They say of me That is Hercule PoirotThe greatthe uniqueThere\nwas never any one like him there never will be Eh bienI am satisfied.",
    "I ask no\nmore.",
    "I am modest.",
    "I should not myself have used the word modest.",
    "It seemed to me that my little\nfriends egotism had certainly not declined with his years.",
    "He leaned back in his\nchair caressing his moustache and almost purring with selfsatisfaction.",
    "We were sitting on one of the terraces of the Majestic Hotel.",
    "It is the biggest\nhotel in St Loo and stands in its own grounds on a headland overlooking the sea.",
    "The gardens of the hotel lay below us freely interspersed with palm trees.",
    "The\nsea was of a deep and lovely blue the sky clear and the sun shining with all the\nsinglehearted fervour an August sun should but in England so often does not\nhave.",
    "There was a vigorous humming of bees a pleasant soundand altogether\nnothing could have been more ideal.",
    "We had only arrived last night and this was the first morning of what we\nproposed should be a weeks stay.",
    "If only these weather conditions continued\nwe should indeed have a perfect holiday.",
    "I picked up the morning paper which had fallen from my hand and resumed my\nperusal of the mornings news.",
    "The political situation seemed unsatisfactory but\nuninteresting there was trouble in China there was a long account of a\nrumoured City swindle but on the whole there was no news of a very thrilling\norder.",
    "Curious thing this parrot disease I remarked as I turned the sheet.",
    "Very curious.",
    "4\n\n\fTwo more deaths at Leeds I see.",
    "Most regrettable.",
    "I turned a page.",
    "Still no news of that flying fellow Seton in his roundtheworld flight.",
    "Pretty\nplucky these fellows.",
    "That amphibian machine of his the Albatross must be a\ngreat invention.",
    "Too bad if hes gone west.",
    "Not that theyve given up hope yet.",
    "He may have made one of the Pacific islands.",
    "The Solomon islanders are still cannibals are they not inquired Poirot\npleasantly.",
    "Must be a fine fellow.",
    "That sort of thing makes one feel its a good thing to be an\nEnglishman after all.",
    "It consoles for the defeats at Wimbledon said Poirot.",
    "II didnt mean I began.",
    "My friend waved my attempted apology aside gracefully.",
    "Me he announced.",
    "I am not amphibian like the machine of the poor Captain\nSeton but I am cosmopolitan.",
    "And for the English I have always had as you\nknow a great admiration.",
    "The thorough way for instance in which they read\nthe daily paper.",
    "My attention had strayed to political news.",
    "They seem to be giving the Home Secretary a pretty bad time of it I remarked\nwith a chuckle.",
    "The poor man.",
    "He has his troubles that one.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "So much so that he seeks\nfor help in the most improbable quarters.",
    "I stared at him.",
    "5\n\n\fWith a slight smile Poirot drew from his pocket his mornings correspondence\nneatly secured by a rubber band.",
    "From this he selected one letter which he\ntossed across to me.",
    "It must have missed us yesterday he said.",
    "I read the letter with a pleasurable feeling of excitement.",
    "But Poirot I cried.",
    "This is most flattering\nYou think so my friend\nHe speaks in the warmest terms of your ability.",
    "He is right said Poirot modestly averting his eyes.",
    "He begs you to investigate this matter for himputs it as a personal favour.",
    "Quite so.",
    "It is unnecessary to repeat all this to me.",
    "You understand my dear\nHastings.",
    "I have read the letter myself.",
    "It is too bad I cried.",
    "This will put an end to our holiday.",
    "No no calmez vous there is no question of that.",
    "But the Home Secretary says the matter is urgent.",
    "He may be rightor again he may not.",
    "These politicians they are easily excited.",
    "I\nhave seen myself in the Chambre des Deput\u00e9s in Paris\nYes yes but Poirot surely we ought to be making arrangements The express\nto London has goneit leaves at twelve oclock.",
    "The next\nCalm yourself Hastings calm yourself I pray of you Always the excitement the\nagitation.",
    "We are not going to London today nor yet tomorrow.",
    "But this summons\nDoes not concern me.",
    "I do not belong to your police force Hastings.",
    "I am asked\nto undertake a case as a private investigator.",
    "I refuse.",
    "6\n\n\fYou refuse\nCertainly.",
    "I write with perfect politeness tender my regrets my apologies\nexplain that I am completely desolatedbut what will you I have retiredI am\nfinished.",
    "You are not finished I exclaimed warmly.",
    "Poirot patted my knee.",
    "There speaks the good friendthe faithful dog.",
    "And you have reason too.",
    "The\ngrey cells they still functionthe order the methodit is still there.",
    "But when I\nhave retired my friend I have retired It is finished I am not a stage favourite\nwho gives the world a dozen farewells.",
    "In all generosity I say let the young men\nhave a chance.",
    "They may possibly do something creditable.",
    "I doubt it but they\nmay.",
    "Anyway they will do well enough for this doubtless tiresome affair of the\nHome Secretarys.",
    "But Poirot the compliment\nMe I am above compliments.",
    "The Home Secretary being a man of sense\nrealizes that if he can only obtain my services all will be successful.",
    "What will\nyou He is unlucky.",
    "Hercule Poirot has solved his last case.",
    "I looked at him.",
    "In my heart of hearts I deplored his obstinacy.",
    "The solving of\nsuch a case as was indicated might add still further lustre to his already worldwide reputation.",
    "Nevertheless I could not but admire his unyielding attitude.",
    "Suddenly a thought struck me and I smiled.",
    "I wonder I said that you are not afraid.",
    "Such an emphatic pronouncement will\nsurely tempt the gods.",
    "Impossible he replied that anyone should shake the decision of Hercule\nPoirot.",
    "Impossible Poirot\n\n7\n\n\fYou are right mon ami one should not use such a word.",
    "Eh ma foi I do not say\nthat if a bullet should strike the wall by my head I would not investigate the\nmatter One is human after all\nI smiled.",
    "A little pebble had just struck the terrace beside us and Poirots fanciful\nanalogy from it tickled my fancy.",
    "He stooped now and picked up the pebble as\nhe went on.",
    "Yesone is human.",
    "One is the sleeping dogwell and good but the sleeping dog\ncan be roused.",
    "There is a proverb in your language that says so.",
    "In fact I said if you find a dagger planted by your pillow tomorrow morninglet\nthe criminal who put it there beware\nHe nodded but rather absently.",
    "Suddenly to my surprise he rose and descended the couple of steps that led\nfrom the terrace to the garden.",
    "As he did so a girl came into sight hurrying up\ntowards us.",
    "I had just registered the impression that she was a decidedly pretty girl when my\nattention was drawn to Poirot who not looking where he was going had\nstumbled over a root and fallen heavily.",
    "He was just abreast of the girl at the\ntime and she and I between us helped him to his feet.",
    "My attention was\nnaturally on my friend but I was conscious of an impression of dark hair an\nimpish face and big darkblue eyes.",
    "A thousand pardons stammered Poirot.",
    "Mademoiselle you are most kind.",
    "I\nregret exceedinglyouchmy foot he pains me considerably.",
    "No no it is nothing\nreallythe turned ankle that is all.",
    "In a few minutes all will be well.",
    "But if you\ncould help me Hastingsyou and Mademoiselle between you if she will be so\nvery kind.",
    "I am ashamed to ask it of her.",
    "With me on the one side and the girl on the other we soon got Poirot on to a\nchair on the terrace.",
    "I then suggested fetching a doctor but this my friend\nnegatived sharply.",
    "8\n\n\fIt is nothing I tell you.",
    "The ankle turned that is all.",
    "Painful for the moment but\nsoon over.",
    "He made a grimace.",
    "See in a little minute I shall have forgotten.",
    "Mademoiselle I thank you a thousand times.",
    "You were most kind.",
    "Sit down I\nbeg of you.",
    "The girl took a chair.",
    "Its nothing she said.",
    "But I wish you would let it be seen to.",
    "Mademoiselle I assure you it is a bagatelle  In the pleasure of your society the\npain passes already.",
    "The girl laughed.",
    "Thats good.",
    "What about a cocktail I suggested.",
    "Its just about the time.",
    "Well She hesitated.",
    "Thanks very much.",
    "Martini\nYes pleasedry Martini.",
    "I went off.",
    "On my return after having ordered the drinks I found Poirot and the\ngirl engaged in animated conversation.",
    "Imagine Hastings he said that house therethe one on the pointthat we have\nadmired so much it belongs to Mademoiselle here.",
    "Indeed I said though I was unable to recall having expressed any admiration.",
    "In fact I had hardly noticed the house.",
    "It looks rather eerie and imposing\nstanding there by itself far from anything.",
    "Its called End House said the girl.",
    "I love itbut its a tumbledown old place.",
    "Going to rack and ruin.",
    "You are the last of an old family Mademoiselle\n\n9\n\n\fOh were nothing important.",
    "But there have been Buckleys here for two or\nthree hundred years.",
    "My brother died three years ago so Im the last of the\nfamily.",
    "That is sad.",
    "You live there alone Mademoiselle\nOh Im away a good deal and when Im at home theres usually a cheery crowd\ncoming and going.",
    "That is so modern.",
    "Me I was picturing you in a dark mysterious mansion\nhaunted by a family curse.",
    "How marvellous What a picturesque imagination you must have.",
    "No its not\nhaunted.",
    "Or if so the ghost is a beneficent one.",
    "Ive had three escapes from\nsudden death in as many days so I must bear a charmed life.",
    "Poirot sat up alertly.",
    "Escapes from death That sounds interesting Mademoiselle.",
    "Oh they werent very thrilling.",
    "Just accidents you know.",
    "She jerked her head\nsharply as a wasp flew past.",
    "Curse these wasps.",
    "There must be a nest of them\nround here.",
    "The bees and the waspsyou do not like them Mademoiselle You have been\nstungyes\nNobut I hate the way they come right past your face.",
    "The bee in the bonnet said Poirot.",
    "Your English phrase.",
    "At that moment the cocktails arrived.",
    "We all held up our glasses and made the\nusual inane observations.",
    "Im due in the hotel for cocktails really said Miss Buckley.",
    "I expect theyre\nwondering what has become of me.",
    "Poirot cleared his throat and set down his glass.",
    "10\n\n\fAh for a cup of good rich chocolate he murmured.",
    "But in England they make it\nnot.",
    "Still in England you have some very pleasing customs.",
    "The young girls their\nhats come on and offso prettilyso easily\nThe girl stared at him.",
    "What do you mean Why shouldnt they\nYou ask that because you are youngso young Mademoiselle.",
    "But to me the\nnatural thing seems to have a coiffure high and rigidsoand the hat attached\nwith many hat pinsl\u00e0l\u00e0l\u00e0et l\u00e0.",
    "He executed four vicious jabs in the air.",
    "But how frightfully uncomfortable\nAh I should think so said Poirot.",
    "No martyred lady could have spoken with\nmore feeling.",
    "When the wind blew it was the agonyit gave you the migraine.",
    "Miss Buckley dragged off the simple widebrimmed felt she was wearing and\ncast it down beside her.",
    "And now we do this she laughed.",
    "Which is sensible and charming said Poirot with a little bow.",
    "I looked at her with interest.",
    "Her dark hair was ruffled and gave her an elfin look.",
    "There was something elfin about her altogether.",
    "The small vivid face pansy\nshaped the enormous darkblue eyes and something elsesomething haunting\nand arresting.",
    "Was it a hint of recklessness There were dark shadows under the\neyes.",
    "The terrace on which we were sitting was a littleused one.",
    "The main terrace\nwhere most people sat was just round the corner at a point where the cliff\nshelved directly down to the sea.",
    "From round this corner now there appeared a man a redfaced man with a\nrolling carriage who carried his hands half clenched by his side.",
    "There was\nsomething breezy and carefree about hima typical sailor.",
    "11\n\n\fI cant think where the girls got to he was saying in tones that easily carried to\nwhere we sat.",
    "NickNick.",
    "Miss Buckley rose.",
    "I knew theyd be getting in a state.",
    "AttaboyGeorgehere I am.",
    "Freddies frantic for a drink.",
    "Come on girl.",
    "He cast a glance of frank curiosity at Poirot who must have differed considerably\nfrom most of Nicks friends.",
    "The girl performed a wave of introduction.",
    "This is Commander Challengerer\nBut to my surprise Poirot did not supply the name for which she was waiting.",
    "Instead he rose bowed very ceremoniously and murmured Of the English Navy.",
    "I have a great regard for the English Navy.",
    "This type of remark is not one that an Englishman acclaims most readily.",
    "Commander Challenger flushed and Nick Buckley took command of the\nsituation.",
    "Come on George.",
    "Dont gape.",
    "Lets find Freddie and Jim.",
    "She smiled at Poirot.",
    "Thanks for the cocktail.",
    "I hope the ankle will be all right.",
    "With a nod to me she slipped her hand through the sailors arm and they\ndisappeared round the corner together.",
    "So that is one of Mademoiselles friends murmured Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "One of\nher cheery crowd.",
    "What about him Give me your expert judgement Hastings.",
    "Is\nhe what you call a good fellowyes\nPausing for a moment to try and decide exactly what Poirot thought I should\nmean by a good fellow I gave a doubtful assent.",
    "12\n\n\fHe seems all rightyes I said.",
    "So far as one can tell by a cursory glance.",
    "I wonder said Poirot.",
    "The girl had left her hat behind.",
    "Poirot stooped to pick it up and twirled it round\nabsentmindedly on his finger.",
    "Has he atendresse for her What do you think Hastings\nMy dear Poirot How can I tell Heregive me that hat.",
    "The lady will want it.",
    "Ill\ntake it to her.",
    "Poirot paid no attention to my request.",
    "He continued to revolve the hat slowly\non his finger.",
    "Pas encore.",
    "\u00c7a mamuse.",
    "Really Poirot\nYes my friend I grow old and childish do I not\nThis was so exactly what I was feeling that I was somewhat disconcerted to have\nit put into words.",
    "Poirot gave a little chuckle then leaning forward he laid a\nfinger against the side of his nose.",
    "But noI am not so completely imbecile as you think We will return the hatbut\nassuredlybut later We will return it to End House and thus we shall have the\nopportunity of seeing the charming Miss Nick again.",
    "Poirot I said.",
    "I believe you have fallen in love.",
    "She is a pretty girleh\nWellyou saw for yourself.",
    "Why ask me\nBecause alas I cannot judge.",
    "To me nowadays anything young is beautiful.",
    "Jeunessejeunesse.",
    "It is the tragedy of my years.",
    "But youI appeal to you Your\njudgement is not uptodate naturally having lived in the Argentine so long.",
    "You\n\n13\n\n\fadmire the figure of five years ago but you are at any rate more modern than I\nam.",
    "She is prettyyes She has the appeal to the sexes\nOne sex is sufficient Poirot.",
    "The answer I should say is very much in the\naffirmative.",
    "Why are you so interested in the lady\nAm I interested\nWelllook at what youve just being saying.",
    "You are under a misapprehension mon ami.",
    "I may be interested in the ladyyesbut I am much more interested in her hat.",
    "I stared at him but he appeared perfectly serious.",
    "He nodded his head at me.",
    "Yes Hastings this very hat.",
    "He held it towards me.",
    "You see the reason for my\ninterest\nIts a nice hat I said bewildered.",
    "But quite an ordinary hat.",
    "Lots of girls have\nhats like it.",
    "Not like this one.",
    "I looked at it more closely.",
    "You see Hastings\nA perfectly plain fawn felt.",
    "Good style\nI did not ask you to describe the hat.",
    "It is plain that you do not see.",
    "Almost\nincredible my poor Hastings how you hardly ever do see It amazes me every\ntime anew But regard my dear old imbecileit is not necessary to employ the\ngrey cellsthe eyes will do.",
    "Regardregard\nAnd then at last I saw to what he had been trying to draw my attention.",
    "The\nslowly turning hat was revolving on his finger and that finger was stuck neatly\nthrough a hole in the brim of the hat.",
    "When he saw that I had realized his\n14\n\n\fmeaning he drew his finger out and held the hat towards me.",
    "It was a small neat\nhole quite round and I could not imagine its purpose if purpose it had.",
    "Did you observe the way Mademoiselle Nick flinched when a bee flew past The\nbee in the bonnetthe hole in the hat.",
    "But a bee couldnt make a hole like that.",
    "Exactly Hastings What acumen It could not.",
    "But a bullet could mon cher\nA bullet\nMai oui A bullet like this.",
    "He held out his hand with a small object in the palm of it.",
    "A spent bullet mon ami.",
    "It was that which hit the terrace just now when we\nwere talking.",
    "A spent bullet\nYou mean\nI mean that one inch of a difference and that hole would not be through the hat\nbut through the head.",
    "Now do you see why I am interested Hastings You were\nright my friend when you told me not to use the word impossible.",
    "Yesone is\nhuman Ah but he made a grave mistake that wouldbe murderer when he\nshot at his victim within a dozen yards of Hercule Poirot For him it is indeed la\nmauvaise chance.",
    "But you see now why we must make our entry into End House\nand get into touch with Mademoiselle Three near escapes from death in three\ndays.",
    "That is what she said.",
    "We must act quickly Hastings.",
    "The peril is very close\nat hand.",
    "15\n\n\f16\n\n\fChapter 2\nEnd House\nPoirot I said.",
    "I have been thinking.",
    "An admirable exercise my friend.",
    "Continue it.",
    "We were sitting facing each other at lunch at a small table in the window.",
    "This shot must have been fired quite close to us.",
    "And yet we did not hear it.",
    "And you think that in the peaceful stillness with the rippling waves the only\nsound we should have done so\nWell its odd.",
    "No it is not odd.",
    "Some soundsyou get used to them so soon that you hardly\nnotice they are there.",
    "All this morning my friend speedboats have been making\ntrips in the bay.",
    "You complained at firstsoon you did not even notice.",
    "But ma\nfoi you could fire a machine gun almost and not notice it when one of those\nboats is on the sea.",
    "Yes thats true.",
    "Ah voil\u00e0 murmured Poirot.",
    "Mademoiselle and her friends.",
    "They are to lunch\nhere it seems.",
    "And therefore I must return the hat.",
    "But no matter.",
    "The affair is\nsufficiently serious to warrant a visit all on its own.",
    "He leaped up nimbly from his seat hurried across the room and presented the\nhat with a bow just as Miss Buckley and her companions were seating\nthemselves at table.",
    "They were a party of four Nick Buckley Commander Challenger another man\nand another girl.",
    "From where we sat we had a very imperfect view of them.",
    "From time to time the naval mans laugh boomed out.",
    "He seemed a simple\nlikeable soul and I had already taken a fancy to him.",
    "17\n\n\fMy friend was silent and distrait during our meal.",
    "He crumbled his bread made\nstrange little ejaculations to himself and straightened everything on the table.",
    "I\ntried to talk but meeting with no encouragement soon gave up.",
    "He continued to sit on at the table long after he had finished his cheese.",
    "As soon\nas the other party had left the room however he too rose to his feet.",
    "They were\njust settling themselves at a table in the lounge when Poirot marched up to them\nin his most military fashion and addressed Nick directly.",
    "Mademoiselle may I crave one little word with you.",
    "The girl frowned.",
    "I realized her feelings clearly enough.",
    "She was afraid that this\nqueer little foreigner was going to be a nuisance.",
    "I could not but sympathize with\nher knowing how it must appear in her eyes.",
    "Rather unwillingly she moved a\nfew steps aside.",
    "Almost immediately I saw an expression of surprise pass over her face at the low\nhurried words Poirot was uttering.",
    "In the meantime I was feeling rather awkward and ill at ease.",
    "Challenger with\nready tact came to my rescue offering me a cigarette and making some\ncommonplace observation.",
    "We had taken each others measure and were\ninclined to be sympathetic to each other.",
    "I fancied that I was more his own kind\nthan the man with whom he had been lunching.",
    "I now had the opportunity of\nobserving the latter.",
    "A tall fair rather exquisite young man with a rather fleshy\nnose and overemphasized good looks.",
    "He had a supercilious manner and a tired\ndrawl.",
    "There was a sleekness about him that I especially disliked.",
    "Then I looked at the woman.",
    "She was sitting straight opposite me in a big chair\nand had just thrown off her hat.",
    "She was an unusual typea weary Madonna\ndescribes it best.",
    "She had fair almost colourless hair parted in the middle and\ndrawn straight down over her ears to a knot in the neck.",
    "Her face was dead\nwhite and emaciatedyet curiously attractive.",
    "Her eyes were very light grey with\nlarge pupils.",
    "She had a curious look of detachment.",
    "She was staring at me.",
    "Suddenly she spoke.",
    "Sit downtill your friend has finished with Nick.",
    "18\n\n\fShe had an affected voice languid and artificialyet which had a curious\nattractiona kind of resonant lingering beauty.",
    "She impressed me I think as the\nmost tired person I had ever met.",
    "Tired in mind not in body as though she had\nfound everything in the world to be empty and valueless.",
    "Miss Buckley very kindly helped my friend when he twisted his ankle this\nmorning I explained as I accepted her offer.",
    "So Nick said.",
    "Her eyes considered me still detachedly.",
    "Nothing wrong with his\nankle now is there\nI felt myself blushing.",
    "Just a momentary sprain I explained.",
    "Oh wellIm glad to hear Nick didnt invent the whole thing.",
    "Shes the most\nheavensent little liar that ever existed you know.",
    "Amazingits quite a gift.",
    "I hardly knew what to say.",
    "My discomfiture seemed to amuse her.",
    "Shes one of my oldest friends she said and I always think loyaltys such a\ntiresome virtue dont you Principally practised by the Scotslike thrift and\nkeeping the Sabbath.",
    "But Nick is a liar isnt she Jim That marvellous story\nabout the brakes of the carand Jim says there was nothing in it at all.",
    "The fair man said in a soft rich voice I know something about cars.",
    "He half turned his head.",
    "Outside amongst other cars was a long red car.",
    "It\nseemed longer and redder than any car could be.",
    "It had a long gleaming bonnet\nof polished metal.",
    "A super car\nIs that your car I asked on a sudden impulse.",
    "He nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "I had an insane desire to say It would be\n19\n\n\fPoirot rejoined us at that moment.",
    "I rose he took me by the arm gave a quick\nbow to the party and drew me rapidly away.",
    "It is arranged my friend.",
    "We are to call on Mademoiselle at End House at halfpast six.",
    "She will be returned from the motoring by then.",
    "Yes yes surely she will\nhave returnedin safety.",
    "His face was anxious and his tone was worried.",
    "What did you say to her\nI asked her to accord me an interviewas soon as possible.",
    "She was a little\nunwillingnaturally.",

    "She admits that she will be back\nby sixthirty.",
    "\u00c7a y est\nI remarked that that seemed to be all right then but my remark met with little\nfavour.",
    "Indeed Poirot was as jumpy as the proverbial cat.",
    "He walked about our\nsittingroom all the afternoon murmuring to himself and ceaselessly rearranging\nand straightening the ornaments.",
    "When I spoke to him he waved his hands and\nshook his head.",
    "In the end we started out from the hotel at barely six oclock.",
    "It seems incredible I remarked as we descended the steps of the terrace.",
    "To\nattempt to shoot anyone in a hotel garden.",
    "Only a madman would do such a\nthing.",
    "I disagree with you.",
    "Given one condition it would be quite a reasonably safe\naffair.",
    "To begin with the garden is deserted.",
    "The people who come to hotels are\nlike a flock of sheep.",
    "It is customary to sit on the terrace overlooking the bayeh\nbien so everyone sits on the terrace.",
    "Only I who am an original sit overlooking\nthe garden.",
    "And even then I saw nothing.",
    "There is plenty of cover you observetrees groups of palms flowering shrubs.",
    "Anyone could hide himself comfortably\nand be unobserved whilst he waited for Mademoiselle to pass this way.",
    "And she\n20\n\n\fwould come this way.",
    "To come round by the road from End House would be\nmuch longer.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick Buckley she would be of those who are always\nlate and taking the short cut\nAll the same the risk was enormous.",
    "He might have been seenand you cant\nmake shooting look like an accident.",
    "Not like an accident no.",
    "What do you mean\nNothinga little idea.",
    "I may or may not be justified.",
    "Leaving it aside for a\nmoment there is what I mentioned just nowan essential condition.",
    "Which is\nSurely you can tell me Hastings.",
    "I wouldnt like to deprive you of the pleasure of being clever at my expense\nOh the sarcasm The irony Well what leaps to the eye is this the motive\ncannot be obvious.",

    "These accidentsI want to hear about them\nHe turned back abruptly.",
    "It is still early.",
    "We will go the other way by the road.",
    "The garden has nothing to\ntell us.",
    "Let us inspect the orthodox approach to End House.",
    "Our way led out of the front gate of the hotel and up a sharp hill to the right.",
    "At\nthe top of it was a small lane with a notice on the wall TO END HOUSE ONLY.",
    "21\n\n\fWe followed it and after a few hundred yards the lane gave an abrupt turn and\nended in a pair of dilapidated entrance gates which would have been the better\nfor a coat of paint.",
    "Inside the gates to the right was a small lodge.",
    "This lodge presented a piquant\ncontrast to the gates and to the condition of the grassgrown drive.",
    "The small\ngarden round it was spick and span the window frames and sashes had been\nlately painted and there were clean bright curtains at the windows.",
    "Bending over a flowerbed was a man in a faded Norfolk jacket.",
    "He straightened\nup as the gate creaked and turned to look at us.",
    "He was a man of about sixty six\nfoot at least with a powerful frame and a weatherbeaten face.",
    "His head was\nalmost completely bald.",
    "His eyes were a vivid blue and twinkled.",
    "He seemed a\ngenial soul.",
    "Goodafternoon he observed as we passed.",
    "I responded in kind and as we went on up the drive I was conscious of those blue\neyes raking our backs inquisitively.",
    "I wonder said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "He left it at that without vouchsafing any explanation of what it was that he\nwondered.",
    "The house itself was large and rather dreary looking.",
    "It was shut in by trees the\nbranches of which actually touched the roof.",
    "It was clearly in bad repair.",
    "Poirot\nswept it with an appraising glance before ringing the bellan oldfashioned bell\nthat needed a Herculean pull to produce any effect and which once started\nechoed mournfully on and on.",

    "Indeed I flatter myself that it was my\n22\n\n\fappearance which turned the scale.",
    "We were admitted and ushered into the\ndrawingroom to await Miss Buckleys return.",
    "There was no mournful note here.",
    "The room gave on the sea and was full of\nsunshine.",
    "It was shabby and betrayed conflicting stylesultra modern of a cheap\nvariety superimposed on solid Victorian.",
    "The curtains were of faded brocade but\nthe covers were new and gay and the cushions were positively hectic.",
    "On the\nwalls were hung family portraits.",
    "Some of them I thought looked remarkably\ngood.",
    "There was a gramophone and there were some records lying idly about.",
    "There were a portable wireless practically no books and one newspaper flung\nopen on the end of the sofa.",
    "Poirot picked it upthen laid it down with a grimace.",
    "It was the St Loo Weekly Herald and Directory.",
    "Something impelled him to pick it\nup a second time and he was glancing at a column when the door opened and\nNick Buckley came into the room.",
    "Bring the ice Ellen she called over her shoulder then addressed herself to us.",
    "Well here I amand Ive shaken off the others.",
    "Im devoured with curiosity.",

    "Alas Mademoiselle began Poirot.",
    "Dont say its the opposite she begged him.",
    "Dont say you paint miniatures and\nwant me to buy one.",

    "The woman who had opened the door to us came into the room with ice and a\ntray of bottles.",
    "Nick mixed cocktails expertly continuing to talk.",
    "I think at last\nPoirots silence so unlike him impressed itself upon her.",
    "She stopped in the\nvery act of filling the glasses and said sharply Well\nThat is what I wish it to bewell Mademoiselle.",
    "He took the cocktail from her\nhand.",
    "To your good health Mademoiselleto your continued good health.",
    "23\n\n\fThe girl was no fool.",
    "The significance of his tone was not lost on her.",
    "Isanything the matter\nYes Mademoiselle.",
    "This...",
    "He held out his hand to her with the bullet on the palm of it.",
    "She picked it up\nwith a puzzled frown.",
    "You know what that is\nYes of course I know.",
    "Its a bullet.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Mademoiselleit was not a wasp that flew past your face this morningit\nwas this bullet.",
    "Do you meanwas some criminal idiot shooting bullets in a hotel garden\nIt would seem so.",
    "Well Im damned said Nick frankly.",
    "I do seem to bear a charmed life.",
    "Thats\nnumber four.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "That is number four.",
    "I want Mademoiselle to hear about the\nother threeaccidents.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "I want to be very sure Mademoiselle that they wereaccidents.",
    "Why of course What else could they be\nMademoiselle prepare yourself I beg for a great shock.",
    "What if someone is\nattempting your life\nAll Nicks response to this was a burst of laughter.",
    "The idea seemed to amuse her\nhugely.",
    "What a marvellous idea My dear man who on earth do you think would\nattempt my life Im not the beautiful young heiress whose death releases\n24\n\n\fmillions.",
    "I wish somebody was trying to kill methat would be a thrill if you likebut Im afraid theres not a hope\nWill you tell me Mademoiselle about those accidents\nOf coursebut theres nothing in it.",
    "They were just stupid things.",
    "Theres a heavy\npicture hangs over my bed.",
    "It fell in the night.",
    "Just by pure chance I had\nhappened to hear a door banging somewhere in the house and went down to\nfind it and shut itand so I escaped.",
    "It would probably have bashed my head in.",
    "Thats No.",
    "1.",
    "Poirot did not smile.",
    "Continue Mademoiselle.",
    "Let us pass to No.",
    "2.",
    "Oh thats weaker still.",
    "Theres a scrambly cliff path down to the sea.",
    "I go down\nthat way to bathe.",
    "Theres a rock you can dive off.",
    "A boulder got dislodged\nsomehow and came roaring down just missing me.",
    "The third thing was quite\ndifferent.",
    "Something went wrong with the brakes of the carI dont know quite\nwhatthe garage man explained but I didnt follow it.",
    "Anyway if Id gone through\nthe gate and down the hill they wouldnt have held and I suppose Id have gone\nslap into the Town Hall and there would have been the devil of a smash.",
    "Slight\ndefacement of the Town Hall complete obliteration of me.",
    "But owing to my\nalways leaving something behind I turned back and merely ran into the laurel\nhedge.",
    "And you cannot tell me what the trouble was\nYou can go and ask them at Motts Garage.",
    "Theyll know.",
    "It was something quite\nsimple and mechanical that had been unscrewed I think.",
    "I wondered if Ellens\nboy my standby who opened the door to you has got a small boy had tinkered\nwith it.",
    "Boys do like messing about with cars.",
    "Of course Ellen swore hed never\nbeen near the car.",
    "I think something must just have worked loose in spite of\nwhat Mott said.",
    "Where is your garage Mademoiselle\nRound the other side of the house.",
    "25\n\n\fIs it kept locked\nNicks eyes widened in surprise.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Of course not.",
    "Anyone could tamper with the car unobserved\nWellyesI suppose so.",
    "But its so silly.",
    "No Mademoiselle.",
    "It is not silly.",
    "You do not understand.",
    "You are in dangergrave\ndanger.",
    "I tell it to you.",
    "I And you do not know who I am\nNo.",
    "said Nick breathlessly.",
    "I am Hercule Poirot.",
    "Oh said Nick in rather a flat tone.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "You know my name eh\nOh yes.",
    "She wriggled uncomfortably.",
    "A hunted look came into her eyes.",
    "Poirot observed\nher keenly.",
    "You are not at ease.",
    "That means I suppose that you have not read my books.",
    "Wellnonot all of them.",
    "But I know the name of course.",
    "Mademoiselle you are a polite little liar.",
    "I started remembering the words\nspoken at the Majestic Hotel that day after lunch.",
    "I forgetyou are only a childyou would not have heard.",
    "So quickly does fame pass.",
    "My friend therehe will\ntell you.",
    "Nick looked at me.",
    "I cleared my throat somewhat embarrassed.",
    "Monsieur Poirot iserwasa great detective I explained.",
    "26\n\n\fAh my friend cried Poirot.",
    "Is that all you can find to say Mais dis donc Say\nthen to Mademoiselle that I am a detective unique unsurpassed the greatest\nthat ever lived\nThat is now unnecessary I said coldly.",
    "You have told her yourself.",
    "Ah yes but it is more agreeable to have been able to preserve the modesty.",
    "One should not sing ones own praises.",
    "One should not keep a dog and have to bark oneself agreed Nick with mock\nsympathy.",
    "Who is the dog by the way Dr Watson I presume.",
    "My name is Hastings I said coldly.",
    "Battle of1066 said Nick.",
    "Who said I wasnt educated Well this is all too too\nmarvellous Do you think someone really wants to do away with me It would be\nthrilling.",
    "But of course that sort of thing doesnt really happen.",
    "Only in books.",
    "I\nexpect Monsieur Poirot is like a surgeon whos invented an operation or a doctor\nwhos found an obscure disease and wants everyone to have it.",
    "Sacr\u00e9 tonnerre thundered Poirot.",
    "Will you be serious You young people of\ntoday will nothing make you serious It would not have been a joke\nMademoiselle if you had been lying in the hotel garden a pretty little corpse\nwith a nice little hole through your head instead of your hat.",
    "You would not have\nlaughed theneh\nUnearthly laughter heard at a s\u00e9ance said Nick.",
    "But seriously M. Poirotits\nvery kind of you and all thatbut the whole thing must be an accident.",
    "You are as obstinate as the devil\nThats where I got my name from.",
    "My grandfather was popularly supposed to\nhave sold his soul to the devil.",
    "Everyone round here called him Old Nick.",
    "He was\na wicked old manbut great fun.",
    "I adored him.",
    "I went everywhere with him and\nso they called us Old Nick and Young Nick.",
    "My real name is Magdala.",
    "That is an uncommon name.",
    "27\n\n\fYes its a kind of family one.",
    "There have been lots of Magdalas in the Buckley\nfamily.",
    "Theres one up there.",
    "She nodded at a picture on the wall.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "Then looking at a portrait hanging over the mantelpiece he\nsaid Is that your grandfather Mademoiselle\nYes rather an arresting portrait isnt it Jim Lazarus offered to buy it I wouldnt\nsell.",
    "Ive got an affection for Old Nick.",
    "Ah Poirot was silent for a minute then he said very earnestly Revenons \u00e0 nos\nmoutons.",
    "Listen Mademoiselle.",
    "I implore you to be serious.",
    "You are in danger.",
    "Today somebody shot at you with a Mauser pistol\nA Mauser pistol\nFor a moment she was startled.",
    "Yes why Do you know of anyone who has a Mauser pistol\nShe smiled.",
    "Ive got one myself.",
    "You have\nYesit was Dads.",
    "He brought it back from the War.",
    "Its been knocking round\nhere ever since.",
    "I saw it only the other day in that drawer.",
    "She indicated an oldfashioned bureau.",
    "Now as though suddenly struck by an\nidea she crossed to it and pulled the drawer open.",
    "She turned rather blankly.",
    "Her voice held a new note.",
    "Oh she said.",
    "Itsits gone.",
    "28\n\n\fChapter 3\nAccidents\nIt was from that moment that the conversation took on a different tone.",
    "Up to\nnow Poirot and the girl had been at crosspurposes.",
    "They were separated by a\ngulf of years.",
    "His fame and reputation meant nothing to hershe was of the\ngeneration that knows only the great names of the immediate moment.",
    "She\nwas therefore unimpressed by his warnings.",
    "He was to her only a rather comic\nelderly foreigner with an amusingly melodramatic mind.",
    "And this attitude baffled Poirot.",
    "To begin with his vanity suffered.",
    "It was his\nconstant dictum that all the world knew Hercule Poirot.",
    "Here was someone who\ndid not.",
    "Very good for him I could not but feelbut not precisely helpful to the\nobject in view\nWith the discovery of the missing pistol however the affair took on a new\nphase.",
    "Nick ceased to treat it as a mildly amusing joke.",
    "She still treated the\nmatter lightly because it was her habit and her creed to treat all occurrences\nlightly but there was a distinct difference in her manner.",
    "She came back and sat down on the arm of a chair frowning thoughtfully.",
    "Thats odd she said.",
    "Poirot whirled round on me.",
    "You remember Hastings the little idea I mentioned Well it was correct my\nlittle idea Supposing Mademoiselle had been found shot lying in the hotel\ngarden She might not have been found for some hoursfew people pass that\nway.",
    "And beside her hand just fallen from itis her own pistol.",
    "Doubtless the\ngood Madame Ellen would identify it.",
    "There would be suggestions no doubt of\nworry or of sleeplessness\nNick moved uneasily.",
    "Thats true.",
    "I have been worried to death.",
    "Everybodys been telling me Im\nnervy.",
    "Yestheyd say all that...\n29\n\n\fAnd bring in a verdict of suicide.",
    "Mademoiselles fingerprints conveniently on\nthe pistol and nobody elsesbut yes it would be very simple and convincing.",
    "How terribly amusing said Nick but not I was glad to note as though she were\nterribly amused.",
    "Poirot accepted her words in the conventional sense in which they were uttered.",
    "Nest ce pas But you understand Mademoiselle there must be no more of this.",
    "Four failuresyesbut the fifth time there may be a success.",
    "Bring out your rubbertyred hearses murmured Nick.",
    "But we are here my friend and I to obviate all that I felt grateful for the we.",
    "Poirot has a habit of sometimes ignoring my existence.",
    "Yes I put in.",
    "You mustnt be alarmed Miss Buckley.",
    "We will protect you.",
    "How frightfully nice of you said Nick.",
    "I think the whole thing is perfectly\nmarvellous.",
    "Too too thrilling.",
    "She still preserved her airy detached manner but her eyes I thought looked\ntroubled.",
    "And the first thing to do said Poirot is to have the consultation.",
    "He sat down and beamed upon her in a friendly manner.",
    "To begin with Mademoiselle a conventional questionbuthave you any\nenemies\nNick shook her head rather regretfully.",
    "Im afraid not she said apologetically.",
    "Bon.",
    "We will dismiss that possibility then.",
    "And now we ask the question of the\ncinema of the detective novelWho profits by your death Mademoiselle\n\n30\n\n\fI cant imagine said Nick.",
    "Thats why it all seems such nonsense.",
    "Theres this\nbeastly old barn of course but its mortgaged up to the hilt the roof leaks and\nthere cant be a coal mine or anything exciting like that hidden in the cliff.",
    "It is mortgagedhein\nYes.",
    "I had to mortgage it.",
    "You see there were two lots of death dutiesquite\nsoon after each other.",
    "First my grandfather diedjust six years ago and then my\nbrother.",
    "That just about put the lid on the financial position.",
    "And your father\nHe was invalided home from the War then got pneumonia and died in 1919.",
    "My\nmother died when I was a baby.",
    "I lived here with grandfather.",
    "He and Dad didnt\nget on I dont wonder so Dad found it convenient to park me and go roaming\nthe world on his own account.",
    "Geraldthat was my brotherdidnt get on with\ngrandfather either.",
    "I dare say I shouldnt have got on with him if Id been a boy.",
    "Being a girl saved me.",
    "Grandfather used to say I was a chip off the old block and\nhad inherited his spirit.",
    "She laughed.",
    "He was an awful old rip I believe.",
    "But\nfrightfully lucky.",
    "There was a saying round here that everything he touched\nturned to gold.",
    "He was a gambler though and gambled it away again.",
    "When he\ndied he left hardly anything beside the house and land.",
    "I was sixteen when he\ndied and Gerald was twentytwo.",
    "Gerald was killed in a motor accident just three\nyears ago and the place came to me.",
    "And after you Mademoiselle Who is your nearest relation\nMy cousin Charles.",
    "Charles Vyse.",
    "Hes a lawyer down here.",
    "Quite good and\nworthy but very dull.",
    "He gives me good advice and tries to restrain my\nextravagant tastes.",
    "He manages your affairs for youeh\nWellyes if you like to put it that way.",
    "I havent many affairs to manage.",
    "He\narranged the mortgage for me and made me let the lodge.",
    "Ahthe lodge.",

    "Theyre shocked at the way I let the garden go.",
    "Theyre rather a nuisance reallyat least he is.",
    "Too terribly friendly for words.",
    "Shes a cripple poor thing and lies on a sofa all day.",
    "Anyway they pay the rent\nand thats the great thing.",

    "Shes had rotten luck.",
    "The thing was all fixed\nonce.",
    "She got hold of him and put it to him and he said he was perfectly willing\nbut he simply hadnt got the cash to take a woman to a hotel.",

    "He examined the picture and the cord and gingerly\ntested the weight of the painting.",
    "With an elegant grimace he descended.",
    "34\n\n\fTo have that descend on ones headno it would not be pretty.",
    "The cord by\nwhich it was hung Mademoiselle was it like this one a wire cable\nYes but not so thick.",

    "And you examined the breakthe edges were frayed\nI think sobut I didnt notice particularly.",
    "Why should I\nExactly.",
    "As you say why should you All the same I should much like to look at\nthat piece of wire.",
    "Is it about the house anywhere\nIt was still on the picture.",
    "I expect the man who put the new wire on just threw\nthe old one away.",

    "You dont think it was just an accident after all Surely it couldnt have been\nanything else.",
    "It may have been an accident.",
    "It is impossible to say.",
    "But the damage to the\nbrakes of your carthat was not an accident.",
    "And the stone that rolled down the\ncliffI should like to see the spot where that accident occurred.",
    "Nick took us out in the garden and led us to the cliff edge.",
    "The sea glittered blue\nbelow us.",
    "A rough path led down the face of the rock.",
    "Nick described just where\nthe accident occurred and Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Then he asked How\nmany ways are there into your garden Mademoiselle\nTheres the front waypast the lodge.",
    "And a tradesmans entrancea door in the\nwall halfway up that lane.",
    "Then theres a gate just along here on the cliff edge.",
    "It\nleads out on to a zig zag path that leads up from that beach to the Majestic\nHotel.",
    "And then of course you can go straight through a gap in the hedge into\nthe Majestic gardenthats the way I went this morning.",
    "To go through the\nMajestic garden is a short cut to the town anyway.",
    "And your gardenerwhere does he usually work\n\n35\n\n\fWell he usually potters round the kitchen garden or else he sits in the pottingshed and pretends to be sharpening the shears.",
    "Round the other side of the house that is to say\nSo that if anyone were to come in here and dislodge a boulder he would be very\nunlikely to be noticed.",
    "Nick gave a sudden little shiver.",
    "Do youdo you really think that is what happened she asked I cant believe it\nsomehow.",
    "It seems so perfectly futile.",
    "Poirot drew the bullet from his pocket again and looked at it.",
    "That was not futile Mademoiselle he said gently.",
    "It must have been some madman.",
    "Possibly.",
    "It is an interesting subject of afterdinner conversationare all criminals\nreally madmen There may be a malformation in their little grey cellsyes it is\nvery likely.",
    "That it is the affair of the doctor.",
    "For meI have different work to\nperform.",
    "I have the innocent to think of not the guiltythe victim not the\ncriminal.",
    "It is you I am considering now Mademoiselle not your unknown\nassailant.",
    "You are young and beautiful and the sun shines and the world is\npleasant and there is life and love ahead of you.",
    "It is all that of which I think\nMademoiselle.",
    "Tell me these friends of yours Mrs Rice and Mr Lazarusthey\nhave been down here how long\nFreddie came down on Wednesday to this part of the world.",
    "She stopped with\nsome people near Tavistock for a couple of nights.",
    "She came on here yesterday.",
    "Jim has been touring round about I believe.",
    "And Commander Challenger\nHes at Devonport.",
    "He comes over in his car whenever he canweekends\nmostly.",
    "36\n\n\fPoirot nodded.",
    "We were walking back to the house.",
    "There was a silence and\nthen he said suddenly Have you a friend whom you can trust Mademoiselle\nTheres Freddie.",
    "Other than Mrs Rice.",
    "Well I dont know.",
    "I suppose I have.",
    "Why\nBecause I want you to have a friend to stay with youimmediately.",
    "Oh\nNick seemed rather taken aback.",
    "She was silent a moment or two thinking.",
    "Then\nshe said doubtfully Theres Maggie.",
    "I could get hold of her I expect.",
    "Who is Maggie\nOne of my Yorkshire cousins.",
    "Theres a large family of them.",
    "Hes a clergyman\nyou know.",
    "Maggies about my age and I usually have her to stay sometime or\nother in the summer.",
    "Shes no fun thoughone of those painfully pure girls with\nthe kind of hair that has just become fashionable by accident.",
    "I was hoping to get\nout of having her this year.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Your cousin Mademoiselle will do admirably.",
    "Just the type of person\nI had in mind.",
    "All right said Nick with a sigh.",
    "Ill wire her.",
    "I certainly dont know who else I\ncould get hold of just now.",
    "Everyones fixed up.",
    "But if it isnt the Choirboys\nOuting or the Mothers Beanfeast shell come all right.",
    "Though what you expect\nher to do ...\nCould you arrange for her to sleep in your room\nI suppose so.",
    "She would not think that an odd request\n\n37\n\n\fOh no Maggie never thinks.",
    "She just does earnestly you know.",
    "Christian\nworkswith faith and perseverance.",
    "All right Ill wire her to come on Monday.",
    "Why not tomorrow\nWith Sunday trains Shell think Im dying if I suggest that.",
    "No Ill say Monday.",
    "Are you going to tell her about the awful fate hanging over me\nNous verrons.",
    "You still make a jest of it You have courage I am glad to see.",
    "It makes a diversion anyway said Nick.",
    "Something in her tone struck me and I glanced at her curiously.",
    "I had a feeling\nthat there was something she had left untold.",
    "We had reentered the drawingroom.",
    "Poirot was fingering the newspaper on the sofa.",
    "You read this Mademoiselle he asked suddenly.",
    "The St Loo Herald  Not seriously.",
    "I opened it to see the tides.",
    "It gives them\nevery week.",
    "I see.",
    "By the way Mademoiselle have you ever made a will\nYes I did.",
    "About six months ago.",
    "Just before my op.",
    "Quest ce que vous dites Your op\nOperation.",
    "For appendicitis.",
    "Someone said I ought to make a will so I did.",
    "It\nmade me feel quite important.",
    "And the terms of that will\nI left End House to Charles.",
    "I hadnt much else to leave but what there was I left\nto Freddie.",
    "I should think probably thewhat do you call themliabilities would\nhave exceeded the assets really.",
    "Poirot nodded absently.",
    "I will take my leave now.",
    "Au revoir Mademoiselle.",
    "Be careful.",
    "38\n\n\fWhat of asked Nick.",
    "You are intelligent.",
    "Yes that is the weak pointin which direction are you to be\ncareful Who can say But have confidence Mademoiselle.",
    "In a few days I shall\nhave discovered the truth.",
    "Until then beware of poison bombs revolver shots motor accidents and arrows\ndipped in the secret poison of the South American Indians finished Nick glibly.",
    "Do not mock yourself Mademoiselle said Poirot gravely.",
    "He paused as he reached the door.",
    "By the way he said.",
    "What price did M. Lazarus offer you for the portrait of your\ngrandfather\nFifty pounds.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "He looked earnestly back at the dark saturnine face above the mantelpiece.",
    "But as I told you I dont want to sell the old boy.",
    "No said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "No I understand.",
    "39\n\n\f40\n\n\fChapter 4\nThere Must Be Something\nPoirot I said as soon as we were out upon the road.",
    "There is one thing I think\nyou ought to know.",
    "And what is that mon ami\nI told him of Mrs Rices version of the trouble with the motor.",
    "Tiens Cest int\u00e9ressant \u00e7a.",
    "There is of course a type vain hysterical that\nseeks to make itself interesting by having marvellous escapes from death and\nwhich will recount to you surprising histories that never happened Yes it is well\nknown that type there.",
    "Such people will even do themselves grave bodily injury\nto sustain the fiction.",
    "You dont think that\nThat Mademoiselle Nick is of that type No indeed.",
    "You observed Hastings\nthat we had great difficulty in convincing her of her danger.",
    "And right to the end\nshe kept up the farce of a halfmocking disbelief.",
    "She is of her generation that\nlittle one.",
    "All the same it is interestingwhat Madame Rice said.",
    "Why should she\nsay it Why say it even if it were true It was unnecessaryalmost gauche.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "Thats true.",
    "She dragged it into the conversation neck and cropfor\nno earthly reason that I could see.",
    "That is curious.",
    "Yes that is curious.",
    "The little facts that are curious I like to see\nthem appear.",
    "They are significant.",
    "They point the way.",
    "The waywhere\nYou put your finger on the weak spot my excellent Hastings.",
    "Where Where\nindeed Alas we shall not know till we get there.",
    "Tell me Poirot I said.",
    "Why did you insist on her getting this cousin to stay\nPoirot stopped and waved an excited forefinger at me.",
    "41\n\n\fConsider he cried.",
    "Consider for one little moment Hastings.",
    "How we are\nhandicapped How are our hands tied To hunt down a murderer after a crime\nhas been committedcest tout simple Or at least it is simple to one of my\nability.",
    "The murderer has so to speak signed his name by committing the crime.",
    "But here there is no crimeand what is more we do not want a crime.",
    "To detect a\ncrime before it has been committedthat is indeed of a rare difficulty.",
    "What is our first aim The safety of Mademoiselle.",
    "And that is not easy.",
    "No it is\nnot easy Hastings.",
    "We cannot watch over her day and nightwe cannot even\nsend a policeman in big boots to watch over her.",
    "We cannot pass the night in a\nyoung ladys sleeping chamber.",
    "The affair bristles with difficulties.",
    "But we can do one thing.",
    "We can make it more difficult for our assassin.",
    "We can\nput Mademoiselle upon her guard and we can introduce a perfectly impartial\nwitness.",
    "It will take a very clever man to get round those two circumstances.",
    "He paused and then said in an entirely different tone of voice But what I am\nafraid of Hastings\nYes\nWhat I am afraid of isthat he is a very clever man.",
    "And I am not easy in my\nmind.",
    "No I am not easy at all.",
    "Poirot I said.",
    "Youre making me feel quite nervous.",
    "So am I nervous.",
    "Listen my friend that paper the St Loo Weekly Herald.",
    "It was\nopen and folded back atwhere do you think A little paragraph which said\nAmong the guests staying at the Majestic Hotel are M. Hercule Poirot and\nCaptain Hastings.",
    "Supposingjust supposing that someone had read that\nparagraph.",
    "They know my nameeveryone knows my name\nMiss Buckley didnt I said with a grin.",
    "She is a scatterbrainshe does not count.",
    "A serious mana criminalwould know\nmy name.",
    "And he would be afraid He would wonder He would ask himself\nquestions.",
    "Three times he has attempted the life of Mademoiselle and now\nHercule Poirot arrives in the neighbourhood.",
    "Is that coincidence he would ask\n42\n\n\fhimself.",
    "And he would fear that it might not be coincidence.",
    "What would he do\nthen\nLie low and hide his tracks I suggested.",
    "Yesyesor elseif he had real audacity he would strike quickly without loss of\ntime.",
    "Before I had time to make inquiriespouf Mademoiselle is dead.",
    "That is\nwhat a man of audacity would do.",
    "But why do you think that somebody read that paragraph other than Miss\nBuckley\nIt was not Miss Buckley who read that paragraph.",
    "When I mentioned my name it\nmeant nothing to her.",
    "It was not even familiar.",
    "Her face did not change.",
    "Besides\nshe told usshe opened the paper to look at the tidesnothing else.",
    "Well there\nwas no tide table on that page.",
    "You think someone in the house\nSomeone in the house or who has access to it.",
    "And that last is easythe window\nstands open.",
    "Without doubt Miss Buckleys friends pass in and out.",
    "Have you any idea Any suspicion\nPoirot flung out his hands.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Whatever the motive it is as I predicted not an obvious one.",
    "That is\nthe wouldbe murderers securitythat is why he could act so daringly this\nmorning.",
    "On the face of it no one seems to have any reason for desiring the\nlittle Nicks death.",
    "The property End House That passes to the cousinbut does\nhe particularly want a heavily mortgaged and very dilapidated old house It is\nnot even a family place so far as he is concerned.",
    "He is not a Buckley remember.",
    "We must see this Charles Vyse certainly but the idea seems fantastic.",
    "Then there is Madamethe bosom friendwith her strange eyes and her air of a\nlost Madonna\nYou felt that too I asked startled.",
    "43\n\n\fWhat is her concern in the business She tells you that her friend is a liar.",
    "Cest\ngentil \u00e7a Why does she tell you Is she afraid of something that Nick may say\nIs that something connected with the car Or did she use that as an instance\nand was her real fear of something else Did anyone tamper with the car and if\nso who And does she know about it\nThen the handsome blond M. Lazarus.",
    "Where does he fit in With his\nmarvellous automobile and his money.",
    "Can he possibly be concerned in any\nway Commander Challenger\nHes all right I put in quickly.",
    "Im sure of that.",
    "A real pukka sahib.",
    "Doubtless he has been to what you consider the right school.",
    "Happily being a\nforeigner I am free from these prejudices and can make investigations\nunhampered by them.",
    "But I will admit that I find it hard to connect Commander\nChallenger with the case.",
    "In fact I do not see that he can be connected.",
    "Of course he cant I said warmly.",
    "Poirot looked at me meditatively.",
    "You have an extraordinary effect on me Hastings.",
    "You have so strongly the flair\nin the wrong direction that I am almost tempted to go by it You are that wholly\nadmirable type of man honest credulous honourable who is invariably taken in\nby any scoundrel.",
    "You are the type of man who invests in doubtful oil fields and\nnonexistent gold mines.",
    "From hundreds like you the swindler makes his daily\nbread.",
    "Ah wellI shall study this Commander Challenger.",
    "You have awakened my\ndoubts.",
    "My dear Poirot I cried angrily.",
    "You are perfectly absurd.",
    "A man who has\nknocked about the world like I have\nNever learns said Poirot sadly.",
    "It is amazingbut there it is.",
    "Do you suppose Id have made a success of my ranch out in the Argentine if I\nwere the kind of credulous fool you make out\n\n44\n\n\fDo not enrage yourself mon ami.",
    "You have made a great success of ityou and\nyour wife.",
    "Bella I said always goes by my judgement.",
    "She is as wise as she is charming said Poirot.",
    "Let us not quarrel my friend.",
    "See\nthere ahead of us it says Motts Garage.",
    "That I think is the garage mentioned\nby Mademoiselle Buckley.",
    "A few inquiries will soon give us the truth of that little\nmatter.",
    "We duly entered the place and Poirot introduced himself by explaining that he\nhad been recommended there by Miss Buckley.",
    "He made some inquiries about\nhiring a car for some afternoon drives and from there slid easily into the topic of\nthe damage sustained by Miss Buckleys car not long ago.",
    "Immediately the garage proprietor waxed voluble.",
    "Most extraordinary thing hed\never seen.",
    "He proceeded to be technical.",
    "I alas am not mechanically minded.",
    "Poirot I should imagine is even less so.",
    "But certain facts did emerge\nunmistakably.",
    "The car had been tampered with.",
    "And the damage had been\nsomething quite easily done occupying very little time.",
    "So that is that said Poirot as we strolled away.",
    "The little Nick was right and\nthe rich M. Lazarus was wrong.",
    "Hastings my friend all this is very interesting.",
    "What do we do now\nWe visit the post office and send off a telegram if it is not too late.",
    "A telegram I said hopefully.",
    "Yes said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "A telegram.",
    "The post office was still open.",
    "Poirot wrote out his telegram and despatched it.",
    "He vouchsafed me no information as to its contents.",
    "Feeling that he wanted me\nto ask him I carefully refrained from doing so.",
    "It is annoying that tomorrow is Sunday he remarked as we strolled back to the\nhotel.",
    "We cannot now call upon M. Vyse till Monday morning.",
    "45\n\n\fYou could get hold of him at his private address.",
    "Naturally.",
    "But that is just what I am anxious not to do.",
    "I would prefer in the first\nplace to consult him professionally and to form my judgement of him from that\naspect.",
    "Yes I said thoughtfully.",
    "I suppose that would be best.",
    "The answer to one simple little question for instance might make a great\ndifference.",
    "If M. Charles Vyse was in his office at twelvethirty this morning then\nit was not he who fired that shot in the garden of the Majestic Hotel.",
    "Ought we not to examine the alibis of the three at the hotel\nThat is much more difficult.",
    "It would be easy enough for one of them to leave\nthe others for a few minutes a hasty egress from one of the innumerable\nwindowslounge smokingroom drawingroom writingroom quickly under\ncover to the spot where the girl must passthe shot fired and a rapid retreat.",
    "But\nas yet mon ami we are not even sure that we have arrived at all the dramatis\npersonae in the drama.",
    "There is the respectable Ellenand her so far unseen\nhusband.",
    "Both inmates of the house and possibly for all we know with a grudge\nagainst our little Mademoiselle.",
    "There are even the unknown Australians at the\nlodge.",
    "And there may be others friends and intimates of Miss Buckleys whom\nshe has no reason for suspecting and consequently has not mentioned.",
    "I cannot\nhelp feeling Hastings that there is something behind thissomething that has\nnot yet come to light.",
    "I have a little idea that Miss Buckley knows more than she\ntold us.",
    "You think she is keeping something back\nYes.",
    "Possibly with an idea of shielding whoever it is\nPoirot shook his head with the utmost energy.",
    "No no.",
    "As far as that goes she gave me the impression of being utterly frank.",
    "I\nam convinced that as regards these attempts on her life she was telling all she\n46\n\n\fknew.",
    "But there is something elsesomething that she believes has nothing to do\nwith that at all.",
    "And I should like to know what that something is.",
    "For II say it in\nall modestyam a great deal more intelligent thanune petite comme \u00e7a .",
    "I\nHercule Poirot might see a connection where she sees none.",
    "It might give me\nthe clue I am seeking.",
    "For I announce to you Hastings quite frankly and humbly\nthat I am as you express it all on the sea.",
    "Until I can get some glimmering of the\nreason behind all this I am in the dark.",
    "There must be something some factor in\nthe case that I do not grasp.",
    "What is it Je me demande \u00e7a sans cesse.",
    "Questce\nque cest \nYou will find out I said soothingly.",
    "So long he said sombrely as I do not find out too late.",
    "47\n\n\f48\n\n\fChapter 5\nMr and Mrs Croft\nThere was dancing that evening at the hotel.",
    "Nick Buckley dined there with her\nfriends and waved a gay greeting to us.",
    "She was dressed that evening in floating scarlet chiffon that dragged on the\nfloor.",
    "Out of it rose her white neck and shoulders and her small impudent dark\nhead.",
    "An engaging young devil I remarked.",
    "A contrast to her friendeh\nFrederica Rice was in white.",
    "She danced with a languorous weary grace that was\nas far removed from Nicks animation as anything could be.",
    "She is very beautiful said Poirot suddenly.",
    "Who Our Nick\nNothe other.",
    "Is she evil Is she good Is she merely unhappy One cannot tell.",
    "She is a mystery.",
    "She is perhaps nothing at all.",
    "But I tell you my friend she is\nanallumeuse.",
    "What do you mean I asked curiously.",
    "He shook his head smiling.",
    "You will feel it sooner or later.",
    "Remember my words.",
    "Presently to my surprise he rose.",
    "Nick was dancing with George Challenger.",
    "Frederica and Lazarus had just stopped and had sat down at their table.",
    "Then\nLazarus got up and went away.",
    "Mrs Rice was alone.",
    "Poirot went straight to her\ntable.",
    "I followed him.",
    "His methods were direct and to the point.",
    "49\n\n\fYou permit He laid a hand on the back of a chair then slid into it.",
    "I am anxious\nto have a word with you while your friend is dancing.",
    "Yes Her voice sounded cool uninterested.",
    "Madame I do not know whether your friend has told you.",
    "If not I will.",
    "Today\nher life has been attempted.",
    "Her great grey eyes widened in horror and surprise.",
    "The pupils dilated black\npupils widened too.",
    "What do you mean\nMademoiselle Buckley was shot at in the garden of this hotel.",
    "She smiled suddenlya gentle pitying incredulous smile.",
    "Did Nick tell you so\nNo Madame I happened to see it with my own eyes.",
    "Here is the bullet.",
    "He held it out to her and she drew back a little.",
    "But thenbut then\nIt is no fantasy of Mademoiselles imagination you understand.",
    "I vouch for that.",
    "And there is more.",
    "Several very curious accidents have happened in the last few\ndays.",
    "You will have heardno perhaps you will not.",
    "You only arrived yesterday\ndid you not\nYesyesterday.",
    "Before that you were staying with friends I understand.",
    "At Tavistock.",
    "Yes.",
    "I wonder Madame what were the names of the friends with whom you were\nstaying.",
    "She raised her eyebrows.",
    "50\n\n\fIs there any reason why I should tell you that she asked coldly.",
    "Poirot was immediately all innocent surprise.",
    "A thousand pardons Madame.",
    "I was most maladroit.",
    "But I myself having\nfriends at Tavistock fancied that you might have met them there... Buchananthat is the name of my friends.",

    "I dont remember them.",
    "I dont think I can have met them.",
    "Her tone now was\nquite cordial.",

    "I will.",
    "That is all.",

    "At any rate one thing emerges plain to see.",
    "What is that\n51\n\n\fMrs Rice was not at Tavistock.",
    "Where was she Ah but I will find out.",
    "Impossible to keep information from Hercule Poirot.",

    "What I shall know on Monday he returned ambiguously.",
    "I looked at him but said nothing.",
    "He sighed.",
    "You have no longer the curiosity my friend.",
    "In the old days\nThere are some pleasures I said coldly that it is good for you to do without.",
    "You mean\nThe pleasure of refusing to answer questions.",
    "Ah cest malin.",
    "Quite so.",
    "Ah well well murmured Poirot.",
    "The strong silent man beloved of novelists in\nthe Edwardian age.",
    "His eyes twinkled with their old glint.",
    "Nick passed our table shortly afterwards.",
    "She detached herself from her partner\nand swooped down on us like a gailycoloured bird.",
    "Dancing on the edge of death she said lightly.",
    "It is a new sensation Mademoiselle\nYes.",
    "Rather fun.",
    "She was off again with a wave of her hand.",
    "I wish she hadnt said that I said slowly.",
    "52\n\n\fDancing on the edge of death.",
    "I dont like it.",
    "I know.",
    "It is too near the truth.",
    "She has courage that little one.",

    "But unfortunately it is not courage that is needed at this moment.",
    "Caution not couragevoil\u00e0ce quil nous faut\nThe following day was Sunday.",

    "Come my friend.",
    "We will try a little experiment.",
    "I have ascertained that M.\nLazarus and Madame have gone out in the car and Mademoiselle with them.",
    "The\ncoast is clear.",
    "Clear for what\nYou shall see.",
    "We walked down the steps and across a short stretch of grass to the sea.",
    "A\ncouple of bathers were coming up it.",
    "They passed us laughing and talking.",
    "When they had gone Poirot walked to the point where an inconspicuous small\ngate rather rusty on its hinges bore the words in half obliterated letters End\nHouse.",
    "Private.",
    "There was no one in sight.",
    "We passed quietly through.",
    "In another minute we came out on the stretch of lawn in front of the house.",
    "There was no one about.",
    "Poirot strolled to the edge of the cliff and looked over.",
    "Then he walked towards the house itself.",
    "The French windows on to the\nverandah were open and we passed straight into the drawingroom.",
    "Poirot\nwasted no time there.",
    "He opened the door and went out into the hall.",
    "From\nthere he mounted the stairs I at his heels.",
    "He went straight to Nicks bedroomsat down on the edge of the bed and nodded to me with a twinkle.",
    "You see my friend how easy it is.",
    "No one has seen us come.",
    "No one will see us\ngo.",
    "We could do any little affair we had to do in perfect safety.",

    "It is no stray lunatic who is at the bottom of this.",
    "We must look nearer home than that.",
    "He turned to leave the room and I followed him.",
    "We neither of us spoke.",
    "We\nwere both I think troubled in mind.",
    "And then at the bend of the staircase we both stopped abruptly.",
    "A man was\ncoming up.",
    "He too stopped.",
    "His face was in shadow but his attitude was one of one\ncompletely taken aback.",
    "He was the first to speak in a loud rather bullying\nvoice.",
    "What the hell are you doing here Id like to know\nAh said Poirot.",
    "MonsieurCroft I think\nThats my name but what\nShall we go into the drawingroom to converse It would be better I think.",
    "The other gave way turned abruptly and descended we following close on his\nheels.",
    "In the drawingroom with the door shut Poirot made a little bow.",
    "I will introduce myself.",
    "Hercule Poirot at your service.",
    "The others face cleared a little.",
    "Oh he said slowly.",

    "His physique was magnificent.",
    "He had a heavy rather underhung facea crude face I called it to myself.",
    "The piercing blue of his eyes was the\nmost noticeable thing about him.",

    "That struck me as odd.",
    "We dont deal\nmuch in burglars round herebut after all it was possible.",
    "I thought Id just make\nsure everything was all right.",
    "Then I met you two on the stairs coming down.",
    "It\ngave me a bit of a surprise.",
    "And now you tell me youre a bonza detective.",
    "Whats it all about\nIt is very simple said Poirot smiling.",

    "I assured him that I had the measurements correctly and we accompanied our\nnew friend.",
    "Croft was a talker we soon realized that.",
    "He told us of his home near\nMelbourne of his early struggles of his meeting with his wife of their combined\nefforts and of his final good fortune and success.",

    "Typical Australians.",
    "You liked them\nDidnt you\nThey were very pleasantvery friendly.",
    "Well what is it then Theres something I can see.",
    "They were perhaps just a shade too typical said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "That\ncry of Cooeethat insistence on showing us snapshotswas it not playing a part\njust a little too thoroughly\nWhat a suspicious old devil you are\nYou are right mon ami.",
    "I am suspicious of everyoneof everything.",

    "59\n\n\f60\n\n\fChapter 6\nA Call Upon Mr Vyse\nPoirot clung firmly to the Continental breakfast.",
    "To see me consuming eggs and\nbacon upset and distressed himso he always said.",
    "Consequently he breakfasted\nin bed upon coffee and rolls and I was free to start the day with the traditional\nEnglishmans breakfast of bacon and eggs and marmalade.",
    "I looked into his room on Monday morning as I went downstairs.",
    "He was sitting\nup in bed arrayed in a very marvellous dressinggown.",
    "Bonjour Hastings.",
    "I was just about to ring.",
    "This note that I have written will you\nbe so good as to get it taken over to End House and delivered to Mademoiselle\nat once.",
    "I held out my hand for it.",
    "Poirot looked at me and sighed.",
    "If onlyif only Hastings you would part your hair in the middle instead of at the\nside What a difference it would make to the symmetry of your appearance.",
    "And\nyour moustache.",
    "If you must have a moustache let it be a real moustachea\nthing of beauty such as mine.",

    "In her hand she held a telegram which she handed to Poirot.",
    "There she said.",
    "I hope that will please you\nPoirot read it aloud.",
    "Arrive 5.30 today.",
    "Maggie.",
    "61\n\n\fMy nurse and guardian said Nick.",
    "But youre wrong you know.",
    "Maggies got\nno kind of brains.",
    "Good works is about all shes fit for.",
    "That and never seeing the\npoint of jokes.",
    "Freddie would be ten times better at spotting hidden assassins.",
    "And Jim Lazarus would be better still.",
    "I never feel one has got to the bottom of\nJim.",
    "And the Commander Challenger\nOh George Hed never see anything till it was under his nose.",
    "But hed let them\nhave it when he did see.",
    "Very useful when it came to a showdown George\nwould be.",
    "She tossed off her hat and went on I gave orders for the man you wrote about\nto be let in.",
    "It sounds mysterious.",
    "Is he installing a dictaphone or something like\nthat\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "No no nothing scientific.",
    "A very simple little matter of opinion Mademoiselle.",
    "Something I wanted to know.",
    "Oh well said Nick.",
    "Its all great fun isnt it\nIs it Mademoiselle asked Poirot gently.",
    "She stood for a minute with her back to us looking out of the window.",
    "Then she\nturned.",
    "All the brave defiance had gone out of her face.",
    "It was childishly twisted\nawry as she struggled to keep back the tears.",
    "No she said.",
    "Itit isnt really.",
    "Im afraidIm afraid.",
    "Hideously afraid.",
    "And I\nalways thought I was brave.",

    "Itsits the waiting.",
    "Wondering\nthe whole time if anything mores going to happen.",
    "And how itll happen And\nexpecting it to happen.",
    "Yes yesit is the strain.",
    "Last night I pulled my bed out into the middle of the room.",
    "And fastened my\nwindow and bolted my door.",
    "When I came here this morning I came round by\nthe road.",
    "I couldntI simply couldnt come through the garden.",
    "Its as though my\nnerve had gone all of a sudden.",
    "Its this thing coming on top of everything else.",
    "What do you mean exactly by that Mademoiselle On top of everything else\nThere was a momentary pause before she replied.",
    "I dont mean anything particular.",
    "What the newspapers call the strain of\nmodern life I suppose.",
    "Too many cocktails too many cigarettesall that sort of\nthing.",
    "Its just that Ive got into a ridiculoussort ofof state.",
    "She had sunk into a chair and was sitting there her small fingers curling and\nuncurling themselves nervously.",
    "You are not being frank with me Mademoiselle.",
    "There is something.",
    "There isntthere really isnt.",
    "There is something you have not told me.",
    "Ive told you every single smallest thing.",
    "She spoke sincerely and earnestly.",
    "About these accidentsabout the attacks upon you yes.",
    "Wellthen\nBut you have not told me everything that is in your heartin your life...\nShe said slowly Can anyone do that...\n63\n\n\fAh then said Poirot with triumph.",
    "You admit it\nShe shook her head.",
    "He watched her keenly.",
    "Perhaps he suggested shrewdly.",
    "It is not your secret\nI thought I saw a momentary flicker of her eyelids.",
    "But almost immediately she\njumped up.",
    "Really and truly M. Poirot Ive told you every single thing I know about this\nstupid business.",
    "If you think I know something about someone else or have\nsuspicions you are wrong.",
    "Its having no suspicions thats driving me mad\nBecause Im not a fool.",
    "I can see that if those accidents werent accidents they\nmust have been engineered by somebody very near at handsomebody whoknows me.",
    "And thats what is so awful.",
    "Because I havent the least ideanot the\nvery leastwho that somebody might be.",
    "She went over once more to the window and stood looking out.",
    "Poirot signed to\nme not to speak.",
    "I think he was hoping for some further revelation now that the\ngirls selfcontrol had broken down.",
    "When she spoke it was in a different tone of voice a dreamy faraway voice.",
    "Do you know a queer wish Ive always had I love End House.",
    "Ive always wanted\nto produce a play there.",
    "Its got anan atmosphere of drama about it.",
    "Ive seen\nall sorts of plays staged there in my mind.",
    "And now its as though a drama were\nbeing acted there.",
    "Only Im not producing it... Im in it Im right in it I am\nperhaps the person whodies in the first act.",
    "Her voice broke.",
    "Now now Mademoiselle.",
    "Poirots voice was resolutely brisk and cheerful.",
    "This\nwill not do.",
    "This is hysteria.",
    "She turned and looked at him sharply.",
    "64\n\n\fDid Freddie tell you I was hysterical she asked.",
    "She says I am sometimes.",
    "But\nyou mustnt always believe what Freddie says.",
    "There are times you know whenwhen she isnt quite herself.",
    "There was a pause then Poirot asked a totally irrelevant question Tell me\nMademoiselle he said.",
    "Have you ever received an offer for End House\nTo sell it do you mean\nThat is what I meant.",
    "No.",
    "Would you consider selling it if you got a good offer\nNick considered for a moment.",
    "No I dont think so.",
    "Not I mean unless it was such a ridiculously good offer that\nit would be perfectly foolish not to.",
    "Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment.",
    "I dont want to sell it you know because Im fond of it.",
    "Quite so.",
    "I understand.",
    "Nick moved slowly towards the door.",
    "By the way there are fireworks tonight.",
    "Will you come Dinner at eight oclock.",
    "The fireworks begin at ninethirty.",
    "You can see them splendidly from the garden\nwhere it overlooks the harbour.",
    "I shall be enchanted.",
    "Both of you of course said Nick.",
    "Many thanks I said.",
    "Nothing like a party for reviving the drooping spirits remarked Nick.",
    "And with a\nlittle laugh she went out.",
    "65\n\n\fPauvre enfant said Poirot.",
    "He reached for his hat and carefully flicked an infinitesimal speck of dust from its\nsurface.",
    "We are going out I asked.",
    "Mais oui we have legal business to transact mon ami.",
    "Of course.",
    "I understand.",
    "One of your brilliant mentality could not fail to do so Hastings.",
    "The offices of Messrs Vyse Trevannion  Wynnard were situated in the main\nstreet of the town.",
    "We mounted the stairs to the first floor and entered a room\nwhere three clerks were busily writing.",
    "Poirot asked to see Mr Charles Vyse.",
    "A clerk murmured a few words down a telephone received apparently an\naffirmative reply and remarking that Mr Vyse would see us now he led us\nacross the passage tapped on a door and stood aside for us to pass in.",
    "From behind a large desk covered with legal papers Mr Vyse rose up to greet us.",
    "He was a tall young man rather pale with impassive features.",
    "He was going a\nlittle bald on either temple and wore glasses.",
    "His colouring was fair and\nindeterminate.",
    "Poirot had come prepared for the encounter.",
    "Fortunately he had with him an\nagreement as yet unsigned and so on some technical points in connection with\nthis he wanted Mr Vyses advice.",
    "Mr Vyse speaking carefully and correctly was soon able to allay Poirots alleged\ndoubts and to clear up some obscure points of the wording.",
    "I am very much obliged to you murmured Poirot.",
    "As a foreigner you\ncomprehend these legal matters and phrasing are most difficult.",
    "It was then that Mr Vyse asked who had sent Poirot to him.",
    "66\n\n\fMiss Buckley said Poirot promptly.",
    "Your cousin is she not A most charming\nyoung lady.",
    "I happened to mention that I was in perplexity and she told me to\ncome to you.",
    "I tried to see you on Saturday morningabout halfpast twelvebut\nyou were out.",
    "Yes I remember.",
    "I left early on Saturday.",
    "Mademoiselle your cousin must find that large house very lonely She lives\nthere alone I understand.",
    "Quite so.",
    "Tell me Mr Vyse if I may ask is there any chance of that property being in the\nmarket\nNot the least I should say.",
    "You understand I do not ask idly.",
    "I have a reason I am in search myself of just\nsuch a property.",
    "The climate of St Loo enchants me.",
    "It is true that the house\nappears to be in bad repair there has not been I gather much money to spend\nupon it.",
    "Under those circumstances is it not possible that Mademoiselle would\nconsider an offer\nNot the least likelihood of it.",
    "Charles Vyse shook his head with the utmost\ndecision.",
    "My cousin is absolutely devoted to the place.",
    "Nothing would induce\nher to sell I know.",
    "It is you understand a family place.",
    "I comprehend that but\nIt is absolutely out of the question.",
    "I know my cousin.",
    "She has a fanatical\ndevotion to the house.",
    "A few minutes later we were out in the street again.",
    "Well my friend said Poirot.",
    "And what impression did this M. Charles Vyse\nmake upon you\nI considered.",
    "67\n\n\fA very negative one I said at last.",
    "He is a curiously negative person.",
    "Not a strong personality you would say\nNo indeed.",
    "The kind of man you would never remember on meeting him again.",
    "A mediocre person.",
    "His appearance is certainly not striking.",
    "Did you notice any discrepancy in the\ncourse of our conversation with him\nYes I said slowly I did.",
    "With regard to the selling of End House.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Would you have described Mademoiselle Buckleys attitude towards\nEnd House as one of fanatical devotion\nIt is a very strong term.",
    "Yesand Mr Vyse is not given to using strong terms.",
    "His normal attitudea legal\nattitudeis to under rather than over state.",
    "Yet he says that Mademoiselle has a\nfanatical devotion to the home of her ancestors.",
    "She did not convey that impression this morning I said.",
    "She spoke about it very\nsensibly I thought.",
    "Shes obviously fond of the placejust as anyone in her\nposition would bebut certainly nothing more.",
    "So in fact one of the two is lying said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "One would not suspect Vyse of lying.",
    "Clearly a great asset if one has any lying to do remarked Poirot.",
    "Yes he has\nquite the air of a George Washington that one.",
    "Did you notice another thing\nHastings\nWhat was that\nHe was not in his office at halfpast twelve on Saturday.",
    "68\n\n\fChapter 7\nTragedy\nThe first person we saw when we arrived at End House that evening was Nick.",
    "She was dancing about the hall wrapped in a marvellous kimono covered with\ndragons.",
    "Oh its only you\nMademoiselleI am desolated\nI know.",
    "It did sound rude.",
    "But you see Im waiting for my dress to arrive.",
    "They\npromisedthe brutespromised faithfully\nAh if it is a matter of la toilette  There is a dance tonight is there not\nYes.",
    "We are all going on to it after the fireworks.",
    "That is I suppose we are.",
    "There was a sudden drop in her voice.",
    "But the next minute she was laughing.",
    "Never give in Thats my motto.",
    "Dont think of trouble and trouble wont come\nIve got my nerve back tonight.",
    "Im going to be gay and enjoy myself.",
    "There was a footfall on the stairs.",
    "Nick turned.",
    "Oh heres Maggie.",
    "Maggie here are the sleuths that are protecting me from\nthe secret assassin.",
    "Take them into the drawingroom and let them tell you\nabout it.",
    "In turn we shook hands with Maggie Buckley and as requested she took us into\nthe drawingroom.",
    "I formed an immediate favourable opinion of her.",
    "It was I think her appearance of calm good sense that so attracted me.",
    "A quiet\ngirl pretty in the oldfashioned sensecertainly not smart.",
    "Her face was innocent\nof makeup and she wore a simple rather shabby black evening dress.",
    "She had\nfrank blue eyes and a pleasant slow voice.",
    "69\n\n\fNick has been telling me the most amazing things she said.",
    "Surely she must be\nexaggerating Who ever would want to harm Nick She cant have an enemy in\nthe world.",
    "Incredulity showed strongly in her voice.",
    "She was looking at Poirot in a\nsomewhat unflattering fashion.",
    "I realized that to a girl like Maggie Buckley\nforeigners were always suspicious.",
    "Nevertheless Miss Buckley I assure you that it is the truth said Poirot quietly.",
    "She made no reply but her face remained unbelieving.",
    "Nick seems quite fey tonight she remarked.",
    "I dont know whats the matter\nwith her.",
    "She seems in the wildest spirits.",
    "That wordfey It sent a shiver through me.",
    "Also something in the intonation of\nher voice had set me wondering.",
    "Are you Scotch Miss Buckley I asked abruptly.",
    "My mother was Scottish she explained.",
    "She viewed me I noticed with more approval than she viewed Poirot.",
    "I felt that\nmy statement of the case would carry more weight with her than Poirots would.",
    "Your cousin is behaving with great bravery I said.",
    "Shes determined to carry on\nas usual.",
    "Its the only way isnt it said Maggie.",
    "I meanwhatever ones inward feelings\nareit is no good making a fuss about them.",
    "Thats only uncomfortable for\neveryone else.",
    "She paused and then added in a soft voice Im very fond of Nick.",
    "Shes been good to me always.",
    "We could say nothing more for at that moment Frederica Rice drifted into the\nroom.",
    "She was wearing a gown of Madonna blue and looked very fragile and\nethereal.",
    "Lazarus soon followed her and then Nick danced in.",
    "She was wearing a\nblack frock and round her was wrapped a marvellous old Chinese shawl of vivid\nlacquer red.",
    "70\n\n\fHello people she said.",
    "Cocktails\nWe all drank and Lazarus raised his glass to her.",
    "Thats a marvellous shawl Nick he said.",
    "Its an old one isnt it\nYesbrought back by GreatGreatGreatUncle Timothy from his travels.",
    "Its a beautya real beauty.",
    "You wouldnt find another to match it if you tried.",
    "Its warm said Nick.",
    "Itll be nice when were watching the fireworks.",
    "And its\ngay.",
    "II hate black.",
    "Yes said Frederica.",

    "She looked like a meditative angel.",
    "It was just twenty past nine when Nick put her head round the door.",
    "Come out of it all of you The animals are coming in two by two.",
    "We rose obediently.",
    "Nick was busy greeting arrivals.",
    "About a dozen people had\nbeen asked.",

    "She sank her modernisms and made everyone welcome in an oldfashioned way.",
    "Among the guests I noticed Charles Vyse.",
    "73\n\n\fPresently we all moved out into the garden to a place overlooking the sea and\nthe harbour.",
    "A few chairs had been placed there for the elderly people but most\nof us stood.",
    "The first rocket flamed to Heaven.",
    "At that moment I heard a loud familiar voice and turned my head to see Nick\ngreeting Mr Croft.",
    "Its too bad she was saying that Mrs Croft cant be here too.",
    "We ought to have\ncarried her on a stretcher or something.",
    "Its bad luck on poor mother altogether.",

    "It was also like most summer evenings cold.",
    "Maggie Buckley who\nwas next to me shivered.",
    "Ill just run in and get a coat she murmured.",
    "Let me.",
    "No you wouldnt know where to find it.",
    "She turned towards the house.",

    "They changed to blue then red\nthen silver.",
    "74\n\n\fAnother and yet another.",
    "Oh and then Ah that is what one says observed Poirot suddenly close to\nmy ear.",
    "At the end it becomes monotonous do you not find Brrr The grass it\nis damp to the feet I shall suffer for thisa chill.",
    "And no possibility of obtaining a\npropertisane\nA chill On a lovely night like this\nA lovely night A lovely night You say that because the rain it does not pour\ndown in sheets Always when the rain does not fall it is a lovely night.",
    "But I tell\nyou my friend if there were a little thermometer to consult you would see.",
    "Well I admitted I wouldnt mind putting on a coat myself.",
    "You are very sensible.",
    "You have come from a hot climate.",
    "Ill bring yours.",
    "Poirot lifted first one then the other foot from the ground with a catlike\nmotion.",
    "It is the dampness of the feet I fear.",
    "Would it think you be possible to lay hands\non a pair of goloshes\nI repressed a smile.",
    "Not a hope I said.",
    "You understand Poirot that it is no longer done.",
    "Then I shall sit in the house he declared.",
    "Just for the Guy Fawkes show shall I\nwant only enrhumer myself And catch perhaps afluxion de poitrine\nPoirot still murmuring indignantly we bent our footsteps towards the house.",
    "Loud clapping drifted up to us from the quay below where another set piece was\nbeing showna ship I believe with Welcome to Our Visitors displayed across it.",
    "We are all children at heart said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Les Feux DArtifices the\nparty the games with ballsyes and even the conjurer the man who deceives\nthe eye however carefully it watchesmais questce que vous avez\n75\n\n\fI had caught him by the arm and was clutching him with one hand while with\nthe other I pointed.",
    "We were within a hundred yards of the house and just in front of us between\nus and the open French window there lay a huddled figure wrapped in a scarlet\nChinese shawl...\nMon Dieu whispered Poirot.",
    "Mon Dieu...\n\n76\n\n\fChapter 8\nThe Fatal Shawl\nI suppose it was not more than forty seconds that we stood there frozen with\nhorror unable to move but it seemed like an hour.",
    "Then Poirot moved forward\nshaking off my hand.",
    "He moved stiffly like an automaton.",
    "It has happened he murmured and I can hardly describe the anguished\nbitterness of his voice.",
    "In spite of everythingin spite of my precautions it has\nhappened.",
    "Ah miserable criminal that I am why did I not guard her better.",
    "I\nshould have foreseen.",
    "Not for one instant should I have left her side.",
    "You mustnt blame yourself I said.",
    "My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth and I could hardly articulate.",
    "Poirot only responded with a sorrowful shake of his head.",
    "He knelt down by the\nbody.",
    "And at that moment we received a second shock.",
    "For Nicks voice rang out clear and gay and a moment later Nick appeared in\nthe square of the window silhouetted against the lighted room behind.",
    "Sorry Ive been so long Maggie she said.",
    "But\nThen she broke offstaring at the scene before her.",
    "With a sharp exclamation Poirot turned over the body on the lawn and I pressed\nforward to see.",
    "I looked down into the dead face of Maggie Buckley.",
    "In another minute Nick was beside us.",
    "She gave a sharp cry.",
    "MaggieOh Maggieitit cant\nPoirot was still examining the girls body.",
    "At last very slowly he rose to his feet.",
    "77\n\n\fIs sheis Nicks voice broke off.",
    "Yes Mademoiselle.",
    "She is dead.",
    "But why But why Who could have wanted to kill her\nPoirots reply came quickly and firmly.",
    "It was not her they meant to kill Mademoiselle It was you They were misled\nby the shawl.",
    "A great cry broke from Nick.",
    "Why couldnt it have been me she wailed.",
    "Oh why couldnt it have been me\nId so much rather.",
    "I dont want to livenow.",
    "Id be gladwillinghappyto die.",
    "She flung up her arms wildly and then staggered slightly.",
    "I passed an arm round\nher quickly to support her.",
    "Take her into the house Hastings said Poirot.",
    "Then ring up the police.",
    "The police\nMais oui Tell them someone has been shot.",
    "And afterwards stay with\nMademoiselle Nick.",
    "On no account leave her.",
    "I nodded comprehension of these instructions and supporting the halffainting\ngirl made my way through the drawingroom window.",
    "I laid the girl on the sofa\nthere with a cushion under her head and then hurried out into the hall in\nsearch of the telephone.",
    "I gave a slight start on almost running into Ellen.",
    "She was standing there with a\nmost peculiar expression on her meek respectable face.",
    "Her eyes were glittering\nand she was passing her tongue repeatedly over her dry lips.",
    "Her hands were\ntrembling as though with excitement.",
    "As soon as she saw me she spoke.",
    "Hashas anything happened sir\nYes I said curtly.",
    "Wheres the telephone\n78\n\n\fNothingnothing wrong sir\nTheres been an accident I said evasively.",
    "Somebody hurt.",
    "I must telephone.",
    "Who has been hurt sir\nThere was a positive eagerness in her face.",
    "Miss Buckley.",
    "Miss Maggie Buckley.",
    "Miss Maggie Miss Maggie  Are you sure sirI mean are you sure thatthat its\nMiss Maggie\nIm quite sure I said.",
    "Why\nOhnothing.",
    "II thought it might be one of the other ladies.",
    "I thought perhaps it\nmight beMrs Rice.",
    "Look here I said.",
    "Wheres the telephone\nIts in the little room here sir.",
    "She opened the door for me and indicated the\ninstrument.",
    "Thanks I said.",
    "And as she seemed disposed to linger I added Thats all I want\nthank you.",
    "If you want Dr Graham\nNo no I said.",
    "Thats all.",
    "Go please.",
    "She withdrew reluctantly as slowly as she dared.",
    "In all probability she would\nlisten outside the door but I could not help that.",
    "After all she would soon know\nall there was to be known.",
    "I got the police station and made my report.",
    "Then on my own initiative I rang\nup the Dr Graham Ellen had mentioned.",
    "I found his number in the book.",
    "Nick at\nany rate should have medical attention I felteven though a doctor could do\nnothing for that poor girl lying out there.",
    "He promised to come at once and I\nhung up the receiver and came out into the hall again.",
    "79\n\n\fIf Ellen had been listening outside the door she had managed to disappear very\nswiftly.",
    "There was no one in sight when I came out.",
    "I went back into the drawingroom.",
    "Nick was trying to sit up.",
    "Do you thinkcould you get mesome brandy\nOf course.",
    "I hurried into the diningroom found what I wanted and came back.",
    "A few sips\nof the spirit revived the girl.",
    "The colour began to come back into her cheeks.",
    "I\nrearranged the cushion for her head.",
    "Its allso awful.",
    "She shivered.",
    "Everythingeverywhere.",
    "I know my dear I know.",
    "No you dont You cant.",
    "And its all such a waste.",
    "If it were only me.",
    "It would be\nall over...\nYou mustnt I said be morbid.",
    "She only shook her head reiterating You dont know You dont know\nThen suddenly she began to cry.",
    "A quiet hopeless sobbing like a child.",
    "That I\nthought was probably the best thing for her so I made no effort to stem her\ntears.",
    "When their first violence had died down a little I stole across to the window and\nlooked out.",
    "I had heard an outcry of voices a few minutes before.",
    "They were all\nthere by now a semicircle round the scene of the tragedy with Poirot like a\nfantastical sentinel keeping them back.",
    "As I watched two uniformed figures came striding across the grass.",
    "The police\nhad arrived.",
    "I went quietly back to my place by the sofa.",
    "Nick lifted her tearstained face.",
    "Oughtnt I to be doing something\n80\n\n\fNo my dear.",
    "Poirot will see to it.",
    "Leave it to him.",
    "Nick was silent for a minute or\ntwo then she said Poor Maggie.",
    "Poor dear old Maggie.",
    "Such a good sort who\nnever harmed a soul in her life.",
    "That this should happen to her.",
    "I feel as though\nId killed herbringing her down in the way that I did.",
    "I shook my head sadly.",
    "How little one can foresee the future.",
    "When Poirot\ninsisted on Nicks inviting a friend how little did he think that he was signing an\nunknown girls death warrant.",
    "We sat in silence.",
    "I longed to know what was going on outside but I loyally\nfulfilled Poirots instructions and stuck to my post.",
    "It seemed hours later when the door opened and Poirot and a police inspector\nentered the room.",
    "With them came a man who was evidently Dr Graham.",
    "He\ncame over at once to Nick.",
    "And how are you feeling Miss Buckley This must have been a terrible shock.",
    "His fingers were on her pulse.",
    "Not too bad.",
    "He turned to me.",
    "Has she had anything\nSome brandy I said.",
    "Im all right said Nick bravely.",
    "Able to answer a few questions eh\nOf course.",
    "The police inspector moved forward with a preliminary cough.",
    "Nick greeted him\nwith the ghost of a smile.",
    "Not impeding the traffic this time she said.",
    "I gathered they were not strangers to each other.",
    "81\n\n\fThis is a terrible business Miss Buckley said the inspector.",
    "Im very sorry about\nit.",
    "Now Mr Poirot here whose name Im very familiar with and proud we are to\nhave him with us Im sure tells me that to the best of his belief you were shot\nat in the grounds of the Majestic Hotel the other morning\nNick nodded.",
    "I thought it was just a wasp she explained.",
    "But it wasnt.",
    "And youd had some rather peculiar accidents before that\nYesat least it was odd their happening so close together.",
    "She gave a brief account of the various circumstances.",
    "Just so.",
    "Now how came it that your cousin was wearing your shawl tonight\nWe came in to fetch her coatit was rather cold watching the fireworks.",
    "I flung\noff the shawl on the sofa here.",
    "Then I went upstairs and put on the coat Im\nwearing nowa light nutria one.",
    "I also got a wrap for my friend Mrs Rice out of\nher room.",
    "There it is on the floor by the window.",
    "Then Maggie called out that\nshe couldnt find her coat.",
    "I said it must be downstairs.",
    "She went down and\ncalled up she still couldnt find it.",
    "I said it must have been left in the carit was a\ntweed coat she was looking forshe hasnt got an evening furry oneand I said Id\nbring her down something of mine.",
    "But she said it didnt mattershed take my\nshawl if I didnt want it.",
    "And I said of course but would that be enough And she\nsaid Oh yes because she really didnt feel it particularly cold after Yorkshire.",
    "She\njust wanted something.",
    "And I said all right Id be out in a minute.",
    "And when I\ndiddid come out\nShe stopped her voice breaking...\nNow dont distress yourself Miss Buckley.",
    "Just tell me this.",
    "Did you hear a shotor two shots\nNick shook her head.",
    "Noonly just the fireworks popping and the squibs going off.",
    "82\n\n\fThats just it said the inspector.",
    "Youd never notice a shot with all that going\non.",
    "Its no good asking you I suppose if youve any clue to who it is making\nthese attacks upon you\nI havent the least idea said Nick.",
    "I cant imagine.",
    "And you wouldnt be likely to said the inspector.",
    "Some homicidal maniacthats\nwhat it looks like to me.",
    "Nasty business.",
    "Well I wont need to ask you any more\nquestions tonight miss.",
    "Im more sorry about this than I can say.",
    "Dr Graham stepped forward.",
    "Im going to suggest Miss Buckley that you dont stay here.",
    "Ive been talking it\nover with M. Poirot.",
    "I know of an excellent nursing home.",
    "Youve had a shock\nyou know.",
    "What you need is complete rest\nNick was not looking at him.",
    "Her eyes had gone to Poirot.",
    "Is itbecause of the shock she asked.",
    "He came forward.",
    "I want you to feel safe mon enfant.",
    "And I want to feel too that you are safe.",
    "There will be a nurse therea nice practical unimaginative nurse.",
    "She will be near\nyou all night.",
    "When you wake up and cry outshe will be there close at hand.",
    "You understand\nYes said Nick I understand.",
    "But you dont.",
    "Im not afraid any longer.",
    "I dont\ncare one way or another.",
    "If anyone wants to murder me they can.",
    "Hush hush I said.",
    "Youre overstrung.",
    "You dont know.",
    "None of you know\nI really think M. Poirots plan is a good one the doctor broke in soothingly.",
    "I\nwill take you in my car.",
    "And we will give you a little something to ensure a good\nnights rest.",
    "Now what do you say\nI dont mind said Nick.",
    "Anything you like.",
    "It doesnt matter.",
    "83\n\n\fPoirot laid his hand on hers.",
    "I know Mademoiselle.",
    "I know what you must feel.",
    "I stand before you ashamed\nand stricken to the heart.",
    "I who promised protection have not been able to\nprotect.",
    "I have failed.",
    "I am a miserable.",
    "But believe me Mademoiselle my heart\nis in agony because of that failure.",
    "If you know what I am suffering you would\nforgive I am sure.",
    "Thats all right said Nick still in the same dull voice.",
    "You mustnt blame\nyourself.",
    "Im sure you did the best you could.",
    "Nobody could have helped itor\ndone more Im sure.",
    "Please dont be unhappy.",
    "You are very generous Mademoiselle.",
    "No I\nThere was an interruption.",
    "The door flew open and George Challenger rushed\ninto the room.",
    "Whats all this he cried.",
    "Ive just arrived.",
    "To find a policeman at the gate and a\nrumour that somebodys dead.",
    "What is it all about For Gods sake tell me.",
    "Is itis itNick\nThe anguish in his tone was dreadful to hear.",
    "I suddenly realized that Poirot and\nthe doctor between them completely blotted out Nick from his sight.",
    "Before anyone had time to answer he repeated his question.",
    "Tell meit cant be trueNick isnt dead\nNo mon ami said Poirot gently.",
    "She is alive.",
    "And he drew back so that Challenger could see the little figure on the sofa.",
    "For a moment or two Challenger stared at her incredulously.",
    "Then staggering a\nlittle like a drunken man he muttered NickNick.",
    "84\n\n\fAnd suddenly dropping on his knees beside the sofa and hiding his head in his\nhands he cried in a muffled voice Nickmy darlingI thought that you were\ndead.",
    "Nick tried to sit up.",
    "Its all right George.",
    "Dont be an idiot.",
    "Im quite safe.",
    "He raised his head and looked round wildly.",
    "But somebodys dead The policeman said so.",
    "Yes said Nick.",
    "Maggie.",
    "Poor old Maggie.",
    "Oh\nA spasm twisted her face.",
    "The doctor and Poirot came forward.",
    "Graham helped\nher to her feet.",
    "He and Poirot one on each side helped her from the room.",
    "The sooner you get to your bed the better remarked the doctor.",
    "Ill take you\nalong at once in my car.",
    "Ive asked Mrs Rice to pack a few things ready for you to\ntake.",
    "They disappeared through the door.",
    "Challenger caught my arm.",
    "I dont understand.",
    "Where are they taking her\nI explained.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Now then Hastings for Gods sake give me the hang of this thing.",
    "What a ghastly tragedy That poor girl.",
    "Come and have a drink I said.",
    "Youre all to pieces.",
    "I dont mind if I do.",
    "We adjourned to the diningroom.",
    "You see he explained as he put away a stiff whisky and soda I thought it was\nNick.",
    "85\n\n\fThere was very little doubt as to the feelings of Commander George Challenger.",
    "A more transparent lover never lived.",
    "86\n\n\fChapter 9\nA. to J.\nI doubt if I shall ever forget the night that followed.",
    "Poirot was a prey to such an\nagony of selfreproach that I was really alarmed.",
    "Ceaselessly he strode up and\ndown the room heaping anathemas on his own head and deaf to my wellmeant\nremonstrances.",
    "What it is to have too good an opinion of oneself.",
    "I am punishedyes I am\npunished.",
    "I Hercule Poirot.",
    "I was too sure of myself.",
    "No no I interpolated.",
    "But who would imaginewho could imaginesuch unparalleled audacity I had\ntaken as I thought all possible precautions.",
    "I had warned the murderer\nWarned the murderer\nMais oui.",
    "I had drawn attention to myself.",
    "I had let him see that I suspectedsomeone.",
    "I had made it or so I thought too dangerous for him to dare to repeat\nhis attempts at murder.",
    "I had drawn a cordon round Mademoiselle.",
    "And he slips\nthrough it Boldlyunder our very eyes almost he slips through it In spite of us\nallof everyone being on the alert he achieves his object.",
    "Only he doesnt I reminded him.",
    "That is the chance only From my point of view it is the same.",
    "A human life has\nbeen taken Hastingswhose life is nonessential.",
    "Of course I said.",
    "I didnt mean that.",
    "But on the other hand what you say is true.",
    "And that makes it worseten times\nworse.",
    "For the murderer is still as far as ever from achieving his object.",
    "Do you\nunderstand my friend The position is changedfor the worse.",
    "It may mean that\nnot one lifebut twowill be sacrificed.",
    "Not while youre about I said stoutly.",
    "87\n\n\fHe stopped and wrung my hand.",
    "Merci mon ami Merci You still have confidence in the old oneyou still have\nthe faith.",
    "You put new courage into me.",
    "Hercule Poirot will not fail again.",
    "No\nsecond life shall be taken.",
    "I will rectify my errorfor see you there must have\nbeen an error Somewhere there has been a lack of order and method in my\nusually so well arranged ideas.",
    "I will start again.",
    "Yes I will start at the beginning.",
    "And this timeI will not fail.",
    "You really think then I said that Nick Buckleys life is still in danger\nMy friend for what other reason did I send her to this nursing home\nThen it wasnt the shock\nThe shock Pah One can recover from shock as well in ones own home as in a\nnursing homebetter for that matter.",
    "It is not amusing there the floors of green\nlinoleum the conversation of the nursesthe meals on trays the ceaseless\nwashing.",
    "No no it is for safety and safety only.",
    "I take the doctor into my\nconfidence.",
    "He agrees.",
    "He will make all arrangements.",
    "No one mon ami not\neven her dearest friend will be admitted to see Miss Buckley.",
    "You and I are the\nonly ones permitted.",
    "Pour les autreseh bien Doctors orders they will be\ntold.",
    "A phrase very convenient and one not to be gainsayed.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "Only\nOnly what Hastings\nThat cant go on for ever.",
    "A very true observation.",
    "But it gives us a little breathing space.",
    "And you realize\ndo you not that the character of our operations has changed.",
    "In what way\nOur original task was to ensure the safety of Mademoiselle.",
    "Our task now is a\nmuch simpler onea task with which we are well acquainted.",
    "It is neither more\nnor less than the hunting down of a murderer.",
    "88\n\n\fYou call that simpler\nCertainly it is simpler.",
    "The murderer has as I said the other day signed his name\nto the crime.",
    "He has come out into the open.",
    "You dont think I hesitated then went on.",

    "You really think that\nI stopped.",
    "Poirot took up my sentence speaking very gravely.",
    "That the murderer is someone in Mademoiselles own circle Yes mon ami I\ndo.",
    "But surely last night must almost rule out that possibility.",
    "We were all together\nand\nHe interrupted.",
    "Could you swear Hastings that any particular person had never left our little\ncompany there on the edge of the cliff Is there any one person there whom you\ncould swear you had seen all the time\nNo I said slowly struck by his words.",
    "I dont think I could.",
    "It was dark.",
    "We all\nmoved about more or less.",
    "On different occasions I noticed Mrs Rice Lazarus\nyou Croft Vysebut all the timeno.",
    "Poirot nodded his head.",
    "Exactly.",
    "It would be a matter of a very few minutes.",
    "The two girls go to the\nhouse.",
    "The murderer slips away unnoticed hides behind that sycamore tree in\nthe middle of the lawn.",
    "Nick Buckley or so he thinks comes out of the window\npasses within a foot of him he fires three shots in rapid succession\nThree I interjected.",
    "89\n\n\fYes.",
    "He was taking no chances this time.",
    "We found three bullets in the body.",
    "That was risky wasnt it\nLess risky in all probability than one shot would have been.",
    "A Mauser pistol does\nnot make a great deal of noise.",
    "It would resemble more or less the popping of\nthe fireworks and blend in very well with the noise of them.",
    "Did you find the pistol I asked.",
    "No.",
    "And there Hastings lies to my mind the indisputable proof that no stranger\nis responsible for this.",
    "We agree do we not that Miss Buckleys own pistol was\ntaken in the first place for one reason onlyto give her death the appearance of\nsuicide.",
    "Yes.",
    "That is the only possible reason is it not But now you observe there is no\npretence of suicide.",
    "The murderer knows that we should not any longer be\ndeceived by it.",
    "He knows in fact what we know\nI reflected admitting to myself the logic of Poirots deduction.",
    "What did he do with the pistol do you think\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "For that it is difficult to say.",
    "But the sea was exceedingly handy.",
    "A good toss of\nthe arm and the pistol sinks never to be recovered.",
    "We cannot of course be\nabsolutely surebut that is what I should have done.",
    "His matteroffact tone made me shiver a little.",
    "Do you thinkdo you think he realized that hed killed the wrong person\nI am quite sure he did not said Poirot grimly.",
    "Yes that must have been an\nunpleasant little surprise for him when he learnt the truth.",
    "To keep his face and\nbetray nothingit cannot have been easy.",
    "90\n\n\fAt that moment I bethought me of the strange attitude of the maid Ellen.",
    "I gave\nPoirot an account of her peculiar demeanour.",
    "He seemed very interested.",
    "She betrayed surprise did she that it was Maggie who was dead\nGreat surprise.",
    "That is curious.",
    "And yet the fact of a tragedy was clearly not a surprise to her.",
    "Yes there is something there that must be looked into.",
    "Who is she this Ellen So\nquiet so respectable in the English manner Could it be she who He broke off.",
    "If youre going to include the accidents I said surely it would take a man to\nhave rolled that heavy boulder down the cliff.",
    "Not necessarily.",
    "It is very largely a question of leverage.",
    "Oh yes it could be\ndone.",
    "He continued his slow pacing up and down the room.",
    "Anyone who was at End House last night comes under suspicion.",
    "But those\nguestsno I do not think it was one of them.",
    "For the most part I should say they\nwere mere acquaintances.",
    "There was no intimacy between them and the young\nmistress of the house.",
    "Charles Vyse was there I remarked.",
    "Yes we must not forget him.",
    "He is logically our strongest suspect.",
    "He made a\ngesture of despair and threw himself into a chair opposite mine.",
    "Voil\u00e0it is\nalways that we come back to Motive We must find the motive if we are to\nunderstand this crime.",
    "And it is there Hastings that I am continually baffled.",
    "Who can possibly have a motive for doing away with Mademoiselle Nick I have\nlet myself go to the most absurd suppositions.",
    "I Hercule Poirot have descended\nto the most ignominious flights of fancy.",

    "Do you know Poirot I said I call that rather a bright idea.",
    "There may be\nsomething in it.",
    "Poirot groaned.",
    "You would say that It would appeal I knew to your romantic but slightly\nmediocre mind.",
    "Buried treasureyes you would enjoy that idea.",
    "WellI dont see why not\nBecause my friend the more prosaic explanation is nearly always more\nprobable.",
    "Then Mademoiselles fatherI have played with even more degrading\nideas concerning him.",
    "He was a traveller.",
    "Supposing I say to myself that he has\nstolen a jewelthe eye of a God.",
    "Jealous priests are on his tracks.",
    "Yes I Hercule\nPoirot have descended to depths such as these.",
    "I have had other ideas concerning this father he went on.",
    "Ideas at once more\ndignified and more probable.",
    "Did he in the course of his wanderings contract a\nsecond marriage Is there a nearer heir than M. Charles Vyse But again that\nleads nowhere for we are up against the same difficultythat there is really\nnothing of value to inherit.",
    "I have neglected no possibility.",
    "Even that chance reference of Mademoiselle\nNicks to the offer made her by M. Lazarus.",
    "You remember The offer to\npurchase her grandfathers portrait.",
    "I telegraphed on Saturday for an expert to\ncome down and examine that picture.",
    "He was the man about whom I wrote to\nMademoiselle this morning.",
    "Supposing for instance it were worth several\nthousand pounds\nYou surely dont think a rich man like young Lazarus\nIs he rich Appearances are not everything.",
    "Even an oldestablished firm with\npalatial showrooms and every appearance of prosperity may rest on a rotten\nbasis.",

    "It is farfetchedbut it is not\nso bad as revengeful priests or buried treasure.",
    "It bears at any rate some\nrelationship to things as they happen.",
    "And we can neglect nothingnothing that\nmight bring us nearer the truth.",
    "With careful fingers he straightened the objects on the table in front of him.",
    "When he spoke his voice was grave and for the first time calm.",
    "Motive he said.",
    "Let us come back to that and regard this problem calmly and\nmethodically.",
    "To begin with how many kinds of motive are there for murder\nWhat are the motives which lead one human being to take another human\nbeings life\nWe exclude for the moment homicidal mania.",
    "Because I am absolutely\nconvinced that the solution of our problem does not lie there.",
    "We also exclude\nkilling done on the spur of the moment under the impulse of an ungovernable\ntemper.",
    "This is coldblooded deliberate murder.",
    "What are the motives that\nactuate such a murder as that\nThere is first Gain.",
    "Who stood to gain by Mademoiselle Buckleys death\nDirectly or indirectly Well we can put down Charles Vyse.",
    "He inherits a\nproperty that from the financial point of view is probably not worth inheriting.",
    "He might perhaps pay off the mortgage build small villas on the land and\neventually make a small profit.",
    "It is possible.",
    "The place might be worth\nsomething to him if he had any deeply cherished love of itif it were for\ninstance a family place.",
    "That is undoubtedly an instinct very deeply implanted\nin some human beings and it has in cases I have known actually led to crime.",
    "But I cannot see any such motive in M. Vyses case.",
    "The only other person who would benefit at all by Mademoiselle Buckleys\ndeath is her friend Madame Rice.",
    "But the amount would clearly be a very small\none.",
    "Nobody else as far as I can see gains by Mademoiselle Buckleys death.",
    "93\n\n\fWhat is another motive Hateor love that has turned to hate.",
    "The crime\npassionnel.",
    "Well there again we have the word of the observant Madame Croft\nthat both Charles Vyse and Commander Challenger are in love with the young\nlady.",
    "I think we can say that we have observed the latter phenomenon for ourselves\nI remarked with a smile.",
    "Yeshe tends to wear his heart on his sleeve the honest sailor.",
    "For the other we\nrely on the word of Madame Croft.",
    "Now if Charles Vyse felt that he were\nsupplanted would he be so powerfully affected that he would kill his cousin\nrather than let her become the wife of another man\nIt sounds very melodramatic I said doubtfully.",
    "It sounds you would say unEnglish.",
    "I agree.",
    "But even the English have\nemotions.",
    "And a type such as Charles Vyse is the most likely to have them.",
    "He is\na repressed young man.",
    "One who does not show his feelings easily.",
    "Such often\nhave the most violent feelings.",
    "I would never suspect the Commander\nChallenger of murder for emotional reasons.",
    "No no he is not the type.",
    "But with\nCharles Vyseyes it is possible.",
    "But it does not entirely satisfy me.",
    "Another motive for crimeJealousy.",
    "I separate it from the last because jealousy\nmay not necessarily be a sexual emotion.",
    "There is envyenvy of possessionof\nsupremacy.",
    "Such a jealousy as drove the Iago of your great Shakespeare to one\nof the cleverest crimes speaking from the professional point of view that has\never been committed.",
    "Why was it so clever I asked momentarily diverted.",
    "Parbleubecause he got others to execute it.",
    "Imagine a criminal nowadays on\nwhom one was unable to put the handcuffs because he had never done anything\nhimself.",
    "But this is not the subject we were discussing.",
    "Can jealousy of any kind\nbe responsible for this crime Who has reason to envy Mademoiselle Another\nwoman There is only Madame Rice and as far as we can see there was no\nrivalry between the two women.",
    "But again that is only as far as we can see.",
    "There may be something there.",
    "94\n\n\fLastlyFear.",
    "Does Mademoiselle Nick by any chance hold somebodys secret in\nher power Does she know something which if it were known might ruin\nanother life If so I think we can say very definitely that she herself is unaware\nof it .",
    "But that might be you know.",
    "That might be.",
    "And if so it makes it very\ndifficult.",
    "Because whilst she holds the clue in her hands she holds it\nunconsciously and will be quite unable to tell us what it is.",
    "You really think that is possible\nIt is a hypothesis.",
    "I am driven to it by the difficulty of finding a reasonable theory\nelsewhere.",
    "When you have eliminated other possibilities you turn to the one\nthat is left and saysince the other is notthis must be so...",
    "He was silent a long time.",
    "At last rousing himself from his absorption he drew a sheet of paper towards\nhim and began to write.",

    "Thank you Madame for your frankness.",
    "She glanced at him sharply seemed about to speak then thought better of it\nand went out of the room smiling faintly at me as I held the door open for her.",
    "She is intelligent said Poirot.",
    "Yes but so is Hercule Poirot\nWhat do you mean\nThat it is all very well and very pretty to force the richness of M. Lazarus down\nmy throat\nI must say that rather disgusted me.",
    "Mon cher always you have the right reaction in the wrong place.",
    "It is not for\nthe moment a question of good taste or otherwise.",
    "If Madame Rice has a\ndevoted friend who is rich and can give her all she needswhy then obviously\nMadame Rice would not need to murder her dearest friend for a mere pittance.",
    "Oh I said.",
    "Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment Oh\n106\n\n\fWhy didnt you stop her going to the nursing home\nWhy should I show my hand Is it Hercule Poirot who prevents Mademoiselle\nNick from seeing her friends Quelle id\u00e9e It is the doctors and the nurses.",
    "Those\ntiresome nurses So full of rules and regulations and doctors orders.",
    "Youre not afraid that they may let her in after all Nick may insist.",
    "Nobody will be let in my dear Hastings but you and me.",
    "And for that matter\nthe sooner we make our way there the better.",
    "The sittingroom door flew open and George Challenger barged in.",
    "His tanned\nface was alive with indignation.",
    "Look here M. Poirot he said.",
    "Whats the meaning of this I rang up that\ndamned nursing home where Nick is.",
    "Asked how she was and what time I could\ncome round and see her.",
    "And they say the doctor wont allow any visitors.",
    "I want\nto know the meaning of that.",
    "To put it plainly is this your work Or is Nick really\nill from shock\nI assure you Monsieur that I do not lay down rules for nursing homes.",
    "I would\nnot dare.",
    "Why not ring up the good doctorwhat was his name nowAh yes\nGraham.",
    "I have.",
    "He says shes going on as well as could be expectedusual stuff.",
    "But I\nknow all the tricksmy uncles a doctor.",
    "Harley Street.",
    "Nerve specialist.",
    "Psychoanalysisall the rest of it.",
    "Putting relations and friends off with soothing\nwords.",
    "Ive heard about it all.",
    "I dont believe Nick isnt up to seeing any one.",
    "I\nbelieve youre at the bottom of this M. Poirot.",
    "Poirot smiled at him in a very kindly fashion.",
    "Indeed I have always observed that\nPoirot has a kindly feeling for a lover.",
    "Now listen to me mon ami he said.",
    "If one guest is admitted others cannot be\nkept out.",
    "You comprehend It must be all or none.",
    "We want Mademoiselles\nsafety you and I do we not Exactly.",
    "Then you understandit must be none.",
    "I get you said Challenger slowly.",
    "But then\n107\n\n\fChut We will say no more.",
    "We will forget even what we have said.",
    "The\nprudence the extreme prudence is what is needed at present.",
    "I can hold my tongue said the sailor quietly.",
    "He turned away to the door pausing as he went out to say No embargo on\nflowers is there So long as they are not white ones.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "And now he said as the door shut behind the impetuous Challenger whilst M.\nChallenger and Madame and perhaps M. Lazarus all encounter each other in the\nflower shop you and I will drive quietly to our destination.",
    "And ask for the answer to the three questions I said.",
    "Yes.",
    "We will ask.",
    "Though as a matter of fact I know the answer.",
    "What I exclaimed.",
    "Yes.",
    "But when did you find out\nWhilst I was eating my breakfast Hastings.",
    "It stared me in the face.",
    "Tell me.",
    "No I will leave you to hear it from Mademoiselle.",
    "Then as if to distract my mind he pushed an open letter across to me.",
    "It was a report by the expert Poirot had sent to examine the picture of old\nNicholas Buckley.",
    "It stated definitely that the picture was worth at most twenty\npounds.",
    "So that is one matter cleared up said Poirot.",
    "No mouse in that mousehole I said remembering a metaphor of Poirots on\none past occasion.",
    "108\n\n\fAh you remember that No as you say no mouse in that mousehole.",
    "Twenty\npounds and M. Lazarus offered fifty.",
    "What an error of judgement for a seemingly\nastute young man.",
    "But there there we must start on our errand.",
    "The nursing home was set high on a hill overlooking the bay.",
    "A whitecoated\norderly received us.",
    "We were put into a little room downstairs and presently a\nbrisklooking nurse came to us.",
    "One glance at Poirot seemed to be enough.",
    "She had clearly received her\ninstructions from Dr Graham together with a minute description of the little\ndetective.",
    "She even concealed a smile.",
    "Miss Buckley has passed a very fair night she said.",
    "Come up will you\nIn a pleasant room with the sun streaming into it we found Nick.",
    "In the narrow\niron bed she looked like a tired child.",
    "Her face was white and her eyes were\nsuspiciously red and she seemed listless and weary.",
    "Its good of you to come she said in a flat voice.",
    "Poirot took her hand in both of his.",
    "Courage Mademoiselle.",
    "There is always something to live for.",
    "The words startled her.",
    "She looked up in his face.",
    "Oh she said.",
    "Oh\nWill you not tell me now Mademoiselle what it was that has been worrying you\nlately Or shall I guess And may I offer you Mademoiselle my very deepest\nsympathy.",
    "Her face flushed.",
    "So you know.",
    "Oh well it doesnt matter who knows now.",
    "Now that its all over.",
    "Now that I shall never see him again.",
    "Her voice broke.",
    "109\n\n\fCourage Mademoiselle.",
    "I havent got any courage left.",
    "Ive used up every bit in these last weeks.",
    "Hoping\nand hoping andjust latelyhoping against hope.",
    "I stared.",
    "I could not understand one word.",
    "Regard the poor Hastings said Poirot.",
    "He does not know what we are talking\nabout.",
    "Her unhappy eyes met mine.",
    "Michael Seton the airman she said.",
    "I was engaged to himand hes dead.",
    "110\n\n\fChapter 11\nThe Motive\nI was dumbfounded.",
    "I turned on Poirot.",
    "Is this what you meant\nYes mon ami.",
    "This morningI knew.",
    "How did you know How did you guess You said it stared you in the face at\nbreakfast.",
    "So it did my friend.",
    "From the front page of the newspaper.",
    "I remembered the\nconversation at dinner last nightand I saw everything.",
    "He turned to Nick again.",
    "You heard the news last night\nYes.",
    "On the wireless.",
    "I made an excuse about the telephone.",
    "I wanted to hear\nthe news alonein case... She swallowed hard.",
    "And I heard it...",
    "I know I know.",
    "He took her hand in both of his.",
    "It waspretty ghastly.",
    "And all the people arriving.",
    "I dont know how I got through\nit.",
    "It all felt like a dream.",
    "I could see myself from outsidebehaving just as usual.",
    "It was queer somehow.",
    "Yes yes I understand.",
    "And then when I went to fetch Freddies wrapI broke down for a minute.",
    "I\npulled myself together quite quickly.",
    "But Maggie kept calling up about her coat.",
    "And then at last she took my shawl and went and I put on some powder and\nsome rouge and followed her out.",
    "And there she wasdead...",
    "Yes yes it must have been a terrible shock.",
    "111\n\n\fYou dont understand.",
    "I was angry I wished it had been me I wanted to be\ndeadand there I wasalive and perhaps to live for years And Michael deaddrowned far away in the Pacific.",
    "Pauvre enfant.",
    "I dont want to be alive.",
    "I dont want to live I tell you she cried rebelliously.",
    "I knowI know.",
    "To all of us Mademoiselle there comes a time when death is\npreferable to life.",
    "But it passessorrow passes and grief.",
    "You cannot believe that\nnow I know.",
    "It is useless for an old man like me to talk.",
    "Idle wordsthat is what\nyou thinkidle words.",
    "You think Ill forgetand marry someone else Never\nShe looked rather lovely as she sat up in bed her two hands clenched and her\ncheeks burning.",
    "Poirot said gently No no.",
    "I am not thinking anything of the kind.",
    "You are very\nlucky Mademoiselle.",
    "You have been loved by a brave mana hero.",
    "How did you\ncome to meet him\nIt was at Le Touquetlast September.",
    "Nearly a year ago.",
    "And you became engagedwhen\nJust after Christmas.",
    "But it had to be a secret.",
    "Why was that\nMichaels uncleold Sir Matthew Seton.",
    "He loved birds and hated women.",
    "Ah ce nest pas raisonnable\nWellI dont mean quite that.",
    "He was a complete crank.",
    "Thought women ruined\na mans life.",
    "And Michael was absolutely dependent on him.",
    "He was frightfully\nproud of Michael and it was he who financed the building of the Albatross and\nthe expenses of the roundtheworld flight.",
    "It was the dearest dream of his life as\nwell as of Michaels.",
    "If Michael had pulled it offwell then he could have asked\n112\n\n\fhis uncle anything.",
    "And even if old Sir Matthew had still cut up rough well it\nwouldnt have really mattered.",
    "Michael would have been madea kind of world\nhero.",
    "His uncle would have come round in the end.",
    "Yes yes I see.",
    "But Michael said it would be fatal if anything leaked out.",
    "We must keep it a dead\nsecret.",
    "And I did.",
    "I never told anyonenot even Freddie.",
    "Poirot groaned.",
    "If only you had told me Mademoiselle.",
    "Nick stared at him.",
    "But what difference would it have made It couldnt have anything to do with\nthese mysterious attacks on me No Id promised Michaeland I kept my word.",
    "But it was awfulthe anxiety wondering and getting in a state the whole time.",
    "And everyone saying one was so nervy.",
    "And being unable to explain.",
    "Yes I comprehend all that.",
    "He was missing once before you know.",
    "Crossing the desert on the way to India.",
    "That was pretty awful and then after all it was all right.",
    "His machine was\ndamaged but it was put right and he went on.",
    "And I kept saying to myself that it\nwould be the same this time.",
    "Everyone said he must be deadand I kept telling\nmyself that he must be all right really.",
    "And thenlast night...",
    "Her voice trailed away.",
    "You had hoped up till then\nI dont know.",
    "I think it was more that I refused to believe.",
    "It was awful never\nbeing able to talk to anyone.",
    "Yes I can imagine that.",
    "Were you never tempted to tell Madame Rice for\ninstance\nSometimes I wanted to frightfully.",
    "113\n\n\fYou do not think sheguessed\nI dont think so.",
    "Nick considered the idea carefully.",
    "She never said anything.",
    "Of\ncourse she used to hint things sometimes.",
    "About our being great friends and all\nthat.",
    "You never considered telling her when M. Setons uncle died You know that he\ndied about a week ago\nI know.",
    "He had an operation or something.",
    "I suppose I might have told anybody\nthen.",
    "But it wouldnt have been a nice way of doing it would it I mean it would\nhave seemed rather boastfulto do it just thenwhen all the papers were full of\nMichael.",
    "And reporters would have come and interviewed me.",
    "It would all have\nbeen rather cheap.",
    "And Michael would have hated it.",
    "I agree with you Mademoiselle.",
    "You could not have announced it publicly.",
    "I only\nmeant that you could have spoken of it privately to a friend.",
    "I did sort of hint to one person said Nick.",
    "Ithought it was only fair.",
    "But I dont\nknow how much hethe person took in.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Are you on good terms with your cousin M. Vyse he asked with a rather\nabrupt change of subject.",
    "Charles What put him into your head\nI was just wonderingthat was all.",
    "Charles means well said Nick.",
    "Hes a frightful stick of course.",
    "Never moves out\nof this place.",
    "He disapproves of me I think.",
    "Oh Mademoiselle Mademoiselle.",
    "And I hear that he has laid all his devotion at\nyour feet\nDisapproving of a person doesnt keep you from having a pash for them.",
    "Charles\nthinks my mode of life is reprehensible and he disapproves of my cocktails my\n114\n\n\fcomplexion my friends and my conversation.",
    "But he still feels my fatal\nfascination.",
    "He always hopes to reform me I think.",
    "She paused and then said with a ghost of a twinkle Who have you been\npumping to get the local information\nYou must not give me away Mademoiselle.",
    "I had a little conversation with the\nAustralian lady Madame Croft.",
    "Shes rather an old dearwhen one has time for her.",
    "Terribly sentimental.",
    "Love\nand home and childrenyou know the sort of thing.",
    "I am oldfashioned and sentimental myself Mademoiselle.",
    "Are you I should have said that Captain Hastings was the sentimental one of\nyou two.",
    "I blushed indignantly.",
    "He is furious said Poirot eying my discomfiture with a good deal of pleasure.",
    "But you are right Mademoiselle.",
    "Yes you are right.",
    "Not at all I said angrily.",
    "Hastings has a singularly beautiful nature.",
    "It has been the greatest hindrance to\nme at times.",
    "Dont be absurd Poirot.",
    "He is to begin with reluctant to see evil anywhere and when he does see it his\nrighteous indignation is so great that he is incapable of dissembling.",
    "Altogether a\nrare and beautiful nature.",
    "No mon ami I will not permit you to contradict me.",
    "It\nis as I say.",
    "Youve both been very kind to me said Nick gently.",
    "L\u00e0 l\u00e0 Mademoiselle.",
    "That is nothing.",
    "We have much more to do.",
    "To begin with\nyou will remain here.",
    "You will obey orders.",
    "You will do what I tell you.",
    "At this\njuncture I must not be hampered.",
    "115\n\n\fNick sighed wearily.",
    "Ill do anything you like.",
    "I dont care what I do.",
    "You will see no friends for the present.",
    "I dont care.",
    "I dont want to see anyone.",
    "For you the passive partfor us the active one.",
    "Now Mademoiselle I am going\nto leave you.",
    "I will not intrude longer upon your sorrow.",
    "He moved towards the door pausing with his hand on the handle to say over his\nshoulder By the way you once mentioned a will you made.",
    "Where is it this\nwill\nOh its knocking round somewhere.",
    "At End House\nYes.",
    "In a safe Locked up in your desk\nWell I really dont know.",
    "Its somewhere about.",
    "She frowned.",
    "Im frightfully\nuntidy you know.",
    "Papers and things like that would be mostly in the writingtable in the library.",
    "Thats where most of the bills are.",
    "The will is probably with\nthem.",
    "Or it might be in my bedroom.",
    "You permit me to make the searchyes\nIf you want toyes.",
    "Look at anything you like.",
    "Merci Mademoiselle.",
    "I will avail myself of your permission.",
    "116\n\n\fChapter 12\nEllen\nPoirot said no word till we had emerged from the nursing home into the outer\nair.",
    "Then he caught me by the arm.",
    "You see Hastings You see Ah Sacr\u00e9 tonnerre I was right I was right Always I\nknew there was something lackingsome piece of the puzzle that was not there.",
    "And without that missing piece the whole thing was meaningless.",
    "His almost despairing triumph was doubleDutch to me.",
    "I Could not see that\nanything very epochmaking had occurred.",
    "It was there all the time.",
    "And I could not see it.",
    "But how should I To know there\nis something that yesbut to know what that something is.",
    "Ah \u00c7a cest bien\nplus difficile.",
    "Do you mean that this has some direct bearing on the crime\nMa foi do you not see\nAs a matter of fact I dont.",
    "Is it possible Why it gives us what we have been looking forthe motivethe\nhidden obscure motive\nI may be very dense but I cant see it.",
    "Do you mean jealousy of some kind\nJealousy No no my friend.",
    "The usual motivethe inevitable motive.",
    "Money my\nfriend money\nI stared.",
    "He went on speaking more calmly.",
    "Listen mon ami.",
    "Just over a week ago Sir Matthew Seton dies.",
    "And Sir Matthew\nSeton was a millionaireone of the richest men in England.",
    "Yes but\n117\n\n\fAttendez.",
    "One step at a time.",
    "He has a nephew whom he idolizes and to whom\nwe may safely assume he has left his vast fortune.",
    "But\nMais ouilegacies yes an endowment to do with his hobby yes but the bulk of\nthe money would go to Michael Seton.",
    "Last Tuesday Michael Seton is reported\nmissingand on Wednesday the attacks on Mademoiselles life begin.",
    "Supposing\nHastings that Michael Seton made a will before he started on his flight and that\nin that will he left all he had to his fianc\u00e9e.",
    "Thats pure supposition.",
    "It is suppositionyes.",
    "But it must be so.",
    "Because if it is not so there is no\nmeaning in anything that has happened.",
    "It is no paltry inheritance that is at\nstake.",
    "It is an enormous fortune.",
    "I was silent for some minutes turning the matter over in my mind.",
    "It seemed to\nme that Poirot was leaping to conclusions in a most reckless manner and yet I\nwas secretly convinced that he was right.",
    "It was his extraordinary flair for being\nright that influenced me.",
    "Yet it seemed to me that there was a good deal to be\nproved still.",
    "But if nobody knew of the engagement I argued.",
    "Pah Somebody did know.",
    "For the matter of that somebody always does know.",
    "If they do not know they guess.",
    "Madame Rice suspected.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick\nadmitted as much.",
    "She may have had means of turning those suspicions into\ncertainties.",
    "How\nWell for one thing there must have been letters from Michael Seton to\nMademoiselle Nick.",
    "They had been engaged some time.",
    "And her best friend\ncould not call that young lady anything but careless.",
    "She leaves things here and\nthere and everywhere.",
    "I doubt if she has ever locked up anything in her life.",
    "Oh\nyes there would be means of making sure.",
    "118\n\n\fAnd Frederica Rice would know about the will that her friend had made\nDoubtless.",
    "Oh yes it narrows down now.",
    "You remember my lista list of\npersons numbered from A. to J.",
    "It has narrowed down to only two persons.",
    "I\ndismiss the servants.",
    "I dismiss the Commander Challengereven though he did\ntake one hour and a half to reach here from Plymouthand the distance is only\nthirty miles.",
    "I dismiss the longnosed M. Lazarus who offered fifty pounds for a\npicture that was only worth twenty it is odd that when you come to think of it.",
    "Most uncharacteristic of his race.",
    "I dismiss the Australiansso hearty and so\npleasant.",
    "I keep two people on my list still.",
    "One is Frederica Rice I said slowly.",
    "I had a vision of her face the golden hair the white fragility of the features.",
    "Yes.",
    "She is indicated very clearly.",
    "However carelessly worded Mademoiselles\nwill may have been she would be plainly indicated as residuary legatee.",
    "Apart\nfrom End House everything was to go to her.",
    "If Mademoiselle Nick instead of\nMademoiselle Maggie had been shot last night Madame Rice would be a rich\nwoman today.",
    "I can hardly believe it\nYou mean that you can hardly believe that a beautiful woman can be a\nmurderess One often has a little difficulty with members of a jury on that\naccount.",
    "But you may be right.",
    "There is still another suspect.",
    "Who\nCharles Vyse.",
    "But he only inherits the house.",
    "Yesbut he may not know that.",
    "Did he make Mademoiselles will for her I think\nnot.",
    "If so it would be in his keeping not knocking around somewhere or\nwhatever the phrase was that Mademoiselle used.",
    "So you see Hastingsit is\nquite probable that he knows nothing about that will.",
    "He may believe that she\nhas never made a will and that in that case he will inherit as next of kin.",
    "119\n\n\fYou know I said that really seems to me much more probable.",
    "That is your romantic mind Hastings.",
    "The wicked solicitor.",
    "A familiar figure in\nfiction.",
    "If as well as being a solicitor he has an impassive face it makes the\nmatter almost certain.",
    "It is true that in some ways he is more in the picture\nthan Madame.",
    "He would be more likely to know about the pistol and more likely\nto use one.",
    "And to send the boulder crashing down.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "Though as I have told you much can be done by leverage.",
    "And the fact\nthat the boulder was dislodged at the wrong minute and consequently missed\nMademoiselle is more suggestive of feminine agency.",
    "The idea of tampering\nwith the interior of a car seems masculine in conceptionthough many women\nare as good mechanics as men nowadays.",
    "On the other hand there are one or\ntwo gaps in the theory against M. Vyse.",
    "Such as\nHe is less likely to have known of the engagement than Madame.",
    "And there is\nanother point.",
    "His action was rather precipitate.",
    "What do you mean\nWell until last night there was nocertitude that Seton was dead.",
    "To act rashly\nwithout due assurance seems very uncharacteristic of the legal mind.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "A woman would jump to conclusions.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Ce que femme veut Dieu veut.",
    "That is the attitude.",
    "Its really amazing the way Nick has escaped.",
    "It seems almost incredible.",
    "And suddenly I remembered the tone in Fredericas voice as she had said Nick\nbears a charmed life.",
    "I shivered a little.",
    "120\n\n\fYes said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "And I can take no credit to myself.",
    "Which is\nhumiliating.",
    "Providence I murmured.",
    "Ah mon ami I would not put on the shoulders of the good God the burden of\nmens wrong doing.",
    "You say that in your Sunday morning voice of thankfulnesswithout reflecting that what you are really saying is that le bon Dieu has killed\nMiss Maggie Buckley.",
    "Really Poirot\nReally my friend But I will not sit back and say le bon Dieu has arranged\neverything I will not interfere.",
    "Because I am convinced that le bon Dieu created\nHercule Poirot for the express purpose of interfering.",
    "It is my m\u00e9tier.",
    "We had been slowly ascending the zigzag path up the cliff.",
    "It was at this juncture\nthat we passed through the little gate into the grounds of End House.",
    "Pouf said Poirot.",
    "That ascent is a steep one.",
    "I am hot.",
    "My moustaches are\nlimp.",
    "Yes as I was saying just now I am on the side of the innocent.",
    "I am on the\nside of Mademoiselle Nick because she was attacked.",
    "I am on the side of\nMademoiselle Maggie because she has been killed.",
    "And you are against Frederica Rice and Charles Vyse.",
    "No no Hastings.",
    "I keep an open mind.",
    "I say only that at the moment one of\nthose two is indicated.",
    "Chut\nWe had come out on the strip of lawn by the house and a man was driving a\nmowing machine.",
    "He had a long stupid face and lacklustre eyes.",
    "Beside him\nwas a small boy of about ten ugly but intelligentlooking.",
    "It crossed my mind that we had not heard the mowing machine in action but I\npresumed that the gardener was not overworking himself.",
    "He had probably been\nresting from his labours and had sprung into action on hearing our voices\napproaching.",
    "121\n\n\fGood morning said Poirot.",
    "Good morning sir.",
    "You are the gardener I suppose.",
    "The husband of Madame who works in the\nhouse.",
    "Hes my Dad said the small boy.",
    "Thats right sir said the man.",
    "Youll be the foreign gentleman I take it thats\nreally a detective.",
    "Is there any news of the young mistress sir\nI come from seeing her at the immediate moment.",
    "She has passed a satisfactory\nnight.",
    "Weve had policemen here said the small boy.",
    "Thats where the lady was\nkilled.",
    "Here by the steps.",
    "I seen a pig killed once havent I Dad\nAh said his father unemotionally.",
    "Dad used to kill pigs when he worked on a farm.",
    "Didnt you Dad I seen a pig\nkilled.",
    "I liked it.",
    "Young uns like to see pigs killed said the man as though stating one of the\nunalterable facts of nature.",
    "Shot with a pistol the lady was continued the boy.",
    "She didnt have her throat\ncut.",
    "No\nWe passed on to the house and I felt thankful to get away from the ghoulish\nchild.",
    "Poirot entered the drawingroom the windows of which were open and rang\nthe bell.",
    "Ellen neatly attired in black came in answer to the bell.",
    "She showed no\nsurprise at seeing us.",
    "Poirot explained that we were here by permission of Miss Buckley to make a\nsearch of the house.",
    "122\n\n\fVery good sir.",
    "The police have finished\nThey said they had seen everything they wanted sir.",
    "Theyve been about the\ngarden since very early in the morning.",

    "Were you expecting anything of the kind\nShe was silent.",
    "Her fingers pleated a corner of her apron.",

    "Yes yes said Poirot I would understand.",
    "However fantastic what you may say\nI would understand.",
    "She looked at him doubtfully then seemed to make up her mind to trust him.",
    "You see sir she said this isnt a good house.",
    "I was surprised and a little contemptuous.",

    "You mean it is an old house.",
    "Yes sir not a good house.",
    "123\n\n\fYou have been here long\nSix years sir.",
    "But I was here as a girl.",

    "Its a sort of feeling in the air.",
    "I always\nknew something bad would happen in this house someday.",
    "Well you have been proved right.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "There was a very slight underlying satisfaction in her tone the satisfaction of one\nwhose gloomy prognostications have been shown to be correct.",
    "But you didnt think it would be Miss Maggie.",
    "No indeed I didnt sir.",
    "Nobody hated her Im sure of it.",
    "It seemed to me that in those words was a clue.",
    "I expected Poirot to follow it up\nbut to my surprise he shifted to quite a different subject.",

    "You did not endeavour to search for the coat for\nheror get it from the car where it had been left\nI had my work to do sir.",
    "Quite soand doubtless neither of the two young ladies asked you because they\nthought you were out looking at the fireworks\nYes sir.",
    "So that other years you have been out looking at the fireworks\nA sudden flush came into her pale cheeks.",
    "I dont know what you mean sir.",

    "Oh that is not what I mean at all.",
    "The blush rose to her face again.",
    "If you think I was hiding anywhereI wasnt I heard Miss Nick run down the\nstairs and out and I heard her cry outand I came into the hall to see ifif\nanything was the matter.",

    "She heard Nick rush down the stairs and out and she\nherself came into the hall to find out what had happened.",
    "That is natural\nenough.",
    "But why did she not go out and watch the fireworks that evening That\nis what I should like to know Hastings.",
    "What was your idea in asking about a secret hiding place\nA mere fanciful idea that after all we might not have disposed of J.\nJ\nYes.",
    "The last person on my list.",
    "The problematical outsider.",

    "Decidedly my poor Hastings you belong to the Victorian era.",
    "Mademoiselle\nNick would tell you so if she were here.",

    "It had to be this way.",
    "We have\nnow some very valuable evidence.",
    "In what way\nWe now know that the fact of Michaels having made a will in favour of\nMademoiselle Nick is actually recorded in writing.",
    "Anyone who had read those\nletters would know the fact.",
    "And with letters carelessly hidden like that anyone\ncould read them.",
    "Ellen\nEllen almost certainly I should say.",
    "We will try a little experiment on her before\npassing out.",
    "There is no sign of the will.",
    "No that is curious.",
    "But in all probability it is thrown on top of a bookcase or\ninside a china jar.",
    "We must try to awaken Mademoiselles memory on that point.",
    "At any rate there is nothing more to be found here.",
    "Ellen was dusting the hall as we descended.",

    "Complete and absolute surprise registered very convincingly I remarked as we\ngot outside.",
    "Yes.",
    "It really seemed genuine.",
    "133\n\n\fPerhaps it was I suggested.",
    "And that packet of letters reclining for months under the lingerie  No mon\nami.",
    "All very well I thought to myself.",
    "But we are not all Hercule Poirots.",
    "We do not\nall go nosing into what does not concern us.",
    "But I said nothing.",
    "This Ellenshe is an enigma said Poirot.",
    "I do not like it.",
    "There is something here\nthat I do not understand.",
    "134\n\n\fChapter 14\nThe Mystery of the Missing Will\nWe went straight back to the nursing home.",

    "Yes Mademoiselle said Poirot answering her look.",

    "I pop up again.",
    "To begin with I will tell you that I have put the order in your\naffairs.",
    "Everything is now neatly arranged.",
    "Well I expect it was about time said Nick unable to help smiling.",
    "Are you very\ntidy M. Poirot\nAsk my friend Hastings here.",
    "The girl turned an inquiring gaze on me.",
    "I detailed some of Poirots minor peculiaritiestoast that had to be made from a\nsquare loafeggs matching in sizehis objection to golf as a game shapeless and\nhaphazard whose only redeeming feature was the tee boxes I ended by telling\nher the famous case which Poirot had solved by his habit of straightening\nornaments on the mantelpiece.",
    "Poirot sat by smiling.",
    "He makes the good tale of it yes he said when I had finished.",
    "But on the\nwhole it is true.",
    "Figure to yourself Mademoiselle that I never cease trying to\npersuade Hastings to part his hair in the middle instead of on the side.",
    "See what\nan air lopsided and unsymmetrical it gives him.",
    "Then you must disapprove of me M. Poirot said Nick.",
    "I wear a side parting.",
    "And you must approve of Freddie who parts her hair in the middle.",
    "He was certainly admiring her the other evening I put in maliciously.",
    "Now I\nknow the reason.",
    "135\n\n\fCest assez said Poirot.",
    "I am here on serious business.",
    "Mademoiselle this will\nof yours I find it not.",
    "Oh She wrinkled her brows.",
    "But does it matter so much After all Im not\ndead.",
    "And wills arent really important till you are dead are they\nThat is correct.",
    "All the same I interest myself in this will of yours.",
    "I have various\nlittle ideas concerning it.",
    "Think Mademoiselle.",
    "Try to remember where you\nplaced itwhere you saw it last\nI dont suppose I put it anywhere particular said Nick.",
    "I never do put things in\nplaces.",
    "I probably shoved it into a drawer.",
    "You did not put it in the secret panel by any chance\nThe secret what\nYour maid Ellen says that there is a secret panel in the drawingroom or the\nlibrary.",
    "Nonsense said Nick.",
    "Ive never heard of such a thing.",
    "Ellen said so\nMais oui.",
    "It seems she was in service at End House as a young girl.",
    "The cook\nshowed it to her.",
    "Its the first Ive ever heard of it.",
    "I suppose Grandfather must have known about\nit but if so he didnt tell me.",
    "And Im sure he would have told me.",
    "M. Poirot are\nyou sure Ellen isnt making it all up\nNo Mademoiselle I am not at all sure Il me semble that there is somethingodd about this Ellen of yours.",
    "Oh I wouldnt call her odd.",
    "Williams a halfwit and the child is a nasty little\nbrute but Ellens all right.",
    "The essence of respectability.",
    "Did you give her leave to go out and see the fireworks last night\nMademoiselle\nOf course.",
    "They always do.",
    "They clear up afterwards.",
    "136\n\n\fYet she did not go out.",
    "Oh yes she did.",
    "How do you know Mademoiselle\nWellwellI suppose I dont know.",
    "I told her to go and she thanked meand so of\ncourse I assumed that she did go.",
    "On the contraryshe remained in the house.",
    "Buthow very odd\nYou think it odd\nYes I do.",
    "Im sure shes never done such a thing before.",
    "Did she say why\nShe did not tell me the real reasonof that I am sure.",
    "Nick looked at him questioningly.",
    "Is itimportant\nPoirot flung out his hands.",
    "That is just what I cannot say Mademoiselle.",
    "Cest curieux.",
    "I leave it like that.",
    "This panel business too said Nick reflectively.",
    "I cant help thinking thats\nfrightfully queerand unconvincing.",
    "Did she show you where it was\nShe said she couldnt remember.",
    "I dont believe there is such a thing.",
    "It certainly looks like it.",
    "She must be going batty poor thing.",
    "She certainly recounts the histories She said also that End House was not a\ngood house to live in.",
    "137\n\n\fNick gave a little shiver.",
    "Perhaps shes right there she said slowly.",
    "Sometimes Ive felt that way myself.",
    "Theres a queer feeling in that house...",
    "Her eyes grew large and dark.",
    "They had a fated look.",
    "Poirot hastened to recall\nher to other topics.",
    "We have wandered from our subject Mademoiselle.",
    "The will.",
    "The last will and\ntestament of Magdala Buckley.",
    "I put that said Nick with some pride.",
    "I remember putting that and I said pay\nall debts and testamentary expenses.",
    "I remembered that out of a book Id read.",
    "You did not use a will form then\nNo there wasnt time for that.",
    "I was just going off to the nursing home and\nbesides Mr Croft said will forms were very dangerous.",
    "It was better to make a\nsimple will and not try to be too legal.",
    "M. Croft He was there\nYes.",
    "It was he who asked me if Id made one.",
    "Id never have thought of it myself.",
    "He said if you died inin\nIntestate I said.",
    "Yes thats it.",
    "He said if you died intestate the Crown pinched a lot and that\nwould be a pity.",
    "Very helpful the excellent M. Croft\nOh he was said Nick warmly.",
    "He got Ellen in and her husband to witness it.",
    "Oh of course What an idiot Ive been\nWe looked at her inquiringly.",
    "Ive been a perfect idiot.",
    "Letting you hunt round End House.",
    "Charles has got it\nof course My cousin Charles Vyse.",
    "138\n\n\fAh so that is the explanation.",
    "Mr Croft said a lawyer was the proper person to have charge of it.",
    "Tr\u00e8s correct ce bon M. Croft.",
    "Men are useful sometimes said Nick.",
    "A lawyer or the Bankthats what he said.",
    "And I said Charles would be best.",
    "So we stuck it in an envelope and sent it off to\nhim straight away.",
    "She lay back on her pillows with a sigh.",
    "Im sorry Ive been so frightfully stupid.",
    "But it is all right now.",
    "Charles has got it\nand if you really want to see it of course hell show it to you.",
    "Not without an authorization from you said Poirot smiling.",
    "How silly.",
    "No Mademoiselle.",
    "Merely prudent.",
    "Well I think its silly.",
    "She took a piece of paper from a little stack that lay beside\nher bed.",
    "What shall I say Let the dog see the rabbit\nComment\nI laughed at his startled face.",
    "He dictated a form of words and Nick wrote obediently.",
    "Thank you Mademoiselle said Poirot as he took it.",
    "Im sorry to have given you such a lot of trouble.",
    "But I really had forgotten.",
    "You\nknow how one forgets things almost at once\nWith order and method in the mind one does not forget.",
    "Ill have to have a course of some kind said Nick.",
    "Youre giving me quite an\ninferiority complex.",
    "139\n\n\fThat is impossible.",
    "Au revoir Mademoiselle.",
    "He looked round the room.",
    "Your\nflowers are lovely.",
    "Arent they The carnations are from Freddie and the roses from George and\nthe lilies from Jim Lazarus.",
    "And look here\nShe pulled the wrapping from a large basket of hothouse grapes by her side.",
    "Poirots face changed.",
    "He stepped forward sharply.",
    "You have not eaten any of them\nNo.",
    "Not yet.",
    "Do not do so.",
    "You must eat nothing Mademoiselle that comes in from outside.",
    "Nothing.",
    "You comprehend\nOh\nShe stared at him the colour ebbing slowly from her face.",
    "I see.",
    "You thinkyou think it isnt over yet.",
    "You think theyre still trying she\nwhispered.",
    "He took her hand.",
    "Do not think of it.",
    "You are safe here.",
    "But remembernothing that comes in from\noutside.",
    "I was conscious of that white frightened face on the pillow as we left the room.",
    "Poirot looked at his watch.",
    "Bon.",
    "We have just time to catch M. Vyse at his office before he leaves it for\nlunch.",
    "On arrival we were shown into Charles Vyses office after the briefest of delays.",
    "The young lawyer rose to greet us.",
    "He was as formal and unemotional as ever.",
    "140\n\n\fGood morning M. Poirot.",
    "What can I do for you\nWithout more ado Poirot presented the letter Nick had written.",
    "He took it and\nread it then gazed over the top of it in a perplexed manner.",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "I really am at a loss to understand\nHas not Mademoiselle Buckley made her meaning clear\nIn this letter he tapped it with his fingernail she asks me to hand over to you\na will made by her and entrusted to my keeping in February last.",
    "Yes Monsieur.",
    "But my dear sir no will has been entrusted to my keeping\nComment\nAs far as I know my cousin never made a will.",
    "I certainly never made one for\nher.",
    "She wrote this herself I understand on a sheet of notepaper and posted it to\nyou.",
    "The lawyer shook his head.",
    "In that case all I can say is that I never received it.",
    "Really M. Vyse\nI never received anything of the kind M. Poirot.",
    "There was a pause then Poirot rose to his feet.",
    "In that case M. Vyse there is nothing more to be said.",
    "There must be some\nmistake.",
    "Certainly there must be some mistake.",

    "Is he lying do you think\nImpossible to tell.",
    "He has the good poker face M. Vyse besides looking as\nthough he had swallowed one.",
    "One thing is clear he will not budge from the\nposition he has taken up.",
    "He never received the will.",
    "That is his point.",
    "Surely Nick will have a written acknowledgment of its receipt.",
    "Cette petite she would never bother her head about a thing like that.",
    "She\ndespatched it.",
    "It was off her mind.",
    "Voil\u00e0.",
    "Besides on that very day she went into\na nursing home to have her appendix out.",
    "She had her emotions in all\nprobability.",
    "Well what do we do now\nParbleu we go and see M. Croft.",
    "Let us see what he can remember about this\nbusiness.",
    "It seems to have been very much his doing.",
    "He didnt profit by it in any way I said thoughtfully.",
    "No.",
    "No I cannot see anything in it from his point of view.",
    "He is probably merely\nthe busybodythe man who likes to arrange his neighbours affairs.",
    "Such an attitude was indeed typical of Mr Croft I felt.",
    "He was the kindly know all\nwho causes so much exasperation in this world of ours.",
    "We found him busy in his shirt sleeves over a steaming pot in the kitchen.",
    "A most\nsavoury smell pervaded the little lodge.",
    "He relinquished his cookery with enthusiasm being clearly eager to talk about\nthe murder.",
    "142\n\n\fHalf a jiffy he said.",
    "Walk upstairs.",

    "I liked her much\nbetter than her husband.",
    "That poor dear girl she said.",
    "In a nursing home you say Had a complete\nbreakdown I shouldnt wonder.",
    "A dreadful business M. Poirotperfectly\ndreadful.",
    "An innocent girl like that shot dead.",
    "It doesnt bear thinking aboutit\ndoesnt indeed.",
    "And no lawless wild part of the world either.",
    "Right here in the\nheart of the old country.",
    "Kept me awake all night it did.",
    "Its made me nervous about going out and leaving you old lady said her\nhusband who had put on his coat and joined us.",
    "I dont like to think of your\nhaving been left all alone here yesterday evening.",
    "It gives me the shivers.",
    "Youre not going to leave me again I can tell you said Mrs Croft.",
    "Not after\ndark anyway.",
    "And Im thinking Id like to leave this part of the world as soon as\npossible.",
    "I shall never feel the same about it.",
    "I shouldnt think poor Nicky Buckley\ncould ever bear to sleep in that house again.",
    "It was a little difficult to reach the object of our visit.",
    "Both Mr and Mrs Croft\ntalked so much and were so anxious to know all about everything.",
    "Were the\npoor dead girls relations coming down When was the funeral Was there to be\nan inquest What did the police think Had they any clue yet Was it true that a\nman had been arrested in Plymouth\nThen having answered all these questions they were insistent on offering us\nlunch.",
    "Only Poirots mendacious statement that we were obliged to hurry back\nto lunch with the Chief Constable saved us.",
    "At last a momentary pause occurred and Poirot got in the question he had been\nwaiting to ask.",
    "Why of course said Mr Croft.",
    "He pulled the blind cord up and down twice\nfrowning at it abstractedly.",
    "I remember all about it.",
    "Must have been when we\nfirst came here.",
    "I remember.",
    "Appendicitisthats what the doctor said\n143\n\n\fAnd probably not appendicitis at all interrupted Mrs Croft.",
    "These doctorsthey\nalways like cutting you up if they can.",
    "It wasnt the kind you have to operate on\nanyhow.",
    "Shed had indigestion and one thing and another and theyd Xrayed\nher and they said out it had better come.",
    "And there she was poor little soul just\ngoing off to one of those nasty Homes.",
    "I just asked her said Mr Croft if shed made a will.",
    "More as a joke than\nanything else.",
    "Yes\nAnd she wrote it out then and there.",
    "Talked about getting a will form at the post\nofficebut I advised her not to.",
    "Lot of trouble they cause sometimes so a man\ntold me.",
    "Anyway her cousin is a lawyer.",
    "He could draw her out a proper one\nafterwards if everything was all rightas of course I knew it would be.",
    "This was\njust a precautionary matter.",
    "Who witnessed it\nOh Ellen the maid and her husband.",
    "And afterwards What was done with it\nOh we posted it to Vyse.",
    "The lawyer you know.",
    "You know that it was posted\nMy dear M. Poirot I posted it myself.",
    "Right in this box here by the gate.",
    "So if M. Vyse says he never got it\nCroft stared.",
    "Do you mean that it got lost in the post Oh but surely thats impossible.",
    "Anyway you are certain that you posted it.",
    "Certain sure said Mr Croft heartily.",
    "Ill take my oath on that any day.",
    "144\n\n\fAh well said Poirot.",
    "Fortunately it does not matter.",
    "Mademoiselle is not likely\nto die just yet awhile.",
    "Et voil\u00e0 said Poirot when we were out of earshot and walking down to the\nhotel.",
    "Who is lying M. Croft Or M. Charles Vyse I must confess I see no\nreason why M. Croft should be lying.",
    "To suppress the will would be of no\nadvantage to himespecially when he had been instrumental in getting it made.",
    "No his statement seems clear enough and tallies exactly with what was told us\nby Mademoiselle Nick.",
    "But all the same\nYes\nAll the same I am glad that M. Croft was doing the cooking when we arrived.",
    "He\nleft an excellent impression of a greasy thumb and first finger on a corner of the\nnewspaper that covered the kitchen table.",
    "I managed to tear it off unseen by\nhim.",
    "We will send it to our good friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard.",
    "There is\njust a chance that he might know something about it.",
    "Yes\nYou know Hastings I cannot help feeling that our genial M. Croft is a little too\ngood to be genuine.",
    "And now he added.",

    "Colonel Weston called upon us soon after lunch.",
    "He was a tall man of military carriage with considerable goodlooks.",
    "He had a\nsuitable reverence for Poirots achievements with which he seemed to be well\nacquainted.",
    "Marvellous piece of luck for us having you down here M. Poirot he said again\nand again.",
    "His one fear was that he should be compelled to call in the assistance of Scotland\nYard.",
    "He was anxious to solve the mystery and catch the criminal without their\naid.",
    "Hence his delight at Poirots presence in the neighbourhood.",
    "Poirot so far as I could judge took him completely into his confidence.",
    "Deuced odd business said the Colonel.",
    "Never heard of anything like it.",
    "Well\nthe girl ought to be safe enough in a nursing home.",
    "Still you cant keep her there\nfor ever\nThat M. le Colonel is just the difficulty.",
    "There is only one way of dealing with it.",
    "And that is\nWe must lay our hands on the person responsible.",
    "If what you suspect is true that isnt going to be so easy.",
    "Ah je le sais bien.",
    "Evidence Getting evidence is going to be the devil.",
    "He frowned abstractedly.",
    "147\n\n\fAlways difficult these cases where theres no routine work.",
    "If we could get hold\nof the pistol\nIn all probability it is at the bottom of the sea.",
    "That is if the murderer had any\nsense.",
    "Ah said Colonel Weston.",
    "But often they havent.",
    "Youd be surprised at the fool\nthings people do.",
    "Im not talking of murderswe dont have many murders down\nin these parts Im glad to saybut in ordinary police court cases.",
    "The sheer damn\nfoolishness of these people would surprise you.",
    "They are of a different mentality though\nYesperhaps.",
    "If Vyse is the chap well well have our work cut out.",

    "We want to keep things dark at present.",
    "He was turning towards the door when he suddenly came back.",
    "Upon my soul Id forgotten the very thing that will interest you most and that I\nwant your opinion about.",
    "Sitting down again he drew from his pocket a torn scrap of paper with writing\non it and handed it to Poirot.",
    "My police found this when they were searching the grounds.",
    "Nor far from where\nyou were all watching the fireworks.",
    "Its the only suggestive thing they did find.",
    "Poirot smoothed it out.",
    "The writing was large and straggling.",
    "...must have money at once.",
    "If not you... what will happen.",
    "Im warning you.",
    "Poirot frowned.",
    "He read and reread it.",
    "148\n\n\fThis is interesting he said.",
    "I may keep it\nCertainly.",
    "There are no fingerprints on it.",
    "Ill be glad if you can make anything of\nit.",
    "Colonel Weston got to his feet again.",
    "I really must be off.",

    "By the way you are not being\ncalled as witnessonly Captain Hastings.",
    "Dont want the newspaper people to get\nwise to your being on the job.",

    "Theyll arrive about\nhalfpast five.",
    "Poor souls.",
    "Im heartily sorry for them.",
    "They are taking the body\nback with them the following day.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "Unpleasant business.",
    "Im not enjoying this M. Poirot.",
    "Who could M. le Colonel It is as you say an unpleasant business.",
    "When he had gone Poirot examined the scrap of paper once more.",
    "An important clue I asked.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders.",
    "How can one tell There is a hint of blackmail about it Someone of our party\nthat night was being pressed for money in a very unpleasant way.",
    "Of course it is\npossible that it was one of the strangers.",
    "He looked at the writing through a little magnifying glass.",
    "Does this writing look at all familiar to you Hastings\nIt reminds me a little of somethingAh I have itthat note of Mrs Rices.",
    "149\n\n\fYes said Poirot slowly.",
    "There are resemblances.",
    "Decidedly there are\nresemblances.",
    "It is curious.",
    "Yet I do not think that this is the writing of Madame\nRice.",
    "Come in he said as a knock came at the door.",
    "It was Commander Challenger.",
    "Just looked in he explained.",
    "Wanted to know if you were any further forward.",
    "Parbleu said Poirot.",
    "At this moment I am feeling that I am considerably further\nback.",
    "I seem to progressen reculant.",
    "Thats bad.",
    "But I dont really believe it M. Poirot.",
    "Ive been hearing all about you\nand what a wonderful chap you are.",
    "Never had a failure they say.",
    "That is not true said Poirot.",
    "I had a bad failure in Belgium in 1893.",
    "You\nrecollect Hastings I recounted it to you.",
    "The affair of the box of chocolates.",
    "I remember I said.",
    "And I smiled for at the time that Poirot told me that tale he had instructed me\nto say chocolate box to him if ever I should fancy he was growing conceited He\nwas then bitterly offended when I used the magical words only a minute and a\nquarter later.",
    "Oh well said Challenger that is such a long time ago it hardly counts.",
    "You are\ngoing to get to the bottom of this arent you\nThat I swear.",
    "On the word of Hercule Poirot.",
    "I am the dog who stays on the\nscent and does not leave it.",
    "Good.",
    "Got any ideas\nI have suspicions of two people.",
    "I suppose I mustnt ask you who they are\nI should not tell you You see I might possibly be in error.",
    "My alibi is satisfactory I trust said Challenger with a faint twinkle.",
    "150\n\n\fPoirot smiled indulgently at the bronzed face in front of him.",
    "You left Devonport\nat a few minutes past 8.30.",
    "You arrived here at five minutes past tentwenty\nminutes after the crime had been committed.",
    "But the distance from Devonport\nis only just over thirty miles and you have often done it in an hour since the road\nis good.",
    "So you see your alibi is not good at all\nWell Im\nYou comprehend I inquire into everything.",
    "Your alibi as I say is not good.",
    "But\nthere are other things beside alibis.",
    "You would like I think to marry\nMademoiselle Nick\nThe sailors face flushed.",
    "Ive always wanted to marry her he said huskily.",
    "Precisely.",
    "Eh bien Mademoiselle Nick was engaged to another man.",
    "A reason\nperhaps for killing the other man.",
    "But that is unnecessaryhe dies the death of a\nhero.",
    "So it is truethat Nick was engaged to Michael Seton Theres a rumour to that\neffect all over the town this morning.",
    "Yesit is interesting how soon news spreads.",
    "You never suspected it before\nI knew Nick was engaged to someoneshe told me so two days ago.",
    "But she\ndidnt give me a clue as to whom it was.",
    "It was Michael Seton.",
    "Entre nous he has left her I fancy a very pretty fortune.",
    "Ah assuredly it is not a moment for killing Mademoiselle Nickfrom your point\nof view.",
    "She weeps for her lover now but the heart consoles itself.",
    "She is young.",
    "And I think Monsieur that she is very fond of you...",
    "Challenger was silent for a moment or two.",
    "If it should be... he murmured.",
    "There was a tap on the door.",
    "151\n\n\fIt was Frederica Rice.",
    "Ive been looking for you she said to Challenger.",
    "They told me you were here.",
    "I\nwanted to know if youd got my wristwatch back yet.",
    "Oh yes I called for it this morning.",
    "He took it from his pocket and handed it to her.",
    "It was a watch of rather an\nunusual shaperound like a globe set on a strap of plain black moir\u00e9.",
    "I\nremembered that I had seen one much the same shape on Nick Buckleys wrist.",
    "I hope it will keep better time now.",
    "Its rather a bore.",
    "Something is always going wrong with it.",
    "It is for beauty Madame and not for utility said Poirot.",
    "Cant one have both She looked from one to the other of us.",
    "Am I interrupting\na conference\nNo indeed Madame.",
    "We were talking gossipnot the crime.",
    "We were saying\nhow quickly news spreadshow that everyone now knows that Mademoiselle\nNick was engaged to that brave airman who perished.",
    "So Nick was engaged to Michael Seton exclaimed Frederica.",
    "It surprises you Madame\nIt does a little.",
    "I dont know why.",
    "Certainly I did think he was very taken with her\nlast autumn.",
    "They went about a lot together.",
    "And then after Christmas they\nboth seemed to cool off.",
    "As far as I know they hardly met.",
    "The secret they kept it very well.",
    "That was because of old Sir Matthew I suppose.",
    "He was really a little off his\nhead I think.",
    "You had no suspicion Madame And yet Mademoiselle was such an intimate\nfriend.",
    "152\n\n\fNicks a close little devil when she likes murmured Frederica.",
    "But I understand\nnow why shes been so nervy lately.",
    "Oh and I ought to have guessed from\nsomething she said only the other day.",
    "Your little friend is very attractive Madame.",
    "Old Jim Lazarus used to think so at one time said Challenger with his loud\nrather tactless laugh.",
    "Oh Jim She shrugged her shoulders but I thought she was annoyed.",
    "She turned to Poirot.",
    "Tell me M. Poirot did you\nShe stopped.",
    "Her tall figure swayed and her face turned whiter still.",
    "Her eyes\nwere fixed on the centre of the table.",
    "You are not well Madame.",
    "I pushed forward a chair helped her to sink into it.",
    "She shook her head\nmurmured Im all right and leaned forward her face between her hands.",
    "We\nwatched her awkwardly.",
    "She sat up in a minute.",
    "How absurd George darling dont look so worried.",
    "Lets talk about murders.",
    "Something exciting.",
    "I want to know if M. Poirot is on the track.",
    "It is early to say Madame said Poirot noncommittally.",
    "But you have ideasyes\nPerhaps.",
    "But I need a great deal more evidence.",
    "Oh She sounded uncertain.",
    "Suddenly she rose.",
    "153\n\n\fIve got a head.",
    "I think Ill go and lie down.",
    "Perhaps tomorrow theyll let me see\nNick.",
    "She left the room abruptly.",
    "Challenger frowned.",
    "You never know what that womans up to.",
    "Nick may have been fond of her but I\ndont believe she was fond of Nick.",
    "But there you cant tell with women.",
    "Its\ndarlingdarlingdarlingall the timeand damn you would probably express it\nmuch better.",
    "Are you going out M. Poirot For Poirot had risen and was\ncarefully brushing a speck off his hat.",
    "Yes I am going into the town.",
    "Ive got nothing to do.",
    "May I come with you.",
    "Assuredly.",
    "It will be a pleasure.",
    "We left the room.",
    "Poirot with an apology went back.",
    "My stick he explained as he rejoined us.",
    "Challenger winced slightly.",
    "And indeed the stick with its embossed gold band\nwas somewhat ornate.",
    "Poirots first visit was to a florist.",
    "I must send some flowers to Mademoiselle Nick he explained.",
    "He proved difficult to suit.",
    "In the end he chose an ornate gold basket to be filled with orange carnations.",
    "The whole to be tied up with a large blue bow.",
    "The shopwoman gave him a card and he wrote on it with a flourish With the\nCompliments of Hercule Poirot.",
    "I sent her some flowers this morning said Challenger.",
    "I might send her some\nfruit.",
    "154\n\n\fInutile said Poirot.",
    "What\nI said it was useless.",
    "The eatableit is not permitted.",
    "Who says so\nI say so.",
    "I have made the rule.",
    "It has already been impressed on Mademoiselle\nNick.",
    "She understands.",
    "Good Lord said Challenger.",
    "He looked thoroughly startled.",
    "He stared at Poirot curiously.",
    "So thats it is it he said.",
    "Youre stillafraid.",
    "155\n\n\f156\n\n\fChapter 16\nInterview with Mr Whitfield\nThe inquest was a dry proceedingmere bare bones.",
    "There was evidence of\nidentification then I gave evidence of the finding of the body.",
    "Medical evidence\nfollowed.",

    "Now that Seton was dead and due tribute had been paid to his memory a new\nsensation was due.",
    "The St Loo Mystery was a godsend to papers at their wits\nend for news in the month of August.",
    "After the inquest having successfully dodged reporters I met Poirot and we had\nan interview with the Rev.",
    "Giles Buckley and his wife.",
    "Maggies father and mother were a charming pair completely unworldly and\nunsophisticated.",
    "Mrs Buckley was a woman of character tall and fair and showing very plainly her\nnorthern ancestry.",
    "Her husband was a small man greyhaired with a diffident\nappealing manner.",
    "Poor souls they were completely dazed by the misfortune that had overtaken\nthem and robbed them of a wellbeloved daughter.",
    "Our Maggie as they called\nher.",
    "I can scarcely realize it even now said Mr Buckley.",
    "Such a dear child M. Poirot.",
    "So quiet and unselfishalways thinking of others.",

    "He assures us that\neverything is being done to find the man who did this thing.",
    "He must be a\nmadman.",
    "No other explanation is possible.",
    "Madame I cannot tell you how I sympathize with you in your lossand how I\nadmire your bravery\nBreaking down would not bring Maggie back to us said Mrs Buckley sadly.",
    "My wife is wonderful said the clergyman.",
    "Her faith and courage are greater\nthan mine.",

    "I knowI know Monsieur.",
    "You are a great detective M. Poirot said Mrs Buckley.",
    "It has been said Madame.",
    "Oh I know.",
    "Even in our remote country village we have heard of you.",

    "Poor little Nick said Mrs Buckley.",
    "I am really sorriest of all for her.",
    "I had a most\npathetic letter.",

    "That is morbid said Mr Buckley.",
    "158\n\n\fYes but I know how she feels.",
    "I wish they would let me see her.",
    "It seems so\nextraordinary not to let her own family visit her.",
    "Doctors and nurses are very strict said Poirot evasively.",
    "They make the rulessoand nothing will change them.",
    "And doubtless they fear for her the emotionthe natural emotionshe would experience on seeing you.",
    "Perhaps said Mrs Buckley doubtfully.",
    "But I dont hold with nursing homes.",
    "Nick would do much better if they let her come back with meright away from\nthis place.",

    "I Hercule\nPoirot was on the spot and I did not prevent the crime\nNobody could have prevented it.",

    "No ordinary person could have\nprevented itbut of what good is it to be Hercule Poirot with grey cells of a finer\nquality than other peoples if you do not manage to do what ordinary people\ncannot\nWell of course I said.",
    "If you are going to put it like that\nYes indeed.",
    "I am abased downheartedcompletely abased.",
    "I reflected that Poirots abasement was strangely like other peoples conceit but\nI prudently forbore from making any remark.",
    "And now he said en avant.",
    "To London.",
    "London\nMais oui.",
    "We shall catch the two oclock train very comfortably.",
    "All is peaceful\nhere.",

    "160\n\n\fHe was a very urbane and impressive person.",
    "He had in front of him a letter from\nthe Chief Constable and another from some high official at Scotland Yard.",
    "This is all very irregular and unusual M.ahPoirot he said as he polished his\neyeglasses.",
    "Quite so M. Whitfield.",
    "But then murder is also irregularand I am glad to say\nsufficiently unusual.",
    "True.",
    "True.",
    "But rather farfetchedto make a connection between this murder\nand my late clients bequesteh\nI think not.",
    "Ah you think not.",
    "Wellunder the circumstancesand I must admit that Sir\nHenry puts it very strongly in his letterI shall beerhappy to do anything that is\nin my power.",
    "You acted as legal adviser to the late Captain Seton\nTo all the Seton family my dear sir.",

    "Parfaitement.",
    "The late Sir Matthew Seton made a will\nWe made it for him.",
    "And he left his fortunehow\nThere were several bequestsone to the Natural History Museumbut the bulk of\nhis largehis I may say very large fortune he left to Captain Michael Seton\nabsolutely.",
    "He had no other near relations.",
    "A very large fortune you say\nThe late Sir Matthew was the second richest man in England replied Mr\nWhitfield composedly.",
    "161\n\n\fHe had somewhat peculiar views had he not Mr Whitfield looked at him\nseverely.",
    "A millionaire M. Poirot is allowed to be eccentric.",
    "It is almost expected of him.",
    "Poirot received his correction meekly and asked another question.",
    "His death was unexpected I understand\nMost unexpected.",
    "Sir Matthew enjoyed remarkably good health.",
    "He had an\ninternal growth however which no one had suspected.",
    "It reached a vital tissue\nand an immediate operation was necessary.",
    "The operation was as always on\nthese occasions completely successful.",
    "But Sir Matthew died.",
    "And his fortune passed to Captain Seton.",
    "That is so.",
    "Captain Seton had I understand made a will before leaving England\nIf you can call it a willyes said Mr Whitfield with strong distaste.",
    "It is legal\nIt is perfectly legal.",
    "The intention of the testator is plain and it is properly\nwitnessed.",
    "Oh yes it is legal.",
    "But you do not approve of it\nMy dear sir what are we for\nI had often wondered.",
    "Having once had occasion to make a perfectly simple will\nmyself.",
    "I had been appalled at the length and verbiage that resulted from my\nsolicitors office.",
    "The truth of the matter was continued Mr Whitfield that at the time Captain\nSeton had little or nothing to leave.",
    "He was dependent on the allowance he\nreceived from his uncle.",
    "He felt I suppose that anything would do.",
    "162\n\n\fAnd had thought correctly I whispered to myself.",
    "And the terms of this will asked Poirot.",
    "He leaves everything of which he dies possessed to his affianced wife Miss\nMagdala Buckley absolutely.",
    "He names me as his executor.",
    "Then Miss Buckley inherits\nCertainly Miss Buckley inherits.",
    "And if Miss Buckley had happened to die last Monday\nCaptain Seton having predeceased her the money would go to whomever she\nhad named in her will as residuary legateeor failing a will to her next of kin.",
    "I may say added Mr Whitfield with an air of enjoyment that death duties\nwould have been enormous.",
    "Enormous Three deaths remember in rapid\nsuccession.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "Enormous\nBut there would have been something left murmured Poirot meekly.",

    "Poirot rose.",
    "Thank you Mr Whitfield very much for the information that you have given\nme.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I may say that I shall be in communication with Miss\nBuckleyindeed I believe the letter has already gone.",

    "163\n\n\fGoodbye M. Poirot.",
    "Glad to have been of service to you.",
    "Your name isahfamiliar to me.",
    "He said this kindlywith an air of one making a valuable admission.",
    "It is all exactly as you thought Poirot I said when we were outside.",
    "Mon ami it was bound to be.",
    "It could not be any other way.",
    "We will go now to\nthe Cheshire Cheese where Japp meets us for an early dinner.",
    "We found Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard awaiting us at the chosen rendezvous.",
    "He greeted Poirot with every sign of warmth.",
    "Years since Ive seen you Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Thought you were growing vegetable\nmarrows in the country.",
    "I tried Japp I tried.",
    "But even when you grow vegetable marrows you cannot get\naway from murder.",
    "He sighed.",
    "I knew of what he was thinkingthat strange affair at Fernley Park.",
    "How I regretted that I had been far away at that time.",
    "And Captain Hastings too said Japp.",
    "How are you sir\nVery fit thanks I said.",
    "And now there are more murders continued Japp facetiously.",
    "As you saymore murders.",
    "Well you mustnt be depressed old cock said Japp.",
    "Even if you cant see your\nway clearwellyou cant go about at your time of life and expect to have the\nsuccess you used to do.",
    "We all of us get stale as the years go by.",
    "Got to give the\nyoung uns a chance you know.",
    "And yet the old dog is the one who knows the tricks murmured Poirot.",
    "He is\ncunning.",
    "He does not leave the scent.",
    "Oh wellwere talking about human beings not dogs.",
    "164\n\n\fIs there so much difference\nWell it depends how you look at things.",
    "But youre a caution isnt he Captain\nHastings Always was.",
    "Looks much the samehair a bit thinner on top but the\nface fungus fuller than ever.",
    "Eh said Poirot.",
    "What is that\nHes congratulating you on your moustaches I said soothingly.",
    "They are luxuriant yes said Poirot complacently caressing them.",
    "Japp went off into a roar of laughter.",
    "Well he said after a minute or two Ive done your bit of business.",
    "Those\nfingerprints you sent me\nYes said Poirot eagerly.",
    "Nothing doing.",
    "Whoever the gentleman may behe hasnt passed throughour\nhands.",
    "On the other hand I wired to Melbourne and nobody of that description\nor name is known there.",
    "Ah\nSo there may be something fishy after all.",
    "But hes not one of the lads.",
    "As to the other business went on Japp.",
    "Yes\nLazarus and Son have a good reputation.",
    "Quite straight and honourable in their\ndealings.",
    "Sharp of coursebut thats another matter.",

    "I am much obliged to you.",
    "Not at all.",
    "That sort of thing isnt my line as you know.",
    "But I made a point of\nfinding out as you wanted to know.",
    "We can always get information.",
    "My good Japp what should I do without you\nOh thats all right.",
    "Always glad to oblige an old friend.",
    "I let you in on some\npretty good cases in the old days didnt I\nThis I realized was Japps way of acknowledging indebtedness to Poirot who\nhad solved many a case which had baffled the inspector.",
    "They were the good daysyes.",
    "I wouldnt mind having a chat with you now and again even in these days.",
    "Your\nmethods may be oldfashioned but youve got your head screwed on the right\nway M. Poirot.",

    "Why Dr MacAllister I asked bewildered.",
    "I had never heard of the name.",
    "Where does he come in\nDr MacAllister is the uncle of Commander Challenger explained Poirot.",
    "You\nremember he referred to an uncle who was a doctor\nHow thorough you are I said.",
    "Did you think he had operated on Sir Matthew\n166\n\n\fHes not a surgeon said Japp.",
    "Mon ami said Poirot I like to inquire into everything.",
    "Hercule Poirot is a good\ndog.",
    "The good dog follows the scent and if regrettably there is no scent to\nfollow he noses aroundseeking always something that is not very nice.",
    "So also\ndoes Hercule Poirot.",
    "And oftenOh so oftendoes he find it\nIts not a nice profession ours said Japp.",
    "Stilton did you say I dont mind if I\ndo.",

    "It is impossibleimpossible.",

    "For another hour we walked the streets of St Loo.",
    "I did my best to distract\nPoirots mindpointing out to him that all was well that after all no mischief\nhad been done.",
    "But he only shook his head and repeated at intervals I am afraid Hastings I am\nafraid...\nAnd the strange way he said it made me too feel afraid.",
    "Once he caught me by the arm.",
    "Listen my friend.",
    "I am all wrong.",
    "I have been all wrong from the beginning.",
    "You mean it isnt the money\nNo no I am right about that.",

    "The nurse came\nforward.",
    "You want the card that was in the box\nYes please nurse.",
    "There was a moments pause.",
    "The nurse returned to the room with it in her\nhand.",
    "Here it is.",
    "I gasped.",
    "So did Poirot.",
    "For on the card in flourishing handwriting were written\nthe same words that I had seen Poirot inscribe on the card that accompanied the\nbasket of flowers.",
    "With the Compliments of Hercule Poirot.",
    "Sacr\u00e9 tonnerre\nYou see said Nick accusingly.",
    "I did not write this cried Poirot.",

    "172\n\n\fI know.",
    "Its exactly the same as the card that came with the orange carnations.",
    "I\nnever doubted that the chocolates came from you.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "How should you doubt Oh the devil The clever cruel devil To think of that\nAh but he has genius this man genius With the Compliments of Hercule\nPoirot.",
    "So simple.",
    "Yes but one had to think of it.",
    "And II did not think.",

    "Do not agitate yourself Mademoiselle.",
    "You are blamelessblameless.",
    "It is I that\nam to blame miserable imbecile that I am I should have foreseen this move.",
    "Yes I should have foreseen it.",
    "His chin dropped on his breast.",

    "I really think said the nurse.",
    "She had been hovering nearby a disapproving expression on her face.",
    "Eh Yes yes I will go.",
    "Courage Mademoiselle.",
    "This is the last mistake I will\nmake.",
    "I am ashamed desolatedI have been tricked outwittedas though I were\na little schoolboy.",

    "No.",
    "I promise you.",
    "Come\nHastings.",
    "Poirots first proceeding was to interview the matron.",
    "She was naturally terribly\nupset over the whole business.",
    "It seems incredible to me M. Poirot absolutely incredible.",
    "That a thing like that\nshould happen in my nursing home.",
    "Poirot was sympathetic and tactful.",
    "Having soothed her sufficiently he began to\ninquire into the circumstance of the arrival of the fatal packet.",
    "Here the matron\ndeclared he would do best to interview the orderly who had been on duty at the\ntime of its arrival.",
    "173\n\n\fThe man in question whose name was Hood was a stupid but honestlooking\nyoung fellow of about twentytwo.",
    "He looked nervous and frightened.",
    "Poirot put\nhim at his ease however.",
    "No blame can be attached to you he said kindly.",
    "But I want you to tell me\nexactly when and how this parcel arrived.",
    "The orderly looked puzzled.",
    "Its difficult to say sir he said slowly.",
    "Lots of people come and inquire and\nleave things for the different patients.",
    "The nurse says this came last night I said.",
    "About six oclock.",
    "The lads face brightened.",
    "I do remember now sir.",
    "A gentleman brought it.",
    "A thinfaced gentlemanfairhaired\nHe was fairhairedbut I dont know about thinfaced.",
    "Would Charles Vyse bring it himself I murmured to Poirot.",
    "I had forgotten that the lad would know a local name.",
    "It wasnt Mr Vyse he said.",
    "I know him.",
    "It was a bigger gentlemanhandsomelookingcame in a big car.",
    "Lazarus I exclaimed.",
    "Poirot shot me a warning glance and I regretted my precipitance.",
    "He came in a large car and he left this parcel.",
    "It was addressed to Miss Buckley\nYes sir.",
    "And what did you do with it\nI didnt touch it sir.",
    "Nurse took it up.",
    "174\n\n\fQuite so but you touched it when you took it from the gentleman nest ce pas\nOh that yes of course sir.",
    "I took it from him and put it on the table.",
    "Which table Show me if you please.",
    "The orderly led us into the hall.",
    "The front door was open.",
    "Close to it in the hall\nwas a long marbletopped table on which lay letters and parcels.",
    "Everything that comes is put on here sir.",
    "Then the nurses take things up to the\npatients.",
    "Do you remember what time this parcel was left\nMust have been about fivethirty or a little after.",
    "I know the post had just been\nand thats usually at about halfpast five.",
    "It was a pretty busy afternoon a lot of\npeople leaving flowers and coming to see patients.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Now I think we will see the nurse who took up the parcel.",
    "This proved to be one of the probationers a fluffy little person all agog with\nexcitement.",
    "She remembered taking the parcel up at six oclock when she came\non duty.",
    "Six oclock murmured Poirot.",
    "Then it must have been twenty minutes or so\nthat the parcel was lying on the table downstairs.",
    "Pardon\nNothing Mademoiselle.",
    "Continue.",
    "You took the parcel to Miss Buckley\nYes there were several things for her.",
    "There was this box and some flowers\nalsosweet peasfrom a Mr and Mrs Croft I think.",
    "I took them up at the same\ntime.",
    "And there was a parcel that had come by postand curiously enough that\nwas a box of Fullers chocolates also.",
    "Comment A second box\n\n175\n\n\fYes rather a coincidence.",
    "Miss Buckley opened them both.",
    "She said Oh what\na shame.",
    "Im not allowed to eat them.",
    "Then she opened the lids to look inside\nand see if they were both just the same and your card was in one and she said\nTake the other impure box away nurse.",
    "I might have got them mixed up.",
    "Oh\ndear whoever would have thought of such a thing Seems like an Edgar Wallace\ndoesnt it\nPoirot cut short this flood of speech.",
    "Two boxes you say From whom was the other box\nThere was no name inside.",
    "And which was the one that camethat had the appearance of comingfrom me\nThe one by post or the other\nI declare nowI cant remember.",
    "Shall I go up and ask Miss Buckley\nIf you would be so amiable.",
    "She ran up the stairs.",
    "Two boxes murmured Poirot.",
    "There is confusion for you.",
    "The nurse returned breathless.",
    "Miss Buckley isnt sure.",
    "She unwrapped them both before she looked inside.",
    "But\nshe thinks it wasnt the box that came by post.",
    "Eh said Poirot a little confused.",
    "The box from you was the one that didnt come by post.",
    "At least she thinks so\nbut she isnt quite sure.",
    "Diable said Poirot as we walked away.",
    "Is no one ever quite sure In detective\nbooksyes.",
    "But lifereal lifeis always full of muddle.",
    "Am I sure myself about\nanything at all No noa thousand times no.",
    "Lazarus I said.",
    "176\n\n\fYes that is a surprise is it not\nShall you say anything to him about it\nAssuredly.",
    "I shall be interested to see how he takes it.",
    "By the way we might as\nwell exaggerate the serious condition of Mademoiselle.",
    "It will do no harm to let\nit be assumed that she is at deaths door.",
    "You comprehend The solemn faceyes admirable.",
    "You resemble closely an undertaker.",
    "Cest tout \u00e0 fait bien.",
    "We were lucky in finding Lazarus.",
    "He was bending over the bonnet of his car\noutside the hotel.",
    "Poirot went straight up to him.",
    "Yesterday evening Monsieur Lazarus you left a box of chocolates for\nMademoiselle he began without preamble.",
    "Lazarus looked rather surprised.",
    "Yes\nThat was very amiable of you.",
    "As a matter of fact they were from Freddie from Mrs Rice.",
    "She asked me to get\nthem.",
    "Oh I see.",

    "Tell me did you send her a box of\nchocolates yesterday\nYes.",
    "At least she asked me to get them for her.",
    "She asked you to get them for her\nYes.",
    "But she was not allowed to see anyone.",
    "How did you see her\nI didnt.",
    "She telephoned.",
    "Ah And she saidwhat\nWould I get her a twopound box of Fullers chocolates.",
    "How did her voice soundweak\nNonot at all.",
    "Quite strong.",
    "But different somehow.",
    "I didnt realize it was she\nspeaking at first.",
    "Until she told you who she was\nYes.",
    "Are you sure Madame that it was your friend\nFrederica looked startled.",
    "IIwhy of course it was.",
    "Who else could it have been\nThat is an interesting question Madame.",
    "You dont mean\nCould you swear Madame that it was your friends voiceapart from what she\nsaid\n\n178\n\n\fNo said Frederica slowly I couldnt.",
    "Her voice was certainly different.",
    "I\nthought it was the phoneor perhaps being ill...",
    "If she had not told you who she was you would not have recognized it\nNo no I dont think I should.",
    "Who was it M. Poirot Who was it\nThat is what I mean to know Madame.",
    "The graveness of his face seemed to awaken her suspicions.",

    "It is not I that make a mistakeeven though my name was in the box.",
    "She stared at him blankly.",
    "If Mademoiselle Nick dies he said and made a threatening gesture with his\nhand.",
    "She gave a low cry.",
    "He turned away and taking me by the arm went up to the sittingroom.",
    "He flung his hat on the table.",

    "From beginning to end she is an enigma.",
    "And that forces me to a conclusion.",
    "Either Madame Rice is guiltyor she knowsor shall we say thinks she knowswho is guilty.",

    "One thing at least is to the good.",
    "If the owner of that face overheard our\nconversation we did not mention that Mademoiselle Nick was alive and well.",
    "Whatever else our visitor may have heard that at least escaped him.",
    "But surely I said the results of thisehbrilliant manoeuvre of yours have been\nslightly disappointing up to date.",

    "You were right.",
    "I suppose this is the will making Frederica\nRice residuary legatee\nM. Vyse said nothing about the contents of the will.",

    "I\nshall send today a telegram asking two questionsbut the answers to them I\nknow alreadyI know here He tapped his forehead.",
    "And when you receive the answers I asked curiously.",
    "He sprang to his feet.",
    "My friend do you remember that Mademoiselle Nick said she wanted to stage a\nplay at End House Tonight we stage such a play in End House.",
    "But it will be a\nplay produced by Hercule Poirot.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick will have a part to play in\nit.",
    "He grinned suddenly.",
    "You comprehend Hastings there will be a ghost in this play.",
    "Yes a ghost.",
    "End\nHouse has never seen a ghost.",
    "It will have one tonight.",
    "Noas I tried to ask a\nquestionI will say no more.",
    "Tonight Hastings we will produce our comedyand\nreveal the truth.",
    "But now there is much to domuch to do.",
    "He hurried from the room.",
    "196\n\n\fChapter 19\nPoirot Produces a Play\nIt was a curious gathering that met that night at End House.",
    "I had hardly seen Poirot all day.",
    "He had been out for dinner but had left me a\nmessage that I was to be at End House at nine oclock.",
    "Evening dress he had\nadded was not necessary.",
    "The whole thing was like a rather ridiculous dream.",
    "On arrival I was ushered into the diningroom and when I looked round I realized\nthat every person on Poirots list from A. to I. J. was necessarily excluded being\nin the Mrs Harrislike position of there aint no such person was present.",
    "Even Mrs Croft was there in a kind of invalid chair.",
    "She smiled and nodded at me.",
    "This is a surprise isnt it she said cheerfully.",
    "It makes a change for me I must\nsay.",
    "I think I shall try and get out now and again.",
    "All M. Poirots idea.",
    "Come and\nsit by me Captain Hastings.",
    "Somehow I feel this is rather a gruesome businessbut Mr Vyse made a point of it.",
    "Mr Vyse I said rather surprised.",
    "Charles Vyse was standing by the mantelpiece.",
    "Poirot was beside him talking\nearnestly to him in an undertone.",
    "I looked round the room.",
    "Yes they were all there.",
    "After showing me in I had\nbeen a minute or two late Ellen had taken her place on a chair just beside the\ndoor.",
    "On another chair sitting painfully straight and breathing hard was her\nhusband.",
    "The child Alfred squirmed uneasily between his father and mother.",
    "The rest sat round the diningtable.",
    "Frederica in her black dress Lazarus beside\nher George Challenger and Croft on the other side of the table.",
    "I sat a little away\nfrom it near Mrs Croft.",
    "And now Charles Vyse a final nod of the head took his\nplace at the head of the table and Poirot slipped unobtrusively into a seat next\nto Lazarus.",
    "197\n\n\fClearly the producer as Poirot had styled himself did not propose to take a\nprominent part in the play.",
    "Charles Vyse was apparently in charge of the\nproceedings.",
    "I wondered what surprises Poirot had in store for him.",
    "The young lawyer cleared his throat and stood up.",
    "He looked just the same as\never impassive formal and unemotional.",
    "This is rather an unconventional gathering we have here tonight he said.",
    "But\nthe circumstances are very peculiar.",
    "I refer of course to the circumstances\nsurrounding the death of my cousin Miss Buckley.",
    "There will have of course to\nbe an autopsythere seems to be no doubt that she met her death by poison\nand that that poison was administered with the intent to kill.",
    "This is police\nbusiness and I need not go into it.",
    "The police would doubtless prefer me not to\ndo so.",
    "In an ordinary case the will of a deceased person is read after the funeral but in\ndeference to M. Poirots special wish I am proposing to read it before the\nfuneral takes place.",
    "In fact I am proposing to read it here and now.",
    "That is why\neveryone has been asked to come here.",
    "As I said just now the circumstances are\nunusual and justify a departure from precedent.",
    "The will itself came into my possession in a somewhat unusual manner.",
    "Although dated last February it only reached me by post this morning.",
    "However\nit is undoubtedly in the handwriting of my cousinI have no doubt on that point\nand though a most informal document it is properly attested.",
    "He paused and cleared his throat once more.",
    "Every eye was upon his face.",
    "From a long envelope in his hand he drew out an enclosure.",
    "It was as we could\nsee an ordinary piece of End House notepaper with writing on it.",
    "It is quite short said Vyse.",
    "He made a suitable pause then began to read\nThis is the last Will and Testament of Magdala Buckley.",
    "I direct that all my\nfuneral expenses should be paid and I appoint my cousin Charles Vyse as my\nexecutor.",
    "I leave everything of which I die possessed to Mildred Croft in grateful\n198\n\n\frecognition of the services rendered by her to my father Philip Buckley which\nservices nothing can ever repay.",
    "SignedMagdala Buckley\nWitnessesEllen Wilson William Wilson.",
    "I was dumbfounded So I think was everyone else.",
    "Only Mrs Croft nodded her\nhead in quiet understanding.",
    "Its true she said quietly.",
    "Not that I ever meant to let on about it.",
    "Philip\nBuckley was out in Australia and if it hadnt been for mewell Im not going into\nthat.",
    "A secret its been and a secret it had better remain.",
    "She knew about it\nthough.",
    "Nick did I mean.",
    "Her father must have told her.",
    "We came down here\nbecause we wanted to have a look at the place.",
    "Id always been curious about\nthis End House Philip Buckley talked of.",
    "And that dear girl knew all about it and\ncouldnt do enough for us.",
    "Wanted us to come and live with her she did.",
    "But we\nwouldnt do that.",
    "And so she insisted on our having the lodgeand not a penny of\nrent would she take.",
    "We pretended to pay it of course so as not to cause talk\nbut she handed it back to us.",
    "And nowthis Well if anyone says there is no\ngratitude in the world Ill tell them theyre wrong This proves it.",
    "There was still an amazed silence.",
    "Poirot looked at Vyse.",
    "Had you any idea of this\nVyse shook his head.",
    "I knew Philip Buckley had been in Australia.",
    "But I never heard any rumours of a\nscandal there.",
    "He looked inquiringly at Mrs Croft.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "No you wont get a word out of me.",
    "I never have said a word and I never shall.",
    "The secret goes to the grave with me.",
    "Vyse said nothing.",
    "He sat quietly tapping the table with a pencil.",
    "199\n\n\fI presume M. VysePoirot leaned forwardthat as next of kin you could contest\nthat will There is I understand a vast fortune at stake which was not the case\nwhen the will was made.",
    "Vyse looked at him coldly.",
    "The will is perfectly valid.",
    "I should not dream of contesting my cousins disposal\nof her property.",
    "Youre an honest fellow said Mrs Croft approvingly.",
    "And Ill see you dont lose\nby it.",
    "Charles sank a little from this wellmeant but slightly embarrassing remark.",
    "Well Mother said Mr Croft with an elation he could not quite keep out of his\nvoice.",
    "This is a surprise Nick didnt tell me what she was doing.",
    "The dear sweet girl murmured Mrs Croft putting her handkerchief to her eyes.",
    "I wish she could look down and see us now.",
    "Perhaps she doeswho knows\nPerhaps agreed Poirot.",
    "Suddenly an idea seemed to strike him.",
    "He looked round.",
    "An idea We are all here seated round a table.",
    "Let us hold a s\u00e9ance.",
    "A s\u00e9ance said Mrs Croft somewhat shocked.",
    "But surely\nYes yes it will be most interesting.",
    "Hastings here has pronounced mediumistic\npowers.",
    "Why fix on me I thought.",
    "To get through a message from the other\nworldthe opportunity is unique I feel the conditions are propitious.",
    "You feel the\nsame Hastings.",
    "Yes I said resolutely playing up.",
    "Good.",
    "I knew it.",
    "Quick the lights.",
    "In another minute he had risen and switched them off.",
    "The whole thing had\nbeen rushed on the company before they had had the energy to protest had\n200\n\n\fthey wanted to do so.",
    "As a matter of fact they were I think still dazed with\nastonishment over the will.",
    "The room was not quite dark.",
    "The curtains were drawn back and the window\nwas open for it was a hot night and through those windows came a faint light.",
    "After a minute or two as we sat in silence I began to be able to make out the\nfaint outlines of the furniture.",
    "I wondered very much what I was supposed to do\nand cursed Poirot heartily for not having given me my instructions beforehand.",
    "However I closed my eyes and breathed in a rather stertorous manner.",
    "Presently Poirot rose and tiptoed to my chair.",
    "Then returning to his own he\nmurmured.",
    "Yes he is already in a trance.",
    "Soonthings will begin to happen.",
    "There is something about sitting in the dark waiting that fills one with\nunbearable apprehension.",
    "I know that I myself was a prey to nerves and so I was\nsure was everyone else.",
    "And yet I had at least an idea of what was about to\nhappen.",
    "I knew the one vital fact that no one else knew.",
    "And yet in spite of all that my heart leapt into my mouth as I saw the diningroom door slowly opening.",
    "It did so quite soundlessly it must have been oiled and the effect was horribly\ngrisly.",
    "It swung slowly open and for a minute or two that was all.",
    "With its\nopening a cold blast of air seemed to enter the room.",
    "It was I suppose a\ncommon or garden draught owing to the open window but it felt like the icy\nchill mentioned in all the ghost stories I have ever read.",
    "And then we all saw it Framed in the doorway was a white shadowy figure.",
    "Nick\nBuckley...\nShe advanced slowly and noiselesslywith a kind of floating ethereal motion that\ncertainly conveyed the impression of nothing human...\n\n201\n\n\fI realized then what an actress the world had missed.",
    "Nick had wanted to play a\npart at End House.",
    "Now she was playing it and I felt convinced that she was\nenjoying herself to the core.",
    "She did it perfectly.",
    "She floated forward into the roomand the silence was broken.",
    "There was a gasping cry from the invalid chair beside me.",
    "A kind of gurgle from\nMr Croft.",
    "A startled oath from Challenger.",
    "Charles Vyse drew back his chair I\nthink.",
    "Lazarus leaned forward.",
    "Frederica alone made no sound or movement.",
    "And then a scream rent the room.",
    "Ellen sprang up from her chair.",
    "Its her she shrieked.",
    "Shes come back.",
    "Shes walking Them thats murdered\nalways walks.",
    "Its her Its her\nAnd then with a click the lights went on.",
    "I saw Poirot standing by them the smile of the ringmaster on his face.",
    "Nick stood\nin the middle of the room in her white draperies.",
    "It was Frederica who spoke first.",
    "She stretched out an unbelieving handtouched\nher friend.",
    "Nick she said.",
    "Youreyoure real\nIt was almost a whisper.",
    "Nick laughed.",
    "She advanced.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "Im real enough.",
    "Thank you so much for what you did for my\nfather Mrs Croft.",
    "But Im afraid you wont be able to enjoy the benefit of that\nwill just yet.",
    "Oh my God gasped Mrs Croft.",
    "Oh my God.",
    "She twisted to and fro in her\nchair.",
    "Take me away Bert.",
    "Take me away.",
    "It was all a joke my dearall a joke\nthats all it was.",
    "Honest.",
    "A queer sort of joke said Nick.",
    "202\n\n\fThe door had opened again and a man had entered so quietly that I had not\nheard him.",
    "To my surprise I saw that it was Japp.",
    "He exchanged a quick nod with\nPoirot as though satisfying him of something.",
    "Then his face suddenly lit up and\nhe took a step forward towards the squirming figure in the invalid chair.",
    "Helloelloello he said.",
    "Whats this An old friend Milly Merton I declare And\nat your old tricks again my dear.",
    "He turned round in an explanatory way to the company disregarding Mrs Crofts\nshrill protests.",
    "Cleverest forger weve ever had Milly Merton.",
    "We knew there had been an\naccident to the car they made their last getaway in.",
    "But there Even an injury to\nthe spine wouldnt keep Milly from her tricks.",
    "Shes an artist she is\nWas that will a forgery said Vyse.",
    "He spoke in tones of amazement.",
    "Of course it was a forgery said Nick scornfully.",
    "You dont think Id make a silly\nwill like that do you I left you End House Charles and everything else to\nFrederica.",
    "She crossed as she spoke and stood by her friend and just at that moment it\nhappened\nA spurt of flame from the window and the hiss of a bullet.",
    "Then another and the\nsound of a groan and a fall outside...\nAnd Frederica on her feet with a thin trickle of blood running down her arm...\n\n203\n\n\f204\n\n\fChapter 20\nJ.",
    "It was all so sudden that for a moment no one knew what had happened.",
    "Then with a violent exclamation Poirot ran to the window.",
    "Challenger was with\nhim.",
    "A moment later they reappeared carrying with them the limp body of a man.",
    "As\nthey lowered him carefully into a big leather armchair and his face came into\nview I uttered a cry.",
    "The facethe face at the window...",
    "It was the man I had seen looking in on us the previous evening.",
    "I recognized him\nat once.",
    "I realized that when I had said he was hardly human I had exaggerated\nas Poirot had accused me of doing.",
    "Yet there was something about his face that justified my impression.",
    "It was a lost\nfacethe face of one removed from ordinary humanity.",
    "White weak depravedit seemed a mere maskas though the spirit within had\nfled long ago.",
    "Down the side of it there trickled a stream of blood.",
    "Frederica came slowly forward till she stood by the chair.",
    "Poirot intercepted her.",
    "You are hurt Madame\nShe shook her head.",
    "The bullet grazed my shoulderthat is all.",
    "She put him aside with a gentle hand and bent down.",
    "205\n\n\fThe mans eyes opened and he saw her looking down at him.",
    "Ive done for you this time I hope he said in a low vicious snarl and then his\nvoice changing suddenly till it sounded like a childs Oh Freddie I didnt mean\nit.",
    "I didnt mean it.",
    "Youve always been so decent to me...\nIts all right\nShe knelt down beside him.",
    "I didnt mean\nHis head dropped.",
    "The sentence was never finished.",
    "Frederica looked up at Poirot.",
    "Yes Madame he is dead he said gently.",
    "She rose slowly from her knees and stood looking down at him.",
    "With one hand\nshe touched his foreheadpitifully it seemed.",
    "Then she sighed and turned to the\nrest of us.",
    "He was my husband she said quietly.",
    "J. I murmured.",
    "Poirot caught my remark and nodded a quick assent.",
    "Yes he said softly.",
    "Always I felt that there was a J. I said so from the beginning\ndid I not\nHe was my husband said Frederica again.",
    "Her voice was terribly tired.",
    "She sank\ninto a chair that Lazarus brought for her.",
    "I might as well tell you everythingnow.",
    "He wascompletely debased.",
    "He was a drug fiend.",
    "He taught me to take drugs.",
    "I\nhave been fighting the habit ever since I left him.",
    "I thinkat lastI am nearly\ncured.",
    "But it has been difficult.",
    "Oh so horribly difficult.",
    "Nobody knows how\ndifficult\n206\n\n\fI could never escape from him.",
    "He used to turn up and demand moneywith\nthreats.",
    "A kind of blackmail.",
    "If I did not give him money he would shoot himself.",
    "That was always his threat.",
    "Then he took to threatening to shoot me.",
    "He was not\nresponsible.",
    "He was madcrazy...",
    "I suppose it was he who shot Maggie Buckley.",
    "He didnt mean to shoot her of\ncourse.",
    "He must have thought it was me.",
    "I ought to have said I suppose.",
    "But after all I wasnt sure.",
    "And those queer\naccidents Nick hadthat made me feel that perhaps it wasnt him after all.",
    "It\nmight have been someone quite different.",
    "And thenone dayI saw a bit of his handwriting on a torn piece of paper on M.\nPoirots table.",
    "It was part of a letter he had sent me.",
    "I knew then that M. Poirot\nwas on the track.",
    "Since then I have felt that it was only a matter of time...",
    "But I dont understand about the sweets.",
    "He wouldnt have wanted to poison\nNick.",
    "And anyway I dont see how he could have had anything to do with that.",
    "Ive puzzled and puzzled.",
    "She put both hands to her face then took them away and said with a queer\npathetic finality Thats all\u2026\n\n207\n\n\f208\n\n\fChapter 21\nThe PersonK.",
    "Lazarus came quickly to her side.",
    "My dear he said.",

    "She handed the glass back to him and smiled.",
    "Im all right now she said.",
    "Whatwhat had we better do next\nShe looked at Japp but the Inspector shook his head.",
    "Im on a holiday Mrs Rice.",
    "Just obliging an old friendthats all Im doing.",
    "The St Loo police are in charge of\nthe case.",

    "Best thing to do from Challenger.",
    "Lets forget everything thats passed in this room tonight.",
    "This very\ndeterminedly from Croft.",

    "So you are seven to one.",
    "The good Japp is neutral.",
    "Im on holiday said Japp with a grin.",
    "I dont count.",
    "Seven to one.",
    "Only M. Vyse holds outon the side of law and order You know\nM. Vyse you are a man of character\nVyse shrugged his shoulders.",
    "The position is quite clear.",
    "There is only one thing to do.",
    "Yesyou are an honest man.",
    "Eh bien I too range myself on the side of the\nminority.",
    "I too am for the truth.",
    "M. Poirot cried Nick.",

    "Silenced by his imperious attitude we sat down meekly and turned attentive\nfaces towards him.",
    "Ecoutez I have a list herea list of persons connected with the crime.",
    "I\nnumbered them with the letters of the alphabet including the letter J. J. stood\nfor a person unknownlinked to the crime by one of the others.",
    "I did not know\nwho J. was until tonight but I knew that there was such a person.",
    "The events of\ntonight have proved that I was right.",
    "But yesterday I suddenly realized that I had made a grave error.",
    "I had made an\nomission.",
    "I added another letter to my list.",
    "The letter K.\n\n211\n\n\fAnother person unknown asked Vyse with a slight sneer.",
    "Not exactly.",
    "I adopted J. as the symbol for a person unknown.",
    "Another person\nunknown would be merely another J. K. has a different significance.",
    "It stands for\na person who should have been included in the original list but who was\noverlooked.",
    "He bent over Frederica.",
    "Reassure yourself Madame.",
    "Your husband was not guilty of murder.",
    "It was the\nperson K. who shot Mademoiselle Maggie.",
    "She stared.",
    "But who is K.\nPoirot nodded to Japp.",
    "He stepped forward and spoke in tones reminiscent of\nthe days when he had given evidence in police courts.",
    "Acting on information received I took up a position here early in the evening\nhaving been introduced secretly into the house by M. Poirot.",
    "I was concealed\nbehind the curtains in the drawingroom.",
    "When everyone was assembled in this\nroom a young lady entered the drawingroom and switched on the light.",
    "She\nmade her way to the fireplace and opened a small recess in the panelling that\nappeared to be operated with a spring.",
    "She took from the recess a pistol.",
    "With\nthis in her hand she left the room.",
    "I followed her and opening the door a crack I\nwas able to observe her further movements.",

    "The young lady carefully wiped the pistol with a\nhandkerchief and then placed it in the pocket of a grey wrap the property of\nMrs Rice\nA cry burst from Nick.",
    "This is untrueevery word of it\nPoirot pointed a hand at her.",
    "212\n\n\fVoil\u00e0 he said.",
    "The person K. It was Mademoiselle Nick who shot her cousin\nMaggie Buckley.",
    "Are you mad cried Nick.",
    "Why should I kill Maggie\nIn order to inherit the money left to her by Michael Seton Her name too was\nMagdala Buckleyand it was to her he was engagednot you.",
    "Youyou\nShe stood there tremblingunable to speak.",
    "Poirot turned to Japp.",
    "You telephoned to the police\nYes they are waiting in the hall now.",
    "Theyve got the warrant.",
    "Youre all mad cried Nick contemptuously.",
    "She moved swiftly to Fredericas\nside.",
    "Freddie give me your wristwatch asas a souvenir will you\nSlowly Frederica unclasped the jewelled watch from her wrist and handed it to\nNick.",
    "Thanks.",
    "And nowI suppose we must go through with this perfectly ridiculous\ncomedy.",
    "The comedy you planned and produced in End House.",
    "Yesbut you should not\nhave given the star part to Hercule Poirot.",
    "That Mademoiselle was your\nmistakeyour very grave mistake.",
    "213\n\n\f214\n\n\fChapter 22\nThe End of the Story\nYou want me to explain\nPoirot looked round with a gratified smile and the air of mock humility I knew so\nwell.",
    "We had moved into the drawingroom and our numbers had lessened.",
    "The\ndomestics had withdrawn tactfully and the Crofts had been asked to accompany\nthe police.",
    "Frederica Lazarus Challenger Vyse and I remained.",
    "Eh bienI confess itI was fooledfooled completely and absolutely.",
    "The little\nNick she had me where she wanted me as your idiom so well expresses it.",
    "Ah\nMadame when you said that your friend was a clever little liarhow right you\nwere How right\nNick always told lies said Frederica composedly.",
    "Thats why I didnt really\nbelieve in these marvellous escapes of hers.",
    "And Iimbecile that I wasdid\nDidnt they really happen I asked.",
    "I was I admit still hopelessly confused.",
    "They were inventedvery cleverlyto give just the impression they did.",
    "What was that\nThey gave the impression that Mademoiselle Nicks life was in danger.",
    "But I will\nbegin earlier than that.",
    "I will tell you the story as I have pieced it outnot as it\ncame to me imperfectly and in flashes.",
    "At the beginning of the business then we have this girl this Nick Buckley young\nand beautiful unscrupulous and passionately and fanatically devoted to her\nhome.",
    "Charles Vyse nodded.",
    "215\n\n\fI told you that.",
    "And you were right.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick loved End House.",
    "But she had no\nmoney.",
    "The house was mortgaged.",

    "He meets Maggie and falls in love with her at first sight.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick is dumbfounded.",
    "Her cousin Maggie whom she has never\nconsidered pretty But to young Seton she is different.",
    "The one girl in the\nworld for him.",
    "They become secretly engaged.",
    "Only one person knowshas to\nknow.",
    "That person is Mademoiselle Nick.",
    "The poor Maggieshe is glad that there\nis one person she can talk to.",
    "Doubtless she reads to her cousin parts of her\nfianc\u00e9s letters.",
    "So it is that Mademoiselle gets to hear of the will.",
    "She pays no\nattention to it at the time.",
    "But it remains in her mind.",
    "Then comes the sudden and unexpected death of Sir Matthew Seton and hard\nupon that the rumours of Michael Setons being missing.",
    "And straightaway an\noutrageous plan comes into our young ladys head.",
    "Seton does not know that\nher name is Magdala also.",
    "He only knows her as Nick.",
    "His will is clearly quite\ninformala mere mention of a name.",
    "But in the eyes of the world Seton is her\nfriend It is with her that his name has been coupled.",
    "If she were to claim to be\nengaged to him no one would be surprised.",
    "But to do that successfully Maggie\nmust be out of the way.",
    "Time is short.",
    "She arranges for Maggie to come and stay in a few days time.",
    "Then she has her escapes from death.",
    "The picture whose cord she cuts through.",
    "The brake of the car that she tampers with.",
    "The boulderthat perhaps was\nnatural and she merely invented the story of being underneath on the path.",
    "And thenshe sees my name in the paper.",
    "I told you Hastings everyone knew\nHercule Poirot and she has the audacity to make me an accomplice The bullet\nthrough the hat that falls at my feet.",
    "Oh the pretty comedy.",
    "And I am taken in I\n216\n\n\fbelieve in the peril that menaces her Bon She has got a valuable witness on her\nside.",
    "I play into her hands by asking her to send for a friend.",
    "She seizes the chance and sends for Maggie to come a day earlier.",
    "How easy the crime is actually She leaves us at the dinner table and after\nhearing on the wireless that Setons death is a fact she starts to put her plan\ninto action.",
    "She has plenty of time then to take Setons letters to Maggielook\nthrough them and select the few that will answer her purpose.",
    "These she places\nin her own room.",
    "Then later she and Maggie leave the fireworks and go back to\nthe house.",
    "She tells her cousin to put on her shawl.",
    "Then stealing out after her\nshe shoots her.",
    "Quick into the house the pistol concealed in the secret panel of\nwhose existence she thinks nobody knows.",
    "Then upstairs.",
    "There she waits till\nvoices are heard.",
    "The body is discovered.",
    "It is her cue.",
    "Down she rushes and out through the window.",
    "How well she played her part Magnificently Oh yes she staged a fine drama\nhere.",
    "The maid Ellen said this was an evil house.",
    "I am inclined to agree with her.",
    "It was from the house that Mademoiselle Nick took her inspiration.",
    "But those poisoned sweets said Frederica.",
    "I still dont understand about that.",
    "It was all part of the same scheme.",
    "Do you not see that if Nicks life was\nattempted after Maggie was dead that absolutely settled the question that\nMaggies death had been a mistake.",
    "When she thought the time was ripe she rang up Madame Rice and asked her to\nget her a box of chocolates.",
    "Then it was her voice\nBut yes How often the simple explanation is the true one Nest ce pas She\nmade her voice sound a little differentthat was all.",
    "So that you might be in\ndoubt when questioned.",
    "Then when the box arrivedagain how simple.",
    "She fills\nthree of the chocolates with cocaine she had cocaine with her cleverly\nconcealed eats one of them and is illbut not too ill. She knows very well how\nmuch cocaine to take and just what symptoms to exaggerate.",
    "217\n\n\fAnd the cardmy card Ah Sapristi she has a nerve It was my cardthe one I\nsent with the flowers.",
    "Simple was it not Yes but it had to be thought of...",
    "There was a pause and then Frederica asked Why did she put the pistol in my\ncoat\nI thought you would ask me that Madame.",
    "It was bound to occur to you in time.",
    "Tell mehad it ever entered your head that Mademoiselle Nick no longer liked\nyou Did you ever feel that she mighthate you\nIts difficult to say said Frederica slowly.",
    "We lived an insincere life.",
    "She used to\nbe fond of me.",
    "Tell me M. Lazarusit is not a time for false modesty you understandwas there\never anything between you and her\nNo.",
    "Lazarus shook his head.",
    "I was attracted to her at one time.",
    "And thenI dont\nknow whyI went off her.",
    "Ah said Poirot nodding his head sagely.",
    "That was her tragedy.",
    "She attracted\npeopleand then they went off her.",
    "Instead of liking her better and better you\nfell in love with her friend.",
    "She began to hate MadameMadame who had a rich\nfriend behind her.",
    "Last winter when she made a will she was fond of Madame.",
    "Later it was different.",
    "She remembered that will.",
    "She did not know that Croft had suppressed itthat it\nhad never reached its destination.",
    "Madame or so the world would say had got\na motive for desiring her death.",
    "So it was to Madame she telephoned asking her\nto get the chocolates.",
    "Tonight the will would have been read naming Madame\nher residuary legateeand then the pistol would be found in her coatthe pistol\nwith which Maggie Buckley was shot.",
    "If Madame found it she might incriminate\nherself by trying to get rid of it.",
    "She must have hated me murmured Frederica.",
    "Yes Madame.",
    "You had what she had notthe knack of winning love and keeping\nit.",
    "218\n\n\fIm rather dense said Challenger but I havent quite fathomed the will\nbusiness yet.",
    "No Thats a different business altogethera very simple one.",
    "The Crofts are\nlying low down here.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick has to have an operation.",
    "She has made\nno will.",
    "The Crofts see a chance.",
    "They persuade her to make one and take charge\nof it for the post.",
    "Then if anything happens to herif she diesthey produce a\ncleverly forged willleaving the money to Mrs Croft with a reference to Australia\nand Philip Buckley whom they know once visited the country.",
    "But Mademoiselle Nick has her appendix removed quite satisfactorily so the\nforged will is no good.",
    "For the moment that is.",
    "Then the attempts on her life\nbegin.",
    "The Crofts are hopeful once more.",
    "Finally I announce her death.",
    "The\nchance is too good to be missed.",
    "The forged will is immediately posted to M.\nVyse.",
    "Of course to begin with they naturally thought her much richer than she\nis.",
    "They knew nothing about the mortgage.",
    "What I really want to know M. Poirot said Lazarus is how you actually got\nwise to all this.",
    "When did you begin to suspect\nAh there I am ashamed.",
    "I was so longso long.",
    "There were things that worried\nmeyes.",
    "Things that seemed not quite right.",
    "Discrepancies between what\nMademoiselle Nick told me and what other people told me.",
    "Unfortunately I\nalways believed Mademoiselle Nick.",
    "And then suddenly I got a revelation.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick made one mistake.",
    "She was too clever.",
    "When I urged her to send for a friend she promised to do soand suppressed the fact that she had already sent for Mademoiselle Maggie.",
    "It\nseemed to her less suspiciousbut it was a mistake.",
    "For Maggie Buckley wrote a letter home immediately on arrival and in it she\nused one innocent phrase that puzzled me I dont see why Nick should have\ntelegraphed for me the way she did.",
    "Tuesday would have done just as well.",
    "What did that mention of Tuesday mean It could only mean one thing.",
    "Maggie\nhad been coming to stay on Tuesday anyway.",
    "But in that case Mademoiselle Nick\nhad liedor had at any rate suppressed the truth.",
    "219\n\n\fAnd for the first time I looked at her in a different light.",
    "I criticized her\nstatements.",
    "Instead of believing them I said Suppose this were not true.",
    "I\nremembered the discrepancies.",
    "How would it be if every time it was\nMademoiselle Nick who was lying and not the other person\nI said to myself Let us be simple.",
    "What has really happened\nAnd I saw that what had really happened was that Maggie Buckley had been\nkilled.",
    "Just that But who could want Maggie Buckley dead\nAnd then I thought of something elsea few foolish remarks that Hastings had\nmade not five minutes before.",
    "He had said that there were plenty of\nabbreviations for MargaretMaggie Margot etc.",
    "And it suddenly occurred to me\nto wonder what was Mademoiselle Maggies real name\nThen tout dun coup it came to me Supposing her name was Magdala It was a\nBuckley name Mademoiselle Nick had told me so.",
    "Two Magadala Buckleys.",
    "Supposing...",
    "In my mind I ran over the letters of Michael Setons that I had read.",
    "Yesthere\nwas nothing impossible.",
    "There was a mention of Scarboroughbut Maggie had\nbeen in Scarborough with Nickher mother had told me so.",
    "And it explained one thing which had worried me.",
    "Why were there so few\nletters If a girl keeps her love letters at all she keeps all of them.",
    "Why these\nselect few Was there any peculiarity about them\nAnd I remembered that there was no name mentioned in them.",
    "They all began\ndifferentlybut they began with a term of endearment.",
    "Nowhere in them was\nthere the nameNick.",
    "And there was something else something that I ought to have seen at oncethat\ncried the truth aloud.",
    "What was that\nWhythis.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick underwent an operation for appendicitis on\nFebruary 27th last.",
    "There is a letter of Michael Setons dated March 2nd and no\n220\n\n\fmention of anxiety of illness or anything unusal.",
    "That ought to have shown me\nthat the letters were written to a different person altogether.",
    "Then I went through a list of questions that I had made.",
    "And I answered them in\nthe light of my new idea.",
    "In all but a few isolated questions the result was simple and convincing.",
    "And I\nanswered too another question which I had asked myself earlier.",
    "Why did\nMademoiselle Nick buy a black dress The answer was that she and her cousin\nhad to be dressed alike with the scarlet shawl as an additional touch.",
    "That was\nthe true and convincing answer not the other.",
    "A girl would not buy mourning\nbefore she knew her lover was dead.",
    "She would be unrealunnatural.",
    "And so I in turn staged my little drama.",
    "And the thing I hoped for happened\nNick Buckley had been very vehement about the question of a secret panel.",
    "She\nhad declared there was no such thing.",
    "But if there wereand I did not see why\nEllen should have invented itNick must know of it.",
    "Why was she so vehement\nWas it possible that she had hidden the pistol there With the secret intention of\nusing it to throw suspicion on somebody later\nI let her see that appearances were very black against Madame.",
    "That was as she\nhad planned.",
    "As I foresaw she was unable to resist the crowning proof.",
    "Besides\nit was safer for herself.",
    "That secret panel might be found by Ellen and the pistol\nin it\nWe are all safely in here.",
    "She is waiting outside for her cue.",
    "It is absolutely safe\nshe thinks to take the pistol from its hiding place and put it in Madames coat...\nAnd soat the lastshe failed...\nFrederica shivered.",
    "All the same she said.",
    "Im glad I gave her my watch.",
    "Yes Madame.",
    "She looked up at him quickly.",
    "221\n\n\fYou know about that too\nWhat about Ellen I asked breaking in.",
    "Did she know or suspect anything\nNo.",
    "I asked her.",
    "She told me that she decided to stay in the house that night\nbecause in her own phrase she thought something was up.",
    "Apparently Nick\nurged her to see the fireworks rather too decisively.",
    "She had fathomed Nicks\ndislike of Madame.",
    "She told me that she felt in her bones something was going\nto happen but she thought it was going to happen to Madame.",
    "She knew Miss\nNicks temper she said and she was always a queer little girl.",
    "Yes murmured Frederica.",
    "Yes let us think of her like that.",
    "A queer little girl.",
    "A\nqueer little girl who couldnt help herself...",
    "I shallanyway.",
    "Poirot took her hand and raised it gently to his lips.",
    "Charles Vyse stirred uneasily.",
    "Its going to be a very unpleasant business he said quietly.",
    "I must see about\nsome kind of defence for her I suppose.",
    "There will be no need I think said Poirot gently.",
    "Not if I am correct in my\nassumptions.",
    "He turned suddenly on Challenger.",
    "Thats where you put the stuff isnt it he said.",
    "In those wristwatches.",
    "II The sailor stammeredat a loss.",
    "Do not try and deceive mewith your hearty goodfellow manner.",
    "It has\ndeceived Hastingsbut it does not deceive me.",
    "You make a good thing out of it\ndo you notthe traffic in drugsyou and your uncle in Harley Street.",
    "M. Poirot.",
    "Challenger rose to his feet.",
    "My little friend blinked up at him placidly.",
    "222\n\n\fYou are the useful boy friend.",
    "Deny it if you like.",
    "But I advise you if you do\nnot want the facts put in the hands of the policeto go.",
    "And to my utter amazement Challenger did go.",
    "He went from the room like a\nflash.",
    "I stared after him openmouthed.",
    "Poirot laughed.",
    "I told you so mon ami.",
    "Your instincts are always wrong.",
    "Cest \u00e9patant\nCocaine was in the wristwatch I began.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "That is how Mademoiselle Nick had it with her so conveniently at the\nnursing home.",
    "And having finished her supply in the chocolate box she asked\nMadame just now for hers which was full.",
    "You mean she cant do without it\nNon non.",
    "Mademoiselle Nick is not a addict.",
    "Sometimesfor funthat is all.",
    "But\ntonight she needed it for a different purpose.",
    "It will be a full dose this time.",
    "You mean I gasped.",
    "It is the best way.",
    "Better than the hangmans rope.",
    "But pst we must not say so\nbefore M. Vyse who is all for law and order.",
    "Officially I know nothing.",
    "The\ncontents of the wristwatchit is the merest guess on my part.",
    "Your guesses are always right M. Poirot said Frederica.",
    "I must be going said Charles Vyse cold disapproval in his attitude as he left the\nroom.",
    "Poirot looked from Frederica to Lazarus.",
    "You are going to get marriedeh\nAs soon as we can.",
    "223\n\n\fAnd indeed M. Poirot said Frederica.",
    "I am not the drugtaker you think.",
    "I have\ncut myself down to a tiny dose.",
    "I think nowwith happiness in front of meI shall\nnot need a wristwatch any more.",
    "I hope you will have happiness Madame said Poirot.",
    "gently.",
    "You have suffered\na great deal.",
    "And in spite of everything you have suffered you have still the\nquality of mercy in your heart...",
    "I will look after her said Lazarus.",
    "My business is in a bad way but I believe I\nshall pull through.",
    "And if I dontwell Frederica does not mind being poorwith\nme.",
    "She shook her head smiling.",
    "It is late said Poirot looking at the clock.",
    "We all rose.",
    "We have spent a strange night in this strange house Poirot went on.",
    "It is I\nthink as Ellen says an evil house...",
    "He looked up at the picture of old Sir Nicholas.",
    "Then with a sudden gesture he drew Lazarus aside.",
    "I ask your pardon but of all my questions there is one still unanswered.",
    "Tell\nme why did you offer fifty pounds for that picture It would give me much\npleasure to knowso as you comprehend to leave nothing unanswered.",
    "Lazarus looked at him with an impassive face for a minute or two.",
    "Then he\nsmiled.",
    "You see M. Poirot he said.",
    "I am a dealer.",
    "Exactly.",
    "That picture is not worth a penny more than twenty pounds.",
    "I knew that if I\noffered Nick fifty she would immediately suspect it was worth more and would\nget it valued elsewhere.",
    "Then she would find that I had offered her far more\n224\n\n\fthan it was worth.",
    "The next time I offered to buy a picture she would not have\ngot it valued.",
    "Yes and then\nThe picture on the far wall is worth at least five thousand pounds said Lazarus\ndrily.",
    "Ah Poirot drew a long breath.",
    "Now I know everything he said happily.",
    "225"
