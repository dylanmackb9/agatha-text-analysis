    "\u201cLots of chaps gabbing away who know nothing about the place Now I\nspent fourteen years of my life there.",
    "Some of the best years of my life too\n\u2014\u201d\nOld Miss Marple inclined her head.",
    "It was a gentle gesture of courtesy.",
    "Whilst Major Palgrave proceeded\nwith the somewhat uninteresting recollections of a lifetime Miss Marple\npeacefully pursued her own thoughts.",
    "It was a routine with which she was\nwell acquainted.",
    "The locale varied.",
    "In the past it had been predominantly\nIndia.",
    "Majors Colonels LieutenantGenerals\u2014and a familiar series of\nwords Simla.",
    "Bearers.",
    "Tigers.",
    "Chota Hazri\u2014Tiffin.",

    "With Major Palgrave the terms were slightly different.",
    "Safari.",
    "Kikuyu.",
    "Elephants.",
    "Swahili.",
    "But the pattern was essentially the same.",
    "An elderly\nman who needed a listener so that he could in memory relive days in\nwhich he had been happy.",
    "Days when his back had been straight his\neyesight keen his hearing acute.",
    "Some of these talkers had been handsome\nsoldierly old boys some again had been regrettably unattractive and Major\nPalgrave purple of face with a glass eye and the general appearance of a\nstuffed frog belonged in the latter category.",
    "Miss Marple had bestowed on all of them the same gentle charity.",
    "She\nhad sat attentively inclining her head from time to time in gentle\nagreement thinking her own thoughts and enjoying what there was to\nenjoy in this case the deep blue of a Caribbean Sea.",
    "So kind of dear Raymond\u2014she was thinking gratefully so really and\ntruly kind \u2026 Why he should take so much trouble about his old aunt she\nreally did not know.",
    "Conscience perhaps family feeling Or possibly he\nwas truly fond of her\u2026.",
    "She thought on the whole that he was fond of her\u2014he always had been\n\u2014in a slightly exasperated and contemptuous way Always trying to bring\nher up to date.",
    "Sending her books to read.",
    "Modern novels.",
    "So difficult\u2014all\nabout such unpleasant people doing such very odd things and not\napparently even enjoying them.",
    "\u201cSex\u201d as a word had not been mentioned in\nMiss Marple\u2019s young days but there had been plenty of it\u2014not talked\nabout so much\u2014but enjoyed far more than nowadays or so it seemed to\nher.",
    "Though usually labelled Sin she couldn\u2019t help feeling that that was\npreferable to what it seemed to be nowadays\u2014a kind of Duty.",
    "Her glance strayed for a moment to the book on her lap lying open at\npage twentythree which was as far as she had got and indeed as far as she\nfelt like getting.",
    "\u201c\u2018Do you mean that you\u2019ve had no sexual experience at ALL\u2019\ndemanded the young man incredulously.",
    "\u2018At nineteen But you\nmust.",
    "It\u2019s vital.\u2019\n\u201cThe girl hung her head unhappily her straight greasy hair fell\nforward over her face.",
    "\u201c\u2018I know\u2019 she muttered \u2018I know.\u2019\n\u201cHe looked at her stained old jersey the bare feet the dirty toe\nnails the smell of rancid fat \u2026 He wondered why he found her so\nmaddeningly attractive.\u201d\nMiss Marple wondered too And really To have sex experience urged\non you exactly as though it was an iron tonic Poor young things\u2026.",
    "\u201cMy dear Aunt Jane why must you bury your head in the sand like a\nvery delightful ostrich All bound up in this idyllic rural life of yours.",
    "REAL\nLIFE\u2014that\u2019s what matters.\u201d\nThus Raymond\u2014and his Aunt Jane\u2014had looked properly abashed\u2014\nand said \u201cYes\u201d she was afraid she was rather oldfashioned.",
    "Though really rural life was far from idyllic.",
    "People like Raymond were\nso ignorant.",
    "In the course of her duties in a country parish Jane Marple had\nacquired quite a comprehensive knowledge of the facts of rural life.",
    "She had\nno urge to talk about them far less to write about them\u2014but she knew\nthem.",
    "Plenty of sex natural and unnatural.",
    "Rape incest perversion of all\n\n\fkinds.",
    "Some kinds indeed that even the clever young men from Oxford\nwho wrote books didn\u2019t seem to have heard about.",
    "Miss Marple came back to the Caribbean and took up the thread of what\nMajor Palgrave was saying\u2026.",
    "\u201cA very unusual experience\u201d she said encouragingly.",
    "\u201cMost\ninteresting.\u201d\n\u201cI could tell you a lot more.",
    "Some of the things of course not fit for a\nlady\u2019s ears\u2014\u201d\nWith the ease of long practice Miss Marple dropped her eyelids in a\nfluttery fashion and Major Palgrave continued his bowdlerized version of\ntribal customs whilst Miss Marple resumed her thoughts of her affectionate\nnephew.",
    "Raymond West was a very successful novelist and made a large income\nand he conscientiously and kindly did all he could to alleviate the life of his\nelderly aunt.",
    "The preceding winter she had had a bad go of pneumonia and\nmedical opinion had advised sunshine.",
    "In lordly fashion Raymond had\nsuggested a trip to the West Indies.",
    "Miss Marple had demurred\u2014at the\nexpense the distance the difficulties of travel and at abandoning her house\nin St. Mary Mead.",
    "Raymond had dealt with everything.",
    "A friend who was\nwriting a book wanted a quiet place in the country.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019ll look after the\nhouse all right.",
    "He\u2019s very house proud.",
    "He\u2019s a queer.",
    "I mean\u2014\u201d\nHe had paused slightly embarrassed\u2014but surely even dear old Aunt\nJane must have heard of queers.",
    "He went on to deal with the next points.",
    "Travel was nothing nowadays.",
    "She would go by air\u2014another friend Diana Horrocks was going out to\nTrinidad and would see Aunt Jane was all right as far as there and at St.\nHonor\u00e9 she would stay at the Golden Palm Hotel which was run by the\nSandersons.",
    "Nicest couple in the world.",
    "They\u2019d see she was all right.",
    "He\u2019d\nwrite to them straight away.",
    "As it happened the Sandersons had returned to England.",
    "But their\nsuccessors the Kendals had been very nice and friendly and had assured\nRaymond that he need have no qualms about his aunt.",
    "There was a very\ngood doctor on the island in case of emergency and they themselves would\nkeep an eye on her and see to her comfort.",
    "They had been as good as their word too.",

    "She had\ngreeted the old lady warmly and did everything to make her comfortable.",
    "Tim Kendal her husband lean dark and in his thirties had also been\nkindness itself.",
    "So there she was thought Miss Marple far from the rigours of the\nEnglish climate with a nice bungalow of her own with friendly smiling\nWest Indian girls to wait on her Tim Kendal to meet her in the dining room\nand crack a joke as he advised her about the day\u2019s menu and an easy path\nfrom her bungalow to the sea front and the bathing beach where she could\nsit in a comfortable basket chair and watch the bathing.",
    "There were even a\nfew elderly guests for company.",
    "Old Mr. Rafiel Dr. Graham Canon\nPrescott and his sister and her present cavalier Major Palgrave.",
    "What more could an elderly lady want\nIt is deeply to be regretted and Miss Marple felt guilty even admitting it\nto herself but she was not as satisfied as she ought to be.",
    "Lovely and warm yes\u2014and so good for her rheumatism\u2014and beautiful\nscenery though perhaps\u2014a trifle monotonous So many palm trees.",
    "Everything the same every day\u2014never anything happening.",
    "Not like St.\nMary Mead where something was always happening.",
    "Her nephew had once\ncompared life in St. Mary Mead to scum on a pond and she had indignantly\npointed out that smeared on a slide under the microscope there would be\nplenty of life to be observed.",
    "Yes indeed in St. Mary Mead there was\nalways something going on.",
    "Incident after incident flashed through Miss\nMarple\u2019s mind the mistake in old Mrs. Linnett\u2019s cough mixture\u2014that very\nodd behaviour of young Polegate\u2014the time when Georgy Wood\u2019s mother\nhad come down to see him\u2014but was she his mother\u2014 the real cause of\nthe quarrel between Joe Arden and his wife.",
    "So many interesting human\nproblems\u2014giving rise to endless pleasurable hours of speculation.",
    "If only\nthere were something here that she could\u2014well\u2014get her teeth into.",
    "With a start she realized that Major Palgrave had abandoned Kenya for\nthe North West Frontier and was relating his experiences as a subaltern.",
    "Unfortunately he was asking her with great earnestness \u201cNow don\u2019t you\nagree\u201d\nLong practice had made Miss Marple quite an adept at dealing with that\none.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t really feel that I\u2019ve got sufficient experience to judge.",
    "I\u2019m\nafraid I\u2019ve led rather a sheltered life.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so you should dear lady so you should\u201d cried Major Palgrave\ngallantly.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve had such a very varied life\u201d went on Miss Marple determined\nto make amends for her former pleasurable inattention.",
    "\u201cNot bad\u201d said Major Palgrave complacently.",
    "\u201cNot bad at all.\u201d He\nlooked round him appreciatively.",
    "\u201cLovely place this.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed\u201d said Miss Marple and was then unable to stop herself\ngoing on \u201cDoes anything ever happen here I wonder\u201d\nMajor Palgrave stared.",
    "\u201cOh rather.",
    "Plenty of scandals\u2014eh what Why I could tell you\u2014\u201d\nBut it wasn\u2019t really scandals Miss Marple wanted.",
    "Nothing to get your\nteeth into in scandals nowadays.",
    "Just men and women changing partners\nand calling attention to it instead of trying decently to hush it up and be\nproperly ashamed of themselves.",
    "\u201cThere was even a murder here a couple of years ago.",
    "Man called Harry\nWestern.",
    "Made a big splash in the papers.",
    "Dare say you remember it.\u201d\nMiss Marple nodded without enthusiasm.",
    "It had not been her kind of\nmurder.",
    "It had made a big splash mainly because everyone concerned had\nbeen very rich.",
    "It had seemed likely enough that Harry Western had shot the\nCount de Ferrari his wife\u2019s lover and equally likely that his wellarranged\nalibi had been bought and paid for.",
    "Everyone seemed to have been drunk\nand there was a fine scattering of dope addicts.",
    "Not really interesting\npeople thought Miss Marple\u2014although no doubt very spectacular and\nattractive to look at.",
    "But definitely not her cup of tea.",
    "\u201cAnd if you ask me that wasn\u2019t the only murder about that time.\u201d He\nnodded and winked.",
    "\u201cI had my suspicions\u2014oh\u2014well\u2014\u201d\nMiss Marple dropped her ball of wool and the Major stooped and\npicked it up for her.",
    "\u201cTalking of murder\u201d he went on.",
    "\u201cI once came across a very curious\ncase\u2014not exactly personally.\u201d\nMiss Marple smiled encouragingly.",
    "\u201cLot of chaps talking at the club one day you know and a chap began\ntelling a story.",
    "Medical man he was.",
    "One of his cases.",
    "Young fellow came\nand knocked him up in the middle of the night.",
    "His wife had hanged herself.",
    "They hadn\u2019t got a telephone so after the chap had cut her down and done\nwhat he could he\u2019d got out his car and hared off looking for a doctor.",
    "Well\nshe wasn\u2019t dead but pretty far gone.",
    "Anyway she pulled through.",
    "Young\nfellow seemed devoted to her.",
    "Cried like a child.",
    "He\u2019d noticed that she\u2019d\nbeen odd for some time fits of depression and all that.",
    "Well that was that.",
    "Everything seemed all right.",
    "But actually about a month later the wife took\nan overdose of sleeping stuff and passed out.",
    "Sad case.\u201d\nMajor Palgrave paused and nodded his head several times.",
    "Since there\nwas obviously more to come Miss Marple waited.",
    "\u201cAnd that\u2019s that you might say.",
    "Nothing there.",
    "Neurotic woman\nnothing out of the usual.",
    "But about a year later this medical chap was\nswapping yarns with a fellow medico and the other chap told him about a\nwoman who\u2019d tried to drown herself husband got her out got a doctor they\npulled her round\u2014and then a few weeks later she gassed herself.",
    "\u201cWell a bit of a coincidence\u2014eh Same sort of story.",
    "My chap said\u2014\u2018I\nhad a case rather like that.",
    "Name of Jones or whatever the name was\u2014\nWhat was your man\u2019s name\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t remember.",
    "Robinson I think.",
    "Certainly\nnot Jones.\u2019\n\u201cWell the chaps looked at each other and said it was pretty odd.",
    "And\nthen my chap pulled out a snapshot.",
    "He showed it to the second chap.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s the fellow\u2019 he said\u2014\u2018I\u2019d gone along the next day to check up on\nthe particulars and I noticed a magnificent species of hibiscus just by the\nfront door a variety I\u2019d never seen before in this country.",
    "My camera was in\nthe car and I took a photo.",
    "Just as I snapped the shutter the husband came\nout of the front door so I got him as well.",
    "Don\u2019t think he realized it.",
    "I asked\nhim about the hibiscus but he couldn\u2019t tell me its name.\u2019 Second medico\nlooked at the snap.",
    "He said \u2018It\u2019s a bit out of focus\u2014But I could swear\u2014at\nany rate I\u2019m almost sure\u2014it\u2019s the same man.\u2019\n\u201cDon\u2019t know if they followed it up.",
    "But if so they didn\u2019t get anywhere.",
    "Expect Mr. Jones or Robinson covered his tracks too well.",
    "But queer story\nisn\u2019t it Wouldn\u2019t think things like that could happen.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes I would\u201d said Miss Marple placidly.",
    "\u201cPractically every day.\u201d\n\u201cOh come come.",
    "That\u2019s a bit fantastic.\u201d\n\u201cIf a man gets a formula that works\u2014he won\u2019t stop.",
    "He\u2019ll go on.\u201d\n\u201cBrides in the bath\u2014eh\u201d\n\u201cThat kind of thing yes.\u201d\n\u201cDoctor let me have that snap just as a curiosity\u2014\u201d\nMajor Palgrave began fumbling through an overstuffed wallet\nmurmuring to himself \u201cLots of things in here\u2014don\u2019t know why I keep all\nthese things\u2026.\u201d\nMiss Marple thought she did know.",
    "They were part of the Major\u2019s\nstockintrade.",
    "They illustrated his repertoire of stories.",
    "The story he had\n\n\fjust told or so she suspected had not been originally like that\u2014it had been\nworked up a good deal in repeated telling.",
    "The Major was still shuffling and muttering\u2014\u201cForgotten all about that\nbusiness.",
    "Goodlooking woman she was you\u2019d never suspect\u2014now where\n\u2014Ah\u2014that takes my mind back\u2014what tusks I must show you\u2014\u201d\nHe stopped\u2014sorted out a small photographic print and peered down at\nit.",
    "\u201cLike to see the picture of a murderer\u201d\nHe was about to pass it to her when his movement was suddenly\narrested.",
    "Looking more like a stuffed frog than ever Major Palgrave\nappeared to be staring fixedly over her right shoulder\u2014from whence came\nthe sound of approaching footsteps and voices.",
    "\u201cWell I\u2019m damned\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d He stuffed everything back into his\nwallet and crammed it into his pocket.",
    "His face went an even deeper shade of purplish red\u2014He exclaimed in a\nloud artificial voice\n\u201cAs I was saying\u2014I\u2019d like to have shown you those elephant tusks\u2014\nBiggest elephant I\u2019ve ever shot\u2014Ah hallo\u201d His voice took on a somewhat\nspurious hearty note.",
    "\u201cLook who\u2019s here The great quartette\u2014Flora and Fauna\u2014What luck\nhave you had today\u2014Eh\u201d\nThe approaching footsteps resolved themselves into four of the hotel\nguests whom Miss Marple already knew by sight.",
    "They consisted of two\nmarried couples and though Miss Marple was not as yet acquainted with\ntheir surnames she knew that the big man with the upstanding bush of thick\ngrey hair was addressed as \u201cGreg\u201d that the golden blonde woman his wife\nwas known as Lucky\u2014and that the other married couple the dark lean man\nand the handsome but rather weatherbeaten woman were Edward and\nEvelyn.",
    "They were botanists she understood and also interested in birds.",
    "\u201cNo luck at all\u201d said Greg\u2014\u201cAt least no luck in getting what we were\nafter.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know if you know Miss Marple Colonel and Mrs. Hillingdon\nand Greg and Lucky Dyson.\u201d\nThey greeted her pleasantly and Lucky said loudly that she\u2019d die if she\ndidn\u2019t have a drink at once or sooner.",
    "Greg hailed Tim Kendal who was sitting a little way away with his wife\nporing over account books.",
    "\u201cHi Tim.",
    "Get us some drinks.\u201d He addressed the others.",
    "\u201cPlanters\nPunch\u201d\nThey agreed.",
    "\u201cSame for you Miss Marple\u201d\nMiss Marple said Thank you but she would prefer fresh lime.",
    "\u201cFresh lime it is\u201d said Tim Kendal \u201cand five Planters Punches.\u201d\n\u201cJoin us Tim\u201d\n\u201cWish I could.",
    "But I\u2019ve got to fix up these accounts.",
    "Can\u2019t leave Molly\nto cope with everything.",
    "Steel band tonight by the way.\u201d\n\u201cGood\u201d cried Lucky.",
    "\u201cDamn it\u201d she winced \u201cI\u2019m all over thorns.",
    "Ouch Edward deliberately rammed me into a thorn bush\u201d\n\u201cLovely pink flowers\u201d said Hillingdon.",
    "\u201cAnd lovely long thorns.",
    "Sadistic brute aren\u2019t you Edward\u201d\n\u201cNot like me\u201d said Greg grinning.",
    "\u201cFull of the milk of human\nkindness.\u201d\nEvelyn Hillingdon sat down by Miss Marple and started talking to her\nin an easy pleasant way.",
    "Miss Marple put her knitting down on her lap.",
    "Slowly and with some\ndifficulty owing to rheumatism in the neck she turned her head over her\nright shoulder to look behind her.",
    "At some little distance there was the large\nbungalow occupied by the rich Mr. Rafiel.",
    "But it showed no sign of life.",
    "She replied suitably to Evelyn\u2019s remarks really how kind people were\nto her but her eyes scanned thoughtfully the faces of the two men.",
    "Edward Hillingdon looked a nice man.",
    "Quiet but with a lot of charm \u2026\nAnd Greg\u2014big boisterous happylooking.",
    "He and Lucky were Canadian\nor American she thought.",
    "She looked at Major Palgrave still acting a bonhomie a little larger than\nlife.",
    "Interesting\u2026.",
    "Two\nMISS MARPLE MAKES COMPARISONS\nI\n\nIt was very gay that evening at the Golden Palm Hotel.",
    "Seated at her little corner table Miss Marple looked round her in an\ninterested fashion.",
    "The dining room was a large room open on three sides to\nthe soft warm scented air of the West Indies.",
    "There were small table lamps\nall softly coloured.",
    "Most of the women were in evening dress light cotton\nprints out of which bronzed shoulders and arms emerged.",
    "Miss Marple\nherself had been urged by her nephew\u2019s wife Joan in the sweetest way\npossible to accept \u201ca small cheque.\u201d\n\u201cBecause Aunt Jane it will be rather hot out there and I don\u2019t expect\nyou have any very thin clothes.\u201d\nJane Marple had thanked her and had accepted the cheque.",
    "She came of\nthe age when it was natural for the old to support and finance the young but\nalso for the middleaged to look after the old.",
    "She could not however force\nherself to buy anything very thin At her age she seldom felt more than\npleasantly warm even in the hottest weather and the temperature of St.\nHonor\u00e9 was not really what is referred to as \u201ctropical heat.\u201d This evening\nshe was attired in the best traditions of the provincial gentlewoman of\nEngland\u2014grey lace.",
    "Not that she was the only elderly person present.",

    "There were middleaged couples from the\nNorth of England.",
    "There was a gay family from Caracas complete with\nchildren.",
    "The various countries of South America were well represented all\nchattering loudly in Spanish or Portuguese.",
    "There was a solid English\nbackground of two clergymen one doctor and one retired judge.",
    "There was\neven a family of Chinese.",
    "The dining room service was mainly done by\nwomen tall black girls of proud carriage dressed in crisp white but there\n\n\fwas an experienced Italian head waiter in charge and a French wine waiter\nand there was the attentive eye of Tim Kendal watching over everything\npausing here and there to have a social word with people at their tables.",
    "His\nwife seconded him ably.",
    "She was a goodlooking girl.",
    "Her hair was a\nnatural golden blonde and she had a wide generous mouth that laughed\neasily.",

    "\u201cOh what a smashing dress you\u2019ve got on tonight Mrs. Dyson.",
    "I\u2019m so\njealous I could tear it off your back.\u201d But she looked very well in her own\ndress or so Miss Marple thought a white sheath with a pale green\nembroidered silk shawl thrown over her shoulders.",
    "Lucky was fingering the\nshawl.",

    "\u201cNothing special you want is there\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cBecause you\u2019ve only\ngot to tell me\u2014and I could get it specially cooked for you.",
    "Hotel food and\nsemitropical at that isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019re used to at home I expect\u201d\nMiss Marple smiled and said that that was one of the pleasures of\ncoming abroad.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all right then.",
    "But if there is anything\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSuch as\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Tim Kendal looked a little doubtful\u2014\u201cBread and butter\npudding\u201d he hazarded.",

    "She picked up her spoon and began to eat her passion fruit sundae with\ncheerful appreciation.",
    "Then the steel band began to play.",
    "The steel bands were one of the main\nattractions of the islands.",
    "Truth to tell Miss Marple could have done very\nwell without them.",
    "She considered that they made a hideous noise\nunnecessarily loud.",
    "The pleasure that everyone else took in them was\nundeniable however and Miss Marple in the true spirit of her youth\ndecided that as they had to be she must manage somehow to learn to like\n\n\fthem.",

    "She would get up at her leisure\nmoving slowly because it was rather hot and her fingers weren\u2019t as nimble\nas they used to be.",
    "Then she would rest for ten minutes or so and she would\ntake her knitting and walk slowly along towards the hotel and decide where\nshe would settle herself.",
    "On the terrace overlooking the sea Or should she\ngo on to the bathing beach to watch the bathers and the children Usually it\n\n\fwas the latter.",

    "\u201cHe\nwas telling me about his very varied and interesting life.",
    "So many strange\nparts of the globe.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed\u201d said Dr. Graham who had been bored many times by the\nMajor\u2019s reminiscences.",
    "\u201cAnd then he spoke of his family boyhood rather and I told him a little\nabout my own nephews and nieces and he listened very sympathetically.",
    "And I showed him a snapshot I had with me of one of my nephews.",
    "Such a\ndear boy\u2014at least not exactly a boy now but always a boy to me if you\nunderstand.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so\u201d said Dr. Graham wondering how long it would be before\nthe old lady was going to come to the point.",
    "\u201cI had handed it to him and he was examining it when quite suddenly\nthose people\u2014those very nice people\u2014who collect wild flowers and\nbutterflies Colonel and Mrs. Hillingdon I think the name is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh yes The Hillingdons and the Dysons.\u201d\n\u201cYes that\u2019s right.",
    "They came suddenly along laughing and talking.",
    "They\nsat down and ordered drinks and we all talked together.",
    "Very pleasant it\nwas.",
    "But without thinking Major Palgrave must have put back my snapshot\ninto his wallet and returned it to his pocket.",
    "I wasn\u2019t paying very much\nattention at the time but I remembered afterward and I said to myself\u2014\u2018I\nmustn\u2019t forget to ask the Major to give me back my picture of Denzil.\u2019 I did\nthink of it last night while the dancing and the band was going on but I\ndidn\u2019t like to interrupt him just then because they were having such a merry\nparty together and I thought \u2018I will remember to ask him for it in the\nmorning.\u2019 Only this morning\u2014\u201d Miss Marple paused\u2014out of breath.",
    "\u201cYes yes\u201d said Dr. Graham \u201cI quite understand.",
    "And you\u2014well\nnaturally you want the snapshot back.",
    "Is that it\u201d\nMiss Marple nodded her head in eager agreement.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "That\u2019s it.",
    "You see it is the only one I have got and I haven\u2019t got\nthe negative.",
    "And I would hate to lose that snapshot because poor Denzil\ndied some five or six years ago and he was my favourite nephew.",
    "This is the\nonly picture I have to remind me of him.",
    "I wondered\u2014I hoped\u2014it is rather\ntiresome of me to ask\u2014whether you could possibly manage to get hold of it\nfor me I don\u2019t really know who else to ask you see.",
    "I don\u2019t know who\u2019ll\nattend to all his belongings and things like that.",
    "It is all so difficult.",
    "They\nwould think it such a nuisance of me.",
    "You see they don\u2019t understand.",
    "Nobody could quite understand what this snapshot means to me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course of course\u201d said Dr. Graham.",
    "\u201cI quite understand.",
    "A most\nnatural feeling on your part.",
    "Actually I am meeting the local authorities\nshortly\u2014the funeral is tomorrow\u2014and someone will be coming from the\nAdministrator\u2019s office to look over his papers and effects before\ncommunicating with the next of kin\u2014all that sort of thing\u2014If you could\ndescribe this snapshot.\u201d\n\u201cIt was just the front of a house\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cAnd someone\u2014\nDenzil I mean\u2014was just coming out of the front door.",
    "As I say it was taken\nby one of my other nephews who is very keen on flower shows\u2014and he\nwas photographing a hibiscus I think or one of those beautiful\u2014something\nlike antipasto\u2014lilies.",
    "Denzil just happened to come out of the front door at\nthat time.",
    "It wasn\u2019t a very good photograph of him\u2014just a trifle blurred\u2014\nBut I liked it and have always kept it.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Dr. Graham \u201cthat seems clear enough.",
    "I think we\u2019ll have\nno difficulty in getting back your picture for you Miss Marple.\u201d\nHe rose from his chair.",
    "Miss Marple smiled up at him.",
    "\u201cYou are very kind Dr. Graham very kind indeed.",
    "You do understand\ndon\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do of course I do\u201d said Dr. Graham shaking her warmly\nby the hand.",
    "\u201cNow don\u2019t you worry.",
    "Exercise that knee every day gently but\nnot too much and I\u2019ll send you round these tablets.",
    "Take one three times a\nday.\u201d\n\n\fFive\nMISS MARPLE MAKES A DECISION\n\nThe funeral service was said over the body of the late Major Palgrave on\nthe following day.",
    "Miss Marple attended in company with Miss Prescott.",
    "The Canon read the service\u2014after that life went on as usual.",
    "Major Palgrave\u2019s death was already only an incident a slightly\nunpleasant incident but one that was soon forgotten.",
    "Life here was\nsunshine sea and social pleasures.",
    "A grim visitor had interrupted these\nactivities casting a momentary shadow but the shadow was now gone.",
    "After all nobody had known the deceased very well.",
    "He had been rather a\ngarrulous elderly man of the clubbore type always telling you personal\nreminiscences that you had no particular desire to hear.",
    "He had had little to\nanchor himself to any particular part of the world.",
    "His wife had died many\nyears ago.",
    "He had had a lonely life and a lonely death.",
    "But it had been the\nkind of loneliness that spends itself in living amongst people and in passing\nthe time that way not unpleasantly.",
    "Major Palgrave might have been a\nlonely man he had also been quite a cheerful one.",
    "He had enjoyed himself\nin his own particular way.",
    "And now he was dead buried and nobody cared\nvery much and in another week\u2019s time nobody would even remember him\nor spare him a passing thought.",
    "The only person who could possibly be said to miss him was Miss\nMarple.",
    "Not indeed out of any personal affection but he represented a kind\nof life that she knew.",
    "As one grew older so she reflected to herself one got\nmore and more into the habit of listening listening possibly without any\ngreat interest but there had been between her and the Major the gentle give\nand take of two old people.",
    "It had had a cheerful human quality.",
    "She did\nnot actually mourn Major Palgrave but she missed him.",
    "On the afternoon of the funeral as she was sitting knitting in her\nfavourite spot Dr. Graham came and joined her.",
    "She put her needles down\nand greeted him.",
    "He said at once rather apologetically\n\n\f\u201cI am afraid I have rather disappointing news Miss Marple.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed About my\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "We haven\u2019t found that precious snapshot of yours.",
    "I\u2019m afraid that\nwill be a disappointment to you.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Yes it is.",
    "But of course it does not really matter.",
    "It was a\nsentimentality.",
    "I do realize that now.",
    "It wasn\u2019t in Major Palgrave\u2019s wallet\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Nor anywhere else among his things.",
    "There were a few letters and\nnewspaper clippings and odds and ends and a few old photographs but no\nsign of a snapshot such as you mentioned.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cWell it can\u2019t be helped \u2026 Thank you\nvery much Dr. Graham for the trouble you\u2019ve taken.\u201d\n\u201cOh it was no trouble indeed.",
    "But I know quite well from my own\nexperience how much family trifles mean to one especially as one is\ngetting older.\u201d\nThe old lady was really taking it very well he thought.",
    "Major Palgrave\nhe presumed had probably come across the snapshot when taking\nsomething out of his wallet and not even realizing how it had come there\nhad torn it up as something of no importance.",
    "But of course it was of great\nimportance to this old lady.",
    "Still she seemed quite cheerful and\nphilosophical about it.",
    "Internally however Miss Marple was far from being either cheerful or\nphilosophical.",
    "She wanted a little time in which to think things out but she\nwas also determined to use her present opportunities to the fullest effect.",
    "She engaged Dr. Graham in conversation with an eagerness which she\ndid not attempt to conceal.",
    "That kindly man putting down her flow of talk\nto the natural loneliness of an old lady exerted himself to divert her mind\nfrom the loss of the snapshot by conversing easily and pleasantly about life\nin St. Honor\u00e9 and the various interesting places perhaps Miss Marple might\nlike to visit.",
    "He hardly knew himself how the conversation drifted back to\nMajor Palgrave\u2019s decease.",
    "\u201cIt seems so sad\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cTo think of anyone dying like this\naway from home.",
    "Though I gather from what he himself told me that he\nhad no immediate family.",
    "It seems he lived by himself in London.\u201d\n\u201cHe travelled a fair amount I believe\u201d said Dr. Graham.",
    "\u201cAt any rate in\nthe winters.",
    "He didn\u2019t care for our English winters.",
    "Can\u2019t say I blame him.\u201d\n\u201cNo indeed\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cAnd perhaps he had some special\nreason like a weakness of the lungs or something which made it necessary\n\n\ffor him to winter abroad\u201d\n\u201cOh no I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cHe had high blood pressure I believe.",
    "So sad nowadays.",
    "One hears so\nmuch of it.\u201d\n\u201cHe spoke about it to you did he\u201d\n\u201cOh no.",
    "No he never mentioned it.",
    "It was somebody else who told me.\u201d\n\u201cAh really.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose\u201d went on Miss Marple \u201cthat death was to be expected under\nthose circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily\u201d said Dr. Graham.",
    "\u201cThere are methods of controlling\nblood pressure nowadays.\u201d\n\u201cHis death seemed very sudden\u2014but I suppose you weren\u2019t surprised.\u201d\n\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t particularly surprised in a man of that age.",
    "But I certainly\ndidn\u2019t expect it.",
    "Frankly he always seemed to me in very good form but I\nhadn\u2019t ever attended him professionally.",
    "I\u2019d never taken his blood pressure\nor anything like that.\u201d\n\u201cDoes one know\u2014I mean does a doctor know\u2014when a man has high\nblood pressure just by looking at him\u201d Miss Marple inquired with a kind of\ndewy innocence.",
    "\u201cNot just by looking\u201d said the doctor smiling.",
    "\u201cOne has to do a bit of\ntesting.\u201d\n\u201cOh I see.",
    "That dreadful thing when you put a rubber band round\nsomebody\u2019s arm and blow it up\u2014I dislike it so much.",
    "But my doctor said\nthat my blood pressure was really very good for my age.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good hearing\u201d said Dr. Graham.",
    "\u201cOf course the Major was rather fond of Planters Punch\u201d said Miss\nMarple thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Not the best thing with blood pressure\u2014alcohol.\u201d\n\u201cOne takes tablets doesn\u2019t one or so I have heard\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "There are several on the market.",
    "There was a bottle of one of them\nin his room\u2014Serenite.\u201d\n\u201cHow wonderful science is nowadays\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cDoctors can\ndo so much can\u2019t they\u201d\n\u201cWe all have one great competitor\u201d said Dr. Graham.",
    "\u201cNature you\nknow.",
    "And some of the good oldfashioned home remedies come back from\ntime to time.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cLike putting cobwebs on a cut\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cWe always used to\ndo that when I was a child.\u201d\n\u201cVery sensible\u201d said Dr. Graham.",
    "\u201cAnd a linseed poultice on the chest and rubbing in camphorated oil for\na bad cough.\u201d\n\u201cI see you know it all\u201d said Dr. Graham laughing.",
    "He got up.",
    "\u201cHow\u2019s\nthe knee Not been too troublesome\u201d\n\u201cNo it seems much much better.\u201d\n\u201cWell we won\u2019t say whether that\u2019s Nature or my pills\u201d said Dr.\nGraham.",
    "\u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t have been of more help to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have been most kind\u2014I am really ashamed of taking up your\ntime\u2014Did you say that there were no photographs in the Major\u2019s wallet\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u2014a very old one of the Major himself as quite a young man on\na polo pony\u2014and one of a dead tiger\u2014He was standing with his foot on it.",
    "Snaps of that sort\u2014memories of his younger days\u2014But I looked very\ncarefully I assure you and the one you describe of your nephew was\ndefinitely not there\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure you looked carefully\u2014I didn\u2019t mean that\u2014I was just\ninterested\u2014We all tend to keep such very odd things\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTreasures from the past\u201d said the doctor smiling.",
    "He said goodbye and departed.",
    "Miss Marple remained looking thoughtfully at the palm trees and the\nsea.",
    "She did not pick up her knitting again for some minutes.",
    "She had a fact\nnow.",
    "She had to think about that fact and what it meant.",
    "The snapshot that\nthe Major had brought out of his wallet and replaced so hurriedly was not\nthere after he died.",
    "It was not the sort of thing the Major would throw away.",
    "He had replaced it in his wallet and it ought to have been in his wallet after\nhis death.",
    "Money might have been stolen but no one would want to steal a\nsnapshot.",
    "Unless that is they had a special reason for so doing\u2026.",
    "Miss Marple\u2019s face was grave.",
    "She had to take a decision.",
    "Was she or\nwas she not going to allow Major Palgrave to remain quietly in his grave\nMight it not be better to do just that She quoted under her breath.",
    "\u201cDuncan\nis dead.",
    "After Life\u2019s fitful fever he sleeps well\u201d Nothing could hurt Major\nPalgrave now.",
    "He had gone where danger could not touch him.",
    "Was it just a\ncoincidence that he should have died on that particular night Or was it just\npossibly not a coincidence Doctors accepted the deaths of elderly men so\neasily.",
    "Especially since in his room there had been a bottle of the tablets that\n\n\fpeople with high blood pressure had to take every day of their lives.",
    "But if\nsomeone had taken the snapshot from the Major\u2019s wallet that same person\ncould have put that bottle of tablets in the Major\u2019s room.",
    "She herself never\nremembered seeing the Major take tablets he had never spoken about his\nblood pressure to her.",
    "The only thing he had ever said about his health was\nthe admission\u2014\u201cNot as young as I was.\u201d He had been occasionally a little\nshort of breath a trifle asthmatic nothing else.",
    "But someone had mentioned\nthat Major Palgrave had high blood pressure\u2014Molly Miss Prescott She\ncouldn\u2019t remember.",
    "Miss Marple sighed then admonished herself in words though she did\nnot speak those words aloud.",
    "\u201cNow Jane what are you suggesting or thinking Are you perhaps just\nmaking the whole thing up Have you really got anything to build on\u201d\nShe went over step by step as nearly as she could the conversation\nbetween herself and the Major on the subject of murder and murderers.",
    "\u201cOh dear\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cEven if\u2014really I don\u2019t see how I can do\nanything about it\u2014\u201d\nBut she knew that she meant to try.",
    "Six\nIN THE SMALL HOURS\nI\n\nMiss Marple woke early.",
    "Like many old people she slept lightly and had\nperiods of wakefulness which she used for the planning of some action or\nactions to be carried out on the next or following days.",
    "Usually of course\nthese were of a wholly private or domestic nature of little interest to\nanybody but herself.",
    "But this morning Miss Marple lay thinking soberly and\nconstructively of murder and what if her suspicions were correct she\ncould do about it.",
    "It wasn\u2019t going to be easy.",
    "She had one weapon and one\nweapon only and that was conversation.",
    "Old ladies were given to a good deal of rambling conversation.",
    "People\nwere bored by this but certainly did not suspect them of ulterior motives.",
    "It\nwould not be a case of asking direct questions.",
    "Indeed she would have\nfound it difficult to know what questions to ask It would be a question of\nfinding out a little more about certain people.",
    "She reviewed these certain\npeople in her mind.",
    "She could find out possibly a little more about Major Palgrave but\nwould that really help her She doubted if it would.",
    "If Major Palgrave had\nbeen killed it was not because of secrets in his life or to inherit his money or\nfor revenge upon him.",
    "In fact although he was the victim it was one of\nthose rare cases where a greater knowledge of the victim does not help you\nor lead you in any way to his murderer.",
    "The point it seemed to her and the\nsole point was that Major Palgrave talked too much\nShe had learnt one rather interesting fact from Dr. Graham.",
    "He had had\nin his wallet various photographs one of himself in company with a polo\npony one of a dead tiger also one or two other shots of the same nature.",
    "Now why did Major Palgrave carry these about with him Obviously\nthought Miss Marple with long experience of old admirals brigadiergenerals and mere majors behind her because he had certain stories which\n\n\fhe enjoyed telling to people.",
    "Starting off with \u201cCurious thing happened\nonce when I was out tiger shooting in India\u2026.\u201d Or a reminiscence of\nhimself and a polo pony.",
    "Therefore this story about a suspected murderer\nwould in due course be illustrated by the production of the snapshot from\nhis wallet.",
    "He had been following that pattern in his conversation with her.",
    "The\nsubject of murder having come up and to focus interest on his story he had\ndone what he no doubt usually did produced his snapshot and said\nsomething in the nature of \u201cWouldn\u2019t think this chap was a murderer would\nyou\u201d\nThe point was that it had been a habit of his.",
    "This murderer story was\none of his regular repertoire.",
    "If any reference to murder came up then away\nwent the Major full steam ahead.",
    "In that case reflected Miss Marple he might already have told his story\nto someone else here.",
    "Or to more than one person\u2014If that were so then she\nherself might learn from that person what the further details of the story had\nbeen possibly what the person in the snapshot had looked like.",
    "She nodded her head in satisfaction\u2014That would be a beginning.",
    "And of course there were the people she called in her mind the \u201cFour\nSuspects.\u201d Though really since Major Palgrave had been talking about a\nman\u2014there were only two.",
    "Colonel Hillingdon or Mr. Dyson very\nunlikelylooking murderers but then murderers so often were unlikely.",
    "Could there have been anyone else She had seen no one when she turned\nher head to look.",
    "There was the bungalow of course.",
    "Mr. Rafiel\u2019s bungalow.",
    "Could somebody have come out of the bungalow and gone in again before\nshe had had time to turn her head If so it could only have been the valetattendant.",
    "What was his name Oh yes Jackson.",
    "Could it have been\nJackson who had come out of the door That would have been the same\npose as the photograph.",
    "A man coming out of a door.",
    "Recognition might\nhave struck suddenly.",
    "Up till then Major Palgrave would not have looked at\nArthur Jackson valetattendant with any interest.",
    "His roving and curious\neye was essentially a snobbish eye\u2014Arthur Jackson was not a pukka sahib\n\u2014Major Palgrave would not have glanced at him twice.",
    "Until perhaps he had had the snapshot in his hand and had looked over\nMiss Marple\u2019s right shoulder and had seen a man coming out of a door \u2026\nMiss Marple turned over on her pillow\u2014Programme for tomorrow\u2014or\nrather for today\u2014Further investigation of the Hillingdons the Dysons and\n\n\fArthur Jackson valetattendant.",
    "II\nDr. Graham also woke early.",
    "Usually he turned over and went to sleep\nagain.",
    "But today he was uneasy and sleep failed to come.",
    "This anxiety that\nmade it so difficult to go to sleep again was a thing he had not suffered from\nfor a long time.",
    "What was causing this anxiety Really he couldn\u2019t make it\nout.",
    "He lay there thinking it over.",
    "Something to do with\u2014something to do\nwith\u2014yes Major Palgrave.",
    "Major Palgrave\u2019s death He didn\u2019t see though\nwhat there could be to make him uneasy there.",
    "Was it something that that\ntwittery old lady had said Bad luck for her about her snapshot.",
    "She\u2019d taken\nit very well.",
    "But now what was it she had said what chance word of hers\nhad it been that had given him this funny feeling of uneasiness After all\nthere was nothing odd about the Major\u2019s death.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "At least he\nsupposed there was nothing at all.",
    "It was quite clear that in the Major\u2019s state of health\u2014a faint check came\nin his thought process.",
    "Did he really know much about Major Palgrave\u2019s\nstate of health Everybody said that he\u2019d suffered from high blood pressure.",
    "But he himself had never had any conversation with the Major about it.",
    "But\nthen he\u2019d never had much conversation with Major Palgrave anyway.",
    "Palgrave was an old bore and he avoided old bores.",
    "Why on earth should he\nhave this idea that perhaps everything mightn\u2019t be all right Was it that old\nwoman But after all she hadn\u2019t said anything.",
    "Anyway it was none of his\nbusiness.",
    "The local authorities were quite satisfied.",
    "There had been that\nbottle of Serenite tablets and the old boy had apparently talked to people\nabout his blood pressure quite freely.",
    "Dr. Graham turned over in bed and soon went to sleep again.",
    "III\nOutside the hotel grounds in one of a row of shanty cabins beside a creek\nthe girl Victoria Johnson rolled over and sat up in bed.",
    "The St. Honor\u00e9 girl\nwas a magnificent creature with a torso of black marble such as a sculptor\nwould have enjoyed.",

    "\u201cI see.",
    "You think maybe there\u2019s something funny about old Palgrave\u2019s\ndeath You\u2019re no longer sure that it was just natural causes Who certified\nthe death Robertson I suppose.",
    "He didn\u2019t have any doubts did he\u201d\n\u201cNo but I think he may have been influenced in giving the certificate\nby the fact of the Serenite tablets in the bathroom.",
    "He asked me if Palgrave\nhad mentioned that he suffered from hypertension and I said No I\u2019d never\nhad any medical conversation with him myself but apparently he had\ntalked about it to other people in the hotel.",

    "If it had been my business\nto give the certificate I\u2019d have given it without a second thought.",
    "The\nappearances are quite consistent with his having died from that cause.",

    "They magnify\nsome small detail and work the whole thing up.\u201d\n\u201cYes I know\u201d said Dr. Graham unhappily.",
    "\u201cI know that.",
    "I\u2019ve said to\nmyself that it may be so that it probably is so.",
    "But I can\u2019t quite convince\nmyself.",
    "She was so very clear and detailed in her statement.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole thing seems wildly improbable to me\u201d said Daventry.",
    "\u201cSome old lady tells a story about a snapshot that ought not to be there\u2014no\nI\u2019m getting mixed myself\u2014I mean the other way about don\u2019t I\u2014but the\nonly thing you\u2019ve really got to go on is that a chambermaid says that a\nbottle of pills which the authorities had relied on for evidence wasn\u2019t in the\nMajor\u2019s room the day before his death.",
    "But there are a hundred explanations\nfor that.",
    "He might always have carried those pills about in his pocket.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible I suppose yes.\u201d\n\u201cOr the chambermaid may have made a mistake and she simply hadn\u2019t\nnoticed them before\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s possible too.\u201d\n\u201cWell then.\u201d\nGraham said slowly\n\u201cThe girl was very positive.\u201d\n\u201cWell the St. Honor\u00e9 people are very excitable.",
    "You know.",
    "Emotional.",
    "Work themselves up easily.",
    "Are you thinking that she knows\u2014a little more\nthan she has said\u201d\n\u201cI think it might be so\u201d said Dr. Graham slowly.",

    "Then to make it appear a natural death a bottle of the tablets\nprescribed to relieve blood pressure was put in his room.",
    "And the rumour\nwas put about that he suffered from high blood pressure.\u201d\n\u201cWho put the rumour about\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to find out\u2014with no success\u2014It\u2019s been too cleverly done.",
    "A\nsays \u2018I think B told me\u2019\u2014B asked says \u2018No I didn\u2019t say so but I do\nremember C mentioning it one day.\u2019 C says \u2018Several people talked about it\n\u2014one of them I think was A.\u2019 And there we are back again.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone was clever\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "As soon as the death was discovered everybody seemed to be\ntalking about the Major\u2019s high blood pressure and repeating round what\nother people had said.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been simpler just to poison him and let it go at that\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "That might have meant an inquiry\u2014possibly an autopsy\u2014This\nway a doctor would accept the death and give a certificate\u2014as he did.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do Go to the CID Suggest they dig the chap\nup It\u2019d make a lot of stink\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt could be kept quite quiet.\u201d\n\u201cCould it In St. Honor\u00e9 Think again The grapevine would be on to it\nbefore it had happened.",
    "All the same\u201d Daventry sighed\u2014\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll\nhave to do something.",

    "Yes.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I can make out\u201d said Miss Marple \u201cand from what I have\nheard and read a man who does a wicked thing like this and gets away with\nit the first time is alas encouraged.",
    "He thinks it\u2019s easy he thinks he\u2019s\nclever.",

    "She got up went into the bathroom and peered cautiously through the\nwindow.",
    "Arthur Jackson was standing by the door of the bungalow next door.",
    "Mr.\nRafiel\u2019s bungalow.",
    "She saw him give a rapid glance round and then slip\nquickly inside.",
    "Interesting thought Miss Marple.",
    "Why did he have to look\nround in that furtive manner Nothing in the world could have been more\nnatural than his going into Mr. Rafiel\u2019s bungalow since he himself had a\nroom at the back of it.",
    "He was always going in and out of it on some errand\nor other.",
    "So why that quick guilty glance round \u201cOnly one reason\u201d said\nMiss Marple answering her own question \u201che wanted to be sure that\nnobody was observing him enter at this particular moment because of\nsomething he was going to do in there.\u201d\nEverybody of course was on the beach at this moment except those\nwho had gone for expeditions.",

    "Well she must do her best\nto do exactly that.",
    "Sitting down on her bed Miss Marple removed her neat sandal shoes\nand replaced them with a pair of plimsolls.",
    "Then she shook her head\nremoved the plimsolls burrowed in her suitcase and took out a pair of shoes\nthe heel of one of which she had recently caught on a hook by the door.",
    "It\nwas now in a slightly precarious state and Miss Marple adroitly rendered it\neven more precarious by attention with a nail file.",
    "Then she emerged with\ndue precaution from her door walking in stockinged feet.",
    "With all the care\nof a Big Game Hunter approaching upwind of a herd of antelope Miss\nMarple gently circumnavigated Mr. Rafiel\u2019s bungalow.",
    "Cautiously she\nmanoeuvred her way around the corner of the house.",
    "She put on one of the\n\n\fshoes she was carrying gave a final wrench to the heel of the other sank\ngently to her knees and lay prone under the window.",
    "If Jackson heard\nanything if he came to the window to look out an old lady would have had\na fall owing to the heel coming off her shoe.",

    "Very very gently Miss Marple raised her head.",
    "The windows of the\nbungalow were low.",
    "Shielding herself slightly with a festoon of creeper she\npeered inside\u2026.",

    "Jackson was\nsnooping.",
    "Whether he was looking for something in particular or whether\nhe was just indulging his natural instincts she had no means of judging.",

    "Her problem was now to withdraw.",
    "Very carefully she dropped down\nagain and crept along the flowerbed until she was clear of the window.",
    "She\nreturned to her bungalow and carefully put away the shoe and the heel that\nshe had detached from it.",
    "She looked at them with affection.",
    "A good device\nwhich she could use on another day if necessary.",
    "She resumed her own\nsandal shoes and went thoughtfully down to the beach again.",
    "Choosing a moment when Esther Walters was in the water Miss Marple\nmoved into the chair Esther had vacated.",
    "Greg and Lucky were laughing and talking with Se\u00f1ora de Caspearo\nand making a good deal of noise.",

    "\u201cWell\u2014yes as a matter of fact it\nwas.",
    "He told me a lot of stories like that.",
    "Of course most of it must have\nbeen before his time but he seemed to know all about it.\u201d\n\u201cMajor Palgrave was under the impression that he knew a lot about\neverything\u201d said Miss Marple.",

    "Tim was back looking after Molly and Miss Marple had arranged that\nshe should relieve him there during the time that dinner was served and he\nwas needed in the dining room.",
    "He had assured her that Mrs. Dyson was\nquite willing to take that on or even Mrs. Hillingdon but Miss Marple said\nfirmly that they were both young women who liked enjoying themselves\nand that she herself preferred a light meal early and so that would suit\neverybody.",

    "But afterwards she was forced to admit there was nothing but\ndifficulty.",
    "Everything pointed in too many different directions at once.",
    "Once\nadmit that you didn\u2019t believe a word that anybody had said to you that\nnobody could be trusted and that many of the persons with whom she had\nconversed here had regrettable resemblances to certain persons at St. Mary\nMead and where did that lead you\n\n\fHer mind was increasingly focused on the victim.",

    "Everything pointed to it.",

    "Yes yes I did have a copy of my will along.\u201d\n\u201cYou told me\u201d said Miss Marple \u201cyou told me\u2014as Humpty Dumpty\nsaid\u2014very loud and clear that you had not left anything to Esther Walters\nin your will.",
    "You had impressed that fact upon her and also upon Jackson.",
    "It was true in Jackson\u2019s case I should imagine.",
    "You have not left him\nanything but you had left Esther Walters money though you weren\u2019t going\nto let her have any inkling of the fact.",
    "Isn\u2019t that right\u201d\n\u201cYes it\u2019s quite right but I don\u2019t know how you knew.\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s the way you insisted on the point\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cI have\na certain experience of the way people tell lies.\u201d\n\u201cI give in\u201d said Mr. Rafiel.",
    "\u201cAll right.",
    "I left Esther \u00a350000.",
    "It would\ncome as a nice surprise to her when I died.",
    "I suppose that knowing this\nTim Kendal decided to exterminate his present wife with a nice dose of\nsomething or other and marry \u00a350000 and Esther Walters.",
    "Possibly to\ndispose of her also in good time.",
    "But how did he know she was going to\nhave \u00a350000\u201d\n\u201cJackson told him of course\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cThey were very\nfriendly those two.",
    "Tim Kendal was nice to Jackson and quite I should\nimagine without ulterior motive.",
    "But amongst the bits of gossip that\nJackson let slip I think Jackson told him that unbeknownst to herself Esther\nWalters was going to inherit a fat lot of money and he may have said that\nhe himself hoped to induce Esther Walters to marry him though he hadn\u2019t\nhad much success so far in taking her fancy.",
    "Yes I think that\u2019s how it\nhappened.\u201d\n\u201cThe things you imagine always seem perfectly plausible\u201d said Mr.\nRafiel.",
    "\u201cBut I was stupid\u201d said Miss Marple \u201cvery stupid.",
    "Everything fitted in\nreally you see.",
    "Tim Kendal was a very clever man as well as being a very\nwicked one.",
    "He was particularly good at putting about rumours.",
    "Half the\nthings I\u2019ve been told here came from him originally I imagine.",
    "There were\nstories going around about Molly wanting to marry an undesirable young\nman but I rather fancy that the undesirable young man was actually Tim\nKendal himself though that wasn\u2019t the name he was using then.",
    "Her people\nhad heard something perhaps that his background was fishy.",
    "So he put on a\nhigh indignation act refused to be taken by Molly to be \u2018shown off\u2019 to her\npeople and then he brewed up a little scheme with her which they both\nthought great fun.",
    "She pretended to sulk and pine for him.",
    "Then a Mr. Tim\n\n\fKendal turned up primed with the names of various old friends of Molly\u2019s\npeople and they welcomed him with open arms as being the sort of young\nman who would put the former delinquent one out of Molly\u2019s head.",
    "I am\nafraid Molly and he must have laughed over it a good deal.",
    "Anyway he\nmarried her and with her money he bought out the people who ran this\nplace and they came out here.",
    "I should imagine that he ran through her\nmoney at a pretty fair rate.",
    "Then he came across Esther Walters and he saw\na nice prospect of more money.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he bump me off\u201d said Mr. Rafiel.",
    "Miss Marple coughed.",
    "\u201cI expect he wanted to be fairly sure of Mrs. Walters first.",
    "Besides\u2014I\nmean \u2026\u201d She stopped a little confused.",
    "\u201cBesides he realized he wouldn\u2019t have to wait long\u201d said Mr. Rafiel\n\u201cand it would clearly be better for me to die a natural death.",
    "Being so rich.",
    "Deaths of millionaires are scrutinized rather carefully aren\u2019t they unlike\nmere wives\u201d\n\u201cYes you\u2019re quite right.",
    "Such a lot of lies as he told\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cLook at the lies he got Molly herself to believe\u2014putting that book on\nmental disorders in her way.",
    "Giving her drugs which would give her dreams\nand hallucinations.",
    "You know your Jackson was rather clever over that.",
    "I\nthink he recognized certain of Molly\u2019s symptoms as being the result of\ndrugs.",
    "And he came into the bungalow that day to potter about a bit in the\nbathroom.",
    "That face cream he examined.",
    "He might have got some idea from\nthe old tales of witches rubbing themselves with ointments that had\nbelladonna in them.",
    "Belladonna in face cream could have produced just that\nresult.",
    "Molly would have blackouts.",
    "Times she couldn\u2019t account for dreams\nof flying through the air.",
    "No wonder she got frightened about herself.",
    "She\nhad all the signs of mental illness Jackson was on the right track.",
    "Maybe he\ngot the idea from Major Palgrave\u2019s stories about the use of datura by Indian\nwomen on their husbands.\u201d\n\u201cMajor Palgrave\u201d said Mr. Rafiel.",
    "\u201cReally that man\u201d\n\u201cHe brought about his own murder\u201d said Miss Marple \u201cand that poor\ngirl Victoria\u2019s murder and he nearly brought about Molly\u2019s murder.",
    "But he\nrecognized a murderer all right.\u201d\n\u201cWhat made you suddenly remember about his glass eye\u201d asked Mr.\nRafiel curiously.",
    "\u201cSomething that Se\u00f1ora de Caspearo said.",
    "She talked some nonsense\nabout his being ugly and having the Evil Eye and I said it was only a glass\neye and he couldn\u2019t help that poor man and she said his eyes looked\ndifferent ways they were crosseyes\u2014which of course they were.",
    "And she\nsaid it brought bad luck.",
    "I knew\u2014I knew that I had heard something that\nday that was important.",
    "Last night just after Lucky\u2019s death it came to me\nwhat it was And then I realized there was no time to waste\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHow did Tim Kendal come to kill the wrong woman\u201d\n\u201cSheer chance.",
    "I think his plan was this Having convinced everybody\n\u2014and that included Molly herself\u2014that she was mentally unbalanced and\nafter giving her a sizeable dose of the drug he was using he told her that\nbetween them they were going to clear up all these murder puzzles.",
    "But she\nhad got to help him.",
    "After everyone was asleep they would go separately\nand meet at an agreed spot by the creek.",
    "\u201cHe said he had a very good idea who the murderer was and they\nwould trap him.",
    "Molly went off obediently\u2014but she was confused and\nstupefied with the drug she had been given and it slowed her up.",
    "Tim\narrived there first and saw what he thought was Molly.",
    "Golden hair and pale\ngreen shawl.",
    "He came up behind her put his hand over her mouth and\nforced her down into the water and held her there.\u201d\n\u201cNice fellow But wouldn\u2019t it have been easier just to give her an\noverdose of narcotic\u201d\n\u201cMuch easier of course.",
    "But that might have given rise to suspicion.",
    "All\nnarcotics and sedatives have been very carefully removed from Molly\u2019s\nreach remember.",
    "And if she had got hold of a fresh supply who more\nlikely to have supplied it than her husband But if in a fit of despair she\nwent out and drowned herself whilst her innocent husband slept the whole\nthing would be a romantic tragedy and no one would be likely to suggest\nthat she had been drowned deliberately.",
    "Besides\u201d added Miss Marple\n\u201cmurderers always find it difficult to keep things simple.",
    "They can\u2019t keep\nthemselves from elaborating.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem convinced you know all there is to be known about\nmurderers So you believe Tim didn\u2019t know he had killed the wrong\nwoman\u201d\nMiss Marple shook her head.",
    "\u201cHe didn\u2019t even look at her face just hurried off as quickly as he could\nlet an hour elapse then started to organize a search for her playing the part\n\n\fof a distracted husband.\u201d\n\u201cBut what the devil was Lucky doing hanging about the creek in the\nmiddle of the night\u201d\nMiss Marple gave an embarrassed little cough.",
    "\u201cIt is possible I think that she was\u2014er\u2014waiting to meet someone.\u201d\n\u201cEdward Hillingdon\u201d\n\u201cOh no\u201d said Miss Marple.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all over I wondered whether\u2014just\npossibly\u2014she might have been waiting for Jackson.\u201d\n\u201cWaiting for Jackson\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed her\u2014look at him once or twice\u201d murmured Miss Marple\naverting her eyes.",
    "Mr. Rafiel whistled.",
    "\u201cMy Tom Cat Jackson I wouldn\u2019t put it past him Tim must have had a\nshock later when he found he\u2019d killed the wrong woman.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed.",
    "He must have felt quite desperate.",
    "Here was Molly alive\nand wandering about.",
    "And the story he\u2019d circulated so carefully about her\nmental condition wouldn\u2019t stand up for a moment once she got into the\nhands of competent mental specialists.",
    "And once she told her damning story\nof his having asked her to meet him at the creek where would Tim Kendal\nbe He\u2019d only one hope\u2014to finish off Molly as quickly as possible.",
    "Then\nthere was a very good chance that everyone would believe that Molly in a\nfit of mania had drowned Lucky and had then horrified by what she had\ndone taken her own life.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it was then\u201d said Mr. Rafiel \u201cthat you decided to play Nemesis\neh\u201d\nHe leaned back suddenly and roared with laughter.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a damned good\njoke\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIf you knew what you looked like that night with that fluffy\npink wool all round your head standing there and saying you were\nNemesis I\u2019ll never forget it\u201d\n\n\fEpilogue\n\nThe time had come and Miss Marple was waiting at the airport for her\nplane.",
    "Quite a lot of people had come to see her off.",
    "The Hillingdons had\nleft already.",
    "Gregory Dyson had flown to one of the other islands and the\nrumour had come that he was devoting himself to an Argentinian widow.",
    "Se\u00f1ora de Caspearo had returned to South America.",
    "Molly had come to see Miss Marple off.",
    "She was pale and thin but she\nhad weathered the shock of her discovery bravely and with the help of one\nof Mr. Rafiel\u2019s nominees whom he had wired for to England she was\ncarrying on with the running of the hotel.",
    "\u201cDo you good to be busy\u201d Mr. Rafiel observed.",
    "\u201cKeep you from\nthinking.",
    "Got a good thing here.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think the murders\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPeople love murders when they\u2019re all cleared up\u201d Mr. Rafiel had\nassured her.",
    "\u201cYou carry on girl and keep your heart up.",
    "Don\u2019t distrust all\nmen because you\u2019ve met one bad lot.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like Miss Marple\u201d Molly had said \u201cshe\u2019s always telling me\nMr.",
    "Right will come along one day.\u201d\nMr. Rafiel grinned at this sentiment.",
    "So Molly was there and the two\nPrescotts and Mr. Rafiel of course and Esther\u2014an Esther who looked\nolder and sadder and to whom Mr. Rafiel was quite often unexpectedly\nkind.",
    "Jackson also was very much to the fore pretending to be looking after\nMiss Marple\u2019s baggage.",
    "He was all smiles these days and let it be known\nthat he had come into money.",
    "There was a hum in the sky.",
    "The plane was arriving.",
    "Things were\nsomewhat informal here.",
    "There was no \u201ctaking your place by Channel 8\u201d or\nChannel 9.",
    "You just walked out from the little flowercovered pavilion on to\nthe tarmac.",
    "\u201cGoodbye darling Miss Marple.\u201d Molly kissed her.",
    "\u201cGoodbye.",
    "Do try and come and visit us.\u201d Miss Prescott shook her\nwarmly by the hand.",
    "\u201cIt has been a great pleasure to know you\u201d said the Canon.",
    "\u201cI second\nmy sister\u2019s invitation most warmly.\u201d\n\u201cAll the best Madam\u201d said Jackson \u201cand remember any time you want\nany massage free just you send me a line and we\u2019ll make an appointment.\u201d\nOnly Esther Walters turned slightly away when the time came for\ngoodbyes.",
    "Miss Marple did not force one upon her.",
    "Mr. Rafiel came last.",
    "He\ntook her hand.",
    "\u201cAve Caesar nos morituri te salutamus\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid\u201d said Miss Marple \u201cI don\u2019t know very much Latin.\u201d\n\u201cBut you understand that\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d She said no more.",
    "She knew quite well what he was telling her.",
    "\u201cIt has been a great pleasure to know you\u201d she said.",
    "Then she walked across the tarmac and got into the plane."
