    "There\n\nis as I have said a devil amongst us.",

    "Oh I agree.",
    "Wife murder is perfectly possiblealmost natural lets say\n\nBut not this particular kind I can believe in Rogers killing his wife\n\nbecause he was scared of her breaking down and giving him away or because\n\nhed taken a dislike to her or because he wanted to link up with some nice\n\nlittle bit rather less long in the tooth.",
    "But I cant see him as the\n\nlunatic Mr. Owen dealing out crazy justice and starting on his own wife for\n\na crime they both committed.",
    "Mr. Justice Wargrave said\n\nYou are assuming heresay to be evidence.",
    "We do not know that Rogers and\n\nhis wife conspired to murder their employer.",

    "No eiceptions\n\nallowed.",
    "We all qualify.",
    "Mr. Justice Wargrave said\n\nMy point is that there can be no exceptions allowed on the score of\n\ncharacter position or probability.",
    "What we must now examine is the\n\npossibility of eliminating one or more persons on the facts.",
    "To put it\n\nsimply is there among us one or more persons who could not possibly have\n\nadministered either Cyanide to Anthony Marston or an overdose of sleeping\n\ndraught to Mrs. Rogers and who had no opportunity of striking the blow\n\nthat killed General Macarthur Blores rather heavy face lit up.",

    "He paused then went on.",
    "Now take the woman Rogers.",
    "The people who stand out there are her husband\n\nand the doctor.",
    "Either of them could have done it as easy as winking\n\nArmstrong sprang to his feet.",
    "He was trembling.",
    "I protest This is absolutely uncalled for I swear that the dose I gave\n\nthe woman was perfectly\n\fDr. Armstrong.",
    "The small sour voice was compelling.",
    "The doctor stopped with a jerk in the\n\nmiddle of his sentence.",
    "The small cold voice went on.",
    "Your indignation is very natural.",
    "Nevertheless you must admit that the\n\nfacts have got to be faced.",
    "Either you or Rogers could have administered\n\na fatal dose with the greatest ease.",
    "Let us now consider the position of\n\nthe other people present.",
    "What chance had 1 had Inspector Blore had Miss\n\nBrent had Miss Claythorne had Mr. Lombard of administering poison Can\n\nany one of us be completely and entirely eliminated He paused.",
    "I think\n\nnot.",

    "Mr. Justice Wargrave waited a minute then he said\n\nAs far as my memory serves me the facts were thesewill any one please\n\ncorrect me if I make a misstatement Mrs. Rogers was lifted onto the sofa\n\nby Anthony Marston and Mr. Lombard and Dr. Armstrong went to her.",
    "He sent\n\nRogers for brandy.",
    "There was then a question raised as to where the voice\n\nwe had just heard had come from.",
    "We all went into the next room with the\n\nexception of Miss Brent who remained in this roomalone with the\n\nunconscious woman.",
    "A spot of colour came into Emily Brents cheeks.",
    "She stopped knitting.",
    "She\n\nsaid This is outrageous\n\fThe remorseless small voice went on.",

    "Emily Brent said\n\nIs common humanity a criminal offence\n\nMr. Justice Wargrave said\n\nI am only establishing facts.",
    "Rogers then entered the room with the brandy\n\nwhich of course he could quite well have doctored before entering the\n\nroom.",
    "The brandy was administered to the woman and shortly afterwards her\n\nhusband and Dr. Armstrong assisted her up to bed where Dr. Armstrong gave\n\nher a sedative.",
    "Blore said\n\nThats what happened.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "And that lets out the judge Mr.\n\nLombard myself and Miss Claythorne.",
    "His voice was loud and jubilant.",
    "Mr. Justice Wargrave bringing a cold eye\n\nto bear upon him murmured\n\nAh but does it We must take into account every possible eventuality.",
    "Blore stared.",
    "He said\n\nI dont get you.",

    "The sedative that the\n\ndoctor has given her begins to take effect.",
    "She is vaguely sleepy and\n\nacquiescent.",
    "Supposing that at that moment there is a tap on the door and\n\nsome one enters bringing her shall we say a tablet or a draught with\n\nthe message that the doctor says youre to take this.",

    "Emily Brent said\n\nSurely doctor the woman would have been fast asleep by then under the\n\ninfluence of the drug you had administered\n\nIn all likelihood yes.",
    "But it is not a certainty.",
    "Until you have pre\n\nscribed for a patient more than once you cannot tell their reaction to\n\ndifferent drugs.",
    "There is sometimes a considerable period before a\n\nsedative takes effect.",
    "It depends on the personal idiosyncrasy of the\n\npatient towards that particular drug.",
    "Lombard said\n\nOf course you would say that doctor.",
    "Suits your bookeh\n\nAgain Armstrongs face darkened with anger.",
    "But again that passionless cold little voice stopped the words on his lips.",
    "No good result can come from recrimination.",
    "Facts are what we have to deal\n\nwith.",
    "It is established I think that there is a possibility of such a\n\nthing as I have outlined occurring.",
    "I agree that its probability value is\n\nnot high though there again it depends on who that person might have\n\nbeen.",
    "The appearance of Miss Brent or of Miss Claythorne on such an errand\n\nwould have occasioned no surprise in the patients mind.",
    "I agree that the\n\nappearance of myself or of Mr. Blore or of Mr. Lombard could have been\n\nto say the least of it unusual but I still think the visit would have\n\nbeen received without the awakening of any real suspicion.",

    "I spent the morning sitting on the terrace and meditating on the\n\nsingular position in which we all find ourselves.",
    "I sat on that chair on the terrace for the whole morning until the gong\n\nwent but there were I should imagine several periods during the morning\n\nwhen I was quite unobserved and during which it would have been possible\n\nfor me to walk down to the sea kill the General and return to my chair.",
    "There is only my word for the fact that I never left the terrace.",
    "In the\n\ncircumstances that is not enough.",
    "There must be proof.",
    "Blore said\n\nI was with Mr. Lombard and Dr. Armstrong all the morning.",
    "Theyll bear me\n\nout.",
    "Dr. Armstrong said\n\nYou went to the house for a rope.",
    "Blore said\n\nOf course I did.",
    "Went straight there and straight back.",
    "You know I did.",
    "Armstrong said\n\nYou were a long time.",

    "Wanted to find the best spot.",

    "He said\n\nThats right.",
    "Not long enough to do a murder I assure you.",
    "The judge said\n\nDid either of you two glance at your watches\n\nWell no.",

    "The judge said evenly\n\nA minute or two is a vague expression.",
    "He turned his head to the upright figure with the knitting lying on her\n\nlap.",
    "Miss Brent\n\nEmily Brent said\n\nI took a walk with Miss Claythorne up to the top of the island.",
    "Afterwards\n\nI sat on the terrace in the sun.",
    "The judge said\n\nI dont think I noticed you there.",
    "No I was round the corner of the house to the east.",
    "It was out of the\n\nwind there.",
    "And you sat there till lunch time\n\nYes.",
    "Miss Claythorne\n\n    Vera answered readily and clearly.",
    "I was with Miss Brent early this morning.",
    "After that I wandered about a\n\nbit.",
    "Then I went down and talked to General Macarthur.",
    "Mr. Justice Wargrave interrupted.",
    "He said\n\n    What time was that\n\n    Vera for the first time was vague.",
    "She said\n\n    I dont know.",
    "About an hour before lunch I thinkor it might have been\n\n    less.",

    "Hehe was very queer.",
    "She shivered.",
    "In what way was he queer the judge wanted to know.",
    "Vera said in a low voice\n\n    He said we were all going to diehe said he was waiting for the end.",
    "Hehe\n\n    frightened me. . . .",
    "The judge nodded.",
    "He said\n\nWhat did you do next\n\nI went back to the house.",
    "Then just before lunch I went out again and\n\nup behind the house.",
    "Ive been terribly restless all day.",
    "Mr. Justice Wargrave stroked his chin.",
    "He said\n\nThere remains Rogers.",
    "Though I doubt if his evidence will add anything to\n\nour sum of knowledge.",
    "Rogers summoned before the court had very little to tell.",

    "He had not\n\nlooked out of the window during the morning and had seen nothing that could\n\nhave any bearing upon the death of General Macarthur.",
    "He would swear\n\ndefinitely that there had been eight china figures upon the diningtable\n\nwhen he laid the table for lunch.",
    "At the conclusion of Rogers evidence there was a pause.",
    "Mr. Justice Wararave cleared his throat.",
    "Lombard murmured to Vera Claythorne\n\nThe summing up will now take place\n\nThe judge said\n\nWe have inquired into the circumstances of these three deaths to the best\n\nof our ability.",
    "Whilst probability in some cases is against certain people\n\nbeing implicated yet we cannot say definitely that any one person can be\n\nconsidered as cleared of all complicity.",
    "I reiterate my positive belief\n\nthat of the seven persons assembled in this room one is a dangerous and\n\nprobably insane criminal.",
    "There is no evidence before us as to who that\n\fperson is.",
    "All we can do at the present juncture is to consider what\n\nmeasures we can take for communicating with the mainland for help and in\n\nthe event of help being delayed as is only too possible given the state\n\nof the weather what measures we must adopt to ensure our safety.",
    "I would ask you all to consider this carefully and to give me any\n\nsuggestions that may occur to you.",
    "In the meantime I warn everybody to be\n\nupon his or her guard.",
    "So far the murderer has had an\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\ni\n\n284       MASTERPIECES OF MURDER\n\n\n\neasy task since his victims have been unsuspicious.",

    "Outside\n\nthe rain poured down and the wind howled in great shuddering gusts against\n\fthe windowpanes.",
    "Philip Lombard cocked his head slightly on one side before answering.",
    "Then\n\nhe said\n\nCYou mean do I believe that old Wargrave is right when he says its one\n\nof us Yes.",
    "Philip Lombard said slowly\n\nIts difficult to say.",
    "Logically you know hes right and yet\n\nVera took the words out of his mouth.",
    "And yet it seems so incredible\n\nPhilip Lombard made a grimace.",
    "The whole things incredible But after Macarthurs death theres no more\n\ndoubt as to one thing.",
    "Theres no question now of accidents or suicides.",
    "Its definitely murder.",

    "Presently a tap will come on the door and early morning tea will\n\nbe brought in.",

    "With a slightly wry smile Vera said\n\nThank you.",
    "He said\n\nCome now Miss Vera Claythome arent you going to return the compliment\n\nVera hesitated a minute then she said\n\nYouve admitted you know that you dont hold human life par\n\ntularly sacred but all the same I cant see you asas the man who\n\ndictated that gramophone record.",
    "Lombard said\n\nQuite right.",
    "If I were to commit one or more murders it would be solely\n\nfor what I could get out of them.",
    "This mass clearance isnt my line of\n\ncountry.",
    "Good then well eliminate ourselves and concentrate on our five\n\nfellow prisoners.",
    "Which of them is U. N. Owen Well at a guess and with\n\nabsolutely nothing to go upon Id plump for Wargrave\n\nOh Vera sounded surprised.",
    "She thought a minute or two and then said\n\nWhy Hard to say exactly.",
    "But to begin with hes an old man and hes\n\nbeen presiding over courts of law for years.",
    "That is to say hes played\n\fGod Almighty for a good many months every year.",
    "That must go to a mans\n\nhead eventually.",

    "Vera said slowly\n\nYes I suppose thats possible.",
    "Lombard said\n\nWho do you plump for\n\nWithout any hesitation Vera answered\n\nDr. Armstrong.",
    "Lombard gave a low whistle.",
    "The doctor ch You know I should have put him last of all.",
    "Vera shook her head.",
    "Oh no Two of the deaths have been poison.",
    "That rather points\n\n286      MASTERPIECES OF MURDER\n\n\n\nto a doctor.",
    "And then you cant get over the fact that the only thing we are\n\nabsolutely certain Mrs. Rogers had was the sleeping draught that he gave\n\nher.",
    "Lombard admitted\n\nYes thats true.",
    "Vera persisted\n\nIf a doctor went mad it would be a long time before any one suspected.",
    "And doctors overwork and have a lot of strain.",
    "Philip Lombard said\n\nYes but I doubt if he could have killed Macarthur.",
    "He wouldnt have had\n\ftime during that brief interval when I left himnot that is unless he\n\nfairly hared down there and back again and I doubt if hes in good enough\n\ntraining to do that and show no signs of it.",

    "He said\n\nSo you think he did it then Pretty cool thing to do.",

    "I wonder\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nWho is it Mr. Blore Thats what I want to know.",
    "Who is it\n\nRogers face was working.",
    "His hands were clenched round the polishing\n\nleather that he held in his hand.",

    "Which one Thats what I want to know.",
    "Whos\n\nthe fiend inuman form\n\nThat said Blore is what we all would like to know.",

    "I intend to take every possible\n\nprecaution against such a thing happening.",
    "It flashed across Dr. Armstrongs mind that an old man like the judge was\n\nfar more tenacious of life than a younger man would be.",
    "He had often\n\nmarvelled at that fact in his professional career.",
    "Here was he junior to\n\nthe judge by perhaps twenty years and yet with a vastly inferior sense of\n\nselfpreservation.",
    "Mr. Justice Wargrave was thinking\n\nMurdered in our beds These doctors are all the samethey think in\n\ncliches.",
    "A thoroughly commonplace mind.",
    "The doctor said\n\nThere have been three victims already remember.",
    "Certainly.",
    "But you must remember that they were unprepared for the attack.",
    "We are forewarned.",
    "Dr. Arrnstron4 said bitterly\n\n288        MASTERPIECES OF MURDER\n\n\n\nWhat can we do Sooner or later\n\nI think said Mr. Justice Wargrave that there are several things we can\n\ndo.",

    "Armstrong stared at him.",
    "Do you mean you know\n\nMr. Justice Wargrave said cautiously\n\nAs regards actual evidence such as is necessary in court I admit that\n\nI have none.",

    "And again we cant prove it.",
    "He was a very careful\n\nman Morris.",
    "And he was behind this island business\n\nYes sir he put through the salethough he made it clear that he was\n\nbuying Indian Island for a third party unnamed.",
    "Surely theres something to be found out on the financial angle there\n\nInspector Maine smiled.",
    "Not if you knew Morris He can wangle figures until the best chartered\n\naccountant in the country wouldnt know if he was on his head or his heels\n\nWeve had a taste of that in the Bermito business.",
    "No he covered his\n\nemployers tracks all right.",
    "The other man sighed.",
    "Inspector Maine went on\n\nIt was Morris who made all the arrangements down at Sticklehaven.",
    "Represented himself as acting for Mr. Owen.",
    "And it was he who explained\n\nto the people down there that there was some experiment onsome bet about\n\nliving on a desert island for a weekand that no notice was to be taken\n\nof any appeal for help from out there.",
    "Sir Thomas Legge stirred uneasily.",
    "He said\n\nAnd youre telling me that those people didnt smell a rat Not even\n\nthen Maine shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said\n\nYoure forgetting sir that Indian Island previously belonged to young\n\nElmer Robson the American.",
    "He had the most extraordinary parties down\n\fthere.",
    "Ive no doubt the local peoples eyes fairly popped out over them.",
    "But they got used to it and theyd begun to feel that anything to do with\n\nIndian Island would necessarily be incredible.",
    "Its natural that sir\n\nwhen you come to think of it.",
    "The Assistant Commissioner admitted gloomily that he supposed it\n\n\n\nwas.",
    "Maine said\n\nFred Narracottthats the man who took the party out theredid\n\n344\n\n\n\nMASTERPIECES OF MURDER\n\n\n\nsay one thing that was illuminating.",
    "He said he was surprised to see what\n\nsort of people these were.",
    "Not at all like Mr. Robsons parfies.",
    "I think\n\nit was the fact that they were all so normal and so quiet that made him\n\noverride Morris orders and take out a boat to the island after hed heard\n\nabout the S 0 S signals.",
    "When did he and the other men go\n\nThe signals were seen by a party of boy scouts on the morning of the I I\n\nth.",
    "There was no possibility of getting out there that day.",
    "The men got\n\nthere on the afternoon of the 12th at the first moment possible to run a\n\nboat ashore there.",
    "Theyre all quite positive that nobody could have left\n\nthe island before they got there.",
    "There was a big sea on after the storm.",
    "Couldnt some one have swum ashore\n\nIts over a mile to the coast and there were heavy seas and big breakers\n\finshore.",
    "And there were a lot of people boy scouts and others on the cliffs\n\nlooking out towards the island and watching.",
    "The A.C. sighed.",
    "He said\n\nWhat about that gramophone record you found in the house Couldnt you get\n\nhold of anything there that might help\n\nInspector Maine said\n\nIve been into that.",
    "It was supplied by a firm that do a lot of theatrical\n\nstuff and film effects.",
    "It was sent to U. N. Owen Esq.",

    "The typescript of it was returned with the record.",
    "Legge said\n\nAnd what about the subject matter eh\n\nInspector Maine said gravely\n\nIm coming to that sir.",
    "He cleared his throat.",
    "Ive investigated those accusations as thoroughly as I can.",
    "Starting with the Rogerses who were the first to arrive on the island.",
    "They were in service with a Miss Brady who died suddenly.",
    "Cant get\n\nanything definite out of the doctor who attended her.",
    "He says they\n\ncertainly didnt poison her or anything like that but his personal belief\n\nis that there was some funny businessthat she died as the result of\n\nneglect on their part.",
    "Says its the sort of thing thats quite impossible\n\nto prove.",
    "Then there is Mr. Justice Wargrave.",
    "Thats O.K.",
    "He was the judge who\n\nsentenced Seton.",
    "By the way Scion was guiltyunmistakably guilty.",
    "Evidence turned uD later\n\fafter he was hanged which nroved thnt hPunnrl n\n\n\n\nAND THEN THERE WERE NONE\n\n\n\n345\n\n\n\nshadow of doubt.",
    "But there was a good deal of comment at the timenine people\n\nout of ten thought Seton was innocent and that the judges summing up had\n\nbeen vindictive.",
    "The Claythome girl I find was governess in a family where a death\n\noccurred by drowning.",
    "However she doesnt seem to have had anything to do\n\nwith it and as a matter of fact she behaved very well swam out to the\n\nrescue and was actually carried out to sea and only just rescued in time.",
    "Go on said the A.C. with a sigh.",
    "Maine took a deep breath.",
    "Dr. Armstrong now.",
    "Wellknown man.",
    "Had a consulting room in Harley Street.",
    "Absolutely straight and aboveboard in his profession.",

    "Maine went on\n\nThere were ten people to beexecuted lets say.",
    "They were executed.",
    "U.\n\nN. Oven accomplished his task.",

    "The A.C. said\n\nFirstclass vanishing trick.",
    "But you know Maine there must be an\n\nexplanation.",
    "Maine said\n\nYoure thinking sir that if the man wasnt on the island he couldnt\n\nhave left the island and according to the account of the interested\n\nparties he never was on the island.",
    "Well then the only explanation\n\npossible is that he was actually one of the ten.",
    "The A.C. nodded.",
    "Maine said earnestly\n\nWe thought of that sir.",
    "We went into it.",
    "Now to begin with were not\n\nquite in the dark as to what happened on Indian Island.",
    "Vera Claythorne\n\nkept a diary so did Emily Brent.",

    "Now Sir it seemed to me taking\n\neverything into account that we might find here a perfectly good solution.",
    "Armstrong was drowned you remember.",
    "Granting that Armstrong was mad what\n\nwas to prevent him having killed off all the others and then committed\n\nsuicide by throwing himself over the cliff or perhaps while trying to swim\n\nto the mainland\n\nThat was a good solutionbut it wont do.",
    "No sir it wont do.",
    "First of\n\nall theres the police surgeons evidence.",
    "He got to the island early on\n\nthe morning of August 13th.",
    "He couldnt say much to help us.",
    "All he could\n\nsay was that all the people had been dead at least thirtysix hours and\n\nprobably a good deal longer.",
    "But he was fairly definite about Armstrong.",
    "Said he must have been from eight to ten hours in the water before s bodv\n\nwas washed uD That works out at\n 348\n\n\n\nMASTERPIECES OF MURDER\n\fthis that Armstrong must have gone into the sea sometime during the night\n\nof the 10thllthand Ill explain why.",
    "We found the point where the body was\n\nwashed upit had been wedged between two rocks and there were bits of cloth\n\nhair etc.",
    "on them.",
    "It must have been deposited there at high water on the\n\n11 ththats to say round about 11 oclock A.M. After that the storm\n\nsubsided and succeeding high water marks are considerably lower.",
    "You might say I suppose that Armstrong managed to polish off the other\n\nthree before he went into the sea that night.",
    "But theres another point and\n\none you cant get over.",
    "Armstrongs body had been dragged above high water\n\nmark.",
    "We found it well above the reach of any tide.",
    "And it was laid out\n\nstraight on the groundall neat and tidy.",
    "So that settles one point definitely.",
    "Some one was alive on the island\n\nafter Armstrong was dead.",
    "He paused and then went on.",
    "And that leavesjust what exactly Heres the position early on the\n\nmorning of the 11th.",

    "That leaves us\n\nthree people.",
    "Lombard Blore and Vera Claythorne.",
    "Lombard was shot.",
    "His\n\nbody was down by the seanear Armstrongs.",
    "Vera Claythorne was found hanged\n\nin her own bedroom.",
    "Blores body was on the terrace.",
    "His head was crushed\n\nin by a heavy marble clock that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him\n\nfrom the window above.",
    "The A.C. said sharply\n\nWhose window\n\nVera Claythornes.",
    "Now Sir lets take each of these cases separately.",
    "First Philip Lombard.",
    "Lets say he pushed over that lump of marble onto\n\nBlorethen he doped Vera Claythorne and strung her up.",
    "Lastly he went down\n\fto the seashore and shot himself.",
    "But if so who took away the revolver from him For that revolver was\n\nfound up in the house just inside the door at the top of the stairs\n\nWargraves room.",
    "The A.C. said\n\nAny fingerprints on it\n\nYes sir Vera Claythornes.",
    "But man alive then\n\nI know what youre going to say Sir.",
    "That it was Vera Claythorne.",
    "That\n\nshe shot Lombard took the revolver back to the house toppled the marble\n\nblock onto Blore and thenhanged herself.",
    "And thats quite all rightup to a point.",
    "Theres a chair in her bedroom\n\nand on the seat of it there are marks of seaweed same as on\n\n\n\nAND THEN THERE WERE NONE\n\n\n\n349\n\n\n\nher shoes.",
    "Looks as though she stood on the chair adjusted the rope round\n\nher neck and kicked away the chair.",
    "But that chair wasnt found kicked over.",
    "It was like all the other\n\nchairs neatly put back against the wall.",
    "That was done after Vera\n\nClaythornes deathby some one else.",
    "That leaves us with Blore and if you tell me that after shooting Lombard\n\nand inducing Vera Claythorne.",
    "to hang herself he then went out and pulled\n\ndown a whacking great block of marble on himself by tying a string to it\n\nor something like thatwell I simply dont believe you.",
    "Men dont commit\n\fsuicide that wayand whats more Blore wasnt that kind of man.",
    "We knew\n\nBloreand he was not the man that youd ever accuse of a desire for\n\nabstract justice.",
    "The Assistant Commi sioner said\n\n141 agee.",
    "Inspector Maine said\n\nAnd therefore Sir there must have been some one else on the island.",
    "Some\n\none who tidied up when the whole business was over.",
    "But where was he all\n\nthe timeand where did he go to The Sticklehaven people are absolutely\n\ncertain that no one could have left the island before the rescue boat got\n\nthere.",
    "But in that case He stopped.",
    "The Assistant Commissioner said\n\nIn that case\n\nHe sighed.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "He leant forward.",

    "I remember experiments with\n\nwaspswith various garden pests. . . . From an early age I knew very strongly\n\nthe lust to kill.",

    "His appearance and manner were misleading and he created\n\na good impression on the jury.",

    "He suffered from indigestion.",
    "Before\n\nleaving London I gave him a capsule to take last thing at night which had\n\nI said done wonders for my own gastric juices.",
    "He accepted it\n\funhesitatinglythe man was a slight hypochondriac.",
    "I had no fear that he\n\nwould leave any compromising documents or memoranda behind.",
    "He was not that\n\nsort of man.",
    "The order of death upon the island had been subjected by me to special\n\nthought and care.",
    "There were I considered amongst my guests varying\n\ndegrees of guilt.",
    "Those whose guilt was the lightest should I decided\n\npass out first and not suffer the prolonged mental strain and fear that\n\nthe more coldblooded offenders were to suffer.",
    "Anthony Marston and Mrs. Rogers died first the one instantaneously the\n\nother in a peaceful sleep.",
    "Marston I recognized was a type born without\n\nthat feeling of moral responsibility which most of us have.",

    "Mrs. Rogers I had no doubt had acted very largely under the\n\ninfluence of her husband.",
    "I need not describe closely how those two met\n\ntheir deaths.",
    "The police will have been able to work that out quite easily.",
    "Potassium Cyanide is easily obtained by householders for putting down\n\nwasps.",
    "I had some in my possession and it was easy to slip it into\n\nMarstons almost empty glass during the tense period after the gramophone\n\nrecital.",
    "I may say that I watched the faces of my guests closely during that\n\nindictment and I had no doubt whatever after my long court experience\n\nthat one and all were guilty.",
    "During recent bouts of pain I had been ordered a sleeping draught Chloral\n\nHydrate.",
    "It had been easy for me to suppress this until I had a lethal\n\namount in my possession.",

    "As I had anticipated a search was made of the island and it was discovered\n\nthat there was no one on it but our seven selves.",
    "That at once created an\n\natmosphere of suspicion.",
    "According to my plan I\n\n\n\nAND THEN THERE WERE NONE\n\n\n\nshould shortly need an ally.",
    "I selected Dr. Armstrong for that part.",
    "He was\n\na gullible sort of man he knew me by sight and reputation and it was\n\ninconceivable to him that a man of my standing should actually be a\n\nmurderer All his suspicions were directed against Lombard and I pretended\n\nto concur in these.",
    "I hinted to him that I had a scheme by which it might\n\nbe possible to trap the murderer into in criminating himself.",
    "Though a search had been made of every ones room no search had as yet\n\nbeen made of the persons themselves.",
    "But that was bound to come soon.",
    "I killed Rogers on the morning of August 10th.",
    "He was chopping sticks for\n\nlighting the fire and did not hear me approach.",
    "I found the key to the\n\ndiningroom door in his pocket.",

    "We all submitted to a rigorous search.",
    "I had safely\n\nhidden away the revolver and had no more Cyanide or Chloral in my\n\npossession.",
    "It was then that I intimated to Armstrong that we must carry\n\nour plan into effect.",
    "It was simply thisI must appear to be the next\n\nvictim.",
    "That would perhaps rattle the murdererat any rate once I was\n\nsupposed to be dead I could move about the house and spy upon the unknown\n\nmurderer.",
    "Armstrong was keen on the idea.",
    "We carried it out that evening.",
    "A little\n\nplaster of red mud on the foreheadthe red curtain and the wool and the\n\nstage was set.",

    "I took him up a little way behind the house on the edge of the cliff.",
    "I\n\nsaid that here we could see if any one else approached us and we should\n\nnot be seen from the house as the bedrooms faced the other way.",
    "He was\n\nstill quite unsuspiciousand yet he ought to have been warned If he had\n\nonly remembered the words of the nursery rhyme A red herring swallowed\n\none .",
    "He took the red herring all right.",
    "It was quite easy.",
    "I uttered an\n\nexclamation leant over the cliff told him to look wasnt that the mouth\n\nof a cave He leant right over.",
    "A quick vigorous push sent him off his\n\nbalance and splash into the heaving sea below.",
    "I returned to the house.",
    "It\n\nmust have been my footfall that Blore heard.",

    "I shut\n\nthe window and later I broke the glass.",
    "Then I went upstairs and laid\n\nmyself out again on my bed.",
    "I calculated that they would search the house again but I did not think\n\nthey would look closely at any of the corpses a mere twitch aside of the\n\nsheet to satisfy themselves that it was not Armstrong masquerading as a\n\nbody.",
    "This is exactly what occurred.",
    "I forgot to say that I returned the revolver to Lombards room.",
    "It may be\n\nof interest to some one to know where it was hidden during the search.",
    "There was a big pile of tinned food in the larder.",
    "I opened the bottommost\n\nof the tinsbiscuits I think it contained bedded in the revolver and\n\nreplaced the strip of adhesive tape.",
    "I calculated and rightly that no one would think of working their way\n\nthroug4 a pile of apparently untouched foodstuffs especially as all the\n\ntop tins were soldered.",
    "The red curtain I had concealed by laying it flat on the seat of one of the\n\ndrawingroom chairs under the chintz cover and the wool in the seat cushion\n\ncutting a small hole.",
    "And now came the moment that I had anticipatedthree people who were so\n\nfrightened of each other that anything might happen\n\n\n\nAND THEN THERE WERE NONE\n\n\n\nand one of them had a revolver.",
    "I watched them from the windows of the\n\nhouse.",

    "I always thought she was a match for\n\nhim and more.",
    "As soon as that had happened I set the stage in her bedroom.",
    "It was an interesting psychological experiment.",
    "Would the consciousness of\n\nher own guilt the state of nervous tension consequent on having just shot\n\na man be sufficient together with the hypnotic suggestion of the\n\nsurroundings to cause her to take her own life I thought it would.",
    "I was\n\nright.",
    "Vera Claythome hanged herself before my eyes where I stood in the\n\nshadow of the wardrobe.",
    "And now for the last stage.",
    "I came forward picked\n\fup the chair and set it against the wall.",
    "I looked for the revolver and\n\nfound it at the top of the stairs where the girl had dropped it.",
    "I was\n\ncareful to preserve her fingerprints on it.",
    "Andnow\n\nI shall finish writing this.",
    "I shall enclose it and seal it in a bottle and\n\nI shall throw the bottle into the sea.",
    "Why\n\n\n\nYes why .",
    ". .",
    "It was my ambition to invent a murder mystery that no one could solve.",
    "But no artist I now realize can be satisfied with art alone.",
    "There is a\n\nnatural craving for recognition which cannot be gainsaid.",
    "I have let me confess it in all humility a pitiful human wish that some\n\none should know just how clever I have been. . . .",
    "In all this I have assumed that the mystery of Indian Island will remain\n\nunsolved.",
    "It may be of course that the police will be cleverer than I\n\nthink.",
    "There are after all three clues.",
    "One the police are perfectly\n\naware that Edward Seton was guilty.",
    "They know therefore that one of the\n\nten people on the island was not a murderer in any sense of the word and\n\nit follows paradoxically that that person must logically be the murderer.",
    "The second clue lies in the seventh verse of the nursery rhyme.",
    "Armstrongs\n\ndeath is associated with a red herring which he swallowedor rather which\n\nresulted in swallowing him That is to say that at that stage of the affair\n\nsome hocuspocus is clearly indicatedand that Armstrong was deceived by\n\nit and sent to his death.",
    "That might start a promising line of inquiry.",
    "For\n\nat that period there are only four persons and of those four I am clearly\n\nthe only one likely to inspire him with confidence.",
    "MASTERPIECES OF MURDER\n\n\n\nThe third is symbolical.",
    "The manner of my death marking me on the forehead.",
    "The brand of Cain.",
    "There is I think little more to say.",
    "After entrusting my bottle and its message to the sea I shall go to my room\n\nand lay myself down on the bed.",
    "To my eyeglasses is attached what seems a\n\nlength of fine black cordbut it is elastic cord.",
    "I shall lay the weight\n\nof the body on the glasses.",
    "The cord I shall loop round the doorhandle and\n\nattach it not too solidly to the revolver.",
    "What I think will happen is\n\nthis.",
    "My hand protected with a handkerchief will press the trigger.",
    "My hand\n\nwill fall to my side the revolver pulled by the elastic will recoil to\n\nthe door jarred by the doorhandle it will detach itself from the elastic\n\nand fall.",
    "The elastic released will hang down innocently from the\n\neyeglasses on which my body is lying.",
    "A handkerchief lying on the floor\n\nwill cause no comment whatever.",
    "I shall be found laid neatly on my bed\n\nshot through the forehead in accordance with the record kept by my fellow\n\nvictims.",
    "Times of death cannot be stated with any accuracy by the time our\n\nbodies are examined.",
    "When the sea goes down there will come from the mainland boats and men.",
    "And they will find ten dead bodies and an unsolved problem on Indian Island.",
