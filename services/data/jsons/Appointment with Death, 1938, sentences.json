    "You put them under the microscope that is to say\nI suppose you might call it that the girl admitted.",
    "And what were your impressions in this case\nWellshe hesitatedit was rather odd. . . . To begin with the boy flushed\nright up to the roots of his hair.",
    "Is that so remarkable asked Gerard dryly.",
    "Sarah laughed.",
    "You mean that he thought I was a shameless hussy making\nadvances to him Oh no I dont think he thought that.",

    "Excited out of all proportionand quite absurdly apprehensive at the same time.",
    "Now thats odd isnt it because\nIve always found Americans unusually selfpossessed.",
    "An American boy of twenty\nsay has infinitely more knowledge of the world and far more savoirfaire than an\nEnglish boy of the same age.",
    "And this boy must be over twenty.",
    "About twentythree or four I should say.",

    "She came out\nof her meditations with a start.",
    "Raymond Boynton was crossing the room to the\ncenter table.",

    "He saw\nthe boys eyes meet hers.",
    "As Sarah passed Raymond Boynton half turned his headnot towards her but away from her. . . .",
    "It was a slow unwilling motion and conveyed\nthe idea that old Mrs. Boynton had pulled an invisible string.",
    "Sarah King noticed the avoidance and was young enough and human\nenough to be annoyed by it.",
    "They had had such a friendly talk together in the\nswaying corridor of the WagonLit.",

    "The boy had been she\nthought like a nice eager schoolboythere had been perhaps something almost\npathetic about his eagerness.",
    "And now for no reason at all he was shy boorishpositively rude.",
    "I shant take any more trouble with him said Sarah indignantly.",
    "For Sarah\nwithout being unduly conceited had a fairly good opinion of herself.",
    "She knew\nherself to be definitely attractive to the opposite sex and she was not one to take a\nsnubbing lying down She had been perhaps a shade overfriendly to this boy\nbecause for some obscure reason she had felt sorry for him.",
    "But now it was apparent he was merely a rude stuckup boorish young\nAmerican Instead of writing the letters she had mentioned Sarah King sat down in\nfront of her dressingtable combed the hair back from her forehead looked into a\npair of troubled hazel eyes in the glass and took stock of her situation in life.",
    "She had just passed through a difficult emotional crisis.",

    "Sarah\nwas of too imperious a temperament herself to brook a calm assertion of autocracy.",
    "Like many highspirited women Sarah believed herself to admire strength.",
    "She had always told herself that she wanted to be mastered.",
    "When she met a man\ncapable of mastering her she found that she did not like it at all To break off her\nengagement had cost her a good deal of heart burning but she was clearsighted\nenough to realize that mere mutual attraction was not a sufficient basis on which to\nbuild a lifetime of happiness.",
    "She had treated herself deliberately to an interesting\nholiday abroad in order to help on forgetfulness before she went back to start\nworking in earnest.",
    "Sarahs thoughts came back from the past to the present.",
    "I wonder she thought if Dr. Gerard will let me talk to him about his work\nHes done such marvelous work.",
    "If only hell take me seriously .",
    ". . Perhapsif he\ncomes to Petra Then she thought again of the strange boorish young American.",
    "She had no doubt that it was the presence of his family which had caused him\nto react in such a peculiar manner but she felt slightly scornful of him nevertheless.",
    "To be under the thumb of ones family like thatit was really rather ridiculousespecially for a man And yet .",
    ". .\nA queer feeling passed over her.",
    "Surely there was something a little odd\nabout it all\nShe said suddenly out loud That boy wants rescuing Im going to see to it\n3\nWhen Sarah had left the lounge Dr. Gerard sat where he was for some\nminutes.",
    "Then he walked over to the table picked up the latest number of Le Matin\nand strolled with it to a chair a few yards away from the Boynton family.",
    "His curiosity\nwas aroused.",
    "He had at first been amused by the English girls interest in this American\nfamily shrewdly diagnosing that it was inspired by interest in one particular member\nof the group.",
    "But now something out of the ordinary about this family party awakened\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie\n\n9\n\nin him the deeper more impartial interest of the scientist.",
    "He sensed that there was\nsomething here of definite psychological interest.",
    "Very discreetly under the cover of his paper he took stock of them.",
    "First the\nboy in whom that attractive English girl took such a decided interest.",
    "Yes thought\nGerard definitely the type to appeal to her temperamentally.",
    "Sarah King had\nstrengthshe possessed wellbalanced nerves cool wits and a resolute will.",
    "Dr.\nGerard judged the young man to be sensitive perceptive diffident and intensely\nsuggestible.",
    "He noted with a physicians eye the obvious fact that the boy was at the\nmoment in a state of high nervous tension.",
    "Dr. Gerard wondered why.",
    "He was\npuzzled.",
    "Why should a young man whose physical health was obviously good who\nwas abroad ostensibly enjoying himself be in such a condition that a nervous\nbreakdown was imminent\nThe doctor turned his attention to the other members of the party.",

    "Ordinary commonplace tourists talk.",
    "And yet somehow Dr. Gerard felt a\nqueer conviction that these overheard scraps of dialogue were all singularly unreal.",

    "Now I dont know what you\nthink Dr. Gerard but I dont think thats always a very sound thing.",
    "I agree with you.",
    "It is most harmful to developing mentalities.",
    "Yes I should say that just about expresses it.",
    "Mrs. Boynton shielded these\nchildren from the outside world and never let them make any outside contacts.",
    "The\nresult of that is that theyve grown upwell kind of nervy.",

    "Do you put the blame for that on them or on Mrs. Boynton\nJefferson Cope shifted uneasily.",

    "Pardon\nMy dear sir chivalry only lives nowadays in the American nation You are\ncontent to serve your lady without hope of reward It is most admirable that What\nexactly do you hope to be able to do for her\nMy idea is to be right here at hand if she needs me.",

    "It is purely platonic.",
    "My dear sir I am quite sure of that.",

    "It has been estimated that four milligrams might prove fatal to an adult man.",
    "And Mrs. Boynton already suffered with heart trouble\nYes as a matter of fact she was actually taking a medicine containing\ndigitalis.",

    "Dyou mean asked Colonel Carbury that her death might have been\nattributed to an overdose of her own medicine\nThatyes.",
    "But I meant more than that.",

    "Colonel Carbury looked at him curiously.",
    "Well he said.",
    "Whats your expert\nopinion Was it murderor wasnt it\nPoirot held up a hand.",
    "One moment.",
    "We have not yet arrived at that point.",
    "There is still some evidence to consider.",
    "What evidence Youve had it all.",
    "Ah But this is evidence that I Hercule Poirot bring to you.",

    "In the Solomon Hotel one night I go to the\nwindow to make sure it is closed\nClosedor open asked Carbury.",
    "Closed said Poirot firmly.",

    "I say to myself it is a\nvoice I will know again.",
    "And what does it say this voice It says these words You\ndo see dont you that shes got to be killed\nHe paused.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 51\n\nAt the moment naturellement I do not take those words as referring to a\nkilling of flesh and blood.",
    "I think it is an author or perhaps a playwright who speaks.",
    "But now I am not so sure.",
    "That is to say I am sure it was nothing of the kind.",
    "Again he paused before saying Messieurs I will tell you thisto the best of\nmy knowledge and belief those words were spoken by a young man whom I saw\nlater in the lounge of the hotel and who was so they told me on inquiring a young\nman of the name of Raymond Boynton.",
    "3\nRAYMOND BOYNTON SAID THAT The exclamation broke from the\nFrenchman.",

    "Gerard shook his head.",
    "No I should not say that.",
    "I was surprised yes.",
    "If you\nfollow me I was surprised just because Raymond Boynton was so eminently fitted to\nbe a suspect.",
    "Colonel Carbury sighed.",

    "Question is he murmured what are we going to do about it\nGerard shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I do not see what you can do he confessed.",
    "The evidence is bound to be inconclusive.",
    "You may know that murder has been\ndone but it will be difficult to prove it.",
    "I see said Colonel Carbury.",
    "We suspect that murders been done and we\njust sit back and twiddle our fingers Dont like it He added as if in extenuation his\nformer odd plea Im a tidy man.",
    "I know.",
    "I know Poirot nodded his head sympathetically.",
    "You would like to\nclear this up.",
    "You would like to know definitely exactly what occurred and how it\noccurred.",
    "And you.",
    "Dr. Gerard You have said that there is nothing to be donethat\nthe evidence is bound to be inconclusive That is probably true.",
    "But are you satisfied\nthat the matter should rest so\nShe was a bad life said Gerard slowly.",
    "In any case she might have died\nvery shortlya weeka montha year.",
    "So you are satisfied persisted Poirot.",
    "Gerard went on There is no doubt that her death washow shall we put itbeneficial to the community.",
    "It has brought freedom to her family.",
    "They will have\nscope to developthey are all I think people of good character and intelligence.",
    "They will be now useful members of society The death of Mrs. Boynton as I see it\nhas resulted in nothing but good.",
    "Poirot repeated for the third time So you are satisfied\nNo.",
    "Dr. Gerard pounded a fist suddenly on the table.",
    "I am not satisfied as\nyou put it It is my instinct to preserve lifenot to hasten death.",
    "Therefore though my\nconscious mind may repeat that this womans death was a good thing my\nunconscious mind rebels against it It is not well gentlemen that a human being\nshould die before his or her time has come.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "He leaned back contented with the answer he had probed for\nso patiently.",

    "Is there anything to be done about it We dont like itno But we may\nhave to lump it No good making a fuss if you cant deliver the goods.",
    "Gerard leaned forward.",
    "What is your professional opinion M. Poirot You are\nthe expert.",
    "Poirot took a little time to speak.",
    "Methodically he arranged an ashtray or two\nand made a little heap of used matches.",
    "Then he said You desire to know do you\nnot Colonel Carbury who killed Mrs. Boynton That is if she was killed and did not\ndie a natural death.",
    "Exactly how and when she was killedand in fact the whole\ntruth of the matter\nI should like to know that yes.",
    "Carbury spoke unemotionally.",
    "Hercule Poirot said slowly I see no reason why you should not know it\nDr. Gerard looked incredulous.",
    "Colonel Carbury looked mildly interested.",
    "Oh he said.",
    "So you dont dont you Thats interestin.",
    "How dyou propose to set\nabout it\nBy methodical sifting of the evidence by a process of reasoning.",
    "Suits me said Colonel Carbury.",
    "And by a study of the psychological possibilities.",
    "Suits Dr. Gerard I expect said Carbury.",
    "And after that after youve sifted\nthe evidence and done some reasoning and paddled in psychologyhey prestoyou\nthink you can produce the rabbit out of the hat\nI should be extremely surprised if I could not do so said Poirot calmly.",
    "Colonel Carbury stared at him over the rim of his glass.",
    "Just for a moment the\nvague eyes were no longer vague they measuredand appraised.",
    "He put down his\nglass with a grunt.",
    "What do you say to that Dr. Gerard\nI admit that I am skeptical of success .",
    ". . yet I know that M. Poirot has great\npowers.",
    "I am giftedyes said the little man.",
    "He smiled modestly.",
    "Colonel Carbury turned away his head and coughed.",
    "Poirot said The first thing to decide is whether this is a composite murderplanned and carried out by the Boynton family as a whole or whether it is the work\nof one of them only.",
    "If the latter which is the most likely member of the family to\nhave attempted it\nDr. Gerard said There is your own evidence.",
    "One must I think consider first\nRaymond Boynton.",
    "I agree said Poirot.",
    "The words I overheard and the discrepancy between\nhis evidence and that of the young woman doctor puts him definitely in the forefront\nof the suspects.",
    "He was the last person to see Mrs. Boynton alive.",
    "That is his own\nstory Sarah King contradicts that.",
    "Tell me Dr. Gerard is thereehyou know what I\nmeana little tendresse shall we saythere\nThe Frenchman nodded.",
    "Emphatically so.",
    "Alas Is she this young lady a brunette with hair that goes back from her\nforeheadsoand big hazel eyes and a manner very decided\nDr. Gerard looked rather surprised.",
    "Yes that describes her very well.",
    "I think I have seen herin the Solomon Hotel.",
    "She spoke to this Raymond\nBoynton and afterwards he remained plant\u00e9 lain a dreamblocking the exit from the\nlift.",
    "Three times I had to say Pardon before he heard me and moved.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 53\n\nPoirot remained in thought for some moments.",
    "Then he said So to begin\nwith we will accept the medical evidence of Miss Sarah King with certain mental\nreservations.",
    "She is an interested party.",
    "He pausedthen went on Tell me Dr.\nGerard do you think Raymond Boynton is of the temperament that could commit\nmurder easily\nGerard said slowly You mean deliberate planned murder Yes I think it is\npossiblebut only under conditions of intense emotional strain.",
    "Those conditions were present\nDefinitely.",
    "This journey abroad undoubtedly heightened the nervous and\nmental strain under which all these people were living.",
    "The contrast between their\nown lives and those of other people was more apparent to them.",
    "And in Raymond\nBoyntons case\nYes\nThere was the additional complication of being strongly attracted to Sarah\nKing.",
    "That would give him an additional motive And an additional stimulus\nThat is so.",
    "Colonel Carbury coughed.",
    "Like to butt in a moment.",
    "That sentence of his you\noverheardYou do see dont you that shes got to be killedmust have been\nspoken to someone.",
    "A good point said Poirot.",
    "I had not forgotten it.",
    "Yes to whom was\nRaymond Boynton speaking Undoubtedly to a member of his family.",
    "But which\nmember Can you tell us something Doctor of the mental conditions of the other\nmembers of the family\nGerard replied promptly.",
    "Carol Boynton was I should say in very much the\nsame state as Raymonda state of rebellion accompanied by severe nervous\nexcitement but uncomplicated in her case by the introduction of a sex factor.",
    "Lennox\nBoynton had passed the stage of revolt.",
    "He was sunk in apathy.",
    "He was finding it I\nthink difficult to concentrate.",
    "His method of reaction to his surroundings was to retire\nfurther and further within himself.",
    "He was definitely an introvert.",
    "And his wife\nHis wife though tired and unhappy showed no signs of mental conflict.",
    "She\nwas I believe hesitating on the brink of a decision.",
    "Such a decision being\nWhether or not to leave her husband.",
    "He repeated the conversation he had held with Jefferson Cope.",
    "Poirot nodded in comprehension.",

    "Unable to bear the suppression of her life she is escaping into a\nrealm of fantasy.",
    "She has advanced delusions of persecutionthat is to saw she\nclaims to be a Royal Personage in danger enemies surrounding her all the usual\nthings\nAnd that is dangerous\nVery dangerous.",

    "He or she kills in order not\nto be killed themselves.",
    "From their point of view it is eminently rational.",
    "So you think that Ginevra Boynton might have killed her mother\nYes.",
    "But I doubt if she would have had the knowledge or the\nconstructiveness to do it the way it was done.",
    "The cunning of that class of mania is\nusually very simple and obvious.",
    "And I am almost certain she would have chosen a\nmore spectacular method.",
    "But she is a possibility Poirot insisted.",
    "Yes admitted Gerard.",
    "And afterwardswhen the deed was done Do you think the rest of the family\nknew who had done it\nThey know said Colonel Carbury unexpectedly.",
    "If ever I came across a\nbunch of people who had something to hide these are they Theyre putting\nsomething over all right.",
    "We will make them tell us what it is said Poirot.",
    "Third degree said Colonel Carbury raising his eyebrows.",
    "No.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "Just ordinary conversation.",
    "On the whole you\nknow people tell you the truth.",
    "Because it is easier Because it is less strain on the\ninventive faculties You can tell one lieor two lies or three or even four liesbut you\ncannot lie all the time.",
    "The truth becomes plain.",
    "Something in that agreed Carbury.",
    "Then he said bluntly Youll talk to them\nyou say That means youre willing to take this on\nPoirot bowed his head.",
    "Let us be very clear about this he said.",
    "What you\ndemand and what I undertake to supply is the truth.",
    "But mark this even when we\nhave got the truth there may be no proof.",
    "That is to say no proof that would be\naccepted in a court of law.",
    "You comprehend\nQuite said Carbury.",
    "You satisfy me of what really happened then its up to\nme to decide whether action is possible or nothaving regard to the International\naspects.",
    "Anyway it will be cleared upno mess.",
    "Dont like a mess.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "One more thing said Carbury.",
    "I cant give you much time.",
    "Cant detain\nthese people here indefinitely.",

    "You shall have\nthe truth by tomorrow night.",
    "Colonel Carbury stared hard at him.",
    "Pretty confident arent you he asked.",
    "I know my own ability murmured Poirot.",
    "Rendered uncomfortable by this unBritish attitude Colonel Carbury looked\naway and fingered his untidy moustache.",
    "Well he mumbled.",
    "Its up to you.",
    "And if you succeed my friend said Dr. Gerard you are indeed a marvel\n4\nSarah King looked long and searchingly at Hercule Poirot.",
    "She saw the eggshaped head the gigantic moustaches the dandified appearance and the suspicious\nblackness of his hair.",
    "A look of doubt crept into her eyes.",
    "Well Mademoiselle are you satisfied\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 55\n\nSarah flushed as he met the amused ironical glance of his eyes.",
    "I beg your\npardon she said awkwardly.",
    "Du tout To use an expression I have recently learnt you give me the one\nover is it not so\nSarah smiled a little.",
    "Well at any rate you can do the same to me she said.",
    "Assuredly.",
    "I have not neglected to do so.",
    "She glanced at him sharply.",
    "Something in his tone But Poirot was twirling his\nmoustaches complacently and Sarah thought for the second time The mans a\nmountebank\nHer selfconfidence restored she sat up a little straighter and said inquiringly\nI dont think I quite understand the object of this interview\nThe good Dr. Gerard did not explain\nSarah said frowning I dont understand Dr. Gerard.",
    "He seems to think\nThat there is something rotten in the state of Denmark.",
    "quoted Poirot.",
    "You\nsee I know your Shakespeare.",
    "Sarah waved aside Shakespeare.",
    "What exactly is all this fuss about she\ndemanded.",
    "Eh bien one wants does one not to get at the truth of this affair\nAre you talking about Mrs. Boyntons death\nYes.",
    "Isnt it rather a fuss about nothing You of course are a specialist M. Poirot.",
    "It is natural for you\nPoirot finished the sentence for her.",
    "It is natural for me to suspect crime\nwhenever I can possibly find an excuse for doing so\nWellyesperhaps.",
    "You have no doubt yourself as to Mrs. Boyntons death\nSarah shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Really M. Poirot if you had been to Petra\nyou would realize that the journey there is a somewhat strenuous business for an old\nwoman whose cardiac condition was unsatisfactory.",
    "It seems a perfectly straightforward business to you\nCertainly.",
    "I cant understand Dr. Gerards attitude.",
    "He didnt even know\nanything about it.",
    "He was down with fever.",
    "Id bow to his superior medical knowledge\nnaturally but in this case he had nothing whatever to go on.",
    "I suppose they can have\na p.m. in Jerusalem if they like if theyre not satisfied with my verdict.",
    "Poirot was silent for a moment then he said There is a fact Miss King that\nyou do not yet know.",
    "Dr. Gerard has not told you of it.",
    "What fact demanded Sarah.",
    "A supply of a drugdigitoxinis missing from Dr. Gerards traveling medicine\ncase.",
    "Oh Quickly Sarah took in this new aspect of the case.",
    "Equally quickly she\npounced on the one doubtful point.",
    "Is Dr. Gerard quite sure of that\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "A doctor as you should know Mademoiselle\nis usually fairly careful in making his statements.",
    "Oh of course.",
    "That goes without saying.",
    "But Dr. Gerard had malaria at the\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 56\n\ntime.",
    "That is so of course.",
    "Has he any idea when it could have been taken\nHe had occasion to go to his case on the night of his arrival in Petra.",
    "He\nwanted some phenacetin as his head was aching badly.",
    "When he replaced the\nphenacetin on the following morning and shut up the case he is almost certain that\nall the drugs were intact.",
    "Almost said Sarah.",
    "Poirot shrugged.",
    "Yes there is a doubt There is the doubt that any man who is honest would\nbe likely to feel.",
    "Sarah nodded.",
    "Yes I know.",
    "One always distrusts those people who are oversure.",
    "But all the same M. Poirot the evidence is very slight.",
    "It seems to me She\npaused.",
    "Poirot finished the sentence for her.",
    "It seems to you that an inquiry on my\npart is illadvised\nSarah looked him squarely in the face.",
    "Frankly it does.",
    "Are you sure M.\nPoirot that this is not a case of Roman Holiday\nPoirot smiled.",
    "The private lives of a family upset and disturbedso that\nHercule Poirot can play a little game of detection to amuse himself\nI didnt mean to be offensivebut isnt it a little like that\nYou then are on the side of the famille Boynton Mademoiselle\nI think I am.",
    "Theyve suffered a good deal.",
    "Theythey oughtnt to have to\nstand any more.",
    "And la Maman she was unpleasant tyrannical disagreeable and decidedly\nbetter dead than alive That alsohm\nWhen you put it like that Sarah paused flushed went on One shouldnt I\nagree take that into consideration.",
    "But all the same one does That is you do.",
    "Mademoiselle I do not To me it\nis all the same.",
    "The victim may be one of the good Gods saintsor on the contrary a\nmonster of infamy.",
    "It moves me not.",
    "The fact is the same.",
    "A life taken I say it\nalways I do not approve of murder.",
    "Murder Sarah drew in her breath sharply.",
    "But what evidence of that is\nthere The flimsiest imaginable Dr. Gerard himself cannot be sure\nPoirot said quietly But there is other evidence Mademoiselle.",
    "What evidence Her voice was sharp.",
    "The mark of a hypodermic puncture upon the dead womans wrist.",
    "And\nsomething more stillsome words that I overheard spoken in Jerusalem on a clear\nstill night when I went to close my bedroom window.",
    "Shall I tell you what those words\nwere Miss King They were these I heard Mr. Raymond Boynton say You do see\ndont you that shes got to be killed He saw the color drain slowly from Sarahs\nface.",
    "She said You heard that\nYes.",
    "The girl stared straight ahead of her.",
    "She said at last It would be you who\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 57\n\nheard it\nHe acquiesced.",
    "Yes it would be me.",
    "These things happen.",
    "You see now why\nI think there should be an investigation\nSarah said quietly I think you are quite right.",
    "Ah And you will help me\nCertainly.",
    "Her tone was matteroffact unemotional.",
    "Her eyes met his coolly.",
    "Poirot bowed.",
    "Thank you Mademoiselle.",
    "Now I will ask you to tell me in your\nown words exactly what you can remember of that particular day.",
    "Sarah considered for a moment.",
    "Let me see.",
    "I went on an expedition in the\nmorning.",
    "None of the Boyntons were with us.",
    "I saw them at lunch.",
    "They were\nfinishing as we came in.",
    "Mrs. Boynton seemed in an unusually good temper.",
    "She was not usually amiable I understand.",
    "Very far from it said Sarah with a slight grimace.",
    "She then described how\nMrs. Boynton had released her family from attendance on her.",
    "That too was unusual\nYes.",
    "She usually kept them around her.",
    "Do you think perhaps that she suddenly felt remorseful that she had what is\ncalled un bon moment\nNo I dont said Sarah bluntly.",
    "What did you think then\nI was puzzled.",
    "I suspected it was something of the cat and mouse order.",
    "If you would elaborate Mademoiselle\nA cat enjoys letting a mouse away and then catching it again.",
    "Mrs. Boynton\nhad that kind of mentality.",
    "I thought she was up to some new deviltry or other.",
    "What happened next Mademoiselle\nThe Boyntons started off\nAll of them\nNo the youngest Ginevra was left behind.",
    "She was told to go and rest.",
    "Did she wish to do so\nNo.",
    "But that didnt matter.",
    "She did what she was told.",
    "The others started off.",
    "Dr. Gerard and I joined them\nWhen was this\nAbout halfpast three.",
    "Where was Mrs. Boynton then\nNadineyoung Mrs. Boyntonhad settled her in her chair outside her cave.",
    "Proceed.",
    "When we got around the bend Dr. Gerard and I caught up with the others.",
    "We\nall walked together.",
    "Then after a while Dr. Gerard turned back.",
    "He had been looking\nrather queer for some time.",
    "I could see he had fever.",
    "I wanted to go back with him\nbut he wouldnt hear of it.",
    "What time was this\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 58\n\nOh about four I suppose.",
    "And the rest\nWe went on.",
    "Were you all together\nAt first.",
    "Then we split up.",
    "Sarah hurried on as though foreseeing the next\nquestion.",
    "Nadine Boynton and Mr.",
    "Cope went one way and Carol Lennox\nRaymond and I went another.",
    "And you continued like that\nWellno.",
    "Raymond Boynton and I separated from the others.",
    "We sat down on\na slab of rock and admired the wildness of the scenery.",
    "Then he went off and I\nstayed where I was for some time longer.",
    "It was about halfpast five when I looked at\nmy watch and realized I had better get back.",
    "I reached the camp at six oclock.",
    "It was\njust about sunset.",
    "You passed Mrs. Boynton on the way\nI noticed she was still in her chair up on the ridge.",
    "That did not strike you as odd that she had not moved\nNo because I had seen her sitting there the night before when we arrived.",
    "I see.",
    "Continuez.",
    "I went into the marquee.",
    "The others were all thereexcept Dr. Gerard.",
    "I\nwashed and then came back.",
    "They brought in dinner and one of the servants went to\ntell Mrs. Boynton.",
    "He came running back to say she was ill.",
    "I hurried out.",
    "She was\nsitting in her chair just as she had been but as soon as I touched her I realized she\nwas dead.",
    "You had no doubt at all as to her death being natural\nNone whatever.",
    "I had heard that she suffered from heart trouble though no\nspecified disease had been mentioned.",
    "You simply thought she had died sitting there in her chair\nYes.",
    "Without calling out for assistance\nYes.",
    "It happens that way sometimes.",
    "She might even have died in her sleep.",
    "She was quite likely to have dozed off.",
    "In any case all the camp was asleep most of\nthe afternoon.",
    "No one would have heard her unless she had called very loud.",
    "Did you form an opinion as to how long she had been dead\nWell I didnt really think very much about it.",
    "She had clearly been dead some\ntime.",
    "What do you call some time asked Poirot.",
    "Wellover an hour.",
    "It might have been much longer.",
    "The refraction off the\nrock would keep her body from cooling quickly.",
    "Over an hour Are you aware Mademoiselle King that Mr. Raymond\nBoynton spoke to her only a little over half an hour earlier and that she was then\nalive and well\nNow her eyes no longer met his.",
    "But she shook her head.",
    "He must have\nmade a mistake.",
    "It must have been earlier than that.",
    "No Mademoiselle it was not.",
    "She looked at him pointblank.",
    "He noticed\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 59\n\nagain the set of her mouth.",
    "Well said Sarah.",
    "Im young and I havent had much experience with dead\nbodies but I know enough to be quite sure of one thing Mrs. Boynton had been dead\nat least an hour when I examined her body\nThat said Hercule Poirot unexpectedly is your story and you are going to\nstick to it\nIts the truth said Sarah.",
    "Then can you explain why Mr. Boynton should say his mother was alive\nwhen she was in point of fact dead\nIve no idea said Sarah.",
    "Theyre probably rather vague about time all of\nthem Theyre a very nervous family.",
    "On how many occasions Mademoiselle have you spoken with them\nSarah was silent a moment frowning a little.",
    "I can tell you exactly she said.",
    "I talked to Raymond Boynton in the WagonLit corridor coming to Jerusalem.",
    "I had\ntwo conversations with Carol Boyntonone at the Mosque of Omar and one late that\nevening in my bedroom.",
    "I had a conversation with Mrs. Lennox Boynton the following\nmorning.",
    "Thats all up to the afternoon of Mrs. Boyntons death when we all went\nwalking together.",
    "You did not have any conversation with Mrs. Boynton herself\nSarah flushed uncomfortably.",
    "Yes.",
    "I exchanged a few words with her the day\nshe left Jerusalem.",
    "She paused and then blurted out As a matter of fact I made a\nfool of myself.",
    "Ah\nThe interrogation was so patent that stiffly and unwillingly Sarah gave an\naccount of the conversation.",
    "Poirot seemed interested and crossexamined her closely.",
    "The mentality of\nMrs. Boynton it is very important in this case he said.",
    "And you are an outsideran\nunbiased observer.",
    "That is why your account of her is very significant.",
    "Sarah did not reply.",
    "She still felt hot and uncomfortable when she thought of\nthat interview.",
    "Thank you Mademoiselle said Poirot.",
    "I will now converse with the\nother witnesses.",
    "Sarah rose.",
    "Excuse me M. Poirot but if I might make a suggestion\nCertainly.",
    "Certainly.",
    "Why not postpone all this until an autopsy can be made and you discover\nwhether or not your suspicions are justified.",
    "I think all this is rather like putting the\ncart before the horse.",
    "Poirot waved a grandiloquent hand.",
    "This is the method of Hercule Poirot he\nannounced.",
    "Pressing her lips together Sarah left the room.",
    "5\nLADY WESTHOLME ENTERED the room with the assurance of a\ntransatlantic liner coming into dock.",
    "Miss Annabel Pierce an indeterminate craft\nfollowed in the liners wake and sat down in an inferior make of chair slightly in the\nbackground.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 60\n\nCertainly M. Poirot boomed Lady Westholme I shall be delighted to assist\nyou by any means in my power.",
    "I have always considered that in matters of this kind\none has a public duty to perform\nWhen Lady Westholmes public duty had held the stage for some minutes\nPoirot was adroit enough to get in a question.",
    "I have a perfect recollection of the afternoon in question replied Lady\nWestholme.",
    "Miss Pierce and I will do all we can to assist you.",
    "Oh yes sighed Miss Pierce almost ecstatically.",
    "So tragic was it not\nDeadjust like thatin the twinkle of an eye\nIf you will tell me exactly what occurred on the afternoon in question\nCertainly said Lady Westholme.",
    "After we had finished lunch I decided to\ntake a brief siesta.",
    "The morning excursion had been somewhat fatiguing.",
    "Not that I\nwas really tiredI seldom am.",
    "I do not really know what fatigue is.",
    "One has so often\non public occasions no matter what one really feels\nunreadable an adroit murmur from Poirot.",
    "I saw I was in favor of a siesta.",
    "Miss Pierce agreed with me.",
    "Oh yes sighed Miss Pierce.",
    "And I was terribly tired all the morning.",
    "Such a\ndangerous climband although interesting most exhausting.",
    "Im afraid Im not quite\nas strong as Lady Westholme.",
    "Fatigue said Lady Westholme can be conquered like everything else.",
    "I\nmake a point of never giving in to my bodily needs.",
    "Miss Pierce looked at her admiringly.",
    "Poirot said After lunch then you two ladies went to your tents\nYes.",
    "Mrs. Boynton was then sitting at the mouth of her cave\nHer daughterinlaw assisted her there before she herself went off.",
    "You could both see her\nOh yes said Miss Pierce.",
    "She was opposite you knowonly of course a\nlittle way along and up above.",
    "Lady Westholme elucidated the statement.",
    "The caves opened onto a ledge.",
    "Below that ledge were some tents.",
    "Then there was a small stream and across that\nstream was the big marquee and some other tents.",
    "Miss Pierce and I had tents near\nthe marquee.",
    "She was on the right side of the marquee and I was on the left.",
    "The\nopenings of our tents faced the ledge but of course it was some distance away.",
    "Nearly two hundred yards I understand.",
    "Possibly.",
    "I have here a plan said Poirot concocted with the help of the dragoman\nMahmoud.",
    "Lady Westholme remarked that in that case it was probably wrong That man\nis grossly inaccurate.",
    "I have checked his statements from my Baedeker.",
    "Several\ntimes his information was definitely misleading.",
    "According to my plan said Poirot the cave next to Mrs. Boyntons was\noccupied by her son Lennox and his wife.",
    "Raymond Carol and Ginevra Boynton\nhad tents just below but more to the rightin fact almost opposite the marquee.",
    "On\nthe right of Ginevra Boyntons was Dr. Gerards tent and next to his was that of Miss\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 61\n\nKing.",
    "On the other sidenext to the marquee on the leftyou and Mr.",
    "Cope had tents.",
    "Miss Pierces as you mentioned was on the right of the marquee.",
    "Is that correct\nLady Westholme admitted grudgingly that as far as she knew it was.",
    "I thank you.",
    "That is perfectly clear.",
    "Pray continue Lady Westholme.",
    "Lady Westholme smiled graciously on him and went on At about a quarter to\nfour I strolled along to Miss Pierces tent to see if she were awake yet and felt like a\nstroll.",
    "She was sitting in the doorway of the tent reading.",
    "We agreed to start in about\nhalf an hour when the sun was less hot.",
    "I went back to my tent and read for about\ntwentyfive minutes.",
    "Then I went along and joined Miss Pierce.",
    "She was ready and\nwe started out.",
    "Everyone in the camp seemed asleep there was no one about and\nseeing Mrs. Boynton sitting up there alone I suggested to Miss Pierce that we\nshould ask her if she wanted anything before we left.",
    "Yes you did.",
    "Most thoughtful of you I considered it murmured Miss Pierce.",
    "I felt it to be my duty said Lady Westholme with a rich complacency.",
    "And then for her to be so rude about it exclaimed Miss Pierce.",
    "Poirot looked inquiring.",
    "Our path passed just under the ledge explained Lady Westholme and I\ncalled up to her saying that we were going for a stroll and asking could we do\nanything for her before we went.",
    "Do you know M. Poirot absolutely the only answer\nshe gave us was a grunt A grunt She just looked at us as though we wereas\nthough we were dirt\nDisgraceful it was said Miss Pierce flushing.",
    "I must confess said Lady Westholme reddening a little that I then made a\nsomewhat uncharitable remark.",
    "I think you were quite justified said Miss Pierce.",
    "Quiteunder the circumstances.",
    "What was this remark asked Poirot.",
    "I said to Miss Pierce that perhaps she drank Really her manner was most\npeculiar.",
    "It had been all along.",
    "I thought it possible that drink might account for it.",
    "The evils of alcoholic indulgence as I very well know\nDexterously Poirot steered the conversation away from the drink question.",
    "Had her manner been very peculiar on this particular day At lunch time for\ninstance\nNo said Lady Westholme considering.",
    "No I should say that then her\nmanner had been fairly normalfor an American of that type that is to say she\nadded condescendingly.",
    "She was very abusive to that servant said Miss Pierce\nWhich one\nNot very long before we started out.",
    "Oh yes I remember.",
    "She did seem extraordinarily annoyed with him Of\ncourse went on Lady Westholme to have servants about who cannot understand a\nword of English is very trying but what I say is that when one is traveling one must\nmake allowances.",
    "What servant was this asked Poirot.",
    "One of the Bedouin servants attached to the camp.",
    "He went up to her.",
    "I think\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 62\n\nshe must have sent him to fetch her something and I suppose he brought the wrong\nthing.",
    "I dont really know what it was but she was very angry about it.",
    "The poor man\nslunk away as fast as he could and she shook her stick at him and called out.",
    "What did she call out\nWe were too far away to hear.",
    "At least I didnt hear anything distinctly.",
    "Did\nyou Miss Pierce\nNo I didnt.",
    "I think shed sent him to fetch something from her younger\ndaughters tentor perhaps she was angry with him for going into her daughters tentI couldnt say exactly.",
    "What did he look like\nMiss Pierce to whom the question was addressed shook her head vaguely.",
    "Really I couldnt say.",
    "He was too far away.",
    "All these Arabs look alike to me.",
    "He was a man of more than average height said Lady Westholme and\nwore the usual native headdress.",
    "He had on a pair of very torn and patched\nbreechesreally disgraceful they wereand his puttees were wound most untidilyall\nanyhow These men need discipline\nYou could point the man out among the camp servants\nI doubt it.",
    "We didnt see his faceit was too far away.",
    "And as Miss Pierce\nsays really these Arabs all look alike.",
    "I wonder said Poirot thoughtfully what it was he did to make Mrs. Boynton\nso angry\nThey are very trying to the patience sometimes said Lady Westholme.",
    "One\nof them took my shoes away though I had expressly told himby pantomime toothat\nI preferred to clean my shoes myself.",
    "Always I do that too said Poirot diverted for a moment from his\ninterrogation.",
    "I take everywhere my little shoecleaning outfit.",
    "Also I take a duster.",
    "So do I.",
    "Lady Westholme sounded quite human.",
    "Because these Arabs they\ndo not remove the dust from ones belongings\nNever Of course one has to dust ones things three or four times a day\nBut it is well worth it.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "I cannot stand dirt Lady Westholme looked positively militant.",
    "She added with feeling The fliesin the bazaarsterrible\nWell well said Poirot looking slightly guilty.",
    "We can soon inquire from this\nman what it was that irritated Mrs. Boynton.",
    "To continue with your story\nWe strolled along slowly said Lady Westholme.",
    "And then we met Dr.\nGerard.",
    "He was staggering along and looked very ill.",
    "I could see at once he had\nfever.",
    "He was shaking put in Miss Pierce.",
    "Shaking all over.",
    "I saw at once he had an attack of malaria coming on said Lady Westholme.",
    "I offered to come back with him and get him some quinine but he said he had his\nown supply with him.",
    "Poor man said Miss Pierce.",
    "You know it always seems so dreadful to me\nto see a doctor ill.",
    "It seems all wrong somehow.",
    "We strolled on continued Lady Westholme.",
    "And then we sat down on a\nrock.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 63\n\nMiss Pierce murmured Reallyso tired after the mornings exertionthe\nclimbing\nI never feel fatigue said Lady Westholme firmly.",
    "But there was no point in\ngoing further.",
    "We had a very good view of all the surrounding scenery.",
    "Were you out of sight of the camp\nNo we were sitting facing towards it.",
    "So romantic murmured Miss Pierce.",
    "A camp pitched in the middle of a\nwilderness of rosered rocks.",
    "She sighed and shook her head.",
    "That camp could be much better run than it is said Lady Westholme.",
    "Her\nrockinghorse nostrils dilated.",
    "I shall take up the matter with Castles.",
    "I am not at all\nsure that the drinking water is boiled as well as filtered.",
    "It should be.",
    "I shall point that\nout to them.",
    "Poirot coughed and led the conversation quickly away from the subject of\ndrinking water.",
    "Did you see any other members of the party he inquired.",
    "Yes.",
    "The elder Mr. Boynton and his wife passed us on their way back to the\ncamp.",
    "Were they together\nNo Mr. Boynton came first.",
    "He looked a little as though he had had a touch\nof the sun.",
    "He was walking as though he were slightly dizzy.",
    "The back of the neck said Miss Pierce.",
    "One must protect the back of the\nneck I always wear a thick silk handkerchief.",
    "What did Mr. Lennox Boynton do on his return to camp asked Poirot.",
    "For once Miss Pierce managed to get in first before Lady Westholme could\nspeak.",
    "He went right up to his mother but he didnt stay long with her.",
    "How long\nJust a minute or two.",
    "I should put it at just over a minute myself said Lady Westholme.",
    "Then he\nwent on into his cave and after that he went down to the marquee.",
    "And his wife\nShe came along about a quarter of an hour later.",
    "She stopped a minute and\nspoke to usquite civilly.",
    "I think shes very nice said Miss Pierce.",
    "Very nice indeed.",
    "She is not so impossible as the rest of the family allowed Lady Westholme.",
    "You watched her return to the camp\nYes.",
    "She went up and spoke to her motherinlaw.",
    "Then she went into her\ncave and brought out a chair and sat by her talking for some timeabout ten minutes\nI should say.",
    "And then\nThen she took the chair back to the cave and went down to the marquee\nwhere her husband was.",
    "What happened next\nThat very peculiar American came along said Lady Westholme.",
    "Cope I\nthink his name is.",
    "He told us that there was a very good example of the debased\narchitecture of the period just round the bend of the valley.",
    "He said we ought not to\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 64\n\nmiss it.",
    "Accordingly we walked there.",
    "Mr.",
    "Cope had with him quite an interesting\narticle on Petra and the Nabateans.",
    "It was all most interesting declared Miss Pierce fervently.",
    "Lady Westholme continued We strolled back to the camp it being then\nabout twenty minutes to six.",
    "It was growing quite chilly.",
    "Mrs. Boynton was still sitting where you had left her\nYes.",
    "Did you speak to her\nNo.",
    "As a matter of fact I hardly noticed her.",
    "What did you do next\nI went to my tent changed my shoes and got out my own packet of China\ntea.",
    "I then went to the marquee.",
    "The guide person was there and I directed him to\nmake some tea for Miss Pierce and myself with the tea I had brought and to make\nquite sure that the water with which it was made was boiling.",
    "He said that dinner\nwould be ready in about half an hourthe boys were laying the table at the timebut I\nsaid that made no difference.",
    "I always say a cup of tea makes all the difference murmured Miss Pierce\nvaguely.",
    "Was there anyone in the marquee\nOh yes.",
    "Mr. and Mrs. Lennox Boynton were sitting at one end reading.",
    "And\nCarol Boynton was there too.",
    "And Mr.",
    "Cope\nHe joined us at our tea said Miss Pierce.",
    "Though he said tea drinking\nwasnt an American habit.",
    "Lady Westholme coughed.",
    "I became just a little afraid that Mr.",
    "Cope was\ngoing to be a nuisancethat he might fasten himself upon me.",
    "It is a little difficult\nsometimes to keep people at arms length when one is traveling.",
    "I find they are\ninclined to presume.",
    "Americans especially are sometimes rather dense.",
    "Poirot murmured suavely I am sure.",
    "Lady Westholme that you are quite\ncapable of dealing with situations of that kind.",
    "When traveling acquaintances are no\nlonger of any use to you I am sure you are an adept at dropping them.",
    "I think I am capable of dealing with most situations said Lady Westholme\ncomplacently.",
    "The twinkle in Poirots eye was quite lost upon her.",
    "If you will just conclude\nyour recital of the days happenings murmured Poirot.",
    "Certainly.",
    "As far as I can remember Raymond Boynton and the redhaired\nBoynton girl came in shortly afterwards.",
    "Miss King arrived last.",
    "Dinner was then\nready to be served.",
    "One of the servants was dispatched by the dragoman to\nannounce the fact to old Mrs. Boynton.",
    "The man came running back with one of his\ncomrades in a state of some agitation and spoke to the dragoman in Arabic.",
    "There\nwas some mention of Mrs. Boynton being taken ill. Miss King offered her services.",
    "She went out with the dragoman.",
    "She came back and broke the news to the\nmembers of Mrs. Boyntons family.",
    "She did it very abruptly put in Miss Pierce.",
    "Just blurted it out.",
    "I think myself\nit ought to have been done more gradually.",
    "And how did Mrs. Boyntons family take the news asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 65\n\nFor once both Lady Westholme and Miss Pierce seemed a little at a loss.",
    "The\nformer said at last in a voice lacking its usual selfassurance Wellreallyit is\ndifficult to say.",
    "Theythey were very quiet about it.",
    "Stunned said Miss Pierce.",
    "She offered the word more as a suggestion than\nas a fact.",
    "They all went out with Miss King said Lady Westholme.",
    "Miss Pierce and I\nvery sensibly remained where we were.",
    "A faintly wistful look was observable in Miss Pierces eye at this point.",
    "I detest vulgar curiosity continued Lady Westholme.",
    "The wistful look\nbecame more pronounced.",
    "It was clear that Miss Pierce had had perforce to hate\nvulgar curiosity too\nLater concluded Lady Westholme the dragoman and Miss King returned.",
    "I\nsuggested that dinner should be served immediately to the four of us so that the\nBoynton family could dine later in the marquee without the embarrassment of\nstrangers being present.",
    "My suggestion was adopted and immediately after the meal\nI retired to my tent.",
    "Miss King and Miss Pierce did the same.",
    "Mr.",
    "Cope I believe\nremained in the marquee he is a friend of the family and thought he might be of\nsome assistance to them.",
    "That is all I know M. Poirot.",
    "When Miss King had broken the news all the Boynton family accompanied\nher out of the marquee\nYesno I believe now that you come to mention it that the redhaired girl\nstayed behind.",
    "Perhaps you can remember.",
    "Miss Pierce\nYes I thinkI am quite sure she did.",
    "Poirot asked What did she do\nLady Westholme stared at him.",
    "What did she do M. Poirot She did not do\nanything as far as I can remember.",
    "I mean was she sewing or reading did she look anxious did she say\nanything\nWell really Lady Westholme frowned.",
    "Sheershe just sat there as far as I\ncan remember.",
    "She twiddled her fingers said Miss Pierce suddenly.",
    "I remember noticingpoor thing I thought it shows what shes feeling Not that there was anything to\nshow in her face you knowjust her hands turning and twisting.",
    "Once went on Miss Pierce conversationally I remember tearing up a\npound note that waynot thinking of what I was doing.",
    "Shall I catch the first train and\ngo to her I thought it was a great aunt of minetaken suddenly ill or shall I not\nAnd I couldnt make up my mind one way or the other and then I looked down and\ninstead of the telegram I was tearing up a pound notea pound noteinto tiny\npieces Miss Pierce paused dramatically.",
    "Not entirely approving of this sudden bid for the limelight on the part of her\nsatellite Lady Westholme said coldly Is there anything else M. Poirot\nWith a start Poirot seemed to come out of a brown study.",
    "Nothing nothing.",
    "You have been most clearmost definite.",
    "I have an excellent memory said Lady Westholme with satisfaction.",
    "One last little demand.",
    "Lady Westholme said Poirot.",
    "Please continue to sit\nas you are sittingwithout looking around.",
    "Now would you be so kind as to describe\nto me just what Miss Pierce is wearing todaythat is if Miss Pierce does not object\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 66\n\nOh no not in the least twittered Miss Pierce.",
    "Really M. Poirot is there any\nobject\nPlease be so kind as to do as I ask Madame.",
    "Lady Westholme shrugged her shoulders and then said with a rather bad\ngrace Miss Pierce has on a striped brown and white cotton dress and is wearing\nwith it a Sudanese belt of red blue and beige leather.",
    "She is wearing beige silk\nstockings and brown glace strap shoes.",
    "There is a ladder in her left stocking.",
    "She\nhas a necklace of cornelian beads and one of bright royal blue beads and is wearing\na brooch with a pearl butterfly on it.",
    "She has an imitation scarab ring on the third\nfinger of her right hand.",
    "On her head she has a double terai of pink and brown felt.",
    "She pauseda pause of quiet competence.",
    "Then Is there anything further she\nasked coldly.",
    "Poirot spread out his hands in a wide gesture.",
    "You have my entire\nadmiration Madame.",
    "Your observation is of the highest order.",
    "Details rarely escape me.",
    "Lady Westholme rose made a slight inclination of\nher head and left the room.",
    "As Miss Pierce was following her gazing down ruefully\nat her left leg Poirot said A little moment please Mademoiselle\nYes Miss Pierce looked up a slightly apprehensive look upon her face.",
    "Poirot leaned forward confidentially.",
    "You see this bunch of wild flowers on the\ntable here\nYes said Miss Pierce staring.",
    "And you noticed that when you first came into the room I sneezed once or\ntwice\nYes.",
    "Did you notice if I had just been sniffing those flowers\nWellreallynoI couldnt say.",
    "But you remember my sneezing\nOh yes I remember that\nAh wellno matter.",
    "I wondered you see if these flowers might induce the\nhay fever.",
    "No matter\nHay fever cried Miss Pierce.",
    "I remember a cousin of mine was a martyr to\nit She always said that if you sprayed your nose daily with a solution of boracic\nWith some difficulty Poirot shelved the cousins nasal treatment and got rid of\nMiss Pierce.",
    "He shut the door and came back into the room with his eyebrows\nraised.",
    "But I did not sneeze he murmured.",
    "So much for that.",
    "No I did not sneeze.",
    "6\nLennox Boynton came into the room with a quick resolute step.",
    "Had he been\nthere Dr. Gerard would have been surprised at the change in the man.",
    "The apathy\nwas gone.",
    "His bearing was alertalthough he was plainly nervous.",
    "His eyes had a\ntendency to shift rapidly from point to point about the room.",
    "Good morning M. Boynton.",
    "Poirot rose and bowed ceremoniously.",
    "Lennox\nresponded somewhat awkwardly.",
    "I much appreciate your giving me this interview.",
    "Lennox Boynton said rather uncertainly ErColonel Carbury said it would be\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 67\n\na good thing.",
    "Advised it.",
    "Some formalities he said.",
    "Please sit down M. Boynton.",
    "Lennox sat down on the chair lately vacated by Lady Westholme.",
    "Poirot went on conversationally This has been a great shock to you I am\nafraid.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "Well no perhaps not .",
    ". . We always knew that my mothers\nheart was not strong.",
    "Was it wise under those circumstances to allow her to undertake such an\narduous expedition\nLennox Boynton raised his head.",
    "He spoke not without a certain sad dignity.",
    "My mother M.er Poirot made her own decisions.",
    "If she had made up her mind to\nanything it was no good our opposing her.",
    "He drew in his breath sharply as he said\nthe last words.",
    "His face suddenly grew rather white.",
    "I know well admitted Poirot that elderly ladies are sometimes headstrong.",
    "Lennox said irritably What is the purpose of all this That is what I want to\nknow.",
    "Why have all these formalities arisen\nPerhaps you do not realize M. Boynton that in cases of sudden and\nunexplained deaths formalities must necessarily arise.",
    "Lennox said sharply What do you mean by unexplained\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "There is always the question to be\nconsidered Is a death natural or might it perhaps be suicide\nSuicide Lennox Boynton stared.",
    "Poirot said lightly You of course would know best about such possibilities.",
    "Colonel Carbury naturally is in the dark.",
    "It is necessary for him to decide whether to\norder an inquiryan autopsyall the rest of it.",
    "As I was on the spot and as I have much\nexperience of these matters he suggested that I should make a few inquiries and\nadvise him upon the matter.",
    "Naturally he does not wish to cause you inconvenience\nif it can be helped.",
    "Lennox Boynton said angrily I shall wire to our Consul in Jerusalem.",
    "Poirot said noncommittally You are quite within your rights in doing so of\ncourse.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Then Poirot said spreading out his hands If you\nobject to answering my questions\nLennox Boynton said quickly Not at all.",
    "Onlyit seemsall so unnecessary.",
    "I comprehend.",
    "I comprehend perfectly.",
    "But it is all very simple really.",
    "A\nmatter as they say of routine.",
    "Now on the afternoon of your mothers death M.\nBoynton I believe you left the camp at Petra and went for a walk\nYes.",
    "We all went with the exception of my mother and my younger sister.",
    "Your mother was then sitting in the mouth of her cave\nYes just outside it.",
    "She sat there every afternoon.",
    "Quite so.",
    "You startedwhen\nSoon after three I should say.",
    "You returned from your walkwhen\nI really couldnt say what time it wasfour oclockfive oclock perhaps.",
    "About an hour to two hours after you set out\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 68\n\nYesabout that I should think.",
    "Did you pass anyone on your way back\nDid I what\nPass anyone.",
    "Two ladies sitting on a rock for instance\nI dont know.",
    "Yes I think I did.",
    "You were perhaps too absorbed in your thoughts to notice\nYes I was.",
    "Did you speak to your mother when you got back to the camp\nYesyes I did.",
    "She did not then complain of feeling ill\nNono she seemed perfectly all right.",
    "May I ask what passed between you\nLennox paused a minute.",
    "She said I had come back soon.",
    "I said yes I had.",
    "He paused again in an effort of concentration.",
    "I said it was hot.",
    "Sheshe asked me\nthe timesaid her wristwatch had stopped.",
    "I took it from her wound it up set it and\nput it back on her wrist.",
    "Poirot interrupted gently And what time was it\nEh said Lennox.",
    "What time was it when you set the hands of the wristwatch\nOh I see.",
    "Itit was twentyfive minutes to five.",
    "So you do know exactly the time you returned to the camp said Poirot\ngently.",
    "Lennox flushed.",
    "Yes what a fool I am Im sorry M. Poirot my wits are all\nastray Im afraid.",
    "All this worry\nPoirot chimed in quickly Oh I understandI understand perfectly It is all of\nthe most disquieting And what happened next\nI asked my mother if she wanted anything.",
    "A drinktea coffee etc.. She said\nno.",
    "Then I went to the marquee.",
    "None of the servants seemed to be about but I\nfound some soda water and drank it.",
    "I was thirsty.",
    "I sat there reading some old\nnumbers of the Saturday Evening Post.",
    "I think I must have dozed off.",
    "Your wife joined you in the marquee\nYes she came in not long after.",
    "And you did not see your mother again alive\nNo.",
    "She did not seem in any way agitated or upset when you were talking to\nher\nNo she was exactly as usual.",
    "She did not refer to any trouble or annoyance with one of the servants\nLennox stared.",
    "No nothing at all.",
    "And that is all you can tell me\nI am afraid soyes.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 69\n\nThank you M. Boynton.",
    "Poirot inclined his head as a sign that the interview\nwas over.",
    "Lennox did not seem very willing to depart.",
    "He stood hesitating by the door.",
    "Ertheres nothing else\nNothing.",
    "Perhaps you would be so good as to ask your wife to come here\nLennox went slowly out.",
    "On the pad beside him Poirot wrote L. B.",
    "435 P.M.\n7\nPoirot looked with interest at the tall dignified young woman who entered the\nroom.",
    "He rose and bowed to her politely.",
    "Mrs. Lennox Boynton Hercule Poirot at your service.",
    "Nadine Boynton sat down.",
    "Her thoughtful eyes were on Poirots face.",
    "I hope you do not mind Madame my intruding on your sorrow in this way\nHer gaze did not waver.",
    "She did not reply at once.",
    "Her eyes remained steady\nand grave.",
    "At last she gave a sigh and said I think it is best for me to be quite frank\nwith you M. Poirot.",
    "I agree with you Madame.",
    "You apologized for intruding upon my sorrow.",
    "That sorrow M. Poirot does\nnot exist and it is idle to pretend that it does.",
    "I had no love for my motherinlaw and I\ncannot honestly say that I regret her death.",
    "Thank you Madame for your plain speaking.",
    "Nadine went on Still although I cannot pretend sorrow I can admit to\nanother feelingremorse.",
    "Remorse Poirots eyebrows went up.",
    "Yes.",
    "Because you see it was I who brought about her death.",
    "For that I\nblame myself bitterly.",
    "What is this that you are saying Madame\nI am saying that I was the cause of my motherinlaws death.",
    "I was acting as\nI thought honestlybut the result was unfortunate.",
    "To all intents and purposes I\nkilled her.",
    "Poirot leaned back in his chair.",
    "Will you be so kind as to elucidate this\nstatement Madame\nNadine bent her head.",
    "Yes that is what I wish to do.",
    "My first reaction\nnaturally was to keep my private affairs to myself but I see that the time has come\nwhen it would be better to speak out.",
    "I have no doubt M. Poirot that you have often\nreceived confidences of a somewhat intimate nature\nThat yes.",
    "Then I will tell you quite simply what occurred.",
    "My married life M. Poirot has\nnot been particularly happy.",
    "My husband is not entirely to blame for thathis mothers\ninfluence over him has been unfortunatebut I have been feeling for some time that\nmy life was becoming intolerable\nShe paused and then went on On the afternoon of my motherinlaws death\nI came to a decision.",
    "I have a frienda very good friend.",
    "He has suggested more than\nonce that I should throw in my lot with his.",
    "On that afternoon I accepted his\nproposal.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 70\n\nYou decided to leave your husband\nYes.",
    "Continue Madame.",
    "Nadine said in a lower voice Having once made my decision I wanted toto\nestablish it as soon as possible.",
    "I walked home to the camp by myself.",
    "My motherinlaw was sitting alone there was one about and I decided to break the news to her\nright there.",
    "I got a chair sat down by her and told her abruptly what I had decided.",
    "She was surprised\nYes I am afraid it was a great shock to her.",
    "She was both surprised and\nangryvery angry.",
    "Sheshe worked herself into quite a state about it Presently I\nrefused to discuss the matter any longer.",
    "I got up and walked away.",
    "Her voice\ndropped.",
    "II never saw her again alive.",
    "Poirot nodded his head slowly.",
    "He said I see.",
    "Then he said You think her\ndeath was the result of the shock\nIt seems to me almost certain.",
    "You see she had already overexerted herself\nconsiderably getting to this place.",
    "My news and her anger at it would do the rest. . .\n.",
    "I feel additionally guilty because I have had a certain amount of training in illness\nand so I more than anyone else ought to have realized the possibility of such a\nthing happening.",
    "Poirot sat in silence for some minutes then he said What exactly did you do\nwhen you left her\nI took the chair I had brought out back into my cave then I went down to the\nmarquee.",
    "My husband was there.",
    "Poirot watched her closely as he said Did you tell him of your decision Or\nhad you already told him\nThere was a pause an infinitesimal pause before Nadine said I told him\nthen.",
    "How did he take it\nShe answered quietly He was very upset.",
    "Did he urge you to reconsider your decision\nShe shook her head.",
    "Hehe didnt say very much.",
    "You see we had both\nknown for some time that something like this might happen.",
    "Poirot said You will pardon me but the other man was of course M.\nJefferson Cope\nShe bent her head.",
    "Yes.",
    "There was a long pause then without any change of voice Poirot asked Do\nyou own a hypodermic syringe Madame\nYesno.",
    "His eyebrows rose.",
    "She explained.",
    "I have an old hypodermic amongst other things in a traveling\nmedicine chest but it is in our big luggage which we left in Jerusalem.",
    "I see.",
    "There was a pause then she said with a shiver of uneasiness Why did you\nask me that M. Poirot\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 71\n\nHe did not answer the question.",
    "Instead he put one of his own.",
    "Mrs. Boynton\nwas I believe taking a mixture containing digitalis\nYes.",
    "He thought that she was definitely watchful now.",
    "That was for her heart\ntrouble\nYes.",
    "Digitalis is to some extent a cumulative drug\nI believe it is.",
    "I do not know very much about it.",
    "Mrs. Boynton had taken a big overdose of digitalis\nShe interrupted him quickly but with decision.",
    "She did not.",
    "She was always\nmost careful.",
    "So was I if I measured the dose for her.",
    "There might have been an overdose in this particular bottle.",
    "A mistake of the\nchemist who made it up\nI think that is very unlikely she replied quietly.",
    "Ah well the analysis will soon tell us.",
    "Nadine said Unfortunately the bottle was broken.",
    "Poirot eyed her with sudden interest.",
    "Indeed Who broke it\nIm not quite sure.",
    "One of the servants I think.",
    "In carrying my motherinlaws\nbody into her cave there was a good deal of confusion and the light was very poor.",
    "A table got knocked over.",
    "Poirot eyed her steadily for a minute or two.",
    "That he said is very\ninteresting.",
    "Nadine Boynton shifted wearily in her chair.",
    "You are suggesting I think that\nmy motherinlaw did not die of shock but of an overdose of digitalis she said and\nwent on That seems to me most improbable.",
    "Poirot leaned forward.",
    "Even when I tell you that Dr. Gerard the French\nphysician who was staying in the camp had missed an appreciable quantity of a\npreparation of digitoxin from his medicine chest\nHer face grew very pale.",
    "He saw the clutch of her other hand on the table.",
    "Her\neyes dropped.",
    "She sat very still.",
    "She was like a Madonna carved in stone.",
    "Well Madame said Poirot at last.",
    "What have you say to that\nThe seconds ticked on but she did not speak.",
    "It was quite two minutes before\nshe raised her head and he started a little when he saw the look in her eyes.",
    "M. Poirot I did not kill my motherinlaw.",
    "That you know She was alive and\nwell when I left her.",
    "There are many people who can testify to that Therefore being\ninnocent of the crime I can venture to appeal to you.",
    "Why must you mix yourself up\nin this business If I swear to you on my honor that justice and only justice has been\ndone.",
    "Will you not abandon this inquiry There has been so much sufferingyou do\nnot know.",
    "Now that at last there is peace and the possibility of happiness must you\ndestroy it all\nPoirot sat up very straight.",
    "His eyes shone with a green light.",
    "Let me be\nclear Madame.",
    "What are you asking me to do\nI am telling you that my motherinlaw died a natural death and I am asking\nyou to accept that statement.",
    "Let us be definite.",
    "You believe that your motherinlaw was deliberately killed\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 72\n\nand you are asking me to condonemurder\nI am asking you to have pity\nYeson someone who had no pity\nYou dont understandit was not like that.",
    "Did you commit the crime yourself Madame that you know so well\nNadine shook her head.",
    "She showed no signs of guilt.",
    "No she said quietly.",
    "She was alive when I left her.",
    "Then what happened You knowor you suspect\nNadine said passionately I have heard M. Poirot that once in that affair of\nthe Orient Express you accepted an official verdict of what had happened\nPoirot looked at her curiously.",
    "I wonder who told you that.",
    "Is it true\nHe said slowly That case wasdifferent.",
    "No.",
    "No it was not different The man who was killed was evil her voice\ndropped as she was. . . .\nPoirot said The moral character of the victim has nothing to do with it A\nhuman being who has exercised the right of private judgment and taken the life of\nanother human being is not safe to exist amongst the community.",
    "I tell you that I\nHercule Poirot\nHow hard you are\nMadame in some ways I am adamant.",
    "I will not condone murder That is the\nfinal word of Hercule Poirot.",
    "She got up.",
    "Her dark eyes flashed with sudden fire.",
    "Then go on Bring ruin\nand misery into the lives of innocent people I have nothing more to say.",
    "But II think Madame that you have a lot to say.",
    "No nothing more.",
    "What happened Madame after you left your motherinlaw Whilst you and\nyour husband were in the marquee together\nShe shrugged her shoulders.",
    "How should I know\nYou do knowor you suspect.",
    "She looked him straight in the eyes.",
    "I know nothing M. Poirot.",
    "Turning she\nleft the room.",
    "8\nAfter noting on his pad N. B.",
    "440 Poirot opened the door and called to the\norderly whom Colonel Carbury had left at his disposal an intelligent man with a good\nknowledge of English.",
    "He asked him to fetch Miss Carol Boynton.",
    "Poirot looked with some interest at the girl as she entered at the chestnut\nhair the poise of the head on the long neck the nervous energy of the beautifully\nshaped hands.",
    "He said Sit down Mademoiselle.",
    "She sat down obediently.",

    "All I want is your happiness.",
    "Thats all Ive ever\nwanted.",
    "Seeing you unhappy has very nearly driven me crazy.",
    "And I may say that\nIve blamed Lennox.",
    "Ive felt that he didnt deserve to keep you if he didnt value your\nhappiness a little more than he seemed to do.",
    "Mr.",
    "Cope took a breath and went on Now Ill admit that after traveling with\nyou to Petra I felt that perhaps Lennox wasnt quite so much to blame as I thought.",
    "He wasnt so much selfish where you were concerned as too unselfish where his\nmother was concerned.",
    "I dont want to say anything against the dead but I do think\nthat your motherinlaw was perhaps an unusually difficult woman.",
    "Yes I think you may say that murmured Nadine.",
    "Anyway went on Mr.",
    "Cope you came to me yesterday and told me that\nyoud definitely decided to leave Lennox.",
    "I applauded your decision.",
    "It wasnt rightthe life you were leading.",
    "You were quite honest with me.",
    "You didnt pretend to be\nmore than just mildly fond of me.",
    "Well that was all right with me.",

    "Nadine cried out Im sorryIm sorry.",
    "No my dear because all along I had a kind of feeling that it wasnt real.",
    "I felt\nit was quite on the cards that you would have changed your mind by the next\nmorning.",
    "Well things are different now.",
    "You and Lennox can lead a life of your own.",

    "I cant leave Lennox.",

    "Nadine.",
    "He half turned.",
    "She said We havent been able to talk until now.",
    "But you know dont you\nthat I am not leaving you\nHe said gravely Did you ever really mean to Nadine\nShe nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "You see it seemed to be the only possible thing left to do.",
    "I hopedI hoped that you would come after me.",
    "Poor Jefferson how mean I have\nbeen to him.",
    "Lennox gave a sudden curt laugh.",
    "No you havent.",
    "Anyone who is as\nunselfish as Cope ought to be given full scope for his nobility And you were right\nyou know Nadine.",
    "When you told me that you were going away with him you gave\nme the shock of my life.",
    "You know honestly I think I must have been going queer or\nsomething lately.",
    "Why the hell didnt I snap my fingers in Mothers face and go off\nwith you when you wanted me to\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 87\n\nShe said gently You couldnt my dear you couldnt.",
    "Lennox said musingly Mother was a damned queer character. . . .",
    "I believe\nshed got us all half hypnotized.",
    "She had.",
    "Lennox mused a minute or two longer.",
    "Then he said When you told me that\nafternoonit was just like being hit a crack on the head I walked back half dazed and\nthen suddenly I saw what a damned fool Id been I realized that there was only one\nthing to be done if I didnt want to lose you.",
    "He felt her stiffen.",
    "His tone became grimmer.",
    "I went and\nDont .",
    ". .",
    "He gave her a quick glance.",
    "I went and argued with her.",
    "He spoke with a\ncomplete change of tonecareful and rather toneless.",
    "I told her that Id got to choose\nbetween her and youand that I chose you.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "He repeated in a tone of curious selfapproval Yes\nthats what I said to her.",

    "The first was Mr. Jefferson Cope.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot My names Jefferson Cope.",
    "The two men shook hands ceremoniously.",
    "Then falling into step beside\nPoirot Mr.",
    "Cope explained Its just got around to me that youre making a kind of\nroutine inquiry into the death of my old friend Mrs. Boynton.",
    "That certainly was a\nshocking business.",
    "Of course mind you the old lady ought never to have\nundertaken such a fatiguing journey.",
    "But she was headstrong M. Poirot.",
    "Her family\ncould do nothing with her.",
    "She was by way of being a household tyranthad had her\nown way too long I guess.",
    "It certainly is true that what she said went Yes sir that\ncertainly was true.",
    "There was a momentary pause.",
    "Id just like to tell you M. Poirot that Im an old friend of the Boynton family.",
    "Naturally theyre all a good deal upset over this business theyre a trifle nervous and\nhighly strung too you know so if there are any arrangements to be made necessary\nformalities arrangements for the funeral transport of the body to Jerusalem why Ill\ntake as much trouble as I can on their hands.",
    "Just call upon me for anything that\nneeds doing.",
    "I am sure the family will appreciate your offer said Poirot.",
    "He added You\nare I think a special friend of young Mrs. Boyntons.",
    "Mr. Jefferson Cope went a little pink.",
    "Well.",
    "We wont say much about that M.\nPoirot.",
    "I hear you had an interview with Mrs. Lennox Boynton this morning and she\nmay have given you a hint how things were between us but thats all over now.",
    "Mrs.\nBoynton is a very fine woman and she feels that her first duty is to her husband in his\nsad bereavement.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Poirot received the information by a delicate gesture of\nthe head.",
    "Then he murmured It is the desire of Colonel Carbury to have a clear\nstatement concerning the afternoon of Mrs. Boyntons death.",
    "Can you give me an\naccount of that afternoon\nWhy certainly.",
    "After our luncheon and a brief rest we set out for a kind of\ninformal tour around.",
    "We escaped Im glad to say without that pestilential\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 88\n\ndragoman.",
    "That mans just crazy on the subject of the Jews.",
    "I dont think hes quite\nsane on that point.",
    "Anyway as I was saying we set out.",
    "It was then that I had my\ninterview with Nadine.",
    "Afterwards she wished to be alone with her husband to\ndiscuss matters with him.",
    "I went off on my own working gradually back towards the\ncamp.",
    "About half way there I met the two English ladies who had been on the\nmorning expedition.",
    "One of thems an English peeress I understand.",
    "Poirot said that such was the case.",
    "Ah shes a fine woman a very powerful intellect and very well informed.",
    "The\nother seemed to me rather a weak sister and she looked about dead with fatigue.",
    "That expedition in the morning was very strenuous for an elderly lady especially\nwhen she doesnt like heights.",
    "Well as I was saying I met these two ladies and was\nable to give them some information on the subject of the Nabateans.",
    "We went\naround a bit and got back to the camp about six.",
    "Lady Westholme insisted on having\ntea and I had the pleasure of having a cup with her.",
    "The tea was kind of weak but it\nhad an interesting flavor.",
    "Then the boys laid the table for supper and sent out for the\nold lady only to find that she was sitting there dead in her chair.",
    "Did you notice her as you walked home\nI did just notice she was thereit was her usual seat in the afternoon and\nevening but I didnt pay special attention.",
    "I was just explaining to Lady Westholme\nthe conditions of our recent slump.",
    "I had to keep an eye on Miss Pierce too.",
    "She\nwas so tired she kept turning her ankles.",
    "Thank you Mr.",
    "Cope.",
    "May I be so indiscreet as to ask if Mrs. Boynton is\nlikely to have left a large fortune\nA very considerable one.",
    "That is to say strictly speaking it was not hers to\nleave.",
    "She had a life interest in it and at her death it is divided among the late Elmer\nBoyntons children.",
    "Yes they will all be very comfortably off now.",
    "Money murmured Poirot makes a lot of difference.",
    "How many crimes have\nbeen committed for it\nMr.",
    "Cope looked a little startled.",
    "Why thats so I suppose he admitted.",
    "Poirot smiled sweetly and murmured But there are so many motives for\nmurder are there not Thank you Mr.",
    "Cope for your kind cooperation.",
    "Youre welcome Im sure said Mr.",
    "Cope.",
    "Do I see Miss King sitting up\nthere I think Ill go and have a word with her.",
    "Poirot continued to descend the hill.",
    "He met Miss Pierce fluttering up it.",
    "She\ngreeted him breathlessly.",
    "Oh M. Poirot Im so glad to meet you.",
    "Ive been talking to that very odd\nBoynton girlthe youngest one you know.",
    "She has been saying the strangest thingsabout enemies and some Sheikh who wanted to kidnap her and how she has spies\nall around her.",
    "Really it sounded most romantic Lady Westholme says it is all\nnonsense and that she once had a redheaded kitchen maid who told lies just like\nthat but I think sometimes that Lady Westholme is rather hard.",
    "And after all it might\nbe true mightnt it M. Poirot I read some years ago that one of the Czars\ndaughters was not killed in the Revolution in Russia but escaped secretly to\nAmerica.",
    "The Grand Duchess Tatiana I think it was.",
    "If so this might be her\ndaughter mightnt it She did hint at something Royal.",
    "And she has a look dont you\nthink Rather Slavic those cheekbones.",
    "How thrilling it would be\nMiss Pierce looked wistful and excited.",
    "Poirot said somewhat sententiously\nIt is true that there are many strange things in life.",
    "I didnt really take in this morning who you are said Miss Pierce clasping\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 89\n\nher hands.",
    "Of course you are that very famous detective I read all about the A.B.C.",
    "case.",
    "It was so thrilling.",
    "I had actually a post as governess near Doncaster at the\ntime.",
    "Poirot murmured something.",
    "Miss Pierce went on with growing agitation\nThat is why I felt that perhaps I had been wrong this morning.",
    "One must always tell\neverything must one of even the smallest detail however unrelated it may seem.",
    "Because of course if you are mixed up in this poor Mrs. Boynton must have been\nmurdered I see that now.",
    "I suppose Mr. Mah MoodI cannot remember his namebut\nthe dragoman I meanI suppose he could not be a Bolshevik agent Or even\nperhaps Miss Kings I believe many quite well brought up young girls of good family\nbelong to these dreadful Communists Thats why I wondered if I ought to tell youbecause you see it was rather peculiar when one comes to think of it.",
    "Precisely said Poirot.",
    "And therefore you will tell me all about it.",
    "Well its not really anything very much.",
    "Its only that on the next morning after\nMrs. Boyntons death I was up rather early and I looked out of my tent to see the\neffect of the sunrise you know.",
    "Only of course it wasnt actually sunrise because the\nsun must have risen quite an hour before.",
    "But it was early\nYes yes.",
    "And you saw\nThats the curious thingat least at the time it didnt seem much.",
    "It was only\nthat I saw that Boynton girl come out of her tent and fling something right out into the\nstream.",
    "Nothing in that of course but it glittered in the sunlight As it went through\nthe air.",
    "It glittered you know.",
    "Which Boynton girl was it\nI think it was the one they call Carola very nicelooking girlso like her\nbrother.",
    "Really they might be twins.",
    "Or of course it might have been the youngest\none.",
    "The sun was in my eyes so I couldnt quite see.",
    "But I dont think the hair was\nredjust bronze.",
    "Im so fond or that coppery bronze hair Red hair always says\ncarrots to me She tittered.",
    "And she threw away a brightly glittering object said Poirot.",
    "Yes.",
    "And of course as I said I didnt think much of it at the time.",
    "But later I\nhad walked along the stream and Miss King was there.",
    "And there amongst a lot of\nother very unsuitable thingseven a tin or twoI saw a little bright metal box.",
    "Not an\nexact square.",
    "A sort of long square if you understand what I mean\nBut yes I understand perfectly.",
    "About so long\nYes how clever of you And I thought to myself I suppose thats what the\nBoynton girl threw away but its a nice little box.",
    "And just out of curiosity I picked it\nup and opened it.",
    "It had a kind of syringe insidethe same thing they stuck into my\narm when I was being inoculated for typhoid.",
    "And I thought how curious to throw it\naway like that because it didnt seem broken or anything.",
    "But just as I was wondering\nMiss King spoke behind me.",
    "I hadnt heard her come up.",
    "And she said Oh thank\nyouthats my hypodermic.",
    "I was coming to look for it.",
    "So I gave it to her and she\nwent back to the camp with it.",
    "Miss Pierce paused and then went on hurriedly And of course I expect\nthere is nothing in itonly it did seem a little curious that Carol Boynton should throw\naway Miss Kings syringe.",
    "I mean it was odd if you know what I mean.",
    "Though of\ncourse I expect there is a very good explanation.",
    "She paused looking expectantly at Poirot.",
    "His face was grave.",
    "Thank you Mademoiselle.",
    "What you have told me may\nnot be important in itself but I will tell you this It completes my case Everything is\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 90\n\nnow clear and in order.",
    "Oh really Miss Pierce looked as flushed and pleased as a child.",
    "Poirot escorted her to the hotel.",
    "Back in his own room he added one line to his memorandum\nPoint No.",
    "10.",
    "I never forget.",
    "Remember that Ive never forgotten anything. . .\n.",
    "He nodded his head.",
    "Mais oui he said.",
    "It is all clear now\n15\nMy preparations are complete said Hercule Poirot.",
    "With a little sigh he\nstepped back a pace or two and contemplated his arrangement of one of the\nunoccupied hotel bedrooms.",
    "Colonel Carbury leaning inelegantly against the bed which had been pushed\nagainst the wall smiled as he puffed at his pipe.",
    "Funny feller arent you Poirot he said.",
    "Like to dramatize things.",
    "Perhaps that is true admitted the little detective.",
    "But indeed it is not all\nselfindulgence.",
    "If one plays a comedy one must first set the scene.",
    "Is this a comedy\nEven if it is a tragedythere too the decor must be correct.",
    "Colonel Carbury looked at him curiously.",
    "Well he said.",
    "Its up to you I dont\nknow what youre driving at.",
    "I gather though that youve got something.",
    "I shall have the honor to present to you what you asked me forthe truth\nDo you think we can get a conviction\nThat my friend I did not promise you.",
    "True enough.",
    "Maybe Im glad you havent.",
    "It depends.",
    "My arguments are mainly psychological said Poirot.",
    "Colonel Carburv sighed.",
    "I was afraid they might be.",
    "But they will convince you Poirot reassured him.",
    "Oh yes they will\nconvince you.",
    "The truth I have always thought is curious and beautiful.",
    "Sometimes said Colonel Carbury its damned unpleasant.",
    "No no.",
    "Poirot was earnest.",
    "You take there the personal view.",
    "Take instead\nthe abstract the detached point of vision.",
    "Then the absolute logic of events is\nfascinating and orderly.",
    "Ill try and look on it that way said the Colonel.",
    "Poirot glanced at his watch a large grotesque turnip of a watch.",
    "Family heirloom inquired Carbury interestedly.",
    "But yes indeed it belonged to my grandfather.",
    "Thought it might have done.",
    "It is time to commence our proceedings said Poirot.",
    "You mon Colonel will\nsit here behind this table in an official position.",
    "Oh all right Carbury grunted.",
    "You dont want me to put my uniform on do\nyou\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 91\n\nNo no.",
    "If you would permit that I straightened your tie.",
    "He suited the action to the word.",
    "Colonel Carbury grinned again sat down in\nthe chair indicated and a moment later unconsciously tweaked his tie around under\nhis left ear again.",
    "Here continued Poirot slightly altering the position of the chairs we place\nla famille Boynton.",
    "And over here he went on we will place the three outsiders\nwho have a definite stake in the case.",
    "Dr. Gerard on whose evidence the case for\nthe prosecution depends.",
    "Miss Sarah King who has two separate interests in the\ncase a personal one and that of medical examiner.",
    "Also M. Jefferson Cope who\nwas on intimate terms with the Boyntons and so may be definitely described as an\ninterested party.",
    "He broke off.",
    "Ahahere they come.",
    "He opened the door to admit the party.",
    "Lennox Boynton and his wife came in first.",
    "Raymond and Carol followed.",
    "Ginevra walked by herself a faint faraway smile on her lips.",
    "Dr. Gerard and Sarah\nKing brought up the rear.",
    "Mr. Jefferson Cope was a few minutes late and came in\nwith an apology.",
    "When he had taken his place Poirot stepped forward.",
    "Ladies and gentlemen he said this is an entirely informal gathering.",
    "It has\ncome about through the accident of my presence in Amman.",
    "Colonel Carbury did me\nthe honor to consult me\nPoirot was interrupted.",
    "The interruption came from what was seemingly the\nmost unlikely quarter.",
    "Lennox Boynton said suddenly and pugnaciously Why Why\nthe devil should he bring you into this business\nPoirot waved a hand gracefully.",
    "Me I am often called in cases of sudden\ndeath.",
    "Lennox Boynton said Doctors send for you whenever there is a case of heart\nfailure\nPoirot said gently Heart failure is such a very loose and unscientific term.",
    "Colonel Carbury cleared his throat.",
    "It was an official noise.",
    "He spoke in an\nofficial tone Best to make it quite clear.",
    "Circumstances of death reported to me.",
    "Very natural occurrence.",
    "Weather unusually hot.",
    "Journey a very trying one for an\nelderly lady in bad health.",
    "So far all quite clear.",
    "But Dr. Gerard came to me and\nvolunteered a statement He looked inquiringly at Poirot.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Dr. Gerard is a very eminent physician with a worldwide reputation.",
    "Any\nstatement he makes is bound to be received with attention.",
    "Dr. Gerards statement\nwas as follows On the morning after Mrs. Boyntons death he noticed that a certain\nquantity of a powerful drug acting on the heart was missing from his medical\nsupplies.",
    "On the previous afternoon he had noted the disappearance of a\nhypodermic syringe.",
    "Syringe was returned during the night.",
    "Final pointthere was a\npuncture on the dead womans wrist corresponding to the mark of a hypodermic\nsyringe.",
    "Colonel Carbury paused.",
    "In these circumstances I considered that it was the\nduty of those in authority to inquire into the matter.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot was my guest\nand very considerately offered his highly specialized services.",
    "I gave him full\nauthority to make any investigations he pleased.",
    "We are assembled here now to\nhear his report on the matter.",
    "There was silence.",
    "A silence so acute that you could have heardas the\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 92\n\nsaying isa pin drop.",
    "Actually somebody in the next room did drop what was\nprobably a shoe.",
    "It sounded like a bomb in the hushed atmosphere.",
    "Poirot cast a quick glance at the little group of three people on his right then\nturned his gaze to the five people huddled together on his lefta group of people with\nfrightened eyes.",
    "Poirot said quietly When Colonel Carbury mentioned this business to me I\ngave him my opinion as an expert.",
    "I told him that it might not be possible to bring\nproofsuch proof as would be admissible in a court of lawbut I told him very\ndefinitely that I was sure I could arrive at the truth simply by questioning the people\nconcerned.",
    "For let me tell you this my friends to investigate a crime it is only\nnecessary to let the guilty party or parties talk.",
    "Always in the end they tell you what\nyou want to know\nHe paused.",
    "So in this case although you have lied to me you have also\nunwittingly told me the truth.",
    "He heard a faint sigh the scrape of a chair on the floor to his right but he did\nnot look around.",
    "He continued to look at the Boyntons.",
    "First I examined the possibility of Mrs. Boyntons having died a natural\ndeathand I decided against it.",
    "The missing drug the hypodermic syringe and above\nall the attitude of the dead ladys family all convinced me that that supposition could\nnot be entertained.",
    "Not only was Mrs. Boynton killed in cold bloodbut every member\nof her family was aware of the fact Collectively they reacted as guilty parties.",
    "But there are degrees in guilt.",
    "I examined the evidence carefully with a view\nto ascertaining whether the murderyes it was murderhad been committed by the\nold ladys family acting on a concerted plan.",
    "There was I may say overwhelming\nmotive.",
    "One and all stood to gain by her deathboth in the financial sensefor they\nwould at once attain financial independence and indeed enjoy very considerable\nwealthand also in the sense of being freed from what had become an almost\ninsupportable tyranny.",
    "To continue I decided almost immediately that the concerted theory would\nnot hold water.",
    "The stories of the Boynton family did not dovetail neatly into each\nother and no system of workable alibis had been arranged.",
    "The facts seemed more\nto suggest that oneor possibly two members of the family had acted in collusion and\nthat the others were accessories after the fact.",
    "I next considered which particular member or members were indicated.",
    "Here\nI may say I was inclined to be biased by a certain piece of evidence known only to\nmyself.",
    "Here Poirot recounted his experience in Jerusalem.",
    "Naturally that pointed very strongly to M. Raymond Boynton as the prime\nmover in the affair.",
    "Studying the family I came to the conclusion that the most likely\nrecipient of his confidences that night would be his sister Carol.",
    "They strongly\nresembled each other in appearance and temperament and so would have a keen\nbond of sympathy and they also possessed the nervous rebellious temperament\nnecessary for the conception of such an act.",
    "That their motives were partly unselfishto free the whole family and particularly their younger sisteronly made the planning\nof the deed more plausible.",
    "Poirot paused a minute.",
    "Raymond Boynton half opened his lips then shut them again.",
    "His eyes looked\nsteadily at Poirot with a kind of dumb agony in them.",
    "Before I go into the case against Raymond Boynton I would like to read to\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 93\n\nyou a list of significant points which I drew up and submitted to Colonel Carbury this\nafternoon\nSIGNIFICANT POINTS\n1.",
    "Mrs. Boynton was taking a mixture containing digitalis.",
    "2.",
    "Dr. Gerard missed a hypodermic syringe.",
    "3.",
    "Mrs. Boynton took definite pleasure in keeping her family from enjoying\nthemselves with other people.",
    "4.",
    "Mrs. Boynton on the afternoon in question encouraged her family to go\naway and leave her.",
    "5.",
    "Mrs. Boynton was a mental sadist.",
    "6.",
    "The distance from the marquee to the place where Mrs. Boynton was sitting\nis roughly two hundred yards.",
    "7.",
    "M. Lennox Boynton said at first he did not know what time he returned to\nthe camp but later he admitted having set his mothers wristwatch to the right time.",
    "8.",
    "Dr. Gerard and Miss Ginevra Boynton occupied tents next door to each\nother.",
    "9.",
    "At halfpast six when dinner was ready a servant was dispatched to\nannounce the fact to Mrs. Boynton.",
    "10.",
    "Mrs. Boynton in Jerusalem used these words I never forget.",
    "Remember\nthat.",
    "Ive never forgotten anything.",
    "Although I have numbered the points separately occasionally they can be\nbracketed in pairs.",
    "That is the case for instance with the first two.",
    "Mrs. Boynton was\ntaking a mixture containing digitalis.",
    "Dr. Gerard had missed a hypodermic syringe.",
    "Those two points were the first thing that struck me about the case and I may say to\nyou that I found them most extraordinaryand quite irreconcilable.",
    "You do not see\nwhat I mean No matter.",
    "I will return to the point presently.",
    "Let it suffice that I noted\nthose two points as something that had definitely got to be explained satisfactorily.",
    "I will conclude now with my study of the possibility of Raymond Boyntons\nguilt.",
    "The following are the facts He had been heard to discuss the possibility of\ntaking Mrs. Boyntons life.",
    "He was in a condition of great nervous excitement.",
    "He\nhadMademoiselle will forgive mehe bowed apologetically to Sarahjust passed\nthrough a moment of great emotional crisis.",
    "That is he had fallen in love.",
    "The\nexaltation of his feelings might lead him to act in one of several ways.",
    "He might feel\nmellowed and softened towards the world in general including his stepmother he\nmight feel the courage at last to defy her and shake off her influence or he might find\njust the additional spur to turn his crime from theory to practice.",
    "That is the\npsychology Let us now examine the facts.",
    "Raymond Boynton left the camp with the others about threefifteen.",
    "Mrs.\nBoynton was then alive and well.",
    "Before long Raymond and Sarah King had a t\u00eate\u00e0t\u00eate interview.",
    "Then he left her.",
    "According to him he returned to the camp at ten\nminutes to six.",
    "He went up to his mother exchanged a few words with her then went\nto his tent and afterwards down to the marquee.",
    "He says that at ten minutes to six\nMrs. Boynton was alive and well.",
    "But we now come to a fact which directly contradicts that statement.",
    "At halfpast six Mrs. Boyntons death was discovered by a servant.",
    "Miss King who holds a\nmedical degree examined her body and she swears definitely that at that time\nthough she did not pay any special attention to the time when death had occurred it\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 94\n\nhad most certainly and decisively taken place at least an hour and probably a good\ndeal more before six oclock.",
    "We have here you see two conflicting statements.",
    "Setting aside the\npossibility that Miss King may have made a mistake\nSarah interrupted him.",
    "I dont make mistakes.",
    "That is if I had I would admit\nto it.",
    "Her tone was hard and clear.",
    "Poirot bowed to her politely.",
    "Then there are only two possibilitieseither Miss King or M. Boynton is lying\nLet us examine Raymond Boyntons reasons for so doing.",
    "Let us assume that Miss\nKing was not mistaken and not deliberately lying.",
    "What then was the sequence of\nevents Raymond Boynton returns to the camp sees his mother sitting at the mouth\nof her cave goes up to her and finds she is dead.",
    "What does he do Does he call for\nhelp Does he immediately inform the camp of what has happened No he waits a\nminute or two then passes on to his tent and joins his family in the marquee and\nsays nothing.",
    "Such conduct is exceedingly curious is it not\nRaymond said in a nervous sharp voice It would be idiotic of course.",
    "That\nought to show you that my mother was alive and well as Ive said.",
    "Miss King was\nflustered and upset and made a mistake.",
    "One asks oneself said Poirot calmly sweeping on whether there could\npossibly be a reason for such conduct It seems on the face of it that Raymond\nBoynton cannot be guilty since at the only time he was known to approach his\nstepmother that afternoon she had already been dead for some time.",
    "Now\nsupposing therefore that Raymond Boynton is innocent can we explain his\nconduct\nAnd I say that on the assumption that he is innocent we can For I remember\nthat fragment of conversation I overheard.",
    "You do see dont you that shes got to\nbe killed He comes back from his walk and finds her dead and at once his guilty\nmemory envisages a certain possibility.",
    "The plan has been carried out not by him\nbut by his fellow planner.",
    "Tout simplement he suspects that his sister Carol\nBoynton is guilty.",
    "Its a lie said Raymond in a low trembling voice.",
    "Poirot went on Let us now take the possibility of Carol Boynton being the\nmurderess.",
    "What is the evidence against her She has the same highlystrung\ntemperamentthe kind of temperament that might see such a deed colored with\nheroism.",
    "It was she to whom Raymond Boynton was talking that night in Jerusalem.",
    "Carol Boynton returned to the camp at ten minutes past five.",
    "According to her own\nstory she went up and spoke to her mother.",
    "No one saw her do so.",
    "The camp was\ndesertedthe boys were asleep.",
    "Lady Westholme Miss Pierce and M. Cope were\nexploring caves out of sight of the camp.",
    "There was no witness to Carol Boyntons\npossible action.",
    "The time would agree well enough.",
    "The case then against Carol\nBoynton is a perfectly possible one.",
    "He paused.",
    "Carol had raised her head.",
    "Her eyes looked steadily and\nsorrowfully into his.",
    "There is one other point.",
    "The following morning very early Carol Boynton\nwas seen to throw something into the stream.",
    "There is reason to believe that that\nsomething was a hypodermic syringe.",
    "Comment Dr. Gerard looked up surprised.",
    "But my hypodermic was\nreturned.",
    "Yes yes I have it now.",
    "Poirot nodded vigorously.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 95\n\nYes yes.",
    "This second hypodermic it is very curiousvery interesting.",
    "I have\nbeen given to understand that this hypodermic belonged to Miss King.",
    "Is that so\nSarah paused for a fraction of a second.",
    "Carol spoke quickly It was not Miss Kings syringe she said.",
    "It was mine.",
    "Then you admit throwing it away Mademoiselle\nShe hesitated just a second.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "Why shouldnt I\nCarol It was Nadine.",
    "She leaned forward her eyes wide and distressed.",
    "Carol.",
    ". . Oh I dont understand. . . .\nCarol turned and looked at her.",
    "There was something hostile in her glance.",
    "Theres nothing to understand I threw away an old hypodermic.",
    "I never touched\nthethe poison.",
    "Sarahs voice broke in.",
    "It is quite true what Miss Pierce told you M. Poirot.",
    "It\nwas my syringe.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "It is very confusing this affair of the hypodermicand yet I think it could be\nexplained.",
    "Ah well we have now two cases made outthe case for the innocence of\nRaymond Boyntonthe case for the guilt of his sister Carol.",
    "But me I am\nscrupulously fair.",
    "I look always on both sides.",
    "Let us examine what occurred if Carol\nBoynton was innocent.",
    "She returns to the camp she goes up to her stepmother and she finds hershall we saydead What is the first thing she will think She will suspect that her\nbrother Raymond may have killed her.",
    "She does not know what to do.",
    "So she says\nnothing.",
    "And presently about an hour later Raymond Boynton returns and having\npresumably spoken to his mother says nothing of anything being amiss.",
    "Do you not\nthink that then her suspicions would become certainties Perhaps she goes to his\ntent and finds there a hypodermic syringe.",
    "Then indeed she is sure She takes it\nquickly and hides it.",
    "Early in the morning she flings it as far away as she can.",
    "There is one more indication that Carol Boynton is innocent.",
    "She assures\nme when I question her that she and her brother never seriously intended to carry\nout their plan.",
    "I ask her to swearand she swears immediately and with the utmost\nsolemnity that she is not guilty of the crime You see that is the way she puts it.",
    "She\ndoes not swear that they are not guilty.",
    "She swears for herself not her brotherand\nthinks that I will not pay special attention to the pronoun.",
    "Eh bien that is the case for the innocence of Carol Boynton.",
    "And now let us\ngo back a step and consider not the innocence but the possible guilt of Raymond.",
    "Let us suppose that Carol is speaking the truth that Mrs. Boynton was alive at fiveten.",
    "Under what circumstances can Raymond be guilty We can suppose that he\nkilled his mother at ten minutes to six when he went up to speak to her.",
    "There were\nboys about the camp true but the light was failing.",
    "It might have been managed but\nit then follows that Miss King lied.",
    "Remember she came back to the camp only five\nminutes after Raymond.",
    "From the distance she would see him go up to his mother.",
    "Then when later she is found dead Miss King realizes that Raymond has killed her.",
    "To save him she liesknowing that Dr. Gerard is down with fever and cannot expose\nher lie\nI did not lie said Sarah clearly.",
    "There is yet another possibility.",
    "Miss King as I have said reached the camp\na few minutes after Raymond.",
    "If Raymond Boynton found his mother alive it may\nhave been Miss King who administered the fatal injection.",
    "She believed that Mrs.\nBoynton was fundamentally evil.",
    "She may have seen herself as a just executioner.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 96\n\nThat would equally well explain her lying about the time of death.",
    "Sarah had grown very pale.",
    "She spoke in a low steady voice It is true that I\nspoke of the expediency of one person dying to save many.",
    "It was the Place of\nSacrifice that suggested the idea to me.",
    "But I can swear to you that I never harmed\nthat disgusting old womannor would the idea of doing so ever have entered my\nhead\nAnd yet said Poirot softly one of you two must be lying.",
    "Raymond Boynton shifted in his chair.",
    "He cried out impetuously You win M.\nPoirot Im the liar.",
    "Mother was dead when I went up to her.",
    "Itit quite knocked me\nout.",
    "You see Id been going to have it out with her.",
    "To tell her that from henceforth I\nwas a free agent.",
    "I was all set you understand.",
    "And there she wasdead Her hand\nall cold and flabby.",
    "And I thoughtjust what you said.",
    "I thought maybe Carolyou see\nthere was the mark on her wrist\nPoirot said quickly That is the one point on which I am not yet completely\ninformed.",
    "What was the method you counted on employing You had a methodand\nit was connected with a hypodermic syringe.",
    "That much I know.",
    "If you want me to\nbelieve you you must tell me the rest.",
    "Raymond said hurriedly It was a way I read in a bookan English detective\nstory.",
    "You stuck an empty hypodermic syringe into someone and it did the trick.",
    "It\nsounded perfectly scientific.",
    "II thought wed do it that way.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "I comprehend.",
    "And you purchased a syringe\nNo.",
    "As a matter of fact we pinched Nadines.",
    "Poirot shot a quick look at her.",
    "The syringe that is in your baggage in\nJerusalem he murmured.",
    "A faint color showed in the young womans face.",
    "II wasnt sure what had\nbecome of it she said\nPoirot murmured You are so quickwitted Madame.",
    "16\nThere was a pause.",
    "Then clearing his throat with a slightly affected sound\nPoirot went on We have now solved the mystery of what I might term the second\nhypodermic.",
    "That belonged to Mrs. Lennox Boynton was taken by Raymond\nBoynton before leaving Jerusalem was taken from Raymond by Carol after the\ndiscovery of Mrs. Boyntons dead body was thrown away by her found by Miss\nPierce and claimed by Miss King as hers.",
    "I presume Miss King has it now.",
    "I have said Sarah.",
    "So that when you said it was yours just now you were doing what you told us\nyou do not doyou told a lie.",
    "Sarah said calmly Thats a different kind of lie.",
    "It isntit isnt a professional\nlie.",
    "Gerard nodded appreciation.",
    "Yes it is a point that.",
    "I understand you perfectly\nMademoiselle.",
    "Thanks said Sarah.",
    "Again Poirot cleared his throat Let us now review our time table Thus\nBoyntons and Jefferson Cope leave the camp 305 approx.",
    "Dr. Gerard and Sarah King leave the camp 315 approx.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 97\n\nLady Westholme and Miss Pierce leave the camp 415\nDr. Gerard returns to camp 420 approx.",
    "Lennox Boynton returns to camp 435\nNadine Boynton returns to camp and talks to Mrs. Boynton 440 approx.",
    "Nadine Boynton leaves her motherinlaw and goes to marquee 450 approx.",
    "Carol Boynton returns to camp 510\nLady Westholme Miss Pierce and M. Jefferson Cope return to camp 540\nRaymond Boynton returns to camp 550\nSarah King returns to camp 600\nBody discovered 630\nThere is you will notice a gap of twenty minutes between fourfifty when\nNadine Boynton left her motherinlaw and fiveten when Carol returned.",
    "Therefore\nif Carol is speaking the truth Mrs. Boynton must have been killed in that twenty\nminutes.",
    "Now who could have killed her At that time Miss King and Raymond\nBoynton were together.",
    "Mr.",
    "Cope not that he had any perceivable motive for killing\nher has an alibi.",
    "He was with Lady Westholme and Miss Pierce.",
    "Lennox Boynton\nwas with his wife in the marquee.",
    "Dr. Gerard was groaning with fever in his tent.",
    "The\ncamp is deserted the boys are asleep.",
    "It is a suitable moment for a crime Was there\na person who could have committed it\nHis eyes went thoughtfully to Ginevra Boynton.",
    "There was one person.",
    "Ginevra Boynton was in her tent all the afternoon.",
    "That is what we have been toldbut actually there is evidence that she was not in her\ntent all the time Ginevra Boynton made a very significant remark.",
    "She said that Dr.\nGerard spoke her name in his fever.",
    "And Dr. Gerard has also told us that he dreamt\nin his fever of Ginevra Boyntons face.",
    "But it was not a dream It was actually her\nface he saw standing there by his bed.",
    "He thought it an effect of feverbut it was the\ntruth.",
    "Ginevra was in Dr. Gerards tent.",
    "Is it not possible that she had come to put\nback the hypodermic syringe after using it\nGinevra Boynton raised her head with its crown of redgold hair.",
    "Her wide\nbeautiful eyes stared at Poirot.",
    "They were singularly expressionless.",
    "She looked like\na vague saint.",
    "Ah Me non cried Dr. Gerard.",
    "Is it then so psychologically impossible inquired Poirot.",
    "The Frenchmans eyes dropped.",
    "Nadine Boynton said sharply Its quite impossible\nPoirots eyes came quickly round to her.",
    "Impossible Madame\nYes.",
    "She paused bit her lip then went on I will not hear of such a\ndisgraceful accusation against my young sisterinlaw.",
    "Weall of usknow it to be\nimpossible.",
    "Ginevra moved a little on her chair.",
    "The lines of her mouth relaxed into a\nsmilethe touching innocent halfunconscious smile of a very young girl.",
    "Nadine said again Impossible.",
    "Her gentle face had hardened into lines of determination.",
    "The eyes that met\nPoirots were hard and unflinching.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie 98\n\nPoirot leaned forward in what was half a bow.",
    "Madame is very intelligent he\nsaid.",
    "Nadine said quietly What do you mean by that M. Poirot\nI mean Madame that all along I have realized you have what I believe is\ncalled an excellent headpiece.",
    "You flatter me.",
    "I think not.",
    "All along you have envisaged the situation calmly and collectedly.",
    "You have remained on outwardly good terms with your husbands mother deeming\nthat the best thing to be done but inwardly you have judged and condemned her.",
    "I\nthink that some time ago you realized that the only chance for your husbands\nhappiness was for him to make an effort to leave homestrike out on his own no\nmatter how difficult and penurious such a life might be.",
    "You were willing to take all\nrisks and you endeavored to influence him to exactly that course of action.",
    "But you\nfailed Madame.",
    "Lennox Boynton had no longer the will to freedom.",
    "He was content\nto sink into a condition of apathy and melancholy.",
    "Now I have no doubt at all Madame but that you love your husband.",
    "Your\ndecision to leave him was not actuated by a greater love for another man.",
    "It was I\nthink a desperate venture undertaken as a last hope.",
    "A woman in your position\ncould only try three things.",
    "She could try appeal.",
    "That as I have said failed.",
    "She\ncould threaten to leave her husband.",
    "But it is possible that even that threat would not\nhave moved Lennox Boynton.",
    "It would plunge him deeper in misery but it would not\ncause him to rebel.",
    "There was one last desperate throw.",
    "You could go away with\nanother man.",
    "Jealousy and the instinct of possession are two of the most deeply\nrooted fundamental instincts in man.",
    "You showed your wisdom in trying to reach that\ndeep underground savage instinct.",
    "If Lennox Boynton would let you go to another\nman without an effortthen he must indeed be beyond human aid and you might as\nwell then try to make a new life for yourself elsewhere.",
    "But let us suppose that even that last desperate remedy failed.",
    "Your husband\nwas terribly upset at your decision but in spite of that he did not as you had hoped\nreact as a primitive man might have done with an uprush of the possessive instinct.",
    "Was there anything at all that could save your husband from his own rapidly failing\nmental condition Only one thing.",
    "If his stepmother were to die it might not be too\nlate.",
    "He might be able to start life anew as a free man building up in himself\nindependence and manliness once more.",
    "Poirot paused then repeated gently If your motherinlaw were to die .",
    ". .\nNadines eyes were still fixed on his.",
    "In an unmoved gentle voice she said\nYou are suggesting that I helped to bring that event about are you not But you\ncannot do so M. Poirot.",
    "After I had broken the news of my impending departure to\nMrs. Boynton I went straight to the marquee and joined Lennox.",
    "I did not leave there\nagain until my motherinlaw was found dead.",

    "Why a servant Were you not all of you most assiduous in your attendance\non the old lady as a general rule Did not one or another of you always escort her to\nmeals She was infirm.",
    "It was difficult for her to rise from a chair without assistance.",
    "Always one or another of you was at her elbow.",
    "I suggest then that on dinner being\nannounced the natural thing would have been for one or another of her family to go\nout and help her.",
    "But not one of you offered to do so.",
    "You all sat there paralyzed\nwatching each other wondering perhaps why no one went.",

    "He turned to Poirot.",
    "I assure you my friend that is so\nOh I do not doubt it said Poirot.",
    "There was a little fact I had already notedthe fact that M. Boynton had replaced his mothers wristwatch.",
    "That was capable of\ntwo explanationsit might have been a cover for the actual deed or it might have\nbeen observed and misinterpreted by young Mrs. Boynton.",
    "She returned only five\nminutes after her husband.",
    "She must therefore have seen that action.",
    "When she got\nup to her motherinlaw and found her dead with the mark of a hypodermic syringe\non her wrist she would naturally jump to the conclusion that her husband had\ncommitted the deedthat her announcement of her decision to leave him had\nproduced a reaction in him different from that for which she had hoped.",
    "Briefly.",
    "Nadine Boynton believed that she had inspired her husband to commit murder.",
    "He looked at Nadine.",
    "That is so Madame\nShe bowed her head.",
    "Then she asked Did you really suspect me M.\nPoirot\nI thought you were a possibility Madame.",
    "She leaned forward.",
    "And now What really happened M. Poirot\n17\nWhat really happened Poirot repeated.",
    "He reached behind him drew forward a chair and sat down.",
    "His manner was\nnow friendlyinformal.",
    "It is a question is it not For the digitoxin was taken the\nsyringe was missing.",
    "There was the mark of a hypodermic on Mrs. Boyntons wrist.",
    "It is true that in a few days time we shall know definitelythe autopsy will tell\nuswhether Mrs. Boynton died of an overdose of digitalis or not.",
    "But then it may be\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie102\n\ntoo late It would be better to reach the truth tonightwhile the murderer is here under\nour hand.",
    "Nadine raised her head sharply.",
    "You mean that you still believe that one of\nus here in this room Her voice died away.",
    "Poirot was slowly nodding to himself.",
    "The truththat is what I promised\nColonel Carbury.",
    "And so having cleared our path we are back again where I was\nearlier in the day writing down a list of printed facts and being faced straight away\nwith two glaring inconsistencies.",
    "Colonel Carbury spoke for the first time.",
    "Suppose now we hear what they are he suggested.",
    "Poirot said with dignity I am about to tell you.",
    "We will take once more those\nfirst two facts on my list.",
    "Mrs. Boynton was taking a mixture of digitalis and Dr.\nGerard missed a hypodermic syringe.",
    "Take those facts and set them against the\nundeniable fact with which I was immediately confronted that the Boynton family\nshowed unmistakably guilty reactions.",
    "It would seem therefore certain that one of the\nBoynton family must have committed the crime And yet those two facts I mentioned\nwere all against that theory.",
    "For see you to take a concentrated solution of digitalisthat yes it is a clever idea because Mrs. Boynton was already taking the drug.",
    "But\nwhat would a member of her family do then Ah ma foi There was only one\nsensible thing to do.",
    "Put the poison into her bottle of medicine That is what anyoneanyone with a grain of sense and who had access to the medicinewould certainly\ndo\nSooner or later Mrs. Boynton takes a dose and diesand even if the digitoxin\nis discovered in the bottle it may be set down as a mistake of the chemist who made\nit up.",
    "Certainly nothing can be proved\nWhy then the theft of the hypodermic needle\nThere can be only two explanations of that.",
    "Either Dr. Gerard overlooked the\nsyringe and it was never stolen or else the syringe was taken because the murderer\nhad not got access to the medicinethat is to say the murderer was not a member of\nthe Boynton family.",
    "The two first facts point overwhelmingly to an outsider as having\ncommitted the crime\nI saw that but I was puzzled as I say by the strong evidences of guilt\ndisplayed by the Boynton family.",
    "Was it possible that in spite of that consciousness\nof guilt the Bovntons were innocent I set out to prove not the guilt but the\ninnocence of those people\nThat is where we stand now.",
    "The murder was committed by an outsiderthat\nis by someone who was not sufficiently intimate with Mrs. Boynton to enter her tent\nor to handle her medicine bottle.",
    "He paused.",
    "There are three people in this room who are technically outsiders but who\nhave a definite connection with the case.",
    "M. Cope whom we will consider first has been closely associated with the\nBoynton family for some time.",
    "Can we discover motive and opportunity on his part It\nseems not.",
    "Mrs. Boyntons death has affected him adverselysince it has brought\nabout the frustration of certain hopes.",
    "Unless M. Copes motive was an almost\nfanatical desire to benefit others we can find no reason for his desiring Mrs.\nBoyntons death.",
    "Unless of course there is a motive about which we are entirely in\nthe dark.",
    "We do not know exactly what M. Copes dealings with the Boynton family\nhave been.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie103\n\nMr.",
    "Cope said with dignity This seems to me a little farfetched M. Poirot.",
    "You must remember I had absolutely no opportunity for committing this deed and in\nany case.",
    "I hold very strong views as to the sanctity of human life.",
    "Your position certainly seems impeccable said Poirot with gravity.",
    "In a\nwork of fiction you would be strongly suspected on that account.",
    "He turned a little in his chair.",
    "We now come to Miss King.",
    "Miss King had a\ncertain amount of motive and she had the necessary medical knowledge and is a\nperson of character and determination but since she left the camp before threethirty\nwith the others and did not return to it until six oclock it seems difficult to see where\nshe could have had an opportunity.",
    "Next we must consider Dr. Gerard.",
    "Now here we must take into account the\nactual time that the murder was committed.",
    "According to M. Lennox Boyntons last\nstatement his mother was dead at four thirtyfive.",
    "According to Lady Westholme and\nMiss Pierce she was alive at fourfifteen when they started on their walk.",
    "That\nleaves exactly twenty minutes unaccounted for.",
    "Now as these two ladies walked\naway from the camp Dr. Gerard passed them going to it.",
    "There is no one to say what\nDr. Gerards movements were when he reached the camp because the two ladies\nbacks were towards it.",
    "They were walking away from it.",
    "Therefore it is perfectly\npossible for Dr. Gerard to have committed the crime.",
    "Being a doctor he could easily\ncounterfeit the appearance of malaria.",
    "There is I should say a possible motive.",
    "Dr.\nGerard might have wished to save a certain person whose reason perhaps more\nvital a loss than a loss of life was in danger and he may have considered the\nsacrifice of an old and worn out life worth it\nYour ideas said Dr. Gerard are fantastic He smiled amiably.",
    "Without taking any notice Poirot went on.",
    "But if so why did Gerard call\nattention to the possibility of foul play It is quite certain that but for his statement to\nColonel Carbury Mrs. Boyntons death would have been put down to natural causes.",
    "It was Dr. Gerard who first pointed out the possibility of murder.",
    "That my friends\nsaid Poirot does not make common sense\nDoesnt seem to said Colonel Carbury gruffly.",
    "He looked curiously at Poirot.",
    "There is one more possibility said Poirot.",
    "Mrs. Lennox Boynton just now\nnegated strongly the possibility of her young sisterinlaw being guilty.",
    "The force of\nher objection lay in the fact that she knew her motherinlaw to be dead at the time.",
    "But remember this Ginevra Boynton was at the camp all the afternoon.",
    "And there\nwas a momenta moment when Lady Westholme and Miss Pierce were walking\naway from the camp and before Dr. Gerard had returned to it .",
    ". .\nGinevra stirred.",
    "She leaned forward staring into Poirots face with a strange\ninnocent puzzled stare.",
    "I did it You think I did it Then suddenly with a\nmovement of swift incomparable beauty she was up from her chair and had flung\nherself across the room and down on her knees beside Dr. Gerard clinging to him\ngazing up passionately into his face.",
    "No No Dont let them say it Theyre making the walls close around me\nagain Its not true I never did anything They are my enemiesthey want to put me in\nprisonto shut me up.",
    "You must help me You must help me\nThere there my child.",
    "Gently the doctor patted her head.",
    "Then he\naddressed Poirot.",
    "What you say is nonsenseabsurd.",
    "Delusions of persecution murmured Poirot.",
    "Yesbut she could never have done it that way.",
    "She would have done it you\nmust perceive dramaticallya dagger something flamboyant spectacularnever this\ncool calm logic I tell you my friends it is so.",
    "This was a reasoned crimea sane\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie104\n\ncrime.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "Unexpectedly he bowed.",
    "Je suis entierement de votre avis he\nsaid smoothly.",
    "18\nCome said Hercule Poirot.",
    "We have still a little way to go Dr. Gerard has\ninvoked the psychology.",
    "So let us now examine the psychological side of the case.",
    "We have taken the facts we have established a chronological sequence of events\nwe have heard the evidence.",
    "There remainsthe psychology.",
    "And the most important\npsychological evidence concerns the dead woman.",
    "It is the psychology of Mrs.\nBoynton herself that is the most important thing in this case.",
    "Take from my list of specified facts points three and four.",
    "Mrs. Boynton took\ndefinite pleasure in keeping her family from enjoying themselves with other people.",
    "Mrs. Boynton on the afternoon in question encouraged her family to go away and\nleave her.",
    "These two facts they contradict each other flatly Why on this particular\nafternoon should Mrs. Boynton suddenly display a complete reversal of her usual\npolicy Was it that she felt a sudden warmth of the heartan instinct of benevolence\nThat it seems to me from all I have heard was extremely unlikely Yet there must\nhave been a reason.",
    "What was that reason\nLet us examine closely the character of Mrs. Boynton.",
    "There have been\nmany different accounts of her.",
    "She was a tyrannical old martinet she was a mental\nsadist she was an incarnation of evil she was crazy.",
    "Which of these views is the\ntrue one\nI think myself that Sarah King came nearest to the truth when in a flash of\ninspiration in Jerusalem she saw the old lady as intensely pathetic.",
    "But not only\npatheticfutile\nLet us if we can think ourselves into the mental condition of Mrs. Boynton.",
    "A\nhuman creature born with immense ambition with a yearning to dominate and to\nimpress her personality on other people.",
    "She neither sublimated that intense craving\nfor power nor did she seek to master it.",
    "No mes dames and messieurs she fed it\nBut in the endlisten well to thisin the end what did it amount to She was not a\ngreat power She was not feared and hated over a wide area She was the petty\ntyrant of one isolated family And as Dr. Gerard said to meshe became bored like\nany other old lady with her hobby and she sought to extend her activities and to\namuse herself by making her dominance more precarious But that led to an entirely\ndifferent aspect of the case By coming abroad she realized for the first time how\nextremely insignificant she was\nAnd now we come directly to point number tenthe words spoken to Sarah\nKing in Jerusalem.",
    "Sarah King you see had put her finger on the truth.",
    "She had\nrevealed fully and uncompromisingly the pitiful futility of Mrs. Boyntons scheme of\nexistence And now listen very carefullyall of youto what her exact words to Miss\nKing were.",
    "Miss King has said that Mrs. Boynton spoke so malevolently not even\nlooking at me.",
    "And this is what she actually said Ive never forgotten anything not\nan action not a name not a face.",
    "Those words made a great impression on Miss King.",
    "Their extraordinary\nintensity and the loud hoarse tone in which they were uttered So strong was the\nimpression they left on her mind I think that she quite failed to realize their\nextraordinary significance\nDo you see that significance any of you He waited a minute.",
    "It seems not.",
    "\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie105\n\n.",
    ". .",
    "But mes amis does it escape you that those words were not a reasonable\nanswer at all to what Miss King had just been saying.",
    "Ive never forgotten anything\nnot an action not a name not a face.",
    "It does not make sense If she had said I\nnever forget impertinencesomething of that kindbut noa face is what she said. . . .\nAh cried Poirot beating his hands together.",
    "But it leaps to the eye Those\nwords ostensibly spoken to Miss King were not meant for Miss King at all They\nwere addressed to someone else standing behind Miss King.",
    "He paused noting their expressions.",
    "Yes it leaps to the eye That was I tell you a psychological moment in Mrs.\nBoyntons life She had been exposed to herself by an intelligent young woman She\nwas full of baffled fury and at that moment she recognized someonea face from the\npasta victim delivered bound into her hands\nWe are back you see to the outsider And now the meaning of Mrs.\nBoyntons unexpected amiability on the afternoon of her death is clear.",
    "She wanted\nto get rid of her family becauseto use a vulgarityshe had other fish to fry She\nwanted the field left clear for an interview with a new victim. . . .\nNow from that new standpoint let us consider the events of the afternoon\nThe Boynton family goes off.",
    "Mrs. Boynton sits up by her cave.",
    "Now let us consider\nvery carefully the evidence of Lady Westholme and Miss Pierce.",
    "The latter is an\nunreliable witness she is unobservant and very suggestible.",
    "Lady Westholme on\nthe other hand is perfectly clear as to her facts and meticulously observant.",
    "Both\nladies agree on one fact An Arab one of the servants approaches Mrs. Boynton\nangers her in some way and retires hastily.",
    "Lady Westholme states definitely that the\nservant had first been into the tent occupied by Ginevra Boynton but you may\nremember that Dr. Gerards tent was next door to Ginevras.",
    "It is possible that it was\nDr. Gerards tent the Arab entered. . . .",
    "Colonel Carbury said Dyou mean to tell me that one of those Bedouin\nfellows of mine murdered an old lady by sticking her with a hypodermic Fantastic\nWait Colonel Carbury I have not yet finished.",
    "Let us agree that the Arab\nmight have come from Dr. Gerards tent and not Ginevra Boyntons.",
    "What is the next\nthing Both ladies agree that they could not see his face clearly enough to identify\nhim and that they did not hear what was said.",
    "That is understandable.",
    "The distance\nbetween the marquee and the ledge is about two hundred yards.",
    "Lady Westholme\ngave a clear description of the man otherwise describing in detail his ragged\nbreeches and the untidiness with which his puttees were rolled.",
    "Poirot leaned forward.",
    "And that my friends was very odd indeed Because if\nshe could not see his face or hear what was said she could not possibly have\nnoticed the state of his breeches and puttees Not at two hundred yards\nIt was an error that you see It suggested a curious idea to me.",
    "Why insist\nso on the ragged breeches and untidy puttees.",
    "Could it be because the breeches\nwere not torn and the puttees were nonexistent Lady Westholme and Miss Pierce\nboth saw the manbut from where they were sitting they could not see each other.",
    "That is shown by the fact that Lady Westholme came to see if Miss Pierce was\nawake and found her sitting in the entrance of her tent.",
    "Good Lord said Colonel Carbury suddenly sitting up very straight.",
    "Are you\nsuggesting\nI am suggesting that having ascertained just what Miss Pierce the only\nwitness likely to be awake was doing Lady Westholme returned to her tent put on\nher riding breeches boots and khakicolored coat made herself an Arab headdress\nwith her checked duster and a skein of knitting wool and that thus attired she went\n\n\f\u201cAppointment With Death\u201d By Agatha Christie106\n\nboldly up to Dr. Gerards tent looked in his medicine chest selected a suitable drug\ntook the hypodermic filled it and went boldly up to her victim.",
    "Mrs. Boynton may have been dozing.",
    "Lady Westholme was quick.",
    "She\ncaught her by the wrist and injected the stuff.",
    "Mrs. Boynton half cried outtried to\nrisethen sank back.",
    "The Arab hurried away with every evidence of being ashamed\nand abashed.",
    "Mrs. Boynton shook her stick tried to rise then fell back into her\nchair.",
    "Five minutes later Lady Westholme rejoins Miss Pierce and comments on the\nscene she has just witnessed impressing her own version of it on the other.",
    "Then\nthey go for a walk pausing below the ledge where Lady Westholme shouts up to the\nold lady.",
    "She receives no answer for Mrs. Boynton is dead but she remarks to Miss\nPierce Very rude just to snort at us like that Miss Pierce accepts the suggestion.",
    "She has often heard Mrs. Boynton receive a remark with a snortshe will swear quite\nsincerely if necessary that she actually heard it.",
    "Lady Westholme has sat on\ncommittees often enough with women of Miss Pierees type to know exactly how her\nown eminence and masterful personality can influence them.",
    "The only point where\nher plan went astray was the replacing of the syringe.",
    "Dr. Gerard returning so soon\nupset her scheme.",
    "She hoped he might not have noticed its absence or might think\nhe had overlooked it and she put it back during the night.",
    "He stopped.",
    "Sarah said But why Why should Lady Westholme want to kill old Mrs.\nBoynton\nDid you not tell me that Lady Westholme had been quite near you in\nJerusalem when you spoke to Mrs. Boynton It was to Lady Westholme that Mrs.\nBoyntons words were addressed.",
    "Ive never forgotten anything not an action not a\nname not a face.",
    "Put that with the fact that Mrs. Boynton had been a wardress in a\nprison and you can get a very shrewd idea of the truth.",
    "Lord Westholme met his wife\non a voyage back from America.",
    "Lady Westholme before her marriage had been a\ncriminal and had served a prison sentence.",
    "You see the terrible dilemma she was in Her career her ambitions her\nsocial positionall at stake What the crime was for which she served a sentence in\nprison we do not yet know though we soon shall but it must have been one that\nwould effectually blast her political career if it was made public.",
    "And remember this\nMrs. Boynton was not an ordinary blackmailer.",
    "She did not want money.",
    "She wanted\nthe pleasure of torturing her victim for a while and then she would have enjoyed\nrevealing the truth in the most spectacular fashion No while Mrs. Boynton lived\nLady Westholme was not safe.",
    "She obeyed Mrs. Boyntons instructions to meet her\nat Petra I thought it strange all along that a woman with such a sense of her own\nimportance as Lady Westholme should have preferred to travel as a mere tourist\nbut in her own mind she was doubtless revolving ways and means of murder.",
    "She\nsaw her chance and carried it out boldly.",
    "She only made two slips.",
