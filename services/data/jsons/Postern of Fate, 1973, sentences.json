    "She produced the word rather with the effect of a badtempered\nexplosion.",
    "\u201cWhat did you say\u201d said Tommy.",
    "Tuppence looked across the room at him.",
    "\u201cI said \u2018books\u2019 \u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI see what you mean\u201d said Thomas Beresford.",

    "One doesn\u2019t know ever exactly what one wants to\ndo.",
    "Oh dear\u201d she sighed.",
    "\u201cReally\u201d said her husband \u201cI should have thought that that was not\nat all characteristic of you.",
    "The trouble with you has always been that\nyou knew much too well what you do want to do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I mean is\u201d said Tuppence \u201cthat here we are getting older\ngetting a bit\u2014well let\u2019s face it\u2014definitely rheumatic especially when\none is stretching you know stretching putting in books or lifting things\n\n\fdown from shelves or kneeling down to look at the bottom shelves for\nsomething then finding it a bit difficult to get up again.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes\u201d said Tommy \u201cthat\u2019s an account of our general\ndisabilities.",
    "Is that what you started to say\u201d\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t what I started to say.",
    "What I started to say was it was\nlovely to be able to buy a new home and find just the place we wanted to\ngo and live in and just the house there we\u2019d always dreamt of having\u2014\nwith a little alteration of course.\u201d\n\u201cKnocking one or two rooms into each other\u201d said Tommy \u201cand\nadding to it what you call a veranda and your builder calls a lodger\nthough I prefer to call it a loggia.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be very nice\u201d said Tuppence firmly.",
    "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve done it I shan\u2019t know it Is that the answer\u201d said\nTommy.",
    "\u201cNot at all.",
    "All I said was that when you see it finished you\u2019re going\nto be delighted and say what an ingenious and clever and artistic wife\nyou have.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll remember the right thing to say.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t need to remember\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIt will burst upon\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with books\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cWell we brought two or three cases of books with us.",
    "I mean we\nsold off the books we didn\u2019t much care about.",
    "We brought the ones we\nreally couldn\u2019t bear to part with and then of course the whatyoucall\u2019ems\u2014I can\u2019t remember their name now but the people who were\nselling us this house\u2014they didn\u2019t want to take a lot of their own things\nwith them and they said if we\u2019d like to make an offer they would leave\nthings including books and we came and looked at things\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd we made some offers\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Not as many as they hoped we would make I expect.",
    "Some of\nthe furniture and ornaments were too horrible.",
    "Well fortunately we\ndidn\u2019t have to take those but when I came and saw the various books\u2014\nthere were some nursery ones you know some down in the sitting room\n\u2014and there are one or two old favourites.",
    "I mean there still are.",
    "There\nare one or two of my own special favourites.",
    "And so I thought it\u2019d be\n\n\fsuch fun to have them.",
    "You know the story of Androcles and the Lion\u201d\nshe said.",
    "\u201cI remember reading that when I was eight years old.",
    "Andrew\nLang.\u201d\n\u201cTell me Tuppence were you clever enough to read at eight years\nold\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tuppence \u201cI read at five years old.",
    "Everybody could\nwhen I was young.",
    "I didn\u2019t know one even had to sort of learn.",
    "I mean\nsomebody would read stories aloud and you liked them very much and\nyou remembered where the book went back on the shelf and you were\nalways allowed to take it out and have a look at it yourself and so you\nfound you were reading it too without bothering to learn to spell or\nanything like that.",
    "It wasn\u2019t so good later\u201d she said \u201cbecause I\u2019ve never\nbeen able to spell very well.",
    "And if somebody had taught me to spell\nwhen I was about four years old I can see it would have been very good\nindeed.",
    "My father did teach me to do addition and subtraction and\nmultiplication of course because he said the multiplication table was the\nmost useful thing you could learn in life and I learnt long division too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a clever man he must have been\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he was specially clever\u201d said Tuppence \u201cbut he was\njust very very nice.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t we getting away from the point\u201d\n\u201cYes we are\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cWell as I said when I thought of\nreading Androcles and the Lion again\u2014it came in a book of stories about\nanimals I think by Andrew Lang\u2014oh I loved that.",
    "And there was a\nstory about \u2018a day in my life at Eton\u2019 by an Eton schoolboy.",
    "I can\u2019t think\nwhy I wanted to read that but I did.",
    "It was one of my favourite books.",
    "And there were some stories from the classics and there was Mrs.\nMolesworth The Cuckoo Clock Four Winds Farm\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s all right\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cNo need to give me a whole\naccount of your literary triumphs in early youth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I mean is\u201d said Tuppence \u201cthat you can\u2019t get them nowadays.",
    "I mean sometimes you get reprints of them but they\u2019ve usually been\naltered and have different pictures in them.",
    "Really the other day I\ncouldn\u2019t recognize Alice in Wonderland when I saw it.",
    "Everything looks\nso peculiar in it.",
    "There are the books I really could get still.",
    "Mrs.\n\n\fMolesworth one or two of the old fairy books\u2014Pink Blue and Yellow\n\u2014and then of course lots of later ones which I\u2019d enjoyed.",
    "Lots of\nStanley Weymans and things like that.",
    "There are quite a lot here left\nbehind.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cYou were tempted.",
    "You felt it was a good\nbuy.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "At least\u2014what d\u2019you mean a \u2018goodbye\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cI mean buy\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cOh.",
    "I thought you were going to leave the room and were saying\ngoodbye to me.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all\u201d said Tommy \u201cI was deeply interested.",
    "Anyway it was a\ngood buy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I got them very cheap as I tell you.",
    "And\u2014and here they all are\namong our own books and others.",
    "Only we\u2019ve got such a terrible lot\nnow of books and the shelves we had made I don\u2019t think are going to be\nnearly enough.",
    "What about your special sanctum Is there room there for\nmore books\u201d\n\u201cNo there isn\u2019t\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be enough for\nmy own.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear oh dear\u201d said Tuppence \u201cthat\u2019s so like us.",
    "Do you think\nwe might have to build on an extra room\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tommy \u201cwe\u2019re going to economize.",
    "We said so the day\nbefore yesterday.",
    "Do you remember\u201d\n\u201cThat was the day before yesterday\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cTime alters.",
    "What I am going to do now is put in these shelves all the books I really\ncan\u2019t bear to part with.",
    "And then\u2014and then we can look at the others and\n\u2014well there might be a children\u2019s hospital somewhere and there might\nanyway be places which would like books.\u201d\n\u201cOr we could sell them\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose they\u2019re the sort of books people would want to buy\nvery much.",
    "I don\u2019t think there are any books of rare value or anything\nlike that.\u201d\n\u201cYou never know your luck\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s hope something\nout of print will fulfil some bookseller\u2019s longfelt want.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIn the meantime\u201d said Tuppence \u201cwe have to put them into the\nshelves and look inside them of course each time to see whether it\u2019s a\nbook I do really want and I can really remember.",
    "I\u2019m trying to get them\nroughly\u2014well you know what I mean sort of sorted.",
    "I mean adventure\nstories fairy stories children\u2019s stories and those stories about schools\nwhere the children were always very rich\u2014L.",
    "T. Meade I think.",
    "And\nsome of the books we used to read to Deborah when she was small too.",
    "How we all used to love Winnie the Pooh.",
    "And there was The Little Grey\nHen too but I didn\u2019t care very much for that.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re tiring yourself\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI think I should leave\noff what you\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\u201cWell perhaps I will\u201d said Tuppence \u201cbut I think if I could just\nfinish this side of the room just get the books in here.",
    ". . .\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll help you\u201d said Tommy.",
    "He came over tilted the case so that the books fell out gathered up\narmfuls of them and went to the shelves and shoved them in.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m putting the same sized ones together it looks neater\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOh I don\u2019t call that sorting\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cSorting enough to get on with.",
    "We can do more of that later.",
    "You\nknow make everything really nice.",
    "We\u2019ll sort it on some wet day when\nwe can\u2019t think of anything else to do.\u201d\n\u201cThe trouble is we always can think of something else to do.\u201d\n\u201cWell now there\u2019s another seven in there.",
    "Now then there\u2019s only this\ntop corner.",
    "Just bring me that wooden chair over there will you Are its\nlegs strong enough for me to stand on it Then I can put some on the top\nshelf.\u201d\nWith some care he climbed on the chair.",
    "Tuppence lifted up to him an\narmful of books.",
    "He insinuated them with some care on to the top shelf.",
    "Disaster only happened with the last three which cascaded to the floor\nnarrowly missing Tuppence.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d said Tuppence \u201cthat was painful.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t help it.",
    "You handed me up too many at once.\u201d\n\u201cOh well that does look wonderful\u201d said Tuppence standing back a\nlittle.",
    "\u201cNow then if you\u2019ll just put these in the second shelf from the\nbottom there\u2019s a gap there that will finish up this particular caseful\n\n\fanyway.",
    "It\u2019s a good thing too.",
    "These ones I\u2019m doing this morning aren\u2019t\nreally ours they\u2019re the ones we bought.",
    "We may find treasures.\u201d\n\u201cWe may\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI think we shall find treasures.",
    "I think I really shall find something.",
    "Something that\u2019s worth a lot of money perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do we do then Sell it\u201d\n\u201cI expect we\u2019ll have to sell it yes\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cOf course we\nmight just keep it and show it to people.",
    "You know not exactly boasting\nbut just say you know \u2018Oh yes we\u2019ve got really one or two interesting\nfinds.\u2019 I think we shall make an interesting find too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014one old favourite you\u2019ve forgotten about\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly that.",
    "I meant something startling surprising.",
    "Something\nthat\u2019ll make all the difference to our lives.\u201d\n\u201cOh Tuppence\u201d said Tommy \u201cwhat a wonderful mind you\u2019ve got.",
    "Much more likely to find something that\u2019s an absolute disaster.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cOne must have hope.",
    "It\u2019s the great\nthing you have to have in life.",
    "Hope.",
    "Remember I\u2019m always full of\nhope.\u201d\n\u201cI know you are\u201d said Tommy.",
    "He sighed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve often regretted it.\u201d\n\n\fTwo\nTHE BLACK ARROW\n\nMrs.\n\nThomas Beresford replaced The Cuckoo Clock by Mrs.\n\nMolesworth choosing a vacant place on the third shelf from the bottom.",
    "The Mrs. Molesworths were congregated here together.",
    "Tuppence drew\nout The Tapestry Room and held it thoughtfully in her fingers.",
    "Or she\nmight read Four Winds Farm.",
    "She couldn\u2019t remember Four Winds Farm\nas well as she could remember The Cuckoo Clock and The Tapestry\nRoom.",
    "Her fingers wandered .",
    ". . Tommy would be back soon.",
    "She was getting on.",
    "Yes surely she was getting on.",
    "If only she didn\u2019t\nstop and pull out old favourites and read them.",
    "Very agreeable but it took\na lot of time.",
    "And when Tommy asked her in the evening when he came\nhome how things were going and she said \u201cOh very well now\u201d she had\nto employ a great deal of tact and finesse to prevent him from going\nupstairs and having a real look at how the bookshelves were progressing.",
    "It all took a long time.",
    "Getting into a house always took a long time\nmuch longer than one thought.",
    "And so many irritating people.",
    "Electricians for instance who came and appeared to be displeased with\nwhat they had done the last time they came and took up more large areas\nin the floor and with cheerful faces produced more pitfalls for the\nunwary housewife to walk along and put a foot wrong and be rescued\njust in time by the unseen electrician who was groping beneath the floor.",
    "\u201cSometimes\u201d said Tuppence \u201cI really wish we hadn\u2019t left Bartons\nAcre.\u201d\n\u201cRemember the dining room\u201d Tommy had said \u201cand remember\nthose attics and remember what happened to the garage.",
    "Nearly wrecked\n\n\fthe car you know it did.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose we could have had it patched up\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d said Tommy \u201cwe\u2019d have had to practically replace the\ndamaged building or else we had to move.",
    "This is going to be a very\nnice house some day.",
    "I\u2019m quite sure of that.",
    "Anyway there\u2019s going to be\nroom in it for all the things we want to do.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you say the things we want to do\u201d Tuppence had said \u201cyou\nmean the things we want to find places for and to keep.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cOne keeps far too much.",
    "I couldn\u2019t agree\nwith you more.\u201d\nAt that moment Tuppence considered something\u2014whether they ever\nwere going to do anything with this house that is to say beyond getting\ninto it.",
    "It sounded simple but had turned out complex.",
    "Partly of course\nall these books.",
    "\u201cIf I\u2019d been a nice ordinary child of nowadays\u201d said Tuppence \u201cI\nwouldn\u2019t have learned to read so easily when I was young.",
    "Children\nnowadays who are four or five or six don\u2019t seem to be able to read\nwhen they get to ten or eleven.",
    "I can\u2019t think why it was so easy for all of\nus.",
    "We could all read.",
    "Me and Martin next door and Jennifer down the\nroad and Cyril and Winifred.",
    "All of us.",
    "I don\u2019t mean we could all spell\nvery well but we could read anything we wanted to.",
    "I don\u2019t know how\nwe learnt.",
    "Asking people I suppose.",
    "Things about posters and Carter\u2019s\nLittle Liver Pills.",
    "We used to read all about them in the fields when trains\ngot near London.",
    "It was very exciting.",
    "I always wondered what they\nwere.",
    "Oh dear I must think of what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nShe removed some more books.",
    "Threequarters of an hour passed\nwith her absorbed first in Alice Through the LookingGlass then with\nCharlotte Yonge\u2019s Unknown to History.",
    "Her hands lingered over the fat\nshabbiness of The Daisy Chain.",
    "\u201cOh I must read that again\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cTo think of the years\nand years and years it is since I did read it.",
    "Oh dear how exciting it was\nwondering you know whether Norman was going to be allowed to be\nconfirmed or not.",
    "And Ethel and\u2014what was the name of the place\nCoxwell or something like\u2014and Flora who was worldly.",
    "I wonder why\neveryone was \u2018worldly\u2019 in those days and how poorly it was thought of\n\n\fbeing worldly.",
    "I wonder what we are now.",
    "Do you think we\u2019re all\nworldly or not\u201d\n\u201cI beg yer pardon ma\u2019am\u201d\n\u201cOh nothing\u201d said Tuppence looking round at her devoted\nhenchman Albert who had just appeared in the doorway.",
    "\u201cI thought you called for something madam.",
    "And you rang the bell\ndidn\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cNot really\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI just leant on it getting up on a chair to\ntake a book out.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything I can take down for you\u201d\n\u201cWell I wish you would\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m falling off those\nchairs.",
    "Some of their legs are very wobbly some of them rather\nslippery.\u201d\n\u201cAny book in particular\u201d\n\u201cWell I haven\u2019t got on very far with the third shelf up.",
    "Two shelves\ndown from the top you know.",
    "I don\u2019t know what books are there.\u201d\nAlbert mounted on a chair and banging each book in turn to dislodge\nsuch dust as it had managed to gather on it handed things down.",
    "Tuppence received them with a good deal of rapture.",
    "\u201cOh fancy All these.",
    "I really have forgotten a lot of these.",
    "Oh\nhere\u2019s The Amulet and here\u2019s The Psamayad.",

    "Now what\u2019s this one Let me see.",
    "The Red Cockade.",
    "Oh yes\nthat was one of the historical ones.",
    "That was very exciting.",
    "And there\u2019s\nUnder the Red Robe too.",
    "Lots of Stanley Weyman.",
    "Lots and lots.",
    "Of\ncourse I used to read those when I was about ten or eleven.",

    "\u201cYes.",
    "Yes you\u2019re quite right.",
    "Afterwards they suspected that it\nwasn\u2019t her real name.",
    "I think somebody had suspected her for some time.",
    "The boy had Alexander.",
    "Nice boy.",
    "Quite sharp too.\u201d\n\n\fBOOK II\n\n\fOne\nA LONG TIME AGO\n\nTuppence was selecting birthday cards.",

    "Houses change names a\nlot around here.",
    "People do like giving new names to houses you know.\u201d\n\u201cYes they certainly seem to\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cEven we\nhave thought of a name or two.",
    "By the way Beatrice told me that you\nknew someone once living here called Mary Jordan.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI didn\u2019t know her but I have heard her mentioned.",
    "In the war it was\nnot the last war.",
    "The one long before that when there used to be\nzeppelins.\u201d\n\u201cI remember hearing about zeppelins\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIn 1915 or 1916\u2014they came over London.\u201d\n\u201cI remember I\u2019d gone to the Army  Navy Stores one day with an\nold greataunt and there was an alarm.\u201d\n\u201cThey used to come over at night sometimes didn\u2019t they Must have\nbeen rather frightening I should think.\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t think it was really\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cPeople used to get\nquite excited.",
    "It wasn\u2019t nearly as frightening as the flying bombs\u2014in this\nlast war.",
    "One always felt rather as though they were following you to\nplaces.",
    "Following you down a street or something like that\u201d\n\u201cSpend all your nights in the tube did you I had a friend in London.",

    "Everyone used to have their own particular tube station.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t in London in the last war\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think\nI\u2019d have liked to spend all night in the tube.\u201d\n\u201cWell this friend of mine Jenny her name was oh she used to love\nthe tube.",
    "She said it was ever so much fun.",
    "You know you had your own\nparticular stair in the tube.",

    "Trains going on right up to the morning.",
    "She told me she couldn\u2019t\nbear it when the war was over and she had to go home again felt it was\nso dull you know.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway\u201d said Tuppence \u201cthere weren\u2019t any flying bombs in 1914.",
    "Just the zeppelins.\u201d\nZeppelins had clearly lost interest for Gwenda.",
    "\u201cIt was someone called Mary Jordan I was asking about\u201d said\nTuppence.",
    "\u201cBeatrice said you knew about her.\u201d\n\u201cNot really\u2014I just heard her name mentioned once or twice but it\nwas ages ago.",

    "They were beginning to suspect but she got\nill and died before that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did she die of Did she die down here I suppose she went to\nhospital.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t think there were any hospitals to go to then.",
    "Wasn\u2019t any\nWelfare in those days.",
    "Somebody told me it was some silly mistake the\ncook made.",
    "Brought foxglove leaves into the house by mistake for\nspinach\u2014or for lettuce perhaps.",
    "No I think that was someone else.",
    "Someone told me it was deadly nightshade but I don\u2019t believe that for a\nmoment because I mean everyone knows about deadly nightshade\ndon\u2019t they and anyway that\u2019s berries.",
    "Well I think this was foxglove\nleaves brought in from the garden by mistake.",
    "Foxglove is Digoxo or\nsome name like Digit\u2014something that sounds like fingers.",
    "It\u2019s got\nsomething very deadly in it\u2014the doctor came and he did what he could\nbut I think it was too late.\u201d\n\u201cWere there many people in the house when it happened\u201d\n\u201cOh there was quite a lot I should think\u2014yes because there were\nalways people staying so I\u2019ve heard and children you know and\nweekenders and a nursery maid and a governess I think and parties.",
    "Mind you I\u2019m not knowing all about this myself.",
    "It\u2019s only what Granny\nused to tell me.",
    "And old Mr. Bodlicott talks now and then.",
    "You know the\nold gardener chap as works here now and then.",
    "He was gardener there\nand they blamed him at first for sending the wrong leaves but it wasn\u2019t\nhim as did it.",
    "It was somebody who came out of the house and wanted to\nhelp and picked the vegetables in the garden and took them in to the\ncook.",
    "You know spinach and lettuce and things like that and\u2014er\u2014I\nsuppose they just made a mistake not knowing much about growing\n\n\fvegetables.",
    "I think they said at the inquest or whatever they had\nafterwards that it was a mistake that anyone could make because the\nspinach or the sorrel leaves were growing near the Digi\u2014Digitwhatnot\nyou see so I suppose they just took a great handful of both leaves\npossibly in a bunch together.",
    "Anyway it was very sad because Granny\nsaid she was a very goodlooking girl with golden hair and all that you\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she used to go up to London every week Naturally she\u2019d have\nto have a day off.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",

    "She had one or two friends there you know.",
    "The military camp it\nwas.\u201d\n\u201cWas she really a spy\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t think so.",

    "It wasn\u2019t in the last war.",

    "Years before 1914.",

    "\u201cI\u2019ll play \u2018The Rain on the Roof\u2019 \u201d said Tuppence who had had this\nChopin memory revived in her by the piano tuner\u2019s execution of one of\n\n\fthe other preludes.",
    "Then she dropped into some chords and began\nplaying the accompaniment to a song humming it first and then\nmurmuring the words as well.",
    "Where has my true love gone aroaming\nWhere has my true love gone from me\nHigh in the woods the birds are calling.",
    "When will my true love come back to me\n\u201cI\u2019m playing it in the wrong key I believe\u201d said Tuppence \u201cbut at\nany rate the piano\u2019s all right again now.",

    "\u201cTrue love Yes I\u2019m thinking of that perhaps as a sign.",
    "Perhaps I\u2019d better go out and do something with Truelove.\u201d\nShe put on her thick shoes and a pullover and went out into the\ngarden.",
    "Truelove had been pushed not back into his former home in KK\nbut into the empty stable.",
    "Tuppence took him out pulled him to the top\nof the grass slope gave him a sharp flick with the duster she had brought\nout with her to remove the worst of the cobwebs which still adhered in\nmany places got into Truelove placed her feet on the pedals and\ninduced Truelove to display his paces as well as he could in his condition\nof general age and wear.",
    "\u201cNow my true love\u201d she said \u201cdown the hill with you and not too\nfast.\u201d\nShe removed her feet from the pedals and placed them in a position\nwhere she could brake with them when necessary.",
    "Truelove was not inclined to go very fast in spite of the advantage to\nhim of having only to go by weight down the hill.",
    "However the slope\nincreased in steepness suddenly.",
    "Truelove increased his pace Tuppence\napplied her feet as brakes rather more sharply and she and Truelove\narrived together at a rather more uncomfortable portion than usual of the\nmonkey puzzle at the bottom of the hill.",
    "\u201cMost painful\u201d said Tuppence excavating herself.",
    "Having extricated herself from the pricking of various portions of the\nmonkey puzzle Tuppence brushed herself down and looked around her.",
    "She had come to a thick bit of shrubbery leading up the hill in the\nopposite direction.",
    "There were rhododendron bushes here and\nhydrangeas.",
    "It would look Tuppence thought very lovely later in the\nyear.",
    "At the moment there was no particular beauty about it it was a\nmere thicket.",
    "However she did seem to notice that there had once been a\npathway leading up between the various flower bushes and shrubs.",
    "Everything was much grown together now but you could trace the\ndirection of the path.",
    "Tuppence broke off a branch or two pressed her\nway through the first bushes and managed to follow the hill.",
    "The path\nwent winding up.",
    "It was clear that nobody had ever cleared it or walked\ndown it for years.",
    "\u201cI wonder where it takes one\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cThere must be a\nreason for it.\u201d\nPerhaps she thought as the path took a couple of sharp turns in\nopposite directions making a zigzag and making Tuppence feel that she\nknew exactly what Alice in Wonderland had meant by saying that a path\nwould suddenly shake itself and change direction.",
    "There were fewer\nbushes there were laurels now possibly fitting in with the name given to\nthe property and then a rather stony difficult narrow path wound up\nbetween them.",
    "It came very suddenly to four mosscovered steps leading\nup to a kind of niche made of what had once been metal and later seemed\nto have been replaced by bottles.",
    "A kind of shrine and in it a pedestal\nand on this pedestal a stone figure very much decayed.",
    "It was the figure\nof a boy with a basket on his head.",
    "A feeling of recognition came to\nTuppence.",
    "\u201cThis is the sort of thing you could date a place with\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s\nvery like the one Aunt Sarah had in her garden.",
    "She had a lot of laurels\ntoo.\u201d\nHer mind went back to Aunt Sarah whom she had occasionally\nvisited as a child.",
    "She had played herself she remembered a game called\nRiver Horses.",
    "For River Horses you took your hoop out.",
    "Tuppence it\nmay be said had been six years old at the time.",
    "Her hoop represented the\nhorses.",
    "White horses with manes and flowing tails.",
    "In Tuppence\u2019s\nimagination with that you had gone across a green rather thick patch of\ngrass and you had then gone round a bed planted with pampas grass\n\n\fwaving feathery heads into the air up the same kind of a path and\nleaning there among some beech trees in the same sort of summerhouse\nniche was a figure and a basket.",
    "Tuppence when riding her winning\nhorses here had taken a gift always a gift you put in the basket on top of\nthe boy\u2019s head at the same time you said it was an offering and you\nmade a wish.",
    "The wish Tuppence remembered was nearly always to\ncome true.",
    "\u201cBut that\u201d said Tuppence sitting down suddenly on the top step of\nthe flight she had been climbing \u201cthat of course was because I cheated\nreally.",
    "I mean I wished for something that I knew was almost sure to\nhappen and then I could feel that my wish had come true and it really\nwas a magic.",
    "It was a proper offering to a real god from the past.",
    "Though\nit wasn\u2019t a god really it was just a podgylooking little boy.",
    "Ah well\u2014\nwhat fun it is all the things one used to invent and believe in and play\nat.\u201d\nShe sighed went down the path again and found her way to the\nmysteriously named KK.",
    "KK looked in just the same mess as ever.",
    "Mathilde was still looking\nforlorn and forsaken but two more things attracted Tuppence\u2019s attention.",
    "They were in porcelain\u2014porcelain stools with the figures of white swans\ncurled round them.",
    "One stool was dark blue and the other stool was pale\nblue.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d said Tuppence \u201cI\u2019ve seen things like that before when I\nwas young.",
    "Yes they used to be on verandas.",
    "One of my other aunts had\nthem I think.",
    "We used to call them Oxford and Cambridge.",
    "Very much\nthe same.",
    "I think it was ducks\u2014no it was swans they had round them.",
    "And then there was the same sort of queer thing in the seat a sort of hole\nthat was like a letter S. The sort of thing you could put things into.",
    "Yes I\nthink I\u2019ll get Isaac to take these two stools out of here and give them a\ngood wash and then we\u2019ll have them on the loggia or lodger as he will\ninsist on calling it though the veranda comes more natural to me.",
    "We\u2019ll\nput them on that and enjoy them when the good weather comes.\u201d\nShe turned and started to run towards the door.",
    "Her foot caught in\nMathilde\u2019s obtrusive rocker\u2014\n\u201cOh dear\u201d said Tuppence \u201cnow what have I done\u201d\n\n\fWhat she had done was to catch her foot in the dark blue porcelain\nstool and it rolled down on to the floor and smashed in two pieces.",
    "\u201cOh dear\u201d said Tuppence \u201cnow I\u2019ve really killed Oxford I suppose.",
    "We shall have to make do with Cambridge.",
    "I don\u2019t think you could stick\nOxford together again.",
    "The pieces are too difficult.\u201d\nShe sighed and wondered what Tommy was doing.",
    "II\nTommy was sitting exchanging memories with some old friends.",

    "\u201cI hear\nyou and your what\u2019shername Prudence\u2014no you had a nickname for\nher Tuppence that\u2019s right\u2014yes I hear you\u2019ve gone to live in the\ncountry.",

    "They said it was very unfair and a very stupid\nthing to have and that anyway they thought it was really a most\ndisgraceful thing to go on having nowadays because you had to say if\nyou had children and if you were married or if you were not married but\ndid have children and things like that.",
    "You had to put down a lot of very\ndifficult particulars and you didn\u2019t think it was nice.",

    "Wonder if he ever talked to\na policeman about them.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou mean Alexander\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014And perhaps because of that he talked too much.",
    "He had to\ndie.\u201d\n\u201cA lot depends on Alexander doesn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cWe do know when Alexander died because of his grave here.",

    "Would anybody really come to\nescort her this afternoon and take her to the PPC Was there any such\nthing really as the PPC or was it a nickname of some kind that the\nchildren had invented Anyway it might be fun Tuppence thought to sit\nwaiting in case someone came.",

    "Perhaps just as well but she did not think that either Janet Bert or\nClarence was likely to be a danger to her.",
    "The walk took about twenty\nminutes.",
    "When the red building was reached they went through the gate\nup to the door and were received by a stout woman of about seventy.",

    "This way.",
    "Yes.",
    "None of you need wait unless you\nlike you know.\u201d\n\u201cOh I think the boys will be very disappointed if they didn\u2019t wait to\nhear a little about what all this is about\u201d said Janet.",
    "\u201cWell I think you know there are not so very many of us here.",
    "Perhaps it would be better for Mrs. Beresford not so worrying if there\nweren\u2019t too many of us.",
    "I wonder Janet if you would just go into the\nkitchen and tell Mollie that we are quite ready for tea to be brought in\nnow.\u201d\nTuppence had not really come for tea but she could hardly say so.",
    "Tea appeared rather rapidly.",
    "It was excessively weak it was served with\nsome biscuits and some sandwiches with a rather nasty type of paste in\nbetween them with an extra fishy taste.",
    "Then they sat around and seemed\nslightly at a loss.",
    "An old man with a beard who looked to Tuppence as though he was\nabout a hundred came and sat firmly by her.",

    "Not that\nany of your memories would go back as far as that.",
    "But one wonders\nperhaps if you could have heard things you know from your elderly\nrelations.\u201d\n\u201cAh that\u2019s right\u201d said the old man \u201cthat\u2019s right.",
    "Heard a lot I did\nfrom my Uncle Len.",
    "Yes ah he was a great chap was Uncle Len.",

    "Yes a bad show\nthat.",
    "What you call one of those fakists\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFascists\u201d said one of the elderly ladies a rather prim one with grey\nhair and a lace fichu rather the worse for wear round her neck.",

    "All sorts of things like that.",
    "Someone called Mosley\nstarted it all.\u201d\n\u201cBut in the first war there was a girl called Mary Jordan wasn\u2019t\nthere\u201d said Tuppence wondering if this was a wise thing to say or not.",
    "\u201cAh yes.",
    "Said to be quite a good looker you know.",
    "Yes.",
    "Got hold of\nsecrets out of the sailors and the soldiers.\u201d\nA very old lady piped up in a thin voice.",

    "She wants to hear where that thing there was all the\nfuss about was hidden don\u2019t you And all about it.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds very interesting\u201d said Tuppence cheering up.",
    "\u201cSomething was hidden\u201d\n\u201cAh yes long before my time it was but I heard all about it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Before 1914.",

    "But yes I think I\u2019ve\ngot a few ideas for dealing with things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell there is a lot of legend I think going on about something that\nwas once hidden here and was a secret connected with the 1914 war or\neven before it.\u201d\n\u201cWell we know that already don\u2019t we\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI mean\nwe\u2019ve been briefed to know that.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Well there are a few old tales still going around the village\nhere.",
