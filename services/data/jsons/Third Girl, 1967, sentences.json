    "Agatha Christie  Third Girl\nCHAPTER ONE\nHERCULE POIROT was sitting at the breakfast table.",
    "At his right hand was a steaming cup of\nchocolate.",
    "He had always had a sweet tooth.",
    "To accompany the chocolate was a brioche.",
    "It went agreeably with chocolate.",
    "He nodded his approval.",
    "This was from the fourth shop he had tried.",
    "It was a Danish patisserie but\ninfinitely superior to the socalled French one near by.",
    "That had been nothing less than a fraud.",
    "He was satisfied gastronomically.",
    "His stomach was at peace.",
    "His mind also was at peace perhaps\nsomewhat too much so.",
    "He had finished his Magnum Opus an analysis of great writers of detective fiction.",
    "He had dared to\nspeak scathingly of Edgar Alien Poe he had complained of the lack of method or order in the romantic\noutpourings of Wilkie Collins had lauded to the skies two American authors who were practically\nunknown and had in various other ways given honour where honour was due and sternly withheld it\nwhere he considered it was not.",
    "He had seen the volume through the press had looked upon the results\nand apart from a really incredible number of printers errors pronounced that it was good.",
    "He had\nenjoyed this literary achievement and enjoyed the vast amount of reading he had had to do had enjoyed\nsnorting with disgust as he flung a book across the floor though always remembering to rise pick it up\nand dispose of it tidily in the wastepaper basket and had enjoyed appreciatively nodding his head on\nthe rare occasions when such approval was justified.",
    "And now He had had a pleasant interlude of relaxation very necessary after his intellectual labour.",
    "But\none could not relax for ever one had to go on to the next thing.",
    "Unfortunately he had no idea what the\nnext thing might be.",
    "Some further literary accomplishment He thought not.",
    "Do a thing well then leave it alone.",
    "That was his maxim.",
    "The truth of the matter was he was bored.",
    "All\nthis strenuous mental activity in which he had been indulgingthere had been too much of it.",
    "It had got\nhim into bad habits it had made him restless.",
    "Vexatious He shook his head and took another sip of chocolate.",
    "The door opened and his welltrained servant George entered.",
    "His manner was deferential and slightly\napologetic.",
    "He coughed and murmured A \u2014 he paused \u2014 a \u2014 young lady has called.",
    "Poirot\nlooked at him with surprise and mild distaste.",
    "I do not see people at this hour he said reprovingly.",
    "No sir agreed George.",
    "Master and servant looked at each other.",
    "Communication was sometimes fraught with difficulties for them.",
    "By inflexion or innuendo or a certain\nchoice of words George would signify that there was something that might be elicited if the right question\nwas asked.",
    "Poirot considered what the right question in this case might be.",
    "She is goodlooking this young lady he enquired carefully.",
    "In my view \u2014 no sir but there is no accounting for tastes.",
    "Poirot considered this reply.",
    "He\nremembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase  young lady.",
    "George was a delicate social recorder.",
    "He had been uncertain of the visitors status but had given her the\nbenefit of the doubt.",
    "You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than let us say a young person I think so sir\nthough it is not always easy to tell nowadays.",
    "George spoke with genuine regret.",
    "Did she give a reason for wishing to see me She said   George pronounced the words with some\nreluctance apologising for them in advance as it were that she wanted to consult you about a murder\nshe might have committed.",
    "Hercule Poirot stared.",
    "His eyebrows rose.",
    "Might have committed Does\nshe not know That is what she said sir.",
    "Unsatisfactory but possibly interesting said Poirot.",
    "It mighthave been a joke sir said George dubiously.",
    "Anything is possible I suppose conceded Poirot But one would hardly think   He lifted his cup.",
    "Show her in after five minutes.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "George withdrew.",
    "Poirot finished the last sip of chocolate.",
    "He pushed aside his cup and rose to his feet.",
    "He walked to the fireplace and adjusted his moustaches\ncarefully in the mirror over the chimney piece.",
    "Satisfied he returned to his chair and awaited the arrival of\nhis visitor.",
    "He did not know exactly what to expect.",
    "He had hoped perhaps for something nearer to his own estimate of female attraction.",
    "The outworn\nphrase beauty in distress had occurred to him.",
    "He was disappointed when George returned ushering in\nthe visitor inwardly he shook his head and sighed.",
    "Here was no beauty  and no noticeable distress\neither.",
    "Mild perplexity would seem nearer the mark.",
    "Pah thought Poirot disgustedly.",
    "These girls Do they not even try to make something of themselves Well made up attractively dressed\nhair that has been arranged by a good hairdresser then perhaps she might pass.",
    "But now His visitor\nwas a girl of perhaps twentyodd.",
    "Long straggly hair of indeterminate colour strayed over her shoulders.",
    "Her eyes which were large bore a\nvacant expression and were of a greenish blue.",
    "She wore what were presumably the chosen clothes of her generation.",
    "Black high leather boots white\nopenwork woollen stockings of doubtful cleanliness a skimpy skirt and a long and sloppy pullover of\nheavy wool.",
    "Anyone of Poirots age and generation would have had only one desire.",
    "To drop the girl into\na bath as soon as possible.",
    "He had often felt this same reaction walking along the streets.",
    "There were hundreds of girls looking exactly the same.",
    "They all looked dirty.",
    "And yet  a contradiction in terms  this one had the look of having been recently drowned and pulled\nout of a river.",
    "Such girls he reflected were not perhaps really dirty.",
    "They merely took enormous care\n\n\fand pains to look so.",
    "He rose with his usual politeness shook hands drew out a chair.",
    "You demanded to see me mademoiselle  Sit down I pray of you.",
    "Oh said the girl in a slightly\nbreathless voice.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "Eh bien said Poirot.",
    "She hesitated.",
    "I think Id\u2014rather stand.",
    "The large eyes continued to stare doubtfully.",
    "As you please.",
    "Poirot resumed his seat and looked at her.",
    "He waited.",
    "The girl shuffled her feet.",
    "She\nlooked down on them then up again at Poirot.",
    "You \u2014 you are Hercule Poirot Assuredly.",
    "In what way can I be of use to you Oh well its rather\ndifficult.",
    "I mean \u2014  Poirot felt that she might need perhaps a little assistance.",
    "He said helpfully My\nmanservant told me that you wanted to consult me because you thought you might have committed a\nmurder.",
    "Is that correct The girl nodded.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Surely that is not a matter that admits of any\ndoubt.",
    "You must know yourself whether you have committed a murder or not.",
    "Well I dont know quite\nhow to put it.",
    "I mean \u2014  Come now said Poirot kindly.",
    "Sit down.",
    "Relax the muscles.",
    "Tell me all about it.",
    "I dont\nthink \u2014 oh dear I dont know how to \u2014 You see its all so difficult.",
    "Ive \u2014 Ive changed my mind.",
    "I dont want to be rude but \u2014 well I think Id better go.",
    "Come now.",
    "Courage.",
    "No I cant.",
    "I thought I could come and \u2014 and ask you ask you what I ought to do \u2014 but I\ncant you see.",
    "Its all so different from \u2014  From what Im awfully sorry and I really dont want to be\nrude but \u2014  She breathed an enormous sigh looked at Poirot looked away and suddenly blurted out\nYoure too old.",
    "Nobody told me you were so old.",
    "I really dont want to be rude but \u2014 there it is.",
    "Youre too old.",
    "Im really very sorry.",
    "She turned abruptly and blundered out of the room rather like a desperate moth in\nlamplight.",
    "Poirot his mouth open heard the bang of the front door.",
    "He ejaculated Non fun nom cfun nom...\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE telephone rang.",
    "Hercule Poirot did not even seem aware of the fact.",
    "It rang with shrill and insistent persistence.",
    "George entered the room and stepped towards it turning a questioning glance towards Poirot.",
    "Poirot gestured with his hand.",
    "Leave it he said.",
    "George obeyed leaving the room again.",
    "The telephone contined to ring.",
    "The shrill irritating noise continued.",
    "Suddenly it stopped.",
    "After a minute or\ntwo however it commenced to ring again.",
    "Ah Sapristi That must be a woman  undoubtedly a woman.",
    "He sighed rose to his feet and came to\nthe instrument.",
    "He picked up the receiver.",
    "Allo he said.",
    "Are you  is that M. Poirot I myself.",
    "Its Mrs. Oliver  your voice sounds different.",
    "I didnt\nrecognise it at first.",
    "Bonjour Madame \u2014 you are well I hope Oh Im all right.",
    "Ariadne Olivers\nvoice came through in its usual cheerful accents.",
    "The wellknown detective story writer and Hercule\nPoirot were on friendly terms.",
    "Its rather early to ring you up but I want to ask you a favour.",
    "Yes It is the annual dinner of our\nDetective Authors Club I wondered if you would come and be our Guest Speaker this year.",
    "It would be very very sweet of you if you would.",
    "When is this Next month \u2014 the twentythird.",
    "A\ndeep sigh came over the telephone.",
    "Alas I am too old.",
    "Too old What on earth do you mean\nYoure not old at all.",
    "You think not Of course not.",
    "Youll be wonderful.",
    "You can tell us lots of lovely stories about real crimes.",
    "And who will want to listen Everyone.",
    "They\u2014M.",
    "Poirot is there anything the matter Has something happened You sound upset.",
    "Yes I am\nupset.",

    "But tell me about it.",
    "Why should I make a fuss Why\nshouldnt you Youd better come and tell me all about it.",
    "When will you come This afternoon.",
    "Come\nand have tea with me.",
    "Afternoon tea I do not drink it.",
    "Then you can have coffee.",
    "It is not the time\nof day I usually drink coffee.",
    "Chocolate With whipped cream on top Or a tisane.",
    "You love sipping\ntisanes.",
    "Or lemonade.",
    "Or orangeade.",
    "Or would you like decaffeinated coffee if I can get it   Ah pa\npar exemple It is an abomination.",
    "One of those sirups you like so much.",
    "I know Ive got half a bottle of Ribena in the cupboard.",
    "What is Ribena.",
    "Blackcurrant flavour.",
    "Indeed one has to hand it to you\nYou really do try Madame.",
    "I am touched by your solicitude.",
    "I will accept with pleasure to drink a cup of\nchocolate this afternoon.",
    "Good.",
    "And then youll tell me all about whats upset you.",
    "She rang off.",
    "11 Poirot considered for a moment.",
    "Then he dialled a number.",
    "Presently he said Mr. Goby Hercule\nPoirot here.",
    "Are you very fully occupied at this moment Middling said the voice of Mr.\nGoby.",
    "Middling to fair.",
    "But to oblige you.",
    "Monsieur Poirot if youre in a hurry as you usually are well I wouldnt say that my young men couldnt manage mostly whats on hand at present.",
    "Of course\ngood boys arent as easy to get as they used to be.",
    "Think too much of themselves nowadays.",
    "Think they\nknow it all before theyve started to learn.",
    "But there\n\n\fCant expect old heads on young shoulders.",
    "Ill be pleased to put myself at your disposal M. Poirot.",
    "Maybe I can put one or two of the better lads\non the job.",
    "I suppose its the usual  collecting information He nodded his head and listened whilst\nPoirot went into details of exactly what he wanted done.",
    "When he had finished with Mr. Goby Poirot\nrang up Scotland Yard where in due course he got through to a friend of his.",
    "When he in turn had listened\nto Poirots requirements he replied\nDont want much do you Any murder anywhere.",
    "Time place and victim unknown.",
    "Sounds a bit of a\nwild goose chase if you ask me old boy.",
    "He added disapprovingly You dont seem to know\nanything III At 4.15 that afternoon Poirot sat in Mrs.\nOlivers drawingroom sipping appreciatively at a large cup of chocolate topped with foaming whipped\ncream which his hostess had just placed on a small table beside him.",
    "She added a small plate full oflangue\nde chats biscuits.",
    "Chere Madame what kindness.",
    "He looked over his cup with faint surprise at Mrs. Olivers coiffure and\nalso at her new wallpaper.",
    "Both were new to him.",
    "The last time he had seen Mrs. Oliver her hair style had been plain and severe.",
    "It now displayed a\nrichness of coils and twists arranged in intricate patterns all over her head.",
    "Its prolific luxury was he\nsuspected largely artificial.",
    "He debated in his mind how many switches of hair might unexpectedly fall off\nif Mrs. Oliver was to get suddenly excited as was her wont.",
    "As for the wallpaper.",
    "These cherries \u2014 they are new he waved a teaspoon.",
    "It was he felt rather like being in a cherry\norchard.",
    "Are there too many of them do you think said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "So hard to fell beforehand with\nwallpaper.",
    "Do you think my old was better Poirot cast his mind back dimly to what he seemed to\nremember as large quantities of bright coloured tropical birds in a forest.",
    "He felt inclined to remark Plus\npa change plus cest la meme chose but restrained himself.",
    "And now said Mrs. Oliver as her guest finally replaced his cup on its saucer and sat back with a sigh\nof satisfaction wiping remnants of foaming cream from his moustache what is all this about That I can\ntell you very simply.",
    "This morning a girl came to see me.",
    "I suggested she might make an appointment.",
    "One has ones routine you comprehend.",
    "She sent back word that she wanted to see me at once because\nshe thought she might have committed a murder.",
    "What an odd thing to say.",
    "Didnt she know\nPrecisely Cest mom so I instructed George to show her in.",
    "She stood there\nShe refused to sit down.",
    "She just stood there staring at me.",
    "She seemed quite half witted.",
    "I tried to\nencourage her.",
    "Then suddenly she said that shed changed her mind.",
    "She said she didnt want to be rude\nbut that  what do you think  but that I was too old... Mrs. Oliver hastened to utter soothing\nwords.",
    "Oh well girls are like that.",
    "Anyone over thirtyfive they think is half dead.",
    "Theyve no sense.",
    "girls you must realise that.",
    "It wounded me said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Well I shouldnt worry about it if I were you.",
    "Of course it was a very rude thing to say.",
    "That does not\nmatter.",
    "And it is not only my feelings.",
    "I am worried.",
    "Yes I am worried.",
    "Well I should forget all about it\nif I were you advised Mrs. Oliver comfortably.",
    "You do not understand.",
    "I am worried about this girl.",
    "She came to me for help.",
    "Then she decided that I\n\n\fwas too old.",
    "Too old to be of any use to her.",
    "She was wrong of course that goes without saying and\nthen she just ran away.",
    "But I tell you that girl needs help.",
    "I dont suppose she does really said Mrs.\nOliver soothingly.",
    "Girls make a fuss about things.",
    "No.",
    "You are wrong.",
    "She needs help.",
    "You dont\nthink she really has committed a murder Why not She said she had.",
    "Yes but  Mrs. Oliver\nstopped.",
    "She said she might have she said slowly.",
    "But what can she possibly mean by that Exactly.",
    "It does not make sense.",
    "Who did she murder or\ndid she think she murdered Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "And why did she murder someone Again Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Of course it could be all sorts of things.",
    "Mrs. Oliver began to brighten as she set her ever prolific\nimagination to work.",
    "She could have run over someone in her car and not stopped.",
    "She could have been\nassaulted by a man on a cliff and struggled with him and managed to push him over.",
    "She could have given someone the wrong medicine by mistake.",
    "She could have gone to one of those\npurple pill parties and had a fight with someone.",
    "She could have come to and found she had stabbed\nsomeone.",
    "She   Assez madame assez  But Mrs. Oliver was well away.",
    "She might have been a nurse in the\noperating theatre and administered the wrong anaesthetic of  she broke off suddenly anxious for\nclearer details.",
    "What did she look like Poirot considered for a moment.",
    "An Ophelia devoid of physical attraction.",
    "Oh dear said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I can almost see her when you say that.",
    "How queer.",
    "She is not\ncompetent said Poirot.",
    "That is how I see her.",
    "She is not one who can cope with difficulties.",
    "She is not one of those who can see\nbeforehand the danger that must come.",
    "She is one of whom others will look round and say We want a\nvictim.",
    "That one will do But Mrs. Oliver was no longer listening.",
    "She was clutching her rich coils of hair with both hands in a gesture with which Poirot was familiar.",
    "Wait she cried in a kind of agony.",
    "Wait Poirot waited his eyebrows raised.",
    "You didnt tell me her name said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She did not give it.",
    "Unfortunate I agree with you.",
    "Wait implored Mrs. Oliver again with the same\nagony.",
    "She relaxed her grip on her head and uttered a deep sigh.",
    "Hair detached itself from its bonds and\ntumbled over her shoulders a super imperial coil of hair detached itself completely and fell on the floor.",
    "Poirot picked it up and put it discreetly on the table.",
    "Now then said Mrs. Oliver suddenly restored to calm.",
    "She pushed in a hairpin or two and nodded\nher head while she thought.",
    "Who told this girl about you M.\nPoirot No one so far as I know.",
    "Naturally she had heard about me no doubt.",
    "Mrs. Oliver thought\nthat naturally was not the word at all.",
    "What was natural was that Poirot himself was sure that everyone\nhad always heard of him.",
    "Actually large numbers of people would only look at you blankly if the name of\nHercule Poirot was mentioned especially the younger generation.",
    "But how am I going to put that to\nhim thought Mrs. Oliver in such a way that it wont hurt his feelings I think youre wrong she said.",
    "Girls \u2014well girls and young men \u2014 they dont know very much about detectives and things like that.",
    "They dont hear about them.",
    "Everyone must have heard about Hercule Poirot said Poirot superbly.",
    "It was an article of belief for Hercule Poirot.",
    "But they are all so badly educated nowadays said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Really the only people whose names\nthey know are pop singers or Groups or disc jockeys \u2014 that sort of thing.",
    "If you need someone\nspecial I mean a doctor or a detective or a dentist\u2014well then I mean you would ask someone \u2014 ask\nwhos the right person to go to And then the other person says \u2014 My dear you must go to that\nabsolutely wonderful man in Queen Annes Street twists your legs three times round your head and\nyoure cured or All my diamonds were stolen and Henry would have been furious so I couldnt go to\nthe police but theres a simply uncanny detective most discreet and he got them back for me and Henry\nnever knew a thing.",
    "\u2014 Thats the way it happens all the time.",
    "Someone sent that girl to you.",
    "I doubt it\nvery much.",
    "You wouldnt know until you were told.",
    "And youre going to be told now.",
    "Its only just\ncome to me.",
    "sent that girl to you.",
    "Poirot stared.",
    "You But why did you not say so at once Because\nits only just come to me \u2014 when you spoke about Ophelia \u2014 long wetlooking hair and rather plain.",
    "It\nseemed a description of someone Id actually seen.",
    "Quite lately.",
    "And then it came to me who it was.",
    "Who is she I dont actually know her name but I can easily find out.",
    "We were talking \u2014 about\nprivate detectives and private eyes \u2014 and I spoke about you and some of the amazing things you had\ndone.",
    "And you gave her my address No of course I didnt.",
    "Id no idea she wanted a detective or\nanything like that.",
    "I thought we were just talking.",
    "But Id mentioned the name several times and of course it would be easy\nto look you up in the telephone book and just come along.",
    "Were you talking about murder Not that\nI can remember.",
    "I dont even know how we came to be talking about detectives \u2014 unless yes perhaps\nit was she who started the subject... Tell me then tell me all you can\u2014 even if you do not know her\nname tell me all you know about her.",
    "Well it was last weekend.",
    "I was staying with the Lorrimers.",
    "They\ndont come into it except that they took me over to some friends of theirs for drinks.",
    "There were several\npeople there\u2014and I didnt enjoy myself much because as you know I dont really like drink and so\npeople have to find a soft drink for me which is rather a bore for them.",
    "And then people say things to me\n you know  how much they like my books and how theyve been longing to meet me  and it all\nmakes me feel hot and bothered and rather silly.",
    "But I managed to cope more or less.",
    "And they say how much they love my awful detective Sven\nHjerson.",
    "If they knew how  hated him But my publisher always says Im not to say so.",
    "Anyway I\nsuppose the talk about detectives in real life grew out of all that and I talked a bit about you and this girl\nwas standing around listening.",
    "When you said an unattractive Ophelia it clicked somehow.",
    "I thought\nnow who does that remind me of And then it came to me Of course.",
    "The girl at the party that day.",
    "I\nrather think she belonged there unless Im confusing her with some other girl.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "With Mrs.\nOliver one always needed a lot of patience.",
    "Who were these people with whom you went to have drinks Trefusis I think unless it was Treherne.",
    "That sort of name  hes a tycoon.",
    "Rich.",

    "There was a foreign girl there too who sort of trots about\nafter the old boy.",
    "Goes up to London with him I believe and sees he doesnt get run over.",
    "Rather pretty she was.",
    "Poirot\nsorted out the information Mrs. Oliver had supplied him with feeling rather like a human computer.",
    "There lives then in the house Mr. and Mrs. Trefusis   Its not Trefusis  I remember now  Its\nRestarick.",
    "That is not at all the same type of name.",

    "And where does this girl whose name might just possibly be Norma live in\nLondon As Ive told you I dont really know anything about her.",
    "But you could find out Oh yes I\nexpect that would be quite easy.",
    "You are sure there was no talk no mention of an unexpected death\nDo you mean a death in London  or at the Restaricks home Either.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "Shall I see\nwhat I can rake up Mrs. Olivers eyes sparked with excitement.",
    "She was by now entering into the spirit of the thing.",
    "That would be very kind.",
    "Ill ring up the Lorrimers.",
    "Actually now would be quite a good time.",
    "She\nwent towards the telephone.",
    "I shall have to think of reasons and things  perhaps invent things She\nlooked towards Poirot rather doubtfully.",
    "But naturally.",
    "That is understood.",
    "You are a woman of imagination  you will have no difficulty.",
    "But not too fantastic you understand.",
    "Moderation.",
    "Mrs. Oliver flashed him an understanding glance.",
    "She dialled and asked for the number she wanted.",
    "Turning her head she hissed Have you got a pencil\nand paper something to write down names and addresses or places Poirot had already his notebook\narranged by his elbow and nodded his head reassuringly.",
    "Mrs. Oliver turned back to the receiver she held and launched herself into speech.",
    "Poirot listened attentively to one side of a telephone conversation.",
    "Hallo.",
    "Can I speak to  Oh its you Naomi.",
    "Ariadne Oliver here.",
    "Oh yes well it was rather a\ncrowd... Oh you mean the old boy... No you know I dont...",
    "Practically blind...",
    "I thought he was\ngoing up to London with the little foreign girl...",
    "Yes it must be rather worrying for them sometimes \u2014 but\nshe seems to manage him quite well... One of the things I rang up for was to ask you what the girls\naddress was\u2014 No the Restarick girl I mean \u2014 somewhere in South Ken isnt it Or was it\nKnightsbridge \nWell I promised her a book and I wrote down the address but of course Ive lost it as usual.",
    "I cant\neven remember her name.",
    "Is it Thora or Norma...",
    "Yes I thought it was Norma...",
    "Wait a minute Ill get\na pencil...",
    "Yes Im ready.",
    "67 Borodene Mansions...",
    "I know \u2014 that great block that looks rather like Wormwood Scrubs prison...",
    "Yes I believe the flats are very comfortable with central heating and everything... Who are the other two\ngirls she lives with.",
    "Friends others... or advertisements.",
    "Claudia ReeceHolland... her fathers the M.P.",
    "is he Whos the other one.",
    "No I suppse you wouldnt know \u2014 shes quite nice too I suppose... What do they all do They always\n\n\fseem to be secretaries dont they... Oh the other girls an interior decorator  you think  or to do\nwith an art gallery No Naomi of course I dont really want to know  one just wonders  what do all\nthe girls do nowadays  well its useful for me to know because of my books  one wants to keep up\nto date... What was it you told me about some boy friend...",
    "Yes but ones so helpless isnt one I mean\ngirls do just exactly as they like... does he look very awful Is he the unshaven dirty kind Oh that\nkind Brocade waistcoats and long curling chestnut hair  lying on his shoulders  yes so hard to tell\nwhether theyre girls or boys isnt it Yes they do look like Vandykes sometimes if theyre\ngoodlooking.",
    "What did you say That Andrew Restarick simply hates him...",
    "Yes men usually do... Mary\nRestarick... Well I suppose you do usually have rows with a stepmother.",
    "I expect she was quite\nthankful when the girl got a job in London.",
    "What do you mean about people saying things.",
    "Why couldnt they find out what was the matter with her... Who said...",
    "Yes but what did they hush\nup... Oh \u2014 a nurse \u2014 talked to the Jenners governess\nDo you mean her husband Oh I see\u2014 The doctors couldnt find out... No but people are so ill\nnatured.",
    "I do agree with you.",
    "These things are usually quite untrue... Oh gastric was it...",
    "But how\nridiculous.",
    "Do you mean people said whats his name \u2014 Andrew\u2014 You mean it would be easy with all\nthose weed killers about\u2014 Yes but why...",
    "I mean its not a case of some wife hes hated for years \u2014\nshes the second wife \u2014 and much younger than he is and goodlooking.",
    "Yes I suppose that could be \u2014 but why should the foreign girl want to either.",
    "You mean she might have resented things that Mrs. Restarick said to her... Shes quite an attractive little\nthing \u2014 I suppose Andrew might have taken a fancy to her \u2014 nothing serious of course \u2014 but it might\nhave annoyed Mary and then she might have pitched into the girl and \u2014  Out of the corner of her eye\nMrs. Oliver perceived Poirot signalling wildly to her.",
    "Just a moment darling said Mrs.\nOliver into the telephone.",
    "Its the baker.",
    "Poirot looked affronted.",
    "Hang on.",
    "She laid down the\nreceiver hurried across the room and backed Poirot into a breakfast nook.",
    "Yes she demanded breathlessly.",
    "A baker said Poirot with scorn.",
    "Me Well it was necessary to think of something quickly.",
    "What were you signalling about Did you\nunderstand what she   Poirot cut her short.",
    "You shall tell me presently.",
    "I know enough.",
    "What I want you to do is with your rapid powers of\nimprovisation to arrange some plausible pretext for me to visit the Restaricks  an old friend of yours\nshortly to be in the neighbourhood.",
    "Perhaps you could say   Leave it to me.",
    "Ill think of something.",
    "Shall you give a false name Certainly not.",
    "Let us at least try to keep it simple.",
    "Mrs. Oliver nodded\nand hurried back to the abandoned telephone.",
    "Naomi I cant remember what we were saying.",
    "Why does something always come to interrupt just\n\n\fwhen one has settled down to a nice gossip.",
    "I cant even remember now what I rang you up for to begin\nwith Oh yes  that child Thoras address  Norma I mean  and you gave it to me.",
    "But there was\nsomething else I wanted to  oh I remember.",
    "An old friend of mine.",
    "A most fascinating little man.",
    "Actually I was talking about him the other day down there.",
    "Hercule Poirot his name is.",
    "Hes going to be\nstaying quite close to the Restaricks and he is most tremendously anxious to meet old Sir Roderick.",
    "He\nknows a lot about him and has a terrific admiration for him and for some wonderful discovery of his in\nthe war  or some scientific thing he did  anyway he is very anxious to call upon him and present his\nrespects thats how he put it.",
    "Will that be all right do you think\nWill you warn them Yes hell probably just turn up out of the blue.",
    "Tell them to make him tell them\nsome wonderful espionage stories... Hewhat Oh your mowers Yes of course you must go.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "She put back the receiver and sank down in an armchair.",
    "Goodness how exhausting.",
    "Was\nthat all right Not bad said Poirot.",
    "I thought Id better pin it all to the old boy.",
    "Then youll get to see the lot which I suppose is what you\nwant.",
    "And one can always be vague about scientific subjects if one is a woman and you can think up\nsomething more definite that sounds probable by the time you arrive.",
    "Now do you want to hear what she\nwas telling me There has been gossip I gather.",
    "About the health of Mrs. Restarick Thats it.",
    "It\nseems she had some kind of mysterious illness \u2014 gastric in nature \u2014 and the doctors were puzzled.",
    "They sent her into hospital and she got quite all right but there didnt seem any real cause to account for\nit.",
    "And she went home and it all began to start again \u2014 and again the doctors were puzzled.",
    "And then\npeople began to talk.",
    "A rather irresponsible nurse started it and her sister told a neighbour and the\nneighbour went out on daily work and told someone else and how queer it all was.",
    "And then people\nbegan saying that her husband must be trying to poison her.",
    "The sort of thing people always say\u2014but in\nthis case it really didnt seem to make sense.",
    "And then Naomi and I wondered about the au pair girl\u2014at\nleast she isnt exactly an au pair girl shes a kind of secretary companion to the old boy  so really there\nisnt any kind of reason why she should administer weed killer to Mrs.\nRestarick.",
    "I heard you suggesting a few.",
    "Well there is usually something possible...",
    "Murder\ndesired... said Poirot thoughtfully...",
    "But not yet committed.",
    "CHAPTER THREE\nMRS. OLIVER drove into the inner court of Borodene Mansions.",
    "There were six cars filling the parking space.",
    "As Mrs. Oliver hesitated one of the cars reversed out and\ndrove away.",
    "Mrs. Oliver hurried neatly into the vacant space.",
    "She descended banged the door and stood looking up to the sky.",
    "It was a recent block occupying a\nspace left by the havoc of a land mine in the last war.",
    "It might Mrs. Oliver thought have been lifted en\nbloc from the Great West Road and first deprived of some such legend as SLYLARKS FEATHER\nRAZOR BLADES have been deposited as a block of flats in situ.",
    "It looked extremely functional and\nwhoever had built it had obviously scorned any ornamental additions.",
    "It was a busy time.",
    "Cars and people were going in and out of the courtyard as the days work came to a\nclose.",
    "Mrs. Oliver glanced down at her wrist.",
    "Ten minutes to seven.",
    "About the right time as far as she could judge.",
    "The kind of time when girls in jobs\nmight be presumed to have returned either to renew their makeup change their clothes to tight exotic\n\n\fpants or whatever their particular addiction was and go out again or else to settle down to home life and\nwash their smalls and their stockings.",
    "Anyway quite a sensible time to try.",
    "The block was exactly the\nsame on the east and the west with big swing doors set in the centre.",
    "Mrs. Oliver chose the left hand side but immediately found that she was wrong.",
    "All this side were numbers from 100 to 200.",
    "She crossed over to the other side.",
    "No.",
    "67 was on the sixth floor.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver pressed the button of the lift.",
    "The doors opened like a yawning mouth with a menacing clash.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver hurried into the yawning cavern.",
    "She was always afraid of modern lifts.",
    "Crash.",
    "The doors came to again.",
    "The lift went up.",
    "It stopped almost immediately that was frightening\ntoo.",
    "Mrs. Oliver scuttled out like a frightened rabbit.",
    "She looked up at the wall and went along the right hand passage.",
    "She came to a door marked 67 in\nmetal numbers affixed to the centre of the door.",
    "The numeral 7 detached itself and fell on her feet as she\narrived.",
    "This place doesnt like me said Mrs.\nOliver to herself as she winced with pain and picked the number up gingerly and affixed it by its spike to\nthe door again.",
    "She pressed the bell.",
    "Perhaps everyone was out.",
    "However the door opened almost at once.",
    "A tall handsome girl stood in the doorway.",
    "She was wearing\na dark wellcut suit with a very short skirt a white silk shirt and was very well shod.",
    "She had sweptup\ndark hair good but discreet makeup and for some reason was slightly alarming to Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Oh said Mrs. Oliver galvanising herself to say the right thing.",
    "Is Miss Restarick in by any chance\nNo Im sorry shes out.",
    "Can I give her a message Mrs. Oliver said Oh again\u2014before proceeding.",
    "She made a play of action by producing a parcel rather untidily done up in brown paper.",
    "I promised her\na book she explained.",
    "One of mine that she hadnt read.",
    "I hope Ive remembered actually which it was.",
    "She wont be in soonI suppose I really couldnt say.",
    "I dont know what she is doing tonight.",
    "Oh.",
    "Are\nyou Miss ReeceHolland The girl looked slightly surprised.",
    "Yes I am.",
    "Ive met your father said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She went on Im Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I write books she added in the usual guilty style in which she invariably\nmade such announcement.",
    "Wont you come in Mrs. Oliver accepted the invitation and Claudia ReeceHolland led her into a\nsittingroom.",
    "All the rooms of the flats were papered the same with an artificial raw wood pattern.",
    "Tenants could then display their modern pictures or apply any forms of decoration they fancied.",
    "There\nwas a foundation of modern builtin furniture cupboard bookshelves and so on a large settee and a\npullout type of table.",
    "Personal bits and pieces could be added by the tenants.",
    "There were also signs of\nindividuality displayed here by a gigantic Harlequin pasted on one wall and a stencil of a monkey\nswinging from branches of palm fronds on another wall.",
    "Im sure Norma will be thrilled to get your book Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Wont you have a drink Sherry Gin\nThis girl had the brisk manner of a really good secretary.",
    "Mrs. Oliver refused.",
    "Youve got a splendid view up here she said looking out of the window and blinking a little as she got\nthe setting sun straight in her eyes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Not so funny when the lift goes out of order.",
    "I shouldnt have thought that lift would dare to go\nout of order.",
    "Its so \u2014 so \u2014robotlike.",
    "Recently installed but none the better for that said Claudia.",
    "It needs frequent adjusting and all that.",
    "Another girl came in talking as she entered.",
    "Claudia have you any idea where I put \u2014  She stopped looking at Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Claudia made a quick introduction.",
    "Frances Cary \u2014 Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Mrs.\nAriadne Oliver.",
    "Oh how exciting said Frances.",
    "She was a tall willowy girl with long black hair a heavily madeup dead white face and eyebrows and\neyelashes slightly slanted upwards \u2014 the effect heightened by mascara.",
    "She wore tight velvet pants and a\nheavy sweater.",
    "She was a complete contrast to the brisk and efficient Claudia.",
    "I brought a book Id promised Norma Restarick said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Oh \u2014 what a pity shes still in the country.",
    "Hasnt she come back There was quite definitely a\npause.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver thought the two girls exchanged a glance.",
    "I thought she had a job in London said Mrs. Oliver endeavouring to convey innocent surprise.",
    "Oh yes said Claudia.",
    "Shes in an interior decorating place.",
    "Shes sent down with patterns occasionally\nto places in the country She smiled.",
    "We live rather separate lives here.",
    "Come and go as we like \u2014 and\ndont usually leave messages.",
    "But I wont forget to give her your book when she does arrive.",
    "Nothing could have been easier than the\ncasual explanation.",
    "Mrs. Oliver rose.",
    "Well thank you very much.",
    "Claudia accompanied her to the door.",
    "I shall tell my\nfather Ive met you she said.",
    "Hes a great reader of detective stories.",
    "Closing the door she went back\ninto the sittingroom.",
    "The girl Frances was leaning against the window.",
    "Sorry she said.",
    "Did I boob Id just said that Norma was out.",
    "Frances shrugged her shoulders.",
    "I couldnt tell.",
    "Claudia where is that girl Why didnt she come back on Monday Where has she\ngone I cant imagine.",
    "She didnt stay on down with her people\n\n\fThats where she went for the weekend.",
    "No.",
    "I rang up actually to find out.",
    "I suppose it doesnt really\nmatter.",
    "All the same she is  well theres something queer about her.",
    "Shes not really queerer than anyone\nelse.",
    "But the opinion sounded uncertain.",
    "Oh yes she is said Frances.",
    "Sometimes she gives me the shivers.",
    "Shes not normal you know.",
    "She\nlaughed suddenly.",
    "Norma isnt normal You know she isnt Claudia although you wont admit it.",
    "Loyalty to your employer\nI suppose.",
    "CHAPTER FOUR\nHERCULE POIROT walked along the main street of Long Basing.",
    "That is if you can describe as a main street a street that is to all intents and purposes the only street\nwhich was the case in Long Basing.",
    "It was one of those villages that exhibit a tendency to length without\nbreadth.",
    "It had an impressive church with a tall tower and a yew tree of elderly dignity in its churchyard.",
    "It had its full quota of village shops disclosing much variety.",
    "It had two antique shops one mostly\nconsisting of stripped pine chimney pieces the other disclosing a full house of piled up ancient maps a\ngood deal of porcelain most of it chipped some wormeaten old oak chests shelves of glass some\nVictorian silver all somewhat hampered in display by lack of space.",
    "There were two cafes both rather\nnasty there was a basket shop quite delightful with a large variety of homemade wares there was a\npost officecumgreengrocer there was a drapers which dealt largely in millinery and also a shoe\ndepartment for children and a large miscellaneous selection of haberdashery of all kinds.",
    "There was a\nstationery and newspaper shop which also dealt in tobacco and sweets.",
    "There was a wool shop which\nwas clearly the aristocrat of the place.",
    "Two whitehaired severe women were in charge of shelves and\nshelves of knitting materials of every description.",
    "Also large quantities of dressmaking patterns and\nknitting patterns and which branched off into a counter for art needlework.",
    "What had lately been the\nlocal grocers had now blossomed into calling itself a supermarket complete with stacks of wire baskets\nand packaged materials of every cereal and cleaning material all in dazzling paper boxes.",
    "And there was\na small establishment with one small window with Lillah written across it in fancy letters a fashion display\nof one French blouse labelled Latest chic and a navy skirt and a purple striped jumper labelled\nseparates.",
    "These were displayed by being flung down as by a careless hand in the window.",
    "All of this Poirot observed with detached interest.",
    "Also contained within the limits of the village and facing\non the street were several small houses oldfashioned in style sometimes retaining Georgian purity more\noften showing some signs of Victorian improvement as a veranda bow window or a small\nconservatory.",
    "One or two houses had had a complete face lift and showed signs of claiming to be new\nand proud of it.",
    "There were also some delightful and decrepit oldworld cottages some pretending to be a hundred or so\nyears older than they were others completely genuine any added comforts of plumbing or such being\ncarefully hidden from any casual glance.",
    "Poirot walked gently along digesting all that he saw.",
    "If his impatient friend Mrs.\nOliver had been with him she would have immediately demanded why he was wasting time as the house\nto which he was bound was a quarter of a mile beyond the village limits.",
    "Poirot would have told her that\nhe was absorbing the local atmosphere that these things were sometimes important.",
    "At the end of the village there came an abrupt transition.",
    "On one side set back from the road was a row\nof newly built council houses a strip of green in front of them and a gay note set by each house having\nbeen given a different coloured front door.",
    "Beyond the council houses the sway of fields and hedges\nresumed its course interspersed now and then by the occasional desirable residences of a house agents\nlist with their own trees and gardens and a general air of reserve and of keeping themselves to\nthemselves.",
    "Ahead of him farther down the road Poirot descried a house the top story of which displayed an unusual\nnote of bulbous construction.",
    "Something had evidently been tacked on up there not so many years ago.",
    "This no doubt was the Mecca towards which his feet were bent.",
    "He arrived at a gate to which the nameplate Crosshedges was attached.",
    "He surveyed the house.",
    "It was a\nconventional house dating perhaps to the beginning of the century.",
    "It was neither beautiful nor ugly.",
    "Commonplace was perhaps the word to describe it.",
    "The garden was more attractive than the house and\nhad obviously been the subject of a great deal of care and attention in its time though it had been allowed\nto fall into disarray.",
    "It still had smooth green lawns plenty of flower beds carefully planted areas of\nshrubs to display a certain landscape effect.",
    "It was all in good order.",
    "A gardener was certainly employed\nin this garden Poirot reflected.",
    "A personal interest was perhaps also taken since he noted in a corner near the house a woman bending\nover one of the flower beds tying up dahlias he thought.",
    "Her head showed as a bright circle of pure gold\ncolour.",
    "She was tall slim but squareshouldered.",
    "He unlatched the gate passed through and walked up towards the house.",
    "The woman turned her head and then straightened herself turning towards him enquiringly.",
    "She remained standing waiting for him to speak some garden twine hanging from her left hand.",
    "She\nlooked he noted puzzled.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "Poirot very foreign took off his hat with a flourish and bowed.",
    "Her eyes rested on his moustaches with a\nkind of fascination.",
    "Mrs. Restarick Yes.",
    "I   I hope that I do not derange you Madame.",
    "A faint smile touched her\nlips.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Are you \u2014  I have permitted myself to pay a visit on you.",
    "A friend of mine Mrs.\nAriadne Oliver \u2014  Oh of course.",
    "I know who you must be.",
    "Monsieur Poiret.",
    "Monsieur Poirot he\ncorrected her with an emphasis on the last syllable.",
    "Hercule Poirot at your service.",
    "I was passing through this neighbourhood and I ventured to call upon\nyou here in the hope that I might be allowed to pay my respects to Sir Roderick Horsefield.",
    "Yes.",
    "Naomi Lorrimer told us you might turnup.",
    "I hope it is not inconvenient Oh it is not inconvenient at\nall.",
    "Ariadne Oliver was here last weekend.",
    "She came over with the Lorrimers.",
    "Her books are most amusing\narent they But perhaps you dont find detective stories amusing.",
    "You are a detective yourself arent you \u2014 a real one I am all that there is of the most real said\nHercule Poirot.",
    "He noticed that she repressed a smile.",
    "He studied her more closely.",
    "She was handsome in a rather artificial fashion.",
    "Her golden hair was stiffly arranged.",
    "He wondered whether she might not at heart be secretly unsure of\nherself whether she were not carefully playing the part of the English lady absorbed in her garden.",
    "He\nwondered a little what her social background might have been.",
    "You have a very fine garden here he said.",
    "You like gardens Not as the English like gardens.",
    "You have for a garden a special talent in England.",
    "It\nmeans something to you that it does not to us.",
    "To French people you mean I am not French.",
    "I am\nBelgian.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "I believe that Mrs. Oliver mentioned that you were once with the Belgian Police\nForce That is so.",
    "Me I am an old Belgian police dog.",
    "He gave a polite little laugh and said waving\nhis hands But your gardens you English I admire.",
    "I sit at your feet The Latin races they like the formal\ngarden the gardens of the chateau of Versailles in miniature and also of course they invented the\npotager.",
    "Very important the potager.",
    "Here in England you have the potager but you got it from France\nand you do not love your potager as much as you love your flowers.",
    "Hein\nThat is so Yes I think you are right said Mary Restarick.",
    "Do come into the house.",
    "You came to see\nmy uncle.",
    "I came as you say to pay homage to Sir Roderick but I pay homage to you also Madame.",
    "Always I pay homage to beauty when I meet it.",
    "He bowed.",
    "She laughed with slight embarrassment.",
    "You mustnt pay me so many compliments.",
    "She led the way through an open french window and he\nfollowed her.",
    "I knew your uncle slightly in 1944.",
    "Poor dear hes getting quite an old man now.",
    "Hes very deaf Im\nafraid.",
    "It was long ago that I encountered him.",
    "He will probably have forgotten.",
    "It was a matter of espionage and of scientific developments of a certain\ninvention.",
    "We owed that invention to the ingenuity of Sir Roderick.",
    "He will be willing I hope to receive\nme.",
    "Oh Im sure hell love it said Mrs.\nRestarick.",
    "He has rather a dull life in some ways nowadays.",
    "I have to be so much in London  we are\nlooking for a suitable house there.",
    "She sighed and said Elderly people can be very difficult sometimes.",
    "I know3 said Poirot.",
    "Frequently I too am difficult.",
    "She laughed.",
    "Ah no M. Poirot come now you\nmustnt pretend youre old.",
    "Sometimes I am told so said Poirot.",
    "He sighed.",
    "By young girls he added mournfully.",
    "Thats very unkind of them.",
    "Its probably the sort of thing that our daughter would do she added.",
    "Ah you have a daughter Yes.",
    "At least she is my stepdaughter.",
    "I shall have much pleasure in\nmeeting her said Poirot politely.",
    "Oh well Im afraid she is not here.",
    "Shes in London.",
    "She works there.",
    "The young girls they all do jobs nowadays.",
    "Everybodys supposed to do a job said Mrs. Restarick vaguely.",
    "Even when they get married theyre\nalways being persuaded back into industry or back into teaching.",
    "Have they persuaded you Madame\nto come back into anything No.",
    "I was brought up in South Africa.",
    "I only came here with my husband a short time ago Its all  rather strange to me still.",
    "She looked\nround her with what Poirot judged to be an absence of enthusiasm.",
    "It was a handsomely furnished room of a conventional type  without personality.",
    "Two large portraits hung on the walls  the only personal touch.",
    "The first was that of a thin lipped\nwoman in a grey velvet evening dress.",
    "Facing her on the opposite wall was a man of about thirtyodd with\nan air of repressed energy about him.",
    "Your daughter I suppose finds it dull in the country Yes it is much better for her to be in London.",
    "She doesnt like it here.",
    "She paused abruptly and then as though the last words were almost dragged\nout of her she said   and she doesnt like me.",
    "Impossible said Hercule Poirot with Gallic\npoliteness.",
    "Not at all impossible Oh well I suppose it often happens.",
    "I suppose its hard for girls to accept a\nstepmother.",
    "Was your daughter very fond of her own mother I suppose she must have been.",
    "Shes a\ndifficult girl.",
    "I suppose most girls are.",
    "Poirot sighed and said Mothers and fathers have much less\ncontrol over daughters nowadays.",
    "It is not as it used to be in the old goodfashioned days.",
    "No indeed.",
    "One dare not say so Madame but I must confess I regret that they show so very little discrimination in\nchoosing their \u2014 how do you say it \u2014 their boy friends Norma has been a great worry to her father\nin that way.",
    "However I suppose it is no good complaining.",
    "People must make their own experiments.",
    "But I must take you up to Uncle Roddy \u2014 he has his own rooms upstairs.",
    "She led the way out of the\nroom.",
    "Poirot looked back over his shoulder.",
    "A dull room a room without character \u2014 except perhaps\nfor the two portraits.",
    "By the style of the womans dress Poirot judged that they dated from some years\nback.",
    "If that was the first Mrs. Restarick Poirot did not think that he would have liked her.",
    "He said Those are fine portraits Madame.",
    "Yes.",
    "Lansberger did them.",
    "It was the name of a famous\nand exceedingly expensive fashionable portrait painter of twenty years ago.",
    "His meticulous naturalism had\nnow gone out of fashion and since his death he was little spoken of.",
    "His sitters were sometimes\nsneeringly spoken of as clothes props but Poirot thought they were a good deal more than that.",
    "He\nsuspected that there was a carefully concealed mockery behind the smooth exteriors that Lansberger\nexecuted so effortlessly.",
    "Mary Restarick said as she went up the stairs ahead of him They have just come out of storage  and\nbeen cleaned up and   She stopped abruptly  coming to a dead halt one hand on the stairrail.",
    "Above her a figure had just turned the corner of the staircase on its way down.",
    "It was a figure that seemed strangely incongruous.",
    "It might have been someone in fancy dress someone\nwho certainly did not match with this house.",
    "He was a figure familiar enough to Poirot in different conditions a figure often met in the streets of\nLondon or even at parties.",
    "A representative of the youth of today.",
    "He wore a black coat an elaborate\nvelvet waistcoat skin tight pants and rich curls of chestnut hair hung down on his neck.",
    "He looked exotic\nand rather beautiful and it needed a few moments to be certain of his sex.",
    "David Mary Restarick spoke sharply.",
    "What on earth are you doing here The young man was by no means taken aback.",
    "Startled you he\nasked.",
    "So sorry.",
    "What are you doing here \u2014 in this house You \u2014 have you come down here with\nNorma Norma No.",
    "I hoped to find her here.",
    "Find her here \u2014 what do you mean\nShes in London.",
    "Oh but my dear she isnt.",
    "At any rate shes not at 67 Borodene Mansions.",
    "What\ndo you mean she isnt there Well since she didnt come back this weekend I thought she was\nprobably here with you.",
    "I came down to see what she was up to.",
    "She left here Sunday night as usual.",
    "She added in an angry voice Why didnt you ring the bell and let us know you were here What are you\ndoing roaming about the house Really darling you seem to be thinking Im going to pinch the spoons\nor something.",
    "Surely its natural to walk into a house in broad daylight.",
    "Why ever not Well were oldfashioned and\nwe dont like it.",
    "Oh dear dear.",
    "David sighed.",
    "The fuss everyone makes.",
    "Well my dear if Im not\ngoing to have a welcome and you dont seem to know where your stepdaughter is I suppose Id better\nbe moving along.",
    "Shall I turn out my pockets before I go Dont be absurd David.",
    "Tata then.",
    "The\nyoung man passed them waved an airy hand and went on down and out through the open front door.",
    "Horrible creature said Mary Restarick with a sharpness of rancour that startled Poirot.",
    "I cant bear\nhim.",
    "I simply cant stand him.",
    "Why is England absolutely full of these people nowadays Ah Madame\ndo not disquiet yourself.",
    "It is all a question of fashion.",
    "There have always been fashions.",
    "You see less in the country but in\nLondon you meet plenty of them.",
    "Dreadful said Mary.",
    "Absolutely dreadful.",
    "Effeminate exotic.",
    "And\nyet not unlike a Vandyke portrait do you not think so Madame In a gold frame wearing a lace collar\nyou would not then say he was effeminate or exotic.",
    "Daring to come down here like that.",
    "Andrew would have been furious.",
    "It worries him dreadfully.",
    "Daughters can be very worrying.",
    "Its not\neven as though Andrew knew Norma well.",
    "Hes been abroad since she was a child.",
    "He left her entirely\nto her mother to bring up and now he finds her a complete puzzle.",
    "So do I for that matter.",
    "I cant help feeling that she is a very odd type of girl.",
    "One has no kind of authority over them these days.",
    "They seem to like the worst type of young men.",
    "Shes\nabsolutely infatuated with this David Baker.",
    "One cant do anything.",
    "Andrew forbade him the house and\nlook he turns up here walks in as cool as a cucumber.",
    "I think \u2014 I almost think Id better not tell\nAndrew.",
    "I dont want him to be unduly worried.",
    "I believe she goes about with this creature in London and not\nonly with him.",
    "There are some much worse ones even.",
    "The kind that dont wash completely unshaven\nfaces and funny sprouting beards and greasy clothes.",
    "Poirot said cheerfully.",
    "Alas Madame you must\nnot distress yourself.",
    "The indiscretions of youth pass.",
    "I hope so Im sure.",
    "Norma is a very difficult girl.",
    "Sometimes I think shes not right in the head.",
    "Shes so peculiar.",
    "She really looks sometimes as though she\nisnt all there.",
    "These extraordinary dislikes she takes \u2014  Dislikes She hates me.",
    "Really hates me.",
    "I\ndont see why its necessary.",
    "I suppose she was very devoted to her mother but after all its only\nreasonable that her father should marry again isnt it Do you think she really hates you Oh I know\nshe does.",
    "Ive had ample proof of it.",
    "I cant say how relieved I was when she went off to London.",
    "I didnt\nwant to make trouble   She stopped suddenly.",
    "It was as though for the first time she realised that she\nwas talking to a stranger.",
    "Poirot had the capacity to attract confidences.",
    "It was as though when people were talking to him they hardly realised who it was they were talking to.",
    "She gave a short laugh now.",
    "Dear me she said I dont really know why Im saying all this to you.",
    "I expect every family has these\nproblems.",
    "Poor stepmothers we have a hard time of it.",
    "Ah here we are.",
    "She tapped on a door.",
    "Come in come in.",
    "It was a stentorian roar.",
    "Here is a visitor to see you.",
    "Uncle said Mary Restarick as she walked into the room Poirot behind\nher.",
    "A broadshouldered squarefaced redcheeked irascible looking elderly man had been pacing the floor.",
    "He stumped forward towards them.",
    "At the table behind him a girl was sitting sorting letters and papers.",
    "Her head was bent over them a sleek dark head.",
    "This is Monsieur Hercule Poirot Uncle Roddy said Mary Restarick.",
    "Poirot stepped forward gracefully into action and speech.",
    "Ah Sir Roderick it is many years \u2014 many\nyears since I have had the pleasure of meeting you.",
    "We have to go back so far as the last war.",
    "It was I\nthink in Normandy the last time.",
    "How well I remember there was there also Colonel Race and there\nwas General Abercromby and there was Air Marshal Sir Edmund Collingsby.",
    "What decisions we had to\ntake And what difficulties we had with security.",
    "Ah nowadays there is no longer the need for secrecy.",
    "I\nrecall the unmasking of that secret agent who succeeded for so long \u2014 you remember Captain\nHenderson.",

    "He patted her on the shoulder.",
    "Dont know what I should do without her he said.",
    "I dont really.",
    "Oh no the girl protested.",
    "I am not\nmuch good really.",
    "I cannot type very fast.",

    "Youre my memory too.",
    "My eyes and my ears and a great many other things.",
    "She smiled again at him.",
    "One remembers murmured Poirot some of the excellent stories that used to go the round.",
    "I dont\nknow if they were exaggerated or not.",
    "Now for instance the day that someone stole your car and \u2014 \nhe proceeded to follow up the tale.",
    "Sir Roderick was delighted.",
    "Ha ha of course now.",
    "Yes indeed well bit of exaggeration I expect.",
    "But\non the whole thats how it was.",
    "Yes yes well fancy your remembering that after all this long time.",
    "But I\ncould tell you a better one than that now.",
    "He launched forth into another tale.",
    "Poirot listened applauded.",
    "Finally he glanced at his watch and rose to his feet.",
    "But I must detain you no longer he said.",
    "You are engaged I can see in important work.",
    "It was just\nthat being in this neighbourhood I could not help paying my respects.",
    "Years pass but you I see have\nlost none of your vigour of your enjoyment of life.",
    "Well well perhaps you may say so.",
    "Anyway you mustnt pay me too many compliments \u2014 but surely youll stay and have tea.",

    "The young man laughed.",
    "How Mrs. Restarick dislikes the mere sight of me.",
    "Actually I reciprocate her dislike.",
    "I dont care much for Restarick either.",
    "There is something singularly unattractive about successful tycoons dont you think It depends on the\npoint of view.",

    "What do you mean by talking about weed killer Are you suggesting that Norma  that\nshed dream of  that   People talk said Poirot.",
    "Talk goes round the neighbourhood.",
    "Do you\nmean that somebody has said that Norma has tried to poison her stepmother\n\n\fThats ridiculous.",
    "Its absolutely absurd.",
    "It is very unlikely I agree said Poirot.",
    "Actually people have\nnot been saying that.",
    "Oh.",
    "Sorry.",
    "I misunderstood.",
    "But what did you mean My dear young man\nsaid Poirot you must realise that there are rumours going about and rumours are almost always about\nthe same person  a husband.",

    "But do you not realise that there are\ncertain things that it might be useful to know What sort of things Faces said Poirot.",
    "A well known\nface perhaps which Sir Roderick might recognise.",
    "A face or a mannerism a way of talking a way of\nwalking a gesture.",
    "People do remember you know.",
    "Old people.",
    "They remember not things that have happened last week\nor last month or last year but they remember something that happened say nearly twenty years ago.",

    "I wonder now he said Did you go to see the old boy or did you go to see the little girl eh Did\nyou want to know what she was doing in the house Ive wondered once or twice myself.",
    "Do you think\nshe took that post there to get a bit of past information out of the old boy I do not think said Poirot\nthat it will serve any useful purpose to discuss these matters.",
    "She seems a very devoted and\nattentivewhat shall I call her secretary A mixture of a hospital nurse a secretary a companion an\nau pair girl an uncles help Yes one could find a good many names for her couldnt one\nHes besotted about her.",
    "You noticed that It is not unnatural under the circumstances said Poirot\nprimly.",
    "I can tell you someone who doesnt like her and thats our Mary.",
    "And she perhaps does not like Mary\nRestarick either.",
    "So thats what you think is it said David.",
    "That Sonia doesnt like Mary Restarick.",
    "Perhaps you go as far as thinking that she may have made a few enquiries as to where the weed killer\nwas kept\nBah he added the whole things ridiculous.",
    "All right.",
    "Thanks for the lift.",
    "I think Ill get out here.",
    "Aha.",

    "II Mrs. Oliver prowled round her sittingroom.",
    "She was very restless.",
    "An hour ago she had parcelled up a typescript that she had just finished\ncorrecting.",
    "She was about to send it off to her publisher who was anxiously awaiting it and constantly\nprodding her about it every three or four days.",
    "There you are said Mrs. Oliver addressing the empty air and conjuring up an imaginary publisher.",
    "There you are and I hope you like it  dont.",
    "I think its lousy I dont believe you know whether\nanything I write is good or bad.",
    "Anyway I warned you.",
    "I told you it was frightful.",
    "You said Oh no no I dont believe that for a moment.",
    "You just wait and see said Mrs.\nOliver vengefully.",
    "You just wait and see.",
    "She opened the door called to Edith her maid gave her the\nparcel and directed that it should be taken to the post at once.",
    "And now said Mrs. Oliver what am I going to do with myself She began strolling about again.",
    "Yes thought Mrs. Oliver I wish I had those tropical birds and things back on the wall instead of these\nidiotic cherries.",
    "I used to feel like something in a tropical wood.",
    "A lion or a tiger or a leopard or a\ncheetah\nWhat could I possibly feel like in a cherry orchard except a bird scarer She looked round again.",
    "Cheeping like a bird thats what I ought to be doing she said gloomily.",
    "Eating cherries...",
    "I wish it was\nthe right time of year for cherries.",
    "Id like some cherries.",
    "I wonder now \u2014  She went to the telephone.",
    "I\nwill ascertain.",
    "Madam said the voice of George in answer to her enquiry.",

    "Hercule Poirot at your service Madame he said.",
    "Whereve you been said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Youve been away all day.",
    "I suppose you went down to look up the Restaricks.",
    "Is that it Did you see\nSir Roderick What did you find out Nothing said Hercule Poirot.",
    "How dreadfully dull said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "No I do not think it is really so dull.",
    "It is rather astonishing that I have not found out anything.",
    "Why is it so astonishing I dont understand.",
    "Because said Poirot it means either there was nothing to find out and that let me tell you does not\naccord with the facts or else something was being very cleverly concealed.",
    "That you see would be\ninteresting.",
    "Mrs. Restarick by the way did not know the girl was missing.",
    "You mean \u2014 she has\nnothing to do with the girl having disappeared So it seems.",
    "I met there the young man.",
    "You mean the\nunsatisfactory young man that nobody likes That is right.",
    "The unsatisfactory young man.",
    "Did you\nthink he was unsatisfactory From whose point of view Not from the girls point of view I suppose.",
    "The girl who came to see me I am sure would have been highly delighted with him.",
    "Did he look very\nawful He looked very beautiful said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Beautiful said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I dont know that I like beautiful young men.",
    "Girls do said Poirot.",
    "Yes youre quite right.",
    "They like beautiful young men.",
    "I dont mean goodlooking young men or\nsmartlooking young men or well dressed or well washed looking young men.",
    "I mean they either like\nyoung men looking as though they were just going on in a Restoration comedy or else very dirty young\nmen looking as though they were just going to take some awful tramps job.",
    "It seemed that he also did\n\n\fnot know where the girl is now   Or else he wasnt admitting it.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "He had gone down there.",
    "Why He was actually in the house.",
    "He had taken the trouble to walk in without anyone seeing him.",
    "Again why For what reason Was he looking for the girl Or was he looking for something else You\nthink he was looking for something  He was looking for something in the girls room said Poirot.",
    "How do you know Did you see him there No I only saw him coming down the stairs but I found a\nvery nice little piece of damp mud in Normas room that could have come from his shoe.",
    "It is possible\nthat she herself may have asked him to bring her something from that room  there are a lot of\npossibilities.",
    "There is another girl in that house  and a pretty one  He may have come down there to\nmeet her.",
    "Yes \u2014 many possibilities.",
    "What are you going to do next demanded Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Nothing said Poirot.",
    "Thats very dull said Mrs. Oliver disapprovingly.",
    "I am going to receive perhaps a little information from those I have employed to find it though it is quite\npossible that I shall receive nothing at all.",

    "Oh I know you think so.",
    "Youre such a conventional type Claudia.",
    "Not\nat all.",

    "It matters for me said Claudia because my boss happens to be her father.",
    "Sooner or later if anything peculiar has happened to her theyll ask me why I didnt mention the fact that\nshe hadnt come home.",
    "Yes I suppose they might pitch on you.",
    "But theres no real reason is there why Norma should have to report to us every time shes going to be\naway from here for a day or two.",
    "Or even a few nights.",
    "I mean shes not a paying guest or anything.",
    "Youre not in charge of the girl.",
    "No but Mr. Restarick did mention he felt glad to know that she had got\na room here with us.",
    "So that entitles you to go and tittletattle about her every time shes absent without\nleave Shes probably got a crush on some new man.",
    "Shes got a crush on David said Claudia.",
    "Are\nyou sure she isnt holed up at his place Oh I shouldnt think so.",

    "If not why did he come round looking\nfor her here the other day You soon marched him out again said Frances.",
    "I think she added\ngetting up and looking at her face in a rather unflattering small kitchen mirror I think it might have been\nme he really came to see.",
    "Youre too idiotic He came here looking for Norma.",
    "That girls mental\nsaid Frances.",
    "Sometimes I really think she is Well I know she is.",
    "Look here Claudia Im going to tell you that\nsomething now.",
    "You ought to know.",

    "I know you dont like anyone fiddling with your things   I certainly dont said Claudia.",

    "Anyway I went into her room and I rooted in her drawer\nand I  well I found something.",
    "A knife.",
    "A knife said Claudia surprised.",
    "What sort of a knife You know we had that sort of shindy thing in the courtyard A group of beats\nteenagers whod come in here and were having a fight with flickknives and all that.",
    "And Norma came in just after.",
    "Yes Yes I remember.",
    "One of the boys got stabbed so a reporter\ntold me and he ran away.",
    "Well the knife in Normals drawer was a flickknife.",
    "It had got a stain on it  looked like dried blood.",
    "Frances Youre being absurdly dramatic.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "But Im sure thats what it was.",
    "And what on earth was that doing hidden away in Normas drawer I\nshould like to know I suppose  she might have picked it up.",
    "What  a souvenir And hidden it\naway and never told us What did you do with it I put it back said Frances slowly.",
    "I \u2014 I didnt know what else to do.",
    "I couldnt decide whether to tell you or not.",
    "Then yesterday I looked again and it was gone Claudia.",
    "Not\na trace of it.",

    "Having packed off her completed manuscript\nwith a highly virtuous feeling work was over.",
    "She had now only as many times before to relax to enjoy\nherself to lie fallow until the creative urge became active once more.",
    "She walked about her flat in a rather\naimless fashion touching things picking them up putting them down looking in the drawers of her desk\nrealising that there were plenty of letters there to be dealt with but feeling also that in her present state of\nvirtuous accomplishment she was certainly not going to deal with anything so tiresome as that now.",
    "She\nwanted something interesting to do.",
    "She wantedwhat did she want\nShe thought about the conversation she had had with Hercule Poirot the warning he had given her.",
    "Ridiculous After all why shouldnt she participate in this problem which she was sharing with Poirot\nPoirot might choose to sit in a chair put the tips of his fingers together and set his grey cells whirring to\nwork while his body reclined comfortably within four walls.",

    "What excuse could she offer for\nbarging into Sir Roderick Horsefields house\nShe considered another visit to Borodene Mansions.",
    "Something still to be found out there perhaps She\nwould have to think of another excuse for going there.",
    "She wasnt quite sure what excuse she would use\nbut anyway that seemed the only possible place where more information could be obtained.",
    "What was\nthe time\n\n\fTen a.m.",
    "There were certain possibilities.",
    "On the way there she concocted an excuse.",
    "Not a very original excuse.",
    "In fact Mrs. Oliver would have\nliked to have found something more intriguing but perhaps she reflected prudently it was just as well to\nkeep to something completely everyday and plausible.",

    "Perhaps shes still down with her people in the country.",
    "I know she was going there last weekend.",
    "Yes I expect thats it said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "This was a book I brought her.",
    "One of my books.",
    "One of Mrs. Olivers books did not seem to strike any chord of interest in the\ncleaning woman.",
    "I was sitting here went on Mrs.\nOliver patting an armchair at least I think so.",
    "And then I moved to the window and perhaps to the\nsofa.",
    "She dug down vehemently behind the cushions of the chair.",
    "The cleaning woman obliged by doing\nthe same thing to the sofa cushions.",
    "Youve no idea how maddening it is when one loses something like that went on Mrs. Oliver chattily.",
    "One has all ones engagements written down there.",
    "Im quite sure Im lunching with someone very\nimportant today and I cant remember who it was or where the luncheon was to be.",
    "Only of course it may be tomorrow.",
    "If so Im lunching with someone else quite different.",
    "Oh dear.",
    "Very trying for you maam Im sure said the cleaning woman with sympathy.",
    "Theyre such nice flats these said Mrs. Oliver looking round.",
    "A long way up.",
    "Well that gives you a very good view doesnt it Yes but if they face east you get a\nlot of cold wind in winter.",
    "Comes right through these metal window frames.",
    "Some people have had\ndouble windows put in.",
    "Oh yes I wouldnt care for a flat facing this way in winter.",
    "No give me a nice ground floor flat every\ntime.",
    "Much more convenient too if youve got children.",
    "For prams and all that you know.",
    "Oh yes Im all\nfor the ground floor I am.",
    "Think if there was to be a fire.",
    "Yes of course that would be terrible said\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "I suppose there are fire escapes You cant always get to a fire door.",
    "Terrified of fire I am.",
    "Always have been.",
    "And theyre ever so expensive these flats.",
    "You wouldnt believe the rents they ask\nThats why Miss Holland gets two other girls to go in with her.",
    "Oh yes I think I met them both.",
    "Miss\nGarys an artist isnt she Works for an art gallery she does.",

    "Shes secretary to a very rich gentleman just come back from South America\nor somewhere like that.",
    "Hes Miss Normas father and it was he who asked Miss Holland to take her as\na boarder when the last young lady went off to get married \u2014 and she mentioned as she was looking for\nanother girl.",
    "Well she couldnt very well refuse could she Not since he was her employer.",
    "Did she\nwant to refuse The woman sniffed.",
    "I think she would have\u2014if shed known.",
    "Known what The question was too direct.",
    "Its not for me to say anything Im sure.",
    "Its not my business \u2014  Mrs. Oliver continued to look mildly\nenquiring.",
    "Mrs. Mop fell.",
    "Its not that she isnt a nice young lady.",
    "Scatty \u2014 but then theyre nearly all scatty.",
    "But I think as a doctor ought to see her.",
    "There are times when she doesnt seem to know rightly what shes doing or where she is.",
    "It gives you\nquite a turn sometimes \u2014 Looks just how my husbands nephew does after hes had a fit.",
    "Terrible fits\nhe has \u2014 you wouldnt believe Only Ive never known her have fits.",
    "Maybe she takes things \u2014a lot\ndo.",
    "I believe there is a young man her family doesnt approve of.",
    "Yes so Ive heard.",
    "Hes come here\nto call for her once or twice \u2014 though Ive never seen him.",
    "One of these Mods by all accounts.",
    "Miss\nHolland doesnt like it\u2014 but what can you do nowadays Girls go their own way.",
    "Sometimes one feels\nvery upset about girls nowadays said Mrs. Oliver and tried to look serious and responsible.",
    "Not brought up right thats whatsays.",
    "Im afraid not.",
    "No Im afraid not.",
    "One feels really a girl like\nNorma Restarick would be better at home than coming all alone to London and earning her living as an\ninterior decorator.",
    "She dont like it at home.",
    "Really Got a stepmother.",
    "Girls dont like stepmothers.",
    "From what Ive heard the stepmothers done her best tried to pull her up tried to keep flashy young men\nout of the house that sort of thing.",
    "She knows girls pick up with the wrong young man and a lot of harm\nmay come of it.",

    "Have you got sons Two boys weve got.",
    "Ones doing very well at school and the\nother one hes in a printers doing well there too.",
    "Yes very nice boys they are.",
    "Mind you boys can\ncause you trouble too.",
    "But girls is more worrying I think.",
    "You feel you ought to be able to do something\nabout them.",
    "Yes said Mrs. Oliver thoughtfully one does feel that.",
    "She saw signs of the cleaning\nwoman wishing to return to her cleaning.",
    "Its too bad about my diary she said.",
    "Well thank you very much and I hope I havent wasted your time.",
    "Well I hope youll find it Im sure\nsaid the other woman obligingly.",
    "Mrs. Oliver went out of the flat and considered what she should do next.",
    "She couldnt think of anything\nshe could do further that day but a plan for tomorrow began to form in her mind.",
    "When she got home Mrs. Oliver in an important way got out a notebook and jotted down in it various\nthings under the heading Facts I have learned.",
    "On the whole the facts did not amount to very much but\nMrs. Oliver true to her calling managed to make the most of them that could be made.",
    "Possibly the fact\nthat Claudia ReeceHolland was employed by Normas father was the most salient fact of any.",
    "She had\nnot known that before she rather doubted ifHercule Poirot had known it either.",
    "She thought of ringing\n\n\fhim up on the telephone and acquainting him with it but decided to keep it to herself for the moment\nbecause of her plan for the morrow.",
    "In fact Mrs. Oliver felt at this moment less like a detective novelist than like an ardent bloodhound.",
    "She\nwas on the trail nose down on the scent and tomorrow morning  well tomorrow morning she would\nsee.",
    "True to her plan Mrs. Oliver rose early partook of two cups of tea and a boiled egg and started out on\nher quest.",
    "Once more she arrived in the vicinity of Borodene Mansions.",
    "She wondered whether she\nmight be getting a bit well known there so this time she did not enter the courtyard but skulked around\neither one entrance to it or the other scanning the various people who were turning out into the morning\ndrizzle to trot off on their way to work.",
    "They were mostly girls and looked deceptively alike.",
    "How extraordinary human beings were when you\nconsidered them like this emerging purposefully from these large tall buildings  just like anthills thought\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "One had never considered an anthill properly she decided.",
    "It always looked so aimless as one disturbed it with the toe of a shoe.",
    "All those little things rushing about\nwith bits of grass in their mouths streaming along industriously worried anxious looking as though they\nwere running to and fro and going nowhere but presumably they were just as well organised as these\nhuman beings here.",
    "That man for instance who had just passed her.",
    "Scurrying along muttering to\nhimself.",
    "I wonder whats upsetting you thought Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She walked up and down a little more\nthen she drew back suddenly.",
    "Claudia ReeceHolland came out of the entrance way walking at a brisk businesslike pace.",
    "As before\nshe looked very well turned out.",
    "Mrs. Oliver turned away so that she should not be recognised.",
    "Once\nshe had allowed Claudia to get a sufficient distance ahead of her she wheeled round again and followed\nin her tracks.",
    "Claudia ReeceHolland came to the end of the street and turned right into a main\nthoroughfare.",
    "She came to a bus stop and joined the queue.",
    "Mrs. Oliver still following her felt a momentary\nuneasiness.",
    "Supposing Claudia should turn round look at her recognise her All Mrs. Oliver could think\nof was to do several protracted but noiseless blows of the nose.",
    "But Claudia ReeceHolland seemed\ntotally absorbed in her own thoughts.",
    "She looked at none of her fellow waiters for buses.",
    "Mrs. Oliver\nwas about third in the queue behind her.",
    "Finally the right bus came and there was a surge forward.",
    "Claudia got on the bus and went straight up to the top.",
    "Mrs. Oliver got inside and was able to get a seat\nclose to the door as the uncomfortable third person.",
    "When the conductor came round for fares Mrs. Oliver pressed a reckless one and sixpence into his\nhand.",
    "After all she had no idea by what route the bus went or indeed how far the distance was to what\nthe cleaning woman had described vaguely as one of those new buildings by St.\nPauls.",
    "She was on the alert and ready when the venerable dome was at last sighted.",
    "Any time now she\nthought to herself and fixed a steady eye on those who descended from the platform above.",
    "Ah yes\nthere came Claudia neat and chic in her smart suit.",
    "She got off the bus.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver followed her in due course and kept at a nicely calculated distance.",
    "Very interesting thought Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Here I am actually trailing someone Just like in my books.",
    "And\nwhats more I must be doing it very well because she hasnt the least idea.",
    "Claudia ReeceHolland\nindeed looked very much absorbed in her own thoughts.",
    "Thats a very capable looking girl thought Mrs. Oliver as indeed she had thought before.",
    "If I was\nthinking of having a go at guessing a murderer a good capable murderer Id choose someone very like\nher.",
    "Unfortunately nobody had been murdered yet that is to say unless the girl Norma had been\nentirely right in her assumption that she herself had committed a murder.",
    "This part of London seemed to have suffered or profited from a large amount of building in the recent\nyears.",
    "Enormous skyscrapers most of which Mrs. Oliver thought very hideous mounted to the sky with\na square matchboxlike air.",
    "Claudia turned into a building.",
    "Now I shall find out exactly thought Mrs.\nOliver and turned into it after her.",
    "Four lifts appeared to be all going up and down with frantic haste.",
    "This\nMrs. Oliver thought was going to be more difficult.",
    "However they were of a very large size and by\ngetting into Claudias one at the last minute Mrs. Oliver was able to interpose large masses of tall men\nbetween herself and the figure she was following.",
    "Claudias destination turned out to be the fourth floor.",
    "She went along a corridor and Mrs. Oliver\nlingering behind two of her tall men noted the door where she went in.",
    "Three doors from the end of the\ncorridor.",
    "Mrs. Oliver arrived at the same door in due course and was able to read the legend on it.",
    "Joshua\nRestarick Ltd was the legend it bore.",
    "Having got as far as that Mrs. Oliver felt as though she did not quite know what to do next.",
    "She had\nfound Normas fathers place of business and the place where Claudia worked but now slightly\ndisabused she felt that this was not so much of a discovery as it might have been.",
    "Frankly did it help Probably it didnt.",
    "She waited around a few moments walking from one end to the other of the corridor looking to see if\nanybody else interesting went in at the door of Restarick Enterprises.",
    "Two or three girls did but they did\nnot look particularly interesting.",
    "Mrs. Oliver went down again in the lift and walked rather disconsolately out of the building.",
    "She couldnt\nquite think what to do next.",
    "She took a walk round the adjacent streets she meditated a visit to St.\nPauls.",
    "I might go up in the Whispering Gallery and whisper thought Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I wonder now how the Whispering Gallery would do for the scene of a murder No she decided\ntoo profane Im afraid.",
    "No I dont think that would be quite nice.",
    "She walked thoughtfully towards the\nMermaid Theatre.",
    "That she thought had far more possibilities.",
    "She walked back in the direction of the various new buildings.",
    "Then feeling the lack of a more substantial\nbreakfast than she had had she turned into a local cafe.",
    "It was moderately well filled with people having extra late breakfast or else early elevenses.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver looking round vaguely for a suitable table gave a gasp.",
    "At a table near the wall the girl Norma was sitting and opposite her was sitting a young man with lavish\n\n\fchestnut hair curled on his shoulders wearing a red velvet waistcoat and a very fancy jacket.",
    "David said Mrs. Oliver under her breath.",
    "It must be David.",
    "He and the girl Norma were talking\nexcitedly together.",
    "Mrs. Oliver considered a plan of campaign made up her mind and nodding her head in satisfaction\ncrossed the floor of the cafe to a discreet door marked Ladies.",
    "Mrs. Oliver was not quite sure whether Norma was likely to recognise her or not.",
    "It was not always the\nvaguest looking people who proved the vaguest in fact.",
    "At the moment Norma did not look as though\nshe was likely to look at anybody but David but who knows\nI expect I can do something to myself anyway thought Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She looked at herself in a small\nflyblown mirror provided by the cafes management studying particularly what she considered to be the\nfocal point of a womans appearance her hair.",
    "No one knew this better than Mrs.\nOliver owing to the innumerable times that she had changed her mode of hairdressing and had failed to\nbe recognised by her friends in consequence.",
    "Giving her head an appraising eye she started work.",
    "Out came the pins she took off several coils of hair wrapped them up in her handkerchief and stuffed\nthem into her handbag parted her hair in the middle combed it sternly back from her face and rolled it\nup into a modest bun at the back of her neck.",
    "She also took out a pair of spectacles and put them on her\nnose.",
    "There was a really earnest look about her now\nAlmost intellectual Mrs. Oliver thought approvingly.",
    "She altered the shape of her mouth by an\napplication of lipstick and emerged once more into the cafe moving carefully since the spectacles were\nonly for reading and in consequence that landscape was blurred.",
    "She crossed the cafe and made her\nway to an empty table next to that occupied by Norma and David.",
    "She sat down so that she was facing\nDavid.",
    "Norma on the near side sat with her back to her.",
    "Norma therefore would not see her unless she turned\nher head right round.",
    "The waitress drifted up.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver ordered coffee and a Bath bun and settled down to be inconspicuous.",
    "Norma and David did not even notice her.",
    "They were deeply in the middle of a passionate discussion.",
    "It\ntook Mrs. Oliver just a minute or two to tune in to them.",
    "...",
    "But you only fancy these things David was saying.",
    "You imagine them.",
    "Theyre all utter utter nonsense my dear girl.",
    "I dont know.",
    "I cant tell.",
    "Normas voice had a queer\nlack of resonance in it.",
    "Mrs. Oliver could not hear her as well as she heard David since Normas back was turned to her but\nthe dullness of the girls tone struck her disagreeably.",
    "There was something wrong here she thought.",
    "Very wrong.",
    "She remembered the story as Poirot had first told it to her.",
    "She thinks she may have\ncommitted a murder.",
    "What was the matter with the girl.",
    "Hallucinations Was her mind really slightly\naffected or was it no more and no less than truth and in consequence the girl had suffered a bad shock\nIf you ask me its all fuss on Marys part Shes a thoroughly stupid woman anyway and she imagines\n\n\fshe has illnesses and all that sort of thing.",
    "She kw ill. All right then she was ill. Any sensible woman\nwould get the doctor to give her some antibiotic or other and not get het up.",
    "She thought  did it to her.",
    "My father thinks so too.",
    "I tell you Norma you imagine all these things.",
    "You just say that to me\nDavid.",
    "You say it to me to cheer me up.",
    "Supposing I did give her the stuff What do you mean\nsuppose You must know whether you did or you didnt.",
    "You cant be so idiotic Norma.",
    "I dont know.",
    "You keep saying that.",
    "You keep coming back to that\nand saying it again and again.",
    "I dont know.",
    "I dont know.",
    "You dont understand.",
    "You dont\nunderstand in the least what hate is.",
    "I hated her from the first moment I saw her.",
    "I know.",
    "You told me\nthat.",
    "Thats the queer part of it.",
    "I told you that and yet I dont even remember telling you that.",
    "Dyou\nsee Every now and then I  I tell people things.",
    "I tell people things that I want to do or that I have\ndone or that Im going to do.",
    "But I dont even remember telling them the things.",
    "Its as though I was thinking all these things in my mind and sometimes they come out in the open and I\nsay them to people.",
    "I did say them to you didnt I Well  I mean  look here dont lets harp back\nto that.",
    "But I did say it to you Didnt I All right all right One says things like that.",
    "I hate her and Id\nlike to kill her.",
    "I think Ill poison her But thats only kid stuff if you know what I mean as though you werent quite\ngrown up.",
    "Its a very natural thing.",
    "Children say it a lot.",
    "I hate so and so.",
    "Ill cut off his head Kids say it\nat school.",
    "About some master they particularly dislike.",
    "You think it was just that But that sounds as\nthough I wasnt grown up.",
    "Well youre not in some ways.",
    "If youd just pull yourself together realise\nhow silly it all is.",
    "What can it matter if you do hate her Youve got away from home and dont have to\nlive with her.",
    "Why shouldnt I live in my own home \u2014with my own father said Norma.",
    "Its not fair.",
    "Its not fair.",
    "First he went away and left my mother and now just when hes coming back to\nme he goes and marries Mary.",
    "Of course I hate her and she hates me too.",
    "I used to think about killing\nher used to think of ways of doing it.",
    "I used to enjoy thinking like that.",
    "But then \u2014 when she really got\nill... David said uneasily You dont think youre a witch or anything do you You dont make figures in\nwax and stick pins into them or do that sort of thing Oh no.",
    "That would be silly.",
    "What I did was real.",
    "Quite real.",
    "Look here Norma what do you mean when you say it was real The bottle was there in\nmy drawer.",
    "Yes I opened the drawer and found it.",
    "What bottle The Dragon Exterminator.",
    "Selective weed killer.",
    "Thats what it was labelled.",
    "Stuff in a dark green bottle and you were supposed to spray it on things.",
    "And it had labels with Caution\nand Poison too.",
    "Did you buy it Or did you just find it I dont know where I got it but it was there\nin my drawer and it was half empty.",
    "And then you  you  remembered   Yes said Norma.",
    "Yes...",
    "Her voice was vague almost dreamy.",
    "Yes...",
    "I think it was then it all came back to me.",
    "You\nthink so too dont you David I dont know what to make of you Norma.",
    "I really dont.",
    "I think in a\nway youre making it all up youre telling it to yourself.",
    "But she went to hospital for observation they\nsaid they were puzzled.",
    "Then they said they couldnt find anything wrong so she came home  and then\nshe got ill again and I began to be frightened.",
    "My father began looking at me in a queer sort of way and then the doctor came and they talked\ntogether shut up in fathers study.",
    "I went round outside and crept up to the window and I tried to listen.",
    "I wanted to hear what they were saying.",
    "They were planning together\u2014to send me away to a place where Id be shut up\n\n\fA place where Id have a course of treatment \u2014 or something.",
    "They thought you see that I was crazy\nand I was frightened... Because\u2014because I wasnt sure what Id done or what I hadnt done.",
    "Is that\nwhen you ran away No \u2014 that was later \u2014  Tell me.",
    "I dont want to talk about it any more.",
    "Youll have to let them know sooner or later where you are \u2014  I wont I hate them.",
    "I hate my father\nas much as I hate Mary.",
    "I wish they were dead.",
    "I wish they were both dead.",
    "Then \u2014 then I think Id be\nhappy again.",
    "Dont get all het up Look here Norma \u2014  He paused in an embarrassed manner \u2014\nIm not very set on marriage and all that rubbish...",
    "I mean I didnt think Id ever do anything of that kind\n\u2014 oh well not for years.",
    "One doesnt want to tie oneself up \u2014 but I think its the best thing we could do\nyou know.",

    "So either the couple in which they were interested had left the cafe and Mrs.\nOliver had gone on a shadowing expedition or else \u2014 To answer or else he went to the cafe door.",
    "One could not see the inside very well from the outside on account of steam so he pushed the door\ngently open and entered.",
    "His eyes swept round it.",
    "He saw at once the girl who had come to visit him at the breakfast table.",
    "She was sitting by herself at a\ntable against the wall.",
    "She was smoking a cigarette and staring in front of her.",
    "She seemed to be lost in thought.",
    "No Poirot\nthought hardly that.",
    "There did not seem to be any thought there.",
    "She was lost in a kind of oblivion.",
    "She was somewhere else.",
    "He crossed the room quietly and sat down in the chair opposite her.",
    "She looked up then and he was at\nleast gratified to see that he was recognised.",
    "So we meet again.",
    "Mademoiselle he said pleasantly.",
    "I see you recognise me.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I do.",
    "It is\nalways gratifying to be recognised by a young lady one has only met once and for a very short time.",
    "She\ncontinued to look at him without speaking.",
    "And how did you know me may I ask\nWhat made you recognise me Your moustache said Norma immediately.",
    "It couldnt be anyone else.",
    "He was gratified by that observation and stroked it with the pride and vanity\nthat he was apt to display on these occasions.",
    "Ah yes very true.",
    "Yes there are not many moustaches such as mine.",
    "It is a fine one hein Yes  well\nyes  I suppose it is.",
    "Ah you are perhaps not a connoisseur of moustaches but I can tell you.",
    "Miss\nRestarickMiss Norma Restarick is it not  that it is a very fine moustache.",
    "He had dwelt deliberately\nupon her name.",
    "She had at first looked so oblivious to everything around her so far away that he\nwondered if she would notice.",
    "She did.",
    "It startled her.",
    "How did you know my name she said.",
    "True you did not give your name to my servant when you came to see me that morning.",
    "How did you\nknow it How did you get to know it Who told you He saw the alarm the fear.",
    "A friend told me he said.",
    "Ones friends can be very useful.",
    "Who was it Mademoiselle you like\nkeeping your little secrets from me.",
    "I too have a preference for keeping my little secrets from you.",
    "I\ndont see how you could know who I was.",
    "I am Hercule Poirot said Poirot with his usual\nmagnificence.",
    "Then he left the initiative to her merely sitting there smiling gently at her.",
    "I \u2014 she began then stopped.",
    "\u2014 Would \u2014  Again she stopped.",
    "We did not get very far that morning I know said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Only so far as your telling me that\nyou had committed a murder.",
    "Oh Yes Mademoiselle that.",
    "But  I didnt mean it of course.",
    "I didnt mean anything like that.",
    "I mean it was just a joke.",
    "Vraiment You came to see me rather early\nin the morning at breakfast time.",
    "You said it was urgent.",
    "The urgency was because you might have committed a murder.",
    "That is your idea\nof a joke eh A waitress who had been hovering looking at Poirot with a fixed attention suddenly\ncame up to him and proffered him what appeared to be a paper boat such as it made for children to sail\nin a bath.",
    "This for you she said.",
    "Mr. Porritt\n\n\fA lady left it.",
    "Ah yes said Poirot.",
    "And how did you know who I was The lady said Id know by\nyour moustache.",
    "Said I wouldnt have seen a moustache like that before.",
    "And its true enough she\nadded gazing at it.",
    "Well thank you very much.",
    "Poirot took the boat from her untwisted it and smoothed it out he read\nsome hastily pencilled words Hes just going.",
    "Shes staying behind so Im going to leave her for you\nand follow him.",
    "It was signed Ariadne.",
    "Ah yes said Hercule Poirot folding it and slipping it into his pocket.",
    "What were we talking about\nYour sense of humour I think.",
    "Miss Restarick.",
    "Do you know just my name or \u2014 or do you know\neverything about me I know a few things about you.",
    "You are Miss Norma Restarick your address in\nLondon is 67 Borodene Mansions.",
    "Your home address is Crosshedges Long Basing.",
    "You live there with a father a stepmother a greatuncle and \u2014 ah yes an au pair girl.",
    "You see I am quite well informed.",
    "Youve been having me followed.",
    "No no said Poirot.",
    "Not at all.",
    "As to that I give you my word of honour.",
    "But you are not police are you You didnt say you were.",
    "I\nam not police no.",
    "Her suspicion and defiance broke down.",
    "I dont know what to do she said.",
    "I am not urging you to employ me said Poirot.",
    "For that you have said already that I am too old.",
    "Possibly you are right.",
    "But since I know who you are and something about you there is no reason we should not discuss\ntogether in a friendly fashion the troubles that afflict you.",
    "The old you must remember though considered\nincapable of action have nevertheless a good fund of experience on which to draw.",
    "Norma continued to\nlook at him doubtfully that wideeyed stare that had disquieted Poirot before.",
    "But she was in a sense\ntrapped and she had at this particular moment or so Poirot judged a wish to talk about things.",
    "For\nsome reason Poirot had always been a person it was easy to talk to.",
    "They think Im crazy she said bluntly.",
    "And  and I rather think Im crazy too.",
    "Mad.",
    "That is most interesting said Hercule Poirot cheerfully.",
    "There are many different names for these things.",
    "Very grand names.",
    "Names rolled out happily by\npsychiatrists psychologists and others.",
    "But when you say crazy that describes very well what the general\nappearance may be to ordinary everyday people.",
    "Eh bien then you are crazy or you appear crazy or\nyou think you are crazy and possibly you may be crazy.",
    "But all the same that is not to say the condition\nis serious.",
    "It is a thing that people suffer from a good deal and it is usually easily cured with the proper\ntreatment.",
    "It comes about because people have had too much mental strain too much worry have studied too\nmuch for examinations have dwelled too much perhaps on their emotions have too much religion or\nhave a lamentable lack of religion or have good reasons for hating their fathers or their mothers Or of\ncourse it can be as simple as having an unfortunate love affair.",
    "Ive got a stepmother.",
    "I hate her and I\nrather think I hate my father too.",
    "That seems rather a lot doesnt it It is more usual to hate one or the\nother said Poirot.",
    "You were I suppose very fond of your own mother.",
    "Is she divorced or dead\nDead.",
    "She died two or three years ago.",
    "And you cared for her very much Yes.",
    "I suppose I did.",
    "I\nmean of course I did.",
    "She was an invalid you know and i she had to go to nursing homes a good deal.",
    "And your father Father had gone abroad a long time before that.",
    "He went to South America when I\n\n\fwas about five or six.",
    "I think he wanted Mother to divorce him but she wouldnt.",
    "He went to South\nAmerica and was mixed up with mines or something like that.",
    "Anyway he used to write to me at\nChristmas and send me a Christmas present or arrange for one to come to me.",
    "That was about all.",
    "So he didnt really seem very real to me.",
    "He came home about a year ago because he\nhad to wind up my uncles affairs and all that sort of financial thing.",
    "And when he came home he \u2014 he\nbrought this new wife with him.",
    "And you resented the fact Yes I did.",
    "But your mother was dead\nby then.",
    "It is not unusual you know for a man to marry again.",
    "Especially when he and his wife have been\nestranged for many years.",
    "This wife he brought was she the same lady he had wished to marry previously when he asked your\nmother for a divorce Oh no this one is quite young.",
    "And shes very goodlooking and she acts as\nthough she just owns my father She went on after a pause\u2014in a different rather childish voice.",
    "I\nthought perhaps when he came home this time he would be fond of me and take notice of me and \u2014 but\nshe wont let him.",
    "Shes against me.",
    "Shes crowded me out.",
    "But that does not matter at all at the age\nyou are.",
    "It is a good thing.",
    "You do not need anyone to look after you now.",
    "You can stand on your own\nfeet you can enjoy life you can choose your own friends \u2014 You wouldnt think so the way they go on\nat home Well I mean to choose my own friends.",
    "Most girls nowadays have to endure criticism about\ntheir friends said Poirot.",
    "It was all so different said Norma.",
    "My father isnt at all like I remember him when I was five years old.",
    "He used to play with me all the\ntime and be so gay.",
    "Hes not gay now.",
    "Hes worried and rather fierce and \u2014 oh quite different.",
    "That must be nearly fifteen\nyears ago I presume.",
    "People change.",
    "But ought people to change so much Has he changed in\nappearance Oh no no not that.",
    "Oh no If you look at his picture just over his chair although its of\nhim when he was much younger its exactly like him now.",
    "But it isnt at all the way I remembered him.",
    "But you know my dear said Poirot gently people are never like what you remember them.",
    "You make\nthem as the years go by more and more the way you wish them to be and as you think you remember\nthem.",
    "If you want to remember them as agreeable and gay and handsome yw make them far more so\nthan they actually were.",
    "Do you think so Do you really think so She paused and then said abruptly\nBut why do you think I want to kill people The question came out quite naturally.",
    "It was there between\nthem.",
    "They had Poirot felt got at last to a crucial moment.",
    "That may be quite an interesting question said Poirot and there may be quite an interesting reason.",
    "The person who can probably tell you the answer to that will be a doctor.",
    "The kind of doctor who\nknows.",
    "She reacted quickly.",
    "I wont go to a doctor.",
    "I wont go near a doctor They wanted to send me to a doctor and then Ill be\nshut up in one of those loony places and they wont let me out again.",
    "Im not going to do anything like\nthat.",
    "She was struggling now to rise to her feet.",
    "It is not I who can send you to one\nYou need not be alarmed.",
    "You could go to a doctor entirely on your own behalf if you liked.",
    "You can go\n\n\fand say to him the things you have been saying to me and you may ask him why and he will perhaps tell\nyou the cause.",
    "Thats what David says.",
    "Thats what David says I should do but I dont think \u2014 I dont\nthink he understands.",
    "Id have to tell a doctor that I \u2014 I might have tried to do things... What makes\nyou think you have Because I dont always remember what Ive done \u2014 or where Ive been.",
    "I lose an\nhour of time \u2014 two hours \u2014 and I cant remember.",
    "I was in a corridor once \u2014 a corridor outside a\ndoor her door.",
    "Id something in my hand \u2014 I dont know how I got it.",
    "She came walking along towards\nme \u2014 But when she got near me her face changed.",
    "It wasnt her at all.",
    "Shed changed into somebody else.",
    "You are remembering perhaps a nightmare.",
    "There people do\nchange into somebody else.",
    "It wasnt a nightmare.",
    "I picked up the revolver \u2014 It was lying there at my\nfeet \u2014 In a corridor No in the courtyard.",
    "She came and took it away from me.",
    "Who did\nClaudia.",
    "She took me upstairs and gave me some bitter stuff to drink.",
    "Where was your stepmother\nthen She was there too\u2014 No she wasnt.",
    "She was at Crosshedges.",
    "Or in hospital.",
    "Thats where they found out she was being poisoned \u2014 and that it was me.",
    "It need not have been you\n\u2014 It could have been someone else.",
    "Who else could it have been Perhaps \u2014 her husband.",
    "Father Why on earth should Father want to poison Mary.",
    "Hes devoted to her.",
    "Hes silly about her There are others in the house are there not Old Uncle Roderick Nonsense\nOne does not know said Poirot he might be mentally afflicted.",
    "He might think it was his duty to\npoison a woman who might be a beautiful spy.",
    "Something like that.",
    "That would be very interesting\nsaid Norma momentarily diverted and speaking in a perfectly natural manner.",
    "Uncle Roderick was\nmixed up a good deal with spies and things in the last war.",
    "Who else is there Sonia I suppose she might\nbe a beautiful spy but shes not quite my idea of one.",
    "No and there does not seem very much reason\nwhy she should wish to poison your stepmother.",
    "I suppose there might be servants gardeners No\nthey just come in for the day.",
    "I dont think  well they wouldnt be the kind of people to have any reason.",
    "She might have done it\nherself.",
    "Committed suicide do you mean Like the other one It is a possibility.",
    "I cant imagine\nMary committing suicide.",
    "Shes far too sensible.",
    "And why should she want to Yes you feel that if she\ndid she would put her head in the gas oven or she would lie on a bed nicely arranged and take an\noverdose of sleeping draught.",
    "Is that right Well it would have been more natural.",
    "So you see said Norma earnestly it must have been me.",
    "Aha said Poirot that interests me.",
    "You would almost it would seem prefer that it should be you.",
    "You are attracted to the idea that it was\nyour hand who slipped the fatal dose of this that or the other.",
    "Yes you like the idea.",
    "How dare you say such a thing How can you Because I think it is true said\nPoirot.",
    "Why does the thought that you may have committed murder excite you please you Its not true.",
    "I\nwonder said Poirot.",
    "She scooped up her bag and began feeling in it with shaking fingers.",
    "Im not going to stop here and have you say these things to me.",
    "She signalled to the waitress who came\nscribbled on a pad of paper detached it and laid it down by Normas plate.",
    "Permit me said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He removed the slip of paper deftly and prepared to draw his notecase from his pocket.",
    "The girl\nsnatched it back again.",
    "No I wont let you pay for me.",
    "As you please said Poirot.",
    "He had seen what he wanted to see.",
    "The bill was for two.",
    "It would seem therefore that David of the fine feathers had no objection to having\nhis bills paid by an infatuated girl.",
    "So it is you who entertain a friend to elevenses I see.",
    "How did you know that I was with anyone I\ntell you I know a good deal.",
    "She placed coins on the table and rose.",
    "Im going now she said and I forbid you to follow me.",
    "I doubt if I could said Poirot.",
    "You must\nremember my advanced age.",
    "If you were to run down the street I should certainly not be able to follow\nyou.",
    "She got up and went towards the door.",
    "Do you hear You are not to follow me.",
    "You permit me at least to open the door for you.",
    "He did so\nwith something of a flourish.",
    "Au revoir Mademoiselle.",
    "She threw a suspicious glance at him and walked\naway down the street with a rapid step turning her head back over her shoulder from time to time.",
    "Poirot\nremained by the door watching her but made no attempt to gain the pavement or to catch her up.",
    "When\nshe was out of sight he turned back into the cafe.",
    "And what the devil does all that mean said Poirot to himself.",
    "The waitress was advancing upon him displeasure on her face.",
    "Poirot regained his seat at the table and\nplacated her by ordering a cup of coffee.",
    "There is something here very curious he murmured to himself.",
    "Yes something very curious indeed.",
    "A cup of pale beige fluid was placed in front of him.",
    "He took a sip\nof it and made a grimace.",
    "He wondered where Mrs. Oliver was at this moment.",
    "CHAPTER NINE\nMRS. OLIVER was seated in a bus.",
    "She was slightly out of breath though full of the zest of the chase.",
    "What she called in her own mind the Peacock had led a somewhat brisk pace.",
    "Mrs. Oliver was not a rapid walker.",
    "Going along the Embankment she followed him at a distance of some twenty yards or so.",
    "At Charing\nCross he got into the underground.",
    "Mrs. Oliver also got into the underground.",
    "At Sloane Square he got\nout so did Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She waited in a bus queue some three or four people behind him.",
    "He got on a\nbus and so did she.",
    "He got out at Worlds End so did Mrs.\n\n\fOliver.",
    "He plunged into a bewildering maze of streets between Kings Road and the river.",
    "He turned into\nwhat seemed a builders yard.",
    "Mrs. Oliver stood in the shadow of a doorway and watched.",
    "He turned\ninto an alleyway Mrs. Oliver gave him a moment or two and then followed \u2014 he was nowhere to be\nseen.",
    "Mrs. Oliver reconnoitred her general surroundings.",
    "The whole place appeared somewhat decrepit.",
    "She wandered farther down the alleyway.",
    "Other\nalleyways led off from it  some of them culsdesac.",
    "She had completely lost her sense of direction\nwhen she once more came to the builders yard and a voice spoke behind her startling her considerably.",
    "It said politely I hope I didnt walk too fast for you.",
    "She turned sharply.",
    "Suddenly what had recently\nbeen almost fun a chase undertaken lightheartedly and in the best of spirits now was that no longer.",
    "What she felt now was a sudden unexpected throb of fear.",
    "Yes she was afraid.",
    "The atmosphere had\nsuddenly become tinged with menace.",
    "Yet the voice was pleasant polite but behind it she knew there was anger.",
    "The sudden kind of anger that\nrecalled to her in a confused fashion all the things one read in newspapers.",
    "Elderly women attacked by\ngangs of young men.",
    "Young men who were ruthless cruel who were driven by hate and the desire to do\nharm.",
    "This was the young man whom she had been following.",
    "He had known she was there had given her the\nslip and had then followed her into this alleyway and he stood there now barring her way out.",
    "As is the precarious fashion of London one moment you are amongst people all round you and the next\nmoment there is nobody in sight.",
    "There must be people in the next street someone in the houses near but\nnearer than that is a masterful figure a figure with strong cruel hands.",
    "She felt sure that in this moment he was thinking of using those hands...",
    "The Peacock.",
    "A proud peacock.",
    "In his velvets his tight elegant black trousers speaking in that quiet ironical amused voice that held\nbehind it anger... Mrs. Oliver took three big gasps.",
    "Then in a lightning moment of decision she put up a\nquickly imagined defence.",
    "Firmly and immediately she sat on a dustbin which was against the wall quite\nclose to her.",
    "Goodness how you startled me she said.",
    "Id no idea you were there.",
    "I hope youre not annoyed.",
    "So\nyou were following me Yes Im afraid I was.",
    "I expect it must have been rather annoying to you.",
    "You\nsee I thought it would be such an excellent opportunity.",
    "Im sure youre frightfully angry but you neednt\nbe you know.",
    "Not really.",
    "You see Mrs. Oliver settled herself more firmly on the dustbin you see I\nwrite books.",
    "I write detective stories and Ive really been very worried this morning.",
    "In fact I went into a\ncafe to have a cup of coffee just to try and think things out.",
    "Id just got to the point in my book where I\nwas following somebody.",
    "I mean my hero was following someone and I thought to myself really I know\nvery little about following people.",
    "I mean Im always using the phrase in a book and Ive read a lot of\nbooks where people do follow other people and I wondered if it was as easy as it seems to be in some\npeoples books or if it was as almost entirely impossible as it seemed in other peoples books.",
    "So I\nthought Well really the only thing was to try it out myself  because until you try things out yourself you\ncant really tell what its like.",
    "I mean you dont know what you feel like or whether you get worried at\nlosing a person.",
    "As it happened I just looked up and you were sitting at the next table to me in the cafe\nand I thought youd be  I hope you wont be annoyed again  but I thought youd be an especially\ngood person to follow.",
    "He was still staring at her with those strange cold blue eyes yet she felt\nsomehow that the tension had left them.",
    "Why was I an especially good person to follow Well you were so decorative explained Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "They are really very attractive clothes  almost Regency you know and I thought well I might\n\n\ftake advantage of your being fairly easy to distinguish from other people.",
    "So you see when you went out\nof the cafe I went out too.",
    "And its not really easy at all.",
    "She looked up at him.",
    "Do you mind telling me if\nyou knew I was there all the time Not at once no.",
    "I see said Mrs. Oliver thoughtfully.",
    "But of course Im not as distinctive as you are.",
    "I mean you wouldnt be able to tell me very easily from a\nlot of other elderly women.",
    "I dont stand out very much do I Do you write books that are published\nHave I ever come across them Well I dont know.",
    "You may have.",
    "Ive written fortythree by now.",
    "My names Oliver.",
    "Ariadne Oliver So you do know my name said\nMrs.\nOliver.",
    "Well thats rather gratifying of course though I daresay you wouldnt like my books very much.",
    "You probably would find them rather oldfashioned not violent enough.",
    "You didnt know me\npersonally beforehand  Mrs. Oliver shook her head.",
    "No Im sure I dont  didnt I mean.",
    "What\nabout the girl I was with You mean the one you were having  baked beans was it  with in the cafe\nNo I dont think so.",
    "Of course I only saw the back of her head.",
    "She looked to me  well I mean girls\ndo look rather alike dont they She knew you said the boy suddenly.",
    "His tone in a moment had a sudden acid sharpness.",
    "She mentioned once that shed met you not long\nago.",
    "About a week ago I believe.",
    "Where Was it at a party I suppose I might have met her.",
    "Whats\nher name\nPerhaps Id know that.",
    "She thought he was in two moods whether to mention the name or not but he\ndecided to and he watched her face very keenly as he did so.",
    "Her names Norma Restarick.",
    "Norma Restarick.",
    "Oh of course yes it was at a party in the country.",
    "A\nplace called  wait a minute  Long Norton was it  I dont remember the name of the house.",
    "I went\nthere with some friends.",
    "I dont think I would have recognised her anyway though I believe she did say something about my\nbooks.",
    "I even promised Id give her one.",
    "Its very odd isnt it that I should make up my mind and\nactually choose to follow a person who was sitting with somebody I more or less knew.",
    "Very odd.",
    "I dont think I could put anything like that in my book.",
    "It would look rather too much of a\ncoincidence dont you think Mrs. Oliver rose from her seat.",
    "Good gracious what have I been sitting\non A dustbin Really Not a very nice dustbin either.",
    "She sniffed.",
    "What is this place Ive got to David\nwas looking at her.",
    "She felt suddenly that she was completely mistaken in everything she had previously\nthought.",
    "Absurd of me thought Mrs. Oliver absurd of me.",
    "Thinking that he was dangerous that he might do\nsomething to me.",
    "He was smiling at her with an extraordinary charm.",
    "He moved his head slightly and his\nchestnut ringlets moved on his shoulders.",
    "What fantastic creatures there were in the way of young men\nnowadays\nThe least I can do he said is to show you I think where youve been brought to just by following\nme.",
    "Come on up these stairs.",
    "He indicated a ramshackle outside staircase running up to what seemed to\nbe a loft.",
    "Up those stairs Mrs. Oliver was not so certain about this.",
    "Perhaps he was trying to lure her up there\n\n\fwith his charm and he would then knock her on the head.",
    "Its no good Ariadne said Mrs. Oliver to herself youve got yourself into this spot and now youve\ngot to go on with it and find out what you can find out.",
    "Do you think theyll stand my weight she said\nthey look frightfully rickety.",
    "Theyre quite all right.",
    "Ill go up first he said and show you the way.",
    "Mrs. Oliver mounted the ladderlike stairs behind him.",
    "It was no good.",
    "She was deep down still\nfrightened.",
    "Frightened not so much of the Peacock as frightened of where the Peacock might be taking\nher.",
    "Well shed know very soon.",
    "He pushed open the door at the top and went into a room.",
    "It was a large bare room and it was an\nartists studio an improvised kind of one.",
    "A few matresses lay here and there on the floor there were\ncanvases stacked against the wall a couple of easels.",
    "There was a pervading smell of paint.",
    "There were\ntwo people in the room a bearded young man was standing at an easel painting.",
    "He turned his head as\nthey entered.",
    "Hallo David he said bringing us company He was Mrs. Oliver thought quite the dirtiestlooking\nyoung man shed ever seen.",
    "Oily black hair hung in a kind of circular bob down the back of his neck and over his eyes in front.",
    "His\nface apart from the beard was unshaven and his clothes seemed mainly composed of greasy black\nleather and high boots.",
    "Mrs. Olivers glance went beyond him to a girl who was acting as a model.",
    "She\nwas on a wooden chair on a dais half flung across it her head back and her dark hair drooping down\nfrom it.",
    "Mrs. Oliver recognised her at once.",
    "It was the second one of the three girls in Borodene Mansions.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver couldnt remember her last name but she remembered her first one.",
    "It was the highly decorative\nand languidlooking girl called Frances.",
    "Meet Peter said David indicating the somewhat revolting looking artist.",
    "One of our budding geniuses.",
    "And Frances who is posing as a desperate girl demanding abortion.",
    "Shut up you ape said Peter.",
    "I believe I know you dont I said Mrs. Oliver cheerfully without any air of conscious certainty.",
    "Im\nsure Ive met you somewhere Somewhere quite lately too.",
    "Youre Mrs. Oliver arent you said\nFrances.",
    "Thats what she said she was said David.",
    "True too is it Now where did I meet you continued\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "Some party was it\nNo.",
    "Let me think.",
    "I know.",
    "It was Borodene Mansions.",
    "Frances was sitting up now in her chair and\nspeaking in weary but elegant tones.",
    "Peter uttered a loud and miserable groan.",
    "Now youve ruined the pose Do you have to have all this wriggling about\nCant you keep still No I couldnt any longer.",
    "It was an awful pose.",
    "Ive got the most frightful crick in\nmy shoulder.",
    "Ive been making experiments in following people said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Its much more\ndifficult than I thought.",
    "Is this an artists studio she added looking round her brightly.",
    "Thats what theyre like nowadays a kind of loft  and lucky if you dont fall through the floor said\nPeter.",
    "Its got all you need said David.",
    "Its got a north light and plenty of room and a pad to sleep on and a fourth share in the loo downstairs\n and what they call cooking facilities.",
    "And its got a bottle or two he added.",
    "Turning to Mrs. Oliver\nbut in an entirely different tone one of utter politeness he said And can we offer you a drink I dont\ndrink said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "The lady doesnt drink said David.",
    "Who would have thought it Thats rather\nrude but youre quite right said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Most people come up to me and say I always thought you\ndrank like a fish.",
    "She opened her handbag  and immediately three coils of grey hair fell on the floor.",
    "David picked them up and handed them to her.",
    "Oh thank you.",
    "Mrs. Oliver took them.",
    "I hadnt time this morning.",
    "I wonder if Ive got any more\nhairpins.",
    "She delved in her bag and started attaching the coils to her head.",
    "Peter roared with laughter  Bully for you he said.",
    "How extraordinary Mrs. Oliver thought to herself that I should ever have had this silly idea that I was\nin danger.",
    "Danger  from these people No matter what they look like theyre really very nice and\nfriendly.",
    "Its quite true what people always say to me.",
    "Ive far too much imagination.",
    "Presently she said\nshe must be going and David with Regency gallantry helped her down the rickety steps and gave her\ndefinite directions as to how to rejoin the Kings Road in the quickest way.",
    "And then he said you can get a bus  or a taxi if you want it.",
    "A taxi said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "My feet are\nabsolutely dead.",
    "The sooner I fall into a taxi the better.",
    "Thank you she added for being so very nice\nabout my following you in what must have seemed a very peculiar way.",
    "Though after all I dont suppose\nprivate detectives or private eyes or whatever they call them would look anything at all like me.",
    "Perhaps not said David gravely.",
    "Left here \u2014 and then right and then left again until you see the river and go towards it and then sharp\nright and straight on.",
    "Curiously enough as she walked across the shabby yard the same feeling of unease\nand suspense came over her.",
    "I mustnt let my imagination go again.",
    "She looked back at the steps and\nthe window of the studio.",
    "The figure of David still stood looking after her.",
    "Three perfectly nice young\npeople said Mrs Oliver to herself.",
    "Perfectly nice and very kind.",
    "Left here and then right.",
    "Just because they look rather peculiar one goes\nand has silly ideas about their being dangerous.",
    "Was it right again or left Left I think \u2014 Oh goodness\nmy feet.",
    "Its going to rain too.",
    "The walk seemed endless and the Kings Road incredibly far away.",
    "She\ncould hardly hear the traffic now  and where on earth was the river She began to suspect that she had\nfollowed the directions wrong.",
    "Oh well thought Mrs. Oliver Im bound to get somewhere soon  the river or Putney or\nWandsworth or somewhere.",
    "She asked her way to the Kings Road from a passing man who said he\nwas a foreigner and didnt speak English.",
    "Mrs. Oliver turned another corner wearily and there ahead of her was the gleam of the water.",
    "She\nhurried towards it down a narrow passageway heard a footstep behind her half turned when she was\nstruck from behind and the world went up in sparks.",
    "CHAPTER TEN\nDrink this.",
    "Norma was shivering.",
    "Her eyes had a dazed look.",
    "She shrank back a little in the chair.",
    "The\n\n\fcommand was repeated.",
    "Drink this.",
    "This time she drank obediently then choked a little.",
    "Its  its very strong she gasped.",
    "Itll put you right.",
    "Youll feel better in a minute.",
    "Just sit still and wait.",
    "The sickness and the giddiness\nwhich had been confusing her passed off.",
    "A little colour came into her cheeks and the shivering\ndiminished.",
    "For the first time she looked round her noting her surroundings.",
    "She had been obsessed by a feeling of fear and horror but now things seemed to be returning to normal.",
    "It was a mediumsized room and it was furnished in a way that seemed faintly familiar.",
    "A desk a couch\nan armchair and an ordinary chair a stethoscope on a side table and some machine that she thought had\nto do with eyes.",
    "Then her attention went from the general to the particular.",
    "The man who had told her to\ndrink.",
    "She saw a man of perhaps thirtyodd with red hair and a rather attractively ugly face the kind of face that\nis craggy but interesting.",
    "He nodded at her in a reassuring fashion.",
    "Beginning to get your bearings I  I think so.",
    "I  did you  what happened Dont you\nremember The traffic.",
    "I  it came at me  it   She looked at him.I was run over.",
    "Oh no you\nwerent run over.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "I saw to that.",
    "You Well there you were in the middle of the\nroad a car bearing down on you and I just managed to snatch you out of its way.",
    "What were you\nthinking of to go running into the traffic like that I cant remember.",
    "I  yes I suppose I must have been\nthinking of something else.",
    "A Jaguar was coming pretty fast and there was a bus bearing down on the\nother side of the road.",
    "The car wasnt trying to run you down or anything like that was it I \u2014 no no\nIm sure it wasnt.",
    "I mean I\u2014 Well I wondered\u2014It just might have been something else mightnt it\nWhat do you mean Well it could have been deliberate you know.",
    "What do you mean by\ndeliberate Actually I just wondered whether you were trying to get yourself killed He added\ncasually Were you I \u2014 no \u2014 well \u2014 no of course not.",
    "Damn silly way to do it if so.",
    "His tone\nchanged slightly.",
    "Come now you must remember something about it.",
    "She began shivering again.",
    "I\nthought \u2014 I thought it would be all over.",
    "I thought \u2014  So you were trying to kill yourself werent you\nWhats the matter You can tell me.",
    "Boy friend That can make one feel pretty bad.",
    "Besides theres\nalways the hopeful thought that if you kill yourself you make him sorry \u2014 but one should never trust to\nthat.",
    "People dont like feeling sorry or feeling anything is their fault.",
    "All the boy friend will probably say I\nalways thought she was unbalanced.",
    "Its really all for the best.",
    "Just remember that next time you have an urge to charge Jaguars.",
    "Even Jaguars\nhave feelings to be considered.",
    "Was that the trouble Boy friend walk out on you No said Norma.",
    "Oh no.",
    "It was quite the opposite.",
    "She added suddenly He wanted to marry me.",
    "Thats no reason for\nthrowing yourself down in front of a Jaguar.",
    "Yes it is.",
    "I did it because\u2014 She stopped.",
    "Youd better tell me about it hadnt you How did I get here asked Norma.",
    "I brought you here in a taxi.",
    "You didnt seem injured \u2014 a few bruises I expect.",
    "You merely looked\nshaken to death and in a state of shock I asked you your address but you looked at me as though you\ndidnt know what I was talking about.",
    "A crowd was about to collect.",
    "So I hailed a taxi and brought you here.",
    "Is this a \u2014 a doctors surgery\nThis is a doctors consulting room and Im the doctor.",
    "Stillingfleet my name is.",
    "I dont want to see a\ndoctor I dont want to talk to a doctor I dont \u2014  Calm down calm down.",
    "Youve been talking to a\ndoctor for the last ten minutes.",
    "Whats the matter with doctors anyway Tin afraid.",
    "Im afraid a doctor would say  Come now my\ndear girl youre not consulting me professionally.",
    "Regard me as a mere outsider whos been enough of a\nbusybody to save you from being killed or what is far more likely having a broken arm or a fractured leg\nor a head injury or something extremely unpleasant which might incapacitate you for life.",
    "There are other\ndisadvantages.",
    "Formerly if you deliberately tried to commit suicide you could be had up in Court.",
    "You\nstill can if its a suicide pact.",
    "There now you cant say I havent been frank.",
    "You could oblige now by being frank with me and telling\nme why on earth youre afraid of doctors.",
    "Whats a doctor ever done to you Nothing.",
    "Nothing has\nbeen done to me.",
    "But Im afraid that they might   Might what Shut me up.",
    "Dr. Stillingfleet raised his sandy eyebrows\nand looked at her.",
    "Well well he said.",
    "You seem to have some very curious ideas about doctors.",
    "Why should I want to shut you up\nWould you like a cup of tea he added or would you prefer a purple heart or a tranquilliser.",
    "Thats the\nkind of thing people of your age go in for.",
    "Done a bit yourself in that line havent you She shook her\nhead.",
    "Not  not really.",
    "I dont believe you.",
    "Anyway why the alarm and despondency Youre not\nreally mental are you I shouldnt have said so.",
    "Doctors arent at all anxious to have people shut up.",
    "Mental homes are far too full already.",
    "Difficult to\nsqueeze in another body.",
    "In fact lately theyve been letting a good many people out  in desperation pushing them out you might say  who jolly well ought to have been kept in.",
    "Everythings so overcrowded in this country.",
    "Well he went on what are your tastes Something out of my drug cupboard or a good solid\noldfashioned English cup of tea I  Id like some tea said Norma.",
    "Indian or China Thats the thing to ask isnt it Mind you Im not sure if Ive got any China.",
    "I like\nIndian better.",
    "Good he went to the door opened it and shouted Annie.",
    "Pot of tea for two.",
    "He came\nback and sat down and said Now you get this quite clear young lady.",
    "Whats your name by the way Norma Res \u2014  she stopped.",
    "Yes Norma West.",
    "Well Miss West lets get this clear.",
    "Im not treating you youre not consulting me.",
    "You are the victim of a street accident \u2014 that is the way\nwell put it and that is the way I suppose you meant it to appear which would have been pretty hard on\nthe fellow in the Jaguar.",
    "I thought of throwing myself off a bridge first.",
    "Did you You wouldnt have\nfound that so easy.",
    "People who build bridges are rather careful nowadays.",
    "I mean youd have had to\nclimb up on to the parapet and its not so easy.",
    "Somebody stops you.",
    "Well to continue with my dissertation I brought you home as you were in too much of a state of shock\nto tell me your address.",
    "What is it by the way I havent got an address.",
    "I \u2014 I dont live anywhere.",
    "Interesting said Dr.\nStillingfleet.",
    "What the police call of no fixed abode5.",
    "What do you do  sit out on the Embankment all night She looked at him suspiciously.",
    "I could have reported the accident to the police but there was no obligation upon me to do so.",
    "I\npreferred to take the view that in a state of maiden meditation you were crossing the street before looking\nleft first.",
    "Youre not at all like my idea of a doctor said Norma.",
    "Really Well Ive been getting gradually disillusioned in my profession in this country.",
    "In fact Im giving\nup my practice here and Im going to Australia in about a fortnight.",
    "So youre quite safe from me and you\ncan if you like tell me how you see pink elephants walking out of the wall how you think the trees are\nleaning out their branches to wrap round and strangle you how you think you know just when the devil\nlooks out of peoples eyes or any other cheerful fantasy and I shant do a thing about it You look sane\nenough if I may say so.",
    "I dont think I am.",
    "Well you may be right said Dr. Stillingfleet handsomely.",
    "Lets hear what your reasons are.",
    "I do things and dont remember about them...",
    "I tell people things\nabout what Ive done but I dont remember telling them...",
    "It sounds as though you have a bad memory.",
    "You dont understand.",
    "Theyre all \u2014 wicked things.",
    "Religious mania Now that would be very\ninteresting.",
    "Its not religious.",
    "Its just \u2014 just hate.",
    "There was a tap at the door and an elderly woman\ncame in with a tea tray.",
    "She put it down on the desk and went out again.",
    "Sugar said Dr. Stillingfleet.",
    "Yes please.",
    "Sensible girl.",
    "Sugar is very good for you when youve had a shock.",
    "He poured out two\ncups of tea set hers at her side and placed the sugar basin beside it.",
    "Now then he sat down.",
    "What\nwere we talking about Oh yes hate.",
    "It is possible isnt it that you could hate someone so much that\nyou really want to kill them Oh yes said Stillingfleet cheerfully still.",
    "Perfectly possible.",
    "In fact most\nnatural.",
    "But even if you really want to do it you cant always screw yourself up to the point you know.",
    "The human being is equipped with a natural braking system and it applies the brakes for you just at the\nright moment.",
    "You make it sound so ordinary said Norma.",
    "There was a distinct overtone of\nannoyance in her voice.",
    "Oh well it is quite natural.",
    "Children feel like it almost every day.",
    "Lose their tempers say to their\nmothers or their fathers Youre wicked I hate you I wish you were dead.",
    "Mothers being sometimes\nsensible people dont usually pay any attention.",
    "When you grow up you still hate people but you cant\ntake quite so much trouble wanting to kill them by then.",
    "Or if you still do \u2014 well then you go to prison.",
    "That is if you actually brought yourself to do such a messy and difficult job.",
    "You arent putting all this on\nare you by the way he asked casually.",
    "Of course not.",
    "Norma sat up straight.",
    "Her eyes flashed with anger.",
    "Of course not.",
    "Do you think I would say such awful things if they werent true Well again said Dr.\nStillingfleet people do.",
    "They say all sorts of awful things about themselves and enjoy saying them.",
    "He\ntook her empty cup from her.",
    "Now then he said youd better tell me all about everything.",
    "Who you hate why you hate them what\nyoud like to do to them.",
    "Love can turn to hate.",
    "Sounds like a melodramatic ballad.",
    "But remember\nhate can turn to love too.",
    "It works both ways.",
    "And you say its not a boy friend.",
    "He was your man and\nhe did you wrong.",
    "None of that stuff eh No no.",
    "Nothing like that.",
    "Its  its my stepmother.",
    "The\ncruel stepmother motif.",
    "But thats nonsense.",
    "At your age you can get away from a stepmother.",
    "What has\nshe done to you beside marrying your father Do you hate him too or are you so devoted to him that\n\n\fyou dont want to share him Its not like that at all.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I used to love him once.",
    "I loved him\ndearly.",
    "He was  he was  I thought he was wonderful.",
    "Now then said Dr. Stillingfleet listen to me.",
    "Im going to suggest something.",
    "You see that door Norma turned her head and looked in a puzzled fashion at the door.",
    "Perfectly ordinary door isnt it Not locked.",
    "Opens and shuts in the ordinary way.",
    "Go on try it for\nyourself.",
    "You saw my housekeeper come in and go out through it didnt you No illusions.",
    "Come on.",
    "Get up.",
    "Do what I tell you.",
    "Norma rose from her chair and rather hesitatingly went to the door and\nopened it.",
    "She stood in the aperture her head turned towards him enquiringly.",
    "Right.",
    "What do you see A perfectly ordinary hallway wants redecorating but its not worth having it\ndone when Im just off to Australia.",
    "Now go to the front door open it also no tricks about it.",
    "Go outside\nand down to the pavement and that will show you that you are perfectly free with no attempts to shut you\nup in any way.",
    "After that when you have satisfied yourself that you could walk out of this place at any\nminute you like come back sit in that comfortable chair over there and tell me all about yourself.",
    "After\nwhich I will give you my valuable advice.",
    "You neednt take it he added consolingly.",
    "People seldom do\ntake advice but you might as well have it.",
    "See Agreed Norma got up slowly she went a little shakily\nout of the room out into  as the doctor had described  the perfectly ordinary hallway opened the\nfront door with a simple catch down four steps and stood on the pavement in a street of decorous but\nrather uninteresting houses.",
    "She stood there a moment unaware that she was being watched through a\nlace blind by Dr.\nStillingfleet himself.",
    "She stood there for about two minutes then with a slightly more resolute bearing she\nturned went up the steps again shut the front door and came back into the room.",
    "All right said Dr. Stillingfleet.",
    "Satisfy you theres nothing up my sleeve All clear and above board.5\nThe girl nodded.",
    "Right.",
    "Sit down there.",
    "Make yourself comfortable.",
    "Do you smoke Well I   Only reefers something of that kind\nNever mind you neednt tell me.",
    "Of course I dont take anything of that kind.",
    "I shouldnt have said\nthere was any of course about it but one must believe what the patient tells one.",
    "All right.",
    "Now tell me\nall about yourself.",
    "I \u2014 I dont know.",
    "Theres nothing to tell really.",
    "Dont you want me to lie down on a\ncouch Oh you mean your memory of dreams and all that stuff No not particularly.",
    "I just like to get a\nbackground.",
    "You know.",
    "You were born you lived in the country or the town you have brothers and sisters or youre an only\nchild and so on.",
    "When your own mother died were you very upset by her death Of course I was.",
    "Norma sounded indignant.",
    "Youre much too fond of saying of course.",
    "Miss West.",
    "By the way.",
    "West isnt really your name is it\nOh never mind I dont want to know any other one.",
    "Call yourself West or East or North or anything\nyou like.",
    "Anyway what went on after your mother died She was an invalid for a long time before she\ndied.",
    "In nursing homes a good deal.",
    "I stayed with an aunt rather an old aunt down in Devonshire.",
    "She\nwasnt really an aunt she was Mothers first cousin.",
    "And then my father came home just about six months\n\n\fago.",
    "It  it was wonderful.",
    "Her face lighted up suddenly.",
    "She was unaware of the quick shrewed\nglance the apparently casual young man shot at her.",
    "I could hardly remember him you know.",
    "He must\nhave gone away when I was about five.",
    "I didnt really think Id ever see him again.",
    "Mother didnt very often talk about him.",
    "I think at first she\nhoped that hed give up this other woman and come back.",
    "Other woman Yes.",
    "He went away with\nsomeone.",
    "She was a very bad woman.",
    "Mother said.",
    "Mother talked about her very bitterly and very bitterly about Father too but I used to think that perhaps\n perhaps Father wasnt as bad as she thought that it was all this womans fault.",
    "Did they marry No.",
    "Mother said she would never divorce Father.",
    "She was ais it an Anglican  very High Church you\nknow.",
    "Rather like a Roman Catholic.",
    "She didnt believe in divorce.",
    "Did they go on living together\nWhat was the womans name or is that a secret too I dont remember her last name.",
    "Norma shook\nher head.",
    "No I dont think they lived together long but I dont know much about it all you see.",
    "They\nwent to South Africa but I think they quarrelled and parted quite soon because thats when Mother said\nshe hoped Father might come back again.",
    "But he didnt.",
    "He didnt write even.",
    "Not even to me.",
    "But he\nsent me things at Christmas.",
    "Presents always.",
    "He was fond of you I dont know.",
    "How could I tell\nNobody ever spoke about him.",
    "Only Uncle Simon  his brother you know.",
    "He was in business in the City and he was very angry that Father had chucked up everything.",
    "He said he\nhad always been the same could never settle to anything but he said he wasnt a bad chap really.",
    "He\nsaid he was just weak.",
    "I didnt often see Uncle Simon.",
    "It was always Mothers friends.",
    "Most of them were dreadfully dull.",
    "My whole life has been very dull.",
    "Oh it seemed so wonderful that Father was really coming home.",
    "I tried to remember him better.",
    "You\nknow things he had said games he had played with me.",
    "He used to make me laugh a lot.",
    "I tried to see if\nI couldnt find some old snapshots or photographs of him.",
    "They seem all to have been thrown away.",
    "I\nthink Mother must have torn them all up.",
    "She had remained vindictive then.",
    "I think it was really Louise\nshe was vindictive against.",
    "Louise He saw a slight stiffening on the girls part.",
    "I dont remember \u2014 I told you \u2014 I dont remember any names.",
    "Never mind.",
    "Youre talking about the\nwoman your father ran away with.",
    "Is that it Yes.",
    "Mother said she drank too much and took drugs and\nwould come to a bad end.",
    "But you dont know whether she did c dont know anything....",
    "Her\nemotion was rising.",
    "I wish you wouldnt ask me questions I dont know anything about her I never\nheard other again Id forgotten her until you spoke about her.",
    "I tell you I dont know anything.",
    "Well\nwell said Dr. Stillingfleet.",
    "Dont get so agitated.",
    "You dont need to bother about past history.",
    "Lets think about the future.",
    "What\nare you going to do next Norma gave a deep sigh.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Ive nowhere to go.",
    "I cant  its much better  Im sure its much better to  to end it all\n only   Only you cant make the attempt a second time is that it It would be very foolish if you did\nI can tell you that my girl.",
    "All right youve nowhere to go no one to trust got any money Yes Ive\ngot a banking account and Father pays so much into it every quarter but Im not sure...",
    "I think perhaps\nby now they might be looking for me.",
    "dont want to be found.",
    "You neednt be.",
    "Ill fix that up for you\nall right.",
    "Place called Kenway Court.",
    "Not as fine as it sounds.",
    "Its a kind of convalescent nursing home\nwhere people go for a rest cure.",
    "Its got no doctors or couches and you wont be shut up there I can\npromise you.",
    "You can walk out any time you like.",
    "You can have breakfast in bed stay in bed all day if\nyou like.",

    "We havent rushed things and I dont want to startle her.",
    "A father complex as a child.",
    "Id say didnt care much for her mother who sounds a grim woman by all\naccounts \u2014 the selfrighteous martyr type.",
    "Id say Father was a gay one and couldnt quite stand the\ngrimness of married life\u2014 Know of anyone called Louise...",
    "The name seemed to frighten her \u2014 She\nwas the girls first hate I should say.",
    "She took Father away at the time the child was five.",

    "The voice at the other end of\nthe wire said sharply What is that you say Say it again.",
    "I said Im giving you roughly the picture.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "By the way heres one little fact might interest you.",
    "The girl made a rather hamhanded attempt to commit\nsuicide.",
    "Does that startle you.",
    "Oh it doesnt... No she didnt swallow the aspirin bottle or put her head in the gas oven.",
    "She rushed\ninto the traffic in the path of a Jaguar going faster than it should have done...",
    "I can tell you I only got to\nher just in time...",
    "Yes Id say it was a genuine impulse... She admitted it.",
    "Usual classic phrase  she wanted to get out of it all.",
    "He listened to a rapid flow of words then he\nsaid I dont know.",
    "At this stage I cant be sure  The picture presented is clear.",
    "A nervy girl neurotic\nand in an overwrought state from taking drugs of too many kinds.",
    "No I couldnt tell you definitely what\nkind.",
    "There are dozens of these things going about all producing slightly different effects.",
    "There can be\nconfusion loss of memory aggression bewilderment or sheer fuzzleheadedness\nThe difficulty is to tell what the real reactions are as opposed to the reactions produced by drugs.",
    "There\nare two choices ou see.",
    "Either this is a girl who is playing herself up depicting herself as neurotic and\n\n\fnervy and claiming suicidal tendencies.",
    "It could be actually so.",
    "Or it could be a whole pack of lies.",
    "I wouldnt put it past her to be putting up this\nstory for some obscure reason of her own \u2014 wanting to give an entirely false impression of herself.",
    "If so shes doing it very cleverly.",
    "Every now and then there seems something not quite right in the picture\nshes giving.",
    "Is she a very clever little actress acting a part\nOr is she a genuine semimoronic suicidal victim She could be either... What did you say... Oh the\nJaguar...",
    "Yes it was being driven far too fast.",
    "You think it mightnt have been an attempt at suicide\nThat the Jaguar was deliberately meaning to run her down P He thought for a minute or two.",
    "I cant\nsay he said slowly.",
    "It just could be so.",
    "Yes it could be so but I hadnt thought of it that way.",
    "The trouble is everythings possible isnt it\nAnyway Im going to get more out of her shortly.",
    "Ive got her in a position where shes semiwilling to\ntrust me so long as I dont go too far too quickly and make her suspicious.",
    "Shell become more trusting\nsoon and tell me more and if shes a genuine case shell pour out her whole story to me \u2014 force it on\nme in the end.",
    "At the moment shes frightened of something.",
    "If of course shes leading me up the garden path well have to find out the reason why.",
    "Shes at\nKenway Court and I think shell stay there.",
    "Id suggest that you keep someone with an eye on it for a day\nor so and if she does attempt to leave someone she doesnt know by sight had better follow her.",
    "CHAPTER ELEVEN\nANDREW RESTARICK was writing a cheque  he made a slight grimace as he did so.",
    "His office was large and handsomely furnished in typical conventional tycoon fashion  the furnishing and\nfittings had been Simon Restaricks and Andrew Restarick had accepted them without interest and had\nmade few changes except for removing a couple of pictures and replacing them by his own portrait which\nhe had brought up from the country and a water colour of Table Mountain.",
    "Andrew Restarick was a man of middle age beginning to put on flesh yet strangely little changed from\nthe man some fifteen years younger in the picture hanging above him.",
    "There was the same jutting out chin\nthe lips firmly pressed together and the slightly raised quizzical eyebrows.",
    "Not a very noticeable man an ordinary type and at the moment not a very happy man.",
    "His secretary entered the room  she advanced towards his desk as he looked up.",
    "A Monsieur Hercule Poirot is here.",
    "He insists that he has an appointment with you  but I can find no\ntrace of one.",
    "A Monsieur Hercule Poirot The name seemed vaguely familiar but he could not\nremember in what context.",
    "He shook his head  I cant remember anything about him  though I seem\nto have heard the name.",
    "What does he look like A very small man  foreign  French I should say with an enormous moustache   Of course I remember Mary describing him.",
    "He came to see old\nRoddy.",
    "But whats all this about an appointment with me.",
    "He says you wrote him a letter.",
    "Cant\nremember it  even if I did.",
    "Perhaps Mary  Oh well never mind  bring him in.",
    "I suppose Id better see what this is all about.",
    "A\nmoment or two later Claudia ReeceHolland returned ushering with her a small man with an eggshaped\nhead large moustaches pointed patent leather shoes and a general air of complacency which accorded\n\n\fvery well with the description he had had from his wife.",
    "Monsieur Hercule Poirot said Claudia ReeceHolland.",
    "She went out again as Hercule Poirot advanced towards the desk.",
    "Restarick rose.",
    "Monsieur Restarick I am Hercule Poirot at your service.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "My wife mentioned that youd\ncalled upon us or rather called upon my uncle.",
    "What can I do for you I have presented myself in\nanswer to your letter.",
    "What letter I did not write to you M. Poirot.",
    "Poirot stared at him.",
    "Then he\ndrew from his pocket a letter unfolded it glanced at it and handed it across the desk with a bow.",
    "See for yourself.",
    "Monsieur.",
    "Restarick stared at it.",
    "It was typewritten on his own office stationery.",
    "His\nsignature was written in ink at the bottom.",
    "Dear Monsieur Poirot I should be very glad if you could call upon me at the above address at your\nearliest convenience.",
    "I understand from what my wife tells me and also from what I have learned by\nmaking various enquiries in London that you are a man to be trusted when you agree to accept a mission\nthat demands discretion.",
    "Yours truly Andrew Restarick He said sharply When did you receive this This morning.",
    "I had no\nmatters of moment on my hands so I came along here.",
    "This is an extraordinary thing M.\nPoirot.",
    "That letter was not written by me.",
    "Not written by you No.",
    "My signature is quite different \u2014\nlook for yourself.",
    "He cast out a hand as though looking for some example of his handwriting and without\nconscious thought turned the cheque book on which he had just written his signature so that Poirot could\nsee it.",
    "You see The signature on the letter is not in the least like mine.",
    "But that is extraordinary said\nPoirot.",
    "Absolutely extraordinary.",
    "Who could have written this letter Thats just what Im asking myself.",
    "It\ncould not \u2014 excuse me \u2014 have been your wife No no.",
    "Mary would never do a thing like that.",
    "And\nanyway why should she sign it with my name Oh no she would have told me if shed done so prepared\nme for your visit.",
    "Then you have no idea why anyone might have sent this letter No indeed.",
    "Have\nyou no knowledge Mr. Restarick as to what the matter might be on which in this letter you apparently\nwant to engage me How could I have an idea Excuse me said Poirot you have not yet\ncompletely read this letter.",
    "You will notice at the bottom of the first page after the signature there is a\nsmall p.t.o.",
    "Restarick turned the letter over.",
    "At the top of the next page the typewriting continued.",
    "The matter on which I wish to consult you concerns my daughter Norma.",
    "Restaricks manner changed.",
    "His face darkened.",
    "So thats it But who could know \u2014 who could possibly meddle in this matter.",
    "Who knows about it Could it be a way of urging you to consult me Some wellmeaning friend\nYou have really no idea who the writer may have been Ive no idea whatever.",
    "And you are not in\ntrouble over a daughter of yours  a daughter named Norma Restarick said slowly I have a daughter\nnamed Norma.",
    "My only daughter.",
    "His voice changed slightly as he said the last words.",
    "And she is in trouble difficulty of some kind Not that I know of.",
    "But he hesitated slightly as he spoke\nthe words.",
    "Poirot leaned forward.",
    "I dont think that is exactly right Mr.\nRestarick.",
    "I think there is some trouble or difficulty concerning your daughter.",
    "Why should you think\nthat Has someone spoken to you on the subject  I was going entirely by your intonation Monsieur.",
    "Many people added Hercule Poirot are in trouble over daughters at the present date.",
    "They have a\ngenius young ladies for getting into various kinds of trouble and difficulty.",
    "It is possible that the same\nobtains here.",
    "Restarick was silent for some few moments drumming with his fingers on the desk.",
    "Yes I am worried about Norma he said at last.",
    "She is a difficult girl.",
    "Neurotic inclined to be\nhysterical.",
    "I  unfortunately I dont know her very well.",
    "Trouble no doubt over a young man In a\nway yes but that is not entirely what is worrying me.",
    "I think  he looked appraisingly at Poirot.",
    "Am I\nto take it that you are a man of discretion I should be very little good in my profession if I were not.",
    "It is a case you see of wanting my daughter found.",
    "Ah She came home last weekend as she usually\ndoes to our house in the country.",
    "She went back on Sunday night ostensibly to the flat which she occupies in common with two other girls\nbut I now find that she did not go there.",
    "She must have gone  somewhere else.",
    "In fact she has\ndisappeared It sounds too much of a melodramatic statement but it does amount to that.",
    "I expect\ntheres a perfectly natural explanation butwell I suppose any father would be worried.",
    "She hasnt rung\nup you see or given any explanation to the girls with whom she shares her flat.",
    "They too are worried\nNo I should not say so.",
    "I think  well I think they take such things easily enough.",
    "Girls are very independent.",
    "More so than when I left England fifteen years ago.",
    "What about the young\nman of whom you say you do not approve Can she have gone away with him I devoutly hope not.",
    "Its possible but I dont  my wife doesnt think so.",
    "You saw him I believe the day you came to our\nhouse to call on my uncle   Ah yes I think I know the young man of whom you speak.",
    "A very\nhandsome young man but not if I may say so a man of whom a father would approve.",
    "I noticed that\nyour wife was not pleased either.",
    "My wife is quite certain that he came to the house that day hoping to\nescape observation.",
    "He knows perhaps that he is not welcome there He knows all right said\nRestarick grimly.",
    "Do you not then think that it is only too likely your daughter may have joined him I dont know what\nto think.",
    "I didnt \u2014 at first.",
    "You have been to the police.",
    "No.",
    "In the case of anyone who is missing\nit is usually much better to go to the police.",
    "They too are discreet and they have many means at their disposal which persons like myself have not.",
    "I\ndont want to go to the police.",
    "Its my daughter.",
    "man you understand My daughter.",
    "If shes chosen to\n\u2014 to go away for a short time and not let us know well thats up to her.",
    "Theres no reason to believe\nthat shes in any danger or anything like that.",
    "I \u2014 I just want to know for my own satisfaction where she\nis.",
    "Is it possible Mr. Restarick \u2014 I hope I am not unduly presuming that that is not the only thing that\nis worrying you about your daughter Why should you think there was anything else Because the\nmere fact that a girl is absent for a few days without telling her parents or the friends with whom she is\nliving where she is going is not particularly unusual nowadays.",
    "It is that taken in conjunction with\nsomething else I think which has caused you this alarm.",
    "Well perhaps youre right.",
    "Its  he looked\ndoubtfully at Poirot.",
    "It is very hard to speak of these things to strangers.",
    "Not really said Poirot.",
    "It is\ninfinitely easier to speak to strangers of such things than it would be to speak of them to friends or\nacquaintances.",
    "Surely you must agree to that Perhaps.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "I can see what you mean.",
    "Well I will\nadmit I am upset about my girl.",
    "You see she  shes not quite like other girls and theres been something\n\n\falready that has definitely worried me worried us both.",
    "Poirot said Your daughter perhaps is at that\ndifficult age of young girlhood an emotional adolescence when quite frankly they are capable of\nperforming actions for which they are hardly to be held responsible.",
    "Do not take it amiss if I venture to\nmake a surmise.",
    "Your daughter perhaps resents having a stepmother That is unfortunately true.",
    "And\nyet she has no reason to do so M. Poirot.",
    "It is not as though my first wife and I had recently parted.",
    "The\nparting took place many years ago.",
    "He paused and then said I might as well speak frankly to you.",
    "After all there has been no concealment about the matter.",
    "My first wife and I drifted apart.",
    "I need not mince matters.",
    "I had met someone else someone with whom\nI was quite infatuated.",
    "I left England and went to South Africa with the other woman.",
    "My wife did not approve of divorce and I\ndid not ask her for one.",
    "I made suitable financial provision for my wife and for the child \u2014 she was only\nfive years old at the time \u2014  He paused and then went on Looking back I can see that I had been\ndissatisfied with life for some time.",
    "Id been yearning to travel.",
    "At that period of my life I hated being tied\ndown to an office desk.",
    "My brother reproached me several times with not taking more interest in the\nfamily business now that I had come in with him.",
    "He said that I was not pulling my weight.",
    "But I didnt\nwant that sort of life.",
    "I was restless.",
    "I wanted an adventurous life.",
    "I wanted to see the world and wild places...",
    "He broke off\nabruptly.",
    "Anyway \u2014 you dont want to hear the story of my life.",
    "I went to South Africa and Louise went with me.",
    "It wasnt a success.",
    "Ill admit that straight away.",
    "I was in love with her but we quarrelled incessantly.",
    "She hated life in South\nAfrica.",
    "She wanted to get back to London and Paris \u2014 all the sophisticated places.",
    "We parted only\nabout a year after we arrived there.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Perhaps I ought to have gone back then back to the tame life that I disliked the idea of so much.",
    "But I\ndidnt.",
    "I dont know whether my wife would have had me back or not.",
    "Probably she would have\nconsidered it her duty to do so.",
    "She was a great woman for doing her duty.",
    "Poirot noted the slight\nbitterness that ran through that sentence.",
    "But I ought to have thought more about Norma I suppose.",
    "Well there it was.",
    "The child was safely with her mother.",
    "Financial arrangements had been made.",
    "I wrote to her occasionally and sent her presents but I never\nonce thought of going back to England and seeing her.",
    "That was not entirely blameworthy on my part.",
    "I\nhad adopted a different way of life and I thought it would be merely unsettling for the child to have a\nfather who came and went and perhaps disturbed her own peace of mind.",
    "Anyway lets say I thought I\nwas acting for the best.",
    "Restaricks words came fast now.",
    "It was as though he was feeling a definite\nsolace in being able to pour out his story to a sympathetic listener.",
    "It was a reaction that Poirot had often\nnoticed before and he encouraged it.",
    "You never wished to come home on your own account Restarick shook his head very definitely.",
    "No.",
    "You see I was living the kind of life I liked the kind of life I was meant for.",
    "I went from South\nAfrica to East Africa.",
    "I was doing very well financially everything I touched seemed to prosper projects\nwith which I was associated occasionally with other people sometimes on my own all went well.",
    "I used\n\n\fto go off into the bush and trek.",
    "That was the life Id always wanted.",
    "I am by nature an outofdoor man.",
    "Perhaps thats why when I was married to my first wife I felt trapped held down.",
    "No I enjoyed my\nfreedom and Id no wish to go back to the conventional type of life that Id led here.",
    "But you did come\nback in the end Restarick sighed.",
    "Yes.",
    "I did come back.",
    "Ah well one grows old I suppose.",
    "Also another man and I had made a very good strike.",
    "Wed secured a concession which might have very\nimportant consequences.",
    "It would need negotiation in London.",
    "There I could have depended on my\nbrother to act but my brother died.",
    "I was still a partner in the firm.",
    "I could return if I chose and see to things myself.",
    "It was the first time I had thought of doing so.",
    "Of returning I mean to City life.",
    "Perhaps your wife your second wife   Yes you may have something there.",
    "I had been married to Mary just a month or\ntwo when my brother died.",
    "Mary was born in South Africa but she had been to England several times\nand she liked the life there.",
    "She liked particularly the idea of having an English garden\nAnd I Well for the first time perhaps I felt I would like life in England too.",
    "And I thought of Norma as\nwell.",
    "Her mother had died two years earlier.",
    "I talked to Mary about it all and she was quite willing to\nhelp me make a home for my daughter.",
    "The prospects all seemed good and so \u2014  he smiled  \u2014 and so I came home.",
    "Poirot looked at the\nportrait that hung behind Restaricks head.",
    "It was in a better light here than it had been at the house in the\ncountry.",
    "It showed very plainly the man who was sitting at the desk there were the distinctive features\nthe obstinacy of the chin the quizzical eyebrows the poise of the head but the portrait had one thing that\nthe man sitting in the chair beneath it lacked.",
    "Youth\nAnother thought occurred to Poirot.",
    "Why had Andrew Restarick moved the portrait from the country to his London office The two portraits\nof him and his wife had been companion portraits done at the same time and by that particular\nfashionable artist of the day whose speciality was portrait painting.",
    "It would have been more natural\nPoirot thought to have left them together as they had been meant to be originally.",
    "But Restarick had\nmoved one portrait his own to his office.",
    "Was it a kind of vanity on his part\u2014a wish to display himself\nas a City man as someone important to the City Yet he was a man who had spent his time in wild\nplaces who professed to prefer wild places.",
    "Or did he perhaps do it in order to keep before his mind\nhimself in his City personality.",
    "Did he feel the need of reinforcement.",
    "Or of course thought Poirot it could be simple vanity Even I myself said Poirot to himself in an\nunusual fit of modesty even I myself am capable of vanity on occasions.",
    "The short silence of which\nboth men had seemed unaware was broken.",
    "Restarick spoke apologetically.",
    "You must forgive me M. Poirot.",
    "I seem to have been boring you with the story of my life.",
    "There is\nnothing to excuse Mr. Restarick.",
    "You have been talking really only of your life as it may have affected that of your daughter.",
    "You are much\ndisquieted about your daughter.",
    "But I do not think that you have yet told me the real reason.",
    "You want her found you say Yes I want her found.",
    "You want her found yes but do you want her\nfound by me Ah do not hesitate.",
    "La politesse  it is very necessary in life but it is not necessary here.",
    "Listen.",
    "I tell you if you want your daughter found I advise you I  Hercule Poirot  to go to the police\n\n\ffor they have the facilities.",
    "And from my own knowledge they can be discreet.",
    "I wont go to the police\nunless  well unless I get very desperate.",
    "You would rather go to a private agent Yes.",
    "But you see\nI dont know anything about private agents.",
    "I dont know who  who can be trusted.",
    "I dont know who\n  And what do you know about me I do know something about you.",
    "I know for instance that you\nheld a responsible position in Intelligence during the war since in fact my own uncle vouches for you.",
    "That is an admitted fact.",
    "The faintly cynical expression on Poirots face was not perceived by Restarick.",
    "The admitted fact was as Poirot was well aware a complete illusion  although Restarick must have\nknown how undependable Sir Roderick was in the matter of memory and eyesight  he had swallowed\nPoirots own account of himself hook line and sinker.",
    "Poirot did not disillusion him.",
    "It merely confirmed\nhim in his longheld belief that you should never believe anything anyone said without first checking it.",
    "Suspect everybody had been for many years if not his whole life one of his first axioms.",
    "Let me reassure you said Poirot.",
    "I have been throughout my career exceptionally successful.",
    "I have\nbeen indeed in many ways unequalled.",
    "Restarick looked less reassured by this than he might have been\nIndeed to an Englishman a man who praised himself in such terms aroused some misgivings.",
    "He said What do you feel yourself M. Poirot Have you confidence that you can find my daughter\nProbably not as quickly as the police could do but yes.",
    "I shall find her.",
    "And  and if you do   But\nif you wish me to find her Mr.\nRestarick you must tell me all the circumstances.",
    "But I have told them to you.",
    "The time the place where she ought to be.",
    "I can give you a list of her\nfriends... Poirot was making some violent shakings of his head.",
    "No no I suggest you tell me the truth.",
    "Do you suggest I havent told you the truth You have not told me all of it.",
    "Of that I am assured.",
    "What\nare you afraid of What are the unknown facts \u2014 the facts that I have to know if I am to have success.",
    "Your daughter dislikes her stepmother.",
    "That is plain.",
    "There is nothing strange about that.",
    "It is a very natural reaction.",
    "You must remember that she may have secretly idealised you for many many\nyears.",
    "That is quite possible in the case of a broken marriage where a child has had a severe blow in her\naffections.",
    "Yes yes I know what I am talking about.",
    "You say a child forgets.",
    "That is true.",
    "Your daughter\ncould have forgotten you in the sense that when she saw you again she might not remember your face or\nyour voice.",
    "She would make her own image of you.",
    "You went away.",
    "She wanted you to come back.",
    "Her mother no doubt discouraged her from talking about you and\ntherefore she thought about you perhaps all the more.",
    "You mattered to her all the more.",
    "And because she\ncould not talk about you to her own mother she had what is a very natural reaction with a child \u2014 the\nblaming of the parent who remains for the absence of the parent who has gone.",
    "She said to herself\nsomething in the nature of Father was fond of me.",
    "Its Mother he didnt like and from that was born a\nkind of idealisation a kind of secret liaison between you and her.",
    "What had happened was not her\nfathers fault.",
    "She will not believe it\nOh yes that often happens I assure you.",
    "I know something of the psychology.",
    "So when she learns that you are coming home that you and she will be reunited many memories that she\nhas pushed aside and not thought of for years return.",
    "Her father is coming back He and she will be\nhappy together She hardly realises the stepmother perhaps until she sees her.",
    "And then she is violently jealous.",
    "It is most natural I assure you.",
    "She is violently jealous partly because\nyour wife is a goodlooking woman sophisticated and well poised which is a thing girls often resent\n\n\fbecause they frequently lack confidence in themselves.",
    "She herself is possibly gauche with perhaps an\ninferiority complex.",
    "So when she sees her competent and goodlooking stepmother quite possibly she\nhates her but hates her as an adolescent girl who is still half a child might do.",
    "Well \u2014  Restarick\nhesitated.",
    "That is more or less what the doctor said when we consulted him \u2014 I mean \u2014  Aha said\nPoirot so you consulted a doctor You must have had some reason is it not so for calling in a doctor\nNothing really.",
    "Ah no you cannot say that to Hercule Poirot.",
    "It is not nothing.",
    "It was something serious\nand you had better tell me because if I know just what has been in this girFs mind I shall make more\nprogress.",
    "Things will go quicker.",
    "Restarick was silent for several moments then he made up his mind.",
    "This is in absolute confidence M.\nPoirot I can rely on you \u2014 I have your assurance as to that By all means.",
    "What was the trouble I\ncannot be \u2014 be sure.",
    "Your daughter entered into some action against your wife Something more than\nbeing merely childishly rude or saying unpleasant things.",
    "It was something worse than that\u2014something\nmore serious.",
    "Did she perhaps attack her physically No it was not an attack \u2014 not a physical attack\nbut \u2014 nothing was proved.",
    "No no.",
    "We will admit that.",
    "My wife became far from well \u2014  He\nhesitated.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "Yes I see... And what was the nature of her illness\nDigestive possibly A form of enteritis Youre quick M. Poirot.",
    "Youre very quick.",
    "Yes it was\ndigestive.",
    "This complaint of my wifes was puzzling because she had always had excellent health.",
    "Finally\nthey sent her to hospital for observation as they call it.",
    "A check up.",
    "And the result I dont think they\nwere completely satisfied... She appeared to regain her health completely and was sent home in due\ncourse.",
    "But the trouble recurred.",
    "We went carefully over the meals she had the cooking.",
    "She seemed to\nbe suffering from a form of intestinal poisoning for which there appeared to be no cause.",
    "A further step\nwas taken tests were made of the dishes she ate.",
    "By taking samples of everything it was definitely\nproved that a certain substance had been administered in various dishes.",
    "In each case it was a dish of\nwhich only my wife had partaken.",
    "In plain language somebody was giving her arsenic.",
    "Is that right\nQuite right.",
    "In small doses which would in the end have a cumulative effect.",
    "You suspected your\ndaughter No.59 I think you did.",
    "Who else could have done it You suspected your daughter.",
    "Restarick gave a deep sigh.",
    "Frankly yes.",
    "II When Poirot arrived home George was awaiting him A woman named Edith rang up\nsir   Edith Poirot frowned.",
    "She is I gather in the service of Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "She asked me to inform you that Mrs. Oliver is in St. Giles5 Hospital.",
    "What has happened to\nher I understand she has been  er  coshed.",
    "George did not add the latter part of the message and\nyou tell him its been all his fault.",
    "Poirot clicked his tongue.",
    "I warned her \u2014 I was uneasy last night\nwhen I rang her up and there was no answer.",
    "Les Femmes.",
    "CHAPTER TWELVE\nLETS buy a peacock said Mrs. Oliver suddenly and unexpectedly.",
    "She did not open her eyes as she\nmade this remark and her voice was weak though full of indignation.",
    "Three people brought startled eyes to bear upon her.",
    "She made a further statement.",
    "Hit on the head.",
    "She opened badly focused eyes and endeavoured to make out where she was.",
    "The first thing she saw was a face entirely strange to her.",
    "A young man who was writing in a notebook.",

    "Madam I said you were a policeman said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Am I right Yes Madam.",
    "Criminal assault said Mrs. Oliver and closed her eyes in a\nsatisfied manner.",
    "When she opened them again she took in her surroundings more fully.",
    "She was in a\nbed one of those rather high hygienic looking beds she decided.",
    "The kind that you shoot up and down\nand round and about.",
    "She was not in her own home.",
    "She looked round and decided on her environment.",
    "Hospital or could be nursing home she said.",
    "A sister was standing with an air of authority at the door and a nurse was standing by her bed.",
    "She\nidentified a fourth figure.",
    "Nobody said Mrs. Oliver could mistake those moustaches.",
    "What are you\ndoing here M. Poirot Hercule Poirot advanced towards the bed.",
    "I told you to be careful Madame\nhe said.",
    "Anyone might lose their way said Mrs. Oliver somewhat obscurely and added my head aches.",
    "With good cause.",
    "As you surmise you were hit on the head.",
    "Yes.",
    "By the Peacock.",
    "The policeman\nstirred uneasily then said Excuse me.",
    "Madam you say you were assaulted by a peacock Of course.",
    "Id had an uneasy feeling for some time \u2014 you know atmosphere.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver tried to wave her hand in an appropriate gesture to describe atmosphere and winced.",
    "Ouch she\nsaid Id better not try that again.",
    "My patient must not get overexcited said the sister with disapproval.",
    "Can you tell me where this assault occurred I havent the faintest idea.",
    "Id lost my way.",
    "I was coming\nfrom a kind of studio.",
    "Very badly kept.",
    "Dirty.",
    "The other young man hadnt shaved for days.",
    "A greasy leather jacket.",
    "Is this\nthe man who assaulted you No its another one.",
    "If you could just tell me   I am telling you arent\nI Id followed him you see all the way from the cafe  only Im not very good at following people.",
    "No practice.",
    "Its much more difficult than youd think.",
    "Her eyes focused on the policeman.",
    "But I\nsuppose you know all about that.",
    "You have courses  in following people I mean Oh never mind it\ndoesnt matter.",
    "You see she said speaking with sudden rapidity its quite simple.",
    "I had got off at The Worlds End I\nthink it was and naturally I thought he had stayed with the others \u2014 or gone the other way.",
    "But instead\nhe came up behind me.",
    "Who was this The Peacock said Mrs. Oliver and he startled me you see.",
    "It does startle you when you find things are the wrong way round.",
    "I mean he was following you instead of\nyou following him\u2014only it was earlier \u2014 and I had a sort of uneasy feeling.",
    "In fact you know I was\nafraid.",
    "I dont know why.",
    "He spoke quite politely but I was afraid.",
    "Anyway there it was and he said\nCome up and see the studio and so I came up rather a rickety staircase.",
    "A kind of ladder staircase and\nthere was this other young man \u2014 the dirty young man \u2014 and he was painting a picture and the girl was\nacting as model.",
    "She was quite clean.",
    "Rather pretty really.",
    "And so there we were and they were quite nice and polite and then I said I must be\ngetting home and they told me the right way to get back to the Kings Road.",
    "But they cant really have\n\n\ftold me the right way.",
    "Of course I might have made a mistake.",
    "You know when people tell you second\nleft and third right well you sometimes do it the wrong way round.",
    "At least I do.",
    "Anyway I got into a\nrather peculiar slummy part quite close to the river.",
    "The afraid feeling had gone away by then.",
    "I must have\nbeen quite off my guard when the Peacock hit me.",
    "I think shes delirious59 said the nurse in an\nexplanatory voice.",
    "No Im not said Mrs. Oliver.",

    "How silly.",
    "What would a real peacock be\ndoing down on Chelsea Embankment.",
    "Nobody appeared to have an answer to this question.",
    "He struts said Mrs. Oliver thats why I nicknamed him a peacock.",
    "Shows off you know.",
    "Vain I\nshould think.",
    "Proud of his looks.",
    "Perhaps a lot of other things as well.",
    "She looked at Poirot.",
    "David\nsomething.",
    "You know who I mean.",
    "You say this young man of the name of David assaulted you by striking you on\nthe head Yes I do.",
    "Hercule Poirot spoke.",
    "You saw him I didnt see him said Mrs. Oliver I\ndidnt know anything about it.",
    "I just thought I heard something behind me and before I could turn my\nhead to look \u2014 it all happened Just as if a ton of bricks or something fell on me.",
    "I think Ill go to sleep\nnow she added.",
    "She moved her head slightly made a grimace of pain and relapsed into what appeared to be a perfectly\nsatisfactory unconsciousness.",
    "CHAPTER THIRTEEN\nPOIROT seldom used the key to his flat.",
    "Instead in an oldfashioned manner he pressed the bell and\nwaited for that admirable factotum George to open the door.",
    "On this occasion however after his visit\nto the hospital the door was opened to him by Miss Lemon.",
    "Youve got two visitors said Miss Lemon pitching her voice in an admirable tone not as carrying as a\nwhisper but a good many notes lower than her usual pitch.",
    "Ones Mr. Goby and the other is an old\ngentleman called Sir Roderick Horsefield.",
    "I dont know which you want to see first.",
    "Sir Roderick\nHorsefield mused Poirot.",
    "He considered this with his head on one side looking rather like a robin while he decided how this latest\ndevelopment was likely to affect the general picture.",
    "Mr.\nGoby however materialised with his usual suddenness from the small room which was sacred to Miss\nLemons typewriting and where she had evidently kept him in storage.",
    "Poirot removed his overcoat.",
    "Miss Lemon hung it up on the hallstand and Mr. Goby as was his\nfashion addressed the back of Miss Lemons head.",
    "Ill have a cup of tea in the kitchen with George said Mr. Goby.",
    "My time is my own.",
    "Ill keep.",
    "He\n\n\fdisappeared obligingly into the kitchen.",
    "Poirot went into his sittingroom where Sir Roderick was pacing up and down full of vitality.",
    "Run you down my boy he said genially.",
    "Wonderful thing the telephone.",
    "You remembered my name\nI am gratified.",
    "Well I didnt exactly remember your name said Sir Roderick.",
    "Names you know have\nnever been my strong point.",
    "Never forget a face he ended proudly.",
    "No.",
    "I rang up Scotland Yard.",
    "Oh Poirot looked faintly startled though reflecting that that was the\nsort of thing that Sir Roderick would do.",
    "Asked me who I wanted to speak to.",
    "I said put me on to the top.",
    "Thats the thing to do in life my boy.",
    "Never accept second in charge.",
    "No good.",
    "Go to the top thats what I say.",
    "I said who I was mind you.",
    "Said I wanted to speak to the top brass and I got on to it in the end.",
    "Very civil fellow.",
    "Told him I wanted the address of a chap in Allied Intelligence who was out with me at a certain place in\nFrance at a certain date.",
    "The chap seemed a bit at sea so I said You know who I mean.",
    "A Frenchman I said or a Belgian.",
    "Belgian werent you I said Hes got a Christian name something like Achilles.",
    "Its not Achilles I said\nbut its like Achilles.",
    "Little chap I said big moustaches.",
    "And then he seemed to catch on and he said\nyoud be in the telephone book he thought.",
    "I said thats all right but I said He wont be listed under\nAchilles or Hercules as he said it was will he and I cant remember his second name.",
    "So then he gave\nit me.",
    "Very civil sort of fellow.",
    "Very civil I must say.",
    "I am delighted to see you said Poirot sparing a hurried thought for what might\nbe said to him later by Sir Rodericks telephone acquaintance.",
    "Fortunately it was not likely to have been\nquite the top brass.",
    "It was presumably someone with whom he was already acquainted and whose job it was to produce\ncivility on tap for distinguished persons of a bygone day.",
    "Anyway said Sir Roderick I got here.",
    "I am delighted.",
    "Let me offer you some refreshment.",
    "Tea a\ngrenadine a whisky and soda some strop de cassis   Good lord no said Sir Roderick alarmed at\nthe mention ofsirop de cassis.",
    "Ill take whisky for choice.",
    "Not that Im allowed it he added but\ndoctors are all fools as we know.",
    "All they care for is stopping you having anything youve a fancy for.",
    "Poirot rang for George and gave him the proper instructions.",
    "The whisky and the siphon were placed at\nSir Rodericks elbow and George withdrew.",
    "Now said Poirot what can I do for you Got a job for you old boy.",
    "After the lapse of time he\nseemed even more convinced of the close liaison between him and Poirot in the past which was as well\nthought Poirot since it would produce an even greater dependence on his Poirots capabilities by Sir\nRodericks nephew.",
    "Papers said Sir Roderick dropping his voice.",
    "Lost some papers and Ive got to find em see So I\nthought what with my eyes not being as good as they were and the memory being a trifle off key\nsometimes Id better go to someone in the know.",
    "See You came along in the nick of time the other day just in time to be useful because Pve got to\ncough em up you understand.",
    "It sounds most interesting said Poirot.",
    "What are these papers if I may ask Well I suppose if youre going to find them youll have to ask\nwont you Mind you theyre very secret and confidential.",
    "Top secret \u2014 or they were once.",
    "And it seems as though they are going to be again.",
    "An interchange of letters it was.",
    "Not of any particular importance at the time \u2014 or it was thought they\nwere of no importance but then of course politics change.",
    "You know the way it is.",
    "They go round and\nface the other way.",
    "You know how it was when the war broke out.",
    "None of us knew whether we were\non our head or on our heels.",
    "One war were pals with the Italians next war were enemies.",
    "I dont know\nwhich of them all was the worst.",
    "First war the Japanese were our dear allies and the next war there they\nare blowing up Pearl Harbour Never knew where you were\nStart one way with the Russians and finish the opposite way.",
    "I tell you Poirot nothings more difficult\nnowadays than the question of allies.",
    "They can change overnight.",
    "And you have lost some papers said Poirot recalling the old man to the subject of his visit.",
    "Yes.",
    "Ive got a lot of papers you know and Ive dug em out lately.",
    "I had em put away safely.",
    "In a\nbank as a matter of fact but I got em all out and I began sorting through them because I thought why\nnot write my memoirs.",
    "All the chaps are doing it nowadays.",
    "Weve had Montgomery and Alanbrooke\nand Auchinleck all shooting their mouths off in print mostly saying what they thought of the other\ngenerals.",
    "Weve even had old Moran a respectable physician blabbing about his important patient.",
    "Dont know what things will come to next Anyway there it is and I thought Id be quite interested\nmyself in telling a few facts about some people I knew Why shouldnt I have a go as well as everyone\nelse I was in it all.",
    "I am sure it could be a matter of much interest to people said Poirot.",
    "Ahha yes One knew a lot of people in the news.",
    "Everyone looked at them with awe.",
    "They didnt\nknow they were complete fools but I knew.",
    "My goodness the mistakes some of those brasshats made\n\u2014 youd be surprised.",
    "So I got out my papers and I had the little girl help me sort em out.",
    "Nice little\ngirl that and quite bright.",
    "Doesnt know English very well but apart from that shes very bright and helpful.",
    "Id salted away a lot of stuff but everything was in a bit of a muddle.",
    "The point of the whole thing is the\npapers I wanted werent there.",
    "Werent there No.",
    "We thought wed given it a miss by mistake to\nbegin with but we went over it again and I can tell you Poirot a lot of stuff seemed to me to have been\npinched.",
    "Some of it wasnt important.",
    "Actually the stuff I was looking for wasnt particularly important \u2014 I mean\nnobody had thought it was otherwise I suppose I shouldnt have been allowed to keep it.",
    "But anyway\nthese particular letters werent there.",
    "I wish of course to be discreet said Poirot but can you tell me\nat all the nature of these letters you refer to Dont know that I can old boy.",
    "The nearest I can go is of\nsomebody whos shooting off his mouth nowadays about what he did and what he said in the past.",
    "But hes not speaking the truth and these letters just show exactly how much of a liar he is Mind you I\ndont suppose theyd be published now.",
    "Well just send him nice copies of them and tell him this is\nexactly what he did say at the time and that weve got it in writing.",
    "I shouldnt be surprised ifwell things\nwent a bit differently after that.",
    "See I hardly need ask that need I Youre familiar with all that kind\n\n\foftalkytalky.",
    "Youre quite right.",
    "Sir Roderick.",
    "I know exactly the kind of thing you mean but you see\nalso that it is not easy to help you recover something if one does not know what that something is and\nwhere it is likely to be now.",
    "First things first I want to know who pinched em because you see thats\nthe important point.",
    "There may be more top secret stuff in my little collection and I want to know whos\ntampering with it.",
    "Have you any ideas yourself You think I ought to have hell\nWell it would seem that the principal possibility \u2014  I know.",
    "You want me to say its the little girl.",
    "Well I dont think it is the little girl.",
    "She says she didnt and I believe her.",
    "Understand Yes said Poirot with a slight sigh I understand.",
    "For one thing shes too young.",
    "She\nwouldnt know these things were important.",
    "Its before her time.",
    "Someone else might have instructed her as to that.",
    "Poirot pointed out.",
    "Yes yes thats true enough.",
    "But its too obvious as well.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "He doubted if it was any use\ninsisting in view of Sir Rodericks obvious partiality.",
    "Who else had access Andrew and Mary of\ncourse but I doubt if Andrew would even be interested in such things.",
    "Anyway hes always been a very\ndecent boy.",
    "Always was.",
    "Not that Ive ever known him very well.",
    "Used to come for the holidays once or\ntwice with his brother and thats about all.",
    "Of course he ditched his wife and went off with an attractive\nbit of goods to South Africa but that might happen to any man especially with a wife like Grace.",
    "Not\nthat I ever saw much of her either.",
    "Kind of woman who looked down her nose and was full of good\nworks.",
    "Anyway you cant imagine a chap like Andrew being a spy.",
    "As for Mary she seems all right.",
    "Never looks at anything but a rose bush as far as I can make out.",
    "Theres a gardener but hes eightythree and has lived in the village all his life and there are a couple of\nwomen always dodging about the house making a noise with Hoovers but I cant see them in the role of\nspies either.",
    "So you see its got to be an outsider.",
    "Of course Mary wears a wig went on Sir Roderick\nrather inconsequently.",
    "I mean it might make you think she was a spy because she wore a wig but thats not the case.",
    "She lost\nher hair in a fever when she was eighteen.",
    "Pretty bad luck for a young woman.",
    "Id no idea she wore a\nwig to begin with but a rose bush caught in her hair one day and whisked it sideways.",
    "Yes very bad\nluck.",
    "I thought there was something a little odd about the way she had arranged her hair said Poirot.",
    "Anyway the best secret agents never wear wigs Sir Roderick informed him.",
    "Poor devils have to go to plastic surgeons and get their faces altered.",
    "But someones been mucking\nabout with my private papers.",
    "You dont think that you may perhaps have placed them in some different\ncontainer  in a drawer or a different file.",
    "When did you see them last I handled these things about a year ago.",
    "I remember I thought then theyd\nmake rather good copy and I noted those particular letters.",
    "Now theyre gone.",
    "Somebodys taken\nthem.",
    "You do not suspect your nephew Andrew his wife or the domestic staff.",
    "What about the daughter Norma Well Normas a bit off her onion Id say.",
    "I mean she might be one\nof those kleptomaniacs who take peoples things without knowing theyre taking them but I dont see her\nfumbling about among my papers.",
    "Then what do you think Well youve been in the house.",
    "You saw\nwhat the house is like.",
    "Anyone can walk in and out any time they like.",
    "We dont lock our doors.",
    "We never have.",
    "Do you lock the door of your own room\u2014if you go up to\nLondon for instance I never thought of it as necessary.",
    "I do now of course but whats the use of that\n\n\fToo late.",
    "Anyway Ive only an ordinary key fits any of the doors.",
    "Someone must have come in from\noutside.",
    "Why nowadays thats how all the burglaries take place.",
    "People walk in in the middle of the day stump up the stairs go into any room they like rifle the jewel\nbox go out again and nobody sees them or cares who they are.",
    "They probably look like mods or rockers or beatniks or whatever they call these chaps nowadays with\nthe long hair and the dirty nails.",
    "Ive seen more than one of them prowling about.",
    "One doesnt like to say\nWho the devil are you You never know which sex they are which is embarrassing.",
    "The place crawls with them.",
    "I suppose theyre Normas friends.",
    "Wouldnt have been allowed in in the old\ndays.",
    "But you turn them out of the house and then you find out its Viscount Endersleigh or Lady\nCharlotte Marjoribanks.",
    "Dont know where you are nowadays He paused.",
    "If anyone can get to the\nbottom of it you can Poirot.",
    "He swallowed the last mouthful of whisky and got up.",
    "Well thats that.",
    "Its up to you.",
    "Youll take it on wont you I will do my best said Poirot.",
    "The frontdoor bell rang.",
    "Thats the little girl said Sir Roderick.",
    "Punctual to the minute.",
    "Wonderful isnt it Couldnt go about London without her you know.",
    "Blind as a\nbat.",
    "Cant see to cross the road.",
    "Can you not have glasses Ive got some somewhere but theyre\nalways falling off my nose or else I lose them.",
    "Besides I dont like glasses.",
    "Ive never had glasses.",
    "When\nI was sixtyfive I could see to read without glasses and thats pretty good.",
    "Nothing said Hercule\nPoirot lasts for ever.",
    "George ushered in Sonia.",
    "She was looking extremely pretty.",
    "Her slightly shy\nmanner became her very well Poirot thought.",
    "He moved forward with Gallic empressement.",
    "Enchante Mademoiselle he said bowing over her hand.",
    "Im not late am I Sir Roderick she said looking past him.",
    "I have not kept you waiting.",
    "Please I hope\nnot.",
    "Exact to the minute little girl said Sir Roderick.",
    "All shipshape and Bristol fashion he added.",
    "Sonia looked slightly perplexed.",
    "Made a good tea I hope Sir Roderick went on.",
    "I told you you know to have a good tea buy\nyourself some buns or eclairs or whatever it is young ladies like nowadays eh You obeyed orders I\nhope.",
    "No not exactly.",
    "I took the time to buy a pair of shoes.",
    "Look they are pretty are they not She\nstuck out a foot.",
    "It was certainly a very pretty foot.",
    "Sir Roderick beamed at it.",
    "Well we must go and catch our train he said.",
    "I may be oldfashioned but Im all for trains.",
    "Start to\ntime and get there on time or they should do.",
    "But these cars they get in a queue in the rush hour and you\nmay idle the time away for about an hour and a half more than you need.",
    "Cars\nPah Shall I ask George to get you a taxi asked Hercule Poirot.",
    "It will be no trouble I assure you.",
    "I\nhave a taxi already waiting said Sonia.",
    "There you are said Sir Roderick you see she thinks of everything.",
    "He patted her on the shoulder.",
    "She looked at him in a way that Hercule Poirot fully appreciated.",
    "Poirot accompanied them to the hall door and took a polite leave of them.",
    "Mr.\nGoby had come out of the kitchen and was standing in the hall giving it could be said an excellent\nperformance of a man who had come to see about the gas.",
    "George shut the hall door as soon as they had disappeared into the lift and turned to meet Poirots gaze.",
    "And what is your opinion of that young lady Georges may I ask said Poirot.",
    "It was sometimes his habit to seek information from George.",
    "On certain points he always said George\nwas infallible.",
    "Well sir said George if I might put it that way if youll allow me I would say hed got it badly sir.",
    "All\nover her as you might say.",
    "I think you are right said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Its not unusual of course with gentlemen of that age.",
    "I remember Lord Mountbryan.",
    "Hed had a lot of experience in his life and youd say he was as fly as anyone.",
    "But youd be surprised.",
    "A young woman came to give him a massage.",
    "Youd be surprised at what he\ngave her.",
    "An evening frock and a pretty bracelet.",
    "Forgetmenots it was.",
    "Turquoise and diamonds.",
    "Not too expensive but costing quite a pretty penny all the same.",
    "Then a fur wrap  not mink Russian\nermine and a petty point evening bag.",
    "After that her brother got into trouble debt or something though\nwhether she ever had a brother I sometimes wondered.",
    "Lord Mountbryan gave her the money to square it  she was so upset about it All platonic mind you\ntoo.",
    "Gentlemen seem to lose their sense that way when they get to that age.",
    "Its the clinging ones they go for\nnot the bold type.3 I have no doubt that you are quite right Georges said Poirot.",
    "It is all the same not\na complete answer to my question.",
    "I asked what you thought of the young lady.",
    "Oh the young lady... Well sir I wouldnt like to say\ndefinitely but shes quite a definite type.",
    "Theres never anything that you could put your finger on.",
    "But they know what theyre doing Id say.",

    "Enfiny he said it is too much There is far too much.",
    "Now we have espionage and counter espionage.",
    "All I am seeking is one perfectly simple murder.",
    "I begin to suspect that that murder only occurred in a\ndrug addicts brain\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\nMadame Poirot bowed and presented Mrs. Oliver with a bouquet very stylised a posy in the\nVictorian manner.",
    "M. Poirot Well really that is very nice of you and its very like you somehow.",
    "All my flowers are always so untidy.",
    "She looked towards a vase of rather temperamental looking\nchrysanthemums then back to the prim circle of rosebuds.",
    "And how nice of you to come and see me.",
    "I come Madame to offer you my felicitations on your recovery.",
    "Yes said Mrs. Oliver I suppose I\nam all right again.",
    "She shook her head to and fro rather gingerly.",
    "I get headaches though she said.",
    "Quite bad headaches.",
    "You remember Madame that I warned you not to do anything dangerous.",
    "Not to stick my neck out in fact.",
    "That I suppose is just what I did do.",
    "She added c felt something evil\nwas about.",
    "I was frightened too and I told myself I was a fool to be frightened because what was I\nfrightened of I mean it was London.",
    "Right in the middle of London.",
    "People all about.",
    "I mean \u2014 how could I be frightened.",
    "It wasnt like a lonely wood or anything.",
    "Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "He wondered had Mrs.\nOliver really felt this nervous fear had she really suspected the presence of evil the sinister feeling that\nsomething or someone wished her ill or had she read it into the whole thing afterwards\n\n\fHe knew only too well how easily that could be done.",
    "Countless clients had spoken in much the same\nwords that Mrs. Oliver had just used.",
    "I knew something was wrong.",
    "I could feel evil.",
    "I knew something was going to happen and actually they had not felt anything.",
    "Was\nMrs. Oliver of the same\nHe looked at her consideringly.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver in her own opinion was famous for her intuition.",
    "One intuition succeeded another with remarkable\nrapidity and Mrs.\nOliver always claimed the right to justify the particular intuition which turned out to be right\nAnd yet one shared very often with animals the uneasiness of a dog or a cat before a thunderstorm the\nknowledge that there is something wrong although one does not know what it is that is wrong.",
    "When did it come upon you this fear When I left the main road said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Up till then it was all ordinary and quite exciting and  yes I was enjoying myself though vexed\nat finding how difficult it was to trail anybody.",
    "She paused considering.",
    "Just like a game.",
    "Then suddenly\nit didnt seem so much like a game because they were queer little streets and rather sort of brokendown\nplaces and sheds and open spaces being cleared for building  oh I dont know I cant explain it.",
    "But\nwas all different.",
    "Like a dream really.",
    "You know how dreams are.",
    "They start with one thing a party or\nsomething and then suddenly you find youre in a jungle or somewhere quite differentand its all\nsinister.",
    "A jungle said Poirot.",
    "Yes it is interesting you should put it like that.",
    "So it felt to you as though you were in a ungle and you were afraid of a peacock I dont know that I\nwas especially afraid of him.",
    "After all a peacock isnt a dangerous sort of animal.",
    "Itswell I mean I\nthought of him as a peacock because I thought of him as a decorative creature.",
    "A peacock is very\ndecorative isnt it And this awful boy is decorative too.",
    "You didnt have any idea anyone was\nfollowing you before you were hit No.",
    "No Id no idea  but I think he directed me wrong all the\nsame.",
    "Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "But of course it must have been the Peacock who hit me said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Who else The dirty boy in the greasy clothes He smelt nasty but he wasnt sinister.",
    "And it could hardly\nbe that limp Frances something  she was draped over a packing case with long black hair streaming all\nover the place.",
    "She reminded me of some actress or other.",
    "You say she was acting as a model Yes.",
    "Not for the Peacock.",
    "For the dirty boy.",
    "I cant remember if youve seen her or not.",
    "I have not yet had\nthat pleasure  if it is a pleasure.",
    "Well shes quite nice looking in an untidy arty sort of way.",
    "Very\nmuch made up.",
    "Dead white and lots of mascara and the usual kind of limp hair hanging over her face.",
    "Works in an art gallery so I suppose its quite natural that she should be among all the beatniks acting as\na model.",
    "How these girls can I suppose she might have fallen for the Peacock.",
    "But its probably the dirty\none.",
    "All the same I dont see her coshing me on the head somehow.",
    "I had another possibility in mind\nMadame.",
    "Someone may have noticed you following Davidand in turn followed you.",
    "Someone saw\nme trailing David and then they trailed me Or someone may have been already in the mews or the\nyard keeping perhaps an eye on the same people that you were observing.",
    "Thats an idea of course\nsaid Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "I wonder who they could be Poirot gave an exasperated sigh.",
    "Ah it is there.",
    "It is difficulttoo\ndifficult.",
    "Too many people too many things.",
    "I cannot see anything clearly.",
    "I see only a girl who said that she may\nhave committed a murder That is all that I have to go on and you see even there there are difficulties.",
    "What do you mean by difficulties Reflect said Poirot.",
    "Reflection had never been Mrs. Olivers strong point.",
    "You always mix me up she complained.",
    "I am talking about a murder but what murder The murder of the stepmother I suppose.",
    "But the\nstepmother is not murdered.",
    "She is alive.",
    "You really are the most maddening man said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Poirot sat up in his chair.",
    "He brought the tips of his fingers together and prepared  or so Mrs. Oliver\nsuspected  to enjoy himself.",
    "You refuse to reflect he said.",
    "But to get anywhere we must reflect.",
    "I dont want to reflect.",
    "What I\nwant to know is what youve been doing about everything while Ive been in hospital.",
    "You must have done something.",
    "What have you done Poirot ignored this question.",
    "We must begin at the beginning.",
    "One day you rang me up.",
    "I was in distress.",
    "Yes I admit it I was in distress.",
    "Something extremely painful had been said to me.",
    "You Madame were\nkindness itself.",
    "You cheered me you encouraged me.",
    "You gave me a delicious tasse de chocolat.",
    "And what is more you not only offered to help me but you\ndid help me.",
    "You helped me to find a girl who had come to me and said that she thought she might have\ncommitted a murder Let us ask ourselves Madame what about this murder\nWho has been murdered Where have they been murdered Why have they been murdered Oh do\nstop said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Youre making my head ache again and thats bad for me.",
    "Poirot paid no\nattention to this plea.",
    "Have we got a murder at all You say  the stepmother  but I reply that the stepmother is not dead so as yet we have no murder.",
    "But there ought to have been a murder.",
    "So me I enquire first of all who is\ndead Somebody comes to me and mentions a murder.",
    "A murder that has been committed somewhere\nand somehow.",
    "But I cannot find that murder and what you are about to say once again that the attempted murder of\nMary Restarick will do very well does not satisfy Hercule Poirot.",
    "I really cant think what more you\nwant said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I want a murder said Hercule Poirot.",
    "It sounds very bloodthirsty when you say it like that I look for a murder and I cannot find a murder.",
    "It\n\n\fis exasperating  so I ask you to reflect with me.",
    "Ive got a splendid idea said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Suppose Andrew Restarick murdered his first wife before he went off in a hurry to South Africa.",
    "Had you thought of that possibility I certainly did not think of any such thing said Poirot indignantly.",
    "Well Pve thought of it said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Its very interesting.",
    "He was in love with this other woman and he wanted like Crippen to go off\nwith her and so he murdered the first one and nobody ever suspected.",
    "Poirot drew a long exasperated\nsigh.",
    "But his wife did not die until eleven or twelve years after hed left this country for South Africa and\nhis child could not have been concerned in the murder of her own mother at the age of five years old.",
    "She could have given her mother the wrong medicine or perhaps Restarick just said that she died.",
    "After\nall we dont know that shes dead.",
    "I do said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I have made enquiries.",
    "The first Mrs.\nRestarick died on the i4th April 1963.",
    "How can you know these things Because I have employed\nsomeone to check the facts.",
    "I beg of you Madame do not jump to impossible conclusions in this rash\nway.",
    "I thought I was being rather clever said Mrs. Oliver obstinately.",
    "If I was making it happen in a\nbook thats how  would arrange it.",
    "And Id make the child have done it.",
    "Not meaning to but just by her\nfather telling her to give her mother a drink made of pounded up box hedge.",
    "Nom Tun nom Tun nom\n said Poirot.",
    "All right said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You tell it your way.",
    "Alas I have nothing to tell.",
    "I look for a murder and I\ndo not find one.",
    "Not after Mary Restarick is ill and goes to hospital and gets better and comes back\nand is ill again and if they looked theyd probably find arsenic or something hidden away by Norma\nsomewhere.",
    "That is exactly what they did find.",
    "Well really M. Poirot what more do you want I\nwant you to pay some attention to the meaning of language.",
    "That girl said to me the same thing as she had\nsaid to my manservant Georges.",
    "She did not say on either occasion I have tried to kill someone.",
    "or I\nhave tried to kill my stepmother.",
    "She spoke each time of a deed that had been done something that had already happened.",
    "Definitely\nhappened.",
    "In the past \u00ab\u00ab tense.",
    "I give up said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You just wont believe that Norma tried to\nkill her stepmother.",
    "Yes I believe it is perfectly possible that Norma may have tried to kill her\nstepmother.",
    "I think it is probably what happened  it is in accord psychologically.",
    "With her distraught frame of mind.",
    "But it is not proved.",
    "Anyone remember could have hidden a\npreparation of arsenic amongst Normas things.",
    "It could even have been put there by the husband.",
    "You\nalways seem to think that husbands are the ones who kill their wives said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "A husband is usually the most likely person said Hercule Poirot so one considers him first.",
    "It could\nhave been the girl Norma or it could have been one of the servants or it could have been the au pair\ngirl or it could have been old Sir Roderick.",
    "Or it could have been Mrs.\nRestarick herself.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Why There could be reasons.",
    "Rather farfetched reasons but not\nbeyond the bounds of belief.",
    "Really Monsieur Poirot you cant suspect everybody.",
    "Mais oui that is\njust what I can do.",
    "I suspect everybody.",
    "First I suspect then I look for reasons.",
    "And what reason would that poor foreign\nchild have It might depend on what she is doing in that house and what her reasons are for coming to\nEngland and a good deal more beside.",
    "Youre really crazy.",
    "Or it could have been the boy David.",
    "Your Peacock.",
    "Much too farfetched.",
    "David wasnt there.",
    "Hes never been near the house.",
    "Oh yes he\nhas.",
    "He was wandering about its corridors the day I went there.",
    "But not putting poisonin Normas\n\n\froom.",
    "How do you know But she and that awful boy are in love with each other.",
    "They appear to\nbe so I admit.",
    "You always want to make everything difficult complained Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Things have been made difficult for me.",
    "I need information and there is only one person who\ncan give me information.",
    "And she has disappeared.",
    "You mean Norma.",
    "Yes I mean Norma.",
    "But she\nhasnt disappeared.",
    "We found her you and I.",
    "She walked out of that cafe and once more she has\ndisappeared.",
    "And you let her go Mrs. Olivers voice quivered with reproach.",
    "Alas  You let her go You didnt even try to find her again I did not say I had not tried to find her.",
    "But so far you have not succeeded.",
    "M. Poirot I really am disappointed with you.",
    "There is a pattern said Hercule Poirot almost dreamily.",
    "Yes there is a pattern.",
    "But because there is one factor missing the pattern does not make sense.",
    "You see that dont you No said Mrs. Oliver whose head was aching.",
    "Poirot continued to talk more to himself than his listener.",
    "If Mrs. Oliver could be said to be listening.",
    "She\nwas highly indignant with Poirot and she thought to herself that the Restarick girl had been quite right and\nthat Poirot was too old\nThere she herself had found the girl for him had telephoned him so that he might arrive in time had gone\noff herself to shadow the other half of the couple.",
    "She had left the girl to Poirot and what had Poirot\ndone  lost her In fact she could not really see that Poirot had done anything at all of any use at any time\nwhatever.",
    "She was disappointed in him.",
    "When he stopped talking she would tell him so again.",
    "Poirot was quietly and methodically outlining what he called the pattern.",
    "It interlocks.",
    "Yes it interlocks and that is why it is difficult.",
    "One thing relates to another and then you find\nthat it relates to something else that seems outside the pattern.",
    "But it is not outside the pattern.",
    "And so it brings more people again into a ring of suspicion.",
    "Suspicion of what\nThere again one does not know.",
    "We have first the girl and through all the maze of conflicting patterns I\nhave to search the answer to the most poignant of questions.",
    "Is the girl a victim is she in danger Or is the girl very astute.",
    "Is the girl creating the impression she wants\nto create for her own purposes It can be taken either way.",
    "I need something still.",
    "Some one sure pointer and it is there somewhere.",
    "I am sure it is there\nsomewhere.",
    "Mrs. Oliver was rummaging in her handbag.",
    "I cant think why I can never find my aspirin when I want it she said m a vexed voice.",
    "We have one set of relationships that hook up.",
    "The father the daughter the stepmother.",
    "Their lives are\ninterrelated.",
    "We have the elderly uncle somewhat gaga with whom they live.",
    "We have the girl Sonia.",
    "She is linked\nwith the uncle.",
    "She works for him.",
    "She has pretty manners pretty ways.",
    "He is delighted with her.",
    "He is shall we say a little soft about her.",
    "But what is her role in the household Wants to learn English I suppose said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She meets one of the members of the Hertzogovinian Embassy \u2014 in Kew Gardens.",
    "She meets him\nthere but she does not speak to him.",
    "She leaves behind her a book and he takes it away \u2014  What is\nall this said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Has this anything to do with the other pattern We do not as yet know.",
    "It seems unlikely but it may not\nbe unlikely.",
    "Had Mary Restarick unwittingly stumbled upon something which might be dangerous to the\ngirl Dont tell me all this has something to do with espionage or something.",
    "I am not telling you.",
    "I am\nwondering.",
    "You said yourself that old Sir Roderick was gaga.",
    "It is not a question of whether he is\ngaga or not.",
    "He was a person of some importance during the war.",
    "Important papers passed through his\nhands.",
    "Important letters can have been written to him.",
    "Letters which he was at perfect liberty to have kept once they had lost their importance.",
    "Youre talking\nof the war and that was ages ago.",
    "Quite so.",
    "But the past is not always done with because it is ages\nago.",
    "New alliances are made.",
    "Public speeches are made repudiating this denying that telling various lies\nabout something else.",
    "And suppose there exist still certain letters or documents that will change the\npicture of a certain personality.",
    "I am not telling you anything you understand.",
    "I am only making\nassumptions.",
    "Assumptions such as I have known to be true in the past.",
    "It might be of the utmost importance that some letters or papers should be destroyed or else passed to\nsome foreign government.",
    "Who better to undertake that task than a charming young lady who assists and aids an elderly notability\nto collect material for his Memoirs.",
    "Everyone is writing their memoirs nowadays.",
    "One cannot stop them\nfrom doing so Suppose that the stepmother gets a little something in her food on the day that the helpful\nsecretary plus au pair girl is doing the cooking And suppose it is she who arranges that suspicion should\nfall on Norma What a mind you have said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Tortuous thats what I call it.",
    "I mean all these things cant have happened.",
    "That is just it.",
    "There are too many patterns.",
    "Which is the\nright one The girl Norma leaves home goes to London.",
    "She is as you have instructed me a third girl sharing a flat with two other girls.",
    "There again you may have a pattern.",
    "The two girls are strangers to her.",
    "But then what do I learn Claudia ReeceHolland is private secretary to\nNorma Restaricks father.",
    "Here again we have a link.",
    "Is that mere chance Or could there be a pattern of\nsome kind behind it.",
    "The other girl you tell me acts as a model and is acquainted with the boy you call the Peacock with\nwhom Norma is in love.",
    "Again a link.",
    "More links.",
    "And what is Davidthe Peacockdoing in all this Is\nhe in love with Norma It would seem so.",
    "Her parents dislike it as is only probable and natural.",
    "Its odd\nabout Claudia ReeceHolland being Restaricks secretary said Mrs.\nOliver thoughtfully.",
    "I should judge she was unusually efficient at anything she undertook.",
    "Perhaps it was\nshe who pushed the woman out of the window on the seventh floor.",
    "Poirot turned slowly towards her.",
    "What are you saying he demanded.",
    "What are you saying Just someone in the flats  I dont even\nknow her name but she fell out of a window or threw herself out of a window on the seventh floor and\nkilled herself.",
    "Poirots voice rose high and stern.",
    "And you never told me he said accusingly.",
    "Mrs. Oliver stared at him in surprise.",
    "I dont know what you mean.",
    "What I mean I ask you to tell me of a death.",
    "That is what I mean.",
    "A\ndeath.",
    "And you say there are no deaths.",
    "You can think only of an attempted poisoning.",
    "And yet here is a\ndeath.",
    "A death at  what is the name of those mansions Borodene Mansions.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "And when\ndid it happen This suicide Or whatever it was I think \u2014 yes \u2014 I think it was about a week before I\nwent there.",
    "Perfect How did you hear about it A milkman told me.",
    "A milkman bon Dieu He\nwas just being chatty said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "It sounded rather sad.",
    "It was in the day time \u2014 very early in the morning I think.",
    "What was\nher name Ive no idea.",
    "I dont think he mentioned it.",
    "Young middleaged old Mrs. Oliver\nconsidered.",
    "Well he didnt say her exact age.",
    "Fiftyish I think was what he said.",
    "I wonder now.",
    "Anyone the three girls knew How can I tell Nobody has said anything about it.",
    "And you never\nthought of telling me.",
    "Well really.",
    "M. Poirot I cannot see that it has anything to do with all this.",
    "Well I suppose it may have \u2014 but nobody seems to have said so or thought of it.",
    "But yes there is the\nlink.",

    "Do you not see A death and not many days later someone who thinks she may have committed a murder.",
    "Yes this must be the\nmurder Mrs. Oliver wanted to say nonsense but she did not quite dare to do so.",
    "Nevertheless she thought it.",
    "This then must be the one piece of knowledge that had not yet come to me.",
    "This ought to tie up the whole thing\nYes yes I do not see yet how but it must be so.",
    "I must think.",
    "That is what I must do.",
    "I must go home and think until slowly the pieces fit together  because this will be the key piece that ties\nthem all together...",
    "Yes.",
    "At last.",
    "At last I shall see my way.",
    "He rose to his feet and said Adieu chere\nMadame and hurried from the room.",

    "He\nthought in a certain way peculiar to himself.",
    "It was the technique of a man who selected thoughts as one\nmight select pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.",
    "In due course they would be reassembled together so as to make\n\n\fa clear and coherent picture.",
    "At the moment the important thing was the selection the separation.",
    "He\nsipped his tisane put down the cup rested his hands on the arms of his chair and let various pieces of his\npuzzle come one by one into his mind.",

    "A woman who turned a woman bending her head cutting out the weak growth of a rose turning and\nlooking at him What was there for him there Nothing.",
    "A golden head a golden head bright as a\ncornfield with twists and loops of hair slightly reminiscent of Mrs. Olivers own in shape.",
    "He smiled a\nlittle.",
    "But Mary Restaricks hair was more tidily arranged than Mrs. Olivers ever was.",
    "A golden frame for\nher face that seemed just a little too large for her.",
    "He remembered that old Sir Roderick had said that she\nhad to wear a wig because of an illness.",
    "Sad for so young a woman.",
    "There was when he came to think\nof it something unusually heavy about her head.",
    "Far too static too perfectly arranged.",
    "He considered\nMary Restaricks wig  if it was a wig  for he was by no means sure that he could depend on Sir\nRoderick.",
    "He examined the possibilities of the wig in case they should be of significance.",
    "He reviewed the\nconversation they had had.",
    "Had they said anything important He thought not.",

    "Here\nwas a man who had come back to this country after year of absence who had no near friends or\nrelatives who was perplexed and troubled over his daughters character and conduct.",
    "It was probably\nnatural enough that he should turn to his recently acquired eminently competent secretary and ask her to\nsuggest somewhere for his daughter to live in London.",

    "Very well then.",
    "That is a statement and I\nnote it.",
    "Do you think you are going to find those papers I have other enquiries in hand said Poirot.",
    "Sir Rodericks papers will have to take their turn.",

    "He is very worried.",
    "There is something that I cannot say to him.",

    "Oh I know.",
    "You suspect me.",
    "Everyone suspects me because I am foreign.",
    "Because I come from a foreign country\nand so they think \u2014 they think I steal secret papers like in one of your silly English spy stories.",
    "I am not\nlike that.",
    "I am an intellectual.",
    "Aha said Poirot.",
    "It is always nice to know.",
    "He added Is there\nanything else you wish to tell me Why should I One never knows.",
    "What are these other cases you\nspeak of Ah I do not want to detain you.",

    "She stiffened... She shot him an angry questioning glance.",
    "Why do you say Kew Gardens Because there are some very fine plants and shrubs and trees there.",
    "Ah you should not miss Kew Gardens.",
    "The admission fee is very small.",
    "A penny I think or twopence.",

    "But I must not detain\nyou.",
    "Mademoiselle.",
    "You have perhaps friends to visit at one of the Embassies maybe.",
    "Why do you say\nthat No particular reason.",

    "Someone has told you things.",
    "Someone has made\naccusations against me I tell you he is a silly old man who mislays things.",
    "That is all And he knows nothing of importance.",

    "He never has\nhad.",
    "Ah but you are not quite thinking of what you are saying.",

    "I think she\ngoes up to London or to other places to meet other men.",
    "To meet at any rate one other man.",
    "Indeed\nsaid Poirot that is very interesting.",
    "You think she goes to meet another man Yes I do.",
    "She goes up\nto London very often and I do not think she always tells her husband or she says it is shopping or things\nshe has to buy.",
    "All those sort of things.",
    "He is busy in the office and he does not think of why his wife\ncomes up.",
    "She is more in London than she is in the country.",
    "And yet she pretends to like gardening so much.",
    "You have no idea who this man is whom she meets\n\n\fHow should I know I do not follow her.",
    "Mr. Restarick is not a suspicious man.",
    "He believes what his wife tells him.",
    "He thinks perhaps about business all the time.",
    "And too I think he is worried about his daughter.",
    "Yes said Poirot he is certainly worried about his\ndaughter.",
    "How much do you know about the daughter How well do you know her I do not know\nher very well.",
    "If you ask what I think\u2014well I tell you I think she is mad.",

    "She sees things that are not there.",
    "Sees things that are not\nthere People that are not there.",
    "Sometimes she is very excited and other times she seems as though\nshe is in a dream.",
    "You speak to her and she does not hear what you say to her.",
    "She does not answer.",
    "I think there are people who she would like to have dead.",
    "You mean Mrs. Restarick And her father.",
    "She looks at him as though she hates him.",
    "Because they are both trying to prevent her marrying a young\nman of her choice Yes.",
    "They do not want that to happen.",
    "They are quite right of course but it makes her angry.",
    "Some day added Sonia nodding her head\ncheerfully I think she will kill herself.",
    "I hope she will do nothing so foolish but that is the thing one does\nwhen one is much in love.",
    "She shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Well \u2014 I go now.",
    "Just tell me one thing.",
    "Does\nMrs.\nRestarick wear a wig A wig How should I know she considered for a moment.",

    "CHAPTER SIXTEEN\nTODAY I have much to do Hercule Poirot announced as he rose from the breakfast table next\nmorning and joined Miss Lemon.",
    "Enquiries to make.",
    "You have made the necessary researches for me\nthe appointments the necessary contacts Certainly said Miss Lemon.",
    "It is all here She handed him\na small briefcase.",
    "Poirot took a quick glance at its contents and nodded his head.",
    "I can always rely on you.",
    "Miss Lemon he said.",
    "Cest fantastique.",
    "Really Monsieur Poirot I cannot\nsee anything fantastic about it.",
    "You gave me instructions and I carried them out.",
    "Naturally.",
    "Pah it is not so natural as that said Poirot.",
    "Do I not give instructions often to the gas men\nthe electricians the man who comes to repair things and do they always carry out my instructions Very\nvery seldom.",
    "He went into the hall.",
    "My slightly heavier overcoat Georges.",
    "I think the autumn chill is setting in.",
    "He popped his head back in his secretarys room.",
    "By the way what\ndid you think of that young woman who came yesterday Miss Lemon arrested as she was about to\nplunge her fingers on the typewriter said briefly Foreign.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "Obviously foreign.",
    "You do not\nthink anything more about her than that Miss Lemon considered.",
    "I had no means of judging her\ncapability in any way.",
    "She added rather doubtfully She seemed upset about something.",
    "Yes.",
    "She is\nsuspected you see of stealing Not money but papers from her employer.",
    "Dear dear said Miss\nLemon.",
    "Important papers It seems highly probable.",
    "It is equally probable though that he has not lost anything\nat all.",
    "Oh well said Miss Lemon giving her employer a special look that she always gave and which\nannounced that she wished to get rid of him so that she could get on with proper fervour with her work.",
    "Well I always say that its better to know where you are when you are employing someone and buy\nBritish.",
    "Hercule Poirot went out.",
    "His first visit was to Borodene Mansions.",
    "He took a taxi.",
    "Alighting at the courtyard he cast his eyes around.",
    "A uniformed porter was standing in one of the\ndoorways whistling a somewhat doleful melody.",
    "As Poirot advanced upon him he said Yes sir I\nwondered said Poirot if you can tell me anything about a very sad occurrence that took place here\nrecently.",
    "Sad occurrence said the porter.",
    "Nothing that I know of.",
    "A lady who threw herself or shall we say fell from one of the upper stories\nand was killed.",
    "Oh that.",
    "I dont know anything about that because Ive only been here a week you see.",
    "Hi Joe.",
    "A porter emerging from the opposite side of the block came over.",
    "Youd know about the lady as fell from the seventh.",
    "About a month ago was it Not quite as much as\nthat said Joe.",
    "He was an elderly slowspeaking man.",
    "Nasty business it was.",
    "She was killed instantly Yes.",
    "What was her name It may you understand\nhave been a relative of mine Poirot explained.",
    "He was not a man who had any scruples about departing\nfrom the truth.",
    "Indeed sir.",
    "Very sorry to hear it.",
    "She was a Mrs. Charpentier.",
    "She had been in the flat some time Well let me see now.",
    "About a year\n\u2014 a year and a half perhaps.",
    "No I think it must have been about two years.",
    "No.",
    "76 seventh floor.",
    "That is the top floor Yes sir.",
    "A Mrs. Charpentier.",
    "Poirot did not press for any other descriptive\ninformation since he might be presumed to know such things about his own relative.",
    "Instead he asked\nDid it cause much excitement much questioning What time of day was it Five or six oclock in the\nmorning I think.",
    "No warning or anything.",
    "Just down she came.",
    "In spite of being so early we got a crowd\nalmost at once pushing through the railing over there.",
    "You know what people are.",
    "And the police of\ncourse.",
    "Oh yes the police came quite quickly.",
    "And a doctor and an ambulance.",
    "All the usual said the porter rather in the weary tone of one who had\nhad people throwing themselves out of a seventhstorey window once or twice every month.",
    "And I suppose people came down from the flats when they heard what had happened.",
    "Oh there\nwasnt so many coming from the flats because for one thing with the noise of traffic and everything around\nhere most of them didnt know about it.",
    "Someone or other said she gave a bit of a scream as she came down but not so that it caused any real\ncommotion.",
    "It was only people in the street passing by who saw it happen.",
    "And then of course they\ncraned their necks over the railings and other people saw them craning and joined them.",
    "You know what an accident is Poirot assured him he knew what an accident was.",
    "She lived alone he said making it only half a question.",
    "Thats right.",
    "But she had friends I suppose among the other flat dwellers Joe shrugged and shook\nhis head.",
    "May have done.",
    "I couldnt say.",
    "Never saw her in the restaurant much with any of our lot.",
    "She had outside friends to dinner here sometimes.",
    "No I wouldnt say she was specially pally with\nanybody here.",
    "Youd do best said Joe getting slightly restive to go and have a chat with Mr.\nMcFarlane whos in charge here if you want to know about her.",
    "Ah I thank you.",
    "Yes that is what I\nmean to do.",
    "His office is in that block over there sir.",
    "On the ground floor.",
    "Youll see it marked up on\nthe door.",
    "Poirot went as directed.",
    "He detached from his briefcase the top letter with which Miss\nLemon had supplied him and which was marked Mr. McFarlane.",
    "Mr. McFarlane turned out to be a goodlooking shrewdlooking man of about fortyfive.",
    "Poirot handed\nhim the letter.",
    "He opened and read it.",
    "Ah yes he said I see.",
    "He laid it down on the desk and looked at Poirot.",
    "The owners have instructed me to give you all the help I can about the sad death of Mrs. Louise\nCharpentier.",
    "Now what do you want to know exactly.",
    "Monsieur  he glanced at the letter again Monsieur Poirot This is of course all quite confidential said Poirot.",
    "Her relatives have been\ncommunicated with by the police and by a solicitor but they were anxious as I was coming to England\nthat I should get a few more personal facts if you understand me.",
    "It is distressing when one can get only\nofficial reports.",
    "Yes quite so.",
    "Yes I quite understand that it must be.",
    "Well Ill tell you anything lean.",
    "How long had she been here and how did she come to take the flat Shed been here  I can look it\nup exactly  about two years.",
    "There was a vacant tenancy and I imagine that the lady who was leaving\nbeing an acquaintance of hers told her in advance that she was giving it up.",
    "That was a Mrs. Wilder\nWorked for the B.B.C.",
    "Had been in London for some time but was going to Canada.",
    "Very nice lady \u2014\nI dont think she knew the deceased well at all.",
    "Just happened to mention she was giving up the flat.",
    "Mrs.\nCharpentier liked the flat.",
    "You found her a suitable tenant There was a very faint hesitation before\nMr. McFarlane answered She was a satisfactory tenant yes.",
    "You need not mind telling me said\nHercule Poirot.",
    "There were wild parties eh A little too \u2014 shall we say \u2014 gay in her entertaining Mr.\nMcFarlane stopped being so discreet.",
    "There were a few complaints from time to time but mostly from elderly people.",
    "Hercule Poirot made a\nsignificant gesture.",
    "A bit too fond of the bottle yes sir \u2014 and in with quite a gay lot.",
    "It made for a bit of trouble now and\nagain.",
    "And she was fond of the gentlemen Well I wouldnt like to go as far as that.59 No no but\none understands.",
    "Of course she wasnt so young.",
    "Appearances are very often deceptive.",
    "How old would you have said she was Its difficult to say.",
    "Fortyfortyfive.",
    "He added Her health\nwasnt good you know.",
    "So I understand.",
    "She drank too much  no doubt about it.",
    "And then shed\nget very depressed.",
    "Nervous about herself.",
    "Always going to doctors I believe and not believing what they told her.",
    "Ladies\ndo get it into their heads  especially about that time of life she thought that she had cancer.",
    "Was quite\nsure of it.",
    "The doctor reassured her but she didnt believe him.",
    "He said at the inquest that there was\nnothing really wrong with her.",
    "Oh well one hears of things like that every day.",
    "She got all worked up and\none final day  he nodded.",
    "It is very sad said Poirot.",
    "Did she have any special friends among the residents of the flats Not that\n\n\fI know of.",
    "This place you see isnt what I call the matey kind.",
    "Theyre mostly people in business in jobs.",
    "I was thinking possibly of Miss Claudia ReeceHolland.",
    "I\nwondered if they had known each other.",
    "Miss ReeceHolland No I dont think so.",
    "Oh I mean they\nwere probably acquaintances talked when they went up in the lift together that sort of thing.",
    "But I dont\nthink there was much social contact of any kind.",
    "You see they would be in a different generation.",
    "I\nmean\u2014 Mr.\nMcFarlane seemed a little flustered.",
    "Poirot wondered why.",
    "He said One of the other girls who share Miss Hollands flat knew Mrs.\nCharpentier I believe\u2014Miss Norma Restarick.",
    "Did she I wouldnt know \u2014 shes only come here\nquite recently I hardly know her by sight.",
    "Rather a frightenedlooking young lady.",
    "Not long out of school\nId say.",
    "He added Is there anything more I can do for you sir No thank you.",
    "Youve been most\nkind.",
    "I wonder if possibly I could see the flat.",
    "Just in order to be able to say \u2014 Poirot paused not particularising what he wanted to be able to say.",
    "Well now let me see.",
    "A Mr. Travers has got it now.",
    "Hes in the City all day.",
    "Yes come up with me if you like sir.",
    "They went up to the seventh floor.",
    "As Mr. McFarlane introduced\nhis key one of the numbers fell from the door and narrowly avoided Poirots patentleather shoe.",
    "He\nhopped nimbly and then bent to pick it up.",
    "He replaced the spike which fixed it on the door very\ncarefully.",
    "These numbers are loose he said.",
    "Im very sorry sir.",
    "Ill make a note of it.",
    "Yes they wear loose from time to time.",
    "Well here we are.",
    "Poirot went into the livingroom.",
    "At the moment it had little personality.",
    "The walls\nwere papered with a paper resembling grained wood.",
    "It had conventional comfortable furniture the only\npersonal touch was a television set and a certain number of books.",
    "All the flats are partly furnished you see said Mr. McFarlane.",
    "The tenants dont need to bring anything\nof their own unless they want to.",
    "We cater very largely for people who come and go.",
    "And the\ndecorations are all the same Not entirely.",
    "People seem to like this raw wood effect.",
    "Good background\nfor pictures.",
    "The only things that are different are on the one wall facing the door.",
    "We have a whole set of\nfrescoes which people can choose from.",
    "We have a set of ten said Mr. McFarlane with some pride.",
    "There is the Japanese onevery artistic\ndont you think  and there is an English garden one a very striking one of birds one of trees a\nHarlequin one a rather interesting abstract effect  lines and cubes in vividly contrasting colours that\nsort of thing.",
    "Theyre all designs by good artists.",
    "Our furniture is all the same.",
    "Two choices of colours or of course\npeople can add what they like of their own.",
    "But they dont usually bother.",
    "Most of them are not as you\n\n\fmight say homemakers Poirot suggested.",
    "No rather the bird of passage type or busy people who want solid comfort good plumbing and all that\nbut arent particularly interested in decoration though weve had one or two of the doityourself type\nwhich isnt really satisfactory from our point of view.",
    "Weve had to put a clause in the lease saying theyve\ngot to put things back as they found them  or pay for that being done.",
    "They seemed to be getting\nrather far away from the subject of Mrs. Charpentiers death.",
    "Poirot approached the window.",
    "It was from here he murmured delicately.",
    "Yes.",
    "Thats the window.",
    "The lefthand one.",
    "It has a balcony.",
    "Poirot looked out down below.",
    "Seven floors he said.",
    "A long way.",
    "Yes death was instantaneous I am glad to say.",
    "Of course it\nmight have been an accident.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "You cannot seriously suggest that Mr.\nMcFarlane.",
    "It must have been deliberate.",
    "Well one always likes to suggest an easier possibility.",
    "She\nwasnt a happy woman Im afraid.",
    "Thank you said Poirot for your great courtesy.",
    "I shall be able to\ngive her relations in France a very clear picture.",
    "His own picture of what had occurred was not as clear\nas he would have liked.",
    "So far there had been nothing to support his theory that the death of Louise Charpentier had been\nimportant.",
    "He repeated the Christian name thoughtfully.",
    "Louise... Why had the name Louise some haunting memory about it He shook his head.",
    "He thanked\nMr. McFarlane and left.",
    "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nCHIEF INSPECTOR NEELE was sitting behind his desk looking very official and formal.",
    "He greeted\nPoirot politely and motioned him to a chair.",
    "As soon as the young man who had introduced Poirot to the\npresence had left Chief Inspector Neeles manner changed.",
    "And what are you after now you secretive old devil he said.",
    "As to that said Poirot you already know.",
    "Oh yes Ive rustled up some stuff but I dont think theres\nmuch for you from that particular hole.",
    "Why call it a hole Because youre so exactly like a good\nmouser.",
    "A cat sitting over a hole waiting for the mouse to come out.",
    "Well if you ask me there isnt any\nmouse in this particular hole.",
    "Mind you I dont say that you couldnt unearth some dubious transactions.",
    "You know these financiers.",

    "He wasnt an elephant hunter or an archaeologist or a plant man or\nany of those things.",
    "All his deals were business deals and they always turned out well.",

    "Goodlooking woman a good deal\nyounger than he is.",
    "At the moment theyre living with old Sir Roderick Horsefield whose sister had married Andrew\nRestaricks uncle.",
    "But I imagine thats only temporary.",
    "Is any of this news to you Or do you know it all\nalready Ive heard most of it said Poirot.",
    "Is there any insanity in the family on either side Shouldnt\nthink so apart from old Auntie and her fancy religions.",
    "And thats not unusual in a woman who lives\nalone.",
    "So all you can tell me really is that there is a lot of money said Poirot.",
    "Lots of money said Chief Inspector Neele.",
    "And all quite respectable.",
    "Some of it mark you Andrew\nRestarick brought into the firm.",
    "South African concessions mines mineral deposits.",

    "And\nwho will inherit it said Poirot.",
    "That depends on how Andrew Restarick leaves it.",
    "Its up to him but Id say that theres no one obvious\nexcept his wife and his daughter.",

    "Poirot looked down at a neatly written list in his hand.",
    "What about the Wedderburn Gallery I wondered how youd got on to that.",
    "Were you consulted by a client about a forgery Do they deal in forgeries People dont deal in\nforgeries said Chief Inspector Neele reprovingly.",
    "There was a rather unpleasant business.",
    "A millionaire from Texas over here buying pictures and paying\nincredible sums for them.",
    "They sold him a Renoir and a Van Gogh.",
    "The Renoir was a small head of a girl\nand there was some query about it.",
    "There seemed no reason to believe that the Wedderburn Gallery had not bought it in the first place in all\ngood faith.",
    "There was a case about it.",
    "A great many art experts came and gave their verdicts.",
    "In fact as\nusual in the end they all seemed to contradict each other.",
    "The gallery offered to take it back in any case.",
    "However the millionaire didnt change his mind since the latest fashionable expert swore that it was\nperfectly genuine.",
    "So he stuck to it.",
    "All the same theres been a bit of suspicion hanging round the gallery ever since.",

    "What about Sir Roderick Horsefield Nice old boy but gaga.",
    "What a nose you have Poirot get it into\neverything dont you Yes theres been a lot of trouble in the Special Branch.",
    "Its this craze for memoirs.",
    "Nobody knows what indiscreet revelations are going to be made next.",

    "Cabinets change their policies and you dont want to affront someones susceptibilities or give the\nwrong publicity so we have to try and muffle the old boys.",
    "Some of them are not too easy.",
    "But youll\nhave to go to the Special Branch if you want to nose into any of that.",
    "I shouldnt think there was much\nwrong.",
    "The trouble is they dont destroy the papers they should.",
    "They keep the lot.",
    "However I dont\nthink there is much in that but we have evidence that a certain Power is nosing around.",
    "Poirot gave a\ndeep sigh.",
    "Havent I helped asked the Chief Inspector.",
    "I am very glad to get the real lowdown from official quarters.",
    "But no I dont think there is much help in\nwhat you have told me.",
    "He sighed and then said What would be your opinion if someone said to you\ncasually that a woman  a young attractive woman  wore a wig Nothing in that said Chief\nInspector Neele and added with slight asperity my wife wears a wig when were travelling any time.",
    "It\nsaves a lot of trouble.",
    "I beg your pardon said Hercule Poirot.",
    "As the two men bade each other goodbye the Chief Inspector asked You got all the dope I suppose\non that suicide case you were asking about in the flats I had it sent round to you.",
    "Yes thank you.",
    "The\nofficial facts at least.",
    "A bare record.",
    "There was something you were talking about just now that\nbrought it back to my mind.",
    "Ill think of it in a moment.",
    "It was the usual rather sad story.",
    "Gay woman\nfond of men enough money to live upon no particular worries drank too much and went down the hill.",
    "And then she gets what I call the health bug.",
    "You know theyre convinced they have cancer or something\nin that line.",
    "They consult a doctor and he tells them theyre all right and they go home and dont believe\nhim.",

    "Theyre lonely I suppose poor devils.",
    "Mrs. Charpentier was just one of them.",

    "Oh yes of course I\nremember.",
    "You were asking about one of our M.P.s.",
    "ReeceHolland.",
    "Hes a fairly gay one himself in a discreet way.",
    "Anyway Louise Charpentier was his\nmistress at one time.",
    "Thats all.",
    "Was it a serious liaison Oh I shouldnt say so particularly.",
    "They went to some rather questionable clubs together and things like that.",
    "You know we keep a discreet\neye on things of that kind.",
    "But there was never anything in the Press about them.",
    "Nothing of that kind.",
    "I\nsee.",
    "But it lasted for a certain time.",
    "They were seen together off and on for about six months but I\ndont think she was the only one and I dont think he was the only one either.",
    "So you cant make anything\nof that can you I do not think so said Poirot.",
    "But all the same he said to himself as he went down the stairs all the same it is a link.",
    "It explains the\nembarrassment of Mr. McFarlane.",
    "It is a link a tiny link a link between Ernlyn ReeceHolland m.p.",
    "and\nLouise Charpentier.",
    "It didnt mean anything probably.",
    "Why should it\nBut yet I know too much said Poirot angrily to himself.",
    "I know too much.",
    "I know a little about\neverything and everyone but I cannot get my pattern.",
    "Half these facts are irrelevant.",
    "I want a pattern.",
    "A pattern.",
    "My kingdom for a pattern he said aloud.",
    "I beg your pardon sir said the lift boy turning a startled head.",
    "It is nothing said Poirot.",
    "CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\nPOIROT paused at the doorway of the Wedderburn Gallery to inspect a picture which depicted three\naggressivelooking cows with vastly elongated bodies overshadowed by a colossal and complicated\ndesign of windmills.",
    "The two seemed to have nothing to do with each other or the very curious purple\ncolouring.",
    "Interesting isnt it said a soft purring voice.",
    "A middleaged man who at first sight seemed to have shown a smile which exhibited an almost excessive\nnumber of beautiful white teeth was at his elbow.",
    "cc Such freshness.",
    "He had large white plump hands\nwhich he waved as though he was using them in an arabesque.",
    "Clever exhibition.",
    "Closed last week.",
    "Claude Raphael show opened the day before yesterday.",
    "Its going to do well.",
    "Very well indeed.",
    "Ah said Poirot and was led through grey velvet curtains into a long room.",
    "Poirot made a few cautious if doubtful remarks.",
    "The plump man took him in hand in a practised manner.",
    "Here was someone he obviously felt who must not be frightened away.",
    "He was a very experienced man\nin the art of salesmanship.",
    "You felt at once that you were welcome to be in his gallery all day if you liked without making a\npurchase.",
    "Sheerly solely looking at these delightful pictures  though when you entered the gallery you\n\n\fmight not have thought that they were delightful.",
    "But by the time you went out you were convinced that\ndelightful was exactly the word to describe them.",
    "After receiving some useful artistic instruction and\nmaking a few of the amateurs stock remarks such as I rather like that one Mr. Boscombe responded\nencouragingly by some such phrase as Now thats very interesting that you should say that.",
    "It shows if I\nmay say so great perspicacity.",
    "Of course you know it isnt the ordinary reaction.",
    "Most people prefer\nsomethingwell shall I say slightly obvious like that  he pointed to a blue and green striped effect\narranged in one corner of the canvas  but this yes youve spotted the quality of the thing.",
    "Id say myselfof course its only my personal opinion  that thats one of Raphaels masterpieces.",
    "Poirot and he looked together with both their heads on one side at an orange lopsided diamond with\ntwo human eyes depending from it by what looked like a spidery thread.",
    "Pleasant relations established\nand time obviously being infinite Poirot remarked I think a Miss Frances Cary works for you does she\nnot Ah yes.",
    "Frances.",
    "Clever girl that.",
    "Very artistic and very competent too.",
    "Just come back from Portugal where shes been arranging an art show for us.",
    "Very successful.",
    "Quite a\ngood artist herself but not I should say really creative if you understand me.",
    "She is better on the business\nside.",
    "I think she recognises that herself.",
    "I understand that she is a good patron of the arts Oh yes.",
    "Shes interested in Les Jeunes.",
    "Encourages talent persuaded me to give a show for a little group of young\nartists last spring.",
    "It was quite successful  the Press noticed it \u2014 all in a small way you understand.",
    "Yes she has her proteges.",
    "I am you understand somewhat oldfashioned.",
    "Some of these young men\u2014 vraimentV Poirots hands went up.",
    "Ah said Mr. Boscombe indulgently you mustnt go by their appearance.",
    "Its just a fashion you know.",
    "Beards and jeans or brocades and hair.",
    "Just a passing phase.",
    "David someone said Poirot.",
    "I forgot his\nlast name.",
    "Miss Cary seemed to think highly of him.",
    "Sure you dont mean Peter Cardiff\nHes her present protege.",
    "Mind you Im not quite so sure about him as she is.",
    "Hes really not so much\navant garde as he is \u2014 well positively reactionary.",
    "Quite \u2014 quite \u2014 BurneJones sometimes Still one\nnever knows.",
    "You do get these reactions.",
    "She acts as his model occasionally.",
    "David Baker \u2014 that was\nthe name I was trying to remember said Poirot.",
    "He is not bad said Mr. Boscombe without enthusiasm.",
    "Not much originality in my opinion.",
    "He was\none of the group of artists I mentioned but he didnt make any particular impression.",
    "A good painter\nnimd but not striking.",
    "Derivative Poirot went home.",
    "Miss Lemon presented him with letters to sign and\ndeparted with them duly signed.",
    "George served him with an omelette fines herbes garnished as you might\nsay with a discreetly sympathetic manner.",
    "After lunch as Poirot was settling himself in his squarebacked\narmchair with his coffee at his elbow the telephone rang.",
    "Mrs. Oliver sir said George lifting the telephone and placing it at his elbow.",
    "Poirot picked up the receiver reluctantly.",
    "He did not want to talk to Mrs. Oliver.",
    "He felt that she would urge upon him something which he did not\nwant to do.",
    "M. Poirot Cestmoi.",
    "Well what are you doing What have you done I am sitting in this chair\nsaid Poirot.",
    "Thinking he added.",
    "Is that all said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "It is the important thing said Poirot.",
    "Whether I shall have success in it or not I do not know.",
    "But you must find that girl.",
    "Shes probably\nbeen kidnapped.",
    "It would certainly seem so said Poirot.",
    "And I have a letter here which came by the midday post from her father urging me to come and see him\nand tell him what progress I have made.",
    "Well what progress have you made At the moment said\nPoirot reluctantly none.",
    "Really M. Poirot you really must take a grip on yourself.",
    "You too What\ndo you mean me too Urging me on.",
    "Why dont you go down to that place in Chelsea where I was\nhit on the head.",
    "And get myself hit on the head also I simply dont understand you said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "J gave you a clue by finding the girl in the cafe.",
    "You said so.",
    "I know I know.",
    "And then you go and\nlose her I know I know.",
    "What about that woman who threw herself out of a window.",
    "Havent you\ngot anything out of that I have made enquiries yes.",
    "Well Nothing.",
    "The woman is one of many.",
    "They are attractive when young they have affairs they are passionate they have still more affairs they\nget less attractive they are unhappy and drink too much they think they have cancer or some fatal\ndisease and so at last in despair and loneliness they throw themselves out of a window You said her\ndeath was important  that it meant something.",
    "It ought to have done.",
    "Really At a loss for further\ncomment Mrs. Oliver rang off.",
    "Poirot leant back in his armchair as far as he could lean back since it was of an upright nature waved to\nGeorge to remove the coffee pot and also the telephone and proceeded to reflect upon what he did or\ndid not know.",
    "To clarify his thoughts he spoke out loud.",
    "He recalled three philosophic questions.",
    "What do I know What can I hope\nWhat ought I to do He was not sure that he got them in the right order or indeed if they were quite the\nright questions but he reflected upon them.",
    "Perhaps I am too old said Hercule Poirot at the bottom depths of despair.",
    "What do I know Upon reflection he thought that he knew too much He laid that question aside for the\nmoment.",
    "What can I hope Well one could always hope.",
    "He could hope that those excellent brains of his so\nmuch better than anybody elses would come up sooner or later with an answer to a problem which he\nfelt uneasily that he did not really understand.",
    "What ought I to do Well that was very definite.",
    "What he ought to do was to go and call upon Mr.\nAndrew Restarick who obviously distraught about his daughter and who would no doubt blame Poirot\nfor not having by now delivered the daughter in person.",
    "Poirot could understand that and sympathised\nwith his point of view but disliked having to present himself in such a very unfavourable light.",
    "The only\nother thing he could do was to telephone to a certain number and ask what developments there had\nbeen.",
    "But before he did that he would go back to the question he had laid aside.",
    "What do I know He knew that the Wedderburn Gallery was under suspicion  so far it had kept on\nthe right side of the law but it would not hesitate at swindling ignorant millionaires by selling them dubious\npictures.",
    "He recalled Mr. Boscombe with his plump white hands and his plentiful teeth and decided that he did not\nlike him.",
    "He was the kind of man who was almost certainly up to dirty work though he would no doubt\nprotect himself remarkably well.",
    "That was a fact that might come into use because it might connect up\nwith David Baker.",
    "Then there was David Baker himself the Peacock.",
    "What did he know about him He\nhad met him he had conversed with him and he had formed certain opinions about him.",
    "He would do a\ncrooked deal of any kind for money he would marry a rich heiress for her money and not for love he\nmight perhaps be bought off.",
    "Yes he probably could be bought off.",
    "Andrew Restarick certainly believed\nso and he was probably right.",
    "Unless  He considered Andrew Restarick thinking more of the picture\non the wall hanging above him than of the man himself.",
    "He remembered the strong features the jutting out\nchin the air of resolution of decision.",
    "Then he thought of Mrs. Andrew Restarick deceased.",
    "The bitter lines of her mouth... Perhaps he would\ngo down to Crosshedges again and look at that portrait so as to see it more clearly because there might\nbe a clue to Norma in that.",
    "Norma \u2014 no he must not think of Norma yet.",
    "What else was there\nThere was Mary Restarick whom the girl Sonia said must have a lover because she went up to London\nso often.",
    "He considered that point but he did not think that Sonia was right.",
    "He thought Mrs.\nRestarick was much more likely to go to London in order to look at possible properties to buy luxury\nflats houses in Mayfair decorators all the things that money in the metropolis could buy.",
    "Money...",
    "It seemed to him that all the points that had been passing through his mind came to this in the\nend.",
    "Money.",
    "The importance of money.",
    "There was a great deal of money in this case.",
    "Somehow in some way that\nwas not obvious money counted.",
    "Money played its part.",
    "So far there had been nothing to justify his\nbelief that the tragic death of Mrs.\nCharpentier had been the work of Norma.",
    "No sign of evidence no motive yet it seemed to him that there was an undeniable link.",
    "The girl had said\nthat she might have committed a murder.",
    "A death had taken place only a day or two previously.",
    "A death that had occurred in the building where she lived.",
    "Surely it would be too much of a coincidence\nthat that death should not be connected in any way\nHe thought again of the mysterious illness which had affected Mary Restarick.",
    "An occurrence so simple\nas to be classic in its outline.",
    "A poison case where the poisoner was \u2014 must be \u2014 one of the household.",
    "Had Mary Restarick poisoned herself had her husband tried to poison her had the girl Sonia\nadministered poison Or had Norma been the culprit.",
    "Everything pointed Hercule Poirot had to confess\nto Norma as being the logical person.",
    "Tout de meme said Poirot since I cannot find anything et bien then the logic falls out of the window.",
    "He sighed rose to his feet and told George to fetch him a taxi.",
    "He must keep his appointment with\n\n\fAndrew Restarick.",
    "CHAPTER NINETEEN\nCLAUDIA REECEHOLLAND was not in the office today.",
    "Instead a middleaged woman received\nPoirot.",
    "She said that Mr. Restarick was waiting for him and ushered him into Restaricks room.",
    "Well Restarick hardly waited until he had come through the door.",
    "Well what about my daughter\nPoirot spread out his hands.",
    "As yetnothing.",
    "But look here man there must be something  some clue.",
    "A girl cant just disappear\ninto thin air.",
    "Girls have done it before now and will do it again.",
    "Did you understand that no expense\nwas to be spared none whatever I  I cant go on like this.",
    "He seemed completely on edge by this\ntime.",
    "He looked thinner and his rednmmed eyes spoke of sleepless nights.",
    "I know what your anxiety must be but I assure you that I have done everything possible to trace her.",
    "These things alas cannot be hurried.",
    "She may have lost her memory or \u2014 or she may \u2014 I mean she\nmight be sick.",
    "Poirot thought he knew what the broken form of the sentence meant.",
    "Restarick had been\nabout to say she may perhaps be dead.",
    "He sat down the other side of the desk and said Believe me\nI appreciate your anxiety and I have to say to you once again that the results would be a lot quicker if\nyou consulted the police.",
    "No  The word broke out explosively.",
    "They have greater facilities more lines of enquiry.",
    "I assure you it is not only a question of money.",
    "Money\ncannot give you the same result as a highly efficient organisation can do.",
    "Man its no use talking in that\nsoothing way.",
    "Norma is my daughter.",
    "My only daughter the only flesh and blood Ive got.",
    "Are you sure\nthat you have told me everything \u2014 everything possible \u2014 about your daughter What more can I tell\nyou.",
    "That is for you to say not me.",
    "Have there been for instance any incidents in the past Such as\nWhat do you mean man Any definite history of mental instability.",
    "You think that  that   How do I know How can I know And how do I know said Restarick\nsuddenly bitter.",
    "What do I know of her\nAll these years.",
    "Grace was a bitter woman.",
    "A woman who did not easily forgive or forget.",
    "Sometimes I feel  I feel that she was the wrong person\nto have brought Normaup.",
    "He got up walked up and down the room and then sat down again.",
    "Of course I shouldnt have left my wife.",
    "I know that.",
    "I left her to bring up the child.",
    "But then at the time I\nsuppose I made excuses for myself.",
    "Grace was a woman of excellent character devoted to Norma.",
    "A\nthoroughly good guardian for her.",
    "But was she Was she really Some of the letters Grace wrote to me\nwere as though they breathed anger and revenge.",
    "Well I suppose thats natural enough.",
    "But I was away all those years.",
    "I should have come back come\nback more often and found out how the child was getting on.",
    "I suppose I had a bad conscience.",
    "Oh its\nno good making excuses now.",
    "He turned his head sharply.",
    "Yes.",
    "I did think when I saw her again that Normas whole attitude was neurotic indisciplined.",
    "I hoped\nshe and Mary would \u2014 would get on better after a little while but I have to admit that I dont feel the girl\nwas entirely normal.",
    "I felt it would be better for her to have a job in London and come home for\n\n\fweekends but not to be forced into Marys company the whole time.",
    "Oh I suppose Ive made a mess of\neverything.",
    "But where is she M. Poirot\nWhere is she Do you think she may have lost her memory One hears of such things.",
    "Yes said\nPoirot that is a possibility.",
    "In her state she may be wandering about quite unaware of who she is.",
    "Or she may have had an accident.",
    "That is less likely.",
    "I can assure you that I have made all enquiries in hospitals and other places.",
    "You dont think she is \u2014\nyou dont think shes dead She would be easier to find dead than alive I can assure you.",
    "Please calm\nyourself Mr. Restarick.",
    "Remember she may have friends of whom you know nothing.",
    "Friends in any part\nof England friends whom she has known while living with her mother or with her aunt or friends who\nwere friends of school friends of hers.",
    "All these things take time to sort out.",
    "It may be  you must\nprepare yourself  that she is with a boyfriend of some kind.",
    "David Baker If I thought that   She\nis not with David Baker.",
    "That said Poirot dryly I ascertained first of all.",
    "How do I know what friends\nshe has He sighed.",
    "If I find her when I find her  Id rather put it that way  Im going to take her out\nof all this.",
    "Out of all what Out of this country.",
    "I have been miserable M. Poirot miserable ever since\nI returned here.",
    "I always hated City life.",
    "The boring round of office routine continual consultations with lawyers and financiers.",
    "The life I liked was\nalways the same.",
    "Travelling moving about from place to place going to wild and inaccessible places.",
    "Thats the life for me.",
    "I should never have left it.",
    "I should have sent for Norma to come out to me and as\nI say when I find her thats what Im going to do.",
    "Already Im being approached with various takeover\nbids.",
    "Well they can have the whole caboodle on very advantageous terms.",
    "Ill take the cash and go back\nto a country that means something thats real.",
    "Aha And what will your wife say to that Mary Shes\nused to that life.",
    "Thats where she comes from.",
    "To les femmes with plenty of money said Poirot\nLondon can be very attractive.",
    "Shell see it my way.",
    "The telephone rang on his desk.",
    "He picked it up.",
    "Yes Oh.",
    "From Manchester Yes.",
    "If its Claudia ReeceHolland put her through.",
    "He waited a minute.",
    "Hallo Claudia.",
    "Yes.",
    "Speak up  its a very bad line I cant hear you.",
    "They agreed... Ah pity... No I\nthink you did very well...",
    "Right... All right then.",
    "Take the evening train back.",

    "Thats a competent girl he said.",
    "Miss ReeceHolland Yes.",
    "Unusually competent.",
    "Takes a lot of bother off my shoulders.",
    "I gave her\npretty well carte blanche to put through this deal in Manchester on her own terms.",
    "I really felt I couldnt\nconcentrate.",
    "And shes done exceedingly well.",
    "Shes as good as a man in some ways.",
    "He looked at\nPoirot suddenly bringing himself back to the present.",
    "Ah yes M. Poirot.",
    "Well Im afraid Ive rather lost my grip.",
    "Do you need more money for expenses\nNo Monsieur.",
    "I assure you that I will do my utmost to restore your daughter sound and well.",
    "I have\ntaken all possible precautions for her safety.",

    "When he reached the street he looked up at the sky.",
    "A definite answer to one question he said that is what I need.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY\nHERCULE POIROT looked up at the facade of the dignified Georgian house in what had been until\nrecently a quiet street in an oldfashioned market town.",
    "Progress was rapidly overtaking it but the new\nsupermarket the Gifte Shoppe Margerys Boutique Pegs Cafe and a palatial new bank had all chosen\nsites in Croft Road and not encroached on the narrow High Street.",
    "The brass knocker on the door was brightly polished Poirot noted with approval.",
    "He pressed the bell at\nthe side.",
    "It was opened almost at once by a tall distinguishedlooking woman with upswept grey hair and an\nenergetic manner.",
    "M. Poirot You are very punctual.",
    "Come in.",
    "Miss Battersby Certainly.",
    "She held back the door.",
    "Poirot entered.",
    "She deposited his hat on the hall stand and led the way to a pleasant room overlooking a\nnarrow walled garden.",
    "She waved towards a chair and sat down herself in an attitude of expectation.",
    "It was clear that Miss\nBattersby was not one to lose time in conventional utterances.",
    "You are I think the former Principal ofMeadowfield School Yes.",
    "I retired a year ago.",
    "I understand\nyou wished to see me on the subject of Norma Restarick a former pupil.",
    "That is right.",
    "In your letter\nsaid Miss Battersby you gave me no further details.",
    "She added I may say that I know who you are\nM. Poirot.",
    "I should therefore like a little more information before I proceed further.",
    "Are you for instance\nthinking of employing Norma Restarick That is not my intention no.",
    "Knowing what your profession\nis you understand why I should want further details.",
    "Have you for instance an introduction to me from\nany of Normas relations  Again no said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I will explain myself further.",
    "Thank you.",
    "In actual fact I am employed by Miss Restaricks father Andrew Restarick.",
    "Ah.",
    "He has recently\nreturned to England I believe after many years absence.",
    "That is so.",
    "But you do not bring me a letter\nof introduction from him I did not ask him for one.",
    "Miss Battersby looked at him enquiringly.",
    "He might have insisted on coming with me said Hercule Poirot.",
    "That would have hampered me in\nasking you the questions that I wish to ask because it is likely that the answers to them might cause him\npain and distress.",
    "There is no reason why he should be caused further distress than he is already suffering\nat this moment.",
    "Has anything happened to Norma I hope not...",
    "There is however a possibility of\nthat.",
    "You remember the girl.",
    "Miss Battersby I remember all my pupils.",
    "I have an excellent memory.",
    "Meadowfield in any case is not a very large school.",
    "Two hundred girls no more.",
    "Why have you\nresigned from it.",
    "Miss Battersby Really M. Poirot I cannot see that that is any of your business.",
    "No\nI am merely expressing my quite natural curiosity.",
    "I am seventy.",
    "Is that not a reason Not in your\ncase I should say.",
    "You appear to me to be in full vigour and energy fully capable of continuing your\nheadmistressship for a good many years to come.",
    "Times change M. Poirot.",
    "One does not always like\nthe way they are changing.",
    "I will satisfy your curiosity.",
    "I found I was having less and less patience with parents.",
    "Their aims for their\ndaughters are shortsighted and quite frankly stupid.",
    "Miss Battersby was as Poirot knew from looking up\n\n\fher qualifications a very wellknown mathematician.",
    "Do not think that I lead an idle life said Miss Battersby.",
    "I lead a life where the work is far more\ncongenial to me.",
    "I coach senior students.",
    "And now please may I know the reason for your interest in the\ngirl Norma Restarick There is some occasion for anxiety.",
    "She has to put it baldly disappeared.",
    "Miss Battersby continued to look quite unconcerned.",
    "Indeed When you say disappeared I presume you mean that she has left home without telling her\nparents where she was going.",
    "Oh I believe her mother is dead so without telling her father where she\nwas going.",
    "That is really not at all uncommon nowadays M. Poirot.",
    "Mr. Restarick has not consulted the\npolice He is adamant on that subject.",
    "He refuses definitely.",
    "I can assure you that I have no\nknowledge as to where the girl is.",
    "I have heard nothing from her.",
    "Indeed I have had no news from her\nsince she left Meadowfield.",
    "So I fear I cannot help you in any way.",
    "It is not precisely that kind of\ninformation that I want.",
    "I want to know what kind of a girl she is  how you would describe her.",
    "Not her\npersonal appearance.",
    "I do not mean that.",
    "I mean as to her personality and characteristics.",
    "Norma at\nschool was a perfectly ordinary girl.",
    "Not scholastically brilliant but her work was adequate.",
    "Not a\nneurotic type Miss Battersby considered.",
    "Then she said slowly No I would not say so.",
    "Not more that is than might be expected considering her home circumstances.",
    "You mean her invalid\nmother Yes.",
    "She came from a broken home.",
    "The father to whom I think she was very devoted left home suddenly with another woman \u2014 a fact\nwhich her mother quite naturally resented.",
    "She probably upset the daughter more than she need have\ndone by voicing her resentment without restraint.",
    "Perhaps it may be more to the point if I ask you your\nopinion of the late Mrs.\nRestarick What you are asking for is my private opinion If you do not object No I have no\nhesitation at all in answering your question.",
    "Home conditions are very important in a girls life and I have\nalways studied them as much as I can through the meagre information that comes to me.",
    "Mrs. Restarick\nwas a worthy and upright woman I should say.",
    "Selfrighteous censorious and handicapped in life by\nbeing an extremely stupid one Ah said Poirot appreciatively.",
    "She was also I would say a malade iwaginaire.",
    "A type that would exaggerate her ailments.",
    "The type of\nwoman who is always in and out of nursing homes.",
    "An unfortunate home background for a girl especially a girl who has no very definite personality of her own.",
    "Norma had no marked intellectual\nambitions she had no confidence in herself she was not a girl to whom I would recommend a career.",
    "A\nnice ordinary job followed by marriage and children was what I would have hoped for her.",
    "You saw forgive me for asking  no signs at any time of mental instability Mental instability said Miss\nBattersby.",
    "Rubbish So that is what you say.",
    "Rubbish\nAnd not neurotic Any girl or almost any girl can be neurotic especially in adolescence and in her first\nencounters with the world.",
    "She is still immature and needs guidance in her first encounters with sex.",
    "Girls\nare frequently attracted to completely unsuitable sometimes even dangerous young men.",
    "There are it\nseems no parents nowadays or hardly any with the strength of character to save them from this so they\noften go through a time of hysterical misery and perhaps make an unsuitable marriage which ends not\nlong after in divorce.",
    "But Norma showed no signs of mental instability Poirot persisted with the\nquestion.",
    "She is an emotional but normal girl said Miss Battersby.",
    "Mental instability I As I said before rubbish Shes probably run away with some young man to get married and theres nothing more normal\nthan that\nCHAPTER TWENTYONE\nPOIROT sat in his big square armchair.",
    "His hands rested on the arms his eyes looked at the chimneypiece in front of him without seeing it.",
    "By\nhis elbow was a small table and on it neatly clipped together were various documents.",
    "Reports from Mr. Goby information obtained from his friend.",
    "Chief Inspector Neele a series of separate\npages under the heading of Hearsay gossip rumour and the sources from which it had been obtained.",
    "At the moment he had no need to consult these documents.",
    "He had in fact read them through carefully\nand laid them there in case there was any particular point he wished to refer to once more.",
    "He wanted\nnow to assemble together in his mind all that he knew and had learned because he was convinced that\nthese things must form a pattern.",
    "There must be a pattern there.",
    "He was considering now from what\nexact angle to approach it.",
    "He was not one to trust in enthusiasm for some particular intuition.",
    "He was not\nan intuitive person  but he did have feelings.",
    "The important thing was not the feelings themselves  but\nwhat might have caused them.",
    "It was the cause that was interesting the cause was so often not what you\nthought it was.",
    "You had often to work it out by logic by sense and by knowledge.",
    "What did he feel about this case  what kind of a case was it Let him start from the general then\nproceed to the particular.",
    "What were the salient facts of this case\nMoney was one of them he thought though he did not know how.",
    "Somehow or other money...",
    "He also\nthought increasingly so that there was evil somewhere.",
    "He knew evil.",
    "He had met it before.",
    "He knew the tang of it the taste of it the way it went.",
    "The trouble\nwas that here he did not yet know exactly where it was.",
    "He had taken certain steps to combat evil.",
    "He\nhoped they would be sufficient.",
    "Something was happening something was in progress that was not yet\naccomplished.",
    "Someone somewhere was in danger.",
    "The trouble was that the facts pointed both ways.",
    "If the person he thought was in danger was really in\ndanger there seemed so far as he could see no reason why.",
    "Why should that particular person be in\ndanger\nThere was no motive.",
    "If the person he thought was in danger was not in danger then the whole approach\nmight have to be completely reversed... Everything that pointed one way he must turn round and look at\nfrom the completely opposite point of view.",
    "He left that for the moment in the balance and he came from there to the personalities  to the people.",
    "What pattern did they make What part were they playing\nFirst  Andrew Restarick.",
    "He had accumulated by now a fair amount of information about Andrew\nRestarick.",
    "A general picture of his life before and after going abroad.",
    "A restless man never sticking to\n\n\fone place or purpose long but generally liked.",
    "Nothing of the wastrel about him nothing shoddy or\ntricky.",
    "Not perhaps a strong personality Weak in many ways\nPoirot frowned dissatisfied.",
    "That picture did not somehow fit the Andrew Restarick that he himself had\nmet.",
    "Not weak surely with that thrustout chin the steady eyes the air of resolution.",
    "He had been a\nsuccessful business man too apparently.",
    "Good at his job in the earlier years and he had put through good deals in South Africa and in South\nAmerica.",
    "He had increased his holdings.",
    "It was a success story that he had brought home with him not\none of failure.",
    "How then could he be a weak personality Weak perhaps only where women were\nconcerned.",
    "He had made a mistake in his marriagemarried the wrong woman...",
    "Pushed into it perhaps\nby his family And then he had met the other woman.",
    "Just that one woman Or had there been several\nwomen It was hard to find a record of that kind after so many years.",
    "Certainly he had not been a\nnotoriously unfaithful husband.",
    "He had had a normal home he had been fond by all accounts of his small\ndaughter.",
    "But then he had come across a woman whom he had cared for enough to leave his home and\nto leave his country.",
    "It had been a real love affair.",
    "But had it perhaps matched up with any additional motive Dislike of office work the City the daily\nroutine of London He thought it might.",
    "It matched the pattern.",
    "He seemed too to have been a solitary\ntype.",
    "Everyone had liked him both here and abroad but there seemed no intimate friends.",
    "Indeed it\nwould have been difficult for him to have intimate friends abroad because he had never stopped in any\none spot long enough.",
    "He had plunged into some gamble attempted a coup had made good then tired\nof the thing and gone on somewhere else.",
    "Nomadic I A wanderer.",
    "It still did not quite accord with his own picture of the man... A picture The word stirred in his mind the\nmemory of the picture that hung in Restaricks office on the wall behind his desk.",
    "It had been a portrait\nof the same man fifteen years ago.",
    "How much difference had those fifteen years made in the man sitting there\nSurprisingly little on the whole More grey in the hair a heavier set to the shoulders but the lines of\ncharacter on the face were much the same.",
    "A determined face.",
    "A man who knew what he wanted who\nmeant to get it.",
    "A man who would take risks.",
    "A man with a certain ruthlessness.",
    "Why he wondered had Restarick brought that picture up to London They had been companion\nportraits of a husband and wife.",
    "Strictly speaking artistically they should have remained together.",
    "Would\na psychologist have said that subconsciously Restarick wanted to dissociate himself from his former wife\nonce more to separate himself from her Was he then mentally still retreating from her personality\nalthough she was dead An interesting point.",
    "The pictures had presumably come out of storage with various other family articles of furnishing.",
    "Mary\nRestarick had no doubt selected certain personal objects to supplement the furniture of Crosshedges for\nwhich Sir Roderick had made room.",
    "He wondered whether Mary Restarick the new wife had liked\nhanging up that particular pair of portraits.",
    "More natural perhaps if she had put the first wifes portrait in\nan attic But then he reflected that she would probably not have had an attic to stow away unwanted\nobjects at Crosshedges.",
    "Presumably Sir Roderick had made room for a few family things whilst the\nreturned couple were looking about for a suitable house in London.",
    "So it had not mattered much and it\nwould have been easier to hang both portraits.",
    "Besides Mary Restarick seemed a sensible type of\nwoman not a jealous or emotional type.",
    "Tout de meme thought Hercule Poirot to himself les femmes they are all capable of jealousy and\n\n\fsometimes the ones you would consider the least likely His thoughts passed to Mary Restarick and he\nconsidered her in turn.",
    "It struck him that what was really odd was that he had so few thoughts about her\nHe had seen her only the once and she had somehow or other not made much impression on him.",
    "A\ncertain efficiency he thought and also a certainhow could he put it  artificiality But there my\nfriend said Hercule Poirot again in parenthesis there you are considering her wig It was absurd\nreally that one should know so little about a woman.",
    "A woman who was efficient and who wore a wig\nand who was goodlooking and who was sensible and who could feel anger.",
    "Yes she had been angry\nwhen she had found the Peacock Boy wandering uninvited in her house.",
    "She had displayed it sharply and\nunmistakably.",
    "And the boy  he had seemed what Amused no more.",
    "But she had been angry very\nangry at finding him there.",
    "Well that was natural enough.",
    "He would not be any mothers choice for her\ndaughter  Poirot stopped short in his thoughts shaking his head vexedly.",
    "Mary Restarick was not\nNormas mother.",
    "Not for her the agony the apprehension about a daughter making an unsuitable\nunhappy marriage or announcing an illegitimate baby with an unsuitable father What did Mary feel about\nNorma Presumably to begin with that she was a thoroughly tiresome girl  who had picked up with a\nyoung man who was going to be obviously a source of worry and annoyance to Andrew Restarick.",
    "But\nafter that What had she thought and felt about a stepdaughter who was apparently deliberately trying to\npoison her\nHer attitude seemed to have been the sensible one.",
    "She had wanted to get Norma out of the house\nherself out of danger and to cooperate with her husband in suppressing any scandal about what had\nhappened.",
    "Norma came down for an occasional weekend to keep up appearances but her life henceforward was\nbound to centre in London.",
    "Even when the Restaricks moved into the house they were looking for they\nwould not suggest Norma living with them.",
    "Most girls nowadays lived away from their families.",
    "So that\nproblem had been settled.",
    "Except that for Poirot the question of who had administered poison to Mary Restarick was very far\nfrom settled.",
    "Restarick himself believed it was his daughter \u2014 But Poirot wondered.",
    "His mind played with the possibilities of the girl Sonia.",
    "What was she doing in that house Why had she\ncome there She had Sir Roderick eating out of her hand all right \u2014 perhaps she had no wish to go back\nto her own country Possibly her designs were purely matrimonial \u2014 old men of Sir Rodericks age\nmarried pretty young girls every day of the week.",
    "In the worldly sense Sonia could do very well for\nherself.",
    "A secure social position and widowhood to look forward to with a settled and sufficient income \u2014 or\nwere her aims quite different Had she gone to Kew Gardens with Sir Rodericks missing papers tucked\nbetween the pages of a book\nHad Mary Restarick become suspicious of her \u2014 of her activities of her loyalties of where she went on\nher days off and of whom she met And had Sonia then administered the substances which in\ncumulative small doses would arouse no suspicion of anything but ordinary gastroenteritis\nFor the time being he put the household at Crosshedges out of his mind.",
    "He came as Norma had come to London and proceeded to the consideration of three girls who shared\na flat.",
    "Claudia ReeceHolland Frances Cary Norma Restarick.",
    "Claudia ReeceHolland daughter of a\nwellknown Member of Parliament well off capable well trained goodlooking a firstclass secretary.",
    "Frances Cary a country solicitors daughter artistic had been to drama school for a short time then to\nthe Slade chucked that also occasionally worked for the Arts Council now employed by an art gallery.",
    "Earned a good salary was artistic and had bohemian associations.",
    "She knew the young man David\nBaker though not apparently more than casually.",
    "Perhaps she was in love with him He was the kind of\nyoung man Poirot thought disliked generally by parents members of the Establishment and also the\npolice.",
    "Where the attraction lay for wellborn girls Poirot failed to see.",
    "But one had to acknowledge it as\na fact.",
    "What did he himself think of David\nA goodlooking boy with the impudent and slightly amused air whom he had first seen in the upper\nstories of Crosshedges doing an errand for Norma or reconnoitring on his own who could say.",
    "He\nhad seen him again when he gave him a lift in his car.",
    "A young man of personality giving indeed an\nimpression of ability in what he chose to do.",
    "And yet there was clearly an unsatisfactory side to him.",
    "Poirot picked up one of the papers on the table by his side and studied it.",
    "A bad record though not\npositively criminal.",
    "Small frauds on garages hooliganism smashing up things on probation twice.",
    "All\nthose things were the fashion of the day.",
    "They did not come under Poirots category of evil.",
    "He had been\na promising painter but had chucked it.",
    "He was the king that did no steady work.",
    "He was vain proud a peacock in love with his own appearance.",
    "Was he anything more than that Poirot\nwondered.",
    "He stretched out an arm and picked up a sheet of paper on which was scribbed down the rough heads of\nthe conversation held between Norma and David in the cafe that is as well as Mrs. Oliver could\nremember them.",
    "And how well was that Poirot thought He shook his head doubtfully.",
    "One never knew quite at what point Mrs. Olivers imagination would take over\nDid the boy care for Norma really want to marry her There was no doubt about her feelings for him.",
    "He had suggested marrying her.",
    "Had Norma got money of her own She was the daughter of a rich man\nbut that was not the same thing.",
    "Poirot made an exclamation of vexation.",
    "He had forgotten to enquire the\nterms of the late Mrs. Restaricks will.",
    "He flipped through the sheets of notes.",
    "No Mr. Goby had not\nneglected this obvious need.",
    "Mrs. Restarick apparently had been well provided for by her husband\nduring her lifetime.",
    "She had had apparently a small income of her own amounting perhaps to a thousand\na year.",
    "She had left everything she possessed to her daughter.",
    "It would hardly amount Poirot thought to a\nmotive for marriage.",
    "Probably as his only child she would inherit a lot of money at her fathers death but that was not at all\nthe same thing.",
    "Her father might leave her very little indeed if he disliked the man she had married.",
    "He would say then that David did care for her since he was willing to marry her.",
    "And yet  Poirot shook his head.",
    "It was about the fifth time he had shaken it.",
    "All these things did not tie\nup they did not make a satisfactory pattern.",
    "He remembered Restaricks desk and the cheque he had\nbeen writing  apparently to buy off the young man  and the young man apparently was quite willing\nto be bought off So that again did not tally.",
    "The cheque had certainly been made out to David Baker and\nit was for a very large  really a preposterous  sum.",
    "It was a sum that might have tempted any\n\n\fimpecunious young man of bad character.",
    "And yet he had suggested marriage to her only a day before.",
    "That of course might have been just a move in the game  a move to raise the price he was asking.",
    "Poirot remembered Restarick sitting there his lips hard.",
    "He must care a great deal for his daughter to be\nwilling to pay so high a sum and he must have been afraid too that the girl herself was quite determined\nto marry him.",
    "From thoughts of Restarick he went on to Claudia.",
    "Claudia and Andrew Restarick.",

    "Claudia.",
    "He considered her.",

    "Yes it always came back to that.",
    "The third girl.",
    "And that is where he had come in the end.",
    "Where he had had to come.",

    "He not only suspected  he was quite sure apparently that she had tried to poison his recently\nmarried wife.",
    "He had consulted a doctor about her.",
    "Poirot felt he would like dearly to talk to that doctor\nhimself but he doubted if he would get anywhere.",
    "Doctors were very chary of parting with medical information to anyone but a duly accredited person such\nas the parents.",
    "But Poirot could imagine fairly well what the doctor had said.",
    "He had been cautious\nPoirot thought as doctors are apt to be.",
    "Hed hemmed and hawed and spoken perhaps of medical treatment.",
    "He had not stressed too positively a\nmental angle but had certainly suggested it or hinted at it.",
    "In fact the doctor probably was privately sure that that was what had happened.",
    "But he also knew a\ngood deal about hysterical girls and that they sometimes did things that were not really the result of\nmental causes but merely of temper jealousy emotion and hysteria.",
    "He would not be a psychiatrist\nhimself nor a neurologist.",
    "He would be a G.P.",

    "She had shown no signs of wanting to turn the\ngirl out \u2014 which she might have done if she had been afraid of her mental condition.",
    "There could not\nhave been much discussion between her and Frances on the subject since the other girl had so innocently\nlet escape the fact that Norma had not returned to them after her weekend at home.",
    "Claudia had been\nannoyed about that.",
    "It was possible that Claudia was more in the pattern than she appeared.",

    "Was Ophelia mad or sane\nRestarick would not have used the word mad even in his thoughts about his daughter.",
    "Mentally\ndisturbed was the term that everyone preferred to use.",
    "The other word that had been used of Norma had\nbeen batty.",
    "Shes a bit batty.",

    "Where\ndaily women good judges Poirot thought they might be.",
    "There was something odd about Norma\ncertainly but she might be odd in a different way to what she seemed.",

    "A glimpse of a police\nstenographer on an excursion to the flat next door to take statements from Frances Cary and a mythical\nperson called Miss Jacobs.",
    "A coming and going of ordered business and a final departure of two men\nwith cameras.",
    "Then unexpectedly the sudden incursion into Claudias bedroom of a tall looselyjointed young man with\nred hair.",
    "Without taking any notice of Mrs.\nOliver he spoke to Poirot.",
    "Whats she done Murder Who is it\nThe boy friend Yes.",
    "She admits it It would seem so.",
    "Not good enough.",
    "Did she say so in\ndefinite words I have not heard her do so.",
    "I have had no chance of asking her anything myself.",
    "A\npoliceman looked in.",
    "Dr. Stillingfleet he asked.",
    "The police surgeon would like a word with you.",
    "Dr. Stillingfleet nodded\nand followed him out of the room.",
    "So thats Dr. Stillingfleet said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "She considered for a moment or two.",
    "Quite something isnt he\nCHAPTER TWENTYTHREE\nCHIEF INSPECTOR NEELE drew a sheet of paper towards him jotted one or two notes on it and\nlooked round at the other five people in the room.",
    "His voice was crisp and formal.",
    "Miss Jacobs he said.",
    "He looked towards the policeman who stood by the door.",
    "Sergeant Conolly I\nknow has taken her statement.",
    "But Id like to ask her a few questions myself.",
    "Miss Jacobs was ushered\ninto the room a few minutes later.",
    "Neele rose courteously to greet her.",
    "I am Chief Inspector Neele he said shaking hands with her.",
    "I am sorry to trouble you for a second\ntime.",
    "But this time it is quite informal I just want to get a clearer picture of exactly what you saw and\nheard.",
    "Im afraid it may be painful   Painful no said Miss Jacobs accepting the chair he offered her.",
    "It was a shock of course.",
    "But no emotions were involved.",
    "She added You seem to have tidied up\nthings.",
    "He presumed she was referring to the removal of the body.",
    "Her eyes both observant and critical passed lightly over the assembled people registering for Poirot\nfrank astonishment What on earth is this for Mrs. Oliver mild curiosity appraisement for the back of\nDr. Stillingfleets red head neighbourly recognition for Claudia to whom she vouchsafed a slight nod and\nfinally dawning sympathy for Andrew Restarick.",
    "You must be the girls father she said to him.",
    "Theres not much point to condolences from a total\nstranger.",
    "Theyre better left unsaid.",
    "Its a sad world we live in nowadays \u2014 or so it seems to me.",
    "Girls\nstudy too hard in my opinion.",
    "Then she turned her face composedly towards Neele.",
    "Yes I would like you.",
    "Miss Jacobs to tell me in your own words exactly what you saw and heard.",
    "I\nexpect it will vary from what I said before said Miss Jacobs unexpectedly.",
    "Things do you know.",
    "One tries to make ones description as accurate as possible and so one uses\nmore words.",
    "I dont think one is any more accurate I think unconsciously one adds things that you think\nyou may have seen or ought to have seen  or heard.",
    "But I will do my best.",
    "It started with screams.",
    "I was startled.",
    "I thought someone must have been hurt.",
    "So I was already coming to the door when someone began beating on it and still screaming.",
    "I opened it\nand saw it was one of my nextdoor neighbours  the three girls who live in 67.",
    "Im afraid I dont know\nher name though I know her by sight.",
    "Frances Cary said Claudia.",
    "She was quite incoherent and stammered out something about someone being dead  someone she\nknew  David Someone  I didnt catch his last name.",
    "She was sobbing and shaking all over.",
    "I brought\nher in gave her some brandy and went to see for myself.",
    "Everyone felt that throughout life that would\nbe what Miss Jacobs would invariably do.",
    "You know what I found.",
    "Need I describe it Just briefly perhaps.",
    "A young man one of these\nmodern young men  gaudy clothes and long hair.",
    "He was lying on the floor and he was clearly dead.",
    "His shirt was stiff with blood.",
    "Stillingfleet stirred.",
    "He\nturned his head and looked keenly at Miss Jacobs.",
    "Then I became aware that there was a girl in the room.",
    "She was holding a kitchen knife.",
    "She seemed\nquite calm and selfpossessed  really most peculiar.",
    "Stillingfleet said Did she say anything  She said\nshe had been into the bathroom to wash the blood off her hands  and then she said But you cant wash\nthings like that off can you  Out damned spot in fact I cannot say that she reminded me\nparticularly of Lady Macbeth.",
    "She was  how shall I put it  perfectly composed.",
    "She laid the knife down on the table and sat down on a chair.",
    "What else did she say asked Chief\nInspector Neele his eyes dropping to a scrawled note in front of him.",
    "Something about hate.",
    "That it wasnt safe to hate anybody.",
    "She said something about poor David\ndidnt she Or so you told Sergeant Conoily.",
    "And that she wanted to be free of him.",
    "Id forgotten that.",
    "Yes.",
    "She said something about his making her\ncome here  and something about Louise too.",
    "What did she say about Louise It was Poirot who\nasked leaning forward sharply.",
    "Miss Jacobs looked at him doubtfully.",
    "Nothing really just mentioned the name.",
    "Like Louise9 she said and then stopped.",
    "It was after she\nhad said about its not being safe to hate people... And then Then she told me quite calmly I had\nbetter ring up the police.",
    "Which I did.",
    "We just  sat there until they came...",
    "I did not think I ought to\nleave her.",
    "We did not say anything.",
    "She seemed absorbed in her thoughts and I  well frankly I\ncouldnt think of anything to say.",
    "You could see couldnt you that she was mentally unstable said\nAndrew Restarick.",
    "You could see that she didnt know what she had done or why poor child He\nspoke pleadingly  hopefully.",
    "If it is a sign of mental instability to appear perfectly cool and collected after committing a murder then I\nwill agree with you.",
    "Miss Jacobs spoke in the voice of one who quite decidedly did not agree.",
    "Stillingfleet said Miss Jacobs did she at any time admit that she had killed him Oh yes.",
    "I should have\nmentioned that before\u2014 It was the very first thing she did say.",
    "As though she was answering some\nquestion I had asked her.",
    "She said Yes Pve killed him.9 And then went on about having washed her\n\n\fhands.",
    "Restarick groaned and buried his face in his hands.",
    "Claudia put her hand on his arm.",
    "Poirot said Miss Jacobs you say the girl put down the knife she was carrying on that table.",
    "It was quite near you You saw it clearly\nDid it appear to you that the knife also had been washed Miss Jacobs looked hesitantly at Chief\nInspector Neele.",
    "It was clear that she felt that Poirot struck an alien and unofficial note in this presumably\nofficial enquiry.",
    "Perhaps you would be kind enough to answer that said Neele.",
    "No \u2014 I dont think the knife had been washed or wiped in any way.",
    "It was stained and discoloured with\nsome thick sticky substance.",
    "Ah Poirot leaned back in his chair.",
    "I should have thought you would have known all about the knife yourself said Miss Jacobs to Neele\naccusingly.",
    "Didnt your police examine it It seems to me very lax if they didnt.",
    "Oh yes the police\nexamined it said Neele.",
    "But we \u2014 er \u2014 always like to get corroboration.",
    "She darted him a shrewd\nglance.",
    "What you really mean I suppose is that you like to find out how accurate the observation of your\nwitnesses is.",
    "How much they make up or how much they actually see or think they have seen.",
    "He\nsmiled slightly as he said I dont think we need have doubts about you.",
    "Miss Jacobs.",
    "You will make an\nexcellent witness.",
    "I shant enjoy it.",
    "But its the kind of thing one has to go through with I suppose.",
    "Im\nafraid so.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Miss Jacobs.",
    "He looked round.",
    "No one has any additional questions Poirot\nindicated that he had.",
    "Miss Jacobs paused near the doorway displeased.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "About this mention of someone called Louise.",
    "Did you know who it was the girl meant How should I\nknow Isnt it possible that she might have meant Mrs. Louise Charpentier.",
    "You knew Mrs.\nCharpentier didnt you I did not.",
    "You knew that she recently threw herself out of a window in this\nblock of flats I knew that of course.",
    "I didnt know her Christian name was Louise and I was not\npersonally acquainted with her.",
    "Nor perhaps particularly wished to be I have not said so since the\nwoman is dead.",
    "But I will admit that that is quite true.",
    "She was a most undesirable tenant and I and other\nresidents have frequently complained to the management here.",
    "Of what exactly To speak frankly the\nwoman drank.",
    "Her flat was actually on the top floor above mine and there were continual disorderly parties with broken\nglass furniture knocked over singing and shouting a lot of\u2014 er \u2014 coming and going.",
    "She was\nperhaps a lonely woman suggested Poirot.",
    "That was hardly the impression she conveyed said Miss Jacobs acidly.",
    "It was put forward at the\ninquest that she was depressed over the state of her health.",
    "Entirely her own imagination.",
    "She seems to have had nothing the matter with her.",
    "And having disposed\nof the late Mrs.\nCharpentier without sympathy.",
    "Miss Jacobs took her departure.",
    "Poirot turned his attention to Andrew Restarick.",
    "He asked delicately Am I correct in thinking Mr.\n\n\fRestarick that you were at one time well acquainted with Mrs. Charpentier Restarick did not answer\nfor a moment or two.",
    "Then he sighed deeply and transferred his gaze to Poirot.",
    "Yes.",
    "At one time many years ago I knew her very well indeed... Not I may say under the name of\nCharpentier.",
    "She was Louise Birell when I knew her.",
    "You were \u2014 er \u2014 in love with her Yes I was\nin love with her... Head over ears in love with her I left my wife on her account.",
    "We went to South\nAfrica.",
    "After barely a year the whole thing blew up.",
    "She returned to England.",
    "I never heard from her again.",
    "I never even knew what had become of her.",
    "What about your daughter Did she also know Louise Birell Not to remember her surely.",
    "A child\nof five years old But did she know her Poirot persisted.",
    "Yes said Restarick slowly.",
    "She knew Louise.",
    "That is to say Louise came to our house.",
    "She used to\nplay with the child.",
    "So it is possible that the girl might remember her even after a lapse of years I\ndont know.",
    "I simply dont know.",
    "I dont know what she looked like how much Louise might have\nchanged.",
    "I never saw her again as I told you.",
    "Poirot said gently But you heard from her didnt you\nMr. Restarick I mean you have heard from her since your return to England Again there came that\npause and the deep unhappy sigh Yes  I heard from her... said Restarick.",
    "And then with sudden\ncuriosity he asked How did you know that M.\nPoirot From his pocket Poirot drew a neatly folded piece of paper.",
    "He unfolded it and handed it to\nRestarick.",
    "The latter looked at it with a faintly puzzled frown.",
    "Dear Andy I see from the papers youre home again.",
    "We must meet and compare notes as to what weve both been doing all these years  It broke off here\n and started again.",
    "Andy Guess who this is from Louise.",
    "Dont dare to say youve forgotten me I  Dear Andy As you will see by this letterhead Pm living in the\nsame block of flats as your secretary.",
    "What a small world it is We must meet.",
    "Could you come for a\ndrink Monday or Tuesday next week\nAndy darling I must see you again... Nobody has ever mattered to me but you  you haven91 really\nforgotten me either have you\nHow did you get this asked Restarick of Poirot tapping it curiously.",
    "From a friend of mine via a furniture van said Poirot with a glance at Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Restarick looked at her without favour.",
    "I couldnt help it said Mrs. Oliver interpreting his look correctly.",
    "I suppose it was her furniture being\nmoved out and the men let go of a desk and a drawer fell out and scattered a lot of things and the wind\n\n\fblew this along the courtyard so I picked it up and tried to give it back to them but they were cross and\ndidnt want it so I just put it in my coat pocket without thinking.",
    "And I never even looked at it until this\nafternoon when I was taking things out of pockets before sending the coat to the cleaners.",
    "So it really\nwasnt my fault.",
    "She paused slightly out of breath.",
    "Did she get her letter to you written in the end Poirot asked.",
    "Yes \u2014 she did \u2014 one of the more formal versions I didnt answer it.",
    "I thought it would be wiser not to\ndo so.",
    "You didnt want to see her again She was the last person I wanted to see She was a\nparticularly difficult woman  always had been.",
    "And Id heard things about her  for one that she had\nbecome a heavy drinker.",
    "And well  other things.",
    "Did you keep her letter to you No I tore it up I\nDr. Stillingfleet asked an abrupt question.",
    "Did your daughter ever speak about her to you Restarick seemed unwilling to answer.",
    "Dr. Stillingfleet urged him It might be significant if she did you know.",
    "You doctors Yes she did\nmention her once.",
    "What did she say exactly She said quite suddenly I saw Louise the other day.",
    "Father.",
    "I was startled.",
    "I said Where did you see her And she said In the restaurant of our flats.",
    "I was a bit embarrassed.",
    "I\nsaid I never dreamed youd remember her.",
    "And she said Ive never forgotten.",
    "Mother wouldnt have\nlet me forget even if I wanted to.",
    "Yes that could certainly be significant said Dr. Stillingfleet.",
    "And you.",
    "Mademoiselle said Poirot turning suddenly to Claudia.",
    "Did Norma ever speak to you about\nLouise Carpenter Yes  it was after the suicide.",
    "She said something about her being a wicked\nwoman.",
    "She said it in rather a childish way if you know what I mean.",
    "You were here in the flats yourself on the\nnightor more correctly the early morning when Mrs. Carpenters suicide occurred I was not here that\nnight no I was away from home.",
    "I remember arriving back here the next day and hearing about it.",
    "She\nhalf turned to Restarick... You remember It was the 23rd.",
    "I had gone to Liverpool.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "You were to represent me at the Hever Trust meeting.",
    "Poirot said But Norma slept here that night\nYes.",
    "Claudia seemed uncomfortable.",
    "Claudia Restarick laid his hand on her arm.",
    "What is it you know about Norma Theres something.",
    "Something that youre holding back.",
    "Nothing What should I know about her You think shes off her\nhead dont you said Dr. Stillingfleet in a conversational voice.",
    "And so does the girl with the black hair.",
    "And so do you.",
    "he added turning suddenly on Restarick.",
    "All of us behaving nicely and avoiding the\nsubject and thinking the same thing\nExcept that is the chief inspector.",
    "Hes not thinking anything.",
    "Hes collecting facts mad or a murderess.",
    "What about you.",
    "Madam Me Mrs. Oliver jumped.",
    "I  dont know.",
    "You reserve judgement I\ndont blame you.",
    "Its difficult.",
    "On the whole most people agree on what they think.",
    "They use different\nterms for it  thats all.",
    "Bats in the Belfry.",
    "Scatty.",
    "Wanting in the top storey.",
    "Off her onion.",
    "Mental\nDelusions.",
    "Does anyone think that girl is sane Miss Battersby said Poirot.",
    "Who the devil is Miss Battersby A schoolmistress.",
    "If I ever have a daughter I shall send her to that\nschool... Of course Im in a different category.",
    "I know.",
    "I know everything about that girl Normas father\nstared at him.",
    "Who is this man he demanded of Neele.",
    "What can he possibly mean by saying that he knows\neverything about my daughter I know about her said Stillingfleet because shes been under my\nprofessional care for the last ten days.",
    "Dr. Stillingfleet said Chief Inspector Neele is a highly qualified\nand reputable psychiatrist.",
    "And how did she come into your clutches  without someone getting my\nconsent first Ask Moustaches said Dr. Stillingfleet nodding to Poirot.",
    "Youyou... Restarick could hardly speak he was so angry.",
    "Poirot spoke placidly.",
    "I had your instructions.",
    "You wanted care and protection for your daughter when she was found.",
    "I found\nherand I was able to interest Dr. Stillingfleet in her case.",
    "She was in danger Mr. Restarick very grave danger.",
    "She could hardly be in any more danger than she\nis now Arrested on a charge of murder Technically she is not yet charged murmured Neele.",
    "He went on Dr. Stillingfleet do I understand that you are willing to give your professional opinion as to\nMiss Restaricks mental condition and as to how well she knows the nature and meaning of her acts\nWe can save the MNaughten act for court said Stillingfleet.",
    "What you want to know now is quite\nsimply if the girl is mad or sane All right Ill tell you.",
    "That girl is sane \u2014 as sane as any one or you\nsitting here in this room\nCHAPTER TWENTYFOUR\nTHEY stared at him.",
    "Didnt expect that did you Restarick said angrily Youre wrong.",
    "That girl doesnt even know what\nshes done.",
    "Shes innocent\u2014completely innocent.",
    "She cant be held responsible for what she doesnt\nknow shes done.",
    "You let me talk for a while.",
    "I know what Im talking about.",
    "You dont.",
    "That girl is\nsane and responsible for her actions.",
    "In a moment or two well have her in and let her speak for herself.",
    "Shes the only one who hasnt had the chance of speaking for herself Oh yes theyve got her here still \u2014\nlocked up with a police matron in her bedroom.",
    "But before we ask her a question or two Ive got\nsomething to say that youd better hear first.",
    "When that girl came to me she was full ofdrugs.",
    "And he gave them to her shouted Restarick.",
    "That\ndegenerate miserable boy.",
    "He started her on them no doubt.",
    "Thank God said Restarick.",
    "Thank\nGod for it.",
    "What are you thanking God for I misunderstood you.",
    "I thought you were going to throw\nher to the lions when you kept harping on her being sane.",
    "I misjudged you.",
    "It was the drugs that did it.",
    "Drugs that made her do things she would never have done of her own volition and left her with no\nknowledge of having done them.",
    "Stillingfleet raised his voice If you let me talk instead of talking so\nmuch yourself and being so sure you know all about everything we might get on a bit.",
    "First of all shes not an addict.",
    "There are no marks of injections.",
    "She didnt sniff snow.",
    "Someone or\nother perhaps the boy perhaps someone else was administering drugs to her without her knowledge.",
    "Not just a purple heart or two in the modern fashion.",
    "A rather interesting medley of drugs  L.S.D.",
    "giving vivid dream sequences  nightmares or pleasurable.",
    "Hemp distorting the time factor so that she might believe an experience has lasted an hour instead of a\nfew minutes.",
    "And a good many other curious substances that I have no intention of letting any of you\n\n\fknow about.",
    "Somebody who was clever with drugs played merry hell with that girl.",
    "Stimulants sedatives they all played their part in controlling her and showing her to herself as a\ncompletely different person.",
    "Restarick interrupted Thats what I say.",
    "Norma wasnt responsible\nSomeone was hypnotising her to do these things.",
    "You still havent got the point Nobody could make\nthe girl do what she didnt want to do What they could do was make her think she had done it.",
    "Now\nwell have her in and make her see whats been happening to her.",
    "He looked enquiringly at Chief\nInspector Neele who nodded.",
    "Stillingfleet spoke over his shoulder to Claudia as he went out of the sittingroom.",
    "Whered you put that\nother girl the one you took away from Jacobs gave a sedative to In her room on her bed Better shake\nher up a bit and drag her along somehow.",
    "Well need all the help we can get.",
    "Claudia also went out of the sittingroom.",
    "Stillingfleet came back propelling Norma and uttering rough encouragement.",
    "Theres a good gill... Nobodys going to bite you.",
    "Sit there.",
    "She sat obediently.",
    "Her docility was still\nrather frightening.",
    "The policewoman hovered by the door looking scandalised.",
    "All Im asking you to do is to speak the truth.",
    "It isnt nearly as difficult as you think.",
    "Claudia came in\nwith Frances Cary.",
    "Frances was yawning heavily.",
    "Her black hair hung like a curtain hiding half her mouth as she yawned and\nyawned again.",
    "You need a pickmeup said Stillingfleet to her.",
    "I wish youd all let me go to sleep murmured Frances indistinctly.",
    "Nobodys going to have a chance of sleep until Ive done with them Now Norma you answer my\nquestions That woman along the passage says you admitted to her that you killed David Baker.",
    "Is that right Her docile voice said Yes.",
    "I killed David.",
    "Stabbed him Yes.",
    "How do you know\nyou did She looked faintly puzzled.",
    "I dont know what you mean.",
    "He was there on the floor  dead.",
    "Where was the knife I picked it up.",
    "It had blood on it Yes.",
    "And on his shirt.",
    "What did it feel\nlike  the blood on the knife The blood that you got on your hand and had to wash off Wet Or more\nlike strawberry jam.",
    "It was like strawberry jam  sticky.",
    "She shivered.",
    "I had to go and wash it off my\nhands.",
    "Very sensible.",
    "Well that ties up everything very nicely.",
    "Victim murderyou  all complete with\nthe weapon.",
    "Do you remember actually doing it No...",
    "I dont remember that...",
    "But I must have done it\nmustnt I Dont ask me I wasnt there.",

    "But there was another\nkilling before that wasnt there\nAn earlier killing.",
    "You mean  Louise Yes.",
    "I mean Louise...",
    "When did you first think of killing her\nYears ago.",
    "Oh years ago.",
    "When you were a child.",
    "Yes.",
    "Had to wait a long time didnt you Id\nforgotten all about it.",
    "Until you saw her again and recognised her Yes.",
    "When you were a child you\nhated her.",
    "Why Because she took Father my father away.",
    "And made your mother unhappy Mother hated\n\n\fLouise.",
    "She said Louise was a really wicked woman.",
    "Talked to you about her a lot I suppose Yes.",
    "I wish she hadnt...",
    "I didnt want to go on hearing about her.",
    "Monotonous  I know.",
    "Hate isnt creative.",
    "When you saw her again did you really want to kill her Norma seemed to consider.",
    "A faintly interested\nlook came into her face.",
    "I didnt really you know...",
    "It seemed all so long ago.",
    "I couldnt imagine myself thats why   Why\nyou werent sure you had Yes.",
    "I had some quite wild idea that I hadnt killed her at all.",
    "That it had\nbeen all a dream.",
    "That perhaps she really had thrown herself out of the window.",
    "Well  why not\nBecause I knew I had done it  I said I had done it.",
    "You said you had done it Who did you say that\nto Norma shook her head.",
    "I mustnt.",
    "It was someone who tried to be kind  to help me.",
    "She said she was going to pretend to have known\nnothing about it.",
    "She went on the words coming fast and excitedly I was outside Louises door the\ndoor of 763 just coming out of it.",
    "I thought Id been walking in my sleep.",
    "They  she  said there had\nbeen an accident.",
    "Down in the courtyard.",
    "She kept telling me it had been nothing to do with me.",
    "Nobody\nwould ever know And I couldnt remember what I had done  but there was stuff in my hand  \nStuff What stuff Do you mean bloody No not bloodtorn curtain stuff.",
    "When Id pushed her out.",
    "You remember pushing her out do you No no.",

    "Thats why I hoped.",
    "Thats why I went \u2014  She turned her head towards\nPoirot \u2014 to him \u2014  She turned back again to Stillingfleet.",
    "I never remembered the things Id done none of them.",
    "But I got more and more frightened.",
    "Because\nthere used to be quite long times that were blank\u2014quite blank \u2014 hours I couldnt account for or\nremember where Id been and what Id been doing.",
    "But I found things \u2014 things I must have hidden away\nmyself.",
    "Mary was being poisoned by me they found out she was being poisoned at the hospital.",
    "And I found the weed killer Pd hidden away in the drawer.",
    "In the flat here there was a flickknife.",
    "And I\nhad a revolver that I didnt even know Id bought I did kill people but I didnt remember killing them so\nIm not really a murderer \u2014 Im just \u2014 mad I realised that at last.",
    "Im mad and I cant help it.",
    "People\ncant blame you if you do things when you are mad.",
    "If I could come here and even kill David it shows I\nam mad doesnt it Youd like to be mad very much yes I suppose so.",
    "If so why did you confess\nto someone that you had killed a woman by pushing her out of the window Who was it you told\nNorma turned her head hesitated.",
    "Then raised her hand and pointed.",
    "I told Claudia.",
    "That is absolutely untrue.",
    "Claudia looked at her scornfully.",
    "You never said anything of\nthe kind to me I did.",
    "I did.",
    "When Where I  dont know.",
    "She told me that she had confessed it\nall to you said Frances indistinctly.",
    "Frankly I thought she was hysterical and making the whole thing up.",
    "Stillingfleet looked across at\nPoirot.",

    "Claudia has left messages in every place we\ncan think of.",
    "By now she ought to have rung up at least from somewhere.",
    "Perhaps we have the wrong\nidea said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Perhaps Madame is at least partly here already  in a manner of speaking.",
    "What on earth do you mean shouted Restarick angrily.",
    "Might I trouble you chere Madame Poirot leaned towards Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver stared.",
    "The parcel I entrusted to you   Oh.",
    "Mrs. Oliver dived into her shopping bag.",

    "Mrs. Restarick is not here he said but her wig is.",
    "Interesting.",
    "Where the devil did you get that\nPoirot asked Neele.",

    "He had gone to Norma and taken her hand gently in his.",
    "Your ordeal is over my child.",
    "The victim will not be sacrificed.",
    "You are neither mad nor have you killed\nanyone.",
    "There are two cruel and heartless creatures who plotted against you with cunningly administered drugs\nwith lies doing their best to drive you either to suicide or to belief in your own guilt and madness.",

    "My father.",
    "My father He could think of doing that to me.",
    "His daughter.",
    "My father who loved me \u2014 \nNot your father mon enfant \u2014 a man who came here after your fathers death to impersonate him and\nlay hands on an enormous fortune.",

    "Her voice was accusatory.",
    "Poirot hastened to pour oil on troubled waters.",
    "But chere Madame consider.",
    "What I owe to you I can hardly express.",

    "I was not clever about her  No  I Hercule Poirot was not clever at all.",
    "Hear hear said Dr.\nStillingfleet.",
    "First time Ive ever heard you say that Poirot Wonders will never cease I dont really see why she\nwanted two personalities said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "It seems unnecessarily confusing.",
    "No.",
    "It was very\nvaluable to her.",
    "It gave her you see a perpetual alibi whenever she wanted it.",
    "To think that it was there\nall the time before my eyes and I did not see it\nThere was the wig  I kept being subconsciously worried by it but not seeing why I was worried.",

    "Always always I came back to that in my mind.",
    "Why had\nRestarick brought it up to his office What special significance did it have for him Enfin I do not admire\nmyself for being so dense.",
    "I dont understand about the picture It was a very clever idea.",
    "It served as\na kind of certificate of identity.",
    "A pair of portraits husband and wife by a celebrated and fashionable\nportrait painter of his day.",
    "David Baker when they come out of store replaces Restaricks portrait with one of Orwell making him\nabout twenty years younger in appearance.",
    "Nobody would have dreamed that the portrait was a fake\nthe style the brush strokes the canvas it was a splendidly convincing bit of work.",
    "Restarick hung it over\nhis desk.",
    "Anyone who knew Restarick years ago might say Id  hardly have known you Or Youve\nchanged quite a lot would look up at the portrait but would only think that he himself had really\nforgotten what the other man had looked like It was a great risk for Restarick \u2014 or rather Orwell \u2014\nto take said Mrs. Oliver thoughtfully.",
    "Less than you might think.",
    "He was never a claimant you see in the Tichborne sense.",
    "He was only a\nmember of a wellknown City firm returning home after his brothers death to settle up his brothers affairs\nafter having spent some years abroad.",
    "He brought with him a young wife recently acquired abroad and took up residence with an elderly half\nblind but extremely distinguished uncle by marriage who had never known him well after his schoolboy\ndays and who accepted him without question.",

    "She had met him it seems in Kenya about two years ago.",
    "They were both crooks though with entirely\ndifferent interests.",
    "He went in for various shoddy deals as a prospectorRestarick and Orwell went together to prospect\nfor mineral deposits in somewhat wild country.",
    "There was a rumour of Restaricks death probably true\nwhich was later contradicted.",
    "A lot of money in the gamble I suspect said Stillingfleet.",
    "An enormous amount of money was involved.",
    "A terrific gamble  for a terrific stake.",
    "It came off.",
    "Andrew Restarick was a very rich man himself and he was his brothers heir.",
    "Nobody questioned his\nidentity.",
    "And then \u2014 things went wrong.",
    "Out of the blue he got a letter from a woman who if she ever came face to face with him would know\nat once that he wasnt Andrew Restarick.",
    "And a second piece of bad fortune occurred \u2014 David Baker\nstarted to blackmail him.",
    "That might have been expected I suppose said Stillingfleet thoughtfully.",
    "They didnt expect it said Poirot.",
    "David had never blackmailed before.",
    "It was the enormous wealth of this man that went to his head I\nexpect.",
    "The sum he had been paid for faking the portrait seemed to him grossly inadequate.",
    "He wanted\nmore.",
    "So Restarick wrote him large cheques and pretended that it was on account of his daughter \u2014 to\nprevent her from making an undesirable marriage.",
    "Whether he really wanted to marry her I do not know\n\u2014 he may have done.",
    "But to blackmail two people like Orwell and Frances Cary was a dangerous thing\nto do.",
    "You mean those two just coldbloodedly planned to kill two people \u2014 quite calmly  just like\nthat demanded Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She looked rather sick.",
    "They might have added you to their list Madame said Poirot.",
    "Me Do you mean that it was one of them who hit me on the head Frances I suppose Not the poor\nPeacock I do not think it was the Peacock.",
    "But you had been already to Borodene Mansions.",
    "Now\nyou perhaps follow Frances to Chelsea or so she thinks with a rather dubious story to account for\nyourself.",
    "So she slips out and gives you a nice little tap on the head to put paid to your curiosity for a while.",
    "You\nwould not listen when I warned you there was danger about.",
    "I can hardly believe it of her Lying about\nin attitudes of a BurneJones heroine in that dirty studio that day.",
    "But why   She looked at\nNormathen back at Poirot.",
    "They used her  deliberately  worked upon her drugged her made her\nbelieve that she had murdered two people.",
    "Why They wanted a victim... said Poirot.",
    "He rose from his chair and went to Norma.",
    "Mon enfant you have been through a terrible ordeal.",
    "It is a thing that need never happen to you again.",
    "Remember that now you can have confidence in yourself always.",
    "To have known at close quarters what absolute evil means is to be armoured against what life can do\nto you.",
    "I suppose you are right said Norma.",
    "To think you are mad \u2014 really to believe it is a frightening thing... She shivered.",
    "I dont see even now why I escaped \u2014 why anyone managed to believe that I hadnt killed\nDavid\u2014not when even  believed I had killed him Blood was wrong said Dr. Stillingfleet in a\nmatteroffact tone.",
    "Starting to coagulate.",
    "Shirt was stiff with it as Miss Jacobs said not wet.",
    "You\nwere supposed to have killed him not more than about five minutes before Francess screaming act.",
    "How did she \u2014  Mrs. Oliver began to work things out.",
    "She had been to Manchester \u2014  She came\nhome by an earlier train changed into her Mary wig and madeup on the train.",
    "Walked into Borodene\nMansions and went up in the lift as an unknown blonde.",
    "Went into the flat where David was waiting for\nher as she had told him to do.",
    "He was quite unsuspecting and she stabbed him.",
    "Then she went out\nagain and kept watch until she saw Norma coming.",
    "She slipped into a public cloakroom changed her\nappearance and joined a friend at the end of the road and walked with her said goodbye to her at\nBorodene Mansions and went up herself and did her stuff  quite enjoying doing it I expect.",
    "By the time the police had been called and got there she didnt think anyone would suspect the time lag.",
    "I\n\n\fmust say Norma you gave us all a hell of a time that day.",
    "Insisting on having killed everyone the way you did I wanted to confess and get it all over... Did you did you think I might really have done it then Me What do you take me for I know what my\npatients will do or wont do.",
    "But I thought you were going to make things damned difficult.",
    "I didnt know\nhow far Neele was sticking his neck out.",
    "Didnt seem proper police procedure to me.",
    "Look at the way\nhe gave Poirot here his head.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "Chief Inspector Neele and I have known each other for many years.",
    "Besides he had been making\nenquiries about certain matters already.",
    "You were never really outside Louises door.",
    "Frances changed\nthe numbers.",
    "She reversed the 6 and the 7 on your own door.",
    "Those numbers were loose stuck on with\nspikes.",
    "Claudia was away that night.",
    "Frances drugged you so that the whole thing was a nightmare dream\nto you.",
    "I saw the truth suddenly.",
    "The only other person who could have killed Louise was the real third\ngirl Frances Gary.",
    "You kept half recognising her you know said Stillingfleet when you described to\nme how one person seemed to turn into another.",
    "Norma looked at him thoughtfully.",
    "You were very rude to people she said to Stillingfleet.",
    "He looked slightly taken aback.",
    "Rude The things you said to everyone.",
    "The way you shouted at them.",
    "Oh well yes perhaps I was...\nIve got in the way of it.",
    "People are so damned irritating.",
    "He grinned suddenly at Poirot.",
    "Shes quite a girl isnt she Mrs. Oliver rose to her feet with a sigh.",
    "I must go home.",
    "She looked at the two men and then at Norma.",
    "What are we going to do with her\nshe asked.",
    "They both looked startled.",
    "c know shes staying with me at the moment she went on.",
    "And she says shes quite happy.",
    "But I\nmean there it is quite a problem.",
    "Lots and lots of money because your father \u2014 the real one I mean \u2014\nleft it all to you.",
    "And that will cause complications and begging letters and all that.",
    "She could go and live\nwith old Sir Roderick but that wouldnt be much fun for a girl \u2014 hes pretty deaf already as well as blind\n\u2014 and completely selfish.",
    "By the way what about his missing papers and the girl and Kew Gardens\nThey turned up where he thought hed already looked \u2014 Sonia found them said Norma and added\nUncle Roddy and Sonia are getting married \u2014 next week \u2014  No fool like an old fool said\nStillingfleet.",
    "Aha said Poirot.",
    "So the young lady prefers life in England to being embroiled in la politique.",
    "She is\nperhaps wise that little one.",
    "So thats that said Mrs. Oliver with finality.",
    "But to go on about Norma\none has to be practical.",
    "Ones got to make plans.",
    "The girl cant know what she wants to do all by herself.",
    "Shes waiting for someone to tell her.",
    "She looked at them severely.",
    "Poirot said nothing.",
    "He smiled.",
    "Oh her said Dr. Stillingfleet.",
    "Well Ill tell you Norma.",
    "Im flying to Australia Tuesday week.",
    "I want\nto look around first \u2014 see if whats been fixed up for me is going to work and all that.",
    "Then Ill cable\nyou and you can join me.",
    "Then we get married.",
    "Youll have to take my word for it that its not your\nmoney I want.",
    "Im not one of those doctors who want to endow whacking great research establishments\nand all that.",
    "Im just interested in people.",
    "I think too that youd be able to manage me all right.",
    "All that\nabout my being rude to people \u2014 I hadnt noticed it myself.",
    "Its odd really when you think of all the mess youve been in \u2014 helpless as a fly in treacle\u2014yet its not\ngoing to be me running you its going to be you running me.",
    "Norma stood quite still.",
    "She looked at John\nStillingfleet very carefully as though she was considering something that she knew from an entirely\ndifferent point of view.",
    "And then she smiled.",
    "It was a very nice smile  like a happy young nannie.",
    "All right she said.",
    "She crossed the room to Hercule Poirot.",
    "was rude too she said.",
    "The day I came here when you were having breakfast.",
    "I said to you that you were too old to help me.",
    "That was a rude thing to say.",
    "And it wasnt true..  She\nput her hands on his shoulders and kissed him.",
    "Youd better get us a taxi she said to Stillingfleet.",
    "Dr. Stillingfleet nodded and left the room.",
    "Mrs. Oliver collected a handbag and a fur stole and Norma\nslipped on a coat and followed her to the door.",
    "Madamey un petit moment   Mrs. Oliver turned.",
    "Poirot had collected from the recesses of the sofa a\nhandsome coil of grey hair.",
    "Mrs. Oliver exclaimed vexedly Its ust like everything that they make nowadays no good at all\nHairpins I mean.",
    "They just slip out and everything falls.",
    "She went out frowning.",
    "A moment or two later she poked her head round the door again.",
    "She spoke in a conspiratorial whisper\nJust tell me\u2014its all right Ive sent her on down \u2014 did you send that girl to this particular doctor on\npurpose\nOf course I did.",
    "His qualifications are \u2014  Never mind his qualifications.",
    "You know what I mean.",
    "He\nand she \u2014 Did you If you must know yes.",
    "I thought so said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You do think of things dont you.",
