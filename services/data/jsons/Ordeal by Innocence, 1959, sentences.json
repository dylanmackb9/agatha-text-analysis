    "Job\n\n\fOne\n\nI\n\nIt was dusk when he came to the Ferry.",
    "He could have been there much earlier.",
    "The truth was he had put it\noff as long as he could.",
    "First his luncheon with friends in Redquay the light desultory\nconversation the interchange of gossip about mutual friends\u2014all that\nhad meant only that he was inwardly shrinking from what he had to do.",
    "His friends had invited him to stay on for tea and he had accepted.",
    "But at\nlast the time had come when he knew that he could put things off no\nlonger.",
    "The car he had hired was waiting.",
    "He said goodbye and left to drive\nthe seven miles along the crowded coast road and then inland down the\nwooded lane that ended at the little stone quay on the river.",
    "There was a large bell there which his driver rang vigorously to\nsummon the ferry from the far side.",
    "\u201cYou won\u2019t be wanting me to wait sir\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Arthur Calgary.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve ordered a car to meet me over there\nin an hour\u2019s time\u2014to take me to Drymouth.\u201d\nThe man received his fare and tip.",
    "He said peering across the river in\nthe gloom\n\u201cFerry\u2019s coming now sir.\u201d\nWith a softspoken good night he reversed the car and drove away up\nthe hill.",
    "Arthur Calgary was left alone waiting on the quayside.",
    "Alone\nwith his thoughts and his apprehension of what was in front of him.",
    "How\nwild the scenery was here he thought.",
    "One could fancy oneself on a\n\n\fScottish loch far from anywhere.",
    "And yet only a few miles away were\nthe hotels the shops the cocktail bars and the crowds of Redquay.",
    "He\nreflected not for the first time on the extraordinary contrasts of the\nEnglish landscape.",
    "He heard the soft plash of the oars as the ferry boat drew in to the\nside of the little quay.",
    "Arthur Calgary walked down the sloping ramp and\ngot into the boat as the ferryman steadied it with a boathook.",
    "He was an\nold man and gave Calgary the fanciful impression that he and his boat\nbelonged together were one and indivisible.",
    "A little cold wind came rustling up from the sea as they pushed off.",
    "\u201c \u2019Tis chilly this evening\u201d said the ferryman.",
    "Calgary replied suitably.",
    "He further agreed that it was colder than\nyesterday.",
    "He was conscious or thought he was conscious of a veiled curiosity\nin the ferryman\u2019s eyes.",
    "Here was a stranger.",
    "And a stranger after the\nclose of the tourist season proper.",
    "Moreover this stranger was crossing at\nan unusual hour\u2014too late for tea at the caf\u00e9 by the pier.",
    "He had no\nluggage so he could not be coming to stay.",
    "Why Calgary wondered had\nhe come so late in the day Was it really because subconsciously he had\nbeen putting this moment off Leaving as late as possible the thing that\nhad to be done Crossing the Rubicon\u2014the river \u2026 the river \u2026 his\nmind went back to that other river\u2014the Thames.",
    "He had stared at it unseeingly was it only yesterday then turned to\nlook again at the man facing him across the table.",
    "Those thoughtful eyes\nwith something in them that he had not quite been able to understand.",
    "A\nreserve something that was being thought but not expressed\u2026.",
    "\u201cI suppose\u201d he thought \u201cthey learn never to show what they are\nthinking.\u201d\nThe whole thing was pretty frightful when one came right down to it.",
    "He must do what had to be done\u2014and after that\u2014forget\nHe frowned as he remembered the conversation yesterday.",
    "That\npleasant quiet noncommittal voice saying\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite determined on your course of action Dr. Calgary\u201d\nHe had answered hotly\n\u201cWhat else can I do Surely you see that You must agree It\u2019s a\nthing I can\u2019t possibly shirk.\u201d\nBut he hadn\u2019t understood the look in those withdrawn grey eyes and\nhad been faintly perplexed by the answer.",
    "\u201cOne has to look all around a subject\u2014consider it from all aspects.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cSurely there can be only one aspect from the point of view of\njustice\u201d\nHe had spoken hotly thinking for a moment that this was an ignoble\nsuggestion of \u201chushing up\u201d the matter.",
    "\u201cIn a way yes.",
    "But there\u2019s more to it than that you know.",
    "More than\n\u2014shall we say\u2014justice\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree.",
    "There\u2019s the family to consider.\u201d\nAnd the other had said quickly \u201cQuite\u2014oh yes\u2014quite.",
    "I was\nthinking of them.\u201d\nWhich seemed to Calgary nonsense Because if one were thinking of\nthem\u2014\nBut immediately the other man had said his pleasant voice\nunchanged\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely up to you Dr. Calgary.",
    "You must of course do exactly\nas you feel you have to do.\u201d\nThe boat grounded on the beach.",
    "He had crossed the Rubicon.",
    "The ferryman\u2019s soft West Country voice said\n\u201cThat will be fourpence sir or do you want a return\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d Calgary said.",
    "\u201cThere will be no return.\u201d How fateful the\nwords sounded\nHe paid.",
    "Then he asked\n\u201cDo you know a house called Sunny Point\u201d\nImmediately the curiosity ceased to be veiled.",
    "The interest in the old\nman\u2019s eyes leaped up avidly.",
    "\u201cWhy surely.",
    "\u2019Tis there up along to your right\u2014you can just see it\nthrough them trees.",
    "You go up the hill and along the road to the right\nand then take the new road through the building estate.",

    "He didn\u2019t want to discuss the\nmatter.",
    "\u201cSunny Point.\u201d\nA slow and rather peculiar smile twisted the ferryman\u2019s lips.",
    "He\nlooked suddenly like an ancient sly faun.",
    "\u201cIt was her called the house that\u2014in the war.",
    "It were a new house of\ncourse only just been built\u2014hadn\u2019t got a name.",
    "But the ground \u2019tis built\non\u2014that wooded spit\u2014Viper\u2019s Point that is But Viper\u2019s Point wouldn\u2019t\ndo for her\u2014not for the name of her house.",
    "Called it Sunny Point she\ndid.",
    "But Viper\u2019s Point\u2019s what we allus call it.\u201d\n\n\fCalgary thanked him brusquely said good evening and started up the\nhill.",
    "Everyone seemed to be inside their houses but he had the fancy that\nunseen eyes were peering through the windows of the cottages all\nwatching him with the knowledge of where he was going.",
    "Saying to each\nother \u201cHe\u2019s going to Viper\u2019s Point\u2026.\u201d\nViper\u2019s Point.",
    "What a horrible apposite name that must have\nseemed\u2026.",
    "For sharper than a serpent\u2019s tooth\u2026.",
    "He checked his thoughts brusquely.",
    "He must pull himself together\nand make up his mind exactly what he was going to say\u2026.",
    "II\nCalgary came to the end of the nice new road with the nice new houses\non either side of it each with its eighth of an acre of garden rock plants\nchrysanthemums roses salvias geraniums each owner displaying his or\nher individual garden taste.",
    "At the end of the road was a gate with sunny point in Gothic letters\non it.",
    "He opened the gate passed through and went along a short drive.",
    "The house was there ahead of him a wellbuilt characterless modern\nhouse gabled and porched.",
    "It might have stood on any goodclass\nsuburban site or a new development anywhere.",
    "It was unworthy in\nCalgary\u2019s opinion of its view.",
    "For the view was magnificent.",
    "The river\nhere curved sharply round the point almost turning back on itself.",
    "Wooded hills rose opposite upstream to the left was a further bend of\nthe river with meadows and orchards in the distance.",
    "Calgary looked for a moment up and down the river.",
    "One should\nhave built a castle here he thought an impossible ridiculous fairy tale\ncastle The sort of castle that might be made of gingerbread or of frosted\nsugar.",
    "Instead there was good taste restraint moderation plenty of\nmoney and absolutely no imagination.",
    "For that naturally one did not blame the Argyles.",
    "They had only\nbought the house not built it.",
    "Still they or one of them Mrs. Argyle\nhad chosen it\u2026.",
    "He said to himself \u201cYou can\u2019t put it off any longer \u2026\u201d and pressed\nthe electric bell beside the door.",
    "He stood there waiting.",
    "After a decent interval he pressed the bell\nagain.",
    "He heard no footsteps inside but without warning the door swung\nsuddenly open.",
    "He moved back a step startled.",
    "To his already overstimulated\nimagination it seemed as though Tragedy herself stood there barring his\nway.",
    "It was a young face indeed it was in the poignancy of its youth that\ntragedy had its very essence.",
    "The Tragic Mask he thought should\nalways be a mask of youth \u2026 Helpless foreordained with doom\napproaching \u2026 from the future\u2026.",
    "Rallying himself he thought rationalizing \u201cIrish type.\u201d The deep\nblue of the eyes the dark shadow round them the upspringing black hair\nthe mournful beauty of the bones of the skull and cheekbones\u2014\nThe girl stood there young watchful and hostile.",
    "She said\n\u201cYes What do you want\u201d\nHe replied conventionally.",
    "\u201cIs Mr. Argyle in\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "But he doesn\u2019t see people.",
    "I mean people he doesn\u2019t know.",
    "He\ndoesn\u2019t know you does he\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "He doesn\u2019t know me but\u2014\u201d\nShe began to close the door.",
    "\u201cThen you\u2019d better write\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I particularly want to see him.",
    "Are you\u2014Miss\nArgyle\u201d\nShe admitted it grudgingly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m Hester Argyle yes.",
    "But my father doesn\u2019t see people\u2014not\nwithout an appointment.",
    "You\u2019d better write.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve come a long way \u2026\u201d She was unmoved.",
    "\u201cThey all say that.",
    "But I thought this kind of thing had stopped at\nlast.\u201d She went on accusingly \u201cYou\u2019re a reporter I suppose\u201d\n\u201cNo no nothing of the sort.\u201d\nShe eyed him suspiciously as though she did not believe him.",
    "\u201cWell what do you want then\u201d\nBehind her some way back in the hall he saw another face.",
    "A flat\nhomely face.",
    "Describing it he would have called it a face like a pancake\nthe face of a middleaged woman with frizzy yellowish grey hair\nplastered on top of her head.",
    "She seemed to hover waiting like a\nwatchful dragon.",
    "\u201cIt concerns your brother Miss Argyle.\u201d\nHester Argyle drew in her breath sharply.",
    "She said without belief\n\u201cMichael\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNo your brother Jack.\u201d\nShe burst out \u201cI knew it I knew you\u2019d come about Jacko Why can\u2019t\nyou leave us in peace It\u2019s all over and finished with.",
    "Why go on about\nit\u201d\n\u201cYou can never really say that anything is finished.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is finished Jacko is dead.",
    "Why can\u2019t you let him be All\nthat\u2019s over.",
    "If you\u2019re not a journalist I suppose you\u2019re a doctor or a\npsychologist or something.",
    "Please go away.",
    "My father can\u2019t be\ndisturbed.",
    "He\u2019s busy.\u201d\nShe began to close the door.",
    "In a hurry Calgary did what he ought to\nhave done at first pulled out the letter from his pocket and thrust it\ntowards her.",
    "\u201cI have a letter here\u2014from Mr. Marshall.\u201d\nShe was taken aback.",
    "Her fingers closed doubtfully on the envelope.",
    "She said uncertainly\n\u201cFrom Mr. Marshall\u2014in London\u201d\nShe was joined now suddenly by the middleaged woman who had\nbeen lurking in the recesses of the hall.",
    "She peered at Calgary\nsuspiciously and he was reminded of foreign convents.",
    "Of course this\nshould have been a nun\u2019s face It demanded the crisp white coif or\nwhatever you called it framed tightly round the face and the black habit\nand veil.",
    "It was the face not of a contemplative but of the laysister who\npeers at you suspiciously through the little opening in the thick door\nbefore grudgingly admitting you and taking you to the visiting parlour\nor to Reverend Mother.",
    "She said \u201cYou come from Mr. Marshall\u201d\nShe made it almost an accusation.",
    "Hester was staring down at the envelope in her hand.",
    "Then without a\nword she turned and ran up the stairs.",
    "Calgary remained on the doorstep sustaining the accusing and\nsuspicious glance of the dragoncumlaysister.",
    "He cast about for something to say but he could not think of\nanything.",
    "Prudently therefore he remained silent.",
    "Presently Hester\u2019s voice cool and aloof floated down to them.",
    "\u201cFather says he\u2019s to come up.\u201d\nSomewhat unwillingly his watchdog moved aside.",
    "Her expression of\nsuspicion did not alter.",
    "He passed her laid his hat on a chair and\nmounted the stairs to where Hester stood waiting for him.",
    "The inside of the house struck him as vaguely hygienic.",
    "It could\nalmost he thought have been an expensive nursing home.",
    "Hester led him along a passage and down three steps.",
    "Then she threw\nopen a door and gestured to him to pass through it.",
    "She came in behind\nhim closing the door after her.",
    "The room was a library and Calgary raised his head with a sense of\npleasure.",
    "The atmosphere of this room was quite different from the rest\nof the house.",
    "This was a room where a man lived where he both worked\nand took his ease.",
    "The walls were lined with books the chairs were\nlarge rather shabby but easeful.",
    "There was a pleasant disorder of papers\non the desk of books lying about on tables.",
    "He had a momentary\nglimpse of a young woman who was leaving the room by a door at the\nfar end rather an attractive young woman.",
    "Then his attention was taken\nby the man who rose and came to greet him the open letter in his hand.",
    "Calgary\u2019s first impression of Leo Argyle was that he was so\nattenuated so transparent as hardly to be there at all.",
    "A wraith of a man\nHis voice when he spoke was pleasant though lacking in resonance.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Calgary\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDo sit down.\u201d\nCalgary sat.",
    "He accepted a cigarette.",
    "His host sat down opposite him.",
    "All was done without hurry as though in a world where time meant very\nlittle.",
    "There was a faint gentle smile on Leo Argyle\u2019s face as he spoke\ntapping the letter gently with a bloodless finger as he did so.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Marshall writes that you have an important communication to\nmake to us though he doesn\u2019t specify its nature.\u201d His smile deepened as\nhe added \u201cLawyers are always so careful not to commit themselves\naren\u2019t they\u201d\nIt occurred to Calgary with a faint shock of surprise that this man\nconfronting him was a happy man.",
    "Not buoyantly or zestfully happy as\nis the normal way of happiness\u2014but happy in some shadowy but\nsatisfactory retreat of his own.",
    "This was a man on whom the outer world\ndid not impinge and who was contented that this should be so.",
    "He did not\nknow why he should be surprised by this\u2014but he was.",
    "Calgary said\n\u201cIt is very kind of you to see me.\u201d The words were a mere\nmechanical introduction.",
    "\u201cI thought it better to come in person than to\nwrite.\u201d He paused\u2014then said in a sudden rush of agitation \u201cIt is difficult\n\u2014very difficult\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cDo take your time.\u201d\nLeo Argyle was still polite and remote.",
    "He leaned forward in his gentle way he was obviously trying to help.",
    "\u201cSince you bring this letter from Marshall I presume that your visit\nhas to do with my unfortunate son Jacko\u2014Jack I mean\u2014Jacko was our\n\n\fown name for him.\u201d\nAll Calgary\u2019s carefully prepared words and phrases had deserted him.",
    "He sat here faced with the appalling reality of what he had to tell.",
    "He\nstammered again.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s so terribly difficult\u2026.\u201d\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence and then Leo said cautiously\n\u201cIf it helps you\u2014we\u2019re quite aware that Jacko was\u2014hardly a normal\npersonality.",
    "Nothing that you have to tell us will be likely to surprise us.",
    "Terrible as the tragedy was I have been fully convinced all along that\nJacko was not really responsible for his actions.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he wasn\u2019t.\u201d It was Hester and Calgary started at the\nsound of her voice.",
    "He had momentarily forgotten about her.",
    "She had sat\ndown on the arm of a chair just behind his left shoulder.",
    "As he turned his\nhead she leaned forward eagerly towards him.",
    "\u201cJacko was always awful\u201d she said confidentially.",
    "\u201cHe was just the\nsame as a little boy\u2014when he lost his temper I mean.",
    "Just caught up\nanything he could find and\u2014and went for you\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cHester\u2014Hester\u2014my dear.\u201d Argyle\u2019s voice was distressed.",
    "Startled the girl\u2019s hand flew to her lips.",
    "She flushed and spoke with\nthe sudden awkwardness of youth.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014I forgot\u2014I\u2014I oughtn\u2019t to\nhave said a thing like that\u2014not now that he\u2019s\u2014I mean now that it\u2019s all\nover and \u2026 and\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cOver and done with\u201d said Argyle.",
    "\u201cAll of this is in the past.",
    "I try\u2014\nwe all try\u2014to feel that the boy must be regarded as an invalid.",
    "One of\nNature\u2019s misfits.",
    "That I think expresses it best.\u201d He looked at Calgary.",
    "\u201cYou agree\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Calgary.",
    "There was a moment\u2019s silence.",
    "The sharp negative had taken both his\nlisteners aback.",
    "It had come out with almost explosive force.",
    "Trying to\nmitigate its effect he said awkwardly\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry.",
    "You see you don\u2019t understand yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d Argyle seemed to consider.",
    "Then he turned his head towards\nhis daughter.",
    "\u201cHester I think perhaps you\u2019d better leave us\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going away I\u2019ve got to hear\u2014to know what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be unpleasant\u2014\u201d\nHester cried out impatiently\n\u201cWhat does it matter what other awful things Jacko may have done\nThat\u2019s all over.\u201d\nCalgary spoke quickly.",
    "\u201cPlease believe me\u2014there is no question of anything that your\nbrother has done\u2014quite the opposite.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d\nThe door at the far end of the room opened and the young woman\nwhom Calgary had just glimpsed earlier came back into the room.",
    "She\nwore an outdoor coat now and carried a small attach\u00e9case.",
    "She spoke to Argyle.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going now.",
    "Is there anything else\u2014\u201d\nThere was a momentary hesitation on Argyle\u2019s part he would always\nhesitate Calgary thought and then he laid a hand on her arm and drew\nher forward.",
    "\u201cSit down Gwenda\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis is\u2014er\u2014Dr.",
    "Calgary.",
    "This is\nMiss Vaughan who is who is\u2014\u201d Again he paused as though in doubt.",
    "\u201cWho has been my secretary for some years now.\u201d He added \u201cDr.",
    "Calgary has come to tell us something\u2014or\u2014ask us something\u2014about\nJacko\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTo tell you something\u201d Calgary interrupted.",
    "\u201cAnd although you\ndon\u2019t realize it every moment you are making it more difficult for me.\u201d\nThey all looked at him in some surprise but in Gwenda Vaughan\u2019s\neyes he saw a flicker of something that looked like comprehension.",
    "It\nwas as though he and she were momentarily in alliance as though she\nhad said \u201cYes\u2014I know how difficult the Argyles can be.\u201d\nShe was an attractive young woman he thought though not so very\nyoung\u2014perhaps thirtyseven or eight.",
    "A wellrounded figure dark hair\nand eyes a general air of vitality and good health.",
    "She gave the\nimpression of being both competent and intelligent.",
    "Argyle said with a frosty touch in his manner \u201cI am not at all aware\nof making things difficult for you Dr. Calgary.",
    "Such was certainly not\nmy intention.",
    "If you will come to the point\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes I know.",
    "Forgive me for saying what I did.",
    "But it is the\npersistence with which you\u2014and your daughter\u2014are continually\nunderlining that things are now over\u2014done with\u2014finished.",
    "They are not\nover.",
    "Who is it who said \u2018Nothing is ever settled until\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Until it is settled right\u2019\u201d Miss Vaughan finished for him.",
    "\u201cKipling.\u201d\nShe nodded at him encouragingly.",
    "He felt grateful to her.",
    "\u201cBut I\u2019ll come to the point\u201d Calgary went on.",
    "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve heard\nwhat I have to say you\u2019ll understand my\u2014my reluctance.",
    "More my\ndistress.",
    "To begin with I must mention a few things about myself.",
    "I am a\n\n\fgeophysicist and have recently formed part of an Antarctic expedition.",
    "I\nonly returned to England a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\u201cThe Hayes Bentley Expedition\u201d asked Gwenda.",
    "He turned towards her gratefully.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "It was the Hayes Bentley Expedition.",

    "He insisted that he had a perfect alibi\nfor the time of the murder which was placed by the police at between\nseven and seventhirty.",
    "At that time Jack Argyle said he was\nhitchhiking into Drymouth having been picked up by a car on the main\nroad from Redmyn to Drymouth about a mile from here just before\nseven.",
    "He didn\u2019t know the make of the car it was dark by then but it\nwas a black or dark blue saloon driven by a middleaged man.",
    "Every\neffort was made to trace this car and the man who drove it but no\nconfirmation of his statement could be obtained and the lawyers\nthemselves were quite convinced that it was a story hastily fabricated by\nthe boy and not very cleverly fabricated at that\u2026.",
    "\u201cAt the trial the main line of defence was the evidence of\npsychologists who sought to prove that Jack Argyle had always been\nmentally unstable.",

    "Though very old and inclined\nto wander in her mind she recognized me and was very pleased to see\nme and quite excited because she had read in the papers about my\n\u2018going to the Pole\u2019 as she put it.",
    "I stayed only a short time so as not to\ntire her and on leaving decided not to return direct to Drymouth along\nthe coast road as I had come but instead to go north to Redmyn and see\nold Canon Peasmarsh who has some very rare books in his library\nincluding an early treatise on navigation from which I was anxious to\ncopy a passage.",
    "The old gentleman refuses to have the telephone which\nhe regards as a device of the devil and on a par with radio television\ncinema organs and jet planes so I had to take a chance of finding him at\nhome.",

    "But things didn\u2019t turn out as I anticipated.",
    "Not at all.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps Mr. Marshall you anticipated something of what would\nhappen Your manner I remember puzzled me when I was here before.",

    "\u201cVery well then\u201d said Arthur Calgary impatiently.",
    "\u201cCall it fanciful if\nyou like.",
    "But my feelings my conscience are still involved.",

    "The facts are very\nsimple Dr. Calgary.",
    "They are not confidential.",
    "They were made public at\nthe time.",
    "It resolves itself very simply into this.",
    "If Jack Argyle did not\nand by your account he cannot have committed the crime then who\ndid That brings us back to the circumstances in which the crime was\ncommitted.",
    "It was committed between the hours of seven and seven\n\n\fthirty on a November evening in a house where the deceased woman was\nsurrounded by the members of her own family and household.",
    "The house\nwas securely locked and shuttered and if anyone entered from outside\nthen the outsider must have been admitted by Mrs. Argyle herself or\nhave entered with their own key.",
    "In other words it must have been\nsomeone she knew.",
    "It resembles in some ways the conditions of the\nBorden case in America where Mr. Borden and his wife were struck\ndown by blows of an axe on a Sunday morning.",
    "Nobody in the house\nheard anything nobody was known or seen to approach the house.",
    "You\ncan see Dr. Calgary why the members of the family were as you put it\ndisturbed rather than relieved by the news you brought them\u201d\nCalgary said slowly \u201cThey\u2019d rather you mean that Jack Argyle was\nguilty\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u201d said Marshall.",
    "\u201cOh yes very decidedly so.",
    "If I may put it\nin a somewhat cynical way Jack Argyle was the perfect answer to the\nunpleasant fact of murder in the family.",
    "He had been a problem child a\ndelinquent boy a man of violent temper.",
    "Excuses could be and were\nmade for him within the family circle.",
    "They could mourn for him have\nsympathy with him declare to themselves to each other and to the\nworld that it was not really his fault that psychologists could explain it\nall Yes very very convenient.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now\u2014\u201d Calgary stopped.",
    "\u201cAnd now\u201d said Mr. Marshall \u201cit is different of course.",
    "Quite\ndifferent.",
    "Almost alarming perhaps.\u201d\nCalgary said shrewdly \u201cThe news I brought was unwelcome to you\ntoo wasn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cI must admit that.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I must admit that I was\u2014upset.",
    "A case\nwhich was closed satisfactorily\u2014yes I shall continue to use the word\nsatisfactorily\u2014is now reopened.\u201d\n\u201cIs that official\u201d Calgary asked.",
    "\u201cI mean\u2014from the police point of\nview will the case be reopened\u201d\n\u201cOh undoubtedly\u201d said Marshall.",
    "\u201cWhen Jack Argyle was found\nguilty on overwhelming evidence\u2014the jury was only out a quarter of an\nhour\u2014that was an end of the matter as far as the police were concerned.",
    "But now with the grant of a free pardon posthumously awarded the case\nis opened again.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the police will make fresh investigations\u201d\n\u201cAlmost certainly I should say.",
    "Of course\u201d added Marshall rubbing\nhis chin thoughtfully \u201cit is doubtful after this lapse of time owing to the\npeculiar features of the case whether they will be able to achieve any\n\n\fresult \u2026 For myself I should doubt it.",
    "They may know that someone in\nthe house is guilty.",
    "They may get so far as to have a very shrewd idea of\nwho that someone is.",
    "But to get definite evidence will not be easy.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cI see \u2026 Yes that\u2019s what she meant.\u201d\nThe lawyer said sharply \u201cOf whom are you speaking\u201d\n\u201cThe girl\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cHester Argyle.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes.",
    "Young Hester.\u201d He asked curiously \u201cWhat did she say to\nyou\u201d\n\u201cShe spoke of the innocent\u201d said Calgary.",

    "\u201cI think possibly you do.\u201d\n\u201cShe meant just what you are saying\u201d said Arthur Calgary.",
    "\u201cShe\nmeant that once more the family would be under suspicion\u2014\u201d\nMarshall interrupted.",

    "If one of the\nfamily was guilty it is possible that they themselves would not know\nwhich one.",
    "They would look at each other and\u2014wonder \u2026 Yes that\u2019s\nwhat would be the worst of all.",
    "They themselves would not know\nwhich\u2026.\u201d\nThere was silence.",
    "Marshall watched Calgary with a quiet appraising\nglance but he said nothing.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s terrible you know \u2026\u201d said Calgary.",
    "His thin sensitive face showed the play of emotion on it.",
    "\u201cYes that\u2019s terrible \u2026 To go on year after year not knowing looking\nat one another perhaps the suspicion affecting one\u2019s relationships with\npeople.",

    "I think perhaps if you\u2019ll\nexcuse me Mr. Marshall I see this more clearly than you do.",
    "I can\nimagine you see what it might mean.\u201d\nAgain there was silence.",
    "\u201cIt means\u201d said Calgary \u201cthat it is the innocent who are going to\nsuffer \u2026 And the innocent should not suffer.",
    "Only the guilty.",

    "It was\nin doing the latter that she met Leo Argyle who was an Oxford Don\nwith a great interest in economics and social reform.",
    "To understand Mrs.\nArgyle you have to realize that the great tragedy of her life was that she\nwas unable to have children.",
    "As is the case with many women this\ndisability gradually overshadowed the whole of her life.",
    "When after\nvisits to all kinds of specialists it seemed clear that she could never hope\nto be a mother she had to find what alleviation she could.",

    "Mrs. Argyle devoted herself almost entirely to charities\nconnected with children.",
    "On the outbreak of war in 1939 she established\nunder the auspices of the Ministry of Health a kind of war nursery for\nchildren purchasing the house you visited Sunny Point.\u201d\n\u201cThen called Viper\u2019s Point\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Yes I believe that was the original name.",

    "Everything was done for these children.",

    "She paid no\nattention to me.",

    "As a child he often\nhurled himself on another child or hit him with some heavy toy or bit of\nwood.",

    "By now he had grown so far away so aloof in some cold misty\nregion of his own that it was not in him to object.",
    "He said as he had said\nso many times\n\u201cYou must do as you please Rachel.\u201d\nShe had been full of triumph full of happiness making her plans\nconsulting solicitors going about things in her usual businesslike way.",

    "Only it\nhadn\u2019t worked out quite the way it was supposed to do \u2026 For these\nchildren were not the children that he and Rachel would have had.",
    "Within them ran none of the blood of Rachel\u2019s hardworking thrifty\nforebears none of the drive and ambition by which the less reputable\nmembers of her family had gained their assured place in society none of\nthe vague kindliness and integrity of mind that he remembered in his\nown father and grandfather and grandmother.",

    "Perhaps Leo thought they had been too soft with him.",
    "But no.",
    "Soft or\nhard in Jacko\u2019s case he thought the end would have been the same.",
    "What he wanted he must have.",

    "How remote all the past seemed to him.",
    "All those long years of the war with the boys and girls growing up.",

    "Only in Gwenda\u2019s\ncase that warmth that warmheartedness that enthusiasm were all for\nhim.",
    "Not for the hypothetical children that she might one day have just\nfor him.",
    "It had been like warming one\u2019s hands at a fire \u2026 Hands that\nwere cold and stiff with disuse.",
    "When had he first realized that she cared\nfor him It was difficult to say.",

    "Said she wouldn\u2019t be coming.",
    "Said there had\nbeen news of a peculiarly upsetting type.\u201d\n\u201cAh.",

    "\u201cShe\u2019s not yet twenty\nis she\u201d\n\u201cBut why is she so upset I tell you Mac she\u2019s scared stiff of\nsomething.\u201d\n\u201cM\u2019m yes well\u2014yes that might be so I suppose\u201d said MacMaster.",
    "\u201cDo you think\u2014what do you think\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more to the point\u201d MacMaster pointed out \u201cwhat you are\nthinking.\u201d\nThe young man said bitterly\n\u201cI suppose if I wasn\u2019t a doctor I shouldn\u2019t even begin to think such\nthings.",
    "She\u2019d be my girl and my girl could do no wrong.",

    "\u201cThat\u2019s the way we put it nowadays.\u201d\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t had time yet to get properly integrated.",
    "She was\nsuffering at the time of the murder from a perfectly natural feeling of an\nadolescent young woman\u2014resentment of authority\u2014an attempt to\nescape from smotherlove which is responsible for so much harm\nnowadays.",
    "She wanted to rebel to get away.",
    "She\u2019s told me all this\nherself.",
    "She ran away and joined a fourthclass touring theatrical\ncompany.",
    "Under the circumstances I think her mother behaved very\nreasonably.",
    "She suggested that Hester should go to London and go to\nRADA and study acting properly if she wanted to do so.",
    "But that wasn\u2019t\nwhat Hester wanted to do.",
    "This running away to act was just a gesture\nreally.",
    "She didn\u2019t really want to train for the stage or to take up the\nprofession seriously.",
    "She just wanted to show she could be on her own.",
    "Anyway the Argyles didn\u2019t try to coerce her.",
    "They gave her a quite\nhandsome allowance.\u201d\n\u201cWhich was very clever of them\u201d said MacMaster.",
    "\u201cAnd then she had this silly love affair with a middleaged member\nof the company.",
    "In the end she realized for herself that he was no good.",
    "Mrs. Argyle came along and dealt with him and Hester came home.\u201d\n\u201cHaving learnt her lesson as they used to say in my young days\u201d\nsaid MacMaster.",

    "Hester didn\u2019t.\u201d\nDonald Craig went on anxiously\n\u201cShe was full still of pentup resentment all the worse because she\nhad to acknowledge secretly if not openly that her mother had been\nperfectly right that she was no good as an actress and that the man she\n\n\fhad lavished her affections on wasn\u2019t worth it.",
    "And that anyway she\ndidn\u2019t really care for him.",
    "\u2018Mother knows best.\u2019 It\u2019s always galling to the\nyoung.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said MacMaster.",
    "\u201cThat was one of poor Mrs. Argyle\u2019s\ntroubles though she\u2019d never have thought of it like that.",
    "The fact was\nshe was nearly always right that she did know best.",
    "If she\u2019d been one of\nthose women who run into debt lose their keys miss trains and do\nfoolish actions that other people have to help them out of her entire\nfamily would have been much fonder of her.",
    "Sad and cruel but there\u2019s\nlife for you.",
    "And she wasn\u2019t a clever enough woman to get her own way\nby guile.",
    "She was complacent you know.",
    "Pleased with her own power\nand judgment and quite quite sure of herself.",
    "That\u2019s a very difficult thing\nto come up against when you\u2019re young.\u201d\n\u201cOh I know\u201d said Donald Craig.",
    "\u201cI realize all that.",
    "It\u2019s because I\nrealize it so well that I feel\u2014that I wonder\u2014\u201d He stopped.",
    "MacMaster said gently\n\u201cI\u2019d better say it for you hadn\u2019t I Don You\u2019re afraid that it was\nyour Hester who heard the quarrel between her mother and Jacko who\ngot worked up by hearing it perhaps and who in a fit of rebellion\nagainst authority and against her mother\u2019s superior assumption of\nomniscience went into that room picked up the poker and killed her.",
    "That\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid of isn\u2019t it\u201d\nThe young man nodded miserably.",
    "\u201cNot really.",
    "I don\u2019t believe it but\u2014but I feel\u2014I feel that it could\nhave happened.",
    "I don\u2019t feel Hester has got the poise the balance to\u2014I\nfeel she\u2019s young for her age uncertain of herself liable to have\nbrainstorms.",
    "I look at that household and I don\u2019t feel that any of them are\nlikely to have done such a thing until I come to Hester.",
    "And then\u2014then\nI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Dr. MacMaster.",
    "\u201cYes I see.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really blame her\u201d said Don Craig quickly.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think the\npoor child really knew what she was doing.",
    "I can\u2019t call it murder.",
    "It was\njust an act of emotional defiance of rebellion of a longing to be free of\nthe conviction that she would never be free until\u2014until her mother\nwasn\u2019t there any longer.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that last is probably true enough\u201d said MacMaster.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the\nonly kind of motive there is and it\u2019s rather a peculiar one.",
    "Not the kind\nthat looks strong in the eyes of the law.",
    "Wishing to be free.",
    "Free from the\nimpact of a stronger personality.",
    "Just because none of them inherits a\nlarge sum of money on the death of Mrs. Argyle the law won\u2019t consider\n\n\fthat they had a motive.",
    "But even the financial control I should imagine\nwas very largely in Mrs. Argyle\u2019s hands through her influence with the\nTrustees.",
    "Oh yes her death set them free all right.",
    "Not only Hester my\nboy.",
    "It set Leo free to marry another woman.",
    "It set Mary free to look\nafter her husband in the way she liked it set Micky free to live his own\nlife in the way he cared about living it.",

    "I think what you\u2019ve imagined is not farfetched and has an\nelement of probability about it.",

    "I\u2019ll\nlook after her.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s as well Superintendent Huish can\u2019t hear you\u201d said MacMaster\ndryly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m a lawabiding citizen as a rule\u201d said Donald \u201cbut you know\nvery well yourself Mac how they treat psychological evidence in the\nlaw courts.",
    "In my view it was a bad accident not a case of coldblooded\nmurder or even hotblooded murder for that matter.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re in love with the girl\u201d said MacMaster.",

    "In my day if it happened to me and I was in love with\nthe girl I should probably be convinced she was innocent.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the guilt or innocence that matters as that I\u2019ve got\nto know.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd if she did kill her mother you\u2019re quite prepared to marry her\nand live happily ever afterwards as they say\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you believe it\u201d said MacMaster.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll be wondering if the\nbitter taste in your coffee is only coffee and thinking that the poker in the\ngrate is a bit too hefty a size.",
    "And she\u2019ll see you thinking it.",
    "It won\u2019t\ndo\u2026.\u201d\n\n\fTen\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Marshall that you\u2019ll appreciate my reasons for asking you to\ncome here and have this conference.\u201d\n\u201cYes certainly\u201d said Mr. Marshall.",
    "\u201cThe fact is that if you had not\nproposed it Mr. Argyle I should myself have suggested coming down.",

    "\u201cQuite so it was only to be expected I feel.",
    "I should advise that you\ntake up the position that you have no comment to make.",
    "Naturally you\nare delighted and thankful but you prefer not to discuss the matter.\u201d\n\u201cSuperintendent Huish who was in charge of the case at the time\nhas asked to come and have an interview with us tomorrow morning\u201d\nsaid Leo.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Yes I\u2019m afraid there will have to be a certain amount of\nreopening of the case though I really cannot think that the police can\nhave much hope of arriving at any tangible result.",
    "After all two years\nhave passed and anything that people might have remembered at the time\n\u2014people in the village I mean\u2014will by now have been forgotten.",
    "A\npity of course in some ways but it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole thing seems quite clear\u201d said Mary Durrant.",
    "\u201cThe house\nwas securely locked up against burglars but if anyone had come\nappealing to my mother over some special case or pretending to be a\nfriend or friends of hers I have no doubt that person would have been\nadmitted.",
    "That I think is what must have happened.",
    "My father here\nthought he heard a ring at the bell just after seven o\u2019clock.\u201d\nMarshall turned his head enquiringly to Leo.",
    "\u201cYes I think I did say so\u201d said Leo.",
    "\u201cOf course I can\u2019t remember\nvery clearly now but at the time I was under the impression that I heard\n\n\fthe bell.",
    "I was ready to go down and then I thought I heard the door open\nand close.",
    "There was no sound of voices or any question of anyone\nforcing an entry or behaving abusively.",
    "That I think I should have\nheard.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so quite so\u201d said Mr. Marshall.",
    "\u201cYes I think there\u2019s no doubt\nthat that is what must have happened.",
    "Alas we know only too well the\nlarge number of unprincipled persons gaining admission to a house by a\nplausible tale of distress and who having gained admission are willing to\ncosh the householder and make off with what money they can find.",
    "Yes\nI think that we must assume now that that is what did happen.\u201d\nHe spoke in too persuasive a voice.",
    "He looked round the little\nassembly as he spoke noting them carefully and labelling them in his\nmeticulous mind.",
    "Mary Durrant goodlooking unimaginative\nuntroubled even slightly aloof apparently quite sure of herself.",
    "Behind\nher in his wheelchair her husband.",
    "An intelligent fellow Philip Durrant\nMarshall thought to himself.",
    "A man who might have done a good deal\nand gone far had it not been for his unreliable judgment in all matters of\nbusiness.",
    "He was not Marshall thought taking all this as calmly as his\nwife was.",
    "His eyes were alert and thoughtful.",
    "He realized none better\nthe implications of the whole matter.",
    "Of course though Mary Durrant\nmight not be as calm as she appeared to be.",
    "Both as a girl and a woman\nshe had always been able to conceal her feelings.",
    "As Philip Durrant moved slightly in his chair his bright intelligent\neyes watching the lawyer with a faint mockery in them Mary turned her\nhead sharply.",
    "The complete adoration of the look she gave her husband\nalmost startled the lawyer.",
    "He had known of course that Mary Durrant\nwas a devoted wife but he had so long considered her as a calm rather\npassionless creature without strong affections or dislikes that he was\nsurprised at this sudden revelation.",
    "So that was how she felt about the\nfellow was it As for Philip Durrant he seemed uneasy.",
    "Apprehensive\nMarshall thought about the future.",
    "As well he might be\nOpposite the lawyer sat Micky.",
    "Young handsome bitter.",
    "Why had he\ngot to be so bitter Marshall thought parenthetically Hadn\u2019t everything\nbeen done for him always Why did he have to have this look of one\nwho was perpetually against the world.",
    "Beside him sat Tina looking\nrather like a small elegant black cat.",
    "Very dark softvoiced big dark\neyes and a rather sinuous grace of movement.",
    "Quiet yet perhaps\nemotional behind the quietness Marshall really knew very little about\nTina.",
    "She had taken up the work suggested to her by Mrs. Argyle as a\nlibrarian in the County Library.",
    "She had a flat in Redmyn and came\n\n\fhome at weekends.",
    "Apparently a docile and contented member of the\nfamily.",
    "But who knew Anyway she was out of it or ought to be.",
    "She\nhad not been here that evening.",
    "Though for all that Redmyn was only\ntwentyfive miles away.",
    "Still presumably Tina and Micky had been out\nof it.",
    "Marshall swept a quick glance over Kirsten Lindstrom who was\nwatching him with a touch of belligerence in her manner.",
    "Supposing he\nthought it was she who had gone berserk and attacked her employer It\nwouldn\u2019t really surprise him.",
    "Nothing really surprised you when you\u2019d\nbeen in the law a number of years.",
    "They\u2019d have a word for it in the\nmodern jargon.",
    "Repressed spinster.",
    "Envious jealous nursing grievances\nreal or fancied.",
    "Oh yes they had a word for it.",
    "And how very convenient\nit would be thought Mr. Marshall rather improperly.",
    "Yes very\nconvenient.",
    "A foreigner.",
    "Not one of the family.",
    "But would Kirsten\nLindstrom have deliberately framed Jacko have heard the quarrel and\ntaken advantage of it That was a great deal more difficult to believe.",
    "For\nKirsten Lindstrom adored Jacko.",
    "She had always been devoted to all the\nchildren.",
    "No he could not believe that of her.",
    "A pity because\u2014but really\nhe must not let his thoughts go along that line.",
    "His glance went on to Leo Argyle and Gwenda Vaughan.",
    "Their\nengagement had not been announced which was just as well.",
    "A wise\ndecision.",
    "He had actually written and hinted as much.",
    "Of course it was\nprobably an open secret locally and no doubt the police were on to it.",
    "From the point of view of the police it was the right kind of answer.",
    "Innumerable precedents.",
    "Husband wife and the other woman.",
    "Only\nsomehow or other Marshall could not believe that Leo Argyle had\nattacked his wife.",
    "No he really couldn\u2019t believe it.",
    "After all he had\nknown Leo Argyle for a number of years and he had the highest opinion\nof him.",
    "An intellectual.",
    "A man of warm sympathies deep reading and an\naloof philosophical outlook upon life.",
    "Not the sort of man to murder his\nwife with a poker.",
    "Of course at a certain age when a man fell in love\u2014\nbut no That was newspaper stuff.",
    "Pleasant reading apparently for\nSundays all over the British Isles But really one could not imagine\nLeo\u2026.",
    "What about the woman He didn\u2019t know so much about Gwenda\nVaughan.",
    "He observed the full lips and the ripe figure.",
    "She was in love\nwith Leo all right.",
    "Oh yes probably been in love with him for a long\ntime.",
    "What about a divorce he wondered.",
    "What would Mrs. Argyle have\nfelt about divorce Really he had no idea but he didn\u2019t think the idea\nwould appeal to Leo Argyle who was one of the oldfashioned type.",
    "He\n\n\fdidn\u2019t think that Gwenda Vaughan was Leo Argyle\u2019s mistress which\nmade it all the more probable that if Gwenda Vaughan had seen a chance\nto eliminate Mrs. Argyle with the certainty that no suspicion would\nattach to her\u2014he paused before continuing the thought.",
    "Would she have\nsacrificed Jacko without a qualm He didn\u2019t really think she had ever\nbeen very fond of Jacko.",
    "Jacko\u2019s charm had not appealed to her.",
    "And\nwomen\u2014Mr.",
    "Marshall knew only too well\u2014were ruthless.",
    "So one\ncouldn\u2019t rule out Gwenda Vaughan.",
    "It was very doubtful after this time if\nthe police would ever get any evidence.",
    "He didn\u2019t see what evidence\nthere could be against her.",
    "She had been in the house that day she had\nbeen with Leo in his library she had said good night to him and left him\nand gone down the stairs.",
    "There was no one who could say whether or\nnot she had gone aside into Mrs. Argyle\u2019s sitting room picked up that\npoker and walked up behind the unsuspecting woman as she bent over\npapers on the desk.",
    "And then afterwards Mrs. Argyle having been struck\ndown without a cry all Gwenda Vaughan had to do was to throw down\nthe poker and let herself out of the front door and go home just as she\nalways did.",
    "He couldn\u2019t see any possibility of the police or anyone else\nfinding out if that was what she had done.",
    "His eyes went on to Hester.",
    "A pretty child.",
    "No not pretty beautiful\nreally.",
    "Beautiful in a rather strange and uncomfortable way.",
    "He\u2019d like to\nknow who her parents had been.",
    "Something lawless and wild about her.",
    "Yes one could almost use the word desperate in connection with her.",
    "What had she had to be desperate about She\u2019d run away in a silly way\nto go on the stage and had had a silly affair with an undesirable man\nthen she had seen reason come home with Mrs. Argyle and settled down\nagain.",
    "All the same you couldn\u2019t really rule out Hester because you\ndidn\u2019t know how her mind worked.",
    "You didn\u2019t know what a strange\nmoment of desperation might do to her.",
    "But the police wouldn\u2019t know\neither.",
    "In fact thought Mr. Marshall it seemed very unlikely that the police\neven if they made up their own minds as to who was responsible could\nreally do anything about it.",
    "So that on the whole the position was\nsatisfactory.",
    "Satisfactory He gave a little start as he considered the\nword.",
    "But was it Was stalemate really a satisfactory outcome to the\nwhole thing Did the Argyles know the truth themselves he wondered.",
    "He decided against that.",
    "They didn\u2019t know.",
    "Apart of course from one\nperson amongst them who presumably knew only too well \u2026 No they\ndidn\u2019t know but did they suspect Well if they didn\u2019t suspect now they\nsoon would because if you didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t help wondering\n\n\ftrying to remember things \u2026 Uncomfortable.",

    "\u201cThat\u2019s what you advise.",
    "Yes.",

    "No good ever came of\ntalking too much when you\u2019re in a tight place.",
    "And we are in a tight\nplace.\u201d\n\u201cSo nobody\u2019s going to have any opinions are they\u201d said Micky.",
    "\u201cAll right.",
    "So be it.",
    "But let\u2019s all think about it a bit when we go up to bed\ntonight.",
    "It might be advisable you know.",
    "After all one wants to know\nwhere one is so to speak.",
    "Don\u2019t you know a thing or two Kirsty You\n\n\fusually do.",
    "As far as I remember you always knew what was going on\nthough I will say for you you never told.\u201d\nKirsten Lindstrom said not without dignity\n\u201cI think Micky that you should hold your tongue.",
    "Mr. Marshall is\nright.",
    "Too much talking is unwise.\u201d\n\u201cWe might put it to the vote\u201d said Micky.",
    "\u201cOr write a name on a\npiece of paper and throw it into a hat.",
    "That would be interesting\nwouldn\u2019t it to see who got the votes\u201d\nThis time Kirsten Lindstrom\u2019s voice was louder.",
    "\u201cBe quiet\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cDo not be a silly reckless little boy as you used\nto be.",
    "You are grown up now.\u201d\n\u201cI only said let\u2019s think about it\u201d said Micky taken aback.",
    "We shall think about it\u201d said Kirsten Lindstrom.",
    "And her voice was bitter.",

    "He amused himself sometimes by\nforecasting the reactions of those around him to suitable stimuli.",
    "What he\nsaid and did was often not a natural outpouring but a calculated one\nmotivated simply and solely to observe the response to it.",
    "It was a kind\nof game that he played when he got the anticipated response he chalked\nup as it were a mark to himself.",

    "Now since his illness cut\nhim off from his former active life he was forced to take account of\nwhat people themselves were like.",
    "It had started in the hospital when the love lives of the nurses the\nsecret warfare and the petty grievances of hospital life had been forced\non his attention since there was nothing else to occupy it.",

    "Then had come his\nillness.",

    "She was just\ngoing out herself.",

    "\u201cI knew Mrs. Argyle was busy and\ndidn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d\nHester said in an aggrieved voice\n\u201cWhat does it matter who gave me the money You wanted to know\nwhen I last saw Mother alive.",
    "That was when.",
    "She was sitting at the table\nporing over a lot of plans.",
    "And I said I wanted cash and then Kirsten\ncalled out that she\u2019d give it to me.",
    "I took it from her and then went into\nMother\u2019s room again and said good night to Mother and she said she\nhoped I\u2019d enjoy the play and to be careful driving.",
    "She always said that.",
    "And then I went out to the garage and got the car out.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Miss Lindstrom.\u201d\n\u201cOh she went off as soon as she\u2019d given me the money.\u201d\nKirsten Lindstrom said quickly \u201cHester passed me in the car just as I\ngot to the end of our road.",
    "She must have started almost immediately\nafter me.",
    "She went on up the hill to the main road whilst I turned left to\nthe village.\u201d\nHester opened her mouth as though to speak then quickly shut it\nagain.",
    "Huish wondered.",
    "Was Kirsten Lindstrom trying to establish that\nHester would not have had time to commit the crime Wasn\u2019t it possible\nthat instead of Hester\u2019s saying a quiet good night to Mrs. Argyle there\nhad been an argument\u2014a quarrel and that Hester had struck her down\nSmoothly he turned to Kirsten and said\n\u201cNow Miss Lindstrom let\u2019s have your account of what you\nremember.\u201d\nShe was nervous.",
    "Her hands twisted uncomfortably.",
    "\u201cWe had tea.",
    "It was cleared away.",

    "I let him in.",
    "He said he had lost his key.",
    "He went straight in to\nhis mother.",
    "He said at once \u2018I\u2019m in a jam.",
    "You\u2019ve got to get me out of\n\n\fit.\u2019 I did not hear any more.",
    "I went back into the kitchen.",
    "There were\nthings to prepare for supper.\u201d\n\u201cDid you hear him leave\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed.",
    "He was shouting.",
    "I came from the kitchen.",
    "He was\nstanding there in the front hall\u2014very angry\u2014shouting out that he\u2019d\ncome back that his mother had better have the money ready for him.",
    "Or\nelse That is what he said \u2018Or else\u2019 It was a threat.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then\u201d\n\u201cHe went off banging the door.",
    "Mrs. Argyle came out into the hall.",
    "She was very pale and upset.",
    "She said to me \u2018You heard\u2019\n\u201cI said \u2018He is in trouble\u2019\n\u201cShe nodded.",
    "Then she went upstairs to the library to Mr. Argyle.",
    "I\nlaid the table for supper and then I went up to put my outdoor things on.",
    "The Women\u2019s Institute were having a Flower Arrangement Competition\nnext day.",
    "There were some Flower Arrangement books we had promised\nthem.\u201d\n\u201cYou took the books to the Institute\u2014what time did you return to the\nhouse\u201d\n\u201cIt must have been about half past seven.",
    "I let myself in with my key.",
    "I went in at once to Mrs. Argyle\u2019s room\u2014to give her a message of\nthanks and a note\u2014she was at the desk her head forward on her hands.",
    "And there was the poker flung down\u2014and drawers of the bureau pulled\nout.",
    "There had been a burglar I thought.",
    "She had been attacked.",
    "And I\nwas right.",
    "Now you know that I was right It was a burglar\u2014someone\nfrom outside\u201d\n\u201cSomeone whom Mrs. Argyle herself let in\u201d\n\u201cWhy not\u201d said Kirsten defiantly.",
    "\u201cShe was kind\u2014always very\nkind.",
    "And she was not afraid\u2014of people or things.",
    "Besides it is not as\nthough she were alone in the house.",
    "There were others\u2014her husband\nGwenda Mary.",
    "She had only to call out.\u201d\n\u201cBut she didn\u2019t call out.\u201d Huish pointed out.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "Because whoever it was must have told her some very plausible\nstory.",
    "She would always listen.",
    "And so she sat down again at the desk\u2014\nperhaps to look for her chequebook\u2014because she was unsuspicious\u2014so\nhe had the chance to snatch up the poker and hit her.",
    "Perhaps even he\ndid not mean to kill her.",
    "He just wanted to stun her and look for money\nand jewellery and go.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t look very far\u2014just turned out a few drawers.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he heard sounds in the house\u2014or lost his nerve.",
    "Or found\nperhaps that he had killed her.",
    "And so quickly in panic he goes.\u201d\n\n\fShe leaned forward.",
    "Her eyes were both frightened and pleading.",

    "\u201cIt seems as though it must be so\u201d he acquiesced pleasantly.",
    "A faint\nsigh of relief escaped her.",

    "\u201cYes I have.",

    "They ought to have told what they knew.",
    "The\nonly safe thing if a murderer is about is to tell the police anything you\nknow at once.",
    "Well they didn\u2019t.",
    "They held out on me.",

    "\u201cYes.",
    "I\u2019d say too that Micky was fond of her in a\nway.",
    "But being fond of anyone isn\u2019t enough if you\u2019re mad with fear.",
    "Whatever she knew was probably more deadly than she herself realized.",
    "That\u2019s why after she found Durrant dead and she came rushing out\nstraight into his arms he took his chance and stabbed her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s merely conjecture on your part isn\u2019t it Superintendent\nHuish\u201d\n\u201cNot entirely conjecture Dr. Calgary.",

    "Oh it needed splitsecond timing but it\u2019s astonishing\nwhat audacity will do sometimes.",
    "And he was desperate.",
    "At all costs he\nhad to prevent Tina and Durrant meeting.",
    "To be safe he had to kill them\nboth.\u201d\nCalgary thought for a moment or two.",

    "\u201cAll right Dr. Calgary I\u2019ll tell you exactly what she said.",
    "First of all\nshe said a name.",
    "Micky\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cShe has accused him then\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like\u201d said Huish nodding his head.",
    "\u201cThe rest of\nwhat she said didn\u2019t make sense.",

    "\u201cCan\nyou make any sense of that\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Calgary.",
    "He shook his head and said wonderingly \u201cThe\ndove on the mast\u2026 That seems a very extraordinary thing to say.\u201d\n\u201cNo masts and no doves as far as we know\u201d said Huish.",
    "\u201cBut it\nmeant something to her something in her own mind.",
    "But it mayn\u2019t you\nknow have been anything to do with the murder.",
    "Goodness knows what\nrealms of fancy she\u2019s floating in.\u201d\nCalgary was silent for some moments.",
    "He sat thinking things over.",
    "He said \u201cYou\u2019ve arrested Micky\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve detained him.",
    "He will be charged within twentyfour hours.\u201d\nHuish looked curiously at Calgary.",
    "\u201cI gather that this lad Micky wasn\u2019t your answer to the problem\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cNo Micky wasn\u2019t my answer.",

    "I must see them all.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Huish \u201cbe careful of yourself Dr. Calgary.",
    "What is your\nidea by the way\u201d\n\u201cWould it mean anything to you\u201d said Calgary \u201cif I told you that it is\nmy belief that this was a crime of passion\u201d\nHuish\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "\u201cThere are a lot of passions Dr. Calgary\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHate avarice\ngreed fear they\u2019re all passions.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I said a crime of passion\u201d said Calgary \u201cI meant exactly\nwhat one usually means by that term.\u201d\n\u201cIf you mean Gwenda Vaughan and Leo Argyle\u201d said Huish \u201cthat\u2019s\nwhat we\u2019ve thought all along you know but it doesn\u2019t seem to fit.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that\u201d said Arthur Calgary.",

    "Behind her in the hall he saw as he had seen before\nthe watchful suspicious figure of Kirsten Lindstrom.",
    "It was history\nrepeating itself.",
    "Then the pattern wavered and changed.",
    "The suspicion and the\ndesperation went out of Hester\u2019s face.",

    "\u201cYou\u201d she said.",

    "\u201cI\u2019ve got to finish what I began\u201d said Calgary.",
    "Very gently he put a hand on her shoulder and moved her slightly\naside.",

    "\u201cSit down\u201d said Leo.",
    "He indicated a chair on the other side of the\nfireplace and Calgary sat there.",
    "\u201cYou must forgive me\u201d said Leo \u201cif I say at this moment that I wish\nyou\u2019d never come here in the first place Dr. Calgary.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfair\u201d said Hester fiercely.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a terribly unfair thing to\nsay.\u201d\n\u201cI know what you must feel\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cI think in your place I\nshould feel much the same.",
    "Perhaps I even shared your view for a short\nperiod but on reflection I still cannot see that there was anything else\nthat I could have done.\u201d\nKirsten reentered the room.",
    "\u201cMary is coming\u201d she said.",
    "They sat in silence waiting and presently Mary Durrant entered the\nroom.",
    "Calgary looked at her with interest since it was the first time he\nhad seen her.",
    "She looked calm and composed neatly dressed every hair\nin place.",
    "But her face was masklike in its lack of expression and there\nwas an air about her as of a woman who walks in her sleep.",
    "Leo made an introduction.",
    "She bowed her head slightly.",
    "\u201cIt is good of you to come Mrs. Durrant\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cI thought\nyou ought to hear what I have to say.\u201d\n\u201cAs you please\u201d said Mary.",
    "\u201cBut nothing that you can say or anyone\ncan say will bring Philip back again.\u201d\n\n\fShe went a little way away from them and sat down in a chair by the\nwindow.",
    "Calgary looked round him.",
    "\u201cLet me first say this When I came here the first time when I told\nyou that I was able to clear Jacko\u2019s name your reception of my news\npuzzled me.",
    "I understand it now.",
    "But the thing that made the greatest\nimpression upon me was what this child here\u201d\u2014he looked at Hester\n\u2014\u201csaid to me as I left.",
    "She said that it was not justice that mattered it\nwas what happened to the innocent.",
    "There is a phrase in the latest\ntranslation of the Book of Job that describes it.",
    "The calamity of the\ninnocent.",
    "As a result of my news that is what you have all been suffering.",
    "The innocent should not suffer and must not suffer and it is to end the\nsuffering of the innocent that I am here now to say what I have to say.\u201d\nHe paused for a moment or two but no one spoke.",
    "In his quiet\npedantic voice Arthur Calgary went on\n\u201cWhen I came here first it was not as I thought to bring you what\nmight be described as tidings of great joy.",
    "You had all accepted Jacko\u2019s\nguilt.",
    "You were all if I may say so satisfied with it.",
    "It was the best\nsolution that there could be in the murder of Mrs. Argyle.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that speaking a little harshly\u201d asked Leo.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d said Calgary \u201cit is the truth.",
    "Jacko was satisfactory to you all\nas the criminal since there could be no real question of an outsider\nhaving committed the crime and because in the case of Jacko you could\nfind the necessary excuses.",
    "He was unfortunate a mental invalid not\nresponsible for his actions a problem or delinquent boy All the phrases\nthat we can use nowadays so happily to excuse guilt.",
    "You said Mr.\nArgyle that you did not blame him.",
    "You said his mother the victim\nwould not have blamed him.",
    "Only one person blamed him.\u201d He looked at\nKirsten Lindstrom.",
    "\u201cYou blamed him.",
    "You said fairly and squarely that\nhe was wicked.",
    "That is the term you used.",
    "\u2018Jacko was wicked\u2019 you\nsaid.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Kirsten Lindstrom.",
    "\u201cPerhaps\u2014yes perhaps I said\nthat.",
    "It was true.\u201d\n\u201cYes it was true.",
    "He was wicked.",
    "If he had not been wicked none of\nthis would have happened.",
    "Yet you know quite well\u201d said Calgary \u201cthat\nmy evidence cleared him of the actual crime.\u201d\nKirsten said\n\u201cOne cannot always believe evidence.",
    "You had concussion.",
    "I know\nvery well what concussion does to people.",
    "They remember things not\nclearly but in a kind of blur.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cSo that is still your solution\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cYou think that Jacko\nactually committed that crime and that in some way he managed to fake\nan alibi Is that right\u201d\n\u201cI do not know the details.",
    "Yes something of that sort.",
    "I still say he\ndid it.",
    "All the suffering that has gone on here and the deaths\u2014yes these\nterrible deaths\u2014they are all his doing.",
    "All Jacko\u2019s doing\u201d\nHester cried\n\u201cBut Kirsten you were always devoted to Jacko.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Kirsten \u201cyes perhaps.",
    "But I still say he was\nwicked.\u201d\n\u201cThere I think you are right\u201d said Calgary \u201cbut in another way you\nare wrong.",
    "Concussion or no concussion my memory is perfectly clear.",
    "On the night of Mrs. Argyle\u2019s death I gave Jacko a lift at the stated time.",
    "There is no possibility\u2014and I repeat those words strongly\u2014there is no\npossibility that Jacko Argyle killed his adopted mother that night.",
    "His\nalibi holds.\u201d\nLeo moved with a trace of restlessness.",
    "Calgary went on\n\u201cYou think that I\u2019m repeating the same thing over and over again\nNot quite.",
    "There are other points to be considered.",
    "One of them is the\nstatement that I got from Superintendent Huish that Jacko was very glib\nand assured when giving his alibi.",
    "He had it all pat and ready the times\nthe place almost as though he knew he might need it.",
    "That ties up with\nthe conversation I had about him with Dr. MacMaster who has had a\nvery wide experience of borderline delinquent cases.",
    "He said he was not\nso surprised at Jacko having the seeds of murder in his heart but he was\nsurprised that he had actually carried one out.",
    "He said the type of murder\nhe would have expected was one where Jacko egged on someone else to\ncommit the crime.",
    "So I came to the point where I asked myself this Did\nJacko know that a crime was to be committed that night Did he know\nthat he would need an alibi and did he deliberately go about giving\nhimself one If so someone else killed Mrs. Argyle but\u2014Jacko knew\nshe was going to be killed and one may fairly say that he was the\ninstigator of the crime.\u201d\nHe said to Kirsten Lindstrom\n\u201cYou feel that don\u2019t you You still feel it or you want to feel it You\nfeel that it was Jacko who killed her not you\u2026 You feel it was under his\norders and under his influence you did it.",
    "Therefore you want all the\nblame to be his\u201d\n\u201cI\u201d said Kirsten Lindstrom.",
    "\u201cI What are you saying\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019m saying\u201d said Calgary \u201cthat there was only one person in this\nhouse who could in any way fit into the role of Jacko Argyle\u2019s\naccomplice.",
    "And that is you Miss Lindstrom.",
    "Jacko has a record behind\nhim a record of being able to inspire passion in middleaged women.",
    "He\nemployed that power deliberately.",
    "He had the gift of making himself\nbelieved.\u201d He leaned forward.",
    "\u201cHe made love to you didn\u2019t he\u201d he said\ngently.",
    "\u201cHe made you believe that he cared for you that he wanted to\nmarry you that after this was over and he\u2019d got more control of his\nmother\u2019s money you would be married and go away somewhere.",
    "That is\nright isn\u2019t it\u201d\nKirsten stared at him.",
    "She did not speak.",
    "It was as though she were\nparalysed.",
    "\u201cIt was done cruelly and heartlessly and deliberately\u201d said Arthur\nCalgary.",
    "\u201cHe came here that night desperate for some money with the\nshadow over him of arrest and a jail sentence.",
    "Mrs. Argyle refused to\ngive him money.",
    "When he was refused by her he applied to you.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think\u201d said Kirsten Lindstrom \u201cdo you think that I would\nhave taken Mrs. Argyle\u2019s money to give him instead of giving him my\nown\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Calgary \u201cyou would have given him your own if you\u2019d\nhad any.",
    "But I don\u2019t think you had \u2026 You had a good income from the\nannuity which Mrs. Argyle had bought for you but I think he\u2019d already\nmilked you dry of that.",
    "So he was desperate that evening and when Mrs.\nArgyle had gone up to her husband in the library you went outside the\nhouse where he was waiting and he told you what you had to do.",
    "First\nyou must give him the money and then before the theft could be\ndiscovered Mrs. Argyle had to be killed.",
    "Because she would not have\ncovered up the theft.",
    "He said it would be easy.",
    "You had just to pull out\nthe drawers to make it look as though a burglar had been there and to hit\nher on the back of the head.",
    "It would be painless he said.",
    "She would not\nfeel anything.",
    "He himself would establish an alibi so that you must be\ncareful to do this thing within the right time limits between seven and\nseventhirty.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true\u201d said Kirsten.",
    "She had begun to tremble.",
    "\u201cYou are mad\nto say such things.\u201d\nYet there was no indignation in her voice.",
    "Strangely enough it was\nmechanical and weary.",
    "\u201cEven if what you say is true\u201d she said \u201cdo you think I would let\nhim be accused of the murder\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh yes\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cAfter all he had told you he would have an\nalibi.",
    "You expected him perhaps to be arrested and then to prove his\ninnocence.",
    "That was all part of the plan.\u201d\n\u201cBut when he couldn\u2019t prove his innocence\u201d said Kirsten.",
    "\u201cWould I\nnot have saved him then\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Calgary \u201cperhaps\u2014but for one fact.",
    "The fact that on\nthe morning after the murder Jacko\u2019s wife turned up here.",
    "You didn\u2019t\nknow he was married.",
    "The girl had to repeat the statement two or three\ntimes before you would believe her.",
    "At that moment your world crashed\naround you.",
    "You saw Jacko for what he was\u2014heartless scheming\nwithout a particle of affection for you.",
    "You realized what he had made\nyou do.\u201d\nSuddenly Kirsten Lindstrom was speaking.",
    "The words came rushing\nout incoherently.",
    "\u201cI loved him \u2026 I loved him with all my heart.",
    "I was a fool a\ncredulous middleaged doting fool.",
    "He made me think it\u2014he made me\nbelieve it.",
    "He said he had never cared for girls.",
    "He said\u2014I cannot tell\nyou all the things he said.",
    "I loved him.",
    "I tell you I loved him.",
    "And then\nthat silly simpering child came here that common little thing.",
    "I saw it\nwas all lies all wickedness wickedness \u2026His wickedness not mine.\u201d\n\u201cThe night I came here\u201d said Calgary \u201cyou were afraid weren\u2019t\nyou You were afraid of what was going to happen.",
    "You were afraid for\nthe others.",
    "Hester whom you loved Leo whom you were fond of.",
    "You\nsaw perhaps a little of what this might do to them.",
    "But principally you\nwere afraid for yourself.",
    "And you see where fear has led you \u2026 You\nhave two more deaths on your hands now.\u201d\n\u201cYou are saying I killed Tina and Philip\u201d\n\u201cOf course you killed them\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cTina has recovered\nconsciousness.\u201d\nKirsten\u2019s shoulders dropped in the sagging of despair.",
    "\u201cSo she has told you that I stabbed her.",
    "I did not think she even knew.",
    "I was mad of course.",
    "I was mad by then mad with terror.",
    "It was coming\nso close\u2014so close.\u201d\n\u201cShall I tell you what Tina said when she regained consciousness\u201d\nsaid Calgary.",
    "\u201cShe said \u2018The cup was empty.\u2019 I knew what that meant.",
    "You pretended to be taking up a cup of coffee to Philip Durrant but\nactually you had already stabbed him and were coming out of that room\nwhen you heard Tina coming.",
    "So you turned round and pretended you\nwere taking the tray in.",
    "Later although she was shocked almost into\nunconsciousness by his death she noticed automatically that the cup that\n\n\fhad dropped on the floor was an empty cup and there was no stain of\ncoffee left by it.\u201d\nHester cried out\n\u201cBut Kirsten couldn\u2019t have stabbed her Tina walked downstairs and\nout to Micky.",
    "She was quite all right.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear child\u201d said Calgary \u201cpeople who have been stabbed have\nwalked the length of a street without even knowing what has happened to\nthem In the state of shock Tina was in she would hardly have felt\nanything.",
    "A pinprick a slight pain perhaps.\u201d He looked again at Kirsten.",
    "\u201cAnd later\u201d he said \u201cyou slipped that knife into Micky\u2019s pocket.",
    "That\nwas the meanest thing of all.\u201d\nKirsten\u2019s hands flew out pleadingly.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it\u2014I could not help it \u2026 It was coming so near \u2026\nThey were all beginning to find out.",
    "Philip was finding out and Tina\u2014I\nthink Tina must have overheard Jacko talking to me outside the kitchen\nthat evening.",
    "They were all beginning to know \u2026 I wanted to be safe.",
    "I\nwanted\u2014one can never be safe\u201d Her hands dropped.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to\nkill Tina.",
    "As for Philip\u2014\u201d\nMary Durrant rose.",
    "She came across the room slowly but with\nincreasing purpose.",
    "\u201cYou killed Philip\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou killed Philip.\u201d\nSuddenly like a tigress she sprang at the other woman.",
    "It was\nGwenda quickwitted who sprang to her feet and caught hold of her.",
    "Calgary joined her and together they held her back.",
    "\u201cYou\u2014you\u201d cried Mary Durrant.",
    "Kirsten Lindstrom looked at her.",
    "\u201cWhat business was it of his\u201d she asked.",
    "\u201cWhy did he have to snoop\nround and ask questions He was never threatened.",
    "It was never a matter\nof life or death for him.",
    "It was just\u2014an amusement.\u201d She turned and\nwalked slowly towards the door.",
    "Without looking at them she went out.",
    "\u201cStop her\u201d cried Hester.",
    "\u201cOh we must stop her.\u201d\nLeo Argyle said\n\u201cLet her go Hester.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014she\u2019ll kill herself.\u201d\n\u201cI rather doubt it\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cShe has been our faithful friend for so long\u201d said Leo.",
    "\u201cFaithful\ndevoted\u2014and now this\u201d\n\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll\u2014give herself up\u201d said Gwenda.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s far more likely\u201d said Calgary \u201cthat she\u2019ll go to the nearest\nstation and take a train for London.",
    "But she won\u2019t of course be able to\n\n\fget away with it.",
    "She\u2019ll be traced and found.\u201d\n\u201cOur dear Kirsten\u201d said Leo again.",
    "His voice shook.",
    "\u201cSo faithful so\ngood to us all.\u201d\nGwenda caught him by the arm and shook it.",
    "\u201cHow can you Leo how can you Think what she did to us all\u2014\nwhat she has made us suffer\u201d\n\u201cI know\u201d said Leo \u201cbut she suffered herself you know as well.",
    "I\nthink it is her suffering we have felt in this house.\u201d\n\u201cWe might have gone on suffering for ever\u201d said Gwenda \u201cas far as\nshe was concerned If it hadn\u2019t been for Dr. Calgary here.\u201d She turned\ntowards him gratefully.",
    "\u201cSo at last\u201d said Calgary \u201cI have done something to help though\nrather late in the day.\u201d\n\u201cToo late\u201d said Mary bitterly.",
    "\u201cToo late Oh why didn\u2019t we know\u2014\nwhy didn\u2019t we guess\u201d She turned accusingly on Hester.",
    "\u201cI thought it\nwas you.",
    "I always thought it was you.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t\u201d said Hester.",
    "She looked at Calgary.",
    "Mary Durrant said quietly\n\u201cI wish I were dead.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear child\u201d said Leo \u201chow I wish I could help you.\u201d\n\u201cNobody can help me\u201d said Mary.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all Philip\u2019s own fault\nwanting to stay on here wanting to mess about with this business.",
    "Getting himself killed.\u201d She looked round at them.",
    "\u201cNone of you\nunderstand.\u201d She went out of the room.",
    "Calgary and Hester followed her.",
    "As they went through the door\nCalgary looking back saw Leo\u2019s arm pass round Gwenda\u2019s shoulders.",
    "\u201cShe warned me you know\u201d said Hester.",
    "Her eyes were wide and\nscared.",
    "\u201cShe told me right at the beginning not to trust her to be as afraid\nof her as I was of everyone else\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cForget it my dear\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cThat is the thing you have to do\nnow.",
    "Forget.",
    "All of you are free now.",
    "The innocent are no longer in the\nshadow of guilt.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Tina Will she get well She is not going to die\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will die\u201d said Calgary.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s in love with Micky\nisn\u2019t she\u201d\n\u201cI suppose she might be\u201d said Hester in a surprised voice.",
    "\u201cI never\nthought about it.",
    "They\u2019ve always been brother and sister of course.",
    "But\nthey\u2019re not really brother and sister.\u201d\n\u201cBy the way Hester would you have any idea what Tina meant when\nshe said \u2018The dove on the mast.\u2019\u201d\n\n\f\u201cDove on the mast\u201d Hester frowned.",
    "\u201cWait a minute.",
    "It sounds\nterribly familiar.",
    "The dove on the mast as we sailed fast.",
    "Did mourn and\nmourn and mourn.",
    "Is that it\u201d\n\u201cIt might be\u201d said Calgary.",

    "\u201cYes yes I see\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps they\u2019ll get married\u201d said Hester \u201cwhen Tina gets well and\nthen she can go out to Kuwait with him.",
    "Tina always wanted to be\nsomewhere where it\u2019s warm.",
