    "Agatha Christie  Elephants Can Remember\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I A Literary Luncheon\nMrs. Oliver looked at herself in the glass.",
    "She gave a brief sideways look towards the clock on the\nmantelpiece which she had some idea was twenty minutes slow.",
    "Then she resumed her study of her\ncoiffure.",
    "The trouble with Mrs.\nOliver wasand she admitted it freelythat her styles of hairdressing were always being changed.",
    "She\nhad tried almost everything in turn.",
    "A severe pompadour at one time then a windswept style where you\nbrushed back your locks to display an intellectual brow at least she hoped the brow was intellectual.",
    "She\nhad tried tightly arranged curls she had tried a kind of artistic disarray.",
    "She had to admit that it did not\nmatter very much today what her type of hairdressing was because today she was going to do what she\nvery seldom didwear a hat.",
    "On the top shelf of Mrs. Olivers wardrobe there reposed four hats.",
    "One was definitely allotted to\nweddings.",
    "When you went to a wedding a hat was a must.",
    "But even then Mrs.\nOliver kept two.",
    "One in a round bandbox was of feathers.",
    "It fitted closely to the head and stood up\nvery well to sudden squalls of rain if they should overtake one unexpectedly as one passed from a car to\nthe interior of the sacred edifice or as so often nowadays a registrars office.",
    "The other and more elaborate hat was definitely for attending a wedding held on a Saturday afternoon in\nsummer.",
    "It had flowers and chiffon and a covering of yellow net attached with mimosa The other two\nhats on the shelf were of a more allpurpose character.",
    "One was what Mrs. Oliver called her country\nhouse hat made of tan felt suitable for wearing with tweeds of almost any pattern with a becoming brim\nthat you could turn up or turn down.",
    "Mrs. Oliver had a cashmere pullover for warmth and a thin pullover for hot days either of which was\nsuitable in color to go with this.",
    "However though the pullovers were frequently worn the hat was\npractically never worn.",
    "Because really why put on a hat just to go to the country and have a meal with\nyour friends\nThe fourth hat was the most expensive of the lot and it had extraordinary advantages about it.",
    "Possibly\nMrs. Oliver sometimes thought because it was so expensive.",
    "It consisted of a kind of turban of various\nlayers of contrasting velvets all of rather becoming pastel shades which would go with anything.",
    "Mrs. Oliver paused in doubt and then called for assistance.",
    "Maria she said then louder Maria.",
    "Come here a minute.",
    "Maria came.",
    "She was used to being asked\nto give advice on what Mrs. Oliver was thinking of wearing.",
    "Going to wear your lovely smart hat are you said Maria.",
    "Yes said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I wanted to know whether you think it looks best this way or the other way\nround.",
    "Maria stood back and took a look.",
    "Well thats back to front youre wearing it now isnt it Yes I know said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I know that\nquite well.",
    "But I thought somehow it looked better that way.",
    "Oh why should it said Maria.",
    "Well its meant I suppose.",
    "But its got to be meant by me as well as the shop that sold it said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Why do you think its better the wrong way round Because you get that lovely shade of blue and the\ndark brown and I think that looks better than the other way which is green with the red and the\nchocolate color.",
    "At this point Mrs. Oliver removed the hat put it on again and tried it wrong way round\nright way round and sideways which both she and Maria disapproved of.",
    "You cant have it the wide way.",
    "I mean its wrong for your face isnt it Itd be wrong for anyones\nface.",
    "No.",
    "That wont do.",
    "I think Ill have it the right way round after all.",
    "Well I think its safer\nalways said Maria.",
    "Mrs. Oliver took off the hat.",
    "Maria assisted her to put on a wellcut thin woolen dress of a delicate puce\ncolor and helped her to adjust the hat.",
    "You look ever so smart said Maria.",
    "That was what Mrs. Oliver liked so much about Maria.",
    "If given the least excuse for saying so she always\napproved and gave praise Going to make a speech at the luncheon are you Maria asked.",
    "A speech Mrs. Oliver sounded horrified.",
    "No of course not.",
    "You know I never make speeches.",
    "Well I thought they always did at these here literary luncheons.",
    "Thats what youre going to isnt it\nFamous writers of nineteen seventythreeor wherever year it is weve got to now.",
    "I dont need to\nmake a speech said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Several other people who like doing it will be making speeches and\nthey are much better at it than I would be.",
    "Im sure youd make a lovely speech if you put your mind to\nit said Maria adjusting herself to the role of a tempter.",
    "No I shouldnt said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I know what I can do and I know what I cant.",
    "I cant make\nspeeches.",
    "I get all worried and nervy and I should probably stammer or say the same thing twice.",
    "I\nshould not only feel silly I should probabiy look silly.",
    "Now its all right with words.",
    "You can write words\ndown or speak them into a machine or dictate them.",
    "I can do things with words so long as I know its not\na speech Im making.",
    "Oh well.",
    "I hope everythingll go all right.",
    "But Im sure it will.",
    "Quite a grand\nluncheon isnt it Yes said Mrs. Oliver in a deeply depressed voice.",
    "Quite a grand luncheon.",
    "And\nwhy she thought but did not say why on earth am I going to it She searched her mind for a bit because\nshe always really liked knowing what she was doing instead of doing it first and wondering why she had\ndone it afterwards.",
    "I suppose she said again to herself and not to Maria who had had to return rather hurriedly to the\nkitchen summoned by a smell of overflowing jam which she happened to have on the stove I wanted to\nsee what it felt like.",
    "Im always being asked to literary lunches or something like that and I never go.",
    "Mrs. Oliver arrived at the last course of the grand luncheon with a sigh of satisfaction as she toyed with\nthe remains of the meringue on her plate.",
    "She was particularly fond of meringues and it was a delicious\nlast course in a very delicious luncheon.",
    "Nevertheless when one reached middle age one had to be\ncareful with meringues.",
    "Ones teeth They looked all right they had the great advantage that they could\nnot ache they were white and quite agreeablelookingjust like the real thing.",
    "But it was true enough that\nthey were not real teeth.",
    "And teeth that were not real teethor so Mrs. Oliver believedwere not really\nof highclass material.",
    "Dogs she had always understood had teeth of real ivory but human beings had\nteeth merely of bone.",
    "Or she supposed if they were false teeth of plastic.",
    "Anyway the point was that\nyou mustnt get involved in some rather shamemaking appearance which false teeth might lead you into.",
    "Lettuce was a difficulty and salted almonds and such things as chocolates with hard centers clinging\n\n\fcaramels and the delicious stickiness and adherence of meringues.",
    "With a sigh of satisfaction she dealt\nwith the final mouthful.",
    "It had been a good lunch a very good lunch.",
    "Mrs. Oliver was fond of her creature comforts.",
    "She had enjoyed the luncheon very much.",
    "She had\nenjoyed the company too.",
    "The luncheon which had been given to celebrated female writers had\nfortunately not been confined to female writers only.",
    "There had been other writers and critics and those\nwho read books as well as those who wrote them.",
    "Mrs. Oliver had sat between two very charming\nmembers of the male sex.",
    "Edwin Aubyn whose poetry she always enjoyed an extremely entertaining person who had had various\nentertaining experiences in his tours abroad and various literary and personal adventures.",
    "Also he was\ninterested in restaurants and food and they had talked very happily about food and left the subject of\nliterature aside.",
    "Sir Wesley Kent on her other side had also been an agreeable lunch companion.",
    "He had said very nice\nthings about her books and had had the tact to say things that did not make her feel embarrassed which\nso many people could do almost without trying.",
    "He had mentioned one or two reasons why he had liked\none or other of her books and they had been the right reasons and therefore Mrs. Oliver had thought\nfavorably of him for that reason.",
    "Praise from men Mrs. Oliver thought to herself is always acceptable.",
    "It\nwas women who gushed.",
    "Some of the things that women wrote to her Really\nNot always women of course.",
    "Sometimes emotional young men from very faraway countries.",
    "Only last\nweek she had received a fan letter beginning Reading your book I feel what a noble woman you must\nbe.",
    "After reading The Second Goldfish he had then gone off into an intense kind of literary ecstasy which\nwas Mrs. Oliver felt completely unfitting.",
    "She was not unduly modest.",
    "She thought the detective stories she wrote were quite good of their kind.",
    "Some were not so good and some were much better than others.",
    "But there was no reason so far as she\ncould see to make anyone think she was a noble woman.",
    "She was a lucky woman who had established\na happy knack of writing what quite a lot of people wanted to read.",
    "Wonderful luck that was Mrs.\nOliver thought to herself.",
    "Well all things considered she had got through this ordeal very well.",
    "She had quite enjoyed herself\ntalked to some nice people.",
    "Now they were moving to where coffee was being handed round and where\nyou could change partners and chat with other people.",
    "This was the moment of danger as Mrs.\nOliver knew well.",
    "This was now where other women would come and attack her.",
    "Attack her with\nfulsome praise and where she always felt lamentably inefficient at giving the right answers because there\nwerent really any right answers that you could give.",
    "It went really rather like a travel book for going\nabroad with the right phrases.",
    "Question I must tell you how very fond I am of reading your books and how wonderful I think they\nare.",
    "Answer from flustered author Well thats very kind.",
    "I am so glad.",
    "You must understand that Ive\nbeen waiting to meet you for months.",
    "It really is wonderful.",
    "Oh its very nice of you.",
    "Very nice indeed.",
    "It went on very much like that.",
    "Neither of you seemed to be able to talk about anything of outside\ninterest.",
    "It had to be all about your books or the other womans books if you knew what her books\nwere.",
    "You were in the literary web and you werent good at this sort of stuff.",
    "Some people could do it\nbut Mrs. Oliver was bitterly aware of not having the proper capacity.",
    "A foreign friend of hers had once\nput her when she was staying at an embassy abroad through a kind of course.",
    "I listen to you Albertina had said in her charming low foreign voice.",
    "I have listened to what you say\n\n\fto that young man who came from the newspaper to interview you.",
    "You have not gotno you have not\ngot the pride you should have in your work.",
    "You should say Yes I write well.",
    "I write better than anyone\nelse who writes detective stories.",
    "But I dont Mrs. Oliver had said at that moment.",
    "Im not bad\nbut Ah do not say I dont like that.",
    "You must say you do even if you do not think you do you\nought to say you do.",
    "I wish Albertina said Mrs. Oliver that you could interview these journalists\nwho come.",
    "You would do it so well.",
    "Cant you pretend to be me one day and Ill listen behind the door Yes I suppose I could do it.",
    "It\nwould be rather fun.",
    "But they would know I was not you.",
    "They know your face.",
    "But you must say Yes\nyes I know that I am better than anyone else.",
    "You must say that to everybody.",
    "They should know it.",
    "They should announce it.",
    "Oh yesit is terrible to hear you sitting there and say things as though you\napologize for what you are.",
    "It must not be like that.",
    "It had been rather Mrs. Oliver thought as though\nshe had been a budding actress trying to learn a part and the director had found her hopelessly bad at\ntaking direction.",
    "Well anyway thered be not much difficulty here.",
    "Thered be a few waiting females\nwhen they all got up from the table.",
    "In fact she could see one or two hovering already.",
    "That wouldnt\nmatter much.",
    "She would go and smile and be nice and say So kind of you.",
    "Im so pleased.",
    "One is so glad to know people like ones books.",
    "All the stale old things.",
    "Rather as\nthough you put a hand into a box and took out some useful words already strung together like a necklace\nof beads.",
    "And then before very long now she could leave.",
    "Her eyes went round the table because she might perhaps see some friends there as well as wouldbe\nadmirers.",
    "Yes she did see in the distance Maurine Grant who was great fun.",
    "The moment came the literary women and the attendant cavaliers who had also attended the lunch rose.",
    "They streamed towards chairs towards coffee tables towards sofas and confidential corners.",
    "The\nmoment of peril Mrs. Oliver often thought of it to herself though usually at cocktails and not literary\nparties because she seldom went to the latter.",
    "At any moment the danger might arise as someone whom\nyou did not remember but who remembered you or someone whom you definitely did not want to talk\nto but whom you found you could not avoid.",
    "In this case it was the first dilemma that came to her.",
    "A\nlarge woman.",
    "Ample proportions large white champing teeth.",
    "What in French could have been called\nune femme formidable but who definitely had not only the French variety of being formidable but the\nEnglish one of being supremely bossy.",
    "Obviously she either knew Mrs. Oliver or was intent on making\nher acquaintance there and then.",
    "The last was how it happened to go.",
    "Oh Mrs. Oliver she said in a highpitched voice.",
    "What a pleasure to meet you today.",
    "I have wanted\nto for so long.",
    "I simply adore your books.",
    "So does my son.",
    "And my husband used to insist on never\ntraveling without at least two of your books.",
    "But come do sit down.",
    "There are so many things I want to\nask you about.",
    "Oh well thought Mrs. Oliver not my favorite type of woman this.",
    "But as well her as\nany other.",
    "She allowed herself to be conducted in a firm way rather as a police officer might have done.",
    "She was\ntaken to a settee for two across a corner and her new friend accepted coffee and placed coffee before\nher also.",
    "There.",
    "Now we are settled.",
    "I dont suppose you know my name.",
    "I am Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "Oh yes\nsaid Mrs. Oliver embarrassed as usual.",
    "Mrs.\n\n\fBurtonCox Did she write books also No she couldnt really remember anything about her.",
    "But she\nseemed to have heard the name.",
    "A faint thought came to her.",
    "A book on politics something like that\nNot fiction not fun not crime.",
    "Perhaps a highcrow intellectual with political bias That ought to be easy Mrs. Oliver thought with relief.",
    "I can just let her talk and say How interesting from time to time.",
    "Youll be very surprised really at what Im going to say said Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "But I have felt from\nreading your books how sympathetic you are how much you understand of human nature.",
    "And I feel\nthat if there is anyone who can give me an answer to the question I want to ask you will be the one to do\nso.",
    "I dont think really... said Mrs. Oliver trying to think of suitable words to say that she felt very\nuncertain of being able to rise to the heights demanded of her.",
    "Mrs. BurtonCox dipped a lump of sugar in her coffee and crunched it in a rather carnivorous way as\nthough it was a bone.",
    "Ivory teeth perhaps thought Mrs. Oliver vaguely.",
    "Ivory\nDogs had ivory walruses had ivory and elephants had ivory of course.",
    "Great big tusks of ivory.",
    "Mrs.\nBurtonCox was saying Now the first thing I must ask you\u2014Im pretty sure that I am right\nthough\u2014you have a goddaughter havent you A daughter whos called Celia Ravenscroft Oh said\nMrs. Oliver rather pleasurably surprised.",
    "She felt she could deal perhaps with a goddaughter.",
    "She had a\ngood many goddaughters\u2014and godsons for that matter.",
    "There were times she had to admit as the years\nwere growing upon her when she couldnt remember them all.",
    "She had done her duty in due course\nones duty being to send toys to your godchildren at Christmas in their early years to visit them and their\nparents or to have them visit you during the course of their upbringing to take the boys out from school\nperhaps and the girls also.",
    "And then when the crowning days came either the twentyfirst birthday at\nwhich a godmother must do the right thing and let it be acknowledged to be done and do it handsomely\nor else marriage which entailed the same type of gift and a financial or other blessing.",
    "After that\ngodchildren rather receded into the middle or far distance.",
    "They married or went abroad to foreign countries foreign embassies or taught in foreign schools or took\nup social projects.",
    "Anyway they faded little by little out of your life.",
    "You were pleased to see them if they suddenly as it\nwere floated up on the horizon again.",
    "But you had to remember to think when you had seen them last\nwhose daughters they were what link had led to your being chosen as a godmother.",
    "Celia Ravenscroft said Mrs. Oliver doing her best.",
    "Yes yes of course.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "Not that any\npicture rose before her eyes of Celia Ravenscroft not that is since a very early time.",
    "The christening.",
    "Shed gone to Celias christening and had found a very nice Queen Anne silver strainer as a christening\npresent.",
    "Very nice.",
    "Do nicely for straining milk and would also be the sort of thing a goddaughter could\nalways sell for a nice little sum if she wanted ready money at any time.",
    "Yes she remembered the strainer\nvery well indeed.",
    "Queen AnneSeventeeneleven it had been.",
    "Britannia mark.",
    "How much easier it was\nto remember silver coffeepots or strainers or christening mugs than it was the actual child.",
    "Yes she said yes of course.",
    "Im afraid I havent seen Celia for a very long time now.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "She\nis of course a rather impulsive girl said Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "I mean shes changed her ideas very often.",
    "Of course very intellectual did very well at university but her political notionsI suppose all young\npeople have political notions nowadays Im afraid I dont deal much with politics said Mrs.\n\n\fOliver to whom politics had always been anathema.",
    "You see Im going to confide in you.",
    "Im going to tell you exactly what it is I want to know.",
    "Im sure you\nwont mind.",
    "Ive heard from so many people how kind you are how willing always.",
    "I wonder if shes going to try\nand borrow money from me thought Mrs. Oliver who had known many interviews that began with this\nkind of approach.",
    "You see it is a matter of the greatest moment to me.",
    "Something that I really feel I must find out.",
    "Celia you see is going to marryor thinks she is going to\nmarrymy son Desmond.",
    "Oh indeed said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "At least that is their idea at present.",
    "Of course one has to know about people and theres something I\nwant very much to know.",
    "Its an extraordinary thing to ask anyone and I couldnt gowell I mean I\ncouldnt very well go and ask a stranger but I dont feel you are a stranger dear Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Mrs.\nOliver thought I wish you did.",
    "She was getting nervous now.",
    "She wondered if Celia had had an\nillegitimate baby or was going to have an illegitimate baby and whether she Mrs. Oliver was supposed\nto know about it and give details.",
    "That would be very awkward.",
    "On the other hand thought Mrs. Oliver I havent seen her now for five or\nsix years and she must be about twentyfive or six so it would be quite easy to say I dont know\nanything.",
    "Mrs. BurtonCox leaned forward and breathed hard.",
    "I want you to tell me because Im sure you must know or perhaps have a very good idea how it all\ncame about.",
    "Did her mother kill her father or was it the father who killed the mother Whatever Mrs.\nOliver had expected it was certainly not that.",
    "She stared at Mrs. BurtonCox unbelievingly.",
    "But I dont She stopped.",
    "II cant understand.",
    "I meanwhat reason Dear Mrs. Oliver you must\nknow...",
    "I mean such a famous case... Of course I know its a long time ago now well I suppose\ntentwenty years at least but it did cause a lot of attention at the time.",
    "Im sure youll remember you\nmust remember.",
    "Mrs. Olivers brain was working desperately.",
    "Celia was her goddaughter.",
    "That was\nquite true.",
    "Celias motheryes of course Celias mother had been Molly PrestonGrey who had been a\nfriend of hers though not a particularly intimate one and of course she had married a man in the Army\nyeswhat was his nameSir Something Ravenscroft.",
    "Or was he an ambassador Extraordinary one\ncouldnt remember these things.",
    "She couldnt even remember whether she herself had been Mollys\nbridesmaid.",
    "She thought she had.",
    "Rather a smart wedding at the Guards Chapel or something like that.",
    "But one did forget so.",
    "And after that she hadnt met them for years\u2014theyd been out somewhere\u2014in the\nMiddle East In Persia In Iraq One time in Egypt India Very occasionally when they had been\nvisiting England she met them again.",
    "But theyd been like one of those photographs that one takes and looks at.",
    "One knows the people\nvaguely who are in it but its so faded that you really cant recognize them or remember who they were.",
    "And she couldnt remember now whether Sir Something Ravenscroft and Lady Ravenscroft born Molly\nPreston Grey had entered much into her life.",
    "She didnt think so.",
    "But then... Mrs. BurtonCox was still\nlooking at her.",
    "Looking at her as though disappointed in her lack of savoirfaire her inability to remember\nwhat had evidently been a cause celebre.",
    "Killed You mean\u2014an accident Oh no.",
    "Not an accident.",
    "In one of those houses by the sea.",
    "Cornwall I think.",
    "Somewhere where there were rocks.",
    "Anyway they had a house down there.",
    "And they\nwere both found on the cliff there and theyd been shot you know.",
    "But there was nothing really that the\npolice could tell whether the wife shot the husband and then shot herself or whether the husband shot the\nwife and then shot himself.",
    "They went into the evidence of the\u2014you know\u2014of the bullets and the various\nthings but it was very difficult.",
    "They thought it might be a suicide pact and\u2014I forget what the verdict\nwas.",
    "Something\u2014it could have been misadventure or something like that.",
    "But of course everyone knew it\nmust have been meant and there were a lot of stories that went about of course at the time\u2014\nProbably all invented ones said Mrs. Oliver hopefully trying to remember even one of the stories if she\ncould.",
    "Well maybe.",
    "Maybe.",
    "Its very hard to say I know.",
    "There were tales of a quarrel either that day or\nbefore there was some talk of another man and then of course there was the usual talk about some\nother woman.",
    "And one never knows which way it was about.",
    "I think things were hushed up a good deal\nbecause General Ravenscrofts position was rather a high one and I think it was said that hed been in a\nnursing home that year and hed been very rundown or something and that he really didnt know what he\nwas doing.",
    "Im really afraid said Mrs. Oliver speaking firmly that I must say that I dont know\nanything about it.",
    "I do remember now you mention it that there was such a case and I remember the\nnames and that I knew the people but I never knew what happened or anything at all about it.",
    "And I\nreally dont think I have the least idea... And really thought Mrs. Oliver wishing she was brave enough\nto say it how on earth you have the impertinence to ask me such a thing I dont know.",
    "Its very important that I should know Mrs. BurtonCox said.",
    "Her eyes which were rather like hard marbles started to snap.",
    "Its important you see because of my boy my dear boy wanting to marry Celia.",
    "Im afraid I cant help\nyou said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Ive never heard anything.",
    "But you must know said Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "I\nmean you write these wonderful stories you know all about crime.",
    "You know who commits crimes and\nwhy they do it and Im sure that all sorts of people will tell you the story behind the story as one so\nmuch thinks of these things.",
    "I dont know anything said Mrs. Oliver in a voice which no longer held\nvery much politeness and definitely now spoke in tones of distaste.",
    "But you do see that really one doesnt know who to go to to ask about it I mean one couldnt go to the\npolice after all these years and I dont suppose theyd tell you anyway because obviously they were\ntrying to hush it up.",
    "But I feel its important to get the truth.",
    "I only write books said Mrs. Oliver coldly.",
    "They are entirely fictional.",
    "I know nothing personally about crime and have no opinions on criminology.",
    "So Im afraid I cant help you in any way.",
    "But you could ask your goddaughter.",
    "You could ask Celia.",
    "Ask Celia Mrs. Oliver stared again.",
    "I dont see how I could do that.",
    "She waswhy I think she must\nhave been quite a child when this tragedy happened.",
    "Oh I expect she knew all about it though said\nMrs.\nBurtonCox.",
    "Children always know everything.",
    "And shed tell you.",
    "Im sure shed tell you.",
    "Youd\nbetter ask her yourself I should think said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "I dont think I could really do that said Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "I dont think you know that Desmond would like it.",
    "You know hes ratherwell hes rather touchy where Celia is concerned and I really dont think\nthatnoIm sure shed tell you.",
    "I really shouldnt dream of asking her said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She made a pretence of looking at her watch Oh dear she said what a long time weve been over\nthis delightful lunch I must run now.",
    "I have a very important appointment.",
    "Goodbye\nMrs.erBedleyCox so sorry I cant help you but these things are rather delicate anddoes it really\nmake any difference anyway from your point of view Oh I think it makes all the difference.",
    "At that\nmoment a literary figure whom Mrs. Oliver knew well drifted past.",
    "Mrs. Oliver jumped up to catch her\nby the arm.",
    "Louise my dear how lovely to see you.",
    "I hadnt noticed you were here.",
    "Oh Ariadne its a long time\nsince Ive seen you.",
    "Youve grown a lot thinner havent you What nice things you always say to me\nsaid Mrs. Oliver engaging her friend by the arm and retreating from the settee.",
    "Im rushing away because Ive got an appointment.",
    "I suppose you got tied up with that awful woman\ndidnt you said her friend looking over her shoulder at Mrs.\nBurtonCox.",
    "She was asking me the most extraordinary questions said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Oh.",
    "Didnt you know how to answer them No.",
    "They werent any of my business anyway.",
    "I didnt\nknow anything about them.",
    "Anyway I wouldnt have wanted to answer them.",
    "Was it about anything\ninteresting I suppose said Mrs. Oliver letting a new idea come into her head I suppose it might be\ninteresting only Shes getting up to chase you said her friend.",
    "Come along.",
    "Ill see you get out and\ngive you a lift to anywhere you want to go if you havent got your car here.",
    "I never take my car about in\nLondon its so awful to park.",
    "I know it is.",
    "Absolutely deadly.",
    "Mrs. Oliver made the proper\ngoodbyes.",
    "Thanks words of greatly expressed pleasure and presently was being driven round a\nLondon square.",
    "Eaton Terrace isnt it said the kindly friend.",
    "Yes said Mrs. Oliver but where Ive got to go now isI think its Whitefriars Mansions.",
    "I cant quite\nremember the name of it but I know where it is.",
    "Oh flats.",
    "Rather modern ones.",
    "Very square and\ngeometrical.",
    "Thats right said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "CHAPTER II First Mention Of Elephants\nHaving failed to find her friend Hercule Poirot at home Mrs. Oliver had to resort to a telephone inquiry.",
    "Are you by any chance going to be at home this evening asked Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She sat by her telephone her fingers tapping rather nervously on the table.",
    "Would that be Ariadne Oliver said Mrs. Oliver who was always surprised to find she had to give\nher name because she always expected all her friends to know her voice as soon as they heard it.",
    "Yes I shall be at home all this evening.",
    "Does that mean that I may have the pleasure of a visit from you\n\n\fIts very nice of you to put it that way said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I dont know that it will be such a pleasure.",
    "It is always a pleasure to see you chere madame.",
    "I dont\nknow said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I might be going to well bother you rather.",
    "Ask things.",
    "I want to know what\nyou think about something.",
    "That I am always ready to tell anyone said Poirot.",
    "Somethings come up said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Something tiresome and I dont know what to do about it.",
    "And so you will come and see me.",
    "I am flattered.",
    "Highly flattered.",
    "What time would suit you said\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "Nine oclock We will drink coffee together perhaps unless you prefer a grenadine or a Sirop de\nCassis.",
    "But no you do not like that.",
    "I remember.",
    "George said Poirot to his invaluable manservant\nwe are to receive tonight the pleasure of a visit from Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Coffee I think and perhaps a liqueur of some kind.",
    "I am never sure what she likes.",
    "I have seen her\ndrink kirsch sir.",
    "And also I think a creme de menthe.",
    "But kirsch I think is what she prefers.",
    "Very\nwell then said Poirot.",
    "So be it.",
    "Mrs. Oliver came punctual to time.",
    "Poirot had been wondering while\neating his dinner what it was that was driving Mrs.\nOliver to visit him and why she was so doubtful about what she was doing.",
    "Was she bringing him some\ndifficult problem or was she acquainting him with a crime As Poirot knew well it could be anything with\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "The most commonplace things or the most extraordinary things.",
    "They were as you might\nsay all alike to her.",
    "She was worried he thought.",
    "Ah well Hercule Poirot thought to himself he could deal with Mrs. Oliver.",
    "He always had been able to\ndeal with Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "On occasion she maddened him.",
    "At the same time he was really very much attached to her.",
    "They\nhad shared many experiences and experiments together.",
    "He had read something about her in the paper\nonly that morningor was it the evening paper He must try and remember it before she came.",
    "He had\njust done so when she was announced.",
    "She came into the room and Poirot deduced at once that his diagnosis of worry was true enough.",
    "Her\nhairdo which was fairly elaborate had been ruffled by the fact that she had been running her fingers\nthrough it in the frenzied and fever17 ish way that she did sometimes.",
    "He received her with every sign of\npleasure established her in a chair poured her some coffee and handed her a glass of kirsch.",
    "Ah said Mrs. Oliver with the sigh of someone who has relief.",
    "I expect youre going to think Im awfully\nsilly but still...",
    "I see or rather I saw in the paper that you were attending a literary luncheon today.",
    "Famous women writers.",
    "Something of that kind.",
    "I thought you never did that kind of thing.",
    "I dont\nusually said Mrs. Oliver and I shant ever do it again.",
    "Ah You suffered much Poirot was quite\nsympathetic.",
    "He knew Mrs. Olivers embarrassing moments.",
    "Extravagant praise of her books always upset her highly\nbecause as she had once told him she never knew the proper answers.",
    "You did not enjoy it Up to a point I did said Mrs. Oliver and then something very tiresome\nhappened.",
    "Ah.",
    "And that is what you have come to see me about.",
    "Yes but I really dont know why.",
    "I\nmean its nothing to do with you and I dont think its the sort of thing youd even be interested in.",
    "And\nIm not really interested in it.",
    "At least I suppose I must be or I wouldnt have wanted to come to you to\nknow what you thought.",
    "To know whatwell what youd do if you were me.",
    "That is a very difficult\n\n\fquestion that last one said Poirot.",
    "I know how I Hercule Poirot would act in anything but I do not know how you would act well though\nI know you.",
    "You must have some idea by this time said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Youve known me long enough.",
    "About whattwenty years now Oh I dont know.",
    "I can never\nremember what years are what dates are.",
    "You know I get mixed up.",
    "I know nineteen thirtynine\nbecause thats when the war started and I know other dates because of queer things here and there.",
    "Anyway you went to your literary luncheon.",
    "And you did not enjoy it very much.",
    "I enjoyed the lunch\nbut it was afterwards... People said things to you said Poirot with the kindliness of a doctor\ndemanding symptoms.",
    "Well they were just getting ready to say things to me.",
    "Suddenly one of those large bossy women who always manage to dominate everyone and who can\nmake you feel more uncomfortable than anyone else descended on me.",
    "You know like somebody who\ncatches a butterfly or something only shed have needed a butterfly net.",
    "She sort of rounded me.",
    "up and\npushed me on to a settee and then she began to talk to me starting about a goddaughter of mine.",
    "Ah\nyes.",
    "A goddaughter you are fond of I havent seen her for a good many years said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "I cant keep up with all of them I mean.",
    "And then she asked me a most worrying question.",
    "She\nwanted meoh dear how very difficult it is for me to tell this No it isnt said Poirot kindly.",
    "It is\nquite easy.",
    "Everyone tells everything to me sooner or later.",
    "Im only a foreigner you see so it does not\nmatter.",
    "It is easy because I am a foreigner.",
    "Well it is rather easy to say things to you said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "You see she asked me about the girls father and mother.",
    "She asked me whether her mother had\nkilled her father or her father had killed her mother I beg your pardon said Poirot.",
    "Oh I know it sounds mad.",
    "Well I thought it was mad.",
    "Whether your goddaughters mother had killed\nher father or whether her father had killed her mother.",
    "Thats right said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Butwas that a matter of fact Had her father killed her mother or her mother killed her father Well\nthey were both found shot said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "On the top of a cliff.",
    "I cant remember if it was in Cornwall\nor in Corsica.",
    "Something like that.",
    "It was true then what she said Oh yes that part of it was true.",
    "It\nhappened years ago.",
    "Well but I mean\u2014why come to me All because you were a crime writer said Poirot.",
    "She no doubt\nsaid you knew all about crime.",
    "This was a real thing that happened Oh yes.",
    "It wasnt something like\nwhat would A do\u2014or what would be the proper procedure if your mother had killed your father or your\nfather had killed your mother.",
    "No it was something that really happened.",
    "I suppose really Id better tell\nyou all about it.",
    "I mean I cant remember all about it but it was quite well known at the time.",
    "It was\nabout\u2014oh I should think it was about twenty years ago at least.",
    "And as I say I can remember the\nnames of the people because I did know them.",
    "The wife had been at school with me and Id known her\nquite well.",
    "Wed been friends.",
    "It was a wellknown case\u2014you know it was in all the papers and things\nlike that.",
    "Sir Alistair Ravenscroft and Lady Ravenscroft.",
    "A very happy couple and he was a colonel or a general\nand shed been with him and theyd been all over the world.",
    "Then they bought this house somewhere\u2014I\nthink it was abroad but I cant remember.",
    "And then there were suddenly accounts of this case in the\npapers.",
    "Whether somebody else had killed them or whether theyd been assassinated or something or\nwhether they killed each other.",
    "I think it was a revolver that had been in the house for ages and\u2014well Id\n\n\fbetter tell you as much as I can remember.",
    "Pulling herself slightly together Mrs. Oliver managed to give\nPoirot a more or less clear resume of what she had been told.",
    "Poirot from time to time checked on a\npoint here or there.",
    "But why he said finally why should this woman want to know this Well thats what I want to find\nout said Mrs. Oliver I could get hold of Celia I think.",
    "I mean she still lives in London.",
    "Or perhaps its\nCambridge she lives in or Oxford.",
    "I think shes got a degree and either lectures here or teaches\nsomewhere or does something like that.",
    "Andvery modern you know.",
    "Goes about with longhaired\npeople in queer clothes.",
    "I dont think she takes drugs.",
    "Shes quite all right andjust very occasionally I hear from her.",
    "I mean she\nsends a card at Christmas and things like that.",
    "Well one doesnt think of ones godchildren all the time\nand shes quite twentyfive or six.",
    "Not married No.",
    "Apparently she is going to marryor that is the idea Mrs.whats the name of\nthat woman againoh yes Mrs.\nBrittlenoBurtonCoxs son.",
    "And Mrs. BurtonCox does not want her son to marry this girl because\nher father killed her mother or her mother killed her father Well I suppose so said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Its\nthe only thing I can think.",
    "But what does it matter which If one of your parents killed the other would it\nreally matter to the mother of the boy you were going to marry which way round it was That is a thing\none might have to think about said Poirot.",
    "It isyes you know it is quite interesting.",
    "I do not mean it is\nvery interesting about Sir Alistair Ravenscroft or Lady Ravenscroft.",
    "I seem to remember vaguelyoh\nsome case like this one or it might not have been the same one.",
    "But it is very strange about Mrs.\nBurtonCox.",
    "Perhaps she is a bit touched in the head.",
    "Is she very fond of her son Probably said\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "Probably she doesnt want him to marry this girl at all.",
    "Because she may have inherited a\npredisposition to murder the man she marriesor something of that kind How do I know said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "She seems to think that I can tell her and shes really not told me enough has she But why do\nyou think Whats behind it all What does it mean It would be most interesting to find out said\nPoirot.",
    "Well thats why Ive come to you said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You like finding out things.",
    "Things that you cant\nsee the reason for at first.",
    "I mean that nobody can see the reason for.",
    "Do you think Mrs BurtonCox\nhas any preference said Poirot.",
    "You mean that shed rather the husband killed the wife or the wife killed the husband I dont think so.",
    "Well said Poirot I see your dilemma.",
    "It is very intriguing.",
    "You come home from a party.",
    "Youve been asked to do something that is very difficult almost\nimpossible andyou wonder what is the proper way to deal with such a thing.",
    "Well what would you\nthink is the proper way said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "It is not easy for me to say said Poirot.",
    "Im not a woman.",
    "A woman whom you do not really know\nwhom you had met at a party has put this problem to you asked you to do it giving no discernible\nreason.",
    "Right said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Now what does Ariadne do\nWhat does A do in other words if you were reading this as a problem in a newspaper Well I\nsuppose said Poirot there are three things that A could do.",
    "A could write a note to Mrs. BurtonCox\nand say Im very sorry but I really feel I cannot oblige you in this matter or whatever words you like to\n\n\fput.",
    "B.",
    "You get in touch with your goddaughter and you tell her what has been asked of you by the\nmother of the boy or the young man or whatever he is whom she is thinking of marrying.",
    "You will find\nout from her if she is really thinking of marrying this young man.",
    "If so whether she has any idea or\nwhether the young man has said anything to her about what his mother has got in her head.",
    "And there will\nbe other interesting points like finding out what this girl thinks of the mother of the young man she wants\nto marry.",
    "The third thing you could do said Poirot and this really is what I firmly advise you to do is...",
    "I know said Mrs. Oliver one word.",
    "Nothing said Poirot.",
    "Exactly said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I know that is the simple and proper thing to do.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Its darned cheek\nto go and tell a girl whos my goddaughter what her future motherinlaw is going about saying and asking\npeople.",
    "But I know said Poirot it is human curiosity.",
    "I want to know why that odious woman\ncame and said what she did to me said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Once I knew that I could relax and forget all\nabout it.",
    "But until I know that...",
    "Yes said Poirot you wont sleep.",
    "Youll wake up in the night and if I\nknow you you will have the most extraordinary and extravagant ideas which presently probably you\nwill be able to make into a most attractive crime story.",
    "A whodunita thriller.",
    "All sorts of things.",
    "Well I\nsuppose I could if I thought of it that way said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Her eyes flashed slightly.",
    "Leave it alone said Poirot.",
    "It will be a very difficult plot to undertake.",
    "It seems as though there could\nbe no good reason for this.",
    "But Id like to make sure that there is no good reason.",
    "Human curiosity\nsaid Poirot.",
    "Such a very interesting thing.",
    "He sighed.",
    "To think what we owe to it throughout history.",
    "Curiosity.",
    "I dont know who invented curiosity.",
    "It is said to be usually associated with the cat.",
    "Curiosity\nkilled the cat.",
    "But I should say really that the Greeks were the inventors of curiosity.",
    "They wanted to\nknow.",
    "Before them as far as I can see nobody wanted to know much.",
    "They just wanted to know what\nthe rules of the country they were living in were and how they could avoid having their heads cut off or\nbeing impaled on spikes or something disagreeable happening to them.",
    "But they either obeyed or\ndisobeyed.",
    "They didnt want to know why.",
    "But since then a lot of people have wanted to know why and\nall sorts of things have happened because of that.",
    "Boats trains flying machines and atom bombs and\npenicillin and cures for various illnesses.",
    "A little boy watches his mothers kettle raising its lid because of\nthe steam.",
    "And the next thing we know is we have railway trains leading on in due course to railway\nstrikes and all that.",
    "And so on and so on.",
    "Just tell me said Mrs. Oliver do you think Im a terrible\nnoseyparker No I dont said Poirot.",
    "On the whole I dont think you are a woman of great\ncuriosity.",
    "But I can quite see you getting in a hetup state at a literary party busy defending yourself\nagainst too much kindness too much praise.",
    "You ran yourself instead into a very awkward dilemma and\ntook a very strong dislike to the person who ran you into it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Shes a very tiresome woman a very\ndisagreeable woman.",
    "This murder in the past of this husband and wife who were supposed to get on\nwell together and no apparent sign of a quarrel was known.",
    "One never really read about any cause for it\naccording to you They were shot.",
    "Yes they were shot.",
    "It could have been a suicide pact.",
    "I think the\npolice thought it was at first.",
    "Of course one cant find out about things all those years afterwards.",
    "Oh\nyes said Poirot I think I could find out something about it.",
    "You meanthrough the exciting friends\nyouve got Well I wouldnt say the exciting friends perhaps.",
    "Certainly there are knowledgeable\nfriends friends who could get certain records look up the accounts that were given of the crime at the\ntime some access I could get to certain records.",
    "You could find out things said Mrs. Oliver hopefully\nand then tell me.",
    "Yes said Poirot I think I could help you to know at any rate the full facts of the\ncase.",
    "Itll take a little time though.",
    "I can see that if you do that which is what I want you to do Ive got\nto do something myself.",
    "Ill have to see the girl.",
    "Ive got to see whether she knows anything about all this ask her if shed like me to give her\nmotherinlawtobe a raspberry or whether there is any other way in which I can help her.",
    "And Id like to see the boy shes going to marry too.",
    "Quite right said Poirot.",
    "Excellent.",
    "And I\nsuppose said Mrs. Oliver there might be people\u2014 She broke off frowning.",
    "I dont suppose people will be very much good said Hercule Poirot.",
    "This is an affair of the past.",
    "A\ncause celebre perhaps at the time.",
    "But what is a cause celebre when you come to think of it Unless it\ncomes to an astonishing denouement which this one didnt.",
    "Nobody remembers it.",
    "No said Mrs.\nOliver that is quite true.",
    "There was a lot about it in the papers and mentions of it for some time and then\nit just\u2014faded out.",
    "Well like things do now.",
    "Like that girl the other day.",
    "You know who left her home\nand they couldnt find her anywhere.",
    "Well I mean that was five or six years ago and then suddenly a little\nboy playing about in a sand heap or a gravel pit or something suddenly came across her dead body.",
    "Five or six years later.",
    "That is true said Poirot.",
    "And it is true that knowing from the body how long it\nis since death and what happened on the particular day and going back over various events of which\nthere is a written record one may in the end turn up a murderer.",
    "But it will be more difficult in your\nproblem since it seems the answer must be one of two things that the husband disliked his wife and\nwanted to get rid of her or that the wife hated her husband or else had a lover.",
    "Therefore it might have\nbeen a passionate crime or something quite different.",
    "Anyway there would be nothing as it were to find\nout about it.",
    "If the police could not find out at the time then the motive must have been a difficult one not\neasy to see.",
    "Therefore it has remained a nine days wonder that is all.",
    "T suppose I can go to the daughter.",
    "Perhaps\nthat is what t 25 that odious woman was getting me to dowanted me to do.",
    "She thought the daughter knewwell the daughter might have known said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Children do\nyou know.",
    "They know the most extraordinary things.",
    "Have you any idea how old this goddaughter of\nyours would have been at the time Well I have if I reckon it up but I cant say offhand.",
    "I think she\nmight have been nine or ten but perhaps older I dont know.",
    "I think that she was away at school at the\ntime.",
    "But that may be just my fancy remembering back what I read.",
    "But you think Mrs. BurtonCoxs wish\nwas to make you get information from the daughter Perhaps the daughter knows something perhaps\nshe said something to the son and the son said something to his mother.",
    "I expect Mrs. BurtonCox tried\nto question the girl herself and got rebuffed but thought the famous Mrs. Oliver being both a godmother\nand also full of criminal knowledge might obtain information.",
    "Though why it should matter to her I still dont see said Poirot.",
    "And it does not seem to me that what\nyou call vaguely people can help after all this time He added Would anybody remember Well\nthats where I think they might said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You surprise me said Poirot looking at her with a somewhat puzzled face.",
    "Do people remember\nWell said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I was really thinking of elephants.",
    "Elephants As he had thought often\nbefore Poirot thought that really Mrs. Oliver was the most unaccountable woman.",
    "Why suddenly\nelephants\nI was thinking of elephants at the lunch yesterday said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Why were you thinking of elephants said Poirot with some curiosity.",
    "Well I was really thinking of teeth.",
    "You know things one tries to eat and if youve got some sort of\nfalse teeth\u2014well you cant do it very well.",
    "You know youve got to know what you can eat and what\nyou cant.",
    "Ah said Poirot with a deep sigh.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "The dentists they can do much for you but not\neverything.",
    "Quite so.",
    "And then I thought of\u2014you know\u2014our teeth being only bone and so not awfully\ngood and how nice it would be to be a dog who has really ivory teeth.",
    "And then I thought of anyone\nelse who has ivory teeth and I thought about walruses and\u2014oh other things like that.",
    "And I thought\n\n\fabout elephants.",
    "Of course when you think of ivory you do think of elephants dont you Great big\nelephant tusks.",
    "That is very true said Poirot still not seeing the point of what Mrs. Oliver was saying.",
    "So I thought that what weve really got to do is to get at the people who are like elephants.",
    "Because\nelephants so they say dont forget.",
    "I have heard the phrase yes said Poirot.",
    "Elephants dont forget said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You know a story children get brought up on How\nsomeone an Indian tailor stuck a needle or something in an elephants tusk.",
    "No.",
    "Not a tusk his trunk of course an elephants trunk.",
    "And the next time the elephant came past he had a\ngreat mouthful of water and he splashed it out all over the tailor though he hadnt seen him for several\nyears.",
    "He hadnt forgotten.",
    "He remembered.",
    "Thats the point you see.",
    "Elephants remember.",
    "What Ive got to do is\u2014Ive got to get in touch with some elephants.",
    "I do not know yet if I quite see\nwhat you mean said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Who are you classifying as elephants You sound as though you\nwere going for information to the zoo.",
    "Well its not exactly like that said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Not elephants\nas elephants but the way people up to a point would resemble elephants.",
    "There are some people who\ndo remember.",
    "In fact one does remember queer things.",
    "I mean there are a lot of things that I remember\nvery well.",
    "They happenedI remember a birthday party I had when I was five and a pink cakea lovely\npink cake.",
    "It had a sugar bird on it.",
    "And I remember the day my canary flew away and I cried.",
    "And I\nremember another day when I went into a field and there was a bull there and somebody said it would\ngore me and I was terrified and wanted to run out of the field.",
    "Well I remember that quite well.",
    "It was a Tuesday too.",
    "I dont know why I should remember it was a\nTuesday but it was a Tuesday.",
    "And I remember a wonderful picnic with blackberries.",
    "I remember\ngetting pricked terribly but getting more blackberries than anyone else.",
    "It was wonderful By that time I\nwas nine I think.",
    "But one neednt go back as far as that.",
    "I mean Ive been to hundreds of weddings in\nmy life but when I look back on a wedding there are only two that I remember particularly.",
    "One where I\nwas a bridesmaid.",
    "It took place in the New Forest I remember and I cant remember who was there\nactually.",
    "I think it was a cousin of mine getting married.",
    "I didnt know her very well but she wanted a\ngood many bridesmaids and well I came in handy I suppose.",
    "But I know another wedding.",
    "That was a friend of mine in the Navy.",
    "He was nearly drowned in a\nsubmarine and then he was saved again and then the girl he was engaged to her people didnt want her\nto marry him but then he did marry her after that and I was one other bridesmaids at the marriage.",
    "Well I mean theres always things you do remember.",
    "I see your point said Poirot.",
    "I find it interesting.",
    "So you will go a la recherche des elephants Thats right.",
    "Id have to get the date right.",
    "There said\nPoirot I hope I may be able to help you.",
    "And then Ill think of people I knew about at that time\npeople that I may have known who also knew the same friends that I did who probably knew General\nWhatnot.",
    "People who may have known them abroad but whom I also knew although I maynt have\nseen them for a good many years.",
    "You can look up people you know that you havent seen for a long\ntime.",
    "Because people are always quite pleased to see someone coming up out of the past even if they\ncant remember very much about you.",
    "And then you naturally will talk about the things that were\nhappening at that date that you remember about.",
    "Very interesting said Poirot.",
    "I think you are very\nwell equipped for what you propose to do.",
    "People who knew the Ravenscrofts either well or not very\nwell people who lived in the same part of the world where the thing happened or who might have been\nstaying there.",
    "More difficult but I think one could get at it.",
    "And so somehow or other one would try\ndifferent things.",
    "Start a little talk going about what happened what they think happened what anyone\nelse has ever told you about what might have happened.",
    "About any love affairs the husband or wife had\nabout any money that somebody might have inherited.",
    "I think you could scratch up a lot of things.",
    "Oh\n\n\fdear said Mrs. Oliver Im afraid really Im just a noseyparker.",
    "Youve been given an assignment\nsaid Poirot not by someone you like not by someone you wish to oblige but someone you entirely\ndislike.",
    "That does not matter.",
    "You are still on a quest\u2014a quest of knowledge.",
    "You take your own path.",
    "It is the path of the elephants.",
    "The elephants may remember.",
    "Bow voyage said Poirot.",
    "I beg your pardon said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Im sending you forth on your voyage of discovery said Poirot.",
    "A la recherche des elephants.",
    "I\nexpect Im mad said Mrs. Oliver sadly.",
    "She brushed her hands through her hair again so that she looked\nlike the old picture books of Struwelpeter.",
    "I was just thinking of starting a story about a golden retriever.",
    "But it wasnt going well.",
    "I couldnt get started if you know what I mean.",
    "All right abandon the golden\nretriever.",
    "Concern yourself only with elephants.",
    "Book One Elephants\nCHAPTER III Great Aunt Alices Guide To Knowledge\nCan you find my address book for me Miss Livingstone Its on your desk Mrs. Oliver.",

    "Mrs. Olivers first dialing was not successful.",

    "You know\nthe one thats broken a bit.",
    "See if you can find some more address books.",
    "Early ones.",

    "It is astonishing really how many people one does remember when one comes to look up names.",
    "My\nword the silly things they write in birthday books sometimes too.",
    "I cant think why when I was about\nsixteen or seventeen or even thirty I wanted people to write in my birthday book.",

    "Frightening In what way What I mean is\nthat she was more likely to bully me than I would be to bully her.",
    "That may be a good thing and not a\nbad thing.",
    "Oh do you think so If people have made up their minds that they do not wish to like you\nthat they are quite sure they do not like you they will get more pleasure out of making you aware of the\nfact and in that way will release more information to you than they would have done if they were trying to\nbe amiable and agreeable.",
    "Sucking up to me you mean Yes you have something there.",
    "You mean\nthen they tell you things that they thought would please you.",
    "And the other way theyd be annoyed with\nyou and theyd say things that theyd hope would annoy you.",

    "Like sherry or something else No.",
    "Id like sherry.",
    "There you are then.",
    "I suppose it seems rather\nodd to you said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "My ringing you up suddenly like this.",
    "Oh no I dont know that it does\nparticularly.",
    "Im not a very conscientious godmother Im afraid Why should you be at my age\nYoure right there said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Ones duties one feels end at a certain time.",
    "Not that I ever really\nfulfilled mine.",
    "I dont remember coming to your confirmation.",
    "I believe the duty of a godmother is to\nmake you learn your catechism and a few things like that isnt it Renounce the devil and all his works in\nmy name said Celia.",
    "A faint humorous smile came to her lips.",
    "She was being very amiable but all the same thought Mrs.\nOliver shes rather a dangerous girl in some ways.",
    "Well Ill tell you why Ive been trying to get hold of you said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "The whole thing is rather\npeculiar.",
    "I dont often go out to literary parties but as it happened I did go out to one the day before\nyesterday.",
    "Yes I know said Celia.",
    "I saw mention of it in the paper and you had your name in it too\nMrs. Ariadne Oliver and I rather wondered because I know you dont usually go to those sort of things.",
    "No said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I rather wish I hadnt gone to that one.",
    "Didnt you enjoy it Yes I did in a\nway because I hadnt been to one before.",

    "Sounds intriguing said Celia and sipped her sherry.",
    "There was a woman there who came and spoke to me.",
    "I didnt know her and she didnt know me.",
    "Still I suppose that often happens to you said Celia.",
    "Yes invariably said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Its one of the\u2014hazards of literary life.",
    "People come up to you and\nsay I do love your books so much and Im so pleased to be able to meet you.",
    "That sort of thing.",
    "I\nwas secretary to a writer once.",
    "I do know about that sort of thing and how difficult it is.",
    "Yes well there\nwas some of that too but that I was prepared for.",
    "And then this woman came up to me and she said T\nbelieve you have a goddaughter called Celia Ravenscroft.",
    "Well that was a bit odd said Celia.",
    "Just\ncoming up to you and saying that.",

    "I cant see quite what youre leading into.",
    "Well said\nMrs. Oliver I hope you wont be angry with me.",

    "Youve aroused my curiosity said Celia.",
    "Her name she mentioned to me.",

    "Oh yes.",
    "She is a particularly odious woman.",
    "And are you going to marry her son\nWell weve considered the question.",
    "I dont know.",

    "That they were found there both of them shot.",
    "There was a\nrevolver lying there.",
    "It belonged to my father.",
    "He had had two revolvers in the house it seems.",
    "There\nwas nothing to say whether it was a suicide pact or whether my father killed my mother and then shot\nhimself or my mother shot my father and then killed herself.",
    "But perhaps you know all this already.",

    "With friends of course very often you have some idea of what led to\u2014whatever the incident might be.",

    "Always questioning and\nasking things and wanting to know all about you.",
    "You never asked questions.",
    "You used to take me out to\nshows or give me nice meals and talk to me as though well as though everything was all right and you\nwere just a distant relation of the family.",
    "Ive appreciated that.",
    "Ive known so many noseyparkers in my\nlife.",
    "Yes.",
    "Everyone comes up against that sooner or later said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "But you see now what\nupset me at this particular party.",
    "It seems an extraordinary thing to be asked to do by a complete\nstranger like Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "I couldnt imagine why she should want to know.",
    "It was no business of\nhers surely.",
    "Unless You thought it was unless it was something to do with my marrying Desmond.",
    "Desmond is her son Yes I suppose it could have been but I couldnt see how or what business it was\nof hers.",
    "Everythings her business.",
    "Shes noseyin fact shes what you said she was an odious woman.",
    "But I gather Desmond isnt odious.",
    "No.",
    "No Im very fond of Desmond and Desmond is fond of me.",
    "I\ndont like his mother.",
    "Does he like his mother I dont really know said Celia.",
    "I suppose he might\nlike heranythings possible isnt it Anyway I dont want to get married at present.",
    "I dont feel like it.",
    "And there are a lot ofoh well difficulties you know there are a lot of fors and againsts.",
    "It must have\nmade you feel rather curious said Celia.",
    "I mean why Mrs. Nosey Cox should have asked you to try\nand worm things out of me and then run along and spill it all to her Are you asking me that particular\nquestion by the way You mean am I asking you whether you think or know that your mother killed\nyour father or your father killed your mother or whether it was a double suicide  Is that what you\n\n\fmean Well I suppose it is in a way.",
    "But I think I have to ask you also if you were wanting to ask me\nthat whether you were doing so with the idea of giving Mrs. BurtonCox the information you obtained in\ncase you did receive any information from me.",
    "No said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Quite decidedly no.",
    "I shouldnt\ndream of telling the odious woman anything of the sort.",
    "I shall tell her quite firmly that it is not any\nbusiness of hers or of mine and that I have no intention of obtaining information from you and retailing it\nto her.",
    "Well thats what I thought said Celia.",
    "I thought I could trust you to that extent.",
    "I dont mind\ntelling you what I do know.",
    "Such as it is.",
    "You neednt.",
    "Im not asking you for it.",
    "No.",
    "I can quite see\nthat.",
    "But Ill give you the answer all the same.",
    "The answer isnothing.",
    "Nothing said Mrs. Oliver\nthoughtfully.",
    "No.",
    "I wasnt there at the time.",
    "I mean I wasnt in the house at the time.",
    "I cant remember now quite\nwhere I was.",
    "I think I was at school in Switzerland or else I was staying with a school friend during the\nschool holidays.",
    "You see its all rather mixed up in my mind by now.",
    "I suppose said Mrs. Oliver\ndoubtfully it wouldnt be likely that you would know.",
    "Considering your age at the time.",
    "Id be\ninterested said Celia to know just what you feel about that.",
    "Do you think it would be likely for me to\nknow all about it Or not to know Well you said you werent in the house.",
    "If youd been in the house\nat the time then yes I think it would be quite likely that you might know something.",
    "Children do.",
    "Teenagers do.",
    "People of that age know a lot they see a lot they dont talk about it very often.",
    "But they\ndo know things that the outside world wouldnt know and they do know things that they wouldnt be\nwilling shall we say to tell to police inquirers.",
    "No.",
    "Youre being quite sensible.",
    "I wouldntve known.",
    "I\ndont think I did know.",
    "I dont think I had any idea.",
    "What did the police think You dont mind my asking\nyou that I hope because I should be interested.",
    "You see I never read any account of the inquest or\nanything like that or the inquiry into it.",
    "I think they thought it was a double suicide but I dont think they\never had any inkling as to the reason for it.",
    "Do you want to know what I think Not if you dont want\nme to know said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "But I expect you are interested.",
    "After all you write crime stories about people who kill themselves or kill\neach other or who have reasons for things.",
    "I should think you would be interested.",
    "Yes Ill admit that\nsaid Mrs. Oliver.",
    "But the last thing I want to do is to offend you by seeking for information which is no\nbusiness of mine to know.",
    "Well I wondered said Celia.",
    "Ive often wondered from time to time why\nand how but I knew very little about things.",
    "I mean about how things were going on at home.",
    "The\nholidays before that I had been away on exchange on the continent so I hadnt seen my mother and\nfather really very recently.",
    "I mean theyd come out to Switzerland and taken me out from school once or\ntwice but that was all.",
    "They seemed much as usual but they seemed older.",
    "My father I think was ailing.",
    "I mean getting feebler.",
    "I dont know if it was heart or what it was.",
    "One doesnt really think about that.",
    "My mother too she was going rather nervy.",
    "Not hypochondriac but a little inclined to fuss over her\nhealth.",
    "They were on good terms quite friendly.",
    "There wasnt anything that I noticed.",
    "Only sometimes\none would well sometimes one gets ideas.",
    "One doesnt think theyre true or necessarily right at all but\none just wonders if\u2014 I dont think wed better talk about it any more said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "We dont\nneed to know or find out.",
    "The whole things over and done with.",
    "The verdict was quite satisfactory.",
    "No means to show or motive or anything like that.",
    "But there was no question of your father having\ndeliberately killed your mother or of your mother having deliberately killed your father.",
    "If I thought\nwhich was most likely said Celia I would think my father killed my mother.",
    "Because you see its more\nnatural for a man to shoot anyone I think.",
    "To shoot a woman for whatever reason it was.",
    "I dont think a\nwoman or a woman like my mother would be so likely to shoot my father.",
    "If she wanted him dead I should think she might have chosen some other method.",
    "But I dont think either\nof them wanted the other one dead.",
    "So it could have been an outsider.",
    "Yes but what does one mean\nby an outsider said Celia.",
    "Who else was there living in the house A housekeeper elderly rather blind and rather deaf a foreign\ngirl an au pair girl shed been my governess once she was awfully niceshe came back to look after\nmy mother who had been in hospital And there was an aunt whom I never loved much.",
    "I dont think\nany of them could have been likely to have any grudge against my parents.",
    "There was nobody who\nprofited by their deaths except I suppose myself and my brother Edward who was four years younger\nthan I was.",
    "We inherited what money there was but it wasnt very much.",
    "My father had his pension of\ncourse.",
    "My mother had a small income of her own.",
    "No.",
    "There was nothing there of any importance.",
    "Im\nsorry said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Im sorry if Ive distressed you by asking all this.",
    "You havent distressed me.",
    "Youve brought it up in my mind a little and it has interested me.",
    "Because you see I am of an age now\nthat I wish I did know.",
    "I knew and was fond of them as one is fond of parents.",
    "Not passionately just\nnormally but I realize I dont know what they were really like.",
    "What their life was like.",
    "What mattered to\nthem.",
    "I dont know anything about it all.",
    "I wish I did know.",
    "Its like a burr something sticking into you\nand you cant leave it alone.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would like to know.",
    "Because then you see I shouldnt have to think about it any more.",
    "So you do\nThink about it Celia looked at her for a moment.",
    "She seemed to be trying to come to a decision.",
    "Yes she said I think about it nearly all the time.",
    "Im getting to have a thing about it if you know what I\nmean.",
    "And Desmond feels the same.",
    "CHAPTER V Old Sins Have Long Shadows\nHelercule Poirot let the revolving door wind him round.",
    "Arresting the swing of it with one hand he stepped forward into the small restaurant.",
    "There were not\nmany people there.",
    "It was an unfashionable time of day but his eyes soon saw the man he had come to meet.",
    "The square\nsolid bulk of Superintendent Spence rose from the table in one corner.",
    "Good he said.",
    "You have arrived here.",
    "You had no difficulty in finding it None at all.",
    "Your\ninstructions were most adequate Let me introduce you now.",
    "This is Chief Superintendent Garroway.",
    "Monsieur Hercule Poirot.",
    "Garroway was a tall thin man with a lean ascetic face gray hair which left a\nsmall round spot like a tonsure so that he had a faint resemblance to an ecclesiastic.",
    "This is wonderful said Poirot.",
    "I am retired now of course said Garroway but one remembers.",
    "Yes certain things one remembers\nalthough they are past and gone and the general public probably remembers nothing about them.",
    "But\nyes.",
    "Hercule Poirot very nearly said Elephants do remember but checked himself in time.",
    "That phrase\nwas so associated in his mind now with Mrs. Ariadne Oliver that he found it difficult to restrain it from his\ntongue in many clearly unsuitable categories.",
    "I hope you have not been getting impatient said Superintendent Spence.",
    "He pulled forward a chair and the three men sat down.",
    "A menu was brought.",
    "Superintendent Spence\nwho was clearly addicted to this particular restaurant offered tentative words of advice.",
    "Garroway and\nPoirot made their choice.",
    "Then leaning back a little in their chairs and sipping glasses of sherry they\ncontemplated each other for some minutes in silence before speaking.",
    "I must apologize to you said Poirot I really must apologize to you for coming to you with my demands\nabout an affair which is over and done with.",
    "What interests me said Spence is what has interested\nyou.",
    "I thought first that it was unlike you to have this wish to delve in the past.",
    "Is it connected with\nsomething that has occurred nowadays or is it sudden curiosity about a rather inexplicable perhaps\ncase Do you agree with that He looked across the table.",
    "Inspector Garroway he said as he was at that time was the officer in charge of the investigations into\nthe Ravenscroft shooting.",
    "He was an old friend of mine and so I had no difficulty in getting in touch with\nhim.",
    "And he was kind enough to come here today said Poirot simply because I must admit to a\ncuriosity which I am sure I have no right to feel about an affair that is past and done with.",
    "Well I\nwouldnt say that said Garroway.",
    "We all have interests in certain cases that are past.",
    "Did Lizzie Borden\nreally kill her father and mother with an ax There are people who still do not think so.",
    "Who killed\nCharles Bravo and why There are several different ideas mostly not very well founded.",
    "But still people\ntry to find alternative explanations.",
    "His keen shrewd eyes looked across at Poirot.",
    "And Monsieur Poirot if I am not mistaken has occasionally shown a leaning towards looking into cases\ngoing back shall we say for murder back into the past twice perhaps three times.",
    "Three times\ncertainly said Superintendent Spence.",
    "Once I think I am right by request of a Canadian girl.",
    "That is so said Poirot.",
    "A Canadian girl very\nvehement very passionate very forceful who had come here to investigate a murder for which her\nmother had been condemned to death although she died before sentence was carried out.",
    "Her daughter\nwas convinced that her mother had been innocent.",
    "And you agreed said Garroway.",
    "I did not agree said Poirot when she first told me of the matter.",
    "But she was very vehement and very\nsure.",
    "It was natural for a daughter to wish her mother to have been innocent and to try and prove\nagainst all appearances that she was mhocent said Spence.",
    "It was just a little more than that said Poirot.",
    "She convinced me of the type of woman her mother\nwas.",
    "A woman incapable of murder No said Poirot it would be very difficult and I am sure both\nof you agree with me to think there is anyone quite incapable of murder if one knows what kind of\nperson they are what led up to it.",
    "But in that particular case the mother never protested her innocence.",
    "She appeared to be quite content to be sentenced.",
    "That was curious to begin with.",
    "Was she a defeatist\nIt did not seem so.",
    "When I began to inquire it became clear that she was not a defeatist.",
    "She was one\nwould say almost the opposite of it.",
    "Garroway looked interested.",
    "He leaned across the table twisting a\nbit of bread off the roll on his plate.",
    "And was she innocent Yes.",
    "said Poirot.",
    "She was innocent.",
    "And that surprised you Not by the\ntime I realized it said Poirot.",

    "Yes that is very true.",

    "This trout is\ndelicious he added with appreciation.",

    "In the case of Mrs. McGinty.",
    "Yes.",
    "You werent satisfied said Poirot when that extremely difficult young man was arrested.",
    "He had every\nreason for doing it he looked as though he had done it everyone thought he had done it.",
    "But you knew\nhe hadnt done it.",
    "You were so sure of it that you came to me and told me to go along to see what I\ncould find out.",
    "See if you could help\u2014and you did help didnt you said Spence.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "Fortunately yes.",
    "But what a tiresome young man he was.",
    "If ever a young man deserved to be hung not because he had done a murder but because he wouldnt\nhelp anyone to prove fhat he hadnt.",
    "Now we have the Ravenscroft case.",
    "You say Superintendent\nGarroway something was wrong Yes I felt quite sure of it if you understand what I mean.",
    "I do\nunderstand said Poirot.",
    "And so does Spence.",
    "One does come across these things sometimes.",
    "The\nproofs are there the motive the opportunity the clues the wise en scene its all there.",
    "A complete\nblueprint as you might say.",
    "But all the same those whose profession it is know.",
    "They know that its all wrong just like a critic in the\nartistic world knows when a picture is all wrong.",
    "Knows when its a fake and not the real thing.",
    "There\nwasnt anything I could do about it either said Superintendent Garroway.",
    "I looked into it around it up\nabove it and down below it as you might say.",
    "I talked to the people.",
    "There was nothing there.",
    "It looked\nlike a suicide pact it had all the marks of the suicide pact.",
    "Alternatively of course it could be a husband\nwho shot a wife and then himself or a wife who shot her husband and then herself.",
    "All those three things\nhappen.",
    "When one comes across them one knows they have happened.",
    "But in most cases one has some\nidea of why.",
    "There wasnt any real idea of why in this case was that it said Poirot.",
    "Yes.",
    "Thats it.",
    "You see the moment you begin to inquire into a case to inquire about people and things\nyou get a very good picture as a rule of what their lives have been like.",
    "This was a couple aging the\nhusband with a good record a wife affectionate pleasant on good terms together.",
    "Thats a thing one\nsoon finds out about.",
    "They were happy living together.",
    "They went for walks they played picquet and poker patience with each other in the evenings.",
    "They had\nchildren who caused them no particular anxiety.",
    "A boy in school in England and a girl in a pensionnat in\nSwitzerland.",
    "There was nothing wrong with their lives as far as one could tell.",
    "From such medical\nevidence as one could obtain there was nothing definitely wrong with their health.",
    "The husband had\nsuffered from high blood pressure at one time but was in good condition by the taking of suitable\nmedicaments which kept him on an even keel.",
    "His wife was slightly deaf and had had a little minor heart\ntrouble nothing to be worried about.",
    "Of course it could be as does happen sometimes that one or other\nof them had fears for their health.",
    "There are a lot of people who are in good health but are quite\nconvinced they have cancer are quite sure that they wont live another year.",
    "Sometimes that leads to their\ntaking their own life.",
    "The Ravenscrofts didnt seem that kind of people.",
    "They seemed well balanced and\nplacid.",
    "So what did you really think said Poirot.",
    "The trouble is that I couldnt think.",
    "Looking back I say to myself it was suicide.",
    "It could only have been\nsuicide.",
    "For some reason or other they decided that life was unbearable to them.",
    "Not through financial\ntrouble not through health difficulties not because of unhappiness.",
    "And there you see I came to a full\nstop.",
    "It had all the marks of suicide.",
    "I cannot see any other thing that could have happened except\nsuicide.",
    "They went for a walk.",
    "On that walk they took a revolver with them.",
    "The revolver lay between the two\nbodies.",
    "There were blurred fingerprints of both of them.",
    "Both of them in fact had handled it but there\nwas nothing to show who had fired it last.",
    "One tends to think the husband perhaps shot his wife and then\nhimself.",
    "That is only because it seems more likely.",
    "Well why A great many years have passed.",
    "When something reminds me now and again something I\nread in the papers of bodies a husband and wifes bodies somewhere lying dead having taken their own\nlives apparently I think back and then I wonder again what happened in the Ravenscroft case.",
    "Twelve years ago or fourteen and I still remember the Ravenscroft case and wonderwell just the one\nword I think.",
    "Whywhywhy Did the husband really hate his wife and had hated her for a long time\nDid the wife really hate her husband and want to get rid of him Did they go on hating each other until\nthey could bear it no longer Garroway broke off another piece of bread and chewed at it.",
    "You got some idea.",
    "Monsieur Poirot Has somebody come to you and told you something that has\nawakened your interest particularly Do you know something that might explain the Why No.",
    "All the\nsame said Poirot you must have had a theory.",
    "Come now you had a theory Youre quite right of\ncourse.",
    "One does have theories.",
    "One expects them all or one of them at least to work out but they\ndont usually.",
    "I think that my theory was in the end that you couldnt look for the cause because one\ndidnt know enough.",
    "What did I know about them General Ravenscroft was close on sixty his wife was thirtyfive.",
    "All I\nknew of them strictly speaking was the last five or six years of their lives.",
    "The General had retired on a\npension.",
    "They had come back to England from abroad and all the evidence that came to me all the\nknowledge was of a brief period during which they had first a house at Bournemouth and then moved to\nwhere they lived in the home where the tragedy took place.",
    "They had lived there peacefully happily their\nchildren came home there for school holidays.",
    "It was a peaceful period I should say at the end of what\none presumed as a peaceful life.",
    "But then I thought but how much did I know of that peaceful life  I\n\n\fknew of their life after retirement in England of their family.",
    "There was no financial motive no motive of\nhatred no motive of sexual involvement of intrusive love affairs.",
    "No.",
    "But there was a period before that.",
    "What did I know about that What I knew was a life spent mostly\nabroad with occasional visits home a good record for the man pleasant remembrances of her from\nfriends of the wifes.",
    "There was no outstanding tragedy dispute nothing that one knew of.",
    "But then I\nmightnt have known.",
    "One doesnt know.",
    "There was a period of say twentythirty years years from\nchildhood to the time they married the time they lived abroad in India and other places.",
    "Perhaps the root\nof the tragedy was there.",
    "There is a proverb my grandmother used to repeat Old sins have long shadows.",
    "Was the cause of death\nsome long shadow a shadow from the past Thats not an easy thing to find out about.",
    "You find out\nabout a mans record what friends or acquaintances say but you dont know any inner details.",
    "Well I think little by little the theory grew up in my mind that that would have been the place to look if I\ncould have looked.",
    "Something that had happened then in another country perhaps.",
    "Something that had\nbeen thought to be forgotten to have passed out of existence but which still perhaps existed.",
    "A grudge from the past some happening that nobody knew about that had happened elsewhere not in\ntheir life in England but which may have been there.",
    "If one had known where to look for it.",
    "Not the\nsort of thing you mean said Poirot that anybody would remember.",
    "I mean remember nowadays.",
    "Something that no friends of theirs in England perhaps would have known about.",
    "Their friends in\nEngland seem to have been mostly made since retirement though I suppose old friends did come and\nvisit them or see them occasionally.",
    "But one doesnt hear about things that happened in the past.",
    "People\nforget.",
    "Yes said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "People forget.",
    "Theyre not like elephants said Superintendent\nGarroway giving a faint smile.",
    "Elephants they always say remember everything.",
    "It is odd that you\nshould say that said Poirot.",
    "That I should say about long sins Not so much that.",
    "It was your mention of elephants that interested\nme.",
    "Superintendent Garroway looked at Poirot with some surprise.",
    "He seemed to be waiting for more.",
    "Spence also cast a quick glance at his old friend.",
    "Something that happened in India perhaps he suggested.",
    "I mean\u2014well thats where elephants come from isnt it Or from Africa.",
    "Anyway whos been talking to\nyou about elephants he added.",

    "I dont\nthink it likely that shed have gone out for a walk carrying a revolver.",
    "No.",
    "No it wouldnt have been so\neasy would it But there was nothing apparently in the evidence to show that there was any\nunhappiness or that thered been any quarrel between them or that there was any reason why they should\ncommit suicide.",

    "No no said\nMrs. Oliver.",

    "He was quite healthy.",
    "I mean he had\u2014I think he had had\na\u2014what do they call those things\u2014coronary is that what I mean It sounds like a crown doesnt it but\nits really a heart attack isnt it Hed had that but hed recovered from it and she was well she was\nvery nervy.",
    "She was neurotic always.",
    "Yes I seem to remember that said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Of course I\ndidnt know them well but\u2014 she asked suddenly\u2014 was she wearing a wig Oh.",
    "Well you know I\ncant really remember that.",
    "She always wore her wig.",
    "One of them I mean.",
    "I just wondered said Mrs.\nOliver.",

    "What do you really think Julia Well as I said dear one wonders you know.",
    "There were things said\nbut then there always are.",
    "About him or her Well they said that there was a young woman you\nknow.",
    "Yes I think she did some secretarial work for him.",
    "He was writing his memoirs of his career in IndiaI\nbelieve commissioned by a publisher at thatand she used to take dictation from him.",
    "But some people\nsaidwell you know what they do say sometimes that perhaps he had gotertied up with this girl in\nsome way.",
    "She wasnt very young.",
    "She was over thirty and not very goodlooking and I dont thinkthere were no scandals about her or anything but still one doesnt know.",
    "People thought he might have\nshot his wife because he wanted towell he might have wanted to marry her yes.",
    "But I dont really think\npeople said that sort of thing and I never believed it.",
    "What did you think Well of course I wondered\na little about her.",
    "You mean that a man was mentioned I believe there was something out in Malaya.",
    "Some kind of story I heard about her.",
    "That she got embroiled with some young man much younger than\nherself.",
    "And her husband hadnt liked it much and it had caused a bit of scandal.",
    "I forget where.",
    "But\nanyway that was a long time ago and I dont think anything ever came of it.",
    "You dont think there was\n\n\fany talk nearer home No special relationship with anyone in the neighborhood There wasnt any\nevidence of quarrels between them or anything of that kind No I dont think so.",
    "Of course I read\neverything about it at the time.",
    "One did discuss it of course because one couldnt help feeling there might\nbe some\u2014well some really very tragic love story connected with it.",
    "But there wasnt you think They\nhad children didnt they There was my goddaughter of course.",
    "Oh yes and there was a son.",
    "I think\nhe was quite young At school somewhere.",
    "The girl was only twelve no\u2014older than that.",
    "She was with a\nfamily in Switzerland.",
    "There was no\u2014no mental trouble I suppose in the family Oh you mean the\nboy\u2014yes might be of course.",
    "You do hear very strange things.",
    "There was that boy who shot his\nfather\u2014that was somewhere near Newcastle I think.",
    "Some years before that.",
    "You know.",
    "Hed been\nvery depressed and at first I think they said he tried to hang himself when he was at the university and\nthen he came and shot his father.",
    "But nobody quite knew why.",
    "Anyway there wasnt anything of that sort\nwith the Ravenscrofts.",
    "No I dont think so in fact Im pretty sure of it.",
    "I cant help thinking in some\nways\u2014 Yes Julia I cant help thinking that there might have been a man you know.",
    "You mean that\nshe\u2014 Yes well\u2014well one thinks it rather likely you know.",
    "The wigs for one thing.",
    "I dont quite\nsee how the wigs come into it.",
    "Well wanting to improve her appearance.",
    "She was thirtyfive I think.",
    "More.",
    "More.",
    "Thirtysix I think.",
    "And well I know she showed me the wigs one day and one or two of\nthem really made her look quite attractive.",
    "And she used a good deal of makeup.",
    "And that had all\nstarted just after they had come to live there I think.",
    "She was rather a goodlooking woman.",
    "You\nmean she might have met someone\u2014some man Well thats what Ive always thought said Mrs.\nCarstairs.",
    "You see if a mans getting off with a girl people notice it usually because men arent so good at hiding\ntheir tracks.",
    "But a woman it might bewell I mean like someone shed met and nobody knew much\nabout it.",
    "Oh do you really think so Julia No I dont really think so said Julia because I mean\npeople always do know dont they I mean you know servants know or gardeners or bus drivers.",
    "Or\nsomebody in the neighborhood.",
    "And they know.",
    "And they talk.",
    "But still there could have been\nsomething like that and either he found out about it... You mean it was a crime of jealousy I think so\nyes.",
    "So you think its more likely that he shot her then himself than that she shot him and then herself.",
    "Well I should think so because I think if she were trying to get rid of himwell I dont think theyd\nhave gone for a walk together and shed have to have taken the revolver with her in a handbag and it\nwould have been rather a bigger handbag if so.",
    "One has to think of the practical side of things.",
    "I know\nsaid Mrs. Oliver.",
    "One does.",
    "Its very interesting.",
    "It must be interesting to you dear because you write\nthese crime stories.",
    "So I expect really you would have better ideas.",
    "Youd know more whats likely to\nhappen.",
    "I dont know whats likely to happen said Mrs. Oliver because you see in all the crimes\nthat I write Ive invented the crimes.",
    "I mean what I want to happen happens in my stories.",
    "Its not\nsomething that actually has happened or that could happen.",
    "So Im really the worst person to talk about\nit.",
    "Im interested to know what you think because you know people very well Julia and you knew them\nwell.",
    "And I think she might have said something to you one dayor he might.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes now wait a\nminute when you say that that seems to bring something back to me.",
    "Mrs. Carstays leaned back in her\nchair shook her head doubtfully half closed her eyes and went into a kind of coma.",
    "Mrs. Oliver remained silent with a look on her face which women are apt to wear when they are waiting\nfor the first signs of a kettle coming to the boil.",
    "She did say something once I remember and I wonder what she meant by it said Mrs. Carstairs.",
    "Something about starting a new lifein connection I think with St. Teresa.",
    "St.\nTeresa of Avila.",
    "Mrs. Oliver looked slightly startled.",
    "But how did St. Teresa of Avila come into it Well I dont know really.",
    "I think she must have been\nreading a Life of her.",
    "Anyway she said that it was wonderful how women get a sort of second wind.",
    "Thats not quite the term she used but something like that.",
    "You know when they are forty or fifty or that\nsort of age and they suddenly want to begin a new life.",
    "Teresa of Avila did.",
    "She hadnt done anything\nspecial up till then except being a nun then she went out and reformed all the convents didnt she and\nflung her weight about and became a great saint.",
    "Yes but that doesnt seem quite the same thing.",
    "No\nit doesnt said Mrs. Carstairs.",
    "But women do talk in a very silly way you know when they are\nreferring to love affairs when they get on in life.",
    "About how its never too late.",
    "CHAPTER VII Back To The Nursery\nMrs. Oliver looked rather doubtfully at the three steps and the front door of a small rather\ndilapidatedlooking cottage in the side street.",
    "Below the windows some bulbs were growing mainly\ntulips.",
    "Mrs. Oliver paused opened the little address book in her hand verified that she was in the place she\nthought she was and rapped gently with the knocker after having tried to press a bellpush of possible\nelectrical significance but which did not seem to yield any satisfactory bell ringing inside or anything of\nthat kind.",
    "Presently not getting any response she knocked again.",
    "This time there were sounds from\ninside.",
    "A shuffling sound of feet some asthmatic breathing and hands apparently trying to manage the opening of\nthe door.",
    "With this noise there came a few vague echoes in the letter box.",
    "Oh drat it.",
    "Drat it.",
    "Stuck again you brute you.",
    "Finally success met these inward industries and the\ndoor making a creaky and rather doubtful noise was slowly pulled open.",
    "A very old woman with a\nwrinkled face humped shoulders and a general arthritic appearance looked at her.",
    "Visitor.",
    "Her face was unwelcoming.",
    "It held no sign of fear merely of distaste for those who came and knocked at\nthe home of an Englishwomans castle.",
    "She might have been seventy or eighty but she was still a valiant\ndefender of her home.",
    "I dunno what youve come about and I\u2014 she stopped.",
    "Why she said its Miss Ariadne.",
    "Well I never now Its Miss Ariadne.",
    "I think youre wonderful to\nknow me said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "How are you Mrs. Matcham Miss Ariadne Just think of that now.",
    "It was Mrs. Ariadne Oliver\nthought a long time ago since she had been addressed as Miss Ariadne but the intonation of the voice\ncracked with age though it was rang a familiar note.",

    "Youre lookin well you are.",
    "I dunno how many years it is since Ive seen you.",
    "Fifteen at least.",

    "She came in.",
    "Mrs. Matcham was\nshaking hands her hands were rather unwilling to obey their owners orders.",
    "She managed to shut the door and shuffling her feet and limping entered a small room which was\nobviously one that was kept for the reception of any likely or unlikely visitors whom Mrs. Matcham was\nprepared to admit to her home.",
    "There were large numbers of photographs\u2014some of babies some of adults.",
    "Some in nice leather frames\nwhich were slowly drooping but had not quite fallen to pieces yet.",
    "One in a silver frame by now rather\ntarnished representing a young woman in presentation court dress with feathers rising up on her head.",

    "Well my dear fancy seeing you.",
    "And youre still writing your pretty stories are you Yes said Mrs.\nOliver assenting to this though with a slight doubt as to how far detective stories and stories of crime and\ngeneral criminal behavior could be called pretty stories.",
    "But that she thought was very much a habit of\nMrs.\nMatchams.",
    "Im all alone now said Mrs. Matcham.",
    "You remember Gracie my sister She died last autumn she\ndid.",

    "Ah And talk about old times perhaps.",
    "Always nice\nwhen  you can do that isnt it Yes indeed said Mrs. Oliver feeling some relief that this particular\nline had been indicated to her since it was more or less what she had come for.",
    "What a lot of\nphotographs youve got she said.",
    "Ah I have an that.",
    "Dyou know when I was in that homesilly name it had Sunset House of\nHappiness for the Aged something like that it was called a year and a quarter I lived there till I couldnt\nstand it no more a nasty lot they were saying you couldnt have any of your own things with you.",

    "People called Ravenscroft.",
    "Oh I\nremember that well.",
    "You worked for them didnt you at one time Mrs. Buckle Yes.",

    "Yes it was indeed.",
    "Were you\nstill working for them at that time No.",
    "As a matter of fact Id given up going there.",
    "I had my old Aunt\nEmma come to live with me and she was rather blind and not very well and I couldnt really spare the\ntime any more to go out doing things for people.",
    "But Id been with them up to about a month or two\nbefore that.",
    "It seemed such a terrible thing to happen said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "I understand that they thought it was a suicide pact.",
    "I dont believe that said Mrs. Buckle Im\nsure theyd never have committed suicide together.",
    "Not people that age.",
    "And living so pleasantly together as they did.",
    "Of course they hadnt lived there very long.",
    "No I\nsuppose they hadnt said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "They lived somewhere near Bournemouth didnt they when\nthey first came to England Yes but they found it was a bit too far for getting to London from there\nand so thats why they came to Chipping Bartram.",
    "Very nice house it was and a nice garden.",
    "Were\nthey both in good health when you were working for them last Well they felt their age a bit as most\npeople do.",
    "The General hed had some kind of heart trouble or a slight stroke.",

    "And Mrs Ravenscroft\nWell I think she missed the life shed had abroad you know.",
    "They didnt know so very many people\nthere although they got to know a good many families of course being the sort of class they were.",
    "But I\nsuppose it wasnt like India or those places.",
    "You know where you have a lot of servants.",
    "I suppose gay\nparties and that sort of thing.",
    "You think she missed her gay parties Well I dont know that exactly.",
    "Somebody told me shed taken to wearing a wig.",
    "Oh shed got several wigs said Mrs. Buckle\nsmiling slightly.",
    "Very smart ones and very expensive.",
    "You know from time to time shed send one back\nto the place shed got it from in London and theyd redress it for her again and send it.",
    "There were all\nkinds.",
    "You know there was one with auburn hair and one with little gray curls all over her head Really\nshe looked very nice in that one.",
    "And two\u2014well not so attractive really but useful for\u2014you\nknow\u2014windy days when you wanted something to put on when it might be raining.",
    "Thought a lot about\nher appearance you know and spent a lot of her money on clothes.",
    "What do you think was the cause\nof the tragedy said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You see not being anywhere near here and not seeing any of my\nfriends at that time because I was in America I missed hearing anything about it and well one doesnt\nlike to ask questions or write letters about things of that kind.",
    "I suppose there must have been some\ncause.",
    "I mean it was General Ravenscrofts own revolver that was used I understand.",
    "Oh yes he had two of those in the house because he said that no house was safe without.",
    "Perhaps he\nwas right there you know.",
    "Not that theyd had any trouble beforehand as far as I know.",
    "One afternoon a\nrather nasty sort of fellow came along to the door.",
    "Didnt like the look of him I didnt.",
    "Wanted to see the\nGeneral.",
    "Said hed been in the Generals regiment when he was a young fellow.",
    "The General asked him a\nfew questions and I think thought as how he didntwell thought he wasnt very reliable.",
    "So he sent him\noff.",
    "You think then that it was someone outside that did it Well I think it must have been because I\ncant see any other thing.",
    "Mind you I didnt like the man who came and did the gardening for them very\nmuch.",
    "He hadnt got a very good reputation and I gather hed had a few jail sentences earlier in his life.",
    "But of course the General took up his references and he wanted to give him a chance.",
    "So you think the\ngardener might have killed them Well II always thought that.",
    "But then Im probably wrong.",
    "But it\ndoesnt seem to me I mean the people who said there was some scandalous story or something about\n\n\feither her or him and that either hed shot her or shed shot him thats all nonsense Id say.",
    "No it was\nsome outsider.",
    "One of these people thatwell its not as bad as it is nowadays because that you must remember was\nbefore people began getting all this violence idea.",
    "But look at what you read in the papers every day\nnow.",
    "Young men practically only boys still taking a lot of drugs and going wild and rushing about\nshooting a lot of people for nothing at all asking a girl in a pub to have a drink with them and then they\nsee her home and next day her bodys found in a ditch.",
    "Stealing children out of prams from their mothers\ntaking a girl to a dance and murdering her or strangling her on the way back.",
    "If anything you feel as anyone can do anything.",
    "And anyway theres that nice couple the General and his\nwife out for a nice walk in the evening and there they were both shot through the head.",
    "Was it through\nthe head Well I dont remember exactly now and of course I never saw anything myself.",
    "But anyway\njust went for a walk as they often did.",
    "And theyd not been on bad terms with each other Well they\nhad words now and again but who doesnt No boy friend or girl friend Well if you can use that\nterm of people of that age oh I mean there was a bit of talk here and there but it was all nonsense.",
    "Nothing to it at all.",
    "People always want to say something of that kind.",
    "Perhaps one of them was\u2014ill.",
    "Well Lady Ravenscroft had been up to London once or twice consulting a doctor about something and\nI rather think she was going into hospital or planning to go into hospital for an operation of some kind\nthough she never told me exactly what it was.",
    "But I think they managed to put her right\u2014she was in this\nhospital for a short time.",
    "No operation I think.",
    "And when she came back she looked very much younger.",
    "Altogether shed had a lot of face treatment and you know she looked so pretty in these wigs with curls\non them.",
    "Rather as though shed got a new lease of life.",
    "And General Ravenscroft He was a very\nnice gentleman and I never heard or knew of any scandal about him and I dont think there was any.",
    "People say things but then they want to say something when theres been a tragedy of any kind.",
    "It seems\nto me perhaps as he might have had a blow on the head in India or something like that I had an uncle or\na greatuncle you know who fell off his horse there once.",
    "Hit it on a cannon or something and he was\nvery queer afterwards.",
    "All right for about six months and then they had to put him into an asylum because\nhe wanted to take his wifes life the whole time.",
    "He said she was persecuting him and following him and\nthat she was a spy for another nation.",
    "Ah theres no saying what things happen or can happen in\nfamilies.",
    "Anyway you dont think there was any truth in some of the stories about them that I have\nhappened to hear of bad feeling between them so that one of them shot the other and then shot himself\nor herself Oh no I dont.",
    "Were her children at home at the time No.",
    "Misseroh what was her\nname now Rosie No.",
    "Penelope Celia said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Shes my goddaughter.",
    "Oh of course she is.",
    "Yes I know that\nnow.",
    "I remember you coming and taking her out once.",
    "She was a highspirited girl rather badtempered\nin some ways but she was very fond of her father and mother I think.",
    "No she was away at a school in\nSwitzerland when it happened.",
    "Im glad to say because it would have been a terrible shock to her if\nshed been at home and the one who saw them.",
    "And there was a boy too wasnt there Oh yes.",
    "Master Edward.",
    "His father was a bit worried about him I think.",
    "He looked as though he disliked his\nfather.",
    "Oh theres nothing in that.",
    "Boys go through that stage I think.",
    "Was he very devoted to his\nmother Well she fussed over him a bit too much I think which he found tiresome.",
    "You know they\ndont like a mother fussing over them telling them to wear thicker vests or put an extra pullover on.",
    "His\nfather he didnt like the way he wore his hair.",
    "It waswell they werent wearing hair like the way they\nare nowadays but they were beginning to if you know what I mean.",
    "But the boy wasnt at home at the\ntime of the tragedy No.",
    "I suppose it was a shock to him Well it must have been.",
    "Of course I\n\n\fwasnt going to the house any more at that time so I didnt hear so much.",
    "If you ask me I didnt like that\ngardener.",
    "What was his name now Fred I think.",
    "Fred Wizell.",
    "Some name like that.",
    "Seems to me if\nhed done a bit ofwell a bit of cheating or something like that and the General had found him out and\nwas going to sack him I wouldnt put it past him.",
    "To shoot the husband and wife Well Id have\nthought it more likely hed just have shot the General.",
    "If he shot the General and the wife came along\nthen hed have had to shoot her too.",
    "You read things like that in books.",
    "Yes said Mrs. Oliver\nthoughtfully one does read all sorts of things in books.",
    "There was the tutor.",
    "I didnt like him much.",
    "What tutor Well there was a tutor for the boy earlier.",
    "You know he couldnt pass an exam and\nthings at the earlier school he was atprep school or something.",
    "So they had a tutor for him.",
    "He was\nthere for about a year I think.",
    "Lady Ravenscroft liked him very much.",
    "She was musical you know and\nso was this tutor.",
    "Mr. Edmunds I think his name was.",
    "Rather a nambypamby sort of young man I\nthought myself and its my opinion that General Ravenscroft didnt care for him much.",
    "But Mrs.\nRavenscroft did.",
    "Oh they had a lot in common I think.",
    "And I think she was the one really that chose\nhim rather more than the General Mind you he had very nice manners and spoke to everyone nicely and\nall that And didwhatshisname Edward Oh yes he liked him all right I think.",
    "In fact he was\nquite a bit soft on him I think.",
    "Almost a bit of hero worship.",
    "Anyway dont you believe any stories you\nhear about scandals in the family or her having an affair with anyone or General Ravenscroft with that\nrather piefaced girl who did filing work for him and all that sort of thing.",
    "No.",
    "Whoever that wicked murderer was its one who came from outside.",
    "The police never got on to anyone\nno car was seen near there and there was nothing to it and they never got any further.",
    "But all the same I\nthink one ought to look about for somebody perhaps whod known them in Malaya or abroad or\nsomewhere else or even when they were first living at Bournemouth.",
    "One never knows.",
    "What did your\nhusband think about it said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "He wouldnt have known as much about them as you would of course but still he might have heard a\nlot.",
    "Oh he heard a lot of talk of course.",
    "In the George and Flag of an evening you know.",
    "People\nsaying all sorts of things.",
    "Said as she drank and that cases of empty bottles had been taken out of the\nhouse.",
    "Absolutely untrue that was I know for a fact.",
    "And there was a nephew as used to come and see\nthem sometimes.",
    "Got into trouble with the police in some way he did but I dont think there was\nanything in that.",
    "The police didnt either.",
    "Anyway it wasnt at that time.",
    "There was no one else really\nliving in the house was there except the General and Lady Ravenscroft Well she had a sister as used\nto come sometimes Lady Ravenscroft did.",
    "She was a halfsister I think.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Looked\nrather like Lady Ravenscroft but not very goodlooking and a year or two older I should say.",
    "She made a\nbit of trouble between them I always used to think when she came for a visit.",
    "She was one of those who\nlikes stirring things up if you know what I mean.",
    "just said things to annoy people.",
    "\u2022\u00a7r Was Lady\nRavenscroft fond of her Well if you ask me I dont think she was really.",
    "I think the sister more or less\nwished herself on to them sometimes and she didnt like not to have her but I think she found it pretty\ntrying to have her there.",
    "The General quite liked her because she played cards well.",
    "Played chess and\nthings with him and he enjoyed that.",
    "And she was an amusing woman in a way.",
    "Mrs. Jerryboy or\nsomething like that her name was.",
    "She was a widow I think.",

    "Did you like her Well if\nyou dont mind my saying so maam no I didnt like her.",
    "I disliked her very much.",
    "I thought she was one\nof those troublemakers you know.",
    "But she hadnt been down for some time before the tragedy\nhappened.",
    "I dont really remember very much what she was like.",
    "She had a son as came with her once or\ntwice.",
    "Didnt like him very much.",
    "Shifty I thought.",
    "Well said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I suppose nobody will\nreally ever know the truth.",
    "Not now.",
    "Not after all this time.",
    "I saw my goddaughter the other day.",
    "Did\nyou now maam.",
    "Id be interested to hear about Miss Celia.",
    "How is she All right Yes.",
    "She seems\nquite all right.",
    "I think shes thinking perhaps of getting married.",
    "At any rate shes got a Got a steady\nboy friend has she said Mrs. Buckle.",
    "Ah well weve all got that.",
    "Not that we all marry the first one\n\n\fwe settle on.",
    "Just as well if you dont nine times out of ten.",
    "You dont know a Mrs. BurtonCox do\nyou asked Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "BurtonCox I seem to know that name.",
    "No I dont think so.",
    "Wasnt living down here or come to stay\nwith them or anything No not that I remember.",
    "Yet I did hear something.",
    "Some old friend of General Ravenscroft I think which hed known in India.",
    "But I dont know.",
    "She\nshook her head.",
    "Well said Mrs. Oliver I mustnt stay gossiping with you any longer.",
    "Its been so nice to see you and\nMarlene.",
    "CHAPTER IX Results Of Elephantine Research\nA telephone call for you said Hercule Poirots manservant George.",
    "From Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Ah yes\nGeorge.",
    "And what had she to say She wondered if she could come and see you this evening sir after\ndinner That would be admirable said Poirot.",
    "Admirable.",
    "I have had a tiring day.",
    "It will be a\nstimulating experience to see Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She is always entertaining as well as being highly unexpected in\nthe things she says.",
    "Did she mention elephants by the way Elephants sir No I do not think so.",
    "Ah.",
    "Then it would seem perhaps that the elephants have been disappointing.",
    "George looked at his master\nrather doubtfully.",
    "There were times when he did not quite understand the relevance of Poirots remarks.",
    "Ring her back said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Tell her I shall be delighted to receive her.",
    "George went away to\ncarry out this order and returned to say that Mrs. Oliver would be there about quarter to nine.",
    "Coffee said Poirot.",
    "Let coffee be prepared and some petits fours.",
    "I rather think I ordered some in\nlately from Fortnum and Mason.",
    "A liqueur of any kind sir No I think not.",
    "I myself will have some\nSirop de Cassis.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Mrs. Oliver arrived exactly on time.",
    "Poirot greeted her with every sign of\npleasure.",
    "And how are you chere madame Exhausted said Mrs. Oliver She sank down into the armchair that\nPoirot indicated.",
    "Completely exhausted.",
    "Ah.",
    "Qui va a la chasseoh I cannot remember the saying.",
    "I remember it\nsaid Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I learned it as a child.",
    "Qui va a la chasse perd sa place.",
    "That I am sure is not\napplicable to the chase you have been conducting.",
    "I am referring to the pursuit of elephants unless that\nwas merely a figure of speech.",
    "Not at all said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I have been pursuing elephants madly.",
    "Here there and everywhere.",
    "The amount of petrol I have used the amount of trains I have taken the\namount of letters Ive written the amount of telegrams Ive sentyou wouldnt believe how exhausting it\nall is.",
    "Then repose yourself.",
    "Have some coffee.",
    "Nice strong black coffeeyes I will.",
    "Just what I\nwant.",
    "Did you may I ask get any results Plenty of results said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "The trouble is I dont\nknow whether any of them are any use.",
    "You learned facts however No.",
    "Not really.",
    "I learned things\nthat people told me were facts but I strongly doubt myself whether any of them were facts.",
    "They were\nheresay No.",
    "They were what I said they would be.",
    "They were memories.",
    "Lots of people who had\nmemories.",
    "The trouble is when you remember things you dont always remember them right do you\nNo.",
    "But they are still what you might describe perhaps as results.",
    "Is not that so And what have you\ndone said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You are always so stern madame said Poirot.",
    "You demand that I run about that I also do things.",
    "Well have you run about I have not run about but I have had a few consultations with others of my\nown profession.",
    "It sounds far more peaceful than what I have been doing said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Oh this\ncoffee is nice.",
    "Its really strong.",
    "You wouldnt believe how tired I am.",
    "And how muddled.",
    "Come come.",
    "Let us have good expectancy.",
    "You have got things.",
    "You have got something I think.",
    "Ive got a lot of different suggestions and stories.",
    "I dont know whether any of them are true.",
    "They could be not true but still be of use said Poirot.",
    "Well I know what you mean said Mrs. Oliver and thats what I think too.",
    "I mean thats what I\nthought when I went about it.",
    "When people remember something and tell you about itI mean its often\nnot quite actually what occurred but its what they themselves thought occurred.",
    "But they must have\nhad something on which to base it said Poirot.",
    "Ive brought you a list of a kind said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I dont need to go into details of where I went or\nwhat I said or why I went out deliberately forwell information one couldnt perhaps get from anybody\nin this country now.",
    "But its all from people who knew something about the Ravenscrofts even if they\nhadnt known them very well.",
    "News from foreign places do you mean Quite a lot of them were from\nforeign places.",
    "Other people who knew them here rather slightly or from people whose aunts or cousins\nor friends knew them long ago.",
    "And each one that youve noted down had some story to tell\u2014some\nreference to the tragedy or to people involved Thats the idea said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Ill tell you roughly\nshall I Yes.",
    "Have a petit four.",
    "Thank you said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She took a particularly sweet and rather biliouslooking one and champed it with energy.",
    "Sweet things she said really give you a lot of vitality I always think.",
    "Well now Ive got the following\nsuggestions.",
    "These things have usually been said to me starting by Oh yes of course How sad it was that whole\nstory Of course I think everyone knows really what happened.",
    "Thats the sort of thing.",
    "Yes.",
    "These\npeople thought they knew what happened.",
    "But there werent really any very good reasons.",
    "It was just\nsomething someone had told them or theyd heard either from friends or servants or relations or things\nlike that.",
    "The suggestions of course are all the kind that you might think they were.",
    "A.",
    "That General Ravenscroft was writing his memoirs of his Indian days and that he had a young woman\nwho acted as his secretary and took dictation and typed things for him and was helping him that she was\na nicelooking girl and no doubt there was something there.",
    "The result being\u2014well there seemed to be\ntwo schools of thought.",
    "One school of thought was that he shot his wife because he hoped to marry the\ngirl and then when he had shot her immediately was horrorstricken at what hed done and shot\nhimself...",
    "Exactly said Poirot.",
    "A romantic explanation.",
    "The other idea was that there had been a\ntutor who came to give lessons to the son who had been ill and away from his prep school for six months\nor so\u2014a goodlooking young man.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "And the wife had fallen in love with the young man.",
    "Perhaps had an affair with him That was the idea said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "No kind of evidence.",
    "Just romantic suggestion again.",
    "And therefore Therefore I think the idea was that the General\nprobably shot his wife and then in a fit of remorse shot himself.",
    "There was another story that the General\nhad had an affair and his wife found out about it that she shot him and then herself.",
    "Its always been slightly different every time.",
    "But nobody really knew anything.",
    "I mean its always just a\nlikely story every time.",
    "I mean the General may have had an affair with a girl or lots of girls or just\nanother married woman or it might have been the wife who had an affair with someone.",
    "Its been a different someone in each story Ive been told.",
    "There was nothing definite about it or any evidence for it.",
    "Its just the gossip that went around about\ntwelve or thirteen years ago which people have rather forgotten about now.",
    "But they remember enough\nabout it to tell one a few names and get things only moderately wrong about what happened.",
    "There was\nan angry gardener who happened to live on the place there was a nice elderly cookhousekeeper who\nwas rather blind and rather deaf but nobody seems to suspect that she had anything to do with it.",
    "And so\non.",
    "Ive got all the names and possibilities written down.",
    "The names of some of them wrong and some of\nthem right.",
    "Its all very difficult.",
    "His wife had been ill I gather for some short time.",
    "I think it was some\nkind of fever that she had.",
    "A lot of her hair must have fallen out because she bought four wigs.",
    "There\nwere at least four new wigs found among her things.",
    "Yes.",
    "I too heard that said Poirot.",
    "Who did you hear it from A friend of mine in the police.",
    "He went back over the accounts of the\ninquest and the various things in the house.",
    "Four wigs I would like to have your opinion on that madame.",
    "Do you think that four wigs seems somewhat excessive Well I do really said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I had an\naunt who had a wig and she had an extra wig but she sent one back to be redressed and wore the\nsecond one.",
    "I never heard of anyone who had four wigs.",
    "Mrs. Oliver extracted a small notebook from\nher bag ruffled the pages of it searching for extracts.",
    "Mrs. Carstairs shes seventyseven and rather gaga.",
    "Quote from her I do remember the Ravenscrofts\nquite well.",
    "Yes yes a very nice couple.",
    "Its very sad I think.",
    "Yes.",
    "Cancer it was I asked then which of\nthem had cancer said Mrs.\nOliver but Mrs. Carstairs had rather forgotten about that.",
    "She said she thought the wife came to London and consulted a doctor and had an operation and then\ncame home and was very miserable and her husband was very upset about her.",
    "So of course he shot her\nand himself.",
    "Was that her theory or did she have any exact knowledge I think it was entirely theory.",
    "As far as I can see and hear in the course of my investigations said Mrs. Oliver making rather a point of\nthis last word when anybody has heard that any of their friends whom they dont happen to know very\nwell have sudden illnesses or consult doctors they always think its cancer.",
    "And so do the people\nthemselves I think.",
    "Somebody elseI cant read her name here Ive forgotten I think it began with\nTshe said that it was the husband who had cancer.",
    "He was very unhappy and so was his wife.",
    "And\nthey talked it over together and they couldnt bear the thought of it all so they decided to commit\nsuicide.",
    "Sad and romantic said Poirot.",
    "Yes and I dont think really true said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "It is worrying isnt it I mean the people\nremembering so much and that they really mostly seem to have made it up themselves.",
    "They have made\nup the solution of something they knew about said Poirot.",
    "That is to say they know that somebody\ncomes to London say to consult a doctoror that somebody has been in hospital for two or three\nmonths.",
    "That is a fact that they know.",
    "Yes said Mrs. Oliver and then when they come to talk about it\na long time afterwards theyve got the solution for it which theyve made up themselves.",
    "That isnt awfully\nhelpful is it It is helpful said Poirot.",
    "You are quite right you know in what you said to me.",
    "About\nelephants said Mrs. Oliver rather doubtfully.",
    "About elephants said Poirot.",
    "It is important to know certain facts which have lingered in peoples\nmemories although they may not know exactly what the fact was why it happened or what led to it.",
    "But\nthey might easily know something that we do not know and that we have no means of learning.",
    "So there\n\n\fhave been memories leading to theories theories of infidelity of illness of suicide pacts of jealousy.",
    "All these things have been suggested to you.",
    "Further search could be made as to points if they seem in\nany way probable.",
    "People like talking about the past said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "They like talking about the\npast really much more than they like talking about whats happening now or what happened last year.",
    "It\nbrings things back to them.",
    "They tell you of course first about a lot of other people that you dont want\nto hear about and then you hear what the other people that theyve remembered knew about somebody\nelse that they didnt know but they heard about.",
    "You know so that the General and Lady Ravenscroft\nyou hear about is at once removed as it were.",
    "Its like family relationships she said.",
    "You know first cousin once removed second cousin twice\nremoved all the rest of it.",
    "I dont think Ive been really very helpful though.",
    "You must not think that\nsaid Poirot.",
    "I am pretty sure that you will find that some of these things in your agreeable little\npurplecolored notebook will have something to do with the past tragedy.",
    "I can tell you from my own\ninquiries into the official accounts of these two deaths that they have remained a mystery.",
    "That is from\nthe police point of view.",
    "They were an affectionate couple there was no gossip or hearsay much about them of any sex trouble\nthere was no illness discovered such as would have caused anyone to take their own lives.",
    "I talk now\nonly of the time you understand immediately preceding the tragedy.",
    "But there was a time before that\nfurther back.",
    "I know what you mean said Mrs. Oliver and Ive got something about that from an old\nNanny.",
    "An old Nanny who is nowI dont know she might be a hundred but I think shes only about\neighty.",
    "I remember her from my childhood days.",
    "She wasnt very young then.",
    "She used to tell me stories\nabout people in the Services abroadIndia Egypt Siam and Hong Kong and the rest.",
    "Anything that\ninterested you Yes said Mrs. Oliver there was some tragedy that she talked about.",
    "She seemed a\nbit uncertain about what it was.",
    "Im not sure that it had anything to do with the Ravenscrofts it might have been to do with some other\npeople out there because she doesnt remember surnames and things very well.",
    "It was a mental case in one family.",
    "Someones sisterinlaw.",
    "Either General Whoeveritwass sister or Mrs. Whoeveritwass sister.",
    "Somebody whod been in a\nmental home for years.",
    "I gathered shed killed her own children or tried to kill her own children long ago\nand then shed been supposed to be cured or paroled or something and came out to Egypt or India or\nwherever it was.",
    "She came out to stay with the people.",
    "And then it seems there was some other tragedy\nconnected again I think with children or something of that kind.",
    "Anyway it was something that was\nhushed up.",
    "But I wondered.",
    "I mean if there was something mental in the family either Lady\nRavenscrofts family or General Ravenscrofts family.",
    "I dont think it need have been as near as a sister.",
    "It\ncould have been a cousin or something like that.",
    "Butwell it seemed to me a possible line of inquiry.",
    "Yes said Poirot theres always possibility and\nsomething that waits for many years and then comes home to roost from somewhere in the past.",
    "That is\nwhat someone said to me.",
    "Old sins have long shadows.",
    "It seemed to me said Mrs. Oliver not that it\nwas likely or even that old Nanny Matcham remembered it right or even really about it being the people\nshe thought it was.",
    "But it might have fitted in with what that awful woman at the literary luncheon said to\nme.",
    "You mean when she wanted to know...",
    "Yes.",
    "When she wanted me to find out from the daughter\nmy godchild whether her mother had killed her father or whether her father had killed her mother.",
    "And\nshe thought the girl might know Well its likely enough that the girl would know.",
    "I mean not at the\ntime\u2014it might have been shielded from her\u2014but she might know things about it which would make her\nbe aware what the circumstances were in their lives and who was likely to have killed whom though she\n\n\fwould probably never mention it or say anything about it or talk to anyone about it.",
    "And you say that\nwoman\u2014this Mrs.\u2014 Yes.",
    "Ive forgotten her name now.",
    "Mrs. Burton something.",
    "A name like that.",
    "She said something about her son had this girl friend and that they were thinking of\ngetting married.",
    "And I can quite see you might want to know if so whether her mother or her father had criminal\nrelations in their family\u2014or a loony strain.",
    "She probably thought that if it was the mother who killed the\nfather it would be very unwise for the boy to marry her whereas if the father had killed the mother she\nprobably wouldnt mind as much said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "You mean that she would think that the inheritance would go in the female line Well she wasnt a very\nclever type of woman.",
    "Bossy said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Thinks she knows a lot but no.",
    "I think you might think\nthat way if you were a woman.",
    "An interesting point of view but possible said Poirot.",
    "Yes I realize that.",
    "He sighed.",
    "We have a lot to do still.",
    "Ive got another sidelight on things too.",
    "Same\nthing but second hand if you know what I mean.",
    "You know.",
    "Someone says The Ravenscrofts\nWerent they that couple who adopted a child Then it seems after it was all arranged and they were\nabsolutely stuck on itvery very keen on it one of their children had died in India I thinkbut at any\nrate they had adopted this child and then its own mother wanted it back and they had a court case or\nsomething.",
    "But the court gave them the custody of the child and the mother came and tried to kidnap it\nback.",
    "There are simpler points said Poirot arising out of your report points that I prefer.",
    "Such\nas Wigs.",
    "Four wigs.",
    "Well said Mrs. Oliver I thought that was interesting you but I dont know\nwhy.",
    "It doesnt seem to mean anything.",
    "The Indian story was just somebody mental.",
    "There are mental people who are in homes or loonybins\nbecause they have killed their children or some other child for some absolutely batty reason no sense to\nit at all.",
    "I dont see why that would make General and Lady Ravenscroft want to kill themselves.",
    "Unless\none of them was implicated said Poirot.",
    "You mean that General Ravenscroft may have killed someone a boyan illegitimate child perhaps of\nhis wifes or of his own No I think were getting a bit too melodramatic there.",
    "Or she might have killed\nher husbands child or her own.",
    "And yet said Poirot what people seem to be they usually are.",
    "You\nmean They seemed an affectionate couplea couple who lived together happily without disputes.",
    "They seem to have had no case history of illness beyond a suggestion of an operation of someone\ncoming to London to consult some medical authority a possibility of cancer of leukemia something of\nthat kind some future that they could not face.",
    "And yet somehow we do not seem to get at something\nbeyond what is possible but not yet what is probable.",
    "If there was anyone else in the house anyone else\nat the time the police my friends that is to say who have known the investigation at the time say that\nnothing told was really compatible with anything else but with the facts.",
    "For some reason those two\ndidnt want to go on living.",
    "Why I knew a couple said Mrs. Oliver in the warthe second war I\nmeanthey thought that the Germans would land in England and they had decided if that happened they\nwould kill themselves.",
    "I said it was very stupid.",
    "They said it would be impossible to go on living.",
    "It still\nseems to me stupid.",
    "Youve got to have enough courage to live through something.",
    "I mean its not as\nthough your death was going to do any good to anybody else.",
    "I wonder Yes what do you\nwonder Well when I said that I wondered suddenly if General and Lady Ravenscrofts deaths did any\ngood to anyone else.",
    "You mean somebody inherited money from them Yes.",
    "Not quite as blatant as\nthat.",
    "Perhaps somebody would have a better chance of doing well in life.",
    "Something there was in their life\nthat they didnt want either of their two children ever to hear about or to know about.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "The trouble with you is he said you think so often of something that well might have occurred that\nmight have been.",
    "You give me ideas.",
    "Possible ideas.",
    "If only they were probable ideas also.",
    "Why Why\nwere the deaths of those two necessary Why is itthey were not in pain they were not in illness they\nwere not deeply unhappy from what one can see.",
    "Then why in the evening of a beautiful day did they go for a walk to a cliff and taking the dog with\nthem... Whats the dog got to do with it said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Well I wondered for a moment.",
    "Did they take the dog or did the dog follow them Where does the\ndog come in I suppose it comes in like the wigs said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Just one more thing that you cant explain and doesnt seem to make sense.",
    "One of my elephants said the\ndog was devoted to Lady Ravenscroft but another one said the dog bit her.",
    "One always comes back\nto the same thing said Poirot.",
    "One wants to know more.",
    "He sighed.",
    "One wants to know more about the people and how can you\nknow people separated from you by a gulf of years Well youve done it once or twice havent you\nsaid Mrs. Oliver.",
    "You knowsomething about where a painter was shot or poisoned.",
    "That was near the\nsea on a sort of fortification or something.",
    "You found out who did that although you didnt know any of\nthe people.",
    "No.",
    "I didnt know any of the people but I learned about them from the other people who\nwere there.",
    "Well thats what Im trying to do said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Only I cant get near enough.",
    "I cant get to anyone who really knew anything who was really involved.",
    "Do you think really we ought to give it up I think it would be very wise to give it up said Poirot but\nthere is a moment when one no longer wants to be wise.",
    "One wants to find out more.",
    "I have an interest now in that couple of kindly people with two nice\nchildren.",
    "I presume they are nice children I dont know the boy said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I dont think Ive\never met him.",
    "Do you want to see my goddaughter I could send her to see you if you like.",
    "Yes I\nthink I would like to see her meet her some way.",
    "Perhaps she would not wish to come and see me but a meeting could be brought about.",
    "It might I think\nbe interesting.",
    "And there is someone else I would like to see.",
    "Oh Who is that The woman at the party.",
    "The bossy\nwoman.",
    "Your bossy friend.",
    "Shes no friend of mine said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She just came up and spoke to\nme thats all.",
    "You could resume acquaintance with her Murder in Retrospect.",
    "Oh yes quite easily.",
    "I would think shed probably jump at it.",
    "I would like to see her.",
    "I would like to\nknow why she wants to know these things.",
    "Yes.",
    "I suppose that might be useful.",
    "Anyway Mrs.\nOliver sighedI shall be glad to have a rest from elephants.",
    "Nannyyou know the old Nanny I talked aboutshe mentioned elephants and that elephants didnt\nforget.",
    "That sort of silly sentence is beginning to haunt me.",
    "Ah well you must look for more elephants.",
    "Its your turn.",
    "And what about you Perhaps I could look for swans.",
    "Mow dieu where do swans\ncome in It is only what I remember which Nanny reminded me of.",
    "That there were little boys I used to play with and one used to call me Lady Elephant and the other one\nused to call me Lady Swan.",
    "When I was Lady Swan I pretended to be swimming about on the floor.",
    "When I was Lady Elephant they rode on my back.",
    "There are no swans in this.",
    "That is a good thing\nsaid Poirot.",
    "Elephants are quite enough.",
    "CHAPTER X Desmond\nTwelve days later as Hercule Poirot drank his morning chocolate he read at the same time a letter that\nhad been among his correspondence that morning.",
    "He was reading it now for the second time.",
    "The\nhandwriting was a moderately good one though it hardly bore the stamp of maturity.",
    "Dear Monsieur Poirot I am afraid you will find this letter of mine somewhat peculiar but I believe it\nwould help if I mentioned a friend of yours.",
    "I tried to get in touch with her to ask her if she would arrange\nfor me to come and see you but apparently she had left home.",
    "Her secretaryI am referring to Mrs.\nAriadne Oliver the novelisther secretary seemed to say something about her having gone on a safari in\nEast Africa.",
    "If so I can see she may not return for some time.",
    "But Im sure she would help me.",
    "I would\nindeed like to see you so much.",
    "I am badly in need of advice of some kind.",
    "Mrs. Oliver I understand is acquainted with my mother who met her at a literary luncheon party.",
    "If you\ncould give me an appointment to visit you one day I should be very grateful.",
    "I can suit my time to\nanything you suggested.",
    "I dont know if it is helpful at all but Mrs. Olivers secretary did mention the\nword elephants.",
    "I presume this has something to do with Mrs. Olivers travels in East Africa.",
    "The\nsecretary spoke as though it was some kind of password.",
    "I dont really understand this but perhaps you\nwill.",
    "I am in a great state of worry and anxiety and I would be very grateful if you could see me.",
    "Yours truly Desmond BurtonCox.",
    "Nom dun petit bonhomme said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I beg your pardon sir said George.",
    "A mere ejaculation said Hercule Poirot.",
    "There are some things once they have invaded your life\nwhich you find very difficult to get rid of again.",
    "With me it seems to be a question of elephants.",
    "He left\nthe breakfast table summoned his faithful secretary Miss Lemon handed her the letter from Desmond\nCox and gave her directions to arrange an appointment with the writer of the letter.",
    "I am not too occupied at the present time he said.",
    "Tomorrow will be quite suitable.",
    "Miss Lemon reminded him of two appointments which he already had\nbut agreed that that left plenty of hours vacant and she would arrange something as he wished.",
    "Something to do with the Zoological Gardens she inquired.",
    "Hardly said Poirot.",
    "No do not mention elephants in your letter.",
    "There can be too much of anything.",
    "Elephants are large animals.",
    "They occupy a great deal of the horizon.",
    "Yes.",
    "We can leave elephants.",
    "They will no doubt arise in the course of the conversation I propose to hold with\nDesmond BurtonCox.",
    "Mr. Desmond BurtonCox announced George ushering in the expected\nguest.",
    "Poirot had risen to his feet and was standing beside the mantelpiece.",
    "He remained for a moment or two\nwithout speaking then he advanced having summed up his own impression.",
    "A somewhat nervous and\nenergetic personality.",
    "Quite naturally so Poirot thought.",
    "A little ill at ease but managing to mask it very successfully.",
    "He said\nextending a hand Mr. Hercule Poirot That is right said Poirot.",
    "And your name is Desmond\nBurtonCox.",
    "Pray sit down and tell me what I can do for you the reasons why you have come to see\nme.",
    "Its all going to be rather difficult to explain said Desmond BurtonCox.",
    "So many things are difficult to explain said Hercule Poirot but we have plenty of time.",
    "Sit down.",
    "Desmond looked rather doubtfully at the figure confronting him.",
    "Really a very comic personality he\nthought.",
    "The eggshaped head the big moustaches.",
    "Not somehow very imposing.",
    "Not quite in fact what he had expected to encounter.",
    "Youyou are a detective arent you he said.",
    "I mean youyou find out things.",
    "People come to you to\nfind out or to ask you to find out things for them.",
    "Yes said Poirot that is one of my tasks in life.",
    "I\ndont suppose that you know what Ive come about or that you know anything much about me.",
    "I know\nsomething said Poirot.",
    "You mean Mrs. Oliver your friend Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Shes told you something She told me that she had\nhad an interview with a goddaughter others a Miss Celia Ravenscroft.",
    "That is right is it not Yes.",
    "Yes\nCelia told me.",
    "This Mrs. Oliver is shedoes she also know my motherknow her well I mean No.",
    "I\ndo not think that they know each other well.",
    "Accord108\ning to Mrs. Oliver she met her at a literary luncheon recently and had a few words with her.",
    "Your\nmother I understand made a certain request to Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Shed no business to do so said the boy.",
    "His eyebrows came down over his nose.",
    "He looked angry now angryalmost revengeful.",
    "Really he said MothersI mean I understand said Poirot.",
    "There is much feeling these days\nindeed perhaps there always has been.",
    "Mothers are continually doing things which their children would\nmuch rather they did not do.",
    "Am I right Oh youre right enough.",
    "But my motherI mean she\ninterferes in things in which really she has no concern.",
    "You and Celia Ravenscroft I understand are\nclose friends.",
    "Mrs. Oliver understood from your mother that there was some question of marriage.",
    "Perhaps in the near\nfuture Yes but my mother really doesnt need to ask questions and worry about things which\narewell no concern of hers.",
    "But mothers are like that said Poirot.",
    "He smiled faintly.",
    "He added You are perhaps very much attached to your mother I wouldnt say that said Desmond.",
    "No I certainly wouldnt say that.",
    "You seewell Id better tell you straightaway shes not really my\nmother.",
    "Oh indeed.",
    "I had not understood that.",
    "Im adopted said Desmond.",
    "She had a son.",
    "A little\nboy who died.",
    "And then she wanted to adopt a child so I was adopted and she brought me up as her\nson.",
    "She always speaks of me as her son and thinks of me as her son but Im not really her son.",
    "Were\nnot a bit alike.",
    "We dont look at things the same way.",
    "Very understandable said Poirot.",
    "I dont seem to be getting on said Desmond with what I want to ask you.",
    "You want me to do\nsomething to find out something to cover a certain line of interrogation I suppose that does cover it.",
    "I\ndont know how much you know aboutabout well what the trouble is all about.",
    "I know a little said\nPoirot.",
    "Not details.",
    "I do not know very much about you or about Miss Ravenscroft whom I have not\nyet met.",
    "Id like to meet her.",
    "Yes well I was thinking of bringing her to talk to you but I thought Id\nbetter talk to you myself first.",
    "Well that seems quite sensible said Poirot.",
    "You are unhappy about\nsomething Worried You have difficulties Not really.",
    "No.",
    "No there shouldnt be any difficulties.",
    "There arent any.",
    "What happened is a thing that happened years ago when Celia was only a child or a\nschoolgirl at least.",
    "And there was a tragedy the sort of thing that happens well it happens every day any time.",
    "Two\npeople you know whom something has upset very much and they commit suicide.",
    "A sort of suicide pact this was.",
    "Nobody knew very much about it or why or anything like that.",
    "But after\nall it happens and its no business really of peoples children to worry about it.",
    "I mean if they know the\nfacts thats quite enough I should think.",
    "And its no business of my mothers at all.",
    "As one journeys\nthrough life said Poirot one finds more and more that people are often interested in things that are none\nof their own business.",
    "Even more so than they are in things that could be considered as their own\nbusiness.",
    "But this is all over.",
    "Nobody knew much about it or anything.",
    "But you see my mother keeps asking questions.",
    "Wants to know things and shes got at Celia.",
    "Shes got\nCelia into a state where she doesnt really know whether she wants to marry me or not.",
    "And you You\nknow if you want to marry her still Yes of course I know.",
    "I mean to marry her.",
    "Im quite determined\nto marry her.",
    "But shes got upset.",
    "She wants to know things.",
    "She wants to know why all this happened\nand she thinksIm sure shes wrongshe thinks that my mother knows something about it.",
    "That shes\nheard something about it.",
    "Well I have much sympathy for you said Poirot but it seems to me that if you are sensible young\npeople and if you want to marry there is no reason why you should not.",
    "I may say that I have been given\nsome information at my request about this sad tragedy.",
    "As you say it is a matter that happened many\nyears ago.",
    "There was no full explanation of it.",
    "There never has been.",
    "But in life one cannot have explanations of all the sad things that happen.",
    "It was a\nsuicide pact said the boy.",
    "It couldnt have been anything else.",
    "Butwell... You want to know the\ncause of it.",
    "Is that it Well yes thats it.",
    "Thats what Celias been worried about and shes almost made\nme worried.",
    "Certainly my mother is worried though as Ive said its absolutely no business of hers.",
    "I\ndont think any fault is attached to anyone.",
    "I mean there wasnt a row or anything.",
    "The trouble is of\ncourse that we dont know.",
    "Well I mean I shouldnt know anyway because I wasnt there.",
    "You didnt\nknow General and Lady Ravenscroft or Celia Ive known Celia more or less all my life.",
    "You see the\npeople I went to for holidays and her people lived next door to each other when we were very young.",
    "You knowjust children.",
    "And we always liked each other and got on together and all that.",
    "And then of\ncourse for a long time all that passed over.",
    "I didnt meet Celia for a great many years after that.",
    "Her\nparents you see were in Malaya and so were mine.",
    "I think they met each other again thereI mean my father and mother.",
    "My fathers dead by the way.",
    "But\nI think when my mother was in India she heard things and shes remembered now what she heard and\nshes worked herself up about them and she sort ofsort of thinks things that cant possibly be true.",
    "Im\nsure they arent true.",
    "But shes determined to worry Celia about them.",
    "I want to know what really\nhappened.",
    "Celia wants to know what really happened.",
    "What it was all about.",
    "And why And how Not just\npeoples silly stories.",
    "Yes said Poirot it is not unnatural perhaps that you should both feel that.",
    "Celia\nI should imagine more than you.",
    "She is more disturbed by it than you are.",
    "But if I may say so does it really matter What matters is the\nnow the present.",
    "The girl you want to marry the girl who wants to marry youwhat has the past to do\nwith you Does it matter whether her parents had a suicide pact or whether they died in an airplane\n\n\faccident or one of them was killed in an accident and the other one later committed suicide Whether\nthere were love affairs which came into their lives and made for unhappiness.",
    "Yes said Desmond\nBurtonCox yes I think what you say is sensible and quite right butwell things have been built up in\nsuch a way that Ive got to make sure that Celia is satisfied.",
    "Shesshes a person who minds about\nthings although she doesnt talk about them much.",
    "Has it not occurred to you said Hercule Poirot\nthat it may be very difficult if not impossible to find out what really happened You mean which of\nthem killed the other or why or that one shot the other and then himself.",
    "Not unlessnot unless there had\nbeen something Yes but that something would have been in the past so why does it matter now It\noughtnt to matterit wouldnt matter but for my mother interfering poking about in things.",
    "It wouldnt\nhave mattered.",
    "I dont suppose that well Celias ever thought much about it.",
    "I think probably that she was away at school in Switzerland at the time the tragedy happened and\nnobody told her much and well when youre a teenager or younger still you just accept things as\nsomething that happened but thats not anything to do with you really.",
    "Then dont you think that\nperhaps youre wanting the impossible I want you to find out said Desmond.",
    "Perhaps its not the\nkind of thing that you can find out or that you like finding out I have no objection to finding out said\nPoirot.",
    "In fact one has even a certain\u2014curiosity shall I say.",
    "Tragedies things that arise as a matter of\ngrief surprise shock illness\u2014they are human tragedies human things and it is only natural that if ones\nattention is drawn to them one should want to know.",
    "What I say is is it wise or necessary to rake up\nthings Perhaps it isnt said Desmond but you see... And also said Poirot interrupting him dont\nyou agree with me that it is rather an impossible thing to do after all this time No said Desmond\nthats where I dont agree with you.",
    "I think it would be quite possible.",
    "Very interesting said Poirot.",
    "Why do you think it would be quite possible Because\u2014 Of what You have a reason.",
    "I think\nthere are people who would know.",
    "I think there are people who could tell you if they were willing to tell\nyou.",
    "People perhaps who would not wish to tell me who would not wish to tell Celia but you might find out\nfrom them.",
    "That is interesting said Poirot.",
    "Things happened said Desmond.",
    "Things happened in the past.",
    "I\u2014Ive sort of heard about them in a\nvague way.",
    "There was some mental trouble.",
    "There was someone\u2014I dont know who exactly I think it might have\nbeen Lady Ravenscroft\u2014I think she was in a mental home for years.",
    "Quite a long time.",
    "Some tragedy\nhad happened when she was quite young.",
    "Some child who died or an accident.",
    "Something that\u2014 well\nshe was concerned in it in some way.",
    "It is not what you know of your own knowledge I presume\nNo.",
    "Its something my mother said.",
    "Something she heard.",
    "She heard it in India I think.",
    "Gossip there from other people.",
    "You know how they get together in the Services people like that and the women all gossip together\u2014all\nthe memsahibs.",
    "Saying things that mightnt be true at all.",
    "And you want to know whether they were true or were not\ntrue Yes and I dont know how to find out myself.",
    "Not now because it was a long time ago and I\ndont know who to ask.",
    "I dont know who to go to but until we really find out what did happen and\nwhy What you mean is said Poirot at least I think I am right only this is pure surmise on my part\nCelia Ravenscroft does not want to marry you unless she is quite sure that there is no mental flaw passed\nto her presumably by her mother.",
    "Is that it I think that is what she has got into her head somehow.",
    "And I think my mother put it there.",
    "I think its what my mother wants to believe.",
    "I dont think shes any\nreason really for believing it except illmannered spite and gossip and all the rest of it.",
    "It will not be a\nvery easy thing to investigate said Poirot.",
    "No but Ive heard things about you.",
    "They say that youre very clever at rinding out what did happen.",
    "Asking people questions and getting them to tell you things.",
    "Whom do you suggest I should question or\nask When you say India I presume you are not referring to people of Indian nationality.",
    "You are\nspeaking of what you might call the memsahib days the days when there were Service communities in\nIndia.",
    "You are speaking of English people and the gossip in some English station there.",
    "I dont really\nmean that that would be any good now.",
    "I think whoever it was who gossiped who talkedI mean its\nso long ago now that theyd have forgotten all about it that they are probably dead themselves.",
    "I think\nthat my mothers got a lot of things wrong that shes heard things and made up more things about them in\nher mind.",
    "And you still think that I would be capable Well I dont mean that I want you to go out to\nIndia and ask people things.",
    "I mean none of the people would be there now.",
    "So you think you could not give me names Not those sort of names said Desmond.",
    "But some names Well Ill come out with what I mean.",
    "I think there are two people who might know\nwhat happened and why.",
    "Because you see theyd have been there.",
    "Theyd have known really known\nof their own knowledge.",
    "You do not want to go to them yourself Well I could.",
    "I have in a way but I\ndont think you see that they\u2014I dont know.",
    "I wouldnt like to ask some of the things I want to ask.",
    "I\ndont think Celia would.",
    "Theyre very nice and thats why theyd know.",
    "Not because theyre nasty not\nbecause they gossip but because they might have helped.",
    "They might have done something to make things better or have tried to do so only they couldnt.",
    "Oh Im\nputting it all so badly.",
    "No said Poirot you are doing it very well and I am interested and I think you\nhave something definite in your mind.",
    "Tell me does Celia Ravenscroft agree with you I havent said\ntoo much to her.",
    "You see she was very fond of Maddy and of Zeiie.",
    "Maddy and Zeiie Oh well\nthats their names.",
    "Oh I must explain.",
    "I havent done it very well.",
    "You see when Celia was quite a\nchild\u2014at the time when I first knew her as I say when we were living next door in the country\u2014she had\na French sort of\u2014well I suppose nowadays we call it an au pair girl but it was called a governess then.",
    "You know a French governess.",
    "A mademoiselle.",
    "And you see she was very nice.",
    "She played with all of us children and Celia always called her Maddy\nfor short\u2014and all the family called her Maddy.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "The mademoiselle.",
    "Yes you see being\nFrench I thought\u2014I thought perhaps she would tell you things that she knew and wouldnt wish to speak\nabout to other people.",
    "Ah.",
    "And the other name you mentioned Zeiie.",
    "The same sort of thing you\nsee.",
    "A mademoiselle.",
    "Maddy was there I think for about two or three years and then later she went back to France or\nSwitzerland I think it was and this other one came.",

    "And so you see shed know\u2014what really happened.",
    "And you know her\naddress You know where she is now Yes.",

    "Oh dear its a pity though isnt it She said again We do\nhave too much material dont we Yes said Poirot.",
    "We do not know what we are looking for.",
    "All\nwe know of still is in all probability the double suicide of a married couple who lived quiet and happy\nlives together.",
    "And what have we got to show for cause for reason\nWeve gone forward and back to the right to the left to the west to the east.",
    "Quite right said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Everywhere.",
    "We havent been to the North Pole yet she added.",
    "Nor to the South Pole said Poirot.",
    "So what is there when it all comes to it Various things said Poirot.",
    "I have made here a list.",
    "Do you\nwant to read it Mrs. Oliver came over and sat beside him and looked over his shoulder.",
    "Wigs she said pointing to the first item.",
    "Why wigs first Four wigs said Poirot seem to be\ninteresting.",
    "Interesting and rather difficult to solve.",
    "I believe the shop she got her wigs from has gone out\nof the trade now.",
    "People go to quite different places for wigs and theyre not wearing so many as they did\njust then.",
    "People used to wear wigs to go abroad.",
    "You know because it saves bother in traveling.",
    "Yes\nyes said Poirot we will do what we can with wigs.",
    "Anyway that is one thing that interests me.",
    "And then there are other stories.",
    "Stories of mental\ndisturbance in the family.",
    "Stories of a twin sister who was mentally disturbed and spent a good many years of her life in a mental\nhome.",
    "It doesnt seem to lead anywhere said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I mean to say I suppose she could have\ncome and shot the two of them but I dont really see why.",
    "No said Poirot the fingerprints on the\nrevolver were definitely only the fingerprints of General Ravenscroft and his wife I understand.",
    "Then\nthere are stories of a child.",
    "A child in India was murdered or attacked possibly by this twin sister of\nLady Ravenscroft.",
    "Possibly by some quite different womanpossibly by an ayah or a servant.",
    "Point two.",
    "You know a little more about money.",
    "Where does money come into it said Mrs. Oliver in some\nsurprise.",
    "It does not come into it said Poirot.",
    "That is what is so interesting.",
    "Money usually comes in.",
    "Money\nsomeone got as a result of that suicide.",
    "Money lost as a result of it.",
    "Money somewhere causing\ndifficulties causing trouble causing covetousness and desire.",
    "It is difficult that.",
    "Difficult to see.",
    "There does not seem to have been any large amount of money anywhere.",
    "There are various stories of\nlove affairs women who were attractive to the husband men who were attractive to the wife.",
    "An affair\nthere one side or the other could have led to suicide or to murder.",
    "It very often does.",
    "Then we come to\nwhat at the moment inclines me to the most interest.",
    "That is why I am so anxious to meet Mrs.\nBurtonCox.",
    "Oh.",
    "That awful woman.",
    "I dont see why you think shes important.",
    "All she did was to go\nbeing a noseyparker and wanting me to find out things.",
    "Yes but why did she want you to find out\nthings It seems to me very odd that.",
    "It seems to me that that is something that one has to find out about.",
    "She is the link you see.",
    "The link Yes.",
    "We do not know what the link was where it was how it was.",
    "All we know is that she wants desperately to learn more about this suicide.",
    "Being a link she connects\nboth with your godchild Celia Ravenscroft and with the son who is not her son.",
    "What do you\nmean\u2014not her son He is an adopted son said Poirot.",
    "A son she adopted because her own son\ndied How did her own child die Why When All these things I asked myself.",
    "She could be a link a\nlink of emotion a wish for revenge through hatred through some love affair.",
    "At any rate I must see her.",
    "I\nmust make up my mind about her.",
    "Yes.",
    "I cannot help but think that is very important.",
    "There was a ring\nat the bell and Mrs. Oliver went out of the room to answer it.",
    "This I think could be Celia she said.",
    "Youre sure its all right By me yes said Poirot.",
    "By her\nalso I hope.",
    "Mrs. Oliver came back a few minutes later.",
    "Celia Ravenscroft was with her.",
    "She had a\ndoubtful suspicious look.",
    "I dont know she said if I\u2014 She stopped staring at Hercule Poirot.",
    "I want to introduce you said Mrs. Oliver to someone who is helping me and I hope is helping you\nalso.",
    "That is helping you in what you want to know and to find out.",
    "This is Monsieur Hercule Poirot.",
    "He\nhas special genius in finding out things.",
    "Oh said Celia.",
    "She looked very doubtfully at the eggshaped head the monstrous moustaches and the small stature.",
    "I think she said rather doubtfully that I have heard of him.",
    "Hercule Poirot stopped himself with a\nslight effort from saying firmly Most people have heard of me.",
    "It was not quite as true as it used to be\nbecause many people who had heard of Hercule Poirot and known him were now reposing with suitable\nmemorial stones over them in churchyards.",
    "He said Sit down mademoiselle.",
    "I will tell you this much\nabout myself.",
    "That when I start an investigation I pursue it to the end.",
    "I will bring to light the truth and if it\nis shall we say truly the truth that you want then I will deliver that knowledge to you.",
    "But it may be that\nyou want reassuring.",
    "That is not the same thing as the truth.",
    "I can find various aspects that might reassure you.",
    "Will that be\nenough If so do not ask for more.",
    "Celia sat down in the chair he had pushed towards her and looked\nat him rather earnestly.",
    "Then she said You dont think Id care for the truth is that it I think said\nPoirot that the truth might bea shock a sorrow and it might be that you would have said why did I\nnot leave all this behind Why did I ask for knowledge It is painful knowledge about which I can do\nnothing helpful or hopeful.",
    "It is a double suicide by a father and a mother that Iwell well admit itthat\nI loved.",
    "It is not a disadvantage to love a mother and father.",
    "It seems to be considered so nowadays\noccasionally said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "New article of belief shall we say.",
    "Thats the way Ive been living\nsaid Celia.",
    "Beginning to wonder you know.",
    "Catching on to odd things that people said sometimes.",
    "People who looked at me rather pityingly.",
    "But more than that.",
    "With curiosity as well.",
    "One begins to find\nout you know things about people I mean.",
    "People you meet people you know people who used to\nknow your family.",
    "I dont want this life.",
    "I want... you think I dont really want it but I doI want truth.",
    "Im able to deal with truth.",
    "Just tell me something.",
    "It was not a continuation of the conversation.",
    "Celia\nhad turned on Poirot with a separate question.",
    "Something which had replaced what had been in her mind\njust previously.",
    "You saw Desmond didnt you she said.",
    "He went to see you.",
    "He told me he had.",
    "Yes.",
    "He came to\nsee me.",
    "Did you not want him to do so He didnt ask me.",
    "If he had asked you I dont know.",
    "I\ndont know whether I should have forbid128 den iii11 to do s0told lm on n0 account to do such a\nthing or whether I should have encouraged it.",
    "I would like to ask you one question mademoiselle.",
    "I\nwant to know if there is one clear thing in your mind that matters to you that could matter to you more\nthan anything else.",
    "Vell what is that as you say Desmond BurtonCox came to see me.",
    "A very\nattract\u00ae d likeable young man and very much in earnest over what he came to say.",
    "Now thatthat is\nthe really important thing.",
    "The important thing is if you and he really wish to marrybecause that is\nserious.",
    "That isthough young people do not always think so nowadaysthat is a link together for life.",
    "D\u00b0 y011 want to enter into that state It matters.",
    "What difference can it make to you or to Desmond\nwhether the death of tw0 Pple was a double suicide or something quite different You think it is\nsomething quite differentor it was I do not as yet know said Poirot.",
    "I have reason to believe that it\nmight be.",
    "There are certain things that do not accord with a double suicide but as far as I can go on the\nopinion of the policeand the police are very reliable Mademoiselle Celia very reliablethey put\ntogether all the evidence and they thought very definitely that it could be nothing else but a double\nsuicide.",
    "But they never knew the cause of it Thats what you mean Yes said Poirot thats what I\nmean.",
    "Afld dont you know the cause of it either I mean from looking lnto things or thinking about\nthem or whatever you do No I am not sure about it said Poirot.",
    "I think there might be something\nvery painful to learn and I am asking you whether you will be wise enough to say The past is the past.",
    "Here is a young man whom I care for and who cares for me.",
    "This is the future we are spending together not the past.",
    "Did be tell you he was an adopted child\nasked Celia.",
    "Yes he did.",
    "You see what business is it really of hers Why should she come worrying Mrs. Oliver\nhere trying to make Mrs.\nOliver ask me questions find out things.",
    "Shes not his own mother.",
    "Does he care for her No said\nCelia.",
    "Id say on the whole he dislikes her.",
    "I think he always has.",
    "Shes spent money on him schooling\nand on clothes and on all sorts of different things.",
    "And you think she cares for him I dont know.",
    "I\ndont think so.",
    "She wanted I suppose a child to replace her own child.",
    "Shed had a child who died in an\naccident that was why she wanted to adopt someone and her husband had died quite recently.",
    "All these\ndates are so difficult.",
    "I know I know.",
    "I would like perhaps to know one thing.",
    "About her or about\n\n\fhim Is he provided for financially I dont know quite what you mean by that.",
    "Hell be able to\nsupport me\u2014to support a wife.",
    "I gather some money was settled on him when he was adopted.",
    "A\nsufficient sum that is.",
    "I dont mean a fortune or anything like that.",
    "There is nothing that she\ncould\u2014withhold What you mean that shed cut off the money supplies if he married me I dont think\nshes ever threatened to do that or indeed that she could do it.",
    "I think it was all fixed up by lawyers or\nwhoever arranges adoptions.",
    "I mean they make a lot of fuss these adoption societies from all I hear.",
    "I\nwould ask you something else which you might know but nobody else does.",
    "Presumably Mrs.\nBurtonCox knows it.",
    "Do you know who his actual mother was You think that might have been one of\nthe reasons for her being so nosey and all that Something to do with as you say what he was really.",
    "I\ndont know.",
    "I suppose he might have been an illegitimate child.",
    "Theyre the usual ones that go for\nadoption arent they She might have known something about his real mother or his real father or\nsomething like that.",
    "If so she didnt tell him.",
    "I gather she just told him the silly things they suggest you\nshould say.",
    "That it is just as nice to be adopted because it shows you really were wanted.",
    "Theres a lot\nof silly slop like that.",
    "I think some societies suggest that thats the way you should break the news.",
    "Does\nhe or you know of any blood relations I dont know.",
    "I dont think he knows but I dont think it\nworries him at all.",
    "Hes not that kind of a worrier.",
    "Do you know if Mrs. BurtonCox was a friend of\nyour family of your mother and father Did you ever meet her as far as you can remember when you\nwere living in your own home in the early days I dont think so.",
    "I think Desmonds mother\u2014I mean I\nthink Mrs. BurtonCox went to Malaya.",
    "I think perhaps her husband died out in Malaya and that\nDesmond was sent to school in England while they were out there and that he was boarded with some\ncousins or people who take in children for holidays.",
    "And thats how we came to be friends in those days.",
    "I always remembered him you know.",
    "I was a great heroworshiper.",
    "He was wonderful at climbing trees and he taught me things about birds nests and birds eggs.",
    "So it\nseemed quite natural when I met him again I mean met him at the university and we both talked about\nwhere wed lived and then he asked me my name.",
    "He said Only your Christian name I know and then\nwe remembered quite a lot of things together.",
    "Its what made us you might say get acquainted.",
    "I dont\nknow everything about him.",
    "I dont know anything.",
    "I want to know.",
    "How can you arrange your life and\nknow what youre going to do with your life if you dont know all about the things that affect you that\nreally happened So you tell me to carry on with my investigation Yes if its going to produce any\nresults though I dont think it will because in a way well Desmond and I have tried our hand at finding\nout a few things.",
    "We havent been very successful.",
    "It seems to come back to this plain fact which isnt\nreally the story of a life.",
    "Its the story of a death isnt it Of two deaths thats to say.",
    "When its a double\nsuicide one thinks of it as one death.",
    "Is it in Shakespeare or where does the quotation come\nfrom\u2014And in death they were not divided She turned to Poirot again.",
    "Yes go on.",
    "Go on finding out.",
    "Go on telling Mrs. Oliver or telling me direct.",
    "Id rather you told me direct.",
    "She turned\ntowards Mrs. Olivet.",
    "I dont mean to be horrid to you Godmother.",
    "Youve been a very nice godmother to me always but\u2014but Id like it straight from the horses mouth.",
    "Im\nafraid thats rather rude Monsieur Poirot but I didnt mean it that way.",
    "No said Poirot I am content\nto be the horses mouth.",
    "And you think you will be I always believe that I can.",
    "And its always true\nis it It is usually true said Poirot.",
    "I do not say more than that.",
    "CHAPTER XIII Mrs. BurtonCox\nWell said Mrs. Oliver as she returned to the room after seeing Celia to the door.",
    "What do you think\nof her She is.a personality said Poirot an interesting girl.",
    "Definitely if I may put it so she is somebody not anybody.",
    "Yes thats true enough said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I would like you to tell me something.",
    "About her I dont really know her very well.",
    "One doesnt really\nwith godchildren.",
    "I mean you only see them as it were at stated intervals rather far apart.",
    "I didnt\nmean her.",
    "Tell me about her mother.",
    "Oh.",
    "I see.",
    "You knew her mother Yes.",
    "We were in a sort of\npensionnat in Paris together.",
    "People used to send girls to Paris then to be finished said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "That sounds more like an\nintroduction to a cemetery than an introduction into society.",
    "What do you want to know about her\nYou remember her You remember what she was like Yes.",
    "As I tell you one doesnt entirely forget\nthings or.",
    "people because theyre in the past.",
    "What impression did she make on you She was beautiful said\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "I do remember that.",
    "Not when she was about thirteen or fourteen.",
    "She had a lot of puppy\nfat then.",
    "I think we all did she added thoughtfully.",
    "Was she a personality Its difficult to remember because you see she wasnt my only friend or my\ngreatest friend.",
    "I mean there were several of us togethera little pack as you might say.",
    "People with\ntastes more or less the same.",
    "We were keen on tennis and we were keen on being taken to the opera\nand we were bored to death being taken to the picture galleries.",
    "I really can only give you a general\nidea.",
    "Molly PrestonGrey.",
    "That was her name.",
    "Had few boy friends We had one or two passions I\nthink.",
    "Not for pop singers of course.",
    "They hadnt happened yet.",
    "Actors usually.",
    "There was one rather\nfamous variety actor.",
    "A girlone of the girls had him pinned up over her bed and Mademoiselle\nGirand the French mistress on no account allowed that actor to be pinned up there.",
    "Ce nest pas\nconvenable she said.",
    "The girl didnt tell her that he was her father We laughed added Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Yes we laughed a good deal.",
    "Well tell me more about Molly or Margaret PrestonGrey.",
    "Does this girl remind you of her No I dont think she does.",
    "No.",
    "They are not alike.",
    "I think Molly was\nmorewas more emotional than this girl.",
    "There was a twin sister I understand.",
    "Was she at the same\npensionnat No she wasnt.",
    "She might have been since they were the same age but no I think she\nwas in some entirely different place in England.",
    "Im not sure.",
    "I have a feeling that the twin sister Dolly\nwhom I had met once or twice very occasionally and who of course at that time looked exactly like\nMollyI mean they hadnt started trying to look different have different hairdos and all that as twins do\nusually when they grow up.",
    "I think Molly was devoted to her sister Dolly but she didnt talk about her\nvery much.",
    "I have a feelingnowadays I mean I didnt have it thenthat there might have been\nsomething a bit wrong perhaps with the sister even then.",
    "Once or twice I remember there were mentions of her having been ill or gone away for a course of\ntreatment somewhere.",
    "Something like that.",
    "I remember once wondering whether she was a cripple.",
    "She was taken once by an\naunt on a sea voyage to do her health good.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "I cant really remember though.",
    "I just\nhad a feeling that Molly was devoted to her and would have liked to have protected her in some way.",
    "Does that seem nonsense to you Not at all said Hercule Poirot.",
    "There were other times I think when she didnt want to talk about her.",
    "She talked about her mother\nand her father.",
    "She was fond of them I think in the ordinary sort of way.",
    "Her mother came once to Paris and took her out I remember.",
    "Nice woman.",
    "Not very exciting or goodlooking or anything.",
    "Nice quiet kindly.",
    "I see.",
    "So you have nothing to help us there Boy friends We didnt have so many\nboy friends then said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Its not like nowadays when its a matter of course.",
    "Later when we were both back again at home we more or less drifted apart.",
    "I think Molly went abroad\nsomewhere with her parents.",
    "I dont think it was IndiaI dont think so.",
    "Somewhere else I think it was.",
    "Egypt perhaps.",
    "I think now they were in the Diplomatic Service.",
    "They were in Sweden at one time and\nafter that somewhere like Bermuda or the West Indies.",
    "I think he was a governor or something there.",
    "But\nthose sort of things one doesnt really remember.",
    "All one remembers is all the silly things that we said to\neach other.",
    "I had a crush on the violin master I remember.",
    "Molly was very keen on the music master\nwhich was very satisfying to us both and I should think much less troublesome than boy friends seem to\nbe nowadays.",
    "I mean you adoredlonged for the day when they came again to teach you.",
    "They were I\nhave no doubt quite indifferent to you.",
    "But one dreamt about them at night and I remember having a\nsplendid kind of daydream in which I nursed my beloved Monsieur Adolphe when he had cholera and I\ngave him I think blood transfusions to save his life.",
    "How very silly one is.",
    "And think of all the other\nthings you think of doing There was one time when I was quite determined to be a nun and later on I\nthought Id be a hospital nurse.",
    "Well I suppose we shall have Mrs. BurtonCox in a moment.",
    "I wonder\nhow she will react to you Poirot gazed at his watch.",
    "We shall be able to see that fairly soon.",
    "Have we anything else we ought to talk about first I think\nthere are a few things we might compare notes on.",
    "As I say there are one or two things that I think could\ndo with investigation.",
    "An elephant investigation for you shall we say And an understudy for an elephant\nfor me.",
    "What an extraordinary thing to say said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I told you I was done with elephants.",
    "Ah said Poirot but elephants perhaps have not done with you.",
    "The front doorbell sounded once\nagain.",
    "Poirot and Mrs.\nOliver looked at each other.",
    "Well said Mrs. Oliver here we go.",
    "She left the room once more.",
    "Poirot heard sounds of greeting\ngoing on outside and in a moment or two Mrs. Oliver returned ushering the somewhat massive figure of\nMrs.\nBurtonCox.",
    "What a delightful flat you have said Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "So charming of you to have spared timeyour very valuable time Im sureand asked me to come and\nsee you.",
    "Her eyes shot sideways to Hercule Poirot.",
    "A faint expression of surprise passed over her face.",
    "For a moment her eyes went from him to the baby grand piano that stood in one window.",
    "It occurred to\nMrs. Oliver that Mrs. BurtonCox was thinking that Hercule Poirot was a piano tuner.",
    "She hastened to\ndispel this illusion.",
    "I want to introduce you she said to Mr. Hercule Poirot.",
    "Poirot came forward and bent over her\nhand.",
    "I think he is the only person who might be able to help you in some way.",
    "You know.",
    "What you were\nasking me about the other day concerning my godchild Celia Ravenscroft.",
    "Oh yes how kind of you to\nremember.",
    "I do so hope you can give me a little more knowledge of what really happened.",
    "Im afraid I\nhavent been very successful said Mrs. Oliver and that is really why I asked Mr. Poirot to meet you.",
    "He is a wonderful person you know for information on things generally.",
    "Really on top of his profession.",
    "I cannot tell you how many friends of mine he has assisted and how\nmany well I can really call them mysteries he has elucidated.",
    "And this was such a tragic thing to have\nhappened.",
    "Yes indeed said Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "Her eyes were still somewhat doubtful.",
    "Mrs. Oliver\nindicated chairs and remarked Now what will you have A glass of sherry Its too late for tea of\ncourse.",
    "Or would you prefer a cocktail of some kind Oh a glass of sherry.",
    "You are very kind.",
    "Monsieur Poirot I too said Poirot.",
    "Mrs. Oliver could not help being thankful that he had not asked for Sirop de Cassis or one of his favorite\nfruit drinks.",
    "She got out glasses and a decanter.",
    "I have already indicated to Monsieur Poirot the outlines of the inquiry you want to make.",
    "Oh yes\nsaid Mrs. BurtonCox.",
    "She seemed rather doubtful and not so sure of herself as it would seem she was in the natural habit of\nbeing.",
    "These young people she said to Poirot so difficult nowadays.",
    "These young people.",
    "My son such a\ndear boywe have great hopes of his doing well in the future.",
    "And then there is this girl a very charming\ngirl who as probably Mrs.\nOliver told you is her goddaughter and\u2014well of course one never knows.",
    "I mean these friendships\nspring up and very often they dont last.",
    "They are what we used to call calf love you know years ago\nand it is very important to know a little at least about theantecedents of people.",
    "You know what their\nfamilies are like.",
    "Oh of course I know Celias a very wellborn girl and all that but there was this\ntragedy.",
    "Mutual suicide I believe but nobody has been really able to enlighten me at all on what led to it\nor what led up to it shall we say.",
    "I have no actual friends who were friends in common with the\nRavenscrofts and so it is very difficult for me to have ideas.",
    "I know Celia is a charming girl and all that\nbut one would like to know to know more.",
    "I understand from my friend Mrs. Oliver that you wanted\nto know something specifically.",
    "You wanted to know in fact What you said you wanted to know\nsaid Mrs. Oliver chipping in with some firmness was whether Celias father shot her mother and then\nhimself or whether Celias mother shot her father and then herself.",
    "I feel it makes a difference said\nMrs. BurtonCox.",
    "Yes definitely I feel it makes a difference.",
    "A very interesting point of view said\nPoirot.",
    "His tone was not very encouraging.",
    "Oh the emotional background shall I say the emotional events that led up to all this.",
    "In a marriage you\nmust admit one had to think of the children.",
    "The children I mean that are to come.",
    "I mean heredity.",
    "I\nthink now we realize that heredity does more than environment.",
    "It leads to certain formation of character\nand certain very grave risks that one might not want to take.",
    "True said Poirot.",
    "The people who\nundertake the risks are the ones that have to make the decision.",
    "Your son and this young lady it will be\ntheir choice.",
    "Oh I know I know.",
    "Not mine.",
    "Parents are never allowed to choose are they or even to\ngive any advice.",
    "Bdt I would like to know something about it.",
    "Yes I would like to know very much.",
    "If\nyou feel that you could undertake anyinvestigation I suppose is the word you would use.",
    "But perhapsperhaps I am being a very foolish mother.",
    "You know.",
    "Overanxious about my dear son.",
    "Mothers are like\nthat.",
    "She gave a little whinny of laughter putting her head slightly on one side.",
    "Perhaps she said as she tipped up the sherry glass perhaps you will think about it and I also will let\n\n\fyou know.",
    "Perhaps the exact points and things that I am worried about.",
    "She looked at her watch.",
    "Oh dear.",
    "Oh dear Im late for another appointment.",
    "I shall have to go.",
    "I am so sorry dear Mrs.\nOliver to have to run away so soon but you know what it is.",
    "I had great difficulties finding a taxi this\nafternoon.",
    "One after another just turned his head aside and drove straight past me.",
    "Ah very very\ndifficult isnt it I think Mrs. Oliver has your address has she not I will give you my address said\nPoirot.",
    "He removed a card from his pocket and handed it to her.",
    "Oh yes yes.",
    "I see.",
    "Monsieur Hercule Poirot.",
    "You are French is that right I am Belgian said Poirot.",
    "Oh yes yes.",
    "Belgique.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "I quite understand.",
    "I am so pleased to have met you and I feel so\nhopeful.",
    "Oh dear I must go very very fast.",
    "Shaking Mrs. Oliver warmly by the hand then extending\nthe same hand to Poirot she left the room and the door sounded in the hall.",
    "Well what do you think of that said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "What do you said Poirot.",
    "She ran away said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She ran away.",
    "You frightened her in some way.",
    "Yes said Poirot I\nthink youve judged quite right.",
    "She wanted me to get things out of Celia she wanted me to get some\nknowledge out of Celia some expression some sort of secret she suspected was there but she doesnt\nwant a real proper investigation does she I think not said Poirot.",
    "That is interesting.",
    "Very\ninteresting.",
    "She is welltodo you think I should say so.",
    "Her clothes are expensive she lives at an\nexpensive address she is\u2014its difficult to make out.",
    "Shes a pushing woman and a bossy woman.",
    "She\nsits on a lot of committees.",
    "Theres nothing I mean suspicious about her.",
    "Ive asked a few people.",
    "Nobody likes her very much.",
    "But shes a sort of publicspirited woman who\ntakes part in politics all those sorts of things.",
    "Then what is wrong with her said Poirot.",
    "You think there is something wrong with her.",
    "Or do you just not like her like I do I think there is\nsomething there that she does not want to come to light said Poirot.",
    "Oh.",
    "And are you going to find out what it is Naturally if I can said Poirot.",
    "It may not be easy.",
    "She\nis in retreat.",
    "She was in retreat when she left us here.",
    "She was afraid of what questions I was going to ask\nher.",
    "Yes.",
    "It is interesting.",
    "He sighed.",
    "One will have to go back you know even further than one\nthought.",
    "What back into the past again Yes.",
    "Somewhere in the past in more cases than one there is\nsomething that one will have to know before we can come back again to what happened\u2014what is it\nnow\u2014fifteen years ago twenty years ago at a house called Overcliffe.",
    "Yes.",
    "One will have to go back\nagain.",
    "Well thats that said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "And now what is there to do What is this list of yours I\nhave heard a certain amount of information through police records on what was found in the house.",
    "You\nwill remember that among the things there were four wigs.",
    "Yes said Mrs. Oliver you said that four\nwigs were too many.",
    "It seemed to be a little excessive said Poirot.",
    "I have also got certain useful\naddresses.",
    "The address of a doctor that might be helpful.",
    "The doctor You mean the family doctor\nNo not the family doctor.",
    "The doctor who gave evidence at an inquest on a child who met with an\naccident.",
    "Either pushed by an older child or possibly by someone else.",
    "You mean by the mother\nPossibly the mother possibly by someone else who was in the house at the time.",
    "I know the part of\nEngland where that happened and Superintendent Garroway has been able through sources known to\nhim and also through journalistic friends of mine who were interested in this particular case to get some\ninformation about the doctor.",
    "And youre going to see him.",
    "He must be a very old man by now.",
    "It is\n\n\fnot him I shall go to see.",
    "It is his son.",
    "His son is also qualified as a specialist in various forms of mental\ndisorders.",
    "I have an introduction to him and he might be able to tell me something interesting.",
    "There have also been\ninquiries into a case of money.",
    "What do you mean by money Well there are certain things we have\nto find out.",
    "That is one of the things in anything which might be a crime.",
    "Money.",
    "Who has money to lose by some happening who has money to gain by something happening.",
    "That one\nhas to find out.",
    "Well they must have found out in the case of the Ravenscrofts.",
    "Yes that was all quite\nnatural it seems.",
    "They had both made normal wills leaving in each case the money to the other partner.",
    "The wife left her money to the husband and the husband left his money to his wife.",
    "Neither of them\nbenefited by what happened because they both died.",
    "So that the people who did profit were the\ndaughter Celia and a younger child Edward who I gather is now at a university abroad.",
    "Well that\nwont help.",
    "Neither of the children were there or could have had anything to do with it.",
    "Oh no that is\nquite true.",
    "One must go further\u2014further back further forward further sideways to find out if there is\nsome financial motive somewhere that iswell shall we say significant.",
    "Well dont ask me to do that\nsort of thing said Mrs.\nOliver.",
    "Ive no real qualifications for that.",
    "I mean thats come up I suppose fairly reasonably in\nthewell in the elephants that Ive talked to.",
    "No.",
    "I think the best thing for you to do would be to shall\nwe say take on the subject of the wigs.",
    "Wigs There had been a note made in the careful police\nreport at the time of the suppliers of the wigs who were a very expensive firm of hairdressers and\nwigmakers in London in Bond Street.",
    "Later that particular shop closed and the business was transferred\nsomewhere else.",
    "Two of the original partners continued to run it and I understand it has now been given\nup but I have here an address of one of the principal fitters and hairdressers and I thought perhaps that\nit would come more easily if inquiries were made by a woman.",
    "Ah said Mrs. Oliver me Yes\nyou.",
    "All right.",
    "What do you want me to do Pay a visit to Cheltenham to an address I shall give you\nand there you will find a Madame Rosentelle.",
    "A woman no longer young but who was a very fashionable\nmaker of ladies hair adornments of all kinds and who was married I understand to another in the same\nprofession a hairdresser who specialized in surmounting the problems of gentlemens baldness.",
    "Toupees\nand other things.",
    "Oh dear said Mrs. Oliver the jobs you do give me to do.",
    "Do you think theyll\nremember anything about it Elephants remember said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Oh and who are you going to ask questions of This doctor you talked about For one yes.",
    "And\nwhat do you think hell remember Not very much said Poirot but it seems to me possible that he\nmight have heard about a certain accident.",
    "It must have been an interesting case you know.",
    "There must\nbe records of the case history.",
    "You mean of the twin sister Yes.",
    "There were two accidents as far as\nI can hear connected with her.",
    "One when she was a young mother living in the country at Hatters Green\nI think the address was and again later when she was in India.",
    "Each time an accident which resulted in\nthe death of a child.",
    "I might learn something about You mean that as they were twin sisters that\nMollymy Molly I meanmight also have had mental disability of some kind I dont believe it for a\nminute.",
    "She wasnt like that.",
    "She was affectionate loving very goodlooking emotional andoh she\nwas a terribly nice person.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes so it would seem.",
    "And a happy person on the whole would you\nsay Yes.",
    "She was a happy person.",
    "A very happy person.",
    "Oh I know I never saw anything of her later\nin life of course she was living abroad.",
    "But it always seemed to me on the very rare occasions when I\ngot a letter or went to see her that she was a happy person.",
    "And the twin sister you did not really\nknow No.",
    "Well I think she was... well quite frankly she was in an institution of some kind I think on\nthe rare occasions that I saw Molly.",
    "She wasnt at Mollys wedding not as a bridesmaid even.",
    "That is\nodd in itself.",
    "I still dont see what youre going to find out from that.",
    "Just information said Poirot.",
    "CHAPTER XIV Dr. Willoughby\n\n\fHercule Poirot got out of the taxi paid the fare and a tip verified the fact that the address he had come\nto was the address corresponding to that written down in his little notebook took carefully a letter from\nhis pocket addressed to Dr. Willoughby mounted the steps to the house and pressed the bell.",
    "The door\nwas opened by a manservant.",
    "On reception of Poirots name he was told that Dr. Willoughby was\nexpecting him.",
    "He was shown into a small comfortable room with bookshelves up the side of it.",
    "There were two\narmchairs drawn to the fire and a tray with glasses on it and two decanters.",
    "Dr.\nWilloughby rose to greet him.",
    "He was a man between fifty and sixty with a lean thin body a high\nforehead darkhaired and with very piercing gray eyes.",
    "He shook hands and motioned him to a seat.",
    "Poirot produced the letter from his pocket.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "The doctor took it from him opened it read it and then placing it beside him looked at Poirot\nwith some interest.",
    "I had already heard he said from Superintendent Garroway and also I may say from a friend of mine\nin the Home Office who also begged me to do what I can for you in the matter that interests you.",
    "It is a\nrather serious favor to ask I know said Poirot but there are reasons which make it important for me.",
    "Important for you after this number of years Yes.",
    "Of course I shall quite understand if those particular\nevents have passed out of your mind altogether.",
    "I cant say theyve done that.",
    "I am interested as you\nmay have heard in special branches of my profession and have been for many years.",
    "Your father I\nknow was a very celebrated authority on them.",
    "Yes he was.",
    "It was a great interest in his life.",
    "He had a\nlot of theories some of them triumphantly proved right and some of them which proved disappointing.",
    "It\nis I gather a mental case you are interested in A woman.",
    "Her name was Dorothea PrestonGrey.",
    "Yes.",
    "I was quite a young man at the time.",
    "I was already interested in my fathers line of thought although\nmy theories and his did not always agree.",
    "The work he did was interesting and the work I did in\ncollaboration interested me very much.",
    "I dont know what your particular interest was in Dorothea\nPrestonGrey as she was at the time Mrs. Jarrow later.",
    "She was one of twins I gather said Poirot.",
    "Yes.",
    "That was at that moment I may say my fathers particular field of study.",
    "There was a project on\nhand at that time to follow up the general lives of selected pairs of identical twins.",
    "Those who were\nbrought up in the same environment those who through various chances of life were brought up in\nentirely different environments.",
    "To see how alike they remained how similar the things were that\nhappened to them.",
    "Two sisters perhaps or two brothers who had hardly spent any of their life together and yet in an\nextraordinary way the same things seemed to happen to them at the same time.",
    "It was allindeed it has\nbeen allextremely interesting.",
    "However that is not your interest in the matter I gather.",
    "No said\nPoirot it is a case I thinkthe part of it that is to say that Im interested inof an accident to a child.",
    "That is so.",
    "It was in Surrey I think.",
    "Yes a very pleasant area that in which people lived.",
    "Not very far\nfrom Camberley I think.",
    "Mrs. Jarrow was a young widow at that time and she had two small children.",
    "Her husband had recently died in an accident.",
    "She was as a result Mentally disturbed asked\nPoirot.",
    "No she was not thought to be so.",
    "She was deeply shocked by her husbands death and had a great\nsense of loss but she was not recovering very satisfactorily in the impression of her own doctor.",
    "He did\nnot quite like the way her convalescence was tending and she did not seem to be getting over her\nbereavement in the way that he would have liked.",
    "It seemed to be causing her rather peculiar reactions.",
    "Anyway he wanted a consultation and my father was asked by him to come and see what he could\n\n\fmake of it.",
    "He found her condition interesting and at the same time he thought it held very decided\ndangers and he seemed to think that it would be as well if she was put under observation in some nursing\nhome where particular care could be taken.",
    "Things like that.",
    "Even more so after the case when this\naccident to the child happened.",
    "There were two children and according to Mrs. Jarrows account of what happened it was the older\nchild a girl who attacked the little boy who was four or five years younger than she was hitting him with\na garden spade or hoe so that he fell into an ornamental pond they had in the garden and was drowned.",
    "Well these things as you know happen quite often among children.",
    "Children are pushed in a\nperambulator into a pond sometimes because an older child being jealous thinks that Mummy will have\nso much less trouble if only Edward or Donald or whatever his name is wasnt here or It would be\nmuch nicer for her.",
    "It all results from jealousy.",
    "There did not seem to be any particular case or evidence of jealousy in this case though.",
    "The child had\nnot resented the birth of her brother.",
    "On the other hand Mrs. Jarrow had not wanted this second child.",
    "Although her husband had been pleased to have this second child coming Mrs. Jarrow did not want it.",
    "She had tried two doctors with the idea of having an abortion but did not succeed in finding one who\nwould perform what was then an illegal operation.",
    "It was said by one of the servants and also by a boy\nwho was bringing a telegram I believe to the house that it was a woman who attacked the boy not the\nother child.",
    "And one of the servants said very definitely she had been looking out of the window and that\nit was her mistress.",
    "She said I dont think the poor thing knows what she is doing nowadays.",
    "You\nknow just since the master died shes been in oh such a state as never was.",
    "Well as I say I dont\nknow exactly what you want to know about the case.",
    "A verdict was brought in of accident.",
    "It was\nconsidered to be an accident and the children had been said to be playing together pushing each other\net cetera and that therefore it was undoubtedly a very unfortunate accident.",
    "It was left at that but my\nfather when consulted and after a conversation with Mrs. Jarrow and certain tests questionnaires\nsympathetic remarks to her and questions he was quite sure she had been responsible for what\nhappened.",
    "According to his advice it would be advisable for her to have mental treatment.",
    "But your\nfather was quite sure that she had been responsible\nYes.",
    "There was a school of treatment at the time which was very popular and which my father believed\nin.",
    "That schools belief was that after sufficient treatment lasting sometimes quite a long time a year or\nlonger people could resume a normal everyday life and it was to their advantage to do so.",
    "They could\nbe returned to live at home and with a suitable amount of attention both medical and from those usually\nnear relatives who were with them and could observe them living a normal life everything would go well.",
    "This I may say did meet with success at first in many cases but later there was a difference.",
    "Several\ncases had most unfortunate results.",
    "Patients who appeared to be cured came home to their natural\nsurroundings to a family a husband their mothers and fathers and slowly relapsed so that very often\ntragedies or neartragedies occurred.",
    "One case my father was bitterly disappointed inalso a very\nimportant case in his knowledge was a woman who came back to live with the same friend she lived\nwith before.",
    "All seemed to be going happily but after about five or six months she sent urgently for a\ndoctor and when he camesaid I must take you upstairs because you will be angry at what I have done\nand you will have to send for the police I am afraid.",
    "I know that must happen.",
    "But you see I was\ncommanded to do this I saw the Devil looking out of Hildas eyes.",
    "I saw the Devil there so I knew what\nI had to do.",
    "I knew I had to kill her.",
    "The woman was lying dead in a chair strangled and after her death her eyes\nhad been attacked.",
    "The killer died in a mental home with never any feeling about her crime except that it had been a\nnecessary command laid upon her because it was her duty to destroy the Devil.",
    "Poirot shook his head\n\n\fsadly.",
    "The doctor went on Yes.",
    "Well I consider that in a mild way Dorothea PrestonGrey suffered\nfrom a form of mental disorder that was dangerous and that she could only be considered safe if she lived\nunder supervision.",
    "This was not generally accepted I may say at the time and my father did consider it\nmost inadvisable.",
    "After she had been committed once more to a very pleasant nursing home a very good\ntreatment was given.",
    "And again after a period of years she appeared to be completely sane left the\nestablishment lived an ordinary life with a very pleasant nurse more or less in charge of her though\nconsidered in the household as a ladys maid.",
    "She went about made friends and sooner or later went\nabroad.",
    "To India said Poirot.",
    "Yes.",
    "I see youve been correctly informed.",
    "She went to India to stay with her twin sister.",
    "And there\nanother tragedy happened Yes.",
    "A child of a neighbor was attacked.",
    "It was thought at first by an ayah\nand afterwards I believe one of the native servants a bearer was suspected.",
    "But there again there\nseemed no doubt that Mrs. Jarrow had for one of those mental reasons known only to her been guilty\nof the attack.",
    "There was no definite evidence I understand which could be brought against her.",
    "I think\nGeneralI forget his name now Ravenscroft said Poirot.",
    "Yes yes General Ravenscroft agreed to arrange for her to go back to England and again undergo\nmedical treatment.",
    "Is that what you wanted to know Yes said Poirot that is what I have partly\nheard already but mainly I may say by hearsay which is not dependable.",
    "What I want to ask you was this was a case concerned with identical twins.",
    "What about the other twin\nMargaret PrestonGrey.",
    "Afterwards the wife of General Ravenscroft.",
    "Was she likely to be affected by the same malady There\nwas never any medical case about her.",
    "She was perfectly sane.",
    "My father was interested visited her\nonce or twice and talked to her because he had so often seen cases of almost identical illnesses or mental\ndisturbances happen between identical twins who had started life very devoted to each other.",
    "Only\nstarted life you said Yes.",
    "On certain occasions a state of animosity can arise between identical twins.",
    "It follows on a first keen protective love one for the other but it can degenerate into something which is\nnearer hatred if there is some emotional strain that could trigger it off or could arouse it or any emotional\ncrisis to account for animosity arising between two sisters.",
    "I think there might have been that here.",
    "General Ravenscroft as a young subaltern or captain or whatever\nhe was fell deeply in love I think with Dorothea PrestonGrey who was a very beautiful girl.",
    "Actually\nthe more beautiful of the two.",
    "She also fell in love with him.",
    "They were not officially engaged but Captain Ravenscroft transferred his\naffections fairly soon to the other sister Margaretor Molly as she was called.",
    "He fell in love with her\nand asked her to marry him.",
    "She returned his affection and they were married as soon as it became\nfeasible in his career.",
    "My father had no doubt that the other twin Dolly was bitterly jealous of her sisters\nmarriage and that she continued to be in love with Alistair Ravenscroft and to resent his marriage.",
    "However she got over it all married another man in due coursea thoroughly happy marriage it\nseemed and later she used frequently to go to visit the Ravenscrofts not only on that one occasion in\nMalaya but later when they were in another station abroad and after they returned home.",
    "She was by\nthat time apparently cured again was no longer in any kind of mental dejection and lived with a very\nreliable nursecompanion and staff of servants.",
    "I believe or so my father had always told me that Lady\nRavenscroft Molly remained very devoted to her sister.",
    "She felt very protective towards her and loved\nher dearly.",
    "She wanted often I think to see more of her than she did but General Ravenscroft was not\nso keen on her doing so.",
    "I think it possible that the slightly unbalanced DollyMrs.",
    "Jarrow continued to\nfeel a very strong attachment to General Ravenscroft which I think may have been embarrassing and\ndifficult for him though I believe that his wife was quite convinced that her sister had got over any feelings\n\n\fof jealousy or anger.",
    "I understand Mrs. Jarrow was staying with the Ravenscrofts about three weeks or\nso before the tragedy of their suicide happened.",
    "Yes that was quite true.",
    "Her own tragic death\nhappened then.",
    "She was quite frequently a sleepwalker.",
    "She went out one night walking in her sleep and\nhad an accident falling down a portion of the cliff to which a pathway which had been discarded\nappeared to lead.",
    "She was found the next day and I believe died in hospital without recovering\nconsciousness.",
    "Her sister Molly was extremely upset and bitterly unhappy about this but I would like to say which you\nprobably want to know I do not think that this can in any way be held responsible for the subsequent\nsuicide of the married couple who were living so happily together.",
    "Grief for a sisters or a sisterinlaws\ndeath would hardly lead you to commit suicide.",
    "Certainly not to a double suicide Unless perhaps said Hercule Poirot Margaret Ravenscroft had\nbeen responsible for her sisters death.",
    "Good heavens said Dr. Willoughby surely you are not\nsuggesting\u2014 That it was Margaret who followed her sleepwalking sister and that it was Margarets\nhand that was stretched out to push Dorothea over the cliff edge I refuse absolutely said Dr.\nWilloughby to accept any such idea.",
    "With people said Hercule Poirot one never knows.",
    "CHAPTER XV Eugene And Rosentelle Hair Stylists And Beauticians\nMrs. Oliver looked at Cheltenham with approval.",
    "As it happened she had never been to Cheltenham\nbefore.",
    "How nice said Mrs. Oliver to herself to see some houses that are really like houses proper\nhouses.",
    "Casting her mind back to youthful days she remembered that she had known people or at least her\nrelations her aunts had known people who lived at Cheltenham.",
    "Retired people usually.",
    "Army or Navy.",
    "It was the sort of place she thought where one would like to come and live if one had spent a good deal\nof time abroad.",
    "It had a feeling of English security good taste and pleasant chat and conversation.",
    "After looking in one or two agreeable antique shops she found her way to where she wantedor rather\nHercule Poirot wanted herto go.",
    "It was called The Rose Green Hairdressing Saloons.",
    "She walked\ninside it and looked round.",
    "Four or five people were in process of having things done to their hair.",
    "A\nplump young lady left her client and came forward with an inquiring air.",
    "Mrs. Rosentelle said Mrs. Oliver glancing down at a card.",
    "I understand she said she could see me if\nI came here this morning.",
    "I dont mean she added having anything done to my hair but I wanted to\nconsult her about something and I believe a telephone call was made and she said if I came at halfpast\neleven she could spare me a short time.",
    "Oh yes said the girl.",
    "I think Madam is expecting someone.",
    "She led the way through a passage down a short flight of steps and pushed a swing door at the bottom of\nit.",
    "From the hairdressing saloon they had passed into what was obviously Mrs. Rosentelles house.",
    "The\nplump girl knocked at the door and said The lady to see you as she put her nose in and then asked\nrather nervously What name did you say Mrs. Oliver said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "She walked in.",
    "It had a faint effect of what might have been yet another showroom.",
    "There were curtains\nof rose gauze and roses on the wallpaper and Mrs. Rosentelle a woman Mrs.\nOliver thought of as roughly her own age or possibly a good many years older was just finishing what\nwas obviously a cup of morning coffee.",
    "Mrs. Rosentelle said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Yes You did expect me Oh yes.",
    "I didnt quite understand what it was all about.",
    "The lines are so bad on the telephone.",
    "That is quite all right.",
    "I have about half an hour to spare.",
    "Would\nyou like some coffee No thank you said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I wont keep you any longer than I need.",
    "It is\njust something that I want to ask you about that you may happen to remember.",
    "You have had quite a\nlong career I understand in the hairdressing business.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Im quite thankful to give over to the\ngirls now.",
    "I dont do anything myself these days.",
    "Perhaps you still advise people Yes I do do that.",
    "Mrs. Rosentelle smiled.",
    "She had a nice intelligent face with wellarranged brown hair with somewhat interesting gray streaks in it\nhere and there.",
    "Im not sure what its all about.",
    "Well really I wanted to ask you a question about well I suppose in a\nway about wigs generally.",
    "We dont do as much in wigs now as we used to do.",
    "You had a business in\nLondon didnt you Yes.",
    "First in Bond Street and then we moved to Sloane Street but its very nice to\nlive in the country after all that you know.",
    "Oh yes my husband and I are very satisfied here.",
    "We run a small business but we dont do much in the wig line nowadays she said though my husband\ndoes advise and get wigs designed for men who are bald.",
    "It really makes a big difference you know to\nmany people in their business if they dont look too old and it often helps in getting a job.",
    "I can quite\nimagine that said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "From sheer nervousness she said a few more things in the way of ordinary chat and wondered how she\nwould start on her subject.",
    "She was startled when Mrs. Rosentelle leaned forward and said suddenly\nYou are Ariadne Oliver arent you The novel writer Yes said Mrs. Oliver as a matter of fact\nshe had her usual somewhat shamefaced expression when she said this that was habitual to heryes I\ndo write novels.",
    "Im so fond of your books.",
    "Ive read a lot of them.",
    "Oh this is very nice indeed.",
    "Now\ntell me in what way can I help you Well I wanted to talk about wigs and about something that\nhappened a great many years ago and probably you maynt remember anything about it.",
    "Well I rather\nwonderdo you mean fashions of years ago  Not exactly.",
    "Its a woman a friend of mineactually I\nwas at school with herand then she married and went out to India and came back to England and there\nwas a tragedy later and one of the things I think that people found surprising after it was that she had so\nmany wigs.",
    "I think they had been all supplied by you by your firm I mean.",
    "Oh a tragedy.",
    "What was\nher name Well her name when I knew her was PrestonGrey but afterwards her name was\nRavenscroft.",
    "Oh.",
    "Oh yes that one.",
    "Yes I do remember Lady Ravenscroft.",
    "I remember her quite well.",
    "She was so nice and really very very goodlooking still.",
    "Yes her husband\nwas a colonel or a general or something and theyd retired and they lived inI forget the county now\nAnd there was what was supposed to be a double suicide said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I remember reading about it and saying Why thats our Lady Ravenscroft and then there\nwas a picture of them both in the paper and I saw that it was so.",
    "Of course Id never seen him but it\nwas her all right.",
    "It seemed so sad so much grief.",
    "I heard that they discovered that she had cancer and\nthey couldnt do anything about it so this happened.",
    "But I never heard any details or anything.",
    "No said\nMrs. Oliver.",
    "But what is it you think I can tell you You supplied her with wigs and I understand the people\ninvestigating I suppose the police thought four wigs was quite a lot to have but perhaps people did have\nfour wigs at a time Well I think that most people had two wigs at least said Mrs. Rosentelle.",
    "You\nknow one to send back to be serviced as you might say and the other one that they wore while it was\naway.",
    "Do you remember Lady Ravenscroft ordering an extra two wigs She didnt come herself.",
    "I\n\n\fthink shed been or was ill in hospital or something and it was a French young lady who came.",

    "Im afraid they gave her\nbad news at the hospital or wherever she was and so she just couldnt face living any more and her\nhusband felt he couldnt face life without her\u2014 Mrs. Oliver shook her head sadly and continued her\ninquiries.",
    "They were different kinds of wigs I suppose.",
    "Yes one had a very pretty gray streak in it and then\nthere was a party one and one for evening wear and one closecropped with curls.",
    "Very nice that you\ncould wear under a hat and it didnt get messed up.",
    "I was sorry not to have seen Lady Ravenscroft again.",
    "Even apart from her illness she had been very unhappy about a sister who had recently died.",

    "Its such fun.",
    "You enjoy life altogether dont you Yes I do.",
    "I suppose its the feeling\nthat one never knows what might be going to happen next.",
    "Yet that feeling said Mrs. Rosentelle is\njust what makes so many people never stop worrying\nCHAPTER XVI Mr. Goby Reports\nMr. Goby came into the room and sat as indicated by Poirot in his usual chair.",
    "He glanced around him\nbefore choosing what particular piece of furniture or part of the room he was about to address.",
    "He\nsettled as often before for the electric fire not turned on at this time of year.",
    "Mr. Goby had never been\nknown to address the human being he was working for directly.",
    "He selected always the cornice a\nradiator a television set a clock sometimes a carpet or a mat.",
    "Out of a briefcase he took a few papers.",
    "Well said Hercule Poirot you have something for me I have collected various details said Mr.\nGoby.",
    "Mr. Goby was celebrated all over London indeed possibly all over England and even further as a great\npurveyor of information.",
    "How he performed these miracles nobody ever really quite knew.",
    "He employed\na not excessive staff.",
    "Sometimes he complained that his legs as he sometimes called them were not as\ngood as they used to be.",
    "But his results were still able to astonish people who had commissioned them.",
    "Mrs. BurtonCox he said announcing the name much as though he had been the local churchwarden\nhaving his turn at reading the lessons.",
    "He might equally have been saying Third verse fourth chapter the\nbook of Isaiah.",
    "Mrs. BurtonCox he said again.",
    "Married Mr. Cecil Aidbury manufacturer of buttons\non a large scale.",
    "Rich man.",
    "Entered politics was MP for Little Stansmere.",
    "Mr. Cecil Aldbury was killed in a car accident four years\n\n\fafter their marriage.",
    "The only child of the marriage died in an accident shortly afterwards Mr. Aldburys\nestate was inherited by his wife but was not as much as had been expected since the firm had not been\ndoing well of late years.",
    "Mr. Aldbury also left quite a considerable sum of money to a Miss Kathleen\nFenn with whom it seemed he had been having intimate relations quite unknown to his wife.",
    "Mrs.\nBurtonCox continued her political career.",
    "Some three years after that she adopted a child which had\nbeen born to Miss Kathleen Fenn.",
    "Miss Kathleen Fenn insisted that the child was the son of the late Mr.\nAldbury.",
    "This from what I have been able to learn in my inquiries is somewhat difficult to accept\ncontinued Mr.\nGoby.",
    "Miss Fenn had had many relationships usually with gentlemen of ample means and generous\ndispositions but after all so many people have their price have they not Im afraid this is quite a serious\nbill I may have to send you in.",
    "Continue said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Mrs. Aldbury as she then was agreed to adopt the child.",
    "A short while later she married Major BurtonCox.",
    "Miss Kathleen Fenn became I may say a most\nsuccessful actress and pop singer and made a very large amount of money.",
    "She then wrote to Mrs.\nBurtonCox saying she would be willing to take back the adopted child.",
    "Mrs. BurtonCox refused.",
    "Mrs. BurtonCox has been living quite comfortably since I understand.",
    "Major BurtonCox was killed in\nMalaya.",
    "He left her moderately well off.",
    "A further piece of information I have obtained is that Miss\nKathleen Fenn who died a very short while agoeighteen months I thinkleft a will by which her entire\nfortune which amounted by then to a considerable sum of money was left to her natural son Desmond\nat present known under the name of Desmond BurtonCox.",
    "Very generous said Poirot.",
    "Of what did\nMiss Fenn die My informant tells me that she contracted leukemia.",
    "And the boy has inherited his\nmothers money It was left in trust for him to acquire at the age of twentyfive.",
    "So he will be\nindependent will have a substantial fortune\nAnd Mrs BurtonCox Has not been happy in her investments it is understood.",
    "She has sufficient to live on but not much more.",
    "Has the boy Desmond made a will asked Poirot.",
    "That said Mr. Goby I fear I do not know as yet.",
    "But I have certain means of finding out.",
    "If I do I will\nacquaint you with the fact without loss of time.",
    "Mr. Goby took his leave absentmindedly bowing a\nfarewell to the electric fire.",
    "About an hour and a half later the telephone rang.",
    "Hercule Poirot with a sheet of paper in front of him was making notes.",
    "Now and then he frowned\ntwirled his moustaches crossed something out and rewrote it and then proceeded onward.",
    "When the\ntelephone rang he picked up the receiver and listened.",
    "Thank you he said that was quick work.",
    "Yes... yes Im grateful.",
    "I really do not know sometimes how\nyou manage these things...",
    "Yes that sets out the position clearly.",
    "It makes sense of something that did not\nmake sense before..",
    "Yes...",
    "I gather... yes Im listening... you are pretty sure that that is the case.",
    "He knows he is adopted...\nbut he never has been told who his real mother was... yes.",
    "Yes I see...",
    "Very well.",
    "You will clear up the other point too Thank you.",
    "He replaced the receiver and started once\n\n\fmore writing down words.",
    "In half an hour the telephone rang once more.",
    "Once again he picked up the phone.",
    "Im back from Cheltenham said a voice which Poirot bad no difficulty in recognizing.",
    "Ah chore madame you have returned You have seen Mrs.\nRosentelle Yes.",
    "She is nice.",
    "Very nice.",
    "And you were quite right you know.",
    "She is another elephant.",
    "Meaning chere madame I mean that she remembered Molly Ravenscroft.",
    "And she remembered\nher wigs Yes.",
    "Briefly she outlined what the retired hairdresser had told her about the wigs.",
    "Yes said Poirot that agrees.",
    "That is exactly what Superintendent Garroway mentioned to me.",
    "The\nfour wigs that the police found.",
    "Curls an evening type of headdress and two other plainer ones.",
    "Four.",
    "So I really only told you what you knew already No you told me something more than that.",
    "She\nsaidthat is what you told me just now is it notthat Lady Ravenscroft wanted two extra wigs to add\nto the two that she already had and that this was about three weeks to six weeks before the suicide\ntragedy occurred.",
    "Yes that is interesting is it not Its very natural said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "I mean you\nknow that people women I mean may do awful damage to things.",
    "To false hair and things of that kind.",
    "If it cant be redressed and cleaned if its got burnt or got stuff spilt\non it you cant get out or its been dyed and dyed all wrongsomething like thatwell then of course\nyou have to get two new wigs or switches or whatever they are.",
    "I dont see what makes you excited\nabout that.",
    "Not exactly excited said Poirot no.",
    "It is a point but the more interesting point is what you\nhave just added.",
    "It was a French lady was it not who brought the wigs to be copied or matched Yes.",
    "I gathered some kind of companion or something.",
    "Lady Ravenscroft had been or was in hospital or in a nursing home somewhere and she was not in good\nhealth and she could not come herself to make a choice or anything of that kind.",
    "I see.",
    "And so her\nFrench companion came.",
    "Do you know the name of that companion by any chance No.",
    "I dont\nthink Mrs. Rosentelle mentioned it.",
    "In fact I dont think she knew.",
    "The appointment was made by Lady\nRavenscroft and the French girl or woman just brought the wigs along for size and matching and all the\nrest of it I suppose.",
    "Well said Poirot that helps me towards the further step that I am about to take.",
    "What have you learned said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Have you done anything You are always so skeptical\nsaid Poirot.",
    "You always consider that I do nothing that I sit in a chair and repose myself.",
    "Well I think\nyou sit in a chair and think admitted Mrs.\nOliver but I quite agree that you dont often go out and do things.",
    "In the near future I think I may\npossibly go out and do things said Hercule Poirot and that will please you.",
    "I may even cross the\nChannel though certainly not in a boat.",
    "A plane I think is indicated.",
    "Oh said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "Do you\nwant me to come too No said Poirot I think it would be better if I went alone on this occasion.",
    "You really will go Oh yes oh yes.",
    "I will run about with all activity and so you should be pleased with\nme madame.",
    "When he had rung off he dialed another number which he looked up from a note he had\nmade in his pocketbook.",
    "Presently he was connected to the person whom he wished to speak to.",
    "My dear Superintendent Garroway it is Hercule Poirot who addresses you.",
    "I do not derange you too\nmuch You are not very busy at this moment No I am not busy said Superintendent Garroway.",
    "I\nam pruning my roses thats all.",
    "There is something that I want to ask you.",
    "Quite a small thing.",
    "About\nour problem of the double suicide Yes about our problem.",
    "You said there was a dog in the house.",
    "You said that the dog went for walks with the family or so you understood.",
    "Yes there was some\nmention made of a dog.",
    "I think it may have been either the housekeeper or someone who said that they\n\n\fwent for a walk with the dog as usual that day.",
    "In examination of the body was there any sign that\nLady Ravenscroft had been bitten by a dog Not necessarily very recently or on that particular day\nWell its odd you should say that.",
    "I cant say Id have remembered about it if you hadnt mentioned such\na thing.",
    "But yes there were a couple of scars.",
    "Not bad ones.",
    "But again the housekeeper mentioned that the dog\nhad attacked its mistress more than once and bitten her though not very severely.",
    "Look here Poirot\nthere was no rabies about if thats what you are thinking.",
    "There couldnt have been anything of that kind.",
    "After all she was shotthey were both shot.",
    "There was no question of any septic poisoning or danger of\ntetanus.",
    "I do not blame the dog said Poirot it was only something I wanted to know.",
    "One dog bite\nwas fairly recent about a week before I think or two weeks somebody said.",
    "There was no case of\nnecessary injections or anything of that kind.",
    "It had healed quite well.",
    "Whats that quotation went on\nSuperintendent Garroway.",
    "The dog it was that died.",
    "I cant remember where it comes from but\nAnyway it wasnt the dog that died said Poirot.",
    "That wasnt the point of my question.",
    "I would like to\nhave known that dog.",
    "He was perhaps a very intelligent dog.",
    "After he had replaced the receiver with\nthanks to the Superintendent Poirot murmured An intelligent dog.",
    "More intelligent perhaps than the\npolice were.",
    "CHAPTER XVII Poirot Announces Departure\nMiss Livingstone showed in a guest.",
    "Mr. Hercules Poirot.",
    "As soon as Miss Livingstone had left the\nroom Poirot shut the door after her and sat down by his friend Mrs. Ariadne Oliver.",
    "He said lowering his voice slightly I depart.",
    "You do what said Mrs. Oliver who was always slightly\nstartled by Poirots methods of passing on information.",
    "I depart.",
    "I make the departure.",
    "I take a plane to Geneva.",
    "You sound as though you were UNO or\nUNESCO or something.",
    "No.",
    "It is just a private visit that I make.",
    "Have you got an elephant in\nGeneva Well I suppose you might look at it that way.",
    "Perhaps two of them.",
    "I havent found out\nanything more said Mrs. Oliver.",
    "In fact I dont know who I can go to to find out any more.",
    "I believe\nyou mentioned or somebody did that your goddaughter Celia Ravenscroft had a young brother.",
    "Yes\nHes called Edward I think.",
    "Ive hardly ever seen him.",
    "I took him out once or twice from school I\nremember.",
    "But that was years ago.",
    "Where is he now Hes at university in Canada I think.",
    "Or hes taking some\nengineering course there.",
    "Do you want to go and ask him things No not at the moment.",
    "I should just\nlike to know where he is now.",
    "But I gather he was not in the house whpen this suicide happened i\nYoure not thinkingyoure not thinking for a moment that fee did it are you I mean shot his father and\nhis mother both of them.",
    "I know boys do sometimes.",
    "Very queer they are sometimes when theyre at a\nfunny age.",
    "He was not in the house said Poirot.",
    "That I know already from my police reports.",
    "Have\nyou found out anything else interesting You look quite excited.",
    "I am excited in a way.",
    "I have found out\ncertain things that may throw light upon what we already know.",
    "Well what throws light on what It\nseems to me possible now that I can understand why Mrs. BurtonCox approached you as she did and\ntried to get you to obtain information for her about the facts of the suicide of the Ravenscrofts.",
    "You\nmean she wasnt just being a noseyparker No.",
    "I think there was some motive behind it.",
    "This is where\nperhaps money comes in.",
    "Money Whats money got to do with that Shes quite well off isnt she\nShe has enough to live upon yes.",
    "But it seems that her adopted son whom she regards apparently as\nher true sonhe knows that he was adopted although he knows nothing about the family from which he\nreally came.",
    "It seems that when he came of age he made a will possibly urged by his adopted mother to\ndo so.",
    "Perhaps it was merely hinted to him by some friends of hers or possibly by some lawyer that she\nhad consulted.",
    "Arayway on coming of age he may have felt that he might as welU leave everything to\n\n\fher to his adopted mother.",
    "Presumably sat that time he had nobody else to leave it to.",
    "I dont sees how that leads to wanting news\nabout a suicide.",
    "Dont youu She wanted to discourage the marriage.",
    "If young Desmond had a girl\nfriend if he proposed to marry her in the near tfuture which is what a lot of young people do\nnowadays\u2014tAey cant wait or think it over.",
    "In that case Mrs.\nBurtonCox would not inherit the money he left since the marriage woruld invalidate any earlier will and\npresumably if he did marry this girl he would make a new will leaving everything too her and not to his\nadopted mother And you mean Mrs. BurtonCox didnt want that She wantlted to find something\nthat would discourage him from marryii ng the girl.",
    "I think she hoped and probably really believed as far\nas that goes that Celias mother killed her husband aftterwards shooting herself.",
    "That is the sort of thing\nthat might discourage a boy.",
    "Even if her father killed her mother it iss still a discouraging thought.",
    "It might\nquite easily prejudice amd influence a boy at that age.",
    "You mearn hed think if her father or mother was\na murderer the girl might have murderous tendencies Not quitte as crude as that but that might be the\nmain idea I shouuld think.",
    "But he wasnt rich was he An adopted child.",
    "He didnat know his real\nmothers name or who she was but it seem s that his mother who was an actress and a singer and who\nmaanaged to make a great deal of money before she became ill and died wanted at one time to get her\nchild returned too her and when Mrs. BurtonCox would not agree to that I sl hould imagine she\nthought about this boy a great deal and daecided that she would leave her money to him.",
    "He will inheriWt\nthis money at the age of twentyfive but it is held in trust for him until then.",
    "So of course Mrs.\nBurtonCox doesnt warnt him to marry or only to marry someone that she really apprroves of or over\nwhom she might have influence.",
    "Yes that seems to me fairly reasonable.",
    "Shes not a nice woman\nthough is she No said Poirot I did not think her a very nice woman.",
    "And thats why she didnt\nwant you coming to see her and messing about with things and finding out what she was up to.",
    "Possibly said Poirot.",
    "Anything else you have learned Yes I have learned\u2014that is only a few hours ago really\u2014 when\nSuperintendent Garroway happened to ring me up about some other small matters but I did ask him and\nhe told me that the housekeeper who was elderly had very bad eyesight.",
    "Does that come into it\nanywhere It might said Poirot.",
    "He looked at his watch.",
    "I think he said it is time that I left.",
    "You\nare on your way to catch your plane at the airport No.",
    "My plane does not leave until tomorrow\nmorning.",
    "But there is a place I have to visit today\u2014a place that I wish to see with my own eyes.",
    "I have a\ncar waiting outside now to take me there\u2014 What is it you want to see Mrs. Oliver asked with some\ncuriosity.",
    "Not so much to see\u2014to feel.",
    "Yes that is the right word\u2014to feel and to recognize what it will be that I\nfeel...\nCHAPTER XVIII Interlude\nHercule Poirot passed through the gate of the churchyard.",
    "He walked up one of the paths and presently against a mossgrown wall he stopped looking down on a\ngrave.",

    "Then his eyes came back again.",
    "Flowers had been put recently on the grave.",
    "A small bunch of\nassorted wild flowers the kind of bunch that might have been left by a child but Poirot did not think that\nit was a child who had left them.",

    "Here is someone thought Hercule Poirot very remarkable.",
    "I am Hercule Poirot mademoiselle.",
    "I know.",
    "I was expecting you either today or tomorrow.",
    "Ah.",

    "It is no doubt still in the post.",
    "Our posts are a little uncertain.",
    "No I had\na letter from someone else.",
    "From Celia Ravenscroft No.",
    "It was a letter written by someone in close\ntouch with Celia.",
    "A boy or a young man whichever we like to regard him as called Desmond\nBurtonCox.",
    "He prepared me for your arrival.",
    "Ah.",
    "I see.",
    "He is intelligent and he wastes no time I think.",
    "He was very urgent that I should come and see you.",
    "So I gathered.",
    "Theres trouble I understand.",
    "Trouble that he wants to resolve and so does Celia.",
    "They think you can help them Yes and they think\nthat you can help me.",
    "They are in love with each other and wish to marry.",
    "Yes but there are\ndifficulties being put in their way.",
    "Ah by Desmonds mother I presume.",

    "There are circumstances or have been circumstances in Celias life that have prejudiced his mother\nagainst his early marriage to this particular girl.",
    "Ah.",
    "Because of the tragedy for it was a tragedy.",
    "Yes\nbecause of the tragedy.",
    "Celia has a godmother who was asked by Desmonds mother to try and find out\nfrom Celia the exact circumstances under which that suicide occurred.",
    "Theres no sense in that said\nMademoiselle Meauhourat.",
    "She motioned with her hand.",
    "Sit down.",
    "Please sit down.",
    "I expect we shall have to talk for some little\ntime.",
    "Yes Celia could not tell her godmother\u2014Mrs.",
    "Ariadne Oliver the novelist is it not Yes I\nremember.",
    "Celia could not give her the information because she has not got the information herself.",
    "She\nwas not there when the tragedy occurred and no one told her anything about it.",
    "Is that right Yes that\nis right.",
    "It was thought inadvisable.",
    "Ah.",
    "And do you approve of that decision or disapprove of it It is\ndifficult to be sure.",
    "Very difficult.",
    "Ive not been sure of it in the years that have passed since then and\nthere are quite a lot.",
    "Celia as far as I know has never been worried.",
    "Worried I mean as to the why and wherefore.",
    "Shes accepted it as she would have accepted an airplane\naccident or a car accident.",
    "Something that resulted in the death of her parents.",
    "She spent many years in a pensionnat abroad.",
    "Actually I think the pensionnat was run by you.",
    "Mademoiselle Meauhourat.",
    "That is quite true.",
    "I have retired recently.",
    "A colleague of mine is now taking\nit on.",
    "But Celia was sent out to me and I was asked to find for her a good place for her to continue her\neducation as many girls do come to Switzerland for that purpose.",
    "I could have recommended several\nplaces.",
    "At the moment I took her into my own.",
    "And Celia asked you nothing did not demand\ninformation No.",
    "It was you see before the tragedy happened.",
    "Oh.",
    "I did not quite understand that.",
    "Celia came out here some weeks before the tragic occurrence.",
    "I was at that time not here myself.",
    "I was still with General and Lady Ravenscroft.",
    "I looked after Lady\nRavenscroft acting as a companion to her rather than as a governess to Celia who was still at that\nmoment in boardingschool.",
    "But it was suddenly arranged that Celia should come to Switzerland and\nfinish her education there.",
    "Lady Ravenscroft had been in poor health had she not Yes.",
    "Nothing very\nserious.",
    "Nothing as serious as she had herself feared at one time.",
    "But she had suffered a lot of nervous\nstrain and shock and general worry.",
    "You remained with her A sister whom I had living in Lausanne\nreceived Celia on her arrival and settled her into the institution which was only for about fifteen or sixteen\ngirls but there she would start her studies and await my return.",
    "I returned some three or four weeks\nlater.",
    "But you were at Overcliffe at the time it happened.",
    "I was at Overcliffe.",
    "General and Lady\nRavenscroft went for a walk as was their habit.",
    "They went out and did not return.",
    "They were found\n\n\fdead shot.",
    "The weapon was found lying by them.",
    "It was one that belonged to General Ravenscroft and\nhad been always kept in a drawer in his study.",
    "The fingermarks of both of them were found on that\nweapon.",
    "There was no definite indication of who had held it last.",
    "Impressions of both people slightly smeared were on it.",
    "The obvious solution was a double suicide.",
    "You found no reason to doubt that The police found no reason so I believe.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "I beg your pardon said Mademoiselle Meauhourat.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Just something upon which I reflect.",
    "Poirot looked at her.",
    "Brown hair as yet hardly\ntouched with gray lips closed firmly together gray eyes a face which showed no emotion.",
    "She was in\ncontrol of herself completely.",
    "So you cannot tell me anything more I fear not.",
    "It was a long time ago.",
    "You remember that time well\nenough.",
    "Yes.",
    "One cannot entirely forget such a sad thing.",
    "And you agreed that Celia should not be\ntold anything more of what had led up to this Have I not just told you that I had no extra information\nYou were there living at Overcliffe for a period of time before the tragedy were you not Four or five\nweeks\u2014six weeks perhaps.",
    "Longer than that really.",
    "Although I had been governess to Celia early I\ncame back this time after she went to school in order to help Lady Ravenscroft.",
    "Lady Ravenscrofts\nsister was living with her also about that time was she not Yes.",
    "She had been in hospital having special\ntreatment for I elephants can remember some time.",
    "She had shown much improvement and the\nauthorities had feltthe medical authorities I speak ofthat she would do better to lead a normal life with\nher own relations and the atmosphere of a home.",
    "As Celia had gone to school it seemed a good time for\nLady Ravenscroft to invite her sister to be with her.",
    "Were they fond of each other those two sisters\nIt was difficult to know said Mademoiselle Meauhourat.",
    "Her brows drew together.",
    "It was as though what Poirot had just said aroused her interest.",
    "I have\nwondered you know.",
    "I have wondered so much since and at the time really.",
    "They were identical twins\nyou know.",
    "They had a bond between them a bond of mutual dependence and love and in many ways\nthey were very alike.",
    "But there were ways also in which they were not alike.",
    "You mean I should be\nglad to know just what you mean by that.",
    "Oh this has nothing to do with the tragedy.",
    "Nothing of that\nkind.",
    "But there was a definite as I shall put it a definite physical or mental flawwhichever way you like\nto put it.",
    "Some people nowadays hold the theory that there is some physical cause for any kind of mental disorder.",
    "I believe that it is fairly well recognized by the medical profession that identical twins are born either with\na great bond between them a great likeness in their characters which means that although they may be\ndivided in their environment where they are brought up the same things will happen to them at the same\ntime of life.",
    "They will take the same trend.",
    "Some of the cases quoted as medical examples seem quite\nextraordinary.",
    "Two sisters one living in Europe one say in France the other in England they have a dog of the same\nkind which they choose at about the same date.",
    "They marry men singularly alike.",
    "They give birth perhaps\nto a child almost within a month of each other.",
    "It is as though they have to follow the pattern wherever\nthey are and without knowing what the other one is doing.",
    "Then there is the opposite to that.",
    "A kind of\nrevulsion a hatred almost that makes one sister draw apart or one brother reject the other as though\nthey seek to get away from the sameness the likeness the knowledge the things they have in common.",
    "And that can lead to very strange results.",
    "I know said Poirot I have heard of it.",
    "I have seen it once\nor twice.",
    "Love can turn to hate very easily.",
    "It is easier to hate where you have loved than it is to be\n\n\findifferent where you have loved.",
    "Ah you know that said Mademoiselle Meauhourat.",
    "Yes I have seen it not once but several times.",
    "Lady Ravenscrofts sister was very like her I think she\nwas still very like her in appearance though if I may say so the expression on her face was very\ndifferent.",
    "She was in a condition of strain as Lady Ravenscroft was not.",
    "She had a great aversion to\nchildren.",
    "I dont know why.",
    "Perhaps she had had a miscarriage in early life.",
    "Perhaps she had longed for a\nchild and never had one but she had a kind of resentment against children.",
    "A dislike of them.",
    "That had\nled to one or two rather serious happenings had it not said Poirot.",
    "Someone has told you that I have heard things from people who knew both sisters when they were in\nIndia.",
    "Lady Ravenscroft was there with her husband and her sister.",
    "Dolly came out to stay with them\nthere.",
    "There was an accident to a child there and it was thought that Dolly might have been partially\nresponsible for it.",
    "Nothing was proved definitely but I gather that Mollys husband took his sisterinlaw\nhome to England and she had once more to go into a mental home.",
    "Yes I believe that is a very good\naccount of what happened.",
    "I do not of course know it of my own knowledge.",
    "No but there are things you do know I think from\nyour own knowledge.",
    "If so I see no reason for bringing them back to mind now.",
    "Is it not better to leave things when at least they have been accepted There are other things that could\nhave happened that day at Overcliffe.",
    "It may have been a double suicide it couldhave been a murder it\ncould have been several other things.",
    "You were told what had happened but I think from one little\nsentence you just said that you know what happened of your own knowledge.",
    "You know what\nhappened that day and I think you know what happened perhapsor began to happen shall we\nsaysometime before that.",
    "The time when Celia had gone to Switzerland and you were still at\nOvercliffe.",
    "I will ask you one question.",
    "I would like to know what your answer would be to it.",
    "It is not a\nthing of direct information.",
    "It is a question of what you believe.",
    "What were the feelings of General Ravenscroft towards those two\nsisters the twin sisters I know what you mean.",
    "For the first time her manner changed slightly.",
    "She\nwas no longer on her guard.",
    "She leaned forward now and spoke to Poirot almost as though she definitely\nfound a relief in doing so.",
    "They were both beautiful she said as girls.",
    "I heard that from many people.",
    "General Ravenscroft fell in\nlove with Dolly the mentally afflicted sister.",
    "Although she had a disturbed personality she was\nexceedingly attractivesexually attractive.",
    "He loved her very dearly and then I dont know whether he\ndiscovered in her some characteristic something perhaps that alarmed him or in which he found a\nrepulsion of some kind.",
    "He saw perhaps the beginning of insanity in her the dangers connected with her.",
    "His affections went to her sister.",
    "He fell in love with the sister and married her.",
    "He loved them both you\nmean.",
    "Not at the same time but in each case there was genuine fact of love.",
    "Oh yes he was devoted\nto Molly relied on her and she on him.",
    "He was a very lovable man.",
    "Forgive me said Poirot.",
    "You\ntoo were in love with him I think.",
    "Youyou dare say that to me Yes.",
    "I dare say it to you.",
    "I am not\nsuggesting that you and he had a love affair.",
    "Nothing of that kind.",
    "Im only saying that you loved him.",
    "Yes said Zeiie Meauhourat.",
    "I loved him.",
    "In a sense I still love him.",
    "Theres nothing to be ashamed of.",
    "He trusted me and relied on me but he was never in love with me.",
    "You can love and serve and still be\nhappy.",
    "I wanted no more than I had.",
    "Trust sympathy belief in me And you did said Poirot what\nyou could to help him in a terrible crisis in his life.",
    "There are things you do not wish to tell me.",
    "There are\nthings that I will say to you things that I have gathered from various information that has come to me that\nI know something about.",
    "Before I have come to see you I have heard from others from people who\nhave known not only Lady Ravenscroft not only Molly but who have known Dolly And I know\nsomething of Dolly the tragedy of her life the sorrow the unhappiness and also the hatred the streak\n\n\fperhaps of evil the love of destruction that can be handed down in families.",
    "If she loved the man she was\nengaged to she must have when he married her sister felt hatred perhaps towards that sister.",
    "Perhaps\nshe never quite forgave her.",
    "But what of Molly Ravenscroft Did she dislike her sister\nDid she hate her Oh no said Zeiie Meauhourat she loved her sister.",
    "She loved her with a very deep\nand protective love.",
    "That I do know.",
    "It was she who always asked that her sister should come and make\nher home with her.",
    "She wanted to save her sister from unhappiness from danger too because her sister\nwould often relapse into fits of rather dangerous rages.",
    "She was frightened sometimes.",
    "Well you know\nenough.",
    "You have already said that there was a strange dislike of children from which Dolly suffered.",
    "You mean that she disliked Celia No no not Celia.",
    "The other one.",
    "Edward.",
    "The younger one.",
    "Twice\nEdward had dangers of an accident.",
    "Once some kind of tinkering with a car and once some outburst of\nviolent annoyance.",
    "I know Molly was glad when Edward went back to school.",
    "He was very young\nremember\u2014much younger than Celia.",
    "He was only eight or nine at preparatory school.",
    "He was\nvulnerable.",
    "Molly was frightened about him.",
    "Yes said Poirot I can understand that.",
    "Now if I may I\nwill talk of wigs.",
    "Wigs the wearing of wigs.",
    "Four wigs.",
    "That is a lot for one woman to possess at one\ntime.",
    "I know what they were like what they looked like.",
    "I know that when more were needed a French\nlady went to the shop in London and spoke about them and ordered them.",
    "There was a dog too.",
    "A dog\nwho went for a walk on the day of the tragedy with General Ravenscroft and his wife.",
    "Earlier that dog\nsome little time earlier had bitten his mistress Molly Ravenscroft.",
    "Dogs are like that said Zeiie\nMeauhourat.",
    "They are never quite to be trusted.",
    "Yes I know that.",
    "And I will tell you what I think\nhappened on that day and what happened before that.",
    "Some little time before that.",
    "And if I will not\nlisten to you You will listen to me.",
    "You may say that what I have imagined is false.",
    "Yes you might\neven do that but I do not think you will.",
    "I am telling you and I believe it with all my heart that what is\nneeded here is the truth.",
    "It is not just imagining it is not just wondering.",
    "There is a girl and a boy who\ncare for each other and who are frightened of the future because of what may have happened and what\nthere might be handed down from the father or the mother to the child.",
    "I am thinking of the girl Celia.",
    "A\nrebellious girl spirited difficult perhaps to manage but with brains a good mind capable of happiness\ncapable of courage but needing\u2014there are people who need\u2014truth.",
    "Because they can face truth\nwithout dismay.",
    "They can face it with that brave acceptance that you have to have in life if life is to be any good to you.",
    "And the boy that she loves he wants that for her too.",
    "Will you listen to me Yes said Zeiie\nMeauhourat I am listening.",
    "You understand a great deal I think and I think you know more than I\ncould have imagined you would know.",
    "Speak and I will listen.",

    "Hercule Poirot turned away from the sea and back along the narrow path that led to a house once called\nOvercliffe.",
    "It was not very far.",
    "He saw cars parked against a wall.",
    "He saw the outline of a house against the sky.",
    "A\nhouse that was clearly empty that needed repainting.",
    "A house agents board hung there announcing that\nthis desirable property was for sale.",
    "On the gate the word Overcliffe had a line drawn over it and the\nname Down House replaced it.",
    "He went to meet two people who were walking towards him.",
    "One was\nDesmond BurtonCox and the other was Celia Ravenscroft.",
    "I got an order from the house agent said Desmond saying we wanted to view it or however they put\nit.",
    "Ive got the key in case we want to go inside.",
    "Its changed hands twice in the last five years.",
    "But there\nwouldnt be anything to see there now would there I shouldnt think so said Celia.",
    "After all its\nbelonged to lots of people already.",
    "Some people called Archer who first bought it and then somebody\ncalled Fallowfield I think.",
    "They said it was too lonely.",
    "And now these last people are selling it too.",
    "Perhaps they were haunted.",
    "Do you really believe in haunted houses said Desmond.",
    "Well now of course I dont think so really said Celia but this might be mightnt it I mean the sort of\nthings that happened the sort of place it is and everything...",
    "I do not think so said Poirot.",
    "There was\nsorrow here and death but there was also love.",
    "A taxi came along the road.",
    "I expect thats Mrs. Oliver said Celia.",
    "She said shed come by train and take a taxi from the station.",
    "Two women got out of the taxi.",
    "One was Mrs. Oliver and with her was a tall elegantly dressed woman.",
    "Since Poirot knew she was coming he was not taken by surprise.",

    "Oh Celia sprang forward.",
    "She went towards the woman and her face had lit up.",
    "Zeiie she said.",
    "It is Zeiie It is really Zeiie Oh I am so pleased.",
    "I didnt know you were coming.",
    "Monsieur Hercule Poirot asked me to come.",

    "I wanted you to come too because you put this in hand didnt you You got Monsieur Poirot and you\nfound out some things yourself didnt you People told me things said Mrs. Oliver people whom I\nthought might remember things.",
    "Some of them did remember things.",
    "Some of them remembered them\nright and some of them remembered them wrong.",
    "That was confusing.",
    "Monsieur Poirot says that that\ndoes not really matter.",
    "No said Poirot it is just as important to know what is hearsay and what is\ncertain knowledge.",
    "Because from one you can learn facts even if they are not quite the right facts or had\n\n\fnot got the explanation that you think they had.",
    "With the knowledge that you got for me madame from\nthe people whom you designated elephants He smiled a little.",
    "Elephants said Mademoiselle Zeiie.",

    "I turned a lot of the things I\nheard over to Monsieur Poirot and hehe has made a sort ofoh if he was a doctor I should call it a\nsort of diagnosis I suppose.",
    "I made a list said Poirot.",
    "A list of things that seemed to be pointers to\nthe truth of what happened all those years ago.",
    "I shall read the various items to you to see perhaps if you who were concerned in all this feel that they\nhave any significance.",
    "You may not see their significance or you may see it plainly.",
    "One wants to know said Celia.",
    "Was it\nsuicide or was it murder Did somebody\u2014some outside person\u2014kill both my father and my mother\nshoot them for some reason we dont know about some motive.",
    "I shall always think there was something\nof that kind or something else.",
    "Its difficult but\u2014 We will stay here I think said Poirot.",
    "We will not\ngo into the house as yet.",
    "Other people have lived in it and it has a different atmosphere.",
    "We will perhaps\ngo in if we wish when we have finished our court of inquiry here.",
    "Its a court of inquiry is it said\nDesmond.",
    "Yes.",
    "A court of inquiry into what happened.",
    "He moved towards some iron seats which stood near the\nshelter of a large magnolia near the house.",

    "Suicide or murder.",
    "One of them must be true said Celia.",
    "I shall say to you that both are true and more than those two.",
    "According to my ideas we have here not\nonly a murder and also a suicide but we have as well what I shall call an execution and we have a\ntragedy also.",
    "A tragedy of two people who loved each other and who died for love.",
    "A tragedy of love\nmay not always belong to Romeo and Juliet.",

    "No.",
    "There is more to it than that.",
    "I dont understand said Celia.",
    "Not yet.",
    "Shall I understand said Celia.",
    "I think so said Poirot.",
    "I will tell you what I think happened and I will tell you how I came to think so.",
    "The first things that struck me were the things that were not explained by the evidence that the police\nexamined.",
    "Some things were very commonplace were not evidence at all youd think.",
    "Among the possessions of the dead Margaret Ravenscroft were four wigs.",
    "He repeated with emphasis\nFour wigs.",
    "He looked at Zeiie.",
    "She did not use a wig all the time said Zeiie.",
    "Only occasionally.",
    "If she traveled or if shed been out and\ngot very disheveled and wanted to tidy herself in a hurry or sometimes shed use one that was suitable\nfor evening wear.",
    "Yes said Poirot it was quite the fashion at that particular date.",
    "People certainly\nwhen they traveled abroad usually had a wig or two wigs.",
    "But in her possession were four wigs.",
    "Four wigs seemed to me rather a lot.",
    "I wondered why she needed four.",
    "According to the police whom I\nasked it was not that she had any tendency to baldness.",
    "She had the ordinary hair a woman of her age\nwould have and in good condition.",
    "All the same I wondered about those.",
    "One of the wigs had a gray streak in it I learned later.",
    "It was her\nhairdresser who told me that.",
    "And one of the wigs had little curls.",
    "It was the latter wig she was wearing\nthe day she died.",
    "Is that significant in any way asked Celia.",
    "She might have been wearing any of\nthem.",
    "She might.",
    "I also learned the housekeeper told the police that she had been wearing that\nparticular wig almost all the time for the last few weeks before she died.",
    "It appeared to be her favorite\none.",
    "I cant see There was also a saying that Superintendent Garroway quoted to me Same\nmandifferent hat.",
    "It gave me furiously to think.",
    "Celia repeated I dont see Poirot said There was\nalso the evidence of the dog The dogwhat did the dog do The dog bit her.",
    "The dog was said to\nbe devoted to its mistress but in the last few weeks of her life the dog turned on her more than once and\nbit her quite severely.",
    "Do you mean it knew she was going to commit suicide Desmond stared.",
    "No something much simpler than that\u2014 I dont\u2014 Poirot went on\u2014No it knew what no one else\nseemed to know.",
    "It knew she was not its mistress.",
    "She looked like its mistress.",
    "The housekeeper who\nwas slightly blind and also deaf saw a woman who wore Molly Ravenscrofts clothes and the most\nrecognizable of Molly Ravenscrofts wigs\u2014the one with little curls all over the head.",

    "Same wig\u2014different woman.",
    "The dog knew\u2014he knew by what his nose told him.",
    "A different woman\nnot the woman he loved\u2014a woman whom he disliked and feared.",
    "And I thought suppose that woman\nwas not Molly Ravenscroft\u2014but who could she be Could she be Dolly\u2014the twin sister But thats\nimpossible said Celia.",
    "No it was not impossible.",
    "After all remember they were twins.",
    "I must come now to the things that\nwere brought to my notice by Mrs. Oliver.",
    "The things people told her or suggested to her.",
    "The\nknowledge that Lady Ravenscroft had recently been in hospital or in a nursing home and that she perhaps\nhad known that she suffered from cancer or thought that she did.",
    "Medical evidence was against that\nhowever.",
    "She still might have thought she did but it was not the case.",
    "Then I learned little by little the\nearly history of her and her twin sister who loved each other very devotedly as twins do did everything\nalike wore clothes alike the same things seemed to happen to them they had illnesses at the same time\nthey married about the same time or not very far removed in time.",
    "And eventually as many twins do instead of wanting to do everything in the same fashion and the same\nway they wanted to do the opposite.",
    "To be as unlike each other as they could.",
    "And even between them grew a certain amount of dislike.",
    "More than that.",
    "There was a reason in the past for that.",
    "Alistair Ravenscroft as a young man fell in love with Dorothea PrestonGrey the elder twin of the two.",
    "But his affection shifted to the other sister Margaret whom he married.",
    "There was jealousy then no doubt which led to an estrangement between the sisters.",
    "Margaret\ncontinued to be deeply attached to her twin but Dorothea no longer was devoted in any way to\nMargaret.",
    "That seemed to me to be the explanation of a great many things.",
    "Dorothea was a tragic figure.",
    "By no fault of her own but by some accident of genes of birth of hereditary characteristics she was\nalways mentally unstable.",
    "At quite an early age she had for some reason which has never been made clear a dislike of children.",
    "There is every reason to believe that a child came to its death through her action.",
    "The evidence was not\ndefinite but it was definite enough for a doctor to advise that she should have mental treatment and she\nwas for some years treated in a mental home.",
    "When reported cured by doctors she resumed normal life\ncame often to stay with her sister and went out to India at a time when they were stationed out there to\njoin them there.",
    "And there again an accident happened.",
    "A child of a neighbor.",
    "And again although perhaps there was no very definite proof it seems again Dorothea might have been\nresponsible for it.",
    "General Ravenscroft took her home to England and she was placed once more in medical care.",
    "Once\nagain she appeared to be cured and after psychiatric care it was again said that she could go once more\nand resume a normal life.",
    "Margaret believed this time that all would be well and thought that she ought to\nlive with them so that they could watch closely for any signs of any further mental disability.",
    "I dont think\nthat General Ravenscroft approved.",
    "I think he had a very strong belief that just as someone can be born\ndeformed spastic or crippled in some way she had a deformity of the brain which would recur from time\nto time and that she would have to be constantly watched and saved from herself in case some other\ntragedy happened.",
    "Are you saying asked Desmond that it was she who shot both the Ravenscrofts\nNo said Poirot that is not my solution.",
    "I think what happened was that Dorothea killed her sister\nMargaret.",
    "They walked together on the cliff one day and Dorothea pushed Margaret over.",
    "The dormant\nobsession of hatred and resentment of the sister who though so like herself was sane and healthy was\ntoo much for her.",
    "Hate jealousy the desire to kill all rose to the surface and dominated her.",
    "I think that\nthere was one outsider who knew who was here at the time that this happened.",
    "I think you knew.",
    "Mademoiselle Zeiie.",
    "Yes said Zeiie Meauhourat I knew.",
    "I was here at the time.",
    "The Ravenscrofts\nhad been worried about her.",
    "That is when they saw her attempt to injure their small son Edward.",
    "Edward was sent back to school and I and Celia went to my pensionnat.",
    "I came back hereafter seeing\nCelia settled in.",
    "Once the house was empty except for myself General Ravenscroft and Dorothea and Margaret nobody\nhad any anxiety.",
    "And then one day it happened.",
    "The two sisters went out together.",
    "Dolly returned alone.",
    "She seemed in a very queer and nervous state.",
    "She came in and sat down at the tea table.",
    "It was then\nGeneral Ravenscroft noticed that her right hand was covered with blood.",
    "He asked her if she had had a\nfall.",
    "She said Oh no it was nothing.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "I got scratched by a rosebush.",
    "But there were no\nrosebushes on the Downs.",
    "It was a purely foolish remark and we were worried.",
    "If she had said a gorse bush we might have accepted the remark.",
    "General Ravenscroft went out and I\nwent after him.",
    "He kept saying as he walked Something has happened to Margaret.",
    "Im sure something has happened\nto Molly.",
    "We found her on a ledge a little way down the cliff.",
    "She had been battered with a rock and\nstones.",
    "She was not dead but she had bled heavily.",
    "For a moment we hardly knew what we could do.",
    "We dared not move her.",
    "We must get a doctor we felt at once but before we could do that she clung\nto her husband.",
    "She said gasping for breath Yes it was Dolly.",
    "She didnt know what she was doing.",
    "She didnt know Alistair.",
    "You mustnt let her suffer for it.",
    "Shes never known the things she does or why.",
    "She cant help it.",
    "Shes\nnever been able to help it.",
    "You must promise me Alistair.",
    "I think Im dying now.",
    "Nono we wont have\ntime to get a doctor and a doctor couldnt do anything.",
    "Ive been lying here bleeding to deathand Im\nvery close to death.",
    "I know that but promise me.",
    "Promise me youll save her.",
    "Promise me you wont let\nthe police arrest her.",
    "Promise me that shell not be tried for killing me not shut up for life as a criminal.",
    "Hide me somewhere so that my body wont be found.",
    "Please please its the last thing I ask you.",
    "You\nwhom I love more than anything in the world.",
    "If I could live for you I would but Im not going to live.",
    "I\ncan feel that.",
    "I crawled a little way but that was all I could do.",
    "Promise me.",
    "And you Zeiie you love me\ntoo.",
    "I know.",
    "Youve loved me and been good to me and looked after me always.",
    "And you loved the\nchildren so you must save Dolly.",
    "You must save poor Dolly.",
    "Please please.",
    "For all the love we have for\neach other Dolly must be saved.",
    "And then said Poirot what did you do It seems to me that you\nmust in some way between you Yes.",
    "She died you know.",
    "She died within about ten minutes of those\nlast words and I helped him.",
    "I helped him to hide her body.",
    "It was a place a little farther along the cliff.",
    "We carried her there and there were rocks and boulders and stones and we covered her body as best\nwe could.",
    "There was no path to it really or no way.",
    "You had to scramble.",
    "We put her there.",
    "All Alistair\nsaid again and again wasI promised her.",
    "I must keep my word.",
    "I dont know how to do it.",
    "I dont\nknow how anyone can save her.",
    "I dont know.",
    "But Well we did do it.",
    "Dolly was in the house.",
    "She\nwas frightened desperate with fright but at the same time she showed a horrible kind of satisfaction.",
    "She\nsaid I always knew.",
    "Ive known for years that Molly was really evil.",
    "She took you away from me\nAlistair.",
    "You belonged to mebut she took you away from me and made you marry her and I always\nknew one day I should get even with her.",
    "I always knew.",
    "Now Im frightened.",
    "Whatll they do to\nme\u2014whatll they say I cant be shut up again.",
    "I cant I cant.",
    "I shall go mad.",
    "You wont let me be shut\nup.",
    "Theyll take me away and theyll say Im guilty of murder.",
    "It wasnt murder.",
    "I just had to do it.",
    "Sometimes\nI do have to do things.",
    "I wanted to see the blood you know.",
    "I couldnt wait to see Molly die though.",
    "I\nran away.",
    "But I knew she would die.",
    "I just hoped you wouldnt find her.",
    "She just fell over the cliff.",
    "People would say it was an accident.",
    "Its a horrible story said Desmond.",
    "Yes said Celia its a horrible story but its better to know.",
    "Its better to know isnt it I cant even feel\nsorry for her.",
    "I mean for my mother.",
    "I know she was sweet.",
    "I know there was never any trace of evil in\nher\u2014she was good all through\u2014and I know I can understand why my father didnt want to marry\nDolly.",
    "He wanted to marry my mother because he loved her and he had found out by then that there was\nsomething wrong with Dolly.",
    "Something bad and twisted.",
    "But how\u2014how did you do it all We told a\ngood many lies said Zeiie.",
    "We hoped the body would not be found so that later perhaps it might be\nremoved in the night or something like that to somewhere where it could look as though shed fallen down\ninto the sea.",
    "But then we thought of the sleepwalking story.",
    "What we had to do was really quite simple.",
    "Alistair said Its frightening you know.",
    "But I promised\u2014I swore to Molly when she was dying.",
    "I swore Id do as she asked.",
    "Theres a way a\npossible way to save Dolly if only Dolly can do her part.",
    "I dont know if shes capable of it.",
    "I said Do\nwhat And Alistair said Pretend shes Molly and that its Dorothea who walked in her sleep and fell to\nher death.",
    "We managed it.",
    "Took Dolly to an empty cottage we knew of and I stayed with her there for\nsome days.",
    "Alistair said Molly had been taken to hospital suffering from shock after the discovery that\nher sister had fallen over the cliff while walking in her sleep at night.",
    "Then we brought Dolly back\u2014\nbrought her back as Molly\u2014wearing Mollys clothes and Mollys wig.",
    "I got extra wigs\u2014the kind with\ncurls which really did disguise her.",
    "The dear old housekeeper Janet couldnt see very well.",
    "Dolly and\nMolly were really very much alike you know and their voices were alike.",
    "Everyone accepted quite\neasily that it was Molly behaving rather peculiarly now and then because of still suffering from shock.",
    "It\nall seemed quite natural.",
    "That was the horrible part of it\u2014 But how could she keep it up asked Celia.",
    "It must have been dreadfully difficult.",
    "No\u2014she did not find it difficult.",
    "She had got you see what she\nwanted\u2014what she had always wanted.",
    "She had got Alistair\u2014 But Alistair\u2014how could he bear it\nHe told me why and how\u2014on the day he had arranged for me to go back to Switzerland.",
    "He told me\nwhat I had to do and then he told me what he was going to do.",
    "He said There is only one thing for me to do.",
    "I promised Margaret that I wouldnt hand Dolly over to\nthe police that it should never be known that she was a murderess that the children were never to know\nthat they had a murderess for an aunt.",
    "No one need ever know that Dolly committed murder.",
    "She walked in her sleep and fell over the cliff\u2014a sad accident and she will be buried here in the church\nand under her own name.",
    "How can you let that be done I asked.",
    "I couldnt bear it.",
    "He said Because of what I am going to do\u2014you have got to know about it.",
    "You see he said Dolly\nhas to be stopped from living.",
    "If shes near children shell take more lives\u2014poor soul shes not fit to live.",
    "But you must understand Zeiie that because of what I am going to do I must pay with my own life too.",
    "I shall live here quietly for a few weeks with Dolly playing the part of my wife\u2014and then there will be\nanother tragedy\u2014 I didnt understand what he meant.",
    "I said Another accident Sleepwalking again\nAnd he said No\u2014what will be known to the world is that I and Molly have both committed suicide.",
    "I\ndont suppose the reason will ever be known.",
    "They may think its because she was convinced she had canceror that I thought soall sorts of things\nmay be suggested.",
    "But you seeyou must help me Zeiie.",
    "You are the only person who really loves me\nand loves Molly and loves the children.",
    "If Dolly has got to die I am the only person who must do it.",
    "She\nwont be unhappy or frightened.",
    "I shall shoot her and then myself.",
    "Her fingerprints will show on the\nrevolver because she handled it not long ago and mine will be there too.",
    "Justice has to be done and I\nhave to be the executioner.",
    "The thing I want you to know is that I didthat I still dolove them both.",
    "Molly more than my life.",
    "Dolly because I pity her so much for what she was born to be.",
    "He said\nAlways remember that  Zeiie rose and came towards Celia.",
    "Now you know the truth she said.",
    "I\npromised your father that you should never know.",
    "I have broken my word.",
    "I never meant to reveal it to you or to anyone else.",
    "Monsieur Poirot made me\nfeel differently.",
    "But its such a horrible story I understand how you felt said Celia.",
    "Perhaps you\nwere right from your point of view but II am glad to know because now a great burden seems to have\nbeen lifted off me Because now said Desmond we both know.",
    "And its something well never mind\nabout knowing.",
    "It was a tragedy.",
    "As Monsieur Poirot here has said it was a real tragedy of two people who loved each other.",
    "But they\ndidnt kill each other because they loved each other.",
    "One was murdered and the other executed a\nmurderer for the sake of humanity so that more children shouldnt suffer.",
    "One can forgive him if he was\nwrong but I dont think it was wrong really.",
    "She was a frightening woman always said Celia.",
    "Even\nwhen I was a child I was frightened of her but I didnt know why.",
    "But I do know why now.",
    "I think my\nfather was a brave man to do what he did.",
    "He did what my mother asked him to do begged him to do\nwith her dying breath.",
    "He saved her twin sister whom I think shed always loved very dearly.",
    "I like to\nthinkoh it seems a silly thing for me to say she looked doubtfully at Hercule Poirot.",
    "Perhaps you\nwont think so.",
    "I expect youre a Catholic but its whats written on their tombstone.",
    "In death they were\nnot divided.",
    "It doesnt mean that they died together but I think they are together.",
    "I think they came\ntogether afterwards.",
    "Two people who loved each other very much and my poor aunt whom Ill try to\nfeel more kindly about than I ever didmy poor aunt didnt have to suffer for what she couldnt perhaps\nhelp herself doing.",
    "Mind you said Celia suddenly breaking into her ordinary everyday voice she\nwasnt a nice person.",
    "You cant help not liking people if theyre not nice people.",
    "Perhaps she could have\nbeen different if she tried but perhaps she couldnt.",
    "And if so one has to think of her as someone who\nwas very illlike somebody for instance who had plague in a village and they wouldnt let her go out or\nfeed her and she couldnt go among other people because the whole village would have died.",
    "Something\nlike that.",
    "But Ill try and be sorry for her.",
    "And my mother and fatherI dont worry about them any more.",
    "They loved each other so much and loved poor unhappy hating Dolly.",
    "I think Celia said Desmond\n\n\fwed better get married now as soon as possible.",
    "I can tell you one thing.",
    "My mother is never going to\nhear anything about this.",
    "Shes not my own mother and shes not a person I can trust with this sort of\nsecret.",
    "Your adopted mother Desmond said Poirot I have good reason to believe was anxious to\ncome between you and Celia and tried to influence you in the idea that from her mother and father she\nmight have inherited some terrible characteristic.",
    "But you know or you may not know and I see no\nreason why I should not tell you you will inherit from the woman who was your real mother and who\ndied not very long ago leaving all her money to you.",
    "You will inherit a very large sum when you reach the\nage of twentyfive.",
    "If I marry Celia of course we shall need the money to live on said Desmond.",
    "I\nquite understand I know my fcresent adopted mother is very keen on money and I often lend her money\neven now.",
    "She suggested my seeing a lawyer th other day because she said it was very dangerous now\nthat I was over twentyone not leaving a will behind me.",
    "I suppse she thought shed get the money.",
    "I\nhad thought of probably leaving nearly all the money to her.",
    "But of course now Celia and I are getting\nmarried I shall leave it to Celiaand I didnt like the way my mother tried to put me against Celia.",
    "I\nthink your suspicions are entirely correct said Poirot.",
    "I dare say she could tell herself that she meant it all for the best that Celias origin is something that you\nought t know if there is a risk for you to take but All right said Desmond butI know Im being\nUnkind.",
    "After all she adopted me and brought me up and all the rest of it and I dare say if theres enough money\nI can settle some of it on her.",
    "Celia and I will have the rest and were going to be happy together.",
    "After\nall there are things thatll make us feel sad from time to time but we shant worry any more shall we\nCelia No said Celia well never worry again.",
    "I think they were rather splendid people my mother\nand father.",
    "Mother tried to look after her sister all her life but I suppose if was a bit too hopeless.",
    "You\ncant stop people from being like they are.",
    "Ah dear children said Zeiie.",
    "Forgive me for calling you\nchildren because you are not.",
    "You are a grown man and Vyoman.",
    "I know that.",
    "I am so pleased to have seen you again and to know I have not done any harm in what I\ndid.",
    "You havent done any harm at all and its lovely seeing you dear Zeiie.",
    "Celia went to her and\nhugged her.",
    "Ive always been terribly fond of you she said.",
    "And I was very fond of you too when I knew you said Desmond.",
    "When I lived next door.",
    "You had\nlovely games you played with us.",
    "The two young people turned.",
    "Thank you Mrs. Oliver said Desmond.",
    "Youve been very kind and youve put in a lot of work.",
    "I can\nsee that.",
    "Thank you Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Yes thank you said Celia.",
    "Im very grateful.",
    "They walked away and\nthe others looked after them.",
    "Well said Zeiie I must leave now.",
    "She said to Poirot What about you Will you have to tell anyone\nabout this There is one person I might tell in confidence.",
    "A retired police force officer.",
    "He is no longer\nactively in the Service now.",
    "He is completely retired.",
    "I think he would not feel it is his duty to interfere\nwith what time has now wiped out.",
    "If he was still in active service it might be different.",
    "Its a terrible\nstory said Mrs. Oliver terrible.",
    "And all those people I talked toyes I can see now they all\nremembered something.",
    "Something that was useful in showing us what the truth was although it was\ndifficult to put together.",
    "Except for Monsieur Poirot who can always put things together out of the most extraordinary things.",
    "Like wigs and twins.",
    "Poirot walked across to where Zeiie was standing looking out over the view.",
    "You do not blame me he said for coming to you persuading you to do what you have done No.",
    "I\nam glad.",
    "You have been right.",
    "They are very charming those two and they are well suited I think.",
    "They\nwill be happy.",
    "We are standing here where two lovers once lived.",
    "Where two lovers died and I dont blame him for what he did.",
    "It may have been wrong I suppose it was\nwrong but I cant blame him.",
    "I think it was a brave act even if it was a wrong one.",
    "You loved him too\ndid you not said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Yes.",
    "Always.",
    "As soon as I came to the house.",
    "I loved him dearly.",
    "I dont think he knew it.",
    "There was\nnever anything what you call between us.",
    "He trusted me and was fond of me.",
    "I loved them both.",
    "Both he and Margaret.",
    "There is something I would like to ask you.",
    "He loved Dolly\nas well as Molly didnt he Right up to the end.",
    "He loved them both.",
    "And thats why he was willing to\nsave Dolly.",
    "Why Molly wanted him to.",
    "Which did he love the best of those sisters  I wonder.",
    "That is a thing I shall perhaps never know said\nZeiie.",
    "I never didperhaps I never shall.",
    "Poirot looked at her for a moment then turned away.",
    "He\nrejoined Mrs. Oliver.",
    "We will drive back to London.",
    "We must return to everyday life forget tragedies and love affairs.",
    "Elephants can remember said Mrs. Oliver but we are human beings and mercifully human beings can\nforget.",
