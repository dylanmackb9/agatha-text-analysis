    "\fCHAPTER ONE\nMrs Elspeth McGillicuddy hurried along Platform 3 at Paddington Station\nafter the porter who was carrying her suitcase.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy was short and\nthe porter was tall.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy was also carrying a lot of packages after a\nday of Christmas shopping.",
    "So the porter had already turned the corner at the\nend of the platform while she searched her bag for the ticket at the entrance gate.",
    "At that moment a voice sounded above her head The train standing at\nPlatform 3 is the 4.50 for Brackhampton Milchester Waverton Roxeter and\nstations to Chadmouth.",
    "Passengers for Brackhampton and Milchester travel at\nthe back of the train.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy found her ticket and showed it to the man at the gate\nwho said On the right at the back.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy continued up the platform and found her porter waiting\noutside the door of a thirdclass carriage.",
    "Im travelling firstclass said Mrs McGillicuddy.",
    "You didnt say so said the porter.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy had said so but was\ntoo tired to argue.",
    "The porter carried her suitcase to the next coach where Mrs McGillicuddy\nsat down alone and opened her magazine.",
    "Five minutes later whistles blew and\nthe train started.",
    "The magazine slipped from Mrs McGillicuddys hand her head\ndropped sideways and three minutes later she was asleep.",
    "She slept for thirtyfive minutes and awoke feeling much better as she sat looking out of the window\nat the countryside flying past.",
    "It was almost dark now and the train passed\nthrough a station then began to slow down and then it stopped for a short while\nbefore it began to move forward again.",
    "A train passed them going in the opposite direction.",
    "Then another train\ngoing in the same direction passed frighteningly close to them.",
    "For a time the\ntwo trains ran parallel and Mrs McGillicuddy looked from her window into the\nwindows of the other carriages.",
    "Most of the blinds were down but occasionally\nshe could see people in the carriages although many of them were empty.",
    "Suddenly when the two trains seemed to have stopped because they were\nboth moving at the same slow speed a blind flew up and Mrs McGillicuddy\nlooked into the lighted firstclass carriage that was only a short distance away.",
    "Then she gasped and stood up.",
    "Standing with his back to the window was a man.",
    "His hands were round\nthe throat of a woman and he was slowly strangling her.",
    "Her eyes were wide\nopen and her face was purple.",
    "As Mrs McGillicuddy watched the womans body\ncollapsed.",
    "At the same time the other train began to go forward faster and a\nmoment later it had passed Mrs McGillicuddys train and disappeared.",
    "Then the door of her carriage opened and a man said Ticket please.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy turned to him A woman has been strangled in a train\nthat has just passed ours.",
    "I saw it  through there.",
    "She pointed to the window.",
    "You must do something at once\nThe ticket collector coughed.",
    "You dont think that you may have been\nasleep and  er \nI have been asleep but if you think this was a dream youre wrong.",
    "I saw\nit I tell you.",
    "The ticket collector looked at his watch.",
    "We shall be in Brackhampton in\nseven minutes.",
    "I will report what you have told me.",
    "Perhaps you could give me\nyour name and address...\nMrs McGillicuddy gave him the address where she would be staying for\nthe next few days and her home address in Scotland.",
    "The train was slowing down now and running through the bright lights of\na large town.",
    "As it moved towards a crowded platform the usual voice was\nsaying The train now arriving at Platform 1 is the 5.38 for Milchester\nWaverton Roxeter and stations to Chadmouth...",
    "Her mind went back to the scene on the other train.",
    "Awful really awful...\nand if the blind of the carriage had not by chance flown up... then she would not\nhave been a witness to the crime.",
    "Voices shouted whistles blew doors were banged shut.",
    "The 5.38 moved\nslowly out of Brackhampton station.",
    "An hour and five minutes later it stopped at\nMilchester.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy collected her packages and her suitcase and got\nout.",
    "Outside the station a taxi driver came forward Are you Mrs\nMcGillicuddy For St Mary Mead\nIt was a ninemile drive but at last the taxi reached the familiar village\nstreet and finally stopped.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy got out and walked up the brick\n\n\fpath to the door which was opened by a servant.",
    "While the driver put her bags\ninside Mrs McGillicuddy walked straight through the hall to where at the open\nsitting room door stood a fragile old lady.",
    "Elspeth\nJane\nThey kissed and then without a pause Mrs McGillicuddy cried Oh Jane\nIve just seen a murder\n\n\fCHAPTER TWO\nMiss Marple did not look surprised as she said Most upsetting for you\nElspeth.",
    "I think you should tell me about it at once.",
    "That was exactly what Mrs McGillicuddy wanted to do.",
    "So she sat down\nby the fire and told her story while Miss Marple listened.",
    "When she had finished Miss Marple spoke The best thing I think is for\nyou to go upstairs and have a wash. Then we will have dinner  during which we\nwill not discuss this at all.",
    "After dinner we can discuss it from every point of\nview.",
    "So the two ladies had dinner discussing life in St Mary Mead and also\ntheir gardens.",
    "Then they settled themselves by the fire again and Miss Marple\ntook out two beautiful old glasses from a corner cupboard and from another\ncupboard took out a bottle.",
    "No coffee tonight for you Elspeth.",
    "You are already overexcited and no\nwonder so I suggest you have a glass of my homemade wine.",
    "Jane said Mrs McGillicuddy as she took an enjoyable sip you dont\nthink do you that I imagined it\nCertainly not said Miss Marple.",
    "Thank goodness.",
    "Because that ticket collector he thought so.",
    "Very polite\nbut...",
    "I think Elspeth that he behaved quite normally.",
    "It sounds  and indeed is a very strange story.",
    "But I do not doubt at all that you saw what youve told me\nyou saw.",
    "The man had his back to you so you didnt see his face\nNo.",
    "And the woman can you describe her Young old\nBetween thirty and thirtyfive I think.",
    "Good looking\nI dont know.",
    "Her face you see was all...\nMiss Marple said quickly Yes yes I understand.",
    "How was she dressed\nShe had on a palecoloured fur coat.",
    "No hat.",
    "Her hair was blonde.",
    "And there was nothing particular that you can remember about the man\n\n\fMrs McGillicuddy took a little time to think before she replied.",
    "He was\ntall  and dark I think.",
    "He had a heavy coat on.",
    "Miss Marple paused.",
    "We shall know more I expect in the morning.",
    "In the morning\nWell it will be in the morning newspapers.",
    "After this man had killed her\nhe would be left with a body.",
    "So he would probably leave the train at the next\nstation  can you remember if the carriage had a corridor\nNo it did not.",
    "Then it was a train that was not going far so it would stop at\nBrackhampton.",
    "He left the train at Brackhampton perhaps after arranging the\nbody in a corner seat.",
    "But of course she will soon be discovered  and the news\nwill almost certainly be in the morning papers.",
    "But it was not in the morning papers.",
    "Miss Marple and Mrs McGillicuddy after making sure of this finished\ntheir breakfast in silence.",
    "Then Mrs McGillicuddy stood up and turned to her\nfriend.",
    "Well\nI think said Miss Marple we should walk down to the police station and\ntalk to Sergeant Cornish.",
    "I know him very well so I think hell listen  and pass\nthe information on to the right department.",
    "Frank Cornish was friendly and respectful.",
    "He listened to Mrs\nMcGillicuddys story and after she had finished he said That sounds very\nstrange.",
    "But Miss Marple believed that her friend was telling the truth and he knew\nall about Miss Marple.",
    "She looked soft and fragile but really she was as sharp\nand as clever as it was possible to be.",
    "He said Of course you may have made a mistake  Im not saying you did\n but a lot of joking goes on  it might not have been serious and the woman\nmight not have been dead.",
    "I know what I saw said Mrs McGillicuddy.",
    "Cornish said You have done everything correctly and you can trust me to\nstart inquiries.",
    "He turned to Miss Marple.",
    "What do you think has happened to\n\n\fthe body\nThere seem to be only two possibilities said Miss Marple.",
    "The most\nlikely one was that the body was left in the train but that seems unlikely now\nfor it would have been found last night.",
    "The only other thing the murderer could\nhave done would be to push the body out of the train on to the track.",
    "So it must\nbe on the track somewhere  though that also seems unlikely.",
    "Yes said Cornish.",
    "The body if there is a body ought to have been\ndiscovered by now or will be very soon.",
    "But that day passed and the next day.",
    "On that evening Miss Marple\nreceived a note from Sergeant Cornish.",
    "Considering the matter about which you spoke to me full inquiries have\nbeen made with no result.",
    "No womans body has been found.",
    "I suggest that your\nfriend may have witnessed a scene just as she described but that it was much\nless serious than she thought.",
    "CHAPTER THREE\nLess serious Nonsense said Mrs McGillicuddy.",
    "It was murder She\nlooked at Miss Marple and Miss Marple looked back at her.",
    "Go on Jane say I\nimagined the whole thing Thats what you think now isnt it\nAnyone can be mistaken Miss Marple said gently.",
    "Although I think that\nyou were probably not mistaken...",
    "But I dont think theres anything more you\ncan do.",
    "Thats a relief in a way said Mrs McGillicuddy as Im going out to\nCeylon after Christmas to stay with my son Roderick and I do not want to put\noff that visit.",
    "So if the police choose to be stupid\nMiss Marple shook her head.",
    "Oh no the police arent stupid.",
    "And that\nmakes it interesting doesnt it\nMrs McGillicuddy looked surprised.",
    "One wants to know said Miss Marple who killed the woman and why\nand what happened to her body.",
    "Thats for the police to find out.",
    "Exactly  and they havent found out.",
    "Which means that the man was very\nclever.",
    "I cant imagine how he got rid of it.",
    "You kill a woman in sudden anger  it\ncant have been planned you would never choose to kill someone just before\narriving at a big station.",
    "So you strangle her  and then what can you do... Miss\nMarple paused.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy said Well I am going to stop thinking about it and\nstart thinking about the trains to London tomorrow.",
    "Would the afternoon be all\nright Im going to my daughter Margarets for tea.",
    "I wonder Elspeth if you would mind taking the 12.15 We could have an\nearly lunch.",
    "And I wonder too if Margaret would mind if you didnt arrive for\ntea  if you arrived about seven perhaps\nMrs McGillicuddy looked at her friend curiously.",
    "Are you planning\nsomething Jane\nI suggest Elspeth that I could travel up to London with you and that we\ncould then travel back to Brackhampton in a train at the same time as you\ntravelled the other day.",
    "You could then return to London and I would come on\nhere as you did.",
    "I of course would pay the fares Miss Marple said firmly.",
    "What do you expect Jane Another murder\nCertainly not.",
    "But I would like to see for myself exactly where the crime\nwas committed.",
    "And so the next day Miss Marple and Mrs McGillicuddy sat in two\nopposite corners of a firstclass carriage speeding out of London on the 4.50\nfrom Paddington.",
    "But on this occasion no train passed close to them going in the\nsame direction.",
    "A few trains flashed past them towards London.",
    "On two\noccasions trains flashed past them going the other way.",
    "Were due in Brackhampton in five minutes said Miss Marple.",
    "A ticket collector appeared in the doorway.",
    "Miss Marple looked at Mrs\nMcGillicuddy who shook her head.",
    "It was not the same ticket collector.",
    "He\nlooked at their tickets and moved on a little unsteadily as the train swung round\na long curve and slowed down as it did so.",
    "There were lights flashing past\noutside buildings an occasional sight of streets and buses.",
    "Well be there in a minute said Mrs McGillicuddy and I cant really see\nthis journey has been any good at all.",
    "But this train is a few minutes late.",
    "Was yours on time on Friday\nI think so.",
    "The train ran slowly into Brackhampton station.",
    "Doors opened and shut\npeople got in and out.",
    "Easy thought Miss Marple for a murderer to leave the\nstation amongst all those people or even to find another carriage and go on in\nthe train to the end of its journey.",
    "But not so easy to make a body disappear into\nthe air.",
    "That body must be somewhere.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy had got out and spoke now through the open window.",
    "Take care of yourself Jane.",
    "And dont lets worry ourselves any more about all\nthis.",
    "Weve done what we could.",
    "Miss Marple nodded.",
    "Goodbye Elspeth.",
    "A\nhappy Christmas to you.",
    "A whistle blew and the train began to move but Miss Marple did not lean\nback as it increased speed.",
    "Instead she sat upright.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy had said\nthat they had both done all that they could do.",
    "It was true of Mrs McGillicuddy\nbut about herself Miss Marple did not feel so sure.",
    "Like a General planning a possible battle Miss Marple thought through the\nfacts for and against further action.",
    "For further action were the following\n\n\f1.",
    "My long experience of life and human nature.",
    "2.",
    "Sir Henry Clithering and his godson now at Scotland Yard who was so\nvery nice in the Little Paddocks case.",
    "3.",
    "My nephew Raymonds second boy David who works for British\nRailways.",
    "4.",
    "Griseldas boy Leonard who knows so much about maps.",
    "But I cant go here there and everywhere making inquiries and finding\nout things.",
    "Im too old for any more adventures she thought watching out of the\nwindow the curving line of an embankment...\nA curve...",
    "Very faintly something came into her mind... Just after the ticket collector\nhad seen their tickets...",
    "It suggested an idea.",
    "A completely different idea...",
    "Suddenly Miss Marple did not feel old at all\nThe next morning Miss Marple wrote to her greatnephew David West\nasking for important information.",
    "Fortunately she was invited as usual to the vicarage where Griselda and\nher family lived for Christmas dinner and here she was able to ask young\nLeonard about maps.",
    "Leonard loved maps of all kinds and did not wonder why Miss Marple was\ninterested in a largescale map of a particular area.",
    "He even found one amongst\nhis collection and lent it to her.",
    "Soon Miss Marple received a letter from David West.",
    "It said\nDear Aunt Jane\nIve got the information you wanted.",
    "There is only one train that it can be the 4.33 which is a slow train and stops at Haling Broadway Barwell Heath\nBrackhampton and then stations to Market Basing.",
    "So do I smell some village scandal Did you returning from Christmas\nshopping in London by the 4.50 see the vicars wife being kissed by the Tax\nInspector But why does it matter which train it was\nYours ever\nDavid\n\n\fMiss Marple smiled.",
    "It seemed that some more travelling was necessary.",
    "She went up to London as before on the 12.15 but this time returned not\nby the 4.50 but by the 4.33 in an empty first class carriage.",
    "As the train came\nnear to Brackhampton running around a curve Miss Marple pulled down the\nblind and then stood with her back to the window.",
    "Yes she decided the sudden curving of the line did throw one back against\nthe window and the blind might very easily fly up.",
    "She looked out of the\nwindow.",
    "It was only just dark but to see things clearly she must make a daylight\njourney.",
    "The next day she went up to London by the early morning train.",
    "Then a\nquarter of an hour before she reached Brackhampton Miss Marple got out the\nmap which Leonard had lent her.",
    "She could see exactly where she was just as the\ntrain began to slow down for a curve.",
    "It was a very big curve and Miss Marple\ndivided her attention between watching the ground beneath her and looking at\nthe map until the train finally ran into Brackhampton.",
    "That night she wrote a letter to Miss Florence Hill at 4 Madison Road\nBrackhampton.",
    "And the next morning she went to the library to read about the\nlocal history of the area.",
    "Her idea of what had happened was possible but there\nwas nothing to prove it yet.",
    "And that would need action the kind of action she\nwas not strong enough to take.",
    "If her theory were to be definitely proved or\ndisproved she must have help.",
    "The question was  who Miss Marple thought\nfor a long time.",
    "Then suddenly she smiled and said aloud a name.",
    "Of course Lucy Eyelesbarrow\n\n\fCHAPTER FOUR\nLucy Eyelesbarrow was thirtytwo.",
    "She had taken a First in Mathematics at\nOxford and was expected to have a successful academic life.",
    "But Lucy\nEyelesbarrow as well as being very clever was also very sensible.",
    "She knew\nthat scholars were not wellpaid and she liked money.",
    "And to make money she\nknew that one must do work that is highlyvalued because there are always too\nfew people to do it.",
    "So to the great surprise of her friends and fellow scholars\nLucy Eyelesbarrow decided to become a highlyskilled professional at\nhousework.",
    "Her success was immediate.",
    "Now after about ten years she was known all\nover Britain.",
    "It was quite usual for wives to say joyfully to husbands It will be\nall right.",
    "I can go with you to America.",
    "Ive got Lucy Eyelesbarrow Because\nonce she came into a house all the worry and hard work went out of it.",
    "Lucy\nEyelesbarrow did everything.",
    "She looked after old people and young children\ngot on well with servants and was wonderful with dogs.",
    "She also cooked\nperfectly.",
    "Best of all she never minded what she did.",
    "She washed the kitchen\nfloor dug the garden and carried coal\nOne of her rules was never to accept any job for a long time two weeks or\nfour at the most.",
    "Lucy read the letter from Miss Marple.",
    "She had met her two years ago\nwhen Raymond West the novelist had paid for her to look after his old aunt\nwho had been ill. Lucy had liked Miss Marple very much and now the old lady\nwas asking if she could do a certain job for her  rather an unusual one.",
    "Perhaps\nMiss Eyelesbarrow could meet her so they could discuss it.",
    "So the next day they met alone in a small dark writing room of Lucy\nEyelesbarrows club in London.",
    "She said Im rather busy at the moment but\nperhaps you can tell me what it is you want me to do\nIts very simple really said Miss Marple.",
    "Unusual but simple.",
    "I want you\nto find a body.",
    "What kind of a body asked Lucy Eyelesbarrow with admirable calm.",
    "The body of a woman said Miss Marple who was strangled in a train.",
    "Well thats certainly unusual.",
    "Tell me about it.",
    "Miss Marple told her.",
    "Lucy Eyelesbarrow listened without interrupting.",
    "At\nthe end she said Well what do you want me to do\n\n\fIve got a theory said Miss Marple.",
    "The bodys got to be somewhere.",
    "If it\nwasnt found in the train then it must have been pushed out of the train  but it\nhasnt been found anywhere on the line.",
    "So I travelled down the same way to see\nif there was a place where the body could have been thrown off the train and yet\nnot on to the line  and there was.",
    "The railway line makes a big curve before\ngetting into Brackhampton on the edge of a high embankment.",
    "If a body was\nthrown out there when the train was leaning to one side I think it would fall\nright down the embankment.",
    "But surely it would still be found  even there\nOh yes.",
    "It would have to be taken away... Heres the place  on this map.",
    "Lucy studied the place where Miss Marples finger pointed.",
    "It is right on the edge of Brackhampton now said Miss Marple but\noriginally it was a country house with large grounds and its still there\nuntouched  surrounded by housing estates.",
    "Its called Rutherford Hall.",
    "It was\nbuilt by a man called Crackenthorpe a very rich manufacturer in 1884.",
    "The\noriginal Crackenthorpes son an elderly man is living there still with I hear a\ndaughter.",
    "The railway encircles half of the property.",
    "And you want me to do  what\nI want you to get a job there.",
    "But it might you know be dangerous.",
    "I dont know said Lucy I dont think danger would worry me.",
    "I didnt think it would said Miss Marple.",
    "What do I look for exactly\nAny signs along the embankment a piece of clothing broken bushes  that\nkind of thing.",
    "And then Lucy asked.",
    "I shall be staying nearby said Miss Marple.",
    "With an old servant of mine\nFlorence who lives in Brackhampton.",
    "I think you should mention you have an\naunt living in the neighbourhood and that you want a job that is close to her and\nalso that you need some spare time so that you can go and see her.",
    "I was going on holiday the day after tomorrow Lucy said.",
    "That can wait.",
    "But I can only stay three weeks.",
    "After that I have another job.",
    "If we cant find out anything in three weeks we might as well give up the\n\n\fwhole thing said Miss Marple.",
    "After Miss Marple had gone Lucy rang up an Employment Office in\nBrackhampton and explained she needed a job in the neighbourhood to be near\nher aunt.",
    "After saying no to several more desirable places Rutherford Hall was\nmentioned.",
    "That sounds exactly what I want said Lucy.",
    "Two days later driving her own small car Lucy Eyelesbarrow passed\nbetween two large iron gates.",
    "A long drive wound between dark bushes up to\nRutherford Hall which was like a small castle.",
    "But the stone steps in front of the\ndoor were broken and the drive was green with weeds.",
    "She pulled an old bell and an untidy woman opened the door.",
    "Miss\nEyelesbarrow\nThats right said Lucy.",
    "The house was very cold inside.",
    "The woman led her along a dark hall and\nopened a door.",
    "To Lucys surprise it was a rather pleasant sitting room with\nbooks and pretty chairs.",
    "Ill tell Miss Crackenthorpe youre here said the woman and went away\nshutting the door.",
    "After a few minutes the door opened again.",
    "Emma Crackenthorpe was a\nmiddleaged woman neither good looking nor plain sensibly dressed in warm\nclothes with dark hair and light brown eyes.",
    "Miss Eyelesbarrow She held out her hand.",
    "Then she looked doubtful.",
    "She had clearly been expecting someone very different from Lucy.",
    "I wonder if\nthis job is really right for you I dont want someone just to organize things I\nwant someone to do the work.",
    "Lucy said You want cooking and washingup and housework.",
    "Thats\nwhat I do.",
    "Its a big house you know and we only live in part of it  my father and\nmyself.",
    "I have several brothers but they are not here very often.",
    "Two women\ncome in a Mrs Kidder in the morning and Mrs Hart three days a week.",
    "She\npaused.",
    "My father is old and a little  difficult sometimes.",
    "I wouldnt like\nLucy said quickly Im very used to old people and I always manage to get\non well with them.",
    "Emma Crackenthorpe looked thankful.",
    "Lucy was given a large dark\nbedroom with a small electric heater and was shown round the house.",
    "As they\npassed a door in the hall a voice shouted Is that you Emma Have you got the\nnew girl there Bring her in.",
    "I want to look at her.",
    "The two women entered the room.",
    "Old Mr Crackenthorpe was stretched\nout in a chair.",
    "He was a big but thin man with thick grey hair a large chin and\nsmall lively eyes.",
    "Lets have a look at you young lady.",
    "Lucy advanced confident and smiling.",
    "Theres one thing you must understand straight away.",
    "Just because we live\nin a big house doesnt mean were rich.",
    "Were not rich.",
    "We live simply  do you\nhear  simply I live here because my father built the house and I like it.",
    "Your home is your castle said Lucy.",
    "Youre laughing at me\nOf course not.",
    "I think its very exciting to have a real country place all\nsurrounded by a town.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Fields with cows in them  right in the middle of Brackhampton.",
    "Lucy and Emma left the room and Lucy asked the times of meals and\ninspected the kitchen.",
    "Then she said cheerfully Just leave everything to me.",
    "Lucy got up at six the next morning.",
    "She cleaned the house prepared\nvegetables cooked and served breakfast.",
    "With Mrs Kidder she made the beds\nand at eleven oclock they sat down for some tea in the kitchen\nMrs Kidder was a small thin woman.",
    "Miss Emma has to put up with a lot\nfrom her father she said.",
    "Hes so mean.",
    "But shes not weak.",
    "And when the\ngentlemen come down she makes sure theres something good to eat.",
    "The gentlemen\nYes.",
    "It was a big family.",
    "The eldest Mr Edmund he was killed in the war.",
    "Then theres Mr Cedric he lives abroad somewhere.",
    "He paints pictures.",
    "Mr\nHarold works in the City in London  he married a lords daughter.",
    "Then theres\nMr Alfred he seems very nice but hes been in trouble once or twice  and\ntheres Miss Ediths husband Mr Bryan ever so nice he is  she died some years\nago and theres Master Alexander their little boy.",
    "Hes at school but comes here\nfor the holidays.",
    "Lucy listened carefully to all this information.",
    "When Mrs Kidder had gone\n\n\fshe cooked lunch and when she had cleared it away and washed up she was\nready to start exploring.",
    "First she walked round the gardens.",
    "A flower border near the house was\nthe only place that was free of weeds.",
    "The gardener was a very old man who\nwas only pretending to work in the kitchen garden.",
    "Lucy spoke to him\npleasantly.",
    "He lived in a cottage nearby and behind his cottage was a drive that\nled through the park and under a railway arch into a rough path.",
    "Every few minutes a train ran over the arch.",
    "Lucy watched the trains as\nthey slowed down to go round the sharp curve surrounding the Crackenthorpe\nproperty.",
    "She passed under the railway arch and out into the road.",
    "On one side\nwas the railway embankment on the other was a high wall and some factory\nbuildings.",
    "Lucy walked along the path until it came out into a street of small\nhouses.",
    "A woman was walking past and Lucy stopped her.",
    "Excuse me can you tell me if there is a public telephone near here\nTheres one at the Post Office at the corner of the road.",
    "Lucy thanked her\nand walked along until she came to the Post Office.",
    "There was a telephone box\nat one side.",
    "She went into it dialled and asked to speak to Miss Marple.",
    "A womans voice said Shes resting.",
    "And Im not going to wake her Who\nshall I say called\nMiss Eyelesbarrow.",
    "Just tell her that Ive arrived and that Ill let her know\nwhen I have any news.",
    "CHAPTER FIVE\nThe next day in the sitting room after lunch Lucy said to Emma Will it be\nall right if I just practise a few golf shots in the park\nOh yes certainly.",
    "How clever of you to play golf.",
    "Im not much good but its a pleasanter form of exercise than just going\nfor a walk.",
    "Theres nowhere to walk outside this place said Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Nothing but pavements and miserable little box houses.",
    "Theyd like to buy my\nland and build more of them.",
    "But they wont until Im dead.",
    "And Im not going to\ndie to please anybody.",
    "I can tell you that I know what theyre waiting for.",
    "Cedric and Harold and Alfred... Im surprised he hasnt tried to get rid of me\nalready.",
    "And perhaps he did at Christmastime.",
    "That was a very strange stomach\nupset I had.",
    "Dr Quimper asked me a lot of questions about it.",
    "Everyone gets stomach upsets sometimes Father said Emma.",
    "All right all right say that I ate too much Thats what you mean.",
    "And\nwhy did I eat too much Because there was too much food on the table.",
    "And that\nreminds me  you young woman you sent in five potatoes for lunch.",
    "Two\npotatoes are enough for anybody.",
    "So dont send in more than four in future.",
    "The\nextra one was wasted today.",
    "It wasnt wasted Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "I am going to use it in a Spanish\nomelette tonight.",
    "As Lucy went out of the room she heard him say Shes always got an\nanswer She cooks well though  and shes a good looking girl.",
    "Lucy Eyelesbarrow took a golf club out of the set she had brought with\nher and walked out into the park.",
    "She hit the ball a few times until it landed on\nthe railway embankment then went up and began to look about for it.",
    "During the\nafternoon she searched about a third of the embankment.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Then on the next day she did find something.",
    "A rose bush growing about\nhalfway up the bank had been broken.",
    "Caught on it was a small piece of pale\nbrown fur.",
    "Lucy took some scissors out of her pocket and cut it in half.",
    "The half\nshe had cut off she put in an envelope.",
    "As she came down the steep slope she looked carefully at the long grass\nand at the bottom of the embankment just below the broken rose bush she found\n\n\fa powder compact.",
    "She put it in her pocket.",
    "On the following afternoon Lucy got into her car and went to see her\naunt.",
    "Number 4 Madison Road was a small grey house in a small grey street\nbut it had a very clean doorstep.",
    "The door was opened by a tall woman dressed\nin black who took her to Miss Marple who was in the sitting room by the fire.",
    "Well Lucy said.",
    "It looks as though you were right.",
    "She showed Miss\nMarple what she had found and told her how she had found them.",
    "Miss Marple felt the small piece of fur.",
    "Elspeth said the woman was\nwearing a lightcoloured fur coat.",
    "I suppose the compact was in the pocket of the\ncoat and fell out as the body rolled down the slope.",
    "You didnt take all the fur\nNo I left half of it on the bush.",
    "Very good.",
    "The police will want to check it.",
    "You are going to the police  with these things\nWell  not yet...",
    "It would be better I think to find the body first.",
    "But wont that be very difficult I mean the murderer may have taken it\nanywhere.",
    "Not anywhere said Miss Marple.",
    "Because then he might much more\neasily have killed the girl in some remote place and driven the body away from\nthere.",
    "You havent understood...\nLucy interrupted.",
    "Do you mean  that this crime was planned\nI didnt think so at first said Miss Marple.",
    "But isnt it hard to believe that\na man suddenly killed a woman then looked out of the window and saw the train\ngoing round a curve exactly at a place where he could push the body out and\nwhere he could go later and remove it If he had just thrown her out there by\nchance he wouldnt have done anything else and the body would have been\nfound.",
    "I think that he must have known all about Rutherford Hall its\ngeographical position I mean  an island surrounded by railway lines.",
    "It is exactly like that said Lucy.",
    "So if the murderer came to Rutherford Hall that night before anyone\ncould discover the body the next day how would he come\nLucy thought.",
    "Theres a rough path beside a factory wall.",
    "He would\nprobably come that way turn in under the railway arch and along the back drive.",
    "Then he could go to the bottom of the embankment find the body and carry it\nback to the car.",
    "And then continued Miss Marple he took it to some place he had already\nchosen near Rutherford Hall.",
    "The obvious thing I suppose would be to bury it\nsomewhere.",
    "It wouldnt be easy said Lucy.",
    "He couldnt bury it in the park because\nsomeone would notice it.",
    "Then in some farm building\nThat would be simpler...",
    "There are a lot of old buildings that nobody ever\ngoes near.",
    "So the next afternoon Lucy looked around some of the old farm buildings.",
    "Suddenly she heard someone cough and turned to see the gardener looking at\nher.",
    "You should be careful he said.",
    "That floor is not safe.",
    "And you were up\nthose steps just now and they arent safe either.",
    "I was just wondering if this place could be used for growing things Lucy\nsaid cheerfully.",
    "Everything seems to be in ruins.",
    "Thats because the Master wont spend any money.",
    "But the place could make money  if the buildings were mended.",
    "He doesnt want to make money.",
    "He knows what will happen after hes\ndead  the young gentlemen will sell the whole place as fast as they can.",
    "Theyre\ngoing to get a lot of money when he dies.",
    "I suppose hes a very rich man said Lucy.",
    "Crackenthorpes Delights thats what the business was called.",
    "Mr\nCrackenthorpes father started it and made his fortune.",
    "His two sons were\neducated to be gentlemen and they werent interested in their fathers business.",
    "The younger one was killed in a car accident.",
    "The older one went abroad a lot\nwhen he was young and bought a lot of old statues and had them sent home.",
    "They didnt get on well him and his father.",
    "But after his father died the older Mr Crackenthorpe came and lived\nhere\nHim and his family yes in 1928.",
    "Lucy went back to the house and found Emma Crackenthorpe standing in\nthe hall reading a letter.",
    "My nephew Alexander will be here tomorrow  with a\nschool friend.",
    "Alexanders room is the first one at the top of the stairs.",
    "The one\nnext to it will do for his friend James StoddartWest she said.",
    "Yes Miss Crackenthorpe Ill prepare both rooms.",
    "Theyll arrive before lunch.",
    "Emma paused.",
    "I expect theyll be hungry.",
    "Roast chicken do you think said Lucy.",
    "And apple tart Alexanders very\nfond of apple tart.",
    "The two boys arrived the next morning.",
    "Alexander Eastley had fair hair\nand blue eyes StoddartWest was dark and wore glasses.",
    "During lunch they\ntalked seriously about sport and occasionally about space travel.",
    "The roast\nchicken was eaten very quickly and every bit of apple tart disappeared.",
    "Mr Crackenthorpe said You two will soon eat all my money.",
    "Alexander\nlooked at him.",
    "Well have bread and cheese if you cant afford meat\nGrandfather.",
    "Of course I can afford it but I dont like waste.",
    "We havent wasted any sir said StoddartWest looking down at his empty\nplate.",
    "After she had washed up Lucy went out.",
    "She could hear the boys calling\nto each other on the lawn.",
    "She went down the front drive and began to hunt\namongst the bushes with the help of her golf club.",
    "Suddenly the polite voice of\nAlexander Eastley made her turn.",
    "Are you looking for something Miss Eyelesbarrow\nA golf ball said Lucy.",
    "Several golf balls in fact.",
    "Well help you said Alexander.",
    "Thats very kind of you.",
    "I thought you were playing football.",
    "One cant go on playing football explained StoddartWest.",
    "One gets too\nhot.",
    "Do you play a lot of golf\nI do enjoy it but I dont get much opportunity.",
    "Theres a clock golf set in the house Alexander said.",
    "We could fix it up\non the lawn and have a game.",
    "Encouraged by Lucy the boys went off to get it.",
    "Later as she returned to\n\n\fthe house she found them setting it out on the lawn.",
    "Its a pity the set is so old said StoddartWest.",
    "You can hardly see the\nnumbers.",
    "It needs some white paint said Lucy.",
    "You could get some tomorrow.",
    "Good idea.",
    "Alexander said.",
    "But I think there are some old pots of paint in\nthe Long Barn.",
    "Shall we go and look\nWhats the Long Barn asked Lucy.",
    "Alexander pointed to a long stone building near the back drive.",
    "A lot of\ngrandfathers statue collection is in there.",
    "And it is sometimes used for Womens\nInstitute events.",
    "Come and see it.",
    "Lucy followed the boys to the barn which had a big wooden door.",
    "Alexander took a key from a nail near the top of the door then he turned it in the\nlock.",
    "Inside there were three big ugly statues and an even bigger sarcophagus.",
    "Besides these there were two folding tables and some piles of chairs.",
    "Alexander\nfound two pots of paint and some brushes in a corner then the boys went off\nleaving Lucy alone.",
    "She stood looking at the furniture at the statues at the sarcophagus...\nwhich had a heavy closefitting lid.",
    "She looked around and on the floor found a\nbig crowbar.",
    "It was not easy but she worked with determination and slowly the lid\nbegan to rise enough for Lucy to see what was inside...\n\n\fCHAPTER SIX\nA few minutes later she left the barn locked the door put the key back on\nthe nail then drove down to the telephone box.",
    "I want to speak to Miss Marple.",
    "Shes resting and Im not going to wake her.",
    "You must wake her.",
    "Its urgent.",
    "Florence did not argue any more.",
    "Soon Miss Marples voice spoke.",
    "Yes\nLucy\nIve found it.",
    "A womans body\nYes.",
    "A woman in a fur coat.",
    "Its in a sarcophagus in a barn near the house.",
    "I think I ought to inform the police.",
    "Yes.",
    "You must inform the police.",
    "But the first thing theyll want to know is why I was lifting up that great\nheavy lid.",
    "Do you want me to invent a reason\nNo said Miss Marple you must tell the truth.",
    "About you\nAbout everything.",
    "Lucy suddenly smiled.",
    "That will be easy for me She said goodbye and\nrang the police station.",
    "Then she drove back to Rutherford Hall and went to the\nlibrary where Miss Crackenthorpe was reading to her father.",
    "Can I speak to you Miss Crackenthorpe\nEmma looked up a little nervously.",
    "Well speak up girl speak up said old Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Lucy said to\nEmma Id like to speak to you alone please.",
    "Just a moment Father.",
    "Emma got up and went out into the hall.",
    "Lucy\nfollowed her and shut the door behind them.",
    "Emma said If you think theres too much work with the boys here I can\nhelp you and\nIts not that said Lucy.",
    "But I didnt want to speak before your father\n\n\fbecause it might give him a shock.",
    "You see Ive just discovered the body of a\nmurdered woman in that sarcophagus in the Long Barn.",
    "In the sarcophagus A murdered woman Its impossible\nIm afraid its true.",
    "Ive told the police.",
    "They will be here very soon.",
    "Emmas face went a little red.",
    "You should have told me first  before\ntelling the police.",
    "Im sorry said Lucy as they heard the sound of a car outside and the\ndoorbell rang through the house.",
    "Im very sorry to have asked you to do this said Inspector Bacon as he led\nEmma Crackenthorpe out of the barn.",
    "Emmas face was pale but she walked steadily.",
    "I have never seen the\nwoman before.",
    "Thank you Miss Crackenthorpe.",
    "Thats all I wanted to know.",
    "I must go to my father.",
    "I telephoned Dr Quimper as soon as I heard about\nthis.",
    "Dr Quimper came out of the library as they crossed the hall.",
    "He was a tall\nfriendlylooking man.",
    "You were right to call me Emma he said.",
    "Your fathers\nall right.",
    "Just go in and see him then get yourself a glass of brandy.",
    "Thats\ndoctors orders.",
    "Emma smiled at him gratefully and went into the library.",
    "Shes one of the best he said looking after her.",
    "A pity she never married.",
    "She cares too much for her father I suppose said Inspector Bacon.",
    "She doesnt care that much  but her father likes being an invalid so she\nlets him be an invalid.",
    "Shes the same with her brothers.",
    "Cedric thinks hes a\ngood painter Harold believes he is good with money and Alfred enjoys\nshocking her with his stories of his clever deals.",
    "Well do you want me to have a\nlook at the body now the police doctor has finished\nId like you to have a look yes Doctor.",
    "We want to get her identified.",
    "I\nsuppose its impossible for old Mr Crackenthorpe It would upset him too\nmuch\nUpset him Nonsense.",
    "Hed never forgive you if you didnt let him have a\nlook.",
    "Its the most exciting thing thats happened to him for years  and it wont\n\n\fcost him anything\nTheres nothing really wrong with him then\nHes seventytwo.",
    "Thats all thats wrong with him.",
    "Come on lets go and\nsee this body of yours.",
    "Unpleasant I suppose\nThe police doctor says shes been dead for two or three weeks.",
    "Very unpleasant then.",
    "Dr Quimper stood by the sarcophagus and looked down at the body.",
    "Ive\nnever seen her before.",
    "She must have been quite good looking once.",
    "Who found\nher\nMiss Lucy Eyelesbarrow.",
    "They went out again into the fresh air.",
    "What was she doing looking inside a sarcophagus\nThat said Inspector Bacon is just what I am going to ask her.",
    "Now about\nMr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Will you\nDisgusting Mr Crackenthorpe came out of the house.",
    "I brought back that\nsarcophagus from Rome in 1908  or was it 1909\nCalm yourself the doctor said.",
    "This isnt going to be nice you know.",
    "I may be ill but Ive got to do my duty havent I\nA very short visit inside the Long Barn was however long enough.",
    "Mr\nCrackenthorpe came out into the air again with surprising speed.",
    "Ive never seen\nher before It wasnt Rome  I remember now  it was Naples.",
    "A very fine\nexample.",
    "And some stupid woman is found dead in it He put a hand on his\nchest.",
    "Oh my heart...",
    "Doctor...",
    "Doctor Quimper took his arm.",
    "Youll be all right after you have had a\nsmall brandy.",
    "They went back together towards the house.",
    "And now Bacon said to himself for Miss Lucy Eyelesbarrow\nLucy had just finished preparing potatoes for dinner when she was\ninformed that Inspector Bacon wanted to see her.",
    "So she followed the policeman\nto a room where he was waiting.",
    "Now Miss Eyelesbarrow Inspector Bacon said.",
    "You went into the Long\nBarn to find some paint.",
    "Is that right And after you found the paint you forced\n\n\fup the lid of this sarcophagus and found the body.",
    "What were you looking for in\nthe sarcophagus\nI was looking for a body said Lucy.",
    "You were looking for a body  and you found one Doesnt that seem to\nyou a very extraordinary story\nOh yes it is an extraordinary story.",
    "And Lucy told it to him.",
    "The Inspector was shocked.",
    "Are you telling me that you were asked by an\nold lady to get a job here and to search the house and grounds for a dead body\nYes.",
    "Who is this old lady\nMiss Jane Marple.",
    "She is at the moment living at 4 Madison Road.",
    "The Inspector wrote it down.",
    "Do you really expect me to believe this\nLucy said Not perhaps until after you have spoken to Miss Marple.",
    "I shall speak to her all right.",
    "She must be mad.",
    "Lucy did not reply to this.",
    "Instead she said What are you going to tell\nMiss Crackenthorpe About me\nWhy do you ask\nWell Ive done what I came here for.",
    "But Im still supposed to be working\nfor Miss Crackenthorpe and there are two hungry boys in the house and\nprobably some more of the family will arrive after all this upset.",
    "She needs help\nbut if you tell her that I only took this job in order to hunt for dead bodies shell\nprobably tell me to leave.",
    "The Inspector looked hard at her.",
    "Im not saying anything to anyone at\npresent because I dont yet know whether your statement is true.",
    "Lucy got up.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Then Ill go back to the kitchen and get on with\nthings.",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\nSo you think we should ask the police in London to help us with this\nThe Chief Constable looked at Inspector Bacon.",
    "You think we should speak to\nScotland Yard\nThe woman wasnt from the local area sir Bacon said.",
    "We believe because of her underwear  that she might have been foreign.",
    "But of course Im\nnot saying anything about that until after the inquest tomorrow.",
    "Other members\nof the Crackenthorpe family will be here for it and theres a chance one of them\nmight be able to identify her.",
    "There is no reason is there to believe the Crackenthorpe family are\nconnected with the crime in any way the Chief Constable asked.",
    "Not apart from the fact that the body was found on their land said\nInspector Bacon.",
    "What I cant understand is this nonsense about the train.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "Youve been to see this old lady this  er \nMiss Marple sir.",
    "Yes shes certain about what her friend saw.",
    "Im sure\nshes just imagining it but she did ask this young woman to look for a body which she did.",
    "And found one said the Chief Constable.",
    "Miss Jane Marple  the name\nseems familiar somehow...",
    "Anyway Ill speak to Scotland Yard.",
    "I think you are\nright about it not being a local case.",
    "The inquest was a formal affair.",
    "No one came forward to identify the dead\nwoman.",
    "Lucy was asked to give evidence of finding the body and medical\nevidence was given about the cause of death  she had been strangled.",
    "It was a cold windy day when the Crackenthorpe family came out of the\nhall.",
    "There were five of them Emma Cedric Harold Alfred and Bryan Eastley\nthe husband of the dead daughter Edith.",
    "There was also Mr Wimborne the\nfamilys London lawyer.",
    "They all stood for a moment on the pavement.",
    "A small\ncrowd had gathered there the story of the Body in the Sarcophagus had been\nfully reported in both the London and the local Press.",
    "Voices were heard saying Thats them...\nEmma said sharply Lets get away.",
    "She got into the big hired car with\nLucy.",
    "Mr Wimborne Cedric and Harold followed.",
    "Bryan Eastley said Ill take Alfred in my car.",
    "The Daimler was about to leave when Emma cried Oh stop There are\nthe boys\nAlexander and James had been left behind at Rutherford Hall but now\nthey suddenly appeared.",
    "We came on our bicycles said StoddartWest.",
    "The\npoliceman was very kind and let us in at the back of the hall.",
    "But it was rather disappointing said Alexander.",
    "All over so soon.",
    "We cant stay here talking said Harold angrily.",
    "Theres all those men with\ncameras.",
    "He gave a sign to the driver who drove away down the road.",
    "All over so soon said Cedric.",
    "Thats what they think the young\ninnocents Its just beginning.",
    "Its most unfortunate Harold said.",
    "By the way Miss  er  Eyelesbarrow\nwhy were you looking in that sarcophagus\nThey all looked at Lucy.",
    "She had wondered when one of the family would\nask her this and had already prepared her answer.",
    "I dont know...",
    "I did feel that\nthe whole place needed to be cleaned.",
    "And there was she paused a very\nunpleasant smell...\nMr Wimborne said Yes yes of course... but this unfortunate young\nwoman was nothing to do with any of us.",
    "Ah but you cant be so sure of that can you said Cedric.",
    "Lucy looked at\nhim with interest.",
    "She had already noticed that the three brothers were very\ndifferent.",
    "Cedric was a big man with untidy dark hair and a cheerful manner.",
    "He\nwas still wearing the clothes in which he had arrived from the airport old grey\ntrousers and an old brown jacket.",
    "He looked bohemian and proud of it.",
    "His brother Harold was the opposite the perfect picture of a City\ngentleman.",
    "He was tall with smooth dark hair and was dressed in a suit and a\npale grey tie.",
    "He said Really Cedric that seems a most unnecessary remark.",
    "Why She was in our barn so what did she come there for Mr Wimborne\ncoughed.",
    "Possibly some  er  romantic meeting.",
    "I have heard that all the locals\nknew that the key was kept outside on a nail.",
    "Emma said Yes it was for the Womens Institute people.",
    "Mr Wimborne coughed again.",
    "It seems probable that the barn was used in\nthe winter by local lovers.",
    "There was a disagreement and some young man lost\ncontrol of himself.",
    "Then he saw the sarcophagus and he realized that it would\n\n\fmake an excellent hiding place.",
    "If I was a girl coming to meet my young man I wouldnt like being taken\nto a freezing cold barn Cedric replied.",
    "Id want a nice warm cinema wouldnt\nyou Miss Eyelesbarrow\nDo we really need to discuss all this Harold said.",
    "But as he asked the question the car stopped outside the front door of\nRutherford Hall.",
    "CHAPTER EIGHT\nAs he entered the library Mr Wimborne looked past Inspector Bacon\nwhom he had already met to the fairhaired good looking man behind him.",
    "This is Detective Inspector Craddock of Scotland Yard Inspector Bacon\nsaid.",
    "Dermot Craddock smiled at Mr Wimborne.",
    "As you are representing the\nCrackenthorpe family I think that we should give you some confidential\ninformation.",
    "We believe that the dead woman travelled down here from London\nand that she had recently come from abroad.",
    "Probably from France.",
    "Now I\nwould like to have a quick talk with each member of the family...",
    "I really cannot see...\nWhat they can tell me Probably nothing.",
    "I expect I can get most of the\ninformation I want from you.",
    "Information about this house and the family.",
    "And how can that possibly be connected with an unknown woman coming\nfrom abroad and being killed here\nWell thats the question said Craddock.",
    "Why did she come here Had\nshe once had some connection with this house Had she been perhaps a servant\nhere Or did she come to meet someone else who had lived at Rutherford Hall\nCan you give me a short history of the family\nThere is very little to tell said Wimborne.",
    "Josiah Crackenthorpe made\nsweet and savoury biscuits.",
    "He became very rich.",
    "He built this house.",
    "Luther\nCrackenthorpe his eldest son lives here now.",
    "And the present Mr Crackenthorpe has never thought of selling the\nhouse\nHe is unable to do so said the lawyer.",
    "Because of his fathers will.",
    "Perhaps youll tell me about the will\nJosiah Crackenthorpe left his great fortune in trust the income from it to\nbe paid to his son Luther for life and after Luthers death the capital to be\ndivided equally between Luthers children Edmund Cedric Harold Alfred\nEmma and Edith.",
    "Edmund was killed in the war and Edith died four years ago\nso that on Luther Crackenthorpes death the money will be divided between\nCedric Harold Alfred Emma and Ediths son Alexander Eastley.",
    "And the house\n\n\fThat will go to Luther Crackenthorpes eldest living son or his children.",
    "Was Edmund Crackenthorpe married\nNo.",
    "So the property will actually go\nTo the next son  Cedric said Mr Wimborne.",
    "So at present the next generation have no income except what they make\nor what their father gives them and their father has a large income but no control\nof the capital.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Mr Wimborne stood up.",
    "I am now going back to London.",
    "Unless\nthere is anything more you wish to know.",
    "Lucy had gone straight to the kitchen when she got back from the inquest\nand was busy preparing lunch when Bryan Eastley came in.",
    "Can I help in any way he asked.",
    "Lucy gave him a quick look.",
    "Bryan had arrived alone at the inquest in his\nsmall M.G.",
    "sports car and she had not had much time to study him.",
    "She now\nsaw a friendlylooking man about thirty years old with fair hair and blue eyes.",
    "The boys arent back yet he said sitting on the end of the kitchen table.",
    "Lucy smiled.",
    "They were determined not to miss anything.",
    "Do you mind\ngetting off the table Mr Eastley I want to put this hot dish down there.",
    "Bryan obeyed.",
    "Do you mind me talking to you\nIf you came in to help Id rather you helped.",
    "Lucy took another dish from\nthe oven.",
    "Here  turn all these potatoes over so that they will get brown on the\nother side.",
    "Bryan did as he was told.",
    "Then he watched Lucy pour the Yorkshire\npudding mixture into the dish.",
    "This is fun.",
    "It reminds me of being in our kitchen\nat home  when I was a boy.",
    "There was something strangely sad about Bryan Eastley Lucy thought.",
    "Looking closely at him she realized that he must be nearer forty than thirty.",
    "He\nreminded her of the many young pilots she had known during the war when she\nhad been only fourteen.",
    "She had gone on and grown up into a postwar world but she felt that Bryan had not gone on but had been left behind.",
    "She\nremembered what Emma had told her.",
    "You were a fighter pilot werent you\n\n\fYouve got a medal.",
    "Yes and if youve got a medal people try to make things easy for you.",
    "They give you a job which is very good of them.",
    "But theyre all office jobs and\nIm just not any good at that sort of thing.",
    "Ive had ideas of my own but... if I had\na bit of capital...",
    "He paused.",
    "At that moment Alexander and StoddartWest arrived.",
    "Hello Bryan said Alexander to his father.",
    "Oh what a good piece of\nmeat.",
    "Is there Yorkshire pudding\nYes there is said Lucy.",
    "Shes an excellent cook.",
    "Alexander spoke to Bryan like a kindly father to\nhis son.",
    "Can we help you Miss Eyelesbarrow asked StoddartWest.",
    "Yes you can.",
    "Alexander go and ring the bell.",
    "James will you carry this\ndish into the dining room And will you take the meat in Mr Eastley Ill bring\nthe potatoes and the Yorkshire pudding.",
    "When Lucy came out into the hall Mr Wimborne was standing there\nputting on his coat Emma was coming down the stairs and two police officers\nwere coming out of the library.",
    "Mr Wimborne took Emmas hand in his.",
    "Now this is Detective Inspector\nCraddock from Scotland Yard who has come to take charge of the case.",
    "And he\nhas just told me that this almost certainly was not a local crime.",
    "They think she\ncame from London and was probably foreign.",
    "Emma Crackenthorpe said sharply Was she French\n\n\fCHAPTER NINE\nAfter lunch the police officers asked if they could talk to Mr Cedric\nCrackenthorpe.",
    "Inspector Craddock said I hear you have just come from Ibiza\nYou live out there\nIts better than this boring country.",
    "You get more sunshine than we do I expect said Inspector Craddock.",
    "But you came home not very long ago  for Christmas.",
    "What made you come\nback again so soon\nCedric smiled.",
    "I got a call from my sister.",
    "Weve never had a murder here\nbefore and I didnt want to miss anything.",
    "Also I thought poor Emma might need\na bit of help  managing the old man and the police and everything.",
    "I see.",
    "Although her two other brothers have also come to be with her.",
    "But not to cheer her up Cedric said.",
    "Harold is very angry about it.",
    "Its not\nat all suitable for a City man to be mixed up with the murder of a strange\nfemale.",
    "Was she  a strange female Inspector Craddock asked.",
    "I thought perhaps\nyou might be able to guess who she was Cedric shook his head.",
    "I have no\nidea.",
    "Craddock leaned back in his chair.",
    "As you heard at the inquest the time of\ndeath was between two and four weeks ago  which makes it somewhere around\nChristmas.",
    "When did you arrive in England and when did you leave\nCedric thought.",
    "I got here on the Saturday before Christmas  that would\nbe the 21st.",
    "You flew straight here\nYes and got here at midday.",
    "I flew back on the following Friday the 27th.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Cedric smiled.",
    "That puts me well within the time of the murder\nunfortunately.",
    "But really Inspector strangling young women is not my favourite\nform of Christmas fun.",
    "So what do you think of him Craddock asked Bacon as Cedric shut the\ndoor behind him.",
    "I dont like that type Bacon said.",
    "Dirty trousers and did you see his tie\n\n\fIt looked as though it was made of coloured string.",
    "Hes just the type who would\nstrangle a woman and think nothing about it.",
    "Well he didnt strangle this one  if he didnt leave Ibiza until the 21st.",
    "And thats a thing we can easily check.",
    "Bacon looked at him.",
    "I notice that youre not telling them the actual date of\nthe crime.",
    "No well keep quiet about that for a bit.",
    "Now well see what our correct\nCity gentleman has to say about it all.",
    "Harold Crackenthorpe had very little to say about it.",
    "No he had no idea\nwho the dead woman was.",
    "Yes he had been at Rutherford Hall for Christmas.",
    "He had been unable to come down until Christmas Eve  but had stayed on over\nthe following weekend.",
    "Inspector Craddock then asked to see Alfred and when he came into the\nroom Craddock felt that he had seen him somewhere before.",
    "He asked Alfred\nwhat job he did.",
    "Im in insurance at the moment.",
    "Until recently Ive been interested in\nputting a new type of talking machine on the market.",
    "I did very well out of that.",
    "Inspector Craddock smiled  but he was noticing how Alfreds suit which\nhad looked smart when he came in was really very cheap.",
    "Cedrics clothes had\nbeen dirty but they had been made of excellent material.",
    "Alfreds cheap\nsmartness told its own story.",
    "Craddock began to ask his usual questions and\nAlfred seemed interested.",
    "Its quite an idea that the woman might once have had a job here.",
    "But as\nEmma didnt recognize her I think thats unlikely.",
    "And if the woman came from\nLondon... What made you think she came from London by the way\nInspector Craddock smiled and shook his head.",
    "Not telling eh Alfred said.",
    "Did she have a return ticket in her coat\npocket is that it\nInspector Craddock thanked Alfred and let him go.",
    "I dont suppose you want to see me said Bryan Eastley coming into the\nroom.",
    "I dont really belong to the family.",
    "You were the husband of Miss Edith Crackenthorpe who died five years\nago Inspector Craddock asked.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Well its very kind of you Mr Eastley especially if you know something\nthat could help us.",
    "But I dont.",
    "I wish I did.",
    "Is it true that she was foreign\nShe may have been French said Inspector Bacon.",
    "Bryans blue eyes suddenly looked interested.",
    "Really Inspector Craddock\nsaid Has anybody in the family got any French connections that you know of\nBryan shook his head.",
    "Im not being very helpful am I He smiled.",
    "But\nAlexander and James are out every day hunting for clues.",
    "Theyll probably find\nsomething for you.",
    "Inspector Craddock said he hoped they would then said he would like to\nspeak to Miss Emma Crackenthorpe.",
    "Inspector Craddock looked more carefully at Emma Crackenthorpe than he\nhad done before.",
    "He was still wondering about the expression on her face before\nlunch when Wimborne had said the murdered woman was foreign.",
    "As you have heard we believe the dead woman came from abroad which\nmakes it more difficult for us to identify her.",
    "But didnt she have anything  a handbag Papers Craddock shook his\nhead.",
    "You have no idea of her name  of where she came from  anything at all\nShes very anxious to know who the woman is Craddock thought.",
    "We know nothing about her he said.",
    "Can you think of anyone she might\nbe\nI have no idea at all.",
    "There was a hardness in Inspector Craddocks voice as he asked When Mr\nWimborne told you that the woman was foreign why did you assume that she\nwas French\nEmma remained calm.",
    "Did I I dont really know why  except that most\nforeigners in this country are French arent they\nOh I really dont think so Miss Crackenthorpe.",
    "People from so many\ncountries come here Italians Germans Belgians... Craddock looked at\nInspector Bacon who showed her a small powder compact.",
    "Do you recognize\n\n\fthis Miss Crackenthorpe\nNo.",
    "Its not mine.",
    "Youve no idea whose it is\nNo.",
    "Then I dont think we need worry you any more  for the present.",
    "Thank you.",
    "She smiled got up and left the room.",
    "Do you think she knows anything asked Bacon.",
    "Inspector Craddock said I often think that everyone knows more than they\nwant to tell you but...",
    "But suddenly the door was thrown open and old Mr Crackenthorpe came\nin looking extremely angry.",
    "So Scotland Yard comes here and doesnt have the\ngood manners to talk to the head of the family first Tell me who is the Master\nof this house\nYou are of course Mr Crackenthorpe said Craddock standing up.",
    "But\nwe thought that you had already told Inspector Bacon all you know and as Dr\nQuimper said...",
    "Yes yes I am not a strong man... but Dr Quimper is like a silly old\nwoman sometimes.",
    "And there has been a murder in my own house  well in my\nown barn So what do you want to know Whats your theory\nIts a bit early for theories Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "We are still trying to find\nout who the woman was.",
    "Foreign you say\nWe think so.",
    "And you think she was involved with one of my sons If so she would be\nAlfreds woman.",
    "And some violent fellow followed her down here thinking she\nwas coming to meet Alfred and killed her.",
    "Hows that\nBut Mr Alfred Crackenthorpe did not recognize her Inspector Craddock\nsaid.",
    "Hes a liar always was And he left the room.",
    "Alfreds woman said Bacon.",
    "I dont think Alfred is who were looking\nfor  but I did just wonder about that Air Force fellow.",
    "Bryan Eastley\nYes.",
    "Ive met one or two like him.",
    "They had danger and death and\nexcitement too early.",
    "Now they find life boring and they dont mind risking\nthings.",
    "If Eastley were mixed up with a woman and wanted to kill her...",
    "He\nstopped But if you do kill a woman why put her in your fatherinlaws\nsarcophagus No none of this family had anything to do with the murder.",
    "Bacon\nstood up.",
    "Anything more you want to do here\nCraddock said there wasnt so he was going to call on an old friend.",
    "CHAPTER TEN\nMiss Marple sitting very straight on Florences sofa smiled at Inspector\nDermot Craddock.",
    "Im so glad that you have been asked to help with the case.",
    "I\nhoped you would be.",
    "When I got your letter said Craddock I took it straight to the A.C. the\nAssistant Commissioner.",
    "And he had just heard from the Brackhampton people\nasking for our help.",
    "The A.C. was very interested in what I had to tell him about\nyou.",
    "He had heard about you from my godfather.",
    "Dear Sir Henry said Miss Marple.",
    "So he sent me to look into the case and here I am Of course this meeting\nis not an official one.",
    "Im hoping you can put yourself in the murderers place\nand tell me where he is now Miss Marple shook her head.",
    "I wish I could.",
    "But\nIve no idea.",
    "Although he must be someone who knows all about Rutherford\nHall.",
    "I agree.",
    "But that includes so many people.",
    "A lot of women have worked\nthere.",
    "And theres the Womens Institute and other groups.",
    "They all know the\nLong Barn and where the key was kept.",
    "Also well never begin to solve the crime\nuntil we identify the body.",
    "And that too may be difficult\nOh well get there  in the end.",
    "Were checking up on all disappearances of\na woman of that age.",
    "Her fur coat is a cheap one bought in London.",

    "Hundreds of them are sold in Paris.",
    "Have you any more\nideas for me\nI was thinking about theatrical companies said Miss Marple.",

    "You cant like all the things you have to do.",
    "Lucy laughed.",
    "Not everything perhaps but cooking satisfies my wish to\nbe creative and I really enjoy making things tidy.",
    "I dont like things to be tidy said Cedric.",
    "Yes I can see that.",
    "Some bricks fell out of the pigsty and Cedric turned to look inside it.",
    "Dear\nold Madge used to live here.",
    "She was such a friendly animal and such a good\nmother.",
    "We used to come here and scratch her back with a stick.",
    "She loved it.",
    "Why has this whole place been allowed to get into such a state It cant\nonly be the war.",

    "No its not only the\nwar.",
    "Its my father.",
    "He refuses to spend any money on the place.",
    "Of course he\nhates all of us  except perhaps Emma.",
    "Thats because of my grandfathers will.",

    "Martinet\n\n\fYes.",
    "She sent that telegram at about the same time... Do you think she\nmight after all have come down here and...",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Why would Martine come down here and go to the Long\nBarn\nYou dont think perhaps that I ought to tell Inspector Bacon  or the other\none\nTell him what\nWell  about Martine.",
    "About her letter.",
    "Now dont start making things complicated Emma.",
    "I was never sure that\nletter was from Martine anyway.",

    "I think its unlikely said Dr Quimper.",
    "Im wondering if I ought to tell the police about it all.",
    "Cedric and the\nothers say its unnecessary.",
    "What do you think\nDr Quimper was silent for a moment then he said Its much simpler if\nyou say nothing.",
    "I can understand what your brothers feel about it.",
    "But...",
    "Yes\nHe looked at her and smiled.",
    "I would just tell them.",
    "Youll keep worrying\nif you dont.",

    "Dermot Craddock sat at his desk at Scotland Yard talking into the\ntelephone in French.",
    "It was only an idea you understand.",
    "Yes said the voice from the Paris police.",

    "Please be careful how you tell Father.",
    "Hell probably go mad.",

    "Later he was definitely reported killed.",
    "It\nwas just before Dunkirk  and a time of great confusion.",
    "There was no Army\nrecord of his marriage so I was very surprised to receive a letter just about a\nmonth ago signed Martine Crackenthorpe.",
    "Do you have it\n\n\fEmma took the letter from her bag and handed it to Craddock who read it.",
    "Dear Mademoiselle\nI hope it will not be a shock to you to get this letter.",
    "I do not even know if\nyour brother Edmund told you that we were married.",
    "He was killed only a few\ndays afterwards.",
    "After the war ended I decided that I would not contact you.",
    "I\nhad made a new life for myself but now things have changed.",
    "It is for my son\nthat I write this letter.",
    "He is your brothers son you see and I can no longer give\nhim the advantages he ought to have.",

    "Yours sincerely\nMartine Crackenthorpe\nCraddock gave the letter back to Emma.",
    "What did you do when you\nreceived this\nI wrote to the address she gave and invited her to come down to\nRutherford Hall.",
    "A few days later I received a message from London Very sorry\nhad to return to France unexpectedly.",
    "Martine.",
    "There were no more letters.",
    "All this happened  when\nJust before Christmas.",
    "And you believe that the woman whose body was found in the\nsarcophagus might be this Martine\nNo of course I dont.",
    "But when you said she was probably foreign  well I\ncouldnt help wondering...\nCraddock said You were quite right to tell me about this.",
    "Well make some\ninquiries.",
    "He paused.",
    "Did you tell your father and your brothers about the\nletter\nI had to tell my father of course.",
    "He got very angry she smiled faintly.",
    "He was sure it was all made up to get money out of us.",
    "I also told my brothers.",
    "Harold thought it was made up too and that I should be very careful.",
    "Alfred\nthought the same but also that it was rather funny.",
    "Cedric just wasnt interested.",
    "But we all thought that the family should meet Martine and that our lawyer Mr\n\n\fWimborne should be with us.",
    "Did you try to contact her after you received the message\nYes.",
    "I wrote to the address in London with Please forward on the\nenvelope but I have had no reply.",
    "Rather a strange business...",
    "He looked at her sharply.",
    "What were your\nfeelings about it if this girl really was your brothers widow\nEmmas face softened.",
    "Edmund was my favourite brother so it seemed\nright for Martine to ask his family for help as he had wanted her to do.",
    "The letter\nseemed real to me  but as Harold said if it was written by someone pretending\nto be Martine they must have known her very well for people to believe the\nletter came from her.",
    "But still... She stopped.",
    "You wanted it to be true said Craddock gently.",
    "Yes I wanted it to be true.",
    "I would be so happy if Edmund had left a son.",
    "Craddock nodded.",
    "As you say the letter sounds genuine.",
    "What is\nsurprising is what followed.",
    "You had replied kindly to her so why even if she\nhad to go back to France did she not write again That is if she really was\nEdmunds widow.",
    "Did perhaps one of your brothers make inquiries that\nfrightened her But of course if Edmund Crackenthorpe left a son he would be\none of the heirs to your grandfathers estate\nEmma nodded.",
    "Well dont worry.",
    "There is probably no connection at all between the\nwoman who wrote the letter and the woman whose body was found in the\nsarcophagus.",
    "Emma stood up.",
    "Im so glad I told you.",
    "When she had gone Craddock rang for Detective Sergeant Wetherall.",
    "Bob I want you to go to 126 Elvers Crescent N10.",
    "Take photographs of the\ndead woman with you.",
    "Ask about a woman calling herself Mrs Martine\nCrackenthorpe who was either living there or calling for letters there between\nthe 15th to the end of December.",
    "Right sir.",
    "Craddock was occupied with other matters for the rest of the day but when\nhe returned to his office he found a message from Paris on his desk.",
    "Details given by you might fit Anna Stravinska of Ballet Maritski.",
    "Suggest\nyou come over.",
    "Dessin.",
    "Craddock smiled.",
    "At last Forget Martine Crackenthorpe.",
    "He would go to\nParis tonight.",
    "CHAPTER THIRTEEN\nIts so very kind of you to have asked me to tea said Miss Marple to\nEmma Crackenthorpe.",
    "Looking like a picture of a sweet old lady she smiled round her  at Harold\nin his dark suit at Alfred handing her sandwiches at Cedric standing by the\nfireplace wearing a very old jacket.",
    "We are pleased that you could come said Emma politely.",
    "This wasnt really true.",
    "When she had said to her brothers Oh I told Miss\nEyelesbarrow that she could bring her aunt to tea today they had not been\npleased.",
    "Tell her not to come said Harold.",
    "Weve still got a lot to talk about and\ndont want strangers here.",
    "Let her have tea in the kitchen with the girl said Alfred.",
    "Oh let her come said Cedric.",
    "We can ask her about the wonderful Lucy.",
    "Im not sure that I trust her.",
    "Shes much too clever.",
    "Shes quite genuine Ive made inquiries about her said Harold then\nadded Emma you must have been mad telling the police that the dead woman\nmight be Edmunds French wife.",
    "It will make them think that one of us killed\nher.",
    "I told her not to said Cedric.",
    "Then Dr Quimper encouraged her to tell\nthem.",
    "And now this old woman is coming to tea.",
    "Just when we want to think\nsaid Harold.",
    "But Miss Marple now sat by the fire smiling up at Emma.",
    "What a beautiful\nhouse you have.",
    "And how delightful to have your brothers with you.",
    "So often\nfamilies are separated.",
    "Tell us about Lucy as a child Miss Marple said Cedric.",
    "Lucy was always so clever she said.",
    "Yes you were dear  particularly at\narithmetic.",
    "Why I remember when the butcher overcharged me for a chicken...\nMiss Marples memories were interrupted by Bryan and the boys coming\nin.",
    "Then tea was brought and with it came Dr Quimper.",
    "I hope your fathers not ill Emma\n\n\fOh no  he was just a little tired this afternoon.",
    "Avoiding visitors I expect said Miss Marple with a smile.",
    "Dr Quimper\nwho was eating coffee cake with great enthusiasm said What a good cook you\nare Emma\nNot mine.",
    "Miss Eyelesbarrows.",
    "You make them just as good said Quimper loyally.",
    "Will you come and see Father She got up and the doctor followed her.",
    "Miss Marple watched them leave the room.",
    "Miss Crackenthorpe is a very\nloving daughter.",
    "I cant imagine why said Cedric.",
    "Father cares about her very much said Harold quickly.",
    "Well he knows\nthat Emma will always take care of him.",
    "Shell never get married.",
    "Miss Marples eyes widened.",
    "Really I think that Miss Crackenthorpe will\nprobably marry late in life  and successfully.",
    "Thats not very likely living here said Cedric.",
    "She never meets anybody\nshe could marry.",
    "Miss Marples eyes widened even more.",
    "There are always vicars  and\ndoctors.",
    "She looked at each of them and it was clear that what she had suggested\ndid not please them.",
    "She stood up.",
    "So kind of you to invite me.",
    "Ive been\nwondering just what your home was like  so that I can imagine dear Lucy\nworking here.",
    "Lucy took Miss Marple home.",
    "On her way back a figure stepped out of\nthe darkness and stood into the light from the car just as she was turning into the\nback lane.",
    "He held up his hand and Lucy recognized Alfred Crackenthorpe.",
    "Thats better he said as he got in.",
    "Rutherford Hall is so dull.",
    "I thought Id\nlike a nice walk but its cold How do you manage staying here Lucy You dont\nmind if I call you Lucy do you\nNot at all.",
    "I dont find it dull.",
    "But youre a clever girl.",
    "Too clever to waste yourself cooking and\ncleaning.",
    "Thank you but I prefer cooking and cleaning to office work.",
    "But you could do something much more exciting.",
    "Like what\nWell I could use you in my business.",
    "His hand touched her arm.",
    "Youre a\nvery beautiful girl.",
    "Id like you as a partner.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Lucy drove the car into the yard and stopped.",
    "You mean no.",
    "But think about it.",
    "Ill get some money quite soon.",
    "My\nfather cant live forever.",
    "What about it Lucy\nWhat are the terms\nMarriage if you like.",
    "Oh.",
    "She laughed and opened the car door.",
    "This is no time for romance.",
    "Theres dinner to think about.",
    "They entered the house and Lucy hurried to the kitchen.",
    "After dinner she came out into the hall to find Harold Crackenthorpe\nwaiting for her.",
    "Miss Eyelesbarrow can I speak to you about something He opened the\ndoor of the sitting room and she followed him in.",
    "I shall be leaving early in the\nmorning but I want to tell you that I feel that you are too good to be working\nhere.",
    "Do you I dont.",
    "Well he cant ask me to marry him thought Lucy.",
    "Hes\ngot a wife already.",
    "When you have finished here come and see me in London.",
    "We could use\nsomeone of your ability in the company and I can offer you a very good salary.",
    "Lucy said Thank you Mr Crackenthorpe Ill think about it.",
    "Dont wait too long or you might miss the opportunity.",
    "Good night Miss\nEyelesbarrow.",
    "Then on her way up to bed Lucy met Cedric on the stairs.",
    "Lucy theres something I want to say to you.",
    "Do you want me to marry you and come to Ibiza and look after you\nCedric looked very surprised.",
    "No.",
    "Sorry.",
    "My mistake.",
    "I just wanted to know if you have a train timetable in the house\n\n\fIs that all Theres one on the hall table.",
    "You know said Cedric you shouldnt think everyone wants to marry you.",
    "Youre a good looking girl but not as good looking as all that.",
    "In fact youre the\nlast girl in the world I would want to marry.",
    "Really said Lucy.",
    "Perhaps youd prefer me as a stepmother\nWhat Cedric looked at her.",
    "You heard me said Lucy and went into her room and shut the door.",
    "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\nDermot Craddock had arrived at the Paris Police Station.",
    "Armand Dessin said I have a picture of the ballet dancers here  that is\nher the fourth from the left  do you recognize her\nA strangled young woman is not easy to recognize.",
    "It could be her\nInspector Craddock said.",
    "What do you know about her\nAlmost nothing Dessin said cheerfully.",
    "She was not important you see.",
    "And the Ballet Maritski  it is not important either.",
    "It has no famous ballerinas.",
    "But I will take you to see Madame Joilet who organizes it.",
    "Madame Joilet was a businesslike Frenchwoman.",
    "I do not like the police\nNo no Madame you must not say that said Dessin.",
    "Now about this girl\nAnna Stravinska.",
    "What about her said Madame.",
    "Is she Russian asked Inspector Craddock.",
    "No.",
    "But they all give themselves Russian names.",
    "She did not dance well\nshe was not good looking.",
    "Was she French\nPerhaps.",
    "But she told me that she had an English husband.",
    "Was he alive  or dead\nDead or he had left her.",
    "These girls  there is always some trouble with\nmen.",
    "When did you last see her\nI took my company to London for six weeks.",
    "Then we came back to\n\n\fFrance but Anna did not come.",
    "She sent a message that she was going to live\nwith her husbands family.",
    "I did not think it was true.",
    "I thought that she had met a\nman you understand.",
    "Inspector Craddock nodded.",
    "When was this\nWe returned to France the Sunday before Christmas.",
    "And Anna left two or three  days before that.",
    "Madame Joilet paused.",
    "Why do you want to find\nher\nWe think she may have been murdered.",
    "Madame Joilet turned away.",
    "It happens.",
    "Ah well She was a good\nCatholic.",
    "Did you know Madame if she had a son\nIf so I know nothing about it.",
    "Madame Joilet had nothing more to tell them.",
    "When they showed her the\npowder compact she said Anna had one like that but so had most of the other\ngirls.",
    "They then interviewed some of the girls who had worked with Anna.",
    "She liked to pretend things one of them said.",
    "She told stories about being\na film star in Hollywood.",
    "Another girl said In London she talked about a very rich man who was\ngoing to take her on a holiday around the world because she reminded him of\nhis daughter who had died in a car accident.",
    "None of this was helpful.",
    "The only fact they knew was that on 19th\nDecember Anna Stravinska had decided not to return to France and that on the\n20th December a woman looking a little like her had travelled to Brackhampton\nby the 4.33 train and had been strangled.",
    "And if the woman in the sarcophagus\nwas not Anna Stravinska where was Anna now\nTo that Madame Joilets answer was simple.",
    "With a man And it was\nprobably correct Craddock thought.",
    "But there was one other possibility that had\nto be considered  because Anna had once said that she had an English husband.",
    "Had that husband been Edmund Crackenthorpe\nIt seemed unlikely considering Annas character.",
    "What was much more\nprobable was that Anna had known Martine and so it might have been Anna who\nwrote that letter to Emma Crackenthorpe.",
    "When Craddock got back to the police station Sergeant Wetherall was\nwaiting with his report.",
    "126 Elvers Crescent is rented to students.",
    "Nobody could recognize the\nphotograph as that of a woman who had called for letters.",
    "Craddock nodded.",
    "Then he rang up the Crackenthorpes lawyers and asked\nfor an appointment with Mr Wimborne.",
    "The next day he was taken into a room where Mr Wimborne was sitting\nbehind a large desk.",
    "What can I do for you Inspector\nThis letter... Craddock pushed Martines letter across the table.",
    "Mr Wimborne looked at it.",
    "Yes Miss Emma Crackenthorpe informed me\nabout this yesterday morning.",
    "Extraordinary I should have been asked about it\nwhen it arrived I had never heard anything about Edmund getting married or\nhaving a son.",
    "What would she and the son expect to inherit legally  if she could prove\nher claim Craddock asked.",
    "Well if she could prove that the boy was the son of Edmund\nCrackenthorpe born after they were married then he would receive his share of\nJosiah Crackenthorpes money on the death of Luther Crackenthorpe.",
    "More than\nthat he would inherit Rutherford Hall since hes the son of the eldest son.",
    "Without that proof when Luther Crackenthorpe dies then Cedric gets it\nYes as the eldest living son.",
    "But Harold and Alfred Crackenthorpe seem to have been more upset than\nCedric by this letter.",
    "Is it true that theyre both a bit short of money Craddock\nasked.",
    "Mr Wimborne looked at him sharply.",
    "Oh So the police have been making\ninquiries Yes Alfred is always short of money.",
    "And Harold is at present in\nsome difficulty.",
    "But nobodys murdered Luther Crackenthorpe which is the only\nmurder that would do the family any good.",
    "So really Inspector I dont see\nwhere your ideas are leading you.",
    "The worst of it was Inspector Craddock thought that he wasnt very sure\nhimself.",
    "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\nInspector Craddock arranged to see Harold Crackenthorpe at his office\nand went there with Sergeant Wetherall.",
    "The office was in the City and inside\neverything looked very expensive and businesslike.",
    "Harold was sitting behind a leathertopped desk in his private room.",
    "Good\nmorning Inspector.",
    "I hope this means that you have some real news for us at\nlast\nI am afraid not Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Id just like to ask you a few more\nquestions.",
    "Well what is it this time\nCould you tell me exactly what you were doing on the afternoon and\nevening of 20th December last  say between the hours of 3 p.m. and midnight.",
    "Crackenthorpes face went an angry red.",
    "That seems to be a most\nextraordinary question.",
    "It is a question for several other people as well as you.",
    "said Craddock.",
    "Well of course  I would like to help in any way I can.",
    "He spoke into one\nof the telephones on his desk and a neat young woman entered.",
    "Miss Ellis the\nInspector would like to know what I was doing on the afternoon and evening of\nFriday 20lh December.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Miss Ellis left the room returned with a diary.",
    "You were in the\noffice on the morning of 20th December.",
    "You had a meeting with Mr Goldie\nabout the Cromartie business you lunched with Lord Forthville\nAh it was that day yes.",
    "You returned to the office about three oclock and later you went to\nSothebys where you were interested in some rare books which were being sold\nthat day.",
    "You did not return to the office but you were attending the Catering\nClub dinner that evening.",
    "Miss Ellis left the room.",
    "Yes said Harold.",
    "I went to Sothebys but the books I wanted went for too\nhigh a price.",
    "I had tea in a small place in Jermyn Street  Russells I think it was\ncalled then went home  I live at 43 Cardigan Gardens.",
    "The Catering Club\ndinner was at seven thirty and after it I returned home to bed.",
    "What time was it when you returned home to dress for the dinner Mr\nCrackenthorpe\n\n\fJust after six I think.",
    "And after your dinner\nIt was I think halfpast eleven when I got home.",
    "Did a servant let you in Or perhaps Lady Alice Crackenthorpe...\nMy wife is in the South of France.",
    "I let myself in.",
    "So there is no one who can say that you got home when you say you did\nHarold looked at him coldly.",
    "I expect the servants heard me come in.",
    "But\nreally Inspector\nPlease Mr Crackenthorpe I know these questions are annoying but I\nhave nearly finished.",
    "Do you own a car\nYes but I dont use it much except at weekends.",
    "But you use it when you go down to see your father and sister in\nBrackhampton\nNot unless I am going to stay there for a while.",
    "If I just go down for one\nnight  as for example to the inquest  I always go by train.",
    "Where do you keep your car\nI rent a garage behind Cardigan Gardens.",
    "Any more questions\nThats all for now said Inspector Craddock smiling.",
    "When they were outside Sergeant Wetherall said He didnt like those\nquestions at all.",
    "If you have not committed a murder it naturally annoys you if it seems\nsomeone thinks that you have said Inspector Craddock.",
    "But what we have to\nfind out is if anyone saw Harold Crackenthorpe at the rare book sale that\nafternoon and at the teashop.",
    "He could easily have travelled by the 4.33\npushed the woman out of the train and caught a train back to London in time to\nappear at the dinner.",
    "He could also have driven his car down that night moved\nthe body to the sarcophagus and driven back again.",
    "Make inquiries in the street\nwhere his garage is.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Do you think thats what he did do\nHow do I know asked Craddock.",
    "Hes a tall darkhaired man like the\none Miss Marples friend saw on the train.",
    "Now for Brother Alfred.",
    "Alfred Crackenthorpe had a flat in West Hampstead in a big modern\nbuilding.",
    "But the flat was small with just a table a single bed and some chairs.",
    "Craddock explained why he had come and asked Alfred what he had been doing\non the afternoon and evening of 20th December.",
    "Thats over three weeks ago.",
    "I never remember times or places.",
    "Except\nChristmas Day.",
    "Everyone knows where they were on Christmas Day and I was\nwith my father at Brackhampton.",
    "And this year your father was ill wasnt he\nYes.",
    "Caused by eating and drinking more than he was used to.",
    "But I heard that his doctor was  worried.",
    "Ah that stupid Quimper.",
    "Its no use listening to him.",
    "He seemed a rather sensible man to me.",
    "Well hes not.",
    "So when father felt ill Quimper was here all the time\nasking questions about everything hed eaten and drunk.",
    "The whole thing was\nmad\nCraddock didnt say anything so Alfred asked angrily Why do you want\nto know where I was on a particular Friday three or four weeks ago\nSo you do remember that it was a Friday\nI thought you said it was.",
    "Perhaps I did said Inspector Craddock.",
    "Anyway Friday 20th is the day I\nam asking about.",
    "Why Have you found out something more about the murdered woman\nOur information is not yet complete.",
    "Alfred gave him a sharp look.",
    "I hope you dont believe this mad theory of\nEmmas that she might have been Edmunds widow.",
    "Thats nonsense.",
    "Emma of\ncourse arranged a meeting with the woman.",
    "Very wise said Craddock.",
    "Was there a date fixed for this meeting\nIt was to be soon after Christmas  the weekend of the 27th... he stopped.",
    "Ah said Craddock pleasantly.",
    "So you do remember some dates.",
    "But you\ncant tell me what you were doing on Friday 20th December\nSorry  no.",
    "I probably just wandered around.",
    "Business gets done in bars\n\n\fmore than anywhere else.",
    "I cant tell you what I was doing that day but I can tell\nyou what I wasnt doing.",
    "I wasnt murdering anyone in the Long Barn.",
    "Why do you say that Mr Crackenthorpe\nCome on Inspector.",
    "Youre investigating this murder arent you Did\nsomebody see the dead woman going into the barn that afternoon She went in\nand she never came out Is that it\nThe sharp black eyes were watching him but Inspector Craddock said Im\nafraid well have to let you guess about that.",
    "The police are so secretive.",
    "Not only the police.",
    "I think Mr Crackenthorpe you could remember what\nyou were doing on that Friday if you tried.",
    "Of course you may have reasons for\nnot wishing to remember.",
    "The inspecter got up.",
    "Im sorry you couldnt be more\nhelpful Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Im sorry too Its all so silly.",
    "Even if the body is the body of Edmunds\nwidow why would any of us wish to kill her Wed all have enjoyed making\nFather give her money and pay to send her son to a good school.",
    "Sir that chap Ive seen him before Sergeant Wetherall said.",
    "He was\ninvolved with Dicky Rogers and some of the so ho lot who stole jewellery.",
    "Of course Craddock realized why Alfreds face had seemed familiar.",
    "They\nhad all been small crimes and nothing had ever been proved.",
    "Do you think he did it sir\nI dont know.",
    "But it explains why he couldnt give himself an alibi.",
    "So you think hes all right\nNo ones all right just yet said Inspector Craddock.",
    "CHAPTER SIXTEEN\nWhen Craddock got to 4 Madison Road he found Lucy Eyelesbarrow with\nMiss Marple.",
    "Im not on duty this afternoon Miss Eyelesbarrow so Ive come to\nsee the true expert on murder\nMiss Marple looked at him and laughed.",
    "I told you Lucy Sir Henry\nClithering his godfather is a very old friend of mine.",
    "Yes and he described her as the best detective in the world.",
    "Not only\ncould she tell you what might have happened and even what actually did\nhappen But also why it happened.",
    "Miss Marples face was pink.",
    "Really...",
    "I just know a little perhaps about\nhuman nature... living you know in a village\nDo you feel that if you saw the person who had done the murder youd\nknow asked Lucy.",
    "Oh I wouldnt say that dear.",
    "All one can do is to observe people and see\nof whom they remind you.",
    "Like Cedric and the bank manager\nThe bank managers son dear.",
    "Mr Eade himself was far more like Harold a little too fond of money  the sort of man too who would do anything to avoid\nscandal.",
    "Craddock smiled.",
    "And who does Alfred remind you of\nMr Jenkins at the garage.",
    "He didnt exactly steal tools but he used to\nexchange a broken one for a good one.",
    "And Emma continued Miss Marple she\nreminds me of Geraldine Webb  always very quiet  and bossed around by her\nelderly mother.",
    "It was a great surprise when the mother died and Geraldine went\noff on holiday and came back married to a very nice lawyer.",
    "Lucy said What\nyou said about Emma marrying seemed to upset the brothers.",
    "Miss Marple nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "So like men  unable to see whats going on in\nfront of them.",
    "I dont think you noticed either.",
    "No Lucy replied.",
    "They both seemed to me...",
    "So old said Miss Marple.",
    "But Dr Quimper isnt much over forty.",
    "And\nEmma Crackenthorpe is under forty.",
    "The doctors wife died young having a\nbaby so I have heard.",
    "He must be lonely.",
    "Are we investigating crime or are we arranging a marriage asked Lucy.",
    "Miss Marple smiled.",
    "Im afraid I am rather romantic.",
    "And now you have\nfinished what you were doing for me at Rutherford Hall if you really want a\nholiday...\nAnd leave Rutherford Hall Never Im the complete detective now.",
    "Almost as bad as Alexander and James.",
    "They spend all their time looking for\nclues.",
    "They looked all through the rubbish bins yesterday.",
    "So if they come to\nyou Inspector with a bit of paper with Martine  if you value your life keep\naway from the Long Bam on it youll know that I felt so sorry for them that I\nhid it in the pigsty\nInspector Craddock looked at her.",
    "Miss Eyelesbarrow Id like your\nopinion on something.",
    "What does the family think about this Martine business\nTheyre all furious with Emma for going to you about it Lucy replied.",
    "And with Dr Quimper who encouraged her.",
    "Harold and Alfred think the letter\nwasnt really from Martine.",
    "Emma isnt sure.",
    "Cedric agrees with his brothers but\nhe doesnt think its as serious as they do.",
    "Bryan though seems sure that Martine\nwrote the letter.",
    "Why I wonder\nWell Bryan just accepts things without question.",
    "Hes rather sweet like a\ndog that wants to be taken for a walk.",
    "And do you take him for a walk dear asked Miss Marple.",
    "To the\npigsties perhaps\nLucy looked at her sharply.",
    "Youre such a good looking girl I expect all the gentlemen give you a lot\nof attention.",
    "Gentlemen are all very much alike in some ways  even if they are\nquite old...\nYou are extraordinary said Lucy.",
    "How do you know these things But I\ndont think its my good looks  they must think I know something.",
    "She laughed.",
    "But Inspector Craddock did not laugh.",
    "Be careful.",
    "They might murder you\ninstead of asking you to marry them.",
    "Lucy was suddenly serious.",
    "I keep forgetting what happened.",
    "The boys\nhave been having such fun that I began to think of it all as a game.",
    "But its not a\ngame.",
    "No said Miss Marple.",
    "Murder isnt a game.",
    "She paused.",
    "Will the boys\ngo back to school soon\nYes next week.",
    "Tomorrow they go to Jamess home for the last few days\nof the holidays.",
    "Im glad of that said Miss Marple.",
    "I would not like anything to happen\nwhile they are at Rutherford Hall.",
    "Craddock looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "You dont believe that an unknown\nwoman was murdered by an unknown man You think that the crime was\nconnected to Rutherford Hall\nI think theres a definite connection yes.",
    "All we know about the murderer is that hes a tall dark man.",
    "On the day of\nthe inquest when I came out the three brothers were standing waiting for the\ncar.",
    "I could only see their backs not their faces and it was remarkable how in\ntheir heavy overcoats they looked all alike.",
    "Three tall dark men.",
    "And yet\nactually theyre all quite different.",
    "It makes it very difficult.",
    "I wonder said Miss Marple.",
    "Whether it might perhaps be all much\nsimpler than we think.",
    "Murders so often are simple  with an obvious unpleasant\nmotive...",
    "If Martine exists said Craddock there is a motive.",
    "Her reappearance with\na son would make the Crackenthorpe inheritance smaller  theyre all very short\nof money.",
    "Even Harold asked Lucy.",
    "Hes been involved in some rather risky deals.",
    "A large sum of money\nsoon might save him.",
    "But if so... said Lucy and stopped.",
    "I know dear said Miss Marple.",
    "Its the wrong murder thats what you\nmean.",
    "Yes.",
    "Martines death wouldnt help Harold  or any of the others.",
    "Not\nuntil...\nNot until Luther Crackenthorpe died.",
    "Exactly.",
    "And hell go on for years said Lucy.",
    "Although he was rather ill at\nChristmastime.",
    "He said the doctor made a lot of fuss about it Anyone would\n\n\fthink Id been poisoned by the fuss he made.",
    "Thats what he said.",
    "Yes said Craddock.",
    "I want to ask Dr Quimper about that.",
    "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nThe doctor looked very tired that evening as he offered Craddock a drink\nand poured one for himself as well.",
    "Well how can I help you\nFirst thank you for advising Miss Crackenthorpe to come to me with the\nletter that said it was from her brothers widow.",
    "Oh I didnt exactly advise her to come.",
    "She wanted to.",
    "Do you think it really was from Martine\nI dont know.",
    "I never saw it but I think it was probably from someone who\nknew the facts and was trying to get some money from the family.",
    "He paused.",
    "But why ask me Ive got nothing to do with it\nI really came to ask you something else...\nDr Quimper looked interested.",
    "I have heard that at Christmas Mr Crackenthorpe was suddenly rather ill\nwith a stomach upset.",
    "Yes.",
    "Mr Crackenthorpe mentioned you.",
    "Im sorry Doctor  he said you made a\nsilly fuss about it.",
    "Quimper smiled.",
    "He said you had asked him lots of questions not only\nabout what he had eaten but about who prepared it and served it.",
    "The doctor was not smiling now.",
    "Go on.",
    "He said you talked as though you believed someone had poisoned him.",
    "Did you believe that\nQuimper said Do you think a doctor can suggest that someone has been\npoisoned without any proof\nId just like to know if you suspected he had been poisoned.",
    "Dr Quimper said Old Crackenthorpe usually eats very little.",
    "When the\nfamily comes down Emma increases the amount of food.",
    "Result  gastroenteritis.",
    "So you were not at all  puzzled\nAll right.",
    "Yes I was puzzled Does that please you\nIt interests me said Craddock.",
    "Why were you puzzled\n\n\fBecause there were certain signs that were more like arsenic poisoning\nthan ordinary gastroenteritis.",
    "Although the two things are very much alike.",
    "And what was the result of your inquiries\nThat what I suspected could not possibly be true.",
    "Mr Crackenthorpe told\nme that he had had similar upsets before I had been his doctor and always when\nhe had eaten too much rich food.",
    "Which was when the house was full With the family Or guests\nYes.",
    "So I wrote to Dr Morris.",
    "He was my older partner who stopped\nworking soon after I joined him.",
    "I asked about the earlier upsets that Mr\nCrackenthorpe had bad.",
    "And what did he say\nQuimper smiled.",
    "He told me not to be so silly.",
    "I wonder.",
    "Crackenthorpe is a healthy old man do you think he might live\nto be ninety\nEasily.",
    "And his sons  and daughter  are all getting older too and they all need\nmoney\nYou leave Emma out of it.",
    "Shes no poisoner.",
    "These upsets only happen\nwhen the others are there  not when she and he are alone.",
    "Very wise of her if she was the poisoner the Inspector thought but did not\nsay so.",
    "He paused.",
    "But suppose arsenic was put in his food hasnt\nCrackenthorpe been very lucky not to die\nWell yes said the doctor.",
    "Its obviously not a case of small amounts of\narsenic given regularly  which is the usual method of arsenic poisoning.",
    "So if\nthese upsets are not from natural causes it looks as though the poisoner is\ngetting it wrong every time.",
    "Why hasnt he increased the amount It doesnt\nmake sense.",
    "I agree the Inspector said.",
    "It doesnt seem to make sense.",
    "Inspector Craddock\nThe excited whisper made him jump.",
    "Craddock had just been going to ring\nthe frontdoor bell when Alexander and Stoddart West appeared from the\nshadows.",
    "Weve found a clue Alexander said.",
    "Come with us.",
    "A little unwillingly he followed them round the corner of Rutherford Hall\nand into a yard where StoddartWest pushed open a heavy door.",
    "It really is a clue sir said StoddartWest his eyes shining behind his\nspectacles.",
    "We found it this afternoon.",
    "You see that big rubbish bin said Alexander.",
    "Hillman keeps it full of\nwaste paper for when the boiler goes out and he wants to start it again.",
    "Any odd paper thats blowing about.",
    "He picks it up and puts it in there...\nAnd thats where we found it...\nFound WHAT Craddock interrupted.",
    "The clue.",
    "Show him James.",
    "StoddartWest took from his pocket an envelope which he handed to the\nInspector.",
    "The due had been through the post there was no letter inside it was just a\ntorn envelope  addressed to Mrs Martine Crackenthorpe 126 Elvers Crescent\nN10.",
    "You see said Alexander.",
    "It shows she was here  Uncle Edmunds French\nwife...\nStoddartWest interrupted.",
    "Dont you think sir that it must have been her\nin the sarcophagus\nYoull test it for fingerprints wont you sir\nOf course said Craddock.",
    "Good luck for us wasnt it  StoddartWest said.",
    "On our last day too.",
    "Im going to Jamess place tomorrow said Alexander.",
    "His parents have\ngot a beautiful house  built in the time of Queen Anne wasnt it\nWilliam and Mary.",
    "I thought your mother said...\nMums French said StoddartWest.",
    "She doesnt really know about\nEnglish houses.",
    "Craddock was examining the envelope.",
    "How clever of Lucy Eyelesbarrow\nto put a post mark on it.",
    "Great fun for the boys.",
    "Come on he said Youve been\n\n\fvery helpful.",
    "CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\nThe boys led Craddock through the back door into the house.",
    "In the\nkitchen Lucy was rolling out pastry.",
    "Leaning against the wall was Bryan Eastley.",
    "Hello Dad said Alexander kindly.",
    "You out here again\nI like it out here said Bryan.",
    "Have you come to inspect the kitchen\nInspector\nNot exactly.",
    "Id like to speak to Mr Cedric Crackenthorpe.",
    "Ill go and see if hes in said Bryan and left the room.",
    "Is it nearly suppertime asked Alexander.",
    "No said Lucy.",
    "Theres some chocolate cake in the food cupboard.",
    "The boys rushed together out of the door.",
    "You are very clever said Craddock.",
    "Why\nBecause of how you did this He showed her the envelope.",
    "What are you talking about She looked at him.",
    "Craddock suddenly felt a bit faint.",
    "Didnt you put this in the bin for the\nboys to find\nWhat Do you mean that...\nCraddock put the envelope quickly back in his pocket as Bryan returned.",
    "Cedrics in the library.",
    "Cedric seemed delighted to see the Inspector.",
    "So have you found out who\nthe dead woman was\nWe have a good idea.",
    "But we want to get some statements.",
    "I would like\nyou to tell me exactly what you were doing on Friday 20th December.",
    "Cedric leaned back.",
    "Well as Ive already told you I was in Ibiza and one\nday there is so like another.",
    "Painting in the morning sleep in the afternoon.",
    "After\nthat some kind of a meal.",
    "Most of the evening in Scottys Bar with friends.",
    "Will\nthat do\nId rather have the truth Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Cedric sat up.",
    "Thats a most offensive remark Inspector.",
    "Really You told me that you left Ibiza on 21st December and arrived in\nEngland that same day\nYes I did.",
    "You must think we are very stupid said Craddock pleasantly.",
    "If youll\nshow me your passport I cant find it said Cedric.",
    "I think you could find it but its not really necessary because the records\nshow that you entered this country on the evening of 19th December.",
    "Perhaps\nyou will now tell me what you did between that time until lunchtime on 21st\nDecember when you arrived here.",
    "Cedric looked very angry.",
    "You cant do anything you want to anymore\nSomebodys always asking questions.",
    "And whats special about the 20th\nIt is the day we believe the murder was committed.",
    "Well yes Cedric said.",
    "I left Ibiza on the 19th.",
    "There was a very attractive\nwoman on the plane... we got to London and stayed at the Kingsway Palace in\ncase your spies havent found that out yet I called myself John Brown.",
    "And on the 20th\nI stayed in bed all morning as Id had rather a lot to drink.",
    "And the afternoon\nI went into the National Gallery.",
    "Then I saw a film.",
    "Then I had a drink or\ntwo in the bar and at about ten oclock I went out with the girlfriend to various\nnightclubs  cant remember much more till I woke up the next morning  when\nthe girlfriend ran off to catch her plane to America and I poured cold water over\nmy head and then left for this place.",
    "Can any of this be proved Mr Crackenthorpe Say between 3 p.m. and 7\np.m.",
    "Most unlikely said Cedric cheerfully.",
    "The door opened and Emma entered the room with a diary in her hand.",
    "I\nbelieve you want to know what everyone was doing on 20th December\nInspector Craddock\nEr  yes Miss Crackenthorpe.",
    "Well I went into Brackhampton for a church meeting.",
    "That finished about\na quarter to one and I lunched with Lady Adington and Miss Bartlett at the\n\n\fCadena Cafe.",
    "After lunch I did some Christmas shopping.",
    "I had tea at about a\nquarter to five in the Shamrock Tea Rooms and then went to the station to meet\nBryan.",
    "Thank you Miss Crackenthorpe that is very helpful.",
    "Craddock did not\ntell her that as she was a woman height five foot seven her movements were not\nimportant.",
    "Instead he said Your other two brothers came down later\nAlfred came down late on Saturday evening.",
    "He says he tried to phone me\nthat afternoon but I was out.",
    "Harold did not come down until Christmas Eve.",
    "Craddock took the envelope from his pocket.",
    "Do you recognize this\nBut... Emma looked at him shocked.",
    "Thats the letter I wrote to Martine.",
    "Did she... Have you found her\nIt is possible that we have  found her.",
    "This empty envelope was found\nhere.",
    "Then  it was Martine  in the sarcophagus\nIt seems very likely said Craddock gently.",
    "It seemed even more likely when he got back to town and found a message\nfrom Armand Dessin.",
    "One of her friends has had a postcard from Anna Stravinska.",
    "The holiday\nstory was true She has reached Jamaica and is having a wonderful time\nCraddock crushed the message and threw it into the wastepaper basket.",
    "CHAPTER NINTEEN\nNot very helpful said Sergeant Wetherall.",
    "Craddock was reading through the report on Harold Crackenthorpes alibi\nfor 20th December.",
    "He had been noticed at Sothebys at about threethirty but had left soon\nafter that.",
    "His photograph had not been recognized at Russells teashop but his\nmanservant said that he had returned to Cardigan Gardens to dress for his dinner\nparty at a quarter to seven  rather late since the dinner was at seventhirty.",
    "He\ndid not remember hearing him come in that evening but he often did not hear\nhim.",
    "The garage where Harold kept his car was rented and so no one noticed\nwho came and went there.",
    "He was at the Catering Club Dinner but left before the end of the\nspeeches.",
    "said Wetherall.",
    "Craddock stretched out his hand for the information on Cedric.",
    "That also\nwas negative though a taxi driver said he might have taken him to Paddington\nstation that afternoon.",
    "Dirty trousers and untidy hair.",
    "He swore a bit because\nfares had gone up since he was last in England.",
    "And heres Alfred said the Sergeant.",
    "Something in his voice made Craddock look up.",
    "Wetherall had the pleased\nlook of a man who has kept the best news until the end.",
    "The check was mainly negative.",
    "Alfred came and went at different times.",
    "Most of his neighbours were out at work all day.",
    "But towards the end of the\nreport Wetheralls large finger pointed to the final words.",
    "Sergeant Leakie who had been working on cases of things stolen from\nlorries had been at a cafe on the Waddington Brackhampton Road watching\ncertain lorry drivers.",
    "He had noticed at a nearby table Chick Evans one of the\nDicky Rogers mob.",
    "With him had been Alfred Crackenthorpe.",
    "Time 9.30 p.m.\nFriday 20th December.",
    "Alfred Crackenthorpe had got on a bus a few minutes later going in the\ndirection of Brackhampton.",
    "William Baker ticket collector at Brackhampton\nhad checked the ticket of a gentleman whom he recognized as one of Miss\nCrackenthorpes brothers just before the 11.55 train left for Paddington.",
    "He\nremembered the day because there had been a story of some mad old lady who\nsaid she had seen somebody murdered in a train that afternoon.",
    "It puts him right at the exact place there Wetherall said.",
    "Craddock nodded.",
    "Yes Alfred could have travelled down by the 4.33 to\nBrackhampton committing murder on the way.",
    "Then he could have gone out by\nbus to the cafe.",
    "He could have left there at ninethirty and would have had plenty\nof time to go to Rutherford Hall move the body from the embankment to the\nsarcophagus and get into Brackhampton in time to catch the 11.55 back to\nLondon.",
    "At Rutherford Hall there had been a gathering of the Crackenthorpe family\nand very soon voices were raised.",
    "Lucy decided to mix some cocktails in a jug and then took them towards\nthe library.",
    "The voices sounded clearly in the hall.",
    "Dr Quimper came out of the study where he had been with Mr\nCrackenthorpe.",
    "He saw the jug in Lucys hand.",
    "Whats this A celebration\nMore like a calming medicine.",
    "Theyre having a big argument in there.",
    "Blaming each other\nMostly Emma.",
    "Are they Dr Quimper took the jug from Lucys hand opened the library\ndoor and went in.",
    "Good evening.",
    "Ah Dr Quimper Harold said.",
    "I would like to know why you involved\nyourself in a family matter and told my sister to go to Scotland Yard about it.",
    "Dr Quimper said calmly Miss Crackenthorpe asked my advice.",
    "I gave it to\nher.",
    "You dare to...",
    "Girl Mr Crackenthorpe looked out of the study door just behind Lucy.",
    "I\nwant curry for dinner tonight.",
    "You make a very good curry.",
    "Its ages since weve\nhad curry.",
    "All right Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Lucy went back to the kitchen and began to peel some mushrooms.",
    "The\nfront door banged and from the window she saw Dr Quimper walk angrily to his\ncar and drive away.",
    "It was 3 a.m. when Dr Quimper drove his car into his garage.",
    "Well Mrs\nJosh Simpkins now had a healthy baby.",
    "He went upstairs to his bedroom.",
    "He was\n\n\ftired  very tired.",
    "He looked with pleasure at his bed.",
    "Then the telephone rang.",
    "Dr Quimper\nYes.",
    "This is Lucy Eyelesbarrow from Rutherford Hall.",
    "Please can you come\nover.",
    "Everybody here suddenly has an upset stomach.",
    "Ill be over immediately.",
    "He hurried down to his car again.",
    "It was three hours later when the doctor and Lucy sat down at the kitchen\ntable to drink large cups of black coffee.",
    "Well I think theyll be all right now he said.",
    "But how did it happen\nThats what I want to know.",
    "What did they have for dinner\nMushroom soup.",
    "Curried chicken and rice.",
    "Fruit jelly.",
    "All right  so most people would say It must have been the mushrooms.",
    "It wasnt the mushrooms.",
    "I had some of the soup myself and Im all right.",
    "Yes youre all right.",
    "If you mean...\nNo.",
    "Youre a clever girl.",
    "You would be pretending to be ill too if you had\nput poison in the food.",
    "Anyway I know all about you.",
    "I made some inquiries.",
    "And youre not a girlfriend of either Cedric Harold or Alfred  helping them to\ndo unpleasant things.",
    "Do you really think...",
    "I think quite a lot of things said Quimper.",
    "But I have to be careful what I\nsay.",
    "Now curried chicken.",
    "Did you have some of that\nNo.",
    "When youve cooked a curry the smell makes you feel youve already\neaten it.",
    "I tasted it of course.",
    "And I had some jelly.",
    "How did you serve the jelly\nIn separate glasses.",
    "And how much of all this has been washed up\nEverything.",
    "A pity Dr Quimper said.",
    "Is there any of the food left\nTheres some of the curry and some soup.",
    "No jelly.",
    "Ill take the curry and the soup.",
    "He stood up.",
    "And if you can manage until\nthe morning Ill send a nurse here by eight oclock.",
    "Dr Quimper put a hand on\nher shoulder.",
    "Look after two people in particular.",
    "Emma  well Emma means a\nlot to me.",
    "And look after the old man.",
    "I cant say that hes ever been my favourite\npatient but he is my patient and Im not going to let him be rushed out of the\nworld because one of his unpleasant sons wants his money.",
    "Inspector Bacon was looking upset.",
    "Arsenic he said.",
    "Arsenic\nYes.",
    "It was in the curry.",
    "So theres a poisoner at work\nIt seems so said Dr Quimper.",
    "And theyve all been ill you say  except that Miss Eyelesbarrow.",
    "Thats a\nbit strange...",
    "If Miss Eyelesbarrow was feeding the family arsenic she would be careful\nto eat a very small amount of the poisoned curry and then behave as though she\nwas extremely ill.\nAnd you wouldnt be able to tell that shed had less than the others\nProbably not.",
    "Then there might be one of the family now whos making more fuss than\nhe need\nYes.",
    "But I dont think that anyone has had enough arsenic to kill them.",
    "Did the poisoner make a mistake\nNo.",
    "I think that the idea was to put enough arsenic in the curry to cause\nsigns of food poisoning  which everyone would say was because of the\nmushrooms.",
    "Then one person would probably suddenly get worse and die.",
    "Because he had been given more poison\nThe doctor nodded.",
    "So perhaps you can go to Rutherford Hall and tell\nthem all that theyre suffering from arsenic poisoning.",
    "That will probably stop\nthe poisoner carrying out the rest of his plan.",
    "The telephone rang on the Inspectors desk.",
    "He picked it up.",
    "OK.",
    "Yes.",
    "He\nsaid to Quimper Its your nurse.",
    "He handed him the receiver.",
    "Quimper speaking...",
    "I see...",
    "Yes well be with you very soon.",
    "He put the\nreceiver down and turned to Bacon.",
    "Its Alfred.",
    "Hes dead.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY\nAlfred Craddock said over the phone.",
    "Alfred\nInspector Bacon said You didnt expect that\nNo not at all.",
    "In fact I thought he was the murderer There was a\nmoments silence.",
    "Then he asked There was a nurse in charge.",
    "How did she\nallow it to happen\nWe cant blame her.",
    "Miss Eyelesbarrow was very tired and went to bed for\na bit.",
    "The nurse had five patients to look after and old Mr Crackenthorpe started\nmaking a big fuss so she had to go and quieten him down and then took Alfred\nin some tea.",
    "He drank it and that was the end.",
    "Arsenic again\nIt seems so.",
    "I wonder said Craddock whether Alfred was meant to be the victim\nYou mean the tea might have been meant for the old man.",
    "Are they sure that the arsenic was in the tea\nNo.",
    "The nurse washed the cups and everything.",
    "But it seems the only\nlikely method.",
    "So said Craddock one of the patients wasnt as ill as the others Saw his\nchance and poisoned the cup\nWell there wont be any more of that said Inspector Bacon.",
    "Ive got two\nmen there.",
    "Are you coming down\nAs fast as I can\nLucy Eyelesbarrow came across the hall to meet the Inspector.",
    "She looked\npale.",
    "Youve been having a bad time said Craddock.",
    "Its been like a bad dream.",
    "About this curry\nIt was the curry\nYes arsenic was found in it.",
    "Then it must be one of the family who did it.",
    "There is no other possibility\nNo you see I only started making the curry late  after six oclock because Mr Crackenthorpe specially asked for curry.",
    "Which of them had the chance to do something to the curry while it was\ncooking\nLucy thought.",
    "Anyone could have come into the kitchen while I was\nlaying the table in the dining room.",
    "So who was here in the house Mr Crackenthorpe Emma Cedric...\nHarold and Alfred.",
    "Oh and Bryan Eastley.",
    "But he left just before dinner.",
    "Well look after yourself said Craddock.",
    "Theres a poisoner in this house\nremember and one of your patients probably isnt as ill as he pretends to be.",
    "Lucy went upstairs again after Craddock had gone and as she passed Mr\nCrackenthorpes room she heard him calling Girl  girl  come here.",
    "Lucy entered the room.",
    "Mr Crackenthorpe was sitting up in bed looking very cheerful.",
    "So Alfred\nwont get any of the money.",
    "Theyve all been waiting for me to die  Alfred in\nparticular.",
    "Now hes dead.",
    "Thats rather a good joke.",
    "He laughed.",
    "Ill outlive\nthem all.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY ONE\nLucy was busy arranging trays to take to the various sick people.",
    "She\npicked up the first one and took it upstairs.",
    "Whats this said Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Tea and rice pudding said Lucy.",
    "Take it away.",
    "I told that nurse I wanted meat.",
    "Whats Emma doing Why\ndoesnt she come and see me\nShes still in bed Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Women are so weak.",
    "But youre a good strong girl.",
    "And Ive got a nice\nstore of money and I know who Im going to spend it on when the time comes.",
    "He smiled and tried to hold her hand.",
    "Lucy went rather quickly out of the room.",
    "The next tray she took in to Emma.",
    "Oh thank you Lucy.",
    "But Im worried about your aunt she said as Lucy\nput the tray on her knees.",
    "You havent had any time to go and see her.",
    "Oh dont worry.",
    "She understands how difficult things have been.",
    "But as she went down to fetch the next tray Lucy decided that she would\nring Miss Marple up as soon as she had taken Cedric his meal.",
    "Cedric was sitting up in bed writing.",
    "Hello Lucy what awful food have\nyou got for me today I wish you would get rid of that nurse.",
    "She calls me we\nfor some reason.",
    "And how are we this morning Have we slept well\nYou seem very cheerful said Lucy.",
    "And busy.",
    "What are you writing\nPlans for what to do with this place when the old man dies.",
    "If I sell all the\nland Ill have more money than I know what to do with.",
    "I thought you disliked money.",
    "Of course I dislike money when I havent got any said Cedric.",
    "What a\nlovely girl you are Lucy or do I just think so because I havent seen any good\nlooking women for such a long time\nI expect thats it said Lucy.",
    "Before getting her own lunch she went to the telephone and rang up Miss\nMarple.",
    "Im very sorry I havent been able to come over but Ive been so busy.",
    "Of course my dear but theres nothing that can be done just now.",
    "And\nElspeth McGillicuddy will be home very soon.",
    "I wrote to her to come at once.",
    "You dont think... Lucy stopped.",
    "That there will be any more deaths Oh I hope not.",
    "But one never knows\ndoes one When someone is really evil.",
    "I mean.",
    "Lucy rang off and took her tray into the small study.",
    "She was just finishing\nher meal when the door opened and Bryan Eastley came in.",
    "Hello she said.",
    "This is very unexpected.",
    "I suppose it is said Bryan.",
    "How is everybody\nOh much better.",
    "Harolds going back to London tomorrow.",
    "Have you\ncome to stay\nWell Id like to if it wont be too much work for you.",
    "No we can manage said Lucy picking up the tray.",
    "Ill do that said Bryan taking it from her.",
    "They went into the kitchen\ntogether.",
    "Shall I help you wash up I do like this kitchen.",
    "In fact I like this\nwhole house.",
    "He picked up a cloth and began to wipe the spoons and forks.",
    "It\nseems a waste it all going to Cedric.",
    "Hell just sell it and go abroad again.",
    "Harold wouldnt want this house either and of course its much too big for\nEmma.",
    "But if it came to Alexander he and I would be as happy together here as\ntwo children.",
    "But before Alexander could get this place all of them would have\nto die and thats not likely is it\n\n\fCHAPTER TWENTY TWO\nThe next day when Lucy heard the doorbell ring she went to answer it\nexpecting to see the doctor.",
    "But it was not the doctor.",
    "On the doorstep stood a\ntall stylish woman.",
    "In the drive was a Rolls Royce.",
    "Can I see Miss Emma Crackenthorpe please It was a pleasant voice\nFrench perhaps.",
    "Im sorry Miss Crackenthorpe is ill and cant see anyone.",
    "I know she has been ill yes but it is very important that I see her.",
    "You are\nMiss Eyelesbarrow I think.",
    "My son has told me about you.",
    "I am Lady StoddartWest.",
    "Oh I see said Lucy.",
    "Lady StoddartWest continued I need to speak to Emma because of\nsomething that the boys have said to me.",
    "Please will you ask her\nCome in.",
    "Lucy took her visitor into the sitting room then she went\nupstairs knocked on Emmas door.",
    "Lady Stoddart West is here.",
    "She wants to\nsee you about something the boys have told her.",
    "Oh.",
    "Well... perhaps I ought to see her.",
    "Lucy led the visitor upstairs opened the bedroom door for her to go in and\nthen shut it.",
    "Lady StoddartWest moved across the room.",
    "Miss Crackenthorpe We\nhave met before I think at the sports day at the school.",
    "Yes said Emma Please sit down.",
    "Lady StoddartWest sat in a chair beside the bed.",
    "You must think it very\nstrange of me to come like this but the boys have been very excited about the\nmurder that happened here.",
    "Emma said You think we ought to have sent your son home earlier\nNo no that is not what I think.",
    "Oh this is difficult for me But the boys\ntold me that the police think that the murdered woman may be a French girl\nwhom your eldest brother knew during the war.",
    "Is that right\nIt is possible said Emma.",
    "But why do they think that she is Martine Did she have letters with her\n\n\fNo.",
    "But you see I had a letter from this Martine.",
    "You had a letter  from Martine\nYes saying she would like to come and see me.",
    "I invited her here but got\na message saying she was going back to France.",
    "But then an envelope was found\nhere addressed to her so...\nLady StoddartWest said quickly When I heard this I had to come and tell\nyou something that I never intended to tell you.",
    "You see I am Martine Dubois.",
    "Emma stared at her.",
    "You You are Martine\nBut yes.",
    "I met your brother Edmund in the first days of the war.",
    "He was\nstaying at our house.",
    "We fell in love.",
    "We intended to be married and then\nEdmund was killed.",
    "I will not speak to you of that time.",
    "But I will say to you that\nI loved your brother very much... Then the Germans occupied France and I\nhelped Englishmen get from France to England.",
    "That was how I met my present\nhusband.",
    "He was an Air Force officer.",
    "When the war was over I had a new life\nand did not want to think about the past.",
    "She paused.",
    "But it gave me a strange\npleasure when I found out that my sons best friend at his school was Edmunds\nnephew.",
    "I can hardly believe it said Emma that you are the Martine that dear\nEdmund told me about.",
    "But was it you then who wrote to me\nLady StoddartWest shook her head.",
    "No no of course I did not write to\nyou.",
    "Then... Emma stopped.",
    "Then there was someone pretending to be Martine who wanted perhaps to\nget money from you But who can it be I have never said anything about it\nsince I came to England.",
    "Emma said We will have to tell Inspector Craddock.",
    "She looked with suddenly gentle eyes at her visitor.",
    "Im so glad to know you at\nlast my dear.",
    "And I you.",
    "Emma leaned back.",
    "Thank goodness I dont know who the poor woman\nwas but if she wasnt Martine then she cant be connected to us\n\n\fCHAPTER TWENTY THREE\nThe neat secretary brought Harold Crackenthorpe his usual afternoon cup\nof tea.",
    "Thanks Miss Ellis I shall be going home early today.",
    "I dont really think you should have come in at all Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "You\ndont look well.",
    "Im all right said Harold but he did not feel well.",
    "He shouldnt really have come into the office but he had wanted to see\nhow the business was going.",
    "All this  he looked round him  appeared\nsuccessful.",
    "But now it wouldnt be long before his business failed.",
    "If only his\nfather had died instead of Alfred there wouldnt have been anything to worry\nabout.",
    "But with Alfred gone the money from his grandfather would be divided\nnot into five shares but into four.",
    "Looking more cheerful Harold got up left the\noffice and drove home.",
    "Darwin his servant opened the door.",
    "Her ladyship has just arrived sir.",
    "For a moment Harold stared at him.",
    "Alice Was it really today that Alice\nwas coming back from the Riviera He had forgotten all about it.",
    "He had never been in love with her of course but her rich family had been\nuseful.",
    "Though not perhaps as useful as they might have been because he and\nAlice had never had any children.",
    "He went upstairs into the sitting room.",
    "My dear how was San Raphael\nAlice told him how San Raphael was.",
    "She was a thin woman with sandycoloured hair and pale grey eyes.",
    "She also asked about her husbands health.",
    "Emmas telegram rather frightened me.",
    "I read in the paper the other day of forty\npeople in a hotel getting food poisoning.",
    "All these refrigerators are dangerous.",
    "People keep things in them too long and forget about them.",
    "Possibly said Harold.",
    "Oh and I nearly forgot to tell you theres a parcel for you on the hall table.",
    "Is there I didnt notice it.",
    "Harold went and picked up the parcel which\nwas small and very carefully wrapped.",
    "He took it back into the sitting room\nwhere he opened it.",
    "Inside was a small pill box with Two to be taken each night\n\n\fwritten on it.",
    "With it was a small piece of paper from the chemists in\nBrackhampton with Sent by request of Doctor Quimper written on it.",
    "What is it dear said Alice.",
    "You look worried.",
    "Oh its just  some pills.",
    "But Im sure the doctor said I need not take any\nmore.",
    "His wife said calmly He probably said dont forget to take them.",
    "Perhaps he did.",
    "Harold looked across at her and for a moment he\nwondered exactly what she was thinking.",
    "That calm expression told him nothing.",
    "Her eyes were like windows in an empty house.",
    "What did Alice feel about him\nHad she ever been in love with him\nI think I shall go to bed he said.",
    "Its been my first day back in the City.",
    "Yes I think thats a good idea.",
    "And dont forget to take your pills dear.",
    "He went upstairs.",
    "Yes it would be wrong to stop taking the pills so soon.",
    "He took two and swallowed them with a glass of water.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR\nNobody could possibly have made more mistakes than I have.",
    "Dermot\nCraddock sat in Florences sitting room looking tired and upset.",
    "Ive let a whole\nfamily be poisoned.",
    "Alfred Crackenthorpes dead and now Harolds dead too.",
    "What going on here\nPoisoned pills said Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "Yes.",
    "Very clever.",
    "They looked just like the pills that he had been taking.",
    "But Quimper never ordered them.",
    "And the chemist knew nothing about them\neither.",
    "No.",
    "That box of pills came from Rutherford Hall.",
    "Do you know it came from Rutherford Hall\nYes.",
    "Its the box that held Emmas sleeping pills.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Emmas...",
    "Yes.",
    "Its got her fingerprints on it and the fingerprints of both the nurses\nand the fingerprints of the chemist.",
    "Nobody elses of course.",
    "And the sleeping pills were removed and something else put in the box\nYes.",
    "What were the pills Harold took Miss Marple asked.",
    "Aconite.",
    "They are\nusually kept in a poison bottle.",
    "I dont know who poisoned Harold I dont know\nwho poisoned Alfred and now the real Martine turns out to be the wife of Sir\nRobert StoddartWest So whos the woman in the barn I dont know.",
    "At first I\nwas sure it was Anna Stravinska but then shes out of it Miss Marple gave a\nsmall cough.",
    "But is she\nWell that postcard from Jamaica...",
    "Yes said Miss Marple but anyone can get a postcard sent from almost\nanywhere dont you think\nYes said Craddock.",
    "And of course we would have checked that postcard\nif it hadnt been for the Martine business fitting in so well.",
    "The envelope of the\nletter Emma wrote to her was even found at Rutherford Hall showing she had\nactually been there.",
    "But the murdered woman hadnt been there Miss Marple said.",
    "Not in the\nsense you mean.",
    "She only came to Rutherford Hall after she was dead.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "What the envelope really proves is that the murderer was there.",
    "Presumably he took that envelope off her with her other things and then dropped\nit by mistake  or  I wonder was it a mistake Your men must have searched the\nplace but they didnt find it.",
    "It only turned up later in the bin.",
    "You think the boys were meant to find it\nWell it stopped you thinking about Anna Stravinska any more didnt it\nBut the main fact is that someone was going to pretend to be Martine said\nCraddock.",
    "And then for some reason  didnt.",
    "Why\nThats a very interesting question said Miss Marple.",
    "Somebody sent a note saying Martine was going back to France then\narranged to travel down with the girl and kill her on the way.",
    "You agree\nNot exactly said Miss Marple.",
    "I dont think really youre making it\nsimple enough.",
    "Simple So do you or do you not think you know who the murdered\nwoman was\nIts so difficult to explain Miss Marple said.",
    "I mean I dont know who\nshe was but Im sure who she was if you know what I mean.",
    "Know what you mean Craddock shook his head.",
    "I havent any idea.",
    "He\nlooked out through the window.",
    "Theres Lucy Eyelesbarrow coming to see you\nso Ill go.",
    "My confidence is very low this afternoon and meeting such a clever\nyoung woman is too much for me.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE\nI suppose it was always sure to cause trouble said Lucy walking up and\ndown the room.",
    "A will leaving money to several people but saying that if when\nthe time came for it to be handed out there was only one person left he would\nget the lot.",
    "And yet  there was such a lot of money you would think it would be\nenough...",
    "The trouble is said Miss Marple that people always want more money.",
    "Some people.",
    "They dont start with wanting to commit murder they just start by\nwanting more than theyre going to have.",
    "But weve now had three murders and that only leaves two to inherit the\nmoney doesnt it\nYou mean Cedric and Emma said Miss Marple.",
    "Not Emma.",
    "Emma isnt a tall dark man.",
    "No.",
    "I mean Cedric and Bryan\nEastley.",
    "I never thought of Bryan because hes fair but the other day... She\npaused.",
    "Go on said Miss Marple.",
    "It was when Lady StoddartWest was leaving.",
    "She was getting into the car\nwhen she suddenly asked Who was that tall dark man who was standing on the\nlawn as I came in\nI didnt know who she meant at first because Cedric was still in bed.",
    "So I\nsaid You dont mean Bryan Eastley and she said Of course Squadron\nLeader Eastley.",
    "He was hidden in our house in France once during the war.",
    "I\nremembered the way he stood.",
    "Miss Marple said nothing.",
    "And then later I looked at him...",
    "He was standing with his back to me and\nI saw that even when a man is fair his hair can look dark if he smooths it down\nwith cream.",
    "So you see it might have been Bryan that your friend saw in the\ntrain.",
    "It might...",
    "Yes said Miss Marple.",
    "I had thought of that.",
    "But the money would go to Alexander not to him.",
    "If anything happened to Alexander before he was twenty one then Bryan\nwould get the money Miss Marple said.",
    "Lucy looked shocked.",
    "He would never do that.",
    "No father would ever do\nthat.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head.",
    "People do my dear.",
    "Its very sad and very\nawful but they do.",
    "She added gently But you mustnt worry.",
    "Elspeth\nMcGillicuddy will be here very soon now.",
    "I dont see how that will help.",
    "No dear perhaps not.",
    "But I think its important.",
    "Then with a quick look\nat Lucy she said Theres something else thats worrying you.",
    "Yes.",
    "Something that I didnt understand until two days ago.",
    "Bryan could in\nfact have been on that train.",
    "On the 4.33 from Paddington\nYes.",
    "You see Emma when talking about her movements on 20th\nDecember said she went to meet Bryan at the station.",
    "The train she met was the\n4.50 from Paddington but he could have been on the earlier train and pretended\nto come on the later one.",
    "It doesnt really prove anything.",
    "The awful thing is not\nknowing what happened.",
    "And perhaps we never will know\nOf course we will know dear said Miss Marple.",
    "The one thing I do know\nabout murderers is that they can never leave things alone.",
    "Particularly after\ntheyve committed a second murder.",
    "And the great thing is that Elspeth\nMcGillicuddy will be here very soon now\n\n\fCHAPTER TWENTY SIX\nNow Elspeth you do know what I want you to do\nYes I know said Mrs McGillicuddy but what I say to you is Jane that it\nseems very strange.",
    "Its not strange at all said Miss Marple.",
    "To arrive at the house and to ask almost immediately whether I can  er go upstairs\nIts very cold weather.",
    "If you would just tell me why I must go upstairs Jane.",
    "Thats just what I dont want to do said Miss Marple.",
    "How annoying you are.",
    "First you make me come all the way back to\nEngland before...\nIm sorry about that but someone may soon be killed.",
    "So you see Elspeth\nit was your duty to come back.",
    "And thats the taxi now she added as a sound\nwas heard outside the house.",
    "So Mrs McGillicuddy put on her coat and the two ladies were driven to\nRutherford Hall.",
    "Who can this be Emma asked looking out of the window as the taxi\nmoved past it.",
    "I do believe its Lucys old aunt.",
    "What a bore said Cedric.",
    "Tell her youre not at home.",
    "But at that moment the door was opened by Mrs Hart who was there that\nafternoon to clean the silver and Miss Marple came in with another woman\nbehind her.",
    "I do hope said Miss Marple taking Emmas hand that this is not\ninconvenient.",
    "But Im going home the day after tomorrow and so I wanted to say\ngoodbye... Oh may I introduce my friend Mrs McGillicuddy who is visiting\nAt this moment Lucy entered the room.",
    "Aunt Jane I had no idea...",
    "I had to come and thank Miss Crackenthorpe said Miss Marple who has\nbeen so very very kind to you Lucy.",
    "Its Lucy whos been very kind to us said Emma.",
    "Oh yes said Cedric.",
    "Weve certainly made her work for her money.",
    "Looking after us when we were ill running up and down the stairs...\nMiss Marple interrupted.",
    "So dangerous isnt it food poisoning\nMushrooms I heard.",
    "The cause remains rather mysterious said Emma.",
    "Nonsense said Cedric Arsenic in the curry thats what it was.",
    "Lucys\naunt knows all about it Im sure.",
    "Well said Miss Marple I did just hear...",
    "The door opened and Mr Crackenthorpe came in.",
    "Wheres tea You Girl\nWhy havent you brought tea in\nIts just ready Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "Lucy went out of the room then reappeared with a tea tray.",
    "Bryan Eastley\nfollowed her carrying sandwiches and cake.",
    "Whats this Whats this Mr Crackenthorpe asked.",
    "A decorated cake\nAre we having a party Nobody told me about it.",
    "Emmas face went pink.",
    "Dr Quimpers coming to tea Father.",
    "Its his\nbirthday today and...\nBirthday Birthdays are only for children.",
    "I wont let anyone celebrate my\nbirthdays.",
    "Emma what a delightful view you have from this window said Miss\nMarple moving across to it.",
    "Just like a picture with the cows there under the\ntrees.",
    "I cant believe that I am in the middle of a town.",
    "If the windows were open you would hear far off the noise of the traffic\nsaid Emma.",
    "Oh of course said Miss Marple theres noise everywhere isnt there\nEven in St Mary Mead.",
    "Really the way those jet planes fly over Two windows\nin my little greenhouse were broken the other day.",
    "I cant understand why.",
    "Its quite simple really said Bryan coming to the window.",
    "Miss Marple dropped her handbag and Bryan politely picked it up.",
    "At the\nsame moment Mrs McGillicuddy said to Emma I wonder  could I go upstairs\nfor a moment\nIll take you said Lucy and they left the room together.",
    "It is very cold outside today said Miss Marple.",
    "About planes breaking windows said Bryan.",
    "Oh look theres Quimper.",
    "The doctor drove up in his car.",
    "He came in rubbing his hands.",
    "Its going to\nsnow I think.",
    "Hello Emma how are you Goodness whats all this\nYou told me today was your birthday said Emma.",
    "So we made you a\ncake.",
    "But its years since anyones remembered my birthday.",
    "He looked almost\nuncomfortably pleased.",
    "Come on lets have tea said Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "What are we waiting\nfor\nOh please said Miss Marple dont wait for my friend.",
    "She would be\nmost upset if you did.",
    "They sat down and started tea.",
    "Miss Marple reached for a sandwich then\npaused.",
    "Are they\nFish said Bryan.",
    "I helped make them.",
    "Mr Crackenthorpe laughed.",
    "Poisoned fish.",
    "Thats what they are.",
    "Youve\ngot to be careful what you eat in this house Miss Marple.",
    "Dont let him stop you said Cedric.",
    "A bit of arsenic is good for the skin\nthey say if you dont have too much.",
    "Eat one yourself boy said Mr Crackenthorpe.",
    "All right said Cedric.",
    "He took a sandwich and put it whole into his\nmouth.",
    "Miss Marple also took a sandwich and bit into it.",
    "I do think its so brave of\nyou all to make these jokes.",
    "Then suddenly she began to choke.",
    "A fish bone in\nmy throat.",
    "Quimper got up quickly.",
    "He went across to her moved her backwards\ntowards the window and told her to open her mouth.",
    "Then he looked down into\nthe old ladys throat.",
    "At that moment the door opened and Mrs McGillicuddy\nfollowed by Lucy came in.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy stopped as she saw the scene in\nfront of her Miss Marple leaning back and the doctor holding her throat.",
    "But thats him she cried.",
    "Thats the man in the train...\nWith unbelievable speed Miss Marple escaped from the doctors hands and\n\n\fcame towards her friend.",
    "I thought youd recognize him Elspeth No.",
    "Dont say another word.",
    "She\nturned to Dr Quimper.",
    "You didnt know did you Doctor when you strangled\nthat woman in the train that somebody actually saw you do it It was my friend\nhere.",
    "She was in another train that was running parallel with yours.",
    "What Dr Quimper moved quickly towards Mrs McGillicuddy but again\nwith unbelievable speed Miss Marple was between them.",
    "Yes.",
    "She saw you and she recognizes you and shell swear to it in court.",
    "You disgusting old Dr Quimper stepped towards Miss Marple but Cedric\ncaught him by the shoulder.",
    "So youre the murderer.",
    "I never liked you but I never suspected you.",
    "Bryan Eastley came quickly to help Cedric and at that moment Inspector\nCraddock and Inspector Bacon entered the room.",
    "Dr Quimper said Bacon I must caution you that...\nYou can do what you like with your caution.",
    "Do you really think anyones\ngoing to believe what a couple of old women say Dr Quimper suddenly\nlaughed.",
    "Why should I want to murder a totally strange woman\nShe wasnt a strange woman said Inspector Craddock.",
    "She was your wife\n\n\fCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN\nSo you see said Miss Marple it really was very very simple.",
    "So many\nmen seem to murder their wives.",
    "Mrs McGillicuddy looked at Miss Marple and Inspector Craddock.",
    "Please\nexplain it all to me.",
    "He saw his chance you see said Miss Marple of having a rich wife\nEmma Crackenthorpe.",
    "But he couldnt marry her because he had a wife already.",
    "They had been separated for years but she wouldnt divorce him.",
    "That fitted very\nwell with what Inspector Craddock told me of a girl called Anna Stravinska.",
    "She\nhad an English husband and she was a Catholic.",
    "So Dr Quimper decided to kill her.",
    "The idea of murdering her in the train\nand later putting her body in the sarcophagus was rather a clever one because it\nwould involve the Crackenthorpe family.",
    "Before that he had written a letter to\nEmma which said it was from Martine.",
    "Emma had told Dr Quimper all about her\nbrother you see.",
    "Then he encouraged her to go to the police with her story as he\nwanted the dead woman to be identified as Martine.",
    "I think he may have heard\nthat inquiries were being made by the Paris police about Anna Stravinska so he\narranged to have a postcard come from her from Jamaica.",
    "It was easy for him to meet his wife in London to tell her that he hoped\nthey could be together again and that he would like her to come and meet his\nfamily.",
    "We wont talk about the next part of it which is very unpleasant.",
    "Of\ncourse all he wanted was money so perhaps he had already thought about\nmurdering the brothers before he decided to murder his wife.",
    "Anyway he started\nthe idea that someone was trying to poison old Mr Crackenthorpe to prepare for\nhis other crimes.",
    "And then he gave arsenic to the whole family.",
    "Not too much of\ncourse because he didnt want old Mr Crackenthorpe to die.",
    "But I still dont see how he did that said Craddock.",
    "He wasnt in the\nhouse when the curry was being prepared.",
    "Oh but there wasnt any arsenic in the curry then said Miss Marple.",
    "He\nadded it to the curry afterwards when he took it away to be tested.",
    "He probably\nput the arsenic in the cocktail jug earlier.",
    "Then of course it was easy for him as\na doctor to poison Alfred Crackenthorpe and also to send the pills to Harold in\nLondon.",
    "Everything he did was planned and selfish and cruel.",
    "I agree said Inspector Craddock.",
    "But I thought continued Miss Marple that if Elspeth could see Dr\nQuimper in exactly the same position as she had seen him in the train with his\nback to her bent over a woman he was holding by the throat then she would\nrecognize him.",
    "That is why I had to prepare my little plan with Lucys help.",
    "I must say said Mrs McGillicuddy it did give me a shock.",
    "I said Thats\nhim before I could stop myself.",
    "Yet I hadnt in fact seen the mans face and...",
    "I was afraid that you were going to say so Elspeth said Miss Marple.",
    "And that would have been awful.",
    "Because he thought you really did recognize\nhim.",
    "I mean he couldnt know that you hadnt seen his face.",
    "A good thing I said nothing then said Mrs McGillicuddy.",
    "I wasnt going to let you say another word said Miss Marple.",
    "Craddock\nlaughed.",
    "So Miss Marple what is the happy ending What happens to poor\nEmma Crackenthorpe\nShell soon forget the doctor and perhaps go off on a holiday and meet\nsomeone else.",
    "A nicer man than Dr Quimper I hope.",
    "What about Lucy Eyelesbarrow A wedding there too\nPerhaps said Miss Marple.",
    "Which of all the men is she going to choose said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Dont you know said Miss Marple.",
    "No I dont said Craddock.",
    "Do you\nOh yes I think so said Miss Marple.",
    "And she smiled at him."
