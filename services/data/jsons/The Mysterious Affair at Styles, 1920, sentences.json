    "\nTitle The Mysterious Affair at Styles\n\nAuthor Agatha Christie\n\n\nThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\n\nby Agatha Christie\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\nI GO TO STYLES\n\n\nThe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\ntime as \u201cThe Styles Case\u201d has now somewhat subsided.",
    "Nevertheless in\nview of the worldwide notoriety which attended it I have been asked\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves to write an account\nof the whole story.",
    "This we trust will effectually silence the\nsensational rumours which still persist.",
    "I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\nbeing connected with the affair.",
    "I had been invalided home from the Front and after spending some\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home was given a month\u2019s\nsick leave.",
    "Having no near relations or friends I was trying to make\nup my mind what to do when I ran across John Cavendish.",
    "I had seen\nvery little of him for some years.",
    "Indeed I had never known him\nparticularly well.",
    "He was a good fifteen years my senior for one\nthing though he hardly looked his fortyfive years.",
    "As a boy though\nI had often stayed at Styles his mother\u2019s place in Essex.",
    "We had a good yarn about old times and it ended in his inviting me\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.",
    "\u201cThe mater will be delighted to see you again\u2014after all those years\u201d\nhe added.",
    "\u201cYour mother keeps well\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cOh yes.",
    "I suppose you know that she has married again\u201d\n\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish who\nhad married John\u2019s father when he was a widower with two sons had been\na handsome woman of middleage as I remembered her.",
    "She certainly could\nnot be a day less than seventy now.",
    "I recalled her as an energetic\nautocratic personality somewhat inclined to charitable and social\nnotoriety with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\nBountiful.",
    "She was a most generous woman and possessed a considerable\nfortune of her own.",
    "Their countryplace Styles Court had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\nearly in their married life.",
    "He had been completely under his wife\u2019s\nascendancy so much so that on dying he left the place to her for her\nlifetime as well as the larger part of his income an arrangement that\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons.",
    "Their stepmother however had\nalways been most generous to them indeed they were so young at the\ntime of their father\u2019s remarriage that they always thought of her as\ntheir own mother.",
    "Lawrence the younger had been a delicate youth.",
    "He had qualified as a\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine and lived at\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions though his verses never had any\nmarked success.",
    "John practised for some time as a barrister but had finally settled\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire.",
    "He had married two\nyears ago and had taken his wife to live at Styles though I\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\nto increase his allowance which would have enabled him to have a home\nof his own.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish however was a lady who liked to make her\nown plans and expected other people to fall in with them and in this\ncase she certainly had the whip hand namely the purse strings.",
    "John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother\u2019s remarriage and\nsmiled rather ruefully.",
    "\u201cRotten little bounder too\u201d he said savagely.",
    "\u201cI can tell you\nHastings it\u2019s making life jolly difficult for us.",
    "As for Evie\u2014you\nremember Evie\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I suppose she was after your time.",
    "She\u2019s the mater\u2019s factotum\ncompanion Jack of all trades A great sport\u2014old Evie Not precisely\nyoung and beautiful but as game as they make them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were going to say\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh this fellow He turned up from nowhere on the pretext of being a\nsecond cousin or something of Evie\u2019s though she didn\u2019t seem\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship.",
    "The fellow is an\nabsolute outsider anyone can see that.",
    "He\u2019s got a great black beard\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers But the mater cottoned\nto him at once took him on as secretary\u2014you know how she\u2019s always\nrunning a hundred societies\u201d\n\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cWell of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands.",
    "No\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her.",
    "But you could have knocked us\nall down with a feather when three months ago she suddenly announced\nthat she and Alfred were engaged The fellow must be at least twenty\nyears younger than she is It\u2019s simply barefaced fortune hunting but\nthere you are\u2014she is her own mistress and she\u2019s married him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be a difficult situation for you all.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifficult It\u2019s damnable\u201d\n\nThus it came about that three days later I descended from the train\nat Styles St. Mary an absurd little station with no apparent reason\nfor existence perched up in the midst of green fields and country\nlanes.",
    "John Cavendish was waiting on the platform and piloted me out\nto the car.",
    "\u201cGot a drop or two of petrol still you see\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cMainly\nowing to the mater\u2019s activities.\u201d\n\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\nlittle station and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it.",
    "It\nwas a still warm day in early July.",
    "As one looked out over the flat\nEssex country lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun it\nseemed almost impossible to believe that not so very far away a great\nwar was running its appointed course.",
    "I felt I had suddenly strayed\ninto another world.",
    "As we turned in at the lodge gates John said\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll find it very quiet down here Hastings.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow that\u2019s just what I want.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life.",
    "I drill\nwith the volunteers twice a week and lend a hand at the farms.",
    "My wife\nworks regularly \u2018on the land\u2019.",
    "She is up at five every morning to milk\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime.",
    "It\u2019s a jolly good life taking\nit all round\u2014if it weren\u2019t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp\u201d He\nchecked the car suddenly and glanced at his watch.",
    "\u201cI wonder if we\u2019ve\ntime to pick up Cynthia.",
    "No she\u2019ll have started from the hospital by\nnow.\u201d\n\n\u201cCynthia That\u2019s not your wife\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Cynthia is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of my mother\u2019s the daughter of an old\nschoolfellow of hers who married a rascally solicitor.",
    "He came a\ncropper and the girl was left an orphan and penniless.",
    "My mother came\nto the rescue and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now.",
    "She\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster seven miles away.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke the last words we drew up in front of the fine old house.",
    "A lady in a stout tweed skirt who was bending over a flower bed\nstraightened herself at our approach.",
    "\u201cHullo Evie here\u2019s our wounded hero Mr. Hastings\u2014Miss Howard.\u201d\n\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty almost painful grip.",
    "I had an\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face.",
    "She was a\npleasantlooking woman of about forty with a deep voice almost manly\nin its stentorian tones and had a large sensible square body with\nfeet to match\u2014these last encased in good thick boots.",
    "Her conversation\nI soon found was couched in the telegraphic style.",
    "\u201cWeeds grow like house afire.",
    "Can\u2019t keep even with \u2019em.",
    "Shall press you\nin.",
    "Better be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful\u201d I\nresponded.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t say it.",
    "Never does.",
    "Wish you hadn\u2019t later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cynic Evie\u201d said John laughing.",
    "\u201cWhere\u2019s tea today\u2014inside\nor out\u201d\n\n\u201cOut.",
    "Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on then you\u2019ve done enough gardening for today.",
    "\u2018The labourer\nis worthy of his hire\u2019 you know.",
    "Come and be refreshed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Miss Howard drawing off her gardening gloves \u201cI\u2019m\ninclined to agree with you.\u201d\n\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\nof a large sycamore.",
    "A figure rose from one of the basket chairs and came a few steps to\nmeet us.",
    "\u201cMy wife Hastings\u201d said John.",
    "I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish.",
    "Her tall\nslender form outlined against the bright light the vivid sense of\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\ntawny eyes of hers remarkable eyes different from any other woman\u2019s\nthat I have ever known the intense power of stillness she possessed\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\nan exquisitely civilised body\u2014all these things are burnt into my\nmemory.",
    "I shall never forget them.",
    "She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\nvoice and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\nhad accepted John\u2019s invitation.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea and\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\nthoroughly fascinating woman.",
    "An appreciative listener is always\nstimulating and I described in a humorous manner certain incidents\nof my Convalescent Home in a way which I flatter myself greatly\namused my hostess.",
    "John of course good fellow though he is could\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.",
    "At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\nwindow near at hand\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll write to the Princess after tea Alfred I\u2019ll write to\nLady Tadminster for the second day myself.",
    "Or shall we wait until we\nhear from the Princess In case of a refusal Lady Tadminster might\nopen it the first day and Mrs. Crosbie the second.",
    "Then there\u2019s the\nDuchess\u2014about the school f\u00eate.\u201d\n\nThere was the murmur of a man\u2019s voice and then Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s rose\nin reply\n\n\u201cYes certainly.",
    "After tea will do quite well.",
    "You are so thoughtful\nAlfred dear.\u201d\n\nThe French window swung open a little wider and a handsome\nwhitehaired old lady with a somewhat masterful cast of features\nstepped out of it on to the lawn.",
    "A man followed her a suggestion of\ndeference in his manner.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.",
    "\u201cWhy if it isn\u2019t too delightful to see you again Mr. Hastings after\nall these years.",
    "Alfred darling Mr. Hastings\u2014my husband.\u201d\n\nI looked with some curiosity at \u201cAlfred darling\u201d.",
    "He certainly struck a\nrather alien note.",
    "I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard.",
    "It\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen.",
    "He wore\ngoldrimmed pincenez and had a curious impassivity of feature.",
    "It\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage but was strangely out\nof place in real life.",
    "His voice was rather deep and unctuous.",
    "He\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said\n\n\u201cThis is a pleasure Mr. Hastings.\u201d Then turning to his wife \u201cEmily\ndearest I think that cushion is a little damp.\u201d\n\nShe beamed fondly on him as he substituted another with every\ndemonstration of the tenderest care.",
    "Strange infatuation of an\notherwise sensible woman\n\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp a sense of constraint and veiled\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company.",
    "Miss Howard in\nparticular took no pains to conceal her feelings.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp\nhowever seemed to notice nothing unusual.",
    "Her volubility which I\nremembered of old had lost nothing in the intervening years and she\npoured out a steady flood of conversation mainly on the subject of the\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\nshortly.",
    "Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\ndays or dates.",
    "His watchful and attentive manner never varied.",
    "From the\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him and I flatter\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.",
    "Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\nletters to Evelyn Howard and her husband addressed me in his\npainstaking voice\n\n\u201cIs soldiering your regular profession Mr. Hastings\u201d\n\n\u201cNo before the war I was in Lloyd\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you will return there after it is over\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps.",
    "Either that or a fresh start altogether.\u201d\n\nMary Cavendish leant forward.",
    "\u201cWhat would you really choose as a profession if you could just\nconsult your inclination\u201d\n\n\u201cWell that depends.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo secret hobby\u201d she asked.",
    "\u201cTell me\u2014you\u2019re drawn to something\nEveryone is\u2014usually something absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll laugh at me.\u201d\n\nShe smiled.",
    "\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real thing\u2014Scotland Yard Or Sherlock Holmes\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Sherlock Holmes by all means.",
    "But really seriously I am awfully\ndrawn to it.",
    "I came across a man in Belgium once a very famous\ndetective and he quite inflamed me.",
    "He was a marvellous little fellow.",
    "He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\nmethod.",
    "My system is based on his\u2014though of course I have progressed\nrather further.",
    "He was a funny little man a great dandy but\nwonderfully clever.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a good detective story myself\u201d remarked Miss Howard.",
    "\u201cLots of\nnonsense written though.",
    "Criminal discovered in last chapter.",
    "Everyone\ndumbfounded.",
    "Real crime\u2014you\u2019d know at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been a great number of undiscovered crimes\u201d I argued.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t mean the police but the people that are right in it.",
    "The\nfamily.",
    "You couldn\u2019t really hoodwink them.",
    "They\u2019d know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen\u201d I said much amused \u201cyou think that if you were mixed up in a\ncrime say a murder you\u2019d be able to spot the murderer right off\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I should.",
    "Mightn\u2019t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.",
    "But I\u2019m certain I\u2019d know.",
    "I\u2019d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\nme.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be a \u2018she\u2019\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cMight.",
    "But murder\u2019s a violent crime.",
    "Associate it more with a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in a case of poisoning.\u201d Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s clear voice startled me.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Bauerstein was saying yesterday that owing to the general\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy Mary what a gruesome conversation\u201d cried Mrs. Inglethorp.",
    "\u201cIt\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave.",
    "Oh there\u2019s\nCynthia\u201d\n\nA young girl in V.A.D.",
    "uniform ran lightly across the lawn.",
    "\u201cWhy Cynthia you are late today.",
    "This is Mr. Hastings\u2014Miss Murdoch.\u201d\n\nCynthia Murdoch was a freshlooking young creature full of life and\nvigour.",
    "She tossed off her little V.A.D.",
    "cap and I admired the great\nloose waves of her auburn hair and the smallness and whiteness of the\nhand she held out to claim her tea.",
    "With dark eyes and eyelashes she\nwould have been a beauty.",
    "She flung herself down on the ground beside John and as I handed her a\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.",
    "\u201cSit down here on the grass do.",
    "It\u2019s ever so much nicer.\u201d\n\nI dropped down obediently.",
    "\u201cYou work at Tadminster don\u2019t you Miss Murdoch\u201d\n\nShe nodded.",
    "\u201cFor my sins.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they bully you then\u201d I asked smiling.",
    "\u201cI should like to see them\u201d cried Cynthia with dignity.",
    "\u201cI have got a cousin who is nursing\u201d I remarked.",
    "\u201cAnd she is terrified\nof \u2018Sisters\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wonder.",
    "Sisters are you know Mr. Hastings.",
    "They simply\nare You\u2019ve no idea But I\u2019m not a nurse thank heaven I work in the\ndispensary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many people do you poison\u201d I asked smiling.",
    "Cynthia smiled too.",
    "\u201cOh hundreds\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cCynthia\u201d called Mrs. Inglethorp \u201cdo you think you could write a few\nnotes for me\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly Aunt Emily.\u201d\n\nShe jumped up promptly and something in her manner reminded me that\nher position was a dependent one and that Mrs. Inglethorp kind as she\nmight be in the main did not allow her to forget it.",
    "My hostess turned to me.",
    "\u201cJohn will show you your room.",
    "Supper is at halfpast seven.",
    "We have\ngiven up late dinner for some time now.",
    "Lady Tadminster our Member\u2019s\nwife\u2014she was the late Lord Abbotsbury\u2019s daughter\u2014does the same.",
    "She\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy.",
    "We are quite a\nwar household nothing is wasted here\u2014every scrap of waste paper even\nis saved and sent away in sacks.\u201d\n\nI expressed my appreciation and John took me into the house and up the\nbroad staircase which forked right and left halfway to different\nwings of the building.",
    "My room was in the left wing and looked out\nover the park.",
    "John left me and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch.",
    "I heard Mrs.\nInglethorp call \u201cCynthia\u201d impatiently and the girl started and ran\nback to the house.",
    "At the same moment a man stepped out from the\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction.",
    "He looked\nabout forty very dark with a melancholy cleanshaven face.",
    "Some\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him.",
    "He looked up at my window\nas he passed and I recognized him though he had changed much in the\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met.",
    "It was John\u2019s younger\nbrother Lawrence Cavendish.",
    "I wondered what it was that had brought\nthat singular expression to his face.",
    "Then I dismissed him from my mind and returned to the contemplation of\nmy own affairs.",
    "The evening passed pleasantly enough and I dreamed that night of that\nenigmatical woman Mary Cavendish.",
    "The next morning dawned bright and sunny and I was full of the\nanticipation of a delightful visit.",
    "I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunchtime when she volunteered to\ntake me for a walk and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\nwoods returning to the house about five.",
    "As we entered the large hall John beckoned us both into the\nsmokingroom.",
    "I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\noccurred.",
    "We followed him in and he shut the door after us.",
    "\u201cLook here Mary there\u2019s the deuce of a mess.",
    "Evie\u2019s had a row with\nAlfred Inglethorp and she\u2019s off.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvie Off\u201d\n\nJohn nodded gloomily.",
    "\u201cYes you see she went to the mater and\u2014Oh\u2014here\u2019s Evie herself.\u201d\n\nMiss Howard entered.",
    "Her lips were set grimly together and she carried\na small suitcase.",
    "She looked excited and determined and slightly on\nthe defensive.",
    "\u201cAt any rate\u201d she burst out \u201cI\u2019ve spoken my mind\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Evelyn\u201d cried Mrs. Cavendish \u201cthis can\u2019t be true\u201d\n\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.",
    "\u201cTrue enough Afraid I said some things to Emily she won\u2019t forget or\nforgive in a hurry.",
    "Don\u2019t mind if they\u2019ve only sunk in a bit.",
    "Probably\nwater off a duck\u2019s back though.",
    "I said right out \u2018You\u2019re an old\nwoman Emily and there\u2019s no fool like an old fool.",
    "The man\u2019s twenty\nyears younger than you and don\u2019t you fool yourself as to what he\nmarried you for.",
    "Money Well don\u2019t let him have too much of it.",
    "Farmer\nRaikes has got a very pretty young wife.",
    "Just ask your Alfred how much\ntime he spends over there.\u2019 She was very angry.",
    "Natural I went on\n\u2018I\u2019m going to warn you whether you like it or not.",
    "That man would as\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you.",
    "He\u2019s a bad lot.",
    "You can say\nwhat you like to me but remember what I\u2019ve told you.",
    "He\u2019s a bad lot\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she say\u201d\n\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.",
    "\u201c\u2018Darling Alfred\u2019\u2014\u2018dearest Alfred\u2019\u2014\u2018wicked calumnies\u2019 \u2014\u2018wicked\nlies\u2019\u2014\u2018wicked woman\u2019\u2014to accuse her \u2018dear husband\u2019 The sooner I left\nher house the better.",
    "So I\u2019m off.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut not now\u201d\n\n\u201cThis minute\u201d\n\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her.",
    "Finally John Cavendish finding\nhis persuasions of no avail went off to look up the trains.",
    "His wife\nfollowed him murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\nthink better of it.",
    "As she left the room Miss Howard\u2019s face changed.",
    "She leant towards me\neagerly.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Hastings you\u2019re honest.",
    "I can trust you\u201d\n\nI was a little startled.",
    "She laid her hand on my arm and sank her\nvoice to a whisper.",
    "\u201cLook after her Mr. Hastings.",
    "My poor Emily.",
    "They\u2019re a lot of\nsharks\u2014all of them.",
    "Oh I know what I\u2019m talking about.",
    "There isn\u2019t one\nof them that\u2019s not hard up and trying to get money out of her.",
    "I\u2019ve\nprotected her as much as I could.",
    "Now I\u2019m out of the way they\u2019ll\nimpose upon her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course Miss Howard\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can but I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019re excited and overwrought.\u201d\n\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.",
    "\u201cYoung man trust me.",
    "I\u2019ve lived in the world rather longer than you\nhave.",

    "You\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d\n\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window and Miss Howard\nrose and moved to the door.",
    "John\u2019s voice sounded outside.",
    "With her hand\non the handle she turned her head over her shoulder and beckoned to\nme.",
    "\u201cAbove all Mr. Hastings watch that devil\u2014her husband\u201d\n\nThere was no time for more.",
    "Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\nchorus of protests and goodbyes.",
    "The Inglethorps did not appear.",
    "As the motor drove away Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\nthe group and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house.",
    "The colour\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.",
    "\u201cWho is that\u201d I asked sharply for instinctively I distrusted the man.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Bauerstein\u201d said John shortly.",
    "\u201cAnd who is Dr. Bauerstein\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s staying in the village doing a rest cure after a bad nervous\nbreakdown.",
    "He\u2019s a London specialist a very clever man\u2014one of the\ngreatest living experts on poisons I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s a great friend of Mary\u2019s\u201d put in Cynthia the irrepressible.",
    "John Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.",
    "\u201cCome for a stroll Hastings.",
    "This has been a most rotten business.",
    "She\nalways had a rough tongue but there is no stauncher friend in England\nthan Evelyn Howard.\u201d\n\nHe took the path through the plantation and we walked down to the\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.",
    "As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again a pretty\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\nsmiled.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty girl\u201d I remarked appreciatively.",
    "John\u2019s face hardened.",
    "\u201cThat is Mrs. Raikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one that Miss Howard\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly\u201d said John with rather unnecessary abruptness.",
    "I thought of the whitehaired old lady in the big house and that vivid\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours and a vague chill of\nforeboding crept over me.",
    "I brushed it aside.",
    "\u201cStyles is really a glorious old place\u201d I said to John.",
    "He nodded rather gloomily.",
    "\u201cYes it\u2019s a fine property.",
    "It\u2019ll be mine some day\u2014should be mine now\nby rights if my father had only made a decent will.",

    "That is up to now.",
    "Since\nher marriage of course\u2014\u2014\u201d he broke off frowning.",
    "For the first time I felt that with Evelyn Howard something\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere.",
    "Her presence had spelt\nsecurity.",
    "Now that security was removed\u2014and the air seemed rife with\nsuspicion.",
    "The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\nunpleasantly.",
    "A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\nmind.",
    "Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.",
    "CHAPTER II.",
    "THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY\n\n\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July.",
    "I come now to the events of\nthe 16th and 17th of that month.",
    "For the convenience of the reader I\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\npossible.",
    "They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\nlong and tedious crossexaminations.",
    "I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\ndeparture telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\nMiddlingham a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away and begging\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\nreconciled.",
    "The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s\nextraordinary and for my part unaccountable preference for the\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein.",
    "What she saw in the man I cannot imagine\nbut she was always asking him up to the house and often went off for\nlong expeditions with him.",
    "I must confess that I was quite unable to\nsee his attraction.",
    "The 16th of July fell on a Monday.",
    "It was a day of turmoil.",
    "The famous\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday and an entertainment in connection\nwith the same charity at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\npoem was to be held that night.",
    "We were all busy during the morning\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\nplace.",
    "We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\ngarden.",
    "I noticed that John\u2019s manner was somewhat unusual.",
    "He seemed\nvery excited and restless.",
    "After tea Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.",
    "About a quarter to seven Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\nlate as supper was early that night.",
    "We had rather a scramble to get\nready in time and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\nthe door.",
    "The entertainment was a great success Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s recitation\nreceiving tremendous applause.",
    "There were also some tableaux in which\nCynthia took part.",
    "She did not return with us having been asked to a\nsupper party and to remain the night with some friends who had been\nacting with her in the tableaux.",
    "The following morning Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast as\nshe was rather overtired but she appeared in her briskest mood about\n12.30 and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.",
    "\u201cSuch a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston.",
    "Lady Tadminster\u2019s\nsister you know.",
    "The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror\u2014one of\nour oldest families.\u201d\n\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\nBauerstein.",
    "We had a pleasant luncheon and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\nthat we should return by Tadminster which was barely a mile out of our\nway and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp\nreplied that this was an excellent idea but as she had several letters\nto write she would drop us there and we could come back with Cynthia\nin the ponytrap.",
    "We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter until Cynthia\nappeared to vouch for us looking very cool and sweet in her long white\noverall.",
    "She took us up to her sanctum and introduced us to her fellow\ndispenser a rather aweinspiring individual whom Cynthia cheerily\naddressed as \u201cNibs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a lot of bottles\u201d I exclaimed as my eye travelled round the\nsmall room.",
    "\u201cDo you really know what\u2019s in them all\u201d\n\n\u201cSay something original\u201d groaned Cynthia.",
    "\u201cEvery single person who\ncomes up here says that.",
    "We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\nthe first individual who does not say \u2018What a lot of bottles\u2019 And I\nknow the next thing you\u2019re going to say is \u2018How many people have you\npoisoned\u2019\u201d\n\nI pleaded guilty with a laugh.",
    "\u201cIf you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\nmistake you wouldn\u2019t joke about it.",
    "Come on let\u2019s have tea.",
    "We\u2019ve got\nall sorts of secret stores in that cupboard.",
    "No Lawrence\u2014that\u2019s the\npoison cupboard.",
    "The big cupboard\u2014that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nWe had a very cheery tea and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.",
    "We had just put away the last teaspoon when a knock came at the door.",
    "The countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\nstern and forbidding expression.",
    "\u201cCome in\u201d said Cynthia in a sharp professional tone.",
    "A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\nshe proffered to Nibs who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\nenigmatical remark\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really here today.\u201d\n\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.",
    "\u201cThis should have been sent up this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cSister is very sorry.",
    "She forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cSister should read the rules outside the door.\u201d\n\nI gathered from the little nurse\u2019s expression that there was not the\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\nthe dreaded \u201cSister\u201d.",
    "\u201cSo now it can\u2019t be done until tomorrow\u201d finished Cynthia.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you think you could possibly let us have it tonight\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Cynthia graciously \u201cwe are very busy but if we have time\nit shall be done.\u201d\n\nThe little nurse withdrew and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\nshelf refilled the bottle and placed it on the table outside the\ndoor.",
    "I laughed.",
    "\u201cDiscipline must be maintained\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.",
    "Come out on our little balcony.",
    "You can see all the outside\nwards there.\u201d\n\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\nwards to me.",
    "Lawrence remained behind but after a few moments Cynthia\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us.",
    "Then she looked at\nher watch.",
    "\u201cNothing more to do Nibs\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.",
    "Then we can lock up and go.\u201d\n\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon.",
    "Compared\nto John he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know.",
    "He was\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect being unusually\nshy and reserved.",
    "Yet he had a certain charm of manner and I fancied\nthat if one really knew him well one could have a deep affection for\nhim.",
    "I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\nconstrained and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.",
    "But they were both gay enough this afternoon and chatted together like\na couple of children.",
    "As we drove through the village I remembered that I wanted some\nstamps so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.",
    "As I came out again I cannoned into a little man who was just\nentering.",
    "I drew aside and apologised when suddenly with a loud\nexclamation he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.",
    "\u201cMon ami Hastings\u201d he cried.",
    "\u201cIt is indeed mon ami Hastings\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "I turned to the ponytrap.",
    "\u201cThis is a very pleasant meeting for me Miss Cynthia.",
    "This is my old\nfriend Monsieur Poirot whom I have not seen for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh we know Monsieur Poirot\u201d said Cynthia gaily.",
    "\u201cBut I had no idea\nhe was a friend of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes indeed\u201d said Poirot seriously.",
    "\u201cI know Mademoiselle Cynthia.",
    "It\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.\u201d Then\nas I looked at him inquiringly \u201cYes my friend she had kindly\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who alas are\nrefugees from their native land.",
    "We Belgians will always remember her\nwith gratitude.\u201d\n\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man.",
    "He was hardly more than\nfive feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity.",
    "His\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg and he always perched it a little\non one side.",
    "His moustache was very stiff and military.",
    "The neatness of\nhis attire was almost incredible.",
    "I believe a speck of dust would have\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound.",
    "Yet this quaint dandified\nlittle man who I was sorry to see now limped badly had been in his\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.",
    "As a\ndetective his flair had been extraordinary and he had achieved\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.",
    "He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\nBelgians and I promised to go and see him at an early date.",
    "Then he\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia and we drove away.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s a dear little man\u201d said Cynthia.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d no idea you knew him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares\u201d I replied.",
    "And for the rest of the way home I recited to them the various\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.",
    "We arrived back in a very cheerful mood.",
    "As we entered the hall Mrs.\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir.",
    "She looked flushed and upset.",
    "\u201cOh it\u2019s you\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIs there anything the matter Aunt Emily\u201d asked Cynthia.",
    "\u201cCertainly not\u201d said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply.",
    "\u201cWhat should there be\u201d\nThen catching sight of Dorcas the parlourmaid going into the\ndiningroom she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.",
    "\u201cYes m\u2019m.\u201d The old servant hesitated then added diffidently \u201cDon\u2019t\nyou think m\u2019m you\u2019d better get to bed You\u2019re looking very tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right Dorcas\u2014yes\u2014no\u2014not now.",
    "I\u2019ve some letters I must\nfinish by posttime.",
    "Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\nyou\u201d\n\n\u201cYes m\u2019m.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go to bed directly after supper.\u201d\n\nShe went into the boudoir again and Cynthia stared after her.",
    "\u201cGoodness gracious I wonder what\u2019s up\u201d she said to Lawrence.",
    "He did not seem to have heard her for without a word he turned on his\nheel and went out of the house.",
    "I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and Cynthia agreeing\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs.",
    "It may have been my fancy\nbut she too was looking odd and disturbed.",
    "\u201cHad a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein\u201d I asked trying to appear as\nindifferent as I could.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t go\u201d she replied abruptly.",
    "\u201cWhere is Mrs. Inglethorp\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the boudoir.\u201d\n\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters then she seemed to nerve\nherself for some encounter and went rapidly past me down the stairs\nacross the hall to the boudoir the door of which she shut behind her.",
    "As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later I had to pass the\nopen boudoir window and was unable to help overhearing the following\nscrap of dialogue.",
    "Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\ndesperately controlling herself\n\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t show it to me\u201d\n\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied\n\n\u201cMy dear Mary it has nothing to do with that matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen show it to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you it is not what you imagine.",
    "It does not concern you in the\nleast.\u201d\n\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied with a rising bitterness\n\n\u201cOf course I might have known you would shield him.\u201d\n\nCynthia was waiting for me and greeted me eagerly with\n\n\u201cI say There\u2019s been the most awful row I\u2019ve got it all out of\nDorcas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a row\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween Aunt Emily and him.",
    "I do hope she\u2019s found him out at last\u201d\n\n\u201cWas Dorcas there then\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not.",
    "She \u2018happened to be near the door\u2019.",
    "It was a real old\nbustup.",
    "I do wish I knew what it was all about.\u201d\n\nI thought of Mrs. Raikes\u2019s gipsy face and Evelyn Howard\u2019s warnings\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace whilst Cynthia exhausted every\npossible hypothesis and cheerfully hoped \u201cAunt Emily will send him\naway and will never speak to him again.\u201d\n\nI was anxious to get hold of John but he was nowhere to be seen.",
    "Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon.",
    "I tried\nto forget the few words I had overheard but do what I would I could\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind.",
    "What was Mary Cavendish\u2019s\nconcern in the matter\n\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawingroom when I came down to supper.",
    "His\nface was impassive as ever and the strange unreality of the man struck\nme afresh.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp came down last.",
    "She still looked agitated and during\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence.",
    "Inglethorp was\nunusually quiet.",
    "As a rule he surrounded his wife with little\nattentions placing a cushion at her back and altogether playing the\npart of the devoted husband.",
    "Immediately after supper Mrs. Inglethorp\nretired to her boudoir again.",
    "\u201cSend my coffee in here Mary\u201d she called.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve just five minutes to\ncatch the post.\u201d\n\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawingroom.",
    "Mary\nCavendish brought our coffee to us.",
    "She seemed excited.",
    "\u201cDo you young people want lights or do you enjoy the twilight\u201d she\nasked.",
    "\u201cWill you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee Cynthia I will pour\nit out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not trouble Mary\u201d said Inglethorp.",
    "\u201cI will take it to Emily.\u201d He\npoured it out and went out of the room carrying it carefully.",
    "Lawrence followed him and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.",
    "We three sat for some time in silence.",
    "It was a glorious night hot and\nstill.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s almost too hot\u201d she murmured.",
    "\u201cWe shall have a thunderstorm.\u201d\n\nAlas that these harmonious moments can never endure My paradise was\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known and heartily disliked\nvoice in the hall.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Bauerstein\u201d exclaimed Cynthia.",
    "\u201cWhat a funny time to come.\u201d\n\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish but she seemed quite\nundisturbed the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.",
    "In a few moments Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in the\nlatter laughing and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\ndrawingroom.",
    "In truth he presented a sorry spectacle being literally\nplastered with mud.",
    "\u201cWhat have you been doing doctor\u201d cried Mrs. Cavendish.",
    "\u201cI must make my apologies\u201d said the doctor.",
    "\u201cI did not really mean to\ncome in but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell Bauerstein you are in a plight\u201d said John strolling in from\nthe hall.",
    "\u201cHave some coffee and tell us what you have been up to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you I will.\u201d He laughed rather ruefully as he described how he\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing and slipped\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.",
    "\u201cThe sun soon dried me off\u201d he added \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid my appearance is\nvery disreputable.\u201d\n\nAt this juncture Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall and\nthe girl ran out.",
    "\u201cJust carry up my despatchcase will you dear I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\nThe door into the hall was a wide one.",
    "I had risen when Cynthia did\nJohn was close by me.",
    "There were therefore three witnesses who could\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee as yet untasted in\nher hand.",
    "My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\nBauerstein.",
    "It seemed to me the man would never go.",
    "He rose at last\nhowever and I breathed a sigh of relief.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll walk down to the village with you\u201d said Mr. Inglethorp.",
    "\u201cI must\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.\u201d He turned to John.",
    "\u201cNo one\nneed sit up.",
    "I will take the latchkey.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.",
    "THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY\n\n\nTo make this part of my story clear I append the following plan of the\nfirst floor of Styles.",
    "The servants\u2019 rooms are reached through the door\nB.",
    "They have no communication with the right wing where the\nInglethorps\u2019 rooms were situated.",
    "Illustration\n\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\nCavendish.",
    "He had a candle in his hand and the agitation of his face\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u201d I asked sitting up in bed and trying to collect\nmy scattered thoughts.",
    "\u201cWe are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\nof fit.",
    "Unfortunately she has locked herself in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come at once.\u201d\n\nI sprang out of bed and pulling on a dressinggown followed Lawrence\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.",
    "John Cavendish joined us and one or two of the servants were standing\nround in a state of awestricken excitement.",
    "Lawrence turned to his\nbrother.",
    "\u201cWhat do you think we had better do\u201d\n\nNever I thought had his indecision of character been more apparent.",
    "John rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s door violently but with\nno effect.",
    "It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside.",
    "The whole\nhousehold was aroused by now.",
    "The most alarming sounds were audible\nfrom the interior of the room.",
    "Clearly something must be done.",
    "\u201cTry going through Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s room sir\u201d cried Dorcas.",
    "\u201cOh the\npoor mistress\u201d\n\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us\u2014that he\nalone had given no sign of his presence.",
    "John opened the door of his\nroom.",
    "It was pitch dark but Lawrence was following with the candle\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in and\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.",
    "We went straight to the connecting door.",
    "That too was locked or\nbolted on the inside.",
    "What was to be done\n\n\u201cOh dear sir\u201d cried Dorcas wringing her hands \u201cwhat ever shall we\ndo\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must try and break the door in I suppose.",
    "It\u2019ll be a tough job\nthough.",
    "Here let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once.",
    "Now then we\u2019ll have a try at the door.",
    "Half a moment though isn\u2019t there a door into Miss Cynthia\u2019s rooms\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir but that\u2019s always bolted.",
    "It\u2019s never been undone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we might just see.\u201d\n\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia\u2019s room.",
    "Mary Cavendish was\nthere shaking the girl\u2014who must have been an unusually sound\nsleeper\u2014and trying to wake her.",
    "In a moment or two he was back.",
    "\u201cNo good.",
    "That\u2019s bolted too.",
    "We must break in the door.",
    "I think this\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.\u201d\n\nWe strained and heaved together.",
    "The framework of the door was solid\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts but at last we felt it\ngive beneath our weight and finally with a resounding crash it was\nburst open.",
    "We stumbled in together Lawrence still holding his candle.",
    "Mrs.\nInglethorp was lying on the bed her whole form agitated by violent\nconvulsions in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\nher.",
    "As we entered however her limbs relaxed and she fell back upon\nthe pillows.",
    "John strode across the room and lit the gas.",
    "Turning to Annie one of\nthe housemaids he sent her downstairs to the diningroom for brandy.",
    "Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\non the corridor.",
    "I turned to Lawrence to suggest that I had better leave them now that\nthere was no further need of my services but the words were frozen on\nmy lips.",
    "Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man\u2019s face.",
    "He\nwas white as chalk the candle he held in his shaking hand was\nsputtering onto the carpet and his eyes petrified with terror or\nsome such kindred emotion stared fixedly over my head at a point on\nthe further wall.",
    "It was as though he had seen something that turned\nhim to stone.",
    "I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes but I\ncould see nothing unusual.",
    "The still feebly flickering ashes in the\ngrate and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece were surely\nharmless enough.",
    "The violence of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s attack seemed to be passing.",
    "She was\nable to speak in short gasps.",
    "\u201cBetter now\u2014very sudden\u2014stupid of me\u2014to lock myself in.\u201d\n\nA shadow fell on the bed and looking up I saw Mary Cavendish standing\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia.",
    "She seemed to be supporting\nthe girl who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself.",
    "Her face was\nheavily flushed and she yawned repeatedly.",
    "\u201cPoor Cynthia is quite frightened\u201d said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\nvoice.",
    "She herself I noticed was dressed in her white land smock.",
    "Then it must be later than I thought.",
    "I saw that a faint streak of\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows and that the\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o\u2019clock.",
    "A strangled cry from the bed startled me.",
    "A fresh access of pain seized\nthe unfortunate old lady.",
    "The convulsions were of a violence terrible\nto behold.",
    "Everything was confusion.",
    "We thronged round her powerless\nto help or alleviate.",
    "A final convulsion lifted her from the bed until\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels with her body arched\nin an extraordinary manner.",
    "In vain Mary and John tried to administer\nmore brandy.",
    "The moments flew.",
    "Again the body arched itself in that\npeculiar fashion.",
    "At that moment Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\nroom.",
    "For one instant he stopped dead staring at the figure on the\nbed and at the same instant Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\nvoice her eyes fixed on the doctor\n\n\u201cAlfred\u2014Alfred\u2014\u2014\u201d Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.",
    "With a stride the doctor reached the bed and seizing her arms worked\nthem energetically applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.",
    "He issued a few short sharp orders to the servants.",
    "An imperious wave\nof his hand drove us all to the door.",
    "We watched him fascinated\nthough I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late and that\nnothing could be done now.",
    "I could see by the expression on his face\nthat he himself had little hope.",
    "Finally he abandoned his task shaking his head gravely.",
    "At that\nmoment we heard footsteps outside and Dr. Wilkins Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\nown doctor a portly fussy little man came bustling in.",
    "In a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out and had run up to the\nhouse as fast as he could whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.",
    "With a faint gesture of the hand he indicated the figure on the bed.",
    "\u201cVe\u2014ry sad.",
    "Ve\u2014ry sad\u201d murmured Dr. Wilkins.",
    "\u201cPoor dear lady.",
    "Always\ndid far too much\u2014far too much\u2014against my advice.",
    "I warned her.",
    "Her\nheart was far from strong.",
    "\u2018Take it easy\u2019 I said to her\n\u2018Take\u2014it\u2014easy\u2019.",
    "But no\u2014her zeal for good works was too great.",
    "Nature\nrebelled.",
    "Na\u2014ture\u2014re\u2014belled.\u201d\n\nDr. Bauerstein I noticed was watching the local doctor narrowly.",
    "He\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.",
    "\u201cThe convulsions were of a peculiar violence Dr. Wilkins.",
    "I am sorry\nyou were not here in time to witness them.",
    "They were quite\u2014tetanic in\ncharacter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Dr. Wilkins wisely.",
    "\u201cI should like to speak to you in private\u201d said Dr. Bauerstein.",
    "He\nturned to John.",
    "\u201cYou do not object\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\nWe all trooped out into the corridor leaving the two doctors alone\nand I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.",
    "We went slowly down the stairs.",
    "I was violently excited.",
    "I have a\ncertain talent for deduction and Dr. Bauerstein\u2019s manner had started a\nflock of wild surmises in my mind.",
    "Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\narm.",
    "\u201cWhat is it Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so\u2014peculiar\u201d\n\nI looked at her.",
    "\u201cDo you know what I think\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cListen\u201d I looked round the others were out of earshot.",
    "I lowered my\nvoice to a whisper.",
    "\u201cI believe she has been poisoned I\u2019m certain Dr.\nBauerstein suspects it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d She shrank against the wall the pupils of her eyes dilating\nwildly.",
    "Then with a sudden cry that startled me she cried out \u201cNo\nno\u2014not that\u2014not that\u201d And breaking from me fled up the stairs.",
    "I\nfollowed her afraid that she was going to faint.",
    "I found her leaning\nagainst the bannisters deadly pale.",
    "She waved me away impatiently.",
    "\u201cNo no\u2014leave me.",
    "I\u2019d rather be alone.",
    "Let me just be quiet for a\nminute or two.",
    "Go down to the others.\u201d\n\nI obeyed her reluctantly.",
    "John and Lawrence were in the diningroom.",
    "I\njoined them.",
    "We were all silent but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\nus all when I at last broke it by saying\n\n\u201cWhere is Mr. Inglethorp\u201d\n\nJohn shook his head.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s not in the house.\u201d\n\nOur eyes met.",
    "Where was Alfred Inglethorp His absence was strange\nand inexplicable.",
    "I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s dying words.",
    "What lay\nbeneath them What more could she have told us if she had had time\n\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs.",
    "Dr. Wilkins was\nlooking important and excited and trying to conceal an inward\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm.",
    "Dr. Bauerstein remained in\nthe background his grave bearded face unchanged.",
    "Dr. Wilkins was the\nspokesman for the two.",
    "He addressed himself to John\n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Cavendish I should like your consent to a postmortem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that necessary\u201d asked John gravely.",
    "A spasm of pain crossed his\nface.",
    "\u201cAbsolutely\u201d said Dr. Bauerstein.",
    "\u201cYou mean by that\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\nunder the circumstances.\u201d\n\nJohn bent his head.",
    "\u201cIn that case I have no alternative but to agree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d said Dr. Wilkins briskly.",
    "\u201cWe propose that it should take\nplace tomorrow night\u2014or rather tonight.\u201d And he glanced at the\ndaylight.",
    "\u201cUnder the circumstances I am afraid an inquest can hardly\nbe avoided\u2014these formalities are necessary but I beg that you won\u2019t\ndistress yourselves.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\npocket and handed them to John.",
    "\u201cThese are the keys of the two rooms.",
    "I have locked them and in my\nopinion they would be better kept locked for the present.\u201d\n\nThe doctors then departed.",
    "I had been turning over an idea in my head and I felt that the moment\nhad now come to broach it.",
    "Yet I was a little chary of doing so.",
    "John\nI knew had a horror of any kind of publicity and was an easygoing\noptimist who preferred never to meet trouble halfway.",
    "It might be\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan.",
    "Lawrence on the\nother hand being less conventional and having more imagination I\nfelt I might count upon as an ally.",
    "There was no doubt that the moment\nhad come for me to take the lead.",
    "\u201cJohn\u201d I said \u201cI am going to ask you something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember my speaking of my friend Poirot The Belgian who is here\nHe has been a most famous detective.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to let me call him in\u2014to investigate this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2014now Before the postmortem\u201d\n\n\u201cYes time is an advantage if\u2014if\u2014there has been foul play.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish\u201d cried Lawrence angrily.",
    "\u201cIn my opinion the whole thing is a\nmare\u2019s nest of Bauerstein\u2019s Wilkins hadn\u2019t an idea of such a thing\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head.",
    "But like all specialists\nBauerstein\u2019s got a bee in his bonnet.",
    "Poisons are his hobby so of\ncourse he sees them everywhere.\u201d\n\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrence\u2019s attitude.",
    "He was so seldom\nvehement about anything.",
    "John hesitated.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t feel as you do Lawrence\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m inclined to\ngive Hastings a free hand though I should prefer to wait a bit.",
    "We\ndon\u2019t want any unnecessary scandal.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo no\u201d I cried eagerly \u201cyou need have no fear of that.",
    "Poirot is\ndiscretion itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well then have it your own way.",
    "I leave it in your hands.",
    "Though if it is as we suspect it seems a clear enough case.",
    "God\nforgive me if I am wronging him\u201d\n\nI looked at my watch.",
    "It was six o\u2019clock.",
    "I determined to lose no time.",
    "Five minutes\u2019 delay however I allowed myself.",
    "I spent it in\nransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.",
    "CHAPTER IV.",
    "POIROT INVESTIGATES\n\n\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\nthe park gates.",
    "One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\nlong grass which cut off the detours of the winding drive.",
    "So I\naccordingly went that way.",
    "I had nearly reached the lodge when my\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.",
    "It was Mr. Inglethorp.",
    "Where had he been How did he intend to explain\nhis absence\n\nHe accosted me eagerly.",
    "\u201cMy God This is terrible My poor wife I have only just heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere have you been\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cDenby kept me late last night.",
    "It was one o\u2019clock before we\u2019d\nfinished.",

    "I\ndidn\u2019t want to arouse the household so Denby gave me a bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you hear the news\u201d I asked.",

    "My poor Emily She was so\nselfsacrificing\u2014such a noble character.",
    "She overtaxed her strength.\u201d\n\nA wave of revulsion swept over me.",
    "What a consummate hypocrite the man\nwas\n\n\u201cI must hurry on\u201d I said thankful that he did not ask me whither I\nwas bound.",
    "In a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.",
    "Getting no answer I repeated my summons impatiently.",
    "A window above me\nwas cautiously opened and Poirot himself looked out.",
    "He gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me.",
    "In a few brief words\nI explained the tragedy that had occurred and that I wanted his help.",
    "\u201cWait my friend I will let you in and you shall recount to me the\naffair whilst I dress.\u201d\n\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door and I followed him up to his\nroom.",
    "There he installed me in a chair and I related the whole story\nkeeping back nothing and omitting no circumstance however\ninsignificant whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.",
    "I told him of my awakening of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s dying words of her\nhusband\u2019s absence of the quarrel the day before of the scrap of\nconversation between Mary and her motherinlaw that I had overheard\nof the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard and of\nthe latter\u2019s innuendoes.",
    "I was hardly as clear as I could wish.",
    "I repeated myself several times\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.",
    "Poirot smiled kindly on me.",
    "\u201cThe mind is confused Is it not so Take time mon ami.",
    "You are\nagitated you are excited\u2014it is but natural.",
    "Presently when we are\ncalmer we will arrange the facts neatly each in his proper place.",
    "We\nwill examine\u2014and reject.",
    "Those of importance we will put on one side\nthose of no importance pouf\u201d\u2014he screwed up his cherublike face and\npuffed comically enough\u2014\u201cblow them away\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well\u201d I objected \u201cbut how are you going to decide\nwhat is important and what isn\u2019t That always seems the difficulty to\nme.\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head energetically.",
    "He was now arranging his moustache\nwith exquisite care.",
    "\u201cNot so.",
    "Voyons One fact leads to another\u2014so we continue.",
    "Does the\nnext fit in with that A merveille Good We can proceed.",
    "This next\nlittle fact\u2014no Ah that is curious There is something missing\u2014a link\nin the chain that is not there.",
    "We examine.",
    "We search.",
    "And that little\ncurious fact that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally\nwe put it here\u201d He made an extravagant gesture with his hand.",

    "\u201cBeware Peril to the detective who says \u2018It is so small\u2014it\ndoes not matter.",
    "It will not agree.",
    "I will forget it.\u2019 That way lies\nconfusion Everything matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.",
    "You always told me that.",
    "That\u2019s why I have gone into all the\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I am pleased with you.",
    "You have a good memory and you have given\nme the facts faithfully.",
    "Of the order in which you present them I say\nnothing\u2014truly it is deplorable But I make allowances\u2014you are upset.",
    "To that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\nparamount importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cYou have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.\u201d\n\nI stared at him.",
    "Surely the war had affected the little man\u2019s brain.",
    "He\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on and\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAnd anyway I don\u2019t see\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not see But it is of the first importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see why\u201d I said rather nettled.",
    "\u201cAs far as I can remember\nshe didn\u2019t eat much.",
    "She was obviously upset and it had taken her\nappetite away.",
    "That was only natural.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully \u201cit was only natural.\u201d\n\nHe opened a drawer and took out a small despatchcase then turned to\nme.",
    "\u201cNow I am ready.",
    "We will proceed to the ch\u00e2teau and study matters on\nthe spot.",
    "Excuse me mon ami you dressed in haste and your tie is\non one side.",
    "Permit me.\u201d With a deft gesture he rearranged it.",
    "\u201c\u00c7a y est Now shall we start\u201d\n\nWe hurried up the village and turned in at the lodge gates.",
    "Poirot\nstopped for a moment and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\nof park still glittering with morning dew.",
    "\u201cSo beautiful so beautiful and yet the poor family plunged in\nsorrow prostrated with grief.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke and I was aware that I reddened\nunder his prolonged gaze.",
    "Was the family prostrated by grief Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\ndeath so great I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\natmosphere.",
    "The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love.",
    "Her\ndeath was a shock and a distress but she would not be passionately\nregretted.",
    "Poirot seemed to follow my thoughts.",
    "He nodded his head gravely.",
    "\u201cNo you are right\u201d he said \u201cit is not as though there was a blood\ntie.",
    "She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes but she was\nnot their own mother.",
    "Blood tells\u2014always remember that\u2014blood tells.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I said \u201cI wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night I have been turning it over in my\nmind but I can\u2019t see how it has anything to do with the matter\u201d\n\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along but finally he\nsaid\n\n\u201cI do not mind telling you\u2014though as you know it is not my habit to\nexplain until the end is reached.",
    "The present contention is that Mrs.\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning presumably administered in her\ncoffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what time was the coffee served\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout eight o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore she drank it between then and halfpast eight\u2014certainly not\nmuch later.",
    "Well strychnine is a fairly rapid poison.",
    "Its effects\nwould be felt very soon probably in about an hour.",
    "Yet in Mrs.\nInglethorp\u2019s case the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\no\u2019clock the next morning nine hours But a heavy meal taken at about\nthe same time as the poison might retard its effects though hardly to\nthat extent.",
    "Still it is a possibility to be taken into account.",
    "But\naccording to you she ate very little for supper and yet the symptoms\ndo not develop until early the next morning Now that is a curious\ncircumstance my friend.",
    "Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\nit.",
    "In the meantime remember it.\u201d\n\nAs we neared the house John came out and met us.",
    "His face looked weary\nand haggard.",
    "\u201cThis is a very dreadful business Monsieur Poirot\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHastings\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity\u201d\n\n\u201cI comprehend perfectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see it is only suspicion so far.",
    "We have nothing to go upon.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.",
    "It is a matter of precaution only.\u201d\n\nJohn turned to me taking out his cigarettecase and lighting a\ncigarette as he did so.",
    "\u201cYou know that fellow Inglethorp is back\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "I met him.\u201d\n\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed a proceeding which\nwas too much for Poirot\u2019s feelings.",
    "He retrieved it and buried it\nneatly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat difficulty will not exist long\u201d pronounced Poirot quietly.",
    "John looked puzzled not quite understanding the portent of this\ncryptic saying.",
    "He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\nhim to me.",
    "\u201cShow Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rooms are locked\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Bauerstein considered it advisable.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThen he is very sure.",
    "Well that simplifies matters for us.\u201d\n\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy.",
    "For convenience I\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\nit.",
    "Illustration\n\nPoirot locked the door on the inside and proceeded to a minute\ninspection of the room.",
    "He darted from one object to the other with the\nagility of a grasshopper.",
    "I remained by the door fearing to obliterate\nany clues.",
    "Poirot however did not seem grateful to me for my\nforbearance.",
    "\u201cWhat have you my friend\u201d he cried \u201cthat you remain there like\u2014how\ndo you say it\u2014ah yes the stuck pig\u201d\n\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any footmarks.",
    "\u201cFootmarks But what an idea There has already been practically an\narmy in the room What footmarks are we likely to find No come here\nand aid me in my search.",
    "I will put down my little case until I need\nit.\u201d\n\nHe did so on the round table by the window but it was an illadvised\nproceeding for the top of it being loose it tilted up and\nprecipitated the despatchcase on the floor.",
    "\u201cEh voil\u00e0 une table\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cAh my friend one may live in a\nbig house and yet have no comfort.\u201d\n\nAfter which piece of moralizing he resumed his search.",
    "A small purple despatchcase with a key in the lock on the\nwritingtable engaged his attention for some time.",
    "He took out the key\nfrom the lock and passed it to me to inspect.",
    "I saw nothing peculiar\nhowever.",
    "It was an ordinary key of the Yale type with a bit of twisted\nwire through the handle.",
    "Next he examined the framework of the door we had broken in assuring\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot.",
    "Then he went to the door\nopposite leading into Cynthia\u2019s room.",
    "That door was also bolted as I\nhad stated.",
    "However he went to the length of unbolting it and opening\nand shutting it several times this he did with the utmost precaution\nagainst making any noise.",
    "Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\nto rivet his attention.",
    "He examined it carefully and then nimbly\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case he drew out some\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.",
    "On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\nsaucepan on it.",
    "A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\nsaucepan and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\nnear it.",
    "I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.",
    "Here was a clue worth having.",
    "Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\nliquid and tasted it gingerly.",
    "He made a grimace.",
    "\u201cCocoa\u2014with\u2014I think\u2014rum in it.\u201d\n\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor where the table by the bed had\nbeen overturned.",
    "A readinglamp some books matches a bunch of keys\nand the crushed fragments of a coffeecup lay scattered about.",
    "\u201cAh this is curious\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not Observe the lamp\u2014the chimney is broken in two places they\nlie there as they fell.",
    "But see the coffeecup is absolutely smashed\nto powder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d I said wearily \u201cI suppose someone must have stepped on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly\u201d said Poirot in an odd voice.",
    "\u201cSomeone stepped on it.\u201d\n\nHe rose from his knees and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments and straightening\nthem\u2014a trick of his when he was agitated.",
    "\u201cMon ami\u201d he said turning to me \u201csomebody stepped on that cup\ngrinding it to powder and the reason they did so was either because it\ncontained strychnine or\u2014which is far more serious\u2014because it did not\ncontain strychnine\u201d\n\nI made no reply.",
    "I was bewildered but I knew that it was no good\nasking him to explain.",
    "In a moment or two he roused himself and went\non with his investigations.",
    "He picked up the bunch of keys from the\nfloor and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one\nvery bright and shining which he tried in the lock of the purple\ndespatchcase.",
    "It fitted and he opened the box but after a moment\u2019s\nhesitation closed and relocked it and slipped the bunch of keys as\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock into his own\npocket.",
    "\u201cI have no authority to go through these papers.",
    "But it should be\ndone\u2014at once\u201d\n\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\nwashstand.",
    "Crossing the room to the lefthand window a round stain\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet seemed to interest him\nparticularly.",
    "He went down on his knees examining it minutely\u2014even\ngoing so far as to smell it.",
    "Finally he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube sealing\nit up carefully.",
    "His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.",
    "\u201cWe have found in this room\u201d he said writing busily \u201csix points of\ninterest.",
    "Shall I enumerate them or will you\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you\u201d I replied hastily.",
    "\u201cVery well then.",
    "One a coffeecup that has been ground into powder\ntwo a despatchcase with a key in the lock three a stain on the\nfloor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat may have been done some time ago\u201d I interrupted.",
    "\u201cNo for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee.",
    "Four a\nfragment of some dark green fabric\u2014only a thread or two but\nrecognizable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cThat was what you sealed up in the envelope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s own\ndresses and quite unimportant.",
    "We shall see.",
    "Five this\u201d With a\ndramatic gesture he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\nfloor by the writingtable.",
    "\u201cIt must have been done since yesterday\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\nblottingpaper and a hot iron.",
    "One of my best hats once\u2014but that is not\nto the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was very likely done last night.",
    "We were very agitated.",
    "Or perhaps\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought only one candle into the room\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it.",
    "But he was very upset.",
    "He\nseemed to see something over here\u201d\u2014I indicated the mantelpiece\u2014\u201cthat\nabsolutely paralysed him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is interesting\u201d said Poirot quickly.",
    "\u201cYes it is suggestive\u201d\u2014his\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall\u2014\u201cbut it was not his candle\nthat made this great patch for you perceive that this is white grease\nwhereas Monsieur Lawrence\u2019s candle which is still on the\ndressingtable is pink.",
    "On the other hand Mrs. Inglethorp had no\ncandlestick in the room only a readinglamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen\u201d I said \u201cwhat do you deduce\u201d\n\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply urging me to\nuse my own natural faculties.",
    "\u201cAnd the sixth point\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cI suppose it is the sample of cocoa.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI might have included that in the six\nbut I did not.",
    "No the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\npresent.\u201d\n\nHe looked quickly round the room.",
    "\u201cThere is nothing more to be done\nhere I think unless\u201d\u2014he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\nin the grate.",
    "\u201cThe fire burns\u2014and it destroys.",
    "But by chance\u2014there\nmight be\u2014let us see\u201d\n\nDeftly on hands and knees he began to sort the ashes from the grate\ninto the fender handling them with the greatest caution.",
    "Suddenly he\ngave a faint exclamation.",
    "\u201cThe forceps Hastings\u201d\n\nI quickly handed them to him and with skill he extracted a small piece\nof half charred paper.",
    "\u201cThere mon ami\u201d he cried.",
    "\u201cWhat do you think of that\u201d\n\nI scrutinized the fragment.",
    "This is an exact reproduction of it\u2014\n\nIllustration\n\nI was puzzled.",
    "It was unusually thick quite unlike ordinary notepaper.",
    "Suddenly an idea struck me.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cThis is a fragment of a will\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\nI looked up at him sharply.",
    "\u201cYou are not surprised\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d he said gravely \u201cI expected it.\u201d\n\nI relinquished the piece of paper and watched him put it away in his\ncase with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything.",
    "My\nbrain was in a whirl.",
    "What was this complication of a will Who had\ndestroyed it The person who had left the candle grease on the floor\nObviously.",
    "But how had anyone gained admission All the doors had been\nbolted on the inside.",
    "\u201cNow my friend\u201d said Poirot briskly \u201cwe will go.",
    "I should like to\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid\u2014Dorcas her name is is it not\u201d\n\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorp\u2019s room and Poirot delayed long\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it.",
    "We\nwent out through that door locking both it and that of Mrs.\nInglethorp\u2019s room as before.",
    "I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see\nand went myself in search of Dorcas.",
    "When I returned with her however the boudoir was empty.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried \u201cwhere are you\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here my friend.\u201d\n\nHe had stepped outside the French window and was standing apparently\nlost in admiration before the various shaped flower beds.",
    "\u201cAdmirable\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cAdmirable What symmetry Observe that\ncrescent and those diamonds\u2014their neatness rejoices the eye.",
    "The\nspacing of the plants also is perfect.",
    "It has been recently done is\nit not so\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon.",
    "But come in\u2014Dorcas\nis here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh bien eh bien Do not grudge me a moment\u2019s satisfaction of the\neye.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but this affair is more important.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\nimportance\u201d\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.",
    "There was really no arguing with him if he\nchose to take that line.",
    "\u201cYou do not agree But such things have been.",
    "Well we will come in and\ninterview the brave Dorcas.\u201d\n\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir her hands folded in front of her\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap.",
    "She was the\nvery model and picture of a good oldfashioned servant.",
    "In her attitude towards Poirot she was inclined to be suspicious but\nhe soon broke down her defences.",
    "He drew forward a chair.",
    "\u201cPray be seated mademoiselle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have been with your mistress many years is it not so\u201d\n\n\u201cTen years sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a long time and very faithful service.",
    "You were much attached\nto her were you not\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a very good mistress to me sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you will not object to answering a few questions.",
    "I put them to\nyou with Mr. Cavendish\u2019s full approval.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh certainly sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\nafternoon.",
    "Your mistress had a quarrel\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "But I don\u2019t know that I ought\u2014\u2014\u201d Dorcas hesitated.",
    "Poirot looked at her keenly.",
    "\u201cMy good Dorcas it is necessary that I should know every detail of\nthat quarrel as fully as possible.",
    "Do not think that you are betraying\nyour mistress\u2019s secrets.",
    "Your mistress lies dead and it is necessary\nthat we should know all\u2014if we are to avenge her.",
    "Nothing can bring her\nback to life but we do hope if there has been foul play to bring the\nmurderer to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen to that\u201d said Dorcas fiercely.",
    "\u201cAnd naming no names there\u2019s\none in this house that none of us could ever abide And an ill day it\nwas when first he darkened the threshold.\u201d\n\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside and then resuming his\nbusinesslike tone he asked\n\n\u201cNow as to this quarrel What is the first you heard of it\u201d\n\n\u201cWell sir I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat time was that\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say exactly sir but it wasn\u2019t teatime by a long way.",
    "Perhaps four o\u2019clock\u2014or it may have been a bit later.",
    "Well sir as I\nsaid I happened to be passing along when I heard voices very loud and\nangry in here.",
    "I didn\u2019t exactly mean to listen but\u2014well there it is.",
    "I stopped.",
    "The door was shut but the mistress was speaking very sharp\nand clear and I heard what she said quite plainly.",
    "\u2018You have lied to\nme and deceived me\u2019 she said.",
    "I didn\u2019t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\nreplied.",
    "He spoke a good bit lower than she did\u2014but she answered \u2018How\ndare you I have kept you and clothed you and fed you You owe\neverything to me And this is how you repay me By bringing disgrace\nupon our name\u2019 Again I didn\u2019t hear what he said but she went on\n\u2018Nothing that you can say will make any difference.",
    "I see my duty\nclearly.",
    "My mind is made up.",
    "You need not think that any fear of\npublicity or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\u2019 Then I\nthought I heard them coming out so I went off quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s voice you heard\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes sir whose else\u2019s could it be\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what happened next\u201d\n\n\u201cLater I came back to the hall but it was all quiet.",
    "At five o\u2019clock\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\ntea\u2014nothing to eat\u2014to the boudoir.",
    "She was looking dreadful\u2014so white\nand upset.",
    "\u2018Dorcas\u2019 she says \u2018I\u2019ve had a great shock.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sorry for\nthat m\u2019m\u2019 I says.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea\nm\u2019m.\u2019 She had something in her hand.",
    "I don\u2019t know if it was a letter\nor just a piece of paper but it had writing on it and she kept\nstaring at it almost as if she couldn\u2019t believe what was written\nthere.",
    "She whispered to herself as though she had forgotten I was\nthere \u2018These few words\u2014and everything\u2019s changed.\u2019 And then she says to\nme \u2018Never trust a man Dorcas they\u2019re not worth it\u2019 I hurried off\nand got her a good strong cup of tea and she thanked me and said\nshe\u2019d feel better when she\u2019d drunk it.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know what to do\u2019 she\nsays.",
    "\u2018Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing Dorcas.",
    "I\u2019d rather hush it up if I could.\u2019 Mrs. Cavendish came in just then so\nshe didn\u2019t say any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe still had the letter or whatever it was in her hand\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would she be likely to do with it afterwards\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know sir I expect she would lock it up in that purple\ncase of hers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that where she usually kept important papers\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "She brought it down with her every morning and took it up\nevery night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did she lose the key of it\u201d\n\n\u201cShe missed it yesterday at lunchtime sir and told me to look\ncarefully for it.",
    "She was very much put out about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she had a duplicate key\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes sir.\u201d\n\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and to tell the truth so was\nI.",
    "What was all this about a lost key Poirot smiled.",
    "\u201cNever mind Dorcas it is my business to know things.",
    "Is this the key\nthat was lost\u201d He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\nthe lock of the despatchcase upstairs.",
    "Dorcas\u2019s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s it sir right enough.",
    "But where did you find it I looked\neverywhere for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\ntoday.",
    "Now to pass to another subject had your mistress a dark green\ndress in her wardrobe\u201d\n\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.",
    "\u201cNo sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you quite sure\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas anyone else in the house got a green dress\u201d\n\nDorcas reflected.",
    "\u201cMiss Cynthia has a green evening dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cLight or dark green\u201d\n\n\u201cA light green sir a sort of chiffon they call it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh that is not what I want.",
    "And nobody else has anything green\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir\u2014not that I know of.\u201d\n\nPoirot\u2019s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\notherwise.",
    "He merely remarked\n\n\u201cGood we will leave that and pass on.",
    "Have you any reason to believe\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night\u201d\n\n\u201cNot last night sir I know she didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you know so positively\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the box was empty.",
    "She took the last one two days ago and she\ndidn\u2019t have any more made up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are quite sure of that\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that is cleared up By the way your mistress didn\u2019t ask you to\nsign any paper yesterday\u201d\n\n\u201cTo sign a paper No sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening they\nfound your mistress busy writing letters.",
    "I suppose you can give me no\nidea to whom these letters were addressed\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t sir.",
    "I was out in the evening.",
    "Perhaps Annie\ncould tell you though she\u2019s a careless girl.",
    "Never cleared the\ncoffeecups away last night.",
    "That\u2019s what happens when I\u2019m not here to\nlook after things.\u201d\n\nPoirot lifted his hand.",

    "\u201cI have been admiring these flower beds.",
    "How\nmany gardeners are employed here by the way\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly three now sir.",
    "Five we had before the war when it was kept as\na gentleman\u2019s place should be.",
    "I wish you could have seen it then sir.",
    "A fair sight it was.",
    "But now there\u2019s only old Manning and young\nWilliam and a newfashioned woman gardener in breeches and suchlike.",
    "Ah these are dreadful times\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good times will come again Dorcas.",
    "At least we hope so.",
    "Now\nwill you send Annie to me here\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "Thank you sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders\u201d I asked\nin lively curiosity as Dorcas left the room.",
    "\u201cAnd about the lost key\nand the duplicate\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing at a time.",
    "As to the sleeping powders I knew by this.\u201d He\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box such as chemists use for\npowders.",
    "\u201cWhere did you find it\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the washstand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s bedroom.",
    "It was Number\nSix of my catalogue.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I suppose as the last powder was taken two days ago it is not of\nmuch importance\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\nabout this box\u201d\n\nI examined it closely.",
    "\u201cNo I can\u2019t say that I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at the label.\u201d\n\nI read the label carefully \u201c\u2018One powder to be taken at bedtime if\nrequired.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp.\u2019 No I see nothing unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the fact that there is no chemist\u2019s name\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cTo be sure that is odd\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that without his\nprinted name\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I can\u2019t say that I have.\u201d\n\nI was becoming quite excited but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking\n\n\u201cYet the explanation is quite simple.",
    "So do not intrigue yourself my\nfriend.\u201d\n\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie so I had no time\nto reply.",
    "Annie was a fine strapping girl and was evidently labouring under\nintense excitement mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\ntragedy.",
    "Poirot came to the point at once with a businesslike briskness.",
    "\u201cI sent for you Annie because I thought you might be able to tell me\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night.",
    "How many\nwere there And can you tell me any of the names and addresses\u201d\n\nAnnie considered.",
    "\u201cThere were four letters sir.",
    "One was to Miss Howard and one was to\nMr. Wells the lawyer and the other two I don\u2019t think I remember\nsir\u2014oh yes one was to Ross\u2019s the caterers in Tadminster.",
    "The other\none I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink\u201d urged Poirot.",

    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir but it\u2019s clean gone.",
    "I don\u2019t think I can have noticed\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not matter\u201d said Poirot not betraying any sign of\ndisappointment.",
    "\u201cNow I want to ask you about something else.",
    "There is a\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room with some cocoa in it.",
    "Did she have\nthat every night\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir it was put in her room every evening and she warmed it up\nin the night\u2014whenever she fancied it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it Plain cocoa\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir made with milk with a teaspoonful of sugar and two\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho took it to her room\u201d\n\n\u201cI did sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt what time\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I went to draw the curtains as a rule sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you bring it straight up from the kitchen then\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir you see there\u2019s not much room on the gas stove so cook used\nto make it early before putting the vegetables on for supper.",
    "Then I\nused to bring it up and put it on the table by the swing door and\ntake it into her room later.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe swing door is in the left wing is it not\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the table is it on this side of the door or on the\nfarther\u2014servants\u2019 side\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this side sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat time did you bring it up last night\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout quarterpast seven I should say sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I went to shut up sir.",
    "About eight o\u2019clock.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp came\nup to bed before I\u2019d finished.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen between sevenfifteen and eight o\u2019clock the cocoa was standing\non the table in the left wing\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face and\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly\n\n\u201cAnd if there was salt in it sir it wasn\u2019t me.",
    "I never took the\nsalt near it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think there was salt in it\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cSeeing it on the tray sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw some salt on the tray\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Coarse kitchen salt it looked.",
    "I never noticed it when I took\nthe tray up but when I came to take it into the mistress\u2019s room I saw\nit at once and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again and\nasked cook to make some fresh.",
    "But I was in a hurry because Dorcas was\nout and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right and the salt\nhad only gone on the tray.",
    "So I dusted it off with my apron and took\nit in.\u201d\n\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement.",
    "Unknown to\nherself Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence.",
    "How\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her \u201ccoarse kitchen salt\u201d\nwas strychnine one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind.",
    "I\nmarvelled at Poirot\u2019s calm.",
    "His selfcontrol was astonishing.",
    "I awaited\nhis next question with impatience but it disappointed me.",
    "\u201cWhen you went into Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room was the door leading into\nMiss Cynthia\u2019s room bolted\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Yes sir it always was.",
    "It had never been opened.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the door into Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s room Did you notice if that was\nbolted too\u201d\n\nAnnie hesitated.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t rightly say sir it was shut but I couldn\u2019t say whether it\nwas bolted or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you finally left the room did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\nafter you\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir not then but I expect she did later.",
    "She usually did lock it\nat night.",
    "The door into the passage that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\nyesterday\u201d\n\n\u201cCandle grease Oh no sir.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp didn\u2019t have a candle only\na readinglamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir and I would have taken it out with a piece of blottingpaper\nand a hot iron.\u201d\n\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas\n\n\u201cDid your mistress ever have a green dress\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor a mantle nor a cape nor a\u2014how do you call it\u2014a sports coat\u201d\n\n\u201cNot green sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor anyone else in the house\u201d\n\nAnnie reflected.",
    "\u201cNo sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure of that\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBien That is all I want to know.",
    "Thank you very much.\u201d\n\nWith a nervous giggle Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.",
    "My pentup excitement burst forth.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried \u201cI congratulate you This is a great discovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a great discovery\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned.",
    "That\nexplains everything Of course it did not take effect until the early\nmorning since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you think that the cocoa\u2014mark well what I say Hastings the\ncocoa\u2014contained strychnine\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course That salt on the tray what else could it have been\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might have been salt\u201d replied Poirot placidly.",
    "I shrugged my shoulders.",
    "If he was going to take the matter that way\nit was no good arguing with him.",
    "The idea crossed my mind not for the\nfirst time that poor old Poirot was growing old.",
    "Privately I thought\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\ntype of mind.",
    "Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.",
    "\u201cYou are not pleased with me mon ami\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Poirot\u201d I said coldly \u201cit is not for me to dictate to you.",
    "You have a right to your own opinion just as I have to mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cA most admirable sentiment\u201d remarked Poirot rising briskly to his\nfeet.",
    "\u201cNow I have finished with this room.",
    "By the way whose is the\nsmaller desk in the corner\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Inglethorp\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d He tried the roll top tentatively.",
    "\u201cLocked.",
    "But perhaps one of\nMrs. Inglethorp\u2019s keys would open it.\u201d He tried several twisting and\nturning them with a practiced hand and finally uttering an ejaculation\nof satisfaction.",
    "\u201cVoil\u00e0 It is not the key but it will open it at a\npinch.\u201d He slid back the roll top and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\nfiled papers.",
    "To my surprise he did not examine them merely remarking\napprovingly as he relocked the desk \u201cDecidedly he is a man of method\nthis Mr. Inglethorp\u201d\n\nA \u201cman of method\u201d was in Poirot\u2019s estimation the highest praise that\ncould be bestowed on any individual.",
    "I felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\ndisconnectedly\n\n\u201cThere were no stamps in his desk but there might have been eh mon\nami There might have been Yes\u201d\u2014his eyes wandered round the\nroom\u2014\u201cthis boudoir has nothing more to tell us.",
    "It did not yield much.",
    "Only this.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket and tossed it over to\nme.",
    "It was rather a curious document.",
    "A plain dirty looking old\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it apparently at random.",
    "The\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.",
    "Illustration\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\u201cIT ISN\u2019T STRYCHNINE IS IT\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere did you find this\u201d I asked Poirot in lively curiosity.",
    "\u201cIn the wastepaper basket.",
    "You recognise the handwriting\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it is Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s.",
    "But what does it mean\u201d\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cI cannot say\u2014but it is suggestive.\u201d\n\nA wild idea flashed across me.",
    "Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\nmind was deranged Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\npossession And if that were so was it not also possible that she\nmight have taken her own life\n\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot when his own words\ndistracted me.",
    "\u201cCome\u201d he said \u201cnow to examine the coffeecups\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Poirot What on earth is the good of that now that we know\nabout the cocoa\u201d\n\n\u201cOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0 That miserable cocoa\u201d cried Poirot flippantly.",
    "He laughed with apparent enjoyment raising his arms to heaven in mock\ndespair in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.",
    "\u201cAnd anyway\u201d I said with increasing coldness \u201cas Mrs. Inglethorp\ntook her coffee upstairs with her I do not see what you expect to\nfind unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\nstrychnine on the coffee tray\u201d\n\nPoirot was sobered at once.",
    "\u201cCome come my friend\u201d he said slipping his arms through mine.",
    "\u201cNe\nvous f\u00e2chez pas Allow me to interest myself in my coffeecups and I\nwill respect your cocoa.",
    "There Is it a bargain\u201d\n\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh and we went\ntogether to the drawingroom where the coffeecups and tray remained\nundisturbed as we had left them.",
    "Poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before listening\nvery carefully and verifying the position of the various cups.",
    "\u201cSo Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray\u2014and poured out.",
    "Yes.",
    "Then she came\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia.",
    "Yes.",
    "Here\nare the three cups.",
    "And the cup on the mantelpiece half drunk that\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\u2019s.",
    "And the one on the tray\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn Cavendish\u2019s.",
    "I saw him put it down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.",
    "One two three four five\u2014but where then is the cup of Mr.\nInglethorp\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does not take coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen all are accounted for.",
    "One moment my friend.\u201d\n\nWith infinite care he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup\nsealing them up in separate test tubes tasting each in turn as he did\nso.",
    "His physiognomy underwent a curious change.",
    "An expression gathered\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled and half relieved.",
    "\u201cBien\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cIt is evident I had an idea\u2014but clearly I\nwas mistaken.",
    "Yes altogether I was mistaken.",
    "Yet it is strange.",
    "But no\nmatter\u201d\n\nAnd with a characteristic shrug he dismissed whatever it was that was\nworrying him from his mind.",
    "I could have told him from the beginning\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\nalley but I restrained my tongue.",
    "After all though he was old Poirot\nhad been a great man in his day.",
    "\u201cBreakfast is ready\u201d said John Cavendish coming in from the hall.",
    "\u201cYou will breakfast with us Monsieur Poirot\u201d\n\nPoirot acquiesced.",
    "I observed John.",
    "Already he was almost restored to\nhis normal self.",
    "The shock of the events of the last night had upset\nhim temporarily but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.",
    "He was a man of very little imagination in sharp contrast with his\nbrother who had perhaps too much.",
    "Ever since the early hours of the morning John had been hard at work\nsending telegrams\u2014one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard\u2014writing\nnotices for the papers and generally occupying himself with the\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.",
    "\u201cMay I ask how things are proceeding\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDo your investigations\npoint to my mother having died a natural death\u2014or\u2014or must we prepare\nourselves for the worst\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Mr. Cavendish\u201d said Poirot gravely \u201cthat you would do well\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes.",
    "Can you tell me the views\nof the other members of the family\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\nnothing.",
    "He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\nheart failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does does he That is very interesting\u2014very interesting\u201d murmured\nPoirot softly.",
    "\u201cAnd Mrs. Cavendish\u201d\n\nA faint cloud passed over John\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cI have not the least idea what my wife\u2019s views on the subject are.\u201d\n\nThe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train.",
    "John broke the\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort\n\n\u201cI told you didn\u2019t I that Mr. Inglethorp has returned\u201d\n\nPoirot bent his head.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s an awkward position for all of us.",
    "Of course one has to treat him\nas usual\u2014but hang it all one\u2019s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\nwith a possible murderer\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.",
    "\u201cI quite understand.",
    "It is a very difficult situation for you Mr.\nCavendish.",
    "I would like to ask you one question.",
    "Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s\nreason for not returning last night was I believe that he had\nforgotten the latchkey.",
    "Is not that so\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose you are quite sure that the latchkey was forgotten\u2014that\nhe did not take it after all\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea.",
    "I never thought of looking.",
    "We always keep it in the\nhall drawer.",
    "I\u2019ll go and see if it\u2019s there now.\u201d\n\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.",
    "\u201cNo no Mr. Cavendish it is too late now.",
    "I am certain that you would\nfind it.",
    "If Mr. Inglethorp did take it he has had ample time to\nreplace it by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut do you think\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think nothing.",
    "If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\nreturn and seen it there it would have been a valuable point in his\nfavour.",
    "That is all.\u201d\n\nJohn looked perplexed.",
    "\u201cDo not worry\u201d said Poirot smoothly.",
    "\u201cI assure you that you need not\nlet it trouble you.",
    "Since you are so kind let us go and have some\nbreakfast.\u201d\n\nEveryone was assembled in the diningroom.",
    "Under the circumstances we\nwere naturally not a cheerful party.",
    "The reaction after a shock is\nalways trying and I think we were all suffering from it.",
    "Decorum and\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\nusual yet I could not help wondering if this selfcontrol were really\na matter of great difficulty.",
    "There were no red eyes no signs of\nsecretly indulged grief.",
    "I felt that I was right in my opinion that\nDorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\ntragedy.",
    "I pass over Alfred Inglethorp who acted the bereaved widower in a\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy.",
    "Did he know that\nwe suspected him I wondered.",
    "Surely he could not be unaware of the\nfact conceal it as we would.",
    "Did he feel some secret stirring of fear\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished Surely the\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\nman.",
    "But did everyone suspect him What about Mrs. Cavendish I watched her\nas she sat at the head of the table graceful composed enigmatic.",
    "In\nher soft grey frock with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\nslender hands she looked very beautiful.",
    "When she chose however her\nface could be sphinxlike in its inscrutability.",
    "She was very silent\nhardly opening her lips and yet in some queer way I felt that the\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.",
    "And little Cynthia Did she suspect She looked very tired and ill I\nthought.",
    "The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked.",
    "I\nasked her if she were feeling ill and she answered frankly\n\n\u201cYes I\u2019ve got the most beastly headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave another cup of coffee mademoiselle\u201d said Poirot solicitously.",
    "\u201cIt will revive you.",
    "It is unparalleled for the mal de t\u00eate.\u201d He\njumped up and took her cup.",
    "\u201cNo sugar\u201d said Cynthia watching him as he picked up the\nsugartongs.",
    "\u201cNo sugar You abandon it in the wartime eh\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I never take it in coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cSacr\u00e9\u201d murmured Poirot to himself as he brought back the\nreplenished cup.",
    "Only I heard him and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement and his eyes were\nas green as a cat\u2019s.",
    "He had heard or seen something that had affected\nhim strongly\u2014but what was it I do not usually label myself as dense\nbut I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted my\nattention.",
    "In another moment the door opened and Dorcas appeared.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Wells to see you sir\u201d she said to John.",
    "I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\nInglethorp had written the night before.",
    "John rose immediately.",
    "\u201cShow him into my study.\u201d Then he turned to us.",
    "\u201cMy mother\u2019s lawyer\u201d\nhe explained.",
    "And in a lower voice \u201cHe is also Coroner\u2014you understand.",
    "Perhaps you would like to come with me\u201d\n\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room.",
    "John strode on ahead\nand I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot\n\n\u201cThere will be an inquest then\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded absently.",
    "He seemed absorbed in thought so much so that\nmy curiosity was aroused.",
    "\u201cWhat is it You are not attending to what I say.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true my friend.",
    "I am much worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat You cannot be serious\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am most serious.",
    "Ah there is something there that I do not\nunderstand.",
    "My instinct was right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat instinct\u201d\n\n\u201cThe instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffeecups.",
    "Chut no more now\u201d\n\nWe followed John into his study and he closed the door behind us.",
    "Mr. Wells was a pleasant man of middleage with keen eyes and the\ntypical lawyer\u2019s mouth.",
    "John introduced us both and explained the\nreason of our presence.",
    "\u201cYou will understand Wells\u201d he added \u201cthat this is all strictly\nprivate.",
    "We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\ninvestigation of any kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so quite so\u201d said Mr. Wells soothingly.",
    "\u201cI wish we could have\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest but of course it\u2019s\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor\u2019s certificate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I suppose so.\u201d\n\n\u201cClever man Bauerstein.",
    "Great authority on toxicology I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed\u201d said John with a certain stiffness in his manner.",
    "Then he\nadded rather hesitatingly \u201cShall we have to appear as witnesses\u2014all of\nus I mean\u201d\n\n\u201cYou of course\u2014and ah\u2014er\u2014Mr.\u2014er\u2014Inglethorp.\u201d\n\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner\n\n\u201cAny other evidence will be simply confirmatory a mere matter of\nform.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\nA faint expression of relief swept over John\u2019s face.",
    "It puzzled me for\nI saw no occasion for it.",
    "\u201cIf you know of nothing to the contrary\u201d pursued Mr. Wells \u201cI had\nthought of Friday.",
    "That will give us plenty of time for the doctor\u2019s\nreport.",
    "The postmortem is to take place tonight I believe\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that arrangement will suit you\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need not tell you my dear Cavendish how distressed I am at this\nmost tragic affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you give us no help in solving it monsieur\u201d interposed Poirot\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.",
    "\u201cI\u201d\n\n\u201cYes we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night.",
    "You should\nhave received the letter this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did but it contains no information.",
    "It is merely a note asking me\nto call upon her this morning as she wanted my advice on a matter of\ngreat importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe gave you no hint as to what that matter might be\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately no.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a pity\u201d said John.",
    "\u201cA great pity\u201d agreed Poirot gravely.",
    "There was silence.",
    "Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.",
    "Finally he turned to the lawyer again.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Wells there is one thing I should like to ask you\u2014that is if it\nis not against professional etiquette.",
    "In the event of Mrs.\nInglethorp\u2019s death who would inherit her money\u201d\n\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment and then replied\n\n\u201cThe knowledge will be public property very soon so if Mr. Cavendish\ndoes not object\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all\u201d interpolated John.",
    "\u201cI do not see any reason why I should not answer your question.",
    "By her\nlast will dated August of last year after various unimportant\nlegacies to servants etc.",
    "she gave her entire fortune to her stepson\nMr. John Cavendish.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas not that\u2014pardon the question Mr. Cavendish\u2014rather unfair to her\nother stepson Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I do not think so.",
    "You see under the terms of their father\u2019s\nwill while John inherited the property Lawrence at his stepmother\u2019s\ndeath would come into a considerable sum of money.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp\nleft her money to her elder stepson knowing that he would have to keep\nup Styles.",
    "It was to my mind a very fair and equitable distribution.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI see.",
    "But I am right in saying am I not that by your English law\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried\u201d\n\nMr. Wells bowed his head.",
    "\u201cAs I was about to proceed Monsieur Poirot that document is now null\nand void.\u201d\n\n\u201cHein\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He reflected for a moment and then asked \u201cWas\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know.",
    "She may have been.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was\u201d said John unexpectedly.",

    "Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\nto Mr. Wells and myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich simplifies matters very much\u201d murmured the lawyer.",

    "The gardener glanced at his master who nodded whereupon Manning\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble and backed\ncautiously out of the window.",

    "Ask cook if she\u2019s missed any.\u201d\n\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof and keep the peace\nbetween them was likely to prove a Herculean task and I did not envy\nJohn.",
    "I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\nappreciated the difficulty of the position.",

    "I will tell you why.",

    "I watched over her.",
    "I guarded her from the lot of them and then a\nglibtongued scoundrel comes along and pooh all my years of devotion\ngo for nothing.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.",

    "It is most\nnatural.",
    "You think that we are lukewarm\u2014that we lack fire and\nenergy\u2014but trust me it is not so.\u201d\n\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture and invited us both to come up\nto Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.",

    "Why Ah if I only knew.",
    "When Since I was\nhere an hour ago.",
    "As to the door being locked it is a very ordinary\nlock.",
    "Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.\u201d\n\nWe stared at one another blankly.",
    "Poirot had walked over to the\nmantelpiece.",
    "He was outwardly calm but I noticed his hands which from\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\nthe mantelpiece were shaking violently.",
    "\u201cSee here it was like this\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cThere was something in\nthat case\u2014some piece of evidence slight in itself perhaps but still\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime.",
    "It was vital\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\nsignificance appreciated.",
    "Therefore he took the risk the great risk\nof coming in here.",
    "Finding the case locked he was obliged to force it\nthus betraying his presence.",
    "For him to take that risk it must have\nbeen something of great importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what was it\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d cried Poirot with a gesture of anger.",

    "I really did\nnot know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose.",
    "As I saw a faint\nsmile gather on Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s expressive mouth I endeavoured to try\nand turn the conversation by saying \u201cThey haven\u2019t met yet have they\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",

    "Once again I could not help regretting that my\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement.",
    "I\nstepped briskly down the stairs.",
    "The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\nimmediately.",
    "I drew him aside.",
    "\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d I said \u201cis this wise Surely you don\u2019t want the\nwhole house to know of this occurrence You are actually playing into\nthe criminal\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so Hastings\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell well my friend I will be guided by you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.",
    "Although unfortunately it is a little too late now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry though I\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d he said at last \u201clet us go mon ami.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have finished here\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the moment yes.",
    "You will walk back with me to the village\u201d\n\n\u201cWillingly.\u201d\n\nHe picked up his little suitcase and we went out through the open\nwindow in the drawingroom.",
    "Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in and\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.",
    "\u201cExcuse me mademoiselle one minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d she turned inquiringly.",
    "\u201cDid you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s medicines\u201d\n\nA slight flush rose in her face as she answered rather constrainedly\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly her powders\u201d\n\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied\n\n\u201cOh yes I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese\u201d\n\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.",
    "She nodded.",
    "\u201cCan you tell me what they were Sulphonal Veronal\u201d\n\n\u201cNo they were bromide powders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh Thank you mademoiselle good morning.\u201d\n\nAs we walked briskly away from the house I glanced at him more than\nonce.",
    "I had often before noticed that if anything excited him his\neyes turned green like a cat\u2019s.",
    "They were shining like emeralds now.",
    "\u201cMy friend\u201d he broke out at last \u201cI have a little idea a very\nstrange and probably utterly impossible idea.",
    "And yet\u2014it fits in.\u201d\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.",
    "I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas.",
    "In this case surely the truth\nwas only too plain and apparent.",
    "\u201cSo that is the explanation of the blank label on the box\u201d I remarked.",
    "\u201cVery simple as you said.",
    "I really wonder that I did not think of it\nmyself.\u201d\n\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.",
    "\u201cThey have made one more discovery l\u00e0bas\u201d he observed jerking his\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Wells told me\nas we were going upstairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it\u201d\n\n\u201cLocked up in the desk in the boudoir they found a will of Mrs.\nInglethorp\u2019s dated before her marriage leaving her fortune to Alfred\nInglethorp.",
    "It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.",
    "It came quite as a surprise to Wells\u2014and to John Cavendish also.",
    "It was\nwritten on one of those printed will forms and witnessed by two of the\nservants\u2014not Dorcas.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Mr. Inglethorp know of it\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says not.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne might take that with a grain of salt\u201d I remarked sceptically.",
    "\u201cAll these wills are very confusing.",
    "Tell me how did those scribbled\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\nyesterday afternoon\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cMon ami have you ever when writing a letter been arrested by the\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word\u201d\n\n\u201cYes often.",
    "I suppose everyone has.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.",
    "And have you not in such a case tried the word once or\ntwice on the edge of the blottingpaper or a spare scrap of paper to\nsee if it looked right Well that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did.",
    "You\nwill notice that the word \u2018possessed\u2019 is spelt first with one \u2018s\u2019 and\nsubsequently with two\u2014correctly.",
    "To make sure she had further tried it\nin a sentence thus \u2018I am possessed.\u2019 Now what did that tell me It\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word \u2018possessed\u2019 that\nafternoon and having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\nin my mind the possibility of a will\u2014a document almost certain to\ncontain that word\u2014occurred to me at once.",
    "This possibility was\nconfirmed by a further circumstance.",
    "In the general confusion the\nboudoir had not been swept that morning and near the desk were several\ntraces of brown mould and earth.",
    "The weather had been perfectly fine\nfor some days and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\ndeposit.",
    "\u201cI strolled to the window and saw at once that the begonia beds had\nbeen newly planted.",
    "The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\non the floor of the boudoir and also I learnt from you that they had\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon.",
    "I was now sure that one or possibly\nboth of the gardeners\u2014for there were two sets of footprints in the\nbed\u2014had entered the boudoir for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window\nand they would not have come into the room at all.",
    "I was now quite\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will and had called the two\ngardeners in to witness her signature.",
    "Events proved that I was right\nin my supposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was very ingenious\u201d I could not help admitting.",
    "\u201cI must confess\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\nerroneous.\u201d\n\nHe smiled.",
    "\u201cYou gave too much rein to your imagination.",
    "Imagination is a good\nservant and a bad master.",
    "The simplest explanation is always the most\nlikely.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother point\u2014how did you know that the key of the despatchcase had\nbeen lost\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not know it.",
    "It was a guess that turned out to be correct.",
    "You\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle.",
    "That\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\nkeyring.",
    "Now if it had been lost and recovered Mrs. Inglethorp would\nat once have replaced it on her bunch but on her bunch I found what\nwas obviously the duplicate key very new and bright which led me to\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\nlock of the despatchcase.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d I said \u201cAlfred Inglethorp without doubt.\u201d\n\nPoirot looked at me curiously.",
    "\u201cYou are very sure of his guilt\u201d\n\n\u201cWell naturally.",
    "Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\nclearly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary\u201d said Poirot quietly \u201cthere are several points in\nhis favour.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come now\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see only one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u201d\n\n\u201cThat he was not in the house last night.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Bad shot\u2019 as you English say You have chosen the one point that to\nmy mind tells against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is that\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\nnight he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house.",
    "His\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one.",
    "That leaves us two\npossibilities either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\nreason of his own for his absence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that reason\u201d I asked sceptically.",
    "Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cHow should I know Discreditable without doubt.",
    "This Mr. Inglethorp\nI should say is somewhat of a scoundrel\u2014but that does not of necessity\nmake him a murderer.\u201d\n\nI shook my head unconvinced.",
    "\u201cWe do not agree eh\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cWell let us leave it.",
    "Time will\nshow which of us is right.",
    "Now let us turn to other aspects of the\ncase.",
    "What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\nwere bolted on the inside\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u2014\u201d I considered.",
    "\u201cOne must look at it logically.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should put it this way.",
    "The doors were bolted\u2014our own eyes have\ntold us that\u2014yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor and\nthe destruction of the will prove that during the night someone\nentered the room.",
    "You agree so far\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfectly.",
    "Put with admirable clearness.",
    "Proceed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d I said encouraged \u201cas the person who entered did not do so by\nthe window nor by miraculous means it follows that the door must have\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself.",
    "That strengthens\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband.",
    "She would\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cWhy should she She had bolted the door leading into his room\u2014a most\nunusual proceeding on her part\u2014she had had a most violent quarrel with\nhim that very afternoon.",
    "No he was the last person she would admit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\nInglethorp herself\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is another possibility.",
    "She may have forgotten to bolt the door\ninto the passage when she went to bed and have got up later towards\nmorning and bolted it then.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot is that seriously your opinion\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I do not say it is so but it might be.",
    "Now to turn to another\nfeature what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her motherinlaw\u201d\n\n\u201cI had forgotten that\u201d I said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThat is as enigmatical as\never.",
    "It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish proud and\nreticent to the last degree should interfere so violently in what was\ncertainly not her affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.",
    "It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\ndo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is certainly curious\u201d I agreed.",
    "\u201cStill it is unimportant and\nneed not be taken into account.\u201d\n\nA groan burst from Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat have I always told you Everything must be taken into account.",
    "If\nthe fact will not fit the theory\u2014let the theory go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we shall see\u201d I said nettled.",
    "\u201cYes we shall see.\u201d\n\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\nown room.",
    "He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\noccasionally smoked.",
    "I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot.",
    "My momentary\nannoyance vanished.",
    "Poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\ncommanded a view of the village street.",
    "The fresh air blew in warm and\npleasant.",
    "It was going to be a hot day.",
    "Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\ndown the street at a great pace.",
    "It was the expression on his face that\nwas extraordinary\u2014a curious mingling of terror and agitation.",
    "\u201cLook Poirot\u201d I said.",
    "He leant forward.",
    "\u201cTiens\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt is Mr. Mace from the chemist\u2019s shop.",
    "He is\ncoming here.\u201d\n\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage and after\nhesitating a moment pounded vigorously at the door.",
    "\u201cA little minute\u201d cried Poirot from the window.",
    "\u201cI come.\u201d\n\nMotioning to me to follow him he ran swiftly down the stairs and\nopened the door.",
    "Mr. Mace began at once.",
    "\u201cOh Mr. Poirot I\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience but I heard that\nyou\u2019d just come back from the Hall\u201d\n\n\u201cYes we have.\u201d\n\nThe young man moistened his dry lips.",
    "His face was working curiously.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.",
    "They do say\u2014\u201d he lowered his voice cautiously\u2014\u201cthat it\u2019s poison\u201d\n\nPoirot\u2019s face remained quite impassive.",
    "\u201cOnly the doctors can tell us that Mr. Mace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes exactly\u2014of course\u2014\u2014\u201d The young man hesitated and then his\nagitation was too much for him.",
    "He clutched Poirot by the arm and sank\nhis voice to a whisper \u201cJust tell me this Mr. Poirot it isn\u2019t\u2014it\nisn\u2019t strychnine is it\u201d\n\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied.",
    "Something evidently of a\nnoncommittal nature.",
    "The young man departed and as he closed the door\nPoirot\u2019s eyes met mine.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said nodding gravely.",
    "\u201cHe will have evidence to give at the\ninquest.\u201d\n\nWe went slowly upstairs again.",
    "I was opening my lips when Poirot\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.",
    "\u201cNot now not now mon ami.",
    "I have need of reflection.",
    "My mind is in\nsome disorder\u2014which is not well.\u201d\n\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence perfectly still except\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows and all the time his\neyes grew steadily greener.",
    "At last he heaved a deep sigh.",
    "\u201cIt is well.",
    "The bad moment has passed.",
    "Now all is arranged and\nclassified.",
    "One must never permit confusion.",
    "The case is not clear\nyet\u2014no.",
    "For it is of the most complicated It puzzles me.",
    "Me\nHercule Poirot There are two facts of significance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are they\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first is the state of the weather yesterday.",
    "That is very\nimportant.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it was a glorious day\u201d I interrupted.",
    "\u201cPoirot you\u2019re pulling my\nleg\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all.",
    "The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade.",
    "Do not\nforget that my friend.",
    "It is the key to the whole riddle\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the second point\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cThe important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\nclothes has a black beard and uses glasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot I cannot believe you are serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am absolutely serious my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is childish\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it is very momentous.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd supposing the Coroner\u2019s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp.",
    "What becomes of your theories then\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\nmake a mistake But that will not occur.",
    "For one thing a country jury\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself and Mr. Inglethorp\nstands practically in the position of local squire.",
    "Also\u201d he added\nplacidly \u201cI should not allow it\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would not allow it\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nI looked at the extraordinary little man divided between annoyance and\namusement.",
    "He was so tremendously sure of himself.",
    "As though he read my\nthoughts he nodded gently.",
    "\u201cOh yes mon ami I would do what I say.\u201d He got up and laid his\nhand on my shoulder.",
    "His physiognomy underwent a complete change.",
    "Tears\ncame into his eyes.",
    "\u201cIn all this you see I think of that poor Mrs.\nInglethorp who is dead.",
    "She was not extravagantly loved\u2014no.",
    "But she was\nvery good to us Belgians\u2014I owe her a debt.\u201d\n\nI endeavoured to interrupt but Poirot swept on.",
    "\u201cLet me tell you this Hastings.",
    "She would never forgive me if I let\nAlfred Inglethorp her husband be arrested now\u2014when a word from me\ncould save him\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.",
    "THE INQUEST\n\n\nIn the interval before the inquest Poirot was unfailing in his\nactivity.",
    "Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells.",
    "He also took long walks\ninto the country.",
    "I rather resented his not taking me into his\nconfidence the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\ndriving at.",
    "It occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes\u2019s\nfarm so finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\nWednesday evening I walked over there by the fields hoping to meet\nhim.",
    "But there was no sign of him and I hesitated to go right up to\nthe farm itself.",
    "As I walked away I met an aged rustic who leered at\nme cunningly.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019m from the Hall bain\u2019t you\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "I\u2019m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\nthis way.\u201d\n\n\u201cA little chap As waves his hands when he talks One of them Belgies\nfrom the village\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d I said eagerly.",
    "\u201cHe has been here then\u201d\n\n\u201cOh ay he\u2019s been here right enough.",
    "More\u2019n once too.",
    "Friend of\nyours is he Ah you gentlemen from the Hall\u2014you\u2019m a pretty lot\u201d And\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.",
    "\u201cWhy do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often\u201d I asked as\ncarelessly as I could.",
    "He winked at me knowingly.",
    "\u201cOne does mister.",
    "Naming no names mind.",
    "And a very liberal\ngentleman too Oh thank you sir I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nI walked on sharply.",
    "Evelyn Howard had been right then and I\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust as I thought of Alfred\nInglethorp\u2019s liberality with another woman\u2019s money.",
    "Had that piquant\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime or was it the baser\nmainspring of money Probably a judicious mixture of both.",
    "On one point Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession.",
    "He once or\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\nfixing the time of the quarrel.",
    "He suggested to her repeatedly that it\nwas fourthirty and not four o\u2019clock when she had heard the voices.",
    "But Dorcas was unshaken.",
    "Quite an hour or even more had elapsed\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o\u2019clock when\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.",
    "The inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.",
    "Poirot and I sat together not being required to give evidence.",
    "The preliminaries were gone through.",
    "The jury viewed the body and John\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.",
    "Further questioned he described his awakening in the early hours of\nthe morning and the circumstances of his mother\u2019s death.",
    "The medical evidence was next taken.",
    "There was a breathless hush and\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist who was known to\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\ntoxicology.",
    "In a few brief words he summed up the result of the postmortem.",
    "Shorn\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities it amounted to the fact\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\npoisoning.",
    "Judging from the quantity recovered she must have taken not\nless than threequarters of a grain of strychnine but probably one\ngrain or slightly over.",
    "\u201cIs it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident\u201d\nasked the Coroner.",
    "\u201cI should consider it very unlikely.",
    "Strychnine is not used for\ndomestic purposes as some poisons are and there are restrictions\nplaced on its sale.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\nwas administered\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins I believe\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so.",
    "The motor met me just outside the lodge gates and I\nhurried there as fast as I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you relate to us exactly what happened next\u201d\n\n\u201cI entered Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room.",
    "She was at that moment in a typical\ntetanic convulsion.",
    "She turned towards me and gasped out\n\u2018Alfred\u2014Alfred\u2014\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCould the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\nafterdinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action.",
    "The\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed.",
    "It\nis retarded under certain conditions none of which however appear to\nhave been present in this case.",
    "I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\ncoffee after dinner about eight o\u2019clock whereas the symptoms did not\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning which on the\nface of it points to the drug having been taken much later in the\nevening.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\nmiddle of the night.",
    "Could the strychnine have been administered in\nthat\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\nhad it analysed.",
    "There was no strychnine present.\u201d\n\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.",
    "\u201cHow did you know\u201d I whispered.",
    "\u201cListen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should say\u201d\u2014the doctor was continuing\u2014\u201cthat I would have been\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste.",
    "It can be\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand and can only be\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance.",
    "Cocoa would be quite\npowerless to mask it.\u201d\n\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\nthe taste of strychnine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\ncoffee but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but the cup being completely smashed there is no possibility of\nanalyzing its contents.\u201d\n\nThis concluded Dr. Bauerstein\u2019s evidence.",
    "Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\non all points.",
    "Sounded as to the possibility of suicide he repudiated\nit utterly.",
    "The deceased he said suffered from a weak heart but\notherwise enjoyed perfect health and was of a cheerful and\nwellbalanced disposition.",
    "She would be one of the last people to take\nher own life.",
    "Lawrence Cavendish was next called.",
    "His evidence was quite unimportant\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother.",
    "Just as he was about to\nstep down he paused and said rather hesitatingly\n\n\u201cI should like to make a suggestion if I may\u201d\n\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner who replied briskly\n\n\u201cCertainly Mr. Cavendish we are here to arrive at the truth of this\nmatter and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is just an idea of mine\u201d explained Lawrence.",
    "\u201cOf course I may be\nquite wrong but it still seems to me that my mother\u2019s death might be\naccounted for by natural means.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you make that out Mr. Cavendish\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother at the time of her death and for some time before it was\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said the Coroner.",
    "The jury looked up interested.",
    "\u201cI believe\u201d continued Lawrence \u201cthat there have been cases where the\ncumulative effect of a drug administered for some time has ended by\ncausing death.",
    "Also is it not possible that she may have taken an\noverdose of her medicine by accident\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\nthe time of her death.",
    "We are much obliged to you Mr. Cavendish.\u201d\n\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.",
    "\u201cWhat Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible.",
    "Any doctor would tell\nyou the same.",
    "Strychnine is in a certain sense a cumulative poison\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\nthis way.",
    "There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention.",
    "The whole thing is\nabsurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the second suggestion That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\ntaken an overdose\u201d\n\n\u201cThree or even four doses would not have resulted in death.",
    "Mrs.\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\ntime as she dealt with Coot\u2019s the Cash Chemists in Tadminster.",
    "She\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\namount of strychnine found at the postmortem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\nway instrumental in causing her death\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "The supposition is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.",
    "\u201cThat of course is always possible\u201d replied the doctor.",
    "But Dorcas who was the next witness called dispelled even that\npossibility.",
    "The medicine had not been newly made up.",
    "On the contrary\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.",
    "So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned and the Coroner\nproceeded with his task.",
    "Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress\u2019s bell and had\nsubsequently roused the household he passed to the subject of the\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.",
    "Dorcas\u2019s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\nalready heard so I will not repeat it here.",
    "The next witness was Mary Cavendish.",
    "She stood very upright and spoke\nin a low clear and perfectly composed voice.",
    "In answer to the\nCoroner\u2019s question she told how her alarm clock having aroused her at\nfourthirty as usual she was dressing when she was startled by the\nsound of something heavy falling.",
    "\u201cThat would have been the table by the bed\u201d commented the Coroner.",
    "\u201cI opened my door\u201d continued Mary \u201cand listened.",
    "In a few minutes a\nbell rang violently.",
    "Dorcas came running down and woke my husband and\nwe all went to my motherinlaw\u2019s room but it was locked\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nThe Coroner interrupted her.",
    "\u201cI really do not think we need trouble you further on that point.",
    "We\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings.",
    "But I should\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\nday before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u201d\n\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice.",
    "She raised her hand and\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck turning her head a little as\nshe did so.",
    "And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind\n\u201cShe is gaining time\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "I understand\u201d continued the Coroner deliberately \u201cthat you were\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\nboudoir.",
    "That is so is it not\u201d\n\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot I fancied that it\nwas news to him as well.",
    "There was the faintest pause the mere hesitation of a moment before\nshe answered\n\n\u201cYes that is so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the boudoir window was open was it not\u201d\n\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside especially as\nthey were raised in anger.",
    "In fact they would be more audible where\nyou were than in the hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel\u201d\n\n\u201cI really do not remember hearing anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean to say you did not hear voices\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes I heard the voices but I did not hear what they said.\u201d A\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek.",
    "\u201cI am not in the habit of\nlistening to private conversations.\u201d\n\nThe Coroner persisted.",
    "\u201cAnd you remember nothing at all Nothing Mrs. Cavendish Not one\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it was a private\nconversation\u201d\n\nShe paused and seemed to reflect still outwardly as calm as ever.",
    "\u201cYes I remember.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp said something\u2014I do not remember\nexactly what\u2014about causing scandal between husband and wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d the Coroner leant back satisfied.",
    "\u201cThat corresponds with what\nDorcas heard.",
    "But excuse me Mrs. Cavendish although you realized it\nwas a private conversation you did not move away You remained where\nyou were\u201d\n\nI caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them.",
    "I\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\nlittle lawyer with his insinuations into pieces but she replied\nquietly enough\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "I was very comfortable where I was.",
    "I fixed my mind on my book.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is all you can tell us\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is all.\u201d\n\nThe examination was over though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\nsatisfied with it.",
    "I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\nmore if she chose.",
    "Amy Hill shop assistant was next called and deposed to having sold a\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl undergardener\nat Styles.",
    "William Earl and Manning succeeded her and testified to witnessing a\ndocument.",
    "Manning fixed the time at about fourthirty William was of\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.",
    "Cynthia Murdoch came next.",
    "She had however little to tell.",
    "She had\nknown nothing of the tragedy until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.",
    "\u201cYou did not hear the table fall\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "I was fast asleep.\u201d\n\nThe Coroner smiled.",
    "\u201cA good conscience makes a sound sleeper\u201d he observed.",
    "\u201cThank you\nMiss Murdoch that is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Howard.\u201d\n\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\nthe evening of the 17th.",
    "Poirot and I had of course already seen it.",
    "It added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy.",
    "The following is a\nfacsimile\n\nSTYLES COURT\nESSEX\nhand written note\n\n     July 17th\n     My dear Evelyn\n     Can we not bury\n     the hachet I have\n     found it hard to forgive\n     the things you said\n     against my dear husband\n     but I am an old woman\n      very fond of you\n     Yours affectionately\n    Emily Inglethorpe\n\n\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.",
    "\u201cI fear it does not help us much\u201d said the Coroner with a sigh.",
    "\u201cThere is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlain as a pikestaff to me\u201d said Miss Howard shortly.",
    "\u201cIt shows\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she\u2019d been\nmade a fool of\u201d\n\n\u201cIt says nothing of the kind in the letter\u201d the Coroner pointed out.",
    "\u201cNo because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong.",
    "But\nI know her.",
    "She wanted me back.",
    "But she wasn\u2019t going to own that I\u2019d\nbeen right.",
    "She went round about.",
    "Most people do.",
    "Don\u2019t believe in it\nmyself.\u201d\n\nMr. Wells smiled faintly.",
    "So I noticed did several of the jury.",
    "Miss\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.",
    "\u201cAnyway all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time\u201d continued the\nlady glancing up and down the jury disparagingly.",
    "\u201cTalk\u2014talk\u2014talk\nWhen all the time we know perfectly well\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension\n\n\u201cThank you Miss Howard that is all.\u201d\n\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.",
    "Then came the sensation of the day.",
    "The Coroner called Albert Mace\nchemist\u2019s assistant.",
    "It was our agitated young man of the pale face.",
    "In answer to the\nCoroner\u2019s questions he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop as the assistant\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.",
    "These preliminaries completed the Coroner proceeded to business.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Mace have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was this\u201d\n\n\u201cLast Monday night.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonday Not Tuesday\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sir Monday the 16th.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you tell us to whom you sold it\u201d\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop.",
    "\u201cYes sir.",
    "It was to Mr. Inglethorp.\u201d\n\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting\nimpassive and wooden.",
    "He started slightly as the damning words fell\nfrom the young man\u2019s lips.",
    "I half thought he was going to rise from his\nchair but he remained seated although a remarkably well acted\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.",
    "\u201cYou are sure of what you say\u201d asked the Coroner sternly.",
    "\u201cQuite sure sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\ncounter\u201d\n\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner\u2019s frown.",
    "\u201cOh no sir\u2014of course not.",
    "But seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\nHall I thought there was no harm in it.",
    "He said it was to poison a\ndog.\u201d\n\nInwardly I sympathized.",
    "It was only human nature to endeavour to please\n\u201cThe Hall\u201d\u2014especially when it might result in custom being transferred\nfrom Coot\u2019s to the local establishment.",
    "\u201cIs it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir Mr. Inglethorp did so.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you got the book here\u201d\n\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\nIt was produced and with a few words of stern censure the Coroner\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.",
    "Then amidst a breathless silence Alfred Inglethorp was called.",
    "Did he\nrealize I wondered how closely the halter was being drawn around his\nneck\n\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.",
    "\u201cOn Monday evening last did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\npoisoning a dog\u201d\n\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness\n\n\u201cNo I did not.",
    "There is no dog at Styles except an outdoor sheepdog\nwhich is in perfect health.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\nMonday last\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you also deny this\u201d\n\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\ninscribed.",
    "\u201cCertainly I do.",
    "The handwriting is quite different from mine.",
    "I will\nshow you.\u201d\n\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket and wrote his name on it\nhanding it to the jury.",
    "It was certainly utterly dissimilar.",
    "\u201cThen what is your explanation of Mr. Mace\u2019s statement\u201d\n\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably\n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Mace must have been mistaken.\u201d\n\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment and then said\n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Inglethorp as a mere matter of form would you mind telling us\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday July 16th\u201d\n\n\u201cReally\u2014I cannot remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is absurd Mr. Inglethorp\u201d said the Coroner sharply.",
    "\u201cThink\nagain.\u201d\n\nInglethorp shook his head.",
    "\u201cI cannot tell you.",
    "I have an idea that I was out walking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what direction\u201d\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\nThe Coroner\u2019s face grew graver.",
    "\u201cWere you in company with anyone\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you meet anyone on your walk\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a pity\u201d said the Coroner dryly.",
    "\u201cI am to take it then that\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you like to take it that way yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful Mr. Inglethorp.\u201d\n\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.",
    "\u201cSacr\u00e9\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cDoes this imbecile of a man want to be\narrested\u201d\n\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression.",
    "His futile denials\nwould not have convinced a child.",
    "The Coroner however passed briskly\nto the next point and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.",
    "\u201cYou had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon me\u201d interrupted Alfred Inglethorp \u201cyou have been misinformed.",
    "I had no quarrel with my dear wife.",
    "The whole story is absolutely\nuntrue.",
    "I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you anyone who can testify to that\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have my word\u201d said Inglethorp haughtily.",
    "The Coroner did not trouble to reply.",
    "\u201cThere are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose witnesses were mistaken.\u201d\n\nI was puzzled.",
    "The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\nstaggered.",
    "I looked at Poirot.",
    "There was an expression of exultation on\nhis face which I could not understand.",
    "Was he at last convinced of\nAlfred Inglethorp\u2019s guilt\n\n\u201cMr.",
    "Inglethorp\u201d said the Coroner \u201cyou have heard your wife\u2019s dying\nwords repeated here.",
    "Can you explain them in any way\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to me very simple.",
    "The room was dimly lighted.",
    "Dr. Bauerstein\nis much of my height and build and like me wears a beard.",
    "In the dim\nlight and suffering as she was my poor wife mistook him for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d murmured Poirot to himself.",
    "\u201cBut it is an idea that\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think it is true\u201d I whispered.",
    "\u201cI do not say that.",
    "But it is truly an ingenious supposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou read my wife\u2019s last words as an accusation\u201d\u2014Inglethorp was\ncontinuing\u2014\u201cthey were on the contrary an appeal to me.\u201d\n\nThe Coroner reflected a moment then he said\n\n\u201cI believe Mr. Inglethorp that you yourself poured out the coffee\nand took it to your wife that evening\u201d\n\n\u201cI poured it out yes.",
    "But I did not take it to her.",
    "I meant to do so\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door so I laid down the\ncoffee on the hall table.",
    "When I came through the hall again a few\nminutes later it was gone.\u201d\n\nThis statement might or might not be true but it did not seem to me\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp.",
    "In any case he had had ample\ntime to introduce the poison.",
    "At that point Poirot nudged me gently indicating two men who were\nsitting together near the door.",
    "One was a little sharp dark\nferretfaced man the other was tall and fair.",
    "I questioned Poirot mutely.",
    "He put his lips to my ear.",
    "\u201cDo you know who that little man is\u201d\n\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cThat is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard\u2014Jimmy Japp.",
    "The other man is from Scotland Yard too.",
    "Things are moving quickly my\nfriend.\u201d\n\nI stared at the two men intently.",
    "There was certainly nothing of the\npoliceman about them.",
    "I should never have suspected them of being\nofficial personages.",
    "I was still staring when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\nbeing given\n\n\u201cWilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.",
    "POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS\n\n\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\npressure of the arm.",
    "I understood his object.",
    "He was waiting for the\nScotland Yard men.",
    "In a few moments they emerged and Poirot at once stepped forward and\naccosted the shorter of the two.",
    "\u201cI fear you do not remember me Inspector Japp.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy if it isn\u2019t Mr. Poirot\u201d cried the Inspector.",
    "He turned to the\nother man.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot It was in 1904 he and\nI worked together\u2014the Abercrombie forgery case\u2014you remember he was run\ndown in Brussels.",
    "Ah those were great days moosier.",
    "Then do you\nremember \u2018Baron\u2019 Altara There was a pretty rogue for you He eluded\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe.",
    "But we nailed him in\nAntwerp\u2014thanks to Mr. Poirot here.\u201d\n\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in I drew nearer\nand was introduced to DetectiveInspector Japp who in his turn\nintroduced us both to his companion Superintendent Summerhaye.",
    "\u201cI need hardly ask what you are doing here gentlemen\u201d remarked\nPoirot.",
    "Japp closed one eye knowingly.",
    "\u201cNo indeed.",
    "Pretty clear case I should say.\u201d\n\nBut Poirot answered gravely\n\n\u201cThere I differ from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come\u201d said Summerhaye opening his lips for the first time.",
    "\u201cSurely the whole thing is clear as daylight.",
    "The man\u2019s caught\nredhanded.",
    "How he could be such a fool beats me\u201d\n\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.",
    "\u201cHold your fire Summerhaye\u201d he remarked jocularly.",
    "\u201cMe and Moosier\nhere have met before\u2014and there\u2019s no man\u2019s judgment I\u2019d sooner take than\nhis.",
    "If I\u2019m not greatly mistaken he\u2019s got something up his sleeve.",
    "Isn\u2019t that so moosier\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cI have drawn certain conclusions\u2014yes.\u201d\n\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical but Japp continued his\nscrutiny of Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s this way\u201d he said \u201cso far we\u2019ve only seen the case from the\noutside.",
    "That\u2019s where the Yard\u2019s at a disadvantage in a case of this\nkind where the murder\u2019s only out so to speak after the inquest.",
    "A\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing and that\u2019s where Mr.\nPoirot\u2019s had the start of us.",
    "We shouldn\u2019t have been here as soon as\nthis even if it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\non the spot who gave us the tip through the Coroner.",
    "But you\u2019ve been\non the spot from the first and you may have picked up some little\nhints.",
    "From the evidence at the inquest Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\nwife as sure as I stand here and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\nI\u2019d laugh in his face.",
    "I must say I was surprised the jury didn\u2019t bring\nit in Wilful Murder against him right off.",
    "I think they would have if\nit hadn\u2019t been for the Coroner\u2014he seemed to be holding them back.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps though you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\nnow\u201d suggested Poirot.",
    "A kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp\u2019s\nexpressive countenance.",
    "\u201cPerhaps I have and perhaps I haven\u2019t\u201d he remarked dryly.",
    "Poirot looked at him thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI am very anxious Messieurs that he should not be arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dare say\u201d observed Summerhaye sarcastically.",
    "Japp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.",
    "\u201cCan\u2019t you go a little further Mr. Poirot A wink\u2019s as good as a\nnod\u2014from you.",
    "You\u2019ve been on the spot\u2014and the Yard doesn\u2019t want to make\nany mistakes you know.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded gravely.",
    "\u201cThat is exactly what I thought.",
    "Well I will tell you this.",
    "Use your\nwarrant Arrest Mr. Inglethorp.",
    "But it will bring you no kudos\u2014the case\nagainst him will be dismissed at once Comme \u00e7a\u201d And he snapped his\nfingers expressively.",
    "Japp\u2019s face grew grave though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.",
    "As for me I was literally dumb with astonishment.",
    "I could only\nconclude that Poirot was mad.",
    "Japp had taken out a handkerchief and was gently dabbing his brow.",
    "\u201cI daren\u2019t do it Mr. Poirot.",
    "I\u2019d take your word but there\u2019s others\nover me who\u2019ll be asking what the devil I mean by it.",
    "Can\u2019t you give me\na little more to go on\u201d\n\nPoirot reflected a moment.",
    "\u201cIt can be done\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cI admit I do not wish it.",
    "It forces\nmy hand.",
    "I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\npresent but what you say is very just\u2014the word of a Belgian policeman\nwhose day is past is not enough And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\narrested.",
    "That I have sworn as my friend Hastings here knows.",
    "See\nthen my good Japp you go at once to Styles\u201d\n\n\u201cWell in about half an hour.",
    "We\u2019re seeing the Coroner and the doctor\nfirst.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.",
    "Call for me in passing\u2014the last house in the village.",
    "I will go\nwith you.",
    "At Styles Mr. Inglethorp will give you or if he refuses\u2014as\nis probable\u2014I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained.",
    "Is that a bargain\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bargain\u201d said Japp heartily.",
    "\u201cAnd on behalf of the Yard\nI\u2019m much obliged to you though I\u2019m bound to confess I can\u2019t at present\nsee the faintest possible loophole in the evidence but you always\nwere a marvel So long then moosier.\u201d\n\nThe two detectives strode away Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\nhis face.",
    "\u201cWell my friend\u201d cried Poirot before I could get in a word \u201cwhat do\nyou think Mon Dieu I had some warm moments in that court I did not\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pigheaded as to refuse to\nsay anything at all.",
    "Decidedly it was the policy of an imbecile.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m There are other explanations besides that of imbecility\u201d I\nremarked.",
    "\u201cFor if the case against him is true how could he defend\nhimself except by silence\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy in a thousand ingenious ways\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cSee say that it is\nI who have committed this murder I can think of seven most plausible\nstories Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s stony denials\u201d\n\nI could not help laughing.",
    "\u201cMy dear Poirot I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy But\nseriously in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives you\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp\u2019s\ninnocence\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not now as much as before Nothing has changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the evidence is so conclusive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes too conclusive.\u201d\n\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage and proceeded up the now\nfamiliar stairs.",
    "\u201cYes yes too conclusive\u201d continued Poirot almost to himself.",
    "\u201cReal\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory.",
    "It has to be\nexamined\u2014sifted.",
    "But here the whole thing is cut and dried.",
    "No my\nfriend this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured\u2014so cleverly\nthat it has defeated its own ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you make that out\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible\nit was very hard to disprove.",
    "But in his anxiety the criminal has\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\u201d\n\nI was silent.",
    "And in a minute or two Poirot continued\n\n\u201cLet us look at the matter like this.",
    "Here is a man let us say who\nsets out to poison his wife.",
    "He has lived by his wits as the saying\ngoes.",
    "Presumably therefore he has some wits.",
    "He is not altogether a\nfool.",
    "Well how does he set about it He goes boldly to the village\nchemist\u2019s and purchases strychnine under his own name with a trumped\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd.",
    "He does not\nemploy the poison that night.",
    "No he waits until he has had a violent\nquarrel with her of which the whole household is cognisant and which\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him.",
    "He prepares no defence\u2014no\nshadow of an alibi yet he knows the chemist\u2019s assistant must\nnecessarily come forward with the facts.",
    "Bah Do not ask me to believe\nthat any man could be so idiotic Only a lunatic who wished to commit\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged would act so\u201d\n\n\u201cStill\u2014I do not see\u2014\u2014\u201d I began.",
    "\u201cNeither do I see.",
    "I tell you mon ami it puzzles me.",
    "Me\u2014Hercule\nPoirot\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if you believe him innocent how do you explain his buying the\nstrychnine\u201d\n\n\u201cVery simply.",
    "He did not buy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Mace recognized him\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\nInglethorp\u2019s and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp and dressed in\nMr. Inglethorp\u2019s rather noticeable clothes.",
    "He could not recognize a\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance since you\nremember he himself had only been in the village a fortnight and Mrs.\nInglethorp dealt principally with Coot\u2019s in Tadminster.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you think\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMon ami do you remember the two points I laid stress upon Leave\nthe first one for the moment what was the second\u201d\n\n\u201cThe important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes has\na black beard and uses glasses\u201d I quoted.",
    "\u201cExactly.",
    "Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\nLawrence Cavendish.",
    "Would it be easy\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d I said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cOf course an actor\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.",
    "\u201cAnd why would it not be easy I will tell you my friend Because they\nare both cleanshaven men.",
    "To make up successfully as one of these two\nin broad daylight it would need an actor of genius and a certain\ninitial facial resemblance.",
    "But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp all\nthat is changed.",
    "His clothes his beard the glasses which hide his\neyes\u2014those are the salient points about his personal appearance.",
    "Now\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal To divert suspicion from\nhimself is it not so And how can he best do that By throwing it on\nsomeone else.",
    "In this instance there was a man ready to his hand.",
    "Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s guilt.",
    "It was\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected but to make it a\nsure thing there must be tangible proof\u2014such as the actual buying of\nthe poison and that with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\nInglethorp was not difficult.",
    "Remember this young Mace had never\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp.",
    "How should he doubt that the man in\nhis clothes with his beard and his glasses was not Alfred\nInglethorp\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be so\u201d I said fascinated by Poirot\u2019s eloquence.",
    "\u201cBut if that\nwas the case why does he not say where he was at six o\u2019clock on Monday\nevening\u201d\n\n\u201cAh why indeed\u201d said Poirot calming down.",
    "\u201cIf he were arrested he\nprobably would speak but I do not want it to come to that.",
    "I must make\nhim see the gravity of his position.",
    "There is of course something\ndiscreditable behind his silence.",
    "If he did not murder his wife he is\nnevertheless a scoundrel and has something of his own to conceal\nquite apart from the murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can it be\u201d I mused won over to Poirot\u2019s views for the moment\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\nwas the correct one.",
    "\u201cCan you not guess\u201d asked Poirot smiling.",
    "\u201cNo can you\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes I had a little idea sometime ago\u2014and it has turned out to be\ncorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never told me\u201d I said reproachfully.",
    "Poirot spread out his hands apologetically.",
    "\u201cPardon me mon ami you were not precisely sympathique.\u201d He turned\nto me earnestly.",
    "\u201cTell me\u2014you see now that he must not be arrested\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps\u201d I said doubtfully for I was really quite indifferent to the\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp and thought that a good fright would do him\nno harm.",
    "Poirot who was watching me intently gave a sigh.",
    "\u201cCome my friend\u201d he said changing the subject \u201capart from Mr.\nInglethorp how did the evidence at the inquest strike you\u201d\n\n\u201cOh pretty much what I expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid nothing strike you as peculiar about it\u201d\n\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish and I hedged\n\n\u201cIn what way\u201d\n\n\u201cWell Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\u2019s evidence for instance\u201d\n\nI was relieved.",
    "\u201cOh Lawrence No I don\u2019t think so.",
    "He\u2019s always a nervous chap.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\nby means of the tonic she was taking that did not strike you as\nstrange\u2014 hein\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I can\u2019t say it did.",
    "The doctors ridiculed it of course.",
    "But it was\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman.",
    "You told me yourself that he\nhad started by studying medicine and that he had taken his degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes that\u2019s true.",
    "I never thought of that.\u201d I was rather startled.",
    "\u201cIt\nis odd.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cFrom the first his behaviour has been peculiar.",
    "Of all the household\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\npoisoning and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes.",
    "If it had been\nMonsieur John I could have understood it.",
    "He has no technical\nknowledge and is by nature unimaginative.",
    "But Monsieur Lawrence\u2014no\nAnd now today he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\nknown was ridiculous.",
    "There is food for thought in this mon ami\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very confusing\u201d I agreed.",
    "\u201cThen there is Mrs. Cavendish\u201d continued Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s another who\nis not telling all she knows What do you make of her attitude\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it.",
    "It seems inconceivable that she\nshould be shielding Alfred Inglethorp.",
    "Yet that is what it looks like.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded reflectively.",
    "\u201cYes it is queer.",
    "One thing is certain she overheard a good deal more\nof that \u2018private conversation\u2019 than she was willing to admit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\neavesdrop\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.",
    "One thing her evidence has shown me.",
    "I made a mistake.",
    "Dorcas was quite right.",
    "The quarrel did take place earlier in the\nafternoon about four o\u2019clock as she said.\u201d\n\nI looked at him curiously.",
    "I had never understood his insistence on\nthat point.",
    "\u201cYes a good deal that was peculiar came out today\u201d continued Poirot.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Bauerstein now what was he doing up and dressed at that hour\nin the morning It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\nfact.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has insomnia I believe\u201d I said doubtfully.",
    "\u201cWhich is a very good or a very bad explanation\u201d remarked Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt\ncovers everything and explains nothing.",
    "I shall keep my eye on our\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny more faults to find with the evidence\u201d I inquired satirically.",
    "\u201cMon ami\u201d replied Poirot gravely \u201cwhen you find that people are not\ntelling you the truth\u2014look out Now unless I am much mistaken at the\ninquest today only one\u2014at most two persons were speaking the truth\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come now Poirot I won\u2019t cite Lawrence or Mrs. Cavendish.",
    "But\nthere\u2019s John\u2014and Miss Howard surely they were speaking the truth\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of them my friend One I grant you but both\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock.",
    "Miss Howard\u2019s evidence\nunimportant as it was had been given in such a downright\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\nsincerity.",
    "Still I had a great respect for Poirot\u2019s sagacity\u2014except on\nthe occasions when he was what I described to myself as \u201cfoolishly\npigheaded.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really think so\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cMiss Howard had always seemed to me\nso essentially honest\u2014almost uncomfortably so.\u201d\n\nPoirot gave me a curious look which I could not quite fathom.",
    "He\nseemed to speak and then checked himself.",
    "\u201cMiss Murdoch too\u201d I continued \u201cthere\u2019s nothing untruthful about\nher.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "But it was strange that she never heard a sound sleeping next\ndoor whereas Mrs. Cavendish in the other wing of the building\ndistinctly heard the table fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell she\u2019s young.",
    "And she sleeps soundly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes indeed She must be a famous sleeper that one\u201d\n\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice but at that moment a smart\nknock reached our ears and looking out of the window we perceived the\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.",
    "Poirot seized his hat gave a ferocious twist to his moustache and\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve motioned\nme to precede him down the stairs there we joined the detectives and\nset out for Styles.",
    "I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\nshock\u2014especially to John though of course after the verdict he had\nrealized that it was only a matter of time.",
    "Still the presence of the\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\nhave done.",
    "Poirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up and it was\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household with the\nexception of the servants should be assembled together in the\ndrawingroom.",
    "I realized the significance of this.",
    "It was up to Poirot\nto make his boast good.",
    "Personally I was not sanguine.",
    "Poirot might have excellent reasons for\nhis belief in Inglethorp\u2019s innocence but a man of the type of\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs and these I doubted if Poirot\ncould supply.",
    "Before very long we had all trooped into the drawingroom the door of\nwhich Japp closed.",
    "Poirot politely set chairs for everyone.",
    "The\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes.",
    "I think that for the\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream but a\ntangible reality.",
    "We had read of such things\u2014now we ourselves were\nactors in the drama.",
    "Tomorrow the daily papers all over England\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines\n\n\u201cMYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX\u201d\n\n    \u201cWEALTHY LADY POISONED\u201d\n\n\nThere would be pictures of Styles snapshots of \u201cThe family leaving\nthe Inquest\u201d\u2014the village photographer had not been idle All the things\nthat one had read a hundred times\u2014things that happen to other people\nnot to oneself.",
    "And now in this house a murder had been committed.",
    "In\nfront of us were \u201cthe detectives in charge of the case.\u201d The wellknown\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\nPoirot opened the proceedings.",
    "I think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.",
    "\u201cMesdames and messieurs\u201d said Poirot bowing as though he were a\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture \u201cI have asked you to come here\nall together for a certain object.",
    "That object it concerns Mr. Alfred\nInglethorp.\u201d\n\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himself\u2014I think unconsciously\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him\u2014and he gave a faint\nstart as Poirot pronounced his name.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Inglethorp\u201d said Poirot addressing him directly \u201ca very dark\nshadow is resting on this house\u2014the shadow of murder.\u201d\n\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.",
    "\u201cMy poor wife\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cPoor Emily It is terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think monsieur\u201d said Poirot pointedly \u201cthat you quite\nrealize how terrible it may be\u2014for you.\u201d And as Inglethorp did not\nappear to understand he added \u201cMr.",
    "Inglethorp you are standing in\nvery grave danger.\u201d\n\nThe two detectives fidgeted.",
    "I saw the official caution \u201cAnything you\nsay will be used in evidence against you\u201d actually hovering on\nSummerhaye\u2019s lips.",
    "Poirot went on.",
    "\u201cDo you understand now monsieur\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "What do you mean\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean\u201d said Poirot deliberately \u201cthat you are suspected of\npoisoning your wife.\u201d\n\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.",
    "\u201cGood heavens\u201d cried Inglethorp starting up.",
    "\u201cWhat a monstrous idea\nI\u2014poison my dearest Emily\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think\u201d\u2014Poirot watched him narrowly\u2014\u201cthat you quite realize\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest.",
    "Mr.\nInglethorp knowing what I have now told you do you still refuse to\nsay where you were at six o\u2019clock on Monday afternoon\u201d\n\nWith a groan Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\nhis hands.",
    "Poirot approached and stood over him.",
    "\u201cSpeak\u201d he cried menacingly.",
    "With an effort Inglethorp raised his face from his hands.",
    "Then slowly\nand deliberately he shook his head.",
    "\u201cYou will not speak\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\nof what you say.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully like a man whose mind is made up.",
    "\u201cSoit\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThen I must speak for you.\u201d\n\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.",
    "\u201cYou How can you speak You do not know\u2014\u2014\u201d he broke off abruptly.",
    "Poirot turned to face us.",
    "\u201cMesdames and messieurs I speak Listen\nI Hercule Poirot affirm that the man who entered the chemist\u2019s shop\nand purchased strychnine at six o\u2019clock on Monday last was not Mr.\nInglethorp for at six o\u2019clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm.",
    "I can produce no\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together either\nat six or just after and as you may know the Abbey Farm Mrs.\nRaikes\u2019s home is at least two and a half miles distant from the\nvillage.",

    "You must\nsee them of course.",

    "\u201cI\u2019m much obliged to you.",
    "A\npretty mare\u2019s nest arresting him would have been.\u201d He turned to\nInglethorp.",

    "\u201cThere was a certain\nrumour\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA most malicious and utterly untrue one\u201d interrupted Alfred\nInglethorp in an agitated voice.",
    "\u201cAnd Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\npresent.",

    "\u201cWith my poor Emily not yet buried\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\nstarted.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween you and me sir\u201d remarked Japp \u201cI\u2019d sooner have any amount\nof rumours than be arrested for murder.",
    "And I venture to think your\npoor lady would have felt the same.",
    "And if it hadn\u2019t been for Mr.\nPoirot here arrested you would have been as sure as eggs is eggs\u201d\n\n\u201cI was foolish no doubt\u201d murmured Inglethorp.",
    "\u201cBut you do not know\ninspector how I have been persecuted and maligned.\u201d And he shot a\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.",
    "\u201cNow sir\u201d said Japp turning briskly to John \u201cI should like to see\nthe lady\u2019s bedroom please and after that I\u2019ll have a little chat with\nthe servants.",
    "Don\u2019t you bother about anything.",
    "Mr. Poirot here will\nshow me the way.\u201d\n\nAs they all went out of the room Poirot turned and made me a sign to\nfollow him upstairs.",

    "\u201cQuick go to the other wing.",
    "Stand there\u2014just this side of the baize\ndoor.",

    "With the exception of\nCynthia Murdoch\u2019s everyone\u2019s room was in this left wing.",

    "I made but a slight gesture\u201d\u2014I know Poirot\u2019s gestures\u2014\u201cwith the\nleft hand and over went the table by the bed\u201d\n\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crestfallen that I hastened to\nconsole him.",
    "\u201cNever mind old chap.",
    "What does it matter Your triumph downstairs\nexcited you.",
    "I can tell you that was a surprise to us all.",

    "What are you\ngoing to do now Where are the Scotland Yard fellows\u201d\n\n\u201cGone down to interview the servants.",
    "I showed them all our exhibits.",
    "I\nam disappointed in Japp.",
    "He has no method\u201d\n\n\u201cHullo\u201d I said looking out of the window.",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s Dr. Bauerstein.",
    "I\nbelieve you\u2019re right about that man Poirot.",
    "I don\u2019t like him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is clever\u201d observed Poirot meditatively.",
    "\u201cOh clever as the devil I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\nplight he was in on Tuesday.",
    "You never saw such a spectacle\u201d And I\ndescribed the doctor\u2019s adventure.",
    "\u201cHe looked a regular scarecrow\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw him then\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Of course he didn\u2019t want to come in\u2014it was just after dinner\u2014but\nMr. Inglethorp insisted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders.",
    "\u201cWas Dr.\nBauerstein here on Tuesday evening Here And you never told me Why\ndid you not tell me Why Why\u201d\n\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.",
    "\u201cMy dear Poirot\u201d I expostulated \u201cI never thought it would interest\nyou.",
    "I didn\u2019t know it was of any importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportance It is of the first importance So Dr. Bauerstein was here\non Tuesday night\u2014the night of the murder.",
    "Hastings do you not see\nThat alters everything\u2014everything\u201d\n\nI had never seen him so upset.",
    "Loosening his hold of me he\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks still murmuring to\nhimself \u201cYes that alters everything\u2014everything.\u201d\n\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.",
    "\u201cAllons\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWe must act at once.",
    "Where is Mr. Cavendish\u201d\n\nJohn was in the smokingroom.",
    "Poirot went straight to him.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Cavendish I have some important business in Tadminster.",
    "A new\nclue.",
    "May I take your motor\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy of course.",
    "Do you mean at once\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you please.\u201d\n\nJohn rang the bell and ordered round the car.",
    "In another ten minutes\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.",
    "\u201cNow Poirot\u201d I remarked resignedly \u201cperhaps you will tell me what\nall this is about\u201d\n\n\u201cWell mon ami a good deal you can guess for yourself.",
    "Of course you\nrealize that now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it the whole position is\ngreatly changed.",
    "We are face to face with an entirely new problem.",
    "We\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison.",
    "We have\ncleared away the manufactured clues.",
    "Now for the real ones.",
    "I have\nascertained that anyone in the household with the exception of Mrs.\nCavendish who was playing tennis with you could have personated Mr.\nInglethorp on Monday evening.",
    "In the same way we have his statement\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall.",
    "No one took much notice of\nthat at the inquest\u2014but now it has a very different significance.",
    "We\nmust find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there.",
    "From your\naccount there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\ngo near the coffee\u2014Mrs.",
    "Cavendish and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes that is so.\u201d I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.",
    "Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.",
    "\u201cIn clearing Alfred Inglethorp\u201d continued Poirot \u201cI have been obliged\nto show my hand sooner than I intended.",
    "As long as I might be thought\nto be pursuing him the criminal would be off his guard.",
    "Now he will\nbe doubly careful.",
    "Yes\u2014doubly careful.\u201d He turned to me abruptly.",
    "\u201cTell\nme Hastings you yourself\u2014have you no suspicions of anybody\u201d\n\nI hesitated.",
    "To tell the truth an idea wild and extravagant in\nitself had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain.",
    "I had\nrejected it as absurd nevertheless it persisted.",
    "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t call it a suspicion\u201d I murmured.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s so utterly\nfoolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome now\u201d urged Poirot encouragingly.",
    "\u201cDo not fear.",
    "Speak your mind.",
    "You should always pay attention to your instincts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then\u201d I blurted out \u201cit\u2019s absurd\u2014but I suspect Miss Howard of\nnot telling all she knows\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Howard\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014you\u2019ll laugh at me\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all.",
    "Why should I\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help feeling\u201d I continued blunderingly \u201cthat we\u2019ve rather\nleft her out of the possible suspects simply on the strength of her\nhaving been away from the place.",
    "But after all she was only fifteen\nmiles away.",
    "A car would do it in half an hour.",
    "Can we say positively\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder\u201d\n\n\u201cYes my friend\u201d said Poirot unexpectedly \u201cwe can.",
    "One of my first\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday\nand that\u2014a convoy coming in unexpectedly\u2014she had kindly offered to\nremain on night duty which offer was gratefully accepted.",
    "That\ndisposes of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d I said rather nonplussed.",
    "\u201cReally\u201d I continued \u201cit\u2019s her\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\nsuspecting her.",
    "I can\u2019t help feeling she\u2019d do anything against him.",
    "And\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\nwill.",
    "She might have burnt the new one mistaking it for the earlier\none in his favour.",
    "She is so terribly bitter against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou consider her vehemence unnatural\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2014es.",
    "She is so very violent.",
    "I wondered really whether she is quite\nsane on that point.\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head energetically.",
    "\u201cNo no you are on a wrong tack there.",
    "There is nothing weakminded or\ndegenerate about Miss Howard.",
    "She is an excellent specimen of\nwellbalanced English beef and brawn.",
    "She is sanity itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania.",
    "My idea was\u2014a very\nridiculous one no doubt\u2014that she had intended to poison him\u2014and that\nin some way Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake.",
    "But I don\u2019t at\nall see how it could have been done.",
    "The whole thing is absurd and\nridiculous to the last degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill you are right in one thing.",
    "It is always wise to suspect\neverybody until you can prove logically and to your own satisfaction\nthat they are innocent.",
    "Now what reasons are there against Miss\nHoward\u2019s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy she was devoted to her\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cTcha Tcha\u201d cried Poirot irritably.",
    "\u201cYou argue like a child.",
    "If Miss\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady she would be quite\nequally capable of simulating devotion.",
    "No we must look elsewhere.",
    "You\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural but you are quite wrong\nin the deduction you draw from it.",
    "I have drawn my own deductions\nwhich I believe to be correct but I will not speak of them at\npresent.\u201d He paused a minute then went on.",
    "\u201cNow to my way of\nthinking there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard\u2019s being the\nmurderess.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is\u201d\n\n\u201cThat in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s death benefit Miss\nHoward.",
    "Now there is no murder without a motive.\u201d\n\nI reflected.",
    "\u201cCould not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cBut you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cThat was for a reason.",
    "I did not want to mention the name of the\nperson who was actually in my mind.",
    "Miss Howard occupied very much the\nsame position so I used her name instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so.",
    "Why that will made on the\nafternoon of her death may\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Poirot\u2019s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.",
    "\u201cNo my friend.",
    "I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.",
    "But I can tell you this much\u2014it was not in Miss Howard\u2019s favour.\u201d\n\nI accepted his assurance though I did not really see how he could be\nso positive about the matter.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d I said with a sigh \u201cwe will acquit Miss Howard then.",
    "It is\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her.",
    "It was what you said\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\u201d\n\nPoirot looked puzzled.",
    "\u201cWhat did I say about her evidence at the inquest\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\nsuspicion\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2014ah\u2014yes.\u201d He seemed a little confused but recovered himself.",
    "\u201cBy\nthe way Hastings there is something I want you to do for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "What is it\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish I want you\nto say this to him.",
    "\u2018I have a message for you from Poirot.",
    "He says\n\u201cFind the extra coffeecup and you can rest in peace\u201d\u2019 Nothing more.",
    "Nothing less.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Find the extra coffeecup and you can rest in peace.\u2019 Is that\nright\u201d I asked much mystified.",
    "\u201cExcellent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does it mean\u201d\n\n\u201cAh that I will leave you to find out.",
    "You have access to the facts.",
    "Just say that to him and see what he says.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well\u2014but it\u2019s all extremely mysterious.\u201d\n\nWe were running into Tadminster now and Poirot directed the car to the\n\u201cAnalytical Chemist.\u201d\n\nPoirot hopped down briskly and went inside.",
    "In a few minutes he was\nback again.",
    "\u201cThere\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThat is all my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing there\u201d I asked in lively curiosity.",
    "\u201cI left something to be analysed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but what\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that has already been tested\u201d I cried stupefied.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Bauerstein\nhad it tested and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\nbeing strychnine in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested\u201d replied Poirot quietly.",
    "\u201cWell then\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I have a fancy for having it analysed again that is all.\u201d\n\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.",
    "This proceeding of Poirot\u2019s in respect of the cocoa puzzled me\nintensely.",
    "I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it.",
    "However my\nconfidence in him which at one time had rather waned was fully\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp\u2019s innocence had been so\ntriumphantly vindicated.",
    "The funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day and on\nMonday as I came down to a late breakfast John drew me aside and\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning to take up\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\nplans.",
    "\u201cAnd really it\u2019s a great relief to think he\u2019s going Hastings\u201d\ncontinued my honest friend.",
    "\u201cIt was bad enough before when we thought\nhe\u2019d done it but I\u2019m hanged if it isn\u2019t worse now when we all feel\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow.",
    "The fact is we\u2019ve\ntreated him abominably.",
    "Of course things did look black against him.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\ndid.",
    "Still there it is we were in the wrong and now there\u2019s a\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends which is difficult when\none doesn\u2019t like the fellow a bit better than one did before.",
    "The whole\nthing\u2019s damned awkward And I\u2019m thankful he\u2019s had the tact to take\nhimself off.",
    "It\u2019s a good thing Styles wasn\u2019t the mater\u2019s to leave to\nhim.",
    "Couldn\u2019t bear to think of the fellow lording it here.",
    "He\u2019s welcome\nto her money.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to keep up the place all right\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cOh yes.",
    "There are the death duties of course but half my father\u2019s\nmoney goes with the place and Lawrence will stay with us for the\npresent so there is his share as well.",
    "We shall be pinched at first\nof course because as I once told you I am in a bit of a hole\nfinancially myself.",
    "Still the Johnnies will wait now.\u201d\n\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp\u2019s approaching departure we had the\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy.",
    "Cynthia\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant was looking quite her\npretty self again and we all with the exception of Lawrence who\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous were quietly cheerful at the\nopening of a new and hopeful future.",
    "The papers of course had been full of the tragedy.",
    "Glaring headlines\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household subtle\ninnuendoes the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.",
    "Nothing was spared us.",
    "It was a slack time.",
    "The war was momentarily\ninactive and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\nfashionable life \u201cThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\u201d was the topic of\nthe moment.",
    "Naturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes.",
    "The house was\nconstantly besieged by reporters who were consistently denied\nadmission but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras for any unwary members of the\nhousehold.",
    "We all lived in a blast of publicity.",
    "The Scotland Yard men\ncame and went examining questioning lynxeyed and reserved of\ntongue.",
    "Towards what end they were working we did not know.",
    "Had they\nany clue or would the whole thing remain in the category of\nundiscovered crimes\n\nAfter breakfast Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously and asked if\nshe might have a few words with me.",
    "\u201cCertainly.",
    "What is it Dorcas\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s just this sir.",
    "You\u2019ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\ntoday perhaps\u201d I nodded.",
    "\u201cWell sir you know how he asked me so\nparticular if the mistress or anyone else had a green dress\u201d\n\n\u201cYes yes.",
    "You have found one\u201d My interest was aroused.",
    "\u201cNo not that sir.",
    "But since then I\u2019ve remembered what the young\ngentlemen\u201d\u2014John and Lawrence were still the \u201cyoung gentlemen\u201d to\nDorcas\u2014\u201ccall the \u2018dressingup box.\u2019 It\u2019s up in the front attic sir.",
    "A\ngreat chest full of old clothes and fancy dresses and what not.",
    "And\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\nthem.",
    "So if you\u2019d tell the Belgian gentleman\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell him Dorcas\u201d I promised.",
    "\u201cThank you very much sir.",
    "A very nice gentleman he is sir.",
    "And quite\na different class from them two detectives from London what goes\nprying about and asking questions.",
    "I don\u2019t hold with foreigners as a\nrule but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\nBelges isn\u2019t the ordinary run of foreigners and certainly he\u2019s a most\npolite spoken gentleman.\u201d\n\nDear old Dorcas As she stood there with her honest face upturned to\nmine I thought what a fine specimen she was of the oldfashioned\nservant that is so fast dying out.",
    "I thought I might as well go down to the village at once and look up\nPoirot but I met him halfway coming up to the house and at once\ngave him Dorcas\u2019s message.",
    "\u201cAh the brave Dorcas We will look at the chest although\u2014but no\nmatter\u2014we will examine it all the same.\u201d\n\nWe entered the house by one of the windows.",
    "There was no one in the\nhall and we went straight up to the attic.",
    "Sure enough there was the chest a fine old piece all studded with\nbrass nails and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\ngarment.",
    "Poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony.",
    "There\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades but Poirot shook his\nhead over them all.",
    "He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search as\nthough he expected no great results from it.",
    "Suddenly he gave an\nexclamation.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d\n\n\u201cLook\u201d\n\nThe chest was nearly empty and there reposing right at the bottom\nwas a magnificent black beard.",
    "\u201cOh\u00f3\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cOh\u00f3\u201d He turned it over in his hands\nexamining it closely.",
    "\u201cNew\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cYes quite new.\u201d\n\nAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation he replaced it in the chest heaped all\nthe other things on top of it as before and made his way briskly\ndownstairs.",
    "He went straight to the pantry where we found Dorcas\nbusily polishing her silver.",
    "Poirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness and went on\n\n\u201cWe have been looking through that chest Dorcas.",
    "I am much obliged to\nyou for mentioning it.",
    "There is indeed a fine collection there.",
    "Are\nthey often used may I ask\u201d\n\n\u201cWell sir not very often nowadays though from time to time we do\nhave what the young gentlemen call \u2018a dressup night.\u2019 And very funny\nit is sometimes sir.",
    "Mr. Lawrence he\u2019s wonderful.",
    "Most comic I shall\nnever forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia I think he\ncalled it\u2014a sort of Eastern King it was.",
    "He had the big paper knife in\nhis hand and \u2018Mind Dorcas\u2019 he says \u2018you\u2019ll have to be very\nrespectful.",
    "This is my specially sharpened scimitar and it\u2019s off with\nyour head if I\u2019m at all displeased with you\u2019 Miss Cynthia she was\nwhat they call an Apache or some such name\u2014a Frenchified sort of\ncutthroat I take it to be.",
    "A real sight she looked.",
    "You\u2019d never have\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\nsuch a ruffian.",
    "Nobody would have known her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese evenings must have been great fun\u201d said Poirot genially.",
    "\u201cI\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs\nwhen he was Shah of Persia\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did have a beard sir\u201d replied Dorcas smiling.",
    "\u201cAnd well I know\nit for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with And\nI\u2019m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance.",
    "I didn\u2019t know as\nthere was a beard up there at all.",
    "It must have been got quite lately\nI think.",
    "There was a red wig I know but nothing else in the way of\nhair.",
    "Burnt corks they use mostly\u2014though \u2018tis messy getting it off\nagain.",
    "Miss Cynthia was a nigger once and oh the trouble she had.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard\u201d said Poirot\nthoughtfully as we walked out into the hall again.",
    "\u201cDo you think it is the one\u201d I whispered eagerly.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cI do.",
    "You notice it had been trimmed\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s and I found one\nor two snipped hairs.",
    "Hastings this affair is very deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho put it in the chest I wonder\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone with a good deal of intelligence\u201d remarked Poirot dryly.",
    "\u201cYou\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\npresence would not be remarked Yes he is intelligent.",
    "But we must be\nmore intelligent.",
    "We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\nof being intelligent at all.\u201d\n\nI acquiesced.",
    "\u201cThere mon ami you will be of great assistance to me.\u201d\n\nI was pleased with the compliment.",
    "There had been times when I hardly\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he continued staring at me thoughtfully \u201cyou will be\ninvaluable.\u201d\n\nThis was naturally gratifying but Poirot\u2019s next words were not so\nwelcome.",
    "\u201cI must have an ally in the house\u201d he observed reflectively.",
    "\u201cYou have me\u201d I protested.",
    "\u201cTrue but you are not sufficient.\u201d\n\nI was hurt and showed it.",
    "Poirot hurried to explain himself.",
    "\u201cYou do not quite take my meaning.",
    "You are known to be working with me.",
    "I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I see.",
    "How about John\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I think not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dear fellow isn\u2019t perhaps very bright\u201d I said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cHere comes Miss Howard\u201d said Poirot suddenly.",
    "\u201cShe is the very\nperson.",
    "But I am in her black books since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.",
    "Still we can but try.\u201d\n\nWith a nod that was barely civil Miss Howard assented to Poirot\u2019s\nrequest for a few minutes\u2019 conversation.",

    "What of that I dare\nsay he soaked fly paper as I told you at the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is arsenic\u2014not strychnine\u201d said Poirot mildly.",

    "Otherwise Poirot himself might relieve me of it.",
    "It was true that I\ndid not quite gather its purport but I flattered myself that by\nLawrence\u2019s reply and perhaps a little skillful crossexamination on my\npart I should soon perceive its significance.",

    "\u201cSomebody might accept you next time.",

    "Thinking over the interview it struck me as being profoundly\nunsatisfactory.",
    "It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village and\nlook up Bauerstein.",
    "Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.",
    "At the same time it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\nhave as to his being suspected.",
    "I remembered how Poirot had relied on\nmy diplomacy.",
    "Accordingly I went to the little house with the\n\u201cApartments\u201d card inserted in the window where I knew he lodged and\ntapped on the door.",

    "CHAPTER X.",
    "THE ARREST\n\n\nTo my extreme annoyance Poirot was not in and the old Belgian who\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.",
    "I was dumbfounded.",
    "What on earth could Poirot be doing in London Was\nit a sudden decision on his part or had he already made up his mind\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier\n\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance.",
    "With Poirot away I\nwas uncertain how to act.",
    "Had he foreseen this arrest Had he not in\nall probability been the cause of it Those questions I could not\nresolve.",
    "But in the meantime what was I to do Should I announce the\narrest openly at Styles or not Though I did not acknowledge it to\nmyself the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me.",
    "Would it not\nbe a terrible shock to her For the moment I set aside utterly any\nsuspicions of her.",
    "She could not be implicated\u2014otherwise I should have\nheard some hint of it.",
    "Of course there was no possibility of being able permanently to\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein\u2019s arrest from her.",
    "It would be announced in\nevery newspaper on the morrow.",
    "Still I shrank from blurting it out.",
    "If\nonly Poirot had been accessible I could have asked his advice.",
    "What\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way\n\nIn spite of myself my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\nheightened.",
    "I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor had not\nPoirot put it into my head.",
    "Yes decidedly the little man was clever.",
    "After some reflecting I decided to take John into my confidence and\nleave him to make the matter public or not as he thought fit.",
    "He gave vent to a prodigious whistle as I imparted the news.",
    "\u201cGreat Scott You were right then.",
    "I couldn\u2019t believe it at the\ntime.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it is astonishing until you get used to the idea and see how it\nmakes everything fit in.",
    "Now what are we to do Of course it will be\ngenerally known tomorrow.\u201d\n\nJohn reflected.",
    "\u201cNever mind\u201d he said at last \u201cwe won\u2019t say anything at present.",
    "There\nis no need.",
    "As you say it will be known soon enough.\u201d\n\nBut to my intense surprise on getting down early the next morning and\neagerly opening the newspapers there was not a word about the arrest\nThere was a column of mere padding about \u201cThe Styles Poisoning Case\u201d\nbut nothing further.",
    "It was rather inexplicable but I supposed that\nfor some reason or other Japp wished to keep it out of the papers.",
    "It\nworried me just a little for it suggested the possibility that there\nmight be further arrests to come.",
    "After breakfast I decided to go down to the village and see if Poirot\nhad returned yet but before I could start a wellknown face blocked\none of the windows and the wellknown voice said\n\n\u201cBonjour mon ami\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I exclaimed with relief and seizing him by both hands I\ndragged him into the room.",
    "\u201cI was never so glad to see anyone.",
    "Listen\nI have said nothing to anybody but John.",
    "Is that right\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friend\u201d replied Poirot \u201cI do not know what you are talking\nabout.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr.",
    "Bauerstein\u2019s arrest of course\u201d I answered impatiently.",
    "\u201cIs Bauerstein arrested then\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you not know it\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the least in the world.\u201d But pausing a moment he added \u201cStill\nit does not surprise me.",
    "After all we are only four miles from the\ncoast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe coast\u201d I asked puzzled.",
    "\u201cWhat has that got to do with it\u201d\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cSurely it is obvious\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to me.",
    "No doubt I am very dense but I cannot see what the\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\nInglethorp.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing at all of course\u201d replied Poirot smiling.",
    "\u201cBut we were\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d cried Poirot in apparently lively astonishment.",

    "\u201cBut\u2014but I thought you thought so too\u201d\n\nPoirot gave me one look which conveyed a wondering pity and his full\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.",
    "\u201cDo you mean to say\u201d I asked slowly adapting myself to the new idea\n\u201cthat Dr. Bauerstein is a spy\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cHave you never suspected it\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never entered my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\nbury himself in a little village like this and should be in the habit\nof walking about at all hours of the night fully dressed\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d I confessed \u201cI never thought of such a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is of course a German by birth\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully\n\u201cthough he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\nhim as anything but an Englishman.",

    "\u201cYes.",
    "I should fancy he had found her very useful\u201d remarked Poirot.",
    "\u201cSo long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together any\nother vagaries of the doctor\u2019s passed unobserved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you think he never really cared for her\u201d I asked eagerly\u2014rather\ntoo eagerly perhaps under the circumstances.",

    "She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\nthe room and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper.",
    "This she\nhanded to Poirot murmuring as she did so the cryptic words\n\n\u201cOn top of the wardrobe.\u201d Then she hurriedly left the room.",
    "Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly and uttered an exclamation\nof satisfaction.",
    "He spread it out on the table.",
    "\u201cCome here Hastings.",
    "Now tell me what is that initial\u2014J.",
    "or L.\u201d\n\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper rather dusty as though it had\nlain by for some time.",
    "But it was the label that was attracting\nPoirot\u2019s attention.",
    "At the top it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\nParkson\u2019s the wellknown theatrical costumiers and it was addressed\nto \u201c\u2014the debatable initial Cavendish Esq.",
    "Styles Court Styles St.\nMary Essex.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be T. or it might be L.\u201d I said after studying the thing\nfor a minute or two.",
    "\u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t a J.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u201d replied Poirot folding up the paper again.",
    "\u201cI also am of\nyour way of thinking.",
    "It is an L. depend upon it\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did it come from\u201d I asked curiously.",
    "\u201cIs it important\u201d\n\n\u201cModerately so.",
    "It confirms a surmise of mine.",
    "Having deduced its\nexistence I set Miss Howard to search for it and as you see she has\nbeen successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she mean by \u2018On the top of the wardrobe\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShe meant\u201d replied Poirot promptly \u201cthat she found it on top of a\nwardrobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cA funny place for a piece of brown paper\u201d I mused.",
    "\u201cNot at all.",
    "The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\npaper and cardboard boxes.",
    "I have kept them there myself.",
    "Neatly\narranged there is nothing to offend the eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I asked earnestly \u201chave you made up your mind about this\ncrime\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014that is to say I believe I know how it was committed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately I have no proof beyond my surmise unless\u2014\u2014\u201d With\nsudden energy he caught me by the arm and whirled me down the hall\ncalling out in French in his excitement \u201cMademoiselle Dorcas\nMademoiselle Dorcas un moment s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet\u201d\n\nDorcas quite flurried by the noise came hurrying out of the pantry.",
    "\u201cMy good Dorcas I have an idea\u2014a little idea\u2014if it should prove\njustified what magnificent chance Tell me on Monday not Tuesday\nDorcas but Monday the day before the tragedy did anything go wrong\nwith Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s bell\u201d\n\nDorcas looked very surprised.",
    "\u201cYes sir now you mention it it did though I don\u2019t know how you came\nto hear of it.",
    "A mouse or some such must have nibbled the wire\nthrough.",
    "The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.\u201d\n\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy Poirot led the way back to\nthe morningroom.",
    "\u201cSee you one should not ask for outside proof\u2014no reason should be\nenough.",
    "But the flesh is weak it is consolation to find that one is on\nthe right track.",

    "I run I\nleap\u201d\n\nAnd in very truth run and leap he did gambolling wildly down the\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.",

    "He asked Dorcas some question about a bell\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\nyou see\u201d\n\nMary laughed.",
    "\u201cHow ridiculous He\u2019s going out of the gate.",
    "Isn\u2019t he coming back\ntoday\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "I\u2019ve given up trying to guess what he\u2019ll do next.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he quite mad Mr. Hastings\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.",
    "Sometimes I feel sure he is as mad as a\nhatter and then just as he is at his maddest I find there is method\nin his madness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\nIn spite of her laugh Mary was looking thoughtful this morning.",
    "She\nseemed grave almost sad.",
    "It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\nthe subject of Cynthia.",
    "I began rather tactfully I thought but I\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.",
    "\u201cYou are an excellent advocate I have no doubt Mr. Hastings but in\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away.",
    "Cynthia will run no risk\nof encountering any unkindness from me.\u201d\n\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn\u2019t thought\u2014\u2014 But again\nshe stopped me and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\nCynthia and her troubles out of my mind.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Hastings\u201d she said \u201cdo you think I and my husband are happy\ntogether\u201d\n\nI was considerably taken aback and murmured something about it\u2019s not\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d she said quietly \u201cwhether it is your business or not I will\ntell you that we are not happy.\u201d\n\nI said nothing for I saw that she had not finished.",
    "She began slowly walking up and down the room her head a little bent\nand that slim supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked.",
    "She\nstopped suddenly and looked up at me.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me do you\u201d she asked.",
    "\u201cWhere I come\nfrom who I was before I married John\u2014anything in fact Well I will\ntell you.",
    "I will make a father confessor of you.",
    "You are kind I\nthink\u2014yes I am sure you are kind.\u201d\n\nSomehow I was not quite as elated as I might have been.",
    "I remembered\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way.",
    "Besides a\nfather confessor should be elderly it is not at all the role for a\nyoung man.",
    "\u201cMy father was English\u201d said Mrs. Cavendish \u201cbut my mother was a\nRussian.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d I said \u201cnow I understand\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstand what\u201d\n\n\u201cA hint of something foreign\u2014different\u2014that there has always been about\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother was very beautiful I believe.",

    "I believe there was\nsome tragedy connected with her death\u2014she took an overdose of some\nsleeping draught by mistake.",
    "However that may be my father was\nbrokenhearted.",
    "Shortly afterwards he went into the Consular Service.",
    "Everywhere he went I went with him.",
    "When I was twentythree I had\nbeen nearly all over the world.",
    "It was a splendid life\u2014I loved it.\u201d\n\nThere was a smile on her face and her head was thrown back.",
    "She seemed\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.",
    "\u201cThen my father died.",
    "He left me very badly off.",
    "I had to go and live\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.\u201d She shuddered.",
    "\u201cYou will understand\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\nbeen.",
    "The narrowness the deadly monotony of it almost drove me mad.\u201d\nShe paused a minute and added in a different tone \u201cAnd then I met\nJohn Cavendish.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that from my aunts\u2019 point of view it was a very good\nmatch for me.",
    "But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\nwith me.",
    "No he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\nmonotony of my life.\u201d\n\nI said nothing and after a moment she went on\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me.",
    "I was quite honest with him.",
    "I told him what\nwas true that I liked him very much that I hoped to come to like him\nmore but that I was not in any way what the world calls \u2018in love\u2019 with\nhim.",
    "He declared that that satisfied him and so\u2014we were married.\u201d\n\nShe waited a long time a little frown had gathered on her forehead.",
    "She seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.",
    "\u201cI think\u2014I am sure\u2014he cared for me at first.",
    "But I suppose we were not\nwell matched.",
    "Almost at once we drifted apart.",
    "He\u2014it is not a pleasing\nthing for my pride but it is the truth\u2014tired of me very soon.\u201d I must\nhave made some murmur of dissent for she went on quickly \u201cOh yes he\ndid Not that it matters now\u2014now that we\u2019ve come to the parting of the\nways.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\nShe answered quietly\n\n\u201cI mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and John are not going to live here\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn may live here but I shall not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to leave him\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why\u201d\n\nShe paused a long time and said at last\n\n\u201cPerhaps\u2014because I want to be\u2014free\u201d\n\nAnd as she spoke I had a sudden vision of broad spaces virgin tracts\nof forests untrodden lands\u2014and a realization of what freedom would\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish.",
    "I seemed to see her for a\nmoment as she was a proud wild creature as untamed by civilization as\nsome shy bird of the hills.",
    "A little cry broke from her lips\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know you don\u2019t know how this hateful place has been prison\nto me\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand\u201d I said \u201cbut\u2014but don\u2019t do anything rash.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh rash\u201d Her voice mocked at my prudence.",
    "Then suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for\n\n\u201cYou know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested\u201d\n\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face blotting out all\nexpression.",
    "\u201cJohn was so kind as to break that to me this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what do you think\u201d I asked feebly.",
    "\u201cOf what\u201d\n\n\u201cOf the arrest\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat should I think Apparently he is a German spy so the gardener\nhad told John.\u201d\n\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless.",
    "Did she\ncare or did she not\n\nShe moved away a step or two and fingered one of the flower vases.",
    "\u201cThese are quite dead.",
    "I must do them again.",
    "Would you mind\nmoving\u2014thank you Mr. Hastings.\u201d And she walked quietly past me out of\nthe window with a cool little nod of dismissal.",
    "No surely she could not care for Bauerstein.",
    "No woman could act her\npart with that icy unconcern.",
    "Poirot did not make his appearance the following morning and there was\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.",
    "But at lunchtime there arrived a new piece of evidence\u2014or rather\nlack of evidence.",
    "We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter which\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death.",
    "Our\nefforts having been in vain we had abandoned the matter hoping that\nit might turn up of itself one day.",
    "And this is just what did happen\nin the shape of a communication which arrived by the second post from\na firm of French music publishers acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\ncheque and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\nof Russian folksongs.",
    "So the last hope of solving the mystery by means\nof Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s correspondence on the fatal evening had to be\nabandoned.",
    "Just before tea I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\ndisappointment but found to my annoyance that he was once more out.",

    "I was getting angry.",
    "He\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.",

    "\u201cSo he has found the extra coffeecup.",
    "That is good.",
    "He has more intelligence than would appear this longfaced Monsieur\nLawrence of yours\u201d\n\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrence\u2019s intelligence but I\nforebore to contradict Poirot and gently took him to task for\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia\u2019s days off.",
    "\u201cIt is true.",

    "You\nwould inherit it wouldn\u2019t you\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh that\u2019s better\u201d said Heavywether with ferocious geniality.",
    "\u201cAnd\nyou\u2019d inherit a good slice of money too wouldn\u2019t you\u201d\n\n\u201cReally Sir Ernest\u201d protested the judge \u201cthese questions are not\nrelevant.\u201d\n\nSir Ernest bowed and having shot his arrow proceeded.",
    "\u201cOn Tuesday the 17th July you went I believe with another guest to\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you\u2014while you happened to be alone for a few seconds\u2014unlock the\npoison cupboard and examine some of the bottles\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014may have done so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put it to you that you did do so\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.",
    "\u201cDid you examine one bottle in particular\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I do not think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful Mr. Cavendish.",
    "I am referring to a little bottle of\nHydrochloride of Strychnine.\u201d\n\nLawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.",
    "\u201cN\u2014o\u2014I am sure I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\nimpress of your fingerprints on it\u201d\n\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.",
    "\u201cI\u2014I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so too Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why did you take it up\u201d\n\n\u201cI once studied to be a doctor.",
    "Such things naturally interest me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh So poisons \u2018naturally interest\u2019 you do they Still you waited to\nbe alone before gratifying that \u2018interest\u2019 of yours\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was pure chance.",
    "If the others had been there I should have done\njust the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill as it happens the others were not there\u201d\n\n\u201cNo but\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact during the whole afternoon you were only alone for a couple\nof minutes and it happened\u2014I say it happened\u2014to be during those two\nminutes that you displayed your \u2018natural interest\u2019 in Hydrochloride of\nStrychnine\u201d\n\nLawrence stammered pitiably.",
    "\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance Sir Ernest observed\n\n\u201cI have nothing more to ask you Mr. Cavendish.\u201d\n\nThis bit of crossexamination had caused great excitement in court.",
    "The\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\ntogether and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\nsilence.",
    "There was little more evidence.",
    "The handwriting experts were called\nupon for their opinion of the signature of \u201cAlfred Inglethorp\u201d in the\nchemist\u2019s poison register.",
    "They all declared unanimously that it was\ncertainly not his handwriting and gave it as their view that it might\nbe that of the prisoner disguised.",
    "Crossexamined they admitted that\nit might be the prisoner\u2019s handwriting cleverly counterfeited.",
    "Sir Ernest Heavywether\u2019s speech in opening the case for the defence was\nnot a long one but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\nmanner.",
    "Never he said in the course of his long experience had he\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence.",
    "Not only was it\nentirely circumstantial but the greater part of it was practically\nunproved.",
    "Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\nimpartially.",
    "The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\nprisoner\u2019s room.",
    "That drawer was an unlocked one as he had pointed\nout and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there.",
    "It was in fact a\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\nthe crime on the prisoner.",
    "The prosecution had been unable to produce a\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson\u2019s.",
    "The quarrel which\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\nadmitted but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\nexaggerated.",
    "His learned friend\u2014Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips\u2014had\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man he would have come\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he and not Mr.\nInglethorp who had been the participator in the quarrel.",
    "He thought\nthe facts had been misrepresented.",
    "What had actually occurred was this.",
    "The prisoner returning to the house on Tuesday evening had been\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\nand Mrs. Inglethorp.",
    "No suspicion had entered the prisoner\u2019s head that\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\nInglethorp.",
    "He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\nquarrels.",
    "The prosecution averred that on Monday July 16th the prisoner had\nentered the chemist\u2019s shop in the village disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.",
    "The prisoner on the contrary was at that time at a lonely spot called\nMarston\u2019s Spinney where he had been summoned by an anonymous note\ncouched in blackmailing terms and threatening to reveal certain\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands.",
    "The prisoner\nhad accordingly gone to the appointed spot and after waiting there\nvainly for half an hour had returned home.",
    "Unfortunately he had met\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\nhis story but luckily he had kept the note and it would be produced\nas evidence.",
    "As for the statement relating to the destruction of the will the\nprisoner had formerly practised at the Bar and was perfectly well\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\nrevoked by his stepmother\u2019s remarriage.",
    "He would call evidence to show\nwho did destroy the will and it was possible that that might open up\nquite a new view of the case.",
    "Finally he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\nother people besides John Cavendish.",
    "He would direct their attention to\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\nstrong if not stronger than that against his brother.",
    "He would now call the prisoner.",
    "John acquitted himself well in the witnessbox.",
    "Under Sir Ernest\u2019s\nskilful handling he told his tale credibly and well.",
    "The anonymous\nnote received by him was produced and handed to the jury to examine.",
    "The readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties and\nthe disagreement with his stepmother lent value to his denials.",
    "At the close of his examination he paused and said\n\n\u201cI should like to make one thing clear.",
    "I utterly reject and disapprove\nof Sir Ernest Heavywether\u2019s insinuations against my brother.",
    "My\nbrother I am convinced had no more to do with the crime than I have.\u201d\n\nSir Ernest merely smiled and noted with a sharp eye that John\u2019s\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.",
    "Then the crossexamination began.",
    "\u201cI understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp.",
    "Is not that very surprising\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so.",
    "I was told there had been a quarrel between my\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp and it never occurred to me that such was\nnot really the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\nconversation\u2014fragments which you must have recognized\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not recognize them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour memory must be unusually short\u201d\n\n\u201cNo but we were both angry and I think said more than we meant.",
    "I\npaid very little attention to my mother\u2019s actual words.\u201d\n\nMr. Philips\u2019 incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill.",
    "He\npassed on to the subject of the note.",
    "\u201cYou have produced this note very opportunely.",
    "Tell me is there\nnothing familiar about the handwriting of it\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\nhandwriting\u2014carelessly disguised\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I do not think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put it to you that it is your own handwriting\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put it to you that anxious to prove an alibi you conceived the\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment and wrote this\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it not a fact that at the time you claim to have been waiting\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot you were really in the\nchemist\u2019s shop in Styles St. Mary where you purchased strychnine in\nthe name of Alfred Inglethorp\u201d\n\n\u201cNo that is a lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put it to you that wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s clothes with\na black beard trimmed to resemble his you were there\u2014and signed the\nregister in his name\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is absolutely untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I will leave the remarkable similarity of handwriting between\nthe note the register and your own to the consideration of the\njury\u201d said Mr. Philips and sat down with the air of a man who has\ndone his duty but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\nperjury.",
    "After this as it was growing late the case was adjourned till Monday.",
    "Poirot I noticed was looking profoundly discouraged.",
    "He had that\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.",
    "\u201cWhat is it Poirot\u201d I inquired.",
    "\u201cAh mon ami things are going badly badly.\u201d\n\nIn spite of myself my heart gave a leap of relief.",
    "Evidently there was\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.",
    "When we reached the house my little friend waved aside Mary\u2019s offer of\ntea.",
    "\u201cNo I thank you madame.",
    "I will mount to my room.\u201d\n\nI followed him.",
    "Still frowning he went across to the desk and took out\na small pack of patience cards.",
    "Then he drew up a chair to the table\nand to my utter amazement began solemnly to build card houses\n\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily and he said at once\n\n\u201cNo mon ami I am not in my second childhood I steady my nerves\nthat is all.",
    "This employment requires precision of the fingers.",
    "With\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain.",
    "And never have I\nneeded that more than now\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the trouble\u201d I asked.",
    "With a great thump on the table Poirot demolished his carefully built\nup edifice.",
    "\u201cIt is this mon ami That I can build card houses seven stories\nhigh but I cannot\u201d\u2014thump\u2014\u201cfind\u201d\u2014thump\u2014\u201c that last link of which I\nspoke to you.\u201d\n\nI could not quite tell what to say so I held my peace and he began\nslowly building up the cards again speaking in jerks as he did so.",
    "\u201cIt is done\u2014so By placing\u2014one card\u2014on another\u2014with\nmathematical\u2014precision\u201d\n\nI watched the card house rising under his hands story by story.",
    "He\nnever hesitated or faltered.",
    "It was really almost like a conjuring\ntrick.",
    "\u201cWhat a steady hand you\u2019ve got\u201d I remarked.",
    "\u201cI believe I\u2019ve only seen\nyour hand shake once.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn an occasion when I was enraged without doubt\u201d observed Poirot\nwith great placidity.",
    "\u201cYes indeed You were in a towering rage.",
    "Do you remember It was when\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatchcase in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\nbedroom had been forced.",
    "You stood by the mantelpiece twiddling the\nthings on it in your usual fashion and your hand shook like a leaf I\nmust say\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nBut I stopped suddenly.",
    "For Poirot uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\ncry again annihilated his masterpiece of cards and putting his hands\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards apparently suffering the\nkeenest agony.",
    "\u201cGood heavens Poirot\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cWhat is the matter Are you taken\nill\u201d\n\n\u201cNo no\u201d he gasped.",
    "\u201cIt is\u2014it is\u2014that I have an idea\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u201d I exclaimed much relieved.",
    "\u201cOne of your \u2018little ideas\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAh ma foi no\u201d replied Poirot frankly.",
    "\u201cThis time it is an idea\ngigantic Stupendous And you\u2014you my friend have given it to me\u201d\n\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms he kissed me warmly on both cheeks\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.",
    "Mary Cavendish entered at that moment.",
    "\u201cWhat is the matter with Monsieur Poirot He rushed past me crying\nout \u2018A garage For the love of Heaven direct me to a garage madame\u2019\nAnd before I could answer he had dashed out into the street.\u201d\n\nI hurried to the window.",
    "True enough there he was tearing down the\nstreet hatless and gesticulating as he went.",
    "I turned to Mary with a\ngesture of despair.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute.",
    "There he goes\nround the corner\u201d\n\nOur eyes met and we stared helplessly at one another.",
    "\u201cWhat can be the matter\u201d\n\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "He was building card houses when suddenly he said he\nhad an idea and rushed off as you saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said Mary \u201cI expect he will be back before dinner.\u201d\n\nBut night fell and Poirot had not returned.",
    "CHAPTER XII.",
    "THE LAST LINK\n\n\nPoirot\u2019s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly.",
    "Sunday morning\nwore away and still he did not reappear.",
    "But about three o\u2019clock a\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window to see\nPoirot alighting from a car accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye.",
    "The\nlittle man was transformed.",
    "He radiated an absurd complacency.",
    "He bowed\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.",
    "\u201cMadame I have your permission to hold a little r\u00e9union in the\nsalon It is necessary for everyone to attend.\u201d\n\nMary smiled sadly.",
    "\u201cYou know Monsieur Poirot that you have carte blanche in every\nway.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are too amiable madame.\u201d\n\nStill beaming Poirot marshalled us all into the drawingroom bringing\nforward chairs as he did so.",
    "\u201cMiss Howard\u2014here.",
    "Mademoiselle Cynthia.",
    "Monsieur Lawrence.",
    "The good\nDorcas.",
    "And Annie.",
    "Bien We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\nuntil Mr. Inglethorp arrives.",
    "I have sent him a note.\u201d\n\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.",
    "\u201cIf that man comes into the house I leave it\u201d\n\n\u201cNo no\u201d Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.",
    "Finally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair.",
    "A few minutes\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.",
    "The company once assembled Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\npopular lecturer and bowed politely to his audience.",
    "\u201cMessieurs mesdames as you all know I was called in by Monsieur\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case.",
    "I at once examined the bedroom\nof the deceased which by the advice of the doctors had been kept\nlocked and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\noccurred.",
    "I found first a fragment of green material second a stain\non the carpet near the window still damp thirdly an empty box of\nbromide powders.",
    "\u201cTo take the fragment of green material first I found it caught in the\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia.",
    "I handed the fragment over to the\npolice who did not consider it of much importance.",
    "Nor did they\nrecognize it for what it was\u2014a piece torn from a green land armlet.\u201d\n\nThere was a little stir of excitement.",
    "\u201cNow there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land\u2014Mrs.",
    "Cavendish.",
    "Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\ndeceased\u2019s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\nCynthia\u2019s room.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that door was bolted on the inside\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cWhen I examined the room yes.",
    "But in the first place we have only her\nword for it since it was she who tried that particular door and\nreported it fastened.",
    "In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across.",
    "I took an early opportunity of\nverifying my conjectures.",
    "To begin with the fragment corresponds\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s armlet.",
    "Also at the inquest\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard from her own room the fall\nof the table by the bed.",
    "I took an early opportunity of testing that\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\nthe building just outside Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s door.",
    "I myself in company\nwith the police went to the deceased\u2019s room and whilst there I\napparently accidentally knocked over the table in question but found\nthat as I had expected Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.",
    "This confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\nthe tragedy.",
    "In fact I was convinced that far from having been in her\nown room Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased\u2019s room when the\nalarm was given.\u201d\n\nI shot a quick glance at Mary.",
    "She was very pale but smiling.",
    "\u201cI proceeded to reason on that assumption.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish is in her\nmotherinlaw\u2019s room.",
    "We will say that she is seeking for something and\nhas not yet found it.",
    "Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\nwith an alarming paroxysm.",
    "She flings out her arm overturning the bed\ntable and then pulls desperately at the bell.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish\nstartled drops her candle scattering the grease on the carpet.",
    "She\npicks it up and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s room\nclosing the door behind her.",
    "She hurries out into the passage for the\nservants must not find her where she is.",
    "But it is too late Already\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.",
    "What can she do Quick as thought she hurries back to the young girl\u2019s\nroom and starts shaking her awake.",
    "The hastily aroused household come\ntrooping down the passage.",
    "They are all busily battering at Mrs.\nInglethorp\u2019s door.",
    "It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\narrived with the rest but\u2014and this is significant\u2014I can find no one\nwho saw her come from the other wing.\u201d He looked at Mary Cavendish.",
    "\u201cAm\nI right madame\u201d\n\nShe bowed her head.",
    "\u201cQuite right monsieur.",
    "You understand that if I had thought I would\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts I would have done so.",
    "But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\ninnocence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a sense that is correct madame.",
    "But it cleared my mind of many\nmisconceptions and left me free to see other facts in their true\nsignificance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe will\u201d cried Lawrence.",
    "\u201cThen it was you Mary who destroyed the\nwill\u201d\n\nShe shook her head and Poirot shook his also.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cThere is only one person who could possibly\nhave destroyed that will\u2014Mrs.",
    "Inglethorp herself\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cShe had only made it out that very\nafternoon\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless mon ami it was Mrs. Inglethorp.",
    "Because in no other\nway can you account for the fact that on one of the hottest days of\nthe year Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.\u201d\n\nI gave a gasp.",
    "What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\nbeing incongruous Poirot was continuing\n\n\u201cThe temperature on that day messieurs was 80 degrees in the shade.",
    "Yet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire Why Because she wished to destroy\nsomething and could think of no other way.",
    "You will remember that in\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles no waste paper\nwas thrown away.",
    "There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\ndocument such as a will.",
    "The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\nMrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\ndestroy some important document\u2014possibly a will.",
    "So the discovery of\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me.",
    "I did not of\ncourse know at the time that the will in question had only been made\nthis afternoon and I will admit that when I learnt that fact I fell\ninto a grievous error.",
    "I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\nquarrel she had that afternoon and that therefore the quarrel took\nplace after and not before the making of the will.",
    "\u201cHere as we know I was wrong and I was forced to abandon that idea.",
    "I faced the problem from a new standpoint.",
    "Now at four o\u2019clock Dorcas\noverheard her mistress saying angrily \u2018You need not think that any\nfear of publicity or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\u201d\nI conjectured and conjectured rightly that these words were\naddressed not to her husband but to Mr. John Cavendish.",
    "At five\no\u2019clock an hour later she uses almost the same words but the\nstandpoint is different.",
    "She admits to Dorcas \u2018I don\u2019t know what to\ndo scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.\u2019 At four\no\u2019clock she has been angry but completely mistress of herself.",
    "At five\no\u2019clock she is in violent distress and speaks of having had a great\nshock.",
    "\u201cLooking at the matter psychologically I drew one deduction which I\nwas convinced was correct.",
    "The second \u2018scandal\u2019 she spoke of was not\nthe same as the first\u2014and it concerned herself\n\n\u201cLet us reconstruct.",
    "At four o\u2019clock Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\nson and threatens to denounce him to his wife\u2014who by the way\noverheard the greater part of the conversation.",
    "At fourthirty Mrs.\nInglethorp in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills\nmakes a will in favour of her husband which the two gardeners witness.",
    "At five o\u2019clock Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\nagitation with a slip of paper\u2014\u2018a letter\u2019 Dorcas thinks\u2014in her hand\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.",
    "Presumably then between fourthirty and five o\u2019clock something has\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling since she is now\nas anxious to destroy the will as she was before to make it.",
    "What was\nthat something\n\n\u201cAs far as we know she was quite alone during that halfhour.",
    "Nobody\nentered or left that boudoir.",
    "What then occasioned this sudden change\nof sentiment\n\n\u201cOne can only guess but I believe my guess to be correct.",
    "Mrs.\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk.",
    "We know this because later she\nasked Dorcas to bring her some.",
    "Now in the opposite corner of the room\nstood her husband\u2019s desk\u2014locked.",
    "She was anxious to find some stamps\nand according to my theory she tried her own keys in the desk.",
    "That\none of them fitted I know.",
    "She therefore opened the desk and in\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else\u2014that slip of\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand and which assuredly was never meant\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s eyes.",
    "On the other hand Mrs. Cavendish believed\nthat the slip of paper to which her motherinlaw clung so tenaciously\nwas a written proof of her own husband\u2019s infidelity.",
    "She demanded it\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her quite truly that it had nothing\nto do with that matter.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her.",
    "She thought\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson.",
    "Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\nvery resolute woman and behind her mask of reserve she was madly\njealous of her husband.",
    "She determined to get hold of that paper at all\ncosts and in this resolution chance came to her aid.",
    "She happened to\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s despatchcase which had been lost\nthat morning.",
    "She knew that her motherinlaw invariably kept all\nimportant papers in this particular case.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Cavendish therefore made her plans as only a woman driven\ndesperate through jealousy could have done.",
    "Some time in the evening\nshe unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s room.",
    "Possibly she applied oil to the hinges for I found that it opened\nquite noiselessly when I tried it.",
    "She put off her project until the\nearly hours of the morning as being safer since the servants were\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time.",
    "She dressed\ncompletely in her land kit and made her way quietly through\nMademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.\u201d\n\nHe paused a moment and Cynthia interrupted\n\n\u201cBut I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you were drugged mademoiselle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrugged\u201d\n\n\u201cMais oui\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember\u201d\u2014he addressed us collectively again\u2014\u201cthat through all the\ntumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept.",
    "That admitted of\ntwo possibilities.",
    "Either her sleep was feigned\u2014which I did not\nbelieve\u2014or her unconsciousness was induced by artificial means.",
    "\u201cWith this latter idea in my mind I examined all the coffeecups most\ncarefully remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before.",
    "I took a sample from\neach cup and had them analysed\u2014with no result.",
    "I had counted the cups\ncarefully in the event of one having been removed.",
    "Six persons had\ntaken coffee and six cups were duly found.",
    "I had to confess myself\nmistaken.",
    "\u201cThen I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.",
    "Coffee had been brought in for seven persons not six for Dr.\nBauerstein had been there that evening.",
    "This changed the face of the\nwhole affair for there was now one cup missing.",
    "The servants noticed\nnothing since Annie the housemaid who took in the coffee brought in\nseven cups not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it whereas\nDorcas who cleared them away the following morning found six as\nusual\u2014or strictly speaking she found five the sixth being the one\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room.",
    "\u201cI was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.",
    "I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\ncups found contained sugar which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\nher coffee.",
    "My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\n\u2018salt\u2019 on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\nInglethorp\u2019s room.",
    "I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa and\nsent it to be analysed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein\u201d said Lawrence\nquickly.",
    "\u201cNot exactly.",
    "The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\nwas or was not present.",
    "He did not have it tested as I did for a\nnarcotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a narcotic\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Here is the analyst\u2019s report.",
    "Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe\nbut effectual narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\nCynthia.",
    "And it is possible that she had a mauvais quart d\u2019heure in\nconsequence Imagine her feelings when her motherinlaw is suddenly\ntaken ill and dies and immediately after she hears the word \u2018Poison\u2019\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\nperfectly harmless but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s death lay at her door.",
    "She\nis seized with panic and under its influence she hurries downstairs\nand quickly drops the coffeecup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\nCynthia into a large brass vase where it is discovered later by\nMonsieur Lawrence.",
    "The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch.",
    "Too\nmany eyes are upon her.",
    "Guess at her relief when strychnine is\nmentioned and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\ndoing.",
    "\u201cWe are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\nbeing so long in making their appearance.",
    "A narcotic taken with\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.\u201d\n\nPoirot paused.",
    "Mary looked up at him the colour slowly rising in her\nface.",
    "\u201cAll you have said is quite true Monsieur Poirot.",
    "It was the most\nawful hour of my life.",
    "I shall never forget it.",
    "But you are wonderful.",
    "I understand now\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\nPoirot eh But you would not trust me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see everything now\u201d said Lawrence.",
    "\u201cThe drugged cocoa taken on top\nof the poisoned coffee amply accounts for the delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.",
    "But was the coffee poisoned or was it not We come to a\nlittle difficulty here since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d The cry of surprise was universal.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\nInglethorp\u2019s room There were some peculiar points about that stain.",
    "It\nwas still damp it exhaled a strong odour of coffee and imbedded in\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china.",
    "What had\nhappened was plain to me for not two minutes before I had placed my\nlittle case on the table near the window and the table tilting up\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot.",
    "In\nexactly the same way Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\non reaching her room the night before and the treacherous table had\nplayed her the same trick.",
    "\u201cWhat happened next is mere guess work on my part but I should say\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\ntable by the bed.",
    "Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind she\nheated up her cocoa and drank it off then and there.",
    "Now we are faced\nwith a new problem.",
    "We know the cocoa contained no strychnine.",
    "The\ncoffee was never drunk.",
    "Yet the strychnine must have been administered\nbetween seven and nine o\u2019clock that evening.",
    "What third medium was\nthere\u2014a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it\u201d Poirot looked round the\nroom and then answered himself impressively.",
    "\u201cHer medicine\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\ntonic\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cThere was no need to introduce it.",
    "It was already there\u2014in the\nmixture.",
    "The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins.",
    "To make that clear to you I will\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster\n\n\u201c\u2018The following prescription has become famous in text books\n\n\n          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.",

    "A lady\nin England lost her life by taking a similar mixture the precipitated\nstrychnine collected at the bottom and in taking the last dose she\nswallowed nearly all of it\n\n\u201cNow there was of course no bromide in Dr. Wilkins\u2019 prescription but\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders.",
    "One\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine as the book describes\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose.",
    "You will learn later that\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s medicine was always\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle but to leave the sediment at\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.",
    "\u201cThroughout the case there have been evidences that the tragedy was\nintended to take place on Monday evening.",
    "On that day Mrs.\nInglethorp\u2019s bell wire was neatly cut and on Monday evening\nMademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends so that Mrs.\nInglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing completely\nshut off from help of any kind and would have died in all\nprobability before medical aid could have been summoned.",
    "But in her\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\nforgot to take her medicine and the next day she lunched away from\nhome so that the last\u2014and fatal\u2014dose was actually taken twentyfour\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer and it is owing\nto that delay that the final proof\u2014the last link of the chain\u2014is now in\nmy hands.\u201d\n\nAmid breathless excitement he held out three thin strips of paper.",
    "\u201cA letter in the murderer\u2019s own handwriting mes amis Had it been a\nlittle clearer in its terms it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp\nwarned in time would have escaped.",
    "As it was she realized her danger\nbut not the manner of it.\u201d\n\nIn the deathly silence Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and\nclearing his throat read\n\nDearest Evelyn\n\n    \u2018You will be anxious at hearing nothing.",
    "It is all right\u2014only it\n    will be tonight instead of last night.",
    "You understand.",
    "There\u2019s a\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way.",
    "No\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me.",
    "That idea of yours\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius But we must be very\n    circumspect.",
    "A false step\u2014\u2014\u2019\n\n\n\u201cHere my friends the letter breaks off.",
    "Doubtless the writer was\ninterrupted but there can be no question as to his identity.",
    "We all\nknow this handwriting and\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.",
    "\u201cYou devil How did you get it\u201d\n\nA chair was overturned.",
    "Poirot skipped nimbly aside.",
    "A quick movement\non his part and his assailant fell with a crash.",
    "\u201cMessieurs mesdames\u201d said Poirot with a flourish \u201clet me\nintroduce you to the murderer Mr. Alfred Inglethorp\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.",
    "POIROT EXPLAINS\n\n\n\u201cPoirot you old villain\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019ve half a mind to strangle you\nWhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done\u201d\n\nWe were sitting in the library.",
    "Several hectic days lay behind us.",
    "In\nthe room below John and Mary were together once more while Alfred\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody.",
    "Now at last I had Poirot\nto myself and could relieve my still burning curiosity.",
    "Poirot did not answer me for a moment but at last he said\n\n\u201cI did not deceive you mon ami.",
    "At most I permitted you to deceive\nyourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but why\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it is difficult to explain.",
    "You see my friend you have a\nnature so honest and a countenance so transparent that\u2014enfin to\nconceal your feelings is impossible If I had told you my ideas the\nvery first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\nwould have\u2014in your so expressive idiom\u2014\u2018smelt a rat\u2019 And then\nbonjour to our chances of catching him\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friend\u201d besought Poirot \u201cI implore you do not enrage yourself\nYour help has been of the most invaluable.",
    "It is but the extremely\nbeautiful nature that you have which made me pause.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d I grumbled a little mollified.",
    "\u201cI still think you might have\ngiven me a hint.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I did my friend.",
    "Several hints.",
    "You would not take them.",
    "Think\nnow did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty Did I\nnot on the contrary tell you that he would almost certainly be\nacquitted\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\nbringing the murderer to justice Was it not plain to you that I was\nspeaking of two entirely different persons\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d I said \u201cit was not plain to me\u201d\n\n\u201cThen again\u201d continued Poirot \u201cat the beginning did I not repeat to\nyou several times that I didn\u2019t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested now\nThat should have conveyed something to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "To begin with whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\ndeath her husband would benefit the most.",
    "There was no getting away\nfrom that.",
    "When I went up to Styles with you that first day I had no\nidea as to how the crime had been committed but from what I knew of\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\nconnect him with it.",
    "When I arrived at the ch\u00e2teau I realized at once\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will and there by the\nway you cannot complain my friend for I tried my best to force on\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes yes\u201d I said impatiently.",
    "\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell my friend as I say my views as to Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s guilt were\nvery much shaken.",
    "There was in fact so much evidence against him that\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did you change your mind\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I found that the more efforts I made to clear him the more\nefforts he made to get himself arrested.",
    "Then when I discovered that\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter I was quite sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply this.",
    "If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\nwith Mrs. Raikes his silence was perfectly comprehensible.",
    "But when I\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\nwas attracted by the farmer\u2019s pretty wife his silence bore quite a\ndifferent interpretation.",
    "It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\nof the scandal as no possible scandal could attach to him.",
    "This\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think and I was slowly forced to\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested.",
    "Eh bien\nfrom that moment I was equally determined that he should not be\narrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute.",
    "I don\u2019t see why he wished to be arrested\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause mon ami it is the law of your country that a man once\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence.",
    "Aha but it\nwas clever\u2014his idea Assuredly he is a man of method.",
    "See here he\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected so he conceived\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\nagainst himself.",
    "He wished to be arrested.",
    "He would then produce his\nirreproachable alibi\u2014and hey presto he was safe for life\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I still don\u2019t see how he managed to prove his alibi and yet go to\nthe chemist\u2019s shop\u201d\n\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.",
    "\u201cIs it possible My poor friend You have not yet realized that it was\nMiss Howard who went to the chemist\u2019s shop\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Howard\u201d\n\n\u201cBut certainly.",
    "Who else It was most easy for her.",
    "She is of a good\nheight her voice is deep and manly moreover remember she and\nInglethorp are cousins and there is a distinct resemblance between\nthem especially in their gait and bearing.",
    "It was simplicity itself.",
    "They are a clever pair\u201d\n\n\u201cI am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\ndone\u201d I remarked.",
    "\u201cBon I will reconstruct for you as far as possible.",
    "I am inclined to\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair.",
    "You remember\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor Possibly she\ndispensed his medicines for him or she may have taken the idea from\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\nstudying for her exam.",
    "Anyway she was familiar with the fact that the\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\nthe precipitation of the latter.",
    "Probably the idea came to her quite\nsuddenly.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders which she\noccasionally took at night.",
    "What could be easier than quietly to\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s large sized\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot\u2019s The risk is practically\nnil.",
    "The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later.",
    "If\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine they will have\nforgotten it by that time.",
    "Miss Howard will have engineered her\nquarrel and departed from the house.",
    "The lapse of time and her\nabsence will defeat all suspicion.",
    "Yes it was a clever idea If they\nhad left it alone it is possible the crime might never have been\nbrought home to them.",
    "But they were not satisfied.",
    "They tried to be too\nclever\u2014and that was their undoing.\u201d\n\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette his eyes fixed on the ceiling.",
    "\u201cThey arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish by buying\nstrychnine at the village chemist\u2019s and signing the register in his\nhandwriting.",
    "\u201cOn Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine.",
    "On\nMonday therefore at six o\u2019clock Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village.",
    "Miss\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards.",
    "At six\no\u2019clock Miss Howard disguised as Alfred Inglethorp enters the\nchemist\u2019s shop with her story about a dog obtains the strychnine and\nwrites the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John\u2019s handwriting which she\nhad previously studied carefully.",
    "\u201cBut as it will never do if John too can prove an alibi she writes\nhim an anonymous note\u2014still copying his handwriting\u2014which takes him to\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\nhim.",
    "\u201cSo far all goes well.",
    "Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham.",
    "Alfred\nInglethorp returns to Styles.",
    "There is nothing that can compromise him\nin any way since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine which\nafter all is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\nCavendish.",
    "\u201cBut now a hitch occurs.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\nthat night.",
    "The broken bell Cynthia\u2019s absence\u2014arranged by Inglethorp\nthrough his wife\u2014all these are wasted.",
    "And then\u2014he makes his slip.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Inglethorp is out and he sits down to write to his accomplice\nwho he fears may be in a panic at the nonsuccess of their plan.",
    "It\nis probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.",
    "Caught in the act and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\ndesk.",
    "He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\nagain and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\nhe could snatch it up.",
    "So he goes out and walks in the woods little\ndreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk and discover the\nincriminating document.",
    "\u201cBut this as we know is what happened.",
    "Mrs. Inglethorp reads it and\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard though\nunfortunately the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\nher mind.",
    "She knows that she is in danger\u2014but is ignorant of where the\ndanger lies.",
    "She decides to say nothing to her husband but sits down\nand writes to her solicitor asking him to come on the morrow and she\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\nmade.",
    "She keeps the fatal letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was to discover that letter then that her husband forced the lock\nof the despatchcase\u201d\n\n\u201cYes and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\nrealized its importance.",
    "That letter excepted there was absolutely\nnothing to connect him with the crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I can\u2019t make out why didn\u2019t he destroy it at\nonce when he got hold of it\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he did not dare take the biggest risk of all\u2014that of keeping\nit on his own person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at it from his point of view.",
    "I have discovered that there were\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it\u2014the five\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene for before\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs and would have seen anyone who\npassed going to the right wing.",
    "Figure to yourself the scene He enters\nthe room unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys\u2014they\nwere all much alike.",
    "He hurries to the despatchcase\u2014it is locked and\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen.",
    "That is a terrible blow to him for it\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\nhoped.",
    "But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\nof that damning piece of evidence.",
    "Quickly he forces the lock with a\npenknife and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\nfor.",
    "\u201cBut now a fresh dilemma arises he dare not keep that piece of paper\non him.",
    "He may be seen leaving the room\u2014he may be searched.",
    "If the\npaper is found on him it is certain doom.",
    "Probably at this minute\ntoo he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\nboudoir.",
    "He must act quickly.",
    "Where can he hide this terrible slip of\npaper The contents of the wastepaperbasket are kept and in any case\nare sure to be examined.",
    "There are no means of destroying it and he\ndare not keep it.",
    "He looks round and he sees\u2014what do you think mon\nami\u201d\n\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cIn a moment he has torn the letter into long thin strips and rolling\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\nspills in the vase on the mantlepiece.\u201d\n\nI uttered an exclamation.",
    "\u201cNo one would think of looking there\u201d Poirot continued.",
    "\u201cAnd he will\nbe able at his leisure to come back and destroy this solitary piece\nof evidence against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen all the time it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\nbedroom under our very noses\u201d I cried.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYes my friend.",
    "That is where I discovered my \u2018last link\u2019 and I owe\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but I don\u2019t see\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo but I saw.",
    "Do you know my friend I remembered that earlier in\nthe morning when we had been there together I had straightened all\nthe objects on the mantelpiece.",
    "And if they were already straightened\nthere would be no need to straighten them again unless in the\nmeantime someone else had touched them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me\u201d I murmured \u201cso that is the explanation of your\nextraordinary behaviour.",
    "You rushed down to Styles and found it still\nthere\u201d\n\n\u201cYes and it was a race for time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I still can\u2019t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh but he had no opportunity.",
    "I saw to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\nconfidence on the subject\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell my friend I saw there was just one chance.",
    "I was not sure then\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not but if he was I reasoned that he\nwould not have the paper on him but would have hidden it somewhere\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\nprevent his destroying it.",
    "He was already under suspicion and by\nmaking the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\ndetectives who would be watching him unceasingly and being himself\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\nthe document.",
    "He was therefore forced to depart from the house leaving\nit in the spill vase.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but Miss Howard did not know of the paper\u2019s existence.",
    "In\naccordance with their prearranged plan she never spoke to Alfred\nInglethorp.",
    "They were supposed to be deadly enemies and until John\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\nmeeting.",
    "Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp hoping that\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hidingplace.",
    "But he was too\nclever to take any chances.",
    "The paper was safe where it was since no\none had thought of looking there in the first week it was not likely\nthey would do so afterwards.",
    "But for your lucky remark we might never\nhave been able to bring him to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that now but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\nHoward\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy what was there to lie about\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw that letter Do you recall its general appearance\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014more or less.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will recollect then that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\ndistinctive hand and left large clear spaces between her words.",
    "But if\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\n\u2018July 17th\u2019 is quite different in this respect.",
    "Do you see what I\nmean\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d I confessed \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th but on\nthe 7th\u2014the day after Miss Howard\u2019s departure The \u20181\u2019 was written in\nbefore the \u20187\u2019 to turn it into the \u201817th\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is exactly what I asked myself.",
    "Why does Miss Howard suppress the\nletter written on the 17th and produce this faked one instead Because\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th.",
    "Why again And at\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind.",
    "You will remember my saying that it\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet\u201d I cried indignantly \u201cafter that you gave me two reasons\nwhy Miss Howard could not have committed the crime\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd very good reasons too\u201d replied Poirot.",
    "\u201cFor a long time they were\na stumblingblock to me until I remembered a very significant fact\nthat she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins.",
    "She could not have\ncommitted the crime singlehanded but the reasons against that did not\ndebar her from being an accomplice.",
    "And then there was that rather\novervehement hatred of hers It concealed a very opposite emotion.",
    "There was undoubtedly a tie of passion between them long before he\ncame to Styles.",
    "They had already arranged their infamous plot\u2014that he\nshould marry this rich but rather foolish old lady induce her to make\na will leaving her money to him and then gain their ends by a very\ncleverly conceived crime.",
    "If all had gone as they planned they would\nprobably have left England and lived together on their poor victim\u2019s\nmoney.",
    "\u201cThey are a very astute and unscrupulous pair.",
    "While suspicion was to\nbe directed against him she would be making quiet preparations for a\nvery different d\u00e9nouement.",
    "She arrives from Middlingham with all the\ncompromising items in her possession.",
    "No suspicion attaches to her.",
    "No\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house.",
    "She hides the\nstrychnine and glasses in John\u2019s room.",
    "She puts the beard in the attic.",
    "She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John\u201d I\nremarked.",
    "\u201cIt would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\nhome to Lawrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but that was mere chance.",
    "All the evidence against him arose out\nof pure accident.",
    "It must in fact have been distinctly annoying to\nthe pair of schemers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis manner was unfortunate\u201d I observed thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "You realize of course what was at the back of that\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\nthe crime\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d I exclaimed astonished.",
    "\u201cImpossible\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all.",
    "I myself nearly had the same idea.",
    "It was in my mind when\nI asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will.",
    "Then there were\nthe bromide powders which she had made up and her clever male\nimpersonations as Dorcas recounted them to us.",
    "There was really more\nevidence against her than anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are joking Poirot\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\nfirst entered his mother\u2019s room on the fatal night It was because\nwhilst his mother lay there obviously poisoned he saw over your\nshoulder that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s room was unbolted.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he declared that he saw it bolted\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cExactly\u201d said Poirot dryly.",
    "\u201cAnd that was just what confirmed my\nsuspicion that it was not.",
    "He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why should he shield her\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he is in love with her.\u201d\n\nI laughed.",
    "\u201cThere Poirot you are quite wrong I happen to know for a fact that\nfar from being in love with her he positively dislikes her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you that mon ami\u201d\n\n\u201cCynthia herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cLa pauvre petite And she was concerned\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said that she did not mind at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen she certainly did mind very much\u201d remarked Poirot.",
    "\u201cThey are\nlike that\u2014les femmes\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cBut why It was most obvious.",
    "Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\nbrother He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\nwas in love with Monsieur John.",
    "When he entered his mother\u2019s room and\nsaw her obviously poisoned he jumped to the conclusion that\nMademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter.",
    "He was nearly\ndriven desperate.",
    "First he crushed the coffeecup to powder under his\nfeet remembering that she had gone up with his mother the night\nbefore and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\ncontents.",
    "Thenceforward he strenuously and quite uselessly upheld\nthe theory of \u2018Death from natural causes\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about the \u2018extra coffeecup\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it but\nI had to make sure.",
    "Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant\nbut on reflection he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\nextra coffeecup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.",
    "And he was perfectly right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing more.",
    "What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were of course an accusation against her husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me Poirot\u201d I said with a sigh \u201cI think you have explained\neverything.",
    "I am glad it has all ended so happily.",
    "Even John and his\nwife are reconciled.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you mean\u2014thanks to you\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear friend do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\ntrial which has brought them together again That John Cavendish still\nloved his wife I was convinced.",
    "Also that she was equally in love\nwith him.",
    "But they had drifted very far apart.",
    "It all arose from a\nmisunderstanding.",
    "She married him without love.",
    "He knew it.",
    "He is a\nsensitive man in his way he would not force himself upon her if she\ndid not want him.",
    "And as he withdrew her love awoke.",
    "But they are\nboth unusually proud and their pride held them inexorably apart.",
    "He\ndrifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes and she deliberately\ncultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein.",
    "Do you remember the day of\nJohn Cavendish\u2019s arrest when you found me deliberating over a big\ndecision\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I quite understood your distress.\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon me mon ami but you did not understand it in the least.",
    "I\nwas trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\nonce.",
    "I could have cleared him\u2014though it might have meant a failure to\nconvict the real criminals.",
    "They were entirely in the dark as to my\nreal attitude up to the very last moment\u2014which partly accounts for my\nsuccess.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\nbrought to trial\u201d\n\n\u201cYes my friend.",
    "But I eventually decided in favour of \u2018a woman\u2019s\nhappiness\u2019.",
    "Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.\u201d\n\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement.",
    "The colossal cheek of the\nlittle man Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness\n\n\u201cI perceive your thoughts mon ami\u201d said Poirot smiling at me.",
    "\u201cNo\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing And you are\nwrong in condemning it.",
    "The happiness of one man and one woman is the\ngreatest thing in all the world.\u201d\n\nHis words took me back to earlier events.",
    "I remembered Mary as she lay\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa listening listening.",
    "There had come\nthe sound of the bell below.",
    "She had started up.",
    "Poirot had opened the\ndoor and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently.",
    "\u201cYes madame\u201d\nhe said.",
    "\u201cI have brought him back to you.\u201d He had stood aside and as I\nwent out I had seen the look in Mary\u2019s eyes as John Cavendish had\ncaught his wife in his arms.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you are right Poirot\u201d I said gently.",
    "\u201cYes it is the\ngreatest thing in the world.\u201d\n\nSuddenly there was a tap at the door and Cynthia peeped in.",
    "\u201cI\u2014I only\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in\u201d I said springing up.",
    "She came in but did not sit down.",
    "\u201cI\u2014only wanted to tell you something\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments then suddenly\nexclaiming \u201cYou dears\u201d kissed first me and then Poirot and rushed\nout of the room again.",
    "\u201cWhat on earth does this mean\u201d I asked surprised.",
    "It was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia but the publicity of the\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.",
    "\u201cIt means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\nher as much as she thought\u201d replied Poirot philosophically.",
    "\u201cBut\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHere he is.\u201d\n\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.",
    "\u201cEh Monsieur Lawrence\u201d called Poirot.",
    "\u201cWe must congratulate you is\nit not so\u201d\n\nLawrence blushed and then smiled awkwardly.",
    "A man in love is a sorry\nspectacle.",
    "Now Cynthia had looked charming.",
    "I sighed.",
    "\u201cWhat is it mon ami\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing\u201d I said sadly.",
    "\u201cThey are two delightful women\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd neither of them is for you\u201d finished Poirot.",
    "\u201cNever mind.",
    "Console\nyourself my friend.",
    "We may hunt together again who knows And then\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\nTHE END"
