    "CROOKED HOUSE\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nI first came to know Sophia Leonides in Egypt towards the end of the\nwar.",
    "She held a fairly high administrative post in one of the Foreign\nOffice departments out there.",
    "I knew her first in an official capacity\nand I soon appreciated the efficiency that had brought her to the\nposition she held in spite of her youth she was at that time just\ntwentytwo.",
    "Besides being extremely easy to look at she had a clear mind and a\ndry sense of humour that I found very delightful.",
    "We became friends.",
    "She was a person whom it was extraordinarily easy to talk to and we\nenjoyed our dinners and occasional dances very much.",
    "All this I knew it was not until I was ordered East at the close of the\nEuropean war that I knew something else  that I loved Sophia and that\nI wanted to marry her.",
    "We were dining at Shepheards when I made this discovery.",
    "It did not\ncome to me with any shock of surprise but more as the recognition of\na fact with which I had been long familiar.",
    "I looked at her with new eyes\n but I saw what I had already known for a long time.",
    "I liked everything I\n\n\fsaw.",
    "The dark crisp hair that sprang up proudly from her forehead the\nvivid blue eyes the small square fighting chin and the straight nose.",
    "I liked the well cut light grey tailormade and the crisp white shirt.",
    "She\nlooked refreshingly English and that appealed to me strongly after\nthree years without seeing my native land.",
    "Nobody I thought could be\nmore English  and even as I was thinking exactly that I suddenly\nwondered if in fact she was or indeed could be as English as she\nlooked.",
    "Does the real thing ever have the perfection of a stage\nperformance\n\nI realised that much and freely as we had talked together discussing\nideas our likes and dislikes the future our immediate friends and\nacquaintances  Sophia had never mentioned her home or her family.",
    "She knew all about me she was as I have indicated a good listener\nbut about her I knew nothing.",
    "She had I supposed the usual\nbackground but she had never talked about it.",
    "And until this moment I\nhad never realised the fact.",
    "Sophia asked me what I was thinking about.",
    "I replied truthfully You.",
    "I see she said.",
    "And she sounded as though she did see.",
    "We may not meet again for a couple of years I said.",
    "I dont know\nwhen I shall get back to England.",
    "But as soon as I do get back the first\nthing I shall do will be to come and see you and ask you to marry me.",
    "She took it without batting an eyelash.",
    "She sat there smoking not\nlooking at me.",
    "For a moment or two I was nervous that she might not\nunderstand.",
    "Listen I said.",
    "The one thing Im determined not to do is to ask you\nto marry me now.",
    "That wouldnt work out anyway.",
    "First you might turn\nme down and then Id go off miserable and probably tie up with some\nghastly woman just to restore my vanity.",
    "And if you didnt turn me\ndown what could we do about it Get married and part at once Get\nengaged and settle down to a long waiting period.",
    "I couldnt stand your\ndoing that.",
    "You might meet someone else and feel bound to be loyal to\nme.",
    "Weve been living in a queer hectic getonwithitquickly\natmosphere.",
    "Marriages and love affairs making and breaking all round\nus.",
    "Id like to feel youd gone home free and independent to look\nround you and size up the new postwar world and decide what you\nwant out of it.",
    "What is between you and me Sophia has got to be\npermanent.",
    "Ive no use for any other kind of marriage.",
    "No more have I said Sophia.",
    "On the other hand I said I think I Im entitled to let you know how I well  how I feel.",
    "But without undue lyrical expression murmured Sophia.",
    "Darling  dont you understand Ive tried not to say I love you \n\nShe stopped me.",
    "I do understand Charles.",
    "And I like your funny way of doing things.",
    "And you may come and see me when you come back  if you still want\nto \n\nIt was my turn to interrupt.",
    "Theres no doubt about that.",
    "Theres always a doubt about everything Charles.",
    "There may always\nbe some incalculable factor that upsets the apple cart.",
    "For one thing\nyou dont know much about me do you\n\nI dont even know where you live in England.",
    "I live at Swinly Dean.",
    "I nodded at the mention of the wellknown outer suburb of London\nwhich boasts three excellent golf courses for the city financier.",
    "She added softly in a musing voice In a little crooked house...",
    "I must have looked slightly startled for she seemed amused and\nexplained by elaborating the quotation And they all lived together in a\nlittle crooked house.",
    "Thats us.",
    "Not really such a little house either.",
    "But definitely crooked  running to gables and halftimbering\n\nAre you one of a large family Brothers and sisters\n\nOne brother one sister a mother a father an uncle an aunt by\nmarriage a grandfather a great aunt and a step grandmother.",
    "Good gracious I exclaimed slightly overwhelmed.",
    "She laughed.",
    "Of course we dont normally all live together.",
    "The war and blitzes\nhave brought that about  but I dont know  she frowned reflectively perhaps spiritually the family has always lived together  under my\ngrandfathers eye\n\nand\n\nprotection.",
    "Hes\n\nrather\n\na person\n\nmy\n\ngrandfather.",
    "Hes over eighty about four foot ten and everybody else\nlooks rather dim beside him.",
    "He sounds interesting I said.",
    "He is interesting.",
    "Hes a Greek from Smyrna.",
    "Aristide Leonides.",
    "She\nadded with a twinkle Hes extremely rich.",
    "Will anybody be rich after this is over\n\nMy grandfather will said Sophia with assurance.",
    "No soaktherich\ntactics would have any effect on him.",
    "Hed just soak the soakers.",
    "I wonder she added if youll like him\n\nDo you I asked.",
    "Better than anyone in the world said Sophia.",
    "Chapter 2\n\n\fIt was over two years before I returned to England.",
    "They were not easy\nyears.",
    "I wrote to Sophia and heard from her fairly frequently.",
    "Her\nletters like mine were not love letters.",
    "They were letters written to\neach other by close friends  they dealt with ideas and thoughts and\nwith comments on the daily trend of life.",
    "Yet I know that as far as I was\nconcerned and I believed as far as Sophia was concerned too our\nfeeling for each other grew and strengthened.",
    "I returned to England on a soft grey day in September.",
    "The leaves on\nthe trees were golden in the evening light.",
    "There were playful gusts of\nwind.",
    "From the airfield I sent a telegram to Sophia.",
    "Just arrived back.",
    "Will you dine this evening Marios nine oclock.",
    "Charles.",
    "A couple of hours later I was sitting reading the Times and scanning\nthe Births Marriages and Death column my eye was caught by the\nname Leonides\n\nOn Sept. 19th at Three Gables Swinly Dean Aristide Leonides\nbeloved husband of Brenda Leonides in his eightyfifth year.",
    "Deeply\nregretted.",
    "There was another announcement immediately below\n\nLeonides.",
    "Suddenly at his residence Three Gables Swinly Dean\nAristide Leonides.",
    "Deeply mourned by his loving children and\ngrandchildren.",
    "Flowers to St Eldreds Church Swinly Dean.",
    "I found the two announcements rather curious.",
    "There seemed to have\nbeen some faulty staff work resulting in overlapping.",
    "But my main preoccupation was Sophia.",
    "I hastily sent her a second\ntelegram\n\nJust seen news of your grandfathers death.",
    "Very sorry.",
    "Let me know\nwhen I can see you.",
    "Charles.",
    "A telegram from Sophia reached me at six oclock at my fathers\nhouse.",
    "It said\n\nWill be at Marios nine oclock.",
    "Sophia.",
    "The thought of meeting Sophia again made me both nervous and\nexcited.",
    "The time crept by with maddening slowness.",
    "I was at Marios\nwaiting twenty minutes too early.",
    "Sophia herself was only five minutes\nlate.",
    "It is always a shock to meet again someone whom you have not seen\nfor a long time but who has been very much present in your mind\nduring that period.",
    "When at last Sophia came through the swing doors\nour meeting seemed completely unreal.",
    "She was wearing black and\nthat in some curious way startled me Most other women were\nwearing black but I got it into my head that it was definitely mourning and it surprised me that Sophia should be the kind of person who did\nwear black  even for a near relative.",
    "We had cocktails  then went and found our table.",
    "We talked rather fast\nand feverishly  asking after old friends of the Cairo days.",
    "It was\nartificial conversation but it tided us over the first awkwardness.",
    "I expressed commiseration for her grandfathers death and Sophia\nsaid quietly that it had been very sudden.",
    "Then we started off again\nreminiscing.",
    "I began to feel uneasily that something was the matter something I mean other than the first natural awkwardnesses of\nmeeting again.",
    "There was something wrong definitely wrong with Sophia herself.",
    "Was she perhaps going to tell me that she had found some other man\nwhom she cared for more than she did for me That her feeling for me\nhad been all a mistake\n\nSomehow I didnt think it was that  I didnt know what it was.",
    "Meanwhile we continued our artificial talk.",
    "Then quite suddenly as the waiter placed coffee on the table and\nretired bowing everything swung into focus.",
    "Here were Sophia and I\nsitting together as so often before at a small table in a restaurant.",
    "The\nyears of our separation might never have been.",
    "Sophia I said.",
    "And immediately she said Charles\n\nI drew a deep breath of relief.",
    "Thank goodness thats over I said.",
    "Whats been the matter with\nus\n\nProbably my fault.",
    "I was stupid.",
    "But its all right now\n\nYes its all right now.",
    "We smiled at each other.",
    "Darling I said.",
    "And then How soon will you marry me\n\nHer smile died.",
    "The something whatever it was was back.",
    "I dont know she said.",
    "Im not sure Charles that I can ever marry\nyou.",
    "But Sophia Why not Is it because you feel Im a stranger Do you\nwant time to get used to me again Is there someone else No  I\nbroke off.",
    "Im a fool.",
    "Its none of those things.",
    "No it isnt.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "I waited.",
    "She said in a low voice\n\nIts my grandfathers death.",
    "Your grandfathers death But why What earthly difference can that\nmake You dont mean  surely you cant imagine  is it money Hasnt\nhe left any But surely dearest \n\n\fIt isnt money.",
    "She gave a fleeting smile.",
    "I think youd be quite\nwilling to take me in my shift as the old saying goes.",
    "And grandfather\nnever lost any money in his life.",
    "Then what is it\n\nIts just his death  you see I think Charles that he didnt just  die.",
    "I\nthink he may have been  killed...",
    "I stared at her.",
    "But  what a fantastic idea.",
    "What made you think of it\n\nI didnt think of it.",
    "The doctor was queer to begin with.",
    "He wouldnt\nsign a certificate.",
    "Theyre going to have a post mortem.",
    "Its quite clear\nthat they suspect something is wrong.",
    "I didnt dispute that with her.",
    "Sophia had plenty of brains any\nconclusions she had drawn could be relied upon.",
    "Instead I said earnestly Their suspicions may be quite unjustified.",
    "But\nputting that aside supposing that they are justified how does that\naffect you and me\n\nIt might under certain circumstances.",
    "Youre in the Diplomatic\nService.",
    "Theyre rather particular about wives.",
    "No  please dont say all\nthe things that youre just bursting to say.",
    "Youre bound to say them and I believe you really think them  and theoretically I quite agree with\nthem.",
    "But Im proud  Im devilishly proud.",
    "I want our marriage to be a\n\n\fgood thing for everyone  I dont want to represent one half of a\nsacrifice for love And as I say it may be all right...\n\nYou mean the doctor  may have made a mistake\n\nEven if he hasnt made a mistake it wont matter  so long as the right\nperson killed him.",
    "What do you mean Sophia\n\nIt was a beastly thing to say.",
    "But after all one might as well be\nhonest.",
    "She forestalled my next words.",
    "No Charles Im not going to say any more.",
    "Ive probably said too\nmuch already.",
    "But I was determined to come and meet you tonight  to\nsee you myself and make you understand.",
    "We cant settle anything\nuntil this is cleared up.",
    "At least tell me about it.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "I dont want to.",
    "But  Sophia \n\nNo Charles.",
    "I dont want you to see us from my angle.",
    "I want you to\nsee us unbiased from the outside point of view.",
    "And how am I to do that\n\nShe looked at me a queer light in her brilliant blue eyes.",
    "Youll get that from your father she said.",
    "I had told Sophia in Cairo that my father was Assistant Commissioner\nof Scotland Yard.",
    "He still held that office.",
    "At her words I felt a cold\nweight settling down on me.",
    "Its as bad as that then\n\nI think so.",
    "Do you see a man sitting at a table by the door all alone rather a nicelooking stolid exArmy type\n\nYes.",
    "He was on Swinly Dean platform this evening when I got into the\ntrain.",
    "You mean hes followed you here\n\nYes.",
    "I think were all  how does one put it  under observation.",
    "They\nmore or less hinted that wed all better not leave the house.",
    "But I was\ndetermined to see you.",
    "Her small square chin shot out pugnaciously.",
    "I got out of the bathroom window and shinned down the water pipe.",
    "Darling\n\nBut the police are very efficient.",
    "And of course there was the\ntelegram I sent you.",
    "Well  never mind  were here  together...",
    "But\nfrom now on weve both got to play a lone hand.",
    "She paused and then added Unfortunately  theres no doubt  about\nour loving each other.",
    "No doubt at all I said.",
    "And dont say unfortunately.",
    "You and I have\nsurvived a world war weve had plenty of near escapes from sudden\ndeath  and I dont see why the sudden death of just one old man  how\nold was he by the way\n\nEighty five.",
    "Of course.",
    "It was in the Times.",
    "If you ask me he just died of old age\nand any selfrespecting G.P.",
    "would accept the fact.",
    "If youd known my grandfather said Sophia youd have been\nsurprised at his dying of anything\n\nChapter 3\n\nId always taken a certain amount of interest in my fathers police\nwork but nothing had prepared me for the moment when I should\ncome to take a direct and personal interest in it.",
    "I had not yet seen the Old Man.",
    "He had been out when I arrived and\nafter a bath a shave and a change I had gone out to meet Sophia.",
    "When I returned to the house however Glover told me that he was in\nhis study.",
    "He was at his desk frowning over a lot of papers.",
    "He jumped up when I\ncame in.",
    "Charles Well well its been a long time.",
    "Our meeting after five years of war would have disappointed a\nFrenchman.",
    "Actually all the emotion of reunion was there all right.",
    "The Old Man and\nI are very fond of each other and we understand each other pretty\nwell.",
    "Ive got some whisky he said.",
    "Say when.",
    "Sorry I was out when you\ngot here.",
    "Im up to the ears in work.",
    "Hell of a case just unfolding.",
    "I leaned back in my chair and lit a cigarette.",
    "Aristide Leonides I asked.",
    "His brows came down quickly over his eyes.",
    "He shot me a quick\nappraising glance.",
    "His voice was polite and steely.",
    "Now what makes you say that Charles\n\n\fIm right then\n\nHow did you know about this\n\nInformation received.",
    "The Old Man waited.",
    "My information I said came from the stable itself.",
    "Come on Charles lets have it.",
    "You maynt like it I said.",
    "I met Sophia Leonides out in Cairo.",
    "I fell in\nlove with her.",
    "Im going to marry her.",
    "I met her tonight.",
    "She dined with\nme.",
    "Dined with you In London I wonder just how she managed to do\nthat The family were asked  oh quite politely to stay put.",
    "Quite so.",
    "She shinned down a pipe from the bathroom window.",
    "The Old Mans lips twitched for a moment into a smile.",
    "She seems he said to be a young lady of some resource.",
    "But your police force is fully efficient I said.",
    "A nice Army type\ntracked her to Marios.",
    "I shall figure in the reports you get.",
    "Five foot\neleven brown hair brown eyes dark blue pinstripe suit etc.",
    "The Old Man looked at me hard.",
    "Is this  serious he asked.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "Its serious dad.",
    "There was a moments silence.",
    "Do you mind I asked.",
    "I shouldnt have minded  a week ago.",
    "Theyre a well established\nfamily  the girl will have money  and I know you.",
    "You dont lose your\nhead easily.",
    "As it is \n\nYes dad\n\nIt may be all right if \n\nIf what\n\nIf the right person did it.",
    "It was the second time that night I had heard that phrase.",
    "I began to be\ninterested.",
    "Just who is the right person\n\nHe threw a sharp glance at me.",
    "How much do you know about it all\n\n\fNothing.",
    "Nothing He looked surprised.",
    "Didnt the girl tell you\n\nNo... She said shed rather I saw it all  from an outside point of view.",
    "Now I wonder why that was\n\nIsnt it rather obvious\n\nNo Charles.",
    "I dont think it is.",
    "He walked up and down frowning.",
    "He had lit a cigar and the cigar had\ngone out.",
    "That showed me just how disturbed the old boy was.",
    "How much do you know about the family he shot at me.",
    "Damn all I know there was the old man and a lot of sons and\ngrandchildren and inlaws.",
    "I havent got the ramifications clear.",
    "I paused and then said Youd better put me in the picture dad.",
    "Yes.",
    "He sat down.",
    "Very well then  Ill begin at the beginning  with\nAristide Leonides.",
    "He arrived in England when he was twentyfour.",
    "A Greek from Smyrna.",
    "You do know that much\n\nYes but its about all I do know.",
    "The door opened and Glover came in to say that Chief Inspector\nTaverner was here.",
    "Hes in charge of the case said my father.",
    "Wed better have him in.",
    "Hes been checking up on the family.",
    "Knows more about them than I\ndo.",
    "I asked if the local police had called in the Yard.",
    "Its in our jurisdiction.",
    "Swinly Dean is Greater London.",
    "I nodded as Chief Inspector Taverner came into the room.",
    "I knew\nTaverner from many years back.",
    "He greeted me warmly and\ncongratulated me on my safe return.",
    "Im putting Charles in the picture said the Old Man.",
    "Correct me if I\ngo wrong Taverner.",
    "Leonides came to London in 1884.",
    "He started up\na little restaurant in Soho.",
    "It paid.",
    "He started up another.",
    "Soon he\nowned seven or eight of them.",
    "They all paid hand over fist.",
    "Never made any mistakes in anything he handled said Chief\nInspector Taverner.",
    "Hed got a natural flair said my father.",
    "In the end he was behind\nmost of the well known restaurants in London.",
    "Then he went into the\ncatering business in a big way.",
    "He was behind a lot of other businesses as well said Taverner.",
    "Second hand clothes trade cheap jewellery stores lots of things.",
    "Of\ncourse he added thoughtfully.",
    "He was always a twister.",
    "You mean he was a crook I asked.",
    "Taverner shook his head.",
    "No I dont mean that.",
    "Crooked yes  but not a crook.",
    "Never anything\noutside the law.",
    "But he was the sort of chap that thought up all the\nways you can get round the law.",
    "Hes cleaned up a packet that way\neven in this last war and old as he was.",
    "Nothing he did was ever illegal\n but as soon as hed got on to it you had to have a law about it if you\nknow what I mean.",
    "But by that time hed gone on to the next thing.",
    "He doesnt sound a very attractive character I said.",
    "Funnily enough he was attractive.",
    "Hed got personality you know.",
    "You could feel it.",
    "Nothing much to look at.",
    "Just a gnome  ugly little\nfellow  but magnetic  women always fell for him.",
    "He made a rather astonishing marriage said my father.",
    "Married the\ndaughter of a country squire  an M.F.H.",
    "I raised my eyebrows.",
    "Money\n\nThe Old Man shook his head.",
    "No it was a love match.",
    "She met him over some catering\narrangements for a friends wedding  and she fell for him.",
    "Her parents\n\n\fcut up rough but she was determined to have him.",
    "I tell you the man\nhad charm  there was something exotic and dynamic about him that\nappealed to her.",
    "She was bored stiff with her own kind.",
    "And the marriage was happy\n\nIt was very happy oddly enough.",
    "Of course their respective friends\ndidnt mix those were the days before money swept aside all class\ndistinctions but that didnt seem to worry them.",
    "They did without\nfriends.",
    "He built a rather preposterous house at Swinly Dean and they\nlived there and had eight children.",
    "This is indeed a family chronicle.",
    "Old Leonides was rather clever to choose Swinly Dean.",
    "It was only\nbeginning to be fashionable then.",
    "The second and third golf courses\nhadnt been made.",
    "There was a mixture there of Old Inhabitants who\nwere passionately fond of their gardens and who liked Mrs Leonides\nand rich City men who wanted to be in with Leonides so they could\ntake their choice of acquaintances.",
    "They were perfectly happy I\nbelieve until she died of pneumonia in 1905.",

    "And theres an elderly aunt.",
    "Miss de Haviland sister of the first Mrs Leonides.",
    "She always loathed\nher brotherinlaw apparently but when her sister died she considered\nit her duty I to accept her brotherinlaws invitation to live with him and\nbring up the children.",
    "Shes very hot on duty said Inspector Taverner.",
    "But shes not the\nkind that changes her mind about people.",
    "She always disapproved of\nLeonides and his methods \n\nWell I said it seems a pretty good house full.",
    "Who do you think\nkilled him Taverner shook his head.",
    "Early days he said early days to say that.",
    "Come on Taverner I said.",
    "I bet you think you know who did it.",
    "Were not in court man.",
    "No said Taverner gloomily.",
    "And we never may be.",
    "You mean he may not have been murdered\n\nOh he was murdered all right.",
    "Poisoned.",
    "But you know what these\npoisoning cases are like.",
    "Its very tricky getting the evidence.",
    "Very\ntricky.",
    "All the possibilities may point one way \n\n\fThats what Im trying to get at.",
    "Youve got it all taped out in your mind\nhavent you\n\nIts a case of very strong probability.",
    "Its one of those obvious things.",
    "The perfect setup.",
    "But I dont know Im sure.",
    "Its tricky.",
    "I looked appealingly at the Old Man.",
    "He said slowly\n\nIn murder cases as you know Charles the obvious is usually the\nright solution.",
    "Old Leonides married again ten years ago.",
    "When he was seventyfive\n\nYes he married a young woman of twentyfour.",
    "I whistled.",
    "What sort of a young woman\n\nA young woman out of a tea shop.",
    "A perfectly respectable young\nwoman  good looking in an anaemic apathetic sort of way.",
    "And shes the strong probability\n\nI ask you sir said Taverner.",
    "Shes only thirtyfour now  and thats a\ndangerous age.",
    "She likes living soft.",
    "And theres a young man in the\nhouse.",
    "Tutor to the grandchildren.",
    "Not been in the war  got a bad\nheart or something.",
    "Theyre as thick as thieves.",
    "I looked at him thoughtfully.",
    "It was certainly an old and familiar\npattern.",
    "The mixture as before.",
    "And the second Mrs Leonides was my\nfather had emphasized very respectable.",
    "In the name of respectability\nmany murders have been committed.",
    "What was it I asked.",
    "Arsenic\n\nNo.",

    "His wife.",
    "I understood now what Sophia had meant by the right person.",
    "I asked Does the family get on well with the second Mrs Leonides\n\nNo.",
    "I gather they are hardly on speaking terms.",
    "It all seemed clearer and clearer.",
    "Nevertheless Inspector Taverner\nwas clearly not happy about it.",
    "What dont you like about it I asked him.",
    "If she did it Mr Charles it would have been so easy for her to\nsubstitute a bona fide bottle of insulin afterwards.",
    "In fact if she is\nguilty I cant imagine why on earth she didnt do just that.",
    "Yes it does seem indicated.",
    "Plenty of insulin about\n\nOh yes full bottles and empty ones.",
    "And if shed done that ten to one\nthe doctor wouldnt have spotted it.",
    "Very little is known of the post\nmortem appearances in human poisoning by eserine.",
    "But as it was he\nchecked up on the insulin in case it was the wrong strength or\nsomething like that and so of course he soon spotted that it wasnt\ninsulin.",
    "So it seems I said thoughtfully that Mrs Leonides was either very\nstupid  or possibly very clever.",
    "You mean \n\n\fThat she may be gambling on your coming to the conclusion that\nnobody could have been as stupid as she appears to have been.",
    "What\nare the alternatives Any other  suspects\n\nThe Old Man said quietly\n\nPractically anyone in the house could have done it.",
    "There was always\na good store of insulin  at least a fortnights supply.",
    "One of the phials\ncould have been tampered with and replaced in the knowledge that it\nwould be used in due course.",
    "And anybody more or less had access to them\n\nThey werent locked away.",
    "They were kept on a special shelf in the\nmedicine cupboard in the bathroom of his part of the house.",
    "Everybody in the house came and went freely.",
    "Any strong motive My father sighed.",
    "My dear Charles Aristide\nLeonides was enormously rich He had made over a good deal of his\nmoney to his family it is true but it may be that somebody wanted\nmore.",
    "But the one that wanted it most would be the present widow.",
    "Has her\nyoung man any money\n\nNo.",
    "Poor as a Church mouse.",
    "Something clicked in my brain.",
    "I remembered Sophias quotation.",
    "I\nsuddenly remembered the whole verse of the nursery rhyme\n\n\fThere was a crooked man and he went a crooked mile\n\nHe found a crooked sixpence beside a crooked stile\n\nHe had a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse\n\nAnd they all lived together in a little crooked house.",
    "I said to Taverner\n\nHow does she strike you  Mrs Leonides What do you think of her\n\nHe replied slowly\n\nIts hard to say  very hard to say.",
    "Shes not easy.",
    "Very quiet  so you\ndont know what shes thinking.",
    "But she likes living soft  that Ill swear\nIm right about.",
    "Puts me in mind you know of a cat a big purring lazy\ncat... Not that Ive anything against cats.",
    "Cats are all right...",
    "He sighed.",
    "What we want he said is evidence.",
    "Yes I thought we all wanted evidence that Mrs Leonides had poisoned\nher husband.",
    "Sophia wanted it and I wanted it and Chief Inspector\nTaverner wanted it.",
    "Then everything in the garden would be lovely\n\n\fBut Sophia wasnt sure and I wasnt sure and I didnt think Chief\nInspector Taverner was sure either...\n\nChapter 4\n\nOn the following day I went down to Three Gables with Taverner.",
    "My position was a curious one.",
    "It was to say the least of it quite\nunorthodox.",
    "But the Old Man has never been highly orthodox.",
    "I had a certain standing.",
    "I had worked with the Special Branch at the\nYard during the early days of the war.",
    "This of course was entirely different  but my earlier performances\nhad given me so to speak a certain official standing.",
    "My father said\n\nIf were ever going to solve this case weve got to get some inside\ndope.",
    "Weve got to know all about the people in that house.",
    "Weve got\nto know them from the inside  not the outside.",
    "Youre the man who can\nget that for us.",
    "I didnt like it.",
    "I threw my cigarette end into the grate as I said\n\nI  Im a police spy Is that it Im to get the inside dope from Sophia\nwhom I love and who both loves and trusts me or so I believe.",
    "The Old Man became quite irritable.",
    "He said sharply\n\nFor Heavens Sake dont take the commonplace view.",
    "To begin with\nyou dont believe do you that your young woman murdered her\ngrandfather\n\nOf course not.",
    "The ideas absolutely absurd.",
    "Very well  we dont think so either.",
    "Shes been away for some years\nshe has always been on perfectly amicable terms with him.",
    "She has a\nvery generous income and he would have been I should say delighted\nto hear of her engagement to you and would probably have made a\nhandsome marriage settlement on her.",
    "We dont suspect her.",
    "Why\nshould we But you can make quite sure of one thing.",
    "If this thing isnt\ncleared up that girl wont marry you.",
    "From what youve told me Im\nfairly sure of that.",
    "And mark this its the kind of crime that may never\nbe cleared up.",
    "We may be reasonably sure that the wife and her young\nman were in cahoots over it  but proving it will be another matter.",
    "Theres not even a case to put up to the D.P.P.",
    "so far.",
    "And unless we\nget definite evidence against her therell always be a nasty doubt.",
    "You\nsee that dont you\n\nYes I saw that.",
    "The Old Man then said quietly\n\nWhy not put it to her\n\nYou mean  ask Sophia if I  I stopped.",
    "The Old Man was nodding his head vigorously.",
    "Yes yes... Im not asking you to worm your way in without telling the\ngirl what youre up to.",
    "See what she has to say about it.",
    "And so it came about that the following day I drove down with Chief\nInspector Taverner and Detective Sergeant Lamb to Swinly Dean.",
    "A little way beyond the golf course we turned in at a gateway where I\nimagined that before the war there had been an imposing pair of\ngates.",
    "Patriotism or ruthless requisitioning had swept these away.",
    "We\ndrove up a long curving drive flanked with rhododendrons and came\nout on a gravelled sweep in front of the house.",
    "It was incredible I wondered why it had been called Three Gables.",
    "Eleven Gables would have been more apposite The curious thing was\nthat it had a strange air of being distorted  and I thought I knew why.",
    "It\nwas the type really of a cottage it was a cottage swollen out of all\nproportion.",
    "It was like looking at a country cottage through a gigantic\nmagnifying glass.",
    "The slantwise beams the halftimbering the gables it was a little crooked house that had grown like a mushroom in the\nnight\n\nYet I got the idea.",
    "It was a Greek restauranteers idea of something\nEnglish.",
    "It was meant to be an Englishmans home  built the size of a castle I\nwondered what the first Mrs Leonides had thought of it.",
    "She had not I\nfancied been consulted or shown the plans.",
    "It was most probably her\n\n\fexotic husbands little surprise.",
    "I wondered if she had shuddered or\nsmiled.",
    "Apparently she had lived there quite happily.",
    "Bit overwhelming isnt it said Inspector Taverner.",
    "Of course the\nold gentleman built on to it a good deal  making it into three separate\nhouses so to speak with kitchens and everything.",
    "Its all tip top inside\nfitted up like a luxury hotel.",
    "Sophia came out of the front door.",
    "She was hatless and wore a green\nshirt and a tweed skirt.",
    "She stopped dead when she saw me.",
    "You she exclaimed.",
    "I said Sophia Ive got to talk to you.",
    "Where can we go\n\nFor a moment I thought she was going to demur then she turned and\nsaid This way.",
    "We walked down across the lawn.",
    "There was a fine view across Swinly\nDeans No 1 course  away to a clump of pine trees on a hill and\nbeyond it to the dimness of hazy countryside.",
    "Sophia led me to a rockgarden now somewhat neglected where\nthere was a rustic wooden seat of great discomfort and we sat down.",
    "Well she said.",
    "Her voice was not encouraging.",
    "I said my piece  all of it.",
    "She listened very attentively.",
    "Her face gave\nlittle indication of what she was thinking but when I came at last to a\nfull stop she sighed.",
    "It was a deep sigh.",
    "Your father she said is a very clever man.",
    "The Old Man has his points.",
    "I think its a rotten idea myself  but \n\nShe interrupted me.",
    "Oh no she said.",
    "It isnt a rotten idea at all.",
    "Its the only thing that\nmight be any good.",
    "Your father Charles knows exactly whats been\ngoing on in my mind.",
    "He knows better than you do.",
    "With sudden almost despairing vehemence she drove one clenched\nhand into the palm of the other.",
    "Ive got to have the truth.",
    "Ive got to know.",
    "Because of us But dearest \n\nNot only because of us Charles.",
    "Ive got to know for my own peace of\nmind.",
    "You see Charles I didnt tell you last night  but the truth is  Im\nafraid.",
    "Afraid\n\n\fYes  afraid  afraid  afraid.",
    "The police think your father thinks\neverybody thinks  that it was Brenda.",
    "The probabilities \n\nOh yes its quite probable.",
    "Its possible.",
    "But when I say Brenda\nprobably did it  Im quite conscious that its only wishful thinking.",
    "Because you see I dont really think so.",
    "You dont think so I said slowly.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Youve heard about it all from the outside as I wanted\nyou to.",
    "Now Ill show it to you from the inside.",
    "I simply dont feel that\nBrenda is that kind of a person  shes not the sort of person I feel\nwho would ever do anything that might involve her in any danger.",
    "Shes far too careful of herself.",
    "How about this young man Laurence Brown.",
    "Laurence is a complete rabbit.",
    "He wouldnt have the guts.",
    "I wonder.",
    "Yes we dont really know do we I mean people are capable of\nsurprising one frightfully.",
    "One gets an idea of them into ones head\nand sometimes its absolutely wrong.",
    "Not always  but sometimes.",
    "But\nall the same Brenda  she shook her head  shes always acted so\ncompletely in character.",
    "Shes what I call the harem type.",
    "Likes sitting\nabout and eating sweets and having nice clothes and jewellery and\nreading cheap novels and going to the cinema.",
    "And its a queer thing\n\n\fto say when one remembers that he was eightyfive but I really think\nshe was rather thrilled by grandfather.",
    "He had a power you know.",
    "I\nshould imagine he could make a woman feel  oh  rather like a queen the Sultans favourite I think  Ive always thought  that he made\nBrenda feel as though she were an exciting romantic person.",
    "Hes\nbeen clever with women all his life  and that kind of thing is a sort of\nart  you dont lose the knack of it however old you are.",
    "I left the problem of Brenda for the moment and harked back to a\nphrase of Sophias which had disturbed me.",
    "Why did you say I asked that you were afraid\n\nSophia shivered a little and pressed her hands together.",
    "Because its true she said in a low voice.",
    "Its very important\nCharles that I should make you understand this.",
    "You see were a very\nqueer family... Theres a lot of ruthlessness in us  and  different kinds\nof ruthlessness.",
    "Thats whats so disturbing.",
    "The different kinds.",
    "She must have seen incomprehension in my face.",
    "She went on\nspeaking energetically.",
    "Ill try and make what I mean clear.",
    "Grandfather for instance.",
    "Once\nwhen he was telling us about his boyhood in Smyrna he mentioned\nquite casually that he had stabbed two men.",
    "It was some kind of a\nbrawl  there had been some unforgivable insult  I dont know  but it\nwas just a thing that had happened quite naturally.",
    "Hed really\npractically forgotten about it.",
    "But it was somehow such a queer thing\nto hear about quite casually in England.",
    "I nodded.",
    "Thats one kind of ruthlessness went on Sophia and then there was\nmy grandmother.",
    "I only just remember her but Ive heard a good deal\nabout her.",
    "I think she might have had the ruthlessness that comes from\nhaving no imagination whatever.",
    "All those foxhunting forbears  and\nthe old Generals the shoot em down type.",
    "Full of rectitude and\narrogance and not a bit afraid of taking responsibility in matters of life\nand death.",
    "Isnt that a bit far fetched\n\nYes I daresay  but Im always rather afraid of that type.",
    "Its full of\nrectitude but it is ruthless.",
    "And then theres my own mother  shes an\nactress  shes a darling but shes got absolutely no sense of\nproportion.",
    "Shes one of those unconscious egoists who can only see\nthings in relation as to how it affects them.",
    "Thats rather frightening\nsometimes you know.",
    "And theres Clemency Uncle Rogers wife.",
    "Shes a scientist  shes doing some kind of very important research shes ruthless too in a kind of coldblooded impersonal way.",
    "Uncle\nRogers the exact opposite  hes the kindest and most lovable person\nin the world but hes got a really terrific temper.",
    "Things make his\nblood boil and then he hardly knows what hes doing.",
    "And theres\nfather \n\nShe made a long pause.",
    "Father she said slowly is almost too well controlled.",
    "You never\nknow what hes thinking.",
    "He never shows any emotion at all.",
    "Its\n\n\fprobably a kind of unconscious self defence against mothers absolute\norgies of emotion but sometimes  it worries me a little.",
    "My dear child I said youre working yourself up unnecessarily.",
    "What it comes to in the end is that everybody perhaps is capable of\nmurder.",
    "I suppose thats true.",
    "Even me.",
    "Not you\n\nOh yes Charles you cant make me an exception.",
    "I suppose I could\nmurder someone... She was silent a moment or two then added But\nif so it would have to be for something really worth while\n\nI laughed then.",
    "I couldnt help it.",
    "And Sophia smiled.",
    "Perhaps Im a fool she said but weve got to find out the truth about\ngrandfathers death.",
    "Weve got to.",
    "If only it was Brenda...",
    "I felt suddenly rather sorry for Brenda Leonides.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nAlong the path towards us came a tall figure walking briskly.",
    "It had on\na battered old felt hat a shapeless skirt and a rather cumbersome\njersey.",
    "Aunt Edith said Sophia.",
    "The figure paused once or twice stooping to the flower borders then\nit advanced upon us.",
    "I rose to my feet.",
    "This is Charles Hayward Aunt Edith.",
    "My aunt Miss de Haviland.",
    "Edith de Haviland was a woman of about seventy.",
    "She had a mass of\nuntidy grey hair a weather beaten face and a shrewd and piercing\nglance.",
    "How dye do she said.",
    "Ive heard about you.",
    "Back from the East.",
    "Hows your father\n\nRather surprised I said he was very well.",
    "Knew him when he was a boy said Miss de Haviland.",
    "Knew his\nmother very well.",
    "You look rather like her.",
    "Have you come to help us or the other thing\n\nI hope to help I said rather uncomfortably.",
    "She nodded.",
    "We could do with some help.",
    "Place swarming with policemen.",
    "Pop out\nat you all over the place.",
    "Dont like some of the types.",
    "A boy whos\nbeen to a decent school oughtnt to go into the police.",
    "Saw Moyra\nKinouls boy the other day holding up the traffic at Marble Arch.",
    "Makes\nyou feel you dont know where you are\n\n\fShe turned to Sophia Nannies asking for you Sophia.",
    "Fish.",
    "Bother said Sophia.",
    "Ill go and telephone about it.",
    "She walked briskly towards the house.",
    "Miss de Haviland turned and walked slowly in the same direction.",
    "I fell\ninto step beside her.",
    "Dont know what wed all do without Nannies said Miss de Haviland.",
    "Nearly everybodys got an old Nannie.",
    "They come back and wash and\niron and cook and do housework.",
    "Faithful.",
    "Chose this one myself years ago.",
    "She stooped and pulled viciously at an entangling twining bit of green.",
    "Hateful stuff  bindweed Worst weed there is Choking entangling and you cant get at it properly runs along underground.",
    "With her heel she ground the handful of green stuff viciously\nunderfoot.",
    "This is a bad business Charles Hayward she said.",
    "She was looking\ntowards the house.",
    "What do the police think about it Suppose I\nmustnt ask you that.",
    "Seems odd to think of Aristide being poisoned.",
    "For that matter it seems odd to think of him being dead.",
    "I never liked\nhim  never But I cant get used to the idea of his being dead... Makes\nthe house seem so  empty.",
    "I said nothing.",
    "For all her curt way of speech Edith de Haviland\nseemed in a reminiscent mood.",
    "Was thinking this morning  Ive lived here a long time.",
    "Over forty\nyears.",
    "Came here when my sister died.",
    "He asked me to.",
    "Seven\nchildren  and the youngest only a year old... Couldnt leave em to be\nbrought up by a dago could I An impossible marriage of course.",
    "I\nalways felt Marcia must have been  well  bewitched.",
    "Ugly common\nlittle foreigner He gave me a free hand  I will say that.",
    "Nurses\ngovernesses schools.",
    "And proper wholesome nursery food  not those\nqueer spiced rice dishes he used to eat.",
    "And youve been here ever since I murmured.",
    "Yes.",
    "Queer in a way...",
    "I could have left I suppose when the children\ngrew up and married...",
    "I suppose really Id got interested in the\ngarden.",
    "And then there was Philip.",
    "If a man marries an actress he cant\nexpect to have any home life.",
    "Dont know why actresses have children.",
    "As soon as a babys born they rush off and play in Repertory in\nEdinburgh or somewhere as remote as possible.",
    "Philip did the sensible\nthing  moved in here with his books.",
    "What does Philip Leonides do\n\nWrites books.",
    "Cant think why.",
    "Nobody wants to read them.",
    "All about\nobscure historical details.",
    "Youve never even heard of them have\nyou\n\nI admitted it.",
    "Too much money thats what hes had said Miss de Haviland.",
    "Most\npeople have to stop being cranks and earn a living.",
    "Dont his books pay\n\nOf course not.",
    "Hes supposed to be a great authority on certain\nperiods and all that.",
    "But he doesnt have to make his books pay Aristide settled something like a hundred thousand pounds something quite fantastic  on him To avoid death duties Aristide\nmade them all financially independent.",
    "Roger runs Associated\nCatering  Sophia has a very handsome allowance.",
    "The childrens\nmoney is in trust for them.",
    "So no one gains particularly by his death\n\nShe threw me a strange glance.",
    "Yes they do.",
    "They all get more money.",
    "But they could probably have\nhad it if they asked for it anyway.",
    "Have you any idea who poisoned him Miss de Haviland\n\nShe replied characteristically\n\nNo indeed I havent.",
    "Its upset me very much Not nice to think one\nhas a Borgia sort of person loose about the house.",
    "I suppose the police\nwill fasten on poor Brenda.",
    "You dont think theyll be right in doing so\n\nI simply cant tell.",
    "Shes always seemed to me a singularly stupid and\ncommonplace young woman  rather conventional.",
    "Not my idea of a\n\n\fpoisoner.",
    "Still after all if a young woman of twentyfour marries a man\nclose on eighty its fairly obvious that shes marrying him for his\nmoney.",
    "In the normal course of events she could have expected to\nbecome a rich widow fairly soon.",
    "But Aristide was a singularly tough\nold man.",
    "His diabetes wasnt getting any worse.",
    "He really looked like\nliving to be a hundred.",
    "I suppose she got tired of waiting...",
    "In that case I said and stopped.",
    "In that case said Miss de Haviland briskly it will be more or less all\nright.",
    "Annoying publicity of course.",
    "But after all she isnt one of the\nfamily.",
    "Youve no other ideas I asked.",
    "What other ideas should I have\n\nI wondered.",
    "I had a suspicion that there might be more going on under\nthe battered felt hat than I knew.",
    "Behind the jerky almost disconnected utterance there was I thought\na very shrewd brain at work.",
    "Just for a moment I even wondered\nwhether Miss de Haviland had poisoned Aristide Leonides herself...",
    "It did not seem an impossible idea.",
    "At the back of my mind was the way\nshe had ground the bindweed into the soil with her heel with a kind of\nvindictive thoroughness.",
    "I remembered the word Sophia had used.",
    "Ruthlessness.",
    "I stole a sideways glance at Edith de Haviland.",
    "Given good and sufficient reason...",
    "But what exactly would seem to Edith de Haviland good and sufficient\nreason\n\nTo answer that I should have to know her better.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nThe front door was open.",
    "We passed through it into a rather\nsurprisingly spacious hall.",
    "It was furnished with restraint  wellpolished dark oak and gleaming brass.",
    "At the back where the\nstaircase would normally appear was a white panelled wall with a\ndoor in it.",
    "My brotherinlaws part of the house said Miss de Haviland.",
    "The\nground floor is Philip and Magdas.",
    "We went through a doorway on the left into a large drawing room.",
    "It\nhad pale blue panelled walls furniture covered in heavy brocade and\non every available table and on the walls were hung photographs and\npictures of actors dancers and stage scenes and designs.",
    "A Degas of\nballet dancers hung over the mantelpiece.",
    "There were masses of\nflowers enormous brown chrysanthemums and great vases of\ncarnations.",
    "I suppose said Miss de Haviland that you want to see Philip\n\nDid I want to see Philip I had no idea.",
    "All I had wanted to do was to\nsee Sophia.",
    "That I had done.",
    "She had given emphatic encouragement\nto the Old Mans plan  but she had now receded from the scene and\nwas presumably somewhere telephoning about fish having given me\nno indication of how to proceed.",
    "Was I to approach Philip Leonides as\na young man anxious to marry his daughter or as a casual friend who\nhad dropped in surely not at such a moment or as an associate of\nthe police Miss de Haviland gave me no time to consider her question.",
    "It was indeed not a question at all but more an assertion.",
    "Miss de Haviland I judged was more inclined to assert than to\nquestion.",
    "Well go to the library she said.",
    "She led me out of the drawing room along a corridor and in through\nanother door.",
    "It was a big room full of books.",
    "The books did not confine themselves\nto the bookcases that reached up to the ceiling.",
    "They were on chairs\nand tables and even on the floor.",
    "And yet there was no sense of\ndisarray about them.",
    "The room was cold.",
    "There was some smell absent in it that I was\nconscious of having expected.",
    "It smelt of the mustiness of old books\nand just a little of beeswax.",
    "In a second or two I realised what I missed.",
    "It was the scent of tobacco.",
    "Philip Leonides was not a smoker.",
    "He got up from behind his table as we entered  a tall man aged\nsomewhere around fifty an extraordinarily handsome man.",
    "Everyone\nhad laid so much emphasis on the ugliness of Aristide Leonides that\nfor some reason I expected his son to be ugly too.",
    "Certainly I was not\nprepared for this perfection of feature  the straight nose the flawless\nline of jaw the fair hair touched with grey that swept back from a well\nshaped forehead.",
    "This is Charles Hayward Philip said Edith de Haviland.",
    "Ah how do you do\n\nI could not tell if he had ever heard of me.",
    "The hand he gave me was\ncold.",
    "His face was quite incurious.",
    "It made me rather nervous.",
    "He\nstood there patient and uninterested.",
    "Where are those awful policemen demanded Miss de Haviland.",
    "Have they been in here\n\nI believe Chief Inspector  he glanced down at a card on the desk\ner  Taverner is coming to talk to me presently.",
    "Where is he now\n\nIve no idea.",
    "Aunt Edith.",
    "Upstairs I suppose.",
    "With Brenda\n\nI really dont know.",
    "Looking at Philip Leonides it seemed quite impossible that a murder\ncould have been committed anywhere in his vicinity.",
    "Is Magda up yet\n\nI dont know.",
    "Shes not usually up before eleven.",
    "That sounds like her said Edith de Haviland.",
    "What sounded like Mrs Philip Leonides was a high voice talking very\nrapidly and approaching very fast.",
    "The door behind me burst open and\na woman came in.",
    "I dont know how she managed to give the\nimpression of its being three women rather than one who entered.",
    "She was smoking a cigarette in a long holder and was wearing a peach\nsatin negligee which she was holding up with one hand.",
    "A cascade of\nTitian hair rippled down her back.",
    "Her face had that almost shocking\nair of nudity that a womans has nowadays when it is not made up at\nall.",
    "Her eyes were blue and enormous and she was talking very rapidly\nin a husky rather attractive voice with a very clear enunciation.",
    "Darling I cant stand it  I simply cant stand it  just think of the\nnotices  it isnt in the papers yet but of course it will be  and I simply\ncant make up my mind what I ought to wear at the inquest  very very\nsubdued  not black though perhaps dark purple  and I simply\nhavent got a coupon left  Ive lost the address of that dreadful man\nwho sells them to me  you know the garage somewhere near\nShaftesbury Avenue  and if I went up there in the car the police would\nfollow me and they might ask the most awkward questions mightnt\nthey I mean what could one say How calm you are Philip How can\n\n\fyou be so calm Dont you realise we can leave this awful house now.",
    "Freedom  freedom Oh how unkind  the poor old Sweetie  of course\nwed never have left him while he was alive.",
    "He really did dote on us\ndidnt he  in spite of all the trouble that woman upstairs tried to make\nbetween us.",
    "Im quite sure that if we had gone away and left him to her\nhed have cut us right out of everything.",
    "Horrible creature After all\npoor old Sweetie Pie was just on ninety  all the family feeling in the\nworld couldnt have stood up against a dreadful woman who was on\nthe spot.",
    "You know Philip I really believe that this would be a\nwonderful opportunity to put on the Edith Thompson play.",
    "This murder\nwould give us a lot of advance publicity.",
    "Bildenstein said he could get\nthe Thespian  that dreary play in verse about miners is coming off any\nminute  Its a wonderful part  wonderful.",
    "I know they say I must\nalways play comedy because of my nose  but you know theres quite a\nlot of comedy to be got out of Edith Thompson  I dont think the author\nrealised that  comedy heightens the suspense.",
    "I know just how Id play\nit  commonplace silly makebelieve up to the last minute and then \n\nShe cast out an arm  the cigarette fell out of the holder onto the\npolished mahogany of Philips desk and began to burn it.",
    "Impassively he reached for it and dropped it into the waste paper\nbasket.",
    "And then whispered Magda Leonides her eyes suddenly widening\nher face stiffening just terror...",
    "The stark fear stayed on her face for about twenty seconds then her\nface relaxed crumpled a bewildered child was about to burst into\ntears.",
    "Suddenly all emotion was wiped away as though by a sponge and\nturning to me she asked in a businesslike tone\n\nDont you think that would be the way to play Edith Thompson\n\nI said I thought that would be exactly the way to play Edith Thompson.",
    "At the moment I could only remember very vaguely who Edith\nThompson was but I was anxious to start off well with Sophias\nmother.",
    "Rather like Brenda really wasnt she said Magda.",
    "Dyou know I\nnever thought of that.",
    "Its very interesting.",
    "Shall I point that out to the\nInspector\n\nThe man behind the desk frowned very slightly.",
    "Theres really no need Magda he said for you to see him at all.",
    "I\ncan tell him anything he wants to know.",
    "Not see him Her voice went up.",
    "But of course I must see him\nDarling darling youre so terribly unimaginative You dont realise the\nimportance of details.",
    "Hell want to know exactly how and when\neverything happened all the little things one noticed and wondered\nabout at the time \n\nMother said Sophia coming through the open door youre not to\ntell the Inspector a lot of lies.",
    "Sophia  darling...",
    "I know precious that youve got it all set and that youre ready to give\na most beautiful performance.",
    "But youve got it wrong.",
    "Quite wrong.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "You dont know \n\nI do know.",
    "Youve got to play it quite differently darling.",
    "Subdued saying very little  holding it all back  on your guard  protecting the\nfamily.",
    "Magda Leonides face showed the na\u00efve perplexity of a child.",
    "Darling she said do you really think \n\nYes I do.",
    "Throw it away.",
    "Thats the idea.",
    "Sophia added as a little pleased smile began to show on her mothers\nface\n\nIve made you some chocolate.",
    "Its in the drawing room.",
    "Oh  good  Im starving \n\nShe paused in the doorway.",
    "You dont know she said and the words appeared to be addressed\neither to me or to the bookshelf behind my head how lovely it is to\nhave a daughter\n\nOn this exit line she went out.",
    "God knows said Miss de Haviland what she will say to the police\n\nShell be all right said Sophia.",
    "She might say anything.",
    "Dont worry said Sophia.",
    "Shell play it the way the producer says.",
    "Im the producer\n\nShe went out after her mother then wheeled back to say\n\nHeres Chief Inspector Taverner to see you father.",
    "You dont mind if\nCharles stays do you\n\nI thought that a very faint air of bewilderment showed on Philip\nLeonides face.",
    "It well might But his incurious habit served me in good\nstead.",
    "He murmured Oh certainly  certainly in a rather vague\nvoice.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner came in solid dependable and with an air of\nbusinesslike promptitude that was somehow soothing.",
    "Just a little unpleasantness his manner seemed to say and then we\nshall be out of the house for good  and nobody will be more pleased\nthan I shall.",
    "We dont want to hang about I can assure you...",
    "I dont know how he managed without any words at all but merely by\ndrawing up a chair to the desk to convey what he did but it worked.",
    "I\nsat down unobtrusively a little way off.",
    "Yes Chief Inspector said Philip.",
    "Miss de Haviland said abruptly You dont want me Chief Inspector\n\nNot just at the moment Miss de Haviland.",
    "Later if I might have a few\nwords with you \n\nOf course.",
    "I shall be upstairs.",
    "She went out shutting the door behind her.",
    "Well Chief Inspector Philip repeated.",
    "I know youre a very busy gentleman and I dont want to disturb you\nfor long.",
    "But I may mention to you in confidence that our suspicions\nare confirmed.",
    "Your father did not die a natural death.",
    "His death was\nthe result of an overdose of physostigmine  more usually known as\neserine.",
    "Philip bowed his head.",
    "He showed no particular emotion.",
    "I dont know whether that suggests anything to you Taverner went\non.",
    "What should it suggest My own view is that my father must have\ntaken the poison by accident.",
    "You really think so Mr Leonides\n\n\fYes it seems to me perfectly possible.",
    "He was close on ninety\nremember and with very imperfect eyesight.",
    "So he emptied the contents of his eyedrop bottle into an insulin bottle.",
    "Does that really seem to you a credible suggestion Mr Leonides\n\nPhilip did not reply.",
    "His face became even more impassive.",
    "Taverner went on\n\nWe have found the eyedrop bottle empty  in the dustbin with no\nfingerprints on it.",
    "That in itself is curious.",
    "In the normal way there\nshould have been fingerprints.",
    "Certainly your fathers possibly his\nwifes or the valets...\n\nPhilip Leonides looked up.",
    "What about the valet he said.",
    "What about Johnson\n\nYou are suggesting Johnson as the possible criminal He certainly\nhad opportunity.",
    "But when we come to motive it is different.",
    "It was\nyour fathers custom to pay him a bonus every year  each year the\nbonus was increased.",
    "Your father made it clear to him that this was in\nlieu of any sum that he might otherwise have left him in his will.",
    "The\nbonus now after seven years service has reached a very\nconsiderable sum every year and is still rising.",
    "It was obviously to\nJohnsons interest that your father should live as long as possible.",
    "Moreover they were on excellent terms and Johnsons record of past\nservice is unimpeachable  he is a thoroughly skilled and faithful valet\nattendant.",
    "He paused.",
    "We do not suspect Johnson.",
    "Philip replied tonelessly I see.",
    "Now Mr Leonides perhaps you will give me a detailed account of\nyour own movements on the day of your fathers death\n\nCertainly Chief Inspector.",
    "I was here in this room all that day  with\nthe exception of meals of course.",
    "Did you see your father at all\n\nI said good morning to him after breakfast as was my custom.",
    "Were you alone with him then\n\nMy  er  stepmother was in the room.",
    "Did he seem quite as usual\n\nWith a slight hint of irony Philip replied He showed no foreknowledge\nthat he was to be murdered that day.",
    "Is your fathers portion of the house entirely separate from this\n\nYes the only access to it is through the door in the hall.",
    "Is that door kept locked\n\nNo.",
    "Never\n\nI have never known it to be so.",
    "Anyone could go freely between that part of the house and this\n\nCertainly.",
    "It was only separate from the point of view of domestic\nconvenience.",
    "How did you first hear of your fathers death\n\nMy brother Roger who occupies the west wing of the floor above\ncame rushing down to tell me that my father had had a sudden seizure.",
    "He had difficulty in breathing and seemed very ill.\n\nWhat did you do\n\nI telephoned through to the doctor which nobody seemed to have\nthought of doing.",
    "The doctor was out  but I left a message for him to\ncome as soon as possible.",
    "I then went upstairs.",
    "And then\n\nMy father was clearly very ill.",
    "He died before the doctor came.",
    "There\nwas no emotion in Philips voice.",
    "It was a simple statement of fact.",
    "Where was the rest of your family\n\n\fMy wife was in London.",
    "She returned shortly afterwards.",
    "Sophia was\nalso absent I believe.",
    "The two younger ones Eustace and Josephine\nwere at home.",
    "I hope you wont misunderstand me Mr Leonides if I ask you exactly\nhow your fathers death will affect your financial position.",
    "I quite appreciate that you want to know all the facts.",
    "My father made\nus financially independent a great many years ago.",
    "My brother he\nmade Chairman and principal shareholder of Associated Catering  his\nlargest Company and put the management of it entirely in his hands.",
    "He made over to me what he considered an equivalent sum  actually I\nthink it was a hundred and fifty thousand pounds in various bond and\nsecurities  so that I could use the capital as I chose.",
    "He also settled\nvery generous amounts on my two sisters which have since died.",
    "But he left himself still a very rich man\n\nNo actually he only retained for himself a comparatively modest\nincome.",
    "He said it would give him an interest in life.",
    "Since that time\nfor the first time a faint smile creased Philips lips he has become as\nresult of various undertakings an even richer man than he was\nbefore.",
    "Your brother and yourself came here to live.",
    "That was not the result of\nany financial  difficulties\n\nCertainly not.",
    "It was a mere matter of convenience.",
    "My father always\ntold us that we were welcome to make a home with him.",
    "For various\ndomestic reasons this was a convenient thing for me to do.",
    "I was also added Philip deliberately extremely fond of my father.",
    "I\ncame here with my family in 1937.",
    "I pay no rent but I pay my\nproportion of the rates.",
    "And your brother\n\nMy brother came here as a result of the Blitz when his house in\nLondon was bombed in 1943.",
    "Now Mr Leonides have you any idea what your fathers testamentary\ndispositions are\n\nA very clear idea.",
    "He remade his will shortly after peace was\ndeclared in 1945.",
    "My father was not a secretive man.",
    "He had a great\nsense of family.",
    "He held a family conclave at which his solicitor was\nalso present and who at his request made clear to us the terms of the\nwill.",
    "These terms I expect you already know.",
    "Mr Gaitskill will doubtless\nhave informed you.",
    "Roughly a sum of a hundred thousand pounds free\nof duty was left to my stepmother in addition to her already very\ngenerous marriage settlement.",
    "The residue of his property was\ndivided into three portions one to myself one to my brother and a\nthird in trust for the three grandchildren.",
    "The estate is a large one but\nthe death duties of course will be very heavy.",
    "Any bequests to servants or to charity\n\nNo bequests of any kind.",
    "The wages paid to servants were increased\nannually if they remained in his service.",
    "You are not  you will excuse my asking  in actual need of money Mr\nLeonides\n\nIncome tax as you know is somewhat heavy.",
    "Chief Inspector  but my\nincome amply suffices for my needs  and for my wifes.",
    "Moreover my\nfather frequently made us all very generous gifts and had any\nemergency arisen he would have come to the rescue immediately.",
    "Philip added coldly and clearly\n\nI can assure you that I had no financial reason for desiring my fathers\ndeath.",
    "Chief Inspector.",
    "I am very sorry Mr Leonides if you think I suggested anything of the\nkind.",
    "But we have to get at all the facts.",
    "Now Im afraid I must ask you\nsome rather delicate questions.",
    "They refer to the relations between\nyour father and his wife.",
    "Were they on happy terms together\n\nAs far as I know perfectly.",
    "No quarrels\n\nI do not think so.",
    "There was a  great disparity in age\n\nThere was.",
    "Did you  excuse me  approve of your fathers second marriage\n\n\fMy approval was not asked.",
    "That is not an answer Mr Leonides.",
    "Since you press the point I will say that I considered the marriage unwise.",
    "Did you remonstrate with your father about it\n\nWhen I heard of it it was an accomplished fact.",
    "Rather a shock to you  eh\n\nPhilip did not reply.",
    "Was there any bad feeling about the matter\n\nMy father was at perfect liberty to do as he pleased.",
    "Your relations with Mrs Leonides have been amicable\n\nPerfectly.",
    "You were on friendly terms with her\n\nWe very seldom meet.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner shifted his ground.",
    "Can you tell me something about Mr Laurence Brown\n\n\fIm afraid I cant.",
    "He was engaged by my father.",
    "But he was engaged to teach your children Mr Leonides.",
    "True.",
    "My son was a sufferer from infantile paralysis  fortunately a\nlight case  and it was considered not advisable to send him to a public\nschool.",
    "My father suggested that he and my young daughter Josephine\nshould have a private tutor  the choice at the time was rather limited since the tutor in question must be ineligible for military service.",
    "This\nyoung mans credentials were satisfactory my father and my aunt\nwho has always looked after the childrens welfare were satisfied\nand I acquiesced.",
    "I may add that I have no fault to find with his\nteaching which has been conscientious and adequate.",
    "His living quarters are in your fathers part of the house not here\n\nThere was more room up there.",
    "Have you ever noticed  I am sorry to ask this  any signs of intimacy\nbetween Laurence Brown and your stepmother\n\nI have had no opportunity of observing anything of the kind.",
    "Have you heard any gossip or tittle tattle on the subject\n\nI dont listen to gossip or tittle tattle Chief Inspector.",
    "Very creditable said Inspector Taverner.",
    "So youve seen no evil\nheard no evil and arent speaking any evil\n\n\fIf you like to put it that way.",
    "Chief Inspector.",
    "Inspector Taverner got up.",
    "Well he said thank you very much Mr Leonides.",
    "I followed him unobtrusively out of the room.",
    "Whew said Taverner hes a cold fish\n\nChapter 7\n\nAnd now said Taverner well go and have a word with Mrs Philip.",
    "Magda West her stage name is.",
    "Is she any good I asked.",
    "I know her name and I believe Ive seen\nher in various shows but I cant remember when and where.",
    "Shes one of those Near Successes said Taverner.",
    "Shes starred\nonce or twice in the West End shes made quite a name for herself in\nRepertory  she plays a lot for the little highbrow theatres and the\nSunday clubs.",
    "The truth is I think shes been handicapped by not\nhaving to earn her living at it.",
    "Shes been able to pick and choose and\nto go where she likes and occasionally to put up the money to finance\na show where shes fancied a certain part  usually the last part in the\nworld to suit her.",
    "Result is shes receded a bit into the amateur class\nrather than the professional.",
    "Shes good mind you especially in\n\n\fcomedy  but managers dont like her much  they say shes too\nindependent and shes a trouble maker  foments rows and enjoys a\nbit of mischief making.",
    "I dont know how much of it is true  but shes\nnot too popular amongst her fellow artists.",
    "Sophia came out of the drawing room and said My mother is in here\nChief Inspector.",
    "I followed Taverner into the big drawing room.",
    "For a moment I hardly\nrecognised the woman who sat on the brocaded settee.",
    "The Titian hair was piled high on her head in an Edwardian coiffure\nand she was dressed in a well cut dark grey coat and skirt with a\ndelicately pleated pale mauve shirt fastened at the neck by a small\ncameo brooch.",
    "For the first time I was aware of the charm of her\ndelightfully tip tilted nose.",
    "I was faintly reminded of Athene Seyler  and it seemed quite\nimpossible to believe that this was the tempestuous creature in the\npeach negligee.",
    "Inspector Taverner she said.",
    "Do come in and sit down.",
    "Will you\nsmoke This is a most terrible business.",
    "I simply feel at the moment\nthat I just cant take it.",
    "Her voice was low and emotionless the voice of a person determined\nat all costs to display self control.",
    "She went on Please tell me if I can\nhelp you in any way.",
    "Thank you Mrs Leonides.",
    "Where were you at the time of the\ntragedy\n\nI suppose I must have been driving down from London.",
    "Id lunched\nthat day at the Ivy with a friend.",
    "Then wed gone to a dress show.",
    "We\nhad a drink with some other friends at the Berkeley.",
    "Then I started\nhome.",
    "When I got here everything was in commotion.",
    "It seemed my\nfatherinlaw had had a sudden seizure.",
    "He was  dead.",
    "Her voice trembled just a little.",
    "You were fond of your fatherinlaw\n\nI was devoted \n\nHer voice rose.",
    "Sophia adjusted very slightly the angle of the Degas\npicture.",
    "Magdas voice dropped to its former subdued tone.",
    "I was very fond of him she said in a quiet voice.",
    "We all were.",
    "He\nwas  very good to us.",
    "Did you get on well with Mrs Leonides\n\nWe didnt see very much of Brenda.",
    "Why was that\n\nWell we hadnt much in common.",
    "Poor dear Brenda.",
    "Life must have\nbeen hard for her sometimes.",
    "Again Sophia fiddled with the Degas.",
    "Indeed In what way\n\nOh I dont know.",
    "Magda shook her head with a sad little smile.",
    "Was Mrs Leonides happy with her husband\n\nOh I think so.",
    "No quarrels\n\nAgain the slight smiling shake of the head.",
    "I really dont know Inspector.",
    "Their part of the house is quite\nseparate.",
    "She and Mr Laurence Brown were very friendly were they not\n\nMagda Leonides stiffened.",
    "Her eyes opened reproachfully at Taverner.",
    "I dont think she said with dignity that you ought to ask me things\nlike that.",
    "Brenda was quite friendly to everyone.",
    "She is really a very\namiable sort of person.",
    "Do you like Mr Laurence Brown\n\nHes very quiet.",
    "Quite nice but you hardly know hes there.",
    "I havent\nreally seen very much of him.",
    "Is his teaching satisfactory\n\nI suppose so.",
    "I really wouldnt know.",
    "Philip seems quite satisfied.",
    "Taverner essayed some shock tactics.",
    "Im sorry to ask you this but in your opinion was there anything in the\nnature of a love affair between Mr Brown and Mrs Brenda Leonides.",
    "Magda got up.",
    "She was very much the grande dame.",
    "I have never seen any evidence of anything of that kind she said.",
    "I\ndont think really.",
    "Inspector that that is a question you ought to ask\nme.",
    "She was my fatherinlaws wife.",
    "I almost applauded.",
    "The Chief Inspector also rose.",
    "More a question for the servants he suggested.",
    "Magda did not answer.",
    "Thank you Mrs Leonides said the Inspector and went out.",
    "You did that beautifully darling said Sophia to her mother warmly.",
    "Magda twisted up a curl reflectively behind her right ear and looked at\nherself in the glass.",
    "Yees she said I think it was the right way to play it.",
    "Sophia looked at me.",
    "Oughtnt you she asked to go with the Inspector\n\nLook here Sophia what am I supposed \n\nI stopped.",
    "I could not very well ask outright in front of Sophias mother\nexactly what my r\u00f4le was supposed to be.",
    "Magda Leonides had so far\nevinced no interest in my presence at all except as a useful recipient\nof an exit line on daughters.",
    "I might be a reporter her daughters\nfiance or an obscure hangeron of the police force or even an\nundertaker  to Magda Leonides they would one and all come under the\ngeneral heading of audience.",
    "Looking down at her feet Mrs Leonides said with dissatisfaction\n\nThese shoes are wrong.",
    "Frivolous.",
    "Obeying Sophias imperious wave of the head I hurried after Taverner.",
    "I caught up with him in the outer hall just going through the door to the\nstairway.",
    "Just going up to see the older brother he explained.",
    "I put my problem to him without more ado.",
    "Look here Taverner who am I supposed to be\n\n\fHe looked surprised.",
    "Who are you supposed to be\n\nYes what am I doing here in this house If anyone asks me what do I\nsay\n\nOh I see.",
    "He considered a moment.",
    "Then he smiled.",
    "Has anybody\nasked you\n\nWell  no.",
    "Then why not leave it at that.",
    "Never explain.",
    "Thats a very good motto.",
    "Especially in a house upset like this house is.",
    "Everyone is far too full of\ntheir own private worries and fears to be in a questioning mood.",
    "Theyll\ntake you for granted so long as you just seem sure of yourself.",
    "Its a\ngreat mistake ever to say anything when you neednt.",
    "Hm now we go\nthrough this door and up the stairs.",
    "Nothing locked.",
    "Of course you\nrealise I expect that these questions Im asking are all a lot of hooey.",
    "Doesnt matter a hoot who was in the house and who wasnt or where\nthey all were on that particular day \n\nThen why \n\nHe went on Because it at least gives me a chance to look at them all\nand size them up and hear what theyve got to say and to hope that\nquite by chance somebody might give me a useful pointer.",
    "He was\nsilent a moment and then murmured I bet Mrs Magda Leonides could\nspill a mouthful if she chose.",
    "Would it be reliable I asked.",
    "Oh no said Taverner it wouldnt be reliable.",
    "But it might start a\npossible line of enquiry.",
    "Everybody in the damned house had means\nand opportunity.",
    "What I want is a motive.",
    "At the top of the stairs a door barred off the right hand corridor.",
    "There\nwas a brass knocker on it and Inspector Taverner duly knocked.",
    "It was opened with startling suddenness by a man who must have been\nstanding just inside.",
    "He was a clumsy giant of a man with powerful\nshoulders dark rumpled hair and an exceedingly ugly but at the same\ntime rather pleasant face.",
    "His eyes looked at us and then quickly away\nin that furtive embarrassed manner which shy but honest people often\nadopt.",
    "Oh I say he said.",
    "Come in.",
    "Yes do.",
    "I was going  but it doesnt\nmatter.",
    "Come into the sitting room.",
    "Ill get Clemency  oh youre there\ndarling.",
    "Its Chief Inspector Taverner.",
    "He  are there any cigarettes\nJust wait a minute.",
    "If you dont mind \n\nHe collided with a screen said I beg your pardon to it in a flustered\nmanner and went out of the room.",
    "It was rather like the exit of a bumble bee and left a noticeable silence\nbehind it.",
    "Mrs Roger Leonides was standing up by the window.",
    "I was intrigued at\nonce by her personality and by the atmosphere of the room in which\nwe stood.",
    "It was quite definitely her room.",
    "I was sure of that.",
    "The walls were painted white  really white not an ivory or a pale\ncream which is what one usually means when one says white in\nhouse decoration.",
    "They had no pictures on them except one over the\nmantelpiece a geometrical fantasia in triangles of dark grey and\nbattleship blue.",
    "There was hardly any furniture  only mere utilitarian necessities three\nor four chairs a glass topped table one small bookshelf.",
    "There were\nno ornaments.",
    "There was light and space and air.",
    "It was as different\nfrom the big brocaded and flowered drawing room on the floor below\nas chalk from cheese.",
    "And Mrs Roger Leonides was as different from\nMrs Philip Leonides as one woman could be from another.",
    "Whilst one\nfelt that Magda Leonides could be and often was at least half a dozen\ndifferent women.",
    "Clemency Leonides I was sure could never be\nanyone but herself.",
    "She was a woman of very sharp and definite\npersonality.",
    "She was about fifty I suppose her hair was grey cut very short in\nwhat was almost an Eton crop but which grew so beautifully on her\nsmall well shaped head that it had none of the ugliness I have always\nassociated with that particular cut.",
    "She had an intelligent sensitive\nface with light grey eyes of a peculiar and searching intensity.",
    "She\nhad on a simple dark red woollen frock that fitted her slenderness\nperfectly.",
    "She was I felt at once rather an alarming woman...",
    "I think because I\njudged that the standards by which she lived might not be those of an\n\n\fordinary woman.",
    "I understood at once why Sophia had used the word\nruthlessness in connection with her.",
    "The room was cold and I shivered a little.",
    "Clemency Leonides said in a\nquiet well bred voice\n\nDo sit down Chief Inspector.",
    "Is there any further news\n\nDeath was due to eserine Mrs Leonides.",
    "She said thoughtfully\n\nSo that makes it murder.",
    "It couldnt have been an accident of any\nkind could it\n\nNo Mrs Leonides.",
    "Please be very gentle with my husband Chief Inspector.",
    "This will\naffect him very much.",
    "He worshipped his father and he feels things\nvery acutely.",
    "He is an emotional person.",
    "You were on good terms with your fatherinlaw Mrs Leonides\n\nYes on quite good terms.",
    "She added quietly I did not like him very\nmuch.",
    "Why was that\n\nI disliked his objectives in life  and his methods of attaining them.",
    "And Mrs Brenda Leonides\n\nBrenda I never saw very much of her.",
    "Do you think it is possible that there was anything between her and Mr\nLaurence Brown\n\nYou mean  some kind of a love affair I shouldnt think so.",
    "But I really\nwouldnt know anything about it.",
    "Her voice sounded completely uninterested.",
    "Roger Leonides came back with a rush and the same bumble bee\neffect.",
    "I got held up he said.",
    "Telephone.",
    "Well Inspector Well Have you\ngot any news What caused my fathers death\n\nDeath was due to eserine poisoning.",
    "It was My God Then it was that woman She couldnt wait He took\nher more or less out of the gutter and this is his reward.",
    "She murdered\nhim in cold blood God it makes my blood boil to think of it.",
    "Have you any particular reason for thinking that Taverner asked.",
    "Roger was pacing up and down tugging at his hair with both hands.",
    "Reason Why who else could it be Ive never trusted her  never\nliked her Weve none of us liked her.",
    "Philip and I were both appalled\n\n\fwhen Dad came home one day and told us what he had done At his\nage It was madness  madness.",
    "My father was an amazing man.",
    "Inspector.",
    "In intellect he was as young and fresh as a man of forty.",
    "Everything I have in the world I owe to him.",
    "He did everything for me never failed me.",
    "It was I who failed him  when I think of it \n\nHe dropped heavily onto a chair.",
    "His wife came quietly to his side.",
    "Now Roger thats enough.",
    "Dont work yourself up.",
    "I know dearest  I know he took her hand.",
    "But how can I keep calm\n how can I help feeling \n\nBut we must all keep calm Roger.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner wants\nour help.",
    "That is right Mrs Leonides.",
    "Roger cried\n\nDo you know what Id like to do Id like to strangle that woman with\nmy own hands.",
    "Grudging that dear old man a few extra years of life.",
    "If I\nhad her here  He sprang up.",
    "He was shaking with rage.",
    "He held out\nconvulsive hands.",
    "Yes Id wring her neck wring her neck...\n\nRoger said Clemency sharply.",
    "He looked at her abashed.",
    "Sorry dearest.",
    "He turned to us.",
    "I do apologise.",
    "My feelings get the\nbetter of me.",
    "I  excuse me \n\nHe went out of the room again.",
    "Clemency Leonides said with a very\nfaint smile\n\nReally you know he wouldnt hurt a fly.",
    "Taverner accepted her remark politely.",
    "Then he started on his socalled routine questions.",
    "Clemency Leonides replied concisely and accurately.",
    "Roger Leonides had been in London on the day of his fathers death at\nBox House the headquarters of the Associated Catering.",
    "He had\nreturned early in the afternoon and had spent some time with his\nfather as was his custom.",
    "She herself had been as usual at the\nLambert Institute on Gower Street where she worked.",
    "She had\nreturned to the house just before six oclock.",
    "Did you see your fatherinlaw\n\nNo.",
    "The last time I saw him was on the day before.",
    "We had coffee with\nhim after dinner.",
    "But you did not see him on the day of his death\n\nNo.",
    "I actually went over to his part of the house because Roger\nthought he had left his pipe there  a very precious pipe but as it\n\n\fhappened he had left it on the hall table there so I did not need to\ndisturb the old man.",
    "He often dozed off about six.",
    "When did you hear of his illness\n\nBrenda came rushing over.",
    "That was just a minute or two after half\npast six.",
    "These questions as I knew were unimportant but I was aware how\nkeen was Inspector Taverners scrutiny of the woman who answered\nthem.",
    "He asked her a few questions about the nature of her work in\nLondon.",
    "She said that it had to do with the radiation effects of atomic\ndisintegration.",
    "You work on the atom bomb in fact\n\nThe work has nothing destructive about it.",
    "The Institute is carrying\nout experiments on the therapeutic effects.",
    "When Taverner got up he expressed a wish to look around their part\nof the house.",
    "She seemed a little surprised but showed him its extent\nreadily enough.",
    "The bedroom with its twin beds and white coverlets\nand its simplified toilet appliances reminded me again of a hospital or\nsome monastic cell.",
    "The bathroom too was severely plain with no\nspecial luxury fitting and no array of cosmetics.",
    "The kitchen was bare\nspotlessly clean and well equipped with labour saving devices of a\npractical kind.",
    "Then we came to a door which Clemency opened\nsaying This is my husbands special room.",
    "Come in said Roger.",
    "Come in.",
    "I drew a faint breath of relief.",
    "Something in the spotless austerity\nelsewhere had been getting me down.",
    "This was an intensely personal\nroom.",
    "There was a large roll top desk untidily covered with papers old\npipes and tobacco ash.",
    "There were big shabby easy chairs.",
    "Persian\nrugs covered the floor.",
    "On the walls were groups their photography somewhat faded.",
    "School\ngroups cricket groups military groups.",
    "Water colour sketches of\ndeserts and minarets and of sailing boats and sea effects and\nsunsets.",
    "It was somehow a pleasant room the room of a lovable\nfriendly companionable man.",
    "Roger clumsily was pouring out drinks from a tantalus sweeping\nbooks and papers off one of the chairs.",
    "Place is in a mess.",
    "I was turning out.",
    "Clearing up old papers.",
    "Say\nwhen.",
    "The Inspector declined a drink.",
    "I accepted.",
    "You must forgive me just now went on Roger.",
    "He brought my drink\nover to me turning his head to speak to Taverner as he did so.",
    "My\nfeelings ran away with me.",
    "He looked around almost guiltily but Clemency Leonides had not\naccompanied us into the room.",
    "Shes so wonderful he said.",
    "My wife I mean.",
    "All through this shes\nbeen splendid  splendid I cant tell you how I admire that woman.",
    "And\nshes had such a hard time  a terrible time.",
    "Id like to tell you about it.",
    "Before we were married I mean.",
    "Her first husband was a fine chap \n\n\ffine mind I mean  but terribly delicate  tubercular as a matter of fact.",
    "He was doing some very valuable research work on crystallography I\nbelieve.",
    "Poorly paid and very exacting but he wouldnt give up.",
    "She\nslaved for him practically kept him knowing all the time that he was\ndying.",
    "And never a complaint  never a murmur of wanness.",
    "She\nalways said she was happy.",
    "Then he died and she was terribly cut up.",
    "At last she agreed to marry me.",
    "I was glad to be able to give her some\nrest some happiness I wished she would stop working but of course\nshe felt it her duty in war time and she still seems to feel she should go\non.",
    "Shes been a wonderful wife  the most wonderful wife a man ever\nhad.",
    "Gosh Ive been lucky Id do anything for her.",
    "Taverner made a suitable rejoinder.",
    "Then he embarked once more on\nthe familiar routine questions.",
    "When had he first heard of his fathers\nillness\n\nBrenda had rushed over to call me.",
    "My father was ill  she said he had\nhad a seizure of some sort.",
    "Id been sitting with the dear old boy only about half an hour earlier.",
    "Hed been perfectly all right then.",
    "I rushed over.",
    "He was blue in the\nface gasping.",
    "I dashed down to Philip.",
    "He rang up the doctor.",
    "I  we\ncouldnt do anything.",
    "Of course I never dreamed for a moment then\nthat there had been any funny business.",
    "Funny Did I say funny God\nwhat a word to use.",
    "With a little difficulty Taverner and I disentangled ourselves from the\nemotional atmosphere of Roger Leonidess room and found ourselves\noutside the door once more at the top of the stairs.",
    "Whew said Taverner.",
    "What a contrast from the other brother.",
    "He\nadded rather inconsequently Curious things rooms.",
    "Tell you quite a\nlot about the people who live in them.",
    "I agreed and he went on.",
    "Curious the people who marry each other too isnt it\n\nI was not quite sure if he was referring to Clemency and Roger or to\nPhilip and Magda.",
    "His words applied equally well to either.",
    "Yet it\nseemed to me that both the marriages might be classed as happy\nones.",
    "Rogers and Clemencys certainly was.",
    "I shouldnt say he was a poisoner would you asked Taverner.",
    "Not\noff hand I wouldnt.",
    "Of course you never know.",
    "Now shes more the\ntype.",
    "Remorseless sort of woman.",
    "Might be a bit mad.",
    "Again I agreed.",
    "But I dont suppose I said that shed murder\nanyone just because she didnt approve of their aims and mode of life.",
    "Perhaps if she really hated the old man  but are any murders\ncommitted just out of pure hate\n\nPrecious few said Taverner.",
    "Ive never come across one myself.",
    "No I think were a good deal safer to stick to Mrs Brenda.",
    "But God\nknows if well ever get any evidence.",
    "Chapter 8\n\n\fA parlourmaid opened the door of the opposite wing to us.",
    "She looked\nscared but slightly contemptuous when she saw Taverner.",
    "You want to see the mistress\n\nYes please.",
    "She showed us into a big drawing room and went out.",
    "Its proportions were the same as the drawing room on the ground floor\nbelow.",
    "There were coloured cretonnes very gay in colour and striped silk\ncurtains.",
    "Over the mantelpiece was a portrait that held my gaze\nriveted  not only because of the master hand that had painted it but\nalso because of the arresting face of the subject.",
    "It was the portrait of a little old man with dark piercing eyes.",
    "He wore a\nblack velvet skull cap and his head was sunk down in his shoulders\nbut the vitality and power of the man radiated forth from the canvas.",
    "The twinkling eyes seemed to hold mine.",
    "Thats him said Chief Inspector Taverner ungrammatically.",
    "Painted\nby Augustus John.",
    "Got a personality hasnt he\n\nYes I said and felt the monosyllable was inadequate.",
    "I understood now just what Edith de Haviland had meant when she\nsaid the house seemed so empty without him.",
    "This was the Original\n\n\fCrooked Little Man who had built the Crooked Little House  and\nwithout him the Crooked Little House had lost its meaning.",
    "Thats his first wife over there painted by Sargent said Taverner.",
    "I examined the picture on the wall between the windows.",
    "It had a\ncertain cruelty like many of Sargents portraits.",
    "The length of the face\nwas exaggerated I thought  so was the faint suggestion of horsiness the indisputable correctness  it was a portrait of a typical English\nLady  in Country not Smart Society.",
    "Handsome but rather lifeless.",
    "A\nmost unlikely wife for the grinning powerful little despot over the\nmantelpiece.",
    "The door opened and Sergeant Lamb stepped in.",
    "Ive done what I could with the servants sir he said.",
    "Didnt get\nanything.",
    "Taverner sighed.",
    "Sergeant Lamb took out his notebook and retreated to the far end of\nthe room where he seated himself unobtrusively.",
    "The door opened again and Aristide Leonidess second wife came into\nthe room.",
    "She wore black  very expensive black and a good deal of it.",
    "It swathed her up to the neck and down to the wrists.",
    "She moved easily\nand indolently and black certainly suited her.",
    "Her face was mildly\npretty and she had rather nice brown hair arranged in somewhat too\nelaborate a style.",
    "Her face was well powdered and she had on lipstick\nand rouge but she had clearly been crying.",
    "She was wearing a string\n\n\fof very large pearls and she had a big emerald ring on one hand and an\nenormous ruby on the other.",
    "There was one other thing I noticed about her.",
    "She looked frightened.",
    "Good morning Mrs Leonides said Taverner easily.",
    "Im sorry to\nhave to trouble you again.",
    "She said in a flat voice I suppose it cant be helped.",
    "You understand dont you Mrs Leonides that if you wish your\nsolicitor to be present that is perfectly in order.",
    "I wondered if she did understand the significance of those words.",
    "Apparently not.",
    "She merely said rather sulkily I dont like Mr Gaitskill.",
    "I dont want\nhim.",
    "You could have your own solicitor Mrs Leonides.",
    "Must I I dont like solicitors.",
    "They confuse me.",
    "Its entirely for you to decide said Taverner producing an automatic\nsmile.",
    "Shall we go on then\n\nSergeant Lamb licked his pencil.",
    "Brenda Leonides sat down on a sofa\nfacing Taverner.",
    "Have you found out anything she asked.",
    "I noticed her fingers nervously twisting and untwisting a pleat of the\nchiffon of her dress.",
    "We can state definitely now that your husband died as a result of\neserine poisoning.",
    "You mean those eyedrops killed him\n\nIt seems quite certain that when you gave Mr Leonides that last\ninjection it was eserine that you injected and not insulin.",
    "But I didnt know that.",
    "I didnt have anything to do with it.",
    "Really I\ndidnt Inspector.",
    "Then somebody must have deliberately replaced the insulin by the\neyedrops.",
    "What a wicked thing to do\n\nYes Mrs Leonides.",
    "Do you think  someone did it on purpose Or by accident It couldnt\nhave been a  a joke could it\n\nTaverner said smoothly We dont think it was a joke Mrs Leonides.",
    "It must have been one of the servants.",
    "Taverner did not answer.",
    "It must.",
    "I dont see who else could have done it.",
    "Are you sure Think Mrs Leonides.",
    "Havent you any ideas at all\nTheres been no ill feeling anywhere No quarrel No grudge\n\nShe still stared at him with large defiant eyes.",
    "Ive no idea at all she said.",
    "You had been at the cinema that afternoon you said\n\nYes  I came in at half past six  it was time for the insulin  I  I  gave\nhim the injection just the same as usual and he went all queer.",
    "I was\nterrified  I rushed over to Roger  Ive told you all this before.",
    "Have I\ngot to go over it again and again Her voice rose hysterically.",
    "Im so sorry Mrs Leonides.",
    "Now can I speak to Mr Brown\n\nTo Laurence Why He doesnt know anything about it.",
    "Id like to speak to him all the same.",
    "She stared at him suspiciously.",
    "Eustace is doing Latin with him in the schoolroom.",
    "Do you want him to\ncome here\n\nNo  well go to him.",
    "Taverner went quickly out of the room.",
    "The Sergeant and I followed.",
    "Youve put the wind up her sir said Sergeant Lamb.",
    "Taverner grunted.",
    "He led the way up a short flight of steps and along a\npassage into a big room looking over the garden.",
    "There a fair haired young man of about thirty and a handsome dark boy\nof sixteen were sitting at a table.",
    "They looked up at our entrance.",
    "Sophias brother Eustace looked at\nme Laurence Brown fixed an agonised gaze on Chief Inspector\nTaverner.",
    "I have never seen a man look so completely paralysed with fright.",
    "He\nstood up then sat down again.",
    "He said and his voice was almost a\nsqueak\n\nOh  er  good morning.",
    "Inspector.",
    "Good morning Taverner was curt.",
    "Can I have a word with you\n\nYes of course.",
    "Only too pleased.",
    "At least \n\nEustace got up.",
    "Do you want me to go away.",
    "Chief Inspector His voice was pleasant\nwith a faintly arrogant note.",
    "We  we can continue our studies later said the tutor.",
    "Eustace strolled negligently towards the door.",
    "He walked rather stiffly.",
    "Just as he went through the door he caught my eye drew a forefinger\nacross the front of his throat and grinned.",
    "Then he shut the door\nbehind him.",
    "Well Mr Brown said Taverner.",
    "The analysis is quite definite.",
    "It was\neserine that caused Mr Leonidess death.",
    "I  you mean  Mr Leonides was really poisoned I have been hoping \n\nHe was poisoned said Taverner curtly.",
    "Someone substituted\neserine eyedrops for insulin.",
    "I cant believe it... Its incredible.",
    "The question is who had a motive\n\nNobody.",
    "Nobody at all The young mans voice rose excitedly.",
    "You wouldnt like to have your solicitor present would you inquired\nTaverner.",
    "I havent got a solicitor.",
    "I dont want one.",
    "I have nothing to hide nothing...\n\nAnd you quite understand that what you say is about to be taken\ndown.",
    "Im innocent  I assure you Im innocent.",
    "I have not suggested anything else.",
    "Taverner paused.",
    "Mrs Leonides was a good deal younger than her\nhusband was she not\n\nI  I suppose so  I mean well yes.",
    "She must have felt lonely sometimes\n\nLaurence Brown did not answer.",
    "He passed his tongue over his dry\nlips.",
    "To have a companion of more or less her own age living here must\nhave been agreeable to her\n\nI  no not at all  I mean  I dont know.",
    "It seems to me quite natural that an attachment should have sprung\nup between you.",
    "The young man protested vehemently.",
    "It didnt It wasnt Nothing of the kind I know what youre thinking\nbut it wasnt so Mrs Leonides was very kind to me always and I had the\ngreatest  the greatest respect for her  but nothing more  nothing\nmore I do assure you.",
    "Its monstrous to suggest things of that kind\nMonstrous I wouldnt kill anybody  or tamper with bottles  or anything\nlike that.",
    "Im very sensitive and highly strung.",
    "I  the very idea of killing\nis a nightmare to me  they quite understood that at the tribunal  I have\n\n\freligious objections to killing.",
    "I did hospital work instead  stoking\nboilers  terribly heavy work  I couldnt go on with it  but they let me\ntake up educational work.",
    "I have done my best here with Eustace and\nwith Josephine  a very intelligent child but difficult.",
    "And everybody\nhas been most kind to me  Mr Leonides and Mrs Leonides and Miss de\nHaviland.",
    "And now this awful thing happens... And you suspect me me  of murder\n\nInspector Taverner looked at him with a slow appraising interest.",
    "I havent said so he remarked.",
    "But you think so I know you think so They all think so They look at\nme.",
    "I  I cant go on talking to you.",
    "Im not well.",
    "He hurried out of the room.",
    "Taverner turned his head slowly to look at\nme.",
    "Well what do you think of him\n\nHes scared stiff.",
    "Yes I know but is he a murderer\n\nIf you ask me said Sergeant Lamb hed never have had the nerve.",
    "Hed never have bashed anyone on the head or shot off a pistol\nagreed the Chief Inspector But in this particular crime what is there\nto do Just monkey about with a couple of bottles... Just help a very\nold man out of the world in a comparatively painless manner.",
    "Practically euthanasia said the Sergeant.",
    "And then perhaps after\na decent interval marriage with a woman who inherits a hundred\nthousand pounds free of legacy duty who already has about the same\namount settled upon her and who has in addition pearls and rubies\nand emeralds the size of whatsitsname eggs\n\nAh well  Taverner sighed.",
    "Its all theory and conjecture I managed\nto scare him all right but that doesnt prove anything.",
    "Hes just as\nlikely to be scared if hes innocent.",
    "And anyway I rather doubt if he\nwas the one actually to do it.",
    "More likely to have been the woman  only\nwhy on earth didnt she throw away the insulin bottle or rinse it out\nHe turned to the Sergeant.",
    "No evidence from the servants about any\ngoings on\n\nThe parlourmaid says theyre sweet on each other.",
    "What grounds\n\nThe way he looks at her when she pours out his coffee.",
    "Fat lot of good that would be in a court of law Definitely no carryings\non\n\nNot that anybodys seen.",
    "I bet they would have seen too if there had been anything to see.",
    "You\nknow Im beginning to believe there really is nothing between them.",
    "He looked at me.",
    "Go back and talk to her.",
    "Id like your impression of\nher.",
    "I went half reluctantly yet I was interested.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nI found Brenda Leonides sitting exactly where I had left her.",
    "She\nlooked up sharply as I entered.",
    "Wheres Inspector Taverner Is he coming back\n\nNot just yet.",
    "Who are you\n\nAt last I had been asked the question that I had been expecting all the\nmorning.",
    "I answered it with reasonable truth.",
    "Im connected with the police but Im also a friend of the family.",
    "The family Beasts I hate them all.",
    "She looked at me her mouth working.",
    "She looked sullen and\nfrightened and angry.",
    "Theyve been beastly to me always  always.",
    "From the very first.",
    "Why\nshouldnt I marry their precious father What did it matter to them\nTheyd all got loads of money.",
    "He gave it to them.",
    "They wouldnt have\nhad the brains to make any for themselves\n\n\fShe went on\n\nWhy shouldnt a man marry again  even if he is a bit old And he\nwasnt really old at all  not in himself.",
    "I was very fond of him.",
    "I was fond\nof him.",
    "She looked at me defiantly.",
    "I see I said.",
    "I see.",
    "I suppose you dont believe that  but its true.",
    "I was sick of men.",
    "I\nwanted to have a home  I wanted someone to make a fuss of me and\nsay nice things to me.",
    "Aristide said lovely things to me  and he could\nmake you laugh  and he was clever.",
    "He thought up all sorts of smart\nways to get round all these silly regulations.",
    "He was very very clever.",
    "Im not glad hes dead.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "She leaned back on the sofa.",
    "She had rather a wide mouth it curled up\nsideways in a queer sleepy smile.",
    "Ive been happy here.",
    "Ive been safe.",
    "I went to all those posh\ndressmakers  the ones Id read about.",
    "I was as good as anybody.",
    "And\nAristide gave me lovely things.",
    "She stretched out a hand looking at\nthe ruby on it.",
    "Just for a moment I saw the hand and arm like an outstretched cats\nclaw and heard her voice as a purr.",
    "She was still smiling to herself.",
    "Whats wrong with that she demanded.",
    "I was nice to him.",
    "I made him happy.",
    "She leaned forward.",
    "Do you\nknow how I met him\n\nShe went on without waiting for an answer.",
    "It was in the Gay Shamrock.",
    "Hed ordered scrambled eggs on toast\nand when I brought them to him I was crying.",
    "Sit down he said and\ntell me whats the matter.",
    "Oh I couldnt I said.",
    "Id get the sack if I did\na thing like that.",
    "No you wont he said I own this place.",
    "I looked at\nhim then.",
    "Such an odd little old man he was I thought at first  but hed\ngot a sort of power.",
    "I told him all about it... Youll have heard about it all\nfrom them I expect  making out I was a regular bad lot  but I wasnt.",
    "I\nwas brought up very carefully.",
    "We had a shop  a very high class shop art needlework.",
    "I was never the sort of girl who had a lot of boy friends\nor made herself cheap.",
    "But Terry was different.",
    "He was Irish  and he\nwas going overseas...",
    "He never wrote or anything.",
    "I suppose I was a\nfool.",
    "So there it was you see.",
    "I was in trouble  just like some dreadful\nlittle servant girl...",
    "Her voice was disdainful in its snobbery.",
    "Aristide was wonderful.",
    "He said everything would be all right.",
    "He said\nhe was lonely.",
    "Wed be married at once he said.",
    "It was like a dream.",
    "And then I found out he was the great Mr Leonides.",
    "He owned masses\nof shops and restaurants and night clubs.",
    "It was quite like a fairy tale\nwasnt it\n\nOne kind of a fairy tale I said drily.",
    "We were married at a little church in the City  and then we went\nabroad.",
    "And the child\n\nShe looked at me with eyes that came back from a long distance.",
    "There wasnt a child after all.",
    "It was all a mistake.",
    "She smiled the curled up sideways crooked smile.",
    "I vowed to myself that Id be a really good wife to him and I was.",
    "I\nordered all the kinds of food he liked and wore the colours he fancied\nand I did all I could to please him.",
    "And he was happy.",
    "But we never got\nrid of that family of his.",
    "Always coming and sponging and living in his\npocket.",
    "Old Miss de Haviland  I think she ought to have gone away\nwhen he got married.",
    "I said so.",
    "But Aristide said Shes been here so\nlong.",
    "Its her home now.",
    "The truth is he liked to have them all about\nand underfoot.",
    "They were beastly to me but he never seemed to\nnotice that or to mind about it.",
    "Roger hates me  have you seen Roger\nHes always hated me.",
    "Hes jealous.",

    "And now theyre trying to pretend I murdered him  and I\ndidnt  I didnt She leaned towards me.",
    "Please believe I didnt\n\nI found her very pathetic.",
    "The contemptuous way the Leonides family\nhad spoken of her their eagerness to believe that she had committed\nthe crime  now at this moment it all seemed positively inhuman\nconduct.",
    "She was alone defenceless hunted down.",
    "And if its not me they think its Laurence she went on.",
    "What about Laurence I asked.",
    "Im terribly sorry for Laurence.",
    "Hes delicate and he couldnt go and\nfight.",

    "She has horrible\nsneaky ways and she looks queer... She gives me the shivers\nsometimes.",
    "I didnt want to talk about Josephine.",
    "I harked back to Laurence\nBrown.",

    "Where does he come from\n\nI had phrased it clumsily.",
    "She flushed.",
    "He isnt anybody particular.",
    "Hes just like me... What chance have we\ngot against all of them\n\nDont you think youre being a little hysterical\n\nNo I dont.",
    "They want to make out that Laurence did it  or that I did.",
    "Theyve got that policeman on their side.",
    "What chance have I got\n\n\fYou mustnt work yourself up I said.",
    "Why shouldnt it be one of them who killed him Or someone from\noutside Or one of the servants\n\nTheres a certain lack of motive.",
    "Oh motive.",
    "What motive had I got Or Laurence\n\nI felt rather uncomfortable as I said\n\nThey might think I suppose that you and  er  Laurence  are in love\nwith each other  that you wanted to marry.",
    "She sat bolt upright.",
    "Thats a wicked thing to suggest And its not true Weve never said a\nword of that kind to each other.",
    "Ive just been sorry for him and tried to\ncheer him up.",
    "Weve been friends thats all.",
    "You do believe me dont\nyou\n\nI did believe her.",
    "That is I believed that she and Laurence were as she\nput it only friends.",
    "But I also believed that possibly unknown to\nherself she was actually in love with the young man.",
    "It was with that thought in my mind that I went downstairs in search of\nSophia.",
    "As I was about to go into the drawing room Sophia poked her head out\nof a door further along the passage.",
    "Hullo she said Im helping Nannie with lunch.",
    "I would have joined her but she came out into the passage shut the\ndoor behind her and taking my arm led me into the drawing room\nwhich was empty.",
    "Well she said did you see Brenda What did you think of her\n\nFrankly I said I was sorry for her.",
    "Sophia looked amused.",
    "I see she said.",
    "So she got you.",
    "I felt slightly irritated.",
    "The point is I said that I can see her side of it.",
    "Apparently you\ncant.",
    "Her side of what\n\nHonestly Sophia have any of the family ever been nice to her or\neven fairly decent to her since she came here\n\nNo we havent been nice to her.",
    "Why should we be\n\nJust ordinary Christian kindliness if nothing else.",
    "What a very high moral tone youre taking Charles.",
    "Brenda must have\ndone her stuff pretty well.",
    "Really Sophia you seem  I dont know whats come over you.",
    "Im just being honest and not pretending.",
    "Youve seen Brendas side\nof it so you say.",
    "Now take a look at my side.",
    "I dont like the type of\nyoung woman who makes up a hard luck story and marries a very rich\nold man on the strength of it.",
    "Ive a perfect right not to like that type of\nyoung woman and there is no earthly reason why I should pretend I\ndo.",
    "And if the facts were written down in cold blood on paper you\nwouldnt like that young woman either.",
    "Was it a made up story I asked.",
    "About the child I dont know.",
    "Personally I think so.",
    "And you resent the fact that your grandfather was taken in by it\n\nOh grandfather wasnt taken in.",
    "Sophia laughed.",
    "Grandfather was\nnever taken in by anybody.",
    "He wanted Brenda.",
    "He wanted to play\nCophetua to her beggarmaid.",
    "He knew just what he was doing and it\nworked out beautifully according to plan.",
    "From grandfathers point of\nview the marriage was a complete success  like all his other\noperations.",
    "Was engaging Laurence Brown as tutor another of your grandfathers\nsuccesses I asked ironically.",
    "Sophia frowned.",
    "Do you know Im not sure that it wasnt.",
    "He wanted to keep Brenda\nhappy and amused.",
    "He may have thought that jewels and clothes\nwerent enough.",
    "He may have thought she wanted a mild romance in\nher life.",
    "He may have calculated that someone like Laurence Brown\nsomebody really tame if you know what I mean would just do the\ntrick.",
    "A beautiful soulful friendship tinged with melancholy that would\nstop Brenda from having a real affair with someone outside.",
    "I wouldnt\nput it past grandfather to have worked out something on those lines.",
    "He was rather an old devil you know.",
    "He must have been I said.",
    "He couldnt of course have visualised that it would lead to murder...\nAnd that said Sophia speaking with sudden vehemence is really\nwhy I dont much as I would like to really believe that she did it.",
    "If\nshed planned to murder him  or if she and Laurence had planned it\ntogether  grandfather would have known about it.",
    "I daresay that\nseems a bit farfetched to you \n\nI must confess it does I said.",
    "But then you didnt know grandfather.",
    "He certainly wouldnt have\nconnived at his own murder So there you are Up against a blank\nwall.",
    "Shes frightened Sophia I said.",
    "Shes very frightened.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner and his merry merry men Yes I daresay\nthey are rather alarming.",
    "Laurence I suppose is in hysterics\n\n\fPractically.",
    "He made I thought a disgusting exhibition of himself.",
    "I\ndont understand what a woman can see in a man like that.",
    "Dont you Charles Actually Laurence has a lot of sex appeal.",
    "A weakling like that I said incredulously.",
    "Why do men always think that a caveman must necessarily be the\nonly type of person attractive to the opposite sex Laurence has got\nsex appeal all right  but I wouldnt expect you to be aware of it.",
    "She\nlooked at me.",
    "Brenda got her hooks into you all right.",
    "Dont be absurd.",
    "Shes not even really good looking.",
    "And she certainly\ndidnt \n\nDisplay allure No she just made you sorry for her.",
    "Shes not actually\nbeautiful shes not in the least clever  but shes got one very\noutstanding characteristic.",
    "She can make trouble.",
    "Shes made trouble\nalready between you and me.",
    "Sophia I cried aghast.",
    "Sophia went to the door.",
    "Forget it Charles.",
    "I must get on with lunch.",
    "Ill come and help.",
    "No you stay here.",
    "It will rattle Nannie to have a gentleman in the\nkitchen.",
    "Sophia I called as she went out.",
    "Yes what is it\n\nJust a servant problem.",
    "Why havent you got any servants down here\nand upstairs something in an apron and a cap opened the door to us\n\nGrandfather had a cook housemaid parlourmaid and valetattendant.",
    "He liked servants.",
    "He paid them the earth of course and he\ngot them.",
    "Clemency and Roger just have a daily woman who comes in\nand cleans.",
    "They dont like servants  or rather Clemency doesnt.",
    "If\nRoger didnt get a square meal in the City every day hed starve.",
    "Clemencys idea of a meal is lettuce tomatoes and raw carrot.",
    "We\nsometimes have servants and then mother throws one of her\ntemperaments and they leave and we have dailies for a bit and then\nstart again.",
    "Were in the daily period.",
    "Nannie is the permanency and\ncopes in emergencies.",
    "Now you know.",
    "Sophia went out.",
    "I sank down in one of the large brocaded chairs and\ngave myself up to speculation.",
    "Upstairs I had seen Brendas side of it.",
    "Here and now I had been shown Sophias side of it.",
    "I realised\ncompletely the justice of Sophias point of view  what might be called\nthe Leonides familys point of view.",
    "They resented a stranger within\nthe gates who had obtained admission by what they regarded as\n\n\fignoble means.",
    "They were entirely within their rights.",
    "As Sophia had\nsaid On paper it wouldnt look well...",
    "But there was the human side of it  the side that I saw and that they\ndidnt.",
    "They were they always had been rich and well established.",
    "They had\nno conception of the temptations of the underdog.",
    "Brenda Leonides\nhad wanted wealth and pretty things and safety  and a home.",
    "She had\nclaimed that in exchange she had made her old husband happy.",
    "I had\nsympathy with her.",
    "Certainly while I was talking with her I had had\nsympathy for her... Had I got as much sympathy now\n\nTwo sides to the question  different angles of vision  which was the\ntrue angle... the true angle...",
    "I had slept very little the night before.",
    "I had been up early to\naccompany Taverner.",
    "Now in the warm flowerscented atmosphere of\nMagda Leonidess drawing room my body relaxed in the cushioned\nembrace of the big chair and my eyelids dropped...",
    "Thinking of Brenda of Sophia of an old mans picture my thoughts\nslid together into a pleasant haze.",
    "I slept...\n\nChapter 10\n\n\fI returned to consciousness so gradually that I didnt at first realise\nthat I had been asleep.",
    "The scent of flowers was in my nose.",
    "In front of\nme a round white blob appeared to float in space.",
    "It was some few\nseconds before I realised that it was a human face I was looking at  a\nface suspended in the air about a foot or two away from me.",
    "As my\nfaculties returned my vision became more precise.",
    "The face still had\nits goblin suggestion  it was round with a bulging brow combed back\nhair and small rather beady black eyes.",
    "But it was definitely attached\nto a body  a small skinny body.",
    "It was regarding me very earnestly.",
    "Hullo it said.",
    "Hullo I replied blinking.",
    "Im Josephine.",
    "I had already deduced that.",
    "Sophias sister Josephine was I judged\nabout eleven or twelve years of age.",
    "She was a fantastically ugly child\nwith a very distinct likeness to her grandfather.",
    "It seemed to me\npossible that she also had his brains.",
    "Youre Sophias young man said Josephine.",
    "I acknowledged the correctness of this remark.",
    "But you came down here with Chief Inspector Taverner.",
    "Why did you\ncome with Chief Inspector Taverner\n\nHes a friend of mine.",
    "Is he I dont like him.",
    "I shant tell him things.",
    "What sort of things\n\nThe things that I know.",
    "I know a lot of things.",
    "I like knowing things.",

    "She was I felt rather a ghoulish child.",
    "She returned to the charge.",
    "The man who came with Chief Inspector Taverner is a detective too\nisnt he In books it says you can always know plain clothes detectives\nby their boots.",
    "But this detective was wearing suede shoes.",
    "The old order changeth I said.",
    "Josephine interpreted this remark according to her own ideas.",
    "Yes she said there will be a lot of changes here now I expect.",
    "We\nshall go and live in a house in London on the embankment.",
    "Mother has\nwanted to for a long time.",
    "Shell be very pleased.",
    "I dont expect father\nwill mind if his books go too.",
    "He couldnt afford it before.",
    "He lost an\nawful lot of money over Jezebel.",
    "Jezebel I queried.",
    "Yes didnt you see it\n\nOh was it a play No I didnt.",
    "Ive been abroad.",
    "It didnt run very long.",
    "Actually it was the most awful flop.",
    "I dont think\nmothers really the type to play Jezebel do you\n\nI balanced my impressions of Magda.",
    "Neither in the peachcoloured\nnegligee nor in the tailored suit had she conveyed any suggestion of\nJezebel but I was willing to believe that there were other Magdas that\nI had not yet seen.",
    "Perhaps not I said cautiously.",
    "Grandfather always said it would be a flop.",
    "He said he wouldnt put up\nany money for one of these historical religious plays.",
    "He said it would\nnever be a box office success.",
    "But mother was frightfully keen.",
    "I didnt\nlike it much myself.",
    "It wasnt really a bit like the story in the Bible.",
    "I\nmean Jezebel wasnt wicked like she is in the Bible.",
    "She was all\npatriotic and really quite nice.",
    "That made it dull.",
    "Still the end was all\n\n\fright.",
    "They threw her out of the window.",
    "Only no dogs came and ate\nher.",
    "I think that was a pity dont you I like the part about the dogs\neating her best.",
    "Mother says you cant have dogs on the stage but I\ndont see why.",
    "You could have performing dogs.",
    "She quoted with gusto And they ate her all but the palms of her\nhands.",
    "Why didnt they eat the palms of her hands\n\nIve really no idea I said.",
    "You wouldnt think would you that dogs were so particular.",
    "Our dogs\narent.",
    "They eat simply anything.",
    "I pondered on this Biblical mystery for some seconds.",
    "Im sorry the play was a flop I said.",
    "Yes.",
    "Mother was terribly upset.",
    "The notices were simply frightful.",
    "When she read them she burst into tears and cried all day and she\nthrew her breakfast tray at Gladys and Gladys gave notice.",
    "It was\nrather fun.",
    "I perceive that you like drama Josephine I said.",
    "They did a post mortem on grandfather said Josephine.",
    "To find out\nwhat he had died of.",
    "A P.M. they call it but I think thats rather\nconfusing dont you Because P.M. stands for Prime Minister too.",
    "And\nfor afternoon she added thoughtfully.",
    "Are you sorry your grandfather is dead I asked.",
    "Not particularly.",
    "I didnt like him much.",
    "He stopped me learning to be\na ballet dancer.",
    "Did you want to learn ballet dancing\n\nYes and mother was willing for me to learn and father didnt mind\nbut grandfather said Id be no good.",
    "She slipped off the arm of the chair kicked off her shoes and\nendeavoured to get onto what are called technically I believe her\npoints.",
    "You have to have the proper shoes of course she explained and\neven then you get frightful abscesses sometimes on the ends of your\ntoes.",
    "She resumed her shoes and inquired casually Do you like this\nhouse\n\nIm not quite sure I said.",
    "I suppose it will be sold now.",
    "Unless Brenda goes on living in it.",
    "And I\nsuppose Uncle Roger and Aunt Clemency wont be going away now.",
    "Were they going away I asked with a faint stirring of interest.",
    "Yes.",
    "They were going on Tuesday.",
    "Abroad somewhere.",
    "They were\ngoing by air.",
    "Aunt Clemency bought one of those new featherweight\ncases.",

    "They werent\ngoing to tell anyone until after theyd gone.",
    "They were going to leave a\nnote behind for grandfather.",
    "She added\n\nNot pinned to the pincushion.",
    "Thats only in very oldfashioned books\nand wives do it when they leave their husbands.",
    "But it would be silly\nnow because nobody has pincushions any more.",
    "Of course they dont.",
    "Josephine do you know why your Uncle Roger\nwas  going away\n\nShe shot me a cunning sideways glance.",
    "I think I do.",
    "It was something\nto do with Uncle Rogers office in London.",
    "I rather think  but Im not\nsure  that hed embezzled something.",
    "What makes you think that\n\nJosephine came nearer and breathed heavily in my face.",
    "The day that grandfather was poisoned Uncle Roger was shut up in\nhis room with him ever so long.",
    "They were talking and talking.",
    "And\nUncle Roger was saying that hed never been any good and that hed\nlet grandfather down  and that it wasnt the money so much  it was\nthe feeling hed been unworthy of trust.",
    "He was in an awful state.",
    "I looked at Josephine with mixed feelings.",
    "Josephine I said hasnt anybody ever told you that its not nice to\nlisten at doors\n\nJosephine nodded her head vigorously.",
    "Of course they have.",
    "But if you want to find things out you have to\nlisten at doors.",
    "I bet Chief Inspector Taverner does dont you\n\nI considered the point.",
    "Josephine went on vehemently\n\nAnd anyway if he doesnt the other one does the one with the suede\nshoes.",
    "And they look in peoples desks and read all their letters and\nfind out all their secrets.",
    "Only theyre stupid They dont know where to\nlook\n\nJosephine spoke with cold superiority.",
    "I was stupid enough to let the\ninference escape me.",
    "The unpleasant child went on\n\nEustace and I know lots of things  but I know more than Eustace\ndoes.",
    "And I shant tell him.",
    "He says women cant ever be great\ndetectives.",
    "But I say they can.",
    "Im going to write down everything in a\nnotebook and then when the police are completely baffled I shall\ncome forward and say I can tell you who did it.",
    "Do you read a lot of detective stories Josephine\n\nMasses.",
    "I suppose you think you know who killed your grandfather\n\n\fWell I think so  but I shall have to find a few more clues.",
    "She paused\nand added Chief Inspector Taverner thinks that Brenda did it doesnt\nhe Or Brenda and Laurence together because theyre in love with\neach other.",
    "You shouldnt say things like that Josephine.",
    "Why not They are in love with each other.",
    "You cant possibly judge.",
    "Yes I can.",
    "They write to each other.",
    "Love letters.",
    "Josephine How do you know that\n\nBecause Ive read them.",
    "Awfully soppy letters.",
    "But Laurence is soppy.",
    "He was too frightened to fight in the war.",
    "He went into basements and\nstoked boilers.",
    "When the flying bombs went over here he used to turn\ngreen  really green.",
    "It made Eustace and me laugh a lot.",
    "What I would have said next I do not know for at that moment a car\ndrew up outside.",
    "In a flash Josephine was at the window her snub\nnose pressed to the pane.",
    "Who is it I asked.",
    "Its Mr Gaitskill grandfathers lawyer.",
    "I expect hes come about the\nwill.",
    "Breathing excitedly she hurried from the room doubtless to resume\nher sleuthing activities.",
    "Magda Leonides came in the room and to my surprise came across to\nme and took my hands in hers.",
    "My dear she said thank goodness youre still here.",
    "One needs a\nman so badly.",
    "She dropped my hands crossed to a highbacked chair altered its\nposition a little glanced at herself in a mirror then picking up a small\nBattersea enamel box from a table she stood pensively opening and\nshutting it.",
    "It was an attractive pose.",
    "Sophia put her head in at the door and said in an admonitory whisper\nGaitskill\n\nI know said Magda.",
    "A few moments later Sophia entered the room accompanied by a\nsmall elderly man and Magda put down her enamel box and came\nforward to meet him.",
    "Good morning Mrs Philip.",
    "Im on my way upstairs.",
    "It seems theres\nsome misunderstanding about the will.",
    "Your husband wrote to me with\nthe impression that the will was in my keeping.",
    "I understood from Mr\nLeonides himself that it was at his vault.",
    "You dont know anything\nabout it I suppose\n\n\fAbout poor Sweeties will Magda opened astonished eyes.",
    "No of\ncourse not.",
    "Dont tell me that wicked woman upstairs has destroyed\nit\n\nNow Mrs Philip he shook an admonitory finger at her.",
    "No wild\nsurmises.",
    "Its just a question of where your fatherinlaw kept it.",
    "But he sent it to you  surely he did  after signing it.",
    "He actually told\nus he had.",
    "The police I understand have been through Mr Leonidess private\npapers said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "Ill just have a word with Chief Inspector\nTaverner.",
    "He left the room.",
    "Darling cried Magda.",
    "She has destroyed it.",
    "I know Im right.",
    "Nonsense mother she wouldnt do a stupid thing like that.",
    "It wouldnt be stupid at all.",
    "If theres no will shell get everything.",
    "Sh  heres Gaitskill back again.",
    "The lawyer reentered the room.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner was with\nhim and behind Taverner came Philip.",
    "I understood from Mr Leonides Gaitskill was saying that he had\nplaced his will with the Bank for safe keeping.",
    "Taverner shook his head.",
    "Ive been in communication with the Bank.",
    "They have no private\npapers belonging to Mr Leonides beyond certain securities which they\nheld for him.",
    "Philip said\n\nI wonder if Roger  or Aunt Edith  Perhaps Sophia youd ask them to\ncome down here.",
    "But Roger Leonides summoned with the others to the conclave could\ngive no assistance.",
    "But its nonsense  absolute nonsense he declared.",
    "Father signed\nthe will and said distinctly that he was posting it to Mr Gaitskill on the\nfollowing day.",
    "If my memory serves me said Mr Gaitskill leaning back and halfclosing his eyes it was on November 24th of last year that I\nforwarded a draft drawn up according to Mr Leonidess instructions.",
    "He approved the draft returned it to me and in due course I sent him\nthe will for signature.",
    "After a lapse of a week I ventured to remind him\nthat I had not yet received the will duly signed and attested and asking\nhim if there was anything he wished altered.",
    "He replied that he was\nperfectly satisfied and added that after signing the will he had sent it to\nhis Bank.",
    "Thats quite right said Roger eagerly.",
    "It was about the end of\nNovember last year  you remember Philip  Father had us all up one\nevening and read the will to us.",
    "Taverner turned towards Philip Leonides.",
    "That agrees with your recollection Mr Leonides\n\nYes said Philip.",
    "It was rather like the Voysey Inheritance said Magda.",
    "She sighed\npleasurably.",
    "I always think theres something so dramatic about a will.",
    "Miss Sophia\n\nYes said Sophia.",
    "I remember perfectly.",
    "And the provisions of that will asked Taverner.",
    "Mr Gaitskill was about to reply in his precise fashion but Roger\nLeonides got ahead of him.",
    "It was a perfectly simple will.",
    "Electra and Joyce had died and their\nshare of the settlements had returned to father.",
    "Joyces son William\nhad been killed in action in Burma and the money he left went to his\nfather.",
    "Philip and I and the children were the only relatives left.",
    "Father\nexplained that.",
    "He left fifty thousand pounds free of duty to Aunt Edith\na hundred thousand pounds free of duty to Brenda this house to\n\n\fBrenda or else a suitable house in London to be purchased for her\nwhichever she preferred.",
    "The residue to be divided into three portions\none to myself one to Philip the third to be divided between Sophia\nEustace and Josephine the portions of the last two to be held in trust\nuntil they should come of age.",
    "I think thats right isnt it Mr Gaitskill\n\nThose are  roughly stated  the provisions of the document I drew\nup agreed Mr Gaitskill displaying some slight acerbity at not having\nbeen allowed to speak for himself.",
    "Father read it out to us said Roger.",
    "He asked if there was any\ncomment we might like to make.",
    "Of course there was none.",
    "Brenda made a comment said Miss de Haviland.",
    "Yes said Magda with zest.",
    "She said she couldnt bear her darling\nold Aristide to talk about death.",
    "It gave her the creeps she said.",
    "And\nafter he was dead she didnt want any of the horrid money\n\nThat said Miss de Haviland was a conventional protest typical of\nher class.",
    "It was a cruel and biting little remark.",
    "I realised suddenly how much\nEdith de Haviland disliked Brenda.",
    "A very fair and reasonable disposal of his estate said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "And after reading it what happened asked Inspector Taverner.",
    "After reading it said Roger he signed it.",
    "Taverner leaned forward.",
    "Just how and when did he sign it\n\nRoger looked round at his wife in an appealing way.",
    "Clemency spoke in\nanswer to that look.",
    "The rest of the family seemed content for her to do\nso.",
    "You want to know exactly what took place\n\nIf you please Mrs Roger.",
    "My fatherinlaw laid the will down on his desk and requested one of\nus  Roger I think  to ring the bell.",
    "Roger did so.",
    "When Johnson came\nin answer to the bell my fatherinlaw requested him to fetch Janet\nWoolmer the parlourmaid.",
    "When they were both there he signed the\nwill and requested them to sign their own names beneath his\nsignature.",
    "The correct procedure said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "A will must be signed by\nthe testator in the presence of two witnesses who must affix their own\nsignatures at the same time and place.",
    "And after that asked Taverner.",
    "My fatherinlaw thanked them and they went out.",
    "My fatherinlaw\npicked up the will put it in a long envelope and mentioned that he\nwould send it to Mr Gaitskill on the following day.",
    "You all agree said Inspector Taverner looking round that this is an\naccurate account of what happened\n\nThere were murmurs of agreement.",
    "The will was on the desk you said.",
    "How near were any of you to that\ndesk\n\nNot very near.",
    "Five or six yards perhaps would be the nearest.",
    "When Mr Leonides read you the will was he himself sitting at the\ndesk\n\nYes.",
    "Did he get up or leave the desk after reading the will and before\nsigning it\n\nNo.",
    "Could the servants read the document when they signed their\nnames\n\nNo said Clemency.",
    "My fatherinlaw placed a sheet of paper across\nthe upper part of the document.",
    "Quite properly said Philip.",
    "The contents of the will were no\nbusiness of the servants.",
    "I see said Taverner.",
    "At least  I dont see.",
    "With a brisk movement he produced a long envelope and leaned\nforward to hand it to the lawyer.",
    "Have a look at that he said.",
    "And tell me what it is.",
    "Mr Gaitskill drew a folded document out of the envelope.",
    "He looked at\nit with lively astonishment turning it round and round in his hands.",
    "This he said is somewhat surprising.",
    "I do not understand it at all.",
    "Where was this if I may ask\n\nIn the safe amongst Mr Leonidess other papers.",
    "But what is it demanded Roger.",
    "Whats all the fuss about\n\nThis is the will I prepared for your fathers signature Roger  but  I\ncant understand it after what you have all said  it is not signed.",
    "What Well I suppose it is just a draft.",
    "No said the lawyer.",
    "Mr Leonides returned me the original draft.",
    "I\nthen drew up the will  this will he tapped it with his finger and sent\nit to him for signature.",
    "According to your evidence he signed the will in front of you all  and\nthe two witnesses also appended their signatures  and yet this will is\nunsigned.",
    "But thats impossible exclaimed Philip Leonides speaking with more\nanimation than I had yet heard from him.",
    "Taverner asked How good was your fathers eyesight\n\nHe suffered from glaucoma.",
    "He used strong glasses of course for\nreading.",
    "He had those glasses on that evening\n\nCertainly.",
    "He didnt take his glasses off until after he had signed.",
    "I\nthink I am right\n\nQuite right said Clemency.",
    "And nobody  you are all sure of that  went near the desk before the\nsigning of the will\n\nI wonder now said Magda screwing up her eyes.",
    "If one could only\nvisualise it all again.",
    "Nobody went near the desk said Sophia.",
    "And grandfather sat at it\nall the time.",
    "The desk was in the position it is now It was not near a door or a\nwindow or any drapery\n\nIt was where it is now.",
    "I am trying to see how a substitution of some kind could have been\neffected said Taverner.",
    "Some kind of substitution there must have\nbeen.",
    "Mr Leonides was under the impression that he was signing the\ndocument he had just read aloud.",
    "Couldnt the signatures have been erased Roger demanded.",
    "No Mr Leonides.",
    "Not without leaving signs of erasion.",
    "There is one\nother possibility.",
    "That this is not the document sent to Mr Leonides by\nGaitskill and which he signed in your presence.",
    "On the contrary said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "I could swear to this being the\noriginal document.",
    "There is a small flaw in the paper  at the top left\nhand corner  it resembles by a stretch of fancy an aeroplane.",
    "I\nnoticed it at the time.",
    "The family looked blankly at one another.",
    "A most curious set of circumstances said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "Quite\nwithout precedent in my experience.",
    "The whole things impossible said Roger.",
    "We were all there.",
    "It\nsimply couldnt have happened.",
    "Miss de Haviland gave a dry cough.",
    "Never any good wasting breath\nsaying something that has happened couldnt have happened she\nremarked.",
    "Whats the position now Thats what Id like to know\n\nGaitskill immediately became the cautious lawyer.",
    "The position will have to be examined very carefully he said.",
    "The\ndocument of course revokes all former wills and testaments.",
    "There\nare a large number of witnesses who saw Mr Leonides sign what he\ncertainly believed to be this will in perfectly good faith.",
    "Hum.",
    "Very\ninteresting.",
    "Quite a little legal problem.",
    "Taverner glanced at his watch.",
    "Im afraid he said Ive been keeping you from your lunch.",
    "Wont you stay and lunch with us.",
    "Chief Inspector asked Philip.",
    "Thank you Mr Leonides but I am meeting Dr Cray in Swinly Dean.",
    "Philip turned to the lawyer.",
    "Youll lunch with us Gaitskill\n\nThank you Philip.",
    "Everybody stood up.",
    "I edged unobtrusively towards Sophia.",
    "Do I go or stay I murmured.",
    "It sounded ridiculously like the title of a\nVictorian song.",
    "Go I think said Sophia.",
    "I slipped quietly out of the room in pursuit of Taverner.",
    "Josephine was\nswinging to and fro on a baize door leading to the back quarters.",
    "She\nappeared to be highly amused about something.",
    "The police are stupid she observed.",
    "Sophia came out of the drawing room.",
    "What have you been doing Josephine\n\nHelping Nannie.",
    "I believe youve been listening outside the door.",
    "Josephine made a face at her and retreated.",
    "That child said Sophia is a bit of a problem.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nWhen I entered the room Taverner was just saying\n\nAnd here we are.",
    "I talked to them all and what did I get...",
    "Absolutely\nnothing No motive.",
    "None of them needs money.",
    "And the only thing we\ngot against the woman and the guy is that they exchanged glances\nwhen the coffee was poured.",
    "Come on Taverner I said.",
    "I think I got a little more.",
    "Did you indeed Very well Mr Charles what did you get\n\n\fI sat down lighted a cigarette and observed the audience.",
    "Roger Leonides and his wife were planning to go abroad on next\nTuesday.",
    "Roger and his father had a tense interview on the day the old\nman died.",
    "The old Leonides had found out something wrong and Roger\nwas pleading guilty.",
    "Taverners face went purple.",
    "How the hell did you get hold of this he asked.",
    "If it was from the\nservants...\n\nNot from the servants.",
    "I got it  I paused  from a private agent.",
    "What do you mean\n\nI must admit that according to the rules of detective fiction he or she\nleft the police far behind I went on.",
    "And I also think that my private\ninvestigator still has some tricks up the sleeve.",
    "Roger said Taverner.",
    "So Roger  is a scoundrel\n\nI felt quite reluctant to tell all this because I had liked Roger Leonides.",
    "And it was also possible that Josephines informations werent\ntrustworthy.",
    "So the kid told you said Taverner.",
    "She seems to be wise to everything that goes on in that house.",
    "Children usually are said my father drily.",
    "This information if true altered the whole position.",
    "If Roger had been\nas Josephine had confidently suggested embezzling the funds of\nAssociated Catering and if the old man had found it out it might have\nbeen vital to silence old Leonides and to leave England before the truth\ncame out.",
    "Possibly Roger had rendered himself liable to criminal\nprosecution.",
    "It was agreed that inquiries should be made without delay into the\naffairs of Associated Catering.",
    "It will be an almighty crash if that goes my father remarked.",
    "Its a\nhuge concern.",
    "There are millions involved.",
    "If its really in Queer Street it gives us what we want said Taverner.",
    "Father summons Roger.",
    "Roger breaks down and confesses.",
    "Brenda\nLeonides was out at a cinema.",
    "Roger has only got to leave his fathers\nroom walk into the bathroom empty out an insulin phial and replace it\nwith the strong solution of eserine and there you are.",
    "Or his wife may\nhave done it.",
    "She went over to the other wing after she came home\nthat day  says she went over to fetch a pipe Roger had left there.",
    "But\nshe could have gone over to switch the stuff before Brenda came\nhome and gave him his injection.",
    "Shed be quite cool and capable\nabout it.",
    "I nodded.",
    "Yes I fancy her as the actual doer of the deed.",
    "Shes cool\nenough for anything And I dont think that Roger Leonides would think\nof poison as a means  that trick with the insulin has something\nfeminine about it.",
    "Plenty of men poisoners said my father drily.",
    "Oh I know sir said Taverner.",
    "Dont I know he added with feeling.",
    "All the same I shouldnt have said Roger was the type.",
    "Pritchard the Old Man reminded him was a good mixer.",
    "Lets say they were in it together.",
    "With the accent on Lady Macbeth said my father as Taverner\ndeparted.",
    "Is that how she strikes you Charles\n\nI visualised the slight graceful figure standing by the window in that\naustere room.",
    "Not quite I said.",
    "Lady Macbeth was essentially a greedy woman.",
    "I\ndont think Clemency Leonides is.",
    "I dont think she wants or cares for\npossessions.",
    "But she might care desperately about her husbands safety\n\nThat yes.",
    "And she could certainly be  well ruthless.",
    "Different kinds of ruthlessness...\n\nThat was what Sophia had said.",
    "I looked up to see the Old Man watching me.",
    "Whats on your mind Charles\n\nBut I didnt tell him then.",
    "I was summoned on the following day and found Taverner and my\nfather together.",
    "Taverner was looking pleased with himself and slightly\nexcited.",
    "Associated Catering is on the rocks said my father.",
    "Due to crash at any minute said Taverner.",
    "I saw there had been a sharp fall in the shares last night I said.",
    "But\nthey seem to have recovered this morning.",
    "Weve had to go about it very cautiously said Taverner.",
    "No direct\ninquiries.",
    "Nothing to cause a panic  or to put the wind up our\nabsconding gentleman.",
    "But weve got certain private sources of\ninformation and the information there is fairly definite.",
    "Associated\nCatering is on the verge of a crash.",
    "It cant possibly meet its\ncommitments.",
    "The truth seems to be that its been grossly\nmismanaged for years.",
    "By Roger Leonides\n\nYes.",
    "Hes had supreme power you know.",
    "And hes helped himself to money \n\n\fNo said Taverner.",
    "We dont think he has.",
    "To put it bluntly he may\nbe a murderer but we dont think hes a swindler.",
    "Quite frankly hes\njust been  a fool.",
    "He doesnt seem to have had any kind of judgement.",
    "Hes launched out where he should have held in  hes hesitated and\nretreated where he ought to have launched out.",
    "Hes delegated power\nto the last sort of people he ought to have delegated it to.",
    "Hes a\ntrustful sort of chap and hes trusted the wrong people.",
    "At every time\nand on every occasion hes done the wrong thing.",
    "There are people like that said my father.",
    "And theyre not really\nstupid either.",
    "Theyre bad judges of men thats all.",
    "And theyre\nenthusiastic at the wrong time.",
    "A man like that oughtnt to be in business at all said Taverner.",
    "He probably wouldnt be said my father except for the accident of\nbeing Aristide Leonidess son.",
    "That show was absolutely booming when the old man handed it over\nto him.",
    "It ought to have been a gold mine Youd think he could have\njust sat back and let the show run itself.",
    "No my father shook his head.",
    "No show runs itself.",
    "There are always\ndecisions to be made  a man sacked here  a man appointed there small questions of policy.",
    "And with Roger Leonides the answer seems\nto have been always wrong.",
    "Thats right said Taverner.",
    "Hes a loyal sort of chap for one thing.",
    "He kept on the most frightful duds  just because he had an affection\nfor them  or because theyd been there a long time.",
    "And then he\n\n\fsometimes had wild impractical ideas and insisted on trying them out\nin spite of the enormous outlay involved.",
    "But nothing criminal my father insisted.",
    "No nothing criminal.",
    "Then why murder I asked.",
    "He may have been a fool and not a knave said Taverner.",
    "But the\nresult was the same  or nearly the same.",
    "The only thing that could\nsave Associated Catering from the smash was a really colossal sum of\nmoney by next  he consulted a notebook by next Wednesday at the\nlatest.",
    "Such a sum as he would inherit or thought he would have inherited\nunder his fathers will\n\nExactly.",
    "But he wouldnt be able to have got that sum in cash.",
    "No.",
    "But hed have got credit.",
    "Its the same thing.",
    "The Old Man nodded.",
    "Wouldnt it have been simpler to go to old Leonides and ask for help\nhe suggested.",
    "I think he did said Taverner.",
    "I think thats what the kid overheard.",
    "The old boy refused point blank I should imagine to throw good\nmoney after bad.",
    "He would you know.",
    "I thought that Taverner was right there.",
    "Aristide Leonides had refused\nthe backing for Magdas play  he had said that it would not be a Box\nOffice success.",
    "Events had proved him correct.",
    "He was a generous\nman to his family but he was not a man to waste money in unprofitable\nenterprises.",
    "And Associated Catering ran to thousands or probably hundreds of\nthousands.",
    "He had refused point blank and the only way for Roger to\navoid financial ruin was for his father to die.",
    "Yes there was certainly a motive there all right.",
    "My father looked at his watch.",
    "Ive asked him to come here he said.",
    "Hell be here any minute now.",
    "Roger\n\nYes.",
    "Will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly I murmured.",
    "Taverner looked at me in a shocked way.",
    "We shall give him all the proper cautions he said severely.",
    "The stage was set the shorthand writer established.",
    "Presently the\nbuzzer sounded and a few minutes later Roger Leonides entered the\nroom.",
    "He came in eagerly  and rather clumsily  he stumbled over a chair.",
    "I\nwas reminded as before of a large friendly dog.",
    "At the same time I\ndecided quite definitely that it was not he who had carried out the\nactual process of transferring eserine to an insulin bottle.",
    "He would\nhave broken it spilled it or muffed the operation in some way or other.",
    "No.",
    "Clemencys I decided had been the actual hand though Roger\nhad been privy to the deed.",
    "Words rushed from him\n\nYou wanted to see me Youve found out something Hullo Charles I\ndidnt see you.",
    "Nice of you to come along.",
    "But please tell me.",
    "Sir Arthur\n\n\nSuch a nice fellow  really such a nice fellow.",
    "But lots of murderers had\nbeen nice fellows  so their astonished friends had said afterwards.",
    "Feeling rather like Judas I smiled a greeting.",
    "My father was deliberate coldly official.",
    "The glib phrases were\nuttered.",
    "Statement... taken down... no compulsion... solicitor...\n\nRoger Leonides brushed them all aside with the same characteristic\neager impatience.",
    "I saw the faint sardonic smile on Chief Inspector Taverners face and\nread from it the thought in his mind.",
    "Always sure of themselves these chaps.",
    "They cant make a mistake.",
    "Theyre far too clever\n\nI sat down unobtrusively in a corner and listened.",
    "I have asked you to come here Mr Leonides my father said not to\ngive you fresh information but to ask for some information from you information that you have previously withheld.",
    "Roger Leonides looked bewildered.",
    "Withheld But Ive told you everything  absolutely everything\n\nI think not.",
    "You had a conversation with the deceased on the\nafternoon of his death\n\nYes yes I had tea with him.",
    "I told you so.",
    "You told us that yes but you did not tell us about your conversation.",
    "We  just  talked.",
    "What about\n\nDaily happenings the house Sophia \n\nWhat about Associated Catering Was that mentioned\n\n\fI think I had hoped up to then that Josephine had been inventing the\nwhole story  but if so that hope was quickly quenched.",
    "Rogers face changed.",
    "It changed in a moment from eagerness to\nsomething that was recognisably close to despair.",
    "Oh my God he said.",
    "He dropped into a chair and buried his face in\nhis hands.",
    "Taverner smiled like a contented cat.",
    "You admit Mr Leonides that you have not been frank with us\n\nHow did you get to know about that I thought nobody knew  I dont\nsee how anybody could know.",
    "We have means of finding out these things Mr Leonides.",
    "There was\na majestic pause.",
    "I think you will see now that you had better tell us\nthe truth.",
    "Yes yes of course.",
    "Ill tell you.",
    "What do you want to know\n\nIs it true that Associated Catering is on the verge of collapse\n\nYes.",
    "It cant be staved off now.",
    "The crash is bound to come.",
    "If only my\nfather could have died without ever knowing.",
    "I feel so ashamed  so\ndisgraced \n\nThere is a possibility of criminal prosecution\n\n\fRoger sat up sharply.",
    "No indeed.",
    "It will be bankruptcy  but an honourable bankruptcy.",
    "Creditors will be paid twenty shillings in the pound if I throw in my\npersonal assets which I shall do.",
    "No the disgrace I feel is to have\nfailed my father.",
    "He trusted me.",
    "He made over to me this his largest\nconcern  and his pet concern.",
    "He never interfered he never asked\nwhat I was doing.",
    "He just  trusted me... And I let him down.",
    "My father said drily\n\nYou say there was no likelihood of criminal prosecution Why then\nhad you and your wife planned to go abroad without telling anybody of\nyour intention\n\nYou know that too\n\nYes Mr Leonides.",
    "But dont you see He leaned forward eagerly.",
    "I couldnt face him\nwith the truth.",
    "It would have looked you see as if I was asking for\nmoney As though I wanted him to set me on my feet again.",
    "He  he\nwas very fond of me.",
    "He would have wanted to help.",
    "But I couldnt  I\ncouldnt go on  it would have meant making a mess of things all over\nagain  Im no good.",
    "I havent got the ability.",
    "Im not the man my father\nwas.",
    "Ive always known it.",
    "Ive tried.",
    "But its no good.",
    "Ive been so\nmiserable  God you dont know how miserable Ive been Trying to get\nout of the muddle hoping Id just get square hoping the dear old man\nwould never need hear about it.",
    "And then it came  no more hope of\navoiding the crash.",
    "Clemency  my wife  she understood she agreed\n\n\fwith me.",
    "We thought out this plan.",
    "Say nothing to anyone.",
    "Go away.",
    "And then let the storm break.",
    "Id leave a letter for my father telling him\nall about it  telling him how ashamed I was and begging him to forgive\nme.",
    "Hes been so good to me always  you dont know But it would be\ntoo late then for him to do anything.",
    "Thats what I wanted.",
    "Not to ask\nhim  or even to seem to ask him for help.",
    "Start again on my own\nsomewhere.",
    "Live simply and humbly.",
    "Grow things.",
    "Coffee  fruit.",
    "Just\nhave the bare necessities of life  hard on Clemency but she swore she\ndidnt mind.",
    "Shes wonderful  absolutely wonderful.",
    "I see.",
    "My fathers voice was dry.",
    "And what made you change your\nmind\n\nChange my mind\n\nYes.",
    "What made you decide to go to your father and ask for financial\nhelp after all\n\nRoger stared at him.",
    "But I didnt\n\nCome now Mr Leonides.",
    "Youve got it all wrong.",
    "I didnt go to him.",
    "He sent for me.",
    "Hed heard\nsomehow in the City.",
    "A rumour I suppose.",
    "But he always knew\nthings.",
    "Someone had told him.",
    "He tackled me with it.",
    "Then of course I\nbroke down...",
    "I told him everything.",
    "I said it wasnt so much the money\n it was the feeling Id let him down after hed trusted me.",
    "Roger swallowed convulsively.",
    "The dear man he said.",
    "You cant\nimagine how he was to me.",
    "No reproaches.",
    "Just kindness.",
    "I told him I\ndidnt want help that I preferred not to have it  that Id rather go away\nas I had planned to do.",
    "But he wouldnt listen.",
    "He insisted on coming to\nthe rescue  on putting Associated Catering on its legs again.",
    "Taverner said sharply\n\nYou are expecting us to believe that your father intended to come to\nyour assistance financially\n\nCertainly he did.",
    "He wrote to his brokers then and there giving them\ninstructions.",
    "I suppose he saw the incredulity on the two mens faces and flushed.",
    "Look here he said Ive still got the letter.",
    "I was to post it.",
    "But of\ncourse later  with  with the shock and confusion I forgot.",
    "Ive\nprobably got it in my pocket now.",
    "He drew out his wallet and started hunting through it.",
    "Finally he found\nwhat he wanted.",
    "It was a creased envelope with a stamp on it.",
    "It was\nadressed as I saw by leaning forward to Messrs. Greatorex and\nHanbury.",
    "Read it for yourselves he said.",
    "If you dont believe me.",
    "My father tore open the letter.",
    "Taverner went round behind him.",
    "I did\nnot see the letter then but I saw it later.",
    "It instructed Messrs.\nGreatorex and Hanbury to realise certain investments and asked for a\n\n\fmember of the firm to be sent down on the following day to take\ncertain instructions re the affairs of Associated Catering.",
    "Some of it\nwas unintelligible to me but its purport was clear enough.",
    "Aristide\nLeonides was preparing to put Associated Catering on its feet again.",
    "Taverner said\n\nWe will give you a receipt for this Mr Leonides.",
    "Roger took the receipt.",
    "He got up and said\n\nIs that all You do see how it all was dont you\n\nTaverner said\n\nMr Leonides gave you this letter and you then left him What did you\ndo next\n\nI rushed back to my own part of the house.",
    "My wife had just come in.",
    "I\ntold her what my father proposed to do.",
    "How wonderful he had been I\n really I hardly knew what I was doing.",
    "And your father was taken ill  how long after that\n\nLet me see  half an hour perhaps or an hour.",
    "Brenda came rushing\nin.",
    "She was frightened.",
    "She said he looked queer.",
    "I  I rushed over with\nher.",
    "But Ive told you this before.",
    "During your former visit did you go into the bathroom adjoining your\nfathers room at all\n\n\fI dont think so.",
    "No  no I am sure I didnt.",
    "Why you cant possibly\nthink that I \n\nMy father quelled the sudden indignation.",
    "He got up and shook hands.",
    "Thank you Mr Leonides he said.",
    "You have been very helpful.",
    "But\nyou should have told us all this before.",
    "The door closed behind Roger.",
    "I got up and came to look at the letter\nlying on my fathers table.",
    "It could be forgery said Taverner hopefully.",
    "It could be said my father but I dont think it is.",
    "I think well have to\naccept it as it stands.",
    "Old Leonides was prepared to get his son out of\nthis mess.",
    "It could have been done more efficiently by him alive than it\ncould by Roger after his death... especially as it now transpires that no\nwill is to be found and that in consequence Rogers actual amount of\ninheritance is open to question.",
    "That means delays  and difficulties.",
    "As things now stand the crash is bound to come.",
    "No Taverner Roger\nLeonides and his wife had no motive for getting the old man out of the\nway.",
    "On the contrary \n\nHe stopped and repeated thoughtfully as though a sudden thought had\noccurred to him On the contrary...\n\nWhats on your mind sir Taverner asked.",
    "The Old Man said slowly\n\n\fIf Aristide Leonides had lived only another twentyfour hours Roger\nwould have been all right.",
    "But he didnt live twentyfour hours.",
    "He died\nsuddenly and dramatically within little more than an hour.",
    "Hm said Taverner.",
    "Do you think somebody in the house wanted\nRoger to go broke Someone who had an opposing financial interest\nDoesnt seem likely.",
    "Whats the position as regards the will my father asked.",
    "Who\nactually gets old Leonides money\n\nYou know what lawyers are.",
    "Cant get a straight answer out of them.",
    "Theres a former will.",
    "Made when he married the second Mrs Leonides.",
    "That leaves the same sum to her rather less to Miss de Haviland and\nthe remainder between Philip and Roger.",
    "I should have thought that if\nthis will isnt signed then the old one would operate but it seems it\nisnt so simple as that.",
    "First the making of the new will revoked the\nformer one and there are witnesses to the signing of it and the\ntestators intention.",
    "It seems to be a toss up if it turns out that he died\nintestate.",
    "Then the widow apparently gets the lot  or a life interest at\nany rate.",
    "So if the wills disappeared Brenda Leonides is the most likely person\nto profit by it\n\nYes.",
    "If theres been any hocus pocus it seems probable that shes at\nthe bottom of it.",
    "And there obviously has been hocus pocus but Im\ndashed if I see how it was done.",
    "I didnt see either.",
    "I suppose we were really incredibly stupid.",
    "But we\nwere looking at it of course from the wrong angle.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nThere was a short silence after Taverner had gone out.",
    "Then I said Dad what are murderers like\n\nThe Old Man looked up at me thoughtfully.",
    "We understand each other so well that he knew exactly what was in my\nmind when I put that question.",
    "And he answered it very seriously.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Thats important now  very important for you...",
    "Murders come close to you.",
    "You cant go on looking at it from the\noutside.",
    "I had always been interested in an amateurish kind of way in some of\nthe more spectacular cases with which the CID had dealt but as my\nfather said I had been interested from the outside  looking in as it\nwere through the shop window.",
    "But now as Sophia had seen much\nmore quickly than I did murder had become a dominant factor in my\nlife.",
    "The Old Man went on\n\n\fI dont know if Im the right person to ask.",
    "I could put you on to a\ncouple of the tame psychiatrists who do jobs for us.",
    "Theyve got it all\ncut and dried.",
    "Or Taverner could give you all the inside dope.",
    "But you\nwant I take it to hear what I personally as the result of my\nexperience of criminals think about it\n\nThats what I want I said gratefully.",
    "My father traced a little circle with his finger on the desk top.",
    "What are murderers like Some of them a faint rather melancholy\nsmile showed on his face have been thoroughly nice chaps.",
    "I think I looked a little startled.",
    "Oh yes they have he said.",
    "Nice ordinary fellows like you and me or like that chap who went out just now  Roger Leonides.",
    "Murder you\nsee is an amateur crime.",
    "Im speaking of course of the kind of murder\nyou have in mind  not gangster stuff.",
    "One feels very often as though\nthese nice ordinary chaps had been overtaken as it were by murder\nalmost accidentally.",
    "Theyve been in a tight place or theyve wanted\nsomething very badly money or a woman  and theyve killed to get it.",
    "The brake that operates with most of us doesnt operate with them.",
    "A\nchild you know translates desire into action without compunction.",
    "A\nchild is angry with its kitten says Ill kill you and hits it on the head\nwith a hammer  and then breaks its heart because the kitten doesnt\ncome alive again Lots of kids try to take a baby out of a pram and\ndrown it because it usurps attention  or interferes with their\npleasures.",
    "They get  very early  to a stage when they know that that is\nwrong  that is that it will be punished.",
    "Later they get to feel that it is\n\n\fwrong.",
    "But some people I suspect remain morally immature.",
    "They\ncontinue to be aware that murder is wrong but they do not feel it.",
    "I\ndont think in my experience that any murderer has really felt\nremorse... And that perhaps is the mark of Cain.",
    "Murderers are set\napart they are different  murder is wrong  but not for them  for them\nit is necessary  the victim has asked for it it was the only way.",
    "Do you think I asked that if someone hated old Leonides had\nhated him say for a very long time that that would be a reason\n\nPure hate Very unlikely I should say.",
    "My father looked at me curiously.",
    "When you say hate I presume you\nmean dislike carried to excess.",
    "A jealous hate is different  that rises\nout of affection and frustration.",
    "Constance Kent everybody said was\nvery fond of the baby brother she killed.",
    "But she wanted one\nsupposes the attention and the love that was bestowed on him.",
    "I think\npeople more often kill those they love than those they hate.",
    "Possibly\nbecause only the people you love can really make life unendurable to\nyou.",
    "But all this doesnt help you much does it he went on.",
    "What you\nwant if I read you correctly is some token some universal sign that\nwill help you to pick out a murderer from a household of apparently\nnormal and pleasant people\n\nYes thats it.",
    "Is there a common denominator I wonder.",
    "You know he paused in\nthought if there is I should be inclined to say it is vanity.",
    "Vanity\n\nYes Ive never met a murderer who wasnt vain... Its their vanity that\nleads to their undoing nine times out of ten.",
    "They may be frightened of\nbeing caught but they cant help strutting and boasting and usually\ntheyre sure theyve been far too clever to be caught.",
    "He added And\nheres another thing a murderer wants to talk.",
    "To talk\n\nYes you see having committed a murder puts you in a position of\ngreat loneliness.",
    "Youd like to tell somebody all about it  and you never\ncan.",
    "And that makes you want to all the more.",
    "And so  if you cant talk\nabout how you did it you can at least talk about the murder itself discuss it advance theories  go over it.",
    "If I were you Charles I should look out for that.",
    "Go down there again\nmix with them all get them to talk.",
    "Of course it wont be plain sailing.",
    "Guilty or innocent theyll be glad of the chance to talk to a stranger\nbecause they can say things to you that they couldnt say to each\nother.",
    "But its possible I think that you might spot a difference.",
    "A\nperson who has something to hide cant really afford to talk at all.",

    "He was interested.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Your young woman has got something there.",
    "Most\nfamilies have got a defect a chink in the armour.",
    "Most people can deal\nwith one weakness  but they mightnt be able to deal with two\nweaknesses of a different kind.",
    "Interesting thing heredity.",
    "Take the de\nHaviland ruthlessness and what we might call the Leonidess\nunscrupulousness  the de Havilands are all right because theyre not\nunscrupulous and the Leonides are all right because though\nunscrupulous they are kindly  but get a descendant who inherited\nboth of those traits  see what I mean\n\nI had not thought of it quite in those terms.",
    "My father said\n\nBut I shouldnt worry your head about heredity.",
    "Its much too tricky\nand complicated a subject.",
    "No my boy go down there and let them\ntalk to you.",
    "Your Sophia is quite right about one thing.",

    "No I didnt mean that.",
    "I meant  look after her.",
    "We dont want anything\nto happen to her.",

    "Showing off.",

    "Thatll fetch her.",
    "He added\n\nBut take care of her.",
    "She may know a little too much for somebodys\nsafety.",
    "Chapter 13\n\nI went down to the Crooked House as I called it in my own mind with a\nslightly guilty feeling.",
    "Though I had repeated to Taverner Josephines\nconfidences about Roger I had said nothing about her statement that\nBrenda and Laurence Brown wrote love letters to each other.",
    "I excused myself by pretending that it was mere romancing and that\nthere was no reason to believe that it was true.",
    "But actually I had felt a\nstrange reluctance to pile up additional evidence against Brenda\n\n\fLeonides.",
    "I had been affected by the pathos of her position in the\nhouse  surrounded by a hostile family united solidly against her.",
    "If\nsuch letters existed doubtless Taverner and his myrmidons would find\nthem.",
    "I disliked to be the means of bringing fresh suspicion on a\nwoman in a difficult position.",
    "Moreover she had assured me solemnly\nthat there was nothing of that kind between her and Laurence and I felt\nmore inclined to believe her than to believe that malicious gnome\nJosephine.",
    "Had not Brenda said herself that Josephine was not all\nthere.",
    "I stifled an uneasy certainty that Josephine was very much all there.",
    "I\nremembered the intelligence of her beady black eyes.",
    "I had rung up Sophia and asked if I might come down again.",
    "Please do Charles.",
    "How are things going\n\nI dont know.",
    "All right.",
    "They keep on searching the house.",
    "What are\nthey looking for\n\nIve no idea.",

    "I shall go\ncrazy if I cant talk to someone.",
    "I said I would come down straightaway.",
    "There was no one in sight as I drove up to the front door.",
    "I paid the taxi\nand it drove away.",
    "I felt uncertain whether to ring the bell or to walk in.",
    "The front door was open.",
    "As I stood there hesitating I heard a slight sound behind me.",
    "I turned\nmy head sharply.",
    "Josephine her face partially obscured by a very\nlarge apple was standing in the opening of the yew hedge looking at\nme.",
    "As I turned my head she turned away.",
    "Hullo Josephine.",
    "She did not answer but disappeared behind the hedge.",
    "I crossed the\ndrive and followed her.",
    "She was seated on the uncomfortable rustic\nbench by the goldfish pond swinging her legs to and fro and biting into\nher apple.",
    "Above its rosy circumference her eyes regarded me\nsombrely and with what I could not but feel was hostility.",
    "Ive come down again Josephine I said.",
    "It was a feeble opening but I found Josephines silence and her\nunblinking gaze rather unnerving.",
    "With excellent strategic sense she still did not reply.",
    "Is that a good apple I asked.",
    "This time Josephine did condescend to reply.",
    "Her reply consisted of\none word.",
    "Woolly.",
    "A pity I said.",
    "I dont like woolly apples.",
    "Josephine replied scornfully\n\nNobody does.",
    "Why wouldnt you speak to me when I said hullo\n\nI didnt want to.",
    "Why not\n\nJosephine removed the apple from her face to assist in the clearness\nof her denunciation.",
    "You went and sneaked to the police she said.",
    "Oh I was rather taken aback.",
    "You mean  about \n\nAbout Uncle Roger.",
    "But its all right Josephine I assured her.",
    "Quite all right.",
    "They know\nhe didnt do anything wrong  I mean he hadnt embezzled any money\nor anything of that kind.",
    "Josephine threw me an exasperated glance.",
    "How stupid you are.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "I wasnt worrying about Uncle Roger.",
    "Its simply that thats not the\nway to do detective work.",
    "Dont you know that you never tell the police\nuntil the very end\n\nOh I see I said.",
    "Im sorry Josephine.",
    "Im really very sorry.",
    "So you should be.",
    "She added reproachfully I trusted you.",
    "I said I was sorry for the third time.",
    "Josephine appeared a little mollified.",
    "She took another couple of bites\nof apple.",
    "But the police would have been bound to find out about all this I\nsaid.",
    "You  I  we couldnt have kept it a secret.",
    "You mean because hes going bankrupt\n\nAs usual Josephine was well informed.",
    "I suppose it will come to that.",
    "Theyre going to talk about it tonight said Josephine.",
    "Father and\nMother and Uncle Roger and Aunt Edith.",
    "Aunt Edith would give him her\nmoney  only she hasnt got it yet  but I dont think father will.",
    "He says\nif Roger has got in a jam hes only got himself to blame and whats the\n\n\fgood of throwing good money after bad and mother wont hear of\ngiving him any because she wants father to put up the money for Edith\nThompson.",
    "Do you know Edith Thompson She was married but she\ndidnt like her husband.",
    "She was in love with a young man called\nBywaters who came off a ship and he went down a different street\nafter the theatre and stabbed him in the back.",
    "I marvelled once more at the range and completeness of Josephines\nknowledge and also at the dramatic sense which only slightly\nobscured by hazy pronouns had presented all the salient facts in a\nnutshell.",
    "It sounds all right said Josephine but I dont suppose the play will\nbe like that at all.",
    "It will be like Jezebel again.",
    "She sighed.",
    "I wish I knew why the dogs wouldnt eat the palms of her\nhands.",
    "Josephine I said.",
    "You told me that you were almost sure who the\nmurderer was\n\nWell\n\nWho is it\n\nShe gave me a look of scorn.",
    "I see I said.",
    "Not till the last chapter Not even if I promise not to tell\nInspector Taverner\n\n\fI want just a few more clues said Josephine.",
    "Anyway she added throwing the core of the apple into the goldfish\npool I wouldnt tell you.",
    "If youre anyone youre Watson.",
    "I stomached this insult.",
    "O.K.",
    "I said.",
    "Im Watson.",
    "But even Watson was given the data.",
    "The what\n\nThe facts.",
    "And then he made the wrong deductions from them.",
    "Wouldnt it be a lot of fun for you to see me making the wrong\ndeductions\n\nFor a moment Josephine was tempted.",
    "Then she shook her head.",
    "No she said and added Anyway Im not very keen on Sherlock\nHolmes.",
    "Its awfully old fashioned.",
    "They drive about in dog carts.",
    "What about those letters I asked.",
    "What letters\n\nThe letters you said Laurence Brown and Brenda wrote to each other.",
    "I made that up said Josephine.",
    "I dont believe you.",
    "Yes I did.",
    "I often make things up.",
    "It amuses me.",
    "I stared at her.",
    "She stared back.",
    "Look here Josephine.",
    "I know a man sit the British Museum who\nknows a lot about the Bible.",
    "If I find out from him why the dogs didnt\neat the palms of Jezebels hands Will you tell me about those letters\n\nThis time Josephine really hesitated.",
    "Somewhere not very far away a\ntwig snapped with a sharp cracking noise.",
    "Josephine said flatly\n\nNo I wont.",
    "I accepted defeat.",
    "Rather late in the day I remembered my fathers\nadvice.",
    "Oh well I said its only a game.",
    "Of course you dont really know\nanything.",
    "Josephines eyes snapped but she resisted the bait.",
    "I got up.",
    "I must go in now I said and find Sophia.",
    "Come along.",
    "I shall stop here said Josephine.",
    "No you wont I said.",
    "Youre coming in with me.",
    "Unceremoniously I yanked her to her feet.",
    "She seemed surprised and\ninclined to protest but yielded with a fairly good grace  partly no\ndoubt because she wished to observe the reactions of the household\nto my presence.",
    "Why I was so anxious for her to accompany me I could not at the\nmoment have said.",
    "It only came to me as we were passing through the\nfront door.",
    "It was because of the sudden snapping of a twig.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nThere was a murmur of voices from the big drawing room.",
    "I hesitated\nbut did not go in.",
    "I wandered on down the passage and led by some\nimpulse I pushed open a baize door.",
    "The passage beyond was dark\nbut suddenly a door opened showing a big lighted kitchen.",
    "In the\ndoorway stood an old woman  a rather bulky old woman.",
    "She had a\nvery clean white apron tied round her ample waist and the moment I\nsaw her I knew that everything was all right.",
    "It is the feeling that a good\nNannie can always give you.",
    "I am thirtyfive but I felt just like a\nreassured little boy of four.",
    "As far as I knew Nannie had never seen me but she said at once\n\nIts Mr Charles isnt it Come into the kitchen and let me give you a\ncup of tea.",
    "It was a big happy feeling kitchen.",
    "I sat down by the centre table and\nNannie brought me a cup of tea and two sweet biscuits on a plate.",
    "I felt\nmore than ever that I was in the nursery again.",
    "Everything was all right\n and the terrors of the dark room and the unknown were no more with\nme.",
    "Miss Sophia will be glad youve come said Nannie.",
    "Shes been\ngetting rather overexcited.",
    "She added disapprovingly Theyre all\noverexcited.",
    "I looked over my shoulder.",
    "Wheres Josephine She came in with me.",
    "Nannie made a disapproving clacking noise with her tongue.",
    "Listening at doors and writing down things in that silly little book she\ncarries about with her she said.",
    "She ought to have gone to school\nand had children of her own age to play with.",
    "Ive said so to Miss Edith\nand she agrees  but the master would have it that she was best here in\nher home.",
    "I suppose hes very fond of her I said.",
    "He was sir.",
    "He was fond of them all.",
    "I looked slightly astonished wondering why Philips affection for his\noffspring was put so definitely in the past.",
    "Nannie saw my expression\nand flushing slightly she said\n\n\fWhen I said the master it was old Mr Leonides I meant.",
    "Before I could respond to that the door opened with a rush and Sophia\ncame in.",
    "Oh Charles she said and then quickly Oh Nannie Im so glad hes\ncome.",
    "I know you are love.",
    "Nannie gathered up a lot of pots and pans and went off into a scullery\nwith them.",
    "She shut the door behind her.",
    "I got up from the table and went over to Sophia.",
    "I put my arms round\nher and held her to me.",
    "Dearest I said.",
    "Youre trembling.",
    "What is it\n\nSophia said\n\nIm frightened Charles.",
    "Im frightened.",
    "I love you I said.",
    "If I could take you away \n\nShe drew apart and shook her head.",
    "No thats impossible.",
    "Weve got to see this through.",
    "But you know\nCharles I dont like it.",
    "I dont like the feeling that someone  someone in\n\n\fthis house  someone I see and speak to every day is a cold blooded\ncalculating poisoner...\n\nAnd I didnt know how to answer that.",
    "To someone like Sophia one can give no easy meaningless\nreassurances.",
    "She said If only one knew \n\nThat must be the worst of it I agreed.",
    "You know what really frightens me she whispered.",
    "Its that we may\nnever know...",
    "I could visualise easily what a nightmare that would be... And it\nseemed to me highly probable that it never might be known who had\nkilled old Leonides.",
    "But it also reminded me of a question I had meant to put to Sophia on a\npoint that had interested me.",
    "Tell me Sophia I said.",
    "How many people in this house knew about\nthe eserine eyedrops  I mean a that your grandfather had them and\nb that they were poisonous and what would be a fatal dose\n\nI see what youre getting at Charles.",
    "But it wont work.",
    "You see we all\nknew.",
    "Well yes vaguely I suppose but specifically \n\n\fWe knew specifically.",
    "We were all up with grandfather one day for\ncoffee after lunch.",
    "He liked all the family round him you know.",
    "And his\neyes had been giving him a lot of trouble.",
    "And Brenda got the eserine\nto put a drop in each eye and Josephine who always asks questions\nabout everything said Why does it say Eyedrops  not to be taken\non the bottle What would happen if you drank all the bottle And\ngrandfather smiled and said If Brenda were to make a mistake and\ninject eyedrops into me one day instead of insulin  I suspect I should\ngive a big gasp and go rather blue in the face and then die because\nyou see my heart isnt very strong.",
    "And Josephine said Oo and\ngrandfather went on So we must be careful that Brenda does not give\nme an injection of eserine instead of insulin mustnt we\n\nSophia paused and then said We were all there listening.",
    "You see\nWe all heard\n\nI did see.",
    "I had had some faint idea in my mind that just a little\nspecialized knowledge would have been needed.",
    "But now it was borne\nin upon me that old Leonides had actually supplied the blue print for\nhis own murder.",
    "The murderer had not had to think out a scheme or to\nplan or devise anything.",
    "A simple easy method of causing death had\nbeen supplied by the victim himself.",
    "I drew a deep breath.",
    "Sophia catching my thought said Yes its\nrather horrible isnt it\n\nYou know Sophia I said slowly.",
    "Theres just one thing does strike\nme.",
    "Yes\n\nThat youre right and that it couldnt have been Brenda.",
    "She couldnt\ndo it exactly that way  when youd all listened  when youd all\nremember.",
    "I dont know about that.",
    "She is rather dumb in some ways you know.",
    "Not as dumb as all that I said.",
    "No it couldnt have been Brenda.",
    "Sophia moved away from me.",
    "You dont want it to be Brenda do you she asked.",
    "And what could I say I couldnt  no I couldnt  say flatly Yes I hope\nit is Brenda.",
    "Why couldnt I Just the feeling that Brenda was all alone on one side\nand the concentrated animosity of the powerful Leonides family was\narrayed against her on the other side Chivalry A feeling for the\nweaker For the defenceless I remembered her sitting on the sofa in\nher expensive rich mourning the hopelessness in her voice  the fear\nin her eyes.",
    "Nannie came back rather opportunely from the scullery.",
    "I dont know\nwhether she sensed a certain strain between myself and Sophia.",
    "She said disapprovingly\n\n\fTalking murders and such like.",
    "Forget about it thats what I say.",
    "Leave it to the police.",
    "Its their nasty business not yours.",
    "Oh Nannie  dont you realize that someone in this house is a\nmurderer.",
    "Nonsense Miss Sophia Ive no patience with you.",
    "Isnt the front door\nopen all the time  all the doors open nothing locked  asking for\nthieves and burglars.",
    "But it couldnt have been a burglar nothing was stolen.",
    "Besides why\nshould a burglar come in and poison somebody\n\nI didnt say it was a burglar.",
    "Miss Sophia.",
    "I only said all the doors were\nopen.",
    "Anyone could have got in.",
    "If you ask me it was the Communists.",
    "Nannie nodded her head in a satisfied way.",
    "Why on earth should Communists want to murder poor grandfather\n\nWell everyone says that theyre at the bottom of everything that goes\non.",
    "But if it wasnt the Communists mark my word it was the\nCatholics.",
    "The Scarlet Woman of Babylon thats what they are.",
    "With the air of one saying the last word Nannie disappeared again into\nthe scullery.",
    "Sophia and I laughed.",
    "A good old Black Protestant I said.",
    "Yes isnt she Come on Charles come into the drawing room.",
    "Theres a kind of family conclave going on.",
    "It was scheduled for this\nevening  but its started prematurely.",
    "Id better not butt in Sophia.",
    "If youre ever going to marry into the family youd better see just what\nits like when it has the gloves off.",
    "Whats it all about\n\nRogers affairs.",
    "You seem to have been mixed up in them already.",
    "But\nyoure crazy to think that Roger would ever have killed grandfather.",
    "Why Roger adored him.",
    "I didnt really think Roger had.",
    "I thought Clemency might have.",
    "Only because I put it into your head.",
    "But youre wrong there too.",
    "I\ndont think Clemency will mind a bit if Roger loses all his money.",
    "I think\nshell actually be rather pleased.",
    "Shes got a queer kind of passion for\nnot having things.",
    "Come on.",
    "When Sophia and I entered the drawing room the voices that were\nspeaking stopped abruptly.",
    "Everybody looked at us.",
    "They were all there.",
    "Philip sitting in a big crimson brocaded armchair\nbetween the windows his beautiful face set in a cold stern mask.",
    "He\nlooked like a judge about to pronounce sentence.",
    "Roger was astride a\nbig pouf by the fireplace.",
    "He had ruffled up his hair between his fingers\nuntil it stood up all over his head.",
    "His left trouser leg was rucked up\n\n\fand his tie was askew.",
    "He looked flushed and argumentative.",
    "Clemency sat beyond him her slight form seemed too slender for the\nbig stuffed chair.",
    "She was looking away from the others and seemed to\nbe studying the wall panels with a dispassionate gaze.",
    "Edith sat in a\ngrandfather chair bolt upright.",
    "She was knitting with incredible\nenergy her lips pressed tightly together.",
    "The most beautiful thing in\nthe room to look at was Magda and Eustace.",
    "They looked like a portrait\nby Gainsborough.",
    "They sat together on the sofa  the dark handsome\nboy with a sullen expression on his face and beside him one arm\nthrust out along the back of the sofa sat Magda the Duchess of Three\nGables in a picture gown of taffeta with one small foot in a brocaded\nslipper thrust out in front of her.",
    "Philip frowned.",
    "Sophia he said Im sorry but we are discussing family matters\nwhich are of a private nature.",
    "Miss de Havilands needles clicked.",
    "I prepared to apologise and\nretreat.",
    "Sophia forestalled me.",
    "Her voice was clear and determined.",
    "Charles and I she said hope to get married.",
    "I want Charles to be\nhere.",
    "And why on earth not cried Roger springing up from his pouf with\nexplosive energy.",
    "I keep telling you Philip theres nothing private\nabout this The whole world is going to know tomorrow or the day\nafter.",
    "Anyway my dear boy he came and put a friendly hand on my\nshoulder you know all about it.",
    "You were there this morning.",
    "Do tell me cried Magda leaning forward.",
    "What is it like at Scotland\nYard.",
    "One always wonders.",
    "A table.",
    "A desk Chairs What kind of\ncurtains No flowers I suppose A dictaphone\n\nPut a sock in it mother said Sophia.",
    "And anyway you told\nVavasour Jones to cut that Scotland Yard scene.",
    "You said it was an\nanticlimax.",
    "It makes it too like a detective play said Magda.",
    "Edith Thompson is\ndefinitely a psychological drama  or psychological thriller  which do\nyou think sounds best\n\nYou were there this morning Philip asked me sharply.",
    "Why Oh of\ncourse  your father \n\nHe frowned.",
    "I realised more clearly than ever that my presence was\nunwelcome but Sophias hand was clenched on my arm.",
    "Clemency moved a chair forward.",
    "Do sit down she said.",
    "I gave her a grateful glance and accepted.",
    "You may say what you like said Miss de Haviland apparently going\non from where they had all left off but I do think we ought to respect\nAristides wishes.",
    "When this will business is straightened out as far as\nI am concerned my legacy is entirely at your disposal Roger.",
    "Roger tugged his hair in a frenzy.",
    "No Aunt Edith.",
    "No he cried.",
    "I wish I could say the same said Philip but one has to take every\nfactor into consideration \n\nDear old Phil dont you understand Im not going to take a penny\nfrom anyone.",
    "Of course he cant snapped Clemency.",
    "Anyway Edith said Magda.",
    "If the will is straightened out hell have\nhis own legacy.",
    "But it cant possibly be straightened out in time can it asked\nEustace.",
    "You dont know anything about it Eustace said Philip.",
    "The boys absolutely right cried Roger.",
    "Hes put his finger on the\nspot.",
    "Nothing can avert the crash.",
    "Nothing.",
    "He spoke with a kind of relish.",
    "There is really nothing to discuss said Clemency.",
    "Anyway said Roger what does it matter\n\nI should have thought it mattered a good deal said Philip pressing\nhis lips together.",
    "No said Roger.",
    "No Does anything matter compared with the fact\nthat father is dead Father is dead And we sit here discussing mere\nmoney matters\n\nA faint colour rose in Philips pale cheeks.",
    "We are only trying to help he said stiffly.",
    "I know Phil old boy I know.",
    "But theres nothing anyone can do.",
    "So\nlets call it a day.",
    "I suppose said Philip that I could raise a certain amount of money.",
    "Securities have gone down a good deal and some of my capital is tied\nup in such a way that I cant touch it Magdas settlement and so on but \n\nMagda said quickly\n\nOf course you cant raise the money darling.",
    "It would be absurd to try\n and not very fair on the children.",
    "I tell you Im not asking anyone for anything shouted Roger.",
    "Im\nhoarse with telling you so.",
    "Im quite content that things should take\ntheir course.",
    "Its a question of prestige said Philip.",
    "Fathers.",
    "Ours.",
    "It wasnt a family business.",
    "It was solely my concern.",
    "Yes said Philip looking at him.",
    "It was entirely your concern.",
    "Edith de Haviland got up and said I think weve discussed this\nenough.",
    "There was in her voice that authentic note of authority that never fails\nto produce its effect.",
    "Philip and Magda got up.",
    "Eustace lounged out of the room and I\nnoticed the stiffness of his gait.",
    "He was not exactly lame but his walk\nwas a halting one.",
    "Roger linked his arm in Philips and said Youve been a brick Phil\neven to think of such a thing The brothers went out together.",
    "Magda murmured Such a fuss as she followed them and Sophia\nsaid that she must see about my room.",
    "Edith de Haviland stood rolling up her knitting.",
    "She looked towards me\nand I thought she was going to speak to me.",
    "There was something almost like appeal in her glance.",
    "However she\nchanged her mind sighed and went out after the others.",
    "Clemency had moved over to the window and stood looking out into\nthe garden.",
    "I went over and stood beside her.",
    "She turned her head\nslightly towards me.",
    "Thank goodness thats over she said  and added with distaste\nWhat a preposterous room this is\n\n\fDont you like it\n\nI cant breathe in it.",
    "Theres always a smell of half dead flowers and\ndust.",
    "I thought she was unjust to the room.",
    "But I knew what she meant.",
    "It\nwas very definitely an interior.",
    "It was a womans room exotic soft shut away from the rude blasts of\noutside weather.",
    "It was not a room that a man would be happy in for\nlong.",
    "It was not a room where you could relax and read the newspaper\nand smoke a pipe and put up your feet.",
    "Nevertheless I preferred it to\nClemencys own abstract expression of herself upstairs.",
    "On the whole\nI prefer a boudoir to an operating theatre.",
    "Its just a stage set.",
    "A background for Magda to play her scenes\nagainst.",
    "She looked at me.",
    "You realise dont you what weve just\nbeen doing Act II  the family conclave.",
    "Magda arranged it.",
    "It didnt\nmean a thing.",
    "There was nothing to talk about nothing to discuss.",
    "Its\nall settled  finished.",
    "There was no sadness in her voice.",
    "Rather there was satisfaction.",
    "She\ncaught my glance.",
    "Oh dont you understand she said impatiently.",
    "Were free  at last\nDont you understand that Rogers been miserable  absolutely\nmiserable  for years He never had any aptitude for business.",
    "He likes\nthings like horses and cows and pottering round in the country.",
    "But he\nadored his father  they all did.",
    "Thats whats wrong with this house \n\n\ftoo much family.",
    "I dont mean that the old man was a tyrant or preyed\nupon them or bullied them.",
    "He didnt.",
    "He gave them money and\nfreedom.",
    "He was devoted to them.",
    "And they kept on being devoted to\nhim.",
    "Is there anything wrong in that\n\nI think there is.",
    "I think when your children have grown up that you\nshould cut away from them efface yourself slink away force them to\nforget you.",
    "Force them Thats rather drastic isnt it Isnt coercion as bad one\nway as another\n\nIf he hadnt made himself such a personality \n\nYou cant make yourself a personality I said.",
    "He was a personality.",
    "He was too much of a personality for Roger.",
    "Roger worshipped him.",
    "He wanted to do everything his father wanted him to do he wanted to\nbe the kind of son his father wanted.",
    "And he couldnt.",
    "His father made\nover Associated Catering to him  it was the old mans particular joy\nand pride and Roger tried hard to carry on in his fathers footsteps.",
    "But he hadnt got that kind of ability.",
    "In business matters Roger is  yes\nIll say it plainly  a fool.",
    "And it nearly broke his heart.",
    "Hes been\nmiserable for years struggling seeing the whole thing go down the\nhill having sudden wonderful ideas and schemes which always went\nwrong and made it worse than ever.",
    "Its a terrible thing to feel youre a\nfailure year after year.",
    "You dont know how unhappy hes been.",
    "I do.",
    "Again she turned and faced me.",
    "You thought you actually suggested to the police that Roger would\nhave killed his father  for money You dont know how  how absolutely\nridiculous that is\n\nI do know it now I said humbly.",
    "When Roger knew he couldnt stave it off any more  that the crash\nwas bound to come he was actually relieved.",
    "Yes he was.",
    "He worried\nabout his fathers knowing  but not about anything else.",
    "He was\nlooking forward to the new life we were going to live.",
    "Her face quivered a little and her voice softened.",
    "Where were you going I asked.",
    "To Barbados.",
    "A distant cousin of mine died a short time ago and left\nme a tiny estate out there  oh nothing much.",
    "But it was somewhere to\ngo.",
    "Wed have been desperately poor but wed have scratched a living\n it costs very little just to live.",
    "Wed have been together  unworried\naway from them all.",
    "She sighed.",
    "Roger is a ridiculous person.",
    "He would worry about me  about my\nbeing poor.",
    "I suppose hes got the Leonides attitude to money too\nfirmly in his mind.",
    "When my first husband was alive we were terribly\npoor  and Roger thinks it was so brave and wonderful of me He\n\n\fdoesnt realise that I was happy  really happy Ive never been so\nhappy since.",
    "And yet  I never loved Richard as I love Roger.",
    "Her eyes halfclosed.",
    "I was aware of the intensity of her feeling.",
    "She opened her eyes looked at me and said\n\nSo you see I would never have killed anyone for money.",
    "I dont like\nmoney.",
    "I was quite sure that she meant exactly what she said.",
    "Clemency\nLeonides was one of those rare people to whom money does not\nappeal.",
    "They dislike luxury prefer austerity and are suspicious of\npossessions.",
    "Still there are many to whom money has no personal appeal but who\ncan be tempted by the power it confers.",
    "I said You mightnt want money for yourself  but wisely directed\nmoney may do a lot of interesting things.",
    "It can endow research for\nexample.",
    "I had suspected that Clemency might be a fanatic about her work but\nshe merely said\n\nI doubt if endowments ever do much good.",
    "Theyre usually spent in\nthe wrong way.",
    "The things that are worth while are usually\naccomplished by someone with enthusiasm and drive  and with\nnatural vision.",
    "Expensive equipment and training and experiment\n\n\fnever does what youd imagine it might do.",
    "The spending of it usually\ngets into the wrong hands.",
    "Will you mind giving up your work when you go to Barbados I\nasked.",
    "Youre still going I presume\n\nOh yes as soon as the police will let us.",
    "No I shant mind giving up my\nwork at all.",
    "Why should I I wouldnt like to be idle but I shant be idle\nin Barbados.",
    "She added impatiently\n\nOh if only this could all be cleared up quickly and we could get\naway.",
    "Clemency I said have you any idea at all who did do this Granting\nthat you and Roger had no hand in it and really I cant see any reason\nto think you had surely with your intelligence you must have some\nidea of who did\n\nShe gave me a rather peculiar look a darting sideways glance.",
    "When\nshe spoke her voice had lost its spontaneity.",
    "It was awkward rather\nembarrassed.",
    "One cant make guesses its unscientific she said.",
    "One can only\nsay that Brenda and Laurence are the obvious suspects.",
    "So you think they did it\n\nClemency shrugged her shoulders.",
    "She stood for a moment as though listening then she went out of the\nroom passing Edith de Haviland in the doorway.",
    "Edith came straight over to me.",
    "I want to talk to you she said.",
    "My fathers words leapt into my mind.",
    "Was this \n\nBut Edith de Haviland was going on\n\nI hope you didnt get the wrong impression she said.",
    "About Philip I\nmean.",
    "Philip is rather difficult to understand.",
    "He may seem to you\nreserved and cold but that is not so at all.",
    "Its just a manner.",
    "He cant\nhelp it.",
    "I really hadnt thought  I began.",
    "But she swept on.",
    "Just now  about Roger.",
    "It isnt really that hes grudging.",
    "Hes never\nbeen mean about money.",
    "And hes really a dear  hes always been a\ndear  but he needs understanding.",
    "I looked at her with the air I hope of one who was willing to\nunderstand.",
    "She went on\n\nIts partly I think from having been the second of the family.",
    "Theres\noften something about a second child  they often come uncalled for.",
    "He adored his father you see.",
    "Of course all the children adored\nAristide and he adored them.",
    "But Roger was his especial pride and joy.",
    "Being the eldest  the first.",
    "And I think Philip felt it.",
    "He drew back right\ninto himself.",
    "He began to like books and the past and things that were\nwell divorced from everyday life.",
    "I think he suffered  children do suffer\n\n\nShe paused and went on\n\nWhat I really mean I suppose is that hes always been jealous of\nRoger.",
    "I think perhaps he doesnt know it himself.",
    "But I think the fact\nthat Roger has come a cropper  oh it seems an odious thing to say\nand really Im sure he doesnt realise it himself  but I think perhaps\nPhilip isnt as sorry about it as he ought to be.",
    "You mean really that hes rather pleased Roger has made a fool of\nhimself.",
    "Yes said Miss de Haviland.",
    "I mean just exactly that.",
    "She added frowning a little\n\nIt distressed me you know that he didnt at once offer help to his\nbrother.",
    "Why should he I said.",
    "After all Roger has made a muck of things.",
    "Hes a grown man.",
    "There are no children to consider.",
    "If he were ill or in\nreal want of course his family would help  but Ive no doubt Roger\nwould really much prefer to start afresh entirely on his own.",
    "Oh he would.",
    "Its only Clemency he minds about.",
    "And Clemency is an\nextraordinary creature.",
    "She really likes being uncomfortable and\nhaving only one utility teacup to drink out of.",
    "Modern I suppose.",
    "Shes\nno sense of the past no sense of beauty.",
    "I felt her shrewd eyes looking me up and down.",
    "This is a dreadful ordeal for Sophia she said.",
    "I am so sorry her\nyouth should be dimmed by it.",
    "I love them all you know.",
    "Roger and\nPhilip and now Sophia and Eustace and Josephine.",
    "All the dear\nchildren.",
    "Marcias children.",
    "Yes I love them dearly.",
    "She paused and\nthen added sharply But mind you this side idolatry.",
    "She turned abruptly and went.",
    "I had the feeling that she had meant\nsomething by her last remark that I did not quite understand.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nYour rooms ready said Sophia.",
    "She stood by my side looking out at the garden.",
    "It looked bleak and\ngrey now with the half denuded trees swaying in the wind.",
    "Sophia echoed my thought as she said How desolate it looks...\n\nAs we watched a figure and then presently another came through the\nyew hedge from the rock garden.",
    "They both looked grey and\nunsubstantial in the fading light.",
    "Brenda Leonides was the first.",
    "She was wrapped in a grey chinchilla\ncoat and there was something catlike and stealthy in the way she\nmoved.",
    "She slipped through the twilight with a kind of eerie grace.",
    "I saw her face as she passed the window.",
    "There was a half smile on it\nthe curving crooked smile I had noticed upstairs.",
    "A few minutes later\nLaurence Brown looking slender and shrunken also slipped through\nthe twilight.",
    "I can only put it that way.",
    "They did not seem like two\npeople walking two people who had been out for a stroll.",
    "There was\nsomething furtive and unsubstantial about them like two ghosts.",
    "I wondered if it was under Brendas or Laurences foot that a twig had\nsnapped.",
    "By a natural association of ideas I asked\n\nWheres Josephine\n\nProbably with Eustace up in the schoolroom.",
    "She frowned.",
    "Im\nworried about Eustace Charles.",
    "Why\n\nHes so moody and odd.",
    "Hes been so different ever since that\nwretched paralysis.",
    "I cant make out whats going on in his mind.",
    "Sometimes he seems to hate us all.",
    "Hell probably grow out of all that.",
    "Its just a phase.",
    "Yes I suppose so.",
    "But I do get worried Charles.",
    "Why dear heart\n\nReally I suppose because mother and father never worry.",
    "Theyre\nnot like a mother and father.",
    "That may be all for the best.",
    "More children suffer from interference\nthan from noninterference.",
    "Thats true.",
    "You know I never thought about it until I came back from\nabroad but they really are a queer couple.",
    "Father living determinedly\nin a world of obscure historical bypaths and mother having a lovely\ntime creating scenes.",
    "That tomfoolery this evening was all mother.",
    "There was no need for it.",
    "She just wanted to play a family conclave\nscene.",
    "She gets bored you know down here and has to try and work\nup a drama.",
    "For the moment I had a fantastic vision of Sophias mother poisoning\nher elderly fatherinlaw in a lighthearted manner in order to observe\na murder drama at first hand with herself in the leading r\u00f4le.",
    "An amusing thought I dismissed it as such  but it left me a little\nuneasy.",
    "Mother said Sophia has to be looked after the whole time.",
    "You\nnever know what shes up to\n\nForget your family Sophia I said firmly.",
    "I shall be only too delighted to but its a little difficult at the present\nmoment.",
    "But I was happy out in Cairo when I had forgotten them all.",
    "I remembered how Sophia had never mentioned her home or her\npeople.",
    "Is that why you never talked about them I asked.",
    "Because you\nwanted to forget them\n\nI think so.",
    "Weve always all of us lived too much in each others\npockets.",
    "Were  were all too fond of each other.",
    "Were not like some\nfamilies where they all hate each other like poison.",
    "That must be pretty\nbad but its almost worse to live all tangled up in conflicting\naffections.",
    "She added\n\nI think thats what I meant when I said we all lived together in a little\ncrooked house.",
    "I didnt mean that it was crooked in the dishonest\nsense.",
    "I think what I meant was that we hadnt been able to grow up\nindependent standing by ourselves upright.",
    "Were all a bit twisted\nand twining.",
    "I saw Edith de Havilands heel grinding a weed into the path as Sophia\nadded Like bindweed...\n\nAnd then suddenly Magda was with us  flinging open the door  crying\nout\n\nDarlings why dont you have the lights on Its almost dark.",
    "And she pressed the switches and the lights sprang up on the walls\nand on the tables and she and Sophia and I pulled the heavy rose\ncurtains and there we were in the flowerscented interior and Magda\nflinging herself on the sofa cried\n\nWhat an incredible scene it was wasnt it How cross Eustace was\nHe told me he thought it was all positively indecent.",
    "How funny boys\nare\n\nShe sighed.",
    "Rogers rather a pet.",
    "I love him when he rumples his hair and starts\nknocking things over.",
    "Wasnt it sweet of Edith to offer her legacy to\nhim She really meant it you know it wasnt just a gesture.",
    "But it was\nterribly stupid  it might have made Philip think he ought to do it too Of\ncourse Edith would do anything for the family Theres something very\npathetic in the love of a spinster for her sisters children.",
    "Someday I\nshall play one of those devoted spinster aunts.",
    "Inquisitive and\nobstinate and devoted.",
    "It must have been hard for her after her sister died I said refusing to\nbe sidetracked into discussion of another of Magdas r\u00f4les.",
    "I mean if\nshe disliked old Leonides so much.",
    "Magda interrupted me.",
    "Disliked him Who told you that Nonsense.",
    "She was in love with\nhim.",
    "Mother said Sophia.",
    "Now dont try and contradict me Sophia.",
    "Naturally at your age you\nthink I love is all two good looking young people in the moonlight.",
    "She told me I said that she had always disliked him.",
    "Probably she did when she first came.",
    "Shed been angry with her\nsister for marrying him.",
    "I daresay there was always some antagonism but she was in love with him all right Darlings I do know what Im\ntalking about Of course with deceased wifes sister and all that he\ncouldnt have married her and I daresay he never thought of it  and\nquite probably she didnt either.",
    "She was quite happy mothering the\nchildren and having fights with him.",
    "But she didnt like it when he\nmarried Brenda.",
    "She didnt like it a bit\n\nNo more did you and father said Sophia.",
    "No of course we hated it Naturally But Edith hated it most.",
    "Darling\nthe way Ive seen her look at Brenda\n\nNow mother said Sophia.",
    "Magda threw her an affectionate and half guilty glance the glance of a\nmischievous spoilt child.",
    "She went on with no apparent realization of any lack of continuity\n\nIve decided Josephine really must go to school.",
    "Josephine To school.",
    "Yes.",
    "To Switzerland.",
    "Im going to see about it tomorrow.",
    "I really think\nwe might get her off at once.",
    "Its so bad for her to be mixed up in a\nhorrid business like this.",
    "Shes getting quite morbid about it.",
    "What she\nneeds is other children of her own age.",
    "School life.",
    "Ive always thought\nso.",
    "Grandfather didnt want her to go to school said Sophia slowly.",
    "He\nwas very much against it.",
    "Darling old Sweetie Pie liked us all here under his eye.",
    "Very old\npeople are often selfish in that way.",
    "A child ought to be amongst other\nchildren.",
    "And Switzerland is so healthy  all the winter sports and the\nair and such much much better food than we get here\n\nIt will be difficult to arrange for Switzerland now with all the currency\nregulations wont it I asked.",
    "Nonsense Charles.",
    "Theres some kind of educational racket  or you\nexchange with a Swiss child  there are all sorts of ways.",
    "Rudolf Alstirs\nin Lausanne.",
    "I shall wire him tomorrow to arrange everything.",
    "We can\nget her off by the end of the week\n\nMagda punched a cushion smiled at us went to the door stood a\nmoment looking back at us in a quite enchanting fashion.",
    "Its only the young who count she said.",
    "As she said it it was a lovely\nline.",
    "They must always come first.",
    "And darlings  think of the flowers the blue gentians the narcissus...",
    "In November asked Sophia but Magda had gone.",
    "Sophia heaved an exasperated sigh.",
    "Really she said Mother is too trying She gets these sudden ideas\nand she sends thousands of telegrams and everything has to be\narranged at a moments notice.",
    "Why should Josephine be hustled off to\nSwitzerland all in a flurry\n\nTheres probably something in the idea of school.",
    "I think children of\nher own age would be a good thing for Josephine.",
    "Grandfather didnt think so said Sophia obstinately.",
    "I felt slightly irritated.",
    "My dear Sophia do you really think an old gentleman of over eighty is\nthe best judge of a childs welfare\n\nHe was about the best judge of anybody in this house said Sophia.",
    "Better than your Aunt Edith\n\nNo perhaps not.",
    "She did rather favour school.",
    "I admit Josephines got\ninto rather difficult ways  shes got a horrible habit of snooping.",
    "But I\nreally think its just because shes playing detectives.",
    "Was it only the concern for Josephines welfare which had occasioned\nMagdas sudden decision I wondered.",
    "Josephine was remarkably\nwell informed about all sorts of things that had happened prior to the\n\n\fmurder and which had been certainly no business of hers.",
    "A healthy\nschool life with plenty of games would probably do her a world of\ngood.",
    "But I did rather wonder at the suddenness and urgency of\nMagdas decision  Switzerland was a long way off.",
    "Chapter 16\n\nThe Old Man had said Let them talk to you.",
    "As I shaved the following morning I considered just how far that had\ntaken me.",
    "Edith de Haviland had talked to me  she had sought me out for that\nespecial purpose.",
    "Clemency had talked to me or had I talked to her.",
    "Magda had talked to me in a sense  that is I had formed part of the\naudience to one of her broadcasts.",
    "Sophia naturally had talked to me.",
    "Even Nannie had talked to me.",
    "Was I\nany the wiser for what I had learned from them all Was there any\nsignificant word or phrase More was there any evidence of that\nabnormal vanity on which my father had laid stress I couldnt see that\nthere was.",
    "The only person who had shown absolutely no desire to talk\nto me in any way nor on any subject was Philip.",
    "Was not that in a\nway rather abnormal He must know by now that I wanted to marry\nhis daughter.",
    "Yet he continued to act as though I was not in the house at all.",
    "Presumably he resented my presence there.",
    "Edith de Haviland had\n\n\fapologised for him.",
    "She had said it was just manner.",
    "She had shown\nherself concerned about Philip.",
    "Why\n\nI considered Sophias father.",
    "He was in every sense a repressed\nindividual.",
    "He had been an unhappy jealous child.",
    "He had been forced\nback into himself.",
    "He had taken refuge in the world of books  in the\nhistorical past.",
    "That studied coldness and reserve of his might conceal\na good deal of passionate feeling.",
    "The inadequate motive of financial\ngain by his fathers death was unconvincing  I did not think for a\nmoment that Philip Leonides would kill his father because he himself\nhad not quite as much money as he would like to have.",
    "But there might\nhave been some deep psychological reason for his desiring his\nfathers death.",
    "Philip had come back to his fathers house to live and\nlater as a result of the Blitz Roger had come  and Philip had been\nobliged to see day by day that Roger was his fathers favourite... Might\nthings have come to such a pass in his tortured mind that the only\nrelief possible was his fathers death And supposing that that death\nshould incriminate his elder brother Roger was short of money  on\nthe verge of a crash.",
    "Knowing nothing of that last interview between\nRoger and his father and the latters offer of assistance might not\nPhilip have believed that the motive would seem so powerful that\nRoger would be at once suspected Was Philips mental balance\nsufficiently disturbed to lead him to do murder\n\nI cut my chin with the razor and swore.",
    "What the hell was I trying to do Fasten murder on Sophias father\nThat was a nice thing to try and do That wasnt what Sophia had\nwanted me to come down here for.",
    "Or  was it There was something had been something all along\nbehind Sophias appeal.",
    "If there was any lingering suspicion in her\nmind that her father was the killer then she would never consent to\nmarry me  in case that suspicion might be true.",
    "And since she was Sophia cleareyed and brave she wanted the\ntruth since uncertainty would be an eternal and perpetual barrier\nbetween us.",
    "Hadnt she been in effect saying to me Prove that this\ndreadful thing I am imagining is not true  but if it is true then prove its\ntruth to me  so that I can know the worst and face it\n\nDid Edith de Haviland know or suspect that Philip was guilty.",
    "What\nhad she meant by this side idolatry\n\nAnd what had Clemency meant by that peculiar look she had thrown at\nme when I asked her who she suspected and she had answered\nLaurence and Brenda are the obvious suspects arent they\n\nThe whole family wanted it to be Brenda and Laurence hoped it might\nbe Brenda and Laurence but didnt really believe it was Brenda and\nLaurence...\n\nAnd of course the whole family might be wrong and it might really be\nLaurence and Brenda after all.",
    "Or it might be Laurence and not Brenda...\n\nThat would be a much better solution.",
    "I finished dabbing at my cut chin\nand went down to breakfast filled with the determination to have an\ninterview with Laurence Brown as soon as possible.",
    "It was only as I drank my second cup of coffee that it occurred to me\nthat the Crooked House was having its effect on me also.",
    "I too wanted\nto find not the true solution but the solution that suited me best.",
    "After breakfast I went out through the hall and up the stairs.",
    "Sophia\nhad told me that I should find Laurence giving instruction to Eustace\nand Josephine in the schoolroom.",
    "I hesitated on the landing outside Brendas front door.",
    "Did I ring and\nknock or did I walk right in I decided to treat the house as an integral\nLeonides home and not as Brendas private residence.",
    "I opened the door and passed inside.",
    "Everything was quiet there seemed to be no one about.",
    "On my left the\ndoor into the big drawing room was closed.",
    "On my right two open\ndoors showed a bedroom and adjoining bathroom.",
    "This I knew was the\nbathroom adjoining Aristide Leonides s bedroom where the eserine\nand the insulin had been kept.",
    "The police had finished with it now.",
    "I\npushed the door open and slipped inside.",
    "I realised then how easy it\nwould have been for anyone in the house or from outside the house\nfor the matter of that to come up here and into the bathroom unseen.",
    "I stood in the bathroom looking round.",
    "It was sumptuously appointed with gleaming tiles and a sunk bath.",
    "At\none side were various electric appliances a hot plate and grill under\nan electric kettle  a small electric saucepan a toaster  everything\nthat a valet attendant to an old gentleman might need.",
    "On the wall was\n\n\fa white enamelled cupboard.",
    "I opened it.",
    "Inside were medical\nappliances two medicine glasses eyebath eye dropper and a few\nlabelled\n\nbottles.",
    "Aspirin\n\nBoracic\n\npowder\n\niodine.",
    "Elastoplast\n\nbandages etc.",
    "On a separate shelf were the stacked supply of insulin\ntwo hypodermic needles and a bottle of surgical spirit.",
    "On a third shelf\nwas a bottle marked The Tablets  one or two to be taken at night as\nordered.",
    "On this shelf no doubt had stood the bottle of eyedrops.",
    "It\nwas all clear well arranged easy for anyone to get at if needed and\nequally easy to get at for murder.",
    "I could do what I liked with the bottles and then go softly out and\ndownstairs again and nobody would ever know I had been there.",
    "All\nthis was of course nothing new but it brought home to me how\ndifficult the task of the police was.",
    "Only from the guilty party or parties could one find out what one\nneeded.",
    "Rattle em Taverner had said to me.",
    "Get em on the run.",
    "Make em\nthink were on to something.",
    "Keep ourselves well in the limelight.",
    "Sooner or later if we do our criminal will stop leaving well alone and\ntry to be smarter still  and then  weve got him.",
    "Well the criminal hadnt reacted to this treatment so far.",
    "I came out of the bathroom.",
    "Still no one about.",
    "I went on along the\ncorridor.",
    "I passed the diningroom on the left and Brendas bedroom\nand bathroom on the right.",
    "In the latter one of the maids was moving\nabout.",
    "The dining room door was closed.",
    "From a room beyond that I\nheard Edith de Havilands voice telephoning to the inevitable\n\n\ffishmonger.",
    "A spiral flight of stairs led to the floor above.",
    "I went up\nthem.",
    "Ediths bedroom and sitting room was here I knew and two\nmore bathrooms and Laurence Browns room.",
    "Beyond that again the\nshort flight of steps down to the big room built out over the servants\nquarters at the back which was used as a schoolroom.",
    "Outside the door I paused.",
    "Laurence Browns voice could be heard\nslightly damped from inside.",
    "I think Josephines habit of snooping must have been catching.",
    "Quite\nunashamedly I leaned against the door jamb and listened.",
    "It was a\nhistory lesson that was in progress and the period in question was the\nFrench directoire.",
    "As I listened astonishment opened my eyes.",
    "It was a considerable\nsurprise to me to discover that Laurence Brown was a magnificent\nteacher.",
    "I dont know why it should have surprised me so much.",
    "After all\nAristide Leonides had always been a good picker of men.",
    "For all his\nmouselike exterior Laurence had that supreme gift of being able to\narouse enthusiasm and imagination in his pupils.",
    "The drama of Thermidor the decree of Outlawry against the\nRobespierrists the magnificence of Barras the cunning of Fouche Napoleon the half starved young gunner lieutenant  all these were\nreal and living.",
    "Suddenly Laurence stopped he asked Eustace and Josephine a\nquestion he made them put themselves in the places of first one and\nthen another figure in the drama.",
    "Though he did not get much result from Josephine whose voice\nsounded as though she had a cold in the head Eustace sounded quite\ndifferent from his usual moody self.",
    "He showed brains and intelligence and the keen historical sense which\nhe had doubtless inherited from his father.",
    "Then I heard the chairs being pushed back and scraped across the\nfloor.",
    "I retreated up the steps and was apparently just coming down\nthem when the door opened.",
    "Eustace and Josephine came out.",
    "Hullo I said.",
    "Eustace looked surprised to see me.",
    "Do you want anything he asked politely.",
    "Josephine taking no interest in my presence slipped past me.",
    "I just wanted to see the schoolroom I said rather feebly.",
    "You saw it the other day didnt you Its just a kids place really.",
    "Used\nto be the nursery.",
    "Its still got a lot of toys in it.",
    "He held the door open for me and I went in.",
    "Laurence Brown stood by the table.",
    "He looked up flushed murmured\nsomething in answer to my good morning and went hurriedly out.",
    "Youve scared him said Eustace.",
    "Hes very easily scared.",
    "Do you like him Eustace\n\nOh hes all right.",
    "An awful ass of course.",
    "But not a bad teacher\n\nNo as a matter of fact hes quite interesting.",
    "He knows an awful lot.",
    "He makes you see things from a different angle.",
    "I never knew that\nHenry the Eighth wrote poetry  to Anne Boleyn of course  jolly decent\npoetry.",
    "We talked for a few moments on such subjects as The Ancient Mariner\nChaucer the political implications behind the Crusades the Mediaeval\napproach to life and the to Eustace surprising fact that Oliver\nCromwell had prohibited the celebration of Christmas Day.",
    "Behind\nEustaces scornful and rather illtempered manner there was I\nperceived an inquiring and able mind.",
    "Very soon I began to realise the source of his ill humour.",
    "His illness\nhad not only been a frightening ordeal it had also been a frustration\nand a setback just at a moment when he had been enjoying life.",
    "I was to have been in the eleven next term  and Id got my house\ncolours.",
    "Its pretty thick to have to stop at home and do lessons with a\nrotten kid like Josephine.",
    "Why shes only twelve.",
    "Yes but you dont have the same studies do you\n\nNo of course she doesnt do advanced maths  or Latin.",
    "But you dont\nwant to have to share a tutor with a girl.",
    "I tried to soothe his injured male pride by remarking that Josephine\nwas quite an intelligent girl for her age.",
    "Dyou think so I think shes awfully wet.",
    "Shes mad keen on this\ndetecting stuff  goes round poking her nose in everywhere and writing\nthings down in a little black book and pretending that shes finding out\na lot.",
    "Just a silly kid thats all she is said Eustace loftily.",
    "Anyway he added girls cant be detectives.",
    "I told her so.",
    "I think\nmothers quite right and the sooner Jos packed off to Switzerland the\nbetter.",
    "Wouldnt you miss her\n\nMiss a kid of that age said Eustace haughtily.",
    "Of course not.",
    "My\ngoodness this house is the absolute limit Mother always haring up\nand down to London and bullying tame dramatists to rewrite plays for\nher and making frightful fusses about nothing at all.",
    "And father shut\nup with his books and sometimes not hearing you if you speak to him.",
    "I\ndont see why I should be cursed with such peculiar parents.",
    "Then\ntheres Uncle Roger  always so hearty that it makes you shudder.",
    "Aunt\n\n\fClemencys all right she doesnt bother you but I sometimes think\nshes a bit batty.",
    "Aunt Ediths not too bad but shes old.",
    "Things have\nbeen a bit more cheerful since Sophia came back  though she can be\npretty sharp sometimes.",
    "But it is a queer household dont you think\nso Having a stepgrandmother young enough to be your aunt or your\nolder sister.",
    "I mean it makes you feel an awful ass\n\nI had some comprehension of his feelings.",
    "I remembered very dimly\nmy own supersensitiveness at Eustaces age.",
    "My horror of appearing\nin any way unusual or of my near relatives departing from the normal.",
    "What about your grandfather I said.",
    "Were you fond of him\n\nA curious expression flitted across Eustaces face.",
    "Grandfather he said was definitely antisocial\n\nIn what way\n\nHe thought of nothing but the profit motive.",
    "Laurence says thats\ncompletely wrong.",
    "And he was a great individualist.",
    "All that sort of\nthing has got to go dont you think so\n\nWell I said rather brutally he has gone.",
    "A good thing really said Eustace.",
    "I dont want to be callous but\nyou cant really enjoy life at that age\n\nDidnt he\n\n\fHe couldnt have.",
    "Anyway it was time he went.",
    "He  Eustace broke\noff as Laurence Brown came back into the schoolroom.",
    "Laurence began fussing about with some books but I thought that he\nwas watching me out of the corner of his eye.",
    "He looked at his wristwatch and said\n\nPlease be back here sharp at eleven Eustace.",
    "Weve wasted too\nmuch time the last few days.",
    "O.K.",
    "sir.",
    "Eustace lounged towards the door and went out whistling.",
    "Laurence Brown darted another sharp glance at me.",
    "He moistened his\nlips once or twice.",
    "I was convinced that he had come back into the\nschoolroom solely in order to talk to me.",
    "Presently after a little aimless stacking and unstacking of books and a\npretence of looking for a book that was missing he turned to me.",
    "Er  How are they getting on he said.",
    "They\n\nThe police.",
    "His nose twitched.",
    "A mouse in a trap I thought a mouse in a trap.",
    "They dont take me into their confidence I said.",
    "Oh.",
    "I thought your father was the Assistant Commissioner.",
    "He is I said.",
    "But naturally he would not betray official secrets.",
    "I made my voice purposely pompous.",
    "Then you dont know how  what  if... His voice trailed off.",
    "Theyre\nnot going to make an arrest are they\n\nNot so far as I know.",
    "But then as I say I mightnt know.",
    "Get em on the run.",
    "Inspector Taverner had said.",
    "Get em rattled.",
    "Well\nLaurence Brown was rattled all right.",
    "He began talking quickly and nervously.",
    "You dont know what its like...",
    "The strain... Not knowing what  I\nmean they just come and go  Asking questions...",
    "Questions that dont\nseem to have anything to do with the case...",
    "He broke off.",
    "I waited.",
    "He wanted to talk  well then let him talk.",
    "You were there when the Chief Inspector made that monstrous\nsuggestion the other day About Mrs Leonides and myself...",
    "It was\nmonstrous.",
    "It makes one feel so helpless.",
    "One is powerless to prevent\npeople thinking things And it is all so wickedly untrue.",
    "Just because\nshe is  was  so many years younger than her husband.",
    "People have\n\n\fdreadful minds  dreadful minds...",
    "I feel  I cant help feeling that it is\nall a plot.",
    "A plot Thats interesting.",
    "It was interesting though not quite in the way he took it.",
    "The family you know Mr Leonides s family have never been\nsympathetic to me.",
    "They were always aloof.",
    "I always felt that they\ndespised me.",
    "His hands began to shake.",
    "Just because they have always been rich  and powerful.",
    "They looked\ndown on me.",
    "What was I to them Only the tutor.",
    "Only a wretched\nconscientious objector.",
    "And my objections were conscientious.",
    "They\nwere indeed\n\nI said nothing.",
    "All right then he burst out.",
    "What if I was  afraid Afraid Id make a\nmess of it.",
    "Afraid that when I had to pull a trigger  I mightnt be able to\nbring myself to do it.",
    "How can you be sure its a Nazi youre going to\nkill It might be some decent lad  some village boy  with no political\nleanings just called up for his countrys service.",
    "I believe war is\nwrong do you understand I believe it is wrong.",
    "I was still silent.",
    "I believed that my silence was achieving more than\nany arguments or agreements could do.",
    "Laurence Brown was arguing\nwith himself and in so doing was revealing a good deal of himself.",
    "Everyones always laughed at me.",
    "His voice shook.",
    "I seem to have a\nknack of making myself ridiculous.",
    "It isnt that I really lack courage but I always do the thing wrong.",
    "I went into a burning house to rescue\na woman they said was trapped there.",
    "But I lost the way at once and\nthe smoke made me unconscious and it gave a lot of trouble to the\nfiremen finding me.",
    "I heard them say Why couldnt the silly chump\nleave it to us Its no good my trying everyones against me.",
    "Whoever\nkilled Mr Leonides arranged it so that I would be suspected.",
    "Someone\nkilled him so as to ruin me.",
    "What about Mrs Leonides I asked.",
    "He flushed.",
    "He became less of a mouse and more like a man.",
    "Mrs Leonides is an angel he said an angel.",
    "Her sweetness her\nkindness to her elderly husband were wonderful.",
    "To think of her in\nconnection with poison is laughable  laughable And that thickheaded\nInspector cant see it\n\nHes prejudiced I said by the number of cases on his files where\nelderly husbands have been poisoned by sweet young wives.",
    "The insufferable dolt said Laurence Brown angrily.",
    "He went over to a bookcase in the corner and began rummaging the\nbooks in it.",
    "I didnt think I should get anything more out of him.",
    "I went\nslowly out of the room.",
    "As I was going along the passage a door on my\nleft opened and Josephine almost fell on top of me.",
    "Her appearance\nhad the suddenness of a demon in an oldfashioned pantomime.",
    "Her face and hands were filthy and a large cobweb floated from one\near.",
    "Where have you been Josephine\n\nI peered through the half open door.",
    "A couple of steps led up into the\natticlike rectangular space in the gloom of which several big tanks\ncould be seen.",
    "In the cistern room.",
    "Why in the cistern room\n\nJosephine replied in a brief businesslike way\n\nDetecting.",
    "What on earth is there to detect among the cisterns\n\nTo this Josephine merely replied\n\nI must wash.",
    "I should say most decidedly.",
    "Josephine disappeared through the nearest bathroom door.",
    "She\nlooked back to say\n\nI should say its about time for the next murder wouldnt you\n\n\fWhat do you mean  the next murder\n\nWell in books theres always a second murder about now.",
    "Someone\nwho knows something is bumped off before they can tell what they\nknow.",
    "You read too many detective stories Josephine.",
    "Real life isnt like\nthat.",
    "And if anybody in this house knows something the last thing they\nseem to want to do is to talk about it.",
    "Josephines reply came to me rather obscured by the gushing of water\nfrom a tap.",
    "Sometimes its something that they dont know that they do know.",
    "I blinked as I tried to think this out.",
    "Then leaving Josephine to her ablutions I went down to the floor\nbelow.",
    "Just as I was going out through the front door to the staircase Brenda\ncame with a soft rush through the drawing room door.",
    "She came close to me and laid her hand on my arm looking up in my\nface.",
    "Well she asked.",
    "It was the same demand for information that Laurence had made only\nit was phrased differently.",
    "And her one word far more effective.",
    "I shook my head.",
    "Nothing I said.",
    "She have a long sigh.",
    "Im so frightened she said.",
    "Charles Im so frightened...",
    "Her fear was very real.",
    "It communicated itself to me there in that\nnarrow space.",
    "I wanted to reassure her to help her.",
    "I had once more\nthat poignant sense of her as terribly alone in hostile surroundings.",
    "She might well have cried out Who is on my side\n\nAnd what would the answer have been Laurence Brown And what\nafter all was Laurence Brown No tower of strength in a time of\ntrouble.",
    "One of the weaker vessels.",
    "I remembered the two of them drifting in from the garden the night\nbefore.",
    "I wanted to help her.",
    "I badly wanted to help her.",
    "But there was nothing\nmuch I could say or do.",
    "And I had at the bottom of my mind an\nembarrassed guilty feeling as though Sophias scornful eyes were\nwatching me.",
    "I remembered Sophias voice saying So she got you.",
    "And Sophia did not see did not want to see Brendas side of it.",
    "Alone\nsuspected of murder with no one to stand by her.",
    "The inquests tomorrow Brenda said.",
    "What  what will happen\n\nThere I could reassure her.",
    "Nothing I said.",
    "You neednt worry about that.",
    "It will be adjourned\nfor the police to make enquiries.",
    "It will probably set the Press loose\nthough.",
    "So far theres been no indication in the papers that it wasnt a\nnatural death.",
    "The Leonides have got a good deal of influence.",
    "But\nwith an adjourned inquest  well the fun will start.",
    "What extraordinary things one said The fun Why must I choose that\nparticular word\n\nWill  will they be very dreadful\n\nI shouldnt give any interviews if I were you.",
    "You know Brenda you\nought to have a lawyer  She recoiled with a terrific gasp of dismay.",
    "No  no  not the way you mean.",
    "But someone to look after your\ninterests and advise you as to procedure and what to say and do and\nwhat not to say and do.",
    "You see I added youre very much alone.",
    "Her hand pressed my arm more closely.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "You do understand that.",
    "Youve helped Charles you\nhave helped...",
    "I went down the stairs with a feeling of warmth of satisfaction... Then I\nsaw Sophia standing by the front door.",
    "Her voice was cold and rather\ndry.",
    "What a long time youve been she said.",
    "They rang up for you from\nLondon.",
    "Your father wants you.",
    "At the Yard\n\nYes.",
    "I wonder what they want me for.",
    "They didnt say\n\nSophia shook her head.",
    "Her eyes were anxious.",
    "I drew her to me.",
    "Dont worry darling I said Ill soon be back.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nThere was something strained in the atmosphere of my fathers room.",
    "The Old Man sat behind his table.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner leaned\nagainst the window frame.",
    "In the visitors chair sat Mr Gaitskill\nlooking ruffled.",
    "extraordinary want of confidence he was saying acidly.",
    "Of course of course.",
    "My father spoke soothingly.",
    "Ah hullo Charles\nyouve made good time.",
    "Rather a surprising development has\noccurred.",
    "Unprecedented Mr Gaitskill said.",
    "Something had clearly ruffled the little lawyer to the core.",
    "Behind him.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner grinned at me.",
    "If I may recapitulate my father said.",
    "Mr Gaitskill received a\nsomewhat surprising communication this morning Charles.",
    "It was\nfrom a Mr Agrodopolous proprietor of the Delphos Restaurant.",
    "He is a\nvery old man a Greek by birth and when he was a young man he was\nhelped and befriended by Aristide Leonides.",
    "He has always remained\ndeeply grateful to his friend and benefactor and it seems that Leonides\nplaced great reliance and trust in him.",
    "I would never have believed Leonides was of such a suspicious and\nsecretive nature said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "Of course he was of advanced\nyears  practically in his dotage one might say.",
    "Nationality tells said my father gently.",
    "You see Gaitskill when you\nare very old your mind dwells a good deal on the days of your youth\nand the friends of your youth.",
    "But Leonidess affairs had been in my hands for well over forty years\nsaid Mr Gaitskill.",
    "Fortythree years and six months to be precise.",
    "Taverner grinned again.",
    "What happened I asked.",
    "Mr Gaitskill opened his mouth but my father forestalled him.",
    "Mr Agrodopolous stated in his communication that he was obeying\ncertain instructions given him by his friend Aristide Leonides.",
    "Briefly\nabout a year ago he had received a letter by Mr Leonides with a sealed\nenvelope which Mr Agrodopolous was to forward to Mr Gaitskill\nimmediately\n\nafter\n\nMr\n\nLeonidess\n\ndeath.",
    "In\n\nthe\n\nevent\n\nof\n\nMr\n\nAgrodopolous dying first his son a godson of Mr Leonides was to\ncarry out the same instructions.",
    "Mr Agrodopolous apologises for the\ndelay but explains that he has been ill with pneumonia and only\nlearned of his old friends death yesterday afternoon.",
    "The whole business is most unprofessional said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "When Mr Gaitskill had opened the sealed envelope and made himself\nacquainted with its contents he decided that it was his duty \n\nUnder the circumstances said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "To let us see the enclosures.",
    "They consist of a will duly signed and\nattested and a covering letter.",
    "So the will has turned up at last I said.",
    "Mr Gaitskill turned a bright purple.",
    "It is not the same will he barked.",
    "This is not the document I drew up\nat Mr Leonides s request.",
    "This has been written out in his own hand a\n\n\fmost dangerous thing for any layman to do.",
    "It seems to have been Mr\nLeonidess intention to make me look a complete fool.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner endeavoured to inject a little balm into the\nprevailing bitterness.",
    "He was a very old gentleman Mr Gaitskill he said.",
    "Theyre inclined\nto be cranky when they get old you know  not balmy of course but\njust a little eccentric.",
    "Mr Gaitskill sniffed.",
    "Mr Gaitskill rang us up my father said and apprised us of the main\ncontents of the will and I asked him to come round and bring the two\ndocuments with him.",
    "I also rang you up Charles.",
    "I did not see why I had been rung up.",
    "It seemed to me singularly\nunorthodox procedure on both my fathers and Taverners part.",
    "I\nshould have learnt about the will in due course and it was really not\nmy business at all how old Leonides had left his money.",
    "Is it a different will I asked.",
    "I mean does it dispose of his estate in\na different way\n\nIt does indeed said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "My father was looking at me.",
    "Chief Inspector Taverner was very\ncarefully not looking at me.",
    "In some way I felt vaguely uneasy...\n\n\fSomething was going on in both their minds  and it was a something to\nwhich I had no clue.",
    "I looked enquiringly at Gaitskill.",
    "Its none of my business I said.",
    "But \n\nHe responded.",
    "Mr Leonidess testamentary dispositions are not of course a secret\nhe said.",
    "I conceived it to be my duty to lay the facts before the police\nauthorities first and to be guided by them in my subsequent\nprocedure.",
    "I\n\nunderstand\n\nhe\n\npaused\n\nthat\n\nthere\n\nis\n\nan\n\n\n\nunderstanding shall we say  between you and Miss Sophia\nLeonides\n\nI hope to marry her I said but she will not consent to an\nengagement at the present time.",
    "Very proper said Mr Gaitskill.",
    "I disagreed with him.",
    "But this was no time for argument.",
    "By this will said Mr Gaitskill dated November the 29th of last year\nMr Leonides after a bequest to his wife of one hundred and fifty\nthousand pounds leaves his entire estate real and personal to his\ngranddaughter Sophia Katherine Leonides absolutely.",
    "I gasped.",
    "Whatever I had expected it was not this.",
    "He left the whole caboodle to Sophia I said.",
    "What an extraordinary\nthing.",
    "Any reason\n\nHe set out his reasons very clearly in the covering letter said my\nfather.",
    "He picked up a sheet of paper from the desk in front of him.",
    "You have no objection to Charles reading this Mr Gaitskill\n\nI am in your hands said Mr Gaitskill coldly.",
    "The letter does at least\noffer an explanation  and possibly though I am doubtful as to this an\nexcuse for Mr Leonidess extraordinary conduct.",
    "The Old Man handed me the letter.",
    "It was written in a small crabbed\nhandwriting in very black ink.",
    "The handwriting showed character and\nindividuality.",
    "It was not at all like the handwriting of an old man except perhaps for the careful forming of the letters more\ncharacteristic of a bygone period when literacy was something\npainstakingly acquired and correspondingly valued.",
    "Dear Gaitskill it ran\n\nYou will be astonished to get this and probably offended.",
    "But I have\nmy own reasons for behaving in what may seem to you an\nunnecessarily secretive manner.",
    "I have long been a believer in the\nindividual.",
    "In a family this I have observed in my boyhood and never\nforgotten there is always one strong character and it usually falls to\nthis one person to care for and bear the burden of the rest of the\nfamily.",
    "In my family I was that person.",
    "I came to London established\nmyself there supported my mother and my aged grandparents in\n\n\fSmyrna extricated one of my brothers from the grip of the law\nsecured the freedom of my sister from an unhappy marriage and so\non.",
    "God has been pleased to grant me a long life and I have been able\nto watch over and care for my children and their children.",
    "Many have\nbeen taken from me by death the rest I am happy to say are under\nmy roof.",
    "When I die the burden I have carried must descend on\nsomeone else.",
    "I have debated whether to divide my fortune as equally\nas possible amongst my dear ones  but to do so would not eventually\nresult in a proper equality.",
    "Men are not born equal  to offset the\nnatural inequality of Nature one must redress the balance.",
    "In other\nwords someone must be my successor must take upon him or herself\nthe burden of responsibility for the rest of the family.",
    "After close\nobservation I do not consider either of my sons fit for this\nresponsibility.",
    "My dearly loved son Roger has no business sense and\nthough of a lovable nature is too impulsive to have good judgement.",
    "My\nson Philip is too unsure of himself to do anything but retreat from life.",
    "Eustace my grandson is very young and I do not think he has the\nqualities of sense and judgement necessary.",
    "He is indolent and very\neasily influenced by the ideas of anyone whom he meets.",
    "Only my\ngranddaughter Sophia seems to me to have the positive qualities\nrequired.",
    "She has brains judgement courage a fair and unbiased\nmind and I think generosity of spirit.",
    "To her I commit the family\nwelfare  and the welfare of my kind sisterinlaw Edith de Haviland for\nwhose lifelong devotion to the family I am deeply grateful.",
    "This\nexplains the enclosed document.",
    "What will be harder to explain  or\nrather to explain to you my old friend  is the deception that I have\nemployed.",
    "I thought it wise not to raise speculation about the disposal\nof my money and I have no intention of letting my family know that\nSophia is to be my heir.",
    "Since my two sons have already had\nconsiderable fortunes settled upon them I do not feel that my\n\n\ftestamentary dispositions will place them in a humiliating position.",
    "To\nstifle curiosity and surmise I asked you to draw me up a will.",
    "This will I\nread aloud to my assembled family.",
    "I laid it on my desk placed a sheet\nof blotting paper over it and asked for two servants to be summoned.",
    "When they came I slid the blotting paper up a little exposing the\nbottom of a document signed my name and caused them to sign\ntheirs.",
    "I need hardly say that what I and they signed was the will which\nI now enclose and not the one drafted by you which I had read aloud.",
    "I\ncannot hope that you will understand what prompted me to execute\nthis trick.",
    "I will merely ask you to forgive me for keeping you in the\ndark.",
    "A very old man likes to keep his little secrets.",
    "Thank you my\ndear friend for the assiduity with which you have always attended to\nmy affairs.",
    "Give Sophia my dear love.",
    "Ask her to watch over the family\nwell and shield them from harm.",
    "Yours very sincerely\n\nAristide Leonides.",
    "I read this very remarkable document with intense interest.",
    "Extraordinary I said.",
    "Most extraordinary said Mr Gaitskill rising.",
    "I repeat I think my old\nfriend Mr Leonides might have trusted me.",
    "No Gaitskill said my father.",
    "He was a natural twister.",
    "He liked if I\nmay put it so doing things the crooked way.",
    "Thats right sir said Chief Inspector Taverner.",
    "He was a twister if\nthere ever was one\n\nHe spoke with feeling.",
    "Gaitskill stalked out unmollified.",
    "He had been wounded to the depths\nof his professional nature.",
    "Its hit him hard said Taverner.",
    "Very respectable firm Gaitskill\nCallum  Gaitskill.",
    "No hanky panky with them.",
    "When old Leonides put\nthrough a doubtful deal he never put it through with Gaitskill Callum \nGaitskill.",
    "He had half a dozen different firms of solicitors who acted for\nhim.",
    "Oh he was a twister\n\nAnd never more so than when making his will said my father.",
    "We were fools said Taverner.",
    "When you come to think of it the only\nperson who could have played tricks with that will was the old boy\nhimself.",
    "It just never occurred to us that he could want to\n\nI remembered Josephines superior smile as she had said\n\nArent the police stupid\n\nBut Josephine had not been present on the occasion of the will.",
    "And\neven if she had been listening outside the door which I was fully\nprepared to believe she could hardly have guessed what her\ngrandfather was doing.",
    "Why then the superior air What did she\n\n\fknow that made her say the police were stupid Or was it again just\nshowing off\n\nStruck by the silence in the room I looked up sharply  both my father\nand Taverner were watching me.",
    "I dont know what there was in their\nmanner that compelled me to blurt out defiantly\n\nSophia knew nothing about this Nothing at all.",
    "No said my father.",
    "I didnt quite know whether it was an agreement or a question.",
    "Shell be absolutely astounded\n\nYes\n\nAstounded\n\nThere was a pause.",
    "Then with what seemed sudden harshness the\ntelephone on my fathers desk rang.",
    "Yes He lifted the receiver  listened and then said Put her\nthrough.",
    "He looked at me.",
    "Its your young woman he said.",
    "She wants to speak to us.",
    "Its\nurgent.",
    "I took the receiver from him.",
    "Sophia\n\nCharles Is that you Its  Josephine\n\nHer voice broke slightly.",
    "What about Josephine\n\nShes been hit on the head.",
    "Concussion.",
    "Shes  shes pretty bad...",
    "They say she may not recover...",
    "I turned to the other two.",
    "Josephines been knocked out I said.",
    "My father took the receiver\nfrom me.",
    "He said sharply as he did so\n\nI told you to keep an eye on that child...\n\nChapter 18\n\nIn next to no time Taverner and I were racing in a fast police car in the\ndirection of Swinly Dean.",
    "I remembered Josephine emerging from among the cisterns and her\nairy remark that it was about time for the second murder.",
    "The poor\n\n\fchild had had no idea that she herself was likely to be the victim of the\nsecond murder.",
    "I accepted fully the blame that my father had tacitly ascribed to me.",
    "Of\ncourse I ought to have kept an eye on Josephine.",
    "Though neither Taverner nor I had any real clue to the poisoner of old\nLeonides it was highly possible that Josephine had.",
    "What I had taken for childish nonsense and showing off might very\nwell have been something quite different.",
    "Josephine in her favourite\nsports of snooping and prying might have become aware of some\npiece of information that she herself could not assess at its proper\nvalue.",
    "I remembered the twig that had cracked in the garden.",
    "I had had an inkling then that danger was about.",
    "I had acted upon it at\nthe moment and afterwards it had seemed to me that my suspicions\nhad been melodramatic and unreal.",
    "On the contrary.",
    "I should have\nrealised that this was murder that whoever committed murder had\nendangered their neck and that consequently that same person would\nnot hesitate to repeat the crime if by the way safety could be assured.",
    "Perhaps Magda but some obscure maternal instinct had recognised\nthat Josephine was in peril and that may have been what occasioned\nher sudden feverish haste to get the child sent to Switzerland.",
    "Sophia came out to meet us as we arrived.",
    "Josephine she said had\nbeen taken by ambulance to Market Basing General Hospital.",
    "Dr Gray would let them know as soon as possible the result of the Xray.",
    "How did it happen asked Taverner.",
    "Sophia led the way round to the back of the house and through a door\ninto a small disused yard.",
    "In one corner a door stood ajar.",
    "Its a kind of wash house Sophia explained.",
    "Theres a cat hole cut in\nthe bottom of the door and Josephine used to stand on it and swing to\nand fro.",
    "I remembered swinging on doors in my own youth.",
    "The wash house was small and rather dark.",
    "There were wooden boxes\nin it some old hose pipe a few derelict garden implements and some\nbroken furniture.",
    "Just inside the door was a marble lion door stop.",
    "Its the door stop from the front door Sophia explained.",
    "It must\nhave been balanced on the top of the door.",
    "Taverner reached up a hand to the top of the door.",
    "It was a low door\nthe top of it only about a foot above his head.",
    "A booby trap he said.",
    "He swung the door experimentally to and fro.",
    "Then he stooped to the\nblock of marble but he did not touch it.",
    "Has anyone handled this\n\nNo said Sophia.",
    "I wouldnt let any one touch it.",
    "Quite right.",
    "Who found her\n\nI did.",
    "She didnt come in for her dinner at one oclock.",
    "Nannie was\ncalling her.",
    "Shed passed through the kitchen and out into the stable\nyard about a quarter of an hour before.",
    "Nannie said Shell be\nbouncing her ball or swinging on that door again.",
    "I said Id fetch her\nin.",
    "Sophia paused.",
    "She had a habit of playing in that way you said Who knew about\nthat\n\nSophia shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Pretty well everybody in the house I should think.",
    "Who else used the wash house Gardeners\n\nSophia shook her head.",
    "Hardly anyone ever goes into it.",
    "And this little yard isnt overlooked from the house Taverner\nsummed it up.",
    "Anyone could have slipped out from the house or round\nthe front and fixed up that trap ready.",
    "But it would be chancy...",
    "He broke off looking at the door and swinging it gently to and fro.",
    "Nothing certain about it.",
    "Hit or miss.",
    "And likelier miss than hit.",
    "But she\nwas unlucky.",
    "With her it was hit.",
    "Sophia shivered.",
    "He peered at the floor.",
    "There were various dents on it.",
    "Looks as though someone experimented first... to see just how it\nwould fall...",
    "The sound wouldnt carry to the house.",
    "No we didnt hear anything.",
    "Wed no idea anything was wrong until I\ncame out and found her lying face down  all sprawled out.",
    "Sophias\nvoice broke a little.",
    "There was blood on her hair...\n\nThat her scarf Taverner pointed to a checked woollen muff lying on\nthe floor.",
    "Yes.",
    "Using the scarf he picked up the block of marble carefully.",
    "There may be fingerprints he said but he spoke without much hope.",
    "But I rather think whoever it was was  careful.",
    "He said to me What are you looking at\n\n\fI was looking at a broken backed wooden kitchen chair which was\namong the derelicts.",
    "On the seat of it were fragments of muddy feet.",
    "Curious said Taverner.",
    "Someone stood on that chair with muddy\nfeet.",
    "Now why was that\n\nHe shook his head.",
    "What time was it when you found her Miss Leonides\n\nIt must have been five minutes past one.",
    "And your Nannie saw her going out about twenty minutes earlier who was the last person before that known to have been in the wash\nhouse\n\nIve no idea.",
    "Probably Josephine herself.",
    "Josephine was swinging on\nthe door this morning after breakfast I know.",
    "Taverner nodded.",
    "So between then and a quarter to one someone set the trap.",
    "You say\nthat bit of marble is the door stop you use for the front door Any idea\nwhen that was missing\n\nSophia shook her head.",
    "The door hasnt been propped open at all today.",
    "Its been too cold.",
    "Any idea where everyone was all the morning\n\nI went out for a walk.",
    "Eustace and Josephine did lessons until half\npast twelve  with a break at half past ten.",
    "Father I think has been in\nthe library all the morning.",
    "Your mother\n\nShe was just coming out of her bedroom when I came in from my walk\n that was about a quarter past twelve.",
    "She doesnt get up very early.",
    "We reentered the house.",
    "I followed Sophia to the library.",
    "Philip\nlooking white and haggard sat in his usual chair.",
    "Magda crouched\nagainst his knees crying quietly.",
    "Sophia asked\n\nHave they telephoned yet from the hospital\n\nPhilip shook his head.",
    "Magda sobbed\n\nWhy wouldnt they let me go with her My baby  my funny ugly baby.",
    "And I used to call her a changeling and make her so angry.",
    "How could I\nbe so cruel And now shell die.",
    "I know shell die.",
    "Hush my dear said Philip.",
    "Hush.",
    "I felt that I had no place in this family scene of anxiety and grief.",
    "I\nwithdrew quietly and went to find Nannie.",
    "She was sitting in the\nkitchen crying quietly.",
    "Its a judgement on me Mr Charles for the hard things Ive been\nthinking.",
    "A judgement thats what it is.",
    "I did not try and fathom her meaning.",
    "Theres wickedness in this\nhouse.",
    "Thats what there is.",
    "I didnt wish to see it or believe it.",
    "But\nseeings believing.",
    "Somebody killed the master and the same\nsomebody must have tried to kill Josephine.",
    "Why should they try and kill Josephine\n\nNannie removed a corner of her handkerchief from her eye and gave\nme a shrewd glance.",
    "You know well enough what she was like Mr Charles.",
    "She liked to\nknow things.",
    "She was always like that even as a tiny thing.",
    "Used to\nhide under the dinner table and listen to the maids talking and then\nshed hold it over them.",
    "Made her feel important.",
    "You see she was\npassed over as it were by the mistress.",
    "She wasnt a handsome child\nlike the other two.",
    "She was always a plain little thing.",
    "A changeling the\nmistress used to call her.",
    "I blame the mistress for that for its my belief\nit turned the child sour.",
    "But in a funny sort of way she got her own back\nby finding out things about people and letting them know she knew\nthem.",
    "But it isnt safe to do that when theres a poisoner about\n\nNo it hadnt been safe.",
    "And that brought something else to my mind.",
    "I\nasked Nannie\n\nDo you know where she kept a little black book  a notebook of some\nkind where she used to write down things\n\n\fI know what you mean Mr Charles.",
    "Very sly about it she was.",
    "Ive\nseen her sucking her pencil and writing in the book and sucking her\npencil again.",
    "And dont do that Id say youll get lead poisoning and\noh no I shant she said because it isnt really lead in a pencil.",
    "Its\ncarbon though I dont see how that could be so for if you call a thing a\nlead pencil it stands to reason that thats because theres lead in it.",
    "Youd think so I agreed.",
    "But as a matter of fact she was right.",
    "Josephine was always right What about this notebook Do you\nknow where she kept it\n\nIve no idea at all sir.",
    "It was one of the things she was sly about.",
    "She hadnt got it with her when she was found\n\nOh no Mr Charles there was no notebook.",
    "Had someone taken the notebook Or had she hidden it in her own\nroom The idea came to me to look and see.",
    "I was not sure which\nJosephines room was but as I stood hesitating in the passage\nTaverners voice called me\n\nCome in here he said.",
    "Im in the kids room.",
    "Did you ever see such a\nsight\n\nI stepped over the threshold and stopped dead.",
    "The small room looked as though it had been visited by a tornado.",
    "The\ndrawers of the chest of drawers were pulled out and their contents\n\n\fscattered on the floor.",
    "The mattress and bedding had been pulled from\nthe small bed.",
    "The rugs were tossed into heaps.",
    "The chairs had been\nturned upside down the pictures taken down from the wall the\nphotographs wrenched out of their frames.",
    "Good Lord I exclaimed.",
    "What was the big idea\n\nWhat do you think\n\nSomeone was looking for something.",
    "Exactly.",
    "I looked round and whistled.",
    "But who on earth  Surely nobody could come in here and do all this\nand not be heard  or seen\n\nWhy not Mrs Leonides spends the morning in her bedroom doing her\nnails and ringing up her friends on the telephone and playing with her\nclothes.",
    "Philip sits in the library browsing over books.",
    "The nurse\nwoman is in the kitchen peeling potatoes and stringing beans.",
    "In a\nfamily that knows each others habits it would be easy enough.",
    "And Ill\ntell you this.",
    "Anyone in the house could have done our little job  could\nhave set the trap for the child and wrecked her room.",
    "But it was\nsomeone in a hurry someone who hadnt the time to search quietly.",
    "Anyone in the house you say\n\n\fYes Ive checked up.",
    "Everyone has some time or other unaccounted\nfor.",
    "Philip Magda the nurse your girl.",
    "The same upstairs.",
    "Brenda\nspent most of the morning alone.",
    "Laurence and Eustace had a half\nhour break  from tenthirty to eleven  you were with them part of that\ntime  but not all of it.",
    "Miss de Haviland was in the garden alone.",
    "Roger\nwas in his study.",
    "Only Clemency was in London at her job.",
    "No even she isnt out of it.",
    "She stayed at home today with a headache\n she was alone in her room having that headache.",
    "Any of them  any\nblinking one of them And I dont know which Ive no idea.",
    "If I knew\nwhat they were looking for in here \n\nHis eyes went round the wrecked room.",
    "And if I knew whether theyd found it...\n\nSomething stirred in my brain  a memory...\n\nTaverner clinched it by asking me\n\nWhat was the kid doing when you last saw her\n\nWait I said.",
    "I dashed out of the room and up the stairs.",
    "I passed through the left\nhand door and went up to the top floor.",
    "I pushed open the door of the\ncistern room mounted the two steps and bending my head since the\nceiling was low and sloping I looked round me.",
    "Josephine had said when I asked her what she was doing there that\nshe was detecting.",
    "I didnt see what there could be to detect in a cobwebby attic full of\nwater tanks.",
    "But such an attic would make a good hiding place.",
    "I\nconsidered it probable that Josephine had been hiding something\nthere something that she knew quite well she had no business to\nhave.",
    "If so it oughtnt to take long to find it.",
    "It took me just three minutes.",
    "Tucked away behind the largest tank\nfrom the interior of which a sibilant hissing added an eerie note to the\natmosphere I found a packet of letters wrapped in a torn piece of\nbrown paper.",
    "I read the first letter.",
    "Oh Laurence  my darling my own dear love...",
    "It was wonderful last\nnight when you quoted that verse of poetry  it was meant for me\nthough you didnt look at me.",
    "Aristide said You read verse well.",
    "He\ndidnt guess what we were both feeling.",
    "My darling I feel convinced\nthat soon everything will come right.",
    "We shall be glad that he never\nknew that he died happy.",
    "Hes been good to me.",
    "I dont want him to\nsuffer.",
    "But I dont really think that it can be any pleasure to live after\nyoure eighty.",
    "I shouldnt want to Soon we shall be together for\nalways.",
    "How wonderful it will be when I can say to you My dear dear\nhusband... Dearest we were made for each other.",
    "I love you love you\nlove you  I can see no end to our love I \n\nThere was a good deal more but I had no wish to go on.",
    "Grimly I went downstairs and thrust my parcel into Taverners hands.",
    "Its possible I said that thats what our unknown friend was looking\nfor.",
    "Taverner read a few passages whistled and shuffled through the\nvarious letters.",
    "Then he looked at me with the expression of a cat who has been fed\nwith the best cream.",
    "Well he said softly.",
    "This pretty well cooks Mrs Brenda Leonidess\ngoose.",
    "And Mr Laurence Browns.",
    "So it was them all the time...\n\nChapter 19\n\nIt seems odd to me looking back how suddenly and completely my\npity and sympathy for Brenda Leonides vanished with the discovery of\nher letters the letters she had written to Laurence Brown.",
    "Was my\nvanity unable to stand up to the revelation that she loved Laurence\nBrown with a doting and sugarly infatuation and had deliberately lied\nto me I dont know.",
    "Im not a psychologist.",
    "I prefer to believe that it\nwas the thought of the child Josephine struck down in ruthless self\npreservation that dried up the springs of my sympathy.",
    "Brown fixed that booby trap if you ask me said Taverner and it\nexplains what puzzled me about it.",
    "What did puzzle you\n\nWell it was such a sappy thing to do.",
    "Look here say the kids got hold\nof these letters  letters that are absolutely damning The first thing to\ndo is to try and get them back  after all if the kid talks about them\nbut has got nothing to show it can be put down as mere romancing\nbut you cant get them back because you cant find them.",
    "Then the only\nthing to do is to put the kid out of action for good.",
    "Youve done one\nmurder and youre not squeamish about doing another.",
    "You know\nshes fond of swinging on a door in a disused yard.",
    "The ideal thing to\ndo is wait behind the door and lay her out as she comes through with a\npoker or an iron bar or a nice bit of hosepipe.",
    "Theyre all there ready\nto hand.",
    "Why fiddle about with a marble lion perched on top of a door\nwhich is as likely as not to miss her altogether and which even if it\ndoes fall on her may not do the job properly which actually is how it\nturns out I ask you  why\n\nWell I said whats the answer\n\nThe only idea I got to begin with was that it was intended to tie in with\nsomeones alibi.",
    "Somebody would have a nice fat alibi for the time\nwhen Josephine was being slugged.",
    "But that doesnt wash because to\nbegin with nobody seems to have any kind of alibi and secondly\nsomeones bound to look for the child at lunchtime and theyll find the\nbooby trap and the marble block  the whole modus operandi will be\nquite plain to see.",
    "Of course if the murderer removed the block before\nthe child was found then we might have been puzzled.",
    "But as it is the\nwhole thing just dont make sense.",
    "He stretched out his hands...\n\nAnd whats your present explanation\n\nThe personal element.",
    "Personal idiosincrasy.",
    "Laurence Browns\nidiosyncrasy  he doesnt like violence  he cant force himself to do\nphysical violence.",
    "He couldnt have stood behind the door and socked\nthe kid on the head.",
    "He could have put up a booby trap and go away\nand not see it happen.",
    "Yes I see I said slowly.",
    "Its the eserine in the insulin bottle all over\nagain.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Do you think he did that with Brendas knowing\n\nIt would explain why she didnt throw away the insulin bottle.",
    "Of\ncourse they may have fixed it up between themselves she may have\nthought up the poison trick all by herself  a nice easy death for her\ntired old husband and all for the best in the best of possible worlds\nBut I bet she didnt fix the booby trap.",
    "Women never have any faith in\nmechanical things working properly.",
    "And are they right.",
    "I think myself\nthe eserine was her idea but that she made her besotted slave do the\nswitch.",
    "Shes the kind that usually manages to avoid doing anything\nequivocable themselves.",
    "Then they keep a nice happy conscience.",
    "He paused then went on\n\n\fWith these letters I think the D.P.P.",
    "will say we have a case.",
    "Theyll\ntake a bit of explaining away Then if the kid gets through all right\neverything in the garden will be lovely.",
    "He gave me a sideways\nglance.",
    "How does it feel to be engaged to about a million pounds\nsterling\n\nI winced.",
    "In the excitement of the last few hours I had forgotten the\ndevelopments about the will.",
    "Sophia doesnt know yet I said.",
    "Do you want me to tell her\n\nI understand Gaitskill is going to break the sad or glad news after\nthe\n\ninquest\n\ntomorrow.",
    "Taverner\n\npaused\n\nand\n\nlooked\n\nat\n\nme\n\nthoughtfully.",
    "I wonder he said what the reactions will be from the family\n\nChapter 20\n\nThe inquest went off much as I had prophesied.",
    "It was adjourned at the\nrequest of the police.",
    "We were in good spirits for news had come through the night before\nfrom the hospital that Josephines injuries were much less serious\nthan had been feared and that her recovery would be rapid.",
    "For the\nmoment Dr Gray said she was to be allowed no visitors  not even her\nmother.",
    "Particularly not her mother Sophia murmured to me.",
    "I made that\nquite clear to Dr Gray.",
    "Anyway he knows Mother.",
    "I must have looked rather doubtful for Sophia said sharply\n\nWhy the disapproving look\n\nWell  surely a mother \n\nIm glad youve got a few nice old fashioned ideas Charles.",
    "But you\ndont quite know what my mother is capable of yet.",
    "The darling cant\nhelp it but there would simply have to be a grand dramatic scene.",
    "And\ndramatic scenes arent the best things for anyone recovering from\nhead injuries.",
    "You do think of everything dont you my sweet.",
    "Well somebodys got to do the thinking now that grandfathers gone.",
    "I looked at her speculatively.",
    "I saw that old Leonidess acumen had not\ndeserted him.",
    "The mantle of his responsibilities was already on\nSophias shoulders.",
    "After the inquest Gaitskill accompanied us back to Three Gables.",
    "He\ncleared his throat and said pontifically\n\nThere is an announcement it is my duty to make to you all.",
    "For this purpose the family assembled in Magdas drawing room.",
    "I had\non this occasion the rather pleasurable sensations of the man behind\nthe scenes.",
    "I knew in advance what Gaitskill had to say.",
    "I prepared myself to observe the reactions of everyone.",
    "Gaitskill was brief and dry.",
    "Any signs of personal feeling and\nannoyance were well held in check.",
    "He read first Aristide Leonidess\nletter and then the will itself.",
    "It was very interesting to watch.",
    "I only\nwished my eyes could be everywhere at once.",
    "I did not pay much attention to Brenda and Laurence.",
    "The provision for\nBrenda in this will was the same.",
    "I watched primarily Roger and Philip\nand after them Magda and Clemency.",
    "My first impression was that they all behaved very well.",
    "Philips lips were pressed closely together his handsome head was\nthrown back against the tall chair in which he was sitting.",
    "He did not\nspeak.",
    "Magda on the contrary burst into speech as soon as Mr Gaitskill\nfinished her rich voice surging over his thin tones like an incoming\ntide drowning a rivulet.",
    "Darling Sophia  how extraordinary... How romantic...",
    "Fancy old\nSweetie Pie being so cunning and deceitful  just like a dear old baby.",
    "Didnt he trust us Did he think wed be cross He never seemed to be\nfonder of Sophia than of the rest of us.",
    "But really its most dramatic.",
    "Suddenly Magda jumped lightly to her feet danced over to Sophia and\nswept her a very grand court curtsey.",
    "Madame Sophia your penniless and broken down old mother begs\nyou for alms.",
    "Her voice took on a cockney whine.",
    "Spare us a copper old dear.",
    "Your Ma wants to go to the pictures.",
    "Her hand crooked into a claw twitched urgently at Sophia.",
    "Philip without moving said through stiff lips\n\nPlease Magda theres no call for any unnecessary clowning.",
    "Oh but Roger cried Magda suddenly turning to Roger.",
    "Poor\ndarling Roger.",
    "Sweetie was going to come to the rescue and then\nbefore he could do it he died.",
    "And now Roger doesnt get anything.",
    "Sophia she turned imperiously you simply must do something about\nRoger.",
    "No said Clemency.",
    "She had moved forward a step.",
    "Her face was\ndefiant.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "Roger came shambling over to Sophia like a large amiable bear.",
    "He took her hands affectionately.",
    "I dont want a penny my dear girl.",
    "As soon as this business is cleared\nup  or has died down which is more what it looks like  then Clemency\nand I are off to the West Indies and the simple life.",
    "If Im ever in\n\n\fextremis Ill apply to the head of the family  he grinned at her\nendearingly  but until then I dont want a penny.",
    "Im a very simple\nperson really my dear  you ask Clemency if Im not.",
    "An unexpected voice broke in.",
    "It was Edith de Havilands.",
    "Thats all very well she said.",
    "But youve to pay some attention to the\nlook of the thing.",
    "If you go bankrupt Roger and then slink off to the\nends of the earth without Sophias holding out a helping hand there\nwill be a good deal of ill natured talk that will not be pleasant for\nSophia.",
    "What does public opinion matter asked Clemency scornfully.",
    "We know it doesnt to you.",
    "Clemency said Edith de Haviland sharply\nbut Sophia lives in this world.",
    "Shes a girl with good brains and a good\nheart and Ive no doubt that Aristide was quite right in his selection of\nher to hold the family fortunes  though to pass over your two sons in\ntheir lifetime seems odd to our English ideas  but I think it would be\nvery unfortunate if it got about that she behaved greedily over this and had let Roger crash without trying to help him.",
    "Roger went over to his aunt.",
    "He put his arms round her and hugged\nher.",
    "Aunt Edith he said.",
    "You are a darling  and a stubborn fighter but\nyou dont begin to understand.",
    "Clemency and I know what we want and what we dont want\n\n\fClemency a sudden spot of colour showing in each thin cheek stood\ndefiantly facing them.",
    "None of you she said understand Roger.",
    "You never have I dont\nsuppose you ever will Come on Roger.",
    "They left the room as Mr Gaitskill began clearing his throat and\narranging\n\nhis\n\npapers.",
    "His\n\ncountenance\n\nwas\n\none\n\nof\n\ndeep\n\ndisapprobation.",
    "He disliked the foregoing scenes very much.",
    "That was clear.",
    "My eyes came at last to Sophia herself.",
    "She stood straight and\nhandsome by the fireplace her chin up her eyes steady.",
    "She had just\nbeen left an immense fortune but my principal thought was how alone\nshe had suddenly become.",
    "Between her and her family a barrier had\nbeen erected.",

    "Old Leonides had laid a\nburden upon her shoulders  he had been aware of that and she knew\nit herself.",
    "He had believed that her shoulders were strong enough to\nbear it but just at this moment I felt unutterably sorry for her.",
    "So far she had not spoken  indeed she had been given no chance but\nvery soon now speech would be forced from her.",
    "Already beneath the affection of her family I could sense latent\nhostility.",
    "Even in Magdas graceful playacting there had been I\nfancied a subtle malice.",

    "Mr Gaitskills throat clearings gave way to precise and measured\nspeech.",

    "He\nisnt a businessman.",
    "Never will be.",
    "He looked at Sophia.",
    "If you put\nAssociated Catering on its legs again dont be under any illusions that\nRoger can run it successfully.",

    "I laughed softly.",
    "I couldnt help it.",
    "What is it Sophia demanded suspiciously.",
    "Im beginning to understand why your grandfather left you his money.",
    "Youre a chip off the old block Sophia.",

    "Wrapped in her chinchilla\ncoat she had said If I dont get some air and  exercise I shall go mad.",
    "If I go outside the gate theres always a reporter waiting to pounce on\nme.",
    "Its like being besieged.",
    "Will it go on for ever\n\nSophia said that she supposed the reporters would soon get tired of it.",
    "You can go out in the car she added.",
    "I tell you I want to get some exercise.",
    "Then she said abruptly\n\nYouve given Laurence the sack Sophia.",
    "Why\n\nSophia answered quietly\n\n\fWere making other arrangements for Eustace.",
    "And Josephine is\ngoing to Switzerland.",
    "Well youve upset Laurence very much.",
    "He feels you dont trust him.",
    "Sophia did not reply and it was at that moment that Taverners car had\narrived.",
    "Standing there shivering in the moist autumn air Brenda muttered\nWhat do they want Why have they come\n\nI thought I knew why they had come.",
    "I had said nothing to Sophia of the\nletters I had found by the cistern but I knew that they had gone to the\nDirector of Public Prosecutions.",
    "Taverner came out of the house again.",
    "He walked across the drive and\nthe lawn towards us.",
    "Brenda shivered more violently.",
    "What does he want she repeated nervously.",
    "What does he want\n\nThen Taverner was with us.",

    "Dont let them take me\naway.",
    "It isnt true I tell you...",
    "It isnt true...",
    "I havent done anything...",
    "It was horrible  unbelievably horrible.",
    "I tried to soothe her I\nunfastened her fingers from my arm.",
    "I told her that I would arrange for\na lawyer for her  that she was to keep calm  that a lawyer would\narrange everything...\n\nTaverner took her gently under the elbow.",
    "Come along Mrs Leonides he said.",
    "You dont want a hat do you\nNo Then well go off right away.",
    "She pulled back staring at him with enormous cats eyes.",
    "Laurence she said.",
    "What have you done to Laurence\n\nMr Laurence Brown is also under arrest said Taverner.",
    "She wilted then.",

    "I know.",
    "You must get her a really first class solicitor  the best there is.",
    "She she must have all the help possible.",
    "One doesnt realise I said what these things are like.",
    "Ive never\nseen anyone arrested before.",
    "I know.",
    "One has no idea.",
    "We were both silent.",
    "I was thinking of the desperate terror on Brendas\nface.",
    "It had seemed familiar to me and suddenly I realised why.",
    "It was\nthe same expression that I had seen on Magda Leonidess face the first\nday I had come to the Crooked House when she had been talking about\nthe Edith Thompson play.",
    "And then she had said sheer terror dont you think so\n\nSheer terror  that was what had been on Brendas face.",
    "Brenda was\nnot a fighter.",
    "I wondered that she had ever had the nerve to do murder.",
    "But possibly\nshe had not.",
    "Possibly it had been Laurence Brown with his persecution mania his\nunstable personality who had put the contents of one little bottle into\nanother little bottle  a simple easy act  to free the woman he loved.",
    "So its over said Sophia.",
    "She sighed deeply then asked\n\nBut why arrest them now I thought there wasnt enough evidence.",
    "A certain amount of evidence has come to light.",
    "Letters.",
    "You mean love letters between them\n\nYes.",
    "What fools people are to keep these things\n\nYes indeed.",
    "Fools.",
    "The kind of folly which never seemed to profit by\nthe experience of others.",
    "You couldnt open a daily newspaper without\ncoming across some instance of that folly  the passion to keep the\nwritten word the written assurance of love.",
    "Its quite beastly Sophia I said.",
    "But its no good minding about it.",
    "After all its what weve been hoping all along isnt it Its what you\nsaid that first night at Marios.",
    "You said it would be all right if the right\nperson had killed your grandfather.",
    "Brenda was the right person\nwasnt she Brenda or Laurence\n\nDont.",
    "Charles you make me feel awful.",
    "But we must be sensible.",
    "We can marry now Sophia.",
    "You cant hold\nme off any longer.",
    "The Leonides family are out of it.",
    "She stared at me.",
    "I had never realised before the vivid blue of her\neyes.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "I suppose were out of it now.",
    "We are out of it arent\nwe Youre sure\n\nMy dear girl none of you really had a shadow of motive.",
    "Her face went suddenly white.",
    "Except me Charles.",
    "I had a motive.",
    "Yes of course  I was taken aback.",
    "But not really.",
    "You didnt know\nyou see about the will.",
    "But I did Charles she whispered.",
    "What I stared at her.",
    "I felt suddenly cold.",
    "I knew all the time that grandfather had left his money to me.",
    "But how\n\nHe told me.",
    "About a fortnight before he was killed.",
    "He said to me quite\nsuddenly Ive left all my money to you Sophia.",
    "You must look after the\nfamily when Im gone.",
    "I stared.",
    "You never told me.",
    "No.",
    "You see when they all explained about the will and his signing it I\nthought perhaps he had made a mistake  that he was just imagining\nthat he had left it to me.",
    "Or that if he had made a will leaving it to me\nthen it had got lost and would never turn up.",
    "I didnt want it to turn up I was afraid.",
    "Afraid Why\n\nI suppose  because of murder.",
    "I remembered the look of terror on Brendas face  the wild\nunreasoning panic.",
    "I remembered the sheer panic that Magda had conjured up at will\nwhen she considered playing the part of a murderess.",
    "There would be\nno panic in Sophias mind but she was a realist and she could see\nclearly enough that Leonidess will made her a suspect.",
    "I understood\nbetter now or thought I did her refusal to become engaged to me and\nher insistence that I should find out the truth.",
    "Nothing but the truth\nshe had said was any good to her.",
    "I remembered the passion the\nearnestness with which she had said it.",
    "We had turned to walk towards the house and suddenly at a certain\nspot I remembered something else she had said.",
    "She had said that she supposed she could murder someone but if so\nshe had added it must be for something really worth while.",
    "Chapter 22\n\nRound a turn of the rock garden Roger and Clemency came walking\nbriskly towards us.",
    "Rogers flapping tweeds suited him better than his\nCity clothes.",
    "He looked eager and excited.",
    "Clemency was frowning.",
    "Hullo you two said Roger.",
    "At last I thought they were never going\nto arrest that foul woman.",
    "What theyve been waiting for I dont know.",
    "Well theyve pinched her now and her miserable boy friend  and I\nhope they hang them both.",
    "Clemencys frown increased.",
    "She said Dont be so uncivilised\nRoger.",
    "Uncivilised Bosh Deliberate coldblooded poisoning of a helpless\ntrusting old man  and when Im glad the murderers are caught and will\npay the penalty you say Im uncivilised I tell you Id willingly strangle\nthat woman myself.",
    "He added\n\nShe was with you wasnt she when the police came for her How did\nshe take it\n\nIt was horrible said Sophia in a low voice.",
    "She was scared out of\nher wits.",
    "Serves her right.",
    "Dont be vindictive said Clemency.",
    "Oh I know dearest but you cant understand.",
    "It wasnt your father.",
    "I\nloved my father.",
    "Dont you understand I loved him\n\nI should understand by now said Clemency.",
    "Roger said to her half jokingly\n\nYouve no imagination.",
    "Clemency.",
    "Suppose it had been I who had\nbeen poisoned\n\nI saw the quick droop of her lids her halfclenched hands.",
    "She said\nsharply\n\nDont say things like that even in fun.",
    "Never mind darling well soon be away from all this.",
    "We moved towards the house.",
    "Roger and Sophia walked ahead and\nClemency and I brought up the rear.",
    "She said\n\nI suppose now  theyll let us go\n\nAre you so anxious to get off I asked.",
    "It s wearing me out.",
    "I looked at her in surprise.",
    "She met my glance with a faint desperate\nsmile and a nod of the head.",
    "Havent you seen Charles that Im fighting all the time Fighting for\nmy happiness.",
    "For Rogers.",
    "Ive been so afraid the family would\npersuade him to stop in England.",
    "That wed go on tangled up in the\nmidst of them stifled with family ties.",
    "I was afraid Sophia would offer\nhim an home and that hed stay in England because it would mean\ngreater comfort and amenities for me.",
    "The trouble with Roger is that\nhe will not listen.",
    "He gets ideas in his head  and theyre never the right\nideas.",
    "He doesnt know anything.",
    "And hes enough of a Leonides to\nthink that happiness for a woman is bound up with comfort and money.",
    "But I will fight for my happiness  I will.",
    "I will get Roger away and give\nhim the life that suits him where he wont feel a failure.",
    "I want him to\nmyself  away from them all  right away...\n\nShe had spoken in a low hurried voice with a kind of desperation that\nstartled me.",
    "I had not realised how much on edge she was.",
    "I had not realised\neither quite how desperate and possessive was her feeling for Roger.",
    "It brought back to my mind that odd quotation of Edith de Havilands.",
    "She had quoted the line this side of idolatry with a peculiar\nintonation.",
    "I wondered if she had been thinking of Clemency.",
    "Roger I thought had loved his father better than he would ever love\nanyone else better even than his wife devoted though he was to her.",
    "I\nrealised for the first time how urgent was Clemencys desire to get her\n\n\fhusband to herself.",
    "Love for Roger I saw made up her entire\nexistence.",
    "He was her child as well as her husband and her lover.",
    "A car drove up to the front door.",
    "Hullo I said.",
    "Heres Josephine back.",
    "Josephine and Magda got out of the car.",
    "Josephine had a bandage round her head but otherwise looked\nremarkably well.",
    "She said at once\n\nI want to see my goldfish and started towards us and the pond.",
    "Darling cried Magda youd better come in first and lie down a little\nand perhaps have a little nourishing soup.",
    "Dont fuss mother said Josephine.",
    "Im quite all right and I hate\nnourishing soup.",
    "Magda looked irresolute.",
    "I knew that Josephine had really been fit to\ndepart from the hospital for some days and that it was only a hint from\nTaverner that had kept her there.",
    "He was taking no chances on\nJosephines safety until his suspects were safe under lock and key.",
    "I said to Magda\n\nI daresay fresh air will do her good.",
    "Ill go and keep an eye on her.",
    "I caught Josephine up before she got to the pond.",
    "All sorts of things have been happening while youve been away I\nsaid.",
    "Josephine did not reply.",
    "She peered with her shortsighted eyes into\nthe pond.",
    "I dont see Ferdinand she said.",
    "Which is Ferdinand\n\nThe one with four tails.",
    "That kind is rather amusing.",
    "I like that bright gold one.",
    "Its quite a common one.",
    "I dont much care for that motheaten white one.",
    "Josephine cast me a scornful glance.",
    "Thats a shebunkin.",
    "They cost a lot  far more than goldfish.",
    "Dont you want to hear whats been happening Josephine\n\nI expect I know about it.",
    "Did you know that another will has been found and that your\ngrandfather left all his money to Sophia\n\nJosephine nodded in a bored kind of way.",
    "Mother told me.",
    "Anyway I knew it already.",
    "Do you mean you heard it in the hospital\n\nNo I mean I knew that grandfather had left his money to Sophia.",
    "I\nheard him tell her so.",
    "Were you listening again\n\nYes.",
    "I like listening.",
    "Its a disgraceful thing to do and remember this listeners hear no\ngood of themselves.",
    "Josephine gave me a peculiar glance.",
    "I heard what he said about me to her if thats what you mean.",
    "She added\n\nNannie gets wild if she catches me listening at doors.",
    "She says its not\nthe sort of thing a little lady does.",
    "Shes quite right.",
    "Pooh said Josephine.",
    "Nobodys a lady nowadays.",
    "They say so on\nthe Brains Trust.",
    "They said it was  obsolete.",
    "She pronounced the\nword carefully.",
    "I changed the subject.",
    "Youve got home a bit late for the big event I said.",
    "Chief Inspector\nTaverner has arrested Brenda and Laurence.",
    "I expected that Josephine in her character of young detective would\nbe thrilled by this information but she merely repeated in her\nmaddening bored fashion\n\nYes I know.",
    "You cant know.",
    "Its only just happened.",
    "The car passed us on the road.",
    "Inspector Taverner and the detective\nwith the suede shoes were inside with Brenda and Laurence so of\ncourse I knew they must have been arrested.",
    "I hope he gave them the\nproper caution.",
    "You have to you know.",
    "I assured her that Taverner had acted strictly according to etiquette.",
    "I had to tell him about the letters I said apologetically.",
    "I found them\nbehind the cistern.",
    "Id have let you tell him only you were knocked\nout.",
    "Josephines hand went gingerly to her head.",
    "I ought to have been killed she said with complacency.",
    "I told you it\nwas about the time for the second murder.",
    "The cistern was a rotten\nplace to hide those letters.",
    "I guessed at once when I saw Laurence\ncoming out of there one day.",
    "I mean hes not a useful kind of man who\ndoes things with ball taps or pipes or fuses so I knew he must have\nbeen hiding something.",
    "But I thought  I broke off as Edith de Havilands voice called\nauthoritatively\n\nJosephine.",
    "Josephine come here at once.",
    "Josephine sighed.",
    "More fuss she said.",
    "But Id better go.",
    "You have to if its Aunt Edith.",
    "She ran across the lawn.",
    "I followed more slowly.",
    "After a brief interchange of words Josephine went into the house.",
    "I\njoined Edith de Haviland on the terrace.",
    "This morning she looked fully her age.",
    "I was startled by the lines of\nweariness and suffering on her face.",
    "She looked exhausted and\ndefeated.",
    "She saw the concern in my face and tried to smile.",
    "That child seems none the worse for her adventure she said.",
    "We\nmust look after her better in future.",
    "Still  I suppose now it wont be\nnecessary\n\nShe sighed and said\n\n\fIm glad its over.",
    "But what an exhibition.",
    "If you are arrested for\nmurder you might at least have some dignity.",
    "Ive no patience with\npeople like Brenda who go to pieces and squeal.",
    "No guts these\npeople.",
    "Laurence Brown looked like a cornered rabbit.",
    "An obscure instinct of pity rose in me.",
    "Poor devils I said.",
    "Yes  poor devils.",
    "Shell have the sense to look after herself I\nsuppose I mean the right lawyers  all that sort of thing.",
    "It was queer I thought the dislike they all had for Brenda and their\nscrupulous care for her to have all the advantages for defence.",
    "Edith de Haviland went on\n\nHow long will it be How long will the whole thing take\n\nI said I didnt know exactly.",
    "They would be charged at the police court\nand presumably sent for trial.",
    "Three or four months I estimated  and if\nconvicted there would be the appeal.",
    "Do you think they will be convicted she asked.",
    "I dont know.",
    "I dont know exactly how much evidence the police have.",
    "There are letters.",
    "Love letters They were lovers then\n\n\fThey were in love with each other.",
    "Her face grew grimmer.",
    "Im not happy about this Charles.",
    "I dont like Brenda.",
    "In the past Ive\ndisliked her very much.",
    "Ive said sharp things about her.",
    "But now  I do\nfeel that I want her to have every chance  every possible chance.",
    "Aristide would have wished that.",
    "I feel its up to me to see that  that\nBrenda gets a square deal.",
    "And Laurence\n\nOh Laurence she shrugged her shoulders impatiently.",
    "Men must\nlook after themselves.",
    "But Aristide would never forgive us if  She left\nthe sentence unfinished.",
    "Then she said\n\nIt must be almost lunch time.",
    "Wed better go in.",
    "I explained that I was going up to London.",
    "In your car\n\nYes.",
    "Hm.",
    "I wonder if youd take me with you.",
    "I gather were allowed off the\nlead now.",
    "Of course I will but I believe Magda and Sophia are going up after\nlunch.",
    "Youll be more comfortable with them than in my two seater.",
    "I dont want to go with them.",
    "Take me with you and dont say much\nabout it.",
    "I was surprised but I did as she asked.",
    "We did not speak much on the way to town.",
    "I asked her where I should\nput her down.",
    "Harley Street.",
    "I felt some faint apprehension but I didnt like to say anything.",
    "She\ncontinued\n\nNo its too early.",
    "Drop me at Debenhams.",
    "I can have some lunch\nthere and go to Harley Street afterwards.",
    "I hope  I began and stopped.",
    "Thats why I didnt want to go up with Magda.",
    "She dramatizes things.",
    "Lot of fuss.",
    "Im very sorry I said.",
    "You neednt be.",
    "Ive had a good life.",
    "A very good life.",
    "She gave a\nsudden grin.",
    "And its not over yet.",
    "Chapter 23\n\nI had not seen my father for some days.",
    "I found him busy with things\nother than the Leonides case and I went in search of Taverner.",
    "Taverner was enjoying a short spell of leisure and was willing to come\nout and have a drink with me.",
    "I congratulated him on having cleared up\nthe case and he accepted my congratulations but his manner\nremained far from jubilant.",
    "Well thats over he said.",
    "Weve got a case.",
    "Nobody can deny that\nweve got a case.",
    "Do you think youll get a conviction\n\nImpossible to say.",
    "The evidence is circumstantial  it nearly always is\nin a murder case  bound to be.",
    "A lot depends on the impression they\nmake on the jury.",
    "How far do the letters go\n\nAt first sight Charles theyre pretty damning.",
    "There are references\nto their life together when her husbands dead.",
    "Phrases like  it wont\nbe long now.",
    "Mind you defence counsel will try and twist it the other\nway  the husband was so old that of course they could reasonably\nexpect him to die.",
    "Theres no actual mention of poisoning  not down in\nblack or white  but there are some passages that could mean that.",
    "It\n\n\fdepends what judge we get.",
    "If its old Carberry hell be down on them\nall through.",
    "Hes always very righteous about illicit love.",
    "I suppose\ntheyll have Eagles or Humphrey Kerr for the defence  Humphrey is\nmagnificent in these cases  but he likes a gallant war record or\nsomething of that kind to help him do his stuff.",
    "A conscientious\nobjector is going to cramp his style.",
    "The question is going to be will the\njury like them You can never tell with juries.",
    "You know Charles those\ntwo are not really sympathetic characters.",
    "Shes a good looking\nwoman who married a very old man for his money and Brown is a\nneurotic conscientious objector.",
    "The crime is so familiar  so\naccording to pattern that you cant really believe they didnt do it.",
    "Of\ncourse they may decide that he did it and she knew nothing about it or alternatively that she did it and he didnt know about it  or they may\ndecide that they were both in it together.",
    "And what do you yourself think I asked.",
    "He looked at me with a wooden expressionless face.",
    "I dont think anything.",
    "Ive turned in the facts and they went to the\nD.P.P.",
    "and it was decided that there was a case.",
    "Thats all.",
    "Ive done\nmy duty and Im out of it.",
    "So now you know Charles.",
    "But I didnt know.",
    "I saw that for some reason Taverner was unhappy.",
    "It was not until three days later that I unburdened myself to my father.",
    "He himself had never mentioned the case to me.",
    "There had been a kind\nof restraint between us  and I thought I knew the reason for it.",
    "But I\nhad to break down that barrier.",
    "Weve got to have this out I said.",
    "Taverners not satisfied that those\ntwo did it  and youre not satisfied either.",
    "My father shook his head.",
    "He said what Taverner had said\n\nIts out of our hands.",
    "There is a case to answer.",
    "No question about\nthat.",
    "But you dont  Taverner doesnt  think that theyre guilty\n\nThats for a jury to decide.",
    "For Gods sake I said dont put me off with technical terms.",
    "What\ndo you think  both of you  personally\n\nMy personal opinion is no better than yours Charles.",
    "Yes it is.",
    "Youve more experience.",
    "Then Ill be honest with you.",
    "I just  dont know\n\nThey could be guilty\n\nOh yes.",
    "But you dont feel sure that they are\n\nMy father shrugged his shoulders.",
    "How can one be sure\n\n\fDont fence with me dad.",
    "Youve been sure other times havent you\nDead sure No doubt in your mind at all\n\nSometimes yes.",
    "Not always.",
    "I wish to God you were sure this time.",
    "So do I.",
    "We were silent.",
    "I was thinking of those two figures drifting in from the\ngarden in the dusk.",
    "Lonely and haunted and afraid.",
    "They had been\nafraid from the start.",
    "Didnt that show a guilty conscience\n\nBut I answered myself Not necessarily.",
    "Both Brenda and Laurence were afraid of life  they had no confidence\nin themselves in their ability to avoid danger and defeat and they\ncould see only too clearly the pattern of illicit love leading to murder\nwhich might involve them at any moment.",
    "My father spoke and his voice was grave and kind\n\nCome Charles he said lets face it.",
    "Youve still got it in your mind\nhavent you that one of the Leonides family is the real culprit\n\nNot really.",
    "I only wonder \n\nYou do think so.",
    "You may be wrong but you do think so.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "Why\n\nBecause  I thought about it trying to see clearly  to bring my wits to\nbear because yes that was it because they think so themselves.",
    "They think so themselves Thats interesting.",
    "Thats very interesting.",
    "Do you mean that they all suspect each other or that they know\nactually who did do it.",
    "Im not sure I said.",
    "Its all very nebulous and confused.",
    "I think  on\nthe whole  that they try to cover up the knowledge from themselves.",
    "My father nodded.",
    "Not Roger I said.",
    "Roger wholeheartedly believes it was Brenda and\nhe wholeheartedly wants her hanged.",
    "Its  its a relief to be with Roger\nbecause hes simple and positive and hasnt any reservations in the\nback of his mind.",
    "But the others are apologetic theyre uneasy  they urge me to be\nsure that Brenda has the best defence  that every possible advantage\nis given her  why\n\nMy father answered\n\nBecause they dont really in their hearts believe she is guilty...",
    "Yes\nthats sound.",
    "Then he asked quietly\n\n\fWho could have done it Youve talked to them all Whos the best\nbet\n\nI dont know I said.",
    "And its driving me frantic.",
    "None of them fits\nyour sketch of a murderer and yet I feel  I do feel  that one of them is\na murderer.",
    "Sophia\n\nNo.",
    "Good God no\n\nThe possibilitys in your mind Charles  yes it is dont deny it.",
    "All the\nmore potently because you wont acknowledge it.",
    "What about the\nothers Philip\n\nOnly for the most fantastic motive.",
    "Motives can be fantastic  or they can be absurdly slight.",
    "Whats his\nmotive\n\nHe is bitterly jealous of Roger  always has been all his life.",
    "His\nfathers preference for Roger drove Philip in upon himself.",
    "Roger was\nabout to crash then the old man heard of it.",
    "He promised to put Roger\non his feet again.",
    "Supposing Philip learnt that.",
    "If the old man died that\nnight there would be no assistance for Roger.",
    "Roger would be down\nand out.",
    "Oh I know its absurd \n\nOh no it isnt.",
    "Its abnormal but it happens.",
    "Its human.",
    "What about\nMagda\n\n\fShes rather childish.",
    "She  gets things out of proportion.",
    "But I would\nnever have thought twice about her being involved if it hadnt been for\nthe sudden way she wanted to pack Josephine off to Switzerland.",
    "I\ncouldnt help feeling she was afraid of something that Josephine knew\nor might say...\n\nAnd then Josephine was conked on the head\n\nWell that couldnt be her mother\n\nWhy not\n\nBut dad a mother wouldnt \n\nCharles Charles dont you ever read the police news.",
    "Again and\nagain a mother takes a dislike to one of her children.",
    "Only one  she\nmay be devoted to the others.",
    "Theres some association some reason\nbut its often hard to get at.",
    "But when it exists its an unreasoning\naversion and its very strong.",
    "She called Josephine a changeling I admitted unwillingly.",
    "Did the child mind\n\nI dont think so.",
    "Who else is there Roger\n\nRoger didnt kill his father.",
    "Im quite sure of that.",
    "Wash out Roger then.",
    "His wife  whats her name  Clemency\n\nYes I said.",
    "If she killed old Leonides it was for a very odd reason.",
    "I told him of my conversations with Clemency.",
    "I said I thought it\npossible that in her passion to get Roger away from England she might\nhave deliberately poisoned the old man.",
    "Shed persuaded Roger to go without telling his father.",
    "Then the old\nman found out.",
    "He was going to back up Associated Catering.",
    "All\nClemencys hopes and plans were frustrated.",
    "And she really does care\ndesperately for Roger  beyond idolatry.",
    "Youre repeating what Edith de Haviland said\n\nYes.",
    "And Ediths another who I think  might have done it.",
    "But I dont\nknow why.",
    "I can only believe that for what she considered good and\nsufficient reason she might take the law into her own hand.",
    "Shes that\nkind of a person.",
    "And she also was very anxious that Brenda should be adequately\ndefended\n\nYes.",
    "That I suppose might be conscience.",
    "I dont think for a moment\nthat if she did do it she intended them to be accused of the crime.",
    "Probably not.",
    "But would she knock out the child Josephine\n\n\fNo I said slowly I cant believe that.",
    "Which reminds me that theres\nsomething that Josephine said to me that keeps nagging at my mind\nand I cant remember what it is.",
    "Its slipped my memory.",
    "But its\nsomething that doesnt fit in where it should.",
    "If only I could remember \n\nNever mind.",
    "It will come back.",
    "Anything or anyone else on your\nmind\n\nYes I said.",
    "Very much so.",
    "How much do you know about infantile\nparalysis.",
    "Its after effects on character I mean\n\nEustace\n\nYes.",
    "The more I think about it the more it seems to me that Eustace\nmight fit the bill.",
    "His dislikes and resentment against his grandfather.",
    "His queerness and moodiness.",
    "Hes not normal.",
    "Hes the only one of\nthe family who I can see knocking out Josephine quite callously if she\nknew something about him  and shes quite likely to know.",
    "That child\nknows everything.",
    "She writes it down in a little book \n\nI stopped.",
    "Good Lord I said.",
    "What a fool I am.",
    "Whats the matter\n\nI know now what was wrong.",
    "We assumed Taverner and I that the\nwrecking of Josephines room the frantic search was for those\nletters.",
    "I thought that shed got hold of them and that shed hidden\n\n\fthem up in the cistern room.",
    "But when she was talking to me the other\nday she made it quite clear that it was Laurence who had hidden them\nthere.",
    "She saw him coming out of the cistern room and went snooping\naround and found the letters.",
    "Then of course she read them.",
    "She\nwould But she left them where they were.",
    "Well\n\nDont you see It couldnt have been the letters someone was looking\nfor in Josephines room.",
    "It must have been something else.",
    "And that something \n\nWas the little black book she writes down her detection in.",
    "Thats\nwhat someone was looking for I think too that whoever it was didnt\nfind it.",
    "I think Josephine has it.",
    "But if so \n\nI half rose.",
    "If so said my father she still isnt safe.",
    "Is that what you were going\nto say\n\nYes.",
    "She wont be out of danger until shes actually started for\nSwitzerland.",
    "Theyre planning to send her there you know.",
    "Does she want to go\n\nI considered.",
    "I dont think she does.",
    "Then she probably hasnt gone said my father drily.",
    "But I think\nyoure right about the danger.",
    "Youd better go down there.",
    "Eustace I cried desperately.",
    "Clemency\n\nMy father said gently\n\nTo my mind the facts point clearly in one direction...",
    "I wonder you\ndont see it yourself.",
    "I...\n\nGlover opened the door.",
    "Beg pardon Mr Charles the telephone.",
    "Miss Leonides speaking from\nSwinly.",
    "Its urgent.",
    "It seemed like a horrible repetition.",
    "Had Josephine again fallen a\nvictim.",
    "And had the murderer this time made no mistake\n\nI hurried to the telephone.",
    "Sophia Its Charles here.",
    "Sophias voice came with a kind of hard desperation in it.",
    "Charles it isnt all over.",
    "The murderer is still here.",
    "What on earth do you mean Whats wrong Is it  Josephine\n\nIts not Josephine.",
    "Its Nannie.",
    "Nannie\n\nYes there was some cocoa  Josephines cocoa she didnt drink it.",
    "She left it on the table.",
    "Nannie thought it was a pity to waste it.",
    "So she\ndrank it.",
    "Poor Nannie.",
    "Is she very bad\n\nSophias voice broke.",
    "Oh Charles shes dead.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nWe were back again in the nightmare.",
    "That is what I thought as Taverner and I drove out of London.",
    "It was a\nrepetition of our former journey.",
    "At intervals Taverner swore.",
    "As for me I repeated from time to time stupidly unprofitably\n\nSo it wasnt Brenda and Laurence.",
    "It wasnt Brenda and Laurence.",
    "Had I ever really thought it was I had been so glad to think it.",
    "So glad\nto escape from other more sinister possibilities...",
    "They had fallen in love with each other.",
    "They had written silly\nsentimental romantic letters to each other.",
    "They had indulged in hopes\nthat Brenda s old husband might soon die peacefully and happily  but\nI wondered really if they had even acutely desired his death.",
    "I had a\nfeeling that the despairs and longings of an unhappy love affair suited\nthem as well or better than commonplace married life together.",
    "I didnt\nthink Brenda was really passionate.",
    "She was too anaemic too\napathetic.",
    "It was romance she craved for.",
    "And I thought Laurence too\nwas the type to enjoy frustration and vague future dreams of bliss\nrather than the concrete satisfactions of the flesh.",
    "They had been caught in a trap and terrified they had not had the wit\nto find their way out.",
    "Laurence with incredible stupidity had not even\ndestroyed Brenda s letters.",
    "Presumably Brenda had destroyed his\nsince they had not been found.",
    "And it was not Laurence who had\nbalanced the marble door stop on the wash house door.",
    "It was someone else whose face was still hidden behind a mask.",
    "We drove up to the door.",
    "Taverner got out and I followed him.",
    "There\nwas a plain clothes man in the hall whom I didnt know.",
    "He saluted\nTaverner and Taverner drew him aside.",
    "My attention was taken by a pile of luggage in the hall.",
    "It was labelled\nand ready for departure.",
    "As I looked at it Clemency came down the\nstairs and through the open door at the bottom.",
    "She was dressed in\nher same red dress with a tweed coat over it and a red felt hat.",
    "Youre in time to say goodbye Charles she said.",
    "Youre leaving\n\nWe go to London tonight.",
    "Our plane goes early tomorrow morning.",
    "She was quiet and smiling but I thought her eyes were watchful.",
    "But surely you cant go now\n\nWhy not Her voice was hard.",
    "With this death \n\nNannies death has nothing to do with us.",
    "Perhaps not.",
    "But all the same \n\nWhy do you say perhaps not It has nothing to do with us.",
    "Roger and\nI have been upstairs finishing packing up.",
    "We did not come down at all\nduring the time that the cocoa was left on the hall table.",
    "Can you prove that\n\nI can answer for Roger.",
    "And Roger can answer for me.",
    "No more than that... Youre man and wife remember.",
    "Her anger flamed out.",
    "Youre impossible Charles Roger and I are going away  to lead our\nown life.",
    "Why on earth should we want to poison a nice stupid old\nwoman who had never done us any harm\n\nIt mightnt have been her you meant to poison.",
    "Still less are we likely to poison a child.",
    "It depends rather on the child doesnt it\n\nWhat do you mean\n\nJosephine isnt quite the ordinary child.",
    "She knows a good deal about\npeople.",
    "She \n\nI broke off.",
    "Josephine had emerged from the door leading to the\ndrawing room.",
    "She was eating the inevitable apple and over its round\nrosiness her eyes sparkled with a kind of ghoulish enjoyment.",
    "Nannies been poisoned she said.",
    "Just like grandfather.",
    "Its awfully\nexciting isnt it\n\nArent you at all upset about it I demanded severely.",
    "You were fond\nof her werent you\n\nNot particularly.",
    "She was always scolding me about something or\nother.",
    "She fussed.",
    "Are you fond of anybody Josephine asked Clemency.",
    "Josephine turned her ghoulish eyes towards Clemency.",
    "I love Aunt Edith she said.",
    "I love Aunt Edith very much.",
    "And I could\nlove Eustace only hes always such a beast to me and wont be\ninterested in finding out who did all this.",
    "Youd better stop finding things out Josephine I said.",
    "It isnt very\nsafe.",
    "I dont need to find out any more said Josephine.",
    "I know.",
    "There was a moments silence.",
    "Josephines eyes solemn and\nunwinking were fixed on Clemency.",
    "A sound like a long sigh reached\nmy ears.",
    "I swung sharply round.",
    "Edith de Haviland stood half way\ndown the staircase  but I did not think it was she who had sighed.",
    "The\nsound had come from behind the door through which Josephine had\njust come.",
    "I stepped sharply across to it and yanked it open.",
    "There was no one to\nbe seen.",
    "Nevertheless I was seriously disturbed.",
    "Someone had stood\njust within that door and had heard those words of Josephines.",
    "I went\nback and took Josephine by the arm.",
    "She was eating her apple and\nstaring stolidly at Clemency.",
    "Behind the solemnity there was I\nthought a certain malignant satisfaction.",
    "Come on Josephine I said.",
    "Were going to have a little talk.",
    "I think Josephine might have protested but I was not standing any\nnonsense.",
    "I ran her along forcibly into her own part of the house.",
    "There was a small unused morning room where we could be\n\n\freasonably sure of being undisturbed.",
    "I took her in there closed the\ndoor firmly and made her sit on a chair.",
    "I took another chair and drew\nit forward so that I faced her.",
    "Now Josephine I said were going to have a show down.",
    "What\nexactly do you know\n\nLots of things.",
    "That I have no doubt about.",
    "That noddle of yours is probably\ncrammed to overflowing with relevant and irrelevant information.",
    "But\nyou know perfectly what I mean.",
    "Dont you\n\nOf course I do.",
    "Im not stupid.",
    "I didnt know whether the disparagement was for me or the police but\nI paid no attention to it and went on\n\nYou know who put something in your cocoa\n\nJosephine nodded.",
    "You know who poisoned your grandfather\n\nJosephine nodded again.",
    "And who knocked you on the head\n\nAgain Josephine nodded.",
    "Then youre going to come across with what you know.",
    "Youre going\nto tell me all about it  now.",
    "Shant.",
    "Youve got to.",
    "Every bit of information youve got or ferret out has got\nto be given to the police.",
    "I wont tell the police anything.",
    "Theyre stupid.",
    "They thought Brenda\nhad done it  or Laurence.",
    "I wasnt stupid like that.",
    "I knew jolly well they\nhadnt done it.",
    "Ive had an idea who it was all along and then I made a\nkind of test  and now I know Im right.",
    "She finished on a triumphant note.",
    "I prayed to Heaven for patience and started again.",
    "Listen Josephine I daresay youre extremely clever  Josephine\nlooked gratified.",
    "But it wont be much good to you to be clever if\nyoure not alive to enjoy the fact.",
    "Dont you see you little fool that as\nlong as you keep your secrets in this silly way youre in imminent\ndanger\n\nJosephine nodded approvingly.",
    "Of course I am.",
    "Already youve had two very narrow escapes.",
    "One attempt nearly did\nfor you.",
    "The other has cost somebody else their life.",
    "Dont you see if\nyou go on strutting about the house and proclaiming at the top of your\n\n\fvoice you know who the killer is there will be more attempts made and that either youll die or somebody else will\n\nIn some books person after person is killed Josephine informed me\nwith gusto.",
    "You end by spotting the murderer because he or she is\npractically the only person left.",
    "This isnt a detective story.",
    "This is Three Gables Swinly Dean and\nyoure a silly little girl whos read more than is good for her.",
    "Ill make\nyou tell me what you know if I have to shake you till your teeth rattle.",
    "I could always tell you something that wasnt true.",
    "You could but you wont.",
    "What are you waiting for anyway\n\nYou dont understand said Josephine.",
    "Perhaps I may never tell.",
    "You\nsee I might be  fond of the person.",
    "She paused as though to let this sink in.",
    "And if I do tell she went on I shall do it properly.",
    "I shall have\neverybody sitting round and then Ill go over it all  with the clues and\nthen I shall say quite suddenly\n\nAnd it was you...\n\nShe thrust out a dramatic forefinger just as Edith de Haviland entered\nthe room.",
    "Put that core in the waste paper basket Josephine said Edith.",
    "Have you got a handkerchief Your fingers are sticky.",
    "Im taking you\nout in the car.",
    "Her eyes met mine with significance as she said Shell\nbe safer out of here for the next hour or so.",
    "As Josephine looked\nmutinous Edith added Well go into Longbridge and have an ice\ncream soda.",
    "Josephines eyes brightened and she said Two.",
    "Perhaps said Edith.",
    "Now go and get your hat and coat on and your\ndark blue scarf.",
    "Its cold out today.",
    "Charles you had better go with her\nwhile she gets them.",
    "Dont leave her.",
    "I have just a couple of notes to\nwrite.",
    "She sat down at the desk and I escorted Josephine out of the room.",
    "Even without Ediths warning I would have stuck to Josephine like a\nleech.",
    "I was convinced that there was danger to the child very near at hand.",
    "As I finished superintending Josephines toilet Sophia came into the\nroom.",
    "She seemed astonished to see me.",
    "Why Charles have you turned nursemaid I didnt know you were\nhere.",
    "Im going in to Longbridge with Aunt Edith said Josephine\nimportantly.",
    "Were going to have icecreams.",
    "Brrrr on a day like this\n\n\fIce cream sodas are always lovely said Josephine.",
    "When youre\ncold inside it makes you feel hotter outside.",
    "Sophia frowned.",
    "She looked worried and I was shocked by her pallor\nand the circles under her eyes.",
    "We went back to the morning room.",
    "Edith was just blotting a couple of envelopes.",
    "She got up briskly.",
    "Well start now she said.",
    "I told Evans to bring round the Ford.",
    "She swept out to the hall.",
    "We followed her.",
    "My eye was again caught by the suitcases and their blue labels.",
    "For\nsome reason they aroused in me a vague disquietude.",
    "Its quite a nice day said Edith de Haviland pulling on her gloves\nand glancing up at the sky.",
    "The Ford 10 was waiting in front of the\nhouse.",
    "Cold  but bracing.",
    "A real English autumn day.",
    "How beautiful\ntrees look with their bare branches against the sky  and just a golden\nleaf or two still hanging...\n\nShe was silent a moment or two then she turned and kissed Sophia.",
    "Goodbye dear she said.",
    "Dont worry too much.",
    "Certain things have\nto be faced and endured.",
    "Then she said Come Josephine and got into the car.",
    "Josephine\nclimbed in beside her.",
    "They both waved as the car drove off.",
    "I suppose shes right and its\nbetter to keep Josephine out of this for a while.",
    "But weve got to make\nthat child tell what she knows Sophia.",
    "She probably doesnt know anything.",
    "Shes just showing off.",
    "Josephine likes to make herself look important you know.",
    "Its more than that.",
    "Do they know what poison it was in the cocoa\n\nThey think its digitalin.",
    "Aunt Edith takes digitalin for her heart.",
    "She\nhas a whole bottle full of little tablets up in her room.",
    "Now the bottles\nempty.",
    "She ought to keep things like that locked up.",
    "She did.",
    "I suppose it wouldnt be difficult for someone to find out\nwhere she hid the key.",
    "Someone Who I looked again at the pile of luggage.",
    "I said suddenly\nand loudly\n\nThey cant go away.",
    "They mustnt be allowed to.",
    "Sophia looked surprised.",
    "Roger and Clemency Charles you dont think \n\n\fWell what do you think\n\nSophia stretched out her hands in a helpless gesture.",
    "I dont know Charles she whispered.",
    "I only know that Im back back in the nightmare \n\nI know.",
    "Those were the very words I used to myself as I drove down\nwith Taverner.",
    "Because this is just what a nightmare is.",
    "Walking about among people\nyou know looking in their faces  and suddenly the faces change  and\nits not someone you know any longer  its a stranger  a cruel\nstranger...\n\nShe cried\n\nCome outside Charles  come outside.",
    "Its safer outside... Im afraid\nto stay in this house...\n\nChapter 25\n\nWe stayed in the garden a long time.",
    "By a kind of tacit consent we did\nnot discuss the horror that was weighing upon us.",
    "Instead Sophia talked affectionately of the dead woman of things they\nhad done and games they had played as children with Nannie  and\n\n\ftales that the old woman used to tell them about Roger and their father\nand the other brothers and sisters.",
    "They were her real children you see.",
    "She only came back to us to\nhelp during the war when Josephine was a baby and Eustace was a\nfunny little boy.",
    "There was a certain balm for Sophia in these memories and I\nencouraged her to talk.",
    "I wondered what Taverner was doing.",
    "Questioning the household I\nsuppose.",
    "A car drove away with the police photographer and two\nother men and presently an ambulance drove up.",
    "Sophia shivered a little.",
    "Presently the ambulance left and we knew that\nNannies body had been taken away in preparation for an autopsy.",
    "And still we sat or walked in the garden and talked  our words\nbecoming more and more of a cloak for our real thoughts.",
    "Finally with a shiver Sophia said\n\nIt must be very late  its almost dark.",
    "Weve got to go in.",
    "Aunt Edith\nand Josephine havent come back...",
    "Surely they ought to be back by\nnow\n\nA vague uneasiness woke in me.",
    "What had happened Was Edith\ndeliberately keeping the child away from the Crooked House\n\nWe went in.",
    "Sophia drew all the curtains.",
    "The fire was lit and the big drawing room looked harmonious with an\nunreal air of bygone luxury.",
    "Great bowls of bronze chrysanthemums\nstood on the tables.",
    "Sophia rang and a maid who I recognised as having been formerly\nupstairs brought in tea.",
    "She had red eyes and sniffed continuously.",
    "Also I noticed that she had a frightened way of glancing quickly over\nher shoulder.",
    "Magda joined us but Philips tea was sent in to him in the library.",
    "Magdas r\u00f4le was a stiff frozen image of grief.",
    "She spoke little or not at\nall.",
    "She said once\n\nWhere are Edith and Josephine Theyre out very late.",
    "But she said it in a preoccupied kind of way.",
    "But I myself was becoming increasingly uneasy.",
    "I asked if Taverner\nwere still in the house and Magda replied that she thought so.",
    "I went in\nsearch of him.",
    "I told him that I was worried about Miss de Haviland and\nthe child.",
    "He went immediately to the telephone and gave certain instructions.",
    "Ill let you know when I have news he said.",
    "I thanked him and went back to the drawing room.",
    "Sophia was there\nwith Eustace.",
    "Magda had gone.",
    "Hell let us know if he hears anything I said to Sophia.",
    "She said in a low voice\n\nSomethings happened Charles something must have happened.",
    "My dear Sophia its not really late yet.",
    "What are you bothering about said Eustace.",
    "Theyve probably\ngone to the cinema.",
    "He lounged out of the room.",
    "I said to Sophia She may have taken\nJosephine to a hotel  or up to London.",
    "I think she fully realised that the\nchild was in danger  perhaps she realised it better than we did.",
    "Sophia replied with a sombre look that I could not quite fathom.",
    "She kissed me goodbye...",
    "I did not see quite what she meant by that disconnected remark or\nwhat it was supposed to show.",
    "I asked if Magda was worried.",
    "Mother No shes all right.",
    "Shes no sense of time.",
    "Shes reading a\nnew play of Vavasour Jones called The Woman Disposes.",
    "Its a funny\nplay about murder  a female Bluebeard  cribbed from Arsenic and\nOld Lace if you ask me but its got a good womans part a woman\nwhos got a mania for being a widow.",
    "I said no more.",
    "We sat pretending to read.",
    "It was half past six when Taverner opened the door and came in.",
    "His\nface prepared us for what he had to say.",
    "Sophia got up.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "Ive got bad news for you.",
    "I sent out a general alarm for the\ncar.",
    "A motorist reported having seen a Ford car with a number\nsomething like that turning off the main road at Flackspur Heath through the woods.",
    "Not  the track to the Flackspur Quarry\n\nYes Miss Leonides.",
    "He paused and went on The cars been found\nin the quarry.",
    "Both the occupants were dead.",
    "Youll be glad to know\nthey were killed outright.",
    "Josephine It was Magda standing in the doorway.",
    "Her voice rose in\na wail.",
    "Josephine... My baby.",
    "Sophia went to her and put her arms round her.",
    "I said Wait a minute.",
    "I had remembered something Edith de Haviland writing a couple of\nletters at the desk going out into the hall with them in her hand.",
    "But they had not been in her hand when she got into the car.",
    "I dashed out into the hall and went to the long oak chest.",
    "I found the\nletters  pushed inconspicuously to the back behind a brass tea urn.",
    "The uppermost was addressed to Chief Inspector Taverner.",
    "Taverner had followed me.",
    "I handed the letter to him and he tore it\nopen.",
    "Standing beside him I read its brief contents.",
    "My expectation is that this will be opened after my death.",
    "I wish to\nenter into no details but I accept full responsibility for the deaths of\nmy brotherinlaw Aristide Leonides and Janet Rowe Nannie.",
    "I hereby\nsolemnly declare that Brenda Leonides and Laurence Brown are\ninnocent of the murder of Aristide Leonides.",
    "Enquiry of Dr Michael\nChavasse 783 Harley Street will confirm that my life could only have\nbeen prolonged for a few months.",
    "I prefer to take this way out and to\nspare two innocent people the ordeal of being charged with a murder\nthey did not commit.",
    "I am of sound mind and fully conscious of what I\nwrite.",
    "Edith Elfrida de Haviland.",
    "As I finished the letter I was aware that Sophia too had read it whether with Taverners concurrence or not I dont know.",
    "Aunt Edith.",
    "murmured Sophia.",
    "I remembered Edith de Havilands ruthless foot grinding bindweed into\nthe earth.",
    "I remembered my early almost fanciful suspicions of her.",
    "But why Sophia spoke the thought in my mind before I came to it.",
    "But why Josephine Why did she take Josephine with her\n\nWhy did she do it at all I demanded.",
    "What was her motive\n\nBut even as I said that I knew the truth.",
    "I saw the whole thing clearly.",
    "I\nrealised that I was still holding her second letter in my hand.",
    "I looked\ndown and saw my own name on it.",
    "It was thicker and harder than the other one.",
    "I think I knew what was in\nit before I opened it.",
    "I tore the envelope along and Josephines little\nblack notebook fell out.",
    "I picked it up off the floor  it came open in my\nhand and I saw the entry on the first page...",
    "Sounding from a long way away I heard Sophias voice clear and self\ncontrolled.",
    "Weve got it all wrong she said.",
    "Edith didnt do it.",
    "No I said.",
    "Sophia came closer to me  she whispered\n\nIt was  Josephine  wasnt it That was it Josephine.",
    "Together we looked down on the first entry in the little black book\nwritten in an unformed childish hand.",
    "Today I killed grandfather...\n\nChapter 26\n\nI was to wonder afterwards that I could have been so blind.",
    "The truth\nhad stuck out so clearly all along.",
    "Josephine and only Josephine fitted\nin with all the necessary qualifications.",
    "Her vanity her persistent selfimportance her delight in talking her reiteration on how clever she\nwas and how stupid the police were.",
    "I had never considered her because she was a child.",
    "But children have\ncommitted murders and this particular murder had been well within a\nchilds compass.",
    "Her grandfather himself had indicated the precise\nmethod  he had practically handed her a blue print.",
    "All she had to do\nwas to avoid leaving fingerprints and the slightest knowledge of\ndetective fiction would teach her that.",
    "And everything else had been a\nmere hotch potch culled at random from stock mystery stories.",
    "The\nnotebook  the sleuthing  her pretended suspicions her insistence\nthat she was not going to tell till she was sure...\n\nAnd finally the attack on herself.",
    "An almost incredible performance\nconsidering that she might easily have killed herself.",
    "But then childlike she never considered such a possibility.",
    "She was\nthe heroine.",
    "The heroine isnt killed.",
    "Yet there had been a clue there the traces of earth on the seat of the old chair in the wash house.",
    "Josephine was the only person who would have had to climb up on a\nchair to balance the block of marble on the top of the door.",
    "Obviously it\nhad missed her more than once the dints in the floor and patiently\nshe had climbed up again and replaced it handling it with her scarf to\navoid fingerprints.",
    "And then it had fallen  and she had had a near\nescape from death.",
    "It had been the perfect set up  the impression she was aiming for She\nwas in danger she knew something she had been attacked\n\nI saw how that had deliberately drawn my attention to her presence in\nthe cylinder room.",
    "And she had completed the artistic disorder of her\nroom before going out to the wash house.",
    "But when she had returned from hospital when she had found Brenda\nand Laurence arrested she must have become dissatisfied.",
    "The case was over  and she  Josephine was out of the lime light.",
    "So she stole the digitalin from Ediths room and put it in her own cup of\ncocoa and left the cup untouched on the hall table.",
    "Did she know that Nannie would drink it Possibly.",
    "From her words\nthat morning she had resented Nannies criticisms of her.",
    "Did Nannie perhaps wise from a lifetime of experience with children\nsuspect I think that Nannie knew had always known that Josephine\n\n\fwas not normal.",
    "With her precocious mental development had gone a\nretarded moral sense.",
    "Perhaps too the various factors of heredity what Sophia had called the ruthlessness of the family had met\ntogether.",
    "She had had an authoritarian ruthlessness of her grandmothers\nfamily and the ruthless egoism of Magda seeing only her own point of\nview.",
    "She had also presumably suffered sensitive like Philip from the\nstigma of being the unattractive  the changeling child  of the family.",
    "Finally in her very marrow had run the essential crooked strain of old\nLeonides.",
    "She had been Leonidess grandchild she had resembled\nhim in brain and in cunning  but his love had gone outwards to family\nand friends hers had turned to herself.",
    "I thought that old Leonides had realised what none of the rest of the\nfamily had realised that Josephine might be a source of danger to\nothers and to herself.",
    "He had kept her from school life because he was\nafraid of what she might do.",
    "He had shielded her and guarded her in\nthe home and I understood now his urgency to Sophia to look after\nJosephine.",
    "Magdas sudden decision to send Josephine abroad had that too\nbeen due to a fear for the child Not perhaps a conscious fear but\nsome vague maternal instinct.",
    "And Edith de Haviland Had she first\nsuspected then feared  and finally known\n\nI looked down at the letter in my hand.",
    "Dear Charles.",
    "This is in confidence for you  and for Sophia if you so\ndecide.",
    "It is imperative that someone should know the truth.",
    "I found\nthe enclosed in the disused dog kennel outside the back door.",
    "She\nkept it there.",
    "It confirms what I already suspected.",
    "The action I am\nabout to take may be right or wrong  I do not know.",
    "But my life in any\ncase is close to its end and I do not want the child to suffer as I\nbelieve she would suffer if called to earthly account for what she has\ndone.",
    "There is often one of the litter who is not quite right.",
    "If I do wrong.",
    "God forgive me  but I do it out of love.",
    "God bless you\nboth.",
    "Edith de Haviland\n\nI hesitated for only a moment then I handed the letter to Sophia.",
    "Together we again opened Josephines little black book.",
    "Today I killed grandfather.",
    "We turned the pages.",
    "It was an amazing production.",
    "Interesting I\nshould imagine to a psychologist.",
    "It set out with such terrible clarity\nthe fury of thwarted egoism.",
    "The motive for the crime was set down pitifully childish and\ninadequate.",
    "Grandfather wouldnt let me do bally dancing so I made up my mind I\nwould kill him.",
    "Then we would go to London and live and mother\nwouldnt mind me doing bally.",
    "I give only a few entries.",
    "They are all significant.",
    "I dont want to go to Switzerland  I wont go.",
    "If mother makes me I will\nkill her too  only I cant get any poison.",
    "Perhaps I could make it with\nyouberries.",
    "They are poisonous the book says so.",
    "Eustace has made\nme very cross to day.",
    "He says I am only a girl and no use and that its\nsilly my detecting.",
    "He wouldnt think me silly if he knew it was me did\nthe murder.",
    "I like Charles  but he is rather stupid.",
    "I have not decided yet who I\nshall make have done the crime.",
    "Perhaps Brenda and Laurence Brenda is nasty to me  she says I am not all there but I like Laurence he told me about Chariot Korday  she killed someone in his bath.",
    "She\nwas not very clever about it.",
    "The last entry was revealing.",
    "I hate Nannie...",
    "I hate her...",
    "I hate her... She says I am only a little girl.",
    "She says I show off.",
    "Shes making mother send me abroad... Im going\nto kill her too  I think Aunt Ediths medicine would do it.",
    "If there is\nanother murder then the police will come back and it will all be\nexciting again.",
    "Nannies dead.",
    "I am glad.",
    "I havent decided yet where Ill hide the bottle\nwith the little pill things.",
    "Perhaps in Aunt Clemencys room  or else\nEustace.",
    "When I am dead as an old woman I shall leave this behind me\naddressed to the Chief of the Police and they will see what a really\ngreat criminal I was.",
    "I closed the book.",
    "Sophias tears were flowing fast.",
    "Oh Charles  oh Charles  its so dreadful.",
    "Shes such a little monster and yet  and yet its so terribly pathetic.",
    "I had felt the same.",
    "I had liked Josephine...",
    "I still felt a fondness for her... You do not like\nanyone less because they have tuberculosis or some other fatal\ndisease.",
    "Josephine was as Sophia had said a little monster but she\nwas a pathetic little monster.",
    "She had been born with a kink  the\ncrooked child of the little crooked house.",
    "Sophia asked\n\nIf  she had lived  what would have happened\n\nI suppose she would have been sent to a reformatory or a special\nschool.",
    "Later she would have been released  or possibly certified I\ndont know.",
    "Sophia shuddered.",
    "Its better the way it is.",
    "But Aunt Edith  I dont like to think of her\ntaking the blame.",
    "She chose to do so.",
    "I dont suppose it will be made public.",
    "I imagine\nthat when Brenda and Laurence come to trial no case will be brought\nagainst them and they will be discharged.",
    "And you Sophia I said this time on a different note and taking both\nher hands in mine will marry me.",
    "Ive just heard Im appointed to\nPersia.",
    "We will go out there together and you will forget the little\nCrooked House.",
    "Your mother can put on plays and your father can buy\nmore books and Eustace will soon go to a university.",
    "Dont worry about\nthem any more.",
    "Think of me.",
    "Sophia looked at me straight in the eyes.",
    "Arent you afraid Charles to marry me\n\nWhy should I be In poor little Josephine all the worst of the family\ncame together.",
    "In you Sophia I fully believe that all that is bravest and\n\n\fbest in the Leonides family has been handed down to you.",
    "Your\ngrandfather thought highly of you and he seems to have been a man\nwho was usually right.",
    "Hold up your head my darling.",
    "The future is\nours.",
    "I will Charles.",
