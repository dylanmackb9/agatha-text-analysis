    "\n\nTo Dr and Mrs Campbell Thompson\n\n\n\n\f\nChapter 1\nA Theatrical Party\nThe memory of the public is short.",
    "Already the intense interest and excitement aroused by the murder of\nGeorge Alfred St Vincent Marsh fourth Baron Edgware is a thing past and forgotten.",
    "Newer sensations\nhave taken its place.",
    "My friend Hercule Poirot was never openly mentioned in connection with the case.",
    "This I may say\nwas entirely in accordance with his own wishes.",
    "He did not choose to appear in it.",
    "The credit went\nelsewhere\u2014and that is how he wished it to be.",
    "Moreover from Poirot\u2019s own peculiar private point of\nview the case was one of his failures.",
    "He always swears that it was the chance remark of a stranger in\nthe street that put him on the right track.",
    "However that may be it was his genius that discovered the truth of the affair.",
    "But for Hercule Poirot I\ndoubt if the crime would have been brought home to its perpetrator.",
    "I feel therefore that the time has come for me to set down all I know of the affair in black and white.",
    "I\nknow the ins and outs of the case thoroughly and I may also mention that I shall be fulfilling the wishes of\na very fascinating lady in so doing.",
    "I have often recalled that day in Poirot\u2019s prim neat little sittingroom when striding up and down a\nparticular strip of carpet my little friend gave us his masterly and astounding r\u00e9sum\u00e9of the case.",
    "I am\ngoing to begin my narrative where he did on that occasion\u2014at a London theatre in June of last year.",
    "Carlotta Adams was quite the rage in London at that moment.",
    "The year before she had given a couple of\nmatinees which had been a wild success.",
    "This year she had had a three weeks\u2019 season of which this was\nthe last night but one.",
    "Carlotta Adams was an American girl with the most amazing talent for singlehanded sketches\nunhampered by makeup or scenery.",
    "She seemed to speak every language with ease.",
    "Her sketch of an\nevening in a foreign hotel was really wonderful.",
    "In turn American tourists German tourists middleclass\nEnglish families questionable ladies impoverished Russian aristocrats and weary discreet waiters all\nflitted across the scene.",
    "Her sketches went from grave to gay and back again.",
    "Her dying CzechoSlovakian woman in hospital\nbrought a lump to the throat.",
    "A minute later we were rocking with laughter as a dentist plied his trade and\nchatted amiably with his victims.",
    "Her programme closed with what she announced as \u2018Some Imitations\u2019.",
    "Here again she was amazingly clever.",
    "Without makeup of any kind her features seemed to dissolve\nsuddenly and reform themselves into those of a famous politician or a wellknown actress or a society\nbeauty.",
    "In each character she gave a short typical speech.",
    "These speeches by the way were remarkably\nclever.",
    "They seemed to hit off every weakness of the subject selected.",
    "One of her last impersonations was Jane Wilkinson\u2014a talented young American actress well known in\nLondon.",
    "It was really very clever.",
    "Inanities slipped off her tongue charged with some powerful emotional\nappeal so that in spite of yourself you felt that each word was uttered with some potent and fundamental\nmeaning.",
    "Her voice exquisitely toned with a deep husky note in it was intoxicating.",
    "The restrained\ngestures each strangely significant the slightly swaying body the impression even of strong physical\nbeauty\u2014how she did it I cannot think\nI had always been an admirer of the beautiful Jane Wilkinson.",
    "She had thrilled me in her emotional parts\nand I had always maintained in face of those who admitted her beauty but declared she was no actress\nthat she had considerable histrionic powers.",
    "It was a little uncanny to hear that wellknown slightly husky voice with the fatalistic drop in it that had\nstirred me so often and to watch that seemingly poignant gesture of the slowly closing and unclosing\nhand and the sudden throw back of the head with the hair shaken back from the face that I realized she\nalways gave at the close of a dramatic scene.",
    "Jane Wilkinson was one of those actresses who had left the stage on her marriage only to return to it a\ncouple of years later.",
    "Three years ago she had married the wealthy but slightly eccentric Lord Edgware.",
    "Rumour went that she\nleft him shortly afterwards.",
    "At any rate eighteen months after the marriage she was acting for the films in\nAmerica and had this season appeared in a successful play in London.",
    "Watching Carlotta Adams\u2019 clever but perhaps slightly malicious imitation it occurred to me to wonder\nhow much imitations were regarded by the subject selected.",
    "Were they pleased at the notoriety\u2014at the\nadvertisement it afforded Or were they annoyed at what was after all a deliberate exposing of the\ntricks of their trade Was not Carlotta Adams in the position of the rival conjurer who says \u2018Oh this is\nan old trick Very simple.",
    "I\u2019ll show you how this one\u2019s done\u2019\nI decided that ifI were the subject in question I should be very much annoyed.",
    "I should of course\nconceal my vexation but decidedly I should not like it.",
    "One would need great broadmindedness and a\ndistinct sense of humour to appreciate such a merciless expos\u00e9.",
    "I had just arrived at these conclusions when the delightful husky laugh from the stage was echoed from\nbehind me.",
    "I turned my head sharply.",
    "In the seat immediately behind mine leaning forward with her lips slightly\nparted was the subject of the present imitation\u2014Lady Edgware better known as Jane Wilkinson.",
    "I realized immediately that my deductions had been all wrong.",
    "She was leaning forward her lips parted\nwith an expression of delight and excitement in her eyes.",
    "As the \u2018imitation\u2019 finished she applauded loudly laughing and turning to her companion a tall extremely\n\n\fgoodlooking man of the Greek god type whose face I recognized as one better known on the screen\nthan on the stage.",
    "It was Bryan Martin the hero of the screen most popular at the moment.",
    "He and Jane\nWilkinson had been starred together in several screen productions.",
    "\u2018Marvellous isn\u2019t she\u2019 Lady Edgware was saying.",
    "He laughed.",
    "\u2018Jane\u2014you look all excited.\u2019\n\u2018Well she really is too wonderful Heaps better than I thought she\u2019d be.\u2019\nI did not catch Bryan Martin\u2019s amused rejoinder.",
    "Carlotta Adams had started on a fresh improvisation.",
    "What happened later is I shall always think a very curious coincidence.",
    "After the theatre Poirot and I went on to supper at the Savoy.",
    "At the very next table to ours were Lady Edgware Bryan Martin and two other people whom I did not\nknow.",
    "I pointed them out to Poirot and as I was doing so another couple came and took their places at\nthe table beyond that again.",
    "The woman\u2019s face was familiar and yet strangely enough for the moment I\ncould not place it.",
    "Then suddenly I realized that it was Carlotta Adams at whom I was staring The man I did not know.",
    "He\nwas wellgroomed with a cheerful somewhat vacuous face.",
    "Not a type that I admire.",
    "Carlotta Adams was dressed very inconspicuously in black.",
    "Hers was not a face to command instant\nattention or recognition.",
    "It was one of those mobile sensitive faces that preeminently lend themselves to\nthe art of mimicry.",
    "It could take on an alien character easily but it had no very recognizable character of\nits own.",
    "I imparted these reflections of mine to Poirot.",
    "He listened attentively his eggshaped head cocked\nslightly to one side whilst he darted a sharp glance at the two tables in question.",
    "\u2018So that is Lady Edgware Yes I remember\u2014I have seen her act.",
    "She isbelle femme .\u2019\n\u2018And a fine actress too.\u2019\n\u2018Possibly.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t seem convinced.\u2019\n\u2018I think it would depend on the setting my friend.",
    "If she is the centre of the play if all revolves round\nher\u2014yes then she could play her part.",
    "I doubt if she could play a small part adequately or even what is\ncalled a character part.",
    "The play must be writtenabout her andfor her.",
    "She appears to me of the type of\nwomen who are interested only in themselves.\u2019 He paused and then added rather unexpectedly \u2018Such\npeople go through life in great danger.\u2019\n\u2018Danger\u2019 I said surprised.",
    "\u2018I have used a word that surprises you I seemon ami .",
    "Yes danger.",
    "Because you see a woman like\n\n\fthat sees only one thing\u2014herself.",
    "Such women see nothing of the dangers and hazards that surround\nthem\u2014the million conflicting interests and relationships of life.",
    "No they see only their own forward path.",
    "And so\u2014sooner or later\u2014disaster.\u2019\nI was interested.",
    "I confessed to myself that such a point of view would not have struck me.",
    "\u2018And the other\u2019 I asked.",
    "\u2018Miss Adams\u2019\nHis gaze swept to her table.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 he said smiling.",
    "\u2018What do you want me to say about her\u2019\n\u2018Only how she strikes you.\u2019\n\u2018Mon cher am I tonight the fortuneteller who reads the palm and tells the character\u2019\n\u2018You could do it better than most\u2019 I rejoined.",
    "\u2018It is a very pretty faith that you have in me Hastings.",
    "It touches me.",
    "Do you not know my friend that\neach one of us is a dark mystery a maze of conflicting passions and desires and attitudesMais oui c\u2019est\nvrai .",
    "One makes one\u2019s little judgments\u2014but nine times out of ten one is wrong.\u2019\n\u2018Not Hercule Poirot\u2019 I said smiling.",
    "\u2018Even Hercule Poirot Oh I know very well that you have always a little idea that I am conceited but\nindeed I assure you I am really a very humble person.\u2019\nI laughed.",
    "\u2018You\u2014humble\u2019\n\u2018It is so.",
    "Except\u2014I confess it\u2014that I am a little proud of my moustaches.",
    "Nowhere in London have I\nobserved anything to compare with them.\u2019\n\u2018You are quite safe\u2019 I said dryly.",
    "\u2018You won\u2019t.",
    "So you are not going to risk judgment on Carlotta\nAdams\u2019\n\u2018Elle est artiste\u2019 said Poirot simply.",
    "\u2018That covers nearly all does it not\u2019\n\u2018Anyway you don\u2019t consider that she walks through life in peril\u2019\n\u2018We all do that my friend\u2019 said Poirot gravely.",
    "\u2018Misfortune may always be waiting to rush out upon us.",
    "But as to your question Miss Adams I think will succeed.",
    "She is shrewd and she is something more.",
    "You observed without doubt that she is a Jewess\u2019\nI had not.",
    "But now that he mentioned it I saw the faint traces of Semitic ancestry.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "\u2018It makes for success\u2014that.",
    "Though there is still one avenue of danger\u2014since it is of danger we are\ntalking.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018You mean\u2019\n\u2018Love of money.",
    "Love of money might lead such a one from the prudent and cautious path.\u2019\n\u2018It might do that to all of us\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018That is true but at any rate you or I would see the danger involved.",
    "We could weigh the pros and cons.",
    "If you care for money too much it is only the money you see everything else is in shadow.\u2019\nI laughed at his serious manner.",
    "\u2018Esmeralda the gipsy queen is in good form\u2019 I remarked teasingly.",
    "\u2018The psychology of character is interesting\u2019 returned Poirot unmoved.",
    "\u2018One cannot be interested in\ncrime without being interested in psychology.",
    "It is not the mere act of killing it is what liesbehind it that\nappeals to the expert.",
    "You follow me Hastings\u2019\nI said that I followed him perfectly.",
    "\u2018I have noticed that when we work on a case together you are always urging me on to physical action\nHastings.",
    "You wish me to measure footprints to analyse cigaretteash to prostrate myself on my\nstomach for the examination of detail.",
    "You never realize that by lying back in an armchair with the eyes\nclosed one can come nearer to the solution of any problem.",
    "One sees then with the eyes of the mind.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018When I lie back in an armchair with my eyes closed one thing happens to me and one\nthing only\u2019\n\u2018I have noticed it\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018It is strange.",
    "At such moments the brain should be working feverishly\nnot sinking into sluggish repose.",
    "The mental activity it is so interesting so stimulating The employment of\nthe little grey cells is a mental pleasure.",
    "They and they only can be trusted to lead one through fog to the\ntruth\u2026\u2019\nI am afraid that I have got into the habit of averting my attention whenever Poirot mentions his little grey\ncells.",
    "I have heard it all so often before.",
    "In this instance my attention wandered to the four people sitting at the next table.",
    "When Poirot\u2019s\nmonologue drew to a close I remarked with a chuckle\n\u2018You have made a hit Poirot.",
    "The fair Lady Edgware can hardly take her eyes off you.\u2019\n\u2018Doubtless she has been informed of my identity\u2019 said Poirot trying to look modest and failing.",
    "\u2018I think it is the famous moustaches\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018She is carried away by their beauty.\u2019\nPoirot caressed them surreptitiously.",
    "\u2018It is true that they are unique\u2019 he admitted.",
    "\u2018Oh my friend the \u201ctoothbrush\u201d as you call it that you\nwear\u2014it is a horror\u2014an atrocity\u2014a wilful stunting of the bounties of nature.",
    "Abandon it my friend I\npray of you.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018By Jove\u2019 I said disregarding Poirot\u2019s appeal.",
    "\u2018The lady\u2019s getting up.",
    "I believe she\u2019s coming to speak\nto us.",
    "Bryan Martin is protesting but she won\u2019t listen to him.\u2019\nSure enough Jane Wilkinson swept impetuously from her seat and came over to our table.",
    "Poirot rose\nto his feet bowing and I rose also.",
    "\u2018M.",
    "Hercule Poirot isn\u2019t it\u2019 said the soft husky voice.",
    "\u2018At your service.\u2019\n\u2018M.",
    "Poirot I want to talk to you.",
    "I must talk to you.\u2019\n\u2018But certainly Madame will you not sit down\u2019\n\u2018No no not here.",
    "I want to talk to you privately.",
    "We\u2019ll go right upstairs to my suite.\u2019\nBryan Martin had joined her he spoke now with a deprecating laugh.",
    "\u2018You must wait a little Jane.",
    "We\u2019re in the middle of supper.",
    "So is M. Poirot.\u2019\nBut Jane Wilkinson was not so easily turned from her purpose.",
    "\u2018Why Bryan what does that matter We\u2019ll have supper sent up to the suite.",
    "Speak to them about it will\nyou And Bryan\u2014\u2019\nShe went after him as he was turning away and appeared to urge some course upon him.",
    "He stood out\nabout it I gathered shaking his head and frowning.",
    "But she spoke even more emphatically and finally\nwith a shrug of the shoulders he gave way.",
    "Once or twice during her speech to him she had glanced at the table where Carlotta Adams sat and I\nwondered if what she were suggesting had anything to do with the American girl.",
    "Her point gained Jane came back radiant.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ll go right up now\u2019 she said and included me in a dazzling smile.",
    "The question of our agreeing or not agreeing to her plan didn\u2019t seem to occur to her mind.",
    "She swept us\noff without a shade of apology.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s the greatest luck just seeing you here this evening M. Poirot\u2019 she said as she led the way to the lift.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s wonderful how everything seems to turn out right for me.",
    "I\u2019d just been thinking and wondering what\non earth I was going to do and I looked up and there you were at the next table and I said to myself\n\u201cM.",
    "Poirot will tell me what to do.\u201d\u2019\nShe broke off to say \u2018Second Floor\u2019 to the liftboy.",
    "\u2018If I can be of aid to you\u2014\u2019 began Poirot.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sure you can.",
    "I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re just the most marvellous man that ever existed.",
    "Somebody\u2019s got to\nget me out of the tangle I\u2019m in and I feel you\u2019re just the man to do it.\u2019\n\n\fWe got out at the second floor and she led the way along the corridor paused at a door and entered\none of the most opulent of the Savoy suites.",
    "Casting her white fur wrap on one chair and her small jewelled bag on the table the actress sank on to\na chair and exclaimed\n\u2018M.",
    "Poirot somehow or other I\u2019ve justgot to get rid of my husband\u2019\nChapter 2\nA Supper Party\nAfter a moment\u2019s astonishment Poirot recovered himself\n\u2018But Madame\u2019 he said his eyes twinkling \u2018getting rid of husbands is not my speciality.\u2019\n\u2018Well of course I know that.\u2019\n\u2018It is a lawyer you require.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s just where you\u2019re wrong.",
    "I\u2019m just about sick and tired of lawyers.",
    "I\u2019ve had straight lawyers and\ncrooked lawyers and not one of them\u2019s done me any good.",
    "Lawyers just know the law they don\u2019t seem\nto have any kind of natural sense.\u2019\n\u2018And you think I have\u2019\nShe laughed.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re the cat\u2019s whiskers M. Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018Comment The cat\u2019s whiskers I do not understand.\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2014that you\u2019reit .\u2019\n\u2018Madame I may or may not have brains\u2014as a matter of fact I have\u2014why pretend But your little affair\nit is not mygenre .\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t see why not.",
    "It\u2019s a problem.\u2019\n\u2018Oh a problem\u2019\n\u2018And it\u2019s difficult\u2019 went on Jane Wilkinson.",
    "\u2018I should say you weren\u2019t the man to shy at difficulties.\u2019\n\u2018Let me compliment you on your insight Madame.",
    "But all the same me I do not make the investigations\nfor divorce.",
    "It is not pretty\u2014ce m\u00e9tier l\u00e0.\u2019\n\u2018My dear man.",
    "I\u2019m not asking you to do spying work.",
    "It wouldn\u2019t be any good.",
    "But I\u2019ve just got to get\nrid of the man and I\u2019m sure you could tell me how to do it.\u2019\nPoirot paused awhile before replying.",
    "When he did there was a new note in his voice.",
    "\u2018First tell me Madame why are you so anxious to \u201cget rid\u201d of Lord Edgware\u2019\nThere was no delay or hesitation about her answer.",
    "It came swift and pat.",
    "\u2018Why of course.",
    "I want to get married again.",
    "What other reason could there be\u2019\nHer great blue eyes opened ingenuously.",
    "\u2018But surely a divorce should be easy to obtain\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t know my husband M. Poirot.",
    "He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s\u2014\u2019 She shivered.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know how to explain it.",
    "He\u2019s a queer man\u2014he\u2019s not like other people.\u2019\nShe paused and then went on.",
    "\u2018He should never have married\u2014anyone.",
    "I know what I\u2019m talking about.",
    "I just can\u2019t describe him but\nhe\u2019s\u2014queer.",
    "His first wife you know ran away from him.",
    "Left a baby of three months behind.",
    "He never\ndivorced her and she died miserably abroad somewhere.",
    "Then he married me.",
    "Well\u2014I couldn\u2019t stick it.",
    "I\nwas frightened.",
    "I left him and went to the States.",
    "I\u2019ve no grounds for a divorce and if I\u2019ve given him\ngrounds for one he won\u2019t take notice of them.",
    "He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s a kind of fanatic.\u2019\n\u2018In certain American states you could obtain a divorce Madame.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s no good to me\u2014not if I\u2019m going to live in England.\u2019\n\u2018You want to live in England\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Who is the man you want to marry\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s just it.",
    "The Duke of Merton.\u2019\nI drew in my breath sharply.",
    "The Duke of Merton had so far been the despair of matchmaking mammas.",
    "A young man of monkish tendencies a violent AngloCatholic he was reported to be completely under\nthe thumb of his mother the redoubtable dowager duchess.",
    "His life was austere in the extreme.",
    "He\ncollected Chinese porcelain and was reputed to be of aesthetic tastes.",
    "He was supposed to care nothing\nfor women.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m just crazy about him\u2019 said Jane sentimentally.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s unlike anyone I ever met and Merton Castle is\ntoo wonderful.",
    "The whole thing is the most romantic business that ever happened.",
    "He\u2019s so goodlooking\ntoo\u2014like a dreamy kind of monk.\u2019\nShe paused.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m going to give up the stage when I marry.",
    "I just don\u2019t seem to care about it any more.\u2019\n\u2018In the meantime\u2019 said Poirot dryly \u2018Lord Edgware stands in the way of these romantic dreams.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2014and it\u2019s driving me to distraction.\u2019 She leaned back thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018Of course if we were only in\nChicago I could get him bumped off quite easily but you don\u2019t seem to run to gunmen over here.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Over here\u2019 said Poirot smiling \u2018we consider that every human has the right to live.\u2019\n\u2018Well I don\u2019t know about that.",
    "I guess you\u2019d be better off without some of your politicians and\nknowing what I do of Edgware I think he\u2019d be no loss\u2014rather the contrary.\u2019\nThere was a knock at the door and a waiter entered with supper dishes.",
    "Jane Wilkinson continued to\ndiscuss her problem with no appreciation of his presence.",
    "\u2018But I don\u2019t want you to kill him for me M. Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018Merci Madame.\u2019\n\u2018I thought perhaps you might argue with him in some clever way.",
    "Get him to give in to the idea of\ndivorce.",
    "I\u2019m sure you could.\u2019\n\u2018I think you overrate my persuasive powers Madame.\u2019\n\u2018Oh but you can surely think ofsomething  M. Poirot.\u2019 She leaned forward.",
    "Her blue eyes opened wide\nagain.",
    "\u2018You\u2019d like me to be happy wouldn\u2019t you\u2019\nHer voice was soft low and deliciously seductive.",
    "\u2018I should like everybody to be happy\u2019 said Poirot cautiously.",
    "\u2018Yes but I wasn\u2019t thinking of everybody.",
    "I was thinking of just me.\u2019\n\u2018I should say you always do that Madame.\u2019\nHe smiled.",
    "\u2018You think I\u2019m selfish\u2019\n\u2018Oh I did not say so Madame.\u2019\n\u2018I dare say I am.",
    "But you see I do so hate being unhappy.",

    "\u2018Youwill help me won\u2019t you M. Poirot\u2019 She rose picking up the white wrap and stood looking\nappealingly into his face.",
    "I heard the noise of voices outside in the corridor.",
    "The door was ajar.",

    "\u2018If I don\u2019t Madame\u2019\nShe laughed.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll have to call a taxi to go round and bump him off myself.\u2019\nLaughing she disappeared through a door to an adjoining room just as Bryan Martin came in with the\nAmerican girl Carlotta Adams and her escort and the two people who had been supping with him and\nJane Wilkinson.",
    "They were introduced to me as Mr and Mrs Widburn.",
    "\u2018Hello\u2019 said Bryan.",
    "\u2018Where\u2019s Jane I want to tell her I\u2019ve succeeded in the commission she gave me.\u2019\nJane appeared in the doorway of the bedroom.",
    "She held a lipstick in one hand.",
    "\u2018Have you got her How marvellous.",
    "Miss Adams I do admire your performance so.",
    "I felt I just had to\nknow you.",
    "Come in here and talk to me while I fix my face.",
    "It\u2019s looking too perfectly frightful.\u2019\nCarlotta Adams accepted the invitation.",
    "Bryan Martin flung himself down in a chair.",
    "\u2018Well M. Poirot\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018You were duly captured.",
    "Has our Jane persuaded you to fight her battles\nYou might as well give in sooner as later.",
    "She doesn\u2019t understand the word \u201cNo.\u201d\u2019\n\u2018She has not come across it perhaps.\u2019\n\u2018A very interesting character Jane\u2019 said Bryan Martin.",
    "He lay back in his hair and puffed cigarette\nsmoke idly towards the ceiling.",
    "\u2018Taboos have no meaning for her.",
    "No morals whatever.",
    "I don\u2019t mean\nshe\u2019s exactly immoral\u2014she isn\u2019t.",
    "Amoral is the word I believe.",
    "Just sees one thing only in life\u2014what\nJane wants.\u2019\nHe laughed.",
    "\u2018I believe she\u2019d kill somebody quite cheerfully\u2014and feel injured if they caught her and wanted to hang\nher for it.",
    "The trouble is that shewould be caught.",
    "She hasn\u2019t any brains.",
    "Her idea of a murder would be\nto drive up in a taxi sail in under her own name and shoot.\u2019\n\u2018Now I wonder what makes you say that\u2019 murmured Poirot.",
    "\u2018Eh\u2019\n\u2018You know her well Monsieur\u2019\n\u2018I should say I did.\u2019\nHe laughed again and it struck me that his laugh was unusually bitter.",
    "\u2018You agree don\u2019t you\u2019 he flung out to the others.",
    "\u2018Oh Jane\u2019s an egoist\u2019 agreed Mrs Widburn.",
    "\u2018An actress has got to be though.",
    "That is if she wants to\nexpress her personality.\u2019\nPoirot did not speak.",
    "His eyes were resting on Bryan Martin\u2019s face dwelling there with a curious\nspeculative expression that I could not quite understand.",
    "At that moment Jane sailed in from the next room Carlotta Adams behind her.",
    "I presume that Jane had\nnow \u2018fixed her face\u2019 whatever that term denoted to her own satisfaction.",
    "It looked to me exactly the\n\n\fsame as before and quite incapable of improvement.",
    "The supper party that followed was quite a merry one yet I sometimes had the feeling that there were\nundercurrents which I was incapable of appreciating.",
    "Jane Wilkinson I acquitted of any subtleties.",
    "She was obviously a young woman who saw only one thing\nat a time.",
    "She had desired an interview with Poirot and had carried her point and obtained her desire\nwithout delay.",
    "Now she was obviously in high good humour.",
    "Her desire to include Carlotta Adams in the\nparty had been I decided a mere whim.",
    "She had been highly amused as a child might be amused by\nthe clever counterfeit of herself.",
    "No the undercurrents that I sensed were nothing to do with Jane Wilkinson.",
    "In what direction did they\nlie\nI studied the guests in turn.",
    "Bryan Martin He was certainly not behaving quite naturally.",
    "But that I told\nmyself might be merely characteristic of a film star.",
    "The exaggerated selfconsciousness of a vain man\ntoo accustomed to playing a part to lay it aside easily.",
    "Carlotta Adams at any rate was behaving naturally enough.",
    "She was a quiet girl with a pleasant low\nvoice.",
    "I studied her with some attention now that I had a chance to do so at close quarters.",
    "She had I\nthought distinct charm but charm of a somewhat negative order.",
    "It consisted in an absence of any jarring\nor strident note.",
    "She was a kind of personified soft agreement.",
    "Her very appearance was negative.",
    "Soft\ndark hair eyes a rather colourless pale blue pale face and a mobile sensitive mouth.",
    "A face that you\nliked but that you would find it hard to know again if you were to meet her say in different clothes.",
    "She seemed pleased at Jane\u2019s graciousness and complimentary sayings.",
    "Any girl would be I\nthought\u2014and then\u2014just at that moment\u2014something occurred that caused me to revise that rather hasty\nopinion.",
    "Carlotta Adams looked across the table at her hostess who was at that moment turning her head to talk\nto Poirot.",
    "There was a curious scrutinizing quality in the girl\u2019s gaze\u2014it seemed a deliberate summing up\nand at the same time it struck me that there was a very definite hostility in those pale blue eyes.",
    "Fancy perhaps.",
    "Or possibly professional jealousy.",
    "Jane was a successful actress who had definitely\narrived.",
    "Carlotta was merely climbing the ladder.",
    "I looked at the three other members of the party.",
    "Mr and Mrs Widburn what about them He was a tall\ncadaverous man she a plump fair gushing soul.",
    "They appeared to be wealthy people with a passion for\neverything connected with the stage.",
    "They were in fact unwilling to talk on any other subject.",
    "Owing to\nmy recent absence from England they found me sadly illinformed and finally Mrs Widburn turned a\nplump shoulder on me and remembered my existence no more.",
    "The last member of the party was the dark young man with the round cheerful face who was Carlotta\nAdams\u2019 escort.",
    "I had had my suspicions from the first that the young man was not quite so sober as he\nmight have been.",
    "As he drank more champagne this became even more clearly apparent.",
    "He appeared to be suffering from a profound sense of injury.",
    "For the first half of the meal he sat in\ngloomy silence.",
    "Towards the latter half he unbosomed himself to me apparently under the impression that\nI was one of his oldest friends.",
    "\u2018What I mean to say\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018It isn\u2019t.",
    "No dear old chap it isn\u2019t\u2014\u2019\n\n\fI omit the slight slurring together of the words.",

    "Very obliging\nchap my tailor.",
    "I\u2019ve owed him money for years.",
    "Makes a sort of bond between us.",
    "Nothing like a bond\nis there dear old fellow.",
    "You and I.",
    "You and I.",
    "Who the devil are you by the way\u2019\n\u2018My name is Hastings.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t say so.",

    "Dear old Spencer\nJones.",
    "Met him at the Eton and Harrow and borrowed a fiver from him.",
    "What I say is one face is very\nlike another face\u2014that\u2019s what I say.",
    "If we were a lot of Chinks we wouldn\u2019t know each other apart.\u2019\nHe shook his head sadly then cheered up suddenly and drank off some more champagne.",
    "\u2018Anyway\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m not a damned nigger.\u2019\nThis reflection seemed to cause him such elation that he presently made several remarks of a hopeful\ncharacter.",
    "\u2018Look on the bright side my boy\u2019 he adjured me.",
    "\u2018What I say is look on the bright side.",
    "One of these\ndays\u2014when I\u2019m seventyfive or so I\u2019m going to be a rich man.",
    "When my uncle dies.",
    "Then I can pay my\ntailor.\u2019\nHe sat smiling happily at the thought.",
    "There was something strangely likeable about the young man.",
    "He had a round face and an absurdly small\nblack moustache that gave one the impression of being marooned in the middle of a desert.",
    "Carlotta Adams I noticed had an eye on him and it was after a glance in his direction that she rose and\nbroke up the party.",
    "\u2018It was just sweet of you to come up here\u2019 said Jane.",
    "\u2018I do so love doing things on the spur of the\nmoment don\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 said Miss Adams.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m afraid I always plan a thing out very carefully before I do it.",
    "It\nsaves\u2014worry.\u2019\nThere was something faintly disagreeable in her manner.",
    "\u2018Well at any rate the results justify you\u2019 laughed Jane.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know when I enjoyed anything so much\nas I did your show tonight.\u2019\nThe American girl\u2019s face relaxed.",
    "\u2018Well that\u2019s very sweet of you\u2019 she said warmly.",
    "\u2018And I guess I appreciate your telling me so.",
    "I need\nencouragement.",
    "We all do.\u2019\n\u2018Carlotta\u2019 said the young man with the black moustache.",
    "\u2018Shake hands and say thank you for the party\nto Aunt Jane and come along.\u2019\nThe way he walked straight through the door was a miracle of concentration.",
    "Carlotta followed him\nquickly.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 said Jane \u2018what was that that blew in and called me Aunt Jane I hadn\u2019t noticed him before.\u2019\n\u2018My dear\u2019 said Mrs Widburn.",
    "\u2018You mustn\u2019t take any notice of him.",
    "Most brilliant as a boy in the\nO.U.D.S.",
    "You\u2019d hardly think so now would you I hate to see early promise come to nothing.",
    "But\nCharles and I positively must toddle.\u2019\nThe Widburns duly toddled and Bryan Martin went with them.",
    "\u2018Well M. Poirot\u2019\nHe smiled at her.",
    "\u2018Eh bien Lady Edgware\u2019\n\u2018For goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t call me that.",
    "Let me forget it If you aren\u2019t the hardesthearted little man in\nEurope\u2019\n\u2018But no but no I am not hardhearted.\u2019\nPoirot I thought had had quite enough champagne possibly a glass too much.",
    "\u2018Then you\u2019ll go and see my husband And make him do what I want\u2019\n\u2018I will go and see him\u2019 Poirot promised cautiously.",
    "\u2018And if he turns you down\u2014as he will\u2014you\u2019ll think of a clever plan.",
    "They say you\u2019re the cleverest man\nin England M. Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018Madame when I am hardhearted it is Europe you mention.",
    "But for cleverness you say only England.\u2019\n\u2018If you put this through I\u2019ll say the universe.\u2019\nPoirot raised a deprecating hand.",
    "\u2018Madame I promise nothing.",
    "In the interests of the psychology I will endeavour to arrange a meeting\nwith your husband.\u2019\n\u2018Psychoanalyse him as much as you like.",
    "Maybe it would do him good.",
    "But you\u2019ve got to pull it\noff\u2014for my sake.",
    "I\u2019ve got to have my romance M. Poirot.\u2019\nShe added dreamily \u2018Just think of the sensation it will make.\u2019\n\n\fChapter 3\nThe Man with the Gold Tooth\nIt was a few days later when we were sitting at breakfast that Poirot flung across to me a letter that he\nhad just opened.",
    "\u2018Wellmon ami \u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018What do you think of that\u2019\nThe note was from Lord Edgware and in stiff formal language it made an appointment for the following\nday at eleven.",
    "I must say that I was very much surprised.",
    "I had taken Poirot\u2019s words uttered lightly in a convivial\nmoment and I had had no idea that he had actually taken steps to carry out his promise.",
    "Poirot who was very quickwitted read my mind and his eyes twinkled a little.",
    "\u2018But yesmon ami  it was not solely the champagne.\u2019\n\u2018I didn\u2019t mean that.\u2019\n\u2018But yes\u2014but yes\u2014you thought to yourself the poor old one he has the spirit of the party he promises\nthings that he will not perform\u2014that he has no intention of performing.",
    "But my friend the promises of\nHercule Poirot are sacred.\u2019\nHe drew himself up in a stately manner as he said the last words.",
    "\u2018Of course.",
    "Of course.",
    "I know that\u2019 I\nsaid hastily.",
    "\u2018But I thought that perhaps your judgment was slightly\u2014what shall I say\u2014influenced.\u2019\n\u2018I am not in the habit of letting my judgment be \u201cinfluenced\u201d as you call it Hastings.",
    "The best and driest\nof champagne the most goldenhaired and seductive of women\u2014nothing influences the judgment of\nHercule Poirot.",
    "Nomon ami  I am interested\u2014that is all.\u2019\n\u2018In Jane Wilkinson\u2019s love affair\u2019\n\u2018Not exactly that.",
    "Her love affair as you call it is a very commonplace business.",
    "It is a step in the\nsuccessful career of a very beautiful woman.",
    "If the Duke of Merton had neither a title nor wealth his\nromantic likeness to a dreamy monk would no longer interest the lady.",
    "No Hastings what intrigues me is\nthe psychology of the matter.",
    "The interplay of character.",
    "I welcome the chance of studying Lord\nEdgware at close quarters.\u2019\n\u2018You do not expect to be successful in your mission\u2019\n\u2018Pourquoi pasEvery man has his weak spot.",
    "Do not imagine Hastings that because I am studying the\ncase from a psychological standpoint I shall not try my best to succeed in the commission entrusted to\nme.",
    "I always enjoy exercising my ingenuity.\u2019\nI had feared an allusion to the little grey cells and was thankful to be spared it.",
    "\u2018So we go to Regent Gate at eleven tomorrow\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018We\u2019 Poirot raised his eyebrows quizzically.",

    "\u2018You are not going to leave me behind.",
    "I always go with you.\u2019\n\u2018If it were a crime a mysterious poisoning case an assassination\u2014ah these are the things your soul\ndelights in.",
    "But a mere matter of social adjustment\u2019\n\u2018Not another word\u2019 I said determinedly.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m coming.\u2019\nPoirot laughed gently and at that moment we were told that a gentleman had called.",
    "To our great surprise our visitor proved to be Bryan Martin.",
    "The actor looked older by daylight.",
    "He was still handsome but it was a kind of ravaged handsomeness.",
    "It flashed across my mind that he might conceivably take drugs.",
    "There was a kind of nervous tension\nabout him that suggested the possibility.",
    "\u2018Good morning M. Poirot\u2019 he said in a cheerful manner.",
    "\u2018You and Captain Hastings breakfast at a\nreasonable hour I am glad to see.",
    "By the way I suppose you are very busy just now\u2019\nPoirot smiled at him amiably.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018At the moment I have practically no business of importance on hand.\u2019\n\u2018Come now\u2019 laughed Bryan.",
    "\u2018Not called in by Scotland Yard No delicate matters to investigate for\nRoyalty I can hardly believe it.\u2019\n\u2018You confound fiction with reality my friend\u2019 said Poirot smiling.",
    "\u2018I am I assure you at the moment\ncompletely out of work though not yet on the dole.Dieu merci .\u2019\n\u2018Well that\u2019s luck for me\u2019 said Bryan with another laugh.",
    "\u2018Perhaps you\u2019ll take on something for me.\u2019\nPoirot considered the young man thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018You have a problem for me\u2014yes\u2019 he said in a minute or two.",
    "\u2018Well\u2014it\u2019s like this.",
    "I have and I haven\u2019t.\u2019\nThis time his laugh was rather nervous.",
    "Still considering him thoughtfully Poirot indicated a chair.",
    "The\nyoung man took it.",
    "He sat facing us for I had taken a seat by Poirot\u2019s side.",
    "\u2018And now\u2019 said Poirot \u2018let us hear all about it.\u2019\nBryan Martin still seemed to have a little difficulty in getting under way.",
    "\u2018The trouble is that I can\u2019t tell you quite as much as I\u2019d like to.\u2019 He hesitated.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s difficult.",
    "You see the\nwhole business started in America.\u2019\n\u2018In America Yes\u2019\n\u2018A mere incident first drew my attention to it.",
    "As a matter of fact I was travelling by train and I noticed a\n\n\fcertain fellow.",
    "Ugly little chap cleanshaven glasses and a gold tooth.\u2019\n\u2018Ah a gold tooth.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly.",
    "That\u2019s really the crux of the matter.\u2019\nPoirot nodded his head several times.",
    "\u2018I begin to comprehend.",
    "Go on.\u2019\n\u2018Well as I say.",
    "I just noticed the fellow.",
    "I was travelling by the way to New York.",
    "Six months later I\nwas in Los Angeles and I noticed the fellow again.",
    "Don\u2019t know why I should have\u2014but I did.",
    "Still\nnothing in that.\u2019\n\u2018Continue.\u2019\n\u2018A month afterwards I had occasion to go to Seattle and shortly after I got there who should I see but\nmy friend againonly this time he wore a beard .\u2019\n\u2018Distinctly curious.\u2019\n\u2018Wasn\u2019t it Of course I didn\u2019t fancy it had anything to do with me at that time but when I saw the man\nagain in Los Angeles beardless in Chicago with a moustache and different eyebrows and in a mountain\nvillage disguised as a hobo\u2014well I began to wonder.\u2019\n\u2018Naturally.\u2019\n\u2018And at last\u2014well it seemed odd\u2014but not a doubt about it.",
    "I was being what you call shadowed.\u2019\n\u2018Most remarkable.\u2019\n\u2018Wasn\u2019t it After that I made sure of it.",
    "Wherever I was there somewhere near at hand was my\nshadow made up in different disguises.",
    "Fortunately owing to the gold tooth I could always spot him.\u2019\n\u2018Ah that gold tooth it was a very fortunate occurrence.\u2019\n\u2018It was.\u2019\n\u2018Pardon me M. Martin but did you never speak to the man Question him as to the reason of his\npersistent shadowing\u2019\n\u2018No I didn\u2019t.\u2019 The actor hesitated.",
    "\u2018I thought of doing so once or twice but I always decided against it.",
    "It seemed to me that I should merely put the fellow on his guard and learn nothing.",
    "Possibly once they\nhad discovered that I had spotted him they would have put someone else on my track\u2014someone whom\nI might not recognize.\u2019\n\u2018En effet\u2026someone without that useful gold tooth.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly.",
    "I may have been wrong\u2014but that\u2019s how I figured it out.\u2019\n\u2018Now M. Martin you referred to \u201cthey\u201d just now.",
    "Whom did you mean by \u201cthey\u201d\u2019\n\n\f\u2018It was a mere figure of speech used for convenience.",
    "I assumed\u2014I don\u2019t know why\u2014a nebulous\n\u201cthey\u201d in the background.\u2019\n\u2018Have you any reason for that belief\u2019\n\u2018None.\u2019\n\u2018You mean you have no conception of who could want you shadowed or for what purpose\u2019\n\u2018Not the slightest idea.",
    "At least\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Continuez\u2019 said Poirot encouragingly.",
    "\u2018Ihave an idea\u2019 said Bryan Martin slowly.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s a mere guess on my part mind.\u2019\n\u2018A guess may be very successful sometimes Monsieur.\u2019\n\u2018It concerns a certain incident that took place in London about two years ago.",
    "It was a slight incident\nbut an inexplicable and an unforgettable one.",
    "I\u2019ve often wondered and puzzled over it.",
    "Just because I\ncould find no explanation of it at the time I am inclined to wonder if this shadowing business might not be\nconnected in some way with it\u2014but for the life of me I can\u2019t see why or how.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps I can.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but you see\u2014\u2019 Bryan Martin\u2019s embarrassment returned.",
    "\u2018The awkward thing is that I can\u2019t tell\nyou about it\u2014not now that is.",
    "In a day or so I might be able to.\u2019\nStung into further speech by Poirot\u2019s inquiring glance he continued desperately.",
    "\u2018You see\u2014a girl was concerned in it.\u2019\n\u2018Ah parfaitementAn English girl\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "At least\u2014why\u2019\n\u2018Very simple.",
    "You cannot tell me now but you hope to do so in a day or two.",
    "That means that you want\nto obtain the consent of the young lady.",
    "Therefore she is in England.",
    "Also she must have been in England\nduring the time you were shadowed for if she had been in America you would have sought her out then\nand there.",
    "Therefore since she has been in England for the last eighteen months she is probably though\nnot certainly English.",
    "It is good reasoning that eh\u2019\n\u2018Rather.",
    "Now tell me M. Poirot if I get her permission will you look into the matter for me\u2019\nThere was a pause.",
    "Poirot seemed to be debating the matter in his mind.",

    "What I mean is ifyou investigate the affair nothing need be made public need it\u2019\n\n\f\u2018That depends\u2019 said Poirot calmly.",

    "There may be.\u2019\n\u2018But you would do your best for her\u2014for us\u2019\n\u2018That naturally.\u2019\nHe was silent for a moment and then said\n\u2018Tell me this follower of yours\u2014this shadow\u2014of what age was he\u2019\n\u2018Oh quite youngish.",
    "About thirty.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018That is indeed remarkable.",
    "Yes that makes the whole thing very much more\ninteresting.\u2019\nI stared at him.",
    "So did Bryan Martin.",
    "This remark of his was I am sure equally unexplicable to us both.",
    "Bryan questioned me with a lift of the eyebrows.",

    "\u2018I will undertake it.",
    "I find it\u2014interesting.\u2019\nThere was something queer in the way he said the last word.",
    "I went downstairs with Bryan Martin.",
    "At\nthe door he said to me\n\u2018Did you get the hang of what he meant about that fellow\u2019s age I mean why was it interesting that he\nshould be about thirty I didn\u2019t get the hang of that at all.\u2019\n\u2018No more did I\u2019 I admitted.",

    "No hole and corner business.",
    "All the papers will be full of it.",

    "Among those present were Sir George and Lady du Fisse Mr James Blunt the wellknown dramatic\ncritic Sir Oscar Hammerfeldt of the Overton Film Studios Miss Jane Wilkinson Lady Edgware and\nothers.",

    "You of all people ought to know better than that.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Oh I do I do.",
    "It only struck me as curious that was all.\u2019\n\u2018These coincidences do happen.",
    "Now M. Poirot close as an oyster I know you to be by bitter\nexperience.",
    "But you\u2019ll come across with things won\u2019t you You\u2019ll tell me why Lord Edgware sent for\nyou\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u2018Lord Edgware did not send for me.",
    "It was I who requested him to give me an appointment.\u2019\n\u2018Really And for what reason\u2019\nPoirot hesitated a minute.",
    "\u2018I will answer your question\u2019 he said slowly.",
    "\u2018But I should like to answer it in my own way.\u2019\nJapp groaned.",

    "First you sound as though you thought the woman might not have\ndone it after all.",
    "And now you make out that you knew it all along.\u2019\nPoirot only smiled.",
    "Chapter 6\nThe Widow\nBryan Martin was as good as his word.",
    "In less than ten minutes he had joined us.",
    "During the time that\nwe waited his arrival Poirot would only talk of extraneous subjects and refused to satisfy Japp\u2019s curiosity\nin the smallest degree.",

    "The actor started.",
    "\u2018Do you mean to say\u2014\u2019 His eyes seemed starting out of his head.",

    "\u2018It is not as though you were accusing her.",
    "She is already accused.",
    "You cannot refuse to tell us what you know.",

    "\u2018You are wrong my dear young man\u2019 he said gently.",
    "\u2018I saw Lord Edgware yesterdayand he agreed to\na divorce .\u2019\nThere was no doubt that Bryan Martin was completely dumbfounded by this piece of news.",
    "He stared at\nPoirot with his eyes almost starting out of his head.",
    "\u2018You\u2014you saw him yesterday\u2019 he spluttered.",
    "\u2018At a quarterpast twelve\u2019 said Poirot in his methodical manner.",
    "\u2018And he agreed to a divorce\u2019\n\n\f\u2018He agreed to a divorce.\u2019\n\u2018You should have told Jane at once\u2019 cried the young man reproachfully.",

    "Poirot smiled.",
    "\u2018It impairs the motive a little does it not\u2019 he murmured.",
    "\u2018And now M. Martin let me call your attention\nto this.\u2019\nHe showed him the newspaper paragraph.",
    "Bryan read it but without much interest.",
    "\u2018You mean this makes an alibi\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I suppose Edgware was shot some time yesterday evening\u2019\n\u2018He was stabbed not shot\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "Martin laid the paper down slowly.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m afraid this does no good\u2019 he said regretfully.",
    "\u2018Jane didn\u2019t go to that dinner.\u2019\n\u2018How do you know\u2019\n\u2018I forget.",
    "Somebody told me.\u2019\n\u2018That is a pity\u2019 said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Japp looked at him curiously.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t make you out Moosior.",
    "Seems now as though you don\u2019t want the young woman to be guilty.\u2019\n\u2018No no my good Japp.",
    "I am not the partisan you think.",
    "But frankly the case as you present it revolts\nthe intelligence.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean revolts the intelligence It doesn\u2019t revolt mine.\u2019\nI could see words trembling on Poirot\u2019s lips.",
    "He restrained them.",
    "\u2018Here is a young woman who wishes you say to get rid of her husband.",
    "That point I do not dispute.",
    "She told me so frankly.Eh bien  how does she set about it She repeats several times in the loud clear\nvoice before witnesses that she is thinking of killing him.",

    "Calls at his\nhouse has herself announced stabs him and goes away.",
    "What do you call that my good friend Has it\neven the common sense\u2019\n\u2018It was a bit foolish of course.\u2019\n\u2018Foolish It is the imbecility\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Well\u2019 said Japp rising.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s all to the advantage of the police when criminals lose their heads.",
    "I must go\nback to the Savoy now.\u2019\n\u2018You permit that I accompany you\u2019\nJapp made no demur and we set out.",
    "Bryan Martin took a reluctant leave of us.",
    "He seemed to be in a\ngreat state of nervous excitement.",

    "In my own car.",
    "I hire it from the Daimler people.\u2019\n\u2018And whilst you were at the dinner you didn\u2019t leave it\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2014I\u2014\u2019\n\u2018So you did leave it\u2019\nIt was like a terrier pouncing on a rat.",

    "\u2018Of course not.\u2019\n\u2018How long were you away from the dinner table\u2019\n\u2018About a minute and a half.\u2019\nJapp collapsed after that.",
    "I was fully convinced that he did not believe a word she was saying but having\nheard her story he could do no more until he had confirmed or disproved it.",
    "Having thanked her coldly he withdrew.",
    "We also took our leave but she called Poirot back.",

    "He ought to know about this.",
    "I don\u2019t like\nto send it myself.",
    "I guess I\u2019ve got to look the bereaved widow for a week or two.\u2019\n\u2018It is quite unnecessary to cable Madame\u2019 said Poirot gently.",
    "\u2018It will be in the papers over there.\u2019\n\u2018Why what a headpiece you\u2019ve got Of course it will.",
    "Much better not to cable.",

    "I want to act the way a widow should.",

    "I suppose I shall have to go to the funeral.",
    "What do you think\u2019\n\u2018You will have to go to the inquest first Madame.\u2019\n\u2018Why I suppose that\u2019s true.\u2019 She considered for a moment or two.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t like that Scotland Yard\ninspector at all.",
    "He just scared me to death.",
    "M. Poirot\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018Seems it\u2019s kind of lucky I changed my mind and went to that party after all.\u2019\nPoirot had been going towards the door.",
    "Suddenly at these words he wheeled round.",
    "\u2018What is that you say Madame You changed your mind\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "I meant to give it a miss.",
    "I had a frightful headache yesterday afternoon.\u2019\n\n\fPoirot swallowed once or twice.",
    "He seemed to have a difficulty in speaking.",
    "\u2018Did you\u2014say so to anyone\u2019 he asked at last.",
    "\u2018Certainly I did.",
    "There was quite a crowd of us having tea and they wanted me to go on to a cocktail\nparty and I said \u201cNo.\u201d I said my head was aching fit to split and that I was going right home and that I\nwas going to cut the dinner too.\u2019\n\u2018And what made you change your mind Madame\u2019\n\u2018Ellis went on at me.",
    "Said I couldn\u2019t afford to turn it down.",
    "Old Sir Montagu pulls a lot of strings you\nknow and he\u2019s a crotchety creature\u2014takes offence easily.",
    "Well I didn\u2019t care.",
    "Once I marry Merton I\u2019m\nthrough with all this.",
    "But Ellis is always on the cautious side.",
    "She said there\u2019s many a slip etc.",
    "and after\nall I guess she\u2019s right.",
    "Anyway off I went.\u2019\n\u2018You owe Ellis a debt of gratitude Madame\u2019 said Poirot seriously.",
    "\u2018I suppose I do.",
    "That inspector had got it all taped out hadn\u2019t he\u2019\nShe laughed Poirot did not.",
    "He said in a low voice\n\u2018All the same\u2014this gives one furiously to think.",
    "Yes furiously to think.\u2019\n\u2018Ellis\u2019 called Jane.",
    "The maid came in from the next room.",
    "\u2018M.",
    "Poirot says it\u2019s very lucky you made me go to that party last night.\u2019\nEllis barely cast a glance at Poirot.",
    "She was looking grim and disapproving.",
    "\u2018It doesn\u2019t do to break engagements m\u2019lady.",
    "You\u2019re much too fond of doing it.",
    "People don\u2019t always\nforgive it.",
    "They turn nasty.\u2019\nJane picked up the hat she had been trying on when we came in.",
    "She tried it again.",
    "\u2018I hate black\u2019 she said disconsolately.",
    "\u2018I never wear it.",
    "But I suppose as a correct widow I\u2019ve just got\nto.",
    "All those hats are too frightful.",
    "Ring up the other hat place Ellis.",
    "I\u2019ve got to be fit to be seen.\u2019\nPoirot and I slipped quietly from the room.",
    "Chapter 7\nThe Secretary\nWe had not seen the last of Japp.",
    "He reappeared about an hour later flung down his hat on the table\nand said he was eternally blasted.",
    "\u2018You have made the inquiries\u2019 asked Poirot sympathetically.",
    "Japp nodded gloomily.",
    "\u2018And unless fourteen people are lying she didn\u2019t do it\u2019 he growled.",
    "He went on\n\u2018I don\u2019t mind telling you M. Poirot that I expected to find a putup job.",
    "On the face of it it didn\u2019t seem\nlikely that anyone else could have killed Lord Edgware.",
    "She\u2019s the only person who\u2019s got the ghost of a\nmotive.\u2019\n\u2018I would not say that.Mais continuez .\u2019\n\u2018Well as I say I expected to find a putup job.",
    "You know what these theatrical crowds are\u2014they\u2019d all\nhang together to screen a pal.",
    "But this is rather a different proposition.",
    "The people there last night were all\nbig guns they were none of them close friends of hers and some of them didn\u2019t know each other.",
    "Their\ntestimony is independent and reliable.",
    "I hoped then to find that she\u2019d slipped away for half an hour or so.",
    "She could easily have done that\u2014powdering her nose or some such excuse.",
    "But no she did leave the\ndinner table as she told us to answer a telephone call but the butler was with her\u2014and by the way it\nwas just as she told us.",
    "He heard what she said.",
    "\u201cYes quite right.",
    "This is Lady Edgware.\u201d And then the\nother side rang off.",
    "It\u2019s curious that you know.",
    "Not that it\u2019s got anything to do with it.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps not\u2014but it is interesting.",
    "Was it a man or a woman who rang up\u2019\n\u2018A woman I think she said.\u2019\n\u2018Curious\u2019 said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018Never mind that\u2019 said Japp impatiently.",
    "\u2018Let\u2019s get back to the important part.",
    "The whole evening went\nexactly as she said.",
    "She got there at a quarter to nine left at halfpast eleven and got back here at a\nquarter to twelve.",
    "I\u2019ve seen the chauffeur who drove her\u2014he\u2019s one of Daimler\u2019s regular people.",
    "And the\npeople at the Savoy saw her come in and confirm the time.\u2019\n\u2018Eh bien that seems very conclusive.\u2019\n\u2018Then what about those two in Regent Gate It isn\u2019t only the butler.",
    "Lord Edgware\u2019s secretary saw her\ntoo.",
    "They both swear by all that\u2019s holy that it was Lady Edgware who came here at ten o\u2019clock.\u2019\n\u2018How long has the butler been there\u2019\n\u2018Six months.",
    "Handsome chap by the way.\u2019\n\u2018Yes indeed.Eh bien  my friend if he has only been there six months he cannot have recognized Lady\nEdgware since he had not seen her before.\u2019\n\u2018Well he knew her from her pictures in the papers.",
    "And anyway the secretary knew her.",
    "She\u2019s been\nwith Lord Edgware five or six years and she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s absolutely positive.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018I should like to see the secretary.\u2019\n\u2018Well why not come along with me now\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Thank youmon ami  I should be delighted to do so.",
    "You include Hastings in your invitation I hope\u2019\nJapp grinned.",
    "\u2018What do you think Where the master goes there the dog follows\u2019 he added in what I could not think\nwas the best of taste.",
    "\u2018Reminds me of the Elizabeth Canning Case\u2019 said Japp.",
    "\u2018You remember How at least a score of\nwitnesses on either side swore they had seen the gipsy Mary Squires in two different parts of England.",
    "Good reputable witnesses too.",
    "And she with such a hideous face there couldn\u2019t be two like it.",
    "That\nmystery was never cleared up.",
    "It\u2019s very much the same here.",
    "Here\u2019s a separate lot of people prepared to\nswear a woman was in two different places at the same time.",
    "Which of \u2019em is speaking the truth\u2019\n\u2018That ought not to be difficult to find out.\u2019\n\u2018So you say\u2014but this woman\u2014Miss Carroll reallyknew Lady Edgware.",
    "I mean she\u2019d lived in the\nhouse with her day after day.",
    "She wouldn\u2019t be likely to make a mistake.\u2019\n\u2018We shall soon see.\u2019\n\u2018Who comes into the title\u2019 I asked.",
    "\u2018A nephew Captain Ronald Marsh.",
    "Bit of a waster I understand.\u2019\n\u2018What does the doctor say as to the time of death\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ll have to wait for the autopsy to be exact you know.",
    "See where the dinner had got to.\u2019 Japp\u2019s\nway of putting things was I am sorry to say far from refined.",
    "\u2018But ten o\u2019clock fits in well enough.",
    "He\nwas last seen alive at a few minutes past nine when he left the dinner table and the butler took whisky and\nsoda into the library.",
    "At eleven o\u2019clock when the butler went up to bed the light was out\u2014so he must\nhave been dead then.",
    "He wouldn\u2019t have been sitting in the dark.\u2019\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "A moment or two later we drew up at the house the blinds of which were\nnow down.",
    "The door was opened to us by the handsome butler.",
    "Japp took the lead and went in first.",
    "Poirot and I followed.",
    "The door opened to the left so that the\nbutler stood against the wall on that side.",
    "Poirot was on my right and being smaller than I was it was\nonly just as we stepped into the hall that the butler saw him.",
    "Being close to him I heard the sudden intake\nof his breath and looked sharply at the man to find him staring at Poirot with a kind of startled fear visible\non his face.",
    "I put the fact away in my mind for what it might be worth.",
    "Japp marched into the diningroom which lay on our right and called the butler in after him.",
    "\u2018Now then Alton I want to go into this again very carefully.",
    "It was ten o\u2019clock when this lady came\u2019\n\u2018Her ladyship Yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018How did you recognize her\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "\u2018She told me her name sir and besides I\u2019ve seen her portrait in the papers.",
    "I\u2019ve seen her act too.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018How was she dressed\u2019\n\u2018In black sir.",
    "Black walking dress and a small black hat.",
    "A string of pearls and grey gloves.\u2019\nPoirot looked a question at Japp.",
    "\u2018White taffeta evening dress and ermine wrap\u2019 said the latter succinctly.",
    "The butler proceeded.",
    "His tale tallied exactly with that which Japp had already passed on to us.",
    "\u2018Did anybody else come and see your master that evening\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "\u2018No sir.\u2019\n\u2018How was the front door fastened\u2019\n\u2018It has a Yale lock sir.",
    "I usually draw the bolts when I go to bed sir.",
    "At eleven that is.",
    "But last night\nMiss Geraldine was at the opera so it was left unbolted.\u2019\n\u2018How was it fastened this morning\u2019\n\u2018It was bolted sir.",
    "Miss Geraldine had bolted it when she came in.\u2019\n\u2018When did she come in Do you know\u2019\n\u2018I think it was about a quarter to twelve sir.\u2019\n\u2018Then during the evening until a quarter to twelve the door could not be opened from outside without a\nkey From the inside it could be opened by simply drawing back the handle.\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018How many latchkeys were there\u2019\n\u2018His lordship had his sir and there was another key in the hall drawer which Miss Geraldine took last\nnight.",
    "I don\u2019t know if there were any others.\u2019\n\u2018Does nobody else in the house have a key\u2019\n\u2018No sir.",
    "Miss Carroll always rings.\u2019\nPoirot intimated that that was all he wished to ask and we went in search of the secretary.",
    "We found her busily writing at a large desk.",
    "Miss Carroll was a pleasant efficientlooking woman of about fortyfive.",
    "Her fair hair was turning grey\nand she wore pincenez through which a pair of shrewd blue eyes gleamed out on us.",
    "When she spoke I\n\n\frecognized the clear businesslike voice that had spoken to me through the telephone.",
    "\u2018Ah M. Poirot\u2019 she said as she acknowledged Japp\u2019s introduction.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "It was with you I made that\nappointment for yesterday morning.\u2019\n\u2018Precisely Mademoiselle.\u2019\nI thought that Poirot was favourably impressed by her.",
    "Certainly she was neatness and precision\npersonified.",
    "\u2018Well Inspector Japp\u2019 said Miss Carroll.",
    "\u2018What more can I do for you\u2019\n\u2018Just this.",
    "Are you absolutely certain that it was Lady Edgware who came here last night\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the third time you\u2019ve asked me.",
    "Of course I\u2019m sure.",
    "I saw her.\u2019\n\u2018Where did you see her Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018In the hall.",
    "She spoke to the butler for a minute then she went along the hall and in at the library door.\u2019\n\u2018And where were you\u2019\n\u2018On the first floor\u2014looking down.\u2019\n\u2018And you were positive you were not mistaken\u2019\n\u2018Absolutely.",

    "\u2018I am not one to gossip M. Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018But you can tell us the truth concerning the rumours of a serious disagreement between Lord Edgware\nand his nephew.\u2019\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t so serious as all that.",

    "\u2018It was up there that you stood was it not last night Mademoiselle\u2019 said Poirot suddenly pointing with\nhis hands up the stairs.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "Why\u2019\n\u2018And you saw Lady Edgware go along the hall into the study\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018And you saw her face distinctly\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.\u2019\n\u2018But you could not have seen her face Mademoiselle.",
    "You can only have seen the back of her head\nfrom where you were standing.\u2019\nMiss Carroll flushed angrily.",
    "She seemed taken aback.",
    "\u2018Back of her head her voice her walk It\u2019s all the same thing.",
    "Absolutely unmistakable I tell you Iknow\nit was Jane Wilkinson\u2014a thoroughly bad woman if there ever was one.\u2019\nAnd turning away she flounced upstairs.",
    "Chapter 8\nPossibilities\nJapp had to leave us.",
    "Poirot and I turned into Regent\u2019s Park and found a quiet seat.",
    "\u2018I see the point of your rose between the lips now\u2019 I said laughing.",

    "You\n\n\fnotice that she stated positively that she saw the visitor\u2019sface  At the time I thought that impossible.",
    "Comingfrom the study\u2014yes but not goingto the study.",
    "So I made my little experiment which resulted asI\nthought and then sprung my trap upon her.",
    "She immediately changed her ground.\u2019\n\u2018Her belief was quite unaltered though\u2019 I argued.",
    "\u2018And after all a voice and a walk are just as\nunmistakable.\u2019\n\u2018No no.\u2019\n\u2018Why Poirot I think a voice and the general gait are about the most characteristic things about a\nperson.\u2019\n\u2018I agree.",
    "And therefore they are the most easily counterfeited.\u2019\n\u2018You think\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Cast your mind back a few days.",
    "Do you remember one evening as we sat in the stalls of a theatre\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Carlotta Adams Ah but then she is a genius.\u2019\n\u2018A wellknown person is not so difficult to mimic.",
    "But I agree she has unusual gifts.",
    "I believe she could\ncarry a thing through without the aid of footlights and distance\u2014\u2019\nA sudden thought flashed into my mind.",
    "\u2018Poirot\u2019 I cried.",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t think that possibly\u2014no that would be too much of a coincidence.\u2019\n\u2018It depends how you look at it Hastings.",
    "Regarded from one angle it would be no coincidence at all.\u2019\n\u2018But why should Carlotta Adams wish to kill Lord Edgware She did not even know him.\u2019\n\u2018How do you know she did not know him Do not assume things Hastings.",
    "There may have been some\nlink between them of which we know nothing.",
    "Not that that is precisely my theory.\u2019\n\u2018Then you have a theory\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "The possibility of Carlotta Adams being involved struck me from the beginning.\u2019\n\u2018But Poirot\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Wait Hastings.",
    "Let me put together a few facts for you.",
    "Lady Edgware with a complete lack of\nreticence discusses the relations between her and her husband and even goes so far as to talk of killing\nhim.",
    "Not only you and I hear this.",
    "A waiter hears it her maid probably has heard it many times Bryan\nMartin hears it and I imagine Carlotta Adams herself hears it.",
    "And there are the people to whom these\npeople repeat it.",
    "Then in that same evening the excellence of Carlotta Adams\u2019 imitation of Jane is\ncommented upon.",
    "Who had a motive for killing Lord Edgware His wife.",
    "\u2018Now supposing that someone else wishes to do away with Lord Edgware.",
    "Here is a scapegoat ready\nto his hand.",
    "On the day when Jane Wilkinson announced that she had a headache and is going to have a\nquiet evening\u2014the plan is put into operation.",
    "\u2018Lady Edgware must be seen to enter the house in Regent Gate.",
    "Well she is seen.",
    "She even goes so far\nas to announce her identity.Ah c\u2019est peu trop \u00e7a It would awaken suspicion in an oyster.",
    "\u2018And another point\u2014a small point I admit.",
    "The woman who came to the house last night wore black.",
    "Jane Wilkinson never wears black .",
    "We heard her say so.",
    "Let us assume then that the woman who\ncame to the house last night wasnot Jane Wilkinson\u2014that it was a woman impersonating Jane Wilkinson.",
    "Did that woman kill Lord Edgware\n\u2018Did a third person enter that house and kill Lord Edgware If so did the person enter before or after\nthe supposed visit of Lady Edgware If after what did the woman say to Lord Edgware How did she\nexplain her presence She might deceive the butler who did not know her and the secretary who did not\nsee her at close quarters.",
    "But she could not hope to deceive her husband.",
    "Or was there only a dead\nbody in the room Was Lord Edgware killedbefore she entered the house\u2014sometime between nine and\nten\u2019\n\u2018Stop Poirot\u2019 I cried.",
    "\u2018You are making my head spin.\u2019\n\u2018No no my friend.",
    "We are only considering possibilities.",
    "It is like trying on the clothes.",
    "Does this fit\nNo it wrinkles on the shoulder This one Yes that is better\u2014but not quite large enough.",
    "This other one\nis too small.",
    "So on and so on\u2014until we reach the perfect fit\u2014the truth.\u2019\n\u2018Who do you suspect of such a fiendish plot\u2019 I asked.",
    "\u2018Ah that is too early to say.",
    "One must go into the question of who has a motive for wishing Lord\nEdgware dead.",
    "There is of course the nephew who inherits.",
    "A little obvious that perhaps.",
    "And then in\nspite of Miss Carroll\u2019s dogmatic pronouncement there is the question of enemies.",
    "Lord Edgware struck\nme as a man who very easily might make enemies.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 I agreed.",
    "\u2018That is so.\u2019\n\u2018Whoever it was must have fancied himself pretty safe.",
    "Remember Hastings but for her change of mind\nat the last minute Jane Wilkinson would have had no alibi.",
    "She might have been in her room at the\nSavoy and it would have been difficult to prove it.",
    "She would have been arrested tried\u2014probably\nhanged.\u2019\nI shivered.",
    "\u2018But there is one thing that puzzles me\u2019 went on Poirot.",
    "\u2018The desire to incriminate her is clear\u2014but what\nthen of the telephone call Why did someone ring her up at Chiswick and once satisfied of her presence\nthere immediately ring off.",
    "It looks does it not as if someone wanted to be sure of her presence there\nbefore proceeding to\u2014what That was at ninethirty almost certainly before the murder.",
    "The intention\nthen seems\u2014there is no other word for it\u2014beneficent.",
    "Itcannot be the murderer who rings up\u2014the\nmurderer has laid all his plans to incriminate Jane.",
    "Who then was it It looks as though we have here\ntwo entirely different sets of circumstances.\u2019\nI shook my head utterly fogged.",
    "\u2018It might be just a coincidence\u2019 I suggested.",
    "\u2018No no everything cannot be a coincidence.",
    "Six months ago a letter was suppressed.",
    "Why There are\ntoo many things here unexplained.",
    "There must be some reason linking them together.\u2019\n\n\fHe sighed.",
    "Presently he went on\n\u2018That story that Bryan Martin came to tell us\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Surely Poirot that has got no connection with this business.\u2019\n\u2018You are blind Hastings blind and wilfully obtuse.",
    "Do you not see that the whole thing makes a pattern\nA pattern confused at present but which will gradually become clear\u2026\u2019\nI felt Poirot was being overoptimistic.",
    "I did not feel that anything would ever become clear.",
    "My brain\nwas frankly reeling.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s no good\u2019 I said suddenly.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t believe it of Carlotta Adams.",
    "She seemed such a\u2014well such a\nthoroughly nice girl.\u2019\nYet even as I spoke I remembered Poirot\u2019s words about love of money.",
    "Love of money\u2014was that at\nthe root of the seemingly incomprehensible I felt that Poirot had been inspired that night.",
    "He had seen\nJane in danger\u2014the result of the strange egotistical temperament.",
    "He had seen Carlotta led astray by\navarice.",
    "\u2018I do not think she committed the murder Hastings.",
    "She is too cool and levelheaded for that.",
    "Possibly\nshe was not even told that murder would be done.",
    "She may have been used innocently.",
    "But then\u2014\u2019\nHe broke off frowning.",
    "\u2018Even so she\u2019s an accessory after the fact now.",
    "I mean she will see the news today.",
    "She will realize\u2014\u2019\nA hoarse sound broke from Poirot.",
    "\u2018Quick Hastings.",
    "Quick I have been blind\u2014imbecile.",
    "A taxi.",
    "At once.\u2019\nI stared at him.",
    "He waved his arms.",
    "\u2018A taxi\u2014at once.\u2019\nOne was passing.",

    "It was a flat in a\nblock of mansions near Sloane Square.",
    "We drove there Poirot in a fever of impatience.",
    "\u2018If I am not too late Hastings.",
    "If I am not too late.\u2019\n\u2018What is all this haste I don\u2019t understand.",
    "What does it mean\u2019\n\u2018It means that I have been slow.",
    "Terribly slow to realize the obvious.",
    "Ahmon Dieu  if only we may be in\ntime.\u2019\nChapter 9\nThe Second Death\nThough I did not understand the reason for Poirot\u2019s agitation I knew him well enough to be sure that he\nhad a reason for it.",

    "Miss\nAdams\u2019 flat was on the first floor as a visitingcard stuck on a board informed us.",
    "Poirot hurried up the stairs not waiting to summon the lift which was at one of the upper floors.",
    "He knocked and rang.",
    "There was a short delay then the door was opened by a neat middleaged\nwoman with hair drawn tightly back from her face.",
    "Her eyelids were reddened as though with weeping.",
    "\u2018Miss Adams\u2019 demanded Poirot eagerly.",

    "His agitation was so apparent that the woman looked at him with more attention.",
    "\u2018Excuse me sir but are you a friend of hers I do not remember seeing you come here before\u2019\nPoirot did not reply to this directly.",
    "Instead he said\n\u2018You have had a doctor What did he say\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Took an overdose of a sleeping draught.",
    "Oh the pity of it Such a nice young lady.",
    "Nasty dangerous\nthings\u2014these drugs.",

    "I think she was pleased about something but just done up if you know what I mean.",
    "She\nstarted to ring someone up on the telephone and then she said she couldn\u2019t bother.",
    "She\u2019d do it\ntomorrow morning.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 Poirot\u2019s eyes gleamed with excitement.",
    "He leaned forward and spoke in a wouldbe indifferent\nvoice.",
    "\u2018Did you hear the name of the person she rang up\u2019\n\n\f\u2018No sir.",
    "She just asked for the number and waited and then the exchange must have said \u201cI\u2019m trying to\nget them\u201d as they do sir and she said \u201cAll right\u201d and then suddenly she yawned and said \u201cOh I can\u2019t\nbother.",
    "I\u2019m too tired\u201d and she put the receiver back and started undressing.\u2019\n\u2018And the number she called Do you recollect that Think.",
    "It may be important.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t say sir.",
    "It was a Victoria number and that\u2019s all I can remember.",
    "I wasn\u2019t paying\nspecial heed you see.\u2019\n\u2018Did she have anything to eat or drink before she went to bed\u2019\n\u2018A glass of hot milk sir like she always did.\u2019\n\u2018Who prepared it\u2019\n\u2018I did sir.\u2019\n\u2018And nobody came to the flat that evening\u2019\n\u2018Nobody sir.\u2019\n\u2018And earlier in the day\u2019\n\u2018Nobody came that I can remember sir.",
    "Miss Adams was out to lunch and tea.",
    "She came in at six\no\u2019clock.\u2019\n\u2018When did the milk come The milk she drank last night\u2019\n\u2018It was the new milk she had sir.",
    "The afternoon delivery.",
    "The boy leaves it outside the door at four\no\u2019clock.",
    "But oh sir I\u2019m sure there wasn\u2019t nothing wrong with the milk.",
    "I had it myself for tea this\nmorning.",
    "And the doctor he said positive as she\u2019d taken the nasty stuff herself.\u2019\n\u2018It is possible that I am wrong\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Yes it is possible that I am entirely wrong.",
    "I will see the\ndoctor.",
    "But you see Miss Adams had enemies.",
    "Things are very different in America\u2014\u2019\nHe hesitated but the good Alice leapt at the bait.",
    "\u2018Oh I know sir.",
    "I\u2019ve read about Chicago and them gunmen and all that.",
    "It must be a wicked country\nand what the police can be about I can\u2019t think.",
    "Not like our policemen.\u2019\nPoirot left it thankfully at that realizing that Alice Bennett\u2019s insular proclivities would save him the trouble\nof explanations.",
    "His eye fell on a small suitcase\u2014more of an attach\u00e9 case that was lying on a chair.",
    "\u2018Did Miss Adams take that with her when she went out last night\u2019\n\u2018In the morning she took it sir.",
    "She didn\u2019t have it when she came back at teatime but she brought it\nback last thing.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Ah You permit that I open it\u2019\nAlice Bennett would have permitted anything.",
    "Like most canny and suspicious women once she had\novercome her distrust she was child\u2019s play to manipulate.",
    "She would have assented to anything Poirot\nsuggested.",
    "The case was not locked Poirot opened it.",
    "I came forward and looked over his shoulder.",
    "\u2018You see Hastings you see\u2019 he murmured excitedly.",
    "The contents were certainly suggestive.",
    "There was a box of makeup materials two objects which I recognized as elevators to place in shoes\nand raise the height an inch or so there was a pair of grey gloves and folded in tissue paper an\nexquisitelymade wig of golden hair the exact shade of gold of Jane Wilkinson\u2019s and dressed like hers\nwith a centre parting and curls in the back of the neck.",
    "\u2018Do you doubt now Hastings\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "I believe I had up to that moment.",
    "But now I doubted no longer.",
    "Poirot closed the case again and turned to the maid.",
    "\u2018You do not know with whom Miss Adams dined yesterday evening\u2019\n\u2018No sir.\u2019\n\u2018Do you know with whom she had lunch or tea\u2019\n\u2018I know nothing about tea sir.",
    "I believe she lunched with Miss Driver.\u2019\n\u2018Miss Driver\u2019\n\u2018Yes her great friend.",
    "She has a hat shop in Moffat Street just off Bond Street.",
    "Genevieve it\u2019s called.\u2019\nPoirot noted the address in his notebook just below that of the doctor.",
    "\u2018One thing more Madame.",
    "Can you remember anything\u2014anything at all\u2014that Mademoiselle Adams\nsaid or did after she came in at six o\u2019clock that strikes you as at all unusual or significant\u2019\nThe maid thought for a moment or two.",
    "\u2018I really can\u2019t say that I do sir\u2019 she said at last.",
    "\u2018I asked her if she would have tea and she said she\u2019d\nhad some.\u2019\n\u2018Oh she said she had had it\u2019 interrupted Poirot.",
    "\u2018Pardon.",
    "Continue.\u2019\n\u2018And after that she was writing letters till just on the time she went out.\u2019\n\u2018Letters eh You do not know to whom\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Yes sir.",
    "It was just one letter\u2014to her sister in Washington.",
    "She wrote to her sister twice a week\nregular.",
    "She took the letter out with her to post because of catching the mail.",
    "But she forgot it.\u2019\n\u2018Then it is here still\u2019\n\u2018No sir.",
    "I posted it.",
    "She remembered last night just as she was getting into bed.",
    "And I said I\u2019d run out\nwith it.",
    "By putting an extra stamp on it and putting it in the late fee box it would be all right.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2014and is that far\u2019\n\u2018No sir the post office is just around the corner.\u2019\n\u2018Did you shut the door of the flat behind you\u2019\nBennett stared.",
    "\u2018No sir.",
    "I just left it to\u2014as I always do when I go out to post.\u2019\nPoirot seemed about to speak\u2014then checked himself.",
    "\u2018Would you like to look at her sir\u2019 asked the maid tearfully.",
    "\u2018Looks beautiful she does.\u2019\nWe followed her into the bedroom.",
    "Carlotta Adams looked strangely peaceful and much younger than she had appeared that night at the\nSavoy.",
    "She looked like a tired child asleep.",
    "There was a strange expression on Poirot\u2019s face as he stood looking down on her.",
    "I saw him make the\nsign of the Cross.",
    "\u2018J\u2019ai fait un serment Hastings\u2019 he said as we went down the stairs.",
    "I did not ask him what his vow was.",
    "I could guess.",
    "A minute or two later he said\n\u2018There is one thing off my mind at least.",
    "I could not have saved her.",
    "By the time I heard of Lord\nEdgware\u2019s death she was already dead.",
    "That comforts me.",
    "Yes that comforts me very much.\u2019\nChapter 10\nJenny Driver\nOur next proceeding was to call upon the doctor whose address the maid had given us.",
    "He turned out to be a fussy elderly man somewhat vague in manner.",
    "He knew Poirot by repute and\nexpressed a lively pleasure at meeting him in the flesh.",
    "\u2018And what can I do for you M. Poirot\u2019 he asked after this opening preamble.",
    "\u2018You were called this morning M.le docteur  to the bedside of a Miss Carlotta Adams.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Ah yes poor girl.",
    "Clever actress too.",
    "I\u2019ve been twice to her show.",
    "A thousand pities it\u2019s ended this\nway.",
    "Why these girls must have drugs I can\u2019t think.\u2019\n\u2018You think she was addicted to drugs then\u2019\n\u2018Well professionally I should hardly have said so.",
    "At all events she didn\u2019t take them hypodermically.",
    "No marks of the needle.",
    "Evidently always took it by the mouth.",
    "Maid said she slept well naturally but\nthen maids never know.",
    "I don\u2019t suppose she took veronal every night but she\u2019d evidently taken it for\nsome time.\u2019\n\u2018What makes you think so\u2019\n\u2018This dash it\u2014where did I put the thing\u2019\nHe was peering into a small case.",
    "\u2018Ah here it is.\u2019\nHe drew out a small black morocco handbag.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s got to be an inquest of course.",
    "I brought this away so that the maid shouldn\u2019t meddle with it.\u2019\nOpening the pochette he took out a small gold box.",
    "On it were the initials C.A.",
    "in rubies.",
    "It was a\nvaluable and expensive trinket.",
    "The doctor opened it.",
    "It was nearly full of a white powder.",
    "\u2018Veronal\u2019 he explained briefly.",
    "\u2018Now look what\u2019s written inside.\u2019\nOn the inside of the lid of the box was engraved\nC.A.",
    "from D. Paris Nov. 10th.",
    "Sweet Dreams.",
    "\u2018November 10th\u2019 said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018Exactly and we\u2019re now in June.",
    "That seems to show that she\u2019s been in the habit of taking the stuff for at\nleast six months and as the year isn\u2019t given it might be eighteen months or two years and a half\u2014or any\ntime.\u2019\n\u2018Paris.",
    "D\u2019 said Poirot frowning.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "Convey anything to you By the way I haven\u2019t asked you what your interest is in the case.",
    "I\u2019m\nassuming you\u2019ve got good grounds.",
    "I suppose you want to know if it\u2019s suicide Well I can\u2019t tell you.",
    "Nobody can.",
    "According to the maid\u2019s account she was perfectly cheerful yesterday.",
    "That looks like\naccident and in my opinion accident it is.",
    "Veronal\u2019s very uncertain stuff.",
    "You can take a devil of a lot and\nit won\u2019t kill you and you can take very little and off you go.",
    "It\u2019s a dangerous drug for that reason.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve no doubt they\u2019ll bring it in Accidental Death at the inquest.",
    "I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t be of any more help to\nyou.\u2019\n\u2018May I examine the little bag of Mademoiselle\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Certainly.",
    "Certainly.\u2019\nPoirot turned out the contents of the pochette.",
    "There was a fine handkerchief with C.M.A.",
    "in the corner\na powder puff a lipstick a pound note and a little change and a pair of pincenez.",
    "These last Poirot examined with interest.",
    "They were goldrimmed and rather severe and academic in\ntype.",
    "\u2018Curious\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018I did not know that Miss Adams wore glasses.",
    "But perhaps they are for\nreading\u2019\nThe doctor picked them up.",
    "\u2018No these are outdoor glasses\u2019 he affirmed.",
    "\u2018Pretty powerful too.",
    "The person who wore these must\nhave been very shortsighted.\u2019\n\u2018You do not know if Miss Adams\u2014\u2019\n\u2018I never attended her before.",
    "I was called in once to see a poisoned finger of the maid\u2019s.",
    "Otherwise I\nhave never been in the flat.",
    "Miss Adams whom I saw for a moment on that occasion was certainly not\nwearing glasses then.\u2019\nPoirot thanked the doctor and we took our leave.",
    "Poirot wore a puzzled expression.",
    "\u2018It can be that I am mistaken\u2019 he admitted.",
    "\u2018About the impersonation\u2019\n\u2018No no.",
    "That seems to me proved.",
    "No I mean as to her death.",
    "Obviously she had veronal in her\npossession.",
    "It is possible that she was tired and strung up last night and determined to ensure herself a\ngood night\u2019s rest.\u2019\nThen he suddenly stopped dead\u2014to the great surprise of the passersby\u2014and beat one hand\nemphatically on the other.",
    "\u2018No no no no\u2019 he declared emphatically.",
    "\u2018Why should that accident happen so conveniently It was\nno accident.",
    "It was not suicide.",
    "No she played her part and in doing so she signed her death warrant.",
    "Veronal may have been chosen simply because it was known that she occasionally took it and that she\nhad that box in her possession.",
    "But if so the murderer must have been someone who knew her well.",
    "Who is D Hastings I would give a good deal to know who D was.\u2019\n\u2018Poirot\u2019 I said as he remained rapt in thought.",
    "\u2018Hadn\u2019t we better go on Everyone is staring at us.\u2019\n\u2018Eh Well perhaps you are right.",
    "Though it does not incommode me that people should stare.",
    "It does\nnot interfere in the least with my train of thought.\u2019\n\u2018People were beginning to laugh\u2019 I murmured.",
    "\u2018That has no importance.\u2019\n\n\fI did not quite agree.",
    "I have a horror of doing anything conspicuous.",
    "The only thing that affects Poirot is\nthe possibility of the damp or the heat affecting the set of his famous moustache.",
    "\u2018We will take a taxi\u2019 said Poirot waving his stick.",
    "One drew up by us and Poirot directed it to go Genevieve in Moffat Street.",
    "Genevieve turned out to be one of those establishments where one nondescript hat and a scarf display\nthemselves in a glass box downstairs and where the real centre of operations is one floor up a flight of\nmustysmelling stairs.",
    "Having climbed the stairs we came to a door with \u2018Genevieve.",
    "Please Walk In\u2019 on it and having obeyed\nthis command we found ourselves in a small room full of hats while an imposing blonde creature came\nforward with a suspicious glance at Poirot.",
    "\u2018Miss Driver\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "\u2018I do not know if Modom can see you.",
    "What is your business please\u2019\n\u2018Please tell Miss Driver that a friend of Miss Adams would like to see her.\u2019\nThe blonde beauty had no need to go on this errand.",
    "A black velvet curtain was violently agitated and a\nsmall vivacious creature with flaming red hair emerged.",
    "\u2018What\u2019s that\u2019 she demanded.",
    "\u2018Are you Miss Driver\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "What\u2019s that about Carlotta\u2019\n\u2018You have heard the sad news\u2019\n\u2018What sad news\u2019\n\u2018Miss Adams died in her sleep last night.",
    "An overdose of veronal.\u2019\nThe girl\u2019s eyes opened wide.",
    "\u2018How awful\u2019 she exclaimed.",
    "\u2018Poor Carlotta.",
    "I can hardly believe it.",
    "Why she was full of life yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018Nevertheless it is true Mademoiselle\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Now see\u2014it is just on one o\u2019clock.",
    "I want you to\ndo me the honour of coming out to lunch with me and my friend.",
    "I want to ask you several questions.\u2019\nThe girl looked him up and down.",
    "She was a pugilistic little creature.",
    "She reminded me in some ways of\na fox terrier.",
    "\u2018Who are you\u2019 she demanded bluntly.",
    "\u2018My name is Hercule Poirot.",
    "This is my friend Captain Hastings.\u2019\n\n\fI bowed.",
    "Her glance travelled from one to the other of us.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve heard of you\u2019 she said abruptly.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll come.\u2019\nShe called to the blonde\n\u2018Dorothy\u2019\n\u2018Yes Jenny.\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Lester\u2019s coming in about that Rose Descartes model we\u2019re making for her.",
    "Try the different\nfeathers.",
    "Byebye shan\u2019t be long I expect.\u2019\nShe picked up a small black hat affixed it to one ear powdered her nose furiously and then looked at\nPoirot.",
    "\u2018Ready\u2019 she said abruptly.",
    "Five minutes afterwards we were sitting in a small restaurant in Dover Street.",
    "Poirot had given an order\nto the waiter and cocktails were in front of us.",
    "\u2018Now\u2019 said Jenny Driver.",
    "\u2018I want to know the meaning of all this.",
    "What has Carlotta been getting herself\nmixed up in\u2019\n\u2018She had been getting herself mixed up in something then Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018Now then who is going to ask the questions you or me\u2019\n\u2018My idea was that I should\u2019 said Poirot smiling.",
    "\u2018I have been given to understand that you and Miss\nAdams were great friends.\u2019\n\u2018Right.\u2019\n\u2018Eh bien then I ask you Mademoiselle to accept my solemn assurance that what I do I am doing in the\ninterests of your dead friend.",
    "I assure you that that is so.\u2019\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence while Jenny Driver considered this question.",
    "Finally she gave a quick\nassenting nod of the head.",
    "\u2018I believe you.",
    "Carry on.",
    "What do you want to know\u2019\n\u2018I understand Mademoiselle that your friend lunched with you yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018She did.\u2019\n\u2018Did she tell you what her plans were for last night\u2019\n\u2018She didn\u2019t exactly mention last night.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018But she said something\u2019\n\u2018Well she mentioned something that maybe is what you\u2019re driving at.",
    "Mind you she spoke in\nconfidence.\u2019\n\u2018That is understood.\u2019\n\u2018Well let me see now.",
    "I think I\u2019d better explain things in my own words.\u2019\n\u2018If you please Mademoiselle.\u2019\n\u2018Well then Carlotta was excited.",
    "She isn\u2019t often excited.",
    "She\u2019s not that kind.",
    "She wouldn\u2019t tell me\nanything definite said she\u2019d promised not to but she\u2019d got something on.",
    "Something I gathered in the\nnature of a gigantic hoax.\u2019\n\u2018A hoax\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what she said.",
    "She didn\u2019t say how or when or where.",
    "Only\u2014\u2019 She paused frowning.",
    "\u2018Well\u2014you see\u2014Carlotta\u2019s not the kind of person who enjoys practical jokes or hoaxes or things of\nthat kind.",
    "She\u2019s one of those serious niceminded hardworking girls.",
    "What I mean is somebody had\nobviously put her up to this stunt.",
    "And I think\u2014she didn\u2019t say so mind\u2014\u2019\n\u2018No no I quite understand.",
    "What was it that you thought\u2019\n\u2018I thought\u2014I was sure\u2014that in some way money was concerned.",
    "Nothing really ever excited Carlotta\nexcept money.",
    "She was made that way.",
    "She\u2019d got one of the best heads for business I\u2019ve ever met.",
    "She\nwouldn\u2019t have been so excited and so pleased unless money\u2014quite a lot of money\u2014had been\nconcerned.",
    "My impression was that she\u2019d taken on something for a bet\u2014and that she was pretty sure of\nwinning.",
    "And yet that isn\u2019t quite true.",
    "I mean Carlotta didn\u2019t bet.",
    "I\u2019ve never known her make a bet.",
    "But\nanyway somehow or other I\u2019m sure money was concerned.\u2019\n\u2018She did not actually say so\u2019\n\u2018Nnoo.",
    "Just said that she\u2019d be able to do this that and the other in the near future.",
    "She was going to\nget her sister over from America to meet her in Paris.",
    "She was crazy about her little sister.",
    "Very delicate\nI believe and musical.",
    "Well that\u2019s all I know.",
    "Is that what you want\u2019\nPoirot nodded his head.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "It confirms my theory.",
    "I had hoped I admit for more.",
    "I had anticipated that Miss Adams would\nhave been bound to secrecy.",
    "But I hoped that being a woman she would not have counted revealing the\nsecret to her best friend.\u2019\n\u2018I tried to make her tell me\u2019 admitted Jenny.",
    "\u2018But she only laughed and said she\u2019d tell me about it some\nday.\u2019\nPoirot was silent for a moment.",
    "Then he said\n\u2018You know the name of Lord Edgware\u2019\n\u2018What The man who was murdered On a poster half an hour ago.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Yes.",
    "Do you know if Miss Adams was acquainted with him\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so.",
    "I\u2019m sure she wasn\u2019t.",
    "Oh wait a minute.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Mademoiselle\u2019 said Poirot eagerly.",
    "\u2018What was it now\u2019 She frowned knitting her brow as she tried to remember.",
    "\u2018Yes I\u2019ve got it now.",
    "She\nmentioned him once.",
    "Very bitterly.\u2019\n\u2018Bitterly\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "She said\u2014what was it\u2014that men like that shouldn\u2019t be allowed to ruin other people\u2019s lives by\ntheir cruelty and lack of understanding.",
    "She said\u2014why so she did\u2014that he was the kind of man whose\ndeath would probably be a good thing for everybody.\u2019\n\u2018When was it she said this Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018Oh about a month ago I think it was.\u2019\n\u2018How did the subject come up\u2019\nJenny Driver racked her brains for some minutes and finally shook her head.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t remember\u2019 she confessed.",
    "\u2018His name cropped up or something.",
    "It might have been in the\nnewspaper.",
    "Anyway I remember thinking it odd that Carlotta should be so vehement all of a sudden\nwhen she didn\u2019t even know the man.\u2019\n\u2018Certainly it is odd\u2019 agreed Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Then he asked\n\u2018Do you know if Miss Adams was in the habit of taking veronal\u2019\n\u2018Not that I knew.",
    "I never saw her take it or mention taking it.\u2019\n\u2018Did you ever see in her bag a small gold box with the initials C.A.",

    "I am sure I didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Do you happen to know where Miss Adams was last November\u2019\n\u2018Let me see.",
    "She went back to the States in November I think\u2014towards the end of the month.",
    "Before\nthat she was in Paris.\u2019\n\u2018Alone\u2019\n\u2018Alone of course Sorry\u2014perhaps you didn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t know why any mention of Paris always\nsuggests the worst.",
    "And it\u2019s such a nice respectable place really.",
    "But Carlotta wasn\u2019t the weekending\nsort if that\u2019s what you\u2019re driving at.\u2019\n\u2018Now Mademoiselle I am going to ask you a very important question.",
    "Was there any man Miss Adams\nwas specially interested in\u2019\n\n\f\u2018The answer to that is \u201cNo\u201d\u2019 said Jenny slowly.",
    "\u2018Carlotta since I\u2019ve known her has been wrapped up\nin her work and in her delicate sister.",
    "She\u2019s had the \u201chead of the family all depends on me\u201d attitude very\nstrongly.",
    "So the answer\u2019s NO\u2014strictly speaking.\u2019\n\u2018Ah and not speaking so strictly\u2019\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t wonder if\u2014lately\u2014Carlotta hadn\u2019t been getting interested in some man.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019\n\u2018Mind you that\u2019s entirely guesswork on my part.",
    "I\u2019ve gone simply by her manner.",
    "She\u2019s\nbeen\u2014different\u2014not exactly dreamy but abstracted.",
    "And she\u2019s looked different somehow.",
    "Oh I can\u2019t\nexplain.",
    "It\u2019s the sort of thing that another woman just feels\u2014and of course may be quite wrong about.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018Thank you Mademoiselle.",
    "One thing more.",
    "Is there any friend of Miss Adams whose initial is D\u2019\n\u2018D\u2019 said Jenny Driver thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018D No I\u2019m sorry.",
    "I can\u2019t think of anyone.\u2019\nChapter 11\nThe Egoist\nI do not think Poirot had expected any other answer to his question.",
    "All the same he shook his head\nsadly.",
    "He remained lost in thought.",
    "Jenny Driver leant forward her elbows on the table.",
    "\u2018And now\u2019 she said \u2018am I going to be told anything\u2019\n\u2018Mademoiselle\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018First of all let me compliment you.",
    "Your answers to my questions have\nbeen singularly intelligent.",
    "Clearly you have brains Mademoiselle.",
    "You ask whether I am going to tell you\nanything.",
    "I answer\u2014not very much.",
    "I will tell you just a few bare facts Mademoiselle.\u2019\nHe paused and then said quietly\n\u2018Last night Lord Edgware was murdered in his library.",
    "At ten o\u2019clock yesterday evening a lady whom I\nbelieve to have been your friend Miss Adams came to the house asked to see Lord Edgware and\nannounced herself as Lady Edgware.",
    "She wore a golden wig and was made up to resemble the real Lady\nEdgware who as you probably know is Miss Jane Wilkinson the actress.",
    "Miss Adams if it were she\nonly remained a few moments.",
    "She left the house at five minutes past ten but she did not return home till\nafter midnight.",
    "She went to bed having taken an overdose of veronal.",
    "Now Mademoiselle you see the\npoint perhaps of some of the questions I have been asking you.\u2019\nJenny drew a deep breath.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 she said \u2018I see now.",
    "I believe you\u2019re right M. Poirot.",
    "Right about its having been Carlotta I\nmean.",
    "For one thing she bought a new hat off me yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018A new hat\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Yes.",
    "She said she wanted one to shade the left side of her face.\u2019\nThere I must insert a few words of explanation as I do not know when these words will be read.",
    "I have\nseen many fashions of hats in my time\u2014the cloche that shaded the face so completely that one gave up in\ndespair the task of recognizing one\u2019s friends.",
    "The tilted forward hat the hat attached airily to the back of\nthe head the beret and many other styles.",
    "In this particular June the hat of the moment was shaped like\nan inverted soup plate and was worn attached as if by suction over one ear leaving the other side of the\nface and hair open to inspection.",
    "\u2018These hats are usually worn on the right side of the head\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "The little modiste nodded.",
    "\u2018But we keep a few to be worn on the opposite side\u2019 she explained.",
    "\u2018Because there are people who\nmuch prefer their right profile to the left or who have a habit of parting the hair on one side only.",
    "Now\nwould there be any special reason for Carlotta\u2019s wanting that side of her face to be in shadow\u2019\nI remembered that the door of the house in Regent Gate opened to the left so that anyone entering\nwould be in full view of the butler that side.",
    "I remembered also that Jane Wilkinson so I had noticed the\nother night had a tiny mole at the corner of the left eye.",
    "I said as much excitedly.",
    "Poirot agreed nodding his head vigorously.",
    "\u2018It is so.",
    "It is so.Vous avez parfaitement raison  Hastings.",
    "Yes that explains the purchase of the hat.\u2019\n\u2018M.",
    "Poirot\u2019 Jenny sat suddenly bolt upright.",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t think\u2014you don\u2019t for one moment think\u2014that\nCarlotta did it Kill him I mean.",
    "You can\u2019t think that Not just because she spoke so bitterly about him.\u2019\n\u2018I do not think so.",
    "But it is curious all the same\u2014that she should have spoken so I mean.",
    "I would like\nto know the reason for it.",
    "What had he done\u2014what did she know of him to make her speak in such a\nfashion\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2014but she didn\u2019t kill him.",
    "She\u2019s\u2014oh she was\u2014well\u2014too refined.\u2019\nPoirot nodded approvingly.",
    "\u2018Yes yes.",
    "You put that very well.",
    "It is a point psychological.",
    "I agree.",
    "This was a scientific crime\u2014but\nnot a refined one.\u2019\n\u2018Scientific\u2019\n\u2018The murderer knew exactly where to strike so as to reach the vital nerve centres at the base of the skull\nwhere it joins the cord.\u2019\n\u2018Looks like a doctor\u2019 said Jenny thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018Did Miss Adams know any doctors I mean was any particular doctor a friend of hers\u2019\nJenny shook her head.",
    "\u2018Never heard of one.",
    "Not over here anyway.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Another question.",
    "Did Miss Adams wear pincenez\u2019\n\u2018Glasses Never.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 Poirot frowned.",
    "A vision rose in my mind.",
    "A doctor smelling of carbolic with shortsighted eyes magnified by powerful\nlenses.",
    "Absurd\n\u2018By the way did Miss Adams know Bryan Martin the film actor\u2019\n\u2018Why yes.",
    "She used to know him as a child she told me.",
    "I don\u2019t think she saw much of him though.",
    "Just once in a while.",
    "She told me she thought he\u2019d got very swollenheaded.\u2019\nShe looked at her watch and uttered an exclamation.",
    "\u2018Goodness I must fly.",
    "Have I helped you at all M. Poirot\u2019\n\u2018You have.",
    "I shall ask you for further help by and by.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s yours.",
    "Someone staged this devilry.",
    "We\u2019ve got to find out who it is.\u2019\nShe gave us a quick shake of the hand flashed her white teeth in a sudden smile and left us with\ncharacteristic abruptness.",
    "\u2018An interesting personality\u2019 said Poirot as he paid the bill.",
    "\u2018I like her\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018It is always a pleasure to meet a quick mind.\u2019\n\u2018A little hard perhaps\u2019 I reflected.",
    "\u2018The shock of her friend\u2019s death did not upset her as much as I\nshould have thought it would have done.\u2019\n\u2018She is not the sort that weeps certainly\u2019 agreed Poirot dryly.",
    "\u2018Did you get what you hoped from the interview\u2019\nHe shook his head.",
    "\u2018No\u2014I hoped\u2014very much I hoped\u2014to get a clue to the personality of D the person who gave her the\nlittle gold box.",
    "There I have failed.",
    "Unfortunately Carlotta Adams was a reserved girl.",
    "She was not one to\ngossip about her friends or her possible love affairs.",
    "On the other hand the person who suggested the\nhoax may not have been a friend at all.",
    "It may have been a mere acquaintance who proposed\nit\u2014doubtless for some \u201csporting\u201d reason\u2014on a money basis.",
    "This person may have seen the gold box\nshe carried about with her and made some opportunity to discover what it contained.\u2019\n\u2018But how on earth did they get her to take it And when\u2019\n\u2018Well there was the time during which the flat door was open\u2014when the maid was out posting a letter.",
    "Not that that satisfies me.",
    "It leaves too much to chance.",
    "But now\u2014to work.",
    "We have still two possible\nclues.\u2019\n\u2018Which are\u2019\n\u2018The first is the telephone call to a Victoria number.",
    "It seems to me quite a probability that Carlotta\nAdams would ring up on her return to announce her success.",
    "On the other hand where was she between\nfive minutes past ten and midnight She may have had an appointment with the instigator of the hoax.",
    "In\nthat case the telephone call may have been merely one to a friend.\u2019\n\u2018What is the second clue\u2019\n\u2018Ah that I do have hopes of.",
    "The letter Hastings.",
    "The letter to her sister.",
    "It is possible\u2014I only say\npossible\u2014that in that she may have described the whole business.",
    "She would not regard it as a breach of\nfaith since the letter would not be read till a week later and in another country at that.\u2019\n\u2018Amazing if that is so\u2019\n\u2018We must not build too much upon it Hastings.",
    "It is a chance that is all.",
    "No we must work now from\nthe other end.\u2019\n\u2018What do you call the other end\u2019\n\u2018A careful study of those who profit in any degree by Lord Edgware\u2019s death.\u2019\nI shrugged my shoulders.",
    "\u2018Apart from his nephew and his wife\u2014\u2019\n\u2018And the man the wife wanted to marry\u2019 added Poirot.",
    "\u2018The Duke He is in Paris.\u2019\n\u2018Quite so.",
    "But you cannot deny that he is an interested party.",
    "Then there are the people in the\nhouse\u2014the butler\u2014the servants.",
    "Who knows what grudges they may have had But I think myself our\nfirst point of attack should be a further interview with Mademoiselle Jane Wilkinson.",
    "She is shrewd.",
    "She\nmay be able to suggest something.\u2019\nOnce more we made our way to the Savoy.",
    "We found the lady surrounded by boxes and tissue paper\nwhilst exquisite black draperies were strewn over the back of every chair.",
    "Jane had a rapt and serious\nexpression and was just trying on yet another small black hat before the glass.",
    "\u2018Why M. Poirot.",
    "Sit down.",
    "That is if there\u2019s anything to sit on.",
    "Ellis clear something will you\u2019\n\u2018Madame.",
    "You look charming.\u2019\nJane looked serious.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t want exactly to play the hypocrite M. Poirot.",
    "But one must observe appearances don\u2019t you\nthink I mean I think I ought to be careful.",
    "Oh by the way I\u2019ve had the sweetest telegram from the\nDuke.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018From Paris\u2019\n\u2018Yes from Paris.",
    "Guarded of course and supposed to be condolences but put so that I can read\nbetween the lines.\u2019\n\u2018My felicitations Madame.\u2019\n\u2018M.",
    "Poirot.\u2019 She clasped her hands her husky voice dropped.",
    "She looked like an angel about to give\nvent to thoughts of exquisite holiness.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve been thinking.",
    "It all seems somiraculous  if you know what I\nmean.",
    "Here I am\u2014all my troubles over.",
    "No tiresome business of divorce.",
    "No bothers.",
    "Just my path\ncleared and all plain sailing.",
    "It makes me feel almost religious\u2014if you know what I mean.\u2019\nI held my breath.",
    "Poirot looked at her his head a little on one side.",
    "She was quite serious.",
    "\u2018That is how it strikes you Madame eh\u2019\n\u2018Things happen right for me\u2019 said Jane in a sort of awed whisper.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve thought and I\u2019ve thought\nlately\u2014if Edgware was to die.",
    "And there\u2014he\u2019s dead It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s almost like an answer to prayer.\u2019\nPoirot cleared his throat.",
    "\u2018I cannot say I look at it quite like that Madame.",
    "Somebody killed your husband.\u2019\nShe nodded.",
    "\u2018Why of course.\u2019\n\u2018Has it not occurred to you to wonder who that someone was\u2019\nShe stared at him.",
    "\u2018Does it matter I mean\u2014what\u2019s that to do with it The Duke and I can be married in\nabout four or five months\u2026\u2019\nWith difficulty Poirot controlled himself.",
    "\u2018Yes Madame I know that.",
    "But apart from that has it not occurred to you to ask yourselfwho killed\nyour husband \u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019 She seemed quite surprised by the idea.",
    "We could see her thinking about it.",
    "\u2018Does it not interest you to know\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "\u2018Not very much I\u2019m afraid\u2019 she admitted.",
    "\u2018I suppose the police will find out.",
    "They\u2019re very clever aren\u2019t\nthey\u2019\n\u2018So it is said.",
    "I too am going to make it my business to find out.\u2019\n\u2018Are you How funny.\u2019\n\u2018Why funny\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Well I don\u2019t know.\u2019 Her eyes strayed back to the clothes.",
    "She slipped on a satin coat and studied\nherself in the glass.",
    "\u2018You do not object eh\u2019 said Poirot his eyes twinkling.",
    "\u2018Why of course not M. Poirot.",
    "I should just love you to be clever about it all.",
    "I wish you every\nsuccess.\u2019\n\u2018Madame\u2014I want your more than wishes.",
    "I want your opinion.\u2019\n\u2018Opinion\u2019 said Jane absently as she twisted her head over her shoulder.",
    "\u2018What on\u2019\n\u2018Who do you think likely to have killed Lord Edgware\u2019\nJane shook her head.",
    "\u2018I haven\u2019t any idea\u2019\nShe wriggled her shoulders experimentally and took up the handglass.",
    "\u2018Madame\u2019 said Poirot in a loud emphatic voice.",
    "\u2018Who DOyou THINK KILLED YOUR\nHUSBAND\u2019\nThis time it got through.",
    "Jane threw him a startled glance.",
    "\u2018Geraldine I expect\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Who is Geraldine\u2019\nBut Jane\u2019s attention was gone again.",
    "\u2018Ellis take this up a little on the right shoulder.",
    "So.",
    "What M. Poirot Geraldine\u2019s his daughter.",
    "No Ellis\ntheright shoulder.",
    "That\u2019s better.",
    "Oh must you go M. Poirot I\u2019m terribly grateful for everything.",
    "I mean\nfor the divorce even though it isn\u2019t necessary after all.",
    "I shall always think you were wonderful.\u2019\nI only saw Jane Wilkinson twice again.",
    "Once on the stage once when I sat opposite her at a luncheon\nparty.",
    "I always think of her as I saw her then absorbed heart and soul in clothes her lips carelessly\nthrowing out the words that were to influence Poirot\u2019s further actions her mind concentrated firmly and\nbeautifully on herself.",
    "\u2018Epatant\u2019 said Poirot with reverence as we emerged into the Strand.",
    "Chapter 12\nThe Daughter\nThere was a letter sent by hand lying on the table when we got back to our rooms.",
    "Poirot picked it up\nslit it open with his usual neatness and then laughed.",
    "\u2018What is it you say\u2014\u201cTalk of the devil\u201d See here Hastings.\u2019\nI took the note from him.",
    "The paper was stamped 17 Regent Gate and was written in very upright characteristic handwriting which\nlooked easy to read and curiously enough was not.",
    "\u2018Dear Sirit ran\nI hear you were at the house this morning with the inspector.",
    "I am sorry not to have had the opportunity\nof speaking to you.",
    "If convenient to yourself I should be much obliged if you could spare me a few\nminutes any time this afternoon.",
    "Yours truly\nGeraldine Marsh.\u2019\n\u2018Curious\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018I wonder why she wants to see you\u2019\n\u2018Is it curious that she should want to see me You are not polite my friend.\u2019\nPoirot has the most irritating habit of joking at the wrong moment.",
    "\u2018We will go round at once my friend\u2019 he said and lovingly brushing an imagined speck of dust from his\nhat he put it on his head.",
    "Jane Wilkinson\u2019s careless suggestion that Geraldine might have killed her father seemed to me\nparticularly absurd.",
    "Only a particularly brainless person could have suggested it.",
    "I said as much to Poirot.",
    "\u2018Brains.",
    "Brains.",
    "What do we really mean by the term In your idiom you would say that Jane Wilkinson\nhas the brains of a rabbit.",
    "That is a term of disparagement.",
    "But consider the rabbit for a moment.",
    "He\nexists and multiplies does he not That in Nature is a sign of mental superiority.",
    "The lovely Lady\nEdgware she does not know history or geography nor the classicssans doute .",
    "The name of Lao Tse\nwould suggest to her a prize Pekingese dog the name of Moli\u00e8re amaison de couture .",
    "But when it\ncomes to choosing clothes to making rich and advantageous marriages and to getting her own way\u2014her\nsuccess is phenomenal.",
    "The opinion of a philosopher as to who murdered Lord Edgware would be no\ngood to me\u2014the motive for murder from a philosopher\u2019s point of view would be the greatest good of the\ngreatest number and as that is difficult to decide few philosophers are murderers.",
    "But a careless opinion\nfrom Lady Edgwaremight be useful to me because her point of view would be materialistic and based on\na knowledge of the worst side of human nature.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps there\u2019s something in that\u2019 I conceded.",
    "\u2018Nous voici\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018I am curious to know why the young lady wishes so urgently to see me.\u2019\n\u2018It is a natural desire\u2019 I said getting my own back.",
    "\u2018You said so a quarter of an hour ago.",
    "The natural\ndesire to see something unique at close quarters.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps it is you my friend who make an impression on her heart the other day\u2019 replied Poirot as he\nrang the bell.",
    "I recalled the startled face of the girl who had stood in the doorway.",
    "I could still see those burning dark\neyes in the white face.",
    "That momentary glimpse had made a great impression on me.",
    "We were shown upstairs to a big drawingroom and in a minute or two Geraldine Marsh came to us\nthere.",
    "The impression of intensity which I had noticed before was heightened on this occasion.",
    "This tall thin\nwhitefaced girl with her big haunting black eyes was a striking figure.",
    "She was extremely composed\u2014in view of her youth remarkably so.",
    "\u2018It is very good of you to come so promptly M. Poirot\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I am sorry to have missed you this\nmorning.\u2019\n\u2018You were lying down\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",

    "She has been very kind.\u2019\nThere was a queer grudging note in the girl\u2019s voice that puzzled me.",
    "\u2018In what way can I be of service to you Mademoiselle\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "She hesitated a minute and then said\n\u2018On the day before my father was killed you came to see him\u2019\n\u2018Yes Mademoiselle.\u2019\n\u2018Why Did he\u2014send for you\u2019\nPoirot did not reply for a moment.",
    "He seemed to be deliberating.",
    "I believe now that it was a cleverly\ncalculated move on his part.",

    "Tell me.",
    "I must know.",
    "Who was he afraid of Why What did he\nsay to you Oh why can\u2019t you speak\u2019\nI had thought that that forced composure was not natural.",
    "It had soon broken down.",
    "She was leaning\nforward now her hands twisting themselves nervously on her lap.",
    "\u2018What passed between Lord Edgware and myself was in confidence\u2019 said Poirot slowly.",
    "His eyes never left her face.",
    "\u2018Then it was about\u2014I mean it must have been something to do with\u2014the family.",
    "Oh you sit there and\ntorture me.",
    "Why won\u2019t you tell me It\u2019s necessary for me to know.",
    "It\u2019s necessary.",
    "I tell you.\u2019\nAgain very slowly Poirot shook his head apparently a prey to deep perplexity.",
    "\u2018M.",
    "Poirot.\u2019 She drew herself up.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m his daughter.",
    "It is my right to know\u2014what my father dreaded on\nthe last day but one of his life.",

    "\u2018Fond of him\u2019 she whispered.",
    "\u2018Fond of him.",
    "I\u2014I\u2014\u2019\n\n\fAnd suddenly her selfcontrol snapped.",
    "Peals of laughter broke from her.",
    "She lay back in her chair and\nlaughed and laughed.",

    "\u2018It\u2019s so funny\u2014to be asked that.\u2019\nThat hysterical laughter had not passed unheard.",
    "The door opened and Miss Carroll came in.",

    "She was a\ngentle creature I believe with a very sweet disposition.",
    "I\u2019ve always been sorry for her.",

    "Of course there was no one.\u2019\nChapter 14\nFive Questions\n\u2018Why did you ask Miss Carroll about the possibility of Lord Edgware\u2019s wanting to marry again\u2019 I\nasked with some curiosity as we were driving home.",
    "\u2018It just occurred to me that there was a possibility of such a thingmon ami .\u2019\n\u2018Why\u2019\n\u2018I have been searching in my mind for something to explain Lord Edgware\u2019s suddenvolte face regarding\nthe matter of divorce.",
    "There is something curious there my friend.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 I said thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018It is rather odd.\u2019\n\u2018You see Hastings Lord Edgware confirmed what Madame had told us.",
    "She had employed the lawyers\nof all kinds but he refused to budge an inch.",
    "No he would not agree to the divorce.",
    "And then all of a\nsudden he yields\u2019\n\u2018Or so he says\u2019 I reminded him.",
    "\u2018Very true Hastings.",
    "It is very just the observation you make there.So he says .",
    "We have no proof\nwhatever that that letter was written.Eh bien  on one partce Monsieur is lying.",
    "For some reason he tells\nus the fabrication the embroidery.",
    "Is it not so Why we do not know.",
    "But on the hypothesis that hedid\nwrite that letter there must have been areason for so doing.",
    "Now the reason that presents itself most\nnaturally to the imagination is that he has suddenly met someone whom he desires to marry.",
    "That explains\nperfectly his sudden change of face.",
    "And so naturally I make the inquiries.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Miss Carroll turned the idea down very decisively\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "Miss Carroll\u2026\u2019 said Poirot in a meditative voice.",
    "\u2018Now what are you driving at\u2019 I asked in exasperation.",
    "Poirot is an adept at suggesting doubts by the tone of his voice.",
    "\u2018What reason should she have for lying about it\u2019 I asked.",
    "\u2018Aucune\u2014aucune.\u2019\n\u2018But you see Hastings it is difficult to trust her evidence.\u2019\n\u2018You think she\u2019s lying But why She looks a most upright person.\u2019\n\u2018That is just it.",
    "Between the deliberate falsehood and the disinterested inaccuracy it is very hard to\ndistinguish sometimes.\u2019\n\u2018Whatdo you mean\u2019\n\u2018To deceive deliberately\u2014that is one thing.",
    "But to be so sure of your facts of your ideas and of their\nessential truth that the details do not matter\u2014that my friend is a special characteristic of particularly\nhonest persons.",
    "Already mark you she has told us one lie.",
    "She said she saw Jane Wilkinson\u2019s face\nwhen she could not possibly have done so.",
    "Now how did that come about Look at it this way.",
    "She\nlooks down and sees Jane Wilkinson in the hall.",
    "No doubt enters her head that itis Jane Wilkinson.",
    "She\nknows it is.",
    "She says she saw her face distinctly because\u2014being so sure of her facts\u2014exact details do\nnot matter It is pointed out to her that she could not have seen her face.",
    "Is that so Well what does it\nmatter if she saw her face or not\u2014itwas Jane Wilkinson.",
    "And so with any other question.",
    "Sheknows .",
    "And so she answers questions in the light of her knowledge not by reason of remembered facts.",

    "The uncertain witness who doesn\u2019t\nremember isn\u2019t sure will think a minute\u2014ah yes that\u2019s how it was\u2014is infinitely more to be depended\nupon\u2019\n\u2018Dear me Poirot\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018You upset all my preconceived ideas about witnesses.\u2019\n\u2018In reply to my question as to Lord Edgware\u2019s marrying again she ridicules the idea\u2014simply because it\nhas never occurred to her.",
    "She will not take the trouble to remember whether any infinitesimal signs may\nhave pointed that way.",
    "Therefore we are exactly where we were before.\u2019\n\u2018She certainly did not seem at all taken aback when you pointed out she could not have seen Jane\nWilkinson\u2019s face\u2019 I remarked thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018No.",
    "That is why I decided that she was one of those honestly inaccurate persons rather than a\ndeliberate liar.",
    "I can see no motive for deliberate lying unless\u2014true that is an idea\u2019\n\u2018What is\u2019 I asked eagerly.",
    "But Poirot shook his head.",
    "\u2018An idea suggested itself to me.",
    "But it is too impossible\u2014yes much too impossible.\u2019\n\n\fAnd he refused to say more.",
    "\u2018She seems very fond of the girl\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "She certainly was determined to assist at our interview.",
    "What was your impression of the\nHonourable Geraldine Marsh Hastings\u2019\n\u2018I was sorry for her\u2014deeply sorry for her.\u2019\n\u2018You have always the tender heart Hastings.",
    "Beauty in distress upsets you every time.\u2019\n\u2018Didn\u2019t you feel the same\u2019\nHe nodded gravely.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2014she has not had a happy life.",
    "That is written very clearly on her face.\u2019\n\u2018At any rate\u2019 I said warmly \u2018you realize how preposterous Jane Wilkinson\u2019s suggestion was\u2014that she\nshould have had anything to do with the crime I mean.\u2019\n\u2018Doubtless her alibi is satisfactory but Japp has not communicated it to me as yet.\u2019\n\u2018My dear Poirot\u2014do you mean to say that even after seeing her and talking to her you are still not\nsatisfied and want an alibi\u2019\n\u2018Eh bien my friend what is the result of seeing and talking to her We perceive that she has passed\nthrough great unhappiness she admits that she hated her father and is glad that he is dead and she is\ndeeply uneasy about what he may have said to us yesterday morning.",
    "And after that you say\u2014no alibi is\nnecessary\u2019\n\u2018Her mere frankness proves her innocence\u2019 I said warmly.",
    "\u2018Frankness is a characteristic of the family.",
    "The new Lord Edgware\u2014with what a gesture he laid his\ncards on the table.\u2019\n\u2018He did indeed\u2019 I said smiling at the remembrance.",
    "\u2018Rather an original method.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018He\u2014what do you say\u2014cut the ground before our feet.\u2019\n\u2018From under\u2019 I corrected.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2014it made us look rather foolish.\u2019\n\u2018What a curious idea.",
    "You may have looked foolish.",
    "I didn\u2019t feel foolish in the least and I do not think I\nlooked it.",
    "On the contrary my friend I put him out of countenance.\u2019\n\u2018Did you\u2019 I said doubtfully not remembering having seen signs of anything of the kind.",
    "\u2018Si si.",
    "I listen\u2014and listen.",
    "And at last I ask a question about something quite different and that you\nmay have noticed disconcerts our brave Monsieur very much.",
    "You do not observe Hastings.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018I thought his horror and astonishment at hearing of Carlotta Adams\u2019 death was genuine\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018I\nsuppose you will say it was a piece of clever acting.\u2019\n\u2018Impossible to tell.",
    "I agree itseemed genuine.\u2019\n\u2018Why do you think he flung all those facts at our head in that cynical way Just for amusement\u2019\n\u2018That is always possible.",
    "You English you have the most extraordinary notions of humour.",
    "But it may\nhave been policy.",
    "Facts that are concealed acquire a suspicious importance.",

    "He knows that the fact is bound to leak out.Eh bien  he will parade it.\u2019\n\u2018He is not so foolish as he looks.\u2019\n\u2018Oh he is not foolish at all.",
    "He has plenty of brains when he cares to use them.",
    "He sees exactly where\nhe stands and as I said he lays his cards on the table.",
    "You play the bridge Hastings.",
    "Tell me when does\none do that\u2019\n\u2018You play bridge yourself\u2019 I said laughing.",
    "\u2018You know well enough\u2014when all the rest of the tricks are\nyours and you want to save time and get on to a new hand.\u2019\n\u2018Yesmon ami  that is all very true.",
    "But occasionally there is another reason.",
    "I have remarked it once or\ntwice when playing withles dames .",
    "There is perhaps a little doubt.Eh bien la dame  she throws down\nthe cards says \u201cand all the rest are mine\u201d and gathers up the cards and cuts the new pack.",
    "And possibly\nthe other players agree\u2014especially if they are a little inexperienced.",
    "The thing is not obvious mark you.",
    "It requires to be followed out.",
    "Halfway through dealing the next hand one of the players thinks \u201cYes\nbut she would have to have taken over that fourth diamond in dummy whether she wanted it or not and\nthen she would have had to lead a little club and my nine would have made.\u201d\u2019\n\u2018So you think\u2019\n\u2018I think Hastings that too much bravado is a very interesting thing.",
    "And I also think that it is time we\ndined.Une petite omelette n\u2019est ce pas And after that about nine o\u2019clock I have one more visit I wish\nto make.\u2019\n\u2018Where is that\u2019\n\u2018We will dine first Hastings.",
    "And until we drink our coffee we will not discuss the case further.",
    "When\nengaged in eating the brain should be the servant of the stomach.\u2019\nPoirot was as good as his word.",
    "We went to a little restaurant in Soho where he was well known and\nthere we had a delicious omelette a sole a chicken and aBaba au Rhum of which Poirot was inordinately\nfond.",
    "Then as we sipped our coffee Poirot smiled affectionately across the table at me.",
    "\u2018My good friend\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I depend upon you more than you know.\u2019\n\n\fI was confused and delighted by these unexpected words.",
    "He had never said anything of the kind to me\nbefore.",
    "Sometimes secretly I had felt slightly hurt.",
    "He seemed almost to go out of his way to disparage\nmy mental powers.",
    "Although I did not think his own powers were flagging I did realize suddenly that perhaps he had come\nto depend on my aid more than he knew.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 he said dreamily.",
    "\u2018You may not always comprehend just how it is so\u2014but you do often and\noften point the way.\u2019\nI could hardly believe my ears.",
    "\u2018Really Poirot\u2019 I stammered.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m awfully glad I suppose I\u2019ve learnt a good deal from you one way or\nanother\u2014\u2019\nHe shook his head.",
    "\u2018Mais non ce n\u2019est pas \u00e7a.",
    "You have learnt nothing.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 I said rather taken aback.",
    "\u2018That is as it should be.",
    "No human being should learn from another.",
    "Each individual should develop his\nown powers to the uttermost not try to imitate those of someone else.",
    "I do not wish you to be a second\nand inferior Poirot.",
    "I wish you to be the supreme Hastings.",
    "And you are the supreme Hastings.",
    "In you\nHastings I find the normal mind almost perfectly illustrated.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not abnormal I hope\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018No no.",
    "You are beautifully and perfectly balanced.",
    "In you sanity is personified.",
    "Do you realize what\nthat means to me When the criminal sets out to do a crime his first effort is to deceive.",
    "Who does he\nseek to deceive The image in his mind is that of the normal man.",
    "There is probably no such thing\nactually\u2014it is a mathematical abstraction.",
    "But you come as near to realizing it as is possible.",
    "There are\nmoments when you have flashes of brilliance when you rise above the average moments I hope you will\npardon me when you descend to curious depths of obtuseness but take it all for all you are amazingly\nnormal.Eh bien  how does this profit me Simply in this way.",
    "As in a mirror I see reflected in your mind\nexactly what the criminal wishes me to believe.",
    "That is terrifically helpful and suggestive.\u2019\nI did not quite understand.",
    "It seemed to me that what Poirot was saying was hardly complimentary.",
    "However he quickly disabused me of that impression.",
    "\u2018I have expressed myself badly\u2019 he said quickly.",
    "\u2018You have an insight into the criminal mind which I\nmyself lack.",
    "You show me what the criminal wishes me to believe.",
    "It is a great gift.\u2019\n\u2018Insight\u2019 I said thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018Yes perhaps I have got insight.\u2019\nI looked across the table at him.",
    "He was smoking his tiny cigarettes and regarding me with great\nkindliness.",
    "\u2018Ce cherHastings\u2019 he murmured.",
    "\u2018I have indeed much affection for you.\u2019\n\n\fI was pleased but embarrassed and hastened to change the subject.",
    "\u2018Come\u2019 I said in a businesslike manner.",
    "\u2018Let us discuss the case.\u2019\n\u2018Eh bien.\u2019 Poirot threw his head back his eyes narrowed.",
    "He slowly puffed out smoke.",
    "\u2018Je me pose des questions\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 I said eagerly.",
    "\u2018You too doubtless\u2019\n\u2018Certainly\u2019 I said.",
    "And also leaning back and narrowing my own eyes I threw out\n\u2018Who killed Lord Edgware\u2019\nPoirot immediately sat up and shook his head vigorously.",
    "\u2018No no.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Is it a question that You are like someone who reads the detective story and who\nstarts guessing each of the characters in turn without rhyme or reason.",
    "Once I agree I had to do that\nmyself.",
    "It was a very exceptional case.",
    "I will tell you about it one of these days.",
    "It was a feather in my\ncap.",
    "But of what were we speaking\u2019\n\u2018Of the questions you were \u201cposing\u201d to yourself\u2019 I replied dryly.",
    "It was on the tip of my tongue to\nsuggest that my real use to Poirot was to provide him with a companion to whom he could boast but I\ncontrolled myself.",
    "If he wished to instruct then let him.",
    "\u2018Come on\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Let\u2019s hear them.\u2019\nThat was all that the vanity of the man wanted.",
    "He leaned back again and resumed his former attitude.",
    "\u2018The first question we have already discussed.Why did Lord Edgware change his mind on the subject of\ndivorce One or two ideas suggest themselves to me on that subject.",
    "One of them you know.",
    "\u2018The second question I ask myself isWhat happened to that letter To whose interest was it that Lord\nEdgware and his wife should continue to be tied together\n\u2018ThreeWhat was the meaning of the expression on his face that you saw when you looked back\nyesterday morning on leaving the library Have you any answer to that Hastings\u2019\nI shook my head.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t understand it.\u2019\n\u2018You are sure that you didn\u2019t imagine it Sometimes Hastings you have the imaginationun peu vif .\u2019\n\u2018No no.\u2019 I shook my head vigorously.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m quite sure I wasn\u2019t mistaken.\u2019\n\u2018Bien.",
    "Then it is a fact to be explained.",
    "My fourth question concerns those pincenez.",
    "Neither Jane\nWilkinson nor Carlotta Adams wore glasses.",
    "What then are the glasses doing in Carlotta Adams\u2019 bag\n\n\f\u2018And for my fifth question.Why did someone telephone to find out if Jane Wilkinson were at Chiswick\nand who was it\n\u2018Those my friend are the questions with which I am tormenting myself.",
    "If I could answer those I should\nfeel happier in my mind.",
    "If I could even evolve a theory that explained them satisfactorily myamour\npropre would not suffer so much.\u2019\n\u2018There are several other questions\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Such as\u2019\n\u2018Who incited Carlotta Adams to this hoax Where was she that evening before and after ten o\u2019clock\nWho is D who gave her the golden box\u2019\n\u2018Those questions are selfevident\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018There is no subtlety about them.",
    "They are simply things\nwe do not know.",
    "They are questions offact .",
    "We may get to know them any minute.",
    "My questionsmon\nami  are psychological.",
    "The little grey cells of the brain\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Poirot\u2019 I said desperately.",

    "I could not bear to hear it all over\nagain.",
    "\u2018You spoke of making a visit tonight\u2019\nPoirot looked at his watch.",
    "\u2018True\u2019 he said.",

    "\u2018Come\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018All is well.\u2019\n\u2018Where are we going\u2019 I asked.",
    "\u2018To the house of Sir Montagu Corner at Chiswick.",

    "It was\na big house standing back in its own grounds.",

    "His manner was affected to the last degree.",
    "\u2018Let me introduce you.",

    "\u2018Here one is in the oldworld\natmosphere of peace that\u2014alas\u2014we have put behind us in these jarring days.\u2019\nA sudden impish fancy flashed over me that if someone were really to offer Sir Montagu a million\npounds oldworld peace might go to the wall but I trod down such heretical sentiments.",

    "\u2018I expected this.\u2019\n\u2018Eh\u2019 The young man seemed taken aback.",
    "\u2018You expected this\u2019 he asked in a puzzled way.",
    "\u2018Mais oui.",
    "When you spoke of consulting your friend\u2014I could have predicted that all would have\narrived as it has done.\u2019\n\u2018You have a theory then\u2019\n\u2018A detective M. Martin always has a theory.",
    "It is expected of him.",
    "I do not call it a theory myself.",
    "I say\nthat I have a little idea.",
    "That is the first stage.\u2019\n\u2018And the second stage\u2019\n\u2018If the little idea turns out to be right\u2014then Iknow  It is quite simple you see.\u2019\n\u2018I wish you\u2019d tell me what your theory\u2014or your little idea\u2014is\u2019\nPoirot shook his head gently.",
    "\u2018That is another rule.",
    "The detective never tells.\u2019\n\u2018Can\u2019t you suggest it even\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "I will only say that I formed my theory as soon as you mentioned a gold tooth.\u2019\nBryan Martin stared at him.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m absolutely bewildered\u2019 he declared.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t make out what you are driving at.",
    "If you\u2019d just give\nme a hint.\u2019\nPoirot smiled and shook his head.",
    "\u2018Let us change the subject.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but first\u2014your fee\u2014you must let me.\u2019\nPoirot waved an imperious hand.",
    "\u2018Pas un sou I have done nothing to aid you.\u2019\n\u2018I took up your time\u2014\u2019\n\u2018When a case interests me I do not touch money.",
    "Your case interested me very much.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m glad\u2019 said the actor uneasily.",
    "He looked supremely unhappy.",
    "\u2018Come\u2019 said Poirot kindly.",
    "\u2018Let us talk of something else.\u2019\n\u2018Wasn\u2019t that the Scotland Yard man whom I met on the stairs\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Yes Inspector Japp.\u2019\n\u2018The light was so dim I wasn\u2019t sure.",
    "By the way he came round and asked me some questions about\nthat poor girl Carlotta Adams who died of an overdose of veronal.\u2019\n\u2018You knew her well\u2014Miss Adams\u2019\n\u2018Not very well.",
    "I knew her as a child in America.",
    "I came across her here once or twice but I never saw\nvery much of her.",
    "I was very sorry to hear of her death.\u2019\n\u2018You liked her\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "She was extraordinarily easy to talk to.\u2019\n\u2018A personality very sympathetic\u2014yes I found the same.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose they think it might be suicide I knew nothing that could help the inspector.",
    "Carlotta was\nalways very reserved about herself.\u2019\n\u2018I do not think it was suicide\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Far more likely to be an accident I agree.\u2019\nThere was a pause.",
    "Then Poirot said with a smile\n\u2018The affair of Lord Edgware\u2019s death becomes intriguing does it not\u2019\n\u2018Absolutely amazing.",
    "Do you know\u2014have they any idea\u2014who did it\u2014now that Jane is definitely out of\nit\u2019\n\u2018Mais oui\u2014they have a very strong suspicion.\u2019\nBryan Martin looked excited.",
    "\u2018Really Who\u2019\n\u2018The butler has disappeared.",
    "You comprehend\u2014flight is as good as a confession.\u2019\n\u2018The butler Really you surprise me.\u2019\n\u2018A singularly goodlooking man.Il vous ressemble un peu .\u2019 He bowed in a complimentary fashion.",
    "Of course I realized now why the butler\u2019s face had struck me as being faintly familiar when I first saw it.",
    "\u2018You flatter me\u2019 said Bryan Martin with a laugh.",
    "\u2018No no no.",
    "Do not all the young girls the servant girls the flappers the typists the girls of society do\nthey not all adore M. Bryan Martin Is there one who can resist you\u2019\n\n\f\u2018A lot I should think\u2019 said Martin.",
    "He got up abruptly.",
    "\u2018Well thank you very much M. Poirot.",
    "Let me apologize again for having troubled you.\u2019\nHe shook hands with us both.",
    "Suddenly I noticed he looked much older.",
    "The haggard look was more\napparent.",
    "I was devoured with curiosity and as soon as the door closed behind him I burst out with what I\nwanted to know.",
    "\u2018Poirot did you really expect him to come back and relinquish all idea of investigating those queer things\nthat happened to him in America\u2019\n\u2018You heard me say so Hastings.\u2019\n\u2018But then\u2014\u2019 I followed the thing out logically.",
    "\u2018Then you must know who this mysterious girl is that he had to consult\u2019\nHe smiled.",
    "\u2018I have a little idea my friend.",
    "As I told you it started from the mention of the gold tooth and if my little\nidea is correct I know who the girl is I know why she will not let M. Martin consult me.",
    "I know the truth\nof the whole affair.",
    "And so could you know it if you would only use the brains the good God has given\nyou.",
    "Sometimes I really am tempted to believe that by inadvertence He passed you by.\u2019\nChapter 18\nThe Other Man\nI do not propose to describe either the inquest on Lord Edgware or that on Carlotta Adams.",
    "In\nCarlotta\u2019s case the verdict was Death by Misadventure.",
    "In the case of Lord Edgware the inquest was\nadjourned after evidence of identification and the medical evidence had been given.",
    "As a result of the\nanalysis of the stomach the time of death was fixed as having occurred not less than an hour after the\ncompletion of dinner with possible extension to an hour after that.",
    "This put it as between ten and eleven\no\u2019clock with the probability in favour of the earlier time.",
    "None of the facts concerning Carlotta\u2019s impersonation of Jane Wilkinson were allowed to leak out.",
    "A\ndescription of the wanted butler was published in the press and the general impression seemed to be that\nthe butler was the man wanted.",
    "His story of Jane Wilkinson\u2019s visit was looked upon as an impudent\nfabrication.",
    "Nothing was said of the secretary\u2019s corroborating testimony.",
    "There were columns concerning\nthe murder in all the papers but little real information.",
    "Meanwhile Japp was actively at work I knew.",
    "It vexed me a little that Poirot adopted such an inert\nattitude.",
    "The suspicion that approaching old age had something to do with it flashed across me\u2014not for\nthe first time.",
    "He made excuses to me which did not ring very convincingly.",
    "\u2018At my time of life one saves oneself the trouble\u2019 he explained.",
    "\u2018But Poirot my dear fellow you mustn\u2019t think of yourself as old\u2019 I protested.",
    "I felt that he needed bracing.",
    "Treatment by suggestion\u2014that I know is the modern idea.",
    "\u2018You are as full of vigour as ever you were\u2019 I said earnestly.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re in the prime of life Poirot.",
    "At the\nheight of your powers.",
    "You could go out and solve this case magnificently if you only would.\u2019\nPoirot replied that he preferred to solve it sitting at home.",
    "\u2018But you can\u2019t do that Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018Not entirely it is true.\u2019\n\u2018What I mean is we are doing nothing Japp is doing everything.\u2019\n\u2018Which suits me admirably.\u2019\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t suit me at all.",
    "I want you to be doing things.\u2019\n\u2018So I am.\u2019\n\u2018What are you doing\u2019\n\u2018Waiting.\u2019\n\u2018Waiting for what\u2019\n\u2018Pour que mon chien de chasse me rapporte le gibier\u2019 replied Poirot with a twinkle.",

    "Why keep a dog and bark yourself Japp brings us here the result of the\nphysical energy you admire so much.",
    "He has various means at his disposal which I have not.",
    "He will have\nnews for us very soon I do not doubt.\u2019\nBy dint of persistent inquiry it was true that Japp was slowly getting together material.",
    "He had drawn a\nblank in Paris but a couple of days later he came in looking pleased with himself.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s slow work\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018But we\u2019re getting somewhere at last.\u2019\n\u2018I congratulate you my friend.",
    "What has happened\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve discovered that a fairhaired lady deposited an attach\u00e9case in the cloakroom at Euston at nine\no\u2019clock that night.",
    "They\u2019ve been shown Miss Adams\u2019 case and identify it positively.",
    "It\u2019s of American\nmake and so just a little different.\u2019\n\u2018Ah Euston.",
    "Yes the nearest of the big stations to Regent Gate.",
    "She went there doubtless made herself\nup in the lavatory and then left the case.",
    "When was it taken out again\u2019\n\u2018At halfpast ten.",
    "The clerk says by the same lady.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018And I\u2019ve come on something else too.",
    "I\u2019ve reason to believe that Carlotta Adams was in Lyons Corner\nHouse in the Strand at eleven o\u2019clock.\u2019\n\u2018Ah c\u2019est tr\u00eas bien \u00e7aHow did you come across that\u2019\n\u2018Well really more or less by chance.",
    "You see there\u2019s been a mention in the papers of the little gold box\nwith the ruby initials.",
    "Some reporter wrote it up\u2014he was doing an article on the prevalence of\ndopetaking among young actresses.",
    "Sunday paper romantic stuff.",
    "The fatal little gold box with its deadly\ncontents\u2014pathetic figure of a young girl with all the world before her And just a wonder expressed as to\nwhere she passed her last evening and how she felt and so on and so on.",
    "\u2018Well it seems a waitress at the Corner House read this and she remembered that a lady she had served\nthat evening had had such a box in her hand.",
    "She remembered the C.A.",
    "on it.",
    "And she got excited and\nbegan talking to all her friends\u2014perhaps a paper would give her something\n\u2018A young newspaper man soon got on to it and there\u2019s going to be a good sobstuff article in tonight\u2019s\nEvening Shriek .",

    "It got passed on to me while their\nparticular bright young man tried to get some news out of me about something else.",
    "So I rushed along to\nthe Corner House straight away\u2014\u2019\nYes that was the way things ought to be done.",
    "I felt a pang of pity for Poirot.",
    "Here was Japp getting all\nthis news at first hand\u2014quite possibly missing valuable details and here was Poirot placidly content with\nstale news.",

    "Had got on one of the new hats.",
    "I wish women looked at faces\na bit more and hats a bit less.\u2019\n\u2018The face of Miss Adams is not an easy one to observe\u2019 said Poirot.",

    "Overlook a private letter.\u2019\n\u2018You say the imbecilities Hastings.",
    "Absurd to say I \u201ccannot do\u201d a thing which I have just done\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not\u2014not playing the game.\u2019\n\u2018I do not play games.",
    "You know that.",
    "Murder is not a game.",
    "It is serious.",
    "And anyway Hastings you\nshould not use that phrase\u2014playing the game.",
    "It is not said any more.",
    "I have discovered that.",
    "It is dead.",
    "Young people laugh when they hear it.Mais oui  young beautiful girls will laugh at you if you say \u201cplaying\nthe game\u201d and \u201cnot cricket\u201d.\u2019\nI was silent.",
    "I could not bear this thing that Poirot had done so lightheartedly.",
    "\u2018It was so unnecessary\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018If you had only told him that you had gone to Lord Edgware at Jane\nWilkinson\u2019s request then he would have treated you very differently.\u2019\n\u2018Ah but I couldn\u2019t do that.",
    "Jane Wilkinson was my client.",
    "I cannot speak of my client\u2019s affairs to\nanother.",
    "I undertake a mission in confidence.",
    "To speak of it would not be honourable.\u2019\n\u2018Honourable\u2019\n\u2018Precisely.\u2019\n\u2018But she\u2019s going to marry him\u2019\n\u2018That does not mean that she has no secrets from him.",
    "Your ideas about marriage are very\noldfashioned.",
    "No what you suggest I couldn\u2019t possibly have done.",
    "I have my honour as a detective to\nthink of.",
    "The honour it is a very serious thing.\u2019\n\u2018Well I suppose it takes all kinds of honour to make a world.\u2019\nChapter 19\n\n\fA Great Lady\nThe visit that we received on the following morning was to my mind one of the most surprising things\nabout the whole affair.",
    "I was in my sitting room when Poirot slipped in with his eyes shining.",
    "\u2018Mon ami we have a visitor.\u2019\n\u2018Who is it\u2019\n\u2018The Dowager Duchess of Merton.\u2019\n\u2018How extraordinary What does she want\u2019\n\u2018If you accompany me downstairsmon ami  you will know.\u2019\nI hastened to comply.",
    "We entered the room together.",
    "The Duchess was a small woman with a highbridged nose and autocratic eyes.",
    "Although she was short\none would not have dared to call her dumpy.",
    "Dressed though she was in unfashionable black she was\nyet every inch agrande dame .",
    "She also impressed me as having an almost ruthless personality.",
    "Where\nher son was negative she was positive.",
    "Her willpower was terrific.",
    "I could almost feel waves of force\nemanating from her.",
    "No wonder this woman had always dominated all those with whom she came in\ncontact\nShe put up a lorgnette and studied first me and then my companion.",
    "Then she spoke to him.",
    "Her voice\nwas clear and compelling a voice accustomed to command and to be obeyed.",
    "\u2018You are M. Hercule Poirot\u2019\nMy friend bowed.",
    "\u2018At your service Madame la Duchesse.\u2019\nShe looked at me.",
    "\u2018This is my friend Captain Hastings.",
    "He assists me in my cases.\u2019\nHer eyes looked momentarily doubtful.",
    "Then she bent her head in acquiescence.",
    "She took the chair that Poirot offered.",
    "\u2018I have come to consult you on a very delicate matter M. Poirot and I must ask that what I tell you shall\nbe understood to be entirely confidential.\u2019\n\u2018That goes without saying Madame.\u2019\n\u2018It was Lady Yardly who told me about you.",
    "From the way in which she spoke of you and the gratitude\nshe expressed I felt that you were the only person likely to help me.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Rest assured I will do my best Madame.\u2019\nStill she hesitated.",
    "Then at last with an effort she came to the point came to it with a simplicity that\nreminded me in an odd way of Jane Wilkinson on that memorable night at the Savoy.",
    "\u2018M.",
    "Poirot I want you to ensure that my son does not marry the actress Jane Wilkinson.\u2019\nIf Poirot felt astonishment he refrained from showing it.",
    "He regarded her thoughtfully and took his time\nabout replying.",
    "\u2018Can you be a little more definite Madame as to what you want me to do\u2019\n\u2018That is not easy.",
    "I feel that such a marriage would be a great disaster.",
    "It would ruin my son\u2019s life.\u2019\n\u2018Do you think so Madame\u2019\n\u2018I am sure of it.",
    "My son has very high ideals.",
    "He knows really very little of the world.",
    "He has never\ncared for the young girls of his own class.",
    "They have struck him as emptyheaded and frivolous.",
    "But as\nregards this woman\u2014well she is very beautiful I admit that.",
    "And she has the power of enslaving men.",
    "She has bewitched my son.",
    "I have hoped that the infatuation would run its course.",
    "Mercifully she was not\nfree.",
    "But now that her husband is dead\u2014\u2019\nShe broke off.",
    "\u2018They intend to be married in a few months\u2019 time.",
    "The whole happiness of my son\u2019s life is at stake.\u2019 She\nspoke more peremptorily.",
    "\u2018It must be stopped M. Poirot.\u2019\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018I do not say that you are not right Madame.",
    "I agree that the marriage is not a suitable one.",
    "But what\ncan one do\u2019\n\u2018It is for you to do something.\u2019\nPoirot slowly shook his head.",
    "\u2018Yes yes you must help me.\u2019\n\u2018I doubt if anything would avail Madame.",
    "Your son I should say would refuse to listen to anything\nagainst the lady And also I do not think there is very much against her to say I doubt if there are any\ndiscreditable incidents to be raked up in her past.",
    "She has been\u2014shall we say\u2014careful\u2019\n\u2018I know\u2019 said the Duchess grimly.",
    "\u2018Ah So you have already made the inquiries in that direction.\u2019\nShe flushed a little under his keen glance.",
    "\u2018There is nothing I would not do M. Poirot to save my son from this marriage.\u2019 She reiterated that\nword emphatically \u2018Nothing\u2019\n\n\fShe paused then went on\n\u2018Money is nothing in this matter.",
    "Name any fee you like.",
    "But the marriage must be stopped.",
    "You are the\nman to do it.\u2019\nPoirot slowly shook his head.",
    "\u2018It is not a question of money.",
    "I can do nothing\u2014for a reason which I will explain to you presently.",
    "But\nalso I may say I do not see there is anything to be done.",
    "I cannot give you help Madame la Duchesse.",
    "Will you think me impertinent if I give you advice\u2019\n\u2018What advice\u2019\n\u2018Do not antagonize your sonHe is of an age to choose for himself.",
    "Because his choice is not your\nchoice do not assume that you must be right.",
    "If it is a misfortune\u2014then accept misfortune.",
    "Be at hand to\naid him when he needs aid.",
    "But do not turn him against you.\u2019\n\u2018You hardly understand.\u2019\nShe rose to her feet.",
    "Her lips were trembling.",
    "\u2018But yes Madame la Duchesse I understand very well.",
    "I comprehend the mother\u2019s heart.",
    "No one\ncomprehends it better than I Hercule Poirot.",
    "And I say to you with authority\u2014be patient.",
    "Be patient and\ncalm and disguise your feelings.",
    "There is yet a chance that the matter may break itself.",
    "Opposition will\nmerely increase your son\u2019s obstinacy.\u2019\n\u2018Goodbye M. Poirot\u2019 she said coldly.",
    "\u2018I am disappointed.\u2019\n\u2018I regret infinitely Madame that I cannot be of service to you.",
    "I am in a difficult position.",
    "Lady\nEdgware you see has already done me the honour to consult me herself.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I see.\u2019 Her voice cut like a knife.",
    "\u2018You are in the opposite camp.",
    "That explains no doubt why\nLady Edgware has not yet been arrested for her husband\u2019s murder.\u2019\n\u2018Comment Madame la Duchesse\u2019\n\u2018I think you heard what I said.",
    "Why is she not arrested She was there that evening.",
    "She was seen to\nenter the house\u2014to enter his study.",
    "No one else went near him and he was found dead And yet she is\nnot arrested Our police force must be corrupt through and through.\u2019\nWith shaking hands she arranged the scarf round her neck then with the slightest of bows she swept out\nof the room.",
    "\u2018Whew\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018What a tartar I admire her though don\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018Because she wishes to arrange the universe to her manner of thinking\u2019\n\u2018Well she\u2019s only got her son\u2019s welfare at heart.\u2019\nPoirot nodded his head.",
    "\u2018That is true enough and yet Hastings will it really be such a bad thing for M.le Duc to marry Jane\nWilkinson\u2019\n\u2018Why you don\u2019t think she is really in love with him\u2019\n\u2018Probably not.",
    "Almost certainly not.",
    "But she is very much in love with his position.",
    "She will play her part\ncarefully.",
    "She is an extremely beautiful woman and very ambitious.",
    "It is not such a catastrophe.",
    "The Duke\nmight very easily have married a young girl of his own class who would have accepted him for the same\nreasons\u2014but no one would have made the song and the dance about that.\u2019\n\u2018That is quite true but\u2014\u2019\n\u2018And suppose he marries a girl who loves him passionately is there such a great advantage in that\nOften I have observed that it is a great misfortune for a man to have a wife who loves him.",
    "She creates\nthe scenes of jealousy she makes him look ridiculous she insists on having all his time and attention.",
    "Ah\nnon  it is not the bed of roses.\u2019\n\u2018Poirot\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re an incurable old cynic.\u2019\n\u2018Mais non mais non I only make the reflections.",
    "See you really I am on the side of the good mamma.\u2019\nI could not refrain from laughing at hearing the haughty Duchess described in this way.",
    "Poirot remained quite serious.",
    "\u2018You should not laugh.",
    "It is of great importance\u2014all this.",
    "I must reflect.",
    "I must reflect a great deal.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t see what you can do in the matter\u2019 I said.",
    "Poirot paid no attention.",
    "\u2018You observed Hastings how wellinformed the Duchess was And how vindictive.",
    "She knew all the\nevidence there was against Jane Wilkinson.\u2019\n\u2018The case for the prosecution but not the case for the defence\u2019 I said smiling.",
    "\u2018How did she come to know of it\u2019\n\u2018Jane told the Duke.",
    "The Duke told her\u2019 I suggested.",
    "\u2018Yes that is possible.",
    "Yet I have\u2014\u2019\nThe telephone rang sharply.",
    "I answered it.",
    "My part consisted of saying \u2018Yes\u2019 at varying intervals.",
    "Finally I put down the receiver and turned\nexcitedly to Poirot.",
    "\u2018That was Japp.",
    "Firstly you\u2019re \u201cthe goods\u201d as usual.",
    "Secondly he\u2019s had a cable from America.",
    "Thirdly\nhe\u2019s got the taxidriver.",
    "Fourthly would you like to come round and hear what the taxidriver says.",
    "Fifthly you\u2019re \u201cthe goods\u201d again and all along he\u2019s been convinced that you\u2019d hit the nail on the head\n\n\fwhen you suggested that there was some man behind all this I omitted to tell him that we\u2019d just had a\nvisitor here who says the police force is corrupt.\u2019\n\u2018So Japp is convinced at last\u2019 murmured Poirot.",
    "\u2018Curious that the ManintheBackground theory\nshould be proved just at the moment when I was inclining to another possible theory.\u2019\n\u2018What theory\u2019\n\u2018The theory that the motive for the murder might have nothing to do with Lord Edgware himself.",
    "Imagine\nsomeone who hated Jane Wilkinson hated her so much that they would have even had her hanged for\nmurder.C\u2019est une id\u00e9e \u00e7a \u2019\nHe sighed\u2014then rousing himself\n\u2018Come Hastings let us hear what Japp has to say.\u2019\nChapter 20\nThe TaxiDriver\nWe found Japp interrogating an old man with a ragged moustache and spectacles.",
    "He had a hoarse\nselfpitying voice.",
    "\u2018Ah there you are\u2019 said Japp.",
    "\u2018Well things are all plain sailing I think.",
    "This man\u2014his name\u2019s\nJobson\u2014picked up two people in Long Acre on the night of June 29th.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s right\u2019 assented Jobson hoarsely.",
    "\u2018Lovely night it were.",
    "Moon and all.",
    "The young lady and\ngentleman were by the tube station and hailed me.\u2019\n\u2018They were in evening dress\u2019\n\u2018Yes gent in white waistcoat and the young lady all in white with birds embroidered on it.",
    "Come out of\nthe Royal Opera I guess.\u2019\n\u2018What time was this\u2019\n\u2018Some time afore eleven.\u2019\n\u2018Well what next\u2019\n\u2018Told me to go to Regent Gate\u2014they\u2019d tell me which house when they got there.",
    "And told me to be\nquick too.",
    "People always says that.",
    "As though you wanted to loiter.",
    "Sooner you get there and get\nanother fare the better for you.",
    "You never think of that.",
    "And mind you if there\u2019s an accident you\u2019ll get\nthe blame for dangerous driving\u2019\n\u2018Cut it out\u2019 said Japp impatiently.",
    "\u2018There wasn\u2019t an accident this time was there\u2019\n\u2018Nno\u2019 agreed the man as though unwilling to abandon his claim to such an occurrence.",
    "\u2018No as a\nmatter of fact there weren\u2019t.",
    "Well I got to Regent Gate\u2014not above seven minutes it didn\u2019t take me and\nthere the gentleman rapped on the glass and I stopped.",
    "About at No.",
    "8 that were.",
    "Well the gentleman\nand lady got out.",
    "The gentleman stopped where he was and told me to do the same.",
    "The lady crossed\n\n\fthe road and began walking back along the houses the other side.",
    "The gentleman stayed by the\ncab\u2014standing on the sidewalk with his back to me looking after her.",
    "Had his hands in his pockets.",
    "It\nwas about five minutes when I heard him say something\u2014kind of exclamation under his breath and then\noff he goes too.",
    "I looks after him because I wasn\u2019t going to be bilked.",
    "It\u2019s been done afore to me so I\nkept my eye on him.",
    "He went up the steps of one of the houses on the other side and went in.\u2019\n\u2018Did he push the door open\u2019\n\u2018No he had a latchkey.\u2019\n\u2018What number was the house\u2019\n\u2018It would be 17 or 19 I fancy.",
    "Well it seemed odd to me my being told to stay where I was.",
    "So I kept\nwatching.",
    "About five minutes later him and the young lady came out together.",
    "They got back into the cab\nand told me to drive back to Covent Garden Opera House.",
    "They stopped me just before I got there and\npaid me.",
    "Paid me handsome I will say.",
    "Though I expect I\u2019ve got into trouble over it\u2014seems there\u2019s\nnothing but trouble.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re all right\u2019 said Japp.",
    "\u2018Just run your eye over these will you and tell me if the young lady is\namong them.\u2019\nThere were half a dozen photographs all fairly alike as to type.",
    "I looked with some interest over his\nshoulder.",
    "\u2018That were her\u2019 said Jobson.",
    "He pointed a decisive finger at one of Geraldine Marsh in evening dress.",
    "\u2018Sure\u2019\n\u2018Quite sure.",
    "Pale she was and dark.\u2019\n\u2018Now the man.\u2019\nAnother sheaf of photographs was handed to him.",
    "He looked at them attentively and then shook his head.",
    "\u2018Well I couldn\u2019t say\u2014not for sure.",
    "Either of these two might be him.\u2019\nThe photographs included one of Ronald Marsh but Jobson had not selected it.",
    "Instead he indicated\ntwo other men not unlike Marsh in type.",
    "Jobson then departed and Japp flung the photographs on the table.",
    "\u2018Good enough.",
    "Wish I could have got a clearer identification of his lordship.",
    "Of course it\u2019s an old\nphotograph taken seven or eight years ago.",
    "The only one I could get hold of.",
    "Yes I\u2019d like a clearer\nidentification although the case is clear enough.",
    "Bang go a couple of alibis.",
    "Clever of you to think of it\nM. Poirot.\u2019\nPoirot looked modest.",
    "\u2018When I found that she and her cousin were both at the opera it seemed to me possible that they might\n\n\fhave been together during one of the intervals.",
    "Naturally the parties they were with would assume that\nthey had not left the Opera House.",
    "But a halfhour interval gives plenty of time to get to Regent Gate and\nback.",
    "The moment the new Lord Edgware laid such stress upon his alibi I was sure something was\nwrong with it.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re a nice suspicious sort of fellow aren\u2019t you\u2019 said Japp affectionately.",
    "\u2018Well you\u2019re about right.",
    "Can\u2019t be too suspicious in a world like this.",
    "His lordship is our man all right.",
    "Look at this.\u2019\nHe produced a paper.",
    "\u2018Cable from New York.",
    "They got in touch with Miss Lucie Adams.",
    "The letter was in the mail delivered\nto her this morning.",
    "She was not willing to give up the original unless absolutely necessary but she\nwillingly allowed the officer to take a copy of it and cable it to us.",
    "Here it is and it\u2019s as damning as you\ncould hope for.\u2019\nPoirot took the cable with great interest.",
    "I read it over his shoulder.",
    "Following is text to Lucie Adams dated June 29th 8 Rosedew Mansions London S.W.3.",
    "Begins\nDearest little Sister I\u2019m sorry I wrote such a scrappy bit last week but things were rather busy and there\nwas a lot to see to.",
    "Well darling it\u2019s been ever such a success Notices splendid box office good and\neverybody most kind.",
    "I\u2019ve got some real good friends over here and next year I\u2019m thinking of taking a\ntheatre for two months.",
    "The Russian dancer sketch went very well and the American woman in Paris too\nbut the Scenes at a Foreign Hotel are still the favourites I think.",
    "I\u2019m so excited that I hardly know what\nI\u2019m writing and you\u2019ll see why in a minute but first I must tell you what people have said.",
    "Mr\nHergsheimer was ever so kind and he\u2019s going to ask me to lunch to meet Sir Montagu Corner who\nmight do great things for me.",
    "The other night I met Jane Wilkinson and she was ever so sweet about my\nshow and my take off of her which brings me round to what I am going to tell you.",
    "I don\u2019t really like her\nvery much because I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about her lately from someone I know and she\u2019s behaved\ncruelly I think and in a very underhand way\u2014but I won\u2019t go into that now.",
    "You know that she really is\nLady Edgware I\u2019ve heard a lot about him too lately and he\u2019s no beauty I can tell you.",
    "He treated his\nnephew the Captain Marsh I have mentioned to you in the most shameful way\u2014literally turned him out\nof the house and discontinued his allowance.",
    "He told me all about it and I felt awfully sorry for him.",
    "He\nenjoyed my show very much he said.",
    "\u2018I believe it would take in Lord Edgware himself.",
    "Look here will\nyou take something on for a bet\u2019 I laughed and said \u2018How much\u2019 Lucie darling the answer fairly took\nmy breath away.",
    "Ten thousand dollars.",
    "Ten thousand dollars think of it\u2014just to help someone win a silly\nbet.",
    "\u2018Why\u2019 I said \u2018I\u2019d play a joke on the King in Buckingham Palace and risk l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 for that.\u2019\nWell then we laid our heads together and got down to details.",
    "I\u2019ll tell you all about it next week\u2014whether I\u2019m spotted or not.",
    "But anyway Lucie darling whether I\nsucceed or fail I\u2019m to have the ten thousand dollars.",
    "Oh Lucie little sister what that\u2019s going to mean to\nus.",
    "No time for more\u2014just going off to do my \u2018hoax\u2019.",
    "Lots and lots and lots of love little sister mine.",
    "Yours\nCarlotta.",
    "Poirot laid down the letter.",
    "It had touched him I could see.",
    "Japp however reacted in quite a different way.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ve got him\u2019 said Japp exultantly.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "His voice sounded strangely flat.",
    "Japp looked at him curiously.",
    "\u2018What is it M. Poirot\u2019\n\u2018Nothing\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018It is not somehow just as I thought.",
    "That is all.\u2019\nHe looked acutely unhappy.",
    "\u2018But still it must be so\u2019 he said as though to himself.",
    "\u2018Yes it must be so.\u2019\n\u2018Of course it is so.",
    "Why you\u2019ve said so all along\u2019\n\u2018No no.",
    "You misunderstand me.\u2019\n\u2018Didn\u2019t you say there was someone back of all this who got the girl into doing it innocently\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes.\u2019\n\u2018Well what more do you want\u2019\nPoirot sighed and said nothing.",
    "\u2018You are an odd sort of cove.",
    "Nothing ever satisfies you.",
    "I say it was a piece of luck the girl wrote this\nletter.\u2019\nPoirot agreed with more vigour than he had yet shown.",
    "\u2018Mais oui that is what the murderer did not expect.",
    "When Miss Adams accepted that ten thousand\ndollars she signed her death warrant.",
    "The murderer thought he had taken all precautions\u2014and yet in\nsheer innocence she outwitted him.",
    "The dead speak.",

    "I fancy he\u2019d been meditating something\nof the kind\u2014that\u2019s why he had the key with him.",
    "I don\u2019t believe that story of suddenly coming across it.",
    "Well as he talks to his cousin he sees that by involving her he gains additional security for himself.",
    "He\nplays on her feelings hints at the pearls she plays up and off they go.",
    "As soon as she\u2019s in the house he\nfollows her in and goes along to the library.",
    "Maybe his lordship has dozed off in his chair.",
    "Anyway in\ntwo seconds he\u2019s done the trick and he\u2019s out again.",
    "I don\u2019t fancy he meant the girl to catch him in the\nhouse.",
    "He counted on being found pacing up and down near the taxi.",
    "And I don\u2019t think the taximan was\nmeant to see him go in.",
    "The impression was to be that he was walking up and down smoking whilst he\nwaited for the girl.",
    "The taxi was facing the opposite direction remember.",
    "\u2018Of course the next morning he has to pledge the pearls.",
    "He must still seem to be in need of the money.",
    "Then when he hears of the crime he frightens the girl into concealing their visit to the house.",
    "They will\nsay that they spent that interval together at the Opera House.\u2019\n\u2018Then why did they not do so\u2019 asked Poirot sharply.",
    "Japp shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018Changed his mind.",
    "Or judged that she wouldn\u2019t be able to go through with it.",
    "She\u2019s a nervous type.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Poirot meditatively.",
    "\u2018She is a nervous type.\u2019\nAfter a minute or two he said\n\u2018It does not strike you that it would have been easier and simpler for Captain Marsh to have left the\nopera during the interval by himself.",
    "To have gone in quietly with his key killed his uncle and returned to\nthe opera\u2014instead of having a taxi outside and a nervous girl coming down the stairs any minute who\nmight lose her head and give him away.\u2019\nJapp grinned.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s what you and I would have done.",
    "But then we\u2019re a shade brighter than Captain Ronald Marsh.\u2019\n\u2018I am not so sure.",
    "He strikes me as intelligent.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018But not so intelligent as M. Hercule Poirot Come now I\u2019m sure of that\u2019 Japp laughed.",
    "Poirot looked at him coldly.",
    "\u2018If he isn\u2019t guilty why did he persuade the Adams girl to take on that stunt\u2019 went on Japp.",
    "\u2018There can\nbe only one reason for that stunt\u2014to protect the real criminal.\u2019\n\u2018There I am of accord with you absolutely.\u2019\n\u2018Well I\u2019m glad we agree about something.\u2019\n\u2018It might be he who actually spoke to Miss Adams\u2019 mused Poirot.",
    "\u2018Whilst really\u2014no that is an\nimbecility.\u2019\nThen looking suddenly at Japp he rapped out a quick question.",
    "\u2018What is your theory as to her death\u2019\nJapp cleared his throat.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m inclined to believe\u2014accident.",
    "A convenient accident I admit.",
    "I can\u2019t see that he could have had\nanything to do with it.",
    "His alibi is straight enough after the opera.",
    "He was at Sobranis with the\nDortheimers till after one o\u2019clock.",
    "Long before that she was in bed and asleep.",
    "No I think that was an\ninstance of the infernal luck criminals sometimes have.",
    "Otherwise if that accident hadn\u2019t happened I\nthink he had his plans for dealing with her.",
    "First he\u2019d put the fear of the Lord into her\u2014tell her she\u2019d be\narrested for murder if she confessed the truth.",
    "And then he\u2019d square her with a fresh lot of money.\u2019\n\u2018Does it strike you\u2014\u2019 Poirot stared straight in front of him.",
    "\u2018Does it strike you that Miss Adams would\nlet another woman be hanged when she herself held evidence that would acquit her\u2019\n\u2018Jane Wilkinson wouldn\u2019t have been hanged.",
    "The Montagu Corner party evidence was too strong for\nthat.\u2019\n\u2018But the murderer did not know that.",
    "He would have had to count on Jane Wilkinson being hanged and\nCarlotta Adams keeping silence.\u2019\n\u2018You love talking don\u2019t you M. Poirot And you\u2019re positively convinced now that Ronald Marsh is a\nwhiteheaded boy who can do no wrong.",
    "Do you believe that story of his about seeing a man sneak\nsurreptitiously into the house\u2019\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018Do you know who he says he thought it was\u2019\n\u2018I could guess perhaps.\u2019\n\u2018He says he thought it was the film star Bryan Martin.",
    "What do you think of that A man who\u2019d never\neven met Lord Edgware.\u2019\n\u2018Then it would certainly be curious if one saw such a man entering that house with a key.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Chah\u2019 said Japp.",
    "A rich noise expressive of contempt.",
    "\u2018And now I suppose it will surprise you to hear\nthat Mr Bryan Martin wasn\u2019t in London that night.",
    "He took a young lady to dine down at Molesey.",
    "They\ndidn\u2019t get back to London till midnight.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said Poirot mildly.",
    "\u2018No I am not surprised.",
    "Was the young lady also a member of the profession\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "Girl who keeps a hat shop.",
    "As a matter of fact it was Miss Adams\u2019 friend Miss Driver.",
    "I think\nyou\u2019ll agree her testimony is past suspicion.\u2019\n\u2018I am not disputing it my friend.\u2019\n\u2018In fact you\u2019re done down and you know it old boy\u2019 said Japp laughing.",
    "\u2018Cock and bull story\ntrumped up on the moment that\u2019s what it was.",
    "Nobody entered No.",
    "17\u2026and nobody entered either of\nthe houses either side\u2014so what does that show That his lordship\u2019s a liar.\u2019\nPoirot shook his head sadly.",
    "Japp rose to his feet\u2014his spirits restored.",
    "\u2018Come now we\u2019re right you know.\u2019\n\u2018Who was D. Paris November\u2019\nJapp shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018Ancient history I imagine.",
    "Can\u2019t a girl have a souvenir six months ago without its having something to\ndo with this crime We must have a sense of proportion.\u2019\n\u2018Six months ago\u2019 murmured Poirot a sudden light in his eyes.",
    "\u2018Dieu que je suis b\u00eate\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s he saying\u2019 inquired Japp of me.",
    "\u2018Listen.\u2019 Poirot rose and tapped Japp on the chest.",
    "\u2018Why does Miss Adams\u2019 maid not recognize that box Why does Miss Driver not recognize it\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean\u2019\n\u2018Because the box wasnew  It had only just been given to her.",
    "Paris November\u2014that is all very\nwell\u2014doubtless that is the date of which the box is to be asouvenir .",
    "But it was given to hernow  notthen\n.",
    "It has just been bought Only just been bought Investigate that I implore you my good Japp.",
    "It is a\nchance decidedly a chance.",
    "It was bought not here but abroad.",
    "Probably Paris.",
    "If it had been bought\nhere some jeweller would have come forward.",
    "It has been photographed and described in the papers.",
    "Yes yes Paris.",
    "Possibly some other foreign town but I think Paris.",
    "Find out I implore you.",
    "Make the\ninquiries.",
    "I want\u2014I so badly want\u2014to know who is this mysterious D.\u2019\n\u2018It will do no harm\u2019 said Japp goodnaturedly.",
    "\u2018Can\u2019t say I\u2019m very excited about it myself.",
    "But I\u2019ll do\nwhat I can.",
    "The more we know the better.\u2019\nNodding cheerfully to us he departed.",
    "Chapter 23\nThe Letter\n\u2018And now\u2019 said Poirot \u2018we will go out to lunch.\u2019\nHe put his hand through my arm.",
    "He was smiling at me.",
    "\u2018I have hope\u2019 he explained.",
    "I was glad to see him restored to his old self though I was none the less convinced myself of young\nRonald\u2019s guilt.",
    "I fancied that Poirot himself had perhaps come round to this view convinced by Japp\u2019s\narguments.",
    "The search for the purchaser of the box was perhaps a last sally to save his face.",
    "We went amicably to lunch together.",
    "Somewhat to my amusement at a table the other side of the room I saw Bryan Martin and Jenny Driver\nlunching together.",
    "Remembering what Japp had said I suspected a possible romance.",
    "They saw us and Jenny waved a hand.",
    "When we were sipping coffee Jenny left her escort and came over to our table.",
    "She looked as vivid and\ndynamic as ever.",
    "\u2018May I sit and talk to you a minute M. Poirot\u2019\n\u2018Assuredly Mademoiselle.",
    "I am charmed to see you.",
    "Will not M. Martin join us also\u2019\n\u2018I told him not to.",
    "You see I wanted to talk to you about Carlotta.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018You wanted to get a line on to some man friend of hers.",
    "Isn\u2019t that so\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes.\u2019\n\u2018Well I\u2019ve been thinking and thinking.",
    "Sometimes you can\u2019t get at things straight away.",
    "To get them\nclear you\u2019ve got to think back\u2014remember a lot of little words and phrases that perhaps you didn\u2019t pay\nattention to at the time.",
    "Well that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing.",
    "Thinking and thinking\u2014and remembering just\nwhat she said.",
    "And I\u2019ve come to a certain conclusion.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018I think the man that she cared about\u2014or was beginning to care about\u2014was Ronald Marsh\u2014you\nknow the one who has just succeeded to the title.\u2019\n\u2018What makes you think it was he Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018Well for one thing Carlotta was speaking in a general sort of way one day.",
    "About a man having hard\nluck and how it might affect character.",
    "That a man might be a decent sort really and yet go down the hill.",
    "More sinned against then sinning\u2014you know the idea.",
    "The first thing a woman kids herself with when\nshe\u2019s getting soft about a man.",
    "I\u2019ve heard the old wheeze so often Carlotta had plenty of sense yet here\nshe was coming out with this stuff just like a complete ass who knew nothing of life.",
    "\u201cHello\u201d I said to\nmyself.",
    "\u201cSomething\u2019s up.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention a name\u2014it was all general.",
    "But almost immediately after\nthat she began to speak of Ronald Marsh and that she thought he\u2019d been badly treated.",
    "She was very\nimpersonal and offhand about it.",
    "I didn\u2019t connect the two things at the time.",
    "But now\u2014I wonder.",
    "It\nseems to me that it was Ronald she meant.",
    "What do you think M. Poirot\u2019\nHer face looked earnestly up into his.",
    "\u2018I think Mademoiselle that you have perhaps given me some very valuable information.\u2019\n\u2018Good.\u2019 Jenny clapped her hands.",
    "Poirot looked kindly at her.",
    "\u2018Perhaps you have not heard\u2014the gentleman of whom you speak Ronald Marsh\u2014Lord\nEdgware\u2014has just been arrested.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 Her mouth flew open in surprise.",
    "\u2018Then my bit of thinking comes rather late in the day.\u2019\n\u2018It is never too late\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Not with me you understand.",
    "Thank you Mademoiselle.\u2019\nShe left us to return to Bryan Martin.",
    "\u2018There Poirot\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Surely that shakes your belief.\u2019\n\u2018No Hastings.",
    "On the contrary\u2014it strengthens it.\u2019\nDespite that valiant assertion I believed myself that secretly he had weakened.",
    "During the days that followed he never once mentioned the Edgware case.",
    "If I spoke of it he answered\nmonosyllabically and without interest.",
    "In other words he had washed his hands of it.",
    "Whatever he had\nhad lingering in his fantastic brain he had now been forced to admit that it had not materialized\u2014that his\nfirst conception of the case had been the true one and that Ronald Marsh was only too truly accused of\nthe crime.",
    "Only being Poirot he could not admit openly that such was the case Therefore he pretended\nto have lost interest.",
    "Such as I say was my interpretation of his attitude.",
    "It seemed borne out by the facts.",
    "He took no\nfaintest interest in the police court proceedings which in any case were purely formal.",
    "He busied himself\nwith other cases and as I say he displayed no interest when the subject was mentioned.",
    "It was nearly a fortnight later than the events mentioned in my last chapter when I came to realize that my\ninterpretation of his attitude was entirely wrong.",
    "It was breakfast time.",
    "The usual heavy pile of letters lay by Poirot\u2019s plate.",
    "He sorted through them with\nnimble fingers.",
    "Then he uttered a quick exclamation of pleasure and picked up a letter with an American\nstamp on it.",
    "He opened it with his little letteropener.",
    "I looked on with interest since he seemed so moved to pleasure\nabout it.",
    "There was a letter and a fairly thick enclosure.",
    "Poirot read the former through twice then he looked up.",
    "\u2018Would you like to see this Hastings\u2019\nI took it from him.",
    "It ran as follows\nDear M. Poirot\u2014I was much touched by your kind\u2014your very kind letter.",
    "I have been feeling so\nbewildered by everything.",
    "Apart from my terrible grief I have been so affronted by the things that seem\nto have been hinted about Carlotta\u2014the dearest sweetest sister that a girl ever had.",
    "No M. Poirot she\ndidnottake drugs.",
    "I\u2019m sure of it.",
    "She had a horror of that kind of thing.",
    "I\u2019ve often heard her say so.",
    "If she\nplayed a part in that poor man\u2019s death it was an entirely innocent one\u2014but of course her letter to me\nproves that.",
    "I am sending you the actual letter itself since you ask me to do so.",
    "I hate parting with the last\nletter she ever wrote but I know you will take care of it and let me have it back and if it helps you to\nclear up some of the mystery about her death as you say it may do\u2014why then of course it must go to\nyou.",
    "You ask whether Carlotta mentioned any friend specially in her letters.",
    "She mentioned a great many\npeople of course but nobody in a very outstanding way.",
    "Bryan Martin whom we used to know years\nago a girl called Jenny Driver and a Captain Ronald Marsh were I think the ones she saw most of.",
    "I wish I could think of something to help you.",
    "You write so kindly and with such understanding and you\nseem to realize what Carlotta and I were to each other.",
    "Gratefully yours\nLucie Adams\nP.S.",
    "An officer has just been here for the letter.",
    "I told him that I had already mailed it to you.",
    "This of\ncourse was not true but I felt somehow or other that it was important you should see it first.",
    "It seems\nScotland Yard need it as evidence against the murderer.",
    "You will take it to them.",
    "But oh please be sure\nthey let you have it back again some day.",
    "You see it is Carlotta\u2019s last words to me.",
    "\u2018So you wrote yourself to her\u2019 I remarked as I laid the letter down.",
    "\u2018Why did you do that Poirot And\nwhy did you ask for the original of Carlotta Adams\u2019 letter\u2019\nHe was bending over the enclosed sheets of the letter I mentioned.",
    "\u2018In verity I could not say Hastings\u2014unless it is that I hoped against hope that the original letter might in\nsome way explain the inexplicable.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t see how you can get away from the text of that letter.",
    "Carlotta Adams gave it herself to the maid\nto post.",
    "There was no hocus pocus about it.",
    "And certainly it reads as a perfectly genuine ordinary\nepistle.\u2019\nPoirot sighed.",
    "\u2018I know.",
    "I know.",
    "And that is what makes it so difficult.",
    "Because Hastings as it stands that letter is\nimpossible .\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Si si it is so.",
    "See you as I have reasoned it out certain thingsmust be\u2014they follow each other with\nmethod and order in an understandable fashion.",
    "But then comes this letter.",
    "It does not accord.",
    "Who\nthen is wrong Hercule Poirot or the letter\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t think it possible that it could be Hercule Poirot\u2019 I suggested as delicately as I was able.",
    "Poirot threw me a glance of reproof.",
    "\u2018There are times when I have been in error\u2014but this is not one of them.",
    "Clearly then since the letter\nseems impossible itis impossible.",
    "There is some fact about the letter which escapes us.",
    "I seek to discover\nwhat that fact is.\u2019\nAnd thereupon he resumed his study of the letter in question using a small pocket microscope.",
    "As he finished perusing each page he passed it across to me.",
    "I certainly could find nothing amiss.",
    "It\nwas written in a firm fairly legible handwriting and it was word for word as it had been telegraphed\nacross.",
    "Poirot sighed deeply.",
    "\u2018There is no forgery of any kind here\u2014no it is all written in the same hand.",
    "And yet since as I say it is\nimpossible\u2014\u2019\nHe broke off.",
    "With an impatient gesture he demanded the sheets from me.",
    "I passed them over and once\nagain he went slowly through them.",
    "Suddenly he uttered a cry.",
    "I had left the breakfast table and was standing looking out of the window.",
    "At this sound I turned\nsharply.",
    "Poirot was literally quivering with excitement.",
    "His eyes were green like a cat\u2019s.",
    "His pointing finger\ntrembled.",
    "\u2018See you Hastings Look here\u2014quickly\u2014come and look.\u2019\nI ran to his side.",
    "Spread out before him was one of the middle sheets of the letter.",
    "I could see nothing\nunusual about it.",
    "\u2018See you not All these other sheets they have the clean edge\u2014they are single sheets.",
    "But this\none\u2014see\u2014one side of it is ragged\u2014it has been torn.",
    "Now do you see what I meanThis letter was a\ndouble sheet  and so you comprehendone page of the letter is missing .\u2019\nI stared stupidly no doubt.",
    "\u2018But how can it be.",
    "It makes sense.\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes it makes sense.",
    "That is where the cleverness of the idea comes in.",
    "Read\u2014and you will see.\u2019\nI think I cannot do better than to apprehend a facsimile of the page in question.",
    "\u2018You see it now\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018The letter breaks off where she is talking of Captain Marsh.",
    "She is sorry\nfor him and then she says \u201cHe enjoyed my show very much.\u201d Then on the new sheet she goes on \u201che\nsaid\u2026\u201d Butmon ami  apage is missing .",
    "The \u201che\u201d of the new page may not be the \u201cHe\u201d of the old page.",
    "In fact it is not the \u201cHe\u201d of the old page .",
    "It is another man altogether who proposed that hoax.",
    "Observe\nnowhere after that is the name mentioned.",
    "AhC\u2019est \u00e9patant Somehow or other our murderer gets hold\nof this letter.",
    "It gives him away.",
    "No doubt he thinks to suppress it altogether and then\u2014reading it\nover\u2014he sees another way of dealing with it.",
    "Remove one page and the letter is capable of being\ntwisted into a damning accusation of another man\u2014a man too who has a motive for Lord Edgware\u2019s\ndeath.",
    "Ah it was a gift The money for theconfiture as you say He tears the sheet off and replaces the\nletter.\u2019\nI looked at Poirot in some admiration.",
    "I was not perfectly convinced of the truth of his theory.",
    "It seemed\nto be highly possible that Carlotta had used an odd half sheet that was already torn.",
    "But Poirot was so\ntransfigured with joy that I simply had not the heart to suggest this prosaic possibility.",
    "After all hemight\nbe right.",
    "I did however venture to point out one or two difficulties in the way of his theory.",
    "\u2018But how did the man whoever he was get hold of the letter Miss Adams took it straight from her\nhandbag and gave it herself to the maid to post.",
    "The maid told us so.\u2019\n\u2018Therefore we must assume one of two things.",
    "Either the maid was lying or else during that evening\nCarlotta Adams met the murderer.\u2019\nI nodded.",
    "\u2018It seems to me that that last possibility is the most likely one.",
    "We still do not know where Carlotta\nAdams was between the time she left the flat and nine o\u2019clock when she left her suitcase at Euston\nstation.",
    "During that time I believe myself that she met the murderer in some appointed spot\u2014they\nprobably had some food together.",
    "He gave her some last instructions.",
    "What happened exactly in regard\nto the letter we do not know.",
    "One can make a guess.",
    "She may have been carrying it in her hand meaning\nto post it.",
    "She may have laid it down on the table in the restaurant.",
    "He sees the address and scents a\npossible danger.",
    "He may have picked it up adroitly made an excuse for leaving the table opened it read\nit torn out the sheet and then either replaced it on the table or perhaps given it to her as she left telling\nher that she had dropped it without noticing.",
    "The exact way of it was not important\u2014but two things do\nseem clear.",
    "That Carlotta Adams met the murderer that evening either before the murder of Lord\nEdgware or afterwards there was time after she left the Corner House for a brief interview.",
    "I have a\nfancy though there I am perhaps wrong that it was the murderer who gave her the gold box\u2014it was\npossibly a sentimental memento of their first meeting.If so the murderer is D .\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t see the point of the gold box.\u2019\n\u2018Listen Hastings Carlotta Adams was not addicted to veronal.",
    "Lucie Adams says so and I too\nbelieve it to be true.",
    "She was a cleareyed healthy girl with no predilection for such things.",
    "None of her\nfriends nor her maid recognized the box.",
    "Why then was it found in her possession after she died To\ncreate the impression that shedid take veronal and that she had taken it for a considerable time\u2014that is\nto say at least six months.",
    "Let us say that she met the murderer after the murder if only for a few minutes.",
    "They had a drink together Hastings to celebrate the success of their plan.",
    "And in the girl\u2019s drink he put\nsufficient veronal to ensure that there should be no waking for her on the following morning.\u2019\n\u2018Horrible\u2019 I said with a shudder.",
    "\u2018Yes it was not pretty\u2019 said Poirot dryly.",
    "\u2018Are you going to tell Japp all this\u2019 I asked after a minute or two.",
    "\u2018Not at the moment.",
    "What have I got to tell He would say the excellent Japp \u201canother nest of the\nmare The girl wrote on an odd sheet of paper\u201dC\u2019est tout .\u2019\nI looked guiltily at the ground.",

    "And we should have noticed nothing.",
    "But nothing\u2019\n\n\f\u2018So we deduce that he is a man of careless habits\u2019 I said smiling.",
    "\u2018No no.",
    "He might have been in a hurry.",
    "You observe it is very carelessly torn.",
    "Oh assuredly he was\npressed for time.\u2019\nHe paused and then said\n\u2018One thing you do remark I hope.",
    "This man\u2014this D\u2014he must have had a very good alibi for that\nevening.\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t see how he could have had any alibi at all if he spent his time first at Regent Gate doing a murder\nand then with Carlotta Adams.\u2019\n\u2018Precisely\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018That is what I mean.",
    "He is badly in need of an alibi so no doubt he prepared\none.",
    "Another point Does his name really begin with D Or does D stand for some nickname by which he\nwas known to her\u2019\nHe paused and then said softly\n\u2018A man whose initial or whose nickname is D. We have got to find him Hastings.",
    "Yes we have got to\nfind him.\u2019\nChapter 24\nNews from Paris\nOn the following day we had an unexpected visit.",
    "Geraldine Marsh was announced.",

    "There were black circles round them as though she had not slept.",
    "Her face looked\nextraordinarily haggard and weary for one so young\u2014little more really than a child.",
    "\u2018I have come to see you M. Poirot because I don\u2019t know how to go on any longer.",
    "I am so terribly\nworried and upset.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Mademoiselle\u2019\nHis manner was gravely sympathetic.",
    "\u2018Ronald told me what you said to him that day.",
    "I mean that dreadful day when he was arrested.\u2019 She\nshivered.",
    "\u2018He told me that you came up to him suddenly just when he had said that he supposed no one\nwould believe him and that you said to him \u201cI believe you.\u201d Is that true M.

    "\u2018I\u2019m stupid.",
    "I say things badly.",
    "What I mean is\u2014you think you know who that somebody is\u2019\nShe leaned forward eagerly.",

    "\u2018It would be\u2014perhaps\u2014unfair.\u2019\n\u2018Then youhave got a definite suspicion of somebody\u2019\nPoirot merely shook his head noncommittally.",
    "\u2018If only I knew a little more\u2019 pleaded the girl.",
    "\u2018It would make it so much easier for me.",
    "And I might\nperhaps be able to help you.",
    "Yes really I might be able to help you.\u2019\nHer pleading was very disarming but Poirot continued to shake his head.",
    "\u2018The Duchess of Merton is still convinced it was my stepmother\u2019 said the girl thoughtfully.",

    "I was at school in Paris when my father married her.",
    "When I came home she\nwas quite kind.",
    "I mean she just didn\u2019t notice I was there.",
    "I thought her very emptyheaded and\u2014well\nmercenary.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018You spoke of the Duchess of Merton.",
    "You have seen much of her\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "She has been very kind to me.",
    "I have been with her a great deal during the last fortnight.",
    "It has\nbeen terrible\u2014with all the talk and the reporters and Ronald in prison and everything.\u2019 She shivered.",
    "\u2018I\nfeel I have no real friends.",
    "But the Duchess has been wonderful and he has been nice too\u2014her son I\n\n\fmean.\u2019\n\u2018You like him\u2019\n\u2018He is shy I think.",
    "Stiff and rather difficult to get on with.",

    "I\u2014I always thought he was wonderful.",
    "Always joking and thinking up mad things to do.",
    "Oh in that gloomy house of ours it made all the difference.\u2019\nPoirot nodded sympathetically but he went on to make a remark that shocked me in its crudity.",
    "\u2018You do not want to see him\u2014hanged then\u2019\n\u2018No no.\u2019 The girl shivered violently.",
    "\u2018Not that.",

    "It must be her.",
    "The Duchess says it must.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said Poirot.",

    "\u2018I comprehend.",
    "It gave you quite a turn.\u2019\n\u2018Yes it did.\u2019 She looked grateful for his sympathetic tone.",
    "\u2018It startled me you see.\u2019\n\u2018Quite quite.\u2019\n\u2018Ronnie just said \u201cHello Dina got them\u201d from behind me\u2014and it made me jump.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Poirot gently.",
    "\u2018As I said before it is a pity he did not stay outside.",
    "Then the taxidriver would\nhave been able to swear he never entered the house.\u2019\n\n\fShe nodded.",
    "Her tears began to fall splashing unheeded on her lap.",

    "No it has not\nbeen easy.",
    "Hastings will you get Mademoiselle a taxi\u2019\nI went down with the girl and saw her into the taxi.",
    "She had composed herself by now and thanked me\nvery prettily.",
    "I found Poirot walking up and down the room his brows knitted in thought.",
    "He looked unhappy.",

    "\u2018Who is that Oh it is Japp.Bonjour mon ami .\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s he got to say\u2019 I asked drawing nearer the telephone.",
    "Finally after various ejaculations Poirot spoke.",
    "\u2018Yes and who called for it Do they know\u2019\nWhatever the answer it was not what he expected.",
    "His face dropped ludicrously.",

    "Yes a detail as you say.\u2019\n\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019\n\u2018No I am still of the same opinion.",

    "Hastings that gold boxwas bought in Paris.",
    "It was ordered by letter and it comes\nfrom a wellknown Paris shop which specializes in such things.",

    "Chapter 25\nA Luncheon Party\nIt was I think on the day after that that we went to the Widburns\u2019 luncheon party at Claridge\u2019s.",
    "Neither Poirot nor I were particularly anxious to go.",
    "It was as a matter of fact about the sixth invitation\nwe had received.",
    "Mrs Widburn was a persistent woman and she liked celebrities.",
    "Undaunted by refusals\nshe finally offered such a choice of dates that capitulation was inevitable.",
    "Under those circumstances the\n\n\fsooner we went and got it over the better.",

    "To my remarks on the subject he returned always the same answer.",

    "There were more men than\nwomen and he was put next to me at table.",
    "Jane Wilkinson sat almost opposite us and next to her between her and Mrs Widburn sat the young\nDuke of Merton.",
    "I fancied\u2014of course it may have been only my fancy\u2014that he looked slightly ill at ease.",
    "The company in\nwhich he found himself was so I should imagine little to his liking.",
    "He was a strictly conservative and\nsomewhat reactionary young man\u2014the kind of character that seemed to have stepped out of the Middle\nAges by some regrettable mistake.",
    "His infatuation for the extremely modern Jane Wilkinson was one of\nthose anachronistic jokes that Nature so loves to play.",
    "Seeing Jane\u2019s beauty and appreciating the charm that her exquisitely husky voice lent to the most trite\nutterances I could hardly wonder at his capitulation.",
    "But one can get used to perfect beauty and an\nintoxicating voice It crossed my mind that perhaps even now a ray of commonsense was dissipating the\nmists of intoxicated love.",
    "It was a chance remark\u2014a rather humiliatinggaffe on Jane\u2019s part that gave me\nthat impression.",
    "Somebody\u2014I forgot who\u2014had uttered the phrase \u2018judgement of Paris\u2019 and straight away Jane\u2019s\ndelightful voice was uplifted.",

    "It\u2019s London and New York that count.\u2019\nAs sometimes happens the words fell in a momentary lull of conversation.",

    "Everyone hastily said something to somebody else.",
    "Jane alone looked serenely up and\ndown the table without the least consciousness of having said anything amiss.",
    "It was then I noticed the Duke.",
    "His lips were drawn tightly together he had flushed and it seemed to me\nas though he drew slightly away from Jane.",
    "He must have had a foretaste of the fact that for a man of his\nposition to marry a Jane Wilkinson might lead to some awkward contretemps.",
    "As so often happens I made the first remark that came into my head to my lefthand neighbour a stout\ntitled lady who arranged children\u2019s matinees.",
    "I remember that the remark in question was \u2018Who is that\nextraordinary looking woman in purple at the other end of the table\u2019 It was of course the lady\u2019s sister\nHaving stammered apologies I turned and chatted to Ross who answered in monosyllables.",
    "It was then rebuffed on both sides that I noticed Bryan Martin.",
    "He must have been late for I had not\nseen him before.",
    "He was a little way further down the table on my side and was leaning forward and chatting with great\nanimation to a pretty blonde woman.",
    "It was some time since I had seen him at close quarters and I was struck at once by the great\nimprovement in his looks.",
    "The haggard lines had almost disappeared.",
    "He looked younger and in every\nway more fit.",
    "He was laughing and chaffing his vis\u00e0vis and seemed in firstrate spirits.",

    "It was young Ross.",
    "\u2018Isn\u2019t M. Poirot here I wanted to speak to him.\u2019\nI explained that Poirot had just departed.",
    "Ross seemed taken aback.",
    "Looking more closely at him I saw that something seemed to have upset\nhim.",
    "He looked white and strained and he had a queer uncertain look in his eyes.",

    "He answered slowly.",

    "Thanks Hastings.",

    "Evidently what he had to tell was of supreme importance.\u2019\n\u2018But how could anyone know\u2019\n\u2018He spoke to you you say.",
    "There at Claridge\u2019s.",
    "With people all round.",

    "Inside was a big flight of stairs.",
    "\u2018So easy to come in.",
    "None to see\u2019 murmured Poirot as he sprang up the stairs.",
    "On the first floor was a kind of partition and a narrow door with a Yale lock.",
    "Ross\u2019s card was stuck in\nthe centre of the door.",
    "We paused there.",
    "Everywhere there was dead silence.",
    "I pushed the door\u2014to my surprise it yielded.",
    "We entered.",

    "Into this sittingroom we went.",

    "It was cheaply but\ncomfortably furnished and it was empty.",

    "\u2018Not here.",
    "Come Hastings.\u2019\nWe retraced our steps and going into the hall we passed through the other door.",
    "The room was a tiny\ndiningroom.",
    "At one side of the table fallen sideways from a chair and sprawled across the table was\nRoss.",
    "Poirot bent over him.",
    "He straightened up\u2014his face was white.",

    "Stabbed at the base of the skull.\u2019\nFor long afterwards the events of that afternoon remained like a nightmare in my mind.",

    "\u2018Yes yes we can know.",
    "Weshall know The power of the human brain Hastings is almost unlimited.",

    "\u2018What happened at that luncheon\u2019 he murmured.",
    "\u2018Some casual word or phrase must have shown to\nDonald Ross the significance of knowledge which was in his possession but which up to then he had not\nknown was significant.",
    "Was there some mention of France Of Paris Up your end of the table I mean.\u2019\n\u2018The word Paris was mentioned but not in that connection.\u2019\nI told him about Jane Wilkinson\u2019s \u2018gaffe\u2019.",
    "\u2018That probably explains it\u2019 he said thoughtfully.",

    "Suppose Ross suddenly\nremembered something which went to show that Merton wasnot in Paris.\u2019\n\u2018My dear Poirot\u2019\n\u2018Yes you consider that an absurdity.",
    "So does everyone.",
    "Had M.le Duc a motive for the crime Yes a\nvery strong one.",
    "But to suppose that he committed it\u2014oh absurd.",
    "He is so rich of so assured a\nposition of such a wellknown lofty character.",
    "No one will scrutinize his alibi too carefully.",

    "\u2018I remember now.\u2019\n\u2018Hastings I have had in mind all along a certain little idea.",
    "An idea as to who the man was\u2014the man\nbehind.",

    "But two\nof the questions Hastings I cannot answer.",
    "\u2018You see what that means.",

    "Or else the\nanswer to the two questions that I cannot answer is there all the time.",
    "Which is it Hastings Which is it\u2019\nRising he went to his desk unlocked it and took out the letter Lucie Adams had sent him from America.",
    "He had asked Japp to let him keep it a day or two and Japp had agreed.",
    "Poirot laid it on the table in\nfront of him and pored over it.",
    "The minutes went by.",
    "I yawned and picked up a book.",
    "I did not think that Poirot would get much result\nfrom his study.",
    "We had already gone over and over the letter.",
    "Granted that it was not Ronald Marsh who\nwas referred to there was nothing whatever to show who else it might be.",
    "I turned the pages of my book\u2026\nPossibly dozed off\u2026\nSuddenly Poirot uttered a low cry.",
    "I sat up abruptly.",
    "He was looking at me with an indescribable expression his eyes green and shining.",
    "\u2018Hastings Hastings.\u2019\n\u2018Yes what is it\u2019\n\u2018Do you remember I said to you that if the murderer had been a man of order and method he would\nhave cut this page not torn it\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018I was wrong.",
    "There is order and method throughout this crime.The page had to be torn not cut .",
    "Look\nfor yourself.\u2019\nI looked.",
    "\u2018Eh bien you see\u2019\nI shook my head.",
    "\u2018You mean he was in a hurry\u2019\n\u2018Hurry or no hurry it would be the same thing.",
    "Do you not see my friendThe page had to be torn \u2026\u2019\nI shook my head.",
    "In a low voice Poirot said\n\u2018I have been foolish.",
    "I have been blind.",
    "Butnow\u2014now \u2014we shall get on\u2019\nChapter 27\nConcerning PinceNez\nA minute later his mood had changed.",
    "He sprang to his feet.",
    "I also sprang to mine\u2014completely uncomprehending but willing.",
    "\u2018We will take a taxi.",
    "It is only nine o\u2019clock.",
    "Not too late to make a visit.\u2019\nI hurried after him down the stairs.",
    "\u2018Whom are we going to visit\u2019\n\u2018We are going to Regent Gate.\u2019\nI judged it wisest to hold my peace.",
    "Poirot I saw was not in the mood for being questioned.",
    "That he\nwas greatly excited I could see.",
    "As we sat side by side in the taxi his fingers drummed on his knees with a\nnervous impatience most unlike his usual calm.",
    "I went over in my mind every word of Carlotta Adams\u2019 letter to her sister.",
    "By this time I almost knew it\nby heart.",
    "I repeated again and again to myself Poirot\u2019s words about the torn page.",
    "But it was no good.",
    "As far as I was concerned Poirot\u2019s words simply did not make sense.",
    "Why had a\npagegot to be torn.",
    "No I could not see it.",
    "A new butler opened the door to us at Regent Gate.",
    "Poirot asked for Miss Carroll and as we followed\nthe butler up the stairs I wondered for the fiftieth time where the former \u2018Greek god\u2019 could be.",
    "So far the\npolice had failed utterly to run him to earth.",
    "A sudden shiver passed over me as I reflected that perhaps\nhe too was dead\u2026\nThe sight of Miss Carroll brisk and neat and eminently sane recalled me from these fantastic\nspeculations.",
    "She was clearly very much surprised to see Poirot.",
    "\u2018I am glad to find you still here Mademoiselle\u2019 said Poirot as he bowed over her hand.",
    "\u2018I was afraid\nyou might be no longer in the house.\u2019\n\u2018Geraldine would not hear of my leaving\u2019 said Miss Carroll.",
    "\u2018She begged me to stay on.",
    "And really at a\ntime like this the poor child needs someone.",
    "If she needs nothing else she needs a buffer.",
    "And I can\nassure you when need be I make a very efficient buffer M. Poirot.\u2019\nHer mouth took on a grim line.",
    "I felt that she would have a short way with reporters or news hunters.",
    "\u2018Mademoiselle you have always seemed to me the pattern of efficiency.",
    "The efficiency I admire it very\nmuch.",
    "It is rare.",
    "Mademoiselle Marsh no she has not got the practical mind.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s a dreamer\u2019 said Miss Carroll.",
    "\u2018Completely impractical.",
    "Always has been.",
    "Lucky she hasn\u2019t got\nher living to get.\u2019\n\u2018Yes indeed.\u2019\n\u2018But I don\u2019t suppose you came here to talk about people being practical or impractical.",
    "What can I do\nfor you M. Poirot\u2019\nI do not think Poirot quite liked to be recalled to the point in this fashion.",
    "He was somewhat addicted to\nthe oblique approach.",
    "With Miss Carroll however such a thing was not practicable.",
    "She blinked at him\nsuspiciously through her strong glasses.",
    "\u2018There are a few points on which I should like definite information.",
    "I know I can trust your memory\nMiss Carroll.\u2019\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be much use as a secretary if you couldn\u2019t\u2019 said Miss Carroll grimly.",
    "\u2018Was Lord Edgware in Paris last November\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Can you tell me the date of his visit\u2019\n\u2018I shall have to look it up.\u2019\nShe rose unlocked a drawer took out a small bound book turned the pages and finally announced\n\u2018Lord Edgware went to Paris on November 3rd and returned on the 7th.",
    "He also went over on\nNovember 20th and returned on December 4th.",
    "Anything more\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "For what purpose did he go\u2019\n\u2018On the first occasion he went to see some statuettes which he thought of purchasing and which were to\nbe auctioned later.",
    "On the second occasion he had no definite purpose in view so far as I know.\u2019\n\u2018Did Mademoiselle Marsh accompany her father on either occasion\u2019\n\u2018She never accompanied her father on any occasion M. Poirot.",
    "Lord Edgware would never have\ndreamed of such a thing.",
    "At that time she was at a convent in Paris but I do not think her father went to\nsee her or took her out\u2014at least it would surprise me very much if he had.\u2019\n\u2018You yourself did not accompany him\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\nShe looked at him curiously and then said abruptly\n\u2018Why are you asking me these questions M. Poirot What is the point of them\u2019\nPoirot did not reply to this question.",
    "Instead he said\n\u2018Miss Marsh is very fond of her cousin is she not\u2019\n\u2018Really M. Poirot I don\u2019t see what that has got to do with you.\u2019\n\u2018She came to see me the other day You knew that\u2019\n\u2018No I did not.\u2019 She seemed startled.",
    "\u2018What did she say\u2019\n\u2018She told me\u2014though not in actual words\u2014that she was very fond of her cousin.\u2019\n\u2018Well then why ask me\u2019\n\u2018Because I seek your opinion.\u2019\nThis time Miss Carroll decided to answer.",
    "\u2018Much too fond of him in my opinion.",
    "Always has been.\u2019\n\u2018You do not like the present Lord Edgware\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t say that.",
    "I\u2019ve no use for him that\u2019s all.",
    "He\u2019s not serious.",
    "I don\u2019t deny he\u2019s got a pleasant way\nwith him.",
    "He can talk you round.",
    "But I\u2019d rather see Geraldine getting interested in someone with a little\nmore backbone.\u2019\n\u2018Such as the Duke of Merton\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know the Duke.",
    "At any rate he seems to take the duties of his position seriously.",

    "But what can mothers do Sons never\nwant to marry the girls their mothers want them to marry.\u2019\n\u2018Do you think that Miss Marsh\u2019s cousin cares for her\u2019\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t matter whether he does or doesn\u2019t in the position he\u2019s in.\u2019\n\u2018You think then that he will be condemned\u2019\n\u2018No I don\u2019t.",
    "I don\u2019t think he did it.\u2019\n\u2018But he might be condemned all the same\u2019\nMiss Carroll did not reply.",

    "Very clever.\u2019\n\u2018Yes she was clever.\u2019 He seemed lost in meditation.",
    "\u2018Ah I have put down my gloves.\u2019\nReaching forward to get them from the table where he had laid them his cuff caught the chain of Miss\nCarroll\u2019s pincenez and jerked them off.",

    "Oh if I had only someone I could ask\u2026\u2019\nWe were passing a big cinema.",

    "Instinctively I put my hands over my eyes.",
    "There was a\njarring of brakes and some rich bus driver language.",
    "In a dignified manner Poirot walked to the kerb.",

    "Occasionally he murmured a\nword under his breath.",
    "I heard one or two of them.",
    "Once he said \u2018Candles\u2019 and another time he said\nsomething that sounded like \u2018douzaine\u2019.",
    "I suppose if I had been really bright I should have seen the line\nhis thoughts were taking.",
    "It was really such a clear trail.",
    "However at the time it sounded to me mere\ngibberish.",

    "I know her back side before as you say.\u2019\n\u2018Who then\u2019\nPoirot gave me one of his supremely irritating smiles and told me to wait and see.",
    "He then busied himself in tidying up the room in a fussy manner.",
    "Ten minutes later the maid arrived.",
    "She seemed a little nervous and uncertain.",
    "A small neat figure\ndressed in black she peered about her doubtfully.",

    "That is most kind.",

    "She looked disapproving.",
    "\u2018What I mean is you should have a good idea of who her enemies are likely to be.\u2019\nEllis compressed her lips more tightly.",
    "\u2018Most women have tried to do her a spiteful turn sir.",
    "Yes they\u2019ve all been against her nasty jealousy.\u2019\n\u2018Her own sex did not like her\u2019\n\u2018No sir.",
    "She\u2019s too good looking.",
    "And she always gets what she wants.",
    "There\u2019s a lot of nasty jealousy in\nthe theatrical profession.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018What about men\u2019\nEllis allowed a sour smile to appear on her withered countenance.",
    "\u2018She can do what she likes with the gentlemen sir and that\u2019s a fact.\u2019\n\u2018I agree with you\u2019 said Poirot smiling.",
    "\u2018Yet even allowing for that I can imagine circumstances\narising\u2014\u2019 He broke off.",
    "Then he said in a different voice\n\u2018You know Mr Bryan Martin the film actor\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018Very well\u2019\n\u2018Very well indeed.\u2019\n\u2018I believe I am not mistaken in saying that a little less than a year ago Mr Bryan Martin was very deeply\nin love with your mistress.\u2019\n\u2018Head over ears sir.",
    "And it\u2019s \u201cis\u201d not \u201cwas\u201d if you ask me.\u2019\n\u2018He believed at that time she would marry him\u2014eh\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018Did she ever seriously consider marrying him\u2019\n\u2018She thought of it sir.",
    "If she could have got her freedom from his lordship I believe she would have\nmarried him.\u2019\n\u2018And then I suppose the Duke of Merton appeared on the scene\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "He was doing a tour through the States.",
    "Love at first sight it was with him.\u2019\n\u2018And so goodbye to Bryan Martin\u2019s chances\u2019\nEllis nodded.",
    "\u2018Of course Mr Martin made an enormous amount of money\u2019 she explained.",
    "\u2018But the Duke of Merton\nhad position as well.",
    "And her ladyship is very keen on position.",
    "Married to the Duke she\u2019d have been\none of the first ladies in the land.\u2019\nThe maid\u2019s voice held a smug complacency.",
    "It amused me.",
    "\u2018So Mr Bryan Martin was\u2014how do you say\u2014turned down Did he take it badly\u2019\n\u2018He carried on something awful sir.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Ah\u2019\n\u2018He threatened her with a revolver once.",
    "And the scenes he made.",
    "It frightened me it did.",
    "He was\ndrinking a lot too.",
    "He went all to pieces.\u2019\n\u2018But in the end he calmed down.\u2019\n\u2018So it seemed sir.",
    "But he still hung about.",
    "And I didn\u2019t like the look in his eye.",
    "I\u2019ve warned her ladyship\nabout it but she only laughed.",
    "She\u2019s one who enjoys feeling her power if you know what I mean.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018I think I know what you mean.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ve not seen so much of him just lately sir.",
    "A good thing in my opinion.",
    "He\u2019s beginning to get over\nit I hope.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps.\u2019\nSomething in Poirot\u2019s utterance of the word seem to strike her.",
    "She asked anxiously\n\u2018You don\u2019t think she\u2019s in danger sir\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Poirot gravely.",
    "\u2018I think she is in great danger.",
    "But she has brought it on herself.\u2019\nHis hand running aimlessly along the mantelshelf caught a vase of roses and it toppled over.",
    "The water\nfell on Ellis\u2019s face and head.",
    "I had seldom known Poirot clumsy and I could deduce from it that he was\nin a great state of mental perturbation.",
    "He was very upset\u2014rushed for a towel\u2014tenderly assisted the\nmaid to dry her face and neck and was profuse in apologies.",
    "Finally a treasury note changed hands and he escorted her towards the door thanking her for her\ngoodness in coming.",
    "\u2018But it is still early\u2019 he said glancing at the clock.",
    "\u2018You will be back before your mistress returns.\u2019\n\u2018Oh that is quite all right sir.",
    "She is going out to supper I think and anyway she never expects me to\nsit up for her unless she says so special.\u2019\nSuddenly Poirot flew off at a tangent.",
    "\u2018Mademoiselle pardon me but you are limping.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s nothing sir.",
    "My feet are a little painful.\u2019\n\u2018The corns\u2019 murmured Poirot in the confidential voice of one sufferer to another.",
    "Corns apparently it was.",
    "Poirot expatiated upon a certain remedy which according to him worked\nwonders.",
    "Finally Ellis departed.",
    "I was full of curiosity.",
    "\u2018Well Poirot\u2019 I said.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019\nHe smiled at my eagerness.",
    "\u2018Nothing more this evening my friend.",
    "Tomorrow morning early we will ring up Japp.",
    "We will ask him\nto come round.",
    "We will also ring up Mr Bryan Martin.",
    "I think he will be able to tell us something\ninteresting.",
    "Also I wish to pay him a debt that I owe him.\u2019\n\u2018Really\u2019\nI looked at Poirot sideways.",
    "He was smiling to himself in a curious way.",
    "\u2018At any rate\u2019 I said \u2018you can\u2019t suspecthim of killing Lord Edgware.",
    "Especially after what we\u2019ve heard\nof tonight.",
    "That would be playing Jane\u2019s game with a vengeance.",
    "To kill off the husband so as to let the\nlady marry someone else is a little too disinterested for any man.\u2019\n\u2018What profound judgement\u2019\n\u2018Now don\u2019t be sarcastic\u2019 I said with some annoyance.",
    "\u2018And what on earth are you fiddling with all the\ntime\u2019\nPoirot held the object in question up.",
    "\u2018With the pincenez of the good Ellis my friend.",
    "She left them behind.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense She had them on her nose when she went out.\u2019\nHe shook his head gently.",
    "\u2018Wrong Absolutely wrong What she had on my dear Hastings were the pair of pincenez we found in\nCarlotta Adams\u2019 handbag.\u2019\nI gasped.",
    "Chapter 29\nPoirot Speaks\nIt fell to me to ring up Inspector Japp the following morning.",
    "His voice sounded rather depressed.",
    "\u2018Oh it\u2019s you Captain Hastings.",
    "Well what\u2019s in the wind now\u2019\nI gave him Poirot\u2019s message.",
    "\u2018Come round at eleven Well I dare say I could.",
    "He\u2019s not got anything to help us over young Ross\u2019s\ndeath has he I don\u2019t mind confessing that we could do with something.",
    "There\u2019s not a clue of any kind.",
    "Most mysterious business.\u2019\n\u2018I think he\u2019s got something for you\u2019 I said noncommittally.",
    "\u2018He seems very pleased with himself at all\n\n\fevents.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s more than I am I can tell you.",
    "All right Captain Hastings.",
    "I\u2019ll be there.\u2019\nMy next task was to ring up Bryan Martin.",
    "To him I said what I had been told to say That Poirot had\ndiscovered something rather interesting which he thought Mr Martin would like to hear.",
    "When asked\nwhat it was I said that I had no idea.",
    "Poirot had not confided in me.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "\u2018All right\u2019 said Bryan at last.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll come.\u2019\nHe rang off.",
    "Presently somewhat to my surprise Poirot rang up Jenny Driver and asked her also to be present.",
    "He was quiet and rather grave.",
    "I asked him no questions.",
    "Bryan Martin was the first to arrive.",
    "He looked in good health and spirits but\u2014or it might have been my\nfancy\u2014a shade uneasy.",
    "Jenny Driver arrived almost immediately afterwards.",
    "She seemed surprised to\nsee Bryan and he seemed to share her surprise.",
    "Poirot brought forward two chairs and urged them to sit down.",
    "He glanced at his watch.",
    "\u2018Inspector Japp will be here in one moment I expect.\u2019\n\u2018Inspector Japp\u2019 Bryan seemed startled.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2014I have asked him to come here\u2014informally\u2014as a friend.\u2019\n\u2018I see.\u2019\nHe relapsed into silence.",
    "Jenny gave a quick glance at him then glanced away.",
    "She seemed rather\npreoccupied about something this morning.",
    "A moment later Japp entered the room.",
    "He was I think a trifle surprised to find Bryan Martin and Jenny Driver there but he made no sign.",
    "He\ngreeted Poirot with his usual jocularity.",
    "\u2018Well M. Poirot what\u2019s it all about You\u2019ve got some wonderful theory or other I suppose.\u2019\nPoirot beamed at him.",
    "\u2018No no\u2014nothing wonderful.",
    "Just a little story quite simple\u2014so simple that I am ashamed not to have\nseen it at once.",
    "I want if you permit to take you with me through the case from the beginning.\u2019\nJapp sighed and looked at his watch.",
    "\u2018If you won\u2019t be more than an hour\u2014\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Reassure yourself\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018It will not take as long as that.",
    "See here you want to know do you\nnot who it was killed Lord Edgware who it was killed Miss Adams who it was killed Donald Ross\u2019\n\n\f\u2018I\u2019d like to know the last\u2019 said Japp cautiously.",
    "\u2018Listen to me and you shall know everything.",
    "See I am going to be humble.\u2019 Not likely I thought\nunbelievingly.",
    "\u2018I am going to show you every step of the way\u2014I am going to reveal how I was\nhoodwinked how I displayed the gross imbecility how it needed the conversation of my friend Hastings\nand a chance remark by a total stranger to put me on the right track.\u2019\nHe paused and then clearing his throat he began to speak in what I called his \u2018lecture\u2019 voice.",
    "\u2018I will begin at the supper party at the Savoy.",
    "Lady Edgware accosted me and asked for a private\ninterview.",
    "She wanted to get rid of her husband.",
    "At the close of our interview she said\u2014somewhat\nunwisely I thought\u2014that she might have to go round in a taxi and kill him herself.",
    "Those words were\nheard by Mr Bryan Martin who came in at that moment.\u2019\nHe wheeled round.",
    "\u2018Eh That is so is it not\u2019\n\u2018We all heard\u2019 said the actor.",
    "\u2018The Widburns Marsh Carlotta\u2014all of us.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I agree.",
    "I agree perfectly.Eh bien  I did not have a chance to forget those words of Lady\nEdgware\u2019s.",
    "Mr Bryan Martin called on the following morning for the express purpose of driving those\nwords home.\u2019\n\u2018Not at all\u2019 cried Bryan Martin angrily.",
    "\u2018I came\u2014\u2019\nPoirot held up a hand.",
    "\u2018You came ostensibly to tell me a cockandbull story about being shadowed.",
    "A tale that a child might\nhave seen through.",
    "You probably took it from an outofdate film.",
    "A girl whose consent you had to\nobtain\u2014a man whom you recognized by a gold tooth.Mon ami  noyoung man would have a gold\ntooth\u2014it is not done in these days\u2014and especially in America.",
    "The gold tooth it is a hopelessly\noldfashioned piece of dentistry.",
    "Oh it was all of a piece\u2014absurd Having told your cockandbull story\nyou get down to the real purpose of your visit\u2014to poison my mind against Lady Edgware.",
    "To put it\nclearly you prepare the ground for the moment when she murders her husband.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2019 muttered Bryan Martin.",
    "His face was deathly pale.",
    "\u2018You ridicule the idea that he will agree to a divorce You think I am going to see him the following day\nbut actually the appointment is changed.",
    "I go to see him that morning and hedoes agree to a divorce.",
    "Any\nmotive for a crime on Lady Edgware\u2019s part is gone.",
    "Moreover he tells me that he has already written to\nLady Edgware to that effect.",
    "\u2018But Lady Edgware declares that she never got that letter.",
    "Either she lies her husband lies or somebody\nhas suppressed it\u2014who\n\u2018Now I ask myselfwhy does M. Bryan Martin give himself the trouble to come and tell me all these lies\nWhat inner power drives him on.",
    "And I form the idea Monsieur that you have been frantically in love\nwith that lady.",
    "Lord Edgware says that his wife told him she wanted to marry an actor.",
    "Well supposing\nthat is so but that the lady changes her mind.",
    "By the time Lord Edgware\u2019s letter agreeing to the divorce\n\n\farrives it is someone else she wants to marry\u2014not you There would be a reason then for you\nsuppressing that letter.\u2019\n\u2018I never\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Presently you shall say all you want to say.",
    "Now you will attend to me.",
    "\u2018What then would be your frame of mind\u2014you a spoilt idol who has never known a rebuff As I see\nit a kind of baffled fury a desire to do Lady Edgware as much harm as possible.",
    "And what greater harm\ncould you do her than to have her accused\u2014perhaps hanged\u2014for murder.\u2019\n\u2018Good lord\u2019 said Japp.",
    "Poirot turned to him.",
    "\u2018But yes that was the little idea that began to shape itself in my mind.",
    "Several things came to support it.",
    "Carlotta Adams had two principal men friends\u2014Captain Marsh and Bryan Martin.",
    "It was possible then\nthat Bryan Martin a rich man was the one who suggested the hoax and offered her ten thousand dollars\nto carry it through.",
    "It has seemed to me unlikely all along that Miss Adams could ever have believed\nRonald Marsh would have ten thousand dollars to give her.",
    "She knew him to be extremely hard up.",
    "Bryan Martin was a far more likely solution.\u2019\n\u2018I didn\u2019t\u2014I tell you\u2014\u2019 came hoarsely from the film actor\u2019s lips.",
    "\u2018When the substance of Miss Adams\u2019 letter to her sister was wired from Washington\u2014ohla la  I was\nvery upset.",
    "It seemed that my reasoning was wholly wrong.",
    "But later I made a discovery.",
    "The actual\nletter itself was sent to me and instead of being continuous a sheet of the letter was missing.So \u201che\u201d\nmight refer to someone who was not Captain Marsh.",
    "\u2018There was one more piece of evidence.",
    "Captain Marsh when he was arrested distinctly stated that he\nthought he saw Bryan Martin enter the house.",
    "Coming from an accused man that carried no weight.",
    "Also\nM. Martin had an alibi.",
    "That naturally It was to be expected.",
    "If M. Martin did the murder to have an\nalibi was absolutely necessary.",
    "\u2018That alibi was vouched for by one person only\u2014Miss Driver.\u2019\n\u2018What about it\u2019 said the girl sharply.",
    "\u2018Nothing Mademoiselle\u2019 said Poirot smiling.",
    "\u2018Except that that same day I noticed you lunching with M.\nMartin and that you presently took the trouble to come over and try to make me believe that your friend\nMiss Adams was specially interested in Ronald Marsh\u2014not as I was sure was the case\u2014in Bryan\nMartin.\u2019\n\u2018Not a bit of it\u2019 said the film star stoutly.",
    "\u2018You may have been unaware of it Monsieur\u2019 said Poirot quietly \u2018but I think it was true.",
    "It explains as\nnothing else could her feeling of dislike towards Lady Edgware.",
    "That dislike was on your behalf.",
    "You\nhad told her all about your rebuff had you not\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2014yes\u2014I felt I must talk to someone and she\u2014\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Was sympathetic.",
    "Yes she was sympathetic I noticed it myself.Eh bien  what happens next Ronald\nMarsh he is arrested.",
    "Immediately your spirits improve.",
    "Any anxiety you may have had is over.",
    "Although\nyour plan has miscarried owing to Lady Edgware\u2019s change of mind about going to a party at the last\nminute yet somebody else has become the scapegoat and relieved you of all anxiety on your own\naccount.",
    "And then\u2014at a luncheon party\u2014you hear Donald Ross that pleasant but rather stupid young\nman say something to Hastings that seems to show that you are not so safe after all.\u2019\n\u2018It isn\u2019t true\u2019 the actor bawled.",
    "The perspiration was running down his face.",
    "His eyes looked wild with\nhorror.",
    "\u2018I tell you I heard nothing\u2014nothing\u2014I did nothing.\u2019\nThen I think came the greatest shock of the morning.",
    "\u2018That is quite true\u2019 said Poirot quietly.",
    "\u2018And I hope you have now been sufficiently punished for coming\nto me\u2014me Hercule Poirot with a cockandbull story.\u2019\nWe all gasped.",
    "Poirot continued dreamily.",
    "\u2018You see\u2014I am showing you all my mistakes.",
    "There were five questions I had asked myself.",
    "Hastings\nknows them.",
    "The answer to three of them fitted in very well.",
    "Who had suppressed that letter Clearly\nBryan Martin answered that question very well.",
    "Another question was what had induced Lord Edgware\nsuddenly to change his mind and agree to a divorce Well I had an idea as to that.",
    "Either he wanted to\nmarry again\u2014but I could find no evidence pointing to that\u2014or else some kind of blackmail was involved.",
    "Lord Edgware was a man of peculiar tastes.",
    "It was possible that facts about him had come to light which\nwhile not entitling his wife to an English divorce might yet be used by her as a lever coupled with the\nthreat of publicity.",
    "I think that is what happened.",
    "Lord Edgware did not want an open scandal attached\nto his name.",
    "He gave in though his fury at having to do so was expressed in the murderous look on his\nface when he thought himself unobserved.",
    "It also explains the suspicious quickness with which he said\n\u201cNot because of anything in the letter\u201d before I had even suggested that that might be the case.",
    "\u2018Two questions remained.",
    "The question of an odd pair of pincenez in Miss Adams\u2019 bag which did not\nbelong to her.",
    "And the question of why Lady Edgware was rung up on the telephone whilst she was at\ndinner at Chiswick.",
    "In no way could I fit in M. Bryan Martin with either of those questions.",
    "\u2018So I was forced to the conclusion that either I was wrong about Mr Martin or wrong about the\nquestions.",
    "In despair I once again read that letter of Miss Adams\u2019 through very carefully.",
    "And I found\nsomething Yes I found something\n\u2018See for yourselves.",
    "Here it is.",
    "You see the sheet is torn Unevenly as often happens.",
    "Supposing now\nthat before the \u201ch\u201d at the top there was an \u201cs\u201d\u2026\n\u2018Ah you have it You see.",
    "Nothe \u2014butshe  It was awoman who suggested this hoax to Carlotta\nAdams.",
    "\u2018Well I made a list of all the women who had been even remotely connected with the case.",
    "Besides\nJane Wilkinson there were four\u2014Geraldine Marsh Miss Carroll Miss Driver and the Duchess of\nMerton.",
    "\u2018Of those four the one that interested me most was Miss Carroll.",
    "She wore glasses she was in the\nhouse that night she had already been inaccurate in her evidence owing to her desire to incriminate Lady\nEdgware and she was also a woman of great efficiency and nerve who could have carried out such a\ncrime.",
    "The motive was more obscure\u2014but after all she had worked with Lord Edgware some years and\n\n\fsome motive might exist of which we were totally unaware.",
    "\u2018I also felt that I could not quite dismiss Geraldine Marsh from the case.",
    "She hated her father\u2014she had\ntold me so.",
    "She was a neurotic highlystrung type.",
    "Suppose when she went into the house that night she\nhad deliberately stabbed her father and then coolly proceeded upstairs to fetch the pearls.",
    "Imagine her\nagony when she found that her cousin whom she loved devotedly had not remained outside in the taxi but\nhad entered the house.",
    "\u2018Her agitated manner could be well explained on these lines.",
    "It could equally well be explained by her\nown innocence but by her fear that her cousin really had done the crime.",
    "There was another small point.",
    "The gold box found in Miss Adams\u2019 bag had the initial D in it.",
    "I had heard Geraldine addressed by her\ncousin as \u201cDina\u201d.",
    "Also she was in a pensionnat in Paris last November and might possibly have met\nCarlotta Adams in Paris.",
    "\u2018You may think it fantastic to add the Duchess of Merton to the list.",
    "But she had called upon me and I\nrecognized in her a fanatical type.",
    "The love of her whole life was centred on her son and she might have\nworked herself up to contrive a plot to destroy the woman who was about to ruin her son\u2019s life.",
    "\u2018Then there was Miss Jenny Driver\u2014\u2019\nHe paused looking at Jenny.",
    "She looked back at him an impudent head on one side.",
    "\u2018And what have you got on me\u2019 she asked.",
    "\u2018Nothing Mademoiselle except that you were a friend of Bryan Martin\u2019s\u2014and that your surname\nbegins with D.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s not very much.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s one thing more.",
    "You have the brains and the nerve to commit such a crime.",
    "I doubt if anyone\nelse had.\u2019\nThe girl lit a cigarette.",
    "\u2018Continue\u2019 she said cheerfully.",
    "\u2018Was M. Martin\u2019s alibi genuine or was it not That was what I had to decide.",
    "If it was who was it\nRonald Marsh had seen go into the house And suddenly I remembered something.",
    "The goodlooking\nbutler at Regent Gate bore a very marked resemblance to M. Martin.",
    "It was he whom Captain Marsh\nhad seen.",
    "And I formed a theory as to that.",
    "It is my idea that he discovered his master killed.",
    "Beside his\nmaster was an envelope containing French banknotes to the value of a hundred pounds.",
    "He took these\nnotes slipped out of the house left them in safe keeping with some rascally friend and returned letting\nhimself in with Lord Edgware\u2019s key.",
    "He let the crime be discovered by the housemaid on the following\nmorning.",
    "He felt in no danger himself as he was quite convinced that Lady Edgware had done the\nmurder and the notes were out of the house and already changed before their loss was noticed.",
    "However when Lady Edgware had an alibi and Scotland Yard began investigating his antecedents he\ngot the wind up and decamped.\u2019\nJapp nodded approvingly.",
    "\u2018I still have the question of the pincenez to settle.",
    "If Miss Carroll was the owner then the case seemed\n\n\fsettled.",
    "She could have suppressed the letter and in arranging details with Carlotta Adams or in meeting\nher on the evening of the murder the pincenez might have inadvertently found their way into Carlotta\nAdams\u2019 bag.",
    "\u2018But the pincenez were apparently nothing to do with Miss Carroll.",
    "I was walking home with Hastings\nhere somewhat depressed trying to arrange things in my mind with order and method.",
    "And then the\nmiracle happened\n\u2018First Hastings spoke of things in a certain order.",
    "He mentioned Donald Ross having been one of thirteen\nat table at Sir Montagu Corner\u2019s and having been the first to get up.",
    "I was following out a train of thought\nof my own and did not pay much attention.",
    "It just flashed through my mind that strictly speaking that\nwas not true.",
    "He may have got up first at the end of the dinner but actually Lady Edgware had been the\nfirst to get up since she was called to the telephone.",
    "Thinking of her a certain riddle occurred to me\u2014a\nriddle that I fancied accorded well with her somewhat childish mentality.",
    "I told it to Hastings.",
    "He was\nlike Queen Victoria not amused.",
    "I next fell to wondering who I could ask for details about M. Martin\u2019s\nfeeling for Jane Wilkinson.",
    "She herself would not tell me I knew.",
    "And then a passerby as we were all\ncrossing the road uttered a simple sentence.",
    "\u2018He said to his girl companion that somebody or other \u201cshould have asked Ellis\u201d.",
    "And immediately the\nwhole thing came to me in a flash\u2019\nHe looked round.",
    "\u2018Yes yes the pincenez the telephone call the short woman who called for the gold box in Paris.Ellis \nof course Jane Wilkinson\u2019s maid.",
    "I followed every step of it\u2014the candles\u2014the dim light\u2014Mrs Van\nDusen\u2014everything.",
    "Iknew \u2019\nChapter 30\nThe Story\nHe looked round at us.",
    "\u2018Come my friends\u2019 he said gently.",
    "\u2018Let me tell you the real story of what happened that night.",
    "\u2018Carlotta Adams leaves her flat at seven o\u2019clock.",
    "From there she takes a taxi and goes to the Piccadilly\nPalace.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019 I exclaimed.",
    "\u2018To the Piccadilly Palace.",
    "Earlier in the day she has taken a room there as Mrs Van Dusen.",
    "She wears a\npair of strong glasses which as we all know alters the appearance very much.",
    "As I say she books a\nroom saying that she is going by the night boat train to Liverpool and that her luggage has gone on.",
    "At\neightthirty Lady Edgware arrives and asks for her.",
    "She is shown up to her room.",
    "There they change\nclothes.",
    "Dressed in a fair wig a white taffeta dress and ermine wrapCarlotta Adams and not Jane\nWilkinson leaves the\nhotel and drives to Chiswick.",
    "Yes yes it is perfectly possible.",
    "I have been to the house in the evening.",
    "The dinner table is lit only with candles the lamps are dim no one there knows Jane Wilkinson very well.",
    "There is the golden hair the wellknown husky voice and manner.",
    "Oh it was quite easy.",
    "And if it had not\nbeen successful\u2014if someone had spotted the fake\u2014well that was all arranged for too.",
    "Lady Edgware\n\n\fwearing a dark wig Carlotta\u2019s clothes and the pincenez pays her bill has her suitcase put on a taxi and\ndrives to Euston.",
    "She removes the dark wig in the lavatory she puts her suitcase in the cloakroom.",
    "Before going to Regent Gate she rings up Chiswick and asks to speak to Lady Edgware.",
    "This has been\narranged between them.",
    "If all has gone well and Carlotta has not been spotted she is to answer\nsimply\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I need hardly say Miss Adams was ignorant of the real reason for the telephone\ncall.",
    "Having heard the words Lady Edgware goes ahead.",
    "She goes to Regent Gate asks for Lord\nEdgware proclaims her individuality and goes into the library.And commits the first murder .",
    "Of course\nshe did not know that Miss Carroll was watching her from above.",
    "As far as she is aware it will be the\nbutler\u2019s word and he has never seen her remember\u2014and also she wears a hat which shields her from\nhis gaze against the word of twelve wellknown and distinguished people.",
    "\u2018She leaves the house returns to Euston changes from fair to dark again and picks up her suitcase.",
    "She\nhas now to put in time till Carlotta Adams returns from Chiswick.",
    "They have agreed as to the\napproximate time.",
    "She goes to the Corner House occasionally glancing at her watch for the time passes\nslowly.",
    "Then she prepares for the second murder.",
    "She puts the small gold box she has ordered from\nParis in Carlotta Adams\u2019 bag which of course she is carrying.",
    "Perhaps it is then she finds the letter.",
    "Perhaps it was earlier.",
    "Anyway as soon as she sees the address she scents danger.",
    "She opens it\u2014her\nsuspicions are justified.",
    "\u2018Perhaps her first impulse is to destroy the letter altogether.",
    "But she soon sees a better way.",
    "By\nremoving one page of the letter it reads like an accusation of Ronald Marsh\u2014a man who had a powerful\nmotive for the crime.",
    "Even if Ronald has an alibi it will still read as an accusation of a man so long as she\ntears off the s of \u201cshe\u201d.",
    "So that is what she does.",
    "Then replaces it in the envelope and the envelope back\nin the bag.",
    "\u2018Then the time having come she walks in the direction of the Savoy Hotel.",
    "As soon as she sees the car\npass with presumably herself inside she quickens her pace enters at the same time and goes straight\nup the stairs.",
    "She is inconspicuously dressed in black.",
    "It is unlikely that anyone will notice her.",
    "\u2018Upstairs she goes to her room.",
    "Carlotta Adams has just reached it.",
    "The maid has been told to go to\nbed\u2014a perfectly usual proceeding.",
    "They again change clothes and then I fancy Lady Edgware suggests\na little drink\u2014to celebrate.",
    "In that drink is the veronal.",
    "She congratulates her victim says she will send\nher the cheque tomorrow.",
    "Carlotta Adams goes home.",

    "It is at a luncheon party.",
    "Sir Montagu Corner makes a reference to a\nconversation he had with Lady Edgware on the night of the murder.",
    "That is easy.",
    "But Nemesis comes\nupon her later.",
    "There is a mention of the \u201cjudgement of Paris\u201d and she takes Paris to be the only Paris she\nknows\u2014the Paris of fashion and frills\n\u2018But opposite her is sitting a young man who was at the dinner at Chiswick\u2014a young man who heard\nthe Lady Edgware of that night discussing Homer and Greek civilization generally.",

    "He cannot understand.",

    "And then swift and sure she strikes\u2014as before.",
    "Perhaps he gives a choked cry\u2014no\nmore.",
    "He too is silenced.\u2019\nThere was a silence.",
    "Then Japp spoke hoarsely.",

    "\u2018But why if he was willing to give her a divorce\u2019\n\u2018Because the Duke of Merton is a pillar of the AngloCatholics.",
    "Because he would not dream of\nmarrying a woman whose husband was alive.",
    "He is a young man of fanatical principles.",
    "As a widow she\nwas pretty certain to be able to marry him.",
    "Doubtless she had tentatively suggested divorce but he had\nnot risen to the bait.\u2019\n\u2018Then why send you to Lord Edgware\u2019\n\u2018Ah parbleu\u2019 Poirot from having been very correct and English suddenly relapsed into his natural self.",
    "\u2018To pull the cottonwool over my eyes To make me a witness to the fact that there was not motive for\nthe murder Yes she dared to make me Hercule Poirot her cat\u2019spawMa foi  she succeeded too\nOh that strange brain childlike and cunning.",
    "She can act How well she acted surprise at being told of\nthe letter her husband had written her which she swore she had never received.",
    "Did she feel the slightest\npang of remorse for any of her three crimes I can swear she did not.\u2019\n\u2018I told you what she was like\u2019 cried Bryan Martin.",
    "\u2018I told you.",

    "\u2018And the gold box with the initial D and Paris November inside\u2019 said Japp.",
    "\u2018She ordered that by letter and sent Ellis her maid to fetch it.",

    "He\u2019s going to\nmarry and stick to me.\u2019\nPoirot looked at her\u2014looked at her determined chin\u2014and at her flaming hair.",

    "So it happened that I never saw Jane\nWilkinson again and only read in the paper of her trial and condemnation.",
    "Unexpectedly at least\nunexpectedly to me she went completely to pieces when charged with the truth.",
    "So long as she was able\nto be proud of her cleverness and act her part she made no mistakes but once her selfconfidence failed\nher owing to someone having found her out she was as incapable as a child would be of keeping up a\ndeception.",
    "Crossexamined she went completely to pieces.",
    "So as I said before that luncheon party was the last time I saw Jane Wilkinson.",
    "But when I think of her\nI always see her the same way\u2014standing in her room at the Savoy trying on expensive black clothes with\na serious absorbed face.",
    "I am convinced that that was no pose.",
    "She was being completely natural.",
    "Her\nplan had succeeded and therefore she had no further qualms and doubts.",
    "Neither do I think that she ever\nsuffered one pang of remorse for the three crimes she had committed.",
    "I reproduce here a document which she had directed was to be sent to Poirot after her death.",
    "It is I\nthink typical of that very lovely and completely conscienceless lady.",
    "Dear M. Poirot I have been thinking things over and I feel that I should like to write this for you.",
    "I know\nthat you sometimes publish reports of your cases.",
    "I don\u2019t really think that you\u2019ve ever published a\ndocument by the person themselves.",
    "I feel too that I would like everyone to know just exactly how I did\nit all.",
    "I still think it was all very well planned.",
    "If it hadn\u2019t been for you everything would have been quite all\nright.",
    "I\u2019ve felt rather bitter about that but I suppose you couldn\u2019t help it.",
    "I\u2019m sure if I send you this\nyou\u2019ll give it plenty of prominence.",
    "You will won\u2019t you I should like to be remembered.",
    "And I do think\nI am really a unique person.",
    "Everybody here seems to think so.",
    "It began in America when I got to know Merton.",
    "I saw at once that if only I were a widow he would\nmarry me.",
    "Unfortunately he has got a queer sort of prejudice against divorce.",
    "I tried to overcome it but it\nwas no good and I had to be careful because he was a very kinky sort of person.",
    "I soon realized that my husband simply had got to die but I didn\u2019t know how to set about it.",
    "You can\nimagine things like that ever so much better in the States.",
    "I thought and I thought\u2014but I couldn\u2019t see how\nto arrange it.",
    "And then suddenly I saw Carlotta Adams do her imitation of me and at once I began to\nsee a way.",
    "With her help I could get an alibi.",
    "That same evening I saw you and it suddenly struck me\nthat it would be a good idea to send you to my husband to ask him for a divorce.",
    "At the same time I\nwould go about talking of killing my husband because I\u2019ve always noticed that if you speak the truth in a\nrather silly way nobody believes you.",
    "I\u2019ve often done it over contracts.",
    "And it\u2019s also a good thing to\nseem stupider than you are.",
    "At my second meeting with Carlotta Adams I broached the idea.",
    "I said it\nwas a bet and she fell for it at once.",
    "She was to pretend to be me at some party and if she got away with\nit she was to have ten thousand dollars.",
    "She was very enthusiastic and several of the ideas were\nhers\u2014about changing clothes and all that.",
    "You see we couldn\u2019t do it here because of Ellis and we\ncouldn\u2019t do it at her place because of her maid.",
    "She of course didn\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t.",
    "It was a little\nawkward.",
    "I just said \u2018No.\u2019 She thought me a little stupid about it but she gave in and we thought of the\nhotel plan.",
    "I took a pair of Ellis\u2019s pincenez.",
    "Of course I realized quite soon that she would have to be got out of the way too.",
    "It was a pity but after\nall those imitations of hers really were very impertinent.",
    "If mine hadn\u2019t happened to suit me I\u2019d have been\nangry about it.",
    "I had some veronal myself though I hardly ever take it so that was quite easy.",
    "And then I\nhad quite a brainwave.",
    "You see it would be so much better if it could seem that she was in the habit of\ntaking it.",
    "I ordered a box\u2014the duplicate of one I\u2019d been given and I had her initials put on it and an\ninscription inside.",
    "I thought if I put some odd initial and Paris November inside it it would make it all\nmuch more difficult.",
    "I wrote for the box from the Ritz when I was in there lunching one day.",
    "And I sent\nEllis over to fetch it.",
    "She didn\u2019t know what it was of course.",
    "Everything went off quite well on the night.",
    "I took one of Ellis\u2019s corn knives while she was over in Paris\nbecause it was nice and sharp.",
    "She never noticed because I put it back afterwards.",
    "It was a doctor in\nSan Francisco who showed me just where to stick it in.",
    "He\u2019d been talking about lumbar and cistern\npunctures and he said one had to be very careful otherwise one went through the cistertia magna and\ninto the medulla oblongata where all the vital nerve centres are and that that would cause immediate\ndeath.",
    "I made him show me the exact place several times.",
    "I thought it might perhaps come in useful one\n\n\fday.",
    "I told him I wanted to use the idea in a film.",
    "It was very dishonourable of Carlotta Adams to write to her sister.",
    "She\u2019d promised me to tell nobody.",
    "I\ndo think it was clever of me to see what a good thing it would be to tear off that one page and leave he\ninstead of she.",
    "I thought of that all by myself.",
    "I think I\u2019m more proud of that than anything else.",
    "Everyone\nalways says I haven\u2019t got brains\u2014but I think it needed real brains to think of that.",
