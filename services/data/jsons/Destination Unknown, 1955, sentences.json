    "DESTINATION UNKOWN\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nThe man behind the desk moved a heavy glass paper weight four\ninches to the right.",
    "His face was not so much thoughtful or\nabstracted as expressionless.",
    "He had the pale complexion that\ncomes from living most of the day in artificial light.",
    "This man you\nfelt was an indoor man.",
    "A man of desks and files.",
    "The fact that to\nreach his office you had to walk through long twisting underground\ncorridors was somehow strangely appropriate.",
    "It would have been\ndifficult to guess his age.",
    "He looked neither old nor young.",
    "His face\nwas smooth and unwrinkled and in his eyes was a great tiredness.",
    "The other man in the room was older.",
    "He was dark with a small\nmilitary moustache.",
    "There was about him an alert nervous energy.",
    "Even now unable to sit still he was pacing up and down from time\nto time throwing off a remark in a jerky manner.",
    "Reports he said explosively.",
    "Reports reports and more reports\nand none of them any damn good\n\nThe man at the desk looked down at the papers in front of him.",
    "On\ntop was an official card headed Betterton Thomas Charles.",
    "After\nthe name was an interrogation mark.",
    "The man at the desk nodded\nthoughtfully.",
    "He said\n\nYouve followed up these reports and none of them any good\n\n\fThe other shrugged his shoulders.",
    "How can one tell he asked.",
    "The man behind the desk sighed.",
    "Yes he said there is that.",
    "One cant tell really.",
    "The older man went on with a kind of machine gun volley\nabruptness.",
    "Reports from Rome reports from Touraine seen on the Riviera\nnoticed in Antwerp definitely identified in Oslo positively seen in\nBiarritz observed behaving suspiciously in Strasburg seen on the\nbeach at Ostend with a glamorous blonde noticed walking in the\nstreets in Brussels with a greyhound Hasnt been seen yet in the\nZoo with his arm round a zebra but I daresay that will come\n\nYouve no particular fancy yourself Wharton Personally I had\nhopes of the Antwerp report but it hasnt led to anything.",
    "Of course\nby now... the young man stopped speaking and seemed to go into\na coma.",
    "Presently he came out of it again and said cryptically Yes\nprobably... and yet  I wonder\n\nColonel Wharton sat down abruptly on the arm of a chair.",
    "But weve got to find out he said insistently.",
    "Weve got to break\nthe back of all this how and why and where You cant lose a tame\nscientist every month or so and have no idea how they go or why\n\n\fthey go or where Is it where we think  or isnt it Weve always\ntaken it for granted that it is but now Im not so sure.",
    "Youve read\nall the last dope on Betterton from America\n\nThe man behind the desk nodded.",
    "Usual Left Wing tendencies at the period when everyone had\nthem.",
    "Nothing of a lasting or permanent nature as far as can be\nfound out.",
    "Did sound work before the war though nothing\nspectacular.",
    "When Mannheim escaped from Germany Betterton\nwas assigned as Assistant to him and ended by marrying\nMannheims daughter.",
    "After Mannheims death he carried on on his\nown and did brilliant work.",
    "He leaped into fame with the startling\ndiscovery of ZE Fission.",
    "ZE Fission was a brilliant and absolutely\nrevolutionary discovery.",
    "It put Betterton absolutely tops.",
    "He was all\nset for a brilliant career over there but his wife had died soon after\ntheir marriage and he was all broken up over it.",
    "He came to\nEngland.",
    "He has been at Harwell for the last eighteen months.",
    "Just\nsix months ago he married again.",
    "Anything there asked Wharton sharply.",
    "The other shook his head.",
    "Not that we can find out.",
    "Shes the daughter of a local solicitor.",
    "Worked in an insurance office before her marriage.",
    "No violent\npolitical affinities so far as weve been able to discover.",
    "ZE Fission said Colonel Wharton gloomily with distaste.",
    "What\nthey mean by all these terms beats me.",
    "Im old fashioned.",
    "I never\n\n\freally even visualised a molecule but here they are nowadays\nsplitting up the universe Atom bombs Nuclear fission ZE fission\nand all the rest of it.",
    "And Betterton was one of the splitters in chief\nWhat do they say of him at Harwell\n\nQuite a pleasant personality.",
    "As to his work nothing outstanding\nor spectacular.",
    "Just variations on the practical applications of\nZEF.",
    "Both men were silent for a moment.",
    "Their conversation had been\ndesultory almost automatic.",
    "The security reports lay in a pile on\nthe desk and the security reports had had nothing of value to tell.",
    "He was thoroughly screened on arrival here of course said\nWharton.",
    "Yes everything was quite satisfactory.",
    "Eighteen months ago said Wharton thoughtfully.",
    "It gets em\ndown you know.",
    "Security precautions.",
    "The feeling of being\nperpetually under the microscope the cloistered life.",
    "They get\nnervy queer.",
    "Ive seen it often enough.",
    "They begin to dream of an\nideal world.",
    "Freedom and brotherhood and poolallsecrets and\nwork for the good of humanity Thats exactly the moment when\nsomeone whos more or less the dregs of humanity sees his\nchance and takes it He rubbed his nose.",
    "Nobodys so gullible as\nthe scientist he said.",
    "All the phony mediums say so.",
    "Cant quite\nsee why.",
    "The other smiled a very tired smile.",
    "Oh yes he said it would be so.",
    "They think they know you see.",
    "Thats always dangerous.",
    "Now our kind are different.",
    "Were\nhumble minded men.",
    "We dont expect to save the world only pick\nup one or two broken pieces and remove a monkey wrench or two\nwhen its jamming up the works.",
    "He tapped thoughtfully on the\ntable with his finger.",
    "If I only knew a little more about Betterton\nhe said.",
    "Not his life and actions but the revealing everyday\nthings.",
    "What sort of jokes he laughed at.",
    "What made him swear.",
    "Who were the people he admired and who made him mad.",
    "Wharton looked at him curiously.",
    "What about the wife  youve tried her\n\nSeveral times.",
    "Cant she help\n\nThe other shrugged his shoulders.",
    "She hasnt so far.",
    "You think she knows something\n\nShe doesnt admit of course that she knows anything.",
    "All the\nestablished reactions worry grief desperate anxiety no cue or\nsuspicion beforehand husbands life perfectly normal no stress of\nany kind  and so on and so on.",
    "Her own theory is that hes been\nkidnapped.",
    "And you dont believe her\n\nIm handicapped said the man behind the desk bitterly.",
    "I never\nbelieve anybody.",
    "Well said Wharton slowly I suppose one has to keep an open\nmind.",
    "Whats she like\n\nOrdinary sort of woman youd meet any day playing bridge.",
    "Wharton nodded comprehendingly.",
    "That makes it more difficult he said.",
    "Shes here to see me now.",
    "We shall go over all the same ground\nagain.",
    "Its the only way said Wharton.",
    "I couldnt do it though.",
    "Havent\ngot the patience.",
    "He got up.",
    "Well I wont keep you.",
    "Weve not got\nmuch further have we.",
    "Unfortunately no.",
    "You might do a special check up on that Oslo\nreport.",
    "Its a likely spot.",
    "Wharton nodded and went out.",
    "The other man raised the receiver\nby his elbow and said\n\nIll see Mrs. Betterton now.",
    "Send her in.",
    "He sat staring into space until there was a tap on the door and Mrs.\nBetterton was shown in.",
    "She was a tall woman about twentyseven\nyears of age.",
    "The most noticeable thing about her was a most\nmagnificent head of auburn red hair.",
    "Beneath the splendour of this\nher face seemed almost insignificant.",
    "She had the blue eyes and\nlight eyelashes that so often go with red hair.",
    "She was wearing no\nmakeup he noticed.",
    "He considered the significance of that while\nhe was greeting her settling her comfortably in a chair near the\ndesk.",
    "It inclined him very slightly to the belief that Mrs. Betterton\nknew more than she had said she knew.",
    "In his experience women suffering from violent grief and anxiety\ndid not neglect their makeup.",
    "Aware of the ravages grief made in\ntheir appearance they did their best to repair those ravages.",
    "He\nwondered if Mrs. Betterton calculatingly abstained from makeup\nthe better to sustain the part of the distracted wife.",
    "She said now\nrather breathlessly\n\nOh Mr. Jessop I do hope  is there any news\n\nHe shook his head and said gently\n\nIm so sorry to ask you to come up like this Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Im\nafraid we havent got any definite news for you.",
    "Olive Betterton said quickly\n\nI know.",
    "You said so in your letter.",
    "But I wondered if  since then oh I was glad to come up.",
    "Just sitting at home wondering and\n\n\fbrooding  thats the worst of it all.",
    "Because theres nothing one can\ndo\n\nThe man called Jessop said soothingly\n\nYou mustnt mind Mrs. Betterton if I go over the same ground\nagain and again ask you the same questions stress the same\npoints.",
    "You see its always possible that some small point might\narise.",
    "Something that you hadnt thought of before or perhaps\nhadnt thought worth mentioning.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I understand.",
    "Ask me all over again about everything.",
    "The last time you saw your husband was on the 23rd of August\n\nYes.",
    "That was when he left England to go to Paris to a Conference\nthere.",
    "Yes.",
    "Jessop went on rapidly\n\nHe attended the first two days of the Conference.",
    "The third day he\ndid not turn up.",
    "Apparently he had mentioned to one of his\ncolleagues that he was going instead for a trip on a bateau mouche\nthat day.",
    "A bateau mouche Whats a bateau mouche\n\n\fJessop smiled.",
    "One of those small boats that go along the Seine.",
    "He looked at her sharply.",
    "Does that strike you as unlike your\nhusband\n\nShe said doubtfully\n\nIt does rather.",
    "I should have thought hed be so keen on what was\ngoing on at the Conference.",
    "Possibly.",
    "Still the subject for discussion on this particular day was\nnot one in which he had any special interest so he might\nreasonably have given himself a day off.",
    "But it doesnt strike you as\nbeing quite like your husband\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "He did not return that evening to his hotel went on Jessop.",
    "As\nfar as can be ascertained he did not pass any frontier certainly not\non his own passport.",
    "Do you think he could have had a second\npassport in another name perhaps\n\nOh no why should he\n\nHe watched her.",
    "You never saw such a thing in his possession\n\n\fShe shook her head with vehemence.",
    "No and I dont believe it.",
    "I dont believe it for a moment.",
    "I dont\nbelieve he went away deliberately as you all try to make out.",
    "Somethings happened to him or else  or else perhaps hes lost his\nmemory.",
    "His health had been quite normal\n\nYes.",
    "He was working rather hard and sometimes felt a little tired\nnothing more than that.",
    "Hed not seemed worried in any way or depressed\n\nHe wasnt worried or depressed about anything With shaking\nfingers she opened her bag and took out her handkerchief.",
    "Its all\nso awful.",
    "Her voice shook.",
    "I cant believe it.",
    "Hed never have gone\noff without a word to me.",
    "Somethings happened to him.",
    "Hes been\nkidnapped or hes been attacked perhaps.",
    "I try not to think it but\nsometimes I feel that that must be the solution.",
    "He must be dead.",
    "Now please Mrs. Betterton please  theres no need to entertain\nthat supposition yet.",
    "If hes dead his body would have been\ndiscovered by now.",
    "It might not.",
    "Awful things happen.",
    "He might have been drowned or\npushed down a sewer.",
    "Im sure anything could happen in Paris.",
    "Paris I can assure you Mrs. Betterton is a very well policed city.",
    "She took the handkerchief away from her eyes and stared at him\nwith sharp anger.",
    "I know what you think but it isnt so Tom wouldnt sell secrets or\nbetray secrets.",
    "He wasnt a communist.",
    "His whole life is an open\nbook.",
    "What were his political beliefs Mrs. Betterton\n\nIn America he was a Democrat I believe.",
    "Here he voted Labour.",
    "He wasnt interested in politics.",
    "He was a scientist first and last.",
    "She added defiantly He was a brilliant scientist.",
    "Yes said Jessop he was a brilliant scientist.",
    "Thats really the\ncrux of the whole matter.",
    "He might have been offered you know\nvery considerable inducements to leave this country and go\nelsewhere.",
    "Its not true.",
    "Anger leapt out again.",
    "Thats what the papers try to\nmake out.",
    "Thats what you all think when you come questioning me.",
    "Its not true.",
    "Hed never go without telling me without giving me\nsome idea.",
    "And he told you  nothing\n\nAgain he was watching her keenly.",
    "Nothing.",
    "I dont know where he is.",
    "I think he was kidnapped or\nelse as I say dead.",
    "But if hes dead I must know.",
    "I must know\n\n\fsoon.",
    "I cant go on like this waiting and wondering.",
    "I cant eat or\nsleep.",
    "Im sick and ill with worry.",
    "Cant you help me Cant you help\nme at all\n\nHe got up then and moved round his desk.",
    "He murmured\n\nIm so very sorry Mrs. Betterton so very sorry.",
    "Let me assure you\nthat we are trying our very best to find out what has happened to\nyour husband.",
    "We get reports in every day from various places.",
    "Reports from where she asked sharply.",
    "What do they say\n\nHe shook his head.",
    "They all have to be followed up sifted and tested.",
    "But as a rule I\nam afraid theyre vague in the extreme.",
    "I must know she murmured brokenly again.",
    "I cant go on like\nthis.",
    "Do you care for your husband very much Mrs. Betterton\n\nOf course I care for him.",
    "Why weve only been married six months.",
    "Only six months.",
    "Yes I know.",
    "There was  forgive me for asking  no quarrel of any\nkind between you\n\nOh no\n\n\fNo trouble over  any other woman\n\nOf course not.",
    "Ive told you.",
    "We were only married last April.",
    "Please believe that Im not suggesting such a thing is likely but\none has to take every possibility into account that might allow for\nhis going off in this way.",
    "You say he had not been upset lately or\nworried  not on edge  not nervy in any way\n\nNo no no\n\nPeople do get nervy you know Mrs. Betterton in such a job as\nyour husband had.",
    "Living under exacting security conditions.",
    "In\nfact  he smiled  its almost normal to be nervy.",
    "She did not smile back.",
    "He was just as usual she said stolidly.",
    "Happy about his work Did he discuss it at all with you\n\nNo it was all so technical.",
    "You dont think he had any qualms over its  destructive\npossibilities shall I say Scientists do feel that sometimes.",
    "He never said anything of the kind.",
    "You see Mrs. Betterton he leaned forward over the desk\ndropping some of his impassiveness what I am trying to do is to\n\n\fget a picture of your husband.",
    "The sort of man he was.",
    "And\nsomehow youre not helping me.",
    "But what more can I say or do Ive answered all your questions.",
    "Yes youve answered my questions mostly in the negative.",
    "I want\nsomething positive something constructive.",
    "Do you see what I\nmean You can look for a man so much better when you know what\nkind of a man he is.",
    "She reflected for a moment.",
    "I see.",
    "At least I suppose I see.",
    "Well\nTom was cheerful and goodtempered.",
    "And clever of course.",
    "Jessop smiled.",
    "Thats a list of qualities.",
    "Lets try and get more personal.",
    "Did he\nread much\n\nYes a fair amount.",
    "What sort of books\n\nOh biographies.",
    "Book Society recommendations crime stories if\nhe was tired.",
    "Rather a conventional reader in fact.",
    "No special preferences Did\nhe play cards or chess\n\nHe played bridge.",
    "We used to play with Dr. Evans and his wife\nonce or twice a week.",
    "Did your husband have many friends\n\nOh yes he was a good mixer.",
    "I didnt mean just that.",
    "I mean was he a man who  cared very much\nfor his friends\n\nHe played golf with one or two of our neighbours.",
    "No special friends or cronies of his own\n\nNo.",
    "You see hed been in the U.S.A. for so long and he was born\nin Canada.",
    "He didnt know many people over here.",
    "Jessop consulted a scrap of paper at his elbow.",
    "Three people visited him recently from the States I understand.",
    "I\nhave their names here.",
    "As far as we can discover these three were\nthe only people with whom he recently made contact from outside\nso to speak.",
    "Thats why weve given them special attention.",
    "Now\nfirst Walter Griffiths.",
    "He came to see you at Harwell.",
    "Yes he was over in England on a visit and he came to look up\nTom.",
    "And your husbands reactions\n\nTom was surprised to see him but very pleased.",
    "Theyd known\neach other quite well in the States.",
    "What did this Griffiths seem like to you Just describe him in your\nown way.",
    "But surely you know all about him\n\nYes we know all about him.",
    "But I want to hear what you thought of\nhim.",
    "She reflected for a moment.",
    "Well he was solemn and rather longwinded.",
    "Very polite to me and\nseemed very fond of Tom and anxious to tell him about things that\nhad happened after Tom had come to England.",
    "All local gossip I\nsuppose.",
    "It wasnt very interesting to me because I didnt know any\nof the people.",
    "Anyway I was getting dinner ready while they were\nreminiscing.",
    "No question of politics came up\n\nYoure trying to hint that he was a communist.",
    "Olive Bettertons\nface flushed.",
    "Im sure he was nothing of the sort.",
    "He had some\ngovernment job  in the District Attorneys office I think.",
    "And\nanyway when Tom said something laughing about witch hunts in\nAmerica he said solemnly that we didnt understand over here.",
    "They were necessary.",
    "So that shows he wasnt a communist\n\nPlease please Mrs. Betterton now dont get upset.",
    "Tom wasnt a communist I keep telling you so and you dont\nbelieve me.",
    "Yes I do but the point is bound to come up.",
    "Now for the second\ncontact from abroad Dr. Mark Lucas.",
    "You ran across him in London\nin the Dorset.",
    "Yes.",
    "Wed gone up to do a show and we were having supper at the\nDorset afterwards.",
    "Suddenly this man Luke or Lucas came along\nand greeted Tom.",
    "He was a research chemist of some kind and the\nlast time he had seen Tom was in the States.",
    "He was a German\nrefugee whod taken American nationality.",
    "But surely you...",
    "But surely I know that Yes I do Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Was your\nhusband surprised to see him\n\nYes very surprised.",
    "Pleased\n\nYes yes  I think so \n\nBut youre not sure He pressed her.",
    "Well he was a man Tom didnt much care about or so he told me\nafterwards thats all.",
    "It was just a casual meeting There was no arrangement made to\nmeet at some future date\n\n\fNo it was just a casual encounter.",
    "I see.",
    "The third contact from abroad was a woman Mrs. Carol\nSpeeder also from the States.",
    "How did that come about\n\nShe was something to do with UNO I believe.",
    "Shed known Tom in\nAmerica and she rang him up from London to say she was over\nhere and asked if we could come up and lunch one day.",
    "And did you\n\nNo.",
    "You didnt but your husband did\n\nWhat She stared.",
    "He didnt tell you\n\nNo.",
    "Olive\n\nBetterton\n\nlooked\n\nbewildered\n\nand\n\nuneasy.",
    "The\n\nman\n\nquestioning her felt a little sorry for her but he did not relent.",
    "For\nthe first time he thought he might be getting somewhere.",
    "I dont understand it she said uncertainly.",
    "It seems very odd he\nshouldnt have said anything about it to me.",
    "They lunched together at the Dorset where Mrs. Speeder was\nstaying on Wednesday August 12th.",
    "August 12th\n\nYes.",
    "Yes he did go to London about then...",
    "He never said anything \nshe broke off again and then shot out a question.",
    "What is she\nlike\n\nHe answered quickly and reassuringly.",
    "Not at all a glamorous type Mrs. Betterton.",
    "A competent young\ncareer woman of thirtyodd not particularly goodlooking.",
    "Theres\nabsolutely no suggestion of her ever having been on intimate terms\nwith your husband.",
    "That is just why its odd that he didnt tell you\nabout the meeting.",
    "Yes yes I see that.",
    "Now think carefully Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Did you notice any change in\nyour husband about that time About the middle of August shall we\nsay That would be about a week before the conference.",
    "No  No I noticed nothing.",
    "There was nothing to notice.",
    "Jessop sighed.",
    "The instrument on his desk buzzed discreetly.",
    "He picked up the\nreceiver.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "The voice at the other end said\n\nTheres a man whos asking to see someone in authority about the\nBetterton case sir.",
    "Whats his name\n\nThe voice at the other end coughed discreetly.",
    "Well Im not exactly sure how you pronounce it Mr. Jessop.",
    "Perhaps Id better spell it.",
    "Right.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "He jotted down on his blotter the letters as they came over the wire.",
    "Polish he said interrogatively at the end.",
    "He didnt say sir.",
    "He speaks English quite well but with a bit of an\naccent\n\nAsk him to wait.",
    "Very good sir.",
    "Jessop replaced the telephone.",
    "Then he looked across at Olive\nBetterton.",
    "She sat there quite quietly with a disarming hopeless\nplacidity.",
    "He tore off the leaf on his desk pad with the name he had\njust written on it and shoved it across to her.",
    "Know anybody of that name he asked.",
    "Her eyes widened as she looked at it.",
    "For a moment he thought she\nlooked frightened.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "Yes I do.",
    "He wrote to me.",
    "When\n\nYesterday.",
    "Hes a cousin of Toms first wife.",
    "Hes just arrived in\nthis country.",
    "He was very concerned about Toms disappearance.",
    "He wrote to ask if I had had any news and  and to give me his most\nprofound sympathy.",
    "Youd never heard of him before that\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "Ever hear your husband speak of him\n\nNo.",
    "So really he mightnt be your husbands cousin at all\n\nWell no I suppose not.",
    "I never thought of that.",
    "She looked\nstartled.",
    "But Toms first wife was a foreigner.",
    "She was Professor\nMannheims daughter.",
    "This man seemed to know all about her and\nTom in his letter.",
    "It was very correct and formal and  and foreign\nyou know.",
    "It seemed quite genuine.",
    "And anyway what would be the\npoint  if he werent genuine I mean\n\n\fAh thats what one always asks oneself.",
    "Jessop smiled faintly.",
    "We do it so much here that we begin to see the smallest thing quite\nout of proportion\n\nYes I should think you might.",
    "She shivered suddenly.",
    "Its like this\nroom of yours in the middle of a labyrinth of corridors just like a\ndream when you think you will never get out...",
    "Yes yes I can see it might have a claustrophobic effect said\nJessop pleasantly.",
    "Olive Betterton put a hand up and pushed back her hair from her\nforehead.",
    "I cant stand it much longer you know she said.",
    "Just sitting and\nwaiting.",
    "I want to get away somewhere for a change.",
    "Abroad for\nchoice.",
    "Somewhere where reporters wont ring me up all the time\nand people stare at me.",
    "Im always meeting friends and they keep\nasking if I have had any news She paused then went on I think I think Im going to break down.",
    "Ive tried to be brave but its too\nmuch for me.",
    "My doctor agrees.",
    "He says I ought to go right away\nsomewhere for three or four weeks.",
    "He wrote me a letter.",
    "Ill show\nyou.",
    "She fumbled in her bag took out an envelope and pushed it across\nthe desk to Jessop.",
    "Youll see what he says.",
    "Jessop took the letter out of the envelope and read it.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Yes I see.",
    "He put the letter back in the envelope.",
    "So  so it would be all right for me to go Her eyes watched him\nnervously.",
    "But of course Mrs. Betterton he replied.",
    "He raised surprised\neyebrows.",
    "Why not\n\nI thought you might object.",
    "Object  why Its entirely your own business.",
    "Youll arrange it so\nthat I can get in touch with you while youre away in case any news\nshould come through.",
    "Oh of course.",
    "Where were you thinking of going\n\nSomewhere where there is sun and not too many English people.",
    "Spain or Morocco.",
    "Very nice.",
    "Do you a lot of good Im sure.",
    "Oh thank you.",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "She rose excited elated  her nervousness still apparent.",
    "Jessop rose shook hands with her pressed the buzzer for a\nmessenger to see her out.",
    "He went back to his chair and sat down.",
    "For a few moments his face remained as expressionless as before\nthen very slowly he smiled.",
    "He lifted the phone.",
    "Ill see Major Glydr now he said.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nMajor Glydr Jessop hesitated a little over the name.",
    "It is difficult yes.",
    "The visitor spoke with humorous appreciation.",
    "Your compatriots they have called me Glider in the war.",
    "And now\nin the States I shall change my name to Glyn which is more\nconvenient for all.",
    "You come from the States now\n\nYes I arrived a week ago.",
    "You are  excuse me  Mr. Jessop\n\nIm Jessop.",
    "The other looked at him with interest.",
    "So he said.",
    "I have heard of you.",
    "Indeed From whom\n\n\fThe other smiled.",
    "Perhaps we go too fast.",
    "Before you permit that I should ask you\nsome questions I present you first this letter from the U.S.\nEmbassy.",
    "He passed it with a bow.",
    "Jessop took it read the few lines of polite\nintroduction put it down.",
    "He looked appraisingly at his visitor.",
    "A tall\nman carrying himself rather stiffly aged thirty or thereabouts.",
    "The\nfair hair was close cropped in the continental fashion.",
    "The\nstrangers speech was slow and careful with a very definite foreign\nintonation though grammatically correct.",
    "He was Jessop noticed\nnot at all nervous or unsure of himself.",
    "That in itself was unusual.",
    "Most of the people who came into this office were nervous or\nexcited or apprehensive.",
    "Sometimes they were shifty sometimes\nvehement.",
    "This was a man who had complete command of himself a man with\na poker face who knew what he was doing and why and who would\nnot be easily tricked or betrayed into saying more than he meant to\nsay.",
    "Jessop said pleasantly And what can we do for you\n\nI came to ask if you had any further news of Thomas Betterton\nwho disappeared recently in what seems a somewhat sensational\nmanner.",
    "One cannot I know believe exactly what one reads in the\npress so I ask where I can go for reliable information.",
    "They tell me you.",
    "Im sorry weve no definite information about Betterton.",
    "I thought perhaps he might have been sent abroad on some\nmission.",
    "He paused and added rather quaintly You know hushhush.",
    "My dear sir.",
    "Jessop looked pained.",
    "Betterton was a scientist not\na diplomat or a secret agent.",
    "I am rebuked.",
    "But labels are not always correct.",
    "You will want to\ninquire my interest in the matter.",
    "Thomas Betterton was a relation\nof mine by marriage.",
    "Yes.",
    "You are the nephew I believe of the late Professor\nMannheim.",
    "Ah that you knew already.",
    "You are well informed here.",
    "People come along and tell us things murmured Jessop.",
    "Bettertons wife was here.",
    "She told me.",
    "You had written to her.",
    "Yes to express my condolences and to ask if she had had any\nfurther news.",
    "That was very correct.",
    "My mother was Professor Mannheims only sister.",
    "They were much\nattached.",
    "In Warsaw when I was a child I was much at my uncles\nhouse and his daughter Elsa was to me like a sister.",
    "When my\nfather and mother died my home was with my uncle and cousin.",
    "They were happy days.",
    "Then came the war the tragedies the\n\n\fhorrors... Of all that we will not speak.",
    "My uncle and Elsa escaped\nto America.",
    "I myself remained in the underground Resistance and\nafter the war ended I had certain assignments.",
    "One visit I paid to\nAmerica to see my uncle and cousin that was all.",
    "But there came a\ntime when my commitments in Europe are ended.",
    "I intend to reside\nin the States permanently.",
    "I shall be I hope near my uncle and my\ncousin and her husband.",
    "But alas  he spread out his hands  I get\nthere and my uncle he is dead my cousin too and her husband he\nhas come to this country and has married again.",
    "So once more I\nhave no family.",
    "And then I read of the disappearance of the wellknown scientist Thomas Betterton and I come over to see what can\nbe done.",
    "He paused and looked enquiringly at Jessop.",
    "Jessop looked expressionlessly back at him.",
    "Why did he disappear Mr. Jessop\n\nThat said Jessop pleasantly is just what wed like to know.",
    "Perhaps you do know\n\nJessop appreciated with some interest how easily their roles might\nbecome reversed.",
    "In this room he was accustomed to ask\nquestions of people.",
    "This stranger was not the inquisitor.",
    "Still\nsmiling pleasantly Jessop replied\n\nI assure you we do not.",
    "But you suspect\n\n\fIt is possible said Jessop cautiously that the thing follows a\ncertain pattern...",
    "There have been occurrences of this kind before.",
    "I know.",
    "Rapidly the visitor cited a half dozen cases.",
    "All\nscientists he said with significance.",
    "Yes.",
    "They have gone beyond the Iron Curtain\n\nIt is a possibility but we do not know.",
    "But they have gone of their own free will\n\nEven that said Jessop is difficult to say.",
    "It is not my business you think\n\nOh please.",
    "But you are right.",
    "It is of interest to me only because of Betterton.",
    "Youll forgive me said Jessop if I dont quite understand your\ninterest.",
    "After all Betterton is only a relation by marriage.",
    "You\ndidnt even know him.",
    "That is true.",
    "But for us Poles the family is very important.",
    "There\nare obligations.",
    "He stood up and bowed stiffly.",
    "I regret that I have\ntrespassed upon your time and I thank you for your courtesy.",
    "Jessop rose also.",
    "Im sorry we cannot help you he said but I assure you we are\ncompletely in the dark.",
    "If I do hear of anything can I reach you\n\nCare of the U.S. Embassy will find me.",
    "I thank you.",
    "Again he\nbowed formally.",
    "Jessop touched the buzzer.",
    "Major Glydr went out.",
    "Jessop lifted the\nreceiver.",
    "Ask Colonel Wharton to come to my room.",
    "When Wharton entered the room Jessop said\n\nThings are moving  at last.",
    "How\n\nMrs. Betterton wants to go abroad.",
    "Wharton whistled.",
    "Going to join hubby\n\nIm hopeful.",
    "She came provided with a convenient letter from her\nmedical adviser.",
    "Complete need of rest and change of scene.",
    "Looks good\n\n\fThough of course it may be true Jessop warned him.",
    "A simple\nstatement of fact.",
    "We never take that view here said Wharton.",
    "No.",
    "I must say she does her stuff very convincingly.",
    "Never slips up\nfor a moment.",
    "You got nothing further from her I suppose\n\nOne faint lead.",
    "The Speeder woman with whom Betterton lunched\nat the Dorset.",
    "Yes\n\nHe didnt tell his wife about the lunch.",
    "Oh.",
    "Wharton considered.",
    "You think thats relevant\n\nIt might be.",
    "Carol Speeder was had up before the Committee for\nthe investigation of unAmerican Activities.",
    "She cleared herself but\nall the same... yes all the same she was or they thought she was\ntarred with that brush.",
    "It may be a possible contact.",
    "The only one\nweve found for Betterton so far.",
    "What about Mrs. Bettertons contacts  any possible contact lately\nwho could have instigated the going abroad business\n\n\fNo personal contact.",
    "She had a letter yesterday from a Pole.",
    "A\ncousin of Bettertons first wife.",
    "I had him here just now asking for\ndetails etc.",
    "Whats he like\n\nNot real said Jessop.",
    "All very foreign and correct got all the\ngen curiously unreal as a personality.",
    "Think hes been the contact to tip her off\n\nIt could be.",
    "I dont know.",
    "He puzzles me.",
    "Going to keep tabs on him\n\nJessop smiled.",
    "Yes.",
    "I pressed the buzzer twice.",
    "You old spider  with your tricks.",
    "Wharton became businesslike\nagain.",
    "Well whats the form\n\nJanet I think and the usual.",
    "Spain or Morocco.",
    "Not Switzerland\n\nNot this time.",
    "I should have thought Spain or Morocco would have been difficult\nfor them.",
    "We mustnt underestimate our adversaries.",
    "Wharton flipped the security files disgustedly with his nail.",
    "About the only two countries where Betterton hasnt been seen\nhe said with chagrin.",
    "Well well lay it all on.",
    "My God if we fall down\non the job this time \n\nJessop leaned back in his chair.",
    "Its a long time since Ive had a holiday he said.",
    "Im rather sick of\nthis office.",
    "I might take a little trip abroad...\n\nChapter 3\n\nFlight 108 to Paris.",
    "Air France.",
    "This way please.",
    "The persons in the lounge at Heathrow Airport rose to their feet.",
    "Hilary Craven picked up her small lizard skin travelling case and\nmoved in the wake of the others out on to the tarmac.",
    "The wind\nblew sharply cold after the heated air of the lounge.",
    "Hilary shivered and drew her furs a little closer round her.",
    "She\nfollowed the other passengers across to where the aircraft was\nwaiting.",
    "This was it She was off  escaping Out of the greyness\nthe coldness the dead numb misery.",
    "Escaping to sunshine and\nblue skies and a new life.",
    "She would leave all this weight behind\n\n\fthis dead weight of misery and frustration.",
    "She went up the\ngangway of her plane bending her head as she passed inside and\nwas shown by the steward to her seat.",
    "For the first time in months\nshe savoured relief from a pain that had been so sharply acute as\nalmost to be physical.",
    "I shall get away she said to herself\nhopefully.",
    "I shall get away.",
    "The roaring and the revolutions of the plane excited her.",
    "There\nseemed a kind of elemental savagery in it.",
    "Civilized misery she\nthought is the worst misery.",
    "Grey and hopeless.",
    "But now she\nthought I shall escape.",
    "The plane taxied gently along the runway.",
    "The air hostess said\n\nFasten your belts please.",
    "The plane made a half turn and stood waiting its signal to depart.",
    "Hilary thought Perhaps the plane will crash... Perhaps it will never\nrise off the ground.",
    "Then that will be the end that will be the\nsolution to everything.",
    "They seemed to wait for ages out on the\nairfield.",
    "Waiting for the signal to start off to freedom Hilary thought\nabsurdly I shall never get away never.",
    "I shall be kept here  a\nprisoner...\n\nAh at last.",
    "A final roar of engines then the plane started forward.",
    "Quicker\nquicker racing along.",
    "Hilary thought It wont rise.",
    "It cant...",
    "This is\nthe end.",
    "Ah they were above the ground now it seemed.",
    "Not so\nmuch that the plane rose as that the earth was falling away\n\n\fdropping down thrusting its problems and its disappointments and\nits frustrations beneath the soaring creature rising up so proudly\ninto the clouds.",
    "Up they went circling round the aerodrome\nlooking like a ridiculous childs toy beneath.",
    "Funny little roads\nstrange little railways with toy trains on them.",
    "A ridiculous childish\nworld where people loved and hated and broke their hearts.",
    "None\nof it mattered because they were all so ridiculous and so pettily\nsmall and unimportant.",
    "Now there were clouds below them a\ndense greyishwhite mass.",
    "They must be over the Channel now.",
    "Hilary leaned back closing her eyes.",
    "Escape.",
    "Escape.",
    "She had left\nEngland left Nigel left the sad little mound that was Brendas\ngrave.",
    "All left behind.",
    "She opened her eyes closed them again with\na long sigh.",
    "She slept...\n\nII\n\nWhen Hilary awoke the plane was coming down.",
    "Paris thought Hilary as she sat up in her seat and reached for\nher handbag.",
    "But it was not Paris.",
    "The air hostess came down the\ncar saying with that nursery governess brightness that some\ntravellers found so annoying\n\nWe are landing you at Beauvais as the fog is very thick in Paris.",
    "The suggestion in her manner was Wont that be nice children\nHilary peered down through the small space of window at her side.",
    "She could see little.",
    "Beauvais also appeared to be wreathed in fog.",
    "The plane was circling round slowly.",
    "It was some time before it\nfinally made its landing.",
    "Then the passengers were marshalled\nthrough cold damp mist into a rough wooden building with a few\nchairs and a long wooden counter.",
    "Depression settled down on Hilary but she tried to fight it off.",
    "A man\nnear her murmured\n\nAn old war aerodrome.",
    "No heating or comforts here.",
    "Still\nfortunately being the French theyll serve us out some drinks.",
    "True enough almost immediately a man came along with some\nkeys and presently passengers were being served with various\nforms of alcoholic refreshment to boost their morale.",
    "It helped to\nbuoy the passengers up for the long and irritating wait.",
    "Some hours passed before anything happened.",
    "Other planes\nappeared out of the fog and landed also diverted from Paris.",
    "Soon\nthe small room was crowded with cold irritable people grumbling\nabout the delay.",
    "To Hilary it all had an unreal quality.",
    "It was as though she was still in\na dream mercifully protected from contact with reality.",
    "This was\nonly a delay only a matter of waiting.",
    "She was still on her journey her journey of escape.",
    "She was still getting away from it all still\ngoing towards that spot where her life would start again.",
    "Her mood\nheld.",
    "Held through the long fatiguing delay held through the\nmoments of chaos when it was announced long after dark that\nbuses had come to convey the travellers to Paris.",
    "There was then a wild confusion of coming and going passengers\nofficials porters all carrying baggage hurrying and colliding in the\ndarkness.",
    "In the end Hilary found herself her feet and legs icy cold\nin a bus slowly rumbling its way through the fog towards Paris.",
    "It was a long weary drive taking four hours.",
    "It was midnight when\nthey arrived at the Invalides and Hilary was thankful to collect her\nbaggage and drive to the hotel where accommodation was\nreserved for her.",
    "She was too tired to eat  just had a hot bath and\ntumbled into bed.",
    "The plane to Casablanca was due to leave Orly Airport at ten thirty\nthe following morning but when they arrived at Orly everything was\nconfusion.",
    "Planes had been grounded in many parts of Europe\narrivals had been delayed as well as departures.",
    "A harassed clerk at the departure desk shrugged his shoulders and\nsaid\n\nImpossible for Madame to go on the flight where she had\nreservations The schedules have all had to be changed.",
    "If Madame\nwill take a seat for a little minute presumably all will arrange itself.",
    "In the end she was summoned and told that there was a place on a\nplane going to Dakar which normally did not touch down at\nCasablanca but would do so on this occasion.",
    "You will arrive three hours later that is all Madame on this later\nservice.",
    "Hilary acquiesced without protest and the official seemed\nsurprised and positively delighted by her attitude.",
    "Madame has no conceptions of the difficulties that have been\nmade to me this morning he said.",
    "Enfin they are unreasonable\nMessieurs the travellers.",
    "It is not I who made the fog Naturally it\nhas caused the disruptions.",
    "One must accommodate oneself with\nthe good humour  that is what I say however displeasing it is to\nhave ones plans altered.",
    "Apres tout Madame a little delay of an\nhour or two hours or three hours what does it matter How can it\nmatter by what plane one arrives at Casablanca.",
    "Yet on that particular day it mattered more than the little\nFrenchman knew when he spoke those words.",
    "For when Hilary\nfinally arrived and stepped out into the sunshine on to the tarmac\nthe porter who was moving beside her with his piledup trolley of\nluggage observed\n\nYou have the lucky chance Madame not to have been on the\nplane before this the regular plane for Casablanca.",
    "Hilary said Why what happened\n\nThe man looked uneasily to and fro but after all the news could not\nbe kept secret.",
    "He lowered his voice confidentially and leant\ntowards her.",
    "Mauvaise affaire he muttered.",
    "It crashed  landing.",
    "The pilot and\nthe navigator are dead and most of the passengers.",
    "Four or five\n\n\fwere alive and have been taken to hospital.",
    "Some of those are\nbadly hurt.",
    "Hilarys first reaction was a kind of blinding anger.",
    "Almost\nunprompted there leapt into her mind the thought Why wasnt I in\nthat plane If I had been it would have been all over now  I should\nbe dead out of it all.",
    "No more heartaches no more misery.",
    "The\npeople in that plane wanted to live.",
    "And I  I dont care.",
    "Why\nshouldnt it have been me\n\nShe passed through the Customs a perfunctory affair and drove\nwith her baggage to the hotel.",
    "It was a glorious sunlit afternoon\nwith the sun just sinking to rest.",
    "The clear air and golden light  it\nwas all as she had pictured it.",
    "She had arrived She had left the fog\nthe cold the darkness of London she had left behind her misery\nand indecision and suffering.",
    "Here there was pulsating life and\ncolour and sunshine.",
    "She crossed her bedroom and threw open the shutters looking out\ninto the street.",
    "Yes it was all as she had pictured it would be.",
    "Hilary\nturned slowly away from the window and sat down on the side of\nthe bed.",
    "Escape escape That was the refrain that had hummed\nincessantly in her mind ever since she left England.",
    "Escape.",
    "Escape.",
    "And now she knew  knew with a horrible stricken\ncoldness that there was no escape.",
    "Everything was just the same here as it had been in London.",
    "She\nherself Hilary Craven was the same.",
    "It was from Hilary Craven that\nshe was trying to escape and Hilary Craven was Hilary Craven in\n\n\fMorocco just as much as she had been Hilary Craven in London.",
    "She said very softly to herself\n\nWhat a fool Ive been  what a fool I am.",
    "Why did I think that Id feel\ndifferently if I got away from England\n\nBrendas grave that small pathetic mound was in England and\nNigel would shortly be marrying his new wife in England.",
    "Why had\nshe imagined that those two things would matter less to her here\nWishful thinking that was all.",
    "Well that was all over now.",
    "She was\nup against reality.",
    "The reality of herself and what she could bear\nand what she could not bear.",
    "One could bear things Hilary thought\nso long as there was a reason for bearing them.",
    "She had borne her\nown long illness she had borne Nigels defection and the cruel and\nbrutal circumstances in which it had operated.",
    "She had borne\nthese things because there was Brenda.",
    "Then had come the long\nslow losing fight for Brendas life  the final defeat... Now there was\nnothing to live for any longer.",
    "It had taken the journey to Morocco to\nprove that to her.",
    "In London she had had a queer confused feeling\nthat if only she could get somewhere else she could forget what lay\nbehind her and start again.",
    "And so she had booked her journey to\nthis place which had no associations with the past a place quite\nnew to her which had the qualities she loved to much sunlight pure\nair and the strangeness of new people and things.",
    "Here she had\nthought things will be different.",
    "But they were not different.",
    "They\nwere the same.",
    "The facts were quite simple and inescapable.",
    "She\nHilary Craven had no longer any wish to go on living.",
    "It was as\nsimple as that.",
    "If the fog had not intervened if she had travelled on the plane on\nwhich her reservations had been made then her problem might\nhave been solved by now.",
    "She might be lying now in some French\nofficial mortuary a body broken and battered with her spirit at\npeace freed from suffering.",
    "Well the same end could be achieved\nbut she would have to take a little trouble.",
    "It would have been so easy if she had had sleeping stuff with her.",
    "She remembered how she had asked Dr. Grey and the rather queer\nlook on his face as he had answered\n\nBetter not.",
    "Much better to learn to sleep naturally.",
    "May be hard at\nfirst but it will come.",
    "A queer look on his face.",
    "Had he known then or suspected that it\nwould come to this Oh well it should not be difficult.",
    "She rose to\nher feet with decision.",
    "She would go out now to a chemists shop.",
    "III\n\nHilary had always imagined that drugs were easy to buy in foreign\ncities.",
    "Rather to her surprise she found that this was not so.",
    "The\nchemist she went to first supplied her with only two doses.",
    "For\nmore than that amount he said a doctors prescription would be\nadvisable.",
    "She thanked him smilingly and nonchalantly and went\nrather quickly out of the shop colliding as she did so with a tall\nrather solemnfaced young man who apologised in English.",
    "She\nheard him asking for toothpaste as she left the shop.",
    "Somehow that amused her.",
    "Toothpaste.",
    "It seemed so ridiculous so\nnormal so everyday.",
    "Then a sharp pang pierced her for the\ntoothpaste he had asked for was the brand that Nigel had always\npreferred.",
    "She crossed the street and went into a shop opposite.",
    "She had been to four chemists shops by the time she returned to\nthe hotel.",
    "It had amused her a little that in the third shop the owlish\nyoung man had again appeared once more asking obstinately for\nhis particular brand of toothpaste which evidently was not one\ncommonly stocked by French chemists in Casablanca.",
    "Hilary felt almost lighthearted as she changed her frock and made\nup her face before going down for dinner.",
    "She purposely went\ndown as late as possible since she was anxious not to encounter\nany of her fellow travellers or the personnel of the aeroplane.",
    "That\nwas hardly likely in any case since the plane had gone on to Dakar\nshe thought that she had been the only person put off at\nCasablanca.",
    "The restaurant was almost empty by the time she came into it\nthough she noticed that the young Englishman with the owllike\nface was just finishing his meal at the table by the wall.",
    "He was\nreading a French newspaper and seemed quite absorbed in it.",
    "Hilary ordered herself a good meal with a half bottle of wine.",
    "She\nwas feeling a heady kind of excitement.",
    "She thought to herself\nWhat is this after all but the last adventure Then she ordered a\nbottle of Vichy water to be sent up to her room and went straight up\nafter leaving the dining room.",
    "The waiter brought the Vichy uncapped it placed it on the table\nand wishing her goodnight left the room.",
    "Hilary drew a sigh of\nrelief.",
    "As he closed the door after him she went to it and turned the\nkey in the lock.",
    "She took from the drawer of the dressing table the\nfour little packets she had obtained from the chemists and\nunwrapped them.",
    "She laid the tablets out on the table and poured\nherself out a glass of Vichy water.",
    "Since the drugs were in tablet\nform she had only to swallow them and wash them down with the\nVichy water.",
    "She undressed wrapped her dressing gown round her and came\nback to sit by the table.",
    "Her heart beat faster.",
    "She felt something\nlike fear now but the fear was half fascination and not the kind of\nflinching that would have tempted her to abandon her plan.",
    "She\nwas quite calm and clear about that.",
    "This was escape at last  real\nescape.",
    "She looked at the writing table debating whether she\nwould leave a note.",
    "She decided against it.",
    "She had no relations no\nclose or dear friends there was nobody to whom she wished to say\ngoodbye.",
    "As for Nigel she had no wish to burden him with useless\nremorse even if a note from her would have achieved that object.",
    "Nigel would read presumably in the paper that a Mrs. Hilary Craven\nhad died of an overdose of sleeping tablets in Casablanca.",
    "It would\nprobably be quite a small paragraph.",
    "He would accept it at its face\nvalue.",
    "Poor old Hilary he would say bad luck  and it might be\nthat secretly he would be rather relieved.",
    "Because she guessed\nthat she was slightly on Nigels conscience and he was a man\nwho wished to feel comfortable with himself.",
    "Already Nigel seemed very far away and curiously unimportant.",
    "There was nothing more to be done.",
    "She would swallow the pills\n\n\fand lie down on her bed and sleep.",
    "From that sleep she would not\nwake.",
    "She had not or thought she had not any religious feeling.",
    "Brendas death had shut down on all that.",
    "So there was nothing\nmore to consider.",
    "She was once again a traveller as she had been\nat Heathrow Airport a traveller waiting to depart for an unknown\ndestination unencumbered by baggage unaffected by farewells.",
    "For the first time in her life she was free entirely free to act as she\nwished to act.",
    "Already the past was cut away from her.",
    "The long\naching misery that had dragged her down in her waking hours was\ngone.",
    "Yes.",
    "Light free unencumbered Ready to start on her\njourney.",
    "She stretched out her hand towards the first tablet.",
    "As she did so\nthere came a soft discreet tap on the door.",
    "Hilary frowned.",
    "She sat\nthere her hand arrested in midair.",
    "Who was it  a chambermaid\nNo the bed had already been turned down.",
    "Somebody perhaps\nabout papers or passport She shrugged her shoulders.",
    "She would\nnot answer the door.",
    "Why should she bother Presently whoever it\nwas would go away and come back at some further opportunity.",
    "The knock came again a little louder this time.",
    "But Hilary did not\nmove.",
    "There could be no real urgency and whoever it was would\nsoon go away.",
    "Her eyes were on the door and suddenly they widened with\nastonishment.",
    "The key was slowly turning backwards round the\nlock.",
    "It jerked forward and fell on the floor with a metallic clang.",
    "Then the handle turned the door opened and a man came in.",
    "She\nrecognised him as the solemn owlish young man who had been\nbuying toothpaste.",
    "Hilary stared at him.",
    "She was too startled for the\n\n\fmoment to say or do anything.",
    "The young man turned round shut\nthe door picked the key up from the floor put it into the lock and\nturned it.",
    "Then he came across towards her and sat down in a chair\nthe other side of the table.",
    "He said and it seemed to her a most\nincongruous remark\n\nMy names Jessop.",
    "The colour rose sharply in Hilarys face.",
    "She leaned forward.",
    "She\nsaid with cold anger\n\nWhat do you think youre doing here may I ask\n\nHe looked at her solemnly  and blinked.",
    "Funny he said.",
    "I came to ask you that.",
    "He gave a quick\nsideways nod towards the preparations on the table.",
    "Hilary said\nsharply\n\nI dont know what you mean.",
    "Oh yes you do.",
    "Hilary paused struggling for words.",
    "There were so many things she\nwanted to say.",
    "To express indignation.",
    "To order him out of the\nroom.",
    "But strangely enough it was curiosity that won the day.",
    "The\nquestion rose to her lips so naturally that she was almost unaware\nof asking it.",
    "That key she said it turned of itself in the lock\n\n\fOh that The young man gave a sudden boyish grin that\ntransformed his face.",
    "He put his hand into his pocket and taking\nout a metal instrument he handed it to her to examine.",
    "There you are he said very handy little tool.",
    "Insert it into the\nlock the other side it grips the key and turns it.",
    "He took it back\nfrom her and put it in his pocket.",
    "Burglars use them he said.",
    "So youre a burglar\n\nNo no Mrs. Craven do me justice.",
    "I did knock you know.",
    "Burglars dont knock.",
    "Then when it seemed you werent going to let\nme in I used this.",
    "But why\n\nAgain her visitors eyes strayed to the preparations on the table.",
    "I shouldnt do it if I were you he said.",
    "It isnt a bit what you think\nyou know.",
    "You think you just go to sleep and you dont wake up.",
    "But\nits not quite like that.",
    "All sorts of unpleasant effects.",
    "Convulsions\nsometimes gangrene of the skin.",
    "If youre resistant to the drug it\ntakes a long time to work and someone gets to you in time and then\nall sorts of unpleasant things happen.",
    "Stomach pump.",
    "Castor oil\nhot coffee slapping and pushing.",
    "All very undignified I assure\nyou.",
    "Hilary leaned back in her chair her eyelids narrowed.",
    "She\nclenched her hands slightly.",
    "She forced herself to smile.",
    "What a ridiculous person you are she said.",
    "Do you imagine that I\nwas committing suicide or something like that\n\nNot only imagine it said the young man called Jessop Im quite\nsure of it.",
    "I was in that chemist you know when you came in.",
    "Buying toothpaste as a matter of fact.",
    "Well they hadnt got the sort\nI like so I went to another shop.",
    "And there you were asking for\nsleeping pills again.",
    "Well I thought that was a bit odd you know so\nI followed you.",
    "All those sleeping pills at different places.",
    "It could\nonly add up to one thing.",
    "His tone was friendly offhand but quite assured.",
    "Looking at him\nHilary Craven abandoned pretence.",
    "Then dont you think it is unwarrantable impertinence on your part\nto try and stop me\n\nHe considered the point for a moment or two.",
    "Then he shook his\nhead.",
    "No.",
    "Its one of those things that you cant not do  if you\nunderstand.",
    "Hilary spoke with energy.",
    "You can stop me for the moment.",
    "I mean\nyou can take the pills away  throw them out of the window or\nsomething like that  but you cant stop me from buying more\nanother day or throwing myself down from the top floor of the\nbuilding or jumping in front of a train.",
    "The young man considered this.",
    "No he said.",
    "I agree I cant stop you doing any of those things.",
    "But its a question you know whether you will do them.",
    "Tomorrow\nthat is.",
    "You think I shall feel differently tomorrow asked Hilary faint\nbitterness in her tone.",
    "People do said Jessop almost apologetically.",
    "Yes perhaps she considered.",
    "If youre doing things in a mood of\nhot despair.",
    "But when its cold despair its different.",
    "Ive nothing to\nlive for you see.",
    "Jessop put his rather owlish head on one side and blinked.",
    "Interesting he remarked.",
    "Not really.",
    "Not interesting at all.",
    "Im not a very interesting woman.",
    "My husband whom I loved left me my only child died very painfully\nof meningitis.",
    "Ive no near friends or relations.",
    "Ive no vocation no\nart or craft or work that I love doing.",
    "Tough said Jessop appreciatively.",
    "He added rather hesitantly\nYou dont think of it as  wrong\n\nHilary said heatedly Why should it be wrong Its my life.",
    "Oh yes yes Jessop repeated hastily.",
    "Im not taking a high moral\nline myself but there are people you know who think its wrong.",
    "Hilary said\n\nIm not one of them.",
    "Mr. Jessop said rather inadequately\n\nQuite.",
    "He sat there looking at her blinking his eyes thoughtfully.",
    "Hilary\nsaid\n\nSo perhaps now Mr.  er \n\nJessop said the young man.",
    "So perhaps now Mr. Jessop you will leave me alone.",
    "But Jessop shook his head.",
    "Not just yet he said.",
    "I wanted to know you see just what was\nbehind it all.",
    "Ive got it clear now have I Youre not interested in\nlife you dont want to live any longer you more or less welcome the\nidea of death\n\nYes.",
    "Good said Jessop cheerfully.",
    "So now we know where we are.",
    "Lets go on to the next step.",
    "Has it got to be sleeping pills\n\nWhat do you mean\n\nWell Ive already told you that theyre not as romantic as they\nsound.",
    "Throwing yourself off a building isnt too nice either.",
    "You\ndont always die at once.",
    "And the same applies to falling under a\ntrain.",
    "What Im getting at is that there are other ways.",
    "I dont understand what you mean.",
    "Im suggesting another method.",
    "Rather a sporting method really.",
    "Theres some excitement in it too.",
    "Ill be fair with you.",
    "Theres just a\nhundred to one chance that you mightnt die.",
    "But I dont believe\nunder the circumstances that youd really object by that time.",
    "I havent the faintest idea what youre talking about.",
    "Of course you havent said Jessop.",
    "Ive not begun to tell you\nabout it yet.",
    "Im afraid Ill have to make rather a thing about it  tell\nyou a story I mean.",
    "Shall I go ahead\n\nI suppose so.",
    "Jessop paid no attention to the grudgingness of the assent.",
    "He\nstarted off in his most owllike manner.",
    "Youre the sort of woman who reads the papers and keeps up with\nthings generally I expect he said.",
    "Youll have read about the\n\n\fdisappearance of various scientists from time to time.",
    "There was\nthat Italian chap about a year ago and about two months ago a\nyoung scientist called Thomas Betterton disappeared.",
    "Hilary nodded.",
    "Yes I read about that in the papers.",
    "Well theres been a good deal more than has appeared in the\npapers.",
    "More people I mean have disappeared.",
    "They havent\nalways been scientists.",
    "Some of them have been young men who\nwere engaged in important medical research.",
    "Some of them have\nbeen research chemists some of them have been physicists there\nwas one barrister.",
    "Oh quite a lot here and there and everywhere.",
    "Well ours is a socalled free country.",
    "You can leave it if you like.",
    "But in these peculiar circumstances weve got to know why these\npeople left it and where they went and also important how they\nwent.",
    "Did they go of their own free will Were they kidnapped\nWere they blackmailed into going What route did they take  what\nkind of organisation is it that sets this in motion and what is its\nultimate aim Lots of questions.",
    "We want the answer to them.",
    "You\nmight be able to help get us that answer.",
    "Hilary stared at him.",
    "Me How Why\n\nIm coming down to the particular case of Thomas Betterton.",
    "He\ndisappeared from Paris just over two months ago.",
    "He left a wife in\nEngland.",
    "She was distracted  or said she was distracted.",
    "She\nswore that she had no idea why hed gone or where or how.",
    "That\n\n\fmay be true or it may not.",
    "Some people  and Im one of them  think\nit wasnt true.",
    "Hilary leaned forward in her chair.",
    "In spite of herself she was\nbecoming interested.",
    "Jessop went on.",
    "We prepared to keep a nice unobtrusive eye on Mrs. Betterton.",
    "About a fortnight ago she came to me and told me she had been\nordered by her doctor to go abroad take a thorough rest and get\nsome distraction.",
    "She was doing no good in England and people\nwere continually bothering her  newspaper reporters relations\nkind friends.",
    "Hilary said drily I can imagine it.",
    "Yes tough.",
    "Quite natural she would want to get away for a bit.",
    "Quite natural I should think.",
    "But weve got nasty suspicious minds in our department you\nknow.",
    "We arranged to keep tabs on Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Yesterday she\nleft England as arranged for Casablanca.",
    "Casablanca\n\nYes  en route to other places in Morocco of course.",
    "All quite open\nand above board plans made bookings ahead.",
    "But it may be that\nthis trip to Morocco is where Mrs. Betterton steps off into the\nunknown.",
    "Hilary shrugged her shoulders.",
    "I dont see where I come into all this.",
    "Jessop smiled.",
    "You come into it because youve got a very magnificent head of red\nhair Mrs. Craven.",
    "Hair\n\nYes.",
    "Its the most noticeable thing about Mrs. Betterton  her hair.",
    "Youve heard perhaps that the plane before yours today crashed\non landing.",
    "I know.",
    "I should have been on that plane.",
    "I actually had\nreservations for it.",
    "Interesting said Jessop.",
    "Well Mrs. Betterton was on that plane.",
    "She wasnt killed.",
    "She was taken out of the wreckage still alive and\nshe is in hospital now.",
    "But according to the doctor she wont be\nalive tomorrow morning.",
    "A faint glimmer of light came to Hilary.",
    "She looked at him\nenquiringly.",
    "Yes said Jessop perhaps now you see the form of suicide Im\noffering you.",
    "Im suggesting that Mrs. Betterton goes on with her\njourney.",
    "Im suggesting that you should become Mrs. Betterton.",
    "But surely said Hilary that would be quite impossible.",
    "I mean\ntheyd know at once she wasnt me.",
    "Jessop put his head on one side.",
    "That of course depends entirely on who you mean by they.",
    "Its a\nvery vague term.",
    "Who is or are they Is there such a thing are\nthere such persons as they We dont know.",
    "But I can tell you this.",
    "If the most popular explanation of they is accepted then these\npeople work in very close selfcontained cells.",
    "They do that for\ntheir own security.",
    "If Mrs. Bettertons journey had a purpose and is\nplanned then the people who were in charge of it here will know\nnothing about the English side of it.",
    "At the appointed moment they\nwill contact a certain woman at a certain place and carry on from\nthere.",
    "Mrs. Bettertons passport description is fivefeetseven red\nhair blue eyes mouth medium no distinguishing marks.",
    "Good\nenough.",
    "But the authorities here.",
    "Surely they \n\nJessop smiled.",
    "That part of it will be quite all right.",
    "The French\nhave lost a few valuable young scientists and chemists of their own.",
    "Theyll cooperate.",
    "The facts will be as follows.",
    "Mrs. Betterton\nsuffering from concussion is taken to hospital.",
    "Mrs. Craven\nanother passenger in the crashed plane will also be admitted to\nhospital.",
    "Within a day or two Mrs. Craven will die in hospital and\nMrs.\n\nBetterton\n\nwill\n\nbe\n\ndischarged\n\nsuffering\n\nslightly\n\nfrom\n\nconcussion but able to proceed on her tour.",
    "The crash was\ngenuine the concussion is genuine and concussion makes a very\n\n\fgood cover for you.",
    "It excuses a lot of things like lapses of memory\nand various unpredictable behaviour.",
    "Hilary said\n\nIt would be madness\n\nOh yes said Jessop its madness all right.",
    "Its a very tough\nassignment and if our suspicions are realised youll probably cop\nit.",
    "You see Im being quite frank but according to you youre\nprepared and anxious to cop it.",
    "As an alternative to throwing\nyourself in front of a train or something like that.",
    "I should think\nyoud find it far more amusing.",
    "Suddenly and unexpectedly Hilary laughed.",
    "I do believe she said that youre quite right.",
    "Youll do it\n\nYes.",
    "Why not.",
    "In that case said Jessop rising in his seat with sudden energy\ntheres absolutely no time to be lost\n\nChapter 4\n\n\fIt was not really cold in the hospital but it felt cold.",
    "There was a\nsmell of antiseptics in the air.",
    "Occasionally in the corridor outside\ncould be heard the rattle of glasses and instruments as a trolley\nwas pushed by.",
    "Hilary Craven sat in a hard iron chair by a bedside.",
    "In the bed lying flat under a shaded light with her head bandaged\nOlive Betterton lay unconscious.",
    "There was a nurse standing on\none side of the bed and the doctor on the other.",
    "Jessop sat in a\nchair in the far corner of the room.",
    "The doctor turned to him and\nspoke in French.",
    "It will not be very long now he said.",
    "The pulse is very much\nweaker.",
    "And she will not recover consciousness\n\nThe Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.",
    "That I cannot say.",
    "It may be yes at the very end.",
    "There is nothing you can do  no stimulant\n\nThe doctor shook his head.",
    "He went out.",
    "The nurse followed him.",
    "She was replaced by a nun who moved to the head of the bed and\nstood there fingering her rosary.",
    "Hilary looked at Jessop and in\nobedience to a glance from him came to join him.",
    "You heard what the doctor said he asked in a low voice.",
    "Yes.",
    "What is it you want to say to her\n\n\fIf she regains consciousness I want any information you can\npossibly get any password any sign any message anything.",
    "Do\nyou understand She is more likely to speak to you than to me.",
    "Hilary said with sudden emotion\n\nYou want me to betray someone who is dying\n\nJessop put his head on one side in the birdlike manner which he\nsometimes adopted.",
    "So it seems like that to you does it he said considering.",
    "Yes it does.",
    "He looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "Very well then you shall say and do what you please.",
    "For myself I\ncan have no scruples You understand that\n\nOf course.",
    "Its your duty.",
    "Youll do whatever questioning you\nplease but dont ask me to do it.",
    "Youre a free agent.",
    "There is one question we shall have to decide.",
    "Are we to tell her\nthat she is dying\n\nI dont know.",
    "I shall have to think it out.",
    "She nodded and went back to her place by the bed.",
    "She was filled\nnow with a deep compassion for the woman who lay there dying.",
    "The woman who was on her way to join the man she loved.",
    "Or were\nthey all wrong Had she come to Morocco simply to seek solace to\npass the time until perhaps some definite news could come to her\nas to whether her husband were alive or dead Hilary wondered.",
    "Time went on.",
    "It was nearly two hours later when the click of the\nnuns beads stopped.",
    "She spoke in a soft impersonal voice.",
    "There is a change she said.",
    "I think Madame it is the end that\ncomes.",
    "I will fetch the doctor.",
    "She left the room.",
    "Jessop moved to the opposite side of the bed\nstanding back against the wall so that he was out of the womans\nrange of vision.",
    "The eyelids flickered and opened.",
    "Pale incurious\nblue eyes looked into Hilarys.",
    "They closed then opened again.",
    "A\nfaint air of perplexity seemed to come into them.",
    "Where...",
    "The word fluttered between the almost breathless lips just as the\ndoctor entered the room.",
    "He took her hand in his his finger on the\npulse standing by the bed looking down on her.",
    "You are in hospital Madame he said.",
    "There was an accident to\nthe plane.",
    "To the plane\n\n\fThe words were repeated dreamily in that faint breathless voice.",
    "Is there anyone you want to see in Casablanca Madame Any\nmessage we can take\n\nHer eyes were raised painfully to the doctors face.",
    "She said\n\nNo.",
    "She looked back again at Hilary.",
    "Who  who \n\nHilary bent forward and spoke clearly and distinctly.",
    "I came out from England on a plane too  if there is anything I can\ndo to help you please tell me.",
    "No  nothing  nothing  unless \n\nYes\n\nNothing.",
    "The eyes flickered again and half closed  Hilary raised her head\nand looked across to meet Jessops imperious commanding glance.",
    "Firmly she shook her head.",
    "Jessop moved forward.",
    "He stood close beside the doctor.",
    "The\ndying womans eyes opened again.",
    "Sudden recognition came into\nthem.",
    "She said\n\nI know you.",
    "Yes Mrs. Betterton you know me.",
    "Will you tell me anything you\ncan about your husband\n\nNo.",
    "Her eyelids fell again.",
    "Jessop turned quietly and left the room.",
    "The\ndoctor looked across at Hilary.",
    "He said very softly\n\nCest la fin\n\nThe dying womans eyes opened again.",
    "They travelled painfully\nround the room then they remained fixed on Hilary.",
    "Olive Betterton\nmade a very faint motion with her hand and Hilary instinctively took\nthe white cold hand between her own.",
    "The doctor with a shrug of\nhis shoulders and a little bow left the room.",
    "The two women were\nalone together.",
    "Olive Betterton was trying to speak\n\nTell me  tell me \n\nHilary knew what she was asking and suddenly her own course of\naction opened clearly before her.",
    "She leaned down over the\nrecumbent form.",
    "Yes she said her words clear and emphatic.",
    "You are dying.",
    "Thats what you want to know isnt it Now listen to me.",
    "I am going\nto try and reach your husband.",
    "Is there any message you want me\nto give him if I succeed\n\nTell him  tell him  to be careful.",
    "Boris  Boris  dangerous...",
    "The breath fluttered off again with a sigh.",
    "Hilary bent closer.",
    "Is there anything you can tell me to help me  help me in my\njourney I mean Help me to get in contact with your husband\n\nSnow.",
    "The word came so faintly that Hilary was puzzled.",
    "Snow Snow\nShe repeated it uncomprehendingly.",
    "A faint ghostlike little giggle\ncame from Olive Betterton.",
    "Faint words came tumbling out\n\nSnow snow beautiful snow\n\nYou slip on a lump and over you go\n\nShe repeated the last word.",
    "Go... Go Go and tell him about Boris.",
    "I didnt believe it.",
    "I wouldnt believe it.",
    "But perhaps its true...",
    "If so if\nso... a kind of agonised question came into her eyes which stared\nup into Hilarys.",
    "... take care...\n\nA queer little rattle came to her throat.",
    "Her lips jerked.",
    "Olive Betterton died.",
    "II\n\nThe next five days were strenuous mentally though inactive\nphysically.",
    "Immured in a private room in the hospital Hilary was set\nto work.",
    "Every evening she had to pass an examination on what she\nhad studied that day.",
    "All the details of Olive Bettertons life as far\nas they could be ascertained were set down on paper and she had\nto memorise and learn them by heart.",
    "The house she had lived in\nthe daily women she had employed her relations the names of her\npet dog and her canary every detail of the six months of her\nmarried life with Thomas Betterton.",
    "Her wedding the names of her\nbridesmaids their dresses the patterns of curtains carpets and\nchintzes.",
    "Olive Bettertons tastes predilections and day by day\nactivities.",
    "Her preferences in food and drink.",
    "Hilary was forced to\nmarvel at the amount of seemingly meaningless information that\nhad been massed together.",
    "Once she said to Jessop\n\nCan any of this possibly matter\n\nAnd to that he had replied quietly\n\nProbably not.",
    "But youve got to make yourself into the authentic\narticle.",
    "Think of it this way Hilary.",
    "Youre a writer.",
    "Youre writing a\nbook about a woman.",
    "The woman is Olive.",
    "You describe scenes of\nher childhood her girlhood you describe her marriage the house\n\n\fshe lived in.",
    "All the time that you do it she becomes more and more\nof a real person to you.",
    "Then you go over it a second time.",
    "You write\nit this time as an autobiography.",
    "You write it in the first person.",
    "Do\nyou see what I mean\n\nShe nodded slowly impressed in spite of herself.",
    "You cant think of yourself as Olive Betterton until you are Olive\nBetterton.",
    "It would be better if you had time to learn it up but we\ncant afford time.",
    "So Ive got to cram you.",
    "Cram you like a schoolboy\n like a student who is going in for an important examination.",
    "He\nadded Youve got a quick brain and a good memory thank the\nLord.",
    "He looked at her in cool appraisement.",
    "The passport descriptions of Olive Betterton and Hilary Craven\nwere almost identical but actually the two faces were entirely\ndifferent.",
    "Olive Betterton had had a quality of rather commonplace\nand insignificant prettiness.",
    "She had looked obstinate but not\nintelligent.",
    "Hilarys face had power and an intriguing quality.",
    "The\ndeep set bluishgreen eyes under dark level brows had fire and\nintelligence in their depths.",
    "Her mouth curved upwards in a wide\nand generous line.",
    "The plane of the jaw was unusual  a sculptor\nwould have found the angles of the face interesting.",
    "Jessop thought Theres passion there  and guts  and\nsomewhere damped but not quenched theres a gay spirit thats\ntough  and that enjoys life and searches out for adventure.",
    "Youll do he said to her.",
    "Youre an apt pupil.",
    "This challenge to her intellect and her memory had stimulated\nHilary.",
    "She was becoming interested now keen to achieve\nsuccess.",
    "Once or twice objections occurred to her.",
    "She voiced\nthem to Jessop.",
    "You say that I shant be rejected as Olive Betterton.",
    "You say that\nthey wont know what she looks like except in general detail.",
    "But\nhow sure can you be of that\n\nJessop shrugged his shoulders.",
    "One cant be sure  of anything.",
    "But we do know a certain amount\nabout the set up of these shows and it does seem that\ninternationally there is very little communication from one country\nto another.",
    "Actually thats a great advantage to them.",
    "If we come\nupon a weak link in England and mind you in every organisation\nthere always will be a weak link that weak link in the chain knows\nnothing about whats going on in France or Italy or Germany or\nwherever you like we are brought up short by a blank wall.",
    "They\nknow their own little part of the whole  no more.",
    "The same applies\nthe opposite way round.",
    "I dare swear that all the cell operating here\nknows is that Olive Betterton will arrive on such and such a plane\nand is to be given such and such instructions.",
    "You see its not as\nthough she were important in herself.",
    "If theyre bringing her to her\nhusband its because her husband wants her brought to him and\nbecause they think theyll get better work out of him if she joins him.",
    "She herself is a mere pawn in the game.",
    "You must remember too\nthat the idea of substituting a false Olive Betterton is definitely a\n\n\fspur of the moment improvisation  occasioned by the plane\naccident and the colour of your hair.",
    "Our plan of operation was to\nkeep tabs on Olive Betterton and find out where she went how she\nwent whom she met  and so on.",
    "Thats what the other side will be\non the look out for.",
    "Hilary asked\n\nHavent you tried all that before\n\nYes.",
    "It was tried in Switzerland.",
    "Very unobtrusively.",
    "And it failed as\nfar as our main objective was concerned.",
    "If anyone contacted her\nthere we didnt know about it.",
    "So the contact must have been very\nbrief.",
    "Naturally theyll expect that someone will be keeping tabs on\nOlive Betterton.",
    "Theyll be prepared for that.",
    "Its up to us to do our\njob more thoroughly than last time.",
    "Weve got to try and be rather\nmore cunning than our adversaries.",
    "So youll be keeping tabs on me\n\nOf course.",
    "How\n\nHe shook his head.",
    "I shant tell you that.",
    "Much better for you not to know.",
    "What you\ndont know you cant give away.",
    "Do you think I would give it away\n\n\fJessop put on his owllike expression again.",
    "I dont know how good an actress you are  how good a liar.",
    "Its not\neasy you know.",
    "Its not a question of saying anything indiscreet.",
    "It\ncan be anything a sudden intake of the breath the momentary\npause in some action  lighting a cigarette for instance.",
    "Recognition of a name or a friend.",
    "You could cover it up quickly but\njust a flash might be enough\n\nI see.",
    "It means  being on your guard for every single split second.",
    "Exactly.",
    "In the meantime on with the lessons Quite like going\nback to school isnt it Youre pretty well wordperfect on Olive\nBetterton now.",
    "Lets go on to the other.",
    "Codes responses various properties.",
    "The lesson went on the\nquestioning the repetition the endeavour to confuse her to trip\nher up then hypothetical schemes and her own reactions to them.",
    "In the end Jessop nodded his head and declared himself satisfied.",
    "Youll do he said.",
    "He patted her on the shoulder in an avuncular\nmanner.",
    "Youre an apt pupil.",
    "And remember this however much\nyou may feel at times that youre all alone in this youre probably\nnot.",
    "I say probably  I wont put it higher than that.",
    "These are clever\ndevils.",
    "What happens said Hilary if I reach journeys end\n\nYou mean\n\n\fI mean when at last I come face to face with Tom Betterton.",
    "Jessop nodded grimly.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Thats the danger moment.",
    "I can only say that at\nthat moment if all has gone well you should have protection.",
    "If\nthat is to say things have gone as we hope but the very basis of\nthis operation as you may remember was that there wasnt a very\nhigh chance of survival.",
    "Didnt you say one in a hundred said Hilary drily.",
    "I think we can shorten the odds a little.",
    "I didnt know what you\nwere like.",
    "No I suppose not.",
    "She was thoughtful.",
    "To you I suppose I was\njust...",
    "He finished the sentence for her\n\nA woman with a noticeable head of red hair and who hadnt the\npluck to go on living.",
    "She flushed.",
    "Thats a harsh judgment.",
    "Its a true one isnt it I dont go in for being sorry for people.",
    "For\none thing its insulting.",
    "One is only sorry for people when theyre\n\n\fsorry for themselves.",
    "Selfpity is one of the biggest stumbling\nblocks in the world today.",
    "Hilary said thoughtfully\n\nI think perhaps youre right.",
    "Will you permit yourself to be sorry for\nme when Ive been liquidated or whatever the term is in fulfilling\nthis mission\n\nSorry for you No.",
    "I shall curse like hell because weve lost\nsomeone whos worth while taking a bit of trouble over.",
    "A compliment at last.",
    "In spite of herself she was pleased.",
    "She went on in a practical tone\n\nTheres just one other thing that occurred to me.",
    "You say nobodys\nlikely to know what Olive Betterton looks like but what about being\nrecognised as myself I dont know anyone in Casablanca but\nthere are the people who travelled here with me in the plane.",
    "Or\none may of course run across somebody one knows among the\ntourists here.",
    "You neednt worry about the passengers in the plane.",
    "The people\nwho flew with you from Paris were business men who went on to\nDakar and a man who got off here who has since flown back to\nParis.",
    "You will go to a different hotel when you leave here the hotel\nfor which Mrs. Betterton had reservations.",
    "You will be wearing her\nclothes and her style of hairdressing and one or two strips of\nplaster at the sides of your face will make you look very different in\n\n\ffeature.",
    "Weve got a doctor coming to work upon you by the way.",
    "Local anaesthetic so it wont hurt but you will have to have a few\ngenuine marks of the accident.",
    "Youre very thorough said Hilary.",
    "Have to be.",
    "Youve never asked me said Hilary whether Olive Betterton told\nme anything before she died.",
    "I understood you had scruples.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I respect you for them.",
    "Id like to indulge in them myself but theyre not in the schedule.",
    "She did say something that perhaps I ought to tell you.",
    "She said\nTell him  Betterton that is  tell him to be careful  Boris dangerous \n\nBoris.",
    "Jessop repeated the name with interest.",
    "Ah Our correct\nforeign Major Boris Glydr.",
    "You know him Who is he\n\nA Pole.",
    "He came to see me in London.",
    "Hes supposed to be a\ncousin of Tom Betterton by marriage.",
    "Supposed\n\nLet us say more correctly that if he is who he says he is he is a\ncousin of the late Mrs. Betterton.",
    "But weve only his word for it.",
    "She was frightened said Hilary frowning.",
    "Can you describe\nhim Id like to be able to recognise him.",
    "Yes.",
    "It might be as well.",
    "Six foot.",
    "Weight roughly 160 lbs.",
    "Fair rather wooden poker face  light eyes  foreign stilted manner English very correct but a pronounced accent military bearing.",
    "He added\n\nI had him tailed when he left my office.",
    "Nothing doing.",
    "He went\nstraight to the U.S. Embassy  quite correctly  hed brought me an\nintroductory letter from there.",
    "The usual kind they send out when\nthey want to be polite but noncommittal.",
    "I presume he left the\nEmbassy either in somebodys car or by the back entrance\ndisguised as a footman or something.",
    "Anyway he evaded us.",
    "Yes  I\nshould say that Olive Betterton was perhaps right when she said\nthat Boris Glydr was dangerous.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nIn the small formal salon of the Hotel St. Louis three ladies were\nsitting each engaged in her particular occupation.",
    "Mrs. Calvin\nBaker short plump with well blued hair was writing letters with\n\n\fthe same driving energy she applied to all forms of activity.",
    "No one\ncould have mistaken Mrs. Calvin Baker for anything but a travelling\nAmerican comfortably off with an inexhaustible thirst for precise\ninformation on every subject under the sun.",
    "In an uncomfortable Empire type chair Miss Hetherington who\nagain could not have been mistaken for anything but travelling\nEnglish was knitting one of those melancholy shapeless looking\ngarments that English ladies of middle age always seem to be\nknitting.",
    "Miss Hetherington was tall and thin with a scraggy neck\nbadly\n\narranged\n\nhair\n\nand\n\na\n\ngeneral\n\nexpression\n\nof\n\nmoral\n\ndisapprovement of the Universe.",
    "Mademoiselle Jeanne Maricot was sitting gracefully in an upright\nchair looking out of the window and yawning.",
    "Mademoiselle\nMaricot was a brunette dyed blonde with a plain but excitingly\nmadeup face.",
    "She was wearing chic clothes and had no interest\nwhatsoever in the other occupants of the room whom she\ndismissed contemptuously in her mind as being exactly what they\nwere She was contemplating an important change in her sex life\nand had no interest to spare for these animals of tourists\n\nMiss Hetherington and Mrs. Calvin Baker having both spent a\ncouple of nights under the roof of the St. Louis had become\nacquainted.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker with American friendliness talked\nto everybody.",
    "Miss Hetherington though just as eager for\ncompanionship talked only to English and Americans of what she\nconsidered a certain social standing.",
    "The French she had no truck\nwith unless guaranteed of respectable family life as evidenced by\nlittle ones who shared the parental table in the dining room.",
    "A Frenchman looking like a prosperous business man glanced into\nthe salon was intimidated by its air of female solidarity and went\nout again with a look of lingering regret at Mademoiselle Jeanne\nMaricot.",
    "Miss Hetherington began to count stitches sotto voce.",
    "Twentyeight twentynine  now what can I have  Oh I see.",
    "A tall woman with red hair looked into the room and hesitated a\nmoment before going on down the passage towards the dining\nroom.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker and Miss Hetherington were immediately alert.",
    "Mrs. Baker slewed herself round from the writing table and spoke in\na thrilled whisper.",
    "Did you happen to notice that woman with red hair who looked in\nMiss Hetherington They say shes the only survivor of that terrible\nplane crash last week.",
    "I saw her arrive this afternoon said Miss Hetherington dropping\nanother stitch in her excitement.",
    "In an ambulance.",
    "Straight from the hospital so the manager said.",
    "I wonder now if it\nwas wise  to leave hospital so soon.",
    "Shes had concussion I\nbelieve.",
    "Shes got strapping on her face too  cut perhaps by the glass.",
    "What a mercy she wasnt burnt.",
    "Terrible injuries from burning in\nthese air accidents I believe.",
    "It just doesnt bear thinking about.",
    "Poor young thing.",
    "I wonder if\nshe had a husband with her and if he was killed\n\nI dont think so Miss Hetherington shook her yellow grey head.",
    "It\nsaid in the paper one woman passenger.",
    "Thats right.",
    "It gave her name too.",
    "A Mrs. Beverly  no Betterton\nthat was it.",
    "Betterton said Miss Hetherington reflectively.",
    "Now what does\nthat remind me of Betterton.",
    "In the papers.",
    "Oh dear Im sure that\nwas the name.",
    "Tant pis pour Pierre  Mademoiselle Maricot said to herself.",
    "Il est\nvraiment insupportable Mais le petit Jules lui il est bien gentil.",
    "Et\nson p\u00e8re est tres bien plac\u00e9 dans les affaires.",
    "Enfin je me decide\n\nAnd with long graceful steps Mademoiselle Maricot walked out of\nthe small salon and out of the story.",
    "II\n\n\fMrs. Thomas Betterton had left the hospital that afternoon five days\nafter the accident.",
    "An ambulance had driven her to the Hotel St.\nLouis.",
    "Looking pale and ill her face strapped and bandaged Mrs.\nBetterton was shown at once to the room reserved for her a\nsympathetic manager hovering in attendance.",
    "What emotions you must have experienced Madame he said\nafter enquiring tenderly as to whether the room reserved suited\nher and turning on all the electric lights quite unnecessarily.",
    "But\nwhat an escape What a miracle What good fortune.",
    "Only three\nsurvivors I understand and one of them in a critical condition still.",
    "Hilary sank down on a chair wearily.",
    "Yes indeed she murmured.",
    "I can hardly believe it myself.",
    "Even\nnow I can remember so little.",
    "The last twentyfour hours before the\ncrash are still quite vague to me.",
    "The manager nodded sympathetically.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "That is the result of the concussion.",
    "That happened once\nto a sister of mine.",
    "She was in London in the war.",
    "A bomb came she\nwas knocked unconscious.",
    "But presently she gets up she walks\nabout London and she takes a train from the station of Euston and\nfigurezvous she wakes up at Liverpool and she cannot remember\nanything of the bomb of going across London of the train or of\ngetting there The last thing she remembers is hanging up her skirt\n\n\fin the wardrobe in London.",
    "Very curious these things are they\nnot\n\nHilary agreed that they were indeed.",
    "The manager bowed and\ndeparted.",
    "Hilary got up and looked at herself in the glass.",
    "So\nimbued was she now with her new personality that she positively\nfelt the weakness in her limbs which would be natural to one who\nhad just come out of hospital after a severe ordeal.",
    "She had already enquired at the desk but there had been no\nmessages or letters for her there.",
    "The first steps in her new role\nhad to be taken very much in the dark.",
    "Olive Betterton might\nperhaps have been told to ring a certain number or to contact a\ncertain person at Casablanca.",
    "As to that there was no clue.",
    "All the\nknowledge she had to go on was Olive Bettertons passport her\nletter of credit and her book of Cooks tickets and reservations.",
    "These provided for two days in Casablanca six days in Fez and five\ndays in Marrakesh.",
    "These reservations were now of course out of\ndate and would have to be dealt with accordingly.",
    "The passport\nthe Letter of Credit and the accompanying Letter of Identification\nhad been suitably dealt with.",
    "The photograph on the passport was\nnow that of Hilary the signature on the Letter of Credit was Olive\nBetterton in Hilarys handwriting.",
    "Her credentials were all in order.",
    "Her task was to play her part adequately and to wait.",
    "Her master\ncard must be the plane accident and its resultant loss of memory\nand general haziness.",
    "It had been a genuine accident and Olive Betterton had been\ngenuinely on board the plane.",
    "The fact of concussion would\nadequately cover her failure to adopt any measures in which she\n\n\fmight have been instructed.",
    "Bewildered dazed weak Olive\nBetterton would await orders.",
    "The natural thing to do would be to rest.",
    "Accordingly she lay down\non the bed.",
    "For two hours she went over in her mind all that she had\nbeen taught.",
    "Olives luggage had been destroyed in the plane.",
    "Hilary had a few things with her supplied at the hospital.",
    "She\npassed a comb through her hair touched her lips with a lipstick\nand went down to the hotel dining room for dinner.",
    "She was looked at she noticed with a certain amount of interest.",
    "There were several tables occupied by business men and these\nhardly vouchsafed a glance at her.",
    "But at other tables clearly\noccupied by tourists she was conscious of a murmur and a\nwhisper going on.",
    "That woman over there  the one with the red hair  shes a survivor\nof the plane crash my dear.",
    "Yes came from hospital in an\nambulance.",
    "I saw her arrive.",
    "She looks terribly ill still.",
    "I wonder if\nthey ought to have let her out so soon.",
    "What a frightful experience.",
    "What a merciful escape\n\nAfter dinner Hilary sat for a short while in the small formal salon.",
    "She wondered if anyone would approach her in any way.",
    "There\nwere one or two other women scattered about the room and\npresently a small plump middleaged woman with wellblued white\nhair moved to a chair near hers.",
    "She opened proceedings in a\nbrisk pleasant American voice.",
    "I do hope youll excuse me but I just felt I had to say a word.",
    "Its\nyou isnt it who had the wonderful escape from that air crash the\nother day\n\nHilary put down the magazine she was reading.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "My Isnt that terrible The crash I mean.",
    "Only three survivors they\nsay.",
    "Is that right\n\nOnly two said Hilary.",
    "One of the three died in hospital.",
    "My You dont say Now if you dont mind my asking Miss  Mrs...\n\nBetterton.",
    "Well if you dont mind my asking just where were you sitting in\nthat plane Were you up at the front or near the tail\n\nHilary knew the answer to that one and gave it promptly.",
    "Near the tail.",
    "They always say dont they thats the safest place.",
    "I just insist\nnow on always having a place near the rear doors.",
    "Did you hear\nthat Miss Hetherington She turned her head to include another\nmiddleaged lady.",
    "This one was uncompromisingly British with a\nlong sad horselike face.",
    "Its just as I was saying the other day.",
    "Whenever you go into an aeroplane dont you let those air\nhostesses take you right up to the front.",
    "I suppose someone has to sit at the front said Hilary.",
    "Well it wont be me said her new American friend promptly.",
    "My\nnames Baker by the way Mrs. Calvin Baker.",
    "Hilary acknowledged the introduction and Mrs. Baker plunged on\nmonopolising the conversation easily.",
    "Ive just come here from Mogador and Miss Hetherington has come\nfrom Tangier.",
    "We became acquainted here.",
    "Are you going to visit\nMarrakesh Mrs. Betterton\n\nId arranged to do so said Hilary.",
    "Of course this accident has\nthrown out all my time schedule.",
    "Why naturally I can see that.",
    "But you really mustnt miss\nMarrakesh wouldnt you say so Miss Hetherington\n\nMarrakesh is terribly expensive said Miss Hetherington.",
    "This\nmiserable travel allowance makes everything so difficult.",
    "Theres a wonderful hotel the Mamounia continued Mrs. Baker.",
    "Wickedly expensive said Miss Hetherington.",
    "Out of the question\nfor me.",
    "Of course its different for you Mrs. Baker  dollars I mean.",
    "But someone gave me the name of a small hotel there really very\nnice and clean and the food they say is not at all bad.",
    "Where else do you plan to go Mrs. Betterton asked Mrs. Calvin\nBaker.",
    "I would like to see Fez said Hilary cautiously.",
    "I shall have to get\nfresh reservations of course.",
    "Oh yes you certainly oughtnt to miss Fez or Rabat.",
    "Youve been there\n\nNot yet.",
    "Im planning to go there shortly and so is Miss\nHetherington.",
    "I believe the old city is quite unspoilt said Miss Hetherington.",
    "The conversation continued in desultory fashion for some time\nfurther.",
    "Then Hilary pleaded fatigue from her first day out of the\nhospital and went up to her bedroom.",
    "The evening so far had been quite indecisive.",
    "The two women who\nhad talked to her had been such wellknown travelling types that\nshe could hardly believe that they were other than they seemed.",
    "Tomorrow she decided if she had received no word or\ncommunication of any kind she would go to Cooks and raise the\nquestion of fresh reservations at Fez and Marrakesh.",
    "There were no letters messages or telephone calls the following\nmorning and about eleven oclock she made her way to the travel\nagency.",
    "There was somewhat of a queue but when she at last\n\n\freached the counter and began talking to the clerk an interruption\noccurred.",
    "A somewhat more senior clerk with glasses elbowed the\nyoung man aside.",
    "He beamed at Hilary through his glasses.",
    "It is Madame Betterton is it not I have all your reservations\nmade.",
    "I am afraid said Hilary that they will be out of date.",
    "I have been\nin hospital and...\n\nAh mais oui I know all that.",
    "Let me congratulate you on your\nescape Madame.",
    "But I got your telephone message about fresh\nreservations and we have them here ready for you.",
    "Hilary felt a faint quickening of her pulse.",
    "As far as she knew no one\nhad phoned the travel agency.",
    "Here then were definite signs that\nOlive Bettertons travelling arrangements were being supervised.",
    "She said\n\nI wasnt sure if they had telephoned or not.",
    "But yes Madame.",
    "Here I will show you.",
    "He\n\nproduced\n\nrailway\n\ntickets\n\nand\n\nvouchers\n\nfor\n\nhotel\n\naccommodation and a few minutes later the transactions were\ncompleted.",
    "Hilary was to leave for Fez on the following day.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker was not in the restaurant either for lunch or\ndinner.",
    "Miss Hetherington was.",
    "She acknowledged Hilarys bow as\nthe latter passed to her table but made no attempt to get into\n\n\fconversation with her.",
    "On the following day after making some\nnecessary purchases of clothes and underclothing Hilary left by\ntrain for Fez.",
    "III\n\nIt was on the day of Hilarys departure that Mrs. Calvin Baker\ncoming into the hotel in her usual brisk fashion was accosted by\nMiss Hetherington whose long thin nose was quivering with\nexcitement.",
    "Ive remembered about the name Betterton  the disappearing\nscientist.",
    "It was in all the papers.",
    "About two months ago.",
    "Why now I do remember something.",
    "A British scientist  yes  hed\nbeen at some conference in Paris.",
    "Yes  thats it.",
    "Now I wonder do you think  this could possibly be\nhis wife.",
    "I looked in the register and I see her address is Harwell Harwell you know is the Atom Station.",
    "I do think all these atom\nbombs are very wrong.",
    "And Cobalt.",
    "Such a lovely colour in ones\npaintbox and I used it a lot as a child the worst of all I understand\nnobody can survive.",
    "We werent meant to do these experiments.",
    "Somebody told me the other day that her cousin who is a very\nshrewd man said the whole world might go radioactive.",
    "My my said Mrs. Calvin Baker.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nCasablanca had vaguely disappointed Hilary by being such a\nprosperouslooking French town with no hint of the orient or\nmystery about it except for the crowds in the streets.",
    "The weather was still perfect sunny and clear and she enjoyed\nlooking out of the train at the passing landscape as they journeyed\nnorthward.",
    "A small Frenchman who looked like a commercial\ntraveller sat opposite to her in the far corner was a somewhat\ndisapprovinglooking nun telling her beads and two Moorish ladies\nwith a great many packages who conversed gaily with one another\ncompleted the complement of the carriage.",
    "Offering a light for her\ncigarette the little Frenchman opposite soon entered into\nconversation.",
    "He pointed out things of interest as they passed and\ngave her various information about the country.",
    "She found him\ninteresting and intelligent.",
    "You should go to Rabat Madame.",
    "It is a great mistake not to go to\nRabat.",
    "I shall try to do so.",
    "But I have not very much time.",
    "Besides she\nsmiled.",
    "Money is short.",
    "We can only take so much with us abroad\nyou know.",
    "But that is simple.",
    "One arranges with a friend here.",
    "Im afraid I havent got a convenient friend in Morocco.",
    "Next time you travel Madame send me a little word.",
    "I will give you\nmy card.",
    "And I arrange everything.",
    "I travel often in England on\nbusiness and you repay me there.",
    "It is all quite simple.",
    "Thats very kind of you and I hope I shall pay a second visit to\nMorocco.",
    "It must be a change for you Madame to come here from England.",
    "So cold so foggy so disagreeable.",
    "Yes its a great change.",
    "I too I travelled from Paris three weeks ago.",
    "It was then fog rain\nand all of the most disgusting.",
    "I arrive here and all is sunshine.",
    "Though mind you the air is cold.",
    "But it is pure.",
    "Good pure air.",
    "How\nwas the weather in England when you left\n\nMuch as you say said Hilary.",
    "Fog.",
    "Ah yes it is the foggy season.",
    "Snow  you have had snow this\nyear\n\nNo said Hilary there has been no snow.",
    "She wondered to\nherself amusedly if this muchtravelled little Frenchman was\nfollowing what he considered to be the correct trend of English\nconversation dealing principally with the weather.",
    "She asked him a\nquestion or two about the political situation in Morocco and in\n\n\fAlgiers and he responded willingly showing himself to be well\ninformed.",
    "Glancing across at the far corner Hilary observed the nuns eyes\nfixed disapprovingly on her.",
    "The Moroccan ladies got out and other\ntravellers got in.",
    "It was evening when they arrived at Fez.",
    "Permit me to assist you Madame.",
    "Hilary was standing rather bewildered at the bustle and noise of\nthe station.",
    "Arab porters were seizing her luggage from her hands\nshouting yelling calling recommending different hotels.",
    "She\nturned gratefully to her new French acquaintance.",
    "You are going to the Palais Jamail nestcepas Madame\n\nYes.",
    "That is right.",
    "It is eight kilometres from here you understand.",
    "Eight kilometres Hilary was dismayed.",
    "Its not in the town\nthen.",
    "It is by the old town the Frenchman explained.",
    "Me I stay here at\nthe hotel in the commercial new city.",
    "But for the holiday the rest\nthe enjoyment naturally you go to the Palais Jamail.",
    "It was a former\nresidence you understand of the Moroccan nobility.",
    "It has\nbeautiful gardens and you go straight from it into the old city of Fez\nwhich is untouched.",
    "It does not seem as though the hotel had sent\nto meet this train.",
    "If you permit I will arrange for a taxi for you.",
    "Youre very kind but...",
    "The Frenchman spoke in rapid Arabic to the porters and shortly\nafterwards Hilary took her place in a taxi her baggage was pushed\nin and the Frenchman told her exactly what to give the rapacious\nporters.",
    "He also dismissed them with a few sharp words of Arabic\nwhen they protested that the remuneration was inadequate.",
    "He\nwhipped a card from his pocket and handed it to her.",
    "My card Madame and if I can be of assistance to you at any time\ntell me.",
    "I shall be at the Grand Hotel here for the next four days.",
    "He raised his hat and went away.",
    "Hilary looked down at the card\nwhich she could just see before they moved out of the lighted\nstation.",
    "MONSIEUR HENRI LAURIER\n\nThe taxi drove briskly out of the town through the country up a hill.",
    "Hilary tried to see looking out of the windows where she was\ngoing but darkness had set in now.",
    "Except when they passed a\nlighted building nothing much could be seen.",
    "Was this perhaps\nwhere her journey diverged from the normal and entered the\nunknown Was Monsieur Laurier an emissary from the organisation\nthat had persuaded Thomas Betterton to leave his work his home\nand his wife She sat in the corner of the taxi nervously\napprehensive wondering where it was taking her.",
    "It took her however in the most exemplary manner to the Palais\nJamail.",
    "She dismounted there passed through an arched gateway\nand found herself with a thrill of pleasure in an oriental interior.",
    "There were long divans coffee tables and native rugs.",
    "From the\nreception desk she was taken through several rooms which led out\nof each other out onto a terrace passing by orange trees and\nscented flowers and then up a winding staircase and into a\npleasant bedroom still oriental in style but equipped with all the\nconforts modernes so necessary to twentiethcentury travellers.",
    "Dinner the porter informed her took place from seventhirty.",
    "She\nunpacked a little washed combed her hair and went downstairs\nthrough the long oriental smoking room out on the terrace and\nacross and up some steps to a lighted dining room running at right\nangles to it.",
    "The dinner was excellent and as Hilary ate various people came\nand went from the restaurant.",
    "She was too tired to size them up and\nclassify them this particular evening but one or two outstanding\npersonalities took her eye.",
    "An elderly man very yellow of face with\na little goatee beard.",
    "She noticed him because of the extreme\ndeference paid to him by the staff.",
    "Plates were whisked away and\nplaced for him at the mere raising of his head.",
    "The slightest turn of\nan eyebrow brought a waiter rushing to his table.",
    "She wondered\nwho he was.",
    "The majority of diners were clearly touring on pleasure\ntrips.",
    "There was a German at a big table in the centre there was a\nmiddleaged man with a fair very beautiful girl whom she thought\nmight be Swedes or possibly Danes.",
    "There was an English family\n\n\fwith two children and various groups of travelling Americans.",
    "There were three French families.",
    "After dinner she had coffee on the terrace.",
    "It was slightly cold but\nnot unduly so and she enjoyed the smell of scented blossoms.",
    "She\nwent to bed early.",
    "Sitting on the terrace the following morning in the sunshine under\nthe red striped umbrella that protected her from the sun Hilary felt\nhow fantastic the whole thing was.",
    "Here she sat pretending to be a\ndead woman expecting something melodramatic and out of the\ncommon to occur.",
    "After all wasnt it only too likely that poor Olive\nBetterton had come abroad merely to distract her mind and heart\nfrom sad thoughts and feelings.",
    "Probably the poor woman had been\njust as much in the dark as everybody else.",
    "Certainly the words she had said before she died admitted of a\nperfectly ordinary explanation.",
    "She had wanted Thomas Betterton\nwarned against somebody called Boris.",
    "Her mind had wandered she had quoted a strange little jingle  she had gone on to say that\nshe couldnt believe it at first.",
    "Couldnt believe what Possibly only\nthat Thomas Betterton had been spirited away the way he had\nbeen.",
    "There had been no sinister undertones no helpful clues.",
    "Hilary\nstared down at the terrace garden below her.",
    "It was beautiful here.",
    "Beautiful and peaceful.",
    "Children chattered and ran up and down\nthe terrace French mammas called to them or scolded them.",
    "The\nblonde Swedish girl came and sat down by a table and yawned.",
    "She\n\n\ftook out a pale pink lipstick and touched up her already exquisitely\npainted lips.",
    "She appraised her face seriously frowning a little.",
    "Presently her companion  husband Hilary wondered or it might\npossibly be her father  joined her.",
    "She greeted him without a smile.",
    "She leaned forward and talked to him apparently expostulating\nabout something.",
    "He protested and apologised.",
    "The old man with the yellow face and the little goatee came up the\nterrace from the gardens below.",
    "He went and sat at a table against\nthe extreme wall and immediately a waiter darted forth.",
    "He gave an\norder and the waiter bowed before him and went away in all haste\nto execute it.",
    "The fair girl caught her companion excitedly by the\narm and looked towards the elderly man.",
    "Hilary ordered a Martini and when it came she asked the waiter in\na low voice\n\nWho is the old man there against the wall\n\nAh The waiter leaned forward dramatically That is Monsieur\nAristides.",
    "He is enormously  but yes enormously  rich.",
    "He sighed in ecstasy at the contemplation of so much wealth and\nHilary looked over at the shrivelled up bent figure at the far table.",
    "Such a wrinkled dried up mummified old morsel of humanity.",
    "And\nyet because of his enormous wealth waiters darted and sprang\nand spoke with awe in their voices.",
    "Old Monsieur Aristides shifted\nhis position.",
    "Just for a moment his eyes met hers.",
    "He looked at her\nfor a moment then looked away.",
    "Not so insignificant after all Hilary thought to herself.",
    "Those\neyes even at that distance had been wonderfully intelligent and\nalive.",
    "The blonde girl and her escort got up from their table and went into\nthe dining room.",
    "The waiter who now seemed to consider himself as\nHilarys guide and mentor stopped at her table as he collected\nglasses and gave her further information.",
    "Ce Monsieur l\u0430 he is a big business magnate from Sweden.",
    "Very\nrich very important.",
    "And the lady with him she is a film star another Garbo they say.",
    "Very chic  very beautiful  but does she\nmake him the scenes the histories Nothing pleases her.",
    "She is as\nyou say fed up to be here in Fez where there are no jewellers\nshops  and no other expensive women to admire and envy her\ntoilettes.",
    "She demands that he should take her somewhere more\namusing tomorrow.",
    "Ah it is not always the rich who can enjoy the\ntranquillity and peace of mind.",
    "Having uttered this last in a somewhat sententious fashion he saw\na beckoning forefinger and sprang across the terrace as though\ngalvanised.",
    "Monsieur\n\nMost people had gone in to lunch but Hilary had had breakfast late\nand was in no hurry for her midday meal.",
    "She ordered herself\nanother drink.",
    "A goodlooking young French man came out of the\nbar and across the terrace cast a swift discreet glance at Hilary\n\n\fwhich thinly disguised meant Is there anything doing here I\nwonder and then went down the steps to the terrace below.",
    "As he\ndid so he half sang half hummed a snatch of French opera\n\nLe long des lauriers roses\n\nRevant de douces choses.",
    "The words formed a little pattern on Hilarys brain.",
    "Le long des\nlauriers roses.",
    "Laurier.",
    "Laurier That was the name of the\nFrenchman in the train.",
    "Was there a connection here or was it\ncoincidence She opened her bag and hunted in it for the card he\nhad given her.",
    "Mons.",
    "Henri Laurier 3 Rue des Croissants\nCasablanca.",
    "She turned the card over and there seemed to be faint\npencil marks on the back of it.",
    "It was as though something had been\nwritten on it and then rubbed out.",
    "She tried to decipher what the\nmarks were.",
    "Q\u0449 sont the message began then something which\nshe could not decipher and finally she made out the words\nDantan.",
    "For a moment she had thought that it might be a\nmessage but now she shook her head and put the card back in her\nbag.",
    "It must have been some quotation that he had once written on\nit and then rubbed out.",
    "A shadow fell on her and she looked up startled.",
    "Mr. Aristides was\nstanding there between her and the sun.",
    "His eyes were not on her.",
    "He was looking across over the gardens below towards the\nsilhouette of hills in the distance.",
    "She heard him sigh and then he\nturned abruptly towards the dining room and as he did so the\n\n\fsleeve of his coat caught the glass on her table and sent it flying to\nthe terrace where it broke.",
    "He wheeled round quickly and politely.",
    "Ah.",
    "Mille pardons Madame.",
    "Hilary assured him smilingly in French that it did not matter in the\nleast.",
    "With the swift flick of a finger he summoned a waiter.",
    "The\nwaiter as usual came running.",
    "He ordered a replacement of\nMadames drink and then once more apologising he made his way\ninto the restaurant.",
    "The young Frenchman still humming came up the steps again.",
    "He\nlingered noticeably as he passed Hilary but as she gave no sign he\nwent on into lunch with a slight philosophic shrug of the shoulders.",
    "A French family passed across the terrace the parents calling to\ntheir young.",
    "Mais viens donc Bobo.",
    "Quest ce que tu fais D\u00e9p\u043aches toi\n\nLaisse ta balle cherie on va dejeuner.",
    "They passed up the steps and into the restaurant a happy\ncontented little nucleus of family life.",
    "Hilary felt suddenly alone and\nfrightened.",
    "The waiter brought her drink.",
    "She asked him if M. Aristides was all\nalone here\n\n\fOh Madame naturally anyone so rich as M. Aristides would never\ntravel alone.",
    "He has here his valet and two secretaries and a\nchauffeur.",
    "The waiter was quite shocked at the idea of M. Aristides travelling\nunaccompanied.",
    "Hilary noted however when she at last went into the dining room\nthat the old man sat at a table by himself as he had done on the\nprevious evening.",
    "At a table nearby sat two young men whom she\nthought were probably the secretaries since she noticed that one\nor the other of them was always on the alert and looked constantly\ntowards the table where M. Aristides shrivelled and monkeylike\nate his lunch and did not seem to notice their existence.",
    "Evidently\nto M. Aristides secretaries were not human\n\nThe afternoon passed in a vague dreamlike manner.",
    "Hilary strolled\nthrough the gardens descending from terrace to terrace.",
    "The\npeace and the beauty seemed quite astounding.",
    "There was the\nsplash of water the gleam of the golden oranges and innumerable\nscents and fragrances.",
    "It was the Oriental atmosphere of seclusion\nabout it that Hilary found so satisfying.",
    "As a garden enclosed is my\nsister my spouse...",
    "This was what a garden was meant to be a\nplace shut away from the world  full of green and gold \n\nIf I could stay here thought Hilary.",
    "If I could stay here always...",
    "It was not the actual garden of the Palais Jamail that was in her\nthoughts it was the state of mind it typified.",
    "When she no longer\nlooked for peace she had found it.",
    "And peace of mind had come to\n\n\fher at a moment when she was committed to adventure and\ndanger.",
    "But perhaps there was no danger and no adventure... Perhaps she\ncould stay here awhile and nothing would happen... and then...\n\nAnd then  what\n\nA little cold breeze sprang up and Hilary gave a quick shiver.",
    "You\nstrayed into the garden of peaceful living but in the end you would\nbe betrayed from within.",
    "The turmoil of the world the harshness of\nliving the regrets and despairs all these she carried within her.",
    "And it was late afternoon and the sun had lost its power.",
    "Hilary\nwent up the various terraces and into the hotel.",
    "In the gloom of the Oriental Lounge something voluble and cheerful\nresolved itself as Hilarys eyes got attuned to the dimness into\nMrs. Calvin Baker her hair newly blued and her appearance\nimmaculate as ever.",
    "Ive just got here by air she explained.",
    "I simply cant stand these\ntrains  the time they take And the people in them as often as not\nquite unsanitary Theyve no idea at all of hygiene in these\ncountries.",
    "My dear you should see the meat in the souks  all\nsmothered in flies.",
    "They just seem to think its natural to have flies\nsettling on everything.",
    "I suppose it is really said Hilary.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker was not going to allow such a heretical statement\nto pass.",
    "Im a great believer in the Clean Food movement.",
    "At home\neverything perishable is wrapped in cellophane  but even in\nLondon your bread and cakes just stand about unwrapped.",
    "Now tell\nme have you been getting around Youve been doing the old city\ntoday I expect\n\nIm afraid I havent done anything said Hilary smiling.",
    "Ive just\nbeen sitting about in the sun.",
    "Ah of course  youre just out of hospital.",
    "I forgot.",
    "Clearly only\nrecent illness was accepted by Mrs. Calvin Baker as an excuse for\nfailure to sightsee.",
    "How could I be so stupid Why its perfectly\ntrue after concussion you ought to lie down and rest in a dark room\nmost of the day.",
    "By and by we can make some expeditions together.",
    "Im one of those people who likes a real packed day  everything\nplanned and arranged.",
    "Every minute filled.",
    "In Hilarys present mood this sounded like a foretaste of hell but\nshe congratulated Mrs. Calvin Baker on her energy.",
    "Well I will say that for a woman of my age I get around pretty well.",
    "I hardly ever feel fatigue.",
    "Do you remember Miss Hetherington at\nCasablanca An Englishwoman with a long face.",
    "Shell be arriving\nthis evening.",
    "She prefers train to flying.",
    "Whos staying in the hotel\nMostly French I suppose.",
    "And honeymoon couples.",
    "I must run\nalong now and see about my room.",
    "I didnt like the one they gave\nme and they promised to change it.",
    "A miniature whirlwind of energy Mrs. Calvin Baker departed.",
    "When Hilary entered the dining room that evening the first thing\nshe saw was Miss Hetherington at a small table against the wall\neating her dinner with a Penguin book propped up in front of her.",
    "The three ladies had coffee together after dinner and Miss\nHetherington displayed a pleasurable excitement over the Swedish\nmagnate and the blonde film star.",
    "Not married I understand she breathed disguising her pleasure\nwith a correct disapproval.",
    "One sees so much of that sort of thing\nabroad.",
    "That seemed a nice French family at the table by the\nwindow.",
    "The children seemed so fond of their papa.",
    "Of course\nFrench children are allowed to sit up far too late.",
    "Ten oclock\nsometimes before they go to bed and they go through every course\non the menu instead of just having milk and biscuits as children\nshould.",
    "They seem to look quite healthy on it said Hilary laughing.",
    "Miss Hetherington shook her head and uttered a cluck of\ndisapproval.",
    "Theyll pay for it later she said with grim foreboding.",
    "Their\nparents even let them drink wine.",
    "Horror could go no further.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker began making plans for the next day.",
    "I dont think I shall go to the old city she said.",
    "I did that very\nthoroughly last time.",
    "Most interesting and quite a labyrinth if you\nknow what I mean.",
    "So quaint and old world.",
    "If I hadnt had the guide\nwith me I dont think I should have found my way back to the hotel.",
    "You just kind of lose your sense of direction.",
    "But the guide was a\nvery nice man and told me quite a lot of interesting things.",
    "He has a\nbrother in the States  in Chicago I think he said.",
    "Then when wed\nfinished with the town he took me up to a kind of eating house or\ntea room right up on the hillsides looking down over the old city  a\nmarvellous view.",
    "I had to drink that dreadful mint tea of course\nwhich is really very nasty.",
    "And they wanted me to buy various\nthings some quite nice but some just rubbish.",
    "One has to be very\nfirm I find.",
    "Yes indeed said Miss Hetherington.",
    "She added rather wistfully And of course one cant really spare\nthe money for souvenirs.",
    "These money restrictions are so\nworrying.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nHilary hoped to avoid having to see the old city of Fez in the\ndepressing company of Miss Hetherington.",
    "Fortunately the latter\nwas invited by Mrs. Baker to come with her on an expedition by car.",
    "Since Mrs. Baker made it clear that she was going to pay for the\n\n\fcar Miss Hetherington whose travelling allowance was dwindling\nin an alarming manner accepted with avidity.",
    "Hilary after inquiry\nat the desk was supplied with a guide and set forth to see the city\nof Fez.",
    "They started from the terrace going down through the succession\nof terraced gardens until they reached an enormous door in the\nwall at the bottom.",
    "The guide produced a key of mammoth\nproportions unlocked the door which swung slowly open and\nmotioned Hilary to pass through.",
    "It was like stepping into another world.",
    "All about her were the walls\nof Old Fez.",
    "Narrow winding streets high walls and occasionally\nthrough a doorway a glimpse of an interior or a courtyard and\nmoving all around her were laden donkeys men with their burdens\nboys women veiled and unveiled the whole busy secret life of this\nMoorish city.",
    "Wandering through the narrow streets she forgot\neverything else her mission the past tragedy of her life even\nherself.",
    "She was all eyes and ears living and walking in a dream world.",
    "The\nonly annoyance was the guide who talked unceasingly and urged\nher into various establishments into which she had no particular\nwish to go.",
    "You look lady.",
    "This man have very nice things very cheap really\nold really Moorish.",
    "He have gowns and silks.",
    "You like very nice\nbeads\n\n\fThe eternal commerce of East selling to West went on but it hardly\ndisturbed the charm for Hilary.",
    "She soon lost all sense of place or\ndirection.",
    "Here within this walled city she had little idea of whether\nshe was walking north or south or whether she were retracing her\nsteps over the same streets through which she had already passed.",
    "She was quite exhausted when the guide made his final suggestion\nwhich was evidently part of the routine.",
    "I take you very nice house now very superior.",
    "Friends of mine.",
    "You have mint tea there and they show you plenty lovely things.",
    "Hilary recognised the wellknown gambit which Mrs. Calvin Baker\nhad described.",
    "However she was willing to see or be taken to see\nanything that was suggested.",
    "Tomorrow she promised herself she\nwould come into the Old City alone and wander around without a\nguide chattering by her elbow.",
    "So she allowed herself to be guided\nthrough a gateway and up a winding path climbing up more or less\noutside the city walls.",
    "They arrived at last at a garden surrounding\nan attractive house built in native style.",
    "Here in a big room with a fine view out over the city she was urged\nto sit down at a small coffee table.",
    "In due course glasses of mint tea were brought.",
    "To Hilary who did\nnot like sugar with her tea it was somewhat of an ordeal to drink it.",
    "But by banishing the idea of tea from her mind and merely thinking\nof it as a new kind of lemonade she managed almost to enjoy it.",
    "She enjoyed too being shown rugs and beads and draperies\nembroideries and various other things.",
    "She made one or two small\n\n\fpurchases more out of good manners than for any other reason.",
    "The indefatigable guide then said\n\nI have car ready now and take you very nice short drive.",
    "One hour\nnot more see very beautiful scenery and country.",
    "And then back to\nhotel.",
    "He added assuming a suitably discreet expression This\ngirl here she take you first to very nice ladies toilet.",
    "The girl who had served the tea was standing by them smiling and\nsaid at once in careful English\n\nYes yes Madame.",
    "You come with me.",
    "We have very fine toilet oh\nvery fine.",
    "Just like the Ritz Hotel.",
    "Same as in New York or Chicago.",
    "You see\n\nSmiling a little Hilary followed the girl.",
    "The toilet hardly rose to the\nheights claimed for it but it did at least have running water.",
    "There\nwas a wash basin and a small cracked mirror which had such\ndistorting proportions that Hilary almost shrank back in alarm at\nthe sight of her own face.",
    "When she had washed and dried her\nhands which she did on her own handkerchief not much caring for\nthe appearance of the towel she turned to leave.",
    "In some way however the door of the toilet appeared to have\nstuck.",
    "She turned and rattled the handle unavailingly.",
    "It would not\nmove.",
    "Hilary wondered whether it had been bolted or locked from\nthe outside.",
    "She grew angry.",
    "What was the idea of shutting her in\nthere Then she noticed that there was another door in a corner of\nthe room.",
    "Going to it she turned the handle.",
    "This time the door\nopened easily enough.",
    "She passed through.",
    "She found herself in a small eastern looking room with light that\ncame only from slits high in the wall.",
    "Sitting there on a low divan\nsmoking was the little Frenchman she had met in the train M. Henri\nLaurier.",
    "II\n\nHe did not rise to greet her.",
    "He merely said and the timbre of his\nvoice was slightly changed\n\nGood afternoon Mrs. Betterton.",
    "For a moment Hilary stood motionless.",
    "Astonishment held her in its\ngrip.",
    "So this  was it She pulled herself together.",
    "This is what\nyouve been expecting.",
    "Act as you think she would act.",
    "She came\nforward and said eagerly\n\nYou have news for me You can help me\n\nHe nodded then said reproachfully\n\nI found you.",
    "Madame somewhat obtuse upon the train.",
    "Perhaps\nyou are too well accustomed to talk of the weather.",
    "The weather She stared at him bewildered.",
    "What had he said about weather on the train Cold Fog Snow\n\n\fSnow.",
    "That was what Olive Betterton had whispered as she lay\ndying.",
    "And she had quoted a silly little jingle  what was it\n\nSnow snow beautiful snow.",
    "You slip on a lump and over you go.",
    "Hilary repeated it falteringly now.",
    "Exactly  why did you not respond with that immediately as\nordered\n\nYou dont understand.",
    "I have been ill.",
    "I was in a plane crash and\nafterwards in hospital with concussion.",
    "Its affected my memory in\nall sorts of ways.",
    "Everything long ago is clear enough but there are\nterrible blanks  great gaps.",
    "She let her hands rise to her head.",
    "She found it easy enough to go on with a real tremor in her voice.",
    "You cant understand how frightening that is.",
    "I keep feeling that\nIve forgotten important things  really important things.",
    "The more I\ntry to get them back the less they will come.",
    "Yes said Laurier the airplane crash was unfortunate.",
    "He spoke\nin a cold businesslike way.",
    "It is going to be a question of whether\nyou have the necessary stamina and courage to continue your\njourney.",
    "Of course Im going to continue my journey cried Hilary.",
    "My\nhusband  her voice broke.",
    "He smiled but not a very pleasant smile.",
    "Faintly catlike.",
    "Your husband he said is I understand awaiting you with\neagerness.",
    "Hilarys voice broke.",
    "You have no idea she said.",
    "no idea what its been like these\nmonths since he went away.",
    "Do you think the British authorities came to a definite conclusion\nas to what you did or did not know\n\nHilary stretched out her hands with a wide gesture.",
    "How do I know  how can I tell They seemed satisfied.",
    "All the same... he stopped.",
    "I think it quite possible said Hilary slowly that I have been\nfollowed here.",
    "I cant pick out any one particular person but I have\nhad the feeling ever since I left England that I am under\nobservation.",
    "Naturally said Laurier coldly.",
    "We expected no less.",
    "I thought I ought to warn you.",
    "My dear Mrs. Betterton we are not children.",
    "We understand what\nwe are doing.",
    "Im sorry said Hilary humbly.",
    "Im afraid Im very ignorant.",
    "It does not matter if you are ignorant so long as you are obedient.",
    "I shall be obedient said Hilary in a low voice.",
    "You were closely watched in England I have no doubt ever since\nthe day of your husbands departure.",
    "Nevertheless the message\ncame to you did it not\n\nYes said Hilary.",
    "Now said Laurier in a businesslike manner I will give you your\ninstructions Madame.",
    "Please do.",
    "From here you will proceed to Marrakesh the day after tomorrow.",
    "That is as you planned and in accordance with your reservations.",
    "Yes.",
    "The day after you arrive there you will receive a telegram from\nEngland.",
    "What it will say I do not know but it will be sufficient for\nyou to make plans immediately to return to England.",
    "I am to return to England\n\nPlease listen.",
    "I have not finished.",
    "You will book a seat on a plane\nleaving Casablanca the following day.",
    "Supposing I cannot get reservations  supposing the seats are all\nbooked\n\nThey will not be all booked.",
    "Everything is arranged for.",
    "Now you\nunderstand your instructions\n\nI understand.",
    "Then please return to where your guide is waiting.",
    "You have been\nlong enough in this ladies toilet.",
    "By the way you have become\nfriendly with an American woman and an English woman who are\nnow staying at the Palais Jamail\n\nYes.",
    "Has that been a mistake It has been difficult to avoid.",
    "Not at all.",
    "It suits our plans admirably.",
    "If you can persuade one or\nother of them to accompany you to Marrakesh so much the better.",
    "Goodbye Madame.",
    "Au revoir Monsieur.",
    "It is unlikely Monsieur Laurier told her with a complete lack of\ninterest that I shall meet you again.",
    "Hilary retraced her steps to the ladies toilet.",
    "This time she found\nthe other door unfastened.",
    "A few minutes later she had rejoined the\nguide in the tea room.",
    "I got very nice car waiting said the guide.",
    "I take you now for\nvery pleasant instructive drive.",
    "The expedition proceeded according to plan.",
    "III\n\nSo\n\nyoure\n\nleaving\n\nfor\n\nMarrakesh\n\ntomorrow\n\nsaid\n\nMiss\n\nHetherington.",
    "You havent made a very long stay in Fez have you\nWouldnt it have been much easier to go to Marrakesh first and then\nto Fez returning to Casablanca afterwards\n\nI suppose it would really said Hilary but reservations are rather\ndifficult to obtain.",
    "Its pretty crowded here.",
    "Not\n\nwith English people\n\nsaid Miss Hetherington rather\n\ndisconsolately.",
    "It really seems dreadful nowadays the way one\nmeets hardly any of ones fellow countrymen.",
    "She looked round\nher disparagingly and said Its all the French.",
    "Hilary smiled faintly.",
    "The fact that Morocco was a French colonial\npossession did not seem to count much with Miss Hetherington.",
    "Hotels anywhere abroad she regarded as the prerogative of the\nEnglish travelling public.",
    "The French and the Germans and the Greeks said Mrs. Calvin\nBaker with a little cackle of laughter.",
    "That scruffy little old man is\na Greek I believe.",
    "I was told he was Greek said Hilary.",
    "Looks like a person of importance said Mrs. Baker.",
    "You see how\nthe waiters fly about for him.",
    "They give the English hardly any attention nowadays said Miss\nHetherington gloomily.",
    "They always give them the most terrible\nback bedrooms  the ones maids and valets used to have in the old\ndays.",
    "Well I cant say Ive found any fault with the accommodation Ive\nhad since I came to Morocco said Mrs. Calvin Baker.",
    "Ive\nmanaged to get a most comfortable room and bath every time.",
    "Youre an American said Miss Hetherington sharply and with\nsome venom in her voice.",
    "She clicked her knitting needles\nfuriously.",
    "I wish I could persuade you two to come to Marrakesh with me\nsaid Hilary.",
    "Its been so pleasant meeting you and talking to you\nhere.",
    "Really its very lonely travelling all by oneself.",
    "Ive been to Marrakesh said Miss Hetherington in a shocked\nvoice.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker however appeared to be somewhat sold on the\nidea.",
    "Well it certainly is an idea she said.",
    "Its over a month since I\nwas in Marrakesh.",
    "Id be glad to go there again for a spell and I\ncould show you around too Mrs. Betterton and prevent you being\nimposed upon.",
    "Its not until youve been to a place and looked\naround it that you learn the ropes.",
    "I wonder now.",
    "Ill go to the office\nand see what I can fix up.",
    "Miss Hetherington said acidly when she had departed\n\nThats exactly like these American women.",
    "Rushing from place to\nplace never settling down anywhere.",
    "Egypt one day Palestine the\nnext.",
    "Sometimes I really dont think they know what country theyre\nin.",
    "She shut her lips with a snap and rising and gathering up her\nknitting carefully she left the Turkish room with a little nod to Hilary\nas she went.",
    "Hilary glanced down at her watch.",
    "She felt inclined not\nto change this evening for dinner as she usually did.",
    "She sat on\nthere alone in the low rather dark room with its Oriental hangings.",
    "A waiter looked in then went away after turning on two lamps.",
    "They\ndid not give out very much light and the room seemed pleasantly\ndim.",
    "It had an Eastern sort of serenity.",
    "Hilary sat back on the low\ndivan thinking of the future.",
    "Only yesterday she had been wondering if the whole business upon\nwhich she had been engaged was a mares nest.",
    "And now  now she\nwas on the point of starting on her real journey.",
    "She must be\n\n\fcareful very careful.",
    "She must make no slip.",
    "She must be Olive\nBetterton moderately well educated inartistic conventional but\nwith definite Left Wing sympathies and a woman who was devoted\nto her husband.",
    "I must make no mistake said Hilary to herself under her breath.",
    "How strange it felt to be sitting here alone in Morocco.",
    "She felt as\nthough she had got into a land of mystery and enchantment.",
    "That\ndim lamp beside her If she were to take the carved brass between\nher hands and rub would a Djin of the Lamp appear As the\nthought came to her she started.",
    "Materialising quite suddenly from\nbeyond the lamp she saw the small wrinkled face and pointed\nbeard of M. Aristides.",
    "He bowed politely before sitting down beside\nher saying\n\nYou permit Madame\n\nHilary responded politely.",
    "Taking out his cigarette case he offered her a cigarette.",
    "She\naccepted and he lit one himself also.",
    "It pleases you this country Madame he asked after a moment or\ntwo.",
    "I have been here only a very short time said Hilary.",
    "I find it so far\nquite enchanting.",
    "Ah.",
    "And you have been into the old city You liked it\n\n\fI think it is wonderful.",
    "Yes it is wonderful.",
    "It is the past there  the past of commerce of\nintrigue of whispering voices shuttered activities all the mystery\nand passion of a city enclosed in its narrow streets and walls.",
    "Do\nyou know what I think of Madame when I walk through the streets\nof Fez\n\nNo\n\nI think of your Great West Road in London.",
    "I think of your great\nfactory buildings on each side of the road.",
    "I think of those buildings\nlit throughout with their neon lighting and the people inside that\nyou see so clearly from the road as you drive along in your car.",
    "There is nothing hidden there is nothing mysterious.",
    "There are not\neven curtains to the windows.",
    "No they do their work there with the\nwhole world observing them if it wants to do so.",
    "It is like slicing off\nthe top of an anthill.",
    "You mean said Hilary interested that it is the contrast that\ninterests you\n\nM. Aristides nodded his elderly tortoise like head.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "There everything is in the open and in the old\nstreets of Fez nothing is a jour.",
    "Everything is hidden dark...",
    "But \nhe leant forward and tapped a finger on the little brass coffee table\n but the same things go on.",
    "The same cruelties the same\n\n\foppressions the same wish for power the same bargaining and\nhaggling.",
    "You think that human nature is the same everywhere Hilary\nasked.",
    "In every country.",
    "In the past as in the present there are always the\ntwo things that rule.",
    "Cruelty and benevolence One or the other.",
    "Sometimes both.",
    "He continued with hardly a change of manner\nThey have told me Madame that you were in a very bad airplane\naccident the other day at Casablanca\n\nYes that is true.",
    "I envy you M. Aristides said unexpectedly.",
    "Hilary looked at him in an astonished manner.",
    "Again he waggled his\nhead in vehement assertion.",
    "Yes he added you are to be envied.",
    "You have had an\nexperience.",
    "I should like the experience of having come so near to\ndeath.",
    "To have that yet survive  do you not feel yourself different\nsince then Madame\n\nIn a rather unfortunate way said Hilary.",
    "I had concussion and\nthat gives me very bad headaches and it also affects my memory.",
    "Those are mere inconveniences said M. Aristides with a wave of\nthe hand but it is an adventure of the spirit you have passed\nthrough is it not\n\n\fIt is true said Hilary slowly that I have passed through an\nadventure of the spirit.",
    "She was thinking of a bottle of Vichy water and a little heap of\nsleeping pills.",
    "I have never had that experience said M. Aristides in his\ndissatisfied voice.",
    "So many other things but not that.",
    "He rose bowed said Mes homages Madame and left her.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nHow alike Hilary thought to herself all airports were They had a\nstrange anonymity about them.",
    "They were all at some distance from\nthe town or city they served and in consequence you had a queer\nstateless feeling of existing nowhere.",
    "You could fly from London to\nMadrid to Rome to Istanbul to Cairo to anywhere you liked and if\nyour journey was a through one by air you would never have the\nfaintest idea of what any of these cities looked like If you caught a\nglimpse of them from the air they were only a kind of glorified map\nsomething built with a childs box of bricks.",
    "And why she thought vexedly looking round her does one always\nhave to be at these places so much too early\n\n\fThey had spent nearly half an hour in the waiting room.",
    "Mrs. Calvin\nBaker who had decided to accompany Hilary to Marrakesh had\nbeen talking nonstop ever since their arrival.",
    "Hilary had answered\nalmost mechanically.",
    "But now she realised that the flow had been\ndiverted.",
    "Mrs. Baker had now switched her attention to two other\ntravellers who were sitting near her.",
    "They were both tall fair young\nmen.",
    "One an American with a broad friendly grin the other a\nrather solemn looking Dane or Norwegian.",
    "The Dane talked heavily\nslowly and rather pedantically in careful English.",
    "The American\nwas clearly delighted to find another American traveller.",
    "Presently\nin conscientious fashion Mrs. Calvin Baker turned to Hilary.",
    "Mr  Id like to have you know my friend Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Andrew Peters  Andy to my friends.",
    "The other young man rose to his feet bowed rather stiffly and said\nTorquil Ericsson.",
    "So now were all acquainted said Mrs. Baker happily.",
    "Are we all\ngoing to Marrakesh Its my friends first visit there \n\nI too said Ericsson.",
    "I too for the first time go.",
    "That goes for me too said Peters.",
    "The loud speaker was suddenly switched on and a hoarse\nannouncement in French was made.",
    "The words were barely\ndistinguishable but it appeared to be their summons to the plane.",
    "There were four passengers besides Mrs. Baker and Hilary.",
    "Besides Peters and Ericsson there was a thin tall Frenchman and\na severelooking nun.",
    "It was a clear sunny day and flying conditions were good.",
    "Leaning\nback in her seat with half closed eyes Hilary studied her fellow\npassengers seeking to distract herself that way from the anxious\nquestionings which were going on in her mind.",
    "One seat ahead of her on the other side of the aisle Mrs. Calvin\nBaker in her grey travelling costume looked like a plump and\ncontented duck.",
    "A small hat with wings was perched on her blue\nhair and she was turning the pages of a glossy magazine.",
    "Occasionally she leaned forward to tap the shoulder of the man\nsitting in front of her who was the cheerfullooking fair young\nAmerican Peters.",
    "When she did so he turned round displaying his\ngoodhumoured grin and responding energetically to her remarks.",
    "How very good natured and friendly Americans were Hilary\nthought to herself.",
    "So different from the stiff travelling English.",
    "She\ncould not imagine Miss Hetherington for instance falling into easy\nconversation with a young man even of her own nation on a plane\nand she doubted if the latter would have responded as goodnaturedly as this young American was doing.",
    "Across the aisle from her was the Norwegian Ericsson.",
    "As she caught his eye he made her a stiff little bow and leaning\nacross offered her his magazine which he was just closing.",
    "She\nthanked him and took it.",
    "In the seat behind him was the thin dark\n\n\fFrenchman.",
    "His legs were stretched out and he seemed to be\nasleep.",
    "Hilary turned her head over her shoulder.",
    "The severefaced nun\nwas sitting behind her and the nuns eyes impersonal incurious\nmet Hilarys with no expression in them.",
    "She sat immovable her\nhands clasped.",
    "It seemed to Hilary an odd trick of time that a\nwoman in traditional medieval costume should be travelling by air\nin the twentieth century.",
    "Six people thought Hilary travelling together for a few hours\ntravelling to different places with different aims scattering perhaps\nat the end of that few hours and never meeting again.",
    "She had read\na novel which had hinged on a similar theme and where the lives of\nthose six people were followed up.",
    "The Frenchman she thought\nmust be on a holiday.",
    "He seemed so tired.",
    "The young American was\nperhaps a student of some kind.",
    "Ericsson was perhaps going to\ntake up a job.",
    "The nun was doubtless bound for her convent.",
    "Hilary closed her eyes and forgot her fellow travellers.",
    "She puzzled\nas she had done all last night over the instructions that had been\ngiven her.",
    "She was to return to England It seemed crazy Or could\nit be that in some way she had been found wanting was not trusted\nhad failed to supply certain words or credentials that the real Olive\nwould have supplied.",
    "She sighed and moved restlessly.",
    "Well she\nthought I can do no more than I am doing.",
    "If Ive failed  Ive failed.",
    "At any rate Ive done my best.",
    "Then another thought struck her.",
    "Henri Laurier had accepted it as\nnatural and inevitable that a close watch was being kept upon her\n\n\fin Morocco  was this a means of disarming suspicion With the\nabrupt return of Mrs. Betterton to England it would surely be\nassumed that she had not come to Morocco in order to disappear\nlike her husband.",
    "Suspicion would relax  she would be regarded as\na bona fide traveller.",
    "She would leave for England going by Air France via Paris  and\nperhaps in Paris \n\nYes of course  in Paris.",
    "In Paris where Tom Betterton had\ndisappeared.",
    "How much easier to stage a disappearance there.",
    "Perhaps Tom Betterton had never left Paris.",
    "Perhaps  tired of\nprofitless speculation Hilary went to sleep.",
    "She woke  dozed again\noccasionally glancing without interest at the magazine she held.",
    "Awakening suddenly from a deeper sleep she noticed that the\nplane was rapidly losing height and circling round.",
    "She glanced at\nher watch but it was still some time earlier than the estimated time\nof arrival.",
    "Moreover looking down through the window she could\nnot see any signs of an aerodrome beneath.",
    "For a moment a faint qualm of apprehension struck her.",
    "The thin\ndark Frenchman rose yawned stretched his arms and looked out\nand said something in French which she did not catch.",
    "But Ericsson\nleant across the aisle and said\n\nWe are coming down here it seems  but why\n\nMrs. Calvin Baker leaning out of her seat turned her head and\nnodded brightly as Hilary said\n\n\fWe seem to be landing.",
    "The plane swooped round in ever lower circles.",
    "The country\nbeneath them seemed to be practically desert.",
    "There were no signs\nof houses or villages.",
    "The wheels touched with a decided bump\nbouncing along and taxiing until they finally stopped.",
    "It had been a\nsomewhat rough landing but it was a landing in the middle of\nnowhere.",
    "Had something gone wrong with the engine Hilary wondered or\nhad they run out of petrol The pilot a darkskinned handsome\nyoung man came through the forward door and along the plane.",
    "If you please he said you will all get out.",
    "He opened the rear door let down a short ladder and stood there\nwaiting for them all to pass out.",
    "They stood in a little group on the\nground shivering a little.",
    "It was chilly here with the wind blowing\nsharply from the mountains in the distance.",
    "The mountains Hilary\nnoticed were covered with snow and singularly beautiful.",
    "The air\nwas crisply cold and intoxicating.",
    "The pilot descended too and\naddressed them speaking French\n\nYou are all here Yes Excuse please you will have to wait a little\nminute perhaps.",
    "Ah no I see it is arriving.",
    "He pointed to where a small dot on the horizon was gradually\ngrowing nearer.",
    "Hilary said in a slightly bewildered voice\n\n\fBut why have we come down here What is the matter How long\nshall we have to be here\n\nThe French traveller said\n\nThere is I understand a station wagon arriving.",
    "We shall go on in\nthat.",
    "Did the engine fail asked Hilary.",
    "Andy Peters smiled cheerfully.",
    "Why no I shouldnt say so.",
    "he said the engine sounded all right\nto me.",
    "However theyll fix up something of that kind no doubt.",
    "She stared puzzled.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker murmured\n\nMy but its chilly standing about here.",
    "Thats the worst of this\nclimate.",
    "It seems so sunny but its cold the moment you get near\nsunset.",
    "The pilot was murmuring under his breath swearing Hilary\nthought.",
    "He was saying something like\n\nToujours des retards insupportables.",
    "The station wagon came towards them at a breakneck pace.",
    "The\nBerber driver drew up with a grinding of brakes.",
    "He sprang down\nand was immediately engaged by the pilot in angry conversation.",
    "Rather to Hilarys surprise Mrs. Baker intervened in the dispute speaking in French.",
    "Dont waste time she said peremptorily.",
    "Whats the good of\narguing We want to get out of here.",
    "The driver shrugged his shoulders and going to the station wagon\nhe unhitched the back part of it which let down.",
    "Inside was a large\npacking case.",
    "Together with the pilot and with help from Ericsson\nand Peters they got it down on to the ground.",
    "From the effort it\ntook it seemed to be heavy.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker put her hand on\nHilarys arm and said as the man began to raise the lid of the case\n\nI shouldnt watch my dear.",
    "Its never a pretty sight.",
    "She led Hilary a little way away on the other side of the wagon.",
    "The\nFrenchman and Peters came with them.",
    "The Frenchman said in his\nown language\n\nWhat is it then this manoeuvre there that they do\n\nMrs. Baker said\n\nYou are Dr. Barron\n\nThe Frenchman bowed.",
    "Pleased to meet you said Mrs. Baker.",
    "She stretched out her\nhand rather like a hostess welcoming him to a party.",
    "Hilary said in\na bewildered tone\n\n\fBut I dont understand.",
    "What is in that case Why is it better not to\nlook\n\nAndy Peters looked down on her consideringly.",
    "He had a nice face\nHilary thought.",
    "Something square and dependable about it.",
    "He\nsaid\n\nI know what it is.",
    "The pilot told me.",
    "Its not very pretty perhaps but\nI guess its necessary.",
    "He added quietly There are bodies in\nthere.",
    "Bodies She stared at him.",
    "Oh they havent been murdered or anything he grinned\nreassuringly.",
    "They were obtained in a perfectly legitimate way for\nresearch  medical research you know.",
    "But Hilary still stared.",
    "I dont understand.",
    "Ah.",
    "You see Mrs. Betterton this is where the journey ends.",
    "One\njourney that is.",
    "Ends\n\nYes.",
    "Theyll arrange the bodies in that plane and then the pilot will\nfix things and presently as were driving away from here we shall\n\n\fsee in the distance the flames going up in the air.",
    "Another plane\nthat has crashed and come down in flames and no survivors\n\nBut why How fantastic\n\nBut surely  It was Dr. Barron now who spoke to her.",
    "But surely\nyou know where we are going\n\nMrs. Baker drawing near said cheerfully\n\nOf course she knows.",
    "But maybe she didnt expect it quite so\nsoon.",
    "Hilary said after a short bewildered pause\n\nBut you mean  all of us She looked round.",
    "Were fellow travellers said Peters gently.",
    "The young Norwegian nodding his head said with an almost\nfanatical enthusiasm\n\nYes we are all fellow travellers.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nThe pilot came up to them.",
    "You will start now please he said.",
    "As soon as possible.",
    "There is\nmuch to be done and we are late on schedule.",
    "Hilary recoiled for a moment.",
    "She put her hand nervously to her\nthroat.",
    "The pearl choker she was wearing broke under the strain of\nher fingers.",
    "She picked up the loose pearls and crammed them into\nher pocket.",
    "They all got into the station wagon.",
    "Hilary was on a long bench\ncrowded up with Peters on one side of her and Mrs. Baker the\nother.",
    "Turning her head towards the American woman Hilary said\n\nSo you  so you  are what you might call the liaison officer Mrs.\nBaker\n\nThat hits it off exactly.",
    "And though I say it myself Im well qualified.",
    "Nobody is surprised to find an American woman getting around and\ntravelling a lot.",
    "She was still plump and smiling but Hilary sensed or thought she\nsensed a difference.",
    "The slight fatuity and surface conventionality\nhad gone.",
    "This was an efficient probably ruthless woman.",
    "It will make a fine sensation in the headlines said Mrs. Baker.",
    "She\nlaughed with some enjoyment.",
    "You I mean my dear.",
    "Persistently\ndogged by illluck theyll say.",
    "First nearly losing your life in the\ncrash at Casablanca then being killed in this further disaster.",
    "Hilary realised suddenly the cleverness of the plan.",
    "These others she murmured.",
    "Are they who they say they are\n\nWhy yes.",
    "Dr. Barron is a bacteriologist I believe.",
    "Mr. Ericsson a\nvery brilliant young physicist Mr. Peters is a research chemist\nMiss Needheim of course isnt a nun shes an endocrinologist.",
    "Me\nas I say Im only the liaison officer.",
    "I dont belong in this scientific\nbunch.",
    "She laughed again as she said That Hetherington woman\nnever had a chance.",
    "Miss Hetherington  was she  was she \n\nMrs. Baker nodded emphatically.",
    "If you ask me shes been tailing you.",
    "Took over in Casablanca\nfrom whoever followed you out.",
    "But she didnt come with us today although I urged her to\n\nThat wouldnt have been in character said Mrs. Baker.",
    "It would\nhave looked a little too obvious to go back again to Marrakesh after\nhaving been there already.",
    "No shell have sent a telegram or a\nphone message through and therell be someone waiting at\nMarrakesh to pick you up when you arrive.",
    "When you arrive Thats\na good laugh isnt it Look Look there now Up she goes.",
    "They had been driving rapidly away across the desert and now as\nHilary craned forward to look through the little window she saw a\ngreat glow behind them.",
    "A faint sound of an explosion came to her\nears.",
    "Peters threw his head back and laughed.",
    "He said\n\n\fSix people die when plane to Marrakesh crashes\n\nHilary said almost under her breath\n\nIts  its rather frightening.",
    "Stepping off into the unknown It was Peters who spoke.",
    "He was\nserious enough now.",
    "Yes but its the only way.",
    "Were leaving the\nPast and stepping out towards the Future.",
    "His face lit up with\nsudden enthusiasm.",
    "Weve got to get quit of all the bad mad old\nstuff.",
    "Corrupt governments and the warmongers.",
    "Weve got to go\ninto the new world  the world of science clean away from the scum\nand the driftwood.",
    "Hilary drew a deep breath.",
    "Thats like the things my husband used to say she said\ndeliberately.",
    "Your husband He shot her a quick glance.",
    "Why was he Tom\nBetterton\n\nHilary nodded.",
    "Well thats great.",
    "I never knew him out in the States though I\nnearly met him more than once.",
    "ZE Fission is one of the most\nbrilliant discoveries of this age  yes I certainly take my hat off to\nhim.",
    "Worked with old Mannheim didnt he\n\nYes said Hilary.",
    "Didnt they tell me hed married Mannheims daughter.",
    "But surely\nyoure not \n\nIm his second wife said Hilary flushing a little.",
    "He  his  Elsa\ndied in America.",
    "I remember.",
    "Then he went to Britain to work there.",
    "Then he riled\nthem by disappearing.",
    "He laughed suddenly.",
    "Walked slap out of\nsome Paris Conference into nowhere.",
    "He added as though in\nfurther appreciation Lord you cant say they dont organise well.",
    "Hilary agreed with him.",
    "The excellence of their organisation was\nsending a cold pang of apprehension through her.",
    "All the plans\ncodes signs that had been so elaborately arranged were going to\nbe useless now for now there would be no trail to pick up.",
    "Things\nhad been so arranged that everyone on the fatal plane had been\nfellow travellers bound for the Unknown Destination where Thomas\nBetterton had gone before them.",
    "There would be no trace left.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Nothing but a burntout plane.",
    "Could they  was it possible\nthat Jessop and his organisation could guess that she Hilary was\nnot one of those charred bodies She doubted it.",
    "The accident had\nbeen so convincing so clever  there would even be charred bodies\nin the plane.",
    "Peters spoke again.",
    "His voice was boyish with enthusiasm.",
    "For him\nthere were no qualms no looking back only eagerness to go\nforward.",
    "I wonder he said where do we go from here\n\n\fHilary too wondered because again much depended on that.",
    "Sooner or later there must be contacts with humanity.",
    "Sooner or\nlater if investigation was made the fact that a station wagon with\nsix people in it resembling the description of those who had left that\nmorning by plane might possibly be noted by someone.",
    "She turned\nto Mrs. Baker and asked trying to make her tone the counterpart\nof the childish eagerness of the young American beside her\n\nWhere are we going  what happens next\n\nYoull see said Mrs. Baker and for all the pleasantness of her\nvoice there was something somehow ominous in those words.",
    "They drove on.",
    "Behind them the flare of the plane still showed in the\nsky showed all the more clearly because the sun was now\ndropping below the horizon.",
    "Night fell.",
    "Still they drove.",
    "The going\nwas bad since they were obviously not on any main road.",
    "Sometimes they seemed to be on field tracks at other times they\ndrove over open country.",
    "For\n\na\n\nlong\n\ntime\n\nHilary\n\nremained\n\nawake\n\nthoughts\n\nand\n\napprehensions turning round in her head excitedly.",
    "But at last\nshaken and tossed from side to side exhaustion had its way and\nshe fell asleep.",
    "It was a broken sleep.",
    "Various ruts and jars in the\nroad awoke her.",
    "For a moment or two she would wonder confusedly\nwhere she was then reality would come back to her.",
    "She would\nremain awake for a few moments her thoughts racing round in\nconfused apprehension then once more her head would drop\nforward and nod and once again she would sleep.",
    "She was awakened suddenly by the car coming to an abrupt stop.",
    "Very gently Peters shook her by the arm.",
    "Wake up he said we seem to have arrived somewhere.",
    "Everyone got out of the station wagon.",
    "They were all cramped and\nweary.",
    "It was still dark and they seemed to have drawn up outside a\nhouse surrounded by palm trees.",
    "Some distance away they could\nsee a few dim lights as though there were a village there.",
    "Guided by\na lantern they were ushered into the house.",
    "It was a native house\nwith a couple of giggling Berber women who stared curiously at\nHilary and Mrs. Calvin Baker.",
    "They took no interest in the nun.",
    "The three women were taken to a small upstairs room.",
    "There were\nthree mattresses on the floor and some heaps of coverings but no\nother furniture.",
    "Ill say Im stiff said Mrs. Baker.",
    "Gets you kind of cramped riding\nalong the way weve been doing.",
    "Discomfort does not matter said the nun.",
    "She spoke with a harsh guttural assurance.",
    "Her English Hilary\nfound was good and fluent though her accent was bad.",
    "Youre living up to your part Miss Needheim said the American\nwoman.",
    "I can just see you in the convent kneeling on the hard\nstones at four in the morning.",
    "Miss Needheim smiled contemptuously.",
    "Christianity has made fools of women she said.",
    "Such a worship\nof weakness such snivelling humiliation Pagan women had\nstrength.",
    "They rejoiced and conquered And in order to conquer\nno discomfort is unbearable.",
    "Nothing is too much to suffer.",
    "Right now said Mrs. Baker yawning I wish I was in my bed at\nthe Palais Jamail at Fez.",
    "What about you Mrs. Betterton That\nshaking hasnt done your concussion any good Ill bet.",
    "No it hasnt Hilary said.",
    "Theyll bring us something to eat presently and then Ill fix you up\nwith some aspirin and youd better get to sleep as fast as you can.",
    "Steps were heard coming up the stairs outside and giggling female\nvoices.",
    "Presently the two Berber women came into the room.",
    "They\ncarried a tray with a big dish of semolina and meat stew.",
    "They put it\ndown on the floor came back again with a metal basin with water\nin it and a towel.",
    "One of them felt Hilarys coat passing the stuff\nbetween her fingers and speaking to the other woman who nodded\nher head in rapid agreement and did the same to Mrs. Baker.",
    "Neither of them paid any attention to the nun.",
    "Shoo said Mrs. Baker waving them away.",
    "Shoo shoo.",
    "It was exactly like shooing chickens.",
    "The women retreated still\nlaughing and left the room.",
    "Silly creatures said Mrs. Baker its hard to have patience with\nthem.",
    "I suppose babies and clothes are their only interest in life.",
    "It is all they are fit for said Fraulein Needheim they belong to a\nslave race.",
    "They are useful to serve their betters but no more.",
    "Arent you a little harsh said Hilary irritated by the womans\nattitude.",
    "I have no patience with sentimentality.",
    "There are those that rule\nthe few and there are the many that serve.",
    "But surely...\n\nMrs. Baker broke in in an authoritative manner.",
    "Weve all got our own ideas on these subjects I guess she said\nand very interesting they are.",
    "But this is hardly the time for them.",
    "Well want to get what rest we can.",
    "Mint tea arrived.",
    "Hilary swallowed some aspirin willingly enough\nsince her headache was quite a genuine one.",
    "Then the three\nwomen lay down on the mattresses and fell asleep.",
    "They slept late into the following day.",
    "They were not to go on again\nuntil the evening so Mrs. Baker informed them.",
    "From the room in\nwhich they had slept there was an outside staircase leading onto a\nflat roof where they had a certain amount of view over the\nsurrounding country.",
    "A little distance away was a village but here\n\n\fwhere they were the house was isolated in a large palm garden.",
    "On\nawakening Mrs. Baker had indicated three heaps of clothing which\nhad been brought and laid down just inside the door.",
    "Were going native for the next lap she explained we leave our\nother clothes here.",
    "So the smart little American womans neat suiting and Hilarys\ntweed coat and skirt and the nuns habit were all laid aside and\nthree native Moroccan women sat on the roof of the house and\nchatted together.",
    "The whole thing had a curiously unreal feeling.",
    "Hilary studied Miss Needheim more closely now that she had left\nthe anonymity of her nuns habit.",
    "She was a younger woman than\nHilary had thought her not more perhaps than thirtythree or\nthirtyfour.",
    "There was a neat spruceness in her appearance.",
    "The\npale skin the short stubby fingers and the cold eyes in which\nburned from time to time the gleam of the fanatic repelled rather\nthan attracted.",
    "Her speech was brusque and uncompromising.",
    "Towards both Mrs. Baker and Hilary she displayed a certain\namount of contempt as towards people unworthy to associate with\nher.",
    "This arrogance Hilary found very irritating.",
    "Mrs. Baker on the\nother hand seemed hardly to notice it.",
    "In a queer way Hilary felt far\nnearer and more in sympathy with the two giggling Berber women\nwho brought them food than with her two companions of the\nWestern world.",
    "The young German woman was obviously\nindifferent to the impression she created.",
    "There was a certain\nconcealed impatience in her manner and it was obvious that she\nwas longing to get on with her journey and that she had no interest\nin her two companions.",
    "Appraising Mrs. Bakers attitude Hilary found more difficult.",
    "At first\nMrs. Baker seemed a natural and normal person after the\ninhumanity of the German woman specialist.",
    "But as the sun sank\nlower in the sky she felt almost more intrigued and repelled by Mrs.\nBaker than by Helga Needheim.",
    "Mrs. Bakers social manner was\nalmost robotlike in its perfection.",
    "All her comments and remarks\nwere natural normal everyday currency but one had a suspicion\nthat the whole thing was like an actor playing a part for perhaps the\nseven\n\nhundredth\n\ntime.",
    "It\n\nwas\n\nan\n\nautomatic\n\nperformance\n\ncompletely divorced from what Mrs. Baker might really have been\nthinking or feeling.",
    "Who was Mrs. Calvin Baker Hilary wondered\nWhy had she come to play her part with such machinelike\nperfection Was she too a fanatic Had she dreams of a brave\nnew world  was she in violent revolt against the capitalist system\nHad she given up all normal life because of her political beliefs and\naspirations Impossible to tell.",
    "They resumed their journey that evening.",
    "It was no longer the\nstation wagon.",
    "This time it was an open touring car.",
    "Everyone was\nin native dress the men with white djellabos round them the\nwomen with their faces hidden.",
    "Packed tightly in they started off\nonce more driving all through the night.",
    "How are you feeling Mrs. Betterton\n\nHilary smiled up at Andy Peters.",
    "The sun had just risen and they\nhad stopped for breakfast.",
    "Native bread eggs and tea made over a\nprimus.",
    "I feel as though I were taking part in a dream said Hilary.",
    "Yes it has rather that quality.",
    "Where are we\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Who knows Our Mrs. Calvin Baker no doubt but no other.",
    "Its a very lonely country.",
    "Yes practically desert.",
    "But then it would have to be wouldnt it.",
    "You mean so as to leave no trace\n\nYes.",

    "The following day there is a\ntouring car full of Berbers one of the commonest sights on the road\nto be seen.",
    "For the next stage  he shrugged his shoulders  who\nknows\n\nBut where are we going\n\nAndy Peters shook his head.",
    "No use to ask.",
    "We shall find out.",
    "The Frenchman Dr. Barron had joined them.",
    "Yes he said we shall find out.",
    "But how true it is that we cannot\nbut ask That is our western blood.",
    "We can never say sufficient for\nthe day.",
    "It is always tomorrow tomorrow with us.",
    "To leave\nyesterday behind to proceed to tomorrow.",
    "That is what we\ndemand.",
    "You want to hurry the world on Doctor is that it asked Peters.",
    "There is so much to achieve said Dr. Barron life is too short.",
    "One must have more time.",
    "More time more time.",
    "He flung out his\nhands in a passionate gesture.",
    "Peters turned to Hilary.",
    "What are the four freedoms you talk about in your country\nFreedom from want freedom from fear...",
    "The Frenchman interrupted.",
    "Freedom from fools he said bitterly.",
    "That is what I want That is what my work needs.",
    "Freedom from\nincessant pettifogging economies Freedom from all the nagging\nrestrictions that hamper ones work\n\nYou are a bacteriologist are you not Dr. Barron\n\nYes I am a bacteriologist.",
    "Ah you have no idea my friend what a\nfascinating study that is But it needs patience infinite patience\n\n\frepeated experiment  and money  much money One must have\nequipment assistants raw materials Given that you have all you\nask for what can one not achieve\n\nHappiness asked Hilary.",
    "He flashed her a quick smile suddenly human again.",
    "Ah you are a woman Madame.",
    "It is women who ask always for\nhappiness.",
    "And seldom get it asked Hilary.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders.",
    "That may be.",
    "Individual happiness does not matter said Peters seriously\nthere must be the happiness of all the brotherhood of the spirit\nThe workers free and united owning the means of production free\nof the warmongers of the greedy insatiable men who keep\neverything in their own hands.",
    "Science is for all and must not be\nheld jealously by one power or the other.",
    "So said Ericsson appreciatively you are right.",
    "The scientists\nmust be masters.",
    "They must control and rule.",
    "They and they alone\nare the Supermen.",
    "It is only the Supermen who matter.",
    "The slaves\nmust be well treated but they are slaves.",
    "Hilary walked a little way away from the group.",
    "After a minute or\ntwo Peters followed her.",
    "You look just a little scared he said humourously.",
    "I think I am.",
    "She gave a short breathless laugh.",
    "Of course what\nDr. Barron said was quite true.",
    "Im only a woman.",
    "Im not a scientist\nI dont do research or surgery or bacteriology.",
    "I havent I suppose\nmuch mental ability.",
    "Im looking as Dr. Barron said for happiness just like any other fool of a woman.",
    "And whats wrong with that said Peters.",
    "Well maybe I feel a little out of my depth in this company.",
    "You see\nIm just a woman whos going to join her husband.",
    "Good enough said Peters.",
    "You represent the fundamental.",
    "Its nice of you to put it that way.",
    "Well its true.",
    "He added in a lower voice You care for your\nhusband very much\n\nWould I be here if I didnt\n\nI suppose not.",
    "You share his views I take it that hes a\nCommunist\n\nHilary avoided giving a direct answer.",
    "Talking of being a Communist she said has something about\nour little group struck you as curious\n\nWhats that\n\nWell that although were all bound for the same destination the\nviews of our fellow travellers dont seem really alike.",
    "Peters said thoughtfully\n\nWhy no.",
    "Youve got something there.",
    "I hadnt thought of it quite\nthat way  but I believe youre right.",
    "I dont think said Hilary that Dr. Barron is politically minded at\nall He wants money for his experiments.",
    "Helga Needheim talks like\na Fascist not a Communist.",
    "And Ericsson \n\nWhat about Ericsson\n\nI find him frightening  hes got a dangerous kind of singlemindedness.",
    "Hes like a mad scientist in a film\n\nAnd I believe in the Brotherhood of men and youre a loving wife\nand our Mrs. Calvin Baker  where would you place her\n\nI dont know.",
    "I find her more hard to place than anyone.",
    "Oh I wouldnt say that.",
    "Id say she was easy enough.",
    "How do you mean\n\n\fId say it was money all the way with her.",
    "Shes just a wellpaid cog\nin the wheel.",
    "She frightens me too said Hilary.",
    "Why Why on earth does she frighten you No touch of the mad\nscientist about her.",
    "She frightens me because shes so ordinary.",
    "You know just like\nanybody else.",
    "And yet shes mixed up in all this.",
    "Peters said grimly\n\nThe Party is realistic you know.",
    "It employs the best man or woman\nfor the job.",
    "But is someone who only wants money the best person for the job\nMightnt they desert to the other side\n\nThat would be a very big risk to take said Peters quietly.",
    "Mrs.\nCalvin Bakers a shrewd woman.",
    "I dont think shed take that risk.",
    "Hilary shivered suddenly.",
    "Cold\n\nYes.",
    "It is a bit cold.",
    "Lets move around a little.",
    "They walked up and down.",
    "As they did so Peters stooped and\npicked up something.",
    "Here.",
    "Youre dropping things.",
    "Hilary took it from him.",
    "Oh yes its a pearl from my choker.",
    "I broke it the other day  no\nyesterday.",
    "What ages ago that seems already.",
    "Not real pearls I hope.",
    "Hilary smiled.",
    "No of course not.",
    "Costume jewellery.",
    "Peters took a cigarette case from his pocket.",
    "Costume jewellery he said what a term\n\nHe offered her a cigarette.",
    "It does sound foolish  here.",
    "She took a cigarette.",
    "What an odd\ncase.",
    "How heavy it is.",
    "Made of lead thats why.",
    "Its a war souvenir  made out of a bit of a\nbomb that just failed to blow me up.",
    "You were  in the war then\n\n\fI was one of the backroom boys who tickled things to see if theyd\ngo bang.",
    "Dont lets talk about wars.",
    "Lets concentrate on\ntomorrow.",
    "Where are we going asked Hilary.",
    "Nobodys told me anything.",
    "Are we \n\nHe stopped her.",
    "Speculations he said are not encouraged.",
    "You go where youre\ntold and do what youre told.",
    "With sudden passion Hilary said\n\nDo you like being dragooned being ordered about having no say\nof your own\n\nIm prepared to accept it if its necessary.",
    "And it is necessary.",
    "Weve got to have World Peace World Discipline World Order.",
    "Is it possible Can it be got\n\nAnythings better than the muddle we live in.",
    "Dont you agree to\nthat\n\nFor a moment carried away by fatigue by the loneliness of her\nsurroundings and the strange beauty of the early morning light\nHilary nearly burst out into a passionate denial.",
    "She wanted to say\n\nWhy do you decry the world we live in There are good people in it.",
    "Isnt muddle a better breeding ground for kindliness and\nindividuality than a world order thats imposed a world order that\nmay be right today and wrong tomorrow I would rather have a\nworld of kindly faulty human beings than a world of superior\nrobots whove said goodbye to pity and understanding and\nsympathy.",
    "But she restrained herself in time.",
    "She said instead with a\ndeliberate subdued enthusiasm\n\nHow right you are.",
    "I was tired.",
    "We must obey and go forward.",
    "He grinned.",
    "Thats better.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nA dream journey.",
    "So it seemed more so every day.",
    "It was as\nthough Hilary felt she had been travelling all her life with these five\nstrangely assorted companions.",
    "They had stepped off from the\nbeaten track into the void.",
    "In one sense this journey of theirs could\nnot be called a flight.",
    "They were all she supposed free agents\nfree that is to go where they chose.",
    "As far as she knew they had\ncommitted no crime they were not wanted by the police.",
    "Yet great\n\n\fpains had been taken to hide their tracks.",
    "Sometimes she\nwondered why this was since they were not fugitives.",
    "It was as\nthough they were in process of becoming not themselves but\nsomeone else.",
    "That indeed was literally true in her case.",
    "She who had left England\nas Hilary Craven had become Olive Betterton and perhaps her\nstrange feeling of unreality had something to do with that.",
    "Every\nday the glib political slogans seemed to come more easily to her\nlips.",
    "She felt herself becoming earnest and intense and that again\nshe put down to the influence of her companions.",
    "She knew now that she was afraid of them.",
    "She had never before\nspent any time in close intimacy with people of genius.",
    "This was\ngenius at close quarters and genius had that something above\nnormal in it that was a great strain upon the ordinary mind and\nfeeling.",
    "All five were different from each other yet each had that\ncurious quality of burning intensity the singlemindedness of\npurpose that made such a terrifying impression.",
    "She did not know\nwhether it were a quality of brain or rather a quality of outlook of\nintensity.",
    "But each of them she thought was in his or her way a\npassionate idealist.",
    "To Dr. Barron life was a passionate desire to be\nonce more in his laboratory to be able to calculate and experiment\nand work with unlimited money and unlimited resources.",
    "To work\nfor what She doubted if he ever put that question to himself.",
    "He\nspoke to her once of the powers of destruction that he could let\nloose on a vast continent which could be contained in one little\nphial.",
    "She had said to him\n\nBut could you ever do that Actually really do it\n\n\fAnd he replied looking at her with faint surprise\n\nYes.",
    "Yes of course if it became necessary.",
    "He had said it in a merely perfunctory fashion.",
    "He had gone on\n\nIt would be amazingly interesting to see the exact course the\nexact progress.",
    "And he had added with a deep half sigh You see\ntheres so much more to know so much more to find out.",
    "For a moment Hilary understood.",
    "For a moment she stood where he\nstood impregnated with that single hearted desire for knowledge\nwhich swept aside life and death for millions of human beings as\nessentially unimportant.",
    "It was a point of view and in a way a not\nignoble one.",
    "Towards Helga Needheim she felt more antagonistic.",
    "The young womans superb arrogance revolted her.",
    "Peters she\nliked but was from time to time repulsed and frightened by the\nsudden fanatical gleam in his eye.",
    "She said to him once\n\nIt is not a new world you want to create.",
    "It is destroying the old one\nthat you will enjoy.",
    "Youre wrong Olive.",
    "What a thing to say.",
    "No Im not wrong.",
    "Theres hate in you.",
    "I can feel it.",
    "Hate.",
    "The wish\nto destroy.",
    "Ericsson she found the most puzzling of all.",
    "Ericsson she thought\nwas a dreamer less practical than the Frenchman further removed\n\n\ffrom destructive passion than the American.",
    "He had the strange\nfanatical idealism of the Norseman.",
    "We must conquer he said we must conquer the world.",
    "Then we\ncan rule.",
    "We she asked.",
    "He nodded his face strange and gentle with a deceptive mildness\nabout the eyes.",
    "Yes he said we few who count.",
    "The brains.",
    "That is all that\nmatters.",
    "Hilary thought where are we going Where is all this leading.",
    "These people are mad but theyre not mad in the same way as each\nother.",
    "Its as though they were all going towards different goals\ndifferent mirages.",
    "Yes that was the word.",
    "Mirages.",
    "And from them\nshe turned to a contemplation of Mrs. Calvin Baker.",
    "Here there was\nno fanaticism no hate no dream no arrogance no aspiration.",
    "There was nothing here that Hilary could find or take notice of.",
    "She\nwas a woman Hilary thought without either heart or conscience.",
    "She was the efficient instrument in the hands of a big unknown\nforce.",
    "It was the end of the third day.",
    "They had come to a small town and\nalighted at a small native hotel.",
    "Here Hilary found they were to\nresume European clothing.",
    "She slept that night in a small bare\nwhitewashed room rather like a cell.",
    "At early dawn Mrs. Baker\nwoke her.",
    "Were going off right now said Mrs. Baker.",
    "The planes waiting.",
    "The plane\n\nWhy yes my dear.",
    "Were returning to civilised travelling thank the\nLord.",
    "They came to the airfield and the plane after about an hours drive.",
    "It looked like a disused army airfield.",
    "The pilot was a Frenchman.",
    "They flew for some hours their flight taking them over mountains\nlooking down from the plane Hilary thought what a curious\nsameness the world has seen from above.",
    "Mountains valleys\nroads houses.",
    "Unless one was really an aerial expert all places\nlooked alike.",
    "That in some the population was denser than in\nothers was about all that one could say.",
    "And half of the time one\nsaw nothing owing to travelling over clouds.",
    "In the early afternoon they began to lose height and circle down.",
    "They were in mountainous country still but coming down in a flat\nplain.",
    "There was a wellmarked aerodrome here and a white\nbuilding beside it.",
    "They made a perfect landing.",
    "Mrs. Baker led the way towards the building.",
    "Beside it were two\npowerful cars with chauffeurs standing by them.",
    "It was clearly a\nprivate aerodrome of some kind since there appeared to be no\nofficial reception.",
    "Journeys end said Mrs. Baker cheerfully.",
    "We all go in and have\na good wash and brush up.",
    "And then the cars will be ready.",
    "Journeys end Hilary stared at her.",
    "But weve not  we havent\ncrossed the sea at all.",
    "Did you expect to Mrs. Baker seemed amused.",
    "Hilary said\nconfusedly\n\nWell yes.",
    "Yes I did.",
    "I thought... She stopped.",
    "Mrs. Baker nodded her head.",
    "Why so do a lot of people.",
    "Theres a lot of nonsense talked about\nthe iron curtain but what I say is an iron curtain can be anywhere.",
    "People dont think of that.",
    "Two Berber servants received them.",
    "After a wash and freshening\nup they sat down to coffee and sandwiches and biscuits.",
    "Then Mrs.\nBaker glanced at her watch.",
    "Well so long folks she said.",
    "This is where I leave you.",
    "Are you going back to Morocco asked Hilary surprised.",
    "That wouldnt quite do said Mrs. Calvin Baker with me being\nsupposed to be burnt up in a plane accident No I shall be on a\ndifferent run this time.",
    "But someone might still recognise you said Hilary.",
    "Someone I\nmean whod met you in hotels in Casablanca or Fez.",
    "Ah said Mrs. Baker but theyd be making a mistake.",
    "Ive got a\ndifferent passport now though its true enough that a sister of\nmine a Mrs. Calvin Baker lost her life that way.",
    "My sister and I are\nsupposed to be very alike.",
    "She added And to the casual people\none comes across in hotels one travelling American woman is very\nlike another.",
    "Yes Hilary thought that was true enough.",
    "All the outer\nunimportant characteristics were present in Mrs. Baker.",
    "The\nneatness the trimness the carefully arranged blue hair the highly\nmonotonous prattling voice.",
    "Inner characteristics she realised\nwere carefully masked or indeed absent.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker\npresented to the world and to her companions a fa\u0437ade but what\nwas behind the facade was not easy to fathom.",
    "It was as though she\nhad deliberately extinguished those tokens of individuality by which\none personality is distinguishable from another.",
    "Hilary felt moved to say so.",
    "She and Mrs. Baker were standing a\nlittle apart from the rest.",
    "One doesnt know said Hilary in the least what youre really\nlike\n\nWhy should you\n\nYes.",
    "Why should I And yet you know I feel I ought to.",
    "Weve\ntravelled together in rather intimate circumstances and it seems\nodd to me that I know nothing about you.",
    "Nothing I mean of the\nessential you of what you feel and think of what you like and\ndislike of whats important to you and what isnt.",
    "Youve such a probing mind my dear said Mrs. Baker.",
    "If youll\ntake my advice youll curb that tendency.",
    "I dont even know what part of the United States you come from.",
    "That doesnt matter either.",
    "Ive finished with my own country.",
    "There are reasons why I can never go back there.",
    "If I can pay off a\ngrudge against that country Ill enjoy doing it.",
    "For just a second or two malevolence showed both in her\nexpression and in the tone of her voice.",
    "Then it relaxed once more\ninto cheerful tourist tones.",
    "Well so long Mrs. Betterton I hope you have a very agreeable\nreunion with your husband.",
    "Hilary said helplessly\n\nI dont even know where I am what part of the world I mean.",
    "Oh thats easy.",
    "There needs to be no concealment about that now.",
    "A remote spot in the High Atlas my dear.",
    "Thats near enough \n\nMrs. Baker moved away and started saying goodbye to the others.",
    "With a final gay wave of her hand she walked out across the\ntarmac.",
    "The plane had been refueled and the pilot was standing\nwaiting for her.",
    "A faint cold chill went over Hilary.",
    "Here she felt\nwas her last link with the outside world.",
    "Peters standing near her\nseemed to sense her reaction.",
    "The place of no return he said softly.",
    "Thats us I guess.",
    "Dr. Barron said softly\n\nHave you still courage Madame or do you at this moment want to\nrun after your American friend and climb with her into the plane and\ngo back  back to the world you have left\n\nCould I go if I wanted to asked Hilary.",
    "The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.",
    "One wonders.",
    "Shall I call to her asked Andy Peters.",
    "Of course not said Hilary sharply.",
    "Helga Needheim said scornfully\n\nThere is no room here for women who are weaklings.",
    "She is not a weakling said Dr. Barron softly but she asks herself\nquestions as any intelligent woman would do.",
    "He stressed the\nword intelligent as though it were a reflection upon the German\nwoman.",
    "She however was unaffected by his tone.",
    "She despised all\nFrenchmen and was happily assured of her own worth.",
    "Ericsson\nsaid in his high nervous voice\n\n\fWhen one has at last reached freedom can one even contemplate\ngoing back\n\nHilary said\n\nBut if it is not possible to go back or to choose to go back then it\nis not freedom\n\nOne of the servants came to them and said\n\nIf you please the cars are ready now to start.",
    "They went out through the opposite door of the building.",
    "Two\nCadillac cars were standing there with uniformed chauffeurs.",
    "Hilary indicated a preference for sitting in front with the chauffeur.",
    "She explained the swinging motion of a large car occasionally made\nher feel car sick.",
    "This explanation seemed to be accepted easily\nenough.",
    "As they drove along Hilary made a little desultory\nconversation from time to time.",
    "The weather the excellence of the\ncar.",
    "She spoke French quite easily and well and the chauffeur\nresponded agreeably.",
    "His manner was entirely natural and matter\nof fact.",
    "How long will it take us she asked presently.",
    "From the aerodrome to the hospital It is a drive of perhaps two\nhours Madame.",
    "The words struck Hilary with faintly disagreeable surprise.",
    "She had\nnoted without thinking much about it that Helga Needheim had\n\n\fchanged at the rest house and was now wearing a hospital nurses\nkit.",
    "This fitted in.",
    "Tell me something about the hospital she said to the chauffeur.",
    "His reply was enthusiastic.",
    "Ah Madame it is magnificent.",
    "The equipment it is the most uptodate in the world.",
    "Many doctors come and visit it and all of them go\naway full of praise.",
    "It is a great thing that is being done there for\nhumanity.",
    "It must be said Hilary yes yes indeed it must.",
    "These miserable ones said the chauffeur they have been sent in\nthe past to perish miserably on a lonely island.",
    "But here this new\ntreatment of Dr. Kolinis cures a very high percentage.",
    "Even those\nwho are far gone.",
    "It seems a lonely place to have a hospital said Hilary.",
    "Ah\n\nMadame\n\nbut\n\nyou\n\nwould\n\nhave\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nlonely\n\nin\n\nthe\n\ncircumstances.",
    "The authorities would insist upon it.",
    "But it is good\nair here wonderful air.",
    "See Madame you can see now where we\nare going.",
    "He pointed.",
    "They were approaching the first spurs of a mountain range and on\nthe side of it set flat against the hillside was a long gleaming white\nbuilding.",
    "What an achievement said the chauffeur to raise such a\nbuilding out here.",
    "The money spent must have been fantastic.",
    "We\nowe much Madame to the rich philanthropists of this world.",
    "They\nare not like governments who do things always in a cheap way.",
    "Here money has been spent like water.",
    "Our patron he is one of the\nrichest men in the world they say.",
    "Here truly he has built a\nmagnificent achievement for the relief of human suffering.",
    "He drove up a winding track.",
    "Finally they came to rest outside great\nbarred iron gates.",
    "You must dismount here Madame said the chauffeur.",
    "It is not\npermitted that I take the car through these gates.",
    "The garages are\na kilometre away.",
    "The travellers got out of the car.",
    "There was a big bell pull at the\ngate but before they could touch it the gates swung slowly open.",
    "A\nwhiterobed figure with a black smiling face bowed to them and\nbade them enter.",
    "They passed through the gate at one side\nscreened by a high fence of wire there was a big courtyard where\nmen were walking up and down.",
    "As these men turned to look at the\narrivals Hilary uttered a gasp of horror.",
    "But theyre lepers she exclaimed.",
    "Lepers\n\nA shiver of horror shook her entire frame.",
    "Chapter 11\n\n\fThe gates of the leper colony closed behind the travellers with a\nmetallic clang.",
    "The noise struck on Hilarys startled consciousness\nwith a horrible note of finality.",
    "Abandon hope it seemed to say all\nye who enter here...",
    "This she thought was the end... really the end.",
    "Any way of retreat there might have been was now cut off.",
    "She was alone now amongst enemies and in at most a very few\nminutes she would be confronted with discovery and failure.",
    "Subconsciously she supposed she had known that all day but\nsome undefeatable optimism of the human spirit some persistence\nin the belief that that entity oneself could not possibly cease to\nexist had been masking that fact from her.",
    "She had said to Jessop\nin Casablanca And when do I reach Tom Betterton and he had\nsaid then gravely that that was when the danger would become\nacute.",
    "He had added that he hoped that by then he might be in a\nposition to give her protection but that hope Hilary could not but\nrealise had failed to materialise.",
    "If Miss Hetherington had been the agent on whom Jessop was\nrelying Miss Hetherington had been outmanoeuvred and left to\nconfess failure at Marrakesh.",
    "But in any case what could Miss\nHetherington have done\n\nThe party of travellers had arrived at the place of no return.",
    "Hilary\nhad gambled with death and lost.",
    "And she knew now that Jessops\ndiagnosis had been correct.",
    "She no longer wanted to die.",
    "She\nwanted to live.",
    "The zest of living had come back to her in full\nstrength.",
    "She could think of Nigel of the little mound that was\n\n\fBrendas grave with a sad wondering pity but no longer with the\ncold lifeless despair that had urged her on to seek oblivion in death.",
    "She thought Im alive again sane whole... and now Im like a rat in\na trap.",
    "If only there were some way out...",
    "It was not that she had given no thought to the problem.",
    "She had.",
    "But it seemed to her reluctantly that once confronted with\nBetterton there could be no way out...\n\nBetterton would say But thats not my wife  And that would be\nthat Eyes turning towards her... realisation... a spy in their midst...\n\nBecause what other solution could there be Supposing she were\nto get in first Supposing she were to cry out before Tom Betterton\ncould get in a word  Who are you Youre not my husband If she\ncould simulate indignation shock horror sufficiently well  might it\njust credibly raise a doubt A doubt whether Betterton was\nBetterton  or some other scientist sent to impersonate him.",
    "A spy\nin other words.",
    "But if they believed that then it might be rather\nhard on Betterton But she thought her mind turning in tired\ncircles if Betterton was a traitor a man willing to sell his countrys\nsecrets could anything be hard on him How difficult it was she\nthought to make any appraisement of loyalties  or indeed any\njudgments of people or things... At any rate it might be worth trying.",
    "To create a doubt \n\nWith a giddy feeling she returned to her immediate surroundings.",
    "Her thoughts had been running underground with the frenzied\nviolence of a rat caught in a trap.",
    "But during that time her surface\nstream of consciousness had been playing its appointed part.",
    "The little party from the outside world had been welcomed by a big\nhandsome man  a linguist it would seem since he had said a word\nor two to each person in his or her own language.",
    "Enchant\u00e9 de faire votre connaisance mon cher doctor he was\nmurmuring to Dr. Barron and then turning to her\n\nAh Mrs. Betterton were very pleased to welcome you here.",
    "A\nlong confusing journey Im afraid.",
    "Your husbands very well and\nnaturally awaiting you with impatience.",
    "He gave her a discreet smile it was a smile she noticed that did\nnot touch his cold pale eyes.",
    "You must he added be longing to see him.",
    "The giddiness increased  she felt the group round her approaching\nand receding like the waves of the sea.",
    "Beside her Andy Peters put\nout an arm and steadied her.",
    "I guess you havent heard he said to their welcoming host.",
    "Mrs.\nBetterton had a bad crash at Casablanca  concussion.",
    "This\njourneys done her no good.",
    "Nor the excitement of looking forward\nto meeting her husband.",
    "Id say she ought to lie down right now in a\ndarkened room.",
    "Hilary felt the kindness of his voice of the supporting arm.",
    "She\nswayed a little more.",
    "It would be easy incredibly easy to crumple\nat the knees to drop flaccidly down... to feign unconsciousness  or\n\n\fat any rate near unconsciousness.",
    "To be laid on a bed in a\ndarkened room  to put off the moment of discovery just a little\nlonger...",
    "But Betterton would come to her there  any husband\nwould.",
    "He would come there and lean over the bed in the dim gloom\nand at the first murmur of her voice the first dim outline of her face\nas his eye became accustomed to the twilight he would realise that\nshe was not Olive Betterton.",
    "Courage came back to Hilary.",
    "She straightened up.",
    "Colour came\ninto her cheeks.",
    "She flung up her head.",
    "If this were to be the end let it be a gallant end She would go to\nBetterton and when he repudiated her she would try out the last\nlie come out with it confidently fearlessly\n\nNo of course Im not your wife.",
    "Your wife  Im terribly sorry its\nawful  shes dead.",
    "I was in hospital with her when she died.",
    "I\npromised her Id get to you somehow and give you her last\nmessages.",
    "I wanted to.",
    "You see Im in sympathy with what you did with what all of you are doing.",
    "I agree with you politically.",
    "I want to\nhelp...",
    "Thin thin all very thin... And such awkward trifles to explain  the\nfaked passport  the forged letter of credit.",
    "Yes but people did get\nby sometimes with the most audacious lies  if one lied with\nsufficient confidence  if you had the personality to put a thing over.",
    "One could at any rate go down fighting.",
    "She drew herself up gently freeing herself from Peters support.",
    "Oh no.",
    "I must see Tom she said.",
    "I must go to him  now  at once\n please.",
    "The big man was hearty about it.",
    "Sympathetic.",
    "Though the cold\neyes were still pale and watchful.",
    "Of course of course Mrs. Betterton.",
    "I quite understand how you\nare feeling.",
    "Ah heres Miss Jennsen.",
    "A thin spectacled girl had joined them.",
    "Miss Jennsen meet Mrs. Betterton Fraulein Needheim.",
    "Dr.\nBarron Mr. Peters Dr. Ericsson.",
    "Show them into the Registry will\nyou Give them a drink.",
    "Ill be with you in a few minutes.",
    "Just take\nMrs. Betterton along to her husband.",
    "Ill be with you again shortly.",
    "He turned to Hilary again saying\n\nFollow me Mrs. Betterton.",
    "He strode forward she followed.",
    "At a bend in the passage she\ngave a last look over her shoulder.",
    "Andy Peters was still watching\nher.",
    "He had a faintly puzzled unhappy look  she thought for a\nmoment he was going to come with her.",
    "He must have realised she\nthought that theres something wrong realised it from me but he\ndoesnt know what it is.",
    "And she thought with a slight shiver Its the last time perhaps\nthat Ill ever see him...\n\n\fAnd so as she turned the corner after her guide she raised a hand\nand waved a goodbye...",
    "The big man was talking cheerfully.",
    "This way Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Im afraid youll find our buildings rather\nconfusing at first so many corridors and all rather alike.",
    "Like a dream.",
    "Hilary thought a dream of hygienic white corridors\nalong which you pass forever turning going on never finding your\nway out...\n\nShe said\n\nI didnt realise it would be a  a hospital.",
    "No no of course.",
    "You couldnt realise anything could you\n\nThere was a faint sadistic note of amusement in his voice.",
    "Youve had as they say to fly blind.",
    "My names Van Heidem by\nthe way.",
    "Paul Van Heidem.",
    "Its all a little strange  and rather terrifying said Hilary.",
    "The\nlepers...",
    "Yes yes of course.",
    "Picturesque  and usually so very unexpected.",
    "It does upset newcomers.",
    "But youll get used to them  oh yes youll\nget used to them in time.",
    "He gave a slight chuckle.",
    "A very good joke I always think myself.",
    "He paused suddenly.",
    "Up one flight of stairs  now dont hurry.",
    "Take it easy.",
    "Nearly there\nnow.",
    "Nearly there  nearly there... so many steps to death... up  up deep steps deeper than European steps.",
    "And now another of the\nhygienic passages and Van Heidem was stopping by a door.",
    "He\ntapped waited and then opened it.",
    "Ah Betterton  here we are at last.",
    "Your wife\n\nHe stood aside with a slight flourish.",
    "Hilary walked into the room.",
    "No holding back.",
    "No shrinking.",
    "Chin\nup.",
    "Forward to doom.",
    "A man stood half turned from the window an almost startlingly\ngoodlooking\n\nman.",
    "She\n\nnoted\n\nthat\n\nrecognising\n\nhis\n\nfair\n\nhandsomeness with a feeling almost of surprise.",
    "He wasnt\nsomehow her idea of Tom Betterton.",
    "Surely the photograph of him\nthat she had been shown wasnt in the least \n\nIt was that confused feeling of surprise that decided her.",
    "She would\ngo all out for her first desperate expedient.",
    "She made a quick movement forward then drew back.",
    "Her voice\nrang out startled dismayed...",
    "But  that isnt Tom.",
    "That isnt my husband...",
    "It was well done she felt it herself.",
    "Dramatic but not overdramatic\nHer eyes met Van Heidems in bewildered questioning.",
    "And then Tom Betterton laughed A quiet amused almost\ntriumphant laugh.",
    "Pretty good eh Van Heidem he said if even my own wife\ndoesnt know me\n\nWith four quick steps he had crossed to her and gathered her\ntightly into his arms.",
    "Olive darling.",
    "Of course you know me.",
    "Im Tom all right even if I\nhavent got quite the same face as I used to have.",
    "His face pressed against hers his lips by her ear she caught the\nfaint whispered addition.",
    "Play up.",
    "For Gods sake.",
    "Danger.",
    "He released her for a moment caught her to him again.",
    "Darling Its seemed years  years and years.",
    "But youre here at\nlast\n\n\fShe could feel the warning pressure of his fingers below her\nshoulder blades admonishing her giving their urgent message.",
    "Only after a moment or two did he release her push her a little from\nhim and look into her face.",
    "I still cant quite believe it he said with an excited little laugh.",
    "Still you know its me now dont you\n\nHis eyes burning into hers still held that message of warning.",
    "She didnt understand it  couldnt understand it.",
    "But it was a\nmiracle from heaven and she rallied to play her part.",
    "Tom she said and there was a catch in her voice that her\nlistening ears approved.",
    "Oh Tom  but what \n\nPlastic surgery Hertz of Vienna is here.",
    "And hes a living marvel.",
    "Dont say you regret my old crushed nose.",
    "He kissed her again lightly easily this time then turned to the\nwatching Van Heidem with a slight apologetic laugh.",
    "Forgive the transports Van he said.",
    "But naturally naturally  the Dutchman smiled benevolently.",
    "Its been so long said Hilary and I  she swayed a little I please can I sit down.",
    "Hurriedly Tom Betterton eased her into a chair.",
    "Of course darling.",
    "Youre all in.",
    "That frightful journey.",
    "And the\nplane accident.",
    "My God what an escape\n\nSo there was full communication.",
    "They knew all about the plane\ncrash.",
    "Its left me terribly woollyheaded said Hilary with an apologetic\nlittle laugh.",
    "I forget things and get muddled up and have awful\nheadaches.",
    "And then finding you looking like a total stranger Im a\nbit of a mess darling.",
    "I hope I wont be a bother to you\n\nYou a bother Never.",
    "Youll just have to take it easy for a bit thats\nall.",
    "Theres all the time in the world here.",
    "Van Heidem moved gently towards the door.",
    "I will leave you now he said.",
    "After a little you will bring your wife\nto the Registry Betterton For the moment you will like to be\nalone.",
    "He went out shutting the door behind him.",
    "Immediately Betterton dropped on his knees by Hilary and buried\nhis face on her shoulder.",
    "Darling darling he said.",
    "And once again she felt that warning pressure of the fingers.",
    "The\nwhisper so faint as hardly to be heard was urgent and insistent.",
    "Keep it up.",
    "There might be a microphone  one never knows.",
    "That was it of course.",
    "One never knew...",
    "Fear  uneasiness uncertainty  danger  always danger  she could feel it in the\natmosphere.",
    "Tom Betterton sat back on his haunches.",
    "Its so wonderful to see you he said softly.",
    "And yet you know\nits like a dream  not quite real.",
    "Do you feel like that too\n\nYes thats just it  a dream  being here  with you  at last.",
    "It\ndoesnt seem real Tom.",
    "She had placed both hands on his shoulders.",
    "She was looking at\nhim a faint smile on her lips.",
    "There might be a spy hole as well as a\nmicrophone.",
    "Coolly and calmly she appraised what she saw.",
    "A nervous goodlooking man of thirtyodd who was badly frightened  a man nearly\nat the end of his tether  a man who had presumably come here full\nof high hopes and had been reduced  to this.",
    "Now that she had surmounted her first hurdle Hilary felt a curious\nexhilaration in the playing of her part.",
    "She must be Olive Betterton.",
    "Act as Olive would have acted feel as Olive would have felt.",
    "And life\nwas so unreal that that seemed quite natural.",
    "Somebody called\n\n\fHilary Craven had died in an aeroplane accident.",
    "From now on she\nwouldnt even remember her.",
    "Instead she rallied her memories of the lessons she had studied so\nassiduously.",
    "It seems such ages since Firbank she said.",
    "Whiskers  you\nremember Whiskers She had kittens  just after you went away.",
    "There are so many things silly everyday little things you dont even\nknow about.",
    "Thats what seems so odd.",
    "I know.",
    "Its breaking with an old life and beginning a new one.",
    "And  its all right here Youre happy\n\nA necessary wifely question that any wife would ask.",
    "Its wonderful.",
    "Tom Betterton squared his shoulders threw his\nhead back.",
    "Unhappy frightened eyes looked out of a smiling\nconfident face.",
    "Every facility.",
    "No expense spared.",
    "Perfect\nconditions to get on with the job.",
    "And the organisation Its\nunbelievable.",
    "Oh Im sure it is.",
    "My journey  did you come the same way\n\nOne doesnt talk about that.",
    "Oh Im not snubbing you darling.",
    "But\n you see youve got to learn about everything.",
    "But the lepers Is it really a Leper Colony\n\n\fOh yes.",
    "Perfectly genuine.",
    "Theres a team of medicos doing very\nfine work in research on the subject.",
    "But its quite selfcontained.",
    "It\nneednt worry you.",
    "Its just  clever camouflage.",
    "I see.",
    "Hilary looked round her.",
    "Are these our quarters\n\nYes.",
    "Sitting room bathroom there bedroom beyond.",
    "Come Ill\nshow you.",
    "She got up and followed him through a wellappointed bathroom\ninto a goodsized bedroom with twin beds big builtin cupboards a\ndressing table and a bookshelf near the beds.",
    "Hilary looked into\nthe cupboard space with some amusement.",
    "I hardly know what Im going to put in here she remarked.",
    "All\nIve got is what I stand up in.",
    "Oh that.",
    "You can fit yourself out with all you want.",
    "Theres a\nfashion\n\nmodel\n\ndepartment\n\nand\n\nall\n\naccessories\n\ncosmetics\n\neverything.",
    "All first class.",
    "The Unit is quite selfcontained  all you\nwant on the premises.",
    "No need to go outside ever again.",
    "He said the words lightly but it seemed to Hilarys sensitive ear that\nthere was despair concealed behind the words.",
    "No need to go outside ever again.",
    "No chance of ever going outside\nagain.",
    "Abandon hope all ye who enter here...",
    "The wellappointed\ncage Was it for this she thought that all these varying\npersonalities had abandoned their countries their loyalties their\neveryday lives Dr. Barron Andy Peters young Ericsson with his\n\n\fdreaming face the overbearing Helga Needheim Did they know\nwhat they were coming to find Would they be content Was this\nwhat they had wanted\n\nShe thought Id better not ask too many questions...",
    "If someone is\nlistening.",
    "Was someone listening Were they being spied upon Tom\nBetterton evidently thought it might be so.",
    "But was he right Or was\nit nerves  hysteria Tom Betterton she thought was very near to a\nbreakdown.",
    "Yes she thought grimly and so may you be my girl in six\nmonths time...\n\nWhat did it do to people she wondered living like this\n\nTom Betterton said to her\n\nWould you like to lie down  to rest\n\nNo  she hesitated.",
    "No I dont think so.",
    "Then perhaps youd better come with me to the Registry.",
    "Whats the Registry\n\nEveryone who clocks in goes through the Registry.",
    "They record\neverything about you.",
    "Health teeth blood pressure blood group\n\n\fpsychological reactions tastes dislikes allergies aptitudes\npreferences.",
    "It sounds very military  or do I mean medical\n\nBoth said Tom Betterton.",
    "Both.",
    "This organisation  its really\nformidable.",
    "Ones always heard so said Hilary.",
    "I mean that everything\nbehind the Iron Curtain is really properly planned.",
    "She tried to put a proper enthusiasm into her voice.",
    "After all Olive\nBetterton had presumably been a sympathiser with the Party\nalthough perhaps by order she had not been known to be a Party\nmember.",
    "Betterton said evasively\n\nTheres a lot for you to  understand.",
    "He added quickly Better\nnot try to take in too much at once.",
    "He kissed her again a curious apparently tender and even\npassionate kiss that was actually cold as ice murmured very low in\nher ear Keep it up and said aloud And now come down to the\nRegistry.",
    "Chapter 12\n\n\fThe registry was presided over by a woman who looked like a strict\nnursery governess.",
    "Her hair was rolled into a rather hideous bun\nand she wore some very efficientlooking pincenez.",
    "She nodded\napproval as the Bettertons entered the severe officelike room.",
    "Ah she said youve brought Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Her English was perfectly idiomatic but it was spoken with a stilted\nprecision which made Hilary believe that she was probably a\nforeigner.",
    "Actually her nationality was Swiss.",
    "She motioned Hilary\nto a chair opened a drawer beside her and took out a sheaf of\nforms upon which she commenced to write rapidly.",
    "Tom Betterton\nsaid rather awkwardly\n\nWell then Olive Ill leave you.",
    "Yes please Dr. Betterton.",
    "Its much better to get through all the\nformalities straight away.",
    "Betterton went out shutting the door behind him.",
    "The Robot for as\nsuch Hilary thought of her continued to write.",
    "Now then she said in a businesslike way.",
    "Full name please.",
    "Age.",
    "Where born.",
    "Fathers and mothers names.",
    "Any serious\nillnesses.",
    "Tastes.",
    "Hobbies.",
    "List of any jobs held.",
    "Degrees at any\nuniversity.",
    "Preferences in food and drink.",
    "It went on a seemingly endless catalogue.",
    "Hilary responded\nvaguely almost mechanically.",
    "She was glad now of the careful\npriming she had received from Jessop.",
    "She had mastered it all so\n\n\fwell that the responses came automatically without having to\npause or think.",
    "The Robot said finally as she made the last entry\n\nWell that seems to be all for this department.",
    "Now well hand you\nover to Doctor Schwartz for medical examination.",
    "Really said Hilary.",
    "Is all this necessary It seems most absurd.",
    "Oh we believe in being thorough Mrs. Betterton.",
    "We like to have\neverything down in the records.",
    "Youll like Dr. Schwartz very much.",
    "Then from her you go on to Doctor Rubec.",
    "Dr. Schwartz was fair and amiable and female.",
    "She gave Hilary a\nmeticulous physical examination and then said\n\nSo That is finished.",
    "Now you go to Dr. Rubec.",
    "Who is Dr. Rubec Hilary asked.",
    "Another doctor\n\nDr. Rubec is a psychologist.",
    "I dont want a psychologist.",
    "I dont like psychologists.",
    "Now please dont get upset Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Youre not going to\nhave treatment of any kind.",
    "Its simply a question of an intelligence\ntest and of your typegroup personality.",
    "Dr. Rubec was a tall melancholy Swiss of about forty years of age.",
    "He greeted Hilary glanced at the card that had been passed on to\nhim by Dr. Schwartz and nodded his head approvingly.",
    "Your health is good I am glad to see he said.",
    "You have had an\naeroplane crash recently I understand\n\nYes said Hilary.",
    "I was four or five days in hospital at\nCasablanca.",
    "Four or five days are not enough said Dr. Rubec reprovingly.",
    "You should have been there longer.",
    "I didnt want to be there longer.",
    "I wanted to get on with my\njourney.",
    "That of course is understandable but it is important with\nconcussion that plenty of rest should be had.",
    "You may appear quite\nwell and normal after it but it may have serious effects.",
    "Yes I see\nyour nerve reflexes are not quite what they should be.",
    "Partly the\nexcitement of the journey and partly no doubt due to concussion.",
    "Do you get headaches\n\nYes.",
    "Very bad headaches.",
    "And I get muddled up every now and\nthen and cant remember things.",
    "Hilary felt it well to continually stress this particular point.",
    "Dr.\nRubec nodded soothingly.",
    "Yes yes yes.",
    "But do not trouble yourself.",
    "All that will pass.",
    "Now\nwe will have a few association tests so as to decide what type of\nmentality you are.",
    "Hilary felt faintly nervous but all appeared to pass off well.",
    "The test\nseemed to be of a merely routine nature.",
    "Dr. Rubec made various\nentries on a long form.",
    "It is a pleasure he said at last to deal with someone if you will\nexcuse me Madame and not to take amiss what I am going to say\nto deal with someone who is not in any way a genius\n\nHilary laughed.",
    "Oh Im certainly not a genius she said.",
    "Fortunately for you said Dr. Rubec.",
    "I can assure you your\nexistence will be far more tranquil.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Here as you\nprobably understand I deal mostly with keen intellects but with the\ntype of sensitive intellect that is apt to become easily unbalanced\nand where the emotional stress is strong.",
    "The man of science\nMadame is not the cool calm individual he is made out to be in\nfiction.",
    "In fact said Dr. Rubec thoughtfully between a firstclass\ntennis player an operatic primadonna and a nuclear physicist\nthere is really very little difference as far as emotional instability\ngoes.",
    "Perhaps you are right said Hilary remembering that she was\nsupposed to have lived for some years in close proximity to\nscientists.",
    "Yes they are rather temperamental sometimes.",
    "Dr. Rubec threw up a pair of expressive hands.",
    "You would not believe he said the emotions that arise here The\nquarrels the jealousies the touchiness We have to take steps to\ndeal with all that.",
    "But you Madame he smiled.",
    "You are in a class\nthat is in a small minority here.",
    "A fortunate class if I may so express\nmyself.",
    "I dont quite understand you.",
    "What kind of a minority\n\nWives said Dr. Rubec.",
    "We have not many wives here.",
    "Very few\nare permitted.",
    "One finds them on the whole refreshingly free from\nthe brainstorms of their husbands and their husbands colleagues.",
    "What do wives do here asked Hilary.",
    "She added apologetically\nYou see its all so new to me.",
    "I dont understand anything yet.",
    "Naturally not.",
    "Naturally.",
    "That is bound to be the case.",
    "There are\nhobbies recreations amusements instructional courses.",
    "A wide\nfield.",
    "You will find it I hope an agreeable life.",
    "As you do\n\nIt was a question and rather an audacious one and Hilary\nwondered a moment or two later whether she had been wise to ask\nit.",
    "But Dr. Rubec merely seemed amused.",
    "You are quite right Madame he said.",
    "I find life here peaceful\nand interesting in the extreme.",
    "You dont ever regret  Switzerland\n\n\fI am not homesick.",
    "No.",
    "That is partly because in my case my\nhome conditions were bad.",
    "I had a wife and several children.",
    "I was\nnot cut out Madame to be a family man.",
    "Here conditions are\ninfinitely more pleasant.",
    "I have ample opportunity of studying\ncertain aspects of the human mind which interest me and on which\nI am writing a book.",
    "I have no domestic cares no distractions no\ninterruptions.",
    "It all suits me admirably.",
    "And where do I go next asked Hilary as he rose and shook her\ncourteously and formally by the hand.",
    "Mademoiselle La Roche will take you to the dress department.",
    "The\nresult I am sure  he bowed  will be admirable.",
    "After the severe Robotlike females she had met so far Hilary was\nagreeably surprised by Mademoiselle La Roche.",
    "Mademoiselle La\nRoche had been a vendeuse in one of the Paris houses of haute\ncouture and her manner was thrillingly feminine.",
    "I am delighted Madame to make your acquaintance.",
    "I hope that I\ncan be of assistance to you.",
    "Since you have just arrived and since\nyou are no doubt tired I would suggest that you select now just a\nfew essentials.",
    "Tomorrow and indeed during the course of next\nweek you can examine what we have in stock at your leisure.",
    "It is\ntiresome I always think to have to select things rapidly.",
    "It destroys\nall the pleasure of la toilette.",
    "So I would suggest if you agree just a\nset of underclothing a dinner dress and perhaps a tailor.",
    "How delightful it sounds said Hilary.",
    "I cannot tell you how odd it\nfeels to own nothing but a toothbrush and a sponge.",
    "Mademoiselle La Roche laughed cheeringly.",
    "She took a few rapid\nmeasures and led Hilary into a big apartment with builtin\ncupboards.",
    "There were clothes here of every description made of\ngood material and excellent cut and in a large variety of sizes.",
    "When Hilary had selected the essentials of la toilette they passed\non to the cosmetics department where Hilary made a selection of\npowders creams and various other toilet accessories.",
    "These were\nhanded to one of the assistants a native girl with a shining dark\nface dressed in spotless white and she was instructed to see that\nthey were delivered to Hilarys apartment.",
    "All these proceedings had seemed to Hilary more and more like a\ndream.",
    "And we shall have the pleasure of seeing you again shortly I\nhope said Mademoiselle La Roche gracefully.",
    "It will be a great\npleasure Madame to assist you to select from our models.",
    "Entre\nnous my work is sometimes disappointing.",
    "These scientific ladies\noften take very little interest in la toilette.",
    "In fact not half an hour\nago I had a fellow traveller of yours.",
    "Helga Needheim\n\nAh yes that was the name.",
    "She is of course a Boche and the\nBoches are not sympathetic to us.",
    "She is not actually bad looking if\nshe took a little care of her figure if she chose a flattering line she\ncould look very well.",
    "But no She has no interest in clothes.",
    "She is a\ndoctor I understand.",
    "A specialist of some kind.",
    "Let us hope she\n\n\ftakes more interest in her patients than she does in her toilette  Ah\nthat one what man will look at her twice\n\nMiss Jennsen the thin dark spectacled girl who had met the party\non arrival now entered the fashion salon.",
    "Have you finished here Mrs. Betterton she asked.",
    "Yes thank you said Hilary.",
    "Then perhaps you will come and see the Deputy Director.",
    "Hilary said au revoir to Mademoiselle La Roche and followed the\nearnest Miss Jennsen.",
    "Who is the Deputy Director she asked.",
    "Doctor Nielson.",
    "Everybody Hilary reflected in this place was doctor of something.",
    "Who exactly is Doctor Nielson she asked.",
    "Medical scientific\nwhat\n\nOh hes not medical Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Hes in charge of\nAdministration.",
    "All complaints have to go to him.",
    "Hes the\nadministrative head of the Unit.",
    "He always has an interview with\neveryone when they arrive.",
    "After that I dont suppose youll ever\nsee him again unless something very important should arise.",
    "I see said Hilary meekly.",
    "She had an amused feeling of having\nbeen put severely in her place.",
    "Admission to Dr. Nielson was through two antechambers where\nstenographers were working.",
    "She and her guide were finally\nadmitted into the inner sanctum where Dr. Nielson rose from\nbehind a large executives desk.",
    "He was a big florid man with an\nurbane manner.",
    "Of transAtlantic origin Hilary thought though he\nhad very little American accent.",
    "Ah he said rising and coming forward to shake Hilary by the\nhand.",
    "This is  yes  let me see  yes Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Delighted to\nwelcome you here Mrs. Betterton.",
    "We hope youll be very happy\nwith us.",
    "Sorry to hear of the unfortunate accident during the course\nof your journey but Im glad it was no worse.",
    "Yes you were lucky\nthere.",
    "Very lucky indeed.",
    "Well your husbands been awaiting you\nimpatiently and I hope now youve got here you will settle down and\nbe very happy amongst us.",
    "Thank you Dr. Nielson.",
    "Hilary sat down in the chair he drew forward for her.",
    "Any questions you want to ask me Dr. Nielson leant forward over\nhis desk in an encouraging manner.",
    "Hilary laughed a little.",
    "Thats a most difficult thing to answer she said.",
    "The real answer\nis of course that Ive got so many questions to ask that I dont\nknow where to begin.",
    "Quite quite.",
    "I understand that.",
    "If youll take my advice  this is just\nadvice you know nothing more  I shouldnt ask anything.",
    "Just\nadapt yourself and see what comes.",
    "Thats the best way believe\nme.",
    "I feel I know so little said Hilary.",
    "Its all so  so very unexpected.",
    "Yes.",
    "Most people think that.",
    "The general idea seems to have been\nthat one was going to arrive in Moscow.",
    "He laughed cheerfully.",
    "Our desert home is quite a surprise to most people.",
    "It was certainly a surprise to me.",
    "Well we dont tell people too much beforehand.",
    "They mightnt be\ndiscreet you know and discretions rather important.",
    "But youll be\ncomfortable here youll find.",
    "Anything you dont like  or\nparticularly would like to have... just put in a request for it and well\nsee what can be managed.",
    "Any artistic requirement for instance.",
    "Painting sculpture music we have a department for all that sort of\nthing.",
    "Im afraid Im not talented that way.",
    "Well theres plenty of social life too of a kind.",
    "Games you know.",
    "We have tennis courts squash courts.",
    "It takes a week or two we\noften find for people to find their feet especially the wives if I may\nsay so.",
    "Your husbands got his job and hes busy with it and it takes\na little time sometimes for the wives to find  well  other wives who\nare congenial.",
    "All that sort of thing.",
    "You understand me.",
    "But does one  does one  stay here\n\nStay here I dont quite understand you Mrs. Betterton.",
    "I mean does one stay here or go on somewhere else\n\nDr. Nielson became rather vague.",
    "Ah he said.",
    "That depends on your husband.",
    "Ah yes yes that\ndepends very much on him.",
    "There are possibilities.",
    "Various\npossibilities.",
    "But its better not to go into all that just now.",
    "Id\nsuggest you know that you  well  come and see me again\nperhaps in three weeks time.",
    "Tell me how youve settled down.",
    "All\nthat kind of thing.",
    "Does one  go out at all\n\nGo out Mrs. Betterton\n\nI mean outside the walls.",
    "The gates.",
    "A very natural question said Dr. Nielson.",
    "His manner was now\nrather heavily beneficent.",
    "Yes very natural.",
    "Most people ask it\nwhen they come here.",
    "But the point of our Unit is that its a world in\nitself.",
    "There is nothing if I may so express myself to go out to.",
    "Outside us there is only desert.",
    "Now Im not blaming you Mrs.\nBetterton.",
    "Most people feel like that when they first get here.",
    "Slight\nclaustrophobia.",
    "Thats how Dr. Rubec puts it.",
    "But I assure you that\nit passes off.",
    "Its a hangover if I may so express it from the world\nthat you have left.",
    "Have you ever observed an ant hill Mrs.\n\n\fBetterton An interesting sight.",
    "Very interesting and very\ninstructive.",
    "Hundreds of little black insects hurrying to and fro so\nearnest so eager so purposeful.",
    "And yet the whole things such a\nmuddle.",
    "Thats the bad old world you have left.",
    "Here there is\nleisure purpose infinite time.",
    "I assure you he smiled an earthly\nparadise.",
    "Chapter 13\n\nIts like a school said Hilary.",
    "She was back once more in her own suite.",
    "The clothes and\naccessories she had chosen were awaiting her in the bedroom.",
    "She\nhung the clothes in the cupboard and arranged the other things to\nher liking.",
    "I know said Betterton I felt like that at first.",
    "Their conversation was wary and slightly stilted.",
    "The shadow of a\npossible microphone still hung over them.",
    "He said in an oblique\nmanner\n\nI think its all right you know.",
    "I think I was probably imagining\nthings.",
    "But all the same...",
    "He left it at that and Hilary realised that what he had left unsaid\nwas but all the same we had better be careful.",
    "The whole business was Hilary thought like some fantastic\nnightmare.",
    "Here she was sharing a bedroom with a strange man\nand yet so strong was the feeling of uncertainty and danger that to\nneither of them did the intimacy appear embarrassing.",
    "It was like\nshe thought climbing a Swiss mountain where you share a hut in\nclose proximity with guides and other climbers as a matter of\ncourse.",
    "After a minute or two Betterton said\n\nIt all takes a bit of getting used to you know.",
    "Lets just be very\nnatural.",
    "Very ordinary.",
    "More or less as if we were at home still.",
    "She realised the wisdom of that.",
    "The feeling of unreality persisted\nand would persist she supposed some little time.",
    "The reasons for\nBetterton leaving England his hopes his disillusionment could not\nbe touched upon between them at this moment.",
    "They were two\npeople playing a part with an undefined menace hanging over them\nas it were.",
    "She said presently\n\nI was taken through a lot of formalities.",
    "Medical psychological and\nall that.",
    "Yes.",
    "Thats always done.",
    "Its natural I suppose.",
    "Did the same\nhappen to you\n\nMore or less.",
    "Then I went in to see the  Deputy Director I think they called him\n\nThats right.",
    "He runs this place.",
    "Very capable and a thoroughly\ngood administrator.",
    "But hes not really the head of it all\n\nOh no theres the Director himself.",
    "Does one  do I  shall I see the Director\n\nSooner or later I expect.",
    "But he doesnt often appear.",
    "He gives us\nan address from time to time  hes got a wonderfully stimulating\npersonality.",
    "There was a faint frown between Bettertons brows and Hilary\nthought it wise to abandon the subject.",
    "Betterton said glancing at a\nwatch\n\nDinner is at eight.",
    "Eight to eightthirty that is.",
    "Wed better be\ngetting down if youre ready\n\nHe spoke exactly as though they were staying in a hotel.",
    "Hilary had changed into the dress she had selected.",
    "A soft shade of\ngraygreen that made a good background for her red hair.",
    "She\nclasped a necklace of rather attractive costume jewellery round\nher neck and said she was ready.",
    "They went down the stairs and\nalong corridors and finally into a large dining room.",
    "Miss Jennsen\ncame forward and met them.",
    "I have arranged a slightly larger table for you Tom she said to\nBetterton.",
    "A couple of your wifes fellow travellers will sit with you and the Murchisons of course.",
    "They went along to the table indicated.",
    "The room contained mostly\nsmall tables seating four eight or ten persons.",
    "Andy Peters and\nEricsson were already sitting at the table and rose as Hilary and\nTom approached.",
    "Hilary introduced her husband to the two men.",
    "They sat down and presently they were joined by another couple.",
    "These Betterton introduced as Dr. and Mrs. Murchison.",
    "Simon and I work in the same lab he said in an explanatory\nfashion.",
    "Simon Murchison was a thin anaemiclooking young man of about\ntwentysix.",
    "His wife was dark and stocky.",
    "She spoke with a strong\nforeign accent and was Hilary gathered an Italian.",
    "Her Christian\nname was Bianca.",
    "She greeted Hilary politely but or so it seemed\nto Hilary with a certain reserve.",
    "Tomorrow she said I will show you around the place.",
    "You are\nnot a scientist no\n\nIm afraid said Hilary that I have had no scientific training.",
    "She\nadded I worked as a secretary before my marriage.",
    "Bianca has had legal training said her husband.",
    "She has studied\neconomics and commercial law.",
    "Sometimes she gives lectures here\nbut it is difficult to find enough to do to occupy ones time.",
    "Bianca shrugged her shoulders.",
    "I shall manage she said.",
    "After all Simon I came here to be with\nyou and I think that there is much here that could be better\norganised.",
    "I am studying conditions.",
    "Perhaps Mrs. Betterton since\nshe will not be engaged on scientific work can help me with these\nthings.",
    "Hilary hastened to agree to this plan.",
    "Andy Peters made them all\nlaugh by saying ruefully\n\nI guess I feel rather like a homesick little boy whos just gone to\nboarding school.",
    "Ill be glad to get down to doing some work.",
    "Its a wonderful place for working said Simon Murchison with\nenthusiasm.",
    "No interruptions and all the apparatus you want.",
    "Whats your line asked Andy Peters.",
    "Presently the three men were talking a jargon of their own which\nHilary found difficult to follow.",
    "She turned to Ericsson who was\nleaning back in his chair his eyes abstracted.",
    "And you she asked.",
    "Do you feel like a homesick little boy too\n\nHe looked at her as though from a long way away.",
    "I do not need a home he said.",
    "All these things home ties of\naffection parents children all these are a great hindrance.",
    "To\nwork one should be quite free.",
    "And you feel that you will be free here\n\n\fOne cannot tell yet.",
    "One hopes so.",
    "Bianca spoke to Hilary.",
    "After dinner she said there is a choice of many things to do.",
    "There is a card room and you can play bridge or there is a cinema\nor three nights a week theatrical performances are given and\noccasionally there is dancing.",
    "Ericsson frowned disapprovingly.",
    "All these things are unnecessary he said.",
    "They dissipate\nenergy.",
    "Not for us women said Bianca.",
    "For us women they are\nnecessary.",
    "He looked at her with an almost cold and impersonal dislike.",
    "Hilary thought To him women are unnecessary too.",
    "I shall go to bed early said Hilary.",
    "She yawned deliberately.",
    "I\ndont think I want to see a film or play bridge this evening.",
    "No dear said Tom Betterton hastily.",
    "Much better to go to bed\nreally early and have a good nights rest.",
    "Youve had a very tiring\njourney remember.",
    "As they rose from the table Betterton said\n\n\fThe air here is wonderful at night.",
    "We usually take a turn or two on\nthe roof garden after dinner before dispersing to recreations or\nstudy.",
    "Well go up there for a little and then youd better go to bed.",
    "They went up in a lift manned by a magnificentlooking native in\nwhite robes.",
    "The attendants were darkerskinned and of a more\nmassive build than the slighter Berbers  a desert type Hilary\nthought.",
    "She was startled by the unexpected beauty of the roof\ngarden and also by the lavish expenditure that must have gone to\ncreate it.",
    "Tons of earth must have been brought and carried up\nhere.",
    "The result was like an Arabian Nights fairy tale.",
    "There was the\nsplash of water tall palms the tropical leaves of bananas and other\nplants and paths of beautiful colored tiles with designs of Persian\nflowers.",
    "Its unbelievable said Hilary.",
    "Here in the middle of the desert.",
    "She spoke out what she had felt\n\nIts an Arabian Nights fairy tale.",
    "I agree with you Mrs. Betterton said Murchison.",
    "It looks exactly\nas though it has come into being by conjuring up a Djin Ah well  I\nsuppose even in the desert theres nothing you cant do given\nwater and money  plenty of both of them.",
    "Where does the water come from\n\nSpring tapped deep in the mountain.",
    "Thats the raison d\u043atre of the\nUnit.",
    "A fair sprinkling of people was on the roof garden but little by little\nthey dwindled away.",
    "The Murchisons excused themselves.",
    "They\nwere going to watch some ballet.",
    "There were few people left now.",
    "Betterton guided Hilary with his\nhand on her arm to a clear space near the parapet.",
    "The stars\nshowed above them and the air was cold now crisp and\nexhilarating.",
    "They were alone here.",
    "Hilary sat down on the low\nconcrete and Betterton stood in front of her.",
    "Now then he said in a low nervous voice Who the hell are you\n\nShe looked up at him for a moment or two without answering.",
    "Before she replied to his question there was something that she\nherself had got to know.",
    "Why did you recognise me as your wife she asked.",
    "They looked at each other.",
    "Neither of them wished to be the first to\nanswer the others question.",
    "It was a duel of wills between them\nbut Hilary knew that whatever Tom Betterton had been like when he\nleft England his will was now inferior to her own.",
    "She had arrived\nhere fresh in the selfconfidence of organising her own life  Tom\nBetterton had been living a planned existence.",
    "She was the\nstronger.",
    "He looked away from her at last and muttered sullenly\n\n\fIt was  just an impulse.",
    "I was probably a damned fool.",
    "I fancied\nthat you might have been sent  to get me out of here.",
    "You want to get out of here then\n\nMy God can you ask\n\nHow did you get here from Paris\n\nTom Betterton gave a short unhappy laugh.",
    "I wasnt kidnapped or anything like that if thats what you mean.",
    "I\ncame of my own free will under my own steam.",
    "I came keenly and\nenthusiastically.",
    "You knew that you were coming here\n\nId no idea I was coming to Africa if thats what you mean.",
    "I was\ncaught by the usual lure.",
    "Peace on earth free sharing of scientific\nsecrets amongst the scientists of the world suppression of\ncapitalists and warmongers  all the usual jargon That fellow\nPeters who came with you is the same hes swallowed the same\nbait.",
    "And when you got here  it wasnt like that\n\nAgain he gave that short bitter laugh.",
    "Youll see for yourself.",
    "Oh perhaps it is that more or less But its\nnot the way you thought it would be.",
    "Its not  freedom.",
    "He sat down beside her frowning to himself.",
    "Thats what got me down at home you know.",
    "The feeling of being\nwatched and spied upon.",
    "All the security precautions.",
    "Having to\naccount for ones actions for ones friends... All necessary I dare\nsay but it gets you down in the end... And so when someone comes\nalong with a proposition  well you listen...",
    "It all sounds fine...",
    "He\ngave a short laugh.",
    "And one ends up  here\n\nHilary said slowly\n\nYou mean youve come to exactly the same circumstances as\nthose from which you tried to escape Youre being watched and\nspied upon in just the same way  or worse\n\nBetterton pushed his hair back nervously from his forehead.",
    "I dont know he said.",
    "Honestly.",
    "I dont know.",
    "I cant be sure.",
    "It\nmay be all going on in my own mind.",
    "I dont know that Im being\nwatched at all.",
    "Why should I be Why should they bother Theyve\ngot me here  in prison.",
    "It isnt in the least as you imagined it\n\nThats the odd thing.",
    "I suppose it is in a way.",
    "The working\nconditions are perfect.",
    "Youve every facility every kind of\napparatus.",
    "You can work for as long a time as you like or as short a\ntime.",
    "Youve got every comfort and accessory.",
    "Food clothes living\nquarters but youre conscious all the time that youre in prison.",
    "I know.",
    "When the gates clanged behind us today as we came in it\nwas a horrible feeling.",
    "Hilary shuddered.",
    "Well Betterton seemed to pull himself together.",
    "Ive answered\nyour question.",
    "Now answer mine.",
    "What are you doing here\npretending to be Olive\n\nOlive  she stopped feeling for words.",
    "Yes What about Olive Whats happened to her What are you\ntrying to say\n\nShe looked with pity at his haggard nervous face.",
    "Ive been dreading having to tell you.",
    "You mean  somethings happened to her\n\nYes.",
    "Im sorry terribly sorry...",
    "Your wifes dead... She was coming\nto join you and the plane crashed.",
    "She was taken to hospital and\ndied two days later.",
    "He stared straight ahead of him.",
    "It was as though he was\ndetermined to show no emotion of any kind.",
    "He said quietly\n\nSo Olives dead I see...",
    "There was a long silence.",
    "Then he turned to her.",
    "All right.",
    "I can go on from there.",
    "You took her place and came\nhere why\n\nThis time Hilary was ready with her response.",
    "Tom Betterton had\nbelieved that she had been sent to get him out of here as he had\nput it.",
    "That was not the case.",
    "Hilarys position was that of a spy.",
    "She\nhad been sent to gain information not to plan the escape of a man\nwho had placed himself willingly in the position he now was.",
    "Moreover she could command no means of deliverance she was a\nprisoner as much as he was.",
    "To confide in him fully would she felt be dangerous.",
    "Betterton was\nvery near a breakdown.",
    "At any moment he might go completely to\npieces.",
    "In those circumstances it would be madness to expect him\nto keep a secret.",
    "She said\n\nI was in the hospital with your wife when she died.",
    "I offered to take\nher place and try and reach you.",
    "She wanted to get a message to\nyou very badly.",
    "He frowned.",
    "But surely \n\nShe hurried on  before he could realise the weakness of the tale.",
    "Its not so incredible as it sounds.",
    "You see I had a lot of sympathy\nwith all these ideas  the ideas youve just been talking about.",
    "Scientific secrets shared with all nations  a new World Order.",
    "I was\nenthusiastic about it all.",
    "And then my hair  if what they expected\nwas a redhaired woman of the right age I thought Id get through.",
    "It seemed worth trying anyway.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "His eyes swept over her head.",
    "Your hairs exactly\nlike Olives.",
    "And then you see your wife was so insistent  about the message\nshe wanted me to give to you.",
    "Oh yes the message.",
    "What message\n\nTo tell you to be careful  very careful  that you were in danger from someone called Boris\n\nBoris Boris Glydr do you mean\n\nYes do you know him\n\nHe shook his head.",
    "Ive never met him.",
    "But I know him by name.",
    "Hes a relation of my\nfirst wifes.",
    "I know about him.",
    "Why should he be dangerous\n\nWhat\n\nHe spoke absently.",
    "Hilary repeated her question.",
    "Oh that.",
    "He seemed to come back from far away.",
    "I dont know\nwhy he should be dangerous to me but its true that by all accounts\nhes a dangerous sort of chap.",
    "In what way\n\nWell hes one of those half balmy idealists who would quite happily\nkill off half humanity if they thought for some reason it would be a\ngood thing.",
    "I know the sort of person you mean.",
    "She felt she did know  vividly.",
    "But why\n\nHad Olive seen him What did he say to her\n\nI cant tell you.",
    "Thats all she said.",
    "About danger  oh yes she said\nshe couldnt believe it.",
    "Believe what\n\nI dont know.",
    "She hesitated a minute and then said You see  she\nwas dying...\n\nA spasm of pain convulsed his face.",
    "I know...",
    "I know...",
    "I shall get used to it in time.",
    "At the moment I\ncant realise it.",
    "But Im puzzled about Boris.",
    "How could he be\ndangerous to me here If hed seen Olive he was in London I\nsuppose\n\nHe was in London yes.",
    "Then I simply dont get it...Oh well what does it matter What the\nhell does anything matter Here we are stuck in this bloody Unit\nsurrounded by a lot of inhuman Robots...\n\nThats just how they felt to me.",
    "And we cant get out He pounded with his fist on the concrete.",
    "We cant get out.",
    "Oh yes we can said Hilary.",
    "He turned to stare at her in surprise.",
    "What on earth do you mean\n\nWell find a way said Hilary.",
    "My dear girl his laugh was scornful.",
    "You havent the faintest idea\nwhat youre up against in this place.",
    "People escaped from the most impossible places during the war\nsaid Hilary stubbornly.",
    "She was not going to give in to despair.",
    "They tunnelled or something.",
    "How can you tunnel through sheer rock And where to Its desert\nall round.",
    "Then it will have to be or something.",
    "He looked at her.",
    "She smiled with a confidence that was dogged\nrather than genuine.",
    "What an extraordinary girl you are.",
    "You sound quite sure of\nyourself.",
    "Theres always a way.",
    "I dare say it will take time and a lot of\nplanning.",
    "His face clouded over again.",
    "Time he said.",
    "Time... Thats what I cant afford.",
    "Why\n\nI dont know whether youll be able to understand... Its like this.",
    "I\ncant really  do my stuff here.",
    "She frowned.",
    "How do you mean\n\nHow shall I put it I cant work.",
    "I cant think.",
    "In my stuff one has to\nhave a high degree of concentration.",
    "A lot of it is  well  creative.",
    "Since coming here Ive just lost the urge.",
    "All I can do is good sound\nhack work.",
    "The sort of thing any twopennyhalfpenny scientific\nchap can do.",
    "But thats not what they brought me here for.",
    "They\nwant original stuff and I cant do original stuff.",
    "And the more\nnervous and afraid I get the less Im fit to turn out anything worth\nturning out.",
    "And its driving me off my rocker do you see\n\nYes she saw now.",
    "She recalled Dr. Rubecs remarks about prima\ndonnas and scientists.",
    "If I cant deliver the goods what is an outfit like this going to do\nabout it Theyll liquidate me.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Oh yes they will.",
    "Theyre not sentimentalists here.",
    "Whats saved\nme so far is this plastic surgery business.",
    "They do it a little at a\ntime you know.",
    "And naturally a fellow whos having constant minor\noperations cant be expected to concentrate.",
    "But theyve finished\nthe business now.",
    "But why was it done at all Whats the point\n\nOh that For safety.",
    "My safety I mean.",
    "Its done if  if youre a\nwanted man.",
    "Are you a wanted man then\n\n\fYes didnt you know Oh I suppose they wouldnt advertise the\nfact in the papers.",
    "Perhaps even Olive didnt know.",
    "But Im wanted\nright enough.",
    "You mean for  treason is the word isnt it You mean youve sold\nthem atom secrets\n\nHe avoided her eyes.",
    "I didnt sell anything.",
    "I gave them what I knew of our processes gave it freely.",
    "If you can believe me I wanted to give it to them.",
    "It\nwas part of the whole setup  the pooling of scientific knowledge.",
    "Oh cant you understand\n\nShe could understand.",
    "She could understand Andy Peters doing\njust that.",
    "She could see Ericsson with his fanatical dreamers eyes\nbetraying his country with a highsouled enthusiasm.",
    "Yet it was hard for her to visualise Tom Betterton doing it  and she\nrealised with a shock that all that showed was the difference\nbetween Betterton a few months ago arriving in all the zeal of\nenthusiasm and Betterton now nervous defeated down to earth an ordinary badly frightened man.",
    "Even as she accepted the logic of that Betterton looked round him\nnervously and said\n\nEveryones gone down.",
    "Wed better \n\nShe rose.",
    "Yes.",
    "But its all right you know.",
    "Theyll think it quite natural  under\nthe circumstances.",
    "He said awkwardly\n\nWell have to go on with this now you know.",
    "I mean  youll have to\ngo on being  my wife.",
    "Of course.",
    "And well have to share a room and all that.",
    "But it will be quite all\nright.",
    "I mean you neednt be afraid that \n\nHe swallowed in an embarrassed manner.",
    "How handsome he is thought Hilary looking at his profile and\nhow little it moves me...",
    "I dont think we need worry about that she said cheerfully.",
    "The\nimportant thing is to get out of here alive.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nIn a room at the Hotel Mamounia Marrakesh the man called Jessop\nwas talking to Miss Hetherington.",
    "A different Miss Hetherington\nthis from the one that Hilary had known at Casablanca and at Fez.",
    "The same appearance the same twin set the same depressing\n\n\fhairdo.",
    "But the manner had changed.",
    "It was a woman now both\nbrisk\n\ncompetent\n\nand\n\nseeming\n\nyears\n\nyounger\n\nthan\n\nher\n\nappearance.",
    "The third person in the room was a dark stocky man with intelligent\neyes.",
    "He was tapping gently on the table with his fingers and\nhumming a little French song under his breath.",
    "... and as far as you know Jessop was saying those are the only\npeople she talked to at Fez\n\nJanet Hetherington nodded.",
    "There was the Calvin Baker woman whom wed already met at\nCasablanca.",
    "Ill say frankly I still cant make up my mind about her.",
    "She went out of her way to be friendly with Olive Betterton and with\nme for that matter.",
    "But Americans are friendly they do enter into\nconversation with people in hotels and they like joining them on\ntrips.",
    "Yes said Jessop its all a little too overt for what were looking\nfor.",
    "And besides went on Janet Hetherington she was on this plane\ntoo.",
    "Youre assuming said Jessop that the crash was planned.",
    "He\nlooked sideways towards the dark stocky man.",
    "What about it\nLeblanc\n\n\fLeblanc stopped humming his tune and stopped his little tattoo on\nthe table for a moment or two.",
    "\u0417ala ce peut he said.",
    "There may have been sabotage to the\nmachine and that is why it crashed.",
    "We shall never know.",
    "The plane\ncrashed and went up in flames and everyone on board was killed.",
    "What do you know of the pilot\n\nAlcadi Young reasonably competent.",
    "No more.",
    "Badly paid.",
    "He\nadded the two last words with a slight pause in front of them.",
    "Jessop said\n\nOpen therefore to other employment but presumably not a\ncandidate for suicide\n\nThere were seven bodies said Leblanc.",
    "Badly charred\nunrecognisable but seven bodies.",
    "One cannot get away from that.",
    "Jessop turned back to Janet Hetherington.",
    "You were saying he said.",
    "There was a French family at Fez that Mrs. Betterton exchanged a\nfew words with.",
    "There was a rich Swedish business man with a\nglamour girl.",
    "And the rich oil magnate Mr. Aristides.",
    "Ah said Leblanc that fabulous figure himself.",
    "What must it feel\nlike I have often asked myself to have all the money in the world\n\n\fFor me he added frankly I would keep race horses and women\nand all the world has to offer.",
    "But old Aristides shuts himself up in\nhis castle in Spain  literally his castle in Spain mon cher  and\ncollects so they say Chinese potteries of the Sung period.",
    "But one\nmust remember he added that he is at least seventy.",
    "It is\npossible at that age that Chinese potteries are all that interest one.",
    "According to the Chinese themselves said Jessop the years\nbetween sixty and seventy are the most rich in living and one is then\nmost appreciative of the beauty and delight of life.",
    "Pas moi said Leblanc.",
    "There were some Germans at Fez too continued Janet\nHetherington but as far as I know they didnt exchange any\nremarks with Olive Betterton.",
    "A waiter or a servant perhaps said Jessop.",
    "Thats always possible.",
    "And she went out into the old town alone you say\n\nShe went with one of the regular guides.",
    "Someone may have\ncontacted her on that tour.",
    "At any rate she decided quite suddenly to go to Marrakesh.",
    "Not suddenly she corrected him.",
    "She already had her\nreservations.",
    "Ah Im wrong said Jessop.",
    "What I mean is that Mrs. Calvin\nBaker decided rather suddenly to accompany her.",
    "He got up and\npaced up and down.",
    "She flew to Marrakesh he said and the\nplane crashed and came down in flames.",
    "It seems illomened does\nit not for anyone called Olive Betterton to travel by air.",
    "First the\ncrash near Casablanca and then this one.",
    "Was it an accident or\nwas it contrived If there were people who wished to get rid of Olive\nBetterton there would be easier ways to do it than by wrecking a\nplane I should say.",
    "One never knows said Leblanc.",
    "Understand me mon cher.",
    "Once you have got into that state of mind where the taking of\nhuman lives no longer counts then if it is simpler to put a little\nexplosive package under a seat in a plane than to wait about at the\ncorner on a dark night and stick a knife into someone then the\npackage will be left and the fact that six other people will die also is\nnot even considered.",
    "Of course said Jessop I know Im in a minority of one but I still\nthink theres a third solution  that they faked the crash.",
    "Leblanc looked at him with interest.",
    "That could be done yes.",
    "The plane could be brought down and it\ncould be set on fire.",
    "But you cannot get away from the fact mon\ncher Jessop that there were people in the plane.",
    "The charred\nbodies were actually there.",
    "I know said Jessop.",
    "Thats the stumbling block.",
    "Oh Ive no\ndoubt my ideas are fantastic but its such a neat ending to our hunt.",
    "Too neat.",
    "Thats what I feel.",
    "It says finish to us.",
    "We write down R.I.P.",
    "in the margin of our report and its ended.",
    "Theres no further trail to\ntake up.",
    "He turned again to Leblanc.",
    "You are having that search\ninstituted\n\nFor two days now said Leblanc.",
    "Good men too.",
    "Its a\nparticularly lonely spot of course where the plane crashed.",
    "It was\noff its course by the way.",
    "Which is significant Jessop put in.",
    "The nearest villages the nearest habitations the nearest traces of\na car all those are being investigated fully.",
    "In this country as well\nas in yours we fully realise the importance of the investigation.",
    "In\nFrance too we have lost some of our best young scientists.",
    "In my\nopinion mon cher it is easier to control temperamental opera\nsingers than it is to control a scientist.",
    "They are brilliant these\nyoung men erratic rebellious and finally and dangerously they\nare most completely credulous.",
    "What do they imagine goes on l\u0430bas Sweetness and light and desire for truth and the millennium\nAlas poor children what disillusionment awaits them.",
    "Lets go over the passenger list once more said Jessop.",
    "The Frenchman reached out a hand picked it out of a wire basket\nand set it before his colleague.",
    "The two men pored over it together.",
    "Mrs. Calvin Baker American.",
    "Mrs. Betterton English.",
    "Torquil\nEricsson Norwegian  what do you know of him by the way\n\nNothing that I can recall said Leblanc.",
    "He was young not more\nthan twentyseven or twentyeight.",
    "I know his name said Jessop frowning.",
    "I think  I am almost sure\n that he read a paper before the Royal Society.",
    "Then there is the religieuse Leblanc said turning back to the list.",
    "Sister Marie something or other.",
    "Andrew Peters also American.",
    "Dr. Barron.",
    "That is a celebrated name le doctor Barron.",
    "A man of\ngreat brilliance.",
    "An expert on virus diseases.",
    "Biological warfare said Jessop.",
    "It fits.",
    "It all fits.",
    "A man poorly paid and discontented said Leblanc.",
    "How many going to St. Ives murmured Jessop.",
    "The Frenchman shot him a quick look and he smiled apologetically.",
    "Just an old nursery rhyme he said.",
    "For St. Ives read question\nmark.",
    "Journey to nowhere.",
    "The telephone on the table buzzed and Leblanc picked up the\nreceiver.",
    "Allo he said.",
    "Quest ce quil y a Ah yes send them up.",
    "He\nturned his head towards Jessop.",
    "His face was suddenly alive\n\n\fvigorous.",
    "One of my men reporting he said.",
    "They have found\nsomething.",
    "Mon cher collegue it is possible  I say no more possible that your optimism is justified.",
    "A few moments later two men entered the room.",
    "The first bore a\nrough resemblance to Leblanc the same type stocky dark\nintelligent.",
    "His manner was respectful but exhilarated.",
    "He wore\nEuropean clothes badly stained and marked covered with dust.",
    "He\nhad obviously just arrived from a journey.",
    "With him was a native\nwearing the white local dress.",
    "He had the dignified composure of\nthe dweller in remote places.",
    "His manner was courteous but not\nsubservient.",
    "He looked with a faint wonder round the room whilst\nthe other man explained things in rapid French.",
    "The reward was offered and circulated the man explained and\nthis fellow and his family and a great many of his friends have been\nsearching diligently.",
    "I let him bring you the find himself as there\nmay be questions you want to ask him.",
    "Leblanc turned to the Berber \n\nYou have done good work he said speaking now in the mans\nown language.",
    "You have the eyes of the hawk my father.",
    "Show us\nthen what you have discovered.",
    "From a fold in his white robe the man took out a small object and\nstepping forward laid it on the table before the Frenchman.",
    "It was\nrather a large sized pinkish grey synthetic pearl.",
    "It is like the one shown to me and shown to others he said.",
    "It is\nof value and I have found it.",
    "Jessop stretched out a hand and took the pearl.",
    "From his pocket he\ndrew out another exactly like it and examined both.",
    "Then he walked\nacross the room to the window and examined them both through a\npowerful lens.",
    "Yes he said the mark is there.",
    "There was jubilation now in his\nvoice and he came back to the table.",
    "Good girl he said good\ngirl good girl She managed it\n\nLeblanc was questioning the Berber in a rapid exchange of Arabic.",
    "Finally he turned to Jessop.",
    "I make my apologies mon cher collegue he said.",
    "This pearl was\nfound at a distance of nearly half a mile from the flaming plane.",
    "Which shows said Jessop that Olive Betterton was a survivor\nand that though seven people left Fez in the plane and seven\ncharred bodies were found one of those charred bodies was\ndefinitely not hers.",
    "We extend the search now said Leblanc.",
    "He spoke again to the\nBerber and the man smiled back happily.",
    "He left the room with the\nman who had brought him in.",
    "He will be handsomely rewarded as\npromised said Leblanc and there will be a hunt now all over the\ncountryside for these pearls.",
    "They have hawk eyes these people\nand the knowledge that these are worth good money in reward will\npass round like a grapevine.",
    "I think  I think mon cher collegue that\n\n\fwe shall get results If only they have not tumbled to what she was\ndoing.",
    "Jessop shook his head.",
    "It would be such a natural occurrence he said.",
    "The sudden\nbreaking of a necklace of costume jewellery such as most women\nwear the picking up apparently of what loose pearls she can find\nand stuffing them into her pocket then a little hole in the pocket.",
    "Besides why should they suspect her She is Olive Betterton\nanxious to join her husband.",
    "We must review this matter in a new light said Leblanc.",
    "He drew\nthe passenger list towards him.",
    "Olive Betterton.",
    "Dr. Barron he\nsaid ticking off the two names.",
    "Two at least who are going wherever they are going.",
    "The American woman Mrs. Calvin Baker.",
    "As to her we keep an open mind.",
    "Torquil Ericsson you say has read\npapers before the Royal Society.",
    "The American Peters was\ndescribed on his passport as a Research Chemist.",
    "The religieuse well it would make a good disguise.",
    "In fact a whole cargo of\npeople cleverly shepherded from different points to travel in that\none plane on that particular day.",
    "And then the plane is discovered\nin flames and inside it the requisite number of charred bodies.",
    "How\ndid they manage that I wonder Enfin cest colossal\n\nYes said Jessop.",
    "It was the final convincing touch.",
    "But we know\nnow that six or seven people have started off on a fresh journey\nand we know where their point of departure is.",
    "What do we do next visit the spot\n\n\fBut precisely said Leblanc.",
    "We take up advanced headquarters.",
    "If I mistake not now that we are on the track other evidence will\ncome to light.",
    "If our calculations are exact Leblanc said there should be\nresults.",
    "The calculations were many and devious.",
    "The rate of progress of a\ncar the likely distance where it would refuel possible villages\nwhere travellers might have stayed the night.",
    "The tracks were\nmany and confusing disappointments were continual but every\nnow and then there came a positive result.",
    "Voila mon capitaine A search of the latrines as you ordered.",
    "In a\ndark corner of the latrine a pearl embedded in a little piece of\nchewing gum in the house of one Abdul Mohammed.",
    "He and his\nsons have been interrogated.",
    "At first they denied but at last they\nhave confessed.",
    "A carload of six people said to be from the German\narchaeological expedition spent a night in his house.",
    "Much money\nwas paid and they were not to mention this to anyone the excuse\nbeing that there was some illicit digging in prospect.",
    "Children in the\nvillage of El Kaif also have brought in two more pearls.",
    "We know\nnow the direction.",
    "There is more Monsieur le Capitaine.",
    "The hand\nFatma has been seen as you foretold.",
    "This type here he will tell you\nabout it.",
    "This type was a particularly wildlooking Berber.",
    "I was with my flocks he said at night and I heard a car.",
    "It\npassed me and as it did so I saw the sign.",
    "The hand of Fatma was\noutlined on one side of it.",
    "It gleamed I tell you in the darkness.",
    "The application of phosphorous on a glove can be very\nefficacious murmured Leblanc.",
    "I congratulate you mon cher on\nthat idea.",
    "Its effective said Jessop but its dangerous.",
    "Its too easily\nnoticed by the fugitives themselves I mean.",
    "Leblanc shrugged his shoulders.",
    "It could not be seen in daylight.",
    "No but if there was a halt and they alighted from the car in the\ndarkness \n\nEven then  it is a notable Arab superstition.",
    "It is painted often on\ncarts and wagons.",
    "It would only be thought that some pious Moslem\nhad painted it in luminous paint on his vehicle.",
    "True enough.",
    "But we must be on our guard.",
    "For if our enemies did\nnotice it it is highly possible that they will lay a false trail for us of\nhands of Fatma in phosphorous paint.",
    "Ah as to that I agree with you.",
    "One must indeed be on ones guard.",
    "Always always on ones guard.",
    "On the following morning Leblanc had another exhibit of three false\npearls arranged in a triangle stuck together by a little piece of\nchewing gum.",
    "This should mean said Jessop that the next stage of the journey\nwas by plane.",
    "He looked enquiringly at Leblanc.",
    "You are absolutely right said the other.",
    "This was found on a\ndisused army airfield in a remote and desolate place.",
    "There were\nsigns that a plane landed and left there not long ago.",
    "He shrugged\nhis shoulders.",
    "An unknown plane he said and once again they\ntook off for a destination unknown.",
    "That brings us once more to a\nhalt and we do not know where next to take up the trail.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nIts incredible thought Hilary to herself incredible that Ive been\nhere ten days The frightening thing in life Hilary thought was\nhow easily you adapted yourself.",
    "She remembered once being\nshown in France some peculiar torture arrangement of the Middle\nAges an iron cage wherein a prisoner had been confined and in\nwhich he could neither lie stand nor sit.",
    "The guide had recounted\nhow the last man imprisoned there had lived in it for eighteen years\nhad been released and had lived for another twenty after that\nbefore dying an old man.",
    "That adaptability thought Hilary was\nwhat differentiated man from the animal world.",
    "Man could live in\n\n\fany climate and on any food and under any conditions.",
    "He could\nexist slave or free.",
    "She had felt first when introduced into the Unit a blinding panic a\nhorrible feeling of imprisonment and frustration and the fact that\nthe imprisonment was camouflaged in circumstances of luxury had\nsomehow made it seem all the more horrible to her.",
    "And yet now\nalready even after a week here she had begun insensibly to accept\nthe conditions of her life as natural.",
    "It was a queer dreamlike\nexistence.",
    "Nothing seemed particularly real but already she had\nthe feeling that the dream had gone on a long time and would go on\nfor a long time more.",
    "It would perhaps last forever... She would\nalways live here in the Unit this was life and there was nothing\noutside.",
    "This dangerous acceptance she thought came partly from the fact\nthat she was a woman.",
    "Women were adaptable by nature.",
    "It was\ntheir\n\nstrength\n\nand\n\ntheir\n\nweakness.",
    "They\n\nexamined\n\ntheir\n\nenvironment accepted it and like realists settled down to make the\nbest of it.",
    "What interested her most were the reactions of the\npeople who had arrived here with her.",
    "Helga Needheim she hardly\never saw except sometimes at meals.",
    "When they met the German\nwoman vouchsafed her a curt nod but no more.",
    "As far as she could\njudge Helga Needheim was happy and satisfied.",
    "The Unit obviously\nlived up to the picture she had formed in her mind of it.",
    "She was the\ntype of woman absorbed by her work and was comfortably\nsustained by her natural arrogance.",
    "The superiority of herself and\nher fellow scientists was the first article of Helgas creed.",
    "She had\nno views of a brotherhood of man of an era of peace Of liberty of\nmind and spirit.",
    "For her the future was narrow but all conquering.",
    "The super race herself a member of it the rest of the world in\nbondage treated if they behaved with condescending kindness.",
    "If\nher fellow workers expressed different views if their ideas were\nCommunist rather than Fascist Helga took little notice.",
    "If their work\nwas good they were necessary and their ideas would change.",
    "Dr. Barron was more intelligent than Helga Needheim.",
    "Occasionally\nHilary had brief conversations with him.",
    "He was absorbed in his\nwork deeply satisfied with the conditions provided for him but his\nenquiring Gallic intellect led him to speculate and ponder on the\nmedia in which he found himself.",
    "It was not what I expected.",
    "No frankly he said one day entre\nnous Mrs. Betterton I do not care for prison conditions.",
    "And these\nare prison conditions though the cage let us say is heavily\ngilded.",
    "There is hardly the freedom here that you came to seek Hilary\nsuggested.",
    "He smiled at her a quick rueful smile.",
    "But no he said you are wrong.",
    "I did not really seek liberty.",
    "I am\na civilised man.",
    "The civilised man knows there is no such thing.",
    "Only the younger and cruder nations put the word Liberty on their\nbanner.",
    "There must always be a planned framework of security.",
    "And the essence of civilisation is that the way of life should be a\nmoderate one.",
    "The middle way.",
    "Always one comes back to the\nmiddle way.",
    "No.",
    "I will be frank with you.",
    "I came here for money.",
    "Hilary in her turn smiled.",
    "Her eyebrows rose.",
    "And what good is money to you here\n\nIt pays for very expensive laboratory equipment said Dr. Barron.",
    "I am not obliged to put my hand into my own pocket and so I can\nserve the cause of science and satisfy my own intellectual curiosity.",
    "I am a man who loves his work true but I do not love it for the sake\nof humanity.",
    "I have usually found that those who do so are\nsomewhat woolly headed and often incompetent workers.",
    "No it is\nthe pure intellectual joy of research that I appreciate.",
    "For the rest\na large sum of money was paid to me before I left France.",
    "It is safely\nbanked under another name and in due course when all this comes\nto an end I shall have it to spend as I choose.",
    "When all this comes to an end Hilary repeated.",
    "But why should\nit come to an end\n\nOne must have the common sense said Dr. Barron nothing is\npermanent nothing endures.",
    "I have come to the conclusion that\nthis place is run by a madman.",
    "A madman let me tell you can be\nvery logical.",
    "If you are rich and logical and also mad you can\nsucceed for a very long time in living out your illusion.",
    "But in the\nend  he shrugged  in the end this will break up.",
    "Because you\nsee it is not reasonable what happens here That which is not\nreasonable must always pay the reckoning in the end.",
    "In the\nmeantime  again he shrugged his shoulders  it suits me\nadmirably.",
    "Torquil\n\nEricsson\n\nwhom\n\nHilary\n\nexpected\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nviolently\n\ndisillusioned appeared to be quite content in the atmosphere of the\nUnit.",
    "Less practical than the Frenchman he existed in a singleminded vision of his own.",
    "The world in which he lived was one so\nunfamiliar to Hilary that she could not even understand it.",
    "It\nengendered a kind of austere happiness an absorption in\nmathematical calculations and an endless vista of possibilities.",
    "The\nstrange impersonal ruthlessness of his character frightened\nHilary.",
    "He was the kind of young man she thought who in a\nmoment of idealism could send three quarters of the world to their\ndeath in order that the remaining quarter should participate in an\nimpractical Utopia that existed only in Ericssons mind.",
    "With the American Andy Peters Hilary felt herself far more in\naccord.",
    "Possibly she thought it was because Peters was a man of\ntalents but not a genius.",
    "From what others said she gathered he\nwas a firstclass man at his job a careful and skilled chemist but\nnot a pioneer.",
    "Peters like herself had at once hated and feared the\natmosphere of the Unit.",
    "The truth is that I didnt know where I was going he said.",
    "I\nthought I knew but I was wrong.",
    "The Party has got nothing to do\nwith this place.",
    "Were not in touch with Moscow.",
    "This is a lone show\nof some kind  a Fascist show possibly.",
    "Dont you think said Hilary that you go in too much for labels\n\nHe considered this.",
    "Maybe youre right he said.",
    "Come to think of it these words we\nthrow around dont mean much.",
    "But I do know this.",
    "I want to get out\nof here and I mean to get out of here.",
    "It wont be easy said Hilary in a low voice.",
    "They were walking together after dinner near the splashing\nfountains of the roof garden.",
    "With the illusion of darkness and the\nstarlit sky they might have been in the private gardens of some\nsultans palace.",
    "The functional concrete buildings were veiled from\ntheir sight.",
    "No said Peters it wont be easy but nothings impossible.",
    "I like to hear you say that said Hilary.",
    "Oh how I like to hear you\nsay that\n\nHe looked at her sympathetically.",
    "Been getting you down he asked.",
    "Very much so.",
    "But thats not what Im really afraid of.",
    "No what then\n\nIm afraid of getting used to it said Hilary.",
    "Yes.",
    "He spoke thoughtfully.",
    "Yes I know what you mean.",
    "Theres\na kind of mass suggestion going on here.",
    "I think perhaps youre\nright about that.",
    "It would seem to me much more natural for people to rebel said\nHilary.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes Ive thought the same.",
    "In fact Ive wondered once or\ntwice whether theres not a little hocuspocus going on.",
    "Hocuspocus What do you mean by that\n\nWell to put it frankly dope.",
    "Do you mean a drug of some kind\n\nYes.",
    "It might be possible you know.",
    "Something in the food or\ndrink something that induces  what shall I say  docility\n\nBut is there such a drug\n\nWell thats not really my line of country.",
    "There are things that are\ngiven to people to soothe them down to make them acquiescent\nbefore operations and that.",
    "Whether there is anything that can be\nadministered steadily over a long period of time  and which at the\nsame time does not impair efficiency  that I dont know.",
    "Im more\ninclined to think now that the effect is produced mentally.",
    "I mean\nthat I think some of these organisers and administrators here are\nwellversed in hypnosis and psychology and that without our being\naware of it we are continually being offered suggestions of our well\nbeing of our attaining our ultimate aim whatever it is and that all\nthis does produce a definite effect.",
    "A lot can be done that way you\nknow if its done by people who know their stuff.",
    "But we mustnt acquiesce cried Hilary hotly.",
    "We mustnt feel for\none moment that its a good thing to be here.",
    "What does your husband feel\n\nTom I  oh I dont know.",
    "Its so difficult.",
    "I  she lapsed into\nsilence.",
    "The whole fantasy of her life as she lived it she could hardly\ncommunicate to the man who was listening to her.",
    "For ten days now\nshe had lived in an apartment with a man who was a stranger to\nher.",
    "They shared a bedroom and when she lay awake at night she\ncould hear him breathing in the other bed.",
    "Both of them accepted\nthe arrangement as inevitable.",
    "She was an impostor a spy ready\nto play any part and assume any personality.",
    "Tom Betterton she\nquite frankly did not understand.",
    "He seemed to her a terrible\nexample of what could happen to a brilliant young man who had\nlived for some months in the enervating atmosphere of the Unit.",
    "At\nany rate there was in him no calm acceptance of his destiny.",
    "Far\nfrom taking pleasure in his work he was she thought increasingly\nworried by his inability to concentrate on it.",
    "Once or twice he had\nreiterated what he had said on that first evening.",
    "I cant think.",
    "Its just as though everything in me has dried up.",
    "Yes she thought Tom Betterton being a real genius needed\nliberty more than most.",
    "Suggestion had failed to compensate him\nfor the loss of freedom.",
    "Only in perfect liberty was he able to\nproduce creative work.",
    "He was a man she thought very close to a serious nervous\nbreakdown.",
    "Hilary herself he treated with curious inattention.",
    "She\nwas not a woman to him not even a friend.",
    "She even doubted\nwhether he realised and suffered from the death of his wife.",
    "The\nthing that preoccupied him incessantly was the problem of\nconfinement.",
    "Again and again he had said\n\nI must get away from here.",
    "I must I must.",
    "And sometimes I\ndidnt know.",
    "Id no idea what it was going to be like.",
    "How am I going\nto get out of here How Ive got to.",
    "Ive simply got to.",
    "It was in essence very much what Peters had said.",
    "But it was said\nwith a great deal of difference.",
    "Peters had spoken as a young\nenergetic angry disillusioned man sure of himself and determined\nto pit his wits against the brains of the establishment in which he\nfound himself.",
    "But Tom Bettertons rebellious utterances were\nthose of a man at the end of his tether a man almost crazed with\nthe need for escape.",
    "But perhaps Hilary thought suddenly that\nwas where she and Peters would be in six months time.",
    "Perhaps\nwhat began as healthy rebellion and a reasonable confidence in\nones own ingenuity would turn at last into the frenzied despair of a\nrat in a trap.",
    "She wished she could talk of all this to the man beside her.",
    "If only\nshe could say Tom Betterton isnt my husband.",
    "I know nothing\nabout him.",
    "I dont know what he was like before he came here and\nso Im in the dark.",
    "I cant help him for I dont know what to do or\nsay.",
    "As it was she had to pick her words carefully.",
    "She said\n\n\fTom seems like a stranger to me now.",
    "He doesnt  tell me things.",
    "Sometimes I think the confinement the sense of being penned up\nhere is driving him mad.",
    "Its possible said Peters drily it could act that way.",
    "But tell me  you speak so confidently of getting away.",
    "How can we\nget away  what earthly chance is there\n\nI dont mean we can walk out the day after tomorrow Olive.",
    "The\nthings got to be thought out and planned.",
    "People have escaped\nyou know under the most unpromising conditions.",
    "A lot of our\npeople and a lot your side of the Atlantic too have written books\nabout escape from fortresses in Germany.",
    "That was rather different.",
    "Not in essence.",
    "Where theres a way in theres a way out.",
    "Of\ncourse tunnelling is out of the question here so that knocks out a\ngood many methods.",
    "But as I say where theres a way in theres a\nway out.",
    "With ingenuity camouflage playing a part deception\nbribery and corruption one ought to manage it.",
    "Its the sort of thing\nyouve got to study and think about.",
    "Ill tell you this.",
    "I shall get out of\nhere.",
    "Take it from me.",
    "I believe you will said Hilary then she added but shall I\n\nWell its different for you.",
    "His voice sounded embarrassed.",
    "For a moment she wondered what\nhe meant.",
    "Then she realised that presumably her own objective had\nbeen attained.",
    "She had come here to join the man she had loved\nand having joined him her own personal need for escape should not\nbe so great.",
    "She was almost tempted to tell Peters the truth  but\nsome instinct of caution forbade that.",
    "She said goodnight and left the roof.",
    "Chapter 16\n\nGood evening Mrs. Betterton.",
    "Good evening Miss Jennsen.",
    "The thin spectacled girl was looking excited.",
    "Her eyes glinted\nbehind the thick lenses.",
    "There will be a Reunion this evening she said.",
    "The Director\nhimself is going to address us\n\nShe spoke in an almost hushed voice.",
    "Thats good said Andy Peters who was standing close by.",
    "Ive\nbeen waiting to catch a glimpse of this Director.",
    "Miss Jennsen threw him a glance of shocked reproof.",
    "The Director she said austerely is a very wonderful man.",
    "As she went away from them down one of the inevitable white\ncorridors Andy Peters gave a low whistle.",
    "Now did I or did I not catch a hint of the Heil Hitler attitude\nthere\n\nIt certainly sounded like it.",
    "The trouble in this life is that you never really know where youre\ngoing.",
    "If Id known when I left the States all full of boyish ardour for\nthe good old Brotherhood of Man that I was going to land myself in\nthe clutches of yet another Heavenborn Dictator  he threw out his\nhands.",
    "You dont know that yet Hilary reminded him.",
    "I can smell it  in the air said Peters.",
    "Oh cried Hilary how glad I am that youre here.",
    "She flushed as he looked at her quizzically.",
    "Youre so nice and ordinary said Hilary desperately.",
    "Peters looked amused.",
    "Where I come from he said the word ordinary doesnt have your\nmeaning.",
    "It can stand for being just plain mean.",
    "You know I didnt mean it that way.",
    "I mean youre like everybody\nelse.",
    "Oh dear that sounds rude too.",
    "The common man thats what youre asking for Youve had\nenough of the genius\n\nYes and youve changed too since you came here.",
    "Youve lost\nthat streak of bitterness  of hatred.",
    "But immediately his face grew rather grim.",
    "Dont count on that he said.",
    "Its still there  underneath.",
    "I can still\nhate.",
    "There are things believe me that should be hated.",
    "The Reunion as Miss Jennsen had called it took place after dinner.",
    "All members of the Unit assembled in the large lecture room.",
    "The audience did not include what might be called the technical\nstaff the laboratory assistants the corps de ballet the various\nservice personnel and the small assembly of handsome prostitutes\nwho also served the Unit as purveyors of sex to those men who had\nno wives with them and had formed no particular attachments with\nthe female workers.",
    "Sitting next to Betterton Hilary awaited with keen curiosity the\narrival on the platform of that almost mythical figure the Director.",
    "Questioned by her Tom Betterton had given unsatisfactory almost\n\n\fvague answers about the personality of the man who controlled the\nUnit.",
    "Hes nothing much to look at he said.",
    "But he has tremendous\nimpact.",
    "Actually Ive only seen him twice.",
    "He doesnt show up often.",
    "Hes remarkable of course one feels that but honestly I dont\nknow why.",
    "From the reverent way Miss Jennsen and some of the other women\nspoke about him Hilary had formed a vague mental figure of a tall\nman with a golden beard wearing a white robe  a kind of godlike\nabstraction.",
    "She was almost startled when as the audience rose to their feet a\ndark rather heavily built man of middle age came quietly onto the\nplatform.",
    "In appearance he was quite undistinguished he might\nhave been a business man from the Midlands.",
    "His nationality was\nnot apparent.",
    "He spoke to them in three languages alternating one\nwith the other and never exactly repeating himself.",
    "He used\nFrench German and English and each was spoken with equal\nfluency.",
    "Let me first he began welcome our new colleagues who have\ncome to join us here.",
    "He then paid a few words of tribute to each of the new arrivals.",
    "After that he went on to speak of the aims and beliefs of the Unit.",
    "Trying to remember his words later Hilary found herself unable to\ndo so with any accuracy.",
    "Or perhaps it was that the words as\nremembered seemed trite and ordinary.",
    "But listening to them was\na very different thing.",
    "Hilary remembered once being told by a friend who had lived in\nGermany in the days before the war how she had gone to a\nmeeting in mere curiosity to listen to that absurd Hitler  and how\nshe had found herself crying hysterically swept away by intense\nemotion.",
    "She had described how wise and inspiring every word had\nseemed and how afterwards the remembered words in their\nactuality had seemed commonplace enough.",
    "Something of the same kind was happening now.",
    "In spite of herself\nHilary was stirred and uplifted.",
    "The Director spoke very simply.",
    "He\nspoke primarily of Youth.",
    "With Youth lay the future of mankind.",
    "Accumulated Wealth Prestige influential Families  those have\nbeen the forces of the past.",
    "But today power lies in the hands of\nthe young.",
    "Power is in Brains.",
    "The brains of the chemist the\nphysicist the doctor... From the laboratories comes the power to\ndestroy on a vast scale.",
    "With that power you can say Yield  or\nperish That power should not be given to this or that nation.",
    "Power\nshould be in the hands of those who create it.",
    "This Unit is a\ngathering place for the Power of all the world.",
    "You come here from\nall parts of the globe bringing with you your creative scientific\nknowledge.",
    "And with you you bring Youth No one here is over\nfortyfive.",
    "When the day comes we shall create a Trust.",
    "The Brains\nTrust of Science.",
    "And we shall administer world affairs.",
    "We shall\n\n\fissue our orders to Capitalist and Kings and Armies and Industries.",
    "We shall give the World the Pax Scientifica.",
    "There was more of it  all the same heady intoxicating stuff  but it\nwas not the words themselves  it was the power of the orator that\ncarried away an assembly that could have been cold and critical\nhad it not been swayed by that nameless emotion about which so\nlittle is known.",
    "When the Director had ended abruptly\n\nCourage and Victory Goodnight Hilary left the Hall half\nstumbling in a kind of exalted dream and recognised the same\nfeeling in the faces around her.",
    "She saw Ericsson in particular his\npale eyes gleaming his head tossed back in exultation.",
    "Then she felt Andy Peters hand on her arm and his voice said in her\near\n\nCome up on the roof.",
    "We need some air.",
    "They went up in the lift without speaking and stepped out among\nthe palm trees under the stars.",
    "Peters drew a deep breath.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "This is what we need.",
    "Air to blow away the clouds\nof glory.",
    "Hilary gave a deep sigh.",
    "She still felt unreal.",
    "He gave her arm a friendly shake.",
    "Snap out of it Olive.",
    "Clouds of glory said Hilary.",
    "You know  it was like that\n\nSnap out of it I tell you.",
    "Be a woman Down to earth and basic\nrealities When the effects of the Glory Gas poisoning pass off youll\nrealise that youve been listening to the same old mixture as\nbefore.",
    "But it was fine  I mean a fine ideal.",
    "Nuts to ideals.",
    "Take the facts.",
    "Youth and Brains  glory glory\nAlleluia And what are the youth and brains Helga Needheim a\nruthless egoist.",
    "Torquil Ericsson an impractical dreamer.",
    "Dr.\nBarron whod sell his grandmother to the knackers yard to get\nequipment for his work.",
    "Take me an ordinary guy as youve said\nyourself good with the testtube and the microscope but with no\ntalent whatever for efficient administration of an office let alone a\nWorld Take your own husband  yes Im going to say it  a man\nwhose nerves are frayed to nothing and who can think of nothing\nbut the fear that retribution will catch up with him.",
    "Ive given you\nthose people we know best  but theyre all the same here  or all\nthat Ive come across.",
    "Geniuses some of them damned good at\ntheir chosen jobs  but as Administrators of the Universe  hell\ndont make me laugh Pernicious nonsense thats what weve been\nlistening to.",
    "Hilary sat down on the concrete parapet.",
    "She passed a hand across\nher forehead.",
    "You know she said.",
    "I believe youre right...",
    "But the clouds of\nglory are still trailing.",
    "How does he do it Does he believe it\nhimself He must.",
    "Peters said gloomily\n\nI suppose it always comes to the same thing in the end.",
    "A madman\nwho believes hes God.",
    "Hilary said slowly\n\nI suppose so.",
    "And yet  that seems curiously unsatisfactory.",
    "But it happens my dear.",
    "Again and again throughout history it\nhappens.",
    "And it gets one.",
    "It nearly got me tonight.",
    "It did get you.",
    "If I\nhadnt whisked you up here  his manner changed suddenly.",
    "I\nsuppose I shouldnt have done that.",
    "What will Betterton say Hell\nthink it odd.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "I doubt if hell notice.",
    "He looked at her questioningly.",
    "Im sorry Olive.",
    "It must be all pretty fair hell for you.",
    "Seeing him go\ndown the hill.",
    "Hilary said passionately\n\nWe must get out of here.",
    "We must.",
    "We must.",
    "We shall.",
    "You said that before  but weve made no progress.",
    "Oh yes we have.",
    "Ive not been idle.",
    "She looked at him in surprise.",
    "No precise plan but Ive initiated subversive activities.",
    "Theres a\nlot of dissatisfaction here far more than our godlike Herr Director\nknows.",
    "Amongst the humbler members of the Unit I mean.",
    "Food\nand money and luxury and women arent everything you know.",
    "Ill\nget you out of here yet Olive.",
    "And Tom too.",
    "Peters face darkened.",
    "Listen Olive and believe what I say.",
    "Tom will do best to stay on\nhere.",
    "Hes  he hesitated  safer here than he would be in the\noutside world.",
    "Safer What a curious word.",
    "Safer said Peters.",
    "I use the word deliberately.",
    "Hilary frowned.",
    "I dont really see what you mean.",
    "Toms not  you dont think hes\nbecoming mentally unhinged\n\nNot in the least.",
    "Hes het up but Id say Tom Bettertons as sane as\nyou or I.",
    "Then why are you saying hed be safer here\n\nPeters said slowly\n\nA cage you know is a very safe place to be.",
    "Oh no cried Hilary.",
    "Dont tell me youre going to believe that too.",
    "Dont tell me that mass hypnotism or suggestion or whatever it is\nis working on you.",
    "Safe tame content We must rebel still We must\nwant to be free\n\nPeters said slowly\n\nYes I know.",
    "But \n\nTom at any rate wants desperately to get away from here.",
    "Tom maynt know whats good for him.",
    "Suddenly Hilary remembered what Tom had hinted at to her.",
    "If he\nhad disposed of secret information he would be liable she\nsupposed to prosecution under the Official Secrets Act  That no\ndoubt was what Peters was hinting at in his rather embarrassed\n\n\fway  but Hilary was clear in her own mind.",
    "Better to serve a prison\nsentence even than remain on here.",
    "She said obstinately\n\nTom must come too.",
    "She was startled when Peters said suddenly in a bitter tone\n\nHave it your own way.",
    "Ive warned you.",
    "I wish I knew what the hell\nmakes you care for that fellow so much\n\nShe stared at him in dismay.",
    "Words sprang to her lips but she\nchecked them.",
    "She realised that what she wanted to say was I\ndont care for him.",
    "Hes nothing to me.",
    "He was another womans\nhusband and Ive a responsibility to her.",
    "She wanted to say You\nfool if theres anybody I care about its you...\n\nII\n\nBeen enjoying yourself with your tame American\n\nTom Betterton threw the words at her as she entered their\nbedroom.",
    "He was lying on his back on his bed smoking.",
    "Hilary flushed slightly.",
    "We arrived here together she said and we seem to think alike\nabout certain things.",
    "He laughed.",
    "Oh I dont blame you.",
    "For the first time he looked at her in a new\nand appraising way.",
    "Youre a goodlooking woman Olive he said.",
    "From the beginning Hilary had urged him always to call her by his\nwifes name.",
    "Yes he continued his eyes raking her up and down.",
    "Youre a\ndamned goodlooking woman.",
    "Id have noticed that once.",
    "As it is\nnothing of that kind seems to register with me any more.",
    "Perhaps its just as well said Hilary drily.",
    "Im a perfectly normal man my dear or I used to be.",
    "God knows\nwhat I am now.",
    "Hilary sat down by him.",
    "What is the matter with you Tom she said.",
    "I tell you.",
    "I cant concentrate.",
    "As a scientist Im shot to pieces.",
    "This\nplace \n\nThe others  or most of them  dont seem to feel like you\n\nBecause theyre a damned insensitive crowd I suppose.",
    "Some of them are temperamental enough said Hilary drily.",
    "She\nwent on If only you had a friend here  a real friend.",
    "Well theres Murchison.",
    "Though hes a dull dog.",
    "And Ive seen a\ngood deal of Torquil Ericsson lately.",
    "Really For some reason Hilary felt surprised.",
    "Yes.",
    "My God hes brilliant.",
    "I wish I had his brains.",
    "Hes an odd sort of person said Hilary.",
    "I always find him rather\nfrightening.",
    "Frightening Torquil Hes as mild as milk.",
    "Like a child in some\nways.",
    "No knowledge of the world.",
    "Well I find him frightening repeated Hilary obstinately.",
    "Your nerves must be getting upset too.",
    "Not yet.",
    "I suspect they will though.",
    "Tom  dont get too friendly\nwith Torquil Ericsson.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "Why ever not\n\nI dont know.",
    "Its a feeling I have.",
    "Chapter 17\n\n\fLeBlanc shrugged his shoulders.",
    "They have left Africa it is certain.",
    "Not certain.",
    "The probabilities point that way.",
    "The Frenchman shook his head.",
    "After all we know do we not for where they are bound\n\nIf they are bound for where we think why start the journey from\nAfrica Anywhere in Europe would be simpler.",
    "That is true.",
    "But there is the other side of it.",
    "No one would expect\nthem to assemble and start from here.",
    "I still think theres more to it than that.",
    "Jessop was gently\ninsistent.",
    "Besides only a small plane could have used that airfield.",
    "It would have to come down and refuel before crossing the\nMediterranean.",
    "And where they refuelled some trace should have\nbeen left.",
    "Mon cher we have instituted the most searching enquiries everywhere there has been \n\nThe men with the Geiger counters must get results in the end.",
    "The\nnumber of planes to be examined is limited.",
    "Just a trace of radioactivity and we shall know that is the plane we are looking for \n\n\fIf your agent has been able to use the spray.",
    "Alas Always so many\nifs...\n\nWe shall get there said Jessop obstinately.",
    "I wonder \n\nYes\n\nWe\n\nhave\n\nassumed\n\nthey\n\nare\n\ngoing\n\nnorth\n\n\n\ntowards\n\nthe\n\nMediterranean  suppose instead they flew south.",
    "Doubled back on their tracks But where then could they be\nflying to There are the mountains of the High Atlas  and after that\nthe desert sands.",
    "II\n\nSidi you swear to me that it will be as you have promised A petrol\nstation in America in Chicago It is certain\n\nIt is certain Mohammed if we get out of here that is.",
    "Success depends on the will of Allah.",
    "Let us hope then that it is the will of Allah that you should have a\npetrol station in Chicago.",
    "Why Chicago\n\nSidi the brother of my wife went to America and he has there a\npetrol pump in Chicago.",
    "Do I want to remain in a backward part of\n\n\fthe world all my days Here there is money and much food and\nmany rugs and women  but it is not modern.",
    "It is not America.",
    "Peters looked thoughtfully into the dignified black face.",
    "Mohammed\nin his white robes was a magnificent sight.",
    "What strange desires\nrose in the human heart\n\nI dont know that youre wise he said with a sigh but so be it.",
    "Of\ncourse if we are found out \n\nA smile on the black face revealed beautiful white teeth.",
    "Then it is death  for me certainly.",
    "Perhaps not for you Sidi since\nyou are valuable.",
    "They deal out death rather easily here do they\n\nThe shoulders of the other man rose and fell contemptuously.",
    "What is death That too is the will of Allah.",
    "You know what you have to do\n\nI know Sidi.",
    "I am to take you to the roof after dark.",
    "Also I am to put\nin your room clothing such as I and the other servants wear.",
    "Later there will be other things.",
    "Right.",
    "Youd better let me out of the lift now.",
    "Somebody may notice\nwere riding up and down.",
    "It may give them ideas.",
    "III\n\nThere was dancing going on.",
    "Andy Peters was dancing with Miss\nJennsen.",
    "He held her close to him and seemed to be murmuring in\nher ear.",
    "As they revolved slowly near where Hilary was standing he\ncaught her eye and immediately gave her an outrageous wink.",
    "Hilary biting her lip to avoid a smile averted her eyes quickly.",
    "Her glance fell on Betterton who was standing just across the room\ntalking to Torquil Ericsson.",
    "Hilary frowned a little as she watched\nthem.",
    "Have a turn with me Olive said Murchisons voice at her elbow.",
    "Yes of course Simon.",
    "Mind you Im not very hot at dancing he warned her.",
    "Hilary concentrated on keeping her feet where he could not\npossibly tread on them.",
    "Its exercise thats what I say said Murchison panting slightly.",
    "He was an energetic dancer.",
    "Awfully jolly frock youve got on Olive.",
    "His conversation seemed always to come out of an oldfashioned\nnovel.",
    "Im glad you like it said Hilary.",
    "Get it out of the Fashion Department\n\nResisting the temptation to reply Where else Hilary merely said\nYes.",
    "Must\n\nsay you\n\nknow\n\npanted\n\nMurchison\n\nas\n\nhe\n\ncapered\n\nperseveringly round the floor they do you jolly well here.",
    "Said so\nto Bianca only the other day.",
    "Beats the Welfare State every time.",
    "No\nworries about money or income tax  or repairs or upkeep.",
    "All the\nworrying done for you.",
    "Must be a wonderful life for a woman I\nshould say.",
    "Bianca finds it so does she\n\nWell she was restless for a bit but now shes managed to get up a\nfew committees and organise one or two things  debates you\nknow and lectures.",
    "Shes complaining that you dont take as much\npart as you might in things.",
    "Im afraid Im not that kind of person Simon.",
    "Ive never been very\npublic spirited.",
    "Yes but you girls have got to keep yourselves amused one way or\nanother.",
    "At least I dont mean amused exactly \n\n\fOccupied suggested Hilary.",
    "Yes  I mean the modern woman wants to get her teeth into\nsomething.",
    "I quite realise that women like you and Bianca have\nmade a definite sacrifice coming here  youre neither of you\nscientists thank goodness  really these scientific women\nAbsolutely the limit most of them I said to Bianca Give Olive time\nshes got to get tuned in.",
    "It takes a little time getting used to this\nplace.",
    "To begin with one gets a kind of claustrophobic feeling.",
    "But\nit wears off  it wears off...\n\nYou mean  one can get used to anything\n\nWell some people feel it more than others.",
    "Tom now seems to\ntake it hard.",
    "Wheres old Tom tonight Oh yes I see over there with\nTorquil.",
    "Quite inseparable those two.",
    "I wish they werent.",
    "I mean I shouldnt have thought they had very\nmuch in common.",
    "Young Torquil seems fascinated by your husband.",
    "He follows him\nround everywhere.",
    "Ive noticed it.",
    "I wondered  why\n\nWell hes always got some outlandish theory to get off his chest its beyond my power to follow him  his English isnt too good as\nyou know.",
    "But Tom listens and manages to take it all in.",
    "The dance ended.",
    "Andy Peters came up and claimed Hilary for the\nnext one.",
    "I observed you suffering in a good cause he said.",
    "How badly did\nyou get trampled\n\nOh I was fairly agile.",
    "You noticed me doing my stuff\n\nWith the Jennsen\n\nYes.",
    "I think I may say without undue modesty that I have made a\nhit a palpable hit in that quarter.",
    "These plain angular shortsighted\ngirls respond immediately when given the treatment.",
    "You certainly gave the impression of having fallen for her.",
    "That was the idea.",
    "That girl Olive properly handled can be very\nuseful.",
    "Shes in the know about all the arrangements here.",
    "For\ninstance tomorrow theres a party of various V.I.P.s due here.",
    "Doctors and a few Government officials and a rich patron or two.",
    "Andy  do you think there might be a chance...\n\nNo I dont.",
    "I bet thats going to be taken care of.",
    "So dont cherish\nfalse hopes.",
    "But it will be valuable because well get an idea of the\nprocedure.",
    "And on the next occasion  well there might be\nsomething doing.",
    "So long as I can keep the Jennsen eating out of\nmy hand I can get a lot of miscellaneous information out of her.",
    "How much do the people who are coming know\n\nAbout us  the Unit I mean  nothing at all.",
    "Or so I gather.",
    "They just\ninspect the settlement and the medical research laboratories.",
    "This\nplace has been deliberately built like a labyrinth just so that\nnobody coming into it can possibly guess its extent.",
    "I gather there\nare kinds of bulkheads that close and that shut off our area.",
    "It all seems so incredible.",
    "I know.",
    "Half the time one feels one must be dreaming.",
    "One of the\nunreal things here is never seeing any children about.",
    "Thank\ngoodness there arent You must be thankful you havent got a\nchild.",
    "He felt the sudden stiffening of her body.",
    "Here  Im sorry  I said the wrong thing He led her off the dance\nfloor and to a couple of chairs.",
    "Im very sorry he repeated.",
    "I hurt you didnt I\n\nIts nothing  no really not your fault.",
    "I did have a child  and it died\n thats all.",
    "You had a child he stared surprised.",
    "I thought youd only been\nmarried to Betterton six months\n\nOlive flushed.",
    "She said quickly\n\n\fYes of course.",
    "But I was  married before.",
    "I divorced my first\nhusband.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Thats the worst of this place.",
    "One doesnt know\nanything about peoples lives before they came here and so one\ngoes and says the wrong thing.",
    "Its odd to realise sometimes that I\ndont know anything about you at all.",
    "Or I anything about you.",
    "How you were brought up  and where your family \n\nI was brought up in a strictly scientific atmosphere.",
    "Nourished on\ntest tubes you might say.",
    "Nobody ever thought or talked of\nanything else.",
    "But I was never the bright boy of the family.",
    "Genius\nlay elsewhere.",
    "Where exactly\n\nA girl.",
    "She was brilliant.",
    "She might have been another Madame\nCurie.",
    "She could have opened up new horizons...\n\nShe  what happened to her\n\nHe said shortly\n\nShe was killed.",
    "Hilary guessed at some wartime tragedy.",
    "She said gently\n\n\fYou cared for her\n\nMore than I have ever cared for anybody.",
    "He roused himself suddenly.",
    "What the heck  weve got enough troubles in the present right\nhere and now.",
    "Look at our Norwegian friend.",
    "Apart from his eyes\nhe always looks as though he were made from wood.",
    "And that\nwonderful little stiff bow of his  as though youd pulled a string.",
    "Its because hes so very tall and thin.",
    "Not so very tall.",
    "About my height  five foot eleven or six foot not\nmore.",
    "Height is deceptive.",
    "Yes its like descriptions on passports.",
    "Take Ericsson.",
    "Height six\nfoot fair hair blue eyes face long demeanour wooden nose\nmedium mouth ordinary.",
    "Even add what a passport wouldnt speaks correctly but pedantically  you still wouldnt have the first\nidea what Torquil really looked like.",
    "Whats the matter\n\nNothing.",
    "She was staring across the room at Ericsson.",
    "That description of\nBoris Glydr Almost word for word as she had heard it from Jessop.",
    "Was that why she had always felt nervous of Torquil Ericsson\nCould it possibly be that  Turning abruptly to Peters she said\n\n\fI suppose he is Ericsson He couldnt be someone else\n\nPeters looked at her in astonishment.",
    "Someone else Who\n\nI mean  at least I think I mean  could he have come here\npretending to be Ericsson\n\nPeters considered.",
    "I suppose  no I dont think that would be feasible.",
    "Hed have to be\na scientist... and anyway Ericsson is quite well known.",
    "But nobody here seems ever to have met him before  or I suppose\nhe could be Ericsson but be someone else as well.",
    "You mean Ericsson could have been leading some kind of double\nlife Thats possible I suppose.",
    "But its not very likely.",
    "No said Hilary.",
    "No of course it isnt likely.",
    "Of course Ericsson was not Boris Glydr.",
    "But why should Olive\nBetterton have been so insistent on warning Tom against Boris\nCould it have been because she knew that Boris was on his way to\nthe Unit Supposing the man who had come to London calling\nhimself Boris Glydr was not Boris Glydr at all Supposing that he\nwas really Torquil Ericsson.",
    "The description fitted.",
    "Ever since he\narrived at the Unit he had focused his attention on Tom.",
    "Ericsson\n\n\fshe was sure was a dangerous person you didnt know what went\non behind those pale dreamy eyes...\n\nShe shivered.",
    "Olive  whats the matter What is it\n\nNothing.",
    "Look.",
    "The Deputy Director is going to make an\nannouncement\n\nDr. Neilson was holding up his hand for silence.",
    "He spoke into the\nmicrophone on the platform of the Hall.",
    "Friends and colleagues.",
    "Tomorrow you are asked to remain in the\nEmergency Wing.",
    "Please assemble at 1100 A.M. when there will be\nroll call.",
    "Emergency orders are for twentyfour hours only.",
    "I much\nregret the inconvenience.",
    "A notice has been pasted on the board.",
    "He retired smiling.",
    "The music began again.",
    "I must pursue the Jennsen again said Peters.",
    "I see her looking\nearnest by a pillar.",
    "I want to hear just what these Emergency\nquarters consist of.",
    "He moved away.",
    "Olive sat thinking.",
    "Was she an imaginative fool\nTorquil Ericsson Boris Glydr\n\nIV\n\n\fRoll call was in the big lecture room.",
    "Everyone was present and\nanswered to his or her name.",
    "Then they were marshalled into a long\ncolumn and marched off.",
    "The route was as usual through a maze of winding corridors.",
    "Olive walking by Peters knew that he had concealed in his hand a\ntiny compass.",
    "From this unobtrusively he was calculating their\ndirection.",
    "Not that it helps he observed ruefully in a low tone.",
    "Or at any\nrate it doesnt help at the moment.",
    "But it may do  some time.",
    "At the end of the corridor they were following was a door and there\nwas a momentary halt as the door was opened.",
    "Peters took out his cigarette case  but immediately Van Heidems\nvoice was raised peremptorily.",
    "No smoking please.",
    "That has already been told you.",
    "Sorry sir.",
    "Peters paused with the cigarette case in his hand.",
    "Then they all\nwent forward again.",
    "Just like sheep said Olive disgustedly.",
    "Cheer up Peter murmured.",
    "Baa baa black sheep is among the\nflock thinking up devilry hard.",
    "She flashed him a grateful glance and smiled.",
    "Womens dormitory to the right said Miss Jennsen.",
    "She\nshepherded the women off in the direction indicated.",
    "The men were fallen off to the left.",
    "The dormitory was a large room of hygiene appearance rather like\na hospital ward.",
    "It had beds along the walls with curtains of plastic\nmaterial that could be pulled for privacy.",
    "There was a locker by\neach bed.",
    "You will find arrangements rather simple said Miss Jennsen but\nnot too primitive.",
    "The bathroom accommodation is through there to\nthe right.",
    "The communal living room is through the door at the\nend.",
    "The communal living room where they all met again was plainly\nfurnished rather like an airport waiting room  there was a bar and\nsnack counter at one side.",
    "Along the other side was a row of book\nshelves.",
    "The day passed quite agreeably.",
    "There were two cinema\nperformances shown on a small portable screen.",
    "The lighting was of the daylight type which tended to obscure the\nfact that there were no windows.",
    "Towards evening a fresh set of\nbulbs came on  soft and discreet night lighting.",
    "Clever said Peters appreciatively.",
    "It all helps to minimize the\nfeeling of being walled up alive.",
    "How helpless they all were thought Hilary.",
    "Somewhere quite near\nthem were a party from the outside world.",
    "And there was no means\nof communicating with them of appealing for help.",
    "As usual\neverything had been ruthlessly and efficiently planned.",
    "Peters was sitting with Miss Jennsen.",
    "Hilary suggested to the\nMurchisons that they should play bridge.",
    "Tom Betterton refused.",
    "He said he couldnt concentrate but Dr. Barron made a fourth.",
    "Oddly enough Hilary found the game enjoyable.",
    "It was half past\neleven when their third rubber came to an end with herself and Dr.\nBarron the winners.",
    "I enjoyed that she said.",
    "She glanced at her watch.",
    "Its quite late.",
    "I suppose the V.I.P.s will have left now  or do they spend the night\nhere\n\nI dont really know said Simon Murchison.",
    "I believe one or two of\nthe specially keen medicos stay over.",
    "Anyway theyll all have gone\nby tomorrow midday.",
    "And thats when were put back in circulation\n\n\fYes.",
    "About time too.",
    "It upsets all ones routine this sort of thing.",
    "But it is well arranged said Bianca with approval.",
    "She and Hilary got up and said goodnight to the two men.",
    "Hilary stood back a little to allow Bianca to precede her into the\ndimly lit dormitory.",
    "As she did so she felt a soft touch on her arm.",
    "She turned sharply to find one of the tall dark faced servants\nstanding beside her.",
    "He spoke in a low urgent voice in French.",
    "Sil vous plait Madame you are to come.",
    "Come Come where\n\nIf you will please follow me.",
    "She stood irresolute for a moment.",
    "Bianca had gone on into the dormitory.",
    "In the communal living room\nthe few persons left were engaged in conversation with each other.",
    "Again she felt that soft urgent touch on her arm.",
    "You will follow me please Madame.",
    "He moved a few steps and stood looking back beckoning to her.",
    "A\nlittle doubtfully Hilary followed him.",
    "She noticed that this particular man was far more richly dressed\nthan most of the native servants.",
    "His robes were embroidered\nheavily with gold thread.",
    "He led her through a small door in a corner of the communal living\nroom then once more along the inevitable anonymous white\ncorridors.",
    "She did not think it was the same way by which they had\ncome to the Emergency Wing but it was always difficult to be sure\nbecause of the similarity of the passages.",
    "Once she turned to ask a\nquestion but the guide shook his head impatiently and hurried on.",
    "He stopped finally at the end of a corridor and pressed a button in\nthe wall.",
    "A panel slid back disclosing a small lift.",
    "He gestured her in\nfollowed her and the lift shot upwards.",
    "Hilary said sharply\n\nWhere are you taking me\n\nThe dark eyes held hers in a kind of dignified reproof.",
    "To the Master Madame.",
    "It is for you a great honor.",
    "To the Director you mean\n\nTo the Master...",
    "The lift stopped.",
    "He slid back the doors and motioned her out.",
    "Then\nthey walked down another corridor and arrived at a door.",
    "Her guide\nrapped on the door and it was opened from inside.",
    "Here again were\nwhite robes gold embroidery and a black impassive face.",
    "The man took Hilary across the small redcarpeted anteroom and\ndrew aside some hangings at the further side.",
    "Hilary passed\nthrough.",
    "She found herself unexpectedly in an almost oriental\ninterior.",
    "There were low couches coffee tables one or two\nbeautiful rugs hanging on the walls.",
    "Sitting on a low divan was a\nfigure at whom she stared with complete incredulity.",
    "Small yellow\nwrinkled old she stared unbelievingly into the smiling eyes of Mr.\nAristides.",
    "Chapter 18\n\nAsseyez vous ch\u00e8re Madame said Mr. Aristides.",
    "He waved a small clawlike hand and Hilary came forward in a\ndream and sat down upon another low divan opposite him.",
    "He gave\na gentle little cackle of laughter.",
    "You are surprised he said.",
    "It is not what you expected eh\n\nNo indeed said Hilary.",
    "I never thought  I never imagined \n\nBut already her surprise was subsiding.",
    "With her recognition of Mr. Aristides the dream world of unreality\nin which she had been living for the past weeks shattered and\nbroke.",
    "She knew now that the Unit had seemed unreal to her because it was unreal.",
    "It had never been what it pretended to be.",
    "The Herr Director with his spellbinders voice had been unreal too a mere figurehead of fiction set up to obscure the truth.",
    "The truth\nwas here in this secret oriental room.",
    "A little old man sitting there\nand laughing quietly.",
    "With Mr. Aristides in the centre of the picture\neverything made sense  hard practical everyday sense.",
    "I see now said Hilary.",
    "This  is all yours isnt it\n\nYes Madame.",
    "And the Director The socalled Director\n\nHe is very good said Mr. Aristides appreciatively.",
    "I pay him a\nvery high salary.",
    "He used to run Revivalist meetings.",
    "He smoked thoughtfully for a moment or two.",
    "Hilary did not speak.",
    "There is Turkish Delight beside you Madame.",
    "And other\nsweetmeats if you prefer them.",
    "Again there was silence.",
    "Then he\nwent on I am a philanthropist Madame.",
    "As you know I am rich.",
    "One of the richest men  possibly the richest man in the world\ntoday.",
    "With my wealth I feel under the obligation to serve humanity.",
    "I have established here in this remote spot a colony of lepers and\na vast assembly of research into the problem of the cure of leprosy.",
    "Certain types of leprosy are curable.",
    "Others so far have proved\nincurable.",
    "But all the time we are working and obtaining good\n\n\fresults.",
    "Leprosy is not really such an easily communicated disease.",
    "It is not half so infectious or so contagious as smallpox or typhus or\nplague or any of these other things.",
    "And yet if you say to people a\nleper colony they will shudder and give it a wide berth.",
    "It is an old\nold fear that.",
    "A fear that you can find in the Bible and which has\nexisted all down through the years.",
    "The horror of the leper.",
    "It has\nbeen useful to me in establishing this place.",
    "You established it for that reason\n\nYes.",
    "We have here also a Cancer Research department and\nimportant work is being done on tuberculosis.",
    "There is virus\nresearch also  for curative reasons bien entendu  biological\nwarfare is not mentioned.",
    "All humane all acceptable all\nrebounding greatly to my honour.",
    "Wellknown physicians surgeons\nand research chemists come here to see our results from time to\ntime as they have come today.",
    "The building has been cunningly\nconstructed in such a way that a part of it is shut off and\nunapparent even from the air.",
    "The more secret laboratories have\nbeen tunnelled right into the rock.",
    "In any case I am above\nsuspicion.",
    "He smiled and added simply I am so very rich you\nsee.",
    "But why demanded Hilary.",
    "Why this urge for destruction\n\nI have no urge for destruction Madame.",
    "You wrong me.",
    "But then  I simply dont understand.",
    "I am a business man said Mr. Aristides simply.",
    "I am also a\ncollector.",
    "When wealth becomes oppressive that is the only thing\nto do.",
    "I have collected many things in my time.",
    "Pictures  I have the\nfinest art collection in Europe.",
    "Certain kinds of ceramics.",
    "Philately my stamp collection is famous.",
    "When a collection is fully\nrepresentative one goes on to the next thing.",
    "I am an old man\nMadame and there was not very much more for me to collect.",
    "So I\ncame at last to collecting brains.",
    "Brains Hilary queried.",
    "He nodded gently.",
    "Yes it is the most interesting thing to collect of all.",
    "Little by little\nMadame I am assembling here all the brains of the world.",
    "The\nyoung men those are the ones I am bringing here.",
    "Young men of\npromise young men of achievement.",
    "One day the tired nations of\nthe world will wake up and realise that their scientists are old and\nstale and that the young brains of the world  the doctors the\nresearch chemists the physicists the surgeons are all here in my\nkeeping.",
    "And if they want a scientist or a plastic surgeon or a\nbiologist they will have to come and buy him from me\n\nYou mean... Hilary leaned forward staring at him.",
    "You mean that\nthis is all a gigantic financial operation\n\nAgain Mr. Aristides nodded gently.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Naturally.",
    "Otherwise  it would not make sense\nwould it\n\n\fHilary gave a deep sigh.",
    "No she said.",
    "Thats just what Ive felt.",
    "After all you see said Mr. Aristides almost apologetically it is\nmy profession.",
    "I am a financier.",
    "And you mean there is no political side to this at all You dont\nwant World Power \n\nHe threw up his hand in rebuke.",
    "I do not want to be God he said.",
    "I am a religious man.",
    "That is the\noccupational disease of Dictators wanting to be God.",
    "So far I have\nnot contracted that disease.",
    "He reflected a moment and said It\nmay come.",
    "Yes it may come...",
    "But as yet mercifully  no.",
    "But how do you get all these people to come here\n\nI buy them Madame.",
    "In the open market.",
    "Like any other\nmerchandise.",
    "Sometimes I buy them with money.",
    "More often I buy\nthem with ideas.",
    "Young men are dreamers.",
    "They have ideals.",
    "They\nhave beliefs.",
    "Sometimes I buy them with safety  those that have\ntransgressed the law.",
    "That explains it said Hilary.",
    "Explains I mean what puzzled me\nso on the journey here.",
    "Ah It puzzled you on the journey did it\n\n\fYes.",
    "The difference in aims.",
    "Andy Peters the American seemed\ncompletely Left Wing.",
    "But Ericsson was a fanatical believer in the\nSuperman.",
    "And Helga Needheim was a Fascist of the most arrogant\nand Pagan kind.",
    "Dr. Barron  she hesitated.",
    "Yes he came for money said Aristides.",
    "Dr. Barron is civilised\nand cynical.",
    "He has no illusions but he has a genuine love of his\nwork.",
    "He wanted unlimited money so as to pursue his researches\nfurther.",
    "He added You are intelligent Madame.",
    "I saw that at once\nin Fez.",
    "He gave a gentle little cackle of laughter.",
    "You did not know it Madame but I went to Fez simply to observe\nyou  or rather I had you brought to Fez in order that I might\nobserve you.",
    "I see said Hilary.",
    "She noted the oriental rephrasing of the sentence.",
    "I was pleased to think that you would be coming here.",
    "For if you\nunderstand me I do not find many intelligent people in this place to\ntalk to.",
    "He made a gesture.",
    "These scientists these biologists\nthese research chemists they are not interesting.",
    "They are\ngeniuses perhaps at what they do but they are uninteresting\npeople with whom to converse.",
    "Their wives he added thoughtfully are usually very dull too.",
    "We\ndo not encourage wives here.",
    "I permit wives to come for only one\nreason.",
    "What reason\n\nMr. Aristides said drily\n\nIn the rare cases where a husband is unable to do his work\nproperly because he is thinking too much of his wife.",
    "That seemed\nto be the case with your husband Thomas Betterton.",
    "Thomas\nBetterton is known to the world as a young man of genius but since\nhe has been here he has done only mediocre and second class\nwork.",
    "Yes Betterton has disappointed me.",
    "But dont you find that constantly happening These people are\nafter all in prison here.",
    "Surely they rebel At first at any rate\n\nYes Mr. Aristides agreed.",
    "That is only natural and inevitable.",
    "It\nis so when you first cage a bird.",
    "But if the bird is in a big enough\naviary if it has all that it needs a mate seed water twigs all the\nmaterial of life it forgets in the end that it was ever free.",
    "Hilary shivered a little.",
    "You frighten me she said.",
    "You really frighten me.",
    "You will grow to understand many things here Madame.",
    "Let me\nassure you that though all these men of different ideologies arrive\n\n\fhere and are disillusioned and rebellious they will all toe the line in\nthe end.",
    "You cant be sure of that said Hilary.",
    "One can be absolutely sure of nothing in this world.",
    "I agree with\nyou there.",
    "But it is a ninetyfive per cent certainty all the same.",
    "Hilary looked at him with something like horror.",
    "Its dreadful she said.",
    "Its like a typists pool Youve got a pool\nhere of brains.",
    "Exactly.",
    "You put it very justly Madame.",
    "And from this pool you intend one day to supply scientists to\nwhoever pays you best for them\n\nThat is roughly the general principle Madame.",
    "But you cant send out a scientist just as you can send out a\ntypist.",
    "Why not\n\nBecause once your scientist is in the free world again he could\nrefuse to work for his new employer.",
    "He would be free again.",
    "True up to a point.",
    "There may have to be a certain  conditioning\nshall we say\n\n\fConditioning  what do you mean by that\n\nYou have heard of lobotomy Madame\n\nHilary frowned.",
    "Thats a brain operation isnt it\n\nBut yes.",
    "It was devised originally for the curing of melancholia.",
    "I\nput it to you not in medical terms Madame but in such terms as you\nand I understand.",
    "After the operation the patient has no more\ndesire to commit suicide no further feelings of guilt.",
    "He is carefree\nconscienceless and in most cases obedient.",
    "It hasnt been a hundred per cent success has it\n\nIn the past no.",
    "But here we have made great strides in the\ninvestigation of the subject.",
    "I have here three surgeons one\nRussian one Frenchman and an Austrian.",
    "By various operations of\ngrafting and delicate manipulation of the brain they are arriving\ngradually at a state where docility can be assured and the will can\nbe controlled without necessarily affecting mental brilliance.",
    "It\nseems possible that we may in the end so condition a human being\nthat while his powers of intellect remain unimpaired he will exhibit\nperfect docility.",
    "Any suggestion made to him he will accept.",
    "But thats horrible cried Hilary.",
    "Horrible\n\nHe corrected her serenely.",
    "It is useful.",
    "It is even in some ways beneficent.",
    "For the patient will\nbe happy contented without fears or longings or unrest.",
    "I dont believe it will ever happen said Hilary defiantly.",
    "Ch\u00e8re Madame forgive me if I say you are hardly competent to\nspeak on the subject.",
    "What I mean is said Hilary that I do not believe a contented\nsuggestible animal will ever produce creative work of real\nbrilliance.",
    "Aristides shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "You are intelligent.",
    "You may have something there.",
    "Time\nwill show.",
    "Experiments are going on all the time.",
    "Experiments On human beings do you mean\n\nBut certainly.",
    "That is the only practical method.",
    "But  what human beings\n\nThere are always the misfits said Aristides.",
    "The ones who do not\nadapt themselves to life here who will not cooperate.",
    "They make\ngood experimental material.",
    "Hilary dug her fingers into the cushions of the divan.",
    "She felt a deep\nhorror of this smiling yellowfaced little man with his inhuman\n\n\foutlook.",
    "Everything he said was so reasonable so logical and so\nbusinesslike that it made the horror worse.",
    "Here was no raving\nmadman just a man to whom his fellow creatures were so much\nraw material.",
    "Dont you believe in God she said.",
    "Naturally I believe in God.",
    "Mr. Aristides raised his eyebrows.",
    "His\ntone was almost shocked.",
    "I have told you already.",
    "I am a religious\nman.",
    "God has blessed me with supreme power.",
    "With money and\nopportunity.",
    "Do you read your Bible asked Hilary.",
    "Certainly Madame.",
    "Do you remember what Moses and Aaron said to Pharaoh Let my\npeople go.",
    "He smiled.",
    "So  I am Pharaoh  And you are Moses and Aaron in one Is that\nwhat you are saying to me Madame To let these people go all of\nthem or just  one special case\n\nId like to say  all of them said Hilary.",
    "But you are well aware ch\u00e8re Madame he said that that would\nbe a waste of time.",
    "So instead it is not your husband for whom you\nplead\n\n\fHe is no good to you said Hilary.",
    "Surely by now you must realise\nthat.",
    "Perhaps it is true what you say Madame.",
    "Yes I am very much\ndisappointed in Thomas Betterton.",
    "I hoped that your presence here\nmight restore him to his brilliance for undoubtedly he has\nbrilliance.",
    "His reputation in America leaves no doubt as to that.",
    "But\nyour coming seems to have had little or no effect.",
    "I speak not of my\nown knowledge of course but from the reports of those fitted to\nknow.",
    "His brother scientists who have been working with him.",
    "He\nshrugged his shoulders.",
    "He does conscientious mediocre work.",
    "No more.",
    "There are birds that cannot sing in captivity.",
    "said Hilary.",
    "Perhaps there are scientists who cannot attain creative thought\nunder certain circumstances.",
    "You must admit that that is a\nreasonable possibility.",
    "It may be so.",
    "I do not deny it\n\nThen write off Thomas Betterton as one of your failures.",
    "Let him\nreturn to the outer world.",
    "That would hardly do.",
    "Madame.",
    "I am not yet prepared to have\nknowledge of this place broadcast to the globe.",
    "You could swear him to secrecy.",
    "He would swear never to breathe\na word.",
    "He would swear  yes.",
    "But he would not keep that word.",
    "He would Oh indeed he would\n\nThere speaks a wife One cannot take the word of wives on this\npoint.",
    "Of course he leaned back in his chair and brought the tips\nof his yellow fingers together of course he might leave a hostage\nbehind him and that might tie his tongue.",
    "You mean\n\nI mean you Madame...",
    "If Thomas Betterton went and you\nremained as a hostage how would that bargain strike you Would\nyou be willing\n\nHilary stared past him into the shadows.",
    "Mr. Aristides could not\nknow the pictures that rose before her eyes.",
    "She was back in a\nhospital room sitting by a dying woman.",
    "She was listening to\nJessop and memorising his instructions.",
    "If there was a chance\nnow that Thomas Betterton might go free whilst she remained\nwould not that be the best way to fulfill her mission For she knew\nwhat Mr. Aristides did not that there would be no hostage in the\nusual meaning of the word left behind.",
    "She herself meant nothing\nto Thomas Betterton.",
    "The wife he had loved was already dead.",
    "She raised her head and looked across at the little old man on the\ndivan.",
    "I should be willing she said.",
    "You have courage Madame and loyalty and devotion.",
    "They are\ngood qualities.",
    "For the rest  He smiled.",
    "We will talk of it again\nsome other time.",
    "Oh no no Hilary suddenly buried her face in her hands.",
    "Her\nshoulders shook.",
    "I cant bear it I cant bear it Its all too inhuman.",
    "You must not mind so much Madame.",
    "The old mans voice was\ntender almost soothing.",
    "It has pleased me tonight to tell you my\naims and my aspirations.",
    "It has been interesting to me to see the\neffect upon a mind totally unprepared.",
    "A mind like yours well\nbalanced sane and intelligent You are horrified.",
    "You are repulsed.",
    "Yet I think that to shock you in this way is a wise plan.",
    "At first you\nrepel the idea then you think of it you reflect on it and in the end it\nwill seem to you natural as though it has always existed a\ncommonplace.",
    "Never that cried Hilary.",
    "Never that Never Never\n\nAh said Mr. Aristides.",
    "There speaks the passion and the\nrebellion that go with red hair.",
    "My second wife he added\nreflectively had red hair.",
    "She was a beautiful woman and she\nloved me.",
    "Strange is it not I have always admired redhaired\nwomen.",
    "Your hair is very beautiful.",
    "There are other things I like\nabout you.",
    "Your spirit your courage the fact that you have a mind\nof your own.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Alas Women as women interest me very\nlittle nowadays.",
    "I have a couple of young girls here who please me\nsometimes but it is the stimulus of mental companionship that I\nnow prefer.",
    "Believe me Madame your company has refreshed me\ngreatly.",
    "Supposing I repeat all that you have told me to my husband\n\nAristides smiled indulgently.",
    "Ah yes supposing you do But will you\n\nI dont know.",
    "I  oh I dont know.",
    "Ah said Mr. Aristides.",
    "You are wise.",
    "There is some knowledge\nwomen should keep to themselves.",
    "But you are tired  and upset.",
    "From time to time when I pay my visits here you shall be brought to\nme and we will discuss many things.",
    "Let me leave this place  Hilary stretched her hands out to him.",
    "Oh let me go away.",
    "Let me leave with you when you go.",
    "Please\nPlease\n\nHe shook his head gently.",
    "His expression was indulgent but there\nwas a faint touch of contempt behind it.",
    "Now you are talking like a child he said reprovingly.",
    "How could I\nlet you go How could I let you spread the story round the world of\nwhat you have seen here\n\nWouldnt you believe me if I swore I wouldnt say a word to\nanyone\n\nNo indeed I should not believe you said Mr. Aristides.",
    "I should\nbe very foolish if I believed anything of the kind.",
    "I dont want to be here.",
    "I dont want to stay here in this prison.",
    "I\nwant to get out.",
    "But you have your husband.",
    "You came here to join him\ndeliberately of your own free will.",
    "But I didnt know what I was coming to.",
    "Id no idea.",
    "No said Mr. Aristides you had no idea.",
    "But I can assure you this\nparticular world you have come to is a much pleasanter world than\nthe life beyond the Iron Curtain.",
    "Here you have everything you\nneed Luxury a beautiful climate distractions...",
    "He got up and patted her gently on the shoulder.",
    "You will settle down he said confidently.",
    "Ah yes the redheaded bird in the cage will settle down.",
    "In a year in two years\ncertainly you will be very happy Though possibly he added\nthoughtfully less interesting.",
    "Chapter 19\n\nHilary awoke the following night with a start.",
    "She raised herself on\nher elbow listening.",
    "Tom do you hear\n\n\fYes.",
    "Aircraft  flying low.",
    "Nothing in that.",
    "They come over from time\nto time.",
    "I wondered  She did not finish her sentence.",
    "She lay awake thinking going over and over that strange interview\nwith Aristides.",
    "The old man had got some kind of capricious liking for her.",
    "Could she play upon that\n\nCould she in the end prevail upon him to take her with him out into\nthe world again\n\nNext time he came if he sent for her she would lead him on to talk\nof his dead redhaired wife.",
    "It was not the lure of the flesh that\nwould captivate him.",
    "His blood ran too coldly now in his veins for\nthat.",
    "Besides he had his young girls.",
    "But the old like to remember\nto be urged on to talk of times gone by...\n\nUncle George who had lived at Cheltenham...\n\nHilary smiled in the darkness remembering Uncle George.",
    "Were Uncle George and Aristides the man of millions really very\ndifferent under the skin Uncle George had had a housekeeper such a nice safe woman my dear not flashy or sexy or anything\nlike that.",
    "Nice and plain and safe.",
    "But Uncle George had upset his\n\n\ffamily by marrying that nice plain woman.",
    "She had been a very\ngood listener...\n\nWhat had Hilary said to Tom Ill find a way of getting out of here\nOdd if the way should prove to be Aristides...\n\nII\n\nA message said Leblanc.",
    "A message at last.",
    "His orderly had just entered and after saluting had laid a folded\npaper before him.",
    "He unfolded it then spoke excitedly.",
    "This is a report from one of our reconnaissance pilots.",
    "He has\nbeen operating over one of the selected squares of territory.",
    "When\nflying over a certain position in a mountainous region he observed a\nsignal being flashed.",
    "It was in Morse and was twice repeated.",
    "Here\nit is.",
    "He laid the enclosure before Jessop.",
    "C.O.G.L.E.P.R.O.S.I.E.S.L.",
    "He separated off the last two letters with a pencil.",
    "SL  that is our code for Do not acknowledge.",
    "And COG with which the message starts said Jessop is our\nrecognition signal.",
    "Then the rest is the actual message.",
    "He underlined it.",
    "LEPROSIE.",
    "He surveyed it dubiously.",
    "Leprosy said Jessop.",
    "And what does that mean\n\nHave you any important Leper Settlements Or unimportant ones\nfor that matter\n\nLeblanc spread out a large map in front of him.",
    "He pointed with a\nstubby forefinger stained with nicotine.",
    "Here he marked it off is the area over which our pilot was\noperating.",
    "Let me see now.",
    "I seem to recall...",
    "He left the room.",
    "Presently he returned.",
    "I have it he said.",
    "There is a very famous medical Research\nstation founded and endowed by well known philanthropists and\noperating in that area  a very deserted one by the way.",
    "Valuable\nwork has been done there in the study of Leprosy.",
    "There is a Leper\nSettlement there of about two hundred people.",
    "There is also a\nCancer Research station and a Tubercular Sanatorium.",
    "But\nunderstand this it is all of the highest authenticity.",
    "Its reputation is\nof the highest.",
    "The President of the Republic himself is its Patron.",
    "Yes said Jessop appreciatively.",
    "Very nice work in fact.",
    "But it is open to inspection at any time.",
    "Medical men who are\ninterested in these subjects visit there.",
    "And see nothing they ought not to see Why should they There is\nno better camouflage for dubious business than an atmosphere of\nthe highest respectability.",
    "It could be Leblanc said dubiously I suppose a halting place\nfor parties of people bound on a journey.",
    "One or two of the midEuropean doctors perhaps have managed to arrange something\nlike that.",
    "A small party of people like the one we are tracking could\nlie perdu there for a few weeks before continuing their journey.",
    "I think it might be something more than that said Jessop.",
    "I think\nit might be  Journeys End.",
    "You think it is something  big\n\nA Leper Settlement seems to me very suggestive...",
    "I believe under\nmodern treatment leprosy nowadays is treated at home.",
    "In civilised communities perhaps.",
    "But one could not do that in this\ncountry.",
    "No.",
    "But the word Leprosy still has its association with the Middle\nAges when the Leper carried his bell to warn away people from his\npath.",
    "Idle curiosity does not bring people to a Leper Settlement the\npeople who come are as you say the medical profession\n\n\finterested only in the medical research done there and possibly\nthe social worker anxious to report on the conditions under which\nthe Lepers live  all of which are no doubt admirable.",
    "Behind that\nfa\u0437ade of philanthropy and charity  anything might go on.",
    "Who by\nthe way owns the place Who are the philanthropists who\nendowed it and set it up\n\nThat is easily ascertained.",
    "A little minute.",
    "He turned shortly an official reference book in his hand.",
    "It was established by private enterprise.",
    "By a group of\nphilanthropists of whom the chief is Aristides.",
    "As you know he is a\nman of fabulous wealth and gives generously to charitable\nenterprises.",
    "He has founded hospitals in Paris and also in Seville.",
    "This is to all intents and purposes his show  the other benefactors\nare a group of his associates.",
    "So  its an Aristides enterprise.",
    "And Aristides was in Fez when\nOlive Betterton was there.",
    "Aristides Leblanc savoured the full implication.",
    "Mais  cest\ncolossal\n\nYes.",
    "Cest fantastique\n\nQuite.",
    "Enfin  cest formidable\n\nDefinitely.",
    "But do you realise how formidable it is Leblanc shook an excited\nforefinger in the others face.",
    "This Aristides he has a finger in\nevery pie.",
    "He is behind nearly everything.",
    "The banks the\nGovernment the manufacturing industries armaments transport\nOne never sees him one hardly hears of him He sits in a warm\nroom in his Spanish castle smoking and sometimes he scrawls a\nfew words on a little piece of paper and throws it on the ground\nand a secretary crawls forward and picks it up and a few days later\nan important banker in Paris blows his brains out It is like that\n\nHow wonderfully dramatic you are Leblanc.",
    "But it is really not\nvery\n\nsurprising.",
    "Presidents\n\nand\n\nMinisters\n\nmake\n\nimportant\n\npronouncements bankers sit back behind their sumptuous desks\nand roll out opulent statements  but one is never surprised to find\nout that behind the importance and magnificence there is\nsomewhere some scrubby little man who is the real motive power.",
    "It is really not at all surprising to find that Aristides is behind all this\ndisappearing business  in fact if wed had any sense wed have\nthought of it before.",
    "The whole things a vast commercial ramp.",
    "Its\nnot political at all.",
    "The question is he added What are we going\nto do about it\n\nLeblancs face grew gloomy.",
    "It is not going to be easy you understand.",
    "It we are wrong  I dare\nnot think of it And even if we are right  we have got to prove we are\n\n\fright.",
    "If we make investigations  those investigations can be called\noff  at the highest level you understand No it is not going to be\neasy...",
    "But he wagged an emphatic stubby forefinger it will be\ndone.",
    "Chapter 20\n\nThe cars swept up the mountain road and stopped in front of the\ngreat gate set in the rock.",
    "There were four cars.",
    "In the first car was\na French Minister and the American Ambassador in the second car\nwas the British Consul a Member of Parliament and the Chief of\nPolice.",
    "In the third car were two members of a former Royal\nCommission and two distinguished journalists.",
    "The complement of\nthese three cars was made up with the necessary satellites.",
    "The\nfourth car contained certain people not known to the general\npublic but sufficiently distinguished in their own sphere.",
    "They\nincluded Captain Leblanc and Mr. Jessop.",
    "The chauffeurs\nimmaculately garbed were now opening car doors and bowing as\nthey assisted the distinguished visitors to alight.",
    "One hopes murmured the Minister apprehensively that there\nwill be no possibility of a contact of any kind.",
    "One of the satellites immediately made soothing noises.",
    "Du tout M. le Ministre.",
    "Every suitable precaution is taken.",
    "One\ninspects only from a distance.",
    "The Minister who was elderly and apprehensive looked relieved.",
    "The Ambassador said something about the better understanding\nand treatment of these diseases nowadays.",
    "The great gates were flung open.",
    "On the threshold stood a small\nparty bowing to welcome them.",
    "The Director dark thickset the\nDeputy Director big and fair two distinguished doctors and a\ndistinguished Research Chemist.",
    "The greetings were French florid\nand prolonged.",
    "And ce cher Aristides demanded the Minister.",
    "I sincerely hope\nill health has not prevented him from fulfilling his promise to meet\nus here.",
    "M. Aristides flew from Spain yesterday said the Deputy Director.",
    "He awaits you within.",
    "Permit me Your Excellency  M. le Ministre\nto lead the way.",
    "The party followed him.",
    "M. le Ministre who was slightly\napprehensive glanced through the heavy railings to his right.",
    "The\nlepers were drawn up to attention in a serried row as far as\npossible from the grating.",
    "The Minister looked relieved.",
    "His feelings\nabout leprosy were still mediaeval.",
    "In the well furnished modern lounge Mr. Aristides was awaiting his\nguests.",
    "There were bows compliments introductions.",
    "Aperitifs\nwere served by the darkfaced servants dressed in their white\nrobes and turbans.",
    "Its a wonderful place you have here sir said one of the younger\njournalists to Aristides.",
    "The latter made one of his Oriental gestures.",
    "I am proud of this place he said.",
    "It is as you might say my swan\nsong.",
    "My final gift to humanity.",
    "No expense has been spared.",
    "Ill say thats so said one of the doctors on the staff heartily.",
    "This place is a professional mans dream.",
    "We do pretty well in the\nStates but what Ive seen since I came here... and were getting\nresults Yes sir we certainly are getting results.",
    "His enthusiasm was of a contagious kind.",
    "We must make all acknowledgements to private enterprise said\nthe Ambassador bowing politely to Mr. Aristides.",
    "Mr. Aristides spoke with humility.",
    "God has been very good to me he said.",
    "Sitting hunched up in his chair he looked like a small yellow toad.",
    "The Member of Parliament murmured to the member of the Royal\nCommission who was very old and deaf that he presented a very\ninteresting paradox.",
    "That old rascal has probably ruined millions of people he\nmurmured and having made so much money he doesnt know\nwhat to do with it so he pays it back with the other hand.",
    "The elderly judge to whom he spoke murmured\n\nOne wonders to what extent results justify increased expenditure.",
    "Most of the great discoveries that have benefited the human race\nhave been discovered with quite simple equipment.",
    "And now said Aristides when the civilities were accomplished\nand the aperitifs drunk you will honor me by partaking of a simple\nrepast which awaits you.",
    "Dr. Van Heidem will act as your host.",
    "I\nmyself am on a diet and eat very little these days.",
    "After the repast\nyou will start on your tour of our building.",
    "Under the leadership of the genial Dr. Van Heidem the guests\nmoved enthusiastically into the dining room.",
    "They had had two\nhours flight followed by an hours drive by car and they were all\nsharp set.",
    "The food was delicious and was commented on with\nspecial approval by the Minister.",
    "We enjoy our modest comforts said Van Heidem.",
    "Fresh fruit and\nvegetables are flown to us twice a week arrangements are made\nfor meat and chicken and we have of course substantial deep\nfreezing units.",
    "The body must claim its due from the resources of\nscience.",
    "The meal was accompanied by choice vintages.",
    "After it Turkish\ncoffee was served.",
    "The party was then asked to start on its tour of\ninspection.",
    "The tour took two hours and was most comprehensive.",
    "The Minister for one was glad when it finished.",
    "He was quite dazed\nby the gleaming laboratories the endless white shining corridors\n\n\fand still more dazed by the mass of scientific detail handed out to\nhim.",
    "Though the Ministers interest was perfunctory some of the others\nwere more searching in their enquiries.",
    "Some curiosity was\ndisplayed as to the living conditions of the personnel and various\nother details.",
    "Dr. Van Heidem showed himself only too willing to\nshow the guests all there was to see.",
    "Leblanc and Jessop the\nformer in attendance on the Minister and the latter accompanying\nthe British Consul fell a little behind the others as they all returned\nto the lounge.",
    "There is no trace here nothing murmured Leblanc in an agitated\nmanner.",
    "Not a sign.",
    "Mon cher if we have as your saying is barked up the wrong tree\nwhat a catastrophe.",
    "After the weeks it has taken to arrange all this\nAs for me  it will finish my career.",
    "Were not licked yet said Jessop.",
    "Our friends are here Im sure\nof it.",
    "There is no trace of them.",
    "Of course there is no trace.",
    "They could not afford to have a trace\nof them.",
    "For these official visits everything is prepared and\narranged.",
    "Then how are we to get our evidence I tell you without evidence\nno one will move in the matter.",
    "They are sceptical all of them.",
    "The\nMinister the American Ambassador the British Consul  they say\nall of them that a man like Aristides is above suspicion.",
    "Keep calm Leblanc keep calm.",
    "I tell you were not licked yet.",
    "Leblanc shrugged his shoulders.",
    "You have the optimism my friend he said.",
    "He turned for a\nmoment to speak to one of the immaculately arrayed moonfaced\nyoung men who formed part of the entourage then turned back to\nJessop and asked suspiciously Why are you smiling\n\nHeard of a Geiger counter\n\nNaturally.",
    "But I am not a scientist you understand.",
    "No more am I.",
    "It is a very sensitive detector of radioactivity.",
    "And so\n\nOur friends are here.",
    "The Geiger counter tells me that it imparts a\nmessage to say that our friends are here.",
    "This building has been\npurposely built in a confusing manner.",
    "All the corridors and the\nrooms so resemble each other that it is difficult to know where one\nis or what the plan of the building can be.",
    "There is a part of this\nplace that we have not seen.",
    "It has not been shown to us.",
    "But you deduce that it is there because of some radioactive\nindication\n\nExactly.",
    "In fact it is the pearls of Madame all over again\n\nYes.",
    "Were still playing Hansel and Gretel as you might say.",
    "But\nthe signs left here cannot be so apparent or so crude as the beads\nof a pearl necklace or a hand of phosphoric paint.",
    "They cannot be\nseen but they can be sensed... by our radioactive detector \n\nBut mon Dieu Jessop is that enough\n\nIt should be.",
    "said Jessop.",
    "What one is afraid of...",
    "He broke off.",
    "Leblanc finished the sentence for him.",
    "What you mean is that these people will not want to believe.",
    "They\nhave been unwilling from the start.",
    "Oh yes that is so.",
    "Even your\nBritish Consul is a man of caution.",
    "Your government at home is\nindebted to Aristides in many ways.",
    "As for our government he\nshrugged his shoulders.",
    "M. le Ministre I know will be exceedingly\nhard to convince.",
    "We\n\nwont\n\nput\n\nour\n\nfaith\n\nin\n\ngovernments\n\nsaid\n\nJessop.",
    "Governments and diplomats have their hands tied.",
    "But weve got\nto have them here because theyre the only ones with authority.",
    "But as far as believing is concerned Im pinning my faith\nelsewhere.",
    "And on what in particular do you pin your faith my friend\n\nJessops solemn face suddenly relaxed into a grin.",
    "Theres the press he said.",
    "Journalists have a nose for news.",
    "They dont want it hushed up.",
    "Theyre ready always to believe\nanything that remotely can be believed.",
    "The other person I have\nfaith in he went on is that very deaf old man.",
    "Aha I know the one you mean.",
    "The one who looks as though he\ncrumbles to his grave.",
    "Yes hes deaf and infirm and semiblind.",
    "But hes interested in\ntruth.",
    "Hes a former Lord Chief Justice and though he may be deaf\nand blind and shaky on his legs his minds as keen as ever  hes\ngot that keen sense that legal luminaries acquire  of knowing when\ntheres something fishy about and someones trying to prevent it\nbeing brought into the open.",
    "Hes a man wholl listen and will want\nto listen to evidence.",
    "They had arrived back now in the lounge.",
    "Both tea and aperitifs\nwere provided.",
    "The Minister congratulated Mr. Aristides in wellrounded periods.",
    "The American Ambassador added his quota.",
    "It\nwas then that the Minister looking round him said in a slightly\nnervous tone of voice\n\nAnd now gentlemen I think the time has come for us to leave our\nkind host.",
    "We have seen all there is to see... his tone dwelt on\nthose last words with some significance all here is magnificent.",
    "An establishment of the first class We are most grateful for the\nhospitality of our kind host and we congratulate him on the\nachievement here.",
    "So we say our farewells now and depart.",
    "I am\nright am I not\n\nThe words were in a sense conventional enough.",
    "The manner too\nwas conventional.",
    "The glance that swept round the assembly of\nguests might have been no more than courtesy.",
    "Yet in actuality the\nwords were a plea.",
    "In effect the Minister was saying Youve seen\ngentlemen there is nothing here nothing of what you suspected\nand feared.",
    "That is a great relief and we can now leave with a clear\nconscience.",
    "But in the silence a voice spoke.",
    "It was the quiet deferential wellbred English voice of Mr. Jessop.",
    "He spoke to the Minister  in a\nBritannic though idiomatic French.",
    "With your permission Sir he said and if I may do so I would like\nto ask a favour of our kind host.",
    "Certainly certainly.",
    "Of course Mr.  ah  Mr. Jessop  yes yes\n\nJessop addressed himself solemnly to Dr. Van Heidem.",
    "He did not\nlook ostensibly to Mr. Aristides.",
    "Weve met so many of your people he said Quite bewildering.",
    "But theres an old friend of mine here that Id rather like to have a\nword with.",
    "I wonder if it could be arranged before I go\n\nA friend of yours Dr. Van Heidem said politely surprised.",
    "Well two friends really said Jessop.",
    "Theres a woman Mrs.\nBetterton.",
    "Olive Betterton.",
    "I believe her husbands working here.",
    "Tom Betterton.",
    "Used to be at Harwell and before that in America.",
    "Id very much like to have a word with them both before I go.",
    "Dr. Van Heidems reactions were perfect.",
    "His eyes opened in wide\nand polite surprise.",
    "He frowned in a puzzled way.",
    "Betterton  Mrs. Betterton  no Im afraid we have no one of that\nname here.",
    "Theres an American too said Jessop.",
    "Andrew Peters.",
    "Research chemistry I believe is his line.",
    "Im right sir arent I He\nturned deferentially to the American Ambassador.",
    "The Ambassador was a shrewd middleaged man with keen blue\neyes.",
    "He was a man of character as well as diplomatic ability.",
    "His\neyes met Jessops.",
    "He took a full minute to decide and then he\nspoke.",
    "Why yes he said.",
    "Thats so.",
    "Andrew Peters.",
    "Id like to see him.",
    "Van Heidems polite bewilderment grew.",
    "Jessop unobtrusively shot\na quick glance at Aristides.",
    "The little yellow face betrayed no\nknowledge of anything amiss no surprise no disquietude.",
    "He\nlooked merely uninterested.",
    "Andrew Peters No Im afraid Your Excellency youve got your\nfacts wrong.",
    "Weve no one of that name here.",
    "Im afraid I dont even\nknow the name.",
    "You know the name of Thomas Betterton dont you said Jessop.",
    "Just for a second Van Heidem hesitated.",
    "His head turned very\nslightly towards the old man in the chair but he caught himself\nback in time.",
    "Thomas Betterton he said.",
    "Why yes I think \n\nOne of the gentlemen of the press spoke up quickly on that cue.",
    "Thomas Betterton he said.",
    "Why I should say he was pretty well\nbig news.",
    "Big news six months ago when he disappeared.",
    "Why hes\nmade headlines in the papers all over Europe.",
    "The police have been\nlooking for him here there and everywhere.",
    "Do you mean to say\nhes been here in this place all the time\n\nNo.",
    "Van Heidem spoke sharply.",
    "Someone I fear has been\nmisinforming you.",
    "A hoax perhaps.",
    "You have seen today all our\nworkers at the Unit.",
    "You have seen everything.",
    "Not quite everything I think said Jessop quietly.",
    "Theres a\nyoung man called Ericsson too he added and Dr. Louis Barron\nand possibly Mrs. Calvin Baker.",
    "Ah.",
    "Dr. Van Heidem seemed to receive enlightenment.",
    "But those\npeople were killed in Morocco  in a plane crash.",
    "I remember it\n\n\fperfectly now.",
    "At least I remember Ericsson was in the crash and\nDr. Louis Barron.",
    "Ah France sustained a great loss that day.",
    "A man\nsuch as Louis Barron is hard to replace.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "I do\nnot know anything about a Mrs. Calvin Baker but I do seem to\nremember that there was an English or American woman on that\nplane.",
    "It might well perhaps have been this Mrs. Betterton of whom\nyou speak.",
    "Yes it was all very sad.",
    "He looked across enquiringly at\nJessop.",
    "I do not know Monsieur why you should suppose that\nthese people were coming here.",
    "It may possibly be that Dr. Barron\nmentioned at one time that he hoped to visit our settlement here\nwhile he was in North Africa.",
    "That may possibly have given rise to a\nmisconception.",
    "So you tell me said Jessop that I am mistaken That these\npeople are none of them here.",
    "But how can they be my dear sir since they were all killed in this\nplane accident The bodies were recovered I believe.",
    "The bodies recovered were too badly charred for identification.",
    "Jessop spoke the last words with deliberation and significance.",
    "There was a little stir behind him.",
    "A thin precise very attenuated\nvoice said\n\nDo I understand you to say that there was no precise\nidentification Lord Alverstoke was leaning forward his hand to\nhis ear.",
    "Under bushy overhanging eyebrows his small keen eyes\nlooked into Jessops.",
    "There could be no formal identification my lord said Jessop\nand I have reason to believe these people survived that accident.",
    "Believe said Lord Alverstoke with displeasure in his thin high\nvoice.",
    "I should have said I had evidence of survival.",
    "Evidence Of what nature Mr.  er  er  Jessop.",
    "Mrs. Betterton was wearing a choker of false pearls on the day she\nleft Fez for Marrakesh said Jessop.",
    "One of these pearls was\nfound at a distance of half a mile from the burnt out plane.",
    "How can you state positively that the pearl found actually came\nfrom Mrs. Bettertons necklace\n\nBecause all the pearls of that necklace had had a mark put upon\nthem invisible to the naked eye but recognisable under a strong\nlens.",
    "Who put that mark on them\n\nI did Lord Alverstoke in the presence of my colleague here\nMonsieur Leblanc.",
    "You put those marks  you had a reason in marking those pearls in\nthat special fashion\n\n\fYes my lord.",
    "I had reason to believe that Mrs. Betterton would\nlead me to her husband Thomas Betterton against whom a\nwarrant is out.",
    "Jessop continued.",
    "Two more of these pearls came\nto light.",
    "Each on stages of a route between where the plane was\nburnt out and the settlement where we now are.",
    "Enquiries in the\nplaces where these pearls were found resulted in a description of\nsix people roughly approximating to those people who were\nsupposed to have been burnt in the plane.",
    "One of these passengers\nhad also been supplied with a glove impregnated with luminous\nphosphorous paint.",
    "That mark was found on a car which had\ntransported these passengers part of the way here.",
    "Lord Alverstoke remarked in his dry judicial voice\n\nVery remarkable.",
    "In the big chair Mr. Aristides stirred.",
    "His eyelids blinked once or\ntwice rapidly.",
    "Then he asked a question.",
    "Where were the last traces of this party of people found\n\nAt a disused airfield Sir.",
    "He gave precise location.",
    "That is many hundreds of miles from here said Mr. Aristides.",
    "Granted that your very interesting speculations are correct that\nfor some reason the accident was faked these passengers I\ngather then took off from this disused airport for some unknown\ndestination.",
    "Since that airport is many hundreds of miles from here\nI really cannot see on what you base your belief that these people\nare here.",
    "Why should they be\n\n\fThere are certain very good reasons sir.",
    "A signal was picked up\nby one of our searching airplanes.",
    "The signal was brought to\nMonsieur\n\nLeblanc\n\nhere.",
    "Commencing with\n\na special\n\ncode\n\nrecognition signal it gave the information that the people in\nquestion were at a Leper Settlement.",
    "I find this remarkable said Mr. Aristides.",
    "Very remarkable.",
    "But it\nseems to me that there is no doubt that an attempt has been made\nto mislead you.",
    "These people are not here.",
    "He spoke with a quiet\ndefinite decision.",
    "You are at perfect liberty to search the\nsettlement if you like.",
    "I doubt if we should find anything sir said Jessop not that is\nby a superficial search although he added deliberately I am\naware of the area at which the search should begin.",
    "Indeed And where is that\n\nIn the fourth corridor from the second laboratory turning to the left\nat the end of the passage there.",
    "There was an abrupt movement from Dr. Van Heidem.",
    "Two glasses\ncrashed from the tables to the floor.",
    "Jessop looked at him smiling.",
    "You see Doctor he said we are well informed.",
    "Van\n\nHeidem\n\nsaid\n\nsharply\n\nIts\n\npreposterous.",
    "Absolutely\n\npreposterous You are suggesting that we are detaining people\nhere against their will.",
    "I deny that categorically.",
    "The Minister said uncomfortably\n\nWe seem to have arrived at an impasse.",
    "Mr. Aristides said gently\n\nIt has been an interesting theory.",
    "But it is only a theory.",
    "He\nglanced at his watch.",
    "You will excuse me gentlemen if I suggest\nthat you should leave now.",
    "You have a long drive back to the\nairport and there will be alarm felt if your plane is overdue.",
    "Both Leblanc and Jessop realised that it had come now to the\nshowdown.",
    "Aristides was exerting all the force of his considerable\npersonality.",
    "He was daring these men to oppose his will.",
    "If they\npersisted it meant that they were willing to come out into the open\nagainst him.",
    "The Minister as per his instructions was anxious to\ncapitulate.",
    "The Chief of Police was anxious only to be agreeable to\nthe Minister.",
    "The American Ambassador was not satisfied but he\ntoo would hesitate for diplomatic reasons to insist.",
    "The British\nConsul would have to fall in with the other two.",
    "The journalists  Aristides considered the journalists  the\njournalists could be attended to Their price might come high but he\nwas of the opinion that they could be bought.",
    "And if they could not\nbe bought  well there were other ways.",
    "As for Jessop and Leblanc they knew.",
    "That was clear but they\ncould not act without authority.",
    "His eyes went on and met the eyes\nof a man as old as himself cold legal eyes.",
    "This man he knew\ncould not be bought.",
    "But after all... His thoughts were interrupted\nby the sound of that cold clear far away little voice.",
    "I am of the opinion said the voice that we should not unduly\nhurry our departure.",
    "For there is a case here that it seems to me\nwould bear further enquiry.",
    "Grave allegations have been made and\nshould not I consider be allowed to drop.",
    "In fairness every\nopportunity should be given to rebut them.",
    "The onus of proof said Mr. Aristides is on you.",
    "He made a\ngraceful\n\ngesture\n\ntowards\n\nthe\n\ncompany.",
    "A\n\npreposterous\n\naccusation has been made unsupported by any evidence.",
    "Not unsupported.",
    "Dr. Van Heidem swung round in surprise.",
    "One of the Moroccan\nservants had stepped forward.",
    "He was a fine figure of a man in\nwhite embroidered robes with a white turban surrounding his head\nhis face gleamed black and oily.",
    "What caused the entire company to gaze at him in speechless\nastonishment was the fact that from his full rather Negroid lips a\nvoice of purely transAtlantic origin was proceeding.",
    "Not unsupported that voice said you can take my evidence here\nand now.",
    "These gentlemen have denied that Andrew Peters Torquil\nEricsson Mr. and Mrs. Betterton and Dr. Louis Barron are here.",
    "Thats false.",
    "Theyre all here  and I speak for them.",
    "He took a step\nforward towards the American Ambassador.",
    "You may find me a bit\ndifficult to recognise at the moment.",
    "Sir he said but I am Andrew\nPeters.",
    "A very faint sibilant hiss issued from Aristides lips then he settled\nback in his chair his face impassive once more.",
    "Theres a whole crowd of people hidden away here said Peters.",
    "Theres Schwartz of Munich theres Helga Needheim there are\nJeffreys and Davidson the English scientists theres Paul Wade\nfrom the U.S.A. there are the Italians Ricochetti and Bianco\ntheres Murchison.",
    "Theyre all right here in this building.",
    "Theres a\nsystem of closing bulkheads thats quite impossible to detect by the\nnaked eye.",
    "Theres a whole network of secret laboratories cut right\ndown into the rock.",
    "God bless my soul ejaculated the American Ambassador.",
    "He\nlooked searchingly at the dignified African figure and then he\nbegan to laugh.",
    "I wouldnt say Id recognise you even now he\nsaid.",
    "Thats the injection of paraffin in the lips sir to say nothing of\nblack pigment.",
    "If youre Peters whats the number you go under in the F.B.I.",
    "813471 sir.",
    "Right said the Ambassador and the initials of your other\nname\n\nB.A.B.D.G.",
    "sir.",
    "The Ambassador nodded.",
    "This man is Peters he said.",
    "He looked towards the Minister.",
    "The Minister hesitated then cleared his throat.",
    "You claim he demanded of Peters that people are being\ndetained here against their will\n\nSome are here willingly Excellence and some are not.",
    "In that case said the Minister statements must be taken  er yes yes statements must certainly be taken.",
    "He looked at the Prefect of Police.",
    "The latter stepped forward.",
    "Just a moment please.",
    "Mr. Aristides raised a hand.",
    "It would\nseem he said in a gentle precise voice that my confidence here\nhas been greatly abused.",
    "His cold glance went from Van Heidem\nto the Director and there was implacable command in it.",
    "As to\nwhat you have permitted yourselves to do gentlemen in your\nenthusiasm for science I am not as yet quite clear.",
    "My endowment\nof this place was purely in the interests of research.",
    "I have taken no\npart in the practical application of its policy.",
    "I would advise you\nMonsieur le Directeur if this accusation is borne out by facts to\n\n\fproduce immediately those people who are suspected of being\ndetained here unlawfully.",
    "But Monsieur it is impossible.",
    "I  it will be \n\nAny experiment of that kind said Mr. Aristides is at an end.",
    "His\ncalm financiers gaze swept over his guests.",
    "I need hardly assure\nyou Messieurs he said that if anything illegal is going on here it\nhas been no concern of mine.",
    "It was an order and understood as such because of his wealth\nbecause of his power and because of his influence.",
    "Mr. Aristides\nthat worldfamous figure would not be implicated in this affair.",
    "Yet\neven though he himself escaped unscathed it was nevertheless\ndefeat.",
    "Defeat for his purpose defeat for that brains pool from\nwhich he had hoped to profit so greatly.",
    "Mr. Aristides was\nunperturbed by failure.",
    "It had happened to him occasionally in the\ncourse of his career.",
    "He had always accepted it philosophically and\ngone on to the next coup.",
    "He made an oriental gesture of his hand.",
    "I wash my hands of this affair he said.",
    "The Prefect of Police bustled forward.",
    "He had had his cue now he\nknew what his instructions were and he was prepared to go ahead\nwith the full force of his official position.",
    "I want no obstructions he said.",
    "It is my duty.",
    "His face very pale Van Heidem stepped forward.",
    "If you will come this way he said I will show you our reserve\naccommodation.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nOh I feel as if Id woken up out of a nightmare sighed Hilary.",
    "She stretched her arms wide above her head.",
    "They were sitting on\nthe terrace of the hotel in Tangier.",
    "They had arrived there that\nmorning by plane.",
    "Hilary went on\n\nDid it all happen It cant have\n\nIt happened all right said Tom Betterton but I agree with you\nOlive it was a nightmare.",
    "Ah well Im out of it now.",
    "Jessop came along the terrace and sat down beside them.",
    "Wheres Andy Peters asked Hilary.",
    "Hell be here presently said Jessop.",
    "He has a bit of business to\nattend to.",
    "So Peters was one of your people said Hilary and he did things\nwith phosphorous and a lead cigarette case that squirted radioactive material.",
    "I never knew a thing about that.",
    "No said Jessop you were both very discreet with each other.",
    "Strictly speaking though he isnt one of my people.",
    "He represents\nthe U.S.A.\n\nThats what you meant by saying that if I actually reached Tom\nhere you hoped I should have protection You meant Andy Peters.",
    "Jessop nodded.",
    "I hope youre not blaming me said Jessop in his most owllike\nmanner for not providing you with the desired end of your\nexperience.",
    "Hilary looked puzzled.",
    "What end\n\nA more sporting form of suicide he said.",
    "Oh that She shook her head incredulously.",
    "That seems just as\nunreal as anything else.",
    "Ive been Olive Betterton so long now that\nIm feeling quite confused to be Hilary Craven again.",
    "Ah said Jessop there is my friend Leblanc.",
    "I must go and speak\nto him.",
    "He left them and walked along the terrace.",
    "Tom Betterton said\nquickly\n\nDo one more thing for me will you Olive I call you Olive still  Ive\ngot used to it.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "What is it\n\nWalk along the terrace with me then come back here and say that\nIve gone up to my room to lie down.",
    "She looked at him questioningly.",
    "Why What are you \n\nIm off my dear while the goings good.",
    "Off where\n\nAnywhere.",
    "But why\n\nUse your head my dear girl.",
    "I dont know what the status is here.",
    "Tangier is an odd sort of place not under the jurisdiction of any\nparticular country.",
    "But I know whatll happen if I come with the rest\nof you to Gibraltar.",
    "The first thing thatll happen when I get there I\nshall be arrested.",
    "Hilary looked at him with concern.",
    "In the excitement of their escape\nfrom the Unit she had forgotten Tom Bettertons troubles.",
    "You mean the Official Secrets Act or whatever they call it But\nyou cant really hope to get away can you Tom Where can you\ngo\n\n\fIve told you.",
    "Anywhere.",
    "But is that feasible nowadays Theres money and all sorts of\ndifficulties.",
    "He gave a short laugh.",
    "The moneys all right.",
    "Its salted away where I can get at it under a\nnew name.",
    "So you did take money\n\nOf course I took money.",
    "But theyll track you down.",
    "Theyll find it hard to do that.",
    "Dont you realise Olive that the\ndescription theyll have of me is quite unlike my present\nappearance.",
    "Thats why I was so keen on this plastic surgery\nbusiness.",
    "Thats been the whole point you see.",
    "To get away from\nEngland bank some money have my appearance altered in such a\nway that Im safe for life.",
    "Hilary looked at him doubtfully.",
    "Youre wrong she said.",
    "Im sure youre wrong.",
    "Itd be far better\nto go back and face the music.",
    "After all its not war time.",
    "Youd only\nget a short term of imprisonment I expect.",
    "Whats the good of being\nhounded for the rest of your life\n\n\fYou dont understand he said.",
    "You dont understand the first\nthing about it all.",
    "Come on lets get going.",
    "Theres no time to lose.",
    "But how are you going to get away from Tangier\n\nIll manage.",
    "Dont you worry.",
    "She got up from her seat and walked with him slowly along the\nterrace.",
    "She felt curiously inadequate and tonguetied.",
    "She had\nfulfilled her obligations to Jessop and also to the dead woman\nOlive Betterton.",
    "Now there was no more to do.",
    "She and Tom\nBetterton had shared weeks of the closest association and yet she\nfelt they were still strangers to each other.",
    "No bond of fellowship or\nfriendship had grown up between them.",
    "They reached the end of the terrace.",
    "There was a small side door\nthere through the wall which led out on to a narrow road which\ncurved down the hill to the port.",
    "I shall slip out this way Betterton said nobodys watching.",
    "So\nlong.",
    "Good luck to you said Hilary slowly.",
    "She stood there watching Betterton as he went to the door and\nturned its handle.",
    "As the door opened he stepped back a pace and\nstopped.",
    "Three men stood in the doorway.",
    "Two of them entered and\ncame towards him.",
    "The first spoke formally.",
    "Thomas Betterton I have here a warrant for your arrest.",
    "You will\nbe held here in custody whilst extradition proceedings are taken.",
    "Betterton turned sharply but the other man had moved quickly\nround the other side of him.",
    "Instead he turned back with a laugh.",
    "Its quite all right he said except that Im not Thomas\nBetterton.",
    "The third man moved in through the doorway came to stand by the\nside of the other two.",
    "Oh yes you are he said.",
    "Youre Thomas Betterton.",
    "Betterton laughed.",
    "What you mean is that for the last month youve been living with me\nand hearing me called Thomas Betterton and hearing me call\nmyself Thomas Betterton.",
    "The point is that Im not Thomas\nBetterton.",
    "I met Betterton in Paris I came on and took his place.",
    "Ask this lady if you dont believe me he said.",
    "She came to join me\npretending to be my wife and I recognised her as my wife.",
    "I did\ndidnt I\n\nHilary nodded her head.",
    "That said Betterton was because not being Thomas Betterton\nnaturally I didnt know Thomas Bettertons wife from Adam.",
    "I\nthought she was Thomas Bettertons wife.",
    "Afterwards I had to think\n\n\fup some sort of explanation that would satisfy her.",
    "But thats the\ntruth.",
    "So thats why you pretended to know me cried Hilary.",
    "When you\ntold me to play up  to keep up the deception\n\nBetterton laughed again confidently.",
    "Im not Betterton he said.",
    "Look at any photograph of Betterton\nand youll see Im speaking the truth.",
    "Peters stepped forward.",
    "His voice when he spoke was totally unlike\nthe voice of the Peters that Hilary had known so well.",
    "It was quiet\nand implacable.",
    "Ive seen photographs of Betterton he said and I agree I\nwouldnt have recognised you as the man.",
    "But you are Thomas\nBetterton all the same and Ill prove it.",
    "He seized Betterton with a sudden strong grasp and tore off his\njacket.",
    "If youre Thomas Betterton he said youve got a scar in the\nshape of a Z in the crook of your right elbow.",
    "As he spoke he ripped up the shirt and bent back Bettertons arm.",
    "There you are he said pointing triumphantly.",
    "There are two lab\nassistants in the U.S.A. wholl testify to that.",
    "I know about it\nbecause Elsa wrote and told me when you did it.",
    "Elsa Betterton stared at him.",
    "He began to shake nervously.",
    "Elsa What about Elsa\n\nAsk what the charge is against you\n\nThe police official stepped forward once more.",
    "The charge he said is murder in the first degree.",
    "Murder of your\nwife Elsa Betterton.",
    "Chapter 22\n\nIm sorry Olive.",
    "Youve got to believe Im sorry.",
    "About you I mean.",
    "For your sake Id have given him one chance.",
    "I warned you that hed\nbe safer to stay in the Unit and yet Id come half way across the\nworld to get him and I meant to get him for what he did to Elsa.",
    "I dont understand.",
    "I dont understand anything.",
    "Who are you\n\nI thought you knew that.",
    "Im Boris Andrei Pavlov Glydr Elsas\ncousin.",
    "I was sent over to America from Poland to the University\nthere to complete my education.",
    "And the way things were in Europe\nmy uncle thought it best for me to take out American citizenship.",
    "I\ntook the name of Andrew Peters.",
    "Then when the war came I went\nback to Europe.",
    "I worked for the Resistance.",
    "I got my uncle and\nElsa out of Poland and they got to America.",
    "Elsa  Ive told you\nabout Elsa already.",
    "She was one of the firstclass scientists of our\n\n\ftime.",
    "It was Elsa who discovered ZE fission.",
    "Betterton was a young\nCanadian who was attached to Mannheim to help him in his\nexperiments.",
    "He knew his job but there was no more to him than\nthat.",
    "He deliberately made love to Elsa and married her so as to be\nassociated with her in the scientific work she was doing.",
    "When her\nexperiments neared completion and he realised what a big thing ZE\nfission was going to be he deliberately poisoned her.",
    "Oh no no.",
    "Yes.",
    "There were no suspicions at the time.",
    "Betterton appeared\nheartbroken threw himself with renewed ardour into his work and\nthen announced the ZE fission discovery as his own.",
    "It brought him\nwhat he wanted.",
    "Fame and the recognition of being a firstclass\nscientist.",
    "He thought it prudent after that to leave America and\ncome to England.",
    "He went to Harwell and worked there.",
    "I was tied up in Europe for some time after the war ended.",
    "Since I\nhad a good knowledge of German Russian and Polish I could do\nvery useful work there.",
    "The letter that Elsa had written to me before\nshe died disquieted me.",
    "The illness from which she was suffering\nand from which she died seemed to me mysterious and\nunaccounted for.",
    "When at last I got back to the U.S.A.",
    "I started\ninstituting enquiries.",
    "We wont go into it all but I found what I was\nlooking for.",
    "Enough that is to apply for an Order of Exhumation of\nthe body.",
    "There was a young fellow in the District Attorneys office\nwho had been a great friend of Betterton.",
    "He was going over on a\ntrip to Europe about that time and I think that he visited Betterton\nand in the course of his visit mentioned the exhumation.",
    "Betterton\ngot the wind up.",
    "I imagine that hed been already approached by\n\n\fagents of our friend Mr. Aristides.",
    "Anyway he now saw that there\nlay his best chance to avoid being arrested and tried for murder.",
    "He accepted the terms stipulating that his facial appearance was\nto be completely changed.",
    "What actually happened of course was\nthat he found himself in a very real captivity.",
    "Moreover he found\nhimself in a dangerous position there since he was quite unable to\ndeliver the goods  the scientific goods that is to say.",
    "He was not\nand never had been a man of genius.",
    "And you followed him\n\nYes.",
    "When\n\nthe newspapers\n\nwere\n\nfull of\n\nthe\n\nsensational\n\ndisappearance of the scientist Thomas Betterton I came over to\nEngland.",
    "A rather brilliant scientist friend of mine had had certain\novertures made to him by a woman a Mrs. Speeder who worked\nfor UNO.",
    "I discovered on arriving in England that she had had a\nmeeting with Betterton.",
    "I played up to her expressing Left Wing\nviews rather exaggerating perhaps my scientific abilities.",
    "I\nthought you see that Betterton had gone behind the Iron Curtain\nwhere no one could reach him.",
    "Well if nobody else could reach\nhim I was going to reach him.",
    "His lips set in a grim line.",
    "Elsa was\na firstclass scientist and she was a beautiful and gentle woman.",
    "Shed been killed and robbed by the man whom she loved and\ntrusted.",
    "If necessary I was going to kill Betterton with my own\nhands.",
    "I see said Hilary oh I see now.",
    "I wrote to you said Peters when I got to England.",
    "Wrote to you\nthat is in my Polish name telling you the facts.",
    "He looked at her.",
    "I\nsuppose you didnt believe me.",
    "You never answered.",
    "He shrugged\nhis shoulders.",
    "Then I went to the Intelligence people.",
    "At first I went\nthere putting on an act.",
    "Polish officer.",
    "Stiff foreign and correctly\nformal.",
    "I was suspicious just then of everybody.",
    "However in the\nend Jessop and I got together.",
    "He paused.",
    "This morning my quest\nhas come to an end.",
    "Extradition will be applied for Betterton will go\nto the U.S.A. and will stand his trial there.",
    "If hes acquitted I have\nno more to say.",
    "He added grimly But he wont be acquitted.",
    "The\nevidence is too strong.",
    "He paused staring down over the sunlit gardens towards the sea.",
    "The hell of it is he said that you came out there to join him and I\nmet you and fell in love with you.",
    "It has been hell Olive.",
    "Believe me.",
    "So there we are.",
    "Im the man whos responsible for sending your\nhusband to the electric chair.",
    "We cant get away from it.",
    "Its a thing\nthat youll never be able to forget even if you forgave it.",
    "He got up.",
    "Well I wanted to tell you the whole story from my own lips.",
    "This is\ngoodbye.",
    "He turned abruptly as Hilary stretched out a hand.",
    "Wait she said wait.",
    "There is something you dont know.",
    "Im not\nBettertons wife.",
    "Bettertons\n\nwife Olive\n\nBetterton died at\n\nCasablanca.",
    "Jessop persuaded me to take her place.",
    "He wheeled round staring at her.",
    "Youre not Olive Betterton\n\n\fNo.",
    "Good Lord said Andy Peters.",
    "Good Lord He dropped heavily\ninto a chair beside her.",
    "Olive he said Olive my darling.",
    "Dont call me Olive.",
    "My names Hilary.",
    "Hilary Craven.",
    "Hilary He said it questioningly.",
    "Ill have to get used to that.",
    "He\nput his hand over hers.",
    "At the other end of the terrace Jessop discussing with Leblanc\nvarious technical difficulties in the present situation broke off in\nthe middle of a sentence.",
    "You were saying he asked absently.",
    "I said mon cher that it does not seem to me that we are going to\nbe able to proceed against this animal of Aristides.",
    "No no.",
    "Aristides always wins.",
    "That is to say he always manages to\nsquirm out from under.",
    "But hell have lost a lot of money and he\nwont like that.",
    "And even Aristides cant keep death at bay for ever.",
    "I should say hell be coming up before the Supreme Justice before\nvery long from the look of him.",
    "What was it attracting your attention my friend\n\nThose two said Jessop.",
    "I sent Hilary Craven off on a journey to a\ndestination unknown but it seems to me that her journeys end is\nthe usual one after all.",
    "Leblanc looked puzzled for a moment then he said\n\nAha Yes Your Shakespeare\n\nYou Frenchmen are so well read said Jessop."
