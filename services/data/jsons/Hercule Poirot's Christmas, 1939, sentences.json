    "Hercule Poirot\u2019s Christmas\nAgatha Christie\n1938\n\n\fMy dear James\nYou have always been one of the most faithful and kindly of my readers and I was\ntherefore seriously perturbed when I received from you a word of criticism.",
    "You complained that my murders were getting too refined\u2014anaemic in fact.",
    "You\nyearned for a \u2018good violent murder with lots of blood\u2019.",
    "A murder where there was\nno doubt about its being murder\nSo this is your special story\u2014written for you.",
    "I hope it may please.",
    "Your affectionate sister\u2010in\u2010law\nAgatha\n\n\fYet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him\n\u2010Macbeth\n\n4\n\n\fPart 1\nDecember 22nd\nStephen pulled up the collar of his coat as he walked briskly along the platform.",
    "Overhead a dim fog clouded the station.",
    "Large engines hissed superbly throwing off\nclouds of steam into the cold raw air.",
    "Everything was dirty and smoke\u2010grimed.",
    "Stephen thought with revulsion \u2018What a foul country\u2014what a foul city\u2019\nHis first excited reaction to London its shops its restaurants its well\u2010dressed attractive\nwomen had faded.",
    "He saw it now as a glittering rhinestone set in a dingy setting.",
    "Supposing he were back in South Africa now...",
    "He felt a quick pang of homesickness.",
    "Sunshine\u2014blue skies\u2014gardens of flowers\u2014cool blue flowers\u2014hedges of plumbago\u2014blue\nconvolvulus clinging to every little shanty.",
    "And here\u2014dirt grime and endless incessant crowds\u2014moving hurrying\u2014jostling.",
    "Busy\nants running industriously about their ant\u2010hill.",
    "For a moment he thought \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t come...\u2019\nThen he remembered his purpose and his lips set back in a grim line.",
    "No by hell he\u2019d go on with it He\u2019d planned this for years.",
    "He\u2019d always meant to do\u2014\nwhat he was going to do.",
    "Yes he\u2019d go on with it\nThat momentary reluctance that sudden questioning of himself \u2018Why Is it worth it Why\ndwell on the past Why not wipe out the whole thing\u2019\u2014all that was only weakness.",
    "He\nwas not a boy\u2014to be turned his this way and that by the whim of the moment.",
    "He was a\nman of forty assured purposeful.",
    "He would go on with it.",
    "He would do what he had come\nto England to do.",
    "He got on the train and passed along the corridor looking for a place.",
    "He had waved aside\na porter and was carrying his own raw\u2010hide suitcase.",
    "He looked into carriage after\ncarriage.",
    "The train was full.",
    "It was only three days before Christmas.",
    "Stephen Farr looked\ndistastefully at the crowded carriages.",
    "People Incessant innumerable people And all so\u2014so\u2014what was the word\u2014so drab\u2010\nlooking So alike so horribly alike Those that hadn\u2019t got faces like sheep had faces like\nrabbits he thought.",
    "Some of them chattered and fussed.",
    "Some heavily middle\u2010aged men\ngrunted.",
    "More like pigs those.",
    "Even the girls slender egg\u2010faced scarlet\u2010lipped were of a\ndepressing uniformity.",
    "He thought with a sudden longing of open veldt sun\u2010baked and lonely...\n\n5\n\n\fAnd then suddenly he caught his breath looking into a carriage.",
    "This girl was different.",
    "Black hair rich creamy pallor\u2014eyes with the depth and darkness of night in them.",
    "The sad\nproud eyes of the South...",
    "It was all wrong that this girl should be sitting in this train\namong these dull drab\u2010looking people\u2014all wrong that she should be going into the dreary\nmidlands of England.",
    "She should have been on a balcony a rose between her lips a piece\nof black lace draping her proud head and there should have been dust and heat and the\nsmell of blood\u2014the smell of the bull\u2010ring\u2014in the air... She should be somewhere splendid\nnot squeezed into the corner of a third\u2010class carriage.",
    "He was an observant man.",
    "He did not fail to note the shabbiness of her little black coat\nand skirt the cheap quality of her fabric gloves the flimsy shoes and the defiant note of a\nflame\u2010red handbag.",
    "Nevertheless splendour was the quality he associated with her.",
    "She\nwas splendid fine exotic...\nWhat the hell was she doing in this country of fogs and chills and hurrying industrious\nants\nHe thought \u2018I\u2019ve got to know who she is and what she\u2019s doing here... I\u2019ve got to know...\u2019\nII\nPilar sat squeezed up against the window and thought how very odd the English smelt...",
    "It\nwas what had struck her so far most forcibly about England\u2014the difference of smell.",
    "There was no garlic and no dust and very little perfume.",
    "In this carriage now there was a\nsmell of cold stuffiness\u2014the sulphur smell of the trains\u2014the smell of soap and another\nvery unpleasant smell\u2014it came she thought from the fur collar of the stout woman\nsitting beside her.",
    "Pilar sniffed delicately imbibing the odour of mothballs reluctantly.",
    "It\nwas a funny scent to choose to put on yourself she thought.",
    "A whistle blew a stentorian voice cried out something and the train jerked slowly out of\nthe station.",
    "They had started.",
    "She was on her way...",
    "Her heart beat a little faster.",
    "Would it be all right Would she be able to accomplish what\nshe had set out to do Surely\u2014surely\u2014she had thought it all out so carefully... She was\nprepared for every eventuality.",
    "Oh yes she would succeed\u2014she must succeed...",
    "The curve of Pilar\u2019s red mouth curved upwards.",
    "It was suddenly cruel that mouth.",
    "Cruel\nand greedy\u2014like the mouth of a child or a kitten\u2014a mouth that knew only its own desires\nand that was as yet unaware of pity.",
    "She looked round her with the frank curiosity of a child.",
    "All these people seven of them\u2014\nhow funny they were the English They all seemed so rich so prosperous\u2014their clothes\u2014\ntheir boots\u2014Oh undoubtedly England was a very rich country as she had always heard.",
    "But they were not at all gay\u2014no decidedly not gay.",
    "That was a handsome man standing in the corridor... Pilar thought he was very handsome.",
    "She liked his deeply bronzed face and his high\u2010bridged nose and his square shoulders.",
    "More quickly than any English girl Pilar had seen that the man admired her.",
    "She had not\n6\n\n\flooked at him once directly but she knew perfectly how often he had looked at her and\nexactly how he had looked.",
    "She registered the facts without much interest or emotion.",
    "She came from a country\nwhere men looked at women as a matter of course and did not disguise the fact unduly.",
    "She wondered if he was an Englishman and decided that he was not.",
    "\u2018He is too alive too real to be English\u2019 Pilar decided.",
    "\u2018And yet he is fair.",
    "He may be\nperhaps Americano.\u2019 He was she thought rather like the actors she had seen in Wild West\nfilms.",
    "An attendant pushed his way along the corridor.",
    "\u2018First lunch please.",
    "First lunch.",
    "Take your seats for first lunch.\u2019\nThe seven occupants of Pilar\u2019s carriage all held tickets for the first lunch.",
    "They rose in a\nbody and the carriage was suddenly deserted and peaceful.",
    "Pilar quickly pulled up the window which had been let down a couple of inches at the top\nby a militant\u2010looking grey\u2010haired lady in the opposite corner.",
    "Then she sprawled\ncomfortably back on her seat and peered out of the window at the northern suburbs of\nLondon.",
    "She did not turn her head at the sound of the door sliding back.",
    "It was the man\nfrom the corridor and Pilar knew of course that he had entered the carriage on purpose\nto talk to her.",
    "She continued to look pensively out of the window.",
    "Stephen Farr said \u2018Would you like the window down at all\u2019\nPilar replied demurely \u2018On the contrary.",
    "I have just shut it.\u2019\nShe spoke English perfectly but with a slight accent.",
    "During the pause that ensued Stephen thought \u2018A delicious voice.",
    "It has the sun in it...",
    "It\nis warm like a summer night...\u2019\nPilar thought \u2018I like his voice.",
    "It is big and strong.",
    "He is attractive\u2014yes he is attractive.\u2019\nStephen said \u2018The train is very full.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes indeed.",
    "The people go away from London I suppose because it is so black there.\u2019\nPilar had not been brought up to believe that it was a crime to talk to strange men in\ntrains.",
    "She could take care of herself as well as any girl but she had no rigid taboos.",
    "If Stephen had been brought up in England he might have felt ill at ease at entering into\nconversation with a young girl.",
    "But Stephen was a friendly soul who found it perfectly\nnatural to talk to anyone if he felt like it.",
    "7\n\n\fHe smiled without any self\u2010consciousness and said \u2018London\u2019s rather a terrible place isn\u2019t\nit\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes.",
    "I do not like it at all.\u2019\n\u2018No more do I.\u2019\nPilar said \u2018You are not English no\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m British but I come from South Africa.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I see that explains it.\u2019\n\u2018Have you just come from abroad\u2019\nPilar nodded.",
    "\u2018I come from Spain.\u2019\nStephen was interested.",
    "\u2018From Spain do you You\u2019re Spanish then\u2019\n\u2018I am half Spanish.",
    "My mother was English.",
    "That is why I talk English so well.\u2019\n\u2018What about this war business\u2019 asked Stephen.",
    "\u2018It is very terrible yes\u2014very sad.",
    "There has been damage done quite a lot\u2014yes.\u2019\n\u2018Which side are you on\u2019\nPilar\u2019s politics seemed to be rather vague.",
    "In the village where she came from she\nexplained nobody had paid very much attention to the war.",
    "\u2018It has not been near us you\nunderstand.",
    "The Mayor he is of course an officer of the Government so he is for the\nGovernment and the priest is for General Franco\u2014but most of the people are busy with\nthe vines and the land they have not time to go into these questions.\u2019\n\u2018So there wasn\u2019t any fighting round you\u2019\nPilar said that there had not been.",
    "\u2018But then I drove in a car\u2019 she explained \u2018all across the\ncountry and there was much destruction.",
    "And I saw a bomb drop and it blew up a car\u2014\nyes and another destroyed a house.",
    "It was very exciting\u2019\nStephen Farr smiled a faintly twisted smile.",
    "\u2018So that\u2019s how it seemed to you\u2019\n\u2018It was a nuisance too\u2019 explained Pilar.",
    "\u2018Because I wanted to get on and the driver of my\ncar he was killed.\u2019\n8\n\n\fStephen said watching her \u2018That didn\u2019t upset you\u2019\nPilar\u2019s great dark eyes opened very wide.",
    "\u2018Everyone must die That is so is it not If it comes quickly from the sky\u2014bouff\u2014like that\nit is as well as any other way.",
    "One is alive for a time\u2014yes and then one is dead.",
    "That is\nwhat happens in this world.\u2019\nStephen Farr laughed.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think you are a pacifist.\u2019\n\u2018You do not think I am what\u2019 Pilar seemed puzzled by a word which had not previously\nentered her vocabulary.",
    "\u2018Do you forgive your enemies se\u00f1orita\u2019\nPilar shook her head.",
    "\u2018I have no enemies.",
    "But if I had\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019\nHe was watching her fascinated anew by the sweet cruel upward\u2010curving mouth.",
    "Pilar said gravely \u2018If I had an enemy\u2014if anyone hated me and I hated them\u2014then I would\ncut my enemy\u2019s throat like this...\u2019\nShe made a graphic gesture.",
    "It was so swift and so crude that Stephen Farr was momentarily taken aback.",
    "He said \u2018You\nare a bloodthirsty young woman\u2019\nPilar asked in a matter\u2010of\u2010fact tone \u2018What would you do to your enemy\u2019\nHe started\u2014stared at her then laughed aloud.",
    "\u2018I wonder\u2014\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I wonder\u2019\nPilar said disapprovingly \u2018But surely\u2014you know.\u2019\nHe checked his laughter drew in his breath and said in a low voice \u2018Yes.",
    "I know...\u2019\nThen with a rapid change of manner he asked \u2018What made you come to England\u2019\nPilar replied with a certain demureness.",
    "\u2018I am going to stay with my relations\u2014with my English relations.\u2019\n9\n\n\f\u2018I see.\u2019\nHe leaned back in his seat studying her\u2014wondering what these English relations of whom\nshe spoke were like\u2014wondering what they would make of this Spanish stranger... trying\nto picture her in the midst of some sober British family at Christmas time.",
    "Pilar asked \u2018Is it nice South Africa yes\u2019\nHe began to talk to her about South Africa.",
    "She listened with the pleased attention of a\nchild hearing a story.",
    "He enjoyed her na\u00efve but shrewd questions and amused himself by\nmaking a kind of exaggerated fairy story of it all.",
    "The return of the proper occupants of the carriage put an end to this diversion.",
    "He rose\nsmiled into her eyes and made his way out again into the corridor.",
    "As he stood back for a minute in the doorway to allow an elderly lady to come in his eyes\nfell on the label of Pilar\u2019s obviously foreign straw case.",
    "He read the name with interest\u2014\nMiss Pilar Estravados\u2014then as his eye caught the address it widened to incredulity and\nsome other feeling\u2014Gorston Hall Longdale Addlesfield.",
    "He half turned staring at the girl with a new expression\u2014puzzled resentful suspicious...",
    "He went out into the corridor and stood there smoking a cigarette and frowning to\nhimself...\nIII\nIn the big blue and gold drawing\u2010room at Gorston Hall Alfred Lee and Lydia his wife sat\ndiscussing their plans for Christmas.",
    "Alfred was a squarely built man of middle age with a\ngentle face and mild brown eyes.",
    "His voice when he spoke was quiet and precise with a\nvery clear enunciation.",
    "His head was sunk into his shoulders and he gave a curious\nimpression of inertia.",
    "Lydia his wife was an energetic lean greyhound of a woman.",
    "She\nwas amazingly thin but all her movements had a swift startled grace about them.",
    "There was no beauty in her careless haggard face but it had distinction.",
    "Her voice was\ncharming.",
    "Alfred said \u2018Father insists There\u2019s nothing else to it.\u2019\nLydia controlled a sudden impatient movement.",
    "She said \u2018Must you always give in to\nhim\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s a very old man my dear\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Oh I know\u2014I know\u2019\n\u2018He expects to have his own way.\u2019\n\n10\n\n\fLydia said dryly \u2018Naturally since he has always had it But some time or other Alfred you\nwill have to make a stand.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean Lydia\u2019\nHe stared at her so palpably upset and startled that for a moment she bit her lip and\nseemed doubtful whether to go on.",
    "Alfred Lee repeated \u2018What do you mean Lydia\u2019\nShe shrugged her thin graceful shoulders.",
    "She said trying to choose her words cautiously \u2018Your father is\u2014inclined to be\u2014\ntyrannical\u2014\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s old.\u2019\n\u2018And will grow older.",
    "And consequently more tyrannical.",
    "Where will it end Already he\ndictates our lives to us completely.",
    "We can\u2019t make a plan of our own If we do it is always\nliable to be upset.\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018Father expects to come first.",
    "He is very good to us remember.\u2019\n\u2018Oh good to us\u2019\n\u2018Very good to us.\u2019\nAlfred spoke with a trace of sternness.",
    "\u2018Lydia said calmly \u2018You mean financially\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "His own wants are very simple.",
    "But he never grudges us money.",
    "You can spend what\nyou like on dress and on this house and the bills are paid without a murmur.",
    "He gave us a\nnew car only last week.\u2019\n\u2018As far as money goes your father is very generous I admit\u2019 said Lydia.",
    "\u2018But in return he\nexpects us to behave like slaves.\u2019\n\u2018Slaves\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the word I used.",
    "You are his slave Alfred.",
    "If we have planned to go away and\nFather suddenly wishes us not to go you cancel your arrangements and remain without a\nmurmur If the whim takes him to send us away we go... We have no lives of our own\u2014no\nindependence.\u2019\nHer husband said distressfully \u2018I wish you wouldn\u2019t talk like this Lydia.",
    "It is very\nungrateful.",
    "My father has done everything for us...\u2019\n11\n\n\fShe bit off a retort that was on her lips.",
    "She shrugged those thin graceful shoulders once\nmore.",
    "Alfred said \u2018You know Lydia the old man is very fond of you\u2014\u2019\nHis wife said clearly and distinctly \u2018I am not at all fond of him.\u2019\n\u2018Lydia it distresses me to hear you say things like that.",
    "It is so unkind\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps.",
    "But sometimes a compulsion comes over one to speak the truth.\u2019\n\u2018If Father guessed\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Your father knows perfectly well that I do not like him It amuses him I think.\u2019\n\u2018Really Lydia I am sure you are wrong there.",
    "He has often told me how charming your\nmanner to him is.\u2019\n\u2018Naturally I\u2019ve always been polite.",
    "I always shall be.",
    "I\u2019m just letting you know what my real\nfeelings are.",
    "I dislike your father Alfred.",
    "I think he is a malicious and tyrannical old man.",
    "He bullies you and presumes on your affection for him.",
    "You ought to have stood up to him\nyears ago.\u2019\nAlfred said sharply \u2018That will do Lydia.",
    "Please don\u2019t say any more.\u2019\nShe sighed.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sorry.",
    "Perhaps I was wrong... Let\u2019s talk of our Christmas arrangements.",
    "Do you think\nyour brother David will really come\u2019\n\u2018Why not\u2019\nShe shook her head doubtfully.",
    "\u2018David is\u2014queer.",
    "He\u2019s not been inside the house for years remember.",
    "He was so devoted\nto your mother\u2014he\u2019s got some feeling about this place.\u2019\n\u2018David always got on Father\u2019s nerves\u2019 said Alfred \u2018with his music and his dreamy ways.",
    "Father was perhaps a bit hard on him sometimes.",
    "But I think David and Hilda will come all\nright.",
    "Christmas time you know.\u2019\n\u2018Peace and goodwill\u2019 said Lydia.",
    "Her delicate mouth curved ironically.",
    "\u2018I wonder George\nand Magdalene are coming.",
    "They said they would probably arrive tomorrow.",
    "I\u2019m afraid\nMagdalene will be frightfully bored.\u2019\nAlfred said with some slight annoyance \u2018Why my brother George ever married a girl\ntwenty years younger than himself I can\u2019t think George was always a fool\u2019\n12\n\n\f\u2018He\u2019s very successful in his career\u2019 said Lydia.",
    "\u2018His constituents like him.",
    "I believe\nMagdalene works quite hard politically for him.\u2019\nAlfred said slowly \u2018I don\u2019t think I like her very much.",
    "She is very good\u2010looking\u2014but I\nsometimes think she is like one of those beautiful pears one gets\u2014they have a rosy flush\nand a rather waxen appearance\u2014\u2019 He shook his head.",
    "\u2018And they\u2019re bad inside\u2019 said Lydia.",
    "\u2018How funny you should say that Alfred\u2019\n\u2018Why funny\u2019\nShe answered \u2018Because\u2014usually\u2014you are such a gentle soul.",
    "You hardly ever say an\nunkind thing about anyone.",
    "I get annoyed with you sometimes because you\u2019re not\nsufficiently\u2014oh what shall I say\u2014sufficiently suspicious\u2014not worldly enough\u2019\nHer husband smiled.",
    "\u2018The world I always think is as you yourself make it.\u2019\nLydia said sharply \u2018No Evil is not only in one\u2019s mind.",
    "Evil exists You seem to have no\nconsciousness of the evil in the world.",
    "I have.",
    "I can feel it.",
    "I\u2019ve always felt it\u2014here in this\nhouse\u2014\u2019 She bit her lip and turned away.",
    "Alfred said \u2018Lydia\u2014\u2019\nBut she raised a quick admonitory hand her eyes looking past him at something over his\nshoulder.",
    "Alfred turned.",
    "A dark man with a smooth face was standing there deferentially.",
    "Lydia said sharply \u2018What is it Horbury\u2019\nHorbury\u2019s voice was low a mere deferential murmur.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s Mr Lee madam.",
    "He asked me to tell you that there would be two more guests arriving\nfor Christmas and would you have rooms prepared for them.\u2019\nLydia said \u2018Two more guests\u2019\nHorbury said smoothly \u2018Yes madam another gentleman and a young lady.\u2019\nAlfred said wonderingly \u2018A young lady\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what Mr Lee said sir.\u2019\nLydia said quickly \u2018I will go up and see him\u2014\u2019\n\n13\n\n\fHorbury made one little step it was a mere ghost of a movement but it stopped Lydia\u2019s\nrapid progress automatically.",
    "\u2018Excuse me madam but Mr Lee is having his afternoon sleep.",
    "He asked specifically that he\nshould not be disturbed.\u2019\n\u2018I see\u2019 said Alfred.",
    "\u2018Of course we won\u2019t disturb him.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you sir.\u2019 Horbury withdrew.",
    "Lydia said vehemently \u2018How I dislike that man He creeps about the house like a cat One\nnever hears him going or coming.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t like him very much either.",
    "But he knows his job.",
    "It\u2019s not so easy to get a good male\nnurse attendant.",
    "And Father likes him that\u2019s the main thing.\u2019\n\u2018Yes that\u2019s the main thing as you say.",
    "Alfred what is this about a young lady What young\nlady\u2019\nHer husband shook his head.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t imagine.",

    "\u2018I\u2019ve been a wicked man.",
    "What do you say to that Pilar\u2019\nPilar shrugged her shoulders.",
    "She said \u2018All men are wicked.",
    "The nuns say so.",
    "That is why\none has to pray for them.\u2019\n\u2018Ah but I\u2019ve been more wicked than most.\u2019 Simeon laughed.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t regret it you know.",
    "No I don\u2019t regret anything.",
    "I\u2019ve enjoyed myself... every minute They say you repent when\nyou get old.",

    "\u2018No why should I be shocked Men always desire women.",
    "My father too.",
    "That is why\nwives are so often unhappy and why they go to church and pray.\u2019\nOld Simeon was frowning.",
    "35\n\n\f\u2018I made Adelaide unhappy\u2019 he said.",

    "\u2018Lord\nwhat a woman Pink and white and pretty as they make \u2019em when I married her And\nafterwards Always wailing and weeping.",

    "\u2018Look\nat \u2019em\u2014look at \u2019em Not a child among them\u2014to carry on What\u2019s the matter with them\nHaven\u2019t they got any of my blood in their veins Not a son among \u2019em legitimate or\nillegitimate.",

    "No she doesn\u2019t like me.",
    "But she has to put up with me for that nincompoop Alfred\u2019s sake.\u2019 He looked over at the\ngirl by the fire.",
    "\u2018Pilar\u2014remember\u2014nothing is so boring as devotion.\u2019\nShe smiled at him.",

    "He sat up and stared at her.",
    "He said \u2018What\u2019s that you\nsay\u2019\n\u2018I said have you paid for it Grandfather\u2019\nSimeon Lee said slowly \u2018I\u2014don\u2019t know...\u2019\nThen beating his fist on the arm of the chair he cried out with sudden anger \u2018What\nmakes you say that girl What makes you say that\u2019\nPilar said \u2018I\u2014wondered.\u2019\nHer hand holding the screen was arrested.",
    "Her eyes were dark and mysterious.",
    "She sat\nher head thrown back conscious of herself of her womanhood.",

    "And you have interesting things to say.",
    "You have travelled and\nyou have led a life of adventure.",
    "If I were a man I would be like that too.\u2019\nSimeon nodded.",
    "\u2018Yes I believe you would... We\u2019ve gipsy blood in us so it\u2019s always been said.",
    "It hasn\u2019t\nshown much in my children\u2014except Harry\u2014but I think it\u2019s come out in you.",
    "I can be\npatient mind you when it\u2019s necessary.",
    "I waited once fifteen years to get even with a man\nwho\u2019d done me an injury.",

    "Pilar said \u2018That was in South Africa\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "A grand country.\u2019\n37\n\n\f\u2018You have been back there yes\u2019\n\u2018I went back last five years after I married.",

    "Pilar shielding her face listened.",
    "His voice slowed wearied.",
    "He said \u2018Wait I\u2019ll show you something.\u2019\nHe pulled himself carefully to his feet.",
    "Then with his stick he limped slowly across the\nroom.",
    "He opened the big safe.",
    "Turning he beckoned her to him.",
    "\u2018There look at these.",
    "Feel them let them run through your fingers.\u2019\nHe looked into her wondering face and laughed.",
    "\u2018Do you know what they are Diamonds child diamonds.\u2019\nPilar\u2019s eyes opened.",
    "She said as she bent over \u2018But they are little pebbles that is all.\u2019\nSimeon laughed.",
    "\u2018They are uncut diamonds.",
    "That is how they are found\u2014like this.\u2019\nPilar asked incredulously \u2018And if they were cut they would be real diamonds\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.\u2019\n\u2018They would flash and sparkle\u2019\n\u2018Flash and sparkle.\u2019\nPilar said childishly \u2018O\u2010o\u2010o I cannot believe it\u2019\nHe was amused.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s quite true.\u2019\n\u2018They are valuable\u2019\n\u2018Fairly valuable.",
    "Difficult to say before they are cut.",
    "Anyway this little lot is worth several\nthousands of pounds.\u2019\n38\n\n\fPilar said with a space between each word \u2018Several\u2014thousands\u2014of\u2014pounds\u2019\n\u2018Say nine or ten thousands\u2014they\u2019re biggish stones you see.\u2019\nPilar asked her eyes opening \u2018But why do you not sell them then\u2019\n\u2018Because I like to have them here.\u2019\n\u2018But all that money\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t need the money.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2014I see\u2019 Pilar looked impressed.",
    "She said \u2018But why do you not have them cut and made beautiful\u2019\n\u2018Because I prefer them like this.\u2019 His face was set in a grim line.",
    "He turned away and began\nspeaking to himself.",
    "\u2018They take me back\u2014the touch of them the feel of them through my\nfingers...",
    "It all comes back to me the sunshine and the smell of the veldt the oxen\u2014old\nEb\u2014all the boys\u2014the evenings...\u2019\nThere was a soft tap on the door.",
    "Simeon said \u2018Put \u2019em back in the safe and bang it to.\u2019\nThen he called \u2018Come in.\u2019\nHorbury came in soft and deferential.",
    "He said \u2018Tea is ready downstairs.\u2019\nIII\nHilda said \u2018So there you are David.",
    "I\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere.",
    "Don\u2019t let\u2019s stay\nin this room it\u2019s so frightfully cold.\u2019\nDavid did not answer for a minute.",
    "He was standing looking at a chair a low chair with\nfaded satin upholstery.",
    "He said abruptly \u2018That\u2019s her chair... the chair she always sat in...\njust the same\u2014it\u2019s just the same.",
    "Only faded of course.\u2019\nA little frown creased Hilda\u2019s forehead.",
    "She said \u2018I see.",
    "Do let\u2019s come out of here David.",
    "It\u2019s frightfully cold.\u2019\nDavid took no notice.",
    "Looking round he said \u2018She sat in here mostly.",
    "I remember sitting\non that stool there while she read to me.",
    "Jack the Giant Killer\u2014that was it\u2014Jack the Giant\nKiller.",
    "I must have been six years old then.\u2019\nHilda put a firm hand through his arm.",
    "39\n\n\f\u2018Come back to the drawing\u2010room dear.",
    "There\u2019s no heating in this room.\u2019\nHe turned obediently but she felt a little shiver go through him.",
    "\u2018Just the same\u2019 he murmured.",
    "\u2018Just the same.",
    "As though time had stood still.\u2019\nHilda looked worried.",
    "She said in a cheerful determined voice \u2018I wonder where the others\nare It must be nearly tea\u2010time.\u2019\nDavid disengaged his arm and opened another door.",
    "\u2018There used to be a piano in here... Oh yes here it is I wonder if it\u2019s in tune.\u2019\nHe sat down and opened the lid running his hands lightly over the keys.",
    "\u2018Yes it\u2019s evidently kept tuned.\u2019\nHe began to play.",
    "His touch was good the melody flowed out from under his fingers.",
    "Hilda asked \u2018What is that I seem to know it and I can\u2019t quite remember.\u2019\nHe said \u2018I haven\u2019t played it for years.",
    "She used to play it.",
    "One of Mendelssohn\u2019s Songs\nWithout Words.\u2019\nThe sweet over\u2010sweet melody filled the room.",
    "Hilda said \u2018Play some Mozart do.\u2019\nDavid shook his head.",
    "He began another Mendelssohn.",
    "Then suddenly he brought his hands down upon the keys in a harsh discord.",
    "He got up.",
    "He\nwas trembling all over.",
    "Hilda went to him.",
    "She said \u2018David\u2014David.\u2019\nHe said \u2018It\u2019s nothing\u2014it\u2019s nothing...\u2019\nIV\nThe bell pealed aggressively.",
    "Tressilian rose from his seat in the pantry and went slowly\nout and along to the door.",
    "The bell pealed again.",
    "Tressilian frowned.",
    "Through the frosted glass of the door he saw the\nsilhouette of a man wearing a slouch hat.",
    "Tressilian passed a hand over his forehead.",
    "Something worried him.",
    "It was as though\neverything was happening twice.",
    "Surely this had happened before.",
    "Surely\u2014\n40\n\n\fHe drew back the latch and opened the door.",
    "Then the spell broke.",
    "The man standing there said \u2018Is this where Mr Simeon Lee lives\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d like to see him please.\u2019\nA faint echo of memory awoke in Tressilian.",
    "It was an intonation of voice that he\nremembered from the old days when Mr Lee was first in England.",
    "Tressilian shook his head dubiously.",
    "\u2018Mr Lee is an invalid sir.",
    "He doesn\u2019t see many people now.",
    "If you\u2014\u2019\nThe stranger interrupted.",
    "He drew out an envelope and handed it to the butler.",
    "\u2018Please give this to Mr Lee.\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\nV\nSimeon Lee took the envelope.",
    "He drew out the single sheet of paper it held.",
    "He looked\nsurprised.",
    "His eyebrows rose but he smiled.",
    "\u2018By all that\u2019s wonderful\u2019 he said.",
    "Then to the butler \u2018Show Mr Farr up here Tressilian.\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\nSimeon said \u2018I was just thinking of old Ebenezer Farr.",
    "He was my partner out there in\nKimberley.",
    "Now here\u2019s his son come along\u2019\nTressilian reappeared.",
    "He announced \u2018Mr Farr.\u2019\nStephen Farr came in with a trace of nervousness.",
    "He disguised it by putting on a little\nextra swagger.",
    "He said\u2014and just for the moment his South African accent was more\nmarked than usual \u2018Mr Lee\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m glad to see you.",
    "So you\u2019re Eb\u2019s boy\u2019\nStephen Farr grinned rather sheepishly.",
    "41\n\n\fHe said \u2018My first visit to the old country.",
    "Father always told me to look you up if I did\ncome.\u2019\n\u2018Quite right.\u2019 The old man looked round.",
    "\u2018This is my granddaughter Pilar Estravados.\u2019\n\u2018How do you do\u2019 said Pilar demurely.",
    "Stephen Farr thought with a touch of admiration \u2018Cool little devil.",
    "She was surprised to\nsee me but it only showed for a flash.\u2019\nHe said rather heavily \u2018I\u2019m very pleased to make your acquaintance Miss Estravados.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you\u2019 said Pilar.",
    "Simeon Lee said \u2018Sit down and tell me all about yourself.",
    "Are you in England for long\u2019\n\u2018Oh I shan\u2019t hurry myself now I\u2019ve really got here\u2019\nHe laughed throwing his head back.",
    "Simeon Lee said \u2018Quite right.",
    "You must stay here with us for a while.\u2019\n\u2018Oh look here sir.",
    "I can\u2019t butt in like that.",
    "It\u2019s only two days to Christmas.\u2019\n\u2018You must spend Christmas with us\u2014unless you\u2019ve got other plans\u2019\n\u2018Well no I haven\u2019t but I don\u2019t like\u2014\u2019\nSimeon said \u2018That\u2019s settled.\u2019 He turned his head.",
    "\u2018Pilar\u2019\n\u2018Yes Grandfather.\u2019\n\u2018Go and tell Lydia we shall have another guest.",
    "Ask her to come up here.\u2019\nPilar left the room.",
    "Stephen\u2019s eyes followed her.",
    "Simeon noted the fact with amusement.",
    "He said \u2018You\u2019ve come straight here from South Africa\u2019\n\u2018Pretty well.\u2019\nThey began to talk of that country.",
    "Lydia entered a few minutes later.",
    "Simeon said \u2018This is Stephen Farr son of my old friend and partner Ebenezer Farr.",
    "He\u2019s\ngoing to be with us for Christmas if you can find room for him.\u2019\nLydia smiled.",
    "42\n\n\f\u2018Of course.\u2019 Her eyes took in the stranger\u2019s appearance.",
    "His bronzed face and blue eyes\nand the easy backward tilt of his head.",
    "\u2018My daughter\u2010in\u2010law\u2019 said Simeon.",
    "Stephen said \u2018I feel rather embarrassed\u2014butting in on a family party like this.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re one of the family my boy\u2019 said Simeon.",
    "\u2018Think of yourself as that.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re too kind sir.\u2019\nPilar re\u2010entered the room.",
    "She sat down quietly by the fire and picked up the hand screen.",
    "She used it as a fan slowly tilting her wrist to and fro.",
    "Her eyes were demure and\ndowncast.",
    "43\n\n\f44\n\n\fPart 3\nDecember 24th\n\u2018Do you really want me to stay on here Father\u2019 asked Harry.",
    "He tilted his head back.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m\nstirring up rather a hornet\u2019s nest you know.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean\u2019 asked Simeon sharply.",
    "\u2018Brother Alfred\u2019 said Harry.",
    "\u2018Good brother Alfred He if I may say so resents my presence\nhere.\u2019\n\u2018The devil he does\u2019 snapped Simeon.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m master in this house.\u2019\n\u2018All the same sir I expect you\u2019re pretty dependent on Alfred.",
    "I don\u2019t want to upset\u2014\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll do as I tell you\u2019 snapped his father.",

    "Mrs David now a nice lady but didn\u2019t have any idea of how to\ndress.",
    "For her figure plain black velvet would have been the best.",
    "Figured velvet and\ncrimson at that was a bad choice.",
    "Miss Pilar now it didn\u2019t matter what she wore with\nher figure and her hair she looked well in anything.",

    "Properly taken with her he was.",
    "Didn\u2019t seem to be anything on their minds\nMr David Tressilian felt worried about Mr David.",
    "Just like his mother he was to look at.",

    "Tressilian whisked it away mopped up the stream deftly.",
    "It was all over.",

    "He pushed his way forward gently thrusting the ladies aside.",
    "Alfred Lee recognized him.",
    "\u2018Ah\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s you Superintendent Sugden.",
    "You\u2019ve got here very quickly.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Mr Lee.\u2019 Superintendent Sugden did not waste time on explanations.",
    "\u2018What\u2019s all\nthis\u2019\n\u2018My father\u2019 said Alfred Lee \u2018has been killed\u2014murdered...\u2019\nHis voice broke.",

    "\u2018Nothing must be touched or disturbed.\u2019\nShe stared at him.",
    "Stephen Farr said impatiently \u2018Of course not.",
    "She understands that.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said still in the same pleasant manner \u2018You picked up something\nfrom the floor just now\u2019\nPilar\u2019s eyes opened.",
    "She stared and said incredulously \u2018I did\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden was still pleasant.",
    "His voice was just a little firmer.",

    "It\u2019s in your hand now.\u2019\nSlowly Pilar unclosed her hand.",
    "There lay in it a wisp of rubber and a small object made of\nwood.",
    "Superintendent Sugden took them enclosed them in an envelope and put them\naway in his breast pocket.",
    "He said \u2018Thank you.\u2019\nHe turned away.",
    "Just for a minute Stephen Farr\u2019s eyes showed a startled respect.",
    "It was as\nthough he had underestimated the large handsome superintendent.",
    "55\n\n\fThey went slowly out of the room.",
    "Behind them they heard the superintendent\u2019s voice\nsaying officially \u2018And now if you please...\u2019\nV\n\u2018Nothing like a wood fire\u2019 said Colonel Johnson as he threw on an additional log and then\ndrew his chair nearer to the blaze.",

    "The guest raised a polite hand in negation.",
    "Cautiously he edged his own chair nearer to\nthe blazing logs though he was of the opinion that the opportunity for roasting the soles\nof one\u2019s feet like some mediaeval torture did not offset the cold draught that swirled\nround the back of the shoulders.",
    "Colonel Johnson Chief Constable of Middleshire might be of the opinion that nothing\ncould beat a wood fire but Hercule Poirot was of the opinion that central heating could\nand did every time\n\u2018Amazing business that Cartwright case\u2019 remarked the host reminiscently.",
    "\u2018Amazing man\nEnormous charm of manner.",
    "Why when he came here with you he had us all eating out\nof his hand.\u2019\nHe shook his head.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ll never have anything like that case\u2019 he said.",

    "\u2018A device of foreigners Unsportsmanlike\u2019\n\u2018I hardly think we could say that\u2019 said the chief constable.",
    "\u2018Plenty of poisoning by\narsenic\u2014probably a good deal more than has ever been suspected.\u2019\n\u2018Possibly yes.\u2019\n\u2018Always an awkward business a poisoning case\u2019 said Johnson.",

    "Don\u2019t harbour the idea that I like murder\ncases Hope I never have another.",
    "Anyway we ought to be safe enough during your visit.\u2019\nPoirot began modestly \u2018My reputation\u2014\u2019\n56\n\n\fBut Johnson had gone on.",

    "He joined his fingertips.",
    "He studied his host\nthoughtfully.",
    "He murmured \u2018It is then your opinion that Christmas time is an unlikely season for\ncrime\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what I said.\u2019\n\u2018Why\u2019\n\u2018Why\u2019 Johnson was thrown slightly out of his stride.",
    "\u2018Well as I\u2019ve just said\u2014season of\ngood cheer and all that\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018The British they are so sentimental\u2019\nJohnson said stoutly \u2018What if we are What if we do like the old ways the old traditional\nfestivities What\u2019s the harm\u2019\n\u2018There is no harm.",
    "It is all most charming But let us for a moment examine facts.",
    "You have\nsaid that Christmas is a season of good cheer.",
    "That means does it not a lot of eating and\ndrinking It means in fact the over eating And with the overeating there comes the\nindigestion And with the indigestion there comes the irritability\u2019\n\u2018Crimes\u2019 said Colonel Johnson \u2018are not committed from irritability.\u2019\n\u2018I am not so sure Take another point.",
    "There is at Christmas a spirit of goodwill.",
    "It is as\nyou say \u201cthe thing to do\u201d.",
    "Old quarrels are patched up those who have disagreed consent\nto agree once more even if it is only temporarily.\u2019\nJohnson nodded.",
    "\u2018Bury the hatchet that\u2019s right.\u2019\nPoirot pursued his theme \u2018And families now families who have been separated\nthroughout the year assemble once more together.",
    "Now under these conditions my\nfriend you must admit that there will occur a great amount of strain.",
    "People who do not\nfeel amiable are putting great pressure on themselves to appear amiable There is at\nChristmas time a great deal of hypocrisy honourable hypocrisy hypocrisy undertaken\npour le bon motif c\u2019est entendu but nevertheless hypocrisy\u2019\n\u2018Well I shouldn\u2019t put it quite like that myself\u2019 said Colonel Johnson doubtfully.",
    "Poirot beamed upon him.",
    "57\n\n\f\u2018No no.",
    "It is I who am putting it like that not you.",
    "I am pointing out to you that under\nthese conditions\u2014mental strain physical malaise\u2014it is highly probable that dislikes that\nwere before merely mild and disagreements that were trivial might suddenly assume a\nmore serious character.",
    "The result of pretending to be a more amiable a more forgiving a\nmore high\u2010minded person than one really is has sooner or later the effect of causing one\nto behave as a more disagreeable a more ruthless and an altogether more unpleasant\nperson than is actually the case If you dam the stream of natural behaviour mon ami\nsooner or later the dam bursts and a cataclysm occurs\u2019\nColonel Johnson looked at him doubtfully.",
    "\u2018Never know when you\u2019re serious and when you\u2019re pulling my leg\u2019 he grumbled.",
    "Poirot smiled at him.",

    "\u2018Superintendent Sugden on the phone sir.\u2019\n\u2018Right.",

    "He sunk an immense fortune in manufacturing\nsome particular gadget of mining machinery.",
    "His own invention I believe.",
    "Anyway it\u2019s\npaid him hand over fist They say he\u2019s a millionaire twice over.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018He was well liked yes\u2019\n\n58\n\n\fJohnson said slowly \u2018Don\u2019t think anyone liked him.",
    "Queer sort of chap.",
    "He\u2019s been an\ninvalid for some years now.",
    "I don\u2019t know very much about him myself.",
    "But of course he is\none of the big figures of the county.\u2019\n\u2018So this case it will make a big stir\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "I must get over to Longdale as fast as I can.\u2019\nHe hesitated looking at his guest.",
    "Poirot answered the unspoken question \u2018You would like\nthat I should accompany you\u2019\nJohnson said awkwardly \u2018Seems a shame to ask you.",
    "But well you know how it is\nSuperintendent Sugden is a good man none better painstaking careful thoroughly\nsound\u2014but\u2014well he\u2019s not an imaginative chap in any way.",
    "Should like very much as you\nare here benefit of your advice.\u2019\nHe halted a little over the end part of his speech making it somewhat telegraphic in style.",
    "Poirot responded quickly.",
    "\u2018I shall be delighted.",
    "You can count on me to assist you in any way I can.",
    "We must not hurt\nthe feelings of the good superintendent.",
    "It will be his case\u2014not mine.",
    "I am only the\nunofficial consultant.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said warmly \u2018You\u2019re a good fellow Poirot.\u2019\nWith those words of commendation the two men started out.",
    "VI\nIt was a constable who opened the front door to them and saluted.",
    "Behind him\nSuperintendent Sugden advanced down the hall and said \u2018Glad you\u2019ve got here sir.",
    "Shall\nwe come into this room here on the left\u2014Mr Lee\u2019s study I\u2019d like to run over the main\noutlines.",
    "The whole thing\u2019s a rum business.\u2019\nHe ushered them into a small room on the left of the hall.",
    "There was a telephone there\nand a big desk covered with papers.",
    "The walls were lined with bookcases.",
    "The chief constable said \u2018Sugden this is M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "You may have heard of him.",
    "Just happened to be staying with me.",
    "Superintendent Sugden.\u2019\nPoirot made a little bow and looked the other man over.",
    "He saw a tall man with square\nshoulders and a military bearing who had an aquiline nose a pugnacious jaw and a large\nflourishing chestnut\u2010coloured moustache.",
    "Sugden stared hard at Hercule Poirot after\nacknowledging the introduction.",
    "Hercule Poirot stared hard at Superintendent Sugden\u2019s\nmoustache.",
    "Its luxuriance seemed to fascinate him.",
    "59\n\n\fThe superintendent said \u2018Of course I have heard of you Mr Poirot.",
    "You were in this part\nof the world some years ago if I remember rightly.",
    "Death of Sir Bartholomew Strange.",
    "Poisoning case.",
    "Nicotine.",
    "Not my district but of course I heard all about it.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said impatiently \u2018Now then Sugden let\u2019s have the facts.",
    "A clear case\nyou said.\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir it\u2019s murder right enough\u2014not a doubt of that.",
    "Mr Lee\u2019s throat was cut\u2014jugular\nvein severed I understand from the doctor.",
    "But there\u2019s something very odd about the\nwhole matter.\u2019\n\u2018You mean\u2014\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d like you to hear my story first sir.",
    "These are the circumstances This afternoon about\nfive o\u2019clock I was rung up by Mr Lee at Addlesfield police station.",
    "He sounded a bit odd\nover the phone\u2014asked me to come and see him at eight o\u2019clock this evening\u2014made a\nspecial point of the time.",
    "Moreover he instructed me to say to the butler that I was\ncollecting subscriptions for some police charity.\u2019\nThe chief constable looked up sharply.",
    "\u2018Wanted some plausible pretext to get you into the house\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s right sir.",
    "Well naturally Mr Lee is an important person and I acceded to his\nrequest.",
    "I got here a little before eight o\u2019clock and represented myself as seeking\nsubscriptions for the Police Orphanage.",
    "The butler went away and returned to tell me that\nMr Lee would see me.",
    "Thereupon he showed me up to Mr Lee\u2019s room which is situated\non the first floor immediately over the dining\u2010room.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden paused drew a breath and then proceeded in a somewhat official\nmanner with his report.",
    "\u2018Mr Lee was seated in a chair by the fireplace.",
    "He was wearing a dressing\u2010gown.",
    "When the\nbutler had left the room and closed the door Mr Lee asked me to sit near him.",
    "He then\nsaid rather hesitatingly that he wanted to give me particulars of a robbery.",
    "I asked him\nwhat had been taken.",
    "He replied that he had reason to believe that diamonds uncut\ndiamonds I think he said to the value of several thousand pounds had been stolen from\nhis safe.\u2019\n\u2018Diamonds eh\u2019 said the chief constable.",
    "\u2018Yes sir.",
    "I asked him various routine questions but his manner was very uncertain and his\nreplies were somewhat vague in character.",
    "At last he said \u201cYou must understand\nSuperintendent that I may be mistaken in this matter.\u201d I said \u201cI do not quite understand\nsir.",
    "Either the diamonds are missing or they are not missing\u2014one or the other.\u201d He\nreplied \u201cThe diamonds are certainly missing but it is just possible Superintendent that\ntheir disappearance may be simply a rather foolish kind of practical joke.\u201d Well that\nseemed odd to me but I said nothing.",
    "He went on \u201cIt is difficult for me to explain in\n60\n\n\fdetail but what it amounts to is this So far as I can see only two persons can possibly\nhave the stones.",
    "One of those persons might have done it as a joke.",
    "If the other person\ntook them then they have definitely been stolen.\u201d I said \u201cWhat exactly do you want me\nto do sir\u201d He said quickly \u201cI want you Superintendent to return here in about an hour\u2014\nno make it a little more than that\u2014say nine\u2010fifteen.",
    "At that time I shall be able to tell you\ndefinitely whether I have been robbed or not.\u201d I was a little mystified but I agreed and\nwent away.\u2019\nColonel Johnson commented \u2018Curious\u2014very curious.",
    "What do you say Poirot\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018May I ask Superintendent what conclusions you yourself drew\u2019\nThe superintendent stroked his jaw as he replied carefully \u2018Well various ideas occurred to\nme but on the whole I figured it out this way.",
    "There was no question of any practical\njoke.",
    "The diamonds had been stolen all right.",
    "But the old gentleman wasn\u2019t sure who\u2019d\ndone it.",
    "It\u2019s my opinion that he was speaking the truth when he said that it might have\nbeen one of two people\u2014and of those two people one was a servant and the other was a\nmember of the family.\u2019\nPoirot nodded appreciatively.",
    "\u2018Tr\u00e8s bien.",
    "Yes that explains his attitude very well.\u2019\n\u2018Hence his desire that I should return later.",
    "In the interval he meant to have an interview\nwith the person in question.",
    "He would tell them that he had already spoken of the matter\nto the police but that if restitution were promptly made he could hush the matter up.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018And if the suspect didn\u2019t respond\u2019\n\u2018In that case he meant to place the investigation in our hands.\u2019\nColonel Johnson frowned and twisted his moustache.",
    "He demurred.",
    "\u2018Why not take that course before calling you in\u2019\n\u2018No no sir.\u2019 The superintendent shook his head.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t you see if he had done that it\nmight have been bluff.",
    "It wouldn\u2019t have been half so convincing.",
    "The person might say to\nhimself \u201cThe old man won\u2019t call the police in no matter what he suspects\u201d But if the old\ngentleman says to him \u201cI\u2019ve already spoken to the police the superintendent has only just\nleft.\u201d Then the thief asks the butler say and the butler confirms that.",
    "He says \u201cYes the\nsuperintendent was here just before dinner.\u201d Then the chief is convinced the old\ngentleman means business and it\u2019s up to him to cough up the stones.\u2019\n\u2018H\u2019m yes I see that\u2019 said Colonel Johnson.",
    "\u2018Any idea Sugden who this \u201cmember of the\nfamily\u201d might be\u2019\n\u2018No sir.\u2019\n61\n\n\f\u2018No indication whatsoever\u2019\n\u2018None.\u2019\nJohnson shook his head.",
    "Then he said \u2018Well let\u2019s get on with it.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden resumed his official manner.",
    "\u2018I returned to the house sir at nine\u2010fifteen precisely.",
    "Just as I was about to ring the front\ndoor bell I heard a scream from inside the house and then a confused sound of shouts\nand a general commotion.",
    "I rang several times and also used the knocker.",
    "It was three or\nfour minutes before the door was answered.",
    "When the footman at last opened it I could\nsee that something momentous had occurred.",
    "He was shaking all over and looked as\nthough he was about to faint.",
    "He gasped out that Mr Lee had been murdered.",
    "I ran hastily\nupstairs.",
    "I found Mr Lee\u2019s room in a state of wild confusion.",
    "There had evidently been a\nsevere struggle.",
    "Mr Lee himself was lying in front of the fire with his throat cut in a pool of\nblood.\u2019\nThe chief constable said sharply \u2018He couldn\u2019t have done it himself\u2019\nSugden shook his head.",
    "\u2018Impossible sir.",
    "For one thing there were the chairs and tables overturned and the\nbroken crockery and ornaments and then there was no sign of the razor or knife with\nwhich the crime had been committed.\u2019\nThe chief constable said thoughtfully \u2018Yes that seems conclusive.",
    "Anyone in the room\u2019\n\u2018Most of the family were there sir.",
    "Just standing round.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said sharply \u2018Any ideas Sugden\u2019\nThe superintendent said slowly \u2018It\u2019s a bad business sir.",
    "It looks to me as though one of\nthem must have done it.",
    "I don\u2019t see how anyone from outside could have done it and got\naway in time.\u2019\n\u2018What about the window Closed or open\u2019\n\u2018There are two windows in the room sir.",
    "One was closed and locked.",
    "The other was open\na few inches at the bottom\u2014but it was fixed in that position by a burglar screw and\nmoreover I\u2019ve tried it and it\u2019s stuck fast\u2014hasn\u2019t been opened for years I should say.",
    "Also\nthe wall outside is quite smooth and unbroken\u2014no ivy or creepers.",
    "I don\u2019t see how\nanyone could have left that way.\u2019\n\u2018How many doors in the room\u2019\n\n62\n\n\f\u2018Just one.",
    "The room is at the end of a passage.",
    "That door was locked on the inside.",
    "When\nthey heard the noise of the struggle and the old man\u2019s dying scream and rushed upstairs\nthey had to break down the door to get in.\u2019\nJohnson said sharply \u2018And who was in the room\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden replied gravely \u2018Nobody was in the room sir except the old man\nwho had been killed not more than a few minutes previously.\u2019\nVII\nColonel Johnson stared at Sugden for some minutes before he spluttered \u2018Do you mean\nto tell me Superintendent that this is one of those damned cases you get in detective\nstories where a man is killed in a locked room by some apparently supernatural agency\u2019\nA very faint smile agitated the superintendent\u2019s moustache as he replied gravely \u2018I do not\nthink it\u2019s quite as bad as that sir.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018Suicide.",
    "It must be suicide\u2019\n\u2018Where\u2019s the weapon if so No sir suicide won\u2019t do.\u2019\n\u2018Then how did the murderer escape By the window\u2019 Sugden shook his head.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll take my oath he didn\u2019t do that.\u2019\n\u2018But the door was locked you say on the inside.\u2019\nThe superintendent nodded.",
    "He drew a key from his pocket and laid it on the table.",
    "\u2018No fingerprints\u2019 he announced.",
    "\u2018But just look at that key sir.",
    "Take a look at it with that\nmagnifying glass there.\u2019\nPoirot bent forward.",
    "He and Johnson examined the key together.",
    "The chief constable\nuttered an exclamation.",
    "\u2018By Jove I get you.",
    "Those faint scratches on the end of the barrel.",
    "You see \u2019em Poirot\u2019\n\u2018But yes I see.",
    "That means does it not that the key was turned from outside the door\u2014\nturned by means of a special implement that went through the keyhole and gripped the\nbarrel\u2014possibly an ordinary pair of pliers would do it.\u2019\nThe superintendent nodded.",
    "\u2018It can be done all right.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018The idea being then that the death would be thought to be suicide since the\ndoor was locked and no one was in the room\u2019\n63\n\n\f\u2018That was the idea M. Poirot not a doubt of it I should say.\u2019\nPoirot shook his head doubtfully.",
    "\u2018But the disorder in the room As you say that by itself wiped out the idea of suicide.",
    "Surely the murderer would first of all have set the room to rights.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said \u2018But he hadn\u2019t time Mr Poirot.",
    "That\u2019s the whole point.",
    "He\nhadn\u2019t time.",
    "Let\u2019s say he counted on catching the old gentleman unawares.",
    "Well that\ndidn\u2019t come off.",
    "There was a struggle\u2014a struggle heard plainly in the room underneath\nand what\u2019s more the old gentleman called out for help.",
    "Everyone came rushing up.",
    "The\nmurderer\u2019s only got time to nip out of the room and turn the key from the outside.\u2019\n\u2018That is true\u2019 Poirot admitted.",
    "\u2018Your murderer he may have made the bungle.",
    "But why oh\nwhy did he not at least leave the weapon For naturally if there is no weapon it cannot\nbe suicide That was an error most grave.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said stolidly \u2018Criminals usually make mistakes.",
    "That\u2019s our\nexperience.\u2019\nPoirot gave a light sigh.",
    "He murmured \u2018But all the same in spite of his mistakes he has\nescaped this criminal.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think he has exactly escaped.\u2019\n\u2018You mean he is in the house still\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t see where else he can be.",
    "It was an inside job.\u2019\n\u2018But tout de m\u00eame\u2019 Poirot pointed out gently \u2018he has escaped to this extent You do not\nknow who he is.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said gently bur firmly \u2018I rather fancy that we soon shall.",
    "We\nhaven\u2019t done any questioning of the household yet.\u2019\nColonel Johnson cut in \u2018Look here Sugden one thing strikes me.",
    "Whoever turned that key\nfrom the outside must have had some knowledge of the job.",
    "That\u2019s to say he probably has\nhad criminal experience.",
    "These sort of tools aren\u2019t easy to manage.\u2019\n\u2018You mean it was a professional job sir\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what I mean.\u2019\n\u2018It does seem like it\u2019 the other admitted.",
    "\u2018Following that up it looks as though there were\na professional thief among the servants.",
    "That would explain the diamonds being taken and\nthe murder would follow on logically from that.\u2019\n\u2018Well anything wrong with that theory\u2019\n64\n\n\f\u2018It\u2019s what I thought myself to begin with.",
    "But it\u2019s difficult.",
    "There are eight servants in the\nhouse six of them are women and of those six five have been here for four years and\nmore.",
    "Then there\u2019s the butler and the footman.",
    "The butler has been here for close on\nforty years\u2014bit of a record that I should say.",
    "The footman\u2019s local son of the gardener\nand brought up here.",
    "Don\u2019t see very well how he can be a professional.",
    "The only other\nperson is Mr Lee\u2019s valet attendant.",
    "He\u2019s comparatively new but he was out of the house\u2014\nstill is\u2014went out just before eight o\u2019clock.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018Have you got a list of just who exactly was in the house\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "I got it from the butler.\u2019 He took out his note\u2010book.",
    "\u2018Shall I read it to you\u2019\n\u2018Please Sugden.\u2019\n\u2018Mr and Mrs Alfred Lee.",
    "Mr George Lee M.P.",
    "and his wife Mr Henry Lee Mr and Mrs\nDavid Lee.",
    "Miss\u2019\u2014the superintendent paused a little taking the words carefully\u2014\u2018Pilar\u2019\u2014\nhe pronounced it like a piece of architecture\u2014\u2018Estravados.",
    "Mr Stephen Farr.",
    "Then for the\nservants Edward Tressilian butler.",
    "Walter Champion footman.",
    "Emily Reeves cook.",

    "As I told you I haven\u2019t questioned anybody yet.",
    "According to Tressilian the\ngentlemen were in the dining\u2010room still.",
    "The ladies had gone to the drawing\u2010room.",
    "Tressilian had served coffee.",
    "According to his statement he had just got back to his pantry\nwhen he heard a noise upstairs.",
    "It was followed by a scream.",
    "He ran out into the hall and\nupstairs in the wake of the others.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018How many of the family live in the house and who are just staying\nhere\u2019\n\u2018Mr and Mrs Alfred Lee live here.",
    "The others are just visiting.\u2019\nJohnson nodded.",
    "\u2018Where are they all\u2019\n\u2018I asked them to stay in the drawing\u2010room until I was ready to take their statements.\u2019\n\u2018I see.",
    "Well we\u2019d better go upstairs and take a look at the doings.\u2019\nThe superintendent led the way up the broad stairs and along the passage.",
    "65\n\n\fAs he entered the room where the crime had taken place Johnson drew a deep breath.",
    "\u2018Pretty horrible\u2019 he commented.",
    "He stood for a minute studying the overturned chairs the smashed china and the blood\u2010\nbespattered d\u00e9bris.",
    "A thin elderly man stood up from where he had been kneeling by the body and gave a\nnod.",
    "\u2018Evening Johnson\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Bit of a shambles eh\u2019\n\u2018I should say it was.",
    "Got anything for us doctor\u2019\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He grinned.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll let you have the scientific language at the inquest Nothing complicated about it.",
    "Throat cut like a pig.",
    "He bled to death in less than a minute.",
    "No sign of the weapon.\u2019\nPoirot went across the room to the windows.",
    "As the superintendent had said one was\nshut and bolted.",
    "The other was open about four inches at the bottom.",
    "A thick patent\nscrew of the kind known many years ago as an anti\u2010burglar screw secured it in that\nposition.",
    "Sugden said \u2018According to the butler that window was never shut wet or fine.",
    "There\u2019s a\nlinoleum mat underneath it in case rain beat in but it didn\u2019t much as the overhanging\nroof protects it.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He came back to the body and stared down at the old man.",
    "The lips were drawn back from the bloodless gums in something that looked like a snarl.",
    "The fingers were curved like claws.",
    "Poirot said \u2018He does not seem a strong man no.\u2019\nThe doctor said \u2018He was pretty tough I believe.",
    "He\u2019d survived several pretty bad illnesses\nthat would have killed most men.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I do not mean that.",
    "I mean he was not big not strong physically.\u2019\n\u2018No he\u2019s frail enough.\u2019\nPoirot turned from the dead man.",
    "He bent to examine an overturned chair a big chair of\nmahogany.",
    "Beside it was a round mahogany table and the fragments of a big china lamp.",
    "Two other smaller chairs lay nearby also the smashed fragments of a decanter and two\nglasses a heavy glass paperweight was unbroken some miscellaneous books a big\n66\n\n\fJapanese vase smashed in pieces and a bronze statuette of a naked girl completed the\nd\u00e9bris.",
    "Poirot bent over all these exhibits studying them gravely but without touching them.",
    "He\nfrowned to himself as though perplexed.",
    "The chief constable said \u2018Anything strike you Poirot\u2019\nHercule Poirot sighed.",
    "He murmured \u2018Such a frail shrunken old man\u2014and yet\u2014all this.\u2019\nJohnson looked puzzled.",
    "He turned away and said to the sergeant who was busy at his\nwork \u2018What about prints\u2019\n\u2018Plenty of them sir all over the room.\u2019\n\u2018What about the safe\u2019\n\u2018No good.",
    "Only prints on that are those of the old gentleman himself.\u2019\nJohnson turned to the doctor.",
    "\u2018What about bloodstains\u2019 he asked.",
    "\u2018Surely whoever killed him must have got blood on\nhim.\u2019\nThe doctor said doubtfully \u2018Not necessarily.",
    "Bleeding was almost entirely from the jugular\nvein.",
    "That wouldn\u2019t spout like an artery.\u2019\n\u2018No no.",
    "Still there seems a lot of blood about.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Yes there is a lot of blood\u2014it strikes one that.",
    "A lot of blood.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said respectfully \u2018Do you\u2014er\u2014does that suggest anything to you\nMr Poirot\u2019\nPoirot looked about him.",
    "He shook his head perplexedly.",
    "He said \u2018There is something here\u2014some violence...\u2019 He stopped a minute then went on\n\u2018Yes that is it\u2014violence... And blood\u2014an insistence on blood...",
    "There is\u2014how shall I put\nit\u2014there is too much blood.",
    "Blood on the chairs on the tables on the carpet...",
    "The blood\nritual Sacrificial blood Is that it Perhaps.",
    "Such a frail old man so thin so shrivelled so\ndried up\u2014and yet\u2014in his death\u2014so much blood...\u2019\nHis voice died away.",
    "Superintendent Sugden staring at him with round startled eyes said\nin an awed voice \u2018Funny\u2014that\u2019s what she said\u2014the lady...\u2019\nPoirot said sharply \u2018What lady What was it she said\u2019\n\n67\n\n\fSugden answered \u2018Mrs Lee\u2014Mrs Alfred.",
    "Stood over there by the door and half whispered\nit.",
    "It didn\u2019t make sense to me.\u2019\n\u2018What did she say\u2019\n\u2018Something about who would have thought the old gentleman had so much blood in\nhim...\u2019\nPoirot said softly \u2018\u201cWho would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in\nhim\u201d The words of Lady Macbeth.",
    "She said that... Ah that is interesting...\u2019\nVIII\nAlfred Lee and his wife came into the small study where Poirot Sugden and the chief\nconstable were standing waiting.",
    "Colonel Johnson came forward.",
    "\u2018How do you do Mr Lee We\u2019ve never actually met but as you know I\u2019m chief constable\nof the county.",
    "Johnson\u2019s my name.",
    "I can\u2019t tell you how distressed I am by this.\u2019\nAlfred his brown eyes like those of a suffering dog said hoarsely \u2018Thank you.",
    "It\u2019s\nterrible\u2014quite terrible.",
    "I\u2014this is my wife.\u2019\nLydia said in her quiet voice \u2018It has been a frightful shock to my husband\u2014to all of us\u2014\nbut particularly to him.\u2019\nHer hand was on her husband\u2019s shoulder.",
    "Colonel Johnson said \u2018Won\u2019t you sit down Mrs Lee Let me introduce M. Hercule Poirot.\u2019\nHercule Poirot bowed.",
    "His eyes went interestedly from husband to wife.",
    "Lydia\u2019s hands pressed gently on Alfred\u2019s shoulder.",
    "\u2018Sit down Alfred.\u2019\nAlfred sat.",
    "He murmured \u2018Hercule Poirot.",
    "Now who\u2014who\u2014\u2019\nHe passed his hand in a dazed fashion over his forehead.",
    "Lydia Lee said \u2018Colonel Johnson will want to ask you a lot of questions Alfred.\u2019\nThe chief constable looked at her with approval.",
    "He was thankful that Mrs Alfred Lee was\nturning out to be such a sensible and competent woman.",
    "Alfred said \u2018Of course.",
    "Of course...\u2019\nJohnson said to himself \u2018Shock seems to have knocked him out completely.",
    "Hope he can\npull himself together a bit.\u2019\n68\n\n\fAloud he said \u2018I\u2019ve got a list here of everybody who was in the house tonight.",
    "Perhaps\nyou\u2019ll tell me Mr Lee if it is correct.\u2019\nHe made a slight gesture to Sugden and the latter pulled out his note\u2010book and once more\nrecited the list of names.",
    "The businesslike procedure seemed to restore Alfred Lee to something more like his\nnormal self.",
    "He had regained command of himself his eyes no longer looked dazed and\nstaring.",
    "When Sugden finished he nodded in agreement.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s quite right\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Do you mind telling me a little more about your guests Mr and Mrs George Lee and Mr\nand Mrs David Lee are I gather relatives\u2019\n\u2018They are my two younger brothers and their wives.\u2019\n\u2018They are staying here only\u2019\n\u2018Yes they came to us for Christmas.\u2019\n\u2018Mr Henry Lee is also a brother\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018And your two other guests Miss Estravados and Mr Farr\u2019\n\u2018Miss Estravados is my niece.",
    "Mr Farr is the son of my father\u2019s one\u2010time partner in South\nAfrica.\u2019\n\u2018Ah an old friend.\u2019\nLydia intervened.",
    "\u2018No actually we have never seen him before.\u2019\n\u2018I see.",
    "But you invited him to stay with you for Christmas\u2019\nAlfred hesitated then looked towards his wife.",
    "She said clearly \u2018Mr Farr turned up quite\nunexpectedly yesterday.",
    "He happened to be in the neighbourhood and came to call upon\nmy father\u2010in\u2010law.",
    "When my father\u2010in\u2010law found he was the son of his old friend and\npartner he insisted on his remaining with us for Christmas.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018I see.",
    "That explains the household.",
    "As regards the servants Mrs\nLee do you consider them all trustworthy\u2019\nLydia considered for a moment before replying.",
    "Then she said \u2018Yes.",
    "I am quite sure they\nare all thoroughly reliable.",
    "They have mostly been with us for many years.",
    "Tressilian the\n69\n\n\fbutler has been here since my husband was a young child.",
    "The only newcomers are the\nbetween\u2010maid Joan and the nurse\u2010valet who attended on my father\u2010in\u2010law.\u2019\n\u2018What about them\u2019\n\u2018Joan is rather a silly little thing.",
    "That is the worst that can be said of her.",
    "I know very little\nabout Horbury.",
    "He has been here just over a year.",
    "He was quite competent at his job and\nmy father\u2010in\u2010law seemed satisfied with him.\u2019\nPoirot said acutely \u2018But you madame were not so satisfied\u2019\nLydia shrugged her shoulders slightly.",
    "\u2018It was nothing to do with me.\u2019\n\u2018But you are the mistress of the house madame.",
    "The servants are your concern\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes of course.",
    "But Horbury was my father\u2010in\u2010law\u2019s personal attendant.",
    "He did not\ncome under my jurisdiction.\u2019\n\u2018I see.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018We come now to the events of tonight.",
    "I\u2019m afraid this will be\npainful for you Mr Lee but I would like your account of what happened.\u2019\nAlfred said in a low voice \u2018Of course.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said prompting him \u2018When for instance did you last see your father\u2019\nA slight spasm of pain crossed Alfred\u2019s face as he replied in a low voice \u2018It was after tea.",
    "I\nwas with him for a short time.",
    "Finally I said goodnight to him and left him at\u2014let me see\u2014\nabout a quarter to six.\u2019\nPoirot observed \u2018You said goodnight to him You did not then expect to see him again\nthat evening\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "My father\u2019s supper a light meal was always brought to him at seven.",
    "After that he\nsometimes went to bed early or sometimes sat up in his chair but he did not expect to see\nany members of the family again unless he specially sent for them.\u2019\n\u2018Did he often send for them\u2019\n\u2018Sometimes.",
    "If he felt like it.\u2019\n\u2018But it was not the ordinary procedure\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\n70\n\n\f\u2018Go on please Mr Lee.\u2019\nAlfred continued \u2018We had our dinner at eight o\u2019clock.",
    "Dinner was over and my wife and\nthe other ladies had gone into the drawing\u2010room.\u2019 His voice faltered.",
    "His eyes began to\nstare again.",
    "\u2018We were sitting there\u2014at the table...",
    "Suddenly there was the most\nastounding noise overheard.",
    "Chairs overturning furniture crashing breaking glass and\nchina and then\u2014Oh God\u2019\u2014he shuddered\u2014\u2018I can hear it still\u2014my father screamed\u2014a\nhorrible long\u2010drawn scream\u2014the scream of a man in mortal agony...\u2019\nHe raised shaking hands to cover his face.",
    "Lydia stretched out her hand and touched his\nsleeve.",
    "Colonel Johnson said gently \u2018And then\u2019\nAlfred said in a broken voice \u2018I think\u2014just for a moment we were stunned.",
    "Then we\nsprang up and went out of the door and up the stairs to my father\u2019s room.",
    "The door was\nlocked.",
    "We couldn\u2019t get in.",
    "It had to be broken open.",
    "Then when we did get in we saw\u2014\u2019\nHis voice died away.",
    "Johnson said quickly \u2018There\u2019s no need to go into that part of it Mr Lee.",
    "To go back a little\nto the time you were in the dining\u2010room.",
    "Who was there with you when you heard the\ncry\u2019\n\u2018Who was there Why we were all\u2014No let me see.",
    "My brother was there\u2014my brother\nHarry.\u2019\n\u2018Nobody else\u2019\n\u2018No one else.\u2019\n\u2018Where were the other gentlemen\u2019\nAlfred sighed and frowned in an effort of remembrance.",
    "\u2018Let me see\u2014it seems so long ago\u2014yes like years\u2014what did happen Oh of course\nGeorge had gone to telephone.",
    "Then we began to talk of family matters and Stephen Farr\nsaid something about seeing we wanted to discuss things and he took himself off.",
    "He did\nit very nicely and tactfully.\u2019\n\u2018And your brother David\u2019\nAlfred frowned.",
    "\u2018David Wasn\u2019t he there No of course he wasn\u2019t.",
    "I don\u2019t quite know when he slipped\naway.\u2019\nPoirot said gently \u2018So you had the family matters to discuss\u2019\n\u2018Er\u2014yes.\u2019\n71\n\n\f\u2018That is to say you had matters to discuss with one member of your family\u2019\nLydia said \u2018What do you mean M. Poirot\u2019\nHe turned quickly to her.",
    "\u2018Madame your husband says that Mr Farr left them because he saw they had affairs of the\nfamily to discuss.",
    "But it was not a conseil de famille since M. David was not there and M.\nGeorge was not there.",
    "It was then a discussion between two members of the family\nonly.\u2019\nLydia said \u2018My brother\u2010in\u2010law Harry had been abroad for a great number of years.",
    "It was\nnatural that he and my husband should have things to talk over.\u2019\n\u2018Ah I see.",
    "It was like that.\u2019\nShe shot him a quick glance then turned her eyes away.",
    "Johnson said \u2018Well that seems clear enough.",
    "Did you notice anyone else as you ran\nupstairs to your father\u2019s room\u2019\n\u2018I\u2014really I don\u2019t know.",
    "I think so.",
    "We all came from different directions.",
    "But I\u2019m afraid I\ndidn\u2019t notice\u2014I was so alarmed.",
    "That terrible cry...\u2019\nColonel Johnson passed quickly to another subject.",
    "\u2018Thank you Mr Lee.",
    "Now there is another point.",
    "I understand that your father had some\nvaluable diamonds in his possession.\u2019\nAlfred looked rather surprised.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018That is so.\u2019\n\u2018Where did he keep them\u2019\n\u2018In the safe in his room.\u2019\n\u2018Can you describe them at all\u2019\n\u2018They were rough diamonds\u2014that is uncut stones.\u2019\n\u2018Why did your father have them there\u2019\n\u2018It was a whim of his.",
    "They were stones he had brought with him from South Africa.",
    "He\nnever had them cut.",
    "He just liked keeping them in his possession.",
    "As I say it was a whim of\nhis.\u2019\n\u2018I see\u2019 said the chief constable.",
    "72\n\n\fFrom his tone it was plain that he did not see.",
    "He went on \u2018Were they of much value\u2019\n\u2018My father estimated their value at about ten thousand pounds.\u2019\n\u2018In fact they were very valuable stones\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018It seems a curious idea to keep such stones in a bedroom safe.\u2019\nLydia interposed.",
    "\u2018My father\u2010in\u2010law Colonel Johnson was a somewhat curious man.",
    "His ideas were not the\nconventional ones.",
    "It definitely gave him pleasure to handle those stones.\u2019\n\u2018They recalled perhaps the past to him\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "She gave him a quick appreciative look.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I think they did.\u2019\nWere they insured\u2019 asked the chief constable.",
    "\u2018I think not.\u2019\nJohnson leaned forward.",
    "He asked quietly \u2018Did you know Mr Lee that those stones had\nbeen stolen\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019 Alfred Lee stared at him.",
    "\u2018Your father said nothing to you of their disappearance\u2019\n\u2018Not a word.\u2019\n\u2018You did not know that he had sent for Superintendent Sugden here and had reported the\nloss to him\u2019\n\u2018I hadn\u2019t the faintest idea of such a thing\u2019\nThe chief constable transferred his gaze.",
    "\u2018What about you Mrs Lee\u2019\nLydia shook her head.",
    "\u2018I heard nothing about it.\u2019\n\u2018As far as you knew the stones were still in the safe\u2019\n73\n\n\f\u2018Yes.\u2019\nShe hesitated and then asked \u2018Is that why he was killed For the sake of those stones\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018That is what we are going to find out\u2019\nHe went on \u2018Have you any idea Mrs Lee who could have engineered such a theft\u2019\nShe shook her head.",
    "\u2018No indeed.",
    "I am sure the servants are all honest.",
    "In any case it would be very difficult for\nthem to get at the safe.",
    "My father\u2010in\u2010law was always in his room.",

    "And then he told Alfred he was looking very glum.",
    "I think that\nwas because of Harry coming home to live.",
    "Alfred was very upset about that I believe.",
    "You\nsee Harry did something quite dreadful.",
    "And then he said something about his wife\u2014\nshe\u2019s dead long ago\u2014but she had the brains of a louse he said and David sprang up and\nlooked as though he\u2019d like to murder him\u2014Oh\u2019 She stopped suddenly her eyes alarmed.",

    "Mr Lee said he\ndidn\u2019t want to see anyone again that evening.",

    "In this room\u2019\n\u2018Yes that\u2019s the only telephone except the one upstairs in my father\u2010in\u2010law\u2019s room.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said \u2018Was anybody else in the room with you\u2019\nHer eyes widened.",

    "\u2018Real diamonds\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Diamonds worth about ten thousand pounds.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 It was a soft gasping sound\u2014holding in it the essence of feminine cupidity.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 said Colonel Johnson \u2018I think that\u2019s all for the present.",
    "We needn\u2019t bother you any\nfurther Mrs Lee.\u2019\n\u2018Oh thank you.\u2019\nShe stood up\u2014smiled from Johnson to Poirot\u2014the smile of a grateful little girl then she\nwent out walking with her head held high and her palms a little turned outwards.",

    "He answered \u2018I would say that the character of\nthe late Mr Simeon Lee begins to emerge for us.",
    "It is there I think that the whole\nimportance of the case lies... in the character of the dead man.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden turned a puzzled face to him.",

    "A more suspicious woman would have seen Iago\u2019s machinations and circumvented\nthem much earlier.",
    "The uncleanness of Marat directly invited his end in a bath.",

    "\u2018What exactly are you getting at Poirot\u2019\n\u2018I am telling you that because Simeon Lee was a certain kind of man he set in motion\ncertain forces which forces in the end brought about his death.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t think the diamonds had anything to do with it then\u2019\nPoirot smiled at the honest perplexity in Johnson\u2019s face.",
    "85\n\n\f\u2018Mon cher\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018It was because of Simeon Lee\u2019s peculiar character that he kept ten\nthousand pounds worth of uncut diamonds in his safe You have not there the action of\nevery man.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s very true Mr Poirot\u2019 said Superintendent Sugden nodding his head with the air of\na man who at last sees what a fellow\u2010conversationalist is driving at.",
    "\u2018He was a queer one\nMr Lee was.",
    "He kept those stones there so he could take them out and handle them and\nget the feeling of the past back.",
    "Depend upon it that\u2019s why he never had them cut.\u2019\nPoirot nodded energetically.",
    "\u2018Precisely\u2014precisely.",

    "Both those statements I think were true.",
    "But from them\nwe can draw our own reconstruction.",
    "What did Simeon Lee assemble his family for Why\nshould they have arrived in time to hear him telephoning to his lawyer Parbleu it was no\nerror that.",
    "He wanted them to hear it The poor old one he sits in his chair and he has\nlost the diversions of his younger days.",
    "So he invents a new diversion for himself.",
    "He\namuses himself by playing upon the cupidity and the greed of human nature\u2014yes and on\nits emotions and its passions too But from that arises one further deduction.",
    "In his game\nof rousing the greed and emotion of his children he would not omit anyone.",
    "He must\nlogically and necessarily have had his dig at Mr George Lee as well as at the others His\nwife is carefully silent about that.",
    "At her too he may have shot a poisoned arrow or two.",

    "The door opened and David Lee came in.",
    "XII\nDavid Lee had himself well in hand.",

    "He\ncame up to them drew a chair forward and sat down looking with grave interrogation at\nColonel Johnson.",
    "The electric light touched the fair peak of hair that grew on his forehead and showed up\nthe sensitive modelling of the cheek bones.",
    "He looked absurdly young to be the son of\nthat shrivelled old man who lay dead upstairs.",
    "\u2018Yes gentlemen\u2019 he said \u2018what can I tell you\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018I understand Mr Lee that there was a kind of family meeting held\nin your father\u2019s room this afternoon\u2019\n86\n\n\f\u2018There was.",
    "But it was quite informal.",
    "I mean it was not a family council or anything of\nthat kind.\u2019\n\u2018What took place there\u2019\nDavid Lee answered calmly \u2018My father was in a difficult mood.",
    "He was an old man and an\ninvalid of course one had to make allowances for him.",
    "He seemed to have assembled us\nthere in order to\u2014well\u2014vent his spite upon us.\u2019\n\u2018Can you remember what he said\u2019\nDavid said quietly \u2018It was really all rather foolish.",
    "He said we were no use\u2014any of us\u2014\nthat there wasn\u2019t a single man in the family He said Pilar that is my Spanish niece was\nworth two of any of us.",
    "He said\u2014\u2019 David stopped.",
    "Poirot said \u2018Please Mr Lee the exact words if you can.\u2019\nDavid said reluctantly \u2018He spoke rather coarsely\u2014said he hoped that somewhere in the\nworld he had better sons\u2014even if they were born the wrong side of the blanket...\u2019\nHis sensitive face showed distaste for the words he was repeating.",
    "Superintendent Sugden\nlooked up suddenly alert.",
    "Leaning forward he said \u2018Did your father say anything in\nparticular to your brother Mr George Lee\u2019\n\u2018To George I don\u2019t remember.",
    "Oh yes I believe he told him he would have to cut down\nexpenses in future he\u2019d have to reduce his allowance.",
    "George was very upset got as red\nas a turkey cock.",
    "He spluttered and said he couldn\u2019t possibly manage with less.",
    "My father\nsaid quite coolly that he\u2019d have to.",
    "He said he\u2019d better get his wife to help him economize.",
    "Rather a nasty dig that\u2014George has always been the economical one\u2014saves and stints\non every penny.",
    "Magdalene I fancy is a bit of a spender\u2014she has extravagant tastes.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018So that she too was annoyed\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Besides my father worded something else rather crudely\u2014mentioned her as having\nlived with a naval officer.",
    "Of course he really meant her father but it sounded rather\ndubious.",
    "Magdalene went scarlet.",
    "I don\u2019t blame her.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Did your father mention his late wife your mother\u2019\nThe red blood ran in waves up David\u2019s temples.",
    "His hands clenched themselves on the\ntable in front of him trembling slightly.",
    "He said in a low choked voice \u2018Yes he did.",
    "He insulted her.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018What did he say\u2019\nDavid said abruptly \u2018I don\u2019t remember.",
    "Just some slighting reference.\u2019\n87\n\n\fPoirot said softly \u2018Your mother has been dead some years\u2019\nDavid said shortly \u2018She died when I was a boy.\u2019\n\u2018She was not\u2014perhaps\u2014very happy in her life here\u2019\nDavid gave a scornful laugh \u2018Who could be happy with a man like my father My mother\nwas a saint.",
    "She died a broken\u2010hearted woman.\u2019\nPoirot went on \u2018Your father was perhaps distressed by her death\u2019\nDavid said abruptly \u2018I don\u2019t know.",
    "I left home.\u2019\nHe paused and then said \u2018Perhaps you may not be aware of the fact that when I came on\nthis visit I had not seen my father for nearly twenty years.",
    "So you see I can\u2019t tell you very\nmuch about his habits or his enemies or what went on here.\u2019\nColonel Johnson asked \u2018Did you know that your father kept a lot of valuable diamonds in\nthe safe in his bedroom\u2019\nDavid said indifferently \u2018Did he Seems a foolish sort of thing to do.\u2019\nJohnson said \u2018Will you describe briefly your own movements last night\u2019\n\u2018Mine Oh I went away from the dinner\u2010table fairly quickly.",
    "It bores me this sitting round\nover port.",
    "Besides I could see that Alfred and Harry were working up for a quarrel.",
    "I hate\nrows.",
    "I slipped away and went to the music\u2010room and played the piano.\u2019\nPoirot asked \u2018The music\u2010room it is next to the drawing\u2010room is it not\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "I played there for some time\u2014till\u2014till the thing happened.\u2019\n\u2018What did you hear exactly\u2019\n\u2018Oh A far\u2010off noise of furniture being overturned somewhere upstairs.",
    "And then a pretty\nghastly cry.\u2019 He clenched his hands again.",
    "\u2018Like a soul in hell.",
    "God it was awful\u2019\nJohnson said \u2018Were you alone in the music\u2010room\u2019\n\u2018Eh No my wife Hilda was there.",
    "She\u2019d come in from the drawing\u2010room.",
    "We\u2014we went\nup with the others.\u2019\nHe added quickly and nervously \u2018You don\u2019t want me do you to describe what\u2014what I\nsaw there\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018No quite unnecessary.",
    "Thank you Mr Lee there\u2019s nothing more.",
    "You can\u2019t imagine I suppose who would be likely to want to murder your father\u2019\n88\n\n\fDavid Lee said recklessly \u2018I should think\u2014quite a lot of people I don\u2019t know of anyone\ndefinite.\u2019\nHe went out rapidly shutting the door loudly behind him.",
    "XIII\nColonel Johnson had had no time to do more than clear his throat when the door opened\nagain and Hilda Lee came in.",
    "Hercule Poirot looked at her with interest.",
    "He had to admit to himself that the wives these\nLees had married were an interesting study.",
    "The swift intelligence and greyhound grace of\nLydia the meretricious airs and graces of Magdalene and now the solid comfortable\nstrength of Hilda.",
    "She was he saw younger than her rather dowdy style of hair\u2010dressing\nand unfashionable clothes made her appear.",
    "Her mouse\u2010brown hair was unflecked with\ngrey and her steady hazel eyes set in the rather podgy face shone out like beacons of\nkindliness.",
    "She was he thought a nice woman.",
    "Colonel Johnson was talking in his kindliest tone.",
    "\u2018... A great strain on all of you\u2019 he was saying.",
    "\u2018I gather from your husband Mrs Lee that\nthis is the first time you have been to Gorston Hall\u2019\nShe bowed her head.",
    "\u2018Were you previously acquainted with your father\u2010in\u2010law Mr Lee\u2019\nHilda replied in her pleasant voice \u2018No.",
    "We were married soon after David left home.",
    "He\nalways wanted to have nothing to do with his family.",
    "Until now we have not seen any of\nthem.\u2019\n\u2018How then did this visit come about\u2019\n\u2018My father\u2010in\u2010law wrote to David.",
    "He stressed his age and his desire that all his children\nshould be with him this Christmas.\u2019\n\u2018And your husband responded to this appeal\u2019\nHilda said \u2018His acceptance was I am afraid all my doing\u2014I misunderstood the situation.\u2019\nPoirot interposed.",
    "He said \u2018Will you be so kind as to explain yourself a little more clearly madame I think\nwhat you can tell us may be of value.\u2019\nShe turned to him immediately.",
    "89\n\n\fShe said \u2018At that time I had never seen my father\u2010in\u2010law.",
    "I had no idea what his real\nmotive was.",
    "I assumed that he was old and lonely and that he really wanted to be\nreconciled to all his children.\u2019\n\u2018And what was his real motive in your opinion madame\u2019\nHilda hesitated a moment.",
    "Then she said slowly \u2018I have no doubt\u2014no doubt at all\u2014that\nwhat my father\u2010in\u2010law really wanted was not to promote peace but to stir up strife.\u2019\n\u2018In what way\u2019\nHilda said in a low voice \u2018It amused him to\u2014to appeal to the worst instincts in human\nnature.",
    "There was\u2014how can I put it\u2014a kind of diabolical impishness about him.",
    "He\nwished to set every member of the family at loggerheads with one another.\u2019\nJohnson said sharply \u2018And did he succeed\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes\u2019 said Hilda Lee.",
    "\u2018He succeeded.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018We have been told madame of a scene that took place this afternoon.",
    "It was\nI think rather a violent scene.\u2019\nShe bowed her head.",
    "\u2018Will you describe it to us\u2014as truthfully as possible if you please.\u2019\nShe reflected a minute.",
    "\u2018When we went in my father\u2010in\u2010law was telephoning.\u2019\n\u2018To his lawyer I understand\u2019\n\u2018Yes he was suggesting that Mr\u2014was it Charlton\u2014I don\u2019t quite remember the name\u2014\nshould come over as he my father\u2010in\u2010law wanted to make a new will.",
    "His old one he said\nwas quite out of date.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Think carefully madame in your opinion did your father\u2010in\u2010law deliberately\nensure that you should all overhear this conversation or was it just by chance that you\noverheard it\u2019\nHilda Lee said \u2018I am almost sure that he meant us to overhear.\u2019\n\u2018With the object of fomenting doubt and suspicions among you\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018So that really he may not have meant to alter his will at all\u2019\n90\n\n\fShe demurred.",
    "\u2018No I think that part of it was quite genuine.",
    "He probably did wish to make a new will\u2014\nbut he enjoyed underlining the fact.\u2019\n\u2018Madame\u2019 said Poirot \u2018I have no official standing and my questions you understand are\nnot perhaps those that an English officer of the law would ask.",
    "But I have a great desire to\nknow what form you think that new will would have taken.",
    "I am asking you perceive not\nfor your knowledge but simply for your opinion.",
    "Les femmes they are never slow to form\nan opinion Dieu merci.\u2019\nHilda Lee smiled a little.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t mind saying what I think.",
    "My husband\u2019s sister Jennifer married a Spaniard Juan\nEstravados.",
    "Her daughter Pilar has just arrived here.",
    "She is a very lovely girl\u2014and she is\nof course the only grandchild in the family.",
    "Old Mr Lee was delighted with her.",
    "He took a\ntremendous fancy to her.",
    "In my opinion he wished to leave her a considerable sum in his\nnew will.",
    "Probably he had only left her a small portion or even nothing at all in an old one.\u2019\n\u2018Did you know your sister\u2010in\u2010law at all\u2019\n\u2018No I never met her.",
    "Her Spanish husband died in tragic circumstances I believe soon\nafter the marriage.",
    "Jennifer herself died a year ago.",
    "Pilar was left an orphan.",
    "This is why\nMr Lee sent for her to come and live with him in England.\u2019\n\u2018And the other members of the family did they welcome her coming\u2019\nHilda said quietly \u2018I think they all liked her.",
    "It was very pleasant to have someone young\nand alive in the house.\u2019\n\u2018And she did she seem to like being here\u2019\nHilda said slowly \u2018I don\u2019t know.",
    "It must seem cold and strange to a girl brought up in the\nSouth\u2014in Spain.\u2019\nJohnson said \u2018Can\u2019t be very pleasant being in Spain just at present.",
    "Now Mrs Lee we\u2019d\nlike to hear your account of the conversation this afternoon.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018I apologize.",
    "I have made the digressions.\u2019\nHilda Lee said \u2018After my father\u2010in\u2010law finished telephoning he looked round at us and\nlaughed and said we all looked very glum.",
    "Then he said he was tired and should go to bed\nearly.",
    "Nobody was to come up and see him this evening.",
    "He said he wanted to be in good\nform for Christmas Day.",
    "Something like that.\u2019\n\u2018Then\u2014\u2019 Her brows knit in an effort of remembrance.",
    "\u2018I think he said something about its\nbeing necessary to be one of a large family to appreciate Christmas and then he went on\nto speak of money.",
    "He said it would cost him more to run this house in future.",
    "He told\n91\n\n\fGeorge and Magdalene they would have to economize.",
    "Told her she ought to make her\nown clothes.",
    "Rather an old\u2010fashioned idea I\u2019m afraid.",
    "I don\u2019t wonder it annoyed her.",
    "He\nsaid his own wife had been clever with her needle.\u2019\nPoirot said gently \u2018Is that all that he said about her\u2019\nHilda flushed.",
    "\u2018He made a slighting reference to her brains.",
    "My husband was very devoted to his mother\nand that upset him very much.",
    "And then suddenly Mr Lee began shouting at us all.",
    "He\nworked himself up about it.",
    "I can understand of course how he felt\u2014\u2019\nPoirot said gently interrupting her \u2018How did he feel\u2019\nShe turned her tranquil eyes upon him.",
    "\u2018He was disappointed of course\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Because there are no grandchildren\u2014no boys\nI mean\u2014no Lees to carry on.",
    "I can see that that must have festered for a long time.",
    "And\nsuddenly he couldn\u2019t keep it in any longer and vented his rage against his sons\u2014saying\nthey were a lot of namby\u2010pamby old women\u2014something like that.",
    "I felt sorry for him\nthen because I realized how his pride was hurt by it.\u2019\n\u2018And then\u2019\n\u2018And then\u2019 said Hilda slowly \u2018we all went away.\u2019\n\u2018That was the last you saw of him\u2019\nShe bowed her head.",
    "\u2018Where were you at the time the crime occurred\u2019\n\u2018I was with my husband in the music\u2010room.",
    "He was playing to me.\u2019\n\u2018And then\u2019\n\u2018We heard tables and chairs overturned upstairs and china being broken\u2014some terrible\nstruggle.",
    "And then that awful scream as his throat was cut...\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Was it such an awful scream Was it\u2019\u2014he paused\u2014\u2018like a soul in hell\u2019\nHilda Lee said \u2018It was worse than that\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean madame\u2019\n\u2018It was like someone who had no soul...",
    "It was inhuman like a beast...\u2019\nPoirot said gravely \u2018So\u2014you have judged him madame\u2019\n92\n\n\fShe raised a hand in sudden distress.",
    "Her eyes fell and she stared down at the floor.",
    "XIV\nPilar came into the room with the wariness of an animal who suspects a trap.",
    "Her eyes\nwent quickly from side to side.",
    "She looked not so much afraid as deeply suspicious.",
    "Colonel Johnson rose and put a chair for her.",
    "Then he said \u2018You understand English I\nsuppose Miss Estravados\u2019\nPilar\u2019s eyes opened wide.",
    "She said \u2018Of course.",
    "My mother was English.",
    "I am really very\nEnglish indeed.\u2019\nA faint smile came to Colonel Johnson\u2019s lips as his eyes took in the black gloss of her hair\nthe proud dark eyes and the curling red lips.",
    "Very English An incongruous term to apply\nto Pilar Estravados.",
    "He said \u2018Mr Lee was your grandfather.",
    "He sent for you to come from Spain.",
    "And you\narrived a few days ago.",
    "Is that right\u2019\nPilar nodded.",
    "\u2018That is right.",
    "I had\u2014oh A lot of adventures getting out of Spain\u2014there was a bomb from\nthe air and the chauffeur he was killed\u2014where his head had been there was all blood.",
    "And\nI could not drive a car so for a long way I had to walk\u2014and I do not like walking.",
    "I never\nwalk.",
    "My feet were sore\u2014but sore\u2014\u2019\nColonel Johnson smiled.",
    "He said \u2018At any rate you arrived here.",
    "Had your mother spoken to\nyou of your grandfather much\u2019\nPilar nodded cheerfully.",
    "\u2018Oh yes she said he was an old devil.\u2019\nHercule Poirot smiled.",
    "He said \u2018And what did you think of him when you arrived\nmademoiselle\u2019\nPilar said \u2018Of course he was very very old.",
    "He had to sit in a chair\u2014and his face was all\ndried up.",
    "But I liked him all the same.",
    "I think that when he was a young man he must have\nbeen handsome\u2014very handsome like you\u2019 said Pilar to Superintendent Sugden.",
    "Her eyes\ndwelt with na\u00efve pleasure on his handsome face which had turned brick\u2010red at the\ncompliment.",
    "Colonel Johnson stifled a chuckle.",
    "It was one of the few occasions when he had seen the\nstolid superintendent taken aback.",
    "\u2018But of course\u2019 Pilar continued regretfully \u2018he could never have been so big as you.\u2019\n93\n\n\fHercule Poirot sighed.",
    "\u2018You like then big men se\u00f1orita\u2019 he inquired.",
    "Pilar agreed enthusiastically.",
    "\u2018Oh yes I like a man to be very big tall and the shoulders broad and very very strong.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said sharply \u2018Did you see much of your grandfather when you arrived\nhere\u2019\nPilar said \u2018Oh yes.",
    "I went to sit with him.",
    "He told me things\u2014that he had been a very\nwicked man and all the things he did in South Africa.\u2019\n\u2018Did he ever tell you that he had diamonds in the safe in his room\u2019\n\u2018Yes he showed them to me.",
    "But they were not like diamonds\u2014they were just like\npebbles\u2014very ugly\u2014very ugly indeed.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said shortly \u2018So he showed them to you did he\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018He didn\u2019t give you any of them\u2019\nPilar shook her head.",
    "\u2018No he did not.",
    "I thought that perhaps one day he would\u2014if I were very nice to him and\ncame often to sit with him.",
    "Because old gentlemen they like very much young girls.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018Do you know that those diamonds have been stolen\u2019\nPilar opened her eyes very wide.",
    "\u2018Stolen\u2019\n\u2018Yes have you any idea who might have taken them\u2019\nPilar nodded her head.",
    "\u2018Oh yes\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018It would be Horbury.\u2019\n\u2018Horbury You mean the valet\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Why do you think that\u2019\n94\n\n\f\u2018Because he has the face of a thief.",
    "His eyes go so from side to side he walks softly and\nlistens at doors.",
    "He is like a cat.",
    "And all cats are thieves.\u2019\n\u2018H\u2019m\u2019 said Colonel Johnson.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ll leave it at that.",
    "Now I understand that all the family\nwere up in your grandfather\u2019s room this afternoon and that some\u2014er\u2014angry words\npassed.\u2019\nPilar nodded and smiled.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018It was great fun.",
    "Grandfather made them oh So angry\u2019\n\u2018Oh you enjoyed it did you\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "I like to see people get angry.",
    "I like it very much.",
    "But here in England they do not get\nangry like they do in Spain.",
    "In Spain they take out their knives and they curse and shout.",
    "In\nEngland they do nothing just get very red in the face and shut up their mouths tight.\u2019\n\u2018Do you remember what was said\u2019\nPilar seemed rather doubtful.",
    "\u2018I am not sure.",
    "Grandfather said they were no good\u2014that they had not got any children.",
    "He said I was better than any of them.",
    "He liked me very much.\u2019\n\u2018Did he say anything about money or a will\u2019\n\u2018A will\u2014no I don\u2019t think so.",
    "I don\u2019t remember.\u2019\n\u2018What happened\u2019\n\u2018They all went away\u2014except Hilda\u2014the fat one David\u2019s wife she stayed behind.\u2019\n\u2018Oh she did did she\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "David looked very funny.",
    "He was all shaking and oh So white.",
    "He looked as though\nhe might be sick.\u2019\n\u2018And what then\u2019\n\u2018Then I went and found Stephen.",
    "We danced to the gramophone.\u2019\n\u2018Stephen Farr\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "He is from South Africa\u2014he is the son of Grandfather\u2019s partner.",
    "He is very handsome\ntoo.",
    "Very brown and big and he has nice eyes.\u2019\nJohnson asked \u2018Where were you when the crime occurred\u2019\n95\n\n\f\u2018You ask where I was\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018I had gone into the drawing\u2010room with Lydia.",
    "And then I went up to my room and did my\nface.",
    "I was going to dance again with Stephen.",
    "And then far away I heard a scream and\neveryone was running so I went too.",
    "And they were trying to break down Grandfather\u2019s\ndoor.",
    "Harry did it with Stephen they are both big strong men.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018And then\u2014crash\u2014down it went\u2014and we all looked in.",
    "Oh such a sight\u2014everything\nsmashed and knocked over and Grandfather lying in a lot of blood and his throat was cut\nlike this\u2019\u2014she made a vivid dramatic gesture at her own neck\u2014\u2018right up under his ear.\u2019\nShe paused having obviously enjoyed her narrative.",
    "Johnson said \u2018The blood didn\u2019t make you feel ill\u2019\nShe stared.",
    "\u2018No why should it There is usually blood when people are killed.",
    "There was oh so much\nblood everywhere\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Did anyone say anything\u2019\nPilar said \u2018David said such a funny thing\u2014what was it Oh yes.",
    "The mills of God\u2014that is\nwhat he said\u2019\u2014she repeated it with emphasis on each word\u2014\u2018The mills\u2014of\u2014God\u2014What\ndoes that mean Mills are what make flour are they not\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018Well I don\u2019t think there is anything more just now Miss\nEstravados.\u2019\nPilar got up obediently.",
    "She flashed a quick charming smile at each man in turn.",
    "\u2018I will go now then.\u2019 She went out.",
    "Colonel Johnson said \u2018The mills of God grind slowly but they grind exceeding small.",
    "And\nDavid Lee said that\u2019\nXV\nAs the door opened once more Colonel Johnson looked up.",
    "For a moment he took the\nentering figure to be that of Harry Lee but as Stephen Farr advanced into the room he\nsaw his error.",
    "\u2018Sit down Mr Farr\u2019 he said.",
    "96\n\n\fStephen sat.",
    "His eyes cool intelligent eyes went from one to the other of the three men.",
    "He said \u2018I\u2019m afraid I shan\u2019t be much use to you.",
    "But please ask me anything that you think\nmay help.",
    "Perhaps I\u2019d better explain to start with who I am.",
    "My father Ebenezer Farr\nwas Simeon Lee\u2019s partner in South Africa in the old days.",
    "I\u2019m talking of over forty years\nago.\u2019\nHe paused.",
    "\u2018My dad talked to me a lot about Simeon Lee\u2014what a personality he was.",
    "He and Dad\ncleaned up a good bit together.",
    "Simeon Lee went home with a fortune and my father\ndidn\u2019t do badly either.",
    "My father always told me that when I came to this country I was to\nlook up Mr Lee.",
    "I said once that it was a long time ago and that he\u2019d probably not know\nwho I was but Dad scoffed at the idea.",
    "He said \u201cWhen two men have been through what\nSimeon and I went through they don\u2019t forget.\u201d Well my father died a couple of years ago.",
    "This year I came over to England for the first time and I thought I\u2019d act on Dad\u2019s advice\nand look up Mr Lee.\u2019\nWith a slight smile he went on \u2018I was just a little nervous when I came along here but I\nneedn\u2019t have been.",
    "Mr Lee gave me a warm welcome and absolutely insisted that I should\nstay with the family over Christmas.",
    "I was afraid I was butting in but he wouldn\u2019t hear of a\nrefusal.\u2019\nHe added rather shyly \u2018They were all very nice to me\u2014Mr and Mrs Alfred Lee couldn\u2019t\nhave been nicer.",
    "I\u2019m terribly sorry for them that all this should come upon them.\u2019\n\u2018How long have you been here Mr Farr\u2019\n\u2018Since yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018Did you see Mr Lee today at all\u2019\n\u2018Yes I had a chat with him this morning.",
    "He was in good spirits then and anxious to hear\nabout a lot of people and places.\u2019\n\u2018That was the last time you saw him\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Did he mention to you that he kept a quantity of uncut diamonds in his safe\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\nHe added before the other could speak \u2018Do you mean that this business was murder and\nrobbery\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019re not sure yet\u2019 said Johnson.",
    "\u2018Now to come to the events of this evening will you tell\nme in your own words what you were doing\u2019\n97\n\n\f\u2018Certainly.",
    "After the ladies left the dining\u2010room I stayed and had a glass of port.",
    "Then I\nrealized that the Lees had family business they wanted to discuss and that my being there\nwas hampering them so I excused myself and left them.\u2019\n\u2018And what did you do then\u2019\nStephen Farr leaned back in his chair.",
    "His forefinger caressed his jaw.",
    "He said rather\nwoodenly \u2018I\u2014er\u2014went along to a big room with a parquet floor\u2014a kind of ballroom I\nfancy.",
    "There\u2019s a gramophone there and dance records.",
    "I put some records on.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018It was possible perhaps that someone might join you there\u2019\nA very faint smile curved Stephen Farr\u2019s lips.",
    "He answered \u2018It was possible yes.",
    "One\nalways hopes.\u2019\nAnd he grinned outright.",
    "Poirot said \u2018Se\u00f1orita Estravados is very beautiful.\u2019\nStephen answered \u2018She\u2019s easily the best thing to look at that I\u2019ve seen since I came to\nEngland.\u2019\n\u2018Did Miss Estravados join you\u2019 asked Colonel Johnson.",
    "Stephen shook his head.",
    "\u2018I was still there when I heard the rumpus.",
    "I came out into the hall and ran hell for leather\nto see what was the matter.",
    "I helped Harry Lee to break the door down.\u2019\n\u2018And that\u2019s all you have to tell us\u2019\n\u2018Absolutely all I\u2019m afraid.\u2019\nHercule Poirot leaned forward.",
    "He said softly \u2018But I think Monsieur Farr that you could\ntell us a good deal if you liked.\u2019\nFarr said sharply \u2018What d\u2019you mean\u2019\n\u2018You can tell us something that is very important in this case\u2014the character of Mr Lee.",
    "You\nsay that your father talked much of him to you.",
    "What manner of a man was it that he\ndescribed to you\u2019\nStephen Farr said slowly \u2018I think I see what you\u2019re driving at.",
    "What was Simeon Lee like in\nhis young days Well\u2014you want me to be frank I suppose\u2019\n\u2018If you please.\u2019\n\n98\n\n\f\u2018Well to begin with I don\u2019t think that Simeon Lee was a highly moral member of society.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t mean that he was exactly a crook but he sailed pretty near the wind.",
    "His morals\nwere nothing to boast about anyway.",
    "He had charm though a good deal of it.",
    "And he was\nfantastically generous.",
    "No one with a hard\u2010luck story ever appealed to him in vain.",
    "He\ndrank a bit but not over\u2010much was attractive to women and had a sense of humour.",
    "All\nthe same he had a queer revengeful streak in him.",
    "Talk of the elephant never forgets and\nyou talk of Simeon Lee.",
    "My father told me of several cases where Lee waited years to get\neven with someone who\u2019d done him a nasty turn.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said \u2018Two might play at that game.",
    "You\u2019ve no knowledge I\nsuppose Mr Farr of anyone who Simeon Lee had done a bad turn to out there Nothing\nout of the past that could explain the crime committed here this evening\u2019\nStephen Farr shook his head.",
    "\u2018He had enemies of course must have had being the man he was.",
    "But I know of no\nspecific case.",
    "Besides\u2019 his eyes narrowed \u2018I understand as a matter of fact I\u2019ve been\nquestioning Tressilian there have been no strangers in or near the house this evening.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018With the exception of yourself M. Farr.\u2019\nStephen Farr swung round upon him.",
    "\u2018Oh so that\u2019s it Suspicious stranger within the gates Well you won\u2019t find anything of\nthat kind.",
    "No back history of Simeon Lee doing Ebenezer Farr down and Eb\u2019s son coming\nover to revenge his dad No\u2019 he shook his head.",
    "\u2018Simeon and Ebenezer had nothing\nagainst each other.",
    "I came here as I\u2019ve told you out of sheer curiosity.",
    "And moreover I\nshould imagine a gramophone is as good an alibi as anything else.",
    "I never stopped putting\non records\u2014somebody must have heard them.",
    "One record wouldn\u2019t give me time to race\naway upstairs\u2014these passages are a mile long anyway\u2014slit an old man\u2019s throat wash off\nthe blood and get back again before the others came rushing up.",
    "The idea\u2019s farcical\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018We\u2019re not making any insinuations against you Mr Farr.\u2019\nStephen Farr said \u2018I didn\u2019t care much for the tone of Mr Hercule Poirot\u2019s voice.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019 said Hercule Poirot \u2018is unfortunate\u2019\nHe smiled benignly at the other.",
    "Stephen Farr looked angrily at him.",
    "Colonel Johnson interposed quickly \u2018Thank you Mr Farr.",
    "That will be all for the present.",
    "You will of course not leave this house.\u2019\nStephen Farr nodded.",
    "He got up and left the room walking with a freely swinging stride.",
    "99\n\n\fAs the door closed behind him Johnson said \u2018There goes X the unknown quantity.",
    "His\nstory seems straightforward enough.",
    "All the same he\u2019s the dark horse.",
    "He might have\npinched those diamonds\u2014might have come here with a bogus story just to gain\nadmittance.",
    "You\u2019d better get his fingerprints Sugden and see if he\u2019s known.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve already got them\u2019 said the superintendent with a dry smile.",
    "\u2018Good man.",
    "You don\u2019t overlook much.",
    "I suppose you\u2019re on to all the obvious lines\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden checked off on his fingers.",
    "\u2018Check up on those telephone calls\u2014times etc.",
    "Check up on Horbury.",
    "What time he left\nwho saw him go.",
    "Check up all entrances and exits.",
    "Check up on staff generally.",
    "Check up\nfinancial position of members of family.",
    "Get on to the lawyers and check up on will.",
    "Search\nhouse for the weapon and for bloodstains on clothing\u2014also possibly diamonds hidden\nsomewhere.\u2019\n\u2018That covers everything I think\u2019 said Colonel Johnson approvingly.",
    "\u2018Can you suggest\nanything M. Poirot\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018I find the superintendent admirably thorough.\u2019\nSugden said gloomily \u2018It won\u2019t be any joke looking through this house for the missing\ndiamonds.",
    "Never saw so many ornaments and knick\u2010knacks in my life.\u2019\n\u2018The hiding\u2010places are certainly abundant\u2019 Poirot agreed.",
    "\u2018And there\u2019s really nothing you would suggest Poirot\u2019\nThe chief constable looked a little disappointed\u2014rather like a man whose dog has refused\nto do its trick.",
    "Poirot said \u2018You will permit that I take a line of my own\u2019\n\u2018Certainly\u2014certainly\u2019 said Johnson at the same moment as Superintendent Sugden said\nrather suspiciously \u2018What line\u2019\n\u2018I would like\u2019 said Hercule Poirot \u2018to converse\u2014very often\u2014very frequently\u2014with\nmembers of the family.\u2019\n\u2018You mean you\u2019d like to have another shot at questioning them\u2019 asked the colonel a little\npuzzled.",
    "\u2018No no not to question\u2014to converse\u2019\n\u2018Why\u2019 asked Sugden.",
    "Hercule Poirot waved an emphatic hand.",
    "100\n\n\f\u2018In conversation points arise If a human being converses much it is impossible for him to\navoid the truth\u2019\nSugden said \u2018Then you think someone is lying\u2019\nPoirot sighed.",
    "\u2018Mon cher everyone lies\u2014in parts like the egg of the English curate.",
    "It is profitable to\nseparate the harmless lies from the vital ones.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said sharply \u2018All the same it\u2019s incredible you know.",
    "Here\u2019s a particularly\ncrude and brutal murder\u2014and whom have we as suspects Alfred Lee and his wife\u2014both\ncharming well\u2010bred quiet people.",
    "George Lee who\u2019s a Member of Parliament and the\nessence of respectability.",
    "His wife She\u2019s just an ordinary modern lovely.",
    "David Lee seems\na gentle creature and we\u2019ve got his brother Harry\u2019s word for it that he can\u2019t stand the\nsight of blood.",
    "His wife seems a nice sensible woman\u2014quite commonplace.",
    "Remains the\nSpanish niece and the man from South Africa.",
    "Spanish beauties have hot tempers but I\ndon\u2019t see that attractive creature slitting the old man\u2019s neck in cold blood especially as\nfrom what has come out she had every reason to keep him alive\u2014at any rate until he had\nsigned a new will.",
    "Stephen Farr\u2019s a possibility\u2014that is to say he may be a professional\ncrook and have come here after the diamonds.",
    "The old man discovered the loss and Farr\nslit his throat to keep him quiet.",
    "That could have been so\u2014that gramophone alibi isn\u2019t too\ngood.\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u2018My dear friend\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Compare the physique of M. Stephen Farr and old Simeon Lee.",
    "If\nFarr decided to kill the old man he could have done it in a minute\u2014Simeon Lee couldn\u2019t\npossibly have put up that fight against him.",
    "Can one believe that that frail old man and\nthat magnificent specimen of humanity struggled for some minutes overturning chairs and\nbreaking china To imagine such a thing is fantastic\u2019\nColonel Johnson\u2019s eyes narrowed.",
    "\u2018You mean\u2019 he said \u2018that it was a weak man who killed Simeon Lee\u2019\n\u2018Or a woman\u2019 said the superintendent.",
    "XVI\nColonel Johnson looked at his watch.",
    "\u2018Nothing much more that I can do here.",
    "You\u2019ve got things well in hand Sugden.",
    "Oh just\none thing.",
    "We ought to see the butler fellow.",
    "I know you\u2019ve questioned him but we know\na bit more about things now.",
    "It\u2019s important to get confirmation of just where everybody\nsays he was at the time of the murder.\u2019\nTressilian came in slowly.",
    "The chief constable told him to sit down.",
    "101\n\n\f\u2018Thank you sir.",
    "I will if you don\u2019t mind.",
    "I\u2019ve been feeling very queer\u2014very queer indeed.",
    "My legs sir and my head.\u2019\nPoirot said gently \u2018You have had the shock yes.\u2019\nThe butler shuddered.",
    "\u2018Such\u2014such a violent thing to happen.",
    "In this house Where\neverything has always gone on so quietly.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018It was a well\u2010ordered house yes But not a happy one\u2019\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t like to say that sir.\u2019\n\u2018In the old days when all the family was at home it was happy then\u2019\nTressilian said slowly \u2018It wasn\u2019t perhaps what one would call very harmonious sir.\u2019\n\u2018The late Mrs Lee was somewhat of an invalid was she not\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir very poorly she was.\u2019\n\u2018Were her children fond of her\u2019\n\u2018Mr David he was devoted to her.",
    "More like a daughter than a son.",
    "And after she died he\nbroke away couldn\u2019t face living here any longer.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018And Mr Harry What was he like\u2019\n\u2018Always rather a wild young gentleman sir but good\u2010hearted.",
    "Oh dear gave me quite a\nturn it did when the bell rang\u2014and then again so impatient like and I opened the door\nand there was a strange man and then Mr Harry\u2019s voice said \u201cHallo Tressilian.",
    "Still here\neh\u201d Just the same as ever.\u2019\nPoirot said sympathetically \u2018It must have been the strange feeling yes indeed.\u2019\nTressilian said a little pink flush showing in his cheek \u2018It seems sometimes sir as though\nthe past isn\u2019t the past I believe there\u2019s been a play on in London about something like\nthat.",
    "There\u2019s something in it sir\u2014there really is.",
    "There\u2019s a feeling comes over you\u2014as\nthough you\u2019d done everything before.",
    "It just seems to me as though the bell rings and I go\nto answer it and there\u2019s Mr Harry\u2014even if it should be Mr Farr or some other person\u2014I\u2019m\njust saying to myself\u2014but I\u2019ve done this before...\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018That is very interesting\u2014very interesting.\u2019\nTressilian looked at him gratefully.",
    "Johnson somewhat impatient cleared his throat and took charge of the conversation.",
    "102\n\n\f\u2018Just want to get various times checked correctly\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Now when the noise upstairs\nstarted I understand that only Mr Alfred Lee and Mr Harry Lee were in the dining\u2010room.",
    "Is\nthat so\u2019\n\u2018I really couldn\u2019t tell you sir.",
    "All the gentlemen were there when I served coffee to them\u2014\nbut that would be about a quarter of an hour earlier.\u2019\n\u2018Mr George Lee was telephoning.",
    "Can you confirm that\u2019\n\u2018I think somebody did telephone sir.",
    "The bell rings in my pantry and when anybody takes\noff the receiver to call a number there\u2019s just a faint noise on the bell.",
    "I do remember\nhearing that but I didn\u2019t pay attention to it.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t know exactly when it was\u2019\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t say sir.",
    "It was after I had taken coffee to the gentlemen that is all I can say.\u2019\n\u2018Do you know where any of the ladies were at the time I mentioned\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Alfred was in the drawing\u2010room sir when I went for the coffee tray.",
    "That was just a\nminute or two before I heard the cry upstairs.\u2019\nPoirot asked \u2018What was she doing\u2019\n\u2018She was standing by the far window sir.",
    "She was holding the curtain a little back and\nlooking out.\u2019\n\u2018And none of the other ladies were in the room\u2019\n\u2018No sir.\u2019\n\u2018Do you know where they were\u2019\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t say at all sir.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t know where anyone else was\u2019\n\u2018Mr David I think was playing in the music\u2010room next door to the drawing\u2010room.\u2019\n\u2018You heard him playing\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019 Again the old man shivered.",
    "\u2018It was like a sign sir so I felt afterwards.",
    "It was the\n\u201cDead March\u201d he was playing.",
    "Even at the time I remember it gave me the creeps.\u2019\n\u2018It is curious yes\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Now about this fellow Horbury the valet\u2019 said the chief constable.",
    "\u2018Are you definitely\nprepared to swear that he was out of the house by eight o\u2019clock\u2019\n103\n\n\f\u2018Oh yes sir.",
    "It was just after Mr Sugden here arrived.",
    "I remember particular because he\nbroke a coffee\u2010cup.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Horbury broke a coffee\u2010cup\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir\u2014one of the old Worcester ones.",
    "Eleven years I\u2019ve washed them up and never one\nbroken till this evening.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018What was Horbury doing with the coffee\u2010cups\u2019\n\u2018Well of course sir he\u2019d no business to have been handling them at all.",
    "He was just\nholding one up admiring it like and I happened to mention that Mr Sugden had called\nand he dropped it.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Did you say \u201cMr Sugden\u201d or did you mention the word police\u2019\nTressilian looked a little startled.",
    "\u2018Now I come to think of it sir I mentioned that the police superintendent had called.\u2019\n\u2018And Horbury dropped the coffee\u2010cup\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Seems suggestive that\u2019 said the chief constable.",
    "\u2018Did Horbury ask any questions about\nthe superintendent\u2019s visit\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir asked what he wanted here.",
    "I said he\u2019d come collecting for the Police Orphanage\nand had gone up to Mr Lee.\u2019\n\u2018Did Horbury seemed relieved when you said that\u2019\n\u2018Do you know sir now you mention it he certainly did.",
    "His manner changed at once.",
    "Said\nMr Lee was a good old chap and free with his money\u2014rather disrepectfully he spoke\u2014and\nthen he went off.\u2019\n\u2018Which way\u2019\n\u2018Out through the door to the servants\u2019 hall.\u2019\nSugden interposed \u2018All that\u2019s O.K.",
    "sir.",
    "He passed through the kitchen where the cook and\nthe kitchen\u2010maid saw him and out through the back door.\u2019\n\u2018Now listen Tressilian and think carefully.",
    "Is there any means by which Horbury could\nreturn to the house without anyone seeing him\u2019\nThe old man shook his head.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t see how he could have done so sir.",
    "All the doors are locked on the inside.\u2019\n104\n\n\f\u2018Supposing he had had a key\u2019\n\u2018The doors are bolted as well.\u2019\n\u2018How does he get in when he comes\u2019\n\u2018He has a key of the back door sir.",
    "All the servants come in that way.\u2019\n\u2018He could have returned that way then\u2019\n\u2018Not without passing through the kitchen sir.",
    "And the kitchen would be occupied till well\nafter half\u2010past nine or a quarter to ten.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018That seems conclusive.",
    "Thank you Tressilian.\u2019\nThe old man got up and with a bow left the room.",
    "He returned however a minute or two\nlater.",
    "\u2018Horbury has just returned sir.",
    "Would you like to see him now\u2019\n\u2018Yes please send him in at once.\u2019\nXVII\nSydney Horbury did not present a very prepossessing appearance.",
    "He came into the room\nand stood rubbing his hands together and darting quick looks from one person to another.",
    "His manner was unctuous.",
    "Johnson said \u2018You\u2019re Sydney Horbury\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018Valet attendant to the late Mr Lee\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "It\u2019s terrible isn\u2019t it You could have knocked me down with a feather when I\nheard from Gladys.",
    "Poor old gentleman\u2014\u2019\nJohnson cut him short.",
    "\u2018Just answer my questions please.\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir certainly sir.\u2019\n\u2018What time did you go out tonight and where have you been\u2019\n\u2018I left the house just before eight sir.",
    "I went to the Superb sir just five minutes\u2019 walk\naway.",
    "Love in Old Seville was the picture sir.\u2019\n105\n\n\f\u2018Anyone who saw you there\u2019\n\u2018The young lady in the box office sir she knows me.",
    "And the commissionaire at the door\nhe knows me too.",
    "And\u2014er\u2014as a matter of fact I was with a young lady sir.",
    "I met her\nthere by appointment.\u2019\n\u2018Oh you did did you What\u2019s her name\u2019\n\u2018Doris Buckle sir.",
    "She works in the Combined Dairies sir 23 Markham Road.\u2019\n\u2018Good.",
    "We\u2019ll look into that.",
    "Did you come straight home\u2019\n\u2018I saw my young lady home first sir.",
    "Then I came straight back.",
    "You\u2019ll find it\u2019s quite all\nright sir.",
    "I didn\u2019t have anything to do with this.",
    "I was\u2014\u2019\nColonel Johnson said curtly \u2018Nobody\u2019s accusing you of having anything to do with it.\u2019\n\u2018No sir of course not sir.",
    "But it\u2019s not very pleasant when a murder happens in a house.\u2019\n\u2018Nobody said it was.",
    "Now then how long had you been in Mr Lee\u2019s service\u2019\n\u2018Just over a year sir.\u2019\n\u2018Did you like your place here\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "I was quite satisfied.",
    "The pay was good.",
    "Mr Lee was rather difficult sometimes\nbut of course I\u2019m used to attending on invalids.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve had previous experience\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes sir.",
    "I was with Major West and with the Honourable Jasper Finch\u2014\u2019\n\u2018You can give all those particulars to Sugden later.",
    "What I want to know is this At what\ntime did you last see Mr Lee this evening\u2019\n\u2018It was about half\u2010past seven sir.",
    "Mr Lee had a light supper brought to him every evening\nat seven o\u2019clock.",
    "I then prepared him for bed.",
    "After that he would sit in front of the fire in\nhis dressing\u2010gown till he felt like going to bed.\u2019\n\u2018What time was that usually\u2019\n\u2018It varied sir.",
    "Sometimes he would go to bed as early as eight o\u2019clock\u2014that\u2019s if he felt\ntired.",
    "Sometimes he would sit up till eleven or after.\u2019\n\u2018What did he do when he did want to go to bed\u2019\n\u2018Usually he rang for me sir.\u2019\n106\n\n\f\u2018And you assisted him to bed\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018But this was your evening out.",
    "Did you always have Fridays\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "Friday was my regular day.\u2019\n\u2018What happened then when Mr Lee wanted to go to bed\u2019\n\u2018He would ring his bell and either Tressilian or Walter would see to him.\u2019\n\u2018He was not helpless He could move about\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir but not very easily.",
    "Rheumatoid arthritis was what he suffered from sir.",
    "He was\nworse some days than others.\u2019\n\u2018Did he never go into another room in the daytime\u2019\n\u2018No sir.",
    "He preferred to be in just the one room.",
    "Mr Lee wasn\u2019t luxurious in his tastes.",
    "It\nwas a big room with plenty of air and light in it.\u2019\n\u2018Mr Lee had his supper at seven you say\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "I took the tray away and put out the sherry and two glasses on the bureau.\u2019\n\u2018Why did you do that\u2019\n\u2018Mr Lee\u2019s orders.\u2019\n\u2018Was that usual\u2019\n\u2018Sometimes.",
    "It was the rule that none of the family came to see Mr Lee in the evening\nunless he invited them.",
    "Some evenings he liked to be alone.",
    "Other evenings he\u2019d send\ndown and ask Mr Alfred or Mrs Alfred or both of them to come up after dinner.\u2019\n\u2018But as far as you know he had not done so on this occasion That is he had not sent a\nmessage to any member of the family requesting their presence\u2019\n\u2018He hadn\u2019t sent any message by me sir.\u2019\n\u2018So that he wasn\u2019t expecting any of the family\u2019\n\u2018He might have asked one of them personally sir.\u2019\n\u2018Of course.\u2019\n\n107\n\n\fHorbury continued \u2018I saw that everything was in order wished Mr Lee goodnight and left\nthe room.\u2019\nPoirot asked \u2018Did you make up the fire before you left the room\u2019\nThe valet hesitated.",
    "\u2018It wasn\u2019t necessary sir.",
    "It was well built up.\u2019\n\u2018Could Mr Lee have done that himself\u2019\n\u2018Oh no sir.",
    "I expect Mr Harry Lee had done it.\u2019\n\u2018Mr Harry Lee was with him when you came in before supper\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "He went away when I came.\u2019\n\u2018What was the relationship between the two as far as you could judge\u2019\n\u2018Mr Harry Lee seemed in very good spirits sir.",
    "Throwing back his head and laughing a good\ndeal.\u2019\n\u2018And Mr Lee\u2019\n\u2018He was quiet and rather thoughtful.\u2019\n\u2018I see.",
    "Now there\u2019s something more I want to know Horbury What can you tell us about\nthe diamonds Mr Lee kept in his safe\u2019\n\u2018Diamonds sir I never saw any diamonds.\u2019\n\u2018Mr Lee kept a quantity of uncut stones there.",
    "You must have seen him handling them.\u2019\n\u2018Those funny little pebbles sir Yes I did see him with them once or twice.",
    "But I didn\u2019t\nknow they were diamonds.",
    "He was showing them to the foreign young lady only\nyesterday\u2014or was it the day before\u2019\nColonel Johnson said abruptly \u2018These stones have been stolen.\u2019\nHorbury cried out \u2018I hope you don\u2019t think sir that I had anything to do with it\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not making any accusations\u2019 said Johnson.",
    "\u2018Now then is there anything you can tell\nus that has any bearing on this matter\u2019\n\u2018The diamonds sir Or the murder\u2019\n\u2018Both.\u2019\n108\n\n\f\u2018Horbury considered.",
    "He passed his tongue over his pale lips.",
    "At last he looked up with\neyes that were a shade furtive.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything sir.\u2019\nPoirot said softly \u2018Nothing you\u2019ve overheard say in the course of your duties which\nmight be helpful\u2019\nThe valet\u2019s eyelids flickered a little.",
    "\u2018No sir I don\u2019t think so sir.",
    "There was a little awkwardness between Mr Lee and\u2014and\nsome members of his family.\u2019\n\u2018Which members\u2019\n\u2018I gathered there was a little trouble over Mr Harry Lee\u2019s return.",
    "Mr Alfred Lee resented it.",
    "I understand he and his father had a few words about it\u2014but that was all there was to it.",
    "Mr Lee didn\u2019t accuse him for a minute of having taken any diamonds.",
    "And I\u2019m sure Mr\nAlfred wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u2019\nPoirot said quickly \u2018His interview with Mr Alfred was after he had discovered the loss of\nthe diamonds was it not though\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\nPoirot leaned forward.",
    "\u2018I thought Horbury\u2019 he said softly \u2018that you did not know of the theft of the diamonds\nuntil we informed you of it just now.",
    "How then do you know that Mr Lee had discovered\nhis loss before he had this conversation with his son\u2019\nHorbury turned brick red.",
    "\u2018No use lying.",
    "Out with it\u2019 said Sugden.",
    "\u2018When did you know\u2019\nHorbury said sullenly \u2018I heard him telephoning to someone about it.\u2019\n\u2018You weren\u2019t in the room\u2019\n\u2018No outside the door.",
    "Couldn\u2019t hear much\u2014only a word or two.\u2019\n\u2018What did you hear exactly\u2019 asked Poirot sweetly.",
    "\u2018I heard the words robbery and diamonds and I heard him say \u201cI don\u2019t know who to\nsuspect\u201d\u2014and I heard him say something about this evening at eight o\u2019clock.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden nodded.",
    "109\n\n\f\u2018That was to me he was speaking my lad.",
    "About five\u2010ten was it\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s right sir.\u2019\n\u2018And when you went into his room afterwards did he look upset\u2019\n\u2018Just a bit sir.",
    "Seemed absent\u2010minded and worried.\u2019\n\u2018So much so that you got the wind up\u2014eh\u2019\n\u2018Look here Mr Sugden I won\u2019t have you saying things like that.",
    "Never touched any\ndiamonds I didn\u2019t and you can\u2019t prove I did.",
    "I\u2019m not a thief.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden unimpressed said \u2018That remains to be seen.\u2019 He glanced\nquestioningly at the chief constable received a nod and went on \u2018That\u2019ll do for you my\nlad.",
    "Shan\u2019t want you again tonight.\u2019\nHorbury went out gratefully in haste.",
    "Sugden said appreciatively \u2018Pretty bit of work M. Poirot.",
    "You trapped him as neatly as I\u2019ve\never seen it done.",
    "He may be a thief or he may not but he\u2019s certainly a first\u2010class liar\u2019\n\u2018An unprepossessing person\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Nasty bit of goods\u2019 agreed Johnson.",
    "\u2018Question is what do we think of his evidence\u2019\nSugden summarized the position neatly.",
    "\u2018Seems to me there are three possibilities 1 Horbury\u2019s a thief and a murderer.",
    "2\nHorbury\u2019s a thief but not a murderer.",
    "3 Horbury\u2019s an innocent man.",
    "Certain amount of\nevidence for 1.",
    "He overheard telephone call and knew the theft had been discovered.",
    "Gathered from old man\u2019s manner that he was suspected.",
    "Made his plans accordingly.",
    "Went out ostentatiously at eight o\u2019clock and cooked up an alibi.",
    "Easy enough to slip out of\na cinema and return there unnoticed.",
    "He\u2019d have to be pretty sure of the girl though that\nshe wouldn\u2019t give him away.",
    "I\u2019ll see what I can get out of her tomorrow.\u2019\n\u2018How then did he manage to re\u2010enter the house\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s more difficult\u2019 Sugden admitted.",
    "\u2018But there might be ways.",
    "Say one of the women\nservants unlocked a side door for him.\u2019\nPoirot raised his eyebrows quizzically.",
    "\u2018He places then his life at the mercy of two women With one woman it would be taking\na big risk with two\u2014eh bien I find the risk fantastic\u2019\nSugden said \u2018Some criminals think they can get away with anything\u2019\n110\n\n\fHe went on \u2018Let\u2019s take 2.",
    "Horbury pinched those diamonds.",
    "He took \u2019em out of the\nhouse tonight and has possibly passed them on to some accomplice.",
    "That\u2019s quite easy\ngoing and highly probable.",
    "Now we\u2019ve got to admit that somebody else chose this night to\nmurder Mr Lee.",
    "That somebody being quite unaware of the diamond complication.",
    "It\u2019s\npossible of course but it\u2019s a bit of a coincidence.",
    "\u2018Possibility 3\u2014Horbury\u2019s innocent.",
    "Somebody else both took the diamonds and\nmurdered the old gentleman.",
    "There it is it\u2019s up to us to get at the truth.\u2019\nColonel Johnson yawned.",
    "He looked again at his watch and got up.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 he said \u2018I think we\u2019ll call it a night eh Better just have a look in the safe before we\ngo.",
    "Odd thing if those wretched diamonds were there all the time.\u2019\nBut the diamonds were not in the safe.",
    "They found the combination where Alfred Lee had\ntold them in the small note\u2010book taken from the dressing\u2010gown pocket of the dead man.",
    "In the safe they found an empty chamois\u2010leather bag.",
    "Among the papers the safe\ncontained only one was of interest.",
    "It was a will dated some fifteen years previously.",
    "After various legacies and bequests the\nprovisions were simple enough.",
    "Half Simeon Lee\u2019s fortune went to Alfred Lee.",
    "The other\nhalf was to be divided in equal shares between his remaining children Harry George\nDavid and Jennifer.",
    "111\n\n\f112\n\n\fPart 4\nDecember 25th\nIn the bright sun of Christmas noon Poirot walked in the gardens of Gorston Hall.",
    "The Hall\nitself was a large solidly built house with no special architectural pretensions.",
    "Here on the south side was a broad terrace flanked with a hedge of clipped yew.",
    "Little\nplants grew in the interstices of the stone flags and at intervals along the terrace there\nwere stone sinks arranged as miniature gardens.",
    "Poirot surveyed them with benign approval.",
    "He murmured to himself \u2018C\u2019est bien imagin\u00e9\nc\u00b8a\u2019\nIn the distance he caught sight of two figures going towards an ornamental sheet of water\nsome three hundred yards away.",
    "Pilar was easily recognizable as one of the figures and he\nthought at first the other was Stephen Farr then he saw that the man with Pilar was Harry\nLee.",
    "Harry seemed very attentive to his attractive niece.",
    "At intervals he flung his head back\nand laughed then bent once more attentively towards her.",
    "\u2018Assuredly there is one who does not mourn\u2019 Poirot murmured to himself.",
    "A soft sound behind him made him turn.",
    "Magdalene Lee was standing there.",
    "She too was\nlooking at the retreating figures of the man and girl.",
    "She turned her head and smiled\nenchantingly at Poirot.",
    "She said \u2018It\u2019s such a glorious sunny day One can hardly believe in\nall the horrors of last night can one M. Poirot\u2019\n\u2018It is difficult truly madame.\u2019\nMagdalene sighed.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve never been mixed up in tragedy before.",
    "I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve really only just grown up.",
    "I stayed a\nchild too long I think\u2014That\u2019s not a good thing to do.\u2019\nAgain she sighed.",
    "She said \u2018Pilar now seems so extraordinarily self\u2010possessed\u2014I suppose\nit\u2019s the Spanish blood.",
    "It\u2019s all very odd isn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018What is odd madame\u2019\n\u2018The way she turned up here out of the blue\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I have learned that Mr Lee had been searching for her for some time.",
    "He had\nbeen in correspondence with the Consulate in Madrid and with the vice\u2010consul at\nAliquara where her mother died.\u2019\n\u2018He was very secretive about it all\u2019 said Magdalene.",
    "\u2018Alfred knew nothing about it.",
    "No\nmore did Lydia.\u2019\n113\n\n\f\u2018Ah\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "Magdalene came a little nearer to him.",
    "He could smell the delicate perfume she used.",
    "\u2018You know M. Poirot there\u2019s some story connected with Jennifer\u2019s husband Estravados.",
    "He died quite soon after the marriage and there\u2019s some mystery about it.",
    "Alfred and Lydia\nknow.",
    "I believe it was something\u2014rather disgraceful...\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019 said Poirot \u2018is indeed sad.\u2019\nMagdalene said \u2018My husband feels\u2014and I agree with him\u2014that the family ought to have\nbeen told more about the girl\u2019s antecedents.",
    "After all if her father was a criminal\u2014\u2019\nShe paused but Hercule Poirot said nothing.",
    "He seemed to be admiring such beauties of\nnature as could be seen in the winter season in the grounds of Gorston Hall.",
    "Magdalene said \u2018I can\u2019t help feeling that the manner of my father\u2010in\u2010law\u2019s death was\nsomehow significant.",
    "It\u2014it was so very unEnglish.\u2019\nHercule Poirot turned slowly.",
    "His grave eyes met hers in innocent inquiry.",
    "\u2018Ah\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018The Spanish touch you think\u2019\n\u2018Well they are cruel aren\u2019t they\u2019 Magdalene spoke with an effect of childish appeal.",
    "\u2018All\nthose bull fights and things\u2019\nHercule Poirot said pleasantly \u2018You are saying that in your opinion se\u00f1orita Estravados cut\nher grandfather\u2019s throat\u2019\n\u2018Oh no M. Poirot\u2019 Magdalene was vehement.",
    "She was shocked.",
    "\u2018I never said anything of\nthe kind Indeed I didn\u2019t\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Perhaps you did not.\u2019\n\u2018But I do think that she is\u2014well a suspicious person.",
    "The furtive way she picked up\nsomething from the floor of that room last night for instance.\u2019\nA different note crept into Hercule Poirot\u2019s voice.",
    "He said sharply \u2018She picked up\nsomething from the floor last night\u2019\nMagdalene nodded.",
    "Her childish mouth curved spitefully.",
    "\u2018Yes as soon as we got into the room.",
    "She gave a quick glance round to see if anyone was\nlooking and then pounced on it.",
    "But the superintendent man saw her I\u2019m glad to say and\nmade her give it up.\u2019\n\u2018What was it that she picked up do you know madame\u2019\n114\n\n\f\u2018No.",
    "I wasn\u2019t near enough to see.\u2019 Magdalene\u2019s voice held regret.",
    "\u2018It was something quite\nsmall.\u2019\nPoirot frowned to himself.",
    "\u2018It is interesting that\u2019 he murmured to himself.",
    "Magdalene said quickly \u2018Yes I thought you ought to know about it.",
    "After all we don\u2019t\nknow anything about Pilar\u2019s upbringing and what her life has been like.",
    "Alfred is always so\nsuspicious and dear Lydia is so casual.\u2019 Then she murmured \u2018Perhaps I\u2019d better go and see\nif I can help Lydia in any way.",
    "There may be letters to write.\u2019\nShe left him with a smile of satisfied malice on her lips.",
    "Poirot remained lost in thought on the terrace.",
    "II\nTo him there came Superintendent Sugden.",
    "The police superintendent looked gloomy.",
    "He\nsaid \u2018Good morning Mr Poirot.",
    "Doesn\u2019t seem quite the right thing to say Merry\nChristmas does it\u2019\n\u2018Mon cher coll\u00e8gue I certainly do not observe any traces of merriment on your\ncountenance.",
    "If you had said Merry Christmas I should not have replied \u201cMany of them\u201d \u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t want another one like this one and that\u2019s a fact\u2019 said Sugden.",
    "\u2018You have made the progress yes\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve checked up on a good many points.",
    "Horbury\u2019s alibi is holding water all right.",
    "The\ncommissionaire at the cinema saw him go in with the girl and saw him come out with her\nat the end of the performance and seems pretty positive he didn\u2019t leave and couldn\u2019t\nhave left and returned during the performance.",
    "The girl swears quite definitely he was\nwith her in the cinema all the time.\u2019\nPoirot\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "\u2018I hardly see then what more there is to say.\u2019\nThe cynical Sugden said \u2018Well one never knows with girls Lie themselves black in the face\nfor the sake of a man.\u2019\n\u2018That does credit to their hearts\u2019 said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Sugden growled.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s a foreign way of looking at it.",
    "It\u2019s defeating the ends of justice.\u2019\n115\n\n\fHercule Poirot said \u2018Justice is a very strange thing.",
    "Have you ever reflected on it\u2019\nSugden stared at him.",
    "He said \u2018You\u2019re a queer one Mr Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018Not at all.",
    "I follow a logical train of thought.",
    "But we will not enter into a dispute on the\nquestion.",
    "It is your belief then that this demoiselle from the milk shop is not speaking the\ntruth\u2019\nSugden shook his head.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 he said \u2018it\u2019s not like that at all.",
    "As a matter of fact I think she is telling the truth.",
    "She\u2019s a simple kind of girl and I think if she was telling me a pack of lies I\u2019d spot it.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You have the experience yes\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s just it Mr Poirot.",
    "One does know more or less after a lifetime of taking down\nstatements when a person\u2019s lying and when they\u2019re not.",
    "No I think the girl\u2019s evidence is\ngenuine and if so Horbury couldn\u2019t have murdered old Mr Lee and that brings us right\nback to the people in the house.\u2019\nHe drew a deep breath.",
    "\u2018One of \u2019em did it Mr Poirot.",
    "One of \u2019em did it.",
    "But which\u2019\n\u2018You have no new data\u2019\n\u2018Yes I\u2019ve had a certain amount of luck over the telephone calls.",
    "Mr George Lee put\nthrough a call to Westeringham at two minutes to nine.",
    "That call lasted under six minutes.\u2019\n\u2018Aha\u2019\n\u2018As you say Moreover no other call was put through\u2014to Westeringham or anywhere\nelse.\u2019\n\u2018Very interesting\u2019 said Poirot with approval.",
    "\u2018M.",
    "George Lee says he has just finished\ntelephoning when he hears the noise overhead\u2014but actually he had finished telephoning\nnearly ten minutes before that.",
    "Where was he in those ten minutes Mrs George Lee says\nthat she was telephoning\u2014but actually she never put through a call at all.",
    "Where was\nshe\u2019\nSugden said \u2018I saw you talking to her M. Poirot\u2019\nHis voice held a question but Poirot replied \u2018You are in error\u2019\n\u2018Eh\u2019\n\u2018I was not talking to her\u2014she was talking to me\u2019\n116\n\n\f\u2018Oh\u2014\u2019 Sugden seemed to be about to brush the distinction aside impatiently then as its\nsignificance sank in he said \u2018She was talking to you you say\u2019\n\u2018Most definitely.",
    "She came out here for that purpose.\u2019\n\u2018What did she have to say\u2019\n\u2018She wished to stress certain points the unEnglish character of the crime\u2014the possibly\nundesirable antecedents of Miss Estravados on the paternal side\u2014the fact that Miss\nEstravados had furtively picked up something from the floor last night.\u2019\n\u2018She told you that did she\u2019 said Sugden with interest.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "What was it that the se\u00f1orita picked up\u2019\nSugden sighed.",
    "\u2018I could give you three hundred guesses I\u2019ll show it to you.",
    "It\u2019s the sort of thing that solves\nthe whole mystery in detective stories If you can make anything out of it I\u2019ll retire from\nthe police force\u2019\n\u2018Show it me.\u2019\nSugden took an envelope from his pocket and tilted its contents on to the palm of his\nhand.",
    "A faint grin showed on his face.",
    "\u2018There you are.",
    "What do you make of it\u2019\nOn the superintendent\u2019s broad palm lay a little triangular piece of pink rubber and a small\nwooden peg.",
    "His grin broadened as Poirot picked up the articles and frowned over them.",
    "\u2018Make anything of them Mr Poirot\u2019\n\u2018This little piece of stuff might have been cut from a spongebag\u2019\n\u2018It was.",
    "It comes from a spongebag in Mr Lee\u2019s room.",
    "Somebody with sharp scissors just\ncut a small triangular piece out of it.",
    "Mr Lee may have done it himself for all I know.",
    "But it\nbeats me why he should do it.",
    "Horbury can\u2019t throw any light on the matter.",
    "As for the peg\nit\u2019s about the size of a crib\u2010bage peg but they\u2019re usually made of ivory.",
    "This is just rough\nwood\u2014whittled out of a bit of deal I should say.\u2019\n\u2018Most remarkable\u2019 murmured Poirot.",
    "\u2018Keep \u2019em if you like\u2019 said Sugden kindly.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t want them.\u2019\n\u2018Mon ami I would not deprive you of them\u2019\n117\n\n\f\u2018They don\u2019t mean anything at all to you\u2019\n\u2018I must confess\u2014nothing whatever\u2019\n\u2018Splendid\u2019 said Sugden with heavy sarcasm returning them to his pocket.",
    "\u2018We are getting\non\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Mrs George Lee she recounts that the young lady stooped and picked these\nbagatelles up in a furtive manner.",
    "Should you say that that was true\u2019\nSugden considered the point.",
    "\u2018N\u2010o\u2019 he said hesitatingly.",
    "\u2018I shouldn\u2019t quite go as far as that.",
    "She didn\u2019t look guilty\u2014\nnothing of that kind\u2014but she did set about it rather\u2014well quickly and quietly\u2014if you\nknow what I mean.",
    "And she didn\u2019t know I\u2019d seen her do it That I\u2019m sure of.",
    "She jumped\nwhen I rounded on her.\u2019\nPoirot said thoughtfully \u2018Then there was a reason But what conceivable reason could\nthere have been That little piece of rubber is quite fresh.",
    "It has not been used for\nanything.",
    "It can have no meaning whatsoever and yet\u2014\u2019\nSugden said impatiently \u2018Well you can worry about it if you like Mr Poirot.",
    "I\u2019ve got other\nthings to think about.\u2019\nPoirot asked \u2018The case stands\u2014where in your opinion\u2019\nSugden took out his note\u2010book.",
    "\u2018Let\u2019s get down to facts.",
    "To begin with there are the people who couldn\u2019t have done it.",
    "Let\u2019s get them out of the way first\u2014\u2019\n\u2018They are\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Alfred and Harry Lee.",
    "They\u2019ve got a definite alibi.",
    "Also Mrs Alfred Lee since Tressilian saw\nher in the drawing\u2010room only about a minute before the row started upstairs.",
    "Those three\nare clear.",
    "Now for the others.",
    "Here\u2019s a list.",
    "I\u2019ve put it this way for clearness.\u2019\nHe handed the book to Poirot.",
    "At the time of the crime\nGeorge Lee\nMrs George Lee\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee\nplaying piano in music\u2010room\nconfirmed by his wife\n118\n\n\fMrs David Lee\nin music\u2010room\nconfirmed by husband\nMiss Estravados\nin her bedroom\nno confirmation\nStephen Farr\nin ballroom playing gramophone\nconfirmed by three of staff who could hear the music in servants\u2019 hall.",
    "Poirot said handing back the list \u2018And therefore\u2019\n\u2018And therefore\u2019 said Sugden \u2018George Lee could have killed the old man.",
    "Mrs George Lee\ncould have killed him.",
    "Pilar Estravados could have killed him and either Mr or Mrs David\nLee could have killed him but not both.\u2019\n\u2018You do not then accept that alibi\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden shook his head emphatically.",
    "\u2018Not on your life Husband and wife\u2014devoted to each other They may be in it together\nor if one of them did it the other is ready to swear to an alibi.",
    "I look at it this way\nSomeone was in the music\u2010room playing the piano.",
    "It may have been David Lee.",
    "It\nprobably was since he was an acknowledged musician but there\u2019s nothing to say his wife\nwas there too except her word and his.",
    "In the same way it may have been Hilda who was\nplaying that piano while David Lee crept upstairs and killed his father No it\u2019s an\nabsolutely different case from the two brothers in the dining\u2010room.",
    "Alfred Lee and Harry\nLee don\u2019t love each other.",
    "Neither of them would perjure himself for the other\u2019s sake.\u2019\n\u2018What about Stephen Farr\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s a possible suspect because that gramophone alibi is a bit thin.",
    "On the other hand it\u2019s\nthe sort of alibi that\u2019s really sounder than a good cast\u2010iron dyed\u2010in\u2010the\u2010wool alibi which\nten to one has been faked up beforehand\u2019\nPoirot bowed his head thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018I know what you mean.",
    "It is the alibi of a man who did not know that he would be called\nupon to provide such a thing.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly And anyway somehow I don\u2019t believe a stranger was mixed up in this thing.\u2019\nPoirot said quickly \u2018I agree with you.",
    "It is here a family affair.",
    "It is a poison that works in\nthe blood\u2014it is intimate\u2014it is deep\u2010seated.",
    "There is here I think hate and knowledge...\u2019\nHe waved his hands.",
    "119\n\n\f\u2018I do not know\u2014it is difficult\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden had waited respectfully but without being much impressed.",
    "He\nsaid \u2018Quite so Mr Poirot.",
    "But we\u2019ll get at it never fear with elimination and logic.",
    "We\u2019ve\ngot the possibilities now\u2014the people with opportunity.",
    "George Lee Magdalene Lee David\nLee Hilda Lee Pilar Estravados and I\u2019ll add Stephen Farr.",
    "Now we come to motive.",
    "Who\nhad a motive for putting old Mr Lee out of the way There again we can wash out certain\npeople.",
    "Miss Estravados for one.",
    "I gather that as the will stands now she doesn\u2019t get\nanything at all.",
    "If Simeon Lee had died before her mother her mother\u2019s share would have\ncome down to her unless her mother willed it otherwise but as Jennifer Estravados\npredeceased Simeon Lee that particular legacy reverts to the other members of the\nfamily.",
    "So it was definitely to Miss Estravados\u2019 interests to keep the old man alive.",
    "He\u2019d\ntaken a fancy to her it\u2019s pretty certain he\u2019d have left her a good slice of money when he\nmade a new will.",
    "She had everything to lose and nothing to gain by his murder.",
    "You agree\nto that\u2019\n\u2018Perfectly.\u2019\n\u2018There remains of course the possibility that she cut his throat in the heat of a quarrel\nbut that seems extremely unlikely to me.",
    "To begin with they were on the best of terms\nand she hadn\u2019t been here long enough to bear him a grudge about anything.",
    "It therefore\nseems highly unlikely that Miss Estravados has anything to do with the crime\u2014except that\nyou might argue that to cut a man\u2019s throat is an unEnglish sort of thing to do as your\nfriend Mrs George put it\u2019\n\u2018Do not call her my friend\u2019 said Poirot hastily.",
    "\u2018Or I shall speak of your friend Miss\nEstravados who finds you such a handsome man\u2019\nHe had the pleasure of seeing the superintendent\u2019s official poise upset again.",
    "The police\nofficer turned crimson.",
    "Poirot looked at him with malicious amusement.",
    "He said and there was a wistful note in his voice \u2018It is true that your moustache is\nsuperb... Tell me do you use for it a special pomade\u2019\n\u2018Pomade Good lord no\u2019\n\u2018What do you use\u2019\n\u2018Use Nothing at all.",
    "It\u2014it just grows.\u2019\nPoirot sighed.",
    "\u2018You are favoured by nature.\u2019 He caressed his own luxuriant black moustache then sighed.",
    "\u2018However expensive the preparation\u2019 he murmured \u2018to restore the natural colour does\nsomewhat impoverish the quality of the hair.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden uninterested in hair\u2010dressing problems was continuing in a stolid\nmanner \u2018Considering the motive for the crime I should say that we can probably wash\n120\n\n\fout Mr Stephen Farr.",
    "It\u2019s just possible that there was some hanky\u2010panky between his\nfather and Mr Lee and the former suffered but I doubt it.",
    "Farr\u2019s manner was too easy and\nassured when he mentioned that subject.",
    "He was quite confident\u2014and I don\u2019t think he\nwas acting.",
    "No I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find anything there.\u2019\n\u2018I do not think you will\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018And there\u2019s one other person with a motive for keeping old Mr Lee alive\u2014his son Harry.",
    "It\u2019s true that he benefits under the will but I don\u2019t believe he was aware of the fact.",
    "Certainly couldn\u2019t have been sure of it The general impression seemed to be that Harry\nhad been definitely cut out of his share of the inheritance at the time he cut loose.",
    "But\nnow he was on the point of coming back into favour It was all to his advantage that his\nfather should make a new will.",
    "He wouldn\u2019t be such a fool as to kill him now.",
    "Actually as\nwe know he couldn\u2019t have done it.",
    "You see we\u2019re getting on we\u2019re clearing quite a lot of\npeople out of the way.\u2019\n\u2018How true.",
    "Very soon there will be nobody left\u2019\nSugden grinned.",
    "\u2018We\u2019re not going as fast as that We\u2019ve got George Lee and his wife and David Lee and\nMrs David.",
    "They all benefit by the death and George Lee from all I can make out is\ngrasping about money.",
    "Moreover his father was threatening to cut down supplies.",
    "So\nwe\u2019ve got George Lee with motive and opportunity\u2019\n\u2018Continue\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018And we\u2019ve got Mrs George As fond of money as a cat is fond of cream and I\u2019d be\nprepared to bet she\u2019s heavily in debt at the minute She was jealous of the Spanish girl.",
    "She was quick to spot that the other was gaining an ascendancy over the old man.",
    "She\u2019d\nheard him say that he was sending for the lawyer.",
    "So she struck quickly.",
    "You could make\nout a case.\u2019\n\u2018Possibly.\u2019\n\u2018Then there\u2019s David Lee and his wife.",
    "They inherit under the present will but I don\u2019t\nbelieve somehow that the money motive would be particularly strong in their case.\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "David Lee seems to be a bit of a dreamer\u2014not a mercenary type.",
    "But he\u2019s\u2014well he\u2019s\nodd.",
    "As I see it there are three possible motives for this murder There\u2019s the diamond\ncomplication there\u2019s the will and there\u2019s\u2014well\u2014just plain hate.\u2019\n\u2018Ah you see that do you\u2019\n\n121\n\n\fSugden said \u2018Naturally.",
    "It\u2019s been present in my mind all along.",
    "If David Lee killed his\nfather I don\u2019t think it was for money.",
    "And if he was the criminal it might explain the\u2014well\nthe blood\u2010letting\u2019\nPoirot looked at him appreciatively.",
    "\u2018Yes I wondered when you would take that into consideration.",
    "So much blood\u2014that is\nwhat Mrs Alfred said.",
    "It takes one back to ancient rituals\u2014to blood sacrifice to the\nanointing with the blood of the sacrifice...\u2019\nSugden said frowning \u2018You mean whoever did it was mad\u2019\n\u2018Mon cher\u2014there are all sorts of deep instincts in man of which he himself is unaware.",
    "The craving for blood\u2014the demand for sacrifice\u2019\nSugden said doubtfully \u2018David Lee looks a quiet harmless fellow.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You do not understand the psychology.",
    "David Lee is a man who lives in the\npast\u2014a man in whom the memory of his mother is still very much alive.",
    "He kept away\nfrom his father for many years because he could not forgive his father\u2019s treatment of his\nmother.",
    "He came here let us suppose to forgive.",
    "But he may not have been able to\nforgive... We do know one thing\u2014that when David Lee stood by his father\u2019s dead body\nsome part of him was appeased and satisfied.",
    "\u201cThe mills of God grind slowly yet they\ngrind exceeding small.\u201d Retribution Payment The wrong wiped out by expiation\u2019\nSugden gave a sudden shudder.",
    "He said \u2018Don\u2019t talk like that Mr Poirot.",
    "You give me quite\na turn.",
    "It may be that it\u2019s as you say.",
    "If so Mrs David knows\u2014and means to shield him all\nshe knows how.",
    "I can imagine her doing that.",
    "On the other hand I can\u2019t imagine her being\na murderess.",
    "She\u2019s such a comfortable commonplace sort of woman.\u2019\nPoirot looked at him curiously.",
    "\u2018So she strikes you like that\u2019 he murmured.",
    "\u2018Well yes\u2014a homely body if you know what I mean\u2019\n\u2018Oh I know what you mean perfectly\u2019\nSugden looked at him.",
    "\u2018Come now Mr Poirot you\u2019ve got ideas about the case.",
    "Let\u2019s have them.\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018I have ideas yes but they are rather nebulous.",
    "Let me first hear your\nsumming\u2010up of the case.\u2019\n\u2018Well it\u2019s as I said\u2014three possible motives hate gain and this diamond complication.",
    "Take the facts chronologically.",
    "122\n\n\f\u20183.30.",
    "Family gathering.",
    "Telephone conversation to lawyer overheard by all the family.",
    "Then the old man lets loose on his family tells them where they all get off.",
    "They slink out\nlike a lot of scared rabbits.\u2019\n\u2018Hilda Lee remained behind\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018So she did.",
    "But not for long.",
    "Then about six Alfred has an interview with his father\u2014\nunpleasant interview.",
    "Harry is to be reinstated.",
    "Alfred isn\u2019t pleased.",
    "Alfred of course\nought to be our principal suspect.",
    "He had by far the strongest motive.",
    "However to get on\nHarry comes along next.",
    "Is in boisterous spirits.",
    "Has got the old man just where he wants\nhim.",
    "But before those two interviews Simeon Lee has discovered the loss of the diamonds\nand has telephoned to me.",
    "He doesn\u2019t mention his loss to either of his two sons.",
    "Why In\nmy opinion because he was quite sure neither of them had anything to do with it.",
    "Neither\nof them were under suspicion.",
    "I believe as I\u2019ve said all along that the old man suspected\nHorbury and one other person.",
    "And I\u2019m pretty sure of what he meant to do.",
    "Remember\nhe said definitely he didn\u2019t want anyone to come and sit with him that evening.",
    "Why\nBecause he was preparing the way for two things First my visit and second the visit of\nthat other suspected person.",
    "He did ask someone to come and see him immediately after\ndinner.",
    "Now who was that person likely to be Might have been George Lee.",
    "Much more\nlikely to have been his wife.",
    "And there\u2019s another person who comes back into the picture\nhere\u2014Pilar Estravados.",
    "He\u2019s shown her the diamonds.",
    "He\u2019d told her their value.",
    "How do\nwe know that girl isn\u2019t a thief Remember these mysterious hints about the disgraceful\nbehaviour of her father.",
    "Perhaps he was a professional thief and finally went to prison for\nit.\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018And so as you say Pilar Estravados comes back into the picture...\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2014as a thief.",
    "No other way.",
    "She may have lost her head when she was found out.",
    "She\nmay have flown at her grandfather and attacked him.\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018It is possible\u2014yes...\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden looked at him keenly.",
    "\u2018But that\u2019s not your idea Come Mr Poirot what is your idea\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I go back always to the same thing the character of the dead man.",
    "What\nmanner of a man was Simeon Lee\u2019\n\u2018There isn\u2019t much mystery about that\u2019 said Sugden staring.",
    "\u2018Tell me then.",
    "That is to say tell me from the local point of view what was known of the\nman.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden drew a doubtful finger along his jawbone.",
    "He looked perplexed.",
    "He said \u2018I\u2019m not a local man myself.",
    "I come from Reeveshire over the border\u2014next\ncounty.",
    "But of course old Mr Lee was a well\u2010known figure in these parts.",
    "I know all about\nhim by hearsay.\u2019\n123\n\n\f\u2018Yes And that hearsay was\u2014what\u2019\nSugden said \u2018Well he was a sharp customer there weren\u2019t many who could get the\nbetter of him.",
    "But he was generous with his money.",
    "Openhanded as they make \u2019em.",
    "Beats\nme how Mr George Lee can be the exact opposite and be his father\u2019s son.\u2019\n\u2018Ah But there are two distinct strains in the family.",
    "Alfred George and David resemble\u2014\nsuperficially at least\u2014their mother\u2019s side of the family.",
    "I have been looking at some\nportraits in the gallery this morning.\u2019\n\u2018He was hot\u2010tempered\u2019 continued Superintendent Sugden \u2018and of course he had a bad\nreputation with women\u2014that was in his younger days.",
    "He\u2019s been an invalid for many\nyears now.",
    "But even there he always behaved generously.",
    "If there was trouble he always\npaid up handsomely and got the girl married off as often as not.",
    "He may have been a bad\nlot but he wasn\u2019t mean.",
    "He treated his wife badly ran after other women and neglected\nher.",
    "She died of a broken heart so they say.",
    "It\u2019s a convenient term but I believe she was\nreally very unhappy poor lady.",
    "She was always sickly and never went about much.",
    "There\u2019s\nno doubt that Mr Lee was an odd character.",
    "Had a revengeful streak in him too.",
    "If anyone\ndid him a nasty turn he always paid it back so they say and didn\u2019t mind how long he had\nto wait to do it.\u2019\n\u2018The mills of God grind slowly yet they grind exceeding small\u2019 murmured Poirot.",
    "Superintendent Sugden said heavily \u2018Mills of the devil more likely Nothing saintly about\nSimeon Lee.",
    "The kind of man you might say had sold his soul to the devil and enjoyed the\nbargain And he was proud too proud as Lucifer.\u2019\n\u2018Proud as Lucifer\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018It is suggestive what you say there.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said looking puzzled \u2018You don\u2019t mean that he was murdered\nbecause he was proud\u2019\n\u2018I mean\u2019 said Poirot \u2018that there is such a thing as inheritance.",
    "Simeon Lee transmitted\nthat pride to his sons\u2014\u2019\nHe broke off.",
    "Hilda Lee had come out of the house and was standing looking along the\nterrace.",
    "III\n\u2018I wanted to find you M. Poirot.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden had excused himself and gone back into the house.",
    "Looking after him Hilda said \u2018I didn\u2019t know he was with you.",
    "I thought he was with Pilar.",
    "He seems a nice man quite considerate.\u2019\nHer voice was pleasant a low soothing cadence to it.",
    "124\n\n\fPoirot asked \u2018You wanted to see me you say\u2019\nShe inclined her head.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "I think you can help me.\u2019\n\u2018I shall be delighted to do so madame.\u2019\nShe said \u2018You are a very intelligent man M. Poirot.",
    "I saw that last night.",
    "There are things\nwhich you will I think find out quite easily.",
    "I want you to understand my husband.\u2019\n\u2018Yes madame\u2019\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t talk like this to Superintendent Sugden.",
    "He wouldn\u2019t understand.",
    "But you will.\u2019\nPoirot bowed.",
    "\u2018You honour me madame.\u2019\nHilda went calmly on \u2018My husband for many years ever since I married him has been\nwhat I can only describe as a mental cripple.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019\n\u2018When one suffers some great hurt physically it causes shock and pain but slowly it\nmends the flesh heals the bone knits.",
    "There may be perhaps a little weakness a slight\nscar but nothing more.",
    "My husband M. Poirot suffered a great hurt mentally at his most\nsusceptible age.",
    "He adored his mother and he saw her die.",
    "He believed that his father was\nmorally responsible for that death.",
    "From that shock he has never quite recovered.",
    "His\nresentment against his father never died down.",
    "It was I who persuaded David to come\nhere this Christmas to be reconciled to his father.",
    "I wanted it\u2014for his sake\u2014I wanted that\nmental wound to heal.",
    "I realize now that coming here was a mistake.",
    "Simeon Lee amused\nhimself by probing into that old wound.",
    "It was\u2014a very dangerous thing to do...\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Are you telling me madame that your husband killed his father\u2019\n\u2018I am telling you M. Poirot that he easily might have done so... And I will also tell you\nthis\u2014that he did not When Simeon Lee was killed his son was playing the \u201cDead March\u201d.",
    "The wish to kill was in his heart.",
    "It passed out through his fingers and died in waves of\nsound\u2014that is the truth.\u2019\nPoirot was silent for a minute or two then he said \u2018And you madame what is your\nverdict on that past drama\u2019\n\u2018You mean the death of Simeon Lee\u2019s wife\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\nHilda said slowly \u2018I know enough of life to know that you can never judge any case on its\noutside merits.",
    "To all seeming Simeon Lee was entirely to blame and his wife was\n125\n\n\fabominably treated.",
    "At the same time I honestly believe that there is a kind of meekness\na predisposition to martyrdom which does arouse the worst instincts in men of a certain\ntype.",
    "Simeon Lee would have admired I think spirit and force of character.",
    "He was merely\nirritated by patience and tears.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said \u2018Your husband said last night \u201cMy mother never complained.\u201d Is\nthat true\u2019\nHilda Lee said impatiently \u2018Of course it isn\u2019t She complained the whole time to David\nShe laid the whole burden of her unhappiness on his shoulders.",
    "He was too young\u2014far\ntoo young to bear all she gave him to bear\u2019\nPoirot looked thoughtfully at her.",
    "She flushed under his gaze and bit her lip.",
    "He said \u2018I see.\u2019\nShe said sharply \u2018What do you see\u2019\nHe answered \u2018I see that you have had to be a mother to your husband when you would\nhave preferred to be a wife.\u2019\nShe turned away.",
    "At that moment David Lee came out of the house and along the terrace towards them.",
    "He said and his voice had a clear joyful note in it \u2018Hilda isn\u2019t it a glorious day Almost like\nspring instead of winter.\u2019\nHe came nearer.",
    "His head was thrown back a lock of fair hair fell across his forehead his\nblue eyes shone.",
    "He looked amazingly young and boyish.",
    "There was about him a youthful\neagerness a carefree radiance.",
    "Hercule Poirot caught his breath...\nDavid said \u2018Let\u2019s go down to the lake Hilda.\u2019\nShe smiled put her arm through his and they moved off together.",
    "As Poirot watched them go he saw her turn and give him a rapid glance.",
    "He caught a\nmomentary glimpse of swift anxiety\u2014or was it he wondered fear\nSlowly Hercule Poirot walked to the other end of the terrace.",
    "He murmured to himself \u2018As I have always said me I am the father confessor And since\nwomen come to confession more frequently than men it is women who have come to me\nthis morning.",
    "Will there I wonder be another very shortly\u2019\nAs he turned at the end of the terrace and paced back again he knew that his question\nwas answered.",
    "126\n\n\fLydia Lee was coming towards him.",
    "IV\nLydia said \u2018Good morning M. Poirot.",
    "Tressilian told me I should find you out here with\nHarry but I am glad to find you alone.",
    "My husband has been speaking about you.",
    "I know\nhe is very anxious to talk to you.\u2019\n\u2018Ah Yes Shall I go and see him now\u2019\n\u2018Not just yet.",
    "He got hardly any sleep last night.",
    "In the end I gave him a strong sleeping\ndraught.",
    "He is still asleep and I don\u2019t want to disturb him.\u2019\n\u2018I quite understand.",
    "That was very wise.",
    "I could see last night that the shock had been very\ngreat.\u2019\nShe said seriously \u2018You see M. Poirot he really cared\u2014much more than the others.\u2019\n\u2018I understand.\u2019\nShe asked \u2018Have you\u2014has the superintendent\u2014any idea of who can have done this awful\nthing\u2019\nPoirot said deliberately \u2018We have certain ideas madame as to who did not do it.\u2019\nLydia said almost impatiently \u2018It\u2019s like a nightmare\u2014so fantastic\u2014I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s real\u2019\nShe added \u2018What about Horbury Was he really at the cinema as he said\u2019\n\u2018Yes madame his story has been checked.",
    "He was speaking the truth.\u2019\nLydia stopped and plucked at a bit of yew.",
    "Her face went a little paler.",
    "She said \u2018But that\u2019s\nawful It only leaves\u2014the family\u2019\n\u2018Exactly.\u2019\n\u2018M.",
    "Poirot I can\u2019t believe it\u2019\n\u2018Madame you can and you do believe it\u2019\nShe seemed about to protest.",
    "Then suddenly she smiled ruefully.",
    "She said \u2018What a hypocrite one is\u2019\nHe nodded.",
    "\u2018If you were to be frank with me madame\u2019 he said \u2018you would admit that to you it seems\nquite natural that one of his family should murder your father\u2010in\u2010law.\u2019\n127\n\n\fLydia said sharply \u2018That\u2019s really a fantastic thing to say M. Poirot\u2019\n\u2018Yes it is.",
    "But your father\u2010in\u2010law was a fantastic person\u2019\nLydia said \u2018Poor old man.",
    "I can feel sorry for him now.",
    "When he was alive he just annoyed\nme unspeakably\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018So I should imagine\u2019\nHe bent over one of the stone sinks.",
    "\u2018They are very ingenious these.",
    "Very pleasing.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m glad you like them.",
    "It\u2019s one of my hobbies.",
    "Do you like this Arctic one with the\npenguins and the ice\u2019\n\u2018Charming.",
    "And this\u2014what is this\u2019\n\u2018Oh that\u2019s the Dead Sea\u2014or going to be.",
    "It isn\u2019t finished yet.",
    "You mustn\u2019t look at it.",
    "Now\nthis one is supposed to be Piana in Corsica.",
    "The rocks there you know are quite pink and\ntoo lovely where they go down into the blue sea.",
    "This desert scene is rather fun don\u2019t you\nthink\u2019\nShe led him along.",
    "When they had reached the farther end she glanced at her wrist\u2010watch.",
    "\u2018I must go and see if Alfred is awake.\u2019\nWhen she had gone Poirot went slowly back again to the garden representing the Dead\nSea.",
    "He looked at it with a good deal of interest.",
    "Then he scooped up a few of the pebbles\nand let them run through his fingers.",
    "Suddenly his face changed.",
    "He held up the pebbles close to his face.",
    "\u2018Sapristi\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018This is a surprise Now what exactly does this mean\u2019\n\n128\n\n\fPart 5\nDecember 26th\nThe chief constable and Superintendent Sugden stared at Poirot incredulously.",
    "The latter returned a stream of small pebbles carefully into a small cardboard box and\npushed it across to the chief constable.",
    "\u2018Oh yes\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018It is the diamonds all right.\u2019\n\u2018And you found them where did you say In the garden\u2019\n\u2018In one of the small gardens constructed by Madame Alfred Lee.\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Alfred\u2019 Sugden shook his head.",
    "\u2018Doesn\u2019t seem likely.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You mean I suppose that you do not consider it likely that Mrs Alfred cut her\nfather\u2010in\u2010law\u2019s throat\u2019\nSugden said quickly \u2018We know she didn\u2019t do that.",
    "I meant it seemed unlikely that she\npinched these diamonds.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018One would not easily believe her a thief\u2014no.\u2019\nSugden said \u2018Anybody could have hidden them there.\u2019\n\u2018That is true.",
    "It was convenient that in that particular garden\u2014the Dead Sea as it\nrepresents\u2014there happened to be pebbles very similar in shape and appearance.\u2019\nSugden said \u2018You mean she fixed it like that beforehand Ready\u2019\nColonel Johnson said warmly \u2018I don\u2019t believe it for a moment.",
    "Not for a moment.",
    "Why\nshould she take the diamonds in the first place\u2019\n\u2018Well as to that\u2014\u2019 Sugden said slowly.",
    "Poirot nipped in quickly \u2018There is a possible answer to that.",
    "She took the diamonds to\nsuggest a motive for the murder.",
    "That is to say she knew that murder was going to be\ndone though she herself took no active part in it.\u2019\nJohnson frowned.",
    "\u2018That won\u2019t hold water for a minute.",
    "You\u2019re making her out to be an accomplice\u2014but\nwhose accomplice would she be likely to be Only her husband\u2019s.",
    "But as we know that he\ntoo had nothing to do with the murder the whole theory falls to the ground.\u2019\n\n129\n\n\fSugden stroked his jaw reflectively.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 he said \u2018that\u2019s so.",
    "No if Mrs Lee took the diamonds\u2014and it\u2019s a big if\u2014it was just\nplain robbery and it\u2019s true she might have prepared that garden specially as a hiding\u2010place\nfor them till the hue and cry had died down.",
    "Another possibility is that of coincidence.",
    "That garden with its similarity of pebbles struck the thief whoever he or she was as an\nideal hiding\u2010place.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018That is quite possible.",
    "I am always prepared to admit one coincidence.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden shook his head dubiously.",
    "Poirot said \u2018What is your opinion Superintendent\u2019\nThe superintendent said cautiously \u2018Mrs Lee\u2019s a very nice lady.",
    "Doesn\u2019t seem likely that\nshe\u2019d be mixed up in any business that was fishy.",
    "But of course one never knows.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said testily \u2018In any case whatever the truth is about the diamonds her\nbeing mixed up in the murder is out of the question.",
    "The butler saw her in the drawing\u2010\nroom at the actual time of the crime.",
    "You remember that Poirot\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I had not forgotten that.\u2019\nThe chief constable turned to his subordinate.",
    "\u2018We\u2019d better get on.",
    "What have you to report Anything fresh\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "I\u2019ve got hold of some new information.",
    "To start with\u2014Horbury.",
    "There\u2019s a reason\nwhy he might be scared of the police.\u2019\n\u2018Robbery Eh\u2019\n\u2018No sir.",
    "Extorting money under threats.",
    "Modified blackmail.",
    "The case couldn\u2019t be proved\nso he got off but I rather fancy he\u2019s got away with a thing or two in that line.",
    "Having a\nguilty conscience he probably thought we were on to something of that kind when\nTressilian mentioned a police officer last night and it made him get the wind up.\u2019\nThe chief constable said \u2018H\u2019m So much for Horbury.",
    "What else\u2019\nThe superintendent coughed.",
    "\u2018Er\u2014Mrs George Lee sir.",
    "We\u2019ve got a line on her before her marriage.",
    "Was living with a\nCommander Jones.",
    "Passed as his daughter\u2014but she wasn\u2019t his daughter...",
    "I think from\nwhat we\u2019ve been told that old Mr Lee summed her up pretty correctly\u2014he was smart\nwhere women were concerned knew a bad lot when he saw one\u2014and was just amusing\nhimself by taking a shot in the dark.",
    "And he got her on the raw\u2019\n\n130\n\n\fColonel Johnson said thoughtfully \u2018That gives her another possible motive\u2014apart from\nthe money angle.",
    "She may have thought he knew something definite and was going to\ngive her away to her husband.",
    "That telephone story of hers is pretty fishy.",
    "She didn\u2019t\ntelephone.\u2019\nSugden suggested \u2018Why not have them in together sir and get at that telephone business\nstraight See what we get.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018Good idea.\u2019\nHe rang the bell.",
    "Tressilian answered it.",
    "\u2018Ask Mr and Mrs George Lee to come here.\u2019\n\u2018Very good sir.\u2019\nAs the old man turned away Poirot said \u2018The date on that wall calendar has it remained\nlike it is since the murder\u2019\nTressilian turned back.",
    "\u2018Which calendar sir\u2019\n\u2018The one on the wall over there.\u2019\nThe three men were sitting once more in Alfred Lee\u2019s small sitting\u2010room.",
    "The calendar in\nquestion was a large one with tear\u2010off leaves a bold date on each leaf.",
    "Tressilian peered across the room then shuffled slowly across till he was a foot or two\naway.",
    "He said \u2018Excuse me sir it has been torn off.",
    "It\u2019s the twenty\u2010sixth today.\u2019\n\u2018Ah pardon.",

    "Mr Alfred he\u2019s a very methodical gentleman.\u2019\n\u2018I see.",
    "Thank you.\u2019\nTressilian went out.",
    "Sugden said puzzled \u2018Is there anything fishy about that calendar Mr\nPoirot Have I missed something there\u2019\nWith a shrug of his shoulders Poirot said \u2018The calendar is of no importance.",
    "It was just a\nlittle experiment I was making.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018Inquest tomorrow.",
    "There\u2019ll be an adjournment of course.\u2019\n131\n\n\fSugden said \u2018Yes sir I\u2019ve seen the Coroner and it\u2019s all arranged for.\u2019\nII\nGeorge Lee came into the room accompanied by his wife.",
    "Colonel Johnson said \u2018Good morning.",
    "Sit down will you There are a few questions I want\nto ask both of you.",
    "Something I\u2019m not quite clear about.\u2019\n\u2018I shall be glad to give you any assistance I can\u2019 said George somewhat pompously.",
    "Magdalene said faintly \u2018Of course\u2019\nThe chief constable gave a slight nod to Sugden.",
    "The latter said \u2018About those telephone\ncalls on the night of the crime.",
    "You put through a call to Westeringham I think you said\nMr Lee\u2019\nGeorge said coldly \u2018Yes I did.",
    "To my agent in the constituency.",
    "I can refer you to him\nand\u2014\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden held up his hand to stem the flow.",
    "\u2018Quite so\u2014quite so Mr Lee.",
    "We\u2019re not disputing that point.",
    "Your call went through at 8.59\nexactly.\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2014I\u2014er\u2014couldn\u2019t say as to the exact time.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said Sugden.",
    "\u2018But we can We always check up on these things very carefully.",
    "Very\ncarefully indeed.",
    "The call was put through at 8.59 and it was terminated at 9.04.",
    "Your\nfather Mr Lee was killed about 9.15.",
    "I must ask you once more for an account of your\nmovements.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve told you\u2014I was telephoning\u2019\n\u2018No Mr Lee you weren\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense\u2014you must have made a mistake Well I may perhaps have just finished\ntelephoning\u2014I think I debated making another call\u2014was just considering whether it\nwas\u2014er\u2014worth\u2014the expense\u2014when I heard the noise upstairs.\u2019\n\u2018You would hardly debate whether or not to make a telephone call for ten minutes.\u2019\nGeorge went purple.",
    "He began to splutter.",
    "\u2018What do you mean What the devil do you mean Damned impudence Are you doubting\nmy word Doubting the word of a man of my position I\u2014er\u2014why should I have to\naccount for every minute of my time\u2019\n132\n\n\fSuperintendent Sugden said with a stolidness that Poirot admired \u2018It\u2019s usual.\u2019\nGeorge turned angrily on the chief constable.",
    "\u2018Colonel Johnson.",
    "Do you countenance this\u2014this unprecedented attitude\u2019\nThe chief constable said crisply \u2018In a murder case Mr Lee then questions must be\nasked\u2014and answered.\u2019\n\u2018I have answered them I had finished telephoning and was\u2014er\u2014debating a further call.\u2019\n\u2018You were in this room when the alarm was raised upstairs\u2019\n\u2018I was\u2014yes I was.\u2019\nJohnson turned to Magdalene.",
    "\u2018I think Mrs Lee\u2019 he said \u2018that you stated that you were telephoning when the alarm\nbroke out and that at the time you were alone in this room\u2019\nMagdalene was flustered.",
    "She caught her breath looked sideways at George\u2014at Sugden\nthen appealingly at Colonel Johnson.",
    "She said \u2018Oh really\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014I don\u2019t\nremember what I said...",
    "I was so upset...\u2019\nSugden said \u2018We\u2019ve got it all written down you know.\u2019\nShe turned her batteries on him\u2014wide appealing eyes\u2014quivering mouth.",
    "But she met in\nreturn the rigid aloofness of a man of stern respectability who didn\u2019t approve of her type.",
    "She said uncertainly \u2018I\u2014I\u2014of course I telephoned.",
    "I can\u2019t be quite sure just when\u2014\u2019\nShe stopped.",
    "George said \u2018What\u2019s all this Where did you telephone from Not in here.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said \u2018I suggest Mrs Lee that you didn\u2019t telephone at all.",
    "In that\ncase where were you and what were you doing\u2019\nMagdalene glanced distractedly about her and burst into tears.",
    "She sobbed \u2018George\ndon\u2019t let them bully me You know that if anyone frightens me and thunders questions at\nme I can\u2019t remember anything at all I\u2014I don\u2019t know what I was saying that night\u2014it was\nall so horrible\u2014and I was so upset\u2014and they\u2019re being so beastly to me...\u2019\nShe jumped up and ran sobbing out of the room.",
    "Springing up George Lee blustered \u2018What d\u2019you mean I won\u2019t have my wife bullied and\nfrightened out of her life She\u2019s very sensitive.",
    "It\u2019s disgraceful I shall have a question\n133\n\n\fasked in the House about the disgraceful bullying methods of the police.",
    "It\u2019s absolutely\ndisgraceful\u2019\nHe strode out of the room and banged the door.",
    "Superintendent Sugden threw his head back and laughed.",
    "He said \u2018We\u2019ve got them going properly Now we\u2019ll see\u2019\nJohnson said frowning \u2018Extraordinary business Looks fishy.",
    "We must get a further\nstatement out of her.\u2019\nSugden said easily \u2018Oh She\u2019ll be back in a minute or two.",
    "When she\u2019s decided what to\nsay.",
    "Eh Mr Poirot\u2019\nPoirot who had been sitting in a dream gave a start.",
    "\u2018Pardon\u2019\n\u2018I said she\u2019ll be back.\u2019\n\u2018Probably\u2014yes possibly\u2014oh yes\u2019\nSugden said staring at him \u2018What\u2019s the matter Mr Poirot Seen a ghost\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018You know\u2014I am not sure that I have not done just exactly that.\u2019\nColonel Johnson said impatiently \u2018Well Sugden anything else\u2019\nSugden said \u2018I\u2019ve been trying to check up on the order in which everyone arrived on the\nscene of the murder.",
    "It\u2019s quite clear what must have happened.",
    "After the murder when\nthe victim\u2019s dying cry had given the alarm the murderer slipped out locked the door with\npliers or something of that kind and a moment or two later became one of the people\nhurrying to the scene of the crime.",
    "Unfortunately it\u2019s not easy to check exactly whom\neveryone has seen because people\u2019s memories aren\u2019t very accurate on a point like that.",
    "Tressilian says he saw Harry and Alfred Lee cross the hall from the dining\u2010room and race\nupstairs.",
    "That lets them out but we don\u2019t suspect them anyway.",
    "As far as I can make out\nMiss Estravados got there late\u2014one of the last.",
    "The general idea seems to be that Farr\nMrs George and Mrs David were the first.",
    "Each of those three says one of the others was\njust ahead of them.",
    "That\u2019s what\u2019s so difficult you can\u2019t distinguish between a deliberate\nlie and a genuine haziness of recollection.",
    "Everybody ran there\u2014that\u2019s agreed but in what\norder they ran isn\u2019t so easy to get at.\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018You think that important\u2019\nSugden said \u2018It\u2019s the time element.",
    "The time remember was incredibly short.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I agree with you that the time element is very important in this case.\u2019\n134\n\n\fSugden went on \u2018What makes it more difficult is that there are two staircases.",
    "There\u2019s the\nmain one in the hall here about equidistant from the dining\u2010room and the drawing\u2010room\ndoors.",
    "Then there\u2019s one the other end of the house.",
    "Stephen Farr came up by the latter.",
    "Miss Estravados came along the upper landing from that end of the house her room is\nright the other end.",
    "The others say they went up by this one.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018It is a confusion yes.\u2019\nThe door opened and Magdalene came quickly in.",
    "She was breathing fast and had a bright\nspot of colour in each cheek.",
    "She came up to the table and said quietly \u2018My husband\nthinks I\u2019m lying down.",
    "I slipped out of my room quietly.",
    "Colonel Johnson\u2019 she appealed to\nhim with wide distressed eyes \u2018if I tell you the truth you will keep quiet about it won\u2019t\nyou I mean you don\u2019t have to make everything public\u2019\nColonel Johnson said \u2018You mean I take it Mrs Lee something that has no connection\nwith the crime\u2019\n\u2018Yes no connection at all.",
    "Just something in my\u2014my private life.\u2019\nThe chief constable said \u2018You\u2019d better make a clean breast of it Mrs Lee and leave us to\njudge.\u2019\nMagdalene said her eyes swimming \u2018Yes I will trust you.",
    "I know I can.",
    "You look so kind.",
    "You see it\u2019s like this.",
    "There\u2019s somebody\u2014\u2019 She stopped.",
    "\u2018Yes Mrs Lee\u2019\n\u2018I wanted to telephone to somebody last night\u2014a man\u2014a friend of mine and I didn\u2019t\nwant George to know about it.",
    "I know it was very wrong of me\u2014but well it was like that.",
    "So I went to telephone after dinner when I thought George would be safely in the dining\u2010\nroom.",
    "But when I got here I heard him telephoning so I waited.\u2019\n\u2018Where did you wait madame\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s a place for coats and things behind the stairs.",
    "It\u2019s dark there.",
    "I slipped back there\nwhere I could see George come out from this room.",
    "But he didn\u2019t come out and then all\nthe noise happened and Mr Lee screamed and I ran upstairs.\u2019\n\u2018So your husband did not leave this room until the moment of the murder\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\nThe chief constable said \u2018And you yourself from nine o\u2019clock to nine\u2010fifteen were waiting\nin the recess behind the stairs\u2019\n\u2018Yes but I couldn\u2019t say so you see They\u2019d want to know what I was doing there.",
    "It\u2019s been\nvery very awkward for me you do see that don\u2019t you\u2019\n135\n\n\fJohnson said dryly \u2018It was certainly awkward.\u2019\nShe smiled at him sweetly.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m so relieved to have told you the truth.",
    "And you won\u2019t tell my husband will you No\nI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t I can trust you all of you.\u2019\nShe included them all in her final pleading look then she slipped quickly out of the room.",
    "Colonel Johnson drew a deep breath.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018It might be like that It\u2019s a perfectly plausible story.",
    "On the other hand\u2014\u2019\n\u2018It might not\u2019 finished Sugden.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s just it.",
    "We don\u2019t know.\u2019\nIII\nLydia Lee stood by the far window of the drawing\u2010room looking out.",
    "Her figure was half\nhidden by the heavy window curtains.",
    "A sound in the room made her turn with a start to see Hercule Poirot standing by the\ndoor.",
    "She said \u2018You startled me M. Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018I apologize madame.",
    "I walk softly.\u2019\nShe said \u2018I thought it was Horbury.\u2019\nHercule Poirot nodded.",
    "\u2018It is true he steps softly that one\u2014like a cat\u2014or a thief.\u2019\nHe paused a minute watching her.",
    "Her face showed nothing but she made a slight grimace of distate as she said \u2018I have\nnever cared for that man.",
    "I shall be glad to get rid of him.\u2019\n\u2018I think you will be wise to do so madame.\u2019\nShe looked at him quickly.",
    "She said \u2018What do you mean Do you know anything against\nhim\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018He is a man who collects secrets\u2014and uses them to his advantage.\u2019\nShe said sharply \u2018Do you think he knows anything\u2014about the murder\u2019\n\n136\n\n\fPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said \u2018He has quiet feet and long ears.",
    "He may have\noverheard something that he is keeping to himself.\u2019\nLydia said clearly \u2018Do you mean that he may try to blackmail one of us\u2019\n\u2018It is within the bounds of possibility.",
    "But that is not what I came here to say.\u2019\n\u2018What did you come to say\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018I have been talking with M. Alfred Lee.",
    "He has made me a proposition\nand I wished to discuss it with you before accepting or declining it.",
    "But I was so struck by\nthe picture you made\u2014the charming pattern of your jumper against the deep red of the\ncurtains that I paused to admire.\u2019\nLydia said sharply \u2018Really M. Poirot must we waste time in compliments\u2019\n\u2018I beg your pardon madame.",
    "So few English ladies understand la toilette.",
    "The dress you\nwere wearing the first night I saw you its bold but simple pattern it had grace\u2014\ndistinction.\u2019\nLydia said impatiently \u2018What was it you wanted to see me about\u2019\nPoirot became grave.",
    "\u2018Just this madame.",
    "Your husband he wishes me to take up the investigation very\nseriously.",
    "He demands that I stay here in the house and do my utmost to get to the\nbottom of the matter.\u2019\nLydia said sharply \u2018Well\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018I should not wish to accept an invitation that was not endorsed by the\nlady of the house.\u2019\nShe said coldly \u2018Naturally I endorse my husband\u2019s invitation.\u2019\n\u2018Yes madame but I need more than that.",
    "Do you really want me to come here\u2019\n\u2018Why not\u2019\n\u2018Let us be more frank.",
    "What I ask you is this do you want the truth to come out or not\u2019\n\u2018Naturally.\u2019\nPoirot sighed.",
    "\u2018Must you return me these conventional replies\u2019\nLydia said \u2018I am a conventional woman.\u2019\n137\n\n\fThen she bit her lip hesitated and said \u2018Perhaps it is better to speak frankly.",
    "Of course I\nunderstand you The position is not a pleasant one.",
    "My father\u2010in\u2010law has been brutally\nmurdered and unless a case can be made out against the most likely suspect\u2014Horbury\u2014\nfor robbery and murder\u2014and it seems that it cannot\u2014then it comes to this\u2014one of his\nown family killed him.",
    "To bring that person to justice will mean bringing shame and\ndisgrace on us all...",
    "If I am to speak honestly I must say that I do not want this to happen.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You are content for the murderer to escape unpunished\u2019\n\u2018There are probably several undiscovered murderers at large in the world.\u2019\n\u2018That I grant you.\u2019\n\u2018Does one more matter then\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018And what about the other members of the family The innocent\u2019\nShe stared.",
    "\u2018What about them\u2019\n\u2018Do you realize that if it turns out as you hope no one will ever know.",
    "The shadow will\nremain on all alike...\u2019\nShe said uncertainly \u2018I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018No one will ever know who the guilty person is...\u2019\nHe added softly \u2018Unless you already know madame\u2019\nShe cried out \u2018You have no business to say that It\u2019s not true Oh If only it could be a\nstranger\u2014not a member of the family.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018It might be both.\u2019\nShe stared at him.",
    "\u2018What do you mean\u2019\n\u2018It might be a member of the family\u2014and at the same time a stranger... You do not see\nwhat I mean Eh bien it is an idea that has occurred to the mind of Hercule Poirot.\u2019\nHe looked at her.",
    "\u2018Well madame what am I to say to Mr Lee\u2019\nLydia raised her hands and let them fall in a sudden helpless gesture.",
    "138\n\n\fShe said \u2018Of course\u2014you must accept.\u2019\nIV\nPilar stood in the centre of the music\u2010room.",
    "She stood very straight her eyes darting from\nside to side like an animal who fears an attack.",
    "She said \u2018I want to get away from here\u2019\nStephen Farr said gently \u2018You\u2019re not the only one who feels like that.",
    "But they won\u2019t let us\ngo my dear.\u2019\n\u2018You mean\u2014the police\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\nPilar said very seriously \u2018It is not nice to be mixed up with the police.",
    "It is a thing that\nshould not happen to respectable people.\u2019\nStephen said with a faint smile \u2018Meaning yourself\u2019\nPilar said \u2018No I mean Alfred and Lydia and David and George and Hilda and\u2014yes\u2014\nMagdalene too.\u2019\nStephen lit a cigarette.",
    "He puffed at it for a moment or two before saying \u2018Why the\nexception\u2019\n\u2018What is that please\u2019\nStephen said \u2018Why leave out brother Harry\u2019\nPilar laughed her teeth showing white and even.",
    "\u2018Oh Harry is different I think he knows very well what it is to be mixed up with the police.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps you are right.",
    "He certainly is a little too picturesque to blend well into the\ndomestic picture.\u2019\nHe went on \u2018Do you like your English relations Pilar\u2019\nPilar said doubtfully \u2018They are kind\u2014they are all very kind.",
    "But they do not laugh much\nthey are not gay.\u2019\n\u2018My dear girl there\u2019s just been a murder in the house\u2019\n\u2018Y\u2010es\u2019 said Pilar doubtfully.",
    "139\n\n\f\u2018A murder\u2019 said Stephen instructively \u2018is not such an everyday occurrence as your\nnonchalance seems to imply.",
    "In England they take their murders seriously whatever they\nmay do in Spain.\u2019\nPilar said \u2018You are laughing at me...\u2019\nStephen said \u2018You\u2019re wrong.",
    "I\u2019m not in a laughing mood.\u2019\nPilar looked at him and said \u2018Because you too wish to get away from here\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018And the big handsome policeman will not let you go\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t asked him.",
    "But if I did I\u2019ve no doubt he\u2019d say no.",
    "I\u2019ve got to watch my step Pilar\nand be very very careful.\u2019\n\u2018That is tiresome\u2019 said Pilar nodding her head.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s just a little bit more than tiresome my dear.",
    "Then there\u2019s that lunatic foreigner\nprowling about.",
    "I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s any good but he makes me feel jumpy.\u2019\nPilar was frowning.",
    "She said \u2018My grandfather was very very rich was he not\u2019\n\u2018I should imagine so.\u2019\n\u2018Where does his money go to now To Alfred and the others\u2019\n\u2018Depends on his will.\u2019\nPilar said thoughtfully \u2018He might have left me some money but I am afraid that perhaps\nhe did not.\u2019\nStephen said kindly \u2018You\u2019ll be all right.",
    "After all you\u2019re one of the family.",
    "You belong here.",
    "They\u2019ll have to look after you.\u2019\nPilar said with a sigh \u2018I\u2014belong here.",
    "It is very funny that.",
    "And yet it is not funny at all.\u2019\n\u2018I can see that you mightn\u2019t find it very humorous.\u2019\nPilar sighed again.",
    "She said \u2018Do you think if we put on the gramophone we could dance\u2019\nStephen said dubiously \u2018It wouldn\u2019t look any too good.",
    "This is a house of mourning you\ncallous Spanish baggage.\u2019\nPilar said her big eyes opening very wide \u2018But I do not feel sad at all.",
    "Because I did not\nreally know my grandfather and though I liked to talk to him I do not want to cry and be\nunhappy because he is dead.",
    "It is very silly to pretend.\u2019\n140\n\n\fStephen said \u2018You\u2019re adorable\u2019\nPilar said coaxingly \u2018We could put some stockings and some gloves in the gramophone\nand then it would not make much noise and no one would hear.\u2019\n\u2018Come along then temptress.\u2019\nShe laughed happily and ran out of the room going along towards the ballroom at the far\nend of the house.",
    "Then as she reached the side passage which led to the garden door she stopped dead.",
    "Stephen caught up with her and stopped also.",
    "Hercule Poirot had unhooked a portrait from the wall and was studying it by the light from\nthe terrace.",
    "He looked up and saw them.",
    "\u2018Aha\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018You arrive at an opportune moment.\u2019\nPilar said \u2018What are you doing\u2019\nShe came and stood beside him.",
    "Poirot said gravely \u2018I am studying something very important the face of Simeon Lee when\nhe was a young man.\u2019\n\u2018Oh is that my grandfather\u2019\n\u2018Yes mademoiselle.\u2019\nShe stared at the painted face.",
    "She said slowly \u2018How different\u2014how very different...",
    "He\nwas so old so shrivelled up.",
    "Here he is like Harry like Harry might have been ten years\nago.\u2019\nHercule Poirot nodded.",
    "\u2018Yes mademoiselle.",
    "Harry Lee is very much the son of his father.",
    "Now here\u2014\u2019 He led her a\nlittle way along the gallery.",
    "\u2018Here is madame your grandmother\u2014a long gentle face very\nblonde hair mild blue eyes.\u2019\nPilar said \u2018Like David.\u2019\nStephen said \u2018Just a look of Alfred too.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018The heredity it is very interesting.",
    "Mr Lee and his wife were diametrically\nopposite types.",
    "On the whole the children of the marriage took after the mother.",
    "See\nhere mademoiselle.\u2019\n\n141\n\n\fHe pointed to a picture of a girl of nineteen or so with hair like spun gold and wide\nlaughing blue eyes.",
    "The colouring was that of Simeon Lee\u2019s wife but there was a spirit a\nvivacity that those mild blue eyes and placid features had never known.",
    "\u2018Oh\u2019 said Pilar.",
    "The colour came up in her face.",
    "Her hand went to her neck.",
    "She drew out a locket on a long gold chain.",
    "She pressed the\ncatch and it flew open.",
    "The same laughing face looked up at Poirot.",
    "\u2018My mother\u2019 said Pilar.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "On the opposite side of the locket was the portrait of a man.",
    "He was young\nand handsome with black hair and dark blue eyes.",
    "Poirot said \u2018Your father\u2019\nPilar said \u2018Yes my father.",
    "He is very beautiful is he not\u2019\n\u2018Yes indeed.",
    "Few Spaniards have blue eyes have they se\u00f1orita\u2019\n\u2018Sometimes in the North.",
    "Besides my father\u2019s mother was Irish.\u2019\nPoirot said thoughtfully \u2018So you have Spanish blood and Irish and English and a touch of\ngipsy too.",
    "Do you know what I think mademoiselle With that inheritance you should\nmake a bad enemy.\u2019\nStephen said laughing \u2018Remember what you said in the train Pilar That your way of\ndealing with your enemies would be to cut their throats.",
    "Oh\u2019\nHe stopped\u2014suddenly realizing the import of his words.",
    "Hercule Poirot was quick to lead the conversation away.",
    "He said \u2018Ah yes there was\nsomething se\u00f1orita I had to ask you.",
    "Your passport.",
    "It is needed by my friend the\nsuperintendent.",
    "There are you know police regulations\u2014very stupid very tiresome but\nnecessary\u2014for a foreigner in this country.",
    "And of course by law you are a foreigner.\u2019\nPilar\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "\u2018My passport Yes I will get it.",
    "It is in my room.\u2019\nPoirot said apologetically as he walked by her side \u2018I am most sorry to trouble you.",
    "I am\nindeed.\u2019\nThey had reached the end of the long gallery.",
    "Here was a flight of stairs.",
    "Pilar ran up and\nPoirot followed.",
    "Stephen came too.",
    "Pilar\u2019s bedroom was just at the head of the stairs.",
    "142\n\n\fShe said as she reached the door \u2018I will get it for you.\u2019\nShe went in.",
    "Poirot and Stephen Farr remained waiting outside.",
    "Stephen said remorsefully \u2018Damn\u2019 silly of me to say a thing like that.",
    "I don\u2019t think she\nnoticed though do you\u2019\nPoirot did not answer.",
    "He held his head a little on one side as though listening.",
    "He said \u2018The English are extraordinarily fond of fresh air.",
    "Miss Estravados must have\ninherited that characteristic.\u2019\nStephen said staring \u2018Why\u2019\nPoirot said softly \u2018Because though it is today extremely cold\u2014the black frost you call it\nnot like yesterday so mild and sunny Miss Estravados has just flung up her lower\nwindow\u2010sash.",
    "Amazing to love so much the fresh air.\u2019\nSuddenly there was an exclamation in Spanish from inside the room and Pilar reappeared\nlaughingly dismayed.",
    "\u2018Ah\u2019 she cried.",
    "\u2018But I am stupid\u2014and clumsy.",
    "My little case it was on the window\u2010sill and I\nwas sorting through it so quickly and very stupidly I knock my passport out of the window.",
    "It is down on the flower\u2010bed below.",
    "I will get it.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll get it\u2019 said Stephen but Pilar had flown past him and cried back over her shoulder\n\u2018No it was my stupidity.",
    "You go to the drawing\u2010room with M. Poirot and I will bring it to\nyou there.\u2019\nStephen Farr seemed inclined to go after her but Poirot\u2019s hand fell gently on his arm and\nPoirot\u2019s voice said \u2018Let us go this way.\u2019\nThey went along the first\u2010floor corridor towards the other end of the house until they got\nto the head of the main staircase.",
    "Here Poirot said \u2018Let us not go down for a minute.",
    "If\nyou will come with me to the room of the crime there is something I want to ask you.\u2019\nThey went along the corridor which led to Simeon Lee\u2019s room.",
    "On their left they passed an\nalcove which contained two marble statues stalwart nymphs clasping their draperies in an\nagony of Victorian propriety.",
    "Stephen Farr glanced at them and murmured \u2018Pretty frightful by daylight.",
    "I thought there\nwere three of them when I came along the other night but thank goodness there are only\ntwo\u2019\n\u2018They are not what is admired nowadays\u2019 admitted Poirot.",
    "\u2018But no doubt they cost much\nmoney in their time.",
    "They look better by night I think.\u2019\n\u2018Yes one sees only a white glimmering figure.\u2019\n143\n\n\fPoirot murmured \u2018All cats are grey in the dark\u2019\nThey found Superintendent Sugden in the room.",
    "He was kneeling by the safe and\nexamining it with a magnifying glass.",
    "He looked up as they entered.",
    "\u2018This was opened with the key all right\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018By someone who knew the combination.",
    "No sign of anything else.\u2019\nPoirot went up to him drew him aside and whispered something.",
    "The superintendent\nnodded and left the room.",
    "Poirot turned to Stephen Farr who was standing staring at the armchair in which Simeon\nLee always sat.",
    "His brows were drawn together and the veins showed in his forehead.",
    "Poirot looked at him for a minute or two in silence then he said \u2018You have the\nmemories\u2014yes\u2019\nStephen said slowly \u2018Two days ago he sat there alive\u2014and now...\u2019\nThen shaking off his absorption he said \u2018Yes M. Poirot you brought me here to ask me\nsomething\u2019\n\u2018Ah yes.",
    "You were I think the first person to arrive on the scene that night\u2019\n\u2018Was I I don\u2019t remember.",
    "No I think one of the ladies was here before me.\u2019\n\u2018Which lady\u2019\n\u2018One of the wives\u2014George\u2019s wife or David\u2019s\u2014I know they were both here pretty soon.\u2019\n\u2018You did not hear the scream I think you said\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I did.",
    "I can\u2019t quite remember.",
    "Somebody did cry out but that may have been\nsomeone downstairs.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You did not hear a noise like this\u2019\nHe threw his head back and suddenly gave vent to a piercing yell.",
    "It was so unexpected that Stephen started backwards and nearly fell over.",
    "He said angrily\n\u2018For the Lord\u2019s sake do you want to scare the whole house No I didn\u2019t hear anything in\nthe least like that You\u2019ll have the whole place by the ears again They\u2019ll think another\nmurder has happened\u2019\nPoirot looked crestfallen.",
    "He murmured \u2018True... it was foolish... We must go at once.\u2019\nHe hurried out of the room.",
    "Lydia and Alfred were at the foot of the stairs peering up\u2014\nGeorge came out of the library to join them and Pilar came running a passport held in her\nhand.",
    "144\n\n\fPoirot cried \u2018It is nothing\u2014nothing.",
    "Do not be alarmed.",
    "A little experiment that I make.",
    "That was all.\u2019\nAlfred looked annoyed and George indignant.",
    "Poirot left Stephen to explain and he\nhurriedly slipped away along the passage to the other end of the house.",
    "At the end of the passage Superintendent Sugden came quietly out of Pilar\u2019s door and met\nPoirot.",
    "\u2018Eh bien\u2019 asked Poirot.",
    "The superintendent shook his head.",
    "\u2018Not a sound.\u2019\nHis eyes met Poirot\u2019s appreciatively and he nodded.",
    "V\nAlfred Lee said \u2018Then you accept M. Poirot\u2019\nHis hand as it went to his mouth shook slightly.",
    "His mild brown eyes were alight with a\nnew and feverish expression.",
    "He stammered slightly in his speech.",
    "Lydia standing silently\nby looked at him with some anxiety.",
    "Alfred said \u2018You don\u2019t know\u2014you c\u2010c\u2010can\u2019t imagine\u2014what it m\u2010m\u2010means to me... My\nfather\u2019s murderer must be f\u2010f\u2010found.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Since you have assured me that you have reflected long and carefully\u2014yes I\naccept.",
    "But you comprehend Mr Lee there can be no drawing back.",
    "I am not the dog one\nsets on to hunt and then recalls because you do not like the game he puts up\u2019\n\u2018Of course... of course... Everything is ready.",
    "Your bedroom is prepared.",
    "Stay as long as you\nlike\u2014\u2019\nPoirot said gravely \u2018It will not be long.\u2019\n\u2018Eh What\u2019s that\u2019\n\u2018I said it will not be long.",
    "There is in this crime such a restricted circle that it cannot\npossibly take long to arrive at the truth.",
    "Already I think the end draws near.\u2019\nAlfred stared at him \u2018Impossible\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Not at all.",
    "The facts all point more or less clearly in one direction.",
    "There is just some\nirrelevant matter to be cleared out of the way.",
    "When this is done the truth will appear.\u2019\nAlfred said incredulously \u2018You mean you know\u2019\n145\n\n\fPoirot smiled.",
    "\u2018Oh yes\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I know.\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018My father\u2014my father\u2014\u2019 He turned away.",
    "Poirot said briskly \u2018There are M. Lee two requests that I have to make.\u2019\nAlfred said in a muffled voice \u2018Anything\u2014anything.\u2019\n\u2018Then in the first place I would like the portrait of M. Lee as a young man placed in the\nbedroom you are good enough to allot to me.\u2019\nAlfred and Lydia stared at him.",
    "The former said \u2018My father\u2019s portrait\u2014but why\u2019\nPoirot said with a wave of the hand \u2018It will\u2014how shall I say\u2014inspire me.\u2019\nLydia said sharply \u2018Do you propose M. Poirot to solve a crime by clairvoyance\u2019\n\u2018Let us say madame that I intend to use not only the eyes of the body but the eyes of the\nmind.\u2019\nShe shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Poirot continued \u2018Next M. Lee I should like to know of the true circumstances attending\nthe death of your sister\u2019s husband Juan Estravados.\u2019\nLydia said \u2018Is that necessary\u2019\n\u2018I want all the facts madame.\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018Juan Estravados as the result of a quarrel about a woman killed another man\nin a caf\u00e9.\u2019\n\u2018How did he kill him\u2019\nAlfred looked appealingly at Lydia.",
    "She said evenly \u2018He stabbed him.",
    "Juan Estravados was\nnot condemned to death as there had been provocation.",
    "He was sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment and died in prison.\u2019\n\u2018Does his daughter know about her father\u2019\n\u2018I think not.\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018No Jennifer never told her.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you.\u2019\n146\n\n\fLydia said \u2018You don\u2019t think that Pilar\u2014Oh it\u2019s absurd\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Now M. Lee will you give me some facts about your brother M. Harry Lee\u2019\n\u2018What do you want to know\u2019\n\u2018I understand that he was considered somewhat of a disgrace to the family.",
    "Why\u2019\nLydia said \u2018It is so long ago...\u2019\nAlfred said the colour coming up in his face \u2018If you want to know M. Poirot he stole a\nlarge sum of money by forging my father\u2019s name to a cheque.",
    "Naturally my father didn\u2019t\nprosecute.",
    "Harry\u2019s always been crooked.",
    "He\u2019s been in trouble all over the world.",
    "Always\ncabling for money to get out of a scrape.",
    "He\u2019s been in and out of gaol here there and\neverywhere.\u2019\nLydia said \u2018You don\u2019t really know all this Alfred.\u2019\nAlfred said angrily his hands shaking \u2018Harry\u2019s no good\u2014no good whatever He never has\nbeen\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018There is I see no love lost between you\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018He victimized my father\u2014victimized him shamefully\u2019\nLydia sighed\u2014a quick impatient sigh.",
    "Poirot heard it and gave her a sharp glance.",
    "She said \u2018If only those diamonds could be found.",
    "I\u2019m sure the solution lies there.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018They have been found madame.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019\nPoirot said gently \u2018They were found in your little garden of the Dead Sea...\u2019\nLydia cried \u2018In my garden How\u2014how extraordinary\u2019\nPoirot said softly \u2018Is it not madame\u2019\n\n147\n\n\f148\n\n\fPart 6\nDecember 27th\nAlfred Lee said with a sigh \u2018That was better than I feared\u2019\nThey had just returned from the inquest.",
    "Mr Charlton an old\u2010fashioned type of solicitor with a cautious blue eye had been present\nand had returned with them.",
    "He said \u2018Ah\u2014I told you the proceedings would be purely formal\u2014purely formal\u2014there\nwas bound to be an adjournment\u2014to enable the police to gather up additional evidence.\u2019\nGeorge Lee said vexedly \u2018It is all most unpleasant\u2014really most unpleasant\u2014a terrible\nposition in which to be placed I myself am quite convinced that this crime was done by a\nmaniac who somehow or other gained admittance to the house.",
    "That man Sugden is as\nobstinate as a mule.",
    "Colonel Johnson should enlist the aid of Scotland Yard.",
    "These local\npolice are no good.",
    "Thick\u2010headed.",
    "What about this man Horbury for instance I hear his\npast is definitely unsatisfactory but the police do nothing whatever about it.\u2019\nMr Charlton said \u2018Ah\u2014I believe the man Horbury has a satisfactory alibi covering the\nperiod of time in question.",
    "The police have accepted it.\u2019\n\u2018Why should they\u2019 George fumed.",
    "\u2018If I were they I should accept such an alibi with\nreserve\u2014with great reserve.",
    "Naturally a criminal always provides himself with an alibi It\nis the duty of the police to break down the alibi\u2014that is if they know their job.\u2019\n\u2018Well well\u2019 said Mr Charlton.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite our business to teach the police their\njobs eh Pretty competent body of men on the whole.\u2019\nGeorge shook his head darkly.",
    "\u2018Scotland Yard should be called in.",
    "I\u2019m not at all satisfied with Superintendent Sugden\u2014he\nmay be painstaking\u2014but he is certainly far from brilliant.\u2019\nMr Charlton said \u2018I don\u2019t agree with you you know.",
    "Sugden\u2019s a good man.",
    "Doesn\u2019t throw\nhis weight about but he gets there.\u2019\nLydia said \u2018I\u2019m sure the police are doing their best.",
    "Mr Charlton will you have a glass of\nsherry\u2019\nMr Charlton thanked her politely but declined.",
    "Then clearing his throat he proceeded to the reading of the will all members of the\nfamily being assembled.",
    "149\n\n\fHe read it with a certain relish lingering over its more obscure phraseology and savouring\nits legal technicalities.",
    "He came to the end took off his glasses wiped them and looked round on the assembled\ncompany inquiringly.",
    "Harry Lee said \u2018All this legal stuff\u2019s a bit hard to follow.",
    "Give us the bare bones of it will\nyou\u2019\n\u2018Really\u2019 said Mr Charlton.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s a perfectly simple will.\u2019\nHarry said \u2018My God what\u2019s a difficult will like then\u2019\nMr Charlton rebuked him with a cold glance.",
    "He said \u2018The main provisions of the will are\nquite simple.",
    "Half Mr Lee\u2019s property goes to his son Mr Alfred Lee the remainder is\ndivided between his other children.\u2019\nHarry laughed unpleasantly.",
    "He said \u2018As usual Alfred\u2019s struck lucky Half my father\u2019s\nfortune Lucky dog aren\u2019t you Alfred\u2019\nAlfred flushed.",
    "Lydia said sharply \u2018Alfred was a loyal and devoted son to his father.",
    "He\u2019s\nmanaged the works for years and has had all the responsibility.\u2019\nHarry said \u2018Oh yes Alfred was always the good boy.\u2019\nAlfred said sharply \u2018You may consider yourself lucky I think Harry that my father left you\nanything at all\u2019\nHarry laughed throwing his head back.",
    "He said \u2018You\u2019d have liked it better if he\u2019d cut me\nright out wouldn\u2019t you You\u2019ve always disliked me.\u2019\nMr Charlton coughed.",
    "He was used\u2014only too well used\u2014to the painful scenes that\nsucceeded the reading of a will.",
    "He was anxious to get away before the usual family\nquarrel got too well under way.",
    "He murmured \u2018I think\u2014er\u2014that that is all that I need\u2014er\u2014\u2019\nHarry said sharply \u2018What about Pilar\u2019\nMr Charlton coughed again this time apologetically.",
    "\u2018Er\u2014Miss Estravados is not mentioned in the will.\u2019\nHarry said Doesn\u2019t she get her mother\u2019s share\u2019\nMr Charlton explained.",
    "150\n\n\f\u2018Sen\u02dcora Estravados if she had lived would of course have received an equal share with\nthe rest of you but as she is dead the portion that would have been hers goes back into\nthe estate to be shared out between you.\u2019\nPilar said slowly in her rich Southern voice \u2018Then\u2014I have\u2014nothing\u2019\nLydia said quickly \u2018My dear the family will see to that of course.\u2019\nGeorge Lee said \u2018You will be able to make your home here with Alfred\u2014eh Alfred We\u2014\ner\u2014you are our niece\u2014it is our duty to look after you.\u2019\nHilda said \u2018We shall always be glad to have Pilar with us.\u2019\nHarry said \u2018She ought to have her proper share.",
    "She ought to have Jennifer\u2019s whack.\u2019\nMr Charlton murmured \u2018Must really\u2014er\u2014be going.",
    "Goodbye Mrs Lee\u2014anything I can\ndo\u2014er\u2014consult me at any time...\u2019\nHe escaped quickly.",
    "His experience enabled him to predict that all the ingredients for a\nfamily row were present.",
    "As the door shut behind him Lydia said in her clear voice \u2018I agree with Harry.",
    "I think Pilar is\nentitled to a definite share.",
    "This will was made many years before Jennifer\u2019s death.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense\u2019 said George.",
    "\u2018Very slipshod and illegal way of thinking Lydia.",
    "The law\u2019s the\nlaw.",
    "We must abide by it.\u2019\nMagdalene said \u2018It\u2019s hard luck of course and we\u2019re all very sorry for Pilar but George is\nright.",
    "As he says the law is the law.\u2019\nLydia got up.",
    "She took Pilar by the hand.",
    "\u2018My dear\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018This must be very unpleasant for you.",
    "Will you please leave us while\nwe discuss the question\u2019\nShe led the girl to the door.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t worry Pilar dear\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Leave it to me.\u2019\nPilar went slowly out of the room.",
    "Lydia shut the door behind her and turned back.",
    "There was a moment\u2019s pause while everyone drew breath and in another moment the\nbattle was in full swing.",

    "David said with sudden violence \u2018Must we have all this disgraceful fuss over money\u2019\nMagdalene said venomously to him \u2018It\u2019s all very well to be so high\u2010minded.",
    "You\u2019re not\ngoing to refuse your legacy are you You want money just as much as the rest of us do\nAll this unworldliness is just a pose\u2019\nDavid said in a strangled voice \u2018You think I ought to refuse it I wonder\u2014\u2019\nHilda said sharply \u2018Of course you oughtn\u2019t.",
    "Must we all behave like children Alfred\nyou\u2019re the head of the family\u2014\u2019\nAlfred seemed to wake out of a dream.",

    "She\u2019s not a Lee remember.",

    "He would have allotted her at least her\nmother\u2019s share.",
    "It is possible that he might have done much more than that.",
    "She was the\nonly grandchild remember.",
    "I think the least we can do is to endeavour to remedy any\ninjustice that your father himself was preparing to remedy.\u2019\nAlfred said warmly \u2018Well put Lydia I was wrong.",
    "I agree with you that Pilar must be given\nJennifer\u2019s share of my father\u2019s fortune.\u2019\n152\n\n\fLydia said \u2018Your turn Harry.\u2019\nHarry said \u2018As you know I agree.",
    "I think Lydia has put the case very well and I\u2019d like to say\nI admire her for it.\u2019\nLydia said \u2018George\u2019\nGeorge was red in the face.",
    "He spluttered \u2018Certainly not Whole thing\u2019s preposterous\nGive her a home and a decent dress allowance.",
    "Quite enough for her\u2019\n\u2018Then you refuse to co\u2010operate\u2019 asked Alfred.",
    "\u2018Yes I do.\u2019\n\u2018And he\u2019s quite right\u2019 said Magdalene.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s disgraceful to suggest he should do anything of\nthe kind Considering that George is the only member of the family who has done\nanything in the world I think it\u2019s a shame his father left him so little\u2019\nLydia said \u2018David\u2019\nDavid said vaguely \u2018Oh I think you\u2019re right.",
    "It\u2019s a pity there\u2019s got to be so much ugliness\nand disputing about it all.\u2019\nHilda said \u2018You\u2019re quite right Lydia.",
    "It\u2019s only justice\u2019\nHarry looked round.",
    "He said \u2018Well that\u2019s clear.",
    "Of the family Alfred myself and David are\nin favour of the motion.",
    "George is against it.",
    "The ayes have it.\u2019\nGeorge said sharply \u2018There is no question of ayes and noes.",
    "My share of my father\u2019s\nestate is mine absolutely.",
    "I shall not part with a penny of it.\u2019\n\u2018No indeed\u2019 said Magdalene.",
    "Lydia said sharply \u2018If you like to stand out that is your business.",
    "The rest of us will make\nup your share of the total.\u2019\nShe looked round for assent and the others nodded.",
    "Harry said \u2018Alfred\u2019s got the lion\u2019s share.",
    "He ought to stand most of the racket.\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018I see that your original disinterested suggestion will soon break down.\u2019\nHilda said firmly \u2018Don\u2019t let\u2019s start again Lydia shall tell Pilar what we\u2019ve decided.",
    "We can\nsettle details later.\u2019 She added in the hope of making a diversion \u2018I wonder where Mr Farr\nis and M. Poirot\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018We dropped Poirot in the village on our way to the inquest.",
    "He said he had an\nimportant purchase to make.\u2019\n153\n\n\fHarry said \u2018Why didn\u2019t he go to the inquest Surely he ought to have done\u2019\nLydia said \u2018Perhaps he knew it was not going to be important.",
    "Who\u2019s that out there in the\ngarden Superintendent Sugden or Mr Farr\u2019\nThe efforts of the two women were successful.",
    "The family conclave broke up.",
    "Lydia said to Hilda privately \u2018Thank you Hilda.",
    "It was nice of you to back me up.",
    "You\nknow you really have been a comfort in all this.\u2019\nHilda said thoughtfully \u2018Queer how money upsets people.\u2019\nThe others had all left the room.",
    "The two women were alone.",
    "Lydia said \u2018Yes\u2014even Harry\u2014although it was his suggestion And my poor Alfred\u2014he is\nso British\u2014he doesn\u2019t really like Lee money going to a Spanish subject.\u2019\nHilda said smiling \u2018Do you think we women are more unworldly\u2019\nLydia said with a shrug of her graceful shoulders \u2018Well you know it isn\u2019t really our\nmoney\u2014not our own That may make a difference.\u2019\nHilda said thoughtfully \u2018She is a strange child\u2014Pilar I mean.",
    "I wonder what will become of\nher\u2019\nLydia sighed.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m glad that she will be independent.",
    "To live here to be given a home and a dress\nallowance would not I think be very satisfactory to her.",
    "She\u2019s too proud and I think\ntoo\u2014too alien.\u2019\nShe added musingly \u2018I once brought some beautiful blue lapis home from Egypt.",
    "Out\nthere against the sun and the sand it was a glorious colour\u2014a brilliant warm blue.",
    "But\nwhen I got it home the blue of it hardly showed any more.",
    "It was just a dull darkish string\nof beads.\u2019\nHilda said \u2018Yes I see...\u2019\nLydia said gently \u2018I am so glad to come to know you and David at last.",
    "I\u2019m glad you both\ncame here.\u2019\nHilda sighed \u2018How often I\u2019ve wished in the last few days that we hadn\u2019t\u2019\n\u2018I know.",
    "You must have done...",
    "But you know Hilda the shock hasn\u2019t affected David nearly\nas badly as it might have done.",
    "I mean he is so sensitive that it might have upset him\ncompletely.",
    "Actually since the murder he\u2019s seemed ever so much better\u2014\u2019\n\n154\n\n\fHilda looked slightly disturbed.",
    "She said \u2018So you\u2019ve noticed that It\u2019s rather dreadful in a\nway...",
    "But oh Lydia it\u2019s undoubtedly so\u2019\nShe was silent a minute recollecting words that her husband had spoken only the night\nbefore.",
    "He had said to her eagerly his fair hair tossed back from his forehead \u2018Hilda you\nremember in Tosca\u2014when Scarpia is dead and Tosca lights the candles at his head and\nfeet Do you remember what she says \u2018Now I can forgive him...\u2019 That is what I feel\u2014\nabout Father.",
    "I see now that all these years I couldn\u2019t forgive him and yet I really wanted\nto...",
    "But no\u2014now there\u2019s no rancour any more.",
    "It\u2019s all wiped away.",
    "And I feel\u2014oh I feel as\nthough a great load had been lifted from my back.\u2019\nShe had said striving to fight back a sudden fear \u2018Because he\u2019s dead\u2019\nHe had answered quickly stammering in his eagerness \u2018No no you don\u2019t understand.",
    "Not\nbecause he is dead but because my childish stupid hate of him is dead...\u2019\nHilda thought of those words now.",
    "She would have liked to repeat them to the woman at her side but she felt instinctively\nthat it was wiser not.",
    "She followed Lydia out of the drawing\u2010room into the hall.",
    "Magdalene was there standing by the hall table with a little parcel in her hand.",
    "She\njumped when she saw them.",
    "She said \u2018Oh this must be M Poirot\u2019s important purchase.",
    "I\nsaw him put it down here just now.",
    "I wonder what it is.\u2019\nShe looked from one to the other of them giggling a little but her eyes were sharp and\nanxious belying the affected gaiety of her words.",
    "Lydia\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "She said \u2018I must go and wash before lunch.\u2019\nMagdalene said still with that affectation of childishness but unable to keep the\ndesperate note out of her voice \u2018I must just peep\u2019\nShe unrolled the piece of paper and gave a sharp exclamation.",
    "She stared at the thing in\nher hand.",
    "Lydia stopped and Hilda too.",
    "Both women stared.",
    "Magdalene said in a puzzled voice \u2018It\u2019s a false moustache.",
    "But\u2014but\u2014why\u2019\nHilda said doubtfully \u2018Disguise But\u2014\u2019\nLydia finished the sentence for her.",
    "\u2018But M. Poirot has a very fine moustache of his own\u2019\n155\n\n\fMagdalene was wrapping the parcel up again.",
    "She said \u2018I don\u2019t understand.",
    "It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s mad.",
    "Why does M. Poirot buy a false moustache\u2019\nII\nWhen Pilar left the drawing\u2010room she walked slowly along the hall.",
    "Stephen Farr was\ncoming in through the garden door.",
    "He said \u2018Well Is the family conclave over Has the\nwill been read\u2019\nPilar said her breath coming fast \u2018I have got nothing\u2014nothing at all It was a will made\nmany years ago.",
    "My grandfather left money to my mother but because she is dead it does\nnot go to me but goes back to them.\u2019\nStephen said \u2018That seems rather hard lines.\u2019\nPilar said \u2018If that old man had lived he would have made another will.",
    "He would have left\nmoney to me\u2014a lot of money Perhaps in time he would have left me all the money\u2019\nStephen said smiling \u2018That wouldn\u2019t have been very fair either would it\u2019\n\u2018Why not He would have liked me best that is all.\u2019\nStephen said \u2018What a greedy child you are.",
    "A real little gold\u2010digger.\u2019\nPilar said soberly \u2018The world is very cruel to women.",
    "They must do what they can for\nthemselves\u2014while they are young.",
    "When they are old and ugly no one will help them.\u2019\nStephen said slowly \u2018That\u2019s more true than I like to think.",
    "But it isn\u2019t quite true.",
    "Alfred Lee\nfor instance was genuinely fond of his father in spite of the old man being thoroughly\ntrying and exacting.\u2019\nPilar\u2019s chin went up.",
    "\u2018Alfred\u2019 she said \u2018is rather a fool.\u2019\nStephen laughed.",
    "Then he said \u2018Well don\u2019t worry lovely Pilar.",
    "The Lees are bound to look after you you\nknow.\u2019\nPilar said disconsolately \u2018It will not be very amusing that.\u2019\nStephen said slowly \u2018No I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t.",
    "I can\u2019t see you living here Pilar.",
    "Would you\nlike to come to South Africa\u2019\nPilar nodded.",
    "156\n\n\fStephen said \u2018There\u2019s sun there and space.",
    "There\u2019s hard work too.",
    "Are you good at work\nPilar\u2019\nPilar said doubtfully \u2018I do not know.\u2019\nHe said \u2018You\u2019d rather sit on a balcony and eat sweets all day long And grow enormously\nfat and have three double chins\u2019\nPilar laughed and Stephen said \u2018That\u2019s better.",
    "I\u2019ve made you laugh.\u2019\nPilar said \u2018I thought I should laugh this Christmas In books I have read that an English\nChristmas is very gay that one eats burning raisins and there is a plum pudding all in\nflames and something that is called a Yule log.\u2019\nStephen said \u2018Ah but you must have a Christmas uncomplicated by murder.",
    "Come in here\na minute.",
    "Lydia took me in here yesterday.",
    "It\u2019s her store\u2010room.\u2019\nHe led her into a small room little bigger than a cupboard.",
    "\u2018Look Pilar boxes and boxes of crackers and preserved fruits and oranges and dates and\nnuts.",
    "And here\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 Pilar clasped her hands.",
    "\u2018They are pretty these gold and silver balls.\u2019\n\u2018Those were to hang on a tree with presents for the servants.",
    "And here are little snowmen\nall glittering with frost to put on the dinner table.",
    "And here are balloons of every colour all\nready to blow up\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 Pilar\u2019s eyes shone.",
    "\u2018Oh can we blow one up Lydia would not mind.",
    "I do love\nballoons.\u2019\nStephen said \u2018Baby Here which will you have\u2019\nPilar said \u2018I will have a red one.\u2019\nThey selected their balloons and blew their cheeks distended.",
    "Pilar stopped blowing to\nlaugh and her balloon went down again.",
    "She said \u2018You look so funny\u2014blowing\u2014with your cheeks puffed out.\u2019\nHer laugh rang out.",
    "Then she fell to blowing industriously.",
    "They tied up their balloons\ncarefully and began to play with them patting them upwards sending them to and fro.",
    "Pilar said \u2018Out in the hall there would be more room.\u2019\nThey were sending the balloons to each other and laughing when Poirot came along the\nhall.",
    "He regarded them indulgently.",
    "157\n\n\f\u2018So you play les jeux d\u2019enfants It is pretty that\u2019\nPilar said breathlessly \u2018Mine is the red one.",
    "It is bigger than his.",
    "Much bigger.",
    "If we took it\noutside it would go right up in the sky.\u2019\n\u2018Let\u2019s send them up and wish\u2019 said Stephen.",
    "\u2018Oh yes that is a good idea.\u2019\nPilar ran to the garden door Stephen followed.",
    "Poirot came behind still looking indulgent.",
    "\u2018I will wish for a great deal of money\u2019 announced Pilar.",
    "She stood on tiptoe holding the string of the balloon.",
    "It tugged gently as a puff of wind\ncame.",
    "Pilar let go and it floated along taken by the breeze.",
    "Stephen laughed.",
    "\u2018You mustn\u2019t tell your wish.\u2019\n\u2018No Why not\u2019\n\u2018Because it doesn\u2019t come true.",
    "Now I\u2019m going to wish.\u2019\nHe released his balloon.",
    "But he was not so lucky.",
    "It floated sideways caught on a holly\nbush and expired with a bang.",
    "Pilar ran to it.",
    "She announced tragically \u2018It is gone...\u2019\nThen as she stirred the little limp wisp of rubber with her toe she said \u2018So that was what\nI picked up in Grandfather\u2019s room.",
    "He too had had a balloon only his was a pink one.\u2019\nPoirot gave a sharp exclamation.",
    "Pilar turned inquiringly.",
    "Poirot said \u2018It is nothing.",
    "I stabbed\u2014no stubbed\u2014the toe.\u2019\nHe wheeled round and looked at the house.",
    "He said \u2018So many windows A house mademoiselle has its eyes\u2014and its ears.",
    "It is indeed\nregrettable that the English are so fond of open windows.\u2019\nLydia came out on the terrace.",
    "She said \u2018Lunch is just ready.",
    "Pilar my dear everything has\nbeen settled quite satisfactorily.",
    "Alfred will explain the exact details to you after lunch.",
    "Shall we come in\u2019\nThey went into the house.",
    "Poirot came last.",
    "He was looking grave.",
    "158\n\n\fIII\nLunch was over.",
    "As they came out of the dining\u2010room Alfred said to Pilar \u2018Will you come into my room\nThere is something I want to talk over with you.\u2019\nHe led her across the hall and into his study shutting the door after him.",
    "The others went\non into the drawing\u2010room.",
    "Only Hercule Poirot remained in the hall looking thoughtfully at\nthe closed study door.",
    "He was aware suddenly of the old butler hovering uneasily near him.",
    "Poirot said \u2018Yes Tressilian what is it\u2019\nThe old man seemed troubled.",
    "He said \u2018I wanted to speak to Mr Lee.",
    "But I don\u2019t like to\ndisturb him now.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Something has occurred\u2019\nTressilian said slowly \u2018It\u2019s such a queer thing.",
    "It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019\n\u2018Tell me\u2019 said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Tressilian hesitated.",
    "Then he said \u2018Well it\u2019s this sir.",
    "You may have noticed that each side\nof the front door there was a cannon ball.",
    "Big heavy stone things.",
    "Well sir one of them\u2019s\ngone.\u2019\nHercule Poirot\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "He said \u2018Since when\u2019\n\u2018They were both there this morning sir.",
    "I\u2019ll take my oath on that.\u2019\n\u2018Let me see.\u2019\nTogether they went outside the front door.",
    "Poirot bent and examined the remaining\ncannon ball.",
    "When he straightened himself his face was very grave.",
    "Tressilian quavered \u2018Who\u2019d want to steal a thing like that sir It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I do not like it.",
    "I do not like it at all...\u2019\nTressilian was watching him anxiously.",
    "He said slowly \u2018What\u2019s come to the house sir\nEver since the master was murdered it doesn\u2019t seem like the same place.",
    "I feel the whole\ntime as though I was going about in a dream.",
    "I mix things up and I sometimes feel I can\u2019t\ntrust my own eyes.\u2019\nHercule Poirot shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018You are wrong.",
    "Your own eyes are just what you\nmust trust.\u2019\n159\n\n\fTressilian said shaking his head \u2018My sight\u2019s bad\u2014I can\u2019t see like I used to do.",
    "I get things\nmixed up\u2014and people.",
    "I\u2019m getting too old for my work.\u2019\nHercule Poirot clapped him on the shoulder and said \u2018Courage.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you sir.",
    "You mean it kindly I know.",
    "But there it is I am too old.",
    "I\u2019m always going\nback to the old days and the old faces.",
    "Miss Jenny and Master David and Master Alfred.",
    "I\u2019m always seeing them as young gentlemen and ladies.",
    "Ever since that night when Mr\nHarry came home\u2014\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 he said \u2018that is what I thought.",
    "You said just now \u201cEver since the master was\nmurdered\u201d\u2014but it began before that.",
    "It is ever since Mr Harry came home is it not that\nthings have altered and seemed unreal\u2019\nThe butler said \u2018You\u2019re quite right sir.",
    "It was then.",
    "Mr Harry always brought trouble into\nthe house even in the old days.\u2019\nHis eyes wandered back to the empty stone base.",
    "\u2018Who can have taken it sir\u2019 he whispered.",
    "\u2018And why It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s like a madhouse.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018It is not madness I am afraid of.",
    "It is sanity Somebody Tressilian is in\ngreat danger.\u2019\nHe turned and re\u2010entered the house.",
    "At that moment Pilar came out from the study.",
    "A red spot shone on either cheek.",
    "She held\nher head high and her eyes glittered.",
    "As Poirot came up to her she suddenly stamped her foot and said \u2018I will not take it.\u2019\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.",
    "He said \u2018What is it that you will not take mademoiselle\u2019\nPilar said \u2018Alfred has just told me that I am to have my mother\u2019s share of the money my\ngrandfather left.\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019\n\u2018I could not get it by law he said.",
    "But he and Lydia and the others consider it should be\nmine.",
    "They say it is a matter of justice.",
    "And so they will hand it over to me.\u2019\nPoirot said again \u2018Well\u2019\nPilar stamped once more with her foot.",
    "\u2018Do you not understand They are giving it to me\u2014giving it to me.\u2019\n160\n\n\f\u2018Need that hurt your pride Since what they say is true\u2014that it should in justice be yours\u2019\nPilar said \u2018You do not understand...\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018On the contrary\u2014I understand very well.\u2019\n\u2018Oh...\u2019 She turned away pettishly.",
    "There was a ring at the bell.",
    "Poirot glanced over his shoulder.",
    "He saw the silhouette of\nSuperintendent Sugden outside the door.",
    "He said hurriedly to Pilar \u2018Where are you\ngoing\u2019\nShe said sulkily \u2018To the drawing\u2010room.",
    "To the others.\u2019\nPoirot said quickly \u2018Good.",
    "Stay with them there.",
    "Do not wander about the house alone\nespecially after dark.",
    "Be on your guard.",
    "You are in great danger mademoiselle.",
    "You will\nnever be in greater danger than you are today.\u2019\nHe turned away from her and went to meet Sugden.",
    "The latter waited till Tressilian had gone back into his pantry.",
    "Then he shoved a cable form under Poirot\u2019s nose.",
    "\u2018Now we\u2019ve got it\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Read that.",
    "It\u2019s from the South African Police.\u2019\nThe cable said \u2018Ebenezer Farr\u2019s only son died two years ago.\u2019\nSugden said \u2018So now we know Funny\u2014I was on a different tack altogether...\u2019\nIV\nPilar marched into the drawing\u2010room her head held high.",
    "She went straight up to Lydia who was sitting in the window with some knitting.",
    "Pilar said \u2018Lydia I have come to tell you that I will not take that money.",
    "I am going away\u2014\nat once...\u2019\nLydia looked astonished.",
    "She laid down her knitting.",
    "She said \u2018My dear child Alfred must\nhave explained very badly It is not in the least a matter of charity if that is what you feel.",
    "Really it is not a question of kindness or generosity on our part.",
    "It is a plain matter of right\nand wrong.",
    "In the ordinary course of events your mother would have inherited this\nmoney and you would have come into it from her.",
    "It is your right\u2014your blood right.",
    "It is a\nmatter not of charity but of justice\u2019\nPilar said fiercely \u2018And that is why I cannot do it\u2014not when you speak like that\u2014not\nwhen you are like that I enjoyed coming here.",
    "It was fun It was an adventure but now\n161\n\n\fyou have spoilt it all I am going away now at once\u2014you will never be bothered by me\nagain...\u2019\nTears choked her voice.",
    "She turned and ran blindly out of the room.",
    "Lydia stared.",
    "She said helplessly \u2018I\u2019d no idea she would take it like that\u2019\nHilda said \u2018The child seems quite upset.\u2019\nGeorge cleared his throat and said portentously \u2018Er\u2014as I pointed out this morning\u2014the\nprinciple involved is wrong.",
    "Pilar has the wit to see that for herself.",
    "She refuses to accept\ncharity\u2014\u2019\nLydia said sharply \u2018It is not charity.",
    "It is her right\u2019\nGeorge said \u2018She does not seem to think so\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden and Hercule Poirot came in.",
    "The former looked round and asked\n\u2018Where\u2019s Mr Farr I want a word with him.\u2019\nBefore anyone had time to answer Hercule Poirot said sharply \u2018Where is the se\u00f1orita\nEstravados\u2019\nGeorge Lee said with a trace of malicious satisfaction \u2018Going to clear out so she says.",
    "Apparently she has had enough of her English relations.\u2019\nPoirot wheeled round.",
    "He said to Sugden \u2018Come\u2019\nAs the two men emerged into the hall there was the sound of a heavy crash and a far\u2010\naway shriek.",
    "Poirot cried \u2018Quick... Come...\u2019\nThey raced along the hall and up the far staircase.",
    "The door of Pilar\u2019s room was open and a\nman stood in the doorway.",
    "He turned his head as they ran up.",
    "It was Stephen Farr.",
    "He said \u2018She\u2019s alive...\u2019\nPilar stood crouched against the wall of her room.",
    "She was staring at the floor where a big\nstone cannon ball was lying.",
    "She said breathlessly \u2018It was on top of my door balanced there.",
    "It would have crashed\ndown on my head when I came in but my skirt caught on a nail and jerked me back just as\nI was coming in.\u2019\nPoirot knelt down and examined the nail.",
    "162\n\n\fOn it was a thread of purple tweed.",
    "He looked up and nodded gravely.",
    "\u2018That nail mademoiselle\u2019 he said \u2018saved your life.\u2019\nThe superintendent said bewildered \u2018Look here what\u2019s the meaning of all this\u2019\nPilar said \u2018Someone tried to kill me\u2019\nShe nodded her head several times.",
    "Superintendent Sugden glanced up at the door.",
    "\u2018Booby trap\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018An old\u2010fashioned booby trap\u2014and its purpose was murder That\u2019s\nthe second murder planned in this house.",
    "But this time it didn\u2019t come off\u2019\nStephen Farr said huskily \u2018Thank God you\u2019re safe.\u2019\nPilar flung out her hands in a wide appealing gesture.",
    "\u2018Madre de Dios\u2019 she cried.",
    "\u2018Why should anyone wish to kill me What have I done\u2019\nHercule Poirot said slowly \u2018You should rather ask mademoiselle what do I know\u2019\nShe stared.",
    "\u2018Know I do not know anything.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018That is where you are wrong.",
    "Tell me Mademoiselle Pilar where\nwere you at the time of the murder You were not in this room.\u2019\n\u2018I was.",
    "I have told you so\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said with deceptive mildness \u2018Yes but you weren\u2019t speaking the\ntruth when you said that you know.",
    "You told us you heard your grandfather scream\u2014you\ncouldn\u2019t have heard that if you were in here\u2014Mr Poirot and I tested that yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 Pilar caught her breath.",
    "Poirot said \u2018You were somewhere very much nearer his room.",
    "I will tell you where I think\nyou were mademoiselle.",
    "You were in the recess with the statues quite close to your\ngrandfather\u2019s door.\u2019\nPilar said startled \u2018Oh... How did you know\u2019\nPoirot said with a faint smile \u2018Mr Farr saw you there.\u2019\nStephen said sharply \u2018I did not.",
    "That\u2019s an absolute lie\u2019\n163\n\n\fPoirot said \u2018I ask your pardon Mr Farr but you did see her.",
    "Remember your impression\nthat there were three statues in that recess not two.",
    "Only one person wore a white dress\nthat night Mademoiselle Estravados.",
    "She was the third white figure you saw.",
    "That is so is\nit not mademoiselle\u2019\nPilar said after a moment\u2019s hesitation \u2018Yes it is true.\u2019\nPoirot said gently \u2018Now tell us mademoiselle the whole truth.",
    "Why were you there\u2019\nPilar said \u2018I left the drawing\u2010room after dinner and I thought I would go and see my\ngrandfather.",
    "I thought he would be pleased.",
    "But when I turned into the passage I saw\nsomeone else was there at his door.",
    "I did not want to be seen because I knew my\ngrandfather had said he did not want to see anyone that night.",
    "I slipped into the recess in\ncase the person at the door turned round.\u2019\n\u2018Then all at once I heard the most horrible sounds tables\u2014chairs\u2019\u2014she waved her\nhands\u2014\u2018everything falling and crashing.",
    "I did not move.",
    "I do not know why.",
    "I was\nfrightened.",
    "And then there was a terrible scream\u2019\u2014she crossed herself\u2014\u2018and my heart it\nstopped beating and I said \u201cSomeone is dead...\u201d\u2019\n\u2018And then\u2019\n\u2018And then people began coming running along the passage and I came out at the end and\njoined them.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said sharply \u2018You said nothing of all this when we first questioned\nyou.",
    "Why not\u2019\nPilar shook her head.",
    "She said with an air of wisdom \u2018It is not good to tell too much to the police.",
    "I thought\nyou see that if I said I was near there you might think that I had killed him.",
    "So I said I was\nin my room.\u2019\nSugden said sharply \u2018If you tell deliberate lies all that it ends in is that you\u2019re bound to\ncome under suspicion.\u2019\nStephen Farr said \u2018Pilar\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018Who did you see standing at the door when you turned into the passage Tell us.\u2019\nSugden said \u2018Yes tell us.\u2019\nFor a moment the girl hesitated.",
    "Her eyes opened then narrowed.",
    "She said slowly \u2018I don\u2019t know who it was.",
    "It was too dimly lit to see.",
    "But it was a woman...\u2019\n164\n\n\fV\nSuperintendent Sugden looked round at the circle of faces.",
    "He said with something as\nnear irritation as he had yet shown \u2018This is very irregular Mr Poirot.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018It is a little idea of mine.",
    "I wish to share with everyone the knowledge that I\nhave acquired.",
    "I shall then invite their co\u2010operation and so we shall get at the truth.\u2019\nSugden murmured under his breath \u2018Monkey tricks.\u2019\nHe leaned back in his chair.",
    "Poirot said \u2018To begin with you have I think an explanation to\nask of Mr Farr.\u2019\nSugden\u2019s mouth tightened.",
    "\u2018I should have chosen a less public moment\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018However I\u2019ve no objection.\u2019 He\nhanded the cable to Stephen Farr.",
    "\u2018Now Mr Farr as you call yourself perhaps you can\nexplain this\u2019\nStephen Farr took it.",
    "Raising his eyebrows he read it slowly out loud.",
    "Then with a bow he\nhanded it back to the superintendent.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s pretty damning isn\u2019t it\u2019\nSugden said \u2018Is that all you\u2019ve got to say about it You quite understand there is no\nobligation on you to make a statement\u2014\u2019\nStephen Farr interrupted.",
    "He said \u2018You needn\u2019t caution me Superintendent.",
    "I can see it\ntrembling on your tongue Yes I\u2019ll give you an explanation.",
    "It\u2019s not a very good one but\nit\u2019s the truth.\u2019\nHe paused.",
    "Then he began \u2018I\u2019m not Ebenezer Farr\u2019s son.",
    "But I knew both father and son\nquite well.",
    "Now try and put yourself in my place.",
    "My name is Stephen Grant by the way.",
    "I arrived in this country for the first time in my life.",
    "I was disappointed.",
    "Everything and\neverybody seemed drab and lifeless.",
    "Then I was travelling by train and I saw a girl.",
    "I\u2019ve got\nto say it straight out I fell for that girl She was the loveliest and most unlikely creature in\nthe world I talked to her for a while in the train and I made up my mind then and there\nnot to lose sight of her.",
    "As I was leaving the compartment I caught sight of the label on her\nsuitcase.",
    "Her name meant nothing to me but the address to which she was travelling did.",
    "I\u2019d heard of Gorston Hall and I knew all about its owner.",
    "He was Ebenezer Farr\u2019s one\u2010time\npartner and old Eb often talked about him and said what a personality he was.",
    "\u2018Well the idea came to me to go to Gorston Hall and pretend I was Eb\u2019s son.",
    "He had died\nas this cable says two years ago but I remembered old Eb saying that he had not heard\nfrom Simeon Lee now for many years and I judged that Lee would not know of the death\nof Eb\u2019s son.",
    "Anyway I felt it was worth trying.\u2019\n\n165\n\n\fSugden said \u2018You didn\u2019t try it on at once though.",
    "You stayed in the King\u2019s Arms at\nAddlesfield for two days.\u2019\nStephen said \u2018I was thinking it over\u2014whether to try it or not.",
    "At last I made up my mind I\nwould.",
    "It appealed to me as a bit of an adventure.",
    "Well it worked like a charm The old\nman greeted me in the friendliest manner and at once asked me to come and stay in the\nhouse.",
    "I accepted.",
    "There you are Superintendent there\u2019s my explanation.",
    "If you don\u2019t\nfancy it cast your mind back to your courting days and see if you don\u2019t remember some\nbit of foolishness you indulged in then.",
    "As for my real name as I say it\u2019s Stephen Grant.",
    "You can cable to South Africa and check up on me but I\u2019ll tell you this you\u2019ll find I\u2019m a\nperfectly respectable citizen.",
    "I\u2019m not a crook or a jewel thief.\u2019\nPoirot said softly \u2018I never believed you were.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden stroked his jaw cautiously.",
    "He said \u2018I\u2019ll have to check up on that\nstory.",
    "What I\u2019d like to know is this Why didn\u2019t you come clean after the murder instead of\ntelling us a pack of lies\u2019\nStephen said disarmingly \u2018Because I was a fool I thought I could get away with it I\nthought it would look fishy if I admitted to being here under a false name.",
    "If I hadn\u2019t been\na complete idiot I would have realized you were bound to cable to Jo\u2019burg.\u2019\nSugden said \u2018Well Mr Farr\u2014er\u2014Grant\u2014I\u2019m not saying I disbelieve your story.",
    "It will be\nproved or disproved soon enough.\u2019\nHe looked across inquiringly at Poirot.",
    "The latter said \u2018I think Miss Estravados has\nsomething to say.\u2019\nPilar had gone very white.",
    "She said in a breathless voice \u2018It is true.",
    "I would never have\ntold you but for Lydia and the money.",
    "To come here and pretend and cheat and act\u2014that\nwas fun but when Lydia said the money was mine and that it was only justice that was\ndifferent it was not fun any longer.\u2019\nAlfred Lee said with a puzzled face \u2018I do not understand my dear what you are talking\nabout.\u2019\nPilar said \u2018You think I am your niece Pilar Estravados But that is not so Pilar was killed\nwhen I was travelling with her in a car in Spain.",
    "A bomb came and it hit the car and she\nwas killed but I was not touched.",
    "I did not know her very well but she had told me all\nabout herself and how her grandfather had sent for her to go to England and that he was\nvery rich.",
    "And I had no money at all and I did not know where to go or what to do.",
    "And I\nthought suddenly \u201cWhy should not I take Pilar\u2019s passport and go to England and become\nvery rich\u201d\u2019 Her face lit up with its sudden wide smile.",
    "\u2018Oh it was fun wondering if I could\nget away with it Our faces on the photograph were not unlike.",
    "But when they wanted my\npassport here I opened the window and threw it out and ran down to get it and then I\nrubbed some earth just over the face a little because at a barrier travelling they do not\nlook very closely but here they might\u2014\u2019\n166\n\n\fAlfred Lee said angrily \u2018Do you mean to say that you represented yourself to my father as\nhis granddaughter and played on his affection for you\u2019\nPilar nodded.",
    "She said complacently \u2018Yes I saw at once I could make him like me very\nmuch.\u2019\nGeorge Lee broke out \u2018Preposterous\u2019 he spluttered.",
    "\u2018Criminal Attempting to get money\nby false pretences.\u2019\nHarry Lee said \u2018She didn\u2019t get any from you old boy Pilar I\u2019m on your side I\u2019ve got a\nprofound admiration for your daring.",
    "And thank goodness I\u2019m not your uncle any more\nThat gives me a much freer hand.\u2019\nPilar said to Poirot \u2018You knew When did you know\u2019\nPoirot smiled \u2018Mademoiselle if you have studied the laws of Mendel you would know\nthat two blue\u2010eyed people are not likely to have a brown\u2010eyed child.",
    "Your mother was I\nwas sure a most chaste and respectable lady.",
    "It followed then that you were not Pilar\nEstravados at all.",
    "When you did your trick with the passport I was quite sure of it.",
    "It was\ningenious but not you understand quite ingenious enough.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said unpleasantly \u2018The whole thing\u2019s not quite ingenious enough.\u2019\nPilar stared at him.",
    "She said \u2018I don\u2019t understand...\u2019\nSugden said \u2018You\u2019ve told us a story\u2014but I think there\u2019s a good deal more you haven\u2019t\ntold.\u2019\nStephen said \u2018You leave her alone\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden took no notice.",
    "He went on \u2018You\u2019ve told us that you went up to\nyour grandfather\u2019s room after dinner.",
    "You said it was an impulse on your part.",
    "I\u2019m going to\nsuggest something else.",
    "It was you who stole those diamonds.",
    "You\u2019d handled them.",
    "On\noccasion perhaps you\u2019d put them away in the safe and the old man hadn\u2019t watched you\ndo it When he found the stones were missing he saw at once that only two people could\nhave taken them.",
    "One was Horbury who might have got to know the combination and\nhave crept in and stolen them during the night.",
    "The other person was you.\u2019\n\u2018Well Mr Lee at once took measures.",
    "He rang me up and had me come to see him.",
    "Then\nhe sent word to you to come and see him immediately after dinner.",
    "You did so and he\naccused you of the theft.",
    "You denied it he pressed the charge.",
    "I don\u2019t know what\nhappened next\u2014perhaps he tumbled to the fact that you weren\u2019t his granddaughter but\na very clever little professional thief.",
    "Anyway the game was up exposure loomed over\nyou and you slashed at him with a knife.",
    "There was a struggle and he screamed.",
    "You were\nproperly up against it then.",
    "You hurried out of the room turned the key from the outside\nand then knowing you could not get away before the others came you slipped into the\nrecess by the statues.\u2019\n167\n\n\fPilar cried shrilly \u2018It is not true It is not true I did not steal the diamonds I did not kill\nhim.",
    "I swear it by the Blessed Virgin.\u2019\nSugden said sharply \u2018Then who did You say you saw a figure standing outside Mr Lee\u2019s\ndoor.",
    "According to your story that person must have been the murderer.",
    "No one else\npassed the recess But we\u2019ve only your word for it that there was a figure there at all.",
    "In\nother words you made that up to exculpate yourself\u2019\nGeorge Lee said sharply \u2018Of course she\u2019s guilty It\u2019s all clear enough I always said an\noutsider killed my father Preposterous nonsense to pretend one of his family would do a\nthing like that It\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be natural\u2019\nPoirot stirred in his seat.",
    "He said \u2018I disagree with you.",
    "Taking into consideration the\ncharacter of Simeon Lee it would be a very natural thing to happen.\u2019\n\u2018Eh\u2019 George\u2019s jaw dropped.",
    "He stared at Poirot.",
    "Poirot went on \u2018And in my opinion that very thing did happen.",
    "Simeon Lee was killed by\nhis own flesh and blood for what seemed to the murderer a very good and sufficient\nreason.\u2019\nGeorge cried \u2018One of us I deny\u2014\u2019\nPoirot\u2019s voice broke in hard as steel.",
    "\u2018There is a case against every person here.",
    "We will Mr George Lee begin with the case\nagainst you.",
    "You had no love for your father You kept on good terms with him for the\nsake of money.",
    "On the day of his death he threatened to cut down your allowance.",
    "You\nknew that on his death you would probably inherit a very substantial sum.",
    "There is the\nmotive.",
    "After dinner you went as you say to telephone.",
    "You did telephone\u2014but the call\nlasted only five minutes.",
    "After that you could easily have gone to your father\u2019s room\nchatted with him and then attacked him and killed him.",
    "You left the room and turned the\nkey from outside for you hoped the affair would be put down to a burglar.",
    "You omitted in\nyour panic to make sure that the window was fully open so as to support the burglar\ntheory.",
    "That was stupid but you are if you will pardon my saying so rather a stupid man\u2019\n\u2018However\u2019 said Poirot after a brief pause during which George tried to speak and failed\n\u2018many stupid men have been criminals\u2019\nHe turned his eyes on Magdalene.",
    "\u2018Madame too she also had a motive.",
    "She is I think in debt and the tone of certain of\nyour father\u2019s remarks may\u2014have caused her uneasiness.",
    "She too has no alibi.",
    "She went\nto telephone but she did not telephone and we have only her word for what she did\ndo...\u2019\n\u2018Then\u2019 he paused \u2018there is Mr David Lee.",
    "We have heard not once but many times of the\nrevengeful tempers and long memories that went with the Lee blood.",
    "Mr David Lee did\n168\n\n\fnot forget or forgive the way his father had treated his mother.",
    "A final jibe directed at the\ndead lady may have been the last straw.",
    "David Lee is said to have been playing the piano\nat the time of the murder.",
    "By a coincidence he was playing the \u201cDead March\u201d.",
    "But\nsuppose somebody else was playing that \u201cDead March\u201d somebody who knew what he\nwas going to do and who approved his action\u2019\nHilda Lee said quietly \u2018That is an infamous suggestion.\u2019\nPoirot turned to her.",
    "\u2018I will offer you another madame.",
    "It was your hand that did the\ndeed.",
    "It was you who crept upstairs to execute judgment on a man you considered beyond\nhuman forgiveness.",
    "You are of those madame who can be terrible in anger...\u2019\nHilda said \u2018I did not kill him.\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said brusquely \u2018Mr Poirot\u2019s quite right.",
    "There is a possible case\nagainst everyone except Mr Alfred Lee Mr Harry Lee and Mrs Alfred Lee.\u2019\nPoirot said gently \u2018I should not even except those three...\u2019\nThe superintendent protested \u2018Oh come now Mr Poirot\u2019\nLydia Lee said \u2018And what is the case against me M. Poirot\u2019\nShe smiled a little as she spoke her brows raised ironically.",
    "Poirot bowed.",
    "He said \u2018Your motive madame I pass over.",
    "It is sufficiently obvious.",
    "As to\nthe rest you were wearing last night a flowered taffeta dress of a very distinctive pattern\nwith a cape.",
    "I will remind you of the fact that Tressilian the butler is short\u2010sighted.",
    "Objects at a distance are dim and vague to him.",
    "I will also point out that your drawing\u2010\nroom is big and lighted by heavily shaded lamps.",
    "On that night a minute or two before the\ncries were heard Tressilian came into the drawing\u2010room to take away the coffee\u2010cups.",
    "He\nsaw you as he thought in a familiar attitude by the far window half concealed by the\nheavy curtains.\u2019\nLydia Lee said \u2018He did see me.\u2019\nPoirot went on \u2018I suggest that it is possible that what Tressilian saw was the cape of your\ndress arranged to show by the window curtain as though you yourself were standing\nthere.\u2019\nLydia said \u2018I was standing there...\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018How dare you suggest\u2014\u2019\nHarry interrupted him.",
    "\u2018Let him go on Alfred.",
    "It\u2019s our turn next.",
    "How do you suggest that dear Alfred killed his\nbeloved father since we were both together in the dining\u2010room at the time\u2019\n169\n\n\fPoirot beamed at him.",
    "\u2018That\u2019 he said \u2018is very simple.",
    "An alibi gains in force accordingly as it is unwillingly given.",
    "You and your brother are on bad terms.",
    "It is well known.",
    "You jibe at him in public.",
    "He has\nnot a good word to say for you But supposing that were all part of a very clever plot.",
    "Supposing that Alfred Lee is tired of dancing attendance upon an exacting taskmaster.",
    "Supposing that you and he have got together some time ago.",
    "Your plan is laid.",
    "You come\nhome.",
    "Alfred appears to resent your presence.",
    "He shows jealousy and dislike of you.",
    "You\nshow contempt for him.",
    "And then comes the night of the murder you have so cleverly\nplanned together.",
    "One of you remains in the dining\u2010room talking and perhaps quarrelling\naloud as though two people were there.",
    "The other goes upstairs and commits the crime...\u2019\nAlfred sprang to his feet.",
    "\u2018You devil\u2019 he said.",
    "His voice was inarticulate.",
    "Sugden was staring at Poirot.",
    "He said \u2018Do you really mean\u2014\u2019\nPoirot said with a sudden ring of authority in his voice \u2018I have had to show you the\npossibilities These are the things that might have happened Which of them actually did\nhappen we can only tell by passing from the outside appearance to the inside reality...\u2019\nHe paused and then said slowly \u2018We must come back as I said before to the character of\nSimeon Lee himself...\u2019\nVI\nThere was a momentary pause.",
    "Strangely enough all indignation and all rancour had died\ndown.",
    "Hercule Poirot held his audience under the spell of his personality.",
    "They watched\nhim fascinated as he began slowly to speak.",
    "\u2018It is all there you see.",
    "The dead man is the focus and centre of the mystery We must\nprobe deep into the heart and mind of Simeon Lee and see what we find there.",
    "For a man\ndoes not live and die to himself alone.",
    "That which he has he hands on\u2014to those who\ncome after him...\u2019\n\u2018What had Simeon Lee to bequeath to his sons and daughter Pride to begin with\u2014a\npride which in the old man was frustrated in his disappointment over his children.",
    "Then\nthere was the quality of patience.",
    "We have been told that Simeon Lee waited patiently for\nyears in order to revenge himself upon someone who had done him an injury.",
    "We see that\nthat aspect of his temperament was inherited by the son who resembled him least in face.",
    "David Lee also could remember and continue to harbour resentment through long years.",
    "In face Harry Lee was the only one of his children who closely resembled him.",
    "That\nresemblance is quite striking when we examine the portrait of Simeon Lee as a young\nman.",
    "There is the same high\u2010bridged aquiline nose the long sharp line of the jaw the\nbackward poise of the head.",
    "I think too that Harry inherited many of his father\u2019s\nmannerisms\u2014that habit for instance of throwing back his head and laughing and\nanother habit of drawing his finger along the line of his jaw.\u2019\n170\n\n\f\u2018Bearing all these things in mind and being convinced that the murder was committed by\na person closely connected with the dead man I studied the family from the psychological\nstandpoint.",
    "That is I tried to decide which of them were psychologically possible criminals.",
    "And in my judgment only two persons qualified in that respect.",
    "They were Alfred Lee and\nHilda Lee David\u2019s wife.",
    "David himself I rejected as a possible murderer.",
    "I do not think a\nperson of his delicate susceptibilities could have faced the actual bloodshed of a cut\nthroat.",
    "George Lee and his wife I likewise rejected.",
    "Whatever their desires I did not think\nthey had the temperament to take a risk.",
    "They were both essentially cautious.",
    "Mrs Alfred\nLee I felt sure was quite incapable of an act of violence.",
    "She has too much irony in her\nnature.",
    "About Harry Lee I hesitated.",
    "He had a certain coarse truculence of aspect but I\nwas nearly sure that Harry Lee in spite of his bluff and his bluster was essentially a\nweakling.",
    "That I now know was also his father\u2019s opinion.",
    "Harry he said was worth no\nmore than the rest.",
    "That left me with two people I have already mentioned.",
    "Alfred Lee\nwas a person capable of a great deal of selfless devotion.",
    "He was a man who had\ncontrolled and subordinated himself to the will of another for many years.",
    "It was always\npossible under these conditions for something to snap.",
    "Moreover he might quite possibly\nhave harboured a secret grudge against his father which might gradually have grown in\nforce through never being expressed in any way.",
    "It is the quietest and meekest people\nwho are often capable of the most sudden and unexpected violence for the reason that\nwhen their control does snap it does so entirely The other person I considered was\ncapable of the crime was Hilda Lee.",
    "She is the kind of individual who is capable on\noccasions of taking the law into her own hands\u2014though never through selfish motives.",
    "Such people judge and also execute.",
    "Many Old Testament characters are of this type.",
    "Jael\nand Judith for example.\u2019\n\u2018And now having got so far I examined the circumstances of the crime itself.",
    "And the first\nthing that arises\u2014that strikes one in the face as it were\u2014is the extraordinary conditions\nunder which that crime took place Take your minds back to that room where Simeon Lee\nlay dead.",
    "If you remember there was both a heavy table and a heavy chair overturned a\nlamp crockery glasses etc.",
    "But the chair and the table were especially surprising.",
    "They\nwere of solid mahogany.",
    "It was hard to see how any struggle between that frail old man\nand his opponent could result in so much solid furniture being overturned and knocked\ndown.",
    "The whole thing seemed unreal.",
    "And yet surely no one in their senses would stage\nsuch an effect if it had not really occurred\u2014unless possibly Simeon Lee had been killed by\na powerful man and the idea was to suggest that the assailant was a woman or somebody\nof weak physique.\u2019\n\u2018But such an idea was unconvincing in the extreme since the noise of the furniture would\ngive the alarm and the murderer would thereby have very little time to make his exit.",
    "It\nwould surely be to anyone\u2019s advantage to cut Simeon Lee\u2019s throat as quietly as possible.\u2019\n\u2018Another extraordinary point was the turning of the key in the lock from the outside.",
    "Again there seemed no reason for such a proceeding.",
    "It could not suggest suicide since\nnothing in the death itself accorded with suicide.",
    "It was not to suggest escape through the\nwindows\u2014for those windows were so arranged that escape that way was impossible\nMoreover once again it involved time.",
    "Time which must be precious to the murderer\u2019\n\u2018There was one other incomprehensible thing\u2014a piece of rubber cut from Simeon Lee\u2019s\nspongebag and a small wooden peg shown to me by Superintendent Sugden.",
    "These had\n171\n\n\fbeen picked up from the floor by one of the persons who first entered the room.",
    "There\nagain\u2014these things did not make sense They meant exactly nothing at all Yet they had\nbeen there.\u2019\n\u2018The crime you perceive is becoming increasingly incomprehensible.",
    "It has no order no\nmethod\u2014enfin it is not reasonable.\u2019\n\u2018And now we come to a further difficulty.",
    "Superintendent Sugden was sent for by the dead\nman a robbery was reported to him and he was asked to return an hour and a half later.",
    "Why If it is because Simeon Lee suspected his granddaughter or some other member of\nthe family why does he not ask Superintendent Sugden to wait downstairs while he has\nhis interview straight away with the suspected party With the superintendent actually in\nthe house his lever over the guilty person would have been much stronger.\u2019\n\u2018So now we arrive at the point where not only the behaviour of the murderer is\nextraordinary but the behaviour of Simeon Lee also is extraordinary\u2019\n\u2018And I say to myself \u201cThis thing is all wrong\u201d Why Because we are looking at it from the\nwrong angle.",
    "We are looking at it from the angle that the murderer wants us to look at\nit...\u2019\n\u2018We have three things that do not make sense the struggle the turned key and the snip\nof rubber.",
    "But there must be some way of looking at those three things which would make\nsense And I empty my mind blank and forget the circumstances of the crime and take\nthese things on their own merits.",
    "I say\u2014a struggle.",
    "What does that suggest Violence\u2014\nbreakage\u2014noise...",
    "The key Why does one turn a key So that no one shall enter But the\nkey did not prevent that since the door was broken down almost immediately.",
    "To keep\nsomeone in To keep someone out A snip of rubber I say to myself \u201cA little piece of a\nspongebag is a little piece of a spongebag and that is all\u201d\u2019\n\u2018So you would say there is nothing there\u2014and yet that is not strictly true for three\nimpressions remain noise\u2014seclusion\u2014blankness...\u2019\n\u2018Do they fit with either of my two possibles No they do not.",
    "To both Alfred Lee and Hilda\nLee a quiet murder would have been infinitely preferable to have wasted time in locking\nthe door from the outside is absurd and the little piece of spongebag means yet once\nmore\u2014nothing at all\u2019\n\u2018And yet I have very strongly the feeling that there is nothing absurd about this crime\u2014\nthat it is on the contrary very well planned and admirably executed.",
    "That is has in fact\nsucceeded Therefore that everything that has happened was meant...\u2019\n\u2018And then going over it again I got my first glimmer of light...\u2019\n\u2018Blood\u2014so much blood\u2014blood everywhere... An insistence on blood\u2014fresh wet\ngleaming blood...",
    "So much blood\u2014too much blood...\n\n172\n\n\f\u2018And a second thought comes with that.",
    "This is a crime of blood\u2014it is in the blood.",
    "It is\nSimeon Lee\u2019s own blood that rises up against him...\u2019\nHercule Poirot leaned forward.",
    "\u2018The two most valuable clues in this case were uttered quite unconsciously by two\ndifferent people.",
    "The first was when Mrs Alfred Lee quoted a line from Macbeth \u201cWho\nwould have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him\u201d The other was a\nphrase uttered by Tressilian the butler.",
    "He described how he felt dazed and things\nseemed to be happening that had happened before.",
    "It was a very simple occurrence that\ngave him that strange feeling.",
    "He heard a ring at the bell and went to open the door to\nHarry Lee and the next day he did the same thing to Stephen Farr.\u2019\n\u2018Now why did he have that feeling Look at Harry Lee and Stephen Farr and you will see\nwhy.",
    "They are astoundingly alike That was why opening the door to Stephen Farr was just\nlike opening the door to Harry Lee.",
    "It might almost have been the same man standing\nthere.",
    "And then only today Tressilian mentioned that he was always getting muddled\nbetween people.",
    "No wonder Stephen Farr has a high\u2010bridged nose a habit of throwing\nhis head back when he laughs and a trick of stroking his jaw with his forefinger.",
    "Look long\nand earnestly at the portrait of Simeon Lee as a young man and you see not only Harry\nLee but Stephen Farr...\u2019\nStephen moved.",
    "His chair creaked.",
    "Poirot said \u2018Remember that outburst of Simeon Lee\nhis tirade against his family.",
    "He said you remember it that he would swear he had better\nsons born the wrong side of the blanket.",
    "We are back again at the character of Simeon\nLee.",
    "Simeon Lee who was successful with women and who broke his wife\u2019s heart Simeon\nLee who boasted to Pilar that he might have a bodyguard of sons almost the same age So\nI came to this conclusion Simeon Lee had not only his legitimate family in the house but\nan unacknowledged and unrecognized son of his own blood.\u2019\nStephen got to his feet.",
    "Poirot said \u2018That was your real reason wasn\u2019t it Not that pretty\nromance of the girl you met in the train You were coming here before you met her.",
    "Coming to see what kind of a man your father was...\u2019\nStephen had gone dead white.",
    "He said and his voice was broken and husky \u2018Yes I\u2019ve\nalways wondered...",
    "Mother spoke about him sometimes.",
    "It grew into a kind of obsession\nwith me\u2014to see what he was like I made a bit of money and I came to England.",
    "I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to let him know who I was.",
    "I pretended to be old Eb\u2019s son.",
    "I came here for one\nreason only\u2014to see the man who was my father...\u2019\nSuperintendent Sugden said in almost a whisper \u2018Lord I\u2019ve been blind...",
    "I can see it now.",
    "Twice I\u2019ve taken you for Mr Harry Lee and then seen my mistake and yet I never guessed\u2019\nHe turned on Pilar.",
    "\u2018That was it wasn\u2019t it It was Stephen Farr you saw standing outside that door You\nhesitated I remember and looked at him before you said it was a woman.",
    "It was Farr you\nsaw and you weren\u2019t going to give him away.\u2019\n173\n\n\fThere was a gentle rustle.",
    "Hilda Lee\u2019s deep voice spoke \u2018No\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re wrong.",
    "It\nwas I whom Pilar saw...\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You madame Yes I thought so...\u2019\nHilda said quietly \u2018Self\u2010preservation is a curious thing.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t believe I could be such a\ncoward.",
    "To keep silence just because I was afraid\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You will tell us now\u2019\nShe nodded.",
    "\u2018I was with David in the music\u2010room.",
    "He was playing.",
    "He was in a very queer mood.",
    "I was a\nlittle frightened and I felt my responsibility very keenly because it was I who had insisted\non coming here.",
    "David began to play the \u201cDead March\u201d and suddenly I made up my mind.",
    "However odd it might seem I determined that we would both leave at once\u2014that night.",
    "I\nwent quietly out of the music\u2010room and upstairs.",
    "I meant to go to old Mr Lee and tell him\nquite plainly why we were going.",
    "I went along the corridor to his room and knocked on the\ndoor.",
    "There was no answer.",
    "I knocked again a little louder.",
    "There was still no answer.",
    "Then\nI tried the door handle.",
    "The door was locked.",
    "And then as I stood hesitating I heard a\nsound inside the room\u2014\u2019\nShe stopped.",
    "\u2018You won\u2019t believe me but it\u2019s true Someone was in there\u2014assaulting Mr Lee.",
    "I heard\ntables and chairs overturned and the crash of glass and china and then I heard that one\nlast horrible cry that died away to nothing\u2014and then silence.",
    "\u2018I stood there paralysed I couldn\u2019t move And then Mr Farr came running along and\nMagdalene and all the others and Mr Farr and Harry began to batter on the door.",
    "It went\ndown and we saw the room and there was no one in it\u2014except Mr Lee lying dead in all\nthat blood.\u2019\nHer quiet voice rose higher.",
    "She cried \u2018There was no one else there\u2014no one you\nunderstand And no one had come out of the room...\u2019\nVII\nSuperintendent Sugden drew a deep breath.",
    "He said \u2018Either I\u2019m going mad or everybody\nelse is What you\u2019ve said Mrs Lee is just plumb impossible.",
    "It\u2019s crazy\u2019\nHilda Lee cried \u2018I tell you I heard them fighting in there and I heard the old man scream\nwhen his throat was cut\u2014and no one came out and no one was in the room\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018And all this time you have said nothing.\u2019\nHilda Lee\u2019s face was white but she said steadily \u2018No because if I told you what had\nhappened there\u2019s only one thing you could say or think\u2014that it was I who killed him...\u2019\n174\n\n\fPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018You did not kill him.",
    "His son killed him.\u2019\nStephen Farr said \u2018I swear before God I never touched him\u2019\n\u2018Not you\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018He had other sons\u2019\nHarry said \u2018What the hell\u2014\u2019\nGeorge stared.",
    "David drew his hand across his eyes.",
    "Alfred blinked twice.",
    "Poirot said \u2018The very first night I was here\u2014the night of the murder\u2014I saw a ghost.",
    "It was\nthe ghost of the dead man.",
    "When I first saw Harry Lee I was puzzled.",
    "I felt I had seen him\nbefore.",
    "Then I noted his features carefully and I realized how like his father he was and I\ntold myself that that was what caused the feeling of familiarity.\u2019\n\u2018But yesterday a man sitting opposite me threw back his head and laughed\u2014and I knew\nwho it was Harry Lee reminded me of.",
    "And I traced again in another face the features of\nthe dead man.\u2019\n\u2018No wonder poor old Tressilian felt confused when he had answered the door not to two\nbut to three men who resembled each other closely.",
    "No wonder he confessed to getting\nmuddled about people when there were three men in the house who at a little distance\ncould pass for each other The same build the same gestures one in particular a trick of\nstroking the jaw the same habit of laughing with the head thrown back the same\ndistinctive high\u2010bridged nose.",
    "Yet the similarity was not always easy to see\u2014for the third\nman had a moustache.\u2019\nHe leaned forward.",
    "\u2018One forgets sometimes that police officers are men that they have wives and children\nmothers\u2019\u2014he paused\u2014\u2018and fathers...",
    "Remember Simeon Lee\u2019s local reputation a man\nwho broke his wife\u2019s heart because of his affairs with women.",
    "A son born the wrong side\nof the blanket may inherit many things.",
    "He may inherit his father\u2019s features and even his\ngestures.",
    "He may inherit his pride and his patience and his revengeful spirit\u2019\nHis voice rose.",
    "\u2018All your life Sugden you\u2019ve resented the wrong your father did you.",
    "I think you\ndetermined long ago to kill him.",
    "You come from the next county not very far away.",
    "Doubtless your mother with the money Simeon Lee so generously gave her was able to\nfind a husband who would stand father to her child.",
    "Easy for you to enter the Middleshire\nPolice Force and wait your opportunity.",
    "A police superintendent has a grand opportunity\nof committing a murder and getting away with it.\u2019\nSugden\u2019s face had gone white as paper.",
    "175\n\n\fHe said \u2018You\u2019re mad I was outside the house when he was killed.\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u2018No you killed him before you left the house the first time.",
    "No one saw him alive after you\nleft.",
    "It was all so easy for you.",
    "Simeon Lee expected you yes but he never sent for you.",
    "It\nwas you who rang him up and spoke vaguely about an attempt at robbery.",
    "You said you\nwould call upon him just before eight that night and would pretend to be collecting for a\npolice charity.",
    "Simeon Lee had no suspicions.",
    "He did not know you were his son.",
    "You came\nand told him a tale of substituted diamonds.",
    "He opened the safe to show you that the real\ndiamonds were safe in his possession.",
    "You apologized came back to the hearth with him\nand catching him unawares you cut his throat holding your hand over his mouth so that\nhe shouldn\u2019t cry out.",
    "Child\u2019s play to a man of your powerful physique.\u2019\n\u2018Then you set the scene.",
    "You took the diamonds.",
    "You piled up tables and chairs lamps and\nglasses and twined a very thin rope or cord which you had brought in coiled round your\nbody in and out between them.",
    "You had with you a bottle of some freshly killed animal\u2019s\nblood to which you had added a quantity of sodium citrate.",
    "You sprinkled this about freely\nand added more sodium citrate to the pool of blood which flowed from Simeon Lee\u2019s\nwound.",
    "You made up up the fire so that the body should keep its warmth.",
    "Then you\npassed the two ends of the cord out through the narrow slit at the bottom of the window\nand let them hang down the wall.",
    "You left the room and turned the key from the outside.",
    "That was vital since no one must by any chance enter that room.\u2019\n\u2018Then you went out and hid the diamonds in the stone sink garden.",
    "If sooner or later they\nwere discovered there they would only focus suspicion more strongly where you wanted\nit on the members of Simeon Lee\u2019s legitimate family.",
    "A little before nine\u2010fifteen you\nreturned and going up to the wall underneath the window you pulled on the cord.",
    "That\ndislodged the carefully piled\u2010up structure you had arranged.",
    "Furniture and china fell with a\ncrash.",
    "You pulled on one end of the cord and re\u2010wound it round your body under your\ncoat and waistcoat.\u2019\n\u2018You had one further device\u2019\nHe turned to the others.",
    "\u2018Do you remember all of you how each of you described the dying scream of Mr Lee in a\ndifferent way You Mr Lee described it as the cry of a man in mortal agony.",
    "Your wife and\nDavid Lee both used the expression a soul in hell.",
    "Mrs David Lee on the contrary said it\nwas the cry of someone who had no soul.",
    "She said it was inhuman like a beast.",
    "It was\nHarry Lee who came nearest to the truth.",
    "He said it sounded like killing a pig.\u2019\n\u2018Do you know those long pink bladders that are sold at fairs with faces painted on them\ncalled \u201cDying Pigs\u201d As the air rushes out they give forth an inhuman wail.",
    "That Sugden\nwas your final touch.",
    "You arranged one of those in the room.",
    "The mouth of it was stopped\nup with a peg but that peg was connected to the cord.",
    "When you pulled on the cord the\npeg came out and the pig began to deflate.",
    "On top of the falling furniture came the\nscream of the \u201cDying Pig\u201d.\u2019\n176\n\n\fHe turned once more to the others.",
    "\u2018You see now what it was that Pilar Estravados picked up The superintendent had hoped\nto get there in time to retrieve that little wisp of rubber before anyone noticed it.",
    "However he took it from Pilar quickly enough in his most official manner.",
    "But remember\nhe never mentioned that incident to anyone.",
    "In itself that was a singularly suspicious fact.",
    "I heard of it from Magdalene Lee and tackled him about it.",
    "He was prepared for that\neventuality.",
    "He had snipped a piece from Mr Lee\u2019s rubber spongebag and produced that\ntogether with a wooden peg.",
    "Superficially it answered to the same description\u2014a\nfragment of rubber and a piece of wood.",
    "It meant as I realized at the time absolutely\nnothing But fool that I was I did not at once say \u201cThis means nothing so it cannot have\nbeen there and Superintendent Sugden is lying...\u201d No I foolishly went on trying to find an\nexplanation for it.",
    "It was not until Mademoiselle Estravados was playing with a balloon\nthat burst and she cried out that it must have been a burst balloon she picked up in\nSimeon Lee\u2019s room that I saw the truth.\u2019\n\u2018You see now how everything fits in The improbable struggle which is necessary to\nestablish a false time of death the locked door\u2014so that nobody shall find the body too\nsoon the dying man\u2019s scream.",
    "The crime is now logical and reasonable.\u2019\n\u2018But from the moment that Pilar Estravados cried aloud her discovery about the balloon\nshe was a source of danger to the murderer.",
    "And if that remark had been heard by him\nfrom the house which it well might for her voice was high and clear and the windows\nwere open she herself was in considerable danger.",
    "Already she had given the murderer\none very nasty moment.",
    "She had said speaking of old Mr Lee \u201cHe must have been very\ngood\u2010looking when he was young.\u201d And had added speaking directly to Sugden \u201cLike\nyou.\u201d She meant that literally and Sugden knew it.",
    "No wonder Sugden went purple in the\nface and nearly choked.",
    "It was so unexpected and so deadly dangerous.",
    "He hoped after\nthat to fix the guilt on her but it proved unexpectedly difficult since as the old man\u2019s\nportionless granddaughter she had obviously no motive for the crime.",
    "Later when he\noverheard from the house her clear high voice calling out its remark about the balloon he\ndecided on desperate measures.",
    "He set that booby trap when we were at lunch.",
    "Luckily\nalmost by a miracle it failed...\u2019\nThere was dead silence.",
    "Then Sugden said quietly \u2018When were you sure\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I was not quite sure till I brought home a false moustache and tried it on\nSimeon Lee\u2019s picture.",
    "Then\u2014the face that looked at me was yours.\u2019\nSugden said \u2018God rot his soul in hell I\u2019m glad I did it\u2019\n\n177\n\n\f178\n\n\fPart 7\nDecember 28th\nLydia Lee said\n\u2018Pilar I think you had better stay with us until we can arrange something definite for you.\u2019\nPilar said meekly \u2018You are very good Lydia.",
    "You are nice.",
    "You forgive people quite easily\nwithout making a fuss about it.\u2019\nLydia said smiling \u2018I still call you Pilar though I suppose your name is something else.\u2019\n\u2018Yes I am really Conchita Lopez.\u2019\n\u2018Conchita is a pretty name too.\u2019\n\u2018You are really almost too nice Lydia.",
    "But you don\u2019t need to be bothered by me.",
    "I am\ngoing to marry Stephen and we are going to South Africa.\u2019\nLydia said smiling \u2018Well that rounds off things very nicely.\u2019\nPilar said timidly \u2018Since you have been so kind do you think Lydia that one day we might\ncome back and stay with you\u2014perhaps for Christmas\u2014and then we could have the\ncrackers and the burning raisins and those shiny things on a tree and the little snowmen\u2019\n\u2018Certainly you shall come and have a real English Christmas.\u2019\n\u2018That will be lovely.",
    "You see Lydia I feel that this year it was not a nice Christmas at all.\u2019\nLydia caught her breath.",
    "She said \u2018No it was not a nice Christmas...\u2019\nII\nHarry said \u2018Well goodbye Alfred.",
    "Don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll be troubled by seeing much of me.",
    "I\u2019m off to Hawaii.",
    "Always meant to live there if I had a bit of money.\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018Goodbye Harry.",
    "I expect you\u2019ll enjoy yourself.",
    "I hope so.\u2019\nHarry said rather awkwardly \u2018Sorry I riled you so much old man.",
    "Rotten sense of humour\nI\u2019ve got.",
    "Can\u2019t help trying to pull a fellow\u2019s leg.\u2019\nAlfred said with an effort \u2018Suppose I must learn to take a joke.\u2019\nHarry said with relief \u2018Well\u2014so\u2010long.\u2019\n179\n\n\fIII\nAlfred said \u2018David Lydia and I have decided to sell up this place.",
    "I thought perhaps you\u2019d\nlike some of the things that were our mother\u2019s\u2014her chair and that footstool.",
    "You were\nalways her favourite.\u2019\nDavid hesitated a minute.",
    "Then he said slowly \u2018Thanks for the thought Alfred but do you\nknow I don\u2019t think I will.",
    "I don\u2019t want anything out of the house.",

    "What a terrible time we have been\nthrough.",
    "There\u2019s the trial coming on too.",
    "I suppose the whole disgraceful story is bound to\ncome out\u2014Sugden being\u2014er\u2014my father\u2019s son.",
    "One couldn\u2019t arrange for it to be put to\nhim I suppose that it would be better if he pleaded advanced Communist views and\ndislike of my father as a capitalist\u2014something of that kind\u2019\nLydia said \u2018My dear George do you really imagine that a man like Sugden would tell lies\nto soothe our feelings\u2019\nGeorge said \u2018Er\u2014perhaps not.",
    "No I see your point.",
    "All the same the man must be mad.",
    "Well goodbye again.\u2019\nMagdalene said \u2018Good bye.",
    "Next year do let\u2019s all go to the Riviera or somewhere for\nChristmas and be really gay.\u2019\nGeorge said \u2018Depends on the Exchange.\u2019\nMagdalene said \u2018Darling don\u2019t be mean.\u2019\nV\nAlfred came out on the terrace.",

    "There are so many interesting things we can do together.",
    "To live on\nhere would be to be constantly reminded of that nightmare.",
    "Thank God it\u2019s all over\u2019\nLydia said \u2018Thanks to Hercule Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "You know it was really amazing the way everything fell into place when he explained\nit.\u2019\n\u2018I know.",
    "Like when you finish a jig\u2010saw puzzle and all the queer\u2010shaped bits you swear\nwon\u2019t fit in anywhere find their places quite naturally.\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018There\u2019s one little thing that never fitted in.",
    "What was George doing after he\ntelephoned Why wouldn\u2019t he say\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know I knew all the time.",
    "He was having a look through your papers on your\ndesk.\u2019\n\u2018Oh No Lydia no one would do a thing like that\u2019\n\u2018George would.",
    "He\u2019s frightfully curious about money matters.",
    "But of course he couldn\u2019t\nsay so.",
    "He\u2019d have had to be actually in the dock before he\u2019d have owned up to that.\u2019\nAlfred said \u2018Are you making another garden\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018What is it this time\u2019\n\u2018I think\u2019 said Lydia \u2018it\u2019s an attempt at the Garden of Eden.",
    "A new version\u2014without any\nserpent\u2014and Adam and Eve are definitely middle\u2010aged.\u2019\nAlfred said gently \u2018Dear Lydia how patient you have been all these years.",
    "You have been\nvery good to me.\u2019\nLydia said \u2018But you see Alfred I love you...\u2019\nVI\nColonel Johnson said \u2018God bless my soul\u2019 Then he said \u2018Upon my word\u2019 And finally once\nmore \u2018God bless my soul\nHe leaned back in his chair and stared at Poirot.",
    "He said plaintively \u2018My best man What\u2019s\nthe police coming to\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Even policemen have private lives Sugden was a very proud man.\u2019\nColonel Johnson shook his head.",
