    "\f\fThe Floating Admiral\n\n\f\n\n\fFOREWORD\nBy Simon Brett\nPRESIDENT OF THE DETECTION CLUB 2001\u2013\nis appropriate that the origins of the Detection Club are shrouded in mystery.",
    "No official archives for the organisation have ever been kept and so its history\nhas to be pieced together from the memoirs correspondence hints and\nrecollections of its members.",
    "One reason for this incomplete record may be that\nthe Club originally prided itself on being a kind of secret society with rituals\nknown only to its initiates.",
    "In the days of the internet however such a level of\nsecurity is impossible.",
    "Indeed an extract from the Detection Club\u2019s most secret\nrite the Initiation of New Members is readily accessible on Wikipedia.",
    "So the Club\u2019s history is at the best conjectural.",
    "One authority declares that it\nwas founded in 1932 with 26 members but this assertion is somewhat weakened\nby the fact that a letter was published in the Times Literary Supplement in 1930\nand signed by \u201cmembers of the Detection Club\u201d.",
    "And the serials The Scoop and\nBehind the Screen appeared in The Listener respectively in 1930 and 1931.",
    "They\nwere written by multiple authors including Agatha Christie Dorothy L. Sayers\nE. C. Bentley and Anthony Berkeley under the name of the Detection Club as\nwas this work The Floating Admiral whose copyright notice on the first edition\nreads \u201cThe Detection Club 1931\u201d.",
    "So a more likely prehistory of the Club was that round about 1928 Anthony\nBerkeley Cox who only used his first two names on his books and other\ndetective writers started to meet for informal dinners which then became more\nestablished into the rituals of a Club.",
    "According to some sources G. K.\nChesterton was appointed the first President\u2014though sometimes referred to as\n\u201cLeader\u201d\u2014in 1930.",
    "Mind you other authorities say that he didn\u2019t take over the\nPresidential mantle until 1932.",
    "Even the Detection Club itself is inconsistent\nabout the date.",
    "On its headed notepaper is stated that Chesterton\u2019s reign began in\n1932 whereas in the List of Members it says 1930.",
    "So you can really take your\npick.",
    "What is certain however is that on 11 March 1932 the \u201cConstitution and\nRules of the Detection Club\u201d were adopted.",
    "The opening section of this\ndocument reads \u201cThe Detection Club is instituted for the association of writers\nof detectivenovels and for promoting and continuing a mutual interest and\nIT\n\n\ffellowship between them.\u201d Members had to fulfil \u201cthe following condition That\nhe or she has written at least two detectivenovels of admitted merit or in\nexceptional cases one such novel it being understood that the term \u2018detectivenovel\u2019 does not include adventurestories or \u2018thrillers\u2019 or stories in which the\ndetection is not the main interest and that it is a demerit in a detectivenovel if\nthe author does not \u2018play fair by the reader\u2019.\u201d\nIn this 1932 Constitution the Ordinary Meetings of the Club should be \u201cnot\nfewer than four in the year\u201d so things haven\u2019t changed that much.",
    "In 2010\u2014and\nfor many years before that\u2014the Detection Club met three times.",
    "What has changed is the criterion of admissibility for potential candidates.",
    "With the great spread of crime fiction\u2019s range the qualification has been\nextended way beyond the traditional whodunit which is just as well because\nvery few people nowadays write traditional whodunits.",
    "The current membership\ncertainly includes writers of \u201cadventurestories or \u2018thrillers\u2019 or stories in which\nthe detection is not the main interest\u201d as well as practitioners of the historical\nlegal forensic psychopathological and other developing subgenres.",
    "Crime\nfiction is a much broader church now than it was in the 1920s and 1930s and the\nDetection Club reflects that.",
    "Some would argue that contemporary mysteries are much more varied and\nfrequently better written than the offerings of that socalled \u201cGolden Age\u201d.",
    "They\nare certainly more psychologically credible than many of the works produced at\nthat time.",
    "They are also more serious sometimes even to the point of taking\nthemselves too seriously.",
    "In crime fiction noir is the new black.",
    "Most of these differences could be seen as improvements but the one thing\nthat has been lost with the passage of time is the sense of fun that used to be\nassociated with crime fiction.",
    "In her introduction to The Floating Admiral\nDorothy L. Sayers\u2019 description of the collaborative exercise is \u201cthe detection\ngame as played out on paper by certain members of the Detection Club among\nthemselves.\u201d And later she writes \u201cWhether the game thus played for our own\namusement will succeed in amusing other people also is for the reader to judge.\u201d\nThe fact that the book is being reissued yet again suggests that there are still\nplenty of readers out there willing to be amused by the game.",
    "A lot of Golden Age crime novels were games.",
    "A murder mystery was an\nintellectual challenge rather on the same level as a crossword\u2014and it\u2019s\ninteresting that the two forms of entertainment both developed around the same\ntime.",
    "In the days before television in the days of country house parties such\ngames were very popular.",
    "Collections of crime puzzles\u2014like F. Tennyson\nJesse\u2019s The Baffle Book A Parlour Game of Mystery and Detection\u2014sold in\nlarge numbers.",
    "It was indeed the age of the parlour game \u2026 which hardly exists\n\n\fnowadays.",
    "People don\u2019t have parlour games.",
    "Very few of them even have\nparlours.",
    "But it is in the spirit of a parlour game that The Floating Admiral should be\napproached.",
    "The idea of a serious should I use that awful word \u201cliterary\u201d\nnovel written by a relay of authors is incongruous.",
    "For a lighthearted work of\ncrime fiction though the concept is fun and I think it\u2019s clear that the writers\ninvolved in The Floating Admiral enjoyed the intellectual challenge that faced\nthem.",
    "I have been involved in a couple of collaborative ventures of this kind and I\nvery quickly discovered that the best job to get is that of the person who starts\nthe story.",
    "In the first chapter you can sprinkle clues and inconsistencies with\nreckless abandon secure in the knowledge that it won\u2019t be you who has to tie up\nall the loose ends later.",
    "As a logical consequence of this the worst job is writing\nthe final chapter pulling together all the threads of the story to produce a\ncredible solution to the mystery.",
    "The temptation to begin that final chapter with\nthe words \u201cBut it was all a dream \u2026\u201d is strong.",
    "In The Floating Admiral this particular short straw was drawn by Anthony\nBerkeley which was probably just as well.",
    "The author of The Poisoned\nChocolate Case who also under the pseudonym of Francis Iles produced the\nclassic thriller Malice Aforethought was equipped both as whodunit plotter and\nas someone who understood the psychology of the criminal mind.",
    "If he couldn\u2019t\nmake sense of the ending nobody could and I think it\u2019s significant that his final\nchapter is entitled Clearing Up the Mess.",
    "Berkeley is one of the contributors to The Floating Admiral whose name is\nstill reasonably well known at least to crime fiction buffs.",
    "The same could be\nsaid of Monsignor Ronald A. Knox Freeman Wills Croft and Clemence Dane.",
    "Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers of course are big hitters seemingly\ndestined to endure forever and G. K. Chesterton is still a wellknown literary\nfigure though the Prologue he wrote to this volume seems to bear no relation to\nanything in the ensuing novel.",
    "Some of the other contributors\u2019 names have dropped off the radar almost\ncompletely\u2014except in the consciousness of dedicated collectors\u2014but I was\ninterested to know a little about them to help me visualise the composition of\nthe Detection Club in its early years.",
    "So here are my findings\nCanon Victor L. Whitechurch was as his title suggests a clergyman whose\nfictional creation Thorpe Hazell was a vegetarian railway detective intended to\nbe as different as possible from Sherlock Holmes.",
    "Whitechurch was one of the\nfirst crime writers to submit his manuscripts to Scotland Yard to check he\u2019d got\nhis police procedural details right an effort that many contemporary\n\n\fpractitioners of the genre still don\u2019t bother to make.",
    "G. D. H. George Howard Douglas and M. Margaret Cole were a husband\nand wife team of crime writers.",
    "Both leftwing intellectuals in 1931 G. D. H.\nformed the Society for Socialist Inquiry and Propaganda later to be renamed the\nSocialist League.",
    "Amongst the undergraduates he taught at Oxford was the\nfuture Prime Minister Harold Wilson.",
    "Henry Wade was the pseudonym of Henry Lancelot AubreyFletcher 6th\nBaronet who was awarded both the D.S.O.",
    "and the Croix de Guerre for his\nbravery in the First World War.",
    "As well as writing twenty crime novels he was\nHigh Sheriff of Buckinghamshire.",
    "John Rhode was one of the pseudonyms of Cecil John Charles Street.",
    "Also\nwriting as Miles Burton and Cecil Waye in his lifetime he published over 140\nbooks.",
    "Milward Kennedy was the pseudonym of Milward Rodon Kennedy Burge an\nOxfordeducated career civil servant who specialised in police procedurals.",
    "He\nalso wrote books under the androgynous name Evelyn Elder.",
    "Edgar Jepson had an enormously varied literary career.",
    "As well as crime\nnovels and popular romances he wrote children\u2019s stories and is probably best\nremembered now for his fantasy fiction.",
    "His son and daughter were both\npublished authors and his granddaughter is the writer Fay Weldon.",
    "So just a few snapshots of the 1931 Detection Club members who\ncollaborated on The Floating Admiral.",
    "I find it intriguing to imagine the dinners\nthey must have shared when they cooked up the ideas for this relay novel.",
    "Also\nthe conversations \u2026 I\u2019m sure like contemporary members of the Detection\nClub though they talked a bit about the craft of crime writing it was when they\ngot on to other topics that they became more energised.",
    "I can visualise religious\ndiscussions between the Catholic convert Ronald Knox the Anglican canon\nVictor Whiteside and the Christian humanist Dorothy L. Sayers.",
    "I wonder how\nthe idealistic Socialism of G. D. H. and M. Cole went down with the aristocratic\nHenry Wade.",
    "And writing all those books John Rhode must have had difficulty\nfinding time to attend the dinners.",
    "But enough nostalgia.",
    "One thing I am sure of though \u2026 The dinners of the\nembryonic organisation during which the plot of The Floating Admiral was\nhatched would have been conducted in just the same spirit of good humour and\ncongeniality which I am glad to say still characterises today\u2019s Detection Club.",
    "What can be wrong after all with an exclusive organisation of some sixty\nmembers which exists in the words of Dorothy L. Sayers \u201cchiefly for the\npurpose of eating dinners together at suitable intervals and of talking illimitable\nshop\u201d\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\nBy Dorothy L. Sayers\nTHE FLOATING ADMIRAL\nmembers of the official police force are invited to express an opinion\nabout the great detectives of fiction they usually say with a kindly smile \u201cWell\nof course it\u2019s not the same for them as it is for us.",
    "The author knows beforehand\nwho did the job and the great detective has only to pick up the clues that are laid\ndown for him.",
    "It\u2019s wonderful\u201d they indulgently add \u201cthe clever ideas these\nauthors hit upon but we don\u2019t think they would work very well in real life.\u201d\nThere is probably much truth in these observations and they are in any case\ndifficult to confute.",
    "If Mr. John Rhode for example could be induced to commit\na real murder by one of the ingeniously simple methods he so easily invents in\nfiction and if Mr. Freeman Wills Crofts say would undertake to pursue him\nBradshaw in hand from Stranraer to Saint JuanlesPins then indeed we might\nput the matter to the test.",
    "But writers of detective fiction are as a rule not\nbloodthirsty people.",
    "They avoid physical violence for two reasons first because\ntheir murderous feelings are so efficiently blownoff in print as to have little\nenergy left for boiling up in action and secondly because they are so\naccustomed to the idea that murders are made to be detected that they feel a\nwholesome reluctance to put their criminal theories into practice.",
    "While as for\ndoing real detecting the fact is that few of them have the time for it being\nengaged in earning their bread and butter like reasonable citizens unblessed with\nthe ample leisure of a Wimsey or a Father Brown.",
    "But the next best thing to a genuine contest is a good game and The Floating\nAdmiral is the detection game as played out on paper by certain members of the\nDetection Club among themselves.",
    "And here it may be asked What is the\nDetection Club\nIt is a private association of writers of detective fiction in Great Britain\nexisting chiefly for the purpose of eating dinners together at suitable intervals\nand of talking illimitable shop.",
    "It owes no allegiance to any publisher nor\nthough willing to turn an honest penny by offering the present venture to the\npublic is it primarily concerned with making money.",
    "It is not a committee of\njudges for recommending its own or other people\u2019s books and indeed has no\nobject but to amuse itself.",
    "Its membership is confined to those who have written\nWHEN\n\n\fgenuine detective stories not adventure tales or \u201cthrillers\u201d and election is\nsecured by a vote of the club on recommendation by two or more members and\ninvolves the undertaking of an oath.",
    "While wild horses would not drag from me any revelation of the solemn ritual\nof the Detection Club a word as to the nature of the oath is perhaps\npermissible.",
    "Put briefly it amounts to this that the author pledges himself to\nplay the game with the public and with his fellowauthors.",
    "His detectives must\ndetect by their wits without the help of accident or coincidence he must not\ninvent impossible deathrays and poisons to produce solutions which no living\nperson could expect he must write as good English as he can.",
    "He must preserve\ninviolable secrecy concerning his fellowmembers\u2019 forthcoming plots and titles\nand he must give any assistance in his power to members who need advice on\ntechnical points.",
    "If there is any serious aim behind the avowedly frivolous\norganisation of the Detection Club it is to keep the detective story up to the\nhighest standard that its nature permits and to free it from the bad legacy of\nsensationalism claptrap and jargon with which it was unhappily burdened in the\npast.",
    "Now a word about the conditions under which The Floating Admiral was\nwritten.",
    "Here the problem was made to approach as closely as possible to a\nproblem of real detection.",
    "Except in the case of Mr. Chesterton\u2019s picturesque\nPrologue which was written last each contributor tackled the mystery presented\nto him in the preceding chapters without having the slightest idea what solution\nor solutions the previous authors had in mind.",
    "Two rules only were imposed.",
    "Each writer must construct his instalment with a definite solution in view\u2014that\nis he must not introduce new complications merely \u201cto make it more difficult.\u201d\nHe must be ready if called upon to explain his own clues coherently and\nplausibly and to make sure that he was playing fair in this respect each writer\nwas bound to deliver together with the manuscript of his own chapter his own\nproposed solution of the mystery.",
    "These solutions are printed at the end of the\nbook for the benefit of the curious reader.",
    "Secondly each writer was bound to deal faithfully with all the difficulties left\nfor his consideration by his predecessors.",
    "If Elma\u2019s attitude towards love and\nmarriage appeared to fluctuate strangely or if the boat was put into the boathouse wrong end first those facts must form part of his solution.",
    "He must not\ndismiss them as caprice or accident or present an explanation inconsistent with\nthem.",
    "Naturally as the clues became in process of time more numerous the\nsuggested solutions grew more complicated and precise while the general\noutlines of the plot gradually hardened and fixed themselves.",
    "But it is\nentertaining and instructive to note the surprising number of different\n\n\finterpretations which may be devised to account for the simplest actions.",
    "Where\none writer may have laid down a clue thinking that it could point only in one\nobvious direction succeeding writers have managed to make it point in a\ndirection exactly opposite.",
    "And it is here perhaps that the game approximates\nmost closely to real life.",
    "We judge one another by our outward actions but in the\nmotive underlying those actions our judgment may be widely at fault.",
    "Preoccupied by our own private interpretation of the matter we can see only the\none possible motive behind the action so that our solution may be quite\nplausible quite coherent and quite wrong.",
    "And here possibly we detectivewriters may have succeeded in wholesomely surprising and confounding\nourselves and one another.",
    "We are only too much accustomed to let the great\ndetective say airily \u201cCannot you see my dear Watson that these facts admit of\nonly one interpretation\u201d After our experience in the matter of The Floating\nAdmiral our great detectives may have to learn to express themselves more\nguardedly.",
    "Whether the game thus played for our own amusement will succeed in\namusing other people also is for the reader to judge.",
    "We can only assure him that\nthe game was played honestly according to the rules and with all the energy and\nenthusiasm which the players knew how to put into it.",
    "Speaking for myself I\nmay say that the helpless bewilderment into which I was plunged on receipt of\nMr. Milward Kennedy\u2019s little bunch of brainteasers was apparently fully\nequalled by the hideous sensation of bafflement which overcame Father Ronald\nKnox when having as I fondly imagined cleared up much that was obscure I\nhanded the problem on to him.",
    "That Mr. Anthony Berkeley should so cheerfully\nhave confounded our politics and frustrated our knavish tricks in the final\nsolution I must attribute partly to his native ingenuity and partly to the energetic\ninterference of the other three intervening solvers who discovered so many facts\nand motives that we earlier gropers in the dark knew nothing about.",
    "But none of\nus I think will bear any malice against our fellowauthors any more than\nagainst the vagaries of the River Whyn which powerfully guided by Mr. Henry\nWade and Mr. John Rhode twin luminaries of its tidal waters bore so peacefully\nbetween its flowery banks the body of the Floating Admiral.",
    "PROLOGUE\nBy G. K. Chesterton\n\u201cTHE THREE PIPE DREAMS\u201d\nglimpses through the rolling smoke of opium three stories that still hover\nabout a squalid opium joint in Hong Kong might very well at this distance of\ntime be dismissed as pipe dreams.",
    "Yet they really happened they were stages in\nthe great misfortune of a man\u2019s life although many who played their parts in the\ndrama would have forgotten it by the morning.",
    "A large paperlantern coarsely\nscrawled with a glaring crimson dragon hung over the black and almost\nsubterranean entrance of the den the moon was up and the little street was\nalmost deserted.",
    "We all talk of the mystery of Asia and there is a sense in which we are all\nwrong.",
    "Asia has been hardened by the ages it is old so that its bones stick out\nand in one sense there is less disguise and mystification about it than there is\nabout the more living and moving problems of the West.",
    "The dopepeddlers and\nopium hags and harlots who made the dingy life of that place were fixed and\nrecognised in their functions in something almost like a social hierarchy\nsometimes their vice was official and almost religious as in the dancinggirls of\nthe temples.",
    "But the English naval officer who strode at that instant past that\ndoor and had occasion to pause there was in reality much more of a mystery\nfor he was a mystery even to himself.",
    "There were bound up in his character both\nnational and individual the most complex and contradictory things codes and\ncompromises about codes and a conscience strangely fitful and illogical\nsentimental instincts that recoiled from sentiment and religious feelings that had\noutlived religion a patriotism that prided itself on being merely practical and\nprofessional all the tangled traditions of a great Pagan and a great Christian\npast the mystery of the West.",
    "It grew more and more mysterious because he\nhimself never thought about it.",
    "Indeed there is only one part of it that anybody need think about for the\npurposes of this tale.",
    "Like every man of his type he had a perfectly sincere\nhatred of individual oppression which would not have saved him from taking\npart in impersonal or collective oppression if the responsibility were spread to\nall his civilisation or his country or his class.",
    "He was the Captain of a battleship\nlying at that moment in the harbour of Hong Kong.",
    "He would have shelled Hong\nTHREE\n\n\fKong to pieces and killed half the people in it even if it had been in that\nshameful war by which Great Britain forced opium upon China.",
    "But when he\nhappened to see one individual Chinese girl being dragged across the road by a\ngreasy yellow ruffian and flung headforemost into the opiumden something\nsprang up quite spontaneously within him an \u201cage\u201d that is never really past and\ncertain romances that were not really burned by the Barber something that does\nstill deserve the glorious insult of being called quixotic.",
    "With two or three\nbattering blows he sent the Chinaman spinning across the road where he\ncollapsed in a distant gutter.",
    "But the girl had already been flung down the steps\nof the dark entry and he precipitated himself after her with the purely instinctive\nimpetuosity of a charging bull.",
    "There was very little in his mind at that moment\nexcept rage and a very vague intention of delivering the captive from so\nuninviting a dungeon.",
    "But even over such a simple mood a wave of unconscious\nwarning seemed to pass the bloodred dragonlantern seemed to leer down at\nhim and he had some such blind sensation as might have overwhelmed St.\nGeorge if charging with a victorious lance he had found himself swallowed by\nthe dragon.",
    "And yet the next scene revealed in a rift of that visionary vapour is not any\nsuch scene of doom or punishment as some sensationalists might legitimately\nexpect.",
    "It will not be necessary to gratify the refined modern taste with scenes of\ntorture nor to avoid the vulgarity of a happy ending by killing the principal\ncharacter in the first chapter.",
    "Nevertheless the scene revealed was perhaps in its\nultimate effects almost more tragic than a scene of death.",
    "The most tragic thing\nabout it was that it was rather comic.",
    "The gleam of the tawdry lanterns in the\ndopeden revealed nothing but a huddle of drugged coolies with faces like\nyellow stone the sailors from a ship that had put into Hong Kong that morning\nflying the Stars and Stripes and the final feature of a tall English naval officer\nwearing the uniform of the Captain of a British ship behaving in a peculiar way\nand apparently under rather peculiar influences.",
    "It was believed by some that\nwhat he was performing was a hornpipe but that it was mingled with motions\ndesigned only to preserve equilibrium.",
    "The crew looking on was American that is to say some of them were\nSwedish several Polish several more Slavs of nameless nationality and a large\nnumber of brown Lascars from the ends of the earth.",
    "But they all saw something\nthat they very much wanted to see and had never seen before.",
    "They saw an\nEnglish gentleman unbend.",
    "He unbent with luxuriant slowness and then\nsuddenly bent double again and slid to the floor with a bang.",
    "He was understood\n\n\fto say\n\u201cDam\u2019 bad whisky but dam\u2019 good.",
    "WhadImeansay is\u201d he explained with\nlaborious logic \u201cwhisky dam\u2019 bad but dam\u2019 bad whisky dam\u2019 good thing.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s had more than whisky\u201d said one of the Swedish sailors in Swedish\nAmerican.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s had everything there is to have I should think\u201d replied a Pole with a\nrefined accent.",
    "And then a little swarthy Jew who was born in Budapest but had lived in\nWhitechapel struck up in piping tones a song he had heard there \u201cEvery nice\ngirl loves a sailor.\u201d And in his song there was a sneer that was some day to be\nseen on the face of Trotsky and to change the world.",
    "The dawn gives us the third glimpse of the harbour of Hong Kong where the\nbattleship flying the Stars and Stripes lay with the other battleship flying the\nUnion Jack and on the latter ship there was turmoil and blank dismay.",
    "The First\nand Second Officers looked at each other with growing alertness and alarm and\none of them looked at a watch.",
    "\u201cCan you suggest anything Mr. Lutterell\u201d said one of them with a sharp\nvoice but a very vague eye.",
    "\u201cI think we shall have to send somebody ashore to find out\u201d replied Mr.\nLutterell.",
    "At this point a third officer appeared hauling forward a heavy and reluctant\nseaman who was supposed to have some information to give but seemed to\nhave some difficulty in giving it.",
    "\u201cWell you see sir he\u2019s been found\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cThe Captain\u2019s been\nfound.\u201d\nSomething in his tone moved the First Officer to sudden horror.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean by found\u201d he cried.",
    "\u201cYou talk as if he was dead\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t think he\u2019s dead\u201d said the sailor with irritating slowness.",
    "\u201cBut\nhe looked deadlike.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid sir\u201d said the Second Officer in a low voice \u201cthat they\u2019re just\nbringing him in.",
    "I hope they\u2019ll be quick and keep it as quiet as they can.\u201d\nUnder these circumstances did the First Officer look up and behold his\nrespected Captain returning to his beloved ship.",
    "He was being carried like a sack\nby two dirtylooking coolies and the officers hastily closed round him and\ncarried him to his cabin.",
    "Then Mr. Lutterell turned sharply and sent for the ship\u2019s\ndoctor.",
    "\u201cHold these men for the moment\u201d he said pointing to the coolies \u201cwe\u2019ve got\n\n\fto know about this.",
    "Now then Doctor what\u2019s the matter with him\u201d\nThe doctor was a hardheaded hatchetfaced man having the not very popular\ncharacter of a candid friend and on this occasion he was very candid indeed.",
    "\u201cI can see and smell for myself\u201d he said \u201cbefore I begin the examination.",
    "He\u2019s had opium and whisky as well as Heaven knows what else.",
    "I should say\nhe\u2019s a bag of poisons.\u201d\n\u201cAny wounds at all\u201d asked the frowning Lutterell.",
    "\u201cI should say he\u2019s knocked himself out\u201d said the candid doctor.",
    "\u201cMost likely\nknocked himself out of the Service.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no right to say that\u201d said the First Officer severely.",
    "\u201cThat is for the\nauthorities.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said the other doggedly.",
    "\u201cAuthorities of a Court Martial I should say.",
    "No there are no wounds.\u201d\nThus do the first three stages of the story reach their conclusion and it must\nbe admitted with regret that so far there is no moral to the story.",
    "CHAPTER I\nBy Canon Victor L. Whitechurch\nCORPSE AHOY\nin Lingham knew old Neddy Ware though he was not a native of the\nvillage having only resided there for the last ten years which in the eyes of the\nolder inhabitants who had spent the whole of their lives in that quiet spot\nconstituted him still a \u201cstranger.\u201d\nNot that they really knew very much about him for the old man was of a\nretiring disposition and had few cronies.",
    "What they did know was that he was a\nretired petty officer of the Royal Navy subsisting on his pension that he was\nwholeheartedly devoted to the Waltonian craft spending most of his time fishing\nin the River Whyn and that though he was of a peaceful disposition generally\nhe had a vocabulary of awful and bloodcurdling swearwords if anyone upset\nhim by interfering with his sport.",
    "If you being a fellowfisherman took up your position on the bank of the\nRiver Whyn in a spot which Neddy Ware considered to be too near his he would\nlet drive at you with alarming emphasis if boys\u2014his pet aversion\u2014annoyed\nhim in any way by chattering around him his language became totally unfit for\njuvenile ears.",
    "Once young Harry Ayres the village champion where fisticuffs\nwere concerned had the temerity to throw a stone at the old man\u2019s float he\nslunk back home afterwards white in face and utterly cowed with the torrent of\nNeddy Ware\u2019s lurid remarks.",
    "He lived in a small cottage standing quite by itself on the outskirts of the\nvillage and he lived there alone.",
    "Mrs. Lambert a widow went to his cottage for\na couple of hours every morning to tidy up and cook his midday meal.",
    "For the\nrest Neddy Ware managed quite well.",
    "He came out of his cottage one August morning as the church clock some\nhalf a mile distant was striking four.",
    "Those who knew his habits would have\nseen nothing unusual in his rising so early.",
    "The fisherman knows the value of\nthose first morning hours besides which the little River Whyn which was the\nscene of his favourite occupation was tidal for some five or six miles from the\nsea.",
    "For those five or six miles it meandered first through a low valley flanked\nby the open downs on one side and by wooded heights on the other and then\nmade its way for the last four miles through a flat lowlying country till it\nEVERYONE\n\n\ffinally entered the Channel at Whynmouth.",
    "Everyone knows Whynmouth as a\nfavourite South Coast holiday resort possessing a small harbour at the mouth of\nits river.",
    "Twice a day the tide flowed up the Whyn more or less rapidly according to\nwhether it was \u201cspring\u201d or \u201cneap.\u201d And this fact had an important bearing on the\ntimes which were favourable for angling.",
    "On this particular morning Neddy\nWare had planned to be on the river bank a little while after the incoming tide\nhad begun to flow up the stream.",
    "Behold him then as he came out of his cottage halfway up the wooded\nslopes of \u201cLingham Hangar\u201d crossed the high road and made his way down to\nthe level of the river.",
    "He was fairly on in years but carried those years well so\nmuch so that there was only just a sprinkling of grey in his coalblack hair.",
    "A\nsturdylooking man cleanshaven but with a curious oldfashioned twist of hair\nallowed to grow long on either side of his head just in front of his ears brown\nweatherbeaten lined face humorous mouth and keen grey eyes.",
    "Dressed in an\nold navy blue serge suit and wearing\u2014as he invariably did\u2014a black bowler hat.",
    "Carrying rods landing net and a capacious basket containing all kinds of the\nimpedimenta of his craft.",
    "He reached the grassy bank of the river put his things on the ground and very\nslowly filled a blackened clay pipe with twist tobacco\u2014which he rubbed in his\nhands first\u2014and proceeded to light it glancing up and down the river as he did\nso.",
    "Where he was standing the river took a curve and he was on the outer side of\nthis curve on the right bank.",
    "Away to the left the stream bent itself between the\nheights on the one side and open meadows on the other.",
    "To the right bending\naway from him was the flat country the river\u2019s edges bordered with tallgrowing reeds.",
    "From this direction the tide was flowing towards him swirling\nround the bend.",
    "His first task was to haul in three or four eel lines he had thrown out the\nevening before the ends being tied to the gnarled roots of a small tree growing\non the bank.",
    "Two of the lines brought to land a couple of fairsized eels and\nvery dexterously he detached the slippery twisting fish from the hooks washing\nthe slime off afterwards.",
    "Then slowly he commenced putting one of his rods\ntogether arranging his tackle baiting with worms and casting into the stream.",
    "For some little time he watched the float bobbing about in the swirl of the\neddies now and again striking when it suddenly disappeared beneath the\nsurface once landing a fish.",
    "He glanced around.",
    "Suddenly his float lost interest.",
    "He was gazing downstream as far as he could see around the bend.",
    "Slowly a small rowingboat was\n\n\fcoming upstream.",
    "But there was something peculiar about her.",
    "No oars were in\nevidence.",
    "She appeared to be drifting.",
    "The old sailor was quick to recognise the little craft.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d he muttered \u201cthat\u2019s the Vicar\u2019s boat.\u201d\nLingham Vicarage stood with its adjacent church quite apart from the village\nproper about half a mile down the river.",
    "The grounds ran down to the water\u2019s\nedge where there was a rough landingstage.",
    "The Vicar he knew kept his boat\nat this stage moored by her painter to a convenient post.",
    "There was a little creek\nrunning into the grounds with a wooden boathouse but in the summer months\nespecially when the Vicar\u2019s two boys were home from school the boat was\ngenerally kept on the river itself.",
    "As it came nearer Ware laid down his rod.",
    "He could see now that there was\nsomeone in the boat\u2014not seated but apparently lying in the bottom of her\nastern.",
    "The boat was only about fifty yards away now.",
    "The swirl of the tide was\nbringing her round the outer side of the bend in the river but Neddy Ware who\nknew every current saw that she would pass beyond his reach.",
    "With the quick\naction of the sailor he did not waste an instant.",
    "Diving into his basket he\nproduced one of the coiled up eel lines with its heavy lead plummet.",
    "And then\nstood in readiness uncoiling the line and throwing the slack on the grass.",
    "On came the boat about a dozen yards from the bank.",
    "Skilfully he threw the\nplummet into her bows and then started walking along the bank upstream\ngently but steadily pulling on the line till at length he brought her close up to\nthe bank and laid hold of the painter at her bows.",
    "The end of the painter was\ndragging in the water.",
    "As he pulled it out he glanced at it.",
    "It had been cut.",
    "He made it fast to a treeroot.",
    "The boat swung round stern upstream\nalongside the bank.",
    "And Ware got into her.",
    "The next moment he was on his\nknees bending over the man who lay in the stern.",
    "He lay there on his back his knees slightly hunched up his arms at his sides\nquite still.",
    "A man of about sixty with irongrey hair moustache and closecropped pointed beard dark eyes open with fixed stare.",
    "He was clad in evening\ndress clothes and a brown overcoat the latter open at the front and exposing a\nwhite shirtfront stained with blood.",
    "Sitting on one of the seats Ware made a swift examination of the boat.",
    "A pair of oars lay in her the metal rowlocks were unshipped.",
    "Apparently the\ndead man was hatless\u2014no\u2014there was a hat in the boat lying in the bows a\nround black clerical hat such as Mr. Mount the Vicar usually wore.",
    "Neddy Ware having looked around got out of the boat and glanced at his\nwatch.",
    "Ten minutes to five.",
    "Then leaving the little craft moored to the bank he\n\n\fhurried off as fast as he could go gained the high road which was some hundred\nyards away from the river and started in the direction of the village.",
    "Police Constable Hempstead just on the point of turning into bed after having\nbeen on duty all night looked out of the window in answer to Ware\u2019s knock at\nthe door.",
    "\u201cWhat is it Mr. Ware\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cSomething pretty bad I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\nHempstead wide awake now slipped on his clothes again came down and\nopened the door.",
    "Ware told him what had happened.",
    "\u201cI must get the Inspector out from Whynmouth\u2014and a doctor\u201d said the\nconstable \u201cI\u2019ll phone to the station there.\u201d\nHe came out again in two or three minutes.",
    "\u201cAll right\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019ll run over in a car at once.",
    "Now you come along\nwith me and show me that boat and what\u2019s in it.",
    "You haven\u2019t been messing\nabout with anything\u2014moving the body and so on I hope\u201d\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be such a fool\u201d replied Ware.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all right.",
    "You haven\u2019t seen anyone else\u201d\n\u201cNo one.\u201d\nThe policeman went on asking questions from time to time as they hurried\nalong.",
    "He was a smart man this young constable eager for his stripes and\nwanted to make the most of the opportunity.",
    "As soon as they reached the river\nbank he took a glance at the boat and its contents and exclaimed\n\u201cHullo Don\u2019t you know who that is Mr. Ware\u201d\n\u201cNever saw him before that I know of.",
    "Who is he\u201d\n\u201cWhy it\u2019s Admiral Penistone.",
    "He lives at Rundel Croft\u2014that big house the\nother side of the river just opposite the Vicarage.",
    "Leastways he\u2019s been in\nresidence there about a month.",
    "He only bought it last June.",
    "A newcomer.\u201d\n\u201cOh Admiral Penistone is he\u201d said Neddy Ware.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the man right enough.",
    "But look here are you sure this is the\nVicarage boat\u201d\n\u201cCertain.\u201d\n\u201cQueer eh That seems to mean something happened this side of the river for\nof course there\u2019s no bridge till you get to Fernton\u2014three miles lower down.",
    "Ah\nand the parson\u2019s hat eh Let\u2019s see what time did you first see the boat coming\nalong\u201d\n\u201cA little after halfpast four I should say.\u201d\nHempstead had his notebook out and was making pencilled jottings in it.",
    "Then\nhe said\n\u201cLook here Mr. Ware I want you if you will to go back to the road and stop\n\n\fInspector Rudge when he comes along in his car.\u201d\n\u201cVery well\u201d replied Ware \u201cnothing more I can do\u201d\n\u201cNot yet at any rate.\u201d\nHempstead was an astute man.",
    "He waited until Neddy Ware was out of the\nway before he began a little examination on his own account.",
    "He knew very well\nthat his superior officer would take the case fully in hand but he was anxious to\nsee what he could without disturbing anything in the meantime.",
    "As he got into the boat he noticed a folded newspaper half sticking out of the\ndead man\u2019s overcoat pocket.",
    "He took it out gingerly looked at it and replaced\nit.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d he murmured \u201cthe Evening Gazette last night\u2019s late London edition.",
    "He wouldn\u2019t get that here.",
    "The nearest place where it\u2019s sold is Whynmouth.\u201d\nHe would very much have liked to examine the contents of all the pockets of\nthe dead man\u2019s clothes but felt he had better not.",
    "So he got out of the boat sat\ndown on the bank and waited.",
    "After a bit the sound of a car running along the main road was heard and in a\nminute or two four men came across the meadow Neddy Ware a police\ninspector in uniform and two men in plain clothes one of them a doctor the\nother a detectivesergeant.",
    "Inspector Rudge was a tall thin man with sallow cleanshaven face.",
    "He came\nup to Hempstead.",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t moved anything\u201d he asked curtly.",
    "\u201cNo sir.\u201d\nRudge turned to the doctor.",
    "\u201cI won\u2019t do anything Doctor Grice till you have made your examination.\u201d\nDoctor Grice got into the boat and proceeded to examine the body.",
    "It was only\na few minutes before he said\n\u201cStabbed to the heart Inspector with some narrowbladed instrument\u2014a thin\nknife or dagger.",
    "Death must have been instantaneous.",
    "There\u2019ll have to be a postmortem of course.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has he been dead\u201d\n\u201cSome hours.",

    "I\u2019ll have a look now.\u201d\nHe turned the body over shifting it slightly.",
    "\u201cNo sign of blood under him\u201d he said \u201cor anywhere else in the boat that I can\nsee.",
    "Let\u2019s have a look in his pockets\u2014ah it wasn\u2019t robbery.",
    "Gold watch and\nchain\u2014wallet full of notes\u2014they were not after that.",
    "Evening paper here\u2014last\n\n\fnight\u2019s date.",
    "That must be noted.",
    "Now\u2014we\u2019ve got to be as quick as possible.",
    "Tell me Hempstead what do you know about him\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s Admiral Penistone sir.",
    "Retired.",
    "A newcomer hereabouts.",
    "Bought\nRundel Croft a big house on the other side of the river a few months ago.",
    "Took\nup residence there lately.",
    "I believe he has a niece living with him.",
    "But it\u2019s not in\nmy district sir.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nThe Inspector turned to Ware.",
    "\u201cYou say the boat belongs to the Vicar here\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHow long would it take for the tide to bring it up from his place\u201d\n\u201cForty to fortyfive minutes\u201d replied Ware promptly \u201cwith the tide as it is today.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "Now the question is how are we to move him We might pull the boat\nback against the tide.",
    "Won\u2019t do though.",
    "Those oars must be tested for fingerprints before they are handled.",
    "Let\u2019s see\u2014Vicarage on the telephone\nHempstead\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.",
    "I\u2019ll go there now.",
    "I want to see the Vicar.",
    "We\u2019ll phone to\nWhynmouth for an ambulance.",
    "Have to run him to Rundel Croft round by\nFernton Bridge.",
    "You remain here Hempstead and if anyone comes along don\u2019t\nlet \u2019em touch anything.",
    "I shall want you Sergeant\u2014we\u2019ll have to put you across\nthe river from the Vicarage if we can get a boat there I want you to mount guard\nover the Admiral\u2019s boat and boathouse.",
    "Perhaps you won\u2019t mind coming too\nMr. Ware.",
    "You may be useful.",
    "There We\u2019ll get a move on.",
    "Come along\nDoctor.\u201d\nIn a very short time the Inspector was driving the car down the short bit of\nroad leading from the highway to the Vicarage.",
    "The front door of the latter faced\nthe river a lawn stretching down to the bank.",
    "Opposite about a hundred yards\nfrom the bank stood a large redbrick Tudor mansion with a broad sweep of\nlawn in front and a boathouse.",
    "The Inspector the Vicar\u2019s hat in his hand got out of the car and rang the bell\nthe others followed.",
    "It was a few minutes before the maid who evidently had\nonly just come down opened the door and said her master was not up yet.",
    "\u201cWill you kindly tell him that Inspector Rudge wants to see him at once.",
    "Say\nI\u2019m sorry to disturb him but it\u2019s most important.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him sir.",
    "Won\u2019t you come in\u201d\n\u201cThank you no.",
    "I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d\n\u201cHullo I say are you a policeman\u201d\n\n\fHe turned.",
    "Two boys had come across the lawn aged respectively about\nsixteen and fourteen dressed in flannel trousers and shirts open at the neck and\ncarrying bathing towels.",
    "They were regarding him eagerly.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said \u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cGood egg\u201d exclaimed the elder \u201cjust what we want isn\u2019t he Alec Look\nhere some blighter has taken our boat\u2014cut the painter.",
    "Perhaps you\u2019ve heard\nabout it though Is that what you\u2019ve come about\u201d\nThe Inspector smiled grimly.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014that\u2019s what I\u2019ve come about young gentlemen\u201d he replied dryly \u201cbut\nyou needn\u2019t worry about your boat.",

    "\u201cGot the beggar who took it\u201d\n\u201cNot yet\u201d said Rudge with another grim little smile \u201cthat may not be so\neasy.",
    "Have you got another boat handy\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cOnly our old punt\u2014she\u2019s in the boathouse.\u201d\n\u201cWell do you two young gentlemen think you could manage to put my\ndetectivesergeant here across the water in her He wants to pay a call at Rundel\nCroft.\u201d\n\u201cRather\u201d Peter Mount looked with boyish admiration at the sergeant.",
    "\u201cIs\nthere going to be a manhunt Cheerio We\u2019ll help you.",
    "But you don\u2019t suspect\nold Admiral Penistone of sneaking our boat do you He crossed back in his own\nlast night.",
    "He\u2019d been dining here you know.\u201d\n\u201cOh had he\u201d said the Inspector.",

    "Is this your hat\u201d\nThe Vicar took it and looked at it.",
    "\u201cYes certainly it is.\u201d\n\u201cThen would you mind telling me if you remember when you had it last\u201d\n\u201cThat is quite simple.",

    "My neighbour who\n\n\flives opposite was dining with us last evening with his niece.",
    "They left just\nabout ten.",
    "I went down to the river to see them off and put my hat on.",
    "After the\nAdmiral had crossed the stream in his boat with his niece I sat down in that little\nsummerhouse and smoked a pipe.",
    "I took off my hat and laid it on the seat beside\nme\u2014and absentmindedly I forgot to put it on again when I returned to the\nhouse.",
    "It was then that I set my watch by the clock in the hall\u2014twenty minutes\npast ten.",
    "But will you tell me why you ask me this\u2014and what you have all come\nabout\u201d\n\u201cI will sir.",
    "This hat was found in your boat early this morning.",
    "Your boat was\ndrifting with the tide upstream.",

    "\u201cAnd you yourself stayed out\nsmoking until\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTwenty past ten.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then\u201d\n\u201cI locked the house up and went to bed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you heard nothing more of your neighbour\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u201d said the Vicar.",
    "\u201cNothing at all\u201d he repeated more loudly.",
    "\u201cWhat about your sons Or your servants Would they have heard anything\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.",
    "They had all gone to bed when I came in.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.",
    "Now Mr. Mount can you tell me this Did Admiral Penistone\nseem in his usual spirits during the evening\u201d\nThe question appeared to distress the Vicar.",
    "\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t think I can really\nanswer that\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou see I haven\u2019t known the Admiral at all long.",
    "He has\n\n\fonly recently come to the neighbourhood.",
    "\u2026 I really hardly know him.\u201d\n\u201cBut still\u201d Rudge persisted \u201cyou might have noticed if he seemed distressed\nor worried in any way.",
    "Did he\u201d And seeing the Vicar still hesitated he pressed\nhis point.",
    "\u201cIf you did notice anything Mr. Mount I really think you should tell\nme.",
    "It\u2019s of the highest importance that we should find out everything we can\nabout the poor gentleman\u2019s state of mind at the time\u2014and I assure you I know\nhow to be discreet.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said the Vicar fidgeting a little.",
    "\u201cWell \u2026 it\u2019s nothing probably.",
    "But I\nshould say\u2014yes\u2014that the Admiral was perhaps a little worried.",
    "He was not as\n\u2014as amiable as usual.",
    "And he was generally a very pleasant man\u2014not at all\nsnappish.\u201d\n\u201cHe was snappish with Miss Fitzgerald perhaps\u201d the Inspector suggested\nquickly and the Vicar blinked.",
    "\u201cOh no \u2026 hardly \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say that at all.\u201d\n\u201cBut he acted as though there was something on his mind.",
    "\u2026 I suppose\nyou\u2019ve no idea what it was\u201d\n\u201cI think\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014it may have been his niece\u2019s marriage.",
    "He said\nsomething about it.",
    "Nothing much.\u201d\n\u201cOh she\u2019s getting married is she Who to\u201d\n\u201cSomebody called Holland Arthur Holland.",
    "From London I think.",
    "I don\u2019t\nknow him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Admiral Penistone didn\u2019t approve\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean that.",
    "I mean I don\u2019t know.",
    "He didn\u2019t say.",
    "Only he seemed as\nthough something might have gone a little wrong.",
    "Perhaps it was to do with her\nsettlements she has a good deal of money as I understand and the Admiral is\u2014\nwas her trustee.",
    "But I really don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "Had you yourself known Admiral Penistone long\u201d\n\u201cOnly since he came here about a month ago.",
    "I called on him you know and\nwe got acquainted.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you saw each other fairly often\u201d\n\u201cOh two or three times in the week perhaps.",

    "I don\u2019t remember his ever telling me the\ndistrict.",
    "I don\u2019t think he knew many people about here well.",
    "Sir Wilfrid Denny\n\n\fover at West End saw most of him I fancy.",
    "I believe he had old friends down to\nmeet him sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cEver meet any of them yourself\u201d\n\u201cOh no\u201d said the Vicar.",
    "\u201cI see.",
    "Well I think I\u2019d better be getting over to his place now\u201d the Inspector\nsaid.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m very much obliged to you Mr. Mount.",
    "I\u2019ll want to have a word with\nyour sons and your servants some time just in case any of them noticed anything\nthat might help us.",
    "But that can wait.",
    "By the way\u201d he turned at the door to add\n\u201ccan you tell me what sort of a young lady Miss Fitzgerald is Liable to\u2014to be\nvery upset I mean\u201d\nThe Vicar smiled a little almost in spite of himself.",
    "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think so\u201d he\nsaid.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think Miss Fitzgerald is at all the fainting type.\u201d\n\u201cVery devoted to her uncle eh\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say particularly.",
    "About as much as most nieces are to their uncles\nI imagine.",
    "Perhaps she is rather a reserved young woman\u2014has interests of her\nown.",
    "But this is just gossip\u2014you can see for yourself what you think\nInspector.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true enough.",
    "Well I\u2019ll be going\u201d the Inspector said and noted the\nexpression of relief which overspread the Vicar\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cI know we aren\u2019t\npopular visitors\u201d he thought to himself \u201cat the best of times.",
    "But need he show\nquite so plainly how glad he is to get rid of me I wonder if there could be any\nother reason\u2014if he knows anything more than he\u2019s said.",
    "But\u2014the Vicar of\nLingham and a most respectable Vicar from all I\u2019ve ever heard of him I must\nsay it doesn\u2019t sound likely.\u201d And so thinking he made his way back to the car\nand drove rapidly the three miles or so which he had to cover to reach the house\na hundred yards away.",
    "It was close on eight o\u2019clock by the time he reached his destination but\nRundel Croft obviously did not keep early hours.",
    "One or two of the windows\nfacing him still had their blinds down and the hall when he was admitted to it\nwas obviously undergoing its matutinal cleanup.",
    "A rather downatheels butler\nof the type which seems to have become a butler because its wife is a good cook\nand itself has no special ability of any kind opened the door to him and blinked\nuneasily in his face.",
    "Rudge asked for Miss Fitzgerald and was told that she was\nnot yet about.",
    "Apparently she always breakfasted in bed.",
    "Rudge then asked for\nAdmiral Penistone.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s in his room still\u201d the butler said looking faintly hostile as though he\ndid not approve of early morning visitors.",
    "\u201cNo he isn\u2019t\u201d Rudge said sharply.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s had an accident.\u201d The butler\ngoggled at him.",

    "Admiral Penistone has met with a very serious accident\n\u2014in fact he\u2019s dead.",
    "Will you find Miss Fitzgerald\u2019s maid if she has one and\ntell her that I want to speak to Miss Fitzgerald as soon as she can possibly come\ndown.",
    "And come back here when you\u2019ve done it.",
    "I want a word with you.\u201d\nWith no more than an inarticulate noise the butler shuffled off and it was ten\nminutes or so before he returned with the news that Miss Fitzgerald would be\ndown in a quarter of an hour.",
    "The Inspector took him aside into a square rather\nbeautiful morningroom and began questioning him about his master\u2019s\nmovements of the night before.",
    "But he got very little help from his interview.",
    "It\nseemed to him that the man must be either phenomenally stupid or else dazed\nwith shock at his master\u2019s death and yet the latter did not seem to be the case.",
    "Beyond a muttering or two of \u201cDear dear\u201d and the like he hardly appeared to\nhave taken in the news and the Inspector felt some surprise that a retired naval\nofficer should keep so incompetentlooking a servant.",
    "Yet the house appeared\nwell cleaned if it did rouse itself somewhat late in the day.",
    "Admiral Penistone the Inspector learned had last been seen by his staff at\nabout a quarter past seven on the previous evening when he and his niece had\ngone down to the boathouse to row themselves over to the Vicarage.",
    "He never\nallowed anyone to disturb him in the morning until he rang which accounted for\nhis absence being unknown.",
    "As he was going to the boathouse he had told\nEmery that he need not wait up but was to lock the front of the house and go to\nbed leaving the french window of the drawingroom which led to the lawn and\nthe river unbolted.",
    "\u201cI was to lock it\u201d Emery said \u201cbut Admiral Penistone\nalways had his own key.\u201d\n\u201cStop a moment.",
    "Was this window bolted when you came down this morning\nor not\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d Emery said but added that that didn\u2019t mean anything.",
    "Half the time the\nAdmiral didn\u2019t bolt it.",
    "It was locked and nobody was likely to come burgling\nfrom the riverside.",
    "Then he hadn\u2019t seen the Admiral again No.",
    "Or Miss Fitzgerald Yes so to\nspeak.",
    "He meant that as he and his wife were going up to bed a bit after ten\nmight have been quarterpast they\u2019d seen Miss Fitzgerald coming up the path\nfrom the boathouse.",
    "At least they\u2019d seen her dress they couldn\u2019t see her\nproperly in the dark.",
    "The Admiral wasn\u2019t with her then but they supposed he\nwas behind locking up the boathouse.",
    "No he didn\u2019t know if the boathouse was\nlocked now he supposed it was but it wasn\u2019t his work to go down to the boathouse.",
    "No he couldn\u2019t say they\u2019d actually seen Miss Fitzgerald come in she\n\n\fmight have or she might have stopped on the lawn.",
    "He and his wife weren\u2019t\nparticularly noticing they were going to bed.",
    "And that was all Emery had to say.",
    "Questioned about his late master\u2019s mood\nof the previous evening he seemed to have no idea and simply stared with a\nmoonfaced imbecility.",
    "He \u201csupposed he was much as usual.\u201d The Admiral was\noccasionally \u201cshort\u201d with his servants the Inspector reflected that it would take\na saint not to be short with Emery at least a dozen times a day but beyond that\nhis butler had nothing to say.",
    "Masters apparently were phenomena that were\noccasionally short like pastry but one accepted the fact and did not conjecture\nabout the cause.",
    "At least not if one were as limp and uninterested as Emery\nappeared.",
    "No his wife and he had only been a month with the Admiral they had\napplied for the post from an advertisement they were last with a lady and\ngentleman in Hove for a year and a half.",
    "At this point somewhat to Rudge\u2019s\nrelief a much more intelligentlooking maidservant appeared and announced\nthat Miss Fitzgerald was awaiting him in the diningroom.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s ugly\u201d was the Inspector\u2019s immediate reaction on first beholding the\nniece of the late Admiral Penistone.",
    "And then \u201cNo I\u2019m not so sure that she\nwould be in some lights.",
    "But she\u2019d take a good bit of makingup I shouldn\u2019t\nwonder.",
    "And jiminy isn\u2019t she sulkylooking\u201d\nMiss Elma Fitzgerald was very pale.",
    "But it was not the pallor of fear for a\npossible accident to her uncle but that peculiar to a very thick opaque skin.",
    "She\nwas big and heavilymade with long limbs and broad shoulders and would have\nbeen better suited obviously by long trailing draperies than by the tweed skirt\nand jumper which she had rather carelessly put on.",
    "She had largish stronglymarked but roughlydesigned features with a wide jaw and full chin and dark\nbrows nearly meeting in her white face.",
    "Her hair was dark and coarse done in\nflat plaits around her ears and under her eyes which were so little open that the\nInspector could not at first glance determine their colour were lines and dark\npouches.",
    "She was to him distinctly unattractive and \u201ca year or two over thirty\u201d\nwas he thought a generous description.",
    "Yet she was certainly a woman of\npersonality and in a kinder light and with artificial aids to lighten her skin and\nhide the disfiguring lines she might even have been attractive.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d she said in a voice that contrived to have a rasp and a drawl\nsimultaneously.",
    "\u201cWhat do you want\u201d At any rate the Inspector thought she\nwas not going to waste his time.",
    "\u201cI am sorry to have to tell you Miss Fitzgerald\u201d said he \u201cthat Admiral\nPenistone has met with a serious accident.\u201d\n\u201cIs he dead\u201d The tone was so matteroffact that the Inspector jumped\nslightly.",
    "\u201cI am afraid he is.",
    "But did you\u2014were you expecting\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Still she had not raised her eyes.",
    "\u201cBut that\u2019s the way the police\nalways break things to one don\u2019t they What happened\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say\u201d said the Inspector \u201cthat the Admiral was murdered.\u201d\n\u201cMurdered\u201d At that the eyes did open wide for a moment.",
    "They were grey\nvery dark grey.",
    "They would have been fine eyes Rudge noted if the lashes had\nbeen longer.",
    "\u201cBut\u2014why\u201d\nAs that was exactly what the Inspector wanted to know himself he was\nmomentarily brought to a stop.",
    "\u201cHis body was found\u201d he said \u201cat halfpast four this morning drifting in a\nboat upstream and stabbed to the heart.\u201d Miss Fitzgerald merely bowed her\nhead in acquiescence and seemed waiting for him to continue.",
    "\u201cDamn her\u201d the\nInspector thought.",
    "\u201cHasn\u2019t she got any natural feelings You\u2019d think I\u2019d told her\nthere was a cat on the lawn\u201d Aloud he said \u201cI\u2019m afraid this must come as a\ngood deal of a shock to you madam.\u201d\n\u201cYou need not consider my feelings Inspector\u201d said Elma Fitzgerald with a\nglance which said more plainly than words \u201cAnd it is a gross impertinence on\nyour part to make any enquiries into them\u201d \u201cI suppose you have some idea why\n\u2014this happened Or who did it\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid I don\u2019t see it very clearly yet\u201d the Inspector said.",
    "\u201cI wondered\u2014\nif you could \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u201d said Miss Fitzgerald with decision.",
    "\u201cI haven\u2019t any idea\u201d\u2014she spoke\nslowly\u2014\u201cwhy anyone\u2014anyone at all\u2014should want to kill my uncle.",
    "I suppose\n\u2014\u201d But the sentence stopped there.",
    "Whatever it was she supposed the Inspector\nwait as he might was not to be privy to it.",
    "\u201cWhat do you want me to tell you\u201d\nshe continued at length.",
    "\u201cI wish you\u2019d be quick and go about your business\u201d\nher voice conveyed.",
    "\u201cJust this madam\u201d the Inspector said.",
    "\u201cWhen did you last see Admiral\nPenistone\u201d\n\u201cLast night.",
    "When we came back from dining at the Vicarage.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time would that be\u201d The Inspector believed in getting his information\nconfirmed from as many sources as possible.",
    "\u201cOh \u2026 a little after ten I think.",
    "It struck ten just before we left.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you rowed across and came up to the house with the Admiral\u201d\n\u201cNo he didn\u2019t come up to the house when I did.",
    "He was locking the boathouse and he said he thought he\u2019d like a cigar before he went to bed.",
    "So I said\ngood night to him and came straight up to the house.\u201d\n\u201cWas there anyone about when you came in\u201d \u201cNo but Emery and his wife\nhad only just gone to bed I think.",
    "I saw the lights going on and off as I came up.",
    "They must have been shutting up the house.\u201d \u201cAnd then\u2014what did you do\u201d\n\u201cI came straight up and went to bed myself.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear Admiral Penistone come in\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "But I wasn\u2019t listening particularly.",
    "He often stays up quite late walking\nabout\u201d said Miss Fitzgerald.",
    "\u201cI gather\u201d said the Inspector \u201cthat Admiral Penistone last night appeared\nrather worried and distressed\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.",
    "\u2026 No.",
    "Why should he have been\u201d\n\u201cYou hadn\u2019t had a\u2014a disagreement with him at all\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u201d said Miss Fitzgerald with disconcerting penetration \u201cabout my\nmarriage.",
    "That\u2014is\u2014pure\u2014gossip.\u201d There was a considerable amount of\ncontempt in her tone.",
    "\u201cMy uncle was not in the least opposed to my marriage.",
    "He was a little worried I believe about the best way of arranging the money\nside of it\u2014but that was only a question which would settle itself in time.",
    "That\nwas all.\u201d But there must be a little more to it the Inspector swiftly reflected or\nshe wouldn\u2019t have tumbled so quick to what I was talking about.",
    "\u201cThen you can\u2019t suggest at all what was worrying him\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think for a moment there was anything\u201d said Miss Fitzgerald and\nmade a slight movement that at least suggested a gesture of dismissal.",
    "\u201cI see.",
    "Well \u2026\u201d The Inspector would have liked to continue the interview but\ndid not see at the moment exactly what other information he could well\ndemand.",
    "And it was perhaps hardly in the best of taste to sit there pestering a\nlady in her first grief\u2014if she was grieved.",
    "There was a sudden twitch of a strong\nrather large hand that suggested more emotion than appeared on the surface at\nany rate.",
    "\u201cJust one more thing Miss Fitzgerald and then I need not trouble you\nfurther.",
    "Can you give me the name of Admiral Penistone\u2019s lawyers\u201d\n\u201cDakers and Dakers.",
    "They live somewhere in Lincoln\u2019s Inn I think.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.",
    "And if I could see Admiral Penistone\u2019s papers now\u2014and the\nservants\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI think all his papers are in the study.",
    "Emery will show you.\u201d Miss Fitzgerald\nleaned across and touched the bell.",
    "\u201cInspector\u201d she said a little suddenly \u201cwill\nyou tell me\u2014what happens Will they be bringing him\u2014here\u201d It was the first\ntrace of real emotion her voice had shown and Rudge hastened to assure her that\nthe body would be taken to the mortuary and that every effort would be made to\nspare her as much as possible.",
    "\u201cThank you\u201d she said returning to indifference again and at that moment\nEmery shuffled in.",
    "\u201cEmery take the Inspector to the Admiral\u2019s study and let\nhim see anything he wants to.",
    "And you\u2019d better none of you go out of the house.",
    "The Inspector may want to speak to you.\u201d She leaned back in her chair and\n\n\fmade no movement as Rudge looking he hoped not as puzzled as he felt\nfollowed Emery out of the room.",
    "The Admiral\u2019s study was a large and pleasant room on the first floor looking\nout upon the lawn and the river.",
    "It was in fairly good order though it had\nobviously not been cleaned this morning and there were a few papers dating\nprobably from the previous evening lying untidily upon the desk.",
    "Rudge took in\nthe appearance of the room with a practised eye and reflected that it ought not to\ntake long to make it yield up any secrets it possessed.",
    "Then he dismissed the\nhovering Emery.",
    "\u201cAnd you\u2019re not to let anybody into the house for the present\nplease without asking me about it\u201d were his final instructions.",
    "Emery with a\nmuttered \u201cVery good\u201d shuffled off again.",
    "The desk and a small filing cabinet which stood beside it were the only likely\nreceptacles for papers in the room.",
    "The filing cabinet when opened disclosed\nnothing but newspaper cuttings neatly sorted.",
    "The desk was locked but Rudge\nhad prudently possessed himself of the dead man\u2019s keys and he very soon had it\nopen.",
    "The first thing which he found was a pistol perfectly clean and fully\nloaded lying all by itself in a little drawer.",
    "He formed his mouth into the shape\nof a soundless whistle and proceeded to unearth writingpaper and envelopes a\ndrawer full of pipes another with a few letters of recent date another with bankbooks stubends of chequebooks incometax forms and other financial\nparaphernalia and a fifth which contained only a large legal envelope inscribed\nElma Fitzgerald.",
    "In view of what the Vicar had said the Inspector conjectured\nthat the contents of this envelope might possibly have some bearing upon his\ncase and he settled himself down to study them as a preliminary.",
    "The first item\nwas the \u201cLast Will and Testament of John Martin Fitzgerald\u201d bulky and wordy\nbeyond even the normal run of such documents and the Inspector whose\nmastery of legal jargon was not as thorough as he could have wished found\nsome trouble in disentangling its provisions.",
    "He had succeeded in making out\nthat John Martin Fitzgerald was the Admiral\u2019s brotherinlaw and that his will\ndevised his property whatever that might be in equal proportions to his son\nWalter Everett Fitzgerald \u201cif he should be found to be alive at the date of my\ndeath\u201d and his daughter Elma Fitzgerald and had noted that if the son turned\nout to be dead \u201cI suppose he must have disappeared or something.",
    "It\u2019s a funny\nway to put it anyhow.\u201d Elma Fitzgerald would get all the property on her\nmarriage\u2014when his attention was arrested by what sounded like an altercation\nbelowstairs.",
    "For a moment or two he listened and judged that in spite of his\norders some visitor must be trying to force an entrance into the house.",
    "And as he\nstrongly mistrusted Emery\u2019s power to oppose even a determined fly he went\ndown into the hall to see what it was all about and found as he had anticipated\n\n\fa pink and perplexed butler feebly flapping at an enraged visitor who had\nalready penetrated as far as the foot of the stairs.",
    "\u201c\u2014the Inspector said\u2014\u201d he was bleating.",
    "\u201cTo hell with the Inspector\u201d the intruder retorted and glancing up found\nhimself looking straight into the eyes of the said Inspector\u2014a contingency\nwhich disconcerted him not at all.",
    "Nor need it have done so.",
    "Whoever he was the intruder was easily capable of\ndealing with a dozen inspectors.",

    "Above a pair of\nmagnificently broad shoulders was set a handsome head with sunburned face\nand neck a square chin and short aquiline nose brown hair cropped so close\nthat it could hardly indulge its natural curls and big fiery hazel eyes which\nglared up at Rudge with all the righteous indignation of a supporter of Law and\nJustice resenting the interference of Law with his own avocations.",

    "\u201cYes sir.",

    "I went to bed early.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps there would be someone who would be able to confirm what you say\nabout your movements sir\u201d\nThe Inspector\u2019s voice was casual\u2014too casual.",

    "Have you any idea where she\u2019s gone\u201d\n\u201cNot the slightest.\u201d\n\u201cBut when you were dashing off to find her just now you must have had some\nidea of where to look.\u201d\n\u201cShe might have gone to London.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you might be able to find her in London\u201d\n\u201cI might.\u201d\n\u201cThen perhaps it would be as well if you did and asked her to return here\nwithout delay.\u201d\nHolland nodded.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll tell her but she\u2019s likely to please herself about that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be wise if she pleases herself by coming back sir.",
    "You\u2019ll keep in touch\nwith us in any case won\u2019t you sir\u201d\nHolland halted with his hand on the door.",
    "\u201cDoes that mean that I\u2019m to be under observation or whatever you call it\u201d\n\u201cI shan\u2019t put a man on to watch you sir but I\u2019d like you to keep in touch.\u201d\nWith a grunt Miss Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cyoung man\u201d swung open the door and strode\nout of the room.",

    "\u201c\u2018Merton\u2019 they call you\u201d he said with a friendly smile.",
    "\u201cSounds a bit formal\nto me.",
    "I expect you\u2019ve got another name eh\u201d\n\u201cJennie\u2019s my Christian name sir.\u201d\n\u201cAh that\u2019s better.",
    "Well Jennie this is a sad affair and I don\u2019t want to upset\nyou more than I can help but I must just ask you a few questions about your\nemployers.",
    "You see I don\u2019t know anything of them not been here long have\nthey\u201d\n\u201cNo sir only about a month.\u201d\n\u201cWere you with them before they came here\u201d\n\u201cOh no I come from Whynmouth myself.",
    "I\u2019ve only been here three weeks.\u201d\n\u201cAh so Miss Fitzgerald didn\u2019t bring a maid with her when she came\u201d\n\u201cOh yes she did\u2014a French one\u2014Mademoiselle Blanc she called herself but\nMiss Fitzgerald called her C\u00e9lie.",
    "She didn\u2019t stay long\u2014told the other girls the\nplace was like a mortuary\u2014\u2018deadhouse\u2019 she called it\u2014I don\u2019t know whether\nshe meant Rundel Croft or Whynmouth but I suppose she thought it was dull.",
    "Anyway she packed up and went off without waiting for her month nor yet her\nwages so the girls say.",
    "Miss Fitzgerald had to go to Marlow\u2019s Agency for\nanother maid in a hurry and as they hadn\u2019t got one but they knew I\u2019d been in a\nmaid\u2019s situation but I\u2019m living with mother now\u2014she\u2019s not well\u2014they asked\nme and I consented to oblige.\u201d\nThe last sentence though rather involved had the merit of explaining the\nsituation.",
    "Inspector Rudge nodded.",
    "\u201cI see so you don\u2019t really know Miss Fitzgerald very well.\u201d\n\u201cNot so very but I\u2019m not blind.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure not.",
    "What did you see\u201d\n\u201cJust that they didn\u2019t look much like an uncle and niece to me.\u201d\n\u201cOh they didn\u2019t Why not\u201d\n\u201cThe way she spoke to him\u2014sharp and sarcastic\u2014more like a wife I should\nsay.",
    "Not that I mean there was anything wrong.\u201d\n\u201cBut he was old enough to be her uncle\u2014or her father wasn\u2019t he\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u2014if you think that matters.\u201d\n\u201cDid they seem fond of each other\u201d\n\u201cNot so as you\u2019d notice it.\u201d\n\u201cRather the reverse in fact\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell of course I really couldn\u2019t say.",
    "It\u2019s not my place to be with them\u2014\nonly with her.\u201d\nJennie evidently felt that she had said too much already.",
    "\u201cWell about her then.",
    "You knew that she was engaged to this Mr. Holland of\ncourse\u201d\n\u201cSo she told me.\u201d\n\u201cDid she seem to be in love with him\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see them together much\u201d\n\u201cNot so much.",
    "But I never saw them kissing or holding hands.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d Here evidently was significance\u2014a criterion.",
    "\u201cNow tell me Jennie did Miss Fitzgerald care about her appearance\u201d\nJennie stared.",
    "\u201cFunny your asking that sir.",
    "It always puzzled me.",
    "Sometimes she didn\u2019t and\nsometimes she did.",
    "She\u2019d be downright plain some days\u2014like she was this\nmorning\u2014and then she\u2019d take and do herself up till she looked real handsome.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when did she do that When her young man was coming\u201d\n\u201cI never could make out when she did or why she did\u2014but it wasn\u2019t for him.",
    "Last night she was lovely\u2014took over an hour to dress when she usually flung\nher things off and on in five minutes.",
    "That white dress she wore was her\nfavourite\u2014it was chiffon with an overcoat of cream lace she always wore a\ncoloured flower\u2014artificial\u2014with it.\u201d\n\u201cAh I\u2019d like to have a look at that dress sometime\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\nmentioned more than once.\u201d\n\u201cWell now that\u2019s another funny thing\u201d said Jennie who was now fully at her\nease\u2014as Rudge had intended.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s taken it with her She only told me to pack\nsleeping things and a change of underclothes and stockings but she must have\npacked that herself after I\u2019d done.\u201d\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t you take it away\u2014to brush or whatever you do to it\u2014when you\ncalled her this morning\u201d asked the Inspector fumbling with halfguessed\nmysteries.",
    "\u201cWell now there you are again I didn\u2019t call her before you came\u2014she likes\nto sleep late.",
    "But when I went to tell her you were here I went to pick up her\ndress and shoes and things to take away but she snapped at me fierce and told\nme to go away she wanted to get up.",
    "Of course I went but when she\u2019d come\ndown to see you I went back to get them\u2014and they were gone\u201d\n\u201cGone All the clothes she wore last night\u201d\n\u201cThe dress and shoes and stockings were.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you look for them\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOf course I did.",
    "They weren\u2019t anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why you think she took them with her\u201d\n\u201cWell she must have.",
    "Where else could they be\u201d\nInspector Rudge looked thoughtfully at the girl then nodded his head and\ndrew out the notebook which had not previously appeared at this interview.",
    "\u201cI see Jennie thank you.",
    "I won\u2019t keep you longer now.",
    "Don\u2019t tell anyone else\nabout that dress and things but have a good hunt and if you find them let me\nknow.\u201d\nWhen the girl had gone Inspector Rudge sat back in his chair and pondered\nwhat he had just heard.",
    "The maid\u2019s judgment as to the relations existing between\nElma Fitzgerald and her uncle and again between her and her fianc\u00e9 might be at\nfault the question of Miss Fitzgerald\u2019s spasmodic attention to her appearance\nwas at present beyond him but surely the disappearance of the dress and shoes\nwhich she had been wearing at the time of the tragedy\u2014or at any rate on the\nevening of the tragedy\u2014was significant Could she be in some way connected\nwith her uncle\u2019s death She had appeared neither surprised nor distressed when\nshe heard of it but if she had been guilty\u2014or even cognisant of it\u2014would she\nnot have feigned both However it was too early yet to indulge in surmise\u2014let\nalone theories there were many facts to be collected first.",
    "To begin with the newspaper.",
    "How had it come into the dead man\u2019s pocket\nRudge happened to know that the late London edition of the Evening Gazette did\nnot reach Whynmouth till 8.50\u2014the express by which incidentally Arthur\nHolland had arrived.",
    "No doubt a copy would be delivered at Rundel Croft but\nthat could not be till about 9 p.m. and the Admiral had left the house at 7.15 for\nhis dinner at the Vicarage.",
    "Unless he had got a copy from the Vicarage that\nseemed to imply that Penistone had returned to Rundel Croft after leaving the\nVicarage at 10 p.m.\u2014but then why was the paper in his overcoat pocket Had he\ngone back to fetch it in order to read it out of doors\u2014surely that was\ninconceivable Or had he on his way back to Rundel Croft met someone who\ngave him the paper\u2014not the delivery boy it was too late for that.",
    "Someone\nperhaps who had brought the paper out with him\u2014had brought it perhaps from\nLondon\u2014Arthur Holland for instance Holland who had spent the evening by\nthe seashore and then gone early to bed\u2014by himself.",
    "But here again was surmise\n\u2014facts were what he wanted.",
    "Rudge rang the bell.",
    "\u201cEmery did your master take in the late London Evening Gazette\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "Tolwhistle\u2019s boy brings it out of an evening\u2014gets here about nine.\u201d\n\u201cDid it get here last night\u201d\n\u201cYes sir\u201d said Emery a faint look of surprise on his stodgy face.",
    "\u201cWhere did you put it\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIn the hall sir.\u201d\n\u201cIs it still there\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\u201cGo and have a look and if it\u2019s not there find out whether it\u2019s been tidied\naway.\u201d\nLooking more surprised than ever Emery slouched out of the door.",
    "Rudge\nthought it would probably be ten minutes at least before the tortoiselike butler\nreturned so he reached for the telephone which stood upon the writingtable and\nput a call through to Tolwhistle\u2019s the Whynmouth stationer.",
    "The number was\nengaged and while he waited Rudge let his mind drift back to the missing dress.",
    "He remembered that when he sent Emery off to ask Miss Fitzgerald to come and\nsee him it was ten minutes before the butler returned and then it was with the\ninformation that Miss Fitzgerald would be down in a quarter of an hour.",
    "There\nwas in fact an interval of twentyfive minutes between his despatching his\nmessage and the arrival of Miss Fitzgerald.",
    "Did her appearance\u2014slovenly in the\nextreme\u2014justify or explain such a long delay Was it possible that the\nmysterious \u201cniece\u201d had spent part of the time in hiding the clothes she had \u2026 \nThe telephone bell trilled.",
    "\u201cTolwhistle\u2019s I want to speak to Mr. Tolwhistle please.",
    "That you Mr.\nTolwhistle Inspector Rudge here.",
    "I want some information quite confidential.",
    "Sounds trivial but isn\u2019t.",
    "Do you supply the Reverend Mount Vicar of Lingham\nwith newspapers You do.",
    "Does he have a late London Evening Gazette Left it\noff at the end of last year Said what Oh spoilt the morning\u2019s\u2014yes I see.",
    "Any\nchance of anyone else supplying him No you\u2019d have heard of it of course.",
    "Thank you Mr. Tolwhistle.",
    "Keep my questions to yourself.",
    "I\u2019ll explain them\nsome day.\u201d\nThat settled the question of whether the Admiral had got the paper from the\nVicarage there remained the two alternatives of his having come back to the\nhouse fetched his own paper and gone out again or having met someone\noutside who had for some reason given him the paper.",
    "Impatient at the long absence of Emery Rudge went to look for him.",
    "There\nwas no sign of the butler but Police Constable Hempstead was standing in the\nhall.",
    "\u201cI came to report that the body has been taken to the undertaker\u2019s sir.",
    "I\nformally handed it over and obtained a receipt.\u201d\nThe Inspector blinked.",
    "Here was efficiency carried to full stretch.",
    "\u201cRight\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThis house isn\u2019t in your district I think you said\u201d\n\u201cNo sir but the corpse was found in it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think it your duty to see that its presence is accounted for\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThat\u2019s for you to say sir.\u201d\nRudge grinned.",
    "He knew that this keeneyed young constable was itching to\nbe \u201cin\u201d the investigation.",
    "\u201cAll right\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s a job for you go down to the boathouse and find\nout from Sergeant Appleton whether he\u2019s found anything significant.",
    "No.",
    "I\u2019ll\ncome with you.",

    "Hempstead across the park to the boathouse.",

    "\u201cOne or two things sir.",
    "In the first place the body\u2019s clothes were almost dry\n\u2014the back quite dry.",
    "But there was a heavy dew last night.",
    "If he had been lying\nabout in grass or even in the boat since midnight Doctor Grice fixed the time\nof death you remember sir as before midnight wouldn\u2019t the clothes have been\nwet\u201d\nInspector Rudge eyed his companion with interest.",
    "\u201cFrom which you infer \u2026 \u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cThat the Admiral was killed indoors and kept indoors\u2014or at any rate under\ncover\u2014for some time after he was killed.\u201d\nThe Inspector was silent for so long that Hempstead began to fear that he had\nexceeded his duty.",
    "Just as they reached the boathouse however Rudge said\n\u201cThat\u2019s a neat point we\u2019ll talk about it later.",
    "Ah Appleton sorry to keep you\nwaiting.",

    "Nothing else No blood signs of\nstruggle footmarks fingerprints\u201d\n\u201cNo to the first two sir.",
    "There are one or two good footmarks I\u2019ve covered\nover with boards and there look to be plenty of fingerprints all over the boat and\nsculls.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to examine them later.",

    "\u201cImprove on that Hempstead\u201d\n\u201cThe other alternative is that the Vicar left it there himself sir and forgot he\nhad.\u201d\n\u201cHe stated positively that he had his hat on when he saw the Admiral off after\ndinner last night and that he left it on the seat in the summerhouse.\u201d\n\u201cBut supposing he went out in the boat after that sir\u201d\n\u201cAh you mean \u2026 well never mind what you mean.",

    "\u201cAnd the rowlocks were unshipped\u201d the Inspector added his quota of surmise\n\u201ceither because the body was dumped into the Vicar\u2019s boat from another and the\nboat then cut adrift or \u2026 to suggest that explanation eh Hempstead\u201d\n\u201cPossibly sir.\u201d\n\u201cNow can anyone explain why the body was found where it was and when it\nwas\u201d asked the Inspector adding to himself \u201cand if it was.\u201d\nSergeant Appleton brightened.",
    "\u201cYes sir\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI thought that out while I was waiting.",
    "If the murder was\ncommitted at midnight as Doctor Grice says and the boat cut adrift then it\nwould have gone right out to sea because the tide was at full ebb then.",
    "My\ntheory is that the murder was committed several miles upstream and that before\nthe boat reached Whynmouth the tide turned and it floated back to where it was\nfound.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time did the tide turn\u201d\n\u201cAccording to Mr. Ware sir\u201d said Hempstead \u201cit turned about 3.45 a.m.\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s work this out.",
    "He told us you remember Hempstead that it\nwould have taken forty to fortyfive minutes for the boat to get from the\nVicarage to the spot where he was when it reached him what time was that\u201d\n\u201cJust after 4.30 a.m. sir.\u201d\n\u201cThat means it left\u2014or passed\u2014the Vicarage at about 3.50 a.m.\u2014only five\nminutes after the tide turned\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right sir.\u201d\n\u201cThen that means that if it was set adrift from here or from the Vicarage it\n\n\fmust have been only just before 3.45 a.m.\u2014otherwise it couldn\u2019t have got back\nto where Ware found it by the time it did.",
    "But it\u2019s nearly light by 3.45\u2014they\nwouldn\u2019t have left it as late as that.",

    "For\nan hour or so before the turn the tide\u2019s so slack that it\u2019s barely running.",
    "It\u2019s\npossible that a boat might fetch up against the bank for quite a time.",
    "My theory\nas you know sir is that the body wasn\u2019t in the boat long enough for the dew to\nmake the clothes wet.",
    "I think it was set adrift from here about 2.30 or 3 a.m.",
    "If\nthe person who did it was a stranger to the place he might not think of the river\nbeing tidal\u2014he\u2019d expect the boat to float straight out to sea.",
    "But what happened\nwas that it floated a few hundred yards and then as the tide slackened drifted\ninto the bank at 3.45 when the tide turned it drifted off again and so floated up\non the flow till it reached the spot where Neddy Ware found it at half past four.\u201d\n\n\fCHAPTER IV\nBy Agatha Christie\nMAINLY CONVERSATION\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S a pretty good theory too\u201d said Rudge.",

    "\u201cIn my conversation with the Vicar he mentioned that he had seen Miss\nFitzgerald\u2019s white dress through the trees.\u201d\n\u201cAs she was going up to the house sir\u2014yes I remember his saying that.",
    "Anything fishy about that do you think sir\u201d\n\u201cNo I imagine it\u2019s perfectly possible.",

    "Anything strike you as odd about that\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014yes I suppose it is a little queer\u2014that the lady shouldn\u2019t have had\nanything warmer in the way of a wrap than a lace coat and that the Admiral\u2014\nyes sir I take your meaning.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you Sergeant to take a boat across to the Vicarage and ask\nthere if the Admiral was wearing a coat last night.\u201d\n\u201cRight sir.\u201d\nWhen the sergeant had departed the Inspector turned to Hempstead.",

    "It\u2019s put there apart from the\nhouse so that it won\u2019t interfere with the hotel visitors.",
    "They get their drinks in\nthe smokingroom and pay more for them too.",
    "It\u2019s the outside customers that\nuse the Shades fishermen and the like of that such as the gentlemen who use the\nsmokingroom wouldn\u2019t care to associate with.",
    "Not that there\u2019s anything amiss\nwith them bar that they\u2019re a bit free with their language sometimes.",
    "They\u2019re\npolite enough to me when I go in there in the mornings at opening time to see\nthat all\u2019s right and comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cAh so you heard about the murder in the Shades this morning did you Mrs.\nDavis\u201d suggested the Inspector.",
    "\u201cWhy that\u2019s just what I was going to tell you about\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Davis\nin a slightly hurt tone.",
    "\u201cBut you gentlemen in the police are all the same.",
    "You\u2019re\nso short with your questions that a body can hardly get a word in edgeways.",
    "As I\nINSPECTOR RUDGE\n\n\fwas going to say I was in there this morning when Billy the barman was taking\ndown the shutters and as soon as he unlocked the door in walked a couple of\nchaps with ambulance badges on.",
    "I asked them if there had been an accident and\nthey told me how Mr. Ware of Lingham had found the Admiral\u2019s body in the\nVicar\u2019s boat which was floating about with no one in sight.\u201d\nAt this moment as though in answer to Inspector Rudge\u2019s inward prayer an\nagitatedlooking cook appeared from the back regions and muttered something\nin Mrs. Davis\u2019s ear.",
    "\u201cWhy there now if it hadn\u2019t altogether slipped my\nmemory\u201d she exclaimed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve been so interested hearing you talk Inspector\nthat I\u2019ve never ordered the joint for lunch.",
    "You\u2019ll excuse me if I run off and see\nto it won\u2019t you Mr. Rudge\u201d\nThe Inspector waited till Mrs. Davis had disappeared then when he was\nsatisfied that she was out of hearing rang a bell marked \u201cPorter.\u201d In a few\nminutes a baldheaded individual hustled into the entrance hall still struggling\nwith the short jacket which he had hastily thrust on over his rolledup shirt\nsleeves.",
    "From his appearance he seemed to have been interrupted in the act of\nstoking the central heating system.",
    "He looked at Inspector Rudge enquiringly.",
    "\u201cYessir\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m Inspector Rudge and I came here to make certain enquiries.",
    "You knew\nAdmiral Penistone I believe\u201d\nThe man scratched his head.",
    "\u201cWell sir I can\u2019t rightly say as I knew him\u201d he\nreplied.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve only seen him once in my life and that was last night.",
    "Came in\nhere he did and asked for Mr. Holland.\u201d\nThe Inspector nodded.",
    "\u201cSo I believe.",
    "Now I\u2019m particularly anxious to know\nhow he was looking then.",
    "Did he seem worried or anxious or anything like\nthat\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t very well say sir.",
    "You see it was gone eleven and I was just\ngoing to shut up the house.",
    "Mrs. Davis is always telling me to be careful of the\ngas and there was only one light burning.",
    "The Admiral came just inside the\ndoor and stood where you might be standing now sir.",
    "\u2018Is Mr. Holland in\u2019 he\nasks sharp like.",
    "And almost before I had time to say he was in bed he said that\nit didn\u2019t matter and that he couldn\u2019t wait as he had a train to catch.",
    "He wasn\u2019t\nhere no more than a few seconds sir.",
    "He seemed in a hurry but I couldn\u2019t\nproperly see his face.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t have known who it was if he hadn\u2019t told me.\u201d\nAgain the Inspector nodded.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019d recognise him again if you saw him I\nsuppose\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cWell sir I might and I mightn\u2019t.",
    "I never got a proper sight of him as you\nmight say.\u201d\n\u201cOh well it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d said the Inspector carelessly.",
    "\u201cWas Mr. Holland\n\n\fin when Admiral Penistone called\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he was sir leastways his boots was outside his door.",
    "I saw\nthem when I went up to bed soon after.",
    "And he didn\u2019t come in later I know that\nfor a fact.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you be sure of that\u201d\n\u201cWhy sir because I locked the door as I always do round about halfpast\neleven.",
    "If anybody wants to get in after that they presses the bell which rings in\nmy room and I comes down and lets them in.",
    "And the bell didn\u2019t ring last night\nsir.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "And when is the door opened again\u201d\n\u201cI unbolts it first thing when I comes down in the morning sir round about\nsix that is.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you do after you unlock the door\u201d\n\u201cWhy sir I lights the kitchen fire and puts on the kettle for a cup of tea.\u201d\n\u201cDid you happen to see Mr. Holland this morning\u201d\n\u201cI was in the hall when he went out after breakfast sir.",
    "About nine o\u2019clock\nthat would have been.",
    "And he hasn\u2019t come back since at least not that I know\nof.\u201d\nThe sound of Mrs. Davis\u2019s voice rapidly growing in intensity as she returned\nfrom the back regions caused Rudge to beat a hasty retreat.",
    "He slipped out of\nthe hotel and began to walk towards the police station reviewing the scraps of\ninformation which he had picked up at the Lord Marshall and congratulating\nhimself upon having had the idea of interviewing Mrs. Davis.",
    "Gossip though she\nmight be her freelyexpressed opinions of people were based upon a certain\nnative shrewdness.",
    "The Inspector felt that he had already gained a valuable sidelight upon Sir Wilfrid Denny and that even the revelation of that curious episode\nin the Vicar\u2019s past might prove instructive.",
    "As to Holland Mrs. Davis\u2019s\nconviction that he was not the murderer was certainly wellgrounded if he had\nspent the night in the hotel.",
    "But of course the most interesting thing he had learnt was the alleged visit of\nAdmiral Penistone shortly after eleven last night.",
    "Unfortunately it was\nimpossible to decide whether the caller had been the Admiral or not.",
    "The\nporter\u2019s identification of him was obviously worthless.",
    "He did not know the\nAdmiral by sight he could not even undertake to recognise the caller again.",
    "Where in fact had been the Admiral He had last been seen shortly after ten by\nthe boathouse.",
    "That would have given him an hour to get to Whynmouth.",
    "Hardly time to have walked the distance and yet he was hardly likely to have\ntaken the car out.",
    "Had he done so somebody would have been sure to have\nheard him.",
    "Could he have come down in his boat Possibly if the tide had been\n\n\fflowing the right way.",
    "Inspector Rudge frowned.",
    "He was no seaman and he had begun to regard the\nvagaries of this infernal River Whyn as a personal affront to him.",
    "His idea of a\nselfrespecting river was a placid stream which knew its own mind and flowed\nalways in the same direction like say the Thames at Maidenhead.",
    "But the\nWhyn was mad subject like a lunatic to the influence of the moon and\nchanging the direction of its flow in obedience to some law which was past the\nInspector\u2019s comprehension.",
    "He decided that he would have to consult some\nexpert on that point.",
    "For the present he imagined that if the tide had been\nflowing down the river there was no reason why the Admiral should not have\ncalled at the Lord Marshall at the time stated.",
    "But on the other hand his behaviour there had been quite contrary to what the\nInspector had gathered of his character.",
    "He seemed to have been of a peremptory\nand determined nature.",
    "Rudge could not have imagined him walking into the\nplace with the intention of seeing Holland and then suddenly changing his mind\non the score that he had barely time to catch his train.",
    "It would have been more\nlike him to have stamped about the hall till Holland had been dragged from his\nbed.",
    "Unless\u2014yes\u2014that was a possibility.",
    "Suppose his visit to the hotel had been\nmerely to assure himself that Holland had arrived From the fact that the porter\nhad offered to go and see if he was in he would have known that he was staying\nin the house.",
    "Perhaps having ascertained this his object had been accomplished\nand the excuse about the train had been trumped up on the spur of the moment\nto account for his exit.",
    "He might not have wanted to see Holland just then.",
    "On the other hand if the visitor had not been the Admiral why had he given\nhis name To make it appear that the Admiral had been in Whynmouth at that\nparticular time This opened up a wide field for speculation in which one\ncentral fact was apparent.",
    "The visitor must have known something of Admiral\nPenistone\u2019s movements that evening.",
    "And therefore every effort must be made to\ntrace him.",
    "And what about Holland himself The Inspector was not at all satisfied on the\nsubject of that impulsive gentleman.",
    "Mrs. Davis may have been right in her\nconjecture that Miss Fitzgerald was not eager to marry him but he was by no\nmeans certain that she was equally right in her opinion that he was not the\nmurderer.",
    "There was no means of verifying his statement that he had spent the\nnight in the hotel.",
    "He could easily have slipped out during the confusion that\nappeared to have reigned before eleven and returned just after six in the\nmorning when the door was unlocked and the porter was busy with the kitchen\nfire.",
    "Had he done so and met the Admiral in Whynmouth or elsewhere The\n\n\fmore he considered the matter the wider the field of speculation seemed to\nextend before Rudge\u2019s vision.",
    "His original intention had been to drive out and see Sir Wilfrid Denny at West\nEnd after he had finished with Mrs. Davis.",
    "But the possible light which that\nloquacious lady had thrown upon the Admiral\u2019s movements decided him to defer\nthe visit.",
    "He had formed the rudiments of a theory as to the time and place of the\nmurder but the possibility of this theory depended upon the tides in the River\nWhyn and upon this subject he must seek expert advice.",
    "Why not have another\nchat with Neddy Ware He knew the tides as no one else did his hobby had\nrendered a study of them absolutely necessary to him.",
    "And besides there was\nalways the chance that he might have observed some detail which he had not\nrecollected in the first excitement of his discovery.",
    "Inspector Rudge turned his car towards Lingham once more and very soon\nreached Ware\u2019s cottage.",
    "The old man was at home smoking his pipe\ncontemplatively after his midday meal.",
    "He greeted the Inspector hospitably and\nthe two sat down in a room decorated with models of ships and faded\nphotographs of the vessels in which Ware had served.",
    "\u201cYou want to know about the tides in the river\u201d he replied in answer to the\nInspector\u2019s explanation of the cause of his visit.",
    "\u201cWhy they\u2019re simple enough\nso long as you remember that it\u2019s high water Full and Change at Whynmouth at\nseven o\u2019clock.\u201d\nRudge laughed.",
    "\u201cI haven\u2019t a doubt it\u2019s simple enough to you\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cPersonally I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea what you\u2019re talking about.",
    "What on earth\ndo you mean by high water Full and Change\u201d\n\u201cWhy merely that it\u2019s high water at Whynmouth at seven o\u2019clock nearabouts\non the days when the moon is full or new\u201d replied Ware.",
    "\u201cNow take this\nmorning\u2019s tide for instance.",
    "Today\u2019s Wednesday the 10th.",
    "It was new moon on\nMonday that\u2019s to say it was high water at Whynmouth at seven on Monday\nevening.",
    "It would be about eight yesterday evening and halfpast this morning.",
    "You can allow six hours between high and low water making it low water at\nhalfpast two this morning.",
    "The tide up here begins to flow half to threequarters\nof an hour after low water at Whynmouth or say soon after three.",
    "And that\u2019s\nwhen I went out fishing.\u201d\n\u201cAfter three\u201d exclaimed Rudge.",
    "\u201cBut I thought you said the church clock\nstruck four not long before you saw the boat\u201d\n\u201cThe clock\u201d replied Ware in a voice of supreme contempt.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t\nexpect the tide to fall in with the children\u2019s games you play with the clock in\nsummer do you You play a game of makebelieve with the time just because\nyou haven\u2019t the courage to face the prospects of getting up an hour earlier than\n\n\fusual.",
    "It may be all very well for landsmen but it won\u2019t do for sailors.",
    "To them\ntime\u2019s time and you can\u2019t alter it.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "Then by summertime the tide began to flow this morning up here\nsoon after four.",
    "From what you tell me then I gather that it began to ebb about\nten last night\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right ten or a little before\u201d agreed Ware.",
    "\u201cAs I say the moon was\nnew two days ago which means that it was pretty well the top of the springs last\nnight.",
    "I reckon the ebb must have run down the river nigh on three knots for the\nfirst couple of hours or so.",
    "After that it would have slacked off a bit as it always\ndoes.\u201d\n\u201cSo that a man leaving here between ten and eleven would have had no\ndifficulty in getting to Whynmouth by boat\u201d suggested Inspector Rudge.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019d have drifted there and likely enough gone straight out to sea\u201d replied\nWare.",
    "\u201cThat is if he didn\u2019t use his oars.",
    "If he did he could have got to\nWhynmouth in under the hour easy.\u201d\nThe old sailor had glanced shrewdly at the Inspector as he spoke.",
    "Rudge saw\nwhat was in his mind and smiled.",
    "\u201cYou can guess what I\u2019m getting at\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI thought it possible that Admiral Penistone might have taken his boat down to\nWhynmouth last night.",
    "But if he did the boat cannot have come back by itself.",
    "Somebody must have rowed it back and put it into the boathouse.\u201d\nHe paused half expecting some comment from Ware but the old man merely\nnodded and continued puffing at his pipe in silence.",
    "Rudge tried a new tack.",
    "\u201cWhy was the painter of the Vicar\u2019s boat cut and not untied Ware\u201d he asked\nabruptly.",
    "Ware smiled.",
    "\u201cBecause it couldn\u2019t have been anything else as the Vicar\u2019s\nboys could tell you if you asked them\u201d he replied.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s no business of mine\nthis murder but naturally my mind\u2019s been on it all the morning.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d very much like to hear the conclusions you\u2019ve come to\u201d said Inspector\nRudge quietly.",
    "\u201cWhy do you say that the painter of the Vicar\u2019s boat couldn\u2019t\nhave been untied for instance\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t come to any conclusions\u201d replied Ware impassively.",
    "\u201cThat is I\ndon\u2019t know who killed the Admiral if that\u2019s what you mean.",
    "But it isn\u2019t difficult\nto understand how the boats came to be found as they were.\u201d\n\u201cNot for you perhaps\u201d remarked the Inspector \u201cbut it would be a great help\nto me if you\u2019d explain.\u201d\n\u201cAye that I will.",
    "Now take the Vicar\u2019s boat first.",
    "She\u2019s not kept in the boathouse while the boys are at home but out in the stream tied to a post.",
    "Sometimes the lads remember to take the oars and crutches out of her when they\ncome ashore mostly they don\u2019t.",
    "I\u2019ve seen them left in her dozens of times.",
    "\u201cNow suppose they\u2019d been out in her yesterday evening and tied her up\nwhen the tide was high or well up as it would have been any time between\nseven and ten.",
    "You\u2019ll find in any tidal river that the greater part of the rise\nhappens during the first three hours of the flood and the greater part of the fall\nduring the first three hours of the ebb.",
    "Right.",
    "They come in when the tide\u2019s well\nup and what do they do One of them stands up in the bow and makes the\npainter fast to the post.",
    "They\u2019re both wellgrown lads and they\u2019d naturally make\nfast about four or five feet above the water.",
    "Then they\u2019d pole the stern round till\nit touched the bank and they could jump ashore.",
    "Maybe they were afraid of\nbeing late for dinner and forgot the oars and crutches in their hurry.\u201d\nInspector Rudge nodded.",
    "This did not seem to take him any further than he\nhad got already.",
    "\u201cNow take the Admiral\u2019s boat\u201d continued Ware.",
    "\u201cFrom what I hear she was\nseen either in or alongside the Rundel Croft boathouse soon after ten.",
    "Now this\nI\u2019m pretty sure of.",
    "If anybody took her out between ten and one this morning\nthey didn\u2019t row far up the river.",
    "You don\u2019t make much headway with a heavy\nboat like that against a threeknot tide.",
    "You take it from me if she went out at\nall she went downstream and not up.",
    "\u201cAfter one this morning\u2014I\u2019m talking in shore time now not real time\u2014things\nwould be different.",
    "There\u2019d be only a gentle stream running down till four\nperhaps a knot at the most.",
    "Anyone could row against that it wouldn\u2019t take them\nmore than a couple of hours to come up from Whynmouth say taking it easy.",
    "That\u2019s clear enough isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly clear\u201d replied Rudge.",
    "\u201cIt comes to this.",
    "If the Admiral was\nmurdered in his own boat it must have been somewhere below Rundel Croft\nanywhere as far down as Whynmouth in fact\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.",
    "Now I suppose whoever murdered him brought the boat back\nwith the body in it.",
    "Suppose they got back round about slack water.",
    "The chap\nwhoever he was sees the Vicar\u2019s boat moored to the post in the stream and hits\nupon the idea of putting the body in it.",
    "He goes alongside lifts the body in and\nthen what does he do next How is he going to cast off the Vicar\u2019s boat Tell me\nthat\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t exactly see the difficulty\u201d replied the Inspector.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t made fast\nwith a chain and padlock.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see what I was getting at just now\u201d said Ware with a touch of\nimpatience.",
    "\u201cWhy when he got back it was dead low water and the river had\nfallen three or four feet since the boat had been made fast.",
    "Don\u2019t you see Unless\nhe was a very tall man he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the knot unless he swarmed\nup the post.",
    "There was only one thing for him to do and that was to cut the\n\n\fpainter.",
    "And there\u2019s one thing about that you may not have noticed.",
    "That painter\nis a nearly new piece of inchandahalf manilla.\u201d\n\u201cI noticed that it looked fairly new.",
    "But I can\u2019t see for the moment what that\u2019s\ngot to do with it.\u201d\n\u201cEver tried to cut new manilla with an ordinary pocket knife No I suppose\nnot.",
    "But you can take it from me that you\u2019d find it a pretty tough job.",
    "And when\nyou\u2019d finished you\u2019d have left a frayed edge.",
    "But this rope was cut clean\nthrough like as though it had been cut with one stroke of a very sharp knife.",
    "Anyway cut it was and the boat left to drift.\u201d\nWare tapped out his pipe and began slowly to refill it.",
    "He drew from his\npocket the end of a cake of tobacco which he shaved carefully into the palm of\nhis hand.",
    "\u201cThis knife is pretty sharp\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cI keep it so on purpose to\ncut up my baccy.",
    "But I wouldn\u2019t reckon to cut through that painter with it at one\nstroke.",
    "No it was a sharper and stronger knife than this that did the job I\u2019ll be\nbound.\u201d\nWhile he proceeded to fill and light his pipe Inspector Rudge\u2019s thoughts were\nbusy.",
    "The possibility that Admiral Penistone had taken his boat out again and\nrowed down the river seemed to be greatly strengthened.",
    "In that case he had\nprobably been murdered somewhere near Whynmouth and his body had reached\nthe spot where it was found much as Ware had supposed.",
    "But was there any way\nof verifying this\nIn the first place what time had he started The doctor had given it as his\nopinion that he had been killed before midnight.",
    "Again if he had indeed been the\nvisitor to the Lord Marshall he had reached Whynmouth soon after eleven.",
    "His\ndeparture from Rundel Croft could not have been very long deferred his\nimpatience to leave the Vicarage seemed to point to a desire to start as soon as\npossible.",
    "His excuse to his niece for not going up to the house with her that he\nwished to smoke a cigar before going in was probably mainly to get her out of\nthe way.",
    "He had probably intended to start as soon as she was out of sight and\nhearing.",
    "But if he had done so how was it that the Vicar who was in the summerhouse till twenty minutes past ten had not seen him Suddenly Rudge\nremembered the Vicar\u2019s evident confusion when he had heard of the murder.",
    "Was it possible that he had actually seen the Admiral\u2019s departure on this\nmysterious journey and had his own very good reasons for not disclosing the\nfact It was at least possible.",
    "The Inspector\u2019s reflections were interrupted by a remark from Ware who had\nat last succeeded in getting his pipe to draw satisfactorily.",
    "\u201cQueer thing that I\ndon\u2019t seem to recognise Admiral Penistone\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThere was only one of\n\n\fthat name in the Navy List when I was serving and I saw him more than once.\u201d\n\u201cDid you When was that\u201d asked Rudge eagerly.",
    "\u201cWhy on the China Station twenty years ago and more.",
    "I was in the\nRutlandshire then one of the threefunnelled County class cruisers she was and\nthe very devil to roll in a seaway.",
    "I remember once being caught in the edge of a\ntyphoon and she pretty nigh carried everything away alow and aloft.",
    "That\u2019s her\nover there.\u201d\nHe pointed with the stem of his pipe to one of the photographs that adorned\nthe room.",
    "\u201cHer sister ship was on the same station with us.",
    "Huntingdonshire she\nwas called and you couldn\u2019t tell t\u2019other from which except by the bands on\ntheir funnels.",
    "Our sixinch guns for\u2019ard was a bit higher above the deck that was\nall.",
    "Huntingdonshire\u2019s skipper was a man called Penistone and a better officer\nyou couldn\u2019t meet.",
    "The Huntingdonshires swore by him.",
    "She was always a\nhappy ship all on board properly looked after.",
    "And smart too.",
    "Captain Penistone\nhad been a gunnery expert before he was promoted and he kept it up on his own\nship.",
    "When he commanded her Huntingdonshire had the best gunnery record in\nthe Navy.\u201d\n\u201cWas this the same man whose body you saw in the Vicar\u2019s boat this\nmorning\u201d asked Rudge.",
    "\u201cWell if it was he\u2019s changed a lot since I knew him.",
    "Not that the body I saw\nwasn\u2019t about the same height and all that.",
    "But if it was the same face it has\nchanged a lot in the last twenty years.",
    "It was the expression I go by mostly.",
    "The\nCaptain Penistone I knew was a jovial sort of chap with a cheery word for\neverybody no matter whether he was just a stoker or the Admiral himself.",
    "And\nthe chap I saw this morning looked with all due respect to him an illtempered\nsort of devil.\u201d\n\u201cI fancy he was from what I\u2019ve heard of him\u201d replied Rudge.",
    "\u201cWell Ware\nI\u2019m much obliged to you for what you\u2019ve told me.",
    "By the way you\u2019ll have to\ngive evidence at the inquest you know.",
    "You\u2019ll get a summons to attend in due\ncourse.",
    "And I\u2019ll drop in for another yarn sometime if I may\u201d\n\u201cAye you\u2019re always welcome\u201d said Ware cordially.",
    "\u201cAnd if you\u2019re a\nfisherman I\u2019ll take you to a spot where there\u2019s some fine sport to be had.",
    "It\u2019s\nprivate by rights like all the fishing here but no one minds about me.\u201d\nInspector Rudge left the old man\u2019s cottage and started up his car.",
    "It was time\nto pay his deferred visit to Sir Wilfrid Denny.",
    "As he drove towards West End\nhis thoughts were busy with the problem of how to discover whether or not\nAdmiral Penistone had rowed downstream the previous night.",
    "If he had he was\nnot likely to have been observed.",
    "The river ran out of sight of the road for the\ngreater part of its course.",
    "Only at one point Fernton Bridge was it visible.",
    "There\n\n\fwere certainly a few cottages close to its banks but their inhabitants were pretty\ncertain to have been in bed by ten o\u2019clock.",
    "There was therefore only the faint\npossibility that someone had crossed Fernton Bridge at the moment that the\nAdmiral had passed beneath it.",
    "The fact that his journey was not likely to have been observed had another\nbearing on the matter.",
    "His murderer must either have known of his intention or\nmust have seen him by chance either at Fernton Bridge or in Whynmouth.",
    "But if\nhe had met him by chance how did he happen to be provided with a suitable\nweapon People didn\u2019t as a rule carry about with them daggers capable of\ninflicting such a wound.",
    "No the casual meeting did not seem to fit in somehow.",
    "The crime must have been premeditated.",
    "But until he could learn more of the\nAdmiral\u2019s associates it was impossible to guess who could have known of his\nplans.",
    "There was always the likelihood of course that the murderer had\narranged the rendezvous.",
    "As he crossed Fernton Bridge Rudge stopped the car and looked over the\nparapet on either side.",
    "He found that he could see a few hundred yards both upand downstream before bends hid the river in either direction.",
    "On a clear night\na boat would show up against the water for some distance.",
    "Having satisfied\nhimself of this he continued his journey.",
    "West End was a suburb of Whynmouth on the harbour side of the river and\nconsisted mainly of redbrick villas each standing in its square of garden.",
    "But\none older stonebuilt house remained hidden from its neighbours and the railway\nto the north by a high shrubbery.",
    "This as Rudge had ascertained was called\nMardale and was the residence of Sir Wilfrid Denny.",
    "The drive gate was open\nand he drove in to be struck at once by the neglected and overgrown appearance\nof the lawn that sloped down to the river and the state of dilapidation into which\nthe house had been allowed to fall.",
    "He remembered Mrs. Davis\u2019s hint as to Sir\nWilfrid\u2019s lack of means which had apparently been fully justified.",
    "There seemed to be nobody about as he rang the bell but after a long wait an\nelderly and rather forbiddinglooking dame appeared and looked enquiringly at\nhim.",
    "\u201cIs Sir Wilfrid Denny at home\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cNo he ain\u2019t\u201d replied the woman.",
    "\u201c \u2019E was called to London hunexpectedly\nand left by the first train this morning.\u201d\n\n\fCHAPTER VI\nBy Milward Kennedy\nINSPECTOR RUDGE THINKS BETTER OF IT\nquestion or two elicited the facts that the \u201ccall\u201d had been a telephonic\none and that it was not Sir Wilfrid\u2019s habit to go often or regularly or above all\nearly to London.",
    "He was not it seemed a city magnate but a retired civil\nservant\u2014\u201cone of those conciliar officers\u201d the woman explained.",
    "The Inspector\nbegan to understand the untidiness of the drive for whilst your Business Man\nusually acquires his knighthood at the height of his prosperity and retires to\naffluence your civil servant finds that a title is small compensation for the\ndifference between salary and pension.",
    "The news of Sir Wilfrid\u2019s absence was disconcerting but on the whole and\nafter a couple of seconds of quick thinking not altogether unwelcome.",
    "Inspector\nRudge was subconsciously aware that his enquiries were becoming unduly\ndispersed and that none of them by itself had so far earned the description of\n\u201cthorough.\u201d As he thanked the woman gave her a polite message for Sir Wilfrid\nasking him to get in touch with the police on his return started up the car and\ndrove back towards Lingham his subconscious feelings took definite shape in\nhis conscience so definite that just before he reached the fork of the road he\npulled in close to the hedge stopped the car lit his pipe took out his notebook\nand meditated.",
    "He had been dashing about to and fro\u2014from the Vicarage to Rundel Croft\nfrom Rundel Croft to Whynmouth from the Lord Marshall Hotel to Ware\u2019s\ncottage from the cottage back to West End and now he was going\u2014well where\nwas he going now Of course he had wasted very little time for the distances\nwere all of them small incidentally he wondered whether a little while ago he\nhad been quite safe to assume that the Admiral could hardly have reached the\nLord Marshall on foot by eleven o\u2019clock for now that he came to consider it the\ndistance from Rundel Croft could not be much over two and a half miles at the\noutside.",
    "However that was by the way what the Inspector wanted at the\nmoment was to plan out his campaign.",
    "What had he learnt in the first place at Rundel Croft By Jove he had\nforgotten all about that newspaper.",
    "If Emery had discovered the \u201cregular\u201d copy\nstill in the hall might not the explanation of the copy in the dead man\u2019s pocket\nA TACTFUL\n\n\fbe that he had indeed gone into Whynmouth Well it was idle to speculate\nthere obviously was one loose thread to be picked up.",
    "For the rest his enquiries\nhad been directed to two distinct purposes\u2014to find out something about the\npeople involved their history and characteristics and so on and on the other\nhand to discover what had happened after the dinner at the Vicarage on the\nprevious evening.",
    "The more he considered it the more annoyed he felt at Miss\nFitzgerald\u2019s flight\u2014he hoped to goodness that was too strong a word and he\nwondered doubtfully whether he had not been a bit too generous in the liberty\nhe had allowed to Holland.",
    "Still neither of them perhaps\u2014unless his\nimpressions were all wrong\u2014was the best source for information about the\nAdmiral.",
    "But what else had he to go upon Practically nothing but the gossip of\nthe Vicarage the servants old Ware and Mrs. Davis none of whom could boast\nmore than a month\u2019s acquaintance with the dead man.",
    "The Vicar had suggested\nthat the Admiral usually was genial enough his sons had implied rather the\nopposite.",
    "And old Ware\u2014well what reliance could be placed on his opinion A\npetty officer could hardly have been intimate with the captain of a cruiser and\nbesides twenty years was long enough to dim the vividness of his recollection.",
    "Of course Sir Wilfrid Denny might have been able to help but it was rather a\nleap in the dark.",
    "He might have known the Admiral no longer than had the\nVicar and if he had seen more of him in the past month it might simply be that\nthe exgunnery expert had no particular penchant for clergymen that would not\nbe an unprecedented trait in a retired Admiral.",
    "No Rudge told himself he must clearly get to work on less haphazard lines\nthere would be records at the Admiralty there were the solicitors there would be\n\u201creferences\u201d given to the houseagents when the lease of Rundel Croft was\nsigned.",
    "And the thought of the solicitors reminded him of the will.",
    "He had not\nfinished his study of it its provisions might be of firstrate importance as a\nguide to motive.",
    "He did not even know whether it was a copy of a proved will\nthough that obviously would make a vital difference.",
    "There seemed to be plenty of enquiries to set on foot and the first essentials\nseemed to be a telephone and a staff it was not much use leaving both the\nsergeant and the constable to spend their day at the boathouse while he himself\ntried to be everywhere at once and to do three jobs at the same time.",
    "Still he\nwould not be in too much of a hurry he was enjoying his pipe and he wanted to\nlook all round the problem.",
    "What about last night\u2019s events By Jove there was a\npoint which he seemed to have missed.",
    "Where was the key of the french\nwindow Was the Admiral the only one who had a private key or did his niece\npossess one also\nRudge puffed away at his pipe and flicked over the pages of his notebook.",
    "The\n\n\fmaid\u2014yes Jennie Merton nice little thing and quite intelligent.",
    "She had given\nhim a pretty clear picture of Elma Fitzgerald and her uncle and the household as\na whole.",
    "Had she though Had he not been a shade too ready to take her opinion\nas reliable She had been there just three weeks and yet when she had told him\nthat Elma and the Admiral were \u201csharp\u201d with one another and that Elma and\nHolland did not \u201chold hands\u201d much and that she could not understand the whys\nand wherefores of Elma\u2019s variability in getting herself up and putting on her best\nclothes\u2014well had not he been a bit too ready to think that there was something\nmysterious almost sinister in all of this More likely the other maid the one\nwho had been so bored that she had left after a week of Rundel Croft could have\ntold him the inner history of the Admiral\u2019s household perhaps they were used to\na gayer life.",
    "\u2026 Anyhow she must have been pretty thoroughly bored if she had\nchucked her wages in order to get away.",
    "He pulled himself up sharply here he\nwas on the brink of labelling the vanished maid as a foreign adventuress\u2014and\nall on the strength of a few words of Jennie Merton\u2019s.",
    "And when he came to think about it there was something well a little\nconfusing about Jennie\u2019s account of the morning and the disappearance of that\nwhite evening dress.",
    "Emery apparently had found Jennie and Jennie had gone\nto wake up her mistress and to tell her she was wanted the whole process taking\nno less than ten minutes.",
    "Then Jennie was told to clear out at once as her\nmistress wished to get up.",
    "But at some stage she was told to pack a few things\nfor the night.",
    "And when she started on the packing\u2014and that presumably was\nwhile her mistress was being interviewed downstairs\u2014the white frock had\nvanished and was nowhere to be found.",
    "Yet Jennie blandly assumed that the\nfrock was afterwards packed in the bag by her mistress as if that explained\neverything.",
    "It certainly seemed to suggest that her wits were not so wonderfully\nsharp after all.",
    "And what was more he would have another word or two with her\non the subject.",
    "There was certainly a good job of work to be done at Rundel Croft.",
    "That was\nnot to say there was nothing to do at the Vicarage.",
    "If the two boys had found no\ntrace of the weapon a proper search might need to be organised.",
    "And then the\nVicar\u2019s hat on the one hand he had been so quick to remember where he had\nabsentmindedly left it which seemed a bit inconsistent and on the other he had\nshown no perturbation when the subject was mentioned\u2014at any rate infinitely\nless than at other points in the interview.",
    "Inspector Rudge knocked out his pipe and started up the car.",
    "He was for\nRundel Croft and as he turned into the drive he found yet another reason for his\ndecision\u2014the traces in the boat and boathouse.",
    "He left the car in front of the\nhouse and hurried round and down in search of his two subordinates.",
    "They\n\n\fgreeted him in a manner which suggested that they were bursting with news.",
    "\u201cWell Sergeant\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cAnything important Found the weapon\u201d\n\u201cNo sir but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat then The footprints\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2014no sir.\u201d\n\u201cH\u2019m.",
    "Well we\u2019ll hear about it in a minute.\u201d\nThen he realised that he was being rather needlessly abrupt and that Sergeant\nAppleton in particular was now wearing a distinctly sullen expression.",
    "\u201cSorry\u201d he said with a pleasant smile.",
    "\u201cThe point is that we\u2019ve a lot to get\nthrough and I want to get started at once on the jobs that are going to take the\nmost time.",
    "Just set the wheels moving you know.",
    "So if you haven\u2019t actually\ncaught the murderer or as good as done so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot quite that sir\u201d the sergeant answered his good humour restored.",
    "\u201cThen you Sergeant come up to the house with me.",

    "We\u2019ll be down again as soon as we can.",
    "Keep an eye on the opposite\nbank too.\u201d\nThe two men hurried back to the house and the Inspector led the way straight\nto the french window which was foremost in his thoughts one thing was certain\nthe key was not on the outside.",
    "They hurried round to the front door and rang the\nbell after an interval of at least three minutes during which the Inspector fumed\nimpatiently Emery opened it and admitted them with the same air of\nincompetent reluctance which had been the Inspector\u2019s first impression of him.",
    "\u201cI want another word with you Emery\u201d he began sternly.",
    "\u201cHere it is\u201d said Emery.",
    "\u201cHere what is\u201d The man really seemed to be halfwitted as well as painfully\nslow.",

    "If it was lying there all the time\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo more I was\u201d Emery asserted in weak indignation \u201cand the minute I\nwent to see and my back was turned you skipped off.\u201d\nThe Inspector snorted he was unable to deny that the man had some reason on\nhis side but people who were as slow as the butler must expect all kinds of\ncriticism.",
    "\u201cHad it been read\u201d was his next question.",
    "He saw at once that it was not\ncalculated to produce a helpful answer so he hastily amended it and extracted\nfrom Emery the opinion that the paper had not been touched since first it had\n\n\fbeen laid by him on the table.",
    "The Inspector nodded then picked up the paper and requested the butler to\nlead the way to the study.",
    "The sergeant was distinctly puzzled particularly at the\nappropriation of the Evening Gazette but followed in silence and closed the\nstudy door behind the little procession.",
    "\u201cNow Emery\u201d the Inspector resumed with difficulty restraining a tendency\nto shout \u201cI want to know about the keys of the french window\u2014the one you\nshut but did not bolt.",
    "First of all were all the other doors locked and bolted when\nyou went to bed last night They were eh So that this was the only way by\nwhich the Admiral and Miss Fitzgerald could get in.",
    "I see.",
    "And now this window\n\u2014how many keys are there\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my key here on my ring\u201d the butler replied and quite briskly\nproduced a fat bunch selected the key and proffered it for inspection.",
    "The other\ntook it satisfied himself that it was the right key by unlocking the window and\nhanded back the bunch.",
    "He had wondered how the butler managed to remember\nnot to leave the key in the lock inside the bunch explained it.",
    "\u201cRight\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHow many others are there\u201d\n\u201cOnly the one that I know of.",
    "The one the Admiral had himself.\u201d\n\u201cSure of that\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only one I ever heard of.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Fitzgerald hasn\u2019t got one\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know\u201d\n\u201cWell once or twice of an evening she\u2019s borrowed the key from the Admiral.\u201d\n\u201cOh does she often go out in the evening\u201d The Inspector could not resist this\ndeviation from the main channel of his questions.",
    "\u201cNow and again.",
    "With Mr. Holland\u201d the butler told him with an approach to\na smirk.",
    "\u201cWalking out eh\u201d Rudge suggested vulgarly and the smirk became an\naccomplished fact.",
    "Rudge made a mental comparison of this with Jennie\nMerton\u2019s opinion then as if determined to keep Emery in his place he asked\nsharply \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the second key\u2014the Admiral\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2014I really couldn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did the Admiral keep it On a ring with other keys like you do or\nseparately\u201d\n\u201cBy itself\u201d Emery told him.",
    "\u201cIt used to lie on his table in the pen tray.",
    "It had a\nlabel.\u201d\nThe Inspector strode sharply across the room.",
    "\u201cWell it\u2019s not there now\u201d he announced.",
    "Several bright ideas sprang into his\n\n\fmind.",
    "The Admiral must have given the key to his niece when she walked up to\nthe house ahead of him.",
    "She must either have come in and locked the door\nbehind her\u2014and so locked her uncle out in which case how did he get the\novercoat Or else she must have left the window open probably with the key in\nthe lock and her uncle must have come in locking the door and pocketing the\nkey\u2014but there had been no odd key in his pockets certainly none with a label.",
    "Sergeant Appleton coughed.",
    "\u201cMaybe this is it sir\u201d he said and held out a key to which was attached a\nsmall metal label with the word \u201cWindow\u201d engraved on it.",
    "He added in answer\nto the Inspector\u2019s rather angry questioning look \u201cWe were going to tell you sir\nby the boathouse.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all for the present\u201d the Inspector said to Emery.",
    "\u201cI may want you\nagain later so you\u2019ll keep handy see Is there another telephone Then this is an\nextension I suppose\u201d He pointed to one on a table at the far end of the study.",
    "\u201cJust switch it through to here.",
    "And another thing I shall want to see the maid\u2014\nMerton\u2014again in a few minutes.\u201d\n\u201cWell she\u2019s gone out\u201d the butler told him with perhaps a tinge of malicious\nsatisfaction.",
    "\u201cBut I told you didn\u2019t I\u2014\u201d the other began angrily.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s her mother.",
    "She\u2019s queer.\u201d\nThe Inspector snorted again and the butler hastily withdrew.",
    "It was useless to\nfind fault with the poor creature he could no more stop Jennie Merton going out\nthan Mr. Holland coming in as Rudge observed to the sergeant.",
    "\u201cNo harm done\u201d he added in reference to the key the sergeant rightly took\nthis to be a veiled apology.",
    "\u201cWhere did you find it\u201d\n\u201cIn the boat\u2014the Admiral\u2019s boat.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been messing about\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh no sir.",
    "Not that there\u2019s any danger.",
    "Apart from the oars and rowlocks\nshe\u2019s as neat as a new pin.\u201d\n\u201cH\u2019m.",
    "What about the key for fingerprints\u201d\nBut it was easy to see that the rough surface of the label would not \u201ctake\u201d a\nfingerprint.",
    "\u201cSomeone took trouble with the boat\u201d said Rudge thoughtfully \u201cso I wonder\nhow the key came to be left there.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the state of the boat means much\u2014necessarily\u201d the sergeant\nsuggested.",
    "\u201cI had a word with the Vicar\u2019s boys.",
    "They say that Admiral Penistone\nalways gave her a mop over like last thing after he\u2019d finished with her for the\nday.\u201d\nThe Inspector considered this.",
    "It seemed to fit in with the description of the\n\n\fAdmiral as a precise martinet and it might help to explain why after hustling\naway from the Vicarage\u2014directly after ten because he must be in by midnight\n\u2014he had dawdled behind at the boathouse.",
    "But it was far from conclusive.",
    "\u201cWell fire ahead\u201d he urged the sergeant.",
    "\u201cIt just caught my eye the edge of the label affair.",
    "Just sticking out from\nunder the bottom boards of the boat.",
    "As if it had been dropped and had slipped\ndown inside.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d better try it just to make sure.\u201d\nHe fitted it into the keyhole and locked and unlocked the window.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s it all right\u201d he agreed and stood silent for a few moments tapping the\nkey against the palm of his left hand and staring absentmindedly about the\nroom.",
    "Suddenly he emerged from his brown study and walked across to the\nmantelpiece.",
    "He took down a large framed photograph of a naval officer in fulldress uniform.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s him all right isn\u2019t it Admiral Penistone\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Sergeant Appleton in some surprise he was enlightened about the\nconversation with old Ware.",
    "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound likely to me that he\u2019s not the real Admiral Penistone\u201d was\nhis comment.",
    "\u201cIf he isn\u2019t he\u2019s pinched the whole outfit\u201d and he pointed to an\nengraved cup which also stood on the mantelpiece.",
    "A further scrutiny moreover\nrevealed a \u201cgroup\u201d of naval officers in the centre of which was a younger but\nunmistakably a likeness of the dead man.",
    "The names of the group were neatly\nprinted below the photograph and in the centre was the name of Captain\nPenistone.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s more than a shade of doubt\u201d the Inspector agreed.",
    "\u201cBut\nwe can\u2019t afford to take chances.",
    "That\u2019s one job I\u2019ve got for you\u2014to ring up the\nAdmiralty.\u201d\nAs he spoke he took down a copy of Who\u2019s Who from a shelf full of reference\nbooks.",
    "\u201cHere we are\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m.",
    "No address given I see\u2014just the outline of his\ncareer in the service.",
    "Gunnery yes.",
    "China Squadron.",
    "Seems to have been a bit of\na starturn.",
    "Funny that he should have retired so young\u2014I thought the axe was a\nmodern invention.",
    "Anyway you ring up the Admiralty.",
    "If he\u2019s the right man\nthey can probably tell you a bit more about him or suggest how we can find out.",
    "Go ahead Sergeant get on to the Admiralty.\u201d\nSergeant Appleton took off the receiver.",
    "The line was dead the lamentable\nEmery obviously had failed to switch the telephone through.",
    "The sergeant set off\nto remedy matters and took the opportunity to give the butler a piece of his\nmind.",
    "He returned to find the Inspector seated at the writingdesk deep in a fresh\nattempt to translate legal language into common sense.",
    "It was not really as\ndifficult as he had fancied on his previous and hurried inspection of the will.",
    "The estate of Admiral Penistone\u2019s brotherinlaw apparently was divided equally\napart from one or two small legacies between Elma Fitzgerald and her brother.",
    "Until her brother\u2019s death was established she and her uncle were trustees for his\nshare the interest upon which less a consideration to both of them was to be put\nto the capital on his death the money went absolutely to her.",
    "As for her share\nshe did not receive the principal until she married and until then her uncle and\nMr. Edwin Dakers of Dakers and Dakers were trustees.",
    "The only remarkable\nclause was a provision that if she married without the written approval of her\nuncle she retained only a life interest in her share the money on her death going\nto a series of charities.",
    "The Inspector was rather gratified to find that as he had\nsuspected there was no question of the Admiral having been her sole trustee his\nrecollection of the law was that such a situation was hardly possible.",
    "The\ndocument of course was a copy Dakers and Dakers probably would know if it\nwas a copy of a proved will and it might be necessary for formal purposes to\ninspect the original at Somerset House.",
    "The sergeant could talk to Mr. Edwin\nDakers.",
    "\u2026\nBut the sergeant did not seem to be getting on with his telephoning the fact of\nthe matter being that he was far from certain how exactly one \u201crang up the\nAdmiralty\u201d and for whom one asked when one was in touch with that august\ndepartment.",
    "The local exchange had not been particularly bright either but was\nsupposed to be making enquiries.",
    "The Inspector frowned and glanced restlessly\nat the Evening Gazette which he had thrown down on the desk.",
    "He must have a\ncareful look through the copy in the dead man\u2019s pocket.",
    "The way it was folded\nmight be suggestive or there might be a marked paragraph.",
    "The Admiral would\nsurely not have bought an extra one knowing that his own would be lying in the\nhall unless there had been something of special importance in it.",
    "The \u201cnews\u201d did\nnot look anything out of the usual a \u201cLondon Flat Tragedy\u201d occupied most of\nthe front page together with an account of fresh trouble in Manchuria Moscow\nas usual was said to be giving liberal help to the latest unpronounceable War\nLord and a picture of the bridesmaids at a wedding at St. Margaret\u2019s.",
    "The telephone bell rang.",
    "The sergeant still apprehensive took up the receiver.",
    "His expression changed rapidly to one of surprise.",
    "\u201cWho Yes.",
    "Hold on and I\u2019ll fetch\u2014oh very well.",
    "Who Oh yes yes just\nwait\u2014\u201d he beckoned frantically to the Inspector who came quickly across the\nroom.",
    "\u201cWho is it\u201d\n\n\f\u201cMiss\u2014yes\u2014I\u2019m listening\u2014Miss Fitzgerald.\u201d\n\u201cGive it to me\u201d the Inspector demanded.",
    "\u201cCome on man.\u201d The sergeant was\nscribbling illegible notes on the pad before him.",
    "At length and rather doubtfully\nhe handed over the instrument.",
    "\u201cMiss Fitzgerald This is Inspector Rudge.",
    "I\u2019m\nglad you\u2019ve rung up.",
    "I want to ask you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSorry\u201d he heard in Elma Fitzgerald\u2019s flattest tones \u201cI can\u2019t wait now.",
    "I\u2019ve\nsent you a message.",
    "And by the way I\u2019m not Miss Fitzgerald.\u201d\nThere was a click as she rang off.",
    "The Inspector swore and joggled the lever\nfuriously up and down.",
    "\u201cTrace that call please\u201d he demanded of the exchange and explained who he\nwas.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all right sir\u201d said the sergeant.",
    "\u201cShe was speaking from the Carlton in\nLondon.",
    "She said so herself and besides I heard the hotel exchange say so when\nthe call came through.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the message Wouldn\u2019t wait to speak to me eh\u201d\n\u201cShe said she understood you wanted to get in touch with her and with Mr.\nHolland.",
    "So you\u2019d be interested to know that they were both staying at the\nCarlton and would be there for the next day or two and then they would come\nback.",
    "She\u2019d be out dancing tonight but would always be glad to see you by\nappointment.",
    "But would you remember to ask for Mrs. Holland as she was\nmarried by special license today.\u201d\nThe Inspector digested\u2014or began to digest\u2014this news in silence.",
    "If Elma and\nHolland were man and wife it made it difficult to \u2026 And then the will.",
    "If the\nAdmiral was dead the clause about his consent to his niece\u2019s marriage\npresumably fell to the ground \u2026 Elma\u2019s message certainly gave him something\nto think about.",
    "\u201cWell Sergeant\u201d he decided \u201cwe\u2019d better get on with it.",
    "Hurry up that call to\nthe Admiralty and after that I want you to get hold of Mr. Edwin Dakers\u201d and\nhe rapidly fired off a series of instructions including one that he was to be told\nwhen Jennie Merton came back.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going down to the boathouse\u201d he ended\nand departed via the french window.",
    "He found Hempstead patiently on guard.",
    "\u201cAny news\u201d he asked him.",
    "\u201cNo sir.",
    "No one been here.\u201d\n\u201cNo fresh discoveries\u201d\n\u201cNo sir.",
    "The sergeant told you about the key\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Good work.",
    "Anything happened opposite\u201d\n\u201cNo sir.",
    "The young gentlemen have been looking everywhere for the knife\nbut I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve found anything.",
    "They said they were going to have a\n\n\fbathe now.\u201d\nThe sun was getting hot and there was a note of envy in the constable\u2019s tones.",
    "\u201cSeen the Vicar\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "He\u2019s been watering the garden.\u201d\n\u201cWhat this morning In the sun\u201d\n\u201cYes sir with a hose.",
    "Worth watching it was.",
    "He watered pretty well\neverything in sight\u2014even the flowers now and again.",
    "But I shouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s\ndone them much harm.",
    "I reckon he doesn\u2019t know an awful lot about gardening\nand that\u2019s just what Bob Hawkins who goes in twice a week says.\u201d\nThe Inspector surveyed the boathouse and its contents.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll make casts of those footprints if we can\u201d he said \u201cthough they don\u2019t\nlook very distinctive.",
    "And I think we\u2019ll take out the oars and rowlocks.",
    "We can\u2019t\nkeep this place under observation for ever and if there are any fingerprints\nthat\u2019ll tell us anything we don\u2019t want them mucked up.\u201d\nHe stepped into the boat and began cautiously to hand out the articles in\nquestion to Hempstead.",
    "Whilst he was so doing the sound of voices on the\nopposite bank made him turn rocking the boat rather perilously.",
    "The two boys\nclad in bathing dresses with towels in their hands were coming down the rough\nredbrick path from the summerhouse.",
    "A sudden thought struck the Inspector.",
    "\u201cHullo\u201d he called as they reached the Vicarage landingsteps.",
    "\u201cI wonder\nwhether you\u2019d let me have the loan of your old punt for a while It would save\nme going round by road every time.\u201d\n\u201cRather\u201d the elder of the two answered.",
    "\u201cIf you could bring her across and swim back\u201d Rudge suggested.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the idea\u201d the boy answered with a grin.",
    "By the time the paraphernalia from the boat had been landed safely the punt\nhad arrived the Inspector moored it to a ring in the Rundel Croft landingstage.",
    "\u201cHow many times a day do you bathe\u201d he asked pleasantly.",
    "\u201cOr has the\nsearch made you so hot\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the search\u201d the younger replied perhaps detecting a note of\ncriticism in the question.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re going to try diving for the weapon\u201d the other added.",
    "\u201cGood\u201d said Rudge \u201cthough I\u2019m afraid that what with the mud and the tide\nand not knowing quite how big the weapon is likely to be it won\u2019t be easy.",
    "I\u2019d\nhoped you\u2019d find it on the bank somewhere but it seems you\u2019ve drawn a blank.\u201d\n\u201cAll we\u2019ve found is the Admiral\u2019s favourite pipe\u201d said Peter.",
    "\u201cIndeed And where did you find that\u201d\n\u201cIn father\u2019s study.",
    "He must have left it behind last night.",
    "He was smoking it\nafter dinner.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cSure it\u2019s his\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "You\u2019ll see why when you see it.",
    "A dirty old meerschaum shaped\nlike a nigger\u2019s head.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got it here then\u201d As he asked he realised that the question was\na foolish one.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s up at the house.\u201d Alec nobly refrained from a sarcastic comment and\nstepped to the end of the punt preparatory to diving into the river.",
    "\u201cI say Alec don\u2019t you think we ought to tell him\u2014\u201d his brother checked\nhim.",
    "\u201cTell him what Oh that.",
    "You are a fool Peter.",
    "No it\u2019s got nothing to do with\nit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u201d the Inspector enquired.",
    "\u201cOh nothing\u201d was the airy answer.",
    "\u201cSomething we lost not something we\nfound.\u201d\n\u201cBetter tell me then\u201d Rudge suggested.",
    "\u201cPolice job to find things you\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cThen you can do the diving instead of us\u201d Alec suggested brightly.",
    "\u201cStill as\nPeter\u2019s said so much I\u2019d better tell you.",
    "But it\u2019s got nothing to do with your\nbusiness.",
    "At least I don\u2019t see why it should have.",
    "It\u2019s just that we\u2014or at least\nPeter\u2014left a knife in the summerhouse yesterday afternoon or he says he did\nand it\u2019s not there now.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so\u201d Hempstead too pricked up his ears.",
    "\u201cWhat sort of a knife A\npocketknife I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWell no.",
    "It was a largesized Norwegian knife.",
    "We\u2019d used it to point a stake\n\u2014you want a sharp knife for that.",
    "Anyway it\u2019s lost and the chances are that\nPeter never left it in the summerhouse at all.",
    "He\u2019s as bad as father for not\nknowing where he\u2019s put things.\u201d\nAnd he plunged into the river promptly followed by Peter the Inspector\ngetting somewhat splashed in consequence.",
    "But he was content to get this fresh\nnews at the cost of a few drops of water and with a smile on his face he watched\nthe two lads swim across scramble out on to the far bank and begin to dive\nvalorously in search of the unknown weapon.",
    "The smile slowly faded evidence\u2014or call it information\u2014seemed to be\npiling up.",
    "He thought of the proverb about the difficulty of seeing the wood for\nthe trees.",
    "\u201cInteresting sir wasn\u2019t it\u201d Hempstead\u2019s voice broke in on his thoughts.",
    "\u201cThings begin to take shape as you might say.\u201d\nThe latter phrase was as much a question as the former.",
    "\u201cMaybe\u201d the Inspector answered him slowly \u201cbut there are plenty of puzzles\n\n\fyet.",
    "One thing Hempstead is that overcoat.",
    "Suppose the Admiral went out in his\nboat well I grant you he might take an overcoat with him but it would need to\nbe a very cold night before you or I\u2019d put on a thick overcoat to row in.",
    "Other\nthings apart you want your arms free don\u2019t you\u201d\nThe constable produced a throaty noise meant to convey assent without\ndefinitely committing him to it.",
    "\u201cAnd another thing\u201d Rudge went on \u201cis that evening paper.",
    "Oh lots of\npuzzles there are about that as well as the crossword.",
    "But the biggest is \u2018where\ndid he get it\u2019 It must have come by the eightthirty last night\u2014there\u2019s no\ngetting away from that.\u201d\nThere was a pause and then he added slowly and almost breathlessly \u201cUnless\nit came down by road.\u201d\nAnd then he turned to Hempstead just sharply enough to catch him\nsmothering a yawn.",
    "He remembered that the unfortunate constable had been on\nnight duty.",
    "That in turn suggested two things to him\u2014first that he must get the\noars and rowlocks up to the station and that Hempstead could see to that and\nhave himself \u201crelieved\u201d at the same time and secondly\u2014\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice anything particular in the way of cars in the\nneighbourhood round about halfpast ten say last night did you Hempstead\u201d\nThe constable considered the point.",
    "\u201cWell now you come to mention it sir\u201d he said at length \u201cthere was a car\nstopped in Lingham just about a quarter to eleven or thereabouts.",
    "I noticed it\nstop by the lamp in the Square.",
    "Closed car it was with a woman in it.\u201d\n\u201cAlone\u201d\n\u201cThat I couldn\u2019t say.",
    "I only know there was a woman because I saw her lean\nout of the window and speak to the chauffeur or whoever was driving.\u201d\n\u201cWould you know her again\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I should sir.",
    "And I didn\u2019t notice the number of the car much either\n\u2014you see there was no occasion then.",
    "I just happened to notice the car.",
    "It didn\u2019t\nstop above a couple of minutes and then drove on.",
    "Along the Whynmouth road.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that of course\u201d said Inspector Rudge \u201cwould take it past the\nVicarage.\u201d\n\n\fCHAPTER VII\nBy Dorothy L. Sayers\nSHOCKS FOR THE INSPECTOR\nInspector ruminated for a few moments upon the fascinating possibilities\nsuggested by this piece of information and then dismissing Hempstead with the\nadvice to get a good meal and turn in he walked slowly back towards the house.",
    "\u201cYes sonny what is it\u201d\nThis was to Peter Mount who had suddenly appeared at his elbow.",
    "\u201cA note for you from father\u201d said the boy.",
    "\u201cI came across with it.\u201d\n\u201cAbout the funeral I expect\u201d said Rudge to himself.",
    "But the note ran\nTHE\n\nDEAR INSPECTOR RUDGE\nI am anxious to run up to London this afternoon on an urgent matter\nconnected with my clerical duties.",
    "I hope that there will be no\nobjection to my doing so.",
    "I should not think of absenting myself if the\ncase were not of great importance since I know that you would prefer\nto have all your witnesses on the spot.",
    "However I trust that I shall not\nbe detained very long and I shall of course make a point of being\nback in time to attend the inquest which as I am informed by Mr.\nSkipworth will take place the day after tomorrow.",
    "I will keep you\ninformed as to my movements should you require to get in touch with\nme at any time and should I be detained overnight shall be staying at\nthe Charing Cross Hotel.",
    "Apologising for any inconvenience this request may cause you\nYours very truly\nPHILIP MOUNT.",
    "\u201cGood lord Another of them\u201d was the Inspector\u2019s mental comment.",
    "He stood\nfor a few moments undecided the note open in his hand.",
    "He had to make up his mind.",
    "If he forbade the Vicar to go\u2014well he could\nscarcely do that without committing himself to an accusation for which step he\nwas certainly not prepared.",
    "He could ask the Vicar not to go\u2014but behind the\ncourtesy of the expression the note seemed to carry a suggestion of mild\ndetermination.",
    "He had nothing definite against the Vicar except that his hat and\n\n\fhis coat had been found in a curious place and that he was a bad gardener.",
    "He\nturned to Peter.",
    "\u201cI think I\u2019d like to see your Dad if he can spare a few moments.\u201d\n\u201cRight you are.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you get across by the way\u201d\n\u201cYour new policeman brought the punt over for me\u2014but he isn\u2019t very good at\nit.\u201d\nRudge noted with satisfaction that Hempstead\u2019s deputy had arrived.",
    "That\nmeant that he himself would be free to leave Rundel Croft if he wanted to.",
    "He\nspoke a word or two to the new arrival\u2014a very stout man called Bancock\u2014\nstepped into the punt and was poled across by Peter.",
    "On the way up to the\nVicarage he noticed the drenched area round the summerhouse.",
    "The hose had\ncaught a clump of begonias at the edge of a gardenbed.",
    "One or two of the plants\nhad been actually broken by the force of the stream and on others the waterdrops were standing like miniature burningglasses under the bright sun.",
    "The\nVicar would probably wonder next day why their foliage should be speckled\nwith white heatblisters.",
    "The Vicar was in his study.",
    "He greeted Rudge cordially but his face looked a\nlittle drawn.",
    "No doubt he had received a severe shock thought Rudge.",
    "It was a\nstrong face though and handsome in its rather set ecclesiastical way.",
    "It looked\nhonest but you could never tell.",
    "According to local report the Vicar was a\nritualist and ritualists had odd ideas about the truth.",
    "They would for instance\nsubscribe to the Thirtynine Articles and then unblushingly invent ingenious\nways to get round them.",
    "Rudge was rather well up in the different varieties of\nparsons for his brotherinlaw was people\u2019s warden at St. Saviour\u2019s\nWhynmouth.",
    "\u201cWell Inspector I hope you haven\u2019t come to tell me that I mustn\u2019t go to\ntown.\u201d\n\u201cWell no sir\u2014not exactly.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t like to go so far as that though I don\u2019t\nsay but what I hadn\u2019t rather you stayed here.",
    "Still as I understand you to say the\nbusiness is urgent\u2014\u201d\nHe paused to give the Vicar time to explain what the business was but Mr.\nMount merely said\n\u201cOh yes it is very important.",
    "If it would have waited a couple of days I\nshould have tried to put it off but I fear that is quite impossible.\u201d\n\u201cI see sir.\u201d Rudge could not for the life of him see what clerical business\ncould be so urgent as that unless it was a summons from the Archbishop of\nCanterbury or an important conference and if it were why should not the Vicar\nsay so Mr. Mount\u2019s face displayed however only the bland severity of one\n\n\fabout to read the First Lesson.",
    "\u201cI take it that will be all right then Inspector\u201d\n\u201cOh yes sir.",
    "Provided as you say you keep in touch with us.",
    "And I\u2019m very\nmuch obliged to you for letting me know of your intentions.",
    "It isn\u2019t everybody\nwould be so considerate.\u201d\n\u201cWe both have our duty to do\u201d replied the Vicar.",
    "\u201cBesides\u201d he added with a\nslight twinkle \u201cif I had gone off without letting you know you might have\nimagined I was running away from you and that would never do.\u201d\nRudge laughed dutifully.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s just one or two things I was going to ask you sir\u201d he said \u201cand I\u2019m\nglad to have this opportunity.",
    "About the late Admiral Penistone.",
    "Should you say\nhe was a quick walker\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said the Vicar.",
    "\u201cAdmiral Penistone never cared to walk much owing to\na wound he got in his foot during the War.",
    "A piece of shrapnel I understand.",
    "He\nwas not actually lame but it tired him to walk very far or very fast.",
    "He always\npreferred to take the car or go by the river if possible.\u201d\nThe Inspector nodded.",
    "This upset his recent calculations and left him where he\nwas before.",
    "He went on to the next point.",
    "\u201cDo you sleep on the river side of the house sir\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "My sons and the servants sleep on that side but my bedroom window is\nat the other side overlooking the lane.",
    "Sometimes I get called up in the night to\nvisit the sick or dying and it is more convenient for them to be able to knock me\nup without disturbing the household.",
    "There is a sidedoor you see which opens\non to the lane with a bell which rings in my bedroom.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "Does your window command the high road\u201d\n\u201cYes in a sense.",
    "I mean I can see the road but it is of course a couple of\nhundred yards from the house.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so.",
    "I suppose you did not happen to see a closed car pass along last\nnight in the direction of Whynmouth\u201d\n\u201cThat is rather a vague question.",
    "At what time do you mean\u201d\n\u201cAt about a quarter to eleven.",
    "I thought perhaps you might have seen it when\nyou were undressing.\u201d\nThe Vicar shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said at once \u201cI am afraid I cannot help you.",
    "I came straight upstairs\nat tentwenty undressed and went to bed.",
    "I do not think I looked out of the\nwindow at all.",
    "But in any case at the time you mention I should be either in the\nbathroom along the passage or\u201d he twinkled again \u201csaying my prayers.\u201d\n\u201cJust so\u201d said Rudge embarrassed as every true Englishman is at the mention\nof private devotions.",
    "\u201cWell it was just a chance sir but a very slight one.",
    "I\n\n\fcouldn\u2019t really have expected you to notice.",
    "You\u2019ll be good enough to ring me\nup when you get to town sir\u201d\n\u201cI certainly will\u201d said the Vicar.",
    "\u201cAnd thank you very much for your\npermission to elope.",
    "I promise you that I will not break my parole.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure of that sir\u201d replied Rudge with conviction and took his\nleave.",
    "He strolled slowly back through the Vicarage garden his heavy boots\nsqueaking loudly on the gravel in the hot hush of the August morning.",
    "Peter was\nstill idling about the boathouse.",
    "Rudge looked at the post in the stream with the\nend of rope still fastened to it by a couple of halfhitches.",
    "He wondered whether\nhe had assumed too hastily that the body had been dumped into the Vicar\u2019s boat\nfrom another boat.",
    "He ought at least to take the precaution of examining the\nbank for footprints.",
    "Search however revealed nothing very helpful.",
    "The grass edge was crumpled\nand broken in places as it would naturally be if the Vicar\u2019s family were\naccustomed to board the boat from that point but the grass itself was too short\nand dry to show definite footprints and anything below highwater mark would\nnaturally have been obliterated when the tide came up that morning.",
    "Rudge sat down on the bank and stared at the river.",
    "The tide was just running\ndown to the slack and the ripples went clucking and clapping against the sides\nof the punt and the boathouse.",
    "On the other side lay the Admiral\u2019s boat\nshivering slightly as the wash of the stream lifted her stern and dimmed the\noutlines of her mirrored shape in among the brown shadows.",
    "Between bank and\nbank the sun blazed full on the water.",
    "Rudge found the tune running in his head\n\u2014\n\u201cOl\u2019 man River dat ol\u2019 man River.",
    "He must know sumfin\u2019 he don\u2019 say nuffin\u2019\u2014\u201d\nThat reminded him that he had promised to get his landlady Paul Robeson\u2019s\nrecord of \u201cSwing low sweet chariot.\u201d And his wireless needed a new\naccumulator.",
    "Curse the river with its perpetual chuckle and its imbecile tidal\nvagaries.",
    "He knew the Ouse at Huntingdon\u2014slow solitary regulated by pumps\nand weirs and little used for boating because of its derelict and weedgrown\nlocks.",
    "He had seen rivers in Scotland tumbling and brawling and full of stones\nuseful for nothing but for fishing in\u2014if you liked that kind of thing.",
    "He had even\ntaken a holiday trip to Ireland and seen the majestic Shannon harnessed and set\nto churning out electricity.",
    "But this river was a secretive beast and no good to\nanybody.",
    "What was the sense of a river with three feet between its high and low\n\n\ftide twice a day\nHe looked at the mooringpost again \u201cSwing low sweet charioot\u201d and\nmeasured with his eye the distance between the hitch of rope and the level of the\nriver.",
    "Nearly eight feet.",
    "Neddy was right.",
    "Anybody on the river waiting to loose\nthe boat at low tide would have to cut the painter.",
    "The boat would swing very\nlow indeed \u201ccoming for to carry me home\u201d and the painter would need to be a\nlong one if the boat was to ride in the water.",
    "Suddenly he got up started out of\nhis drowsy ruminations.",
    "\u201cI say sonny\u201d he said aloud.",
    "Peter emerged from the boathouse.",
    "\u201cHow long should you say your painter was\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about three fathoms\u2014eighteen feet you know.",
    "It has to be pretty long\nyou see to allow for the fall of the tide.\u201d\n\u201cYes I thought it would be.\u201d Rudge measured with his eye the end of rope as\nit trailed in the stream then tried to remember the look of the end left on the\nVicar\u2019s boat.",
    "Five feet or so at the most he thought.",
    "But he couldn\u2019t be sure.",
    "Probably it was quite all right but just as a matter of routine it wouldn\u2019t be a\nbad idea to fit the two cut ends together.",
    "He stared at the post again.",
    "He could\nsee clearly in his mind\u2019s eye the Vicar\u2019s boat with the new manilla cut through\nand Neddy Ware demonstrating on his plug of tobacco the sharpness of the knife\nthat had made the cut.",
    "The sun on the river was dazzling.",
    "Gazing at the post\nRudge\u2019s eyes swam with water.",
    "But it seemed to him that that end was cut less\ncleanly than the other.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d asked Peter staring first at the post and then at the Inspector.",
    "\u201cNothing much\u201d said Rudge \u201cjust a little job I thought of which I shall have\nto see to presently.",
    "I\u2019ll go across now I think if you are not wanting the punt.\u201d\nHe poled himself across without disaster and found P.C.",
    "Bancock stolidly\nreading a newspaper on the farther bank.",
    "Telling him to keep an eye on the\nhouse and to take any telephone messages Rudge hurriedly climbed into the\npolice car and drove round across Fernton Bridge to Lingham.",
    "The Vicar\u2019s boat\nwas there having been carefully loaded on to a farm cart and locked up in the\n\u201cDance Hall\u201d of the local pub where also lay in charge of the local undertaker\nthe body of Admiral Penistone.",
    "On consideration Rudge had thought this the\nbest arrangement since the inquest would have to be held at Lingham and it\nseemed better to leave the body there for the present bringing it back if\nnecessary to Rundel Croft for the funeral.",
    "But the body did not interest Rudge for the moment.",
    "The boat with its painter\nwas his object.",
    "On entering the \u201cDance Hall\u201d Rudge found the police\nphotographer in possession.",
    "He appeared to have reaped a rich crop of finger\n\n\fprints and was now methodically exposing plates upon them.",
    "Rudge nodded to\nhim to carry on and then pulling out a folding tapemeasure from his pocket he\nstretched it carefully along the painter.",
    "The precise measurement came out at\nfour feet nine inches from the cut end to the ring on the boat\u2019s nose.",
    "He came out again drove back cursing the silly necessity of having to go\nthree miles out of his way on every journey and returning to Rundel Croft got\nout the punt once more.",
    "Poling across to the mooringpost he took his\nmeasurements.",
    "From the bottom of the hitch to the end of the rope was eight feet and\nallowing for the rope used in surrounding the post and making the hitches and\nfor the spare end you got another three feet.",
    "That brought the whole length of\nrope on the post to eleven feet.",
    "Add four feet nine inches and you got a total of\nfifteen feet nine inches only.",
    "Two feet three inches of rope still remained\nunaccounted for.",
    "Rudge clinging affectionately with one arm to the post while he made his\nmeasurements and digging his toes well in to prevent the punt from drifting off\nand leaving him like a monkey on a stick shook his head at this.",
    "Then he took\nthe cut end of the painter in his hand and considered it attentively.",
    "He had been\nright.",
    "This was no clean cut like the other.",
    "A sharp knife had been used but the\nrope had parted gradually the strands loosening out under the strain and one\nfinal strand having ravelled out beyond the rest.",
    "He was left with his new puzzle.",
    "Why should anybody need a bit of rope only\na couple of feet long It could hardly have been used to tie anything up for the\nthickness of the rope meant that nearly the whole of this length would be taken\nup in making the knot.",
    "Well\u2014it was one more riddle.",
    "He pushed off from the post and took up the puntpole once more.",
    "That piece\nof rope ought to be found if possible.",
    "But probably it had merely been thrown\ninto the river and if so it would have gone out to sea by this time.",
    "Or since the\nridiculous Whyn flowed both ways it might have gone upstream after the\nAdmiral.",
    "That did not seem to be a very promising line of research.",
    "No message of any kind had been received at the house during his absence\nand not quite knowing what to do he wandered into the Admiral\u2019s study.",
    "There\nhe found the sergeant who after considerable backchat with the local\nexchange had succeeded in getting through to the Admiralty and was trying to\nexplain to a languid voice at the other end what department he wanted and whom\nhe wished to speak to.",
    "The Inspector took over the instrument.",
    "\u201cThis is the Whynmouth police\u201d he said in a peremptory tone calculated to\nconvey that though the Navy might be the Senior Service the Law was more\nimportant still.",
    "\u201cWe want information about the career of Admiral Penistone\n\n\fretired late of the Chinese Squadron and now living at Lingham.",
    "Will you\nkindly put me on to the proper person at once.",
    "The matter is urgent.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said the voice.",
    "\u201cWhat do you want to know about him I could look up\nhis record for you of course I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that\u201d said the Inspector.",
    "\u201cI want to speak confidentially to\nsomebody in authority\u2014and the quicker the better.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said the voice again.",
    "\u201cWell I don\u2019t know.",
    "You see everybody\u2019s out at\nlunch I think.",
    "One o\u2019clock you know.",
    "Look here.",
    "I think you\u2019d better ring up\nagain in an hour or two and ask for Extension fiftyfive\u2014they\u2019ll probably be\nable to tell you something there don\u2019t you know.",
    "I\u2019ll send them a chit about it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d The Inspector slammed the receiver down and after allowing\nthe statutory thirty seconds took it off again.",
    "\u201cNumber please\u201d said the exchange.",
    "\u201cLook here miss\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cHave you got a London telephone directory\nYou have.",
    "Good.",
    "Would you look up the number of Messrs. Dakers and Dakers\nfor me They\u2019re solicitors in\u2014wait a moment\u2014in Lincoln\u2019s Inn.",
    "Yes I\u2019ll spell\nthat.",
    "That\u2019s right Dakers and Dakers.",
    "It\u2019s rather urgent.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll rrring you\u201d said the exchange.",
    "The remarks of the young man at the Admiralty had reminded Rudge that he\nhad been on the job since six o\u2019clock and had had no breakfast.",
    "He rang the bell\nand asked Emery if he could be given something to eat.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said the retainer dubiously \u201cI don\u2019t know I suppose so.\u201d He\npondered and then added \u201cMe and Mrs. Emery was just sitting down to\ngammon rashers.",
    "I dare say you could have a gammon rasher if you fancied it.\u201d\nThe idea seemed good to the Inspector.",
    "He replied that he should fancy it very\nmuch indeed.",
    "\u201cWell I\u2019ll tell her\u201d said Emery.",
    "He went out and returned again in a few\nminutes.",
    "\u201cI suppose you would be wanting something to drink\u201d he suggested\nreluctantly.",
    "\u201cAnything that\u2019s going\u201d said Rudge pleasantly.",
    "\u201cWell I dare say you could have a glass of beer\u201d said Emery.",
    "\u201cMe and Mrs.\nEmery was just sitting down to a glass.",
    "Mrs. Emery felt she needed a drop of\nsomething to raise her spirits.\u201d\nThe Inspector readily accepted the offer of beer.",
    "Emery shambled slowly\naway returning presently to enquire\n\u201cIf I was to bring it in on a tray would that do for you We ain\u2019t never been\naccustomed to have the police about the place.\u201d\nThe Inspector signified that whatever was most convenient to Mr. and Mrs.\n\n\fEmery would suit him.",
    "The man retired again and after a considerable time\nreturned to announce in a mournful tone\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Emery says you can have a gammon rasher if you want it.",
    "She says she\nhasn\u2019t made no sweet today on account of being low in her spirits but perhaps\na piece of the Stilton would do for you.\u201d\nThe Inspector replied that it would do admirably and at that moment the\ntelephone rang.",
    "On answering it Rudge found that he was through to Mr.\nDakers\u2019s office.",
    "Mr. Edwin Dakers and Mr. Trubody were both out.",
    "Could the\nspeaker do anything\nThe Inspector explained that he wanted to speak urgently to Mr. Edwin\nDakers on business connected with Admiral Penistone.",
    "No he was not speaking\nfor the Admiral.",
    "The Admiral in fact was dead.",
    "\u201cIndeed Mr. Dakers will be very sorry to hear that.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact\u201d said the Inspector \u201che has died under very mysterious\ncircumstances.",
    "I represent the police.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed Mr. Dakers will be greatly distressed.",
    "If you will give me your\nnumber I will ask him to ring you as soon as he comes in.\u201d\nThe Inspector thanked the speaker and then remembered that Sergeant\nAppleton was still somewhere about and unfed.",
    "He rang the bell again.",
    "Emery\nshuffled in and began at once with a reproachful expression.",
    "\u201cNow it ain\u2019t no good you ringing.",
    "Nobody can\u2019t hurry a gammon rasher.",
    "They wants a good deal of cooking if they ain\u2019t to give you bile.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so\u201d said Rudge \u201cbut I was thinking about my sergeant.",
    "Do you think\nyou could manage a meal for him too\u201d\n\u201cThe sergeant\u201d said Emery \u201cis taking a bite in the kitchen along of me and\nMrs. Emery.",
    "No offence I hope.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not no\u201d said Rudge \u201cI\u2019m very glad he should.\u201d Emery withdrew\nagain while the Inspector pondered on Sergeant Appleton\u2019s superior enterprise\nand resourcefulness.",
    "The gammon rasher\u2014cut thick and well fried up\u2014was brought in by Mrs.\nEmery a little birdlike woman with snapping eyes and a masterfulness of\nmanner which explained to some extent her husband\u2019s crushed and wilted\nappearance.",
    "A single glance at the perfectlycooked rasher with its\naccompanying green peas and chips explained another riddle.",
    "Evidently\nEmery\u2019s feeblemindedness was the price the Admiral paid for Mrs. Emery\u2019s\nculinary skill.",
    "Rudge expressed his appreciation.",
    "\u201cAnd how I could bring myself to do it I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know\u201d said Mrs.\nEmery \u201cwith the poor master gone so sudden and Miss Elma away and the\n\n\fwhole place in a uproar.",
    "Even the very smell of the meat seems almost \u2019eartless\nas you might say.",
    "But there that Emery is a man and man must \u2019ave \u2019is meat if\nthe \u2019ole world was to be swallowed up in Noah\u2019s flood.\u201d\n\u201cTrue\u201d said the Inspector \u201cwe are a callous sex I\u2019m afraid Mrs. Emery.",
    "It\u2019s\na great upset to you naturally.",
    "And with Miss Fitzgerald going away\nunexpectedly it\u2019s all left on your shoulders.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Mrs. Emery.",
    "\u201cAnd when isn\u2019t it left on my shoulders I should like\nto know A lot Miss Elma troubled herself about the house.",
    "Might be a man for\nall the help she was.",
    "Now the poor Admiral he liked to have things pleasant\nabout him and for all he was sharp in his ways it was a pleasure to serve him.",
    "Many\u2019s the time I\u2019ve had to speak sharp to Emery for I could see as his shiftless\nways was a hard trial to the master\u2014but there Emery\u2019s but a poor creature\nthough he is my husband.",
    "The Admiral he gave him notice to leave at the end of\nthe month but there I didn\u2019t pay no attention.",
    "I just cooked him a nice dinner\nsuch as he had a fancy for and he said to me \u2018Mrs.",
    "Emery tell that blistering\nswab of a husband of yours that he can stay on and here\u2019s half a guinea for you\nto buy a bit o\u2019 ribbon.\u2019 He was a good master and I\u2019d say so if I was on my\ndeathbed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of it\u201d said Rudge sympathetically.",
    "He felt that he had\nunaccountably neglected Mrs. Emery.",
    "If you want the truth about a man\u2019s\ncharacter he had always maintained ask the servants.",
    "He now had two\ntestimonies in the Admiral\u2019s favour and he felt they were to be relied upon.",
    "Neddy Ware had echoed the opinion of the Admiral\u2019s own crew\u2014and a crew is\nseldom mistaken about its captain.",
    "And Mrs. Emery\u2019s evidence agreed with\ntheirs.",
    "\u201cI suppose\u201d he said \u201cthat Admiral Penistone was a bit shorttempered at\ntimes eh\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think none the worse of him for that\u201d retorted Mrs. Emery.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d\nrather a man was shorttempered than poorspirited any day.",
    "And the master had\na lot to put up with.",
    "What with Miss Elma treating him so bad and his worries\nand one thing and another\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat worries were those\u201d\n\u201cWell now Inspector I don\u2019t know as I could rightly say what worries.",
    "But I\ndid hear as he hadn\u2019t been treated proper by the Admiralty when he was a young\nman and he never rightly got over it.",
    "Something to do with foreign parts it was\nand he\u2019d say that he\u2019d get himself set right yet if it took him a lifetime.",
    "But Miss\nElma she hadn\u2019t no more sympathy with him than a man hasn\u2019t when you\u2019re\nfratcheted to death with babies.\u201d Without pausing to explain this obscure\ncomparison Mrs. Emery went on still more rapidly.",
    "\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t listen to a\n\n\fword Miss Elma wouldn\u2019t just sat there looking as sulky as a cow and wouldn\u2019t\nso much as put her hand to a duster or put up a vase of flowers to make the place\nlook homelike.",
    "And sorry I\u2019m sure I am for Mr. Holland and him such a nice\ngentleman if he marries our young lady though what he could see in her I don\u2019t\nknow.",
    "It\u2019s a miracle to me with all these decent sensible girls about that a man\nwill always pick on the wrong sort and as to being goodlooking I never could\nsee it.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Rudge \u201cit\u2019s past praying for now.",
    "They were married this\nmorning.\u201d\n\u201cWell I never\u201d said Mrs. Emery.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what your sergeant was looking so\nsly about \u2018There\u2019s a surprise in store for you ma\u2019am\u2019 he says \u2018but I\u2019ll not tell\nyou\u2019 he says \u2018for you\u2019ll be hearing it soon enough.\u2019 Fancy But if that isn\u2019t just\nlike Miss Elma before her poor uncle\u2019s cold as you might say the \u2019eartless\n\u2019ussy And surprised I am at Mr. Holland doing such a thing but there\nAnything she said he followed like a lamb with a blue ribbon round its neck but\nthem big fellows is often the meekest when it comes to a woman.\u201d\n\u201cYou think Mr. Holland is very fond of Miss Fitzgerald then\u201d suggested\nRudge.",
    "Would he ever get to the bottom of the relations between this pair No\ntwo people seemed to agree about them.",
    "\u201cFond he was\u201d said Mrs. Emery \u201cand is I\u2019ve no doubt though how long it\nlasts is another matter.",
    "She took it cool enough but that\u2019s her way.",
    "Herself and\nher fancies that\u2019s all that young lady ever was in love with if you ask me and\nhe\u2019ll soon find it out.",
    "Things look different when you\u2019re married.",
    "Artful she was\ntoo leading him on and putting him off as the fancy took her.",
    "But as to caring\nfor him no and the master knew that as well as anybody.",
    "If he\u2019d been alive they\nwouldn\u2019t have got married so easy and that\u2019s a fact but to go right off and join\ntheir \u2019ands over his dead body as you might say is what I shouldn\u2019t hardly have\nthought Mr. Holland capable of.\u201d\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said the Inspector.",
    "He was trying to remember how long it took to get\na special license.",
    "He seemed to remember dimly that it required at least a day\u2019s\nnotice.",
    "\u201cMaybe they had planned to get married today in any case.\u201d\n\u201cThen they ought to have altered their plan\u201d replied Mrs. Emery.",
    "\u201cDisgusting\nI call it.",
    "But I shouldn\u2019t wonder if they had come to think of it.",
    "Maybe that\u2019s\nwhat Mr. Holland was so anxious to see the Admiral about last night.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "He rang up from Whynmouth didn\u2019t he\u201d\n\u201cHe did.",
    "I took the message myself.",
    "Wanted to see the master very urgent.",
    "I\nsaid as him and Miss Elma was over at the Vicarage and wouldn\u2019t be back till\nlate\u2014for I expected they\u2019d stop to eleven o\u2019clock or such playing cards or\nsomething of that.",
    "The Vicar don\u2019t mind playing cards for all he\u2019s such a man\n\n\ffor services and saints\u2019 days but that\u2019s only to be expected for fancy dress and\ncandles is not what you could call religion don\u2019t you think so yourself Well I\nsaid to him they won\u2019t be back till eleven I said saying what I thought right at\nthe time which I couldn\u2019t be expected to know they would be early that night of\nall nights.",
    "One can but act for the best.",
    "So I said why not go over to the\nVicarage but Mr. Holland says \u2018no he\u2019ll leave it and perhaps he might come up\nlater.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnd did he\u201d\n\u201cNot that I know of but there I\u2019m a sound sleeper thank God and need to be\nthe work there is in this house.",
    "Emery he\u2019s supposed to do the cleaning but half\nthe time I has to do it after him and as for Jennie she\u2019s a good girl but run off\nher feet by Miss Elma as won\u2019t do step or stitch for herself.",
    "Cooking is what I\nwas engaged to do and with Miss Elma breakfasting in bed and getting up at all\nhours I\u2019ve only got one pair of hands.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so\u201d said Rudge \u201cand very capable ones I\u2019m sure they are Mrs.\nEmery.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I said when I come here as I ought to have a kitchenmaid under me\nwith all these brick floors.",
    "That\u2019s the worst of these oldfashioned houses.",
    "But\nI\u2019ve no complaint of the Admiral for a rich man he was not not but what she\nmight have done something to help him if she had liked for she\u2019s got plenty so\nI\u2019m told.",
    "And what she did with her allowance it\u2019s difficult to say not that it\u2019s\nany of my business for it\u2019s not but nobody can\u2019t help their thoughts.",
    "And spend\nit on dress she did not nobody could say that against her barring an evening\nfrock now and again or a handsome coat.",
    "But them\u2019s not the things as takes the\nmoney as you\u2019ll know well enough if you\u2019re a married man.",
    "It\u2019s the shoes and\ngloves and bags and stockings and jumpers.",
    "And I\u2019m sure Miss Elma bothered as\nlittle about them as a young lady could do.",
    "That French maid she had she used\nto complain dreadful of the shabby way Miss Elma went about.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes\u2014the French girl.",
    "What was she like\u201d\n\u201cGirl\u201d said Mrs. Emery.",
    "\u201cThey calls \u2019em all girls nowadays.",
    "But if ever she\nsees forty again I\u2019ll be surprised.",
    "A nice little thing enough to speak to and\nspoke English beautiful.",
    "But I don\u2019t like a maid as is too intimate with her\nmistress.",
    "I\u2019ve seen Miss Elma catch that woman\u2019s eye sometimes when the\nmaster happened to be a bit put out and looks pass between them which did not\nought to pass between persons in their stations of life.",
    "Let servants stick together\nand masters stick together\u2014that\u2019s my motto but for young ladies to be taking\ntheir maids into their confidences about the master of the house is unbecoming\nto my way of thinking.",
    "It\u2019s my belief there was some trouble about it or why did\nMa\u2019amselle go off so quick without her wages There\u2019s the front door bell\n\n\fwho\u2019ll that be I wonder I hope Emery is answering it as it\u2019s his place to do\nbut he\u2019s that flustered with all this.",
    "You\u2019ll have noticed I dare say as his head\u2019s\nnot very strong.",
    "Now I\u2019m different.",
    "I\u2019m one of the noticing sort.",
    "I may have\nbeen only a month with the Admiral but a woman that\u2019s experienced\u2014and I\u2019ve\nbeen in many places in my time\u2014don\u2019t take long putting two and two together.",
    "Oh I could size up Miss Elma all right.",
    "Ah Emery has remembered his duty for\nonce I\u2019m glad to say.\u201d\nThe door opened and Emery poked in his melancholy head.",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s two newspaper gentlemen waiting to see the Inspector.\u201d\nRudge was about to consign the newspaper gentlemen to a warm spot when it\noccurred to him that all God\u2019s creatures have their uses.",

    "Why he sent in his\npapers at fortythree and why he rejoined the Navy afterwards and all about it.\u201d\n\u201cOh I can tell you something about that\u201d the reporter laughed.",
    "\u201cI got that out\nof a man I know in the Chinese Embassy.",
    "The old boy got into trouble in Hong\nKong in 1911.",
    "Some private matter.",
    "Something to do with a woman.",
    "One of the\nthings that aren\u2019t done by naval officers.",
    "He was requested to send in his papers.",
    "No public scandal\u2014you know the sort of thing.",
    "My man didn\u2019t know all the\ndetails but he promised to get them for me.",
    "I\u2019ll let you have anything I get hold\nof.",
    "I dare say we shan\u2019t print it all because some of the parties may be alive but\nI\u2019ll send you the dope on the whole thing.",
    "And I say\u2014if there\u2019s anything\ncoming along that you feel you can let us have straight from the geegee\u2019s\nmouth you will won\u2019t you That\u2019s a bargain.\u201d\nRudge agreed readily enough.",
    "This was a great deal more hopeful than\nunwinding red tape from the Admiralty.",
    "Trouble in Hong Kong in 1911 That\nexplained matters.",
    "No doubt as Penistone was a smart officer they were glad\nenough to let him rejoin in 1914.",
    "But it would have made a difference to him\nnaturally.",
    "Soured the old boy\u2019s temper a bit no doubt.",
    "Was it possible that the\nmurder was the aftermath of that old affair It seemed a long time to keep up\nresentment but where Chinks were concerned you never knew.",
    "And by the way\nHolland had lately come from China.",
    "What was that Mrs. Emery had said about\nHolland He had said he might walk over to Rundel Croft after eleven.",
    "Suppose\nhe had done so\nObviously Holland and Elma must be got hold of.",
    "They would have to be\nsubp naed for the inquest in any case.",
    "He must tackle the coroner about that.",
    "A\nlittle job for Sergeant Appleton.",
    "He returned to the house and despatched his\nsubordinate with a note.",
    "Hardly had he done so when the telephone rang.",
    "Mr. Edwin Dakers was on the line.",
    "He was indeed grieved and horrified to\nhear of the Admiral\u2019s death.",
    "He thought he had better come down to Rundel\nCroft at once.",
    "As Miss Fitzgerald\u2019s trustee and representative it would be\nnecessary for him to see her without delay.",
    "Doubtless she was greatly upset by\nthis melancholy occurrence.",
    "\u201cI haven\u2019t noticed it\u201d replied Rudge with a sort of grim satisfaction.",
    "\u201cIn fact\nno sooner did Miss Fitzgerald hear of her uncle\u2019s death than she went up to town\nand got married to a Mr. Holland.",
    "I should be glad sir\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d said Mr. Dakers in a tone so aghast that it seemed to shake the\n\n\finstrument.",
    "Rudge repeated his information.",
    "\u201cGod bless my soul\u201d said Mr. Dakers and paused for such a long time that\nRudge began to think he had fallen dead with horror.",
    "Then he said\n\u201cThis is very unfortunate indeed Inspector.",
    "I am more than shocked.",
    "I am\nhorrified.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly looks a bit unfeeling\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cUnfeeling\u201d said Mr. Dakers.",
    "\u201cIt may be most gravely prejudicial to her\nmonetary interests.",
    "Can you tell me where to find her\u201d\n\u201cThey were staying at the Carlton she said\u201d replied Rudge.",
    "\u201cMiss Fitzgerald\n\u2014that is Mrs. Holland\u2014\u201d Mr. Dakers groaned faintly \u201cmentioned that they\nwere going to a dance this evening.",
    "I should be glad sir\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA dance at the Carlton\u201d interrupted the lawyer.",
    "\u201cShe must be out of her\nsenses.",
    "T\u2019chk t\u2019chk t\u2019chk.",
    "Most distressing.",
    "I am not quite clear upon the point\nof law involved but if I remember rightly the Master of the Rolls held in the\ncase of\u2014dear me I think I shall have to take Counsel\u2019s opinion.",
    "In the\nmeanwhile I thank you very much for apprising me of these events.",
    "I shall go\nand see my client immediately and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI hope you will sir and I should be very glad if you could persuade her to\ncome back at once.",
    "Mr. and Mrs. Holland will be subp naed of course but in\nthe meantime it would be desirable\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOf course of course\u201d replied Mr. Dakers \u201cmost unfortunate and\nunbecoming.",
    "I shall make a point of advising her to return home without delay.\u201d\n\u201cThank you sir and I should be very glad sir if I might have a word with\nyou at some time myself.",
    "There are one or two little matters which I should like\nto have cleared up in connection with a document we have here.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said Mr. Dakers.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cIn connection\u201d pursued Rudge \u201cwith a copy of a will sir made by John\nMartin Fitzgerald in 1915.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Mr. Dakers.",
    "His voice sounded cautious.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Yes I see.",
    "In what\nway precisely are you interested in that will\u201d\nRudge coughed.",
    "\u201cWell sir in a general way as you might say.",
    "There\u2019s a brother mentioned in\nit for example and one or two other points that might be of interest.\u201d\n\u201cYes I see.",
    "Well Inspector I think the best way will be for me to see you\nmyself.",
    "I will endeavour to bring Miss Fitz\u2014that is Mrs. Holland down with\nme but in any case I shall arrive at Lingham tonight.",
    "Where shall I find you\u201d\n\u201cI shall be at Rundel Croft sir.\u201d\n\u201cVery well.",
    "I will telephone you when to expect me.",
    "When are you holding\n\n\fthe inquest\u201d\n\u201cI should think the day after tomorrow sir.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I shall be there of course to represent Mrs. Holland.",
    "I think I should\nhave been notified of this matter earlier.",
    "How is it that you did not ring me up till\none o\u2019clock\u201d\nThe Inspector would have liked to say that it was not his business to notify the\nsolicitors of suspected or suspicious persons but he replied meekly that he had\nbeen busy and had only just had time to digest the contents of the will.",
    "\u201cIt is unfortunate\u201d he added \u201cthat Mrs. Holland did not herself acquaint you\nwith the state of affairs.\u201d\n\u201cIt is very\u201d replied the lawyer dryly.",
    "\u201cVery well Inspector we will leave it\nlike that.\u201d\nHe rang off.",
    "\u201cAnd that\u2019s that\u201d thought Rudge discontentedly.",
    "\u201cNothing for it I suppose\nbut to wait for the old blighter.",
    "Still if he brings the Hollands back that\u2019s\nsomething to the good.",
    "It\u2019s a pity there seems to be so little one can get on with.",
    "Hollands gone to town Denny gone to town.",
    "Well what about those cuttings\u201d\nHe had not yet looked through the file of newspaper cuttings.",
    "They might\nperhaps suggest something in connection with Penistone\u2019s mysterious past.",
    "Or\nthere might be other papers of interest.",
    "The cuttings as he had rather expected seemed mostly to have to do with\nChina though a section of them seemed to be concerned with naval affairs.",
    "They\ndated from two years before the War and were neatly numbered and docketed to\ncorrespond with an alphabetical index in the Admiral\u2019s handwriting.",
    "Rudge\nnoted a small bunch of cuttings collected under the heading \u201cDenny W.\u201d These\nhe turned over eagerly.",
    "They told him that Sir Wilfrid Denny had been for many\nyears in the Hong Kong customs retiring in 1921 with a title and pension.",
    "Apparently Denny had only come to Whynmouth in 1925 having previously\nlived in Hertfordshire.",
    "He was a widower of sixtyfour his wife having died\nfifteen years previously in China.",
    "He had no surviving children his only son\nhad been killed in the War.",
    "This was interesting.",
    "Sir Wilfrid then had also been connected with China.",
    "No doubt his friendship with the Admiral had dated from the latter\u2019s period of\nservice on the Chinese station.",
    "Rudge returned the cuttings to their folder and\nwas about to replace them in their file when he noticed an endorsement on the\nfolder \u201cSee H 5 and X 57.\u201d\nWhat this cryptic reference might mean he could not think.",
    "He tried number\nfive in the H file and found that it referred to a single cutting about an Able\nSeaman named Hendry who had been killed in a brawl in Hong Kong some\n\n\fyears previously.",
    "This looked hopeful but in turning to file X he found no\nentries under that awkward letter.",
    "And indeed fiftyseven entries under X would\nhe thought be unusual.",
    "\u201cX\u201d must refer to something different.",
    "To what\nHe turned to the alphabetical list and under the letter F his eye was arrested\nby another entry.",
    "\u201cFitzgerald W. E.\u201d The missing brother of Elma Surely this\nwould be of interest.",
    "Eagerly he turned up the file.",
    "The folder marked \u201cFitzgerald W. E.\u201d contained nothing but a slip of paper\non which was scribbled in pencil \u201cSee X.\u201d\n\u201cDamn X\u201d thought Rudge \u201cwhere the devil has \u2018X\u2019 gone to Perhaps it was\nparticularly private.",
    "The old boy may have hidden it in some safer place.\u201d\nFilled with excitement he began a thorough and careful search of the cabinet\nand the desk.",
    "The cabinet yielded nothing nor on a superficial examination did\nthe desk.",
    "At length however after lifting a mass of receipts and old chequebooks out of the well of the desk Rudge came to a sliding bottom.",
    "He pushed\nthis back and disclosed a keyhole.",
    "A little search of the Admiral\u2019s keyring\nrevealed a key of suitable size.",
    "He fitted it in.",
    "It turned easily.",
    "The door slid back\nand disclosed a folder similar to those in the cabinet and marked \u201cX.\u201d\nBefore he had lifted it out Rudge knew that he was to be disappointed.",
    "The\nfolder lay flat as a visitingcard and was in fact perfectly empty.",
    "He was still gazing at it in chagrin when the door opened to admit Jennie with\na teatray.",
    "\u201cSo you\u2019re back Jennie\u201d said Rudge pleasantly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you to\nbring me tea.",
    "Is your mother better\u201d\n\u201cWell she\u2019s none so good Mr. Rudge thank you.",
    "Doctor he says it\u2019s her\nback.",
    "He\u2019s been down to her twice today and she\u2019s a bit easier now but she\u2019s\nstill very low.\u201d\nRudge expressed his sympathy and noted that the sick mother seemed to be\ngenuine enough.",
    "When he had eaten his tea he continued his search for the\nmissing contents of the folder but without success.",
    "Three telephone calls came\nto break the monotony one from the coroner asking Rudge to come and see him\nfirst thing next morning the next from Mr. Dakers to say that he was still trying\nto get in touch with the Hollands and would be down on the eightfifty the third\nmuch later from the Vicar.",
    "\u201cI am speaking from the Charing Cross Hotel\u201d said the crisp Oxford voice.",
    "\u201cI\nfind I shall be obliged to spend the night in town.",
    "I will ring you up again in the\nmorning.\u201d\nRudge thanked him and rang off.",
    "Then after a minute or two he took an\nobvious precaution.",
    "He rang up the Charing Cross Hotel.",
    "\u201cHave you a Mr. Mount\u2014Rev.",
    "Philip Mount\u2014staying in the hotel\u201d\n\n\fA slight pause then \u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\u201cIs Mr. Mount in the hotel\u201d\n\u201cI will enquire will you hold the line sir\u201d\nA subdued babel then the metallic clack of advancing footsteps and the rattle\nof the receiver.",
    "\u201cHullo yes who is it please\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s him all right\u201d thought Rudge.",
    "Aloud he said \u201cI just remembered\nsomething I wanted to ask you sir\u201d and repeated his question about the length\nof the painter.",
    "The Vicar confirmed Peter\u2019s statement and Rudge thanked him and rang off.",
    "\u201cAll O.K.",
    "so far.",
    "I didn\u2019t like him going off like that but he seems straight\nenough.",
    "Hope he is because of these kids.",
    "But that rope\u2019s a teaser and no\nmistake.\u201d\nThe eightfifty arrived at Whynmouth in due course and presently a taxi drew\nup at Rundel Croft.",
    "Rudge heard it turn up the drive and stop.",
    "His hopes rose\nthen sank again as he heard the doorbell.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Holland would have walked in\u201d he muttered disappointed.",
    "\u201cBut no\u201d\nHe cheered up again.",
    "\u201cThe door\u2019s locked of course because of possible\nintruders.\u201d\nEmery\u2019s steps shuffled through the hall.",
    "The study door opened and a tall\nthin greyheaded man was shown in\u2014alone.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Dakers\u201d said Rudge rising and executing something between a salute\nand a bow.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said the lawyer \u201cand you I take it are Inspector Rudge.",
    "Quite so.",
    "Well now Inspector I am sorry to say I have failed to see either Mr. or Mrs.\nHolland.",
    "They are certainly staying at the Carlton and were expected back to\ndinner.",
    "I have left a note for Mrs. Holland expressed in such terms that I think\nshe can scarcely fail to pay attention to it.",
    "I need not say again how shocked and\ngrieved I am at the whole occurrence.\u201d\n\u201cI quite see your point of view sir\u201d said Rudge \u201cand I may add that the\nabsence of Mr. and Mrs. Holland is making my own task none the easier.",
    "By the\nway sir I am in a somewhat peculiar position in this house with Admiral\nPenistone dead and nobody else in charge so to speak but I dare say I shan\u2019t be\nout of order in asking you if you have dined before we go on to business.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Inspector thank you\u2014but I require nothing.",
    "I am obliged to you.",
    "I should like to hear at once all the details of this sad affair.\u201d\nRudge rapidly outlined the circumstances of the Admiral\u2019s death and the\ndeparture of his niece while Mr. Dakers contributed a running commentary of\n\u201cTuts\u201d and \u201cDear dears.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThere seems to be no doubt then that Admiral Penistone was murdered.\u201d\n\u201cNone at all I am afraid sir.\u201d\n\u201cHe could not I suppose have\u2014er\u2014made away with himself and thrown the\nweapon into the river.\u201d\nThis solution had not presented itself to Rudge but he replied that judging by\nthe position of the body and the general circumstances he thought it almost\noutside the bounds of probability.",
    "Mr. Dakers nodded mournfully.",
    "\u201cI take it\u201d he said with the air of a man taking a ferocious bull by the horns\n\u201cthat there is\u2014er\u2014no suspicion attaching to my ward or her husband\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Rudge cautiously \u201cI couldn\u2019t say that suspicion attaches to any\nparticular person so far.",
    "And other things being equal the crime is certainly not\nthe kind that we would suspect a young lady of.",
    "We know very little as yet about\nMr. Holland.",
    "Possibly you can help us there sir\u201d\nMr. Dakers shook his head.",
    "\u201cI know very little about him beyond his name and the fact that he was in a\nmanner engaged to my ward.\u201d\n\u201cDid the engagement have Admiral Penistone\u2019s consent sir\u201d\nThe lawyer looked very shrewdly at him.",
    "\u201cI see what is in your mind Inspector.",
    "Well I suppose that is only to be\nexpected and it is quite useless for me to attempt to disguise the facts.",
    "So far as I\nknow Admiral Penistone while reluctant as yet to give his consent to the\nmarriage had not definitely forbidden it.",
    "That is as much as I can tell you.\u201d\n\u201cI see sir.",
    "Now about this will of John Martin Fitzgerald I presume that Mr.\nFitzgerald is dead since you and the late Admiral were acting as trustees for\nMrs. Holland.",
    "Is this the copy of the actual will that was proved at the time of\ndeath\u201d\n\u201cIt is.",
    "My friend John Fitzgerald was a solicitor he died in 1916 and this was\nhis latest will.",
    "I cannot say that it was a will I should have cared to draw up for\nhim myself nor was it I think a will he would willingly have drawn for one of\nhis clients but you know Inspector solicitors are notorious for making bad\ndisposals of their own property.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the will proved at\u201d\n\u201cAt about \u00a350000.",
    "That\u201d said Mr. Dakers \u201cdid not represent the rewards of\nthe law the greater part of the money was inherited.",
    "But I had better begin from\nthe beginning.",
    "John Fitzgerald married in 1888 Mary Penistone the sister of the\nlate Admiral.",
    "She died in 1911 and left two surviving children Walter Everett\nborn in 1889 and Elma Mary born nine years later in 1898.",
    "When Walter was\ntwenty he got into some kind of trouble at home.",
    "I think it had to do with a\n\n\fyoung woman who was attached to the family in a dependent position\u2014in fact\nthe governess.",
    "His father was extremely angry and there was a terrible quarrel.",
    "Young Walter ran away from home and disappeared and for some time his\nname was not allowed to be mentioned.",
    "You know the kind of thing.",
    "Elma of\ncourse was too young to be told what the trouble was about but Mrs. Fitzgerald\nalways considered that her husband was too hard upon the boy.",
    "\u201cShe died as I say in 1911 and I really think the worry about Walter helped\nto break up her health\u2014in fact as we used to say it broke her heart.",
    "I know John\nFitzgerald thought so and it had a very softening effect upon him.",
    "He made\nefforts to find Walter though without success and he executed a will dividing\nhis property between Walter and Elma.",
    "\u201cNothing was heard of Walter till the early part of 1915 when he sent his\nfather a letter written from \u2018Somewhere in France.\u2019 He expressed himself as\nsorry for his previous bad behaviour and six years of neglect hoped he was\nforgiven and said that he was now endeavouring to turn over a new leaf and do\nhis duty to his country.",
    "No word about where he had been in the interval.",
    "At the\nsame time he enclosed \u2018in case of accident\u2019 a will drawn in favour of his sister\nElma.",
    "His father and sister wrote back at once telling him to come home as soon\nas he got leave and that all would be forgiven and forgotten.",
    "He never did come\nhome though he wrote from time to time and after the disastrous battle of Loos\nhis name appeared in the lists of \u2018missing believed killed.\u2019 His father was at that\ntime a very sick man.",
    "He was suffering from Bright\u2019s disease and had not very\nmuch longer to live.",
    "He absolutely refused to believe that Walter was dead.",
    "He\nhad turned up before he said and would turn up again.",
    "Having in the meantime\ncome into a large property he redrafted his will of 1911 leaving the disposition\nof his estate the same as before but with certain additional clauses.",
    "\u201cI must now say a word about his brotherinlaw Admiral Penistone.",
    "He\u2014\nyou may know something about his history\u201d\n\u201cI have heard that there was some sort of interruption to his career in 1911.\u201d\n\u201cOh you know about that Yes a disgraceful business.",
    "I need not go into\ndetails but the affair was one which made it extremely unsuitable that he should\nbe appointed as guardian of the young girl.",
    "Understand me I express no opinion\nas to whether Captain Penistone as he was then was actually to blame in the\nmatter.",
    "But the mere fact that his name had been connected with such an\nunsavoury business should have been sufficient.",
    "However John Fitzgerald who\nnever would believe ill of anybody\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAn unusual trait in a lawyer\u201d Rudge could not help remarking.",
    "\u201cMy good man a lawyer in his private capacity and in his professional\ncapacity may be two very different people\u201d retorted Mr. Dakers with some\n\n\fasperity.",
    "\u201cJohn Fitzgerald could not think ill of his wife\u2019s brother.",
    "He maintained\nthat Penistone had been unfairly treated and by way of showing the world what\nhe thought about it he made him Elma\u2019s trustee and inserted that preposterous\nclause about her marriage.\u201d\n\u201cYou yourself\u201d suggested Rudge \u201caccepted cotrusteeship with Admiral\nPenistone.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I had not\u201d said Mr. Dakers \u201che might have appointed some other\nblack sheep who needed whitewashing.",
    "No.",
    "I made the best of a bad job out of\nconsideration for my poor friend\u2019s daughter.",
    "And I must say in justice to\nAdmiral Penistone that I have had no cause to complain of his management of\nhis ward\u2019s affairs.",
    "Although his manner was abrupt and at times disagreeable I\nbelieve him to have been a perfectly honest man as regards money nor was there\nanything unbecoming about the household he set up for his niece.",
    "Had there\nbeen I should of course have interfered.\u201d\n\u201cBy whose wish was it that Miss Fitzgerald went to live with her uncle\u201d\n\u201cBy her father\u2019s.",
    "I thought it unsuitable but I could produce no valid grounds\nof opposition.",
    "Elma\u2019s share of the money was invested by my advice in sound\nsecurities and the payments made to her quarterly by the trustees.\u201d\n\u201cA very nice little income\u201d remarked Rudge.",
    "\u201cAbout \u00a31500 a year.\u201d\n\u201cIt surprises me a little\u201d said Rudge \u201cthat the Admiral did not keep up a more\nelaborate establishment for his niece.",
    "This house is pleasant enough but it is\nvery remote and they did not see much company or so I understand.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true\u201d admitted Mr. Dakers \u201cbut it was not altogether Admiral\nPenistone\u2019s fault.",
    "He himself naturally shrank from going much into society and\nfrom 1914 to 1918 he was of course on active service but he put no restrictions\nupon his niece.",
    "She was given a good education and had the advantage of two\nLondon seasons under the chaperonage of a very suitable lady but I fancy that\nsociety life was distasteful to her.\u201d\n\u201cOdd that she should not have got married earlier\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cA young\nlady with \u00a325000 or so should have had plenty of offers.\u201d\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cI fancy that Elma was\u2014a little difficult\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cShe is perhaps not\u2014\nattractive in what I may call the marrying sense.",
    "There were some\u2014needy\npersons of course but they were not encouraged.",
    "Admiral Penistone would not\nhave dreamed of consenting to a marriage except with a man of independent\nmeans.",
    "And then unfortunately there was the scandal about Walter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that\u201d\n\u201cWhy that happened in 1920.",
    "Obviously the first thing that seemed advisable\n\n\fwas to obtain from the Courts leave to presume Walter\u2019s death.",
    "We could not do\nanything till 1919 after the release of the British prisoners of war in Germany.",
    "His name was in none of the lists and we expected to encounter no difficulty.",
    "Curiously enough however a man turned up who had been in Walter\u2019s unit in\n1915 and this man stated that he had seen Walter alive in BudaPesth after the\ncessation of hostilities.",
    "He said he had not spoken to him but that he had no\ndoubt whatever of his identity.",
    "Walter was I believe a strikingly handsome man\n\u2014he certainly was handsome as a boy.",
    "He was very like his mother who was a\nmost beautiful woman much betterlooking than her brother the Admiral\nthough there was a strong family resemblance.",
    "\u201cWell of course that meant further delay and more enquiries.",
    "We could get\nno news of Walter at all but in view of the evidence of the soldier the Court\nrefused to presume death\u2014naturally.",
    "Meanwhile the affair had a very\nunfortunate sequel.",
    "As soon as it became known that Walter had probably not\nbeen killed during the War we got the news that there was a warrant out for his\narrest in Shanghai for forgery if you please.\u201d\n\u201cIn Shanghai\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "The warrant dated from 1914.",
    "Apparently Walter when he left the\ncountry in 1909 had entered the employment of the AngloAsiatic Tobacco\nCompany.",
    "He was in Hong Kong at first and in 1913 was transferred to\nShanghai.",
    "He got into some sort of financial difficulties I suppose.",
    "Anyway he\nforged a signature of a client of the Company to a large cheque and ran away.",
    "The War broke out just about that time and I suppose that in the general\nconfusion the matter was held up or overlooked till the news that Walter was\nsupposed to have been killed in 1915 put an end to it.",
    "However when it\nappeared likely that Walter had survived after all up it all came again.",
    "The\nAdmiral was very greatly distressed.",
    "This further scandal cropping up just when\nhis own old trouble seemed to have been forgotten soured his temper\ncompletely.\u201d\n\u201cI take it Admiral Penistone had rejoined the Navy during the War.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "He was a fine officer and they were glad to get him.",
    "He did good\nservice and finally retired for the second time at the end of the War with the rank\nof RearAdmiral.",
    "But if other people had forgotten his previous troubles he\nhadn\u2019t.",
    "They preyed on his mind and this business about Walter finished him\naltogether.",
    "One man who had been semiengaged to Elma withdrew rather\npointedly when he heard about the brother and Admiral Penistone said that he\nwould not have his niece subjected to insult.",
    "He packed up bag and baggage and\ntook her away with him to live in Cornwall.",
    "And there they stayed until a month\nago.",
    "All this happened in 1920.",
    "Nothing has been heard of Walter since.",
    "So you\n\n\fsee that the situation is rather a peculiar one.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Rudge thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cWalter seems to be awkwardly placed.",
    "If he\ncomes forward and shows himself he probably goes to penal servitude.",
    "If he\ndoesn\u2019t come forward he can\u2019t get his money.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the situation precisely.",
    "On the other hand if he is dead his share of\nthe money goes to Elma under his will of 1914.",
    "Provided of course that is that\nthe witness was correct in stating that he was actually still alive after his father\u2019s\ndeath.",
    "If not it still goes to her as residuary legatee under her father\u2019s will.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case Walter\u2019s death would be to his sister\u2019s financial advantage.",
    "I see.",
    "But now Mr. Dakers how do things stand with reference to Mrs. Holland\u2019s own\nshare of her father\u2019s money I presume that the Admiral being now dead the\nclause about the consent to the marriage becomes void.\u201d\n\u201cThat is exactly the difficulty\u201d replied Mr. Dakers uneasily.",
    "\u201cThe point of\nview taken by the Court in such cases is that the testator cannot have required\nthe beneficiary to perform impossibilities.",
    "Thus it has been held over and over\nagain that in the case of the condition becoming impossible of fulfilment\nthrough Act of God the gift remains.\u201d\n\u201cAct of God\u201d queried Rudge.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "In the case of consent being required to a marriage for instance if the\nperson whose consent is required dies before the marriage then the condition is\nimpossible of fulfilment and the gift stands.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so\u201d said Rudge \u201cbut what does Act of God mean precisely\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said the lawyer a little reluctantly Rudge thought \u201cthat means\u2014well\npractically speaking it means under conditions which the beneficiary could not\nhave prevented.\u201d\n\u201cLet us speak quite plainly\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cIf Elma Holland should be found to\nhave been concerned in Admiral Penistone\u2019s murder\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOf course in that case\u201d said Mr. Dakers \u201cthere would be no question of her\ninheriting.",
    "The law expressly forbids a criminal to profit by the fruits of the\ncrime.",
    "But surely that question does not arise.\u201d\n\u201cI should hope not\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cThen so far as I can see Mrs. Holland is\nnow entitled to her inheritance\u201d\n\u201cYees\u201d said the lawyer.",
    "\u201cI hope the Court will look upon it from that point of\nview.",
    "The difficulty lies in the extreme haste with which the marriage followed\nupon the death.",
    "I will be frank with you Mr. Rudge.",
    "I think it would be possible\nto contest the case and I think that if that occurred we should have to take one\nof two lines about it.",
    "We could of course say that she intended to ask the\nnecessary consent before the marriage and that but for the death she would\nhave had time to ask for it.",
    "Now of course she did ask for it\u2014several times.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWith any reasonable expectation of ever getting it\u201d asked Rudge.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Dakers\u201d he added as the lawyer appeared to hesitate \u201cI will go so far as to tell\nyou that I have witnesses here who are prepared to say that the Admiral appeared\nnot to approve of the marriage.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely\u201d said Mr. Dakers \u201cI must admit that there was\u2014an appearance at\nany rate of objection.",
    "And that being the case I do not quite know what the\nCourt would think of a marriage so hastily concluded.",
    "It might be inferred that\nthe Admiral was violently opposed to the marriage and that therefore the\nmarriage was undertaken with a definite intention of frustrating the object of the\ntestator.",
    "The indecent haste attending the ceremony affords you see in itself a\npresumption that the death of the Admiral removed the only obstacle to the\nmarriage.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that being so\u201d said Rudge \u201can allegation might be made that the\nAdmiral\u2019s death was not altogether\u2014shall we say by Act of God.\u201d\n\u201cIf such a monstrous allegation were made\u201d replied Mr. Dakers \u201cit would\nhave to be refuted in which case the mere fact that the hastiness of the marriage\nmight jeopardise the absolute right to the estate would constitute a very good\nanswer to the charge.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Rudge seizing on the weak point of the argument \u201cprovided the\nbeneficiary was aware how the law stood.\u201d He considered for a moment and\nthen said\n\u201cAnd your second line of defence would be\u201d\n\u201cTo show that the ceremony was not arranged until after death had made it\nimpossible to obtain consent.",
    "If it were so\u2014though I do not see how a licence\ncould have been taken out in the time\u2014it would be a complete answer to the\ncontesting party.",
    "It has frequently so been held.",
    "For instance in Collett v.\nCollett the mother whose consent was required died in 1856.",
    "In 1865 the\ndaughter married.",
    "The Master of the Rolls held that the gift over that is to the\nperson who was to get the money in case the condition was not fulfilled you\nunderstand will not take effect if the performance of the condition has become\nimpossible through the Act of God and no default of the person who had to\nperform it.\u201d Mr. Dakers reading these words from a notebook glanced over his\npincenez at Rudge who said nothing.",
    "He resumed.",
    "\u201c\u2018Here it is reasonably\ncertain that the mother if she had lived would have given her consent to this\nmarriage one eligible in all respects.\u2019 There you see Inspector is our difficulty.",
    "The Court seems to have based its decision to some extent on what the mother\nmight reasonably have been expected to do.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cAnd in this case the Admiral\u2019s consent could not very\nwell be presumed with any certainty.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThere again\u201d said the lawyer \u201cwho is to say If the eligibility of the\nmarriage as such is a factor to be taken into consideration there seems to be no\nreason why Admiral Penistone should not have consented.",
    "Holland so far as I\nknow anything about him seems to be a respectable man of suitable age and\nstanding and with sufficient money of his own to take him out of the class of\nmere fortunehunters.",
    "It is a very pretty case Mr. Rudge and if I were not\npersonally concerned it would give me great pleasure to see it thrashed out.\u201d\nRudge was about to reply when the sound of an approaching car was heard.",
    "A\nslight commotion followed at the front door.",
    "Voices and footsteps sounded and a\nminute after the study door was thrown open.",
    "\u201cInspector\u201d said Arthur Holland as he followed his wife into the room \u201cwe\nowe you an apology for running off like this but we were in a hurry and were\nafraid you might delay us.",
    "Is this Mr. Dakers How do you do sir My wife and\nI received your note and thought we had better come and set your mind at rest.\u201d\n\u201cThank you\u201d said Mr. Dakers rather dryly.",
    "\u201cWell Elma you have married in\nvery great haste.",
    "I trust you will not have to repent it at leisure.\u201d\nElma laughed.",
    "There was a faint flush of colour in her usually pale cheeks and\nshe looked Rudge thought rather a prey to some consuming excitement than\nradiant with the happiness of a newly married woman.",
    "\u201cYou have made a mistake Mr. Dakers\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI haven\u2019t jeopardised\nanything or compromised anything.",
    "Look at that.\u201d\nShe handed him a sheet of paper.",
    "Mr. Dakers settled his glasses more firmly\non his nose read it with a \u201cTuttut\u201d or two of astonishment and handed it over\nto Rudge.",
    "\u201cThat solves our problems I think Inspector.\u201d\nRudge looked at the paper.",
    "It was typewritten with the exception of the\nsignature and ran\u2014\n\u201cI willingly give my consent to the marriage of my niece Elma Mary\nFitzgerald with Arthur Holland.",
    "\u201cSigned H. L. PENISTONE.\u201d\nIt was dated the 9th August.",
    "Inspector Rudge looked at Holland.",
    "\u201cWhen did this come into your possession sir\u201d\n\u201cMy wife gave it to me this morning\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cShe had it last night from the\nAdmiral.\u201d\n\u201cAt what time was that ma\u2019am\u201d enquired the Inspector.",
    "\u201cJust after midnight\u201d replied the girl in a curious flat tone which reminded\n\n\fRudge of his interview with her earlier in the day.",
    "\u201cAfter midnight Did you see your uncle alive after midnight\u201d\n\u201cWhy of course\u201d interrupted Holland.",
    "\u201cI saw him myself.",
    "Yes I know\nInspector I didn\u2019t want to tell you about that because I was afraid you might\nstop us from going to town.",
    "But I\u2019ll come clean now.",
    "I saw the Admiral alive\nhere in his study at a quarter past twelve last night.\u201d\n\n\fCHAPTER VIII\nBy Ronald A. Knox\nTHIRTYNINE ARTICLES OF DOUBT\nnature of the case a policeman\u2019s life is bound up with surprises.",
    "A\nconsiderable part of the community is only too ready to set playful boobytraps\nfor him stretching wires across gardenpaths or waiting in dark alleys with half a\nbrick concealed in the foot of a stocking.",
    "Rudge had not risen to his\ninspectorship without some experiences of the kind and he had come near to\nachieving that unwondering attitude which is the old poet assures us part of the\nstuff of happiness.",
    "But this sudden admission almost caught him off his guard.",
    "Grice\u2019s statement that the body had been a corpse since some time before\nmidnight had seemed so evident a point of departure all the other features of the\ncase had grouped themselves round it so obligingly\u2014the possibility of a journey\ninto Whynmouth and foul play downstream the visit of the strange car the\ndarkness the loneliness the set of the tides.",
    "By the way why had he been so\ncertain about the tides Oh yes Neddy Ware odd that Neddy should have been\nso positive about it.",
    "Too late he realised that no single piece of evidence except\nthe misleading infallibility of the expert had excluded the possibility of a\nmurder well after midnight.",
    "And this it seemed now was what must have\nhappened.",
    "Of course Holland might be lying but it was difficult to see his\nmotive why abandon a firstclass alibi at the Lord Marshall for the honour of\nbeing the last man who saw deceased alive It would be a fool\u2019s game and\nHolland did not look like a fool.",
    "In a moment habit reasserted itself he had drawn out the inevitable notebook\nand was turning over the pages to a blank remembering not to moisten his finger\nas he did so.",
    "\u201cI think I ought to tell you sir\u201d he explained \u201cthat you are not\nbound to make any statement.",
    "You know well enough that you will have to be\ncalled at the inquest and if you prefer to reserve\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy defence\u201d interrupted Holland with heavy raillery.",
    "\u201cIt is too kind of you.",
    "But you see here I am all ready binged up with a cockandbull story carefully\nprepared to mislead you it would be a pity not to get it off my chest while I\u2019m\nwordperfect.",
    "You would like to get me in jug first wouldn\u2019t you and take down\nmy statement with no witnesses so that you could cook it afterwards I prefer\nthe present occasion if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nIN THE\n\n\fRudge just checked himself in time from reminding the unseasonable jester\nthat he wouldn\u2019t do himself any good by this kind of thing.",
    "After all Holland\nevidently belonged to the opulent classes who get the benefit of the doubt.",
    "\u201cCertainly sir\u201d he amended with some frigidity of manner.",
    "\u201cBut I think\nperhaps if Mrs. Holland\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you want to be certain that we both pitch the same yarn Well it\u2019s\nbad luck for a man on his honeymoon.",
    "But perhaps Elma if you wouldn\u2019t mind\n\u2014\u201d A rapid look passed between them on his side it registered adoring\nconfidence on hers was it a frown over his reckless demeanour Or was there\nnot after all a faint suspicion of disgust Mr. Dakers saved the situation by\nindicating that nothing would suit him better than a turn in the garden with\u2014in\nshort with Mrs. Holland there was much that needed discussion he felt.",
    "And\nRudge was left alone with his chief witness.",
    "\u201cNow sir\u201d he opened briskly \u201cwhen we last met you told a tale which was\nyou will admit in contradiction with what you said just now\u201d\n\u201cThese giant intellects Yes I told you I was in bed at Whynmouth.",
    "Actually I\nwas here.",
    "A discrepancy.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me sir but what I\u2019m getting at is this\u2014was it all untrue what you\ntold me For instance I have it down here that you were not seen by anybody\nafter eleven o\u2019clock.",
    "Do you still stick to that It doesn\u2019t seem quite so likely\ndoes it Perhaps you would try to remember anybody you passed on your way\nout here\u2014you will have walked I suppose Or did you come by the omnibus\u201d\n\u201cThe last \u2019bus my dear Rudge as you and I know very well leaves at halfpast ten.",
    "No I walked and I passed some of the gentlemen who had recently left\nthe Lord Marshall but they did not look as if they were likely to preserve a clear\nmemory of their impressions.",
    "There were some lovers about but I am afraid I\ncannot swear to their features and I doubt if they could to mine.",
    "I had no speech\nwith anybody.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t meet one of our men for example\u201d\nThere was a fraction of a pause almost as if a ready invention were suddenly\nat fault.",
    "\u201cNo I think not\u201d was the answer given.",
    "\u201cOnce I looked up a sidestreet and\nthought I saw a policeman\u2019s lantern being flashed but it might have been\nsomebody lighting a bicycle lamp.",
    "I can\u2019t remember which street it was now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you would be coming straight along the main road\u201d\n\u201cAll the way.\u201d\n\u201cNow then sir let\u2019s get at this if you don\u2019t mind.",
    "Were you meaning to pay\nthis rather late visit all the time Or were you delayed on the road Or did the\nidea just come to you suddenly when it was already closingtime or close on it\u201d\n\n\f\u201cMy dear Inspector you are a little elementary.",
    "I have no doubt the Boots told\nyou that he saw my shoes out in the passage.",
    "And therefore the story I have\ndecided to tell you is that I was already in process of going to bed when an\naccident made me alter my purpose.",
    "Looking out from my window I saw a man\nturning away from the front door whom I seemed to recognise by the set of his\nshoulders.",
    "Then I told myself I was a fool something about the hat convinced\nme that he was a clergyman.",
    "Then reflection told me that clergymen are not\nthrown out of pubs at closingtime.",
    "And I felt convinced I don\u2019t know how that\nit was poor old Penistone.",
    "I wanted to see him as you know I threw on the rest\nof my clothes hastily and went out into the street.",
    "There was no sign of him then\nof course but I hurried down the road I supposed he would be taking and in the\nend\u2014well in the end I came all the way here.\u201d\n\u201cOn the offchance of finding him still awake late at night like that\u201d\n\u201cInspector I do not know whether you are a married man or whether your\nbosom has always been impervious to the softer emotions.",
    "But if you will ask\nanyone who has been violently in love he will tell you that a lover thinks\nnothing of walking a mile or two merely to stand outside a window and\nsentimentalise among the rhododendrons.",
    "That is all I would have done if I had\nnot found the lights going strong in the poor old Admiral\u2019s study.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw them as you came along\u201d\n\u201cDo you know you would get much more information if you didn\u2019t try to\ncatch a fellow out all the time.",
    "Of course I didn\u2019t see them from the road.",
    "I had\ncome round into the lawn and saw them from there.",
    "I went up and knocked and\nthe Admiral let me in through the french window.",
    "He told me I had come just in\ntime \u2018quite dramatic\u2019 he said\u2014he was in the act of making out for his niece the\ndocument we had been waiting for these weeks past his consent to our marriage.",
    "And sure enough it was on the table when we came into the drawingroom.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be\u2014about a quarter past twelve you say\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice the time exactly.",
    "But I had started from the Lord Marshall\nsoon after eleven which is closingtime.",
    "I walked slowly after I had got out of\nWhynmouth so I can\u2019t have been here till twelve or so that\u2019s how I worked it\nout.\u201d\n\u201cYes I see.",
    "Now was it your impression that Admiral Penistone was just\nmeaning to turn in when you came Was he in his dressinggown for example\nWas he smoking or drinking a whisky and soda or anything You see what I\nmean sir\u2014I want to find out if he went outside after you had left and if so\nwhy.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t help you much there.",
    "He had a pipe in his mouth part of the\ntime to be sure.",
    "The only thing which made me feel he had not thought of bed\n\n\ftime yet was the litter on that desk papers lying there you know taken out of\ntheir pigeonholes.",
    "The Admiral wasn\u2019t the kind of man to go to bed without\nputting his papers to bed first.\u201d\n\u201cAh that\u2019s very interesting.",
    "And you haven\u2019t any idea I suppose what\npapers\u201d\n\u201cNot the least I\u2019m afraid.",
    "I dare say in your job you sometimes have to look\nover a man\u2019s shoulder to see what he is reading but we have a stricter code in\nthe jute trade.\u201d\nRudge felt the offensiveness of the reflection but he achieved a passable\nsmile.",
    "\u201cYou didn\u2019t stay long then Just thanked him maybe and said you\u2019d be\ngetting back to Whynmouth\u201d\n\u201cHardly more than that.",
    "He let me out at the french window again and I went\nback to the Lord Marshall in that frame of mind in which a man finds himself\nmy dear Inspector when he realises that the greatest dream of his life has come\ntrue.",
    "That is to say walking on air and not noticing much that went on round\nme.\u201d\n\u201cNot even how you unlocked the front door of the hotel\u201d\n\u201cWhy I am afraid I had taken my precautions about that.",
    "I knew that Boots is\nfond of going to bed as early as he can and does not like to have his sleep\ndisturbed.",
    "So I was careful to leave the backyard door on the latch\u2014you will\nfind that it has no bolts on it\u2014and Mrs. Davis I am afraid was none the wiser.",
    "I\nthought best not she talks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right there sir.",
    "All the same I wish you had been a little less quiet in\nyour comings and goings they\u2019ll put you through it properly at the inquest.",
    "But\nof course you\u2019d leave your boots outside the door so we\u2019ll have evidence that\nyou were in before the front door was opened\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Inspector you think of everything.",
    "You want me to say that I was\nwearing at a quarterpast eleven on the way to Rundel Croft the same pair of\nboots which were outside my door at halfpast.",
    "Believe me your technique is\nimproving.",
    "But the sad truth is that when I got up and followed my phantom\nAdmiral I put on another pair\u2014su\u00e8de shoes which one does not have cleaned\nif one is wise at the Lord Marshall.\u201d\n\u201cAh that explains it.",
    "I suppose you did not by any chance bring a copy of the\nEvening Gazette with you to Rundel Croft\u201d\n\u201cI never read it.",
    "Its politics nauseate me.\u201d\nRudge held his notebook at arm\u2019s length as if studying an artistic effect.",
    "\u201cWell that gives a clear account of your movements Mr. Holland.",
    "Now there\nare one or two questions I would like to ask but as they don\u2019t bear directly on\nwhat happened last night I shan\u2019t be surprised if you won\u2019t tell me.",
    "The first is\n\n\fjust this Why was it that Admiral Penistone at first didn\u2019t want to see you marry\nhis niece and then changed his mind\u201d\n\u201cI think you must be very busy looking for mysteries if you make a mystery\nout of that.",
    "If you come to think of it I have only known the family a matter of\nthree or four weeks.",
    "I first met my wife since you are kind enough to be so\ninterested in our private affairs at Sir Wilfrid Denny\u2019s just after she came here\nand it was love at first sight with both of us.",
    "The Admiral\u2014well he was a man\nof circumspection and he wanted to see more of me I suppose.",
    "When his niece\nwrote telling me to come down to Whynmouth again because she had good\nnews for me I only just dared to hope it was this.",
    "That was when I got the\nlicence.",
    "But it seems my respectability was more selfevident to him than it is to\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cOh come now no offence taken I hope.",
    "And then there\u2019s this second\nquestion which sounds impolite but I must ask it.",
    "Why were you in such a hurry\nto get married Mr. Holland\u201d\nHolland paused this time quite unmistakably but his face did not suggest guilt\nor duplicity he looked more like an honest man who knows more than he is at\nliberty to tell and is not quite sure how much he can tell without a breach of\ntrust.",
    "That at least is how Rudge read his expression for the moment or two\nwhile the embarrassment lasted.",
    "Then \u201cInspector\u201d said Holland with a more\nserious note in his voice \u201cyou mustn\u2019t ask me to be responsible for a woman\u2019s\nfancies.",
    "I know you think it was very shocking to go and get married like that\nvery quietly owing to mourning in the bride\u2019s family funeral bakemeats\nscarcely cold and so on.",
    "But well I think the truth is Elma is far more nervous\nthan her selfcommand lets you see.",
    "I think she was altogether rattled by what\nhappened here that night and she felt she was in danger here who could tell she\nwould not be the next victim of this mysterious vendetta or whatever it was\nShe wanted to get away from the place and she wanted to have a man close to\nher now that her uncle was gone who would have a natural right to be her\nprotector.",
    "There\u2019s that about me you see I may not be worthy of Elma but I\u2019ve\ngot the right format for a chuckerout.",
    "And I suppose that\u2019s how she looked at\nit.\u201d\n\u201cYes I see that.",
    "Now may I ask you this\u2014did Admiral Penistone himself\nwhen you last saw him give you any idea of what had made him change his\nmind Did he explain at all\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d known him you\u2019d know that he wasn\u2019t a man for explaining things.",
    "He was short and sharp in conversation\u2014hated to waste a word.",
    "And that night\nwhy he hardly said more than \u2018Good evening\u2019 and \u2018Come this way I\u2019ve\nsomething to show you\u2019 and \u2018There will that make you any happier\u2019\n\n\fOtherwise he just puffed at his pipe that was his idea of conversation.\u201d\n\u201cAh he was a great smoker was he Always the same pipe I\u2019ll be bound\nyour true smoker never uses more than one.\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t then.",
    "Why you can see for yourself how they\u2019re scattered over\nthe mantelpiece.",
    "If one wouldn\u2019t draw he\u2019d take to another.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder\u2014do you think it possible that he had anything on his mind and that\nwas why he said so little Of course I\u2019m anxious to find out whether the\nunfortunate gentleman knew at all what was coming to him.",
    "Did he look worried\nor tired for example when you saw him\u201d\n\u201cNot that I noticed.",
    "No not that I noticed.",
    "Of course when I saw him in the\nstudy the only lamp burning was that reading lamp just beside you which has a\nthick green shade over it as you see you don\u2019t see much of a man\u2019s face when\nhe is standing up and the light is all being thrown on his desk.",
    "But if you ask me\nwhether his tone of voice suggested excitement or worry I\u2019d say No.\u201d\n\u201cWell Mr. Holland I think I\u2019ve asked you all that I wanted.",
    "Oh except this\u2014\nhe wasn\u2019t wearing an overcoat was he by any chance\u201d\n\u201cIn his study On a hot summer night You might as well ask whether he was\nwearing chain armour.\u201d\n\u201cI know it sounds unlikely sir.",
    "But there it is\u2014he was in a greatcoat when he\nwas found.",
    "And of course \u2026 by the way Mr. Holland when you thought you\nsaw the Admiral outside your window would he be wearing a greatcoat then\u201d\n\u201cNow what a fool one is about noticing things I see him as in a greatcoat\nnow but then I know about the body \u2026 I feel as if he hadn\u2019t had a greatcoat on\nbut then I may be arguing with myself I may be saying to myself that I must\nhave noticed it if it had been worn on a hot night like that.",
    "If only my memory\nworked by eye No Inspector you may put me in jug but I should be\nmisleading you if I tried to give you a plain answer to a plain question.\u201d\n\u201cWell thank you for what you have told me sir.",
    "Now about Mrs. Holland\n\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIf you ask me I expect Mrs. Holland will want her dinner.",
    "It doesn\u2019t seem to\noccur to you that you\u2019re rather spoiling our honeymoon.",
    "Look here we\u2019ve\nbooked rooms at the Lord Marshall.",
    "Elma said she couldn\u2019t sleep in this house\njust yet.",
    "I don\u2019t dare to think what Mrs. Davis\u2019s dinner must be like when it gets\ncold.",
    "Can\u2019t you leave it till tomorrow and put my wife on the rack then\u201d\n\u201cWell sir it\u2019s like this.",
    "I\u2019ve got to see the coroner tomorrow morning and\nI\u2019ve got to give him as full an account of the case as I can and you and Mrs.\nHolland look at it whatever way you will are going to be important witnesses.",
    "But if you think Mrs. Holland would sooner see me first thing tomorrow why\nthere\u2019s a policeman on duty in the Square and if I may pass the word to him I\u2019ll\n\n\ffeel certain I know where to find you.",
    "Perhaps if I was to climb up behind you\nwouldn\u2019t mind giving me a lift as far as Whynmouth\u201d\n\u201cFor fear we might be tempted to take a wrong turning Well Inspector I\nsuppose we\u2019ve deserved that.",
    "All right come on we\u2019ll play fair this time.\u201d\nRudge sat in darkness at the back of the car instinctively spying on the two\nfigures whose outlines were blurred against the illuminated patch of road.",
    "The\nimpressions he had already formed of the couple were on the whole confirmed\nthere was little talk between them and when there was any the initiative seemed\nto come from Holland you saw in the attentive droop of his shoulder sideways\nthe model of the deferential lover whereas Elma looked straight in front of her\nand hardly moved when she answered.",
    "But then she was tired no doubt she had\nmuch to think of perhaps she even felt sorrow for the old man whose fortunes\nshe had shared for so many years now lying under that dustsheet in the\nmortuary.",
    "Rudge made an excuse to follow them into the hotel he was privately\nconcerned to make sure about the locking of that door into the backyard.",
    "The\nLord Marshall is an oldfashioned hotel and there is no private entrance for\nvisitors they have to pass along a narrow passage with a slight recess in the\nmiddle of it which gives you a back view of the gentlemen who are refreshing\nthemselves at the public bar.",
    "One of these made a halfturn as they entered and\nRudge had two simultaneous impressions\u2014that he recognised the man and that\nthe man did not want to be recognised.",
    "At least he shrank back as they\napproached and his face was hidden in the darkness of the space under the\nstairway.",
    "Returning from a mercifully brief interview with Mrs. Davis Rudge\nfound him again and verified his guess.",
    "It was Croppedhead the Gazette\nreporter.",
    "By a promise of seeing him next day Rudge managed to stave off his\neager questionings about the progress of the case.",
    "Then he had a word with the\npoliceman in the Square and went back to the seclusion of his own rooms.",
    "Inspector Rudge we must regretfully admit was a quite ordinary man.",
    "He did\nnot solace himself with the violin or the cocainebottle he did not tie knots in\nstring or collect scarabs or distinguish himself in any way by sidelines.",
    "The\nrooms to which he returned were quite ordinary rooms from which he had not\neven troubled to remove the landlady\u2019s decorations the whisky he took out of\nthe cupboard was so well known that the mention of its name would be an\nunnecessary advertisement the same may be said of the tobacco with which he\nfilled his pipe.",
    "If the full truth must be confessed Inspector Rudge was so far\nhuman that he took off his boots and replaced them with a pair of dressingslippers.",
    "Then he got down to the night\u2019s work and that consisted in selecting\nfrom the mass of material he had accumulated during the day the points that\n\n\fseemed most likely to repay investigation.",
    "These points he jotted down in the\nform of questions he added no written comment except an occasional\nmemorandum but as each question was reduced to verbal shape he looked up at\nthe ceiling and let his mind play around the possibilities which it suggested.",
    "The\nquestions are here reproduced with a summary of the cogitations to which each\none led.",
    "When he counted them up his orthodox mind was delighted to find\nthem exactly thirtynine in number.",
    "1.",
    "Why did Penistone come to Lingham and why did Sir Wilfrid mind\nAltogether there was too much of the China Station about this business.",
    "On the\nface of it there was nothing particularly improbable in the fact that two men\nwell acquainted with China should be living at such close range.",
    "But Mrs. Davis\nrepresenting the local gossip had seen some significance in it and quite\nunexpectedly she had volunteered the information that Sir Wilfrid did not seem\noverpleased at the neighbourhood.",
    "Was it conceivable that there had been a\nconnection between them in the past A guilty connection If so on which side\ndid the guilt lie On Sir Wilfrid\u2019s surely.",
    "Rudge\u2019s mind do what he would was\napt to travel in official grooves and the notion of blackmail forced itself on him.",
    "The more so because Sir Wilfrid appeared to be in straitened circumstances.",
    "Mem.\u2014Apply to the bank in the hope of getting the Admiral\u2019s passbook hardly\npossible to have the handling of Sir Wilfrid\u2019s.",
    "2.",
    "Why did Jennie think that Penistone and Elma seemed more like husband\nand wife than uncle and niece Probably mere gossip.",
    "Jennie had after all seen\nthe couple but a short time the fact that they managed the household\u2014\npresumably\u2014in financial partnership would give them to the girl\u2019s mind the air\nof equals.",
    "Once again Rudge\u2019s fancy toyed with the idea of an impersonation\nyet it seemed quite impossible that any such impersonation should long persist\nDakers would see through it if nobody else did.",
    "3.",
    "Why was Elma so familiar with the French maid And why did the French\nmaid leave so suddenly The two questions could be treated as one if there was\nany significance in the former it would probably provide an explanation for the\nother.",
    "The allegation that C\u00e9lie had found the place dull was surely a mere\nexcuse a Frenchwoman who had stood years of Cornish exile would necessarily\ntake more than a week to grow tired of Lingham Whynmouth after all boasted\na picturepalace.",
    "It might of course be some romance or tragedy below stairs\nwhich happened to have come to a head at the moment.",
    "But it seemed more\nnatural to assume that the move was the cause of the flight\u2014yes you might\nalmost call it a flight since there was money owing.",
    "Of course if C\u00e9lie were not\n\n\fa mere servant it might be that money was no object to her.",
    "But why leave just\nafter a move Surely it would have been more plausible to give notice when the\nmove took effect.",
    "And that meant\u2014that ought to mean that C\u00e9lie on coming to\nLingham had found something there which was unexpectedly disconcerting to\nher or that circumstances arose at Lingham which would not have arisen in\nCornwall.",
    "Too short a time for romance.",
    "Had C\u00e9lie been in Lingham before\nMem.\u2014Trace if possible C\u00e9lie\u2019s present whereabouts and past references.",
    "4.",
    "Why again on Jennie\u2019s testimony was so little love lost between Elma and\nHolland on her side at any rate Once more it might be mere gossip.",
    "Who was\nit who was credited with a \u201cmiserably low standard of intoxication\u201d Perhaps\nJennie had an unusually high standard of walkingout.",
    "Jennie peered at you and\na couple of shy lovers might have been at pains to disengage their hands at the\nwarning of her heavyfooted entrance.",
    "But if there was anything to it it\nsuggested that the marriage on one side at least was a mariage de convenance.",
    "On which side Hers according to the evidence and to be sure she had had an\nearlier disappointment her youth was slipping from her.",
    "It might be too that\nshe was anxious to deal with her capital instead of having the interest doled out\nto her by trustees.",
    "But where was the need here She lived simply she dressed\ndowdily.",
    "Holland of course might be an adventurer but if so he was a clever\nfeigner of love.",
    "5.",
    "What did Elma do with her money This question arose naturally out of the\nlast.",
    "How simple life would be for the police if we all audited our accounts like\nthe public charities Rundel Croft was not a house of pretensions its grounds\nwere negligible.",
    "Even if Elma paid more than a halfshare\u2014and the Admiral\nmust have had some money\u2014it was hard to believe that \u00a31200 a year could be\nneeded for upkeep.",
    "Yet the capital was hers there was no obvious need of\nsaving.",
    "Once again the word blackmail suggested itself but this time it seemed\nto be the wrong way about.",
    "If Sir Wilfrid were the blackmailer why did his\nvictims settle so close And why did he manifest annoyance Mem.\u2014Once\nmore consult the Admiral\u2019s passbook.",
    "6.",
    "What part did Walter play in the background of these lives If he was dead\nthen his influence only persisted in so far as he was keeping Elma out of half of\nher inheritance and this in view of her already comfortable circumstances\nseemed a factor that could be neglected.",
    "But if he were alive\u2014what would be his\ninfluence then Was he popular with his family or had the story of his disgrace\nobliterated all affection It was odd when you came to think of it that a\nhousehold so connected with a soldier who disappeared in the War should have\nno photograph of him exposed in study or drawingroom.",
    "And yet\u2014there was\nthe scandal of the cheque awkward perhaps to have visitors saying \u201cWho\u2019s\n\n\fthat\u201d If he were alive what was he doing what would he be doing It seemed\nunlikely that a man of his antecedents would let a fortune pass him by without a\nstruggle.",
    "Yet granted he were alive and were attempting to reinstate himself\nwhat could he stand to gain by committing a crime of this sort or inducing\nothers to commit it \u201cPoint is disappearance of valuable uncle\u201d Rudge found\nhimself quoting.",
    "The corpse of one trustee does not make a legacy.",
    "7.",
    "Why did Ware think the Admiral had altered since he last saw him People\ndo change their looks of course and a man labouring under a long grievance\nmay be excused for losing something of his old cheerfulness and vitality.",
    "But the\nphotographs at Rundel Croft evidently dating back to the period of Ware\u2019s\nreminiscences bore a quite unmistakable resemblance to the man found\ndrowned.",
    "Again the wild suggestion of an impersonation flooded across the\nInspector\u2019s mind again common sense told him that a longsustained\nimpersonation is a practical impossibility.",
    "Was it conceivable that Ware did\nrecognise the corpse he fished out then for some reason pretended not to then\nby way of explaining his lapse of memory invented this story of altered looks\nBut again why should Ware pretend ignorance Why not have said \u201cI\u2019ve seen\nthe man before somewhere but I can\u2019t remember the circumstances\u201d Mem\u2014\nAsk Dakers about this.",
    "8.",
    "Does Mrs. Davis\u2019s allusion to a runaway wife at the Vicarage lead\nanywhere It seemed a long shot but so far apart from Elma there was no\nwoman in the case except the woman in the car untraced and this phantom from\nLingham\u2019s past who might surely be expected to give the place a wide berth.",
    "It\nhas been suggested that Rudge\u2019s mind ran obstinately in grooves of police\nexperience and cherchez la femme is almost the first item in the policeman\u2019s\ndecalogue.",
    "But how to make enquiries about Mrs. Mount\u2019s history since her\nelopement The Vicar could supply the name of his guilty rival but it would be\nbrutality to ask him and even so the traces of a tenyearsold disappearance\nwould almost certainly have been obliterated by now.",
    "No Rudge decided he\nwas becoming fantastic.",

    "There was not even a loose thread to be picked up here.",
    "Rudge drew a line across this page.",
    "So far his questions were all questions\nwhich might have been asked though there would have been no reason for the\npolice to ask them yesterday afternoon when the river ran peacefully between\nthe Vicarage and Rundel Croft the two boys sporting in it with no shadow of a\ntragedy to overawe their high spirits when the Admiral\u2019s brisk walk and sharp\nvoice proclaimed him very much alive and no pale corpse rested in the\nWhynmouth mortuary.",
    "Now he must get on to the crime itself its circumstances\n\n\fand the traces it had left.",
    "He hitched his chair up a little closer to the table took a\nmeditative pull out of his glass emptied out and refilled his pipe then returned\nmethodically to his selfimposed catechism.",
    "9.",
    "Why did Elma dress up that night to meet the Vicar Here again you were\ndealing with impressions the impressions of a rather fanciful servantgirl.",
    "But\none must not despise the testimony of the expert and a lady\u2019s maid in the little\nworld of her own limited interests is an observant critic.",
    "Any deviation from the\nnormal however slight is worth watching as a possible hint that crime did not\ncome altogether like a bolt from the blue that somebody was up to something\nbeforehand.",
    "But in this case who was up to what If Elma thought she was going\nto meet Holland that night odd that it should have been her uncle not she who\nwas in a hurry to get back to Rundel Croft.",
    "And if a meeting was projected it\nwas evidently a secret one no need then to draw attention to it by tricking\nherself out for the occasion.",
    "On the other hand Mr. Mount seemed hardly the\nman to appreciate a lady\u2019s costume hardly the man whom the most enterprising\nof adventuresses would have set out to vamp.",

    "Was it conceivable that Elma was up to some game which\ninvolved leaving Rundel Croft later that night that she meant to change her\nclothes for the purpose and was at pains to put on elaborate evening dress so as\nto make the later change a more effective disguise Mem.\u2014Ask Jennie if any\nother wardrobe items showed signs of disturbance or hasty folding this morning.",
    "10.",
    "Why did she hide the dress afterwards At least that was going a little too\nfast.",
    "But she had certainly made a point of packing the dress and of packing it\nherself.",
    "The conclusion though not irresistible was certainly probable that there\nwas something about that dress which she did not want even a confidential eye\nto discover.",
    "But that meant unless she was going to tell a quite different story\nunder tomorrow\u2019s crossexamination that Elma had something to conceal and\nwas giving a false account of her movements.",
    "If after leaving the boathouse\nshe went straight to bed it was impossible that any telltale evidence\u2014a split or a\nstain\u2014should have made its appearance since her good night to the Admiral.",
    "The trouble was that since Elma had moved to the Lord Marshall Jennie was no\nlonger in a position to report.",
    "Mem.\u2014If there is a chambermaid at the inn who\ndoesn\u2019t talk ask her to find out whether that dress ever came back from London.",
    "11.",
    "Was it Penistone who went down to Whynmouth that night The evidence\ncame from two sources both were uncertain one quite possibly mendacious.",
    "Rudge had satisfied himself that the lighting outside the Lord Marshall was\nparticularly inadequate.",
    "The direct statement made to the Boots who could\nhardly be lying showed that the man who called at the door was either the\nAdmiral or an impostor who was impersonating him.",
    "If Holland\u2019s account were\n\n\ftrue it confirmed the notion that some deliberate attempt had been made at\ndisguise Holland did not overhear the visitor\u2019s conversation and yet thought\nthere was a look of the Admiral about him.",
    "But then was Holland telling the\ntruth Assume that it was the Admiral why did he suddenly want to take that\nlate and bad train up to London In the alternative why did he want to create\nthe impression that he had intended doing so Either supposition implied that\nthere was some mysterious dealing on the Admiral\u2019s own part which no other\nevidence except perhaps his impatience to get away from the Vicarage\nsuggested.",
    "Assume that it was not the Admiral then what was the point of this\nelaborate frameup To implicate Holland in the crime But there was no\nforetelling that Holland would not remain fast asleep at the Lord Marshall\nnothing but his own evidence served to connect him with the mysterious caller.",
    "To deceive the public about the spot at which the murder was committed Yes\nthere was something in that it might help out an alibi.",
    "But would not the bogus\nAdmiral have been at pains to leave other evidence of his visit besides that of a\nsleepy and stupid hotel servant\n12.",
    "If it was the Admiral did he travel by road or by river According to the\nVicar\u2019s evidence which must be genuine since it could be checked the Admiral\nhad a game leg and did not walk if he could help it.",
    "It seemed unlikely that he\ncould have taken out the car without waking some of the household.",
    "The boat\nremained as a possibility and if the Admiral went secretly down the river in a\nboat where was he going to put it when he took the London train Abandoned it\nwould invite theft moored among other boats it would bear testimony to his\nmovements.",
    "It was hardly to be supposed that he meant to leave Whynmouth for\never.",
    "The suggestion seemed to be that all this talk about the train was a blind.",
    "Once again for what purpose The only thing which seemed certain was that the\nAdmiral\u2019s boat had been taken from its moorings that night and had been\nrestored to the boathouse by somebody who was not the Admiral.",
    "13.",
    "Why did the visitor whoever it was ask for Holland and then refuse to see\nhim If it was a bogus Admiral the answer was not in doubt the man had asked\nfor Holland so as to get an excuse for mentioning the Admiral\u2019s name possibly\nalso to implicate Holland in the trouble which was to follow.",
    "He did not actually\nmeet Holland for fear of detection.",
    "If it was the real Admiral a motive was\nharder to assign.",
    "His behaviour seemed that of a man who wants to make sure\nthat a hotel guest has really arrived or that he is really in the hotel and yet does\nnot trouble to conceal those inquisitorial methods from the person against whom\nthey are directed.",
    "If Holland\u2019s story were true the Admiral might have\ncontemplated a real visit so as to reassure him about the consent.",
    "But why after\ntaking so much trouble should he go away without leaving any significant\n\n\fmessage\n14.",
    "Did Holland really see anybody in the street Answer Yes and it means\nthat Holland\u2019s story is true up to a point he really was in the Lord Marshall or\nnear it as late as closing time.",
    "But there was that hesitation about the greatcoat\nwas that genuine Or was the ignorance affected to avoid possible traps\nAnswer No and it means that Holland still possesses knowledge which he is\nconcealing.",
    "Either he knew that the Admiral intended to make that visit or he\nwas privy to the plans of the fellow who impersonated the Admiral.",
    "In either\ncase his mention of the visitor would be an attempt to prove that he was really\nin the hotel at closing time this smelt of an alibi.",
    "15.",
    "Did Holland really go to Rundel Croft that night Against the story was\nits extreme vagueness the absence of clear motive the care he took to explain\nwhy no witnesses of his journey were likely to be forthcoming his selection of a\nfresh pair of shoes the alleged secrecy of his exits and entrances.",
    "On the other\nhand if Holland was lying it was hard to suppose that he was lying to screen\nhimself bed was his best alibi.",
    "The evidence of the Boots and Mrs. Davis would\nbe a difficult defence for the police to get over without some positive clue to\nimplicate Holland\u2014and no such clue existed.",
    "Instead of sticking to his first\nstory that he had slept soundly in his bed he had gone out of his way to confess\nhimself a liar had told a story fantastic in many points about a visit to Rundel\nCroft which no witness could attest and in doing so had deliberately claimed the\nposition of the last man who had seen Penistone alive.",
    "He seemed to be running\nhis head deliberately into a noose why should he do that unless to divert\nsuspicion from the real criminal And that meant \u2026 yes it would hang together.",
    "He had told the truth this morning since then fresh knowledge had come to him\nwhich induced him to put a halter round his own neck.",
    "But then was Holland\nlying Would he not by now have contrived to make up a more plausible story\naccounting for his presence at Rundel Croft\n16.",
    "If he went did he go by appointment Such an appointment might have\nbeen made either with the Admiral himself or more probably with Elma.",
    "If the\nformer were true nothing could bring the charge home except some record of a\nmessage if it was brought by note somebody had brought the note if it was sent\nby telephone the call could probably be traced.",
    "Also to be sure a message sent\nby telephone to an hotel meant that the receiver would be lifted off by an hotel\nservant and the circumstance at that hour of the night would probably be\nremembered.",
    "When you came to think of it the message if there was one must\nhave come from Elma or Holland must have supposed that it came from Elma.",
    "Otherwise he would have had no reason to conceal it and he could have made\nhis own story much more plausible by admitting it.",
    "Mem.\u2014See Mrs. Davis about\n\n\fthe message enquire if necessary at the telephone exchange.",
    "17. Who was the woman who went through Lingham at a quarter to eleven\nAt least that was really the wrong way to put it you could hardly hope to know\nwho she was at this stage.",
    "But it was worth considering whether her arrival\ncould have had any influence on the situation.",
    "Her car which might or might not\nhave contained another occupant would reach Whynmouth in time to deposit the\nmysterious visitor at the Lord Marshall.",
    "Alternatively it would have been\npossible for the occupants of such a car to be at Rundel Croft in time for the\nmurder even if you dated the murder early.",
    "They might have gone round by\nFernton Bridge the enquiry for the Vicarage being merely a blind or they might\nhave stopped close to the Vicarage and ferried themselves across by making\nfree with Mr. Mount\u2019s boat.",
    "This last plan would have the effect of bringing the\nVicarage boat on to the scene of action a point deserving to be considered from\nthe detective\u2019s point of view.",
    "But Rudge found himself instinctively recoiling\nfrom such an explanation.",
    "For it would mean that the criminal or criminals came\nand went by car their base presumably London.",
    "It was not possible for the\nWhynmouth police to search for suspicious characters in London Scotland Yard\nmight have to be invoked and that always meant that the credit went to Scotland\nYard.",
    "At this point the Inspector drew a fresh line across his page.",
    "He had reached\nthe end of the enquiries which were antecedent or seemed at first sight\nantecedent to the murder itself.",
    "It was time now to come on to a fresh set of\nproblems those created by the circumstances in which the corpse was\ndiscovered.",
    "The pipe needed to be relit and for that matter another tot seemed\nindicated the indication was allowed to have full weight.",
    "Now for the facts.",
    "Human testimony was a slippery and uncertain thing to deal with what you were\ntold was a photograph fogged as it were by the shadow of the man who told it\nyou.",
    "But Nature did not lie tides ran dew formed blood flowed doors opened\nand shut on uniform and ascertainable principles.",
    "The clues pointed you on to\nthe actions which had produced them and then hinted entrancingly at the\nmotives which lay behind the actions.",
    "Well then \u2026\n18.",
    "Here is a man murdered who had a motive and what motive for\nmurdering him Ordinarily one would expect a local quarrel though the knife\nas Mrs. Davis acutely noticed is not the English criminal\u2019s weapon.",
    "But a\nmonth\u2019s residence hardly gave time for any supposition of the kind here.",
    "A\nCornish enemy would have found it difficult to track his man down would have\ndelayed longer to ascertain the lie of the land.",
    "The quarrel then which found its\nsatisfaction in that grisly wound must be a quarrel dating from past history in\nthe Admiral\u2019s life.",
    "Further you could assume with some certainty that the\n\n\fmurderer either knew the habits or possessed the confidence of his victim.",
    "A\nman is found murdered in the Vicar\u2019s boat on the very night when he has been\ndining at the Vicarage in his pocket is a copy of that very newspaper to which\nhe is in fact a subscriber the murder is somehow connected with a visit alleged\nor real to a neighbouring hotel where an acquaintance of the victim is in fact\nstaying.",
    "All this betrays a knowledge of relevant circumstances the mysterious\nChinaman of the storybooks can be ruled out of the list of suspects he would\nnot have committed the murder just so.",
    "That narrowed down the search to people\nwho knew something about the Admiral.",
    "Who did His neighbours Neddy Ware\nnot much the Vicar the Vicar\u2019s sons Sir Wilfrid Denny still an unknown\nquantity.",
    "His servants but they had given so far no ground for suspicion.",
    "His\nfamily and those concerned with its fortunes Elma the problematical Walter\nHolland Mr. Dakers.",
    "Of these which had a motive\u2014a strong one Elma had a\nweak one the desire to get her money absolutely.",
    "Holland had a stronger one to\novercome an obstacle to his marriage but was it strong enough Not unless and\nuntil it could be proved that the typewritten consent was a forgery.",
    "Mr. Dakers\nhardly came into the picture at all Walter if he was alive was a tough customer\nno doubt but how exactly did he stand to gain by his uncle\u2019s disappearance\nThis absence of motive was a puzzling feature was it possible that some guest of\nSir Wilfrid Denny\u2019s was implicated Mem.\u2014Trace Denny as soon as possible.",
    "19.",
    "Why was a knife chosen as the weapon Stabbing usually meant murder in\nhot blood or as the result of panic a thoughtout crime would ordinarily depend\non safer weapons.",
    "Its use suggested that the murder took place at some spot\nwhere the report of firearms would have been heard and would have brought\nrescue near the house for instance.",
    "Grice had been away all day and had as yet\nmade no investigation of the wound since the loss of the Norwegian knife had\nbeen discovered.",
    "If that knife seemed likely to be the weapon it would look as if\nthe criminal\u2019s first plans had not involved murder or at least murder done in\nthat way.",
    "20.",
    "Why was the body found in a boat No use to suggest that the murder had\nbeen done in the boat and the body from fear or disgust left where it lay.",
    "In the\nfirst place it is very hard to murder a man in a boat you must be in it yourself\nand that means looking at one another all the time\u2014no chance for a sudden\nattack.",
    "And in this case the blood must have flowed yet there were no marks on\nthe white paint.",
    "The body then had been deliberately put into the boat why\nFor convenience of colportage That was possible but granted that your corpse\nhas got to make a journey by boat it does not follow that it is best left there.",
    "Suppose it had been thrown overboard with a couple of stones tied to it The\nAdmiral\u2019s disappearance would have caused alarm at first but a report from the\n\n\fLord Marshall that he had been seen in Whynmouth that night just en route for\nthe late train would have dissipated the rumour of murder until the river gave up\nits dead and by that time the murderer might be anywhere\u2014China for example.",
    "The murderer\u2019s instinct is always to hide his victim at least for the moment this\nmurderer had deliberately put the corpse on show with the certainty of its\ndiscovery next morning.",
    "What did that mean It suggested at least that the\nwhole circumstances in which the corpse was found were a deliberate frameup\nthe criminal felt certain that suspicion would not fall on him so long as he left\nevidence which would fasten the suspicion on other people.",
    "Granted that frame\nof mind you could just account for the boat.",
    "A boat travels with the stream or\nwith the tide at a more or less uniform pace a floating body by itself might get\nheld up by any overhanging branch any patch of shallows.",
    "It might be that the\ncriminal wanted to suggest by the position in which the body was found that the\nmurder had taken place at a different hour or at a different spot from the actual\nhour the actual spot.",
    "Best to ask Neddy Ware to say exactly what combinations\nof times and places would have brought the boat to the spot at which he found it\ne.g.",
    "Whynmouth Fernton Bridge the Vicarage as alternative sites 10.30\n11.30 12.30 as alternative times.",
    "Mem.\u2014Look up Neddy Ware again.",
    "21.",
    "Why was the body found in that particular boat An easy answer\nsuggested itself \u201cTo throw suspicion on the Vicar\u201d for which reason too the hat\nwas doubtless thrown in.",
    "To suppose that the Vicar if he were really privy to the\nmurder would allow his connection with it to be thus blatantly advertised was\nridiculous.",
    "But then was it not almost equally ridiculous to suppose that the\ncriminal had chosen the Vicar as his scapegoat The frameup in that case was\ninconceivably clumsy work.",
    "The simple bluff of pretending that the Vicar was\nthe criminal seemed too simple the double bluff of pretending to have pretended\nthat the Vicar was the criminal seemed too complicated.",
    "Yet for what other\npurpose could the Vicarage boat have been dragged into the story at all It might\nindicate that the murderer had started from the other side of the river and had\nfound that a borrowed boat saved the trouble of going round by the bridge.",
    "On\nthe other hand it might indicate that the murderer had wanted the police to think\njust that having in fact started his operations from the Rundel Croft bank.",
    "There\nwas not much to be made of this clue and yet it haunted the imagination.",
    "22.",
    "Why was the Vicar\u2019s hat left behind Assuming for the moment that\nMount was the criminal the question admitted of no ready answer.",
    "On the\nwhole people are hatwearers or bareheaders the former class will notice the\nabsence of the familiar feeling as a kind of discomfort.",
    "You would expect the\nmurderer passing his hand over his forehead to cry out instinctively \u201cGood\nheavens where is my hat\u201d An unconscious exchange of hats between the\n\n\fmurderer and his victim seemed just possible Holland had fancied a clerical\nappearance about the hat which the Admiral if it was the Admiral had worn that\nnight.",
    "Again assuming that the murderer came from the direction of the\nVicarage it was possible that he had found the hat lying derelict in the summerhouse and had borrowed it for his own purpose\u2014to hide his face for example.",
    "Mem.\u2014Examine the hat on the offchance of finding lay hairs adhering to it.",
    "23.",
    "Why was the key to the french window found in the bottom of the\nAdmiral\u2019s boat This key business was less puzzling.",
    "Presumably when Elma\nleft her uncle to lock up the boat she took the key up with her and left it in the\nfrench window on the outside so that he could let himself in later.",
    "Did he so let\nhimself in It looked as if he must have to find his greatcoat.",
    "Then if he ever\nwent out again alive he would lock the window from the outside and slip the\nkey into his pocket.",
    "It might fall out of his pocket easily enough when his dead\nbody was put into the boat.",
    "Alternatively if the Admiral was in fact killed in his\ngarden before he had time to reenter the house the criminal would no doubt use\nthe key to let himself in when he was in search of the hidden papers.",
    "Once he\nhad got those papers and the Admiral was dead it did not matter what he did\nwith the key indeed it was necessary to get rid of it somehow.",
    "24.",
    "Why was the Admiral\u2019s boat moored contrary to custom by the bows\nHere was a point of genuine significance.",
    "It meant that this boat too had figured\nsomehow in the movements of that August night.",
    "Either the Admiral had been\nabroad on her and had been caught in the middle of his travels or else the\ncriminal having despatched him in his own garden had made use of two boats\nin disposing of the body or possibly in securing his own escape.",
    "And for some\nreason a baffling one surely he had thought it more important to leave the\nAdmiral\u2019s boat moored than the Vicar\u2019s.",
    "Inexplicably he must have thought that\nthings looked more natural this way.",
    "Another pertinent consideration arose\nElma must surely have known her uncle\u2019s little fad about the mooring of boats\nand therefore if she or anybody acting under her immediate direction had been\nguilty of the murder it was hard to believe that the boat would not have been\nfound in the morning moored as usual.",
    "25.",
    "Why is a whole length of the painter missing And such a small length not\nas much as you would naturally cut off if you needed the rope for some unusual\npurpose to tie a man\u2019s hands for example.",
    "No the Vicar\u2019s boat had first been\ncut loose from its moorings and then it had been tied up again either to some\nother post or to some other boat and once more it had been necessary to cut it\nwith a knife instead of untying it.",
    "This was puzzling because ordinarily what\nman has done man can undo if it is the same man.",
    "You had to allow for\naccident e.g.",
    "two ropes might have been tied together and then swelled through\n\n\fbeing left in the water or some sudden need for haste might have arisen so that\nthere was no leisure for untying knots.",
    "But following out the indications of the\npainter for what they were worth you were led to the conclusion that the painter\nhad been twice cut that a different person had been responsible for the second\ncut and that this new person was shorter than the other.",
    "The Vicar for example\nwho was tallish might have cut the rope in the first instance but if it was he who\nretied the boat he would naturally do so at a height which would make it\npossible for him to untie it again without difficulty.",
    "This new figure in the story\nmight be called xn the original painter cutter being labelled x.",
    "Now it was\npossible that xn was simply the Admiral.",
    "But the question arose whether you\nhad not to allow for two people besides the Admiral both concerned in the\ndoings of that night x and xn.",
    "Holland might be x but such was his height that\nhe might have been expected to untie the boat even from its first moorings.",
    "26.",
    "Why was the body found in a coat It was a pity when you came to think\nof it that that question had not been put down immediately after No.",
    "20.",
    "It\nwould have been a rhyme.",
    "Rudge in his youth had tried to fill up the last lines\nof limericks but he had never claimed to be a poet and it was a new experience\nfor him to find himself in the position of the young Ovid writing verse\nunconsciously.",
    "Yes to be sure that greatcoat.",
    "If the Admiral really went into\nWhynmouth and really meant to catch the late train it was conceivable that he\nwould have taken a coat with him to protect him against the chill of the early\nmorning.",
    "But Rudge was altogether inclined to discredit that projected railway\njourney.",
    "If the Admiral really went to Whynmouth or to any other point along\nthe river in a boat and with the intention of returning in a boat he would only\nhave encumbered himself with a fairly substantial overcoat for one reason\u2014he\nmust have anticipated having to hang about somewhere waiting for somebody\ntalking to somebody in the open air and was afraid that he would get a chill\nafter taking exercise without this precaution.",
    "On the other hand the greatcoat\nwas a loose one what they call in the shops \u201csomething in the style of a\nRaglan.\u201d It would have been quite possible then for the murderer unless he\nwere squeamish about handling corpses to pull the overcoat on to a dead body\nin a perfectly convincing way.",
    "Now what would that mean Probably that the\nmurderer was elaborating a \u201cframeup\u201d as before having disseminated the idea\nthat the Admiral meant to go up to London by the late train he went on to give\nthat idea corroboration by vesting his victim suitably for such a journey.",
    "27.",
    "And now why the newspaper in the pocket If the Admiral had really\nintended a train journey and had gone into the house to get his coat with that in\nview was it not humanly certain that his eye would have fallen on the\nnewspaper close by and that he would have crammed the familiar copy in his\n\n\fgreatcoat there and then The trainservice from Whynmouth to London is not\ndistinguished for speed and most residents arm themselves with some kind of\nliterature before they set out on it.",
    "But this the Admiral had not done the second\ncopy found in the hall the morning after the murder was the genuine article for it\nwas marked \u201cAdmiral Pennystone\u201d with one of Mr. Tolwhistle\u2019s characteristic\nmisspellings.",
    "Where did the unmarked copy come from The shops and the\nbookstalls at Whynmouth were all shut by nine and there were no longer any\nstreet vendors\u2014Whynmouth is a sleepy place and the last optimist who had\ntried peddling alleged \u201clate editions\u201d had gone out of business some months\nearlier.",
    "The Admiral had not gone into the Lord Marshall could not then have\npicked up a copy there and walked off with it.",
    "If he was really in possession of it\nwhile still alive it followed that he must have called somewhere else that night.",
    "Sir Wilfrid Denny\u2019s house suggested itself as a possibility.",
    "If on the other hand\nthe paper had been thrust into the pocket after his death by the man who\nmurdered him that could only have been done with the intention of falsifying\nthe evidence.",
    "Falsifying it how In point of time by suggesting that the murder\ntook place say after nine instead of having taken place before nine But that\nwould bring the real time to an impossibly early hour.",
    "In point of place then the\nmurder really happened in some place at a distance from Whynmouth and the\nmurderer by thrusting the Gazette into the dead man\u2019s pocket had tried to create\nthe impression that the murder took place at Whynmouth or at least while the\nvictim was on his way back from there.",
    "Read so this piece of evidence chimed\nin with the conclusion which had already suggested itself\u2014that the murderer\nwanted it to be thought falsely that the Admiral was in Whynmouth that\nevening.",
    "If you accepted this argument a further consideration arose.",
    "The\nmurderer was somebody who did not know Whynmouth or whose knowledge of\nit was not uptodate.",
    "A resident\u2014the elusive Sir Wilfrid for example\u2014would\nnot have made the mistake of imagining that the Gazette was still on sale at\neleven o\u2019clock in the evening.",
    "28.",
    "Of what nature were the documents marked \u201cX\u201d That they were secret\nthat they were valuable went without saying.",
    "What was much more remarkable\nif you came to think of it was that any reference to \u201cX\u201d should have been given\namong the files at all.",
    "The Admiral himself though he was one of the few\nadmirals who had not publicly attested his indebtedness to any system of\nmemorytraining was clearly not absentminded beyond the average of\nhumanity why then should he need a reference to remind him where these allimportant documents were kept Yet if the references were not for the\nAdmiral\u2019s own benefit who else could profit by them In the event of his desk\nbeing broken open would it not have been safer to leave the very existence of\n\n\f\u201cX\u201d as well as its whereabouts a secret It looked almost as if the Admiral had\nexpected the fate which ultimately came upon him\u2014after all there was that\nloaded revolver in the desk\u2014expected that a police officer sooner or later would\nrummage in his desk and would need a pointer to inform him that secret papers\nwere concealed somewhere.",
    "It would appear that Sir Wilfrid was somewhat\ninvolved also the nephew Walter.",
    "It seemed probable that the background was\nChinese.",
    "Was it blackmail If so Sir Wilfrid must surely be the victim of it not\nWalter you cannot threaten with exposure a man who has disappeared from\nhuman ken.",
    "29.",
    "Were they destroyed or stolen And by whom It was just possible that\nPenistone at some time had got rid of documents which would be damaging to\nhimself or to someone he cared for.",
    "It was more natural to assume that the\nmurderer was also a thief.",
    "But\u2014here was an important point\u2014the person who\nstole those papers must almost necessarily have been an inmate of the house\nthe desk had shown no traces of being rifled there were no marks of violence\nabout the secret drawer.",
    "If then the villain of last night had removed those\npapers he had known exactly where to look for them and had wasted no time\nover it.",
    "Whew There was a fresh section of the evidence concluded that finished the\nclues which dated from last night.",
    "Rudge\u2019s left foot had gone to sleep and he\ntramped his room for a bit trying to map out what remained of his task.",
    "Yes he\nmust analyse the behaviour of the various people against whom suspicion might\nconceivably lie since the actual discovery of the corpse.",
    "The most noticeable\nfeature undoubtedly was what you might call the drain of the rural population\n\u2014the general dash for London.",
    "Very well then\n30.",
    "Why did Elma Fitzgerald hurry up to London The conclusion seemed\ninevitable that her flight was consequent upon the news of the murder.",
    "She was\nnot fond of early rising and her early rising that morning had been Rudge\u2019s own\nfault.",
    "The Whynmouth line assumes like most railways that you do not want to\ntravel up to the metropolis much after ten o\u2019clock after that hour the speed of\nthe trains sagged noticeably and day tickets were no longer available.",
    "Consequently if you were going up to London you prepared for an early start.",
    "Elma had made an early start but she had not prepared for it.",
    "She had not fled to\nmeet Holland for she knew unless his overnight message had remained\nundelivered that he was in Whynmouth.",
    "She had not been to see Mr. Dakers\u2014\nthough of course Holland\u2019s pursuit might have interrupted that plan.",
    "Better wait\nto hear what she will say tomorrow.",
    "31.",
    "Why did Holland ditto This was plainer sailing.",
    "Innocent or guilty and\nwhether he believed her to be innocent or guilty he would naturally want to see\n\n\fElma and to discuss the situation.",
    "But assuming that Holland was himself\ninnocent it looked as if he must have believed Elma guilty.",
    "Otherwise he might\nat least have waited to tell a true story to the police.",
    "32.",
    "Why did Sir Wilfrid ditto It was to be observed that Sir Wilfrid if his\nmovements had been correctly reported was in the van of the movement.",
    "He had\ngone up to London \u201cby the first train\u201d and that ran when was it Soon after\nseven \u2026 anyhow long before Elma was out of bed.",
    "Not before the body was\ndiscovered but surely before the rumour of its discovery was likely to have\nreached him.",
    "Either then the \u201ccall\u201d which summoned him had been\naccompanied by news of the tragedy\u2014and that meant Neddy Ware or the Vicar\nor Rundel Croft as its source or else he went up to London ignorant that the\nmurder had been committed \u2026 or at least ignorant that it had been discovered.",
    "Well well it might be an accident after all at least he must hear what the man\nhad to say.",
    "But what a curious influence Penistone must have had that his death\nseemed to scatter his acquaintances in alarm instead of rallying them in\nsympathy\n33.",
    "Why did the Vicar ditto Once again mere coincidence was possible\nMount might quite possibly have gone up to chat to an archdeacon about\ndilapidations.",
    "But it seemed more natural to connect his behaviour too with the\ngeneral upset.",
    "Now what precise development in the story had led to the Vicar\u2019s\nHegira The corpse had been discovered and he remained calm\u2014comparatively\ncalm.",
    "The disappearance of Elma and Holland left him still unmoved.",
    "What new\nfactor could have arisen in the situation It looked very much as if the Vicar had\nmade some discovery on his own a discovery which he had not seen fit to\ncommunicate.",
    "34.",
    "Was the Vicar telling all he knew Curious how people differed under\ncrossexamination.",
    "Elma Fitzgerald had a natural pose of hostility she so\nobviously resented being asked any questions about anything that it was\ndifficult to know whether she was embarrassed at being asked these questions\nabout this.",
    "Holland\u2019s contemptuous joviality was no doubt a permanent mood\nwith him it made him a difficult subject for interrogation because you never\nknew quite what allowances to make for his fun.",
    "But Mr. Mount now he was\nevidently a man anxious as a matter of conscience to tell the truth.",
    "But there\nwas a hesitation in his manner which seemed to suggest that he was not quite\nsure which part of the truth to tell not quite sure how he ought to answer one\nquestion for fear the next should trench on ground where he was determined not\nto tread.",
    "He was scrupulous about telling the truth and the scrupulous in this\nworld are apt to be more of a nuisance than the unscrupulous.",
    "35.",
    "Why did the Vicar water his garden It might of course be nothing more\n\n\fthan a horticultural gaffe.",
    "But if you were prepared to make a long shot and\nsuppose that the Vicar came into it somehow you naturally asked was he trying\nto hide traces Indulge the fancy and where did that lead Not his own traces\nsurely for he would be conscious of having left them and would have had the\nelementary common sense to obliterate them earlier in the day to obliterate them\nat some time when the police were unlikely to be about.",
    "The same consideration\napplied though with slightly less force if you thought of them as the traces of\nsomebody of whose presence he had been conscious at the time when they were\nmade.",
    "And yet he must surely have had some idea whose they were and how\nthey came there or his meticulous sense of justice would have induced him to\npoint them out to the police.",
    "A long shot but it needed thinking over.",
    "36.",
    "Why was the Admiral\u2019s pipe left in the Vicar\u2019s study Probably because\nthe Admiral forgot it and left it there.",
    "He had been in a hurry it seemed when he\nleft and the most punctilious of admirals will have these lapses occasionally.",
    "And he was as Holland had pointed out a man of many pipes.",
    "But Rudge\u2019s\nbrain was by now worked up into the state in which it could see significance in\neverything and even this pipe\u2014there was the bare possibility that the Admiral\nhad left it there on purpose in order to have an excuse for going back to the\nVicarage but apparently never went or that the Vicar himself had found it in\nsome place where it seemed all too likely to tell a story and had for safety\nremoved it elsewhere.",
    "Rudge perhaps with a theologian\u2019s unconscious animus\nwas already thinking of Mr. Mount as the sort of man who would not tell a direct\nlie but would be quite willing to let you deceive yourself \u201clead you up the\ngarden\u201d was his own less technical phrase.",
    "37.",
    "Why were Holland and Elma in such a hurry to get married That the\nlicence had already been procured before the murder took place seemed evident.",
    "But this in itself need not suggest foreknowledge of the murder Holland\u2019s own\naccount\u2014that Elma had encouraged him by her letter to expect the Admiral\u2019s\nconsent and that he had taken out the licence on the strength of that hope\u2014\nseemed sound enough as it stood.",
    "You could understand why there should be\nhaste in their proceedings while the Admiral was still alive and had given his\nreluctant consent.",
    "Who knew when he might change his mind But once he was\ndead that motive ceased to operate you would have thought it common decency\nto wait a little and according to Dakers it would have been common prudence\ntoo.",
    "There must be some reason but what reason Rudge admitted that at this\npoint the case defied him.",
    "38.",
    "Why did Holland conceal at first his alleged midnight interview His\nown excuse that he had concealed the whole story of his midnight journey\nsimply to avoid embarrassing questions when he was in a hurry seemed\n\n\fstrangely inadequate.",
    "On the assumption that his first story was true and his\nsecond false why should he cast doubt on his own veracity by this curious volteface On the contrary assumption why did he not stick to his lie when once he\nhad told it Having the typewritten consent in his pocket he could just as easily\npretend it had been given to Elma early on the previous evening before the\ndinnerparty what motive was there for insisting so strongly that it had only\nbeen drafted at midnight It looked as if some piece of evidence must have\ncropped up during the day which would make Holland\u2019s statement that he had\nslept soundly at the Lord Marshall inconsistent with the genuineness of the\ntypewritten consent.",
    "What could that evidence be Rudge tortured his\nimagination vainly over the problem.",
    "39.",
    "Why was the typewritten consent typewritten There was no typewriter in\nthe Admiral\u2019s room the documents in the files which were not holograph had\nplainly been copied out by a professional.",
    "Moreover the amateur to whom it is\na matter of labour to fit his sheet straight into the machine does not have\nrecourse to his typewriter unless he has a document of some length say four or\nfive lines to deal with.",
    "Improbable then \u2026 unless the document was a forgery\na signature being much easier to forge by mere imitation than a whole line of\nwriting.",
    "Or possibly the \u201cconsent\u201d might have been extracted by some threats or\nviolence in which case it was likely enough that the criminal should have\nexpedited matters by supplying a readymade formula.",
    "Mem.\u2014Ask Mrs. Holland\nwhere and by whom she thinks the typewriting was done.",
    "And so having got his ideas down on paper Rudge went off to bed\ncomforting himself with the old superstitious hope we all have sometimes that\nhe would wake up with an inspiration.",
    "But the night did not bring counsel.",
    "He\ndid indeed dream that he saw the actual crime being committed.",
    "But as in his\ndream the author of the murder was Mrs. Davis the victim Mr. Dakers the\nweapon a rolledup newspaper and the scene of the whole incident the Charing\nCross Hotel he wisely concluded that oneiromancy has its fallible moments.",
    "CHAPTER IX\nBy Freeman Wills Crofts\nTHE VISITOR IN THE NIGHT\nwoke next morning with a vaguely troubled mind.",
    "He had a\nsubconscious impression that this was no ordinary day and that important duties\nwere awaiting him.",
    "Then he remembered.",
    "His big chance had come He sprang\nout of bed.",
    "During breakfast he laid his plans for the day.",
    "First there was a conference\nwith his chiefs.",
    "Superintendent Hawkesworth had been on leave when the\nmurder took place and though Rudge had wired for him directly he had heard of\nit he was not expected back till early that morning.",
    "The Chief Constable Major\nTwyfitt had also been away but he had returned last evening and he also would\nwant to hear the news.",
    "Then there was the interview with the coroner about the\ninquest after which Rudge supposed he would be at liberty to take up one or\nmore of the lines of investigation he had thought out on the previous evening.",
    "He was a good deal worried that he had not yet been able to arrange for an\nadequate identification of the remains.",
    "Rudge did not himself doubt that the dead\nman was the Admiral but this had not been proved and it was his job to prove\nit.",
    "This question of identity would be the first to be raised by the Super and it\nwould probably be the only one in which at this stage the coroner would be\ninterested.",
    "Rudge walked round to the Lord Marshall on the chance that Dakers might be\nabout.",
    "Dakers should be his man for the identification.",
    "By a chance which Rudge\ntook as a good omen for the day it happened that as he entered the porch he met\nDakers coming out.",
    "\u201cGood morning sir\u201d Rudge said genially.",
    "\u201cThis is a bit of luck for me.",
    "I was\njust wondering if I could see you.\u201d\nDakers was polite but not genial.",
    "He showed no enthusiasm for the meeting.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d he asked shortly.",
    "\u201cThe identification of the remains sir.",
    "May I ask how long you knew the\nAdmiral\u201d\n\u201cHow long\u201d the solicitor repeated slowly.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s see.",
    "Twentyone\u2014two\u2014\nabout twentytwo years possibly twentythree.\u201d\n\u201cGood enough sir.",
    "And during that period you\u2019ve seen him I presume at\nINSPECTOR RUDGE\n\n\fintervals\u201d\n\u201cYes at irregular intervals I have.\u201d\n\u201cThen sir I should be obliged if when convenient you would run out with me\nto Lingham where the body is lying and see if you can formally identify it.\u201d\n\u201cI should like to have my breakfast first.\u201d\n\u201cI said sir when convenient.",
    "Would ten o\u2019clock suit\u201d\nDakers agreed and Rudge went on \u201cThere\u2019s another thing I\u2019d like to ask you\nabout while I have the opportunity and that is the late Admiral\u2019s consent to his\nniece\u2019s wedding.",
    "Do you happen to have it in your possession\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the typewritten statement\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\nDakers considered.",
    "\u201cHow do you come to be interested in that\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cIn the same way sir that I expect you\u2019re interested in it\u201d Rudge returned\npromptly.",
    "\u201cWe both I take it want to be sure that it was really given by the\nAdmiral.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u201d said Dakers frigidly \u201cthat Mrs. Holland is either a liar or a\nforger or both\u201d\n\u201cNo sir\u201d Rudge answered imperturbably.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Holland didn\u2019t say she got it\nfrom the Admiral.",
    "Mr. Holland said that.",
    "My question is really in Mrs. Holland\u2019s\nown interest.",
    "I take it that that document will have to be proved before she can\ninherit and I was going to suggest that the sooner its authenticity is established\nthe better.\u201d\nDakers became if possible even more frigid.",
    "\u201cThank you Inspector but I shall endeavour to look after my client\u2019s interests\nwithout the help of the police.\u201d\nRudge shrugged.",
    "\u201cAs you will sir.",
    "But you must realise that the police will\nhave to examine that document and I was merely suggesting that if you could\nsee your way to work with us in the matter it would save time and trouble.",
    "But of\ncourse it\u2019s as you like.",
    "Till ten o\u2019clock then sir.\u201d\nSuperintendent Hawkesworth was waiting for Rudge at the station and within\na few minutes Chief Constable Twyfitt arrived.",
    "Rudge at once gave a detailed\naccount of what had happened and what he had done with the steps he next\nproposed to take.",
    "The two men heard him without interruption Hawkesworth\nscribbling copious notes.",
    "\u201cThat seems all right Rudge as far as you have gone\u201d the Superintendent\nsaid glancing at his superior.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d Major Twyfitt agreed.",
    "\u201cI think Rudge has done quite well.",
    "And his\nproposals for carrying on seem sound.\u201d\n\u201cYes but there\u2019s too much in them for one man\u201d Hawkesworth decided.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to divide them up.",
    "Just let\u2019s settle what everyone\u2019s to do and then\nyou Rudge can get along with that identification.",
    "Now let\u2019s see.\u201d For some\nmoments he scribbled rapidly.",
    "\u201cThis\u2019ll do I think\u201d he went on.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll take on the\nChina affair.",
    "I\u2019ll get in touch with the Admiralty and the Foreign Office and that\nnewspaper man and any other place or person I can think of.",
    "Then I\u2019ll follow up\nDenny I dare say there\u2019s some connection between the two.",
    "Sergeant Appleton\nwe\u2019ll put on to Holland Holland\u2019s doings in this country that is Holland in\nChina will come under me.",
    "If necessary Appleton can go up to the Yard and get\nsome help there.",
    "At the same time he can find out if those two were really\nmarried in town.",
    "Constable Hempstead seems to have done well\u201d\n\u201cHe certainly has sir.",
    "He\u2019s no fool is Hempstead.\u201d\n\u201cVery well we\u2019ll give him his chance.",
    "We\u2019ll let him search the river both\nbanks over the length along which the boat could have floated.",
    "He\u2019s to look out\nfor traces of any kind particularly for footprints on the bank signs of a struggle\nplaces where the body might have been lifted into the boat and that missing bit\nof the painter.",
    "That\u2019ll keep him busy.",
    "You yourself Rudge take Rundel Croft\nand the people in it excluding the dead man who I think will come into my\ndepartment.",
    "That covers things in the meantime\u201d\n\u201cYes sir I think that\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\u201cWell you get along now.",
    "Then you\u2019re going to see the coroner Formal\nidentification and an adjournment of course\u201d\n\u201cOf course sir.\u201d\nFifteen minutes later Rudge and Dakers reached the public house at Lingham\nwhere the body of the deceased was lying.",
    "Dakers had recovered his good\ntemper and had chatted pleasantly enough during the drive.",
    "\u201cWell sir\u201d Rudge asked when the solicitor had stared for some moments at\nthe dead features.",
    "Dakers seemed to awake as from a reverie.",
    "\u201cOh yes\u201d he said without\nhesitation \u201cit\u2019s Admiral Penistone right enough.",
    "No doubt whatever.\u201d He\nappeared somewhat touched.",
    "\u201cPoor old fellow\u201d he went on \u201cI\u2019m sorry to see\nhim like that.",
    "We didn\u2019t see eye to eye in everything but still\u2014judging people\nas you find them I could say nothing but good about him.\u201d He turned away with\na sigh.",
    "\u201cI suppose you want me to give evidence of identity at the inquest\u201d\n\u201cIt would save Mrs. Holland\u201d Rudge pointed out.",
    "\u201cVery well.",
    "When does it take place\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow at ten sir.\u201d\n\u201cI shall be there.\u201d\n\u201cThank you sir.",
    "I suppose sir.\u201d Rudge smiled as if to discount the saying of a\nstupid thing \u201cI suppose Mrs. Holland really was the late Admiral\u2019s niece You\n\n\fsee no one here knows the family.",
    "As you are aware they moved here about a\nmonth ago.\u201d\n\u201cOf course she was\u201d Dakers answered testily.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t get far\non those lines Inspector.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to question everything sir as you know.",
    "Well sir I\u2019m obliged to\nyou for doing the identification.",
    "Where would you like to be put down\u201d\nThey drove back to the Lord Marshall and Dakers got out.",
    "Rudge was turning\naway but the solicitor stopped him with a gesture.",
    "\u201cAbout that consent Inspector.",
    "I\u2019ve been thinking over it and after all I don\u2019t\nsee any reason why you shouldn\u2019t see it.",
    "I haven\u2019t got it myself at the moment\nbut when I get it I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\nRudge thanked him again and the two men parted.",
    "Rudge was pleased with his\nday so far.",
    "He was certainly making progress.",
    "Already some of his theories had\nbeen eliminated and bedrock fact was beginning to emerge from the mass of\nspeculation in which the case was smothered.",
    "Rudge\u2019s business with the coroner was soon settled.",
    "It was obviously\nimpossible to complete the inquest and Mr. Skipworth agreed that all that was\nnow necessary was to carry on the proceedings far enough to enable a burial\norder to be given.",
    "This procedure had already been tentatively agreed on by\ntelephone and the meeting was really to run over the required evidence and\nmake sure that no unforeseen factor had arisen.",
    "For the rest of that day Rudge busied himself in trying to glean information\nabout the Rundel Croft household.",
    "He did not learn much it must be admitted\nbut he initiated a series of enquiries about each member the replies to which\nwhen received should prove valuable.",
    "Among the Admiral\u2019s papers he found\nthe Cornish address from which the deceased man had moved and he\ntelephoned to the Superintendent of the district for all available details of the\nfamily.",
    "He interviewed Elma Holland though unfortunately without much\nsuccess.",
    "He found out where the servants\u2014the butler and his wife and Elma\u2019s\npresent maid\u2014had been engaged and wrote to their former employers for\nfurther particulars of them.",
    "Lastly he made a general search of the house which\nhowever proved quite fruitless.",
    "At a few minutes before ten next morning Rudge entered the hall where the\ninquest was to be held.",
    "To tell the truth coroners\u2019 enquiries were formalities\nwhich completely bored him.",
    "A waste of time he considered them indeed worse\nthan a waste for he believed the time could always be used more profitably in\ncarrying on the normal investigation.",
    "As he had foreseen the proceedings afforded little of interest.",
    "The eleven\njurors did not elect to view the body and as soon as they were sworn evidence\n\n\fwas taken.",
    "Neddy Ware first told in detail of his discovery of the body.",
    "Then Mr. Dakers\nswore that he had seen the body and that he identified it as that of RearAdmiral\nHugh Lawrence Penistone.",
    "He gave a short outline of the Admiral\u2019s life\nexplained how he came to know him and then stood down.",
    "Next Dr. Grice\nstated the cause of death a wound in the heart from a knife or dagger with a long\nthin blade.",
    "A postmortem had shown that the Admiral was in reasonably good\nhealth for a man of his years.",
    "This brought the proceedings to a close the coroner stating that in order to\nenable the police to make further enquiries he would adjourn the inquest till that\nday three weeks.",
    "Once again Rudge was struck by the keenness of his reporter friend from the\nEvening Gazette.",
    "The man simply pestered him for news.",
    "A growing shortness in\nRudge\u2019s manner had no effect whatever and it was not till he threatened to give\nanything available to a rival journal that the man became reasonable.",
    "Another person who developed a surprising curiosity was Mr. Mount.",
    "Mount\nwas the first man Rudge had seen on reaching the coroner\u2019s court.",
    "This was not\nsurprising in a way because Rudge had himself told the Vicar that his presence\nat the inquest would be required.",
    "But owing to the decision only to take evidence\nof identification that morning Mount had neither been sent a summons to attend\nnor been officially informed of the place and hour.",
    "But there the man was and\nnot only so but he was evidently in an extremely curious as well as\napprehensive condition.",
    "On leaving the room Rudge found himself buttonholed by the Vicar.",
    "Under\nthe thinly veiled guise of a clergyman\u2019s natural interest in his parishioners\nMount made a really blatant attempt to learn the extent of the police knowledge\nof the case.",
    "But Mount was a child in the Inspector\u2019s experienced hands.",
    "Rudge\nreplied readily and with a convincing air of candour while warning the Vicar not\nto repeat his confidences.",
    "But Rudge knew that when the Vicar came to think\nover what he had been told he would be hard put to it to find out what those\nconfidences were.",
    "Rudge wondered if he had given enough attention to Mount.",
    "Sitting down in\nhis room he ran through his notes transcribing anything he had learned about\nhim.",
    "In the first place Mount was evidently already on intimate terms with the\nRundel Croft people.",
    "Then it was in his Mount\u2019s boat that the dead man had\nbeen found and more significant still Mount\u2019s hat had been in the boat.",
    "Then\nthere had been Mount\u2019s sudden journey to London there had been his watering\nof the garden and now there was this deep anxiety about the case.",
    "The more\n\n\fRudge thought over it the more he felt impelled to the conclusion that Mount\nmust somehow be implicated.",
    "Rudge considered the above points in turn but the only one from which he\nthought fresh light might be obtained was the man\u2019s visit to London.",
    "He recalled\nthe details.",
    "It was between twelve and one o\u2019clock that Mount had sent his note saying\nthat he was anxious to go up that afternoon to town on an urgent matter\nconnected with his clerical duties.",
    "Now that must have been a very sudden\ndecision.",
    "He Rudge had been speaking to Mount earlier in the morning and the\nman had said nothing about this visit then.",
    "Rudge did not know much about\necclesiastical matters but he doubted that business was done at that rate.",
    "Most\nprofessional visits to London would mean for clergymen meetings arranged a\nconsiderable time earlier or interviews with dignitaries also arranged some time\nbeforehand.",
    "He was inclined to doubt that the clerical duties in question had\nmuch to do with the church.",
    "Rudge wondered what he should do.",
    "Mount bore a high reputation for probity\nand if the matter were put directly to him he might give the required\nexplanation.",
    "Then Rudge saw that he would probably do nothing of the kind.",
    "He\nRudge had nothing to put which would demand an answer.",
    "Mount had hurried up to town.",
    "But so had Elma so had Holland so had\nDenny.",
    "Was it possible to believe that there was no connection between all these\nvisits Suddenly it seemed to Rudge that his best plan would be to try to trace\nMount\u2019s movements in town.",
    "It shouldn\u2019t take long and it might lead to\nsomething vital.",
    "Rudge went in and put his views before Superintendent Hawkesworth.",
    "Hawkesworth was impressed and agreed to release Rudge for a couple of days.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019d better advise them at the Yard what you propose to do\u201d said\nHawkesworth.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll ring them up that you\u2019ll call.\u201d\nThe first question was How had Mount made the journey Mount had a car\nbut most persons of moderate income went by train rail being so much cheaper\nfor the long distance.",
    "Mount had been at the Vicarage at one o\u2019clock and he had\nrung up Rudge from the Charing Cross Hotel at nine.",
    "There were two and only\ntwo trains he could have used the 2.5 from Whynmouth which reached\nWaterloo at 5.45 and the 4.25 from Whynmouth arriving at 8.35.",
    "Rudge began by calling at the office of the local newspaper and getting a\nphotograph of Mount.",
    "Then he went to the station and began his enquiries.",
    "He\nlearned at once that Mount had been seen on the day in question.",
    "He had been\nnoticed particularly by both the bookingclerk and the ticketcollector and for\nthe same reason.",
    "He had it appeared bought a London ticket but he had not\n\n\ftravelled by a London train.",
    "He had gone by the 1.30 which connected at\nPassfield Junction with the 11.0 a.m. express from \u201cWaterloo to the west.",
    "He\nhad explained that he wished to break his journey and would go on to London by\na later train.",
    "As Rudge jogged along in the next train to Passfield Junction he reminded\nhimself of the lie of the land.",
    "The main line of the Western Division of the\nSouthern Railway ran from Waterloo to Devon past Whynmouth.",
    "It did not\nhowever go through Whynmouth it ran at this point some ten miles inland.",
    "Whynmouth was the terminus of a branch which left the main line at this\nPassfield Junction a small roadside station some fifteen miles away in the\nLondon direction.",
    "The nearest town to Whynmouth on the main line was\nDrychester.",
    "It lay on the Exeter side of Whynmouth twelve miles away by road.",
    "There was no direct rail connection between the two places the route being by\nPassfield Junction.",
    "At each of the small stations between Whynmouth and Passfield Junction\nRudge jumped out of the train and enquired if the Vicar had been seen alighting\non the day in question.",
    "But it was not till he reached the junction that he got any\ninformation.",
    "Mr. Mount was slightly known to the stationmaster and he believed he had\nseen him on that day entering a thirdclass carriage of the down express.",
    "Rudge\nwent at once to the bookingoffice and there he learned that only three thirdclass tickets had been issued by that train\u2014a single to Exeter and two returns to\nDrychester.",
    "From this it seemed pretty clear that Mount had booked to\nDrychester.",
    "In due course Rudge reached Drychester.",
    "But here he had not the same luck.",
    "Drychester station was a busy place very different to the small roadside\njunction.",
    "No one knew Mount and no one had noticed a clergyman resembling\nhim.",
    "It looked however as if Mount had reached Drychester at 2.40.",
    "If so he\nwould have been too late to have caught the earlier of the two trains to town and\nmust therefore have gone by the second leaving Drychester at 4.50.",
    "That is he\nwould have had two hours and ten minutes in Drychester.",
    "What could he have\ndone in that time\nRudge could form no idea.",
    "He thought first of going down to the cathedral and\nmaking enquiries of the vergers but he wasn\u2019t anxious that it should be known\nthat he was making this investigation.",
    "At last as a sort of forlorn hope he decided\nto interrogate the taximen at the station on the offchance that Mount might\nhave driven to his destination.",
    "Armed with his photograph Rudge went round the men.",
    "He did not expect to\n\n\fget much and he was therefore agreeably surprised when he suddenly found he\nhad struck oil.",
    "But he did not realise not for a long time after how deep and\nhow rich was the well he had tapped.",
    "When he showed the photograph to one of the men a little weazened rat of a\nfellow it produced a reaction.",
    "\u201cAye\u201d said the man \u201cI\u2019ve seen the gent all right I \u2019ave.",
    "But not \u2019ere.",
    "I\u2019ve\nseen \u2019im in Lingham.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said Rudge \u201cin Lingham have you That\u2019s no good to me.",
    "I\u2019m looking\nfor traces of him here.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see \u2019im \u2019ere guv\u2019nor.",
    "Never seen \u2019im but the once in Lingham.\u201d\nRudge\u2019s fate Mount\u2019s fate and the fate of several other persons trembled in\nthe balance.",
    "Rudge was about to pass on to the next driver but fortunately for\nhimself he didn\u2019t.",
    "Fortunately for himself he asked the fateful question \u201cWhen\nwas that\u201d\n\u201cLast Tuesday night\u201d the taximan replied \u201cat a \u2019ouse near Lingham about a\n\u2019arf a mile beyond the village an\u2019 down on the river.\u201d\n\u201cBeside the church\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right guv\u2019nor.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what time was that\u201d\nThe man paused in thought.",
    "\u201cAbout midnight or a bit after.\u201d\nRudge\u2019s heart gave a sudden leap.",
    "Midnight or later on the night of the crime\nwas a very critical hour in the case.",
    "At midnight the terrible drama which led to\nAdmiral Penistone\u2019s death must already have been under way.",
    "What the Vicar\nwas doing at midnight was something that he would be extraordinarily glad to\nknow.",
    "\u201cBetter tell me all about it\u201d Rudge suggested carefully keeping the eagerness\nout of his voice.",
    "But the man\u2019s story instead of clearing up the situation seemed only to make\nit still more incomprehensible.",
    "It seemed that on that night the night of the\ncrime he had been on duty when the last train arrived from town the 7.0 p.m.\nfrom Waterloo.",
    "It arrived at 10.20 and he got a fare from it.",
    "It was a lady a\nsmall middleaged woman with a bright quick manner.",
    "As far as the taximan\ncould see in the somewhat poor light of the lamps she was elegantly dressed and\nvery goodlooking.",
    "Quite an attractive lady he evidently thought.",
    "She had asked\nhim to drive her to a house in Lingham which she would point out wait for her\nfor a few minutes and bring her back to the Anglers\u2019 Arms at Drychester.",
    "Except that it was rather late to pay a call this seemed reasonable to Rudge.",
    "He knew the trains from town.",
    "The last train having a connection to Whynmouth\nleft Waterloo at 5.30.",
    "The 7.0 from town did not stop at Passfield Junction and\n\n\fthe only way in which a passenger by that train could reach Whynmouth was by\ndriving the twelve miles from Drychester.",
    "\u201cI follow you\u201d Rudge said.",
    "\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\nThe man had driven his passenger to Lingham and she had directed him to the\nhouse he had mentioned near the church.",
    "She had asked him to wait on the road\nso as she said not to rouse the children with the sound of the engine.",
    "She had\nsaid she would not be long.",
    "Then she had disappeared in the direction of the\nhouse.",
    "That must have been a few minutes before eleven.",
    "The taximan settled down to wait and wait he certainly did.",
    "The few minutes\npassed three or four times over and still there was no sign of her.",
    "He began to\nget impatient and getting out of the taxi he walked up the short drive till he got\nin sight of the house which had been hidden behind a small plantation.",
    "The\nhouse was dark and silent and no one seemed to be about.",
    "The taximan grew\nanxious about his fare and he went forward and knocked at the first door he\ncame to.",
    "Rudge recognised it as the sidedoor.",
    "For a time no one answered and\nthe taximan knocked louder and louder.",
    "At last a window opened upstairs and\nthis parson put his head out.",
    "What was it a sick call The taximan gave him\nclearly to understand it was not a sick call and the parson said he\u2019d come down.",
    "He came down and asked what was wrong.",
    "The taximan asked would his\npassenger soon be out as he had an early job in the morning and he didn\u2019t want\nto spend the night waiting at the gate.",
    "The parson evidently didn\u2019t know\nanything about the lady but he asked for a description of her.",
    "Then suddenly he\nseemed to recognise her.",
    "He appeared upset for a moment then he said it was all\nright that he thought the lady was a friend of the housekeeper\u2019s and if the taximan would wait a moment longer he would find out when she was leaving.",
    "He\ndisappeared for three or four minutes then he returned to say that the lady had\nbeen taken with a fainting fit and in the excitement the taxi had been forgotten.",
    "The lady was not well enough to go back to Drychester that night but would\nstay with his housekeeper and he would pay the taxi.",
    "He had done so.",
    "The taximan had returned to Drychester and that was all he knew about it.",
    "Here was a fresh complication Rudge swore.",
    "Instead of things straightening\nthemselves out the tangle was getting worse.",
    "\u201cTell me\u201d said Rudge \u201cyou drove through Lingham didn\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cCorrect guv\u2019nor.\u201d\n\u201cDid you stop there\u201d\n\u201cNot above a minute or two.",
    "I stopped and the lady directed me which way to\ngo.\u201d\nHere was at least something.",
    "This must have been the car Constable\nHempstead had seen.",
    "So far as it went Hempstead\u2019s report was corroboration of\n\n\fthe story.",
    "Rudge postponed consideration of the affair and walked to the Anglers\u2019\nArms which was near the station.",
    "And there he got some news which he\nthought entirely justified his suspicions.",
    "It seemed that about seven o\u2019clock on the evening in question a telegram had\nbeen received from Waterloo to the effect that the sender Mrs. Marsh was\ngoing to Drychester by the next train and required a room to be reserved for the\nnight.",
    "Also she wished the hotel to be left open as owing to having to pay a call\non arrival she could not reach it till midnight or later.",
    "The room had been duly\nprepared and the porter had waited up till nearly two but the lady had not turned\nup nor had anything been since heard of her.",
    "This certainly did back up the tale that the lady had intended to return from\nLingham Vicarage to Drychester.",
    "So far the thing looked bona fide enough.",
    "It\nwould however be easy to get the details at the Vicarage.",
    "In the meantime\nRudge must not lose sight of his present quest what was Mount doing at\nDrychester\nHe produced his photograph and asked if the hotel manager had ever seen the\noriginal.",
    "And then came the information which brought all his suspicions of\nMount back with a rush and made him congratulate himself on having followed\nup this line of the case.",
    "Mount it appeared had called at the hotel on the day following that on which\nthe telegram had been received and Rudge saw that he must have gone there\nimmediately on arrival in Drychester.",
    "He had stated that he was conducting a\ndelicate enquiry on behalf of a member of his church.",
    "It concerned an unhappy\nmarriage he hoped the manager would not ask for details.",
    "His parishioner\u2019s wife\nhad intended to meet her husband on the previous night with reference to a\npossible reconciliation returning afterwards to the Anglers\u2019 Arms and there\nspending the night.",
    "But she had not turned up and his friend was very distressed\nabout her.",
    "He the friend wishing to keep his family skeleton hidden had not\nhimself come to the hotel to make enquiries but had deputed him the Vicar to\ndo so in his stead.",
    "Could the manager give him any information about the lady\nThe Vicar could not say under what name she might have registered.",
    "Though the manager did not personally know Mount he had seen him at\nfunctions at the cathedral and was satisfied of his bona fides.",
    "He therefore gave\nhim all the information at his disposal.",
    "Mr. Mount had thanked him and had at\nonce left.",
    "Rudge imagined that this interview had probably constituted Mount\u2019s whole\nbusiness in Drychester but to make assurance as sure as possible he went to the\ncathedral and in the guise of a former parishioner asked the head verger if he\n\n\fhad ever heard of his old rector the Rev.",
    "Philip Mount who he believed was\nnow in charge of a parish somewhere near.",
    "From this beginning it was easy to\nsteer the conversation in the way it should go and Rudge was soon convinced\nthat the Vicar had not been at the cathedral on the day in question.",
    "Rudge caught the last train to town that night.",
    "Next morning he was early at\nScotland Yard where he explained that he wanted to make some enquiries at the\nCharing Cross Hotel and possibly elsewhere.",
    "He was asked if he required help\nand on his saying that he did not he was told to go ahead and ring up if he was\nstuck.",
    "Assured of a free hand Rudge went on to the hotel.",
    "There with the aid of his\nphotograph he had no difficulty in establishing the fact that Mount had arrived at\na few minutes before nine on the evening he rang up evidently from the train\narriving at Waterloo at 8.35.",
    "So far as was known he had not gone out that night.",
    "Next morning he had paid his bill after breakfast and left.",
    "So far it had been plain sailing for Rudge.",
    "Enquiries at the reception office\nand from waiters and chambermaids had quickly brought him his information.",
    "But now he was up against something stiffer.",
    "In vain he questioned porters and\nmessenger boys.",
    "The head porter remembered seeing the Vicar but he couldn\u2019t\nremember how he had left.",
    "He or one of his staff might have got a taxi for him\nbut they got so many taxis they couldn\u2019t be sure.",
    "Rudge was extremely persistent but success did not crown his efforts.",
    "Mount\nhad gone but no one knew how.",
    "Rudge went out into the square in front of the station.",
    "In all probability Mount\nhad walked to where he had wanted to go or if not had taken a \u2019bus or gone\ndown to the Underground.",
    "If so Rudge did not see how he could possibly get on\nhis track and he would be forced to return to Whynmouth and fall back on the\nchance of getting a statement.",
    "Such a statement Mount might of course refuse\nto make and Rudge didn\u2019t see how he could force it from him.",
    "No if he Rudge\ncould find out what Mount had done in town it would be infinitely better.",
    "He wondered whether Mount might not after all have taken a taxi.",
    "The porters\nmight have forgotten the circumstance or Mount might have come out into the\nsquare and hailed one himself.",
    "Rudge decided to make enquiries of those drivers\nwho used ranks near the hotel.",
    "He began at once and a long job he found it.",
    "To man after man he showed his\nphotograph and asked if he had taken the Vicar up.",
    "And man after man shook his\nhead and said he had never seen the gentleman.",
    "But Rudge persevered.",
    "These enquiries were his only hope and he would be\nquite sure they led nowhere before abandoning them.",
    "And then at last his\nperseverance reaped its just reward.",
    "A driver came in from a job and took his\n\n\fplace at the tail of the line.",
    "Rudge went up to him with his photograph.",
    "The driver was by way of being discreet.",
    "He had seen Mount but he didn\u2019t\nknow what business of Rudge\u2019s that was.",
    "A little judicious backsheesh however\novercame his scruples and he told what he knew.",
    "Mount it appeared had hailed\nhim from the station square and told him to drive to Judd Street to a private\nhotel.",
    "He didn\u2019t just remember the number but he could find the place again.",
    "\u201cThen find it\u201d said Rudge getting in.",
    "Presently they drew up at Friedlander\u2019s Private Hotel and in a couple of\nminutes Rudge was interviewing the manageress.",
    "Yes the clergyman of the\nphotograph had called on the morning in question.",
    "He had asked to see Mrs.\nArkwright a lady who had been staying with them for some three weeks.",
    "But\nMrs. Arkwright had gone away unexpectedly the evening before and had not yet\nreturned so the clergyman was disappointed.",
    "He had left his name and address\nRev.",
    "Philip Mount Lingham Vicarage Whynmouth Dorset and asked that Mrs.\nArkwright be requested to ring him up when she returned.",
    "He had then gone\naway.",
    "Rudge turned the conversation on to Mrs. Arkwright.",
    "The manageress was\nreticent but still he managed to pick up a good deal.",
    "Mrs. Arkwright was\nmiddleaged small active and vivacious.",
    "She was decidedly goodlooking and\nalways dressed well.",
    "Though evidently not rich she seemed comfortably off.",
    "The manageress was not certain that she might not be French.",
    "They had a French\ngirl staying at the hotel and Mrs. Arkwright spoke French to her as fluently as\nshe spoke English to the others.",
    "Rudge felt he was getting on.",
    "That this Mrs. Arkwright had unexpectedly\ntravelled from London to Drychester on the evening before the crime now\nseemed clear.",
    "Having during the journey mysteriously become Mrs. Marsh she\nhad driven to the Vicarage and there vanished.",
    "Rudge would have liked to search the lady\u2019s room and belongings but he had\nno warrant and he did not think he could manage it otherwise.",
    "However by\njudicious pumping he obtained a little more information from the manageress.",
    "Mrs. Arkwright was pleasantmannered and a favourite among the residents.",
    "She had not however many friends of her own by which the manageress meant\nvisitors.",
    "Indeed the manageress might say she had only one visitor a man who\ncalled at irregular intervals.",
    "He was tall and distinguishedlooking and his\nforehead was bronzed as if he had lived in some hot country.",
    "The manageress\nindeed had seldom seen so goodlooking a man.",
    "His name was Mr. Jellett.",
    "Rudge was in a reflective frame of mind as he left the hotel and automatically\nturned his steps to the nearest tube station.",
    "There was something very puzzling\nabout this whole business.",
    "That this Mrs. Arkwright or Marsh had gone to the\n\n\fVicarage on the night of the murder there could be no doubt.",
    "But it wasn\u2019t at all\ncertain that she had seen Mount.",
    "From what he had said to the taximan it was\ndifficult to believe that Mount knew she was there.",
    "At the same time Rudge\nfound it equally difficult to believe the story about her visiting the housekeeper\nand getting a fainting fit.",
    "In either case where had the woman disappeared to It\nalmost seemed as if Mount himself did not know and that his journeys to\nDrychester and London were simply an effort to find out.",
    "To Rudge it looked very much as if there had been some secret negotiations in\nprogress between the Vicar and this woman.",
    "Whether he had seen her on the\nnight of the crime or not something had happened to make him want to see her\nthe next day.",
    "And there was an element of secrecy about the whole thing which\nlooked anything but well.",
    "Then Rudge remembered something he had been told by the garrulous\nlandlady of the Lord Marshall Hotel at Whynmouth.",
    "This man Mount had had\ntrouble in his life.",
    "His wife had run away from him with some man.",
    "Now could it\nbe \u2026 \nRudge whistled softly between his teeth.",
    "If Mrs. ArkwrightMarsh were really\nMrs. Mount it might at least partially account for these mysterious proceedings.",
    "Some question possibly that of a divorce might have been raised which would\nhave necessitated an immediate interview.",
    "This would account for the visit to the\nVicarage and Mount\u2019s subsequent journey to town though it might not explain\nMount\u2019s denying knowledge of her call.",
    "Oh yes it might though.",
    "Rudge saw\nthat he had been wrong.",
    "In the excitement of discussing a divorce the taxi might\nwell have been forgotten and when Mount found it waiting he might have\ninvented the story about the housekeeper to allay possible scandal.",
    "On the whole Rudge thought this theory promising enough to justify further\nenquiry into it.",
    "He did not see it must be admitted how it was connected with\nthe death of Admiral Penistone but that connection was suggested by the boat\nthe hat and particularly by the Vicar\u2019s eagerness at the inquest.",
    "How Rudge wondered could he find out about Mount\u2019s erring wife He\nthought for a while then returning to the Yard borrowed a Crockford.",
    "From\nthis he found that Mount had been in his present position for ten years before\nwhich he had been a curate in one of the Hull churches.",
    "Rudge immediately put\nthrough a call to the Superintendent at Hull asking him to try to obtain a\ndescription and if possible a photograph of Mrs. Mount.",
    "In a couple of hours there was a reply to say that a photograph and description\nhad been obtained and were being sent up to the Yard.",
    "On Monday morning they arrived.",
    "The photograph had been got from one of\nthe local newspaper offices and showed the lady in a hospital committee group.",
    "The description gave Rudge a thrill of satisfaction.",
    "It looked as if he were on the\nright track.",
    "In half an hour he was back in the hotel in Judd Street.",
    "He was sorry to trouble\nthe manageress again but would she be good enough to tell him if Mrs.\nArkwright was among this group\nThe manageress hesitated a little but when he explained that the photograph\nwas ten years old she became quite certain.",
    "Yes that fourth lady from the left\nwas undoubtedly Mrs. Arkwright.",
    "Full of selfsatisfaction Rudge took the first train from Waterloo.",
    "Determined\nto be thorough he went to Drychester and saw his friend the taximan.",
    "Here he\nhad not such definite confirmation though the man agreed that his passenger\nmight well have been the original of the photo.",
    "It was with the gratifying consciousness of something attempted something\ndone that Rudge returned to the police station at Whynmouth that afternoon to\nreport his progress to Superintendent Hawkesworth.",
    "Hawkesworth however\ntook the disappointingly narrow view of achievement so frequently displayed by\nAuthority.",
    "\u201cHuh\u201d he said when Rudge had finished \u201cit looks to me like a washout.",
    "This\nblessed parson is considering making things up with his wife or divorcing her or\nwhatever you like to make it.",
    "But that won\u2019t help us any with the question of\nwho killed old Penistone.",
    "What do you propose to do now\u201d\n\u201cI thought sir of going to Mount and asking for an explanation.\u201d\nHawkesworth frowned.",
    "\u201cAn explanation of just what\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cAn explanation of where Mrs. Mount went to that night.",
    "The boat was gone\nit was connected with the murder who took it Did Mrs. Mount I think sir we\ncould press that question under the circumstances.\u201d\nThe Superintendent considered then nodded shortly.",
    "\u201cVery well try it.",
    "You\nmay as well now you\u2019ve gone so far.\u201d\nRudge was bitterly indignant as he drove out to Lingham Vicarage.",
    "This was\nalways what happened when you took trouble and did anything specially well\nWhat sort of mind had Hawkesworth Surely to goodness it was clear that this\ninformation about Mrs. Mount was vital Her unexpected visit to the Vicarage\non the night of the crime her unexpected disappearance after arrival there\nMount\u2019s ignorance or assumed ignorance of the whole affair.",
    "The boat the hat\nMount\u2019s sudden attempt to find his wife Mount\u2019s subterfuges to keep his real\nbusiness from leaking out\u2014ecclesiastical matters he had said to Rudge a\nparishioner\u2019s unhappy marriage he had told the Drychester hotelkeeper family\nnews he had explained to the lady in Judd Street.",
    "\u2026\nIn fact the whole thing was darned fishy and he would be bound to get some\n\n\fvaluable information from Mount.",
    "Somewhat cheered Rudge set out for the\nVicarage.",
    "CHAPTER X\nBy Edgar Jepson\nTHE BATHROOM BASIN\nhad been cherishing his aunt Mrs.\nEmery.",
    "At first when she returned to her native neighbourhood and settled down\nat Rundel Croft he had showed himself nephewly but in moderation certainly\nnot to the point of cherishing her and even now the cherishing it is to be feared\nwas not a natural effusion of pure nepotic feeling.",
    "It was the result of feeling\nindeed of two feelings a strong feeling a hunch in fact that the secret of the\nmurder of the Admiral was to be found in Rundel Croft and a scarcely less\nstrong feeling that the society of Jennie Merton was good for him.",
    "So it came about that during the last week he had been often in the house.",
    "When he was on his round all kinds of reasons for just looking in on his aunt\noccurred to him the house being empty except for her and Jennie and Emery\nburglars might have broken in or the chickens might have been stolen or he had\nto ask her some question connected with the mystery of no great importance or\nhe had to give her some information of no great importance about the progress\nof the police towards the solution of it.",
    "He was gifted with a quite decent\ncreative imagination which doubtless was often of use to him in the witnessbox.",
    "When he was off duty he would in nephewly fashion drop in to tea or\nsupper.",
    "It is to be doubted that Mrs. Emery who had rather more than her fair share of\nwomanly intelligence as the wives of the Emerys of this world generally have\nascribed his assiduity to the finer feelings of a nephew.",
    "She perceived that Jennie\nwas as a rule at hand\u2014she would have a good view of the drive from the\nwindows of the upper part of the house where most of her work lay\u2014to open\nthe door to him when he called.",
    "Also she had once heard her say as she was\nbringing him from the back door to the kitchen \u201cOh go hon Mr. Hempstead\u201d\nWell as Mrs. Emery saw it Jennie was a good girl as girls go nowadays and\nshowed quite a lot of sense in the way she was picking up cooking and cooking\nwas what a man really wanted when he was married and in any case Dick was\none of those pigheaded young men who will go their own way and he might\ndo worse.",
    "Anyhow who was she to interfere with love\u2019s young dream\nSo it came about that Hempstead had had the run of Rundel Croft for Elma\nPOLICE CONSTABLE RICHARD HEMPSTEAD\n\n\fHolland and her husband had not been in his way.",
    "If sometimes he was not\nalone but accompanied by Jennie when he was having the run of it it did no\none any harm.",
    "Also he was a useful man to have about for in a big house like\nRundel Croft little things were always getting out of order and going wrong and\nhe was useful with his hands.",
    "Mrs. Emery soon fell into the way of getting him\nto set the little things right that the Admiral had been used to set right putting a\nspring in a lock that had ceased to work restoring a patch of paint that had been\nrubbed off to maintain in fact the spick and spanness the Admiral had\ndemanded.",
    "He was a useful visitor.",
    "He had inspired into Jennie his strong opinion that the solution of the mystery\nof the murder was to be found in the house and though she would have helped\nhim in his search or at any rate superintended it at intervals in any case that\nidentity of opinion made her help him with enthusiasm.",
    "Together they searched the house with uncommon thoroughness every nook\nand cranny of it especially the Admiral\u2019s study and bedroom and Elma\nHolland\u2019s sittingroom and bedroom hunting above all for the missing white\nfrock in which Elma had dined at the Vicarage.",
    "\u201cMind you Jennie I don\u2019t say as you\u2019re wrong in thinking that she packed it\nup that morning and took it to London with her\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut there\u2019s a\npossibility that she rolled it up small and stuffed it away in some hole or corner\nand if so be as we could find it I\u2019ll eat my helmet if we don\u2019t find it marked in\nsome way or another that would be a useful clue.",
    "It might even be bloodstained.\u201d\n\u201cIt might truly\u201d said Jennie in thoughtful agreement.",
    "They found several holes and corners in which the frock might have been\nhidden but they did not find the frock.",
    "Then on Monday afternoon as they were finishing their tea and it was just\nabout the time that Inspector Rudge was reporting at Whynmouth police station\nMrs. Emery said \u201cThere\u2019s one thing Dick as you might have a look at before\nyou go and that\u2019s the basin in the bathroom.",
    "Miss Elma complained when she\ncame back that the water ran out of it very slowly and now it\u2019s quite choked up\nand it won\u2019t run out of it at all.",
    "It\u2019s a job for a plumber I know but you might be\nable to do something with it.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s easy Aunt\u201d said Hempstead with manly confidence.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s just a\nmatter of clearing out the trap.\u201d\nHe finished his tea\u2014he was always rather longer about it than his uncle and\nthe two women\u2014and having gathered the tools he wanted from the house toolbox he and Jennie went up to the bathroom and he got to work.",
    "It was an easy\njob for after he had taken up the linoleum he found the board in the floor above\n\n\fthe trap loose to enable the inevitable plumber to get at the trap easily.",
    "He\nunscrewed the nuts and lifted the cover off the trap.",
    "The trap was choked with\nhair and he began to pull it out.",
    "He was struck by its coarseness and paused to\nexamine it.",
    "Then he said \u201cThis is rum.",
    "If I hadn\u2019t seen the beard on the Admiral\u2019s chin I\nshould have said as he\u2019d shaved it off.\u201d\n\u201cIt is like the Admiral\u2019s beard\u201d said Jennie.",
    "\u201cOnly it\u2019s not so grey.\u201d\nHempstead picked the rest of the beard out of the trap carefully and put it in\nthe little enamel basin he had brought up with him to hold the debris that was\nchoking the trap with a very thoughtful air.",
    "Then he said \u201cAunt said that Mrs. Holland complained of how slowly the\nwater ran out of the basin when she came back from London after getting\nmarried.",
    "I don\u2019t suppose anybody had used that basin between then and the\nmorning after the Admiral was murdered.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose they did\u201d said Jennie.",
    "\u201cSo if anyone was shaving off his beard\u2014\u201d said Hempstead thoughtfully and\nstopped short.",
    "He had said enough.",
    "It was no good talking about things.",
    "Besides he wanted\nto think it out.",
    "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t say anything about this not even to my aunt or uncle\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt may be important.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not\u201d said Jennie.",
    "\u201cAnd certainly not to your aunt.",
    "It would be all\nover the place before night.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you might find me a piece of thick brown paper.",
    "I can\u2019t dry this hair in\nfront of the kitchen fire \u2019cos my aunt would see it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you can\u2019t\u201d said Jennie and she went in search of brown paper.",
    "Presently she came back with it.",
    "Hempstead squeezed the water out of the\nshavedoff hairs and wrapped them in the brown paper and put the little packet\nin his pocket.",
    "They went down to the kitchen.",
    "\u201cI suppose nobody used that basin between Mrs. Holland\u2019s going away to get\nmarried and coming back Aunt\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNobody that I know of\u201d said Mrs. Emery.",
    "\u201cWell I\u2019ve cleaned out that trap for you and the water\u2019s running quite free\nagain\u201d he said and took his leave of them.",
    "He went away thoughtful thinking it out in search of Inspector Rudge.",
    "He found him just outside the Vicarage gates displayed his find and told him\nwhere he had come across it.",
    "\u201cIt is\u201d said the Inspector \u201ca rum go\u2014in the trap of the bathroom basin at\nRundel Croft Well well.\u201d\n\n\fHis eyes brightened as he began to perceive the implications of the discovery.",
    "\u201cYes sir.",
    "And Mrs. Holland complained that the water was running slow out\nof the basin when she came back after gettin\u2019 married and nobody seems to\nhave used that basin between that and her going away.",
    "It looks as if there\ncouldn\u2019t have been any hairs in that trap when the Admiral went off to dinner at\nthe Vicarage the night he was murdered.",
    "There certainly hasn\u2019t been anyone\nwith a beard in the house since Mrs. Holland went away the morning after the\nmurder.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you mean is that whoever shaved off that beard shaved it off on the\nnight of the murder\u201d said the Inspector frowning thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s right sir.\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Holland didn\u2019t wear a beard by any chance\u201d said the Inspector.",
    "\u201cNo sir I saw him about three or four times when he was courting Mrs.\nHolland and he was just the same as now.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said the Inspector and he went on frowning.",
    "Then he said \u201cBut whoever it was called that night at the Lord Marshall and\nasked for Mr. Holland did have a beard and it seemed to me pretty clear that it\nwasn\u2019t the Admiral at all and this seems to settle it.",
    "Whoever wore the beard he\nwent back to Rundel Croft and shaved it off.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right sir\u201d said Hempstead.",
    "\u201cWell he couldn\u2019t have done that unless he knew someone at Rundel Croft\nvery well and it could only have been the Admiral himself or Mrs. Holland.",
    "If\nthe Admiral was alive it might have been him but if the Admiral was dead it\ncould only have been Mrs. Holland\u201d said the Inspector.",
    "\u201cBut it could hardly have been the Admiral sir because whoever it was\nshaved off his beard he shaved it off because he didn\u2019t want anyone to know\nthat he\u2019d been pretending to be the Admiral\u201d said Hempstead.",
    "\u201cExactly and it doesn\u2019t seem likely that the Admiral should want anyone to\npretend to be him.",
    "But it was someone who knew one of them right enough.\u201d\n\u201cBut the very last place that anyone who\u2019d committed the murder would want\nto be seen in is about here\u201d protested Hempstead.",
    "\u201cM\u2019m\u201d said the Inspector.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019d seen the silly things murderers do that\nI\u2019ve seen.",
    "Besides there are some people who call themselves criminologists\nwho say that a murderer always goes back to the scene of his crime.\u201d\n\u201cDoes he now\u201d\n\u201cNo he doesn\u2019t\u201d said the Inspector.",
    "He was silent considering the possibilities opened up by Hempstead\u2019s\ndiscovery.",
    "Then glowing with quiet cheerfulness he added \u201cWell what we want is a\n\n\fman with a beard who has shaved it off.",
    "Now where have I seen a man lately\nwho\u2019d shaved off his beard I fancy I have.\u201d\n\n\fCHAPTER XI\nBy Clemence Dane\nAT THE VICARAGE\nrang and getting no answer rang again.",
    "He could hear the bell jangling\nin the deeps of the house but he could not hear any sound of footsteps.",
    "The\npeace of summer which lay upon the garden had had its effect apparently upon\nthe house itself.",
    "All its blinds were down and he could hear the loud ticking of\nthe grandfather clock in the hall.",
    "Putting his eye to the keyhole he observed a\nThat there was no key in the lock and b that the hall was empty.",
    "No guilty\nVicar was standing within upon the mat quaking in his shoes afraid to ignore\nthe summons yet afraid to open.",
    "All was a teatime quiet yet there was no\npleasant chink of china no tinkle of spoons.",

    "Girls often carry out their sewing\nto a paddock.",
    "I\u2019ll go round.\u201d\nHe went round.",
    "The neat flagged courtyard at the back was however equally\ndeserted.",
    "The kitchen door was locked and there was nobody in the sheds at the\nfurther side of the yard.",
    "On the kitchen door however a card was pinned a\nwhite card such as is used at funerals and on it was inscribed BACK AT SEVENTHIRTY.",
    "So that was that Unwillingly for in spite of his professional zeal Inspector\nRudge would have enjoyed a cup of tea he tramped out of the little yard.",
    "The\nnoisy echoes of his feet breaking the silence he skirted the garden.",
    "He should\nhave gone straight out into the street and knew it.",
    "Unless he were doing his\nofficial duty he was a trespasser without rights.",
    "But he had two hours to put in\nbefore he could return.",
    "Virtuously he resolved to wander about the village\ndropping questions casually as Cockneys drop aitches and perhaps visit that\nvillage sphinx old Wade in the hope of gleaning some stray straw of\ninformation.",
    "Still it was exceedingly hot.",
    "Why hurry Besides wasn\u2019t that a\ngreengage tree strapped up like a flogged prisoner to the wall at the corner of the\ngarden\nNow if Inspector Rudge had a weakness it was for that deceptive fruit the\ngreengage.",

    "He plucked ate dripped juice from chin and fingers and dropped the\nstone at his feet.",
    "As he did so a glint of light caught his eyes and made him peer downwards.",
    "The glint explained itself quickly enough but it was not the bit of broken bottle\nwinking in the sun which held his attention after that first preliminary glance yet\nhis attention was held\u2014held by a couple of greengage stones not of his spittingout but not yet dry.",
    "By them lay a handkerchief juicestained rolled into a ball\nand on the bare ground at the foot of the tree were footprints small neat\nfootprints.",

    "Then pulling himself to his feet was\npreparing to grope his way into the open when nearer much louder much more\nvigorous came a second scream a whole series of screams and there burst out\nof the dark open entry the figure of Elma Holland.",
    "Once out of the doorway she appeared to have no further power to walk\nthough she laboured forward a short step or two as if she were thrusting her way\nthrough an invisible hedge.",
    "Her face was white as the washed walls of the house\nand as her husband who came racing the next moment across the threshold\nreached her she fell back into his arms like a stuffed sack.",

    "Very still was the study barred with sun and shadow very cool very dark.",
    "It\nwas a pleasant coolness and a pleasant darkness after the glare of the lawn.",
    "\u201cQuiet as a tomb\u201d thought the Inspector to himself.",
    "\u201cSo what\u2019s she screaming\nabout\u201d Then as he moved to the writingtable which was set at an angle to the\nwindow rampartwise he saw what Elma Holland had screamed about.",
    "Slid down upon the floor between the desk and the wall lay the body of a\nwoman.",
    "Her eyes were open and glazed like the eyes of a carefully painted\nwaxwork on her cheeks the makeup stood out in hectic patches on the skin.",
    "Her\ntwo hands were clasped upon her breast not peacefully but in a last gesture of\nenergy.",
    "They were clasped about a knifehandle whose blade was sunk in the\nstained folds of her flowered summer dress.",
    "CHAPTER XII\nBy Anthony Berkeley\nCLEARING UP THE MESS\nplumped down on his knees beside her heedless of the blood which lay\neverywhere on the carpet.",
    "The woman was still warm and the blood had\nscarcely ceased to flow from her breast.",
    "But quite certainly she was dead.",
    "A voice from the doorway brought the Inspector to his feet again.",
    "\u201cWe were in the hall when she did it.",

    "Rudge frowned.",
    "\u201cI thought I told you to stop outside sir.\u201d\n\u201cOh damn your rotten little orders man.",
    "Here\u2019s a woman stabbed herself it\u2019s\nno time to stand on ceremony.",
    "Is there anything we can do Is she dead Are you\ncertain\u201d\nRudge got slowly to his feet.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s dead right enough.",
    "Must have died just\nabout the time you were in the house.\u201d\n\u201cShe died in my arms then\u201d said Holland sombrely.",
    "Rudge glanced at the blood on the other\u2019s hand and Holland nodded.",
    "\u201cI held her up for a second\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI thought she was dead so didn\u2019t\ndisturb her hands or take the weapon out.\u201d\n\u201cThat was wise of you sir.\u201d\n\u201cYou know who she is of course My wife\u2019s French maid\u2014C\u00e9lie.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cI shall have a few questions to ask you and Mrs.\nHolland.\u201d\n\u201cLater\u201d Holland said in his masterful way.",
    "\u201cMy wife\u2019s very much upset at\nthe moment.",
    "Naturally.",
    "I can\u2019t have her worried till she\u2019s had time to recover.\u201d\nRudge lifted his eyebrows slightly but all he said was \u201cI must ask you not to\nleave these premises for the present either of you.",
    "Where is Mrs. Holland now\u201d\n\u201cI put her in a hammock on the lawn.",
    "I must get back to her.",
    "We\u2019ll wait for\nyou there Inspector.",
    "Anything we can tell you of course we will.\u201d\nThere was the sound of footsteps on the gravel outside which marched\nwithout hesitation into the hall.",
    "\u201cAnyone about\u201d called a voice.",
    "The next\nmoment the figure of the ubiquitous reporter from the Evening Gazette appeared\nin the doorway.",
    "With a muttered word Holland slid past him and out of the\nhouse.",
    "RUDGE\n\n\fA shaft of sunlight from the window flashed cheerfully on the reporter\u2019s hornrimmed spectacles.",
    "\u201cHullo Inspector.",
    "Didn\u2019t expect to see you.",
    "Is the Vicar\nabout\u201d He caught sight of what lay at Rudge\u2019s feet.",

    "I\u2019ll see you\nget your story later.",
    "There are\u2014\u201d Further sounds of footsteps outside caused him\nto break off short.",
    "Both men listened intently.",
    "Again the footsteps progressed\nwithout hesitation into the house and along to the study.",
    "The Vicar came into\nthe room.",
    "\u201cWhy Inspector\u201d he said in surprise.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were to be present\ntoo.",
    "Has\u2014oh\u201d For a moment he appeared too frozen with horror to move.",

    "\u201cCelia\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch her please sir.\u201d Rudge bent down as if to guard the body from\nthe Vicar\u2019s ministrations.",
    "The latter turned a ravaged face up to him.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s dead\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so sir.\u201d\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t\u2014killed herself\u201d\n\u201cIt looks uncommonly like it sir.\u201d\nMr. Mount dropped his face into his hands and remained motionless for nearly\na minute.",
    "When he spoke again it was with more selfpossession.",
    "\u201cInspector you know who this poor soul is\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s already been identified sir as Mrs. Holland\u2019s late French maid.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The Vicar paused for a moment as if to stiffen himself in a resolve.",
    "\u201cInspector there are many things connected with this tragedy that I cannot tell\nyou.",
    "My lips are sealed by the confessional.",
    "But if it will serve the interests of\njustice this much I can say this poor woman is my wife.",
    "And alas I fear that it is\nI who drove her to this terrible deed.\u201d\n\n2\n\u201cYou sir\u201d said the Inspector sharply.",
    "\u201cHow is that\u201d Then catching sight of\nthe newspaper man he added \u201cHere I told you to clear out.\u201d He was about to\nseize the fellow by the shoulder and hustle him out of the room by way of some\nphysical vent for the various emotions that were boiling inside him when he saw\nfrom the other\u2019s white face and shaking hands that it was not just callous\nprofessional curiosity which had kept him there the man looked indeed almost\nincapable of walking.",
    "Rudge laid a gentle instead of a ferocious hand on his arm\nand led him towards the door.",

    "\u201cYes but we didn\u2019t kill\u2014women.",
    "I\n\n\fthink I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d\nThe Vicar pushed past the Inspector and took charge leading the man into a\nsmall lavatory that opened off the hall just inside the front door.",
    "\u201cStay there till\nyou feel better\u201d he nodded and returned with the Inspector to the study.",
    "\u201cTurns some people up blood does\u201d commented the latter.",

    "\u201cThe mother of my boys Inspector.",
    "Perhaps I was too\nharsh with her.",
    "Too narrow perhaps.",
    "Yet what else could I have done My creed\nexpressly forbids divorce.",

    "\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s too explicit.\u201d\n\u201cShe wanted you to divorce her\u201d Rudge gently dropped the question into the\nVicar\u2019s musings which seemed to be addressed more to himself than to the\nInspector.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "I never knew the name of the man who induced her to run away with\nhim she always refused to tell me perhaps it was better so.",
    "But he seems to\nhave been kind to her according to his lights.\u201d It was plain that the Vicar was\ntrying hard to be just.",

    "Especially in view of what I had\nto say.\u201d\n\u201cYou repeated your refusal then\u201d\n\u201cWhat else could I do\u201d asked the Vicar piteously.",

    "\u201cI told you just now Inspector that on\nsome points my lips are sealed.",
    "That is one of them.\u201d\nAgain the two looked at each other.",

    "\u201cYes.",

    "Major Twyfitt the Chief Constable had motored back home but luckily he\nhad not taken back Hawkesworth to the county town with him.",
    "Together the two\nas soon as Dr. Grice had arrived had searched the house but nothing had been\ndiscovered to throw any further light on the death.",
    "The Superintendent was now\nmaking arrangements for the removal of the body and Rudge found himself at\nliberty for a few words with Mr. and Mrs. Holland.",
    "Mrs. Holland was still in the hammock.",
    "That she had received a severe shock\nwas obvious but already she was showing such signs of recovery that Rudge\nwho wished to put his questions while impressions were still strong thought\nhimself justified in overriding Holland\u2019s objections to an immediate interview.",
    "He dropped with a carefully unofficial air on the grass beside the pair.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate sir I agree.",
    "But you\u2019ll understand that I must do my duty.",
    "Now would you be good enough to tell me first of all what you know about this\nappointment When did Mrs. Mount make it and what reason did she give\u201d\nRudge had addressed his question to Elma but it was Holland who answered\nit.",
    "\u201cShe rang us up at the Lord Marshall just after lunch today and asked us to\nmeet her here.",
    "She gave no reason.\u201d\n\u201cBut you would have inferred one\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWas it you who spoke to her on the telephone\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Holland\u2014a little reluctantly Rudge thought.",
    "\u201cIt was my wife.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Rudge turned pointedly to Mrs. Holland.",
    "\u201cWhat reason did you infer\nthen madam\u201d\n\u201cNone.\u201d Elma\u2019s tone was as curt as ever.",
    "\u201cYou did not ask for any\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBut it must have seemed strange to you that your late maid should want to\nmeet you at the Vicarage\u201d\n\u201cI imagined she was upset about something and wanted advice and did not\ncare to come to the inn where she might be recognised.\u201d\n\u201cBut why shouldn\u2019t she be recognised\u201d\nElma shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cThat I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know that she was Mrs. Mount\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\u201cIt surprises you\u201d\n\u201cVery much.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Rudge tentatively \u201cyou can see some way in which that fact\nmay throw light on your uncle\u2019s death\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t\u201d Elma retorted.",
    "\u201cBut of course it gives a reason for her\nhaving left me\u2014my service so abruptly.\u201d\nRudge nodded.",
    "\u201cYes that\u2019s true enough.",
    "By the way you say you imagined\nshe was upset about something.",
    "Did she sound upset on the telephone\u201d\n\u201cAgitated perhaps\u201d Elma said slowly.",
    "\u201cYes she did.\u201d\nAnd yet not too agitated Rudge thought to eat greengages before the\nconference she had called.",
    "\u201cIt never occurred to you\u201d he went on \u201cthat the advice you thought she\nwanted might be on some matter connected with your uncle\u2019s murder Mrs.\nHolland\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not\u201d Elma replied sharply.",
    "\u201cWhy should it\u201d\nRudge might have given more than one reason for his question.",
    "Instead he\n\n\fasked slowly and significantly \u201cHow much did C\u00e9lie\u2014know\u201d\nHis shot got home.",
    "Elma paled then flushed and sent a glance towards her\nhusband which was a patent appeal for help.",
    "Holland supplied it at once.",
    "His words took Rudge by surprise.",
    "He did not bluster or attempt to end the\ninterview merely remarking \u201cIt\u2019s curious you should say that Inspector I\nasked my wife that identical question not an hour ago.",
    "I too had considered the\npossibility that she might be about to give us some information on the Admiral\u2019s\ndeath.",
    "But my wife was positive she could have known nothing.\u201d\n\u201cHow could she\u201d asked Elma in relieved tones.",
    "Rudge glanced from one to the other.",
    "He knew very well that Mrs. Holland\nhad said nothing of the sort at any rate just then.",
    "He was not sure that he had\nbeen wise.",
    "In an attempt to frighten information out of them he had intimated to\nthe pair that he had overheard their conversation while they were waiting and\nHolland of course had seen him come out of the bushes.",
    "They could not know\nfor certain that he had not been able to hear them too while Elma was in the\nhammock.",
    "And yet Holland had not been in the least frightened.",
    "He had taken\nthe thing quietly out of Rudge\u2019s hands reassured his wife and returned an\nanswer which was admirable in its noncommittal quality.",
    "Rudge had to console\nhimself with the fact that without doubt Elma had just for an instant lost her\ngrip.",
    "These two must know something\u2014but Rudge recognised that there was not\nthe faintest hope of getting it out of them by direct questioning.",
    "Anxious not to put them too much on their guard he tried another line.",
    "\u201cNow\nwill you tell me sir exactly what happened when you got into the house You\nnoticed the front door open I think and followed Mrs. Holland inside\u201d\nHolland smiled slightly.",
    "\u201cAs you saw Inspector from your laurel bush yes.",
    "By the way\u201d he added more sternly \u201chad you some idea that anything like that\nwas going to happen Because if so \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI had no idea sir no more than yourself.",
    "Now will you kindly give me those\nfacts\u201d\n\u201cWell I followed my wife into the hall.",
    "We thought that C\u00e9lie\u2014Mrs.",
    "Mount\n\u2014must have come as the door was ajar.",
    "We looked into the drawingroom first\nthen the diningroom.",
    "I think it was while we were in the diningroom which\nadjoins the study you know that we heard a scream\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA terrible scream\u201d put in Mrs. Holland with a shudder.",
    "\u201cYes it was terrible.",
    "I\u2019ve never heard anything so\u2014well awful\u2014producing\nawe.",
    "It was just like an animal.",
    "I dashed out of the diningroom and into the\nstudy but before I got there I heard a thud which must have been made by her\nfall.",
    "And there she was on the carpet and the blood streaming out.",
    "As I told\nyou she died in my arms.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOhhhhhh\u201d shuddered Elma.",
    "\u201cI see.",
    "Thank you sir.",
    "And you Mrs. Holland That coincides with your own\nimpressions\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I think so.",
    "Perhaps I should have said myself that we heard her fall\nbefore my husband moved but I couldn\u2019t be sure.\u201d\n\u201cBut you think not sir\u201d\nHolland considered.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t say.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "I suppose we stood still for a\nfew seconds.",
    "Sort of frozen you know.",
    "Yes perhaps we heard the thud before I\nmoved.",
    "I\u2019m not sure we didn\u2019t now I come to think.",
    "But in any case there\ncouldn\u2019t be more than a second and a half in it either way.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you followed your husband into the study madam\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d Elma faltered.",
    "\u201cAnd saw\u2014and saw \u2026\u201d She covered her face with her\nhands and her body shook.",
    "Holland leapt up.",
    "\u201cInspector\u201d he said in a low voice \u201cget out.\u201d\nRudge got.",
    "In any case he had not expected to learn anything more.",
    "4\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s suicide\u201d growled the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cThe doctor says her\ngrip on the dagger must have been applied during life there\u2019s only her prints on\nit the Hollands were within a few yards of the room when she did it and\nactually heard her fall Rudge had command of the front door and the back door\nremained bolted on the inside and when he searched the house there was no one\nin it.",
    "How could it be anything but suicide\u201d The Superintendent spoke\nscornfully.",
    "Rudge said nothing but his ruddy cheeks grew a shade ruddier still.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t agree Rudge\u201d said the Chief Constable.",
    "\u201cNo sir I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t.",
    "The way I look at it is this.",
    "Would a woman going\nto commit suicide fill up the time beforehand by eating greengages It isn\u2019t\nnatural.\u201d\n\u201cThen are you saying Holland killed her\u201d asked the Superintendent sharply.",
    "\u201cBecause there\u2019s no one else who could.\u201d\n\u201cNo sir I\u2019m not saying that either.\u201d\nIt was the following morning and a conference was being held at Whynmouth\npolice station.",
    "Already there was tension in the air and further tension\nthreatened.",
    "The possibilities of Mrs. Mount\u2019s death being due to suicide or\nmurder had been discussed already for at least half an hour and no decision had\nyet been reached.",
    "The Superintendent was all for suicide and the Chief\n\n\fConstable had to agree that the logic was on his side Inspector Rudge\nobstinately clung to murder and when challenged to produce his proofs could\nonly mutter puerilities about things being \u201cnatural\u201d or the reverse and \u201cfeeling\nthings in his bones\u201d no wonder the Superintendent snorted.",
    "Major Twyfitt had\npersevered nobly in a Chief Constable\u2019s first duty that of holding the balance\nbetween two disputing subordinates but did not know how soon it might not\nescape from his grasp.",
    "He determined now to shift the ground of discussion.",
    "\u201cWell of course Rudge\nif you feel that way you\u2019ll do all you can to collect evidence to support your\nideas.",
    "Otherwise I think we can leave it for the time being to the coroner.",
    "Now\nabout the murder of Admiral Penistone.",
    "You told us last night of the dead\nwoman\u2019s identity with C\u00e9lie Blanc the lady\u2019s maid which does definitely\nconnect the Vicarage with the tragedy as you\u2019ve felt all along\u201d said the Chief\nConstable soothingly.",
    "\u201cAnd you told us about Hempstead\u2019s discovery in the\nbathroom at Rundel Croft.",
    "Now have you any ideas where all this is going to\nlead us\u201d\n\u201cI have sir\u201d replied the Inspector grimly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve a very good idea indeed.\u201d\n\u201cAh that\u2019s good.",
    "What is it\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not say sir if you don\u2019t mind until I\u2019ve collected a little more\nevidence\u201d Rudge answered with a sideglance at the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cYes yes of course.",
    "So long as you\u2019re working on definite lines.",
    "Well the\nSuperintendent has got the details from the Admiralty now about that episode at\nHong Kong which you\u2019d like to hear.",
    "Just let Rudge have the facts\nSuperintendent.\u201d\nSuperintendent Hawkesworth drew a folded paper from his breastpocket\nopened it and in a totally expressionless voice read\n\u201c\u2018Captain Penistone was involved in a disgraceful scene in Hong Kong in\n1911.",
    "By his own admission he followed a girl who was being illtreated by a\nChinaman into a lowclass den which was already unfavourably known to the\nauthorities.",
    "After that he stated that he remembered nothing further.",
    "He was\nhowever seen in an advanced state of intoxication singing and dancing in the\ncompany of a number of seamen of both British and other nationalities and\nChinese coolies and he was carried on board his ship the next morning still\nunder the influence of drink and opium by a party of his own men who had\nrecognised him the previous evening.",
    "In consideration of his record Captain\nPenistone was permitted to send in his papers instead of being tried by courtmartial.",
    "On the outbreak of hostilities with Germany Captain Penistone\nvolunteered his services in any capacity and in view of the emergency he was\nreinstated temporarily with his rank of Captain.",
    "He served with distinction\n\n\fthroughout the War and so far as the Admiralty was concerned the regrettable\nincident at Hong Kong was expunged from the records.",
    "The Admiral however\nexpressed to several of the senior officers here his dissatisfaction with the affair\nand his belief that a good deal more lay behind it than had ever appeared and he\nused to state his intention of devoting his leisure on retirement to getting to the\nbottom of it but as to whether there were any grounds or evidence for this belief\nnothing is known here.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cFollowed a girl in did he Well that clears up one point\nsir doesn\u2019t it File X\u201d\n\u201cYou mean File X contained the evidence he had collected to support his\nview that the incident was rigged\u201d nodded the Chief Constable.",
    "\u201cYes that\u2019s the\nview we\u2019d come to.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it gives you something else Rudge\u201d added Hawkesworth.",
    "\u201cIt gives you\nmotive.",
    "Those papers had disappeared from the folder hadn\u2019t they Obviously\nthey were taken after the murder by the murderer.",
    "In other words the Admiral\nwas right.",
    "He\u2019d got his evidence\u2014and it was going to implicate somebody who\ndidn\u2019t want to be implicated.",
    "So the Admiral was murdered to stop him blowing\nthe gaff.",
    "Well that gives us a pretty strong pointer.",
    "The murderer is a man who\nwas in Hong Kong in 1911.",
    "Anything wrong with that\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u201d Rudge agreed.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s right enough sir.",
    "Must be.",
    "But there\u2019s one\nthing I can\u2019t understand and that\u2019s Mr. Holland\u2019s story about seeing the\nAdmiral in his study with a lot of papers on his desk after midnight that night.",
    "According to what the doctor says that\u2019s just the time the murderer ought to\nhave been looking for File X.\u201d\n\u201cAnd perhaps so he was\u201d said the Superintendent darkly.",
    "\u201cIf you mean Holland sir\u201d said Rudge returning to an old difficulty \u201cwhy\ndid he want to come out with that story at all when there was no evidence that\nhe wasn\u2019t safe in bed and asleep at the Lord Marshall\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean Holland\u201d snapped the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cI mean the man\nHolland saw.",
    "The man whom he mistook for the Admiral.",
    "The man who was\nimpersonating the Admiral\u2014for the third time.\u201d\n\u201cThe third time\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Once in the study once at the Lord Marshall and once\u2014in Hong\nKong\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d Rudge registered such genuine admiration that the Superintendent\nforgave him his foolishness about Mrs. Mount.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a smart bit of work sir if\nI may say so.\u201d\n\u201cYou can bank on it that\u2019s the murderer\u201d said the Superintendent\ncomplacently and his tone added that that was not the end of the smart work.",
    "\u201cBut wait a bit\u201d cried the Inspector excitedly.",
    "\u201cThat means Mrs. Holland\u2019s in\nit.",
    "Holland gave it away that she was in the study too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd haven\u2019t you thought all the time that Mrs. Holland knew a good bit\nmore than she let on\u201d\n\u201cI never thought she was actually mixed up in the murder\u201d Rudge confessed.",
    "With an air of triumph the Superintendent rose and unlocked a cupboard.",
    "From it he produced a package and from the package a white chiffon frock.",
    "His\nlarge hands looked absurdly incongruous on the delicate stuff as he draped the\ndress over the back of a chair before the eyes of the Inspector.",
    "His reason for\ndoing so was plain there was no need for him to point to the rustycoloured stain\nthat smeared one hip.",
    "\u201cThe missing white dress.",
    "Got a warrant to search her\nroom at the Lord Marshall and found it at the bottom of a drawer\u201d he said\nbriefly.",
    "\u201cI knew she knew something\u201d exclaimed Rudge.",
    "\u201cWhy do people keep damning evidence against themselves\u201d Major Twyfitt\nasked.",
    "\u201cLucky for us they do sir\u201d said Hawkesworth.",
    "To Rudge he added \u201cMind\nyou I don\u2019t think she was in it from the start.",
    "But she\u2019s an accessory after all\nright.",
    "And that gives us another pointer.",
    "See it\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u201d nodded Rudge.",
    "\u201cThe brother Walter.",
    "I\u2019ve had him in mind from\nthe beginning.\u201d\n\u201cYou have eh\u201d said the Superintendent somewhat discomfited.",
    "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t\nyou ever say so then\u201d\n\u201cNo evidence\u201d replied Rudge smugly.",
    "\u201cAnyhow it seems clear enough now\u201d interposed the Chief Constable.",
    "\u201cWe\ncan assume I think that if anyone has been impersonating the Admiral either in\nHong Kong or here it must have been this Walter Fitzgerald.",
    "There must have\nbeen a strong resemblance.",
    "We\u2019ve got evidence of that too Rudge.",
    "Two\nwitnesses who saw a man in Whynmouth on the day of the murder whom they\nmistook in the distance for the Admiral and only realised when they were quite\nclose that it was a younger man.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir And that gives me another idea.",
    "May I put through a telephone call\nto London\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nRudge consulted his notebook and then gave the number of Friedlander\u2019s\nHotel and asked for priority.",
    "The connection was made in less than two minutes.",
    "Rudge explained who he was and said \u201cYou remember telling me that Mrs.\nArkwright only had one regular visitor a tall man with a bronzed forehead Did\nthis man wear a beard He did Thank you.\u201d He rang off.",
    "The other two looked at him enquiringly.",
    "\u201cThat connects up something more.\u201d Rudge was unable to conceal his\nsatisfaction.",
    "\u201cThe man who ran off with Mrs. Mount the man whose name the\nVicar never knew\u2014that was Walter Fitzgerald too.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said two breaths simultaneously.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s beginning to work in.\u201d\nThe Superintendent cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cNow my theory of what happened\nthat night is this.",
    "This man this Walter Fitzgerald came down\u2014Yes What is\nit Oh come in.\u201d A loud knock at the door had broken him off in midsentence.",
    "Police Constable Hempstead entered looking thoroughly pleased with\nhimself.",
    "In his hand he held a short length of manilla rope knotted to another\nshort length.",
    "\u201cHope I\u2019m not disturbing you sir\u201d he said to Major Twyfitt \u201cbut\nthought you\u2019d like to know at once.",
    "I\u2019ve searched both banks thoroughly this\nmorning from Rundel Croft to the sea and found nothing except this.\u201d\n\u201cThe missing bit of the painter\u201d exclaimed Rudge.",
    "\u201cWhere was it Sorry\nsir\u201d he added perfunctorily to the Chief Constable who nodded goodhumouredly.",
    "\u201cCaught up in some bushes \u2019bout halfway down on the Vicarage side.\u201d\n\u201cGood man\u201d said the Chief Constable as he took the rope and even\nHawkesworth grunted approval.",
    "\u201cDid you make any enquiries at the cottages\u201d asked Rudge.",
    "\u201cEvery one sir.",
    "Nobody heard or saw anything.",
    "But I\u2019ve found out something\nelse.\u201d\n\u201cYou have eh What\u201d\n\u201cWell you remember that set of photos you gave me sir of the fingerprints\non the oars in the Admiral\u2019s boat Well I believe I\u2019ve identified them.\u201d\nHempstead produced a piece of paper which the Superintendent took before\nanyone else could reach it.",
    "He whipped another set of the photographs out of his pocket and pored over\nthem for a minute.",
    "Then he looked up.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the man.",
    "Who is it Hempstead\u201d\nHempstead beamed with selfimportance.",
    "\u201cNeddy Ware sir.\u201d\n\n5\nWhen Rudge left the police station for a belated lunch he had a good deal to\nthink about.",
    "The business was getting altogether too widespread for his liking.",
    "Half the inhabitants of Lingham seemed now to be implicated in the murder or\nat the least accessories after it.",
    "The Vicar Elma Holland and now Neddy Ware.",
    "There was another point against Neddy Ware too.",
    "The plaster casts which had\n\n\fbeen taken of the footprints on the bank showed a number which had been\ndefinitely identified as the Admiral\u2019s several of his niece\u2019s and just a few of a\nlarge coarse sole studded with nails which could belong to nobody at Rundel\nCroft but a gardener but they might belong to Neddy Ware.",
    "The impressions\nwere good and the Super was going to find out himself after lunch whether\nthey were Neddy Ware\u2019s or not but no one had any doubt now on the point.",
    "He had been cunning had Neddy Ware.",
    "The Inspector ruefully acknowledged\nto himself that he had been completely taken in by the old man.",
    "Neddy Ware had\ngiven him precisely correct information on all matters concerning the river and\nits tides which he could have checked from anyone else who was familiar with\nthem even on points which might have told against himself he had been\naccurate but what about his speculations which the Inspector had unconsciously\nput on practically the same basis as the rest It was difficult now to disentangle\nspeculation from fact even in consultation with his notebook but there seemed\nto Rudge two main ideas which Ware had deftly given him and which had lain in\nhis mind ever since as a basis on which any theory of the crime must be founded\nthat if the Admiral had taken his boat out at all that night he must have taken it\ndownstream and that it would have taken him an hour to row to Whynmouth.",
    "How did these two ideas look now\nFor the first there really seemed no reason at all.",
    "Why must the Admiral have\ngone downstream So that the abandoned boat could have drifted to where it\nwas found at the time it was found.",
    "But was it found at that time And at that\nplace The whole of Ware\u2019s first story must now be viewed with the deepest\nsuspicion.",
    "What about the second point then From Rundel Croft to Whynmouth by\nwater was about two and threequarter miles.",
    "The Admiral must have started at\nbetween a quarterpast and halfpast ten.",
    "At that time the tide was even\naccording to Ware\u2019s own information at its strongest ebb.",
    "Could a lusty man not\nrow a boat with a swiftly flowing tide to help him at faster than a slow walking\npace Nonsense of course he could.",
    "Twice as fast.",
    "Very well then.",
    "Neddy Ware\nhad wanted to deceive the police as to the time the Admiral could have reached\nWhynmouth that night assuming for the moment that on the other point he had\nbeen speaking the truth and it was downstream the Admiral had gone.",
    "Now\nwhy the deuce had he wanted to do that\nAt this point the Inspector mechanically pushed his full plate of gooseberry\npie away from him and allowed one of his landlady\u2019s best efforts to get stone\ncold.",
    "There were only two possible reasons that Rudge could see one that\nsomebody had an alibi for halfpast eleven but not for eleven o\u2019clock and the\n\n\fother to make the police think that the man who called at the Lord Marshall just\nafter eleven was an impostor\u2014which was exactly what they did think.",
    "But in\nthat case the man really was the Admiral.",
    "\u2026\nThis was getting altogether too difficult.",
    "Rudge noted the point for future\nreference and followed another line.",
    "There was another advantage too in shifting forward the time of events by half\nan hour or so.",
    "Just after midnight the brother Walter Fitzgerald had been in the\nAdmiral\u2019s study.",
    "This extra halfhour gave him plenty of time to get there break\nthe news to his sister and begin his search for File X by midnight.",
    "Without it\nRudge had found the timetable exceedingly cramped.",
    "Well there already were the answers to any number of his thirtynine articles\nof doubt.",
    "Rudge turned them up in his notebook and glanced through them to\nsee whether this intervention of Neddy Ware\u2019s cleared up any more puzzles.",
    "It did at once.",
    "26 Why was the Admiral wearing a coat Rudge remembered\nthe difficulty.",
    "If it was the Admiral who had taken out his boat that night and a\nfairly warm night at that why wear a coat for hard rowing But suppose it was\nnot the Admiral who had been doing the rowing.",
    "Suppose it was Neddy Ware\nwho had not only brought the boat back but had taken it out too with the\nAdmiral as a passenger.",
    "There was a profitable line of enquiry.",
    "If only that were\ntrue Neddy Ware must know not only where the Admiral had gone but who had\nkilled him.",
    "But how on earth to find out if it were true Because quite certainly\nNeddy Ware would not give himself away on that point.",
    "Well there was only one possibility.",
    "The Vicar had been sitting in his\nsummerhouse.",
    "He might have seen.",
    "Rudge had had a suspicion already that the\nVicar had seen something from that summerhouse.",
    "Well the Vicar had got to\nbe made to speak that was all.",
    "Falling at last on his gooseberry pie Rudge swept the plate clean in half a\ndozen gargantuan mouthfuls followed them with a couple of bites of bread and\ncheese and ran down to the street and his car.",
    "Mr. Mount was in and had just finished his own lunch.",
    "He received the\nInspector in his study.",
    "Rudge came to the point at once.",
    "\u201cSorry to bother you again sir but we\u2019ve\ninformation that Admiral Penistone left Rundel Croft in his boat at about tenfifteen.",
    "You were sitting in your summerhouse at that time overlooking the\nriver.",
    "Did you see him leave\u201d\nThe Vicar answered at once.",
    "\u201cSince you ask me the direct question Inspector\nyes I did.\u201d\n\u201cThank you sir.",
    "Is it any good my asking why you didn\u2019t let me have this\ninformation sooner Although I never actually asked you you must have known\n\n\fit would be very valuable.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly I will tell you.",
    "It was because I feared that my knowledge might\nlead you to suspect an innocent man.\u201d\n\u201cI see sir.",
    "Then you know who murdered Admiral Penistone\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d the Vicar retorted \u201cI don\u2019t.",
    "But I\u2019m pretty sure who didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWell we\u2019ll leave that.",
    "Which way did the Admiral head sir Upstream or\ndown\u201d\n\u201cDown.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Neddy Ware was rowing him\u201d\nThe Vicar looked first startled and then distressed.",
    "\u201cInspector if you suspect\nold Ware of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t sir.",
    "Not of the murder.\u201d\n\u201cI have your word\u201d\n\u201cYou have Mr. Mount.\u201d\n\u201cVery well.",
    "Then I will admit to you that Ware was rowing the Admiral that\nnight and extremely surprised I was to see it.",
    "I had no idea they were even\nacquainted.",
    "But that is the reason why I said nothing of what I saw.",
    "We parsons\nhave to rely a good deal on our estimate of people\u2019s natures you know and I\nwould stake everything I have on the fact that old Ware is totally incapable of\nanything of that kind.",
    "I\u2019ve known him ever since he came to Lingham you see\nso I feared that this information of mine would put you on an entirely wrong\nscent.",
    "I therefore determined to volunteer nothing myself but to use what\ninfluence I may have with Ware to induce him to come to you of his own accord\nand give you a full account of his own knowledge of that night\u2019s happenings\nwhatever it may be.",
    "I may say I have quite failed.\u201d\n\u201cHe told you he wouldn\u2019t come to us\u201d\n\u201cMore than that.",
    "He denies that he was in the boat at all he says that I was\nmistaken.\u201d\n\u201cWe have quite definite evidence that he was sir his fingerprints on the\noars.\u201d\n\u201cYes I was quite sure I was right.\u201d\n\u201cWell we must tackle Ware ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt whether you\u2019ll get much out of him.\u201d\n\u201cWe shall see sir.",
    "In the meantime are you sure there isn\u2019t anything else\nyou\u2019d like to tell us yourself sir about that night\u2014without necessarily\nincriminating anyone\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u201d said the Vicar firmly.",
    "6\n\n\fRudge left the Vicarage in some elation.",
    "Not only had his surmise been\nconfirmed that Ware was rowing the boat but definite evidence was at last\nforthcoming that it had headed downstream.",
    "Curious that old Ware had been so\ninsistent on that point too.",
    "Except for the single suggestion about the length of\ntime needed for the journey it seemed as if Ware had not been trying to deceive\nhim at all\u2014almost as if he had been attempting to put him on the right track.",
    "Was it possible that Neddy Ware\u2019s guilty knowledge sat heavily upon him that\nhe thoroughly wanted the Admiral\u2019s murderer to be caught but that at the same\ntime like a schoolboy he would not directly give him away When one came to\nthink of it that really was the only explanation of his behaviour.",
    "But if so it was\na pity in a way for Rudge knew Neddy Ware well enough to be quite certain\nthat if the old man had made up his mind not to give the murderer away no\npossible means could be found of making him do so.",
    "Anyhow one could but try.",
    "Hastily obtaining permission from Major Twyfitt\nfor the interview and learning at the same time that the theory of the footprints\nhad been proved correct Rudge drove out to Ware\u2019s cottage.",
    "The old man was sunning himself in the garden and seemed thoroughly\npleased to see his visitor.",
    "\u201cWell Mr. Rudge still puzzled about them tides\u201d\nRudge sat down on the same bench.",
    "\u201cNo Ware it\u2019s not the tides this time it\u2019s\nsomething more serious.",
    "I want you to tell me what you were doing in the\nAdmiral\u2019s company last Tuesday night\u2014the night he was murdered\u201d\nOld Ware looked the picture of innocent astonishment.",
    "\u201cMe I wasn\u2019t in his\ncompany.",
    "Whatever put that idea in your head Mr. Rudge I didn\u2019t even know\nhim by sight.",
    "Didn\u2019t I tell you the next day I hadn\u2019t recognised him\u201d\n\u201cYou did and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t believe you.",
    "Especially as you were in Hong\nKong when there was that scandal about him so you must have known all about\nthat though you never let on a word.",
    "Now look here Ware I\u2019m not threatening\nyou mind I wouldn\u2019t do anything like that but at the same time I\u2019m ready to\ntell you that we\u2019ve got evidence that you called for Admiral Penistone at Rundel\nCroft last Tuesday evening and rowed him downstream at a quarter past tea.",
    "And what\u2019s more I\u2019ll tell you what the evidence is you were seen starting\nthere\u2019s your fingerprints on the oars and there\u2019s your footprints on the bank.",
    "So\nyou see there\u2019s no getting away from it.",
    "Now I needn\u2019t tell you this puts you in a\nnasty position.",
    "Mind you I don\u2019t think you had anything to do with the murder\nbut there\u2019s others who might.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you don\u2019t think I had anything to do with the murder Mr. Rudge\u201d\nsaid Ware dryly.",
    "\u201cBut there\u2019s others who might\u201d repeated Rudge \u201cand will too unless you\ntell us all you know about that evening.",
    "Now come Ware.\u201d\nNeddy Ware drew a moment or two at his pipe before he spoke.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re\npretty sure it was murder eh Mr. Rudge\u201d\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s suicide do you And I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t see how\nthat knife could have got into his chest by accident.",
    "Accident suicide or murder\nit\u2019s got to be one of those three.\u201d\n\u201cOh no it hasn\u2019t\u201d retorted Ware.",
    "\u201cNot by a long chalk it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean Are you saying that the Admiral\u2019s death wasn\u2019t due to\neither accident suicide or murder\u201d\n\u201cMe I\u2019m not saying anything.",
    "That\u2019s your job to find out what the Admiral\ndied from.",
    "All I\u2019m saying is that every death isn\u2019t due to one of those three.",
    "What about hanging a man eh What\u2019s that Mr. Rudge\u2014accident suicide or\nmurder\u201d\n\u201cWell never mind that\u201d said Rudge impatiently.",
    "\u201cWhat I want to know is\nwhat did you do last Tuesday evening and where did you take the Admiral And\nI needn\u2019t repeat what I said about it being in your own interests to tell me.\u201d\nAgain Ware paused before replying so long that the Inspector began to think\nthat he was never going to reply at all but at crucial moments such as these he\nhad learnt that silent patience was the best policy.",
    "At last the old man took the pipe out of his mouth.",
    "\u201cThis woman now.",
    "What\u2019s\nall this about her They\u2019re saying she\u2019s Mr. Mount\u2019s wife and there\u2019s others\nsaying she was the Frenchy maid that the Admiral\u2019s niece had.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s both\u201d said Rudge shortly annoyed at this sidetrack but thinking it\nbest not to bustle the old man.",
    "Rudge was something of a fisherman himself.",
    "\u201cIs she That\u2019s queer now.",
    "And killed herself they say.\u201d\nWare turned round suddenly and looked full at the Inspector.",
    "\u201cIs that true Mr.\nRudge Did she kill herself What is it this time eh Accident suicide or\nmurder\u201d\n\u201cThe Super and Major Twyfitt are satisfied it\u2019s suicide\u201d said Rudge and did\nnot add that he was not.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d said Ware and returned to his pipe again.",
    "Once more the Inspector reminded himself that patience is a virtue.",
    "And then Neddy Ware did a thing which surprised his listener.",
    "He voluntarily\nreturned to the subject of his own doings.",
    "\u201cSo you want to know about me Mr.\nRudge Well seeing you know so much perhaps I\u2019d better tell you.",
    "I would\nhave told you before but it seemed better to say nothing about it in case you\nmight get foolish ideas into your head about me.",
    "That\u2019s why I said the next\nmorning I didn\u2019t know him.",
    "Well I did call for the Admiral like you said.",
    "He\u2019d\n\n\foffered me five shillings that afternoon seeing me fishing near his place to row\nhim down to Whynmouth after late dinner him not wanting to do any hard work\nwith the oars just after eating a lot you understand.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where did you take him\u201d Rudge asked eagerly.",
    "\u201cWhy where he wanted to go\u2014Whynmouth.",
    "I put him ashore at the steps\nand he asked me the quickest way to reach the Lord Marshall.",
    "And that\u2019s the last\nI see of him.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t wait for him\u201d Rudge said disappointed.",
    "\u201cI did not.",
    "He said he\u2019d be late and come back likely by motor.\u201d\n\u201cYou left the boat and walked back\u201d\n\u201cI did not.",
    "I rowed it back and put it in the boathouse for him all ship shape.\u201d\n\u201cWhich end first\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that.",
    "Probably bow.",
    "That comes easier.",
    "Why Mr. Rudge\u201d\n\u201cOh nothing.",
    "Do anything else\u201d\n\u201cI give her a bit of a swab out before I left her that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time did you get to Whynmouth\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t say for certain.",
    "\u2019Bout eleven I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you rowed the boat back nearly three miles against the tide.",
    "How long\ndid that take you\u201d\n\u201cNot much under two hours.",
    "Must have been\u2014yes nigh on one o\u2019clock your\ntime before I berthed her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you walked straight back to your cottage\u201d\n\u201cI did Mr. Rudge.",
    "And that\u2019s all I know.",
    "So I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t suspect me of\nmurdering the Admiral whatever others may think.\u201d\nRudge persevered for some little time longer but could get no further\ninformation.",
    "As he returned to his car he was not altogether satisfied with what\nhe had got.",
    "How far could Neddy Ware be trusted If one accepted his story it\nseemed proved that the man who visited the Lord Marshall that night really was\nthe Admiral and that might well be the case.",
    "But the rest of the story did not\nseem to ring quite so true.",
    "Would it be likely for instance that the Admiral\nwould saddle Ware with that twohour pull back against the tide for the sake of\nthe fortyminute run down with it It was possible of course but somehow the\nInspector had a strong feeling that it was here that Ware\u2019s story left the rails of\ntruth.",
    "He was pretty sure that the old man had not told all he knew.",
    "Why for\ninstance after getting to bed so late was he up and fishing at such an early hour\nthe next morning It almost looked as if he knew what he was going to catch.",
    "But for the present at any rate there was nothing to be done about it and at\nleast Rudge thought he might now take it as established that it was to\nWhynmouth that the Admiral had gone that night.",
    "But whom to see\n\n\fWhom but\u2014his murderer\nWalter Fitzgerald had been in Whynmouth.",
    "With any luck he had been staying\nthere and could thus be traced.",
    "It was to Whynmouth that every signpost seemed\nnow to be pointing and it was towards Whynmouth accordingly that Inspector\nRudge now headed his shabby little twoseater.",
    "7\nNevertheless his journey thither was occupied by reflections of a matter alien\nto his errand.",
    "The more he thought about it the less satisfied he was that Mrs.\nMount\u2019s death was due to suicide as the Super and Major Twyfitt were so\ncomfortably convinced.",
    "The matter of the freshlyeaten greengages was only one\nof a dozen indications slight enough in themselves but in the aggregate\nformidable that suicide had never been intended.",
    "It was quite obvious that Mrs.\nMount had been mixed up somehow in the Admiral\u2019s murder.",
    "At any rate she\nmust have known a good deal about it\u2014too much Rudge fancied for its\nperpetrator.",
    "Her suicide was really too fortunate for him to be true.",
    "And\nespecially just before that conference which she herself had summoned and at\nwhich without the smallest doubt she intended to shift at any rate some of the\nburden of knowledge from her own shoulders.",
    "Would it be likely that after\nsummoning her husband the Hollands and Sir Wilfrid Denny Mrs. Mount\nshould intend to confront them with nothing less than her own corpse That\nwould have been a grim joke indeed but Mrs. Mount had not been a grim lady.",
    "No it was altogether too lucky for Walter Fitzgerald that she should have died\nwhen she did.",
    "But how had he managed it There the Inspector had to admit himself\ncompletely at a loss.",
    "As soon as his telephone messages had brought relief he\nand the Superintendent had searched the house from attic to cellar and had\nfound nothing.",
    "Moreover he was satisfied that nobody had escaped while he was\nstill confined to the neighbourhood of the study.",
    "He had had both the front door\nand the kitchen regions continuously under his eye to say nothing of the drive.",
    "If\nWalter Fitzgerald really had done the thing he had done it exceedingly cleverly.",
    "All the way to Whynmouth the Inspector beat his brains against this stone\nwall.",
    "Nor did he have any better luck on his other errand.",
    "Though he spent the\nentire afternoon calling personally at every hotel inn publichouse and\napartmenthouse in the place no trace could he find of his bearded quarry.",
    "It\nseemed that the man had not been staying in Whynmouth at all.",
    "Well it did not really matter.",
    "The Admiral must have arranged to meet him\n\n\fthere but that did not necessarily mean that he would be staying there.",
    "It was\nquite possible to understand why the rendezvous had not been arranged for\nRundel Croft no doubt the Admiral would not have him in the place.",
    "Rudge began to regret his lack of information about this nephew.",
    "It seemed\nimpossible to get a line on the fellow from any angle.",
    "It was worse than useless\nto apply to the only person who could give any really valuable information Mrs.\nHolland.",
    "Besides in her present r\u00f4le of accessory after the fact Mrs. Holland\nherself was once more in the limelight of suspicion.",
    "The only possible hope was\nSir Wilfrid Denny.",
    "Rudge put his car up in Whynmouth and had himself ferried across the river to\nWest End.",
    "Sir Wilfrid was in his garden syringing his roses for green fly with tobacco\njuice.",
    "A rose lover himself Rudge was interested to notice now that the little\nrosegarden was the only part of the grounds which did not wear the same air of\nneglect.",
    "Sir Wilfrid greeted him with a nod.",
    "\u201cAfternoon Inspector.",
    "I was rather\nexpecting you today.",
    "Look\u2014did you ever see anything more lovely\u201d He\ncupped a halfopened Emma Wright in two fingers and turned it towards the\nInspector.",
    "\u201cBeautiful sir\u201d agreed the latter wholeheartedly.",
    "\u201cBut she loses her colour almost as soon as she opens\u201d mourned Sir Wilfrid.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of these modern roses\u2014at least I class her with the moderns.",
    "They don\u2019t keep their colour.",
    "Give me the oldfashioned ones.",
    "That pink over\nthere now.",
    "There\u2019s no modern variety to come anywhere near it in the pinks.\u201d\n\u201cMadam Abel always has been a favourite of mine\u201d Rudge nodded.",
    "Sir Wilfrid beamed up at him.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re a rose enthusiast too Inspector That\u2019s\nmagnificent.",
    "I\u2019ll take you round.",
    "This is my latest importation.",
    "Mrs. G. A. van\nRossem.",
    "Know her I can\u2019t say I\u2019m altogether satisfied.",
    "The usual mixup of\ncolours they seem to like so much nowadays.",
    "I must say I prefer my roses selfcoloured.",
    "Mabel Morse now.",
    "\u2026 Eh Don\u2019t you agree\u201d\n\u201cYes I do sir.",
    "Entirely.",
    "I think you\u2019re quite right.",
    "But to tell you the truth I\ncame to see you about something rather different.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes\u201d Sir Wilfrid nodded descending to earth.",
    "\u201cPoor Admiral Penistone.",
    "I remember you said you wanted to ask me something.",
    "Yes\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about his nephew.",
    "Walter Fitzgerald.",
    "Can you give me any information\nabout him\u201d\n\u201cWalter Fitzgerald\u201d Sir Wilfrid looked puzzled.",
    "\u201cNo I don\u2019t really think I\ncan.",
    "Of course Inspector I never knew the Admiral really well.",
    "We\u2019d been\nacquaintances for a very long time but I can\u2019t say that we ever got much beyond\n\n\fthat stage.",
    "I imagine\u201d Sir Wilfrid added with a slight smile \u201cthat few people\ndid with Admiral Penistone.\u201d\n\u201cYou were in Hong Kong when he was stationed there sir weren\u2019t you\u201d\nSir Wilfrid nodded gravely.",
    "\u201cYes I was.",
    "And when a certain incident took\nplace.",
    "But no doubt you know all about that already\u201d\n\u201cYes we\u2019ve heard about that.",
    "Did the Admiral ever refer to that incident to\nyou sir\u201d\n\u201cHe did.",
    "Frequently\u201d replied Sir Wilfrid dryly.",
    "\u201cYes I understand it was a bit of a bee in his bonnet.",
    "Do you agree with his\nidea sir that there was a good deal more behind it than ever came out\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could\u201d said Sir Wilfrid looking a little distressed.",
    "\u201cBut the facts\nwere too plain.",
    "And I happen to know the authorities made a very searching\ninvestigation.",
    "It was always my belief that this idea of Admiral Penistone\u2019s was\ndue to a kind of obstinate pride.",
    "It was his one lapse you see in a thoroughly\nhonourable life and he simply refused to face it.\u201d\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t fancy there was any possibility of the Admiral\u2019s having been\nimpersonated on that occasion\u201d\n\u201cNone.",
    "To anyone with even as little acquaintance as myself of service\nconditions the notion\u2019s simply moonshine.",
    "Why there were some of his own\nmen there.",
    "How could they have been mistaken No I\u2019m sorry to have to say so\nInspector but Captain Penistone had no one else to thank but himself for the\naffair.",
    "That was the opinion of everyone on the spot.",
    "But in any case this is all\nold history.",
    "It can\u2019t have anything to do with his death.\u201d\n\u201cNo of course not\u201d said the Inspector tactfully.",
    "\u201cThen you can\u2019t give me any\ninformation about the nephew which is what I really came to see you about\nYou knew he was in Hong Kong at about that time too\u201d\n\u201cBy Jove I remember now.",
    "Yes he did come to dine with us once.",
    "A tall\ngoodlooking fellow.",
    "I remember.",
    "Pleasant chap too.",
    "I heard he\u2019d rather gone to\nthe dogs afterwards.",
    "Pity.\u201d\n\u201cHad he a beard sir\u201d\n\u201cA beard\u201d repeated Sir Wilfrid puzzled.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think so.",
    "I don\u2019t really\nremember.",
    "Why\u201d\n\u201cOh just a small point.",
    "Then you never saw him again\u201d\n\u201cNo I think he only came once.",
    "But I wouldn\u2019t swear.",
    "We used to entertain\nsuch a lot in those days\u201d said Sir Wilfrid rather ruefully.",
    "\u201cHe might have come\nagain but I don\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\u201cI see sir.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Now there\u2019s one other point.",
    "Were you by any chance\nin the garden here last Tuesday evening\u201d\n\u201cThe night of Admiral Penistone\u2019s death Yes almost certainly though again\n\n\fI couldn\u2019t swear to it.",
    "But unless it\u2019s raining I always have a stroll round the\nroses after dinner.",
    "So far as I remember it wasn\u2019t raining that night so I expect I\ndid.",
    "Why do you ask\u201d\n\u201cBecause we have information that the Admiral landed from his boat at\nWhynmouth steps at about eleven o\u2019clock that night and as you know they\u2019re\nalmost opposite this garden.",
    "I was wondering if by any lucky chance you\u2019d seen\nhim and could confirm that\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Sir Wilfrid decidedly.",
    "\u201cNot so late as that I\u2019m afraid.",
    "And I\u2019m\npretty sure I had a couple of friends in that night.",
    "Funny isn\u2019t it how hard it is\nto say for certain what one was doing only a week ago But what\u2019s all this\nabout the Admiral being seen in Whynmouth that night I\u2019d gathered he was\nkilled upstream somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you think that sir\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know.",
    "Wasn\u2019t the boat floating downstream at four in the\nmorning I took it for granted that must have meant it had been upstream.\u201d\nWith a slightly superior air the Inspector explained the tidal vagaries of the\nRiver Whyn and pointed his remarks by accompanying Sir Wilfrid over his own\nrather dishevelled lawn to the water\u2019s edge and illustrating his meaning on the\nspot.",
    "Sir Wilfrid a somewhat mild little man had the air of promising to know\nbetter next time.",
    "Having delivered his lesson the Inspector took his leave with the unhappy\nreflection that he had really learned nothing at all from his visit.",
    "Sir Wilfrid\u2019s\nprivate opinion regarding the Superintendent\u2019s \u201csmart piece of work\u201d could\nhardly be called information.",
    "Having walked in full view of his host out through the main entrance\nInspector Rudge doubled round to the back one.",
    "There he learned after judicious\nand veiled questioning that so far as was known Sir Wilfrid had not left the\nhouse at all last Tuesday evening but had had two friends in to see him.",
    "\u201cLeastways the decanter had gone down by a tidy bit it had and there was three\nglasses to wash up the next morning to say nothing of more cigaretteends in the\nashtrays than any one man could smoke so it looks as if there was don\u2019t it\u201d\nRudge agreed that it did.",
    "As has been said before Inspector Rudge left nothing to chance.",
    "8\nRudge called in at the police station in Whynmouth before going back to his\nlodgings and found that Sergeant Appleton had telephoned through his report\nfrom London.",
    "He had had no difficulty in obtaining information about Holland.",
    "Holland it seemed was thoroughly well known in his own line.",
    "Several\nimportant men had spoken of him to Appleton in the highest not to say flowery\nterms.",
    "He was known apparently not only all over the East but in London too as\nthe very best type of trading Englishman\u2014energetic determined dead honest\nand reliable the sort of man whose word it was never necessary to obtain in\nwriting what he promised he performed and what he performed he performed\njust a shade better than anyone else.",
    "Appleton had been impressed and said so\nfrankly.",
    "About the marriage too there was no room for doubt.",
    "It had been performed at\na registry office in the West End and Appleton had inspected the register and\nspoken with the registrar who had described husband and wife exactly he had\ntaken particular notice of them he said because they were both so out of the\nordinary type.",
    "\u201cHumph\u201d said Rudge to himself.",
    "\u201cAnd yet according to the Super he\u2019s an\naccessory after.",
    "At least his wife is which almost always means the same thing.",
    "Something funny somewhere.\u201d\nHe went back to his supper.",
    "As usual he ruminated during the solitary meal.",
    "On the whole he was not\ndissatisfied with his day\u2019s work.",
    "It had not been true that he had learned nothing\nfrom Sir Wilfrid Denny.",
    "Going over the conversation again in his mind Rudge\nfancied that he had learned one thing of real value which might lead to quite\nremarkable results\u2014so remarkable indeed that when Rudge first began to\nrealise their possibilities he feared that his imagination goaded by the events of\nthe last week was running hopelessly away with him.",
    "And yet \u2026\nBut it was useless to speculate.",
    "He must shelve that line of enquiry until there\nwas evidence to support it.",
    "In the meantime he would turn his thoughts to the\ndeath of Mrs. Mount.",
    "There was one point which told badly against murder and Superintendent\nHawkesworth had of course made the most of it.",
    "According to the doctor if\nMrs. Mount had been stabbed by some other person her murderer could not\nhave escaped being spattered and liberally too with blood her clothing had\nbeen of the flimsiest it would have interposed only a feeble barrier against the\nstream of blood that must have spurted from a wound in such a position\u2014as\nindeed the condition of the carpet plainly showed.",
    "And yet not a single person so\nstained had been seen by anyone.",
    "Therefore argued the Superintendent\ncontemptuously logical no such person existed.",
    "Rudge still obstinately fixed in his idea of murder thought now that he saw a\nway round this difficulty and it was a way too which might be made to carry\nseveral other of the peculiar circumstances of the death.",
    "Perfectly simple too\n\n\fMrs. Mount had been stabbed from behind not from in front at all.",
    "And that\nargued that her murderer must be a man.",
    "But of this the Inspector was already\nconvinced.",
    "If he was right and Mrs. Mount really had been murdered the man\nwho had killed her was the same as the murderer of Admiral Penistone.",
    "Rudge\nhad no doubt at all about that.",
    "And he had killed her to close her mouth which\nshe was just about to open against him.",
    "From the weapon that usually hopeful source of enquiry nothing could be\nlearned.",
    "Mr. Mount had identified at once the knife that had been drawn from his\nwife\u2019s breast as his own a steel paperknife with a pointed end which lay\nhabitually on the desk in his study.",
    "The only argument from that fact was that\nmurder had not been intended from the first circumstances had arisen in the\ncourse of the interview that must have taken place which had made murder\nimperative.",
    "But it was not an argument on which one could really rely.",
    "As to the Superintendent\u2019s chief objection to the theory of murder namely\nthat murder was impossible since no murderer could have got away and yet no\nmurderer had been found Rudge was not disposed to bother too much about\nthat.",
    "He already had a theory to account for that.",
    "Rudge did not believe that the\nmurderer had got away at all.",
    "His meal finished he got up from the table and began to wander aimlessly\nabout the room.",
    "He felt restless.",
    "Something must be done and he did not know\nquite what.",
    "Finally he went down to his car and drove out to Rundel Croft.",
    "He\nwould smoke a quiet pipe in the boathouse looking out over the river and see if\nthat would help matters.",
    "It did but the pipe was hardly needed.",
    "Quite automatically the Inspector as\nsoon as he arrived in the boathouse cast an official eye over the Admiral\u2019s\nskiff and something took that same eye immediately.",
    "Caught in between two of\nthe planks in the bow was something of a vivid red colour.",
    "Rudge bent over it.",
    "It\nwas a head of valerian drooping and sad but not withered.",
    "\u201cHumph\u201d said Rudge.",
    "This was extremely interesting.",
    "He knew where he had seen valerian last that\nvery afternoon in Sir Wilfrid Denny\u2019s garden.",
    "There was a big clump of it\ngrowing close to the water at one end of the landingstage.",
    "And so far as Rudge\nknew there was no other on the river.",
    "But the really interesting thing was that\nthis head had not been there when the boat was examined on the morning after\nthe murder Appleton would never have missed it in any case as indeed its\ncomparatively fresh condition showed.",
    "There were only two possible inferences\none that the boat had been taken out today and had picked up the flower by\naccident and the other that the latter had been deliberately placed there.",
    "Rudge considered these for a moment then he picked the flower out.",
    "The\n\n\fstem came out in a straight line from the little crevice in which it had been\nlodged by no possible chance could it have got in there just like that as the boat\nbrushed past the clump.",
    "The second inference was the correct one somebody\nwas trying to throw suspicion upon Sir Wilfrid Denny.",
    "Rudge became very active.",
    "He knew perfectly well who had put that piece of\nvalerian in the boat.",
    "He went up tc the house.",
    "Constable Hempstead was there\ncherishing busily as usual.",
    "Rudge asked one question of the company assembled\nin the kitchen and it was Constable Hempstead who was able to answer it.",
    "\u201cHas that reporter from the Evening Gazette been up here today\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "I saw him from the other bank this morning.",
    "Near the boathouse he\nwas.\u201d\nRudge took his car drove as fast as he dared to the nearest magistrate and\nobtained a searchwarrant.",
    "Then he headed for the Lord Marshall.",
    "\u201cIs that reporter from the Evening Gazette in\u201d he asked the porter.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Graham No Mr. Rudge.",
    "He went out after dinner.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the number of his room\u201d\n\u201cSeventeen.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.",
    "No don\u2019t come up.",
    "And say nothing about this to anyone.\u201d\nThe porter nodded importantly.",
    "Rudge was busy for over half an hour undisturbed.",
    "When he left however he\nhad in his pocket nothing but a piece of paper on which he had laboriously typed\na few sentences from a portable typewriter which stood on a table near the\nwindow.",
    "As he passed unobtrusively out into the street he looked about him.",
    "On the\nother side of the road a man was lounging.",
    "Rudge nodded to him and the other\nfollowed him round a corner.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re both in\u201d he said in a low tone as he reached the Inspector.",
    "\u201cHad\ntheir dinner there and haven\u2019t been out since.\u201d Since the discovery of the bloodstained frock Mr. and Mrs. Holland had been placed by Superintendent\nHawkesworth under close observation.",
    "Rudge nodded.",
    "\u201cNever mind about them.",
    "I want you to look after somebody\nelse.",
    "That reporter chap from the Evening Gazette.",
    "Know him\u201d\n\u201cHim with the short hair and the spectacles\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Calls himself Graham.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that his real name then Mr. Rudge\u201d\n\u201cIt is not.",
    "His real name\u201d said Rudge \u201cis Walter Fitzgerald.\u201d\n\n9\n\n\f\u201cYou should have rung me up last night Rudge\u201d said Major Twyfitt severely.",
    "\u201cOr at least you should have got in touch with the Superintendent.",
    "The fellow\nmight have got away.\u201d\n\u201cI had a man at the back of the Lord Marshall as well as the front all night\nsir\u201d pleaded Rudge.",
    "The Superintendent said nothing but his look was voluble.",
    "\u201cHow long have you known this man Graham was Fitzgerald\u201d\n\u201cNot definitely till I identified that specimen of typing I took in his room as\ncoming from the same machine that typed the Admiral\u2019s consent to Mrs.\nHolland\u2019s marriage.",
    "Of course I suspected it before\u201d said Rudge with a sideglance at the Superintendent \u201cas soon as I heard about Hempstead finding those\nremains of a beard in the washbasin trap at Rundel Croft because I remembered\nthat this reporter\u2019s face was a good deal lighter round the chin than on the\nforehead.",
    "I thought at first that he\u2019d been dosing himself with some kind of\nsunburn application.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you say you rang up the Evening Gazette last night\u201d\n\u201cYes sir and he\u2019s their man all right.",
    "And he had a beard when they saw him\nlast.",
    "The editor told me he\u2019s not their real crime expert.",
    "He\u2019s ill as it happens so\nwhen Fitzgerald rang them up on the morning after the murder to tell them he\nwas on the spot and ask if he could cover it they said he could though I gather\nhe wasn\u2019t on their salarylist before.",
    "Sort of freelance contributor but they liked\nhis stuff.",
    "\u2018Graham\u2019 was the name he wrote under.\u201d\n\u201cYes that gave him an excuse to be on the spot and keep in touch with\ndevelopments of course.",
    "Very handy from his point of view.",
    "He doesn\u2019t know\nyou suspect him You\u2019re sure of that\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no reason to think he does sir.\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t\u201d said the Superintendent with energy.",
    "\u201cBecause\nif he\u2019s got wind of it and gets away\u2014well you\u2019ll be for it Rudge.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think there was enough evidence for an arrest\u201d pleaded Rudge.",
    "\u201cNot\nthen.\u201d\n\u201cBut you do now\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s for you and the Major to say\u201d replied Rudge smugly.",
    "\u201cBut I\nhaven\u2019t wasted the extra time sir I can assure you.\u201d This was no less than the\ntruth.",
    "Rudge had not got to bed at all the previous night.",
    "\u201cTell us what you\u2019ve done then man\u201d said the Superintendent impatiently.",
    "Rudge cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cPerhaps I\u2019d better run through the case as I saw it\nbefore last night more or less.",
    "I don\u2019t mean the facts.",
    "We know those.",
    "I mean\nthe ideas that the facts gave me.\u201d\nThe silence of the other two encouraged him to do so.",
    "\u201cWell first of all of course there was the question why was the Admiral\u2019s\nbody in a boat at all So much easier if you\u2019ve got a boat handy to have taken it\nout to sea and sunk it with a few weights.",
    "The only reason I could see was to\ncreate a misleading impression and the only misleading impression I could see\nwas that the body had floated downstream instead of up\u2014in other words that\nthe murder had been committed some way above Lingham.",
    "That gave me a\npointer towards a theory that it had actually been committed in Whynmouth or\nat any rate between Whynmouth and Lingham.",
    "Anyhow I concentrated on that\narea.\u201d\n\u201cEven then\u201d observed Major Twyfitt \u201cit seems a pretty poor reason for not\nsinking the body and hiding the fact of murder altogether.\u201d\n\u201cThat also occurred to me sir\u201d Rudge replied a trifle complacently.",
    "\u201cI was\nsure there was another reason and I believe I know now what it is.",
    "Old Ware put\nme on to it.",
    "I\u2019m as certain as I am of anything that he knows more than he\u2019s let\non and I\u2019m pretty certain he knows who killed the Admiral.",
    "Anyhow he\ndropped me a hint.",
    "He said how did I know it was murder\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u201d demanded the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cNot murder\u201d exclaimed the Major.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t say that sir\u201d Rudge replied quickly.",
    "\u201cWhat I do say is that old Ware\ndoesn\u2019t think it was murder.",
    "Whether it was or not of course we can\u2019t know yet\nbut I\u2019ll take my oath that\u2019s what Ware thinks.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your evidence\u201d snapped the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cNone sir.",
    "An impression only.",
    "But I know Neddy Ware pretty well and\nthough he may not be above a bit of troutpoaching and so on I\u2019d bet all I\u2019ve got\nthat he wouldn\u2019t stand for murder.",
    "And my inference is that whatever the others\nwanted to do he wouldn\u2019t stand for the body being sunk or any hankypanky.",
    "I\nbelieve the boat was his idea altogether.\u201d\n\u201cYou believe this and believe that\u201d growled the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s have a\nbit of proof.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any\u201d Rudge returned unabashed.",
    "\u201cAnd in any case I only put it\nforward as my own idea.",
    "But I do suggest sir that there may be something in it\nand if there is\u2014why it alters the case considerably.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a possibility\u201d Major Twyfitt agreed.",
    "The Superintendent seeing his murder slipping away from him only looked\nsulky.",
    "\u201cStill we must proceed as if there was no question of it being anything but\nmurder\u201d pointed out the Chief Constable.",
    "\u201cOf course sir.",
    "So I\u2019ll get on with my reconstruction.",
    "Well we had the\nAdmiral being rowed down to Whynmouth by Neddy Ware and this reporter\n\n\ffellow the nephew rowing the Vicarage boat after him about an hour later with\nMrs. Mount as his passenger.\u201d\n\u201cEh\u201d said the startled Chief Constable who did not remember having heard\nanything of the sort.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s this\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s obvious sir.",
    "I mean\u201d said Rudge with a naughty glance at his\nSuperintendent \u201cthere\u2019s evidence to that effect.",
    "We know Mrs. Mount got to the\nVicarage about eleven we know the Vicar didn\u2019t see her till well past twelve\nwe know the Vicarage boat was taken out that night we\u2019re pretty sure Fitzgerald\nhad a hand in the business we know Fitzgerald was Mrs. Mount\u2019s lover.",
    "What\u2019s\nthe result Why that Fitzgerald knowing she\u2019s coming down that night to see\nthe Vicar about the divorce intercepts her in the garden takes her to the\nsummerhouse for a talk decides they\u2019d better go down to Whynmouth after the\nAdmiral it\u2019s more than possible there was some sort of appointment between\nthe two men takes the Vicar\u2019s hat to put on in case anyone sees them going off\nin the boat nothing like a hat to establish identity takes the Norwegian knife\nthe boys left there to cut the painter with\u2014no\u201d said Rudge thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cShe\nran back for the knife when they found they couldn\u2019t untie the knot.\u201d\n\u201cHow the devil do you know that\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know it sir.",
    "But if she did it would explain a lot.",
    "It\u2019s always puzzled\nme that the Vicar was watering his garden so hard the next day in the blazing\nsun.",
    "Mr. Mount can\u2019t be such a bad gardener as all that.",
    "But suppose she\u2019d left\nfootprints on the beds when she ran back for the knife.",
    "A nice strong jet of water\nwould destroy them and so much less obvious than a fork or a trowel the\ngarden being under observation all the time by our men in the Admiral\u2019s boathouse.",
    "And he even gave the inside of the summerhouse a bit of a splashing.",
    "Suppose she left powder scattered about there like they do\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility\u201d the Chief Constable agreed with interest.",
    "\u201cMore than a\npossibility.\u201d\nThe Superintendent said nothing.",
    "\u201cWell anyhow as I said we have Fitzgerald chasing after the Admiral.",
    "It\nwould take him half an hour to forty minutes I suppose to get down to\nWhynmouth.",
    "Then there\u2019s a gap of say fifteen or twenty minutes during which\nthe Admiral is killed and arrangements made about the two boats.",
    "The body is\ndumped in the Vicarage one the two painters tied together and someone rows\nthem upstream.",
    "Who Not Fitzgerald.",
    "He wouldn\u2019t have time we\u2019ve got him at\nRundel Croft soon after twelve.",
    "Not Mrs. Mount she\u2019s at the Vicarage at about\nthe same time.\u201d\n\u201cWare\u201d nodded the Chief Constable.",
    "\u201cYes that seems clear.\u201d\nThe Superintendent said nothing.",
    "\u201cNeddy Ware sir yes\u201d said Rudge who was now very much enjoying\nhimself.",
    "\u201cAnd cuts the two painters again when he arrives at Rundel Croft a\ncouple of hours later with his own knife which isn\u2019t so sharp as the Norwegian\none.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a naval man\u201d demurred the Major \u201cto cut a painter\ninstead of untying it.\u201d\n\u201cBut supposing it wasn\u2019t a naval man who tied it sir Suppose it was a\nlandsman with a ridiculous knot which the dragging in the water had made\ntighter still.",
    "Besides it\u2019s my opinion that old Ware was in the sort of mood then\nwhen one does cut instead of untying even a naval man.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u201d assented the Chief Constable.",
    "\u201cGo on.\u201d\nThe Superintendent said nothing.",
    "\u201cFitzgerald must have come back by car on the Whynmouth side of the river\nto drop Mrs. Mount at the Vicarage for her interview.",
    "And he parked the car\nwhile he was over at Rundel Croft.",
    "I made a bit of a bloomer over that sir.",
    "I\u2019d\nsuspected he must have a car but seeing he himself was at Rundel Croft I\u2019d only\nhad enquiries made that side of the river.",
    "As soon as Sergeant Appleton got back\nlast night I sent him off to work the other side.",
    "He\u2019s found two witnesses who\nsaw a car with the lights out standing just inside the Vicarage gate behind the\nlaurels out of sight of the road one at twelvefifteen and one at twelveforty.\u201d\n\u201cHow could they have seen it if it was out of sight of the road\u201d\n\u201cHow do people in the country see so much sir They\u2019ll have some plausible\nexplanation you can be sure.",
    "But you know as well as I do that if it had been\nparked in the Vicar\u2019s cellar with a tarpaulin over it someone would have seen it\nthere.",
    "And very handy for us too.\u201d\nMajor Twyfitt laughed.",
    "\u201cAll right.",
    "How did Fitzgerald get across the river\nthen\u201d\n\u201cHe must have swum it.",
    "No other way.",
    "I suggest he stripped quickly rolled\nhis clothes up in his coat tossed the bundle across the stream it\u2019s not more than\nforty feet wide there and swum after it.",
    "And there he was looking for File X as\ncomfortable as you like and his sister helping him when along comes Holland\nand taps at the french windows.",
    "That must have given both of them a nasty\nshock.",
    "But he rose to it.",
    "Muttered to her to get rid of him at once kept himself in\nthe shadow and handed over the typed consent to their marriage.",
    "That was quite\nenough to send Holland half off his head with pleasure\u2014far too much to have\nany room in his mind for noticing how young the Admiral was looking\nnowadays.",
    "Then Fitzgerald gets the papers destroys them goes upstairs and\nshaves off his beard crosses the river again picks up Mrs. Mount and goes off\nwith her in the car.",
    "I haven\u2019t been able to trace where they went but I expect\n\n\fthey made for London\u2014as far away as they could.\u201d\n\u201cThen you think Holland was genuine in his identification of the Admiral that\nnight\u201d\n\u201cI do sir.",
    "Mind you I think he knows the truth now all right but he didn\u2019t\nthen.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes him an accessory after too.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "Though it seems likely that he\u2019s been told the same tale as Neddy\nWare was\u2014that it wasn\u2019t murder.",
    "And Mrs. Holland too.",
    "That would explain\nwhy she didn\u2019t seem surprised the first time I saw her to hear that her uncle was\ndead but she did jump when I said he\u2019d been murdered.\u201d\n\u201cThat fits very well Rudge\u201d commended Major Twyfitt.",
    "The Superintendent said at last \u201cHave you found the weapon\u201d\n\u201cNo sir\u201d said Rudge.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d said the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cBut I found this.\u201d Rudge produced from his breastpocket a strip of brown\npaper.",
    "Unwrapping it he brought to light a long slender Norwegian knife rather\nrusty.",
    "The Superintendent took it eagerly.",
    "\u201cThen you have found the weapon.\u201d\n\u201cNo sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you find it Rudge\u201d interposed Major Twyfitt.",
    "\u201cIn a clump of antirrhinums in the Vicar\u2019s garden sir.\u201d\n\u201cWere you looking for it there\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "There was a nice bright moon last night.\u201d\n\u201cWhy Rudge\u201d asked the Chief Constable patiently \u201cwere you looking for\nthis knife in a clump of antirrhinums last night in the Vicar\u2019s garden\u201d\n\u201cWell sir you see I\u2019d worked it out this way.",
    "Was the crime premeditated or\nwas it not Somehow what with Ware\u2019s remarks and the rest I didn\u2019t think it\nwas.",
    "Anyhow I could soon test it.",
    "If Fitzgerald had intended to murder the\nAdmiral that night he would have taken this knife along with him because he\u2019d\nhave known as soon as he saw it that nothing would serve him better.",
    "If he\nhadn\u2019t the intention I thought he might most probably have thrown it back into\nthe garden as soon as he\u2019d used it on the painter.",
    "So I had a look round Mr.\nMount\u2019s ground last night within an easy throw of his mooringpost.\u201d Rudge by\nthis time was so pleased with himself that he could not resist sending a highly\nunofficial beam at his superior officer.",
    "Major Twyfitt smiled back.",
    "\u201cSmart bit of work Rudge.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I want\u201d observed the Superintendent unappeased \u201cis the weapon.\u201d\n\u201cI found this too sir.\u201d\n\n\fRudge produced another piece of brown paper from his pocket and from it\nanother knife an ordinary jackknife such as sailors and navvies use.",
    "\u201cThere are\nno prints on it\u201d he said as he laid it on the table.",
    "\u201cAnd where did you find that\u201d\n\u201cIn a clump of valerian sir at the bottom of Sir Wilfrid Denny\u2019s garden\noverhanging the river.\u201d\n\u201cSir Wilfrid Denny\u2019s garden\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "It\u2019s like this.\u201d Rudge gave an account of his finding of the sprig of\nvalerian stuck into the Admiral\u2019s boat which had not been there when Sergeant\nAppleton overhauled it.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s like those treasurehunts\u201d he added \u201cwhere you go\nfrom one clue to another.",
    "That valerian was a clue so I followed it up and that\u2019s\nwhat I found.",
    "It\u2019s a plant.",
    "There\u2019s not even any blood on the knife only rust.",
    "Of\ncourse the real weapon\u2019s at the bottom of the sea.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so\u201d\n\u201cRivers\u201d said Rudge \u201ccan be dragged.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think that Fitzgerald planted these two clues\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m certain of it sir.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time\u201d remarked the Superintendent \u201cthat we got our hooks on\nMaster Fitzgerald.\u201d\nRudge glanced at the clock.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m expecting him at eleventhirty.",
    "Another\nfifteen minutes to go.",
    "I told him I\u2019d have an exclusive piece of information for\nhim if he came along then.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll come\u201d said the Chief Constable doubtfully.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re\ntaking a risk\u201d\n\u201cSergeant Appleton\u2019s tailing him in any case sir.\u201d\n\u201cIf Fitzgerald gets away Rudge\u201d growled Superintendent Hawkesworth.",
    "\u201cHe won\u2019t sir.",
    "Is there anything else you want me to report on before he\ncomes\u201d\n\u201cHave you traced that copy of the evening paper in his pocket\u201d\n\u201cNo sir.",
    "He must have picked it up in Whynmouth perhaps at the Lord\nMarshall.",
    "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much importance to be attached to it.\u201d\n\u201cYou think now then that it was the Admiral who went to the Lord\nMarshall\u201d asked Major Twyfitt.",
    "\u201cI do sir.",
    "I know the Superintendent thought differently but we\u2019ve proved he\nwas in Whynmouth so why shouldn\u2019t it have been him It\u2019s my notion that he\nanticipated danger at the interview ahead of him and wanted to take Holland\nalong to stand by but when the porter told him Holland was in bed he didn\u2019t\nbother to have him roused and just gave the first excuse that came into his head.",
    "Of course he never intended to catch a train at all but he had to say something.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cHumph\u201d said the Superintendent not too pleased at having his bright idea\nsnatched from him by a mere inspector.",
    "\u201cAnd the doorkey in the Admiral\u2019s boat\u201d asked the Major.",
    "\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t the Admiral have dropped it there himself sir It seems a\npity\u201d said Rudge \u201cto bother to find complicated explanations when there\u2019s a\nsimple one handy.",
    "I felt that\u201d he added with a look of great innocence \u201cabout\nthe Admiral\u2019s visit to the Lord Marshall though I know Mr. Hawkesworth\ndidn\u2019t agree with me.\u201d\nMr. Hawkesworth\u2019s large face looked for a moment so suffused with honest\nemotion that the Chief Constable hurriedly led the conversation into quite a\ndifferent track.",
    "\u201cAnd Mrs. Mount\u2019s death Rudge Have you got any further with your theory\nof murder there\u201d\n\u201cNot so far as evidence goes sir\u201d Rudge said slowly \u201cbut I could put a case\nof murder for you if you\u2019d care to hear it though I know well enough we could\nnever put it before a jury as it stands.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d\n\u201cIf it was murder sir it was done this way.",
    "Mrs. Mount makes this\nappointment.",
    "She\u2019s lost her nerve and she\u2019s going to give things away.",
    "The\nHollands know a good deal already she\u2019s going to tell them more.",
    "I don\u2019t know\nhow much the Reverend knows but he\u2019s going to know a good deal more by the\ntime she\u2019s finished.",
    "Naturally this doesn\u2019t suit a certain person\u2019s book.",
    "He gets\nwind of it and goes there to stop her.",
    "He must have reached the house just\nbefore I got there myself.",
    "She lets him in and they start arguing.",
    "Suddenly they\nsee me coming up the drive.",
    "He snatches up the steel paperknife from the desk\nand threatens her with it if she utters a sound.",
    "She keeps quiet.",
    "They watch me\nhide in the laurels.",
    "Then an hour or so later along come the Hollands and he\ndoes the same thing.",
    "They sit on the lawn and the situation\u2019s saved for another\nfew minutes.",
    "But he\u2019s getting badly rattled and she\u2019s probably nearing hysteria.",
    "He doesn\u2019t trust her one inch.",
    "All the time while the three of us are out there\nhe\u2019s got to keep the knife at her breast to make sure of her silence.",
    "And what\ndoes he do He makes her hold it there herself both hands on the hilt and the\npoint right on her heart with one hand over hers he can control her more easily\nlike that and use his eyes elsewhere.",
    "She\u2019s halfdead with fright of him\u2014sees he\nmeans murder\u2014does whatever he tells her.",
    "Then the Hollands come up to the\nhouse again.",
    "From their conversation he learns that the front door which he\ncan\u2019t have shut properly has blown ajar.",
    "They\u2019re coming in.",
    "He hears them go\ninto the drawingroom and then into the diningroom he knows they\u2019re bound\nto come into the study.",
    "It\u2019s his life or hers now.",
    "What does he do He\u2019s behind\n\n\fMrs. Mount now both his hands over hers on the hilt of the dagger.",
    "With a\nconvulsive pull he forces the thing into her heart.",
    "She screams once.",
    "He drops\nher and darts behind the door wiping his hands on his handkerchief.",
    "In come the\nHollands Mrs. runs out Holland stays a moment then follows her out of the\nhouse.",
    "I\u2019m on my way across the lawn.",
    "The murderer\u2019s got a couple of seconds\nto get inside the lavatory just by the front door.",
    "He does it.",
    "But he can\u2019t leave the\ngrounds in case he\u2019s seen.",
    "So then\u201d concluded Rudge somewhat breathlessly\n\u201call he\u2019s got to do is to wait till the coast\u2019s clear creep out of the house hide\nround the angle of it scuffle on the gravel and walk in again.",
    "And that sir is\njust what I suggest he did do.\u201d\nThere was a silence after Rudge had finished.",
    "Superintendent Hawkesworth broke it by remarking quite mildly \u201cCan you\nprove he didn\u2019t come up the drive What about those two on the lawn\u201d\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t see from where they were.",
    "The angle of the house is in the\nway.\u201d\n\u201cBesides they wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d\nThere was another silence.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Hawkesworth\u201d said Rudge a little diffidently \u201cwho is to make the\narrest you or I\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better.",
    "You\u2019ve put in some very good work on this case\u201d said the\nSuperintendent who after all was a fair man \u201cand I think you ought to have the\ncredit of it.",
    "The one who makes the arrest always gets the credit.",
    "That is\u201d he\nadded rather perfunctorily \u201cif Major Twyfitt agrees.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly certainly\u201d said that gentleman.",
    "\u201cI quite agree.",
    "Rudge has done\nvery well.",
    "Saved us a lot of trouble to say nothing of Scotland Yard.\u201d\n\u201cThank you sir\u201d said Rudge modestly and looked at the clock.",
    "The time was\nclose on halfpast eleven.",
    "\u201cWell I suppose we can only wait\u201d said the Chief Constable.",
    "All three were\nbeginning to feel uneasy.",
    "They did not have to wait long.",
    "Before the hands of the clock had reached the\nappointed time a constable put his head round the door to announce in a\nstentorian whisper that Mr. Graham was there to see Mr. Rudge by\nappointment.",
    "\u201cShow him in\u201d nodded the Major.",
    "The croppedheaded reporter entered with no less than his usual assurance\ngreeting the three heartily and receiving three very curt nods in exchange.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s this Inspector\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSomething rather special for me That\u2019s very\ndecent of you.\u201d\n\u201cSomething very special\u201d replied Rudge dryly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going to make an arrest.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAn arrest\u201d Fitzgerald stared at him.",
    "\u201cOh For Admiral Penistone\u2019s death\u201d\n\u201cFor Admiral Penistone\u2019s murder\u201d returned Rudge grimly.",
    "\u201cAnd something\nelse.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "Er\u2014very good of you to let me in on it.\u201d The reporter\u2019s assurance was\nnot so pronounced now.",
    "Without being asked he sat down in a chair as if his legs\nhad suddenly gone weak.",
    "The three others eyed him in silence.",
    "Again the constable put his head round the door.",
    "\u201cSir Wilfrid Denny to see\nMr. Rudge by appointment.\u201d\n\u201cShow him in Gravestock\u201d said Rudge.",
    "To his superiors he said briefly as he\nrose from his chair \u201cI asked Sir Wilfrid to be good enough to come down here\nhimself so that we could ask him about\u2014certain things.\u201d\nThe others nodded.",
    "Rudge went to the door to meet Sir Wilfrid.",
    "Sir Wilfrid however was already\nin the doorway as Rudge reached it.",
    "Rudge was a large man Sir Wilfrid a small\none.",
    "It was Sir Wilfrid who sprawled on the floor.",
    "With every sign of\nembarrassment and apologising heartily Rudge helped him up and brushed him\ndown.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir.",
    "Most sorry.",
    "Very careless of me.",
    "Do you know Major Twyfitt\nAnd Superintendent Hawkesworth I\u2019m so sorry to have brought you down here\nsir but there were just one or two questions we wanted to ask you to clear up a\ndoubtful point.",
    "It\u2019s about a sprig of valerian that was found wedged between two\nof the boards of Admiral Penistone\u2019s boat.",
    "Now I\u2019ve searched up and down the\nriver and the only clump of valerian growing close to the water is in your\ngarden.",
    "We were wondering if you could account for the sprig in any way\u201d\nSir Wilfrid thrust his hands into his jacket pockets and stared at Rudge with\nperplexity.",
    "\u201cNo I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNor for this knife found in the same clump of valerian with traces of blood\non it\u201d\nSir Wilfrid looked at Major Twyfitt he looked at Superintendent\nHawkesworth he looked at Walter Fitzgerald.",
    "Then he coughed.",
    "\u201cI never saw it\nbefore\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThank you sir.",
    "That\u2019s all I had to ask you.",
    "And now I have a very painful\nduty to perform.\u201d\nRudge paused and looked hard at Sir Wilfrid.",
    "Sir Wilfrid coughed again\nmore rackingly.",
    "\u201cSir Wilfrid Denny\u201d said Rudge \u201cI arrest you for the murders of Hugh\nLawrence Penistone and Celia Mount and I warn you that anything you say may\nbe used in evidence against you.\u201d\n\n\f10\n\u201cHardly I think\u201d replied Sir Wilfrid dryly.",
    "\u201cWell I congratulate you\nInspector.",
    "How did you find out\u201d He sat with an air of jauntiness on the edge\nof the table.",
    "\u201cLook here Denny\u201d interposed Major Twyfitt awkwardly as he and\nSuperintendent Hawkesworth emerged slowly from the stupor into which they\nseemed to have fallen.",
    "\u201cLook here I don\u2019t know whether \u2026 I mean better not\nsay anything.",
    "Your solicitor \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know perfectly well what I\u2019m doing\u201d returned Sir Wilfrid.",
    "\u201cHe gave me\naway I suppose\u201d He nodded towards Fitzgerald who had not moved from his\nchair.",
    "\u201cAm I to understand that you wish to make a statement Sir Wilfrid\u201d put in\nRudge suavely though there seemed little ground for such an understanding.",
    "\u201cYes I\u2019ll make a statement certainly.",
    "I killed both of them I\u2019ll tell you that at\nonce.",
    "I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s any good adding it but I didn\u2019t mean to kill the\nAdmiral at least I suppose I did but it was in selfdefence.",
    "He went for me with\na poker.\u201d\nAt the table the Superintendent had grabbed a piece of paper and was writing\nfuriously.",
    "\u201cThen why did you kill Mrs. Mount when you thought she was going to give\nyou away\u201d asked Rudge.",
    "\u201cReally Rudge\u201d said the Chief Constable unhappily.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should\nask \u2026 Sir Wilfrid really should see his solicitor.\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll answer any questions.",
    "Why did I kill her Because I didn\u2019t want to\nbe arrested of course.",
    "How could I have proved selfdefence When the\ncircumstances came out it would look as if I had every motive for murder.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean your share in the Hong Kong business\u201d\n\u201cI see you know all about it.",
    "Yes.",
    "But I\u2019m sorry about Mrs. Mount.",
    "I\u2014I\nsuppose I lost my head.",
    "Gave way to panic.",
    "Horrible thing to do\u2014I suppose\u201d he\nadded in a low voice to Walter Fitzgerald \u201cit\u2019s no good telling you that I\u2019m\nready to make amends with my own life\u201d\nFitzgerald got up without answering and crossing to the mantelpiece leaned\nhis head on his hands.",
    "\u201cBetter get this down quickly\u201d said Sir Wilfrid to the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cWe\nhaven\u2019t much time.",
    "The Admiral had suspected for some time my share in the\nHong Kong business.",
    "Somehow or other I managed to stave him off.",
    "Then Ware\nratted on me.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWare\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "He\u2019d known all along\u2014though how the devil he found out I never\ndiscovered.",
    "That\u2019s why he settled here when he retired.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d been blackmailing you\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose you\u2019d call it that but only a matter of a present of a pound or\ntwo now and then and he never used any threats.",
    "He just knew and I gave him a\nfew pounds occasionally to keep his knowledge to himself.",
    "That\u2019s all.",
    "But the\nAdmiral got hold of him and whether he paid more or appealed to \u2018duty\u2019 and\n\u2018honour\u2019 and the rest I can\u2019t say but Ware must have ratted.",
    "Then the Admiral\ncame down to see me breathing as you may imagine flames and death.",
    "He got\nme in a corner till I couldn\u2019t persist in my denials any longer.",
    "Then he must\nhave seen red because he simply went for me cold blind with the poker.",
    "I\nsnatched up the first thing I could as a matter of fact it was a trench dagger one\nof my nephews once gave me as a War souvenir dodged under the poker and\ngot in first.",
    "Then I went down to where Ware was waiting with the Admiral\u2019s\nboat and found that Fitzgerald and Mrs. Mount had just arrived in another boat.\u201d\n\u201cOne minute Sir Wilfrid\u201d interrupted the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cWhat time was\nthat\u201d\n\u201cOh I suppose about twenty minutes to twelve.",
    "I told them what I\u2019d done and\nthat we must get rid of the body.",
    "I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d lost my head a bit because I\nwouldn\u2019t listen to them when Ware and Fitzgerald both urged me to come out in\nthe open and ring up the police.",
    "It was justifiable homicide they said and\nnothing could happen to me.",
    "But I knew that if I did all that Hong Kong\nbusiness would come out and I should lose my pension in any case and I\nthought it almost inevitable that I should have to face a charge of murder.",
    "In the\nend Fitzgerald agreed to stand by me but we had a lot more trouble before we\ncould persuade Ware.",
    "Finally he agreed that if he wasn\u2019t to be expected to tell\nany direct lies except to conceal the fact of his having been out with the Admiral\nthat night at all he wouldn\u2019t give me away he would just know nothing.",
    "I was\ntoo upset to make any arrangements at all as no doubt he\u2019s told you Fitzgerald\nsaw to our plans.",
    "Ware insisted that the body should not be concealed\neverything was to be as plain and above board as it could be so we went up to\nthe house had a stiff drink apiece and put the body in the Vicar\u2019s boat covered\nwith a bit of tarpaulin.",
    "Ware undertook to tow it upstream and set it adrift\nbefore returning the Admiral\u2019s boat to its boathouse.",
    "In the meantime Fitzgerald\npromised to go at once to Rundel Croft and look through the Admiral\u2019s papers\nto destroy anything he might have in writing against me which I understand he\ndid.",
    "The next day feeling unable to stay and face it I frankly took to my heels\nand escaped to Paris.",
    "Fitzgerald sent me word there that no suspicion seemed to\n\n\fbe directed against me so I came back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Mrs. Mount\u201d\nIn a low voice Sir Wilfrid gave the details.",
    "They turned out to be almost\nexactly as Rudge had surmised except that he maintained that there again he had\nnever really intended murder.",
    "Mrs. Mount hearing the Hollands actually in the\nnext room had made a desperate attempt to escape and in the struggle Sir\nWilfrid had mechanically tightened his grasp on her and so driven the knife in.",
    "There had been no set plan in his subsequent movements.",
    "He had just run in\nsheer panic from one hiding place to another as opportunity offered.",
    "He had nothing else to say.",
    "Major Twyfitt shook his head.",
    "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you say anything until\nyou\u2019d seen your solicitor.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d returned Sir Wilfrid almost happily \u201cdon\u2019t bother.",
    "I shall\nnever face a judge.",
    "You heard me cough just before your man arrested me\nUnder cover of the second one I slipped something into my mouth which I\nbought for just such an emergency in Paris.",
    "I\u2019ve got about ten minutes more to\nlive I reckon.\u201d\nMajor Twyfitt sprang forward in consternation as did the Superintendent.",
    "It is\na bad thing for the police when a prisoner succeeds in committing suicide under\ntheir noses.",
    "Rudge however got there first.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d he said \u201cwe\u2019ll put you in safety for\nthat ten minutes anyhow.",
    "Will you come with me please\u201d Taking the other by\nthe arm he led him from the room.",
    "When he returned the Superintendent was telephoning frantically for a doctor\nwho was out.",
    "\u201cPut him in a cell\u201d he said briefly.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t worry sir.",
    "We don\u2019t\nneed a doctor.",
    "I knew what he\u2019d got in his lefthand coat pocket.",
    "I expected it.",
    "So I made up another similar packet and changed them during that collision.",
    "Here\u2019s his.\u201d Rudge produced a small twist of white paper.",
    "\u201cBut how did you know what his packet looked like\u201d asked the Chief\nConstable.",
    "\u201cI did a bit of spying on Sir Wilfrid last night sir through the blinds of his\nsittingroom.",
    "I saw him making it up and I guessed what it was and I knew it\nwas his lefthand pocket because he had his hand in it when he came in.",
    "Sir\nWilfrid\u2019s just swallowed three tablets of bicarbonate of soda that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n11\nMajor Twyfitt dropped back into his chair.",
    "Everyone seemed to have forgotten\nWalter Fitzgerald who still stood by the mantelpiece in a dejected attitude.",
    "\u201cYou knew last night it was Denny\u201d\n\u201cNot to say knew sir.",
    "I\u2019d suspected it for some time ever since I interviewed\nhim in his rosegarden.",
    "He seemed very eager to volunteer that he hardly knew\nthe Admiral at all and then for a gentleman who lived right on the river he\nseemed to know very little about the tides I couldn\u2019t quite swallow that.",
    "Then\nthere were those rumours about bad blood between him and the Admiral and\nwhat with him having been in Hong Kong at the time I thought he might\npossibly be mixed up in that business on the wrong side besides he was a bit\ntoo strong against the Admiral having been an innocent party.",
    "And though he\nremembered that Mr. Fitzgerald was handsome he couldn\u2019t remember whether\nhe had a beard or not.\u201d\n\u201cThen you were pulling our legs this morning when you told us all your\nsuspicions were directed against\u2014someone else\u201d\n\u201cSir I never told you.",
    "I didn\u2019t mention any name.",
    "I was quite sure in my own\nmind that it was Denny but what was the good of saying so I hadn\u2019t any real\nevidence.",
    "At first I thought of arresting\u2014someone else in Sir Wilfrid\u2019s presence\nwith the idea that if he had done it he\u2019d say so there and then.",
    "But that mightn\u2019t\nhave come off.",
    "Then last night when I saw him making up that packet I knew\nfor certain it was him so I thought I\u2019d take a chance and arrest him.",
    "If it came\noff well and good.",
    "If it didn\u2019t \u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d have been broken\u201d said the Superintendent with severity.",
    "\u201cBut it did sir.",
    "I thought somehow it would\u201d admitted Rudge \u201cif Sir Wilfrid\nthought he\u2019d got the contents of that packet safe inside him.\u201d\n\u201cVery unofficial Rudge\u201d pronounced the Chief Constable.",
    "\u201cMost\nunprofessional.",
    "But dam\u2019 smart.\u201d\n\u201cThank you sir.\u201d\n\u201cSo now what about Mr. Fitzgerald here I think we\u2019d like to ask him a few\nquestions.\u201d\n\u201cFire away\u201d said Walter turning round.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything you want to\nknow.",

    "Mrs. Mount as the days went\nby had been more and more vehement that Denny should give himself up and\nhad even divulged some of the facts to her husband under the seal of confession\nhe had promised to join her in urging both Sir Wilfrid and Ware to go frankly to\n\n\fthe police and tell them the truth.",
    "Holland had been an innocent party all the time.",

    "\u201cYou know about that Well then yes.\u201d\nThis charge prevented him from making himself known in England and\nconsequently from obtaining his inheritance.",
    "Holland promised to see what he\ncould do.",
    "He interviewed the firm in Hong Kong who undertook in view of the\ntime that had elapsed to withdraw the charge if Walter repaid the money.",
    "This\nhe could not do until he had received his inheritance and he refused to allow\nHolland to lend him the money a considerable sum.",
    "Holland had therefore\nundertaken to get in touch with the Admiral in England and try and bring about a\nreconciliation so that the money could be advanced by the family at the same\ntime he promised to see Elma and assure her that everything was coming right at\nlast.",
    "While abroad Walter had always kept in touch with Elma and when the\nAdmiral tried to stop her communicating with him Mrs. Mount had gone to the\nhouse as Elma\u2019s maid both to keep a roof over her head and to act as a liaison.",
    "The Admiral received Holland with suspicion as a friend of Walter\u2019s and at\nfirst would have nothing to do with him.",
    "Holland saw that it would take time to\nmake him change his attitude and settled down to play him as patiently as he\ncould.",
    "In the meantime having seen Elma he promptly fell in love with her.",
    "It was now Walter\u2019s turn to do Holland a favour.",
    "He had arrived in England\nand taken lodgings in London.",
    "Mrs. Mount hurried up too and he installed her\nnear him under the name of Arkwright.",
    "Walter was delighted to hear of\nHolland\u2019s feeling for Elma for knowing himself he had always feared that\nElma unless she became attached to somebody of strong character might\nbecome a drifter too.",
    "He had strongly urged Elma who was by no means in love\nherself to accept Holland.",
    "Finally seeing how much her brother wished it Elma\nconsented to do so.",
    "The Admiral however still proved an obstacle.",
    "He would\nnot give his consent to Elma\u2019s marriage with any friend of Walter\u2019s.",
    "Holland had\nalready improved his standing but the Admiral was by no means won over.",
    "In the meantime Elma too was trying to do something for Walter.",
    "He and Mrs.\nMount had always wanted to get married but the Vicar would not divorce her.",
    "Elma had fancied that Mr. Mount had shown signs of being interested in herself.",
    "She deliberately set about strengthening this interest in order to be able to use\nher influence with him to persuade him to agree to the divorce.",
    "It was for this\nreason that she always took particular trouble with her appearance whenever she\nwas to meet him.",
    "Walter did not know of this at the time but Holland observed\nwith pain his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s decided set at the Vicar the reason for which she did not\ngive him.",
    "He therefore told Walter that he had come to the end of his patience\nhe was going up to London to get a special licence and he was going to use it\nconsent from the Admiral or no consent.",
    "He went.",
    "Walter knew that this would put the Admiral\u2019s back up more than ever and\nElma would certainly lose the control of her money.",
    "He was aware from his\nsister of his uncle\u2019s obsession with regard to the Hong Kong incident and\nresolved to use this in order to obtain consent to the marriage.",
    "He therefore typed\nout the form of consent and taking his courage in his hands went to see his\nuncle shortly after tea on the day of his death lying in wait for him in the\ngarden so as to keep their meeting secret.",
    "It was the first time he had seen the Admiral for many years and at first the\nlatter refused to have anything to do with him.",
    "When Walter said however that\nhe could tell him the exact truth about the Hong Kong episode the Admiral\nchanged his tune.",
    "Walter then put his proposition the truth in exchange for the\nconsent.",
    "The Admiral did not hesitate he signed on the spot.",
    "Thereupon Walter\ntold him everything.",
    "He had to sacrifice Denny to do so but after all Denny was\na criminal he had grossly tricked Walter and Elma\u2019s marriage to say nothing of\nHolland\u2019s happiness could no longer be jeopardised to save Denny\u2019s face.",
    "The Admiral was beside himself with rage.",
    "He raved he swore he thundered\nhe stamped.",
    "With the very greatest difficulty Walter calmed him down and made\nhim promise to behave at the Vicar\u2019s as if nothing had happened at all.",
    "In the\nend however the Admiral had given this promise and had departed to dress\nbreathing fiery vengeance for the morrow.",
    "Walter had intended to go across first thing the next morning to West End to\nwarn Denny it never occurred to him that the Admiral would do anything that\nnight.",
    "Concealed however in the Vicar\u2019s garden where he had an appointment\nwith Mrs. Mount he had seen the Admiral set out with Ware whom doubtless\nhe had intended to pump on the way and was perturbed.",
    "He felt he must wait till\nMrs. Mount came and then talking it over decided that they should both go\ndown the river and put off the interview with the Vicar till they got back this did\nnot matter as there was no appointment a surprise assault having been intended\non the Vicar\u2019s conscience.",
    "The details of their departure had been exactly as\nRudge had said.",
    "The rest they had heard from Denny himself.",
    "When Walter got back to Rundel\nCroft he had broken the news to his sister that their uncle had been accidentally\nkilled.",
    "She was shocked but pulled herself together and helped him look for the\npapers.",
    "\u201cThere was blood on her dress\u201d said the Superintendent.",
    "\u201cSo she told me afterwards.",
    "It must have come from my hand.",
    "Anything\nelse\u201d\n\u201cThe valerian\u201d asked Rudge.",
    "Walter nodded.",

    "\u201cLook here\u201d said the Superintendent suddenly.",
    "\u201cWhat was behind that Hong\nKong incident It was you impersonating your uncle I suppose\u201d\nWalter flushed.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "This is what happened.",
    "Denny had me to dinner one\nnight and made me rather drunk.",
    "He suggested it would be a rag if I put on a\nnaval uniform which he happened to have handy and went down to some dive\nand did a songanddance somebody might mistake me for my uncle and it\nwould be a glorious joke.",

    "I thought it was fishy but I was frightened and agreed to keep quiet.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t come on the truth for years afterwards and then only by chance.",

    "Holland decides to have it out with the Admiral then and there.",
    "He\nstarts to walk to Rundel Croft sees a car standing near the entrance and decides\nto go round via the Vicarage.",
    "For the whole business is somewhat fishy and he\nhas no wish to be seen.",
    "His anxiety not to attract notice retards his progress.",
    "To\nhis horror he finds the body in the Vicar\u2019s boat it is by now about two o\u2019clock.",

    "He must wait for\nthe turn.",
    "The waiting is anxious work he gets more and more jumpy and more\nand more anxious to clear off.",
    "At about three o\u2019clock the tide is slackening.",
    "He\ncuts the painter\u2014not because he cannot reach to untie the knot but because to\ncut it suits his state of mind\u2014it seems quicker than untying a knot.",
    "Then he\nthinks of fingerprints and throws the knife into the river.",

    "The \u201cfavourite frock\u201d was never hidden.",
    "But it was a favourite and\ntherefore suitable for the occasion in London and for the same reason Elma\nhesitated to let her new and untried maid pack it for her in the suitcase.",
    "She\nfolded it herself put it on a shelf and packed it on top after seeing the Inspector.",
    "As to her regard for her appearance\u2014she like some others took more trouble\nbefore strangers than before intimates she had no time in the Inspector\u2019s case of\ncourse.",

    "Denny soon found that the\nprice of this \u201caccommodation\u201d was to be the turning of a blind eye to the\npassage of opium through the customs.",
    "This brought him into contact with\nWalter who soon saw himself in a position to blackmail the weak and foolish\nDenny.",
    "Denny was then about forty years of age.",
    "In 1911 the Captain in command of the cruiser Huntingdonshire stationed at\nHong Kong was Captain Penistone young Fitzgerald\u2019s uncle and to get the\nJOHN MARTIN FITZGERALD\n\n\fopium through meant getting it past Penistone.",

    "Or it is just\npossible that Mrs. Mount did know but deliberately didn\u2019t tell Walter at first\nbecause she was bitten with the idea of getting a sight of her two boys.",
    "Perhaps\nthis latter idea makes the thing more credible and more suitable to Mrs. Mount\u2019s\nweakly emotional character.",
    "The Vicar of course sees and recognises his wife and is greatly shocked.",
    "He\nhas an interview with her in private in which he regains a good deal of his old\ninfluence over her as a priest at least if not as a man.",

    "Mrs. Mount always readily accessible to the\nlatest influence becomes very much troubled after this interview.",
    "Moreover\nfrom what she hears at the Admiral\u2019s she begins to fear that she is being mixed\nup in something much more wicked and dangerous than the restitution of a\npersecuted man to his \u201crights.\u201d After all she can by this time have few illusions\nas to Walter\u2019s personal character.",
    "She works herself up to going to the Vicar\nagain and telling him what she knows of the story under the seal of confession.",
    "The Vicar is stern with her.",
    "It is absurd to suppose that he can give her\nabsolution.",
    "She is not repentant\u2014she is merely frightened.",

    "He hears that\nElma and the Admiral are out to dinner and will probably not be back till pretty\nlate.",
    "This is tiresome but he must do what he can.",
    "He will stay the night and\nmake one more effort to see the Admiral but if not he will simply go up to town\nnext morning and carry out his plan.",
    "He dines at the Lord Marshall and then goes\nout for a walk while doing so he is seen by Denny.",

    "The rendezvous\nis fixed for 11.15 sharp.",
    "The Admiral swallows the bait eagerly.",
    "Walter through\nDenny has told Elma about all this though to her of course \u201cthe man\u201d is the\nmysterious person who has got \u201cthe hold\u201d over the Admiral and is going to\nsqueeze the consent to the marriage out of him.",
    "The Admiral equally of course\nthinks Elma is quite in the dark about it all.",
    "3.",
    "The plan for the murder is this Denny is to go on foot to the old boathouse meet the Admiral at 11.15 and hold him in talk.",
    "Meantime Walter goes to\nthe Lord Marshall arriving about 11.15.",
    "There with his beard and family\nresemblance to his uncle the Admiral he will easily be mistaken for him in the\ndim light.",
    "He is to leave some sort of message.",
    "When Walter hears from Denny\nthat Holland is in Whynmouth they seize on this circumstance.",
    "Walter is to ask\nfor him suggesting that Holland may be involved in the business if anything\ngoes wrong with their plans.",
    "Thus they will establish the fact that the Admiral\nintended to travel by the 11.25 train.",
    "Walter will then take Denny\u2019s car to\nFernton Bridge about three minutes by car and while Denny holds up the\nAdmiral Walter will bash him savagely about the head with a blunt instrument.",
    "The body is then to be taken to the level crossing which is the kind worked by a\nlever from the signalbox.",
    "All this should not take more than about seven\nminutes say one minute for the bashing three minutes from boathouse to car\nthree minutes to level crossing\u2014this allows him to drive at only thirtyfive miles\nan hour over one and a quarter of a mile or thereabouts\u2014he could really go\nmuch faster for that brief distance.",
    "At about 11.22 they will carry the body on to\nthe down line through the side wickets trusting to the darkness.",
    "At 11.24 the\ndown express is due to pass through not stopping at Whynmouth.",
    "With any luck\nit will smash up the Admiral and the conclusion will be drawn that he met his\ndeath by accident through passing the level crossing through the wickets as a\nshort cut from the Lord Marshall to the UP platform see Map.",
    "Walter will then go on to Rundel Croft to see Elma who is expecting him.",
    "He\nwill explain that the meeting has taken place and that in consequence of what\nhas transpired the Admiral has gone up to town but that before going he has\ngiven consent to the marriage.",

    "Suddenly she hears the unmistakable noise of oars in\nthe rowlocks.",
    "She hurries down to the boathouse and in the summer dusk sees\nthe Admiral starting off down the river.",
    "He must be going to the fatal\nrendezvous In the summerhouse she has snatched up what she thinks is her\nblack calfskin bag but is really the Vicar\u2019s hat.",
    "She pulls the Vicar\u2019s boat in by\nthe rope at the stern but owing to the strong stream and the stiffness of the new\npainter has some difficulty in unhitching the painter from the mooringpost.",
    "She\ntherefore cuts the painter with Peter\u2019s knife and I think that at this point she\ndrops the knife into the river to be subsequently found.",

    "The length of the rope ought to indicate that the Vicarage boat was twice\nmoored that night and loosed each time by a cutting of the painter from a\nposition of disadvantage hence the missing two feet of rope which should be\nhanging up somewhere unless deliberately removed since the murder.",

    "It would be found that he\n\n\fhad not taken the train and that Holland had gone out at night it would be\nassumed that the murder had taken place and the body set adrift at or near\nWhynmouth.",

    "The plotters assumed that Holland\u2019s story would be disbelieved and that he\n\n\fwould be thought to have murdered Penistone at or near Whynmouth round\nabout eleven o\u2019clock.",

    "She thinks it may be too late if she goes for Mount so\nshe follows Penistone herself.",
    "If desirable she can have seen or felt the knife\nin the summerhouse.",
    "She cannot untie the painter so runs back for the knife.",
    "She comes on Penistone\u2019s boat about half a mile down the river.",
    "If it was at\nthe bridge there would not be time for Walter to get back to personate\nPenistone.",

    "When Holland\ngoes Walter and Denny put the body into the Vicar\u2019s boat as the best thing they\ncan think of and send the boat adrift.",
    "They had intended to throw it into the\nriver but the Vicar\u2019s boat seems a better idea.",
    "This putting the boats into the\nboathouse accounts for the boat\u2019s tidal movements as also the clothing on the\nbody being dry.",
    "ON THE\n\n\fDenny then walks home letting himself in unseen.",
    "Walter takes Celia to\nLondon but because he is afraid of her giving the show away he takes her on to\nParis till the storm blows over.",

    "He has a perfectly good excuse\nhe has called to see the Vicar in pursuit of his reporter\u2019s duties and like\neveryone else has found the house empty.",
    "The Inspector however knows that\nC\u00e9lie has been in the garden within ten minutes of his own arrival\u2014the wet\ngreengage stones and the handkerchief\u2014and that therefore she must have\nencountered Walter who would have just had time to murder her and leave\nwithout running into Rudge.",
    "If more time is needed the handkerchief and greengage stones can be found\nlying in the shade and would thus take longer to dry.",
    "The other importance of the\ngreengage clue is Rudge\u2019s deduction from it before Walter\u2019s recognition by a\nvillager happens that a woman who strolls cheerfully into a garden and eats\ngreengages is not likely to commit suicide three minutes later.",
    "The funeral card\nis a false clue it is really written by one of the servants or by the Vicar himself\nand is a genuine message to any possible caller.",

    "APPENDIX II\nNOTES ON MOORING OF BOAT\nExtract from letter from John Rhode\nI TOO\n\nwanted it to be necessary to get into the boat in order to cast it off or make\nit fast again.",
    "Now as it happens in a river with a considerable rise and fall of\ntide as this river must have had to account for the swiftness of the ebb and flow\nof the tidal stream this is nearly always necessary if it is desired to keep the\nboat afloat at all states of the tide.",
    "One method of mooring a boat under these\ncircumstances is as I visualised it.",
    "The mooringpost is driven into the bed of the stream beyond lowwater\nmark in water deep enough to float the boat at all times.",
    "A hard made of a few\nloads of stone is run from the bank to lowwater mark to save ploughing\nthrough the mud.",
    "A ringbolt is fixed at the shore end of this hard.",
    "Now having been out in the boat you want to come ashore.",
    "Right.",
    "Make fast\nthe painter to the mooringpost.",
    "Pole the boat round till her stern touches the\nhard.",
    "Jump ashore taking with you the end of a light line made fast at the other\nend to the ring in the stern of the boat.",
    "Then push the boat off again and make\nfast your end of the line to the ringbolt on shore adjusting the length of the line\nso that the boat lies parallel during the ebb with the bank.",
    "Having had your drink you want to put off again.",
    "Cast off the line and haul\nthe stern of the boat in till it touches the hard.",
    "Jump in with the line up in the\nstern.",
    "Go forward haul in on painter till you are near enough to the post then\ncast off.",
    "I gather that you want someone to get into the boat and cast off the painter.",
    "As\nyou will see unless the boat is approached by water this is necessary in any\ncase.",
    "In describing the incident remember how the boat swings.",
    "During the ebb\nthe boat lies as described.",
    "But during the flood the stern will swing in of itself\nand will remain touching the shore throughout the flood.",
    "This of course does\nnot matter since the water is rising.",
    "Remember too that any particular point in the tidal phase occurs near\nenough for this purpose about threequarters of an hour later on successive\ndays.",
    "Don\u2019t make it highwater at 10 a.m. one day and lowwater at 11 a.m. the\nnext.",
    "Also in a river like this the tide ebbs longer than it flows.",
    "I laid down\nrules for this particular river though I don\u2019t remember them exactly now for the\n\n\fguidance of those who followed.",
    "As for the distance of the pole from highwater mark you can within limits\nmake this to suit yourself.",
    "If you allow twelve feet or more measuring\nhorizontally between H.W.O.S.T.",
    "and L.W.O.S.T.",
    "and six feet or more between\nL.W.O.S.T.",
    "and the post you won\u2019t be far wrong.",
    "These distances can be\nincreased almost indefinitely but I shouldn\u2019t decrease them much or you will\nmake your bank awkwardly steep.",
    "COUNSEL\u2019S OPINION ON FITZGERALD\u2019S WILL\nlooked up your point in the library this afternoon and the result of my\nresearches for what they are worth is that it certainly has been held again and\nagain where a certain person\u2019s consent to marriage was required and that person\nhad died by act of God or at least by no fault of the beneficiary the condition\nrequiring a particular consent is void.",
    "None of the cases run the thing so fine that there is only twentyfour hours\nbetween the death of the person whose consent is required and the wedding of\nthe beneficiary who wants an absolute title to the property and I think it would\nbe necessary where the death is within twentyfour hours of the ceremony for\nthe beneficiary in order to get her absolute right if there were any contest to\nshow\nHAVE\n\nEither 1 That she intended to ask the necessary consent before the\nmarriage ceremony\n2 That she was prevented by the death and would have had time to\nask consent but for the death\nand 3 If suggested that the death was any fault of hers to defend\nherself against the allegation\nor else That the ceremony was not arranged until after death had made\nit impossible to obtain the necessary consent.",
    "Provided this last is true\nit matters not how soon after the death the beneficiary claims to treat\nthe condition as void.",
    "As to the last possibility I am no authority on marriage licences but from the\nbooks it appears that provided one party has resided fifteen days in the locality in\nwhich it is intended the marriage should take place notice may be given to the\nregistrar by that party and a marriage licence obtained from the registrar after the\nlapse of one full weekday\u2014in law language in fortytwo to fortyeight hours\nprovided Sunday does not intervene.",
    "This procedure is applicable to marriages in any other place than the\nestablished church i.e.",
    "registrar\u2019s office or Nonconformist place of worship\nlicensed for marriages.",
    "Without the fifteen days of previous residence the business takes longer.",
    "Once obtained a marriage licence is available for quite a long time three\nmonths I think but you might verify this.",
    "It is possible that one of your parties\nhad got a licence and was waiting for a favourable opportunity for the\nbeneficiary to ask the necessary consent.",
    "This sort of licence is only granted for\nmarriage in a particular place.",

    "In the case of conditions subsequent if the condition is impossible through\nthe act of God the gift remains tho\u2019 there may be a gift over on nonperformance of the condition.",
