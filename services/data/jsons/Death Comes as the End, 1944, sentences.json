    "Agatha Christie\nDEATH COMES AS THE END 1944\n\nTo Professor S.R.K.",
    "Glanville\nDear Stephen\nIt was you who originally suggested to me the idea of a detective story set in Ancient Egypt\nand but for your active help and encouragement this book would never have been written.",
    "I want to say here how much I have enjoyed all the interesting literature you have lent me\nand to thank you once more for the patience with which you have answered my questions\nand for the time and trouble you have expended.",
    "The pleasure and interest which the\nwriting of the book have brought to me you already know.",
    "Your affectionate and grateful friend\nAgatha Christie.",
    "Authors Note\nThe action of this book takes place on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes in Egypt about\n2000 B.C.",
    "Both places and time are incidental to the story.",
    "Any other place at any other\ntime would have served as well but it so happened that the inspiration of both characters\nand plot was derived from two or three Egyptian letters of the XIth Dynasty found about\ntwenty years ago by the Egyptian Expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art New\nYork in a rock tomb opposite Luxor and translated by Professor then Mr Battiscombe\nGunn in the Museums Bulletin.",
    "It may be of interest to the reader to note that an endowment for kaservice  an everyday\nfeature of ancient Egyptian civilization  was very similar in principle to a medieval\nchantry bequest.",
    "Property was bequeathed to the kapriest in return for which he was\nexpected to maintain the tomb of the testator and to provide offerings at the tomb on\ncertain feast days throughout the year for the repose of the deceaseds soul.",
    "The terms Brother Sister in Egyptian text regularly meaning Lover are frequently\ninterchangeable with Husband Wife.",
    "They are so used on occasion in this book.",
    "The agricultural calendar of Ancient Egypt consisting of three seasons of four months of\nthirty days formed the background of peasant life and with the addition of five intercalary\ndays at the end of the year was used as the official calendar of 365 days to the year.",
    "This\nyear originally began with the arrival in Egypt of the floodwater of the Nile in the third\nweek of July by our reckoning.",
    "The absence of a leap year caused this to lag through the\ncenturies so that at the time of our story the official New Years Day fell about six months\nearlier than the opening of the agricultural year i.e.",
    "in January instead of July.",
    "To save\nthe reader from continually having to make allowance for this six months however the\n\n\fdates here used as chapter headings are calculated by the agricultural year of the time i.e.",
    "Inundation  late July to late November Winter  late November to late March and\nSummer  late Match to late July.",
    "Chapter 1\nSECOND MONTH OF INUNDATION 20TH DAY\nRenisenb stood looking out over the Nile.",
    "In the distance she could hear faintly the upraised voices of her brothers Yahmose and\nSobek disputing as to whether or not the dikes in a certain place needed strengthening.",
    "Sobeks voice was high and confident as always.",
    "He had the habit of asserting his views\nwith easy certainty.",
    "Yahmoses voice was low and grumbling in tone it expressed doubt\nand anxiety.",
    "Yahmose was always in a state of anxiety over something or other.",
    "He was the\neldest son and during his fathers absence on the northern estates the management of the\nfarm lands was more or less in his hands.",
    "Yahmose was slow prudent and prone to look for\ndifficulties where none existed.",
    "He was a heavily built slowmoving man with none of\nSobeks gaiety and confidence.",
    "From her early childhood Renisenb could remember hearing these elder brothers of hers\narguing in just those selfsame accents.",
    "It gave her suddenly a feeling of security... She was\nat home again.",
    "Yes she had come home...",
    "Yet as she looked once more across the pale shining river her rebellion and pain mounted\nagain.",
    "Khay her young husband was dead... Khay with his laughing face and his strong\nshoulders.",
    "Khay was with Osiris in the Kingdom of the Dead  and she Renisenb his\ndearly loved wife was left desolate.",
    "Eight years they had had together  she had come to\nhim as little more than a child  and now she had returned widowed with Khays child\nTeti to her fathers house.",
    "It seemed to her at this moment as though she had never been away...\nShe welcomed that thought...\nShe would forget those eight years  so full of unthinking happiness so torn and destroyed\nby loss and pain.",
    "Yes forget them put them out of her mind.",
    "Become once more Renisenb Imhotep the\nkapriests daughter the unthinking unfeeling girl.",
    "This love of a husband and brother\nhad been a cruel thing deceiving her by its sweetness.",
    "She remembered the strong bronze\nshoulders the laughing mouth  now Khay was embalmed swathed in bandages protected\nwith amulets in his journey through the other world.",
    "No more Khay in this world to sail on\nthe Nile and catch fish and laugh up into the sun whilst she stretched out in the boat with\nlittle Teti on her lap laughed back at him...\nRenisenb thought\nI will not think of it.",
    "It is over Here I am at home.",
    "Everything is the same as it was.",
    "I too\nshall be the same presently.",
    "It will all be as before.",
    "Teti has forgotten already.",
    "She plays\nwith the other children and laughs.",
    "Renisenb turned abruptly and made her way back towards the house passing on the way\n\n\fsome loaded donkeys being driven towards the riverbank.",
    "She passed by the cornbins and\nthe outhouses and through the gateway into the courtyard.",
    "It was very pleasant in the\ncourtyard.",
    "There was the artificial lake surrounded by flowering oleanders and jasmines\nand shaded by sycamore fig trees.",
    "Teti and the other children were playing there now their\nvoices rising shrill and clear.",
    "They were running in and out of the little pavilion that stood\nat one side of the lake.",
    "Renisenb noticed that Teti was playing with a wooden lion whose\nmouth opened and shut by pulling a string a toy which she herself had loved as a child.",
    "She\nthought again gratefully I have come home...",
    "Nothing was changed here all was as it\nhad been.",
    "Here life was safe constant unchanging.",
    "Teti was now the child and she one of\nthe many mothers enclosed by the home walls  but the framework the essence of things\nwas unchanged.",
    "A ball with which one of the children was playing rolled to her feet and she picked it up\nand threw it back laughing.",
    "Renisenb went on to the porch with its gaily colored columns and then through into the\nhouse passing through the big central chamber with its colored frieze of lotus and poppies\nand so on to the back of the house and the womens quarters.",
    "Upraised voices struck on her ear and she paused again savoring with pleasure the old\nfamiliar echoes.",
    "Satipy and Kait  arguing as always Those wellremembered tones of\nSatipys voice high domineering and bullying Satipy was her brother Yahmoses wife a\ntall energetic loudtongued woman handsome in a hard commanding kind of way.",
    "She\nwas eternally laying down the law hectoring the servants finding fault with everything\ngetting impossible things done by sheer force of vituperation and personality.",
    "Everyone\ndreaded her tongue and ran to obey her orders.",
    "Yahmose himself had the greatest\nadmiration for his resolute spirited wife though he allowed himself to be bullied by her in\na way that had often infuriated Renisenb.",
    "At intervals in the pauses in Satipys highpitched sentences the quiet obstinate voice of\nKait was heard.",
    "Kait was a broad plainfaced woman the wife of the handsome gay\nSobek.",
    "She was devoted to her children and seldom thought or spoke about anything else.",
    "She sustained her side of the daily arguments with her sisterinlaw by the simple expedient\nof repeating whatever statement she had originally made with quiet immovable obstinacy.",
    "She displayed neither heat nor passion and never considered for a moment any side of a\nquestion but her own.",
    "Sobek was extremely attached to his wife and talked freely to her of\nall his affairs secure in the knowledge that she would appear to listen make comforting\nsounds of assent or dissent and would remember nothing inconvenient since her mind was\nsure to have been dwelling un some problem connected with the children all the time.",
    "Its an outrage thats what I say shouted Satipy.",
    "If Yahmose had the spirit of a mouse\nhe would not stand it for a moment Who is in charge here when Imhotep is absent\nYahmose And as Yahmoses wife it is I who should have the first choice of the woven mats\nand cushions.",
    "That hippopotamus of a black slave should be \nKaits heavy deep voice cut in\nNo no my little one do not eat your dolls hair.",
    "See here is something better  a sweet oh how good...\nAs for you Kait you have no courtesy you dont even listen to what I say  you do not\nreply  your manners are atrocious.",
    "The blue cushion has always been mine... Oh look at little Ankh  she is trying to walk...\nYou are as stupid as your children Kait and that is saying a good deal But you shall not\n\n\fget out of it like this.",
    "I will have my rights I tell you.",
    "Renisenb started as a quiet footfall sounded behind her.",
    "She turned with a start and with\nthe old familiar feeling of dislike at seeing the woman Henet standing behind her.",
    "Henets thin face was twisted into its usual halfcringing smile.",
    "Things havent changed much youll be thinking Renisenb she said.",
    "How we all bear\nSatipys tongue I dont know Of course Kait can answer back.",
    "Some of us arent so\nfortunate I know my place I hope  and my gratitude to your father for giving me a home\nand food and clothing.",
    "Ah hes a good man your father.",
    "And Ive always tried to do what I\ncan.",
    "Im always working  giving a hand here and a hand there  and I dont expect thanks\nor gratitude.",
    "If your dear mother had lived it would have been different.",
    "She appreciated\nme.",
    "Like sisters we were A beautiful woman she was.",
    "Well Ive done my duty and kept my\npromise to her.",
    "Look after the children Henet she said when she was dying.",
    "And Ive\nbeen faithful to my word.",
    "Slaved for you all I have and never wanted thanks.",
    "Neither\nasked for them nor got them Its only old Henet people say she doesnt count.",
    "Nobody\nthinks anything of me.",
    "Why should they I just try to be helpful thats all.",
    "She slipped like an eel under Renisenbs arm and entered the inner room.",
    "About those cushions youll excuse me Satipy but I happened to hear Sobek say \nRenisenb moved away.",
    "Her old dislike of Henet surged up.",
    "Funny how they all disliked\nHenet It was her whining voice her continual selfpity and the occasional malicious\npleasure she took in fanning the flames of a discussion.",
    "Oh well thought Renisenb why not It was she supposed Henets way of amusing\nherself.",
    "Life must be dreary for her  and it was true that she worked like a drudge and\nthat no one was ever grateful.",
    "You couldnt be grateful to Henet  she drew attention to her\nown merits so persistently that it chilled any generous response you might have felt.",
    "Henet thought Renisenb was one of those people whose fate it is to be devoted to others\nand to have no one devoted to them.",
    "She was unattractive to look at and stupid as well.",
    "Yet\nshe always knew what was going on.",
    "Her noiseless way of walking her sharp ears and\nquick peering eyes made it a certainty that nothing could long be a secret from her.",
    "Sometimes she hugged her knowledge to herself  at other times she would go round from\none person to another whispering and standing back delightedly to observe the results of\nher taletelling.",
    "At one time or another everyone in the household had begged Imhotep to get rid of Henet\nbut Imhotep would never hear of such a thing.",
    "He was perhaps the only person who was\nfond of her and she repaid his patronage with a fulsome devotion that the rest of the\nfamily found quite nauseating.",
    "Renisenb stood uncertainly for a moment listening to the accelerated clamor of her\nsistersinlaw fanned by the flame of Henets interference then she went slowly towards\nthe small room where her grandmother Esa sat by herself attended by two little black\nslave girls.",
    "She was busy now inspecting certain linen garments that they were displaying to\nher and scolding them in a characteristic friendly fashion.",
    "Yes it was all the same.",
    "Renisenb stood unnoticed listening.",
    "Old Esa had shrunk a little\nthat was all.",
    "But her voice was the same and the things that she was saying were the same\nword for word almost as Renisenb could remember them before she herself had left home\neight years ago...\nRenisenb slipped out again.",
    "Neither the old woman nor the two little black slave girls had\nnoticed her.",
    "For a moment or two Renisenb paused by the open kitchen door.",
    "A smell of\n\n\froasting ducks a lot of talking and laughing and scolding all going on at once a mound of\nvegetables waiting to be prepared.",
    "Renisenb stood quite still her eyes half closed.",
    "From where she stood she could hear\neverything going on at once.",
    "The rich varied noises of the kitchen the high shrill note of\nold Esas voice the strident tones of Satipy and very faintly the deeper persistent\ncontralto of Kait.",
    "A babel of womens voices  chattering laughing complaining scolding\nexclaiming...\nAnd suddenly Renisenb felt stifled encircled by this persistent and clamorous femininity.",
    "Women  noisy vociferous women A houseful of women  never quiet never peaceful always talking exclaiming saying things  not doing them\nAnd Khay  Khay silent and watchful in his boat his whole mind bent on the fish he was\ngoing to spear...\nNone of this clack of tongues this busy incessant fussiness.",
    "Renisenb went swiftly out of the house again into hot clear stillness.",
    "She saw Sobek coming\nback from the fields and saw in the distance Yahmose going up towards the Tomb.",
    "She turned away and took the path up to the limestone cliffs where the Tomb was.",
    "It was\nthe Tomb of the great noble Meriptah and her father was the mortuary priest responsible\nfor its upkeep.",
    "All the estate and land was part of the endowment of the Tomb.",
    "When her father was away the duties of the kapriest fell upon her brother Yahmose.",
    "When Renisenb walking slowly up the steep path arrived Yahmose was in consultation\nwith Hori her fathers man of business and affairs in a little rock chamber next door to\nthe offering chamber of the Tomb.",
    "Hori had a sheet of papyrus spread out on his knees and Yahmose and he were bending\nover it.",
    "Both Yahmose and Hori smiled at Renisenb when she arrived and she sat down near them\nin a patch of shade.",
    "She had always been very fond of her brother Yahmose.",
    "He was gentle\nand affectionate to her and had a mild and kindly disposition.",
    "Hori too had always been\ngravely kind to the small Renisenb and had sometimes mended her toys for her.",
    "He had\nbeen a grave silent young man when she went away with sensitive clever fingers.",
    "Renisenb thought that though he looked older he had changed hardly at all.",
    "The grave\nsmile he gave her was just the same as she remembered.",
    "Yahmose and Hori were murmuring together\nSeventythree bushels of barley with Ipi the younger...",
    "The total then is two hundred and thirty of spelt and one hundred and twenty of barley.",
    "Yes but there is the price of the timber and the crop was paid for in oil at Perhaa...\nTheir talk went on.",
    "Renisenb sat drowsily content with the mens murmuring voices as a\nbackground.",
    "Presently Yahmose got up and went away handing back the roll of papyrus\nto Hori.",
    "Renisenb sat on in a companionable silence.",
    "Presently she touched a roll of papyrus and asked Is that from my father\nHori nodded.",
    "What does it say she asked curiously.",
    "She unrolled it and stared at those marks that were so meaningless to her untutored eyes.",
    "Smiling a little Hori leaned over her shoulder and traced with his finger as he read.",
    "The\nletter was couched in the ornate style of the professional letter writer of Heracleopolis.",
    "The Servant of the Estate the kaservant Imhotep says May your condition be like that\n\n\fof one who lives a million times.",
    "May the God Herishaf Lord of Heracleopolis and all the\nGods that are aid you.",
    "May the God Ptah gladden your heart as one who lives long.",
    "The\nson speaks to his mother the kaservant to his mother Esa.",
    "How are you in your life safety\nand health To the whole household how are you To my son Yahmose how are you in\nyour life safety and health Make the most of my land.",
    "Strive to the uttermost dig the\nground with your noses in the work.",
    "See if you are industrious I will praise God for you \nRenisenb laughed.",
    "Poor Yahmose He works hard enough I am sure.",
    "Her fathers exhortations had brought him vividly before her eyes  his pompous slightly\nfussy manner his continual exhortations and instructions.",
    "Hori went on\nTake great care of my son Ipy.",
    "I hear he is discontented.",
    "Also see that Satipy treats Henet\nwell.",
    "Mind this.",
    "Do not fail to write about the flax and the oil.",
    "Guard the produce of my\ngrain  guard everything of mine for I shall hold you responsible.",
    "If my land floods woe to\nyou and Sobek.",
    "My father is just the same said Renisenb happily.",
    "Always thinking that nothing can be\ndone right if he is not here.",
    "She let the roll of papyrus slip and added softly\nEverything is just the same...\nHori did not answer.",
    "He took up a sheet of papyrus and began to write.",
    "Renisenb watched him lazily for some\ntime.",
    "She felt too contented to speak.",
    "By and by she said dreamily\nIt would be interesting to know how to write on papyrus.",
    "Why doesnt everyone learn\nIt is not necessary.",
    "Not necessary perhaps but it would be pleasant.",
    "You think so Renisenb What difference would it make to you\nRenisenb considered for a moment or two.",
    "Then she said slowly\nWhen you ask me like that truly I do not know Hori.",
    "Hori said At present a few scribes are all that are needed on a large estate but the day\nwill come I fancy when there will be armies of scribes all over Egypt.",
    "We are living at the\nbeginning of great times.",
    "That will be a good thing said Renisenb.",
    "Hori said slowly I am not so sure.",
    "Why are you not sure\nBecause Renisenb it is so easy and it costs so little labor to write down ten bushels of\nbarley or a hundred head of cattle or ten fields of spelt  and the thing that is written will\ncome to seem like the real thing and so the writer and the scribe will come to despise the\nman who ploughs the fields and reaps the barley and raises the cattle  but all the same the\nfields and the barley and the cattle are real  they are not just marks of ink on papyrus.",
    "And when all the records and all the papyrus rolls are destroyed and the scribes are\nscattered the men who toil and reap will go on and Egypt will still live.",
    "Renisenb looked at him attentively.",
    "She said slowly Yes I see what you mean.",
    "Only the\nthings that you can see and touch and hear are real... To write down I have two hundred\nand forty bushels of barley means nothing unless you have the barley.",
    "One could write\ndown lies.",
    "Hori smiled at her serious face.",
    "Renisenb said suddenly\nYou mended my lion for me  long ago do you remember\nYes I remember Renisenb.",
    "Teti is playing with it now...",
    "It is the same lion.",
    "She paused and then said simply\nWhen Khay went to Osiris I was very sad.",
    "But now I have come home and I shall be\nhappy again and forget  for everything here is the same.",
    "Nothing is changed at all.",
    "You really think that\nRenisenb looked up at him sharply.",
    "What do you mean Hori\nI mean there is always change.",
    "Eight years is eight years.",
    "Nothing changes here said Renisenb with confidence.",
    "Perhaps then there should be change.",
    "Renisenb said sharply\nNo no I want everything the same\nBut you yourself are not the same Renisenb who went away with Khay.",
    "Yes I am Or if not then I soon shall be again.",
    "Hori shook his head.",
    "You cannot go back Renisenb.",
    "It is like my measures here.",
    "I take a half and add to it a\nquarter and then a tenth and then a twentyfourth  and at the end you see it is a different\nquantity altogether.",
    "But I am just Renisenb.",
    "But Renisenb has something added to her all the time so she becomes all the time a\ndifferent Renisenb\nNo no.",
    "You are the same Hori.",
    "You may think so but it is not so.",
    "Yes yes and Yahmose is the same so worried and so anxious and Satipy bullies him just\nthe same and she and Kait were having their usual quarrel about mats or beads and\npresently when I go back they will be laughing together the best of friends and Henet still\ncreeps about and listens and whines about her devotion and my grandmother was fussing\nwith her little maid over some linen It was all the same and presently my father will come\nhome and there will be a great fuss and he will say Why have you not done this and\nYou should have done that and Yahmose will look worried and Sobek will laugh and be\ninsolent about it and my father will spoil Ipy who is sixteen just as he used to spoil him\nwhen he was eight and nothing will be different at all She paused breathless.",
    "Hori sighed.",
    "Then he said gently\nYou do not understand Renisenb.",
    "There is an evil that comes from outside that attacks\nso that all the world can see but there is another kind of rottenness that breeds from within\n that shows no outward sign.",
    "It grows slowly day by day till at last the whole fruit is\nrotten  eaten away by disease.",
    "Renisenb stared at him.",
    "He had spoken almost absently not as though he were speaking to\nher but more like a man who muses to himself.",
    "She cried out sharply\nWhat do you mean Hori You make me afraid.",
    "I am afraid myself.",
    "But what do you mean What is this evil you talk about\n\n\fHe looked at her then and suddenly smiled.",
    "Forget what I said Renisenb.",
    "I was thinking of the diseases that attack the crops.",
    "Renisenb sighed in relief.",
    "Im glad.",
    "I thought  I dont know what I thought.",
    "Chapter 2\nTHIRD MONTH OF INUNDATION 4TH DAY\nSatipy was talking to Yahmose.",
    "Her voice had a high strident note that seldom varied its\ntone.",
    "You must assert yourself.",
    "That is what I say You will never be valued unless you assert\nyourself.",
    "Your father says this must be done and that must be done and why have you not\ndone this And you listen meekly and reply Yes yes and excuse yourself for the things that\nhe says should have been done  and which the Gods know have often been quite\nimpossible Your father treats you as a child  as a young irresponsible boy You might be\nthe age of Ipy.",
    "Yahmose said quietly\nMy father does not treat me in the least as he treats Ipy.",
    "No indeed.",
    "Satipy fell upon the new subject with renewed venom.",
    "He is foolish about\nthat spoiled brat Day by day Ipy gets more impossible.",
    "He swaggers round and does no\nwork that he can help and pretends that anything that is asked of him is too hard for him\nIt is a disgrace.",
    "And all because he knows that your father will always indulge him and take\nhis part.",
    "You and Sobek should take a strong line about it.",
    "Yahmose shrugged his shoulders.",
    "What is the good\nYou drive me mad Yahmose  that is so like you You have no spirit.",
    "Youre as meek as a\nwoman Everything that your father says you agree with at once\nI have a great affection for my father.",
    "Yes and he trades on that You go on meekly accepting blame and excusing yourself for\nthings that are no fault of yours You should speak up and answer him back as Sobek does.",
    "Sobek is afraid of nobody\nYes but remember Satipy that it is I who am trusted by my father not Sobek.",
    "My father\nreposes no confidence in Sobek.",
    "Everything is always left to my judgment not his.",
    "And that is why you should be definitely associated as a partner in the estate You\nrepresent your father when he is away you act as kapriest in his absence everything is left\nin your hands  and yet you have no recognized authority.",
    "There should be a proper\nsettlement.",
    "You are now a man of nearly middle age.",
    "It is not right that you should be\ntreated still as a child.",
    "Yahmose said doubtfully\nMy father likes to keep things in his own hands.",
    "Exactly.",
    "It pleases him that everyone in the household should be dependent upon him and upon his whim of the moment.",
    "It is bad that and it will get worse.",
    "This time when he\ncomes home you must tackle him boldly  you must say that you demand a settlement in\nwriting that you insist on having a regularized position.",
    "He would not listen.",
    "Then you must make him listen.",
    "Oh that I were a man If I were in your place I would\nknow what to do Sometimes I feel that I am married to a woman.",
    "Yahmose flushed.",
    "I will see what I can do  I might yes I might perhaps speak to my father  ask him \nNot ask  you must demand After all you have the whip hand of him.",
    "There is no one but\nyou whom he can leave in charge here.",
    "Sobek is too wild your father does not trust him\nand Ipy is too young.",
    "There is always Hori.",
    "Hori is not a member of the family.",
    "Your father relies on his judgment but he would not\nleave authority except in the hands of his own kin.",
    "But I see how it is you are too meek and\nmild  there is milk in your veins not blood You dont consider me or our children.",
    "Not till\nyour father is dead shall we ever have our proper position.",
    "Yahmose said heavily\nYou despise me dont you Satipy\nYou make me angry.",
    "Listen I tell you that I will speak to my father when he comes.",
    "There it is a promise.",
    "Satipy murmured under her breath\nYes  but how will you speak Like a man  or like a mouse\nII\nKait was playing with her youngest child little Ankh.",
    "The baby was just beginning to walk\nand Kait encouraged her with laughing words kneeling in front of her and waiting with\noutstretched arms until the child lurched precariously forward and toddled on uncertain\nfeet into her mothers arms.",
    "Kait had been displaying these accomplishments to Sobek but she realized suddenly that\nhe was not attending but was sitting with his handsome forehead furrowed into a frown.",
    "Oh Sobek  you were not looking.",
    "You do not see little one tell your father he is naughty\nnot to watch you.",
    "Sobek said irritably\nI have other things to think of  yes and worry about.",
    "Kait leaned back on her heels smoothing her hair back from her heavy dark brows where\nAnkhs fingers had clutched it.",
    "Why Is there something wrong\nKait spoke without quite giving all her attention.",
    "The question was more than half\nmechanical.",
    "Sobek said angrily\nThe trouble is that I am not trusted.",
    "My father is an old man absurdly oldfashioned in\nhis ideas and he insists on dictating every single action here  he will not leave things to my\njudgment.",
    "Kait shook her head and murmured vaguely\nYes yes it is too bad.",
    "If only Yahmose had a little more spirit and would back me up there might be some hope\nof making my father see reason.",
    "But Yahmose is so timid.",
    "He carries out every single\ninstruction my father gives him to the letter.",
    "Kait jingled some beads at the child and murmured\nYes that is true.",
    "In this matter of the timber I shall tell my father when he comes that I used my judgment.",
    "It was far better to take the price in flax and not in oil.",
    "I am sure you are right.",
    "But my father is as obstinate over having his own way as anyone can be.",
    "He will make an\noutcry will shout out I told you to transact the business in oil.",
    "Everything is done wrong\nwhen I am not here.",
    "You are a foolish boy who knows nothing How old does he think I\nam He doesnt realize that I am now a man in my prime and he is past his.",
    "His\ninstructions and his refusals to sanction any unusual transactions mean that we do not do\nnearly as good business as we might do.",
    "To attain riches it is necessary to take a few risks.",
    "I\nhave vision and courage.",
    "My father has neither.",
    "Her eyes on the child Kait murmured softly\nYou are so bold and so clever Sobek.",
    "But he shall hear some home truths this time if he dares to find fault and shout abuse at\nme Unless I am given a free hand I shall leave.",
    "I shall go away.",
    "Kait her hand stretched out to the child turned her head sharply the gesture arrested.",
    "Go away Where would you go\nSomewhere It is insupportable to be bullied and nagged at by a fussy selfimportant old\nman who gives me no scope at all to show what I can do.",
    "No said Kait sharply.",
    "I say no Sobek.",
    "He stared at her recalled by her tone into noticing her presence.",
    "He was so used to her as a\nmerely soothing accompaniment to his talk that he often forgot her existence as a living\nthinking human woman.",
    "What do you mean Kait\nI mean that I will not let you be foolish.",
    "All the estate belongs to your father  the lands\nthe cultivation the cattle the timber the fields of flax  all When your father dies it will be\nours  yours and Yahmoses and our childrens.",
    "If you quarrel with your father and go off\nthen he may divide your share between Yahmose and Ipy  already he loves Ipy too much.",
    "Ipy knows that and trades on it.",
    "You must not play into the hands of Ipy.",
    "It would suit him\nonly too well if you were to quarrel with Imhotep and go away.",
    "We have our children to\nthink of.",
    "Sobek stared at her.",
    "Then he gave a short surprised laugh.",
    "A woman is always unexpected.",
    "I did not know you had it in you Kait to be so fierce.",
    "Kait said earnestly\nDo not quarrel with your father.",
    "Do not answer him back.",
    "Be wise for a little longer.",
    "Perhaps you are right  but this may go on for years.",
    "What my father should do is to\nassociate us with him in a partnership.",
    "Kait shook her head.",
    "He will not do that.",
    "He likes too much to say that we are all eating his bread that we are\nall dependent on him that without him we should all be nowhere.",
    "Sobek looked at her curiously.",
    "You do not like my father very much Kait.",
    "But Kait had bent once more to the toddling baby.",
    "Come sweetheart  see here is your doll.",
    "Come then  come...\nSobek looked down at her black bent head.",
    "Then with a puzzled look he went out.",
    "III\n\n\fEsa had sent for her grandson Ipy.",
    "The boy a handsome discontentedlooking stripling was standing before her whilst she\nrated him in a high shrill voice peering at him out of her dim eyes that were shrewd\nalthough they could now see little.",
    "What is this I hear You will not do this and you will not do that You want to look after\nthe bulls and you do not like going with Yahmose or seeing to the cultivating What are\nthings coming to when a child like you says what he will or will not do\nIpy said sullenly\nI am not a child.",
    "I am grown now  and why should I be treated as a child Put to this\nwork or that with no say of my own and no separate allowance Given orders all the time\nby Yahmose Who does Yahmose think he is\nHe is your older brother and he is in charge here when my son Imhotep is away.",
    "Yahmose is stupid  slow and stupid.",
    "I am much cleverer than he is.",
    "And Sobek is stupid\ntoo for all that he boasts and talks about how clever he is Already my father has written\nand has said that I am to do the work that I myself choose \nWhich is none at all interpolated old Esa.",
    "And that I am to be given more food and drink and that if he hears I am discontented and\nhave not been well treated he will be very angry.",
    "He smiled as he spoke a sly upcurving smile.",
    "You are a spoiled brat said Esa with energy.",
    "And I shall tell Imhotep so.",
    "No no Grandmother you would not do that.",
    "His smile changed it became caressing if slightly impudent.",
    "You and I Grandmother we have the brains of the family.",
    "The impudence of you\nMy father relies on your judgment  he knows you are wise.",
    "That may be  indeed it is so  but I do not need you to tell me so.",
    "Ipy laughed.",
    "You had better be on my side Grandmother.",
    "What is this talk of sides\nThe big brothers are very discontented.",
    "Dont you know that Of course you do.",
    "Henet\ntells you everything.",
    "Satipy harangues Yahmose all day and all night whenever she can get\nhold of him.",
    "And Sobek has made a fool of himself over the sale of the timber and is afraid\nmy father will be furious when he finds out.",
    "You will see Grandmother in another year or\ntwo I shall be associated with my father and he will do everything that I wish.",
    "You the youngest of the family\nWhat does age matter My father is the one who has the power  and I am the one who\nknows how to manage my father\nThis is evil talk said Esa.",
    "Ipy said softly\nYou are not a fool Grandmother... You know quite well that my father in spite of all his\nbig talk is really a weak man \nHe stopped abruptly noting that Esa had shifted her head and was peering over his\nshoulder.",
    "He turned his own head to find Henet standing close behind him.",
    "So Imhotep is a weak man said Henet in her soft whining voice.",
    "He will not be pleased\nI think to hear that you have said that of him.",
    "Ipy gave a quick uneasy laugh.",
    "But you will not tell him Henet... Come now Henet  promise me... Dear Henet...\nHenet glided towards Esa.",
    "She raised her voice with its slightly whining note.",
    "Of course I never want to make trouble  you know that...",
    "I am devoted to all of you.",
    "I\nnever repeat anything unless I think it is my duty...",
    "I was teasing Grandmother that was all said Ipy.",
    "I shall tell my father so.",
    "He will\nknow I could not have said such a thing seriously.",
    "He gave Henet a short sharp nod and went out of the room.",
    "Henet looked after him and said to Esa\nA fine boy  a fine wellgrown boy.",
    "And how bravely he speaks\nEsa said sharply\nHe speaks dangerously.",
    "I do not like the ideas he has in his head.",
    "My son indulges him too\nmuch.",
    "Who would not He is such a handsome attractive boy.",
    "Handsome is as handsome does said Esa sharply.",
    "She was silent a moment or two then she said slowly\nHenet  I am worried.",
    "Worried Esa What should worry you Anyway the master will soon be here and then all\nwill be well.",
    "Will it I wonder.",
    "She was silent once more then she said\nIs my grandson Yahmose in the house\nI saw him coming towards the porch a few moments ago.",
    "Go and tell him I wish to speak with him.",
    "Henet departed.",
    "She found Yahmose on the cool porch with its gaily colored columns and\ngave him Esas message.",
    "Yahmose obeyed the summons at once.",
    "Esa said abruptly\nYahmose very soon Imhotep will be here.",
    "Yahmoses gentle face lighted up.",
    "Yes that will indeed be good.",
    "All is in order for him Affairs have prospered\nMy fathers instructions have been carried out as well as I could compass them.",
    "What of Ipy\nYahmose sighed.",
    "My father is overindulgent where that boy is concerned.",
    "It is not good for the lad.",
    "You must make that clear to Imhotep.",
    "Yahmose looked doubtful.",
    "Esa said firmly\nI will back you up.",
    "Sometimes said Yahmose sighing there seem to be nothing but difficulties.",
    "But\neverything will be right when my father comes.",
    "He can make his own decisions then.",
    "It is\nhard to act as he would wish in his absence  especially when I have no real authority and\nonly act as his delegate.",
    "Esa said slowly\nYou are a good son  loyal and affectionate.",
    "You have been a good husband too you have\nobeyed the proverb that says that a man should love his wife and make a home for her that\n\n\fhe should fill her belly and put clothes on her back and provide expensive ointments for\nher toilet and that he should gladden her heart as long as she lives.",
    "But there is a further\nprecept  it goes like this prevent her from getting the mastery.",
    "If I were you Grandson I\nshould take that precept to heart...\nYahmose looked at her flushed deeply and turned away.",
    "Chapter 3\nTHIRD MONTH OF INUNDATION 14TH DAY\nEverywhere there were bustle and preparation.",
    "Hundreds of loaves had been baked in the\nkitchen now ducks were roasting there was a smell of leeks and garlic and various spices.",
    "Women were shouting and giving orders servingmen ran to and fro.",
    "Everywhere ran the murmur\nThe master  the master is coming...\nRenisenb helping to weave garlands of poppies and lotus flowers felt an excited happiness\nbubbling up in her heart.",
    "Her father was coming home In the last few weeks she had\nslipped imperceptibly back into the confines of her old life.",
    "That first sense of unfamiliarity\nand strangeness induced in her she believed by Horis words had gone.",
    "She was the same\nRenisenb  Yahmose Satipy Sobek and Kait were all the same  now as in the past there\nwas all the bustle and fuss of preparations for Imhoteps return.",
    "Word had come ahead\nthat he would be with them before nightfall.",
    "One of the servants had been posted on the\nriverbank to give warning of the masters approach and suddenly his voice rang out loud\nand clear giving the agreed call.",
    "Renisenb dropped her flowers and ran out with the others.",
    "They all hastened towards the\nmooring place on the riverbank.",
    "Yahmose and Sobek were already there in a little crowd of\nvillagers fishermen and farm laborers all calling out excitedly and pointing.",
    "Yes there was the barge with its great square sail coming fast up the river with the north\nwind bellying out the sail.",
    "Close behind it was the kitchen barge crowded with men and\nwomen.",
    "Presently Renisenb could make out her father sitting holding a lotus flower and\nwith him someone whom she took to be a singer.",
    "The cries on the bank redoubled Imhotep waved a welcoming hand the sailors were\nheaving and pulling on the halyards.",
    "There were cries of Welcome to the master calls\nupon the Gods and thanks for his safe return and a few moments later Imhotep came\nashore greeting his family and answering the loud salutations that etiquette demanded.",
    "Praise be to Sobek the child of Neith who has brought you safely on the water Praise\nbe to Ptah south of the Memphite wall who brings you to us Thanks be to Re who\nillumines the Two Lands\nRenisenb pressed forward intoxicated with the general excitement.",
    "Imhotep drew himself up importantly and suddenly Renisenb thought\nBut he is a small man.",
    "I thought of him as much bigger than that.",
    "A feeling that was almost dismay passed over her.",
    "Had her father shrunk Or was her own memory at fault She had thought of him as\nrather a splendid being tyrannical often fussy exhorting everybody right and left and\nsometimes provoking her to quiet inward laughter but nevertheless a personage.",
    "But this\nsmall stout elderly man looking so full of his own importance and yet somehow failing to\nimpress  what was wrong with her What were these disloyal thoughts that came into her\n\n\fhead\nImhotep having finished the sonorous and ceremonial phrases had arrived at the stage of\nmore personal greetings.",
    "He embraced his sons.",
    "Ah my good Yahmose all smiles you have been diligent in my absence I am sure... And\nSobek my handsome son still given to merriness of heart I see.",
    "And here is Ipy  my\ndearest Ipy  let me look at you  stand away  so.",
    "Grown bigger more of a man How it\nrejoices my heart to hold you again And Renisenb  my dear daughter  once more in the\nhome.",
    "Satipy Kait my no less dear daughters... And Henet  my faithful Henet \nHenet was kneeling embracing his knees and ostentatiously wiping tears of joy from her\neyes.",
    "It is good to see you Henet  you are well  happy As devoted as ever  that is pleasant to\nthe heart...\nAnd my excellent Hori so clever with his accounts and his pen All has prospered I am\nsure it has.",
    "Then the greetings finished and the surrounding murmur dying down Imhotep raised his\nhand for silence and spoke out loud and clear\nMy sons and daughters  friends.",
    "I have a piece of news for you.",
    "For many years as you\nall know I have been a lonely man in one respect.",
    "My wife  your mother Yahmose and\nSobek  and my sister  your mother Ipy  have both gone to Osiris many years ago.",
    "So to\nyou Satipy and Kait I bring a new sister to share your home.",
    "Behold this is my concubine\nNofret whom you shall love for my sake.",
    "She has come with me from Memphis in the north\nand will dwell here with you when I go away again.",
    "As he spoke he drew forward a woman by the hand.",
    "She stood there beside him her head\nflung back her eyes narrowed young arrogant and beautiful.",
    "Renisenb thought with a shock of surprise But shes quite young  perhaps not as old as I\nam.",
    "Nofret stood quite still.",
    "There was a faint smile on her lips  it had more derision in it than\nany anxiety to please.",
    "She had very straight black brows and a rich bronze skin and her eyelashes were so long\nand thick that one could hardly see her eyes.",
    "The family taken aback stared in dumb silence.",
    "With a faint edge of irritation in his voice\nImhotep said\nCome now children welcome Nofret.",
    "Dont you know how to greet your fathers\nconcubine when he brings her to his house\nHaltingly and stumblingly the greetings were given.",
    "Imhotep affecting a heartiness that perhaps concealed some uneasiness exclaimed\ncheerfully\nThat is better Nofret Satipy and Kait and Renisenb will take you to the womens\nquarters.",
    "Where are the trunks Have the trunks been brought ashore \nThe roundtopped traveling trunks were being carried from the barge.",
    "Imhotep said to\nNofret\nYour jewels and your clothes are here safely.",
    "Go and see to their bestowing.",
    "Then as the women moved away together he turned to his sons.",
    "And what of the estate Does all go well\nThe lower fields that were rented to Nehkte  began Yahmose but his father cut him\nshort.",
    "No details now good Yahmose.",
    "They can wait.",
    "Tonight is rejoicing.",
    "Tomorrow you and I\nand Hori here will get to business.",
    "Come here Ipy my boy let us walk to the house.",
    "How\ntall you have grown  your head is above mine.",
    "Scowling Sobek walked behind his father and Ipy.",
    "Into Yahmoses ear he murmured\nJewels and clothes  did you hear That is where the profits of the northern estates have\ngone.",
    "Our profits.",
    "Hush whispered Yahmose.",
    "Our father will hear.",
    "What if he does I am not afraid of him as you are.",
    "Once in the house Henet came to Imhoteps room to prepare the bath.",
    "She was all smiles.",
    "Imhotep abandoned a little of his defensive heartiness.",
    "Well Henet and what do you think of my choice\nAlthough he had determined to carry things off with a high hand he had known quite well\nthat the arrival of Nofret would provoke a storm  at least in the womens part of the house.",
    "Henet was different  a singularly devoted creature.",
    "She did not disappoint him.",
    "She is beautiful Quite beautiful What hair what limbs She is worthy of you Imhotep.",
    "What can I say more than that Your dear wife who is dead will be glad that you have\nchosen such a companion to gladden your days.",
    "You think so Henet\nI am sure of it Imhotep.",
    "After mourning her so many years it is time that you once more\nenjoyed life.",
    "You knew her well...",
    "I too felt it was time to live as a man should live.",
    "Er  ahem  my\nsons wives and my daughter  they will take this with resentment perhaps\nThey had better not said Henet.",
    "After all do they not all depend upon you in this\nhouse\nVery true very true said Imhotep.",
    "Your bounty feeds and clothes them  their welfare is entirely the result of your efforts.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Imhotep sighed.",
    "I am continually active on their behalf.",
    "I sometimes doubt\nif they realize all they owe to me.",
    "You must remind them of it said Henet nodding her head.",
    "I your humble devoted\nHenet never forget what I owe you  but children are sometimes thoughtless and selfish\nthinking perhaps that it is they who are important and not realizing that they only carry\nout the instructions that you give.",
    "That is indeed most true said Imhotep.",
    "I have always said you were an intelligent\ncreature Henet.",
    "Henet sighed.",
    "If others only thought so.",
    "What is this Has anyone been unkind to you\nNo no  that is they do not mean it  it is a matter of course to them that I should work\nunceasingly  which I am glad to do  but a word of affection and appreciation that is what\nmakes all the difference.",
    "That you will always have from me said Imhotep.",
    "And this is always your home\nremember.",
    "You are too kind master.",
    "She paused and added The slaves are ready in the bathroom\nwith the hot water  and when you have bathed and dressed your mother asks that you\nshould go to her.",
    "Ah my mother Yes  yes of course...\n\n\fImhotep looked suddenly slightly embarrassed.",
    "He covered his confusion by saying\nquickly\nNaturally  I had intended that  tell Esa I shall come.",
    "II\nEsa dressed in her best pleated linen gown peered across at her son with a kind of\nsardonic amusement.",
    "Welcome Imhotep.",
    "So you have returned to us  and not alone I hear.",
    "Imhotep drawing himself up replied rather shamefacedly\nOh so you have heard\nNaturally.",
    "The house is humming with the news.",
    "The girl is beautiful they say and quite\nyoung.",
    "She is nineteen and  er  not illlooking.",
    "Esa laughed  an old womans spiteful cackle.",
    "Ah well she said theres no fool like an old fool.",
    "My dear mother.",
    "I am really at a loss to understand what you mean.",
    "Esa replied composedly\nYou always were a fool Imhotep.",
    "Imhotep drew himself up and spluttered angrily.",
    "Though usually comfortably conscious of\nhis own importance his mother could always pierce the armor of his selfesteem.",
    "In her\npresence he felt himself dwindling.",
    "The faint sarcastic gleam of her nearly sightless eyes\nnever failed to disconcert him.",
    "His mother there was no denying had never had an\nexaggerated opinion of his capabilities.",
    "And although he knew well that his own estimate of\nhimself was the true one and his mothers a maternal idiosyncrasy of no importance  yet\nher attitude never failed to puncture his happy conceit of himself.",
    "Is it so unusual for a man to bring home a concubine\nNot at all unusual.",
    "Men are usually fools.",
    "I fail to see where the folly comes in.",
    "Do you imagine that the presence of this girl is going to make for harmony in the\nhousehold Satipy and Kait will be beside themselves and will inflame their husbands.",
    "What has it to do with them What right have they to object\nNone.",
    "Imhotep began to walk up and down angrily.",
    "Can I not do as I please in my own house Do I not support my sons and their wives Do\nthey not owe the very bread they eat to me Do I not tell them so without ceasing\nYou are too fond of saying so Imhotep.",
    "It is the truth.",
    "They all depend on me.",
    "All of them\nAnd are you sure that that is a good thing\nAre you saying that it is not a good thing for a man to support his family\nEsa sighed.",
    "They work for you remember.",
    "Do you want me to encourage them in idleness Naturally they work.",
    "They are grown men  at least Yahmose and Sobek are  more than grown.",
    "Sobek has no judgment.",
    "He does everything wrong.",
    "Also he is frequently impertinent\nwhich I will not tolerate.",
    "Yahmose is a good obedient boy \n\n\fA good deal more than a boy\nBut sometimes I have to tell him things two or three times before he takes them in.",
    "I have\nto think of every thing  be everywhere All the time I am away I am dictating to scribes writing full instructions so that my sons can carry them out...",
    "I hardly rest  I hardly sleep\nAnd now when I come home having earned a little peace there is to be fresh difficulty\nEven you my mother deny my right to have a concubine like other men.",
    "You are angry \nEsa interrupted him.",
    "I am not angry.",
    "I am amused.",
    "There will be good sport to watch in the household  but I\nsay all the same that when you go north again you had best take the girl with you.",
    "Her place is here in my household And woe to any who dare illtreat her.",
    "It is not a question of illtreatment.",
    "But remember it is easy to kindle a fire in dry stubble.",
    "It has been said of women that the place where they are is not good...\nEsa paused and said slowly\nNofret is beautiful.",
    "But remember this Men are made fools by the gleaming limbs of\nwomen and lo in a minute they are become discolored carnelians...",
    "Her voice deepened as she quoted\nA trifle a little the likeness of a dream and death comes as the end.",
    "Chapter 4\nTHIRD MONTH OF INUNDATION 15TH DAY\nImhotep listened to Sobeks explanations of the sale of the timber in ominous silence.",
    "His\nface had grown very red and a small pulse was beating in his temple.",
    "Sobeks air of easy nonchalance wore a little thin.",
    "He had intended to carry things off with\na high hand but in the face of his fathers gathering frowns he found himself stammering\nand hesitating.",
    "Imhotep finally cut him short impatiently\nYes yes yes  you thought that you knew more than I did  you departed from my\ninstructions  it is always the same  unless I am here to see to everything.",
    "He sighed.",
    "What would become of you boys without me I cannot imagine\nSobek went on doggedly\nThere was a chance of making a much bigger profit  I took the risk.",
    "One cannot always\nbe pettifogging and cautious\nThere is nothing cautious about you Sobek You are rash and much too bold and your\njudgment is always wrong.",
    "Do I ever have a chance to exercise my judgment Imhotep said dryly\nYou have done so this time  against my express orders \nOrders Have I always got to take orders I am a grown man.",
    "Losing control of his temper Imhotep shouted\nWho feeds you who clothes you Who thinks of the future Who has your welfare  the\nwelfare of all of you  constantly in mind When the River was low and we were threatened\nwith famine did I not arrange for food to be sent south to you You are lucky to have such\na father  who thinks of everything And what do I ask in return Only that you should\nwork hard do your best and obey the instructions I send you \nYes shouted Sobek.",
    "We are to work for you like slaves  so that you can buy gold and\njewels for your concubine\n\n\fImhotep advanced towards him bristling with rage.",
    "Insolent boy  to speak like that to your father.",
    "Be careful or I will say that this is no\nlonger your home  and you can go elsewhere\nAnd if you are not careful I will go I have ideas I tell you  good ideas  that would bring\nin wealth if I was not tied down by pettifogging caution and never allowed to act as I\nchoose.",
    "Have you finished\nImhoteps tone was ominous.",
    "Sobek a trifle deflated muttered angrily\nYes  yes  I have no more to say  now.",
    "Then go and see after the cattle.",
    "This is no time for idling.",
    "Sobek turned and strode angrily away.",
    "Nofret was standing not far away and as he passed\nher she looked sideways at him and laughed.",
    "At her laugh the blood came up in Sobeks\nface  he made an angry halfstep towards her.",
    "She stood quite still looking at him out of\ncontemptuous halfclosed eyes.",
    "Sobek muttered something and resumed his former direction.",
    "Nofret laughed again then\nwalked slowly on to where Imhotep was now turning his attention to Yahmose.",
    "What possessed you to let Sobek act in that foolish fashion he demanded irritably.",
    "You should have prevented it Dont you know by now that he has no judgment in buying\nand selling He thinks everything will turn out as he wants it to turn out.",
    "Yahmose said apologetically\nYou do not realize my difficulties Father.",
    "You told me to entrust Sobek with the sale of\nthe timber.",
    "It was necessary therefore that it should be left to him to use his judgment.",
    "Judgment Judgment He has no judgment He is to do what I instruct him to do  and it\nis for you to see that he does exactly that.",
    "Yahmose flushed.",
    "I What authority have I\nWhat authority The authority I give you.",
    "But I have no real status.",
    "If I were legally associated with you \nHe broke off as Nofret came up.",
    "She was yawning and twisting a scarlet poppy in her\nhands.",
    "Wont you come to the little pavilion by the lake Imhotep It is cool there and there is\nfruit waiting for you and Keda beer.",
    "Surely you have finished giving your orders by now.",
    "In a minute Nofret  in a minute.",
    "Nofret said in a soft deep voice\nCome now.",
    "I want you to come now...\nImhotep looked pleased and a little sheepish.",
    "Yahmose said quickly before his father could\nspeak\nLet us just speak of this first.",
    "It is important.",
    "I want to ask you \nNofret spoke directly to Imhotep turning her shoulder on Yahmose\nCan you not do what you want in your own house\nImhotep said sharply to Yahmose\nAnother time my son.",
    "Another time.",
    "He went with Nofret and Yahmose stood on the porch looking after them.",
    "Satipy came out from the house and joined him.",
    "Well she demanded eagerly have you spoken to him What did he say\nYahmose sighed.",
    "Do not be so impatient Satipy.",
    "The time was not  propitious.",
    "Satipy gave an angry exclamation.",
    "Oh yes  thats what you would say That is what you will always say.",
    "The truth is you are\nafraid of your father  you are as timid as a sheep  you bleat at him  you will not stand up\nto him like a man Do you not recall the things you promised me I tell you I am the better\nman of us two You promise  you say I will ask my father  at once  the very first day.",
    "And what happens \nSatipy paused  for breath not because she had finished  but Yahmose cut in mildly\nYou are wrong Satipy.",
    "I began to speak  but we were interrupted.",
    "Interrupted By whom\nBy Nofret.",
    "Nofret That woman Your father should not let his concubine interrupt when he is\nspeaking of business to his eldest son.",
    "Women should not concern themselves with\nbusiness.",
    "Possibly Yahmose wished that Satipy herself would live up to the maxim she was\nenunciating so glibly but he was given no opportunity to speak.",
    "His wife swept on\nYour father should have made that clear to her at once.",
    "My father said Yahmose dryly showed no signs of displeasure.",
    "It is disgraceful Satipy declared.",
    "Your father is completely bewitched by her.",
    "He lets\nher say and do as she pleases.",
    "Yahmose said thoughtfully\nShe is very beautiful...\nSatipy snorted.",
    "Oh she has looks of a kind.",
    "But no manners No upbringing She does not care how rude\nshe is to all of us.",
    "Perhaps you are rude to her\nI am the soul of politeness.",
    "Kait and I treat her with every courtesy.",
    "Oh she shall have\nnothing of which to go complaining to your father.",
    "We can wait our time Kait and I.\nYahmose looked up sharply.",
    "How do you mean  wait your time\nSatipy laughed meaningly as she moved away.",
    "My meaning is womans meaning  you would not understand.",
    "We have our ways  and\nour weapons Nofret would do well to moderate her insolence.",
    "What does a womans life\ncome to in the end after all It is spent in the back of the house  amongst the other\nwomen.",
    "There was a peculiar significance in Satipys tone.",
    "She added\nYour father will not always be here...",
    "He will go away again to his estates in the north.",
    "And then  we shall see.",
    "Satipy \nSatipy laughed  a hardsounding high laugh  and went back into the house.",
    "II\nBy the lake the children were running about and playing.",
    "Yahmoses two boys were fine\nhandsome little fellows looking more like Satipy than like their father.",
    "Then there were\nSobeks three  the youngest a mere toddling baby.",
    "And there was Teti a grave handsome\nchild of four years.",
    "They laughed and shouted threw balls  occasionally a dispute broke out and a childish\nwail of anger rose high and shrill.",
    "Sitting sipping his beer with Nofret beside him Imhotep murmured How fond children\nare of playing by water.",
    "It was always so I remember.",
    "But by Hathor what a noise they\nmake\nNofret said quickly\nYes  and it could be so peaceful... Why do you not tell them to go away whilst you are\nhere After all when the master of the house wants relaxation a proper respect should be\nshown.",
    "Dont you agree\nI  well  Imhotep hesitated.",
    "The idea was new to him but pleasing.",
    "I do not really mind\nthem he finished doubtfully.",
    "He added rather weakly\nThey are accustomed to play here always as they please.",
    "When you are away yes said Nofret quickly.",
    "But think Imhotep considering all that\nyou do for your family they should show more sense of your dignity  of your importance.",
    "You are too gentle  too easygoing.",
    "Imhotep sighed placidly.",
    "It has always been my failing.",
    "I never insist on the outward forms.",
    "And therefore these women your sons wives take advantage of your kindness.",
    "It should\nbe understood that when you come here for repose there must be silence and tranquility.",
    "See I will go and tell Kait to take her children away and the others too.",
    "Then you shall\nhave peace and contentment here.",
    "You are a thoughtful girl Nofret  yes a good girl.",
    "You are always thinking of my\ncomfort.",
    "Nofret murmured Your pleasure is mine.",
    "She got up and went to where Kait was kneeling by the water playing with a little model\nbarge which her second child a rather spoiltlooking boy was trying to float.",
    "Nofret said curtly\nWill you take the children away Kait\nKait stared up at her uncomprehendingly.",
    "Away What do you mean This is where they always play.",
    "Not today.",
    "Imhotep wants peace.",
    "These children of yours are noisy.",
    "Color flamed into Kaits heavy face.",
    "You should mend your ways of speech Nofret Imhotep likes to see his sons children\nplaying here.",
    "He has said so.",
    "Not today said Nofret.",
    "He has sent me to tell you to take the whole noisy brood into the\nhouse so that he can sit in peace  with me.",
    "With you... Kait stopped abruptly in what she had been about to say.",
    "Then she got up\nand walked to where Imhotep was halfsitting halflying.",
    "Nofret followed her.",
    "Kait spoke without circumlocution.",
    "Your concubine says I am to take the children away from here Why What are they\ndoing that is wrong For what reason should they be banished\nI should have thought the wish of the master of the house was enough said Nofret softly.",
    "Exactly  exactly said Imhotep pettishly.",
    "Why should I have to give reasons Whose\nhouse is this\nI suppose it is she who wants them away.",
    "Kait turned and looked Nofret up and down.",
    "Nofret thinks of my comfort  of my enjoyment said Imhotep.",
    "No one else in this house\never considers it  except perhaps poor Henet.",
    "So the children are not to play here any more\nNot when I have come here to rest.",
    "Kaits anger flamed forth suddenly\nWhy do you let this woman turn you against your own blood Why should she come and\ninterfere with the ways of the house  with what has always been done\nImhotep suddenly began to shout.",
    "He felt a need to vindicate himself.",
    "It is I who say what is to be done here  not you You are all in league to do as you choose to arrange everything to suit yourselves.",
    "And when I the master of the house come home\nno proper attention is paid to my wishes.",
    "But I am master here let me tell you I am\nconstantly planning and working for your welfare  but am I given gratitude are my\nwishes respected No.",
    "First Sobek is insolent and disrespectful and now you Kait try to\nbrowbeat me What am I supporting you all for Take care  or I shall cease to support\nyou.",
    "Sobek talks of going  then let him go and take you and your children with him.",
    "For a moment Kait stood perfectly still.",
    "There was no expression at all on her heavy rather\nvacant face.",
    "Then she said in a voice from which all emotion had been eliminated\nI will take the children into the house...\nShe moved a step or two pausing by Nofret.",
    "In a low voice Kait said\nThis is your doing Nofret.",
    "I shall not forget.",
    "No I shall not forget...\nChapter 5\nFOURTH MONTH OF INUNDATION 5TH DAY\nImhotep breathed a sigh of satisfaction as he finished his ceremonial duties as mortuary\npriest.",
    "The ritual had been observed with meticulous detail  for Imhotep was in every\nrespect a most conscientious man.",
    "He had poured the libations burnt incense and offered\nthe customary offerings of food and drink.",
    "Now in the cool shade of the adjacent rock chamber where Hori was waiting for him\nImhotep became once more the landowner and the man of affairs.",
    "Together the two men\ndiscussed business matters prevailing prices and the profits resulting from crops cattle\nand timber.",
    "After half an hour or so Imhotep nodded his head with satisfaction.",
    "You have an excellent head for business Hori he said.",
    "The other smiled.",
    "I should have Imhotep.",
    "I have been your man of affairs for many years now.",
    "And a most faithful one.",
    "Now I have a matter to discuss with you.",
    "It concerns Ipy.",
    "He\ncomplains that his position is subordinate.",
    "He is still very young.",
    "But he shows great ability.",
    "He feels that his brothers are not always fair to him.",
    "Sobek it\nseems is rough and overbearing  and Yahmoses continual caution and timidity irk him.",
    "Ipy is highspirited.",
    "He does not like taking orders.",
    "Moreover he says that it is only I his\nfather who have the right to command.",
    "That is true said Hori.",
    "And it has struck me Imhotep that that is a weakness here on\nthe estate.",
    "May I speak freely\nCertainly my good Hori.",
    "Your words are always thoughtful and wellconsidered.",
    "Then I say this.",
    "When you are away Imhotep there should be someone here who has real\n\n\fauthority.",
    "I trust my affairs to you and to Yahmose \nI know that we act for you in your absence  but that is not enough.",
    "Why not appoint one\nof your sons as a partner  associate him with you by a legal deed of settlement.",
    "Imhotep paced up and down frowning.",
    "Which of my sons do you suggest Sobek has an authoritative manner  but he is\ninsubordinate  I could not trust him.",
    "His disposition is not good.",
    "I was thinking of Yahmose.",
    "He is your eldest son.",
    "He has a gentle and affectionate\ndisposition.",
    "He is devoted to you.",
    "Yes he has a good disposition  but he is too timid  too yielding.",
    "He gives in to everybody.",
    "Now if Ipy were only a little older \nHori said quickly\nIt is dangerous to give power to too young a man.",
    "True  true  well.",
    "Hori I will think of what you have said.",
    "Yahmose is certainly a good\nson... an obedient son...\nHori said gently but urgently\nYou would I think be wise.",
    "Imhotep looked at him curiously.",
    "What is in your mind Hori\nHori said slowly\nI said just now that it is dangerous to give a man power when he is too young.",
    "But it is\nalso dangerous to give it to him too late.",
    "You mean that he has become too used to obeying orders and not to giving them Well\nperhaps there is something in that.",
    "Imhotep sighed.",
    "It is a difficult task to rule a family The women in particular are hard to manage.",
    "Satipy\nhas an ungovernable temper Kait is often sulky.",
    "But I have made it clear to them that\nNofret is to be treated in a proper fashion.",
    "I think I may say that \nHe broke off.",
    "A slave was coming panting up the narrow pathway.",
    "What is this\nMaster  a barge is here.",
    "A scribe called Kameni has come with a message from\nMemphis.",
    "Imhotep got up fussily.",
    "More trouble he exclaimed.",
    "As sure as Re sails the Heavens this will be more trouble\nUnless I am on hand to attend to things everything goes wrong.",
    "He went stamping down the path and Hori sat quite still looking after him.",
    "There was a troubled expression on his face.",
    "II\nRenisenb had been wandering aimlessly along the bank of the Nile when she heard shouts\nand commotion and saw people running towards the landing stage.",
    "She ran and joined them.",
    "In the boat that was pulling to shore stood a young man and just\nfor a moment as she saw him outlined against the bright light her heart missed a beat.",
    "A mad fantastic thought leapt into her mind.",
    "It is Khay she thought.",
    "Khay returned from the Underworld.",
    "Then she mocked herself for the superstitious fancy.",
    "Because in her own remembrance\nshe always thought of Khay as sailing on the Nile and this was indeed a young man of\nabout Khays build  she had imagined a fantasy.",
    "This man was younger than Khay with\nan easy supple grace and had a laughing gay face.",
    "He had come he told them from Imhoteps estates in the north.",
    "He was a scribe and his\nname was Kameni.",
    "A slave was despatched for her father and Kameni was taken to the house where food and\ndrink were put before him.",
    "Presently her father arrived and there was much consultation\nand talking.",
    "The gist of it all filtered through into the womens quarters with Henet as usual as the\npurveyor of the news.",
    "Renisenb sometimes wondered how it was that Henet always\ncontrived to know all about everything.",
    "Kameni it seemed was a young scribe in Imhoteps employ  the son of one of Imhoteps\ncousins.",
    "Kameni had discovered certain fraudulent dispositions  a falsifying of the\naccounts and since the matter had many ramifications and involved the stewards of the\nproperty he had thought it best to come south in person to report.",
    "Renisenb was not much interested.",
    "It was clever she thought of Kameni to have\ndiscovered all this.",
    "Her father would be pleased with him.",
    "The immediate outcome of the matter was that Imhotep made hurried preparations for\ndeparture.",
    "He had not meant to leave for another two months but now the sooner he was\non the spot the better.",
    "The whole household was summoned and innumerable exortions and recommendations\nwere made.",
    "This was to be done and that.",
    "Yahmose was on no account to do such and such\na thing.",
    "Sobek was to exercise the utmost discretion over something else.",
    "It was all\nRenisenb thought very familiar.",
    "Yahmose was attentive Sobek was sulky.",
    "Hori as usual\nwas calm and efficient.",
    "Ipys demands and importunities were put aside with more\nsharpness than usual.",
    "You are too young to have a separate allowance.",
    "Obey Yahmose.",
    "He knows my wishes and\ncommands.",
    "Imhotep placed a hand on his eldest sons shoulder.",
    "I trust you Yahmose.",
    "When I return we will speak once more of a partnership.",
    "Yahmose flushed quickly with pleasure.",
    "He drew himself a little more erect.",
    "Imhotep went on\nSee only that all goes well in my absence.",
    "See to it that my concubine is welltreated  and\nwith due honor and respect.",
    "She is in your charge.",
    "It is for you to control the conduct of the\nwomen of the household.",
    "See that Satipy curbs her tongue.",
    "See also that Sobek duly\ninstructs Kait.",
    "Renisenb also must act toward Nofret with courtesy.",
    "Then I will have no\nunkindness shown toward our good Henet.",
    "The women I know find her tiresome\nsometimes.",
    "She has been here long and thinks herself privileged to say many things that are\nsometimes unwelcome.",
    "She has I know neither beauty nor wit  but she is faithful\nremember and has always been devoted to my interests.",
    "I will not have her despised and\nabused.",
    "Everything shall be done as you say said Yahmose.",
    "But Henet sometimes makes\ntrouble with her tongue.",
    "Pah Nonsense All women do.",
    "Not Henet more than another.",
    "Now as to Kameni he shall\nremain here.",
    "We can do with another scribe and he can assist Hori.",
    "As for that land that we\nhave rented to the woman Yaii \n\n\fImhotep went off into meticulous details.",
    "When at last all was ready for the departure Imhotep felt a sudden qualm.",
    "He took Nofret\naside and said doubtfully\nNofret are you content to remain here Would it be perhaps best if after all you came\nwith me\nNofret shook her head and smiled.",
    "You will not be long absent she said.",
    "Three months  perhaps four.",
    "Who knows\nYou see  it will not be long.",
    "I shall be content here.",
    "Imhotep said fussily\nI have enjoined upon Yahmose  upon all my sons  that you are to have every\nconsideration.",
    "On their heads be it if you have anything of which to complain\nThey will do as you say I am sure Imhotep.",
    "Nofret paused.",
    "Then she said Who is\nthere here whom I can trust absolutely Someone who is truly devoted to your interests I\ndo not mean one of the family.",
    "Hori  my good Hori He is in every way my right hand  and a man of good sense and\ndiscrimination.",
    "Nofret said slowly\nHe and Yahmose are like brothers.",
    "Perhaps \nThere is Kameni.",
    "He too is a scribe.",
    "I will enjoin on him to place himself at your service.",
    "If you have anything of which to complain he will write down your words with his pen and\ndispatch the complaint to me.",
    "Nofret nodded appreciatively.",
    "That is a good thought.",
    "Kameni comes from the north.",
    "He knows my father.",
    "He will not\nbe influenced by family considerations.",
    "And Henet exclaimed Imhotep.",
    "There is Henet.",
    "Yes said Nofret reflectively.",
    "There is Henet.",
    "Suppose that you were to speak to her now\n in front of me\nAn excellent plan.",
    "Henet was sent for and came with her usual cringing eagerness.",
    "She was full of\nlamentations over Imhoteps departure.",
    "Imhotep cut her short with abruptness.",
    "Yes yes my good Henet  but these things must be.",
    "I am a man who can seldom count on\nany stretch of peace or rest.",
    "I must toil ceaselessly for my family  little though they\nsometimes appreciate it.",
    "Now I wish to speak to you very seriously.",
    "You love me faithfully\nand devotedly I know.",
    "I can leave you in a position of trust.",
    "Guard Nofret here  she is very\ndear to me.",
    "Whoever is dear to you master is dear to me Henet declared with fervor.",
    "Very good.",
    "Then you will devote yourself to Nofrets interests\nHenet turned towards Nofret who was watching her under lowered lids.",
    "You are too beautiful Nofret she said.",
    "That is the trouble.",
    "That is why the others are\njealous  but I will look after you  I will warn you of all they say and do.",
    "You can count on\nme\nThere was a pause whilst the eyes of the two women met.",
    "You can count on me Henet repeated.",
    "A slow smile came to Nofrets lips  a rather curious smile.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "I understand you Henet.",
    "I think I can count on you.",
    "Imhotep cleared his throat noisily.",
    "Then I think all is arranged  yes  everything is satisfactory.",
    "Organization  that has\nalways been my strong point.",
    "There was a dry cackle of laughter and Imhotep turned sharply to see his mother standing\nin the entrance of the room.",
    "She was supporting her weight on a stick and looked more\ndried up and malevolent than ever.",
    "What a wonderful son I have she observed.",
    "I must not delay  there are some instructions to Hori \nMuttering importantly Imhotep hurried from the room.",
    "He managed to avoid meeting his\nmothers eye.",
    "Esa gave an imperious nod of the head to Henet  and Henet glided obediently out of the\nroom.",
    "Nofret had risen.",
    "She and Esa stood looking at each other.",
    "Esa said\nSo my son is leaving you behind You had better go with him Nofret.",
    "He wishes me to stay here.",
    "Nofrets voice was soft and submissive.",
    "Esa gave a shrill chuckle.",
    "Little good that would be if you wanted to go And why do you not want to go I do not\nunderstand you.",
    "What is there for you here You are a girl who has lived in cities  who has\nperhaps traveled.",
    "Why do you choose the monotony of day after day here  amongst those\nwho  I am frank  do not like you  who in fact dislike you\nSo you dislike me\nEsa shook her head.",
    "No  I do not dislike you.",
    "I am old and though I can see but dimly  I can still see beauty\nand enjoy it.",
    "You are beautiful Nofret and the sight of you pleases my old eyes.",
    "Because of\nyour beauty I wish you well.",
    "I am warning you.",
    "Go north with my son.",
    "Again Nofret repeated\nHe wishes me to stay here.",
    "The submissive tone was now definitely impregnated with mockery.",
    "Esa said sharply\nYou have a purpose in remaining here.",
    "What is it I wonder Very well on your own head\nbe it.",
    "But be careful.",
    "Act discreetly.",
    "And trust no one.",
    "She wheeled abruptly and went out.",
    "Nofret stood quite still.",
    "Very slowly her lips curved\nupwards in a wide catlike smile.",
    "Chapter 6\nFIRST MONTH OF WINTER 4TH DAY\nRenisenb had got into the habit of going up to the Tomb almost every day.",
    "Sometimes\nYahmose and Hori would he there together sometimes Hori alone sometimes there would\nbe no one  but always Renisenb was aware of a curious relief and peace  a feeling almost\nof escape.",
    "She liked it best when Hori was there alone.",
    "There was something in his gravity\nhis incurious acceptance of her coming that gave her a strange feeling of contentment.",
    "She\nwould sit in the shade of the rock chamber entrance with one knee raised and her hands\nclasped around it and stare out over the green belt of cultivation to where the Nile showed\na pale gleaming blue and beyond it to a distance of pale soft fawns and creams and pinks\nall melting hazily into each other.",
    "She had come the first time months ago now on a sudden wish to escape from a world of\nintense femininity.",
    "She wanted stillness and companionship  and she had found them here.",
    "The wish to escape was still with her but it was no longer a mere revulsion from the stress\nand fret of domesticity.",
    "It was something more definite more alarming.",
    "She said to Hori one day I am afraid...\nWhy are you afraid Renisenb He studied her gravely.",
    "Renisenb took a minute or two\nto think.",
    "Then she said slowly\nDo you remember saying to me once that there were two evils  one that came from\nwithout and one from within\nYes I remember.",
    "You were speaking so you said afterwards about diseases that attack fruit and crops but\nI have been thinking  it is the same with people.",
    "Hori nodded slowly.",
    "So you have found that out...",
    "Yes you are right Renisenb.",
    "Renisenb said abruptly\nIt is happening now  down there at the house.",
    "Evil has come  from outside And I know\nwho has brought it.",
    "It is Nofret.",
    "Hori said slowly\nYou think so\nRenisenb nodded vigorously.",
    "Yes yes I know what I am talking about.",
    "Listen Hori when I came up to you here and\nsaid that everything was the same even to Satipy and Kait quarreling  that was true.",
    "But\nthose quarrels Hori were not real quarrels.",
    "I mean Satipy and Kait enjoyed them  they\nmade the time pass  neither of the women felt any real anger against each other But now\nit is different.",
    "Now they do not just say things that are rude and unpleasant  they say\nthings that they mean shall hurt  and when they have seen that a thing hurts then they are\nglad It is horrid Hori  horrid Yesterday Satipy was so angry that she ran a long gold pin\ninto Kaits arm  and a day or two ago Kait dropped a heavy copper pan full of boiling fat\nover Satipys foot.",
    "And it is the same everywhere  Satipy rails at Yahmose far into the\nnight  we can all hear her.",
    "Yahmose looks sick and tired and hunted.",
    "And Sobek goes off\nto the village and stays there with women and comes back drunk and shouts and boasts\nand says how clever he is\nSome of these things are true I know said Hori slowly.",
    "But why should you blame\nNofret\nBecause it is her doing It is always the things she says  little things  clever things  that\nstart it all.",
    "She is like the goad with which you prick oxen.",
    "She is clever too in knowing\njust what to say.",
    "Sometimes I think it is Henet who tells her...",
    "Yes said Hori thoughtfully.",
    "That might well be.",
    "Renisenb shivered.",
    "I dont like Henet.",
    "I hate the way she creeps about.",
    "She is so devoted to us all and yet\nnone of us want her devotion.",
    "How could my mother have brought her here and been so\nfond of her\nWe have only Henets word for that said Hori dryly.",
    "Why should Henet be so fond of Nofret and follow her round and whisper and fawn upon\nher Oh Hori I tell you I am afraid I hate Nofret I wish she would go away.",
    "She is\nbeautiful and cruel and bad\n\n\fWhat a child you are Renisenb.",
    "Then Hori added quietly\nNofret is coming up here now.",
    "Renisenb turned her head.",
    "Together they watched Nofret come slowly up the steep path\nthat led up the cliff face.",
    "She was smiling to herself and humming a little tune under her\nbreath.",
    "When she reached the place where they were she looked round her and smiled.",
    "It was a\nsmile of amused curiosity.",
    "So this is where you slip away to every day Renisenb.",
    "Renisenb did not answer.",
    "She had the angry defeated feeling of a child whose refuge has\nbeen discovered.",
    "Nofret looked about her again.",
    "And this is the famous Tomb\nAs you say Nofret said Hori.",
    "She looked at him her catlike mouth curving into a smile.",
    "Ive no doubt you find it profitable Hori.",
    "You are a good man of business so I hear.",
    "There was a tinge of malice in her voice but Hori remained unmoved smiling his quiet\ngrave smile.",
    "It is profitable to all of us... Death is always profitable...\nNofret gave a quick shiver as she looked round her her eyes sweeping over the offering\ntables the entrance to the shrine and the false door.",
    "She cried sharply\nI hate death\nYou should not.",
    "Horis tone was quiet.",
    "Death is the chief source of wealth here in\nEgypt.",
    "Death bought the jewels you wear Nofret.",
    "Death feeds you and clothes you.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "What do you mean\nI mean that Imhotep is a kapriest  a mortuary priest  all his lands all his cattle his\ntimber his flax his barley are the endowment of a Tomb.",
    "He paused and then went on reflectively\nWe are a strange people we Egyptians.",
    "We love life  and so we start very early to plan\nfor death.",
    "That is where the wealth of Egypt goes  into pyramids into tombs into tomb\nendowments.",
    "Nofret said violently\nWill you stop talking about death Hori I do not like it.",
    "Because you are truly Egyptian  because you love life because  some times  you feel the\nshadow of death very near...\nStop\nShe turned on him violently.",
    "Then shrugging her shoulders she turned away and began to\ndescend the path.",
    "Renisenb breathed a sigh of satisfaction.",
    "I am glad she has gone she said childishly.",
    "You frightened her Hori.",
    "Yes... Did I frighten you Renisenb\nNno.",
    "Renisenb sounded a little unsure.",
    "It is true what you said only I had never\nthought of it that way before.",
    "My father is a mortuary priest.",
    "Hori said with sudden bitterness\n\n\fAll Egypt is obsessed by death And do you know why Renisenb Because we have eyes in\nour bodies but none in our minds.",
    "We cannot conceive of a life other than this one  of a\nlife after death.",
    "We can visualize only a continuation of what we know.",
    "We have no real\nbelief in a God.",
    "Renisenb stared at him in amazement.",
    "How can you say that Hori Why we have many many Gods  so many that I could not\nname them all.",
    "Only last night we were saying all of us which Gods we preferred.",
    "Sobek\nwas all for Sakhmet and Kait prays always to Meskhent.",
    "Kameni swears by Thoth as is\nnatural being a scribe.",
    "Satipy is for the falconheaded Horus and also for our own\nMeresger.",
    "Yahmose says that Ptah is to be worshipped because he made all things.",
    "I myself\nlove Isis.",
    "And Henet is all for our local God Amun.",
    "She says that there are prophecies\namongst the priests that one day Amun will be the greatest God in all Egypt  so she takes\nhim offerings now while he is still a small God.",
    "And there is Re the Sun God and Osiris\nbefore whom the hearts of the dead are weighed.",
    "Renisenb paused out of breath.",
    "Hori was smiling at her.",
    "And what is the difference Renisenb between a God and a man\nShe stared at him.",
    "The Gods are  they are magic\nThat is all\nI dont know what you mean Hori.",
    "I meant that to you a God is only a man or a woman who can do certain things that men\nand women cannot do.",
    "You say such odd things I cannot understand you.",
    "She looked at him with a puzzled face  then glancing down over the valley her attention\nwas caught by something else.",
    "Look she exclaimed.",
    "Nofret is talking to Sobek.",
    "She is laughing.",
    "Oh  she gave a\nsudden gasp  no it is nothing.",
    "I thought he was going to strike her.",
    "She is going back to\nthe house and he is coming up here.",
    "Sobek arrived looking like a thundercloud.",
    "May a crocodile devour that woman he cried.",
    "My father was more of a fool than usual\nwhen he took her for a concubine\nWhat did she say to you asked Hori curiously.",
    "She insulted me as usual Asked if my father had entrusted me with the sale of any more\ntimber.",
    "Id like to strangle her.",
    "He moved along the platform and picking up a piece of rock threw it down to the valley\nbelow.",
    "The sound of it bouncing off the cliff seemed to please him.",
    "He levered up a larger\npiece then sprang back as a snake that had been coiled up beneath it raised its head.",
    "It\nreared up hissing and Renisenb saw that it was a cobra.",
    "Catching up a heavy staff Sobek attacked it furiously.",
    "A welldirected blow broke its back\nbut Sobek continued to slash at it his head thrown back his eyes sparkling and below his\nbreath he muttered some word which Renisenb only half heard and did not recognize.",
    "She cried out\nStop Sobek stop  it is dead\nSobek paused then he threw the staff away and laughed.",
    "One poisonous snake the less in the world.",
    "He laughed again his good humor restored and clattered off down the path again.",
    "Renisenb said in a low voice I believe Sobek  likes killing things\nYes.",
    "There was no surprise in the word.",
    "Hori was merely acknowledging a fact which he\nevidently already knew well.",
    "Renisenb turned to stare at him.",
    "She said slowly\nSnakes are dangerous  but how beautiful that cobra looked...\nShe stared down at its broken twisted body.",
    "For some unknown reason she felt a pang at\nher heart.",
    "Hori said dreamily\nI remember when we were all small children  Sobek attacked Yahmose.",
    "Yahmose was a\nyear older but Sobek was the bigger and the stronger.",
    "He had a stone and he was banging\nYahmoses head with it.",
    "Your mother came running and tore them apart.",
    "I remember how\nshe stood looking down at Yahmose  and how she cried out You must not do things like\nthat Sobek  it is dangerous I tell you it is dangerous He paused and went on She was\nvery beautiful...",
    "I thought so as a child.",
    "You are like her Renisenb.",
    "Am I Renisenb felt pleased  warmed.",
    "Then she asked Was Yahmose badly hurt\nNo it was not as bad as it looked.",
    "Sobek was very ill the next day.",
    "It might have been\nsomething he ate but your mother said it was his rage and the hot sun  it was the middle\nof summer.",
    "Sobek has a terrible temper said Renisenb thoughtfully.",
    "She looked again at the dead snake and turned away with a shiver.",
    "II\nWhen Renisenb got back to the house Kameni was sitting on the front porch with a roll of\npapyrus.",
    "He was singing and she paused a minute and listened to the words.",
    "I will go to Memphis sang Kameni I will go to Ptah Lord of Truth.",
    "I will say to Ptah\nGive me my sister tonight.",
    "The stream is wine Ptah is its reeds Sakhmet its lotus Earit\nits bud Nefertem its flower.",
    "I will say to Ptah Give me my sister tonight.",
    "The dawn breaks\nthrough her beauty.",
    "Memphis is a dish of love apples set before the fair of face.",
    "He looked up and smiled at Renisenb.",
    "Do you like my song Renisenb\nWhat is it\nIt is a love song from Memphis.",
    "He kept his eyes on her singing softly\nHer arms are full of branches of the persea her hair is weighed down with unguent.",
    "She is\nlike a Princess of the Lord of the Two Lands.",
    "The color came up in Renisenbs face.",
    "She passed on quickly into the house and almost\ncollided with Nofret.",
    "Why are you in such a hurry Renisenb\nNofrets voice had a sharp edge to it.",
    "Renisenb looked at her in faint surprise.",
    "Nofret was\nnot smiling.",
    "Her face looked grim and tense and Renisenb noticed that her hands were\nclenched at her sides.",
    "I am sorry Nofret.",
    "I did not see you.",
    "It is dark in here when you come from the light\noutside.",
    "Yes it is dark here... Nofret paused a moment.",
    "It would be pleasanter outside  on the\nporch  with Kamenis singing to listen to.",
    "He sings well does he not\n\n\fYes  yes I am sure he does.",
    "Yet you did not stay to listen Kameni will be disappointed.",
    "Renisenbs cheeks felt hot again.",
    "Nofrets cold sneering glance made her uncomfortable.",
    "Do you not like love songs Renisenb\nDoes it matter to you Nofret what I like or do not like\nSo little cats have claws.",
    "What do you mean\nNofret laughed.",
    "You are not such a fool as you look Renisenb.",
    "So you find Kameni\nhandsome Well that will please him no doubt.",
    "I think you are quite odious said Renisenb passionately.",
    "She ran past Nofret towards the back of the house.",
    "She heard the girls mocking laugh.",
    "But\nthrough that laugh sounding clearly in her memory was the echo of Kamenis voice and\nthe song that he had sung with his eyes watching her face...\nIII\nThat night Renisenb had a dream.",
    "She was with Khay sailing with him in the Barque of the Dead in the Underworld.",
    "Khay\nwas standing in the bows of the boat  she could only see the back of his head.",
    "Then as they\ndrew near to sunrise Khay turned his head and Renisenb saw that it was not Khay but\nKameni.",
    "And at the same time the prow of the barque the serpents head began to writhe.",
    "It was a live serpent a cobra and Renisenb thought It is the serpent that comes out in the\nTombs to eat the souls of the dead.",
    "She was paralyzed with fear.",
    "And then she saw that\nthe serpents face was the face of Nofret and she woke up screaming Nofret  Nofret...\nShe had not really screamed  it was all in the dream.",
    "She lay still her heart beating telling\nherself that none of all this was real.",
    "And then she thought suddenly That is what Sobek\nsaid when he was killing the snake yesterday.",
    "He said Nofret...\nChapter 7\nFIRST MONTH OF WINTER 5TH DAY\nRenisenbs dream had left her wakeful.",
    "She slept after it only in snatches and towards\nmorning she did not sleep at all.",
    "She was obsessed by an obscure feeling of impending evil.",
    "She rose early and went out of the house.",
    "Her steps led her as they did so often to the Nile.",
    "There were fishermen out already and a big barge rowing with powerful strokes towards\nThebes.",
    "There were other boats with sails flapping in the faint puffs of wind.",
    "Something turned over in Renisenbs heart  the stirring of a desire for something she could\nnot name.",
    "She thought I feel  I feel  But she did not know what it was that she felt\nThat is to say she knew no words to fit the sensation.",
    "She thought I want  but what do I\nwant\nWas it Khay she wanted Khay was dead  he would not come back.",
    "She said to herself I\nshall not think of Khay any more.",
    "What is the use It is over all that.",
    "Then she noticed another figure standing looking after the barge that was making for\nThebes  and something forlorn about that figure  some emotion it expressed by its very\nmotionlessness struck Renisenb even as she recognised Nofret.",
    "Nofret staring out at the Nile.",
    "Nofret  alone.",
    "Nofret thinking of  what\n\n\fWith a little shock Renisenb suddenly realized how little they all knew about Nofret.",
    "They\nhad accepted her as an enemy  a stranger  without interest or curiosity in her life or the\nsurroundings from which she had come.",
    "It must Renisenb thought suddenly be sad for Nofret alone here without friends\nsurrounded only by people who disliked her.",
    "Slowly Renisenb went forward until she was standing by Nofrets side.",
    "Nofret turned her\nhead for a moment then moved it back again and resumed her study of the Nile.",
    "Her face\nwas expressionless.",
    "Renisenb said timidly\nThere are a lot of boats on the River.",
    "Yes.",
    "Renisenb went on obeying some obscure impulse towards friendliness\nIs it like this at all where you come from\nNofret laughed a short rather bitter laugh.",
    "No indeed.",
    "My father is a merchant in Memphis.",
    "It is gay and amusing in Memphis.",
    "There are music and singing and dancing.",
    "Then my father travels a good deal.",
    "I have been\nwith him to Syria  to Byblos beyond the Gazelles Nose.",
    "I have been with him in a big ship\non the wide seas.",
    "She spoke with pride and animation.",
    "Renisenb stood quite still her mind working slowly but with growing interest and\nunderstanding.",
    "It must be very dull for you here she said slowly.",
    "Nofret laughed impatiently.",
    "It is dead here  dead  nothing but ploughing and sowing and reaping and grazing  and\ntalk of crops  and wanglings about the price of flax.",
    "Renisenb was still wrestling with unfamiliar thoughts as she watched Nofret sideways.",
    "And suddenly as though it was something physical a great wave of anger and misery and\ndespair seemed to emanate from the girl at her side.",
    "Renisenb thought She is as young as I am  younger.",
    "And she is the concubine of that old\nman that fussy kindly but rather ridiculous old man my father...\nWhat did she Renisenb know about Nofret Nothing at all.",
    "What was it Hori had said\nyesterday when she had cried out She is beautiful and cruel and bad\nYou are a child Renisenb.",
    "That was what he had said.",
    "Renisenb knew now what he\nmeant.",
    "Those words of hers had meant nothing  you could not dismiss a human being so\neasily.",
    "What sorrow what bitterness what despair lay behind Nofrets cruel smile What\nhad Renisenb what had any of them done to make Nofret welcome\nRenisenb said stumblingly childishly\nYou hate us all  I see why  we have not been kind  but now  it is not too late.",
    "Can we\nnot you and I Nofret can we not be sisters to each other You are far away from all you\nknow  you are alone  can I not help\nHer words faltered into silence.",
    "Nofret turned slowly\nFor a minute or two her face was expressionless  there was even Renisenb thought a\nmomentary softening in her eyes.",
    "In that early morning stillness with its strange clarity\nand peace it was as though Nofret hesitated  as though Renisenbs words had touched in\nher some last core of irresolution.",
    "It was a strange moment a moment Renisenb was to remember afterwards....\n\n\fThen gradually Nofrets expression changed.",
    "It became heavily malevolent her eyes\nsmoldered.",
    "Before the fury of hate and malice in her glance Renisenb recoiled a step\nNofret said in a low fierce voice\nGo I want nothing from any of you.",
    "Stupid fools that is what you all are every one of\nyou...\nShe paused a moment then wheeled round and retraced her steps towards the house\nwalking with energy.",
    "Renisenb followed her slowly.",
    "Curiously enough Nofrets words had not made her angry.",
    "They had opened before her eyes a black abyss of hate and misery  something quite\nunknown as yet in her own experience and in her mind was only a confused groping\nthought of how dreadful it must be to feel like that.",
    "II\nAs Nofret entered the gateway and crossed the courtyard one of Kaits children came\nrunning across her path chasing a ball.",
    "Nofret pushed the child out of her way with an angry thrust that sent the little girl\nsprawling on the ground.",
    "The child set up a wail and Renisenb ran to her and picked her\nup saying indignantly\nYou should not have done that Nofret You have hurt her see.",
    "She has cut her chin.",
    "Nofret laughed stridently.",
    "So I should be careful not to hurt these spoiled brats Why Are their mothers so careful\nof my feelings\nKait had come running out of the house at the sound of her childs wails.",
    "She ran to it\nexamining the injured face.",
    "Then she turned on Nofret.",
    "Devil and serpent Evil one Wait and see what we will do to you.",
    "With all the force of her arm she struck Nofret in the face.",
    "Renisenb gave a cry and caught\nher arm before she could repeat the blow.",
    "Kait  Kait  you must not do that.",
    "Who says so Let Nofret look to herself.",
    "She is only one here among many.",
    "Nofret stood quite still.",
    "The print of Kaits hand showed clear and red on her check.",
    "By the\ncorner of the eye where a bangle Kait wore on her wrist had cut the skin a small trickle of\nblood was running down her face.",
    "But it was Nofrets expression that puzzled Renisenb  yes and frightened her.",
    "Nofret\nshowed no anger.",
    "Instead there was a queer exultant look in her eyes and once more her\nmouth was curving up in its catlike satisfied smile.",
    "Thank you Kait she said.",
    "Then she walked on into the house.",
    "III\nHumming softly under her breath her eyelids lowered Nofret called Henet.",
    "Henet came running stopped exclaimed.",
    "Nofret cut short her exclamations.",
    "Fetch me Kameni.",
    "Tell him to bring his pen case and ink and papyrus.",
    "There is a letter to\nbe written to the master.",
    "Henets eyes were fixed on Nofrets cheek.",
    "To the master  I see...\nThen she asked\nWho did  that\nKait.",
    "Nofret smiled quietly and reminiscently.",
    "Henet shook her head and clicked her tongue.",
    "All this is very bad  very bad...",
    "Certainly the master must know of it.",
    "She darted a\nquick sideways look at Nofret.",
    "Yes certainly Imhotep must know.",
    "Nofret said smoothly\nYou and I Henet think alike...",
    "I thought that we should do so.",
    "From the corner of her linen robe she detached a jewel of amethyst set in gold and placed it\nin the womans hand.",
    "You and I Henet have Imhoteps true welfare at heart.",
    "This is too good for me Nofret... You are too generous... such a lovely bit of\nworkmanship.",
    "Imhotep and I appreciate fidelity.",
    "Nofret was still smiling her eyes narrow and catlike.",
    "Fetch Kameni she said.",
    "And come with him.",
    "You and he together are witnesses of what\nhas occurred.",
    "Kameni came a little unwillingly his brow puckered.",
    "Nofret spoke imperiously\nYou remember Imhoteps instructions  before he left\nYes said Kameni.",
    "The time has come said Nofret.",
    "Sit and take ink and write as I tell you.",
    "Then as\nKameni still hesitated she said impatiently What you write shall be what you have seen\nwith your own eyes and heard with your own ears  and Henet shall confirm all I say.",
    "The\nletter must be dispatched with all secrecy and speed.",
    "Kameni said slowly I do not like \nNofret flashed out at him\nI have no complaint against Renisenb.",
    "Renisenb is soft weak and a fool but she has not\ntried to harm me.",
    "Does that content you\nThe color of Kamenis bronze face deepened.",
    "I was not thinking of that \nNofret said smoothly\nI think you were... Come now  fulfill your instructions  write.",
    "Yes write said Henet.",
    "Im so distressed by all this  so terribly distressed.",
    "Certainly\nImhotep must know about it.",
    "Its only right that he should.",
    "However unpleasant a thing is\none has to do ones duty.",
    "Ive always felt that.",
    "Nofret laughed softly.",
    "Im sure you have Henet.",
    "You shall do your duty And Kameni shall do his office.",
    "And I I shall do what it is my pleasure to do...",
    "But still Kameni hesitated.",
    "His face was sullen  almost angry.",
    "I do not like this he said.",
    "Nofret you had better take a little time to think.",
    "You say that to me Kameni flushed at her tone.",
    "His eyes avoided hers but his sullen\nexpression remained.",
    "Be careful Kameni said Nofret smoothly.",
    "I have great influence with Imhotep.",
    "He\nlistens to what I say  so far he has been pleased with you  She paused significantly.",
    "Are you threatening me Nofret asked Kameni angrily.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "He looked angrily at her for a moment or two  then he bent his head.",
    "I will do as you say Nofret but I think  yes I think  that you will be sorry.",
    "Are you threatening me Kameni\nI am warning you...\nChapter 8\nSECOND MONTH OF WINTER 10TH DAY\nDay followed day and Renisenb sometimes felt that she was living in a dream.",
    "She had made no more timid overtures to Nofret.",
    "She was now afraid of Nofret.",
    "There\nwas something about Nofret she did not understand.",
    "After the scene in the courtyard that day Nofret had changed.",
    "There was a complacency\nabout her an exultation that Renisenb could not fathom.",
    "Sometimes she thought that her\nown vision of Nofret as profoundly unhappy must have been ridiculously wrong.",
    "Nofret\nseemed pleased with life and herself and her surroundings.",
    "And yet actually her surroundings had very definitely changed for the worse.",
    "In the days\nfollowing Imhoteps departure Nofret had quite deliberately Renisenb thought set out to\nsow dissension between the various members of Imhoteps family.",
    "Now that family had closed its ranks solidly against the invader.",
    "There were no more\ndissensions between Satipy and Kait  no railing of Satipy against the unfortunate\nYahmose.",
    "Sobek seemed quieter and boasted less.",
    "Ipy was less impudent and offhand with\nhis elder brothers.",
    "There seemed a new harmony between the family  yet this harmony did\nnot bring peace of mind to Renisenb  for with it went a curious persistent undercurrent of\nillwill to Nofret.",
    "The two women Satipy and Kait no longer quarreled with her  they avoided her.",
    "They\nnever spoke to her and wherever she came they immediately gathered the children\ntogether and went elsewhere.",
    "At the same time queer annoying little accidents began to\nhappen.",
    "A linen dress of Nofrets was spoilt with an overhot iron  some dyestuff was spilt\nover another.",
    "Sometimes sharp thorns found their way into her clothing  a scorpion was\ndiscovered by her bed.",
    "The food that was served to her was overseasoned  or lacking in\nany seasoning.",
    "There was a dead mouse one day in her portion of bread.",
    "It was a quiet relentless petty persecution  nothing open nothing to lay hold of  it was\nessentially a womans campaign.",
    "Then one day old Esa sent for Satipy Kait and Renisenb.",
    "Henet was already there\nshaking her head and rubbing her hands in the background.",
    "Ha said Esa peering at them with her usual ironical expression.",
    "So here are my clever\ngranddaughters.",
    "What do you think you are doing all of you What is this I hear about\nNofrets dress being ruined  and her food uneatable\nSatipy and Kait both smiled.",
    "They were not nice smiles.",
    "Satipy said Has Nofret complained\nNo said Esa.",
    "She pushed the wig she always wore even in the house a little awry with\none hand.",
    "No Nofret has not complained.",
    "That is what worries me.",
    "It does not worry me said Satipy tossing her handsome head.",
    "Because you are a fool snapped Esa.",
    "Nofret has twice the brains of any of you three.",
    "That remains to be seen said Satipy.",
    "She looked goodhumored and pleased with herself.",
    "What do you think you are all doing inquired Esa.",
    "Satipys face hardened.",
    "You are an old woman Esa.",
    "I do not speak with any lack of respect  but things no longer\nmatter to you in the way they matter to us who have husbands and young children.",
    "We\nhave decided to take matters into our own hands  we have ways of dealing with a woman\nwhom we do not like and will not accept.",
    "Fine words said Esa.",
    "Fine words.",
    "She cackled.",
    "But a good discourse can be found\nwith slave girls over the millstone.",
    "A true and wise saying sighed Henet from the background.",
    "Esa turned on her.",
    "Come Henet what does Nofret say to all this that is going on You should know  you are\nalways waiting on her.",
    "As Imhotep told me to do.",
    "It is repugnant to me of course  but I must do what the master\nordered.",
    "You do not think I hope \nEsa cut into the whining voice\nWe know all about you Henet.",
    "Always devoted  and seldom thanked as you should be.",
    "What does Nofret say to all this That is what I asked you.",
    "Henet shook her head.",
    "She says nothing.",
    "She just  smiles.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Esa picked up a jujube from a dish at her elbow examined it and put it in her\nmouth.",
    "Then she said with sudden malevolent acerbity\nYou are fools all of you.",
    "The power is with Nofret not with you.",
    "All you are doing is to\nplay into her hands.",
    "I dare swear it even pleases her what you are doing.",
    "Satipy said sharply\nNonsense.",
    "Nofret is alone amongst many.",
    "What power has she\nEsa said grimly\nThe power of a young beautiful woman married to an ageing man.",
    "I know what I am\ntalking about.",
    "With a quick turn of her head she said Henet knows what I am talking\nabout\nHenet started.",
    "She sighed and began to twist her hands.",
    "The master thinks a great deal of her  naturally  yes quite naturally.",
    "Go to the kitchen said Esa.",
    "Bring me some dates and some Syrian wine  yes and\nhoney too.",
    "When Henet had gone the old woman said\nThere is mischief brewing  I can smell it.",
    "Satipy you are the leader in all this.",
    "Be careful\nthat while you are thinking yourself clever you do not play into Nofrets hands.",
    "She leaned back and closed her eyes.",
    "I have warned you  now go.",
    "We in Nofrets power indeed said Satipy with a toss of her head as they went out to the\nlake.",
    "Esa is so old she gets the most extraordinary ideas into her head.",
    "It is we who have\ngot Nofret in our power We will do nothing against her that can be reported  but I think\nyes I think that she will soon be sorry she ever came here.",
    "You are cruel  cruel  cried Renisenb.",
    "Satipy looked amused.",
    "Do not pretend you love Nofret Renisenb\n\n\fI do not.",
    "But you sound so  so vindictive.",
    "I think of my children  and Yahmose I am not a meek woman or one who brooks insult and I have ambition.",
    "I would wring that womans neck with the greatest of pleasure.",
    "Unfortunately it is not so simple as that.",
    "Imhoteps anger must not be aroused.",
    "But I think in the end  something may be managed.",
    "II\nThe letter came like a spear thrust to a fish.",
    "Dumbfounded silent Yahmose Sobek and Ipy stared at Hori as he read out the words\nfrom the papyrus scroll.",
    "Did I not tell Yahmose that I would hold him to blame if any harm came to my\nconcubine As you all live I am against you and you are against me I will no longer live\nwith you in one house since you have not respected my concubine Nofret You are no\nlonger my son of my flesh.",
    "Neither are Sobek and Ipy my sons of my flesh.",
    "Each one of you\nhas done harm to my concubine.",
    "That is attested by Kameni and Henet.",
    "I will turn you out\nof my house  each of you I have supported you  now I will no longer support you.",
    "Hori paused and went on\nThe kaservant Imhotep addresses Hori.",
    "To you who have been faithful how are you in\nyour life safety and health Salute my mother Esa for me and my daughter Renisenb and\ngreet Henet.",
    "Look after my affairs carefully until I reach you and see that there be\nprepared for me a deed whereby my concubine Nofret shall share with me in all my\nproperty as my wife.",
    "Neither Yahmose nor Sobek shall be associated with me nor will I\nsupport them and hereby I denounce them that they have done harm to my concubine\nKeep all safe till I come.",
    "How evil it is when a mans household do evil deeds to his\nconcubine.",
    "As for Ipy let him take warning and if he does a single hurt to my concubine\nhe too shall depart from my house.",
    "There was a paralyzed silence then Sobek rose up in a violent rage.",
    "How has this come about What has my father heard Who has been bearing false tales to\nhim Shall we endure this My father cannot disinherit us so and give all his goods to his\nconcubine\nHori said mildly\nIt will cause unfavorable comment  and it will not be accepted as a right action  but\nlegally it is in his power.",
    "He can make a deed of settlement in any way he wishes.",
    "She has bewitched him  that black jeering serpent has put a spell upon him\nYahmose murmured as though dumbfounded\nIt is unbelievable  it cannot be true.",
    "My father is mad  mad cried Ipy.",
    "He turns even against me at this womans bidding\nHori said gravely\nImhotep will return shortly  that he says.",
    "By then his anger may have abated he may not\nreally mean to do as he says.",
    "There was a short unpleasant laugh.",
    "It was Satipy who had\nlaughed.",
    "She stood looking at them from the doorway into the womens quarters.",
    "So that is what we are to do is it most excellent Hori Wait and see\nYahmose said slowly\nWhat else can we do\nWhat else Satipys voice rose.",
    "She screamed out What have you got in your veins all\n\n\fof you Milk Yahmose I know is not a man But you Sobek  have you no remedy for\nthese ills A knife in the heart and the girl could do us no more harm.",
    "Satipy cried Yahmose.",
    "My father would never forgive us\nSo you say.",
    "But I tell you a dead concubine is not the same as a live concubine Once she\nwas dead his heart would return to his sons and their children.",
    "And besides how should he\nknow how she died We could say a scorpion stung her We are all together in this are we\nnot\nYahmose said slowly\nMy father would know.",
    "Henet would tell him.",
    "Satipy gave a hysterical laugh.",
    "Most prudent Yahmose Most gentle cautious Yahmose It is you who should look after\nthe children and do womans work in the back of the house.",
    "Sakhmet help me Married to\na man who is not a man.",
    "And you Sobek for all your bluster what courage have you what\ndetermination I swear by Re I am a better man than either of you.",
    "She swung round and went out.",
    "Kait who had been standing behind her came a step forward.",
    "She said her voice deep and shaken\nIt is true what Satipy says She is a better man than any of you.",
    "Yahmose Sobek Ipy will you all sit here doing nothing What of our children Sobek Cast out to starve Very\nwell if you will do nothing.",
    "I will.",
    "You are none of you men\nAs she in turn went out Sobek sprang to his feet.",
    "By the Nine Gods of the Ennead.",
    "Kait is right There is a mans work to be done  and we\nsit here talking and shaking our heads.",
    "He strode towards the door.",
    "Hori called after him\nSobek Sobek where are you going What are you going to do\nSobek handsome and fierce shouted from the doorway\nI shall do something  that is clear.",
    "And what I do I shall enjoy doing\nChapter 9\nSECOND MONTH OF WINTER 10TH DAY\nRenisenb came out onto the porch and stood there for a moment shielding her eyes against\nthe sudden glare.",
    "She felt sick and shaken and full of a nameless fear.",
    "She said to herself repeating the words\nover and over again mechanically\nI must warn Nofret...",
    "I must warn her...",
    "Behind her in the house she could hear mens voices those of Hori and Yahmose blending\ninto each other and above them shrill and clear the boyish tones of Ipy.",
    "Satipy and Kait are right.",
    "There are no men in this family But I am a man.",
    "Yes I am a\nman in heart if not in years.",
    "Nofret has jeered at me laughed at me treated me as a child.",
    "I\nwill show her that I am not a child.",
    "I am not afraid of my fathers anger.",
    "I know my father.",
    "He is bewitched  the woman has put a spell on him.",
    "If she were destroyed his heart would\ncome back to me  to me I am the son he loves best.",
    "You all treat me as a child  but you\nshall see.",
    "Yes you shall see\nRushing out of the house he collided with Renisenb and almost knocked her down.",
    "She\nclutched at his sleeve.",
    "Ipy Ipy where are you going\nTo find Nofret.",
    "She shall see whether she can laugh at me\nWait a little.",
    "You must calm down.",
    "We must none of us do anything rash.",
    "Rash The boy laughed scornfully.",
    "You are like Yahmose.",
    "Prudence Caution Nothing\nmust be done in a hurry Yahmose is an old woman.",
    "And Sobek is all words and boasting.",
    "Let go of me Renisenb.",
    "He twitched the linen of his sleeve from her grasp.",
    "Nofret where is Nofret\nHenet who had just come bustling out from the house murmured\nOh dear this is a bad business  a very bad business.",
    "What will become of us all What\nwould my dear mistress say\nWhere is Nofret Henet\nRenisenb cried Dont tell him but Henet was already answering\nShe went out the back way.",
    "Down towards the flax fields.",
    "Ipy rushed back through the house and Renisenb said reproachfully\nYou should not have told him Henet.",
    "You dont trust old Henet.",
    "You never have confidence in me.",
    "The whine in her voice\nbecame more pronounced.",
    "But poor old Henet knows what she is doing.",
    "The boy needs time to cool off.",
    "He wont find\nNofret by the flax fields.",
    "She grinned.",
    "Nofret is here  in the pavilion  with Kameni.",
    "She nodded her head across the courtyard.",
    "And she added with what seemed rather\ndisproportionate stress\nWith Kameni...",
    "But Renisenb had already started to cross the courtyard.",
    "Teti dragging her wooden lion came running from the lake to her mother and Renisenb\ncaught her up in her arms.",
    "She knew as she held the child to her the force that was driving Satipy and Kait.",
    "These\nwomen were fighting for their children.",
    "Teti gave a little fretful cry.",
    "Not so tight Mother not so tight.",
    "You are hurting me.",
    "Renisenb put the child down.",
    "She went slowly across the courtyard.",
    "On the far side of the\npavilion Nofret and Kameni were standing together.",
    "They turned as Renisenb approached.",
    "Renisenb spoke quickly and breathlessly\nNofret I have come to warn you.",
    "You must be careful.",
    "You must guard yourself.",
    "A look of contemptuous amusement passed over Nofrets face.",
    "So the dogs are howling\nThey are very angry  they will do some harm to you.",
    "Nofret shook her head.",
    "No one can harm me she said with a superb confidence.",
    "If they did it would be\nreported to your father  and he would exact vengeance.",
    "They will know that when they\npause to think.",
    "She laughed.",
    "What fools they have been  with their petty insults and\npersecutions It was my game they played all the time.",
    "Renisenb said slowly\nSo you have planned for this all along And I was sorry for you  I thought we were\nunkind I am not sorry any longer...",
    "I think Nofret that you are wicked.",
    "When you come\nto deny the fortytwo sins at the hour of judgment you will not be able to say I have done\n\n\fno evil.",
    "Nor will you be able to say I have not been covetous.",
    "And your heart that is being\nweighed in the scales against the feather of truth will sink in the balance.",
    "Nofret said sullenly\nYou are very pious all of a sudden.",
    "But I have not harmed you Renisenb.",
    "I said nothing\nagainst you.",
    "Ask Kameni if that is not so.",
    "Then she walked across the courtyard and up the steps to the porch.",
    "Henet came out to\nmeet her and the two women went into the house.",
    "Renisenb turned slowly to Kameni.",
    "So it was you Kameni who helped her to do this to us\nKameni said eagerly\nAre you very angry with me Renisenb But what could I do Before Imhotep left he\ncharged me solemnly that I was to write at Nofrets bidding at any time she might ask me\nto do so.",
    "Say you do not blame me Renisenb.",
    "What else could I do\nI cannot blame you said Renisenb slowly.",
    "You had I suppose to carry out my fathers\norders.",
    "I did not like doing it  and it is true Renisenb there was not one word said against you.",
    "As if I cared about that\nBut I do.",
    "Whatever Nofret had told me I would not have written one word that might\nharm you.",
    "Renisenb  please believe me.",
    "Renisenb shook her head perplexedly.",
    "The point Kameni was laboring to make seemed of\nlittle importance to her.",
    "She felt hurt and angry as though Kameni in some way had\nfailed her.",
    "Yet he was after all a stranger.",
    "Though allied by blood he was nevertheless a\nstranger whom her father had brought from a distant part of the country.",
    "He was a junior\nscribe who had been given a task by his employer and who had obediently carried it out.",
    "I wrote no more than truth Kameni persisted.",
    "There were no lies set down that I\nswear to you.",
    "No said Renisenb.",
    "There would be no lies.",
    "Nofret is too clever for that.",
    "Old Esa had after all been right.",
    "That persecution over which Satipy and Kait had gloated\nhad been just exactly what Nofret had wanted.",
    "No wonder she had gone about smiling her\ncatlike smile.",
    "She is bad said Renisenb following out her thoughts.",
    "Yes\nKameni assented.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "She is an evil creature.",
    "Renisenb turned and looked at him curiously.",
    "You knew her before she came here did you nor You knew her in Memphis\nKameni flushed and looked uncomfortable.",
    "I did not know her well...",
    "I had heard of her.",
    "A proud girl they said ambitious and hard and one who did not forgive.",
    "Renisenb flung back her head in sudden impatience.",
    "I do not believe it she said.",
    "My father will not do what he threatens.",
    "He is angry at\npresent  but he could not be so unjust.",
    "When he comes he will forgive.",
    "When he comes said Kameni Nofret will see to it that he does not change his mind.",
    "You do not know Nofret Renisenb.",
    "She is very clever and very determined  and she is\nremember very beautiful.",
    "Yes admitted Renisenb.",
    "She is beautiful \nShe got up.",
    "For some reason the thought of Nofrets beauty hurt her...\n\n\fII\nRenisenb spent the afternoon playing with the children.",
    "As she took part in their game the\nvague ache in her heart lessened.",
    "It was not until just before sunset that she stood upright\nsmoothing back her hair and the pleats of her dress which had got crumpled and\ndisarranged and wondered vaguely why neither Satipy nor Kait had been out as usual.",
    "Kameni had long gone from the courtyard.",
    "Renisenb went slowly across into the house.",
    "There was no one in the living room and she passed through to the back of the house and\nthe womens quarters.",
    "Esa was nodding in the corner of her room and her little slave girl\nwas marking piles of linen sheets.",
    "They were baking batches of triangular loaves in the\nkitchen.",
    "There was no one else about.",
    "A curious emptiness pressed on Renisenbs spirits.",
    "Where was everyone\nHori had probably gone up to the Tomb.",
    "Yahmose might be with him or out in the fields.",
    "Sobek and Ipy would be with the cattle or possibly seeing to the cornbins.",
    "But where were\nSatipy and Kait and where yes where was Nofret\nThe strong perfume of Nofrets unguent filled her empty room.",
    "Renisenb stood in the\ndoorway staring at the little wood pillow at a jewel box at a heap of bead bracelets and a\nring set with a blue glazed scarab.",
    "Perfumes unguents clothes linens sandals  all\nspeaking of their owner of Nofret who lived in their midst and who was a stranger and an\nenemy.",
    "Where Renisenb wondered could Nofret herself be\nShe went slowly towards the back entrance of the house and met Henet coming in.",
    "Where is everybody Henet The house is empty except for my grandmother.",
    "How should I know Renisenb I have been working  helping with the weaving seeing to\na thousand and one things.",
    "I have no time for going for walks.",
    "That meant thought Renisenb that somebody had gone for a walk.",
    "Perhaps Satipy had\nfollowed Yahmose up to the Tomb to harangue him further But where was Kait Unlike\nKait to be away from her children for so long.",
    "And again a strange disturbing undercurrent there ran the thought\nWhere is Nofret\nAs though Henet had read the thought in her mind she supplied the answer.",
    "As for Nofret she went off a long time ago up to the Tomb.",
    "Oh well Hori is a match for\nher.",
    "Henet laughed spitefully.",
    "Hori has brains too.",
    "She sidled a little closer to Renisenb.",
    "I wish you knew Renisenb how unhappy Ive been over all this.",
    "She came to me you\nknow that day  with the mark of Kaits fingers on her cheek and the blood streaming\ndown.",
    "And she got Kameni to write and me to say what Id seen  and of course I couldnt\nsay I hadnt seen it Oh shes a clever one.",
    "And I thinking all the time of your dear mother\n\nRenisenb pushed past her and went out into the golden glow of the evening sun.",
    "Deep\nshadows were on the cliffs  the whole world looked fantastic at this hour of sunset.",
    "Renisenbs steps quickened as she took the way to the cliff path.",
    "She would go up to the\nTomb  find Hori.",
    "Yes find Hori.",
    "It was what she had done as a child when her toys had\nbeen broken  when she had been uncertain or afraid.",
    "Hori was like the cliffs themselves steadfast immovable unchanging.",
    "Renisenb thought confusedly Everything will be all right when I get to Hori...",
    "Her steps quickened  she was almost running.",
    "Then suddenly she saw Satipy coming towards her.",
    "Satipy too must have been up to the\nTomb.",
    "What a very odd way Satipy was walking swaying from side to side stumbling as though\nshe could not see...",
    "When Satipy saw Renisenb she stopped short her hand went to her breast.",
    "Renisenb\ndrawing close was startled at the sight of Satipys face.",
    "Whats the matter Satipy are you ill\nSatipys voice in answer was a croak her eyes were shifting from side to side.",
    "No no of course not.",
    "You look ill. You look frightened.",
    "What has happened\nWhat should have happened Nothing of course.",
    "Where have you been\nI went up to the Tomb  to find Yahmose.",
    "He was not there.",
    "No one was there.",
    "Renisenb still stared.",
    "This was a new Satipy  a Satipy with all the spirit and resolution\ndrained out of her.",
    "Come Renisenb  come back to the house.",
    "Satipy put a slightly shaking hand on Renisenbs arm urging her back the way she had\ncome and at that touch Renisenb felt a sudden revolt.",
    "No I am going up to the Tomb.",
    "There is no one there I tell you.",
    "I like to look out over the River.",
    "To sit there.",
    "But the sun is setting  it is too late.",
    "Satipys fingers closed viselike over Renisenbs arm.",
    "Renisenb wrenched herself loose.",
    "Dont Let me go Satipy.",
    "No.",
    "Come back.",
    "Come back with me.",
    "But Renisenb had already broken loose pushed past her and was on her way to the cliff.",
    "There was something  instinct told her there was something...",
    "Her steps quickened to a\nrun...\nThen she saw it  the dark bundle lying under the shadow of the cliff... She hurried along\nuntil she stood close beside it.",
    "There was no surprise in her at what she saw.",
    "It was as though already she had expected\nit...\nNofret lay with her face upturned her body broken and twisted.",
    "Her eyes were open and\nsightless...\nRenisenb bent and touched the cold stiff cheek then stood up again looking down on her.",
    "She hardly heard Satipy come up behind her.",
    "She must have fallen Satipy was saying.",
    "She has fallen.",
    "She was walking along the cliff\npath and she fell...",
    "Yes Renisenb thought that was what had happened.",
    "Nofret had fallen from the path\nabove her body bouncing off the limestone rocks.",
    "She may have seen a snake said Satipy and been startled.",
    "There are snakes asleep in\nthe sun on that path sometimes.",
    "Snakes.",
    "Yes snakes.",
    "Sobek and the snake.",
    "A snake its back broken lying dead in the sun.",
    "Sobek his eyes gleaming...\nShe thought Sobek... Nofret...\n\n\fThen sudden relief came to her as she heard Horis voice.",
    "What has happened\nShe turned with relief.",
    "Hori and Yahmose had come up together.",
    "Satipy was explaining\neagerly that Nofret must have fallen from the path above.",
    "Yahmose said She must have come up to find us but Hori and I have been out to look at\nthe irrigation canals.",
    "We have been away at least an hour.",
    "As we came back we saw you\nstanding here.",
    "Renisenb said and her voice surprised her it sounded so different Where is Sobek\nShe felt rather than saw Horis immediate sharp turn of the head at the question.",
    "Yahmose\nsounded merely puzzled as he said\nSobek I have not seen him all the afternoon.",
    "Not since he left us so angrily in the house.",
    "But Hori was looking at Renisenb.",
    "She raised her eyes and met his.",
    "She saw him turn from\ntheir gaze and look down thoughtfully at Nofrets body and she knew with absolute\ncertainty exactly what he was thinking.",
    "He murmured questioningly\nSobek\nOh no Renisenb heard herself saying.",
    "Oh no... Oh no...\nSatipy said again urgently She fell from the path.",
    "It is narrow just above here  and\ndangerous...",
    "Dangerous What was it Hori had told her once A tale of Sobek as a child attacking\nYahmose and of her dead mother prising them apart and saying You must not do that\nSobek.",
    "It is dangerous...\nSobek liked killing.",
    "What I do I shall enjoy doing.",
    "Sobek killing a snake...\nSobek meeting Nofret on that narrow path...\nShe heard herself murmuring brokenly\nWe dont know  we dont know...\nAnd then with infinite relief with the sense of a burden taken away she heard Horis\ngrave voice giving weight and value to Satipys asseveration.",
    "She must have fallen from the path...\nHis eyes met Renisenbs.",
    "She thought He and I know... We shall always know...\nAloud she heard her voice saying shakily\nShe fell from the path...\nAnd like a final echo Yahmoses gentle voice chimed in\nShe must have fallen from the path.",
    "Chapter 10\nFOURTH MONTH OF WINTER 6TH DAY\nImhotep sat facing Esa.",
    "They all tell the same story he said fretfully.",
    "That is at least convenient said Esa.",
    "Convenient  convenient What extraordinary words you use\nEsa gave a short cackle.",
    "I know what I am saying my son.",
    "Are they speaking the truth that is what I have to decide Imhotep spoke portentously.",
    "You are hardly the goddess Maat.",
    "Nor like Anubis can you weigh the heart in a\nbalance\nWas it an accident Imhotep shook his head judicially.",
    "I have to remember that the\nannouncement of my intentions towards my ungrateful family may have aroused some\npassionate feelings.",
    "Yes indeed said Esa.",
    "Feelings were aroused.",
    "They shouted so in the main hall that I\ncould hear what was said in my room here.",
    "By the way were those really your intentions\nImhotep shifted uneasily as he murmured\nI wrote in anger  in justifiable anger.",
    "My family needed teaching a sharp lesson.",
    "In other words said Esa you were merely giving them a fright.",
    "Is that it\nMy dear mother does that matter now\nI see said Esa.",
    "You did not know what you meant to do.",
    "Muddled thinking as usual.",
    "Imhotep controlled his irritation with an effort.",
    "I simply mean that that particular point no longer arises.",
    "It is the facts of Nofrets death\nthat are now in question.",
    "If I were to believe that anyone in my family could be so\nundutiful so unbalanced in their anger as wantonly to harm the girl  I  I really do not\nknow what I should do\nSo it is fortunate said Esa that they all tell the same story Nobody has hinted at\nanything else have they\nCertainly not.",
    "Then why not regard the incident as closed You should have taken the girl north with\nyou.",
    "I told you so at the time.",
    "Then you do believe \nEsa said with emphasis\nI believe what I am told unless it conflicts with what I have seen with my own eyes  which\nis very little nowadays  or heard with my own ears.",
    "You have questioned Henet I\nsuppose What has she to say of the matter\nShe is deeply distressed  very deeply distressed.",
    "On my behalf.",
    "Esa raised her eyebrows.",
    "Indeed.",
    "You surprise me.",
    "Henet said Imhotep warmly has a lot of heart.",
    "Quite so.",
    "She has also more than the usual allowance of tongue.",
    "If distress at your loss is\nher only reaction.",
    "I should certainly regard the incident as closed.",
    "There are plenty of other\naffairs to occupy your attention.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Imhotep rose with a reassumption of his fussy important manner.",
    "Yahmose is waiting for me now in the main hall with all sorts of matters needing my\nurgent attention.",
    "There are many decisions awaiting my sanction.",
    "As you say private grief\nmust not usurp the main functions of life.",
    "He hurried out.",
    "Esa smiled for a moment a somewhat sardonic smile then her face grew grave again.",
    "She\nsighed and shook her head.",
    "II\nYahmose was awaiting his father with Kameni in attendance.",
    "Hori Yahmose explained\nwas superintending the work of the embalmers and undertakers who were busy with the\n\n\ffirst stages of the funeral preparations.",
    "It had taken Imhotep some weeks to journey home after receiving the news of Nofrets\ndeath and the funeral preparations were now completed.",
    "The body had received its long\nsoaking in the brine bath had been restored to some semblance of its normal appearance\nhad been oiled and rubbed with salts and duly wrapped in its bandages and deposited in\nits coffin.",
    "Yahmose explained that he had appointed a small funeral chamber near the rock tomb\ndesigned later to hold the body of Imhotep himself.",
    "He went into the details of what he had\nordered and Imhotep expressed his approval.",
    "You have done well Yahmose he said kindly.",
    "You seem to have shown very good\njudgment and to have kept your head well.",
    "Yahmose colored a little at this unexpected praise.",
    "Ipi and Montu are of course expensive embalmers went on Imhotep.",
    "These canopic\njars for instance seem to me unduly costly.",
    "There is really no need for such extravagance.",
    "Some of their charges seem to me much too high.",
    "That is the worst of these embalmers who\nhave been employed by the Governors family.",
    "They think they can charge any fantastic\nprices they like.",
    "It would have come much cheaper to go to somebody less wellknown.",
    "In your absence said Yahmose I had to decide on these matters  and I was anxious\nthat all honor should be paid to a concubine for whom you had so great a regard.",
    "Imhotep nodded and patted Yahmoses shoulder.",
    "It was a fault on the right side my son.",
    "You are I know usually most prudent in money\nmatters.",
    "I appreciate that in this matter any unnecessary expense was incurred in order  to\nplease me.",
    "All the same I am not made of money and a concubine is  er ahem  only a\nconcubine.",
    "We will cancel I think the more expensive of the amulets  and let me see there\nare one or two other ways of cutting down the fees... Just read out the items of the estimate\nKameni.",
    "Kameni rustled the papyrus.",
    "Yahmose breathed a sigh of relief.",
    "III\nKait coming slowly out from the house to the lake paused where the children and their\nmothers were.",
    "You were right Satipy she said.",
    "A live concubine is not the same as a dead concubine\nSatipy looked up at her her eyes vague and unseeing.",
    "It was Renisenb who asked quickly\nWhat do you mean Kait\nFor a live concubine nothing was too good  clothes jewels  even the inheritance of\nImhoteps own flesh and blood But now Imhotep is busy cutting down the cost of the\nfuneral expenses After all why waste money on a dead woman Yes Satipy you were\nright.",
    "Satipy murmured What did I say I have forgotten.",
    "It is best so agreed Kait.",
    "I too have forgotten.",
    "And Renisenb also.",
    "Renisenb looked at Kait without speaking.",
    "There had been something in Kaits voice something faintly menacing that impressed Renisenb disagreeably.",
    "She had always been\naccustomed to think of Kait as rather a stupid woman  someone gentle and submissive but\nrather negligible.",
    "It struck her now that Kait and Satipy seemed to have changed places.",
    "Satipy the dominant and aggressive was subdued  almost timid.",
    "It was the quiet Kait who\nnow seemed to domineer over Satipy.",
    "But people thought Renisenb do not really change\ntheir characters  or do they She felt confused.",
    "Had Kait and Satipy really changed in the\nlast few weeks or was the change in the one the result of the change in the other Was it\nKait who had grown aggressive Or did she merely seem so because of the sudden collapse\nof Satipy\nSatipy definitely was different.",
    "Her voice was no longer upraised in the familiar shrewish\naccents.",
    "She crept round the courtyard and the house with a nervous shrinking gait quite\nunlike her usual selfassured manner.",
    "Renisenb had put down the change in her to the\nshock of Nofrets death but it was incredible that that shock could last so long.",
    "It would\nhave been far more like Satipy Renisenb could not but think to have exulted openly in a\nmatteroffact manner over the concubines sudden and untimely death.",
    "As it was she\nshrank nervously whenever Nofrets name was mentioned.",
    "Even Yahmose seemed to be\nexempt from her hectoring and bullying and had in consequence begun to assume a more\nresolute demeanor himself.",
    "At any rate the change in Satipy was all to the good  or at least\nso Renisenb supposed.",
    "Yet something about it made her vaguely uneasy...",
    "Suddenly with a start Renisenb became aware that Kait was looking at her was frowning.",
    "Kait she realized was waiting for a word of assent to something she had just said.",
    "Renisenb also repeated Kait has forgotten.",
    "Suddenly Renisenb felt a flood of revolt overwhelm her.",
    "Neither Kait nor Satipy nor\nanyone should dictate to her what she should or should not remember.",
    "She returned Kaits\nlook steadily with a distinct hint of defiance.",
    "The women of a household said Kait must stand together.",
    "Renisenb found her voice.",
    "She said clearly and defiantly\nWhy\nBecause their interests are the same.",
    "Renisenb shook her head violently.",
    "She thought confusedly I am a person as well as a\nwoman.",
    "I am Renisenb.",
    "Aloud she said\nIt is not so simple as that.",
    "Do you want to make trouble Renisenb\nNo.",
    "And anyway what do you mean by trouble\nEverything that was said that day in the big hall had best be forgotten.",
    "Renisenb laughed.",
    "You are stupid Kait.",
    "The servants the slaves my grandmother  everyone must have\noverheard Why pretend that things did not happen that did happen\nWe were angry said Satipy in a dull voice.",
    "We did not mean what we said.",
    "She added with a feverish irritability\nStop talking about it Kait.",
    "If Renisenb wants to make trouble let her.",
    "I dont want to make trouble said Renisenb indignantly.",
    "But it is stupid to pretend.",
    "No said Kait.",
    "It is wisdom.",
    "You have Teti to consider.",
    "Teti is all right.",
    "Everything is all right  now that Nofret is dead.",
    "Kait smiled.",
    "It was a serene quiet satisfied smile  and again Renisenb felt a tide of revolt rise in her.",
    "Yet what Kait said was quite true.",
    "Now that Nofret was dead everything was all right.",
    "Satipy Kait herself the children  all secure  all at peace  with no apprehensions for the\n\n\ffuture.",
    "The intruder the disturbing menacing stranger had departed  for ever.",
    "Then why this stirring of an emotion that she did not understand on Nofrets behalf Why\nthis feeling of championship for the dead girl whom she had not liked Nofret was wicked\nand Nofret was dead.",
    "Could she not leave it at that Why this sudden stab of pity  of\nsomething more than pity  something that was almost comprehension\nRenisenb shook her head perplexedly.",
    "She sat on there by the water after the others had\ngone in trying vainly to understand the confusion in her mind.",
    "The sun was low when Hori crossing the courtyard saw her and came to sit beside her.",
    "It is late Renisenb.",
    "The sun is setting.",
    "You should go in His grave quiet voice soothed\nher as always.",
    "She turned to him with a question.",
    "Must the women of a household stick together\nWho has been saying that to you Renisenb\nKait.",
    "She and Satipy \nRenisenb broke off.",
    "And you  want to think for yourself\nOh think I do not know how to think Hori.",
    "Everything is confused in my head.",
    "People\nare confused.",
    "Everybody is different from what I thought they were.",
    "Satipy I always\nthought was bold resolute domineering.",
    "But now she is weak vacillating even timid.",
    "Then\nwhich is the real Satipy People cannot change like that in a day.",
    "Not in a day  no.",
    "And Kait  she who was always meek and submissive and let everybody bully her.",
    "Now\nshe dominates us all Even Sobek seems afraid of her.",
    "And even Yahmose is different  he\ngives orders and expects them to be obeyed\nAnd all this confuses you Renisenb\nYes.",
    "Because I do not understand.",
    "I feel sometimes that even Henet may be quite different\nfrom what she appears to be\nRenisenb laughed as though at an absurdity but Hori did nor join her.",
    "His face remained\ngrave and thoughtful.",
    "You have never thought very much about people have you Renisenb If you had you\nwould realize  He paused and then went on.",
    "You know that in all tombs there is always\na false door\nRenisenb stared.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "Well people are like that too.",
    "They create a false door  to deceive.",
    "If they are conscious of\nweakness of inefficiency they make an imposing door of selfassertion of bluster of\noverwhelming authority  and after a time they get to believe in it themselves.",
    "They think\nand everybody thinks that they are like that.",
    "But behind that door Renisenb is bare\nrock... And so when reality comes and touches them with the feather of truth  their true\nself reasserts itself.",
    "For Kait gentleness and submission brought her all she desired  a\nhusband and children.",
    "Stupidity made life easier for her.",
    "But when reality in the form of\ndanger threatened her true nature appeared.",
    "She did not change Renisenb  that strength\nand that ruthlessness were always there.",
    "Renisenb said childishly But I do not like it Hori.",
    "It makes me afraid.",
    "Everyone being\ndifferent from what I thought them.",
    "And what about myself I am always the same.",
    "Are you He smiled at her.",
    "Then why have you sat here all these hours your forehead\npuckered brooding and thinking Did the old Renisenb  the Renisenb who went away\nwith Khay  ever do that\n\n\fOh no.",
    "There was no need  Renisenb stopped.",
    "You see You have said it yourself.",
    "That is the word of reality  need You are not the\nhappy unthinking child you have always appeared to be accepting everything at its face\nvalue.",
    "You are not just one of the women of the household.",
    "You are Renisenb who wants to\nthink for herself who wonders about other people...\nRenisenb said slowly I have been wondering about Nofret...\nWhat have you been wondering\nI have been wondering why I cannot forget about her... She was bad and cruel and tried\nto do us harm and she is dead.",
    "Why can I not leave it at that\nCan you not leave it at that\nNo.",
    "I try to  but  Renisenb paused.",
    "She passed her hand across her eyes perplexedly.",
    "Sometimes I feel I know about Nofret Hori.",
    "Know What do you mean\nI cant explain.",
    "But it comes to me every now and then  almost as though she were here\nbeside me.",
    "I feel  almost  as though I were her.",
    "I seem to know what she felt.",
    "She was very\nunhappy Hori I know that now though I didnt at the time.",
    "She wanted to hurt us all\nbecause she was so unhappy.",
    "You cannot know that Renisenb.",
    "No of course I cannot know it but it is what I feel.",
    "That misery that bitterness that black\nhate  I saw it in her face once and I did not understand She must have loved someone and\nthen something went wrong  perhaps he died... or went away  but it left her like that wanting to hurt  to wound.",
    "Oh You may say what you like.",
    "I know I am right She\nbecame a concubine to that old man my father  and she came here and we disliked her and she thought she would make us all as unhappy as she was  Yes that was how it was\nHori looked at her curiously.",
    "How sure you sound Renisenb.",
    "And yet you did not know Nofret well.",
    "But I feel it is true Hori.",
    "I feel her  Nofret.",
    "Sometimes I feel her quite close beside me...",
    "I see.",
    "There was silence between them.",
    "It was almost dark now.",
    "Then Hori said quietly You believe do you not that Nofret did not die by accident You\nthink she was thrown down\nRenisenb felt a passionate repugnance at hearing her belief put into words.",
    "No no dont say it.",
    "But I think Renisenb we had better say it  since it is in your head.",
    "You do think so\nI  yes\nHori bent his head thoughtfully.",
    "He went on\nAnd you think it was Sobek who did it\nWho else could it have been You remember him with the snake And you remember\nwhat he said  that day  the day of her death  before he went out of the great hall\nI remember what he said yes.",
    "But it is not always the people who say most who do most\nBut dont you believe she was killed\nYes Renisenb I do...",
    "But it is after all only an opinion.",
    "I have no proof.",
    "I do not think\nthere ever can be proof.",
    "That is why I have encouraged Imhotep to accept the verdict of\naccident.",
    "Someone pushed Nofret  we shall never know who it was.",
    "You mean you dont think it was Sobek\nI do not think so.",
    "But as I say we can never know  so it is best not to think about it.",
    "But  if it was not Sobek  who do you think it was\nHori shook his head.",
    "If I have an idea  it may be the wrong idea.",
    "So it is better not to say...",
    "But then  we shall never know\nThere was dismay in Renisenbs voice.",
    "Perhaps  Hori hesitated  perhaps that may be the best thing.",
    "Not to know\nNot to know.",
    "Renisenb shivered.",
    "But then  oh Hori I am afraid\nChapter 11\nFIRST MONTH OF SUMMER 11TH DAY\nThe final ceremonies had been completed and the incantations duly spoken.",
    "Montu a\nDivine Father of the Temple of Hathor took the broom of heden grass and carefully swept\nout the chamber whilst he recited the charm to remove the footprints of all evil spirits\nbefore the door was sealed up for ever.",
    "Then the Tomb was sealed and all that remained of the embalmers workpots full of\nnatron salt and rags that had been in contact with the body were placed in a little chamber\nnear by and that too was sealed.",
    "Imhotep squared his shoulders and took a deep breath relaxing his devout funeral\nexpression.",
    "Everything had been done in a befitting manner.",
    "Nofret had been buried with\nall the prescribed rites and with no sparing of expense somewhat undue expense in\nImhoteps opinion.",
    "Imhotep exchanged courtesies with the priests who their sacred office now finished\nreassumed their menoftheworld manner.",
    "Everyone descended to the house where\nsuitable refreshments were waiting.",
    "Imhotep discussed with the principal Divine Father the\nrecent political changes.",
    "Thebes was rapidly becoming a very powerful city.",
    "It was possible\nthat Egypt might once more be united under one ruler before very long.",
    "The Golden Age of\nthe Pyramid builders might return.",
    "Montu spoke with reverence and approval of the King NebhepetRe.",
    "A firstclass soldier\nand a man of piety also.",
    "The corrupt and cowardly north could hardly stand against him.",
    "A\nunified Egypt  that was what was needed.",
    "And it would mean undoubtedly great things\nfor Thebes...",
    "The men walked together discussing the future.",
    "Renisenb looked back at the cliff and the sealed tomb chamber.",
    "So that is the end she murmured.",
    "A feeling of relief swept over her.",
    "She had feared she\nhardly knew what Some lastminute outburst or accusation But everything had gone with\ncommendable smoothness.",
    "Nofret was duly buried with all the rites of religion.",
    "It was the end.",
    "Henet said below her breath I hope so Im sure I hope so Renisenb.",
    "Renisenb turned on her.",
    "What do you mean Henet\nHenet avoided her eyes.",
    "I just said I hoped it was the end.",
    "Sometimes what you think is an end is only a beginning.",
    "And that wouldnt do at all.",
    "Renisenb said angrily\nWhat are you talking about Henet What are you hinting at\nIm sure I never hint Renisenb.",
    "I wouldnt do such a thing.",
    "Nofrets buried and everyone\nis satisfied.",
    "So everything is as it should be.",
    "Renisenb demanded Did my father ask you what you thought about Nofrets death\nYes indeed Renisenb.",
    "Most particular he was that I should tell him exactly what I\nthought about it all.",
    "And what did you tell him\nWell of course I said it was an accident.",
    "What else could it have been You dont think\nfor a minute I said that anyone in your family would harm the girl do you They\nwouldnt dare I said.",
    "They have far too much respect for you.",
    "Grumble they might but\nnothing more I said.",
    "You can take it from me I said that theres been nothing of that\nkind\nHenet nodded her head and chuckled.",
    "And my father believed you\nAgain Henet nodded with a good deal of satisfaction.",
    "Ah your father knows how devoted I am to his interests.",
    "Hell always take old Henets\nword for anything.",
    "He appreciates me if none of the rest of you do.",
    "Ah well my devotion to\nall of you is its own reward.",
    "I dont expect thanks.",
    "You were devoted to Nofret too said Renisenb.",
    "Im sure I dont know what gave you that idea Renisenb.",
    "I had to obey orders like\neveryone else.",
    "She thought you were devoted to her.",
    "Henet chuckled again.",
    "Nofret wasnt quite as clever as she thought herself.",
    "A proud girl  and a girl who thought\nshe owned the earth.",
    "Well shes got the judges in the Underworld to satisfy now  and a\npretty face wont help her there.",
    "At any rate were quit of her.",
    "At least she added under\nher breath and touching one of the amulets she wore I hope so.",
    "II\nRenisenb I want to talk to you about Satipy.",
    "Yes Yahmose\nRenisenb looked up sympathetically into her brothers gentle worried face.",
    "Yahmose said slowly and heavily There is something very wrong the matter with Satipy.",
    "I cannot understand it.",
    "Renisenb shook her head sadly.",
    "She was at a loss to find anything comforting to say.",
    "I have noticed this change in her for some time went on Yahmose.",
    "She stares and\ntrembles at any unaccustomed noise.",
    "She does not eat well.",
    "She creeps about as though  as\nthough she were afraid of her own shadow.",
    "You must have noticed it Renisenb\nYes indeed we have all noticed it.",
    "I have asked her if she is ill  if I should send for a physician  but she says there is nothing\n that she is perfectly well.",
    "I know.",
    "So you have asked her that too And she has said nothing to you  nothing at all\n\n\fHe laid stress on the words.",
    "Renisenb sympathized with his anxiety but she could say\nnothing to help.",
    "She insists that she is quite well.",
    "Yahmose murmured She does not sleep well at night  she cries out in her sleep.",
    "Is she could she have some sorrow that we know nothing about\nRenisenb shook her head.",
    "I do not see how that is possible.",
    "There is nothing wrong with the children.",
    "Nothing has\nhappened here  except of course Nofrets death  and Satipy would hardly grieve for\nthat she added drily.",
    "Yahmose smiled faintly.",
    "No indeed.",
    "Quite the contrary.",
    "Besides this has been coming on for some time.",
    "It began I\nthink before Nofrets death.",
    "His tone was a little uncertain and Renisenb looked at him quickly.",
    "Yahmose said with\nmild persistence\nBefore Nofrets death.",
    "Dont you think so\nI did not notice it until afterwards said Renisenb slowly.",
    "And she has said nothing to you  you are sure\nRenisenb shook her head.",
    "But you know Yahmose I do not think Satipy is ill.",
    "It seems to\nme more that she is  afraid.",
    "Afraid exclaimed Yahmose in great astonishment.",
    "But why should Satipy be afraid\nAnd of what Satipy has always had the courage of a lion.",
    "I know said Renisenb helplessly.",
    "We have always thought  but people change  it is\nqueer.",
    "Does Kait know anything do you think Has Satipy spoken to her\nShe would be more likely to talk to her than to me  but I do not think so.",
    "In fact I am\nsure of it.",
    "What does Kait think\nKait Kait never thinks about anything.",
    "All Kait had done Renisenb was reflecting was to take advantage of Satipys unusual\nmeekness by grabbing for herself and her children the finest of the newly woven linen  a\nthing she would never have been allowed to do had Satipy been her usual self.",
    "The house\nwould have resounded with passionate disputings The fact that Satipy had given it up with\nhardly a murmur had impressed Renisenb more than anything else that could have\nhappened.",
    "Have you spoken to Esa Renisenb asked.",
    "Our grandmother is wise about women and\ntheir ways.",
    "Esa said Yahmose with some slight annoyance merely bids me be thankful for the\nchange.",
    "She says it is too much to hope that Satipy will continue to be so sweetly\nreasonable.",
    "Renisenb said with some slight hesitation\nHave you asked Henet\nHenet Yahmose frowned.",
    "No indeed.",
    "I would not speak of such things to Henet.",
    "She\ntakes far too much upon herself as it is.",
    "My father spoils her.",
    "Oh I know that.",
    "She is very tiresome.",
    "But all the same  well  Renisenb hesitated Henet usually knows things.",
    "Yahmose said slowly\n\n\fWould you ask her Renisenb And tell me what she says\nIf you like.",
    "Renisenb put her query at a moment when she had Henet to herself.",
    "They were on their\nway to the weaving sheds.",
    "Rather to her surprise the question seemed to make Henet\nuneasy.",
    "There was none of her usual avidity to gossip.",
    "She touched an amulet she was wearing and glanced over her shoulder.",
    "Its nothing to do with me Im sure... Its not for me to notice whether anyones\nthemselves or not.",
    "I mind my own business.",
    "If theres trouble I dont want to be mixed up\nin it.",
    "Trouble What kind of trouble\nHenet gave her a quick sideways glance.",
    "None I hope.",
    "None that need concern us anyway.",
    "You and I Renisenb weve nothing to\nreproach ourselves with.",
    "Thats a great consolation to me.",
    "Do you mean that Satipy  What do you mean\nI dont mean anything at all Renisenb  and please dont start making out that I do.",
    "Im\nlittle better than a servant in this house and its not my business to give my opinion about\nthings that are nothing to do with me.",
    "If you ask me its a change for the better and if it\nstops at that well well all do nicely.",
    "Now please Renisenb Ive got to see that they are\nmarking the date properly on the linen.",
    "So careless as they are these women always\ntalking and laughing and neglecting their work.",
    "Unsatisfied Renisenb watched her dart away into the weaving shed.",
    "She herself walked\nslowly back to the house.",
    "Her entry into Satipys room was unheard and Satipy sprang\nround with a cry as Renisenb touched her shoulder.",
    "Oh you startled me.",
    "I thought \nSatipy said Renisenb.",
    "What is the matter Wont you tell me Yahmose is worried\nabout you and \nSatipys fingers flew to her lips.",
    "She said stammering nervously her eyes wide and\nfrightened\nYahmose What  what did he say\nHe is anxious.",
    "You have been calling out in your sleep \nRenisenb Satipy caught her by the arm.",
    "Did I say  What did I say\nHer eyes seemed dilated with terror.",
    "Does Yahmose think  What did he tell you\nWe both think that you are ill  or  or unhappy.",
    "Unhappy Satipy repeated the word under her breath with a peculiar intonation.",
    "Are you unhappy Satipy\nPerhaps...",
    "I dont know.",
    "It is not that.",
    "No.",
    "Youre frightened arent you\nSatipy stared at her with sudden hostility.",
    "Why should you say that Why should I be frightened What is there to frighten me\nI dont know said Renisenb.",
    "But it is true isnt it\nWith an effort Satipy recovered her old arrogant pose.",
    "She tossed her head.",
    "Im not afraid of anything  of anyone How dare you suggest such a thing to me\nRenisenb And I wont have you talking me over with Yahmose.",
    "Yahmose and I\nunderstand each other.",
    "She paused and then said sharply Nofret is dead  and a good\nriddance.",
    "Thats what I say.",
    "And you can tell anyone who asks you that thats what I feel\n\n\fabout it.",
    "Nofret Renisenb uttered the name questioningly.",
    "Satipy flew into a passion that made her seem quite like her old self.",
    "Nofret  Nofret  Nofret Im sick of the sound of that name.",
    "We dont need to hear it any\nmore in this house  and thank goodness for that.",
    "Her voice which had been raised to its old shrill pitch dropped suddenly as Yahmose\nentered.",
    "He said with unusual sternness\nBe quiet Satipy.",
    "If my father heard you there would be fresh trouble.",
    "How can you\nbehave so foolishly\nIf Yahmoses stern and displeased tone was unusual so too was Satipys meek collapse.",
    "She\nmurmured I am sorry Yahmose...",
    "I did not think.",
    "Well be more careful in future You and Kait made most of the trouble before.",
    "You\nwomen have no sense\nSatipy murmured again I am sorry...\nYahmose went out his shoulders squared and his walk far more resolute than usual as\nthough the fact of having asserted his authority for once had done him good.",
    "Renisenb went slowly along to old Esas room.",
    "Her grandmother she felt might have some\nhelpful counsel.",
    "Esa however who was eating grapes with a good deal of relish refused to take the matter\nseriously.",
    "Satipy Satipy Why all this fuss about Satipy Do you all like being bullied and ordered\nabout by her that you make such a todo because she behaves herself properly for once\nShe spat out the pips of the grape and remarked\nIn any case its too good to last  unless Yahmose can keep it up.",
    "Yahmose\nYes.",
    "I hoped Yahmose had come to his senses at last and given Satipy a good beating.",
    "Its\nwhat she needs  and shes the kind of woman who would probably enjoy it.",
    "Yahmose with\nhis meek cringing ways must have been a great trial to her.",
    "Yahmose is a dear cried Renisenb indignantly.",
    "He is kind to everybody  and as gentle\nas a woman  if women are gentle she added doubtfully.",
    "Esa cackled.",
    "A good afterthought Granddaughter.",
    "No theres nothing gentle about women  or if there\nis Isis help them And there are few women who care for a kind gentle husband.",
    "Theyd\nsooner have a handsome blustering brute like Sobek  hes the one to take a girls fancy.",
    "Or\na smart young fellow like Kameni  hey Renisenb The flies in the courtyard dont settle on\nhim for long Hes got a pretty taste in love songs too.",
    "Eh Hee hee hee.",
    "Renisenb felt her cheeks going red.",
    "I dont know what you mean she said with dignity.",
    "You all think old Esa doesnt know whats going on I know all right.",
    "She peered at\nRenisenb with her semiblind eyes.",
    "I know perhaps before you do child.",
    "Dont be angry.",
    "Its the way of life Renisenb.",
    "Khay was a good brother to you  but he sails his boat now in\nthe Field of Offerings.",
    "The sister will find a new brother who spears his fish in our own\nRiver  not that Kameni would be much good.",
    "A reed pen and a papyrus roll are his fancy.",
    "A personable young man though  with a pretty taste in songs.",
    "But for all that Im not sure\nhes the man for you.",
    "We dont know much about him  hes a northerner.",
    "Imhotep\napproves of him  but then Ive always thought Imhotep was a fool.",
    "Anyone can get round\n\n\fhim by flattery.",
    "Look at Henet\nYou are quite wrong said Renisenb with dignity.",
    "Very well then Im wrong.",
    "Your father is not a fool.",
    "I didnt mean that.",
    "I meant \nI know what you meant child.",
    "Esa grinned.",
    "But you dont know the real joke.",
    "You\ndont know how good it is to sit at ease like I do and to be done with all this business of\nbrothers and sisters and loving and hating.",
    "To eat a wellcooked fat quail or a reed bird\nand then a cake with honey and some wellcooked leeks and celery and wash it down with\nwine from Syria  and have never a care in the world.",
    "And look on at all the turmoil and\nthe heartaches and know that none of that can affect you any more.",
    "To see your son make a\nfool of himself over a handsome girl and to see her set the whole place by the ears  it made\nme laugh I can tell you In a way you know I liked that girl She had the devil in her all\nright  the way she touched them all on the raw.",
    "Sobek like a pricked bladder  Ipy made to\nlook a child  Yahmose shamed as a bullied husband.",
    "Its like the way you see your face in a\npool of water.",
    "She made them see just how they looked to the world at large.",
    "But why did\nshe hate you Renisenb Answer me that.",
    "Did she hate me Renisenb spoke doubtfully.",
    "I  tried once to be friends.",
    "And shed have none of it She hated you all right Renisenb.",
    "Esa paused and then asked sharply\nWould it be because of Kameni\nThe color rose in Renisenbs face.",
    "Kameni I do not know what you mean.",
    "Esa said thoughtfully\nShe and Kameni both came from the north but it was you Kameni watched cross the\ncourtyard.",
    "Renisenb said abruptly\nI must go and see to Teti.",
    "Esas shrill amused cackle followed her.",
    "Her cheeks hot Renisenb sped across the\ncourtyard towards the lake.",
    "Kameni called to her from the porch\nI have made a new song Renisenb.",
    "Stay and hear it.",
    "She shook her head and hurried on.",
    "Her heart was beating angrily.",
    "Kameni and Nofret.",
    "Nofret and Kameni.",
    "Why let old Esa with her malicious love of mischief put these ideas\ninto her head And why should she care\nAnyway what did it matter She cared nothing for Kameni  nothing at all.",
    "An impertinent\nyoung man with a laughing voice and shoulders that reminded her of Khay.",
    "Khay... Khay...\nShe repeated his name insistently  but for once no image came before her eyes.",
    "Khay was\nin another world.",
    "He was in the Field of Offerings...\nOn the porch Kameni was singing softly\nI will say to Ptah Give me my sister tonight...\nIII\nRenisenb\nHori had repeated her name twice before she heard him and turned from her\ncontemplation of the Nile.",
    "You were lost in thought Renisenb.",
    "What were you thinking about\nRenisenb said with defiance\nI was thinking of Khay.",
    "Hori looked at her for a minute or two  then he smiled.",
    "I see he said.",
    "Renisenb had an uncomfortable feeling that he did see\nShe said with a sudden rush\nWhat happens when you are dead Does anyone really know All these texts  all these\nthings that are written on coffins  some of them are so obscure they seem to mean nothing\nat all.",
    "We know that Osiris was killed and that his body was joined together again and that\nhe wears the white crown and because of him we need not die  but sometimes Hori none\nof it seems real  and it is all so confused...\nHori nodded gently.",
    "But what really happens after you are dead  that is what I want to know\nI cannot tell you Renisenb.",
    "You should ask a priest these questions.",
    "He would just give me the usual answers.",
    "I want to know.",
    "Hori said gently\nWe shall none of us know until we are dead ourselves...\nRenisenb shivered.",
    "Dont  dont say that\nSomething has upset you Renisenb\nIt was Esa.",
    "She paused and then said Tell me Hori did  did Kameni and Nofret know\neach other well before  before they came here\nHori stood quite still for a moment then as he walked by Renisenbs side back towards the\nhouse he said I see.",
    "So that is how it is...\nWhat do you mean  that is how it is I only asked you a question.",
    "To which I do not know the answer.",
    "Nofret and Kameni knew each other in the north how well I do not know.",
    "He added gently Does it matter\nNo of course not said Renisenb.",
    "It is of no importance at all.",
    "Nofret is dead.",
    "Dead and embalmed and sealed up in her tomb And that is that\nHori continued calmly\nAnd Kameni  does not seem to grieve...\nNo said Renisenb struck by this aspect of the question.",
    "That is true.",
    "She turned to\nhim impulsively.",
    "Oh Hori how  how comforting a person you are\nHe smiled.",
    "I mended little Renisenbs lion for her.",
    "Now  she has other toys.",
    "Renisenb skirted the house as they came to it.",
    "I dont want to go in yet.",
    "I feel I hate them all.",
    "Oh not really you understand.",
    "But just\nbecause I am cross  and impatient and everyone is so odd.",
    "Can we not go up to your\nTomb It is so nice up there  one is  oh above everything.",
    "That is clever of you Renisenb.",
    "That is what I feel.",
    "The house and the cultivation and the\nfarming lands  all that is below one insignificant.",
    "One looks beyond all that  to the River and beyond again  to the whole of Egypt.",
    "For very soon now Egypt will be one again strong and great as she was in the past.",
    "Renisenb murmured vaguely\nOh  does it matter\nHori smiled.",
    "Not to little Renisenb.",
    "Only her own lion matters to Renisenb.",
    "You are laughing at me Hori.",
    "So it does matter to you\nHori murmured\nWhy should it Yes why should it I am only a kapriests man of business.",
    "Why should I\ncare if Egypt is great or small\nLook.",
    "Renisenb drew his attention to the cliff above them.",
    "Yahmose and Satipy have\nbeen up to the Tomb.",
    "They are coming down now.",
    "Yes said Hori.",
    "There were some things to be cleared away some rolls of linen that the\nembalmers did not use.",
    "Yahmose said he would get Satipy to come up and advise him what\nto do about them.",
    "The two of them stood there looking up at the two descending the path above.",
    "It came to Renisenb suddenly that they were just approaching the spot from which Nofret\nmust have fallen.",
    "Satipy was ahead Yahmose a little way behind her.",
    "Suddenly Satipy turned her head to speak to Yahmose.",
    "Perhaps Renisenb thought she was\nsaying to him that this must be the place where the accident had occurred.",
    "And then suddenly Satipy stiffened in her tracks.",
    "She stood as though frozen staring back\nalong the path.",
    "Her arms went up as though at some dreadful sight or as though to ward\noff a blow.",
    "She cried out something stumbled swayed and then as Yahmose sprang\ntowards her she screamed a scream of terror and plunged forward off the edge headlong\nto the rocks below...\nRenisenb her hand to her throat watched the fall unbelievingly.",
    "Satipy lay a crumpled mass just where the body of Nofret had lain.",
    "Rousing herself Renisenb ran forward to her.",
    "Yahmose was calling and running down the\npath.",
    "Renisenb reached the body of her sisterinlaw and bent over it.",
    "Satipys eyes were open\nthe eyelids fluttering.",
    "Her lips were moving trying to speak.",
    "Renisenb bent closer over her.",
    "She was appalled by the glazed terror in Satipys eyes.",
    "Then the dying womans voice came.",
    "It was just a hoarse croak.",
    "Nofret...\nSatipys head fell back.",
    "Her jaw dropped.",
    "Hori had turned to meet Yahmose.",
    "The two men came up together.",
    "Renisenb turned on her brother.",
    "What did she call out up there before she fell\nYahmoses breath was coming in short jerks  he could hardly speak...\nShe looked past me  over my shoulder  as though she saw someone coming along the\npath  but there was no one  there was no one there.",
    "Hori assented\nThere was no one...\nYahmoses voice dropped to a low terrified whisper.",
    "And then she called out \nWhat did she say Renisenb demanded impatiently.",
    "She said  she said  his voice trembled  Nofret...\n\n\fChapter 12\nFIRST MONTH OF SUMMER 12TH DAY\nSo that is what you meant\nRenisenb flung the words at Hori more as an affirmation than as a question.",
    "She added softly under her breath with growing comprehension and horror\nIt was Satipy who killed Nofret...",
    "Sitting with her chin supported by her hands in the entrance to Horis little rock chamber\nnext to the Tomb Renisenb stared down at the valley below.",
    "She thought dreamily how true the words were she had uttered yesterday.",
    "Was it really\nonly such a short time ago From up here the house below and the busy hurrying figures\nhad no more significance nor meaning than an ants nest.",
    "Only the sun majestic in power shining overhead  only the slim streak of pale silver that\nwas the Nile in this morning light  only these were eternal and enduring Khay had died\nand Nofret and Satipy  and someday she and Hori would die.",
    "But Re would still rule the\nHeavens and travel by night in his barque through the Underworld to the dawning of the\nnext day.",
    "And the River would still flow flow from beyond Elephantine and down past\nThebes and past the village and to lower Egypt where Nofret had lived and been gay and\nlight of heart and on to the great waters and so away from Egypt altogether.",
    "Satipy and Nofret...\nRenisenb pursued her thoughts aloud since Hori had not answered her last demand.",
    "You see I was so sure that Sobek \nShe broke off.",
    "Hori said thoughtfully\nThe preconceived idea.",
    "And yet it was stupid of me Renisenb went on.",
    "Henet told me or more or less told me\nthat Satipy had gone walking this way and she said that Nofret had come up here.",
    "I ought\nto have seen how obvious it was that Satipy had followed Nofret  that they had met on the\npath  and that Satipy had thrown her down.",
    "She had said only a short while before that\nshe was a better man than any of my brothers.",
    "Renisenb broke off and shivered.",
    "And when I met her she resumed I should have known then.",
    "She was quite different she was frightened.",
    "She tried to persuade me to turn back with her.",
    "She didnt want me to\nfind Nofrets body.",
    "I must have been blind not to realize the truth.",
    "But I was so full of fear\nabout Sobek...",
    "I know.",
    "It was seeing him kill that snake.",
    "Renisenb agreed eagerly.",
    "Yes that was it.",
    "And then I had a dream... Poor Sobek  how I have misjudged him.",
    "As\nyou say threatening is not doing.",
    "Sobek has always been full of boastful talk.",
    "It was Satipy\nwho was always bold and ruthless and not afraid of action.",
    "And then ever since  the way\nshe has gone about like a ghost  it has puzzled us all.",
    "Why did we not think of the true\nexplanation\nShe added with a quick upward glance\nBut you did\nFor some time said Hori I have felt convinced that the clue to the truth of Nofrets\ndeath was in Satipys extraordinary change of character.",
    "It was so remarkable that there\n\n\fhad to be something to account for it.",
    "And yet you said nothing\nHow could I Renisenb What could I ever prove\nNo of course not.",
    "Proofs must be solid brick walls of fact.",
    "Yet once you said Renisenb argued that people did not really change.",
    "But now you\nadmit that Satipy did change.",
    "Hori smiled at her.",
    "You should argue in the Nomarchs courts.",
    "No Renisenb what I said was true enough people are always themselves.",
    "Satipy like Sobek was all bold words and talk.",
    "She indeed\nmight go on from talk to action  but I think she is one of those who cannot know a thing or\nwhat it is like until it has happened.",
    "In her life up to that particular day she had never had\nanything to fear.",
    "When fear came it took her unawares.",
    "She learned then that courage is\nthe resolution to face the unforeseen  and she had not got that courage.",
    "Renisenb murmured in a low voice\nWhen fear came...",
    "Yes that is what has been with us ever since Nofret died.",
    "Satipy has\ncarried it in her face for us all to see.",
    "It was there staring from her eyes when she died...\nhen she said Nofret...",
    "It was as though she saw \nRenisenb stopped herself.",
    "She turned her face to Hori her eyes wide with a question.",
    "Hori what did she see There on the path.",
    "We saw nothing There was nothing.",
    "Not for us  no.",
    "But for her It was Nofret she saw  Nofret come to take her revenge.",
    "But Nofret is dead\nand her tomb is sealed.",
    "What then did she see\nThe picture that her own mind showed her.",
    "You are sure Because if not \nYes Renisenb if not\nHori  Renisenb stretched out her hand.",
    "Is it ended now Now that Satipy is dead Is it\ntruly ended\nHe held her hand in both of his in a comforting clasp.",
    "Yes yes Renisenb  surely.",
    "And you at least need not be afraid.",
    "Renisenb murmured under her breath\nBut Esa says that Nofret hated me...\nNofret hated you\nEsa says so.",
    "Nofret was good at hating said Hori.",
    "Sometimes I think she hated every person in this\nhouse.",
    "But you at least did nothing against her.",
    "No  no that is true.",
    "And therefore Renisenb there is nothing in your mind to rise up against you in\njudgment.",
    "You mean Hori that if I were to walk down this path alone  at sunset  at that same time\nwhen Nofret died  and if I were to turn my head  I should see nothing I should be safe\nYou will be safe Renisenb because if you walk down the path I will walk with you and\nno harm shall come to you.",
    "But Renisenb frowned and shook her head.",
    "No Hori.",
    "I will walk alone.",
    "But why little Renisenb Will you not be afraid\nYes said Renisenb I think I shall be afraid.",
    "But all the same that is what has to be\n\n\fdone.",
    "They are all trembling and shaking in the house and running to the temples to buy\namulets and crying out that it is not well to walk on this path at the hour of sundown.",
    "But it\nwas not magic that made Satipy sway and fall  it was fear  fear because of an evil thing\nthat she had done.",
    "For it is evil to take away life from someone who is young and strong\nand who enjoys living.",
    "But I have not done any evil thing and so even if Nofret did hate\nme her hate cannot harm me.",
    "That is what I believe.",
    "And anyway if one is to live always in\nfear it would be better to die  so I will overcome fear.",
    "Those are brave words Renisenb.",
    "They are perhaps rather braver than I feel Hori.",
    "She smiled up at him.",
    "She rose to her\nfeet.",
    "But it has been good to say them.",
    "Hori rose and stood beside her.",
    "I shall remember these words of yours Renisenb.",
    "Yes and the way you threw back your\nhead when you said them.",
    "They show the courage and the truth that I have always felt were\nin your heart.",
    "He took her hand in his.",
    "Look Renisenb.",
    "Look out from here across the valley to the River and beyond.",
    "That is\nEgypt our land.",
    "Broken by war and strife for many long years divided into petty\nkingdoms but now  very soon  to come together and form once more a united land Upper and Lower Egypt once again welded into one  I hope and believe to recover her\nformer greatness In those days Egypt will need men and women of heart and courage women such as you are Renisenb.",
    "It is not men like Imhotep forever preoccupied with his\nown narrow gains and losses nor men like Sobek idle and boastful nor boys like Ipy who\nthinks only of what he can gain for himself no nor even conscientious honest sons like\nYahmose whom Egypt will need in that hour.",
    "Sitting here literally amongst the dead\nreckoning up gains and losses casting accounts I have come to see gains that cannot be\nreckoned in terms of wealth and losses that are more damaging than loss of a crop...",
    "I look\nat the River and I see the lifeblood of Egypt that has existed before we lived and that will\nexist after we die... Life and death Renisenb are not of such great account.",
    "I am only Hori\nImhoteps man of business but when I look out over Egypt I know a peace  yes and an\nexultation that I would not exchange to be Governor of the Province.",
    "Do you understand at\nall what I mean Renisenb\nI think so Hori  a little.",
    "You are different from the others down there  I have known\nthat for some time.",
    "And sometimes when I am with you here I can feel what you feel  but\ndimly  not very clearly.",
    "But I do know what you mean.",
    "When I am here the things down\nthere  she pointed  do not seem to matter any longer  the quarrels and the hatreds and\nthe incessant bustle and fuss.",
    "Here one escapes from all that.",
    "She paused her brow puckering and went on stammering a little\nSometimes I  I am glad to have escaped.",
    "And yet  I do not know  there is something down there  that calls me back.",
    "Hori dropped her hand and stepped back a pace.",
    "He said gently\nYes  I see  Kameni singing in the courtyard.",
    "What do you mean Hori I was not thinking of Kameni.",
    "You may not have been thinking of him.",
    "But all the same Renisenb I think it is his songs\nthat you are hearing without knowing it.",
    "Renisenb stared at him her brow puckered.",
    "What extraordinary things you say Hori.",
    "One could not possibly hear him singing up\nhere.",
    "It is much too far away.",
    "Hori sighed gently and shook his head.",
    "The amusement in his eyes puzzled her.",
    "She felt a\nlittle angry and bewildered because she could not understand.",
    "Chapter 13\nFIRST MONTH OF SUMMER 23RD DAY\nCan I speak with you a minute Esa\nEsa peered sharply towards Henet who stood in the doorway of the room an ingratiating\nsmile upon her face.",
    "What is it the old woman asked sharply.",
    "Its nothing really  at least I dont suppose so  but I thought Id just like to ask \nEsa cut her short.",
    "Come in then come in.",
    "And you  she tapped the little black slave girl who was\nthreading beads on the shoulder with her stick  go to the kitchen.",
    "Get me some olives and make me a drink of pomegranate juice.",
    "The little girl ran off and Esa beckoned Henet impatiently.",
    "Its just this Esa.",
    "Esa peered down at the article Henet was holding out to her.",
    "It was a small jewel box with a\nsliding lid the top fastened with two buttons.",
    "What about it\nIts hers.",
    "And I found it now  in her room.",
    "Who are you talking about Satipy\nNo no Esa.",
    "The other.",
    "Nofret you mean What of it\nAll her jewels and her toilet vases and her perfume jars  everything  was buried with\nher.",
    "Esa twirled the string from the buttons and opened the box.",
    "In it was a string of small\ncamelian beads and half of a green glazed amulet which had been broken in two.",
    "Pooh said Esa.",
    "Nothing much here.",
    "It must have been overlooked.",
    "The embalmers men took everything away.",
    "Embalmers men arent any more reliable than anyone else.",
    "They forgot this.",
    "I tell you Esa  this wasnt in the room when last I looked in.",
    "Esa looked up sharply at Henet.",
    "What are you trying to make out That Nofret has come back from the Underworld and\nis here in the house Youre not really a fool Henet though you sometimes like to pretend\nyoure one.",
    "What pleasure do you get from spreading these silly magical tales\nHenet was shaking her head portentously.",
    "We all know what happened to Satipy  and why\nMaybe we do said Esa.",
    "And maybe some of us knew it before Eh Henet Ive always\nhad an idea you knew more about how Nofret came to her death than the rest of us.",
    "Oh Esa surely you wouldnt think for a moment \nEsa cut her short.",
    "What wouldnt I think Im not afraid of thinking Henet.",
    "Ive seen Satipy creeping about\nthe house for the last two months looking frightened to death  and its occurred to me since\n\n\fyesterday that someone might have known what shed done to Nofret and that that\nsomeone might have been holding the knowledge over her head  threatening maybe to tell\nYahmose  or Imhotep himself \nHenet burst into a shrill clamor of protestations and exclamations.",
    "Esa closed her eyes and\nleaned back in her chair.",
    "I dont suppose for a moment youd ever admit you did such a thing.",
    "Im not expecting\nyou to.",
    "Why should I Thats what I ask you  why should I\nIve not the least idea said Esa.",
    "You do a lot of things Henet for which Ive never been\nable to find a satisfactory reason.",
    "I suppose you think I was trying to make her bribe me to silence.",
    "I swear by the Nine\nGods of the Ennead \nDo not trouble the Gods.",
    "Youre honest enough Henet  as honesty goes.",
    "And it may be\nthat you knew nothing about how Nofret came to her death.",
    "But you know most things that\ngo on in this house.",
    "And if I were going to do any swearing myself Id swear that you put\nthis box in Nofrets room yourself  though why I cant imagine.",
    "But theres some reason\nbehind it... You can deceive Imhotep with your tricks but you cant deceive me.",
    "And dont\nwhine Im an old woman and I cannot stand people whining.",
    "Go and whine to Imhotep.",
    "He\nseems to like it though Re alone knows why\nI will take the box to Imhotep and tell him \nIll hand the box to him myself.",
    "Be off with you Henet and stop spreading these silly\nsuperstitious tales.",
    "The house is a more peaceful place without Satipy.",
    "Nofret dead has\ndone more for us than Nofret living.",
    "But now that the debt is paid let everyone return to\ntheir everyday tasks.",
    "II\nWhat is all this Imhotep demanded as he came fussily into Esas room a few minutes\nlater.",
    "Henet is deeply distressed.",
    "She came to me with the tears running down her face.",
    "Why nobody in the house can show that devoted woman the most ordinary kindness \nEsa unmoved gave a cackle of laughter.",
    "Imhotep went on\nYou have accused her I understand of stealing a box  a jewel box.",
    "Is that what she told you I did nothing of the sort.",
    "Here is the box.",
    "It seems it was found\nin Nofrets room.",
    "Imhotep took it from her.",
    "Ah yes it is one I gave her.",
    "He opened it.",
    "Hm nothing much inside.",
    "Very careless of\nthe embalmers not to have included it with the rest of her personal belongings.",
    "Considering\nthe prices Ipi and Montu charge one could at least expect no carelessness.",
    "Well this all\nseems to me a great fuss about nothing \nQuite so.",
    "I will give the box to Kait  no to Renisenb.",
    "She always behaved with courtesy towards\nNofret.",
    "He sighed.",
    "How impossible it seems for a man to get any peace.",
    "These women  endless tears or else\nquarrels and bickerings.",
    "Ah well Imhotep there is at least one woman less now\nYes indeed.",
    "My poor Yahmose All the same Esa  I feel that  er  it may be all for the\nbest.",
    "Satipy bore healthy children it is true but she was in many ways a most\nunsatisfactory wife.",
    "Yahmose of course gave in to her far too much.",
    "Well well all that is\nover now.",
    "I must say that I have been much pleased with Yahmoses behavior of late.",
    "He\nseems much more selfreliant  less timid  and his judgment on several points has been\nexcellent  quite excellent...",
    "He was always a good obedient boy.",
    "Yes yes  but inclined to be slow and somewhat afraid of responsibility.",
    "Esa said drily\nResponsibility is a thing you have never allowed him to have\nWell all that will be changed now.",
    "I am arranging a deed of association and partnership.",
    "It will be signed in a few days time.",
    "I am associating with myself all my three sons.",
    "Surely not Ipy\nHe would be hurt to be left out.",
    "Such a dear warmhearted lad.",
    "There is certainly nothing slow about him observed Esa.",
    "As you say.",
    "And Sobek too  I have been displeased with him in the past but he has really\nturned over a new leaf of late.",
    "He no longer idles his time away and he defers more to my\njudgment and to that of Yahmose.",
    "This is indeed a hymn of praise said Esa.",
    "Well Imhotep I must say that I think you\nare doing the right thing.",
    "It was bad policy to make your sons discontented.",
    "But I still think\nthat Ipy is too young for what you propose.",
    "It is ridiculous to give a boy of that age a\ndefinite position.",
    "What hold will you have over him\nThere is something in that certainly.",
    "Imhotep looked thoughtful.",
    "Then he roused himself.",
    "I must go.",
    "There are a thousand things to see to.",
    "The embalmers are here  there are all\nthe arrangements to make for Satipys burial.",
    "These deaths are costly  very costly.",
    "And\nfollowing so quickly one upon the other\nOh well said Esa consolingly well hope this is the last of them  until my time comes\nYou will live many years yet I hope my dear mother.",
    "Im sure you hope so said Esa with a grin.",
    "No economy over me if you please It\nwouldnt look well I shall want a good deal of equipment to amuse me in the other world.",
    "Plenty of food and drink and a lot of models of slaves  a richly ornamented gaming board\nperfume sets and cosmetics and I insist on the most expensive canopic jars  the alabaster\nones.",
    "Yes yes of course.",
    "Imhotep changed his position nervously from one foot to the other.",
    "Naturally all respect will be paid when the sad day comes.",
    "I must confess that I feel rather\ndifferently about Satipy.",
    "One does not want a scandal but really in the circumstances \nImhotep did nor finish his sentence but hurried away.",
    "Esa smiled sardonically as she realized that that one phrase in the circumstances was the\nnearest Imhotep would ever get towards admitting that an accident did not fully describe\nthe way his valued concubine had met her death.",
    "Chapter 14\nFIRST MONTH OF SUMMER 25TH DAY\n\n\fWith the return of the members of the family from the Nomarchs court the deed of\nassociation duly ratified a general spirit of hilarity was felt.",
    "The exception was\nundoubtedly Ipy who had at the last moment been excluded from participation on the\nground of his extreme youth.",
    "He was sullen in consequence and purposely absented himself\nfrom the house.",
    "Imhotep in excellent spirits called for a pitcher of wine to be brought out onto the porch\nwhere it was placed in the big wine stand.",
    "You shall drink my son he declared clapping Yahmose on the shoulder.",
    "Forget for the\nmoment your sorrow in bereavement.",
    "Let us think only of the good days that are to come.",
    "Imhotep Yahmose Sobek and Hori drank the toast.",
    "Then word was brought that an ox\nhad been stolen and all four men went hurriedly off to verify the report.",
    "When Yahmose reentered the courtyard an hour later he was tired and hot.",
    "He went to\nwhere the wine jar still stood in the stand.",
    "He dipped a bronze cup into it and sat down on\nthe porch gently sipping the wine.",
    "A little later Sobek came striding in and exclaimed with\npleasure.",
    "Ha he said.",
    "Now for more wine Let us drink to our future which is at last\nwellassured.",
    "Undoubtedly this is a joyful day for us Yahmose\nYahmose agreed.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "It will make life easier in every way.",
    "You are always so moderate in your feelings Yahmose.",
    "Sobek laughed as he spoke and dipping a cup in the wine he tossed it off smacking his lips\nas he put it down.",
    "Let us see now whether my father will be as much of a stickinthemud as ever or\nwhether I shall be able to convert him to uptodate methods.",
    "I should go slowly if I were you Yahmose counselled.",
    "You are always so hotheaded.",
    "Sobek smiled at his brother affectionately.",
    "He was in high goodhumor.",
    "Old slowandsure he said scoffingly.",
    "Yahmose smiled not at all put out.",
    "It is the best way in the end.",
    "Besides my father has been very good to us.",
    "We must do\nnothing to cause him worry.",
    "Sobek looked at him curiously.",
    "You are really fond of our father You are an affectionate creature Yahmose Now I  I\ncare for nobody  for nobody that is but Sobek long life to him\nHe took another draught of wine.",
    "Be careful Yahmose said warningly.",
    "You have eaten little today.",
    "Sometimes then\nwhen one drinks wine \nHe broke off with a sudden contortion of the lips.",
    "What is the matter Yahmose\nNothing  a sudden pain  I it is nothing...",
    "But he raised a hand to wipe his forehead which was suddenly bedewed with moisture.",
    "You do not look well.",
    "I was quite all right just now.",
    "So long as nobody has poisoned the wine.",
    "Sobek laughed at his own words and stretched\nout his arm toward the jar.",
    "Then in the very act his arm stiffened his body bent forward\nin a sudden spasm of agony...\nYahmose he gasped.",
    "Yahmose...",
    "I  too...\n\n\fYahmose slipping forward was bent double.",
    "A halfstifled cry came from him.",
    "Sobek was now contorted with pain.",
    "He raised his voice.",
    "Help.",
    "Send for a physician  a physician...\nHenet came running out of the house.",
    "You called What was it that you said What is it\nHer alarmed cries brought others.",
    "The two brothers were both groaning with pain.",
    "Yahmose said faintly\nThe wine  poison  send for a physician...\nHenet uttered a shrill cry\nMore misfortune.",
    "In truth this house is accursed.",
    "Quick Hurry Send to the Temple for\nthe Divine Father Mersu who is a skilled physician of great experience.",
    "II\nImhotep paced up and down the central hall of the house.",
    "His fine linen robe was soiled\nand limp he had neither bathed nor changed.",
    "His face was drawn with worry and fear.",
    "From the back of the house came a low sound of keening and weeping  the womens\ncontribution to the catastrophe that had overrun the household  Henets voice led the\nmourners.",
    "From a room at the side the voice of the physician and priest Mersu was heard raised as he\nstrove over the inert body of Yahmose.",
    "Renisenb stealing quietly out of the womens\nquarters into the central hall was drawn by the sound.",
    "Her feet took her to the open\ndoorway and she paused there feeling a healing balm in the sonorous words that the priest\nwas reciting.",
    "O Isis great of magic loose thou me release thou me from all things bad evil and red\nfrom the stroke of a God from the stroke of a Goddess from dead man or dead woman\nfrom a male foe or a female foe who may oppose himself to me...\nA faint sigh came fluttering from Yahmoses lips.",
    "In her heart Renisenb joined in the prayer.",
    "O Isis  O great Isis  save him  save my brother Yahmose  Thou who art great of\nmagic...",
    "Thoughts passed confusedly through her mind raised there by the words of the\nincantation.",
    "From all things bad evil and red... That is what has been the matter with us here in this\nhouse  yes red thoughts angry thoughts  the anger of a dead woman.",
    "She spoke within the confines of her thoughts directly addressing the person in her mind.",
    "It was not Yahmose who harmed you Nofret  and though Satipy was his wife you cannot\nhold him responsible for her actions  he never had any control over her  no one had.",
    "Satipy who harmed you is dead.",
    "Is that not enough Sobek is dead  Sobek who only spoke\nagainst you yet never actually harmed you.",
    "O Isis do not let Yahmose also die  save him\nfrom the vengeful hatred of Nofret.",
    "Imhotep pacing distractedly up and down looked up and saw his daughter and his face\nrelaxed with affection.",
    "Come here Renisenb dear child.",
    "She ran to him and he put his arm round her.",
    "Oh Father what do they say\nImhotep said heavily\nThey say that in Yahmoses case there is hope.",
    "Sobek  you know\nYes yes.",
    "Have you not heard us wailing\nHe died at dawn said Imhotep.",
    "Sobek my strong handsome son.",
    "His voice faltered\nand broke.",
    "Oh it is wicked cruel  Could nothing be done\nAll was done that could be.",
    "Potions forcing him to vomit.",
    "Administration of the juice of\npotent herbs.",
    "Sacred amulets were applied and mighty incantations spoken.",
    "All was of no\navail.",
    "Mersu is a skilled physician.",
    "If he could not save my son  then it was the will of the\nGods that he should not be saved.",
    "The priestphysicians voice rose in a final high chant and he came out from the chamber\nwiping the perspiration from his forehead.",
    "Well Imhotep accosted him eagerly.",
    "The physician said gravely\nBy the favor of Isis your son will live.",
    "He is weak but the crisis of the poison has passed.",
    "The evil influence is on the wane.",
    "He went on slightly altering his tone to a more everyday intonation.",
    "It is fortunate that Yahmose drank much less of the poisoned wine.",
    "He sipped his wine\nwhereas it seems your son Sobek tossed it off at a draught.",
    "Imhotep groaned.",
    "You have there the difference between them.",
    "Yahmose timid cautious and slow in his\napproach to everything even eating and drinking.",
    "Sobek always given to excess generous\nfreehanded  alas imprudent.",
    "Then he added sharply\nAnd the wine was definitely poisoned\nThere is no doubt of that Imhotep.",
    "The residue was tested by my young assistants  of the\nanimals treated with it all died more or less swiftly.",
    "And yet I who had drunk of the same wine not an hour earlier have felt no ill effects.",
    "It was doubtless not poisoned at that time  the poison was added afterwards.",
    "Imhotep struck the palm of one hand with his other hand clenched into a fist.",
    "No one he declared no one living would dare to poison my sons here under my roof\nSuch a thing is impossible.",
    "No living person I say\nMersu inclined his head slightly.",
    "His face became inscrutable.",
    "Of that Imhotep you are the best judge.",
    "Imhotep stood scratching nervously behind his ear.",
    "There is a tale I would like you to hear he said abruptly.",
    "He clapped his hands and as a servant ran in he called\nBring the herd boy here.",
    "He turned back to Mersu saying\nThis is a boy whose wits are not of the best.",
    "He takes in what people say to him with\ndifficulty and he has not full possession of his faculties.",
    "Nevertheless he has eyes and his\neyesight is good and he is moreover devoted to my son Yahmose who has been gentle with\nhim and kindly to his infirmity.",
    "The servant came back dragging by the hand a thin almost blackskinned boy clad in a\nloincloth with slightly squinting eyes and a frightened witless face.",
    "Speak said Imhotep sharply.",
    "Repeat what you told me just now.",
    "The boy hung his head his fingers began kneading the cloth round his waist.",
    "Speak shouted Imhotep.",
    "Esa came hobbling in supported by her stick and peering with her dim eyes.",
    "You are terrifying the child.",
    "Here Renisenb give him this jujube.",
    "There boy tell us what\nyou saw.",
    "The boy gazed from one to the other of them.",
    "Esa prompted him.",
    "It was yesterday as you passed the door of the court yard  you saw  What did you see\nThe boy shook his head glancing sideways.",
    "He murmured\nWhere is my Lord Yahmose\nThe priest spoke with authority and kindliness.",
    "It is the wish of your Lord Yahmose that you tell us your tale.",
    "Have no fear.",
    "No one will\nharm you.",
    "A gleam of light passed over the boys face.",
    "My Lord Yahmose has been good to me.",
    "I will do what he wishes.",
    "He paused.",
    "Imhotep seemed about to break out but a look from the physician restrained\nhim.",
    "Suddenly the boy spoke nervously in a quick gabble and with a look from side to side as\nhe spoke as though he was afraid that some unseen presence would overhear him.",
    "It was the little donkey  protected by Set and always up to mischief.",
    "I ran after him with\nmy stick.",
    "He went past the big gate of the courtyard and I looked in through the gate at the\nhouse.",
    "There was no one on the porch but there was a wine stand there.",
    "And then a woman\na lady of the house came out upon the porch from the house.",
    "She walked to the wine jar\nand she held out her hands over it and then  and then  she went back into the house I\nthink.",
    "I do not know.",
    "For I heard footsteps and turned and saw in the distance my Lord\nYahmose coming back from the fields.",
    "So I went on seeking the little donkey and my Lord\nYahmose went into the courtyard.",
    "And you did not warn him cried Imhotep angrily.",
    "You said nothing.",
    "The boy cried out I did not know anything was wrong.",
    "I saw nothing but the lady\nstanding there smiling down as she spread out her hand over the wine jar...",
    "I saw\nnothing...\nWho was this lady boy asked the priest.",
    "With a vacant expression the boy shook his head.",
    "I do not know.",
    "She must have been one of the ladies of the house.",
    "I do not know them.",
    "I\nhave the herds at the far end of the cultivation.",
    "She wore a dress of dyed linen.",
    "Renisenb started.",
    "A servant perhaps suggested the priest watching the boy.",
    "The boy shook his head positively.",
    "She was not a servant... She had a wig on her head and she wore jewels  a servant does\nnot wear jewels.",
    "Jewels demanded Imhotep.",
    "What jewels\nThe boy replied eagerly and confidently as though at last he had overcome his fear and was\nquite sure of what he was saying.",
    "Three strings of beads with gold lions hanging from them in front...\nEsas stick clattered to the floor.",
    "Imhotep uttered a stifled cry.",
    "Mersu said threateningly\nIf you are lying boy \nIt is the truth.",
    "I swear it is the truth.",
    "The boys voice rose shrill and clear.",
    "From the side chamber where the ill man lay Yahmose called feebly\nWhat is all this\nThe boy darted through the open door and crouched down by the couch on which Yahmose\nlay.",
    "Master they will torture me.",
    "No no.",
    "Yahmose turned his head with difficulty on the curved wooden headrest.",
    "Do\nnot let the child be hurt.",
    "He is simple but honest.",
    "Promise me.",
    "Of course of course said Imhotep.",
    "There is no need.",
    "It is clear the boy has told all that\nhe knows  and I do not think he is inventing.",
    "Be off with you child but do not return to\nthe far herds.",
    "Stay near the house so that we can summon you again if we need you.",
    "The boy rose to his feet.",
    "He bent a reluctant glance upon Yahmose.",
    "You are ill Lord Yahmose\nYahmose smiled faintly.",
    "Have no fear.",
    "I am not going to die.",
    "Go now  and be obedient to what you have been\ntold.",
    "Smiling happily now the boy went off.",
    "The priest examined Yahmoses eyes and felt the\nrate at which the blood was coursing under the skin.",
    "Then recommending him to sleep he\nwent with the others out into the central hall again.",
    "He said to Imhotep\nYou recognize the description the boy gave\nImhotep nodded.",
    "His deep bronze cheeks showed a sickly plum color.",
    "Renisenb said Only Nofret ever wore a dress of dyed linen.",
    "It was a new fashion she\nbrought with her from the cities in the north.",
    "But those dresses were buried with her.",
    "Imhotep said\nAnd the three strings of beads with the lions heads in gold were what I gave her.",
    "There is\nno other such ornament in the house it was costly and unusual.",
    "All her jewelry with the\nexception of a trumpery string of camelian beads was buried with her and is sealed in her\ntomb.",
    "He flung out his arms.",
    "What persecution  what vindictiveness  is this My concubine whom I treated well to\nwhom I paid all honor whom I buried with the proper rites sparing no expense.",
    "I have\neaten and drunk with her in friendship  to that all can bear witness.",
    "She had had nothing\nof which to complain  I did indeed more for her than would have been considered right\nand fitting.",
    "I was prepared to favor her to the detriment of my sons who were born to me.",
    "Why then should she thus come back from the dead to persecute me and my family\nMersu said gravely\nIt seems that it is not against you personally that the dead woman wishes evil.",
    "The wine\nwhen you drank it was harmless.",
    "Who in your family did injury to your dead concubine\nA woman who is dead Imhotep answered shortly.",
    "I see.",
    "You mean the wife of your son Yahmose\nYes.",
    "Imhotep paused then broke out But what can be done Reverend Father How\ncan we counteract this malice Oh evil day when I first took the woman into my house\nAn evil day indeed said Kait in a deep voice coming forward from the entrance to the\n\n\fwomens quarters.",
    "Her eyes were heavy with the tears she had shed and her plain face had a strength and\nresolution which made it noticeable.",
    "Her voice deep and hoarse was shaken with anger.",
    "It was an evil day when you brought Nofret here Imhotep to destroy the cleverest and\nmost handsome of your sons She has brought death to Satipy and death to my Sobek and\nYahmose has only narrowly escaped.",
    "Who will be next Will she spare even children  she\nwho struck my little Ankh Something must be done Imhotep\nSomething must be done Imhotep echoed looking imploringly at the priest.",
    "The latter nodded his head with calm assumption.",
    "There are ways and means Imhotep.",
    "Once we are sure of our facts we can go ahead.",
    "I\nhave in mind your dead wife Ashayet.",
    "She was a woman of influential family.",
    "She can\ninvoke powerful interests in the Land of the Dead who can intervene on your behalf and\nagainst whom the woman Nofret will have no power.",
    "We must take counsel together.",
    "Kait gave a short laugh.",
    "Do not wait too long.",
    "Men are always the same  Yes even priests Everything must be\ndone according to law and precedent.",
    "But I say act quickly  or there will be more dead\nbeneath this roof.",
    "She turned and went out.",
    "An excellent woman murmured Imhotep.",
    "A devoted mother to her children a dutiful\nwife  but her manners sometimes are hardly what they should be  to the head of the\nhouse.",
    "Naturally at such a time I forgive her.",
    "We are all distraught.",
    "We hardly know what\nwe are doing.",
    "He clasped his hands to his head.",
    "Some of us seldom do know what we are doing remarked Esa.",
    "Imhotep shot an annoyed glance at her.",
    "The physician prepared to take his leave and\nImhotep went out with him onto the porch receiving instructions for the care of the sick\nman.",
    "Renisenb left behind looked inquiringly at her grandmother.",
    "Esa was sitting very still.",
    "She was frowning and the expression on her face was so curious\nthat Renisenb asked timidly\nWhat is it that you are thinking Grandmother\nThinking is the word Renisenb.",
    "Such curious things are happening in this house that it is\nvery necessary for someone to think.",
    "They are terrible said Renisenb with a shiver.",
    "They frighten me.",
    "They frighten me said Esa.",
    "But not perhaps for the same reason.",
    "With the old familiar gesture she pushed the wig on her head askew.",
    "But Yahmose will not die now said Renisenb.",
    "He will live.",
    "Esa nodded.",
    "Yes a master physician reached him in time.",
    "On another occasion though he may not be\nso lucky.",
    "You think  there will be other happenings like this\nI think that Yahmose and you and Ipy  and perhaps Kait too had better be very careful\nindeed what you eat and drink.",
    "See always that a slave tastes it first.",
    "And you Grandmother\nEsa smiled her sardonic smile.",
    "I Renisenb am an old woman and I love life as only the old can savoring every hour\n\n\fevery minute that is left to them.",
    "Of you all I have the best chance of life  because I shall\nbe more careful than any of you.",
    "And my father Surely Nofret would wish no evil to my father\nYour father I do not know... No I do not know.",
    "I cannot as yet see clearly.",
    "Tomorrow\nwhen I have thought about it all I must speak once more with that herd boy.",
    "There was\nsomething about his story \nShe broke off frowning.",
    "Then with a sigh she rose to her feet and helping herself with her\nstick limped slowly back to her own quarters.",
    "Renisenb went into her brothers room.",
    "He was sleeping and she crept out again softly.",
    "After a moments hesitation she went to Kaits quarters.",
    "She stood in the doorway\nunnoticed watching Kait sing one of the children to sleep.",
    "Kaits face was calm and placid\nagain  she looked so much as usual that for a moment Renisenb felt that the tragic\noccurrences of the last twentyfour hours were a dream.",
    "She turned slowly away and went to her own apartment.",
    "On a table amongst her own\ncosmetic boxes and jars was the little jewel case that had belonged to Nofret.",
    "Renisenb picked it up and stood looking at it as it lay on the palm of her hand.",
    "Nofret had\ntouched it had held it  it was her possession.",
    "And again a wave of pity swept over Renisenb allied to that queer sense of understanding.",
    "Nofret had been unhappy.",
    "As she had held this little box in her hand perhaps she had\ndeliberately forced that unhappiness into malice and hatred... and even now that hatred\nwas unabated... was still seeking revenge... Oh no surely not  surely not\nAlmost mechanically Renisenb twisted the two buttons and slid back the lid.",
    "The camelian\nbeads were there and the broken amulet and something else...",
    "Her heart beating violently Renisenb drew out a necklace of gold beads with gold lions in\nfront...\nChapter 15\nFIRST MONTH OF SUMMER 30TH DAY\nThe finding of the necklace frightened Renisenb badly.",
    "On the impulse of the minute she replaced it quickly in the jewel box slid home the lid and\ntied the string round the buttons again.",
    "Her instinct was to conceal her discovery.",
    "She even\nglanced fearfully behind her to make sure that no one had watched what she had been\ndoing.",
    "She passed a sleepless night twisting to and fro uneasily and settling and resettling her\nhead on the curved wooden headrest of her bed.",
    "By the morning she had decided that she must confide in someone.",
    "She could not bear the\nweight of that disturbing discovery alone.",
    "Twice in the night she had started up wondering\nif perhaps she might perceive Nofrets figure standing menacingly by her side.",
    "But there\nwas nothing to be seen.",
    "Taking the lion necklace from the jewel box Renisenb hid it in the folds of her linen dress.",
    "She had only just done so when Henet came bustling in.",
    "Her eyes were bright and sharp\nwith the pleasure of having fresh news to impart.",
    "Just imagine Renisenb isnt it terrible That boy  the herd boy you know  fast asleep\nthis morning out by the cornbins and everyone shaking him and yelling in his ear  and\nnow it seems that hell never wake again.",
    "Its as though hed drunk the poppy juice  and\n\n\fmaybe he did  but if so who gave it to him Nobody here that Ill be bound.",
    "And its not\nlikely hed take it himself.",
    "Oh we might have known how it would be yesterday.",
    "Henets\nhand went to one of the many amulets she wore.",
    "Amun protect us against the evil spirits\nof the dead The boy told what he saw.",
    "He told how he saw Her.",
    "And so She came back and\ngave him poppy juice to close his eyes for ever.",
    "Oh Shes very powerful that Nofret Shed\nbeen abroad you know out of Egypt.",
    "I dare swear She got to know all sorts of outlandish\nprimitive magic.",
    "Were not safe in this house  none of us are safe.",
    "Your father should give\nseveral bulls to Amun  a whole herd if necessary  this isnt a time for economy.",
    "Weve got\nto protect ourselves.",
    "We must appeal to your mother  thats what Imhotep is planning to\ndo.",
    "The priest Mersu says so.",
    "A solemn Letter to the Dead.",
    "Hori is busy now drawing up\nthe terms of it.",
    "Your father was for addressing it to Nofret  appealing to her.",
    "You know\nMost excellent Nofret what evil thing have I ever done to you etc.",
    "But as the Divine\nFather Mersu pointed out it needs stronger measures than that.",
    "Now your mother\nAshayet was a great lady.",
    "Her mothers brother was the Nomarch and her brother was\nChief Butler to the Vizier at Thebes.",
    "If its once brought to her knowledge shell see to it\nthat a mere concubine isnt allowed to destroy her own children Oh yes well get justice\ndone.",
    "As I say Hori is drawing up the plea to her now.",
    "It had been Renisenbs intention to seek out Hori and tell him about her finding of the lion\nnecklace.",
    "But if Hori were busy with the priests at the Temple of Isis it was hopeless to\nthink of trying to get hold of him alone.",
    "Should she go to her father Dissatisfied Renisenb shook her head.",
    "Her old childish belief\nin her fathers omnipotence had quite passed away.",
    "She realized now how quickly in times\nof crisis he went to pieces  a fussy pomposity replacing any real strength.",
    "If Yahmose were\nnot ill she could have told him though she doubted if he would have any very practical\ncounsels to offer.",
    "He would probably insist on the matter being laid before Imhotep.",
    "And that Renisenb felt with increasing urgency was at all costs to be avoided.",
    "The first\nthing Imhotep would do would be to blazon the whole thing abroad and Renisenb had a\nstrong instinct for keeping it secret  though for what exact reason she would have been\nhard put to it to say.",
    "No it was Horis advice she wanted.",
    "Hori would as always know the right thing to do.",
    "He\nwould take the necklace from her and at the same time take her worry and perplexity\naway.",
    "He would look at her with those kind grave eyes and instantly she would feel that\nnow all was well...\nFor a moment Renisenb was tempted to confide in Kait  but Kait was unsatisfactory she\nnever listened properly.",
    "Perhaps if one got her away from the children  no it wouldnt do.",
    "Kait was nice but stupid.",
    "Renisenb thought There is Kameni... and there is my grandmother.",
    "Kameni...",
    "There was something pleasurable in the thought of telling Kameni.",
    "She could\nsee his face quite clearly in her thoughts  its expression changing from a merry challenge\nto interest  to apprehension on her behalf... Or would it not be on her behalf\nWhy this insidious lurking suspicion that Nofret and Kameni had been closer friends than\nhad appeared on the surface Because Kameni had helped Nofret in her campaign of\ndetaching Imhotep from his family He had protested that he could not help himself  but\nwas that true It was an easy thing to say.",
    "Everything Kameni said sounded easy and\nnatural and right.",
    "His laugh was so gay that you wanted to laugh too.",
    "The swing of his body\nwas so graceful as he walked  the turn of his head on those smooth bronze shoulders  his\n\n\feyes that looked at you  that looked at you  Renisenbs thought broke off confusedly.",
    "Kamenis eyes were not like Horis eyes safe and kind.",
    "They demanded they challenged.",
    "Renisenbs thoughts had brought blood into her cheeks and a sparkle into her eye.",
    "But she\ndecided that she would not tell Kameni about the finding of Nofrets necklace.",
    "No she\nwould go to Esa.",
    "Esa had impressed her yesterday.",
    "Old as she was the old woman had a\ngrasp of things and a shrewd practical sense that was unshared by anyone else in the\nfamily.",
    "Renisenb thought She is old.",
    "But she will know.",
    "II\nAt the first mention of the necklace Esa glanced quickly round placed a finger to her lips\nand held out her hand.",
    "Renisenb fumbled in her dress drew out the necklace and laid it in\nEsas hand.",
    "Esa held it for a moment close to her dim eyes then stowed it away in her\ndress.",
    "She said in a low authoritative voice\nNo more now.",
    "Talking in this house is talking to a hundred ears.",
    "I have lain awake most\nof the night thinking and there is much that must be done.",
    "My father and Hori have gone to the Temple of Isis to confer with the priest Mersu on the\ndrawing up of a petition to my mother for her intervention.",
    "I know.",
    "Well let your father concern himself with the spirits of the dead.",
    "My thoughts\ndeal with the things of this world.",
    "When Hori returns bring him here to me.",
    "There are\nthings that must be said and discussed  and Hori I can trust.",
    "Hori will know what to do said Renisenb happily.",
    "Esa looked at her curiously.",
    "You go often up to see him at the Tomb do you not What do you talk about you and\nHori\nRenisenb shook her head vaguely.",
    "Oh the River  and Egypt  and the way the light changes and the colors of the sand below\nand the rocks...",
    "But very often we do not talk at all.",
    "I just sit there and it is peaceful with\nno scolding voices and no crying children and no bustle of coming and going.",
    "I can think\nmy own thoughts and Hori does not interrupt them.",
    "And then sometimes I look up and\nfind him watching me and we both smile...",
    "I can be happy up there.",
    "Esa said slowly\nYou are lucky Renisenb.",
    "You have found the happiness that is inside everybodys own\nheart.",
    "To most women happiness means coming and going busied over small affairs.",
    "It is\ncare for ones children and laughter and conversation and quarrels with other women and\nalternate love and anger with a man.",
    "It is made up of small things strung together like\nbeads on a string.",
    "Has your life been like that Grandmother\nMost of it.",
    "But now that I am old and sit much alone and my sight is dim and I walk with\ndifficulty  then I realize that there is a life within as well as a life without.",
    "But I am too old\nnow to learn the true way of it  and so I scold my little maid and enjoy good food hot from\nthe kitchen and savor all the many different kinds of bread that we bake and enjoy ripe\ngrapes and the juice from pomegranates.",
    "These things remain when others go.",
    "The\nchildren that I have loved most are now dead.",
    "Your father Re help him was always a fool.",
    "I loved him when he was a toddling little boy but now he irritates me with his airs of\n\n\fimportance.",
    "Of my grandchildren I love you Renisenb  and talking of grandchildren\nwhere is Ipy I have not seen him today or yesterday.",
    "He is very busy superintending the storing of the grain.",
    "My father left him in charge.",
    "Esa grinned.",
    "That will please our young gander.",
    "He will be strutting about full of his own importance.",
    "When he comes in to eat tell him to come to me.",
    "Yes Esa.",
    "For the rest Renisenb silence...\nIII\nYou wanted to see me Grandmother\nIpy stood smiling and arrogant his head held a little on one side a flower held between his\nwhite teeth.",
    "He looked very pleased with himself and with life generally.",
    "If you can spare a moment of your valuable time said Esa screwing her eyes up to see\nbetter and looking him up and down.",
    "The acerbity of her tone made no impression on Ipy.",
    "It is true that I am very busy today.",
    "I have to oversee everything since my father has gone\nto the Temple.",
    "Young jackals bark loud said Esa.",
    "But Ipy was quite unperturbable.",
    "Come Grandmother you must have more to say to me than that.",
    "Certainly I have more to say.",
    "And to begin with this is a house of mourning.",
    "Your\nbrother Sobeks body is already in the hands of the embalmers.",
    "Yet your face is as cheerful\nas though this was a festival day.",
    "Ipy grinned.",
    "You are no hypocrite Esa.",
    "Would you have me be one You know very well that there\nwas no love lost between me and Sobek.",
    "He did everything he could to thwart and annoy\nme.",
    "He treated me as a child.",
    "He gave me all the most humiliating and childish tasks in the\nfields.",
    "Frequently he jeered and laughed at me.",
    "And when my father would have associated\nme with him in partnership together with my older brothers it was Sobek who persuaded\nhim not to do so.",
    "What makes you think it was Sobek who persuaded him asked Esa sharply.",
    "Kameni told me so.",
    "Kameni Esa raised her eyebrows pushed her wig on one side and scratched her head.",
    "Kameni indeed.",
    "Now I find that interesting.",
    "Kameni said he had it from Henet  and we all agree that Henet always knows\neverything.",
    "Nevertheless said Esa drily this is an occasion when Henet was wrong in her facts.",
    "Doubtless both Sobek and Yahmose were of the opinion that you were too young for the\nbusiness  but it was I  yes I  who dissuaded your father from including you.",
    "You Grandmother The boy stared at her in frank surprise.",
    "Then a dark scowl altered\nthe expression of his face the flower fell from his lips.",
    "Why should you do that What\nbusiness was it of yours\nMy familys business is my business.",
    "And my father listened to you\n\n\fNot at the moment said Esa drily.",
    "But I will teach you a lesson my handsome child.",
    "Women work roundabout  and they learn  if they are not born with the knowledge  to\nplay on the weaknesses of men.",
    "You may remember I sent Henet with the gaming board to\nthe porch in the cool of the evening.",
    "I remember.",
    "My father and I played together.",
    "What of it\nThis.",
    "You played three games.",
    "And each time being a much cleverer player you beat\nyour father.",
    "Yes.",
    "That is all said Esa closing her eyes.",
    "Your father like all inferior players did not like\nbeing beaten  especially by a chit of a boy.",
    "So he remembered my words  and he decided\nthat you were certainly too young to be given a share in the partnership.",
    "Ipy stared at her for a moment.",
    "Then he laughed  not a very pleasant laugh.",
    "You are clever Esa he said.",
    "Yes you may be old but you are clever.",
    "Decidedly you\nand I have the brains of the family.",
    "You have pegged out in the first match on our gaming\nboard.",
    "But you will see I shall win the second.",
    "So look to yourself Grandmother.",
    "I intend to said Esa.",
    "And in return for your words let me advise you to look to\nyourself.",
    "One of your brothers is dead the other has been near to death.",
    "You also are your\nfathers son  and you may go the same way.",
    "Ipy laughed scornfully.",
    "There is little fear of that.",
    "Why not You also threatened and insulted Nofret.",
    "Nofret Ipys scorn was unmistakable.",
    "What is in your mind demanded Esa sharply.",
    "I have my ideas Grandmother.",
    "And I can assure you that Nofret and her spirit tricks will\nnot worry me.",
    "Let her do her worst.",
    "There was a shrill wail behind him and Henet ran in crying out\nFoolish boy  imprudent child.",
    "Defying the dead And after weve all had a taste of her\nquality And not so much as an amulet on you for protection\nProtection I will protect myself.",
    "Get out of my way Henet.",
    "Ive got work to do.",
    "Those\nlazy peasants shall know what it is to have a real master over them.",
    "Pushing Henet aside Ipy strode out of the room.",
    "Esa cut short Henets wails and lamentations.",
    "Listen to me Henet and stop exclaiming about Ipy.",
    "He may know what he is doing or he\nmay not.",
    "His manner is very odd.",
    "But answer me this Did you tell Kameni that it was\nSobek who had persuaded Imhotep not to include Ipy in the deed of association\nHenets voice dropped to its usual whining key.",
    "Im sure Im far too busy in the house to waste my time running about telling people\nthings  and telling Kameni of all people.",
    "Im sure Id never speak a word to him if he\ndidnt come and speak to me.",
    "Hes got a pleasant manner as you must admit yourself Esa and Im not the only one who thinks so  oh dear no And if a young widow wants to make\na new contract well she usually fancies a handsome young man  though what Imhotep\nwould say Im sure I dont know.",
    "Kameni is only a junior scribe when all is said and\ndone.",
    "Never mind what Kameni is or isnt Did you tell him that it was Sobek who opposed Ipy\nbeing made a partner in the association\nWell really Esa I cant remember what I may or may not have said.",
    "I didnt actually go\n\n\fand tell anyone anything that much is sure.",
    "But a word passes here and there and you\nknow yourself that Sobek was saying  and Yahmose too for that matter though of course\nnot so loud nor so often  that Ipy was a mere boy and that it would never do  and for all I\nknow Kameni may have heard him say it himself and not got it from me at all.",
    "I never\ngossip  but after all a tongue is given one to speak with and Im not a deaf mute.",
    "That you most certainly are not said Esa.",
    "A tongue Henet may sometimes be a\nweapon.",
    "A tongue may cause a death  may cause more than one death.",
    "I hope your tongue\nHenet has not caused a death.",
    "Why Esa the things you say And whats in your mind Im sure I never say a word to\nanybody that I wouldnt be willing to let the whole world overhear.",
    "Im so devoted to the\nwhole family  Id die for anyone of them.",
    "Oh they underestimate old Henets devotion.",
    "I\npromised their dear mother \nHa said Esa cutting her short here comes my plump reed bird cooked with leeks and\ncelery.",
    "It smells delicious  cooked to a turn.",
    "Since youre so devoted Henet you can take a\nlittle mouthful from one side  just in case its poisoned.",
    "Esa Henet gave a squeal.",
    "Poisoned How can you say such things And cooked in our\nvery own kitchen.",
    "Well said Esa someones got to taste it  just in case.",
    "And it had better be you Henet\nsince youre so willing to die for any member of the family.",
    "I dont suppose it would be too\npainful a death.",
    "Come on Henet.",
    "Look how plump and juicy and tasty it is.",
    "No thanks I\ndont want to lose my little slave girl.",
    "Shes young and merry.",
    "Youve passed your best\ndays Henet and it wouldnt matter so much what happened to you.",
    "Now then  open your\nmouth...",
    "Delicious isnt it I declare  youre looking quite green in the face.",
    "Didnt you like\nmy little joke I dont believe you did.",
    "Ha ha he he\nEsa rolled about with merriment then composing herself suddenly she set greedily to work\nto eat her favorite dish.",
    "Chapter 16\nSECOND MONTH OF SUMMER 1ST DAY\nThe consultation at the Temple was over.",
    "The exact form of the petition had been drawn up\nand amended.",
    "Hori and two Temple scribes had been busily employed.",
    "Now at last the first\nstep had been taken.",
    "The priest signed that the draft of the petition should be read out.",
    "To the most excellent Spirit Ashayet\nThis from your brother and husband.",
    "Has the sister forgotten her brother Has the\nmother forgotten the children that were born to her Does not the most excellent Ashayet\nknow that a spirit of evil life menaces her children Already is Sobek her son passed to\nOsiris by means of poison.",
    "I treated you in life with all honor.",
    "I gave you jewels and dresses unguents and perfumes\nand oils for your limbs.",
    "Together we ate of good foods sitting in peace and amity with\ntables loaded before us.",
    "When you were ill I spared no expense.",
    "I procured for you a\nmaster physician.",
    "You were buried with all honor and with due ceremonies and all things\nneedful for your life in the hereafter were provided for you  servants and oxen and food\nand drink and jewels and raiment.",
    "I mourned for you many years  and after long long\nyears only did I take a concubine so that I might live as befits a man not yet old.",
    "This concubine it is that now does evil to your children.",
    "Do you not know of this\nPerchance you are in ignorance.",
    "Surely if Ashayet knows she will be swift to come to the\naid of the sons born to her.",
    "Is it that Ashayet knows but that evil is still done because the concubine Nofret is strong\nin evil magic Yet surely it is against your will most excellent Ashayet.",
    "Therefore reflect\nthat in the Field of Offerings you have great relatives and powerful helpers.",
    "The great and\nnoble Ipi Chief Butler to the Vizier.",
    "Invoke his aid Also your mothers brother the great\nand powerful Meriptah the Nomarch of the Province.",
    "Acquaint him with the shameful\ntruth Let it be brought before his court.",
    "Let witnesses be summoned.",
    "Let them testify\nagainst Nofret that she has done this evil.",
    "Let judgment be given and may Nofret be\ncondemned and let it be decreed that she do no more evil to this house.",
    "Oh excellent Ashayet if you are angry with this your brother Imhotep in that he did\nlisten to this womans evil persuasions and did threaten to do injustice to your children that\nwere born of you then reflect that it is not he alone that suffers but your children also.",
    "Forgive your brother Imhotep aught that he has done for the sake of your children.",
    "The Chief Scribe stopped reading.",
    "Mersu nodded approval.",
    "It is wellexpressed.",
    "Nothing I think has been left out.",
    "Imhotep rose.",
    "I thank you Reverend Father.",
    "My offering shall reach you before tomorrows sun sets cattle oil and flax.",
    "Shall we fix the day after that for the ceremony  the placing of the\ninscribed bowl in the offering chamber of the tomb\nMake it three days from now.",
    "The bowl must be inscribed and the preparations made for\nthe necessary rites.",
    "As you will.",
    "I am anxious that no more mischief should befall.",
    "I can well understand your anxiety Imhotep.",
    "But have no fear.",
    "The good spirit Ashayet\nwill surely answer this appeal and her kinsfolk have authority and power and can deal\njustice where it is so richly deserved.",
    "May Isis allow that it be so I thank you Mersu  and for your care and cure of my son\nYahmose.",
    "Come Hori we have much that must be seen to.",
    "Let us return to the house.",
    "Ah this petition does indeed lift a weight off my mind.",
    "The excellent Ashayet will not fail her\ndistracted brother.",
    "II\nWhen Hori entered the courtyard bearing his rolls of papyrus Renisenb was watching for\nhim.",
    "She came running from the lake.",
    "Hori\nYes Renisenb\nWill you come with me to Esa She has been waiting and wants you.",
    "Of course.",
    "Let me just see if Imhotep \nBut Imhotep had been buttonholed by Ipy and father and son were engaged in close\nconversation.",
    "Let me put down these scrolls and these other things and I will come with you Renisenb.",
    "Esa looked pleased when Renisenb and Hori came to her.",
    "Here is Hori Grandmother.",
    "I brought him to you at once.",
    "Good.",
    "Is the air pleasant outside\nI  I think so.",
    "Renisenb was slightly taken aback.",
    "Then give me my stick.",
    "I will walk a little in the courtyard.",
    "Esa seldom left the house and Renisenb was surprised.",
    "She guided the old woman with a\nhand below her elbow.",
    "They went through the central hall and out onto the porch.",
    "Will you sit here Grandmother\nNo child I will walk as far as the lake.",
    "Esas progress was slow but although she limped she was strong on her feet and showed\nno signs of tiredness.",
    "Looking about her she chose a spot where flowers had been planted\nin a little bed near the lake and where a sycamore fig tree gave welcome shade.",
    "Then once established she said with grim satisfaction\nThere Now we can talk and no one can overhear our talk.",
    "You are wise Esa said Hori approvingly.",
    "The things which have to be said must be known only to us three.",
    "I trust you Hori.",
    "You\nhave been with us since you were a little boy.",
    "You have always been faithful and discreet\nand wise.",
    "Renisenb here is the dearest to me of all my sons children.",
    "No harm must come\nto her Hori.",
    "No harm shall come to her Esa.",
    "Hori did not raise his voice but the tone of it and the look in his face as his eyes met the old\nwomans amply satisfied her.",
    "That is well said Hori  quietly and without heat  but as one who means what he says.",
    "Now tell me what has been arranged today\nHori recounted the drawing up of the petition and the gist of it.",
    "Esa listened carefully.",
    "Now listen to me Hori and look at this.",
    "She drew the lion necklace from her dress and\nhanded it to him.",
    "She added Tell him Renisenb where you found this.",
    "Renisenb did so.",
    "Then Esa said Well Hori what do you think\nHori was silent for a moment then he asked You are old and wise Esa.",
    "What do you\nthink\nEsa said You are one of those Hori who do not like to speak rash words unaccompanied\nwith facts.",
    "You knew did you not from the first how Nofret came to her death\nI suspected the truth Esa.",
    "It was only suspicion.",
    "Exactly.",
    "And we have only suspicion now.",
    "Yet here by the lake between us three\nsuspicion can be spoken  and afterward not referred to again.",
    "Now it seems to me that\nthere are three explanations of the tragic things that happened.",
    "The first is that the herd\nboy spoke truth and that what he saw was indeed Nofrets ghost returned from the dead\nand that she had an evil determination to revenge herself still further by causing increased\nsorrow and grief to our family.",
    "That may be so  it is said by priests and others to be\npossible and we do know that illnesses are caused by evil spirits.",
    "But it seems to me who\nam an old woman and who am not inclined to believe all that priests and others say that\nthere are other possibilities.",
    "Such as asked Hori.",
    "Let us admit that Nofret was killed by Satipy that some time afterwards at that same spot\nSatipy had a vision of Nofret and that in her fear and guilt she fell and died.",
    "That is all\nclear enough.",
    "But now let us come to another assumption and that is that after that\nsomeone for a reason we have yet to discover wished to cause the death of two of\nImhoteps sons.",
    "That someone counted on a superstitious dread ascribing the deed to the\nspirit of Nofret  a singularly convenient assumption.",
    "Who would want to kill Yahmose or Sobek cried Renisenb.",
    "Not a servant said Esa they would not dare.",
    "That leaves us with but few people from\nwhom to choose.",
    "One of ourselves But Grandmother that could nor be\nAsk Hori said Esa drily.",
    "You notice he makes no protest.",
    "Renisenb turned to him.",
    "Hori  surely \nHori shook his head gravely.",
    "Renisenb you are young and trusting.",
    "You think that everyone you know and love is just\nas they appear to you.",
    "You do not know the human heart and the bitterness  yes and evil it may contain.",
    "But who  which one \nEsa broke in briskly\nLet us go back to this tale told by the herd boy.",
    "He saw a woman dressed in a dyed linen\ndress wearing Nofrets necklace.",
    "Now if it was no spirit then he saw exactly what he said he\ndid  which means that he saw a woman who was deliberately trying to appear like Nofret.",
    "It might have been Kait  it might have been Henet  it might have been you Renisenb\nFrom that distance it might have been anyone wearing a womans dress and a wig.",
    "Hush let me go on.",
    "The other possibility is that the boy is lying.",
    "He told a tale that he had been\ntaught to tell.",
    "He was obeying someone who had the right to command him and he may\nhave been too dullwitted even to realize the point of the story he was bribed or cajoled to\ntell.",
    "We shall never know now because the boy is dead  in itself a suggestive point.",
    "It\ninclines me to the belief that the boy told a story he had been taught.",
    "Questioned closely as\nhe would have been today that story could have been broken down  it is easy to discover\nwith a little patience whether a child is lying.",
    "So you think we have a poisoner in our midst asked Hori.",
    "I do said Esa.",
    "And you\nI think so too said Hori.",
    "Renisenb glanced from one to the other of them in dismay.",
    "Hori went on\nBut the motive seems to me far from clear.",
    "I agree said Esa.",
    "That is why I am uneasy.",
    "I do not know who is threatened next.",
    "Renisenb broke in But  one of us Her tone was still incredulous.",
    "Esa said sternly Yes Renisenb  one of us.",
    "Henet or Kait or Ipy or Kameni or Imhotep\nhimself  yes or Esa or Hori or even  she smiled  Renisenb.",
    "You are right Esa said Hori.",
    "We must include ourselves.",
    "But why Renisenbs voice held wondering horror.",
    "Why\nIf we knew that wed know very nearly all we wanted to know said Esa.",
    "We can only\ngo by who was attacked.",
    "Sobek remember joined Yahmose unexpectedly after Yahmose\nhad commenced to drink.",
    "Therefore it is certain that whoever did it wanted to kill\nYahmose less certain that that person wished also to kill Sobek.",
    "But who could wish to kill Yahmose Renisenb spoke with skeptical intonation.",
    "Yahmose surely of us all would have no enemies.",
    "He is always quiet and kindly.",
    "Therefore clearly the motive was not one of personal hate said Hori.",
    "As Renisenb\nsays Yahmose is not the kind of man who makes enemies.",
    "No said Esa.",
    "The motive is more obscure than that.",
    "We have here either enmity against\nthe family as a whole or else there lies behind all these things that covetousness against\n\n\fwhich the Maxims of Ptahotep warn us.",
    "It is he says a bundle of every kind of evil and a\nbag of everything that is blameworthy\nI see the direction in which your mind is tending Esa said Hori.",
    "But to arrive at any\nconclusion we shall have to make a forecast of the future.",
    "Esa nodded her head vigorously and her large wig slipped over one ear.",
    "Grotesque though\nthis made her appearance no one was inclined to laugh.",
    "Make such a forecast Hori she said.",
    "Hori was silent for a moment or two his eyes thoughtful.",
    "The two women waited.",
    "Then at\nlast he spoke.",
    "If Yahmose had died as intended then the principal beneficiaries would have been\nImhoteps remaining sons Sobek and Ipy  some part of the estate would doubtless have\nbeen set aside for Yahmoses children but the administration of it would have been in their\nhands  in Sobeks hands in particular.",
    "Sobek would undoubtedly have been the greatest\ngainer.",
    "He would presumably have functioned as kapriest during Imhoteps absences and\nwould succeed to that office after Imhoteps death.",
    "But though Sobek benefited yet Sobek\ncannot be the guilty person since he himself drank of the poisoned wine so heartily that he\ndied.",
    "Therefore as far as I can see the deaths of these two can benefit only one person  at\nthe moment that is  and that person is Ipy.",
    "Agreed said Esa.",
    "But I note Hori that you are farseeing  and I appreciate your\nqualifying phrase.",
    "But let us consider Ipy.",
    "He is young and impatient he has in many ways\na bad disposition he is at the age when the fulfillment of what he desires seems to him the\nmost important thing in life.",
    "He felt anger and resentment against his elder brothers and\nconsidered that he had been unjustly excluded from participation in the family\npartnership.",
    "It seems too that unwise things were said to him by Kameni \nKameni\nIt was Renisenb who interrupted.",
    "Immediately she had done so she flushed and bit her lip.",
    "Hori turned his head to look at her.",
    "The long gentle penetrating look he gave her hurt her\nin some indefinable way.",
    "Esa craned her neck forward and peered at the girl.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "By Kameni.",
    "Whether or not inspired by Henet is another matter.",
    "The\nfact remains that Ipy is ambitious and arrogant was resentful of his brothers superior\nauthority and that he definitely considers himself as he told me long ago the superior\nruling intelligence of the family.",
    "Esas tone was dry.",
    "Hori asked He said that to you\nHe was kind enough to associate me with himself in the possession of a certain amount of\nintelligence.",
    "Renisenb demanded incredulously\nYou think Ipy deliberately poisoned Yahmose and Sobek\nI consider it a possibility no more.",
    "This is suspicion that we talk now  we have not yet\ncome to proof.",
    "Men have killed their brothers since the beginning of time knowing that the\nGods dislike such killing yet driven by the evils of covetousness and hatred.",
    "And if Ipy did\nthis thing we shall not find it easy to get proof of what he did for Ipy I freely admit is\nclever.",
    "Hori nodded.",
    "But as I say it is suspicion we talk here under the sycamore.",
    "And we will go on now to\nconsidering every member of the household in the light of suspicion.",
    "As I say I exclude the\n\n\fservants because I do not believe for one moment that anyone of them would dare do such\na thing.",
    "But I do not exclude Henet.",
    "Henet cried Renisenb.",
    "But Henet is devoted to us all.",
    "She never stops saying so.",
    "It is as easy to utter lies as truth.",
    "I have known Henet for many years.",
    "I knew her when\nshe came here as a young woman with your mother.",
    "She was a relative of hers  poor and\nunfortunate.",
    "Her husband had not cared for her  and indeed Henet was always plain and\nunattractive  and had divorced her.",
    "The one child she bore died in infancy.",
    "She came here\nprofessing herself devoted to your mother but I have seen her eyes watching your mother\nas she moved about the house and courtyard  and I tell you Renisenb there was no love in\nthem.",
    "No sour envy was nearer the mark  and as to her professions of love for you all I\ndistrust them.",
    "Tell me Renisenb said Hori.",
    "Do you yourself feel affection towards Henet\nNno said Renisenb unwillingly.",
    "I cannot.",
    "I have often reproached myself because I\ndislike her.",
    "Dont you think that that is because instinctively you know her words are false Does she\never show her reputed love for you by any real service Has she not always fomented\ndiscord between you all by whispering and repeating things that are likely to wound and\ncause anger\nYes  yes that is true enough.",
    "Esa gave a dry chuckle.",
    "You have both eyes and ears in your head most excellent Hori.",
    "Renisenb argued\nBut my father believes in her and is fond of her.",
    "My son is a fool and always has been said Esa.",
    "All men like flattery  and Henet applies\nflattery as lavishly as unguents are applied at a banquet She may be really devoted to him\n sometimes I think she is  but certainly she is devoted to no one else in this house.",
    "But surely she would not  she would not kill Renisenb protested.",
    "Why should she want\nto poison any of us What good would it do her\nNone.",
    "None.",
    "As to why  I know nothing of what goes on inside Henets head.",
    "What she\nthinks what she feels  that I do not know.",
    "But I sometimes think that strange things are\nbrewing behind that cringing fawning manner.",
    "And if so her reasons are reasons that we\nyou and I and Hori would not understand.",
    "Hori nodded.",
    "There is a rottenness that starts from within.",
    "I spoke to Renisenb once of that.",
    "And I did not understand you said Renisenb.",
    "But I am beginning to understand better\nnow.",
    "It began with the coming of Nofret  I saw then how none of us were quite what I had\nthought them to be.",
    "It made me afraid... And now  she made a helpless gesture with her\nhands  everything is fear...",
    "Fear is only incomplete knowledge said Hori.",
    "When we know Renisenb then there\nwill be no more fear.",
    "And then of course there is Kait proceeded Esa.",
    "Not Kait protested Renisenb.",
    "Kait would not try to kill Sobek.",
    "It is unbelievable.",
    "Nothing is unbelievable said Esa.",
    "That at least I have learned in the course of my life.",
    "Kait is a thoroughly stupid woman and I have always mistrusted stupid women.",
    "They are\ndangerous.",
    "They can see only their own immediate surroundings and only one thing at a\ntime.",
    "Kait lives at the core of a small world which is herself and her children and Sobek as\n\n\fher childrens father.",
    "It might occur to her quite simply that to remove Yahmose would be\nto enrich her children.",
    "Sobek had always been unsatisfactory in Imhoteps eyes  he was\nrash impatient of control and not amenable.",
    "Yahmose was the son on whom Imhotep\nrelied.",
    "But with Yahmose gone Imhotep would have to rely on Sobek.",
    "She would see it I\nthink quite simply like that.",
    "Renisenb shivered.",
    "In spite of herself she recognized a true description of Kaits attitude to\nlife.",
    "Her gentleness her tenderness her quiet loving ways were all directed to her own\nchildren.",
    "Outside herself and her children and Sobek the world did not exist for her.",
    "She\nlooked at it without curiosity and without interest.",
    "Renisenb said slowly But surely she would have realized that it was quite possible for\nSobek to come back as he did thirsty and also drink the wine\nNo said Esa.",
    "I dont think that she would.",
    "Kait as I say is stupid.",
    "She would see only\nwhat she wanted to see  Yahmose drinking and dying and the business being put down to\nthe magical intervention of our evil and beautiful Nofret.",
    "She would see only one simple\nthing  not various possibilities or probabilities and since she did not want Sobek to die it\nwould never occur to her that he might come back unexpectedly.",
    "And now Sobek is dead and Yahmose is living How terrible that must be for her if what\nyou suggest is true.",
    "It is the kind of thing that happens to you when you are stupid said Esa.",
    "Things go\nentirely differently from the way you planned them.",
    "She paused and then went on\nAnd now we come to Kameni.",
    "Kameni Renisenb felt it necessary to say the word quietly and without protest.",
    "Once\nagain she was uncomfortably aware of Horis eyes on her.",
    "Yes we cannot exclude Kameni.",
    "He has no known motive for injuring us  but then what\ndo we really know of him He comes from the north  from the same part of Egypt as\nNofret.",
    "He helped her  willingly or unwillingly who can say  to turn Imhoteps heart\nagainst the children that had been born to him.",
    "I have watched him sometimes and in truth\nI can make little of him.",
    "He seems to me on the whole a commonplace young man with a\ncertain shrewdness of mind and also besides being handsome with a certain something\nthat draws after him the eyes of women.",
    "Yes women will always like Kameni and yet I\nthink  I may be wrong  that he is not one of those who have a real hold on their hearts and\nminds.",
    "He seems always gay and lighthearted and he showed no great concern at the time\nof Nofrets death.",
    "But all this is outward seeming.",
    "Who can tell what goes on in the human heart A\ndetermined man could easily play a part...",
    "Does Kameni in reality passionately resent\nNofrets death and does he seek to exact revenge for it Since Satipy killed Nofret must\nYahmose her husband also die Yes and Sobek too who threatened her  and perhaps\nKait who persecuted her in petty ways and Ipy who also hated her It seems fantastic\nbut who can tell\nEsa paused.",
    "She looked at Hori.",
    "Who can tell Esa\nEsa peered at him shrewdly.",
    "Perhaps you can tell Hori You think you know do you not\nHori was silent for a moment then he said\nI have an idea of my own yes as to who poisoned that wine and why  but it is not as yet\n\n\fvery clear  and indeed I do not see  He paused for a minute frowning then shook his\nhead.",
    "No I could make no definite accusation.",
    "We talk only suspicion here.",
    "Go on Hori speak.",
    "Hori shook his head.",
    "No Esa.",
    "It is only a nebulous thought... And if it were true then it is better for you not to\nknow.",
    "The knowledge might be dangerous.",
    "And the same applies to Renisenb.",
    "Then the knowledge is dangerous to you too Hori\nYes it is dangerous...",
    "I think Esa that we are all in danger  though Renisenb perhaps\nleast.",
    "Esa looked at him for some time without speaking.",
    "I would give a great deal she said at last to know what is in your mind.",
    "Hori did not reply directly.",
    "He said after a moment or two during which he seemed to be\nthinking\nThe only clue to what is in peoples minds is in their behavior.",
    "If a man behaves strangely\noddly is not himself \nThen you suspect him asked Renisenb.",
    "No said Hori.",
    "That is just what I mean.",
    "A man whose mind is evil and whose intentions\nare evil is conscious of that fact and he knows that he must conceal it at all costs.",
    "He dare\nnot therefore afford any unusual behavior...\nA man asked Esa.",
    "Man or woman  it is the same.",
    "I see said Esa.",
    "She threw him a very sharp glance.",
    "Then she said And what of us\nWhat of suspicion where we three are concerned\nThat too must be faced said Hori.",
    "I have been much trusted.",
    "The making of contracts\nand the disposal of crops have been in my hands.",
    "As scribe I have dealt with all the\naccounts.",
    "It could be that I had falsified them  as Kameni discovered had been done in the\nnorth.",
    "Then Yahmose it may be might have been puzzled he might have begun to suspect.",
    "Therefore it would be necessary for me to silence Yahmose.",
    "He smiled faintly at his own\nwords.",
    "Oh Hori said Renisenb how can you say such things No one who knew you would\nbelieve them.",
    "No one Renisenb knows anyone else.",
    "Let me tell you that yet once more.",
    "And I said Esa.",
    "Where does suspicion point in my case Well I am old.",
    "When a brain\ngrows old it turns sick sometimes.",
    "It hates where it used to love.",
    "I may be weary of my\nchildrens children and seek to destroy my own blood.",
    "It is an affliction of an evil spirit that\nhappens sometimes to those who are old.",
    "And I asked Renisenb.",
    "Why should I try to kill my brother whom I love\nHori said\nIf Yahmose and Sobek and Ipy were dead then you would be the last of Imhoteps\nchildren.",
    "He would find you a husband and all here would come to you  and you and your\nhusband would be guardians to Yahmoses and Sobeks children.",
    "Then he smiled.",
    "But under the sycamore tree we do not suspect you Renisenb.",
    "Under the sycamore tree or not under the sycamore tree we love you said Esa.",
    "Chapter 17\n\n\fSECOND MONTH OF SUMMER 1ST DAY\nSo you have been outside the house said Henet bustling in as Esa limped into her room.",
    "A thing you have not done for almost a year\nHer eyes looked inquisitively at Esa.",
    "Old people said Esa have whims.",
    "I saw you sitting by the lake  with Hori and Renisenb.",
    "Pleasant company both of them.",
    "Is there ever anything you do not see Henet\nReally Esa I dont know what you mean You were sitting there plain enough for all the\nworld to see.",
    "But not near enough for all the world to hear\nEsa grinned and Henet bridled angrily.",
    "I dont know why youre so unkind to me Esa Youre always suggesting things.",
    "Im much\ntoo busy seeing that things are done as they should be in this house to listen to other\npeoples conversations.",
    "What do I care what people say\nIve often wondered.",
    "If it were not for Imhotep who does appreciate me \nEsa cut in sharply\nYes if it were not for Imhotep It is on Imhotep you depend is it not If anything were to\nhappen to Imhotep \nIt was Henets turn to interrupt.",
    "Nothing will happen to Imhotep\nHow do you know Henet Is there such safety in this house Something has happened to\nYahmose and Sobek.",
    "That is true  Sobek died  and Yahmose nearly died...\nHenet Esa leaned forward.",
    "Why did you smile when you said that\nI Smile Henet was taken aback.",
    "You are dreaming Esa Is it likely I should smile  at\nsuch a moment  talking of such a terrible thing\nIt is true that I am nearly blind said Esa.",
    "But I am not quite blind.",
    "Sometimes by a\ntrick of light by a screwing up of the eyelids I see very well.",
    "It can happen that if anyone is\ntalking to a person they know cannot see well they are careless.",
    "They permit themselves an\nexpression of face that on other occasions they would not allow.",
    "So I ask you again Why do\nyou smile with such secret satisfaction\nWhat you say is outrageous  quite outrageous\nNow you are frightened.",
    "And who would not be with the things going on in this house cried Henet shrilly.",
    "Were all afraid Im sure with evil spirits returning from the dead to torment us But I\nknow what it is  youve been listening to Hori.",
    "What did he say about me\nWhat does Hori know about you Henet\nNothing  nothing at all.",
    "Youd better ask what do I know about him\nEsas eyes grew sharp.",
    "Well what do you know\nHenet tossed her head.",
    "Ah you all despise poor Henet You think shes ugly and stupid.",
    "But I know whats going\non There are a lot of things I know  indeed theres not much I dont know of what goes on\nin this house.",
    "I may be stupid but I can count how many beans are planted to a row.",
    "Maybe I see more than clever people like Hori do.",
    "When Hori meets me anywhere he has a\ntrick of looking as though I didnt exist as though he saw something behind me something\nthat isnt there.",
    "Hed better look at me thats what I say He may think me negligible and\nstupid  but its not always the clever ones who know everything.",
    "Satipy thought she was\nclever and where is she now I should like to know\nHenet paused triumphantly  then a qualm seemed to pass over her and she visibly cringed\na little glancing nervously at Esa.",
    "But Esa seemed lost in some train of thought of her own.",
    "She had a shocked almost\nfrightened look of bewilderment on her face.",
    "She said slowly and musingly\nSatipy...\nHenet said in her old whining tone\nIm sorry Esa Im sure for losing my temper.",
    "Really I dont know what came over me.",
    "I\ndidnt mean anything of what Ive been saying...",
    "Looking up Esa cut her short.",
    "Go away Henet.",
    "Whether you meant what you said or did not mean what you said does\nnot really matter.",
    "But you have uttered one phrase which has awakened new thoughts in\nmy mind... Go Henet and I warn you.",
    "Be careful of your words and actions.",
    "We want no\nmore deaths in this house.",
    "I hope you understand.",
    "II\nEverything is fear Renisenb had found those words rising to her lips automatically during the consultation by\nthe lake.",
    "It was only afterwards that she began to realize their truth.",
    "She set out mechanically to join Kait and the children where they were clustered by the\nlittle pavilion but found that her footsteps lagged and then ceased as if of their own\nvolition.",
    "She was afraid she found to join Kait to look into that plain and placid face in case she\nmight fancy she saw there the face of a poisoner.",
    "She watched Henet hustle out on the\nporch and back again and her usual sense of repulsion was she found heightened.",
    "Desperately she turned towards the doorway of the courtyard and a moment later\nencountered Ipy striding in his head held high and a gay smile on his impudent face.",
    "Renisenb found herself staring at him.",
    "Ipy the spoiled child of the family the handsome\nwillful little boy she remembered when she had gone away with Khay...\nWhy Renisenb what is it Why are you looking at me so strangely\nWas I\nIpy laughed.",
    "You are looking as halfwitted as Henet.",
    "Renisenb shook her head.",
    "Henet is not halfwitted.",
    "She is very astute.",
    "She has plenty of malice that I know.",
    "In fact shes a nuisance about the house.",
    "I mean to\nget rid of her.",
    "Renisenbs lips opened and closed.",
    "She whispered Get rid of her\nMy dear sister what is the matter with you Have you too been seeing evil spirits like that\nmiserable halfwitted black child\nYou think everyone is halfwitted\n\n\fThat child certainly was.",
    "Well its true Im inclined to be impatient of stupidity.",
    "Ive had\ntoo much of it.",
    "Its no fun I can tell you being plagued with two slowgoing elder brothers\nwho cant see beyond their own noses Now that they are out of the way and there is only\nmy father to deal with you will soon see the difference.",
    "My father will do what I say.",
    "Renisenb looked up at him.",
    "He looked unusually handsome and arrogant.",
    "There was a\nvitality about him a sense of triumphant life and vigor that struck her as above the\nnormal.",
    "Some inner consciousness seemed to be affording him this vital sense of wellbeing.",
    "Renisenb said sharply\nMy brothers are not both out of the way as you put it.",
    "Yahmose is alive.",
    "Ipy looked at her with an air of contemptuous mockery.",
    "And I suppose you think he will get quite well again\nWhy not\nIpy laughed.",
    "Why not Well let us say simply that I disagree with you.",
    "Yahmose is finished done for he may crawl about for a little and sit and moan in the sun.",
    "But he is no longer a man.",
    "He\nhas recovered from the first effects of the poison but you can see yourself he makes no\nfurther headway.",
    "Then why doesnt he Renisenb demanded.",
    "The physician said it would only take a\nlittle time before he was quite strong and himself again.",
    "Ipy shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Physicians do not know everything.",
    "They talk wisely and use long words.",
    "Blame the\nwicked Nofret if you like  but Yahmose your dear brother Yahmose is doomed.",
    "And have you no fear yourself Ipy\nFear I The boy laughed throwing back his handsome head.",
    "Nofret did not love you overwell Ipy.",
    "Nothing can harm me Renisenb unless I choose to let it I am young still but I am one of\nthose people who are born to succeed.",
    "As for you Renisenb you would do well to be on my\nside do you hear You treat me often as an irresponsible boy.",
    "But I am more than that\nnow.",
    "Every month will show a difference.",
    "Soon there will be no will but mine in this place.",
    "My father may give the orders but though his voice speaks them the brain that conceives\nthem will be mine He took a step or two paused and said over his shoulder So be\ncareful Renisenb that I do not become displeased with you.",
    "As Renisenb stood staring after him she heard a footstep and turned to see Kait standing\nbeside her.",
    "What was Ipy saying Renisenb\nRenisenb said slowly\nHe says that he will be master here soon.",
    "Does he said Kait.",
    "I think otherwise.",
    "III\nIpy ran lightly up the steps of the porch and into the house.",
    "The sight of Yahmose lying on\na couch seemed to please him.",
    "He said gaily\nWell how goes it Brother Are we never to see you back on the cultivation I cannot\nunderstand why everything has not gone to pieces without you\nYahmose said fretfully in a weak voice\n\n\fI do not understand it at all.",
    "The poison is now eliminated.",
    "Why do I not regain my\nstrength I tried to walk this morning and my legs would not support me.",
    "I am weak weak  and what is worse I seem to grow weaker every day.",
    "Ipy shook his head with facile commiseration.",
    "That is indeed bad.",
    "And the physicians give no help\nMersus assistant comes every day.",
    "He cannot understand my condition.",
    "I drink strong\ndecoctions of herbs.",
    "The daily incantations are made to the goddess.",
    "Special food full of\nnourishment is prepared for me.",
    "There is no reason so the physician assures me why I\nshould not rapidly grow strong.",
    "Yet instead I seem to waste away.",
    "That is too bad said Ipy.",
    "He went on singing softly under his breath till he came upon his father and Hori engaged\nwith a sheet of accounts.",
    "Imhoteps face anxious and careworn lightened at the sight of his muchloved youngest\nson.",
    "Here is my Ipy.",
    "What have you to report from the estate\nAll goes well Father.",
    "We have been reaping the barley.",
    "A good crop.",
    "Yes thanks to Re all goes well outside.",
    "Would it went as well inside.",
    "Still I must have\nfaith in Ashayet  she will not refuse to aid us in our distress.",
    "I am worried about Yahmose.",
    "I cannot understand this lassitude  this unaccountable weakness.",
    "Ipy smiled scornfully.",
    "Yahmose was always a weakling he said.",
    "That is not so said Hori mildly.",
    "His health has always been good.",
    "Ipy said assertively\nHealth depends upon the spirit of a man.",
    "Yahmose never had any spirit.",
    "He was afraid\neven to give orders.",
    "That is not so lately said Imhotep.",
    "Yahmose has shown himself to be full of authority\nin these last months.",
    "I have been surprised.",
    "But this weakness in the limbs worries me.",
    "Mersu assured me that once the effects of the poison had worn off recovery should be\nswift.",
    "Hori moved some of the papyrus aside.",
    "There are other poisons he said quietly.",
    "What do you mean Imhotep wheeled round.",
    "Hori spoke in a gentle speculative voice.",
    "There are poisons known which do not act at once with violence.",
    "They are insidious.",
    "A\nlittle taken every day accumulates in the system.",
    "Only after long months of weakness does\ndeath come...",
    "There is a knowledge of such things among women  they use them sometimes\nto remove a husband and to make it seem as though his death were natural.",
    "Imhotep grew pale.",
    "Do you suggest that  that  that  is what is the matter with Yahmose\nI am suggesting that it is a possibility.",
    "Though his food is now tasted by a slave before he\ngets it such a precaution means nothing since the amount in any one dish on any one day\nwould cause no ill effect.",
    "Folly cried Ipy loudly.",
    "Absolute folly I do nor believe there are such poisons.",
    "I have\nnever heard of them.",
    "Hori raised his eyes.",
    "You are very young Ipy.",
    "There are still things you do not know.",
    "Imhotep exclaimed But what can we do We have appealed to Ashayet.",
    "We have sent\nofferings to the Temple  not that I have ever had much belief in temples.",
    "It is women who\nare credulous about such things.",
    "What more can be done\nHori said thoughtfully\nLet Yahmoses food be prepared by one trustworthy slave and let that slave be watched\nall the time.",
    "But that means  that here in this house \nRubbish shouted Ipy.",
    "Absolute rubbish.",
    "Hori raised his eyebrows.",
    "Let it be tried he said.",
    "We shall soon see if it is rubbish.",
    "Ipy went angrily out of the room.",
    "Hori stared thoughtfully after him with a perplexed\nfrown on his face.",
    "IV\nIpy went out of the house in such a rage that he almost knocked over Henet.",
    "Get out of my way Henet.",
    "You are always creeping about and getting in the way.",
    "How rough you are Ipy.",
    "You have bruised my arm.",
    "A good thing.",
    "I am tired of you and your sniveling ways.",
    "The sooner you are out of this\nhouse for good the better  and I shall see that you do go.",
    "Henets eyes flashed maliciously.",
    "So you would turn me out would you After all the care and love I have bestowed on you\nall.",
    "Devoted Ive been to the whole family.",
    "Your father knows it well enough.",
    "Hes heard about it enough Im sure And so have we In my opinion youre just an\neviltongued old mischiefmaker.",
    "You helped Nofret with her schemes  that I know well\nenough.",
    "Then she died and you came fawning round us again.",
    "But youll see  in the end my\nfather will listen to me and not to your lying tales.",
    "Youre very angry Ipy.",
    "What has made you angry\nNever mind.",
    "Youre not afraid of something are you Ipy There are odd things going on here.",
    "You cant frighten me you old cat.",
    "He flung himself past her and out of the house.",
    "Henet turned slowly inwards.",
    "A groan from Yahmose attracted her attention.",
    "He had\nraised himself from the couch and was trying to walk.",
    "But his legs failed him almost at once\nand but for Henets rapid assistance he would have fallen to the ground.",
    "There Yahmose there.",
    "Lie back again.",
    "How strong you are Henet.",
    "One would not think it to look at you.",
    "He settled back again\nwith his head on the wooden headrest.",
    "Thank you.",
    "But what is the matter with me Why\nthis feeling as though my muscles were turned to water\nThe matter is that this house is bewitched.",
    "The work of a shedevil who came to us from\nthe north.",
    "No good ever came out of the north.",
    "Yahmose murmured with sudden despondency\nI am dying.",
    "Yes I am dying...\nOthers will die before you said Henet grimly.",
    "What What do you mean He raised himself on an elbow and stared at her.",
    "I know what I am saying.",
    "Henet nodded her head several times.",
    "It is not you who will\n\n\fdie next.",
    "Wait and see.",
    "V\nWhy do you avoid me Renisenb\nKameni planted himself directly in Renisenbs way.",
    "She flushed and found it difficult to\ngive a suitable answer.",
    "It was true that she had deliberately turned aside when she saw\nKameni coming.",
    "Why Renisenb tell me why\nBut she had no answer ready  could only shake her head dumbly.",
    "Then she glanced up at him as he stood facing her.",
    "She had had a faint dread that\nKamenis face too might seem different.",
    "It was with a curious gladness that she saw it\nunchanged his eyes looking at her gravely and for once no smile upon his lips.",
    "Before the look in his eyes her own fell.",
    "Kameni could always disturb her.",
    "His nearness\naffected her physically.",
    "Her heart beat a shade faster.",
    "I know why you avoid me.",
    "Renisenb.",
    "She found her voice.",
    "I  was not avoiding you.",
    "I did not see you coming.",
    "That is a lie.",
    "He was smiling now she could hear it in his voice.",
    "Renisenb beautiful Renisenb.",
    "She felt his warm strong hand round her arm and immediately she shook herself free.",
    "Do not touch me I do not like to be touched.",
    "Why do you fight against me Renisenb You know well enough the thing that is between\nus.",
    "You are young and strong and beautiful.",
    "It is against nature that you should go on\ngrieving for a husband all your life.",
    "I will take you away from this house.",
    "It is full of deaths\nand evil spells.",
    "You shall come away with me and be safe.",
    "And suppose I do not want to come said Renisenb with spirit.",
    "Kameni laughed.",
    "His teeth gleamed white and strong.",
    "But you do want to come only you will not admit it Life is good Renisenb when a sister\nand brother are together.",
    "I will love you and make you happy and you shall be a glorious\nfield to me your lord.",
    "See I shall no longer sing to Ptah Give me my sister tonight but I\nshall go to Imhotep and say Give me my sister Renisenb.",
    "But I think it is not safe for you\nhere so I shall take you away.",
    "I am a good scribe and I can enter the household of one of\nthe great nobles of Thebes if I wish though actually I like the country life here  the\ncultivation and the cattle and the songs of the men who reap and the little pleasure craft on\nthe River.",
    "I would like to sail with you on the River Renisenb.",
    "And we will take Teti with\nus.",
    "She is a beautiful strong child and I will love her and be a good father to her.",
    "Come\nRenisenb what do you say\nRenisenb stood silent.",
    "She was conscious of her heart beating fast and she felt a kind of\nlanguor stealing over her senses.",
    "Yet with this feeling of softness this yielding went\nsomething else  a feeling of antagonism.",
    "The touch of his hand on my arm and I am all weakness... she thought.",
    "Because of his\nstrength... of his square shoulders... his laughing mouth...",
    "But I know nothing of his mind\nof his thoughts of his heart.",
    "There is no peace between us and no sweetness... What do I\nwant I do not know...",
    "But not this... No not this...\nShe heard herself saying and even to her own ears the words sounded weak and uncertain\n\n\fI do not want another husband...",
    "I want to be alone... to be myself...\nNo Renisenb you are wrong.",
    "You were not meant to live alone.",
    "Your hand says so when\nit trembles within mine... See\nWith an effort Renisenb drew her hand away.",
    "I do not love you Kameni.",
    "I think I hate you.",
    "He smiled.",
    "I do not mind your hating me Renisenb.",
    "Your hate is very close to love.",
    "We will speak of\nthis again.",
    "He left her moving with the swiftness and easy gait of a young gazelle.",
    "Renisenb went slowly on to where Kait and the children were playing by the lake.",
    "Kait spoke to her but Renisenb answered at random.",
    "Kait however did not seem to notice or else as usual her mind was too full of the children\nto pay much attention to other things.",
    "Suddenly breaking the silence Renisenb said\nShall I take another husband What do you say Kait\nKait replied placidly without any great interest\nIt would be as well I think.",
    "You are strong and young Renisenb and you can have many\nmore children.",
    "Is that all a womans life Kait To busy myself in the back of the house to have children\nto spend afternoons with them by the lake under the sycamore trees\nIt is all that matters to a woman.",
    "Surely you know that.",
    "Do not speak as though you were\na slave.",
    "Women have power in Egypt  inheritance passes through them to their children.",
    "Women are the life blood of Egypt.",
    "Renisenb looked thoughtfully at Teti who was busily making a garland of flowers for her\ndoll.",
    "Teti was frowning a little with the concentration of what she was doing.",
    "There had\nbeen a time when Teti had looked so like Khay pushing out her underlip turning her head\na little sideways that Renisenbs heart had turned over with pain and love.",
    "But now not\nonly was Khays face dim in Renisenbs memory but Teti no longer had that trick of\nheadturning and pushing out her lip.",
    "There had been other moments when Renisenb had\nheld Teti close to her feeling the child still part of her own body her own living flesh with\na passionate sense of ownership.",
    "She is mine all mine she had said to herself.",
    "Now watching her Renisenb thought She is me  and she is Khay...\nThen Teti looked up and seeing her mother she smiled.",
    "It was a grave friendly smile with\nconfidence in it and pleasure.",
    "Renisenb thought No she is not me and she is not Khay  she is herself.",
    "She is Teti.",
    "She is\nalone as I am alone as we are all alone.",
    "If there is love between us we shall be friends all\nour life  but if there is not love she will grow up and we shall be strangers.",
    "She is Teti and I\nam Renisenb.",
    "Kait was looking at her curiously.",
    "What do you want Renisenb I do not understand.",
    "Renisenb did not answer.",
    "How put into words for Kait the things she hardly understood\nherself She looked round her at the courtyard walls at the gaily colored porch of the\nhouse at the smooth waters of the lake and the graceful little pleasure pavilion the neat\nflower beds and the clumps of papyrus.",
    "All safe shut in nothing to fear with around her\nthe murmur of the familiar home sounds the babble of childrens voices the raucous\nfaroff shrill clamor of women in the house the distant lowing of cattle.",
    "She said slowly\nOne cannot see the River from here.",
    "Kait looked surprised.",
    "Why should one want to see it\nRenisenb said slowly\nI am stupid.",
    "I do not know.",
    "Before her eyes very clearly she saw spread out the panorama of green fields rich and\nlush and beyond far away an enchanted distance of pale rose and amethyst fading into\nthe horizon and cleaving the two the pale silver blue of the Nile...\nShe caught her breath  for with the vision the sights and sounds around her faded  there\ncame instead a stillness a richness an infinite satisfaction... She said to herself If I turn\nmy head I shall see Hori.",
    "He will look up from his papyrus and smile at me...",
    "Presently the\nsun will set and there will be darkness and then I shall sleep... That will be death.",
    "What did you say Renisenb\nRenisenb started.",
    "She was not aware she had spoken aloud.",
    "She came back from her vision\nto reality.",
    "Kait was looking at her curiously.",
    "You said death Renisenb.",
    "What were you thinking\nRenisenb shook her head.",
    "I dont know.",
    "I didnt mean  She looked round her again.",
    "How pleasant it was this\nfamily scene with the splashing water and the children at play.",
    "She drew a deep breath.",
    "How peaceful it is here.",
    "One cant imagine anything  horrible  happening here.",
    "But it was by the lake that they found Ipy the next morning.",
    "He was sprawled face\ndownwards with his face in the water where a hand had held him while he drowned.",
    "Chapter 18\nSECOND MONTH OF SUMMER 10TH DAY\nImhotep sat huddled down upon himself.",
    "He looked very much older a broken shrunken\nold man.",
    "On his face was a piteous look of bewilderment.",
    "Henet brought him food and coaxed him to take it.",
    "Yes yes Imhotep you must keep up your strength.",
    "Why should I What is strength Ipy was strong  strong in youth and beauty  and now\nhe lies in the brine bath... My son my dearly loved son.",
    "The last of my sons.",
    "No no Imhotep  you have Yahmose your good Yahmose.",
    "For how long No he too is doomed.",
    "We are all doomed.",
    "What evil is this that has come\nupon us Could I know that such things would come of taking a concubine into my house\nIt is an accepted thing to do  it is righteous and according to the law of men and Gods.",
    "I\ntreated her with honor.",
    "Why then should these things come upon me Or is it Ashayet\nwho wreaks vengeance upon me Is it she who will not forgive Certainly she has made no\nanswer to my petition.",
    "The evil business still goes on.",
    "No no Imhotep.",
    "You must not say that.",
    "So short a time has passed since the bowl was\nplaced in the offeringchamber.",
    "Does one not know how long affairs of law and justice take\nin this world  how endless are the delays in the Nomarchs court  and still more when a\ncase goes up to the Vizier Justice is justice in this world and the next a business that\nmoves slowly but is adjusted with righteousness in the end.",
    "Imhotep shook his head doubtfully.",
    "Henet went on\n\n\fBesides Imhotep you must remember that Ipy was not Ashayets son  he was born to\nyour sister Ipi.",
    "Why then should Ashayet concern herself violently on his behalf But with\nYahmose it will be different  Yahmose will recover because Ashayet will see to it that he\ndoes.",
    "I must admit Henet that your words comfort me...",
    "There is much in what you say.",
    "Yahmose it is true recovers strength now every day.",
    "He is a good loyal son  but oh for\nmy Ipy  such spirit  such beauty Imhotep groaned anew.",
    "Alas Alas Henet wailed in sympathy.",
    "That accursed girl and her beauty Would I had never set eyes on her.",
    "Yes indeed dear master.",
    "A daughter of Set if I ever saw one.",
    "Learned in magic and evil\nspells there can be no doubt about it.",
    "There was the tap of a stick on the floor and Esa came limping into the hall.",
    "She gave a\nderisive snort.",
    "Has no one in this house any sense Have you nothing better to do than bleat out curses\nagainst an unfortunate girl who took your fancy and who indulged in a little feminine spite\nand malice goaded by the stupid behavior of the stupid wives of your stupid sons\nA little spite and malice  is that what you call it Esa When of my three sons two are\ndead and one is dying Oh that my mother should say such things to me\nIt seems necessary that someone should say them since you cannot recognize facts for\nwhat they are.",
    "Wipe out of your mind this silly superstitious belief that a dead girls spirit\nis working this evil.",
    "It was a live hand that held Ipys head down in the lake to drown and\na live hand that dropped poison into the wine that Yahmose and Sobek drank.",
    "You have an\nenemy yes Imhotep but an enemy here in this house.",
    "And the proof is that since Horis\nadvice was taken and Renisenb herself prepares Yahmoses food or a slave prepares it\nwhile she watches and that her hand carries it to him since then I say Yahmose has\ngained health and strength every day.",
    "Try to stop being a fool Imhotep and moaning and\nbeating your head  in all of which Henet is being extremely helpful \nOh Esa how you misjudge me\nIn which I say Henet assists you  either because she is a fool too or for some other\nreason \nMay Re forgive you Esa for your unkindness to a poor lonely woman\nEsa swept on shaking her stick in an impressive gesture.",
    "Pull yourself together Imhotep and think.",
    "Your dead wife Ashayet who was a very\nlovely woman and not a fool by the way may exert her influence for you in the other world\nbut can hardly be expected to do your thinking for you in this one We have got to act\nImhotep for if we do not then there will be more deaths.",
    "A live enemy An enemy in this house You really believe that Esa\nOf course I believe it because it is the only thing that makes sense.",
    "But then we are all in danger\nCertainly we are.",
    "In danger not of spells and spirit hands but of human agency  of live\nfingers that drop poison.",
    "In food and drink of a human figure that steals up behind a boy\nwho returns late at night from the village and forces his head down into the waters of the\nlake\nImhotep said thoughtfully Strength would be needed for that.",
    "On the face of it yes but I am not sure.",
    "Ipy had drunk much beer in the village.",
    "He was in\na wild and boastful mood.",
    "It may be that he returned home unsteady on his feet and that\n\n\fhaving no fear of the person who accosted him he bent of his own accord to bathe his face\nin the lake.",
    "Little strength would be needed then.",
    "What are you trying to say Esa That a woman did this thing But it is impossible  the\nwhole thing is impossible  there can be no enemy in this house or we should know it.",
    "I\nshould know it\nThere is an evil of the heart Imhotep that does nor show in the face.",
    "You mean that one of our servants or a slave \nNo servant and no slave Imhotep.",
    "One of ourselves Or else  do you mean Hori or Kameni But Hori is one of the family.",
    "He has proved himself faithful and trustworthy.",
    "And Kameni  he is a stranger true but he\nis of our blood and he has proved his devotion by his zeal in my service.",
    "Moreover he came\nto me only this morning and urged that I should consent to his marriage with Renisenb.",
    "Oh he did did he Esa showed interest.",
    "And what did you say\nWhat could I say Imhotep was fretful.",
    "Is this a time to talk of marriage I said as\nmuch to him.",
    "And what did he say to that\nHe said that in his opinion this was the time to talk of marriage.",
    "He said that Renisenb\nwas not safe in this house.",
    "I wonder said Esa.",
    "I very much wonder... Is she I thought she was  and Hori thought\nso  but now...\nImhotep went on.",
    "Can one have marriages and funeral ceremonies going on side by side It is not decent.",
    "The whole Nile would talk about it.",
    "This is no time for convention said Esa.",
    "Especially since it would seem that the\nembalmers men are with us permanently.",
    "All this must be a blessing to Ipi and Montu the firm must be doing exceptionally well.",
    "They have put their charges up by ten per cent Imhotep was momentarily diverted.",
    "Iniquitous They say that labor is more expensive.",
    "They should give us a cutrate price for quantity Esa smiled grimly at her joke.",
    "My dear mother.",
    "Imhotep looked at her in horror.",
    "This is not a jest.",
    "All life is a jest Imhotep  and it is death who laughs last.",
    "Do you not hear it at every\nfeast Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow you die Well that is very true for us here it is a question only of whose death will come tomorrow.",
    "What you say is terrible  terrible What can be done\nTrust no one said Esa.",
    "That is the first the most vital thing.",
    "She repeated with\nemphasis Trust no one.",
    "Henet began to sob.",
    "Why do you look at me... Im sure if anyone is worthy of trust I am.",
    "Ive proved it over\nall these years.",
    "Dont listen to her Imhotep.",
    "There there my good Henet  naturally I trust you.",
    "I know only too well your true and\ndevoted heart.",
    "You know nothing said Esa.",
    "None of us know anything.",
    "That is our danger.",
    "You accused me whined Henet.",
    "I cannot accuse.",
    "I have neither knowledge nor proof  only suspicion.",
    "Imhotep looked up sharply.",
    "You have suspicion  of whom\n\n\fEsa said slowly I have suspected once  and twice  and a third time.",
    "I will be honest.",
    "I\nsuspected first Ipy  but Ipy is dead so that suspicion was false.",
    "Then I suspected another\nperson  but on the very day of Ipys death yet a third idea came to me...\nShe paused.",
    "Are Hori and Kameni in the house Send for them here  yes and Renisenb too from the\nkitchen.",
    "And Kait and Yahmose.",
    "I have something to say and all the house should hear it.",
    "II\nEsa looked round at the assembled family.",
    "She met Yahmoses grave and gentle glance\nKamenis ready smile the frightened enquiry in Renisenbs eyes the placid incurious\nglance of Kait the quiet inscrutability of Horis thoughtful gaze the irritable fear in\nImhoteps twitching face and the avid curiosity and  yes  pleasure in Henets eyes.",
    "She thought Their faces tell me nothing.",
    "They show only the outward emotion.",
    "Yet\nsurely if I am right there must be some betrayal.",
    "Aloud she said\nI have something to say to you all  but first I will speak only to Henet  here in front of all\nof you.",
    "Henets expression changed  the avidity and the pleasure went out of it.",
    "She looked\nfrightened.",
    "Her voice rose in a shrill protest.",
    "You suspect me Esa.",
    "I knew it You will make a case against me and how am I a poor\nwoman with no great wits to defend myself I shall be condemned  condemned unheard.",
    "Not unheard said Esa with irony and saw Hori smile.",
    "Henet went on her voice growing more and more hysterical\nI have done nothing...",
    "I am innocent... Imhotep my dearest master save me... She flung\nherself down and clasped him round the knees.",
    "Imhotep began to splutter indignantly\nmeanwhile patting Henets head.",
    "Really Esa I protest  This is disgraceful...\nEsa cut him short.",
    "I have made no accusation.",
    "I do not accuse without proof.",
    "I ask only that Henet shall\nexplain to us here the meaning of certain things she has said.",
    "I have said nothing  nothing at all...\nOh yes you have said Esa.",
    "These are words I heard with my own ears  and my ears\nare sharp even if my eyes are dim.",
    "You said that you knew something about Hori.",
    "Now\nwhat is it that you know about Hori\nHori looked slightly surprised.",
    "Yes Henet he said.",
    "What do you know about me Let us have it.",
    "Henet sat back on her haunches and wiped her eyes.",
    "She looked sullen and defiant.",
    "I know nothing she said.",
    "What should I know\nThat is what we are waiting for you to tell us said Hori.",
    "Henet shrugged her shoulders.",
    "I was just talking.",
    "I meant nothing.",
    "Esa said\nI will repeat to you your own words.",
    "You said that we all despised you but that you knew\na lot of what was going on in this house  and that you saw more than many clever people\nsaw.",
    "And then you said this  that when Hori met you he looked at you as though you didnt\nexist as though he saw something behind you  something that wasnt there.",
    "He always looks like that said Henet sullenly.",
    "I might be an insect the way he looks at\nme  something that practically doesnt matter.",
    "Esa said slowly\nThat phrase has remained in my mind  something behind  something  that wasnt there.",
    "Henet said He should have looked at me.",
    "And she went on to speak of Satipy  yes of\nSatipy  and of how Satipy was clever but where was Satipy now...\nEsa looked around.",
    "Does that mean nothing to any of you Think of Satipy  Satipy who is dead... And\nremember one should look at a person  not at something that isnt there...",
    "There was a moments dead silence and then Henet screamed.",
    "It was a high thin scream  a\nscream it would seem of sheer terror.",
    "She cried out incoherently\nI didnt  save me  master.",
    "Dont let her... Ive said nothing  nothing.",
    "Imhoteps pentup rage burst out.",
    "This is unpardonable he roared.",
    "I will not have this poor woman terrified and accused.",
    "What have you against her By your own words nothing at all.",
    "Yahmose joined in without his usual timidity\nMy father is right.",
    "If you have a definite accusation to bring against Henet bring it.",
    "I do not accuse her said Esa slowly.",
    "She leaned on her stick.",
    "Her figure seemed to have shrunk.",
    "She spoke slowly and heavily.",
    "Yahmose turned with authority to Henet.",
    "Esa is not accusing you of causing the evils that have happened but if I understand her\nrightly she thinks that you have certain knowledge which you are withholding.",
    "Therefore\nHenet if there is anything you know about Hori or another now is the time to speak.",
    "Here\nbefore us all.",
    "Speak.",
    "What knowledge have you\nHenet shook her head.",
    "None.",
    "Be very sure of what you are saying Henet.",
    "Knowledge is dangerous.",
    "I know nothing.",
    "I swear it.",
    "I swear it by the Nine Gods of the Ennead by the Goddess\nMaat by Re himself.",
    "Henet was trembling.",
    "Her voice had none of its usual whining affected quality.",
    "It sounded\nawed and sincere.",
    "Esa gave a deep sigh.",
    "Her figure bent forward.",
    "She murmured\nHelp me back to my room.",
    "Hori and Renisenb came quickly to her.",
    "Esa said\nNot you Renisenb.",
    "I will have Hori.",
    "She leaned on him as he helped her from the room towards her own quarters.",
    "Glancing up\nat him she saw his face was stern and unhappy.",
    "She murmured\nWell Hori\nYou have been unwise Esa very unwise.",
    "I had to know.",
    "Yes  but you have taken a terrible risk.",
    "I see.",
    "So you too think the same\n\n\fI have thought so for some time but there is no proof  no shadow of proof.",
    "And even\nnow Esa you have no proof.",
    "It is all in your mind.",
    "It is enough that I know.",
    "It may be too much.",
    "What do you mean Oh yes of course.",
    "Guard yourself Esa.",
    "From now on you are in danger.",
    "We must try to act quickly.",
    "That yes.",
    "But what can we do There must be proof.",
    "I know.",
    "They could say no more.",
    "Esas little maid came running to her mistress.",
    "Hori relinquished\nher to the girls care and turned away.",
    "His face was grave and perplexed.",
    "The little maid chartered and fussed around Esa but Esa hardly noticed her.",
    "She felt old\nand ill and cold... Once again she saw that intent circle of faces watching her as she spoke.",
    "Only a look  a momentary flash of fear and understanding.",
    "Could she have been wrong\nWas she so sure of what she had seen After all her eyes were dim...",
    "Yes she was sure.",
    "It was less an expression than the sudden tension of a whole body  a\nhardening  a rigidity.",
    "To one person and one person only her rambling words had made\nsense  that deadly unerring sense which is truth...\nChapter 19\nSECOND MONTH OF SUMMER 15TH DAY\nNow that the matter is laid before you Renisenb what have you to say\nRenisenb looked doubtfully from her father to Yahmose.",
    "Her head felt dull and bemused.",
    "I do not know.",
    "The words fell from her lips tonelessly.",
    "Under ordinary conditions went on Imhotep there would be plenty of time for\ndiscussion.",
    "I have other kinsmen and we could select and reject until we settled upon the\nmost suitable as a husband for you.",
    "But as it is life is uncertain  yes life is uncertain.",
    "His voice faltered.",
    "He went on\nThat is how the matter stands Renisenb.",
    "Death is facing all three of us today.",
    "Yahmose\nyourself myself.",
    "At which of us will the peril strike next Therefore it behoves me to put\nmy affairs in order.",
    "If anything should happen to Yahmose you my only daughter will\nneed a man to stand by your side and share your inheritance and perform such duties of\nmy estate as cannot be administered by a woman.",
    "For who knows at what moment I may\nbe taken from you The trusteeship and guardianship of Sobeks children I have arranged\nin my will shall be administered by Hori if Yahmose is no longer alive  also the\nguardianship of Yahmoses children  since that is his wish  eh Yahmose\nYahmose nodded.",
    "Hori has always been very close to me.",
    "He is as one of my own family.",
    "Quite quite said Imhotep.",
    "But the fact remains he is not of the family.",
    "Now Kameni is.",
    "Therefore all things considered he is the best husband available at the moment for\nRenisenb.",
    "So what do you say Renisenb\nI do not know Renisenb repeated again.",
    "She felt a terrible lassitude.",
    "He is handsome and pleasing you will agree\nOh yes.",
    "But you do not want to marry him Yahmose asked gently.",
    "Renisenb threw her brother a grateful glance.",
    "He was so resolved that she should not be\nhurried or badgered into doing what she did not want to do.",
    "I really do not know what I want to do.",
    "She hurried on It is stupid I know but I am\nstupid today.",
    "It is  it is the strain under which we are living.",
    "With Kameni at your side you will feel protected said Imhotep.",
    "Yahmose asked his father\nHave you considered Hori as a possible husband for Renisenb\nWell yes it is a possibility...\nHis wife died when he was still a young man.",
    "Renisenb knows him well and likes him.",
    "Renisenb sat in a dream while the two men talked.",
    "This was her marriage they were\ndiscussing and Yahmose was trying to help her to choose what she herself wanted but she\nfelt as lifeless as Tetis wooden doll.",
    "Presently she said abruptly interrupting their speech without even hearing what they were\nsaying\nI will marry Kameni since you think it is a good thing.",
    "Imhotep gave an exclamation of\nsatisfaction and hurried out of the hall.",
    "Yahmose came over to his sister.",
    "He laid a hand on\nher shoulder.",
    "Do you want this marriage Renisenb Will you be happy\nWhy should I not be happy Kameni is handsome and gay and kind.",
    "I know.",
    "Yahmose still looked dissatisfied and doubtful.",
    "But your happiness is\nimportant Renisenb.",
    "You must not let my father rush you into something you do not want.",
    "You know how he is.",
    "Oh yes yes when he gets an idea into his head we all have to give way to it.",
    "Not necessarily.",
    "Yahmose spoke with firmness.",
    "I will not give way here unless you wish\nit.",
    "Oh Yahmose you never stand out against our father.",
    "But I will in this case.",
    "He cannot force me to agree with him and I shall not do so.",
    "Renisenb looked up at him.",
    "How resolute and determined his usually undecided face was\nlooking\nYou are good to me Yahmose she said gratefully.",
    "But indeed I am not yielding to\ncompulsion.",
    "The old life here the life I was so pleased to come back to has passed away.",
    "Kameni and I will make a new life together and live as a good brother and sister should.",
    "If you are sure \nI am sure said Renisenb and smiling at him affectionately she went out of the hall onto\nthe porch.",
    "From there she crossed the courtyard.",
    "By the edge of the lake Kameni was playing with\nTeti.",
    "Renisenb drew near very quietly and watched them while they were still unaware of\nher approach.",
    "Kameni merry as ever seemed to be enjoying the game as much as the child\ndid.",
    "Renisenbs heart warmed to him.",
    "She thought He will make a good father to Teti.",
    "Then Kameni turned his head and saw her and stood upright with a laugh.",
    "We have made Tetis doll a kapriest he said.",
    "And he is making the offerings and\nattending to the ceremonies at the Tomb.",
    "His name is Meriptah said Teti.",
    "She was very serious.",
    "He has two children and a scribe\n\n\flike Hori.",
    "Kameni laughed.",
    "Teti is very intelligent he said.",
    "And she is strong and beautiful too\nHis eyes went from the child to Renisenb and in their caressing glance Renisenb read the\nthought in his mind  of the children that she would one day bear him.",
    "It sent a slight thrill through her  yet at the same time a sudden piercing regret.",
    "She would\nhave liked in that moment to have seen in his eyes only her own image.",
    "She thought Why\ncannot it be only Renisenb he sees\nThen the feeling passed and she smiled at him gently.",
    "My father has spoken to me she said.",
    "And you consent\nShe hesitated a moment before she answered\nI consent.",
    "The final word was spoken that was the end.",
    "It was all settled.",
    "She wished she did not feel\nso tired and numb.",
    "Renisenb\nYes Kameni.",
    "Will you sail with me on the River in a pleasure boat That is a thing I have always\nwanted to do with you.",
    "Odd that he should say that.",
    "The very first moment she had seen him she had thought of a\nsquare sail and the River and Khays laughing face.",
    "And now she had forgotten Khays\nface and in the place of it against the sail and the River it would be Kameni who sat and\nlaughed into her eyes.",
    "That was death.",
    "That was what death did to you.",
    "I felt this you said.",
    "I felt that  but\nyou only said it you did not now feel anything.",
    "The dead were dead.",
    "There was no such\nthing as remembrance...",
    "Yes but there was Teti.",
    "There were life and the renewing of life as the waters of the yearly\ninundation swept away the old and prepared the soil for the new crops.",
    "What had Kait said The women of the household must stand together What was she\nafter all but a woman of a household  whether Renisenb or another what matter...\nThen she heard Kamenis voice  urgent a little troubled.",
    "What are you thinking Renisenb You go so far away sometimes... Will you come with\nme on the River\nYes Kameni I will come with you.",
    "We will take Teti too.",
    "II\nIt was like a dream Renisenb thought  the boat and the sail and Kameni and herself and\nTeti.",
    "They had escaped from death and the fear of death.",
    "This was the beginning of new\nlife.",
    "Kameni spoke and she answered as though in a trance...",
    "This is my life she thought there is no escape...\nThen perplexed But why do I say to myself escape What place is there to which I\ncould fly\nAnd again there rose before her eyes the little rock chamber beside the Tomb and herself\n\n\fsitting there with one knee drawn up and her chin resting on her hand...\nShe thought But that was something outside life.",
    "This is life  and there is no escape now\nuntil death...\nKameni moored the boat and she stepped ashore.",
    "He lifted Teti out.",
    "The child clung to him\nand her hand at his neck broke the string of an amulet he wore.",
    "It fell at Renisenbs feet.",
    "She picked it up.",
    "It was an Ankh sign of electrum and gold.",
    "She gave a little regretful cry.",
    "It is bent.",
    "I am sorry.",
    "Be careful  as Kameni took it from her  it may break.",
    "But his strong fingers bending it still further snapped it deliberately in two.",
    "Oh what have you done\nTake half Renisenb and I will take the other.",
    "It shall be a sign between us  that we are\nhalves of the same whole.",
    "He held it out to her and just as she stretched out her hand to take it something clicked in\nher brain and she drew in her breath sharply.",
    "What is it Renisenb\nNofret.",
    "What do you mean  Nofret\nRenisenb spoke with swift certainty.",
    "The broken amulet in Nofrets jewel box.",
    "It was you who gave it to her... You and Nofret...",
    "I see everything now.",
    "Why she was so unhappy.",
    "And I know who put the jewel box in my\nroom.",
    "I know everything... Do not lie to me Kameni.",
    "I tell you I know.",
    "Kameni made no protest.",
    "He stood looking at her steadily and his gaze did not falter.",
    "When\nhe spoke his voice was grave and for once there was no smile on his face.",
    "I shall not lie to you Renisenb.",
    "He waited a moment frowning a little as though trying to arrange his thoughts.",
    "In a way Renisenb I am glad that you do know  though it is not quite as you think.",
    "You gave the broken amulet to her  as you would have given it to me  as a sign that you\nwere halves of the same whole.",
    "Those were your words.",
    "You are angry Renisenb.",
    "I am glad because that shows that you love me.",
    "But all the same\nI must make you understand.",
    "I did not give the amulet to Nofret.",
    "She gave it to me...",
    "He paused.",
    "Perhaps you do not believe me but it is true.",
    "I swear that it is true.",
    "Renisenb said slowly\nI will not say that I do not believe you... That may very well be true.",
    "Nofrets dark unhappy face rose up before her eyes.",
    "Kameni was going on eagerly boyishly...",
    "Try to understand Renisenb.",
    "Nofret was very beautiful.",
    "I was flattered and pleased.",
    "Who\nwould not be But I never really loved her \nRenisenb felt an odd pang of pity.",
    "No Kameni had not loved Nofret  but Nofret had loved\nKameni  had loved him despairingly and bitterly.",
    "It was at just this spot on the Nile bank\nthat she had spoken to Nofret that morning offering her friendship and affection.",
    "She\nremembered only too well the dark tide of hate and misery that had emanated from the girl\nthen.",
    "The cause of it was clear enough now.",
    "Poor Nofret  the concubine of a fussy elderly\nman  eating her heart out for love of a gay careless handsome young man who had cared\nlittle or nothing for her.",
    "Kameni was going on eagerly\n\n\fDo you not understand Renisenb that as soon as I came here I saw you and loved you\nThat from that moment I thought of no one else Nofret saw it plainly enough.",
    "Yes Renisenb thought Nofret had seen it.",
    "Nofret had hated her from that moment  and\nRenisenb did not feel inclined to blame her.",
    "I did not even want to write the letter to your father.",
    "I did not want to have anything to do\nwith Nofrets schemes any more.",
    "But it was difficult  you must try to realize that it was\ndifficult.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "Renisenb spoke impatiently.",
    "All that does not matter.",
    "It is only Nofret that\nmatters.",
    "She was very unhappy.",
    "She loved you I think very much.",
    "Well I did not love her.",
    "Kameni spoke impatiently.",
    "You are cruel said Renisenb.",
    "No I am a man that is all.",
    "If a woman chooses to make herself miserable about me it\nannoys me that is the simple truth.",
    "I did not want Nofret.",
    "I wanted you.",
    "Oh Renisenb you\ncannot be angry with me for that\nIn spite of herself she smiled.",
    "Do not let Nofret who is dead make trouble between us who are living.",
    "I love you\nRenisenb and you love me and that is all that matters.",
    "Yes Renisenb thought that is all that matters...\nShe looked at Kameni who stood with his head a little on one side a pleading expression on\nhis gay confident face.",
    "He looked very young.",
    "Renisenb thought He is right.",
    "Nofret is dead and we are alive.",
    "I understand her hatred of\nme now  and I am sorry that she suffered  but it was not my fault.",
    "And it was not\nKamenis fault that he loved me and not her.",
    "These things happen.",
    "Teti who had been playing on the riverbank came up and pulled at her mothers hand.",
    "Shall we go home now Mother  shall we go home\nRenisenb gave a deep sigh.",
    "Yes she said we will go home.",
    "They walked towards the house Teti running a little way in front of them.",
    "Kameni gave a sigh of satisfaction.",
    "You are generous Renisenb as well as lovely.",
    "All is the same as it was between us\nYes Kameni.",
    "All is the same.",
    "He lowered his voice.",
    "Out there on the River  I was very happy.",
    "Were you happy too Renisenb\nYes I was happy.",
    "You looked happy.",
    "But you looked as though you were thinking of something very far\naway.",
    "I want you to think of me.",
    "I was thinking of you.",
    "He took her hand and she did not draw it away.",
    "He sang very softly under his breath\nMy sister is like the persea tree...",
    "He felt her hand tremble in his and heard the quickened pace of her breathing and was\nsatisfied at last...\nIII\nRenisenb called Henet to her room.",
    "Henet hurrying in came to an abrupt stop as she saw Renisenb standing by the open jewel\n\n\fbox with the broken amulet in her hand.",
    "Renisenbs face was stern and angry.",
    "You put this jewel box in my room didnt you Henet You wanted me to find that\namulet.",
    "You wanted me one day \nTo find out who had the other half I see you have found out.",
    "Well its always as well to\nknow isnt it Renisenb\nHenet laughed spitefully.",
    "You wanted the knowledge to hurt me said Renisenb her anger still at white heat.",
    "You\nlike hurting people dont you Henet You never say anything straight out.",
    "You wait and\nwait  until the best moment comes.",
    "You hate us all dont you You always have.",
    "The things youre saying Renisenb Im sure you dont mean them\nBut there was no whine in Henets voice now only a sly triumph.",
    "You wanted to make trouble between me and Kameni.",
    "Well there is no trouble.",
    "Thats very nice and forgiving of you Im sure Renisenb.",
    "Youre quite different from\nNofret arent you\nDo not let us talk of Nofret.",
    "No better not perhaps.",
    "Kamenis lucky as well as being goodlooking isnt he It was\nlucky for him I mean that Nofret died when she did.",
    "She could have made a lot of trouble\nfor him  with your father.",
    "She wouldnt have liked his marrying you  no she wouldnt\nhave liked it at all.",
    "In fact I think she would have found some way of stopping it.",
    "Im quite\nsure she would.",
    "Renisenb looked at her with cold dislike.",
    "There is always poison in your tongue Henet.",
    "It stings like a scorpion.",
    "But you cannot\nmake me unhappy.",
    "Well thats splendid isnt it You must be very much in love.",
    "Oh hes a handsome young\nman is Kameni  and he knows how to sing a very pretty love song.",
    "Hell always get what he\nwants never fear.",
    "I admire him I really do.",
    "He always seems so simple and\nstraightforward.",
    "What are you trying to say Henet\nIm just telling you that I admire Kameni.",
    "And Im quite sure that he is simple and\nstraightforward.",
    "Its not put on.",
    "The whole thing is quite like one of those tales the\nstorytellers in the bazaars recite.",
    "The poor young scribe marrying the masters daughter\nand sharing the inheritance with her and living happily ever afterwards.",
    "Wonderful what\ngood luck a handsome young man always has.",
    "I am right said Renisenb.",
    "You do hate us.",
    "Now how can you say that Renisenb when you know how Ive slaved for you all ever\nsince your mother died\nBut there was still the evil triumph in Henets voice rather than the customary whine.",
    "Renisenb looked down again at the jewel box and suddenly another certainty came into her\nmind.",
    "It was you who put the gold lion necklace in this box.",
    "Dont deny it Henet.",
    "I know I tell\nyou.",
    "Henets sly triumph died.",
    "She looked suddenly frightened.",
    "I couldnt help it Renisenb.",
    "I was afraid...\nWhat do you mean  afraid\nHenet came a step nearer and lowered her voice.",
    "She gave it me  Nofret I mean.",
    "Oh some time before she died.",
    "She gave me one or two\n\n\fpresents.",
    "Nofret was generous you know.",
    "Oh yes she was generous.",
    "I dare say she paid you well.",
    "Thats not a nice way of putting it Renisenb.",
    "But Im telling you all about it.",
    "She gave me\nthe gold lion necklace and an amethyst clasp and one or two other things.",
    "And then when\nthat boy came out with his story of having seen a woman with that necklace on  well I was\nafraid.",
    "I thought maybe theyd think that it was I who poisoned Yahmoses wine.",
    "So I put\nthe necklace in the box.",
    "Is that the truth Henet Do you ever speak the truth\nI swear its the truth Renisenb.",
    "I was afraid...\nRenisenb looked at her curiously.",
    "Youre shaking Henet.",
    "You look as though you were afraid now.",
    "Yes I am afraid... Ive reason to be.",
    "Why Tell me.",
    "Henet licked her thin lips.",
    "She glanced sideways behind her.",
    "Her eyes came back like a\nhunted animals.",
    "Tell me said Renisenb.",
    "Henet shook her head.",
    "She said in an uncertain voice\nTheres nothing to tell.",
    "You know too much Henet.",
    "Youve always known too much.",
    "Youve enjoyed it but now\nits dangerous.",
    "Thats it isnt it\nHenet shook her head again.",
    "Then she laughed maliciously.",
    "You wait Renisenb.",
    "One day I shall hold the whip in this house  and crack it.",
    "Wait and\nsee.",
    "Renisenb drew herself up.",
    "You will not harm me Henet.",
    "My mother will not let you harm me.",
    "Henets face changed  the eyes burned.",
    "I hated your mother she said.",
    "I always hated her... And you who have her eyes  and\nher voice  her beauty and her arrogance  I hate you Renisenb.",
    "Renisenb laughed.",
    "And at last  Ive made you say it\nChapter 20\nSECOND MONTH OF SUMMER 15TH DAY\nOld Esa limped wearily into her room.",
    "She was perplexed and very weary.",
    "Age she realized was at last taking toll of her.",
    "So far\nshe had acknowledged her weariness of body but had been conscious of no weariness of\nmind.",
    "But now she had to admit that the strain of remaining mentally alert was taxing her\nbodily resources.",
    "If she knew now as she believed she did from what quarter danger impended  Yet that\nknowledge permitted of no mental relaxation.",
    "Instead she had to be more than ever on her\nguard since she had deliberately drawn attention to herself.",
    "Proof  proof  she must get\nproof.",
    "But how\nIt was there she realized that her age told against her.",
    "She was too tired to improvise  to\nmake the mental creative effort.",
    "All she was capable of was defense  to remain alert\nwatchful guarding herself.",
    "For the killer  she had no illusions about that  would be quite ready to kill again.",
    "Well she had no intention of being the next victim.",
    "Poison she felt sure was the vehicle\nthat would be employed.",
    "Violence was not conceivable since she was never alone but was\nalways surrounded by servants.",
    "So it would be poison.",
    "Well she could counter that.",
    "Renisenb should cook her food and bring it to her.",
    "She had a wine stand and jar brought to\nher room and after a slave had tasted it she waited twentyfour hours to make sure that\nno evil results followed.",
    "She made Renisenb share her food and her wine  although she had\nno fear for Renisenb  yet.",
    "It might be that there was no fear for Renisenb  ever.",
    "But of\nthat one could not be sure.",
    "Between whiles she sat motionless driving her weary brain to devise means of proving the\ntruth or watching her little maid starching and pleating her linen dresses or restringing\nnecklaces and bracelets.",
    "This evening she was very weary.",
    "She had joined Imhotep at his request to discuss the\nquestion of Renisenbs marriage before he himself spoke to his daughter.",
    "Imhotep shrunken and fretful was a shadow of his former self.",
    "His manner had lost its\npomposity and assurance.",
    "He leaned now on his mothers indomitable will and\ndetermination.",
    "As for Esa she had been fearful  very fearful  of saying the wrong thing.",
    "Lives might hang\non an injudicious word.",
    "Yes she said at last the idea of marriage was wise.",
    "And there was no time to go far afield\nfor a husband amongst more important members of the family clan.",
    "After all the female\nline was the important one  her husband would be only the administrator of the\ninheritance that came to Renisenb and Renisenbs children.",
    "So it came to a question of Hori  a man of integrity of old and longproved friendship the\nson of a small landowner whose estate had adjoined their own  or young Kameni with his\nclaims of cousinship.",
    "Esa had weighed the matter carefully before speaking.",
    "A false word now  and disaster\nmight result.",
    "Then she had made her answer stressing it with the force of her indomitable personality.",
    "Kameni she said was undoubtedly the husband for Renisenb.",
    "Their declarations and the\nnecessary attendant festivities  much curtailed owing to the recent bereavements  might\ntake place in a weeks time.",
    "That is if Renisenb was willing.",
    "Kameni was a fine young man\n together they would raise strong children.",
    "Moreover the two of them loved each other.",
    "Well Esa thought she had cast her die.",
    "The thing would be pegged out now on the gaming\nboard.",
    "It was out of her hands.",
    "She had done what she thought expedient.",
    "If it was\nhazardous as well Esa liked a match at the gaming board quite as well as Ipy had.",
    "Life was\nnot a matter of safety  it must be hazarded to win the game.",
    "She looked suspiciously round her room when she returned to it.",
    "Particularly she examined\nthe big wine jar.",
    "It was covered over and sealed as she had left it.",
    "She always sealed it when\nshe left the room and the seal hung safely round her neck.",
    "Yes  she was taking no risks of that kind.",
    "Esa chuckled with malicious satisfaction.",
    "Not so\neasy to kill an old woman.",
    "Old women knew the value of life  and knew most of the tricks\ntoo.",
    "Tomorrow  She called her little maid.",
    "Where is Hori Do you know\nThe girl replied that she thought Hori was up at the Tomb in the rock chamber.",
    "Esa nodded satisfaction.",
    "Go up to him there.",
    "Tell him that tomorrow morning when Imhotep and Yahmose are\nout on the cultivation taking Kameni with them for the counting and when Kait is at the\nlake with the children he is to come to me here.",
    "Have you understood that Repeat it.",
    "The little maid did so and Esa sent her off.",
    "Yes her plan was satisfactory.",
    "The consultation with Hori would be quite private since she\nwould send Henet on an errand to the weaving sheds.",
    "She would warn Hori of what was to\ncome and they could speak freely together.",
    "When the black girl returned with the message that Hori would do as she said Esa gave a\nsigh of relief.",
    "Now these things settled her weariness spread over her like a flood.",
    "She told the girl to\nbring the pot of sweetsmelling ointment and massage her limbs.",
    "The rhythm soothed her and the unguent eased the aching of her bones.",
    "She stretched herself out at last her head on the wooden pillow and slept  her fears for the\nmoment allayed.",
    "She woke much later with a strange sensation of coldness.",
    "Her feet her hands were\nnumbed and dead...",
    "It was like a constriction stealing all over her body.",
    "She could feel it\nnumbing her brain paralyzing her will slowing down the beat of her heart.",
    "She thought This is death...\nA strange death  death unheralded with no warning signs.",
    "This she thought is how the old die...\nAnd then a surer conviction came to her.",
    "This was not natural death This was the enemy\nstriking out of the darkness.",
    "Poison...",
    "But how When All she had eaten all she had drunk  tested secured  there had been no\nloophole of error.",
    "Then how When\nWith her last feeble flickers of intelligence Esa sought to penetrate the mystery.",
    "She must\nknow  she must  before she died.",
    "She felt the pressure increasing on her heart  the deadly coldness  the slow painful\nindrawing of her breath.",
    "How had the enemy done this thing\nAnd suddenly from the past a fleeting memory came to aid her understanding.",
    "The\nshaven skin of a lamb  a lump of smelling grease  an experiment of her fathers  to show\nthat some poisons could be absorbed by the skin.",
    "Wool fat  unguents made of wool fat.",
    "That was how the enemy had reached her.",
    "Her pot of sweetsmelling unguent so necessary\nto an Egyptian woman.",
    "The poison had been in that...\nAnd tomorrow  Hori  he would not know  she could not tell him...",
    "It was too late.",
    "In the morning a frightened little slave girl went running through the house crying out that\nher lady had died in her sleep.",
    "II\nImhotep stood looking down on Esas dead body.",
    "His face was sorrowful but not\nsuspicious.",
    "His mother he said had died naturally enough of old age.",
    "She was old he said.",
    "Yes she was old.",
    "It was doubtless time for her to go to Osiris and\nall our troubles and sorrows have hastened the end.",
    "But it seems to have come peacefully\nenough.",
    "Thank Re in his mercy that here is a death unaided by man or by evil spirit.",
    "There\nis no violence here.",
    "See how peaceful she looks.",
    "Renisenb wept and Yahmose comforted her.",
    "Henet went about sighing and shaking her\nhead and saying what a loss Esa would be and how devoted she Henet had always been to\nher.",
    "Kameni checked his singing and showed a proper mourning face.",
    "Hori came and stood looking down at the dead woman.",
    "It was the hour of her summons to\nhim.",
    "He wondered what exactly she had meant to say.",
    "She had had something definite to tell him.",
    "Now he would never know.",
    "But he thought perhaps that he could guess...\nChapter 21\nSECOND MONTH OF SUMMER 16TH DAY\nHori  was she killed\nI think so Renisenb.",
    "How\nI do not know.",
    "But she was so careful.",
    "The girls voice was distressed and bewildered.",
    "She was always\non the watch.",
    "She took every precaution.",
    "Everything she ate and drank was proved and\ntested.",
    "I know Renisenb.",
    "But all the same I think she was killed.",
    "And she was the wisest of us all  the cleverest She was so sure that no harm could befall\nher.",
    "Hori it must be magic Evil magic the spell of an evil spirit.",
    "You believe that because it is the easiest thing to believe.",
    "People are like that.",
    "But Esa\nherself would not have believed it.",
    "If she knew  before she died and did not die in her sleep\n she knew it was a living persons work.",
    "And she knew whose\nYes.",
    "She had shown her suspicion too openly.",
    "She became a danger to the enemy.",
    "The fact\nthat she died proves that her suspicion was correct.",
    "And she told you  who it was\nNo said Hori.",
    "She did not tell me.",
    "She never mentioned a name.",
    "Nevertheless her\nthought and my thought were I am convinced the same.",
    "Then you must tell me Hori so that I may be on my guard.",
    "No Renisenb I care too much for your safety to do that.",
    "Am I so safe\nHoris face darkened.",
    "He said No Renisenb you are not safe.",
    "No one is safe.",
    "But you are\nmuch safer than if you were assured of the truth  for then you would become a definite\nmenace to be removed at once whatever the risk.",
    "What about you Hori You know.",
    "He corrected her.",
    "I think I know.",
    "But I have said nothing and shown nothing.",
    "Esa was\nunwise.",
    "She spoke out.",
    "She showed the direction in which her thoughts were tending.",
    "She\nshould not have done that  I told her so afterwards.",
    "But you  Hori...",
    "If anything happens to you...\n\n\fShe stopped.",
    "She was aware of Horis eyes looking into hers.",
    "Grave intent seeing straight into her mind and heart...",
    "He took her hands in his and held them lightly.",
    "Do not fear for me little Renisenb... All will be well.",
    "Yes she thought all will indeed be well if Hori says so.",
    "Strange that feeling of content of\npeace of clear singing happiness  as lovely and as remote as the far distance seen from the\nTomb  a distance in which there was no clamor of human demands and restrictions.",
    "Suddenly almost harshly she heard herself saying\nI am to marry Kameni.",
    "Hori let her hands go  quietly and quite naturally.",
    "I know Renisenb.",
    "They  my father  they think it is the best thing.",
    "I know.",
    "He moved away.",
    "The courtyard walls seemed to come nearer the voices within the house and from the\ncornbins outside sounded louder and noisier.",
    "Renisenb had only one thought in her mind Hori is going...\nShe called to him timidly\nHori where are you going\nOut to the fields with Yahmose.",
    "There is much work there to be done and recorded.",
    "The\nreaping is nearly finished.",
    "And Kameni\nKameni comes with us.",
    "Renisenb cried out I am afraid here.",
    "Yes even in daylight with the servants all round\nand Re sailing across the heavens I am afraid.",
    "He came quickly back.",
    "Do not be afraid Renisenb.",
    "I swear to you that you need not be afraid.",
    "Not today.",
    "But after today\nToday is enough to live through  and I swear to you you are not in danger today.",
    "Renisenb looked at him and frowned.",
    "But we are in danger Yahmose my father myself It is not I who am threatened first... is\nthat what you think\nTry not to think about it Renisenb.",
    "I am doing all I can though it may appear to you that\nI am doing nothing.",
    "I see  Renisenb looked at him thoughtfully.",
    "Yes I see.",
    "It is to be Yahmose first.",
    "The\nenemy has tried twice with poison and failed.",
    "There is to be a third attempt.",
    "That is why\nyou will be close beside him  to protect him.",
    "And after that it will be the turn of my father\nand myself.",
    "Who is there who hates our family so much that \nHush.",
    "You would do well not to talk of these things.",
    "Trust me Renisenb.",
    "Try to banish\nfear from your mind.",
    "Renisenb threw her head back.",
    "She faced him proudly.",
    "I do trust you Hori.",
    "You will not let me die...",
    "I love life very much and I do not want to\nleave it.",
    "You shall not leave it Renisenb.",
    "Nor you either Hori.",
    "Nor I either.",
    "They smiled at each other and then Hori went away to find Yahmose.",
    "II\nRenisenb sat back on her haunches watching Kait.",
    "Kait was helping the children to model\ntoys out of clay using the water of the lake.",
    "Her fingers were busy kneading and shaping\nand her voice encouraged the two small serious boys at their task.",
    "Kaits face was the same\nas usual affectionate plain expressionless.",
    "The surrounding atmosphere of violent death\nand constant fear seemed to affect her not at all...\nHori had bidden Renisenb not to think but with the best will in the world Renisenb could\nnot obey.",
    "If Hori knew the enemy if Esa had known the enemy then there was no reason\nwhy she should not know the enemy too.",
    "She might be safer not knowing but no human\ncreature could be content to have it that way.",
    "She wanted to know.",
    "And it must be very easy  very easy indeed.",
    "Her father clearly could not desire to kill his\nown children.",
    "So that left  who did it leave It left starkly and uncompromisingly two\npeople  Kait and Henet.",
    "Women both of them...\nAnd surely with no reason for killing...",
    "Yet Henet hated them all...",
    "Yes undoubtedly Henet hated them.",
    "She had admitted hating\nRenisenb.",
    "So why should she not hate the others equally\nRenisenb tried to project herself into the dim tortured recesses of Henets brain.",
    "Living\nhere all these years working protesting her devotion lying spying making mischief...\nComing here long ago as the poor relative of a great and beautiful lady.",
    "Seeing that lovely\nlady happy with husband and children.",
    "Repudiated by her own husband her only child\ndead...",
    "Yes that might be the way of it.",
    "Like a wound from a spear thrust that Renisenb\nhad once seen.",
    "It had healed quickly over the surface but beneath evil matters had festered\nand raged and the arm had swollen and had gone hard to the touch.",
    "And then the\nphysician had come and with a suitable incantation had plunged a small knife into the\nhard swollen distorted limb.",
    "It had been like the breaking down of an irrigation dike.",
    "A\ngreat stream of evilsmelling stuff had come welling out...\nThat perhaps was like Henets mind.",
    "Sorrow and injury smoothed over too quickly  and\nfestering poison beneath ever swelling in a great tide of hate and venom.",
    "But did Henet hate Imhotep too Surely not.",
    "For years she had fluttered round him\nfawning on him flattering him...",
    "He believed in her implicitly.",
    "Surely that devotion could\nnot be wholly feigned\nAnd if she were devoted to him could she deliberately inflict all this sorrow and loss upon\nhim\nAh but suppose she hated him too  had always hated him Had flattered him deliberately\nwith a view to bringing out his weaknesses Supposing Imhotep was the one she hated\nmost Then to a distorted evilridden mind what better pleasure could there be than this to let him see his children die off one by one\nWhat is the matter Renisenb\nKait was staring at her.",
    "You look so strange.",
    "Renisenb stood up.",
    "I feel as though I were going to vomit she said.",
    "In a sense it was true enough.",
    "The picture she had been conjuring up induced in her a\nstrong feeling of nausea.",
    "Kait accepted the words at their face value.",
    "You have eaten too many green dates  or perhaps the fish had turned.",
    "No no it is nothing I have eaten.",
    "It is the terrible thing we are living through.",
    "Oh that.",
    "Kaits disclaimer was so nonchalant that Renisenb stared at her.",
    "But Kait are you not afraid\nNo I do not think so.",
    "Kait considered.",
    "If anything happens to Imhotep the children\nwill be protected by Hori.",
    "Hori is honest.",
    "He will guard their inheritance for them.",
    "Yahmose will do that.",
    "Yahmose will die too.",
    "Kait you say that so calmly.",
    "Do you not mind at all I mean that my father and Yahmose\nshould die\nKait considered a moment or two.",
    "Then she shrugged her shoulders.",
    "We are two women together.",
    "Let us be honest.",
    "Imhotep I have always considered\ntyrannical and unfair.",
    "He behaved outrageously in the matter of his concubine  letting\nhimself be persuaded by her to disinherit his own flesh and blood.",
    "I have never liked\nImhotep.",
    "As to Yahmose  he is nothing.",
    "Satipy ruled him in every way.",
    "Lately since she is\ngone he takes authority on himself gives orders.",
    "He would always prefer his children\nbefore mine  that is natural.",
    "So if he is to die it is as well for my children that it should be\nso  that is how I see it.",
    "Hori has no children and he is just.",
    "All these happenings have been\nupsetting  but I have been thinking lately that very likely they are all for the best.",
    "You can talk like that Kait  so calmly so coldly  when your own husband whom you\nloved was the first to be killed\nA faint expression of some indefinable nature passed over Kaits face.",
    "She gave Renisenb a\nglance which seemed to contain a certain scornful irony.",
    "You are very like Teti sometimes Renisenb.",
    "Really one would swear no older\nYou do not mourn for Sobek.",
    "Renisenb spoke the words slowly.",
    "No I have noticed\nthat.",
    "Come Renisenb I fulfilled all the conventions.",
    "I know how a newly made widow should\nbehave.",
    "Yes  that was all there was to it...",
    "So  it means  that you did not love Sobek\nKait shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Why should I\nKait He was your husband  he gave you children.",
    "Kaits expression softened.",
    "She looked down at the two small boys engrossed with the clay\nand then to where Ankh was rolling about chanting to herself and waving her little legs.",
    "Yes he gave me my children.",
    "For that I thank him.",
    "But what was he after all A\nhandsome braggart  a man who was always going to other women.",
    "He did not take a sister\ndecently into the household some modest person who would have been useful to us all.",
    "No\nhe went to illfamed houses spending much copper and gold there drinking too and asking\nfor all the most expensive dancing girls.",
    "It was fortunate that Imhotep kept him as short as\nhe did and that he had to account so closely for the sales he made on the estate.",
    "What love\nand respect should I have for a man like that And what are men anyway They are\nnecessary to breed children that is all.",
    "But the strength of the race is in the women.",
    "It is\nwe Renisenb who hand down to our children all that is ours.",
    "As for men let them breed\n\n\fand die early...",
    "The scorn and contempt in Kaits voice rose in a note like some musical instrument.",
    "Her\nstrong ugly face was transfigured.",
    "Renisenb thought with dismay\nKait is strong.",
    "If she is stupid it is with a stupidity that is satisfied with itself.",
    "She hates\nand despises men.",
    "I should have known.",
    "Once before I caught a glimpse of this  this\nmenacing quality.",
    "Yes Kait is strong \nUnthinkingly Renisenbs gaze fell to Kaits hands.",
    "They were squeezing and kneading clay\n strong muscular hands and as Renisenb watched them pushing down the clay she\nthought of Ipy and of strong hands pushing his head down into the water and holding it\nthere inexorably.",
    "Yes Kaits hands could have done that...",
    "The little girl Ankh rolled over onto a thorny spice and set up a wail.",
    "Kait rushed to her.",
    "She picked her up holding her to her breast crooning over her.",
    "Her face now was all love\nand tenderness.",
    "Henet came running out from the porch.",
    "Is anything wrong The child yelled so loud.",
    "I thought perhaps \nShe paused disappointed.",
    "Her eager mean spiteful face hoping for some catastrophe fell.",
    "Renisenb looked from one woman to the other.",
    "Hate in one face.",
    "Love in the other.",
    "Which she wondered was the more terrible\nIII\nYahmose be careful of Kait.",
    "Of Kait Yahmose showed his astonishment.",
    "My dear Renisenb \nI tell you she is dangerous.",
    "Our quiet Kait She has always been a meek submissive woman not very clever \nRenisenb interrupted him.",
    "She is neither meek nor submissive.",
    "I am afraid of her Yahmose.",
    "I want you to be on your\nguard.",
    "Against Kait He was still incredulous.",
    "I can hardly see Kait dealing out death all\nround.",
    "She would not have the brains.",
    "I do not think that it is brains that are concerned.",
    "A knowledge of poisons  that is all that\nhas been needed.",
    "And you know that such knowledge is often found amongst certain\nfamilies.",
    "They hand it down from mother to daughter.",
    "They brew these concoctions\nthemselves from potent herbs.",
    "It is the kind of lore that Kait might easily have.",
    "She brews\nmedicines for the children when they are ill you know.",
    "Yes that is true.",
    "Yahmose spoke thoughtfully.",
    "Henet too is an evil woman went on Renisenb.",
    "Henet  yes.",
    "We have never liked her.",
    "In fact but for my fathers protection \nOur father is deceived in her said Renisenb.",
    "That may well be.",
    "Yahmose added in a matteroffact tone She flatters him.",
    "Renisenb looked at him for a moment in surprise.",
    "It was the first time she had ever heard\nYahmose utter a sentence containing criticism of Imhotep.",
    "He had always seemed\noverawed by his father.",
    "But now she realized Yahmose was gradually taking the lead.",
    "Imhotep had aged by years\nin the last few weeks.",
    "He was incapable now of giving orders of making decisions.",
    "Even his\n\n\fphysical activity seemed impaired.",
    "He spent long hours staring in front of him his eyes\nfilmed and abstracted.",
    "Sometimes he seemed not to understand what was said to him.",
    "Do you think that she  Renisenb stopped.",
    "She looked round and began Is it she do\nyou think who has  who is  \nYahmose caught her by the arm.",
    "Be quiet Renisenb.",
    "These things are better not said  not even whispered.",
    "Then you too think \nYahmose said softly and urgently\nSay nothing now.",
    "We have plans.",
    "Chapter 22\nSECOND MONTH OF SUMMER 17TH DAY\nThe following day was the festival of the new moon.",
    "Imhotep was forced to go up to the\nTomb to make the offerings.",
    "Yahmose begged his father to leave it to him on this occasion\nbut Imhotep was obdurate.",
    "With what seemed now a feeble parody of his old manner he\nmurmured Unless I see to things myself how can I be sure they are properly done Have\nI ever shirked my duties Have I not provided for all of you supported you all \nHis voice stopped.",
    "All All Ah I forget  my two brave sons  my handsome Sobek  my\nclever and beloved Ipy  gone from me.",
    "Yahmose and Renisenb  my dear son and daughter\n you are still with me  but for how long  how long\nMany long years we hope said Yahmose.",
    "He spoke rather loudly as to a deaf man.",
    "Eh What Imhotep seemed to have fallen into a coma.",
    "He said suddenly and surprisingly\nIt depends on Henet does it not Yes it depends on Henet.",
    "Yahmose and Renisenb exchanged glances.",
    "Renisenb said gently and clearly\nI do not understand you Father.",
    "Imhotep muttered something they did not catch.",
    "Then raising his voice a little but with\ndull and vacant eyes he said\nHenet understands me.",
    "She always has.",
    "She knows how great my responsibilities are how great.",
    "Yes how great... And always ingratitude...",
    "Therefore there must be retribution.",
    "That I think is a practice wellestablished.",
    "Presumption must be punished.",
    "Henet has\nalways been modest humble and devoted.",
    "She shall be rewarded...",
    "He drew himself up and said pompously\nYou understand Yahmose.",
    "Henet is to have all she wants.",
    "Her commands are to be\nobeyed\nBut why is this Father\nBecause I say so.",
    "Because if what Henet wants is done there will be no more deaths...",
    "He nodded his head sagely and went away  leaving Yahmose and Renisenb staring at each\nother in wonder and alarm.",
    "What does this mean Yahmose\nI do not know Renisenb.",
    "Sometimes I think my father no longer knows what he does or\nsays.",
    "No  perhaps not.",
    "But I think Yahmose that Henet knows very well what she is saying\n\n\fand doing.",
    "She said to me only the other day that it would soon be she who would crack\nthe whip in this house.",
    "They looked at each other.",
    "Then Yahmose put his hand on Renisenbs arm.",
    "Do not anger her.",
    "You show your feelings too plainly Renisenb.",
    "You heard what my\nfather said If what Henet wants is done  there will be no more deaths...\nII\nHenet was crouching down on her haunches in one of the storerooms counting out piles of\nsheets.",
    "They were old sheets and she held the mark on the corner of one close up to her\neyes.",
    "Ashayet she murmured.",
    "Ashayets sheets.",
    "Marked with the year she came here  she\nand I together... Thats a long time ago.",
    "Do you know I wonder what your sheets are being\nused for now Ashayet\nShe broke off in the midst of a chuckle and gave a start as a sound made her glance over\nher shoulder.",
    "It was Yahmose.",
    "What are you doing Henet\nThe embalmers need more sheets.",
    "Piles and piles of sheets theyve used.",
    "Four hundred\ncubits they used yesterday alone.",
    "Its terrible the way these funerals use up the sheeting\nWell have to use these old ones.",
    "Theyre good quality and not much worn.",
    "Your mothers\nsheets Yahmose.",
    "Yes your mothers sheets...\nWho said you might take those\nHenet laughed.",
    "Imhoteps given everything into my charge.",
    "I dont have to ask leave.",
    "He trusts poor old\nHenet.",
    "He knows shell see to everything in the right way.",
    "Ive seen to most things in this\nhouse for a long time.",
    "I think  now  Im going to have my reward\nIt looks like it Henet.",
    "Yahmoses tone was mild.",
    "My father said  he paused everything depends on you.",
    "Did he now Well thats nice hearing  but perhaps you dont think so Yahmose.",
    "Well  Im not quite sure.",
    "Yahmoses tone was still mild but he watched her closely.",
    "I think youd better agree with your father Yahmose.",
    "We dont want any more  trouble\ndo we\nI dont quite understand.",
    "You mean  we dont want any more deaths\nThere are going to be more deaths Yahmose.",
    "Oh yes \nWho is going to die next Henet\nWhy do you think I should know that\nBecause I think you know a great deal.",
    "You knew the other day for instance that Ipy was\ngoing to die... You are very clever arent you Henet\nHenet bridled.",
    "So youre beginning to realize that now Im not poor stupid Henet any longer.",
    "Im the\none who knows.",
    "What do you know Henet\nHenets voice changed.",
    "It was low and sharp.",
    "I know that at last I can do as I choose in this house.",
    "There will be no one to stop me.",
    "Imhotep leans upon me already.",
    "And you will do the same eh Yahmose\n\n\fAnd Renisenb\nHenet laughed a malicious happy chuckle.",
    "Renisenb will not be here.",
    "You think it is Renisenb who will die next\nWhat do you think Yahmose\nI am waiting to hear what you say.",
    "Perhaps I only meant that Renisenb will marry  and go away.",
    "What do you mean Henet\nHenet chuckled.",
    "Esa once said my tongue was dangerous.",
    "Perhaps it is\nShe laughed shrilly swaying to and fro on her heels.",
    "Well Yahmose what do you say Am I at last to do as I choose in this house\nYahmose studied her for a moment before saying\nYes Henet.",
    "You are so clever.",
    "You shall do as you choose.",
    "He turned to meet Hori who was coming from the main hall and who said\nThere you are Yahmose.",
    "Imhotep is awaiting you.",
    "It is time to go up to the Tomb.",
    "Yahmose nodded.",
    "I am coming.",
    "He lowered his voice.",
    "Hori  I think Henet is mad  she is definitely\nafflicted by devils.",
    "I begin to believe that she has been responsible for all these\nhappenings.",
    "Hori paused a moment before saying in his quiet detached voice\nShe is a strange woman  and an evil one I think.",
    "Yahmose lowered his voice still more\nHori I think Renisenb is in danger.",
    "From Henet\nYes.",
    "She has just hinted that Renisenb may be the next to go.",
    "Imhoteps voice came fretfully\nAm I to wait all day What conduct is this No one considers me any more.",
    "No one knows\nwhat I suffer.",
    "Where is Henet Henet understands.",
    "From within the storeroom Henets chuckle of triumph came shrilly.",
    "Do you hear that Yahmose Henet Henet is the one\nYahmose said fiercely\nYes Henet  I understand.",
    "You are the powerful one.",
    "You and my father and I  we three\ntogether...\nHori went off to find Imhotep.",
    "Yahmose spoke a few more words to Henet who nodded\nher face sparkling with malicious triumph.",
    "Then Yahmose joined Hori and Imhotep apologizing for his delay and the three men went\nup to the Tomb together.",
    "III\nThe day passed slowly for Renisenb.",
    "She was restless passing to and fro from the house to the porch then to the lake and then\nback again to the house.",
    "At midday Imhotep returned and after a meal had been served to him he came out upon\nthe porch and Renisenb joined him.",
    "She sat with her hands clasped round her knees occasionally looking up at her fathers\nface.",
    "It still wore that absent bewildered expression.",
    "Imhotep spoke little.",
    "Once or twice he\nsighed deeply.",
    "Once he roused himself and asked for Henet.",
    "But just at that time Henet had gone with\nlinen to the embalmers.",
    "Renisenb asked her father where Hori and Yahmose were.",
    "Hori has gone out to the far flax fields.",
    "There is a tally to be taken there.",
    "Yahmose is on\nthe cultivation.",
    "It all falls on him now... Alas for Sobek and Ipy.",
    "My boys  my handsome\nboys...\nRenisenb tried quickly to distract him.",
    "Cannot Kameni oversee the workers\nKameni Who is Kameni I have no son of that name.",
    "Kameni the scribe.",
    "Kameni who is to be my husband.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "You Renisenb But you are to marry Khay.",
    "She sighed but said no more.",
    "It seemed cruel to try to bring him back to the present.",
    "After a little while however he roused himself and exclaimed suddenly\nOf course Kameni He has gone to give some instructions to the overseer at the brewery.",
    "I\nmust go and join him.",
    "He strode away muttering to himself but with a resumption of his old manner so that\nRenisenb felt a little cheered.",
    "Perhaps this clouding of his brain was only temporary.",
    "She looked round her.",
    "There seemed something sinister about the silence of the house and\ncourt today.",
    "The children were at the far side of the lake.",
    "Kait was not with them and\nRenisenb wondered where she was.",
    "Then Henet came out onto the porch.",
    "She looked round her and then came sidling up to\nRenisenb.",
    "She had resumed her old wheedling humble manner.",
    "Ive been waiting till I could get you alone Renisenb.",
    "Why Henet\nHenet lowered her voice.",
    "Ive got a message for you  from Hori.",
    "What does he say Renisenbs voice was eager.",
    "He asks that you should go up to the Tomb.",
    "Now\nNo.",
    "Be there an hour before sunset.",
    "That was the message.",
    "If he is not there then he asks\nthat you will wait until he comes.",
    "It is important he says.",
    "Henet paused  and then added\nI was to wait until I got you alone to say this  and no one was to overhear.",
    "Henet glided away again.",
    "Renisenb felt her spirits lightened.",
    "She felt glad at the prospect of going up to the peace and\nquietness of the Tomb.",
    "Glad that she would see Hori and be able to talk to him freely.",
    "The\nonly thing that surprised her a little was that he should have entrusted his message to\nHenet.",
    "Nevertheless malicious though Henet was she had delivered the message faithfully.",
    "And why should I fear Henet at any time thought Renisenb.",
    "I am stronger than she\nis.",
    "She drew herself up proudly.",
    "She felt young and confident and very much alive...\nIV\nAfter giving the message to Renisenb Henet went once more into the linen storeroom.",
    "She\nwas laughing quietly to herself.",
    "She bent over the disordered piles of sheets.",
    "Well be needing more of you soon she said to them gleefully.",
    "Do you hear Ashayet\nIm the mistress here now and Im telling you that your linen will bandage yet another\nbody.",
    "And whose body is that do you think Hee hee Youve not been able to do much\nabout things have you You and your mothers brother the Nomarch Justice What\njustice can you do in this world Answer me that\nThere was a movement behind the bales of linen.",
    "Henet half turned her head.",
    "Then a great width of linen was thrown over her stifling her mouth and nose.",
    "An\ninexorable hand wound the fabric round and round her body swathing her like a corpse\nuntil her struggles ceased...\nChapter 23\nSECOND MONTH OF SUMMER 17TH DAY\nRenisenb sat in the entrance of the rock chamber staring out at the Nile and lost in a queer\ndream fantasy of her own.",
    "It seemed to her a very long time since the day when she had first sat here soon after her\nreturn to her fathers house.",
    "That had been the day when she had declared so gaily that\neverything was unchanged that all in the home was exactly as it had been when she left it\neight years before.",
    "She remembered now how Hori had told her that she herself was not the same Renisenb\nwho had gone away with Khay and how she had answered confidently that she soon would\nbe.",
    "Then Hori had gone on to speak of changes that came from within of a rottenness that left\nno outward sign.",
    "She knew now something of what had been in his mind when he said those things.",
    "He had\nbeen trying to prepare her.",
    "She had been so assured so blind  accepting so easily the\noutward values of her family.",
    "It had taken Nofrets coming to open her eyes...",
    "Yes Nofrets coming.",
    "It had all hinged on that.",
    "With Nofret had come death...",
    "Whether Nofret had been evil or not she had certainly brought evil...\nAnd the evil was still in their midst.",
    "For the last time Renisenb played with the belief that Nofrets spirit was the cause of\neverything...\nNofret malicious and dead...\nOr Henet malicious and living... Henet the despised the sycophantic fawning Henet...\nRenisenb shivered stirred and then slowly rose to her feet.",
    "She could wait for Hori no longer.",
    "The sun was on the point of setting.",
    "Why she wondered\nhad he not come\n\n\fShe got up glanced round her and started to descend the path to the valley below.",
    "It was very quiet at this evening hour.",
    "Quiet and beautiful she thought.",
    "What had delayed\nHori If he had come they would at least have had this hour together...",
    "There would not be many such hours.",
    "In the near future when she was Kamenis wife Was she really going to marry Kameni With a kind of shock Renisenb shook herself free\nfrom the mood of dull acquiescence that had held her so long.",
    "She felt like a sleeper\nawakening from a feverish dream.",
    "Caught in that stupor of fear and uncertainty she had\nassented to whatever had been proposed to her.",
    "But now she was Renisenb again and if she married Kameni it would be because she\nwanted to marry him and not because her family arranged it.",
    "Kameni with his handsome\nlaughing face She loved him didnt she That was why she was going to marry him.",
    "In this evening hour up here there were clarity and truth.",
    "No confusion.",
    "She was Renisenb\nwalking here above the world serene and unafraid herself at last.",
    "Had she not once said to Hori that she must walk down this path alone at the hour of\nNofrets death  that whether fear went with her or not she must still go alone\nWell she was doing it now.",
    "This was just about the hour when she and Satipy had bent\nover Nofrets body.",
    "And it was about this same hour when Satipy in her turn had walked\ndown the path and had suddenly looked back  to see doom overtaking her.",
    "At just about this same point too.",
    "What was it that Satipy had heard to make her look\nsuddenly behind her\nFootsteps\nFootsteps... but Renisenb heard footsteps now  following her down the path.",
    "Her heart gave a sudden leap of fear.",
    "It was true then Nofret was behind her following\nher...",
    "Fear coursed through her but her footsteps did not slacken.",
    "Nor did they race ahead.",
    "She\nmust overcome fear since there was in her mind no evil deed to regret...\nShe steadied herself gathered her courage and still walking turned her head.",
    "Then she felt a great throb of relief.",
    "It was Yahmose following her.",
    "No spirit from the dead\nbut her own brother.",
    "He must have been busied in the offering chamber of the Tomb and\nhave come out of it just after she had passed.",
    "She stopped with a happy little cry.",
    "Oh Yahmose Im so glad its you.",
    "He was coming up to her rapidly.",
    "She was just beginning another sentence  a recital of her\nfoolish fears  when the words froze on her lips.",
    "This was not the Yahmose she knew  the gentle kindly brother.",
    "His eyes were very bright\nand he was passing his tongue quickly over dried lips.",
    "His hands held a little in front of his\nbody were slightly curved the fingers looking like talons.",
    "He was looking at her and the look in his eyes was unmistakable.",
    "It was the look of a man\nwho had killed and was about to kill again.",
    "There was a gloating cruelty an evil\nsatisfaction in his face.",
    "Yahmose  the hidden enemy was Yahmose Behind the mask of that gentle kindly face this\nShe had thought that her brother loved her  but there was no love in that inhuman\ngloating face.",
    "Renisenb screamed  a faint hopeless scream.",
    "This she knew was death.",
    "There was no strength in her to match Yahmoses strength.",
    "Here where Nofret had fallen where the path was narrow she too would fall to death...\nYahmose It was a last appeal  in that uttering of his name was the love she had always\ngiven to this eldest brother.",
    "It pleaded in vain.",
    "Yahmose laughed a soft inhuman happy\nlittle laugh.",
    "Then he rushed forward those cruel hands with talons curving as though they longed to\nfasten round her throat...\nRenisenb backed up against the cliff face her hands outstretched in a vain attempt to ward\nhim off.",
    "This was terror  death.",
    "And then she heard a sound a faint twanging musical sound...\nSomething came singing through the air.",
    "Yahmose stopped swayed then with a loud cry\nhe pitched forward on his face at her feet.",
    "She stared down stupidly at the feather shaft of\nan arrow.",
    "Then she looked down over the edge  to where Hori stood the bow still held to his\nshoulder...\nII\nYahmose... Yahmose...\nRenisenb numbed by shock repeated the name again and yet again.",
    "It was as though she\ncould not believe it...\nShe was outside the little rock chamber Horis arm still round her.",
    "She could hardly\nrecollect how he had led her back up the path.",
    "She had been only able to repeat her\nbrothers name in that dazed tone of wonder and horror.",
    "Hori said gently\nYes Yahmose.",
    "All the time Yahmose.",
    "But how Why And how could it be he Why he was poisoned himself.",
    "He nearly died.",
    "No he ran no risk of dying.",
    "He was very careful of how much wine he drank.",
    "He sipped\nenough to make him ill and he exaggerated his symptoms and his pains.",
    "It was the one way\nhe knew to disarm suspicion.",
    "But he could not have killed Ipy.",
    "Why he was so weak he could not stand on his feet\nThat again was feigned.",
    "Do you not remember that Mersu pronounced that once the\npoison was eliminated he would regain strength quickly.",
    "So he did in reality.",
    "But why Hori That is what I cannot make out  why\nHori sighed.",
    "Do you remember Renisenb that I talked to you once of the rottenness that comes from\nwithin\nI remember.",
    "Indeed I was thinking of it only this evening.",
    "You said once that the coming of Nofret brought evil.",
    "That was not true.",
    "The evil was\nalready here concealed within the hearts of the household.",
    "All that Nofrets coming did was\nto bring it from its hidden place into light.",
    "Her presence banished concealment.",
    "Kaits\ngentle motherliness had turned to ruthless egoism for herself and her young.",
    "Sobek was no\nlonger the gay and charming young man but the boastful dissipated weakling.",
    "Ipy was not\nso much a spoilt attractive child as a scheming selfish boy.",
    "Through Henets pretended\ndevotion the venom began to show clearly.",
    "Satipy showed herself as a bully and a coward.",
    "Imhotep himself had degenerated into a fussy pompous tyrant.",
    "I know  I know.",
    "Renisenbs hands went to her eyes.",
    "You need not tell me.",
    "I have found\n\n\fout little by little for myself... Why should these things happen Why should this rottenness\ncome as you say working from within\nHori shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Who can tell It may be that there must always be growth  and that if one does not grow\nkinder and wiser and greater then the growth must be the other way fostering the evil\nthings.",
    "Or it may be that the life they all led was too shut in too folded back upon itself without breadth or vision.",
    "Or it may be that like a disease of crops it is contagious that\nfirst one and then another sickened.",
    "But Yahmose  Yahmose seemed always the same.",
    "Yes and that is one reason Renisenb why I came to suspect.",
    "For the others by reason of\ntheir temperaments could get relief.",
    "But Yahmose has always been timid easily ruled and\nwith never enough courage to rebel.",
    "He loved Imhotep and worked hard to please him and\nImhotep found him wellmeaning but stupid and slow.",
    "He despised him.",
    "Satipy too treated\nYahmose with all the scorn of a bullying nature.",
    "Slowly his burden of resentment\nconcealed but deeply felt grew heavier.",
    "The meeker he seemed the more his inward anger\ngrew.",
    "And then just when Yahmose was hoping at last to reap the reward of his industry and\ndiligence to be recognized and associated with his father Nofret came.",
    "It was Nofret and\nperhaps Nofrets beauty that kindled the final spark.",
    "She attacked the manhood of all\nthree brothers.",
    "She touched Sobek on the raw by her scorn of him as a fool she infuriated\nIpy by treating him as a truculent child without any claim to manhood and she showed\nYahmose that he was something less than a man in her eyes.",
    "It was after Nofret came that\nSatipys tongue finally goaded Yahmose beyond endurance.",
    "It was her jeers her taunt that\nshe was a better man than he that finally sapped his selfcontrol.",
    "He met Nofret on this\npath and  driven beyond endurance  he threw her down.",
    "But it was Satipy \nNo no Renisenb.",
    "That is where you were all wrong.",
    "From down below Satipy saw it\nhappen.",
    "Now do you understand\nBut Yahmose was with you on the cultivation.",
    "Yes for the last hour.",
    "But do you not realize Renisenb that Nofrets body was cold You\nfelt her cheek yourself.",
    "You thought she had fallen a few moments before  but that was\nimpossible.",
    "She had been dead at least two hours otherwise in that hot sun her face could\nnever have felt cold to your touch.",
    "Satipy saw it happen.",
    "Satipy hung around fearful\nuncertain what to do then she saw you coming and tried to head you off.",
    "Hori when did you know all this\nI guessed fairly soon.",
    "It was Satipys behavior that told me.",
    "She was obviously going about\nin deadly fear of someone or something  and I was fairly soon convinced that the person\nshe feared was Yahmose.",
    "She stopped bullying him and instead was eager to obey him in\nevery way.",
    "It had been you see a terrible shock to her.",
    "Yahmose whom she despised as the\nmeekest of men had actually been the one to kill Nofret.",
    "It turned Satipys world upside\ndown.",
    "Like most bullying women she was a coward.",
    "This new Yahmose terrified her.",
    "In\nher fear she began to talk in her sleep.",
    "Yahmose soon realized that she was a danger to\nhim...\nAnd now Renisenb you can realize the truth of what you saw that day  with your own\neyes.",
    "It was not a spirit Satipy saw that caused her to fall.",
    "She saw what you saw today.",
    "She\nsaw in the face of the man following her  her own husband  the intention to throw her\n\n\fdown as he had thrown that other woman.",
    "In her fear she backed away from him and fell.",
    "And when with her dying lips she shaped the word Nofret she was trying to tell you that\nYahmose killed Nofret.",
    "Hori paused and then went on\nEsa came on the truth because of an entirely irrelevant remark made by Henet.",
    "Henet\ncomplained that I did not look at her but as though I saw something behind her that was\nnot there.",
    "She went on to speak of Satipy.",
    "In a flash Esa saw how much simpler the whole\nthing was than we had thought.",
    "Satipy did not look at something behind Yahmose  it was\nYahmose himself she saw.",
    "To test her idea Esa introduced the subject in a rambling way\nwhich could mean nothing to anyone except Yahmose himself  and only to him if what she\nsuspected was true.",
    "Her words surprised him and he reacted to them just for a moment\nsufficiently for her to know that what she suspected was the truth.",
    "But Yahmose knew then\nthat she did suspect.",
    "And once a suspicion had arisen things would fit in too well even to\nthe story the herd boy told  a boy devoted to him who would do anything his Lord\nYahmose commanded  even to swallowing a medicine that night which ensured that he\nwould not wake again...\nOh Hori it is so hard to believe that Yahmose could do such things.",
    "Nofret yes I can\nunderstand that.",
    "But why these other killings\nIt is difficult to explain to you Renisenb but once the heart is opened to evil  evil\nblossoms like poppies amongst the corn.",
    "All his life Yahmose had had perhaps a longing\nfor violence and had been unable to achieve it.",
    "He despised his own meek submissive role.",
    "I\nthink that the killing of Nofret gave him a great sense of power.",
    "He realized it first by\nSatipy.",
    "Satipy who had browbeaten and abused him was now meek and terrified.",
    "All the\ngrievances that had laid buried in his heart so long reared their heads  as that snake\nreared up on the path here one day.",
    "Sobek and Ipy were one handsomer the other\ncleverer than he  so they must go.",
    "He Yahmose was to be the ruler of the house and his\nfathers only comfort and stay Satipys death increased the actual pleasure of killing.",
    "He\nfelt more powerful as a result of it.",
    "It was after that that his mind began to give way  from\nthen on evil possessed him utterly.",
    "You Renisenb were not a rival.",
    "So far as he still could he loved you.",
    "But the idea that\nyour husband should share with him in the estate was not one to be borne.",
    "I think Esa\nagreed to the idea of accepting Kameni with two ideas in her head  the first that if\nYahmose struck again it would be more likely to be at Kameni than at you  and in any\ncase she trusted me to see that you were kept safe.",
    "The second idea  for Esa was a bold\nwoman  was to bring things to a head.",
    "Yahmose watched by me  whom he did not know\nsuspected him  would be caught in the act.",
    "As you did said Renisenb.",
    "Oh Hori I was so frightened when I looked back and saw\nhim.",
    "I know Renisenb.",
    "But it had to be.",
    "So long as I stuck close to Yahmoses side you would\nnecessarily be safe  but that could not go on for ever.",
    "I knew that if he had an opportunity\nof throwing you off the path at that same place he would take it.",
    "It would revive the\nsuperstitious explanation of the deaths.",
    "Then the message Henet brought me was not from you Hori shook his head.",
    "I sent you no message.",
    "But why did Henet  Renisenb stopped and shook her head.",
    "I cannot understand\nHenets part in all this.",
    "I think Henet knows the truth said Hori thoughtfully.",
    "She was conveying as much to\nYahmose this morning  a dangerous thing to do.",
    "He made use of her to lure you up here  a\nthing she would be willing to do  since she hates you Renisenb \nI know.",
    "Afterwards  I wonder Henet would believe her knowledge would give her power.",
    "But I\ndo not believe Yahmose would have let her live long.",
    "Perhaps even now \nRenisenb shivered.",
    "Yahmose was mad said Renisenb.",
    "He was possessed by evil spirits but he was not\nalways like that.",
    "No and yet  You remember Renisenb how I told you the story of Sobek and Yahmose as\nchildren and how Sobek beat Yahmoses head against the ground and how your mother\ncame all pale and trembling and said That is dangerous.",
    "I think Renisenb that her\nmeaning was that to do such things to Yahmose was dangerous.",
    "Remember that next day\nhow Sobek was ill  food poisoning they thought.",
    "I think your mother Renisenb knew\nsomething of the queer selfcontained fury that dwelt within the breast of her gentle meek\nlittle son and feared that someday it might be roused.",
    "Renisenb shuddered.",
    "Is no one what he seems\nHori smiled at her.",
    "Yes sometimes.",
    "Kameni and I Renisenb.",
    "Both of us I think are as you believe we are.",
    "Kameni and I...",
    "He said the last words with significance and suddenly Renisenb realized that she stood at a\nmoment of choice in her life.",
    "Hori went on\nWe both love you Renisenb.",
    "You must know that.",
    "And yet said Renisenb slowly you have let the arrangements be made for my\nmarriage and you have said nothing  not one word.",
    "That was for your protection.",
    "Esa had the same idea.",
    "I must remain disinterested and\naloof so that I could keep constant watch on Yahmose and not arouse his animosity.",
    "Hori\nadded with emotion You must understand Renisenb that Yahmose has been my friend\nfor many years.",
    "I loved Yahmose.",
    "I tried to induce your father to give him the status and\nauthority he desired.",
    "I failed.",
    "All that came too late.",
    "But although I was convinced in my\nheart that Yahmose had killed Nofret I tried not to believe it.",
    "I found excuses even for his\naction.",
    "Yahmose my unhappy tormented friend was very dear to me.",
    "Then came Sobeks\ndeath and Ipys and finally Esas...",
    "I knew then that the evil in Yahmose had finally\nvanquished the good.",
    "And so Yahmose has come to his death at my hands  a swift almost\npainless death.",
    "Death  always death.",
    "No Renisenb.",
    "It is not death that faces you today but life.",
    "With whom will you share that\nlife With Kameni or with me\nRenisenb stared straight ahead of her out over the valley below and to the silver streak of\nthe Nile.",
    "Before her very clearly there rose up the image of Kamenis smiling face as he had sat\nfacing her that day in the boat.",
    "Handsome strong gay... She felt again the throb and lilt of her blood.",
    "She had loved\nKameni in that moment.",
    "She loved him now.",
    "Kameni could take the place that Khay had\n\n\fheld in her life.",
    "She thought We shall be happy together  yes we shall be happy.",
    "We shall live together\nand take pleasure in each other and we shall have strong handsome children.",
    "There will be\nbusy days full of work... and days of pleasure when we sail on the River... Life will be again\nas I knew it with Khay... What could I ask more than that What do I want more than\nthat\nAnd slowly very slowly indeed she turned her face towards Hori.",
    "It was as though\nsilently she asked him a question.",
    "As though he understood her he answered\nWhen you were a child I loved you.",
    "I loved your grave face and the confidence with\nwhich you came to me asking me to mend your broken toys.",
    "And then after eight years\nabsence you came again and sat here and brought me the thoughts that were in your\nmind.",
    "And your mind Renisenb is not like the minds of the rest of your family.",
    "It does not\nturn in upon itself seeking to encase itself in narrow walls.",
    "Your mind is like my mind it\nlooks out over the River seeing a world of changes of new ideas  seeing a world where all\nthings are possible to those with courage and vision...",
    "I know Hori I know.",
    "I have felt these things with you.",
    "But not all the time.",
    "There will be\nmoments when I cannot follow you when I shall be alone...\nShe broke off unable to find words to frame her struggling thoughts.",
    "What life would be\nwith Hori she did not know.",
    "In spite of his gentleness in spite of his love for her he would\nremain in some respects incalculable and incomprehensible.",
    "They would share moments of\ngreat beauty and richness together  but what of their common daily life\nShe stretched out her hands impulsively to him.",
    "Oh Hori decide for me.",
    "Tell me what to do\nHe smiled at her at the child Renisenb speaking perhaps for the last time.",
    "But he did not\ntake her hands.",
    "I cannot tell you what to do with your life Renisenb  because it is your life  and only you\ncan decide.",
    "She realized then that she was to have no help no quickening appeal to her senses such as\nKameni had made.",
    "If Hori would only have touched her  but he did not touch her.",
    "And the choice suddenly presented itself to her in the simplest terms  the easy life or the\ndifficult one.",
    "She was strongly tempted then to turn and go down the winding path down\nto the normal happy life she already knew  that she had experienced before with Khay.",
    "There was safety there  the sharing of daily pleasures and griefs with nothing to fear but\nold age and death...\nDeath... From thoughts of life she had come full circle again to death.",
    "Khay had died.",
    "Kameni perhaps would die and his face like Khays would slowly fade from her\nmemory...\nShe looked then at Hori standing quietly beside her.",
    "It was odd she thought that she had\nnever really known just what Hori looked like... She had never needed to know...\nShe spoke then and the tone of her voice was the same as when she had announced long\nbefore that she would walk down the path at sunset alone.",
    "I have made my choice Hori.",
    "I will share my life with you for good or evil until death\ncomes...\nWith his arms round her with the sudden new sweetness of his face against hers she was\nfilled with an exultant richness of living.",
    "If Hori were to die she thought I should not forget Hori is a song in my heart for\never... That means  that there is no more death..."
