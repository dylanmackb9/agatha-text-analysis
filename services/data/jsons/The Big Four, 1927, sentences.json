    "\fAgatha Christie\n\nThe Big Four\nA Hercule Poirot Mystery\n\n\f\n\fOne\nTHE UNEXPECTED GUEST\n\nI have met people who enjoy a channel crossing men who can sit calmly in their deck\nchairs and on arrival wait until the boat is moored then gather their belongings together\nwithout fuss and disembark.",
    "Personally I can never manage this.",
    "From the moment I get on\nboard I feel that the time is too short to settle down to anything.",
    "I move my suitcases from\none spot to another and if I go down to the saloon for a meal I bolt my food with an uneasy\nfeeling that the boat may arrive unexpectedly whilst I am below.",
    "Perhaps all this is merely a\nlegacy from one\u2019s short leaves in the war when it seemed a matter of such importance to\nsecure a place near the gangway and to be amongst the first to disembark lest one should\nwaste precious minutes of one\u2019s three or five days\u2019 leave.",
    "On this particular July morning as I stood by the rail and watched the white cliffs of\nDover drawing nearer I marvelled at the passengers who could sit calmly in their chairs\nand never even raise their eyes for the first sight of their native land.",
    "Yet perhaps their case\nwas different from mine.",
    "Doubtless many of them had only crossed to Paris for the weekend\nwhereas I had spent the last year and a half on a ranch in the Argentine.",
    "I had prospered\nthere and my wife and I had both enjoyed the free and easy life of the South American\ncontinent nevertheless it was with a lump in my throat that I watched the familiar shore\ndraw nearer and nearer.",
    "I had landed in France two days before transacted some necessary business and was\nnow en route for London.",
    "I should be there some months\u2014time enough to look up old\nfriends and one old friend in particular.",
    "A little man with an eggshaped head and green\neyes\u2014Hercule Poirot I proposed to take him completely by surprise.",
    "My last letter from\nthe Argentine had given no hint of my intended voyage\u2014indeed that had been decided upon\nhurriedly as a result of certain business complications\u2014and I spent many amused moments\npicturing to myself his delight and stupefaction on beholding me.",
    "He I knew was not likely to be far from his headquarters.",
    "The time when his cases had\ndrawn him from one end of England to the other was past.",
    "His fame had spread and no\nlonger would he allow one case to absorb all his time.",
    "He aimed more and more as time\nwent on at being considered a \u201cconsulting detective\u201d\u2014as much a specialist as a Harley\nStreet physician.",
    "He had always scoffed at the popular idea of the human bloodhound who\nassumed wonderful disguises to track criminals and who paused at every footprint to\nmeasure it.",
    "\u201cNo my friend Hastings\u201d he would say \u201cwe leave that to Giraud and his friends.",
    "Hercule Poirot\u2019s methods are his own.",
    "Order and method and \u2018the little grey cells.\u2019 Sitting\nat ease in our own armchairs we see the things that these others overlook and we do not\njump to the conclusion like the worthy Japp.\u201d\nNo there was little fear of finding Hercule Poirot far afield.",
    "On arrival in London I\n\n\fdeposited my luggage at a hotel and drove straight on to the old address.",
    "What poignant\nmemories it brought back to me I hardly waited to greet my old landlady but hurried up the\nstairs two at a time and rapped on Poirot\u2019s door.",
    "\u201cEnter then\u201d cried a familiar voice from within.",
    "I strode in.",
    "Poirot stood facing me.",
    "In his arms he carried a small valise which he\ndropped with a crash on beholding me.",
    "\u201cMon ami Hastings\u201d he cried.",
    "\u201cMon ami Hastings\u201d\nAnd rushing forward he enveloped me in a capacious embrace.",
    "Our conversation was\nincoherent and inconsequent.",
    "Ejaculations eager questions incomplete answers messages\nfrom my wife explanations as to my journey were all jumbled up together.",
    "\u201cI suppose there\u2019s someone in my old rooms\u201d I asked at last when we had calmed\ndown somewhat.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d love to put up here again with you.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s face changed with startling suddenness.",
    "\u201cMon Dieu but what a chance \u00e9pouvantable.",
    "Regard around you my friend.\u201d\nFor the first time I took note of my surroundings.",
    "Against the wall stood a vast ark of a\ntrunk of prehistoric design.",
    "Near to it were placed a number of suitcases ranged neatly in\norder of size from large to small.",
    "The inference was unmistakable.",
    "\u201cYou are going away\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhere to\u201d\n\u201cSouth America.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cYes it is a droll farce is it not It is to Rio I go and every day I say to myself I will\nwrite nothing in my letters\u2014but oh the surprise of the good Hastings when he beholds me\u201d\n\u201cBut when are you going\u201d\nPoirot looked at his watch.",
    "\u201cIn an hour\u2019s time.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you always said nothing would induce you to make a long sea voyage\u201d\nPoirot closed his eyes and shuddered.",
    "\u201cSpeak not of it to me my friend.",
    "My doctor he assures me that one dies not of it\u2014and\nit is for the one time only you understand that never\u2014never shall I return.\u201d\nHe pushed me into a chair.",
    "\u201cCome I will tell you how it all came about.",
    "Do you know who is the richest man in\nthe world Richer even than Rockefeller Abe Ryland.\u201d\n\u201cThe American Soap King\u201d\n\n\f\u201cPrecisely.",
    "One of his secretaries approached me.",
    "There is some very considerable as\nyou would call it hocuspocus going on in connection with a big company in Rio.",
    "He\nwished me to investigate matters on the spot.",
    "I refused.",
    "I told him that if the facts were laid\nbefore me I would give him my expert opinion.",
    "But that he professed himself unable to do.",
    "I\nwas to be put in possession of the facts only on my arrival out there.",
    "Normally that would\nhave closed the matter.",
    "To dictate to Hercule Poirot is sheer impertinence.",
    "But the sum\noffered was so stupendous that for the first time in my life I was tempted by mere money.",
    "It\nwas a competence\u2014a fortune And there was a second attraction\u2014you my friend.",
    "For this\nlast year and a half I have been a very lonely old man.",
    "I thought to myself Why not I am\nbeginning to weary of this unending solving of foolish problems.",
    "I have achieved sufficient\nfame.",
    "Let me take this money and settle down somewhere near my old friend.\u201d\nI was quite affected by this token of Poirot\u2019s regard.",
    "\u201cSo I accepted\u201d he continued \u201cand in an hour\u2019s time I must leave to catch the boat\ntrain.",
    "One of life\u2019s little ironies is it not But I will admit to you Hastings that had not the\nmoney offered been so big I might have hesitated for just lately I have begun a little\ninvestigation of my own.",
    "Tell me what is commonly meant by the phrase \u2018The Big Four\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it had its origin at the Versailles Conference and then there\u2019s the famous\n\u2018Big Four\u2019 in the film world and the term is used by hosts of smaller fry.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI have come across the phrase you understand under\ncertain circumstances where none of those explanations would apply.",
    "It seems to refer to a\ngang of international criminals or something of that kind only\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOnly what\u201d I asked as he hesitated.",
    "\u201cOnly that I fancy that it is something on a large scale.",
    "Just a little idea of mine nothing\nmore.",
    "Ah but I must complete my packing.",
    "The time advances.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t go\u201d I urged.",
    "\u201cCancel your package and come out on the same boat with me.\u201d\nPoirot drew himself up and glanced at me reproachfully.",
    "\u201cAh is it that you don\u2019t understand I have passed my word you comprehend\u2014the\nword of Hercule Poirot.",
    "Nothing but a matter of life or death could detain me now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not likely to occur\u201d I murmured ruefully.",
    "\u201cUnless at the eleventh hour \u2018the\ndoor opens and the unexpected guest comes in.\u2019\u201d\nI quoted the old saw with a slight laugh and then in the pause that succeeded it we\nboth started as a sound came from the inner room.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cMa foi\u201d retorted Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt sounds very like your \u2018unexpected guest\u2019 in my\nbedroom.\u201d\n\u201cBut how can anyone be in there There\u2019s no door except into this room.\u201d\n\u201cYour memory is excellent Hastings.",
    "Now for the deductions.\u201d\n\u201cThe window But it\u2019s a burglar then He must have had a stiff climb of it\u2014I should\nsay it was almost impossible.\u201d\n\n\fI had risen to my feet and was striding in the direction of the door when the sound of\nfumbling at the handle from the other side arrested me.",
    "The door swung slowly open.",
    "Framed in the doorway stood a man.",
    "He was coated from\nhead to foot with dust and mud his face was thin and emaciated.",
    "He stared at us for a\nmoment and then swayed and fell.",
    "Poirot hurried to his side then he looked up and spoke to\nme.",
    "\u201cBrandy\u2014quickly.\u201d\nI dashed some brandy into a glass and brought it.",
    "Poirot managed to administer a little\nand together we raised him and carried him to the couch.",
    "In a few minutes he opened his\neyes and looked round him with an almost vacant stare.",
    "\u201cWhat is it you want monsieur\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "The man opened his lips and spoke in a queer mechanical voice.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Hercule Poirot 14 Farraway Street.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes I am he.\u201d\nThe man did not seem to understand and merely repeated in exactly the same tone\n\u201cM.",
    "Hercule Poirot 14 Farraway Street.\u201d\nPoirot tried him with several questions.",
    "Sometimes the man did not answer at all\nsometimes he repeated the same phrase.",
    "Poirot made a sign to me to ring up on the\ntelephone.",
    "\u201cGet Dr. Ridgeway to come round.\u201d\nThe doctor was in luckily and as his house was only just round the corner few\nminutes elapsed before he came bustling in.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s all this eh\u201d\nPoirot gave him a brief explanation and the doctor started examining our strange\nvisitor who seemed quite unconscious of his presence or ours.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said Dr. Ridgeway when he had finished.",
    "\u201cCurious case.\u201d\n\u201cBrain fever\u201d I suggested.",
    "The doctor immediately snorted with contempt.",
    "\u201cBrain fever Brain fever No such thing as brain fever.",
    "An invention of novelists.",
    "No\nthe man\u2019s had a shock of some kind.",
    "He\u2019s come here under the force of a persistent idea\u2014to\nfind M. Hercule Poirot 14 Farraway Street\u2014and he repeats those words mechanically\nwithout in the least knowing what they mean.\u201d\n\u201cAphasia\u201d I said eagerly.",
    "This suggestion did not cause the doctor to snort quite as violently as my last one had\ndone.",
    "He made no answer but handed the man a sheet of paper and a pencil.",
    "\u201cLet\u2019s see what he\u2019ll do with that\u201d he remarked.",
    "The man did nothing with it for some moments then he suddenly began to write\nfeverishly.",
    "With equal suddenness he stopped and let both paper and pencil fall to the\nground.",
    "The doctor picked it up and shook his head.",
    "\u201cNothing here.",
    "Only the figure 4 scrawled a dozen times each one bigger than the last.",
    "Wants to write 14 Farraway Street I expect.",
    "It\u2019s an interesting case\u2014very interesting.",
    "Can\nyou possibly keep him here until this afternoon I\u2019m due at the hospital now but I\u2019ll come\nback this afternoon and make all arrangements about him.",
    "It\u2019s too interesting a case to be\nlost sight of.\u201d\nI explained Poirot\u2019s departure and the fact that I proposed to accompany him to\nSouthampton.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all right.",
    "Leave the man here.",
    "He won\u2019t get into mischief.",
    "He\u2019s suffering from\ncomplete exhaustion.",
    "Will probably sleep for eight hours on end.",
    "I\u2019ll have a word with that\nexcellent Mrs. Funnyface of yours and tell her to keep an eye on him.\u201d\nAnd Dr. Ridgeway bustled out with his usual celerity.",
    "Poirot himself completed his\npacking with one eye on the clock.",
    "\u201cThe time it marches with a rapidity unbelievable.",
    "Come now Hastings you cannot\nsay that I have left you with nothing to do.",
    "A most sensational problem.",
    "The man from the\nunknown.",
    "Who is he What is he Ah sapristi but I would give two years of my life to\nhave this boat go tomorrow instead of today.",
    "There is something here very curious\u2014very\ninteresting.",
    "But one must have time\u2014time.",
    "It may be days\u2014or even months\u2014before he will\nbe able to tell us what he came to tell.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best Poirot\u201d I assured him.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll try to be an efficient substitute.\u201d\n\u201cYees.\u201d\nHis rejoinder struck me as being a shade doubtful.",
    "I picked up the sheet of paper.",
    "\u201cIf I were writing a story\u201d I said lightly \u201cI should weave this in with your latest\nidiosyncrasy and call it The Mystery of the Big Four.\u201d I tapped the pencilled figures as I\nspoke.",
    "And then I started for our invalid roused suddenly from his stupor sat up in his chair\nand said clearly and distinctly\n\u201cLi Chang Yen.\u201d\nHe had the look of a man suddenly awakened from sleep.",
    "Poirot made a sign to me not\nto speak.",
    "The man went on.",
    "He spoke in a clear high voice and something in his\nenunciation made me feel that he was quoting from some written report or lecture.",
    "\u201cLi Chang Yen may be regarded as representing the brains of the Big Four.",
    "He is the\ncontrolling and motive force.",
    "I have designated him therefore as Number One.",
    "Number\nTwo is seldom mentioned by name.",
    "He is represented by an \u2018S\u2019 with two lines through it\u2014\nthe sign for a dollar also by two stripes and a star.",
    "It may be conjectured therefore that he\nis an American subject and that he represents the power of wealth.",
    "There seems no doubt\nthat Number Three is a woman and her nationality French.",
    "It is possible that she may be one\nof the sirens of the demimonde but nothing is known definitely.",
    "Number Four\u2014\u201d\n\n\fHis voice faltered and broke.",
    "Poirot leant forward.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he prompted eagerly \u201cNumber Four\u201d\nHis eyes were fastened on the man\u2019s face.",
    "Some overmastering terror seemed to be\ngaining the day the features were distorted and twisted.",
    "\u201cThe destroyer\u201d gasped the man.",
    "Then with a final convulsed movement he fell back\nin a dead faint.",
    "\u201cMon Dieu\u201d whispered Poirot \u201cI was right then.",
    "I was right.\u201d\n\u201cYou think\u2014\u201d\nHe interrupted me.",
    "\u201cCarry him on to the bed in my room.",
    "I have not a minute to lose if I would catch my\ntrain.",
    "Not that I want to catch it.",
    "Oh that I could miss it with a clear conscience But I gave\nmy word.",
    "Come Hastings\u201d\nLeaving our mysterious visitor in the charge of Mrs. Pearson we drove away and duly\ncaught the train by the skin of our teeth.",
    "Poirot was alternately silent and loquacious.",
    "He\nwould sit staring out of the window like a man lost in a dream apparently not hearing a\nword that I said to him.",
    "Then reverting to animation suddenly he would shower injunctions\nand commands upon me and urge the necessity of constant marconigrams.",
    "We had a long fit of silence just after we passed Woking.",
    "The train of course did not\nstop anywhere until Southampton but just here it happened to be held up by a signal.",
    "\u201cAh Sacr\u00e9 mille tonnerres\u201d cried Poirot suddenly.",
    "\u201cBut I have been an imbecile.",
    "I\nsee clearly at last.",
    "It is undoubtedly the blessed saints who stopped the train.",
    "Jump\nHastings but jump I tell you.\u201d\nIn an instant he had unfastened the carriage door and jumped out on the line.",
    "\u201cThrow out the suitcases and jump yourself.\u201d\nI obeyed him.",
    "Just in time.",
    "As I alighted beside him the train moved on.",
    "\u201cAnd now Poirot\u201d I said in some exasperation \u201cperhaps you will tell me what all\nthis is about.\u201d\n\u201cIt is my friend that I have seen the light.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u201d I said \u201cis very illuminating to me.\u201d\n\u201cIt should be\u201d said Poirot \u201cbut I fear\u2014I very much fear that it is not.",
    "If you can carry\ntwo of these valises I think I can manage the rest.\u201d\n\n\fTwo\nTHE MAN FROM THE ASYLUM\n\nFortunately the train had stopped near a station.",
    "A short walk brought us to a garage where\nwe were able to obtain a car and half an hour later we were spinning rapidly back to\nLondon.",
    "Then and not till then did Poirot deign to satisfy my curiosity.",
    "\u201cYou do not see No more did I.",
    "But I see now.",
    "Hastings I was being got out of the\nway.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Very cleverly.",
    "Both the place and the method were chosen with great knowledge\nand acumen.",
    "They were afraid of me.\u201d\n\u201cWho were\u201d\n\u201cThose four geniuses who have banded themselves together to work outside the law.",
    "A\nChinaman an American a Frenchwoman and\u2014another.",
    "Pray the good God we arrive back\nin time Hastings.\u201d\n\u201cYou think there is danger to our visitor\u201d\n\u201cI am sure of it.\u201d\nMrs. Pearson greeted us on arrival.",
    "Brushing aside her ecstasies of astonishment on\nbeholding Poirot we asked for information.",
    "It was reassuring.",
    "No one had called and our\nguest had not made any sign.",
    "With a sigh of relief we went up to the rooms.",
    "Poirot crossed the outer one and went\nthrough to the inner one.",
    "Then he called me his voice strangely agitated.",
    "\u201cHastings he\u2019s dead.\u201d\nI came running to join him.",
    "The man was lying as we had left him but he was dead and\nhad been dead some time.",
    "I rushed out for a doctor.",
    "Ridgeway I knew would not have\nreturned yet.",
    "I found one almost immediately and brought him back with me.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s dead right enough poor chap.",
    "Tramp you\u2019ve been befriending eh\u201d\n\u201cSomething of the kind\u201d said Poirot evasively.",
    "\u201cWhat was the cause of death doctor\u201d\n\u201cHard to say.",
    "Might have been some kind of fit.",
    "There are signs of asphyxiation.",
    "No gas\nlaid on is there\u201d\n\u201cNo electric light\u2014nothing else.\u201d\n\u201cAnd both windows wide open too.",
    "Been dead about two hours I should say.",
    "You\u2019ll\nnotify the proper people won\u2019t you\u201d\nHe took his departure.",
    "Poirot did some necessary telephoning.",
    "Finally somewhat to my\n\n\fsurprise he rang up our old friend Inspector Japp and asked him if he could possibly come\nround.",
    "No sooner were these proceedings completed than Mrs. Pearson appeared her eyes as\nround as saucers.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a man here from \u2019Anwell\u2014from the \u2019Sylum.",
    "Did you ever Shall I show him\nup\u201d\nWe signified assent and a big burly man in uniform was ushered in.",
    "\u201c\u2019Morning gentlemen\u201d he said cheerfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got reason to believe you\u2019ve got one\nof my birds here.",
    "Escaped last night he did.\u201d\n\u201cHe was here\u201d said Poirot quietly.",
    "\u201cNot got away again has he\u201d asked the keeper with some concern.",
    "\u201cHe is dead.\u201d\nThe man looked more relieved than otherwise.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t say so.",
    "Well I dare say it\u2019s best for all parties.\u201d\n\u201cWas he\u2014dangerous\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Omicidal d\u2019you mean Oh no.",
    "\u2019Armless enough.",
    "Persecution mania very acute.",
    "Full\nof secret societies from China that had got him shut up.",
    "They\u2019re all the same.\u201d\nI shuddered.",
    "\u201cHow long has he been shut up\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cA matter of two years now.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Poirot quietly.",
    "\u201cIt never occurred to anybody that he might\u2014be sane\u201d\nThe keeper permitted himself to laugh.",
    "\u201cIf he was sane what would he be doing in a lunatic asylum They all say they\u2019re sane\nyou know.\u201d\nPoirot said no more.",
    "He took the man in to see the body.",
    "The identification came\nimmediately.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s him\u2014right enough\u201d said the keeper callously \u201cfunny sort of bloke ain\u2019t he\nWell gentlemen I had best go off now and make arrangements under the circumstances.",
    "We\nwon\u2019t trouble you with the corpse much longer.",
    "If there\u2019s a hinquest you will have to\nappear at it I dare say.",
    "Good morning sir.\u201d\nWith a rather uncouth bow he shambled out of the room.",
    "A few minutes later Japp arrived.",
    "The Scotland Yard inspector was jaunty and dapper\nas usual.",
    "\u201cHere I am Moosior Poirot.",
    "What can I do for you Thought you were off to the coral\nstrands of somewhere or other today\u201d\n\u201cMy good Japp I want to know if you have ever seen this man before.\u201d\n\n\fHe led Japp into the bedroom.",
    "The inspector stared down at the figure on the bed with a\npuzzled face.",
    "\u201cLet me see now\u2014he seems sort of familiar\u2014and I pride myself on my memory too.",
    "Why God bless my soul it\u2019s Mayerling\u201d\n\u201cSecret Service chap\u2014not one of our people.",
    "Went to Russia five years ago.",
    "Never\nheard of again.",
    "Always thought the Bolshies had done him in.\u201d\n\u201cIt all fits in\u201d said Poirot when Japp had taken his leave \u201cexcept for the fact that he\nseems to have died a natural death.\u201d\nHe stood looking down on the motionless figure with a dissatisfied frown.",
    "A puff of\nwind set the window curtains flying out and he looked up sharply.",
    "\u201cI suppose you opened the windows when you laid him down on the bed Hastings\u201d\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t\u201d I replied.",
    "\u201cAs far as I remember they were shut.\u201d\nPoirot lifted his head suddenly.",
    "\u201cShut\u2014and now they are open.",
    "What can that mean\u201d\n\u201cSomebody came in that way\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cPossibly\u201d agreed Poirot but he spoke absently and without conviction.",
    "After a minute\nor two he said\n\u201cThat is not exactly the point I had in mind Hastings.",
    "If only one window was open it\nwould not intrigue me so much.",
    "It is both windows being open that strikes me as curious.\u201d\nHe hurried into the other room.",
    "\u201cThe sittingroom window is open too.",
    "That also we left shut.",
    "Ah\u201d\nHe bent over the dead man examining the corners of the mouth minutely.",
    "Then he\nlooked up suddenly.",
    "\u201cHe has been gagged Hastings.",
    "Gagged and then poisoned.\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens\u201d I exclaimed shocked.",
    "\u201cI suppose we shall find out all about it from\nthe postmortem.\u201d\n\u201cWe shall find out nothing.",
    "He was killed by inhaling strong prussic acid.",
    "It was\njammed right under his nose.",
    "Then the murderer went away again first opening all the\nwindows.",
    "Hydrocyanic acid is exceedingly volatile but it has a pronounced smell of bitter\nalmonds.",
    "With no trace of the smell to guide them and no suspicion of foul play death\nwould be put down to some natural cause by the doctors.",
    "So this man was in the Secret\nService Hastings.",
    "And five years ago he disappeared in Russia.\u201d\n\u201cThe last two years he\u2019s been in the asylum\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cBut what of the three years before\nthat\u201d\nPoirot shook his head and then caught my arm.",
    "\u201cThe clock Hastings look at the clock.\u201d\n\n\fI followed his gaze to the mantelpiece.",
    "The clock had stopped at four o\u2019clock.",
    "\u201cMon ami someone has tampered with it.",
    "It had still three days to run.",
    "It is an eightday\nclock you comprehend\u201d\n\u201cBut what should they want to do that for Some idea of a false scent by making the\ncrime appear to have taken place at four o\u2019clock\u201d\n\u201cNo no rearrange your ideas mon ami.",
    "Exercise your little grey cells.",
    "You are\nMayerling.",
    "You hear something perhaps\u2014and you know well enough that your doom is\nsealed.",
    "You have just time to leave a sign.",
    "Four o\u2019clock Hastings.",
    "Number Four the\ndestroyer.",
    "Ah an idea\u201d\nHe rushed into the other room and seized the telephone.",
    "He asked for Hanwell.",
    "\u201cYou are the asylum yes I understand there has been an escape today What is that\nyou say A little moment if you please.",
    "Will you repeat that Ah parfaitement.\u201d\nHe hung up the receiver and turned to me.",
    "\u201cYou heard Hastings There has been no escape.\u201d\n\u201cBut the man who came\u2014the keeper\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI wonder\u2014I very much wonder.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNumber Four\u2014the destroyer.\u201d\nI gazed at Poirot dumbfounded.",
    "A minute or two after on recovering my voice I said\n\u201cWe shall know him again anywhere that\u2019s one thing.",
    "He was a man of very\npronounced personality.\u201d\n\u201cWas he mon ami I think not.",
    "He was burly and bluff and redfaced with a thick\nmoustache and a hoarse voice.",
    "He will be none of those things by this time and for the rest\nhe has nondescript eyes nondescript ears and a perfect set of false teeth.",
    "Identification is\nnot such an easy matter as you seem to think.",
    "Next time\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou think there will be a next time\u201d I interrupted.",
    "Poirot\u2019s face grew very grave.",
    "\u201cIt is a duel to the death mon ami.",
    "You and I on the one side the Big Four on the other.",
    "They have won the first trick but they have failed in their plan to get me out of the way and\nin the future they have to reckon with Hercule Poirot\u201d\n\n\fThree\nWE HEAR MORE ABOUT LI CHANG YEN\n\nFor a day or two after our visit from the fake asylum attendant I was in some hopes that he\nmight return and I refused to leave the flat even for a moment.",
    "As far as I could see he had\nno reason to suspect that we had penetrated his disguise.",
    "He might I thought return and try\nto remove the body but Poirot scoffed at my reasoning.",
    "\u201cMon ami\u201d he said \u201cif you wish you may wait in to put salt on the little bird\u2019s tail but\nfor me I do not waste my time so.\u201d\n\u201cWell then Poirot\u201d I argued \u201cwhy did he run the risk of coming at all If he intended\nto return later for the body I can see some point in his visit.",
    "He would at least be removing\nthe evidence against himself as it is he does not seem to have gained anything.\u201d\nPoirot shrugged his most Gallic shrug.",
    "\u201cBut you do not see with the eyes of Number\nFour Hastings\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou talk of evidence but what evidence have we against him\nTrue we have a body but we have no proof even that the man was murdered\u2014prussic acid\nwhen inhaled leaves no trace.",
    "Again we can find no one who saw anyone enter the flat\nduring our absence and we have found out nothing about the movements of our late friend\nMayerling \u2026\n\u201cNo Hastings Number Four has left no trace and he knows it.",
    "His visit we may call a\nreconnaissance.",
    "Perhaps he wanted to make quite sure that Mayerling was dead but more\nlikely I think he came to see Hercule Poirot and to have speech with the adversary whom\nalone he must fear.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s reasoning appeared to be typically egotistical but I forebore to argue.",
    "\u201cAnd what about the inquest\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cI suppose you will explain things clearly there\nand let the police have a full description of Number Four.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to what end Can we produce anything to impress a coroner\u2019s jury of your solid\nBritishers Is our description of Number Four of any value No we shall allow them to call\nit \u2018Accidental Death\u2019 and maybe although I have not much hope our clever murderer will\npat himself on the back that he deceived Hercule Poirot in the first round.\u201d\nPoirot was right as usual.",
    "We saw no more of the man from the asylum and the inquest\nat which I gave evidence but which Poirot did not even attend aroused no public interest.",
    "As in view of his intended trip to South America Poirot had wound up his affairs\nbefore my arrival he had at this time no cases in hand but although he spent most of his\ntime in the flat I could get little out of him.",
    "He remained buried in an armchair and\ndiscouraged my attempts at conversation.",
    "And then one morning about a week after the murder he asked me if I would care to\naccompany him on a visit he wished to make.",
    "I was pleased for I felt he was making a\n\n\fmistake in trying to work things out so entirely on his own and I wished to discuss the case\nwith him.",
    "But I found he was not communicative.",
    "Even when I asked where we were going\nhe would not answer.",
    "Poirot loves being mysterious.",
    "He will never part with a piece of information until the\nlast possible moment.",
    "In this instance having taken successively a bus and two trains and\narrived in the neighbourhood of one of London\u2019s most depressing southern suburbs he\nconsented at last to explain matters.",
    "\u201cWe go Hastings to see the one man in England who knows most of the underground\nlife of China.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed Who is he\u201d\n\u201cA man you have never heard of\u2014a Mr. John Ingles.",
    "To all intents and purposes he is\na retired Civil Servant of mediocre intellect with a house full of Chinese curios with which\nhe bores his friends and acquaintances.",
    "Nevertheless I am assured by those who should\nknow that the only man capable of giving me the information I seek is this same John\nIngles.\u201d\nA few moments more saw us ascending the steps of The Laurels as Mr. Ingles\u2019s\nresidence was called.",
    "Personally I did not notice a laurel bush of any kind so deduced that\nit had been named according to the usual obscure nomenclature of the suburbs.",
    "We were admitted by an impassivefaced Chinese servant and ushered into the\npresence of his master.",
    "Mr. Ingles was a squarely built man somewhat yellow of\ncountenance with deepset eyes that were oddly reflective in character.",
    "He rose to greet us\nsetting aside an open letter which he had held in his hand.",
    "He referred to it after his\ngreeting.",
    "\u201cSit down won\u2019t you Hasley tells me that you want some information and that I may\nbe useful to you in the matter.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so monsieur.",
    "I ask of you if you have any knowledge of a man named Li Chang\nYen\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s rum\u2014very rum indeed.",
    "How did you come to hear about the man\u201d\n\u201cYou know him then\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve met him once.",
    "And I know something of him\u2014not quite as much as I should like\nto.",
    "But it surprises me that anyone else in England should even have heard of him.",
    "He\u2019s a\ngreat man in his way\u2014mandarin class and all that you know\u2014but that\u2019s not the crux of the\nmatter.",
    "There\u2019s good reason to suppose that he\u2019s the man behind it all.\u201d\n\u201cBehind what\u201d\n\u201cEverything.",
    "The worldwide unrest the labour troubles that beset every nation and the\nrevolutions that break out in some.",
    "There are people not scaremongers who know what\nthey are talking about and they say that there is a force behind the scenes which aims at\nnothing less than the disintegration of civilization.",
    "In Russia you know there were many\nsigns that Lenin and Trotsky were mere puppets whose every action was dictated by\nanother\u2019s brain.",
    "I have no definite proof that would count with you but I am quite convinced\n\n\fthat this brain was Li Chang Yen\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOh come\u201d I protested \u201cisn\u2019t that a bit farfetched How would a Chinaman cut any\nice in Russia\u201d\nPoirot frowned at me irritably.",
    "\u201cFor you Hastings\u201d he said \u201ceverything is farfetched that comes not from your own\nimagination for me I agree with this gentleman.",
    "But continue I pray monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cWhat exactly he hopes to get out of it all I cannot pretend to say for certain\u201d went on\nMr. Ingles \u201cbut I assume his disease is one that has attacked great brains from the time of\nAkbar and Alexander to Napoleon\u2014a lust for power and personal supremacy.",
    "Up to\nmodern times armed force was necessary for conquest but in this century of unrest a man\nlike Li Chang Yen can use other means.",
    "I have evidence that he has unlimited money behind\nhim for bribery and propaganda and there are signs that he controls some scientific force\nmore powerful than the world has dreamed of.\u201d\nPoirot was following Mr. Ingles\u2019s words with the closest attention.",
    "\u201cAnd in China\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cHe moves there too\u201d\nThe other nodded in emphatic assent.",
    "\u201cThere\u201d he said \u201calthough I can produce no proof that would count in a court of law I\nspeak from my own knowledge.",
    "I know personally every man who counts for anything in\nChina today and this I can tell you the men who loom most largely in the public eye are\nmen of little or no personality.",
    "They are marionettes who dance to the wires pulled by a\nmaster hand and that hand is Li Chang Yen\u2019s.",
    "His is the controlling brain of the East today.",
    "We don\u2019t understand the East\u2014we never shall but Li Chang Yen is its moving spirit.",
    "Not\nthat he comes out into the limelight\u2014oh not at all he never moves from his palace in\nPeking.",
    "But he pulls strings\u2014that\u2019s it pulls strings\u2014and things happen far away.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there is no one to oppose him\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "Mr. Ingles leant forward in his chair.",
    "\u201cFour men have tried in the last four years\u201d he said slowly \u201cmen of character and\nhonesty and brain power.",
    "Any one of them might in time have interfered with his plans.\u201d He\npaused.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d I queried.",
    "\u201cWell they are dead.",
    "One wrote an article and mentioned Li Chang Yen\u2019s name in\nconnection with the riots in Peking and within two days he was stabbed in the street.",
    "His\nmurderer was never caught.",
    "The offences of the other two were similar.",
    "In a speech or an\narticle or in conversation each linked Li Chang Yen\u2019s name with rioting or revolution and\nwithin a week of his indiscretion each was dead.",
    "One was poisoned one died of cholera an\nisolated case\u2014not part of an epidemic and one was found dead in his bed.",
    "The cause of the\nlast death was never determined but I was told by a doctor who saw the corpse that it was\nburnt and shrivelled as though a wave of electrical energy of incredible power had passed\nthrough it.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd Li Chang Yen\u201d inquired Poirot.",
    "\u201cNaturally nothing is traced to him but there are\nsigns eh\u201d\nMr. Ingles shrugged.",
    "\u201cOh signs\u2014yes certainly.",
    "And once I found a man who would talk a brilliant young\nChinese chemist who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Li Chang Yen\u2019s.",
    "He came to me one day this\nchemist and I could see that he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.",
    "He hinted to me\nof experiments on which he\u2019d been engaged in Li Chang Yen\u2019s palace under the mandarin\u2019s\ndirection\u2014experiments on coolies in which the most revolting disregard for human life and\nsuffering had been shown.",
    "His nerve had completely broken and he was in the most pitiable\nstate of terror.",
    "I put him to bed in a top room of my own house intending to question him the\nnext day\u2014and that of course was stupid of me.\u201d\n\u201cHow did they get him\u201d demanded Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat I shall never know.",
    "I woke that night to find my house in flames and was lucky to\nescape with my life.",
    "Investigation showed that a fire of amazing intensity had broken out on\nthe top floor and the remains of my young chemist friend were charred to a cinder.\u201d\nI could see from the earnestness with which he had been speaking that Mr. Ingles was a\nman mounted on his hobby horse and evidently he too realized that he had been carried\naway for he laughed apologetically.",
    "\u201cBut of course\u201d he said \u201cI have no proofs and you like the others will merely tell\nme that I have a bee in my bonnet.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary\u201d said Poirot quietly \u201cwe have every reason to believe your story.",
    "We\nourselves are more than a little interested in Li Chang Yen.\u201d\n\u201cVery odd your knowing about him.",
    "Didn\u2019t fancy a soul in England had ever heard of\nhim.",
    "I\u2019d rather like to know how you did come to hear of him\u2014if it\u2019s not indiscreet.\u201d\n\u201cNot in the least monsieur.",
    "A man took refuge in my rooms.",
    "He was suffering badly\nfrom shock but he managed to tell us enough to interest us in this Li Chang Yen.",
    "He\ndescribed four people\u2014the Big Four\u2014an organisation hitherto undreamed of.",
    "Number One\nis Li Chang Yen Number Two is an unknown American Number Three an equally unknown\nFrenchwoman Number Four may be called the executive of the organization\u2014the\ndestroyer.",
    "My informant died.",
    "Tell me monsieur is that phrase known to you at all The\nBig Four.\u201d\n\u201cNot in connection with Li Chang Yen.",
    "No I can\u2019t say it is.",
    "But I\u2019ve heard it or read it\njust lately\u2014and in some unusual connection too.",
    "Ah I\u2019ve got it.\u201d\nHe rose and went across to an inlaid lacquer cabinet\u2014an exquisite thing as even I\ncould see.",
    "He returned with a letter in his hand.",
    "\u201cHere you are.",
    "Note from an old seafaring man I ran against once in Shanghai.",
    "Hoary\nold reprobate\u2014maudlin with drink by now I should say.",
    "I took this to be the ravings of\nalcoholism.\u201d\nHe read it aloud\n\n\fDear Sir\u2014You may not remember me but you did me a good turn once in\nShanghai.",
    "Do me another now.",
    "I must have money to get out of the country.",
    "I\u2019m\nwell hid here I hope but any day they may get me.",
    "The Big Four I mean.",
    "It\u2019s\nlife or death.",
    "I\u2019ve plenty of money but I daren\u2019t get at it for fear of putting them\nwise.",
    "Send me a couple of hundred in notes.",
    "I\u2019ll repay it faithful\u2014I swear to\nthat.\u2014\nYour servant sir\nJonathan Whalley\n\u201cDated from Granite Bungalow Hoppaton Dartmoor.",
    "I\u2019m afraid I regarded it as rather a\ncrude method of relieving me of a couple of hundred which I can ill spare.",
    "If it\u2019s any use to\nyou\u2014\u201d He held it out.",
    "\u201cJe vous remercie monsieur.",
    "I start for Hoppaton \u00e0 l\u2019heure m\u00eame.\u201d\n\u201cDear me this is very interesting.",
    "Supposing I came along too Any objection\u201d\n\u201cI should be charmed to have your company but we must start at once.",
    "We shall not\nreach Dartmoor until close on nightfall as it is.\u201d\nJohn Ingles did not delay us more than a couple of minutes and soon we were in the\ntrain moving out of Paddington bound for the West Country.",
    "Hoppaton was a small village\nclustering in a hollow right on the fringe of the moorland.",
    "It was reached by a ninemile\ndrive from Moretonhampstead.",
    "It was about eight o\u2019clock when we arrived but as the\nmonth was July the daylight was still abundant.",
    "We drove into the narrow street of the village and then stopped to ask our way of an\nold rustic.",
    "\u201cGranite Bungalow\u201d said the old man reflectively \u201cit be Granite Bungalow you do\nwant Eh\u201d\nWe assured him that this was what we did want.",
    "The old man pointed to a small grey cottage at the end of the street.",
    "\u201cThere be t\u2019Bungalow.",
    "Do yee want to see t\u2019Inspector\u201d\n\u201cWhat Inspector\u201d asked Poirot sharply \u201cwhat do you mean\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t yee heard about t\u2019murder then A shocking business t\u2019was seemingly.",
    "Pools\nof blood they do say.\u201d\n\u201cMon Dieu\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cThis Inspector of yours I must see him at once.\u201d\nFive minutes later we were closeted with Inspector Meadows.",
    "The Inspector was\ninclined to be stiff at first but at the magic name of Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard he\nunbent.",
    "\u201cYes sir murdered this morning.",
    "A shocking business.",
    "They phoned to Moreton and I\ncame out at once.",
    "Looked a mysterious thing to begin with.",
    "The old man\u2014he was about\nseventy you know and fond of his glass from all I hear\u2014was lying on the floor of the\nliving room.",
    "There was a bruise on his head and his throat was cut from ear to ear.",
    "Blood\nall over the place as you can understand.",
    "The woman who cooks for him Betsy Andrews\n\n\fshe told us that her master had several little Chinese jade figures that he\u2019d told her were\nvery valuable and these had disappeared.",
    "That of course looked like assault and robbery\nbut there were all sorts of difficulties in the way of that solution.",
    "The old fellow had two\npeople in the house Betsy Andrews who is a Hoppaton woman and a rough kind of\nmanservant Robert Grant.",
    "Grant had gone to the farm to fetch the milk which he does every\nday and Betsy had stepped out to have a chat with a neighbour.",
    "She was only away twenty\nminutes\u2014between ten and half past\u2014and the crime must have been done then.",
    "Grant\nreturned to the house first.",
    "He went in by the back door which was open\u2014no one locks up\ndoors round here\u2014not in broad daylight at all events\u2014put the milk in the larder and went\ninto his own room to read the paper and have a smoke.",
    "He had no idea anything unusual had\noccurred\u2014at least that\u2019s what he says.",
    "Then Betsy comes in goes into the living room sees\nwhat\u2019s happened and lets out a screech to wake the dead.",
    "That\u2019s all fair and square.",
    "Someone got in whilst those two were out and did the poor old man in.",
    "But it struck me at\nonce that he must be a pretty cool customer.",
    "He\u2019d have to come right up the village street or\ncreep through someone\u2019s back yard.",
    "Granite Bungalow has got houses all round it as you\ncan see.",
    "How was it that no one had seen him\u201d\nThe Inspector paused with a flourish.",
    "\u201cAha I perceive your point\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cTo continue\u201d\n\u201cWell sir fishy I said to myself\u2014fishy.",
    "And I began to look about me.",
    "Those jade\nfigures now.",
    "Would a common tramp ever suspect that they were valuable Anyway it was\nmadness to try such a thing in broad daylight.",
    "Suppose the old man had yelled for help\u201d\n\u201cI suppose Inspector\u201d said Mr. Ingles \u201cthat the bruise on the head was inflicted\nbefore death\u201d\n\u201cQuite right sir.",
    "First knocked him silly the murderer did and then cut his throat.",
    "That\u2019s clear enough.",
    "But how the dickens did he come or go They notice strangers quick\nenough in a little place like this.",
    "It came to me all at once\u2014nobody did come.",
    "I took a good\nlook round.",
    "It had rained the night before and there were footprints clear enough going in\nand out of the kitchen.",
    "In the living room there were two sets of footprints only Betsy\nAndrews\u2019s stopped at the door\u2014Mr.",
    "Whalley\u2019s he was wearing carpet slippers and\nanother man\u2019s.",
    "The other man had stepped in the bloodstains and I traced his bloody\nfootprints\u2014I beg your pardon sir.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all\u201d said Mr. Ingles with a faint smile \u201cthe adjective is perfectly understood.\u201d\n\u201cI traced them to the kitchen\u2014but not beyond.",
    "Point Number One.",
    "On the lintel of\nRobert Grant\u2019s door was a faint smear\u2014a smear of blood.",
    "That\u2019s point Number Two.",
    "Point\nNumber Three was when I got hold of Grant\u2019s boots\u2014which he had taken off\u2014and fitted\nthem to the marks.",
    "That settled it.",
    "It was an inside job.",
    "I warned Grant and took him into\ncustody and what do you think I found packed away in his portmanteau The little jade\nfigures and a ticketofleave.",
    "Robert Grant was also Abraham Biggs convicted for felony\nand housebreaking five years ago.\u201d\nThe Inspector paused triumphantly.",
    "\u201cWhat do you think of that gentlemen\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI think\u201d said Poirot \u201cthat it appears a very clear case\u2014of a surprising clearness in\nfact.",
    "This Biggs or Grant he must be a man very foolish and uneducated eh\u201d\n\u201cOh he is that\u2014a rough common sort of fellow.",
    "No idea of what a footprint may\nmean.\u201d\n\u201cClearly he reads not the detective fiction Well Inspector I congratulate you.",
    "We may\nlook at the scene of the crime.",
    "Yes\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you there myself this minute.",
    "I\u2019d like you to see those footprints.\u201d\n\u201cI too should like to see them.",
    "Yes yes very interesting very ingenious.\u201d\nWe set out forthwith.",
    "Mr. Ingles and the Inspector forged ahead.",
    "I drew Poirot back a\nlittle so as to be able to speak to him out of the Inspector\u2019s hearing.",
    "\u201cWhat do you really think Poirot Is there more in this than meets the eye\u201d\n\u201cThat is just the question mon ami.",

    "Yet everything seems to say that this man Grant committed the crime.",
    "Why did he\ndo so For the sake of the little jade figures Or is he an agent of the Big Four I confess\nthat this last seems more likely.",
    "However valuable the jade a man of that class was not\nlikely to realize the fact\u2014at any rate not to the point of committing murder for them.",
    "That\npar example ought to have struck the Inspector.",
    "He could have stolen the jade and made\noff with it instead of committing a brutal murder.",
    "Ah yes I fear our Devonshire friend has\nnot used his little grey cells.",
    "He has measured footprints and has omitted to reflect and\narrange his ideas with the necessary order and method.\u201d\n\n\fFour\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF A LEG OF MUTTON\n\nThe Inspector drew a key from his pocket and unlocked the door of Granite Bungalow.",
    "The\nday had been fine and dry so our feet were not likely to leave any prints nevertheless we\nwiped them carefully on the mat before entering.",
    "A woman came up out of the gloom and spoke to the Inspector and he turned aside.",
    "Then he spoke over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cHave a good look round Mr. Poirot and see all there is to be seen.",
    "I\u2019ll be back in\nabout ten minutes.",
    "By the way here\u2019s Grant\u2019s boot.",
    "I brought it along with me for you to\ncompare the impressions.\u201d\nWe went into the living room and the sound of the Inspector\u2019s footsteps died away\noutside.",
    "Ingles was attracted immediately by some Chinese curios on a table in the corner\nand went over to examine them.",
    "He seemed to take no interest in Poirot\u2019s doings.",
    "I on the\nother hand watched him with breathless interest.",
    "The floor was covered with a darkgreen\nlinoleum which was ideal for showing up footprints.",
    "A door at the farther end led into the\nsmall kitchen.",
    "From there another door led into the scullery where the back door was\nsituated and another into the bedroom which had been occupied by Robert Grant.",
    "Having\nexplored the ground Poirot commented upon it in a low running monologue.",
    "\u201cHere is where the body lay that big dark stain and the splashes all around mark the\nspot.",
    "Traces of carpet slippers and \u2018number nine\u2019 boots you observe but all very confused.",
    "Then two sets of tracks leading to and from the kitchen whoever the murderer was he came\nin that way.",
    "You have the boot Hastings Give it to me.\u201d He compared it carefully with the\nprints.",
    "\u201cYes both made by the same man Robert Grant.",
    "He came in that way killed the old\nman and went back to the kitchen.",
    "He had stepped in the blood see the stains he left as he\nwent out Nothing to be seen in the kitchen\u2014all the village has been walking about in it.",
    "He\nwent into his own room\u2014no first he went back again to the scene of the crime\u2014was that to\nget the little jade figures Or had he forgotten something that might incriminate him\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he killed the old man the second time he went in\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cMais non you do not observe.",
    "On one of the outgoing footmarks stained with blood\nthere is superimposed an ingoing one.",
    "I wonder what he went back for\u2014the little jade\nfigures as an afterthought It is all ridiculous\u2014stupid.\u201d\n\u201cWell he\u2019s given himself away pretty hopelessly.\u201d\n\u201cN\u2019estce pas I tell you Hastings it goes against reason.",
    "It offends my little grey\ncells.",
    "Let us go into his bedroom\u2014ah yes there is the smear of blood on the lintel and just\na trace of footmarks\u2014bloodstained.",
    "Robert Grant\u2019s footmarks and his only near the body\n\u2014Robert Grant the only man who went near the house.",
    "Yes it must be so.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat about the old woman\u201d I said suddenly.",
    "\u201cShe was in the house alone after Grant\nhad gone for the milk.",
    "She might have killed him and then gone out.",
    "Her feet would leave no\nprints if she hadn\u2019t been outside.\u201d\n\u201cVery good Hastings.",
    "I wondered whether that hypothesis would occur to you.",
    "I had\nalready thought of it and rejected it.",
    "Betsy Andrews is a local woman wellknown\nhereabouts.",
    "She can have no connection with the Big Four and besides old Whalley was a\npowerful fellow by all accounts.",
    "This is a man\u2019s work\u2014not a woman\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose the Big Four couldn\u2019t have had some diabolical contrivance concealed in\nthe ceiling\u2014something which descended automatically and cut the old man\u2019s throat and was\nafterwards drawn up again\u201d\n\u201cLike Jacob\u2019s ladder I know Hastings that you have an imagination of the most fertile\n\u2014but I implore of you to keep it within bounds.\u201d\nI subsided abashed.",
    "Poirot continued to wander about poking into rooms and\ncupboards with a profoundly dissatisfied expression on his face.",
    "Suddenly he uttered an\nexcited yelp reminiscent of a Pomeranian dog.",
    "I rushed to join him.",
    "He was standing in the\nlarder in a dramatic attitude.",
    "In his hand he was brandishing a leg of mutton\n\u201cMy dear Poirot\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cWhat is the matter Have you suddenly gone mad\u201d\n\u201cRegard I pray you this mutton.",
    "But regard it closely\u201d\nI regarded it as closely as I could but could see nothing unusual about it.",
    "It seemed to\nme a very ordinary leg of mutton.",
    "I said as much.",
    "Poirot threw me a withering glance.",
    "\u201cBut do you not see this\u2014and this\u2014and this\u2014\u201d\nHe illustrated each \u201cthis\u201d with a jab at the unoffending joint dislodging small icicles as\nhe did so.",
    "Poirot had just accused me of being imaginative but I now felt that he was far more\nwildly so than I had ever been.",
    "Did he seriously think these slivers of ice were crystals of a\ndeadly poison That was the only construction I could put upon his extraordinary agitation.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s frozen meat\u201d I explained gently.",
    "\u201cImported you know.",
    "New Zealand.\u201d\nHe stared at me for a moment or two and then broke into a strange laugh.",
    "\u201cHow marvellous is my friend Hastings He knows everything\u2014but everything How\ndo they say\u2014Inquire Within Upon Everything.",
    "That is my friend Hastings.\u201d\nHe flung down the leg of mutton on to its dish again and left the larder.",
    "Then he looked\nthrough the window.",
    "\u201cHere comes our friend the Inspector.",
    "It is well.",
    "I have seen all I want to see here.\u201d He\ndrummed on the table absentmindedly as though absorbed in calculation and then asked\nsuddenly \u201cWhat is the day of the week mon ami\u201d\n\u201cMonday\u201d I said rather astonished.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh Monday is it A bad day of the week.",
    "To commit a murder on a Monday is a\nmistake.\u201d\n\n\fPassing back to the living room he tapped the glass on the wall and glanced at the\nthermometer.",
    "\u201cSet fair and seventy degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "An orthodox English summer\u2019s day.\u201d\nIngles was still examining various pieces of Chinese pottery.",
    "\u201cYou do not take much interest in this inquiry monsieur\u201d said Poirot.",
    "The other gave a slow smile.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not my job you see.",
    "I\u2019m a connoisseur of some things but not of this.",
    "So I just\nstand back and keep out of the way.",
    "I\u2019ve learnt patience in the East.\u201d\nThe Inspector came bustling in apologizing for having been so long away.",
    "He insisted\non taking us over most of the ground again but finally we got away.",
    "\u201cI must appreciate your thousand politenesses Inspector\u201d said Poirot as we were\nwalking down the village street again.",
    "\u201cThere is just one more request I should like to put to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to see the body perhaps sir\u201d\n\u201cOh dear me no I have not the least interest in the body.",
    "I want to see Robert Grant.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to drive back with me to Moreton to see him sir.\u201d\n\u201cVery well I will do so.",
    "But I must see him and be able to speak to him alone.\u201d\nThe Inspector caressed his upper lip.",
    "\u201cWell I don\u2019t know about that sir.\u201d\n\u201cI assure you that if you can get through to Scotland Yard you will receive full\nauthority.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of you of course sir and I know you\u2019ve done us a good turn now and\nagain.",
    "But it\u2019s very irregular.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless it is necessary\u201d said Poirot calmly.",
    "\u201cIt is necessary for this reason\u2014\nGrant is not the murderer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat Who is then\u201d\n\u201cThe murderer was I should fancy a youngish man.",
    "He drove up to Granite Bungalow\nin a trap which he left outside.",
    "He went in committed the murder came out and drove\naway again.",
    "He was bareheaded and his clothing was slightly bloodstained.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014but the whole village would have seen him\u201d\n\u201cNot under certain circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cNot if it was dark perhaps but the crime was committed in broad daylight.\u201d\nPoirot merely smiled.",
    "\u201cAnd the horse and trap sir\u2014how could you tell that Any amount of wheeled vehicles\nhave passed along outside.",
    "There\u2019s no mark of one in particular to be seen.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNot with the eyes of the body perhaps but with the eyes of the mind yes.\u201d\nThe Inspector touched his forehead significantly with a grin at me.",
    "I was utterly\nbewildered but I had faith in Poirot.",
    "Further discussion ended in our all driving back to\nMoreton with the Inspector.",
    "Poirot and I were taken to Grant but a constable was to be\npresent during the interview.",
    "Poirot went straight to the point.",
    "\u201cGrant I know you to be innocent of this crime.",
    "Relate to me in your own words\nexactly what happened.\u201d\nThe prisoner was a man of medium height with a somewhat unpleasing cast of features.",
    "He looked a jailbird if ever a man did.",
    "\u201cHonest to God I never did it\u201d he whined.",
    "\u201cSomeone put those little glass figures\namongst my traps.",
    "It was a frameup that\u2019s what it was.",
    "I went straight to my rooms when I\ncame in like I said.",
    "I never knew a thing till Betsy screeched out.",
    "S\u2019welp me God I\ndidn\u2019t.\u201d\nPoirot rose.",
    "\u201cIf you can\u2019t tell me the truth that is the end of it.\u201d\n\u201cBut guv\u2019nor\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou did go into the room\u2014you did know your master was dead and you were just\npreparing to make a bolt of it when the good Betsy made her terrible discovery.\u201d\nThe man stared at Poirot with a dropped jaw.",
    "\u201cCome now is it not so I tell you solemnly\u2014on my word of honour\u2014that to be frank\nnow is your only chance.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll risk it\u201d said the man suddenly.",
    "\u201cIt was just as you say.",
    "I came in and went straight\nto the master\u2014and there he was dead on the floor and blood all round.",
    "Then I got the wind\nup proper.",
    "They\u2019d ferret out my record and for a certainty they\u2019d say it was me as had done\nhim in.",
    "My only thought was to get away\u2014at once\u2014before he was found\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd the jade figures\u201d\nThe man hesitated.",
    "\u201cYou see\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou took them by a kind of reversion to instinct as it were You had heard your\nmaster say that they were valuable and you felt you might as well go the whole hog.",
    "That I\nunderstand.",
    "Now answer me this.",
    "Was it the second time that you went into the room that\nyou took the figures\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go in a second time.",
    "Once was enough for me.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure of that\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely certain.\u201d\n\u201cGood.",
    "Now when did you come out of prison\u201d\n\u201cTwo months ago.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cHow did you obtain this job\u201d\n\u201cThrough one of them Prisoners\u2019 Help Societies.",
    "Bloke met me when I came out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was he like\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly a parson but looked like one.",
    "Soft black hat and mincing way of walking.",
    "Got a broken front tooth.",
    "Spectacled chap.",
    "Saunders his name was.",
    "Said he hoped I was\nrepentant and that he\u2019d find me a good post.",
    "I went to old Whalley on his recommendation.\u201d\nPoirot rose once more.",
    "\u201cI thank you.",
    "I know all now.",
    "Have patience.\u201d He paused in the doorway and added\n\u201cSaunders gave you a pair of boots didn\u2019t he\u201d\nGrant looked very astonished.",
    "\u201cWhy yes he did.",
    "But how did you know\u201d\n\u201cIt is my business to know things\u201d said Poirot gravely.",
    "After a word or two to the Inspector the three of us went to the White Hart and\ndiscussed eggs and bacon and Devonshire cider.",
    "\u201cAny elucidations yet\u201d asked Ingles with a smile.",
    "\u201cYes the case is clear enough now but see you I shall have a good deal of difficulty\nin proving it.",
    "Whalley was killed by order of the Big Four\u2014but not by Grant.",
    "A very clever\nman got Grant the post and deliberately planned to make him the scapegoat\u2014an easy matter\nwith Grant\u2019s prison record.",
    "He gave him a pair of boots one of two duplicate pairs.",
    "The\nother he kept himself.",
    "It was all so simple.",
    "When Grant is out of the house and Betsy is\nchatting in the village which she probably did every day of her life he drives up wearing\nthe duplicate boots enters the kitchen goes through into the living room fells the old man\nwith a blow and then cuts his throat.",
    "Then he returns to the kitchen removes the boots puts\non another pair and carrying the first pair goes out to his trap and drives off again.\u201d\nIngles looks steadily at Poirot.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a catch in it still.",
    "Why did nobody see him\u201d\n\u201cAh That is where the cleverness of Number Four I am convinced comes in.",
    "Everybody saw him\u2014and yet nobody saw him.",
    "You see he drove up in a butcher\u2019s cart\u201d\nI uttered an exclamation.",
    "\u201cThe leg of mutton\u201d\n\u201cExactly Hastings the leg of mutton.",
    "Everybody swore that no one had been to Granite\nBungalow that morning but nevertheless I found in the larder a leg of mutton still frozen.",
    "It\nwas Monday so the meat must have been delivered that morning for if on Saturday in this\nhot weather it would not have remained frozen over Sunday.",
    "So someone had been to the\nBungalow and a man on whom a trace of blood here and there would attract no attention.\u201d\n\u201cDamned ingenious\u201d cried Ingles approvingly.",
    "\u201cYes he is clever Number Four.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAs clever as Hercule Poirot\u201d I murmured.",
    "My friend threw me a glance of dignified reproach.",

    "\u201cHave I not saved an innocent man from being sent to the gallows That is\nenough for one day.\u201d\n\n\fFive\nDISAPPEARANCE OF A SCIENTIST\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think that even when a jury had acquitted Robert Grant alias Biggs of\nthe murder of Jonathan Whalley Inspector Meadows was entirely convinced of his\ninnocence.",
    "The case which he had built up against Grant\u2014the man\u2019s record the jade which\nhe had stolen the boots which fitted the footprints so exactly\u2014was to his matteroffact\nmind too complete to be easily upset but Poirot compelled much against his inclination to\ngive evidence convinced the jury.",
    "Two witnesses were produced who had seen a butcher\u2019s\ncart drive up to the bungalow on that Monday morning and the local butcher testifed that his\ncart only called there on Wednesdays and Fridays.",
    "A woman was actually found who when questioned remembered seeing the butcher\u2019s\nman leaving the bungalow but she could furnish no useful description of him.",
    "The only\nimpression he seemed to have left on her mind was that he was clean shaven of medium\nheight and looked exactly like a butcher\u2019s man.",
    "At this description Poirot shrugged his\nshoulders philosophically.",
    "\u201cIt is as I tell you Hastings\u201d he said to me after the trial.",
    "\u201cHe is an artist this one.",
    "He\ndisguises himself not with the false beard and the blue spectacles.",
    "He alters his features\nyes but that is the least part.",
    "For the time being he is the man he would be.",
    "He lives in his\npart.\u201d\nCertainly I was compelled to admit that the man who had visited us from Hanwell had\nfitted in exactly with my idea of what an asylum attendant should look like.",
    "I should never\nfor a moment have dreamt of doubting that he was genuine.",
    "It was all a little discouraging and our experience on Dartmoor did not seem to have\nhelped us at all.",
    "I said as much to Poirot but he would not admit that we had gained nothing.",
    "\u201cWe progress\u201d he said \u201cwe progress.",
    "At every contact with this man we learn a little\nof his mind and his methods.",
    "Of us and our plans he knows nothing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there Poirot\u201d I protested \u201che and I seem to be in the same boat.",
    "You don\u2019t seem\nto me to have any plans you seem to sit and wait for him to do something.\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cMon ami you do not change.",
    "Always the same Hastings who would be up and at their\nthroats.",
    "Perhaps\u201d he added as a knock sounded on the door \u201cyou have here your chance it\nmay be our friend who enters.\u201d And he laughed at my disappointment when Inspector Japp\nand another man entered the room.",

    "\u201cYou may remember reading M. Poirot that a number of torpedo boats and destroyers\nwere sunk by being dashed upon the rocks off the American coast.",
    "It was just after the\nJapanese earthquake and the explanation given was that the disaster was the result of a tidal\nwave.",
    "Now a short time ago a roundup was made of certain crooks and gunmen and with\nthem were captured some papers which put an entirely new face upon the matter.",

    "\u201cYou reflect not\u2014you use\nnot the little grey cells of the brain.",
    "Who are these men who send a portion of your navy to\ndestruction simply as a trial of their power For that was all it was Monsieur a test of this\nnew force of magnetical attraction which they hold.\u201d\n\u201cGo on with you moosior\u201d said Japp goodhumouredly.",
    "I\u2019ve read of supercriminals\nmany a time but I\u2019ve never come across them.",
    "Well you\u2019ve heard Captain Kent\u2019s story.",
    "Anything further I can do for you\u201d\n\u201cYes my good friend.",
    "You can give me the address of Mrs. Halliday\u2014and also a few\nwords of introduction to her if you will be so kind.\u201d\n\n\fThus it was that the following day saw us bound for Chetwynd Lodge near the village\nof Chobham in Surrey.",
    "Mrs. Halliday received us at once a tall fair woman nervous and eager in manner.",
    "With her was her little girl a beautiful child of five.",
    "Poirot explained the purpose of our visit.",
    "\u201cOh M. Poirot I am so glad so thankful.",
    "I have heard of you of course.",
    "You will not\nbe like these Scotland Yard people who will not listen or try to understand.",
    "And the French\npolice are just as bad\u2014worse I think.",
    "They are all convinced that my husband has gone off\nwith some other woman.",
    "But he wasn\u2019t like that All he thought of in life was his work.",
    "Half\nour quarrels came from that.",
    "He cared for it more than he did for me.\u201d\n\u201cEnglishmen they are like that\u201d said Poirot soothingly.",
    "\u201cAnd if it is not work it is the\ngames the sport.",
    "All those things they take au grand s\u00e9rieux.",
    "Now madame recount to me\nexactly in detail and as methodically as you can the exact circumstances of your husband\u2019s\ndisappearance.\u201d\n\u201cMy husband went to Paris on Thursday the 20th of July.",
    "He was to meet and visit\nvarious people there connected with his work amongst them Madame Olivier.\u201d\nPoirot nodded at the mention of the famous French woman chemist who had eclipsed\neven Madame Curie in the brilliance of her achievements.",
    "She had been decorated by the\nFrench Government and was one of the most prominent personalities of the day.",
    "\u201cHe arrived there in the evening and went at once to the Hotel Castiglione in the rue de\nCastiglione.",
    "On the following morning he had an appointment with Professor Bourgoneau\nwhich he kept.",
    "His manner was normal and pleasant.",
    "The two men had a most interesting\nconversation and it was arranged that he should witness some experiments in the\nprofessor\u2019s laboratory on the following day.",
    "He lunched alone at the Caf\u00e9 Royal went for a\nwalk in the Bois and then visited Madame Olivier at her house at Passy.",
    "There also his\nmanner was perfectly normal.",
    "He left about six.",
    "Where he dined is not known probably\nalone at some restaurant.",
    "He returned to the hotel about eleven o\u2019clock and went straight up\nto his room after inquiring if any letters had come for him.",
    "On the following morning he\nwalked out of the hotel and has not been seen again.\u201d\n\u201cAt what time did he leave the hotel At the hour when he would normally leave it to\nkeep his appointment at Professor Bourgoneau\u2019s laboratory\u201d\n\u201cWe do not know.",
    "He was not remarked leaving the hotel.",
    "But no petit d\u00e9jeuner was\nserved to him which seems to indicate that he went out early.\u201d\n\u201cOr he might in fact have gone out again after he came in the night before\u201d\n\u201cI do not think so.",
    "His bed had been slept in and the night porter would have\nremembered anyone going out at that hour.\u201d\n\u201cA very just observation madame.",
    "We may take it then that he left early on the\nfollowing morning\u2014and that is reassuring from one point of view.",
    "He is not likely to have\nfallen a victim to any Apache assault at that hour.",
    "His baggage now was it all left behind\u201d\nMrs. Halliday seemed rather reluctant to answer but at last she said\n\n\f\u201cNo\u2014he must have taken one small suitcase with him.\u201d\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully \u201cI wonder where he was that evening.",
    "If we knew that\nwe should know a great deal.",
    "Whom did he meet\u2014there lies the mystery.",
    "Madame myself\nI do not of necessity accept the view of the police with them is it always \u2018Cherchez la\nfemme.\u2019 Yet it is clear that something occurred that night to alter your husband\u2019s plans.",
    "You\nsay he asked for letters on returning to the hotel.",
    "Did he receive any\u201d\n\u201cOne only and that must have been the one I wrote him on the day he left England.\u201d\nPoirot remained sunk in thought for a full minute then he rose briskly to his feet.",
    "\u201cWell madame the solution of the mystery lies in Paris and to find it I myself journey\nto Paris on the instant.\u201d\n\u201cIt is all a long time ago monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes.",
    "Nevertheless it is there that we must seek.\u201d\nHe turned to leave the room but paused with his hand on the door.",
    "\u201cTell me madame do you ever remember your husband mentioning the phrase \u2018The\nBig Four\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe Big Four\u201d she repeated thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cNo I can\u2019t say Ido.\u201d\n\n\fSix\nTHE WOMAN ON THE STAIRS\n\nThat was all that could be elicited from Mrs. Halliday.",
    "We hurried back to London and the\nfollowing day saw us en route for the Continent.",
    "With rather a rueful smile Poirot\nobserved\n\u201cThis Big Four they make me to bestir myself mon ami.",
    "I run up and down all over\nthe ground like our old friend \u2018the human foxhound.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll meet him in Paris\u201d I said knowing that he referred to a certain Giraud\none of the most trusted detectives of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 whom he had met on a previous occasion.",
    "Poirot made a grimace.",
    "\u201cI devoutly hope not.",
    "He loved me not that one.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t it be a very difficult task\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cTo find out what an unknown Englishman\ndid on an evening two months ago\u201d\n\u201cVery difficult mon ami.",
    "But as you know well difficulties rejoice the heart of\nHercule Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cYou think the Big Four kidnapped him\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Our inquiries necessarily went over old ground and we learnt little to add to what Mrs.\nHalliday had already told us.",
    "Poirot had a lengthy interview with Professor Bourgoneau\nduring which he sought to elicit whether Halliday had mentioned any plan of his own for the\nevening but we drew a complete blank.",
    "Our next source of information was the famous Madame Olivier.",
    "I was quite excited as\nwe mounted the steps of her villa at Passy.",
    "It has always seemed to me extraordinary that a\nwoman should go so far in the scientific world.",
    "I should have thought a purely masculine\nbrain was needed for such work.",
    "The door was opened by a young lad of seventeen or thereabouts who reminded me\nvaguely of an acolyte so ritualistic was his manner.",
    "Poirot had taken the trouble to arrange\nour interview beforehand as he knew Madame Olivier never received anyone without an\nappointment being immersed in research work most of the day.",
    "We were shown into a small salon and presently the mistress of the house came to us\nthere.",
    "Madame Olivier was a very tall woman her tallness accentuated by the long white\noverall she wore and a coif like a nun\u2019s that shrouded her head.",
    "She had a long pale face\nand wonderful dark eyes that burnt with a light almost fanatical.",
    "She looked more like a\npriestess of old than a modern Frenchwoman.",
    "One cheek was disfigured by a scar and I\nremembered that her husband and coworker had been killed in an explosion in the\nlaboratory three years before and that she herself had been terribly burned.",
    "Ever since then\nshe had shut herself away from the world and plunged with fiery energy into the work of\n\n\fscientific research.",
    "She received us with cold politeness.",
    "\u201cI have been interviewed by the police many times messieurs.",
    "I think it hardly likely\nthat I can help you since I have not been able to help them.\u201d\n\u201cMadame it is possible that I shall not ask you quite the same questions.",
    "To begin with\nof what did you talk together you and M. Halliday\u201d\nShe looked a trifle surprised.",
    "\u201cBut of his work His work\u2014and also mine.\u201d\n\u201cDid he mention to you the theories he had embodied recently in his paper read before\nthe British Association\u201d\n\u201cCertainly he did.",
    "It was chiefly of those we spoke.\u201d\n\u201cHis ideas were somewhat fantastic were they not\u201d asked Poirot carelessly.",
    "\u201cSome people have thought so.",
    "I do not agree.\u201d\n\u201cYou consider them practicable\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly practicable.",
    "My own line of research has been somewhat similar though not\nundertaken with the same end in view.",
    "I have been investigating the gamma rays emitted by\nthe substance usually known as Radium C a product of Radium emanation and in doing so I\nhave come across some very interesting magnetical phenomena.",
    "Indeed I have a theory as to\nthe actual nature of the force we call magnetism but it is not yet time for my discoveries to\nbe given to the world.",
    "Mr. Halliday\u2019s experiments and views were exceedingly interesting\nto me.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Then he asked a question which surprised me.",
    "\u201cMadame where did you converse on these topics In here\u201d\n\u201cNo monsieur.",
    "In the laboratory.\u201d\n\u201cMay I see it\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\nShe led the way to the door from which she had entered.",
    "It opened on a small passage.",
    "We passed through two doors and found ourselves in the big laboratory with its array of\nbeakers and crucibles and a hundred appliances of which I did not even know the names.",
    "There were two occupants both busy with some experiment.",
    "Madame Olivier introduced\nthem.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle Claude one of my assistants.\u201d A tall seriousfaced young girl bowed\nto us.",
    "\u201cMonsieur Henri an old and trusted friend.\u201d\nThe young man short and dark bowed jerkily.",
    "Poirot looked round him.",
    "There were two other doors besides the one by which we had\nentered.",
    "One madame explained led into the garden the other into a smaller chamber also\ndevoted to research.",
    "Poirot took all this in then declared himself ready to return to the\nsalon.",
    "\u201cMadame were you alone with M. Halliday during your interview\u201d\n\u201cYes monsieur.",
    "My two assistants were in the smaller room next door.\u201d\n\u201cCould your conversation be overheard\u2014by them or anyone else\u201d\nMadame reflected then shook her head.",
    "\u201cI do not think so.",
    "I am almost sure it could not.",
    "The doors were all shut.\u201d\n\u201cCould anyone have been concealed in the room\u201d\n\u201cThere is the big cupboard in the corner\u2014but the idea is absurd.\u201d\n\u201cPas tout \u00e0 fait madame.",
    "One thing more did M. Halliday make any mention of his\nplans for the evening\u201d\n\u201cHe said nothing whatever monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cI thank you madame and I apologize for disturbing you.",
    "Pray do not trouble\u2014we can\nfind our way out.\u201d\nWe stepped out into the hall.",
    "A lady was just entering the front door as we did so.",
    "She\nran quickly up the stairs and I was left with an impression of the heavy mourning that\ndenotes a French widow.",
    "\u201cA most unusual type of woman that\u201d remarked Poirot as we walked away.",
    "\u201cMadame Olivier Yes she\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMais non not Madame Olivier.",
    "Cela va sans dire There are not many geniuses of her\nstamp in the world.",
    "No I referred to the other lady\u2014the lady on the stairs.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see her face\u201d I said staring.",
    "\u201cAnd I hardly see how you could have done.",
    "She\nnever looked at us.\u201d\n\u201cThat is why I said she was an unusual type\u201d said Poirot placidly.",
    "\u201cA woman who\nenters her home\u2014for I presume that it is her home since she enters with a key\u2014and runs\nstraight upstairs without even looking at two strange visitors in the hall to see who they are\nis a very unusual type of woman\u2014quite unnatural in fact.",
    "Mille tonnerres what is that\u201d\nHe dragged me back\u2014just in time.",
    "A tree had crashed down on to the sidewalk just\nmissing us.",
    "Poirot stared at it pale and upset.",
    "\u201cIt was a near thing that But clumsy all the same\u2014for I had no suspicion\u2014at least\nhardly any suspicion.",
    "Yes but for my quick eyes the eyes of a cat Hercule Poirot might\nnow be crushed out of existence\u2014a terrible calamity for the world.",
    "And you too mon\nami\u2014though that would not be such a national catastrophe.\u201d\n\u201cThank you\u201d I said coldly.",
    "\u201cAnd what are we going to do now\u201d\n\u201cDo\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cWe are going to think.",
    "Yes here and now we are going to\nexercise our little grey cells.",
    "This M. Halliday now was he really in Paris Yes for\nProfessor Bourgoneau who knows him saw and spoke to him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat on earth are you driving at\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cThat was Friday morning.",
    "He was last seen at eleven Friday night\u2014but was he seen\nthen\u201d\n\u201cThe porter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA night porter\u2014who had not previously seen Halliday.",
    "A man comes in sufficiently\nlike Halliday\u2014we may trust Number Four for that\u2014asks for letters goes upstairs packs a\nsmall suitcase and slips out the next morning.",
    "Nobody saw Halliday all that evening\u2014no\nbecause he was already in the hands of his enemies.",
    "Was it Halliday whom Madame Olivier\nreceived Yes for though she did not know him by sight an imposter could hardly deceive\nher on her own special subject.",
    "He came here he had his interview he left.",
    "What happened\nnext\u201d\nSeizing me by the arm Poirot was fairly dragging me back to the villa.",
    "\u201cNow mon ami imagine that it is the day after the disappearance and that we are\ntracking footprints.",
    "You love footprints do you not See\u2014here they go a man\u2019s M.\nHalliday\u2019s \u2026 He turns to the right as we did he walks briskly\u2014ah other footsteps\nfollowing behind\u2014very quickly\u2014small footsteps a woman\u2019s.",
    "See she catches him up\u2014a\nslim young woman in a widow\u2019s veil.",
    "\u2018Pardon monsieur Madame Olivier desires that I\nrecall you.\u2019 He stops he turns.",
    "Now where would the young woman take him Is it\ncoincidence that she catches up with him just where a narrow alleyway opens dividing two\ngardens She leads him down it.",
    "\u2018It is shorter this way monsieur.\u2019 On the right is the garden\nof Madame Olivier\u2019s villa on the left the garden of another villa\u2014and from that garden\nmark you the tree fell\u2014so nearly on us.",
    "Garden doors from both open on the alley.",
    "The\nambush is there.",
    "Men pour out overpower him and carry him into the strange villa.\u201d\n\u201cGood gracious Poirot\u201d I cried \u201care you pretending to see all this\u201d\n\u201cI see it with the eyes of the mind mon ami.",
    "So and only so could it have happened.",
    "Come let us go back to the house.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to see Madame Olivier again\u201d\nPoirot gave a curious smile.",
    "\u201cNo Hastings I want to see the face of the lady on the stairs.\u201d\n\u201cWho do you think she is a relation of Madame Olivier\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cMore probably a secretary\u2014and a secretary engaged not very long ago.\u201d\nThe same gentle acolyte opened the door to us.",
    "\u201cCan you tell me\u201d said Poirot \u201cthe name of the lady the widow lady who came in just\nnow\u201d\n\u201cMadame Veroneau Madame\u2019s secretary\u201d\n\u201cThat is the lady.",
    "Would you be so kind as to ask her to speak to us for a moment.\u201d\nThe youth disappeared.",
    "He soon reappeared.",
    "\u201cI am sorry.",
    "Madame Veroneau must have gone out again.\u201d\n\u201cI think not\u201d said Poirot quietly.",
    "\u201cWill you give her my name M. Hercule Poirot and\n\n\fsay that it is important I should see her at once as I am just going to the Pr\u00e9fecture.\u201d\nAgain our messenger departed.",
    "This time the lady descended.",
    "She walked into the\nsalon.",
    "We followed her.",
    "She turned and raised her veil.",
    "To my astonishment I recognized\nour old antagonist the Countess Rossakoff a Russian countess who had engineered a\nparticularly smart jewel robbery in London.",
    "\u201cAs soon as I caught sight of you in the hall I feared the worst\u201d she observed\nplaintively.",
    "\u201cMy dear Countess Rossakoff\u2014\u201d\nShe shook her head.",
    "\u201cInez Veroneau now\u201d she murmured.",
    "\u201cA Spaniard married to a Frenchman.",
    "What do\nyou want of me M. Poirot You are a terrible man.",
    "You hunted me from London.",
    "Now I\nsuppose you will tell our wonderful Madame Olivier about me and hunt me from Paris\nWe poor Russians we must live you know.\u201d\n\u201cIt is more serious than that madame\u201d said Poirot watching her.",
    "\u201cI propose to enter\nthe villa next door and release M. Halliday if he is still alive.",
    "I know everything you see.\u201d\nI saw her sudden pallor.",
    "She bit her lip.",
    "Then she spoke with her usual decision.",
    "\u201cHe is still alive\u2014but he is not at the villa.",
    "Come monsieur I will make a bargain\nwith you.",
    "Freedom for me\u2014and M. Halliday alive and well for you.\u201d\n\u201cI accept\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI was about to propose the same bargain myself.",
    "By the way\nare the Big Four your employers madame\u201d\nAgain I saw that deathly pallor creep over her face but she left his question\nunanswered.",
    "Instead \u201cYou permit me to telephone\u201d she asked and crossing to the instrument she\nrang up a number.",
    "\u201cThe number of the villa\u201d she explained \u201cwhere our friend is now\nimprisoned.",
    "You may give it to the police\u2014the nest will be empty when they arrive.",
    "Ah I\nam through.",
    "Is that you Andr\u00e9 It is I Inez.",
    "The little Belgian knows all.",
    "Send Halliday to\nthe hotel and clear out.\u201d\nShe replaced the receiver and came towards us smiling.",
    "\u201cYou will accompany us to the hotel madame.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.",
    "I expected that.\u201d\nI got a taxi and we drove off together.",
    "I could see by Poirot\u2019s face that he was\nperplexed.",
    "The thing was almost too easy.",
    "We arrived at the hotel.",
    "The porter came up to us.",
    "\u201cA gentleman has arrived.",
    "He is in your rooms.",
    "He seems very ill. A nurse came with\nhim but she has left.\u201d\n\u201cThat is all right\u201d said Poirot \u201che is a friend of mine.\u201d\nWe went upstairs together.",
    "Sitting in a chair by the window was a haggard young\nfellow who looked in the last stages of exhaustion.",
    "Poirot went over to him.",
    "\u201cAre you John Halliday\u201d The man nodded.",
    "\u201cShow me your left arm.",
    "John Halliday has\na mole just below the left elbow.\u201d\nThe man stretched out his arm.",
    "The mole was there.",
    "Poirot bowed to the countess.",
    "She\nturned and left the room.",
    "A glass of brandy revived Halliday somewhat.",
    "\u201cMy God\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cI have been through hell\u2014hell \u2026 Those fiends are devils\nincarnate.",
    "My wife where is she What does she think They told me that she would\nbelieve\u2014would believe\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe does not\u201d said Poirot firmly.",
    "\u201cHer faith in you has never wavered.",
    "She is waiting\nfor you\u2014she and the child.\u201d\n\u201cThank God for that.",
    "I can hardly believe that I am free once more.\u201d\n\u201cNow that you are a little recovered monsieur I should like to hear the whole story\nfrom the beginning.\u201d\nHalliday looked at him with an indescribable expression.",
    "\u201cI remember\u2014nothing\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever heard of the Big Four\u201d\n\u201cSomething of them\u201d said Poirot dryly.",
    "\u201cYou do not know what I know.",
    "They have unlimited power.",
    "If I remain silent I shall\nbe safe\u2014if I say one word\u2014not only I but my nearest and dearest will suffer unspeakable\nthings.",
    "It is no good arguing with me.",
    "I know\u2026 I remember\u2014nothing.\u201d\nAnd getting up he walked from the room.",
    "Poirot\u2019s face wore a baffled expression.",
    "\u201cSo it is like that is it\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cThe Big Four win again.",
    "What is that you are\nholding in your hand Hastings\u201d\nI handed it to him.",
    "\u201cThe countess scribbled it before she left\u201d I explained.",
    "He read it.",
    "\u201cAu revoir.\u2014I.V.\u201d\n\u201cSigned with her initials\u2014I.V.",
    "Just a coincidence perhaps that they also stand for\nFour.",
    "I wonder Hastings I wonder.\u201d\n\n\fSeven\nTHE RADIUM THIEVES\n\nOn the night of his release Halliday slept in the room next to ours at the hotel and all night\nlong I heard him moaning and protesting in his sleep.",
    "Undoubtedly his experience in the\nvilla had broken his nerve and in the morning we failed completely to extract any\ninformation from him.",
    "He would only repeat his statement about the unlimited power at the\ndisposal of the Big Four and his assurance of the vengeance which would follow if he\ntalked.",
    "After lunch he departed to rejoin his wife in England but Poirot and I remained behind\nin Paris.",
    "I was all for energetic proceedings of some kind or other and Poirot\u2019s quiescence\nannoyed me.",
    "\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake Poirot\u201d I urged \u201clet us be up and at them.\u201d\n\u201cAdmirable mon ami admirable Up where and at whom Be precise I beg of you.\u201d\n\u201cAt the Big Four of course.\u201d\n\u201cCela va sans dire.",
    "But how would you set about it\u201d\n\u201cThe police\u201d I hazarded doubtfully.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "\u201cThey would accuse us of romancing.",
    "We have nothing to go upon\u2014nothing whatever.",
    "We must wait.\u201d\n\u201cWait for what\u201d\n\u201cWait for them to make a move.",
    "See now in England you all comprehend and adore la\nboxe.",
    "If one man does not make a move the other must and by permitting the adversary to\nmake the attack one learns something about him.",
    "That is our part\u2014to let the other side make\nthe attack.\u201d\n\u201cYou think they will\u201d I said doubtfully.",
    "\u201cI have no doubt whatever of it.",
    "To begin with see they try to get me out of England.",
    "That fails.",
    "Then in the Dartmoor affair we step in and save their victim from the gallows.",
    "And yesterday once again we interfere with their plans.",
    "Assuredly they will not leave the\nmatter there.\u201d\nAs I reflected on this there was a knock on the door.",
    "Without waiting for a reply a man\nstepped into the room and closed the door behind him.",
    "He was a tall thin man with a\nslightly hooked nose and a sallow complexion.",
    "He wore an overcoat buttoned up to his chin\nand a soft hat well pulled down over his eyes.",
    "\u201cExcuse me gentlemen for my somewhat unceremonious entry\u201d he said in a soft voice\n\n\f\u201cbut my business is of a rather unorthodox nature.\u201d\nSmiling he advanced to the table and sat down by it.",
    "I was about to spring up but\nPoirot restrained me with a gesture.",
    "\u201cAs you say monsieur your entry is somewhat unceremonious.",
    "Will you kindly state\nyour business\u201d\n\u201cMy dear M. Poirot it is very simple.",
    "You have been annoying my friends.\u201d\n\u201cIn what way\u201d\n\u201cCome come M. Poirot.",
    "You do not seriously ask me that You know as well as I do.\u201d\n\u201cIt depends monsieur upon who these friends of yours are.\u201d\nWithout a word the man drew from his pocket a cigarette case and opening it took\nout four cigarettes and tossed them on the table.",
    "Then he picked them up and returned them\nto his case which he replaced in his pocket.",
    "\u201cAha\u201d said Poirot \u201cso it is like that is it And what do your friends suggest\u201d\n\u201cThey suggest monsieur that you should employ your talents\u2014your very considerable\ntalents\u2014in the detection of legitimate crime\u2014return to your former avocations and solve\nthe problems of London society ladies.\u201d\n\u201cA peaceful programme\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd supposing I do not agree\u201d\nThe man made an eloquent gesture.",
    "\u201cWe should regret it of course exceedingly\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSo would all the friends and\nadmirers of the great M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "But regrets however poignant do not bring a man\nto life again.\u201d\n\u201cPut very delicately\u201d said Poirot nodding his head.",
    "\u201cAnd supposing I\u2014accept\u201d\n\u201cIn that case I am empowered to offer you\u2014compensation.\u201d\nHe drew out a pocketbook and threw ten notes on the table.",
    "They were for ten thousand\nfrancs each.",
    "\u201cThat is merely a guarantee of our good faith\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cTen times that amount will be\npaid you.\u201d\n\u201cGood God\u201d I cried springing up \u201cyou dare to think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSit down Hastings\u201d said Poirot autocratically.",
    "\u201cSubdue your so beautiful and honest\nnature and sit down.",
    "To you monsieur I will say this.",
    "What is to prevent me ringing up the\npolice and giving you into their custody whilst my friend here prevents you from\nescaping\u201d\n\u201cBy all means do so if you think it advisable\u201d said our visitor calmly.",
    "\u201cOh look here Poirot\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t stand this.",
    "Ring up the police and have done\nwith it.\u201d\nRising swiftly I strode to the door and stood with my back against it.",
    "\u201cIt seems the obvious course\u201d murmured Poirot as though debating with himself.",
    "\u201cBut you distrust the obvious eh\u201d said our visitor smiling.",
    "\u201cGo on Poirot\u201d I urged.",
    "\u201cIt will be your responsibility mon ami.\u201d\nAs he lifted the receiver the man made a sudden catlike jump at me.",
    "I was ready for\nhim.",
    "In another minute we were locked together staggering round the room.",
    "Suddenly I felt\nhim slip and falter.",
    "I pressed my advantage.",
    "He went down before me.",
    "And then in the very\nflush of victory an extraordinary thing happened.",
    "I felt myself flying forwards.",
    "Head first I\ncrashed into the wall in a complicated heap.",
    "I was up in a minute but the door was already\nclosing behind my late adversary.",
    "I rushed to it and shook it it was locked on the outside.",
    "I\nseized the telephone from Poirot.",
    "\u201cIs that the bureau Stop a man who is coming out.",
    "A tall man with a buttonedup\novercoat and a soft hat.",
    "He is wanted by the police.\u201d\nVery few minutes elapsed before we heard a noise in the corridor outside.",
    "The key was\nturned and the door flung open.",
    "The manager himself stood in the doorway.",
    "\u201cThe man\u2014you have got him\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cNo monsieur.",
    "No one has descended.\u201d\n\u201cYou must have passed him.\u201d\n\u201cWe have passed no one monsieur.",
    "It is incredible that he can have escaped.\u201d\n\u201cYou have passed someone I think\u201d said Poirot in his gentle voice.",
    "\u201cOne of the hotel\nstaff perhaps\u201d\n\u201cOnly a waiter carrying a tray monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot in a tone that spoke infinities.",
    "\u201cSo that was why he wore his overcoat buttoned up to his chin\u201d mused Poirot when\nwe had finally got rid of the excited hotel officials.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m awfully sorry Poirot\u201d I murmured rather crestfallen.",
    "\u201cI thought I\u2019d downed him\nall right.\u201d\n\u201cYes that was a Japanese trick I fancy.",
    "Do not distress yourself mon ami.",
    "All went\naccording to plan\u2014his plan.",
    "That is what I wanted.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this\u201d I cried pouncing on a brown object that lay on the floor.",
    "It was a slim pocketbook of brown leather and had evidently fallen from our visitor\u2019s\npocket during his struggle with me.",
    "It contained two receipted bills in the name of M. Felix\nLaon and a foldedup piece of paper which made my heart beat faster.",
    "It was a half sheet of\nnotepaper on which a few words were scrawled in pencil but they were words of supreme\nimportance.",
    "\u201cThe next meeting of the council will be on Friday at 34 rue des Echelles at 11 a.m.\u201d\nIt was signed with a big figure 4.",
    "And today was Friday and the clock on the mantelpiece showed the hour to be 1030.",
    "\u201cMy God what a chance\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cFate is playing into our hands.",
    "We must start at\nonce though.",
    "What stupendous luck.\u201d\n\u201cSo that was why he came\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cI see it all now.\u201d\n\u201cSee what Come on Poirot don\u2019t stay daydreaming there.\u201d\nPoirot looked at me and slowly shook his head smiling as he did so.",
    "\u201c\u2018Will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly\u2019 That is your little English\nnursery rhyme is it not No no\u2014they are subtle\u2014but not so subtle as Hercule Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat on earth are you driving at Poirot\u201d\n\u201cMy friend I have been asking myself the reason of this morning\u2019s visit.",
    "Did our visitor\nreally hope to succeed in bribing me Or alternatively in frightening me into abandoning\nmy task It seemed hardly credible.",
    "Why then did he come And now I see the whole plan\n\u2014very neat\u2014very pretty\u2014the ostensible reason to bribe or frighten me\u2014the necessary\nstruggle which he took no pains to avoid and which should make the dropped pocketbook\nnatural and reasonable\u2014and finally\u2014the pitfall Rue des Echelles 11 a.m.",
    "I think not\nmon ami One does not catch Hercule Poirot as easily as that.\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens\u201d I gasped.",
    "Poirot was frowning to himself.",
    "\u201cThere is still one thing I do not understand.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d\n\u201cThe time Hastings\u2014the time.",
    "If they wanted to decoy me away surely nighttime\nwould be better Why this early hour Is it possible that something is about to happen this\nmorning Something which they are anxious Hercule Poirot should not know about\u201d\nHe shook his head.",
    "\u201cWe shall see.",
    "Here I sit mon ami.",
    "We do not stir out this morning.",
    "We await events\nhere.\u201d\nIt was at half past eleven exactly that the summons came.",
    "A petit bleu.",
    "Poirot tore it\nopen then handed it to me.",
    "It was from Madame Olivier the worldfamous scientist whom\nwe had visited yesterday in connection with the Halliday case.",
    "It asked us to come out to\nPassy at once.",
    "We obeyed the summons without an instant\u2019s delay.",
    "Madame Olivier received us in the\nsame small salon.",
    "I was struck anew with the wonderful power of this woman with her long\nnun\u2019s face and burning eyes\u2014this brilliant successor of Becquerel and the Curies.",
    "She came\nto the point at once.",
    "\u201cMessieurs you interviewed me yesterday about the disappearance of M. Halliday.",
    "I\nnow learn that you returned to the house a second time and asked to see my secretary Inez\nVeroneau.",
    "She left the house with you and has not returned here since.\u201d\n\u201cIs that all madame\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNo monsieur it is not.",
    "Last night the laboratory was broken into and several valuable\npapers and memoranda were stolen.",
    "The thieves had a try for something more precious still\nbut luckily they failed to open the big safe.\u201d\n\u201cMadame these are the facts of the case.",
    "Your late secretary Madame Veroneau was\nreally the Countess Rossakoff an expert thief and it was she who was responsible for the\ndisappearance of M. Halliday.",
    "How long had she been with you\u201d\n\u201cFive months Monsieur.",
    "What you say amazes me.\u201d\n\u201cIt is true nevertheless.",
    "These papers were they easy to find Or do you think an\ninside knowledge was shown\u201d\n\u201cIt is rather curious that the thieves knew exactly where to look.",
    "You think Inez\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes I have no doubt that it was upon her information that they acted.",
    "But what is this\nprecious thing that the thieves failed to find Jewels\u201d\nMadame Olivier shook her head with a faint smile.",
    "\u201cSomething much more precious than that monsieur.\u201d She looked round her then bent\nforward lowering her voice.",
    "\u201cRadium monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cRadium\u201d\n\u201cYes monsieur.",
    "I am now at the crux of my experiments.",
    "I possess a small portion of\nradium myself\u2014more has been lent to me for the process I am at work upon.",
    "Small though\nthe actual quantity is it comprises a large amount of the world\u2019s stock and represents a\nvalue of millions of francs.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where is it\u201d\n\u201cIn its leaden case in the big safe\u2014the safe purposely appears to be of an old and\nwornout pattern but it is really a triumph of the safemaker\u2019s art.",
    "That is probably why the\nthieves were unable to open it.\u201d\n\u201cHow long are you keeping this radium in your possession\u201d\n\u201cOnly for two days more monsieur.",
    "Then my experiments will be concluded.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s eyes brightened.",
    "\u201cAnd Inez Veroneau is aware of the fact Good\u2014then our friends will come back.",
    "Not\na word of me to anyone madame.",
    "But rest assured I will save your radium for you.",
    "You\nhave a key of the door leading from the laboratory to the garden\u201d\n\u201cYes monsieur.",
    "Here it is.",
    "I have a duplicate for myself.",
    "And here is the key of the\ngarden door leading out into the alleyway between this villa and the next one.\u201d\n\u201cI thank you madame.",
    "Tonight go to bed as usual have no fears and leave all to me.",
    "But not a word to anyone\u2014not to your two assistants\u2014Mademoiselle Claude and Monsieur\nHenri is it not\u2014particularly not a word to them.\u201d\nPoirot left the villa rubbing his hands in great satisfaction.",
    "\u201cWhat are we going to do now\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cNow Hastings we are about to leave Paris\u2014for England.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cWe will pack our effects have lunch and drive to the Gare du Nord.\u201d\n\u201cBut the radium\u201d\n\u201cI said we were going to leave for England\u2014I did not say we were going to arrive\nthere.",
    "Reflect a moment Hastings.",
    "It is quite certain that we are being watched and\nfollowed.",
    "Our enemies must believe that we are going back to England and they certainly\nwill not believe that unless they see us get on board the train and start.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean we are to slip off again at the last minute\u201d\n\u201cNo Hastings.",
    "Our enemies will be satisfied with nothing less than a bona fide\ndeparture.\u201d\n\u201cBut the train doesn\u2019t stop until Calais\u201d\n\u201cIt will stop if it is paid to do so.\u201d\n\u201cOh come now Poirot\u2014surely you can\u2019t pay an express to stop\u2014they\u2019d refuse.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear friend have you never remarked the little handle\u2014the signal d\u2019arr\u00eat\u2014\npenalty for improper use 100 francs I think\u201d\n\u201cOh you are going to pull that\u201d\n\u201cOr rather a friend of mine Pierre Combeau will do so.",
    "Then while he is arguing with\nthe guard and making a big scene and all the train is agog with interest you and I will fade\nquietly away.\u201d\nWe duly carried out Poirot\u2019s plan.",
    "Pierre Combeau an old crony of Poirot\u2019s and who\nevidently knew my little friend\u2019s methods pretty well fell in with the arrangements.",
    "The\ncommunication cord was pulled just as we got to the outskirts of Paris.",
    "Combeau \u201cmade a\nscene\u201d in the most approved French fashion and Poirot and I were able to leave the train\nwithout anyone being interested in our departure.",
    "Our first proceeding was to make a\nconsiderable change in our appearance.",
    "Poirot had brought the materials for this with him in\na small case.",
    "Two loafers in dirty blue blouses were the result.",
    "We had dinner in an obscure\nhostelry and started back to Paris afterwards.",
    "It was close on eleven o\u2019clock when we found ourselves once more in the\nneighbourhood of Madame Olivier\u2019s villa.",
    "We looked up and down the road before slipping\ninto the alleyway.",
    "The whole place appeared to be perfectly deserted.",
    "One thing we could\nbe quite certain of no one was following us.",
    "\u201cI do not expect them to be here yet\u201d whispered Poirot to me.",
    "\u201cPossibly they may not\ncome until tomorrow night but they know perfectly well that there are only two nights on\nwhich the radium will be there.\u201d\nVery cautiously we turned the key in the garden door.",
    "It opened noiselessly and we\nstepped into the garden.",
    "And then with complete unexpectedness the blow fell.",
    "In a minute we were\n\n\fsurrounded gagged and bound.",
    "At least ten men must have been waiting for us.",
    "Resistance\nwas useless.",
    "Like two helpless bundles we were lifted up and carried along.",
    "To my intense\nastonishment they took us towards the house and not away from it.",
    "With a key they opened\nthe door into the laboratory and carried us into it.",
    "One of the men stooped down before a big\nsafe.",
    "The door of it swung open.",
    "I felt an unpleasant sensation down my spine.",
    "Were they\ngoing to bundle us into it and leave us there to asphyxiate slowly\nHowever to my amazement I saw that from the inside of the safe steps led down\nbeneath the floor.",
    "We were thrust down this narrow way and eventually came out into a big\nsubterranean chamber.",
    "A woman stood there tall and imposing with a black velvet mask\ncovering her face.",
    "She was clearly in command of the situation by her gestures of authority.",
    "The men slung us down on the floor and left us\u2014alone with the mysterious creature in the\nmask.",
    "I had no doubt who she was.",
    "This was the unknown Frenchwoman\u2014Number Three of\nthe Big Four.",
    "She knelt down beside us and removed the gags but left us bound then rising and\nfacing us with a sudden swift gesture she removed her mask.",
    "It was Madame Olivier\n\u201cM.",
    "Poirot\u201d she said in a low mocking tone.",
    "\u201cThe great the wonderful the unique M.\nPoirot.",
    "I sent a warning to you yesterday morning.",
    "You chose to disregard it\u2014you thought\nyou could pit your wits against US.",
    "And now you are here\u201d\nThere was a cold malignity about her that froze me to the marrow.",
    "It was so at variance\nwith the burning fire of her eyes.",
    "She was mad\u2014mad\u2014with the madness of genius\nPoirot said nothing.",
    "His jaw had dropped and he was staring at her.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d she said softly \u201cthis is the end.",
    "We cannot permit our plans to be interfered\nwith.",
    "Have you any last request to make\u201d\nNever before or since have I felt so near death.",
    "Poirot was magnificent.",
    "He neither\nflinched nor paled just stared at her with unabated interest.",
    "\u201cYour psychology interests me enormously madame\u201d he said quietly.",
    "\u201cIt is a pity that I\nhave so short a time to devote to studying it.",
    "Yes I have a request to make.",
    "A condemned\nman is always allowed a last smoke I believe.",

    "I shall not untie your hands\u2014but I will find you\na cigarette.\u201d\nShe knelt down by him extracted his cigarette case took out a cigarette and placed it\nbetween his lips.",
    "\u201cAnd now a match\u201d she said rising.",
    "\u201cIt is not necessary madame.\u201d Something in his voice startled me.",

    "I have only to blow \u2026 Ah you\nstart.",
    "Do not move madame.",
    "The mechanism of this cigarette is most ingenious.",
    "One blows\n\u2014and a tiny dart resembling a fishbone flies through the air\u2014to find its mark.",
    "You do not\nwish to die madame.",
    "Therefore I beg of you to release my friend Hastings from his bonds.",
    "I\ncannot use my hands but I can turn my head\u2014so\u2014you are still covered madame.",
    "Make no\nmistake I beg of you.\u201d\nSlowly with shaking hands and rage and hate convulsing her face she bent down and\ndid his bidding.",

    "It is a fortunate circumstance she sent away her henchmen.",
    "With a little luck we may hope to find the way out unobstructed.\u201d\nIn another minute Poirot stood by my side.",
    "He bowed to the lady.",
    "\u201cHercule Poirot is not killed so easily madame.",
    "I wish you good night.\u201d\nThe gag prevented her from replying but the murderous gleam in her eyes frightened\nme.",
    "I hoped devoutly that we should never fall into her power again.",
    "Three minutes later we were outside the villa and hurriedly traversing the garden.",
    "The\nroad outside was deserted and we were soon clear of the neighbourhood.",

    "Yes I do.",
    "The tone in which you\nsaid multimillionaire was eloquent but let me impress upon you one fact\u2014this thing is being\nrun by men at the top\u2014and Mr. Ryland has the reputation of being no beauty in his business\ndealings.",
    "An able unscrupulous man a man who has all the wealth that he needs and is out\nfor unlimited power.\u201d\nThere was undoubtedly something to be said for Poirot\u2019s view.",

    "Let me but place Number Two definitely as Abe Ryland and we draw nearer to our goal.\u201d\n\u201cHe has just arrived in London I see by this\u201d I said tapping the letter.",
    "\u201cShall you call\nupon him and make your apologies in person\u201d\n\u201cI might do so.\u201d\nTwo days later Poirot returned to our rooms in a state of boundless excitement.",
    "He\ngrasped me by both hands in his most impulsive manner.",
    "\u201cMy friend an occasion stupendous unprecedented never to be repeated has\npresented itself But there is danger grave danger.",
    "I should not even ask you to attempt it.\u201d\n\n\fIf Poirot was trying to frighten me he was going the wrong way to work and so I told\nhim.",
    "Becoming less incoherent he unfolded his plan.",
    "It seemed that Ryland was looking for an English secretary one with a good social\nmanner and presence.",
    "It was Poirot\u2019s suggestion that I should apply for the post.",
    "\u201cI would do it myself mon ami\u201d he explained apologetically.",
    "\u201cBut see you it is\nalmost impossible for me to disguise myself in the needful manner.",
    "I speak the English very\nwell\u2014except when I am excited\u2014but hardly so as to deceive the ear and even though I\nwere to sacrifice my moustaches I doubt not but that I should still be recognizable as\nHercule Poirot.\u201d\nI doubted it also and declared myself ready and willing to take up the part and\npenetrate into Ryland\u2019s household.",
    "\u201cTen to one he won\u2019t engage me anyway\u201d I remarked.",
    "\u201cOh yes he will.",
    "I will arrange for you such testimonials as shall make him lick his\nlips.",
    "The Home Secretary himself shall recommend you.\u201d\nThis seemed to be carrying things a bit far but Poirot waved aside my remonstrances.",
    "\u201cOh yes he will do it.",
    "I investigated for him a little matter which might have caused a\ngrave scandal.",
    "All was solved with discretion and delicacy and now as you would say he\nperches upon my hand like the little bird and pecks the crumbs.\u201d\nOur first step was to engage the services of an artist in \u201cmakeup.\u201d He was a little man\nwith a quaint birdlike turn of the head not unlike Poirot\u2019s own.",
    "He considered me some\ntime in silence and then fell to work.",
    "When I looked at myself in the glass half an hour\nafterwards I was amazed.",
    "Special shoes caused me to stand at least two inches taller and\nthe coat I wore was arranged so as to give me a long lank weedy look.",
    "My eyebrows had\nbeen cunningly altered giving a totally different expression to my face I wore pads in my\ncheeks and the deep tan of my face was a thing of the past.",
    "My moustache had gone and a\ngold tooth was prominent on one side of my mouth.",
    "\u201cYour name\u201d said Poirot \u201cis Arthur Neville.",
    "God guard you my friend\u2014for I fear that\nyou go into perilous places.\u201d\nIt was with a beating heart that I presented myself at the Savoy at an hour named by\nMr. Ryland and asked to see the great man.",
    "After being kept waiting a minute or two I was shown upstairs to his suite.",
    "Ryland was sitting at a table.",
    "Spread out in front of him was a letter which I could see\nout of the tail of my eye was in the Home Secretary\u2019s handwriting.",
    "It was my first sight of\nthe American millionaire and in spite of myself I was impressed.",
    "He was tall and lean\nwith a jutting out chin and slightly hooked nose.",
    "His eyes glittered cold and grey behind\npenthouse brows.",
    "He had thick grizzled hair and a long black cigar without which I\nlearned later he was never seen protruded rakishly from the corner of his mouth.",
    "\u201cSiddown\u201d he grunted.",
    "I sat.",
    "He tapped the letter in front of him.",
    "\u201cAccording to this piece here you\u2019re the goods all right and I don\u2019t need to look\nfurther.",
    "Say are you well up in the social matters\u201d\nI said that I thought I could satisfy him in that respect.",
    "\u201cI mean to say if I have a lot of dooks and earls and viscounts and suchlike down to the\ncountry place I\u2019ve gotten you\u2019ll be able to sort them out all right and put them where they\nshould be round the dining table\u201d\n\u201cOh quite easily\u201d I replied smiling.",
    "We exchanged a few more preliminaries and then I found myself engaged.",
    "What Mr.\nRyland wanted was a secretary conversant with English society as he already had an\nAmerican secretary and a stenographer with him.",
    "Two days later I went down to Hatton Chase the seat of the Duke of Loamshire which\nthe American millionaire had rented for a period of six months.",
    "My duties gave me no difficulty whatever.",
    "At one period of my life I had been private\nsecretary to a busy member of Parliament so I was not called upon to assume a role\nunfamiliar to me.",
    "Mr. Ryland usually entertained a large party over the weekend but the\nmiddle of the week was comparatively quiet.",
    "I saw very little of Mr. Appleby the\nAmerican secretary but he seemed a pleasant normal young American very efficient in his\nwork.",
    "Of Miss Martin the stenographer I saw rather more.",
    "She was a pretty girl of about\ntwentythree or four with auburn hair and brown eyes that could look mischievous enough\nupon occasion though they were usually cast demurely down.",
    "I had an idea that she both\ndisliked and distrusted her employer though of course she was careful never to hint at\nanything of the kind but the time came when I was unexpectedly taken into her confidence.",
    "I had of course carefully scrutinized all the members of the household.",
    "One or two of\nthe servants had been newly engaged one of the footmen I think and some of the\nhousemaids.",
    "The butler the house keeper and the chef were the duke\u2019s own staff who had\nconsented to remain on in the establishment.",
    "The housemaids I dismissed as unimportant I\nscrutinized James the second footman very carefully but it was clear that he was an\nunderfootman and an underfootman only.",
    "He had indeed been engaged by the butler.",
    "A\nperson of whom I was far more suspicious was Deaves Ryland\u2019s valet whom he had\nbrought over from New York with him.",
    "An Englishman by birth with an irreproachable\nmanner I yet harboured vague suspicions about him.",
    "I had been at Hatton Chase three weeks and not an incident of any kind had arisen\nwhich I could lay my finger on in support of our theory.",
    "There was no trace of the activities\nof the Big Four.",
    "Mr. Ryland was a man of overpowering force and personality but I was\ncoming to believe that Poirot had made a mistake when he associated him with that dread\norganization.",
    "I even heard him mention Poirot in a casual way at dinner one night.",
    "\u201cWonderful little man they say.",
    "But he\u2019s a quitter.",
    "How do I know I put him on a deal\nand he turned me down the last minute.",
    "I\u2019m not taking any more of your Monsieur Hercule\nPoirot.\u201d\nIt was at moments such as these that I felt my cheek pads most wearisome\nAnd then Miss Martin told me a rather curious story.",
    "Ryland had gone to London for the\n\n\fday taking Appleby with him.",
    "Miss Martin and I were strolling together in the garden after\ntea.",
    "I liked the girl very much she was so unaffected and so natural.",
    "I could see that there\nwas something on her mind and at last out it came.",
    "\u201cDo you know Major Neville\u201d she said \u201cI am really thinking of resigning my post\nhere.\u201d\nI looked somewhat astonished and she went on hurriedly.",
    "\u201cOh I know it\u2019s a wonderful job to have got in a way.",
    "I suppose most people would\nthink me a fool to throw it up.",
    "But I can\u2019t stand abuse Major Neville.",
    "To be sworn at like a\ntrooper is more than I can bear.",
    "No gentleman would do such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cHas Ryland been swearing at you\u201d\nShe nodded.",
    "\u201cOf course he\u2019s always rather irritable and shorttempered.",
    "That one expects.",
    "It\u2019s all\nin the day\u2019s work.",
    "But to fly into such an absolute fury\u2014over nothing at all.",
    "He really\nlooked as though he could have murdered me And as I say over nothing at all\u201d\n\u201cTell me about it\u201d I said keenly interested.",
    "\u201cAs you know I open all Mr. Ryland\u2019s letters.",
    "Some I hand on to Mr. Appleby others I\ndeal with myself but I do all the preliminary sorting.",
    "Now there are certain letters that\ncome written on blue paper and with a tiny 4 marked on the corner\u2014I beg your pardon\ndid you speak\u201d\nI had been unable to repress a stifled exclamation but I hurriedly shook my head and\nbegged her to continue.",
    "\u201cWell as I was saying these letters come and there are strict orders that they are never\nto be opened but to be handed over to Mr. Ryland intact.",
    "And of course I always do so.",
    "But there was an unusually heavy mail yesterday morning and I was opening these letters in\na terrific hurry.",
    "By mistake I opened one of these letters.",
    "As soon as I saw what I had done\nI took it to Mr. Ryland and explained.",
    "To my utter amazement he flew into the most awful\nrage.",
    "As I tell you I was quite frightened.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was there in the letter I wonder to upset him so\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing\u2014that\u2019s just the curious part of it.",
    "I had read it before I discovered\nmy mistake.",
    "It was quite short.",
    "I can still remember it word for word and there was nothing\nin it that could possibly upset anyone.",
    "\u201cYou can repeat it you say\u201d I encouraged her.",
    "\u201cYes.\u201d She paused a minute and then repeated slowly whilst I noted down the words\nunobtrusively the following\nDear Sir\u2014The essential thing now I should say is to see the property.",
    "If you\ninsist on the quarry being included then seventeen thousand seems reasonable.",
    "11 per cent commission too much 4 percent is ample.",
    "Yours truly\nArthur Leversham\n\n\fMiss Martin went on\n\u201cEvidently about some property Mr. Ryland was thinking of buying.",
    "But really I do\nfeel that a man who can get into a rage over such a trifle is well dangerous.",
    "What do you\nthink I ought to do Major Neville You\u2019ve more experience of the world than I have.\u201d\nI soothed the girl down pointed out to her that Mr. Ryland had probably been suffering\nfrom the enemy of his race\u2014dyspepsia.",
    "In the end I sent her away quite comforted.",
    "But I\nwas not so easily satisfied myself.",
    "When the girl had gone and I was alone I took out my\nnotebook and ran over the letter which I had jotted down.",
    "What did it mean\u2014this\napparently innocentsounding missive Did it concern some business deal which Ryland\nwas undertaking and was he anxious that no details about it should leak out until it was\ncarried through That was a possible explanation.",
    "But I remembered the small figure 4 with\nwhich the envelopes were marked and I felt that at last I was on the track of the thing we\nwere seeking.",
    "I puzzled over the letter all that evening and most of the next day\u2014and then suddenly\nthe solution came to me.",
    "It was so simple too.",
    "The figure 4 was the clue.",
    "Read every fourth\nword in the letter and an entirely different message appeared.",
    "\u201cEssential should see you\nquarry seventeen eleven four.\u201d\nThe solution of the figures was easy.",
    "Seventeen stood for the seventeenth of October\u2014\nwhich was tomorrow eleven was the time and four was the signature\u2014either referring to\nthe mysterious Number Four himself\u2014or else it was the \u201ctrademark\u201d so to speak of the\nBig Four.",
    "The quarry was also intelligible.",
    "There was a big disused quarry on the estate\nabout half a mile from the house\u2014a lonely spot ideal for a secret meeting.",
    "For a moment or two I was tempted to run the show myself.",
    "It would be such a feather\nin my cap for once to have the pleasure of crowing over Poirot.",
    "But in the end I overcame the temptation.",
    "This was a big business\u2014I had no right to\nplay a lone hand and perhaps jeopardize our chances of success.",
    "For the first time we had\nstolen a march upon our enemies.",
    "We must make good this time\u2014and disguise the fact as I\nmight Poirot had the better brain of the two.",
    "I wrote off posthaste to him laying the facts before him and explaining how urgent it\nwas that we should overhear what went on at the interview.",
    "If he liked to leave it to me\nwell and good but I gave him detailed instructions how to reach the quarry from the station\nin case he should deem it wise to be present himself.",
    "I took the letter down to the village and posted it myself.",
    "I had been able to\ncommunicate with Poirot throughout my stay but we agreed that he should not attempt to\ncommunicate with me in case my letters should be tampered with.",
    "I was in a glow of excitement the following evening.",
    "No guests were staying in the\nhouse and I was busy with Mr. Ryland in his study all the evening.",
    "I had foreseen that this\nwould be the case which was why I had no hope of being able to meet Poirot at the station.",
    "I was however confident that I would be dismissed well before eleven o\u2019clock.",
    "Sure enough just after tenthirty Mr. Ryland glanced at the clock and announced that\nhe was \u201cthrough.\u201d I took the hint and retired discreetly.",
    "I went upstairs as though going to\n\n\fbed but slipped quietly down a side staircase and let myself out into the garden having\ntaken the precaution to don a dark overcoat to hide my white shirtfront.",
    "I had gone some way down the garden when I chanced to look over my shoulder.",
    "Mr.\nRyland was just stepping out from his study window into the garden.",
    "He was starting to\nkeep the appointment.",
    "I redoubled my pace so as to get a clear start.",
    "I arrived at the quarry\nsomewhat out of breath.",
    "There seemed no one about and I crawled into a thick tangle of\nbushes and awaited developments.",
    "Ten minutes later just on the stroke of eleven Ryland stalked up his hat over his eyes\nand the inevitable cigar in his mouth.",
    "He gave a quick look round and then plunged into the\nhollows of the quarry below.",
    "Presently I heard a low murmur of voices come up to me.",
    "Evidently the other man\u2014or men\u2014whoever they were had arrived first at the rendezvous.",
    "I\ncrawled cautiously out of the bushes and inch by inch using the utmost precaution against\nnoise I wormed myself down the steep path.",
    "Only a boulder now separated me from the\ntalking men.",
    "Secure in the blackness I peeped round the edge of it and found myself facing\nthe muzzle of a black murderouslooking automatic\n\u201cHands up\u201d said Mr. Ryland succinctly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d\nHe was seated in the shadow of the rock so that I could not see his face but the menace\nin his voice was unpleasant.",
    "Then I felt a ring of cold steel on the back of my neck and\nRyland lowered his own automatic.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s right George\u201d he drawled.",
    "\u201cMarch him around here.\u201d\nRaging inwardly I was conducted to a spot in the shadows where the unseen George\nwhom I suspected of being the impeccable Deaves gagged and bound me securely.",
    "Ryland spoke again in a tone which I had difficulty in recognizing so cold and\nmenacing was it.",
    "\u201cThis is going to be the end of you two.",
    "You\u2019ve got in the way of the Big Four once too\noften.",
    "Ever heard of landslides There was one about here two years ago.",
    "There\u2019s going to\nbe another tonight.",
    "I\u2019ve fixed that good and square.",
    "Say that friend of yours doesn\u2019t keep his\ndates very punctually.\u201d\nA wave of horror swept over me.",
    "Poirot In another minute he would walk straight into\nthe trap.",
    "And I was powerless to warn him.",
    "I could only pray that he had elected to leave the\nmatter in my hands and had remained in London.",
    "Surely if he had been coming he would\nhave been here by now.",
    "With every minute that passed my hopes rose.",
    "Suddenly they were dashed to pieces.",
    "I heard footsteps\u2014cautious footsteps but\nfootsteps nevertheless.",
    "I writhed in impotent agony.",
    "They came down the path paused and\nthen Poirot himself appeared his head a little on one side peering into the shadows.",
    "I heard the growl of satisfaction Ryland gave as he raised the big automatic and\nshouted \u201cHands up.\u201d Deaves sprang forward as he did so and took Poirot in the rear.",
    "The\nambush was complete.",
    "\u201cPleased to meet you Mr. Hercule Poirot\u201d said the American grimly.",
    "Poirot\u2019s selfpossession was marvellous.",
    "He did not turn a hair.",
    "But I saw his eyes\nsearching in the shadows.",
    "\u201cMy friend He is here\u201d\n\u201cYes you are both in the trap\u2014the trap of the Big Four.\u201d\nHe laughed.",
    "\u201cA trap\u201d queried Poirot.",
    "\u201cSay haven\u2019t you tumbled to it yet\u201d\n\u201cI comprehend that there is a trap\u2014yes\u201d said Poirot gently.",
    "\u201cBut you are in error\nmonsieur.",
    "It is you who are in it\u2014not I and my friend.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d Ryland raised the big automatic but I saw his gaze falter.",
    "\u201cIf you fire you commit murder watched by ten pairs of eyes and you will be hanged\nfor it.",
    "This place is surrounded\u2014has been for the last hour\u2014by Scotland Yard men.",
    "It is\ncheckmate Mr. Abe Ryland.\u201d\nHe uttered a curious whistle and as though by magic the place was alive with men.",
    "They seized Ryland and the valet and disarmed them.",
    "After speaking a few words to the\nofficer in charge Poirot took me by the arm and led me away.",
    "Once clear of the quarry he embraced me with vigour.",
    "\u201cYou are alive\u2014you are unhurt.",
    "It is magnificent.",
    "Often have I blamed myself for\nletting you go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly all right\u201d I said disengaging myself.",
    "\u201cBut I\u2019m just a bit fogged.",
    "You\ntumbled to their little scheme did you\u201d\n\u201cBut I was waiting for it For what else did I permit you to go there Your false name\nyour disguise not for a moment was it intended to deceive\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cYou never told me.\u201d\n\u201cAs I have frequently told you Hastings you have a nature so beautiful and so honest\nthat unless you are yourself deceived it is impossible for you to deceive others.",
    "Good then\nyou are spotted from the first and they do what I had counted on their doing\u2014a\nmathematical certainty to anyone who uses his grey cells properly\u2014use you as a decoy.",
    "They set the girl on\u2014By the way mon ami as an interesting fact psychologically had she\ngot red hair\u201d\n\u201cIf you mean Miss Martin\u201d I said coldly.",
    "\u201cHer hair is a delicate shade of auburn but\n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey are \u00e9patants\u2014these people They have even studied your psychology.",
    "Oh yes\nmy friend Miss Martin was in the plot\u2014very much so.",
    "She repeats the letter to you\ntogether with her tale of Mr. Ryland\u2019s wrath you write it down you puzzle your brains\u2014\nthe cipher is nicely arranged difficult but not too difficult\u2014you solve it and you send for\nme.\u201d\n\u201cBut what they do not know is that I am waiting for just this very thing to happen.",
    "I go\n\n\fposthaste to Japp and arrange things.",
    "And so as you see all is triumph\u201d\nI was not particularly pleased with Poirot and I told him so.",
    "We went back to London\non a milk train in the early hours of the morning and a most uncomfortable journey it was.",
    "I was just out of my bath and indulging in pleasurable thoughts of breakfast when I\nheard Japp\u2019s voice in the sitting room.",
    "I threw on a bathrobe and hurried in.",
    "\u201cA pretty mare\u2019s nest you\u2019ve got us into this time\u201d Japp was saying.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s too bad of\nyou M. Poirot.",
    "First time I\u2019ve ever known you take a toss.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s face was a study.",
    "Japp went on\n\u201cThere were we taking all this Black Hand stuff seriously\u2014and all the time it was the\nfootman.\u201d\n\u201cThe footman\u201d I gasped.",
    "\u201cYes James or whatever his name is.",
    "Seems he laid \u2019em a wager in the servants\u201d hall\nthat he could get taken for the old man by his nibs\u2014that\u2019s you Captain Hastings\u2014and\nwould hand him out a lot of spy stuff about a Big Four gang.\u201d\n\u201cImpossible\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you believe it.",
    "I marched our gentleman straight to Hatton Chase and there was\nthe real Ryland in bed and asleep and the butler and the cook and God knows how many of\nthem to swear to the wager.",
    "Just a silly hoax\u2014that\u2019s all it was\u2014and the valet is with him.\u201d\n\u201cSo that was why he kept in the shadow\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "After Japp had gone we looked at each other.",
    "\u201cWe know Hastings\u201d said Poirot at last.",
    "\u201cNumber Two of the Big Four is Abe Ryland.",
    "The masquerading on the part of the footman was to ensure a way of retreat in case of\nemergencies.",
    "And the footman\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d I breathed.",
    "\u201cNumber Four\u201d said Poirot gravely.",
    "Nine\nTHE YELLOW JASMINE MYSTERY\n\nIt was all very well for Poirot to say that we were acquiring information all the time and\ngaining an insight into our adversaries\u2019 minds\u2014I felt myself that I required some more\ntangible success than this.",
    "Since we had come into contact with the Big Four they had committed two murders\nabducted Halliday and had been within an ace of killing Poirot and myself whereas so far\nwe had hardly scored a point in the game.",
    "Poirot treated my complaints lightly.",
    "\u201cSo far Hastings\u201d he said \u201cthey laugh.",
    "That is true but you have a proverb have you\nnot \u2018He laughs best who laughs at the end\u2019 And at the end mon ami you shall see.\u201d\n\u201cYou must remember too\u201d he added \u201cthat we deal with no ordinary criminal but with\nthe secondgreatest brain in the world.\u201d\nI forebore to pander to his conceit by asking the obvious question.",
    "I knew the answer at\nleast I knew what Poirot\u2019s answer would be and instead I tried without success to elicit\nsome information as to what steps he was taking to track down the enemy.",
    "As usual he had\nkept me completely in the dark as to his movements but I gathered that he was in touch with\nsecret service agents in India China and Russia and from his occasional bursts of selfglorification that he was at least progressing in his favourite game of gauging his enemy\u2019s\nmind.",
    "He had abandoned his private practice almost entirely and I know that at this time he\nrefused some remarkably handsome fees.",
    "True he would sometimes investigate cases which\nintrigued him but he usually dropped them the moment he was convinced that they had no\nconnection with the activities of the Big Four.",
    "This attitude of his was remarkably profitable to our friend Inspector Japp.",
    "Undeniably\nhe gained much kudos for solving several problems in which his success was really due to a\nhalfcontemptuous hint from Poirot.",
    "In return for such service Japp supplied full details of any case which he thought might\ninterest the little Belgian and when he was put in charge of what the newspapers called\n\u201cThe Yellow Jasmine Mystery\u201d he wired Poirot asking him whether he would care to\ncome down and look into the case.",
    "It was in response to this wire that about a month after my adventure in Abe Ryland\u2019s\nhouse we found ourselves alone in a railway compartment whirling away from the smoke\nand dust of London bound for the little town of Market Handford in Worcestershire the seat\nof the mystery.",
    "Poirot leant back in his corner.",
    "\u201cAnd what exactly is your opinion of the affair Hastings\u201d\nI did not at once reply to his question I felt the need of going warily.",
    "\u201cIt all seems so complicated\u201d I said cautiously.",
    "\u201cDoes it not\u201d said Poirot delightedly.",
    "\u201cI suppose our rushing off like this is a pretty clear signal that you consider Mr.\nPaynter\u2019s death to be murder\u2014not suicide or the result of an accident\u201d\n\u201cNo no you misunderstand me Hastings.",
    "Granting that Mr. Paynter died as a result of\na particularly terrible accident there are still a number of mysterious circumstances to be\nexplained.\u201d\n\u201cThat was what I meant when I said it was all so complicated.\u201d\n\u201cLet us go over all the main facts quietly and methodically.",
    "Recount them to me\nHastings in an orderly and lucid fashion.\u201d\nI started forthwith endeavouring to be as orderly and lucid as I could.",
    "\u201cWe start\u201d I said \u201cwith Mr. Paynter.",
    "A man of fiftyfive rich cultured and somewhat\nof a globetrotter.",
    "For the last twelve years he has been little in England but suddenly tiring\nof incessant travelling he bought a small place in Worcestershire near Market Handford\nand prepared to settle down.",
    "His first action was to write to his only relative a nephew\nGerald Paynter the son of his youngest brother and to suggest to him that he should come\nand make his home at Croftlands as the place is called with his uncle.",
    "Gerald Paynter\nwho is an impecunious young artist was glad enough to fall in with the arrangement and\nhad been living with his uncle for about seven months when the tragedy occurred.\u201d\n\u201cYour narrative style is masterly\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cI say to myself it is a book that\ntalks not my friend Hastings.\u201d\nPaying no attention to Poirot I went on warming to the story.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Paynter kept up a fair staff at Croftlands\u2014six servants as well as his own Chinese\nbody servant\u2014Ah Ling.\u201d\n\u201cHis Chinese servant Ah Ling\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cOn Tuesday last Mr. Paynter complained of feeling unwell after dinner and one of the\nservants was despatched to fetch the doctor.",
    "Mr. Paynter received the doctor in his study\nhaving refused to go to bed.",
    "What passed between them was not then known but before\nDoctor Quentin left he asked to see the housekeeper and mentioned that he had given Mr.\nPaynter a hypodermic injection as his heart was in a very weak state recommended that he\nshould not be disturbed and then proceeded to ask some rather curious questions about the\nservants how long they had been there from whom they had come etc.",
    "\u201cThe housekeeper answered these questions as best she could but was rather puzzled\nas to their purport.",
    "A terrible discovery was made on the following morning.",
    "One of the\nhousemaids on descending was met by a sickening odour of burned flesh which seemed to\ncome from her master\u2019s study.",
    "She tried the door but it was locked on the inside.",
    "With the\nassistance of Gerald Paynter and the Chinaman that was soon broken in but a terrible sight\n\n\fgreeted them.",
    "Mr. Paynter had fallen forward into the gas fire and his face and head were\ncharred beyond recognition.",
    "\u201cOf course at the moment no suspicion was aroused as to its being anything but a\nghastly accident.",
    "If blame attached to anyone it was to Doctor Quentin for giving his patient\na narcotic and leaving him in such a dangerous position.",
    "And then a rather curious discovery\nwas made.",
    "\u201cThere was a newspaper on the floor lying where it had slipped from the old man\u2019s\nknees.",
    "On turning it over words were found to be scrawled across it feebly traced in ink.",
    "A\nwriting table stood close to the chair in which Mr. Paynter had been sitting and the\nforefinger of the victim\u2019s right hand was inkstained up to the second joint.",
    "It was clear that\ntoo weak to hold a pen Mr. Paynter had dipped his finger in the inkpot and managed to\nscrawl these two words across the surface of the newspaper he held\u2014but the words\nthemselves seemed utterly fantastic Yellow Jasmine\u2014just that and nothing more.",
    "\u201cCroftlands has a large quantity of yellow jasmine growing up its walls and it was\nthought that this dying message had some reference to them showing that the poor old man\u2019s\nmind was wandering.",
    "Of course the newspapers agog for anything out of the common took\nup the story hotly calling it the Mystery of the Yellow Jasmine\u2014though in all probability\nthe words are completely unimportant.\u201d\n\u201cThey are unimportant you say\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cWell doubtless since you say so it\nmust be so.\u201d\nI regarded him dubiously but I could detect no mockery in his eye.",
    "\u201cAnd then\u201d I continued \u201cthere came the excitements of the inquest.\u201d\n\u201cThis is where you lick your lips I perceive.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a certain amount of feeling evidenced against Dr. Quentin.",
    "To begin with\nhe was not the regular doctor only a locum putting in a month\u2019s work whilst Dr. Bolitho\nwas away on a wellearned holiday.",
    "Then it was felt that his carelessness was the direct\ncause of the accident.",
    "But his evidence was little short of sensational.",
    "Mr. Paynter had been\nailing in health since his arrival at Croftlands.",
    "Dr. Bolitho had attended him for some time\nbut when Dr. Quentin first saw his patient he was mystified by some of the symptoms.",
    "He\nhad only attended him once before the night when he was sent for after dinner.",
    "As soon as he\nwas alone with Mr. Paynter the latter had unfolded a surprising tale.",
    "To begin with he was\nnot feeling ill at all he explained but the taste of some curry that he had been eating at\ndinner had struck him as peculiar.",
    "Making an excuse to get rid of Ah Ling for a few minutes\nhe had turned the contents of his plate into a bowl and he now handed it over to the doctor\nwith injunctions to find out if there were really anything wrong with it.",
    "\u201cIn spite of his statement that he was not feeling ill the doctor noted that the shock of\nhis suspicions had evidently affected him and that his heart was feeling it.",
    "Accordingly he\nadministered an injection\u2014not of a narcotic but of strychnine.",
    "\u201cThat I think completes the case\u2014except for the crux of the whole thing\u2014the fact that\nthe uneaten curry duly analysed was found to contain enough powdered opium to have\nkilled two men\u201d\n\n\fI paused.",
    "\u201cAnd your conclusions Hastings\u201d asked Poirot quietly.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say.",
    "It might be an accident\u2014the fact that someone attempted to poison\nhim the same night might be merely a coincidence.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t think so You prefer to believe it\u2014murder\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cMon ami you and I do not reason in the same way.",
    "I am not trying to make up my mind\nbetween two opposite solutions\u2014murder or accident\u2014that will come when we have\nsolved the other problem\u2014the mystery of the \u2018Yellow Jasmine.\u2019 By the way you have left\nout something there.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the two lines at right angles to each other faintly indicated under the words\nI did not think they could be of any possible importance.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you think is always so important to yourself Hastings.",
    "But let us pass from the\nMystery of the Yellow Jasmine to the Mystery of the Curry.\u201d\n\u201cI know.",
    "Who poisoned it Why There are a hundred questions one can ask.",
    "Ah Ling\nof course prepared it.",
    "But why should he wish to kill his master Is he a member of a tong\nor something like that One reads of such things.",
    "The tong of the Yellow Jasmine perhaps.",
    "Then there is Gerald Paynter.\u201d\nI came to an abrupt pause.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot nodding his head.",
    "\u201cThere is Gerald Paynter as you say.",
    "He is his\nuncle\u2019s heir.",
    "He was dining out that night though.\u201d\n\u201cHe might have got at some of the ingredients of the curry\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cAnd he would\ntake care to be out so as not to have to partake of the dish.\u201d\nI think my reasoning rather impressed Poirot.",
    "He looked at me with a more respectful\nattention than he had given me so far.",
    "\u201cHe returns late\u201d I mused pursuing a hypothetical case.",
    "\u201cSees the light in his uncle\u2019s\nstudy enters and finding his plan has failed thrusts the old man down into the fire.\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Paynter who was a fairly hearty man of fiftyfive would not permit himself to be\nburnt to death without a struggle Hastings.",
    "Such a reconstruction is not feasible.\u201d\n\u201cWell Poirot\u201d I cried \u201cwe\u2019re nearly there I fancy.",
    "Let us hear what you think\u201d\nPoirot threw me a smile swelled out his chest and began in a pompous manner.",
    "\u201cAssuming murder the question at once arises why choose that particular method I\ncan think of only one reason\u2014to confuse identity the face being charred beyond\nrecognition.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cYou think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA moment\u2019s patience Hastings.",
    "I was going on to say that I examine that theory.",
    "Is\nthere any ground for believing that the body is not that of Mr. Paynter Is there anyone else\n\n\fwhose body it possibly could be I examine these two questions and finally I answer them\nboth in the negative.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d I said rather disappointed.",
    "\u201cAnd then\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s eyes twinkled a little.",
    "\u201cAnd then I say to myself \u2018since there is here something that I do not understand it\nwould be well that I should investigate the matter.",
    "I must not permit myself to be wholly\nengrossed by the Big Four.\u2019 Ah We are just arriving.",
    "My little clothes brush where does it\nhide itself Here it is\u2014brush me down I pray you my friend and then I will perform the\nsame service for you.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully as he put away the brush \u201cone must not permit oneself\nto be obsessed by one idea.",
    "I have been in danger of that.",
    "Figure to yourself my friend that\neven here in this case I am in danger of it.",
    "Those two lines you mentioned a downstroke\nand a line at right angles to it what are they but the beginning of a 4\u201d\n\u201cGood gracious Poirot\u201d I cried laughing.",
    "\u201cIs it not absurd I see the hand of the Big Four everywhere it is well to employ one\u2019s\nwits in a totally different milieu.",
    "Ah There is Japp come to meet us.\u201d\n\n\fTen\nWE INVESTIGATE AT CROFTLANDS\n\nThe Scotland Yard Inspector was indeed waiting on the platform and greeted us warmly.",
    "\u201cWell Moosior Poirot this is good.",
    "Thought you\u2019d like to be let in on this.",
    "Tiptop\nmystery isn\u2019t it\u201d\nI read this aright as showing Japp to be completely puzzled and hoping to pick up a\npointer from Poirot.",
    "Japp had a car waiting and we drove up in it to Croftlands.",
    "It was a square white\nhouse quite unpretentious and covered with creepers including the starry yellow jasmine.",
    "Japp looked up at it as we did.",
    "\u201cMust have been balmy to go writing that poor old cove\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cHallucinations perhaps and thought he was outside.\u201d\nPoirot was smiling at him.",
    "\u201cWhich was it my good Japp\u201d he asked \u201caccident or murder\u201d\nThe Inspector seemed a little embarrassed by the question.",
    "\u201cWell if it weren\u2019t for that curry business I\u2019d be for accident every time.",
    "There\u2019s no\nsense in holding a live man\u2019s head in the fire\u2014why he\u2019d scream the house down.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot in a low voice.",
    "\u201cFool that I have been.",
    "Triple imbecile You are a\ncleverer man than I am Japp.\u201d\nJapp was rather taken aback by the compliment\u2014Poirot being usually given to\nexclusive selfpraise.",
    "He reddened and muttered something about there being a lot of doubt\nabout that.",
    "He led the way through the house to the room where the tragedy had occurred\u2014Mr.",
    "Paynter\u2019s study.",
    "It was a wide low room with booklined walls and big leather armchairs.",
    "Poirot looked across at once to the window which gave upon a gravelled terrace.",
    "\u201cThe window was it unlatched\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of course.",
    "When the doctor left this room he merely closed the\ndoor behind him.",
    "The next morning it was found locked.",
    "Who locked it Mr. Paynter Ah\nLing declares that the window was closed and bolted.",
    "Dr. Quentin on the other hand has an\nimpression that it was closed but not fastened but he won\u2019t swear either way.",
    "If he could it\nwould make a great difference.",
    "If the man was murdered someone entered the room either\nthrough the door or the window\u2014if through the door it was an inside job if through the\nwindow it might have been anyone.",
    "First thing when they had broken the door down they\nflung the window open and the housemaid who did it thinks that it wasn\u2019t fastened but\n\n\fshe\u2019s a precious bad witness\u2014will remember anything you ask her to\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the key\u201d\n\u201cThere you are again.",
    "It was on the floor among the wreckage of the door.",
    "Might have\nfallen from the keyhole might have been dropped there by one of the people who entered\nmight have been slipped underneath the door from the outside.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact everything is \u2018might have been\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hit it Moosior Poirot.",
    "That\u2019s just what it is.\u201d\nPoirot was looking around him frowning unhappily.",
    "\u201cI cannot see light\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cJust now\u2014yes I got a gleam but now all is\ndarkness once more.",
    "I have not the clue\u2014the motive.\u201d\n\u201cYoung Gerald Paynter had a pretty good motive\u201d remarked Japp grimly.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s been\nwild enough in his time I can tell you.",
    "And extravagant.",
    "You know what artists are too\u2014no\nmorals at all.\u201d\nPoirot did not pay much attention to Japp\u2019s sweeping strictures on the artistic\ntemperament.",
    "Instead he smiled knowingly.",
    "\u201cMy good Japp is it possible that you throw me the mud in my eyes I know well\nenough that it is the Chinaman you suspect.",
    "But you are so artful.",
    "You want me to help you\u2014\nand yet you drag the red kipper across the trail.\u201d\nJapp burst out laughing.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s you all over Mr. Poirot.",
    "Yes I\u2019d bet on the Chink I\u2019ll admit it now.",
    "It stands\nto reason that it was he who doctored the curry and if he\u2019d try once in an evening to get his\nmaster out of the way he\u2019d try twice.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder if he would\u201d said Poirot softly.",
    "\u201cBut it\u2019s the motive that beats me.",
    "Some heathen revenge or other I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder\u201d said Poirot again.",
    "\u201cThere has been no robbery Nothing has disappeared\nNo jewellery or money or papers\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014that is not exactly.\u201d\nI pricked up my ears so did Poirot.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s been no robbery I mean\u201d explained Japp.",
    "\u201cBut the old boy was writing a\nbook of some sort.",
    "We only knew about it this morning when there was a letter from the\npublishers asking about the manuscript.",
    "It was just completed it seems.",
    "Young Paynter and I\nhave searched high and low but can\u2019t find a trace of it\u2014he must have hidden it away\nsomewhere.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s eyes were shining with the green light I knew so well.",
    "\u201cHow was it called this book\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cThe Hidden Hand in China I think it was called.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAha\u201d said Poirot with almost a gasp.",
    "Then he said quickly \u201cLet me see the\nChinaman Ah Ling.\u201d\nThe Chinaman was sent for and appeared shuffling along with his eyes cast down and\nhis pigtail swinging.",
    "His impassive face showed no trace of any kind of emotion.",
    "\u201cAh Ling\u201d said Poirot \u201care you sorry your master is dead\u201d\n\u201cI welly sorry.",
    "He good master.\u201d\n\u201cYou know who kill him\u201d\n\u201cI not know.",
    "I tell pleeceman if I know.\u201d\nThe questions and answers went on.",
    "With the same impassive face Ah Ling described\nhow he had made the curry.",
    "The cook had had nothing to do with it he declared no hand\nhad touched it but his own.",
    "I wondered if he saw where his admission was leading him.",
    "He\nstuck to it too that the window to the garden was bolted that evening.",
    "If it was open in the\nmorning his master must have opened it himself.",
    "At last Poirot dismissed him.",
    "\u201cThat will do Ah Ling.\u201d Just as the Chinaman had got to the door Poirot recalled him.",
    "\u201cAnd you know nothing you say of the Yellow Jasmine\u201d\n\u201cNo what should I know\u201d\n\u201cNor yet of the sign that was written underneath it\u201d\nPoirot leaned forward as he spoke and quickly traced something on the dust of a little\ntable.",
    "I was near enough to see it before he rubbed it out.",
    "A down stroke a line at right\nangles and then a second line down which completed a big 4.",
    "The effect on the Chinaman\nwas electrical.",
    "For one moment his face was a mask of terror.",
    "Then as suddenly it was\nimpassive again and repeating his grave disclaimer he withdrew.",
    "Japp departed in search of young Paynter and Poirot and I were left alone together.",
    "\u201cThe Big Four Hastings\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cOnce again the Big Four.",
    "Paynter was a great\ntraveller.",
    "In his book there was doubtless some vital information concerning the doings of\nNumber One Li Chang Yen the head and brains of the Big Four.\u201d\n\u201cBut who\u2014how\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHush here they come.\u201d\nGerald Paynter was an amiable rather weaklooking young man.",
    "He had a soft brown\nbeard and a peculiar flowing tie.",
    "He answered Poirot\u2019s questions readily enough.",
    "\u201cI dined out with some neighbours of ours the Wycherleys\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cWhat time\ndid I get home Oh about eleven.",
    "I had a latchkey you know.",
    "All the servants had gone to\nbed and I naturally thought my uncle had done the same.",
    "As a matter of fact I did think I\ncaught sight of that softfooted Chinese beggar Ah Ling just whisking round the corner of\nthe hall but I fancy I was mistaken.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you last see your uncle Mr. Paynter I mean before you came to live with\nhim\u201d\n\u201cOh not since I was a kid of ten.",
    "He and his brother my father quarrelled you know.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cBut he found you again with very little trouble did he not In spite of all the years that\nhad passed\u201d\n\u201cYes it was quite a bit of luck my seeing the lawyer\u2019s advertisement.\u201d\nPoirot asked no more questions.",
    "Our next move was to visit Dr. Quentin.",
    "His story was substantially the same as he had\ntold at the inquest and he had little to add to it.",
    "He received us in his surgery having just\ncome to the end of his consulting patients.",
    "He seemed an intelligent man.",
    "A certain primness\nof manner went well with his pincenez but I fancied that he would be thoroughly modern in\nhis methods.",
    "\u201cI wish I could remember about the window\u201d he said frankly.",
    "\u201cBut it\u2019s dangerous to\nthink back one becomes quite positive about something that never existed.",
    "That\u2019s\npsychology isn\u2019t it M. Poirot You see I\u2019ve read all about your methods and I may say\nI\u2019m an enormous admirer of yours.",
    "No I suppose it\u2019s pretty certain that the Chinaman put the\npowdered opium in the curry but he\u2019ll never admit it and we shall never know why.",
    "But\nholding a man down in a fire\u2014that\u2019s not in keeping with our Chinese friend\u2019s character it\nseems to me.\u201d\nI commented on this last point to Poirot as we walked down the main street of Market\nHandford.",
    "\u201cDo you think he let a confederate in\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cBy the way I suppose Japp can be\ntrusted to keep an eye on him\u201d The Inspector had passed into the police station on some\nbusiness or other.",
    "\u201cThe emissaries of the Big Four are pretty spry.\u201d\n\u201cJapp is keeping an eye on both of them\u201d said Poirot grimly.",
    "\u201cThey have been closely\nshadowed ever since the body was discovered.\u201d\n\u201cWell at any rate we know that Gerald Paynter had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\u201cYou always know so much more than I do Hastings that it becomes quite fatiguing.\u201d\n\u201cYou old fox\u201d I laughed.",
    "\u201cYou never will commit yourself.\u201d\n\u201cTo be honest Hastings the case is now quite clear to me\u2014all but the words Yellow\nJasmine\u2014and I am coming to agree with you that they have no bearing on the crime.",
    "In a\ncase of this kind you have got to make up your mind who is lying.",
    "I have done that.",
    "And yet\n\u2014\u201d\nHe suddenly darted from my side and entered an adjacent bookshop.",
    "He emerged a few\nminutes later hugging a parcel.",
    "Then Japp rejoined us and we all sought quarters at the inn.",
    "I slept late the next morning.",
    "When I descended to the sitting room reserved for us I\nfound Poirot already there pacing up and down his face contorted with agony.",
    "\u201cDo not converse with me\u201d he cried waving an agitated hand.",

    "There was no trace of powdered opium in the curry\nserved to Mr. Paynter but acting in obedience to the suspicions Dr. Quentin had aroused\nthe old man eats none of it and preserves it to give to his medical attendant whom he\n\n\fsummons according to plan.",
    "Dr. Quentin arrives takes charge of the curry and gives Mr.\nPaynter an injection\u2014of strychnine he says but really of yellow jasmine\u2014a poisonous\ndose.",
    "When the drug begins to take effect he departs after unlatching the window.",
    "Then in\nthe night he returns by the window finds the manuscript and shoves Mr. Paynter into the\nfire.",
    "He does not heed the newspaper that drops to the floor and is covered by the old man\u2019s\nbody.",
    "Paynter knew what drug he had been given and strove to accuse the Big Four of his\nmurder.",
    "It is easy for Quentin to mix powdered opium with the curry before handing it over\nto be analysed.",
    "He gives his version of the conversation with the old man and mentions the\nstrychnine injection casually in case the mark of the hypodermic needle is noticed.",
    "Suspicion at once is divided between accident and the guilt of Ah Ling owing to the poison\nof the curry.\u201d\n\u201cBut Dr. Quentin cannot be Number Four\u201d\n\u201cI fancy he can.",
    "There is undoubtedly a real Dr. Quentin who is probably abroad\nsomewhere.",
    "Number Four has simply masqueraded as him for a short time.",
    "The\narrangements with Dr. Bolitho were all carried out by correspondence the man who was to\ndo locum orginally having been taken ill at the last minute.\u201d\nAt that minute Japp burst in very red in the face.",
    "\u201cHave you got him\u201d cried Poirot anxiously.",
    "Japp shook his head very out of breath.",
    "\u201cBolitho came back from his holiday this morning\u2014recalled by telegram.",
    "No one\nknows who sent it.",
    "The other man left last night.",
    "We\u2019ll catch him yet though.\u201d\nPoirot shook his head quietly.",

    "Eleven\nA CHESS PROBLEM\n\nPoirot and I often dined at a small restaurant in Soho.",
    "We were there one evening when we\nobserved a friend at an adjacent table.",
    "It was Inspector Japp and as there was room at our\ntable he came and joined us.",
    "It was some time since either of us had seen him.",
    "\u201cNever do you drop in to see us nowadays\u201d declared Poirot reproachfully.",
    "\u201cNot since\nthe affair of the Yellow Jasmine have we met and that is nearly a month ago.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been up north\u2014that\u2019s why.",
    "How are things with you Big Four still going strong\n\u2014eh\u201d\nPoirot shook a finger at him reproachfully.",

    "Dr. Savaronoff the Russian champion was one of the players and\nthe other who succumbed to heart failure was the brilliant young American Gilmour\nWilson.\u201d\n\u201cQuite right.",
    "Savaronoff beat Rubinstein and became Russian champion some years\nago.",
    "Wilson was said to be a second Capablanca.\u201d\n\u201cA very curious occurrence\u201d mused Poirot.",
    "\u201cIf I mistake not you have a particular\ninterest in the matter\u201d\nJapp gave a rather embarrassed laugh.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve hit it Moosior Poirot.",
    "I\u2019m puzzled.",
    "Wilson was sound as a bell\u2014no trace of\nheart trouble.",
    "His death is quite inexplicable.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou suspect Dr. Savaronoff of putting him out of the way\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cHardly that\u201d said Japp dryly.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think even a Russian would murder another man\nin order not to be beaten at chess\u2014and anyway from all I can make out the boot was likely\nto be on the other leg.",
    "The doctor is supposed to be very hot stuff\u2014second to Lasker they\nsay he is.\u201d\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cThen what exactly is your little idea\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cWhy should Wilson be poisoned\nFor I assume of course that it is poison you suspect.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.",
    "Heart failure means your heart stops beating\u2014that\u2019s all there is to that.",
    "That\u2019s what a doctor says officially at the moment but privately he tips us the wink that he\u2019s\nnot satisfied.\u201d\n\u201cWhen is the autopsy to take place\u201d\n\u201cTonight.",
    "Wilson\u2019s death was extraordinarily sudden.",
    "He seemed quite as usual and\nwas actually moving one of the pieces when he suddenly fell forward\u2014dead\u201d\n\u201cThere are very few poisons would act in such a fashion\u201d objected Poirot.",
    "\u201cI know.",
    "The autopsy will help us I expect.",
    "But why should anyone want Gilmour\nWilson out of the way\u2014that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know Harmless unassuming young fellow.",
    "Just come over here from the States and apparently hadn\u2019t an enemy in the world.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems incredible\u201d I mused.",

    "Savaronoff fell foul of the Bolsheviks at the outbreak of the Revolution.",
    "He was\neven reported killed.",
    "In reality he escaped and for three years endured incredible hardships\nin the wilds of Siberia.",
    "His sufferings were so great that he is now a changed man.",
    "His\nfriends and acquaintances declare they would hardly have recognized him.",
    "His hair is\nwhite and his whole aspect that of a man terribly aged.",
    "He is a semiinvalid and seldom\ngoes out living alone with a niece Sonia Daviloff and a Russian manservant in a flat down\nWestminster way.",
    "It is possible that he still considers himself a marked man.",
    "Certainly he\nwas very unwilling to agree to this chess contest.",
    "He refused several times point blank and\nit was only when the newspapers took it up and began making a fuss about the\n\u2018unsportsmanlike refusal\u2019 that he gave in.",
    "Gilmour Wilson had gone on challenging him with\nreal Yankee pertinacity and in the end he got his way.",

    "Didn\u2019t want somebody\nor other to get on his track.",
    "That\u2019s my solution\u2014Gilmour Wilson got pipped by mistake.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no one who has any private reason to gain by Savaronoff\u2019s death\u201d\n\u201cWell his niece I suppose.",
    "He\u2019s recently come into an immense fortune.",
    "Left him by\nMadame Gospoja whose husband was a sugar profiteer under the old regime.",
    "They had an\n\n\faffair together once I believe and she refused steadfastly to credit the reports of his death.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did the match take place\u201d\n\u201cIn Savaronoff\u2019s own flat.",
    "He\u2019s an invalid as I told you.\u201d\n\u201cMany people there to watch it\u201d\n\u201cAt least a dozen\u2014probably more.\u201d\nPoirot made an expressive grimace.",
    "\u201cMy poor Japp your task is not an easy one.\u201d\n\u201cOnce I know definitely that Wilson was poisoned I can get on.\u201d\n\u201cHas it occurred to you that in the meantime supposing your assumption that\nSavaronoff was the intended victim to be correct the murderer may try again\u201d\n\u201cOf course it has.",
    "Two men are watching Savaronoff\u2019s flat.\u201d\n\u201cThat will be very useful if anyone should call with a bomb under his arm\u201d said Poirot\ndryly.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re getting interested Moosior Poirot\u201d said Japp with a twinkle.",
    "\u201cCare to come\nround to the mortuary and see Wilson\u2019s body before the doctors start on it Who knows his\ntie pin may be askew and that may give you a valuable clue that will solve the mystery.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Japp all through dinner my fingers have been itching to rearrange your own\ntie pin.",
    "You permit yes Ah that is much more pleasing to the eye.",
    "Yes by all means let us\ngo to the mortuary.\u201d\nI could see that Poirot\u2019s attention was completely captivated by this new problem.",
    "It\nwas so long since he had shown any interest over any outside case that I was quite rejoiced\nto see him back in his old form.",
    "For my own part I felt a deep pity as I looked down upon the motionless form and\nconvulsed face of the hapless young American who had come by his death in such a strange\nway.",
    "Poirot examined the body attentively.",
    "There was no mark on it anywhere except a\nsmall scar on the left hand.",
    "\u201cAnd the doctor says that\u2019s a burn not a cut\u201d explained Japp.",
    "Poirot\u2019s attention shifted to the contents of the dead man\u2019s pockets which a constable\nspread out for our inspection.",
    "There was nothing much\u2014a handkerchief keys notecase\nfilled with notes and some unimportant letters.",
    "But one object standing by itself filled\nPoirot with interest.",
    "\u201cA chessman\u201d he exclaimed.",
    "\u201cA white bishop.",
    "Was that in his pocket\u201d\n\u201cNo clasped in his hand.",
    "We had quite a difficulty to get it out of his fingers.",
    "It must be\nreturned to Dr. Savaronoff sometime.",
    "It\u2019s part of a very beautiful set of carved ivory\nchessmen.\u201d\n\u201cPermit me to return it to him.",
    "It will make an excuse for my going there.\u201d\n\u201cAha\u201d cried Japp.",
    "\u201cSo you want to come in on this case\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI admit it.",
    "So skilfully have you aroused my interest.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine.",
    "Got you away from your brooding.",
    "Captain Hastings is pleased too I can\nsee.\u201d\n\u201cQuite right\u201d I said laughing.",
    "Poirot turned back towards the body.",
    "\u201cNo other little detail you can tell me about\u2014him\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cNot even\u2014that he was lefthanded\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a wizard Moosior Poirot.",
    "How did you know that He was lefthanded.",
    "Not\nthat it\u2019s anything to do with the case.\u201d\n\u201cNothing whatever\u201d agreed Poirot hastily seeing that Japp was slightly ruffled.",
    "\u201cMy\nlittle joke\u2014that was all.",
    "I like to play you the trick see you.\u201d\nWe went out upon an amicable understanding.",
    "The following morning saw us wending our way to Dr. Savaronoff\u2019s flat in\nWestminster.",
    "\u201cSonia Daviloff\u201d I mused.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty name.\u201d\nPoirot stopped and threw me a look of despair.",
    "\u201cAlways looking for romance You are incorrigible.",
    "It would serve you right if Sonia\nDaviloff turned out to be our friend and enemy the Countess Vera Rossakoff.\u201d\nAt the mention of the countess my face clouded over.",
    "\u201cSurely Poirot you don\u2019t suspect\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut no no.",
    "It was a joke I have not the Big Four on the brain to that extent whatever\nJapp may say.\u201d\nThe door of the flat was opened to us by a manservant with a peculiarly wooden face.",
    "It\nseemed impossible to believe that that impassive countenance could ever display emotion.",
    "Poirot presented a card on which Japp had scribbled a few words of introduction and\nwe were shown into a low long room furnished with rich hangings and curios.",
    "One or two\nwonderful ikons hung upon the walls and exquisite Persian rugs lay upon the floor.",
    "A\nsamovar stood upon a table.",
    "I was examining one of the ikons which I judged to be of considerable value and turned\nto see Poirot prone upon the floor.",
    "Beautiful as the rug was it hardly seemed to me to\nnecessitate such close attention.",
    "\u201cIs it such a very wonderful specimen\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cEh Oh the rug But no it was not the rug I was remarking.",
    "But it is a beautiful\nspecimen far too beautiful to have a large nail wantonly driven through the middle of it.",
    "No\nHastings\u201d as I came forward \u201cthe nail is not there now.",
    "But the hole remains.\u201d\n\n\fA sudden sound behind us made me spin round and Poirot sprang nimbly to his feet.",
    "A\ngirl was standing in the doorway.",
    "Her eyes full upon us were dark with suspicion.",
    "She was\nof medium height with a beautiful rather sullen face dark blue eyes and very black hair\nwhich was cut short.",
    "Her voice when she spoke was rich and sonorous and completely unEnglish.",
    "\u201cI fear my uncle will be unable to see you.",
    "He is a great invalid.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a pity but perhaps you will kindly help me instead.",
    "You are Mademoiselle\nDaviloff are you not\u201d\n\u201cYes I am Sonia Daviloff.",
    "What is it you want to know\u201d\n\u201cI am making some inquiries about that sad affair the night before last\u2014the death of M.\nGilmour Wilson.",
    "What can you tell me about it\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s eyes opened wide.",
    "\u201cHe died of heart failure\u2014as he was playing chess.\u201d\n\u201cThe police are not so sure that it was\u2014heart failure mademoiselle.\u201d\nThe girl gave a terrified gesture.",
    "\u201cIt was true then\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cIvan was right.\u201d\n\u201cWho is Ivan and why do you say he was right\u201d\n\u201cIt was Ivan who opened the door to you\u2014and he has already said to me that in his\nopinion Gilmour Wilson did not die a natural death\u2014that he was poisoned by mistake.\u201d\n\u201cBy mistake.\u201d\n\u201cYes the poison was meant for my uncle.\u201d\nShe had quite forgotten her first distrust now and was speaking eagerly.",
    "\u201cWhy do you say that mademoiselle Who should wish to poison Dr. Savaronoff\u201d\nShe shook her head.",
    "\u201cI do not know.",
    "I am in the dark.",
    "And my uncle he will not trust me.",
    "It is natural\nperhaps.",
    "You see he hardly knows me.",
    "He saw me as a child and not since till I came to\nlive with him here in London.",
    "But this much I do know he is in fear of something.",
    "We have\nmany secret societies in Russia and one day I overheard something which made me think it\nwas of just such a society he went in fear.",
    "Tell me monsieur\u201d\u2014she came a step nearer and\ndropped her voice\u2014\u201chave you ever heard of a society called the \u2018Big Four\u2019\u201d\nPoirot jumped nearly out of his skin.",
    "His eyes positively bulged with astonishment.",
    "\u201cWhy do you\u2014what do you know of the Big Four mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cThere is such an association then I overheard a reference to them and asked my\nuncle about it afterwards.",
    "Never have I seen a man so afraid.",
    "He turned all white and\nshaking.",
    "He was in fear of them monsieur in great fear I am sure of it.",
    "And by mistake\nthey killed the American Wilson.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThe Big Four\u201d murmured Poirot.",

    "Now recount to me exactly the\nevents of that fatal evening.",
    "Show me the chessboard the table how the two men sat\u2014\neverything.\u201d\nShe went to the side of the room and brought out a small table.",
    "The top of it was\nexquisite inlaid with squares of silver and black to represent a chessboard.",
    "\u201cThis was sent to my uncle a few weeks ago as a present with the request that he\nwould use it in the next match he played.",
    "It was in the middle of the room\u2014so.\u201d\nPoirot examined the table with what seemed to me quite unnecessary attention.",
    "He was\nnot conducting the inquiry at all as I would have done.",
    "Many of the questions seemed to me\npointless and upon really vital matters he seemed to have no questions to ask.",
    "I concluded\nthat the unexpected mention of the Big Four had thrown him completely off his balance.",
    "After a minute examination of the table and the exact position it had occupied he asked\nto see the chessmen.",
    "Sonia Daviloff brought them to him in a box.",
    "He examined one or two\nof them in a perfunctory manner.",
    "\u201cAn exquisite set\u201d he murmured absentmindedly.",
    "Still not a question as to what refreshments there had been or what people had been\npresent.",
    "I cleared my throat significantly.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you think Poirot that\u2014\u201d\nHe interrupted me peremptorily.",
    "\u201cDo not think my friend.",
    "Leave all to me.",
    "Mademoiselle is it quite impossible that I\nshould see your uncle\u201d\nA faint smile showed itself on her face.",
    "\u201cHe will see you yes.",
    "You understand it is my part to interview all strangers first.\u201d\nShe disappeared.",
    "I heard a murmur of voices in the next room and a minute later she\ncame back and motioned us to pass into the adjoining room.",
    "The man who lay there on a couch was an imposing figure.",
    "Tall gaunt with huge bushy\neyebrows and white beard and a face haggard as the result of starvation and hardships Dr.\nSavaronoff was a distinct personality.",
    "I noted the peculiar formation of his head its unusual\nheight.",
    "A great chess player must have a great brain I knew.",
    "I could easily understand Dr.\nSavaronoff being the second greatest player in the world.",
    "Poirot bowed.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "le Docteur may I speak to you alone\u201d\nSavaronoff turned to his niece.",
    "\u201cLeave us Sonia.\u201d\nShe disappeared obediently.",
    "\u201cNow sir what is it\u201d\n\u201cDr.",
    "Savaronoff you have recently come into an enormous fortune.",
    "If you should\u2014die\nunexpectedly who inherits it\u201d\n\u201cI have made a will leaving everything to my niece Sonia Daviloff.",
    "You do not suggest\n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI suggest nothing but you have not seen your niece since she was a child.",
    "It would\nhave been easy for anyone to impersonate her.\u201d\nSavaronoff seemed thunderstruck by the suggestion.",
    "Poirot went on easily.",
    "\u201cEnough as to that I give you the word of warning that is all.",
    "What I want you to do\nnow is to describe to me the game of chess the other evening.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you mean\u2014describe it\u201d\n\u201cWell I do not play the chess myself but I understand that there are various regular\nways of beginning\u2014the gambit do they not call it\u201d\nDr. Savaronoff smiled a little.",
    "\u201cAh I comprehend you now.",
    "Wilson opened Ruy Lopez\u2014one of the soundest openings\nthere is and one frequently adopted in tournaments and matches.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how long had you been playing when the tragedy happened\u201d\n\u201cIt must have been about the third or fourth move when Wilson suddenly fell forward\nover the table stone dead.\u201d\nPoirot rose to depart.",
    "He flung out his last question as though it was of absolutely no\nimportance but I knew better.",
    "\u201cHad he anything to eat or drink\u201d\n\u201cA whisky and soda I think.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Dr. Savaronoff.",
    "I will disturb you no longer.\u201d\nIvan was in the hall to show us out.",

    "It has been let furnished lately\nthough.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nWe went out into the bright winter sunlight.",
    "\u201cWell really Poirot\u201d I burst out.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve distinguished yourself this time.",
    "Surely your questions were very inadequate.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so Hastings\u201d Poirot looked at me appealingly.",
    "\u201cI was boulevers\u00e9 yes.",
    "What would you have asked\u201d\nI considered the question carefully and then outlined my scheme to Poirot.",
    "He listened\nwith what seemed to be close interest.",
    "My monologue lasted until we had nearly reached\n\n\fhome.",
    "\u201cVery excellent very searching Hastings\u201d said Poirot as he inserted his key in the\ndoor and preceded me up the stairs.",
    "\u201cBut quite unnecessary.\u201d\n\u201cUnnecessary\u201d I cried amazed.",
    "\u201cIf the man was poisoned\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAha\u201d cried Poirot pouncing upon a note which lay on the table.",
    "\u201cFrom Japp.",
    "Just as I\nthought.\u201d He flung it over to me.",
    "It was brief and to the point.",
    "No traces of poison had been\nfound and there was nothing to show how the man came by his death.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d said Poirot \u201cour questions would have been quite unnecessary.\u201d\n\u201cYou guessed this beforehand\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Forecast the probable result of the deal\u2019\u201d quoted Poirot from a recent bridge\nproblem on which I had spent much time.",

    "In all\nprobability Number Four did not even know the rudiments of the game.",

    "He tried all he knew to avoid the contest.",
    "When that failed\nWilson\u2019s doom was sealed.",
    "At all costs he must be prevented from discovering that the\ngreat Savaronoff did not even know how to play chess.",
    "Wilson was fond of the Ruy Lopez\nopening and was certain to use it.",
    "Number Four arranged for death to come with the third\nmove before any complications of defence set in.\u201d\n\u201cBut my dear Poirot\u201d I persisted \u201care we dealing with a lunatic I quite follow your\nreasoning and admit that you must be right but to kill a man just to sustain his role Surely\nthere were simpler ways out of the difficulty than that He could have said that his doctor\nforbade the strain of a match.\u201d\nPoirot wrinkled his forehead.",
    "\u201cCertainement Hastings\u201d he said \u201cthere were other ways but none so convincing.",
    "Besides you are assuming that to kill a man is a thing to avoid are you not Number Four\u2019s\nmind it does not act that way.",
    "I put myself in his place a thing impossible for you.",
    "I picture\nhis thoughts.",

    "He is aware that two moves\nare all that he knows\u2014and all that he need know.",
    "Again it would appeal to his mind to\nforesee the time that suits Number Four \u2026 Oh yes Hastings I begin to understand our\nfriend and his psychology.\u201d\nI shrugged.",
    "\u201cWell I suppose you\u2019re right but I can\u2019t understand anyone running a risk he could so\neasily avoid.\u201d\n\u201cRisk\u201d Poirot snorted.",
    "\u201cWhere then lay the risk Would Japp have solved the\nproblem No if Number Four had not made one small mistake he would have run no risk.\u201d\n\u201cAnd his mistake\u201d I asked although I suspected the answer.",
    "\u201cMon ami he overlooked the little grey cells of Hercule Poirot.\u201d\nPoirot has his virtues but modesty is not one of them.",
    "Twelve\nTHE BAITED TRAP\n\nIt was midJanuary\u2014a typical English winter day in London damp and dirty.",

    "\u201cA penny for your thoughts\u201d I said lightly.",
    "\u201cI was thinking my friend that at midsummer when you first arrived you told me that\nyou proposed to be in this country for a couple of months only.\u201d\n\u201cDid I say that\u201d I asked rather awkwardly.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s smile broadened.",
    "\u201cYou did mon ami.",
    "Since then you have changed your plan is it not so\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2014yes I have.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that\u201d\n\u201cDash it all Poirot you don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to leave you all alone when you\u2019re up\nagainst a thing like the \u2018Big Four\u2019 do you\u201d\nPoirot nodded gently.",
    "\u201cJust as I thought.",
    "You are a staunch friend Hastings.",
    "It is to serve me that you remain\non here.",
    "And your wife\u2014little Cinderella as you call her what does she say\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gone into details of course but she understands.",
    "She\u2019d be the last one to\nwish me to turn my back on a pal.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes she too is a loyal friend.",
    "But it is going to be a long business perhaps.\u201d\nI nodded rather discouraged.",
    "\u201cSix months already\u201d I mused \u201cand where are we You know Poirot I can\u2019t help\nthinking that we ought to\u2014well to do something.\u201d\n\u201cAlways so energetic Hastings And what precisely would you have me do\u201d\nThis was somewhat of a poser but I was not going to withdraw from my position.",
    "\u201cWe ought to take the offensive\u201d I urged.",
    "\u201cWhat have we done all this time\u201d\n\u201cMore than you think my friend.",
    "After all we have established the identity of Number\nTwo and Number Three and we have learnt more than a little about the ways and methods\nof Number Four.\u201d\nI brightened up a little.",
    "As Poirot put it things didn\u2019t sound so bad.",
    "\u201cOh Yes Hastings we have done a great deal.",
    "It is true that I am not in a position to\n\n\faccuse either Ryland or Madame Olivier\u2014who would believe me You remember I thought\nonce I had Ryland successfully cornered Nevertheless I have made my suspicions known\nin certain quarters\u2014the highest\u2014Lord Aldington who enlisted my help in the matter of the\nstolen submarine plans is fully cognizant of all my information respecting the Big Four\u2014\nand while others may doubt he believes.",
    "Ryland and Madame Olivier and Li Chang Yen\nhimself may go their ways but there is a searchlight turned on all their movements.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Number Four\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cAs I said just now\u2014I am beginning to know and understand his methods.",
    "You may\nsmile Hastings\u2014but to penetrate a man\u2019s personality to know exactly what he will do\nunder any given circumstances\u2014that is the beginning of success.",
    "It is a duel between us and\nwhilst he is constantly giving away his mentality to me I endeavour to let him know little or\nnothing of mine.",
    "He is in the light I in the shade.",
    "I tell you Hastings that every day they fear\nme the more for my chosen inactivity.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve let us alone anyway\u201d I observed.",
    "\u201cThere have been no more attempts on\nyour life and no ambushes of any kind.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cOn the whole that rather surprises me.",
    "Especially as\nthere are one or two fairly obvious ways of getting at us which I should have thought certain\nto have occurred to them.",
    "You catch my meaning perhaps\u201d\n\u201cAn infernal machine of some kind\u201d I hazarded.",
    "Poirot made a sharp click with his tongue expressive of impatience.",
    "\u201cBut no I appeal to your imagination and you can suggest nothing more subtle than\nbombs in the fireplace.",
    "Well well I have need of some matches I will promenade myself\ndespite the weather.",
    "Pardon my friend but it is possible that you read The Future of the\nArgentine Mirror of Society Cattle Breeding The Clue of Crimson and Sport in the\nRockies at one and the same time\u201d\nI laughed and admitted that The Clue of Crimson was at present engaging my sole\nattention.",
    "Poirot shook his head sadly.",
    "\u201cBut replace then the others on the bookshelf Never never shall I see you embrace the\norder and the method.",
    "Mon Dieu what then is a bookshelf for\u201d\nI apologized humbly and Poirot after replacing the offending volumes each in its\nappointed place went out and left me to uninterrupted enjoyment of my selected book.",
    "I must admit however that I was half asleep when Mrs. Pearson\u2019s knock at the door\naroused me.",
    "\u201cA telegram for you captain.\u201d\nI tore the orange envelope open without much interest.",
    "Then I sat as though turned to stone.",
    "It was a cable from Bronsen my manager out at the South American ranch and it ran as\nfollows\nMrs. Hastings disappeared yesterday feared been kidnapped by some gang\n\n\fcalling itself big four cable instructions have notified police but no clue as yet\nBronsen.",
    "I waved Mrs. Pearson out of the room and sat as though stunned reading the words over\nand over again.",
    "Cinderella\u2014kidnapped In the hands of the imfamous Big Four God what\ncould I do\nPoirot I must have Poirot.",
    "He would advise me.",
    "He would checkmate them somehow.",
    "In a few minutes now he would be back.",
    "I must wait patiently until then.",
    "But Cinderella\u2014in\nthe hands of the Big Four\nAnother knock.",
    "Mrs. Pearson put her head in once more.",
    "\u201cA note for you captain\u2014brought by a heathen Chinaman.",
    "He\u2019s awaiting downstairs.\u201d\nI seized it from her.",
    "It was brief and to the point.",
    "\u201cIf you ever wish to see your wife again go with the bearer of this note immediately.",
    "Leave no message for your friend or she will suffer.\u201d\nIt was signed with a big 4.",
    "What ought I to have done What would you who read have done in my place\nI had no time to think.",
    "I saw only one thing\u2014Cinderella in the power of those devils.",
    "I\nmust obey\u2014I dare not risk a hair of her head.",
    "I must go with this Chinaman and follow\nwhither he led.",
    "It was a trap yes and it meant certain capture and possible death but it was\nbaited with the person dearest to me in the whole world and I dared not hesitate.",
    "What irked me most was to leave no word for Poirot.",
    "Once set him on my track and all\nmight yet be well Dare I risk it Apparently I was under no supervision but yet I hesitated.",
    "It would have been so easy for the Chinaman to come up and assure himself that I was\nkeeping to the letter of the command.",
    "Why didn\u2019t he His very abstention made me more\nsuspicious.",
    "I had seen so much of the omnipotence of the Big Four that I credited them with\nalmost superhuman powers.",
    "For all I know even the little bedraggled servant girl might be\none of their agents.",
    "No I dared not risk it.",
    "But one thing I could do leave the telegram.",
    "He would know\nthen that Cinderella had disappeared and who was responsible for her disappearance.",
    "All this passed through my head in less time than it takes to tell and I had clapped my\nhat on my head and was descending the stairs to where my guide waited in a little over a\nminute.",
    "The bearer of the message was a tall impassive Chinaman neatly but rather shabbily\ndressed.",
    "He bowed and spoke to me.",
    "His English was perfect but he spoke with a slight\nsingsong intonation.",
    "\u201cYou Captain Hastings\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cYou give me note please.\u201d\nI had foreseen the request and handed him over the scrap of paper without a word.",
    "But\n\n\fthat was not all.",
    "\u201cYou have a telegram today yes Come along just now From South America yes\u201d\nI realized anew the excellence of their espionage system\u2014or it might have been a\nshrewd guess.",
    "Bronsen was bound to cable me.",
    "They would wait until the cable was\ndelivered and would strike hard upon it.",
    "No good could come of denying what was palpably true.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI did get a telegram.\u201d\n\u201cYou fetch him yes Fetch him now.\u201d\nI ground my teeth but what could I do I ran upstairs again.",
    "As I did so I thought of\nconfiding in Mrs. Pearson at any rate as far as Cinderella\u2019s disappearance went.",
    "She was\non the landing but close behind her was the little maidservant and I hesitated.",
    "If she was a\nspy\u2014the words of the note danced before my eyes \u201c\u2026she will suffer \u2026\u201d I passed into the\nsitting room without speaking.",
    "I took up the telegram and was about to pass out again when an idea struck me.",
    "Could I\nnot leave some sign which would mean nothing to my enemies but which Poirot himself\nwould find significant.",
    "I hurried across to the bookcase and tumbled out four books on to the\nfloor.",
    "No fear of Poirot\u2019s not seeing them.",
    "They would outrage his eyes immediately\u2014and\ncoming on top of his little lecture surely he would find them unusual.",
    "Next I put a shovelful\nof coal on the fire and managed to spill four knobs into the grate.",
    "I had done all I could\u2014\npray Heaven Poirot would read the sign aright.",
    "I hurried down again.",
    "The Chinaman took the telegram from me read it then placed it\nin his pocket and with a nod beckoned me to follow him.",
    "It was a long weary march that he led me.",
    "Once we took a bus and once we went for\nsome considerable way in a tram and always our route led us steadily eastward.",
    "We went\nthrough strange districts whose existence I had never dreamed of.",
    "We were down by the\ndocks now I knew and I realized that I was being taken into the heart of Chinatown.",
    "In spite of myself I shivered.",
    "Still my guide plodded on turning and twisting through\nmean streets and byways until at last he stopped at a dilapidated house and rapped four\ntimes upon the door.",
    "It was opened immediately by another Chinaman who stood aside to let us pass in.",
    "The\nclanging to of the door behind me was the knell of my last hopes.",
    "I was indeed in the hands\nof the enemy.",
    "I was now handed over to the second Chinaman.",
    "He led me down some rickety stairs\nand into a cellar which was filled with bales and casks and which exhaled a pungent odour\nas of eastern spices.",
    "I felt wrapped all round with the atmosphere of the East tortuous\ncunning sinister\u2014\nSuddenly my guide rolled aside two of the casks and I saw a low tunnellike opening in\nthe wall.",
    "He motioned me to go ahead.",
    "The tunnel was of some length and it was too low\nfor me to stand upright.",
    "At last however it broadened out into a passage and a few minutes\nlater we stood in another cellar.",
    "My Chinaman went forward and rapped four times on one of the walls.",
    "A whole\nsection of the wall swung out leaving a narrow doorway.",
    "I passed through and to my utter\nastonishment found myself in a kind of Arabian Nights\u2019 palace.",
    "A low long subterranean\nchamber hung with rich oriental silks brilliantly lighted and fragrant with perfumes and\nspices.",
    "There were five or six silkcovered divans and exquisite carpets of Chinese\nworkmanship covered the ground.",
    "At the end of the room was a curtained recess.",
    "From\nbehind these curtains came a voice.",
    "\u201cYou have brought our honoured guest\u201d\n\u201cExcellency he is here\u201d replied my guide.",
    "\u201cLet our guest enter\u201d was the answer.",
    "At the same moment the curtains were drawn aside by an unseen hand and I was facing\nan immense cushioned divan on which sat a tall thin Oriental dressed in wonderfully\nembroidered robes and clearly by the length of his finger nails a great man.",
    "\u201cBe seated I pray you Captain Hastings\u201d he said with a wave of his hand.",
    "\u201cYou\nacceded to my request to come immediately I am glad to see.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cLi Chang Yen\u201d\n\u201cIndeed no I am but the humblest of the master\u2019s servants.",
    "I carry out his behests that\nis all\u2014as do other of his servants in other countries\u2014in South America for instance.\u201d\nI advanced a step.",
    "\u201cWhere is she What have you done with her out there\u201d\n\u201cShe is in a place of safety\u2014where none will find her.",
    "As yet she is unharmed.",
    "You\nobserve that I say\u2014as yet\u201d\nCold shivers ran down my spine as I confronted this smiling devil.",
    "\u201cWhat do you want\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cMoney\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Captain Hastings.",
    "We have no designs on your small savings I can assure\nyou.",
    "Not\u2014pardon me\u2014a very intelligent suggestion on your part.",
    "Your colleague would not\nhave made it I fancy.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose\u201d I said heavily \u201cyou wanted to get me into your toils.",
    "Well you have\nsucceeded.",
    "I have come here with my eyes open.",
    "Do what you like with me and let her go.",
    "She knows nothing and she can be no possible use to you.",
    "You\u2019ve used her to get hold of\nme\u2014you\u2019ve got me all right and that settles it.\u201d\nThe smiling Oriental caressed his smooth cheek watching me obliquely out of his\nnarrow eyes.",
    "\u201cYou go too fast\u201d he said purringly.",
    "\u201cThat does not quite\u2014settle it.",
    "In fact to \u2018get hold\nof you\u2019 as you express it is not really our objective.",
    "But through you we hope to get hold of\nyour friend M. Hercule Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t do that\u201d I said with a short laugh.",

    "Me I was prepared.",
    "Not so\nlong ago I rendered a service to a very famous chemist who did a lot of work in connection\nwith poison gas during the war.",
    "He devised for me a little bomb\u2014simple and easy to carry\nabout\u2014one has but to throw it and poof the smoke\u2014and then the unconsciousness.",
    "Immediately I blow a little whistle and straightway some of Japp\u2019s clever fellows who\nwere watching the house here long before the boy arrived and who managed to follow us\nall the way to Limehouse came flying up and took charge of the situation.\u201d\n\u201cBut how was it you weren\u2019t unconscious too\u201d\n\u201cAnother piece of luck.",
    "Our friend Number Four who certainly composed that\ningenious letter permitted himself a little jest at my moustaches which rendered it\nextremely easy for me to adjust my respirator under the guise of a yellow muffler.\u201d\n\u201cI remember\u201d I cried eagerly and then with the word \u201cremember\u201d all the ghastly\nhorror that I had temporarily forgotten came back to me.",
    "Cinderella\u2014\nI fell back with a groan.",

    "And by the time we get\nthere\u2014long before she will be dead\u2014and God knows how and in what horrible way she\n\n\fwill have died.\u201d\n\u201cNo no you do not understand.",
    "She is safe and well.",
    "She has never been in their hands\nfor one instant.\u201d\n\u201cBut I got a cable from Bronsen\u201d\n\u201cNo no you did not.",
    "You may have got a cable from South America signed Bronsen\u2014\nthat is a very different matter.",
    "Tell me has it never occurred to you that an organization of\nthis kind with ramifications all over the world might easily strike at us through the little\ngirl Cinderella whom you love so well\u201d\n\u201cNo never\u201d I replied.",
    "\u201cWell it did to me.",
    "I said nothing to you because I did not want to upset you\nunnecessarily\u2014but I took measures of my own.",
    "Your wife\u2019s letters all seem to have been\nwritten from the ranch but in reality she has been in a place of safety devised by me for\nover three months.\u201d\nI looked at him for a long time.",

    "To begin with the leader of the gang had escaped.",
    "When Japp\u2019s men rushed up\nin response to Poirot\u2019s whistle they found four Chinamen unconscious in the hall but the\nman who had threatened me with death was not among them.",
    "I remembered afterwards that\nwhen I was forced out on to the doorstep to decoy Poirot into the house this man had kept\nwell in the background.",
    "Presumably he was out of the danger zone of the gas bomb and\nmade good his escape by one of the many exits which we afterwards discovered.",
    "From the four who remained in our hands we learnt nothing.",
    "The fullest investigation by\nthe police failed to bring to light anything to connect them with the Big Four.",
    "They were\nordinary lowclass residents of the district and they professed bland ignorance of the name\nLi Chang Yen.",
    "A Chinese gentleman had hired them for service in the house by the\nwaterside and they knew nothing whatever of his private affairs.",
    "By the next day I had except for a slight headache completely recovered from the\neffects of Poirot\u2019s gas bomb.",
    "We went down together to Chinatown and searched the house\nfrom which I had been rescued.",
    "The premises consisted of two ramshackle houses joined\ntogether by an underground passage.",
    "The ground floors and the upper stories of each were\nunfurnished and deserted the broken windows covered by decaying shutters.",
    "Japp had\nalready been prying about in the cellars and had discovered the secret of the entrance to the\nsubterranean chamber where I had spent such an unpleasant half hour.",
    "Closer investigation\nconfirmed the impression that it had made on me the night before.",
    "The silks on the walls and\ndivan and the carpets on the floor were of exquisite workmanship.",
    "Although I know very\nlittle about Chinese art I could appreciate that every article in the room was perfect of its\nkind.",
    "With the aid of Japp and some of his men we conducted a most thorough search of the\napartment.",
    "I had cherished high hopes that we would find documents of importance.",
    "A list\nperhaps of some of the more important agents of the Big Four or cipher notes of some of\ntheir plans but we discovered nothing of the kind.",
    "The only papers we found in the whole\nplace were the notes which the Chinaman had consulted whilst he was dictating the letter to\nPoirot.",
    "These consisted of a very complete record of each of our careers an estimate of our\ncharacters and suggestions about the weaknesses through which we might best be attacked.",
    "Poirot was most childishly delighted with this discovery.",
    "Personally I could not see\nthat it was of any value whatever especially as whoever compiled the notes was\nludicrously mistaken in some of his opinions.",
    "I pointed this out to my friend when we were\nback in our rooms.",
    "\u201cMy dear Poirot\u201d I said \u201cyou know now what the enemy thinks of us.",
    "He appears to\nhave a grossly exaggerated idea of your brain power and to have absurdly underrated mine\n\n\fbut I do not see how we are better off for knowing this.\u201d\nPoirot chuckled in rather an offensive way.",
    "\u201cYou do not see Hastings no But surely now we can prepare ourselves for some of\ntheir methods of attack now that we are warned of some of our faults.",
    "For instance my\nfriend we know that you should think before you act.",
    "Again if you meet a redhaired young\nwoman in trouble you should eye her\u2014what you say\u2014askance is it not\u201d\nTheir notes had contained some absurd references to my supposed impulsiveness and\nhad suggested that I was susceptible to the charms of young women with hair of a certain\nshade.",
    "I thought Poirot\u2019s reference to be in the worst of taste but fortunately I was able to\ncounter him.",
    "\u201cAnd what about you\u201d I demanded.",
    "\u201cAre you going to try to cure your \u2018overweening\nvanity\u2019 Your \u2018finicky tidiness\u2019\u201d\nI was quoting and I could see that he was not pleased with my retort.",
    "\u201cOh without doubt Hastings in some things they deceive themselves\u2014tant mieux\nThey will learn in due time.",
    "Meanwhile we have learnt something and to know is to be\nprepared.\u201d\nThis last was a favourite axiom of his lately so much so that I had begun to hate the\nsound of it.",
    "\u201cWe know something Hastings\u201d he continued.",
    "\u201cYes we know something\u2014and that is\nto the good\u2014but we do not know nearly enough.",
    "We must know more.\u201d\n\u201cIn what way\u201d\nPoirot settled himself back in his chair straightened a box of matches which I had\nthrown carelessly down on the table and assumed an attitude that I knew only too well.",
    "I\nsaw that he was prepared to hold forth at some length.",
    "\u201cSee you Hastings we have to contend against four adversaries that is against four\ndifferent personalities.",
    "With Number One we have never come into personal contact\u2014we\nknow him as it were only by the impress of his mind\u2014and in passing Hastings I will tell\nyou that I begin to understand that mind very well\u2014a mind most subtle and Oriental\u2014every\nscheme and plot that we have encountered has emanated from the brain of Li Chang Yen.",
    "Number Two and Number Three are so powerful so high up that they are for the present\nimmune from our attacks.",
    "Nevertheless what is their safeguard is by a perverse chance our\nsafeguard also.",
    "They are so much in the limelight that their movements must be carefully\nordered.",
    "And so we come to the last member of the gang\u2014we come to the man known as\nNumber Four.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s voice altered a little as it always did when speaking of this particular\nindividual.",
    "\u201cNumber Two and Number Three are able to succeed to go on their way unscathed\nowing to their notoriety and their assured position.",
    "Number Four succeeds for the opposite\nreason\u2014he succeeds by the way of obscurity.",
    "Who is he Nobody knows.",
    "What does he\nlook like Again nobody knows.",
    "How many times have we seen him you and I Five times\n\n\fis it not And could either of us say truthfully that we could be sure of recognizing him\nagain\u201d\nI was forced to shake my head as I ran back in my mind over those five different\npeople who incredible as it seemed were one and the same man.",
    "The burly lunatic asylum\nkeeper the man in the buttonedup overcoat in Paris James the footman the quiet young\nmedical man in the Yellow Jasmine case and the Russian professor.",
    "In no way did any two\nof these people resemble each other.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d I said hopelessly.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve nothing to go by whatsoever.\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cDo not I pray of you give way to such enthusiastic despair.",
    "We know one or two\nthings.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of things\u201d I asked sceptically.",
    "\u201cWe know that he is a man of medium height and of medium or fair colouring.",
    "If he\nwere a tall man of swarthy complexion he could never have passed himself off as the fair\nstocky doctor.",
    "It is child\u2019s play of course to put on an additional inch or so for the part of\nJames or the Professor.",
    "In the same way he must have a short straight nose.",
    "Additions can\nbe built on to a nose by skilful makeup but a large nose cannot be successfully reduced at a\nmoment\u2019s notice.",

    "You knew him very well did you not mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you Mr. Poirot.",
    "You\u2019re a gentleman.",

    "Downright mean I call it.",
    "As I was saying you being a Frenchman won\u2019t be shocked.",
    "Ah\nyou Frenchmen Naughty naughty\u201d She wagged her finger at him in an excess of archness.",

    "Though mind you he didn\u2019t treat me well\u2014no he didn\u2019t\n\u2014he didn\u2019t treat me well at all.",
    "Not as a lady should be treated.",
    "They\u2019re all the same when\nit comes to a question of money.\u201d\n\u201cNo no mademoiselle do not say that\u201d protested Poirot filling up her glass once\n\n\fmore.",
    "\u201cCould you now describe this Mr. Darrell to me\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t anything so very much to look at\u201d said Flossie Monro dreamily.",
    "\u201cNeither\ntall nor short you know but quite well set up.",
    "Spruce looking.",
    "Eyes a sort of bluegrey.",
    "And\nmore or less fairhaired I suppose.",
    "But oh what an artist I never saw anyone to touch him\nin the profession He\u2019d have made his name before now if it hadn\u2019t been for jealousy.",
    "Ah\nMr. Poirot jealousy\u2014you wouldn\u2019t believe it you really wouldn\u2019t what we artists have to\nsuffer through jealousy.",
    "Why I remember once at Manchester\u2014\u201d\nWe displayed what patience we could in listening to a long complicated story about a\npantomime and the infamous conduct of the principal boy.",
    "Then Poirot led her gently back\nto the subject of Claud Darrell.",
    "\u201cIt is very interesting all this that you are able to tell us mademoiselle about Mr.\nDarrell.",
    "Women are such wonderful observers\u2014they see everything they notice the little\ndetail that escapes the mere man.",
    "I have seen a woman identify one man out of a dozen\nothers\u2014and why do you think She had observed that he had a trick of stroking his nose\nwhen he was agitated.",
    "Now would a man ever have thought of noticing a thing like that\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever\u201d cried Miss Monro.",
    "\u201cI suppose we do notice things.",
    "I remember\nClaudie now I come to think of it always fiddling with his bread at table.",
    "He\u2019d get a little\npiece between his fingers and then dab it round to pick up crumbs.",
    "I\u2019ve seen him do it a\nhundred times.",
    "Why I\u2019d know him anywhere by that one trick of his.\u201d\n\u201cIs not that just what I say The marvellous observation of a woman.",
    "And did you ever\nspeak to him about this little habit of his mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t Mr. Poirot.",
    "You know what men are They don\u2019t like you to notice things\n\u2014especially if it should seem you were telling them off about it.",
    "I never said a word\u2014but\nmany\u2019s the time I smiled to myself.",
    "Bless you he never knew he was doing it even.\u201d\nPoirot nodded gently.",
    "I noticed that his own hand was shaking a little as he stretched it\nout to his glass.",
    "\u201cThen there is always handwriting as a means of establishing identity\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cWithout doubt you have preserved a letter written by Mr. Darrell\u201d\nFlossie Monro shook her head regretfully.",
    "\u201cHe was never one for writing.",
    "Never wrote me a line in his life.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a pity\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI tell you what though\u201d said Miss Monro suddenly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got a photograph if that\nwould be any good\u201d\n\u201cYou have a photograph\u201d\nPoirot almost sprang from his seat with excitement.",

    "\u201cWell I must run away\u201d she declared archly.",
    "\u201cVery glad to have met you and your\nfriend Mr. Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the photograph When may I have it\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll look it out tonight.",
    "I think I know where to lay my hands upon it.",
    "And I\u2019ll send it to\nyou right away.\u201d\n\u201cA thousand thanks mademoiselle.",
    "You are all that is of the most amiable.",
    "I hope that\nwe shall soon be able to arrange another little lunch together.\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as you like\u201d said Miss Monro.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m willing.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see I do not think that I have your address\u201d\nWith a grand air Miss Monro drew a card from her handbag and handed it to him.",
    "It\nwas a somewhat dirty card and the original address had been scratched out and another\nsubstituted in pencil.",
    "Then with a good many bows and gesticulations on Poirot\u2019s part we bade farewell to\nthe lady and got away.",
    "\u201cDo you really think this photograph so important\u201d I asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cYes mon ami.",
    "The camera does not lie.",
    "One can magnify a photograph seize salient\npoints that otherwise would remain unnoticed.",
    "And then there are a thousand details\u2014such\nas the structure of the ears which no one could ever describe to you in words.",
    "Oh yes it is\na great chance this which has come our way That is why I propose to take precautions.\u201d\nHe went across to the telephone as he finished speaking and gave a number which I\nknew to be that of a private detective agency which he sometimes employed.",
    "His\ninstructions were clear and definite.",
    "Two men were to go to the address he gave and in\ngeneral terms were to watch over the safety of Miss Monro.",
    "They were to follow her\nwherever she went.",
    "Poirot hung up the receiver and came back to me.",
    "\u201cDo you really think that necessary Poirot\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cIt may be.",
    "There is no doubt that we are watched you and I and since that is so they\nwill soon know with whom we were lunching today.",
    "And it is possible that Number Four\nwill scent danger.\u201d\nAbout twenty minutes later the telephone bell rang.",
    "I answered it.",
    "A curt voice spoke\ninto the phone.",
    "\u201cIs that Mr. Poirot St. James\u2019s Hospital speaking.",
    "A young woman was brought in ten\nminutes ago.",
    "Street accident.",
    "Miss Flossie Monro.",
    "She is asking very urgently for Mr.\n\n\fPoirot.",
    "But he must come at once.",
    "She can\u2019t possibly last long.\u201d\nI repeated the words to Poirot.",
    "His face went white.",
    "\u201cQuick Hastings.",
    "We must go like the wind.\u201d\nA taxi took us to the hospital in less than ten minutes.",
    "We asked for Miss Monro and\nwere taken immediately to the Accident Ward.",
    "But a whitecapped sister met us in the\ndoorway.",
    "Poirot read the news in her face.",
    "\u201cIt is over eh\u201d\n\u201cShe died six minutes ago.\u201d\nPoirot stood as though stunned.",
    "The nurse mistaking his emotion began speaking gently.",
    "\u201cShe did not suffer and she was unconscious towards the last.",
    "She was run over by a\nmotor you know\u2014and the driver of the car did not even stop.",
    "Wicked isn\u2019t it I hope\nsomeone took the number.\u201d\n\u201cThe stars fight against us\u201d said Poirot in a low voice.",
    "\u201cYou would like to see her\u201d\nThe nurse led the way and we followed.",
    "Poor Flossie Monro with her rouge and her dyed hair.",
    "She lay there very peacefully\nwith a little smile on her lips.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe stars fight against us\u2014but is it the stars\u201d He lifted his\nhead as though struck by a sudden idea.",
    "\u201cIs it the stars Hastings If it is not\u2014if it is not \u2026\nOh I swear to you my friend standing here by this poor woman\u2019s body that I will have no\nmercy when the time comes\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d I asked.",
    "But Poirot had turned to the nurse and was eagerly demanding information.",
    "A list of the\narticles found in her handbag was finally obtained.",
    "Poirot gave a suppressed cry as he read\nit over.",
    "\u201cYou see Hastings you see\u201d\n\u201cSee what\u201d\n\u201cThere is no mention of a latchkey.",
    "But she must have had a latchkey with her.",
    "No she\nwas run down in cold blood and the first person who bent over her took the key from her\nbag.",
    "But we may yet be in time.",
    "He may not have been able to find at once what he sought.\u201d\nAnother taxi took us to the address Flossie Monro had given us a squalid block of\nMansions in an unsavoury neighbourhood.",
    "It was some time before we could gain admission\nto Miss Monro\u2019s flat but we had at least the satisfaction of knowing that no one could leave\nit whilst we were on guard outside.",
    "Eventually we got in.",
    "It was plain that someone had been before us.",
    "The contents of\ndrawers and cupboards were strewn all over the floor.",
    "Locks had been forced and small\ntables had even been overthrown so violent had been the searcher\u2019s haste.",
    "Poirot began to hunt through the d\u00e9bris.",
    "Suddenly he stood erect with a cry holding out\nsomething.",
    "It was an oldfashioned photograph frame\u2014empty.",
    "He turned it slowly over.",
    "Affixed to the back was a small round label\u2014a price label.",
    "\u201cIt cost four shillings\u201d I commented.",
    "\u201cMon Dieu Hastings use your eyes.",
    "That is a new clean label.",
    "It was stuck there by\nthe man who took out the photograph the man who was here before us but knew that we\nshould come and so left this for us\u2014Claud Darrell\u2014alias Number Four.\u201d\n\n\fFifteen\nTHE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE\n\nIt was after the tragic death of Miss Flossie Monro that I began to be aware of a change in\nPoirot.",
    "Up to now his invincible confidence in himself had stood the test.",
    "But it seemed as\nthough at last the long strain was beginning to tell.",
    "His manner was grave and brooding\nand his nerves were on edge.",
    "In these days he was as jumpy as a cat.",
    "He avoided all\ndiscussion of the Big Four as far as possible and seemed to throw himself into his ordinary\nwork with almost his old ardour.",
    "Nevertheless I knew that he was secretly active in the big\nmatter.",
    "Extraordinarylooking Slavs were constantly calling to see him and though he\nvouchsafed no explanation as to these mysterious activities I realized that he was building\nsome new defence or weapon of opposition with the help of these somewhat repulsivelooking foreigners.",
    "Once purely by chance I happened to see the entries in his passbook\u2014\nhe had asked me to verify some small item\u2014and I noticed the paying out of a huge sum\u2014a\nhuge sum even for Poirot who was coining money nowadays\u2014to some Russian with\napparently every letter of the alphabet in his name.",
    "But he gave no clue as to the line on which he proposed to operate.",
    "Only over and over\nagain he gave utterance to one phrase.",
    "\u201cIt is a mistake to underestimate your adversary.",
    "Remember that mon ami.\u201d And I realized that that was the pitfall he was striving at all\ncosts to avoid.",
    "So matters went on until the end of March and then one morning Poirot made a remark\nwhich startled me considerably.",
    "\u201cThis morning my friend I should recommend the best suit.",
    "We go to call upon the\nHome Secretary.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed That is very exciting.",
    "He has called you in to take up a case\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly.",
    "The interview is of my seeking.",
    "You may remember my saying that I once\ndid him some small service He is inclined to be foolishly enthusiastic over my capabilities\nin consequence and I am about to trade on this attitude of his.",
    "As you know the French\nPremier M. Desjardeaux is over in London and at my request the Home Secretary has\narranged for him to be present at our little conference this morning.\u201d\nThe Right Honourable Sydney Crowther His Majesty\u2019s Secretary of State for Home\nAffairs was a wellknown and popular figure.",
    "A man of some fifty years of age with a\nquizzical expression and shrewd grey eyes he received us with that delightful bonhomie of\nmanner which was wellknown to be one of his principal assets.",
    "Standing with his back to the fireplace was a tall thin man with a pointed black beard\nand a sensitive face.",

    "\u201cWho has not\u201d\n\u201cYou are too amiable monsieur\u201d said Poirot bowing but his face flushed with\npleasure.",

    "It was our old acquaintance Mr. Ingles.",
    "Poirot shook him warmly by the hand.",
    "\u201cAnd now M. Poirot\u201d said Crowther.",
    "\u201cWe are at your service.",
    "I understand you to say\nthat you had a communication of the utmost importance to make to us.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so monsieur.",
    "There is in the world today a vast organization\u2014an organization\nof crime.",
    "It is controlled by four individuals who are known and spoken of as the Big Four.",
    "Number One is a Chinaman Li Chang Yen Number Two is the American multimillionaire\nAbe Ryland Number Three is a Frenchwoman Number Four I have every reason to believe\nis an obscure English actor called Claud Darrell.",
    "These four are banded together to destroy\nthe existing social order and to replace it with an anarchy in which they would reign as\ndictators.\u201d\n\u201cIncredible\u201d muttered the Frenchman.",
    "\u201cRyland mixed up with a thing of that kind\nSurely the idea is too fantastic.\u201d\n\u201cListen monsieur whilst I recount to you some of the doings of this Big Four.\u201d\nIt was an enthralling narrative which Poirot unfolded.",
    "Familiar as I was with all the\ndetails they thrilled me anew as I heard the bald recital of our adventures and escapes.",
    "M. Desjardeaux looked mutely at Mr. Crowther as Poirot finished.",
    "The other answered\nthe look.",
    "\u201cYes M. Desjardeaux I think we must admit the existence of a \u2018Big Four.\u2019 Scotland\nYard was inclined to jeer at first but they have been forced to admit that M. Poirot was\nright in many of his claims.",
    "I cannot but feel that M. Poirot\u2014er\u2014exaggerates a little.\u201d\nFor answer Poirot set forth ten salient points.",
    "I have been asked not to give them to the\npublic even now and so I refrain from doing so but they included the extraordinary\ndisasters to submarines which occurred in a certain month and also a series of aeroplane\naccidents and forced landings.",
    "According to Poirot these were all the work of the Big Four\nand bore witness to the fact that they were in possession of various scientific secrets\nunknown to the world at large.",
    "This brought us straight to the question which I had been waiting for the French premier\nto ask.",
    "\u201cYou say that the third member of this organization is a Frenchwoman.",
    "Have you any\nidea of her name\u201d\n\u201cIt is a wellknown name monsieur.",
    "An honoured name.",
    "Number Three is no less than\nthe famous Madame Olivier.\u201d\n\n\fAt the mention of the worldfamous scientist successor to the Curies M. Desjardeaux\npositively bounded from his chair his face purple with emotion.",
    "\u201cMadame Olivier Impossible Absurd It is an insult what you say there\u201d\nPoirot shook his head gently but made no answer.",
    "Desjardeaux looked at him in stupefaction for some moments.",

    "\u201cBut even the great man\u2014sometimes he has\nhis little mania does he not And seeks in high places for fancied conspiracies.",
    "It is wellknown.",
    "You agree with me do you not Mr. Crowther\u201d\nThe Home Secretary did not answer for some minutes.",
    "Then he spoke slowly and\nheavily.",
    "\u201cUpon my soul I don\u2019t know\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cI have always had and still have the\nutmost belief in M. Poirot but\u2014well this takes a bit of believing.\u201d\n\u201cThis Li Chang Yen too\u201d continued M. Desjardeaux.",
    "\u201cWho has ever heard of him\u201d\n\u201cI have\u201d said the unexpected voice of Mr. Ingles.",

    "\u201cMr.",
    "Ingles\u201d explained the Home Secretary \u201cis the greatest\nauthority we have on the interior of China.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have heard of this Li Chang Yen\u201d\n\u201cUntil M. Poirot here came to me I imagined that I was the only man in England who\nhad.",

    "He has perhaps I only say perhaps the finest brain in the world at the\npresent time.\u201d\nM. Desjardeaux sat as though stunned.",
    "Presently however he rallied.",
    "\u201cThere may be something in what you say M. Poirot\u201d he said coldly.",
    "\u201cBut as regards\nMadame Olivier you are most certainly mistaken.",
    "She is a true daughter of France and\ndevoted solely to the cause of science.\u201d\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.",
    "There was a minute or two\u2019s pause and then my little friend rose to his feet with an air\nof dignity that sat rather oddly upon his quaint personality.",
    "\u201cThat is all I have to say messieurs\u2014to warn you.",
    "I thought it likely that I should not be\nbelieved.",
    "But at least you will be on your guard.",
    "My words will sink in and each fresh\nevent that comes along will confirm your wavering faith.",
    "It was necessary for me to speak\nnow\u2014later I might not have been able to do so.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d asked Crowther impressed in spite of himself by the gravity of\nPoirot\u2019s tone.",
    "\u201cI mean monsieur that since I have penetrated the identity of Number Four my life is\nnot worth an hour\u2019s purchase.",
    "He will seek to destroy me at all costs\u2014and not for nothing is\n\n\fhe named \u2018The Destroyer.\u2019 Messieurs I salute you.",
    "To you M. Crowther I deliver this key\nand this sealed envelope.",
    "I have got together all my notes on the case and my ideas as to\nhow best to meet the menace that any day may break upon the world and have placed them\nin a certain safe deposit.",
    "In the event of my death M. Crowther I authorize you to take\ncharge of those papers and make what use you can of them.",
    "And now messieurs I wish you\ngood day.\u201d\nDesjardeaux merely bowed coldly but Crowther sprang up and held out his hand.",
    "\u201cYou have converted me M. Poirot.",
    "Fantastic as the whole thing seems I believe\nutterly in the truth of what you have told us.\u201d\nIngles left at the same time as we did.",
    "\u201cI am not disappointed with the interview\u201d said Poirot as we walked along.",
    "\u201cI did not\nexpect to convince Desjardeaux but I have at least ensured that if I die my knowledge does\nnot die with me.",
    "And I have made one or two converts.",
    "Pas si mal\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m with you as you know\u201d said Ingles.",
    "\u201cBy the way I\u2019m going out to China as soon\nas I can get off.\u201d\n\u201cIs that wise\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Ingles drily.",
    "\u201cBut it\u2019s necessary.",
    "One must do what one can.\u201d\n\u201cAh you are a brave man\u201d cried Poirot with emotion.",
    "\u201cIf we were not in the street I\nwould embrace you.\u201d\nI fancied that Ingles looked rather relieved.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose that I shall be in any more danger in China than you are in London\u201d he\ngrowled.",
    "\u201cThat is possibly true enough\u201d admitted Poirot.",
    "\u201cI hope that they will not succeed in\nmassacring Hastings also that is all.",
    "That would annoy me greatly.\u201d\nI interrupted this cheerful conversation to remark that I had no intention of letting myself\nbe massacred and shortly afterwards Ingles parted from us.",
    "For some time we went along in silence which Poirot at length broke by uttering a\ntotally unexpected remark.",
    "\u201cI think\u2014I really think\u2014that I shall have to bring my brother into this.\u201d\n\u201cYour brother\u201d I cried astonished.",
    "\u201cI never knew you had a brother\u201d\n\u201cYou surprise me Hastings.",
    "Do you not know that all celebrated detectives have\nbrothers who would be even more celebrated than they are were it not for constitutional\nindolence\u201d\nPoirot employs a peculiar manner sometimes which makes it wellnigh impossible to\nknow whether he is jesting or in earnest.",
    "That manner was very evident at the moment.",
    "\u201cWhat is your brother\u2019s name\u201d I asked trying to adjust myself to this new idea.",
    "\u201cAchille Poirot\u201d replied Poirot gravely.",
    "\u201cHe lives near Spa in Belgium.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat does he do\u201d I asked with some curiosity putting aside a halfformed wonder as\nto the character and disposition of the late Madame Poirot and her classical taste in\nChristian names.",
    "\u201cHe does nothing.",
    "He is as I tell of a singularly indolent disposition.",
    "But his abilities\nare hardly less than my own\u2014which is saying a great deal.\u201d\n\u201cIs he like you to look at\u201d\n\u201cNot unlike.",
    "But not nearly so handsome.",
    "And he wears no moustaches.\u201d\n\u201cIs he older than you or younger\u201d\n\u201cHe happens to have been born on the same day.\u201d\n\u201cA twin\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cExactly Hastings.",
    "You jump to the right conclusion with unfailing accuracy.",
    "But here\nwe are at home again.",
    "Let us at once get to work on that little affair of the Duchess\u2019s\nnecklace.\u201d\nBut the Duchess\u2019s necklace was doomed to wait awhile.",
    "A case of quite another\ndescription was waiting for us.",
    "Our landlady Mrs. Pearson at once informed us that a hospital nurse had called and\nwas waiting to see Poirot.",
    "We found her sitting in the big armchair facing the window a pleasantfaced woman of\nmiddle age in a dark blue uniform.",
    "She was a little reluctant to come to the point but Poirot\nsoon put her at her ease and she embarked upon her story.",
    "\u201cYou see M. Poirot I\u2019ve never come across anything of the kind before.",
    "I was sent for\nfrom the Lark Sisterhood to go down to a case in Hertfordshire.",
    "An old gentleman it is Mr.\nTempleton.",
    "Quite a pleasant house and quite pleasant people.",
    "The wife Mrs. Templeton is\nmuch younger than the husband and he has a son by his first marriage who lives there.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t know that the young man and the stepmother always get on together.",
    "He\u2019s not quite\nwhat you\u2019d call normal\u2014not \u2018wanting\u2019 exactly but decidedly dull in the intellect.",
    "Well this\nillness of Mr. Templeton\u2019s seemed to me from the first to be mysterious.",
    "At times there\nseemed really nothing the matter with him and then he suddenly has one of these gastric\nattacks with pain and vomiting.",
    "But the doctor seemed quite satisfied and it wasn\u2019t for me\nto say anything.",
    "But I couldn\u2019t help thinking about it.",
    "And then\u2014\u201d She paused and became\nrather red.",
    "\u201cSomething happened which aroused your suspicions\u201d suggested Poirot.",
    "\u201cYes.\u201d\nBut she still seemed to find it difficult to go on.",
    "\u201cI found the servants were passing remarks too.\u201d\n\u201cAbout Mr. Templeton\u2019s illness\u201d\n\u201cOh no About\u2014about this other thing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Templeton\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Templeton and the doctor perhaps\u201d\nPoirot had an uncanny flair in these things.",
    "The nurse threw him a grateful glance and\nwent on.",
    "\u201cThey were passing remarks.",
    "And then one day I happened to see them together myself\n\u2014in the garden\u2014\u201d\nIt was left at that.",
    "Our client was in such an agony of outraged propriety that no one\ncould feel it necessary to ask exactly what she had seen in the garden.",
    "She had evidently\nseen quite enough to make up her own mind on the situation.",
    "\u201cThe attacks got worse and worse.",
    "Dr. Treves said it was all perfectly natural and to\nbe expected and that Mr. Templeton could not possibly live long but I\u2019ve never seen\nanything like it before myself\u2014not in all my long experience of nursing.",
    "It seemed to me\nmuch more like some form of\u2014\u201d\nShe paused hesitating.",
    "\u201cArsenical poisoning\u201d said Poirot helpfully.",
    "She nodded.",
    "\u201cAnd then too he the patient I mean said something queer.",
    "\u2018They\u2019ll do for me the\nfour of them.",
    "They\u2019ll do for me yet.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cEh\u201d said Poirot quickly.",
    "\u201cThose were his very words M. Poirot.",
    "He was in great pain at the time of course and\nhardly knew what he was saying.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019ll do for me the four of them\u2019\u201d repeated Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cWhat did he\nmean by \u2018the four of them\u2019 do you think\u201d\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t say M. Poirot.",
    "I thought perhaps he meant his wife and son and the\ndoctor and perhaps Miss Clark Mrs. Templeton\u2019s companion.",
    "That would make four\nwouldn\u2019t it He might think they were all in league against him.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so quite so\u201d said Poirot in a preoccupied voice.",
    "\u201cWhat about food Could you\ntake no precautions about that\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m always doing what I can.",
    "But of course sometimes Mrs. Templeton insists on\nbringing him his food herself and then there are the times when I am off duty.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "And you are not sure enough of your ground to go to the police\u201d\nThe nurse\u2019s face showed her horror at the mere idea.",
    "\u201cWhat I have done M. Poirot is this.",
    "Mr. Templeton had a very bad attack after\npartaking of a bowl of soup.",
    "I took a little from the bottom of the bowl afterwards and have\nbrought it up with me.",
    "I have been spared for the day to visit a sick mother as Mr.\nTempleton was well enough to be left.\u201d\nShe drew out a little bottle of dark fluid and handed it to Poirot.",
    "\u201cExcellent mademoiselle.",
    "We will have this analysed immediately.",
    "If you will return\nhere in say an hour\u2019s time I think that we shall be able to dispose of your suspicions one\nway or another.\u201d\nFirst extracting from our visitor her name and qualifications he ushered her out.",
    "Then\nhe wrote a note and sent it off together with the bottle of soup.",
    "Whilst we waited to hear the\nresult Poirot amused himself by verifying the nurse\u2019s credentials somewhat to my surprise.",
    "\u201cNo no my friend\u201d he declared.",
    "\u201cI do well to be careful.",
    "Do not forget the Big Four\nare on our track.\u201d\nHowever he soon elicited the information that a nurse of the name of Mabel Palmer\nwas a member of the Lark Institute and had been sent to the case in question.",
    "\u201cSo far so good\u201d he said with a twinkle.",
    "\u201cAnd now here comes Nurse Palmer back\nagain and here also is our analyst\u2019s report.",
    "\u201cIs there arsenic in it\u201d she asked breathlessly.",

    "\u201cNo.\u201d\nWe were both immeasurably surprised.",
    "\u201cThere is no arsenic in it\u201d continued Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut there is antimony and that being the\ncase we will start immediately for Hertfordshire.",
    "Pray Heaven that we are not too late.\u201d\nIt was decided that the simplest plan was for Poirot to represent himself truly as a\ndetective but that the ostensible reason of his visit should be to question Mrs. Templeton\nabout a servant formerly in her employment whose name he obtained from Nurse Palmer\nand whom he could represent as being concerned in a jewel robbery.",
    "It was late when we arrived at Elmstead as the house was called.",
    "We had allowed\nNurse Palmer to precede us by about twenty minutes so that there should be no question of\nour all arriving together.",
    "Mrs. Templeton a tall dark woman with sinuous movements and uneasy eyes received\nus.",
    "I noticed that as Poirot announced his profession she drew in her breath with a sudden\nhiss as though badly startled but she answered his question about the maidservant readily\nenough.",
    "And then to test her Poirot embarked upon a long history of a poisoning case in\nwhich a guilty wife had figured.",
    "His eyes never left her face as he talked and try as she\nwould she could hardly conceal her rising agitation.",
    "Suddenly with an incoherent word of\nexcuse she hurried from the room.",
    "We were not long left alone.",
    "A squarely built man with a small red moustache and\npincenez came in.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Treves\u201d he introduced himself.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Templeton asked me to make her excuses to\nyou.",
    "She\u2019s in a very bad state you know.",
    "Nervous strain.",
    "Worry over her husband and all\nthat.",
    "I\u2019ve prescribed bed and bromide.",
    "But she hopes you\u2019ll stay and take pot luck and I\u2019m\nto do host.",
    "We\u2019ve heard of you down here M. Poirot and we mean to make the most of you.",
    "Ah here\u2019s Micky\u201d\n\n\fA shambling young man entered the room.",
    "He had a very round face and foolishlooking eyebrows raised as though in perpetual surprise.",
    "He grinned awkwardly as he\nshook hands.",
    "This was clearly the \u201cwanting\u201d son.",
    "Presently we all went in to dinner.",
    "Dr. Treves left the room\u2014to open some wine I\nthink\u2014and suddenly the boy\u2019s physiognomy underwent a startling change.",
    "He leant forward\nstaring at Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve come about Father\u201d he said nodding his head.",
    "\u201cI know.",
    "I know lots of things\n\u2014but nobody thinks I do.",
    "Mother will be glad when Father\u2019s dead and she can marry Dr.\nTreves.",
    "She isn\u2019t my own mother you know.",
    "I don\u2019t like her.",
    "She wants Father to die.\u201d\nIt was all rather horrible.",
    "Luckily before Poirot had time to reply the doctor came\nback and we had to carry on a forced conversation.",
    "And then suddenly Poirot lay back in his chair with a hollow groan.",
    "His face was\ncontorted with pain.",
    "\u201cMy dear sir what\u2019s the matter\u201d cried the doctor.",
    "\u201cA sudden spasm.",
    "I am used to them.",
    "No no I require no assistance from you doctor.",
    "If I might lie down upstairs.\u201d\nHis request was instantly acceded to and I accompanied him upstairs where he\ncollapsed on the bed groaning heavily.",
    "For the first minute or two I had been taken in but I had quickly realized that Poirot\nwas\u2014as he would have put it\u2014playing the comedy and that his object was to be left alone\nupstairs near the patient\u2019s room.",
    "Hence I was quite prepared when the instant we were alone he sprang up.",
    "\u201cQuick Hastings the window.",
    "There is ivy outside.",
    "We can climb down before they\nbegin to suspect.\u201d\n\u201cClimb down\u201d\n\u201cYes we must get out of this house at once.",
    "You saw him at dinner\u201d\n\u201cThe doctor\u201d\n\u201cNo young Templeton.",
    "His trick with his bread.",
    "Do you remember what Flossie Monro\ntold us before she died That Claud Darrell had a habit of dabbing his bread on the table to\npick up crumbs.",
    "Hastings this is a vast plot and that vacantlooking young man is our\narchenemy\u2014Number Four Hurry.\u201d\nI did not wait to argue.",
    "Incredible as the whole thing seemed it was wiser not to delay.",
    "We scrambled down the ivy as quietly as we could and made a beeline for the small town\nand the railway station.",
    "We were just able to catch the last train the 834 which would land\nus in town about eleven o\u2019clock.",
    "\u201cA plot\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cHow many of them were in it I wonder I suspect\nthat the whole Templeton family are just so many agents of the Big Four.",
    "Did they simply\nwant to decoy us down there Or was it more subtle than that Did they intend to play the\ncomedy down there and keep me interested until they had had time to do\u2014what I wonder\n\n\fnow.\u201d\nHe remained very thoughtful.",
    "Arrived at our lodgings he restrained me at the door of the sitting room.",
    "\u201cAttention Hastings.",
    "I have my suspicions.",
    "Let me enter first.\u201d\nHe did so and to my slight amusement took the precaution to press on the electric\nswitch with an old galosh.",
    "Then he went round the room like a strange cat cautiously\ndelicately on the alert for danger.",
    "I watched him for some time remaining obediently where\nI had been put by the wall.",
    "\u201cIt seems all right Poirot\u201d I said impatiently.",
    "\u201cIt seems so mon ami it seems so.",
    "But let us make sure.\u201d\n\u201cRot\u201d I said.",

    "I heard Poirot\u2019s warning cry\u2014saw him leaping towards me\u2014\nmy hand touched the matchbox.",
    "Then\u2014a flash of blue flame\u2014an earrending crash\u2014and darkness\u2014\nI came to myself to find the familiar face of our old friend Dr. Ridgeway bending over me.",
    "An expression of relief passed over his features.",
    "\u201cKeep still\u201d he said soothingly.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re all right.",
    "There\u2019s been an accident you\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I murmured.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re in my digs.",

    "\u201cNot dead Not dead\u201d\nRidgeway bowed his head his features working with emotion.",
    "With desperate energy I pulled myself to a sitting position.",

    "That as a matter of fact\nit was I who actually precipitated the catastrophe never ceased to fill me with unavailing\nremorse.",
    "It was Dr. Ridgeway said a perfect miracle that I had not been killed but had\nescaped with a slight concussion.",
    "Although it had seemed to me as though I regained consciousness almost immediately it\nwas in reality over twentyfour hours before I came back to life.",
    "It was not until the evening\nof the day following that I was able to stagger feebly into an adjoining room and view with\ndeep emotion the plain elm coffin which held the remains of one of the most marvellous men\nthis world has ever known.",
    "From the very first moment of regaining consciousness I had had only one purpose in\nmind\u2014to avenge Poirot\u2019s death and to hunt down the Big Four remorselessly.",
    "I had thought that Ridgeway would have been of one mind with me about this but to my\nsurprise the good doctor seemed unaccountably lukewarm.",

    "Why\nattempt the impossible Put as delicately as possible his opinion amounted to this If\nPoirot the unique Poirot had failed was it likely that I should succeed\nBut I was obstinate.",
    "Putting aside any question as to whether I had the necessary\nqualifications for the task and I may say in passing that I did not entirely agree with his\nviews on this point I had worked so long with Poirot that I knew his methods by heart and\nfelt fully capable of taking up the work where he had laid it down it was with me a\nquestion of feeling.",
    "My friend had been foully murdered.",
    "Was I to go tamely back to South\nAmerica without an effort to bring his murderers to justice\nI said all this and more to Ridgeway who listened attentively enough.",
    "\u201cAll the same\u201d he said when I had finished \u201cmy advice does not vary.",
    "I am earnestly\nconvinced that Poirot himself if he were here would urge you to return.",
    "In his name I beg\nof you Hastings abandon these wild ideas and go back to your ranch.\u201d\nTo that only one answer was possible and shaking his head sadly he said no more.",
    "It was a month before I was fully restored to health.",
    "Towards the end of April I sought\nand obtained an interview with the Home Secretary.",
    "Mr. Crowther\u2019s manner was reminiscent of that of Dr. Ridgeway.",
    "It was soothing and\nnegative.",
    "Whilst appreciating the offer of my services he gently and considerately declined\n\n\fthem.",
    "The papers referred to by Poirot had passed into his keeping and he assured me that\nall possible steps were being taken to deal with the approaching menace.",
    "With that cold comfort I was forced to be satisfied.",
    "Mr. Crowther ended the interview\nby urging me to return to South America.",
    "I found the whole thing profoundly unsatisfactory.",
    "I should I suppose in its proper place have described Poirot\u2019s funeral.",
    "It was a\nsolemn and moving ceremony and the extraordinary number of floral tributes passed belief.",
    "They came from high and low alike and bore striking testimony to the place my friend had\nmade for himself in the country of his adoption.",
    "For myself I was frankly overcome by\nemotion as I stood by the graveside and thought of all our varied experiences and the happy\ndays we had passed together.",
    "By the beginning of May I had mapped out a plan of campaign.",
    "I felt that I could not do\nbetter than keep to Poirot\u2019s scheme of advertising for any information respecting Claud\nDarrell.",
    "I had an advertisement to this effect inserted in a number of morning newspapers\nand I was sitting in a small restaurant in Soho and judging of the effect of the advertisement\nwhen a small paragraph in another part of the paper gave me a nasty shock.",
    "Very briefly it reported the mysterious disappearance of Mr. John Ingles from the S.S.\nShanghai shortly after the latter had left Marseilles.",
    "Although the weather was perfectly\nsmooth it was feared that the unfortunate gentleman must have fallen overboard.",
    "The\nparagraph ended with a brief reference to Mr. Ingles\u2019s long and distinguished service in\nChina.",
    "The news was unpleasant.",
    "I read into Ingles\u2019s death a sinister motive.",
    "Not for one\nmoment did I believe the theory of an accident.",
    "Ingles had been murdered and his death was\nonly too clearly the handiwork of that accursed Big Four.",
    "As I sat there stunned by the blow and turning the whole matter over in my mind I was\nstartled by the remarkable behaviour of the man sitting opposite me.",
    "So far I had not paid\nmuch attention to him.",
    "He was a thin dark man of middle age sallow of complexion with a\nsmall pointed beard.",
    "He had sat down opposite me so quietly that I had hardly noticed his\narrival.",
    "But his actions now were decidedly peculiar to say the least of them.",
    "Leaning forward\nhe deliberately helped me to salt putting it in four little heaps round the edge of my plate.",
    "\u201cYou will excuse me\u201d he said in a melancholy voice.",
    "\u201cTo help a stranger to salt is to\nhelp them to sorrow they say.",
    "That may be an unavoidable necessity.",
    "I hope not though.",
    "I\nhope that you will be reasonable.\u201d\nThen with a certain significance he repeated his operations with the salt on his own\nplate.",
    "The symbol 4 was too plain to be missed.",
    "I looked at him searchingly.",
    "In no way that I\ncould see did he resemble the young Templeton or James the footman or any other of the\nvarious personalities we had come across.",
    "Nevertheless I was convinced that I had to do\nwith no less than the redoubtable Number Four himself.",
    "In his voice there was certainly a\nfaint resemblance to the buttonedup stranger who had called upon us in Paris.",
    "I looked round undecided as to my course of action.",
    "Reading my thoughts he smiled\nand gently shook his head.",
    "\u201cI should not advise it\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cRemember what came of your hasty action in\nParis.",
    "Let me assure you that my way of retreat is well assured.",
    "Your ideas are inclined to\nbe a little crude Captain Hastings if I may say so.\u201d\n\u201cYou devil\u201d I said choking with rage \u201cyou incarnate devil\u201d\n\u201cHeated\u2014just a trifle heated.",
    "Your late lamented friend would have told you that a man\nwho keeps calm has always a great advantage.\u201d\n\u201cYou dare to speak of him\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cThe man you murdered so foully.",
    "And you come\nhere\u2014\u201d\nHe interrupted me.",
    "\u201cI came here for an excellent and peaceful purpose.",
    "To advise you to return at once to\nSouth America.",
    "If you do so that is the end of the matter as far as the Big Four are\nconcerned.",
    "You and yours will not be molested in any way.",
    "I give you my word as to that.\u201d\nI laughed scornfully.",
    "\u201cAnd if I refuse to obey your autocratic command\u201d\n\u201cIt is hardly a command.",
    "Shall we say that it is\u2014a warning\u201d\nThere was a cold menace in his tone.",
    "\u201cThe first warning\u201d he said softly.",
    "\u201cYou will be well advised not to disregard it.\u201d\nThen before I had any hint of his intention he rose and slipped quickly away towards\nthe door.",
    "I sprang to my feet and was after him in a second but by bad luck I cannoned\nstraight into an enormously fat man who blocked the way between me and the next table.",
    "By\nthe time I had disentangled myself my quarry was just passing through the doorway and the\nnext delay was from a waiter carrying a huge pile of plates who crashed into me without the\nleast warning.",
    "By the time I got to the door there was no sign of the thin man with the dark\nbeard.",
    "The waiter was fulsome in apologies the fat man was sitting placidly at a table\nordering his lunch.",
    "There was nothing to show that both occurrences had not been a pure\naccident.",
    "Nevertheless I had my own opinion as to that.",
    "I knew well enough that the agents\nof the Big Four were everywhere.",
    "Needless to say I paid no heed to the warning given me.",
    "I would do or die in the good\ncause.",
    "I received in all only two answers to the advertisements.",
    "Neither of them gave me\nany information of value.",
    "They were both from actors who had played with Claud Darrell at\none time or another.",
    "Neither of them knew him at all intimately and no new light was\nthrown upon the problem of his identity and present whereabouts.",
    "No further sign came from the Big Four until about ten days later.",
    "I was crossing Hyde\nPark lost in thought when a voice rich with a persuasive foreign inflection hailed me.",
    "\u201cCaptain Hastings is it not\u201d\nA big limousine had just drawn up by the pavement.",
    "A woman was leaning out.",
    "Exquisitely dressed in black with wonderful pearls I recognized the lady first known to us\nas Countess Vera Rossakoff and afterwards under a different alias as an agent of the Big\n\n\fFour.",
    "Poirot for some reason or other had always had a sneaking fondness for the countess.",
    "Something in her very flamboyance attracted the little man.",
    "She was he was wont to declare\nin moments of enthusiasm a woman in a thousand.",
    "That she was arrayed against us on the\nside of our bitterest enemies never seemed to weigh in his judgement.",
    "\u201cAh do not pass on\u201d said the countess.",
    "\u201cI have something most important to say to you.",
    "And do not try to have me arrested either for that would be stupid.",
    "You were always a little\nstupid\u2014yes yes it is so.",
    "You are stupid now when you persist in disregarding the warning\nwe sent you.",
    "It is the second warning I bring you.",
    "Leave England at once.",
    "You can do no\ngood here\u2014I tell you that frankly.",
    "You will never accomplish anything.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case\u201d I said stiffly \u201cit seems rather extraordinary that you are all so anxious to\nget me out of the country.\u201d\nThe countess shrugged her shoulders\u2014magnificent shoulders and a magnificent\ngesture.",
    "\u201cFor my part I think that too stupid.",
    "I would leave you here to play about happily.",
    "But\nthe chiefs you see are fearful that some word of yours may give great help to those more\nintelligent than yourself.",
    "Hence\u2014you are to be banished.\u201d\nThe countess appeared to have a flattering idea of my abilities.",
    "I concealed my\nannoyance.",
    "Doubtless this attitude of hers was assumed expressly to annoy me and to give\nme the idea that I was unimportant.",
    "\u201cIt would of course be quite easy to\u2014remove you\u201d she continued \u201cbut I am quite\nsentimental sometimes.",
    "I pleaded for you.",
    "You have a nice little wife somewhere have you\nnot And it would please the poor little man who is dead to know that you were not to be\nkilled.",
    "I always liked him you know.",
    "He was clever\u2014but clever Had it not been a case of\nfour against one I honestly believe he might have been too much for us.",
    "I confess it frankly\u2014\nhe was my master I sent a wreath to the funeral as a token of my admiration\u2014an enormous\none of crimson roses.",
    "Crimson roses express my temperament.\u201d\nI listened in silence and a growing distaste.",
    "\u201cYou have the look of a mule when it puts its ears back and kicks.",
    "Well I have\ndelivered my warning.",
    "Remember this the third warning will come by the hand of the\nDestroyer\u2014\u201d\nShe made a sign and the car whirled away rapidly.",
    "I noted the number mechanically\nbut without the hope that it would lead to anything.",
    "The Big Four were not apt to be careless\nin details.",
    "I went home a little sobered.",
    "One fact had emerged from the countess\u2019s flood of\nvolubility.",
    "I was in real danger of my life.",
    "Though I had no intention of abandoning the\nstruggle I saw that it behoved me to walk warily and adopt every possible precaution.",
    "Whilst I was reviewing all these facts and seeking for the best line of action the\ntelephone bell rang.",
    "I crossed the room and picked up the receiver.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Hallo.",
    "Who\u2019s speaking\u201d\nA crisp voice answered me.",
    "\u201cThis is St. Giles\u2019s Hospital.",
    "We have a Chinaman here knifed in the street and\nbrought in.",
    "He can\u2019t last long.",
    "We rang you up because we found in his pockets a piece of\npaper with your name and address on it.\u201d\nI was very much astonished.",
    "Nevertheless after a moment\u2019s reflection I said that I\nwould come down at once.",
    "St. Giles\u2019s Hospital was I knew down by the docks and it\noccurred to me that the Chinaman might have just come off some ship.",
    "It was on my way down there that a sudden suspicion shot into my mind.",
    "Was the whole\nthing a trap Wherever a Chinaman was there might be the hand of Li Chang Yen.",
    "I\nremembered the adventure of the Baited Trap.",
    "Was the whole thing a ruse on the part of my\nenemies\nA little reflection convinced me that at any rate a visit to the hospital would do no\nharm.",
    "It was probable that the thing was not so much a plot as what is vulgarly known as a\n\u201cplant.\u201d The dying Chinaman would make some revelation to me upon which I should act\nand which would have the result of leading me into the hands of the Big Four.",
    "The thing to\ndo was to preserve an open mind and whilst feigning credulity be secretly on my guard.",
    "On arriving at St. Giles\u2019s Hospital and making my business known I was taken at once\nto the accident ward to the bedside of the man in question.",
    "He lay absolutely still his\neyelids closed and only a very faint movement of the chest showed that he still breathed.",
    "A\ndoctor stood by the bed his fingers on the Chinaman\u2019s pulse.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s almost gone\u201d he whispered to me.",
    "\u201cYou know him eh\u201d\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d\n\u201cThen what was he doing with your name and address in his pocket You are Captain\nHastings aren\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cYes but I can\u2019t explain it any more than you can.\u201d\n\u201cCurious thing.",
    "From his papers he seems to have been the servant of a man called\nIngles\u2014a retired Civil Servant.",
    "Ah you know him do you\u201d he added quickly as I started\nat the name.",
    "Ingles\u2019s servant Then I had seen him before.",
    "Not that I had ever succeeded in being\nable to distinguish one Chinaman from another.",
    "He must have been with Ingles on his way to\nChina and after the catastrophe he had returned to England with a message possibly for\nme.",
    "It was vital imperative that I should hear the message.",
    "\u201cIs he conscious\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cCan he speak Mr. Ingles was an old friend of mine and I\nthink it possible that this poor fellow has brought me a message from him.",
    "Mr. Ingles is\nbelieved to have gone overboard about ten days ago.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just conscious but I doubt if he has the force to speak.",
    "He lost a terrible lot of\nblood you know.",
    "I can administer a stimulant of course but we\u2019ve already done all that is\npossible in that direction.\u201d\nNevertheless he administered a hypodermic injection and I stayed by the bed hoping\n\n\fagainst hope for a word\u2014a sign\u2014that might be of the utmost value to me in my work.",
    "But\nthe minutes sped on and no sign came.",
    "And suddenly a baleful idea shot across my mind.",
    "Was I not already falling into the\ntrap Suppose that this Chinaman had merely assumed the part of Ingles\u2019s servant that he\nwas in reality an agent of the Big Four Had I not once read that certain Chinese priests\nwere capable of simulating death Or to go further still Li Chang Yen might command a\nlittle band of fanatics who would welcome death itself if it came at the command of their\nmaster.",
    "I must be on my guard.",
    "Even as these thoughts flashed across my mind the man in the bed stirred.",
    "His eyes\nopened.",
    "He murmured something incoherently.",
    "Then I saw his glance fasten upon me.",
    "He\nmade no sign of recognition but I was at once aware that he was trying to speak to me.",
    "Be\nhe friend or foe I must hear what he had to say.",
    "I leaned over the bed but the broken sounds conveyed no sort of meaning to me.",
    "I\nthought I caught the word \u201chand\u201d but in what connection it was used I could not tell.",
    "Then it\ncame again and this time I heard another word the word \u201cLargo.\u201d I stared in amazement as\nthe possible juxtaposition of the two suggested itself to me.",
    "\u201cHandel\u2019s Largo\u201d I queried.",
    "The Chinaman\u2019s eyelids flickered rapidly as though in assent and he added another\nItalian word the word \u201ccarrozza.\u201d Two or three more words of murmured Italian came to\nmy ears and then he fell back abruptly.",
    "The doctor pushed me aside.",
    "It was all over.",
    "The man was dead.",
    "I went out into the air again thoroughly bewildered.",
    "\u201cHandel\u2019s Largo\u201d and a \u201ccarrozza.\u201d If I remembered rightly a carrozza was a\ncarriage.",
    "What possible meaning could lie behind those simple words The man was a\nChinaman not an Italian why should he speak in Italian Surely if he were indeed Ingles\u2019s\nservant he must know English The whole thing was profoundly mystifying.",
    "I puzzled over\nit all the way home.",
    "Oh if only Poirot had been there to solve the problem with his lightning\ningenuity\nI let myself in with my latchkey and went slowly up to my room.",
    "A letter was lying on\nthe table and I tore it open carelessly enough.",
    "But in a minute I stood rooted to the ground\nwhilst I read.",
    "It was a communication from a firm of solicitors.",
    "Dear Sir it ran\u2014As instructed by our late client M. Hercule\nPoirot we forward you the enclosed letter.",
    "This letter was placed in our hands a\nweek before his death with instructions that in the event of his demise it should\nbe sent to you at a certain date after his death.",
    "Yours faithfully etc.",
    "I turned the enclosed missive over and over.",
    "It was undoubtably from Poirot.",
    "I knew that\nfamiliar writing only too well.",
    "With a heavy heart yet a certain eagerness I tore it open.",
    "Mon Cher Ami it began\u2014When you receive this I shall be no more.",
    "Do not shed\ntears about me but follow my orders.",
    "Immediately upon receipt of this return to\nSouth America.",
    "Do not be pigheaded about this.",
    "It is not for sentimental reasons\nthat I bid you undertake the journey.",
    "It is necessary.",
    "It is part of the plan of\nHercule Poirot To say more is unnecessary to anyone who has the acute\nintelligence of my friend Hastings.",
    "A bas the Big Four I salute you my friend from beyond the grave.",
    "Ever thine\nHercule Poirot\nI read and reread this astonishing communication.",
    "One thing was evident.",
    "The amazing man\nhad so provided for every eventuality that even his own death did not upset the sequence of\nhis plans Mine was to be the active part\u2014his the directing genius.",
    "Doubtless I should find\nfull instructions awaiting me beyond the seas.",
    "In the meantime my enemies convinced that I\nwas obeying their warning would cease to trouble their heads about me.",
    "I could return\nunsuspected and work havoc in their midst.",
    "There was now nothing to hinder my immediate departure.",
    "I sent off cables booked my\npassage and one week later found me embarking in the Ansonia en route for Buenos Aires.",
    "Just as the boat left the quay a steward brought me a note.",
    "It had been given him so he\nexplained by a big gentleman in a fur coat who had left the boat last thing before the\ngangway planks were lifted.",
    "I opened it.",
    "It was terse and to the point.",
    "\u201cYou are wise\u201d it ran.",
    "It was signed with a big figure 4.",
    "I could afford to smile to myself\nThe sea was not too choppy.",
    "I enjoyed a passable dinner made up my mind as to the\nmajority of my fellow passengers and had a rubber or two of bridge.",
    "Then I turned in and\nslept like a log as I always do on board ship.",
    "I was awakened by feeling myself persistently shaken.",
    "Dazed and bewildered I saw\nthat one of the ship\u2019s officers was standing over me.",
    "He gave a sigh of relief as I sat up.",
    "\u201cThank the Lord I\u2019ve got you awake at last.",
    "I\u2019ve had no end of a job.",
    "Do you always\nsleep like that\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u201d I asked still bewildered and not fully awake.",
    "\u201cIs there anything\nwrong with the ship\u201d\n\u201cI expect you know what\u2019s the matter better than I do\u201d he replied drily.",
    "\u201cSpecial\ninstructions from the Admiralty.",
    "There\u2019s a destroyer waiting to take you off.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cIn midocean\u201d\n\u201cIt seems a most mysterious affair but that\u2019s not my business.",
    "They\u2019ve sent a young\nfellow aboard who is to take your place and we are all sworn to secrecy.",
    "Will you get up\nand dress\u201d\nUtterly unable to conceal my amazement I did as I was told.",
    "A boat was lowered and I\n\n\fwas conveyed aboard the destroyer.",
    "There I was received courteously but got no further\ninformation.",
    "The commander\u2019s instructions were to land me at a certain spot on the Belgian\ncoast.",
    "There his knowledge and responsibility ended.",
    "The whole thing was like a dream.",
    "The one idea I held to firmly was that all this must\nbe part of Poirot\u2019s plan.",
    "I must simply go forward blindly trusting in my dead friend.",
    "I was duly landed at the spot indicated.",
    "There a motor was waiting and soon I was\nrapidly whirling across the flat Flemish plains.",
    "I slept that night at a small hotel in Brussels.",
    "The next day we went on again.",
    "The country became wooded and hilly.",
    "I realized that we\nwere penetrating into the Ardennes and I suddenly remembered Poirot\u2019s saying that he had\na brother who lived at Spa.",
    "But we did not go to Spa itself.",
    "We left the main road and wound into the leafy\nfastnesses of the hills till we reached a little hamlet and an isolated white villa high on the\nhillside.",
    "Here the car stopped in front of the green door of the villa.",
    "The door opened as I alighted.",
    "An elderly manservant stood in the doorway bowing.",

    "\u201cM.",
    "le Capitaine is expected.",
    "If he will\nfollow me.\u201d\nHe led the way across the hall and flung open a door at the back standing aside to let\nme pass in.",
    "I blinked a little for the room faced west and the afternoon sun was pouring in.",
    "Then\nmy vision cleared and I saw a figure waiting to welcome me with outstretched hands.",
    "It was\u2014oh impossible it couldn\u2019t be\u2014but yes\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried and for once did not attempt to evade the embrace with which he\noverwhelmed me.",
    "\u201cBut yes but yes it is indeed I Not so easy to kill Hercule Poirot\u201d\n\u201cBut Poirot\u2014why\u201d\n\u201cA ruse de guerre my friend a ruse de guerre.",
    "All is now ready for our grand coup.\u201d\n\u201cBut you might have told me\u201d\n\u201cNo Hastings I could not.",
    "Never never in a thousand years could you have acted the\npart at the funeral.",
    "As it was it was perfect.",

    "We were plentifully supplied with newspapers and every day Poirot received a\nbulky envelope evidently containing some kind of report.",
    "He never showed these reports to\nme but I could usually tell from his manner whether their contents had been satisfactory or\notherwise.",

    "\u201cAs a minor point Hastings\u201d he remarked one day \u201cI was in continual fear of your\ndeath lying at my door.",

    "I reminded him that once or twice the honours of the game had lain with our\nadversaries.",
    "But I might have known that it was impossible to diminish Hercule Poirot\u2019s\nenthusiasm for his own methods.",
    "\u201cSee you Hastings it is like the little trick that you play with the cards.",

    "That is\nmy object.",
    "So far I have been contending now against one of the Big Four now against\nanother.",
    "But let me get them all together like the four knaves in the pack of cards and then\nwith one coup I destroy them all\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do you propose to get them all together\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cBy awaiting the supreme moment.",
    "By lying perdus until they are ready to strike.\u201d\n\u201cThat may mean a long wait\u201d I grumbled.",
    "\u201cAlways impatient the good Hastings But no it will not be so long.",
    "The one man they\nwere afraid of\u2014myself\u2014is out of the way.",
    "I give them two or three months at most.\u201d\nHis speaking of someone being got out of the way reminded me of Ingles and his tragic\n\n\fdeath and I remembered that I had never told Poirot about the dying Chinaman in St. Giles\u2019s\nHospital.",
    "He listened with keen attention to my story.",
    "\u201cIngles\u2019s servant eh And the few words he uttered were in Italian Curious.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I suspected it might have been a plant on the part of the Big Four.\u201d\n\u201cYour reasoning is at fault Hastings.",
    "Employ the little grey cells.",
    "If your enemies\nwished to deceive you they would assuredly have seen to it that the Chinaman spoke in\nintelligible pidgin English.",
    "No the message was genuine.",
    "Tell me again all that you heard\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all he made a reference to Handel\u2019s Largo and then he said something that\nsounded like \u2018carrozza\u2019\u2014that\u2019s a carriage isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cNothing else\u201d\n\u201cWell just at the end he murmured something like \u2018Cara\u2019 somebody or other\u2014some\nwoman\u2019s name.",
    "Zia I think.",
    "But I don\u2019t suppose that that had any bearing on the rest of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou would not suppose so Hastings.",
    "Cara Zia is very important very important\nindeed.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy dear friend you never see\u2014and anyway the English know no geography.\u201d\n\u201cGeography\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cWhat has geography got to do with it\u201d\n\u201cI dare say M. Thomas Cook would be more to the point.\u201d\nAs usual Poirot refused to say anything more\u2014a most irritating trick of his.",
    "But I\nnoticed that his manner became extremely cheerful as though he had scored some point or\nother.",
    "The days went on pleasant if a trifle monotonous.",
    "There were plenty of books in the\nvilla and delightful rambles all around but I chafed sometimes at the forced inactivity of\nour life and marvelled at Poirot\u2019s state of placid content.",
    "Nothing occurred to ruffle our\nquiet existence and it was not until the end of June well within the limit that Poirot had\ngiven them that we had our news of the Big Four.",
    "A car drove up to the villa early one morning such an unusual event in our peaceful life\nthat I hurried down to satisfy my curiosity.",
    "I found Poirot talking to a pleasantfaced young\nfellow of about my own age.",
    "He introduced me.",
    "\u201cThis is Captain Harvey Hastings one of the most famous members of your\nIntelligence Service.\u201d\n\u201cNot famous at all I\u2019m afraid\u201d said the young man laughing pleasantly.",
    "\u201cNot famous except to those in the know I should have said.",
    "Most of Captain Harvey\u2019s\nfriends and acquaintances consider him an amiable but brainless young man\u2014devoted only\nto the trot of the fox or whatever the dance is called.\u201d\n\n\fWe both laughed.",
    "\u201cWell well to business\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou are of opinion the time has come then\u201d\n\u201cWe are sure of it sir.",
    "China was isolated politically yesterday.",
    "What is going on out\nthere nobody knows.",
    "No news of any kind wireless or otherwise has come through\u2014just a\ncomplete break\u2014and silence\u201d\n\u201cLi Chang Yen has shown his hand.",
    "And the others\u201d\n\u201cAbe Ryland arrived in England a week ago and left for the Continent yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Madame Olivier\u201d\n\u201cMadame Olivier left Paris last night.\u201d\n\u201cFor Italy\u201d\n\u201cFor Italy sir.",
    "As far as we can judge they are both making for the resort you indicated\n\u2014though how you knew that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh that is not the cap with the feather for me That was the work of Hastings here.",
    "He\nconceals his intelligence you comprehend but it is profound for all that.\u201d\nHarvey looked at me with due appreciation and I felt rather uncomfortable.",
    "\u201cAll is in train then\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He was pale now and completely serious.",
    "\u201cThe time\nhas come.",
    "The arrangements are all made\u201d\n\u201cEverything you ordered has been carried out.",
    "The governments of Italy France and\nEngland are behind you and are all working harmoniously together.\u201d\n\u201cIt is in fact a new Entente\u201d observed Poirot drily.",
    "\u201cI am glad that Desjardeaux is\nconvinced at last.",
    "Eh bien then we will start\u2014or rather I will start.",
    "You Hastings will\nremain here\u2014yes I pray of you.",
    "In verity my friend I am serious.\u201d\nI believe him but it was not likely that I should consent to being left behind in that\nfashion.",
    "Our argument was short but decisive.",
    "It was not until we were in the train speeding towards Paris that he admitted that he\nwas secretly glad of my decision.",
    "\u201cFor you have a part to play Hastings.",
    "An important part Without you I might well\nfail.",
    "Nevertheless I felt that it was my duty to urge you to remain behind\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere is danger then\u201d\n\u201cMon ami where there is the Big Four there is always danger.\u201d\nOn arrival in Paris we drove across to the Gare de l\u2019Est and Poirot at last announced\nour destination.",
    "We were bound for Bolzano and the Italian Tyrol.",
    "During Harvey\u2019s absence from our carriage I took the opportunity of asking Poirot why\nhe had said that the discovery of the rendezvous was my work.",
    "\u201cBecause it was my friend.",
    "How Ingles managed to get hold of the information I do not\nknow but he did and he sent it to us by his servant.",
    "We are bound mon ami for Karersee\n\n\fthe new Italian name for which is Lago di Carrezza.",
    "You see now where your \u2018Cara Zia\u2019\ncomes in and also your \u2018Carrozza\u2019 and \u2018Largo\u2019\u2014the Handel was supplied by your own\nimagination.",
    "Possibly some reference to the information coming from the \u2018hand\u2019 of Mr.\nIngles started the train of association.\u201d\n\u201cKarersee\u201d I queried.",
    "\u201cI never heard of it.\u201d\n\u201cI always tell you that the English know no geography.",
    "But as a matter of fact it is a\nwell known and very beautiful summer resort four thousand feet up in the heart of the\nDolomites.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it is in this out of the way spot that the Big Four have their rendezvous\u201d\n\u201cSay rather their headquarters.",
    "The signal has been given and it is their intention to\ndisappear from the world and issue orders from their mountain fastness.",
    "I have made the\nenquiries\u2014a lot of quarrying of stone and mineral deposits is done there and the company\napparently a small Italian firm is in reality controlled by Abe Ryland.",
    "I am prepared to\nswear that a vast subterranean dwelling has been hollowed out in the very heart of the\nmountain secret and inaccessible.",
    "From there the leaders of the organization will issue by\nwireless their orders to their followers who are numbered by thousands in every country.",
    "And from that crag in the Dolomites the dictators of the world will emerge.",
    "That is to say\u2014\nthey would emerge were it not for Hercule Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cDo you seriously believe all this Poirot\u2014What about the armies and general\nmachinery of civilization\u201d\n\u201cWhat about it in Russia Hastings This will be Russia on an infinitely larger scale\u2014\nand with this additional menace\u2014that Madame Olivier\u2019s experiments have proceeded\nfurther than she has ever given out.",
    "I believe that she has to a certain extent succeeded in\nliberating atomic energy and harnessing it to her purpose.",
    "Her experiments with the nitrogen\nof the air have been very remarkable and she has also experimented in the concentration of\nwireless energy so that a beam of great intensity can be focused upon some given spot.",
    "Exactly how far she has progressed nobody knows but it is certain that it is much farther\nthan has ever been given out.",
    "She is a genius that woman\u2014the Curies were as nothing to\nher.",
    "Add to her genius the powers of Ryland\u2019s almost unlimited wealth and with the brain\nof Li Chang Yen the finest criminal brain ever known to direct and plan\u2014eh bien it will\nnot be as you say all jam for civilization.\u201d\nHis words made me very thoughtful.",
    "Although Poirot was given at times to exaggeration\nof language he was not really an alarmist.",
    "For the first time I realized what a desperate\nstruggle it was upon which we were engaged.",
    "Harvey soon rejoined us and the journey went on.",
    "We arrived at Bolzano about midday.",
    "From there the journey on was by motor.",
    "Several\nbig blue motor cars were waiting in the central square of the town and we three got into one\nof them.",
    "Poirot notwithstanding the heat of the day was muffled to the eyes in greatcoat and\nscarf.",
    "His eyes and the tips of his ears were all that could be seen of him.",
    "I did not know whether this was due to precaution at merely his exaggerated fear of\ncatching a chill.",
    "The motor journey took a couple of hours.",
    "It was a really wonderful drive.",
    "For the first part of the way we wound in and out of huge cliffs with a trickling waterfall on\none hand.",
    "Then we emerged into a fertile valley which continued for some miles and then\nstill winding steadily upwards the bare rock peaks began to show with dense clustering\npinewoods at their base.",
    "The whole place was wild and lovely.",
    "Finally a series of abrupt\ncurves with the road running through the pinewoods on either side and we came suddenly\nupon a big hotel and found we had arrived.",
    "Our rooms had been reserved for us and under Harvey\u2019s guidance we went straight up\nto them.",
    "They looked straight out over the rocky peaks and the long slopes of pinewoods\nleading up to them.",
    "Poirot made a gesture towards them.",
    "\u201cIt is there\u201d he asked in a low voice.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d replied Harvey.",
    "\u201cThere is a place called the Felsenlabyrinth\u2014all big boulders\npiled about in a most fantastic way\u2014a path winds through them.",
    "The quarrying is to the right\nof that but we think that the entrance is probably in the Felsenlabyrinth.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cCome mon ami\u201d he said to me.",
    "\u201cLet us go down and sit upon the terrace and enjoy\nthe sunlight.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that wise\u201d I asked.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders.",
    "The sunlight was marvellous\u2014in fact the glare was almost too great for me.",
    "We had\nsome creamy coffee instead of tea then went upstairs and unpacked our few belongings.",
    "Poirot was in his most unapproachable mood lost in a kind of reverie.",
    "Once or twice he\nshook his head and sighed.",
    "I had been rather intrigued by a man who had got out of our train at Bolzano and had\nbeen met by a private car.",
    "He was a small man and one thing about him that attracted my\nattention was that he was almost as much muffled up as Poirot had been.",
    "More so indeed\nfor in addition to greatcoat and muffler he was wearing huge blue spectacles.",
    "I was\nconvinced that here we had an emissary of the Big Four.",
    "Poirot did not seem very impressed\nby my idea.",
    "But when leaning out of my bedroom window I reported that the man in\nquestion was strolling about in the vicinity of the hotel he admitted that there might be\nsomething in it.",
    "I urged my friend not to go down to dinner but he insisted on doing so.",
    "We entered the\ndining room rather late and were shown to a table by the window.",
    "As we sat down our\nattention was attracted by an exclamation and a crash of falling china.",
    "A dish of haricots\nverts had been upset over a man who was sitting at the table next to ours.",
    "The head waiter came up and was vociferous in apologies.",
    "Presently when the offending waiter was serving us with soup Poirot spoke to him.",
    "\u201cAn unfortunate accident that.",
    "But it was not your fault.\u201d\n\u201cMonsieur saw that No indeed it was not my fault.",
    "The gentleman half sprang up from\nhis chair\u2014I thought he was going to have an attack of some kind.",
    "I could not save the\n\n\fcatastrophe.\u201d\nI saw Poirot\u2019s eyes shining with the green light I knew so well and as the waiter\ndeparted he said to me in a low voice\n\u201cYou see Hastings the effect of Hercule Poirot\u2014alive and in the flesh\u201d\n\u201cYou think\u2014\u201d\nI had not time to continue.",
    "I felt Poirot\u2019s hand on my knee as he whispered excitedly\n\u201cLook Hastings look.",
    "His trick with the bread Number Four\u201d\nSure enough the man at the next table to ours his face unusually pale was dabbing a\nsmall piece of bread mechanically about the table.",
    "I studied him carefully.",
    "His face cleanshaven and puffily fat was of a pasty unhealthy\nsallowness with heavy pouches under the eyes and deep lines running from his nose to the\ncorners of his mouth.",
    "His age might have been anything from thirtyfive to fortyfive.",
    "In no\nparticular did he resemble any one of the characters which Number Four had previously\nassumed.",
    "Indeed had it not been for his little trick with the bread of which he was\nevidently quite unaware I would have sworn readily enough that the man sitting there was\nsomeone whom I had never seen before.",
    "\u201cHe has recognized you\u201d I murmured.",
    "\u201cYou should not have come down.\u201d\n\u201cMy excellent Hastings I have feigned death for three months for this one purpose.\u201d\n\u201cTo startle Number Four\u201d\n\u201cTo startle him at a moment when he must act quickly or not at all.",
    "And we have this\ngreat advantage\u2014he does not know that we recognize him.",
    "He thinks that he is safe in his\nnew disguise.",
    "How I bless Flossie Monro for telling us of that little habit of his.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will happen now\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cWhat can happen He recognizes the only man he fears miraculously resurrected from\nthe dead at the very minute when the plans of the Big Four are in the balance.",
    "Madame\nOlivier and Abe Ryland lunched here today and it is thought that they went to Cortina.",
    "Only\nwe know that they have retired to their hiding place.",
    "How much do we know That is what\nNumber Four is asking himself at this minute.",
    "He dare take no risks.",
    "I must be suppressed at\nall costs.",
    "Eh bien let him try to suppress Hercule Poirot I shall be ready for him.\u201d\nAs he finished speaking the man at the next table got up and went out.",
    "\u201cHe has gone to make his little arrangements\u201d said Poirot placidly.",
    "\u201cShall we have our\ncoffee on the terrace my friend It would be pleasanter I think.",
    "I will just go up and get a\ncoat.\u201d\nI went out on to the terrace a little disturbed in mind.",
    "Poirot\u2019s assurance did not quite\ncontent me.",
    "However so long as we were on guard nothing could happen to us.",
    "I resolved\nto keep thoroughly on the alert.",
    "It was quite five minutes before Poirot joined me.",
    "With his usual precautions against\ncold he was muffled up to the ears.",
    "He sat down beside me and sipped his coffee\n\n\fappreciatively.",
    "\u201cOnly in England is the coffee so atrocious\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cOn the Continent they\nunderstand how important it is for the digestion that it should be properly made.\u201d\nAs he finished speaking the man from the next table suddenly appeared on the terrace.",
    "Without any hesitation he came over and drew up a third chair to our table.",
    "\u201cYou do not mind my joining you I hope\u201d he said in English.",
    "\u201cNot at all monsieur\u201d said Poirot.",
    "I felt very uneasy.",
    "It is true that we were on the terrace of the hotel with people all\naround us but nevertheless I was not satisfied.",
    "I sensed the presence of danger.",
    "Meanwhile Number Four chatted away in a perfectly natural manner.",
    "It seemed\nimpossible to believe that he was anything but a bona fide tourist.",
    "He described excursions\nand motor trips and posed as quite an authority on the neighbourhood.",
    "He took a pipe from his pocket and began to light it.",
    "Poirot drew out his case of tiny\ncigarettes.",
    "As he placed one between his lips the stranger leant forward with a match.",
    "\u201cLet me give you a light.\u201d\nAs he spoke without the least warning all the lights went out.",
    "There was a chink of\nglass and something pungent under my nose suffocating me\u2014\n\n\fEighteen\nIN THE FELSENLABYRINTH\n\nI could not have been unconscious more than a minute.",
    "I came to myself being hustled along\nbetween two men.",
    "They had me under each arm supporting my weight and there was a gag\nin my mouth.",
    "It was pitch dark but I gathered that we were not outside but passing through\nthe hotel.",
    "All round I could hear people shouting and demanding in every known language\nwhat had happened to the lights.",
    "My captors swung me down some stairs.",
    "We passed along\na basement passage then through a door and out into the open again through a glass door at\nthe back of the hotel.",
    "In another moment we had gained the shelter of the pine trees.",
    "I had caught a glimpse of another figure in a similar plight to myself and realized that\nPoirot too was a victim of this bold coup.",
    "By sheer audacity Number Four had won the day.",
    "He had employed I gathered an\ninstant anaesthetic probably ethyl chloride\u2014breaking a small bulb of it under our noses.",
    "Then in the confusion of the darkness his accomplices who had probably been guests\nsitting at the next table had thrust gags in our mouths and hurried us away taking us through\nthe hotel to baffle pursuit.",
    "I cannot describe the hour that followed.",
    "We were hurried through the woods at a\nbreakneck pace going uphill the whole time.",
    "At last we emerged in the open on the\nmountainside and I saw just in front of us an extraordinary conglomeration of fantastic\nrocks and boulders.",
    "This must be the Felsenlabyrinth of which Harvey had spoken.",
    "Soon we were winding\nin and out of its recesses.",
    "The place was like a maze devised by some evil genie.",
    "Suddenly we stopped.",
    "An enormous rock barred our path.",
    "One of the men stopped and\nseemed to push on something when without a sound the huge mass of rock turned on itself\nand disclosed a small tunnellike opening leading into the mountainside.",
    "Into this we were hurried.",
    "For some time the tunnel was narrow but presently it\nwidened and before very long we came out into a wide rocky chamber lighted by\nelectricity.",
    "Then the gags were removed.",
    "At a sign from Number Four who stood facing us\nwith mocking triumph in his face we were searched and every article was removed from\nour pockets including Poirot\u2019s little automatic pistol.",
    "A pang smote me as it was tossed down on the table.",
    "We were defeated\u2014hopelessly\ndefeated and outnumbered.",
    "It was the end.",
    "\u201cWelcome to the headquarters of the Big Four M. Hercule Poirot\u201d said Number Four\nin a mocking tone.",
    "\u201cTo meet you again is an unexpected pleasure.",
    "But was it worthwhile\nreturning from the grave only for this\u201d\nPoirot did not reply.",
    "I dared not look at him.",
    "\u201cCome this way\u201d continued Number Four.",
    "\u201cYour arrival will be somewhat of a\nsurprise to my colleagues.\u201d\nHe indicated a narrow doorway in the wall.",
    "We passed through and found ourselves in\nanother chamber.",
    "At the very end of it was a table behind which four chairs were placed.",
    "The end chair was empty but it was draped with a mandarin\u2019s cape.",
    "On the second\nsmoking a cigar sat Mr. Abe Ryland.",
    "Leaning back on the third chair with her burning eyes\nand her nun\u2019s face was Madame Olivier.",
    "Number Four took his seat on the fourth chair.",
    "We were in the presence of the Big Four.",
    "Never before had I felt so fully the reality and the presence of Li Chang Yen as I did\nnow when confronting his empty seat.",
    "Far away in China he yet controlled and directed this\nmalign organization.",
    "Madame Olivier gave a faint cry on seeing us.",
    "Ryland more selfcontrolled only\nshifted his cigar and raised his grizzled eyebrows.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Hercule Poirot\u201d said Ryland slowly.",
    "\u201cThis is a pleasant surprise.",
    "You put it over\non us all right.",
    "We thought you were good and buried.",
    "No matter the game is up now.\u201d\nThere was a ring as of steel in his voice.",
    "Madame Olivier said nothing but her eyes\nburned and I disliked the slow way she smiled.",
    "\u201cMadame and messieurs I wish you good evening\u201d said Poirot quietly.",
    "Something unexpected something I had not been prepared to hear in his voice made me\nlook at him.",
    "He seemed quite composed.",
    "Yet there was something about his whole\nappearance that was different.",
    "Then there was a stir of draperies behind us and the Countess Vera Rossakoff came in.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d said Number Four.",
    "\u201cOur valued and trusted lieutenant.",
    "An old friend of yours is\nhere my dear lady.\u201d\nThe countess whirled round with her usual vehemence of movement.",
    "\u201cGod in Heaven\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cIt is the little man Ah but he has the nine lives of a cat\nOh little man little man Why did you mix yourself up in this\u201d\n\u201cMadame\u201d said Poirot with a bow.",
    "\u201cMe like the great Napoleon I am on the side of\nthe big battalions.\u201d\nAs he spoke I saw a sudden suspicion flash into her eyes and at the same moment I\nknew the truth which subconsciously I already sensed.",
    "The man beside me was not Hercule Poirot.",
    "He was very like him extraordinarily like him.",
    "There was the same eggshaped head\nthe same strutting figure delicately plump.",
    "But the voice was different and the eyes instead\nof being green were dark and surely the moustaches\u2014those famous moustaches\u2014\nMy reflections were cut short by the countess\u2019s voice.",
    "She stepped forward her voice\nringing with excitement.",
    "\u201cYou have been deceived.",
    "This man is not Hercule Poirot\u201d\n\n\fNumber Four uttered an incredulous exclamation but the countess leant forward and\nsnatched at Poirot\u2019s moustaches.",
    "They came off in her hand and then indeed the truth was\nplain.",
    "For this man\u2019s upper lip was disfigured by a small scar which completely altered the\nexpression of the face.",
    "\u201cNot Hercule Poirot\u201d muttered Number Four.",
    "\u201cBut who can he be then\u201d\n\u201cI know\u201d I cried suddenly and then stopped dead afraid I had ruined everything.",
    "But the man I will still refer to as Poirot had turned to me encouragingly.",
    "\u201cSay it if you will.",
    "It makes no matter now.",
    "The trick has succeeded.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Achille Poirot\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cHercule Poirot\u2019s twin brother.\u201d\n\u201cImpossible\u201d said Ryland sharply but he was shaken.",
    "\u201cHercule\u2019s plan has succeeded to a marvel\u201d said Achille placidly.",
    "Number Four leapt forward his voice harsh and menacing.",
    "\u201cSucceeded has it\u201d he snarled.",
    "\u201cDo you realize that before many minutes have passed\nyou will be dead\u2014dead\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Achille Poirot gravely.",
    "\u201cI realize that.",
    "It is you who do not realize that a\nman may be willing to purchase success by his life.",
    "There were men who laid down their\nlives for their country in the war.",
    "I am prepared to lay down mine in the same way for the\nworld.\u201d\nIt struck me just then that although perfectly willing to lay down my life I might have\nbeen consulted in the matter.",
    "Then I remembered how Poirot had urged me to stay behind\nand I felt appeased.",
    "\u201cAnd in what way will your laying down your life benefit the world\u201d asked Ryland\nsardonically.",
    "\u201cI see that you do not perceive the true inwardness of Hercule\u2019s plan.",
    "To begin with\nyour place of retreat was known some months ago and practically all the visitors hotel\nassistants and others are detectives or Secret Service men.",
    "A cordon has been drawn round\nthe mountain.",
    "You may have more than one means of egress but even so you cannot escape.",
    "Poirot himself is directing the operations outside.",
    "My boots were smeared with a\npreparation of aniseed tonight before I came down to the terrace in my brother\u2019s place.",
    "Hounds are following the trail.",
    "It will lead them infallibly to the rock in the Felsenlabyrinth\nwhere the entrance is situated.",
    "You see do what you will to us the net is drawn tightly\nround you.",
    "You cannot escape.\u201d\nMadame Olivier laughed suddenly.",
    "\u201cYou are wrong.",
    "There is one way we can escape and like Samson of old destroy\nour enemies at the same time.",
    "What do you say my friends\u201d\nRyland was staring at Achille Poirot.",
    "\u201cSuppose he\u2019s lying\u201d he said hoarsely.",
    "The other shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cIn an hour it will be dawn.",
    "Then you can see for yourself the truth of my words.",
    "Already they should have traced me to the entrance in the Felsenlabyrinth.\u201d\nEven as he spoke there was a faroff reverberation and a man ran in shouting\nincoherently.",
    "Ryland sprang up and went out.",
    "Madame Olivier moved to the end of the room\nand opened a door that I had not noticed.",
    "Inside I caught a glimpse of a perfectly equipped\nlaboratory which reminded me of the one in Paris.",
    "Number Four also sprang up and went\nout.",
    "He returned with Poirot\u2019s revolver which he gave to the countess.",
    "\u201cThere is no danger of their escaping\u201d he said grimly.",
    "\u201cBut still you had better have\nthis.\u201d\nThen he went out again.",
    "The countess came over to us and surveyed my companion attentively for some time.",
    "Suddenly she laughed.",
    "\u201cYou are very clever M. Achille Poirot\u201d she said mockingly.",
    "\u201cMadame let us talk business.",
    "It is fortunate that they have left us alone together.",
    "What\nis your price\u201d\n\u201cI do not understand.",
    "What price\u201d\n\u201cMadame you can aid us to escape.",
    "You know the secret way out of this retreat.",
    "I ask\nyou what is your price\u201d\nShe laughed again.",
    "\u201cMore than you could pay little man Why all the money in the world would not buy\nme\u201d\n\u201cMadame I did not speak of money.",
    "I am a man of intelligence.",
    "Nevertheless this is a\ntrue fact\u2014everyone has his price In exchange for life and liberty I offer you your heart\u2019s\ndesire.\u201d\n\u201cSo you are a magician\u201d\n\u201cYou can call me so if you like.\u201d\nThe countess suddenly dropped her jesting manner.",
    "She spoke with passionate\nbitterness.",
    "\u201cFool My heart\u2019s desire Can you give me revenge upon my enemies Can you give me\nback youth and beauty and a gay heart Can you bring the dead to life again\u201d\nAchille Poirot was watching her very curiously.",
    "\u201cWhich of the three Madame Make your choice.\u201d\nShe laughed sardonically.",
    "\u201cYou will send me the Elixir of Life perhaps Come I will make a bargain with you.",
    "Once I had a child.",
    "Find my child for me\u2014and you shall go free.\u201d\n\u201cMadame I agree.",
    "It is a bargain.",
    "Your child shall be restored to you.",
    "On the faith of\u2014\non the faith of Hercule Poirot himself.\u201d\n\n\fAgain that strange woman laughed\u2014this time long and unrestrainedly.",
    "\u201cMy dear M. Poirot I am afraid I laid a little trap for you.",
    "It is very kind of you to\npromise to find my child for me but you see I happen to know that you would not succeed\nand so that would be a very onesided bargain would it not\u201d\n\u201cMadame I swear to you by the Holy Angels that I will restore your child to you.\u201d\n\u201cI asked you before M. Poirot could you restore the dead to life\u201d\n\u201cThen the child is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDead Yes.\u201d\nHe stepped forward and took her wrist.",
    "\u201cMadame I\u2014I who speak to you swear once more.",
    "I will bring the dead back to\nlife.\u201d\nShe stared at him as though fascinated.",
    "\u201cYou do not believe me.",
    "I will prove my words.",
    "Get my pocketbook which they took\nfrom me.\u201d\nShe went out of the room and returned with it in her hand.",
    "Throughout all she retained\nher grip on the revolver.",
    "I felt that Achille Poirot\u2019s chances of bluffing her were very slight.",
    "The Countess Vera Rossakoff was no fool.",
    "\u201cOpen it madame.",
    "The flap on the lefthand side.",
    "That is right.",
    "Now take out that\nphotograph and look at it.\u201d\nWonderingly she took out what seemed to be a small snapshot.",
    "No sooner had she\nlooked at it than she uttered a cry and swayed as though about to fall.",
    "Then she almost flew\nat my companion.",
    "\u201cWhere Where You shall tell me.",
    "Where\u201d\n\u201cRemember your bargain madame.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes I will trust you.",
    "Quick before they come back.\u201d\nCatching him by the hand she drew him quickly and silently out of the room.",
    "I\nfollowed.",
    "From the outer room she led us into the tunnel by which we had first entered but\na short way along this forked and she turned off to the right.",
    "Again and again the passage\ndivided but she led us on never faltering or seeming to doubt her way and with increasing\nspeed.",
    "\u201cIf only we are in time\u201d she panted.",
    "\u201cWe must be out in the open before the explosion\noccurs.\u201d\nStill we went on.",
    "I understood that this tunnel led right through the mountain and that we\nshould finally emerge on the other side facing a different valley.",
    "The sweat streamed down\nmy face but I raced on.",
    "And then far away I saw a gleam of daylight.",
    "Nearer and nearer.",
    "I saw green bushes\ngrowing.",
    "We forced them aside pushed our way through.",
    "We were in the open again with\n\n\fthe faint light of dawn making everything rosy.",
    "Poirot\u2019s cordon was a reality.",
    "Even as we emerged three men fell upon us but\nreleased us again with a cry of astonishment.",
    "\u201cQuick\u201d cried my companion.",
    "\u201cQuick\u2014there is no time to lose\u2014\u201d\nBut he was not destined to finish.",
    "The earth shook and trembled under our feet there\nwas a terrific roar and the whole mountain seemed to dissolve.",
    "We were flung headlong\nthrough the air.",
    "I came to myself at last.",
    "I was in a strange bed and a strange room.",
    "Someone was sitting by\nthe window.",
    "He turned and came and stood by me.",
    "It was Achille Poirot\u2014or stay was it\u2014\nThe wellknown ironical voice dispelled any doubts I might have had.",
    "\u201cBut yes my friend it is.",
    "Brother Achille has gone home again\u2014to the land of myths.",
    "It\nwas I all the time.",
    "It is not only Number Four who can act a part.",
    "Belladonna in the eyes the\nsacrifice of the moustaches and a real scar the inflicting of which caused me much pain two\nmonths ago\u2014but I could not risk a fake beneath the eagle eyes of Number Four.",
    "And the\nfinal touch your own knowledge and belief that there was such a person as Achille Poirot\nIt was invaluable the assistance you rendered me half the success of the coup is due to you\nThe whole crux of the affair was to make them believe that Hercule Poirot was still at large\ndirecting operations.",
    "Otherwise everything was true the aniseed the cordon etc.\u201d\n\u201cBut why not really send a substitute\u201d\n\u201cAnd let you go into danger without me by your side You have a pretty idea of me\nthere Besides I always had a hope of finding a way out through the countess.\u201d\n\u201cHow on earth did you manage to convince her It was a pretty thin story to make her\nswallow\u2014all that about a dead child.\u201d\n\u201cThe countess has a great deal more perspicacity than you have my dear Hastings.",
    "She\nwas taken in at first by my disguise but she soon saw through it.",
    "When she said \u2018You are\nvery clever M. Achille Poirot\u2019 I knew that she had guessed the truth.",
    "It was then or never\nto play my trump card.\u201d\n\u201cAll that rigmarole about bringing the dead to life\u201d\n\u201cExactly\u2014but then you see I had the child all along.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cBut yes You know my motto\u2014Be prepared.",
    "As soon as I found that the Countess\nRossakoff was mixed up with the Big Four I had every possible inquiry made as to her\nantecedents.",
    "I learnt that she had had a child who was reported to have been killed and I\nalso found that there were discrepancies in the story which led me to wonder whether it\nmight not after all be alive.",
    "In the end I succeeded in tracing the boy and by paying out a\nbig sum I obtained possession of the child\u2019s person.",
    "The poor little fellow was nearly dead\nof starvation.",
    "I placed him in a safe place with kindly people and took a snapshot of him in\n\n\fhis new surroundings.",
    "And so when the time came I had my little coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre all\nready\u201d\n\u201cYou are wonderful Poirot absolutely wonderful\u201d\n\u201cI was glad to do it too.",
    "For I had admired the countess.",
    "I should have been sorry if she\nhad perished in the explosion.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been half afraid to ask you\u2014what of the Big Four\u201d\n\u201cAll the bodies have now been recovered.",
    "That of Number Four was quite\nunrecognizable the head blown to pieces.",
    "I wish\u2014I rather wish it had not been so.",
    "I should\nhave liked to be sure\u2014but no more of that.",
    "Look at this.\u201d\nHe handed me a newspaper in which a paragraph was marked.",
    "It reported the death by\nsuicide of Li Chang Yen who had engineered the recent revolution which had failed so\ndisastrously.",
    "\u201cMy great opponent\u201d said Poirot gravely.",
    "\u201cIt was fated that he and I should never meet\nin the flesh.",
    "When he received the news of the disaster here he took the simplest way out.",
    "A\ngreat brain my friend a great brain.",
    "But I wish I had seen the face of the man who was\nNumber Four \u2026Supposing that after all\u2014but I romance.",
    "He is dead.",
    "Yes mon ami\ntogether we have faced and routed the Big Four and now you will return to your charming\nwife and I\u2014I shall retire.",
    "The great case of my life is over.",
    "Anything else will seem tame\nafter this.",
    "No I shall retire.",
    "Possibly I shall grow vegetable marrows I might even marry\nand arrange myself\u201d\nHe laughed heartily at the idea but with a touch of embarrassment.",
    "I hope \u2026 small men\nalways admire big flamboyant women\u2014\n\u201cMarry and arrange myself\u201d he said again.",
    "\u201cWho knows\u201d"
