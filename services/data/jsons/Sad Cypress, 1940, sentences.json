    "\u201cOh it does.\u201d\n    He said seriously\n    \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m mercenary.",

    "\u201cUncle Henry was\nwhat you\u2019d call I suppose comfortably off when he met your Aunt\nLaura.",
    "But she was an heiress.",
    "She and your father were both left very\nwealthy.",
    "Pity your father speculated and lost most of his.\u201d\n    Elinor sighed.",
    "\u201cPoor Father never had much business sense.",
    "He got very worried\nover things before he died.\u201d\n    \u201cYes your Aunt Laura had a much better head than he had.",
    "She\nmarried Uncle Henry and they bought Hunterbury and she told me the\nother day that she\u2019d been exceedingly lucky always in her investments.",
    "Practically nothing had slumped.\u201d\n    \u201cUncle Henry left all he had to her when he died didn\u2019t he\u201d\n    Roddy nodded.",
    "\u201cYes tragic his dying so soon.",
    "And she\u2019s never married again.",
    "Faithful old bean.",
    "And she\u2019s always been very good to us.",
    "She\u2019s treated\nme as if I was her nephew by blood.",
    "If I\u2019ve been in a hole she\u2019s helped\nme out luckily I haven\u2019t done that too often\u201d\n    \u201cShe\u2019s been awfully generous to me too\u201d said Elinor gratefully.",
    "Roddy nodded.",
    "\u201cAunt Laura\u201d he said \u201cis a brick.",
    "But you know Elinor perhaps\nwithout meaning to do so you and I live pretty extravagantly\nconsidering what our means really are\u201d\n    She said ruefully\n    \u201cI suppose we do\u2026 Everything costs so much\u2014clothes and one\u2019s\nface\u2014and just silly things like cinemas and cocktails\u2014and even\ngramophone records\u201d\n\f    Roddy said\n    \u201cDarling you are one of the lilies of the field aren\u2019t you You toil\nnot neither do you spin\u201d\n    Elinor said\n    \u201cDo you think I ought to Roddy\u201d\n    He shook his head.",
    "\u201cI like you as you are delicate and aloof and ironical.",
    "I\u2019d hate you to\ngo all earnest.",
    "I\u2019m only saying that if it weren\u2019t for Aunt Laura you\nprobably would be working at some grim job.\u201d\n    He went on\n    \u201cThe same with me.",
    "I\u2019ve got a job of sorts.",
    "Being with Lewis \nHume is not too arduous.",
    "It suits me.",

    "Naturally that fact influences our conduct.\u201d\n    Elinor said thoughtfully\n    \u201cAunt Laura has never told us definitely just how she has left her\nmoney\u201d\n    Roddy said\n    \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter In all probability she\u2019s divided it between us\nbut if that isn\u2019t so\u2014if she\u2019s left all of it or most of it to you as her own\nflesh and blood\u2014why then darling I shall share in it because I\u2019m\ngoing to marry you\u2014and if the old pet thinks the majority should go to\nme as the male representative of the Welmans that\u2019s still all right\nbecause you\u2019re marrying me.\u201d\n    He grinned at her affectionately.",
    "He said\n    \u201cLucky we happen to love each other.",
    "You do love me don\u2019t you\nElinor\u201d\n    \u201cYes.\u201d\n    She said it coldly almost primly.",

    "Being in the dead country it\u2019s difficult to\n      get maids and the girls they have got are a raw lot and some of\n      them not too obliging and though I\u2019m sure I\u2019m never one to give\n      trouble meals sent up on a tray should at least be hot and no\n      facilities for boiling a kettle and the tea not always made with\n      boiling water Still all that\u2019s neither here nor there.",

    "What I\u2019ve got to tell you that will really interest you is the very\n      queerest coincidence you ever knew.",
    "In the drawing room on the\n      grand piano there\u2019s a photograph in a big silver frame and\n      would you believe it it\u2019s the same photograph that I told you\n      about\u2014the one signed Lewis that old Mrs. Welman asked for.",
    "Well of course I was intrigued\u2014and who wouldn\u2019t be And I\n      asked the butler who it was which he answered at once saying it\n      was Lady Rattery\u2019s brother\u2014Sir Lewis Rycroft.",
    "He lived it seems\n      not far from here and he was killed in the War.",
    "Very sad wasn\u2019t\n      it I asked casual like was he married and the butler said yes\n      but that Lady Rycroft went into a lunatic asylum poor thing soon\n      after the marriage.",
    "She was still alive he said.",
    "Now isn\u2019t that\n      interesting And we were quite wrong you see in all our ideas.",
    "They must have been very fond of each other he and Mrs. W. and\n      unable to marry because of the wife being in an asylum.",
    "Just like\n      the pictures isn\u2019t it And her remembering all those years and\n      looking at his photograph just before she died.",
    "He was killed in\n      1917 the butler said.",
    "Quite a romance that\u2019s what I feel.",
    "Have you seen that new picture with Myrna Loy I saw it was\n   coming to Maidensford this week.",
    "No cinema anywhere near\n   here Oh it\u2019s awful to be buried in the country.",

    "I saw Mrs. Bishop the other day she is staying with her\n   sister who lives about a mile away.",
    "She was very upset as you\n   can imagine at the place being sold.",
    "It seems she made sure Miss\n   Carlisle would marry Mr. Welman and live there.",
    "Mrs. B. says\n   that the engagement is off Miss Carlisle went away to London\n   soon after you left.",
    "She was very peculiar in her manner once or\n   twice.",
    "I really didn\u2019t know what to make of her Mary Gerrard has\n   gone to London and is starting to train for a masseuse.",
    "Very\n   sensible of her I think.",
    "Miss Carlisle\u2019s going to settle two\n   thousand pounds on her which I call very handsome and more\n   than what many would do.",
    "By the way it\u2019s funny how things come about.",
    "Do you\n   remember telling me something about a photograph signed Lewis\n   that Mrs. Welman showed you I was having a chat the other day\n   with Mrs. Slattery she was housekeeper to old Dr. Ransome who\n   had the practice before Dr. Lord and of course she\u2019s lived here\n   all her life and knows a lot about the gentry round about.",
    "I just\n   brought the subject up in a casual manner speaking of Christian\n   names and saying that the name of Lewis was uncommon and\n   amongst others she mentioned Sir Lewis Rycroft over at Forbes\n   Park.",
    "He served in the War in the 17th Lancers and was killed\n   towards the end of the War.",
    "So I said he was a great friend of Mrs.\n   Welman\u2019s at Hunterbury wasn\u2019t he And at once she gave me a\n   look and said Yes very close friends they\u2019d been and some said\n   more than friends but that she herself wasn\u2019t one to talk\u2014and\n\f   why shouldn\u2019t they be friends So I said but surely Mrs. Welman\n   was a widow at the time and she said Oh yes she was a widow.",
    "So dear I saw at once she meant something by that so I said it\n   was odd then that they\u2019d never married and she said at once\n   \u201cThey couldn\u2019t marry.",
    "He\u2019d got a wife in a lunatic asylum\u201d So\n   now you see we know all about it Curious the way things come\n   about isn\u2019t it Considering the easy way you get divorces\n   nowadays it does seem a shame that insanity shouldn\u2019t have been\n   a ground for it then.",
    "Do you remember a goodlooking young chap Ted Bigland\n   who used to hang around after Mary Gerrard a lot He\u2019s been at\n   me for her address in London but I haven\u2019t given it to him.",
    "In my\n   opinion Mary\u2019s a cut above Ted Bigland.",
    "I don\u2019t know if you\n   realized it dear but Mr. R\u2014W\u2014was very taken with her.",
    "A pity\n   because it\u2019s made trouble.",
    "Mark my words that\u2019s the reason for\n   the engagement between him and Miss Carlisle being off.",
    "And if\n   you ask me it\u2019s hit her badly.",
    "I don\u2019t know what she saw in him\n   I\u2019m sure\u2014he wouldn\u2019t have been my cup of tea but I hear from a\n   reliable source that she\u2019s always been madly in love with him.",
    "It\n   does seem a mixup doesn\u2019t it And she\u2019s got all that money too.",
    "I believe he was always led to expect his aunt would leave him\n   something substantial.",
    "Old Gerrard at the Lodge is failing rapidly\u2014has had several\n   nasty dizzy spells.",

    "\u201cWell\u201d\n   I said \u201cI\u2019d be ashamed to say a thing like that about your wife if I\n   were you.\u201d He just looked at me and said \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a\n   fool.",

    "Be reasonable.",
    "If Elinor Carlisle or Roderick\nWelman or Nurse O\u2019Brien or even any of the servants were to open\nthat case and abstract a little glass tube what would anyone think\nSimply that the person in question had been sent by the nurse to fetch\nsomething from it.",
    "The matter would pass straight out of Mary Gerrard\u2019s\nmind again but it is possible that later she might recollect the fact and\nmight mention it casually to the person in question\u2014oh without the least\nsuspicion in the world.",
    "But to the person guilty of the murder of Mrs.\nWelman imagine the effect of that remark Mary had seen Mary must\nbe silenced at all costs I can assure you my friend that anyone who has\nonce committed a murder finds it only too easy to commit another\u201d\n    Peter Lord said with a frown\n    \u201cI\u2019ve believed all along that Mrs. Welman took the stuff herself\u2026.\u201d\n    \u201cBut she was paralysed\u2014helpless\u2014she had just had a second\nstroke.\u201d\n\f     \u201cOh I know.",
    "My idea was that having got hold of morphine\nsomehow or other she kept it by her in a receptacle close at hand.\u201d\n     \u201cBut in that case she must have got hold of the morphine before her\nsecond attack and the nurse missed it afterwards.\u201d\n     \u201cHopkins may only have missed the morphine that morning.",
    "It might\nhave been taken a couple of days before and she hadn\u2019t noticed it.\u201d\n     \u201cHow would the old lady have got hold of it\u201d\n     \u201cI don\u2019t know.",

    "We\nmay say that she wished to make sure of inheriting a large fortune.",
    "We\nmay be more generous and say that she was actuated by pity that she\ntook the morphine and administered it in compliance with her aunt\u2019s\noftenrepeated request but she took it\u2014and Mary Gerrard saw her do it.",
    "And so we are back at the sandwiches and the empty house and we have\nElinor Carlisle once more\u2014but this time with a different motive to save\nher neck.\u201d\n     Peter Lord cried out\n     \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic.",

    "He said uncertainly\n    \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot looked at the ceiling and joined his fingertips.",
    "He remarked\n    \u201cIt would be well you know to tell me.\u201d\n    \u201cTell you what\u201d\n    \u201cExactly what is in your mind\u2014no matter how damaging it may\nhappen to be to Elinor Carlisle.\u201d\n    \u201cHow do you know\u2014\u201d\n    \u201cYes yes I know.",

    "But let me hear what it is.\u201d\n    Slowly unwillingly Peter Lord allowed the story to be dragged from\nhim\u2014that scene of Elinor leaning in at the window of Nurse Hopkins\u2019\ncottage and of her laughter.",

    "She never mentioned anybody.\u201d\n    \u201cAny enemies\u2014here in Maidensford\u201d\n    \u201cYou mean anyone who had it in for her\u201d He shook his head.",
    "\u201cNobody knew her very well.",
    "But they all liked her.\u201d\n    Poirot said\n    \u201cDid Mrs. Bishop the housekeeper at Hunterbury like her\u201d\n    Ted gave a sudden grin.",
    "He said\n    \u201cOh that was just spite The old dame didn\u2019t like Mrs. Welman\ntaking such a fancy to Mary.\u201d\n    Poirot asked\n    \u201cWas Mary Gerrard happy when she was down here Was she fond\nof old Mrs. Welman\u201d\n    \u201cShe\u2019d have been happy enough I dare say if Nurse had let her\nalone.",
    "Nurse Hopkins I mean.",
    "Putting ideas into her head of earning a\nliving and going off to do massage.\u201d\n    \u201cShe was fond of Mary though\u201d\n    \u201cOh yes she was fond enough of her but she\u2019s the kind who always\nknows what\u2019s best for everyone\u201d\n    Poirot said slowly\n    \u201cSupposing that Nurse Hopkins knows something\u2014something let us\nsay that would throw a discreditable light on Mary\u2014do you think she\nwould keep it to herself\u201d\n    Ted Bigland looked at him curiously.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t quite get your meaning sir\u201d\n    \u201cDo you think that if Nurse Hopkins knew something against Mary\nGerrard she would hold her tongue about it\u201d\n    Ted Bigland said\n    \u201cI doubt if that woman could hold her tongue about anything She\u2019s\nthe greatest gossip in the village.",
    "But if she\u2019d hold her tongue about\n\fanybody it would probably be about Mary.\u201d He added his curiosity\ngetting the better of him \u201cI\u2019d like to know why you ask that\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot said\n    \u201cOne has in talking to people a certain impression.",
    "Nurse Hopkins\nwas to all seeming perfectly frank and outspoken but I formed the\nimpression\u2014very strongly\u2014that she was keeping something back.",
    "It is\nnot necessarily an important thing.",
    "It may have no bearing on the crime.",
    "But there is something that she knows which she has not told.",
    "I also\nformed the impression that this something\u2014whatever it is\u2014is something\ndefinitely damaging or detrimental to the character of Mary Gerrard\u2026.\u201d\n    Ted shook his head helplessly.",
    "Hercule Poirot sighed\n    \u201cAh well.",
    "I shall learn what it is in time.\u201d\n\fSix\n\n\n\n\nPoirot looked with interest at the long sensitive face of Roderick\nWelman.",
    "Roddy\u2019s nerves were in a pitiable condition.",
    "His hands twitched his\neyes were bloodshot his voice was husky and irritable.",
    "He said looking down at the card\n    \u201cOf course I know your name M. Poirot.",
    "But I don\u2019t see what Dr.\nLord thinks you can do in this matter And anyway what business is it\nof his He attended my aunt but otherwise he\u2019s a complete stranger.",
    "Elinor and I had not even met him until we went down there this June.",
    "Surely it is Seddon\u2019s business to attend to all this sort of thing\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot said\n    \u201cTechnically that is correct.\u201d\n    Roddy went on unhappily\n    \u201cNot that Seddon gives me much confidence.",
    "He\u2019s so confoundedly\ngloomy.\u201d\n    \u201cIt is a habit that of lawyers.\u201d\n    \u201cStill\u201d said Roddy cheering up a little \u201cwe\u2019ve briefed Bulmer.",
    "He\u2019s\nsupposed to be pretty well at the top of the tree isn\u2019t he\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot said\n    \u201cHe has a reputation for leading forlorn hopes.\u201d\n    Roddy winced palpably.",
    "Poirot said\n    \u201cIt does not displease you I hope that I should endeavour to be of\nassistance to Miss Elinor Carlisle\u201d\n    \u201cNo no of course not.",
    "But\u2014\u201d\n    \u201cBut what can I do It is that that you would ask\u201d\n    A quick smile flashed across Roddy\u2019s worried face\u2014a smile so\nsuddenly charming that Hercule Poirot understood the subtle attraction\nof the man.",
    "Roddy said apologetically\n    \u201cIt sounds a little rude put like that.",
    "But really of course that is the\npoint.",
    "I won\u2019t beat about the bush.",
    "What can you do M. Poirot\u201d\n\f    Poirot said\n    \u201cI can search for the truth.\u201d\n    \u201cYes.\u201d Roddy sounded a little doubtful.",
    "Poirot said\n    \u201cI might discover facts that would be helpful to the accused.\u201d\n    Roddy sighed.",
    "\u201cIf you only could\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot went on\n    \u201cIt is my earnest desire to be helpful.",
    "Will you assist me by telling\nme just exactly what you think of the whole business\u201d\n    Roddy got up and walked restlessly up and down.",
    "\u201cWhat can I say The whole thing\u2019s so absurd\u2014so fantastic The\nmere idea of Elinor\u2014Elinor whom I\u2019ve known since she was a child\u2014\nactually doing such a melodramatic thing as poisoning someone.",
    "It\u2019s\nquite laughable of course But how on earth explain that to a jury\u201d\n    Poirot said stolidly\n    \u201cYou consider it quite impossible that Miss Carlisle should have done\nsuch a thing\u201d\n    \u201cOh quite That goes without saying Elinor\u2019s an exquisite creature\u2014\nbeautifully poised and balanced\u2014no violence in her nature.",
    "She\u2019s\nintellectual sensitive and altogether devoid of animal passions.",
    "But get\ntwelve fatheaded fools in a jury box and God knows what they can be\nmade to believe After all let\u2019s be reasonable they\u2019re not there to judge\ncharacter they\u2019re there to sift evidence.",
    "Facts\u2014facts\u2014facts.",
    "And the\nfacts are unfortunate\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "He said\n    \u201cYou are a person Mr. Welman of sensibility and intelligence.",
    "The\nfacts condemn Miss Carlisle.",
    "Your knowledge of her acquits her.",
    "What\nthen really happened What can have happened\u201d\n    Roddy spread out his hands in exasperation.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the devil of it all I suppose the nurse couldn\u2019t have done it\u201d\n    \u201cShe was never near the sandwiches\u2014oh I have made the inquiries\nvery minutely\u2014and she could not have poisoned the tea without\npoisoning herself as well.",
    "I have made quite sure of that.",
    "Moreover why\nshould she wish to kill Mary Gerrard\u201d\n    Roddy cried out\n    \u201cWhy should anyone wish to kill Mary Gerrard\u201d\n    \u201cThat\u201d said Poirot \u201cseems to be the unanswerable question in this\ncase.",
    "No one wished to kill Mary Gerrard.\u201d He added in his own mind\n\f\u201cExcept Elinor Carlisle.\u201d \u201cTherefore the next step logically would\nseem to be Mary Gerrard was not killed But that alas is not so.",
    "She\nwas killed\u201d\n   He added slightly melodramatically\n\n   \u201cBut she is in her grave and oh\n   The difference to me\u201d\n\n    \u201cI beg your pardon\u201d said Roddy.",

    "As it is so well expressed in your language there are\nthings that one does not say.",
    "But alas a detective is forced to say them\nHe must ask questions about people\u2019s private affairs about their\nfeelings\u201d\n    Roddy said\n    \u201cSurely all this is quite unnecessary\u201d\n    Poirot said quickly and humbly\n    \u201cIf I might just understand the position Then we will pass from the\nunpleasant subject and not refer to it again.",
    "It is fairly widely known Mr.\nWelman that you\u2014admired Mary Gerrard That is I think true\u201d\n    Roddy got up and stood by the window.",

    "He said\n     \u201cYes I understand\u2026.\u201d\n     He added\n     \u201cYou were not in England yourself at the time of her death\u201d\n     \u201cNo I went abroad on July 9th and returned on August 1st.",
    "Elinor\u2019s\ntelegram followed me about from place to place.",

    "It will not permit you to escape emotion to live by the\nintellect and by reason You cannot say \u2018I will feel so much and no\nmore.\u2019 Life Mr. Welman whatever else it is is not reasonable\u201d\n     Roderick Welman murmured\n     \u201cSo it seems\u2026.\u201d\n     Poirot said\n     \u201cA spring morning a girl\u2019s face\u2014and the wellordered sequence of\nexistence is routed.\u201d\n     Roddy winced and Poirot went on\n     \u201cSometimes it is little more than that\u2014a face.",
    "What did you really\nknow of Mary Gerrard Mr. Welman\u201d\n     Roddy said heavily\n\f    \u201cWhat did I know So little I see that now.",

    "As a matter of fact I burnt it.\u201d\n    \u201cNow why did you do that Mr. Welman\u201d\n    Roddy said rather stiffly\n    \u201cIt seemed the natural thing to do at the time.\u201d\n    Poirot said\n    \u201cAnd in consequence of this letter you and Miss Carlisle went\nhurriedly down to Hunterbury\u201d\n    \u201cWe went down yes.",
    "I don\u2019t know about hurriedly.\u201d\n    \u201cBut you were a little uneasy were you not Perhaps even a little\nalarmed\u201d\n\f    Roddy said even more stiffly\n    \u201cI won\u2019t admit that.\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot cried\n    \u201cBut surely that was only natural Your inheritance\u2014that which was\npromised you\u2014was in jeopardy Surely it is natural that you should be\nunquiet about the matter Money it is very important\u201d\n    \u201cNot as important as you make out.\u201d\n    Poirot said\n    \u201cSuch unworldliness is indeed remarkable\u201d\n    Roddy flushed.",
    "He said\n    \u201cOh of course the money did matter to us.",
    "We weren\u2019t completely\nindifferent to it.",
    "But our main object was to\u2014to see my aunt and make\nsure she was all right.\u201d\n    Poirot said\n    \u201cYou went down there with Miss Carlisle.",
    "At that time your aunt had\nnot made a will.",
    "Shortly afterwards she had another attack of her illness.",
    "She then wished to make a will but conveniently for Miss Carlisle\nperhaps she dies that night before that will can be made.\u201d\n    \u201cLook here what are you hinting at\u201d\n    Roddy\u2019s face was wrathful.",
    "Poirot answered him like a flash\n    \u201cYou have told me Mr. Welman as regards the death of Mary\nGerrard that the motive attributed to Elinor Carlisle is absurd\u2014that she\nwas emphatically not that kind of a person.",
    "But there is now another\ninterpretation.",
    "Elinor Carlisle had reason to fear that she might be\ndisinherited in favour of an outsider.",
    "The letter has warned her\u2014her\naunt\u2019s broken murmurings confirm that fear.",
    "In the hall below is an\nattach\u00e9 case with various drugs and medical supplies.",
    "It is easy to\nabstract a tube of morphine.",
    "And afterwards so I have learned she sits in\nthe sick room alone with her aunt while you and the nurses are at\ndinner\u2026.\u201d\n    Roddy cried\n    \u201cGood God M. Poirot what are you suggesting now That Elinor\nkilled Aunt Laura Of all the ridiculous ideas\u201d\n    Poirot said\n    \u201cBut you know do you not that an order to exhume Mrs. Welman\u2019s\nbody has been applied for\u201d\n    \u201cYes I know.",
    "But they won\u2019t find anything\u201d\n    \u201cSuppose they do\u201d\n    \u201cThey won\u2019t\u201d Roddy spoke positively.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cI am not so sure.",
    "And there was only one person you realize who\nwould benefit by Mrs. Welman\u2019s dying at that moment\u2026.\u201d\n     Roddy sat down.",

    "What then\u201d\n     Roddy shook his head helplessly.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n     \u201cBut you must try to think.",
    "Who could have given it to her You must\nadmit that Elinor Carlisle had the best opportunity to do so\u201d\n     \u201cWhat about the nurses\u201d\n     \u201cEither of them could have done so certainly.",
    "But Nurse Hopkins\nwas concerned about the disappearance of the tube at the time and\nmentioned it openly.",
    "There was no need for her to do so.",
    "The death\ncertificate had been signed.",
    "Why call attention to the missing morphine if\nshe were guilty It will probably bring her censure for carelessness as it\nis and if she poisoned Mrs. Welman it was surely idiotic to draw\nattention to the morphine.",
    "Besides what could she gain by Mrs.\nWelman\u2019s death Nothing.",
    "The same applies to Nurse O\u2019Brien.",
    "She\ncould have administered morphine could have taken it from Nurse\nHopkins\u2019 case but again\u2014why should she\u201d\n     Roddy shook his head.",
    "\u201cAll that\u2019s true enough.\u201d\n     Poirot said\n     \u201cThen there is yourself.\u201d\n     Roddy started like a nervous horse.",
    "\u201cMe\u201d\n     \u201cCertainly.",
    "You could have abstracted the morphine.",
    "You could have\ngiven it to Mrs. Welman You were alone with her for a short period that\n\fnight.",
    "But again why should you If she lived to make a will it is at\nleast probable that you would have been mentioned in it.",
    "So again you\nsee there is no motive.",
    "Only two people had a motive.\u201d\n    Roddy\u2019s eyes brightened.",
    "\u201cTwo people\u201d\n    \u201cYes.",
    "One was Elinor Carlisle.\u201d\n    \u201cAnd the other\u201d\n    Poirot said slowly\n    \u201cThe other was the writer of that anonymous letter.\u201d\n    Roddy looked incredulous.",
    "Poirot said\n    \u201cSomebody wrote that letter\u2014somebody who hated Mary Gerrard or\nat least disliked her\u2014somebody who was as they say \u2018on your side.\u2019\nSomebody that is who did not want Mary Gerrard to benefit at Mrs.\nWelman\u2019s death.",
    "Now have you any idea Mr. Welman who the writer of\nthat letter could be\u201d\n    Roddy shook his head.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve no idea at all.",
    "It was an illiterate letter misspelt cheap\nlooking.\u201d\n    Poirot waved a hand.",
    "\u201cThere is nothing much to that It might easily have been written by\nan educated person who chose to disguise the fact.",
    "That is why I wish\nyou had the letter still.",
    "People who try to write in an uneducated manner\nusually give themselves away.\u201d\n    Roddy said thoughtfully\n    \u201cElinor and I thought it might be one of the servants.\u201d\n    \u201cHad you any idea which of them\u201d\n    \u201cNo\u2014no idea whatsoever.\u201d\n    \u201cCould it do you think have been Mrs. Bishop the housekeeper\u201d\n    Roddy looked shocked.",
    "\u201cOh no she\u2019s a most respectable highandmighty creature.",
    "Writes\nbeautifully involved and ornate letters with long words in them.",
    "Besides\nI\u2019m sure she would never\u2014\u201d\n    As he hesitated Poirot cut in\n    \u201cShe did not like Mary Gerrard\u201d\n    \u201cI suppose she didn\u2019t.",
    "I never noticed anything though.\u201d\n    \u201cBut perhaps Mr. Welman you do not notice very much\u201d\n    Roddy said slowly\n    \u201cYou don\u2019t think M.

    "Poirot said quietly\n    \u201cYou have remembered something have you not\u201d\n    Roddy said doubtfully\n    \u201cYes\u2014but\u2014\u201d\n    \u201cYou wonder if you ought to tell me\u201d\n    \u201cWell yes\u2026.\u201d\n    Poirot said a curious smile tilting the corners of his mouth\n    \u201cWhen did Miss Carlisle say it\u201d\n    Roddy drew a deep breath.",
    "\u201cBy Jove you are a wizard It was in the train coming down.",
    "We\u2019d\nhad the telegram you know saying Aunt Laura had had another stroke.",
    "Elinor said how terribly sorry she was for her how the poor dear hated\nbeing ill and that now she would be more helpless still and that it would\nbe absolute hell for her.",
    "Elinor said \u2018One does feel that people ought to\nbe set free if they themselves really want it.\u2019\u201d\n    \u201cAnd you said\u2014what\u201d\n    \u201cI agreed.\u201d\n    Poirot spoke very gravely\n    \u201cJust now Mr. Welman you scouted the possibility of Miss Carlisle\nhaving killed your aunt for monetary gain.",
    "Do you also scout the\npossibility that she may have killed Mrs. Welman out of compassion\u201d\n    Roddy said\n    \u201cI\u2014I\u2014no I can\u2019t\u2026.\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot bowed his head.",

    "I really do not think we need any outside assistance in this case.\u201d\n    Poirot asked\n    \u201cIs that because your client\u2019s innocence will be so easily proved\u201d\n    Mr. Seddon winced.",
    "Then he became wrathful in a dry legal fashion.",

    "I\nmay say we have already briefed Sir Edwin Bulmer K.C.\u201d\n    Poirot said and his smile was suddenly ironic\n    \u201cNo expense will be spared.",
    "Very right and proper\u201d\n    Looking over his glasses Mr. Seddon said\n    \u201cReally M. Poirot\u2014\u201d\n    Poirot cut into his protest.",
    "\u201cEloquence and emotional appeal will not save your client.",

    "She might not see but\nHercule Poirot would\u201d\n    Peter Lord said shaking his head\n    \u201cI\u2019m sorry.",
    "I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n    Poirot said thoughtfully\n    \u201cNo more does Ted Bigland\u2014and he has lived here all his life and\nMary\u2019s.",

    "She was only\nhere for a month or two.\u201d\n    Poirot said\n    \u201cI am aware of that.",
    "But my friend Nurse Hopkins we have been\ntold has the long tongue.",
    "She has not gossiped in the village where such\ntalk might have done Mary Gerrard harm.",
    "But I doubt if she could refrain\nfrom giving at least a hint about something that was occupying her mind\nto a stranger and a colleague Nurse O\u2019Brien may know something.\u201d\n\fTen\n\n\n\n\nNurse O\u2019Brien tossed her red head and smiled widely across the tea table\nat the little man opposite her.",

    "\u201cIndeed and he was right.",
    "It does a doctor no good to think things and\noffend the family and then if he\u2019s wrong it\u2019s the end of him and no one\nwould be wishing to call him in any more.",

    "\u2018I\u2019m sure I had it here\u2019 she said.",
    "Very sure\nshe was at first but you know how it is after a while your mind gets\nconfused and in the end she made sure she\u2019d left it at home.\u201d\n    Poirot murmured\n    \u201cAnd even then you had no suspicion\u201d\n    \u201cNot the least in the world Sure it never entered my head for a\nmoment that things weren\u2019t as they should be.",
    "And even now \u2019tis only a\nsuspicion they have.\u201d\n    \u201cThe thought of that missing tube never caused either you or Nurse\nHopkins an uneasy moment\u201d\n    \u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2026 I do remember that it came into my head\n\u2014and into Nurse Hopkins\u2019 head too I believe\u2014in the Blue Tit Caf\u00e9 we\nwere at the time.",

    "All the same\nI haven\u2019t liked to destroy it because I didn\u2019t feel somehow it would be\nright to do that.",
    "But there you\u2019d better read it yourself.\u201d\n    Poirot drew out the sheet of paper covered in small angular writing\n\n   This is the truth I\u2019ve written down here in case it should ever be\n   needed.",

    "The arrangement was that we should marry and live at the Lodge\n   and he should think that the baby was mine.",

    "She thought it would be better for Mary\n   never to know the truth.",
    "Mrs. Welman gave us both a handsome\n   sum of money but I would have helped her without that.",
    "I\u2019ve been\n   quite happy with Bob but he never took to Mary.",

    "That day I bought\nthe paste and cut the sandwiches I was pretending to myself I was\nthinking \u2018I\u2019ve mixed poison with this and when she eats she will die\u2014\nand then Roddy will come back to me.\u2019\u201d\n    Peter Lord said\n    \u201cIt helps some people to pretend that sort of thing to themselves.",
    "It\nisn\u2019t a bad thing really.",
    "You take it out of yourself in a fantasy.",
    "Like\nsweating a thing out of your system.\u201d\n    Elinor said\n    \u201cYes that\u2019s true.",

    "Just common sense.\u201d\n    Elinor said and there were suddenly tears in her eyes\n    \u201cEvery now and then\u2014in court\u2014I looked at you.",

    "He said\n    \u201cYou\u2019ll be quite safe here.",
    "No one will bother you.\u201d\n    Impulsively she laid her hand on his arm.",

    "\u201cOh yes For one reason or another you comprehend.",
    "The one\nperson to whom truth was an obligation and who was sensitive and\nscrupulous concerning it\u2014that person was the one who puzzled me\nmost\u201d\n    Peter Lord murmured\n    \u201cElinor herself\u201d\n    \u201cPrecisely.",
    "The evidence pointed to her as the guilty party.",
    "And she\nherself with her sensitive and fastidious conscience did nothing to\ndispel that assumption.",
    "Accusing herself of the will if not the deed she\ncame very near to abandoning a distasteful and sordid fight and pleading\nguilty in court to a crime she had not committed.\u201d\n    Peter Lord breathed a sigh of exasperation.",
    "\u201cIncredible.\u201d\n    Poirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cNot at all.",
    "She condemned herself\u2014because she judged herself by a\nmore exacting standard than ordinary humanity applies\u201d\n    Peter Lord said thoughtfully\n    \u201cYes she\u2019s like that.\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot went on\n    \u201cFrom the moment that I started my investigations there was always\nthe strong possibility that Elinor Carlisle was guilty of the crime of\nwhich she was accused.",
    "But I fulfilled my obligations towards you and I\ndiscovered that a fairly strong case could be made out against another\nperson.\u201d\n    \u201cNurse Hopkins\u201d\n\f     \u201cNot to begin with.",
    "Roderick Welman was the first person to attract\nmy attention.",
    "In his case again we start with a lie.",
    "He told me that he\nleft England on July 9th and returned on August 1st.",
    "But Nurse Hopkins\nhad mentioned casually that Mary Gerrard had rebuffed Roderick.",
    "Welman\u2019s advances both in Maidensford \u2018and again when she saw him in\nLondon.\u2019 Mary Gerrard you informed me went to London on July 10th\n\u2014a day after Roderick Welman had left England.",
    "When then did Mary\nGerrard have an interview with Roderick Welman in London I set my\nburglarious friend to work and by an examination of Welman\u2019s passport\nI discovered that he had been in England from July 25th to the 27th.",
    "And\nhe had deliberately lied about it.",
    "\u201cThere had always been that period of time in my mind when the\nsandwiches were on a plate in the pantry and Elinor Carlisle was down at\nthe Lodge.",
    "But all along I realized that in that case Elinor must have\nbeen the intended victim not Mary.",
    "Had Roderick Welman any motive\nfor killing Elinor Carlisle Yes a very good one.",
    "She had made a will\nleaving him her entire fortune and by adroit questioning I discovered\nthat Roderick Welman could have made himself acquainted with that\nfact.\u201d\n     Peter Lord said\n     \u201cAnd why did you decide that he was innocent\u201d\n     \u201cBecause of one more lie.",
    "Such a silly stupid negligible little lie too.",
    "Nurse Hopkins said that she had scratched her wrist on a rose tree that\nshe had got a thorn in it.",
    "And I went and saw the rose tree and it had no\nthorns\u2026 So clearly Nurse Hopkins had told a lie\u2014and the lie was so\nsilly and so seemingly pointless that it focused my attention upon her.",
    "\u201cI began to wonder about Nurse Hopkins.",
    "Up till then she had struck\nme as a perfectly credible witness consistent throughout with a strong\nbias against the accused arising naturally enough out of her affection for\nthe dead girl.",
    "But now with that silly pointless little lie in my mind I\nconsidered Nurse Hopkins and her evidence very carefully and I realized\nsomething that I had not been clever enough to see before.",
    "Nurse\nHopkins knew something about Mary Gerrard which she was very\nanxious should come out.\u201d\n     Peter Lord said in surprise\n     \u201cI thought it was the other way round\u201d\n     \u201cOstensibly yes.",
    "She gave a very fine performance of someone who\nknows something and isn\u2019t going to tell But when I thought it over\ncarefully I realized that every word she had said on the subject had been\nuttered with diametrically the opposite end in view.",
    "My conversation\n\fwith Nurse O\u2019Brien confirmed that belief.",
    "Hopkins had used her very\ncleverly without Nurse O\u2019Brien being conscious of the fact.",
    "\u201cIt was clear then that Nurse Hopkins had a game of her own to play.",
    "I contrasted the two lies her and Roderick Welman\u2019s.",
    "Was either of them\ncapable of an innocent explanation\n    \u201cIn Roderick\u2019s case I answered immediately Yes.",
    "Roderick Welman\nis a very sensitive creature.",
    "To admit that he had been unable to keep to\nhis plan of staying abroad and had been compelled to slink back and\nhang round the girl who would have nothing to do with him would have\nbeen most hurtful to his pride.",
    "Since there was no question of his having\nbeen near the scene of the murder or of knowing anything about it he\ntook the line of least resistance and avoided unpleasantness a most\ncharacteristic trait by ignoring that hurried visit to England and simply\nstating that he returned on August 1st when the news of the murder\nreached him.",
    "\u201cNow as to Nurse Hopkins could there be an innocent explanation of\nher lie The more I thought of it the more extraordinary it seemed to me.",
    "Why should Nurse Hopkins find it necessary to lie because she had a\nmark on her wrist What was the significance of that mark\n    \u201cI began to ask myself certain questions.",
    "Who did the morphine that\nwas stolen belong to Nurse Hopkins.",
    "Who could have administered that\nmorphine to old Mrs. Welman Nurse Hopkins.",
    "Yes but why call\nattention to its disappearance There could be only one answer to that if\nNurse Hopkins was guilty because the other murder the murder of Mary\nGerrard was already planned and a scapegoat had been selected but\nthat scapegoat must be shown to have had a chance of obtaining\nmorphine.",
    "\u201cCertain other things fitted in.",
    "The anonymous letter written to\nElinor.",
    "That was to create bad feeling between Elinor and Mary.",
    "The idea\ndoubtless was that Elinor would come down and object to Mary\u2019s\ninfluence over Mrs. Welman.",
    "The fact that Roderick Welman fell\nviolently in love with Mary was of course a totally unforeseen\ncircumstance\u2014but one that Nurse Hopkins was quick to appreciate.",
    "Here\nwas a perfect motive for the scapegoat Elinor.",
    "\u201cBut what was the reason for the two crimes What motive could\nthere be for Nurse Hopkins to do away with Mary Gerrard I began to\nsee a light\u2014oh very dim as yet.",
    "Nurse Hopkins had a good deal of\ninfluence over Mary and one of the ways she had used that influence\nwas to induce the girl to make a will.",
    "But the will did not benefit Nurse\nHopkins.",
    "It benefited an aunt of Mary\u2019s who lived in New Zealand.",
    "And\n\fthen I remembered a chance remark that someone in the village had\nmade to me.",
    "That aunt had been a hospital nurse.",
    "\u201cThe light was not quite so dim now.",
    "The pattern\u2014the design of the\ncrime\u2014was becoming apparent.",
    "The next step was easy.",
    "I visited Nurse\nHopkins once more.",
    "We both played the comedy very prettily.",
    "In the end\nshe allowed herself to be persuaded to tell what she had been aiming to\ntell all along Only she tells it perhaps just a little sooner than she meant\nto do But the opportunity is so good that she cannot resist.",
    "And after\nall the truth has got to be known some time.",
    "So with wellfeigned\nreluctance she produces the letter.",
    "And then my friend it is no longer\nconjecture.",
    "I know The letter gives her away.\u201d\n     Peter Lord frowned and said\n     \u201cHow\u201d\n     \u201cMon cher The superscription on that letter was as follows \u2018For\nMary to be sent to her after my death.\u2019 But the gist of the contents made\nit perfectly plain that Mary Gerrard was not to know the truth.",
    "Also the\nword sent not given on the envelope was illuminating.",
    "It was not Mary\nGerrard to whom that letter was written but another Mary.",
    "It was to her\nsister Mary Riley in New Zealand that Eliza Riley wrote the truth.",
    "\u201cNurse Hopkins did not find that letter at the Lodge after Mary\nGerrard\u2019s death.",
    "She had had it in her possession for many years.",
    "She\nreceived it in New Zealand where it was sent to her after her sister\u2019s\ndeath.\u201d\n     He paused.",
    "\u201cOnce one had seen the truth with the eyes of the mind the rest was\neasy.",
    "The quickness of air travel made it possible for a witness who knew\nMary Draper well in New Zealand to be present in court.\u201d\n     Peter Lord said\n     \u201cSupposing you had been wrong and Nurse Hopkins and Mary\nDraper had been two entirely different people\u201d\n     Poirot said coldly\n     \u201cI am never wrong\u201d\n     Peter Lord laughed\n     Hercule Poirot went on\n     \u201cMy friend we know something now of this woman Mary Riley or\nDraper.",
    "The police of New Zealand were unable to get sufficient\nevidence for a conviction but they had been watching her for some time\nwhen she suddenly left the country.",
    "There was a patient of hers an old\nlady who left her \u2018dear Nurse Riley\u2019 a very snug little legacy and whose\ndeath was somewhat of a puzzle to the doctor attending her.",
    "Mary\n\fDraper\u2019s husband insured his life in her favour for a considerable sum\nand his death was sudden and unaccountable.",
    "Unfortunately for her\nthough he had made out a cheque to the Insurance Company he had\nforgotten to post it.",
    "Other deaths may lie at her door.",
    "It is certain she is a\nremorseless and unscrupulous woman.",
    "\u201cOne can imagine that her sister\u2019s letter suggested possibilities to her\nresourceful mind.",
    "When New Zealand became too hot as you say to\nhold her and she came to this country and resumed her profession in the\nname of Hopkins a former colleague of hers in hospital who died\nabroad Maidensford was her objective.",
    "She may perhaps have\ncontemplated some form of blackmail.",
    "But old Mrs. Welman was not the\nkind of woman to allow herself to be blackmailed and Nurse Riley or\nHopkins very wisely did not attempt anything of the sort.",
    "Doubtless she\nmade inquiries and discovered that Mrs. Welman was a very wealthy\nwoman and some chance word of Mrs. Welman\u2019s may have revealed the\nfact that the old lady had not made a will.",
    "\u201cSo on that June evening when Nurse O\u2019Brien retailed to her\ncolleague that Mrs. Welman was asking for her lawyer Hopkins did not\nhesitate.",
    "Mrs. Welman must die intestate so that her illegitimate daughter\nwould inherit her money.",
    "Hopkins had already made friends with Mary\nGerrard and acquired a good deal of influence over the girl.",
    "All that she\nhad to do now was to persuade the girl to make a will leaving her money\nto her mother\u2019s sister and she inspired the wording of that will very\ncarefully.",
    "There was no mention of the relationship just \u2018Mary Riley\nsister of the late Eliza Riley.\u2019 Once that was signed Mary Gerrard was\ndoomed.",
    "The woman only had to wait for a suitable opportunity.",
    "She\nhad I fancy already planned the method of the crime with the use of the\napomorphine to secure her own alibi.",
    "She may have meant to get Elinor\nand Mary to her cottage but when Elinor came down to the Lodge and\nasked them both to come up and have sandwiches she realized at once\nthat a perfect opportunity had arisen.",
    "The circumstances were such that\nElinor was practically certain to be convicted.\u201d\n    Peter Lord said slowly\n    \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for you\u2014she would have been convicted.\u201d\n    Hercule Poirot said quickly\n    \u201cNo it is you my friend she has to thank for her life.\u201d\n    \u201cI I didn\u2019t do anything.",
